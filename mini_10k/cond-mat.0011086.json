Moro 2, 00185 Roma Italy\nA cellular model introduced for the evolution of the fluvial landscape is revisited using extensive\nnumerical and scaling analyses. The basic network shapes and their recurrence especially in the\naggregation structure are then addressed. The roles of boundary and initial conditions are carefully\nanalyzed as well as the key effect of quenched disorder embedded in random pinning of the landscape\nsurface. It is found that the above features strongly affect the scaling behavior of key morphological\nquantities. In particular, we conclude that randomly pinned regions (whose structural disorder bears\nmuch physical meaning mimicking uneven landscape-forming rainfall events, geological diversity or\nheterogeneity in surficial properties like vegetation, soil cover or type) play a key role for the robust\nemergence of aggregation patterns bearing much resemblance to real river networks.\n\nthe simplest possible, parameter-free models capable of\nallowing the emergence of complexity.\nA flowrate unit is associated with each pixel and the\nflow contributing to any pixel follows the steepest descent\npath through drainage directions whose collection defines\nthe planar structure under consideration. The resulting\nnetwork is therefore the two-dimensional projection of\nthe three-dimensional tree-like structure of the steepest\ndescent paths draining a given basin. The planar patterns of network aggregation are obtained by employing\nthe cellular model for the evolution of a fluvial landscape\noriginally introduced by [15] and further studied in [16]\nIt is aimed at describing in a crucially simple manner\nthe sole fluvial component of landscape evolution. Although such component must be coupled to other - chiefly\nhillslope - transport processes to yield a comprehensive\ndynamical description [11,14,17\u201319], it rules the planar\nimprinting of the network. Hence the detailed study of\nthe model is deemed significant.\nStarting from a three dimensional landscape, evolution occurs according to a threshold dynamics similar to\nthe one proposed in self organized critical (SOC) models [20]. The main idea of the erosion dynamics is that\nwhenever the local shear stress exceeds a given threshold,\nerosion starts an 'avalanche' and a related rearrangement\nof the network patterns takes place. The model of selforganizing fluvial structures may be seen as a modification of the sandpile model developed as a paradigm of\nthe dynamics of open, dissipative systems with many degrees of freedom. It may be thought of as belonging to the\nset of models in which the threshold for activity, say \u03c4c ,\nrather than being a constant value, depends on non-local\nproperties of the self-organizing structure. In the fluvial\ncase, the non-local character of the threshold value follows from the fact that the threshold\n\u221a at the arbitrary site\nequals a shear stress, i.e. \u03c4 \u221d \u2207h a, where h is the local\nlandscape elevation and a is total contributing area surrogating total flow collected from a distributed rainfall\nevent. As such, the exceedence of \u03c4c depends not only\non local conditions (i.e., a critical value of \u2207h), but also\non non-local conditions defined by the contributing area\na computed through drainage directions, i.e. it depends\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThrough experimental studies, it has become evident\nin the past few years that the geometrical and topological structures of river basins are characterized by the\nabsence of a single well-defined length scale. This is reflected in the appearance of power laws in the distribution of several quantities, chiefly total contributing area\nat a point [1] and stream lengths [2\u20135], and by the clear\nexperimental assessment of scaling properties (yielding\neither self-similarity or self-affinity [6]) for many geometrical descriptors of the river basin [7\u20139]. The discovery\nof the general underlying mechanisms yielding scale-free\nfeatures is the present theoretical challenge.\nThe network associated to a given natural terrain pertaining to a river basin can be experimentally analyzed\nby using the so-called Digital Elevation Map (DEM) technique [2,9\u201313] which allows to determine the average\nheight of areas (pixels) of the order 10\u22122 Km2 . Thus a fluvial basin is represented in a objective manner often over\n4 log scales of linear size. Lower bounds are imposed by\nchannel initiation processes at O(10\u2212100) m. Crossovers\nof geological nature provide altered aggregation processes\nand thus an upper cutoff, usually beyond scales of O(105\n- 106 ) m. Thus the observational evidence yields a much\nreliable framework over many scales for comparison with\ndynamical models aimed at the origin of scale-free features.\nMuch interest has been recently attracted by landscape evolution models. Chief among those are the detailed deterministic models which address the description\nof the detailed dynamics acting on the landscapes [14].\nThe reductionist approach, where a precise description of\nthe details of the dynamics is sought, is successful, and\nmuch interesting, in the pursuit of the description and\nthe classification of landforms. Nevertheless, as standard\nin critical phenomena, the mechanism producing scalefree structures is expected to depend only on a few key\nfeatures common to all the networks rather than on the\ndetails of the particular system under study. Hence in\nthis work, centered on the dynamic origin of fractal river\nnetworks, we follow a nonreductionist approach based on\n1\n\n\fconditions, in particular with regard to the robustness to\nsingle/multiple outlet arrangements.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the first section 1\nthe model is recalled. Section 2 presents the results with\nemphasis on scaling analyses, while the following section\nfocuses on the important effects of quenched pinning on\nthe system. A set of conclusions closes then the paper.\n\non the entire state of the system which is self-organizing.\nNotice that the physical rationale for the nonlocal dependence lies in the fact that the system is open, i.e. injected\nfrom outside, allowing flow rates to be proportional to total contributing drainage area. The long-range nature of\nthe threshold dynamics tends to hide from the observer\nthe temporal fluctuations which take place in the evolutionary time scale. In this sense the above model was\nclassified [15] as one of spatial self-organized criticality.\nWhether or not river self-organization qualifies as a\nmore general framework of self-organized criticality remains to be seen. If SOC must necessarily refer to the\noccurrence of a critical state in the sense of critical phenomena, where a small local perturbation can cause a\nsignificant change in the configuration of the whole system and thus the system shows both spatial and temporal scaling, then the time dynamics should be specifically\nconsidered. One way to do this is through the oscillation\nof the threshold in time, i.e. \u03c4c (t), simulating climatic\nfluctuations (see [21]), through which indeed temporal\nevolution appear, or through perturbations of random\nlocation and strength in the evolution of the landscape.\nThis is also true, as we will discuss later, if the landscapeforming rainfall events are described as nonuniform in\nspace, leading to patches of activity randomly scattered\nspatially (in such a case the outflow response of the system becomes a 1/f signal). However, regardless of any\nadditional features, we believe that the central scope of\nSOC is the dynamic explanation of the growth of fractal structures of the type appearing in nature, i.e. the\nphysics of fractals. As such we feel that our classification\nof the model as a particular case of SOC is a suitable\none regardless of the description of the embedded temporal activity because the system always reaches a fractal state. Moreover, questioning on this basis [23] the\nself-organized critical nature of the model by Ref. [15] is\nirrelevant because it has been shown on thermodynamics grounds that scaling properties of energy and entropy\nyield limit states which, depending on the constraints,\nare temporally frozen or active [5]. Furthermore, ref. [9]\nshows that optimal states like the ones dynamically accessed by the above model may exist in temporally active\nstates precisely at the edge of a chaotic behaviour.\nA question, indeed more interesting than the semantics\nof SOC, is whether the constraints in the model may be\nrelaxed to produce a 'hot' fluvial landscape more closely\nresembling an ordinary sandpile. This question is addressed in [5] and in more detatil in [9].\nOur main goal is twofold. On one hand we will extend\nprevious investigations both in accuracy and in statistics\nby performing simulations at much larger scales. On the\nother hand, we will consider important issues such as the\neffect of the boundaries and of the initial conditions bearing much significance on geologic influences. In particular\nwe will show that both the aforementioned effects play\nan important role in the results previously obtained. We\nalso study the effects of disorder, say through the presence of small, uncorrelated inhomogeneities in the initial\n\nII. THE MODEL\n\nWe consider a lattice model of a real landscape. Let\nhx be the height of the landscape associated to every site\nx of a square lattice of size L \u00d7 L. The lattice is tilted\nat an angle \u03b8 with respect to a given axis to mimic the\neffects of gravity. Two possibilities will be analyzed:\n1 All the sites on the lowest side (kept at height\nh = 0) are possible outlets (i.e. the multiple outlet arrangement) of an ensemble of rivers which are\ncompeting to drain the whole L \u00d7 L basin;\n2 Only one site is kept at h = 0 and it is the outlet\nof a single river in the L \u00d7 L basin.\nIn addition, for both the above cases, two types of\ninitial conditions will be considered: (a) a regular initial\nlandscape, e.g. flat, and (b) an irregular surface obtained\nby superposing to a smooth sloping surface a suitable\nnoise.\nEach site collects an unit amount of water from a distributed injection (here a constant rainfall rate as in the\noriginal approach) in addition to the flow which drains\ninto it from the upstream sites. A unit of water mass is\nassigned to each pixel of drainage area so that the total\narea drained into a site is also a measure of the total water mass collected at that site. From each site water flows\nto one of the eight sites, four nearest neighbors and four\nnext nearest neighbors, having the lowest height (i.e. the\nsteepest descent path). We shall indicate all these eight\nneighbouring sites as nearest-neighbours (nn). This construction allows the assignment of drainage directions to\nan arbitrary landscape. The drained area ax is associated\nto each site x according to the equation\nX\nay + 1\n(1)\nax =\ny(x)\n\nwhere the sum runs over the subset y(x) \u2208 nn(x) of\nneighbor sites whose area is actually drained by x. The\nsecond term in eq.(1) represents the uniform injection.\nAlso, the (up)stream-length lx from site x to the source\nis computed according to the following procedure. At\na given site x the areas of all nn(x) of that sites are\nchecked. Following the ordinary meaning of downstream\nand upstream sites (i.e. downstream is the site one finds\nfollowing the river to the outlet, upstream is the site following which one reach the source from which the largest\nincoming river enters the site.) Following Ref. [8], the nn\n2\n\n\fwith largest value leads to the outlet and is defined to\nbe a downstream site. The nn with the second largest\nvalue indicates the longest path toward the source and\nis defined to be the upstream site. The sum of all the\nupstream sites from site x to the source is lx . The downstream length could be defined through an analogou procedure. Experimental measures are available for both ax\nand lx [9].\nThe time evolution of the model follows the following\nsteps:\n\nModel B An inclined plane with all sites at the bottom of the plane allowed to be possible outlets.\nThis choice was selected with the aim of investigating the differences arising when arranging the\nboundary conditions with multiple outlets versus\nsingle outlet. The former allows for competition\nfor drainage area among rivers.\nModel C,D The two previously considered situations\nwith the addition of a random, uncorrelated noise\n(whose strenght - i.e. variance - is less than 10% of\nthe average height). That is, on top of the height\ncomputed according to the rules of model A and\nB respectively (a comb-like lattice and an inclined\nplane), we added a random Dh that is extracted in\nthe interval [\u2212 < h > /10, < h > /10] where < h >\nrepresents the mean altitude of the landscape.\n\n1 The shear stress \u03c4x acting at every site is computed\naccording to [15]\n\u221a\n\u03c4x = \u2206hx ax\n(2)\nwhere \u2206hx is the local gradient along the drainage\ndirection.\n\nAn average over a few (up to five) configurations was\ntaken. This choice, especially when coupled to large sizes\nof the system, proves sufficient for a statistical descriptions sought in view of the self-averaging nature of the\nrandom perturbation.\nIn Figure 1 typical landscapes sculpted by the above\ndynamical process and the corresponding networks\ndrawn through the steepest descent construction are\nshown for models A,B. The same picture for models C,D\nis shown in Figure 2.\nTwo features can be grasped from these pictures. First,\nin the results of both model A and B there is a strong\nmemory of the initial configuration despite the fact that\nthe dynamics of the erosion process was somewhat expected to be sufficiently strong to soon lose the imprinting of its initial condition. Secondly, the single outlet\nrestriction imposed in model A appears to be a severe\nconstraint because it increasingly affects the wandering\nof the main river towards the lowest part of the basin.\nOur results suggest that this is indeed the case for flat\ninitial conditions (A and B) while for noisy initial conditions boundary effects are of lesser importance.\n\n2 If the shear stress at a site exceeds a threshold\nvalue, \u03c4c , then the corresponding height hx is reduced (i.e. by erosion) in order to decrease the\nlocal gradient. The shear stress is set just at the\nthreshold value. This produces a rearrangement of\nthe network followed by a reupdating of the whole\npattern as in step 1.\n3 When all sites have shear stress below threshold\nthe system is in a dynamically steady state. Since\nthis situation is not necessarily the most stable, a\nperturbation is applied to the network with the aim\nof increasing the stability of a new steady state. A\nsite is thus chosen at random and its height is increased in such a way that no lakes, i.e. sites whose\nheight is lower than that of their eight neighbours,\nare formed. Steps 1 and 2 then follow as before.\nAfter a suitable number of the perturbations (step 3),\nthe system reaches a steady state which is unsensitive\nto further perturbations and where all statistics of the\nnetworks are stable. This resulting state is scale-free,\ni.e. it is characterized by power-law distributions of the\nphysical quantities of interest.\n\nB. Area and length exponents\n\nLet us define P (a, L) and \u03a0(l, L) as the exceedence (cumulative) probability distributions of the drainage area\na and stream length l respectively arising in a domain of\nlinear size L. The following scaling forms are expected\nto hold [8]:\n\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Landscape evolutions\n\nOur numerical calculations were carried out on a\nbidimensional square lattice (where each site has eight\nnearest-neighbours) for sizes up to L = 200 with reflecting boundary conditions in the direction transversal to\nthe flow and open boundary condition in the parallel one.\nWe considered the following initial conditions:\n\nP (a, L) = a1\u2212\u03c4 F (\n\na\nL1+H\n\n\u03a0(l, L) = l1\u2212\u03b3 G(\n\nModel A A comb-like structure with a single outlet\nThis was the situation originally studied in [15] and\nour results are in agreement with theirs.\n\nl\n)\nLdl\n\n)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nHere H is the Hurst exponent [6] and dl is the streamlength (or chemical distance) fractal exponent.\n3\n\n\fcomes from the fact that an extensively class of models known as Optimal Channel Network (OCN) models,\nassume this quantity is minimized by natural landscape\nevolution. By using this principle OCN describe evolution from random spanning graphs to network more\nsimilar to the real ones. It is interesting to note that in\nthis model where no hypothesis is made on E, we still\nobserve an almost monotonical decrease of E associated\nwith the dynamical evolutions, and a stabilization on different plateaus of values of E. The actual figures for a\nsample 30 are as follows: E starts from an initial value\nof 7600 and decreases towards a plateau of 6800 \u2212 6700\nwhere this monotonic decrease becomes slower (1% decrease in 50000 steps). This behavior, also observed in\nother models [28], bears important consequences in the\nlight of the suggested connection of fractality and optimality [5,25\u201327]\n\nAs it was already noted [8], for self-affine river networks\n(H < 1, dl = 1) the scaling relations relate all exponents\nin terms of H. For self-similar river networks (H = 1,\ndl > 1), the same happens in terms of dl .\nAnother important indicator of basin morphology is\nthe relation between the mean total contributing area a\nand the length of the main stream lmax \u221d Ldl [8,24],\nwhich is commonly known as Hack's law [22]:\n1/h\na \u221d lmax\n\u221d Ldl /h\n\n(5)\n\nThe related exponent has been studied in all simulations.\nA summary of the scaling relations between the various\nexponents involved is reported in Table I.\nExperimental values of \u03c4 and \u03b3 are available from earlier analyses of DTMs from basins of different size, geology, exposed lithology, climate and vegetation [1,24].\nIt was observed that, while a majority of basins tend\nto seemingly universal values \u03c4 = 1.43 \u00b1 0.02 and \u03b3 =\n1.8\u00b10.1, exceptions are observed where altered values are\nobserved although always in a concerted manner. Since it\nwas suggested [8] that scaling laws for river networks are\nrelated, e.g. \u03b3 = 1+(\u03c4 \u22121)/h, it was concluded there that\nno universal exponents are expected in nature. Rather,\nthe roles of geology and tectonics concert a coordinated\nscaling structure which strives for fractality yet adapted\nto its geological environment. The results of the model\ndescribed here, revisited in the above light, conform to\nthis view.\nThe results for the four models A,B,C and D for the\narea distributions are shown in Figure 3. It is apparent that, due to the pathological initial conditions, the\nscaling behaviour for models A and B is somewhat more\nnoisy than for models C and D. Figure 4 contains the\ncollapse plot for all the cases. Figure 5 shows the streamlength distribution for the four models. For this picture\nthe same remarks of Figure 3 apply. In Figure 6 we show\nthe collapse plot corresponding for the stream-length distributions.\nA summary of the scaling exponents obtained is included in Table II where we observe a consistent picture\nof related scaling exponents as theoretically expected see Table I.\n\nIV. GEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS AND\nQUENCHED RANDOM PINNING\n\nThis section presents a detailed study on the effects on\nlandcape evolution of quenched randomness, simulated\nby a random choice of sites unable to evolve regardless\nof the threshold value developed therein. It is found that\nthis form of disorder tends to favour aggregation patterns characterized by values of \u03c4 = 1.43 \u00b1 0.02 for both\nmodels, say, A and B (i.e. with single outlets or open\nboundary conditions). This results suggests that the origin of the recurrent values observed in nature could be\nrelated to the ubiquity of heterogeneity in surface properties characterizing locally the critical shear threshold.\nWithin the river basin morphological and geological\nconstraints play a definite role in the dynamical evolution of landforms. The effects of quenched constraints,\nsimulating any heterogeneity is the distribution of surficial properties affecting erosion properties, is to favour\nsome sites for the flowpaths, thus excluding other sites\nfrom the capture of the developing network which ultimately shapes the evolution process. In order to mimic\nsuch effects we analyzed the effect of a random pinning\nof a small region of the total surface (typically 5 \u2212 9%)\nwhere the evolution is frozen, that is, the height is pinned\nto its initial value. We find that this constraint tends to\nfavour aggregation even in the presence of random initial\nconditions.\nAs regards the effect of the pinning, figure 7 (on the\nleft) shows a sample whose dimension is 100 with multiple outlet and random initial noise (model D). Figure\n7 (on the right) shows the same configuration (evolved\nfrom the same initial conditions) but with a 5% dilution\npinning. It is evident that some of the smaller streams on\nthe left have increased their size thus leading to a bigger\naggregation.\nIn this case we found \u03c4 = 1.43\u00b10.02. Moreover, all the\nother exponents verify the correct scalings predicted in\n\nC. Energy Dissipation and Optimal Channel\nNetworks\n\nDuring the evolution of the landscape we also monitored the change P\nin total energy dissipation of the system,\ndefined as E = x a0.5\n(where x spans all sites of the\nx\nlattice) [25\u201327]. The reason of this name come from the\ncomputation at any site of the gravitational energy lost\nby the falling of the water. In any point x one can expect\na gravitational energy loss of the order of ax \u2206hx where\n\u2206hx represents the local gradient along the drainage direction. By using the observed scaling \u2206hx \u221d ax 0.5 one\nobtains the above formula. The interest in this quantity\n4\n\n\fFinally, we have found that quenched disorder, modeled by random pinning, has a profound effect on the\nrobustness of the resulting planar patterns by favouring aggregation and by locking the planar landforms into\nmodes quite similar to the ones observed in nature.\nThe remarkable success obtained by such a simple\nmodel in enlightnening some crucial features of the real\nbasins is promising for a future success in a general characterization of the dynamics of fractal growth.\n\nTable I. Purely for comparison purposes with the prevous\nresults, we also report the plot of the area distribution\nin Figure 8 on the left. We also found that model D\nreproduces the same results, i.e. \u03c4 = 1.43 \u00b1 0.04 and\n\u03b3 = 1.60 \u00b1 0.04. We are confident that this result at\nleast for model C is quite robust with respect to changes\nof the pinning dilution. In the case of a 9% dilution for\na smaller number of simulation we found quite similar\nresults \u03c4 = 1.44 \u00b1 0.05 and a cumulative plot of P (a\u2032 >\na, L) is shown on the right part of Fig.8 [29].\nThis result suggests that the origin of recurrent values\nobserved in nature could indeed be related to the ubiquity\nof geological and morphological constraints in the surface\nproperties locally characterizing the critical shear stress.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nEnlightening discussions with J. Banavar, F. Colaiori\nA. Flammini, A. Maritan, and A. Rinaldo are acknowledged. Suggestion by A. Giacometti have been particularly helpful.

Specifically, we analyzed the stability of the universality class of the original model with respect to the\ninitial conditions and to the change from single to multiple outlets. We found that if one starts with structured initial conditions, critical exponents are sensible\nto a change from single to multiple outlets. On the\nother hand, upon starting from disordered initial conditions, we found critical exponents belonging to a new\nclass which appears to be robust to the change from single to multiple outlet. Thus this simple model, under\ncontrolled conditions, yields somewhat different yet internally consistent scale-free fluvial landforms depending\non the dominant conditions affecting evolution.\nThe above results conform to the experimental observation [8] suggesting that the relevant scaling exponents\nfor river networks are not universal. Rather, the fractal nature of river networks adjusts to the constraints\nimposed by the geological environment in a coordinated\nmanner. It is interesting to observe that the final state\nof all simulation yields indeed fractal structures, as observed in nature, though characterized by different aggregation properties. The exponents characaterizing these\ndifferent aggregates, nevertheless follow in a rather good\nagreement the scaling relations shown in Table I.\nWe suggest that the lack of robustness in the value of\nthe scaling exponents with respect to boundary and initial conditions is related to the non-local character of the\nshear-based threshold, differently from what is observed\nin classical sandpile models of self-organized criticality\n[20]. The intrinsic interest of the different aggregation\nproperties of the steady states of the dynamics is related\nto their optimality with respect of total energy dissipation [15]. In fact, depending on external conditions,\nthe same dynamical process may indeed get trapped in\nsteady state configurations yielding local minima of the\ntotal energy dissipation functional, in what we may define as a feasible optimality process [5].\n\n[1] I.
