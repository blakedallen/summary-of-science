(2006), traditional bibliographic data bases like PASCAL evolved\nfrom a small specialized bibliography to a digital library covering most of scientific fields. The\ncollection is maintained with massive human effort. On the long term this investment is only justified\nif data quality remains much higher than that of the search engine style collections. In this paper we\nshow that co-author and terminological graphs of high quality can be very easily extracted from\nPASCAL database, visualized and browsed. In particular, we founded out that special problems of\nperson names can be managed using simple heuristics. Moreover, we show that is possible and useful\nto display the complete coauthor graph of several hundreds of PASCAL abstracts resulting from a\nrequest. This differs from Klink et al. (2004)'s approach that focus on local extracts of the graphs to\ncomprehend only the surroundings of a single author on DBLP database.\nWe focus on valued graph of terms (words, names or key-words) that constitute the input to co-word\nanalysis as defined in (Michelet, 1988). It has been observed by Courtial (1990) that in this type of\nanalysis applied to scientific and technical databases, short paths of strong associations can reveal\npotential new connections between separated fragments of the network and reveal innovative\nsituations.\nFollowing these observations, graph clustering methods that do not focus on homogeneous clusters,\nbut highlight some heterogeneous clusters formed along a path of strong associations have been\nproposed. The problem of graph clustering is well studied in a large literature. We refer to Flake et al.\n(2004) for a complete review. The best known graph clustering algorithms attempt to optimize specific\ncriteria such as k-median, minimum sum, minimum diameter, etc., meanwhile simple fast variants of\nsingle link clustering (SLC) give satisfactory results in Courtial (1990)'s approach of co-word analysis.\nOne of these variants can be found in the SDOC system (Polanco et al. 1995) actually integrated to\nSTANALYST (http://stanalyst.inist.fr/) on-line interface that gives access to the PASCAL and\n480\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nFRANCIS databases (http://www.inist.fr) for information analysis purposes. It uses a threshold to fix\nthe maximal cardinality of clusters. One of the most important qualities of SDOC is to present the\ncontent of clusters as subgraphs of associations that can be analyzed in a very intuitive way that\nminimizes the risk of observing correlations where they do not exists.\nIn this paper we revisit this main idea of co-word analysis applied to two other types of graphs\nextracted from bibliometric data: 1) the graph of all associations between authors, 2) the graph of\nstrong associations between authors and terms automatically extracted from abstracts and grouped\nusing linguistic variations. We adapt for this purpose the TermWatch system that comprises three\nmain modules: a term extractor, a relation identifier which yields the terminological network and a\nclustering module. The results are output on two interfaces: a graphic one mapping the clusters in a 2D\nspace and a terminological hypertext network allowing the user to interactively explore results, return\nto source texts or re-execute the system's modules.\nYet, based on the interactive graph visualisation toolkit (AiSee, http://www.aisee.com) and a different\nclustering algorithm called CPCL introduced in (Ibekwe-SanJuan 1995) and implemented in\nTermWatch (SanJuan 2005), we show how to reduce and explore informative paths between nodes.\nThe article is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a precise description of our methodology\nwhich involves the definition of our text data representation \u00a72.1, the graphs we extract from this data\n(\u00a72.2 to \u00a72.4) and the way we mine informative short paths \u00a72.5 using a simple clustering algorithm.\nIn \u00a73 we carry out an experimentation of our approach on a small and a medium size corpus (the\nwhole extracted graph feats in RAM memory). We process to the clustering of this non SWG in \u00a73.3.\n\u00a74 is devoted to discussion and future work.\n\n2.\n\nGraph extraction from documents\n\n2.1.\n\nAssociation graphs\n\nWe carry out the usual extraction of co-author and co-terms association graph from the collection of\nseparate documents. From a formal point of view, the input is a hypergraph (a finite family H={h1,h2,\n...} of finite subsets called edges) having as many hyper-edges as documents. Each hyper-edge hi is a\nset of units extracted from a document i. hi can contain authors, terms, bibliometric attributes etc.\nFrom H_D, we derive the valued graph of associations G=(V,E,a) where:\n\u2022 V is the set union of all extracted items.\n\u2022 E is the family of all pairs (dyads or edges) of elements included in hyper-edges (for any edge e in E,\ne is of the form {u,v} and there exists an edge di containing both u and v).\n\u2022 a is a valuation of E. In this experimentation we chose the equivalence coefficient which is defined\nfor any edge e={u,v} as the product of conditional probabilities of finding one of the vertex in an\nhyper-edge knowing the presence of the other.\n\n2.2.\n\nReducing and Visualizing Association Graphs\n\nUsually, when a co-occurrence is used, a threshold is set on the keyword frequency in order to obtain a\nless sparse matrix (Feldman et al., 1998). In our approach we prefer to set the threshold on association\nindex after observing that low frequency items from PASCAL can represent valuable prospective rare\ninformation without inducing too much noise. Consequently, every value s in ]0,1[ induces a subgraph Gs=(V,Es,a) where Es is the set of pairs of vertices {i,j} such that a(i,j)> s.\nWe use a variant of the single link clustering (SLC), called CPCL, originally introduced in IbekweSanJuan (1998) and described hereafter, to form clusters of keywords related by geodesic paths made\nof relatively high associations. However, any variant of SLC that reduces its chain effect can produce\ninteresting results in this context. In this experiment we use CPCL instead of SDOC because it does\nnot require fixing the maximal size of a cluster, and relations between extracted clusters are\n\n481\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nsymmetric. For all these reasons, CPCL is better adapted to the task of valuate graph reduction while\npreserving its structure. We use two types of interfaces to browse the resulting clustered network.\nThe interactive graph visualization interface AiSee (http://www.aisee.com) is based on minimization\nenergy models. It displays the graph on the form of a set of masses related by spiral springs,\nrepresented by straight edges. Vertices represent units that can be interactively folded or clusters that\ncan be unfolded to observe their internal structure and their external links to surround clusters or\nexternal items. Since clusters are labeled by their central terms, this interface reveals units (authors or\nterms) with high scores of betweenness centrality. Moreover, by opening the clusters the user visualize\nthe geodesic paths of strong associations that cross the label of the cluster. These short paths reveal\npotential new interactions between document attributes.\nIn the case of very large graphs, like graphs including author's terminology as explained hereafter, a\nsupplementary hypertext browsing interface is required to retrieve and explore informative\nassociations. We used the navigator interface included in the TermWatch system to check details of\nassociation between authors and automatic extracted terms from raw text.\n\n2.3.\n\nClustering Algorithm\n\nThere exist many graph clustering algorithms. In particular, Matsuda et al. (1999) proposed algorithms\nextracting high density subsets of vertices that could be apply to the values of graph G, but not to Gs\ngraphs of textual data that are especially sparse. We chose the CPCL (Classification by Preferential\nClustered Link) algorithm that tends to form clusters along short geodesic paths of strong associations.\nIt consists in merging iteratively clusters of keywords related by an association strongest than any\nother in the external neighborhood. In other words, it works on local maximal edges instead of\nabsolute maximal values like in standard SLC. We briefly recall this algorithm hereafter and we refer\nthe reader to (Berry et al. 2004) for a detailed description in the graph formalism.\nProgram CPCL(V,E,a)\n1) Compute the set S of edges {i,j} such that\na(i,j) is greater than s(i,z)\nand s(j,z) for any vertex z,\n2) Compute the set C of connected components of the sub-graph (V, S).\n3) Compute the reduced valued graph (C, E_C, a_C)\nwhere E_C is the set of pairs of components {I,J}\nsuch that:\nthere exists {i,j} in E with i in J, j in J\nand a_C(I,J) = max{a(i,j): i in I, j in J}.\nIf V <> C go to phase 1 else return (C, E_C, a_C)\n\n2.4.\n\nTerm extraction for topic mapping\n\nTermwatch performs multi-word term extraction based on shallow NLP, using the LTPOS tagger and\nLTChunker software (C) Andrei Mikheev 2000 of the University of Edinburgh. LTPOS is a\nprobabilistic part-of-speech tagger based on Hidden Markov Models. LTChunk identifies simplex\nnoun phrases (Nps), i.e., NPs without prepositional attachments. In order to extract more complex\nterms, contextual rules are used to identify complex terminological Nps.\nTerms undergo variations which lead to the creation of new neighboring concepts. This process, called\nvariation in the computational terminology field has been well studied (Ibekwe 1998). Variations\noccur at different linguistic levels: morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic. TermWatch identifies\nthe different variants of the same term going from close semantic variants like morphological (gender\n\n482\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nand spelling), synonyms (using WordNet) to generic-specific relations using syntactic criteria\n(expansions and structural changes).\nThen given a collection D={d1,...,dn} of documents, we consider the following hyper graph\nT={t1,...,tn} where each hyper edge ti contains all author names of document di with all terms\nextracted in document di and all their variants founded in the corpus of documents.\nFrom this hyper-graph we derive an association graph G=(V,E,f) as explained in subsection 2.1 but\nwith a different valuation function f. Indeed we set for each edge (u,v) to:\n\u2022 1 if u and v are terms and u is a variant of v,\n\u2022 a(u,v) otherwise.\nThe graph Gs for s=0.8 is then clustered using CPCL and visualized in AiSee while we use the\nhypertext TermWatch interface to browse all association links between clustered elements as we\nalready explained.\n\n2.5. The station of analysis STANALYST\u00ae\nThe station of analysis STANALYST\u00ae is composed of a whole of modules allowing the search for\ninformation in the bibliographical data bases of the INIST, for their statistical, terminological and\nthematic analysis (Polanco et al. 2001).\nThe integration of these various modules within a common, accessible graphic user interface since a\nnavigator HTTP is as follows: the RECEPTION is a static page HTML giving access to the\napplication; the user declares his name and defines his password. The PROJECT makes it possible to\ndefine an environment of work, i.e. a repertory in which will be stored all the results concerning the\nproject. The user is the owner and it also has the possibility of giving access to its project to the\nassociated users.\nModules CORPUS, BIBLIOMETRICS, INDEXING and INFORMETRICS constitute the modules of\nwork of this station of analysis of information. The module CORPUS manages the creation of corpus\nby execution of requests built by the user. The corpora can then be exported bound for the following\nmodules. Module BIBLIOMETRICS manages the creation of descriptive statistical analyses. The\nmodule INDEXING makes it possible either to revise the indexing or to carry out an automatic\nindexing of the corpus, resting for that in tools allowing a terminological extraction on the basis of\nseveral terminological references. The result of the INDEXING module will be the input for\nclassification set of themes. The module INFORMETRICS manages classification using nonsupervised automatic classification methods: two programs are available. The first realizes a hierarchic\nclassification based on the co-word analysis method and the second one applies the K-means axial\nmethod to obtain a non-hierarchical classification.\nThe modules use a whole of repertories of work containing the programs, scripts, parameters\nnecessary to its operation, as well as the whole of the projects created by the users.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\n3.1.\n\nCorpus extracted from PASCAL database\n\nWe extracted two experimental corpora from PASCAL database. A corpus on South-America nanotechnologies that we shall refer by SAN for short, and a corpus on chordal graphs that we shall refer\nby CG.\nThe SAN corpus is constituted by 939 bibliographic references coming from PASCAL database. The\nquery asks for scientific and technical papers related to nanotechnologies, published in the twelve last\nyears (1994 to nowadays) and having at least one author affiliated to a South-American organization.\nThe principal scientific domains covered by the corpus references are Physics with 68% of the\nreferences, Engineering Sciences with 16% and Chemistry with 11%. 85% of the bibliographic\nreferences have been published in the 6 last years. Almost all the documents (99.7%) are in English\nlanguage. The 2,574 authors come from 1,984 affiliations located in 51 different countries. The five\n483\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nbest represented are Brazil, USA, Argentina, France and Spain with, respectively, 40%, 12%, 9%, 6%\nand 4% of documents. The documents come from 180 journals published in 11 different countries.\nThe three first are USA, The Netherlands and United Kingdom with, respectively, 35%, 31% and 16%\nof documents. The 4 journals the most represented (2% of the cover) produce 23% of the references\nand 75% of them are produced by 28% of the cover.\nThe CG corpus is composed by 155 bibliographic references coming from PASCAL database. The\nquery asks for scientific papers dealing with chordal graphs and explores 22 years of PASCAL\ndatabase. The principal scientific domains covered by the corpus references are Mathematics (56%)\nand Engineering Sciences (43%). 67% of the bibliographic references have been published in the 6 last\nyears. All the documents are in English. The 261 authors come from 240 affiliations situated in 32\ndifferent countries. USA, Canada, France, Germany and Taiwan with, respectively, 27%, 10%, 9%,\n9% and 4% of documents are the best represented. The documents come from 29 journals published in\n8 different countries. The Netherlands, Germany and USA with, respectively, 57%, 29% and 29% are\nthe first ones. 25% of the references are produced by only one journal and the five first journals\nproduce 75% of the cover.\n\n3.2.\n\nCo-Author graphs\n\nWe generated two level visualizations of author graphs. First level is the whole graph of associations\nbetween authors, thus all pairs of authors that wrote at least one paper together are represented. For\nsets with less than 300 documents this graph can be browsed using an appropriate toolkit like AiSee as\nshown in Fig. 1 (left side) for the SAN corpus and Fig 3 for the corpus on chordal graph.\nFig 1. Co-author graph extracted from corpus SAN. Left figure shows the general shape of the\ngraph. Vertices represent authors. Neighboring authors in the same cluster share the same color.\nRight figure shows the contents of clusters Knobel and Souza.\n\nIn the case of SAN corpus, co-author graph reveals a set of clusters representing international\nimportant collaborations of South-American academic institutions. It is possible to observe in cluster\n\n484\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nJ. Jiang a great number of exchanges with Japan and in cluster M. S. Dresselhaus a strong\ncollaboration with USA. Some authors have a central position as M. Knobel, A. F. Craievich, P. C.\nMorais, A. G. Souza or D. Ugarte, respectively in clusters M. Knobel, A. F. Craievich, P. C. Morais,\nA. G. Souza and J. Jiang. These authors come from internationally known academic institutes. It is\nalso possible to find author cliques: an interesting example can be observed in cluster P. Levy, whose\nauthors are related to a national atomic energy institute.\nFig. 2 Reduced co-author graph on SAN. Vertex represent clusters labeled by their author having the\nhighest number of links towards other clusters.\n\nClustering allows to highlight an underlying structure as shown in Fig 2 for the SAN corpus and\n\n485\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nauthors that relate different groups as shown in Fig. 1 (right side).\nIn the case of CG corpus, co-author graph reveals a central author (cutting vertex): Dieter Kratsh and a\ndense cluster (unfolded in the figure) formed around Heggernes and Berry who is related to all authors\nFig. 3 Co-author graph extracted from CG corpus. Clusters are wrapped together.\n\nin this cluster. Another feature of this image is to show the evolution of authors Berry and Paul since\ntheir PhD with Bordat and Habib respectively.\n\n486\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\n3.3.\n\nTerminology Author graphs\n\nWe proceed to a term extraction in both corpora. The resulting graphs are huge and a hypertext\nbrowsing interface is required. However, in the case of GC corpus, graph display confirms the central\nposition of Dieter Kratsch in this corpus since a cluster labeled by his name appears. By unfolding it,\nwe see the terminology used in his publications.\nFig. 4 Cluster labeled Kratsch and associations to cluster of open questions\n\nFig. 5 Contents of cluster k log in GC graph.\n\n487\n\n\fCOLLNET 2006\n\nFig 4 and 5 show features that is difficult to detect using the sole hypertext browsing interface. In the\ncase of CG corpus, if the centrality of author Krastch is revealed by the fact that this name is the label\nof the biggest cluster, the graph display interface allows to point out the multiple links between terms\nassociated to open questions and terms by folding the huge cluster labeled Krastch and unfolding the\ncluster labeled open question. By unfolding the two clusters of terminology respectively related to\nauthors Simonet and Berry, that graphical interface allows pointing out the multiple graph problems\ntargeted by Berry, meanwhile Simonet appears to be more specialized in a single application of these\nalgorithms.\nThe terminology-author graph obtained from SAN corpus allows to confirm same statements made\nfrom the co-author graph exploitation. By example, it is possible to validate the central position of A.\nCraeivich and determine the terminology associated by examining the cluster contents: doped film,\ngrazing-incidence small angle X-ray reflectivity, GISAXS pattern, film surface.\nThe cluster K. D. Machado presents the same clique of authors observed in the co-author graph (J. C.\nde Lima, T. A. Grandi, C. E. M. Campos and K. D. Machado) and the association with two others\nclusters: P. S. Pizani and binary mixture. The cluster binary mixture is composed by: hexagonal Co Se,\nnominal composition Co, amorphous selenium.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRelying on the data quality of PASCAL database, we have designed and experimented an interface\nthat can extract and efficiently display in real time the co-author and terminology network from\ndocuments issued by a user query through the STANALYST system. Further human computer\ninterface study shall allow us to better adapt this interface to non AiSee's users by automatically\nselecting clusters to fold or unfold for different scientific watch tasks. Moreover, in our experiment we\ndid not use the key-word field of PASCAL abstracts since we focused on the feasibility of displaying\nthe vocabulary used in text abstracts. Another further experiment will be to add this data to the\nhypergraph representation of documents.\n\nReferences\n1. Berry A., Kaba B., Nadif M., SanJuan E., Sigayret A.
