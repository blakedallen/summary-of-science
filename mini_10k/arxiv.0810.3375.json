ITRODUCTION\nAs a physicist who is mainly interested in the teaching of physics, I am working in a building which\nalso accomodates a distinguished department of meteorology. It is near at hand, that I began to become\ninterested in the physics of the atmosphere. Sometimes, however, I got into trouble when trying to\nunderstand my collegues from the other department.\nObviouly, what they explained to me was consistent.\nNevertheless, I often felt unable to translate what I\nhad learnt from them into my own language. This is\na natural phenomenon. Whenever two disciplines\ndevelop rather independently it happens that one\nand the same process or subject will be described\nwith distinct models and different words.1 With this\narticle, I shall try to translate some of what I learnt\nfrom the meteorologists into a language which is\nmore familiar to the physicist. In particular, I shall\nshow that several phenomena in the atmosphere can\nbe described as a process of establishing or of perturbing an equilibrium. The atmosphere is a peerless\nplaying ground if one is interested in discussing all\nthe facets of the concept of equilibrium. In my discussion, combined equilibria will play a particular\nrole: equilibria of a type which is known by solid\nstate physicists or physical chemists in the form of\nthe electro-chemical equilibrium.\nIn section II we shall remember some basic concepts related to the establishment of equilibria. In\n\nsection III examples of combinations of two potentials will be discussed. First we remember the\nelectro-chemical potential and then we shall introduce a gravito-chemical potential. In section IV a\n\"triple\" potential will be considered: the gravitothermo-chemical potential. This potential is the central concept of the article. Section V contains conclusions.\nIn this article we shall make the following simplifications:\n1) We limit ourselves to the lower 10 km of the atmosphere, i. e., the troposphere.\n2) We do not consider phase transitions, i. e., we\nonly discuss the dry atmosphere.\n3) We only consider atmospheres with a homogeneous composition, a condition which is realized\nwithin a good approximation in the troposphere of\nthe earth.\n4) Our most far-reaching restriction consists in the\nfact, that we assume that the values of all local\nquantities only vary in the vertical direction, or zdirection.\nThe symbols of physical quantities employed in this\narticle have the following meaning:\nE = energy\n\u03c3 = entropy produced per time and per volume\np = pressure\n\n\f6\n\nV = volume\nT = temperature\nS = entropy\nR = gas constant\ncp = molar specific heat at constant pressure\n\u03c8 = gravitational potential\nm = mass\ng = acceleration of gravity\n\u03bc = chemical potential\nn = amount of substance\n\u03c6 = electric potential\nQ = electric charge\nCurrent densities are named jX, where X is the flowing quantity. Thus, jQ is the electric current density,\njS the entropy current density etc.\nWe need several \"molar\" quantities, i. e., extensive\nquantities divided by the amount of substance. We\nshall characterize them by a hat above the symbol of\nthe extensive quantity. Thus, \u015c is the molar entropy,\nm\u0302 the molar mass etc.\nWe shall need several relationships from standard\ntextbooks of thermodynamics:\n1) The gravitational potential as a function of the\nheight z for distances from the earth's surface which\nare small compared to the radius of the earth:\n\u03c8(z) = g * z\n(1)\n2) The thermal equation of state of the ideal gas:\nRT\nV\u0302 =\n(2)\np\n3) The molar entropy as a function of pressure and\ntemperature for an ideal gas2:\np\nT\n\u015c( p,T ) = R ln 0 + c p ln + \u015c( p0 ,T0 )\n(3)\np\nT0\n4) The chemical potential as a function of pressure\nand temperature for an ideal gas2:\np\nT\n\u03bc ( p,T ) = RT ln \u2212 c pT ln\np0\nT0\n\n(\n\n)\n\n+ c p \u2212 \u015c( p0 ,T0 ) (T \u2212 T0 ) + \u03bc ( p0 ,T0 ) (4)\nIn equations (3) and (4), \u015c( p0 ,T0 ) is the molar entropy for an arbitrary reference pressure p0 and an\narbitrary reference temperature T0, and \u03bc(p0, T0) is\nthe chemical potential for the same values of pressure and temperature.\nThe following numerical values will be needed:\n\ng = 9.81 N kg\u20131\nR = 8.3144 J mol\u20131 K\u20131\nm\u0302 = 0.029 kg mol\u20131 (for dry air)\ncp = 29.1 J mol\u20131 K\u20131 (for dry air)\n\u015c = 198,7 J mol\u20131 K\u20131 (for dry air at a temperature\nof 298 K and a pressure of 1 bar)\nII. DRIVING FORCES AND EQUILIBRIA\nThe Gibbs fundamental relation (or Gibbs fundamental form)\n\ndE = \u2211 \u03bei dXi\ni\n3,4 tells us that a system can\nof thermodynamics\nchange its energy in several ways. The number of\nterms is equal to the number of degrees of freedom\nof the system. In the couples of \"energy-conjugated\"\nvariables at the right hand side of the equation, the\nfirst quantity, \u03bei, is, in general, an intensive quantity\nand the second one, Xi, an extensive quantity. Within\nthe framework of thermodynamics one often considers systems whose Gibbs fundamental relation\nreads\ndE = TdS \u2013 pdV + \u03a3\u03bcidni\n(5)\nThe equation means, that the system under consideration, a gas for instance, can exchange energy in\nthe following ways: in the form of heat TdS, by realizing work \u2013pdV or as chemical energy \u03bcidni. If the\nsystem is composed of only one substance and does\nnot change its composition or phase, equation (5)\nsimplifies to:\ndE = TdS \u2013 pdV + \u03bcdn.\nFor other systems the Gibbs fundametal relation can\ncontain many other terms of very distinct nature.5\nThe system which has the following Gibbs fundamental relation\ndE = TdS + \u03bcdn + \u03c6dQ + \u03c8dm\ncan exchange energy in the following forms: as\nheat, as chemical energy, as electric energy and as\ngravitational energy.\nTo each of the extensive quantities Xi, with the exception of the volume, corresponds a current with\nthe current density j Xi . If the current is flowing\nthrough a \"dissipator\" or \"resistor\", i. e., if the current causes the production of entropy, the corresponding intensive quantity has different values at\nboth ends of the dissipator. The energy dissipation\nrate per volume is6:\n\n\f7\n\nT \u03c3 = \u2212 \u2211 j Xi \u22c5 grad\u03bei\n\n(6)\n\ni\n\nHere, \u03c3 is the entropy production rate per volume.\nThe expression on the right hand side of equation\n(6) is sometimes called the dissipation function. The\ngradient of \u03bei can be interpreted as a driving force of\nthe current j Xi . We first consider examples where\nonly one single driving force is non-zero.\n\nThermal equilibrium is defined in an analogous\nway: In the state of thermal equilibrium we have\ngrad T(z) = 0\nor\nT(z) = const\nand in the state of gravitational equilibrium there is\n\nImagine an isolated electric conductor in an initial\nstate in which the electric potential varies from\npoint to point. Equation (6) now reads\n\ngrad \u03c8(z) = 0\n\nT\u03c3 = \u2013 jQ * grad \u03c6,\n\nThere are other equilibria but these don't play a part\nin our considerations about the atmosphere.8\n\nand the electric charge will redistribute until\ngrad \u03c6(z) = 0\nor\n\u03c6(z) = const.\nThis final state is a state of electric equilibrium.\nAnother example is a horizontal pipe which is provided with flow resistances and filled with air. The\nair is given an arbitrary initial pressure \"profile\"\nover the length of the pipe. According to equation\n(4) the chemical potential is also a function of the\nhorizontal coordinate. Thus, there is a chemical potential gradient which causes a dissipative substance\ncurrent, i. e., a redistribution of n until\ngrad (z) = 0\nor\n\u03bc(z) = const.\nThis final state is a state of chemical equilibrium.7\nOne might be inclined to interpret the concentration\ngradient as the driving force of the substance current, instead of the chemical potential gradient. In\norder to see that this is not appropriate consider a\nsubstance current in an inhomogeneous medium or\n\"background\". Imagine for instance, a bottle halffilled with water and the remaining volume containing carbon dioxide. At the beginning, the chemical\npotential of the CO2 dissolved in the water is lower\nthan that of the gaseous carbon dioxide. As a consequence, CO2 will diffuse from the gaseous phase\ninto the water. (The process can be accelerated by\nshaking.) At the end, \u03bc(CO2) has the same value\neverywhere, although the concentration in the solute\nphase remains lower than in the gaseous phase. Another example is well-known to every solid state\nphysicist: The chemical potential of electrons depends on the conductor material.\n\nor\n\u03c8(z) = const.\n\nIII. TWO COMBINED DRIVING FORCES\nAND THE RESULTING EQUILIBRIA\nA. The electro-chemical equlibrium\nOften one extensive quantity is coupled more or less\ntightly to another one. In general, this coupling is\ndescribed by the phenomenological coefficients of\nOnsager's theory. Since we restrict our discussion to\nthe special case of a completely tight coupling, we\ncan do without this theory.\nAs a first example, let us consider the familiar case\nof electrons in a solid. For electrons, mass m and\namount of substance n are tightly coupled. Moreover, there is a tight coupling between mass and electric charge Q, and therefore, also between amount of\nsubstance and electric charge. On the contrary, the\ncoupling between entropy and the other extensive\nquantities is very loose. In the case of a tight coupling, the equilibrium takes upon a new character.\nLet us assume, that always T(z) = const and \u03c8(z) =\nconst. These conditions are easy to meet. If the electrons are flowing in a conductor of constant temperature, the temperature of the electrons is also\nindependent of the position. The gravitational potential does not play a part anyway because of the\nweakness of the gravitational field.\nElectric charge and amount of substance are coupled\nvia the molar charge (an integer multiple of the\nFaraday constant):\nQ = Q\u0302 * n\nA similar relationship holds for the current densities\njQ and jn:\njQ = Q\u0302 * jn\n\n(7)\n\n\f8\n\nEquation (6) now becomes:\nT\u03c3 = \u2013 jQ * grad \u03c6 \u2013 jn * grad \u03bc .\nWith (7) we get\nT\u03c3 = \u2013 jn * ( Q\u0302 * grad \u03c6 + grad \u03bc)\nThe dissipation ceases, i. e., there is equilibrium,\nwhen\n\nQ\u0302 * grad \u03c6 + grad \u03bc = 0\nBecause of the coupling between Q and n, an equilibrium corresponding to only one of the exchange\nquantities Q and n cannot establish. Establishing the\nequlibrium for one of these quantities would in general cause a state of non-equilibrium for the other.\nSince Q\u0302 is independent of the position, the last\nequation simplifies to\ngrad ( Q\u0302 * \u03c6 + \u03bc) = 0\nand we can define a new, combined potential, the\nelectro-chemical potential:5,9\n\u03b7 = Q\u0302 * \u03c6 + \u03bc\nA gradient of the electro-chemical potential acts as\nthe net driving force for the couple [Q; n] of extensive quantities. In the case of electro-chemical equilibrium we have\ngrad \u03b7(z) = 0\nor\n\u03b7(z) = const.\nAn example for a situation in which the electrochemical potential is constant, although the electric\nand the chemical potential taken separately are not\nconstant, is the p-n-junction in equilibrium, familiar\nto every semiconductor physicist. A chemical potential gradient tries to pull the electrons from the n- to\nthe p-region, whereas the electric potential gradient\ntries to pull in the opposite direction.\nB. The gravito-chemical equilibrium\nAnother important combined equilibrium is one\nwhich we propose to call the gravito-chemical equilibrium. Consider the air in the gravitational field of\nthe earth. We first assume the atmosphere to be \"isothermal\", i. e., the temperature is independent of the\nheight z:\nT(z) = const.\n\nIn this case, two potential gradients are pulling at\nthe air: the chemical potential gradient is pulling in\nthe direction of decreasing pressure, i. e. upwards,\nthe gravitational potential gradient is pulling downwards. Here too, both pertinent extensive quantities\nare tighly coupled:\nm = m\u0302 * n\nThe corresponding currents are related by the same\nfactor:\njm = m\u0302 * jn .\nIn this case equation (6) reads:\nT\u03c3 = \u2013 jn * ( m\u0302 * grad \u03c8 + grad \u03bc)\nand the condition for equilibrium is:\n\nm\u0302 * grad \u03c8 + grad \u03bc = 0.\nSince m\u0302 is independent of the position this simplifies to\ngrad ( m\u0302 * \u03c8 + \u03bc) = 0.\nAgain, there will be no equilibrium regarding one\nsingle extensive quantity and it is appropriate to define a new, combined potential, the gravito-chemical\npotential:\n\u03b3 = m\u0302 * \u03c8 + \u03bc.\n(8)\nA gradient of the gravito-chemical potential acts as\nthe net driving force for the couple [m; n] of extensive quantities. In the case of gravito-chemical equilibrium we have:\ngrad \u03b3(z) = 0\nor\n\u03b3(z) = const.\n\n(9)\n\nWith (1) and with (8), equation (9) transforms into\n\u03bc(z) + g * m\u0302 * z = const\nor\n\u03bc(z) \u2013 \u03bc(0) = \u2013 g * m\u0302 * z.\n\n(10)\n\nThus, the chemical potential decreases linearly with\nthe height z. This is true for every fluid. Choosing\nthe origin of the chemical potential such that\n\u03bc(0) = 0 and putting for g and m\u0302 the numerical values, we get\n0.28J\n\u03bc (z) = \u2013\n\u22c5 z.\nm \u22c5 mol\nIf in equation (10) we insert the \u03bc-p-relationship of\nthe ideal gas (equation (4) with T = T0) we get the\n\n\f9\n\nz (km)\n\n10 z (km)\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nm\u02c6 !

We had supposed that there is never a deviation from thermal\nequilibrium.\n\namount of substance (and mass) are tightly coupled.\nUnder these circumstances the gas suffers the effect\nof three driving forces: the gradients of the gravitational potential, the temperature and the chemical\npotential.\nSince both, the mass and the entropy, are tightly\ncoupled to the amount of substance, we have\nm = m\u0302 * n\nand\nS = \u015c * n\nThis implies for the current densities\njm = m\u0302 * jn\nand\njS = \u015c * jn,\n\nIV. THREE DRIVING FORCES\n\nand equation (6) reads now\n\nA. The hydrostatic equilibrium\n\nT\u03c3 = \u2013 jn * ( m\u0302 * grad \u03c8 + \u015c * grad T + grad \u03bc).\n\nIn the preceding section we have admitted that the\ntemperature over the height is constant, i. e., there is\nthermal equilibrium at the beginning, and the gas\nremains in thermal equilibrium even though the\npressure is changing with time. In order to fulfill\nthis condition, the gas should be a good thermal\nconductor. As a matter of fact, this assumption is\ncompletely unrealistic. The thermal conductivity of\nthe air is so poor that just the opposite turns out\nmuch more reasonable: the thermal conductivity of\nthe air is zero or, in other words, entropy and\n\nAgain, there is no equilibrium regarding one single\nextensive quantity. The dissipation ceases, i. e. there\nis equilibrium, when\n\nm\u0302 * grad \u03c8 + \u015c * grad T + grad \u03bc = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nTransforming equation (11) we shall meet an \"old\nfriend\". As mentioned in the introduction we shall\nsuppose that our field variables only change in the\nvertical, i. e. z-direction. Hence, the gradient can be\nsubstituted by the derivative \u2202/\u2202z. In equation (11)\n\n\f10\n\nwe replace \u03c8 with the aid of (1), \u015c by means of\nequation (3) and \u03bc with (4) and we get\n\u2202p\ngm\u0302 +\nV\u0302 = 0\n\u2202z\nWith the thermal equation of state of the ideal gas\n(2) we finally can write\n\u2202p\n\u03c1\u22c5g +\n=0,\n(12)\n\u2202z\nthe familiar equation for hydrostatic equilibrium.\nThe surprise is not the result, but the way in which it\nwas obtained. Indeed, we see, that the equilibrium\nstate of the atmosphere which we just have discussed can not only be considered as a state of a\nmechanical equilibrium of forces, but also as a state\nin which the chemical, the thermal and the gravitational driving forces add to zero. For the moment\nthis statement seems to be no more than a gimmick.\nIn the following section, however, it will get some\nmore importance.\nWe conclude that if an arbitrary pressure profile and\nan arbitrary temperature profile are applied to a gas\nand the gas is left to itself, a well-defined pressure\nprofile and a well-defined temperature profile will\nestablish. These profiles are the result of the common action of the gravito-chemical and the thermal\npotential gradients. In general, in such an equilibrium state non of these potentials is constant,\ni. e.independent of z.\nB. The gravito-thermo-chemical equilibrium\nLet us now have a closer look at equation (11). The\nrelation suggests to define a \"triple\" potential:\n\u03b5 = \u03c8 * m\u0302 + T * \u015c + \u03bc\n(13)\nUnfortunately, \u03b5 cannot yet play the role of a driving\nforce, as we shall recognize immediately. We made\nthe assumption that the coupling between entropy\nand amount of substance is tight. However, we did\nnot exclude, that the value of \u015c is a function of the\nposition z. Therefore, for the gradient of \u03b5 we get\n\nis identical with the equilibrium condition (11) if the\nmolar entropy \u015c is independent of z, i. e. if\n\u015c(z) = const .\n(14)\nAn atmosphere for which this relation holds is\ncalled an adiabatic atmosphere. Actually, there is a\nsimple means to fulfill this condition. The atmosphere has to be intermixed, and that happens always\nwhen turbulent currents are present. Indeed, for the\nwell-mixed atmosphere the gradient of the potential\n\u03b5(z) defined by equation (13) is the pertinent driving\nforce. We call \u03b5(z) the gravito-thermo-chemical potential or GTC potential. The equilibrium for which\n\u03b5(z) = const\nor\ngrad \u03b5(z) = 0\nis the gravito-thermo-chemical equilibrium.\nIf (14) is fulfilled, equation (3) provides a relation\nbetween pressure and temperature:\n\nR ln\n\np\nT\n= c p ln\np0\nT0\n\nwhich is one of the familiar adiabatic equations.10\nCombining (4) and (15) we get the chemical potential as a function of the temperature:\n\u03bc (T ) \u2212 \u03bc ( p0 ,T0 ) = \u23a1\u23a3 c p \u2212 \u015c( p0 ,T0 ) \u23a4\u23a6 (T \u2212 T0 ).\n(16)\nInserting (16) into equation (13), and taking into\naccount condition (14) we get the GTC potential as\na function of the vertical coordinate and the temperature:\n\n\u03b5 (z,T ) = m\u0302\u03c8 (z) + \u015cT + \u03bc (T )\n= gm\u0302z + c p (T \u2212 T0 ) + T0 \u22c5 \u015c(T0 , p0 ) + \u03bc (T0 , p0 ).\n\n(17)\nWe now assume GTC equilibrium, i. e.,\n\u03b5(z) = const.\nWith equation (17) we find\n\ngm\u0302\nz\ncp\n\ngrad \u03b5 = m\u0302 *grad \u03c8 + \u015c gradT + T grad \u015c + grad \u03bc,\n\nT (z) = T (0) \u2013\n\ni. e. a relation which not only contains the gradients\nof the three intensive variables \u03c8, T and \u03bc, but also\nthe gradient of the molar entropy .\n\nor, using the numerical values of g, m\u0302 and cp:\n\nWe see, however, that the equation\ngrad \u03b5(z) = 0\n\n(15)\n\n(18)\n\nK\n\u22c5 z,\nm\ni. e. a linear decrease of the temperature with the\nheight.\nT (z) = T (0) \u2013 0.0098\n\n\f11\n\n10\n\nz (km)\n\n5\n\n10 z (km)\n\n10 z (km)\n\n5\n\n0\n10\n20\nm\u02c6 !

The adiabatic atmosphere. The dashed lines correspond to an initial state in which the GTC equilibrium is perturbed. The full\nlines represent the final equilibrium. In this state of GTC equilibrium, the gravitational and the chemical driving forces balance the\nthermal driving force. (Scales are not the same as in Figure 1.)\n\nAgain, we have found an \"old friend\". If, in the case\nof GTC equilibrium, we divide \u03b5(z) by cp we get\nwhat in the meteorological literature is called the\npotential temperature.\nLet us assume p0 and T0 to be the pressure and the\ntemperature values for z = 0. Moreover, we shall\ncall \u015c( p0 ,T0 ) = \u015c0 and choose \u03bc(p0, T0) = 0. Using\n\nFigure 2 resumes our results graphically. The dashed\nlines correspond to an initial state in which the GTC\nequilibrium is perturbed. The full lines represent the\nequlibrium profiles. Notice that in the case of GTC\nequilibrium, the gravitational and the chemical driving forces point downwards. Both together are balanced by the thermal driving force which points\nupwards.\n\n(18) equation (16) becomes\n\n\u239b \u015c\n\u239e\n\u03bc (z) = \u239c 0 \u2013 1\u239f \u22c5 g \u22c5 m\u0302 \u22c5 z .\n\u239d cp \u23a0\n\nC. Static equilibrium\n\nAgain, we shall write the equation with numerical\nvalues. For \u015c0 we take 198.7 J mol\u20131 K\u20131 , which is\nthe molar entropy of dry air at normal conditions,\ni. e., at T = 298 K and p = 1 bar:\n\n1.66J\n\u22c5 z.\nmol \u22c5 m\nJust as in the case of the isothermal atmosphere, the\nchemical potential is a linear function of the height.\nWhereas for the isothermal atmosphere \u03bc decreases\nwith z, in the adiabatic atmosphere the chemical\npotential is an increasing function of the vertical\ncoordinate.\n\n\u03bc (z) =\n\nWe finally calculate the pressure profile of the adiabatic atmosphere by combining equation (15) with\nequation (18):\n\n\u239b\ngm\u0302 \u239e\np(z) = p(0) \u239c 1 \u2212\n\u22c5 z\u239f\n\u239d c pT0 \u23a0\n\nc p /R\n\n.\n\nIn order to understand the dry atmosphere we have\nto discuss one more equilibrium. Let us first consider an \"air column\" within a closed tube, Figure 3.\nAt the beginning, we prevent the air from flowing\nby means of a barrier which can be removed later.\nWe also assume that there is no other convection\nwithin the tube. We first impose an arbitrary temperature profile over the length of the tube. We thus\nget a well-defined pressure profile. We then open the\n\nFig. 3. If an arbitrary temperature profile (in the direction of the\ntube) is imposed on the air within the tube and then the barrier\nis opened, the air will relax into a state, in which its center of\nmass is at its lowest point.\n\n\f12\n\nbarrier. The air will begin to flow in the direction of\nthe tube but, after a while, due to the friction at the\nwalls, it will come to rest. A new equilibrium has\nestablished which is characterized by the fact that\nthe center of mass of the air column has reached its\nlowest position. As this process goes on, the hydrostatic equilibrium has always acommodated itself.\nWe call the final state the static equilibrium. Sometimes, also this equilibrium is called hydrostatic\nequlibrium. We remind, that the equilibrium defined\nby equation (12) is an equilibrium of another kind.\nThat is why we give it another name.\nLet us now study the establishment of the static\nequilibrium for different initial temperature profiles.\nWe shall, however, always choose this profil identical in both vertical legs of the tube. Thus, when\nopening the barrier, we have static equilibrium in\nany case, but this equilibrium can be stable, unstable\nor neutral. It is neutral if\n\u015c (z) = const,\ni. e. if the air is in GTC equilibrium. In this case, a\ndisplacement of the air column in the direction of\nthe tube doesn't cause any change in the temperature\nor pressure profile.\nIf the temperature decrease with z is steeper than\naccording to equation (18), the static equilibrium,\nand thus, the \"stratification\", is stable. If the slope is\nmore gentle, the stratification is unstable. If the\ntemperature profile matches equation (18), the\nstratification is neutral. Of course, one can have\ntemperature profiles which cause the stratification to\nbe stable for certain intervals of the vertical coordinate z and unstable or neutral for others. We remember, that by mixing the atmosphere, one produces conditions in which the GTC equilibrium establishes itself. We now see, that mixing always\ncauses a neutral stratification.\nD. Equilibria of the atmosphere by day and by\nnight\nWe have seen that turbulence drives the atmosphere\ntowards a state with\n\u015c (z) = const.\nIn this state, the temperature gradient is not equal to\nzero, i. e. a thermal driving force exists. If there was\nno turbulence, this thermal driving force would become effective. A hypothetical atmosphere, which\ndoes not exchange energy neither with the earth nor\n\nwith the cosmos, would, after a long time, move\ninto thermal equilibrium. Eventually, the atmosphere would reach the thermal and the hydrostatic\nequilibrium, but not the GTC equilibrium. The corresponding stratification would be stable. Actually,\nour real atmosphere does not reach this state, but it\ntries to do so every night, with some success. During the night (if the sky is clear) the surface of the\nearth cools more rapidly than the air. (The reason is\nthat the surface of the earth behaves more like a\nblack body than the air.) As a consequence, the air\nnear to the ground cools more rapidly than the air of\nthe higher layers of the troposphere. This causes a\ndeviation from the GTC equilibrium corresponding\nto a stable stratification. The situation is very different during the day. At day-time the atmosphere is\nheated from below, thereby getting in a state of an\nunstable stratification. As a result, the atmosphere\ntends to turn over and induce turbulences, thereby\ncoming back to the condition for GTC equilibrium.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe are taught in thermodynamics that one has to\ndistinguish various types of equilibrium. In the simplest case, to every extensive quantity belongs one\ntype of equilibrium. If two or more extensive quantities are tightly coupled, combined equilibria will\nestablish, and it is reasonable to define combined\npotentials.\nWe have shown, that\n\u2013 the isothermal atmosphere is characterized by a\nconstant gravito-chemical potential;\n\u2013 the adiabatic,well-mixed atmosphere is characterized by a constant gravito-thermo-chemical potential.\nThus, the linear decrease of the temperature with the\nvertical coordinate corresponds to a state of equilibrium. The fact that the real temperatures often substantially deviate from this temperature profile is\ndue to a permanent perturbation of this equilibrium.\n\n\f13\n\nJ. W., The Scientific Papers of J.
