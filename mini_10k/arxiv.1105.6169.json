Tobar\n\narXiv:1105.6169v1 [physics.ins-det] 31 May 2011\n\nSchool of Physics, University of Western Australia, WA 6009 Australia\n(Dated: August 13, 2018)\nHidden sector photons are a weakly interacting slim particle arising from an additional U(1)\ngauge symmetry predicted by many standard model extensions. We present and demonstrate a new\nexperimental method using a single microwave cavity to search for hidden sector photons. Only\nphotons with a great enough energy are able to oscillate into hidden sector photons of a particular\nmass. If our cavity is driven on resonance and tuned over the corresponding threshold frequency,\nthere is an observable drop in the circulating power signifying the creation of hidden sector photons.\nThis approach avoids the problems of microwave leakage and frequency matching inherent in photon\nregeneration techniques.\n\nExtensions to the standard model of particle physics\ncommonly predict an extra hidden U(1) gauge symmetry [1, 2]. This corresponds to a hidden sector of particles where by the only interaction to standard matter is\nthrough kinetic mixing between the hidden sector photon\n\u03b3 \u2032 and ordinary photon \u03b3 [3, 4]. The mass of the hidden\nsector photon is unknown but thought to be very light\nand belong to a class of hypothetical particles known as\nWISPs (Weakly Interacting Slim/Sub-eV Particles) [5].\nTypically, experiments to search for the hidden sector\nphoton in this sub-eV range have utilized the (resonantly\nenhanced) photon regeneration \"light shining through a\nwall\" (LSW) method [3, 6] with either a laboratory [7\u2013\n11] or astronomical [12, 13] source of particles. Much\nprogress has been made with these experiments using\nlaser light [14\u201324] and, more recently, microwaves [25, 26]\nto place limits on the existence of hidden sector photons.\nIn this letter we propose and experimentally test a\nnovel method for hidden sector photon searches. Differing from the standard approach of photon regeneration\nour design uses only a single microwave cavity and indirectly looks for hidden sector photons by energy leaving\nthe system. A measurable drop in circulating power can\npotentially be observed if the cavity is tuned over the\nhidden sector photon creation threshold frequency. This\napproach does not suffer from the problems of microwave\nleakage and frequency matching inherent in traditional\nLSW experiments.\nIf the hidden sector photon has a mass then only photons with an energy greater than the hidden sector photon rest energy can oscillate into hidden sector photons,\ni.e. hf \u2265 m\u03b3\u2032 c2 for \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2032 . Thus if we tune the frequency of a cavity, and hence energy of the resonating\nphotons, over the threshold value then we can expect to\nsee a sudden drop in circulating power as some photons\nstart suddenly oscillating into hidden sector photons and\nescaping the cavity. This allows for a sensitive detection\nof a hidden sector photon event but only for the narrow\nrange of masses which the cavity can tune through.\nThe threshold crossing effect is determined by calculating the loss due to photons leaving the cavity through\nphoton-hidden sector photon oscillations.

Below the threshold 1/Q\u03b3\u2032 = 0 and thus we can create a fit\nto the data\nPtrans\nPinc\n\n4\n\nf <fth\n\n=\n\n2\n\n(X(f ) + B)\n\n= \u03be(f )\n\nNow we can look at the data above the threshold and\ntake the residuals of the derivative, equation (8),\nResidual\n\n4\n1\n\u221a 1\n\u03b71 \u03b72 Q\u03b3\n\n2\n\nCavity\n\nwhere QL is the loaded quality factor and Q0 is the unloaded quality factor idealizing an isolated cavity with\nno input or output. Q\u03b3 and Q\u03b3\u2032 represent the standard\nphoton and hidden sector photon portions of Q0 respectively.\nSearching for hidden sector photons is then carried out\nby taking measurements from our cavity related to Q\u03b3\u2032\nas the frequency is tuned. To continue driving the cavity\non resonance a frequency lock system is required.\nTo demonstrate this threshold crossing approach we\nset up a simple prototype experiment. The essential elements are a tunable microwave cavity, a locked driving\nsignal and frequency and power measurements. For our\nprototype we used a copper cavity at room temperature\nin a vacuum. The length and diameter of the cavity\nwere approximately 2 c m, and the TM 0 1 0 resonance frequency was around 10.402 GHz. Tuning was carried out\nby a heating element and temperature controller between\n300 K and 324 K, corresponding to a 4 MHz frequency\nspan. To drive and lock to the cavity a Pound control\nscheme loop oscillator was used [28]. A schematic of the\nexperiment setup is given in Fig. 3.\nIn our prototype experiment we applied only a very\nsmall amount of tuning and thus the external quality\nfactors remain constant, \u03b21 /Q0 = \u03b71 and \u03b22 /Q0 = \u03b72 .\nAn initial measurement of \u03b21 , \u03b22 and QL was used to\ndetermine \u03b71 and \u03b72 , these are shown in Table I.\nFrom equations (5) it follows that\nPtrans\n=\u0010\nPinc\n\nV\n\n\u0012\n\nd Ptrans\ndf Pinc\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00013/2\n\u2212 \u03be(f )\nd 1\n(f ),\n= \u221a\n\u03b71 \u03b72 df Q\u03b3\u2032\n0\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is proportional to \u03c72 . The comparison with data\nwill depend on the standard deviation of the derivative\nof Ptrans /Pinc , i.e. of the \u03be \u2032 (f ) fit, and the frequency\nresolution (bin width) of the data.\nData from our experiment was collected in 4 continuous runs, 2 of heating up and 2 of cooling down. Detector\nvoltages were converted into the incident and transmitted\npower levels as a function of frequency. Each data set of\nPtrans /Pinc was then put into frequency bins of \u2206f = 100,\n1000 and 10000 Hz. These binned data sets were then\nsearched for hidden sector photons by scanning through\n\n\f4\n-1.0\n\nfrequency stability according to\n\n-1.2\n\nResolution = Bandwidth \u00d7 Line splitting factor,\n\nLog10 H \u03a7L\n\n-1.4\n\nBandwidth = f /QL ,\n\n-1.6\n\nLine splitting factor = QL \u00d7 \u03c3y (\u03c4 ),\n\n-1.8\n-2.0\n-2.2\n-2.4\n43.020\n\n43.025\n\n43.030\n\n43.035\n\nm\u0393\u00a2 c2 @\u03bc eVD\n\nFIG. 4. Hidden sector photon exclusion plot from the prototype threshold crossing experiment.\n\nand testing for a threshold frequency in each bin. The\ncentral difference quotient of the residuals were compared\nagainst the worst possible discretization and certainty of\nequation (9). For our analysis a 3rd order approximation\nof 1/Q\u03b3\u2032 was used.\nLimits of \u03c7 were placed with a one standard deviation,\n\u03c3, buffer, calculated from the \u03be \u2032 (f ) fit, added to the data.\nThe compiled results are given in Fig. 4. The limit covers only a narrow range of hidden sector photon masses\nrelated to the narrow range of frequencies tuned across.\nAs a prototype experiment the results on \u03c7 are not competitive with other experimental tests. However, there is\nsignificant room for improvement and we will show the\npossibility of a competitive experiment.\nIn the case of no hidden sector photons the limit on \u03c7\nis related to \u03c3 and the discretized equation (9) as\n\u221a\n\u03c7\u221d \u03c3\n\ns\n\np\n1 p\n4\n\u2206f 4 fth .\nQ\u03b3\n\nTo improve our limit each of these items needs to be\nminimized.\nAs expected the limit has a strong dependence on the\ncavity quality factor Q\u03b3 . Using superconducting Niobium cavities at cryogenic temperatures Q\u03b3 \u223c 1010 is\npossible [29].\nThe standard deviation of our difference quotient data,\n\u03c3 is proportional to the deviation in the original data\nwhich in turn is proportional to the amplitude noise of\nour system. By using better microwave amplifiers, detectors and measuring techniques this can easily be improved. Of particular issue in our prototype experiment,\nthe lock-in amplifier was not ideal for a low Q cavity. A\nprocess of tuning, stabilizing, then measuring will produce much better results (albeit taking longer) than continuously drifting while measuring. Our experiment had\nan amplitude noise of \u221280 dBc/Hz whilst values around\n\u2212120 dBc/Hz are obtainable [30].\nThe minimal usable bin width \u2206f is determined by\nthe best obtainable resolution which is limited by the\n\nwhere \u03c3y is the frequency stability of the oscillator and\n\u03c4 is the sampling time. Any frequency drift needs to\nbe less than resolution/sampling time. A line splitting\nfactor \u223c 10\u22127 is potentially achievable [31] so for a cavity\nof quality factor \u223c 1010 at 10GHz the smallest usable bin\nwidth is \u2206f \u223c 10\u22126 Hz.\nLower frequency thresholds of investigation, i.e. larger\ncavity sizes, also slightly improve results but this is not\nsomething we want to strictly minimize. Comparing the\nabove achievable values to our prototype experiment we\nfind that a limit of \u03c7 < 10\u221210 is possible.\nFurthermore there is potential to improve the limits on\n\u03c7 by employing more advanced data analysis techniques.\nIn data with improved stability it may be possible to\nuse optimal filter analysis to get a tighter hidden sector\nphoton restriction.\nIn this letter we have proposed and formulated a new\nexperimental method to search for hidden sector photons\nusing microwave cavities. A prototype experiment was\ncarried out to demonstrate the idea. With an improved\ncryogenic experimental setup this approach allows exceptionally small values of the hidden sector photon mixing\nparameter \u03c7 to be probed over a narrow range of hidden\nsector photon masses without the necessity of a detection\ncavity, in which microwave leakage and resonance matching are problematic. The achievable results are well beyond the current limits and are in potential discovery\nspace.\nThe authors would like to thank Joerg Jaeckel and Ian\nMcArthur for helpful discussions.
