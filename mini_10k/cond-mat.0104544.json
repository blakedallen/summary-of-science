INTRODUCTION\n\nWhile the values of the critical parameters for the fully symmetric hard-sphere model\nof an electrolyte (the \"restricted primitive model\" or RPM [1\u20133]) have received extensive\ntheoretical attention for a number of years (see, e.g., [3\u201310]), only recently has interest\nfocussed on the effects of asymmetry on phase-coexistence and criticality [11\u201317]. Sabir,\nBhuiyan, and Outhwaite [11] used the mean spherical approximation (MSA) and two different Poisson-Boltzmann approaches to compute critical parameters resulting from both\nsize and charge asymmetry; the reduced critical density, \u03c1\u2217c , was always reported to increase\nwith greater size asymmetry, but the trends for the reduced critical temperature, Tc\u2217 , were\ninconsistent. (For appropriate definitions of reduced temperature and density, see [14] and\nbelow.) Gonzalez-Tovar used the MSA and found, via the energy route, that both Tc\u2217 and\n\u03c1\u2217c increased with greater size asymmetry [12]. Most recently, Raineri, Routh, and Stell also\nemployed the MSA, but augmented the analysis by incorporating Bjerrum-Ebeling-Grigo\npairing; they likewise predicted that both Tc\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217c increase monotonically with size asymmetry [13]. Recent simulations by Romero-Enrique et al. [14] (see also [15]), however, reveal\nthe opposite trends - namely, that critical temperature and density decrease strongly with\nincreasing size asymmetry. Hence, as remarked in [14], our current state of even qualitative\ntheoretical understanding appears less than adequate.\nThe present report therefore formulates and analyzes extensions of the Debye-H\u00fcckel\n(DH) approach [1] to asymmetric primitive models [17]. We may recall that the original DH\ntheory, when supplemented by Bjerrum ion pairing [2] and dipolar-pair solvation in the ionic\nfluid [9], remains the most quantitatively successful theory of coexistence and criticality in\nthe size-symmetric RPM (see, e.g., [7(b),10]). One might, thus, reasonably hope that a\nsuitable extension of the DH and (DHBjDI [9]) theories to unequal ion sizes will, at least,\nyield correct trends in the dependence of Tc\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217c on asymmetry.\nIn fact, in their original 1923 paper, Debye and H\u00fcckel [1] already claimed to have explicit\nresults for asymmetric primitive models (see [17]). However, serious flaws in this historic\nformulation suggest other, more systematic extensions of symmetric DH theory appropriate\nfor the asymmetric case [17]. We analyze these improved \"asymmetric Debye-H\u00fcckel\" (ADH)\ntheories by comparison with exact series expansions and newly developed bounds, and also\nassess their general physical character. We find, in fact, that, contrary to Refs. [11\u201313], the\ncritical parameters predicted by our modified ADH theories [17] exhibit trends in agreement\nwith those obtained in the recent simulations [14,15].\nIn order to focus on the effects of size asymmetry, we confine the present discussion\nprimarily to the two-species size-asymmetric primitive model (or SAPM), which consists of\nequal numbers, N+ = N\u2212 , of positive and negative ions with hard-core diameters a\u2212\u2212 \u2265 a++ ,\nand charges of equal magnitudes q+ = \u2212q\u2212 = z\u00b1 q0 . (Of course, the complementary case\na++ > a\u2212\u2212 follows trivially by symmetry.) All material and space is assumed to possess a\nuniform dielectric constant, D. For the most part, we also assume additivity of diameters,\na+\u2212 \u2261 a = 21 (a++ + a\u2212\u2212 ).\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe degree of asymmetry will be described either by the fractional deviations from a, namely,\n\u03b4\u03c3 = (a\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 a)/a\n\n(\u03c3 = +, \u2212) ,\n2\n\n(1.2)\n\n\for by the diameter ratio [14],\n\u03bb = a\u2212\u2212 /a++ = (1 + \u03b4\u2212 )/(1 \u2212 \u03b4\u2212 ),\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that \u03b4+ = \u2212\u03b4\u2212 for the additive case. Note that the general\nasymmetric primitive model electrolyte possesses a large - in fact, three-dimensional -\nparameter space: two degrees of freedom for size asymmetry (since additivity need not be\nassumed) and one for charge asymmetry (noting that the overall magnitude is irrelevant).\nWe take the total number density to be \u03c1 = N/V , with V the volume and N = N+ + N\u2212 .\nThe reduced density is then appropriately defined by [14]\n\u03c1\u2217 = (\u03c1+ + \u03c1\u2212 )a3 ,\n\n(1.4)\n\n<\nwhich seems the most relevant parameter since the critical densities are typically low, \u03c1\u2217c \u223c\n0.1. But we note that other workers have used alternative definitions [11,13]. The natural\ntemperature scale for studying criticality (i.e., low temperatures) in the SAPM is set by the\nenergy of an attractive pair of ions at contact, so we take\nT \u2217 = kB T /(|q+ q\u2212 |/Da+\u2212 ) .\n\n(1.5)\n\nIt is also convenient to define the reduced electrostatic energy, normalized by the energy of\nclosest approach of a (+, \u2212) pair, namely,\nu(\u03c1, T ) \u2261 UNex (\u03c1, T )/N(|q+ q\u2212 |/Da),\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere UNex (\u2261 UN \u2212 23 NkB T ) is the overall excess energy.\nThe theoretical description of size-asymmetric models is, naturally, more complicated\nthan in the symmetric case. Specifically, in considering the correlations and fluctuations in\nthe neighborhood of a particular ion (which, following DH, we may suppose is fixed at the\norigin), three distinct surrounding spherical shells or zones must be accounted for. To see\nthis, suppose first that the selected, fixed ion is positive and that the diameters are ordered\nin size according to a++ < a+\u2212 < a\u2212\u2212 : we term this the \"inner\" case since the like-like\ndiameter of the central charge is smaller than a+\u2212 . Trivially, no ion center can enter the\n\"interior\" zone 0 < r < a++ , where r is the radial distance from the origin; of course, this\napplies to the symmetric RPM as well. New to the SAPM, however, is the \"border\" zone\n(or, more precisely, the \"sub-border\" zone) a++ < r < a+\u2212 for this \"inner\" scenario, that\nis shown shaded in Fig. 1: this can be populated only by the centers of the smaller, i.e.,\npositive, ions; the larger negative ions are excluded. Finally, as in the symmetric model,\npositive and negative ions may be present in the exterior zone r > a+\u2212 . When a larger\nnegative ion is chosen to be at the origin, there is a complementary \"super-border\" zone,\na+\u2212 < r < a\u2212\u2212 , into which only positive charges can penetrate.\nThe presence of these \"charge-unbalanced\" zones in the asymmetric case turns out to play\na crucial role which, in particular, means that the simple extension of the DH treatment\n(ADH theory), although in agreement in leading orders at high T with the exact series\nexpansions [3,16,17], fails badly at lower temperatures. This is shown below in Sec. II after\nwe develop the ADH formulation, which allows for the border zones. While the failure\nis not entirely surprising, since the general DH formulation relies on a high-temperature\n3\n\n\fexpansion, it does present a sharp contrast to the symmetric case. One striking consequence\nof the difficulties is the theory's violation, at low temperatures, of an extension of Onsager's\nlower bound for the (internal) energy of the RPM [18] that we establish in Appendix A for\ngeneral primitive models that are asymmetric in both charge and in size.\nIt is an interesting fact that analysis of the general primitive model with nonadditive\ndiameters presents few additional problems in most cases. (See, e.g., [16] and references\ntherein.) On the other hand, the nonadditive models are potentially useful in applications\nbecause they can represent short range interactions beyond the pure Coulombic couplings.\nThus if, for example, a++ = a\u2212\u2212 = a0 , so that one has a size-symmetric model, but a+\u2212 > a0 ,\na moment's consideration shows that unlike ions experience a strong short-range repulsion\nrelative to the geometric ion size a0 . This competes with the ionic attractions and, thus, for\nexample, increases the relative size of a Bjerrum pair and decreases its stability. Conversely,\nthe case a+\u2212 < a0 can be viewed as representing an enhanced short range repulsion between\nlike ions of a \"true\" diameter less than a0 . In reality, of course, the interactions in ionic\nsystems deviate from pure electrostatics at short distances. Accordingly, although we mainly\nfocus below on the additive case, we briefly indicate where necessary how to construct DH\ntheories for the general, nonadditive model [17]. We believe this theory is of interest in its\nown right as well as providing a basis for more elaborate treatments. Further details of the\nlinear asymmetric DH theory are also given in [17].\nBecause of the failures of the linear asymmetric DH theory, we have explored some\nmodifications that, for modest degrees of asymmetry, ensure satisfaction of the energy bound\nof Appendix A and of thermal convexity requirements [10]; these criteria are also satisfied\nfor large asymmetry in the critical and coexistence regions. The modified ADH theories\naccomplish this by specifically allowing for, and compensating in a natural way, the charge\nimbalances induced by the existence of the border zones [17]. These theories are expounded\nin Sec. III and their predictions for criticality are examined in Sec. IV. It transpires, as\nmentioned above, that the simplest modified theories appear to be the first theoretical\ntreatments to predict correctly (as judged by the simulations [14,15]) that both Tc\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217c\n> 4, the critical density\nfall when size asymmetry is introduced; however, for \u03bb = a\u2212\u2212 /a++ \u223c\ndisplays incorrect, nonmonotonic behavior. Finally, Sec. V presents a brief overview and\nsome conclusions.\n\n4\n\n\fII. ASYMMETRIC DEBYE-H\u00dcCKEL THEORY\nA. Formulation of the theory\n\nIn this subsection we present the ADH theory. Since the cost in additional complexity\nis slight, we consider here (and in Appendix A) a general two-species model with point\ncharges q\u03c3 = z\u03c3 q0 (\u03c3 = +, \u2212) centered in hard spheres of diameters a\u03c3\u03c3 with the collision\ndiameters, a\u03c3\u03c4 , restricted only by a++ \u2264 a \u2261 a+\u2212 \u2264 a\u2212\u2212 . The Debye-H\u00fcckel procedure [1],\ninterpreted generally, directs one to calculate the excess thermodynamic functions, based\non approximations for the correlation functions which are then integrated via the \"energy\nroute\" [19]. Specifically, defining \u03c8\u03c3 to be the average electrostatic potential at a (fixed) ion\nof species \u03c3 due to all other ions, the reduced electrostatic energy, defined in (1.6), is given\nby\nu=\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nDa\n<\n>\n\u03c8+\n\u2212 \u03c8\u2212\n,\n2(z+ \u2212 z\u2212 )q0\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the superscripts < and > merely serve as reminders of the relative ion sizes, and also\nfacilitate formulation of the nonadditive case. Other thermodynamic quantities, such as the\nfree energy and pressure, follow in principle after suitable integrations and differentiations.\nWe derive an explicit closed form expression for the internal energy as a function of T and\n\u03c1, and the second virial term for the pressure is also discussed.\nWe begin the calculation of the ion potentials \u03c8\u03c3 (T, \u03c1) by fixing an ion of species \u03c3 at\nthe origin, as in Fig. 1. The induced electrostatic potential, \u03c6(r), and corresponding charge\ndensity, \u03c1q (r), are then related by the (exact) averaged Poisson equation, namely,\n\u22072 h\u03c6(r)i\u03c3 = \u2212\n\n4\u03c0\nh\u03c1q (r)i\u03c3 ,\nD\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the subscript \u03c3 indicates that the averages are performed with a charge of species \u03c3\nat the origin [19]. The ion potentials follow from the limit\n\u0014\n\n\u03c8\u03c3 (T, \u03c1) = lim h\u03c6(r)i\u03c3 \u2212\nr\u21920\n\nq\u03c3\nDr\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich eliminates the self-interaction of the fixed charge at the origin.\nThe DH procedure then introduces two approximations for the average charge density,\nh\u03c1q (r)i\u03c3 . The well-known Poisson-Boltzmann approximation is followed by a linearization\nof the exponential in the Boltzmann factors, yielding\nh\u03c1q (r)i\u03c3 \u2243\n\u2243\n\nX\n\n\u03c4 =+,\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03c4 =+,\u2212\n\nq\u03c4 \u03c1\u03c4 exp [\u2212\u03b2q\u03c4 h\u03c6(r)i\u03c3 ] ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nq\u03c4 \u03c1\u03c4 [1 \u2212 \u03b2q\u03c4 h\u03c6(r)i\u03c3 ] ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T . In the size-asymmetric models, the approximate charge density must be\nallowed to take a different form in each of the three distinct zones around the central charge.\nThus, when the fixed charge is positive (\u03c3 = +) one has\n5\n\n\fh\u03c1q (r)i+ = q+ \u03b4(r)\n\u2243 q+ \u03c1+ [1 \u2212 \u03b2q+ h\u03c6(r)i+ ]\n\u2243 \u2212(\u03ba2D /4\u03c0)h\u03c6(r)i+\n\nfor r < a++ ,\nfor a++ < r < a ,\nfor r > a ,\n\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\n\nwhere, as usual [19], overall electroneutrality has been imposed. Here, the inverse Debye\nlength is defined in the standard way via\n(\u03baD a)2 = x2D = (4\u03c0a2 q02 /DkB T )\n\nX\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c1\u03c3 z\u03c32 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nNote: (i) there is no approximation in the innermost exclusion zone (r < a++ ); (ii) the\nsub-border zone (a++ < r < a = a+\u2212 ) can contain none of the larger negative ions so that in\n(2.7), which represents the fundamental extension of the original DH theory, only q+ appears\non the right-hand side; and (iii) the exterior zone (r > a) follows the standard Debye-H\u00fcckel\nform as in the symmetric RPM [1,19].\nThe approximations (2.6)-(2.8) complete the reduction of the averaged Poisson equation\n(2.2) to the basic ADH equation for a + ion. This may be solved for four unknown coefficients\nusing standard electrostatic boundary conditions (continuity of \u03c6 and \u2202\u03c6/\u2202r) at r = a++\nand r = a+\u2212 = a with \u03c6(r) \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e [19], from which \u03c8+ follows via (2.3). The closed\nforms for the electrostatic energy in the ADH approximation then result from combining the\ngeneral expression for the energy (2.1) with the appropriate expressions for the \u03c8\u03c3 potentials,\nwhich are presented below.

Furthermore, small diameters, a, are of interest; but \u03c8\u03c3<\ndiverges for \"point\" ions, i.e., in the limit a\u03c3\u03c3 \u2192 0 (or \u03b4\u03c3 \u2192 \u22121). This, in fact, serves as a\nwarning sign, as will be seen below.\nB. Assessment of ADH Theory\n\nWe now examine the predictions of the linear ADH theory. Following Debye and H\u00fcckel\n[1,19], the free energy is to be obtained from the internal energy in (2.1) by employing the\nDebye charging process (which is equivalent to using the standard thermodynamic relation\nfor the free energy in terms of the energy). This yields the reduced excess free energy density\nas\nf \u0304ex (T, \u03c1; {z\u03c3 }, {\u03b4\u03c3 }) \u2261 \u2212Aex\nN (V ; T )/V kB T ,\nZ 1\nh\ni\n\u2212D\u03ba2D\n<\n>\n=\nd\u03b6 \u03c8+\n(\u03b6q0 ) \u2212 \u03c8\u2212\n(\u03b6q0 ) ,\n4\u03c0q0 (z+ \u2212 z\u2212 ) 0\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere Aex\nN is the total excess Helmholtz free energy. It must be recalled that in addition\nto the explicit dependence on q0 (and, hence, on \u03b6) entering (2.1) via (2.11) and (2.17), an\nimplicit dependence occurs via \u03baD \u221d q0 which enters (2.12)-(2.16) and (2.18)-(2.22).\nExcept in the standard symmetric case (\u03bb = 0, \u03b4+ = \u03b4\u2212 = 0) most of the integrals\ninvolved in (2.24) seem intractable. Nevertheless, one may derive an expansion for the\nfree energy, and thence for all other thermodynamic quantities, such as the pressure, by\nexpanding the expressions (2.11)-(2.22) and integrating term by term. By this route, we can\ncheck the theory against exactly known expansions (see, e.g., [3,16,17]).\nThus, consider the low-density/high-temperature expansion for the general primitive\nmodel (with arbitrary charges q\u03c3 = z\u03c3 q0 and diameters a\u03c3\u03c4 ) which is known to overall order\n\u03c15/2 in the density. On specializing to the two-component case, this may be written\n7\n\n\f\u2020\nf \u0304(T, \u03c1) = \u03ba3D /12\u03c0 + B2,3\n\u03c12 ln (\u03baD a)/T \u22173\n2\n\n+\u03c1\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nB2,n /T \u2217 n + O[\u03c15/2 ln (\u03baD a)] ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nn=0\n\n\u221a\nwhere we again recall \u03baD a \u2261 xD \u221d \u03c1\u2217 . The leading term here varies as \u03c13/2 and represents\nthe DH limiting law reproduced by all sensible approximations. The coefficient B2,0 derives\nfrom the second virial coefficient for a pure hard-sphere gas. At the present level of approximation, this may be accounted for precisely by including the hard-core free energy density,\n\u2020\nf \u0304HC , in the basic approximation [9]. The remaining coefficients B2,1 , B2,2 , B2,3\n, B2,3 , B2,4 , . . .\narise from the electrostatic interactions.\nNow, DH-based approximations (in common with the MSA, etc.) cannot generate the\n\u2020\n2\n\u03c1 (ln \u03c1)/T 3 term with coefficient B2,3\n. However, our linear ADH theory yields the exact\nleading coefficients in order 1/T and 1/T 2. Explicitly we find\nB2,1\n\n\"\n\n\u03b4+ (2 + \u03b4+ ) + \u03b4\u2212 (2 + \u03b4\u2212 )\n= \u03c0a |z+ z\u2212 |\n(z+ \u2212 z\u2212 )2\n3\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhich vanishes for the size-symmetric models (with \u03b4\u03c3 = 0), and\nB2,2 = \u2212\u03c0a3\n\n2\nz 2 \u03b4+ + z\u2212\n\u03b4\u2212\n1+ +\n(z+ \u2212 z\u2212 )2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(2.27)\n\nIt is, indeed, striking that the exact leading order dependences in powers of 1/T are reproduced for arbitrary diameters, a++ , a+\u2212 , and a\u2212\u2212 (including nonadditivity and point\ncharges). However, one probably should not be so surprised since the arguments leading\nto the basic ADH equations, (2.2) with (2.4) and (2.5) are, on reflection, clearly valid to\nleading orders in \u03c1 and 1/T even if it is not obvious how far the validity will go.\nTo study the ADH theory more quantitatively, we focus on the energy for the additive\n1:1 case (z+ = \u2212z\u2212 = 1). No integrations are then required. Fig. 2 displays energy isochores\nas functions of T \u2217 at high and low temperatures for degrees of asymmetry \u03bb = a\u2212\u2212 /a++ = 1\n(the RPM for reference, solid curves), 2, 4 and 6. These values of \u03bb correspond to size\ndeviations |\u03b4+ | = \u03b4\u2212 = 0, 13 , 53 and 57 , respectively. It is evident that ADH theory predicts that\nsize-asymmetry lowers the electrostatic energy, with the effects being greatest at the highest\nand lowest temperatures. At intermediate T the predictions for varying \u03bb are grouped\ntogether according to density.\nNotable features of the high-T plots of Fig. 2(a) are, first, that the finite values of u\nattained when T \u2192 \u221e are exact. This can be verified by a simple a priori calculation;\nalternatively, the values may be checked from the exact order \u03c12 /T term as displayed in\n(2.25) and (2.26) that is correctly reproduced by ADH theory. The limiting slopes at T \u2217 = \u221e\nare discussed in further in [17].\nThe behavior of u(T, \u03c1) at low temperatures proves, however, much less satisfactory.\nFrom Fig. 2(b) one sees that the energy is predicted to fall increasingly rapidly for increasing\nasymmetry when T falls, passing well below the ground-state prediction u = \u2212 12 of the\nsymmetric DH theory; but see also [10] for the DHBjDI extensions [9]. Most seriously,\nhowever, for large enough asymmetry, the energy drops below the 1:1 size-asymmetric lower\nbound, namely, u \u2265 \u22121, established in Appendix A (which also treats general z+ and z\u2212 ).\n8\n\n\fMore concretely, the ground states predicted by ADH theory follow from (2.1) and (2.23)\nwhich yield\nuADH (T = 0; \u03bb) = \u2212 81 (3 + \u03bb) .\n\n(2.28)\n\nThis expression evidently violates the bound when \u03bb > 5 ( or |\u03b4+ | = \u03b4\u2212 > 23 ).\nOf course, this is unacceptable, but even for smaller values of \u03bb this behavior casts doubt\non the value of the approximation at low T in the vicinity of the expected critical region.\nThe origin of this behavior can be understood physically by examining the ADH predictions\nfor the mean total charge, say Q<\n+ , within the sub-border zone a++ < r < a+\u2212 = a which\ncan only be penetrated by like, i.e., positive charges. Recalling the notations in (2.2) and\nthe approximations (2.4)-(2.8), the theory yields\nQ<\n+\n\n=\n\u2243\n\nZ\n\na+\u2212\n\nd3 r h\u03c1q (r)i+\n\na++\nZ a+\u2212\na++\n\nd3 r q+ \u03c1+ [1 \u2212 \u03b2q+ h\u03c6(r)i+ ] ,\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere the precise form of h\u03c6(r)i+ follows from the explicit solution of (2.2) with (2.6)-(2.8)\n<\n[17]. Now, when T \u2192 \u221e the approximation becomes exact, yielding Q<\n+ = q+ \u03c1+ V , where\nV < = 34 \u03c0(a+\u2212 3 \u2212 a++ 3 ) is the volume of the sub-border zone (see Fig. 1). At finite but\nlarge temperatures, (2.29) correctly predicts the linear decrease of Q<\n+ with \u03b2 as the (+, +)\nrepulsions come into play. Of course, the repulsions become increasingly effective as T\ndecreases so that, at low T , one expects Q<\n+ to remain positive but to be of magnitude only\n2\nV < q+ \u03c1+ exp (\u2212\u03b2q+\n/Da+\u2212 ) (although, because, of the negative screening cloud that builds\nup for r > a+\u2212 , this estimate might need to be modified somewhat).\nHowever, if one neglects the screening, the mean potential h\u03c6(r)i+ in (2.29) will be of\norder +q+ /Da+\u2212 , or larger, in the sub-border zone. Then, as T falls and \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e it is\nevident that (2.29) is likely to predict, first, a totally unphysical negative value for Q<\n+ (even\nthough no negative charges can enter the sub-border zone) and, eventually, a divergence of\nQ<\n+ to \u2212\u221e. Explicit calculations [17] fully bear this out. For example, when \u03bb = 2, and\n\u2217 <\n\u2217\n> \u2217\n\u03c1\u2217 = 0.01, one finds negative Q<\n+ for T \u223c 0.9; for \u03c1 = 0.1 (\u223c \u03c1c ) the change of sign is\ndelayed until T \u2217 \u2243 0.6 but the divergence to \u2212\u221e is more rapid. Since the ADH theory\nfor the border zones embodied in (2.5), (2.7), and (2.29) reflects a high-T expansion, the\nproblems at low T should not be a great surprise. On the other hand, the successes of the\noriginal DH theory for the symmetric case at low T (e.g., [9,10]) clearly hinge on the absence\nof any \"charge-unbalanced\" border zones.\nClearly the serious physical defects of the ADH treatment must be rectified if the theory\n< 1: and, we expect, T \u2217 < 0.1 [7\u201313]. Before addressing that\nis to have any value for T \u2217 \u223c\nc \u223c\ntask, however, we present, briefly, the original claims of Debye and H\u00fcckel [1] as regards a\nsystem of ions with arbitrary diameters.\nC. Original DH Theory\n\nIn their original 1923 paper, Debye and H\u00fcckel [1] did, in fact, discuss the case of an\n\"arbitrary ionic solution\" - that is, within the model they adopted, a mixture of hardspheres of varying diameters a\u03c3\u03c3 and charges q\u03c3 , or the general primitive model. However,\n9\n\n\fin their analysis no mention is made of the border zones in which charges of only species\nwith small enough diameters can be present. (Note that in the multispecies case there\nwill, in general, be a number of distinct border zones around each charge.) Rather, their\nargument is presented as if all species were of the same diameter [1,17]. The mathematics\nis then identical to that for the RPM. In our notation, Debye and H\u00fcckel thus present the\nconclusion\nz\u03c3 q0\n\u03c8\u03c3 = \u2212\nD\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03baD\n,\n1 + \u03baD a\u03c3\u03c3\n\n(2.30)\n\n(i.e., precisely the RPM result when a\u03c3\u03c3 \u2261 a). The equivalent free energy for a 1:1 model is\nthen\n3  \u0304DH\n\naf\n\n1\n=\n16\u03c0\n\n2 ln [1 + (1 + \u03b4+ )xD ] + [(1 + \u03b4+ )xD ]2 \u2212 2(1 + \u03b4+ )xD\n(1 + \u03b4+ )3\n)\n2 ln [1 + (1 + \u03b4\u2212 )xD ] + [(1 + \u03b4\u2212 )xD ]2 \u2212 2(1 + \u03b4\u2212 )xD\n+\n,\n(1 + \u03b4\u2212 )3\n\n(\n\n(2.31)\n\nfrom which predictions for criticality etc. follow: see below.\nNeglecting all the border zones spares this \"original DH\" theory the pathology of our\nADH theory, but seriously reduces the plausibility of their treatment for size-asymmetric\nmodels. Thus, not so surprisingly, the high-T /low-\u03c1 expansions of the thermodynamics\nresulting from (2.31) differ at the first correction to the limiting behavior - see B2,1 in\n(2.26) - from the exact results captured by our ADH theory; indeed, the former depends\nonly on the ratio x2D \u221d \u03c1/T , while the exact results are more complex.\n\n10\n\n\fIII. MODIFIED ASYMMETRIC DH THEORY\n\nWe now discuss a class of modifications of ADH theory (originally introduced in [17])\nwhich avoid the unphysical behavior of the charge density in the border zones: this behavior was identified in Sec. II.B above as a root cause of the pathological low-T behavior\nwhich included violations of the lower bound on the internal energy (Appendix A). In the\nfollowing section, we examine the predictions of these modified ADH theories for the critical\nparameters (including a comparison with the original, 1923 DH proposal for asymmetric\nsystems).\nA. Introduction of Border Zone Factors\n\nIt is clear from the previous considerations of the ADH prediction (2.29) for the charge\nin a sub-border zone, that the standard DH linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann exponential is generally inadequate in any zone where the mean charge is necessarily unbalanced\nbecause of strongly repulsive short-range, steric repulsions. As an alternative first step, that\nwill still yield an analytically tractable theory, we forego the self-consistent aspect of the\nPoisson-Boltzmann approximation (2.4) in the border zones and consider replacing the selfconsistently determined electrostatic potential h\u03c6(r)i\u03c3 by a fixed, but possibly temperatureand density-dependent effective potential, \u03c6\u2020\u03c3 (r; T, \u03c1).\nOne possibility is merely to use the bare potential, i.e., to put \u03c6\u2020\u03c3 = q\u03c3 /Dr. The right2\nhand side of (2.7) would then read q+ \u03c1+ exp (\u2212\u03b2q+\n/Dr); but an obvious drawback of such\nan approximation is that the resulting closure of Poisson's equation, (2.2), is no longer\nreadily solvable. Instead, we simplify further by neglecting the r-dependence of \u03c6\u2020\u03c3 . Thus\nwe introduce temperature-dependent border zone factors F < (T ) and F > (T ) and consider\nthe replacement of (2.7) for a sub-border zone by\n\nQ<\n+\n\n<\nh\u03c1q (r)i+ \u2261 \u03c1<\nq (r; T, \u03c1) \u2243 q+ \u03c1+ F (T ),\n\na++ < r < a .\n\n(3.1)\n\nLikewise, for a super-border zone (indicated, as before, by the superscript >) we advance\n>\nh\u03c1q (r)i\u2212 \u2261 \u03c1>\nq (r; T, \u03c1) \u2243 q+ \u03c1+ F (T ),\n\na < r < a\u2212\u2212 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe calculation of the \u03c8\u03c3 potentials now proceeds just as in Sec. II but the results take\na simpler form, which we distinguish by using a circumflex. Maintaining our convention of\na smaller positive ion (\u03b4+ < 0) and larger negative ion (\u03b4\u2212 > 0), we find\ni\nz+ q0 xD\n|z\u2212 |T \u2217 \u03b4+ F < (T ) h\n2\n=\u2212\n)\n,\n1 + xD\n2 + \u03b4+ \u2212 xD (\u03b4+ + 32 \u03b4+\nDa 1 + xD\n2(z+ \u2212 z\u2212 )\n(\n)\n\u2217\n>\nh\ni\nz\nq\nz\nT\n\u03b4\nF\n(T\n)\nx\n\u2212\n0\n+\n\u2212\nD\n>\n2\n\u03c8\u0302\u2212\n=\u2212\n1 + xD\n2 + \u03b4\u2212 + xD (\u03b4\u2212 + 13 \u03b4\u2212\n)\n.\nDa 1 + xD\n2(z+ \u2212 z\u2212 )\n<\n\u03c8\u0302+\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nThese modified potentials, valid for general F (T ), reproduce the symmetric DH theory\nwhen \u03b4\u03c3 \u2192 0, and always generate the standard limiting laws when \u03c1 \u2192 0. For large\nxD \u221d (\u03c1/T )1/2 , these approximations for the \u03c8\u03c3 behave as x2D T F , whereas the standard DH\n11\n\n\fexpressions approach constants. While the consequences of this fact are not obvious, some\nnumerical results are discussed in Sec. III.C, below.\nOn the other hand, both of the high-T second-virial terms, B2,1 and B2,2 that are correctly\ngenerated by the ADH theory [see (2.26) and (2.27)], will be reproduced now if the zone\nfactors satisfy\n|z+ /z\u2212 |\n1\n+ O \u22172 ,\n1\n\u2217\nT (1 + 2 \u03b4+ )\nT\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n.\n+\nO\nF > (T ) = 1 + \u2217\nT (1 + 21 \u03b4\u2212 )\nT \u22172\n\u0012\n\nF < (T ) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nIn principle, F < and F > could be chosen to generate further exact second-virial terms; but\nsuch an approach does not seem of much practical value.\nB. Choice of Zone Factors\n\nUndoubtedly the simplest reasonable approximation for the zone factors is provided by\ntaking\nMF:\n\nF < (T ) = F > (T ) = 1,\n\n(3.7)\n\nor, equivalently, by dropping the term linear in \u03b2 in (2.5) and (2.7). The results will fail\nto reproduce the correct B2,2 coefficient in (2.27), although the exact B2,1 term will be\ngenerated. Physically, this approximation amounts to a direct mean-field or van-der-Waalstype approach in which the effects on the internal energy of the (T = \u221e) unbalanced zone\n<\n>\ncharges, Q<\nand Q>\n(where V < and V > are the zone volumes), are\n+ = q+ \u03c1+ V\n\u2212 = q\u2212 \u03c1\u2212 V\naccounted for in a direct way that neglects fluctuations. The zone charges remain finite and,\nin fact, fixed for all T : but, at least for small relative zone volumes V < /a3 \u2243 4\u03c0\u03b4+ (1 + \u03b4+ )\nand V > /a3 \u2243 4\u03c0\u03b4\u2212 (1 + \u03b4\u2212 ), one might reasonably expect that the initial thermodynamic\ntrends with increasing asymmetry \u03bb = a\u2212\u2212 /a++ , for small \u03bb, will be correctly predicted.\nA second natural step, following our initial discussion, is to take \u03c6\u2020 (r) to be the direct\npotential, q\u03c3 /Dr, evaluated at the mean radius of the border zones, namely, r < = 21 (a++ +\na) = (1 + 12 \u03b4+ )a and r > = (1 + 21 \u03b4\u2212 )a. This amounts to adopting\nEXP< :\n\n2\nF < (T ) = exp [\u2212\u03b2q+\n/Da(1 + 12 \u03b4+ )] ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nand similarly for F > (T ) but with the exponent\ny > = +\u03b2q+ q\u2212 /Da(1 + 21 \u03b4\u2212 ) .\n\n(3.9)\n\nIt is encouraging that these choices precisely satisfy (3.5) and (3.6) and so reproduce both\nB2,1 and B2,2 .\nAs regards the sub-border zone where, as discussed in Sec. II.B, one expects Q<\n+ (T, \u03c1) to\nvanish at low T (or, at least, approach very small values), the assignment (3.8) seems rather\nsatisfactory. Indeed, combining (3.1) and the first part of (2.29) shows that Q< will remain\npositive but decrease exponentially rapidly as the (+, +) repulsions \"flush out\" charge from\nthe sub-border zone.\n12\n\n\fIt is worth pointing out that the exponential treatment of the sub-border zone can be\nextended within the DH self-consistent spirit by linearizing the Poisson-Boltzmann factor in\n(2.5) about the central value of the direct potential in the sub-border zone. Thus, if \u2212y <\ndenotes the exponent in (3.8), while y = \u03b2q+ h\u03c6(r)i+ , one may replace (2.7) by\n<\n\nh\u03c1q (r)i+ \u2243 q+ \u03c1+ e\u2212y = q+ \u03c1+ e\u2212y e\u2212(y\u2212y\n\n<)\n\n<\n\n\u2243 q+ \u03c1+ e\u2212y [1 \u2212 (y \u2212 y < )] .\n\n(3.10)\n\n<\n\nThe overall factor e\u2212y should now ensure the sensible behavior of the sub-border zone\ncharge, Q<\n+ , while the linear factor y \u221d h\u03c1q (r)i+ accounts self-consistently for some fluctuation effects while still allowing integration of the closed ADH equations. We have not,\nhowever, examined this approach further.\nIn the super-border zone case, however, matters are significantly different. Certainly, as\nfollows from (3.6), one expects the mean border zone charge Q>\n\u2212 (T, \u03c1), which will be positive\nfor T = \u221e, to increase initially when T falls. This is simply because the Boltzmann factor\nenhances the attractions between the larger, central negative ion and the smaller positive\nions. Nevertheless, the growth of Q>\n\u2212 cannot continue indefinitely as would be implied by\nadopting the EXP> form with (3.9) for F > . Regardless of other effects, the hard cores of\nthe + ions must limit the number that can be packed into a super-border zone at any T :\nhence Q>\n\u2212 must saturate. This effect may be incorporated into the present framework via a\n>\nsaturation fraction, F\u221e\n= s, which prescribes the limiting T \u2192 0 super-border zone charge\ndensity as sq+ \u03c1+ ; recall (3.2). A plausible zone factor is then the \"regulated\" exponential\nform\n>\n\n>\n\nREGEXP :\n\ns ecy\n,\nF (T ) = cy>\ne \u22121+s\n>\n\n(3.11)\n\nwith c = s/(s \u2212 1), which satisfies (3.6) and approaches s for large y > (i.e., low T ). In the\nlimit s \u2192 1 (no growth in Q>\n\u2212 ) this reduces simply to the mean-field form (3.7).\nThe difficulty in utilizing this proposal, however, is to know what saturation value (s > 0)\nis appropriate. At low T , considerations of ion association indicate that the predicted\nsaturation charge in the super-zone, namely,\nQ>\n\u2212s\n\n2\n)\n\u03b4\u2212 (1 + \u03b4\u2212 + 13 \u03b4\u2212\n= V q+ \u03c1+ s = 4\u03c0q0\nz+ \u03c1\u2217 s ,\n1 + |z+ /z\u2212 |\n>\n\n(3.12)\n\nshould not exceed the neutralizing value |q\u2212 | = |z\u2212 |q0 . To meet this condition requires s \u221d\n1/\u03c1. While a density-dependent s and, hence, F > , can be accommodated without changing\n(3.4), the subsequent expressions for the free energy become more complex. Furthermore,\nwhen \u03c1\u2217 increases, s must decrease and may even fall below unity. In these circumstances\nand in the absence of other effective selection criteria we believe it is appropriate to accept\nthe mean-field form (3.7), i.e., to set F > \u2261 1 even though B2,2 will not then be correctly\nreproduced.\nIn passing we mention, nonetheless, that we have also explored algebraic forms which\nrespect (3.6) [20]. As an example, one can consider\nF > (T ) = (1 + y > )/[1 + (y > /s)2 ]\u03bd ,\n13\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fwhich saturates at F > = s (not necessarily greater than unity) when \u03bd = 21 but decays to 0\n> 2 such approximations have an added, unexpected feature,\nat low T when \u03bd > 12 . For s \u223c\nnamely, they tend to predict an additional asymmetric critical point at higher densities that\ndoes not smoothly connect to the standard DH critical point [9] when \u03bb \u2192 0. While, owing\nto the strong short-range interactions implicit in the asymmetric systems, such extra critical\npoints are not obviously unphysical (especially when the diameters are nonadditive), we will\nnot discuss the algebraic forms (3.13) (or EXP> ) further here.\nC. Behavior of Energy Isochores\n\nBefore examining the predictions of the modified ADH theories for criticality, it is instructive to examine energy isochores, such as those plotted in Fig. 3, for several densities\nnear the critical value: compare with the results for the simple ADH theory in Fig. 2(b) but\n< 0.2)\nnote the difference in vertical scales. At temperatures in the coexistence region (T \u2217 \u223c\n< 3 - 4), both the MF-ADH theory [specified by\nand for modest degrees of asymmetry (\u03bb \u223c\n<\n>\n(3.7)] and the EXP MF ADH theory [where F < has been replaced by (3.8)] predict that the\ninternal energy increases above the RPM value with increasing asymmetry. This reduction\nin thermodynamic stability suggests, as we will confirm, that the predicted values of Tc\u2217 fall\nas \u03bb increases.\nWe also find that the MF-ADH and EXP< MF> ADH theories do, indeed, satisfy the\nenergy bounds of Appendix A for all (\u03c1, T ) states relevant to the critical and coexistence\nregions in the additive case. Bound violations can occur, but these arise only at the highest\ndensities (\u03c1\u2217 \u2243 1) and when the asymmetry is great (\u03bb \u226b 1). While this behavior undermines the two modified ADH theories investigated as overall descriptions of the asymmetric\nprimitive model, the pathologies occur far from the critical region and at unphysically large\nasymmetry levels.\nFor moderate to large asymmetry and high density, however, we find that the MF-ADH\nand EXP< MF> ADH isochores exhibit nonmonotonic behavior in T , indicating a thermodynamic instability as previously found in a variety of ion-pairing theories [10]. For both\nthe MF-ADH and EXP< MF> ADH theories, these convexity violations occur for additive\n> 1. No convexity violations are found for\nmodels (\u03b4\u2212 = \u2212\u03b4+ ), roughly, only when \u03b4\u2212 + \u03c1\u2217 \u223c\n<\n\u03bb \u223c 2 at any physical density (recalling the packing limit): this confirms the view that the\npresent theories are of greatest validity for modest asymmetries.\n\n14\n\n\fIV. PREDICTIONS FOR CRITICAL PARAMETERS\n\nThe discussions presented above of the various proposed modifications of the asymmetric\nDH theory indicate that simpler versions should provide a reasonable basis for further exploration, at least in the case of small size asymmetries. Accordingly, we present here, first,\nby way of calibration, the predictions of (i) the original, 1923 DH theory embodied in (2.31);\n(ii) the MF-ADH theory which uses the simple, mean-field border-zone factors (3.7); and\n(iii) the EXP< MF> ADH theory which retains the mean-field treatment for the super-border\nzones but recognizes, via (3.8), the decrease in sub-border zone charge resulting from the\nBoltzmann-factor enhanced like-charge repulsions.\nThe predictions for Tc\u2217 (\u03bb) and \u03c1\u2217c (\u03bb) for a 1:1 electrolyte are embodied in Fig. 4. The\nasymmetry variable \u03c9(\u03bb) = (1\u2212\u03bb)2 /(1+\u03bb2 ) is convenient [14] since it respects the symmetry\n\u03bb \u2194 1/\u03bb. Note that \u03c9(2) = 0.20, \u03c9(3) = 0.40, and \u03c9(4.79) = 0.60, while the point charge\nlimit (\u03bb = \u221e) gives \u03c9 = 1.\nIn Fig. 4 no hard-core terms have been included in the free energy [9]. Thus for the RPM\n1\n(\u03bb = 1, \u03c9 = 0) one has Tc\u2217 DH = 16\n= 0.0625 [7,9], which may be compared with simulation\n\u2217\nestimates yielding Tc \u2243 0.049 (see [7]). The DH prediction for the critical density is very\nlow, namely, \u03c1\u2217c DH = 1/64\u03c0 \u2243 0.00497 [9]; however, this increases to around \u03c1\u2217c \u2243 0.03 when\nBjerrum ion pairing is introduced [7,9]. Inclusion of hard-core effects, say via a CarnahanStarling form, reduces all these parameters by a few percent [9] - and the same is expected\nto happen for the ADH-based theories.\nWe note immediately from Fig. 4 that the original DH theory (i) predicts that both Tc\u2217 (\u03bb)\nand \u03c1\u2217c (\u03bb) rise rapidly with \u03bb. These are precisely the trends found by the MSA (using the\nenergy route) [12] and by the MSA with Bjerrum-Ebeling-Grigo pairing [13]. The modified\nPoisson-Boltzmann approximations of [11] likewise predict that \u03c1\u2217c increases. (See also Fig.\n3 in [14].) In these approximations, however, the initial \u03bb = 1 values are well known to be\nsignificantly higher [ Tc\u2217 (1) \u2243 0.08, \u03c1\u2217c (1) \u2243 0.015 to 0.03 ]; nevertheless, the proportionate\nrate of increases are roughly comparable.\nBy contrast, both of the modified ADH theories predict a strong decrease in Tc\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217c\nwhen \u03bb increases from unity: see plots (ii) and (iii). Furthermore, these decreases are in\naccord with the simulations [14,15] (which, however, start from Tc\u2217 (1) \u2243 0.049 and \u03c1\u2217c (1) \u2243\n0.07) and the relative rates of fall are quite comparable. For the MF-ADH theory (ii) the\ncritical temperature decreases monotonically and we find Tc\u2217 (\u03bb = \u221e) \u2243 0.049 in the point\ncharge limit (a++ \u2192 0), while \u03c1c exhibits a shallow minimum at \u03bb \u2243 4 and then increases\nto \u03c1\u2217c (\u03bb = \u221e) \u2243 0.006. By comparison, extrapolation of the simulations (beyond \u03bb \u2243 6)\nsuggests, roughly, Tc\u2217 (\u221e) \u2243 0.022 and \u03c1\u2217c (\u221e) \u2243 0.015 [14].\nIn the case of the EXP< MF> ADH theory (iii), however, while Tc\u2217 (\u03bb) falls monotonically\nto about 0.053 when \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, the critical density undergoes a shallow minimum around\n\u03bb \u2243 1.8 and then rises. Insofar as the simulations seem trustworthy, and exhibit plots which\ncurve downwards (i.e., are concave) vs. \u03c9(\u03bb), it is surprising that the use of the EXP< choice\nfor F < leads to apparently inferior predictions. Indeed, on a priori theoretical grounds, the\nlatter would seem superior to the MF assignment F < = 1. We emphasize again, therefore,\nthat various steps in our analysis appear most soundly based when \u03bb is not too large.\nFor completeness, we report that the MF-ADH and EXP< MF> ADH theories predict\nthat the critical ratio Zc = pc /\u03c1c kB T falls monotonically with \u03bb from 0.09036 at \u03bb = 1 [9],\n15\n\n\fwhile the original DH theory (Sec. II.C) predicts a fall of just a few percent followed, for\n> 2, by a monotonic rise. Inclusion of hard-core terms in the free energy increases these\n\u03bb\u223c\nvalues (by about 7 %) but otherwise the behavior remains similar.\n\n16\n\n\fV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have extended Debye-H\u00fcckel (DH) theory to asymmetric two-component hard-sphere\nelectrolytes (i.e., \"primitive models\") and computed the predicted critical temperatures and\ndensities. We also have derived, in Appendix A, a lower bound on the internal energy\nthat extends Onsager's bound [18] and depends only on the product of the valences |z+ z\u2212 |\nand the unlike \"collision diameter\" a+\u2212 . In order to extend the original DH theory [1]\n(based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation) to the case of size-asymmetric ions with, say,\na\u2212\u2212 > a++ , we have identified \"border zones\" around ions of both species, which prove to\nbe of essential importance. These zones are charge-unbalanced even at infinite temperature\nbecause the larger (negative) ions are geometrically excluded while the smaller (positive)\nions may always enter: see Fig. 1.\nDH extensions which describe the border zones in a physical way (Sec. III) prove successful in matching trends - as determined by two independent simulation studies [14,15] - in\nthe critical temperature and density with increasing size asymmetry (see Fig. 4 and Sec. IV).\nThis contrasts favorably with other theories, including several based on the mean spherical\napproximation [11\u201313], which predict trends opposite to those revealed unequivocally by the\nsimulations.\nThe existence of the zones complicates the theory in an essential way; however, the usual\nDH approach can be extended straightforwardly and yields explicit approximations for the\ninternal energy (and, thence, results for other thermodynamic properties). This asymmetric\nDH (or ADH) theory reproduces the limiting laws and provides the exact high-temperature\nsecond-virial coefficients, B2,1 and B2,2 [see (2.25)-(2.27)], down to the point-ion limit.\nHowever, in contrast to the standard DH theory for the symmetric restricted primitive\nmodel (RPM) with \u03bb = a\u2212\u2212 /a++ = 1, the straightforward ADH theory violates the (extended) lower bound on the internal energy in the coexistence region when \u03bb > 5. Even\nmore seriously, for moderate asymmetries and moderate temperatures, the mean charge in\na \"sub-border\" zone (that surrounds a + ion) is predicted to change sign and, at low T ,\nto diverge; but, by construction of the model, such behavior is physically impossible! This\npathology is readily traced to use of the standard DH linearization of the Boltzmann factor\nwithin the border zones: see Sec. II.B. Modifications of the ADH theory are thus essential\nfor applications at low T .\nAs shown in Sec. III, one may restore physically sensible behavior while retaining the\nexact high-T behavior by introducing \"border zone factors\", F < (T ) and F > (T ), originally\nproposed in [17]. (This also ensures that the energy bounds are no longer violated in the critical region and beyond.) The simplest such modification amounts to a mean-field approach\nin which the Poisson-Boltzmann factors in the border zones (only) are merely replaced by\ntheir T = \u221e limits, namely, unity. For a sub-border zone (around a smaller + ion) a theoretically preferable approach, dubbed EXP< , replaces the self-consistent Poisson-Boltzmann\nfactor by a mean bare-interaction Boltzmann factor [or, better, linearizes about such a mean\nvalue: see (3.10)]. A corresponding exponential treatment of the super-border zone (around\na negative ion) proves, however, more problematical owing to physically crucial chargesaturation effects that are hard to elucidate in a precise way. One may expect that both the\nmean-field and EXP< modifications of linear ADH theory are most reliable at small degrees\nof asymmetry.\n17\n\n\fTo explore the consequences of the simplest modified mean-field and EXP< ADH theories\n(just sketched) we have computed the predicted critical parameters as a function of the sizeasymmetry \u03bb for 1:1 electrolytes [with additive interactions, a+\u2212 = 21 (a++ + a\u2212\u2212 )]: see Fig.\n4. As \u03bb increases from unity, the predicted Tc\u2217 (\u03bb) and \u03c1\u2217c (\u03bb) fall systematically within both\nof these modified ADH theories. [See (1.4) and (1.5) for definitions of the reduced units.]\nThese decreases accord well with recent simulations [14,15]. On the other hand, an original\nproposal by Debye and H\u00fcckel in 1923, that completely ignores the border zones (see Sec.\nIII.C), predicts diametrically opposite trends. Furthermore, current, more sophisticated\ntheories [12,13] make similar predictions of increasing Tc\u2217 and \u03c1\u2217c (in addition to yielding\nexcessively large values of Tc\u2217 for the RPM [7,9]).\nWe conclude that DH-based theories seem to extract the basic physics in a quantitatively\nmore reliable way [7,9], even for size-asymmetric systems, than do potentially better, but\nphysically less transparent approaches like the MSA. It is still necessary, however [10], to\nincorporate Bjerrum ion-pairing and dipole-ion solvation [9] into the modified ADH theories\nexpounded here. (This will also increase the predicted critical densities to better match the\nanticipated values.) It is not obvious that the correct trends with asymmetry (accepting the\nvalidity of the simulations [14,15]) will survive these extensions: it seems likely, nonetheless,\nthat the proper dependence on asymmetry will be preserved (as suggested, e.g., by comparing\nthe results of [12] and [13]).\nFrom a broader perspective, it remains frustrating that more powerful and definitive\ntheoretical techniques have not yet been devised to aid in our understanding of such a\nfundamental and significant model for condensed matter.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe appreciate the interest, encouragement, and comments of Professors Benjamin P.\nVollmayr-Lee, Elliot Lieb, and A.

II and also develop an (apparently new) lower bound\nwhich improves on the simple Onsager result.\nThe quantity to be bounded is the interaction energy of the ions, U int . Defining the\ninterionic distances, rij , and interaction potentials,\n\u03c6ij = qi qj /Drij ,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere qi is the charge on the ith ion, one has\nU int =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6ij .\n\n(A2)\n\ni<j\n\nBy adopting the 1/rij form in (A1), we implicitly assume that the charge densities between\nany two ions are spherically symmetric and never overlap. To avoid irrelevant singularities, we further assume that the charge density is everywhere finite, i.e., has been suitable\n\"smeared\" or distributed.\nFollowing Onsager [18], consider the total electrostatic energy, U tot , which, besides the\ninteraction energy, also includes the self energies, uself\ni , i.e., the energies required to assemble\nthe individual ions from an infinitely dispersed charge state of zero energy. As is well known\n(see, e.g., [21]), the total energy may be expressed in terms of the electric field, E, as a\npositive definite quantity, namely,\nU\n\ntot\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03c6ij +\n\ni<j\n\nX\n\n1\n=\n8\u03c0\n\nuself\ni\n\nZ\n\nd3 r |E|2 > 0.\n\n(A3)\n\nNote that the smeared charge distributions assumed guarantee the finiteness of U tot .\n1. Generalization of the Onsager Bound\n\nThe Onsager bound for the RPM and its direct generalization follow easily from (A3).\nRearrangement leads to\nX\ni<j\n\n\u03c6ij \u2265 \u2212\n\nX\n\nuself\ni .\n\n(A4)\n\ni\n\nThis inequality holds for arbitrary charge distributions obeying the restrictions stated above;\ndifferent distributions, of course, lead to different values of uself\ni . To obtain the strongest\nbound, we must minimize the magnitudes of the self energies. This is accomplished by\ndispersing the ionic charge as much as possible, namely, by placing it in a thin shell on the\nsurface of the largest permissible sphere (of diameter amax ). Considering a vanishingly thin\nshell, the minimal self energy is thus\n2\nmax\nmin {uself\n.\ni } = qi /Dai\n\n19\n\n(A5)\n\n\fFor the symmetric RPM, the equality of charges, q+ = \u2212q\u2212 \u2261 q, and of sizes, amax\n\u2261 a+\u2212 \u2261\ni\n2\na, immediately leads to the Onsager bound q /Da. In the case of non-additivity, however,\none must avoid overlapping charge distributions from distinct ions, so that\namax\n= min {a+\u2212 , aii } .\ni\n\n(A6)\n\nWe can now formulate the explicit Onsager bound. First, defining z = |z+ /z\u2212 |, note that\nthe total numbers of particles of each species are\nN+ = N/(1 + z)\n\nand\n\nN\u2212 = zN/(1 + z) .\n\n(A7)\n\nRecalling the definition of the reduced energy (1.6) and using the constraint of overall charge\nneutrality, one finds the bound, namely,\nu(\u03c1, T ) \u2265 uOns = \u2212\n\nmax\nz(a/amax\n+ ) + (a/a\u2212 )\n.\n1+z\n\n(A8)\n\nNote that for the size-symmetric case, where amax\n= amax\n= a, the charge asymmetry does\n+\n\u2212\nnot affect the bound in these reduced units, so that u(\u03c1, T ) \u2265 uOns = \u22121. If we separate the\nthree basic size asymmetry cases, the result (A8) translates into\nuIOns = \u2212{z/[(1 + \u03b4+ )(1 + z)] + 1/[(1 + \u03b4\u2212 )(1 + z)]} ,\nuII\nOns = \u2212{z/[(1 + \u03b4+ )(1 + z)] + 1/(1 + z)} ,\nuIII\nOns = \u22121 ,\n\nfor a++ , a\u2212\u2212 < a\nfor a++ < a < a\u2212\u2212\nfor a < a++ , a\u2212\u2212 .\n\n(A9)\n\nNote that the strongest bound is -1, which obtains for Case III, when the like-diameters\nboth exceed a, which matches the RPM result. On the other hand, uOns is weaker in Cases I\nor II, since the bound can then diverge to \u2212\u221e when \u03b4\u03c3 \u2192 \u22121 (or, equivalently, as a\u03c3\u03c3 \u2192 0).\nPhysically, shrinking the like-diameters (but keeping a+\u2212 positive) should not decrease the\nenergy: thus a stronger bound is desirable.\n2. Improved Bound\n\nTo do better we compare the two-species primitive model with another model whose\nenergy can be bounded by an Onsager construction, specifically, an interpenetrating, twospecies shell model, consisting of a charge-neutral mixture of uniformly surface-charged\nspheres of total charges qi = z+ q0 or z\u2212 q0 and equal diameters a, but with no hard-core\nconstraint. The shell diameter a will be identified with a+\u2212 for the primitive models. The\ninteraction potential is described further below.\nSince the configuration space of the primitive model - in terms of ion-center locations\n- is a subset of the space of the shell model, any ground state configuration of the primitive\nmodel of energy, say U0int , is present in the shell model with energy, say U1int , which cannot\nint\nbe lower than the shell model ground state, say U0,S\n. Thus, if we can establish\nU0int \u2265 U1int\n\n(A10)\n\nint\nand also show that U0,S\nis bounded below, we will obtain a lower bound on U int , as desired.\n\n20\n\n\fWe may construct the interaction potential of the interpenetrating shell model, say \u03c6\u0303ij\n(which does not behave as 1/rij at all separations), as the difference between the total energy\nof a two-particle system and the sum of the two self energies. Thus if \u03c1\u0302k (r; rk ) represents\nthe charge distribution of a shell ion k centered at rk , and\n\u03c1\u0302(r) \u2261 \u03c1\u0302i (r; ri ) + \u03c1\u0302j (r; rj )\n\n(A11)\n\nis the total charge density for two ions, the interaction potential follows from\n\u03c6\u0303ij +\n\nZ\nZ\nq2\nqi2\n1\nd3 r |E|2 = 12 d3 r \u03c1\u0302(r)\u03c6(r) ,\n+ j =\nDa Da\n8\u03c0\n\n(A12)\n\nwhere E(r; ri , rj ) and \u03c6(r; ri , rj ) are the total field and electrostatic potential. If we now\ndefine \u03c6k (r; rk ) to be the electrostatic potential resulting from an isolated shell ion k at rk ,\nwe have\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 r \u03c1\u0302k (r; rk )\u03c6k (r; rk ) =\n\nqk2\n.\nDa\n\n(A13)\n\nThen, using the linearity of the charge density and potential, the relation (A12) may be\nsimplified to yield\n\u03c6\u0303ij \u2261 \u03c6\u0303(rij ) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 r [\u03c1\u0302i (r; ri )\u03c6j (r; rj ) + \u03c1\u0302j (r; rj )\u03c6i (r; ri )] .\n\n(A14)\n\nTo compare the energy of an arbitrary primitive-ion configuration with that of the corresponding shell-ion configuration in order to establish (A10), we observe first that because of\nthe pairwise additivity of the interaction energy (A2), one need analyze only two shell ions\nof the same charge which overlap. To see this, note that all (+, \u2212) ion pairs in a primitive\nmodel are separated by distance not less than a+\u2212 = a, which is the same diameter as the\nshell ions. Thus, oppositely charged shell ions that correspond to a primitive ion configuration never overlap. The only differences arise when, in the primitive ion system, one or\nboth of the like diameters, a\u03c3\u03c3 , is smaller than a. This will allow overlapping shells in the\ncorresponding shell configurations. If a++ and a\u2212\u2212 exceed a, the energy of corresponding\nprimitive and shell configurations will always be identical.\nConsider then, for concreteness, two positive overlapping shells, separated by a distance\nr++ , with a++ < r++ < a; see Fig. 5. We want to show that the interaction energy of\nthis pair, \u03c6\u0303(r++ ), is less than that for the the corresponding non-overlapping primitive ions\n2\nwhich is simply q+\n/Dr++ .\nBy symmetry the two terms in (A14) are now identical. Thus, consider the charge\ndistribution of the right-hand shell in Fig. 5 in the potential of that on the left; the right-hand\ndistribution divides naturally into the two parts shown in the figure: a part exterior to the\nleft-hand shell (bold) and an interior part (dashed). If rl denotes the position of the left-hand\nion, the resulting potential at an exterior points, r> , is simply q+ /|rl \u2212 r> | (because these\npoints \"see\" a spherically symmetric left-hand charge distribution). Conversely, interior\npoints, such as r< , experience only the constant electrostatic potential q+ /(a/2). This is\nclearly less than the potential they would experience were all the left-hand charge distributed\non the smaller primitive ion sphere with the same center, rl . Consequently, overlapping likecharged shell ions have a smaller interaction potential than the corresponding primitive ions\nwith the same centers. This establishes (A10).\n21\n\n\fTo obtain a lower bound for the shell model itself, recall (A3) and (A11) and bound the\ntotal energy of any shell configuration as\n1\nd3 r |E|2 =\n8\u03c0\nZ\n\nUStot =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 r \u03c1\u0302(r)\u03c6(r) > 0 ,\n\n(A15)\n\nwhere the total shell charge density, \u03c1\u0302(r) can be expressed in the form (A11) but with a sum\nextending over all the shell ions. The total electrostatic potential, \u03c6(r), can be decomposed\nsimilarly, yielding\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\nd3 r \u03c1\u0302(r)\u03c6(r) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\nd3 r [\u03c1\u03021 (r) + * * * + \u03c1\u0302N (r)] [\u03c61 (r) + * * * + \u03c6N (r)] .\n\n(A16)\n\nFinally, by combining the previously defined shell self energies, (A13), and interaction potentials in (A14), the inequality (A15) may be re-arranged to give\nU int\n1 X\n1\nUSint\n=\n\u03c6\u0303ij \u2265 0,S \u2265 \u2212\nN\nN i<j\nN\nN\n\n2\n2\nN\u2212 q\u2212\nN+ q+\n+\nDa\nDa\n\n!\n\n=\u2212\n\n|q+ q\u2212 |\n.\nDa\n\n(A17)\n\nThe bound on the primitive model is now completed by combining this with (A10). In\nterms of the reduced energy per particle, (1.6), the result may be written\nu(\u03c1, T ) \u2265 \u22121 .\n\n(A18)\n\nNote that the positive definite collision diameter, a+\u2212 \u2261 a, and the valences z\u03c3 do not appear\nexplicitly here since they enter into the definition (1.6). Since a++ and a\u2212\u2212 are also absent,\nthe bound remains valid for point ions (a\u03c3\u03c3 \u2192 0).\n\n22\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] P.W. Debye and E. H\u00fcckel, Phys.

Effects of size asymmetry on high- and low-temperature energy isochores, according to\nthe linear ADH theory for a 1:1 primitive model. For each density, the RPM isochores\n(with \u03bb \u2261 a\u2212\u2212 /a++ = 1) are shown as solid curves. The associated, successively lower\nplots correspond to \u03bb = 2 (dashed), 4 (dot-dashed), and 6 (dotted, for \u03c1\u2217 = 0.1 only). The\ndensity-dependent, T \u2217 \u2192 \u221e limiting values are exact. (The near-agreement between two of\nthe curves at T \u2217 = \u221e is a coincidence.)\n3.
