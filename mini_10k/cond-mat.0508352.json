However, measurements\nof this increased stability often conflict with theory and with each other [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\nA friction-based Mohr-Coulomb model has been\ndeveloped [3, 8]. However, it distinguishes between granular friction and inter-particle friction,\nand uses the former without providing a physical mechanism. Albert, et al. [2] analyzed the\ngeometric stability of grains on a pile's surface.\nThe frictionless model for dry particles is in excellent agreement with experiment. But, their\nmodel for wet grains overestimates stability and\npredicts no dependence on system size. Using the\nfrictionless model and performing stability analysis within the pile, we reproduce the dependence\nof the stability angle on system size, particle size,\nand surface tension observed in our experiments.\nAdditionally, we account for past discrepancies in\nexperimental reports by showing that sidewalls\ncan significantly increase the stability of granular\nmaterial.\nThe experimental apparatus consists of a clear plexiglass drum which is rotated about an horizontal axis. We\nprimarily use a drum with a diameter D of 28.5 cm and\na width W which can be varied from 0 cm to 14.5 cm. A\ndrum with D = 12.5 cm and W = 11.5 cm is also used\nto vary system size. The rotation rate \u03c9 is varied from\n9.0\u00d710\u22124 rpm to 5.6\u00d710\u22121 rpm. Soda-lime glass spheres\nwhich have a density \u03c1 of 2.4 g cm\u22123 , and with radius r =\n0.25 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, and 1.5 mm and size dispersity\nwithin 0.1 mm were used. The drum was 40% filled with\ngrains premixed with a small amount of liquid. We report the amount of liquid added in terms of the volume\nfraction, Vf , which is defined as the volume of the liquid divided by the volume occupied by the grains alone.\nThe effect of surface tension of the liquid \u0393 was tested\nby using silicone oil and water which have \u0393 = 20 \u00b1 1\ndyne cm\u22121 and \u0393 = 70 \u00b1 1 dyne cm\u22121 , respectively. Silicone oil with viscosity \u03bd ranging from 5 cS to 1000 cS\nis used to study its impact on the measured inclination\nangles.\nThe drum is back lit so that light could pass through a\nthin layer of grains that tends to accumulate on the sides\nof the drum, but is unable to pass through the bulk of\nthe pile.

(a) Stick-slip flow is observed for a rotation rate \u03c9\nof 0.028 rpm and viscosity \u03bd = 5 cS. (b) Continuous flow is\nobserved for rotation rate of 0.28 rpm.\n\nand used to determine the surface slope with automated\ncode. At this rate, the slope of the pile changed no more\nthan 0.2 degrees between frames. This error in measurement is not significant given that the slope of the pile at\nthe moment of avalanche was distributed over about two\ndegrees in a given run. At least 30 events were recorded\nto measure the mean values.\nA stick-slip avalanche regime or a continuous avalanche\nregime is observed depending on the rotation rate of the\ndrum and the liquid viscosity [see Fig. 1(a,b)]. In the\nstick-slip regime, the slope of the pile increases linearly\nwith time until the heap reaches the maximum angle \u03b8m .\nAt this point, the grains are observed to avalanche and\nthe pile's angle decreases to the angle of repose, \u03b8r when\navalanching stops. In the continuous avalanche regime,\nthe grains were observed to flow continuously and the\nslope of the pile is approximately constant over time. By\nchanging \u03c9 and \u03bd, one can go from the stick-slip to continuous avalanche regime. \u03b8m in the stick-slip regime is\nobserved to be independent of \u03c9 and \u03bd within the fluctuations in the data and thus rate independent. On the\nother hand, \u03b8r and the surface angle in the continuous\navalanche do depend on the viscosity, consistent with previous observations [6]. The overall behavior as a function\n\u03c9 is similar to previous systematic investigations with a\nrotated drum [7], but the magnitudes are significantly\n\n\fSurface angle (deg.)\n\n2\n(a)\n30\n25\n\nL\n\n\u03b8m\n\u03b8r\n\n20\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n30\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nc\n\u03c6\n\n(a)\n\nexpt.\na0 exp(- b 0W)+c0\n\n35\n\na b\nd\n\n6x10-3\n\n5\n\n(b)\n\n40\n\n\u03b8 m (deg.)\n\nVf\n\nx\n\n\u03b8m\n\u03b8\n\u03b8d\ndx\n\n14\n\n16\n\nW (cm)\n\nFIG. 2: Impact of liquid volume fraction and drum\nwidth on stability (a) Measured surface angles as a function\nof Vf of silicone oil.

(b) a geometrical arrangement of a sphere\nresting on top of three spheres in contact used in the stability analysis. Liquid bridges located at the points of contact\nintroduce forces along the segments joining the vertices abcd\nof the tetrahedron at which the spheres are centered.\n\n\u03b8m of at least 90 degrees is predicted by Albert, et\nal. [2] if the ratio of the capillary to gravitational force,\nwhich is also called the bond number (Bo [5]), is of order\none or greater. Now the capillary force due to the liquid\nbridge bond is given by:\nFc = \u03b1\u03c0\u0393r\n\nlower.\nWe note that empirically, as function of Vf , \u03b8m increases sharply, and saturates when Vf is on the order\n1 \u00d7 103 , \u03b8m [See figure 2(a)]. The dependence of the angles on Vf is again qualitatively consistent with previous\nstudies [6, 7], but as noted earlier the overall increase\nand saturation is significantly lower. At very small Vf ,\n\u03b8m can be quite sensitive to Vf because of the inherent\nroughness of the grains and its impact on the shape of the\nliquid bridge [1]. We performed our experiments in the\nsaturation regime, so that such effects are eliminated, but\nwe also chose a small enough Vf that the liquid does not\ndrain to the bottom due to gravity, which would cause\nspatial inhomogeneity.\nWe experimentally determined that higher angles can\nbe attributed to significant wall effects when narrow\nwidths are used as in most previous investigations. For\nexample, the angles reported in Ref. [7] are 15-20 degrees\nhigher than those we report for similar r and \u0393, but the\napparatus was 3.2 cm wide. The observed dependence on\nW is plotted in Fig. 2(b) and is described by an exponential fit. The effect of side walls on grains which are fully\nimmersed in a liquid has been reported in Ref. [9]. The\ndata in that case reaches the asymptotic value for a W of\na few grain diameters because liquid bridges are absent.\nHowever, the side walls have an effect over many hundred times the diameter of the particle in the partially\nsaturated case because of the added particle-particle correlations induced by the liquid bridges. In order to simplify the analysis, we examine the data only in the limit\nW > 11.5 cm where the side walls are unimportant.\n\n(b)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, \u03b1 is a dimensionless constant which depends on\nthe size and shape of the liquid bridge between the particles, and their separation [10, 11]. Although there is some\nambiguity on the value of \u03b1, it is of order 1, and therefore\nBo is approximately 5 for glass beads with r = 0.5 mm\nmixed with silicone oil at Vf = 0.008. We do not observe\n\u03b8m reach 90 degree; the piles typically avalanche when\n\u03b8 exceeds 30 degrees as can be noted from Fig. 1. We\nbelieve that the discrepancy arises from the assumption\nthat a wet granular pile fails at the surface, as was also\nnoted previously in Ref. [3].\nFollowing Albert, et al. [2], let us consider the stability\nof a sphere placed on top of three base spheres which are\nall in contact with each other (see Fig. 3). In the absence\nof liquid bridges, the sphere becomes unstable when gravitation force is outside the triangle formed by the base\nspheres. By averaging over all possible orientation angle \u03c6 of the base triangle between 0 and 60 degree, they\nshowed that the average inclination \u03b8d (the geometric,\nor dry angle of stability) is 23.8 degrees. At this angle,\napproximately half of the triangular bases at the surface\ncan support a sphere and thus the pile will be stable.\nMeasurements with dry glass, plastic or steel spheres in\na rotated drum all show \u03b8m which are within a few degrees of their prediction, and thus it appears that the\ncomplications associated with random packing and friction between particles need not be taken into account to\nobtain reasonable results.\nNext, let us again consider a sphere resting on three\nbase spheres as in Fig. 3(b) which is located at a distance\nx and angle \u03b8 from the bottom of the inclined surface.

Now\nwe assume that on an average, it is the component of the\nliquid bridge bond ab directed up the inclined plane tilted\nat \u03b8 which is responsible for offsetting the unbalanced\ngravitation component down the plane. (We neglect the\ncontributions of the bonds ac and ad because they are\nmostly directed towards the axis around which the top\nsphere rotates when it becomes unstable.)\nBecause abcd forms a tetrahedron, the projection of the\nforce Fc up the plane of the base triangle due to the liquid\nbridge between ab can be easily determined. The average\ncomponent of the liquid bond force corresponding to the\naverage\u221aorientation angle \u03c6 of the base triangle is given\nby Fc / 24 tan \u03b8d which is approximately 0.46Fc . Therefore the shear stress that can be supported by the liquid\nbridges along the \u03b8 plane is given by the force per sphere\ncalculated times the average number of spheres per unit\narea. Now, the number of particles per unit volume is\n3fp /4\u03c0r3 , where fp is the packing fraction of the grains\nwhich is approximately 0.64 for spherical grains. Therefore the number of particles per unit area is equal to the\nnumber of particles per unit volume to the 32 power. We\nthen have the shear stress as:\n\u00132/3\n\u0012\n3fp\nFc\n\u221a\n,\n(2)\n24 tan \u03b8d 4\u03c0r3\nwhere, Fc is given by eq. (1).\nNow let us calculate the shear stress due to the un-\n\n(4)\n\nTo simplify further discussion, we take the small angle\napproximation, and obtain the unbalanced stress to be\nx\u03c1gfp (\u03b8m \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8d )/ cos \u03b8d .\n\n(5)\n\nNow for each x it can be shown that this shear stress is\nmaximum for \u03b8 = \u03b8m 2+\u03b8d . This is simply because as one\ngoes above \u03b8d on one hand there is less materials above,\nbut on the other hand the volume element is tilted further\noff equilibrium.\nNext, it is not clear if the pile will fail when the shear\nstress from the weight first exceeds the stress provided by\nthe liquid bridges, or when the average shear stress due to\nthe weight of the pile exceeds the stress provided by the\nliquid bridges. In reality, the correct physical situation is\nmost likely combination of these two. Therefore, we set\nx = \u03b2L in eq. (5) when balancing the stresses, where \u03b2\nis a dimensionless constant between 0.5 and 1. \u03b2 = 1, if\nadjacent volume elements cannot offset any stress by a\nparticular volume element, and \u03b2 = 0.5, if the stress is\nevenly distributed along the slip plane. Given the variance seen in the stick-slip events [see Fig. 1(a)], and the\nheterogeneity of pile at the granular level, \u03b2 may vary\nfrom event to event.\nCombining these facts and balancing the two stress\ncomponents, we obtain the condition for equilibrium as\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8m \u2212 \u03b8d\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n9\u03c0\n16fp\n\n\u0013 31 \u0012\n\n\u03b1 cos \u03b8d \u0393\n\u221a\n24 tan \u03b8d \u03c1gr\u03b2L\n\n\u0013\n\nand, setting \u03b10 = \u03b1/\u03b2, we obtain\ns\n\u0013\n\u00131 \u0012\n\u0012\n9\u03c0 3\n\u03b10 cos \u03b8d \u0393\n\u221a\n.\n\u03b8m \u2212 \u03b8d =\n2fp\n6 tan \u03b8d \u03c1grL\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nFigure 4(a) shows a comparison of the measured \u03b8m as\na function of particle size r and the fit to eq. (7) after\nconversion of units to degrees. The data is well described\nby using \u03b10 = 1.2 \u00b1 0.05. To further test the model, we\nmeasured \u03b8m in two different sized systems (L = 27 cm\nand L = 12.5 cm) with various combinations of \u0393 and r.\nFig. 4(b) shows a plot of the experimentally measured \u03b8m\n\n\f4\nabove \u03b8d compared with eq. (7), with \u03b10 = 1.2. Excellent\noverall agreement is observed.\nWe note that the small angle approximation used to\nsimplify eq. (4) is reasonable over the angles tested. The\nanalysis can be extended to higher angles without using this approximation, but \u03b8m has to be obtained by a\nnumerical solution of the corresponding equation. In developing our analysis, we have ignored the contribution\nof friction which will also help stabilize the wet pile, but\njust as in the dry case, we may expect the friction contribution to be small as a grain rolls as it gets dislodged\nfrom the triangular base. A more detailed knowledge of\nhow the failure develops may clarify this issue.\nIn conclusion, our analysis captures the observed stability dependence on grain size, system size, and surface\ntension. It would be of great interest to consider how well\nthis analysis extends to piles composed of non-spherical\nand multi-sized grains as in natural sand.\n\n[1] Hornbaker, D., Albert, R., Albert, I., Barabasi, A., and\nSchiffer, P.
