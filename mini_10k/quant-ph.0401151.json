The phase diagrams can be well understood in\nterms of polarons, which correspond to atoms that are \"dressed\" by screening clouds of the other\natom species. For a mixture of single species of fermionic and bosonic atoms we find a charge\ndensity wave phase, a phase with fermion pairing, and a regime of phase separation.

Equivalence between the Luttinger liquid description of polarons and the\ncanonical polaron transformation is established and the techniques to detect the resulting quantum\nphases are discussed.\n\nMixtures of ultra-cold bosonic and fermionic atoms,\nthat have recently become accessible experimentally, represent a promising new system for studying strongly correlated many-body physics [1]. Bosonic atoms mediate\ninteractions between fermions and allow efficient cooling of the system [2]. Several novel phenomena have\nbeen predicted theoretically for Boson-Fermion mixtures\n(BFM) including pairing of fermions [3], formation of\ncomposite particles [4], spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in optical lattices [5] and appearance\nof charge density wave (CDW) [6]. Most of these theoretical studies relied on integrating out bosonic degrees\nof freedom to obtain an effective interaction between\nfermions, and then using a mean-field approach to investigate many-body states [3]. This approach, however,\nbecomes unreliable in the regime of strong interactions.\nIn particular, it fails in low-dimensional systems due to\nenhanced fluctuations and non-perturbative effects of interactions.\nIn this paper we use bosonization method [8, 9] to\ninvestigate one dimensional (1D) BFM. The resulting\nquantum phases can be understood by introducing polarons, i.e. atoms of one species surrounded by screening clouds of the other species. Such dressed quasiparticles exhibit effective interactions and modified effective masses. In our analysis the polarons emerge as quasiparticles with the slowest decaying correlation functions\nwhile quantum phases of the system arise from a competition of various ordering instabilities of such polarons.\nThe phase diagrams we obtain (Figs. 1-3) show a remarkable similarity to the Luttinger liquid phase diagrams of\n1D interacting electron systems [11], suggesting that 1D\nBFM may be understood as Luttinger liquids of polarons.\nIn Fig. 1 we show a phase diagram for a mixture\nof bosons and spinless fermions as a function of experimentally controlled parameters: the scattering length\nbetween bosons and fermions (abf ) and the strength of\nthe longitudinal optical lattice for bosonic atoms (Vb,k )\n[12].

In the\ncase of very strong boson-fermion interactions the system is unstable to phase separation (PS) [13, 14]. The\ntwo regimes are separated by a p-wave pairing phase of\nfermionic polarons (f -PP). While we carry out the detailed analysis for atoms in optical lattices, qualitatively\nit also applies to the continuous case [1, 2, 10].\nBefore proceeding we note that bosonization approach\nhas been applied to BFM in Ref.[13]. However this work\ndid not consider correlations of polaronic degrees of freedom, and as a result did not predict most of the quantum\nphases. The present system also resembles 1D electronphonon systems discussed previously in Ref.[18]. The key\ndifference between the two is that the sound velocity in\na solid state is typically smaller than the Fermi velocity,\nwhereas for the dilute fermionic gas coupled to superfluid\nbosonic ensemble the opposite is true. In particular, this\nrules out an adiabatic elimination of the bosonic field. In\ncontrast, we demonstrate in the present system polaronic\nquasi-particles dominate the low-temperature behaviour\nof the system. We also note that the 1-D p-wave superfluid we obtain here may be of relevance to recent studies\n\n\f2\nin quantum information in Ref.[7].\nWe first consider a mixture of spinless fermionic (f )\nand bosonic (b) atoms.

The tunneling amplitudes tf /b , and\nthe particle interactions Ub and Ubf depend on the laser\nbeam intensities and the s-wave scattering lengths, and\ncan be calculated explicitly (see e.g. Ref.[15]). In this\npaper we assume that the filling fraction of fermions\n\u03bdf \u2261 hnf,i i is not commensurate with the lattice or\nwith the filling fraction of bosons \u03bdb . The Fermi momentum and velocity are given by kf = \u03c0\u03bdf and vf =\n2tf sin(kf ),respectively.\nThe Haldane's bosonization representations for\nfermion and boson operators are constructed as [8, 13]\n1/2 P\u221e\n(2m+1)i\u0398f i\u03a6f\nf (x)\n=\n[\u03bdf + \u03a0f ]\ne\nand\nm=\u2212\u221e e\n1/2 P\u221e\n2mi\u0398b i\u03a6b\nb(x) = [\u03bdb + \u03a0b ]\ne , where x is a\nm=\u2212\u221e e\ncontinuous coordinate that replaces the site index i in\nEq.

To understand the\nnature of the many-body state of BFM outside of the\ninstability region we analyze the long distance behavior\nof the correlation functions. For the bare bosonic and\n\u22121\n1\nfermionic particles we find hb(x)b\u2020 (0)i \u223c |x|\u2212 2 K\u01eb and\n\u22121\n1\nhf (x)f \u2020 (0)i \u223c cos(kf x)|x|\u2212 2 (K\u03b2 +K\u03b3 ) (see Ref.[20]). To\ndescribe particles dressed by the other species we introduce the composite operators\nf \u0303\u03bb (x) \u2261 e\u2212i\u03bb\u03a6b (x) f (x),\n\nb\u0303\u03b7 (x) \u2261 e\u2212i\u03b7\u03a6f (x) b(x),\n\n(9)\n\nwith \u03bb and \u03b7 being real numbers. The correlation functions of these operators are given by hf \u0303(x)f \u0303\u2020 (0)i \u223c\n\n\f3\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nGround states of one dimensional systems are often\ncharacterized by specifying the order parameters that\nhave the slowest long distance decay of the correlation functions [11]. This is equivalent to finding the\nmost divergent susceptibility in the low temperature\nlimit (When the T = 0 correlation function decays as\nhO(x)O(0)i \u223c 1/|x|2\u2212\u03b1 , the finite T susceptibility diverges as \u03c7(T ) \u223c 1/T \u03b1). For the 2kf CDW order parameter, OCDW = fL\u2020 fR , we find \u03b1CDW = 2 \u2212 2K\u03b2 , and for\n \u0303\nthe f -polaron pairing\nOf \u2212P P = f \u0303L\u03bb\n\u0002 2 \u22121field, \u22121\n\u0003 fR\u03bb , we obtain\n\u22121\n\u03b1f \u2212P P = 2\u22122 \u03bb K\u01eb + K\u03b3 \u2212 2\u03bbK\u03b3\u01eb . We did not include polaron dressing in OCDW , since this operator has\nno net fermionic charge and the exponent of OCDW does\nnot change if we replace f by f \u0303. For the f -PP operator,\non the other hand, \u03b1f \u2212P P is maximized when \u03bb = \u03bbc ,\nso from now on \u03b1f \u2212P P will always mean the f -PP exponent computed with the optimal \u03bbc . Scaling exponents\nshown in Fig. 2(a) demonstrate that divergencies of the\nCDW and f -PP susceptibilities are mutually exclusive\nand cover the entire phase diagram. In Fig. 2(b) we\nshow a global phase diagram of a BFM considering the\nFP coupling (g) and effective fermion-fermion interaction\n(G) as independent variables. This phase diagram is similar to what one finds for spinless electrons in Luttinger\nliquid theory [11]. The phase diagram in terms of experimentally controlled parameters was shown in Fig. 1.\nWe point out that if we were to define the pairing operator using bare fermions rather than f -polarons with\noptimal \u03bbc , we would have a region in the phase diagram\nin which none of the susceptibilities diverges (for the parameters used in Fig. 2(a) this regime extends between\n0.55 < g/vf < 0.68).\nWe next verify that the conventional construction\nof polaron operators based on the canonical polaron\ntransformation (CPT) [21] can give an equivalent polaronic description asPin Eq.[9]. The CPT operator is\n\u2212i\u03bb\n(Fk \u03b2k \u03c1\u2020k +h.c.)\nk6=0\n, where \u03b2k is the\ngiven by U\u03bb = e\nphonon annihilation operator, \u03c1k is the fermion density operator, Fk is some function of momentum k,\nand \u03bb specifies the strength of the phonon dressing.\nWhen applied to a fermion\noperator, the CPT givesi\nh\n\u0001\nP\nU\u03bb\u22121 f (x)U\u03bb = f (x) exp \u2212i\u03bb k6=0 Fk \u03b2k e\u2212ik*x + h.c.\n[21], which is the same as Eq.(9), provided that one takes\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n.\n\n\u03b1\n\nb\u2212P\n\n2\n\nBB\n\nG / vf\n\n1\n\ncos(kf x)|x|\u2212 2 (K\u03b2 +\u03bb K\u01eb +K\u03b3 \u22122\u03bbK\u03b3\u01eb ) and hb\u0303(x)b\u0303\u2020 (0)i \u223c\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n1\n|x|\u2212 2 (K\u01eb +\u03b7 K\u03b3 \u22122\u03b7K\u03b3\u01eb ) (see Ref.[20]). We observe that\nthe exponents of the correlation functions are maximized\nwith \u03bbc = K\u01eb /K\u03b3\u01eb and \u03b7c = K\u03b3 /K\u03b3\u01eb, which we use to\nconstruct polaronic particles according to Eq. [9]. In\nthe limit of weak interactions we have \u03bbc \u2192 Ubf /Ub and\n\u03b7c \u2192 2Ubf /\u03c0vb . This result can be understood by a naive\ndensity counting argument that a fermionic polaron (f polaron) locally suppresses a bosonic cloud by \u03bbc particles, whereas a bosonic polaron (b-polaron) depletes the\nfermionic system by \u03b7c atoms.\n\n1\n\nCDW\n\nf\u2212PP\n\n0.1\n\nCDW\n\n3\n\nf\u2212PP\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\nBFP\n\n0.8\n\ng / vf\n\nPS\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\ng / vf\nFIG. 2: Ground state of a BFM with spinless fermions. g is\nthe longitudinal FP coupling and G is the effective fermionfermion interaction after integrating out 2kf phonons.

The thermal correlation lengths for OCDW and Of \u2212P P are approximately\ngiven by \u03be \u223c vf /kB T . For a finite system of length\nL = N \u03bbL (N being the number of lattice sites), the\nT = 0-properties of the system are visible for \u03be \u223c L.\nThis corresponds to a temperature regime of T \u223c Tf /N ,\nTf being the Fermi temperature.\nBefore concluding our discussion of BFM with spinless fermions we discuss an approach for observing the\nphase transition between the CDW and the f -PP phases\nin laser stirring experiments [22]. Suppose that a laser\nbeam is focused at the center of the cloud, such that it\ncreates a weak local potential for fermionic atoms. In the\nf -PP phase the stirring potential can be moved through\nthe system with no dissipation, if its velocity is slower\nthan some critical value [22]. At the f -PP/CDW phase\nboundary the critical velocity goes to zero, reflecting a\ntransition to the insulating (CDW) state. This scenario\nfollows from an RG analysis of a small local potential\nfor fermions: Such a potential is irrelevant in the f -PP\nphase, but becomes relevant in the CDW phase, similar\nto the single impurity problem of a 1D electron system\n[23]. It should be emphasized that only when polarons\nare used to construct Cooper pairs, the paired phase coincides with the domain of irrelevance of a small pinning\npotential.\nWe now extend our analysis to BFM with fermions\nwith two internal hyperfine states, which we assume\nto be SU (2) symmetric. Spin symmetry of the system leads to separation of the bosonized Hamiltonian\ninto spin and charge sectors.

In (a)\nU\u2191\u2193 /vf = \u22120.8\u03c0 and in (b) U\u2191\u2193 /vf = 0.8\u03c0. At the top of (b)\nand everywhere in (a) we have g1\u22a5 < 0 (K\u03c3 < 1), and g1\u22a5 < 0\n(K\u03c3 > 1) at the bottom of (b). For larger G and U\u2191\u2193 one can\nalso have a Wigner crystal phase (not shown here). Note that\nparentheses (. . .) indicate subdominant phases, while square\nbrackets [. . .] indicate degenerate phases.\n\nthe Hamiltonian is equivalent to a BFM with spinless\natoms and can be diagonalized analogously. The spin\npart of the Hamiltonian has\ni\nh a form of the sine-Gordon\nR\n2\nmodel, H\u03c3 = 21 v\u03c3 dx \u03c0\u03a0\u03c3 (x)2 + \u03c01 (\u2202x \u03a6\u03c3 (x)) +\n\u0002\u221a\n\u0003\n2g1\u22a5 R\ndx cos 8K\u03c3 \u0398\u03c3 (x) , where v\u03c3 is the spin ve(2\u03c0\u03b1)2\nlocity, K\u03c3 is the spin Luttinger exponent, and g1\u22a5 =\nU\u2191\u2193 \u2212 4\u03c0G is the effective backward scattering amplitude for fermions, that has contributions from the bare\nfermion-fermion interaction and from integrating out 2kf\nphonons. The nature of spin excitations in the ground\nstate follows from the well known properties of the sineGordon model: For K\u03c3 > 1 the system has gapless spin\nexcitations (g1\u22a5 is irrelevant), for K\u03c3 < 1 the system has\na spin gap (g1\u22a5 becomes relevant). In order to describe\npossible ground states of the system we calculated the\nlow temperature behavior of susceptibilities for the following order parameters: 2kf spin density wave (\u03c7SDW ),\n2kf charge density wave (\u03c7CDW ), 4kf (Wigner crystal) charge density wave (\u03c7W C ), singlet polaron pairing\n(\u03c7SP P ), and triplet polaron pairing (\u03c7T P P ). Depending on the parameters we find the following regimes: 1)\nEqually divergent \u03c7CDW and \u03c7SDW . Degenerate CDW\nand SDW phases; 2) Equally divergent \u03c7SP P and \u03c7T P P .\nDegenerate SPP and TPP phases; 3) Divergent \u03c7SP P .\nState with singlet pairing of polarons; 4) Both \u03c7CDW\nand \u03c7SP P diverge, but unequally. This probably corresponds to a phase that has both a CDW order and singlet\npolaron pairing; 5) Divergent \u03c7CDW . CDW phase; 6) Divergent \u03c7W C . Wigner crystal phase. The phase diagram\nin Fig. 3 again shows remarkable similarity to a phase\ndiagram for interacting electrons [11].\nIn summary, we used the bosonization method to investigate 1D mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms\ninvolving spinless and S = 1/2 fermions. Interactions\nbetween atoms can lead to such interesting phenomena\n\nas spin and charge density waves, singlet and triplet pairing of atoms. This phase diagram can be understood in\nterms of polarons, in that it corresponds to a Luttinger\nliquid of polarons. We also discussed laser stirring experiments as a technique for probing quantum phase transitions between paired and insulating phases of polarons,\nand considered the finite temperature and size of a real\nsystem.\nWe thank B.I.
