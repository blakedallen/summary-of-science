Motivated by the lack of a unified description for this\nsystem, we perform a theoretical study based on density functional theory as well as state-of-the-art\nnumerical many-body calculations. We propose an effective generalized spin-1/2 diamond chain\nmodel which provides a consistent description of experiments: low-temperature magnetization, inelastic neutron scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, magnetic susceptibility as well\nas new specific heat measurements. With this study we demonstrate that the balanced combination of first principles with powerful many-body methods successfully describes the behavior of this\nfrustrated material.\nPACS numbers: 75.50.Ee, 71.15.Mb, 75.30.Et, 75.10.Jm\n\nThe natural mineral azurite Cu3 (CO3 )2 (OH)2 has\nbeen used as a blue pigment since the time of the ancient\nEgyptians; the beautiful intense blue color (see Fig. 1 (a))\nis due to the crystal field splitting of Cu 3d orbitals in\nsquare planar coordination. More recently, the discovery of a plateau at 1/3 of the saturation value in the\nlow-temperature magnetization curve [1, 2] has triggered\nintensive interest in the magnetic properties of azurite.\nFrom the point of view of magnetism, the most important structural motives [3] are diamond-like chains which\nare formed by the spin-1/2 copper atoms (Fig. 1 (b)).\nIf all exchange constants were antiferromagnetic, azurite\nwould fall into the class of geometrically frustrated magnets. These systems are fascinating since the competition of the magnetic interactions suppresses classically\nordered states and may give rise to new states of matter\nwith exotic excitations (see Ref. [4] for a recent review).\nIn particular, for a certain class of frustrated magnets\nincluding diamond chains, one expects localized (dispersionless) many-body states at high magnetic fields [5];\nindeed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) on azurite exhibits an almost dispersionless branch of excitations [6].\nThere have been a number of attempts [1, 6\u201310] to derive a microscopic model for the complex magnetic properties of azurite. The results are, however, contradictory\nand up to now none of these models was able to yield\na fully consistent picture of the experimentally observed\nbehavior. Some authors favor a diamond chain model\nwith all exchanges antiferromagnetic [1, 9, 11] while other\n\nauthors proposed one of the dominant exchange constants to be ferromagnetic [6\u20138]. Even more, Ref. [10]\nhas argued that interchain coupling is important in azurite. The latter may be in agreement with the observation\nof a magnetic ordering transition at about 2 K [1, 12\u201314],\nbut raises the question why no dispersion perpendicular\nto the chain direction is observed by INS [6].\nIn the present work, we combine first principles density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations with model computations based on different variants of the density-matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) method [15\u201317] (see also\nSection S2) and resolve the underlying model for azurite.\nWe find that an effective generalized spin-1/2 diamond\nchain model with a dominant next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Cu dimer coupling J2 , two antiferromagnetic nearest- and third-nearest-neighbor Cu dimermonomer exchanges J1 and J3 , and a significant direct\nCu monomer-monomer exchange Jm (see Figs. 1 (b) and\n3 (a)) explains a broad range of experiments on azurite [1, 2, 6, 18] and resolves the existing controversies.\nSince the experimentally determined positions of the\nlighter atoms in a structure usually carry larger error bars\nthan those of more heavy elements, we first performed a\nCar-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculation [19, 20] in\norder to optimize the positions of the C, O, and H atoms\nin azurite. With the optimized structure with a total of\n30 atoms in the unit cell we determined the electronic\nproperties of azurite [21]. The band structure shows six\nnarrow Cu 3dx2 \u2212y2 bands at the Fermi level \u2013 correspond-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1. (a) Example of an azurite crystal aggregate.

Fig. 2 (c) shows a charge density\nisosurface where a dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry of the Cu d orbitals\nis evident without contribution of dz2 character, contrary\nto previous suggestions [22, 23].\nWhile the GGA calculation describes this system as\nmetallic, the insulating behavior is correctly given within\nthe GGA+U approach (see below).

Under the assumption that the exchange couplings are antiferromagnetic, we can estimate the magnitude of the exchange couplings via second-order perturbation theory: JiAFM = 4t2i /U where U is the Cu 3d\nonsite Coulomb interaction strength. From this analysis\nwe identify six further relevant couplings in addition to\nJ1 , J2 and J3 : the monomer-monomer exchange Jm also\nconsidered by Rule et al.

Exchange constants in Kelvin (K) derived from\nFPLO GGA+U calculations with U = 8 eV and JH = 1 eV\nfor the various model steps considered in the present work\n(see text for explanation). The error margin for each Ji in\nthe third line is estimated to be of the order 1 to 2 K.\n\nCu dimer interaction Jd along the chain. In addition,\nJ4 and J7 provide couplings between Cu dimer atoms in\nneighboring chains, whereas J5 and J6 correspond to Cu\nmonomer-dimer interchain-interactions. The interaction\npaths between chains are visualized in Fig. 1 (c) and (d).\nNext, we obtain the correct sign (ferro- or antiferromagnetic) and magnitude of the Ji from total energy\ncalculations for different Cu spin configurations in supercells with up to 60 atoms. We employ the full potential local orbital (FPLO) method [26] with the GGA+U\nfunctional for U = 4, 6, and 8 eV. We map the energy\ndifferences of the frozen collinear spin configurations onto\na spin-1/2 Heisenberg model and evaluate the exchange\nconstants J in a dimer approximation [27]. The nine relevant Cu-Cu interaction paths obtained from the downfolding calculations have been probed with 10 different\nantiferromagnetic spin configurations together with the\nferromagnetic configuration. The result for a choice of\nU = 8 eV and JH = 1 eV is shown in the first line\nof Table I. As expected from experimental observations,\nJ2 dominates and exhibits a 1/U dependence (see Section S1). The two couplings J1 and J3 are very similar\nin magnitude, suggesting an almost symmetric diamond\nchain. We observe that except for J1 , J2 , and J3 , the coupling strengths are of the order of a few Kelvin. Comparing our set of parameters in Table I, line 1 to that\nobtained in Ref. [10], the main differences are that we\ndetermined the additional 3D couplings J4 , J5 , and J7 ,\nand our value for Jm , double-checked with two full potential methods [21, 26], is clearly nonzero.\nAt first sight, the fact that interchain coupling turns\nout to be appreciable is surprising because INS did not\nobserve any dispersion perpendicular to the chain direction [6]. However, since the dimer exchange J2 dominates, one can use perturbative arguments along the\nlines of Ref. [28] to show that there are no low-energy\nexcitations dispersing perpendicular to the chains. The\nessential ingredients of the argument are that (i) the interchain exchange constants J4 to J7 are small compared\nto J2 and (ii) they connect only to dimers of the neighboring chains (compare Figs. 1 (c) and (d)), i.e., they\ncontribute only in second or third order in perturbation\ntheory (see Section S4); this would suggest using an ef-\n\nfective one-dimensional model with the values of J1 , J2 ,\nJ3 , and Jm adjusted to incorporate the effect of the threedimensional couplings. Table I line 2 shows the results\nobtained by solving the 10 spin configurations only for\nthe diamond chain couplings. This corresponds to an\naveraging over the 3D couplings and translates into a\nsignificant asymmetry of the diamond chain J1 > J3 .\nThe effective one-dimensional model has the additional\nadvantage that it is amenable to detailed quantum mechanical model calculations, thus allowing a quantitative\ncomparison with experimental data for azurite.\nFrom these results salient experimental features of azurite can already be understood at a qualitative level: two\nthirds of the Cu2+ spins are strongly bound by J2 into\ndimer singlets while another third consists of monomer\nspins which interact weakly by Jm and additional effective monomer-monomer interactions which are generated by integrating out the dimers. In an applied magnetic field, the monomer spins are therefore polarized\nfirst while the dimer spins remain in the singlet state,\ngiving rise to the 1/3 plateau [1, 2, 18]. Furthermore,\nthe two energy scales, i.e., the low-energy scale given by\nthe monomer-monomer interactions and the high-energy\nscale associated to the dimers give rise to the double-peak\nstructures observed in the magnetic susceptibility [1] and\nthe specific heat [1, 6]. Finally, we expect a band of lowenergy monomer excitations dispersing along the chain\ndirection and a band of dimer excitations at higher energies whose dispersion is additionally suppressed by the\ncompetition of J1 and J3 , as indeed observed by INS [6].\nWe will now show that we can also describe these experimental results quantitatively. The DFT results leave\nsome freedom concerning the overall energy scale, however the ratios of the Ji are expected to be subject only\nto small errors [29]. We therefore first slightly refined\nthe parameter ratios using the magnetization and INS\nexperiments, leading to J1 /J2 = 0.47, J3 /J2 = 0.21, and\nJm /J2 = 0.14. The global energy scale is finally adjusted\nto the magnetization curve (see below) and we obtain the\nexchange coupling constants Ji in Table I, line 3.\nIn order to fully account for the quantum nature of the\nspins residing on the Cu2+ ions, we use a spin 1/2 HeisenP\n~i * S\n~j \u2212 g \u03bcB H P S z , where\nberg model H = hi,ji Ji,j S\ni i\n~i are spin 1/2 operators, Ji,j is the exchange constant\nS\nconnecting sites i and j (see Fig. 3 (a)), H an external\nmagnetic field and \u03bcB the Bohr magneton. The gyromagnetic ratio g is set to 2.06 [30].\nFig. 3 (b) shows a comparison for the experimental\nand computed magnetization curves. The overall energy\nscale is J2 = 33 K, leading to our final parameter set in\nTable I, line 3. The agreement of the theoretical magnetization curve in Fig. 3 (b) with the experimental result for H \u22a5 b [2] is excellent. Note that the experimental curve for H \u22a5 b exhibits a nice plateau as expected for a Heisenberg model whereas for H k b the\n\n\f4\nplateau is washed out [1], indicative of non-commuting\nfields. Therefore we compare our results for the isotropic\nHeisenberg model with experiments for H \u22a5 b. We find\nthat dimer spins should be about 2.7% polarized each\n(see Section S6), i.e., dimers are essentially in the singlet state whereas the single \"monomer\" spins are almost\nfully polarized in the 1/3 plateau. This is qualitatively\nconsistent with recent 63,65 Cu NMR [18].\nAt this stage, the values of all Ji are fixed and we have\na parameter-free prediction of the magnetic susceptibility\n\u03c7. Fig. 3 (c) compares our computations [16] with our\nmeasurement of the magnetic susceptibility of azurite for\nH \u22a5 b, which is very similar to the original experiment\nof Ref. [1]. Our parameter set (Table I, line 3) leads to\na small, but qualitative improvement compared to the\noriginal one of [1] (see Table I, line 4): we reproduce\na double-peak-like structure at the correct temperatures\nwhereas only a single peak [7] is obtained with the parameters of [1].\nAnalogous to the magnetic susceptibility, we also have\na parameter-free prediction for the magnetic specific\nheat. At zero field, two anomalies have been observed\nin the specific heat at T = 18 K [1] and T = 4 K [1, 6].\nFig. 3 (d) compares the field-dependence of the experimental specific heat with results calculated [16] for the\nparameters of Table I, line 3. The sharp peak in the\nexperimental curves slightly below 2 K [1, 12] signals\nan ordering transition which is out of reach of a onedimensional model. Nevertheless, not only are the numerical values of the specific heat for 2 K < T <\n\u223c 10 K\ncomparable between theory and experiment, but also\nimportant features are reproduced correctly: (i) a lowtemperature peak appears for H = 0 at T \u2248 3 to 4 K.\nNote that this low-temperature peak at H = 0 is absent [8] for the original parameter set of Ref. [1] (compare\nthe dashed curve in the lower panel of Fig. 3 (d)). (ii)\nThe low-temperature peak is gradually suppressed by an\napplied field, as emphasized by down arrows in the figure.\n(iii) In the temperature range 7 K \u2264 T \u2264 10 K, the specific heat increases not only with temperature but also\nwith increasing magnetic field (marked by up arrows).\nFig. 3 (e) shows our numerical result [17] (see also Section S2) for the transverse dynamic structure factor on\nthe 1/3 plateau as a function of momentum transfer k\nalong the chain direction and energy E. The peak values of the dynamic structure factor trace two dispersion\ncurves nicely. Comparison with the corresponding INS\nresults [6] (white symbols in Fig. 3 (e)) shows that the\ncomputed ratio of the bandwidths is extremely close to\nthe experimental value of about 1/6 [31]. Also the total intensities in the peaks compare favorably with the\nexperimental results [6].\nTo summarize, we have shown that the combination\nof first principles DFT with state-of-the-art many-body\ncalculations successfully provides a microscopic model\nfor the frustrated magnet azurite, which explains a wide\n\nrange of experiments [1, 2, 6, 18]. We believe that attempts to fit such a range of experiments, using at least\nfour exchange constants Ji , are bound to fail. Hence, the\nguiding DFT computations were essential. There are several issues for further experimental and theoretical study\n(see Section S8). In particular, the implications of the\nfull three-dimensional model which we have derived remain to be explored.\nWe would like to thank H. Kikuchi and S. S\u00fcllow\nfor providing us with the experimental data shown in\nFig. 3 (b) and (e), respectively. Useful discussions with\nC. Berthier, M. Horvati\u0107, and S.

We employed a plane wave cutoff of 30 Ryd\nfor the plane wave part and of 120 Ryd for the density,\nrespectively, and we used the following sets of (s,p,d)\nprojector functions per angular momentum: Cu(2,2,2),\nO(2,2,1), C(2,2,1) and H(2,0,0). We employed a (4\u00d74\u00d74)\nk mesh and the P 21/c symmetry was preserved during the relaxation with the help of 60 constraints. The\nrelaxation with the generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA) functional [32] resulted in small bond length\nchanges of up to 4% and in angle changes up to 2\u25e6 compared to the experimental data from Ref. [3].\nThe relative strengths of the exchange pathways in\nazurite have been obtained by using the electronic\nstructure technique of muffin-tin orbital (MTO) based\nNMTO-downfolding [24, 33].\nDFT calculations were performed with the full potential local orbital method [26] (FPLO), version 8.50,\nand the full potential augmented plane wave (FLAPW)\nmethod as implemented in the WIEN2k [21] code, which\nhas been used to crosscheck the FPLO results for selected\nsupercells. Total energies for different spin configurations were obtained in the GGA+U formalism, employing\nboth the atomic limit (AL) as well as the around mean\nfield (AMF) double counting correction. The AL double\ncounting correction turned out to be the better choice for\nthe calculation of a realistic set of model parameters for\nazurite because the ratios Ji /J2 are strongly dependent\non U in the case of the AMF double counting correction\nand can even adopt unphysical values (J1 , J3 > J2 ).\nTable SI shows the complete set of exchange coupling\n\n\f5\nJ2\nJ3\nU [eV] J1\n4\n34.1 145.4 35.4\n21.3 82.8 21.2\n6\n8\n13.5 42.8 12.5\n\nJ4\n5.9\n3.8\n2.7\n\nJ5\n2.9\n1.5\n0.6\n\nJ6\n16.2\n8.6\n4.4\n\nJ7\n\u20131.7\n\u20131.8\n\u20131.7\n\nJm\n5.9\n3.9\n2.6\n\nJd\n\u20131.7\n\u20130.8\n\u20130.4\n\nTABLE SI.

Effective exchange constants in K for a minimal\nmodel including only J1 , J2 , J3 , and Jm obtained via statistical averaging (see text).\n\nS2.\n\nparameters Ji , obtained with the FPLO code (version\n8.50) employing the GGA+U functional with atomic\nlimit double counting correction. The calculations were\nrepeated for three choices of the Coulomb correlation\nstrength, U = 4 eV, 6 eV and 8 eV. The Hund's rule\ncoupling JH was chosen as JH = 1 eV. The dominant\ncoupling exhibits a proportionality to 1/U . Note that\nthe relative importance of the monomer-monomer coupling increases as U is increased.\nJ2 is antiferromagnetic and the dominant interaction.\nOne can therefore apply perturbative considerations in\nJi /J2 and argue that interchain excitations can be neglected to a first approximation (see Section S4). The essential items are that the interchain exchange constants\nJ4 to J7 are small compared to J2 and that they connect only to dimers of the neighboring chains (compare\nFigs. 1 (c) and (d)).\nThis suggests to reduce the set of interaction parameters to a minimal model including J1 , J2 , J3 , and Jm\nonly. In order to determine the effective values of these\nexchange constants quantitatively, we performed a leastsquare fit for the energy differences including only J1 ,\nJ2 , J3 , and Jm in the model and set all other parameters\nto zero. It should be noted that the exchange constants\nobtained in this way are effective parameters, which contain the effect of the remaining parameters not included\nin the model as statistical average. Furthermore, it is also\nimportant that the procedure of statistical averaging is\ndone over a sufficiently large manifold, since otherwise\nthe effective parameters are to some degree arbitrary.\nThe results are shown in Table SII. It can be seen that\nin the minimal model the effective parameters J1 and J3\nshow a strong asymmetry, which is not present in the full\nset of interaction parameters shown in Table SI. This is\nmainly due to integrating out of the fairly large coupling\nparameter J6 in the model, which couples Cu monomer\nwith Cu dimer atoms and in this way provides an effective asymmetry of J1 and J3 (inclusion of J6 in addition\nto the minimal model again results in nearly identical J1\nand J3 values).\n\nJm\n3.4\n3.0\n2.4\n\nDMRG calculations\n\nThe theoretical magnetization curve in Fig. 3 (b) has\nbeen obtained with the static density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method [15, 34] using m = 300\nstates per block and four sweeps in each magnetization sector. The theory curves in Figs. 3 (c), 3 (d),\nand S1 have been obtained using transfer-matrix DMRG\n(TMRG [16, 35]) for the infinite system and m = 300.\nNote that these are in agreement with previous TMRG\ncomputations [7, 8] for the parameters of Ref. [1].\nThe transverse dynamic structure factor of Fig. 3 (e)\nhas been computed by dynamic DMRG [17] for the parameters of Table I, line 3, using open chains with N = 60\nsites, up to m = 200 states per block and two sweeps per\nenergy point. Note that for a meaningful comparison of\nscattering intensities with experiment, we had to take the\nprecise positions of the copper atoms in azurite into account and use the same momentum perpendicular to the\nchain direction as in the experiment [6].\n\nS3.\n\nExperiment\n\nThe specific heat of a plate-like azurite single crystal\nwith the total mass of 0.36 mg was measured, employing an ac-calorimetry according to Ref. [36]. The data\nwere taken in the temperature range 1.6 K \u2264 T \u2264 30 K\nand in magnetic fields up to 8 T. The experiments were\nperformed using a home-built AC-calorimeter especially\ndesigned for small plate-like samples. The sample holder,\nconsisting of a resistive thermometer (Cernox CX-1080BG) and a heater, is attached to a 4 He-bath cryostat\nequipped with a superconducting magnet.\nThe magnetic susceptibility of azurite was measured\nin the temperature range between 2 K \u2264 T \u2264 300 K\nand in magnetic fields up to H = 4 T using a Quantum\nDesign SQUID magnetometer. The orientation of the\nsingle crystal (mass 55.26 mg) with respect to the external field was H \u22a5 b-axis. The data were corrected for the\ntemperature-independent diamagnetic core contribution,\naccording to Ref. [37] and the magnetic contribution of\nthe sample holder. The latter was determined from an\nindependent measurement.\n\n\f6\n1\n\nPerturbative treatment of interchain coupling\n\nFor a large and antiferromagnetic J2 , one can use perturbative arguments to integrate out the copper dimers\nand generate effective interactions between the monomer\ncopper atoms. In the limit of infinite J2 , the two spins on\nthe corresponding dimer bond are in their singlet state\n\u221a1 (| \u2191\u2193i \u2212 | \u2193\u2191i). In this limit, the only interaction be2\ntween the monomer spins is Jm . However, one can use\ndegenerate perturbation theory in Ji /J2 to generate further interactions between the monomer spins.\nThe second-order contribution to the monomermonomer interactions within a chain is known [28] to\nbe given by\n(J1 \u2212 J3 )2\n.\nJ \u0303m =\n2 J2\n\n(1)\n\nThis effective interaction enhances the bare interaction\nJm between the monomers along the chain provided that\nJ1 6= J3 .\nThe interactions J4 and J7 connect dimers of neighboring chains (see Fig. 1 (d)). Accordingly, they contribute\nto interchain monomer-monomer exchange only in third\norder in perturbation theory and generate exchanges\n\u221d J12 J4 /J22 , J1 J3 J4 /J22 , J12 J7 /J22 and J1 J3 J7 /J22 . Using the values of the Ji in Table I, line 1, these effective\ninterchain exchanges are estimated to be at most on the\norder of 0.3 K \u2248 Jm /10 and thus can be neglected safely.\nBy contrast, J5 and J6 contribute in second order perturbation theory to interchain coupling since they connect dimers with monomers of the neighboring chains\n(see Fig. 1 (c)). The contribution from J5 is given by\n(J1 + J3 ) J5 /(2 J2 ). Inserting the numbers from Table I, line 1, this again turns out to be on the order\nof 0.2 K \u2248 Jm /10, i.e., also J5 is sufficiently small to be\nneglected safely.\nThe exchange constant J6 also contributes terms proportional to J1 J6 /J2 and J3 J6 /J2 to interchain effective monomer-monomer coupling. Inserting again the\nvalues of J1 , J2 , J3 , and J6 in Table I, line 1 into the\nsecond-order expression, we now obtain a contribution\non the order of 1.4 K \u2248 Jm /2 to the effective interchain\nmonomer-monomer coupling. On the one hand, this is\nstill sufficiently small not to give rise to relevant dispersion of the excitations perpendicular to the chains,\nin agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on azurite [6]. On the other hand, this value is too large to\nneglect J6 completely.\nIn fact, in a mean-field picture, the monomer moments\ninfluence the effective monomer-monomer exchange along\nthe neighboring chains. The reason is that the interchain\ncouplings connect the monomer spins only to one of the\ndimer spins on the neighboring chains, thus breaking the\nsymmetry of the exchange process along the chains and\ngiving rise to corrections to (1).

The\ndifference between lines 1 and 2 of Table I or Tables SI\nand SII can indeed be understood at least qualitatively\nin this way although the reduction has been performed\nin a completely different manner.\n\nS5.\n\nSpecific heat\n\nExperimentally, two anomalies have been observed in\nthe magnetic specific heat at T \u2248 18 K [1] and T \u2248\n4 K [1, 6] (compare also top panel of Fig. 3 (d)). Fig. S1\nshows TMRG results for the specific heat per spin C in\nzero magnetic field. For our new parameter set, Table I,\nline 3 (black line in Fig. S1), we find a maximum of C at\na temperature slightly above 10 K and a low-temperature\nfeature at T \u2248 3 K. Although this does not reproduce the\nexperimental temperatures exactly, it is in better agreement with the experimental findings than the results for\nthe original parameter set of Ref. [1] (red line in Fig. S1).\nFig. S1 includes exact diagonalization (ED) results for\nrings with N = 18 spins.

Dashed lines indicate the location of\nthe experimental result [6] for the corresponding excitations.\n\nStructure of the 1/3 plateau\n\nThe 1/3 plateau state of azurite has been characterized\nusing NMR [18], which amounts to a measurement of the\nexpectation values hSiz i. This NMR study showed that\nthe dimer spins are essentially in their singlet state with\njust 10% spin polarization on the dimers. Correspondingly, the monomer spins are almost polarized on the 1/3\nplateau.\nUsing ED for rings with N = 18, 24, 30, and 36 sites\nand our parameters line 3 of Table I, we find the structure\nof the M = 1/3 plateau state presented in Table SIII. We\nobserve that the numerical results for the expectation values converge rapidly with system size and read off that\nthe dimer spins are about 2.7% polarized each. This is\nonly slightly smaller than the 10% observed in Ref. [18].\nWe note that the NMR experiment [18] involved a rotation around the crystallographic a-axis and speculate\nthat this gives rise to non-commuting fields which enhance the dimer polarization as compared to the ideal\nHeisenberg model.\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n\u03c0/4\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n3 \u03c0/4\n\n\u03c0\n\nk\n\nFIG.

These experiments observed two\ncosine-like bands of magnetic excitations with a minimum energy at the antiferromagnetic wave vector k = \u03c0.\nThe two bands are sketched by the dashed lines in\nFigs. S2\u2013S6. They are centered around \u2248 1.3 meV and\n\u2248 2.35 meV and have a width of 20.2 K and 3.6 K, respectively. In particular the ratio of the bandwidths of\nthe upper and lower bands is 1.8/10.1 \u2248 1/5.6.\nFigs. S2\u2013S6 show the excitation spectrum as a function of momentum k along the chain direction on the\n1/3 plateau computed by exact diagonalization with periodic boundary conditions. Black, blue, and red symbols\ncorrespond to excitations with \u2206S z = \u22121, 0, and 1, respectively. The blue symbol at k = 0 and energy E = 0\ncorresponds to the ground state of the 1/3 plateau. A\nFourier analysis of the lowest \u2206S z = \u00b11 excitations for\nN = 30 sites yields the solid lines in Figs. S2\u2013S6. One\nobserves that the lowest \u2206S z = \u00b11 excitations collapse\nonto these lines for all sizes N , demonstrating that the\nmain effect of a finite system size N on these excitations\nis a discretization of the allowed values of the momentum\nk (see also [9]).\nFirst let us look at our final parameter set Table I, line\n3. The lowest black and red excitation in Fig. S2, i.e., the\ntwo solid curves correspond to the two dispersion curves\nalready observed in Fig. 3 (e). Note that energy and momentum resolution in Fig. 3 (e) is essentially limited by\nthe open ends of the finite-size chains which were used for\nthe dynamic DMRG computations. Evidently, inspection of the momentum-resolved bare energy levels shown\nin Fig. S2 yields better energy-momentum resolution at\nthe expense of losing information about the neutron intensities of the excitations. Indeed, in Fig. S2 we see a\nlarge number of excitations at energies above 2 meV and\n\nonly the dynamic structure factor of Fig. 3 (e) shows that\nthey have very little contribution to the inelastic neutron\ncross section. From the bare energy levels of Fig. S2, we\nread off a bandwidth ratio of 1/5.3 which is very close to\nthe experimental value [6].\nFig. S3 shows the expected excitation spectrum for\nKikuchi's original parameter set Table I, line 4 [1]. Note\nthat we have computed only the 20 lowest excitations in\nsome sectors for N \u2265 24 and that the density of states is\nalready quite large at energies above 1 meV in the present\ncase. Hence, some levels may be missing in Fig. S3 at\nenergies E > 2 meV for S z \u2264 N/6 and N \u2265 24. We nevertheless keep this region in order to be able to show the\nlocation of the excitations observed by inelastic neutron\nscattering on azurite [6] (dashed lines). In the present\ncase it is not so easy to distinguish two cosine-like bands\nin the numerical results. If one uses the lowest black and\nred energy level, respectively, one finds a bandwidth ratio\nclose to 1/1.9, quite far off the experimental result [6].\nFurther proposals of parameters sets [6\u20138] contain a\nferromagnetic J3 . Ref. [10] already pointed out that a\nferromagnetic J3 is hard to reconcile with the crystal\nstructure of azurite given the dx2 \u2212y2 character of the relevant copper orbitals. We will nevertheless look at the\nexcitation spectra for these parameter sets and demonstrate that they are either inconsistent or at least yield\nless good agreement with the neutron scattering experiments [6] than our final parameter set given in Table I,\nline 3.\nThe parameter set of Gu and Su [7, 8] J1 = 23 K, J2 =\n43.7 K, J3xy = \u22126.9 K, J3z = \u221211.73 K, Jm = 0 has an\nartificially large magnetic anisotropy in the supposedly\nferromagnetic J3 . Replacing this by an average value\nJ3 = \u22129.3 K, we find the excitation spectrum shown in\nFig. S4. Not only is the bandwidth ratio of approximately\n1/1.8 again far away from the experimental result [6], but\nin this case the upper excitation branch is about 1 meV\n(\u2248 10 K) too high in energy.\nFinally, Ref. [6] tried to invert perturbative results\nfor the effective monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer exchanges along the chain in order to propose J1 = 1 K,\nJ2 = 55 K and a ferromagnetic J3 = \u221220 K. We discuss\ntwo variants of these parameters, starting in Fig. S5 with\nJm = 0. In this case, we find a bandwidth ratio 1/1.4\nwhich is clearly inconsistent with the experimental result.\nHowever, it was already proposed in Ref. [6] to improve\nthis behavior by adding a Jm = 6.5 K. The result with\nsuch a Jm included is shown in Fig. S6. While inclusion of\nJm = 6.5 K improves the agreement with experiment [6],\nthe result is not quite as good for our final parameter set\nTable I, line 3. In particular, the bandwidth ratio is just\n1/4.\nTo summarize the discussion of this subsection, we\nhave demonstrated that our final parameter set Table I,\nline 3 yields the best agreement with inelastic neutron\nscattering on the 1/3 plateau [6] among the proposals\n\n\f9\nof Refs. [1, 6\u20138]. In particular, inelastic neutron scattering is inconsistent with the parameters proposed in\nRefs. [1, 7, 8].\n\nS8.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThere are some further refinements of the model\nfor azurite to be implemented in future investigations.\nFirstly, we have argued interchain coupling to be unimportant for a basic description of azurite, but, although\nsmall, it is present and likely to be responsible for the\nfollowing features: (i) The strong curvature at the lower\nedge of 1/3 plateau in the theoretical magnetization curve\nof Fig. 3 (b) versus the smoother behavior observed in\nthe experiment for H \u22a5 b is characteristic for one- versus higher-dimensional physics [38\u201340]. (ii) An ordering\ntransition at temperatures slightly below 2 K [1, 12\u201314] is\nevident in Fig. 3 (d), i.e., interchain coupling affects thermodynamic properties at temperatures of a few Kelvin.\nIn view of the success of the effective one-dimensional\nmodel Table I, line 3, we are confident that our prediction of Table I, line 1 for the exchange ratios of the full\nthree-dimensional model is also reliable. Indeed, it would\nbe very interesting to compare the predictions of this\nthree-dimensional model for the zero-field ordered state\nwith the corresponding recent experimental observations\n[14]. However, this will require very different methods\nfrom the present work and thus is an interesting topic\nfor future investigations.\nSecondly, we have neglected magnetic anisotropy in the\ntheoretical model although experiments [1] show that it\nis present in azurite and affects magnetic properties for\na magnetic field parallel to the crystallographic b-axis at\nan energy scale of a few Kelvin.\nFinally, we would like to emphasize that we find all\nJi antiferromagnetic with similar values of J1 and J3 ,\nthus placing azurite in a highly frustrated parameter\nregime. This is reflected by the almost localized nature\nof the dimer excitations. These excitations will become\nlow-energy excitations in magnetic fields around 32 T,\nand one expects related unusual thermodynamic behavior like an enhanced magnetocaloric effect [5, 41]. This\ncalls for additional thermodynamic measurements close\nto the saturation field of azurite.\n\n[1] H. Kikuchi, Y. Fujii, M. Chiba, S. Mitsudo, T. Idehara,\nT. Tonegawa, K. Okamoto, T. Sakai, T.
