The most dominant\ndust species in the circumstellar material are oxygen-rich\nsilicates, that are either olivines (Mg2x Fe2(1\u2212x) SiO4 ), ranging from fayalite (x = 0) to forsterite (x = 1), or pyroxenes\n(Mgx Fe(1\u2212x) SiO3 ), ranging from ferrosillite (x = 0) to enstatite (x = 1) (e.g., Kessler-Silacci et al. 2005). The spectra\nof silicate dust have vibrational spectral features near 10\u03bcm\n(covering \u223c8-14\u03bcm wavelengths), due to the Si-O stretching\nmode, and near 20\u03bcm (covering \u223c15-35\u03bcm wavelengths),\n\ndue to the O-Si-O bending mode. Several previous studies\non silicate dust composition in circumstellar disks have been\nbased on the 10\u03bcm Si-O feature, which probes the warm inner regions at a range of a few 100K to \u223c1000 K and radii\nof within a few AU in a typical T Tauri disk. In comparison,\nthe 20\u03bcm spectral feature probes cold dust in the outer zone\nof the disk, where temperatures are expected to be less than\na few hundred kelvin. Both features probe the optically thin\nsurface layers of the disk. This difference in the location of\nthe silicate emission zone can be utilized to study any radial\ndependence of the dust chemical composition, as well as processes such as turbulent diffusion and large-scale circulation\nthat would result in the mixing of disk material from the\n\n\f2\n\nRiaz et al.\n\nwarm inner to the cold outer regions, thereby reducing any\nradial concentration gradients.\nSilicate dust in the interstellar medium is observed to\nbe almost entirely amorphous in composition, with negligible crystalline fractions (<1-2%; Kemper et al. 2004; Li\net al. 2007). Amorphous dust can be thermally annealed\ninto crystalline dust at temperatures above \u223c800 K (e.g.,\nFabian et al. 2000). However, crystalline silicates have been\nfound in high abundances in comets and meteorites, which\nare formed in regions much colder than 800 K. This suggests that some radial mixing took place between the inner\nand outer parts of the Solar nebula during the early formation phase of our Solar System (e.g., Nuth et al. 2000;\nWooden 2008). The presence of crystalline grains in cold regions could also be due to in situ heating events, such as\nthe disk shocks proposed by Harker & Desch (2002). Recent\ncompositional studies based on both the 10 and 20\u03bcm silicate features for large samples of solar mass T Tauri stars\nhave indicated nearly equal, and in a few cases, even higher\ncrystalline grain abundances in the cold component of the\ndisk compared to the inner warm regions (e.g., Sargent et al.\n2009; Kessler-Silacci et al. 2006; Watson et al. 2009). This\nhas been explained by thermal annealing in the warm part\nfollowed by efficient radial transport to the cold outer disk.\nThe analysis of Stardust samples from comet Wild 2 also\nsupport the view of processing of silicates near the Sun and\nthen extensive mixing with much lower temperature materials such as cometary ices (e.g., Brownlee et al. 2006;\nZolensky et al. 2006). Large-scale radial mixing, however,\ncannot explain radial gradients in dust chemical composition as observed for a few cases among solar-type stars and\nHerbig Ae/Be stars (e.g., van Boekel et al. 2004; Bouwman\net al. 2008). A radial dependence in the relative abundances\nof the crystalline dust species instead suggests a localized\ncrystalline formation mechanism. A local temporal heating\nprocess such as shock heating or grain-grain collision could\nraise the temperature sufficiently to cause crystallization,\nfollowed by slow cooling in an optically thick and turbulent\ndisk environment (e.g., Molster et al. 1999). However, Harker\n& Desch (2002) have addressed the cooling issue for heated\ngrains in shocks in (ordinarily) cool disk regions. They conclude that making the region optically thick does not slow\ndown the cooling enough. Desch & Connolly (2002) conclude that it is the hot gas that keeps the grains warm, while\nthe gas cools slowly, at rates comparable to the slow rates\nof cooling inferred for chondrules. Alternately, crystallization process could occur in low-temperature environments\ninduced by exothermic chemical reactions (e.g., Tanaka et\nal. 2010). Such external processes could effect the timescales\nover which dust processing proceeds in the different regions\nof the disk.\nIn the sub-stellar mass domain, Riaz (2009; hereafter\nR09) presented compositional fits to the 10\u03bcm silicate emission features for 23 brown dwarf disks in the Taurus-Auriga\n(\u223c1 Myr; Kenyon & Hartmann 1995) and Upper Scorpius\n(\u223c5 Myr, Preibisch & Zinnecker 1999) star-forming regions.\nCollectively, this sample provided an opportunity to probe\nany age dependence of the different dust processing mechanisms. We had found the detection rate for emission in the\n10 \u03bcm silicate feature to decline with age, with only 20% of\nthe brown dwarfs at \u223c5 Myr showing any detectable emission in the feature. The median crystalline mass fraction for\n\nthe Taurus brown dwarfs was found to be a factor of \u223c2\nhigher than the median reported for the higher mass stars\nin Taurus, indicating crystallinity to be more prominent in\nthe warm inner regions of circum(sub)stellar disks. For most\nobjects, we had obtained nearly equal mass fractions for the\nlarge-grain and crystalline grains, and only 5% of the Taurus brown dwarfs were found to be dominated by pristine\nISM-like dust. This indicated that both the grain growth\nand crystallization processes are active in these disks, and\nsignificant dust processing has already occurred for most\nsystems by a young age of \u223c1 Myr. The R09 work was focused on the 10\u03bcm feature only, and we could not study any\nradial dependence of the dust chemical composition. Among\nbrown dwarf disks, there have been mainly two studies that\nhave focused on the 20\u03bcm silicate emission feature. Mer\u0131\u0301n\net al. (2007) and Bouy et al. (2008) presented compositional\nstudies of two young brown dwarf disks in the Lupus and\nTaurus star-forming regions, respectively, and found weak\nevidence of a decline in grain growth or the crystallinity\nlevels when comparing the mass fractions in the inner and\nthe outer parts of the disk. In the present study, we have\nanalyzed 20\u03bcm silicate spectra for 13 brown dwarf disks in\nTaurus, which is the largest sample studied so far to probe\nthe cold dust composition. This provides us with an opportunity to study the radial distribution of dust species for a\nlarge sample of brown dwarf disks, and to investigate if the\ncrystalline formation and radial transport mechanisms are\nas efficient in the sub-stellar domain as observed among the\nT Tauri systems.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nSpitzer IRS Observations\n\nWe searched the Spitzer IRS archives for 20\u03bcm silicate spectra for the 20 Taurus brown dwarf disks studied in R09.\nThese sources are spectroscopically confirmed members of\nTaurus with spectral types (SpT) of > M6, making these\nmore likely to be substellar objects (e.g., Luhman 2004), and\nare known to show excess emission in the Spitzer/IRAC and\nMIPS bands, thus confirming the presence of disks around\nthem (Luhman et al. 2010). We were able to find 20\u03bcm spectra for 18 out of the 20 sources. The Spitzer PIDs for these\nobservations are 30540, 2, 248, and 20435. Five of these show\n'flat' features at both 10 and 20\u03bcm, i.e., there is no detectable emission in the silicate features and only the underlying continuum is detected. We have not considered these\nflat spectra in our study. Our work is thus based on 20\u03bcm\nspectra for a sample of 13 brown dwarf disks. The spectra\nwere obtained in the IRS low spectral resolution modules,\nShort-Low [SL] and Long-Low [LL] (\u03bb/\u03b4 \u03bb \u223c 90). The SL\nmodule covers 5.2-14.5 \u03bcm in 2 orders, and the LL module covers 14-38 \u03bcm, also in 2 orders. The observations were\nobtained at two nod positions along each slit. The Basic Calibrated Data (BCD) were produced at the Spitzer Science\nCenter (SSC) by the S15.3 pipeline for the SL module and\nthe S17.2 pipeline for the LL module. The sky background\nwas removed from each spectrum by subtracting observations taken in the same module, but with the target in the\nother order. The spectra were extracted and calibrated using the Spitzer IRS Custom Extraction (SPICE) software\n\n\fThe radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks\nprovided by the SSC. The extraction was performed using a variable-width column extraction that scales with the\nwidth of the wavelength-dependent point spread function.\nWe used the SPICE \"optimal\" extraction algorithm that\nyields a minimal-noise, unbiased flux estimate in each wavelength bin by weighting the extraction by the object profile\nand the signal-to-noise of each pixel. The optimal extraction provides greater improvement over regular extraction\nfor low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) data. Gains in S/N up\nto a factor of 2 have been achieved for sources with S/N \u223c\n3, corresponding to an effective quadrupling of the exposure\ntime. The rectified flux and uncertainty products written\nout by the optimal extraction algorithm include corrections\nfor any offsets between different modules. Further details on\nthe optimal extraction method are provided in the SPICE\ndocumentation. We have not applied any extinction correction since Taurus suffers from little reddening (AV <1 mag;\ne.g., Luhman et al. 2010).\n\n2.2\n\nChandra X-ray Observations\n\nThe brown dwarfs 2M04414825 and CFHT-BD-Tau 9 have\nbeen observed with Chandra/ ACIS-S in the very faint\nmode, using the back-illuminated CCD S3 (OBSID 12335\nand 12336; P.I. Riaz). Data reduction has been made with\nCIAO 4.3 packages (Fruscione et al. 2006). The level 2 events\nfiles have been obtained from the level 1 events files retaining only events with grade=0, 2, 3, 4, 6, status = 0, energy ranging from 0.3 keV to 8.0 keV, and removing the\nevents position randomization introduced by the Standard\nData Processing, using the tasks acis process events and\ndmcopy. We calculated the exposure maps with the merge\nall task.\nThe source detection has been performed with PWDetect (Damiani et al. 1997), using a threshold of 4.8\u03c3sky , corresponding to one spurious source for each exposure. Both\ntargets have an X-ray counterpart, with an offset equal to\n0.22\u2032\u2032 (CFHT-BD-Tau 9) and 0.14\u2032\u2032 (2M04414825). CFHTBD-Tau 9 is a weak source with a significance of 6, while\n2M04414825 has a bright counterpart (significance > 50 ).\nPhotons extraction has been made using the IDL software ACIS Extract1 (AE, Broos et al. 2002), which uses\nTARA2 , CIAO, FTOOLS3 and MARX4 . AE calculates the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) for each source, and the source\nevents are extracted in a region encompassing the 90% of the\nPSF evaluated at 1.49 keV. Background events have been\nextracted for each source in circular annuli centered on the\nsources, wich have been masked first covering the 99% of the\nlocal PSF and then redefining a more accurate mask region.\nThe X-ray counterpart of 2M04414825 is bright enough\nto determine its parameters (the hydrogen column along\nthe line of sight, nH and the emitting plasma temperature,\nkT ) fitting the observed spectra using XSPEC5 v.12.6.0\n(Arnaud 1996). We assumed a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium thermal model, with one temperature.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n3\n\nThe best fit model (\u03c72\u03bd = 0.93) is a 1T thermal model with\nkT = 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 keV and NH = 0.36 \u00b1 0.09 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ,\ncorresponding to a visual extinction of AV = 2.01, compatible with previous estimates of the extinction of Taurus\nmembers (e.g., Luhman et al. 2010). Using the 1T model\nand adopting a distance of 2M04414825 equal to 140pc\n(Kenyon et al. 1994), we obtained an X-ray luminosity equal\nto log (LX ) = 30.31 erg/s.\nThe few counts detected from the X-ray counterpart of\nCFHT-BD-Tau 9 prevent us to perform a spectral fitting. In\norder to estimate the X-ray luminosity of this source, we set\nnH to the value derived from the typical extinction of Taurus\nmembers (AV = 2\u00b11), corresponding to NH = 0.36\u00b10.09\u00d7\n1022 cm\u22122 . We adopt a coronal temperature of kT = 1 keV\nand find a conversion factor (PIMMS) of 3.9*10\u221212 ergcm\u22122 ,\nthat translates in log(LX ) = 28.30 erg cm\u22122 . Note that the\nconversion factor may vary not more than 20% in the 2MK 20 MK range, while the statistical error (\u223c 40% ) dominate\nthe final uncertainty in Lx. Table 1 lists the properties of\nthe X-ray counterparts of the two brown dwarfs described\nin this section.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nANALYSIS\nModeling of Silicate Emission Spectra\n\nThe 10 and 20\u03bcm features probe the surface layers at different radii in the disk. For a typical T Tauri disk, 95% of\nthe flux at 10\u03bcm comes from within \u223c1 AU, while 95% of\nthe 20\u03bcm flux comes from within \u223c10 AU (Kessler-Silacci\net al. 2006). Thus with a factor of \u223c2 increase in the peak\nwavelength of the silicate feature (10\u03bcm to 20\u03bcm), there is\na shift by a factor of \u223c10 in the disk radii from which most\nof the emission arises. There is a difference in the location\nof the silicate emission zone for stars of different luminosities. For a brown dwarf disk, 95% flux at 10\u03bcm arises from\nsmaller radii of 60.1 AU, while 95% flux at 20\u03bcm arises from\nradii within \u223c1-2 AU (Kessler-Silacci et al. 2007; Bouy et\nal. 2008). For any system, both silicate features probe the\nsurface layers of the disk. For a young brown dwarf disk,\nthe location of the 20\u03bcm silicate emission zone at relatively\nlarger disk radii implies cooler surface temperatures of <100\nK, while smaller radii of 60.1 AU probed by the 10\u03bcm feature imply warmer surface temperatures of 300 K or higher\n(e.g., Mer\u0131\u0301n et al. 2007). At the inner edge of the disk close\nto the central substellar source, dust sublimation temperatures of \u223c1500 K can be reached (e.g., Whitney et al. 2003).\nDue to this, the silicate emission zone probed by the 10\u03bcm\nfeature is usually referred to as the 'warm' or 'inner' component of the disk, while the region probed by the 20\u03bcm\nfeature is referred to as the 'cold' or 'outer' component. The\ndust temperature, however, is not expected to be constant\nand could vary by more than a \u223c100 K over a certain silicate\nemission zone.\nWe used a similar method as described in R09 to model\nthe 20\u03bcm silicate emission features for the targets. Five dust\nspecies were considered in order to obtain a compositional\nhttp://www2.astro.psu.edu/xray/docs/TARA/ae users guide.html\nfit to the observed spectra: amorphous olivine and pyroxhttp://www.astro.psu.edu/xray/docs/TARA\nene, crystalline enstatite, crystalline forsterite, and silica.\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools\nThe characteristics of these are outlined in Table 2, and the\nhttp://space.mit.edu/CXC/MARX/\nspectral profiles plotted in Fig. 1. The bulk densities listed\nhttp://heasarc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/\n\n\f4\n\nRiaz et al.\n\nin Table 2 have been obtained from Bouwman et al. (2001).\nThe amorphous grains show little dependence on shape (e.g.,\nBouwman et al. 2001), and thus can be assumed to be homogeneous and spherical so that the standard Mie theory\ncan be applied to determine their spectroscopic properties.\nThe properties of crystalline silicates however are sensitive\nto the grain shape which makes it important to consider\nshapes other than homogeneous spheres. Min et al. (2003)\nhave studied the absorption and scattering properties of particles that are inhomogeneous in structure and composition,\nbased on the assumption that the characteristics of such irregularly shaped particles can be simulated by the average\nproperties for a distribution of shapes, such as ellipsoids,\nspheroids or hollow spheres. We considered both the distribution of hollow spheres (DHS) and the continuous distribution of ellipsoids (CDE) from Min et al. (2003), and found\na better match both in terms of the location and width of\nthe spectral profiles using the CDE routine. Therefore the\nabsorption efficiencies of crystalline silicates (enstatite and\nforsterite) and silica have been calculated using ellipsoidal\ngrains. Since the CDE method has been used, the grains are\ntreated in the \"Rayleigh limit\", i.e. the grain sizes are assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength of radiation.\nOur model is therefore biased towards sub-micron (0.1 \u03bcm)\nsized crystalline grains, and the effects of grain growth could\nnot be studied for these species. For the case of amorphous\nsilicates, two grain sizes of 0.1 and 2.0 \u03bcm have been used.\nAs discussed in Bouwman et al. (2001), the optical properties of dust grains with a range in sizes between 0.01 and 5\n\u03bcm can be characterized by two typical grain sizes: 0.1 \u03bcm\nfor \"small\" grains with sizes < 1 \u03bcm, and 2.0 \u03bcm for \"large\"\ngrains with sizes >1 \u03bcm.\nTo construct a model spectrum, we have followed the\nmethod outlined in R09 and Honda et al. (2003), wherein\na power-law source function is assumed and the model flux\nF\u03bb is the sum of the emission from a featureless power-law\ncontinuum and the emission from the different dust species.\nWe have considered a power-law continuum since it represents a sum of blackbody emission at various temperatures.\nIt is unlikely for the dust temperature to remain constant\nover a \u223c20\u03bcm wide spectral range. A power-law continuum\nprovides a better approximation than using a single blackbody function at a fixed temperature to fit the continuum.\nThe model spectrum can be written as:\n\n\u03bbF\u03bb = a0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\n20\u03bcm\n\n\u0013n\n\n+ (a1 Q0.1ao + a2 Q2.0ao\n\n+ a3 Q0.1ap + a4 Q2.0ap + a5 Qens + a6 Qf ors\n+ a7 Qsil )\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\n20\u03bcm\n\n\u0013m\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Q0.1ao and Q2.0ao are the absorption efficiencies for\n0.1 and 2.0 \u03bcm amorphous olivine, Q0.1ap and Q2.0ap are\nthe absorption efficiencies for 0.1 and 2.0 \u03bcm amorphous\npyroxene, and Qens , Qf ors, and Qsil are the absorption efficiencies for enstatite, forsterite and silica, respectively. The\nfree parameters in the model are the multiplicative factors\na1 -a7 in 10\u221214 W m\u22122 , and two spectral indices of the source\nfunction, m and n. To correctly define the continuum level,\nwe fixed the parameter a0 to the observed flux density at\n14-15.5\u03bcm. We selected this wavelength range to be the\n\ncontinuum-fiting region as it is least affected by features\nin the spectra. To fit the model spectrum, we used the \u03c72 minimization method outlined in van Boekel et al. (2005).\nThe best-fit values thus obtained for the multiplicative factors were used to derive the mass fractions. Table 3 lists\nthe mass fractions for the amorphous and crystalline silicates. The 10\u03bcm mass fractions are from R09. The uncertainties for the fit parameters were obtained by considering\nthe errors on the observed fluxes, as well as the S/N ratio.\nThe errors on the observed fluxes are between \u223c1-8% of the\nobserved flux density, but are higher (15-20%) in the \u223c3035\u03bcm wavelength range. We used the Monte Carlo method\nfor error estimation as outlined in van Boekel et al. (2005),\nand discussed further in Juhasz et al. (2009). In this method,\nrandom Gaussian noise is added to the spectrum, with 1000\nsynthetic spectra generated and fitted at each noise level. We\nconsidered four different noise levels with a F\u03bderror /F\u03bdobserved\nof 0.2, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001, corresponding to a S/N ratio of\n5, 10, 100 and 1000, respectively. The mean of the resulting distribution of all fit parameters then corresponds to the\nbest-fit value, and the errors are derived from the standard\ndeviation.\nIn order to validate our method, we modeled some\nknown low-mass young objects and compared our results\nwith those published in the literature. Our mass fractions\nare consistent with the fractions reported by Sargent et al.\n(2009a) for T Tauri disks in Taurus. These authors have\nalso considered sub-micron sized crystalline grains in their\nmodel, and have used the CDE distribution for grain opacities, similar to the distribution used in our model. As\ndiscussed in R09 and Sargent et al. (2009a), large grains\ncan be considered as heterogenous aggregates, made up of\nsub-micron sized amorphous silicates, forsterite or enstatite,\nwith the highest abundance of amorphous grains. The opacities of the forsterite components of such large heterogenous\ngrains have been shown by Min et al. (2008) to resemble\nthe opacity of small homogenous forsterite grains, whereas\nthe opacity of the amorphous component of the aggregate\nis found to resemble that of large amorphous homogenous\ngrains, with a size comparable to that of the heterogenous\naggregate. Therefore modeling the crystalline component of\na large heterogenous aggregate with small crystalline grains\nshould not result in largely erroneous mass fractions for the\ncrystalline silicates. This is consistent, for e.g., with the findings of Bouwman et al. (2008), who have considered three\ndifferent grain sizes of 0.1, 1.5 and 6.0 \u03bcm in their models,\nbut find the typical sizes from the model fits to be submicron for the crystalline silicates, and 6 \u03bcm for the amorphous grains. We modeled some of the forsterite exemplars\nfrom the study of Sargent et al. (2009a), such as DK Tau\nand GN Tau. We find a crystalline mass fraction of 38\u00b110%\nand 55\u00b112% for DK Tau and GN Tau, respectively, with\na small and large amorphous grain mass fraction of 12\u00b18%\nand 42\u00b113% for DK Tau and 20\u00b110% and 7\u00b15% for GN\nTau. For sources such as DM Tau or DO Tau that show\nnegligible signs of grain growth in the disk, we find a small\ngrain mass fraction of \u223c80-82% and a crystalline fraction of\n15\u00b19%, with a large-grain fraction of <5%. These fractions\nare consistent within the uncertainties with the values listed\nin Sargent et al. (2009a) for the cold component of the disk.\nWe also modeled the Taurus brown dwarf 2M04442713\ndiscussed in Bouy et al. (2008), and obtained a large-grain\n\n\fThe radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks\nand a crystalline mass fraction of 68\u00b18% and 30\u00b111%, respectively. These values are consistent with the mass fractions listed in Bouy et al. (2008) for the low-temperature\npolynomial continuum case. For the very low-mass star SSTLup3-1 discussed in Mer\u0131\u0301n et al. (2007), we find a crystalline\nand large-grain mass fraction of 38\u00b113% and 22\u00b110%, respectively, which are comparable to the fractions reported\nby these authors for the high-continuum case. We note that\na direct comparison of our results with those reported in\nBouy et al. and Mer\u0131\u0301n et al. is not appropriate, since these\nworks have considered a different set of grain opacities (the\nDHS model), and therefore the input optical constants are\ndifferent than the ones considered in our model.\n3.2\n\nDisk Modeling\n\nWe have used the 2-D radiative transfer code by Whitney\net al. (2003) for disk modeling. The circumstellar geometry consists of a rotationally flattened infalling envelope,\nbipolar cavities, and a flared accretion disk in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The disk density is proportional to \u031f \u2212\u03b1 , where\n\u031f is the radial coordinate in the disk midplane, and \u03b1 is\nthe radial density exponent. The disk scale height increases\nwith radius, h = h0 (\u031f/R\u2217 )\u03b2 , where h0 is the scale height\nat R\u2217 and \u03b2 is the flaring power. For the stellar parameters, we used the Tef f -SpT relation from Luhman et al.\n(2003) to determine the stellar effective temperature. We\nhave considered an age of \u223c1 Myr for the Taurus-Auriga\ncluster (Kenyon & Hartmann 1995). The stellar mass and\nradius were obtained by considering the 1 Myr isochrone\nfrom Baraffe et al. (2003). The NextGen (Hauschildt et al.\n1999) atmosphere file for the appropriate Tef f and log g =\n3.5 was used to fit the atmosphere spectrum of the central\nsub-stellar source. A distance of 140 pc (Kenyon et al. 1994)\nwas used to scale the output fluxes from the models to the\nluminosity and distance of the brown dwarfs.\nFigure 2 (right panel) shows the disk model fits obtained\nfor the targets. Also indicated are the separate contributions\nfrom the disk and the stellar photosphere. The Spitzer IRAC\nand MIPS data points shown in the fit are from Luhman et\nal. (2010), the near-infrared points are the 2MASS data, and\nthe optical data has been obtained from SIMBAD. Detailed\ndiscussions on the fitting procedure and the variations in the\nmodel SEDs with the different disk parameters are provided\nin Riaz & Gizis (2007). Here we provide a brief description\nof the best model-fits (based on the lowest reduced-\u03c72 value)\nobtained for these brown dwarfs.\nThe disk models provide the capability to include different grains in different disk regions (see Whitney et al. 2003,\nFig. 1). There are three grain models supplied by the code:\n'large' grains with a size distribution that decays exponentially for sizes larger than 50 \u03bcm up to 1 mm, the 'medium'\nsized grains of sizes with amax \u223c 1 \u03bcm, and 'small' ISMlike grains with amax \u223c 0.25 \u03bcm. All three models consider\na minimum grain size of 0.0025\u03bcm. The large-grain model\nused by Whitney et al. (2003) is the same as used by Wood et\nal. (2002) to fit the HH 30 disk SED. The medium grain size\ndistribution is the same grain model that Cotera et al. (2001)\nhave used to model the HH 30 near-IR scattered light images. The ISM grain model is the same as used by Kim et al.\n(1994) from their mass distribution for the fit to the canonical (Rv =3.1) average diffuse ISM. All three models are based\n\n5\n\non the method of a power-law with exponential decay (PED)\nabove some cutoff grain size ac , as discussed in Kim et al.\n(1994; Equation 3) and Wood et al. (2002; Equation 4). For\nthe large grain model, the values for the exponents p and q\nof the PED are 3 and 0.6, respectively, and the cutoff and\nmaximum grain sizes are ac =50\u03bcm and amax =1000\u03bcm. For\nthe medium grain size model, q=1, p=3.5, ac =0.55\u03bcm and\namax =20\u03bcm. For the diffuse ISM model, ac =0.02\u03bcm and\namax =0.25\u03bcm, with the PED exponent \u03b3= -3.06 for silicate\ngrains (Eqn. 3 of Kim et al. 1994).\nWe have varied these grain models in the disk midplane\nand the upper atmosphere in order to obtain a good fit to the\nsilicate emission features and the overall SED. The model\nused here assigns large grains to the high density regions.\nDue to this, when large grains are used in the disk midplane,\nsimilar grains are placed close to the inner wall since it is of\nhigh density. This affects the emission from the inner wall\nand hence the observed flux at 10\u03bcm. Thus by using submicron sized grains in the disk midplane, we have indirectly\nreduced the inner wall grain size, and were able to obtain\na good fit to the 10\u03bcm silicate feature. There could still be\nbigger grains in the really dense midplane region of the disk,\nthe presence of which can be confirmed with far-IR/submm observations. On the other hand, if this were a \"threelayered\" disk model instead of a \"two-layered\" one, large\ngrains could be placed in the very dense regions without\naffecting the 10\u03bcm feature. For most sources, good fits are\nobtained if sub-micron sized grains are placed in both the\nmidplane and the disk surface layers. This produces a model\nSED with a more peaked emission at 10\u03bcm and a steeper\nslope at far-infrared/sub-mm wavelengths (e.g., Riaz & Gizis\n2007). For MHO 5 that has a very flat disk structure, the\nlarge grain model with amax of 1 mm was considered in\nboth the disk midplane and the atmosphere. This results\nin a flat silicate feature as well as a flat sub-mm slope in\nthe model SED. Considering that we do not have any farinfrared/sub-mm observations for these objects, the silicate\nfeatures provide the only way to constrain the different grain\nsizes considered by these disk models.\nThere are degeneracies in the disk model fits presented\nhere, considering that we have only \u223c5-38\u03bcm data to model\nthese disks. The uncertainties in the stellar parameters could\nalso result in changes in the disk parameters. There are\nmainly six parameters related to the disk emission in these\nmodels, that can be varied to obtain a good fit. We had fixed\nthe disk mass and the outer disk radius given the absence\nof longer wavelength data. The disk outer radius was fixed\nat 100 AU, and the disk mass for modeling was set to 1E4M\u2299 . This is the typical disk mass obtained by Scholz et\nal. (2006) from 1.3 mm observations for a sample of Taurus\nbrown dwarfs. We had fixed the disk mass accretion rate\nat 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr \u22121 , a typical value observed among accreting\nT Tauri stars (e.g., Muzerolle et al. 2003). It is, however,\npossible to constrain the amount of flaring in the disk, the\ninclination angle, and the inner disk radius, using the available observations.\nThe disk scale height varies as h = h0 (\u031f/R\u2217 )\u03b2 , where\nh0 is the scale height at R\u2217 and \u03b2 is the flaring power. We\nvaried both h0 and \u03b2 to determine the amount of flaring in\nthese disks. The variations in the model SEDs as \u03b2 is lowered\nare more evident for \u03bb > 10 \u03bcm, and the 24 \u03bcm observation\nprovides a good constraint to the flaring power. The model\n\n\f6\n\nRiaz et al.\n\nSED is highly flared for \u03b2=1.25, which is considered a typical\nvalue for models of T Tauri disks in hydrostatic equilibrium\n(e.g., Walker et al. 2004), while the structure is flat for \u03b2=1.0\nor smaller values (e.g., Riaz & Gizis 2007). For most sources,\nwe were able to obtain good fits using \u03b261.1 and h0 <1,\nindicating flat structures for these brown dwarf disks.\nWe have explored a range of inclination angles to the\nline of sight. Due to binning of photons in the models, there\nare a total of 10 viewing angles, with face-on covering 0-18\u25e6\ninclinations. The mid- and far-IR fluxes increase with decreasing inclinations, as the emission at these wavelengths\nis from an optically thick disk, while the optically thin millimeter fluxes are independent of the inclination (e.g., Riaz &\nGizis 2007). We obtained good fits using intermediate inclinations of 50-60\u25e6 for most disks (with a \u00b110\u25e6 uncertainty).\nA few disks including V410 X-ray 6 are at a larger inclinations of >70\u25e6 and can be considered as edge-on systems.\nFour disks including MHO 5 were fitted well using face-on\ninclinations of <40\u25e6 , although MHO 5 has a very flat disk\nand the inclination would not really matter for such a flat\nsystem.\nThe inner disk radius, Rin , was varied as multiples\nof Rsub , where Rsub is the dust sublimation radius and\nvaries with the stellar radius and temperature, Rsub =\nR\u2217 (Tsub /T\u2217 )\u22122.085 (Whitney et al. 2003). Tsub is the dust\nsublimation temperature and was set to 1600K. Increasing\nthe inner radius to 5 or 7Rsub results in higher fluxes near the\n10 \u03bcm silicate band and at longer wavelengths. For nearly\nall disks, we found a good fit using Rin = 1 Rsub (\u223c0.0004\nAU). For the transition disk V410 X-ray 6, a larger inner\ndisk radius of \u223c0.05 AU provided a good fit. The best-fit\nvalues for these parameters are listed in Table 3.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS\nThe least processed disks: V410 X-ray 6 and\n2M04141760\n\nThe brown dwarfs 2M04141760 and V410 X-ray 6 show a\nvery smooth 20\u03bcm feature, with a peak near \u223c18\u03bcm that is\nindicative of small amorphous olivine grains (Fig. 2a). The\n10\u03bcm spectra for both of these sources are also quite smooth\nwith a peak at \u223c9.8\u03bcm indicative of small amorphous olivine\ngrains, and no clear crystalline peaks are observed. We find\na high small-grain mass fraction of >65% in these disks,\nfrom both the 10 and 20\u03bcm features, with a <5% fraction\nof crystalline grains and <15% fraction of large grains. The\ninner and outer regions of these disks thus show weak signs\nof dust processing.\nThe amount of crystalline silicates in a disk could be\ndependent on the presence of dense disk material in the inner disk regions. If crystalline silicates form due to thermal\nannealing of amorphous grains in the warm inner disk regions, and then radially transported to the outer disk, then\nthe presence of an inner hole in the disk could result in a\nreduction in the crystalline silicate production. This may be\nthe case for V410 X-ray 6. This brown dwarf has a transition disk and displays photospheric emission up to wavelengths of \u223c8\u03bcm (Fig. 2a). From disk modeling, we estimate\nan inner disk hole of \u223c118 Rsub (\u223c0.05 AU). In comparison,\n2M04141760 has a much smaller inner disk radius of \u223c3 Rsub\n\n(\u223c0.001 AU), but exhibits a similar lack of crystallinity in\nthe disk. No clear correlation is thus seen between the presence of a large inner hole and low crystallinity in the disk.\nThe disk for V410 X-ray 6 flares up at wavelengths longward of \u223c15\u03bcm (Fig. 2a). Watson et al. (2009) find a trend\nin the Taurus T Tauri sample of more flattened disks having greater crystallinity. Also, Sargent et al. (2009a) find a\npossible weak trend in a similar sample of flattened disks\ntending to have higher large grain mass fractions. The lack\nof crystallinity in V410 X-ray 6 is consistent with a flared\ngeometry, indicating that the correlations noted by Watson\net al. and Sargent et al. are also applicable to the sub-stellar\ncases. As mentioned, the sub-micron amorphous grain fraction for V410 X-ray 6 and 2M04141760 is quite high (>60%),\nand the large-grain mass fraction is only 15% or less. These\ndisks are at an early stage of evolution and significant dust\nprocessing has not yet occurred. This is more apparent from\nthe SED for 2M04141760 that shows a strong excess emission even at 3.6\u03bcm. Among the 65 T Tauri systems in Taurus\nstudied by Sargent et al. (2009a) and Watson et al. (2009),\n5% are found to have high mass fractions of amorphous submicron grains >70%, with weak signs of crystalline or large\nsilicates. We have a \u223c15% fraction of such systems in our\nTaurus brown dwarf sample that are still dominated by ISMlike grains.\nThe one property that is found to be different for these\ntwo sources is X-ray variability. Both V410 X-ray 6 and\n2M04141760 show strong variations in X-ray emission, and\nhave been classified as X-ray flaring sources (Grosso et al.\n2007). In R09, we had noted a weak anti-correlation between\nthe X-ray emission strength and the extent of crystallinity\nin the disk, suggesting that X-ray activity could affect the\ncrystalline structure of the dust grains. We discuss this further in Section \u00a75.3.\n4.2\n\nThe mixed composition disk: 2M04141188\n\n2M04141188 shows an interesting 20\u03bcm spectrum, with\nweak emission between \u223c25 and 30\u03bcm. The spectrum shows\na broad peak near \u223c20\u03bcm, and then a rise in emission\nlongward of \u223c30\u03bcm. There may be a smaller peak near\n\u223c33\u03bcm due to crystalline forsterite, although it may well be\nconsistent with the point-to-point noise around that wavelength range. The broad feature near 20\u03bcm is well fit using a model with a mixture of small amorphous and crystalline enstatite and forsterite grains, along with some contribution from amorphous silica. The 10\u03bcm spectrum for\n2M04141188 shows a broad, trapezoidal shape with a crystalline forsterite peak near 11.3\u03bcm. Such shapes are indicative of grain growth and crystallization in the disk. We find\nroughly equal mass fractions of \u223c30-50% for the small and\nlarge amorphous, and the crystalline silicate grains. The\nfractions are similar in the inner and outer disk regions.\nThis disk thus exhibits a mixed composition in both the\nwarm and cold disk regions.\nThe 'dip' observed in the 20\u03bcm spectrum between \u223c25\nand 30\u03bcm could be due to obstruction by the bright edge\nof the disk. The best-fit disk model for 2M04141188 indicates a close to edge-on inclination of i \u223c 70\u25e6 (Table 3).\nAn absorption+emission silicate spectrum is sometimes observed for highly inclined disks, and can be explained by\nsilicate emission from the disk and silicate absorption from\n\n\fThe radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks\nthe highly extinguished wall of the disk (e.g., Luhman et al.\n2007). While we do not actually see an absorption component for 2M04141188 since the full spectrum lies above the\ncontinuum (Fig 2), the lack of emission indicates larger optical depth in this small disk region, which could be due to the\ndisk's self-absorption at the nearside of the disk. However, if\ndisk self-absorption is evident even at such long wavelengths,\none may naturally expect that much more extinction should\nbe observed at much shorter wavelength, which is not seen.\nIt may be that significant dust sedimentation has occurred\nin this disk region, resulting in the weak emission observed.\n4.3\n\nProminent crystalline forsterite features:\n2M04230607, CFHT-BD-Tau 20 and\n2M04400067\n\nThe 20\u03bcm spectrum for 2M04230607 shows prominent crystalline forsterite features at \u223c23.8, 27.5 and 34\u03bcm. There is\nanother feature observed near \u223c16\u03bcm which is also indicative of forsterite emission (Fi.g 1). In comparison, the 10\u03bcm\nspectrum for 2M04230607 shows a peak near \u223c9.3\u03bcm which\nindicates enstatite emission, while a smaller forsterite peak\nis observed at \u223c11.3\u03bcm. The crystalline mass fraction for\n2M04230607 shows an increase from \u223c38% in the warm inner disk region to \u223c57% in the outer cold region. If we look\nat the separate contribution from enstatite and forsterite silicates, then the enstatite mass fraction has decreased by a\nfactor of \u223c2 in the outer disk, while the forsterite fraction\nhas increased by a factor of \u223c3. Such gradients in the dust\nchemical composition in the inner and outer disk regions\nhave been noted before in disks around solar-type stars and\nHerbig Ae/Be stars (e.g., van Boekel et al. 2004; Bouwman\net al. 2008). 2M04230607 provides a similar interesting case\namong brown dwarf disks. We discuss the formation mechanism of the different kinds of crystalline silicates in Section\n\u00a75.4.\nThe 20\u03bcm spectrum for CFHT-BD-Tau 20 also shows\na forsterite feature near 34\u03bcm. There is a smaller peak\nobserved near 27\u03bcm which is also indicative of forsterite\nemission. The 10\u03bcm spectrum is very weak for this object\n(Fig. 2b), but much stronger emission is observed in the\n20\u03bcm feature. This suggests the presence of a large mass of\ncold dust in the disk compared to warm dust in the inner regions. We had discussed in R09 the large uncertainties in the\nmodel-fits for the 10\u03bcm spectrum of CFHT-BD-Tau 20 and\nthe derived mass fractions. The lack of warm dust emission\nmakes it difficult to compare the inner and outer disk mass\nfractions. From the 20\u03bcm model fits, we find a 37% crystalline mass fraction and a 46% fraction of large amorphous\ngrains. It thus exhibits a mixed composition with signs of\nboth grain growth and crystallization in the outer disk. The\nweak emission from inner surface layers could be due to significant grain growth and dust settling in the inner disk regions. This suggests that dust processing may not occur on a\nsimilar timescale in the inner and outer regions for all disks.\nOr there may have been some secondary collisional process\nthat produced this new generation of cold dust in the outer\ndisk regions. CFHT-BD-Tau 20 thus presents an interesting\ncase where the 20\u03bcm emission strength is much higher than\nthat observed in the 10\u03bcm feature, and where large abundances of crystalline silicates are found in the outer cold disk\nregions.\n\n7\n\nA similar case is of 2M04400067 that shows broad\nforsterite features near \u223c27 and 34\u03bcm. Some forsterite emission can also be identified near 16\u03bcm. The 10\u03bcm spectrum\nfor this disk shows a broad trapezoidal shaped feature with\nno prominent crystalline peaks. We find a slight increase in\nthe crystalline fraction from \u223c22% in the warm component\nto \u223c30% in the cold region. The inner disk region, however, shows a high fraction of small amorphous grains, with\na \u223c60% mass fraction, while a high 63% mass fraction is\nfound for the large dust grains in the outer disk region. The\nouter cold component of this disk thus shows stronger signs\nof dust processing due to both grain growth and crystallization processes.\nThe disk model fits for these three disks are shown\nin Fig. 2b (right panel). 2M04230607 shows weak excess emission shortward of \u223c8\u03bcm. CFHT-BD-Tau 20 and\n2M04400067 show stronger excess emission at these short\nwavelengths. The scale height at the inner disk edge is\nslightly higher (by a factor of \u223c1.4) for CFHT-BD-Tau 4\nthan the other two disks. The disk for 2M04400067 shows\nslight flaring longward of \u223c20\u03bcm. For all three disks, the\nbest-fits are obtained using an inner disk radius of 1 Rsub\n(\u223c0.0004 AU) and an intermediate inclination of i \u223c50-60\u25e6 .\n\n4.4\n\nThe four 'outlier' cases: MHO 5,\nCFHT-BD-Tau 8, 2M04290068, 2M04242090\n\nWe have four interesting 'outlier' cases, where the 10\u03bcm feature shows strong silicate emission with a mixed composition\nof small, large and crystalline grains, but the 20\u03bcm features\nare very weak, and it is mainly the underlying continuum\nwhich is detected (Fig. 2c). This indicates significant dust\nprocessing as well as dust settling to the midplane in the\nouter disk regions, while there is still a considerable fraction of warm dust in the inner disk region. For most other\ndisks, we find similar strengths in the 10 and 20\u03bcm features\n(Section \u00a73). We have compared the extent of flaring in the\nouter \u223c15-35 \u03bcm part of the disk for these outliers and the\nother disk sources, and find similar slopes as observed for\nthe rest. The outlier disks are thus not significantly flatter\nthan the other disk sources that show emission in the 20\u03bcm\nfeature (Fig. 3). It may be that some secondary collisional\nprocess has produced this new generation of dust in the inner disk regions, resulting in strong emission at 10\u03bcm, while\ngrains continued to grow and settle in the outer disk. A few\nof such outliers have also been found among T Tauri stars\n(e.g., Kessler-Silacci et al. 2007), and have been explained\nby enhanced dust settling in the outer disk regions. Considering the variety in the disk shapes and structures observed\nat any given age, such outlier cases suggest that dust processing does not occur on a similar timescale in the inner\nand outer regions for all disks.\nResults from disk modeling indicate flat disk structures\nfor all four sources. 2M04290068 shows photospheric emission shortward of \u223c8\u03bcm, and can be classified as a transition\ndisk. From the best-fit model, we estimate an inner disk hole\nof \u223c18 Rsub (\u223c0.006 AU), which is a factor of \u223c10 larger\nthan the inner disk radius estimated for the other 3 sources.\nThis system thus seems devoid of disk material in the inner\nregions of within \u223c0.01 AU, some emission from the warm\nsurface layers is observed at radii of \u223c0.01-0.1 AU, while\n\n\f8\n\nRiaz et al.\n\nthere is an absence of optically thin material at larger radii,\nas indicated by the flat 20\u03bcm feature.\n\n4.5\n\nCFHT-BD-Tau 9, 2M04554801 and GM Tau\n\nFigure 2d shows model fits for disks with comparatively\nweak 20\u03bcm features. The S/N for the 20\u03bcm spectra is quite\nlow (\u223c10). For all three sources, we find very little fraction of small dust grains (<5%) from 20\u03bcm modeling, the\ncrystalline mass fractions are between 20% and 40%, and\nlarge-grain mass fractions are 50-60%. In comparison with\nthe inner disk fractions, all three sources show an increase\nin the large-grain and crystalline mass fractions in the outer\ndisk, while the small grain mass fraction has decreased by\nmore than 30%. These disks are thus dominated by more\nprocessed dust in the outer regions, which is consistent with\nthe flatter shapes observed for the 20\u03bcm features. The bestfit model SED is obtained using an inclination of i \u223c70\u25e6 for\nGM Tau, indicating a close to edge-on disk for this brown\ndwarf. For CFHT-BD-Tau 9 and 2M04554801, a face-on inclination of 30-40\u25e6 provided the best-fit.\nThe 20\u03bcm spectrum for 2M04554801 indicates silica\npeak near 20.8\u03bcm. In our simplistic model, we have only\nconsidered amorphous silica and are able to obtain a good\nfit to this feature. However, detailed modeling such as that\npresented in Sargent et al. (2009b) can correctly identify the\nparticular polymorph of silica present in the disk. We find\na 27% mass fraction for silica from modelling the 20\u03bcm feature, which is the highest silica fraction in the whole sample.\nOverall, we find silica mass fractions between \u223c7% and 14%\nin the outer regions for these brown dwarf disks, with 0% silica fraction found for V410 X-ray 6 and 2M04141760. As discussed in Sargent et al. (2009b), thermal annealing of olivine\nand pyroxene produces forsterite and enstatite, along with\nsilica. This silica will be amorphous if annealing takes place\nat low temperatures (< 1000 K) and for short durations.\nThat is, annealing followed by rapid quenching can produce\namorphous silica, such as obsidian and tektike. Among T\nTauri stars, a few silica exemplars such as ROXs 42C, have\nbeen modeled by Sargent et al. (2009b), using many different forms of silica including obsidian and amorphous silica.\nSargent et al. concluded that annealed silica (a mixture of\nthe two crystalline polymorphs stable at high temperatures\nand low pressures, cristobalite and tridymite) provides the\nbest fitting of model to spectrum, of all the different forms of\nsilica attempted in the models. Annealed silica may also be\nresponsible for the silica feature observed in the 2M04554801\nspectrum. Nevertheless, this object presents a similar silica\nexemplar case among brown dwarfs.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nStrengths and Shapes of the Silicate Features\n\nDisks dominated by pristine ISM-like dust show flared structures, while flatter structures are observed for the ones that\nhave gone through substantial grain processing. The processing of dust into crystalline silicates as well as growth to\nlarger sizes both affect the vertical structure of the disk, as\nwell as the emission strength in the silicate features. Figure 3 compares the strength and shape of the 10 and 20\u03bcm\n\nsilicate features. The shape of the 10\u03bcm feature can be estimated by the parameter S11.3 /S9.8 , which is the ratio of\nthe normalized fluxes at 11.3 and 9.8 \u03bcm (e.g., Bouwman et\nal. 2001). For the 20\u03bcm feature, the shape can be estimated\nby the flux ratio, S23.8 /S19 . The peaks at 19\u03bcm and 23.8\u03bcm\nare the most prominent amorphous and crystalline features,\nrespectively, in the \u223c15-35\u03bcm spectral range (e.g., KesslerSilacci et al. 2006). Typical uncertainties in the flux ratios\nare are \u00b10.1. We have included for comparison the data for\nHerbig Ae/Be stars and T Tauri stars from van Boekel et\nal. (2003), Przygodda et al. (2003) and Kessler-Silacci et al.\n(2005; 2006). The strengths of the features are indicated by\nthe Speak values, as discussed above.\nAn inverse strength-shape correlation can be seen for\nboth the 10 and 20\u03bcm features. The correlation is such\nthat spectra with a larger value for the S11.3 /S9.8 or the\nS23.8 /S19 flux ratio have a lower peak-over-continuum flux.\nThis can be explained by the extent of dust processing in the\ndisk; spectra that are dominated by more processed dust due\nto grain growth and/or crystallization processes are found\nto be flatter with a peak wavelength close to 11.3\u03bcm or\n23.8\u03bcm, while spectra dominated by unprocessed ISM-like\ndust show more peaked, narrower profiles with a peak wavelength closer to 9.8\u03bcm or 19\u03bcm. The strength in the feature\nthus decreases or the feature becomes flatter with increasing\ncrystallinity and/or grain growth in the disk, as indicated by\nthe flux ratios S11.3 /S9.8 and S23.8 /S19 . This is more prominent for disks such as V410 X-ray 6 that show weak signs of\ngrain processing and lie in the lower right part in the plot\n10\n20\n(Speak\nand Speak\n\u223c 1.65). 2M04230607, on the other hand,\nshows strong signs of crystallinity and lies in the upper left\n10\n20\npart, near Speak\n, Speak\n\u223c 1.35, and S11.3 /S9.8 , S23.8 /S19\n\u223c1.05.\nFor both silicate spectra, the brown dwarfs show flatter\nfeatures compared to higher mass T Tauri stars and Herbig\nAe/Be stars. We find a clustering for the brown dwarfs near\n10\n20\nSpeak\n\u223c Speak\n\u223c 1.35. This can be explained by the differences in the location of the silicate emission zone for stars\nof different luminosities. The silicate feature probes smaller\nradii (61 AU) in disks around brown dwarfs than in disks\naround T Tauri stars (610 AU). If crystallization mainly\noccurs through thermal annealing of amorphous silicates at\nhigh temperatures (\u223c800 K), then this process will be more\neffective in the inner warm regions. Also, due to the higher\ndensities in the inner disk, we would expect grain growth\nand dust settling to be more prominent in these regions.\nThus due to the smaller radii probed by the silicate features\naround brown dwarfs, stronger signatures of dust processing\nwould be observed.\nIncreasing dust processing is thus correlated with\nweaker strength in the silicate emission feature. In Figs. 4\nand 5, we have investigated whether the observed flattening and the shift in the peak position of the silicate features\nis due to an increase in the grain sizes or a higher degree\nof crystallinity in the disk. The strength in the 10\u03bcm silicate feature shows no dependence on the crystalline or the\nlarge-grain mass fractions (Fig. 4; left panel). The correlation coefficient is <0.1 for both cases. The 20\u03bcm feature\nstrength shows some correlation with the grain growth levels; we find a correlation coefficient of -0.3, at a confidence\nlevel of 95%. The correlation is weaker for the 20\u03bcm crystalline mass fraction and the 13-35\u03bcm spectral slope (corre-\n\n\fThe radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks\nlation coefficient of -0.15 at 95% confidence level). For the\nfeature shapes (Fig. 5), both the 10\u03bcm large grain and crystalline mass fractions are found to increase as the 11.3 \u03bcm\nflux increases relative to the 9.8 \u03bcm flux. We find a correlation coefficient of 0.4 for both cases at a confidence level of\n92%. For the 20\u03bcm features, crystallization seems to be more\ndominant than grain growth in affecting the feature shape\n(Fig. 5; right panel). The correlation coefficient is 0.34 for\nthe crystallin case (92% confidence level), and 0.02 for the\nlarge-grain mass fractions. The feature shape thus seems to\nbe more strongly linked to the crystallization process, while\nthe strength in the features shows some dependence on the\ngrain growth levels in the disk, at least for the 20\u03bcm case.\nThe trends we have found for brown dwarfs are consistent\nwith the results seen among higher mass objects in Taurus,\nas Watson et al. (2009) report both the shape and strength\nto be strongly linked to the crystallinity in these disks, but\nno strong correlation is found for the large grain abundances.\nFigure 6 shows a comparison of the crystalline and\nlarge-grain mass fractions with the extent of flaring in the\ninner and outer disk regions. The extent of flaring in a given\ndisk region can be estimated by the spectral index (\u03b1) of the\nderived continuum from the 10 and 20\u03bcm features, using the\nmethod defined in Kessler-Silacci et al. (2006). In our definition of \u03b1, a more positive value implies higher flaring in\nthe disk. The 10\u03bcm crystalline mass fractions show a dependence on the 8-13\u03bcm spectral slope. We find a correlation\ncoefficient of -0.4 at a 90% confidence level. In comparison,\nthe correlation coefficient is nearly zero for the large-grain\nmass fractions. In the outer disk regions, both crystallization\nand grain growth seem to be effective in causing flattening\nin the disk. As mentioned, with the exception of V410 X-ray\n6, the brown dwarf disks in our sample have flat structures,\nwith similar 15-35\u03bcm spectral slopes of \u223c -0.5. Due to the\nlarge spread in the mass fractions for similar spectral slopes,\nthe correlation coefficients for the 20\u03bcm case are small (\u223c\n-0.1). Sargent et al. (2009a) and Watson et al. (2009) have\nfound that the T Tauri disks with the bluest continua at\n6-to-13\u03bcm and 13-to-31\u03bcm wavelengths (the ones with the\nlowest flaring) tend to have the largest crystalline and large\ngrain mass fractions. A number of T Tauri stars in the Watson et al and Sargent et al samples are found to have flared\ndisks, resulting in a large range in the spectral indices, which\nmakes it easier to identify the possible trends between the\ndisk geometry and the mass fractions. Despite the lack of\nany strong correlations for the brown dwarfs, we find the\nstrengths/shapes and the extent of flattening in these disks\nto be affected by both the crystallization and grain growth\nprocesses.\nThe dust settling and sedimentation process resulting in\nflattening of a disk may also be affected by the level of turbulence in the disk. In disks with higher accretion rates, turbulent mixing may occur alongside grain growth and prolong\nthe timescales over which large grains settle to the optically\nthick disk midplane (e.g., Dullemond & Dominik 2004). In\nFig. 7, there may be some dependence of the grain growth\nlevel in the inner disk region on the accretion rate (correlation coefficient = -0.3); MHO 5 and 2M04414825 are among\nthe weakly accreting systems, but show high grain growth\nlevels with \u223c70% mass fractions. 2M04141760 is the most\nactively accreting system in the sample and also has the\nmost least processed disk. CFHT-BD-Tau 6, on the other\n\n9\n\nhand, is also a weakly accreting system but has a largegrain fraction similar to 2M04141760. The accretion rates\nhave been obtained from Muzerolle et al. (2003; 2005). For\nthe case of the 10\u03bcm crystalline mass fraction, 2M04141760\nis again the only outskirt in the figure, and ignoring this\npoint would result in a flat distribution or a zero correlation coefficient. A flattened disk due to either grain growth\nand/or crystallization does not necessarily imply a weakly\naccreting system. However, as noted earlier, nearly all disks\nin our sample have flattened disks, irrespective of the accretion rate or the mass fractions. In the outer disk region, we\nfind similar levels of grain growth and crystallinity for log \u1e40\nbetween \u223c-8 and -10.5 M\u2299 yr \u22121 . The number of known\nTaurus brown dwarfs with accretion rate measurements is\nsmall. A larger number of data points would be valuable to\ninvestigate any dependence on the mass accretion rate.\n5.2\n\nInner vs. Outer Disk Evolution: Dependence\non Stellar Mass\n\nIn Figure 8, we have compared the 10 and 20\u03bcm mass fractions for the small and large amorphous grains, and the\ncrystalline silicates. Also included for comparison is data\nfor 65 T Tauri disks in Taurus from Sargent et al. (2009a).\nThe T Tauri sample covers spectral types (SpT) between K5\nand M5, which would imply stellar masses between \u223c1 and\n0.1M\u2299 (using Baraffe et al. 2003 evolutionary models for an\nage of \u223c1 Myr). Our brown dwarf sample consists of a narrow range in SpT between M5 and M7, implying masses of\n\u223c0.1-0.04M\u2299 . There is thus no age effect involved in making such a comparison as all sources are presumably at the\nage of Taurus (\u223c1 Myr). For the Taurus brown dwarfs, more\nthan half of the disks show negligible mass fractions for small\namorphous grains in the outer disk regions. We find just two\nsources that show >50% small grain mass fractions in both\nthe warm and cold components. These are the two least\nprocessed disks discussed in Section \u00a74.1. In comparison, a\nmajority of T Tauri disks have small amorphous grain fractions of >50% in the cold component, and in some cases\nthese are much higher than the fractions obtained from the\ninner disk. In comparing the grain growth levels, most brown\ndwarfs show higher large-grain mass fractions in the outer\ndisk. We have six sources that have 10\u03bcm large-grain fractions of <20%, while the outer disk fractions have increased\nto >20%. Three other brown dwarfs show similar large-grain\nmass fractions of \u223c40% in the warm and cold components.\nAmong the T Tauri sample, nearly all disks show an absence of grain growth in the outer disk region, with a 20\u03bcm\nlarge-grain mass fraction of <1%.\nIf we compare the crystalline levels (Fig. 8; bottom\npanel), then the T Tauri stars show a large clustering near\n\u223c10% fraction, and almost the full sample has a crystalline\nmass fraction of 620% both in the inner and outer disk\nregions. The T Tauri distribution also shows two 'tails' of\nsources with negligible outer disk crystallinity but significant inner disk crystalline mass fractions, and vice versa.\nAmong the brown dwarfs, we find some correlation in the\nwarm and cold crystalline mass fractions, with more than\nhalf of the sample showing similar fractions of \u223c20-60% at\nboth 10 and 20\u03bcm. The two brown dwarfs with lower crystalline fractions (<20%) are the two least processed disks of\nV410 X-ray 6 and 2M04141760. The solid line in Fig. 8c is\n\n\f10\n\nRiaz et al.\n\na straight line fit to the brown dwarfs and has a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.5. There is thus (weak) evidence that crystallinity increases linearly from the inner to the outer disk\nregions for brown dwarfs.\nThe dependence of the 20\u03bcm mass fractions on the stellar mass can be seen in Fig. 9. There is a lack of later type\nstars with disks that have abundant small grains, and there\nis a lack of later type stars with negligible crystalline and\nlarge grain mass fractions. We find a mean 20\u03bcm small, large\nand crystalline mass fraction of 17.2%, 43.1% and 30.3%, respectively, for the brown dwarfs. In comparison, the higher\nmass star sample has a mean 20\u03bcm small, large and crystalline mass fraction of 62.2%, 14.7% and 16.1%, respectively. There is thus a factor of \u223c2-3 increase in the grain\ngrowth and crystallinity levels in the cold disk regions for\nlater type stars, while the fraction of small amorphous grains\nhas decreased by a factor of \u223c4.\nWe thus find two possible trends from our analysis:\nbrown dwarfs show stronger signs of dust processing, in\nterms of the large-grain and crystalline mass fractions, in\nthe outer disk compared to the inner disk regions, and, the\nextent of dust processing in the cold component is more significant for the sub-stellar disks compared to the T Tauri\nstars. The trend is more prominent if we consider the four\noutlier cases discussed in Section \u00a74.4, that show significant\ngrain growth and dust settling in the outer disk regions.\nWatson et al (2009) find a trend in the Taurus T Tauri\nsample of more flattened disks having greater crystallinity.\nSargent et al (2009a) also find a possible weak trend in a similar sample of flattened disks tending to have higher large\ngrain mass fractions. For nearly all of our targets, we find a\nflat disk structure, and so stronger signs of dust processing\nin terms of higher crystalline and large-grain mass fractions\ncan be expected. V410 X-ray 6 shows a comparatively flared\ndisk structure and has the least processed disk, so the correlation noted by Watson et al. and Sargent et al. also holds\ntrue for the sub-stellar cases. Increasing grain growth in the\nouter disk also suggests that we are looking at a denser region at larger radii for the brown dwarfs, as discussed in\nSection \u00a73. If the 20\u03bcm feature probes lower scale heights or\na deeper layer in brown dwarf disks than the surface layers\nor larger scale heights in T Tauri disks, then we would expect to see grains of larger sizes due to larger density and\ndust settling for the case of the brown dwarfs. This difference\nin the disk scale height could also explain the exceptionally\nhigh fractions of small dust grains in the cold component of\nthe T Tauri disks (Fig. 9), which are nearly negligible for the\ncase of the brown dwarfs. Small dust grains should be more\nabundant at larger radii due to decreased densities, but this\nabundance would decrease with decreasing scale height in\nthe disk, at a given disk radius. We can expect stronger signs\nof crystallinity in brown dwarf disks compared to T Tauri\ndisks, primarily because the silicate emitting region would\nlie very close to the central source in brown dwarfs. Using\na simple estimation, if the stellar mass drops by an order\nof magnitude (1 M\u2299 \u2013> 0.1 M\u2299 ), the disk radius at which\nannealing temperatures can be reached will be located 10\ntimes closer to the star (e.g. 1AU \u2013> 0.1AU) (Section \u00a73.1).\nAlso, using Kepler's Law, M\u2217 P2 = A3 , the Keplerian time\nwill be \u223c10 times smaller if the mass and radius are reduced\nby a factor of 10. This would lead to very rapid dust evolution around brown dwarfs. Thus due to the whole 10 and\n\n20\u03bcm tracing region lying close to the central source in a\nbrown dwarf disk, stronger signatures of crystallinity would\nbe observed.\n5.3\n\nDependence on X-ray emission strength\n\nFigure 10a compares the crystalline mass fractions with the\nX-ray luminosity for brown dwarfs and T Tauri stars in Taurus. For the two brown dwarfs 2M04414825 and CFHT-BDTau 9, the X-ray luminosities are from our new Chandra\nobservations computed in the 0.3-8 keV bands. For the rest\nof the sources, the luminosities are from Grosso et al. (2007)\nXMM-Newton observations in the 0.5-8 keV range. There\nis a \u223c10% systematic difference between Chandra and the\nXMM data (\u223c -0.1 in logLX ). The 10\u03bcm crystalline mass\nfractions for brown dwarfs show an inverse correlation with\nthe X-ray strength (Fig. 10a; top left panel). We find a correlation coefficient of -0.6 at a 90% confidence level, obtained\nfrom a straight line fit to the plotted points (excluding the\nupper limits). The dependence is more evident if we compare\nthe 'extreme' cases such as V410 X-ray 6 and 2M04414825,\nthat show weak crystallinity in the disk but are among the\nstronger X-ray emitters in the sample. No correlation, however, is observed for the 20\u03bcm crystalline fractions (correlation coefficient = -0.02 at a confidence level of 99.99%), and\nwe find similar mass fractions of 620% for a range in Xray luminosities. Among the T Tauri stars, both the 10 and\n20\u03bcm crystalline mass fractions show a nearly flat distribution, and there is no clear dependence observed on the X-ray\nluminosity. The correlation coefficients are -0.01 \u2013 -0.02, at a\nconfidence level of 99.99%. There are, however, five T Tauri\nsources that show weak X-ray strength (LX < 1030 ergs/s)\nbut high 20\u03bcm crystalline mass fractions of >30% (Fig. 10a;\nbottom right panel). Though these make up a small \u223c7%\nfraction of the T Tauri sample, there may be a possible inverse trend observed among the weaker X-ray emitters for\nT Tauri stars.\nFigure 10b compares the grain growth levels in the\ndisks with X-ray luminosities. For the case of the brown\ndwarfs, the 10\u03bcm fractions again show a dependence on\nthe X-ray strength; sources with stronger X-ray emission of\nLX >1029 ergs/s have higher grain growth levels of >40%. We\nfind a correlation coefficient of 0.42 at a 92% confidence level\nobtained from a straight line fit to the plotted points. The\ncorrelation is again more evident when comparing extreme\ncases such as 2M04414825 and MHO 5 with V410 Anon 13,\nthat either show very high or negligible fractions of large\ngrains in the disk. A weak anti-correlation may be present\nfor the 20\u03bcm large-grain fractions (correlation coefficient of\n-0.3 at 94% confidence level). However, the cold component\nlarge-grain fractions have higher uncertainties and we have\nfewer data points at 20\u03bcm, making it difficult to confirm any\npossible trend. Among the T Tauri stars, a large scatter in\nthe 10\u03bcm large-grain mass fractions between 0-80% is observed for a range in X-ray luminosities. There are three T\nTauri sources with strong X-ray emission (LX >1030 ergs/s)\nand comparatively higher 20\u03bcm large-grain mass fractions\nof >40%. But it is unlikely to confirm any X-ray dependence (correlation coefficients <0.05), considering that the\ncold component large-grain mass fraction is less than 5% for\nmore than 90% of the T Tauri sources.\nWe have two brown dwarfs in our sample, V410 X-ray\n\n\fThe radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks\n6 and 2M04141760, which have been classified as X-ray flaring sources (Grosso et al. 2007). V410 X-ray 6 is a stronger\nX-ray emitter, and shows variability in LX between 8E28\nand 6.3E29 ergs/s. 2M04141760 shows variability in LX between 1E28 and 8.5E28 ergs/s. In Fig. 10a (top left panel),\n2M04141760 is a clear outlier, and the inverse correlation\nbetween crystallinity and LX will be stronger if we ignore\nthis variable source. Similar is the case for the large-grain\nmass fractions (Fig. 10b; top left panel), where V410 X-ray\n6 is an outlier and ignoring this variable source increases the\ncorrelation coefficient between large-grain fractions and LX\nto 0.6.\nThere is thus evidence of a possible anti-correlation between the X-ray emission strength and the crystallinity in\nthe warm component of the disks. Sudden X-ray activity\nmay be responsible for varying the crystalline structure of\ndust grains in the disk surface layers. If X-ray amorphization happens quickly, then perhaps the maximum X-ray luminosity, as that observed for V410 X-ray 6, 2M04141760\nand 2M04414825, is what directly determines the inner disk\ncrystallinity, rather than some average X-ray luminosity. If\nwe only consider the rightmost points for these objects in the\nplot in question, then there is a pretty reasonable correlation in the upper left plots of Fig. 10a and b. Processes such\nas amorphization by ion irradiation have been discussed to\nexplain the absence of crystalline silicates in the ISM (e.g.,\nBringa et al. 2007; J\u00e4ger et al. 2003; Kemper et al. 2004).\nSome laboratory experiments have shown low-energy (keV)\nions to be efficient in amorphizing silicate dust (e.g., Demyk\net al. 2001; J\u00e4ger et al. 2003). However, the amophization\ntimescales estimated by some of these studies are quite long.\nIn the ISM, Kemper et al. (2004) suggest that the amorphization process occurs on a timescale much shorter than\nthe grain destruction timescale, and it would take \u223c9 Myr to\nachieve the low crystallinity level observed for the ISM dust\n(\u223c0.4%). Bringa et al. (2007) estimate a \u223c70 Myr timescale\nfor amorphization of ISM silicates by heavy-ion cosmic rays\nat GeV energies. In a study of variability in T Tauri disks,\nBary et al. (2009) found the 10\u03bcm spectra to vary over\nmonth- and year-long timescales, but shorter timescales on\nday- to week-long periods were not detected. On the other\nhand, for the young eruptive star EX Lupi, \u00c1brah\u00e1m et\nal. (2009) obtained a 10\u03bcm spectrum just 2 months after\nan eruption in 2008, and found significant variations when\ncompared with an earlier 2005 silicate spectrum. \u00c1brah\u00e1m\net al. have noted the fast removal of crystalline silicates to be\npossibly due to amorphization by X-rays. It is thus difficult\nto estimate the expected timescale for the crystalline structure to reform, or otherwise appear in the spectrum. Coronal\nX-ray emission may correlate with other high energetic radiation in effectively destroying the crystalline silicates, and\nthis may reduce the timescale over which such processes take\nplace.\nAn opposite trend is observed for the large dust grains\nin the warm disk regions for brown dwarfs. Ilgner & Nelson\n(2006) have considered X-ray irradiation from the central\nstar to be the main source of ionisation, and have studied\nthe vertical diffusion of chemical species, that mimics the\neffects of turbulent mixing in the disk. These authors have\nshown that X-ray ionisation induces turbulence that results\nin a decrease or a complete removal of the \"dead\" zones\nin the disk. Such zones are defined to be the regions that\n\n11\n\nare too neutral and decoupled from the disk magnetic field\nfor MHD turbulence to be maintained, as opposed to the\n\"active\" zones that are sufficiently ionised for the gas to be\nwell-coupled to the magnetic field, and thus able to maintain turbulence. M-type pre-main sequence stars should be\nfully convective, so they can have strong magnetic fields that\ncould give rise to X-rays. X-rays would therefore be suggestive of a strong stellar magnetic field. The stronger magnetic\nfield then drives a more vigorous Balbus-Hawley instability\n(Balbus & Hawley 1991) in the disk, which gives rise to turbulence in the disk. Increasing X-ray irradiation could thus\nbe an indirect indicator of the presence of a strong magnetic\nfield, which could result in active turbulent mixing in the\ndisk. With increasing turbulence, the level of sedimentation\nwould decrease and a higher fraction of large-grains would\nbe detected in the upper disk layers, as probed by the silicate\nemission features.\nThe outer disk crystalline and large-grain mass fractions\nhowever are unaffected, which suggests that X-rays cannot\npenetrate into the surface layers at larger radii in the disk.\nFor the case of T Tauri stars, no clear trend is observed for\nany of the two processes with the strength in X-ray emission.\nIn Fig. 10, there is a significant overlap in the X-ray luminosities (-1.4 < log(Lx) < -0.2) between the brown dwarf\nand T Tauri star samples. From the work of Reiners et al.\n(2009), the magnetic field strengths range between 2-3 kG\nfor M3-M6 stars. For later types objects at spectral type\nof M7-M9, the field strengths are 1-2 kG (Reiners & Basri\n2010). The field strengths for the T Tauri stars and substellar objects are found to be quite similar (\u223c2kG) at a\nyoung age of \u223c5Myr (Reiners et al. 2010). The similarity\nin the magnetic field strengths between T Tauri stars and\nbrown dwarfs implies that any possible correlation found\nfor the brown dwarfs mass fractions with X-ray luminosities\nmust also hold true for the T Tauri stars. The lack of any\ncorrelation for the T Tauri stars suggests that there may\nbe more decoupled zones in these disks, compared to the\nsub-stellar cases. Or, perhaps the amorphization process resulting in low crystallinity at high X-ray irradiation (or the\nopposite process for the grain growth) may occur too quickly\nor at a much shorter timescale in T Tauri disks. Such processes may proceed at a slower pace in brown dwarfs, making\nit possible to study them.\n5.4\n\nThe presence of crystalline silicates in the\ncold outer disk regions\n\nA fundamental finding of our work is the almost constant\ncrystallinity observed regardless of the disk radius being\nprobed. Crystalline silicates are certainly not less abundant\nin the outer cold regions of circum(sub)stellar disks. Two\nmain mechanisms are considered to dominate the crystalline\nformation: (1)- gas-phase condensation at high temperature above \u223c1200 K; (2)- thermal annealing at temperature\nabove \u223c800 K.\nIn the gas-phase condensation model, the pristine interstellar dust of olivine and pyroxene composition is transported inwards to the warm inner regions, where these grains\nare evaporated. The elements of Mg, Si, Fe and O liberated due to evaporation then recondense when the gas cools\ndown to form the forsterite and enstatite condensates. In\nthe model calculations of Gail (2004), the evaporation rate\n\n\f12\n\nRiaz et al.\n\nreaches a peak at a disk radius of \u223c0.6 AU, and the pristine\ndust mixture is completely evaporated within this radius.\nThe inner regions of <0.6 AU are mainly occupied by the\nequilibrated components of forsterite and enstatite, although\na small fraction of these silicates is also transported in the\nouter cold regions due to turbulent diffusion and large-scale\ncirculation that mixes the grains inwards and outwards. The\nabundance of crystalline forsterite and enstatite at 10 AU is\na factor of \u223c4 less than the abundance at 1 AU (Gail 2004).\nThis difference in abundances with disk radii could explain\nthe trend noted above of higher crystalline mass fraction for\nthe sub-stellar objects compared to the higher mass stars, as\nthe silicate feature probes smaller radii of 61 AU for brown\ndwarfs compared to 10-20 AU for T Tauri disks. Gail (2004)\nestimate a timescale of \u223c1 Myr for the transport, diffusion,\nannealing, evaporation and recondensation processes and to\neventually reach chemical equilibrium, which is consistent\nwith observations.\nFigure 11 compares the enstatite and forsterite mass\nfractions in the inner and outer disk regions for brown dwarf\nand T Tauri disks. The 10 and 20\u03bcm mass fractions for\nthese dust species in brown dwarfs show a similar range between 0 and \u223c30%. However, the brown dwarf 2M04230607\nis a prominent outlier, and shows a higher abundance of\nforsterite in the outer disk region. Among the T Tauri\ndisks, there are about 10% sources that show a similar high\nforsterite and enstatite fraction in the cold component of\nthe disk. We consider the case where these different kinds\nof crystals form through the gas-phase condensation mechanism (e.g., Gail 2004). At high temperatures, forsterite condensates are formed, along with silica (due to dissociation\nof silicate minerals). This is followed by enstatite formation at a slightly lower temperature due to gas-solid reactions between forsterite and silica. One explanation for the\nhigher forsterite fraction in the outer disk could be that the\nforsterite at larger radii is not converted to enstatite through\nsolid-gas reactions with silica. This could happen if the surrounding SiO2 gas is cooled rapidly or if the silica grains\ncoagulate, thus preventing the reactions. We could also consider non-equilibrium conditions in the inner disk, such that\nonly forsterite is formed, and then there is a rapid outward\ntransport of forsterite to prevent reactions with silica to form\nenstatite. Thereafter, equilibrium conditions may prevail in\nthe inner disk regions (e.g., Bouwman et al. 2008).\nSome cases of compositional differences among comets\nare also known. More specifically, a contrast has been noted\nbetween comets with Mg-rich crystals, e.g., Hale-Bopp,\nwhich comes from the Oort cloud and probably formed near\nJupiter in the giant planet region, and comets with Ferich crystals, such as, 9P/Tempel 1, which came from the\ntransneptunian region, i.e., further from the Sun (e.g., Lisse\net al. 2007; Keller & Gail 2004). This may be indicative of\nthe degree of hydration (or other conditions) in the nebular region where they formed, since Fe-rich silicates hydrate more easily than Mg-rich ones (e.g., Brownlee et al.\n2006). Alternatively, the Fe-rich crystals may have formed\nclose to the young Sun (within the present orbit of Mercury), since their annealing requires a high temperature of\n\u223c1400 K (e.g., Nuth & Johnson 2006), and then transported\noutwards to the comet formation zone. The transport, however, must have occurred early on, some 5 to 10 Myr after\nnebula formation, after which the formation of giant planet\n\ncores would have inhibited further radial transport across\ntheir orbits (Lisse et al. 2006). Thus these objects may have\nformed at different times, as the properties of the dust in\nthe outer nebula evolved from the pre-solar nebula properties (e.g., Lisse et al. 2006; Ciesla 2009). A difference in the\nlocation or the times of formation could explain the compositional differences observed for 2M04230607. There may\nhave been a rapid outward transport of crystalline forsterite\nto prevent reactions with the surrounding silica to form enstatite, resulting in a low enstatite fraction in the outer disk,\nor forsterite may have formed later in the outer disk due\nto some in-situ formation mechanism, resulting in a high\nforsterite fraction in the cold component.\nThere may be some local crystalline formation mechanism occurring in the cold component, such as lowtemperature crystallization due to physical or chemical processes that could temporarily raise the local temperature\nin a turbulent disk environment and cause crystallization,\nfollowed by slow cooling over a few seconds timescale (e.g.,\nMolster et al. 1999). A plausible mechanism could be flash\nheating of dust by shock waves, which has been proposed\nas a formation mechanism for chondrules found in meteorites (e.g., Harker & Desch 2002). Tanaka et al. (2010)\nhave recently formulated a model in which low-temperature\ncrystallization can be induced by the latent heat of chemical reaction with the ambient gas, and may be triggered\nat temperatures of a few hundred kelvin and at the low\ngas densities typically observed in the outer regions of a\nprotoplanetary disk. Such non-thermal crystallization could\nproceed if the heat of reaction is of the order of 1026 K\ncm\u22123 , and the heat is transferred to the grains on a short\ntimescale of a millisecond or less. Tanaka et al. have argued\nthat this amount of stored energy density is less than that\nrequired for chondrule formation, and could be triggered by\ncertain mechanisms likely common in protoplanetary disks\nsuch as grain-grain collisions or heating by shock waves due\nto gravitational instabilities. Interestingly, they find that a\nhigher stored energy density is required to crystallize amorphous silicate of enstatite composition than forsterite composition, suggesting a higher abundance of enstatite in the\nwarm inner region. Their model could provide an alternative\nto large-scale radial mixing for cases such as 2M04230607,\nthat show a higher fraction of forsterite in the cold component. If both forms of crystalline silicates are formed in\nthe hot inner disk and then transported outwards, similar\nabundances should be expected throughout the entire disk.\nA gradient in the dust chemical composition suggests some\nlocal crystalline formation mechanism, which could be lowtemperature crystallization.\nAlternatively, amorphous dust can be thermally annealed into crystalline dust at temperatures above \u223c1000\nK (e.g., Nuth & Johnson 2006), followed by an efficient\nradial mixing mechanism to transport crystalline material\nfrom the hot inner disk to the cold outer parts (e.g., Nuth\net al. 2000; Keller & Gail 2004; Okamoto et al. 2004). The\nvery first detection of crystalline silicates in comets, or in\nany celestial source (except meteorites), was reported by\nCampins & Ryan (1989). Since then, several comets have\nbeen noted to have a high abundance of crystalline dust, for\ne.g., Hale-Bopp has a silicate composition which is \u223c67%\ncrystalline, while the transneptunian comet Temple 1 has an\neven higher \u223c80% crystalline mass fraction (e.g., Lisse et al.\n\n\fThe radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks\n2007). Since these comets are formed in regions much colder\nthan the annealing temperatures in excess of 1000 K, several\nmechanisms have been proposed to explain the transport of\nhigh-temperature silicates from the inner regions of the solar nebula to the cold outer regions where comets formed.\nIt is interesting to discuss the possible analogies between\ncomets and brown dwarf disks, in terms of the presence of\nhigh-temperature material in the cold outer regions, and the\nmechanisms responsible for their outward transport. Ciesla\n(2009) has considered the \"jet model\" to explain the high\nabundance of crystalline grains in comet Wild 2 collected by\nthe Stardust spacecraft. Their jet model is similar to the Xwind model from Shu et al. (1996). The X-wind model was\nproposed to launch \"proto-chondrules\" as projectiles from\nthe \"X-region\" close to the star. These proto-chondrules\nwould be heated to various degrees close to the young Sun\nand then launched in ballistic trajectories above the disk as\na result of winds driven through the interaction of the magnetic field of the Sun with the inner edge of the solar nebula.\nThe proto-chondrules would land back in the outer regions\nof the disk, which would ordinarily be too cold to melt and\ncrystallize the chondrules.\nIn the Ciesla (2009) model, jets launched from the inner solar nebula deliver high-temperature materials to the\nouter comet formation region. The dust grains are injected\ninto the upper disk layers and then vertically diffuse to\nthe disk midplane. The abundance of crystalline grains in\na comet would be dependent on the delivery timescale to\nthe outer nebula, or the rate of injection. If the delivery of\nthe high-temperature grains occurs over a short timescale\n(6104 years), i.e., shorter than the timescale for radial redistribution, then the crystalline grains can mix with the\nnative amorphous grains, and high crystalline fractions can\nbe achieved in the comets or cometesimals thus formed. If\nthe delivery occurs over a longer timescale (105 -106 years),\nthen cometesimal growth would have begun in an environment where high-temperature grains were absent, leading to formation of comets with low abundance of hightemperature silicate grains from the inner solar nebula. Such\ncometesimals could have an outer layer of high-temperature\ngrains that slowly settled to the midplane. Thus if the delivery/injection to the outer cold regions occurs over a short\ntimescale, then a homogenous mixture would result, while\nslower delivery would form a heterogenous comet (Ciesla\n2009).\nThe brown dwarf disks we have studied in this work are\nat young ages of \u223c1 Myr. The high crystalline abundance\nfound in the outer cold regions of 2M04230607 or CFHTBD-Tau 20 suggests delivery of high-temperature crystalline\nsilicates to the cold regions at an early stage of <104 years.\nBoth of these disks also show a \u223c20-40% fraction of large\namorphous grains, indicating a homogenous composition\nwhich can be expected in the case of early mixing. None\nof these two sources, however, are known to drive outflows,\nand so the jet model may not be an applicable mechanism.\nNearly a dozen brown dwarf outflow sources have been discovered to date (e.g., Whelan et al. 2009). Two of these outflow sources are found to be rich in crystalline silicates in\nthe inner disk regions (e.g., Phan-Bao et al. 2008; R09), but\nthe outer disk silicate spectrum is either flat or shows amorphous features. Typical outflow mass loss rates for brown\ndwarfs are between 10\u221210 and 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (e.g., Whe-\n\n13\n\nlan et al. 2009). Perhaps the outflow emission strengths are\ntoo weak to efficiently transport high-temperature material\nto the cold regions. A detailed study of silicate features for\nthe outflow sources will be valuable in determining how effective outflows can be in the radial transport of crystalline\nsilicates.\nMore than one mechanism may be responsible for\nthe transport of high-temperature silicates. An alternative\nscenario has recently been presented by Vinkovi\u0107 (2009),\nwherein a non-radial radiation pressure force could loft a\ncrystalline grain several scale heights above the disk midplane in the warm inner regions, followed by gliding over\nthe disk surface towards colder disk regions. The grain then\nre-enters and settles towards lower scale heights when the\npeak wavelength is larger than the grain size and the radiation force keeping the dust afloat ceases. In the Vinkovic\n(2009) model, dust particles of sizes 6 1mm in optically thick\nprotoplanetary disks are well coupled with the gas. The dynamics of the dust particles are dominated by the gas drag,\nand dust motion is very similar to the gas orbital, which is almost Keplerian motion. The radiation pressure force serves\nas the slow perturbation that leads to the rearrangement\nof dust orbits. The net radiation pressure force is directed\nexactly parallel to the disk surface irrespective of its curvature. The large grains are thus able to migrate along any\ndisk curvature. Such surface flows might be possible, however, Vinkovi\u0107 model assumes a laminar disk without turbulence. It is not clear if such a gliding process or radiationpressure mixing is indeed more effective than other process\nsuch as turbulent diffusion, X-winds, or other mechanisms\nthat could transport crystalline material to the outer region.\nNevertheless, the high crystallinity level found in the outer\nregions for a few of these \u223c1 Myr old brown dwarf disks indicates rapid outward transport as well as vertical diffusion\nduring the early stages of formation of these disks.\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe present a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20\u03bcm silicate emission features for brown dwarf disks in the TaurusAuriga star-forming region. The spectra show a variety in\nthe emission features characteristic of silicate grains, both\namorphous and crystalline in composition. A comparison of\nthe crystalline and large-grain mass fractions in the warm\nand cold components of the disk, as well as with the higher\nmass T Tauri stars in Taurus, indicates the following:\n(i) Brown dwarfs show stronger signs of dust processing\nin the cold component compared to T Tauri stars. The grain\ngrowth and crystallinity levels in the cold disk regions for\nlater type stars are a factor of \u223c2-3 higher compared to\nthe warm component, while the fraction of small amorphous\ngrains is smaller by a factor of \u223c4.\n(ii) The brown dwarf 2M04230607 provides an interesting\ncase where a difference in the crystalline silicate composition\nis observed in the inner and outer disk regions; the forsterite\nmass fraction in the outer disk is a factor of \u223c3 higher than\nthe inner disk fraction. Simple large-scale radial mixing cannot account for the gradient in the dust chemical composition and some local crystalline formation mechanism may\nbe effective in this disk.\n\n\f14\n\nRiaz et al.\n\n(iii) We have four 'outlier' cases among the brown dwarfs\nthat show strong 10\u03bcm features but very weak 20\u03bcm features, implying significant grain growth/dust settling has\noccurred at larger radii in these disks. Another outlier case\nis of CFHT-BD-Tau 20 that shows a weak 10\u03bcm feature but\nstrong emission at 20\u03bcm. Such outliers suggest that dust\nprocessing mechanisms may not proceed simultaneously in\nthe inner and outer regions for all brown dwarf disks.\n(iv) Chandra X-ray observations have been presented for\ntwo Taurus brown dwarfs 2M04414825 and CFHT-BD-Tau\n9. These observations were obtained to probe any dependence of crystallization on X-ray emission strength. We find\n2M04414825, which has a \u223c12% crystalline fraction, to be an\norder of magnitude brighter in X-ray than CFHT-BD-Tau\n9, which has a \u223c35% crystalline mass fraction. Combining\nwith previously published X-ray data for brown dwarfs in\nTaurus, we find the inner disk crystalline mass fraction to\nbe anti-correlated with the X-ray emission strength.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSupport for this work was provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through Chandra Award\nNumber 12200172 issued by the Chandra X-ray Observatory\nCenter, which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical\nObservatory for and on behalf of the National Aeronautics\nSpace Administration under contract NAS8-03060.
