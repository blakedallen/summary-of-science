For example, using\nthe mixing-fallback model proposed by Umeda &\nNomoto (2002) (hereafter UN02) and Umeda &\nNomoto (2003) (hereafter UN03) mimicking aspherical explosion effects (e.g., Tominaga 2009),\nthey showed that the abundance patterns of the elements from C to Zn of carbon-normal EMP stars\nand carbon-rich EMP stars can be successfully reproduced by energetic core-collapse SN (\"hypernova\", hereafter HN), models and faint SN models, respectively (UN02; UN05; Tominaga et al.\n2007), while those of very metal poor (VMP) stars\n<\n(\u22123 <\n\u223c [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122) can be reproduced by normal\ncore-collapse SN models or the IMF-integration\nof hypernova and normal core-collapse SN models (Tominaga et al. 2007). It is important to\nnote that the observed EMP stars are so far all\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe abundance patterns of extremely metalpoor (EMP) stars are useful in studying nucleosynthesis in massive supernovae (SNe). Population (Pop) III stars are usually considered to be\nmassive stars. Some of them might become black\nholes without supernova explosions, but some\nshould have exploded as supernovae to initiate\nthe first metal enrichment in the early universe.\nThe stars born from the gas enriched by the Pop\nIII SNe are Pop II stars with low metallicity. Lowmass Pop II stars have long lifetimes and might\nbe observed as extremely metal poor (EMP) stars\nwith [Fe/H] <\n\u223c \u22123. (Here, [A/B] = log10 (NA /NB )\n- log10 (NA /NB )\u2299 , where the subscript \"\u2299\" refers\nthe solar value and NA and NB are the abundances\nof elements A and B, respectively.) Therefore, a\nEMP star may reflect the nucleosynthetic result\nof a Pop III SN and constrain properties of the\n\n1\n\n\fments may be synthesized for low Ye (<0.47). Although the production of weak r-process elements\nin neutrino-driven winds was suggested, it is difficult to give a detailed yield because the physical\nconditions and ejected mass depend on unknown\nsupernova explosion mechanisms.\nExplosive nucleosynthesis in low Ye matter was\nalso studied in the context of multi-dimensional\nexplosion models (Janka et al. 2003; Pruet et al.\n2003). They showed that small amounts of low Ye\n(<\n\u223c0.46) matter as well as high Ye (<\n\u223c0.56) matter\nare ejected from a hot bubble just outside a protoneutron star. The high Ye (<\n\u223c0.56) matter is suggested to be ejected even in the one-dimensional\ncases (e.g., Fr\u00f6lich et al. 2006). On the other\nhand, the ejection of low Ye matter is driven by the\nconvection in the hot bubble, and thus essentially\nthe multi-dimensional phenomenon. Janka et al.\n(2003) suggested that the low Ye matter contains\nthe weak r-process elements (Sr, Y and Zr) to explain the Galactic abundances, but a detailed nucleosynthesis calculation did not confirm the production of these elements (Pruet et al. 2005).\nIn this paper, we investigate the physical conditions to produce sufficient amounts of the weak\nr-process elements (Sr, Y and Zr) and discuss\nwhether core-collapse SNe with a slight modification can be compatible with the observed abundances of the weak r-process elements in the EMP\nstars. In order to do this, we assume that small\namount of low Ye matter is ejected by the multidimensional effects, which may be driven by the\nconvection in a hot bubble (Janka et al. 2003) or\njets in a jet-like explosion (e.g., Maeda & Nomoto\n2003) or a collapsar model (e.g., Pruet et al. 2003,\n2004; Popham, Woosley & Fryer 1999). The entropy of the low Ye matter flow may depend on the\nejection mechanism. We assume that the matter\nflow has the same entropy as the supernova shock\nwave. Jet-like explosion or collapsar models may\ndescribe HNe. However, they contain many unknown parameters, and the innermost Ye of the\nejecta depends on those parameters. On the other\nhand, the simulations of Janka et al. (2003) contain less input parameters, so the obtained Ye profile is more reliable, though their simulations are\nabout normal SNe. We are interested in the EMP\nstars, and their progenitor may be more massive\nand explode energetically, i.e., may become HNe.\nTherefore, we vary Ye beyond the range given by\n\nexplained by the pollutions by core-collapse SNe\nwith initial stellar masses 11M\u2299 <\n\u223cM <\n\u223c 130M\u2299\nand no evidence of pair instability SNe1 with initial stellar masses 140M\u2299 <\n\u223cM <\n\u223c 300M\u2299 (UN02,\nsee also Chieffi & Limongi 2002; UN03; Umeda &\nNomoto 2005, hereafter UN05; Heger & Woosley\n2002, 2008).\nThese previous SN models do not eject elements\nheavier than Zn in a sizeable amount, and this\nis consistent with the abundance of some EMP\nstars. However, there are also EMP stars showing\nenhancements of neutron-capture elements. Some\nof them show abundance patterns almost identical to the solar system r-process pattern for Sr\nand heavier elements (e.g., Sneden et al. 2000;\nHill et al. 2002). One example of such a star\nis CS22892-052 and called as a main \"r-process\nstar\" (Sneden et al. 2003). The process producing heavy neutron capture elements (\u223cBa-U) is\nreferred to as \"main\" r-process (e.g., Truran et al.\n2002; Wanajo & Ishimaru 2006). On the other\nhand, there are other EMP stars that require another neutron-capture process referred sometimes\nas \"LEPP\" (lighter element primary process) or\n\"weak r-process\" (Travaglio et al. 2004; Wanajo\n& Ishimaru 2006). Travaglio et al. (2004) reported EMP stars with abundances of Sr, Y, and\nZr which cannot be explained by the s-process\nor main r-process. In the weak r-process stars,\nthe elements with intermediate mass (37\u2264Z\u226447,\ni.e., from Rb to Ag) elements show moderate enhancements with respect to heavy ones (Z\u226556, i.e.,\nheavier than Ba). More recently Franco\u0327is et al.\n(2007) showed several other examples of the weak\nr-process stars. There are evidences of the existence of weak r-process but its origin is unknown.\nSeveral possible mechanisms to produce the\nweak r-process elements are proposed. Wanajo\net al. (2001) presented calculations of r-process\nnucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven winds from a\nproto-neutron stars. They showed that the abundance pattern of weak r-process is reproduced\nwhen the main r-process nucleosynthesis is failed.\nThe nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven winds was\nalso studied in Hoffman et al. (1996) by taking the\nelectron fraction Ye of the wind matter as a free\nparameter. They showed that weak r-process ele1 Pair\n\ninstability SNe explode by the explosive oxygen burning, before the onset of Fe core-collapse.\n\n2\n\n\fthe simulation in Janka et al. (2003). Although\nwe have multi-dimensional effects in mind, we only\nperform one-dimensional calculations in this paper, because it is often useful to make a large parametric search to disclose the essence of physics.\nIn \u00a7 2, we show observational trends of [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe].\nIn \u00a7 3, we describe our progenitor and explosion\nmodels. In \u00a7 4, we present weak r-process nucleosynthesis and specify conditions mention our assumption applying to our models in order to reproduce reproducing the observational [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe].\nWe also compare our yields with 4 EMP stars\nwhich have peculiarly high [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe]. In \u00a7 5,\nsummaries and discussions are given.\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL DATA\n\n3.1.\n\nSince we are interested in the weak r-process\nelements in the EMP stars, we select stars with\n[Fe/H] <\n\u223c \u22122.8 from Cayrel et al. (2004) and use\ntheir data from carbon to zinc. Observations of\n[Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] are taken from Honda et al. (2006)\nfor HD122563 and Franco\u0327is et al. (2007) for the\nother stars.\nTaking the previous works on the weak rprocess into consideration, we use two abundance\nratios as a diagnostic to distinguish \"main rprocess stars\" and \"weak r-process stars\". They\nare relative numbers of Sr and Ba, Sr/Ba, and\nY and Eu, Y/Eu. We use log(N/NH )\u2299 from Anders & Grevesse (1989). A main r-process star\nCS22892-052 has [Sr/Ba] = -0.57 and [Y/Eu]\n= -1.16. Therefore, if a EMP star has [Sr/Ba]\n> \u22120.57 and [Y/Eu] > \u22121.16, we consider the\nstar as a weak r-process star, otherwise as a main\nr-process star (see also Aoki et al. 2005). Figure\n1 shows [Sr/Fe], [Y/Fe], and [Zr/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] of\nthe weak r-process stars. Among 21 selected stars,\n20 stars are with \u22121 <\n\u223c [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] <\n\u223c 1.\n3.\n\nE51 = 20 (hereafter model-2520). Model-1301 and\nmodel-2501 are normal SN models, and model2520 is a HN model. Detailed nucleosynthesis is\ncalculated as a postprocessing after the hydrodynamical calculation with a simple \u03b1-network. The\nisotopes included in the post process calculations\nare 809 species up to 121 Pd (see Table 1). We note\nthat a neutrino process during explosive burning\n(Yoshida et al. 2008; Woosley & Weaver 1995)\nis not taken into account. The abundance distributions after the SN explosion for model-1301,\nmodel-2501 and model-2520 are shown in Figure\n2. We obtain the final yields by setting the inner\nboundary of the ejected matter, a mass-cut (Mcut )\nas we describe in the next section.\nMASS-CUT\n\nIn this section we summarize the abundance\npattern of SN ejecta when a \"conventional\" masscut is adopted. The \"conventional\" means that\nthe mass-cut is chosen to eject a reasonable\namount of 56 Ni. Although previously the mass-cut\nis often chosen to eject 0.07 M\u2299 of 56 Ni reproducing the brightness of normal SNe as SN1987A (e.g.,\nNomoto et al. 2003b), we set Mcut = 1.59 M\u2299 for\nmodel-1301, 1.76 M\u2299 for model-2501 and 2.31\nM\u2299 for model-2520 to yield [Si/Fe] \u2243 [Si/56 Ni]\n\u223c 0.4. As a result, 13M\u2299 model eject a similar\namount of 56 Ni to SN 1987A (\u223c 0.07 M\u2299 ), but\n25M\u2299 models eject large amounts of 56 Ni (\u223c 0.5\nM\u2299 )2 . In Figure 3, the abundance patterns from\nSi to Ru are compared with those of EMP stars.\nThis figure shows that the adopted Mcut s yield\na rather good agreement between the predicted\nand the observed abundance ratios for most of the\nelements above Si. On the contrary, [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe]\nin the models are much lower than those observed\nin the \"weak r-process stars\".\n4.\n\nMETHOD & MODEL\n\nThe calculation method and other assumptions\nare the same as described in Umeda et al. 2000\n(hereafter UNN00), UN02, UN05 and Tominaga et\nal. 2007, except for the size of the nuclear reaction\nnetworks. In this paper, we adopt the Pop III progenitors as in UN05 and apply the model with M\n= 13 M\u2299 and E51 = 1.5 (hereafter model-1301),\nthe one with M = 25 M\u2299 and E51 = 1 (hereafter\nmodel-2501), and the one with M = 25 M\u2299 and\n\nWEAK r-PROCESS\nTHESIS\n\nNUCLEOSYN-\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a7 3, the models with the\n\"conventional\" mass-cut do not reproduce \u22121 <\n\u223c\n[Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] \u223c 1. In this section, we study the\nconditions to produce weak r-process elements.\nWe take into account of the uncertainty of Ye and\n2 In\n\nthe models assuming the mixing-fallback effects, the actual amount of the ejected 56 Ni mass is smaller than this\nvalue. See e.g., Table 3 and section 4.4 below.\n\n3\n\n\fassume some ejection of matter from regions below\nMcut .\n4.1.\n\ngion of supernovae to estimate the total yield when\nthe same amount of matter below the conventional\nmass cut, with Ye arbitrarily changed with respect\nto the presupernova value, is ejected.\nIn order to perform nucleosynthesis calculations, we need histories of temperature and density for a given mass element. Strictly speaking,\nthe histories depend on explosion models and how\nthe matter is carried outside and cannot be represented by a one-dimensional model. To avoid complication, however, we carry out the same calculations with Section 3 but in the region below Mcut\nand arbitrarily changing the Ye in the progenitor\nmodel according to Figure 4. This approach helps\nsimplifying the complicated problems and clarifying the essence of physics. With this assumption,\nthe entropy of the low Ye flow is s/kb \u223c3 for SNe\nand \u223c15 for HNe, which is similar value as the\nmatter just above Mcut .\nIt has been long discussed that if a normal SN\nproduces main r-process elements. This is because\nthe SN has to eject quite high-entropy neutrino\ndriven wind. As for the weak r-process, Wanajo\net al. (2001), for example, showed that if the\nentropy of the neutrino driven wind is not high\nenough for the main r-process, a weak r-processlike pattern is obtained. However, whether a SN\ncan eject such kind of mater is unpredictable because explosion simulations have not been succeeded. Therefore, we consider an extreme case\nthat no neutrino-driven high-entropy matter but\nthe supernova-shocked matter is ejected. The ejection of high entropy matter are discussed in the\nlast part of Section 5 briefly and will be discussed\nin detail elsewhere.\n\nYe Uncertainty and Mass Ejection\nfrom the Region below Mcut\n\nRecent theoretical multi-D hydrodynamical\nsimulations of core collapse supernova have shown\nthat the presupernova value of Ye can be modified during the explosion, even significantly, in\nthe innermost zones of the exploding envelope. In\nFigure 4 we schematically depict the value of Ye\nbefore and after the explosion. The presupernova\nvalue shown is for the model when the central\ndensity is \u223c 1010 g cm\u22123 . After that time, the\nelectron capture significantly reduces Ye (<\n\u223c0.4) in\nthe inner part, but the very neutron-rich matter\nis rarely ejected.\nRecent simulations have shown that not only\nneutron-rich(Ye < 0.5) but also proton-rich(Ye >\n0.5) regions appear after explosion(e.g., Fr\u00f6lich et\nal. 2006). The Ye distributions based on an actual\n2D-simulations is, for example, given in Figure 4 of\nPruet et al. (2006). Figure 4 shows the assumed\nYe profile mimicking the results of such simulations. Those simulations have shown that a density just above a proto-neutron star surface rapidly\ndecreases after the supernova shockwave passes\nthrough a Fe-core. This region is often called\na hot bubble, in which Ye is set by a competition between different lepton capture processes on\nfree nucleons. At the beginning of the explosion,\nan excess of electron neutrinos over antineutrinos\nmakes the matter tend to be proton-rich (Qian\nand Woosley 1996). Recent detailed one- and twodimensional simulations have shown that some of\nthese proton-rich matter is actually ejected. In\nthe later stages, the fluxes and spectral change of\nneutrinos make Ye less than 0.5. 2D simulations\nby Janka et al. (2003) have shown that not only\nthe proton-rich matter but also some neutron-rich\nmatter (Ye >\n\u223c0.46-0.47) is ejected. This is because\nthe hot bubble is convective and some of the inner\nmatter can be dragged outside.\nAlthough these previous calculations are for less\nmassive normal supernovae, the similar mechanism may work for more massive supernova. Even\nif the explosion mechanism is completely different,\nthe inner matter may be carried outside along the\njets in a jet-like explosions. Therefore, in the following we calculate nucleosynthesis in a deep re-\n\n4.2.\n\nParameter Dependences of \"Complete Si-Burning\"\n\nIn this subsection, we show parameter dependences of the products of the complete-Si burning. The complete Si-burning takes place in the\nshocked matter attaining the maximum temperature of log10 Tmax >9.5 and thus no unburned Si\nis left after the complete Si-burning. Since we are\nmainly interested in the ejection of low Ye matter from the beneath of a conventional mass-cut,\nMcut , we change Ye in the region from 0.40 to 0.50.\nAlthough Janka et al. (2003) showed the small\namount of ejection of matter with Ye \u223c0.56-0.46\nfrom the hot bubble region, we consider Ye as low\n4\n\n\fas 0.40 because the explosion mechanism is quite\nuncertain especially for hypernovae. In this paper\nwe do not consider Ye >0.5 matter. Its effect is\nbriefly discussed in Section 5.\nWe use the temperature and density trajectories of the models 1301, 2501 and 2520 as \u00a73. The\ndifference from \u00a73 is that we consider the deep\nregion below Mcut . We denote the mass coordinate of the inner and outer boundaries of the\nregion by M1 and M2 , respectively, and take mass\naverage in the region. M2 is defined by the location where X(28 Si)\u223c10\u22123 . M1 is chosen at a point\nnear Fe core surface. We note that the result is not\nsensitive to M1 because density and temperature\ntrajectories during nucleosynthesis is almost the\nsame around M1 . The specific values taken are\n(M1 ,M2 )=(1.41M\u2299,1.64M\u2299),(1.52M\u2299 ,1.92M\u2299 )\nand (1.61M\u2299 ,2.69M\u2299) for model-1301, model2501, and model-2520, respectively. Figure 5 illustrates the Ye profile for the three models we have\nassumed.\nNucleosynthesis of this region basically proceeds as \u03b1-rich freezeout. When the shock wave\nreaches the region, temperature rises rapidly and\nheavy elements are decomposed mainly into \u03b1particles. As the star expands and the temperature drops, \u03b1-rich freezeout takes place with\nroughly constant Ye . The mass fraction of \u03b1 at\nthe maximum temperature and later stages depends on the entropy, i.e., temperature and density. More \u03b1 is produced and heavier elements\nare synthesized for higher entropy explosions (e.g.,\nUN02).\n4.2.1.\n\nFe. We provide some explanations of the result\npaying attention to the abundance of X in the following paragraphs.\nAbsolute amounts of the synthesized weak rprocess elements are easily seen in Figure 9, which\nshows the mass fractions of Sr, Y and Zr in the\nregion. This figure shows that the abundances of\nthese elements are relatively large for Ye <\n\u223c0.48 and\nhave a peak around Ye \u223c0.43-0.46. For Ye \u223c0.420.43, most abundant isotopes that become Sr, Y\nand Zr are 88 Kr, and 89 Kr and 90 Kr, respectively.\nFor Ye \u223c0.45-0.46, these are 88 Sr, 89 Y and 90 Zr,\nrespectively. Since these isotopes are all neutronrich having Ye \u2261Z/A\u223c0.41-0.45, the weak r-process\nelements are tend to be produced most efficiently\nfor this range of Ye . We note that the exact processes complicatedly depend on entropy, Ye , the\nproperties of nuclear states, and the mass fraction\nof \u03b1 particles during \u03b1-rich freezeout.\nThe abundance peaks seem to locate at Ye \u223c0.43\nfor the normal energy models (1301 and 2501), and\nYe \u223c0.45-0.46 for model-2520. It is interesting that\nthe peak is located at a larger value of Ye for the\nhigher energy model. The reason for this is not\nsimple because the yields depend on the complicated properties of nuclear structures. For example, in the Ye =0.40 case in Figure 8 (model-2520),\nthe synthesized amounts of the weak r-process elements are small, but lighter elements, Ge to Kr,\nare quite abundant. For this specific case 82 Ge,\nwith Ye \u2261Z/A=0.390, is quite abundant after the\nexplosive synthesis. This decays into 82 Se and the\nsynthesis of heavier weak r-process elements are\nsuppressed.\n\nYe Dependence\n4.2.2.\n\nIn Figures 6-8, abundance ratios, [X/Fe], of the\ncomplete Si-burning products integrated over M1\nand M2 are shown. The abundance ratios of heavy\nelements as a function of Ye show non-monotonic\nbehavior in Figure 6-8. This behavior depends not\nonly on the abundance of X, but also on that of\nFe. For example, in Figure 6 and 7, Fe to heavy\nelements ratios, such as Sr/Fe, appear to be minimum for Ye \u223c0.45. This is because for Ye \u223c0.45\nthe most abundant isotope which becomes Fe is\n56\nFe and not 56 Ni. 56 Fe is produced relatively a\nlot for Ye \u223c0.45. Therefore, the reason for this\nnon-monotonic behavior is not simple. These figures also show that for Ye >\n\u223c 0.49, elements heavier\nthan Zn are not efficiently produced compared to\n\nM Dependence\n\nSince the density and temperature trajectories\nof the complete Si-burning region are not so different for model-1301 and model-2501, the abundance of weak r-process elements in model-1301\nand model-2501 are similar (Figure 6, 7 and 9).\n4.2.3.\n\nE Dependence\n\nAs seen in Figure 7, 8 and 9, high E enhances\nthe weak r-elements especially from Ye = 0.45 to\n0.47. Temperature of the complete Si-burning region in model-2520 is much higher than that in\nthe model-2501. Therefore, an entropy of model2520 is much higher than that of model-2501, and\n\n5\n\n\fmuch more \u03b1-particles can be obtained in model2520 than in model-2501. This is why more Sr, Y\nand Zr are produced in model-2520 than in model2501.\nThe abundances of Sr, Y and Zr are almost same in model-2501 and model-2520 when\nYe =0.49 and 0.50. When Ye is 0.49 and 0.50,\nthe elements produced also have Ye \u22430.5. Since\nheavy nucleus with Ye \u22430.5 are less bound than\nthose with neutron-rich (Hoffman et al. 1996),\nwhen Ye \u2243 0.5, heavier elements than Zn are not\nproduced even though E is high.\n4.3.\n\nmodels (a), \u2206M is set to obtain [Zn/Fe]\u22430.5 for\nmin >\nYemin <\n\u223c0.47 (model-2520), the\n\u223c0.46. For Ye\nsame value of \u2206M with the Yemin <\n\u223c0.46 models is\nadopted because [Zn/Fe] is lower than 0.5 even if\nall the matter below Mcut is ejected. For the models (b) and (c), \u2206M of the model (a) is divided by\n3 and 10, respectively.\nAs shown in Figure 10 and 11, [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] are\nnot improved to fit the observation in model-1301\nand model-2501. On the contrary, [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe]\nin model-2520 are high enough to be ranged in\n\u22121 < [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] < 1 when Yemin is from 0.45 to\n0.46 (Fig. 11). Note that the abundance patterns\nof [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] are different depending on Yemin .\nWhen Yemin =0.45, those ratios have the relation\nof [Sr/Fe]\u223c[Zr/Fe]>[Y/Fe]. When Yemin =0.452,\n[Sr/Fe] \u2243 [Y/Fe] < [Zr/Fe]. When Yemin = 0.454\u2212\n0.46, [Sr/Fe] < [Y/Fe] < [Zr/Fe].\n\nAbundance Patterns of Whole Ejecta\nwith Mass Ejection below Mcut\n\nNucleosynthesis pattern in the complete Siburning region with constant Ye is shown in the\nprevious subsection. In this subsection, assuming\nvarious Ye distributions in region below Mcut , we\npresent abundance patterns of whole ejecta with\nmass ejection below Mcut . For the matter below\nMcut , the yields are averaged for the Ye values\nranged from Yemin to Yemax . For example, the Ye\ndistribution Ye = 0.45-0.50 means that the yields\nare the average of the six models with Ye = 0.45,\n0.46, 0.47, 0.48, 0.49 and 0.50. In this subsection\nagain we do not consider the matter with Ye >0.5.\nThe main parameters of our models are \u2206M\nand Yemin . \u2206M is the mass of the ejected matter\nfrom the region below Mcut , and Yemin is the lowest\nYe of the ejected matter. \u2206M of the matter below\nMcut is added to the matter above Mcut, and they\nare assumed to be ejected to the outer space all\ntogether. Small amounts of matter with low Ye\ncould be ejected in two-dimensional or jet-like explosion models (e.g., Janka et al. 2003). As shown\nin the previous subsection, large amounts of Sr, Y\nand Zr are obtained when Ye = 0.43 in model-1301\nand model-2501, and when Ye = 0.45 in model2520. Therefore, we take Yemax = 0.5, and Yemin\n= 0.42 and 0.43 for model-1301 and model-2501,\nand various values from Yemin = 0.45 to 0.49 for\nmodel-2520. Here, \u2206M is selected to obtain 0 <\n\u223c\n[Zn/Fe] <\n\u223c 0.5.\nThe abundance patterns of the ejected matter for model-1301, model-2501 and model-2520\nare shown in Figure 10, 11 and 12-13, respectively. Yemin and \u2206M and some related numbers\nfor models (a) are summarized in Table 2. In the\n\n4.4.\n\nComparisons with Individual EMP\nStar\n\nIn this subsection we compare our yields of\nmodel-2520 with abundance patterns of EMP\nstars. Among the 22 weak r-process stars mentioned in \u00a7 1, 15 stars have [Sr/Ba]> 1 and\n[Y/Eu] > 1. We select Sr-rich stars with [Sr/Ba]\n> 1, [Y/Eu] > 1 and [Sr/Fe] > 0: BS16477003 ([Fe/H]=-3.36), CS22873-166 ([Fe/H]=-2.97)\n, CS22897-008 ([Fe/H]=-3.41) and CS29518-051\n([Fe/H]=-2.78). The observational data from He\nto Zn and beyond Zn are taken from Cayrel et al.\n(2004) and Franco\u0327is et al. (2007), respectively. Ye\ndistribution and \u2206M have been chosen in order\nto obtain the best fit to the observed abundances\nof Sr, Y and Zr. In order to adjust light to heavy\nelement ratios, such as O/Fe, we also assume the\nfollowing mixing-fallback process to take place in\nHN model-2520 (see e.g., Tominaga et al. 2007 for\ndetail):\n1. Burned material below Mmix (out) is uniformly\nmixed.\n2. Afterward only a fraction (f ) of the mixed material is ejected with the matter above Mmix(out).\nWe set Mmix (out) = 3.60M\u2299 for the C-poor\nstars with [C/Mg]<0, such as CS22873-166 and\nCS29518-051, and 5.76M\u2299 for C-normal stars with\n[C/Mg]\u223c0, such as BS16477-003 and CS22897008. Mr = 3.60M\u2299 is a point above which\nX(Ca)<X(Mg), and Mr = 5.76M\u2299 is a point in\nthe O-rich layer. Yemin , \u2206M , f , Mmix (out) and the\n6\n\n\fother values for each comparison are summarized\nin Table 3. Figure 14 shows comparisons between\nthe yields of our mixing-fallback models and the\nabundance patterns of EMP stars. In addition to\nthe abundance ratios of the elements heavier than\nSi, [C/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [Al/Fe] show reasonable\nagreements with the observations. The nucleosynthesis yields in the ejecta for selected isotopes at\nthe time around 150 seconds after the explosion\nare also given in Tables 4 to 7. To obtain these\ntables, the isotopes with their half-lives less than\n30 days except 56 Ni are radioactively decayed.\n5.\n\nIwamoto et al. (2006) suggests that the matter with large Ye (>0.5) can produce enough K.\n[Sc/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] can be enhanced by nucleosynthesis in high-entropy environments (a low-density\nmodification, UN05; Tominaga et al. 2007) or in a\njet-like explosion (Nagataki et al. 2003; Maeda\n& Nomoto 2003; Tominaga 2009), and further\nan enhancement of [Sc/Fe] can be realized if Ye\n(>0.5) (Pruet et al. 2004a, 2005; Fr\u00f6hlich et al.\n2006b; Iwamoto et al. 2006). [Co/Fe] and [Mn/Fe]\ncan be improved by the Ye modification in the\nSi-burning region (UN05; Tominaga et al. 2007)\nand [Mn/Fe] can also be enhanced by a neutrino\nprocess (Woosley & Weaver 1995; Yoshida et al.\n2008).\nMany of the solutions discussed above include\nthe the ejection of proton-rich (Ye >0.5) \"complete\nSi-burning\" matter. This does not contradict with\nour assumption that the neutron-rich (Ye <0.5)\n\"complete Si-burning\" matter is ejected. This is\nbecause both Ye >0.5 matter and Ye <0.5 matter\ncould be ejected simultaneously from the \"hotbubble region\" in the multi-dimensional simulations (e.g., Janka et al. 2003; Pruet et al. 2005).\nAlthough we do not include the proton-rich matter, the inclusion of the matter does not change\nthe present results because the contributions from\nthe proton-rich matter can merely be added to the\npresent results. The nucleosynthesis in the protonrich matter as well as the neutrino process will be\nconsidered elsewhere.\nThere also remains a possible problem in elements Mo, Ru and Rh. The observational data of\nthose elements is obtained in only two EMP stars\nHD122563 and HD88609 (see Honda et al. 2007).\nThe abundance patterns of them show continuously decreasing trends compared with the main\nr-process as a function of atomic number, from Sr\nto Yb (Z=38\u221270). Our models have [Mo/Fe]\u223c\n\u22125, [Ru/Fe]\u223c \u22122 and [Rh/Fe]\u223c \u22123, while\nHD122563 has [Mo/Fe]=\u22120.02, [Ru/Fe]=0.07 and\n[Rh/Fe]<0.45, and HD88609 has [Mo/Fe]=0.15,\n[Ru/Fe]=0.32 and [Rh/Fe]<0.70. Further observation will be needed to investigate whether high\nratios of Mo, Ru and Rh are typical in the weak\nr-process stars. Since there two stars are relatively\nmetal rich, [Fe/H] \u223c \u22123.0 (HD88609) and [Fe/H]\n\u223c \u22122.7 (HD122563), their abundance patterns\nmay be contaminated by several SNe, r-process\nand s-process.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this paper we assume uncertainty of Ye in the\ndeep regions below Mcut and mass ejection from\nthe regions for three models model-1301, model2501 and model-2520. Among those models, we\nobtain high [Sr,Y,Zr/Fe] (ranged from -1 to 1) only\nin the model-2520. The \"hypernova\" model-2520\ncan reproduce the observational data of Sr, Y and\nZr in addition to the elements from C to Zn.\nWe also find that the weak r-process elements\nare not contained in the \"normal\" supernova models 1301 & 2501, even though low Ye (>\n\u223c0.40) matter is ejected. In the normal supernova models,\nhowever, intermediate mass elements from Ga to\nRb may be abundantly ejected (Figure 10 and 11).\nIt is interesting to note that there have been no\nobservational evidences that Ga-Rb-rich stars exist in EMP stars. It is possible that normal SNe\ndo not eject sufficient amounts of low Ye matter\nor that we have observationally overlooked such\nGa-Rb-rich stars.\nIn comparisons with 4 EMP stars in Figure 14,\nthe ratios of some elements, i.e., [Na/Fe], [K/Fe],\n[Sc/Fe], [Mn/Fe] and [Co/Fe] show deficiencies\nfrom the observation as our previous finding (see\ne.g., UN05; Tominaga et al. 2007). In Tominaga\net al. (2007), possible solutions are discussed as\nfollows: Na is mostly synthesized in the C-shell\nburning, and the produced amount of Na depends\non the overshooting at the edge of the convective\nC-burning shell (Iwamoto et al. 2005). Since\nno overshooting is included in the present presupernova evolution models, the inclusion of the\novershooting could enhance the Na abundance.\n[K/Fe] is slightly enhanced by the \"low-density\"\nmodification (UN05; Tominaga et al. 2007) and\n\n7\n\n\fThere may be a solution in a high-entropy matter ejection. Pruet et al. (2006) investigated\nthe contribution of the proton-rich high-entropy\nwinds using the two-dimensional 15M\u2299 core collapse model of Janka et al. (2003). The origin of\nthe so-called p-process nuclei from A=92 to 126\nis an unsolved riddles of nuclear astrophysics, but\nthey found synthesis of p-rich nuclei up to 102 Pd in\nthe proton-rich wind, although their calculations\ndo not show an efficient production of 92 Mo. Ye of\nproton-rich neutrino wind in Pruet et al. (2006) is\nranged from 0.539 to 0.558, and entropy (s/kb ) is\nfrom 54.8 to 76.9. The entropy in the supernova\nshock model (s/kb <\n\u223c15) is much smaller. Since the\nproperties of the neutrino driven wind is uncertain, the nucleosynthesis in the proton-rich wind\nis certainly interesting, especially if there are no\nother possibilities.\nThe Ye below the mass cut is very sensitive to\nthe rates for the neutrino and positron captures on\nneutrons and for the inverse captures on protons.\nUnfortunately the actual amount of neutrino flux\ndepends on the unknown explosion mechanisms.\nTherefore, the Ye of ejecta for a specific model\nneeds to be calculated in the future works.\nIn Figure 15 we show [Sr/Fe] vs. [Zn/Fe] because [Zn/Fe] is a rough barometer of the SN explosion energy (e.g., UN02, UN05). The implications obtained from this figure are as follows.\nWe have shown that the weak r-process elements\ncan be produced without introducing extra higherentropy matter in high E SN models. Previous\nwork (UN02) suggests that the abundance of EMP\nstars with high [Zn/Fe] are reproduced by high E\nSN models. The apparent no-correlation between\n[Sr/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] means that, if our interpretation is correct, only a portion of HNe eject a\nlarge amount of Sr but the rest of HNe eject a\nsmall amount of Sr. In other words high E is just\na necessary condition to eject the weak r-process\nelements and other factors determine the ejected\nmass of the weak r-process elements.\nOur results show that normal E models do not\nproduce large amount of Sr, Y, and Zr. However we should note that this is not the case if a\nnormal SN ejects somehow higher-entropy matter\nthan the supernova shock. Figure 15 does not deny\nsuch a possibility because [Zn/Fe]\u223c0 stars may be\nreproduced by a normal SNe or the mixture of several SNe (Tominaga et al. 2007). This figure show\n\nthat all [Zn/Fe]\u223c0 stars show high [Sr/Fe]. A possible interpretation is that the actual normal SNe\ncan produce [Sr/Fe]\u223c 0. If this is the case, our\nresults imply that a normal SN can be ejecting a\nhigher entropy matter than the supernova shock,\nthat is likely the neutrino driven wind. This fact\nmay be used to constrain the neutrino driven wind\nof a normal SN, though we have to handle the\nYe >0.5 matter before qualitatively constraining\nthe model, because the high-entropy proton-rich\nmatter may also produce the weak r-process elements as shown in Pruet et al. (2006).\nWe would like to thank T. Yoshida, W. Aoki\nand S. Wanajo for useful comments and discussions.
