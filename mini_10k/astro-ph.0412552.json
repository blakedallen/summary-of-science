CHEMICAL UNIFORMITY AT HIGH Z?\nIn stark contrast to many interstellar lines-of-sight in the\nMilky Way or the Magellanic Clouds, high-redshift DLA\nsystems usually appear to be chemically uniform [1]. But\ndespite their chemical uniformity, for any redshift the observed metallicities are different by up to two orders of\nmagnitude [2].\nThe known DLA systems make a heterogeneous population involving very different physical environments \u2013 a\nvery unfavorable precondition for tracing nucleosythesis\nand the chemical evolution of galaxies. But the physical\nenvironments of molecular clouds are less diverse. In fact,\nfor the known H2 -bearing DLA systems the metallicityredshift distribution may exhibit less variation than for the\nregular DLA systems [3].\nMolecular hydrogen is detected in DLA components exhibiting high particle densities and low kinetic temperatures [4, 5]. The metallicity of DLA systems is usually\ncalculated by averaging ad hoc radial velocity intervals,\ni.e. by averaging several absorption components. But the\ndepletion of chemical elements in H2 -bearing components\nmay surpass the average by up to one order of magnitude\n[4, 5]. Moreover, narrow components arising from cold\ngas are blurred in the usually complex absorption profiles.\nIn fact, high-resolution (55 000) and exceptionally high\nsignal-to-noise (90-140) spectra of the H2 -bearing DLA\nsystem toward the QSO HE 0515\u20134414 indicate the hitherto unperceived chemical nonuniformity of individual\nmetal absorption profile components, similar to the interstellar lines-of-sight intersecting Galactic warm disk and\nhalo clouds (Figs. 1, 2). In addition, for the H2 -bearing\ncomponents the calculated [6] fraction of iron in dust of\n1416\n\n98 percent is close to that of Galactic cold disk gas. Is\nthe DLA system toward HE 0515\u20134414 just a rare case,\nor are compact high-metallicity dust clouds systematically\nmissed in present spectroscopic observations due to insufficient resolution or low signal-to-noise ratio?\n\n2. FAINT QSOS OBSCURED BY DUST?\nThe possibility that present surveys of DLA systems are\naffected by dust is an ongoing concern: If the extinction of\nDLA absorbers is high enough, optical surveys will miss\nthe QSOs behind them. However, present samples of DLA\nabsorbers toward radio-selected and SDSS QSOs do not\nindicate any distinct selection bias due to dust [8, 9].\nIn contrats, the new H/ESO survey of DLA systems toward a complete subsample of 182 HE QSOs produces\nconvincing evidence for the effect of dust attenuation: Four\nnew DLA systems were discovered toward the bright half\nof the QSO subsample, but 14 were detected toward the\nfaint. The probability for both numbers being drawn from\nthe same Poissonian is less than 2.5 percent (Fig. 3). Do\nthe DLA systems toward the fainter QSOs exhibit more\ndust than those toward the bright?\n\n3. FUTURE AIMS\nIn order to study the possible biases and selection effects\ninvolved with duts, we aim at starting a sound abundance\ndatabase established on high-resolution and high signalto-noise spectroscopy of the complete sample of DLA systems discovered by the H/ESO survey.
