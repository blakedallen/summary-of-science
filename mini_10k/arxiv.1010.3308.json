Bibliography: 18 titles.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe theory of shadowing of approximate trajectories (pseudotrajectories) in\ndynamical systems is now well developed (see, for example, the monographs\n[1, 2]). At the same time, the problem of complete description of systems\nhaving the shadowing property seems unsolvable. We have no hope to characterize systems with the shadowing property in terms of the theory of structural stability (such as hyperbolicity and transversality) since the shadowing\nproperty is preserved under homeomorphisms of the phase space (at least in\nthe compact case), while the above-mentioned properties are not.\n\u2217\n\nFaculty of Mathematics and Mechanics, St.Petersburg State University, University\nav. 28, 198504, St. Petersburg, Russia, sp@sp1196.spb.edu\n\u2020\nDepartment of Mathematics, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Section 4, Roosevelt\nRoad, Taipei 106, Taiwan, , sergey.tikhomirov@gmail.com.\n\u2021\nResearch of the second author is supported by NSC (Taiwan) 98-2811-M-002-061.\n\n1\n\n\fThe situation changes completely when we pass from the set of smooth\ndynamical systems having the shadowing property (or some of its analogs)\nto its C1 -interior. It was shown by Sakai [3] that the C1 -interior of the set\nof diffeomorphisms with the shadowing property coincides with the set of\nstructurally stable diffeomorphisms. Later, a similar result was obtained for\nthe set of diffeomorphisms with the orbital shadowing property [4].\nIn this context, there is a real difference between the cases of discrete\ndynamical systems generated by diffeomorphisms and systems with continuous time (flows) generated by smooth vector fields. This difference is due\nto the necessity of reparametrizing shadowing trajectories in the latter case.\nOne of the main goals of the present paper is to show that this difference\nis crucial, and the results for flows are essentially different from those for\ndiffeomorphisms.\nLet us pass to the main definitions and results. Let M be a smooth closed\n(i.e., compact and boundaryless) manifold with Riemannian metric dist and\nlet n = dim M. Consider a smooth (C1 ) vector field on X and denote by \u03c6\nthe flow of X. We denote by\nO(x, \u03c6) = {\u03c6(t, x) : t \u2208 R}\nthe trajectory of a point x in the flow \u03c6; O + (x, \u03c6) and O \u2212 (x, \u03c6) are the\npositive and negative semitrajectories, respectively.\nFix a number d > 0. We say that a mapping g : R \u2192 M (not necessarily\ncontinuous) is a d-pseudotrajectory (both for the field X and flow \u03c6) if\ndist(g(\u03c4 + t), \u03c6(t, g(\u03c4 ))) < d for \u03c4 \u2208 R, t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\n(1)\n\nA reparametrization is an increasing homeomorphism h of the line R; we\ndenote by Rep the set of all reparametrizations.\nFor a > 0, we denote\n\u001a\n\u001b\nh(t) \u2212 h(s)\nRep(a) = h \u2208 Rep :\n\u2212 1 < a, t, s \u2208 R, t 6= s .\nt\u2212s\nIn this paper, we consider the following three shadowing properties (and\nthe corresponding sets of dynamical systems).\nWe say that a vector field X has the standard shadowing property (X \u2208\nStSh) if for any \u03b5 > 0 we can find d > 0 such that for any d-pseudotrajectory\ng(t) of X there exists a point p \u2208 M and a reparametrization h \u2208 Rep(\u03b5)\nsuch that\ndist(g(t), \u03c6(h(t), p)) < \u03b5 for t \u2208 R.\n(2)\n2\n\n\fWe say that a vector field X has the oriented shadowing property (X \u2208\nOrientSh) if for any \u03b5 > 0 we can find d > 0 such that for any d-pseudotrajectory\nof X there exists a point p \u2208 M and a reparametrization h \u2208 Rep such that\ninequalities (2) hold (thus, it is not assumed that the reparametrization h is\nclose to identity).\nFinally, we say that a vector field X has the orbital shadowing property\n(X \u2208 OrbitSh) if for any \u03b5 > 0 we can find d > 0 such that for any dpseudotrajectory of X there exists a point p \u2208 M such that\ndistH (Cl O(p, \u03c6), Cl{g(t) : t \u2208 R}) < \u03b5,\nwhere distH is the Hausdorff distance.\nLet us note that the standard shadowing property is equivalent to the\nstrong pseudo orbit tracing property (POTP) in the sense of Komuro [5];\nthe oriented shadowing property was called the normal POTP by Komuro\n[5] and the POTP for flows by Thomas [6].\nWe consider the following C1 metric on the space of smooth vector fields:\nIf X and Y are vector fields of class C1 , we set\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202X\n\u2202Y\n\u03c11 (X, Y ) = max |X(x) \u2212 Y (x)| +\n(x) \u2212\n(x) ,\nx\u2208M\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nwhere |.| is the norm on the tangent space Tx M generated by the Riemannian\nmetric dist, and k.k is the corresponding operator norm for matrices.\nFor a set A of vector fields, Int1 (A) denotes the interior of A in the C1\ntopology generated by the metric \u03c11 .\nLet us denote by S and N the sets of structurally stable and nonsingular\nvector fields, respectively.\nThe only result in the problem under study was recently published by\nLee and Sakai [7]: Int1 (StSh \u2229 N) \u2282 S.\nTo formulate our main results, we need one more definition.\nLet us say that a vector field X belongs to the class B if X has two\nhyperbolic rest points p and q (not necessarily different) with the following\nproperties:\n(1) The Jacobi matrix DX(q) has two complex conjugate eigenvalues\n\u03bc1,2 = a1 \u00b1 ib1 of multiplicity one with a1 < 0 such that if \u03bb 6= \u03bc1,2 is an\neigenvalue of DX(q) with Re\u03bb < 0, then Re\u03bb < a1 ;\n(2) the Jacobi matrix DX(p) has two complex conjugate eigenvalues\n\u03bd1,2 = a2 \u00b1 ib2 with a2 > 0 of multiplicity one such that if \u03bb 6= \u03bd1,2 is\nan eigenvalue of DX(p) with Re\u03bb > 0, then Re\u03bb > a2 ;\n3\n\n\f(3) the stable manifold W s (p) and the unstable manifold W u (q) have a\ntrajectory of nontransverse intersection.\nCondition (1) above means that the \"weakest\" contraction in W s (q) is\ndue to the eigenvalues \u03bc1,2 (condition (2) has a similar meaning).\nTheorem 1. Int1 (OrientSh \\B) = S.\nLet us note that Theorem 1 was stated (without a proof) in the author's\nshort note [8]. Let us also note that if dimM \u2264 3, then Int1 (OrientSh) = S\n(which also was stated in [8] and proved by the second author in [9]; in\n[9], it was also shown that if LipSh is the set of vector fields that have\nan analog of the standard shadowing property with \u03b5 replaced by Ld, then\nInt1 (LipSh) = S).\nTheorem 2. Int1 (OrientSh) \u2229 B =\n6 \u2205.\nTheorem 3. Int1 (OrbitSh \u2229 N) \u2282 S.\nLet us note that Theorem 3 generalizes the above-mentioned result by\nLee and Sakai.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: In Sec. 2, we prove Theorem 1\nand discuss the proof of Theorem 3; in Sec. 3, we prove Theorem 2.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nFirst we introduce some notation.\nWe denote by B(a, A) the a-neighborhood of a set A \u2282 M.\nThe term \"transverse section\" will mean a smooth open disk in M of\ncodimension 1 that is transverse to the flow \u03c6 at any of its points.\nLet Per(X) denote the set of rest points and closed orbits of a vector field\nX.\nLet us recall that X is called a Kupka-Smale field (X \u2208 KS) if\n(KS1) any trajectory in Per(X) is hyperbolic;\n(KS2) stable and unstable manifolds of trajectories from Per(X) are\ntransverse.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is based on the following result (see [10]): Int1 (KS) =\nS.\nLet T denote the set of vector fields X that have property (KS1). Our first\nlemma is applied in the proofs of both Theorems 1 and 3; for this purpose,\nwe formulate and prove it for the set OrbitSh.\n4\n\n\fLemma 1.\nInt1 (OrbitSh) \u2282 T .\n\n(3)\n\nProof. To get a contradiction, let us assume that that there exists a\nvector field X \u2208 Int1 (OrbitSh) that does not have property (KS1), i.e., the\nset Per(X) contains a trajectory p that is not hyperbolic.\nLet us first consider the case where p is a rest point. Identify M with Rn\nin a neighborhood of p. Applying an arbitrarily C1 -small perturbation of the\nfield X, we can find a field Y \u2208 Int1 (OrbitSh) that is linear in a neighborhood\nU of p (we also assume that p is the origin of U).\n(Here and below in the proof of Lemma 1, all the perturbations are C1 small perturbations that leave the field in Int1 (OrbitSh); we denote the perturbed fields by the same symbol X and their flows by \u03c6.)\nThen trajectories of X in U are governed by a differential equation\n\u1e8b = P x,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the matrix P has an eigenvalue \u03bb with Re\u03bb = 0.\nConsider first the case where \u03bb = 0. We perturb the field X (and change\ncoordinates, if necessary) so that, in Eq. (4), the matrix P is block-diagonal,\nP = diag(0, P1 ),\n\n(5)\n\nand P1 is an (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrix.\nRepresent coordinate x in U as x = (y, z) with respect to (5); then\n\u03c6(t, (y, z)) = (y, exp(P1 t)z)\nin U.\nTake \u01eb > 0 such that B(4\u01eb, p) \u2282 U. To get a contradiction, assume that\nX \u2208 OrbitSh; let d correspond to the chosen \u01eb.\nFix a natural number m and consider the following mapping from R into\nU:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2y = \u22122\u01eb, z = 0; t \u2264 0,\ng(t) = y = \u22122\u01eb + t/m, z = 0; 0 < t < 4m\u01eb,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ny = 2\u01eb, z = 0; 4m\u01eb < t.\nSince the mapping g is continuous, piecewise differentiable, and either\n\u1e8f = 0 or \u1e8f = 1/m, g is a d-pseudotrajectory for large m.\n5\n\n\fAny trajectory of X in U belongs to a plane y = const; hence,\ndistH (Cl(O(q, \u03c6)), Cl({g(t) : t \u2208 R})) \u2265 2\u01eb\nfor any q. This completes the proof in the case considered.\nSimilar reasoning works if p is a rest point and the matrix P in (4) has a\npair of eigenvalues \u00b1ib, b 6= 0.\nNow we assume that p is a nonhyperbolic closed trajectory. In this case,\nwe perturb the vector field X in a neighborhood of the trajectory p using\nthe perturbation technique developed by Pugh and Robinson in [11]. Let us\nformulate their result (which will be used below several times).\nPugh-Robinson pertubation. Assume that r1 is not a rest point of a\nvector field X. Let r2 = \u03c6(\u03c4, r1), where \u03c4 > 0. Let \u03a31 and \u03a32 be two small\ntransverse sections such that ri \u2208 \u03a3i , i = 1, 2. Let \u03c3 be the local Poincar\u00e9\ntransformation generated by these transverse sections.\nConsider a point r \u2032 = \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 , r1 ), where \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ), and let U be an arbitrary\nopen set containing r \u2032 .\nFix an arbitrary C 1 -neighborhood F of the field X.\nThere exist positive numbers \u03b50 and \u22060 with the following property: if \u03c3 \u2032\nis a local diffeomorphism from the \u22060 -neighborhood of r1 in \u03a31 into \u03a32 such\nthat\ndistC 1 (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) < \u03b50 ,\nthen there exists a vector field X \u2032 \u2208 F such that\n(1) X \u2032 = X outside U;\n(2) \u03c3 \u2032 is the local Poincar\u00e9 transformation generated by the sections \u03a31\nand \u03a32 and trajectories of the field X \u2032 .\nLet \u03c9 be the least positive period of the nonhyperbolic closed trajectory\np. We fix a point \u03c0 \u2208 p, local coordinates in which \u03c0 is the center, and\na hyperplane \u03a3 of codimension 1 transverse to the vector F (\u03c0). Let y be\ncoordinate in \u03a3.\nLet \u03c3 be the local Poincar\u00e9 transformation generated by the transverse\nsection \u03a3; denote P = D\u03c3(0). Our assumption implies that the matrix P is\nnot hyperbolic. In an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the matrix P , we can\nfind a matrix P \u2032 such that P \u2032 either has a real eigenvalue with unit absolute\nvalue of multiplicity 1 or a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with unit\nabsolute value of multiplicity 1. In both cases, we can choose coordinates\ny = (v, w) in \u03a3 in which\nP \u2032 = diag(Q, P1 ),\n(6)\n6\n\n\fwhere Q is a 1 \u00d7 1 or 2 \u00d7 2 matrix such that |Qv| = |v| for any v.\nNow we can apply the Pugh-Robinson perturbation (taking r1 = r2 = \u03c0\nand \u03a31 = \u03a32 = \u03a3) that modifies X in a small neighborhood of the point\n\u03c6(\u03c9/2, \u03c0) and such that, for the perturbed vector field X \u2032 , the local Poincar\u00e9\ntransformation generated by the transverse section \u03a3 is given by y 7\u2192 P \u2032 y.\nClearly, in this case, the trajectory of \u03c0 in the field X \u2032 is still closed\n(with some period \u03c9 \u2032 ). As was mentioned, we assume that X \u2032 has the orbital\nshadowing property (and write X, \u03c6, \u03c9 instead of X \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ).\nWe introduce in a neighborhood of the point \u03c0 coordinates x = (x\u2032 , y),\nwhere x\u2032 is one-dimensional (with axis parallel to X(\u03c0)), and y has the abovementioned property.\nOf course, the new coordinates generate a new metric, but this new metric\nis equivalent to the original one; thus, the corresponding shadowing property\n(or its absence) is preserved.\nWe need below one more technical statement.\nLE (local estimate).There exists a neighborhood W of the origin in\n\u03a3 and constants l, \u03b40 > 0 with the following property: if z1 \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 W and\n|z2 \u2212 z1 | < \u03b4 < \u03b40 , then we can represent z2 as \u03c6(\u03c4, z2\u2032 ) with z2\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3 and\n|\u03c4 |, |z2\u2032 \u2212 z1 | < l\u03b4.\n\n(7)\n\nThis statement is an immediate corollary of the theorem on local rectification of trajectories (see, for example, [12]): In a neighborhood of a point\nthat is not a rest point, the flow of a vector field of class C 1 is diffeomorphic\nto the family of parallel lines along which points move with unit speed (and\nit is enough to note that a diffemorphic image of \u03a3 is a smooth submanifold\ntransverse to lines of the family).\nWe may assume that the neighborhood W in LE is so small that for\ny \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 W , the function \u03b1(y) (the time of first return to \u03a3) is defined, and\nthat the point \u03c6(\u03b1(v, w), (0, v, w)) has coordinates (Qv, P1 w) in \u03a3.\nLet us take a neighborhood U of the trajectory p such that if r \u2208 U,\nthen the first point of intersection of the positive semitrajectory of r with \u03a3\nbelongs to W .\nTake a > 0 such that the 4a-neighborhood of the origin in \u03a3 is a subset\nof W .

Hence, we can take a so small that\nB(2a, Cl({g(t) : t \u2208 R})) \u2282 U.\nSince\n\na\nk + 1 k+1\nk k+1\nQ v0 \u2212\nQ v0 =\n\u2192 0,\nN\nN\nN\n\nN \u2192 \u221e,\n\ng(t) is a d-pseudotrajectory for large N.\nAssume that there exists a point q such that\ndistH (Cl(O(q, \u03c6)), Cl({g(t) : t \u2208 R})) < \u01eb.\nIn this case, O(q, \u03c6) \u2282 U, and there exist points q1 , q2 \u2208 O(q, \u03c6) such that\n|q1 | = |q1 \u2212 (0, 0, 0)| < \u01eb\nand\n|q2 \u2212 (0, QN v0 , 0)| < \u01eb.\nBy the choice of \u01eb, there exist points q1\u2032 , q2\u2032 \u2208 O(q, \u03c6) \u2229 \u03a3 such that\n|q1\u2032 | < l\u01eb < a/4 and |q2\u2032 \u2212 QN v0 | < l\u01eb < a/4.\nLet q1\u2032 = (0, v1 , w1 ) and q2\u2032 = (0, v2 , w2 ). Since these points belong to the\nsame trajectory that is contained in U, |v1 | = |v2 |. At the same time,\n|v1 | < a/4,\n\n|v2 \u2212 QN v0 | < a/4,\n8\n\nand |QN v0 | = a,\n\n\fand we get a contradiction which proves our lemma.\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 1, we show that any vector field\nX \u2208 Int1 (OrientSh \\ B)\nhas property (KS2).\nTo get a contradiction, let us assume that there exist trajectories p, q \u2208\nPer(X) for which the unstable manifold W u (q) and the stable manifold W s (p)\nhave a point r of nontransverse intersection. We have to consider separately\nthe following two cases.\nCase (B1): p and q are rest points of the flow \u03c6.\nCase (B2): either p or q is a closed trajectory.\nCase (B1). Since X \u2208\n/ B, we may assume (after an additional perturbation, if necessary) that the eigenvalues \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbu with Re\u03bbj > 0 of the Jacobi\nmatrix DX(p) have the following property:\nRe\u03bbj > \u03bb1 > 0,\n\nj = 2, . . . , u\n\n(where u is the dimension of W u (p)). This property means that there exists\na one-dimensional \"direction of weakest expansion\" in W u (p).\nIf this is not the case, then our assumption that X \u2208\n/ B implies that the\neigenvalues \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcs with Re\u03bcj < 0 of the Jacobi matrix DX(q) have the\nfollowing property:\nRe\u03bcj < \u03bc1 < 0,\n\nj = 2, . . . , s\n\n(where s is the dimension of W s (q)). If this condition holds, we reduce\nthe problem to the previous case by passing from the field X to the field\n\u2212X (clearly, the fields X and \u2212X have the oriented shadowing property\nsimultaneously).\nMaking a perturbation (in this part of the proof, we always assume that\nthe perturbed field belongs to the set OrientSh \\ B), we may \"linearize\" the\nfield X in a neighborhood U of the point p; thus, trajectories of X in U are\ngoverned by a differential equation\n\u1e8b = P x,\nwhere\nP = diag(Ps , Pu ),\n\nPu = diag(\u03bb, P1 ),\n9\n\n\u03bb > 0,\n\n(8)\n\n\fP1 is a (u \u2212 1) \u00d7 (u \u2212 1) matrix for which there exist constants K > 0 and\n\u03bc > \u03bb such that\nk exp(\u2212P1 t)k \u2264 K \u22121 exp(\u2212\u03bct),\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(9)\n\nand Re\u03bbj < 0 for the eigenvalues \u03bbj of the matrix Ps .\nLet us explain how to perform the above-mentioned perturbations preserving the nontransversalty of W u (q) and W s (p) at the point r (we note\nthat a similar reasoning can be used in \"replacement\" of a component of\nintersection of W u (q) with a transverse section \u03a3 by an affine space, see the\ntext preceding Lemma 2 below).\nConsider points r \u2217 = \u03c6(\u03c4, r), where \u03c4 > 0, and r \u2032 = \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 , r), where\n\u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ). Let \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2217 be small transverse sections that contain the points\nr and r \u2217 . Take small neighborhoods V and U \u2032 of p and r \u2032 , respectively, so\nthat the set V does not intersect the \"tube\" formed by pieces of trajectories\nthrough points of U \u2032 whose endpoints belong to \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2217 . In this case, if we\nperturb the vector field X in V and apply the Pugh-Robinson perturbation\nin U \u2032 , these perturbations are \"independent.\"\nWe perturb the vector field X in V obtaining vector fields X \u2032 that are\nlinear in small neighborhoods V \u2032 \u2282 V and such that the values \u03c11 (X, X \u2032 ) are\narbitrarily small.\nLet \u03b3 s and \u03b3 \u2217s be the components of intersection of the stable manifold\nW s (p) (for the field X) with \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2217 that contain the points r and r \u2217 ,\nrespectively.\nSince the stable manifold of a hyperbolic rest point depends (on its compact subsets) C 1 -smoothly on C 1 -small perturbations, the stable manifolds\nW s (p) (for the perturbed fields X \u2032 ) contain components \u03b3 \u2032s of intersection\nwith \u03a3\u2217 that converge (in the C 1 metric) to \u03b3 \u2217s .\nNow we apply the Pugh-Robinson perturbation in U \u2032 and find a field X \u2032\nin an arbitrary C 1 neighborhood of X such that the local Poincar\u00e9 transformation generated by the field X \u2032 and sections \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2217 takes \u03b3 \u2032s to \u03b3 s (which\nmeans that the nontransversality at r is preserved).\nWe introduce in U coordinates x = (y; v, w) according to (8): y is coordinate in the s-dimensional \"stable\" subspace (denoted E s ); (v, w) are\ncoordinates in the u-dimensional \"unstable\" subspace (denoted E u ). The\none-dimensional coordinate v corresponds to the eigenvalue \u03bb (and hence to\nthe one-dimensional \"direction of weakest expansion\" in E u ).\n\n10\n\n\fIn the neighborhood U,\n\u03c6(t, (y, v, w)) = (exp(Ps t)y; exp(\u03bbt)v, exp(P1 t)w),\nand it follows from (9) that\n| exp(P1 t)w| \u2265 K exp(\u03bct)|w|,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(10)\n\nDenote by E1u the one-dimensional invariant subspace corresponding to \u03bb.\nWe naturally identify E s \u2229 U and E u \u2229 U with the intersections of U with\nthe corresponding local stable and unstable manifolds of p, respectively.\nLet us construct a special transverse section for the flow \u03c6. We may\nassume that the point r of nontransverse intersection of W u (q) and W s (p)\nbelongs to U. Take a hyperplane \u03a3\u2032 in E s of dimension s\u22121 that is transverse\nto the vector X(r). Set \u03a3 = \u03a3\u2032 + E u ; clearly, \u03a3 is transverse to X(r).\nBy a perturbation of the field X outside U, we may get the following: in\na neighborhood of r, the component of intersection W u (q) \u2229 \u03a3 containing r\n(for the perturbed field) has the form of an affine space r + L, where L is\nthe tangent space, L = Tr (W u (q) \u2229 \u03a3), of the intersection W u (q) \u2229 \u03a3 at the\npoint r for the unperturbed field (compare, for example, with [7]).\nLet \u03a3r be a small transverse disk in \u03a3 containing the point r. Denote by\n\u03b3 the component of intersection of W u (q) \u2229 \u03a3r containing r.\nLemma 2. There exists \u03b5 > 0 such that if x \u2208 \u03a3r and\ndist(\u03c6(t, x), O \u2212 (r, \u03c6)) < \u03b5,\n\nt \u2264 0,\n\n(11)\n\nthen x \u2208 \u03b3.\nProof. To simplify presentation, let us assume that q is a rest point; the\ncase of a closed trajectory is considered using a similar reasoning.\nBy the Grobman-Hartman theorem, there exists \u03b50 > 0 such that the\nflow of X in B(2\u03b50 , q) is topologically conjugate to the flow of a linear vector\nfield.\ns\nDenote by A the intersection of the local stable manifold of q, Wloc\n(q),\nwith the boundary of the ball B(2\u03b50 , q).\nTake a negative time T such that if s = \u03c6(T, r), then\n\u03c6(t, s) \u2208 B(\u03b50 , q),\n\nt \u2264 0.\n\nClearly, if \u03b50 is small enough, then the compact sets A and\nB = {\u03c6(t, r) : T \u2264 t \u2264 0}\n11\n\n(12)\n\n\fare disjoint. There exists a positive number \u03b51 < \u03b50 such that the \u03b51 neighborhoods of the sets A and B are disjoint as well.\nTake \u03b52 \u2208 (0, \u03b51). There exists a neighborhood V of the point s with the\nu\nfollowing property: if y \u2208 V \\Wloc\n(q), then the first point of intersection of the\nnegative semitrajectory of y with the boundary of B(2\u03b50 , q) belongs to the \u03b52 neighborhood of the set A (this statement is obvious for a neighborhood of a\nsaddle rest point of a linear vector field; by the Grobman-Hartman theorem,\nit holds for X as well).\nClearly, there exists a small transverse disk \u03a3s containing s and such\nu\nthat if y \u2208 \u03a3s \u2229 Wloc\n(q), then the first point of intersection of the positive\nsemitrajectory of y with the disk \u03a3r belongs to \u03b3 (in addition, we assume\nthat \u03a3s belongs to the chosen neighborhood V ).\nThere exists \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52 ) such that the flow of X generates a local\nPoincar\u00e9 transformation\n\u03c3 : \u03a3r \u2229 B(\u03b5, r) \u2192 \u03a3s .\nLet us show that this \u03b5 has the desired property. It follows from our choice\nof \u03a3s and (11) with t = 0 that if x \u2208\n/ \u03b3, then\nu\ny := \u03c3(x) \u2208 \u03a3s \\ Wloc\n(q);\n\nin this case, there exists \u03c4 < 0 such that the point z = \u03c6(\u03c4, y) belongs to the\nintersection of B(\u03b52 , A) with the boundary of B(2\u03b50 , q).

Our lemma is proved.\nNow let us formulate the property of nontransversality of W u (q) and\nW s (p) at the point r in terms of the introduced objects.\nLet \u03a0u be the projection to E u parallel to E s .\nThe transversality of W u (q) and W s (p) at r means that\nTr W u (q) + Tr W s (p) = Rn .\n\n12\n\n\fSince \u03a3 is a transverse section to the flow \u03c6 at r, the above equality is\nequivalent to the equality\nL + E s = Rn .\nThus, the nontransversality means that\nL + E s 6= Rn ,\nwhich implies that\nL\u2032 := \u03a0u L 6= E u .\n\n(15)\n\nWe claim that there exists a linear isomorphism J of \u03a3 for which the\nnorm kJ \u2212 Idk is arbitrarily small and such that\n\u03a0u JL \u2229 E1u = {0}.\n\n(16)\n\nLet e be a unit vector of the line E1u .

Since L\u2032 6= E u , there exists a\nvector v \u2208 E u \\ L\u2032 .\nFix a natural number N and consider a unit vector vN that is parallel to\nNe + v. Clearly, vN \u2192 e as N \u2192 \u221e. There exists a sequence TN of linear\nisomorphisms of E u such that TN vN = e and\nkTN \u2212 Idk \u2192 0,\n\nN \u2192 \u221e.\n\nNote that TN\u22121 e is parallel to vN ; hence, TN\u22121 e does not belong to L\u2032 , and\nTN \u03a0u L \u2229 E1u = {0}.\n\n(17)\n\nDefine an isomorphism JN of \u03a3 by\nJN (y, z) = (y, TN z)\nand note that\nkJN \u2212 Idk \u2192 0,\n\nN \u2192 \u221e.\n\nLet LN = JN L. Equality (17) implies that\n\u03a0u LN \u2229 E1u = {0}.\nOur claim is proved.\n13\n\n(18)\n\n\fFirst we consider the case where dimE u \u2265 2. Since dimL\u2032 < dimE u by\n(15) and dimE1u = 1, our reasoning above (combined with a Pugh-Robinson\nperturbation) shows that we may assume that\nL\u2032 \u2229 E1u = {0}.\n\n(19)\n\nFor this purpose, we take a small transverse section \u03a3\u2032 containing the point\nr \u2032 = \u03c6(\u22121, r), denote by \u03b3 the component of intersection of W u (q) with \u03a3\u2032\ncontaining r \u2032 , and note that the local Poincar\u00e9 transformation \u03c3 generated\nby \u03a3\u2032 and \u03a3 takes \u03b3 to the linear space L (in local coordinates of \u03a3). The\nmapping \u03c3N = JN \u03c3 is C 1 -close to \u03c3 for large N and takes \u03b3 to LN for which\nequality (18) is valid. Thus, we get equality (19) for the perturbed vector\nfield.\nThis equality implies that there exists a constant C > 0 such that if\n(y; v, w) \u2208 r + L, then\n|v| \u2264 C|w|.\n(20)\nFix a > 0 such that B(4a, p) \u2282 U.

Assume that\nl, \u03b40 > 0 are chosen for \u03a3 so that the LE holds.\nTake \u01eb \u2208 (0, min(\u03b40 , \u03b50 , a/2)) so small that if |y \u2212 r| < \u01eb, then \u03c6(t, y)\nintersects \u03a3 at a point s such that\ndist(\u03c6(t, s), r) < \u03b50 ,\n15\n\n|t| \u2264 l\u03b5.\n\n(26)\n\n\fConsider the corresponding d and a d-pseudotrajectory g described above.\nAssume that\ndist(\u03c6(h(t), x), g(t)) < \u01eb, t \u2208 R,\n(27)\nfor some point x and reparametrization h and set y = \u03c6(h(0), x).\nThen |y \u2212 r| < \u03b5, and there exists a point s = \u03c6(\u03c4, y) \u2208 \u03a3 with |\u03c4 | < l\u03b5.\nIf \u2212l\u03b5 \u2264 t \u2264 0, then\ndist(\u03c6(t, s), O \u2212 (r, \u03c6)) \u2264 \u01eb0\nby (26).\nIf t < \u2212l\u03b5, then h(0) + \u03c4 + t < h(0), and there exists t\u2032 < 0 such that\n\u2032\nh(t ) = h(0) + \u03c4 + t.

If \u01eb is small enough, then |s \u2212 r| < b, where b\nsatisfies the condition of Lemma 3, whose conclusion contradicts (27).\nThis completes the consideration of case (B1) for dimW u (p) \u2265 2. If\ndimW u (p) = 1, then the nontransversality of W u (q) and W s (p) implies that\nL \u2282 E s . This case is trivial since any shadowing trajectory passing close\nto r must belong to the intersection W u (q) \u2229 W s (p), while we can contruct\na pseudotrajectory \"going away\" from p along W u (p). If dimW u (p) = 0,\nW u (q) and W s (p) cannot have a point of nontransverse intersection.\nCase (B2). Passing from the vector field X to \u2212X, if necessary, we may\nassume that p is a closed trajectory. We \"linearize\" X in a neighborhood of\np as described in the proof of Lemma 1 so that the local Poincar\u00e9 transformation of transverse section \u03a3 is a linear mapping generated by a matrix P\nwith the following properties: With respect to some coordinates in \u03a3,\nP = diag(Ps , Pu ),\n\n(28)\n\nwhere |\u03bbj | < 1 for the eigenvalues \u03bbj of the matrix Ps , and |\u03bbj | > 1 for the\neigenvalues \u03bbj of the matrix Pu , every eigenvalue has multiplicity 1, and P\nis in a Jordan form.\nThe same reasoning as in case (B1) shows that it is possible to perform\nsuch a \"linearization\" (and other perturbations of X performed below) so\nthat the nontransversality of W u (q) and W s (p) is preserved.\n16\n\n\fConsider an eigenvalue \u03bb of Pu such that |\u03bb| \u2264 |\u03bc| for the remaining\neigenvalues \u03bc of Pu .\nWe treat separately the following two cases.\nCase (B2.1): \u03bb \u2208 R.\nCase (B2.2): \u03bb \u2208 C \\ R.\nCase (B2.1). Applying a perturbation, we may assume that\nPu = diag(\u03bb, P1 ),\nwhere |\u03bb| < |\u03bc| for the eigenvalues \u03bc of the matrix P1 (thus, there exists a\none-dimensional direction of \"weakest expansion\" in W u (p)). In this case,\nwe apply precisely the same reasoning as that applied to treat case (B1) (we\nleave details to the reader).\nCase (B2.2). Applying one more perturbation of X, we may assume that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0m1 i\n\u03bb = \u03bd + i\u03b7 = \u03c1 exp\n,\nm\nwhere m1 and m are relatively prime natural numbers, and\nPu = diag(Q, P1 ),\nwhere\nQ=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bd \u2212\u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\nwith respect to some coordinates (y, v, w) in \u03a3, where \u03c1 = |\u03bb| < |\u03bc| for the\neigenvalues \u03bc of the matrix P1 .\nDenote\nE s = {(y, 0, 0)},\n\nE u = {(0, v, w)},\n\nE1u = {(0, v, 0)}.\n\nThus, E s is the \"stable subspace,\" E u is the \"unstable subspace,\" and E1u is\nthe two-dimensional \"unstable subspace of the weakest expansion.\"\nGeometrically, the Poincar\u00e9 transformation \u03c3 : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3 (extended as\na linear mapping to E1u ) acts on E1u as follows: the radius of a point is\nmultiplied by \u03c1, while 2\u03c0m1 /m is added to the polar angle.\nAs in the proof of Lemma 1, we take a small neighborhood W of the\norigin of the transverse section \u03a3 so that, for points x \u2208 W , the function\n\u03b1(x) (the time of first return to \u03a3) is defined.\n17\n\n\fWe assume that the point r of nontransverse intersection\nW (p) belongs to the section \u03a3. Similarly to case (B1), we\nthat, in a neighborhood of r, the component of intersection\ncontaining r has the form of an affine space, r + L.\nLet \u03a0u be the projection in \u03a3 to E u parallel to E s , and\nprojection to E1u ; thus,\ns\n\nof W u (q) and\nperturb X so\nof W u (q) \u2229 \u03a3\nlet \u03a0u1 be the\n\n\u03a0u (y, u, v) = (0, u, v) and \u03a0u1 (y, u, v) = (0, u, 0).\nThe nontransversality of W u (q) and W s (p) at r means that\nL\u2032 = \u03a0u L 6= E u\n(see case (B1)). Applying a reasoning similar to that in case (B1), we perturb\nX so that if L\u2032\u2032 = L\u2032 \u2229 E1u , then\ndimL\u2032\u2032 < dimE1u = 2.\nHence, either dimL\u2032\u2032 = 1 or dimL\u2032\u2032 = 0. We consider only the first case, the\nsecond one is trivial.\nDenote by A the line L\u2032\u2032 . Images of A under degrees of \u03c3 (extended to\nthe whole plane E1u ) are m different lines in E1u .\nIn what follows, we refer to an obvious geometric statement (given without a proof).\nProposition 1.

For nonsingular\nflows, the latter inclusion implies that X is \u03a9-stable [14] (note that this is\nnot the case for flows with rest points [15]). Now, based on the second part\nof the proof of Theorem 1, one easily proves Theorem 3 following the same\nlines as in [4, Theorem 4].\n\n20\n\n\f3\n\nProof of Theorem 2\n\nConsider a vector field X \u2217 on the manifold M = S 2 \u00d7S 2 that has the following\nproperties (F1)-(F3) (\u03c6\u2217 denotes the flow generated by X \u2217 ).\n(F1) The nonwandering set of \u03c6\u2217 is the union of four rest points p\u2217 , q \u2217 , s\u2217 , u\u2217.\n(F2) For some \u03b4 > 0 we can introduce coordinates in the neighborhoods\nB(\u03b4, p\u2217 ) and B(\u03b4, q \u2217 ) such that\nX \u2217 (x) = Jp\u2217 (x\u2212p\u2217 ),\nwhere\n\nx \u2208 B(\u03b4, p\u2217 ),\n\nand X \u2217 (x) = Jq\u2217 (x\u2212q \u2217 ),\n\nx \u2208 B(\u03b4, q \u2217 ),\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22121 0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 \u22122 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\nJp\u2217 = \u2212Jq\u2217 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0\n0 1 \u22121 \uf8f8\n0\n0 1 1\n\uf8eb\n\n(F3) The point s\u2217 is an attracting hyperbolic rest point. The point u\u2217\nis a repelling hyperbolic rest point. The following condition holds:\nW u (p\u2217 ) \\ {p\u2217 } \u2282 W s (s\u2217 ),\n\nW s (q \u2217 ) \\ {q \u2217 } \u2282 W u (u\u2217 ).\n\n(32)\n\nThe intersection of W s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 W u (q \u2217 ) consists of a single trajectory \u03b1\u2217 ,\nand for any x \u2208 \u03b1\u2217 , the condition\ndim Tx W s (p\u2217 ) \u2295 Tx W u (q \u2217 ) = 3\n\n(33)\n\nholds.\nThese conditions imply that the two-dimensional manifolds W s (p\u2217 ) and\nW (q \u2217 ) intersect along a one-dimensional curve in the four-dimensional manifold M. Thus, W s (p\u2217 ) and W u (q \u2217 ) are not transverse; hence, X \u2217 \u2208 B.\nA construction of such a vector field is given in the Appendix.\nTo prove Theorem 2, we show that X \u2217 \u2208 Int1 (OrientSh).\nu\n\nThe vector field X \u2217 satisfies Axiom A and the no-cycle condition; hence,\nX \u2217 is \u03a9-stable. Thus, there exists a neighborhood V of X \u2217 in the C 1 -topology\nsuch that for any field X \u2208 V , its nonwandering set consists of four hyperbolic rest points p, q, s, u which belong to small neighborhoods of p\u2217 , q \u2217 , s\u2217 , u\u2217 ,\n21\n\n\frespectively. We denote by \u03c6 the flow of any X \u2208 V and by W s (p), W u (p)\netc the corresponding stable and unstable manifolds.\nNote that if the neighborhood V is small enough, then there exists a\nnumber c > 0 (the same for all X \u2208 V ) such that\nB(c, s\u2217 ) \u2282 W s (s) and B(c, u\u2217) \u2282 W u (u).\nConsider the set \u0398 = W u (p\u2217 ) \u2229 \u2202B(\u03b4, p\u2217 ) (where \u2202A is the boundary of a set\nA). Condition (32) implies that there exists a neighborhood U\u0398 of \u0398 and a\nnumber T > 0 such that\n\u03c6\u2217 (T, x) \u2208 B(c/2, s\u2217 ),\n\nx \u2208 U\u0398 .\n\nReducing V , if necessary, we may assume that\nW u (p) \u2229 \u2202B(\u03b4, p) \u2282 U\u0398\n\nand \u03c6(T, x) \u2208 B(c, s\u2217 ),\n\nx \u2208 U\u0398 .\n\nHence, W u (p) \\ {p} \u2282 W s (s), and\nW u (p) \u2229 W s (q) = \u2205.\n\n(34)\n\nSimilarly, we may assume that W s (q) \\ {q} \u2282 W u (u).\nThe following two cases are possible for X \u2208 V .\n(S1) W s (p) \u2229 W u (q) = \u2205.\n(S2) W s (p) \u2229 W u (q) 6= \u2205.\nIn case (S1), X is a Morse-Smale field; hence, X \u2208 S. Since S \u2282 StSh\n(see [13]), X \u2208 OrientSh.\nRemark 1. In fact, it is shown in [13] that if a vector field X \u2208 S does\nnot have closed trajectories (as in our case), then X has the Lipschitz shadowing property without reparametrization of shadowing trajectories: there\nexists L > 0 such that if g(t) is a d-pseudotrajectory with small d, then there\nexists a point x such that\ndist(g(t), \u03c6(t, x)) \u2264 Ld,\n\nt \u2208 R.\n\nWe refer to this fact below.\nThus, in the rest of the proof of Theorem 2, we consider case (S2). Our\ngoal is to show that if the neighborhood V is small enough, then X \u2208\nOrientSh.\n22\n\n\fLemma 4. If the neighborhood V is small enough, then the intersection\nW (p) \u2229 W u (q) consists of a single trajectory.\ns\n\nProof. Denote x\u2217p = \u03b1\u2217 \u2229 \u2202B(\u03b4, p\u2217 ) and x\u2217q = \u03b1\u2217 \u2229 \u2202B(\u03b4, q \u2217 ).\nConsider sections Qp and Qq transverse to \u03b1 at the points x\u2217p and x\u2217q ,\nrespectively, and the corresponding Poincar\u00e9 map F \u2217 : Qq \u2192 Qp . Consider\nthe curves \u03bep\u2217 = W s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 Qp \u2229 B(\u03b4/2, x\u2217p ) and \u03beq\u2217 = W s (q \u2217 ) \u2229 Qq \u2229 B(\u03b4/2, x\u2217q ).\nNote that \u03bep\u2217 and F \u2217 (\u03beq\u2217 ) intersect at a single point x\u2217p .\nLet \u03bep = W s (p) \u2229 Qp \u2229 B(\u03b4/2, x\u2217p ) and \u03beq = W u (q) \u2229 Qq \u2229 B(\u03b4/2, x\u2217q ). Let\nF be the Poincar\u00e9 transformation for X from Qq to Qp similar to F \u2217 .\nIf the neighborhood V is small enough, then the curves \u03bep , \u03beq , and F (\u03beq )\nare C1 -close to \u03bep\u2217 , \u03beq\u2217 , and F \u2217 (\u03beq\u2217 ), respectively (hence, the intersection of \u03bep\nand F (\u03beq ) contains not more than one point).\nThe same reasoning as in the proof of (34) shows that if the neighborhood\nV is small enough, x \u2208 W s (p)\\{p}, and the trajectory of x does not intersect\n\u03bep , then x \u2208 W u (u).\nThus, any trajectory in W s (p) \u2229 W u (q) must intersect \u03bep ; similarly, it\nmust intersect \u03beq as well as F (\u03beq ).\nIt follows that the intersection W s (p) \u2229 W u (q) (which is nonempty since\nwe consider case (S2)) consists of a single trajectory containing the unique\npoint xp of intersection of \u03bep and F (\u03beq ) (we denote this trajectory by \u03b1).\nThis completes the proof of Lemma 4.\nRemark 2. Let us note an important property of intersection of W s (p)\nand W u (q) along \u03b1 (see (36) below).\nLet xq = F \u22121 (xp ); denote by ip and iq unit tangent vectors to the curves\n\u03bep and \u03beq at xp and xq , respectively. Our reasoning above and condition (33)\nshow that if the neighborhood V is small enough, then the vectors ip and\nDF (xq )iq are not parallel:\nDF (xq )iq \u2226 ip .\n(35)\nTake any two points yp = \u03c6(t1 , xp ) and yq = \u03c6(t2 , xq ) with t1 \u2265 0, t2 \u2264 0;\nlet Sp and Sq be smooth transversals to \u03b1 at these points. Let ep and eq\nbe tangent vectors of Sp \u2229 W s (p) and Sq \u2229 W u (q) at yp and yq , respectively.\nDenote by f : Sq \u2192 Sp , Hp : Qp \u2192 Sp , and Hq : Sq \u2192 Qq the corresponding\nPoincar\u00e9 transformations for X. Then f = Hp \u25e6 F \u25e6 Hq ,\nep k DHp (xp )ip ,\n\nand eq k DHq\u22121(xq )iq .\n\nHence, Df (yq )eq k DHp \u25e6 DF (xq )iq , and it follows from (35) that\nDf (yq )eq \u2226 ep .\n23\n\n(36)\n\n\fNow it remains to show that if V is small enough and X \u2208 V , then\nX \u2208 OrientSh (recall that we consider case (S2)). This proof is rather\ncomplicated, and we first describe its scheme.\nWe fix two points yp , yq \u2208 \u03b1 in small neighborhoods Up and Uq of p and q,\nrespectively (the choice of Up and Uq is specified later). We consider special\npseudotrajectories (of type Ps): the \"middle\" part of such a pseudotrajectory\nis the part of \u03b1 between yq and yp , while its \"negative\" and \"positive\" tails\nare parts of trajectories that start near yq and yp , respectively. We show that\nour shadowing problem is reduced to shadowing of pseudotrajectories of type\nPs.\nThe key part of the proof is a statement \"on four balls.\" It is shown that\nif B1 , . . . , B4 are small balls such that B1 and B4 are centered at points of\nW s (q) and W u (p), while B2 and B3 are centered at yq and yp , respectively,\nthen there exists an exact trajectory that intersects B1 , . . . , B4 successfully\nas time grows. This statement (and its analog) allows us to prove that\npseudotrajectories of type Ps can be shadowed.\nLet us fix points yp , yq \u2208 \u03b1 (everywhere below, we assume that yp = \u03b1(Tp )\nand yq = \u03b1(Tq ) with Tp > Tq ) and a number \u03b4 > 0. We say that g(t) is a\npseudotrajectory of type Ps(\u03b4) if\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c6(t \u2212 Tp , xp ), t > Tp ,\n(37)\ng(t) = \u03c6(t \u2212 Tq , xq ), t < Tq ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b1(t),\nt \u2208 [Tq , Tp ],\nfor some points\n\nxp \u2208 B(\u03b4, yp ) and xq \u2208 B(\u03b4, yq ).\n\nFix an arbitrary \u03b5 > 0. We prove the following two statements (Propositions 2 and 3). In these statements, we say that a pseudotrajectory g(t) can\nbe \u03b5-shadowed if there exists a reparametrization h and a point p such that\n(2) holds.\nAn \u03a9-stable vector field has a continuous Lyapunov function that strictly\ndecreases along wandering trajectories (see [16]). Hence, there exist small\nneighborhoods Up and Uq of points p and q, respectively, such that\n\u03c6(t, x) \u2208\n/ Uq ,\n\nx \u2208 Up , t \u2265 0.\n\n(38)\n\nProposition 2. For any \u03b4 > 0, yp \u2208 \u03b1 \u2229 Up , and yq \u2208 \u03b1 \u2229 Uq there\nexists d > 0 such that if g(t) is a d-pseudotrajectory of X, then either g(t)\n24\n\n\fcan be \u03b5-shadowed or there exists a pseudotrajectory g \u2217(t) of type Ps(\u03b4) with\nthese yp and yq such that dist(g(t), g \u2217(t)) < \u03b5/2, t \u2208 R.\nProposition 3.\nThere exists \u03b4 > 0, yp \u2208 \u03b1 \u2229 Up , and yq \u2208 \u03b1 \u2229 Uq\nsuch that any pseudotrajectory of type Ps(\u03b4) with these yp and yq can be\n\u03b5/2-shadowed.\nClearly, Propositions 2 and 3 imply that X \u2208 OrientSh.\nTo prove Proposition 2, we need an auxiliary statement.\nLemma 5. For any x \u2208 \u03b1 and \u03b5, \u03b51 > 0 there exists d > 0 such that if\n{g(t) : t \u2208 R} \u2229 B(\u03b51 , x) = \u2205,\n\n(39)\n\nfor a d-pseudotrajectory g(t), then one can find x0 \u2208 M and h(t) \u2208 Rep such\nthat\ndist(g(t), \u03c6(h(t), x0 )) < \u03b5, t \u2208 R.\nProof. Take \u2206 < \u03b51 /2 such that if ap = \u03c6(1, x) and aq = \u03c6(\u22121, x),\nthen ap , aq \u2208\n/ B(\u2206, x). Let Sp and Sq be three-dimensional transversals to\n\u03b1 at ap and aq , respectively. Let f : Sq \u2192 Sp be the corresponding Poincar\u00e9\nmapping. Note that the intersections W u (q) \u2229 Sq and W s (p) \u2229 Sp near aq\nand ap are one-dimensional, hence the curves f (W u (q) \u2229 Sq ) and W s (p) \u2229 Sp\nin Sp are nontransverse.\nIt is shown in [17, 11] that there exists an arbitrarily small perturbation\nof the field X supported in B(\u2206, x) and such that the Poincar\u00e9 mapping\nf \u0303 : Sq \u2192 Sp of the perturbed field X\u0303 satisfies the condition\nf \u0303(W u (q) \u2229 Sq ) \u2229 (W s (p) \u2229 Sp ) = \u2205.\nSimilarly to case (S1), we conclude that we can find X\u0303 \u2208 S.\nSet \u03b52 = min(\u03b5, \u03b51/2) and find d > 0 such that any d-pseudotrajectory of\nthe field X\u0303 can be \u03b52 -shadowed. We assume, in addition, that\n\u2206 + d < \u03b51 .\n\n(40)\n\nConsider an arbitrary d-pseudotrajectory g(t) of X for which (39) holds. By\n(40), g(t) is a d-pseudotrajectory of the field X\u0303. Due to the choice of d, there\nexists x0 \u2208 M and h(t) \u2208 Rep such that\ndist(g(t), \u03c6\u0303(h(t), x0 )) < \u03b52 ,\n25\n\n\fwhere \u03c6\u0303 is the flow of X\u0303. Hence, {\u03c6\u0303(h(t), x0 ), t \u2208 R} \u2229 B(\u03b51 , x) = \u2205; it\nfollows that \u03c6\u0303(h(t), x0 ) = \u03c6(h(t), x0 ), which proves Lemma 5.\nProof of Proposition 2. Take \u03b4 > 0, yp \u2208 \u03b1 \u2229 Up , and yq \u2208 \u03b1 \u2229 Uq .\nLet yq = \u03b1(Tq ) and yp = \u03b1(Tp ). There exists \u03b41 \u2208 (0, min(\u03b4, \u03b5)) such that\nB(\u03b41 , yp ) \u2282 Up , B(\u03b41 , yq ) \u2282 Uq , and if xp \u2208 B(\u03b41 , yp ) and xq \u2208 B(\u03b41 , yq ), then\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c6(t \u2212 Tp , xp ), t > Tp ,\n\u2217\ng (t) = \u03b1(t),\n(41)\nt \u2208 [Tq , Tp ],\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c6(t \u2212 Tq , xq ), t < Tq ,\n\nis a pseudotrajectory of type Ps(\u03b4).\nTake x = \u03b1(T ), where T \u2208 (Tq , Tp ). Applying Lemma 5, we can find\n\u03b51 > 0 such that if d is small enough, then for any d-pseudotrajectory g(t),\none of the following two cases holds (after a shift of time):\n(A1)\n{g(t), t \u2208 R} \u2229 B(\u03b51 , x) = \u2205,\nand g(t) can be \u03b5-shadowed;\n(A2)\ng(Tp ) \u2208 B(\u03b41 /2, yp),\n\ng(Tq ) \u2208 B(\u03b41 /2, yq ),\n\nand\ndist(g(t), \u03b1(t)) < \u03b5/2,\n\nt \u2208 [Tq , Tp ].\n\nTo prove Proposition 2, it remains to consider case (A2).\nApply the same reasoning as in Lemma 5 to construct a field X\u0303 \u2208 S that\ncoincides with X outside B(\u03b41 /2, yq ); let \u03c6\u0303 be the flow of X\u0303.\nNote that X\u0303 does not have closed trajectories. Reducing d, if necessary,\nwe may assume that any d-pseudotrajectory of X\u0303 can be \u03b41 /2-shadowed in\nthe sense of Remark 1.\nConsider the mapping\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c6\u0303(t \u2212 Tp , g(Tp)), t < Tp ,\ng\u0303p (t) = g(t),\nt \u2208 [Tp , T ],\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c6\u0303(t \u2212 T, g(T )),\nt > T,\n\nwhere\n\nT = inf{t > Tp : g\u0303p (t) \u2208 B(\u03b41 , yq )}\n26\n\n\f(if {t > Tp : g\u0303p (t) \u2208 B(\u03b41 , yq )} = \u2205, we set T = +\u221e). Since\nB(\u03b41 /2, g(t)) \u2229 B(\u03b41 /2, yq ) = \u2205\nfor t \u2208 [Tp , T ), g\u0303p (t) is a d-pseudotrajectory of X\u0303. Hence, there exists a point\nxp such that\ndist(g\u0303p (t), \u03c6\u0303(t \u2212 Tp , xp )) < \u03b41 /2, t \u2208 R.\nThe first inclusion in (A2) implies that xp \u2208 B(\u03b4, yp ).\nSince trajectories of X and X\u0303 coincide outside B(\u03b41 /2, yq ), we deduce\nfrom (38) that T = +\u221e; hence,\ndist(g(t), \u03c6(t \u2212 Tp , xp )) < \u03b41 /2,\n\nt \u2265 Tp .\n\nSimilarly (reducing d, if necessary), we find xq \u2208 B(\u03b4, yq ) such that\ndist(g(t), \u03c6(t \u2212 Tq , xq )) < \u03b41 /2,\n\nt \u2264 Tq .\n\nClearly, the mapping (41) is a pseudotrajectory of type Ps(\u03b4) such that\ndist(g(t), g \u2217(t)) < \u03b5/2,\n\nt \u2208 R.\n\nThis completes the proof of Proposition 2.\nIn the remaining part of the paper, we prove Proposition 3. Let us recall\nthat we consider a vector field X in a small neighborhood V of X \u2217 for which\nW s (p) \u2229 W u (q) 6= \u2205.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that\nO + (B(\u03b5/2, s), \u03c6) \u2282 B(\u03b5, s) and O \u2212 (B(\u03b5/2, u), \u03c6) \u2282 B(\u03b5, u).\nTake m \u2208 (0, \u03b5/8) such that B(m, p) \u2282 Up , B(m, q) \u2282 Uq and the flow of\nthe vector field X in the neighborhoods B(2m, p) and B(2m, q) is conjugate\nby a homeomorphism to the flow of a linear vector field.\nWe take points yp = \u03b1(Tp ) \u2208 B(m/2, p)\u2229\u03b1 and yq = \u03b1(Tq ) \u2208 B(m/2, q)\u2229\n\u03b1. Then O + (yp , \u03c6) \u2282 B(m, p) and O \u2212 (yq , \u03c6) \u2282 B(m, q). Take \u03b4 > 0 such\nthat if g(t) is a pseudotrajectory of type Ps(\u03b4) (with yp and yq fixed above),\nt0 \u2208 R, and x0 \u2208 B(2\u03b4, g(t0 )), then\ndist(\u03c6(t \u2212 t0 , x0 ), g(t)) < \u03b5/2,\nwhere T = Tp \u2212 Tq .\n27\n\n|t \u2212 t0 | \u2264 T + 1,\n\n(42)\n\n\fConsider a number \u03c4 > 0 such that if x \u2208 W u (p) \\ B(m/2, p), then\n\u03c6(\u03c4, x) \u2208 B(\u03b5/8, s). Take \u03b51 \u2208 (0, m/4) such that if two points z1 , z2 \u2208 M\nsatisfy the inequality dist(z1 , z2 ) < \u03b51 , then\ndist(\u03c6(t, z1 ), \u03c6(t, z2 )) < \u03b5/8,\n\n|t| \u2264 \u03c4.\n\nIn this case, for any y \u2208 B(\u03b51 , x) (recall that we consider x \u2208 W u (p) \\\nB(m/2, p)), the following inequalities hold:\ndist(\u03c6(t, x), \u03c6(t, y)) < \u03b5/4,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(43)\n\nReducing \u03b51 , if necessary, we may assume that if x\u2032 \u2208 W s (q) \\ B(m/2, q) and\ny \u2032 \u2208 B(\u03b51 , x\u2032 ), then\ndist(\u03c6(t, x\u2032 ), \u03c6(t, y \u2032)) < \u03b5/4,\n\nt \u2264 0.\n\nLet g(t) be a pseudotrajectory of type Ps(\u03b4), where \u03b4, yp , and yq satisfy\nthe above-formulated conditions. We claim that if \u03b4 is small enough, then g(t)\ncan be \u03b5/2-shadowed (in fact, we have to reduce \u03b4 and to impose additional\nu\nconditions on yp and yq ). Below we denote Wloc\n(p, m) = W u (p) \u2229 B(m, p)\netc.\nAdditionally decreasing \u03b4, we may assume that for any points zp \u2208\nu\nWloc (p, m), x0 \u2208 B(\u03b4, yp ), and s > 0 such that \u03c6(s, x0 ) \u2208 B(\u03b4, zp ), the following inclusions hold:\n\u03c6(t, x0 ) \u2208 B(2m, p),\n\nt \u2208 [0, s].\n\n(44)\n\nLet us consider several possible cases.\nCase (P1): xp \u2208\n/ W s (p) and xq \u2208\n/ W u (q).

If t \u2208\n[Tq , Tp ], then inequality (47) follows from (46). This completes the proof in\ncase (P1).\nCase (P2): xp \u2208 W s (p) and xq \u2208\n/ W u (q). In this case, Lemma 6 is\nreplaced by the following statement.\nLemma 7. There exists m > 0 such that for any points\nyp \u2208 B(m, p) \u2229 \u03b1,\n\nyq \u2208 B(m, q) \u2229 \u03b1,\n\ns\nzq \u2208 Wloc\n(q, m) \\ {q},\n\nand a number m1 > 0 there exists a trajectory of the vector field X that inters\nsects successively the balls B(m1 , zq ), B(m1 , yq ), and B(m1 , yp ) \u2229 Wloc\n(p, m)\nas time grows.\nThe rest of the proof uses the same reasoning as in case (P1).\nCase (P3): xp \u2208\n/ W s (p) and xq \u2208 W u (q). This case is similar to case (P2).\nCase (P4): xp \u2208 W s (p) and xq \u2208 W u (q). In this case, we take \u03b1 as the\nshadowing trajectory; the reparametrization is constructed similarly to case\n(P1).\nThus, to complete the consideration of case (S2), it remains to prove\nLemmas 6 and 7.\nTo prove Lemma 6, we first fix proper coordinates in small neighborhoods\nof the points p and q. Let us begin with the case of the point p.\nTaking a small neighborhood V of the vector field X \u2217 , we may assume\nthat the Jacobi matrix Jp = DX(p) is as close to Jp\u2217 as we want.\nThus, we assume that p = 0 in coordinates u1 = (x1 , x2 ), u2 = (x3 , x4 ),\nand Jp = diag(Ap , Bp ), where\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212\u03bb1\n0\nap \u2212bp\nAp =\n, Bp =\n,\n(48)\n0 \u2212\u03bb2\nbp ap\nand\n\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , ap , bp > 4g,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere g is a small positive number to be chosen later (and a similar notation\nis used in Uq ).\n30\n\n\fThen we can represent the field X in a small neighborhood U of the point\np in the form\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nX12 (u1 , u2 )\nu1\nAp 0\n,\n(50)\n+\nX(u1 , u2 ) =\nX34 (u1 , u2 )\nu2\n0 Bp\nwhere\nX12 , X34 \u2208 C1 , |X12 |\n\nC1\n\n, |X34 |\n\nC1\n\n< g, X12 (0, 0) = X34 (0, 0) = (0, 0). (51)\n\nUnder these assumptions, p = 0 is a hyperbolic rest point whose twodimensional unstable manifold in the neighborhood U is given by u2 = G(u1 ),\nwhere G : R2 \u2192 R2 , G \u2208 C1 . We can find g > 0 such that if the functions\nX12 and X34 satisfy relations (51), then\nkDG(u1)k < 1 while (u1 , G(u1 )) \u2208 U.\n\n(52)\n\nWe introduce new coordinates in U by v(u1 , u2) = (u1 , u2 \u2212 G(u1 )) and use a\nsmooth cut-off function to extend v to a C1 diffeomorphism w of M such that\nw(x) = x outside a larger neighborhood U \u2032 of p. Denote by Y the resulting\nvector field in the new coordinates.\nRemark 3. Note that Y is continuous but not necessary C1 . Nevertheless, the following holds. Let S1 and S2 be small smooth three-dimensional\ndisks transverse to a trajectory of Y and let fY be the corresponding Poincar\u00e9\ntransformation generated by the vector field Y . Consider smooth disks\nw \u22121 (S1 ) and w \u22121(S2 ) and let fX : w \u22121 (S1 ) \u2192 w \u22121 (S2 ) be the corresponding\nPoincar\u00e9 transformation. Since fX \u2208 C1 and fY = w \u25e6 fX \u25e6 w \u22121, we conclude\nthat fY \u2208 C1 . We will use this fact below.\nIf (v1 , v2 ) = v(u1, u2 ), then\nu1 = v1 ,\n\nu2 = v2 + G(v1 ).\n\n(53)\n\nLet Y (v1 , v2 ) = (Y1 (v1 , v2 ), Y2 (v1 , v2 )). Since the surface u2 = G(u1 ) is a local\nstable manifold of the rest point 0 of the field X, the surface v2 = 0 is a local\nstable manifold of the rest point 0 of the vector field Y .

Hence,\ndim(T(0,0,0,0) l \u2295 T(0,0,0,0) f (l)) = 2.\n\n(69)\n\nDefine a vector field X \u2212 on M1\u2212 \u00d7 M2 by the formula\nX \u2212 (x) = \u2212 D f (f \u22121 (x))X + (f \u22121 (x))\n(and note that x(t) is a trajectory of X + if and only if f (x(\u2212t)) is a trajectory\nof X \u2212 ).\nFinally, we define the following vector field X \u2217 on M1 \u00d7 M2 :\n(\nX + (x),\nx \u2208 M1+ \u00d7 M2 ,\n\u2217\nX (x) =\nX \u2212 (x),\nx \u2208 M1\u2212 \u00d7 M2\nLet us check that the vector field X \u2217 is well-defined on the set {r1 = 0}.\nIndeed, X + (0, \u03c61, r2 , \u03c62 ) = (1, 0, 0, 0) and (D f (0, \u03c61 , r2 , \u03c62 ))\u22121 (1, 0, 0, 0) =\n(\u22121, 0, 0, 0). It is easy to see that D X + (0, \u03c61 , r2 , \u03c62 ) = D X \u2212 (0, \u03c61 , r2 , \u03c62 ) =\n0. This implies that X \u2208 C1 .\nLet us prove that the vector field X \u2217 satisfies conditions (F1) \u2013 (F3). Let\n(r1 (t), \u03c61 (t), r2 (t), \u03c62 (t)) be a trajectory of X \u2217 . The following inequalities\nhold:\nd\nr > 0, r1 6= \u00b11.\n(70)\ndt 1\nThis implies the inclusion \u03a9(X \u2217 ) \u2282 {r1 = \u00b11}. By the construction of X + ,\n\u03a9(X \u2217 ) \u2229 {r1 = 1} = {(1, *, s2), (1, *, u2)}. Similarly, \u03a9(X \u2217 ) \u2229 {r1 = \u22121} =\n{f (1, *, s2), f (1, *, u2)}. Denote s\u2217 = (1, *, s2), p\u2217 = (1, *, u2), q \u2217 = f (p),\nand u\u2217 = f (s). Clearly, s\u2217 , u\u2217 , p\u2217 , q \u2217 are hyperbolic rest points, s\u2217 is an\nattractor, u\u2217 is a repeller, D X(p\u2217 ) = Jp\u2217 , and D X(q \u2217 ) = Jq\u2217 . In addition, in\nsmall neighborhoods of p\u2217 and q \u2217 , the vector field X \u2217 is linear.\nIt is easy to see that\nW s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 {r1 = 1} = {p\u2217 } and W s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 {r1 = \u22121} = \u2205.\nInequality (70) implies that any trajectory in W s (p\u2217 ) \\ {p\u2217 } intersects the set\n{r1 = 0} at a single point. The definition of X + implies that W s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 {r1 =\n40\n\n\f0} = l. Similarly, any trajectory in W u (q \u2217 ) \\ {q \u2217 } intersects {r1 = 0} at a\nsingle point, and W u (q \u2217 ) \u2229{r1 = 0} = f (l). It follows from equality (68) that\nW s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 {r1 = 0} \u2229 W u (q \u2217 ) is a single point, and hence W s (p\u2217 ) \u2229 W u (q \u2217 )\nconsists of a single trajectory.\nInequality (70) implies condition (32), and condition (69) implies (33).\nThe authors are deeply grateful to the anonymous referee whose remarks\nhelped us to significantly improve the presentation.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
