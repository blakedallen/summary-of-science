[2] in analogy with Coulomb blockade for electrons\n[3, 4, 5], occurs when the absorption of a first input photon by an optical device blocks the transmission of a second\none, thereby leading to nonclassical output photon statistics. Photon blockade has been predicted in many different\nsettings [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], including for a single two-level atom in cavity QED [9, 12, 13, 14]. In the latter setting,\nthe blockade is due to the anharmonicity of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of eigenstates [15]. If an incoming photon\nresonantly excites the atom-cavity system from its ground state to |1, \u00b1i (where |n, +(\u2212)i denotes the n-excitation\ndressed state with higher (lower) energy), then a second photon at the same frequency will be detuned from either\nof the next steps up the ladder, i.e. from states |2, \u00b1i. In the strong coupling regime [16], for which the coherent\nrate of evolution g0 exceeds the dissipative rates \u03ba and \u03b3, this detuning will be much larger than the excited-state\nline widths, so that the two-excitation manifold will rarely be populated. This in turn leads to the ordered flow of\nphotons in the transmitted field, which emerge from the cavity one at a time.\nWe recently reported observations of photon blockade in the light transmitted by an optical cavity containing one\natom strongly coupled to the cavity field [1]. For coherent excitation at the cavity input, the photon statistics for the\ncavity output displayed both photon antibunching and sub-Poissonian photon statistics. However, as illustrated in\nFig. 1, the multiplicity of atomic and cavity states makes our experiment considerably more complex than the simple\nsituation described by the extended Jaynes-Cummings model with damping [9, 12, 13, 14]. In our paper [1] and the\naccompanying Supplemental Information [17], we presented theoretical results from an extended model that described\na multistate atom coupled to two cavity modes. The relevant atomic states are the Zeeman states of a particular\nhyperfine transition in atomic Cesium, namely 6S1/2 , F = 4 \u2194 6P3/2 , F \u2032 = 5\u2032 at 852 nm. The relevant modes of the\nFabry-Perot cavity are two TEM00 modes of the same longitudinal order but orthogonal polarizations.\nOur purpose in this paper is to provide a more complete discussion of photon blockade than in Ref. [1], both by way\nof particular results from our model calculation and of a general framework for characterization of photon blockade,\nwith which we begin in Section II. In Section III we turn to the details of our actual system and calculate the eigenvalue\nstructure for a two-mode cavity coupled to an atom with multiple internal states. Here, we make explicit the coupling\nin the model Hamiltonian which is used to determine the eigenvalues displayed in Figure 1(b) of Ref. [1]. We also\nincorporate this Hamiltonian into the master equation for the damped, driven system used to compute theoretical\nresults for transmission spectra and photon statistics, as in Figure 2(b) of Ref. [1]. In Section IV, we gain some\nperspective on the relevant physical mechanisms by comparing transmission spectra and photon statistics for the\ncase of an external drive that excites the atom (rather than the cavity, as in our experiment). Section V presents\nan extension to our atom-cavity model which includes the effect of cavity birefringence and FORT-induced ac-Stark\nshifts in the atomic states. The modified cavity transmission and intensity correlation functions are presented for\ncomparison to previous results. We also display a theoretical result for the time dependence of the intensity correlation\nfunction for comparison to our measured result in Ref. [1]. Finally, in Section VI we offer a discussion of these various\nresults.\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\ny\nEp\n\nz\n\nD1\nM1\n\nM2\n\nz\n\ny\nx\n\nEt\n\nD2\nBS\n\nPBS\n\n(b)\nF \u2032 = 5\u2032\nF =4\n\n\u1e91[\u03c0]\n\nF \u2032 = 5\u2032\nF =4\n\n\u0177[\u03c3+ + \u03c3\u2212 ]\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nmF\nFIG. 1: (a) Diagram of the experiment of Ref.

Consider the following input\nelectromagnetic field state to some \"black box\",\nX\n|\u03c8in i =\nan |ni .\n(1)\nAssume that the mapping of input to output by the black box is given by the transmission coefficients tn for each\nFock-state |ni. The output state is then of the form\nX\n|\u03c8out i =\ntn an |ni .\n(2)\n\u221a\nFor a coherent-state input |\u03b1i, an \u221d \u03b1n / n!, so that\n\n|\u03c8out i \u221d\n\nX\n\n\u221a\ntn \u03b1n / n!|ni .\n\nA linear transfer function for the black box would be of the form tn \u223c (t1 )n , so that\nX\n\u221a\n|\u03c8out i \u221d\n(t1 \u03b1)n / n!|ni\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n\u221d |t1 \u03b1i .\nBy contrast, a nonlinear device can modify the photon statistics in a fashion other than |tn | \u223c |t1 |n . The working\ncriterion that we adopt here for photon blockade is that the transmission coefficients |tn | < |t1 |n for n \u2265 2. For\nexample, an \"ideal\" photon blockade device that eliminates all Fock states with n \u2265 2 (tn = 0 for n \u2265 2) would lead\nto the following output for a coherent state input:\n|\u03c8out i \u221d |0i + t1 \u03b1|1i .\n\n(5)\n\nLikewise, a device that produces photon pairs in abundance (and an associated large degree of photon bunching)\ncould be specified by |tn=2 | \u226b |t1 |2 , with all tn>2 = 0.\n\n\f3\nk\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n(n)\n\nTABLE I: Numerical factors \u03b5k\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b5k\n\u03b7k\n0\n7\n0.667 1\n0.683 2\n0.730 2\n0.803 2\n0.894 2\n1\n2\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b5k\n\u03b7k\n0\n5\n0.516 1\n0.556 2\n0.662 2\n0.805 2\n0.966 3\n0.978 2\n1.014 2\n1.073 2\n1.155 2\n1.265 2\n1.414 2\n\n(n)\n\nfor the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H4\u21925\u2032 in Eq. (7), together with their degeneracies \u03b7k .\n\nOf course, even in this simple setting of in \u2192 out, the above discussion is incomplete since at least one additional\ninput and output channel is required to preserve unitarity. More generally, the transformation in \u2192 out requires\nmultiple input and output channels (e.g., polarizations for the input and output fields with a continuum of frequencies,\nrelevant quantum degrees of freedom for the material system of the black box, etc.). These additional channels\nmay affect the coherence of the output field, as discussed below in Section VI. Within this more complex setting,\nhowever, the conceptual framework that we suggest for identifying photon blockade still rests upon the simple intuition\ndescribed above. Namely, one of the output channels should have the property that the transmission coefficients tn\nsatisfy tn < |t1 |n for n \u2265 2.\nNote that the pioneering work on photon blockade based upon EIT satisfies the above criterion [2, 6, 7, 8, 9], as\ndoes resonance fluorescence from a single atom [18] and the cavity QED schemes considered in Refs. [9, 12, 13, 14].\nIndeed, by the criterion stated above, most single atomic or molecular emitters function by way of photon blockade.\nThe problem of course is that the efficiency for collecting fluorescence is typically poor. So, in addition to the more\nfundamental requirement tn < |t1 |n , it seems reasonable to add a second, more practical criterion related to efficiency.\nPhoton blockade is of much less practical significance if the efficiency for the mapping of input to an output channel is\nnegligibly small, but precisely \"how small is too small\" is hard to quantify and depends upon the particular application.\nMuch of the effort related to photon blockade is directed towards maintaining the \"quality\" of blockade inherent in\nsingle-atom resonance fluorescence while at the same time achieving a sensibly large efficiency, which has led our\ngroup to employ an optical cavity within the setting of cavity QED, a system to which we now turn our attention.\nIII.\n\nEIGENVALUES OF THE ATOM-CAVITY SYSTEM\n\nWe begin this section, adapted from Ref.

We consider an F =\n4 \u2192 F \u2032 = 5\u2032 transition driven by linearly polarized light in a cavity containing two modes of orthogonal polarization that\nare frequency-degenerate. Parameters are (g0 , \u03ba, \u03b3)/2\u03c0 = (50, 1, 1) MHz. The probe strength is such that the intracavity\nphoton number on resonance without an atom is 0.05. The blue dotted line indicates g (2) (0) = 1 for Poissonian statistics. (b)\nDiagram of the eigenvalue structure from Table I. Red and blue arrows denote probe frequencies indicated in (a) which lead\nto sub-Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics, respectively.\n\nwhere \u03c9A is the atomic transition frequency, \u03c9C1 is the cavity resonance frequency, and Dy = \u221ai2 (D\u22121 + D+1 ) is the\ndipole operator for linear polarization along the y-axis. We are using coordinates where the cavity supports \u0177 and \u1e91\npolarizations and x\u0302 is along the cavity axis. The annihilation operator for the \u1e91 (\u0177) polarized cavity mode is a (b).\nAssuming \u03c9A = \u03c9C1 \u2261 \u03c90 , we find that the lowest eigenvalues of H4\u21925\u2032 have a relatively simple structure. In the\nmanifold of zero excitations, all nine eigenvalues are zero. In manifolds with n excitations, the eigenvalues are of the\n(n)\n(n)\nform En,k = n~\u03c90 + ~g0 \u03b5k , where \u03b5k is a numerical factor and k is an index for distinct eigenvalues. There are\n29 states in the n = 1 manifold, but due to degeneracy k has only 13 distinct values, k \u2208 {\u22126, . . . 6}; in the n = 2\nmanifold there are 49 states but k \u2208 {\u221211, . . . 11}. The total number of states in any manifold can be understood by\nconsidering how the excitations can be distributed among the atom and the two cavity modes. For example, in the\nn = 1 manifold, the atom can be in one of its 9 ground states (mF \u2208 {\u22124, . . . 4}) and either cavity mode ly or mode lz\ncan have one photon (giving 18 possible states), or the atom can be in one of its 11 excited states (m\u2032F \u2208 {\u22125, . . . 5})\nwhile both cavity modes are in the vacuum state, yielding a total of 29 states. Table I lists numerical values for\n(1,2)\n(1,2)\n\u03b5k\nas well as their respective degeneracies \u03b7k . The numerical factors and degeneracies have the symmetries\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n\u03b5\u2212k = \u2212\u03b5k and \u03b7\u2212k = \u03b7k . The resulting eigenvalues En,k for n = {0, 1, 2} are displayed in Fig. 2(b).\nAlthough these eigenvalues are certainly not sufficient for understanding the complex dynamics associated with\nthe full master equation, they do provide some insight into some structural aspects of the atom-cavity system. For\n(1)\nexample, the eigenvalues \u03b5\u00b16 = \u00b11 correspond to the vacuum-Rabi splitting for the states |1, \u00b1i for a two-state\natom coupled to a single cavity mode [cf., Fig. 1(a) of Ref. [1]]. The one-photon detunings for transitions from the\n(1)\nn = 1 \u2192 n\u2032 = 2 manifold are largest for the eigenstates associated with \u03b5\u00b16 . Indeed, just as for the two-state atom\n\u221a\nwith one cavity mode, transitions from the eigenstates at \u00b1g0 have frequency detunings \u00b1(2 \u2212 2)g0 relative to the\n\u221a\n(2)\nnearest states in the n\u2032 = 2 manifold (at \u03b5\u00b111 = \u00b1 2, respectively). Hence, as a function of probe frequency \u03c9p ,\nthe eigenvalue structure in Table I suggests that the ratio of two-photon to one-photon excitation would exhibit a\nminimum around \u03c9p = \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 , resulting in reduced values g (2) (0) < 1 [19], which the full calculation verifies in\nFig. 2(b) of Ref. [1].\nFor excitation to the other eigenstates in the n = 1 manifold, such blockade is not evidenced in Fig. 2(b) of Ref. [1].\nA contributing factor suggested by the structure of eigenvalues in Table I is interference of one and two-photon\nexcitation processes. For example, excitation at \u03c9p \u2243 \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 /4 results in two-photon resonance for the eigenstates\n\n\f5\n\n7\n\n10\n\ndrive\ncavity\n\n(b)\n\ndrive\natom\n\n3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\nT\u0303\n\nT\n\n10\n\ng\u0303 (2) (0)\n\ng (2) (0)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n(\u03c9p \u2212 \u03c90 )/g0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n(\u03c9p \u2212 \u03c90 )/g0\n\nFIG. 3: Spectra and intensity correlation functions for the Jaynes-Cummings system when (a) driving the cavity T and g (2) (0)\nor (b) driving the atom g\u0303 (2) (0) and T\u0303 versus normalized probe detuning. Parameters are (g0 , \u03ba, \u03b3)/2\u03c0 = (50, 1, 1) MHz. The\nprobe strength is such that the intracavity photon number on resonance without an atom is 0.05 for (a), and the atomic excited\nstate population on resonance without a cavity is 0.046 (s/2 = 0.05) for (b).

Here, we calculate transmission spectra and intensity\ncorrelation functions analogous to those shown in Figure 2(b) of Ref. [1], but now with coherent coupling g0 much\nlarger than the dissipative rates (\u03ba, \u03b3) and well beyond what we have achieved in our experiments, g0 /\u03ba = g0 /\u03b3 = 50\n(2)\n[20]. At \u03c9p = \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 , gyz (0) \u2243 0.002 in evidence of the previously discussed photon blockade suggested by the\neigenvalue structure in Table I. As anticipated, large photon bunching results near \u03c9p \u2243 \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 /4 associated with the\n(2)\ntwo-photon resonance to reach the eigenstates with \u03b5\u00b11 \u2243 \u00b10.5. Between these two extremes for the eigenvalues with\n(2)\nthe largest and smallest nonzero magnitudes (g0 /4 \u2264 |\u03c9p \u2212 \u03c90 | \u2264 g0 ), gyz (0) displays a complex structure involving\nmultiple excitation pathways through states in the n = 1 manifold to reach states in the n\u2032 = 2 manifold. The\nextremely large peak at \u03c9p = \u03c90 is discussed in Refs. [13, 21]. Similar calculations show that the photon blockade\neffect described by Fig. 2 is unaffected in its qualitative character if the atomic spontaneous decay rate \u03b3 is made\nmuch smaller than the cavity decay rate \u03ba, although we have not set \u03b3 strictly to zero.\nIV.\n\nDRIVEN ATOM\n\nFig. 2(b) of Ref. [1] compares the predicted photon statistics when driving the detected cavity mode (\u1e91) with the\nstatistics when driving the other cavity mode (\u0177). The driven cavity mode has photon statistics which are less strongly\nsub-Poissonian, an effect we hypothesize to be caused by interference between the atomic dipole radiation and the\ncoherent drive. We will now further explore this hypothesis by considering atom-cavity systems where the driving\nfield is directly coupled to the atom, instead of the cavity mode.\nWe first study the familiar Jaynes-Cummings system, a two-state atom coupled to a single mode cavity. We assume\na coherent drive field made of many photons which we will treat classically. In Fig. 3, we compare the intracavity\nfields [22] when driving (a) the cavity and (b) the atom for g0 /\u03ba = g0 /\u03b3 = 50. T, T\u0303 are proportional to the intracavity\nphoton number, with T normalized to the empty-cavity on-resonance photon number for the driven cavity and T\u0303\nnormalized to half of the saturation parameter s for the driven atom.

At \u03c9p = \u03c90 we\nhave g\u0303 (2) (0) \u2243 1.\nWe next consider a two-mode cavity coupled to the Zeeman states of the F = 4 \u2192 F \u2032 = 5\u2032 transition of a single atom,\nas in Section III. We take the probe field driving the atom to be polarized along \u1e91 and calculate the intracavity photon\nnumber T\u0303zz , T\u0303yz in the \u1e91, \u0177 modes, respectively (normalized to the drive strength as above), and the corresponding\n(2)\n(2)\nintensity correlation functions g\u0303zz (0), g\u0303yz (0).

This supports our hypothesis that the\n(2)\nsomewhat higher value of gzz (0) at \u03c9p = \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 is caused by interference with the drive field. Interestingly, though\n(2)\nthe central peak at \u03c9p = \u03c90 is absent in g\u0303zz (0), as we expect in correspondence with the Jaynes-Cummings case and\nas implied by the usual explanation of the phenomenon as resulting from the interference of the drive field with the\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\natomic dipole radiation, the peak in g\u0303yz (0) is even greater than that of gzz (0), gyz (0).

We consider an F = 4 \u2192 F \u2032 = 5\u2032\ntransition (with FORT induced ac-Stark shifts) in a cavity (containing two nondegenerate modes of orthogonal polarization)\ndriven by linearly polarized light. Parameters are (g0 , \u03ba, \u03b3, \u2206\u03c9C1 , U0 )/2\u03c0 = (33.9, 4.1, 2.6, 4.4, \u221243) MHz, and \u03c9C1z = \u03c9A \u2261 \u03c90 .\nThe probe strength is such that the intracavity photon number on resonance without an atom is 0.05.

The atomic excited state frequencies are given by \u03c9m\u2032F = \u03c9A +U0 \u03b2m\u2032F , where \u03c9A is the unshifted frequency\nof the F = 4 \u2192 F \u2032 = 5\u2032 transition in free space, U0 is the FORT potential, and \u03b2m\u2032F for the FORT wavelength of the\nexperiment is given by {m\u2032F , \u03b2m\u2032F } = {\u00b15, 0.18}, {\u00b14, 0.06}, {\u00b13, \u22120.03}, {\u00b12, \u22120.10}, {\u00b11, \u22120.14}, {0, \u22120.15} [23].\nThe effect of these corrections to the Hamiltonian on the transmitted field from the steady-state solutions to the\nmaster equation are displayed in Fig. 5, with the parameters corresponding to the experimental values from Ref. [1].\nThe heights and shapes of the multiplets in Tyz,zz are modified, but the basic structure is unaffected relative to\n(2)\nFig. 2(b) of Ref. [1]. The structure of gyz,zz (0) is also qualitatively unchanged. The asymmetry of the plots about \u03c90\n(2)\nis caused by the effective atom-cavity detuning (mostly due to the ac-Stark shifts). The value of gyz (0) for \u03c9p = \u03c90 \u2212g0\n(2)\nis 0.02 (ignoring the above corrections yields gyz (0) \u2243 0.03).

The probe strength is such that the resonant\nintracavity photon number of the bare cavity would be 0.21 as in the experiment of Ref. [1]. The blue dotted line indicates\ng (2) (0) = 1 for Poissonian statistics. This calculation was performed with a Fock basis of {0, 1, 2} photons in the \u1e91 polarized\nmode and {0, 1} photons in the \u0177 polarized mode.\n(2)\n\nof Ref. [1], gyz (0) = 0.13 \u00b1 0.11. Note that we have previously reported measurements of Tzz and made detailed\ncomparisons with the theory described here [24].\n(2)\nIn Fig. 6, we present the theoretical prediction for gyz (\u03c4 ) including the effects of Stark shifts and birefringence. We\n(2)\nfind that gyz (\u03c4 ) rises to unity at \u03c4 \u2243 80 ns, well above the experimental result of \u03c4 \u2243 45 ns. The theory, however,\ndoes not take into account atomic motion, but rather assumes the atom to be fixed at a place of optimal coupling.\n(2)\nSince atomic motion clearly has a large effect on gyz (\u03c4 ), as is evident in Fig. 4(b) of Ref. [1], we believe that this is\nthe dominant cause of the discrepancy [25].\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFrom the point of view described in general terms in Section II and elaborated in more detail in Sections III-V,\nour work in Ref. [1] satisfies the criteria for photon blockade. As indicated by Fig. 1(a,b) of Ref. [1], the JaynesCummings ladder provides a means to achieve the condition t2 < |t1 |2 , with the consequence that the intensity\ncorrelation function g (2) (0) < 1 as presented in Fig. 2 of Ref. [1] and in the previous sections. Note also that by\ntuning to a two-photon resonance, our calculations indicate that photon bunching g (2) (0) \u226b 1 could be achieved\nfor our atom-cavity system with (\u03c9p \u2243 \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 /4), again in accord with an understanding based upon transmission\ncoefficients tn . Photon bunching for the standard Jaynes-Cummings\nladder of Fig. 1(a) in Ref. [1] is likewise achieved\n\u221a\nby tuning to the two-photon resonance at \u03c9p \u2243 \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 / 2.\nOur criteria for photon blockade do not demand the preservation of coherence in the transformation from input to\noutput. One way to express a requirement for coherence in terms of the generic model in Section II is that the output\nstate should be of the form of Eq. (5), and not of the form\n\u03c1out \u223c |0ih0| + |t1 \u03b1|2 |1ih1| ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith the coherent amplitude lost. However, our view is that either Eq (5) or Eq. (9) suffices and qualifies as photon\nblockade. In fact, in practice the latter case of Eq. (9) might be the more \"useful\" for the following reasons.\nWith reference to Fig. 8 in Ref. [9], note that there are various contributions to g (2) (0) as a function of the amplitude\nof the driving field [Eq. (11b) of Ref. [9]]. The authors point out that \"The decomposition shows how the behavior\nof g (2) (0) . . . can be interpreted as the effect of self-homodyning between the coherent and incoherent components of\nthe intracavity field.\" For our initial experiments with relatively modest ratios g/(\u03ba, \u03b3), our view is that this complex,\nphase-dependent interplay should be avoided since it makes the blockade effect more \"fragile\" (less robust) than is the\n\n\f9\ncase for Eq. (9). Basically, one wants a situation where there is no need to balance a set of interference terms (as in\nEq. (11b) of Ref. [9]), but rather a more \"generic\" requirement of the sort presented in Section II, namely |tn | < |t1 |n .\nNote that an interpretation of photon antibunching similar to that expressed in Ref. [9] can be given for single-atom\nresonance fluorescence, as was first analyzed by Carmichael [22]. However, in this case the \"miracle\" is that the terms\nalways sum to give g (2) (0) = 0 for any drive strength, which is not the case for an atom in a cavity [22].\nOur calculations show that the mean value for the amplitude of the transmitted field with polarization orthogonal\nto that of the coherent state input is zero. So, there is not a sense in which the coherent amplitude of the input is\nrotated in polarization by the atom-cavity system in the transformation to the output. Nevertheless, the orthogonally\n(2)\npolarized output field can exhibit quantum interference, with an example being the value gyz (0) \u226b 1 for \u03c9p = \u03c90 in\nFigs. 2, 5, which is presumably associated with the quantum state reduction and interference described by Carmichael\n(2)\n(2)\nand coworkers [13, 21], with here gyz (0) \u2243 gzz (0) for \u03c9p = \u03c90 .\nFor our experiment with multiple Zeeman states in the ground and excited levels and with two orthogonally\npolarized cavity modes (y, z), the eigenstates that are being driven for excitation along y with \u03c9p = \u03c90 \u00b1 g0 are\ncomplex superpositions of various atomic Zeeman states and field states for the (y, z) polarizations. These eigenstates\nare entangled, so it is perhaps not surprising that examination of a particular component (e.g., for the field or atomic\ncoherences) results in a mixed state with mean zero. Hence, many coherences for a single degree of freedom may\nvanish not because of dissipation per se, but rather because of entanglement with other components. Although we\nhave not explored this question in detail, we think that this may explain why the mean amplitude for the transmitted\nz field is zero for excitation along y, as is the case for our results in Figs. 2, 5.\nA final perspective to offer is to extend the discussion from the case with continuous excitation as has been implicit\nabove to the case of pulsed excitation, as in Fig. 4 of Ref. [2]. Assume a pulse with duration short compared to any\ntime scale associated with the \"black box\" described in Section II. For resonance fluorescence, consider a \u03c0 pulse with\nduration \u03c4p \u226a \u03b3 \u22121 , so that there is now no coherent component for the fluorescent light for times t > \u03c4p . In this case,\nresonance fluorescence would no longer satisfy the criterion for the preservation of coherence (as is the case for weak\ncw excitation [26]), yet it would still be perfectly antibunched. For the case of our atom-cavity system, we would\nrequire g0\u22121 \u226a \u03c4p \u226a \u03ba\u22121 , in which case we would presumably obtain single photons on a pulse-by-pulse basis for\nthe transmitted field with polarization orthogonal to that of the drive field, again with no preservation of coherence,\nwhich is presumably also true for EIT schemes in the limit of short pulses for the excitation [2, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Note\nthat in either of these cases, the efficiency for the transformation of the pulsed driving field to a single photon at the\noutput is necessarily small because of the mismatch of bandwidths, \u03c4p \u226a \u03ba\u22121 .\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe gratefully acknowlege stimulating discussions with Atac Imamo\u1e21lu upon which the material in Sections II and VI\nis based.
