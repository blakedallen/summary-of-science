If the inclination of the planetary orbit is close to 90\u25e6 , a planet\nperiodically moves across a stellar disk, blocking a small fraction of the flux. This\nphenomenon \u2013 a transit \u2013 is observed as a small (up to \u223c3%) drop of host star's\n1 Based on observations collected at the Centro Astron\u00f3mico Hispano Alem\u00e1n (CAHA), operated jointly by the Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia\n(CSIC).\n\n\fVol. 61\n\n1\n\nbrightness. Combining spectroscopic and photometric data gives unique opportunity to determine planetary mass and radius, and hence the surface gravity and\naverage density \u2013 a key parameter for studying the internal structure of exoplanets.\nThe first exoplanetary transits were observed for HD 209458 b (Charbonneau et al.\n2000; Henry at al. 2000) which was discovered with the radial-velocity technique\n(Mazeh et al. 2000; Henry at al. 2000). The efficiency of photometric searches\nfor transiting planets is seriously affected by the high fraction of false positive scenarios because variety of phenomena may mimic a planetary transit light curve.\nExamples of these false positives are central transit of a low-mass star in front of a\nlarge main-sequence star or red giant, grazing eclipses in systems comprising two\nmain-sequence stars or a contamination of a fainter eclipsing binary along the same\nline of sight (Charbonneau et al. 2004). OGLE-TR-56 b is the first exoplanet discovered by the transit method. It was initially listed as a planetary candidate found\nby the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE, Udalski et al. 1997) in\nthe direction of the Galactic Centre (Udalski et al. 2002a,b). Then, the planetary nature of OGLE-TR-56 b was confirmed by radial velocity measurements by\nKonacki et al. (2003). Since then, over 100 extrasolar transiting planets have been\ndiscovered by numerous surveys.\nHigh-precision photometric follow-ups of transiting exoplanets allow to refine\nplanetary and stellar parameters. Such observations may also lead to discoveries of\nadditional, even very low mass bodies in extrasolar systems if transit time variations\n(TTVs) are detected (Miralda\u2013Escud\u00e9 2002; Holman & Murray 2005; Agol et al.\n2005). The example of the Kepler 9 planetary system, in which there are at least 2\ntransiting planets, clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the TTV method (Holman\net al. 2010). Preliminary detections of the TTV signal were reported for the WASP3 b and WASP-10 b transiting planets (Maciejewski at al. 2010a,b). The source\nof these deviations from a strictly Keplerian case could be additional planets in\nthese planetary systems. Detection of a TTV signal together with transit duration\nvariations (TDVs) shifted in a phase by \u03c0/2 would indicate the presence of an\nexomoon of the transiting planet (Kipping 2009).\nThe star XO-5 (GSC 02959-00729, \u03b1 = 07h 46m 52s , \u03b4 = +39\u25e6 05\u2032 41\u2032\u2032 ) was\nfound to harbour a transiting hot Jupiter, XO-5 b, which orbits its host star within\n4.2 days and whose mass and radius were found to be Mb = 1.15 \u00b1 0.08 MJ and\nRb = 1.15 \u00b1 0.12 RJ , respectively (Burke et al. 2008). High-resolution spectral\nobservations revealed that the host star is a dwarf of the G8 spectral type, has the\neffective temperature of 5510 \u00b1 44 K and is located 270 \u00b1 25 pc from the Sun.\nThe age of the system was estimated to be 8.5 \u00b1 0.8 Gyr. The planet was independently confirmed by P\u00e1l et al. (2009) who refined system's parameters. The\nplanetary mass and radius were found to be 1.059 \u00b1 0.028 MJ and 1.109 \u00b1 0.050\nRJ , respectively. The host star was found to be slightly cooler with the effective\ntemperature of 5370 \u00b1 70 K and more evolved with the age of 14.8 \u00b1 2.0 Gyr. The\norbital period was refined to 4.187757 \u00b1 0.000011 d and no sign of variations in\n\n\f2\n\nA. A.\n\ntransit timing was found. Using theoretical models, P\u00e1l et al. (2009) found that the\nplanet's core could be smaller than 10 Earth masses if a planet older than 4.5 Gyr\nis considered.\nIn this paper we present results of high-precision photometric follow-up observations whose aim was to refine parameters of the XO-5 system.\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nTwo transits of XO-5 b were observed with the 2.2-m telescope at Calar Alto\nObservatory (Spain) during 2 runs on 2010 January 21 and November 10. The\nCalar Alto Faint Object Spectrograph (CAFOS) in imaging mode was used as a\ndetector. It was equipped with the SITe CCD matrix (2048 \u00d7 2048, 24\u03bcm pixel,\n0.53 arcsec per pixel). A subframe limiting the field of view to 5.3 \u00d7 3.7 arcmin\nwas used to shorten the read-out time. During the second run, binning in 2\u00d72\nmode was used to additionally shorten the read-out time. The subframe was chosen\nin such a way to observe simultaneously a nearby comparison star GSC 0295901873 which has a colour index and brightness similar to the ones of XO-5. This\ncriterion was expected to minimise photometric trends caused by the differential\natmospheric extinction. The photometric monitoring was performed in the Johnson R-band filter in which the instrument set-up is most sensitive. The telescope\nwas significantly defocused and hence stellar profiles exhibited a donut-like shape\n(Fig. 1). This method minimises random and flat-fielding errors (e.g. Southworth\net al. 2009). The stellar flux was spread over a ring of \u223c17 arcsec in diameter.\nA visual inspection of the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) images revealed no faint\nneighbour stars up to 40 arcsec in the direct vicinity of XO-5 nor the comparison\nstar down to the limiting magnitude which is at least R \u223c 20.5 mag. The stellar\nimages were kept exactly at the same position in the CCD matrix during each run\nthanks to auto guiding. Precise timing was assured by synchronising the computer's\nclock to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by Network Time Protocol software,\naccurate to better than 0.1 s.\nCCD frames were processed using a standard procedure including debiassing\nbut not flat-fielding which does not improve measurements in the case of defocused and auto-guided observations but may also degrade the quality of data (see\ne.g. Southworth et al. 2010). Indeed, our tests showed that dividing by a flat-field\nframe had no detectable effect on a final light curve. The magnitudes of XO-5\nand comparison star were determined with differential aperture photometry. The\naperture radii ranged from 8 to 18 pixels and 6 to 14 pixels for runs 1 and 2, respectively. Beginning from the aperture radii of 8 and 12 pixels for runs 1 and 2,\nrespectively, the photometric scatter exhibited a flat minimum (or rather a plateau),\nin practice insensitive to greater aperture sizes. To avoid possible neighbour-star\ncontamination, the light curve with minimal apertures for which the lowest scatter\nwas achieved (i.e. 8 and 12 pixels for runs 1 and 2, respectively), were taken as the\n\n\fVol. 61\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. The flux distribution of the stellar profile. The donut-like shape is caused by defocusing the\ntelescope. The 30 \u00d7 30 pixel fragment corresponds to 15.9 \u00d7 15.9 arcsec on the sky (no binning).\nThe logarithmic vertical scale was used for better contrast. The data were extracted from a typical\n50-s exposure collected during the run on 2010 January 21.\n\nfinal ones. The comparison star was used to set the zero level of the photometric\nscale. No trends which could be approximated by a first- or second-order polynomial were detected in both transit light curves due to small changes of the airmass.\nTherefore, no detrending procedure was applied.\nDuring the first run, sky conditions were non-photometric and data were acquired in gaps between clouds. The ingress phase was lost and egress data were\nsignificantly affected by thin clouds. Therefore, these data were found to be of\nmarginal use. In the second run, almost photometric conditions allowed to record a\ncomplete transit light curve. Occasionally thin clouds affected flat-bottom phase of\nthe transit. The exposure time was set to get roughly 1-min cadence and avoid saturation. It was refined during out-of-transit phase to achieve maximal efficiency. To\navoid effecting transit timing, no exposure-time changes were done during ingress\nnor egress phases. Observations in both runs were carried out in dark time, just a\nfew days before or after a new moon. Hence they were not affected by moonlight.\nThe details of both observing runs are presented in Table 1.\n3.\n\nResults\n\nIndividual light curves were modelled with the JKTEBOP code (Southworth et\nal. 2004a, 2004b) which is based on the EBOP programme (Eclipsing Binary Orbit\nProgram; Etzel 1981; Popper & Etzel 1981). The software models both components of a system \u2013 a planet and a host star \u2013 as biaxial ellipsoids and performs a\nnumerical integration in concentric annuli over the surface of each body to obtain\n\n\f4\n\nA. A.\nTable1\nThe summary of observing runs: Nexp \u2013 the number of useful exposures, X \u2013 airmass changes\nduring a given run, Texp \u2013 exposure times.

This feature of the code allows to avoid small and\nspherical planet approximations which are used in analytic light-curve generators\nbased on Mandel & Agol (2002), and hence to derive planet's oblateness. A model\nis fitted to the data by the Levenberg-Marquardt least-square procedure. The code\nconverges rapidly toward a reliable solution and diminishes the correlation between\nfitted parameters (Southworth 2008).\nFor the high-quality light curve from the second run, five parameters describing a shape of a light curve were allowed to float during fitting procedure. We\nused fractional radii of the host star and planet, defined as r\u2217 = Ra\u2217 and rb = Rab ,\nrespectively, where R\u2217 and Rb are the absolute radii of the bodies and a is the orbital semi-major axis. In practise, the combinations of these parameters were used:\na sum r\u2217 + rb and ratio k = r\u2217 /rb because they were found to be the less correlated with each other (Southworth 2008). The directly fitted orbital inclination, i,\nallowed to calculate the transit parameter b = Ra\u2217 cos i. The initial values of parameters listed above were taken from P\u00e1l et al. (2009). To detect any variation in transit\ntiming between observed transits, the mid-transit time was set as a free parameter\nwhose initial value was calculated according to the ephemeris given by Burke et al.\n(2008). High-quality light curves need to set limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs)\nas free parameters and test different limb-darkening (LD) laws (Southworth 2008).\nHence, we considered linear, logarithmic and square-root LD, for which theoretical LDCs in the Johnson R band were bilinearly interpolated from tables by Van\nHamme (1993). In a first iteration we allowed both linear u and non-linear v coefficients to vary but unrealistic values were derived. Therefore, we kept v fixed at\ntheoretical values and allow only u to vary in final fitting runs. The contribution of\nv into the error budget was included by perturbing it by \u00b10.1 around its theoretical\nvalue and assuming a flat distribution.\nThe errors of derived parameters were determined in two ways for each combination of the data set and adopted LD law. Firstly, we run 1000 Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations and a spread range of a given parameter within 68.3% was taken as its\nerror estimate. Secondly, the prayer-bead method (e.g. D\u00e9sert et al. 2009; Winn\net al. 2009) was used to check whether red noise is present in our data. MC errors\nwere found to be 2\u20133 times smaller than the values returned by the prayer bead\nmethod, thus the latter ones were used as the final values. This finding indicates\n\n\fVol. 61\n\n5\n\nthat beside Poisson noise there is correlated (red) noise in the light curve.\n\nresidual\n\n\u2206 R (mmag)\n\n-5\n\n2010 January 21\n\n2010 November 10\n\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n3\n0\n-3\n-0.10\n\n-0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n0.10 -0.10\n-0.05\nTime from mid-transit (d)\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\nFig. 2.

The sub-millimagnitude precision was achieved with the rms of 0.83\nmmag. The smallest \u03c72red was achieved for the square-root LD law and this set of\nsystem's parameters was taken as the final one. However, it is worth noting that\nvalues of rms of individual fits are comparable to each other what suggests that the\nchoice of the LD law is not significant for the analysed light curve. Moreover, the\ntiming errors seem to be independent on the choice of the LD law. In all three cases\n\n\f6\n\nA. A.\n\nthe precision between 20 and 29 s was achieved.\nFull analysis of the first-run light curve was found to be unreliable, thus all\nparameters but mid-transit time were fixed and this light curve was used only for\ntransit timing. The values of system's parameters were adopted from best-fitting\nmodel obtained for the second-run light curve. The error of mid-transit time was\ndetermined with the prayer bead method. The \u03c72red of the fit was found to be 3.8\nwith the rms = 1.4 mmag what reflects the lower quality of the data.\nThe light curves acquired in both runs are plotted in Fig. 2 together with the\nbest-fitting models and residuals2 .\nThe mid-transit times available in the literature and 2 new determinations reported in this paper were used to refine the transit ephemeris. We used 8 highquality mid-transit times from Burke et al. (2008) rejecting unreliable ones which\nare based on the original XO photometry. We also used 4 mid-transit times given\nby P\u00e1l et al. (2009); values for the individually fitted transit centres were taken.\nThe mid-transit times were transformed from JD based on UTC into BJD based\non Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) using the on-line converter3 by Eastman et\nal. (2010). As a result of fitting a linear function of the epoch and period Pb , we\nobtained:\nT0 = 2454485.66842 \u00b1 0.00028 BJDTDB\nPb = 4.1877537 \u00b1 0.0000017 d.\nIndividual mid-transit errors were taken as weights. Results for new mid-transit\ntimes are summarised in Table 3. The observation minus calculation (O \u2212 C ) diagram, plotted in Fig. 3, shows no significant deviation of data points from the\nnew linear ephemeris. Some literature measurements deviate by more than 1 sigma\nwhich may be a result of underestimated timing errors.\n\nTable3\nResults of transit timing.

We used results from the best-fitting model based on\nthe second-run data and square-root LD law. Rb was calculated assuming a =\n0.0488 \u00b1 0.0006 AU (P\u00e1l et al. 2009). The planetary mean density \u03c1b uses XO5 b's mass of 1.059 \u00b1 0.028 MJ , known from radial velocity measurements (P\u00e1l\net al. 2009). Surface gravitational acceleration, gb , was calculated according to a\nformula (Southworth et al. 2007):\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 e2\ngb =\nK\u2217 ,\n(1)\nPb rb2 sin i\nwhere Pb is the orbital period of the planet (see Sect. 3) and K\u2217 is the stellar velocity\namplitude taken from P\u00e1l et al. (2009). The orbital eccentricity was assumed to be\nzero (Burke et al. 2008; P\u00e1l et al. 2009).\nThe equilibrium temperature, Teq , may be derived assuming the effective temperature of the host star derived by P\u00e1l et al. (2009) and using the relation (Southworth 2010):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 A 0.25 \u0010 r\u2217 \u00110.5\n,\n(2)\nTeq = Teff\n4F\n2\nwhere A and F are the Bond albedo and heat redistribution factor, respectively.\nThis formula was simplified by assuming relation A = 1 \u2212 4F and the modified\nequilibrium temperature Teq\u2032 was calculated (Southworth 2010).\nWe calculated the Safronov number \u0398 which determines the efficiency with\nwhich a planet gravitationally scatters other bodies (Safronov 1972). This parameter is proportional to the ratio of the escape velocity from the planet and velocity of\n\n\f8\n\nA. A.\n\nits orbital motion and can be calculated according to a formula (Southworth 2010):\nMb \u22121\n\u0398=\n(3)\nr ,\nM\u2217 b\nwhere the the value of 0.88 \u00b1 0.03 M\u2299 was taken as star's mass M\u2217 (P\u00e1l et al.\n2009).\nAssuming that the planet's rotation and orbital periods are synchronised, the\noblateness of the planet, defined as:\nr1\n(4)\nf = 1\u2212 ,\nr2\nwhere r1 and r2 are the polar and equatorial radii, respectively, was found to be\n0.0014. Such a small value indicates that any deviations of the XO-5 b's shape\nfrom an ideal sphere may be neglected.\nResults of calculations are collected in Table 4 in which literature determinations are also given for comparison.\nTable4\nPhysical properties of the XO-5 system derived from light-curve modelling.

Although sys-\n\n\fVol. 61\n\n9\n\ntem's parameters obtained by us were found to agree with previous studies by Burke\net al. (2008) and P\u00e1l et al. (2009) within one sigma, the planet was found to be notable smaller, i.e. by 7%, comparing to the value obtained by P\u00e1l et al. (2009). A\nshallower transit, and hence smaller ratio of planet and star radii, may be a sign of\nthe presence of a third light contributing to the system's light curve, e.g. a faint\nstar blended with XO-5 in the DSS image. To check this scenario, we explored the\nNaval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD, Zacharias et al. 2004)\nand found a faint source (R = 19.62 mag), located 9 arcsec to the south from XO-5.\nAssuming an extreme and unlikely case, in which a total flux of the neighbour object contributed to the XO-5 light curve, the planetary radius would be affected by\nonly 0.05% \u2013 over 100 times less than the detected difference. This result strengthens the reliability of our finding.\nThe smaller planet's radius induces larger values of the mean density, \u03c1b =\n+0.19\n+2.8\n1.27\u22120.17\ng cm \u22123 , and gravitational acceleration, gb = 24.6\u22122.3\nm s \u22122 , whose\nvalues are comparable to Jupiter's ones. Our results confirm the high Safronov\n+0.013\nnumber of XO-5 b which is equal to 0.114\u22120.011\n. Such a high value suggests that\nthe planet has not undergone a phase of the significant mass evaporation driven by\nthe radiation of the host star (e.g. Hansen & Barman 2007). This finding is not\nsurprising if one considers the spectral type of the star (G8) and a relatively small\namount of the extreme ultraviolet radiation that it emits.\nThe transit times were found to be periodic within a 3-sigma level. This finding\nreveals no hint for the existence of the additional planet which could be discovered\nby the TTV method in the XO-5 system.\nAcknowledgements.
