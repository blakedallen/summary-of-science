A Steiner quadruple system of order v is a 3 \u2212 (v, 4, 1) design,\nand will be denoted SQS(v).\nUsing the classification of finite 2-transitive permutation groups all SQS(v)\nwith a flag-transitive automorphism group are completely classified, thus solving the \"still open and longstanding problem of classifying all flag-transitive\n3 \u2212 (v, k, 1) designs\" (cf. [5, p. 273], [6]) for the smallest value of k. Moreover,\na generalization of a result of H. L\u00fcneburg [14] is achieved.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the last decades, there has been a great interest in classifying t \u2212 (v, k, \u03bb)\ndesigns with certain transitivity properties. For example, all point 2-transitive\n2 \u2212 (v, k, 1) designs were classified by Kantor [12] and a few years later Buekenhout et al. [2] reached a classification of all flag-transitive 2 \u2212 (v, k, 1) designs.\nBoth results depend on the classification of finite simple groups. However, the\nclassification of flag-transitive 3 \u2212 (v, k, 1) designs is \"a still open and longstanding\nproblem\"(cf. [5, p. 273], [6]).\nIn this article we use the classification of finite 2-transitive permutation groups to\nclassify all flag-transitive SQS(v), thus solving the above problem for the smallest\nvalue of k. Moreover, our result generalizes a theorem of L\u00fcneburg [14] that characterizes all flag-transitive SQS(v) under the additional strong assumption that\nevery non-identity element of the automorphism group fixes at most two points.\nOur procedure as well as our proofs are independent of L\u00fcneburg.\nFor positive integers t \u2264 k \u2264 v and \u03bb we define a t \u2212 (v, k, \u03bb) design to be an\nincidence structure D = (X, B, I), where X is a set of points, |X| = v, and B a set of\nblocks, |B| = b, with the properties that each block B \u2208 B is incident with k points,\nand every t-subset of X is incident with \u03bb blocks. A Steiner quadruple system\nof order v, which will be denoted by SQS(v), is a 3 \u2212 (v, 4, 1) design. Hanani [8]\nshowed that a SQS(v) exists if and only if v \u2261 2 or 4 (mod 6) (v \u2265 4).\nIn the following let D = (X, B, I) be a non-trivial SQS(v) and G \u2264 Aut(D)\na group of automorphisms of D. A flag is an incident point-block pair, that is\nx \u2208 X and B \u2208 B such that xIB, and we call G \u2264 Aut(D) to be flag-transitive\n(resp. block-transitive) if G acts transitively on the flags (resp. on the blocks) of D.\nFor short, D is called flag-transitive (resp. block-transitive, point t-transitive) if D\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Let D = (X, B, I) be a non-trivial SQS(v). Then G \u2264 Aut(D) acts\nflag-transitively on D if and only if one of the following occurs:\n(1) D is isomorphic to the SQS(2d) whose points and blocks are the points and\nplanes of the affine space AG(d, 2), and one of the following holds:\n(i) d \u2265 3, and G \u223c\n= AGL(d, 2),\n(ii) d = 3, and G \u223c\n= AGL(1, 8) or A\u0393L(1, 8),\n(iii) d = 4, and G0 \u223c\n= A7 ,\n(iv) d = 5, and G \u223c\n= A\u0393L(1, 32),\n(2) D is isomorphic to a SQS(3d + 1) whose points are the elements of\nGF (3d ) \u222a {\u221e} and whose blocks are the images of GF (3) \u222a {\u221e} under\nP GL(2, 3d ) with d \u2265 2 (resp. P SL(2, 3d) with d > 1 odd) and the derived\ndesign is isomorphic to the 2 \u2212 (3d , 3, 1) design whose points and blocks are\nthe points and lines of AG(d, 3), and P SL(2, 3d) \u2264 G \u2264 P \u0393L(2, 3d),\n(3) D is isomorphic to a SQS(q + 1) whose points are the elements of\nGF (q) \u222a {\u221e} with a prime power q \u2261 7 (mod 12) and whose blocks are the\nimages of {0, 1, \u221e, \u03b5} under P SL(2, q), where \u03b5 is a primitive sixth root of\nunity in GF (q) and the derived design is isomorphic to the Netto triple system,\nand P SL(2, q) \u2264 G \u2264 P \u03a3L(2, q).\nA detailed description of the Netto triple system can be found in [7, Section 3].\n\n2. Preliminaries\nIf D = (X, B, I) is a t \u2212 (v, k, \u03bb) design, and x \u2208 X arbitrarily, the derived design\nwith respect to x is Dx = (Xx , Bx , Ix ), where Xx = X\\{x}, Bx = {B \u2208 B : xIB}\nand Ix = I |Xx \u00d7 Bx . We shall also speak of D as being an extension of Dx .\nObviously, a derived design is a (t \u2212 1) \u2212 (v \u2212 1, k \u2212 1, \u03bb) design.\nFor g \u2208 G \u2264 Sym(X) let fix(g) denote the set of fixed points and supp(g)\nthe support of g. If {x1 , ..., xn } \u2286 X let G{x1 ,...,xn} be its setwise stabilizer and\nGx1 ,...,xn its pointwise stabilizer. If B \u2208 B let GB be its block stabilizer and G(B)\nits pointwise block stabilizer. By r \u22a5 q n \u2212 1 we mean that r divides q n \u2212 1 but not\nq k \u2212 1 for all 1 \u2264 k < n.\nAll other notation is standard.\nIf D = (X, B, I) is a t \u2212 (v, k, 1) design then it is elementary that the point\n2-transitivity of G \u2264 Aut(D) implies its flag-transitivity when t = 2. However, for\nt \u2265 3 the converse holds:\nLemma 2. Let D = (X, B, I) be a t \u2212 (v, k, 1) design with t \u2265 3. If G \u2264 Aut(D)\nacts flag-transitively on D then G also acts 2-transitively on the points of D.\nProof. Let x \u2208 X. As G acts flag-transitively on D, obviously Gx acts blocktransitively on Dx . Since block-transitivity implies transitivity on points for t \u2265 2\nby Block's Theorem [1], Gx also acts transitively on the points of Dx and the claim\nfollows.\n\u0003\n\n\fFLAG-TRANSITIVE STEINER QUADRUPLE SYSTEMS\n\n3\n\nTo classify all flag-transitive SQS(v), we can therefore use the classification of\nfinite 2-transitive permutation groups which itself relies on the classification of finite\nsimple groups (cf. [4], [9], [11], [12]).\nThe list of groups is as follows:\nLet G be a finite 2-transitive permutation group of a non-empty set X.\nThen we have either\n(A) Affine type: G contains a regular normal subgroup T which is elementary\nabelian of order v = pd , where p is a prime.

Proof of the theorem\nUsing the notation as before, let D = (X, B, I) be a SQS(v). In this section we\nrun through the list of finite 2-transitive permutation groups given in Section 2 and\nexamine successively whether G \u2264 Aut(D) acts flag-transitively on D.\n3.1. Affine case. From Section 2 we know that a 2-transitive permutation group G\nof affine type has degree v = pd .\nAs a SQS(v) exists if and only if\nv = 2 or 4 (mod 6) (v \u2265 4) by Hanani's theorem, we conclude that v = 2d in\nthis case. To avoid trivial SQS(v), let d \u2265 3.\nThe following lemma is fundamental for this case.\nLemma 4. Let D = (X, B, I) be a SQS(2d) with d \u2265 3, and G \u2264 Aut(D) contains a regular normal subgroup T which is elementary abelian of order v = 2d .\nIf G acts flag-transitively on D and |G0 | \u2261 1 (mod 2), then D is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism), and the points and blocks of D are the points and\nplanes of AG(d, 2).\nProof. T contains subgroups of order 4 as it is elementary abelian of order 2d .\nMoreover, T is the only Sylow 2-group since |G0 | \u2261 1 (mod 2), and contains therefore all subgroups of G of order 4. By assumption, GB acts transitively on the\npoints of B for B \u2208 B arbitrarily. Thus 4 is a divisor of the order of GB , and GB\ncontains at least one subgroup S of T of order 4. Then B \u2208 B is an orbit of S and\nhence an affine plane. As G \u2264 Aut(D) is block-transitive, we can conclude that all\nblocks must be affine planes. Now identify the points of D with the elements of T\nand the assertion follows.\n\u0003\nCase (1): G \u2264 A\u0393L(1, 2d ).\nLet D = (X, B, I) be a SQS(2d), d \u2265 3, and assume G \u2264 Aut(D) acts flagtransitively on D. Lemma 3 and Lagrange's theorem yield\nr = 13 (2d \u2212 1)(2d\u22121 \u2212 1) |G0 | A\u0393L(1, 2d )0 = \u0393L(1, 2d) = d(2d \u2212 1).\nThus d = 3, 5. First, assume d = 3. Then |A\u0393L(1, 8)| = |T | |\u0393L(1, 8)| = 8 * 7 * 3.\nSince G is 2-transitive, we have 8 * 7 |G|, hence |G| = 8 * 7 or 8 * 7 * 3. The latter\nimplies G \u223c\n= A\u0393L(1, 8), so assume |G| = 8*7. Since A\u0393L(1, 8) is solvable, we deduce\nfrom Hall's theorem that G \u223c\n= AGL(1, 8) as G is a Hall {2, 7}-group. For d = 5\nagain |G| = 32 * 31 or 32 * 31 * 5. We conclude G \u223c\n= A\u0393L(1, 32) as for |G| = 32 * 31\nlemma 3 yields a contradiction.\nOn the contrary, we have to show that G \u223c\n= AGL(1, 8), A\u0393L(1, 8) resp. A\u0393L(1, 32)\nacts flag-transitively on the SQS(8) resp. the SQS(32) given in the theorem.\nFor v = 8 there exists (up to isomorphism) only the unique SQS(v) consisting of\nthe points and planes of AG(3, 2). Since G \u223c\n= AGL(1, 8) acts transitively on the\npoints, it is sufficient to show that G0 \u223c\n= GL(1, 8) acts transitively on the blocks\nincident with 0. As these are exactly the 2-dimensional subspaces of the underlying\nvector space, we have\nB1 := {0, 1, t, t + 1} 6= B t = {0, t, t2 , t2 + 1} for 1 6= t \u2208 GL(1, 8) \u223c\n= GF (8)\u2217 .\n1\n\nGL(1,8)\n|B1\n| 6=\n\nThus\n1, and hence as r = 7, the claim follows by the orbit-stabilizer\nproperty. Obviously, G \u223c\n= A\u0393L(1, 8) acts flag-transitively on D as well. For\nv = 32 we have by lemma 4 also only the unique SQS(v) consisting of the points\nand planes of AG(5, 2) because |G0 | = |\u0393L(1, 32)| \u2261 1 (mod 2). To see that\n\n\fFLAG-TRANSITIVE STEINER QUADRUPLE SYSTEMS\n\n5\n\nG0 \u223c\n= \u0393L(1, 32) acts flag-transitively on the blocks incident with 0, examine as beGL(1,32)\nfore that |B1\n| 6= 1, thus |GL(1, 32)B | = 1 for any 0 \u2208 B \u2208 B by the orbitstabilizer property. Hence |B \u0393L(1,32)| = 31 or 31 * 5. Assuming the first yields\n|\u0393L(1, 32)B | = 5 by the orbit-stabilizer property again. Let H be a cyclic group\nof order 5. Then |HB | 6= 1 for any 0 \u2208 B \u2208 B. On the other hand, 5 is a 2primitive divisor of 24 \u2212 1. Thus H has irreducible modules of degree 4 in view\nof [9, Theorem 3.5]. As the 5-dimensional GF (32)H-module is completely reducible\nby Maschke's theorem, H has as irreducible modules only the trivial module and\none of degree 4. But if H fixes any 2-dimensional vector subspace then, again by\nMaschke's theorem, H would have as irreducible modules two 1-dimensional modules, a contradiction. Therefore, |B \u0393L(1,32)| = 31 * 5 must hold and the claim follows\nas r = 31 * 5.\nCase (2): G0 D SL( ad , 2a ).\nFor a = 1 we have G \u223c\n= AGL(d, 2). Here G is 3-transitive and the only SQS(v)\non which G acts is the one whose points and blocks are the points and planes of\nAG(d, 2), d \u2265 3, by Kantor [12]. Obviously, G is also flag-transitive. As a = d has\nalready been done in case (1) we can assume that a is a proper divisor of d. We\nprove that here no flag-transitive SQS(v) exists.\nBecause of lemma 3, it is enough to show that r is no divisor of |G0 |.\nClearly,\nd\n\nSL( ad , 2a )\n\n=2\n\nd\nd( a\n\u22121)/2\n\na\nY\n\n(2ia \u2212 1),\n\ni=2\n\nand [\u0393L( ad , 2a ) : SL( ad , 2a )] = |Aut(GF (2a ))| |GF (2a )\u2217 | = a * (2a \u2212 1).\nThus it is sufficient to show that r does not divide a * (2a \u2212 1) * SL( ad , 2a ) .\nBy Zsigmondy's theorem (cf. [15, p. 283])\n2d\u22121 \u2212 1\nhas a 2-primitive prime divisor r\u0303 6= 1 with r\u0303 \u22a5 2d\u22121 \u2212 1. Obviously, r\u0303 6= 2.\nFurthermore, r\u0303 6 | 3a since r\u0303 \u2261 1 (mod (d \u2212 1)) (cf. [9, Theorem 3.5]) and d is\nproperly divisible by a.\nTherefore,\nd\na \u22121\n\n2d\u22121 \u2212 1 6\n\n3a * 2\n\nd\nd( a\n\u22121)/2\n\nY\n\n(2ia \u2212 1)\n\ni=1\n\nand the claim follows.\nCases (3)-(4): These cases can be eliminated analogous case (2) using lemma 3\nand Zsigmondy's theorem. (For |Out(G0 )| see e.g. [13, Table 5.1 A]).\nCase (5): G0 \u223c\n= A6 or A7 , v = 24 .\n\u223c\nIf G = A6 then lemma 3 implies that G cannot act flag-transitively on any\nSQS(v).\nAs G \u223c\n= A7 is 3-transitive and the only SQS(v) on which G acts is the one whose\npoints and blocks are the points and planes of AG(4, 2) by Kantor [12], we have\nalso flag-transitivity in this case.\nCases (6)-(8): These cases cannot occur since v is no power of 2.\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL HUBER\n\n3.2. Semisimple case. The cases (3), (5), (8), (12) from the list where G is of\nsemisimple type can easily be ruled out as above by using lemma 3. Obviously,\nthe cases (4), (7), (10), (11), (13) cannot occur by Hanani's theorem.\nBefore we proceed we indicate\nLemma 5. Let V (d, q) be a vector space of dimension d > 3 over GF (q) and\nP G(d\u22121, q) the (d\u22121)-dimensional projective space. Assume G containing P SL(d, q)\nacts on P G(d \u2212 1, q) and for all g \u2208 G with |M g \u2229 M| \u2265 3 we have M g = M , where\nM is an arbitrary set of points of P G(d \u2212 1, q) of cardinality k with 3 \u2264 k \u2264 |H|,\nand H a hyperplane of P G(d \u2212 1, q).\nIf |M \u2229 H| \u2265 3, then M \u2229 H = M holds.\nd\u22121\n\nProof. For k = 3 the assertion is trivial. So assume 3 < k \u2264 |H| = q q\u22121\u22121 . In\nP G(d \u2212 1, q) Desargues' theorem holds and the translations T (H) form an abelian\ngroup which is sharply transitive on the points of P G(d \u2212 1, q) \\ H by Baer's\ntheorem. But on H the group T (H) acts trivially since the central collineations fix\neach point of H. Thus the claim holds if all elements of M lie in H. Therefore,\nassume that there is an element of M which is not in H. Then M contains all\npoints of P G(d \u2212 1, q) \\ H as T (H) is transitive. Thus\n|M | \u2265\n\nq d \u2212 q d\u22121\nq d\u22121 \u2212 1\nq d \u2212 1 q d\u22121 \u2212 1\n\u2212\n=\n= q d\u22121 >\n= |H| .\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\n\nBut this contradicts the assumption |M | \u2264 |H| , and the claim follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nCase (1): N = Av , v \u2265 5. Here, G is 3-transitive and does not act on any\nnon-trivial 3 \u2212 (v, k, 1) design by Kantor [12].\nd\n\n\u22121\nCase (2): N = P SL(d, q), d \u2265 2, v = qq\u22121\n, where (d, q) 6= (2, 2), (2, 3).\nWe distinguish two subcases:\n(i) N = P SL(2, q), v = q + 1.\nHere q \u2265 5 as P SL(2, 4) \u223c\n= P SL(2, 5), and Aut(N ) = P \u0393L(2, q). First suppose\nthat G is 3-transitive. According to Kantor [12], we have then only the SQS(3d +1)\ndescribed in (2) of theorem 1, and P SL(2, 3d) \u2264 G \u2264 P \u0393L(2, 3d). Obviously, also\nflag-transitivity holds. As P GL(2, q) is a transitive extension of AGL(1, q), it is\neasily seen that the derived design at any point of GF (3d ) \u222a {\u221e} is isomorphic to\nthe 2 \u2212 (3d , 3, 1) design consisting of the points and lines of AG(d, 3).\nNow assume that G is 3-homogeneous but not 3-transitive. As here P SL(2, q) is\na transitive extension of AG2 L(1, q) we deduce from [7] that the derived design is\neither the affine space AG(d, 3) or the Netto triple system. Thus (2) with the part\nin brackets or (3) of theorem 1 holds with P SL(2, 3d) \u2264 G \u2264 P \u03a3L(2, 3d) (where\nP \u03a3L(2, pd) := P SL(2, pd) >\u22b3 < \u03c4\u03b1 > with \u03c4\u03b1 \u2208 Sym(GF (pd ) \u222a {\u221e}) \u223c\n= Sv of\norder d induced by the Frobenius automorphism \u03b1 : GF (pd ) \u2212\u2192 GF (pd ), x 7\u2192 xp .)\nConversely, as G is 3-homogeneous it is also block-transitive. In both cases we\nhave P SL(2, q)B \u223c\n= A4 for any B \u2208 B since P SL(2, q)B has order 12 by the orbitstabilizer property and P SL(2, q)B \u2212\u2192 Sym(B) \u223c\n= S4 is a faithful representation.\nThus, in each case flag-transitivity holds.\nFinally, suppose G is not 3-homogeneous. As P GL(2, q) is 3-homogeneous\nthe P GL(2, q)-orbit on 3-subsets therefore splits under P SL(2, q) into two orbits of same length. Let M be an arbitrary 3-subset. Then |P SL(2, q)M | =\n|P GL(2, q)M | = 6 by the orbit-stabilizer property. Thus, as P GL(2, q) is 3-transitive\n\n\fFLAG-TRANSITIVE STEINER QUADRUPLE SYSTEMS\n\n7\n\nwe have P SL(2, q)M \u223c\n= S3 for each orbit. If P SL(2, q) acts block-transitively on\nany SQS(v) then P SL(2, q)B \u223c\n= A4 again for any B \u2208 B. But, by the definition of\nSQS(v) this would imply that P SL(2, q)B\u0303 , where B\u0303 denotes the block uniquely determined by M , contains P SL(2, q)M , a contradiction. Thus P SL(2, q) does not act\nflag-transitively on any SQS(v). We show now that G cannot act flag-transitively\non any SQS(v). Without restriction choose O1 to be the P SL(2, q)-orbit containing {0, 1, \u221e}. Easy calculation shows that P \u03a3L(2, q)0,1,\u221e = <\u03c4\u03b1>. Thus\nP \u03a3L(2, q)O1 is contained in P \u0393L(2, q), and equality holds as P \u03a3L(2, q) is of index 2\nin P \u0393L(2, q) and P \u0393L(2, q) is 3-transitive. Therefore, we only have to consider\nP SL(2, q) \u2264 G \u2264 P \u03a3L(2, q). Dedekind's law yields G = P SL(2, q) >\u22b3 (G \u2229 <\u03c4\u03b1>)\nand G(B) = P SL(2, q)(B) >\u22b3 G \u2229 <\u03c4\u03b1> = G \u2229 <\u03c4\u03b1> \u223c\n= Cm , the cyclic group of\norder m | d, for any B \u2208 B since every non-identity element of P SL(2, q) fixes\nat most two points. Assume G acts block-transitively on any SQS(v). Then we\ncan choose B \u2208 B such that B contains {0, 1, \u221e}. Since G(B) is the kernel of the\nrepresentation GB \u2212\u2192 Sym(B) \u223c\n= A4 we have therefore\n= S4 and P SL(2, q)B \u223c\nagain by Dedekind's law\nGB = P SL(2, q)B \u00d7 (G \u2229 <\u03c4\u03b1>) \u223c\n= A4 \u00d7 Cm .\nHowever, as P SL(2, q){0,1,\u221e} \u223c\n= S3 we get analogously\nG{0,1,\u221e} = P SL(2, q){0,1,\u221e} \u00d7 (G \u2229 <\u03c4\u03b1>) \u223c\n= S3 \u00d7 Cm ,\nwhich leads again to a contradiction by the definition of SQS(v).\nd\n\u22121\n.\n(ii) N = P SL(d, q), d \u2265 3, v = qq\u22121\nHere Aut(N ) = P \u0393L(d, q) >\u22b3 < \u03b9 >, where \u03b9 denotes a graph automorphism.\nWe show that G does not act on any SQS(v). For d = 3 this is obvious since\nv = q 2 + q + 1 is always odd, a contradiction to Hanani's theorem.\nConsider d > 3 and let H be a hyperplane of the projective space P G(d \u2212 1, q).\nAssume that the claim does not hold. Then there is a counterexample with d\nminimal. Without restriction we can choose three arbitrary points \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 from H.\nAs for d > 3\nq d\u22121 \u2212 1\n|H| =\n>4\nq\u22121\nholds, the block uniquely determined by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 is contained in H by lemma 5.\nd\u22121\nThus H induces a SQS( q q\u22121\u22121 ) on which G containing P SL(d \u2212 1, q) operates.\nBy induction, we get the minimal counterexample for d = 3. So G containing\n3\n3\n\u22121\n\u22121\n). But, as above qq\u22121\n= q 2 + q + 1 is always odd\nP SL(3, q) acts on a SQS( qq\u22121\nyielding the desired contradiction.\nCase (6): N = Sp(2d, 2), d \u2265 3, v = 22d\u22121 \u00b1 2d\u22121 .\nHere N = G since |Out(N )| = 1 (cf. [13, Table 5.1 A]). We show that G contains elements which fix exactly 3 points and hence cannot act on any SQS(v) by\ndefinition.\nLet X + respectively X \u2212 denote the set of points on which G operates with\n|X + | = 22d\u22121 + 2d\u22121 resp. |X \u2212 | = 22d\u22121 \u2212 2d\u22121 , and define\nmp (G) := min{|supp(g)| : 1 6= g \u2208 G, g a p-element of G}\nto be the minimal p-degree of a transitive permutation group G, p a prime divisor\nof |G| (cf. [10]).\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL HUBER\n\nFirst, suppose d is even. By Zsigmondy's theorem\n2d\u22121 \u2212 1\nhas a 2-primitive prime divisor p with p \u22a5 2d\u22121 \u2212 1. Moreover, p divides |G|\n2 Qd\n2i\n\u2212 1) (see e.g. [13, Table 2.1 C]). Therefore, according\nsince |G| = 2d\ni=1 (2\nto [10, Theorem 3.7] we get in X +\nmp (G) = 22d\u22122(d\u22121)\u22121 (22(d\u22121) \u2212 1) + 2d\u2212(d\u22121)\u22121 (2d\u22121 \u2212 1) = X + \u2212 3.\nThus, there exists g \u2208 G of prime order p that fixes 3 points in X + .\nFor d 6= 4 Zsigmondy's theorem yields the existence of a 2-primitive prime divisor\np with p \u22a5 22(d\u22121) \u22121 and as p divides |G| we have in X \u2212 again by [10, Theorem 3.7]\nmp (G) = 22d\u22122(d\u22121)\u22121(22(d\u22121) \u2212 1) \u2212 2d\u2212(d\u22121)\u22121(2d\u22121 + 1) = X \u2212 \u2212 3.\nWhen d = 4 then [3, p. 123] yields |fix(g)| = 3 in X \u2212 for g \u2208 3D, where 3D denotes\na conjugacy class in [3].\nNow, suppose d is odd. Again by Zsigmondy's theorem and [10, Theorem 3.7]\nthere exists a 2-primitive prime divisor p with p \u22a5 22(d\u22121) \u22121, and mp (G) = |X \u2212 |\u22123\nin X \u2212 .\nIf d 6= 7 Zsigmondy's theorem\n\u0012 yields \u0013the existence of a 2-primitive prime divisor\nA0 A1\nd\u22121\np with p \u22a5 2\n\u2212 1.

Therefore, this case cannot occur finishing the proof\nof theorem 1.\nAcknowledgment. I would like to thank my supervisor Ch. Hering for his advice\nand helpful discussions.\nReferences\n1. R. E.
