Results in this direction address the issue\nof an intrinsic geometric description of the spectrum of the conformal field theory, and a geometric derivation of the characters of the partition function. The computations that have\nbeen performed so far depend on the explicit computation of the Hasse-Weil L-function of\nFermat varieties, or more generally Brieskorn-Pham type spaces. The special feature of these\nmanifolds, first observed by Weil [1, 2] about fifty years ago, is that the cohomological Lfunction can be expressed in terms of number theoretic L-functions, defined by special kinds\nof so-called Gr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere, or algebraic Hecke characters. Weil's analysis of Fermat type\nL-functions in terms of Jacobi-sum Gr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere was generalized by Yui to the class of\nBrieskorn-Pham L-functions [3]. It was shown in [4] that the algebraic number field that\nemerges from the Hasse-Weil L-function of an exactly solvable Calabi-Yau variety leads to the\nfusion field of the underlying conformal field theory and thereby to the quantum dimensions.\nIt was further proven in [5] that the modular form defined by the Mellin transform of the\nHasse-Weil L-function of the Fermat torus arises from the characters of the underlying conformal field theory. This establishes a connection between algebraic varieties and Kac-Moody\nalgebras via their modular properties.\nThe basic ingredient of the investigations described in Refs. [4, 5] is the Hasse-Weil L-function,\nan object which collects information of the variety at all prime numbers, therefore providing\na 'global' quantity that is associated to Calabi-Yau varieties. The number theoretic interpretation which leads to the physical results proceeded in a somewhat experimental way, by\nobserving the appearance of Jacobi-sum characters in [4], and that of affine theta functions in\n[5]. This leaves open the question whether these results depend on the special nature of the\nvarieties under consideration, or whether it is possible to identify an underlying conceptual\nframework that explains the emergence of conformal field theoretic quantities from the discrete structure of the Calabi-Yau variety. It is this problem which we address in the present\npaper.\nIn principle, the physical question raised translates into a simply stated mathematical problem:\nprovide a theorem that states the conditions under which the geometric Hasse-Weil L-function\ndecomposes into a product of number theoretic L-functions. If such a statement were known\n2\n\n\fone could ask whether the class of varieties that satisfies the stated conditions can be used\nto derive conformal field theoretic results, e.g. in the spirit of the results of [4, 5]. It turns\nout that this question is very difficult. In dimension one it basically is the Shimura-Taniyama\nconjecture, which has been recently proven in full generality by work [6] that extends the\nresults by Wiles and Taylor in the semistable case [7].\nIn higher dimensions much less is known, and the problem is often summarized as the Langlands program, a set of conjectures, which might be paraphrased as the hope that certain\nconjectured geometric objects, called motives, lead to Hasse-Weil L-series that arise from automorphic representations [8]. At present very little is known in this direction as far as general\nstructure theorems are concerned. There exists, however, a subclass of varieties for which useful results have been known for some time, and which turns out to be useful in the present\ncontext. In dimension one this is the class of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM),\ni.e. such curves admit a symmetry algebra that is exceptionally large. It was first shown by\nDeuring in the fifties [9], following a suggestion of Weil in [2], that for such tori with CM the\ncohomological L-function becomes a number theoretic object. More precisely, he showed that\nassociated to the complex multiplication field of the elliptic curve are algebraic Hecke characters which describe the Hasse-Weil L-function, much like Weil's Jacobi-sum Gr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere\ndo in the case of the Fermat varieties. This provides an explicit description of the L-function\nfor toroidal compactifications.\nComplex multiplication is a group property, and it is not obvious what the most convenient\nphysical generalization of this notion is for higher dimensional Calabi-Yau varieties. One\ninteresting attempt in this direction was recently made by Gukov and Vafa [10], who conjectured that exactly solvable Calabi-Yau varieties can be characterized in terms of a property\nof the intermediate Jacobian described in [11, 12, 13] (see also [14]). In the present paper\nwe follow a different approach, which is motivated in part by the results of [5] and [15]. In\n[15] our focus was on properties of black hole attractor Calabi-Yau varieties with finite fundamental group. In an interesting paper Moore [16] has shown that attractor varieties with\nelliptic factors are distinguished by the fact that they admit complex multiplication. The aim\nof [15] was to introduce a framework in which the notion of complex multiplication can be\ngeneralized to non-toroidal Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrary dimension via abelian varieties\nthat can be derived from the Calabi-Yau cohomology. Abelian varieties are natural higher\ndimensional generalizations of elliptic curves, and certain types admit complex multiplication.\n\n3\n\n\fThe link between Calabi-Yau manifolds and abelian varieties therefore allows us to generalize\nthe elliptic analysis to the higher dimensional abelian case.\nIn the most general context, the relation between exactly solvable Calabi-Yau varieties and\ncomplex multiplication very likely goes beyond abelian varieties and involves the theory of\nmotives with (potential) complex multiplication. The program of constructing a satisfactory\nframework of motives is incomplete at this point, despite much effort. In this paper we\ntherefore focus on the simpler case of exactly solvable Calabi-Yau varieties that lead to motives\nderived from abelian varieties which admit complex multiplication. We provide a conceptual\nexplanation of the results of [4] and thereby establish a framework that extends the analysis\nof [4] to general Calabi-Yau manifolds.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we very briefly recall the arithmetic\nand number theoretic concepts that will be used in the following parts. In Section 4 we\ndiscuss two explicit examples of Fermat type which illustrate the transition from geometry to\nnumber theory in a concrete way. In Section 5 we discuss Deuring's result, which provides\na number theoretic interpretation of the L-function of arbitrary elliptic curves with complex\nmultiplication. We use an id\u00e8lic formulation of Deuring's ideal theoretic analysis because\nthis allows us to clearly identify the geometric structure that provides the conceptual basis\nof this result \u2212 the discrete set of torsion point on the elliptic curves.In Section 6 we review\n\nthe structure of higher dimensional abelian varieties with complex multiplication and show\nhow their L-functions can be expressed in terms of algebraic Hecke characters. In Section 7\nwe describe how one can associate abelian varieties to Calabi-Yau manifolds by tracing the\ncohomology of Calabi-Yau varieties to the Jacobians of curves [15]. Section 8 contains an\nexample, and in Section 9 we collect some results from ad\u00e8lic number theory for convenience.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nArithmetic L-functions\nThe Hasse-Weil L-function\n\nThe starting point of the arithmetic analysis is the set of Weil conjectures [1], the proof of\nwhich was completed by Deligne [17]. For algebraic varieties the Weil\u2013Deligne result states a\nnumber of structural properties for the congruent zeta function at a prime number p defined\n4\n\n\fas\ntr\nZ(X/IFp , t) \u2261 exp\n# (X/IFpr )\nr\nr\u2208IN\nX\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThe motivation to arrange the numbers Npr = # (X/IFpr ) in this particular way, rather than a\nP\nmore naive generating function like r Nr,p tr , originates from the fact that they often show a\nsimple behavior, as a result of which the zeta function can be shown to be a rational function.\nThis was first shown by Artin in the 1920s for hyperelliptic function fields [18] and by Schmidt\nfor curves of arbitrary genus [19, 20]. Further experience by Hasse, Weil, and others led to the\nconjecture that this phenomenon is more general, culminating in the Weil conjectures, and\nDeligne's proof in the 1970s.\nThe part of the conjectures that is most important for the present context is that the rational\nfactors of Z(X/IFp , t)\nZ(X/IFp , t) =\n\n(p)\nj=1 P2j\u22121 (t)\n,\nQd\n(p)\nP\n(t)\nj=0 2j\n\nQd\n\ncan be written as\n(p)\n\n(p)\n\nP2d (t) = 1 \u2212 pd t\n\nP0 (t) = 1 \u2212 t,\nand for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2d \u2212 1\n(p)\nPi (t)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nbi \u0010\n\u0011\nY\n(i)\n=\n1 \u2212 \u03b2j (p)t ,\n\n(4)\n\nj=1\n\n(i)\n\n(p)\n\nwith algebraic integers \u03b2j (p). The degree of the polynomials Pi (t) is given by the Betti\n\nnumbers of the variety, bi = dim HiDeRham (X). The rationality of the zeta function was first\n\nshown by Dwork [21] by ad\u00e9lic methods. More details of the Weil conjectures were briefly\ndescribed in [4].\nWe see from the rationality of the zeta function that the basic information of this quantity\nis parametrized by the cohomology of the variety. More precisely, one can show that the\n(p)\n\ni'th polynomial Pi (t) is associated to the action induced by the Frobenius morphism on\n\nthe ith cohomology group Hi (X). In order to gain insight into the arithmetic information\nencoded in these Frobenius actions it is useful to decompose the zeta function of the variety\ninto pieces determined by its cohomology. This leads to the concept of a local L-function that\n(p)\n\nis associated to the polynomials Pi (t) via the following definition.\n(p)\n\nLet Pi (t) be the polynomials determined by the rational congruent zeta function over the\n5\n\n\ffield IFp . The ith L-function of the variety X over IFp then is defined via\nL(i) (X/IFp , s) =\n\n1\n(p)\nPi (p\u2212s )\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nSuch L-functions are of interest for a number reasons. One of these is that often they can be\nmodified by simple factors so that after analytic continuation they (are conjectured to) satisfy\nsome type of functional equation.\n\n2.2\n\nArithmetic via Jacobi sums\n\nIn the case of weighted projected Brieskorn-Pham varieties it is possible to provide more insight\n(p)\n\ninto the structure of the L-function polynomials Pd (t). In the case of Fermat hypersurfaces\n\nit is an old result by Weil according to which the cardinalities of the variety in terms of Jacobi\nsums of finite fields.\nTheorem.[1] Define the number d = (n, q \u2212 1) and the set\n(\nAq,n\ns =\n\n(\u03b10 , ..., \u03b1s ) \u2208 Qs+1 | 0 < \u03b1i < 1, d\u03b1i = 0 (mod 1),\n\nThen the number of solutions of the projective variety\n(\nXs\u22121 =\n\n(z0 : z1 : * * * : zs ) \u2208 IPs |\n\ns\nX\n\nbi zin\n\n)\n\nX\n\n(6)\n\n\u2282 IPs\n\n(7)\n\ni\n\n=0\n\ni=0\n\n\u03b1i = 0 (mod 1) .\n\n)\n\nover the finite field IFq is given by\nNq (Xs\u22121 ) = 1 + q + q 2 + * * * + q s\u22121 +\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\u2208Aq,n\ns\n\nj(\u03b1)\n\nY\n\n\u03c7\u0304\u03b1i (bi ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere d = (n, q \u2212 1) and\njq (\u03b1) =\n\n1\nq\u22121\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u03b10 (u0 ) * * * \u03c7\u03b1s (us ),\n\nui \u2208IFq\n\n(9)\n\nu0 +***+us =0\n\nwith\n\u03c7\u03b1i (ui ) = e2\u03c0i\u03b1i mi ,\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere mi is determined via ui = g mi for any generator g \u2208 IFq .\nWith these Jacobi sums jq (\u03b10 , ..., \u03b1s ) one defines the polynomials\n(q)\nPs\u22121 (t)\n\n=\n\nY\n\n\u03b1\u2208An,q\ns\n\n1 \u2212 (\u22121)s\u22121 jq (\u03b10 , ..., \u03b1s )\n\nY\n\n!\n\n\u03c7\u0304\u03b1i (bi )t\n\ni\n\n(11)\n\nand the associated L-function\nL(j) (X, s) =\n\nY\np\n\n1\n(p)\nPj (p\u2212s )\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nA slight modification of this result is useful even in the case of weighted projective BrieskornPham varieties because it can be used to compute the factor of the zeta function coming\nfrom the invariant part of the cohomology, when viewing these spaces as quotient varieties of\nprojective spaces [3].\n\n3\n\nL-Functions of algebraic number fields\n\nThe surprising aspect of the Hasse-Weil L-function is that it is determined by another, a\npriori completely different kind of L-function that is derived not from a variety but from a\nnumber field. It is this possibility to interpret the cohomological Hasse-Weil L-function as a\nfield theoretic L-function which establishes the connection that allows us to derive number\nfields K from algebraic varieties X.\nIn the present context the type of L-function that is important is that of a Hecke L-function\ndetermined by a Hecke character, more precisely an algebraic Hecke character. Following Weil\nwe will see that the relevant field for Fermat type varieties is the cyclotomic field extension\nQ(\u03bcm ) of the rational field Q by roots of unity, generated by \u03be = e2\u03c0i/m for some rational\ninteger m. It turns out that these fields fit in very nicely with the conformal field theory point\nof view. In order to see how this works we first describe the concept of Hecke characters and\nthen explain how the L-function fits into this framework.\nThere are many different different definitions of algebraic Hecke characters, depending on the\nprecise number theoretic framework. Originally this concept was introduced by Hecke [22] as\n7\n\n\fGr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere of an arbitrary algebraic number field. In the following Deligne's adaptation\nof Weil's Gr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere of type A0 is used [23].\nDefinition. Let OK \u2282 K be the ring of integers of the number field K, f \u2282 OK an integral\nideal, and F a field of characteristic zero. Denote by If(K) the set of fractional ideals of K\n\nthat are prime to f and denote by Ifp (K) the principal ideals (\u03b1) of K for which \u03b1 \u2261 1(mod f).\nAn algebraic Hecke character modulo f is a multiplicative function \u03c7 defined on the ideals\n\nIf(K) for which the following condition holds. There exists an element in the integral group\nP\nring\nn\u03c3 \u03c3 \u2208 ZZ[Hom(K, F\u0304 )], where F\u0304 is the algebraic closure of F , such that if (\u03b1) \u2208 Ifp (K)\n\nthen\n\n\u03c7((\u03b1)) =\n\nY\n\n\u03c3(\u03b1)n\u03c3 .\n\n(13)\n\n\u03c3\n\nFurthermore there is an integer w > 0 such that n\u03c3 + n\u03c3\u0304 = w for all \u03c3 \u2208 Hom(K, F\u0304 ). This\n\ninteger w is called the weight of the character \u03c7.\n\nGiven any such character \u03c7 defined on the ideals of the algebraic number field K we can follow\nHecke and consider a generalization of the Dirichlet series via the L-function\nL(\u03c7, s) =\n\nY\n\np\u2282OK\n\np prime\n\n1\n1\u2212\n\n\u03c7(p)\nNps\n\n=\n\nX \u03c7(a)\n,\nNas\na\u2282O\n\n(14)\n\nK\n\nwhere the sum runs through all the ideals. Here Np denotes the norm of the ideal p, which is\ndefined as the number of elements in OK /p. The norm is a multiplicative function, hence it\n\ncan be extended to all ideals via the prime ideal decomposition of a general ideal. If we can\ndeduce from the Hasse-Weil L-function the particular Hecke character(s) involved we will be\nable to derive directly from the variety in an intrinsic way distinguished number field(s) K.\nInsight into the nature of number fields can be gained by recognizing that for certain extensions\nK of the rational number Q the higher Legendre symbols provide the characters that enter\nthe discussion above. Inspection then suggests that we consider the power residue symbols\nof cyclotomic fields K = Q(\u03bcm ) with integer ring OK = ZZ[\u03bcm ]. The transition from the\ncyclotomic field to the finite fields is provided by the character which is determined for any\nalgebraic integer x \u2208 ZZ[\u03bcm ] prime to m by the map\n\u03c7\u2022 (x) : Im (OK ) \u2212\u2192 C\u00d7 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is defined on ideals p prime to m by sending the prime ideal to the m'th root of unity\n8\n\n\ffor which\np 7\u2192 \u03c7p(x) = x\n\nNp\u22121\nm\n\n(mod p).\n\n(16)\n\nUsing these characters one can define Jacobi-sums of rank r for any fixed element a =\n(a1 , ..., ar ) by setting\nJa(r) (p) = (\u22121)r+1\nP\n\nX\n\nui \u2208OK /p\n\ni\n\n\u03c7p(u1 )a1 * * * \u03c7p(ur )ar\n\n(17)\n\nui =\u22121(mod p)\n\nfor prime p. For non-prime ideals a \u2282 OK the sum is generalized via prime decomposition\nQ\nQ\na = i pi and multiplicativity Ja (a) = i Ja (pi ). Hence we can interpret these Jacobi sums\n\nas a map J (r) of rank r\n\nJ (r) : Im (ZZ[\u03bcm ]) \u00d7 (ZZ/mZZ)r \u2212\u2192 C\u00d7 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere Im denotes the ideals prime to m. For fixed p such Jacobi sums define characters on the\n(r)\n\ngroup (ZZ/mZZ)r . It can be shown that for fixed a \u2208 (ZZ/mZZ)r the Jacobi sum Ja evaluated\nat principal ideals (x) for x \u2261 1(mod mr ) is of the form xS(a) , where\n\" r \u001c \u001d#\nX X\nlai\n\u03c3l\u22121 ,\nS(a) =\nm\ni=1\n(l,m)=1\n\n(19)\n\nl mod m\n\nwhere < x > denotes the fractional part of x and [x] describes the integer part of x.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nExamples\nThe elliptic Fermat curve\n\nIn [5] the elliptic curve defined by the plane cubic torus\nC3 = {(z0 : z1 : z2 ) \u2208 IP2 | z03 + z13 + z23 = 0}\n\n(20)\n\nwas analyzed in some detail.\nThe zeta function (1) simplifies for curves into the form\nZ(X, s) =\n\nY\n\nZ \u220bp good prime\n\nP (p) (p\u2212s )\n\u03b6(s)\u03b6(s \u2212 1)\n=\n,\n\u2212s\n1\u2212s\n(1 \u2212 p )(1 \u2212 p )\nLHW (X, s)\n9\n\n(21)\n\n\fwritten in terms of the Hasse-Weil L-function defined as\nY\n1\n,\nLHW (X, s) =\n(p)\nP (p\u2212s )\nZ \u220bp good prime\nQ\nand the Riemann zeta function \u03b6(s) = p (1 \u2212 p\u2212s )\u22121 of the rational field Q.\n\n(22)\n\nThe Hasse-Weil L-function can be determined via (1) by direct counting of the number of\nsolutions of C3 /IFpr over finite extensions [IFpr : IFp ] of the finite fields IFp of prime order p.\nThis results in\n\n1\n5\n4\n7\n2\n\u2212 s + s + s \u2212 s + ***,\ns\n4\n7\n13\n16\n19\nleading to the Hasse-Weil q\u2212expansion\nLHW (C3 , s) = 1 \u2212\n\n(23)\n\nfHW (C3 , q) = q \u2212 2q 4 \u2212 q 7 + 5q 13 + 4q 16 \u2212 7q 19 + * * *\n\n(24)\n\nIt turns out that this is a modular form of weight 2 and modular level 27 which can be written\nas a product of the theta function \u0398(\u03c4 ) associated to the string function c(\u03c4 ) of the affine\nSU(2) Kac-Moody algebra at conformal level k = 1. More precisely, the following result was\nobtained.\nTheorem.([5]) The Mellin transform of the Hasse-Weil L-function LHW (C3 , s) of the cubic\nelliptic curve C3 \u2282 IP2 is a modular form fHW (C3 , q) \u2208 S2 (\u03930 (27)) which factors into the\nproduct\n\nfHW (C3 , q) = \u0398(q 3 )\u0398(q 9 ).\n\n(25)\n\u221a\nHere \u0398(\u03c4 ) = \u03b7 3 (\u03c4 )c(\u03c4 ) is the Hecke modular form associated to the quadratic extension Q( 3)\nof the rational field Q, determined by the unique string function c(\u03c4 ) of the affine Kac-Moody\nSU(2)-algebra at conformal level k = 1.\nThis establishes that it is possible to derive the modularity of the underlying string theoretic\nconformal field theory from the geometric target space and that the Hasse-Weil L-function\nadmits a conformal field theoretic interpretation.\nThe number theoretic interpretation of the Hasse-Weil L-function is best seen from the expression for the polynomials P (p) (t), which completely determine the congruent zeta function\n\nand the Hasse-Weil L-function of these plane curves, in terms of the finite field Jacobi sums.\nFor curves this reduces to\nP (p) (t) =\n\nY\n\n\u03b1\u2208Ap2\n\n10\n\n(1 \u2212 jp (\u03b1)t)\n\n(26)\n\n\fwith\njq (\u03b1) =\n\n1\nq\u22121\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u03b10 (u0 )\u03c7\u03b11 (u1 )\u03c7\u03b12 (u2 ).\n\n(27)\n\nui \u2208IFq\n\nu0 +u1 +u2 =0\n\nCollecting values at primes is in part easier than direct counting because the cardinalities\nof the sets Ap2 are easy to control.

The question therefore arises whether there are other varieties for which\na number theoretic decomposition is possible. This issue was addressed first by Deuring for\nelliptic curves with complex multiplication, i.e. elliptic curves E whose endomorphism algebra\nEnd(E) is not restricted to multiplication by integers. He showed that a similar structure of\nthe Hasse-Weil L-function arises with characters that are algebraic Hecke characters \u03c7 (more\ndetails on the construction of these characters will be described in the next subsection). Given\nany such character defined on the ideals of the algebraic number field K we can consider\nHecke's L-function (14). The result of Deuring then determines the Hasse-Weil L-function\nof any elliptic curve with complex multiplication as a number theoretic object. Even though\nDeuring's result is general for CM elliptic curve, the arguments that establish this identity\ndepend on the behavior of the complex multiplication field F relative to the field of definition\nK. The following result describes the simpler situation when the field F is contained in the\nfield K.\nTheorem. ([9]). Let E/K be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the ring of\nintegers OF of the algebraic field F , End(E) \u223c\n= OF . Assume that F is contained in K and let\n\n\u03c7 be the algebraic Hecke character associated to E. Then\n\nL(E/K, s) = L(\u03c7, s)L(\u03c7\u0304, s).\n\n(35)\n\nThis result shows that for any elliptic curve with complex multiplication the geometric HasseWeil L-function leads to L-functions associated to algebraic number fields. In the case of the\nFermat curve this number field is the fusion field, determined by the quantum dimensions of\nthe scaling fields of the underlying conformal field theory. Deuring's result shows that this\ncan be generalized to any elliptic curve with complex multiplication.\nThis then leads to the idea that perhaps quite generally for elliptic curves with CM the fusion\nfield of the rational conformal field theory can be obtained via the Hecke L-function interpretation of the Hasse-Weil L-function. We therefore should ask what precisely the underlying\nstructure is that is responsible for the existence of these characters.\n\n13\n\n\f5.2\n\nCharacter construction from elliptic curves\n\nOur goal in this section is to describe the conceptual origin of the Hecke characters that\nappear in Deuring's result, and which turn out to provide one of the links from geometry\nto conformal field theory. Even though its explication is not absolutely necessary for the\nlogic of our argument, it is worthwhile to briefly outline the key elements that facilitate the\ntransition from the elliptic curve to the algebraic Hecke characters, because it illuminates the\nnumber theoretic nature of elliptic curves, and more generally, abelian varieties, with complex\nmultiplication. It is this number theoretic structure that lies at the heart of the results\nobtained so far concerning a direct relation between exactly solvable models and geometric\nstring vacua.\nThe construction is based on the action of the Artin symbols on the points of finite order of the\nabelian variety, and therefore combines both geometric and number theoretic aspects. While\nthe geometric concepts are completely parallel in the 1-dimensional and the higher dimensional\ncase, the transition from elliptic curves to more general abelian varieties introduces a number\nof technical complications that do not help to illuminate the essence of the argument. It is\ntherefore useful to consider first elliptic curves. More details can be found in [24, 25, 26].\nThe starting point of the analysis of the action of the Artin symbol on the torsion points is\nthe main theorem of complex multiplication. Before stating it we review some concepts. Let\nE/K be an elliptic curve over a number field K and let\nf : C/\u039b \u2212\u2192 E \u2297 C\nz\n\n7\u2192\n\n(\u2118(z, \u039b), \u2118\u2032 (z, \u039b))\n\n(36)\n\ndescribe the analytic representation of E\u2297C for a lattice \u039b \u2282 C via the Weierstrass \u2118\u2212function.\n\nSuch a representation always exists according to the uniformization theorem for elliptic curves,\nand hence we obtain a polynomial description, given by the Weierstrass equation\nE : y 2 = 4x3 \u2212 g2 (\u039b)x \u2212 g3 (\u039b).\n\n(37)\n\nAssume that E has complex multiplication by the field F , i.e. there exists an isomorphism\n\u03b8 : F \u2212\u2192 End(E) \u2297 Q.\n\n(38)\n\nIt follows that F must be an imaginary quadratic field (see e.g. [27]). If an elliptic curve has\nCM by a field F then E can be constructed as C/a, where a is a Z\u2212lattice. More precisely,\n14\n\n\fthere is a short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 a \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(39)\n\nDenote by E[m] the set of finite order on E, i.e. the kernel of the multiplication map by m\nE[m] = {z \u2208 E | mz = 0},\n\n(40)\n\nand let Etor denote the torsion points of E, i.e. the collection of all points of arbitrary finite\norder. The analytic parametrization then restricts to a map, also denoted by f ,\nf : F/a \u2212\u2192 Etor .\n\n(41)\n\nArtin symbols are particular elements in the Galois group Gal(Fab /F ) of the maximal abelian\nextension Fab of F . They are most efficiently described in terms of id\u00e8les A\u00d7\nF [28], which we\ncan view as the multiplicative subgroup of the ring of ad\u00e8les AF [29]1 .

Restricted to the extension L the\nmap [x, F ] then is defined as\n\n[x, F ]|L = \u03c3(x) ,\n1\n\nA brief review of ad\u00e8les, id\u00e8les, and class field theory is contained in the appendix.\n\n15\n\n(45)\n\n\fwhere for any prime P of L that divides the prime ideal p of F the Artin symbol \u03c3P is defined\nas\n\u03c3P(x) = xNp mod P.\n\n(46)\n\nThe homomorphism (42) has a nontrivial kernel given by the connected component of the\n\u00d7\nid\u00e8le class group CF = A\u00d7\nF /F .

To answer this question we need a notion of multiplication of a fractional ideal a of F\nby an id\u00e8le x \u2208 A\u00d7\nF . The idea here is to use the fractional ideal (x) constructed from the id\u00e8le\nx and then define the product via this ideal\nxa = (x)a,\n\nx \u2208 A\u00d7\nF , a \u2282 F.\n\n(48)\n\nWe also need the inverse a\u22121 of an ideal a in F , which can be defined as\na\u22121 = {x \u2208 F | xa \u2282 OF }.\n\n(49)\n\nIf we now think of E in terms of its analytic representation C/a with a \u2282 OF , then for any\n\nnon-zero b \u2282 OF we can ask what the action of the ideal (class) does on the elliptic curve,\n\ni.e. we can consider E \u2032 = C/b\u22121 a (here the appearance of the inverse of b is conventional).\nIf, on the other hand, we think of E as defined by a polynomial then we can ask how the\ntransformation of the coefficients in the polynomial affects the curve. This leads to the notion\nof the \u03c3\u2212transform E \u03c3 of an elliptic curve E for automorphisms of C, which is defined via an\naction of the map on the coefficients of the curve. In the case of the Weierstrass representation\n(37) the \u03c3\u2212transform is described by the curve\nE \u03c3 : y 2 = 4x3 \u2212 g2\u03c3 x \u2212 g3\u03c3 .\n\n(50)\n\nThe main result in the theory of complex multiplication for elliptic curves answers the question\nwhat the relation is between these two geometric transformations of an elliptic curve, and what\nthis relation implies for the torsion points.\n16\n\n\fTheorem.

This means that we want\n\nto know what f (v)[x,F ] is.

Robert is foundational because it implies the highlights of the classical\ntheory of complex multiplication, such as the construction of the Hilbert class field, as well as\nthe maximal abelian extension of quadratic imaginary fields (see e.g. [26, 25]). A discussion\nof these standard results in a physical context can be found in [16, 15]. The main ingredient of\nthe proof of this theorem is the Kronecker congruence relation in a form given first by Hasse\n[30]. It states that for an extension L/F the Artin symbol (46) of a prime L \u2283 P|p acts on\n\nthe j\u2212invariant of the elliptic curve as\n\n\u03c3P(j(a)) = j(p\u22121 a).\n\n(56)\n\nThis leads to the rhs of the diagram because the j\u2212invariant is an isomorphism invariant for\nelliptic curves over algebraically closed fields.\n17\n\n\fThe construction of the algebraic Hecke character is now a two-step procedure. The first\ningredient is a map \u03b1 constructed as follows.

Let further F \u00d7 denote the invertible elements\nof F .\nTheorem. Let E/K be an elliptic curve with parametrization\nf : C/a \u2212\u2192 E(C),\n\n(59)\n\nwhere a \u2282 F is a fractional ideal. Assume that E has complex multiplication by the ring of\n\nintegers OF of F , and that F \u2282 K. Then K(Etor ) is abelian over K. Let further x \u2208 A\u00d7\nK\n\nbe an id\u00e8le of K, and y = NK/F x.

But it can be modified in a way such that an\nappropriate character emerges.\nTheorem. Let E/K be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the ring of integers\n18\n\n\fOF of F and assume F \u2282 K. Let\n\u00d7\n\u03b1E/K : A\u00d7\nK \u2212\u2192 F\n\n(61)\n\n\u00d7\nbe the component of x\nbe the map described above. For any id\u00e8le x \u2208 A\u00d7\nF , let x\u221e \u2208 C\n\ncorresponding to the unique archimedean absolute value of F .

Then \u03c8E/K is unramified at P if and only if E has good reduction\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nat P. (A Gross\u0308encharakter \u03c8 : A\u00d7\nK \u2212\u2192 C is said to be unramified at P if \u03c8(OP) = 1.)\n\nIt is the L-function L(\u03c8E/K , s) of this algebraic Hecke character \u03c8E/K which provides the\nnumber theoretic description of the Hasse-Weil L-function described above in eq. (35) (it\ncan be shown that the id\u00e8lic version of the Hecke characters reduces to Deligne's formulation\ndescribed in the first part of this section [31]).\nIn summary, the important conceptual point here is that the arithmetic structure of the torsion\npoints of elliptic curves with complex multiplication carries the essential information which\nturns the geometric L-function into a number theoretic object. It is this number theoretic\nstructure which allows the translation of geometric properties into conformal field theoretic\nobjects (we will return to this aspect further below).\nIn the formulation above we have made the simplifying assumption that the complex multiplication field F is contained in the field of definition K. A similar analysis goes through\nwhen this assumption is dropped, as has been shown by Deuring in the 1950s in his important\nsequence of papers [9], in which he developed the algebraic approach to complex multiplication\nused here (see also [32]). In particular the first paper in this series remains an illuminating\nreference about the relation between these different L-functions up to finitely many primes.\nThe generalization to higher dimensional abelian varieties is possible, but complicated by the\nfact that the number theoretic structure arises from the so-called reflex field of the complex\nmultiplication field F , as will become clear further below.\n19\n\n\f6\n6.1\n\nAbelian varieties\nGeneral definition\n\nWe first review some relevant concepts in the context of abelian varieties. An abelian variety\nover some number field K is a smooth, geometrically connected, projective variety, which is\nalso an algebraic group with the group law A \u00d7 A \u2212\u2192 A defined over K. A concrete way to\n\nconstruct such manifolds is via complex tori Cn /\u039b with respect to some lattice \u039b \u2282 Cn , or,\nput differently, via an exact sequence\n\nf\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u039b \u2212\u2192 Cn \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 0,\n\n(63)\n\nwhere f is a holomorphic map. The lattice \u039b is not necessarily integral and admits a Riemann\nform, which is defined as an IR-bilinear form <, > on Cn such that the following hold:\n(1) < x, y > takes integral values for all x, y \u2208 \u039b;\n\n(2) < x, y >= \u2212 < y, x >;\n\n(3) < x, iy > is a symmetric and positive definite form in x, y.\nThe result then is that a complex torus Cn /\u039b has the structure of an abelian variety if and\nonly if there exists a non-degenerate Riemann form on Cn /\u039b.\n\n6.2\n\nAbelian varieties of CM type\n\nA special class of abelian varieties are those of complex multiplication (CM) type. These\nare varieties which admit automorphism groups that are larger than those of general abelian\nmanifolds. The reason why CM type varieties are special is because certain number theoretic\nquestions can be addressed in a systematic fashion for this class. The first to discover this\nwas Weil [2] in the context of Fermat type hypersurfaces. The fact that this relation can be\ntraced to the property of CM for abelian varieties was first shown by Deuring in the context\nof elliptic curves, following a suggestion by Weil. This was later generalized conditionally\nto higher dimensions by Taniyama and Shimura [33, 34], Serre and Tate [35], and Shimura\n[26, 36].\nConsider a number field F over the rational numbers Q and denote by [F : Q] the degree\nof the field F over Q, i.e. the dimension of F over the subfield Q. An abelian variety A\n20\n\n\fof dimension n is called a CM\u2212variety if there exists an algebraic number field F of degree\n[F : Q] = 2n over the rational numbers Q which can be embedded into the endomorphism\nalgebra End(A) \u2297 Q of the variety. More precisely, a CM-variety is a triplet (A, \u03b8, F ), where\n\u03b8 : F \u2212\u2192 End(A) \u2297 Q\n\n(64)\n\ndescribes the embedding of F . It follows from this that the field F necessarily is a CM field, i.e.\na totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real field. The important ingredient here\nis that the restriction to \u03b8(F ) \u2282 End(A) \u2297 Q is equivalent to the direct sum of n isomorphisms\n\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6n \u2208 Iso(F, C) such that Iso(F, C) = {\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6n , \u03c1\u03c61 , ...., \u03c1\u03c6n }, where \u03c1 denotes complex\nconjugation. These considerations suggest calling the pair (F, {\u03c6i }) a CM-type. In principle\nwe can think of the CM type as an abstract representation defined by some matrix\n\uf8eb \u03c61\n\uf8f6\na\n..\n\uf8f8 , for a \u2208 F,\n.\n\u03a6(a) = \uf8ed\na\u03c6n\n\n(65)\n\nbut in the present context (F, \u03a6 = {\u03c6i }) describes the CM-type of a CM-variety (A, \u03b8, F ).\n\nIt is possible to prescribe the CM structure and construct an abelian variety with that given\nstructure by constructing a diagram of the following form\n0 \u2212\u2192\n\na\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2193\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u039b \u2212\u2192\n\nFR\n\n\u2212\u2192 FR /a \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2193 u\n\n\u2193\n\nCn\n\nf\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nA\n\n0\n(66)\n\n\u2212\u2192 0,\n\nwhere u is the map\nu : FR \u2212\u2192 Cn\n\uf8eb \u03c61 \uf8f6\na\n.. \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n,\na 7\u2192\n.\n\u03c6n\na\n\n(67)\n\ndefined as an R\u2212linear extension on F , and a is the preimage of u of the lattice \u039b. The abelian\nvariety is thereby obtained as the quotient FR /a of FR = F \u2297\u03c1 R, with \u03c1 denoting complex\nconjugation, by an ideal in F , with a complex structure determined by u, and an embedding\n\n\u03b8 : F \u2212\u2192 End(A) \u2297 Q given by (65).\nConcrete examples of these concepts which have been discussed in [4] in the context of the\nCalabi-Yau/conformal field theory relation are varieties which have complex multiplication by\n21\n\n\fa cyclotomic field F = Q(\u03bcn ), where \u03bcn denotes the cyclic group generated by a nontrivial n'th\nroot of unity \u03ben . The degree of Q(\u03bcn ) is given by [Q(\u03bcn ) : Q] = \u03c6(n), where \u03c6(n) = #{m \u2208\n\nIN | m < n, gcd(m, n) = 1} is the Euler function. Hence the abelian varieties encountered\nhave complex dimension dim A = \u03c6(n)/2.\n\nThe simplest examples of abelian CM varieties are elliptic curves with complex multiplication,\nas discussed above. More interestingly for the present context, they occur in the context of\nhigher dimensional Calabi-Yau varieties via the Shioda-Katsura decomposition of the cohomology. Further below we briefly review the reduction of the cohomology of the Brieskorn-Pham\nvarieties to that generated by curves and then analyze the structure of the resulting weighted\ncurve Jacobians.\n\n6.3\n\nL-Function of abelian varieties with complex multiplication\n\nIn this section we describe the generalization of the conceptual framework underlying the\nnumber theoretic interpretation of the zeta function of abelian varieties with complex multiplication. Our goal is to detail the underlying structure that explains this phenomenon. As\nin the case of elliptic curves the main objects that provide the transition from the discrete\ngeometry of the variety to number theory are the torsion points on the abelian variety, i.e.\nthe points in the kernel of a multiplication map n : A \u2212\u2192 A, analogous to the corresponding\nmap on the elliptic curves.\n\nThe general concept of a geometric L-function is derived from the reduction of a variety over\ndiscrete fields IFq of order q. One way to think about this structure is by considering the fields\nIFq as residue fields OK /p, generated by prime ideals p in the ring of integers OK of some\n\nalgebraic number field K. Denoting the residue field produced by p as K(p) and the reduced\nvariety by X(p) one can define the local zeta function as\n\u0001\nZ(X, p, s) := Z X(p)/K(p), t = Np\u2212s .\n\n(68)\n\nBy combining these local zeta functions for all prime ideals one obtains the global zeta function\nY\nZ(X, p, s)\n(69)\nZ(X/K, s) =\np\u2282OK\n\nof the variety X defined over the number field K.\n22\n\n\fWhen the variety has complex multiplication with respect to some number field F the zeta\nfunction admits a number theoretic interpretation which generalizes the results of Deuring for elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\n\nAssociated to the field F are again\n\nGr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere \u03c7i , i = 1, ..., n which lead to Hecke L-functions L(\u03c7i , s). The zeta function of the abelian variety with complex multiplication then is described by these Hecke\nL-functions.\nTheorem. (see [36]) Let the abelian CM-variety (A, \u03b8, F ) be defined over an algebraic number\nfield K of finite degree. Then the zeta function of A over K coincides exactly with the product\nn\nY\n\nL(\u03c7i , s)L(\u03c7\u0304i , s),\n\n(70)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the \u03c7i are Gr\u00f6\u00dfencharaktere, and \u03c7\u0304i is the complex conjugate of \u03c7i .\nThis result was first shown in a conditional formulation by Taniyama and Shimura, and Serre\nand Tate. It shows that if we could recover abelian varieties from Calabi-Yau manifolds then\nwe could generalize to higher dimensions the ideas about the CY/CFT relation formulated in\nthe previous section for elliptic curves.\n\n6.4\n\nCharacter construction from abelian varieties\n\nThe character construction from higher dimensional abelian varieties differs somewhat from\nthat of elliptic curves because of the emergence of the reflex type, denoted here by (F\u0302 , \u03a6\u0302 =\n{\u03c6\u0302i }) of the complex multiplication type (F, \u03a6 = {\u03c6i }). This reflex field is defined by adjoining\nP\nto F all traces determined by the CM type of F , i.e. F\u0302 = F ({ i x\u03c6i | x \u2208 F }). To define\n\nthe reflex type \u03a6\u0302 consider a Galois extension L/Q over the rationals that contains the CM\n\nfield F . Denote by S the subset of all those elements of the Galois group Gal(L/Q) of L that\ninduce some \u03c6i on F and define further\nS \u22121 =\n\n\b \u22121\n\u03c3 |\u03c3\u2208S\n\b\nH = \u03b3 \u2208 Gal(L/Q) | \u03b3S \u22121 = S \u22121 .\n\n(71)\n\nThen the reflex type of (F, \u03a6) is completed by defining the maps\n\u03c6\u0302i : F\u0302 \u2212\u2192 C\n23\n\n(72)\n\n\fas those that are obtained from S \u22121 . In the one dimensional case the discussion simplifies\nbecause one has F\u0302 = F .\nConsider an abelian variety A/K of dimension n defined over a number field K with complex\nmultiplication, i.e. with an embedding \u03b8 : F \u2212\u2192 End(A) \u2297 Q. Denote this structure by\n\n(A/K, \u03b8, F ) with type (F, \u03a6 = {\u03c6i }i=1,...,n). The appearance of F\u0302 leads to a modification of the\nnorm map that appears in the elliptic construction of the character. To simplify the discussion\n\n\u00d7\n: A\u00d7\nwe assume that2 F\u0302 \u2282 K. We can therefore consider the id\u00e8lic norm map NK\nK \u2212\u2192 AF\u0302 ,\nF\u0302\n\ndefined earlier, and compose it with the determinant map\n\u03b4 : A\u00d7\n\u2212\u2192 A\u00d7\nF,\nF\u0302\n\n(73)\n\ndefined as the continuous extension of the determinant of the reflex type\n\u2200x \u2208 F\u0302 \u00d7 .\n\n\u03b4(x) = det \u03a6\u0302(x),\n\n(74)\n\nThe composition g := \u03b4 \u25e6 NK\nof the norm map and the determinant map provides a map from\nF\u0302\nthe K\u2212id\u00e8les to the F \u2212id\u00e8les\n\n\u00d7\ng : A\u00d7\nK \u2212\u2192 AF ,\n\n(75)\n\ngeneralizing the norm map that we encountered in the elliptic case.\nThe construction of the character is based again on the same idea as in the one dimensional\ncase, the action of the id\u00e8lic Artin symbol [x, K] for x \u2208 A\u00d7\nK on the torsion points and the map\n\ng enters this construction in much the same way that the norm map itself did in the earlier\n\ndiscussion. The main result of the theory of complex multiplication in the case of abelian\nvarieties that are relevant to us can be summarized as follows.\nTheorem. Let (F, \u03a6) be a CM-type, (F\u0302 , \u03a6\u0302) its reflex, and a a lattice in F . Let further (A, \u03b8)\nbe of type (F, \u03a6), u : FR \u2212\u2192 Cn the map in the diagram (66), and f the map that defines A\nvia\n\nf\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u039b \u2212\u2192 Cn \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(76)\n\nFurther let \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(C/F\u0302 ), x \u2208 A\u00d7\nbe an id\u00e8le of the reflex field such that\nF\u0302\n\u03c3|F\u0302ab = [x, F\u0302 ],\n2\n\n(77)\n\nThis condition generalizes the assumption in the elliptic case that the CM field is contained in the field\nof definition.\n\n24\n\n\f\u00d7\n: A\u00d7\nand g = \u03b4 \u25e6 NK\nK \u2212\u2192 AF the map defined by the id\u00e8lic extension of the determinant map.\nF\u0302\n\nThen there is an exact sequence\n\nf\u2032\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 u(g(x)\u22121a) \u2212\u2192 Cn \u2212\u2192 A\u03c3 \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(78)\n\nf (u(v))\u03c3 = f \u2032 (u(g(x)\u22121v))\n\n(79)\n\nsuch that\n\u2200v \u2208 F/a,\n\ni.e. there exists a commutative diagram\ng(x)\u22121\n\nF/a\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nF/g(x)\u22121 a\n\u2193 \u03c9\u2032\n\n\u03c9\u2193\n\u03c3\n\nAtor\n\n(80)\n\nA\u03c3tor\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nwhere \u03c9 = f \u25e6 u and \u03c9 \u2032 = f \u2032 \u25e6 u.\nThe construction of the algebraic Hecke character associated to the torsion points of A is now\nagain achieved by constructing an id\u00e8lic map \u03b1 of K in the following way.\nTheorem.

The idea is to first reduce the intermediate cohomology of\nthe Calabi-Yau via the Shioda-Katsura construction to the cohomology spanned by curves\nembedded in the manifold and then to use the results of Faddeev, Gross, Rohrlich, and others\nto decompose the Jacobian varieties derived from these curves to find factors that admit\ncomplex multiplication.\n\n7.1\n\nThe Shioda-Katsura decomposition\n\nThe decomposition of the intermediate cohomology of projective hypersurfaces was first described by Shioda and Katsura [37] and Deligne [38]. Their analysis can be generalized to\nweighted hypersurfaces, in particular the class of Brieskorn-Pham varieties, perhaps the simplest class of exactly solvable Calabi-Yau manifolds. This generalization works because the\ncohomology H3 (X) for these varieties decomposes into the monomial part and the part coming from the resolution. The monomial part of the intermediate cohomology can easily be\nobtained from the cohomology of a projective hypersurface of the same degree by realizing the\nweighted projective space as a quotient variety with respect to a product of discrete groups\ndetermined by the weights of the coordinates.\nFor projective varieties\n\b\nd\nXdn = (z0 , ..., zn+1 ) \u2208 IPn+1 | z0d + * * * + zn+1\n= 0 \u2282 IPn+1\n\n(85)\n\nthe intermediate cohomology can be determined by lower-dimensional varieties in combination\nwith Tate twists by reconstructing the higher dimensional variety Xdn of degree d and dimension n in terms of lower dimensional varieties Xdr and Xds of the same degree with n = r + s.\nBriefly, this works as follows. The decomposition of Xdn is given as\nXdr+s \u223c\n= BZ1 ,Z2\nwhich involves the following ingredients.\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0Y\u22121 (Xdr \u00d7 Xds ) /\u03bcd ,\n\n26\n\n(86)\n\n\f(1) \u03c0Y\u22121 (Xdr \u00d7 Xds ) denotes the blow-up of Xdr \u00d7 Xds along the subvariety\nY = Xdr\u22121 \u00d7 Xds\u22121 \u2282 Xdr \u00d7 Xds .\n\n(87)\n\nThe variety Y is determined by the fact that the initial map which establishes the relation\nbetween the three varieties Xdr+s , Xdr , Xds is defined on the ambient spaces as\n((x0 , ..., xr+1 ), (y0, ..., ys+1 ) 7\u2192 (x0 ys+1 , ..., xr ys+1, xr+1 y0 , ..., xr+1 ys ).\n\n(88)\n\nThis map is not defined on the subvariety Y .\n(2) \u03c0Y\u22121 (Xdr \u00d7 Xds )/\u03bcd denotes the quotient of the blow-up \u03c0Y\u22121 (Xdr \u00d7 Xds ) with respect to the\naction of\n\n\u03bcd \u220b \u03be : ((x0 , ..., xr , xr+1 ), (y0, ..., ys , ys+1 )) 7\u2192 ((x0 , ..., xr , \u03bexr+1 ), (y0 , ..., ys , \u03beys+1)).\n(3) BZ1 ,Z2\nvarieties\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0Y\u22121 (Xdr \u00d7 Xds ) /\u03bcd denotes the blow-down in \u03c0Y\u22121 (Xdr \u00d7 Xds )/\u03bcd of the two subZ1 = IPr \u00d7 Xds\u22121 ,\n\nZ2 = Xdr\u22121 \u00d7 IPs .\n\nThis construction leads to an iterative decomposition of the cohomology which takes the\nfollowing form. Denote the Tate twist by\nHi (X)(j) := Hi (X) \u2297 W \u2297j\n\n(89)\n\nwith W = H2 (IP1 ) and let Xdr+s be a Fermat variety of degree d and dimension r + s. Then\nHr+s (Xdr+s ) \u2295\n\nr\nX\nj=1\n\nHr+s\u22122j (Xdr\u22121 )(j) \u2295\n\ns\nX\n\nHr+s\u22122k (Xds\u22121)(k)\n\nk=1\n\n\u223c\n= Hr+s (Xdr \u00d7 Xds )\u03bcd \u2295 Hr+s\u22122(Xdr\u22121 \u00d7 Xds\u22121 )(1).\n\n(90)\n\nThis allows us to trace the cohomology of higher dimensional varieties to that of curves.\nWeighted projective hypersurfaces can be viewed as resolved quotients of hypersurfaces embedded in ordinary projective space. The resulting cohomology has two components, the invariant\npart coming from the projection of the quotient, and the resolution part. As described in [39],\nthe only singular sets on arbitrary weighted hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefolds are either\npoints or curves. The resolution of singular points contributes to the even cohomology group\nH2 (X) of the variety, but does not contribute to the middle-dimensional cohomology group\n27\n\n\fH 3 (X). Hence we need to be concerned only with the resolution of curves (see e.g. [40]). This\ncan be described for general CY hypersurface threefolds as follows. If a discrete symmetry\ngroup Z/nZ of order n acting on the threefold leaves invariant a curve then the normal bundle\nhas fibres C2 and the discrete group induces an action on these fibres which can be described\nby a matrix\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1mq\n0\n\n0\n\u03b1m\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(91)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an n'th root of unity and (q, n) have no common divisor. The quotient C2 /(Z/nZ)\nby this action has an isolated singularity which can be described as the singular set of the\nsurface in C3 given by the equation\nS = {(z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2208 C3 | z3n = z1 z2n\u2212q }.\n\n(92)\n\nThe resolution of such a singularity is completely determined by the type (n, q) of the action\nby computing the continued fraction of\n\nn\nq\n\nn\n1\n\u2261 [b1 , ..., bs ].\n= b1 \u2212\nq\nb2 \u2212 . 1\n. .\u2212 1\n\n(93)\n\nbs\n\nThe numbers bi specify completely the plumbing process that replaces the singularity and in\nparticular determine the additional generator to the cohomology H\u2217 (X) because the number\nof IP1 s introduced in this process is precisely the number of steps needed in the evaluation\nof\n\nn\nq\n\n= [b1 , ..., bs ]. This can be traced to the fact that the singularity is resolved by a bundle\n\nwhich is constructed out of s + 1 patches with s transition functions that are specified by\nthe numbers bi . Each of these gluing steps introduces a sphere, which in turn supports a\n(1,1)-form. The intersection properties of these 2-spheres are described by Hirzebruch-Jung\ntrees, which for a Z/nZ action is just an SU(n + 1) Dynkin diagram, while the numbers bi\ndescribe the intersection numbers. We see from this that the resolution of a curve of genus\ng thus introduces s additional generators to the second cohomology group H2 (X), and g \u00d7 s\ngenerators to the intermediate cohomology H3 (X).\n\nHence we see that the cohomology of weighted hypersurfaces is determined completely by\nthe cohomology of curves. Because the Jacobian variety is the basic geometric invariant of\na smooth projective curve this says that for weighted hypersurfaces the main cohomological\nstructure is carried by their embedded curves.\n\n28\n\n\f7.2\n\nCohomology of weighted curves\n\nFor smooth algebraic curves C of genus g the de Rham cohomology group H1dR (C) decomposes\n(over the complex number field C) as\nH1dR (C) \u223c\n= H0 (C, \u03a91 ) \u2295 H1 (C, O).\n\n(94)\n\nThe Jacobian J(C) of a curve C of genus g can be identified with\nJ(C) = Cg /\u039b,\nwhere \u039b is the period lattice\n(\u0012\nZ\n\u039b :=\n\n...,\n\n\u03c9i , . . .\n\na\n\n(95)\n\n)\n\n\u0013\n\na \u2208 H1 (C, Z), \u03c9i \u2208 H0 (C, \u03a91 ) ,\n\ni=1,...,g\n\n(96)\n\nwhere the \u03c9i form a basis. Given a fixed point p0 \u2208 C on the curve there is a canonical map\nfrom the curve to the Jacobian, called the Abel-Jacobi map\n\u03a8 : C \u2212\u2192 J(C),\ndefined as\np 7\u2192\n\n\u0012\n\n...,\n\nZ\n\np\n\np0\n\n\u0013\n\u03c9i , . . . mod \u039b.\n\n(97)\n\n(98)\n\nWe are interested in curves of Brieskorn-Pham type, i.e. curves of the form\n\b\nCd = xd + y a + z b = 0 \u2208 IP(1,k,l) [d],\n\n(99)\n\nsuch that a = d/k and b = d/l are positive rational integers. Without loss of generality we\ncan assume that (k, l) = 1.

Similarly we denote by \u03b2 the generator of the action Zl and consider\nthe induced action on the forms \u03c9r,s,t\nZl : \u03c9r,s,t 7\u2192 \u03b2 t\u2212d \u03c9r,s,t.\n\n(107)\n\nAgain we see that the only forms that descend to the quotient are those for which t = 0(mod l).\n\n7.3\n\nAbelian varieties from weighted Jacobians\n\nJacobian varieties in general are not abelian varieties with complex multiplication. The question we can ask, however, is whether the Jacobians of the curves that determine the cohomology of the Calabi-Yau varieties can be decomposed such that the individual factors admit\n30\n\n\fcomplex multiplication by an order of a number field. In this section we show that this is\nindeed the case and therefore we can define the complex multiplication type of a Calabi-Yau\nvariety in terms of the CM types induced by the Jacobians of its curves.\nIt was shown by Faddeev [41]4 that the Jacobian variety J(Cd ) of Fermat curves Cd \u2282 IP2\n\nsplits into a product of abelian factors AOi\nJ(Cd ) \u223c\n=\n\nOi\n\nY\n\nAOi ,\n\n(108)\n\n\u2208I/(Z/dZ)\u00d7\n\nwhere the set I provides a parametrization of the cohomology of Cd , and the sets Oi are orbits\n\nin I of the multiplicative subgroup (Z/dZ)\u00d7 of the group Z/dZ.

Computing the sets W5r,s,t for any of the triplets (r, s, t) shows\nthat the order of these groups is unity, hence all three factors are in fact simple.\nFor the complex multiplication type we find from\nH1,1,3\n= {a \u2208 (ZZ/5ZZ)\u00d7 = {1, 2, 3, 4} | < a > + < a > + < 3a >= 5} = {1, 2}\n5\n\n(137)\n\n= {\u03c31 , \u03c32 } and therefore the complex multiplication type of A1,1,3 is given by\nthat G1,1,3\n5\n(Q(\u03bc5 ), {\u03c6} = {\u03c31 , \u03c32 }).\n\n(138)\n\nThe remaining factors are described in the same way.\nMore explicitly, we can use the maps T5r,s,t to express the differentials of Cd invariant under\nthe action of Gr,s,t\nin terms of the (u, v) coordinates of C5r,s,t and observe their transformation\n5\nbehavior under the map\n(u, v) 7\u2192 (u, \u03be5v).\n\n8.2\n\n(139)\n\nFusion field and quantum dimensions\n\nThe field of complex multiplication derived for the quintic is given by the cyclotomic field Q(\u03bc5 )\n\u221a\nand embedded in this field is the real subfield Q( 5), generated by the elements (\u03be5 + \u03be5\u22121 ). To\n35\n\n\fcompare this to the number field determined by the string we briefly recall some facts about\nthe corresponding Gepner model [46, 47].\nThe underlying exactly solvable model of the quintic threefold is determined by the affine\nKac-Moody algebra SU(2) at conformal level k = 2. The central charge c(k) = 3k/(k + 2) at\nlevel k then leads to c = 9/5, leading to a product of five models to make a theory of total\ncharge c = 9.

The\nconstruction of this group proceeds by first considering p\u2212adic number fields and then pasting\nthese together in such a way that one obtains something that is still manageable.\n\n9.1\n\np\u2212adic numbers\n\nFor rational primes p p\u2212adic number fields are constructed much like the real number field R\nas completion of the rational number field Q with respect to norms | * |p , which are defined for\n\neach rational prime p by noting that each rational number x \u2208 Q can be written as x =\n\nm r\np\nn\n\nfor some r \u2208 N and m, n \u2208 Z. The exponent r is called the order ordp x = r of x at p, and\n\none writes |x|p = pordp x . In order to introduce a common language one calls the norms for the\n\nreals and the complex numbers the norms of the 'infinite primes' (for no particularly good\nreason). More precisely, consider an algebraic number field K with degree [K : Q] = r1 + 2r2 ,\nits real embeddings {\u03c31 }i=1,...,r1 , and its complex embeddings {\u03c3r1 +i , \u03c3\u0304r1 +i }i=1,...,r2 . Then for\neach real \u03c3i one defines a valuation on K via\n\n|x|\u03c3i = |x\u03c3i |,\n\n(148)\n\nwhere x\u03c3i denotes the action of \u03c3i on x \u2208 K. For the complex embeddings define the valuation\nas\n\n|x|\u03c3r1 +i = x\u03c3i x\u03c3\u0304i .\n\n(149)\n\nThese valuations satisfy the archimedean inequality and are therefore called archimedean.\nThey define a metric with respect to which K is a topological field, and one can consider\nthe completions, denoted by K\u221e,i , of K with respect to these valuations. This proceeds in\ncomplete analogy to the construction of the real number field as the completion of the rational\nnumber field with respect to the standard norm.\nThis construction can be generalized to other number fields via valuations derived from the\nfinite primes, i.e. prime ideals p \u2282 OK \u2282 K, where OK denotes the ring of algebraic integers\nin K. Define for any x \u2208 K the valuation | * |p as\n\n|x|p = Np\u2212ordp x ,\n37\n\n(150)\n\n\fwhere Np = #(OK /p) is the norm of the ideal p, and ordpx is the power to which the ideal\np occurs in the factorization of the principal ideal (x). Each such valuation again defines\na metric on K, dp = |x \u2212 y|p, and one can again consider the completion with respect to\n\nthis metric, denoted by Kp. The multiplicative subgroup is denoted by Kp\u00d7 , and the ring of\nintegers in this field is defined by\nOp = {y \u2208 Kp | |y|p \u2264 1} ,\n\n(151)\n\nwhile its group of units is given as\nOp\u00d7 = {y \u2208 Kp | |y|p = 1} .\n\n9.2\n\n(152)\n\nAd\u00e8les and id\u00e8les\n\nIt is often useful in number theory to consider an embedding of a number field of degree\nn = r1 + 2r2 into a vector space spanned by its completions with respect to the standard\nmetric ( [4] contains an application in a physical context). Given the completions of K with\nrespect to finite and infinite primes, it makes sense to try and put them all together into a\nQ\nsingle large product p Kp that combines all of them. It turns out that this object is too\n\nlarge, and that it is more useful to define the ring of ad\u00e8les AK of the field K to be the subset\n\ndefined by a restricted product, consisting of all elements x = (xp) such that xp is a p\u2212adic\ninteger for all but finitely many non-archimedean valuations | * |p\nAK = {(xp) | xp \u2208 Kp \u2200p, x \u2208 Op for all but finitely many p} .\n\n(153)\n\nPut somewhat differently, consider a set S of primes that contains the infinite ones. Then we\ncan construct the ring\nASK =\n\nY\n\np\n\n\u2208\n/S\n\nOp\n\nY\n\nKq,\n\n(154)\n\nq\u2208S\n\nwhere the multiplication is understood to be component wise. For S \u2282 S \u2032 there is an injection\nAS \u2212\u2192 AS \u2032 and one can define\n\nAK = lim ASK .\nS\n\n(155)\n\nEmbedded within the ad\u00e8les is the multiplicative subgroup A\u00d7\nK called the id\u00e8les. These were\noriginally introduced by Chevalley [28], independently of the later notion of ad\u00e8les [29], and\n38\n\n\fcan be described in a way completely analogous to the ad\u00e8les as\n\b\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nA\u00d7\nK = (xp) | xp \u2208 Kp \u2200p, x \u2208 Op for all but finitely many p .\n\n(156)\n\nAddition and multiplication in the ad\u00e8les and id\u00e8les are understood to be component wise.\nIf K/F is a finite extension then one can define an id\u00e8lic norm map\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nNK\nF : AK \u2212\u2192 AF\n\n(157)\n\nwhich is determined by specifying what the v\u2212th component is of the image id\u00e8le, where v\ndescribes either the finite of infinite primes. For x \u2208 A\u00d7\nK one sets\nY\n\u0001\nw\nNK\nx\n=\nNK\nF\nFv xw ,\nv\n\n(158)\n\nw|v\n\nwhere the product is over all w which contain v, and Kw , Fv denote the completions of K and\nF with respect to the norms defined by w and v respectively.\n\n9.3\n\nClass field theory\n\nClass field theory deals with the behavior of primes in number fields K when K is embedded\nin finite extensions L/K. For simple fields such as quadratic extensions of the rationals this\nbehavior is controlled by the Legendre symbol. For more complicated fields the Artin symbol\nprovides an appropriate generalization.\nConsider a finite number field extension L/K that is Galois and an ideal P \u2282 OL in the ring\n\nof integers OL of L that divides the prime ideal p \u2282 OK . The Artin symbol is then\n\u0011\n\u0010 defined\n, for\nas the element \u03c3P of the Galois group Gal(L/K), often denoted by (P, L/K), or L/K\nP\n\nwhich\n\n\u03c3p(x) = xNp mod P.\n\n(159)\n\nIt is a multiplicative function on the primes\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL/K\n: I(L) \u2212\u2192 Gal(L/K)\n*\nand therefore can be defined for any ideal A \u2282 OL via the prime decomposition A =\n\u0012\n\u0013 Y\u0012\n\u0013\nL/K\nL/K\n=\n.\nA\nP\ni\ni\n39\n\n(160)\nQ\n\nPi as\n(161)\n\n\fWhen the extension L/K is abelian the Artin symbol is independent of the prime P chosen\nabove p and depends only on p.\nThe id\u00e8lic formulation of class field theory aims at an efficient discussion of all abelian extensions at the same time.\nTheorem. Let K be a number field and Kab be the maximal abelian extension of K. There\nexists a unique continuous homomorphism, called the reciprocity map\nA\u00d7\nK \u2212\u2192 Gal(Kab /K)\nx\n\n7\u2192\n\n[x, K],\n\n(162)\n\nwith the property that if L/K is a finite abelian extension, x \u2208 A\u00d7\nK an id\u00e8le whose ideal (x) is\n\nnot divisible by any primes that ramify in L, then\n\n(1) [x, K]L = ((x), L/K) is the Artin symbol of the ideal (x).\n2) The reciprocity map is compatible with the norm map: if L is a finite abelian extension of\nK then\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[x, L]|Kab = NLK x, K ,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 A\u00d7\nL.\n\n(163)\n\nAcknowledgement\nIt is a pleasure to thank Jack Morse for correspondence.
