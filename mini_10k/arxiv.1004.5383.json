INTRODUCTION\n\nMost modern higher-dimensional theories venturing beyond the standard model of particle physics contain the fairly\ngeneric feature that the low-energy fundamental constants\nshould vary with time. The detection of such changes opens\nup an avenue to probe basic physics, especially important because other predictions of these models tend to lie at unattainably high energies (& 1019 GeV). Tests of such low-energy\npredictions of these models, such as changes in the constants,\nviolation of the equivalence principles, etc, may provide the\nonly means of distinguishing between different unified theories and are hence of much importance in physics.\nAstrophysical techniques can be used to probe changes in\nfundamental constants like the fine structure constant \u03b1, the\nproton-electron mass ratio \u03bc \u2261 m p /me and the proton gyromagnetic ratio g p , over a large fraction of the age of the\nUniverse (e.g. Savedoff 1956; Wolfe et al. 1976; Thompson\n1975; Dzuba et al. 1999; Chengalur & Kanekar 2003). Indeed, Murphy et al. (2004) applied one such technique (the\n\"many-multiplet method\"; Dzuba et al. 1999) to High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph\n\u0002\n\u0003 (HIRES) data from the Keck telescope to obtain \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22125.7 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u22126 from 143 absorbers at 0.2 < z < 4.2, i.e. suggesting a smaller value of\n\u03b1 at earlier times (see also Murphy et al. 2003). This result has not so far been confirmed with independent data on\nsmaller samples from the Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph\n(UVES) on the Very Large Telescope (e.g. Molaro et al.\n2008; Srianand et al. 2007; Murphy et al. 2008b. More recently, King et al. (2008) used redshifted molecular hydrogen\n(H2 ) lines\nstrong constraints on changes in \u03bc, ob\u0002 to place\n\u0003\ntaining \u2206\u03bc/\u03bc = (\u22122.6 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10\u22126 from three absorbers at\nz \u223c 2.8. Note that these results are all based on optical spectra,\n1 Ramanujan Fellow, National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, TIFR,\nPune 411 007, India; National Radio Astronomy Observatory, 1003\nLopezville Road, Socorro, NM 87801, USA; nkanekar@ncra.tifr.res.in\n2 National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, TIFR, Pune 411 007, India\n3 Arecibo Observatory, HC03 Box 53995, Arecibo, PR 00612, USA\n\nwhere wavelength calibration, line blending, intrinsic velocity\noffsets, isotopic abundances, interloping absorbers, etc, are\nall possible sources of systematic error, (e.g. Murphy et al.\n2003; Griest et al. 2010). Further, the quoted errors in the\nresult of Murphy et al. (2004) do not include effects from\nsystematic distortions in the HIRES wavelength calibration\n(Griest et al. 2010); similar, but smaller, distortions have also\nbeen found in the wavelength scale of the VLT-UVES spectrograph (Centurion et al. 2009; Whitmore et al. 2010).\nGiven the possibility that underestimated or unknown systematics might dominate the errors from a given technique, it\nis important that independent techniques, with entirely different systematics, be used to test for changes in the constants.\nIt is also crucial to probe evolution at all timescales, as the\ntimescales of the putative changes are entirely unknown. Redshifted radio OH lines provide an independent approach to\nstudy changes in \u03b1, \u03bc and g p (Chengalur & Kanekar 2003;\nDarling 2003; Kanekar & Chengalur 2004). In rare cases, the\nsatellite OH 18cm lines (at rest frequencies of 1612.230825\n(15) MHz and 1720.529887 (10) MHz; Lev et al. 2006) are\n\"conjugate\" to each other; i.e. the lines have the same shapes,\nbut one line is in absorption and the other in emission. This\nmasing effect arises due to the quantum mechanical selection\nrules for decay routes to the 2\u03a03/2 (J = 3/2) OH ground state,\nafter the molecules have been pumped to higher excited rotational states (Elitzur 1992). Crucially, the conjugate behavior\nensures that the satellite lines arise from the same gas. These\nlines are thus well-suited for measuring changes in \u03b1, \u03bc and\ng p between the source redshift and today, as systematic velocity offsets between the lines are ruled out by the maser\nmechanism. Any observed difference between the line redshifts must then arise due to a change in one or more of the\nabove constants (Kanekar 2008).\nOnly two conjugate OH systems are known at cosmological distances, at z \u223c 0.247 towards PKS 1413+135\n(Kanekar et al. 2004; Darling 2004) and at z \u223c 0.765 towards\nPMN J0134\u22120931 (Kanekar et al. 2005). We report here\non deep Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and\n\n\f2\n\nKanekar et al.\n\nArecibo Telescope (AO) OH observations of PKS 1413+135,\nthat yield tentative evidence for changes in \u03b1, \u03bc and/or g p over\na lookback time of \u223c 2.9 Gyr.\n2. SPECTRA AND RESULTS\n\nThe WSRT and the AO were used to carry out deep\nintegrations on the satellite OH lines of PKS 1413+135\nbetween May and July 2005 (WSRT; \u223c 58 hours) and\nJune 2008 and May 2009 (AO; \u223c 40 hours in double-positionswitched mode; (Ghosh & Salter 2002)). The 1720 MHz\nand 1612 MHz lines were observed simultaneously in all\nruns, with velocity resolutions of \u223c 0.35 km/s (AO) and\n\u223c 0.57 km/s (WSRT), after Hanning smoothing. The WSRT\ndata were analysed in \"classic\" AIPS, while the Arecibo data\nwere analysed in IDL, both using standard procedures.\nThe top four panels of Fig. 1[A] and [B] show the satellite OH 18cm optical depth spectra from each telescope, with\nthe 1720 MHz spectrum flipped in sign for the comparison. The WSRT spectra of Fig. 1[A] have root-mean-square\n(RMS) optical depth noise values of 8.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 (1612) and\n8.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 (1720), per \u223c 0.57 km/s channel, while the corresponding RMS noise values for the AO spectra of Fig. 1[B]\nare 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 (1612) and 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 (1720), per \u223c 0.35 km/s\nchannel. The bottom panels of the figure show the sum of\nthe 1612 and 1720 MHz optical depth profiles from each telescope. The RMS noise values on the summed spectra are \u223c\n1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 per \u223c 0.57 km/s channel (WSRT) and \u223c 6.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\nper \u223c 0.35 km/s channel (AO), consistent with the noise levels\non the individual spectra. The summed spectra also show no\nevidence for non-Gaussian structure; indeed, a KolmogorovSmirnov (K-S) rank-1 test finds that the summed spectra are\nconsistent (at \u2264 1.3\u03c3 significance) with being drawn from\nnormal distributions. The satellite OH lines are thus conjugate at the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations.\nHaving confirmed that the satellite lines are conjugate\nwithin our measurement errors, the next step is to test whether\nthey arise at the same redshift. For lines that are not conjugate, this is usually done by fitting Gaussians (or Voigt profiles) to each line, to measure the redshift of peak absorption\n(e.g. Murphy et al. 2003; Srianand et al. 2007; Kanekar et al.\n2005). In the case of the WSRT and AO spectra, a threecomponent Gaussian model provides a good fit to each spectrum, yielding noise-like residuals. However, the process of\nfitting multiple spectral components to a spectral line of shape\ncan itself affect the results, especially in the case of complex\nprofiles. An important advantage of using conjugate satellite OH lines to probe fundamental constant evolution is that\nthe shapes of the lines are known to be the same. One can\nthus directly determine the peak of the cross-correlation of the\ntwo lines, instead of having to decompose each profile into its\ncomponents. The cross-correlation of the two WSRT satellite\nOH spectra was found to peak at \u2206V = (\u22120.37 \u00b1 0.22) km/s,\nand that of the AO spectra at \u2206V = (\u22120.20 \u00b1 0.10) km/s.\nThe RMS noise values were estimated by cross-correlating\n104 pairs of simulated spectra. Each simulated spectrum was\nobtained by adding independent representations of Gaussian\nrandom noise to the best 3-component fit, with the noise spectra characterized by the RMS values of the observed spectra.\nA weighted average of the WSRT and AO results gives a net\nvelocity offset of (\u22120.23 \u00b1 0.09) km/s between the two satellite lines, with the 1720 MHz line at a higher velocity.\nNote that the sum of the optical depth spectra might be expected to approach zero more closely (i.e. to be more \"noise-\n\nlike\") on applying the measured offset between the line profiles. At present, the fact that the measured offset is smaller\nthan a pixel (\u223c half a pixel for the Arecibo spectra) implies\nthat this test is not very sensitive, especially because the offset\nis detected at relatively low statistical significance. Note, further, that a K-S test finds that the summed optical depth spectra, obtained without applying the velocity offset, are consistent with noise (at \u2264 1.3\u03c3 significance). However, we did\ncarry out the above test on the higher-sensitivity Arecibo spectra, and found, as expected, that no statistically-significant\ndifference is apparent in either the mean or the RMS noise\nof the summed spectrum, on applying the measured velocity\noffset before carrying out the sum. Finally, we emphasize that\nthis would be a useful test to carry out on higher-sensitivity,\nhigher-resolution data, to test for an offset of multiple pixels. This test would also verify that the two lines indeed\nhave precisely the same shape, thus complementing the crosscorrelation technique, which formally only measures the offset between the two profiles, assuming that they have the same\nshape.\nThe above agreement between the shapes (amplitudes and\nwidths) of the satellite lines of Fig. 1 and the offset between\nthe line redshifts is precisely the signature of an evolution\nin the fundamental constants that was being sought. Using the equations of Chengalur & Kanekar (2003), the velocity\nanalysis yield\n\u0002 offsets\n\u0003 measured in the cross-correlation\n\u22125\n\u2206G/G\n=\n(\u22121.9\n\u00b1\n1.1)\n\u00d7\n10\nfor\nthe\nWSRT\nspectra, and\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22125\n\u2206G/G = (\u22121.03 \u00b1 0.51) \u00d7 10 for the AO spectra, where\n\u0002\n\u00031.85\nG \u2261 g p \u03bc\u03b12 \u0002 . A \u0003weighted average of the WSRT and AO\nresults gives \u2206G/G = (\u22121.18 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7 10\u22125. This is weak\n(\u223c 2.6\u03c3) evidence for a change in \u03b1, \u03bc and/or g p , from the\nredshift of PKS 1413+135 to the present epoch, i.e. over\n2.9 Gyrs.\nWe also carried out a similar cross-correlation analysis\non the strong conjugate satellite OH lines from the nearby\nextra-galactic source Cen.A (van Langevelde et al. 1995), to\ntest whether velocity offsets between the satellite lines are\nseen in local conjugate systems. The analysed OH spectra towards this source were kindly provided to us by Huib\nvan Langevelde. The peak of the cross-correlation for the\nCen.A spectra was found to be at \u2206V = (+0.05 \u00b1 0.11) km/s,\nconsistent with no velocity offset between the lines. This\ndemonstrates that the conjugate satellite technique provides\nthe expected null result for at least one local system, and\nat a sensitivity comparable to that of the datasets towards\nPKS 1413+135.\n3. SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS\n\nSystematic effects that might contribute to increased errors,\nabove those determined from the cross-correlation analysis,\nstem from two possible sources. \"Local\" issues that could\nresult in an observed offset include errors in the telescope\nfrequency scale, doppler-tracking issues, terrestrial radio frequency interference (RFI), etc. However, both the WSRT\nand AO data were recorded in topocentric frequency, with no\ncorrections made for Earth motion during the observations.\nThese corrections were applied during the data analysis, using a model of Earth motion accurate to < 15 m/s, an order\nof magnitude lower than our measurement errors. Frequency\ncalibration is also not usually an issue in radio spectroscopy,\nwith the frequency scale set by the accuracy of masers and\nlocal oscillators (typically a few Hz, two orders of magnitude lower than our errors). The laboratory OH frequencies\n\n\fFundamental constant evolution with conjugate-satellite OH lines\n\n3\n\nF IG . 1.- Top panels: WSRT and AO satellite OH spectra towards PKS 1413+135, with optical depth (1000 \u00d7 \u03c4 ) plotted against heliocentric velocity, in km/s,\nrelative to z = 0.24671. The 1612 and 1720 MHz spectra are plotted using open circles and triangles, respectively, with the 1720 MHz spectrum flipped in sign.\nBottom panels: The sum of the 1612 and 1720 MHz optical depth spectra from each telescope.\n\nare known to an accuracy of \u223c 15 Hz (Lev et al. 2006), again\nfar smaller than our errors. Finally, there is no evidence for\nnon-Gaussian structure in the baselines of the different spectra, that might limit their dynamic range. The only \"local\"\nsource of systematic error in this technique thus appears to be\nRFI; the WSRT and AO data were carefully edited and there\nwas no evidence of residual RFI in any of the spectra. Further,\nnote that a consistent velocity offset between the satellite lines\nis found in both the WSRT and AO spectra, although the two\ndatasets were acquired with telescopes on different continents\nand at different times; this makes it very unlikely that the offset might be caused by RFI.\nAnother category of systematics consists of \"astronomical\"\neffects that might cause intrinsic velocity offsets between the\ntwo lines (e.g. different \"clouds\" excited in each line, source\ninhomogeneities, an interloping line from a different transition, etc). However, unlike in the optical regime, there is no\npossibility of \"confusing\" lines from PKS 1413+135 or an\ninterloper along the line of sight. All possible line interlopers at these frequencies are weak and only detectable in very\nhigh HI column density gas, requiring a sightline through a\ngalaxy. The relatively-large AO beam intersects three known\ngalaxies, the Milky Way, the host galaxy of PKS 1413+135\n(at z \u223c 0.24671) and SDSS J141557.20+131851.2, a galaxy at\nz \u223c 0.3687; there are no transitions from any of these redshifts\nthat might be blended with the OH satellite lines. For example, the nearest known Galactic lines are those of CH2 CHCN,\nat a frequency of \u223c 1371.7 MHz, \u223c 8.3 MHz away from the\nredshifted 1720 MHz frequency, while the closest known lines\nfrom z \u223c 0.24671 are those of CH3 OCHO, \u223c 1.0 MHz away\nfrom the redshifted 1612 MHz line frequency. Finally, we\nnote that the separation between transitions from different OH\nisotopes at these frequencies is & 50 MHz, much larger than\nour observing bandwidth.\nThe strongest argument against intrinsic velocity offsets,\nRFI, or additional spectral lines, playing a significant role is\n\nthe fact that the shapes of the satellite lines are in excellent\nagreement, in both WSRT and AO datasets. This is a crucial\ndifference between the present technique, based on the conjugate satellite OH lines, and other approaches. Here, the observed lines themselves provide a stringent test of their use as\na probe of fundamental constant evolution: the maser mechanism giving rise to the lines (Elitzur 1992) implies that the\nline shapes must agree if they arise in the same gas.\nIt should also be pointed out that the satellite line shapes\nonly agree at our present sensitivity. An additional weak spectral component might be present in one of the two spectra,\nbelow our detection threshold; this could result in the crosscorrelation peak being offset from zero velocity, while retaining the conjugate behaviour. While we cannot as yet formally\nrule out this possibility, it should be emphasized that this can\neasily be tested by deeper spectra in the satellite OH lines.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nIf the observed (\u223c 2.6\u03c3 significance) offset between the\nsatellite lines is not caused by a \"hidden\" spectral component (or RFI) below our sensitivity threshold, it could be evidence for changes in one or more of \u03b1, \u03bc, or g p . Note\nthat the conjugate satellite technique is directly sensitive to\n\u0002\n\u00031.85\n, and cannot provide additional\nchanges in G \u2261 g p \u03bc\u03b12\ninformation on which constant is changing. Our present\nresult\n\u00d7 10\u22125 implies the relation\n\u0002 \u2206G/G\n\u0003 = (\u22121.18\n\u0002 \u00b1 0.46)\n\u0003\n3.7 \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 + 1.85 \u2206\u03bc/\u03bc + [\u2206g p /g p ] = (\u22121.18 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7\n10\u22125 , suggesting that one or more of \u03b1, \u03bc and g p had smaller\nvalues at z = 0.247 than at the present epoch. The limiting \u0002cases, assuming\nthat only one of \u03b1,\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u03bc, and\n\u0003 g p \u0002changes,\n\u0003\nare \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 \u0002= (\u22123.1\u0003\u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22126 (for \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 >>\n\u2206\u03bc/\u03bc\n,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22126\n[\u2206g\n/g\n]),\n\u2206\u03bc/\u03bc\n=\n(\u22126.2\n\u00b1\n2.4)\n\u00d7\n10\n(for\n\u2206\u03bc/\u03bc\n>>\n\u0002 p \u0003p\n\u22125\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 , [\u2206g p /g p ]),\n\u0002 and \u0003[\u2206g\n\u0002 p /g p ]\u0003= (\u22121.18 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7 10\n(for [\u2206g p /g p ] >> \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 , \u2206\u03bc/\u03bc ).\nChanges in g p are expected to be far smaller than those in\n\n\f4\n\nKanekar et al.\n\n\u03bc and \u03b1 (Langacker et al. 2002). Further, a stringent constraint on changes in \u03bc from a higher redshift absorber has\nrecently been obtained from comparisons between NH3 inver+\nsion \u0002and HCN/HCO\nrotational lines: Murphy et al. (2008a)\n\u0003\nfind \u2206\u03bc/\u03bc < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 (2\u03c3) from a gravitational lens at\nz \u223c 0.685. This suggests that changes in G \u2261 g p [\u03bc\u03b12 ]1.85 at\nz \u223c 0.25 may be dominated\u0002by changes\nin \u03b1, i.e. the first lim\u0003\n\u22126\niting case above, yielding \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\u0002 = (\u22123.1\n\u0003 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10 . It\nis interesting that this result for \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1\nin both\n\u0002 is similar\n\u0003\namplitude and sign to the value of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 obtained by\nMurphy et al. (2004)\nusing\nthe many-multiplet method at a\n\u0002\n\u0003\nhigher redshift, \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22125.7 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u22126 at hzi = 1.75.\nOther sensitive astronomical techniques to probe fundamental constant evolution include those based on the manymultiplet method (Murphy et al. 2004), H2 lines (King et al.\n2008), H I 21cm and OH lines (Kanekar et al. 2005), inversion\nand rotational lines (Flambaum & Kozlov 2007), H I 21cm\nand ultraviolet carbon lines (Kanekar et al. 2010), etc. All\nof these are affected by systematic effects of different types\n(e.g. Kanekar 2008). For example, Griest et al. (2010)\nhave recently shown that Keck-HIRES spectra are affected\nby wavelength calibration errors of unknown origin; the effect of these systematic errors on the many-multiplet result\nof Murphy et al. (2004) is not known, although it seems clear\nthat the error budget will increase. Similar problems have\nbeen found with VLT-UVES spectra (e.g. Centurion et al.\n2009; Whitmore et al. 2010), which would affect the H2 results of King et al. (2008).\nThe importance of the conjugate satellite OH technique\nstems from the fact that it has fewer systematic effects than\nother approaches and allows a test of its own applicability, in\nthe prediction that the shapes of the satellite OH lines must be\nthe same. We have also demonstrated that the expected null\nresult is obtained on applying the technique to a local conjugate satellite system, Cen.A. Equally important, and again\nunlike most other techniques, the conjugate satellite lines allow an estimate of changes in the fundamental constants from\n\na single space-time location, without any averaging over multiple absorbers (which, for example, is essential in the manymultiplet method to average out local systematics). The only\napparent drawback to the technique is the possibility of RFI at\nthe line frequencies; this can be ameliorated by using multiple\ntelescopes, as done here, or multiple observing epochs, taking\nadvantage of the shift in the line frequency in the terrestrial\nframe due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun.\nIn summary, we have obtained deep WSRT and Arecibo\nTelescope spectra in the redshifted satellite OH 18cm lines\nfrom PKS 1413+135, at z \u223c 0.247. The lines are conjugate\nat our sensitivity, with the sum of the optical depths consistent with noise. We find that the peak of the cross-correlation\nof the satellite OH 18cm lines is offset from zero velocity (at\n\u223c 2.6\u03c3 significance), tentative evidence for a redshift offset\nbetween them. We have examined the data for systematic effects and find no evidence that such effects might give rise\nto the observed velocity offset. We have also verified that\nthe cross-correlation of the satellite OH 18cm lines in the local conjugate satellite system in Cen.A peaks at zero velocity,\nwithin the errors. The observed offset in satellite line redshifts\nin PKS 1413+135 implies \u2206G/G = (\u22121.18 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nwhere G \u2261 g p [\u03bc\u03b12 ]1.85 , suggesting that one or more of \u03b1, \u03bc,\nand g p had smaller values at z \u223c 0.247 than at the present\nepoch.\nWe thank Huib van Langevelde for providing us the conjugate satellite spectra towards Cen.A, Carlos Martins for stimulating discussions, and Rene Vermeulen and Chris Salter\nfor much help with the WSRT and AO observations.
