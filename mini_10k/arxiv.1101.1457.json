Formed by stacking two monolayer graphene (MLG) in Bernal stacking, Bilayer\ngraphene has four inequivalent sites in each unit cell, including A1 and B1 atoms on the top layer and A2 and B2\natoms on the bottom layer. The distance a between A1 and B1 is about 0.142 nm and the vertical separation of the\ntwo layers d is about 0.334 nm. On its band structure side, around the point where the conduction and valence band\ntouch, BLG has a quadratic energy dispersion [1] similar to the regular two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) but its\nlow-energy effective Hamiltonian is chiral without bandgap similar to the MLG. Another unique feature of BLG is\nthat a widely tunable bandgap can realize conveniently by introducing an electrostatic potential bias between the up\nand bottom layer [1, 4\u20138].\nThe magnetic susceptibility of electronic systems comes from two contribution: One is Pauli paramagnetism which\nstems from spin polarization; The other is Landau diamagnetism which stems from the circulation of orbital currents.\nThe orbital diamagnetism of carbon systems has attracted the interest of both experimental and theoretical physicists\nfor a long time. It was firstly found by Krishnan [9] that the diamagnetic susceptibility of the bulk graphite is large and\nanisotropic. McClure [10] showed it arises from the Landau quantization of 2D massless Dirac fermions, which results\nin a delta function peak at zero energy in the orbital diamagnetism of graphite. After the experimentally fabrication\nof graphene, a great deal of works have concerned about the orbital magnetism of graphene-related systems, such\nas nodal fermions [11], disordered graphene [12\u201314], few-layered graphene [15\u201317], graphene in nonuniform magnetic\nfield [18, 19]. Quite recently, novel paramagnetic susceptibility has been found in MLG and BLG with bandgap [20]\nand doped graphene to the first order in the Coulomb interaction [21].\nSafran [22], Koshino and Ando [15] have derived the analytical expression of orbital susceptibility \u03c7(0) for bilayer\ngraphene, but their results are just limited to the case of zero wave number. In this article we generalize them to\ngeneral cases and analytically study the orbital diamagnetism of a weak-doped BLG (i.e., the Fermi energy \u01ebF is much\nsmaller than the interlayer hopping energy.) in nonuniform magnetic fields.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the effective Hamiltonian of bilayer graphene and its corresponding\neigenstates and eigenenergies are introduced. In Sec. III, the orbital susceptibility of bilayer graphene is studied. In\nSec. IV, we investigate and discuss the responses of bilayer graphene to several specific external magnetic field. The\nconclusion is given in Sec.

For\ncomparing the wave number-dependent behaviors of susceptibility of the MLG, BLG and 2DEG systems, we provide\nbelow the finite wave number susceptibility of MLG and 2DEG, which has been given in Ref.[18],\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ns\n\u0012\n\u00132\nge2 v 1\n2k\n2k\n2\n2k\n2\nF\nF\nF\uf8fb\n\u03c7(q; \u01ebF ) = \u2212\n1\u2212\n\u2212 sin\u22121\n\u03b8(q \u2212 2kF ) \uf8f01 +\n(f or M LG),\n(24)\n16 q\n\u03c0 q\nq\n\u03c0\nq\nge2\n\u03c7(q; \u01ebF ) =\n24\u03c0m\n\n\"\u0012\n\n4k 2\n1 \u2212 2F\nq\n\n\u00133/2\n\n\u03b8(q \u2212 2kF ) \u2212 1\n\n#\n\n(f or 2DEG).\n\n(25)\n\nAt q = 0, the susceptibility of BLG \u2212\u03c7(0, \u01ebF ) \u221d log(\u2206/\u01ebF ) is rather different from that of MLG, where \u2212\u03c7(0, \u01ebF ) \u221d\n\u03b4(\u01ebF ), and 2DEG, where \u2212\u03c7(0, \u01ebF ) \u221d 1. By comparing their diverging behaviors, it can be found that the BLG in\nsome sense shows an intermediate behavior between the MLG and 2DEG.

In contrast to the MLG, the susceptibility of BLG has no singular behavior at q = 2kF ,\nand it is continuous as well as its first derivative. For large q, especially for q \u226b 2kF , \u2212\u03c7(q) of BLG rapidly approaches\nthe curve of Eq.

Due to having the same parabolic energy dispersion in the low\nenergy limit, susceptibility of Bilayer graphene and 2DEG share the same term ge2 (1 \u2212 4kF2 /q 2 )3/2 \u03b8(q \u2212 2kF )/(24\u03c0m).\n4.\n\nRESPONSES TO SPECIFIC EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nNow we study the responses of bilayer graphene to different types of magnetic field. First let us consider the case of\na neutral BLG (i.e., \u01ebF = 0) under a sinusoidal magnetic field B(r) = B0 cos qxez . Defining \u03c7(q) \u2261 \u03c7(q, \u01ebF = 0), we\nhave the induced magnetization m(r) = \u03c7(q)B(r), the induced current j(r) = q\u03c7(q)B0 sin qxey , and the z component\nof induced counter magnetic field on BLG\nBind (r) = \u2212\u03b1g (q)B(r),\n\n(27)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nge2 q\nq\n1\n\u03b1g (q) = \u2212\nlog\n.\n+\n2m\n2\u039b 3\n\n(28)\n\nwith the magnetic field screening factor\n\nWhen q \u2192 0, we have \u03b1g (q) \u2192 0; i.e., under a constant magnetic field there is no counter magnetic field on BLG,\nwhich is different from that of MLG. In MLG, the magnetic field screening factor is fixed and independent of q and\nthe specific form of external field, the induced magnetic field above the graphene layer is simply equivalent to the field\nof a mirror image of the original object reflected with respect to the graphene layer but reduced by \u03b1g [18]. However,\nthis argument does not fit for the case of BLG, since the magnetic field screening factor of BLG is dependent of q and\ncomplicated.\nNext we consider the case of a line current I flowing along the +y direction above the BLG, and passing through\nthe point (0, 0, d) (d > 0). The z component of the magnetic field on BLG is B(r) = \u22122Ix/(x2 + d2 ). For \u01ebF = 0,\nthe induced magnetization can be given as\n\u0015\n\u0014\np\nx\nx\n1\nIge2\nd\n2 + d2 ) +\n,\n(29)\nlog(2\u039b\narctan\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n+\nm(r) = \u2212\nx\nE\n2\u03c0m x2 + d2\nx\nd\n3\n\nhere \u03b3E \u2248 0.577 is the Euler constant. By using jind = \u2207\u00d7m(r), we obtain the induced electric current jind (r) = jy ey ,\nwhere\n\u0015\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u001b\np\nIge2\n1\nx\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\njy =\n\u2212 2dx arctan + (x + d ) .\n(d \u2212 x ) log(2\u039b x + d ) \u2212 \u03b3E +\n(30)\n2\u03c0m (x2 + d2 )2\n3\nd\n\n\f6\nThe integral of jy in x exactly equals to 0, which means the external electric current I can not induce an effective\ntransport electric current on the BLG, in contrast to that of MLG, where I induces an effective electric current \u2212\u03b1g I.\nThe induced magnetic field on BLG can be given as Bind (r) = Bz ez with\n!\n#\n\"\n\u221a\nx2 + d2\nx\n1\n1\nIge2\n2\n2\n+ (d \u2212 x ) arctan\n.\n(31)\n2dx log\n+ \u03b3E \u2212\nBz =\nm (x2 + d2 )2\n8\u039bd2\n3\nd\nIn MLG, the induced magnetic field \u2212\u03b1g Ix/(x2 + d2 ) is equivalent to the field created by a current \u2212\u03b1g I flowing at\nz = \u2212d. This argument does not fit for the case of BLG as shown in Eq.(31). At large distance x \u226b d, the induced\nmagnetic field is proportion to \u223c 1/x2 comparing with \u223c 1/x in MLG. However, the original current is repelled by a\nforce \u2248 \u03b1g (1/2d)I 2 /d per unit length, which can be approximately but not exactly considered as a force created by\na current \u03b1g (q)I at z = \u2212d with q = 1/2d.\nAs another typical example, we study the the induced magnetization, electric current and magnetic field by a\nmagnetic monopole qm laying above the BLG. Suppose qm is located at the point (0, 0, d), (d > 0), andpthe BLG\nplane is z = 0. The magnetic field perpendicular to the BLG is given as B(r) = qm d/(r2 + d2 )3/2 with r = x2 + y 2 .\nFor neutral BLG, the induced magnetization is given by\n\u001a\n\u001b\nh\nqm ge2\nr\nr 2 i\u22123/2\nm(r) = \u2212\nF ( ) \u2212 (log 2\u039br \u2212 1/3) 1 + ( )\n,\n(32)\n4\u03c0md2\nd\nd\nwhere the function\nF (x) =\n\n1\nx2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nzJ0 (z) log ze\u2212z/x dz.\n\n(33)\n\n0\n\nAt small distance (r \u226a d) and large distance (r \u226b d), the induced magnetization can be written as\n\uf8f1\b\n\u0002\n\u0003\nlog 2\u039bd + \u03b3E \u2212 43 \u2212 23 (r/d)2 log 2\u039br \u2212 31 /d2 (f or r \u226a d)\nqm ge2 \uf8f2\n\u00d7\nm(r) =\n\uf8f3\n4\u03c0m\n1/r2\n(f or r \u226b d)\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nIt is interesting to see that at large distance the induced magnetization of BLG m(r) \u221d 1/r2 , while that of MLG\n\u221d 1/r and 2DEG \u221d 1/r3 ; i.e., the BLG shows a behavior as the crossover from MLG to 2DEG. The integral of m(r)\nover the plane has a logarithmically diverging behavior \u221d log R when the distance R \u2192 \u221e. According to Eq.(32),\nthe corresponding electric current can be given by j(r) = \u2212(\u2202m/\u2202r)e\u03b8 \u2261 j\u03b8 e\u03b8 . When r is small or large, we obtain\n\uf8f1\n3r log 2\u039br/d4 (f or r \u226a d)\nqm ge2 \uf8f2\n\u00d7\n(36)\nj\u03b8 =\n\uf8f3\n4\u03c0m\n2/r3\n(f or r \u226b d)\n(37)\n\nRemind that our results are confined to the limit \u039br \u226b 1, and therefore jr is positive through out the realistic\ndistance. The current j\u03b8 in MLG \u221d r/(r2 + d2 )3/2 , whose asymptotic form is \u221d r at small distance and \u221d 1/r2 at\nlarge distance. We can find that the induced currents j\u03b8 of MLG and BLG are qualitatively different in all distance.\nHowever, similar to the case of line current, the force between the monopole and the BLG can be approximately\n2\n2\nwritten as \u03b1g (q)qm\n/(2d)2 with q = 1/d, which has the same form as that of MLG \u03b1g qm\n/(2d)2 .\nFor doped bilayer graphene (\u01ebF 6= 0), the corresponding response current j\u03b8 (r) for different values of kF are shown\nin Fig.[2]. We can find that the current change slightly as the Fermi wave number increase from kF d = 0 to kF d = 1;\ni.e., the induced current has a weak Fermi wave number dependence, which is rather different from that of MLG. This\narises from the fact that the dominant term involving kF in the susceptibility is logarithmically.\nDifferent from the traditional 2DEG, MLG has a peculiar property [18]: (1) The counter field induced by the\nresponse current mimics a mirror image of the original object. (2) The object is repelled by a diamagnetic force from\nthe MLG, as if there exists its mirror image with a reduced amplitude on the other side of MLG. With the investigation\nabove, we find that argument (1) can be not extended to BLG. However, the argument (2) still be approximately\ncorrect for weak-doped BLG, and it only needs to replace the constant reduced amplitude with a reduced amplitude\ndependent with the typical length of the systems. The BLG, in some sense, still show an intermediate behavior\nbetween the MLG and 2DEG.\n\n\f7\n\n4\n\nkFd\n0\n0.5\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03b8\n\nm\n\n8\u03c0md3j /(q ge2)\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\u039b/k =10\n\n0\n\nF\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr/d\nFIG. 2: Electric current j\u03b8 (r) on bilayer graphene induced by a magnetic charge qm at z = d. Here we use \u039b/kF = 10.\n\nIt is significant to compare the contribution of Landau diamagnetism to the whole magnetism with that of Pauli\nparamagnetism in BLG. At \u01ebF = 0, the Pauli spin susceptibility \u03c7spin (q), which is given by the density-density\nresponse function [25], is equivalent to gv m\u03bc2B log 4/2\u03c0, where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton. With Eq.(23), we obtain\nthe ratio \u03c7spin /\u03c7orb \u223c (0.03)2 /(log 2\u039b/q), which is rather small in our theory (f or q \u226a \u039b).\nThe temperature also has an influence on the BLG diamagnetism. For q = 0, this has been discussed by Safran\n[22], who shows the susceptibility with finite temperature and Fermi energy can approximately take the form\n\u03c7(q = 0; \u01ebF ; T ) \u221d log |\u03bc\u2212 /\u2206| \u2212 1 + (\u03bc+ /kB T ) log |\u03bc+ /\u03bc\u2212 |\n\n(f or \u03bc+ \u226a \u2206).\n(38)\np\nhere \u03bc\u00b1 = \u01ebF \u00b1 kB T /2. For finite q, we expect that \u03c7(q) deviates from log q in regime q \u2264 2m|\u01ebF \u2212 kB T /2|, which\nmeans the temperature\nhas notable affection on the diamagnetism of a neutral BLG when the typical length scale\n\u221a\nexceeds 2\u03c0/ 2mkB T , about 70\u03bcm at T = 1K.\nAll of the above, we assume an ideal 2D BLG electron gas and ignored the distance d between up layer and bottom\nlayer of bilayer graphene. In order to obtain an analytic expression of the susceptibility of bilayer graphene, we assume\nthe wave number kF and q is much smaller than the cutoff wave number \u039b. An alternative farther investigation can\nbe focused on a more general case that kF is commensurate to or even larger than \u039b.\n5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this article, we study analytically the orbital magnetic susceptibility of a weak-doped bilayer graphene (BLG) in\nspatially smoothly varying magnetic fields by the low-energy Hamiltonian and obtain the general analytic expression\nof the orbital susceptibility of BLG, with finite wave number and Fermi energy, at zero temperature. The induced\nmagnetization, electric current by the nonuniform magnetic fields in BLG are studied which are different from that\nof MLG and 2DEG, but the argument, that the magnetic object placed above the BLG is repelled by a diamagnetic\nforce which is equivalent to a force produced by mirror image on the other side of BLG, still be approximately hold,\nonly by replacing the constant reduced amplitude with a reduced amplitude dependent with the typical length of\nthe system. Logarithmically-dependent behaviors are found extensively exist in both the orbital magnetism and the\ninduced physical quantities by specific external field. BLG shows crossover behaviors in the responses to the external\nmagnetic field as the intermediate between MLG and 2DEG. The weak Fermi wave number dependent behaviors, as\na distinctive electric property of BLG, are found in induced magnetization and electric current.\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work is supported by NSFC Grant No.10675108.\n\n\f8\n\n[1] E.
