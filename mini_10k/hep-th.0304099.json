The methods\nof resolution whenever exist bear no resemblance. However the so-called Hitchin-type\ndescription fits into such systems as the Toda chain, the Neumann system, all versions of\nthe spin Calogero-Moser system [1], the rational and elliptic Gaudin model with spin [2].\nThis observation encourage us to develop this language and use this type of coordinates\nin the quantization problem due to its relative generality.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the first section we describe two types of considered models \u2013 the Hitchin system and the dynamical system on the space of rational\nmatrices. We recall the construction of separated variables and \"action-angle\" variables.\nIn this section we represent the Calogero-Moser system in terms of rational matrices. The\nsecond section is devoted to the symplectic structure of the Hichin system. We construct\nsuch a factorization of the tangent space to the phase space of the system which identify\nthe symplectic form with the Serre pairing on the spectral curve between H 0 (K\u03a3 ) and\nH 1 (O\u03a3 ). In the third section we give the analogous but more explicit factorization of\nthe tangent space to the phase space of the integrable system on the space of rational\nmatrices. In this case we also relate the tangent space with the meromorphic cohomology\ngroup of the spectral curve and show that the symplectic structure coincides with the\nRiemann bilinear form. The conclusion contains some open questions in the problem of\nquantization.\n\nAcknowledgments. The author is grateful to O. Babelon and F.

This work was partly supported by RFBR grant\n01-01-00546, RFBR grant for support of young scientist 03-01-06236.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nModel description\nHitchin-type systems\n\nOriginally the Hitchin system was defined in [3] as an integrable system on the cotangent\nbundle of the moduli space of stable holomorphic bundles of fixed rank r and degree d\nover the algebraic curve \u03a30 . The Poisson structure is the canonical one on the cotangent\nbundle. The space of function in involution is constructed as follows: a cotangent vector\nat a point E of the moduli space M is an element \u03c6 \u2208 H 0 (End(E) \u2297 K). There is a well\ndefined function hi : T \u2217 M \u2192 H 0 (K\u2297k ) such that hi (E, \u03c6) = 1i tr\u03c6i . The map\nh : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 \u2295ri=1 H 0 (K\u2297i )\nis called Hitchin map and realize the algebraic integrability, which means that the fibers\nare abelian lagrangian varieties of half dimension. The crucial role is played by the\n1\n\n\fspectral curve that is defined as follows. One can define the bundle morphism (non-linear)\nchar(\u03c6) : K \u2192 K\u2297r by\nchar(\u03c6)(\u03bc) = det(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bc \u2217 Id)\nwhere \u03bc is a local section of K and Id is the identical global section of End(E). The\nspectral curve is the preimage of the zero section in K\u2297r . It is an algebraic curve \u03a3 in the\nprojectivization of the total space of K.\nThe main problem in this description is the explicit parameterization of the moduli\nspace. There are several achievements in this direction. Firstly one can parameterize\nholomorphic bundles by \u010cech cochains. A problematic step is an infinite dimensional\nreduction to cohomologies. Another approach works in some specific situations [4, 5] and\nrelates to the Narasimhan-Ramanan parameterization [6, 7]. The Hecke-Turin coordinates\n[8, 9] provide another geometrical way to parameterize the moduli space.\nThe first level generalization of the Hitchin construction occurs when the base curve is\nsingular. This remarkable situation provides the explicit parameterization of the moduli\nspace in purely linear-algebraic terms. By the other hand it is rather general: such systems\nas the rational, trigonometric, and elliptic Calogero-Moser models,the rational and elliptic\nGaudin systems, the Neumann system and the Toda chain arise in the framework of the\nHitchin description on singular curves. This approach appeared in [10] and was elaborated\nin [11, 12].\nThe second level generalization crops up in the context of the space of Higgs pairs. A\nHiggs pair consists of a holomorphic bundle E on \u03a30 and a bundles homomorphism \u03c6 :\nE \u2212\u2192 E \u2297 L, where L is some fixed line bundle on \u03a30 not necessarily the canonical class.\nThe Poisson structure is less geometric in this case, it is given by the Kostant-Kirillov\nbrackets on orbits of the loop group [13, 14, 15]. We show that both generalizations\ncoincide in several examples and it is the subject of future works to establish their general\ncorrespondence.\n\n1.2\n\nRational matrices and separated variables\n\nIn [16] the following description of integrable systems was proposed: let us consider a\nfamily Spec of spectral curves \u03a3H defined by the equation\nR(\u03bb, \u03bc) = R0 (\u03bb, \u03bc) +\n\ng\nX\n\nHi Ri (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 0\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Hi are parameters and Ri are fixed polynomials on two variables. An analog of the\nHitchin fibration can be obtained in these terms: one takes the space C2g which is the\nspace of g-tuples of points Pi in C2 with coordinates (\u03bbi , \u03bci ). A condition that a curve\n\u03a3 \u2208 Spec contains g points Pi determines this curve\nH = \u2212B \u22121 V\n\n2\n\n\fwhere Bij = Rj (\u03bbi , \u03bci ) and Vi = R0 (\u03bbi , \u03bci ). Additionally, g points Pi gives us a divisor D\nof degree g on this curve. Hence one has the following fibration\nC2g\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6Jac(\u03a3)\ny\n\nSpec\n\nThe total space is endowed with a family of Poisson structures {\u03bbi , \u03bcj } = \u03b4ij f (\u03bbi , \u03bci ). One\nof the propositions of [16] is that this construction provides an integrable system for all\nchoices of such Poisson brackets, i.e. that the quantities Hi are in involution. In this case\nthe problem of constructing \"angle\" variables can be solved by the following\nLemma 1 The quantities\n\u03c6i =\n\nXZ\n\n\u03bbk\n\nRi (\u03bb, \u03bc)d\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bc R(\u03bb, \u03bc)f (\u03bb, \u03bc)\n\nk\n\nare conjugated to Hi\n{Hm , \u03c6l } = \u03b4ml .\nProof. Indeed, the equation (1) at the point Pj imply\nX\nR0 (\u03bbj , \u03bcj ) +\nHi Ri (\u03bbj , \u03bcj ) = 0\ni\n\nand\n\u2202\u03bc R(\u03bbj , \u03bcj ){\u03bbk , \u03bcj } +\n\nX\n\nRi (\u03bbj , \u03bcj ){\u03bbk , Hi } = 0.\n\ni\n\nIntroducing the notation\nCik = {\u03bbk , Hi },\none obtains equivalently\n\neji = \u2212\nB\n\nRi (\u03bbj , \u03bcj )\n\u2202\u03bc R(\u03bbj , \u03bcj )f (\u03bbj , \u03bcj )\n\ne =I\nBC\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix. Now we calculate the Poisson bracket\n{Hm , \u03c6l } = \u2212\n\nX\ni\n\n{\u03bbi , Hm }\n\nX\nRl (\u03bbi , \u03bci )\neil = \u03b4ml\n=\nCmi B\n\u2202\u03bc R(\u03bbi , \u03bci )f (\u03bbi , \u03bci )\ni\n\ndue to uniqueness of an inverse matrix.\u0003\nLet us show that such kind of description in terms of separated variables arises from a\ngeneralization of the Hitchin system \u2013 the dynamical system on the space of Higgs pairs.\nWe consider a specific case of the so-called Beauville system. Let us consider the rational\ncurve CP 1 and the degree n linear bundle O(n) on it. The semistable bundles on CP 1 can\nbe represented in the form E = Or \u2297 O(m) where Or is the trivial holomorphic bundle\n3\n\n\fof rank r. A Higgs field is an element of H 0 (Or \u2297 O(n)) due to the fact that End(E)\nis trivial. On the space of such sections there is a family of Poisson structures given as\nfollows: for a divisor D of degree n there is a realization of thePspace of holomorphic\nsection H 0 (Or \u2297 O(n)) by rational matrices with poles at D = ki=1 ni zi . This can be\ndone by taking a trivialization of the bundle Or \u2297 O(n) over the affine part CP 1 /D. On\nthe space of rational matrices with prescribed poles\n\u03a6(z) =\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03a6i (z) + \u03a6(\u221e);\n\n\u03a6i (z) =\n\ni=1\n\nni\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03a6ji\n,\n(z \u2212 zi )j\n\nthere is a Poisson structure given by the Kostant-Kirillov form on co-adjoint orbits of\nthe loop group represented by polar parts \u03a6i (z). The involutive subalgebra of functions is\nspanned by coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. The casimirs of co-adjoint orbits\nare among them. There are too many integrals and that is why one fixes some of them to\nbe central. Different choices of a divisor and central elements imply different integrable\nsystems. Let us demonstrate it on examples.\nExample 1 Consider a divisor D = z1 + z2 + z3 \u2212 \u221e of degree 2. The corresponding\nHiggs field is\n\u03a61\n\u03a62\n\u03a63\n\u03a6(z) =\n+\n+\nz \u2212 z1 z \u2212 z2 z \u2212 z3\nwith the condition \u03a61 + \u03a62 + \u03a63 = 0. Let us choose central elements to be\ncl = T r(\u03a6l1 ) + T r(\u03a6l2 ) and fix its value cl = 0. These conditions mean that \u03a61 and \u2212\u03a62\nbelong to the same orbit. In other words there exists such \u039b that \u03a61 \u039b = \u2212\u039b\u03a62 . Resolving\nthe condition \u03a61 \u2212 \u039b\u22121 \u03a61 \u039b + \u03a63 = 0 one obtains the traditional parameterization of the\ntrigonometric Calogero-Moser system (see [11] for details).\nOne can easily see that the spectral curve \u03a3 of the model\ndet(\u03a6(z) \u2212 k) = 0,\nwhich is constructed as a covering of the rational curve CP 1, can be considered as a\ncovering of a singular curve with the double point. Indeed, the points of \u03a3 over z1 and z2\ncoincide, this implies that k is a function on \u03a3sing , where the singularities on \u03a3sing arise\nfrom the double point on CP 1 . The Higgs field in this case corresponds to an element\nof H 0 (End(E) \u2297 K) on the rational curve with the double point for some holomorphic\nbundle E over it given by \u039b.\nExample 2 Consider a divisor D = 2z1 + z2 \u2212 \u221e of degree 2. The corresponding Higgs\nfield is\n\u03a60\n\u03a61\n\u03a62\n\u03a6(z) =\n+\n+\n2\n(z \u2212 z1 )\nz \u2212 z1 z \u2212 z2\nwith the condition \u03a61 + \u03a62 = 0. Let us choose central elements to be cl = T r(\u03a6l0 \u03a61 ) and\nfix its values cl = 0. It means that the orbit of \u03a61 (z) contains an element of the form\nA0\n.\n(z \u2212 z1 )2\n4\n\n\fIn other words there exists such X that \u03a61 = [X, \u03a60 ]. Resolving the condition \u03a61 + \u03a62 = 0\none obtains the traditional parameterization of the rational Calogero-Moser system (see\n[11] for details).\nBy analogy with the trigonometric case the spectral curve \u03a3 of the model, which is\nconstructed as a covering of the rational curve CP 1 , can be projected to a covering of\na singular curve with the cusp singularity. The Higgs field in this case can be realized\nas an element of H 0 (End(E) \u2297 K) on the rational curve with the cusp singularity for\nsome holomorphic bundle E over it given by X. Coincidence of the canonical form on\nco-adjoint orbits and the form in terms of separated variables was proved in [17].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nCanonical symplectic form. Hitchin system\nFactorization\n\nWe start with an identification between deformations of the spectral curve and holomorphic differentials on it. For a general algebraic curve this relationship can not be\nestablished, one has (3g \u2212 3)-dimensional space of deformations and only g-dimensional\nspace of holomorphic differentials. The spectral curves of considered systems are special;\nthey are parameterized by a g-dimensional space. One has the Hitchin map\n\u2217\n\nh : T M \u2212\u2192\n\nr\nM\n\nH 0 (\u03a30 , K\u2297i )\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the right hand side corresponds to the space of spectral curves Spec. It is a linear\nspace and one can identify its tangent space T Spec with itself. One also has that the\ndirect image of the structure sheaf O\u03a3 of the spectral curve is\n\u03c0\u2217 (O\u03a3 ) = O0 \u2295 K0\u22121 \u2295 . . . \u2295 K01\u2212r\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we have denoted O0 = O\u03a30 and K0 = K\u03a30 and \u03a30 is the base curve. This expresses the fact that locally any function on \u03a3 is a polynomial of degree < r on a fiber\nof the canonical class with coefficients which are functions on the base curve \u03a30 . This\nconsideration provides the following isomorphisms\nH 0 (O\u03a3 ) \u223c\n= H 0 (\u03c0\u2217 (O\u03a3 ));\n\nH 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u223c\n= H 1 (\u03c0\u2217 (O\u03a3 ))\n\ndue to the fact that the spectral sequence H i (\u03a30 , Rj \u03c0\u2217 F ) converges on the first term for\ncoverings of curves. By virtue of Serre duality the second isomorphism is equivalent to\nthe following\nH 0 (K\u03a3 ) \u223c\n= H 0 (\u03c0\u2217 (O\u03a3 )\u2217 \u2297 K0 ) = H 0 (\u2295ri=1 K0\u2297i ) = T Spec.\n\n(3)\n\nThe differential of the Hitchin map dh : T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) \u2212\u2192 H 0(K\u03a3 ) has an explicit description occurred in the context of the Whitham hierarchy in [18]. As it was mentioned\nf0 of the total space\nin the introduction the spectral curve \u03a3 lies in the compactification K\nof the canonical class of the base curve \u03a30 .\n5\n\n\ff0 , \u03c0 \u2217 (K0 )). Its restriction to the spectral\nOne has the tautological section y \u2208 H 0 (K\ncurve gives us a holomorphic differential over \u03a3. The infinitesimal form of the Hitchin\nmap becomes more clear in a local picture. Let U be an open set in \u03a30 and z \u2013 a\nlocal parameter on U. The canonical class trivializes over U and the Higgs field \u03a6 \u2208\nH 0 (End(E) \u2297 K0 ) can be represented as \u03a6(z) = L(z)dz where L(z) is a matrix valued\nfunction on z. The spectral curve over U is a set of pairs (z, k) which solve the characteristic\nequation det(L(z) \u2212 k) = 0. The tautological section in these terms is y = kdz, which\nis a well defined holomorphic differential over the spectral curve. Now deforming \u03a6 one\nobtains a deformation \u03b4y := \u03b4kdz where by \u03b4k we denote a variation of eigenvalues of L.\nFurthermore one has the following\nLemma 2 Let \u03b4\u03a6 \u2208 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) be a tangent vertical vector deforming \u03a6 then\ndh(\u03b4\u03a6) = \u03b4y\nunder the identification (3)\nProof. Let us choose such a covering of the base curve \u03a30 with two charts U1 , U2 that\nthe intersection U = U1 \u2229 U2 does not contain brunching points. We choose also a local\nparameter z on U. The canonical class K0 trivializes over U and we can choose a parameter\nk along fibers. The representation (2) means that O\u03a3 (\u03c0 \u22121 U) consists of functions f of\nthe type\nr\nX\nf=\nfi (z)k i\u22121 ; (2) : f 7\u2192 f \u0303 = {fi |i = 1, . . . , r}.\ni=1\n\nWe will prove that\n\n< dh(\u03b4\u03a6), f \u0303 >=< \u03b4y, f >,\n\nwhere on both sides we use appropriate Serre pairings.\nr\nr Z\nr Z\nX\nX\nX\nfi (z)k i\u22121 \u03b4kdz,\nf \u03b4kdz =\n< \u03b4y, f >=\nk=1\n\n\u2202Uk\n\nk=1\n\n\u2202Uk i=1\n\nwhere Uk are distinct preimages of U : \u03c0 \u22121 U = \u2294k Uk . Using the fact that k takes the\neigenvalues of L over U one obtains\nZ X\nr\nr Z\nr\nX\nX\n1 i\n1\nfi (z) \u03b4k dz =\n< \u03b4y, f >=\nfi (z)\u03b4( T rLi )dz.\ni\ni\n\u2202U i=1\nk=1 \u2202Uk i=1\nLet us note that the expression on the right hand side is indeed the pairing between\nH 1 (O0 \u2295 K0\u22121 \u2295 . . . \u2295 K01\u2212r ) and T Spec = H 0 (\u2295ri=1 K0\u2297i ) \u0003\nNow we return to the Poisson description of the Hitchin system. Hamiltonian flows\ncorrespond to the dynamics of a line bundle L over \u03a3 constructed from the following exact\nsequence\n\u03c0 \u2217 \u03a6\u2212y\n0 \u2212\u2192 L(\u2212R) \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 E \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 \u2217 (E \u2297 K0 ) \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere R is the branching divisor of \u03a3 over \u03a30 . The line bundle L varies over\nJac\u03a3 =\n\nH 1 (O\u03a3 )\n.\nH 1 (\u03a3, Z)\n6\n\n\fHence the phase space can be fibered over Spec by Jac where over a point \u03a3 \u2208 Spec\nthe fiber is Jac\u03a3 . A tangent vector to Jac\u03a3 is an element of H 1 (O\u03a3 ). Let us combine the\nnatural imbedding of vectors tangent to fibers to the tangent space of T \u2217 M at the point\n(E, \u03a6) and the differential of the Hitchin map to the exact sequence of vector spaces:\n\u03c1\n\ndh\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2212\u2192 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (K\u03a3 ) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n(4)\n\nLemma 3 The exact sequence (4) respects the special concordance between the canonical\nsymplectic form \u03c9 on T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) and the Serre pairing\n< *, * >: H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u00d7 H 0 (K\u03a3 ) \u2192 C.\nNamely, for an element \u03be \u2208 H 1 (O\u03a3 ) and X \u2208 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) one has:\n\u03c9(\u03c1(\u03be), X) =< \u03be, dh(X) > .\nProof. We consider the same covering as in the previous lemma. Let us call \"vertical\" a tangent vector v \u2208 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) which projects to 0 on M by the differential of\n\u03c4 : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 M. One can see that each element of T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) can be decomposed into\nthe sum of a vertical vector field and a hamiltonian vector field at a point (E, \u03a6).\nThe statement is obvious when X is a value of a hamiltonian vector field. It is equivalent to the fact that the image \u03c1(H 1 (O\u03a3 )) is lagrangian. Indeed, there is a g-dimensional\nspace of hamiltonian vector fields which span the tangent space to the Jacobian at each\npoint. Such fields are orthogonal because the hamiltonians are in involution.\nLet X be a vertical tangent vector \u03b4\u03a6 = \u03b4Ldz \u2208 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) and \u03b4L be a cocycle\ndeforming the line bundle on \u03a3. The direct image gives us a deformation \u03b4E = \u03c0\u2217 \u03b4L of a\nholomorphic bundle E on the base curve \u03a30 . Let us calculate the symplectic form:\nZ\nr Z\nX\n\u03b4L\u03b4kdz =< \u03b4L, dh(\u03b4\u03a6) >,\n\u03c9(\u03c1(\u03b4L), \u03b4\u03a6) =\nT r(\u03b4E\u03b4L)dz =\n\u2202U\n\ni=1\n\n\u2202Ui\n\nwhere the last equality is due to lemma 2. \u0003\nRemark 1 We present here the interpretation of the previous lemma in terms of\nquasi-isomorphisms. Let us consider the diagram\np1\n\nH 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2295 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M)\n\np2\n\n\u0581\n\n\u0582\n\nH 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2295 H 0 (K\u03a3 )\n\nT(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M)\n\nwhere p1 is a factorization subject to the diagonal embedding\n(id\u2295\u03c1)\u25e6\u2206\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2295 T(E,\u03a6) (T \u2217 M) \u2212\u2192 . . .\nand p2 = id \u2295 dh. Let \u03c9 \u2032 be the canonical symplectic form on H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2295 H 0 (K\u03a3 ) defined\nby Serre duality. Then the lemma above says that\np\u22171 \u03c9 = p\u22172 \u03c9 \u2032.\n\n7\n\n\f2.2\n\nSplitting\n\nOne of principal questions in the context of the decomposition (4) is a construction of\na symplectic splitting of the exact sequence. This means an embedding j : H 0 (K\u03a3 ) \u2212\u2192\nTE,\u03a6 (T \u2217 M) such that dh \u25e6 j = id|H 0 (K\u03a3 ) and\n\u03c1 \u2295 j : H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2295 H 0 (K\u03a3 ) \u2212\u2192 TE,\u03a6 (T \u2217 M)\nis a symplectomorphism, where on the left hand side the symplectic form is defined by\nSerre duality.\nLemma 4 The space of such splittings is an open subset in the space of lagrangian subspaces in TE,\u03a6 (T \u2217 M).\nProof. Let us note that the image Imj is a lagrangian subspace. Inversely, let V be a\nlagrangian subspace in TE,\u03a6 (T \u2217 M) such that V \u2229\u03c1(H 1 (O\u03a3 )) = 0 (it is an open condition).\nThen, choosing a basis {e1 , . . . , eg } in H 0 (K\u03a3 ) and the dual basis {e\u22171 , . . . , e\u2217g } in H 1 (O\u03a3 )\nlet us construct the splitting j as follows:\nj(ei ) = fi\nwhere {f1 , . . . , fg } is the basis in V \u2282 TE,\u03a6 (T \u2217 M) dual to {\u03c1(e\u22171 ), . . . , \u03c1(e\u2217g )}. The condition dh \u25e6 j = id|H 0 (K\u03a3 ) fulfills due to lemma 3. \u0003\nRemark 2 In the rest of the paper we will consider several natural ways to construct\nsuch a splitting. We also hope that the main ingredient \u2013 \"lagrangian connection\" \u2013 plays\na crucial role in the problem of quantization.\n\n3\n\nCanonical symplectic form. Rational matrices\n\nFirstly let us show that there is a natural lagrangian connection in the case of Beauville\nsystem. The phase space is the space of g points (\u03bbi , \u03bci ) in C2 . There is an exact sequence\nsimilar to the case of the Hitchin system:\ndh\n\nT Jac\u03a3 \u2212\u2192 T C2g \u2212\u2192 T\u03a3 Spec.\n\n(5)\n\nThe first injection is lagrangian. A splitting is an injection j inverting dh:\nj : T\u03a3 Spec \u0592\u2192 T C2g\nsuch that dh\u25e6j = id|T\u03a3 Spec and Im j is lagrangian. Let us fix {\u03bbi } and obtain a deformation\nof the spectral curve and the divisor on it by varying only the \u03bc-coordinates of points.\nThis deformation is obviously lagrangian due to the description of the Poisson structure\nin terms of separated variables. This allows us to use the following identification\nT C2g \u223c\n= H 1 (O\u03a3 ) \u2295 H 0 (K\u03a3 ).\nIn this section we also identify tangent vectors to the Jacobian with meromorphic differentials on the spectral curve by means of the Baker-Akhiezer function and construct the\nisomorphism\nT C2g \u223c\n(6)\n= H 0 (\u03a3, \u03a91M)\n8\n\n\fwhere \u03a91M is the sheaf of meromorphic 1-forms of the second kind on the spectral curve.\nWe prove that the symplectic structure coincides with the Riemann bilinear form in terms\nof the right hand side of (6).\n\n3.1\n\nLinear dynamics on Jac and Baker-Akhiezer function\n\nRemark 3 Here we demonstrate the correspondence between the Jacobian which is isomorphic to P ic0 and the \u010cech realization of the group of holomorphic degree 0 line bundles\nin H 1 (\u03a3, O\u2217 ). We have to construct a representative cocycle for the point of Jac. The main\ntechnique is the Abel transform and its inverse.\nFor the first let us consider the situation of the dynamics linearized on the Jacobian\nby components of the standard Abel transform. It means that the coefficients Ri define\nholomorphic differentials on the spectral curve \u03a3. The dynamics on Jac can be represented\nby X(t) = X(0) + tV. The vector V corresponds to the line bundle L0 on \u03a3 of degree 0\nconstructed as follows. The line bundles on \u03a3 can be obtained by the inverse image of\nthe Abel transform A\u2217 from the line bundles on Jac. The expression\ns(X) =\n\n\u03b8(X + V )\n\u03b8(X)\n\ndefines a line bundle on the Jacobian and has monodromy properties\ns(X + l) = s(X),\n\ns(X + Bl) = s(X) exp(\u22122\u03c0i(l, V )),\n\nwhere l \u2208 Zg and B is the matrix of b-periods of holomorphic differentials. Now we fix a\npoint P0 on the spectral curve and consider the space of normalized meromorphic differentials of the second kind with poles at P0 . Its factor by exact differentials is g-dimensional.\nWe can find such a differential \u03a90 which has specific b-periods\nZ\n\u03a90 = Vi .\n(7)\nbi\n\nNow the expression\n\u03c8(P ) = s(A(P )) exp(2\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\nP\n\n\u03a90 )\n\nis a well defined function on the spectral curve which has an essential singularity at P0\nand apart from P0 its divisor is the Abel inverse of V. This function defines a line bundle\non the spectral curve with the same divisor as follows: we define a covering (U0 , U1 ) of\n\u03a3 such that U1 = \u03a3/P0 and U0 is a disk centered at P0 which is sufficiently small to do\nnot contain points of the divisor. We take the principal part \u03c8ess of the function \u03c8 at\nthe point P0 and declare it to be a transition function for the chosen covering. There is\na meromorphic section \u03c8 on U1 and \u03c8/\u03c8ess on U0 . It has the same divisor. We arrive to\nthe classical lemma (see [19] and references therein)\nLemma 5 The linear dynamics on the Jacobian can be represented in terms of the transition function f01 subject to the chosen covering (U0 , U1 ) by follows\nf01 (t) = f01 (0) exp(t \u2217 ln(\u03c8ess )).\n9\n\n(8)\n\n\fThis lemma finishes the construction of the correspondence between the tangent space of\nthe Jacobian and meromorphic differentials of the second kind with poles at P0 . The choice\nof a family of spectral curves and a divisor of poles of meromorphic differentials characterizes different types of integrable systems. For example in the case of the Calogero-Moser\nsystem one needs to take meromorphic differentials with poles of the second order at\npoints Pi on the spectral curve which lie over \u221e \u2208 CP 1 . But in all cases there is the\ncorrespondence obtained above in terms of cohomologies.\n\n3.2\n\nDeformations of the spectral curve\n\nLet us consider the special case of a spectral curve\nX\nR(\u03bb, \u03bc) = R0 (\u03bb, \u03bc) +\nHi Ri (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 0\ni\n\nwhere the differentials\n\u03c9\u0303i =\n\nRi (\u03bb, \u03bc)d\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bc R(\u03bb, \u03bc)\n\nare holomorphic.\nRemark 4 Let us note that all mentioned systems can be represented in this form, at\nleast birationally. An interesting question is geometric interpretation of the dynamics\nwhen the differentials linearizing hamiltonian flows are meromorphic. The case of the spin\ngeneralization of the Calogero-Moser system gives us a partial response to this question.\nIn fact one should consider the generalized Jacobian where the lattice is generated by the\nperiods of holomorphic and some meromorphic differentials. And it can be identified with\nthe Jacobian of a singular spectral curve obtained by singularization of the base rational\ncurve.\nIn this case the identification between differentials and tangent vectors can be realized\nin a more direct way. The space of spectral curves is parameterized by coordinates Hi ,\none can identify \u03c9\u0303i with the tangent vector in i-th direction. This assignment is invariant:\na linear change of coordinates Hi involves an inverse linear change in terms of differentials\ndue to the equation of the curve. This is in agreement with the tensor low for the\ntangent space. Hence a tangent vector deforming the spectral curve is identified with a\nholomorphic differential w \u2208 H 0 (K\u03a3 ).\n\n3.3\n\nRiemann bilinear form and dynamics\n\nAnother point of view on the phase space of the system on the space of rational matrices involves holomorphic and meromorphic differentials. As we have already seen the\nmeromorphic differentials on the spectral curve correspond to the deformations of the\nline bundle and the holomorphic differentials give the deformations of the spectral curve.\nUsing the splitting of the exact sequence (5) we can establish an isomorphism between\nthe tangent space to the phase space and the meromorphic cohomology space H 0 (\u03a3, \u03a91M),\n\n10\n\n\fwhere \u03a91M is the space of meromorphic differentials of the second kind. There is a natural\nbilinear form on H 0 (\u03a3, \u03a91M)\n< \u03c91 , \u03c92 >= \u03c9R (\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) =\n\ng \u0012Z\nX\n\n\u03c91\n\nai\n\ni=1\n\nZ\n\n\u03c92 \u2212\nbi\n\nZ\n\nbi\n\n\u03c91\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c92 .\nai\n\n(9)\n\nNow we choose the normalized bases of differentials: \u03c9i \u2013 holomorphic differentials and\n\u03a9i \u2013 meromorphic differentials of the second kind with poles of order i + 1 at the chosen\npoint P0 such that\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9i = \u03b4ij ;\n\n\u03a9j = 0.\n\naj\n\nai\n\nIn this basis the matrix of the Riemann bilinear form (9) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 B\n\u03c9R =\n\u2212B 0\nR\nwhere Bij = bi \u03a9j .\n\nTheorem 1 The symplectic structure associated with the canonical Poisson structure on\nT \u2217 C2g viewed as a bilinear form on the space of meromorphic differentials coincides with\nthe Riemann bilinear form \u03c9R .\nProof. We proceed by evaluating the Hamiltonian\nmap. As we have seen a flow correRP\nsponding to the Hamiltonian Hk linearizes by\n\u03c9\u0303k where\n\u03c9\u0303k =\nOne has a linear decomposition\n\u03c9\u0303k =\n\nRk d\u03bb\n.\n\u2202\u03bc R\n\nX\n\nAki \u03c9i .\n\ni\n\nA tangent vector Vk on the Jacobian defined as the hamiltonian flow of Hk can be represented as the k-th column of A\u22121 in the basis related to chosen holomorphic differentials\n\u03c9i . Let us note that dHk has the same coordinates in terms of dH\u0303i , where H\u0303i correspond\nto \u03c9i . The meromorphic differential deforming the line bundle \u03a90 , defined by (7) for the\nk-th flow, can be given in coordinates associated with the chosen basis of differentials by\n\u03a90 = Bij\u22121 A\u22121\njk \u03a9i . It demonstrates that the Hamiltonian vector field related to the meromorphic differential \u03a90 is obtained by \u03b2(dHk ), where \u03b2 is the bivector corresponding to\nthe symplectic form \u03c9R . This verifies that the off-diagonal blocks of comparing symplectic\nstructures coincide. The diagonal blocks are zero in both cases. \u0004\nIn the dual language this bilinear form can be represented by a very natural structure. The cotangent space to the phase space of considered system can be identified with\nH1 (\u03a3, C).\nLemma 6 The Poisson bivector is the intersection index form in terms of cycles\nH1 (\u03a3, C).\n\n11\n\n\fProof. A bivector corresponding to the symplectic form \u03c9 is defined as follows: the\nsymplectic form defines a map \u03c9 # : T (V ) \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 (V )\n\u03c9 # (v) = i(v)\u03c9.\nNow a bivector is defined by\n\u03b2(\u03c9 # (X), \u03c9 # (Y )) = \u03c9(X, Y ).\nA covector \u03c9 # (X) can be represented by\n\u0013\n\u0013\nX \u0012Z\nX \u0012Z\n#\nX ai ;\nX bi \u2212\n\u03c9 (X) =\ni\n\nai\n\ni\n\nbi\n\none has a similar expression for \u03c9 # (Y ). Inserting these covectors into \u03b2 for all X, Y one\nobtains\n\u03b2(bi , bj ) = \u03b2(ai , aj ) = 0;\n\u03b2(ai , bj ) = \u03b4ij ;\n\u03b2(bi , aj ) = \u2212\u03b4ij .\nThis bivector coincides with the intersection index.\u0004\nRemark 5 The proof of the theorem was given in the case of meromorphic differentials\nwith one fixed pole of high order. We used this condition only to normalize differentials.\nThe proof in the general case is strictly analogous.\n\nConclusion\n\u2022 Lemma 6 gives us intuition of a geometric interpretation of the quantization: locally the classical Poisson algebra can be identified with a free commutative algebra\ngenerated by 1-cycles H1 (\u03a3, Z) with the Poisson structure given by the intersection\nindex. There is an obvious but rather tautological quantization of this Poisson algebra in geometric terms. One has a noncommutative multiplication on H \u2217 (\u03a3) which\nis just a wedge product. On the first cohomologies it restricts as\nH 1 (\u03a3) \u00d7 H 1 (\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (\u03a3).\nDue to Poincar\u00e9 duality one can identify H 1 (\u03a3, Z) with H1 (\u03a3, Z) and H 2 (\u03a3, Z) with\nH0 (\u03a3, Z). In fact this anticommutative multiplication on cycles coincides with the\nintersection index\nc1 \u2217 c2 = #(c1 , c2 ).\nIt corresponds to the quantization condition up to the constant 2\nc1 \u2217 c2 \u2212 c2 \u2217 c1 = 2#(c1 , c2 ).\nA question here is to investigate different ways of quantizing this Poisson algebra\nand to understand its geometric meaning. Some recent advances in this direction\nwere realized in [20] where the deformed abelian differentials were introduced and\na noncommutative multiplication over them was constructed. Let us mention that\nthis multiplication is far from being trivial, however it is anticommutative.\n12\n\n\f\u2022 We hope that the appearance of the new object in the context of Hitchin-type\nsystems \u2013 the lagrangian connection, which we used for splitting the factorization\nof the tangent space to the phase space, is not accidental. Eventually it is not\nsignificant on the classical level. However it contains some intrinsic geometrical\ndata which could be responsible for quantum deformations.\n\nReferences\n[1] I. Krichever, O.
