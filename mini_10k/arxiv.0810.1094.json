In optical traps, the hyperfine degree of freedom of confined atoms, such as\n87\nRb, is released and therefore the atom can exhibit magnetism. More intriguingly, an exchange-like spin-spin interaction can be present between atoms. In the F = 1\n87\nRb atoms, the interaction is ferromagnetic3, so the\n87\nRb gas appears to be a prototype of itinerant-boson\nferromagnet4,5,6,7,8 .\nFerromagnetism is one of the central research themes\nin condensed matter physics16,17 . Two types of ferromagnetism have already been intensively studied: localmoment ferromagnetism and itinerant-electron ferromagnetism. Although particles in these two systems obey\ndifferent statistics, they both share some common features. For example, both ferromagnets have a Curie\npoint, above which the susceptibility conforms to CurieWeiss law. Nonetheless, from the theoretical point of\nview, the origin of Curie-Weiss law is quite different\nfor these two systems. In insulators it is due to local\nthermal spin fluctuations and can be easily explained in\nthe mean-field approximation. On the other hand, in\nitinerant-electron ferromagnets the Curie-Weiss law may\nbe caused by the mode-mode coupling between spin fluctuations and the theoretical treatment is much more complicated17 . An appropriate theory is the self-consistent\nrenormalization (SCR) theory18 which goes beyond the\nHartree-Fock approximation and the random-phase approximation. The SCR theory succeeds in explaining various magnetic properties of itinerant-electron ferromagnets and is also extended to treat the specific heat19 .\nThe 87 Rb gas provides opportunity to study the third\ntype of ferromagnetism. Ho4 , Ohmi and Machida5 have\nstudied its ground state properties and the spin-wave\nspectrum. The long wavelength spectrum is linear in k,\nthe wave vector, as in the two former cases. In our previous papers, we have investigated the finite-temperature\nproperties, especially the Curie point8 . We suggest that\nthe phase diagram in itinerant bosons should be more\ncomplicated than the other two ferromagnets, because\n\nthe Bose system has an intrinsic phase transition, other\nthan the ferromagnetic transition. An interesting conclusion we arrived is that its Curie point, TF , is never below the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature, TC , regardless of the magnitude of the ferromagnetic coupling8 .\nKis-Szabo et al got the same point later9 . However, thermodynamics of the itinerant-boson ferromagnet has not\nyet been investigated systematically so far.\nThe purpose of this paper is to calculate the thermodynamic quantities of ferromagnetic bosons. As in the\nfermion case, the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility are of the most interest. In Section 2, we introduce\nthe mean-field approximation to deal with ferromagnetic\ninteraction, taking the spin-1 Bose gas as an example.\nIn Section 3, phase transitions are discussed by calculating the free energy and specific heat. In Section 4,\nthe susceptibility above the Curie point is calculated. A\nsummary is given in the last section.\nII.\n\nTHE MEAN-FIELD APPROXIMATION\n\nThe spin-1 Bose gas with ferromagnetic couplings is\ndescribed by the following Hamiltonian,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nXZ\n1 2\n\u0124 =\ndr\u03c8\u0302\u03c3\u2020 (r)\n\u2207 \u2212 \u03c3he \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r)\n2m\n\u03c3\nZ\n1\n\u2212 Is dr\u015c(r) * \u015c(r),\n(1)\n2\nwhere \u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (r) is the quantum field operator for annihilating an atom in spin state |\u03c3i at site r. For a spin-1\ngas, \u03c3 = +1, 0, \u22121. The parameter he denotes the external magnetic field. The last term represents the ferromagnetic exchange between two different bosons meeting at site r and Is (> 0) is the exchange constant.\n\u015c = {\u015c x , \u015c y , \u015c z } are the spin operators, which can be\nexpressed via the 3 \u00d7 3 Pauli matrices, for example,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c8\u0302+1\n1 0 0\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\uf8ed0 0 0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed \u03c8\u03020 \uf8f8 .\n(2)\n\u015c z = \u03c8\u0302+1\n\u03c8\u03020\u2020 \u03c8\u0302\u22121\n0 0 \u22121\n\u03c8\u0302\u22121\nWithin the mean-field approximation, we treat the spindependent interactions as a molecular field except of a\n\n\f2\nparticle with itself,\n\n-0.6\n\n1 2\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u015c * \u015c \u2248 \u2212h\u015ci * \u015c + h\u015ci * h\u015ci = \u2212M \u015c z + M , (3)\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u0124 \u2212 N\u0302 \u03bc =\n\nX\nk\u03c3\n\n\u0124 \u2212 N\u0302 \u03bc\n]\nkB T\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n5\n\u03bc + \u03c3h\n1 2\n(kB T ) 2 V m 2 X\n5\nf\n+ M Is N,(5)\n= \u2212\n2 32\n2\nkB T\n2\n(2\u03c0h\u0304 )\n\u03c3\n\n\u03a9 = \u2212kB T ln T r exp[\u2212\n\nwhere h = hm + he , m is the mass of particle, and f is\nthe polylogarithm function defined by\nfn (x) \u2261\n\n\u221e\nX\n(ex )k\nk=1\n\nkn\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere x \u2264 0.

We find that TF is never below TC for all\nsystems with a finite ferromagnetic exchange (Is 6= 0).\nHowever, one can get another solution to the Eqs. (7),\nwith M = 0 at all temperatures. It means the system\ndoes not undergo a ferromagnetic transition at all, but\nremains in paramagnetic (PM) state at low temperatures.\nActually, whether there exists a Curie point in the ferromagnetic Bose gases is still a controversial question.\nSome researchers suppose that the Bose gas can not be\nmagnetized spontaneously at low temperatures even if\nthe ferromagnetic exchange is present20 .\nIn order to single out the physically correct solution,\none has to compare the free energy of the the ferromagnetic (FM) state and the PM state. The relation between\nthe free energy and the grand thermodynamic potential\nhas the form:\nF = \u03a9 + N\u03bc .\n\n(8)\n\nFor computational convenience, the temperature T and\nexchange interaction Is are re-scaled, as did in Ref.

Figure 1 shows the free energy\nof unit volume for the gas with I = 1.0. It shows clearly\nthat the free energy of FM state is lower than that of the\nPM state at the low temperature region, which demonstrates that the FM state should be more stable than\nPM state. Therefore, the low temperature state has a\nspontaneous magnetization. In experiments, the total\nspin of the ferromagnetic spinor condensate is observed\nto be conserved, which is called the spin conservation rule\nin some literatures13,14 .

The dotted vertical lines serve to guide the\neye to see the transition points.\n\nFor a ferromagnet, the susceptibility above the Curie\npoint is of special interest. As already studied, the susceptibility is well described by Curie-Weiss law both in\nthe insulating ferromagnet and the itinerant-electron ferromagnet. In this section we calculate the susceptibility\nfor the itinerant-boson ferromagnet.\nThe susceptibility can be derived from Eqs. (7). Differentiating both sides of the two equations and removing\nthe term d\u03bc, the following equation are deduced,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIs M + he\ndM = f d\n,\n(11)\nkB T\nwhere\n\ntreatment of Ref. [20], the spin conservation rule is imposed by introducing a lagrangian multiplier. It is overconstrained in some sense, so that the spontaneous magnetization can not be established. Recent experiments\nand theories indicate some domain structures should be\nformed and each domain is magnetized11,12,15 , where the\nconservation law for the total spin can be restored naturally.\nThe FM transition is induced by the FM coupling and\nthe transition temperature is about tf \u2248 0.8 for the Bose\ngas with I = 1.0. When the temperature goes down further, the BEC then occurs, which is the intrinsic phase\ntransition of Bose gases.

This is a characteristic feature of the Landau-type of second-order phase\ntransition. And similar behaviors have been observed in\nthe specific heat of ferromagnetic insulators or itinerantfermion ferromagnets16,17 . The BEC occurs at tc \u2248 0.5,\nwhere the specific exhibits a bend. But specific heat is\ncontinuous at the BEC point, similar to that of a free\nBose gas.

Figure 3 shows 1/\u03c7 and \u03c7 versus I at different given temperatures. As shown in the inset of Fig.\n3, the susceptibility becomes larger as the coupling I increasing. It is physically reasonable since the the system\nwith larger I can be magnetized more easily. At a given\ntemperature, \u03c7 diverges as I approaches a critical value.\nIt is worth noting that the inverse of the susceptibility is\nin a good linear relationship with the coupling.\nThe susceptibility versus temperature is shown in Fig.\n4. One can immediately find that the susceptibility meet\nquite well with the Curie-Weiss law in a very large temperature region. Seeing that the Curie-Weiss law is very\ndifficult to be derived for the itinerant-fermion ferromagnet, it is really surprising that we get it for the itinerantboson ferromagnet just based on the mean-field approximation.\nIn order to discuss the Curie-Weiss law in a more explicit way, we proceed to carry out a semi-analytical calculation to deduce the linear dependence of 1/\u03c7 on the\n\n\f4\nIn the vicinity of TF which is only slightly larger than\nT0 , Eq.

The first step is to analyze the temperature dependence of f . It is quite complicated, because the\nchemical potential \u03bc is an implicit function of the temperature.

Based on a mean-field approximation,\nwe show that the system undergos a ferromagnetic phase\ntransition first, then the Bose-Einstein condensation with\nthe temperature decreasing. The specific heat shows a\njump discontinuity at the Curie point and a bend at the\nBose-Einstein condensation temperature, indicating that\ncritical behaviors are different near the two transition.\nThe more surprising result is that the mean-field theory\nyield the magnetic susceptibility which satisfies perfectly\nthe Curie-Weiss law over a wide range of temperature.\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 10504002), the\nFok Yin-Tong Education Foundation, China (Grant No.\n101008), and the Ministry of Education of China (Grant\nNo. NCET-05-0098).\n\n\f5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n12\n\nD.M.
