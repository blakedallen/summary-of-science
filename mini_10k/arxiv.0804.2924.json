INTRODUCTION\n\nPlanetary debris disks are one of the best means to explore the evolution of planetary systems. The Spitzer mission\nhas made fundamental contributions to our understanding of\nthem, including documenting the wide variety in properties\nsuch as amounts of excess emission, disk size and grain properties derived from mineralogical features (Rieke et al. 2005,\nSu et al. 2006, Trilling et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2006). Two\npossibilities for this variety are: 1.) disks share a similar evolution, but with a wide range of initial masses (e.g., Wyatt et\nal. 2007b; Kenyon & Bromley 2008); and 2.) there are substantial evolutionary differences such as large collisions that\ndominate the amount of debris for a period of time (Wyatt et\nal. 2007a). There may also be a mixture of these possibilities\n(Rieke et al. 2005; Wyatt et al. 2007b). In any case, understanding debris disks requires determination of their range of\nbehavior where critical boundary conditions that might influence these systems are held fixed.\nHere we report a detailed study of the debris disk around\n\u03b3 Ophiuchi, a 184 Myr-old A0 V star (Song et al. 2001, Rieke\net al. 2005) at a distance of 29.1\u00b10.8 pc with an infrared excess detected in the IRAS point-source catalog (Sadakane &\nNishida 1986). Fajardo-Acosta et al. (1997) report marginal\nevidence that \u03b3 Oph is extended at 60 \u03bcm. In this paper,\nwe describe imaging with Spitzer that confirms this result by\nclearly resolving the disk at both 24 and 70 \u03bcm. Although the\nradii of other resolved disks (e.g., Fomalhaut) are typically\nonly about 150 AU, we find that the \u03b3 Oph disk is almost\nfour times as large. We combine this size measurement with\nthe detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) of the disk to\nderive its properties, and compare them to those of a small\nsample of debris disks with similar host stars.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe observations presented here are from various Spitzer\nprograms. The IRS spectrum of \u03b3 Oph was previously published based on an older pipeline reduction (S11) by Chen\net al. (2006). Here we present the S15 reduction with updated flux non-linearity corrections. Observations at 24 \u03bcm\nwere obtained at two epochs in standard small-field photometry mode using 3 sec\u00d74 cycles at 5 sub-pixel-offset positions,\n1\n\nSteward Observatory, University of Arizona, 933 N Cherry Ave., Tucson,\nAZ 85721; ksu@as.arizona.edu\n2 JPL/Caltech, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109\n3 Spitzer Fellow; NOAO, Tucson, AZ 85726\n\nresulting in a total integration of 840 sec on source for each\nepoch. The observation at 70 \u03bcm was done in fine-scale mode\nwith 3 sec\u00d71 cycle at 4 sub-pixel-offset positions, resulting\nin a total integration of \u223c100 sec on source. A MIPS SEDmode observation was obtained with 10 sec\u00d710 cycles, and a\n1\u2032 chop distance for background subtraction.\nAll of the MIPS data were processed using the Data Analysis Tool (Gordon et al. 2005) for basic reduction (e.g., dark\nsubtraction, flat fielding/illumination corrections), with additional processing to minimize artifacts (see Engelbracht et\nal. 2007). For the 70 \u03bcm fine-scale data, each of the on-source\nexposures was subtracted from an average background composed of before and after off-source exposures to remove the\ntime-dependent column offsets in the background. The final\nmosaics were combined with pixels half the size of the physical pixel scale (Figure 1). The MIPS SED-mode data were\nreduced and calibrated as described by Lu et al. (2008).\nAt 24 \u03bcm, the non-color-corrected measurement gives\n434\u00b13 mJy using an aperture radius of 15\u2032\u2032 with a background\nannulus of 30\u2032\u2032 \u201342\u2032\u2032 , and an aperture correction of 1.143. The\nexpected photospheric flux density in the 24 \u03bcm band is 236\nmJy, resulting in a 24 \u03bcm infrared excess of 202 mJy after a\ncolor correction of 1.021 (for a blackbody temperature of 80\nK, which is the characteristic color temperature of the disk\n(see \u00a73.2)). The total color-corrected flux density in the 24\n\u03bcm band is 438\u00b118 mJy, including the uncertainty in the calibration factor of 0.0454 MJy sr\u22121 (DN s\u22121 )\u22121 (Engelbracht et\nal. 2007). For the 70 \u03bcm fine-mode photometry, we use an\naperture with a radius of 16\u2032\u2032 , sky annulus of 18\u2032\u2032 \u201339\u2032\u2032 , and an\naperture correction of 1.9. A total flux density of 1140 mJy\nwas estimated using a flux calibration factor of 2894 MJy sr\u22121\nMIPS70F\u22121 (Gordon et al. 2007). The expected photospheric\nflux density in the 70 \u03bcm band is 26 mJy; therefore, the disk\nflux density is 1185 mJy after a color correction of 1.064 (for\na blackbody temperature of 80K). The total color-corrected\nflux density in the 70 \u03bcm band is 1211\u00b1121 mJy. All available photometry and spectra of \u03b3 Oph are shown in the SED\nplot in Figure 2.\n3. ANALYSIS\n3.1. PSF Subtraction\n\nThe excess emission at 24 \u03bcm is roughly equal in brightness to the expected photospheric value and yet the source\nappears point-like at 24 \u03bcm. To reveal the disk, the Point\nSpread Function (PSF) must be subtracted. We used deep ob-\n\n\f2\n\nF IG . 2.- Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of \u03b3 Oph. The photometry\nof 80\u00b120 mJy at 350 \u03bcm is obtained with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (Dowell et al. in prep.). The optical and near-infrared photometry\nis from the Simbad database and 2MASS catalog, while the other symbols\nare defined on the plot. The dotted-dashed line is the output SED using the\nbest-fit parameters.\n\nF IG . 3.- The excess SED of the \u03b3 Oph disk. Symbols and lines are the\nsame as in Figure 2 except for the stars showing the ten photometric points\nused for \u03c72 fitting. Two single component models are shown (p=0 with grains\nof 5\u201363 \u03bcm and \u03c72 =0.8, and p=1 with grains 1.6-100 \u03bcm and \u03c72 =10.4). As\nan illustration, the total SED of a three-component (not unique) disk model\nwith \u03c72 =0.7 is shown along with the SED of each component.\n\nservations of the non-excess A4 V star \u03c43 Eri4 to determine the\nPSF. At 24 \u03bcm, the Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM24 ) of\nthe \u03c43 Eri image is 5.\u2032\u2032 52\u00d75.\u2032\u203248 using a 2-D Gaussian fitting\nfunction on a field of 26\u2032\u2032 with an uncertainty of 0.\u2032\u2032 02\u00d70.\u2032\u203202\nbased on \u223c100 calibration star observations. The \u03c43 Eri image\nwas scaled to the expected photospheric flux density of \u03b3 Oph\nand to 1.6 times this value for PSF subtraction. The higher\nvalue (over-subtraction) allows for the possibility of a significant portion of the excess emission lying close to the star as\nin Fomalhaut (Stapelfeldt et al. 2004). The results of the PSF\nsubtractions are shown in Figure 1. An elliptical outer disk\nalong the position angle of \u223c56\u25e6 is seen in the over-subtracted\nimage, while the photospheric-subtracted image confirms that\nmuch of the disk emission lies within the PSF. The disk is at\nleast 9\u2032\u2032 (\u223c260 AU) in radius at 24 \u03bcm.\nTo test for any color dependence in this process, we subtracted the image of \u03c43 Eri from the image of \u03b6 Lep, a debris disk known to be largely confined to within 3 AU (0.\u2032\u2032 14)\nradius at 20 \u03bcm (Moerchen et al. 2007), with various scaling factors. There are no disk-like residuals in the subtracted\nimage. The FWHM24 of the photosphere-subtracted \u03b6 Lep\nimage (5.\u2032\u2032 61\u00d75.\u2032\u203255) gives a characteristic resolution for a\nred point source, slightly broader than given by a blue PSF\n(\u03c43 Eri). The FWHM24 of \u03b3 Oph before photospheric subtraction is 5.\u2032\u2032 84\u00d75.\u2032\u203261, which is only 1.06\u00d71.03 broader than a\nblue PSF. However, this difference is significant at 16-\u03c3 compared to a blue PSF and 11-\u03c3 to a red PSF. The FWHM24 of\nthe \u03b3 Oph disk after photospheric subtraction is 6.\u2032\u2032 41\u00d75.\u2032\u203275,\nwhich is 1.14\u00d71.03 broader than a red PSF represented by the\nunresolved core of the \u03b6 Lep disk.\nThe source appears slightly elongated at 70 \u03bcm (Figure 1c).\nNo photospheric subtraction is needed because the disk is\n\u223c50 times brighter than the stellar photosphere. However, the\nfaint extended disk emission is more evident after the subtraction of a PSF representing the bright inner disk (Figure 1d).\nThe faint extended emission can be traced up to \u223c18\u2032\u2032 (\u223c520\nAU, at 3-\u03c3 level) in radius along the position angle of \u223c55\u25e6.\nThe disk has a FWHM70F of 18.\u2032\u2032 5\u00d716.\u2032\u20321 determined using a\nGaussian fitting on a field of 55\u2032\u2032 . Examining two blue calibration stars (HD 48348 and HD 48915), a typical FWHM70F\n\nof 15.\u2032\u2032 3\u00d714.\u2032\u20324 with an uncertainty of 0.\u2032\u2032 2\u00d70.\u2032\u203206 was determined, suggesting that the \u03b3 Oph image core at 70 \u03bcm is\n1.2\u00d71.1 times wider than a blue PSF, and resolved at 16- and\n28-\u03c3 levels for the major and minor axises. The position angle of the disk determined from both 24 and 70 \u03bcm images is\n55\u25e6 \u00b12\u25e6 . The MIPS slit (width of 19.\u2032\u2032 8) was at the position\nangle of \u223c95\u25e6 when the SED-mode observation was taken. A\nsmall fraction of the faint extended disk emission was outside\nthe slit, which may explain the slightly lower (\u223c5%) SEDmode flux compared to the fine-mode photometry.\n\n4 MIPS 24 \u03bcm measurement (247\u00b13 mJy) and an updated IRS spectrum\nshow no excess in this source.\n\n3.2. Spectral Energy Distribution Fitting\n\nThe broadband excess photometry at 24 and 70 \u03bcm indicates a color temperature (Tc ) of 81 K, which over predicts the\nobserved flux at 28\u201335 \u03bcm and 55\u201365 \u03bcm (see Figure 2). This\nsuggests that the dust grains in the system have a wider range\nof temperatures. To model the disk SED (Figure 3), we use\na simple geometrically-thin debris disk model where the central star is the only heating source and the dust is distributed\nradially between inner (Rin ) and outer (Rout ) radii according\nto a r\u2212p power law for the surface number density. The grains\nin the disk follow a n(a) \u223c a\u2212q size distribution with a minimum radius of amin and a maximum radius of amax , assumed\nto be the same throughout the disk. To minimize the free parameters, we assume that the grains are astronomical silicates\n(Laor & Draine 1993) with a density of 2.5 g cm\u22123 and are in\ntheoretical collisional equilibrium; i.e. q = \u22123.5.\nWe determined the best-fit Kurucz model for the stellar photosphere by fitting the optical to near-IR photometry (Su et\nal. 2006), and estimated the stellar temperature and luminosity to be 9750 K and 28.6 L\u2299 . With these stellar parameters, grains smaller than \u223c5 \u03bcm are subject to radiation pressure blowout since \u03b2, the ratio between radiation and gravitational forces (Burns et al. 1979), is > 0.5. To capture the\nslope of the IRS spectrum and MIPS SED-mode data, we selected two points (26.5 and 30 \u03bcm) in the IRS spectrum and\nfour wavelengths (55.4, 65.6, 75.8, and 86.0 \u03bcm) in the MIPS\nSED-mode data for the global SED fitting. Combined with\nthe broadband photometry, a total of ten data points shown\nas stars in Figure 3 are used to compute \u03c72 to determine the\nbest-fit debris disk model.\nTo fit the fairly flat slope between 55 and 95 \u03bcm and the\n\n\f3\n\nF IG . 4.- Comparison cuts along the disk major axis at 24 \u03bcm (upper panel)\nand 70 \u03bcm (lower panel). The cuts at 24 \u03bcm are averaged over a width of\n5\u2032\u2032 , and a width of 10.\u2032\u2032 5 at 70 \u03bcm. A dotted line in each panel indicates a\nnominal 1-\u03c3 detection on the image.\n\nobserved flux at 350 \u03bcm simultaneously, the maximum grain\nsize has to be <100 \u03bcm. This might be an artifact of the\nassumption that the grains have the same size distribution\nthroughout the disk (see \u00a74). In addition, since there are no\nobvious silicate features, the majority of the grains in the disk\nare larger than a few microns. Therefore, we assume amin to be\nthe blowout size, \u223c5 \u03bcm, and amax to be \u223c63 \u03bcm, and that the\ndisk has a constant surface density consistent with a PoyntingRobertson (P-R) drag dominated disk. With these grain properties and density distribution, the SED is consistent with a\n1-component disk with an inner radius of 13+4\n\u22123 AU and outer\nradius of 430+130\n\u221230 AU. However, a P-R drag dominated disk\nis not expected physically given the high disk density (fractional luminosity fd \u223c9\u00d710\u22125) since collisions should destroy\ngrains before they can spiral inward (Wyatt 2005).\nWe also explored the possibility of fitting the SED with an\noutflow disk, in which the majority of the grains are smaller\nthan the blowout size and the surface density follows a r\u22121\npower law (e.g., the Vega debris disk; Su et al. 2005). Various\ncombinations of amin , amax , Rin and Rout were tried, and none\nyield a correct spectral slope between 20\u201330 \u03bcm (one example\nis shown in Figure 3). In addition, because smaller grains\nhave higher temperatures than larger ones at the same radius,\nmodels including grains smaller than the blowout size force\nRin to be a large distance (\u223c100 AU=3.\u2032\u2032 4), contradicting the\nobserved compact core of the disk. This suggests that the\n\u03b3 Oph system cannot be an outflow disk entirely.\n3.3. Debris Disk Imaging Fitting\n\nLimited by the spatial resolutions, no multiple disk components can be distinguished in the observed images except\nfor the extent of the disk. To further constrain the model,\nwe constructed model images with the best-fit SED param-\n\neters (p=0, amin \u223c5 \u03bcm, amax \u223c63 \u03bcm, Rin =13+4\n\u22123 AU, and\nRout =430+130\n\u221230 AU) from the SED fitting. These model images\nwere then convolved with appropriate PSFs to compare with\nthe observed images based on the FWHMs and radial surface\nbrightness distributions.\nFor a geometrically thin disk model, the observed disk morphology only depends on how the disk is viewed, i.e., the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the plane of the sky,\ni. We first explored the influence of the outer radius by fixing\nRin =13 AU, the grain parameters and i=90\u25e6 . The FWHM24\nof the convolved model images with outer radii ranging from\n350 to 1000 AU shows no change, but a major-axis FWHM70F\nof the convolved model images varies from 17.\u2032\u2032 0 to 20.\u2032\u2032 4 with\nthe minor-axis FWHM70F of 14.\u2032\u2032 2. This again confirms that\nthe 24 \u03bcm emission arises from warm grains that are not sensitive to the outer extent of the disk. The observed majoraxis FWHM70F of the disk (18.\u2032\u2032 5) implies a Rout of \u223c520\nAU. With the Rin , Rout and grain parameters fixed, we determined the inclination angle by fitting both major- and minoraxis FWHMs. Convolved model images were constructed for\nface-on (i=0\u25e6 ) to edge-on (i=90\u25e6 ) disks in increments of 5\u25e6 .\nThe major-axis FWHMs of the model images remain the same\nwithin measurement errors at both 24 and 70 \u03bcm. From 0\u25e6 to\n90\u25e6 , the minor-axis FWHM24 and FWHM70F changed from\n6.\u2032\u2032 1 to 5.\u2032\u2032 6 and 17.\u2032\u2032 6 to 14.\u2032\u2032 2, respectively. We conclude that\nthe observed FWHMs at 24 and 70 \u03bcm are consistent with a\ndisk viewed at i=50\u25e6 \u00b15\u25e6 .\nFor a quantitative comparison, we show cuts along the disk\nmajor axis for both the observed and best-fit model images at\n24 and 70 \u03bcm in Figure 4. Similar cuts made on point-source\nPSFs, scaled to match the peak values of the observations,\nare also shown. Our simple 1-component, bound-grain debris\ndisk model is in very good agreement with the observed disk\nsurface brightness at 24 \u03bcm over a dynamic range of two orders of magnitude. At 70 \u03bcm, the observed signal-to-noise\nratios are not as good as at 24 \u03bcm, but the model agrees to\nwithin the estimated uncertainties and approximates the data\nmuch better than a point source.\n4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nBased on the Spitzer images and SED modeling, the disk\naround \u03b3 Oph has inner and outer boundaries of \u223c13 and\n\u223c520 AU, respectively, viewed at an inclination angle of\n\u223c50\u25e6, assuming a 1-component constant-surface (p=0) density disk consisting of bound (5\u201363 \u03bcm) astronomical silicate\ngrains. The dust mass is \u223c1.0\u00d710\u22122 M\u2295 . The star's projected\nrotation velocity is 210 km s\u22121 (Royer et al. 2007), suggesting an equatorial velocity of 256-300 km s\u22121 with i ranging\nfrom 55\u25e6 to 45\u25e6 . Although these values are very close to the\nmaximum permissible velocity (Gulliver et al. 1994), the estimated disk inclination angle is within the permitted range of\nplausible stellar inclination angles.\nThe broadband SED alone provides too little information to\nconstrain properly the variables needed for even the simplest\ndisk models, but a better understanding can be achieved by\nconsidering other constraints. The exact Rin of the disk is\nsensitive to amin used in the model. The fact that the excess\nemission starts at .15 \u03bcm suggests that dust exists as close\nas \u223c10 AU, assuming blackbody radiators. Since the grains\nin a debris disk are generated by collisional cascades from\nlarge (\u223ckm-size) parent bodies, amax is usually assumed to be\n\u223c1000 \u03bcm. To make the single component model consistent\nwith the faint extended disk detected at 70 \u03bcm and with the\nassumed grain size distribution, amax has to be reduced to \u223c63\n\n\f4\n\u03bcm. A more physically realistic model will involve multiple\ncomponents while requiring the presence of very large grains\nin the disk.\nWe used a three-component disk to derive a model consistent with the expected grain physics and the observed\nspectrum/SED. The three components are: (1) a narrow\n(\u03b4R\u223c0.1R) ring of parent bodies at \u223c80 AU where large\ngrains are located; (2) an outflow disk (80\u2013520 AU) with\ndensity \u221d r\u22121 outside the narrow ring consisting of grains being ejected by radiation pressure with sizes smaller than the\nblowout size; (3) a component with density \u221d r0 interior to\nthe narrow ring and extending to \u223c10 AU (e.g., as of grains\nslowly drifting inward due to P-R drag). Many combinations\nof parameters in this three-component disk model would yield\nacceptable fits to the observed data. One example is shown in\nFigure 3, but it is not unique without further constraints.\nGiven the exceptionally large disk seen in the \u03b3 Oph images, one may wonder whether it is another Vega-like disk\n(an outflow disk observed at 24 and 70 \u03bcm extending from a\nring of large parent bodies that dominate the emission at 850\n\u03bcm, Su et al. 2005). The failure to fit all of the available data\nwith our simple 1-component outflow model suggests that the\ncontribution by grains escaping from the \u03b3 Oph disk is weak,\nunlike for the Vega disk where such grains dominate the disk\nemission (\u223c100% at 24 \u03bcm and \u223c75% at 70 \u03bcm). Persuasive evidence of \u03b3 Oph being another Vega-like disk would\nrequire the disk size at 350 \u03bcm to be substantially smaller\nthan the size inferred in the infrared. However, the signal-tonoise of the 350 \u03bcm data is too low to show the extent of the\nemission. Observations at longer submillimeter or millimeter\nwavelengths and higher spatial resolution are needed to determine the exact location and amount of the cold component.\nAn attractive comparison sample of debris disks for \u03b3 Oph\nis defined by systems with stellar ages between 150 and 400\nMyr, spectral types between A0V and A3V, and fd between\n10\u22125 and 10\u22124 , for which Su et al. (2006) find a total of 12\nstars5 including the resolved disks around Vega and Fomalhaut. The disk around Fomalhaut defines the expected template structure given our knowledge of the solar system. It\nconsists of two separate dust belts: a Kuiper-Belt-analog ring\n5 Besides \u03b3 Oph, Vega and Fomalhaut: \u03b9 Cen: T \u223c250 K, \u03b6 Lep: T \u223c206\nc\nc\nK, \u03b1 CrB: Tc \u223c125 K, \u03b2 UMa: Tc \u223c116 K, 30 Mon: Tc \u223c105 K, HD 38056:\n\nwith a radius of \u223c150 AU prominent at \u03bb &70 \u03bcm and a\nfair amount of zodiacal-analog warm dust located <20 AU\nfrom the star. Little emission originates from outside of the\nKuiper Belt ring. In the Fomalhaut disk, the ratio between\nthe central unresolved and the extended emission is 3\u20136 at\n24 \u03bcm (Stapelfeldt et al. 2004), while the ratio is \u223c2\u20133 in\nthe \u03b3 Oph disk. The Kuiper-Belt-analog ring in the Fomalhaut system totally dominates the emission at 70 \u03bcm, but at\nthe distance of \u03b3 Oph (\u223c4\u00d7 that of Fomalhaut), such a ring\nwould be unresolved.\nTwo of the twelve systems (\u03b6 Lep and \u03b9 Cen) have 24 to\n70 \u03bcm color temperatures > 200 K (Su et al. 2006). Groundbased 20 \u03bcm imaging of \u03b6 Lep shows it to be dominated by a\nvery compact inner warm disk (Moerchen et al. 2007). Three\nmore systems (30 Mon, \u03b2 UMa, \u03b1 CrB) have color temperatures of 100\u2013150 K, indicating relatively large amounts of\nmaterial in their inner zones. All of these systems are likely\nto have more debris-generating activity close to the star than\nthe disks around Fomalhaut (color temperature of 70 K) or\n\u03b3 Oph. Of the remaining seven systems, at least two have\nanomalous activity in their outer zones: Vega with its large\n(\u223c800 AU) halo, and \u03b3 Oph with a disk \u223c520 AU in radius.\nIt appears that much of the overall debris disk behavior can\nbe explained as the result of similar evolution from starting\npoints that differ in the initial disk mass (Wyatt et al. 2007b).\nHowever, the large variety in behavior among the sample of\ntwelve middle-aged disks demonstrates that one or more additional parameters must also be at play. For instance, the presence and number of massive planets, the recent collisional history of the system (Kenyon & Bromley 2005, 2006), as well\nas the variety in the initial disk size may all play important\nroles in the wealth of disk behavior.\n\nBased on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\nCalifornia Institute of Technology.
