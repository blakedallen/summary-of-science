Introduction\nFresnel Zone Plate (FZP) is a planar structure that can convert an incident plane wave into a\nspherical wave front that converges at a focal point. Depending on type of material of FZP, we\nhave FZP reflector (metal) or FZP lens (dielectric). In both types, this is diffraction not\nrefraction that causes convergence of spherical reflected/transmitted wave. A circular FZP\nconsists of a number of circular Fresnel zones that their radii are determined by:\nrn = ( F +\n\nn\n\n0\n\np\n\n)2\n\nn=0,1,2,...,N\n\nF2\n\n(1)\n\nWhere F is focal length, 0 is free-space wavelength and p is an integer. Circular ring between\ntwo adjacent circles is a Fresnel zone. If p=1, Fresnel zones will be called full-wave zones and if\np=2 these zones are half-wave zones and so on. In simple FZPs , odd/even zones are\nopaque/absorbing. Reflection form surface of such metallic Fresnel zones or transmission\nthrough a transparent dielectric Fresnel zones will result in amplitude amplification. Based on\nscalar diffraction theory and using geometry shown in Fig.1 we can calculate distribution of\nfield amplitude in focal plane as [1]:\n\nE( ) =\n.[\n\nrn\n0\n\n2 ( 1 + cos )e j (\nR\n\nt kR )\n\nrn\n\nF ( ) J 0 ( k sin ) d\n\n( 2)\n\nej n\n0\n\n1\n\nF ( )J 0 ( k sin ) d ]\n\nj n\n\nWhere exponent factor e\ndenote phase shift applied by plate material on incident wave ,\nrn and rn 1 are radii of n-th and n-1-th zones respectively , F ( ) is a function that indicates\nincident field distribution on plate and J 0 is first kind zero order Bessel function. So the far-field\npattern problem can be reduced to solving the integral:\n\nI( u ) =\n\na\n0\n\nF ( )J 0 ( u ) d\n\n( 3)\n\n\fEquation (3) cannot be calculated analytically and we must evaluate it numerically. Making this,\nwe have field distribution as a function of .\n\nFig.1: geometry for calculating far field distribution\nII. Modified FZP's\nIn simple FZP's , it is only a fraction (half) of plate surface that contributes in concentrating\nwavefront. In such conditions we need a plate with large area to increasing gain to a sufficient\nlevel. If the last zone have radius rN is equal to radius of the plate (D/2), solving equation (1) for\nN we have\nN=\n\n2D\n\n(\n\n0\n\nF 2 1\n) +\nD\n4\n\n(\n\nF\n)\nD\n\n(4)\n\nFrom above equation, it is apparent that for constant (F/D), N will increase directly with D / 0 .\nIn optical wavelengths and lower (e.g. x-ray), there will be a large number of Fresnel zones on a\nplate with a small diameter and without any modification we will have high gain. But at\ncentimeter wavelengths we will need large surface simple FZP's .Increasing FZP diameter will\nincrease weight and cost of lens or reflector. Thus we must increase number of Fresnel Zones\nwithout diameter increasing. To utilize the opaque zone apertures, Wiltse [2] replaced the\nreflecting (or absorbing) rings by phase-reversing (half-wave) dielectric rings. Based on this lens\nvarious FZP antennas with a radiation efficiency of 25-30% were developed and studied [2], [3].\nIn some other works [4] , this phase correction is caused by using rings with different r . By\ndividing each full-wave Fresnel zone to a number of subzones and making appropriate changes\nin them (e.g. changing depth by cutting groves) we will expect better results. By a ray tracing\nanalysis using geometry shown in Fig.3, we can drive appropriate depth of phase step (d)\nnecessary for a phase shift:\nd=\n\n2\n\n(\n\n0\n\nr\n\n)\n\n1\n\n(5)\n\n\fWhere r is the relative permeability of FZP lens material and d is phase step depth. This is\ncalled phase reversing zone plate. If a plane wave is normally incident on zone plate, the\nportions of radiation which pass through or reflect from various parts of the transparent\n(reflecting) zones all reach the selected focal point with phases which differ by less than onehalf period. Thus, the zone plate acts like a lens, producing a focusing action on the radiation it\ntransmits or reflects. In case of dividing each full zone to m phase step (subzone) Eq.(5) will\nhave this form:\nd=\n\nm\n\n(\n\n0\nr\n\n)\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\nHere the depth of s-th step is equal to sd ( S\n\nm ).\n\nFig.2: phase step in Fresnel lens/reflector\n\nIII. Calculations\nBased on equation (2) and using a Matlab code for numerical integration, we can calculate field\ndistribution around focal point. Equation (2) gives n-th zone contribution in total field amplitude\nat the focal point. If we divide each full-wave zone on dielectric FZP lens into m suzones and\ncutting groves with depths resulted from Eq. (6), then the total field amplitude at the focal point\nis equal to this weighted sum:\n\nATotal =\nj2 S\n\nn = N S =m 1\n\ne\n\nj2 S\nm\n\nA(n, S )\n\n(7)\n\nn =1 S =0\n\nWhere e m is phase shift related to S-th subzone and A(n,S) is S-th subzone contribution, and\nN is total number of full zones on the FZP. Using a Matlab code , radiation pattern for half-wave\n(m=2) and quarter-wave(m=4) FZP lens were calculated , results are shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4.\n\n\fFig.3: calculated radiation pattern (E-plane) for 2 step Fresnel lens.\nD=40cm and = 2.7 cm\n\nFig.4: calculated radiation pattern for 4-step Fresnel lens\nFor different F/D, D=40cm and = 2.7 cm\n\nIV. Experimental\nWe used Plexiglas (Polymetthylmethacrylate) with mass density of 1.19 g/cm3 as Lens material.\nWavelength\nis 2.7cm. For r measurement we applied two techniques, a Pseudo-Brewster's\nAngle Method [5] and a waveguide method, from both techniques it found to be 2.63. First we\n\n\ffabricated a Fresnel lens with m=2 (Fig.5 & Fig.6). Design parameters of this lens are listed in\ntable.1.\n\nFig.5: Dimensions of the fabricated Lens\n\nFig.6: Fabricated 2-step Fresnel lens\nTable.1: design parameters for fabricated 2-step FZP lens\nDiameter (cm)\n40\nF/D\n0.75\nN (number of full zones)\n2\nm (number of subzones on\n2\neach full zone)\nThickness (cm)\n4\n\nThen by cutting, we converted each zone into a concave surface, then covered it by Aluminum\nsheet, this is a segmented Fresnel reflector (Fig.7).\n\n\fFigure.7: segmented Fresnel lens\n\nUsing a horn antenna, radiation pattern of fabricated lens and reflector were measured (Fig.8 &\nFig.9)\n\n\fFig.8: E-plane radiation pattern for 2-step lens\nFreq. =11.1GHz.\n\nFig.9 : Measured radiation pattern for fabricated 4-step dielectric lens.\nFreq. =11.1 GHz\n\n\fFig.9:E-plane radiation pattern for segmented continuous Fresnel reflector (shown in fig2.) ,Freq.=\n11.1GHz\n\nThen we made another lens with m=4. an schematic view of this lens is shown in Fig.10 and\nFig.11.\n\nFig.10: side view of lens with m=4\n\n\fFig.11: Fabricated quarter-wave lens (m=4) with horn feed.\nV. Conclusions\nRadiation pattern and gain of fabricated lenses and reflector were made in K.N.T University of\ntechnology, Tehran, Iran. In these measurements, we used a horn feed with gain equal to 17.5\ndB. Radiation patterns are shown in Fig.8, Fig.9 and Fig.12. Other measurements are shown if\nTable.2. These results are in good agreement with calculated radiation patterns shown in Fig.3\nand Fig.4. For example, from Fig.3, calculated first sidelobe level is -16.7dB and measured\nvalue is -16.dB (Fig.8), also 3dB width of measured radiation pattern (Fig.8) and calculated\nradiation pattern (Fig.3) are very close to each other. The measured value is 5 degree and\ncalculated value is 4 degree.\n\nTable.2: Measured radiation pattern properties of fabricated items\nsystem\nPlane\n3dB width\nFirst\nFirst\nGain (dB)\n(deg.)\nsidelobe\nsidelobe\nLevel\nangle (deg.)\n(dB)\n2-step lens\nH\n5.5\n11\n-16\n29\n5.5\n+horn feed\nE\n4-step lens +\nH\n5.5\n15\n-22\n28\nhorn feed\nE\n5\n10.5\n-15.7\nSegmented\nH\n7\n10\n-10.3\n19.6\nreflector +\nE\n6\n9\n-13.4\nhorn feed\nAs can be seen from Table.2, segmented reflector has the worst results; it can be caused by\nshadowing effect due to the wooden fixtures applied for horn feed mounting (Fig.11).\nComparison between 2-step and 4-step lenses reveals that they have nearly same 3dB width, but\nthe 4-step lens has a sharper pattern than 2-step lens, the 2-step lens has higher gain. This is\nbecause the greater thickness of 4-step lens (Fig.10) in central region in comparison to 2-step\nlens (Fig.5).\nVI. Acknowledgement\nThe author wishes to thank R. Afzalzadeh and S. M.
