This means some additional\nsector is needed that fixes and stabilizes the values of the fundamental\nconstants of nature. We describe how such a sector can be constructed using\nthe so-called chaotic quantization method applied to a system of coupled map\nlattices. We restrict ourselves in this short note on verifying how our model\ncorrectly yields the numerical values of Yukawa and gravitational coupling\nconstants of a collection of heavy and light fermions using a simple principle,\nthe local minimization of vacuum energy.\n\nIntroduction\nString and M-theory predict an enormous amount of possible vacua after\ncompactification. In each of these vacua the cosmological constant as well as the\nfundamental constants of nature have different values. This is the so-called\n'landscape' picture. To select the right vacuum, one always can implement the\nanthropic point of view. But is an anthropic argument really the only solution?\nA natural idea to help out of this dilemma would be that their should be\nsome general principle provided by some form of an additional sector as yet not\nincluded in neither the ordinary standard model, nor in ordinary string theories.\nThis general principle should select, fix and stabilize the standard model\nparameters in the way we do observe them. Such a principle may be based on\nchaotic dynamics.\nThe important role of chaos and fractals in quantum field theories and\nstring theories has been emphasized in various recent papers and books, see for\nexample [1-15]. Many approaches have been suggested, most notably the works\nof M. S. El Naschie using the so-called E-\u221e theory of fractal space-time [12].\nOur approach here is based on coupled map lattices [21] simulating vacuum\nfluctuations, which seem to give us a hint at how this additional sector could\nlook like [8, 9]. In practice standard model parameters can be thought of as\nbeing fixed by so-called moduli fields [16]. If one knows the correct moduli\npotentials describing the world around us, then one knows the correct standard\nmodel parameters. So what could be a theory to construct these moduli\n*\n\u2663\n\nElectronic address: m.maher@qmul.ac.uk\nElectronic address: c.beck@qmul.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\fpotentials? In principle the potentials should follow from the embedding theory\nbut little is known in practice due to the enormous complexity inherent in the\ncurrent mainstream theories. But as with any unknown theory one can be guided\nby first trying to find an empirical model that does the correct thing, i.e.\nreproduces the observed value of the fine structure constant and other\nfundamental constants, and then later try to embed it into a larger context. The\ninteresting thing is that such an empirical model is possible [8, 9, 17]. There is a\nclass of highly nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems that seem to reproduce the\n'correct' standard model parameters by a simple selection mechanism - the\nminimization of vacuum energy.\nPhysically, the above-mentioned coupled chaotic dynamics can be regarded\nas describing rapidly fluctuating scalar fields associated with vacuum fluctuations.\nThese are vacuum fluctuations different from those of QED or QCD. The most\nnatural embedding is to associate the above chaotic vacuum fluctuations with the\ncurrently observed dark energy in the universe [17]. The chaotic fields, living in\nthe dark energy sector, generate effective potentials for moduli fields - just the\nsame moduli fields that are responsible for the fundamental constants of the\nstandard model of electroweak and strong interactions. The moduli fields then\nmove to the minima of the potentials generated by the chaotic fields, and fix the\nfundamental constants of nature [16]. This is why we are interested in local\nminima of the vacuum energy in this paper. The chaotic sector appears to provide\na possible answer to the question why we do observe certain numerical values of\nstandard model parameters in nature. It can be used to avoid anthropic\nconsiderations for fundamental constants. Moreover, it generates a small\ncosmological constant in a rather natural way [17].\n\nChaotic Quantization\nIn the chaotic quantization approach one replaces the Gaussian white noise of\nthe Parisi-Wu approach of stochastic quantization [18] by a deterministic\nchaotic process on a very small scale. A simple model is to generate the noise\nby Tchebyscheff maps TN . In nonlinear dynamics, TN are standard examples of\nchaotic maps, just as the harmonic oscillator is a standard example in linear\ndynamics. One has T2 (\u03c6) = 2\u03c6 2 \u2212 1 for the lowest order N=2. Most important for\nour purposes is the property that the TN have least higher-order correlations\namong all smooth systems conjugated to a Bernoulli shift, and are in that sense\nclosest to Gaussian white noise, as close as possible for a smooth deterministic\nsystem [19, 20]. Any other map has more higher-order correlations. What does\nthis mean for chaotic quantization? Actually the TN are automatically selected as\nmost ideal candidates if we argue that Gaussian white noise is chosen to be\ngenerated in nature by something deterministic chaotic on the smallest\nquantization scales, which aims at making the small-scale deviations from\nordinary quantum mechanics as small as possible.\n\n2\n\n\fCoupled Chaotic Map Lattices\nNow that we assumed that the noise fields used for quantization are dynamical\nin origin, it'd be plausible to allow for some coupling between neighboured\nnoise fields. Physically it is most reasonable that the coupling has a Laplacian\nform, since this is the most relevant coupling form in quantum field and string\ntheories. This leads to coupled map lattices of the nearest-neighbour coupling\nform. We end up in the 1-dimensional case with coupled Tchebyscheff maps of\norder N of the form\na\n\u03c6 ni +1 = (1-a) TN ( \u03c6 ni ) +s (TNb (\u03c6 ni+1 ) + TNb (\u03c6 ni\u22121 )),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i is a 1-dimensional lattice coordinate, a \u2208 [0, 1] is a coupling constant, s\n= \u00b1 1, and b takes on values 0 or 1 ( T0 (\u03c6) = \u03c6, T1 (\u03c6) = T(\u03c6 ) ). Our choices\nthroughout all the calculations leading to the presented results below were s=1\n(diffusive coupling) and b=0 (backward coupling). The above chaotic dynamics\nis deterministic chaotic spatially extended, and strongly nonlinear. The field\nvariable \u03c6 ni is physically interpreted in terms of rapidly fluctuating virtual\nmomenta in units of some arbitrary maximum momentum scale [9].\n\nSome Numerical Calculations\n1-Dimensional Case\nWe used equation (1) to calculate the self-energy V\u2261 V (\u03c6 )\n\na\n\nof the above\n\nintroduced spatially extended chaotic coupled map lattice in one space-time\ndimension. We implemented random initial conditions \u03c6 i0 = cos \u03c0 u , u \u2208 [0,1] and\nalso periodic boundary conditions that can be expressed as \u03c61n = \u03c6 nI where I labels\nthe last site on the linear lattice.\nIn the N=2 case, V ( \u03c6 ) can be written as\n3\nV2 (\u03c6 ) = \u03c6 \u2212 2 3 \u03c6 , where we imposed that V\u00b1 N ( \u03c6 ) = m \u222b T( \u03c6 )d\u03c6 , which is an essential\nchoice to facilitate the calculation of self-energy [8, 9]. Assuming ergodicity,\nexpectations V (\u03c6 ) a for a given coupling parameter (a) are numerically calculable\nas time averages\nV(\u03c6 )\n\na\n\n=\n\n1 M I\nV ( \u03c6 ni ) .\n\u2211\n\u2211\nlim\nM\nI\nM \u2192\u221e , I \u2192\u221e\nn =1 i =1\n\nFor a \u2192 0 one numerically observes the scaling behaviour\nV(\u03c6) a \u2212 V(\u03c6) 0 = a F( N ) (log(a))\nlog( a ) with period log N 2 and\n\nwhere\n\nF ( N ) is\n\na periodic function of\n\nV(\u03c6 ) 0 = 0 for N=2 [9]. Such a log periodic\n\nscaling is manifested in our results shown in Fig (1) below and was analytically\nproved in [25]. From the periodicity it follows that if there is some local\nminimum of the potential at bi then there is also a minimum at b i / N 2 L , where\nL is an integer. In other words, minima are only determined modulo 4 for N=2.\nIn one period shown in fig (2), and if we magnify enough (calculate for\nsufficiently dense values of the coupling a) and use sufficiently high values of\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fthe number of lattice sites and the number of iterations, one remarkably\nobserves 9 different minima that coincide with Yukawa and gravitational\ncouplings of 9 standard model fermions modulo 4. One observes that the\nminima with i = 2, 6, 10 turn out to coincide with Yukawa couplings modulo 4\nof the heavy fermions \u03c4, b, c according to the formula\n2\nb i = 1 4 \u03b1 2 (m H + 2mf ) . (mf m w ) . 4L where f = \u03c4, b, c, respectively, m H is the\nHiggs mass taken to be 154 GeV [9], m w is the mass of the W-boson, \u03b1 2 (E) is\nf\n\nthe running weak coupling constant [22], and Lf is a suitable integer for a particular\nfermion f. The results are almost independent of the Higgs mass [9]. For the\n\nlight fermions one observes that the self-energy has local minima for couplings\nthat coincide with gravitational couplings modulo 4. We numerically observe\nfor i = 4, 7, 8, 9 that b i = 1 4 (m f m Pl )2 .4L .2 where f = e, d, u, s, respectively.\nHere m Pl denotes the Planck mass. Solving for mf, one can thus get fermion\nmass predictions modulo 2. The relevant power of 2 (the value of Lf in the\nabove equations of bi ) can then be obtained from other minima and additional\nsymmetry considerations [9]. We also observe the minima with i = 3, 11 which\nmay yield neutrino mass predictions. As for i = 5, it is assumed to account for\nYukawa interaction of the top quark while i = 1 is expected to host a doublet to\naccount for the heaviest neutrino and the muon [8, 9]. A list of the predicted\nfermion masses corresponding to the confirmed local minima can be found in\nsections 8.6 and 8.7 in [9] and the excellent agreement (3-4 digits) with the\nexperimentally observed masses is remarkable.\nActually it was argued in [8, 9] that there are 11 minima. We have now\nrepeated these calculations with much higher computer power which allowed us to\ndo highly precise calculations (see typical samples in figs 3, 4) around the values of\nthe fermion couplings assumed in [8, 9]. Our calculations returned a firm\nconfirmation of only 9 of them. Literally all the minima suggested in [8, 9] were\nconfirmed except for b1 and b5. At b1 and b5 we got something more like an\ninflexion point (an unstable stationary point) rather than a typical stable minimum.\nFurther calculations have been performed for different sets of initial-conditions as\nwell as at minima valleys of lower couplings (lower Lf ) in an attempt to eliminate\nthe ambiguities for light fermions. So far the existence of the minima b1 and b5 is\nunconfirmed. Finally we should say that the probability of such a very precise\nmatching between our calculations and the experimental data for only two fermion\nmasses (e.g. e and \u03c4) to be a result of mere random coincidence is of the order of\none in a million.\nf\n\nD-Dimensional Case\nThe coupled map lattices (CMLs) described in (1) can be studied on lattices of\narbitrary dimension. We generalized the investigations and the numerical\ncalculations of the 1-dimensional case to higher space-time dimensions\n( 4 \u2265 D >1). If we take the D=4 case as an example, the CMLs can be written as:\n\n4\n\n\fa\n\u03c6 hn ,+i1, j, k = (1 \u2212 a ) T(\u03c6 hn , i , j, k ) + (\u03c6 hn , i +1, j, k + \u03c6 hn , i \u22121, j,k + \u03c6 hn , i , j\u22121, k + \u03c6 hn , i , j+1, k\n8\nh , i , j, k \u22121\nh , i , j , k +1\n+ \u03c6n\n+ \u03c6n\n+ \u03c6 hn +1, i , j, k + \u03c6 hn \u22121, i , j, k )\n(3)\nLike in the D=1 case, we implemented periodic boundary conditions given by:\n\u03c61n, i , j, k = \u03c6 nH , i , j, k , \u03c6 nh ,1, j, k , = \u03c6 hn , I , j, k , \u03c6 hn , i ,1, k = \u03c6 hn , i , J , K and \u03c6 hn , i , j,1 = \u03c6 hn , i , j, K where H, I, J\nand K are the last space-time sites along each relevant space-time direction on the\ncubic lattice. In this case, TN (\u03c6 ), VN (\u03c6 ), \u03c6 0 have exactly the same form as in the 1D\n\ncase and the self energy V( \u03c6 )\n\nV(\u03c6)\n\na\n\n=\n\nlim\n\na\n\nis given by\n\nM\u2192\u221e , H\u2192\u221e , I\u2192\u221e , J \u2192\u221e , K \u2192\u221e\n\n1\nMHIJK\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\u2211\u2211\u2211\u2211\u2211 V(\u03c6\nn =1 j=1 k =1 i =1 i =1\n\nh ,i , j,k\nn\n\n)\n\n( 4)\n\nWe observed a log-periodic behaviour similar to, however apparently\nsmoother than, the D = 1 case. This is demonstrated in fig (5). We magnified\none period of the log-periodic curve in the small coupling scaling region, which\nis identical to scaling region considered in the D=1 case. We adopted an\noptimal large-enough combination of the number of lattice sites and the number\nof iterations to ensure reasonable statistics. The gross calculations of all the\n( 4 \u2265 D >1) three cases took about 8000 hours of parallel computing time on the\ne-science computing cluster at QMUL which is part of GridPP; the UK's grid\ncomputing facility. To our surprise, rather than obtaining some structure, we\ngot a single smooth structure-free broad minimum for all 4 \u2265 D >1 cases, see fig\n(6) for the D = 4 case as an example. We couldn't relate the corresponding\ncoupling of about 0.000358(4) to any of the known particle masses using\nsimilar arguments to that used in the D = 1 case. For the time being, the only\nhypothesis we have for the observed smoothness in the D >1 cases as compared\nto the wriggling fractal shape in the D =1 case (fig (2)) is that this might be an\neffect of what we can call an extended version of Nash embedding [23, 24]. If\ncorrect, this is rather a topological-geometrical argument to be complemented\nin future with a concrete physical explanation.\n\nConclusion\nWe have studied a chaotic scalar field that lives in one space-time dimension as\na model of vacuum fluctuations. Expectations of the self energy can be used to\ngenerate potentials that can fix the fundamental constants of nature. The\ngeneralization of these fields to higher space-time dimensions didn't yield any\ninteresting structure in the shape of self energy. The nonlinear dynamics given\nby eq. (1) appears to distinguish certain numerical values of coupling constants\nthat do coincide with known standard model coupling constants with very high\nprecision [8, 9]. A random coincidence can really be excluded. In this way the\nchaotic fields can help to select the 'correct' vacuum out of an enormous\nnumber of possibilities to shape the world around us. Our numerics shows that\nanthropic arguments for standard model parameters are most likely to be\nwrong. This further emphasizes the physical importance of the chaotic\n5\n\n\fquantization method and more importantly the deep significance of the\nunderlying non-linear dynamics given by eq.(1).\n\nFigures:\n3.6\n\n-0.004\n\nD = 1, N = 2\n\u0394 a = variable\nlattice size = 10000\nnumber of iterations = 100000\n\n3.4\n\n<V(\u03c6)>a\n\nl log4 ll<V2(\u03c6)>all\n\n3.2\n\nD =1, N =2\n\u0394a = 0.000001\nlattice size = 20000,\nnumber of iterations = 200000\n\n-0.005\n\n3.0\n2.8\n\nb1\n-0.006\n\n-0.007\n\n2.6\n\nb2\nb3\n\n2.4\n\n-0.008\n\nb4\n\nb10\n\nb5\n\nb8\n\nb6\n\nb7\n\n2.2\n-5.5\n\n-5.0\n\n-4.5\n\n-4.0\n\n-0.009\n\n-3.5\n\n0.0002\n\nlog 4a\n\n0.0003\n\n0.0004\n\nFig (2)\n-0.00799\n\n-0.00757\n\nD=1, N=2\n\u0394 a=0.00000002\nlattice size =40000,\nn umber of iterations =400000\n\n-0.00758\n\n-0.00801\n\n-0.00760\n\n-0.00802\n\n-0.00761\n\n-0.00803\n\n-0.00762\n\n-0.00804\n\nb 4 =0.0003066(2)\n\nm e = 0.5117(8)\n\n-0.00763\n0.000300\n\n0.000302\n\n0.000304\n\n0.000306\n\n0.000308\n\nD=1,N=2\n\u0394 a=0.000000025\nlattice size=40000,\nnumber of iterations=400000\n\n-0.00800\n\n<V>\n\n-0.00759\n\n<V(\u03c6)>a\n\n0.0005\n\na\n\nFig (1)\n\n-0.00805\n\n0.000310\n\n0.000312\n\nb 9=0.000481(2)\n\nm s= 164.4(2)\n\n0.000472 0.000474 0.000476 0.000478 0.000480 0.000482 0.000484 0.000486 0.000488 0.000490\n\na\n\na\n\nFig (3)\n\nFig (4)\n-0.003\n\n3.6\n\n-0.004\n\n3.4\n\nD = 4, N = 2\n\u0394 a = 10 -6\n\nD = 4, N = 2\n\u0394 a = variable\n\n3.2\n\n-0.005\n\n4\n\nlattice size = 204,\nnumber of iterations = 1600000\n\nlattice size = 15\nnumber of iterations = 600000\n3.0\n\n<V(\u03c6)>a\n\nl log4 ll<V2(\u03c6)>all\n\nb11\n\nb9\n\n2.8\n\n-0.006\n\n-0.007\n\n2.6\n\n-0.008\n\n2.4\n\n-0.009\n\n2.2\n\n-0.010\n-5.0\n\n-4.5\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.5\n\nC = 0.000358(4)\n0.0002\n\nlog 4a\n\n0.0003\n\n0.0004\n\n0.0005\n\na\n\nFig (5)\n\nFig (6)\n\n6\n\n0.0006\n\n\fFigure Captions\nFig. 1 log 4 V2 (\u03c6 ) a versus log4 a for the one-dimensional chaotic CML\ndescribed by eq.
