ENUM is an innovation in the domain name system (DNS). It\nstarts with numerical domain names that are used to query DNS name servers.\nThe servers respond with address information found in DNS records. This can\nbe telephone numbers, email addresses, fax numbers, SIP addresses, or other\ninformation. The concept is to use a single number in order to obtain a plethora\nof contact information.\nBy convention, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) ENUM Working\nGroup determined that an ENUM number would be the same numerical string as\na telephone number. In addition, the assignee of an ENUM number would be the\nassignee of that telephone number. But ENUM could work with any numerical\nstring or, in fact, any domain name. The IETF is already working on using E.212\nnumbers with ENUM.\nENUM creates multiple policy problems. What impact does ENUM have upon\nthe public telephone network and the telephone numbering resource? For\nexample, does this create a solution or a problem for number portability? If\nENUM truly is a DNS innovation, how does it square with the classic difficulties\nexperienced with DNS and ICANN? Is ENUM, while presenting a convergence\nsolution, also encumbered with the policy problems of both the DNS and\ntelephony worlds?\nIETF ENUM proponents suggest that ENUM needs a single unified database\nadministered through national and international government sanctioned\nmonopolies. The IETF took the unusual step of requesting that the International\nTelecommunications Union (ITU) regulate an aspect of the Internet, that is,\nparticipate and have authority over the international ENUM service provider. But\nthis notion of establishing a new communications monopoly collides with the\nderegulatory efforts of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the attempts to\nprivatize DNS through ICANN, and US policy that the Internet should be left\nunregulated. ENUM is an unproven innovation with no evidence of commercial\nviability. It faces a strongly competitive market of other directory assistance\ninnovations and services. Proponents are asking governments to sanction one\ncompetitor over others.\nENUM offers two lessons. First, involving the government in a standards\nprocess is fraught with problems and delays. It starts with the clich\u00e9 of having\ntoo many cooks in the kitchen, producing a mediocre cake at best. And it ends\nwith a cumbersome bureaucratic process resulting in fatal delay and ultimately\ncollapsing in upon itself. Similar efforts in the past rose to grandiose levels and\nfailed. These include X.500 and OSI.\nSecond, a number by any other name remains a number. A significant portion of\nthe DNS wars has been focused on resolving who has the right to a name. Is it\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 2\n\n\ffirst come, first serve, a trademark holder, someone using the domain name\npursuant to free speech rights, or perhaps some other right? With ENUM, the\nquestion presented is who has the right to a numerical string. ENUM attempts to\nresolve this question by convention, concluding that the assignee of a telephone\nnumber has rights to an ENUM number. But an ENUM number is not a\ntelephone number. A telephone number is an address used on a telephone\nnetwork to reach a telephone. An ENUM number is a token used to access a\ndatabase. Transferring a numerical string from one context to another does not\nlikewise transfer the rules and regulations of the original context. Rules and\nregulations created for telephone numbers assume a particular purpose in a\nparticular context; they do not apply to numerical strings in a foreign context with\na different purpose. It is illogical and dangerous to transfer the policy concerning\none type of number to a different type of number. This means, among other\nthings, that the regulatory authority over telephone numbers has no more\njurisdiction over ENUM numbers then when telephone numbers are used to rent\nvideos or access savings clubs at the grocery store.\nUS policy has been to keep information technology unregulated to permit it to\ninnovate at the speed of the market and not at the pace of bureaucracy. Yet\nENUM proponents beg for government entanglement. It would be\nunprecedented for the government to sanction a monopoly for something as\nunproven as ENUM where the appropriateness of a government monopoly has\nnot been demonstrated. Were such government involvement in fact approved,\nthe delay experienced would likely be fatal to the innovation.\nThere are those who are strong advocates of an ENUM unified database. An\nENUM unified database can likely be achieved by private industry through some\nlevel of a joint venture devoid of government entanglement. This is the best\nhope for ENUM achieving the goal of a swift implementation.\n\nENUM\nENUM is an IETF proposed standard1 (RFC 29162) created by the IETF ENUM\nWorking Group.3 It is an Internet domain name system (DNS) innovation.4\n1\n\nSee S. Bradner, IETF RFC 2026, The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3 (October 1996)\n(hereinafter RFC 2026) (explaining IETF process and difference between proposed, draft, and\nInternet standards), at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt.\n2\n\nP.

A ENUM number is entered, it queries the a DNS name server\nwhich then responds with telephone numbers, IP telephony numbers, fax\nnumbers, e-mail addresses, and telephone number after 5:00 p.m. on\nweekends.5 It can also provide information about the priority pursuant to which\nthe record owner wishes to be contacted. Thus, having only a single identifier, a\nuser could acquire all of the contact information for an individual.6\nENUM numbers are converted by ENUM devices into domain names, and then\nused to query the domain name system. If an ENUM record exists, then the\ndatabase produces the contact information. The ENUM device is on the Internet,\nthe query is over the Internet, and the ENUM database is on the Internet. It can\nbe used in conjunction with a multitude of applications on or off the Internet\nincluding telephony, email, fax, and others.7\n\nUS Study Group A Ad-Hoc, ENUM Questions, p. 5 (March 23, 2001) (hereinafter NeuStar, Inc.,\nUS Study Group A Ad-Hoc,) (stating \"ENUM is a DNS-based service\"); NeuStar, ENUM\nFrequently Asked Questions, FAQ-7 (n.d.)

Such a\nNAPTR record could look like \"IN NAPTR 10 10 \"u\" \"Reachme+E2U\" \\\n\"!LDAP:\\\\dap1.zcorporation.com\\cn=\\!\" .

The assignee of a telephone number\nwould be the assignee of an ENUM number.9 This achieves several goals. It\ncreates a global standard form for ENUM numbers - they could be anything. It\ncreates a standard for how ENUM numbers shall be assigned. It also means that\nENUM numbers, which are domain names, are numeric (unlike most domain\nnames which utilize letters and words), can be entered into telephone number\npads, are linguistically neutral, and can take advantage of the familiarity of the\npublic with telephone numbers.10\nENUM would function as follows: A user in Washington, D.C. may wish to reach\nthe reach the Joe.\n\u2022 The user inputs into an ENUM enabled device the ENUM number 555-1212.\n\u2022 The ENUM device expands the ENUM number into the same numerical string\nas the full E.164 number: 1-1-202-555-1212.11\n\n8\n\nThe use of \"foo\" as a TLD is an informal IETF convention indicating that the TLD is unspecified.\nSee D. Eastlake, C. Manros, E. Rayond, IETF Information RFC 3092, Etymology of \"Foo\" (April 1,\n2001) (explaining origins and use of term \"foo\" in IETF documents; \"foo\" is used \"as a sample\nname for absolutely anything, esp. programs and files.\"), at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt.\n9\n\nSeveral presentations describe the purpose of ENUM as being a means of finding a device on\nthe Internet using a telephone number. See Shockey, ITU-T, supra note 4, Slide 5; ENUM.ORG\n> Welcome Page (visited March 27, 2001) (\"ENUM was developed as a solution to the question\nof how to find services on the Internet using only a telephone number, and how telephones, which\nhave an input mechanism limited to twelve keys on a keypad, can be used to access Internet\nservices.\") at http://www.enum.org; Patrik Faltstrom, ENUM Technical Issues, ITU ENUM Work\nShop, slide 12 (Jan 17, 2001) (hereinafter Faltstrom, ENUM Technical Issues).

The device would create the\nENUM number domain name <2.1.2.1.5.5.5.2.0.2.1.1.foo>.\nThis domain name would then be sent to a designated ENUM name server on\nthe Internet. A DNS query would be conducted for each zone of the domain\nname.12\nIf a record exists, the database would produce the result that could, for\nexample, direct the user first to call Joe's IP telephony number, second to\ncontact Joe's e-mail address, or finally to call Joe's number.13 The result\nwould also reflect the preference of the person on how that person prefers to\nbe contacted.14 If no record exists, the user will receive an error message\nsimilar to receiving an error message when requesting a webpage that does\nnot exist.15\nBased on the user, the person the user desires to contact, and the ENUM\ninformation provided, the communication would then be set up by other\napplications (not by ENUM). If the information used is a URI, an additional\nDNS lookup must be conducted to get the IP address.\n\nIn order for ENUM to work, there must be an ENUM enabled device. All a device\nwould need is a bit of software, meaning any device capable of running the\nsoftware that has Internet access could be enabled. The device would receive\nthe ENUM number, convert it into a domain name, and then conduct the query. It\nis edge technology at either the originator's or the terminator's edge. ENUM\ndevices would be programmed to point to a designated Internet name server16\n\n12\n\nSee Brown, ENUM Service Reference Model, supra note 4, Sec. 6.1, at\nhttp://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-enum-operation-02.txt.\n13\n\nSee NeuStar FAQ, supra note 4, FAQ-1 (stating that \"once the authoritative name server is\nfound, ENUM retrieves relevant NAPTR Resource records . . .\"), at\nhttp://www.enum.org/information/files/enum_faq.pdf.

The software generally has a series of fields for such data as the users\nname, e-mail address, and other values. There is generally two fields for name servers, where\nthe IP number of two different servers is stored. When the user sends data using a domain\nname, the software consults the pre assigned name server for the IP number associated with that\ndomain name. If the first name server fails, the second name server can be consulted. If the\nsecond name server fails, the address cannot be resolved and the communication fails.\nGenerally, while the name server fields are configured by the ISP, they can be reconfigured by\nthe user. The user can point to and receive data from any name server the user chooses.\nAlternative DNS systems have been developed and, in order to participate, all users had to do\nwas enter the IP number of the alternative DNS system and point to the alternative name server.\nIn this manner, unofficial domains such as .web can work.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 6\n\n\fwhere it would have access to an ENUM database.

This\nissue marks an area of significant contention within the ENUM community.\nThere is strong consensus in favor of the technical aspects of the protocol,\nhowever, consensus with regard to ENUM administration does not appear to\nexist.\nPursuant to RFC 291618 and the ITU ENUM Liaison,19 the database is to be\nadministered in a hierarchical model with a single international database pointing\nto single national databases for each telephone country code, that in turn point to\nauthorized service providers. This model is broken down into tiers, with Tier 0\nbeing the international level, tier 1 being the national level, and tier 2 being the\ncompetitive service provider levels. The hierarchical model is being actively\ndiscussed by the ENUM industry and the ITU, and is evolving.\nTier 0: The administrative contact for the international database is the Internet\nArchitecture Board20 and the technical contact is RIPE NCC.21 The international\ndatabase administered by RIPE NCC will be located in the E164.arpa domain.22\nThe ITU will supply information on the E.164 database, encourage member\nstates to participate, indicate to RIPE-NCC who the authorized provider of a\n17\n\nFor a description of potential call flows, see Lind, Callflows, supra note 4, at\nhttp://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lind-enum-callflows-01.txt; Ad Hoc ENUM Report, supra\nnote 2, Sec. 6.2, at http://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm..\n18\n\nRFC 2916, supra note 2, at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2916.txt.\n\n19\n\nITU, Liaison to IETF/ISOC on ENUM (October 2000) (hereinafter Liaison), at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/wp1-39_rev1.htm.

As\nthe Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates by\ncontract,32 requiring all domain name registrants to agree to certain terms, ENUM\nregistrants may be bound by certain terms and conditions of the Tier-1 ENUM\nservice provider including dispute resolution.33 Registrants could update their\nrecords to reflect changes, but if the information is held in the DNS NAPTR\nrecords, the information could not be updated in real time. It could only be\nupdated at the speed of DNS refresh.34\nThis hierarchical model35 creates an open platform where any service provider\nwho receives authorization may participate. The full extent of what it means to\nbe authorized and who issues the authorization is undefined and could impact on\nhow open a system this model is. The database here would be unified and\nvalidated at Tier 1.\nThe rationale for this model is that it is based on the DNS and the DNS requires\na single authoritative root for each node in the DNS tree.36 If multiple roots\nexisted, the question arises concerning how an ENUM device would know which\ndatabase to look into and how an ENUM device could resolve inconsistent\nresults from inconsistent databases. It is argued that a single root is required to\nensure the integrity of ENUM.37\nAlternative ENUM models suggest that ENUM can be provisioned as a wholly\ncompetitive service without need for a government sanctioned unified database.\nDetailed examination of the rational in favor of this argument will be visited in the\nIssues section below. In short, this contingent argues that ENUM is standardized\ndata in an open database. Multiple ENUM services located in different domains\ntherefore presents no significant challenge.

Users would then\nquery the \".ph\" name server with that domain name and receive the current\naddressing information for the registrant. If the user wanted to call John Doe, the\nuser would enter the domain name John.Doe.ph and, if there were a record,\nreceive the lasted telephone number.55 In this way, it is almost identical to\nENUM, with the exception that the single identifier appears to be a domain name\nof the registrants choice such as their name, as opposed to a public telephone\nnumber.\nThere are multiple Internet directory assistance projects. Essentially, online\nwhite pages or 411, these companies acquire subscriber list information pursuant\nto Sec. 222 of the Telecommunications Act56 and upload the information as a\nsearchable database.

There are current negotiations between phone\nmanufacturers and Palm Pilot type device manufacturers concerning\npartnerships.59 Wireless phones are being built with Palm Pilot type address\nbooks built in, giving ready access in the telephony device to known addresses of\nacquaintances. Having this information already in the phone could make ENUM\nservices superfluous for most communications.\nOther Alternatives\nThere is a set of services that seeks to address the problem of how to find\nsomeone with a single address and building multiple communications\napplications on top of that address. If the user knows the single address, the\nuser can use fax, telephony, messaging, or other applications to contact the\ndesired individual at that address. This strategy is followed by SIP60 and Instant\nMessaging.\nIn addition, the IETF's Telephony Routing Over IP (TRIP) protocol can be used to\nget telephony calls from the IP network to the PSTN. The protocol calls for the\ncreation of a peer-to-peer network where participating servers announce\navailable routes and gateways from an IP network to telephone numbers on the\nPSTN.61\nWhat ENUM is Not\nENUM is not an application. ENUM is a database. It is queried with an ENUM\nnumber and responds with contact data. Consequently, ENUM is not telephony.\nENUM can be used is association with a multitude of applications including\ntelephony, email,62 fax, and others.63\n\n59\n\nSee Sprint PCS Press Release: Sprint PCS Phone QCP-6035 by Kyocera and Mobile\nConnectivity Kits for Palm Handhelds Are First in a Series of Palm Powered Solutions Offered By\nSprint PCS (Apr. 11, 2001), at http://www.prnewswire.com/cgibin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=153400&TICK=PALM&STORY=/www/story/04-192001/0001473179&EDATE=Apr+11,+2001.\n60\n\nTony Rutkowski, ENUM Directory Services in the Marketplace, DTI Workshop on ENUM, Slide\n6 (Jun. 5, 2001) (noting \"Email or SIP addresses may be more attractive.\")\n61\n\nJ.

ENUM does not interact\nwith the SS7 network. An ENUM device is on the Internet, the ENUM query is\nover the Internet, and the ENUM database is a part of the Internet DNS\ndatabase. Once the user obtains address information, the user may set up a call\non the SS7 network, but that is separate and after the use of the ENUM protocol.\n\nIssues\nENUM is described as a convergence technology between the PSTN and the\nInternet world. This can make things messy. It may mean that policy\nconsiderations must consider the implications for both the regulated PSTN world\nand the unregulated Internet world. In this way, ENUM could be described more\nas a collision than convergence, bring both the best and the worst of both worlds\ntogether.\nA Number by Any Other Name...\nEssential to ENUM is the connection of telephone numbers to ENUM numbers.\nThis connection determines who has the right to assignment of an ENUM\nnumber and what government authority has jurisdiction over ENUM\nadministration. If the connection is, however, broken, ENUM will be confronted\nwith multiple challenging problems.\nAn ENUM number is a domain name. It could be anything that a domain name\ncould be. The IETF ENUM Working Group was attempting to solve the problem\nof how to find devices on the Internet with two parameters. First, the IETF ENUM\nWG wanted to be able to do this using a numeric keypad. This limits an ENUM\nnumber to a numerical string. But it could still be any numerical string. Next, the\nIETF ENUM WG wanted to take advantage of phone numbers.65 But the IETF\nENUM WG could have select other types of numbers, as is demonstrated by\ncurrent ENUM work considering the use of E.212 numbers with ENUM.66 The\nIETF ENUM WG determined, by convention, an assignee of an ENUM number\nwould use the same numerical string as the assignee's public telephone number.\n\n64\n\nBrown, ENUM Service Reference Model, supra note 4, Sec. 4, at http://www.ietf.org/internetdrafts/draft-ietf-enum-operation-02.txt (stating \"It is up to the client initiating the service request to\nsort through the set of NAPTR records to determine which services are appropriate for the\nintended action.\")\n65\n\nSee footnote 10, and accompanying text.\n\n66\n\nGopal Dommety, Paddy Nallur, Viren Malaviya, Niranjan Segal, IETF Internet Draft, E.212\nnumber and DNS (June 2001) (stating \"This draft is adaptation of RFC 2916 to E.212 numbers.\"),\nat http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dommety-e212-dns-00.txt.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 14\n\n\fAn ENUM number, however, is not itself a telephone number. A telephone\nnumber is an address used on the telephone network to reach a telephone.67 An\nENUM number is not an address. There is no communications device that is\nassigned and can be reached by using an ENUM number. You cannot set up a\ncommunications with an ENUM number itself. An ENUM number is a \"token\"\nused to query a database. This is the only function of an ENUM number. The\ndatabase contains the addresses that can then be used in communications.\nA numerical string standing by itself is a numerical string and is nothing more out\nof context. It becomes a type of number in a particular context. 5550100 is a\nnumerical string. Use this number to reach a telephone on the telephone\nnetwork and it is a telephone number. Use this number to access money in a\nbank account and it is a bank account number. Use this number to access an\nATM and it is a PIN. What type of number a numerical string is, depends upon\nthe context in which it is used. Outside of that context, it is no longer that type of\nnumber. Simply because two numerical strings have the same value does not\nmake them the same type of number.\nGood examples are other databases tied to telephone numbers such as grocery\nstore savings plans and video rental membership. If you forget your card you\ncan give the cashier your phone number and you have access to the relevant the\ndatabase. The mere use of a phone number in a database does not give the\nFCC jurisdiction over grocery store savings plans or video clubs.68 The reason\nwhy is, in that given context, the numerical string has the same value as a\ntelephone number but is, in fact, a savings plan number. The use of the\ntelephone number serves as a pneumonic device but has no further connection\nto the telephone network. There is a difference between something being a\ntelephone number and having the same value as (same numerical string) a\ntelephone number.\nMembers of the ENUM industry implicitly recognize this point. Documents that\ndescribe ENUM discuss it as transferring one number into another number. The\nindustry repeatedly uses such works as mapping,69 tied,70 translating,71\n67\n\nFederal Standard 1037C, Definition: telephone number (Aug. 23, 1996) (stating \"telephone\nnumber: The unique network address that is assigned to a telephone user, i.e., subscriber, for\nrouting telephone calls.\"), at http://glossary.its/bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-036/_5369.htm.\n68\n\nWhile it is true that the ENUM database is unlike the others cited in that the ENUM database\ncontains communications data, it is also true that a great deal of that communications data is data\nthat the FCC lacks jurisdiction over, including e-mail addresses, web addresses, IP telephony\naddresses, physical addresses, and other personal identifying information. To suggest that the\nFCC has jurisdiction just because a phone number is in the database would also be to suggest\nthat the US Post Office would have jurisdiction over ENUM because the database would likely\ncontain physical addresses as well.\n69\n\nBrown, ENUM Service Reference Model, supra note 4, Sec. 5.1, at http://www.ietf.org/internetdrafts/draft-ietf-enum-operation-02.txt; SS8 Links Multiple PSTN and IP Devices to Single Phone\nNumber, COMMUNICATIONS DAILY, p. 7, Jun. 25, 2001.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 15\n\n\ftransforming,72 and converting73 to describe this process. ENUM is also\ndescribed as a \"telephone number-based Internet directory service.\"74 All of this\nrecognizes the process of taking one numerical string out of its original context\nand using it in a new context.\nThe argument that ENUM numbers and telephone numbers are distinct is\nsupported by the fact that the two types of numbers are operationally distinct.\nTelephone numbers can operate without ENUM; telephone numbers can cease\nto operate regardless of ENUM. ENUM numbers, which can be anything, can\ntechnically be created without a corresponding telephone number. An ENUM\nnumber can be deleted from the DNS without an affect on the telephone number.\nTelephone numbers are used on the telephone network; ENUM numbers are\nused on the Internet.\nThis is highlighted by one of the primary issues for ENUM: what happens when a\ntelephone number is disconnected? The ENUM industry is working hard on\ndeveloping relationships so that ENUM service providers can be informed when\na telephone number is terminated.75 If the numbers were the same, then when a\ntelephone number ceased to exist, the ENUM number could no longer function.\nThe fact that the ENUM number can technically live on when no corresponding\ntelephone number is in existence demonstrates that they are distinct. The\nconnection between telephone numbers and ENUM numbers has to be\nestablished by convention because it is not established by law or technical\nrequirement.\nThe reasons why the distinction is important are jurisdiction, authority, and rights\nto a number. If ENUM numbers are telephone numbers, then they possibly fall\nunder the jurisdiction of telephone authorities. If, however, ENUM numbers are\nnot telephone numbers, then they do not necessarily fall under the jurisdiction of\ntelephone authorities. In addition, there would be no right to an ENUM number\nbased on being the assignee of a telephone number. This could complicate\nconflicts over ENUM number assignments and who has authority to set up Tier 1\nENUM providers.\n70\n\nPfautz, ENUM Administrative Process, supra note 4, Sec. 1, at http://www.ietf.org/drafts/draftpfautz-yu-enum-adm-01.txt; Penn Pfautz, ENUM Administration, Slide 2 (Feb. 12, 2001), at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/workshopusafeb12-13/pfautz.htm.\n71\n\nShockey, SGA, supra note 10, slide 2; Marc Robins, ENUM's Got Your Number, INTERNET\nTELEPHONY, Jun. 2001, at http://www.tmcnet.com/it/0601/0601ms.htm.\n72\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 2, at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm.\n73\n\nSS8 Links Multiple PSTN and IP Devices to Single Phone Number, COMMUNICATIONS DAILY, p.\n7, Jun. 25, 2001.\n\n74\n\nBrown, ENUM Service Reference Model, supra note 4, Secs. 3, 4 (emphasis added), at\nhttp://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-enum-operation-02.txt.\n75\n\nRanalli, Tier-1 ENUM, supra note 33, Secs. 4.2, 6.3.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 16\n\n\fThis is an intriguing issue of rights to numbers. Rights to one type of number do\nnot transfer to another type of number simply because the numerical strings are\nthe same. Otherwise, rules and regulations concerning one type of number in\none context developed with a particular history and concerns, would be applied\nto foreign numerical strings and in alien contexts. The rules and regulations of\none situation would be expanded to reach contexts never anticipated or intended.\nWell founded restrictions on one type of number could be irrational in another\ncontext. An individual with one type of number could control the use of that\nnumerical string in other contexts, extracting fees or concessions for its use. This\ncould create a dangerous precedent and have far reaching ramifications.\nDNS Issues\nThe core issues raised by ENUM are issues of administration the DNS database.\nThe core issue for a national government to resolve is whether to sanction a\nnational Tier 1 service provider and related administrative issues.76\nUnified Database\nThe first issue raised is whether ENUM requires a unified global database, also\nknown as a \"global tree.\" Proponents of a unified database argue that if there\nare multiple databases, an ENUM device would not know which to query.\nFurthermore, there is a risk of incompatible records in different databases.77\nEven if it is assume that a unified database is needed, one already exists.\nENUM is a DNS innovation and the DNS is a unified database. Any user\nanywhere in the world can query a DNS name server for www.cybertelecom.org\nand they will get the appropriate result. The DNS is both unified and global.\nThus, the question presented by ENUM is whether there needs to be a unified\ndatabase inside the unified database of DNS.\nPursuant to the ENUM protocol, data would be entered into the open DNS in a\nstandardized format. Since the data exists in a standard format across open,\ninterconnected, distributed databases, searches of that data are relatively easy.\nIf there were multiple ENUM databases, and if a user did not know which one to\nsearch, an opportunity would be created for metasearch engines to be created,\ncreating an ability to find the data in any known database. Alternatively, an\nENUM resolver could query known ENUM databases to determine if records\n\n76\n\nPfautz, ENUM Administrative Process, supra note 4, Sec. 1, at http://www.ietf.org/drafts/draftpfautz-yu-enum-adm-01.txt\n77\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 4.1, at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 17\n\n\fexist.78 NetNumbers indicates that it already has such a publicly available\nresolver.79\nAs consumers could access the information in the open DNS at multiple ENUM\nservice providers as easily as a single provider, there is nothing that would drive\nthe consumers to use only a single provider. Network effect is a factor for ENUM\nas a whole (for ENUM to work there has to be overall network effect), but not for\nindividual competitors. In other words, if ACME ENUM has only a few thousand\nrecords, but is reachable through metasearch engines, a resolver, or the use of\nextensions, then ACME could have as competitive a place in the market as large\nservice providers.\nIn addition, if the issue with multiple databases is knowing which database to\nsearch, the answer would seem obvious: tell the ENUM device which database\nto search. One possible way in which this could be achieved is by adding\nextensions to numbers. 5551212#36 could mean NetNumbers where\n5551212#46 could mean NeuStar. Since the device now knows which database\nto look in, this is no longer an issue.80\nFurthermore, ENUM databases, due to network effect, have an incentive to\ncooperate. ENUM has more value if it has more data; a means of getting more\ndata is to cooperate with other ventures and create open data platforms.81\nWhile it is not clear that a Golden Tree approach is necessary82, such an\napproach could have advantages. A centralized database could arguably\nfacilitate data verification, authentication, and integrity. Through a central\ndatabase, only data that met specifications would be entered. Unverified data\nwould be rejected and only one record for a given number would be created.\nCompetitive service providers would be interconnected through the unified\ndatabase.\n78\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 4.1 (noting alternatives to golden tree approach), at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm.\n79\n\nDouglas Ranalli, Is E164.arpa The Only Answer for Tier-1 ENUM Registry Services? (n.d.)\n(also noting that \"there is no evidence of the market deployment of hundreds or thousands of\nENUM services,\" meaning that querying those ENUM services that exist would be manageable),\nat http://www.netnumber.com/news/e164arpaComp.pdf.\n80\n\nENUM also seeks to solve the problem of telephone restrained by merely having numeric\nkeypads with which to enter addresses. New wireless phones have touch screens that can be\nconfigured in any way for any type of data input, increasing the opportunity for address design\nand ability to designate the appropriate database. See Kyocera - Kyocera SmartPhone Series\n(n.d.) (showing wireless phone with touch screen in place of keypad), at http://www.kyocerawireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm.\n81\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 4.1 (noting possible interconnection alternative to\ngolden tree approach), at http://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm.\n82\n\nSee also Ad Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 8.1 (Minority View of Report, indicating\nalternative to golden tree implementation), at http://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 18\n\n\fAdditionally, a joint partnership could have the advantage of branding and joint\nmarketing. A joint effort can be marketed to the public as the service endorsed\nwidely by industry participants. 83\nA disadvantage of a global unified database is the tremendous amount of global\ncoordination required in order to succeed. There could be 150+ Tier-1 service\nproviders that need to be established and coordinated. The effort involved in\norder to achieve coordination may result in delay in ENUM implementation and\nadministration.84 An additional disadvantage is possible restraints on creativity\nand innovation. As ENUM is administered is highly centralized through a global\nsystem, innovations could only be achieved through that centralized structure.\nThis reduces the ability of a competitive process to create new solutions that\nusers might desire.85\nWhether the Golden Tree approach is adopted may not immediately rise to a\npublic policy concern if further questions are not reached. In other words, if a\nGolden Tree does not require government sanction, then numerous concerns are\nalleviated. However, if industry continues to press for a government sanctioned\nTier 1 provider, it must be recognized that the election of the Golden Tree\napproach is one of preference and not necessity. In other words, selecting a\nunified approach which requires regulatory intervention and the creation of a\ngovernment sanction monopoly is a path of choice and it could be avoided.\nE164.arpa?\nIf it is concluded that there should be a unified database, where should that\ndatabase be located?86 RFC 2916 indicates that IANA should delegate the\ndomain name e164.arpa pursuant to the recommendation of Internet Architecture\nBoard (IAB).87 Pursuant to IAB recommendation, e164.arpa is to be technically\nadministered by RIPE NCC.88 The IETF selected e164.arpa as the location of\n83\n\nA concern has been raised that if multiple ENUM service providers form a joint partnership to\nimplement ENUM, there could be antitrust concerns.

The IETF ENUM model calls for ITU\ninvolvement at Tier 0 and national governments setting up Tier 1 providers.\nEven if it is assumed that Tier 0 and Tier 1 providers are necessary, government\nsanctioning of these providers would be inappropriate.\nThe possible benefits of creating a government sanctioned monopoly must be\nweighted against the costs. Such monopolies impact competition in their market;\nnormally they eliminated competition in their market. This, in turn, has an impact\non innovation and responding to consumer needs. The monopoly service\nbecomes encumbered with government entanglement, dramatically reducing the\nspeed of deployment and innovation. Centralized decision making in compliance\nwith federal administrative law is slow and less responsive to needs. In addition,\nthere is the cost of the bureaucracy and the lawyers and lobbyists employed to\ninteract with that bureaucracy.101\nParticularly problematic is the potential delay resulting from government\ninvolvement.102 In order to implement a U.S. government sanctioned ENUM\nservice, there must be (1) legislative authority, (2) regulation, and (3) a\ngovernment procurement process. This could result is multiple years of delay in\nwhich alternatives could make the government sanctioned ENUM implementation\nobsolete. In addition, further evolution in ENUM policy would likewise be\nencumbered by government process.\nAt the international level, NetNumbers points out that \"it is simply time consuming\nand difficult to coordinate the selection of Tier-1 ENUM service providers access\n200+ ITU Member States.\"103 The resources dedicated to \"achieving consistent\npolicies regarding registration procedures, conflict resolution, disclosure of\nregistrant information, etc.\"104 may significantly impede progress of ENUM in the\nInternational arena.\nThe issue of the delay caused by the need for government involvement may be\none of the most insurmountable problems for ENUM.\n\n101\n\nSee Douglas Ranalli, Is \"E164.arpa\" The Only Answer for Tier-1 ENUM Registry Services?\n(n.d.)

Although it is a\nstable standard, it is subject to change based on further experience. An RFC\nbecomes a final \"Internet Standard\" when it has a significant implementation, is\noperationally successful, and has a \"high degree of technical maturity.\"106\nENUM, as of yet, has not demonstrated that it is a mature technology.\nGovernment sanctioning of a standard that is not final would be unusual.\nCommercial Viability\nWhether ENUM is likely to be commercial viable is less then certain. There are\nno known consumer studies concerning whether ENUM is a service that\nconsumers desire. There has been limited trial market deployments.107 Even if\nENUM were to be viable, there has been no study on what the market\npenetration might be (would it be widely deployed or useful only to a limited niche\nmarket) or whether the viability might be short lived.\nConversely, there are several indicators that suggest that ENUM may have\ndifficulty being commercially viable. The primary concern is privacy; people may\nnot want all of their contact information aggregated in a single open space.\nSimilarly, ENUM is mono dimensional; an ENUM number goes in and all of the\ncontact information comes out, without flexibility or further alternatives.\nAlternatives, such as the proposed Microsoft Hailstorm offers greater consumer\nempowerment, offering greater control over what information will be released to\ndifferent queries of the system. Based on privacy concerns, alternatives could be\nmore compelling then ENUM's rigid option.\nThe second factor is network effect; ENUM will not be valuable unless a large\nnumber of individuals register ENUM numbers. But until there is a large number\nof registrations, there were be a low incentive to register with ENUM (a catch-22).\nLikewise, the numerous competitors to ENUM challenge its possibility for\nsuccess. Even if ENUM enjoys a degree of success, it is unclear whether it will\ncontinue to enjoy such success. Telephones are becoming increasingly\nintelligent; ENUM's restraints, such as the limitation to the numeric keypad, may\nmake it antiquated.108 There is a possibility that ENUM seeks to solve\nyesterday's problem.\n105\n\nSee RFC 2026, supra note 1, (explaining IETF process and difference between proposed,\ndraft, and Internet standards), at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt.\n106\n\nId., Sec. 4.1.3.\n\n107\n\nSee Tony Rutkowski, ENUM Policy Briefing to US Dept of State, FCC, and NTIA, slide 9 (n.d.)\nat http://www.enumworld.com/resources/NTIA_policy_brief.ppt. NetNumbers is a live market\ndeployment but not data has been presented from NetNumbers indicating success of the\ndeployment.\n108\n\nSee footnote 80 (noting that modern phones offer greater flexibility for address input and need\nnot be limited to numeric strings).\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 23\n\n\fFurther difficulty could be experienced internationally, where several countries\nhave expressed concern over IP telephony bypass of the public telephone\nnetwork and sought to bar such bypass. As ENUM could be perceived as\nfacilitating bypass, it could be expected that several countries might bar ENUM,\nlimiting its network effect and thus commercial viability.\nThe commercial viability of ENUM is not established and may even be doubtful. It\nwould therefore be imprudent for a government to sanction a monopoly for a\nservice where its viability is in question.\nDirectory Assistance Competition\nENUM is a directory assistance service. It provides a solution to the problem of\nhow to find a means of communicating with an individual. As noted above, the\ndirectory assistance market is highly competitive. ENUM faces competition from\nsuch powerful market players as Microsoft, AOL, VeriSign, and Palm Pilot.109 A\ngolden tree approach to ENUM would likely have to compete with private\nimplementations of ENUM110 (NetNumbers has been commercially launched\nsince November of 2000 and has acquired 14 partners without any need of\ngovernment sanctioning111). ENUM also faces competition from SIP, Instant\nMessaging, and TRIP. This competitive market gives users the ability to sort out\nwhich services are the most useful and compelling. Endorsement by the\ngovernment of one competitor over all others would distort the market, be\ninappropriate, and determine market winners through regulation instead of\ncompetition.\nITU Involvement\nIETF presentations have indicated that all countries must address the same\nissues for ENUM.112 There is no further explanation of why this is so. Given the\nwide diversity of regulatory and market environments, it would seem that any\nrequirement that national tier 1 providers address ENUM issues in exactly the\nsame way would be unnecessary, inaccurate, and cause significant delay while\ncoordination is resolved.\n\n109\n\nSee, supra p. 10 (listing competitive alternatives to ENUM).\n\n110\n\nTwo documents so far have suggested that alternative implementations of ENUM should be\nrestricted or prohibited. See France Conditions, supra note 90, at\nhttp://www.ngi.org/enum/pub/15_ww9.htm; Stralmark, supra note 100, at\nhttp://www.enum.org/information/files/enum_summary.pdf.\n111\n\nSee footnote 50, and accompanying text.\n\n112\n\nSee Steve Lind, AT&T, Tony Holmes, BT, ENUM Administration Issues, slide 5 (Jan. 17,\n2001) (hereinafter Lind, ENUM Administrative Issues); Chairman's Report of the ITU ENUM\nWorkshop, ITU, Geneva (Jan. 17, 2001), Annex 7: ENUM Issues: Issue 3, at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/workshopjan01/report-jan17-2001.htm\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 24\n\n\fThe IETF is cooperating with the ITU partly because the ITU is the authority for\nthe E.164 numbering system. Originally, as stated in the ENUM RFC, the role of\nthe ITU was limited:\nNames within this zone are to be delegated to parties according to the ITU\nrecommendation E.164. The names allocated should be hierarchic in accordance with\nITU Recommendation E.164, and the codes should assigned in accordance with that\nRecommendation.113\n\nThe role was limited to the fact that country codes in e164.arpa are to comport\nwith the ITU E.164 Recommendation. The ITU had no authority pursuant to this\ntext; it was not asked to do anything.\nIn October 2000, the ITU released the Liaison to IETF/ISOC on ENUM.114 This\nLiaison requires national governments to designate to the ITU their Tier 1 service\nprovider. Thus the ITU would act as an international ENUM gate keeper and\ncredential recognizer. The Liaison also appears to attempts to obligate any\nENUM effort, whether part of the golden tree or not, to comply with ITU\ndirection.115\nIn June of 2001, Robert Shaw recommended an even further role for the ITU,\nsuggesting that the ITU should be responsible for outsourcing the responsibilities\nof administering the Tier 0 service provider and \"define and implement\nadministrative procedures that coordinate delegations of E.164 numbering\nresources into these name servers.\"116\n113\n\nRFC 2916, supra note 2, para 4, at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2916.txt\n\n114\n\nLiaison, supra note 19, at http://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/wp1-39_rev1.htm. This was\nsubsequently released as an informational RFC. RFC 3026, supra note 19, at ftp://ftp.rfceditor.org/in-notes/rfc3026.txt. \"An 'Informational' specification is published for the general\ninformation of the Internet community, and does not represent an Internet community consensus\nor recommendation.\" RFC 2026, supra note 1, para 4.2.2, at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt.\n115\n\nAccording to the Liaison, \"All administrative entities, including DNS administrators, will adhere\nto all the applicable tenets of all pertinent ITU Recommendations, e.g., E.164, E.164.1, E.190,\nand E.195, with regard to the inclusion of the E.164 resource information in the DNS.\" Liaison,\nsupra note 19, at http://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/wp1-39_rev1.htm. The ITU's role is further\ndescribed as follows: \"For all E.164 Country Code Zone resources (Country Codes and\nIdentification Codes), the ITU has the responsibility to provide assignment information to DNS\nadministrators, for performing the administrative function. The ITU will ensure that each Member\nState has authorized the inclusion of their Country Code information for input to the DNS. For\nresources that are spare or designated as test codes there will normally be no entry in the DNS.\nHowever, the ITU will provide spare code lists to DNS administrators for purposes of clarification.\nThe entity to which E.164 test codes have been assigned will be responsible for providing any\nappropriate assignment information to DNS administrators.\" Id. And again, \"The ITU may\nrequest the consultation of the WP1/2 experts as necessary and as prescribed in Resolution 20.\"\nId. See also Shockey, SGA, supra note 10, slide 18 (stating \"ITU will insure that Member States\nhave authorized inclusion of their Country Code in e164.arpa\" and \"ITU to coordinate with RIPE\nNCC as the Root Administrator.\"), at http://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/workshopusafeb1213/shockey.htm.\n116\n\nShaw, DTI ENUM Workshop, supra note 11, slide 16 at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/dtijune501/dti-june-5-2001-1.PPT; Shaw, ICANN, supra note 11,\nslide 14, at http://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/GACjune1201/gac-june-2-2001-1.PPT.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 25\n\n\fOne explanation for ITU involvement is the concern on the part of the IETF and\nRIPE that it does not want to be put into the position of determining who is the\nappropriate authority for an e164 code. If the ITU recognizes the credentials of\nan entity as the proper authority for that code, that relieves the IETF and RIPE of\nthe risk of getting involved in skirmishes over who the proper authorities are.\nThe ITU Liaison design does not appear necessary. As articulated in RFC 2916,\nENUM requires receiving the data of what E.164 country codes map to what\ncountries. Other than this public available information that does not require ITU\naction or authority, there appears to be no need for ITU authority or involvement.\nMuch of the ITU's involvement is based on the premise that ENUM are telephone\nnumbers, and the ITU is the authority over the E.164 standard. As demonstrated\nabove, ENUM numbers are not telephone numbers.\nThe benefit of the RIPE NCC acquiring a gatekeeper must be weighed against\nthe costs. There are other means by which this can be achieved. RIPE NCC\ncould set forth the criteria for the representatives it will recognize. For example,\nRIPE NCC could indicate that the head of a nation's ITU delegation must specify\nthe Tier 1 ENUM provider to RIPE NCC. The nation would interact directly with\nRIPE NCC without the ITU intermediary.\nThe relationship between the IETF and ITU is one of mutual recognition. The\nITU Liaison recognizes the IETF effort and the IETF in turn recognizes ITU\nauthority. By such recognition, the IETF ENUM effort is set apart from other\nprivate ENUM projects. Indeed, the ITU has opposed ENUM efforts that do not\nrecognize the need for the ITU.117 Mutual recognition is an insufficient justification\nfor ITU authority and has a negative impact on competition.\nJoint Venture\nIf governments do not sanction ENUM service providers, the ENUM industry\nitself could cooperate and set up a unified tree ENUM project without the\ngovernment. This could, for example, be a joint venture.118 However, one\nconcern with such cooperation would be anti trust concerns. NeuStar has\n\n117\n\nThe ITU sent a letter to ICANN opposing Pulver's application to create a new TLD .tel.

During the summer of 2001 AT&T and WorldCom\nhad competing proposals concerning how industry could cooperatively and without government\ninvolvement, launch ENUM domestically. Steven D. Lind, AT&T, U.S. ENUM Frame Document\nImplementation Framework (n.d.) (distributed at June 18, 2001 State Department ENUM Ad Hoc\nMeeting); Peter Guggina, WorldCom Contribution for Independent ENUM Forum (Jun. 12, 2001).\nSee also Ad Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 8.1 (discussing industry forum), at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 26\n\n\fcursorily concluded that there is no anti trust concern.119 An antitrust analysis is\nbeyond the scope of this paper. However, it is worth noting that the issue exists.\nConclusion\nThe question of whether ENUM should have government sanctioned monopoly\nproviders is in the historical context of the deregulatory environment of the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, the efforts to privatize the DNS through the\nwork of ICANN, and the US's policy position that Internet issues are outside the\njurisdiction of ICANN. The ENUM question runs directly into US policy in the\narea of IP Telephony and ICAIS120 where the US has defending the notion\ncountries will experience the greatest benefit from high tech innovation if they\nleave these markets unregulated. In an age where the government in embarked\nin a tireless battle to tear down monopoly positions in the market, ENUM asks\nthat it be blessed with monopoly status.\nHistorically, the government sets up two types of monopolies: production\nmonopolies or standards monopolies. Production monopolies are typified by\nAT&T in the 1930s where, in the opinion of the government, there was an\nefficiency in only have one company produce the service.121 Standards require\ngovernment sanction where there is something about the standard that compels\nsanctioning. The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is a standard that\nrequires unique assignment of telephone numbers. There can be only one.\nENUM fits within neither of these situations. The directory assistance market is\ncompetitive. The barrier to entry is low and is the risk monopolization.\nConversely, sanctioning one competitor over others could thwart innovation and\nservice to the consumer. Likewise, ENUM is not a standard that requires\ngovernment sanction.\nThe ENUM industry has already made contingency plans, in the event that the\nUS government fails to act, to implement ENUM domestically through an ENUM\nforum. They have conceded that government sanctioning is not necessary to\nmake this succeed. The cost of having the government involved will like be\nmultiple years of delay, giving alternatives first mover advantage and making that\ndelay fatal to ENUM. Not only is government sanctioning of ENUM\n\n119\n\nContribution of NeuStar, US Study Group A Ad-Hoc, supra note 4, p. 2 (stating in one\nsentence and without supporting analysis that there is no antitrust concern).\n\n120\n\nInternational Internet Carriage and Settlement or ICAIS. This is a controversy over Internet\nbackbone peering, where other countries seek to impose telecommunications settlements on\nInternet peering and the US has opposed such policy in favor of unregulated private contractual\nnegotiations in a competitive market.

But the authority of the\nIAB and RIPE NCC is not clear. At the national levels, the Tier 1 service provider\nwould have authority derived from the nation government. RIPE NCC and the\nIAB, however, have no international or national authority. This raises questions\nsuch as\n\u2022 From where is their authority derived?\n\u2022 To whom are they accountable?\n\u2022 How will their ENUM work be funded?\n\u2022 How would disputes be resolved?\n\u2022 How would they behave in the event of war or national disaster?\n\u2022 How would they be protected from litigation or local process (i.e., search\nwarrants or wiretaps)?\n\u2022 How would they be open and transparent?\n\u2022 How would they be responsive to member states?\n\u2022 How would they resolve new policy questions? Who would have the authority\nto resolve those questions?\n\u2022 How will reliability be assured?123\nUnless the authority for the Tier 0 provider is properly established, it could make\nENUM vulnerable to continuous challenges and problems. It may be appropriate\nto consider whether the documentation behind .arpa and the delegation of\nE164.arpa to IAB and RIPE NCC is sufficient to be legally stable. If ENUM\nbecomes essential to communications, it would be in the public interest to ensure\nits full stability and reliability.\nDNS Conflict Resolution\nHow will potential conflicts between ENUM numbers be resolved? In the DNS,\nICANN regulates by contract, requiring domain name registrants to agree to be\n122\n\nThis paper does not analyze ICANN's involvement in ENUM. However, it is noteworthy that\nICANN has attempted to exercise jurisdiction over ENUM. ICANN, in a recent contract with\nVeriSign, attempted to exercise control over VeriSign's ENUM activities.

NeuStar has\nsuggested that one appropriate solution for ENUM is compliance with ICANN's\nUniform Dispute Resolution Process.124 As ENUM numbers are domain names,\nit is possible that this would be required. A NetNumber's IETF Internet Draft\nsuggests that ENUM number assignees should be bound by terms and\nconditions of Tier 1 service providers, including dispute resolution.125 Like\nICANN, this would be top down regulation through contract.\nHijacking, Cybersquatting, and Data Authentication\nThere are several identified naming and fraud problems. These include hijacking,\ncybersquatting, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks.126\nHijacking or redirection of communication: ENUM numbers query the DNS\ndatabase for contact information. If access to the NAPTR records is\ncompromised, a third party could alter the contact information. This could result\nin redirection of traffic away from the desired end point.127 An example of this\nwould be an ENUM number for a popular call center for the ACME company.\nThe BETA company fraudulently causes the ENUM record to be revised,\nchanging the SIP addresses from ACME to BETA. Now communications go to\nthe BETA call center and BETA attempts to steal ACME's customers.\nEavesdropping: Similar to redirection of traffic, eavesdropping permits the traffic\nto go through to the desired end point, but only after going through a third\nparty.128 In this way, the third party can monitor all communications using the\nENUM number. For example, communications from CHARLIE to ACME would\ngo through BETA first.\nDenial of service: If a company becomes dependent upon traffic directed to it\nthrough its ENUM number, and if the security of the ENUM record is\ncompromised, a third party could alter the ENUM record data and effectively\nblock all traffic to the company. This could essentially result in a denial of service\nattack.\n\n124\n\nContribution of NeuStar, Inc., US Study Group A Ad-Hoc, supra note 4, p. 14.\n\n125\n\nRanalli, Tier-1 ENUM, surpa note 33, Secs. 4.4, 6.2, at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draftranalli-peek-walter-enum-t1roles-01.txt\n\n126\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 7.1, at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm; Ranalli, Tier-1 ENUM, supra note 33, Sec.\n7, at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ranalli-peek-walter-enum-t1roles-01.txt.\n127\n\nSee Brown, ENUM Service Reference Model, supra note 4, Sec. 8, at\nhttp://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-enum-operation-02.txt.

For example, if someone hijacked ENUM records, the individual\ncould be in violation of The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act.129\nIn order to respond to these concerns, ENUM services will need to authenticate\nusers and the data submitted. The IETF ENUM convention, again, is that the\nassignee of a telephone number should be the assignee of an ENUM number.\nThis means that a user's telephone information would need to be authenticated.\nThis could be achieved in a number of ways.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nDirectory assistance information for telephone numbers. 130\nOpen Network Architecture, under Computer III, where the Bell Operating\nCompanies are arguably under an obligation to provide this information to\nenhanced service providers.131\nLine Information Database (LIDB).132\nAutomatic Number Identification where the signaling in the network itself will\nconfirm the callers identity.133\nThe phone number itself can be called.\nThe registrant could be required to show a phone bill.134\nIndependent authentication or verification through commercial verification\nservices.135\n\n129\n\nFTC, ID Theft: When Bad Things Happen to Your Good Name (August 2000).

In other words, there is no indication that new\nregulations facilitating assignment are necessary.\nTelephone Number Issues\nENUM is a DNS innovation. ENUM numbers are not telephone numbers even\nthough they have the same numerical string as telephone numbers. ENUM\npresents no telephone number administration issue and will not change the\nnumbering plan.136\nNumbering Assignment\nENUM does not affect telephone number assignment. Assignment of public\ntelephone numbers is conducted through the appropriate public telephone\nauthorities. Nothing about ENUM changes this. For all practical purposes, the\npublic telephone network authority does not even have to know that ENUM\nexists.\nTelephone numbers are assigned to telephone network devices so that people\ncan reach them on the telephone network. Assignment of a telephone number\nfor use off of the telephone network makes no sense. If the numerical string is\nnot used on the telephone network, then it is no longer a telephone number. One\ncould no more meaningfully assign a telephone number solely for ENUM\npurposes than one could assign a telephone number to identify an elephant.\nBy convention, ENUM numbers are to be assigned according to correlating\ntelephone number assignment. Only assigned telephone numbers would be\neligible for ENUM registration. Unassigned telephone numbers would not be\nassigned.137 However, if ENUM numbers were assigned that correlate to\nunassigned telephone numbers, nothing about the assignment would bind the\nNANP. The assignment of the ENUM number 5551212 to ACME does not give\nACME rights to that numerical sting in other contexts; it does not give ACME\nrights to 5551212 as a telephone number. If the telephone authority assigned\n5551212 to BETA, ACME would have no legal rights to challenge this\n136\n\nSee NeuStar FAQ, supra note 4, p. 1 (\"ENUM does not change the Numbering Plan and does\nnot change telephony numbering or its administration in any way. ENUM will not drain already\nscarce numbering resources because it uses existing numbers.\") at\nhttp://www.enum.org/information/files/enum_faq.pdf; Id., p. 4 (\"ENUM will not change the existing\nright-to-use rules and principles for telephone numbers. ENUM is not intended to change how\ntelephone numbers are administered, but instead facilitate a wide range of applications using\nphone numbers as subscriber names. ENUM also will not interfere with existing PSTN functions\nand technology, such as circuit switching, SS7 (ISUP or TCAP), or Intelligent Networking, where\nsimilar resource discovery activities are performed through the PSTN legacy technologies.\");\nShockey, SGA, supra note 4, slide 15 (stating \"ENUM does not change the Numbering Plan\"), at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/workshopusafeb12-13/shockey.htm.\n137\n\nContribution of NeuStar, Inc., US Study Group A Ad-Hoc, supra note 4, p. 13.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 31\n\n\fassignment. This is, in effect, the flip side of the argument that ENUM numbers\nare not telephone numbers. Not only do telephone number regulations not apply\nto ENUM, but ENUM number assignments do not apply to and do not bind\ntelephone number assignment.\nAs noted, ENUM numbers and telephone numbers are operationally distinct. If\nan ENUM number is assigned that correlates to an unassigned telephone\nnumber, the ENUM number will still work. The ENUM records would have\nwhatever contact information belongs to the registrant. The fact that the\nregistrant does not have the correlating telephone number does not affect this.\nFurthermore, as the ENUM query is done entirely over the Internet and not in the\ntelephone signaling network, it would not affect the telephone network.\nSlamming and Cramming\nFraudulent alternations of ENUM records are a concern. However, slamming\nand cramming, as defined by the FCC, are not. Slamming is the changing of a\nuser's service provider without authorization (i.e., change of long distance\nservice). Cramming is the adding of services without authorization. Neither\ninvolves altering the telephone number (the address information) of the user. A\nperson can be slammed (change long distance from AT&T to MCI) and crammed\n(adding service of call waiting) and no information in ENUM will be changed.\nConversely, all of the information in ENUM can be changed without slamming or\ncramming. ENUM records contain addresses and not information about the\nservices provided for those addresses. The related issues are hijacking,\ncybersquatting, and DOS attacks, discussed above.138\nNumber Portability\nThe IETF has stated that ENUM does not create number portability nor does it\ncreate a number portability problem.139 The assignment of an ENUM number is\nbased on assignment of a telephone number. ENUM therefore needs to\nauthenticate the assignee of a telephone number. Some ENUM supporters\nassume that authentication will be done by the LEC that serves the telephone\ncustomer.140 If the customer ports the number to another LEC, the source for\nauthentication changes. When a number is ported from Carrier A to Carrier B,\n138\n\nSee discussion on page 29.\n\n139\n\nRichard Shockey, IETF ENUM Working Group, FAQs About ENUM (Jul. 26, 2000), at\nhttp://www.ngi.org/enum/pub/DRAFT-SHOCKEY-enum-faq-01.TXT. The statement that ENUM\ndoes not affect numbering portability has been noticeably absent from subsequent presentations.\nSee Shockey, ITU-T, supra note 4, slide 13. NSI / VeriSign also does not view number portability\nas a crucial ENUM issue. See ENUMWorld FAQs (n.d.) at\nhttp://www.enumworld.com/faqs.html#9.

First, the AT&T scenario describes how number portability\naffects ENUM, not how ENUM affects number portability. The act of porting a\nnumber would change the information source for ENUM, but nothing about\ntelephone number portability has changed.\nIn addition, as noted above,142 there are multiple means of verifying number\ninformation. The assumption that the LEC serving the customer will be the\nENUM source of authentication is not necessarily true.\nThe ITU is studying the implications of ENUM for number portability; it is believed\nthat the ITU's work will not impact the IETF's ENUM work.143\nNon-E164 Numbers (i.e., 911, 711, 411)\nHow will ENUM handle non-E164 numbers, such as a 911 call? By design, non\nE.164 numbers would be handled by the device prior to calling the ENUM\nprotocol. If, for example, 911 is dialed, the CPE would set up the call without\ndipping into the ENUM database.144 A modern phone is a collection of multiple\nprotocols and programs; not every program is used with each use of the phone.\nIn the case of a 911 call, the ENUM protocol would never be used.\nNANP Number Shortage & New Area Codes\nENUM has no direct impact on the numbering resource;145 numbering resources\nare not assigned to ENUM service providers. However, there could be some\nanticipated indirect impacts.\n\n141\n\nP.

ENUM will not drain already\nscarce numbering resources because it uses existing numbers.\").\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 33\n\n\fAn indirect pressure could be if ENUM were successful. If ENUM is successful, if\nmany people want ENUM records, and if the one way to have an ENUM record is\nto have a telephone number, this could create a demand for telephone numbers.\nCurrently a house may have one number but 4 occupants. If each occupant\nwants an ENUM record, would this mean that the house would now want 4\nphone numbers? This could create a drain on the numbering resource.\nIn addition, ENUM records are frequently referred to as permanent. The\nassignment of telephone numbers is not. If an individual is known by that\nindividual's ENUM record, that individual may not want to give up the phone\nnumber associated with that record. Thus, if the individual sets up a record\nbased on a Virginia phone number, but then moves to California, there is an\nincentive to keep the subscription Virginia phone number and not recycle it into\nthe numbering pool. This too could create a new demand upon the resource.\nCarrier Selection\nENUM is not about carrier selection.146 The ENUM database would be populated\nwith address data of various types. Information about the carrier is not included\nand not relevant. In other words, if the ENUM record reflects that Joe should be\nreached long distance on a regular telephone at 703-555-1212, it makes no\ndifference in the context of ENUM whether that call is carried by AT&T, MCI or\nSprint.\nTelecom Bypass\nIETF presentations indicate that ENUM is not about telecom bypass.147 This is\nuncertain and indeed contradicted by other IETF presentations.148 Enabling\nENUM seems like an excellent way to provide the originating party options on\nhow to set up the communications; the originating party now has a selection of\nnetworks to select from and can now bypass networks the originating party does\nnot desire to use.\nFCC Jurisdiction\nAs argued above, ENUM numbers are not telephone numbers, they are domain\nnames. The ENUM service is provisioned through the DNS. The policy issues\nthat need to be resolved are issues of DNS administration. Thus, the FCC would\nnot have jurisdiction over ENUM on the grounds that involves telephone\nnumbers.149\n146\n\nShockey, ITU-T, supra note 4, slide 13; Shockey, SGA, supra note 10, slide 15, at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/workshopusafeb12-13/shockey.htm.\n\n147\n\nShockey, ITU-T, supra note 4, slide 13.\n\n148\n\nSee Lind, ENUM Administration Issues, supra note 112, slide 15 (enables \"network by-pass\").\n\n149\n\nSection 251(e) gives the FCC authority to \"create and designate one or more impartial entities\nto administer telecommunications numbering and to make such numbers available on an\nequitable basis.\" 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(e). Nothing about ENUM raises an issue related to the\nadministration of telecommunications numbering. Nor would it seem feasible to gain jurisdiction\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 34\n\n\fPrivacy\nENUM has the potential to aggregate a tremendous amount of contact\ninformation behind a single identifier. This is likely to raise significant\nconcerns.150 ENUM has been described as an opt-in system.151 However, there\nis nothing in the protocol that indicates that ENUM should be an opt-in. Nor is\nthere any known technical reason why it would be limited to an opt in system.\nMuch would depend upon individual business plans. Three business plans can\nbe imagined. ENUM may be implemented at the corporate level so that\neveryone on a corporate network will have access to contact information and an\nenhanced ability to contact other people on the network - employees would have\nno option on whether to participate. Second, ENUM may be implemented by a\nmajor network as individuals subscribe. One can imagine AOL creating ENUM\nrecords as individuals subscribe, utilizing ENUM as a means for members to\ncontact each other. This could be an opt-out scenario. Finally, owners of ENUM\nenabled wireless telephones could, on an individual basis, set up ENUM records.\nThis could be an opt-in situation.\nThere is no limit to the scope of personal information that could be included in the\nENUM database. It is conceivable that it could include such things as social\nsecurity numbers, drivers license numbers, or credit card numbers. No known\nanalysis has been conducted concerning how ENUM complies with the EC Policy\non Privacy and Data Protection.152 Nor has an analysis of privacy implications\nbeen provided by privacy public interest organizations or the US Federal Trade\nCommission.\nover ENUM under the ancillary jurisdiction doctrine. See Statement of Commissioner Michael\nPowell, Concurring, CC Docket No. 96-98 (n.d.) (\"We may eventually win an \"ancillary\njurisdiction\" argument in court against the building owners and landlords, but it does not seem like\ngood policy to propose a new regulatory dictate on these entities before other measures to\nevaluate the problem or pursue other non-regulatory initiatives prove inadequate.\"), at\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Powell/Statements/stmkp917.txt; Separate Statement of\nCommissioner Michael Powell, Implementation of Sec 255 (Jul. 14, 1999) (\"I am unconvinced that\nsuch an unrestrained application of ancillary jurisdiction has been sanctioned by the courts, nor\ndo I believe it to be consistent with our own precedents. Accordingly, while I support 99.99\npercent of this item and everything that it achieves, I must dissent from its assertion of ancillary\njurisdiction.\")\n150\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Sec. 7.2 (discussing privacy concerns), at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm\n151\n\nAd Hoc ENUM Report, supra note 2, Secs. 4.3 & 7.2, at\nhttp://www.cybertelecom.org/library/enumreport.htm; Faltstrom, ENUM Technical Issues, supra\nnote 9, slide 29; Shockey, ITU-T, supra note 4, slide 14, at\nhttp://www.itu.int/infocom/enum/workshopjan01/annex4-shockey.ppt; NeuStar FAQ, supra note 4,\np. 7 (stating \"ENUM would be a subscriber-controlled 'opt-in' system . . . \"), at\nhttp://www.enum.org/information/files/enum_faq.pdf.\n152\n\nNeuStar claims that ENUM is consistent with the EC Privacy Policy.

Then again, so do many\nother innovations such as Instant Messaging, SIP, PalmPilots, and the multiple\nother directory assistance services. The key policy consideration that ENUM\npresents is whether it should have government entanglement. The answer is no.\nNot only would it be contrary to pro-competitive policy, not only is there no\njustification for a government sanctioned monopoly, but government involvement\nwould likely be fatal to the ENUM effort itself, injecting delay and encumbering\nthe project with bureaucracy. The U.S. Government has long held the policy that\nit should stay out of the way of the innovation in the highly competitive\ninformation technology market; this policy should be maintained.\n\nRobert Cannon\n\nDraft - Page 36\n\n\f"}
