Among them are superconductivity and superfluidity\n(for a review see [1]), non-Fermi liquids [2,3], metamagnetism [4,5], the quantum Hall\neffect [6\u201313], and more. In this note we provide another example, namely that of a\nstriped phase of fermionic matter at non-zero density.\nSome of the aforementioned phenomena have been investigated in the bottom-up\napproach, in which one does not start with a well-defined boundary theory, but rather\nwith a toy model in the bulk which seems to capture the essence of the phenomena.\nHere we take the top-down point of view and study the D3-D7' model, a particular\n(2+1)-dimensional system consisting of a D7-brane intersecting a stack of D3-branes\nwith #ND = 6. We use the probe approximation, in which the D7-brane is treated\nas a probe in the near-horizon background of the D3-branes. The low-energy and\nweak-coupling spectrum has charged states that are purely fermionic. It therefore\nseems like a good place to start looking for interesting phenomena.\nThe D3-D7' system was originally proposed in [14] as a holographic model for\nstrongly interacting fermions in 2+1 dimensions. In [7, 11] this model was used to\nexplore the phases of the system at non-zero temperature and charge density in the\nbackground of a magnetic field. In [11, 12] it was shown that the system exhibits a\ngapped phase similar to a quantum Hall state at fixed ratios of the magnetic field to\nthe charge density.\nHere we analyze the system in the ungapped phase and without a magnetic field.\nThis system resembles a Fermi liquid in that the resistivity at low temperature scales\nas T 2 . However, the heat capacity at low temperature does not follow the Fermi\nliquid formula.\nWe analyze the four-dimensional bulk quasi-normal modes, which correspond to\nthe poles in the bi-fermion two-point functions of the three-dimensional boundary\ntheory, including the current-current correlators. In particular, we will demonstrate\nthat the system becomes unstable to the formation of a striped phase when the\nratio of the charge density to the squared temperature is above a critical value. This\ninstability can be effectively described by a U(1) gauge field interacting with an axion\nfield in a constant background electric field.\nStriped phases are known to exist in condensed matter systems. Examples include\ncharge density waves and spin density waves (for reviews see [15, 16]), but there\nare more complicated situations as well. What is common to them is that some\nobservable of the system is modulated in one direction and hence the name striped\nphase. Holographic striped phases in 3 + 1 dimensions were analyzed in [17\u201320].\nNote added: As this paper was being completed [21] appeared which finds a similar\ninstability in a different (2+1)-dimensional holographic model.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAn instability in Maxwell-axion theory\n\nIn [17] Nakamura, Ooguri, and Park demonstrated that five-dimensional MaxwellChern-Simons theory becomes unstable in the presence of a background electric field\ndue to a non-zero momentum mode that becomes tachyonic. As we will now show, a\nsimilar instability can occur in a four-dimensional Maxwell-axion theory, which has\nthe Lagrangian density\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b1\nL = \u2212 FIJ F IJ + (\u2202I \u03a6)2 \u2212 m2 \u03a62 + \u01ebIJKL \u03a6FIJ FKL .\n4\n2\n2\n2\nThe equations of motion are given by\n1\n(\u0003 + m2 )\u03a6 \u2212 \u03b1\u01ebIJKL FIJ FKL = 0\n2\nIJ\n\u2202I F \u2212 2\u03b1\u01ebIJKL\u2202I (\u03a6FKL ) = 0 .\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nExpanding around a background with F = F (0) and \u03a6 = 0, the linearized equations\nfor the fluctuations fIJ and \u03c6 are given by\n(0)\n\n(\u0003 + m2 )\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b1\u01ebIJKL FIJ fKL = 0\n\u2202I f\n\nIJ\n\nIJKL\n\n\u2212 2\u03b1\u01eb\n\n(0)\n\u2202I (\u03c6FKL )\n\n(4)\n\n= 0.\n\n(5)\n(0)\n\nConsider a constant background electric field in the z-direction F03 = E.

For a\nbackground magnetic field, on the other hand, there is no instability. We will find a\nsimilar instability in the four-dimensional bulk theory of the D3-D7' system. This will\nbe interpreted as an instability of the boundary theory at non-zero density towards\nthe formation of a striped phase.\n3\n\n\f3\n\nReview of the D3-D7' model\n\nA holographic model for fermions in 2+1 dimensions can be constructed using a D7brane and D3-branes that intersect in 2+1 dimensions. Since #ND = 6 in this\ncase, the massless spectrum of the D3-D7 open strings consists only of the desired\nfermions. The separation between the D7-brane and D3-branes in the transverse\ndirection corresponds to the fermion mass. We decouple the fermions from the closed\nstring modes by focusing on the near-horizon limit of a large stack of N3 D3-branes and\ntreating the D7-brane as a probe. According to the usual gauge/gravity duality, the\ndynamics of the probe D7-brane in the near-horizon D3-brane background captures\nthe physics of the (2+1)-dimensional fermions interacting with a strongly-coupled\n(3+1)-dimensional gauge theory.\n\n3.1\n\nBackground\n\nWe begin with the near-horizon background of the non-extremal D3-branes:\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0001\ndr\n\u22122\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u22122\n2\n2\nL ds10 = r \u2212h(r)dt + dx + dy + dz + r\n+ r d\u03a95\nh(r)\n\u0001\nF5 = 4L4 r 3 dt \u2227 dx \u2227 dy \u2227 dz \u2227 dr + d\u03a95 ,\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\n\u221a\nwhere h(r) = 1 \u2212 rT4 /r 4 and L2 = 4\u03c0gs N3 \u03b1\u2032 . For convenience, we work in dimensionless coordinates, e.g., r = rphys /L. This background is dual to N = 4 SYM theory\nat a temperature T = rT /(\u03c0L). We parameterize the five-sphere as an S 2 \u00d7S 2 fibered\nover an interval:\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nd\u03a925 = d\u03c8 2 + cos2 \u03c8(d\u03a92 )2 + sin2 \u03c8(d\u03a92 )2\n(i)\n\n(d\u03a92 )2 = d\u03b8i2 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c6i ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c0/2, 0 \u2264 \u03b8i \u2264 \u03c0, and 0 \u2264 \u03c6i < 2\u03c0. As \u03c8 varies, the sizes of the two\nS 2 's change. At \u03c8 = 0 one of the S 2 's shrinks to zero size, and at \u03c8 = \u03c0/2 the other\nS 2 shrinks. The S 2 \u00d7 S 2 at \u03c8 = \u03c0/4 is the \"equator\".\n\n3.2\n\nProbe\n\nThe D7-brane extends in t, x, y, r and wraps the two two-spheres. The D7 embedding\nis usually taken to be characterized by \u03c8(r) and z(r). However, excitations around\nthis embedding are tachyonic. To cure this we turn on fluxes through the two twospheres labeled by the parameters f1 and f2 . With the correct choice of f1 and f2 , one\ngets a stable embedding. We also consider a non-zero charge density, by including the\ntime component of the worldvolume gauge field a0 (r), and a background magnetic\n\n4\n\n\ffield b.

We will vary f1 and fix f2 to satisfy this condition.\n1\n\nFor the MN embedding that describes the gapped phase, one must also add a boundary term\nSboundary = 2N c(rmin )ba0 (rmin ).

The latter exist only for f1 = 0 or\nf2 = 0 and for a fixed charge density to magnetic field ratio (filling fraction).

Due to rotational invariance, we can restrict to\nfluctuations propagating only in the x-direction; we thus consider fluctuations of the\nform f (u)e\u2212i\u03c9t+ikx .

Although it is true that in some cases the equations of\nmotion decouple from one another, we do not separately discuss those special cases.\nThe method that we will describe here works for any number of coupled or decoupled\ndifferential equations.\n\n8\n\n\fFirst of all, we are interested in normalizable solutions with infalling boundary\nconditions for the different fields. By inspection, one finds that all the fields, except\nfor \u03b4\u00e2t ,4 will have the same infalling behavior as u \u2192 1:\n\u03c9\u0302\n\n\u03b4\u03c8, \u03b4\u1e91, \u03b4\u00eax , \u03b4\u00e2y \u223c (1 \u2212 u)\u2212i 4\n\u03b4\u00e2t \u223c (1 \u2212 u)\n\n1\u2212i \u03c9\u0302\n4\n\n(37)\n.\n\n(38)\n\u03c9\u0302\n\nWe separate out this leading singular behavior. For example, \u03b4\u03c8 = (1 \u2212 u)\u2212i 4 \u03b4\u03c8reg ,\nwhere \u03b4\u03c8reg is regular at the horizon.\nWe are interested in finding those solutions for which all the fluctuations have a\nnormalizable behavior near the AdS boundary. Generically choosing boundary conditions at the horizon and shooting towards u \u2192 0 would be hopeless. However, one can\nutilize the so-called determinant method [24,25], which was succesfully applied also in\n[12]. Here we have five field equations for five fields (\u03b4\u03c8reg , \u03b4\u1e91reg , \u03b4\u00eax,reg , \u03b4\u00e2y,reg , \u03b4\u00e2t,reg )\nto solve, but they are subject to a constraint. Imposing the constraint for this system\nis equivalent to imposing it on the boundary conditions at the horizon and satisfying\nall the other equations of motion. Thus, there are two alternative routes one can\nchoose for taking the constraint into account: 1) make use of the constraint to solve\nfor \u03b4\u00e2\u2032t in terms of all the other fields or 2) only impose the constraint on the horizon\nboundary conditions for the temporal gauge field. Both of the routes are equivalent,\nbut we found it numerically faster to follow the second path. Therefore, we will not\nlose any equations but make sure to take the constraint into account. According to\nthe determinant method, we choose a set of linearly independent boundary conditions\nat the horizon, say,\n{\u03b4\u03c8reg , \u03b4\u1e91reg , \u03b4\u00eax,reg , \u03b4\u00e2y,reg } = {(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, \u22121), (1, 1, \u22121, 1), (1, \u22121, 1, 1)} .\n(39)\nAs mentioned above, the boundary condition for \u03b4\u00e2t,reg at the horizon is set by the\nconstraint: By expanding the constraint as a power series around the horizon, at\nzeroth order, one finds a condition for \u03b4\u00e2t,reg (1) in terms of others (this condition is\nequivalent to the relationship one would find from the \u03b4\u00e2t equation of motion (32)).\nThe derivatives at the horizon are set by the equations of motion. For example,\n\u2032\n\u03b4\u03c8reg\n(1) is found by expanding the \u03b4\u03c8 equation of motion (30) around the horizon,\nand \u03b4\u00e2\u2032t,reg (1) is set by the boundary conditions and the derivatives of the other fields.\nFinally, for any given momentum we solve the set of differential equations four\ntimes, corresponding to the four different boundary conditions in (39). The interesting\n4\n\nNotice that the different fall-off guarantees that the temporal component of the gauge field\nvanishes at the horizon, as should be the case when the thermal circle pinches off.\n\n9\n\n\fobject to look at is the determinant\n\uf8eb\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nu\u2206+ \u03b4\u03c8reg\nu\u2206+ \u03b4\u03c8reg\nu\u2206+ \u03b4\u03c8reg\nu\u2206+ \u03b4\u03c8reg\n\uf8ec\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\n\u03b4\u1e91reg\n\u03b4\u1e91reg\n\u03b4\u1e91reg\n\uf8ec \u03b4\u1e91reg\ndet \uf8ec\n\u03b4\u00eaII\n\u03b4\u00eaIII\n\u03b4\u00eaIV\n\uf8ed \u03b4\u00eaIx,reg\nx,reg\nx,reg\nx,reg\nIII\nIV\n\u03b4\u00e2Iy,reg\n\u03b4\u00e2II\n\u03b4\u00e2\n\u03b4\u00e2\ny,reg\ny,reg\ny,reg\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(40)\nu\u21920\n\nat the AdS boundary. For a given k\u0302, one then begins to scan over the complex\nvalued energy \u03c9\u0302 until a zero of the determinant is found. Once this is the case, one\nconcludes that a normalizable solution has been found. There is a linear combination\nof the boundary conditions giving the desired normalizable solution, for which all\nfluctuations vanish at the AdS boundary.\nIn practice, we start with a limit of the parameters such that the equations decouple and consider separately the different fluctuations. The quasi-normal modes are\nidentified as the values of (\u03c9\u0302, k\u0302) where the contribution to the determinant changes\nsign. The accuracy of these positions is therefore determined by the resolution of the\nscan, which in our case is at least 10\u22123 . Away from this limit the determinant is\ncomplex in general, and we look for positions at which its absolute value is smaller\nthan some \"numerical zero\". The \"numerical zero\" is chosen so as to maintain the\nsame accuracy as in the decoupled limit.\n\n4.3\n\nHydrodynamical mode and zero sound\n\nGenerically, the equations for the fluctuations are all coupled. However, there are\n\u02c6 m\u0302, k\u0302, f1 ) where some of the equations decouple\ncertain limits of the parameters (d,\nfrom the rest. This enables us to associate, even in the range of parameters where\nthe equations are coupled, certain modes to particular fields at least by name. But\nthe reader should not get confused; when the system is in the range of parameters\nwhere the equations are coupled, this naming may be meaningless.\nLet us start with the case where m\u0302 = 0 and d\u02c6 = 0. For this particular case\n\u03c8 \u2032 = 0 and \u0101\u20320 = 0, so the equation for \u03b4\u00eax decouples from the rest. For \u03b4\u00eax we find\na hydrodynamical mode (i.e., \u03c9\u0302(k\u0302 \u2192 0) \u2192 0) associated with charge conservation,\nwhich is purely imaginary and behaves as\n\u03c9\u0302 = \u2212iD k\u0302 2 + . . . ,\n\nk\u0302 \u223c 0 ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere D is the diffusion constant. For low k\u0302, this is the important mode since it\nhas the lowest imaginary value, corresponding to the collective mode with the longest\nlifetime. However, as k\u0302 is increased this mode meets another mode which initially\nstarted at \u03c9\u0302(k\u0302 = 0) \u223c \u22122i. After the modes meet they become a pair of complex\nmodes with both real and imaginary parts; the real parts have the same magnitude\nbut opposite signs. We depict this in Fig. 1 (left panel).\n10\n\n\fD\n\n`\n\u03a9\n\n12\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n`\nk\n\n8\n6\n\n-1\n\n4\n2\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n`\nd\n\n14\n\nFigure 1: Left: Quasi-normal modes for \u03b4\u00eax at d\u02c6 = 0, m\u0302 = 0 and \u03c8\u221e = \u03c0/4.\nBlue (solid) lines are the imaginary parts and\np red (dashed) lines are the real parts.\n\u02c6 Notice the linear behavior for small\nRight: Diffusion constant as a function of d.\ntemperatures, d\u02c6 \u226b 1.\nWhen d\u02c6 6= 0, but still m\u0302 = 0, the longitudinal vector and the \u03b4\u1e91 scalar are\ncoupled but the quasi-normal mode structure (if \u03c9\u0302 is not too large) is quite similar to\nthe zero-density case. There is a purely imaginary hydrodynamical mode that meets\nat some finite k\u0302 another purely imaginary, but non-hydrodynamical, mode, and for\nlarger k\u0302 there are two complex modes. This transition from purely imaginary modes\nto complex modes can also be regarded as a transition from a hydrodynamical regime\nto a collisionless regime (see [25] for a similar phenomenon in a (3+1)-dimensional\nboundary theory). The values of both |\u03c9\u0302| and k\u0302 at the meeting point decrease with\n\u02c6 see the left panel of Fig. 2.\nincreasing d;\n`\n\u03a9\n`\n\u03a9\n0.0\n\n0.010\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n`\nk\n\n-0.2\n\n0.005\n0.000\n\n2\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n` -0.4\nk\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.010\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.015\n-1.0\n\nFigure 2: Left: Quasi-normal mode for the coupled (\u03b4\u00eax , \u03b4\u1e91) system at m\u0302 = 0, d\u02c6 = 104\nand \u03c8\u221e = \u03c0/4.

The imaginary part decreases as k\u0302 increases and then increases for very large\nk\u0302 towards zero. As d\u02c6 is increased, the minimum of Im \u03c9\u0302 shifts to larger k\u0302.\nIndeed, this mode has the properties of the holographic zero sound mode [23, 26].\nAs T \u2192 0 at fixed charge d (and therefore d\u02c6 \u2192 \u221e), the purely diffusive mode disappears completely and the complex pair of modes start at k\u0302 \u2192 0, with an approximate\n11\n\n\fdispersion relation\n\u03c9\u0302 = v k\u0302 \u2212 iak\u0302 2 + . . . .\n\n(42)\n\nA calculation of v, for all f1 , gives v \u223c \u221a12 in the large d\u02c6 limit, in agreement with [23].\nIn this model, in addition to the quantum attenuation at zero temperature, there\nis very large damping for low momentum at non-zero temperature, turning the zero\nsound mode to a purely dissipative mode.\nHowever, as we will see in the next subsection, these results can only be trusted\n\u02c6 beyond which there is an instability towards a striped\nup to some critical value of d,\nphase.\n\n4.4\n\nStripes\n\n\u02c6 an instability occurs. This instability\nIn this section we show that at large enough d,\noccurs only at some non-zero kphys , similar to what was found in [17] but now in a\n(2+1)-dimensional theory. This indicates that the Fermi liquid is unstable and that\nthe true ground state of the (2+1)-dimensional theory will be a striped phase, similar\nto a charge density and spin wave.\n`\n\u03a9\n\n`\n\u03a9\n2\n\n1\n\n0.2\n-1\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n`\nk\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n`\nk\n\n-2\n-1\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\nFigure 3: Lowest quasi-normal mode for \u03b4\u00e2y (left) and \u03b4\u03c8 (right), with d\u02c6 = 0, m\u0302 = 0\nand \u03c8\u221e = \u03c0/4.\nWe start with d\u02c6 = 0 and m\u0302 = 0. In this case the transverse gauge field fluctuation\n\u03b4\u00e2y and the embedding scalar fluctuation \u03b4\u03c8 decouple. The lowest quasi-normal\nmodes are portrayed in Fig. 3. At k\u0302 = 0 the lowest quasi-normal mode has the same\nvalue of \u03c9\u0302 as the second quasi-normal mode of the longitudinal vector (equations (34)\nand (35) are the same in this limit).\nFor d\u02c6 > 0 and m\u0302 = 0 the modes \u03b4\u00e2y and \u03b4 \u03c8\u0302 couple to one another. Above a critical\n\u02c6 the lowest negative imaginary quasi-normal mode crosses onto the upper\nvalue of d,\nhalf-plane, at some value of k\u0302, and becomes a positive imaginary frequency mode,\ni.e., an instability (Fig. 4, left panel). The critical value is d\u02c6c \u2243 5.5. There is a range\nin k\u0302 for which the frequency is positive imaginary, and at some larger k\u0302 it crosses\nagain back onto the lower part of the complex frequency plane. The dependence of\nthis range on d\u02c6 is shown in Fig. 4 (right panel). In this range the system is driven\n12\n\n\ftowards a striped phase, where both the transverse current and the fermion bi-linear\nare spatially modulated. The latter, in particular, describes a spin density wave. This\ncan be seen, for example, from the fact that at finite density a spatially modulated\nfield \u03c8 couples linearly to the magnetic field through the bulk CS term in (16).\n`\nk\n`\nd\n\n`\n\u03a9\n0.1\n0.0\n\n3.0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n`\nk\n\n7\n\n2.5\n\n-0.1\n2.0\n-0.2\n1.5\n-0.3\n1.0\n-0.4\n0.5\n-0.5\n0\n\n-0.6\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n`\nlog d\n\nFigure 4: Properties of the unstable mode with m\u0302 = 0 and \u03c8\u221e = \u03c0/4.

In this case all the fluctuations are coupled,\nand we still find an instability. As |m\u0302| increases, the critical value of d\u02c6 grows; see\nFig. 5. Since now \u03b4\u00e2t is also involved, one also obtains a charge density wave. As\nT \u2192 0 the instability appears for any small, non-zero charge\ndensity. The physical\n\u221a\n0.215 d\nmomentum at which this happens is given by kphys \u2243 L . Things are qualitatively\nsimilar when \u03c8\u221e 6= \u03c0/4. For instance when one decreases \u03c8\u221e from the value \u03c0/4\nthen d\u02c6c decreases slightly.\n\n13\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ungapped (BH embedding) phase of the D3-D7' system has an instability towards a striped phase above a critical value of the ratio of the charge density to the\ntemperature squared. For a non-zero mass the instability involves all the fields, and\ntherefore one expects that the new phase will be such that all the physical quantities\n(normalizable modes) associated with these fields are spatially modulated. These include charge, spin, and the transverse currents. In the dual bulk theory the instability\nis the result of an axion-like term in the action. On the other hand, the existence of\nthis term is intimately related to the fermionic nature of the boundary theory. We\nbelieve that striped phases are a general property of such theories. Since the model\nshould have a striped phase, one should be able to construct it as a solution of the\nequation of motion and study its properties.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Daniel Podolsky for useful comments and discussions.
