Indeed (comparing the pair SUSY Hamiltonians\nH\u00b1 with the Hamiltonians H1 and H2 ) we see that only when the hermiticity\ncondition of the W1 is readily satisfied, i.e., W\u20201 = W1 , we may put H1 in a\n\nA\u2212\n1 = \u2212I\n\n2\n\n\fbosonic sector Hamiltonian. In this case H1 (H2 ) becomes exactly H\u2212 (H+ )\nof a SUSY Hamiltonian model, analogous to the Witten model, viz.,\no\n1n 2\n1 d2\nW (x) + W\u2032 (x)\u03c33 =\nHSU SY = \u2212 I 2 +\n2 dx\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nH\u2212\n0\n\n0\n,\nH+\n\u0013\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c33 is the Pauli matrix. Only under the hermiticity condition one can\nto call W1 = W(x) of a matrix superpotential.\nLet H\u00b1 be the bosonic (-) and fermionic (+) sector Hamiltonians for a\ntwo-component eigenstate \u03a8\u2212 , given by\nd2\nH\u00b1 = \u2212I 2 + V\u00b1 (x),\ndx\n\n\u03a8\u2212 (x) =\n\n\u03c8\u2212,1 (x)\n\u03c8\u2212,2 (x)\n\n!\n\n(0)\n\nE\u2212 = 0,\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere I denotes the 2x2 unit matrix and the pair of SUSY potential V\u2212 (x),\nis a 2x2 matrix potential which may be written in terms of a 2x2 matrix\nsuperpotential W(x), viz.,\nV\u00b1 (x) = W2 (x) \u2213 W\u2032 (x).\n\n(6)\n\nLet us consider the eigenvalue equations for the bosonic and fermionic\nsector Hamiltonians, viz.,\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nH\u00b1 \u03a8\u00b1 = E\u00b1 \u03a8\u00b1 , n = 0, 1, 2, * * * .\n\n(7)\n\nThese systems can exhibit bound and continuous eigenstates under the annihilation conditions\n(0)\nA \u2212 \u03a8\u2212\n\n= 0,\n\n(0)\n\u03a8\u2212 (x)\n\n(0)\n\n=\n\n\u03c8\u2212,1 (x)\n(0)\n\u03c8\u2212,2 (x)\n\n=\n\n\u03c8+,1 (x)\n(0)\n\u03c8+,2 (x)\n\nor\n+\n\nA\n\n(0)\n\u03a8+\n\n= 0,\n\n(0)\n\u03a8+ (x)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n!\n\n(8)\n\n!\n\n(9)\n\n.\n(0)\n\nIn this case we see that one cannot put \u03a8+ (x) in terms of \u03a8\u2212 (x) and viceversa in a similar manner to the case of one-component eigenfunction system.\n(0)\nHowever, if \u03a8\u2212 (x) is normalizable we have\n3\n\n\fZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(0)\n\n\u0010\n\n(0)\n\n\u0011\n\n|\u03c8\u2212,1 |2 + |\u03c8\u2212,2 |2 dx = 1.\n\n(10)\n\nNote that in Eq.

[4] the author has taken a particular Hermitian matrix for his superpotential in such a way that the validity of his\ndevelopment is ensured.\nLet us now consider the interesting application of the above development\nfor a bidimensional physical system in coordinate space associated to a Neutron with magnetic momentum ~\u03bc = \u03bc(\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 ) in a static magnetic field\n[6].

We are considering the current I located\nalong the z-axis, and we have used units with h\u0304 = 1 = mass. The current\nI generate a static magnetic field. Also, note that V\u2212 (\u03c1) has zero ground\n(0)\nstate energy, E\u2212 = 0, thus SUSY is said to be unbroken.\nThe algebra of SUSY in quantum mechanics is characterized by one anticommutation and two commutation relations given below\n\nHSU SY = [Q\u2212 , Q+ ]+ ,\n\n[HSU SY , Q\u00b1 ]\u2212 = 0 = (Q\u2212 )2 = (Q+ )2 .\n\n(12)\n\nOne representation of the N = 2 SUSY superalgebra is the following\n\nHSU SY = [Q\u2212 , Q+ ]+ =\n\nA+ A\u2212\n0\n0\nA\u2212 A+\n\n!\n\n=\n4x4\n\nH\u2212 0\n0 H+\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nThe supercharges Q\u00b1 are!differential operators of! first order and can be\n0 0\n0 A+\n, where A\u00b1 are 2x2\ngiven by Q\u2212 =\n, Q+ =\n\u2212\n0 0\nA 0 4x4\n4x4\nnon-Hermitian matrices given by Eq.

This\nleads to 4x4 supercharges and supersymmetric Hamiltonians whose bosonic\nsectors are privileged with two-component eigenstates.\nWe have considered the application for a Neutron in interaction with a\nstatic magnetic field of a straight current carrying wire [6].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported in part by CNPq (Brazilian Research Agency).\nThe authors are also grateful to the organizing commitee of the Brazilian National Meeting on Theoretical and Computational Physics, April 6 to 9, 2003,\nBrasilia-DF, Brazil.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
