Rev. Lett.90, 226801 (2003), we\npresent a theory of drag in electronic double layers at low electron concentration. We show that\nthe drag effect in such systems is anomolously large, it has unusual temperature and magnetic field\ndependences accociated with the Pomeranchuk effect, and does not vanish at zero temperature.\n\nOver the last decade a large number of dramatic phenomena have been discovered in studies of the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in MOSFET [1, 2] and semiconductor heterojunction devices [3, 4, 5]. Collectively,\nthese phenomena are referred to under the euphonious title of the \"2D apparent metal insulator transition.\" They\nare associated with the behavior of the 2DEG in very\nclean (high mobility) devices with strong interactions,\ni.e. when the ratio of the p\ntypical interaction strength to\nthe Fermi energy, rs = 1/ na2B , is large, rs \u223c 10 \u2212 40.\n(Here n is the electron density per unit area and aB is the\neffective Bohr radius.) These observations make it clear\nthat the physics of this simple, but conceptually vital\nsystem is much richer than was previously appreciated.\nElsewhere, we have proposed [7, 8] that these phenomena are associated with a set of \"electronic microemulsion phases\" which occur as a consequence of Coulomb\nfrustrated phase separation[9] in the ideal (zero disorder)\n2DEG at densities intermediate between the high densities, where the system is a Fermi liquid, and low densities,\nwhere it is a Wigner crystal.\nIn the present paper we concentrate on the drag resistance of 2D large rs metals, with the goal of explaining\nthe unexpectedly large value of the drag resistance and\nthe unusual temperature and magnetic field dependances\nthat have recently been reported in bilayer p-type GaAs\nheterojunction devices [5, 6]. In a bilayer device, in the\npresence of a dissipative current IA in the first (active)\nlayer, the inter-layer electron-electron interactions induce\na momentum transfer between layers, which in turn produces a voltage, VP , across the second (passive) layer.\nIn the linear regime this effect can be characterized by a\ndrag resistance (per square)\nRD = VP /IA .\n\n(1)\n\nMeasurements of RD are a potentially useful probe of\ninteresting correlations of an electron fluid. It is exceedingly small at low temperatures in a Fermi liquid while,\nas we shall see, it is parametrically larger in a \"bubble\nfluid\" phase. It is therefore an ideal diagnostic for the\npresence of such phases.\n\n\u2217 spivak@dirac.phys.washington.edu\n\u2020 stevek@physics.ucla.edu\n\nThe existing theories of drag [10, 11] are mostly based\non the Fermi liquid theory of the electron liquid in individual layers. A common feature is that, at small temperatures, RD is small and vanishes as T \u2192 0 or as the\nspacing between layers, d \u2192 \u221e:\nRD \u223c (h/e2 )(kF d)\u2212\u03b1d (T /EF )\u03b1T .\n\n(2)\n\nFor a Fermi liquid, \u03b1T = 2 up to logarithmic corrections\nand \u03b1d = 2 \u2212 4 depending on the value of kF l, where l is\nthe elastic mean-free path and kF is the Fermi momentum.\nExperimental Background: The drag experiments\nthat motivated this study are performed on high mobility samples whose conductances are significantly larger\nthan e2 /h\u0304. Therefore, the putative electron localization\nlength one would infer on the basis of localization theory\nis exponentially long, and hence the associated 2D localization phenomena can be ignored for present purposes.\nIn double layer devices with relatively small rs ,\nmeasurements[12] of the drag are in qualitative agreement with Fermi liquid theory [10, 11]. However, at large\nrs , experiments on p-GaAs double layers [5, 6] differ significantly from the predictions of this theory :\n1. The drag resistance in these samples found to be\n2-3 orders of magnitude larger than expected on the basis\nof Fermi liquid theory.\n2. In the presence of a magnetic field, Hk , parallel to\nthe film, the temperature dependence of RD (T ) is significantly suppressed. (Here, Hk primarily couples to the\nspins of the electrons, rather than to their orbital motion. ) Whereas in a Fermi liquid, RD (T ) is a quadratic\nfunction of T , in large rs devices, at Hk = 0, the value\nof \u03b1T in Eq. 2 appears to be noticeably larger than 2;\nfor example, \u03b1T = 2.7 in [5, 6]. The value of \u03b1T (Hk )\nthen decreases with Hk and saturates for Hk > H \u2217 at a\nvalue which is significantly smaller than 2; for example,\nin Refs. [5] and [6], \u03b1T (Hk > H \u2217 ) \u223c 1.2. H \u2217 is generally believed to be the field required to fully polarize the\nelectron spins.\n3. As a function of increasing Hk , RD (Hk ) increases\nby a factor of 10-20 and saturates when Hk > H \u2217 (See\nFig.1 in [5] ). In the framework of the Fermi liquid theory,\none would expect a significant decrease of RD (Hk ) in the\nspin polarized state because EF is increased by a factor\nof 2 as Hk increases from 0 to Hk > H \u2217 , thus decreasing\nthe electron-electron scattering rate.\n\n\f2\n4. The T and especially the Hk dependences of\nRD (T, Hk ) and the resistances of the individual layers\nR(Hk , T ) look qualitatively similar to one another. (See\nFigs.1 a,b in [5] )\nIn fact, R(Hk , T ), itself, appears highly anomalous\nfrom the viewpoint of Fermi liquid theory. Thus, although our primary focus will be on RD , we will also\nsummarize the most salient anomalies in R(Hk , T ). Since\nsimilar phenomena have been observed in studies of the\n2DEG in MOSFETs and of the 2D hole gas (2DHG) in\nsemiconductor heterojunction devices, we report observations from both systems:\n5. An apparent continuous metal insulator transition\nas a function of n has been observed in Si MOSFET's\n[1] and to a lesser extend in GaAs heterojunctions [3,\n4, 5]. (No such transition is predicted on the basis of\nFermi liquid theory.) For the most part, in this paper we\nwill focus on the slightly higher density samples on the\nmetallic side of the apparent transition.\n6. The resistance of these samples increases significantly with increasing T : by as much as a factor\nof 6 in Si MOSFET's [1] and as much as 3 in GaAs\nheterojunctions[4, 5].\n7. The resistance of metallic samples at low T is significantly increased by non-zero Hk , and becomes nearly\nHk independent at high magnetic fields, Hk > H \u2217 [1].\nMoreover, non-zero Hk strongly suppresses the T dependence of R, so much so that R is nearly temperature\nindependent for Hk > H \u2217 . (To date, this latter effect\nhas been documented only in Si MOSFET's [2], where\ndR/dT at low temperature is decreased for Hk > H \u2217 by\nas much as a factor of 100 relative to Hk = 0.)\nTheoretical Background: The phase diagram of the\nbilayer 2DEG depends on many parameters. For simplicity, in this article we consider only the case when the\ndistance between the layers, d, is larger than the interelectron distance so that the discrete nature of the electrons is irrelevant in the calculation of the interaction\nenergy between electrons in different layers [20]. Moreover, we restrict ourselves to the case in which the \"passive\" layer has a large electron density, nP (i.e. small\nrs ), while the \"active\" layer has a low electron density,\nnA (i.e. rs \u223c rc , where rc is the critical value of rs for\nthe liquid-crystal transition \u2013 for a single band with an\nisotropic effective mass, rc is estimated[13] to be rc \u2248 38.)\nIn this limit, the passive layer acts as a ground-plane, so\nthe sequence of microemulsion phases in the active layer\nis the same as was derived previously[7, 8] for the 2DEG\nin a MOSFET.\nFor zero quenched disorder, the FL to WC transition\nis always expected to be first order [14]. In the absence\nof long-range interactions, this would lead to a regime\nof density exhibiting two-phase coexistence; due to the\nscreening by electrons in the passive layer, the electrons\nin the active layer interact via a dipolar interaction. It\nhas been shown in [7] that in this case, first order transitions are forbidden because the energy of a long interface\nbetween the two phases is negative. As a result, there\n\nexists between the WC (for nA < ncW C ) and the FL (for\nnA > ncF L ), an intermediate range (ncW C < nA < ncF L )\nof densities in which there is a set of new \"microemulsion\" phases which on the mean field level can be characterized as a mixture of microphase separated regions of\nliquid and crystal [7, 8]. The relative concentration, sizes,\nshapes, and organization of these regions is determined\nby thermodynamics. Even the full enumeration and classification of the distinct phases that result from Coulomb\nfrustrated phase separation is not complete, much less a\nthorough investigation of their properties.\nTo be concrete, we will focus on the drag effect in\nthe case when the active layer is in the bubble phase\nin which the majority phase is a FL, with a finite concentration of bubbles of WC. This phase can be viewed\nas a suspension of pieces of Wigner crystallites floating\nin an otherwise uniform Fermi fluid, like ice in a river.\n(Many of the same considerations apply to more general\nmicro-emulsion phases, as we will discuss in a forthcoming paper[17].) As a function of decreasing, nA , the areal\nfraction of Wigner crystal, fW C rises continuously from\nvanishingly small when nA = ncF L to fW C = 1 when\nnA = ncW C .\nThe WC bubble phase occurs when nA is close to ncF L\n(See Figs.1 and 2 in [7] and [8]). As nA \u2192 ncF L , the\nbubble size approaches a constant value LB = d exp[\u03b3],\nwhere \u03b3 is a (positive and order 1) dimensionless ratio of\nmicroscopic parameters which is proportional to the surface tension between the Wigner crystal and Fermi fluid\nphases. The spacing between bubbles [ncF L \u2212 nA ]\u22121/2\ndiverges as nA \u2192 ncF L . At mean-field level, these bubbles, themselves, form a crystal of bubbles, but for sufficiently dilute bubbles, either quantum and classical fluctuations inevitably melt the bubble crystal. Nevertheless\nthe charge inhomogeneities in the resulting bubble liquid\nare still very slowly fluctuating compared to the relaxation times of the Fermi liquid. The competition between\nthe local tendency to phase separation and the Coulomb\ninteraction (capacitive energy), results in a mean density\n\u221a\ndifference between the WC and FL regions \u2206n \u223c nA /d.\nThe qualitative temperature and magnetic field dependence of fW C is determined by the Pomeranchuk effect\n[7, 8]. Because the Wigner crystal has higher spin entropy density (SW C \u223c n log[2]) than the Fermi liquid\n(S \u223c n(T /EF )), fW C is an increasing function of temperature at low temperatures. This is a precise analogue\nof the Pomeranchuk effect in He3 . Similarly, since the\nspins are substantially more polarizable in the Wigner\ncrystal phase, fW C is an increasing function of Hk , but\nit saturates above a (temperature dependent) characteristic magnetic field strength, H \u2217 at which the spins are\nfully polarized. Moreover, the two effects compete, so\nthat when Hk \u226b T , the temperature dependence of fW C\nis quenched. (Here, and henceforth, we will adopt units\nin which h\u0304 = kB = the Bohr magneton = 1.)\nThe strong dependence of fW C on nA , T and Hk is the\norigin of the strong dependences of all other properties of\nthe system on these physical variables. To get a feeling\n\n\f3\nfor the expected dependences, consider the case in which\nT and Hk are small enough that the Fermi liquid free\nenergy can be well approximated by its zero temperature\nvalue, but large enough that we can ignore the (exponen\u221a\ntially small[15, 16] in powers of rs ) magnetic exchange\nenergy in the Wigner crystal. In this case, and in the\nabsence of disorder, the difference in free energy per unit\narea between the uniform WC and FL phases is\n\u2206F (nA , T, Hk ) = \u2206E(nA ) \u2212 nA T log[2 cosh(Hk /2T )].\n(3)\nSince fW C is determined by the competition between the\nlocal tendency to phase separation and the Coulomb interaction, it is a smooth function of \u2206F ; we can obtain\nthe T dependence of fW C from the T dependence of \u2206F\nby the chain rule. For Hk = 0, since \u2206F is a linear\nfunction of T , it follows that fW C is as well.\nDrag in a dilute bubble liquid: The reasons that\nRD is so small in a Fermi liquid are not hard to fathom.\nThe fluctuations in the charge density in the active layer\nare small when T /EF is small, and are further reduced\n\u221a\nwhen averaged over a large length scale, d \u226b 1/ nA ,\nhence the dependances exhibited in Eq. 2. In a microemulsion WC bubble phase, by contrast, there are\nlarge amplitude charge inhomogeneities on the length\nscale, LB , which implies strong coupling to the electrons\nin the passive layer.\nIn the regime when the bubble concentration is small\nthere are two types of the current carriers in the active\nlayer: electrons and crystalline bubbles. At zero temperature the electron Fermi-liquid contribution to the drag\nresistance vanishes and the drag effect is entirely due to\nmotion of Wigner crystallites.\nEach Wigner crystal bubble in the active layer casts\nan image potential in the passive layer. As bubbles in\nthe active layer move with respect to the passive one, the\nelectrons in the passive layer scatter on the moving image\npotential. To compute the drag resistance, we compute\nthe mean force per unit area, FP A , exerted on the electron fluid in the passive layer when a current J is passed\nthrough the active layer. In the linear response regime,\nit is clear that FP A \u221d nB vB where nB = fW C /\u03c0L2B is\nthe concentration of bubbles and vB is the mean drift\nvelocity of the bubbles. Thus\nRD =\n\nnB\n1\nAD \u03bcB\ne2\nnA\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bcB \u2261 vB /v\u0304 is the relative mobility of the bubbles,\nv\u0304 \u2261 J/enA is the mean electron drift velocity in the active layer, and AD is a dimensionless constant (discussed\nbelow) which depends on the properties of the electron\nliquid in the passive layer.\nIn the absence of disorder, \u03bcB \u2192 1. Moreover, as we\nwill discuss below, \u03bcB remains non-zero in the presence\nof weak disorder so long as we are dealing with a bubble\nliquid phase. Thus, RD is similarly non vanishing as\nT \u2192 0! Moreover, at low temperatures, the dominant T\nand Hk dependances of RD are through the dependence\n\nof fW C on these variables - i.e. the Pomeranchuk effect\ndiscussed above.\nThe physics of the proportionality constant AD is in\ngeneral, complicated - similar complexities occur as in\nthe closely related problem of electro-migration in metals. To compute AD we need to assess the nature of\nthe scattering potential induced in the passive layer by\na bubble in the active layer. The long range tails of potential are screened away by the electrons in the passive\nlayer. The magnitude of the potential, VB \u223c ed\u2206n, is\ndetermined by the magnitude of the charge deficit in the\nactive layer, \u2206n, associated with the bubble. From the\npreviously mentioned scaling of \u2206n with d, it\n\u221afollows that\nthe WKB barrier penetration factor, W = meVB LB is\nlarger than 1, so the potential behaves like a hard object\nof radius \u223c LB being dragged through the passive layer electron tunnelling through the image potential is negligible. This is one of the key reasons that a bubble phase\nproduces a large drag resistance.\nIt requires additional microscopic analysis to obtain\nan estimate of AD , and there are numerous \"regimes\"\n\u22121/2\n(the mean spacdepending on the relative values of nB\ning between bubbles), LB , and the elastic and inelastic\nmean-free paths, lel and le\u2212e , in the passive layer. The\nimportant general point is that AD is not generally small.\nTo give a concrete example, consider the case in which\n\u22121/2\nnB\n\u226b lel \u226b LB and lee \u226b lel . In this case, each bubble acts as an uncorrelated scattering center with cross\nsection proportional to LB , and consequently\n1/2\n\nAD = LB nP\n\n(5)\n\nIn a future paper, we will report an analysis of AD in the\nvarious other regimes.\nBubble mobility. In the absence of quenched disorder, there are two distinct bubble phases - the bubble\ncrystal and the bubble fluid.\nIn the bubble liquid in the absence of pinning, the bubbles are swept along with the fluid, so that \u03bcB = 1 and\nR = RD . In the presence of weak disorder, we still expect that \u03bcB \u2248 1 at temperatures large compared to the\npinning potential, although in this case, the additional\nchannels for momentum relaxation in the active layer will\ngenerally result in R > RD .\nThe T \u2192 0 behavior of \u03bcB is a more subtle issue. At\nnA d2 \u226b 1 the bubbles are large compared to the spacing\nbetween electrons. To first order they can be treated\nas classical objects - at this level of approximation, they\nare pinned at favorable sites of the disorder potential.\nQuantum mechanically, however, the bubbles can tunnel\nfrom one pinning site to another. Moreover, the fact\nthat the number of bubbles is only conserved on average\naffects the nature of this tunnelling process profoundly.\nSpecifically, since the Fermi liquid degrees of freedom are\n\"fast,\" we can integrate them out to obtain an effective\naction for the bubbles. (This can be done simply, using\nthe method of Levitov and Shytov[18], as we will show\nin a forthcoming paper.) Among other interactions that\n\n\f4\nare generated by doing this is an effective bubble hopping\n~ R\n~ \u2032 ) \u223c |R\n~ \u2212R\n~ \u2032 |\u2212\u03b2 where \u03b2 \u221d 1/G\nmatrix element, t(R,\nand G is the conductance of the Fermi fluid in units of e2 .\nPhysically, this derives from a process in which a bubble\n~ virtually melts, the associated electron\nat pinning site R\ndensity deficit propagates through the Fermi fluid, and\n~ \u2032 . It is well known [19] that for\nthen recrystallizes at site R\n\u03b2 < D, where D = 2 is the spatial dimension, Anderson\nlocalization does not occur. This establishes that, for\nclean enough systems, the bubbles, although large, are\nnot localized. \u03bcB is typically a fairly strongly increasing\nfunction of T , but it approaches a non-zero value as T \u2192\n0 if G is large enough!\nQualitative comparison with experiment: The\ntheoretical model sketched above contains the ingredients necessary for a qualitative understanding of much\nconcerning the listed experiments:\nThe drag resistance in the WC bubble phase RD is\nnot parametrically small, either in powers of 1/kF d or of\nT /EF , as in the Fermi liquid, which accounts for point\n1 in the above. According to Eq. 5 RD is proportional to nB and \u03bcB . Since L0 is T and Hk independent, nB \u221d fW C , so the general features of the T and\nHk dependances of RD and R, points 2, 3, 4, 6, and\n7, follow directly from the Pomeranchuk effect, and the\ninterplay between the T and Hk dependence is readily\nunderstood from Eq. 3. In particular, fW C and, consequently, RD are increasing function of Hk which saturate\nat Hk > H \u2217 . When the spins are polarized by Hk > T ,\nthey no longer have any entropy, so the T dependence\nof fW C and the corresponding contribution to the T dependence of RD (T ) are quenched.\nIn the case of very small disorder \u03bcB is close to unity\nand does not exhibit strong T and Hk dependances. Then\nR(T, Hk ) is entirely determined by the aforementioned\ndependances of nB . The more detailed T -dependances\nof RD (T, Hk ), points 2 , cannot be discussed without a\nmicroscopic calculation of \u03bcB (T, Hk ). .\n\nSince the dominant T and Hk dependances of RD and\nR derive from their implicit dependence of fW C , it is\nunsurprising that these dependances are similar.\nIt is an unavoidable consequence of the existence of microemulsion phases that, in the absence of quenched disorder, there is a sequence of continuous phase transitions\n(as opposed to a putative first order WC to FL transition) between different microemulsion phases and between these phases and the low and high density uniform\nphases. These phases become increasingly less conducting with decreasing nA , until the limiting WC phase is\ninsulating. Thus, for weak enough disorder, an apparent\nmetal insulator transition is inevitable, thus accounting\nfor the observation that gave the subject its name, point\n6. Since \u03bcB does not vanish as T \u2192 0 the conceptually\nkey conclusion of our analysis is that RD does not vanish as T \u2192 0 in the WC bubble phase: RD (T = 0) 6= 0.\nThis fact has not been confirmed experimentally, perhaps\nbecause RD (T = 0) is small.\nFinally we would like to compare our approach with\nthat of Ref. [21], to the experimental data on the drag\nresistance. The approach of Ref. [21] is supposed to work\nwell at high electron concentration far from the regime\nof phase separation. Extending the results of [21] to the\nregime of low n one, in principle, can explain the large\nvalue of RD . On the other hand we suspect that the\ndramatic increase of RD (Hk ) in the magnetic field and\nquenching it's temperature dependence in low n samples\ncan not be simply explained using that approach.\n\n[1] For a review, see E.
