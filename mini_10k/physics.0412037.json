Statistical properties of swarm\ndynamics in the weak noise limit are further analytically investigated.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn different natural and social systems, agents form\ngroups characterized by cooperative coherent motion [1].\nSuch collective swarm motions have been observed and\ninvestigated in bacterial populations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], in\nslime molds [7, 8, 9, 10], for the ants [11, 12] and fish\n[13, 14, 15], in the motion of pedestrians [16] and for the\ncar traffic [17]. To describe these phenomena, various\nmodels of collective coherent motion in populations of\nself-propelled or self-driven particles have been proposed\n(see [18, 19]). Some of them are formulated in terms\nof interacting automata located on a lattice or having\ncontinuous coordinates [20, 21, 22, 23]. A different class\nof models is based on dynamical equations for individual self-propelled particles, including velocity-dependent\nnegative friction terms to account for their active motion and assuming that interactions between the particles are described by some binary potentials. This latter\napproach has been used to phenomenologically characterize motion of biological organisms [24, 25], individual blood cells [26, 27] and humans [16, 28], and to describe the behavior of physical particles with energy depots [29, 30, 31, 32]. Effective dynamical equations with\nvelocity-dependent friction could be approximately derived for floating particles which propel themselves by\nreleasing surfactant into the medium [33]. A continuum approximation to discrete particle models, hydrodynamical models of active fluids have been proposed\n[19, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38].\nThe common property of all swarm models is that they\nshow the emergence of coherent collective flows starting\nfrom a disordered state with random velocity directions\nof individual particles (agents). Such kinetic transitions\nhave been extensively investigated for the automata systems [20, 39] and in the framework of hydrodynamics\n[34, 37]. The ordered states of swarms can represent\nsimple translational motion or be characterized by vortex flows. Both spatially distributed and localized swarm\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: udo.erdmann@physik.hu-berlin.de\n\nstates are possible. In a distributed state, the population\nfills the entire available medium. In contrast to this, the\npopulation forms compact spatial groups in a localized\nstate. An interesting example of a localized swarm state\nis a rotating flock of finite extent, seen in the simulations of a discrete model of self-propelling particles and\ndescribed analytically within a continuum active fluid approximation [23] (see also [19]).\nLocalized states of swarms may undergo transitions\nleading to new dynamical regimes, when the system parameters or the noise intensity are gradually changed.\nIn the previous publication [40], a noise-induced transition from the localized state with translational motion\nto a state with incoherent oscillations without translational motion was investigated numerically and analytically for a one-dimensional system of interacting selfpropelled particles. In the present article, we extend investigations of this system to two spatial dimensions. We\nstudy here a population of self-propelled particles interacting via a parabolic interaction potential corresponding\nto linear attracting forces between the pairs. In absence\nof noise, this dynamical system has two kinds of attractors, corresponding, respectively, to a compact traveling\nstate of the entire population and to a state where it rotates as a vortex without any global translational motion.\nThe aim of our study is to investigate effects of noise on\ntranslational swarm motion. We find that the system\nis highly sensitive to stochastic forces. When noise is\npresent, the traveling swarm is a cloud of particles characterized by different dispersions in the directions parallel\nand transverse to the direction of translational motion.\nOur numerical simulations confirmed by an approximate\nanalytical study show that the mean-square transverse\ndispersion of a swarm is proportional to the square root\nof the noise intensity, whereas its dispersion along the direction of motion depends linearly on the noise intensity.\nTherefore, for weak noises the swarm looks like a pancake\noriented orthogonally to the motion direction. When the\nnoise is increased, the swarm gradually acquires a more\nsymmetric shape. For strong noises, we find that the\ntranslational motion of a swarm becomes suddenly impossible and is abruptly replaced by a rotational regime\nwith a vortex flow. The detailed formulation of the model\n\n\f2\nis presented in the next section. In Sect. III we describe\nthe results of numerical simulations. The statistical properties of a traveling swarm in the weak noise limit are approximately explained by an analytical theory which is\nconstructed in Sect. IV. The paper ends with conclusions\nand discussion of obtained results.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider a swarm formed by N identical selfpropelled particles of unit mass interacting via an attractive parabolic pair potential. The dynamics of the system\nis given by the following set of evolution equations:\n\u1e59i = vi\n\n(1a)\n\nv\u0307i = Fi \u2212\n\na\nN\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\n(ri \u2212 rj ) + \u03bei (t).\n\n(1b)\n\nThe forces Fi depend on the particle velocity and are\nintroduced to take into account active motion of particles.\nWe choose them in the form\nFi = (1 \u2212\n\nvi2 )vi\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nso that, in absence of noise and interactions, the particle\nacquires the unit velocity v = 1. Additionally, the particles are subject to stochastic white forces \u03bei of strength\nD which are independent for different particles and are\ncharacterized by the correlation functions\nh\u03bei (t)i = 0 ,\n\nh\u03bei (t)\u03bej (t\u2032 )i = 2D\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4ij .\n\nThis model has previously been introduced in [40]. It\nis phenomenological, but rather general because it can be\nviewed as a normal form for a population of particles near\na supercritical bifurcation corresponding to spontaneous\nonset of active motion (see [19]). In this model, attractive interactions between particles have an infinite range\nand grow linearly with the separation between them. Because we shall consider only spatially localized states of\nthe population, our results will hold, however, also for\nthe situations when interactions are characterized by a\nfinite range, but it is much larger than the mean swarm\ndiameter. It should be noted that, in a different context,\nthe model (1) has been considered already by Rayleigh\n[41].\nThe study of the one-dimensional version of the\nmodel (1) has shown that, as the noise intensity D is increased, spontaneous breakdown of translational swarm\nmotion takes place here [40]. Some statistical properties of translational swarm motion in the two-dimensional\nmodel (1) (with a slightly different choice of the forces\nFi ) have subsequently been discussed [42]. For the case of\ntwo interacting particles (N = 2), the rotational modes\nwere described in [32], where simulations for small rotating clusters consisting of 20 particles have also been\nreported. The aim of the present work is to perform systematic, numerical and analytical, investigations of the\nbehavior described by this two-dimensional model.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nNumerical integration of equations (1) was performed\nusing the Euler scheme with the constant time step of\n0.001. In all simulations, the total number of particles\nwas fixed to N = 300 and the coefficient a specifying\nthe strength of interactions between the particles was set\nto a = 100. To produce a traveling localized state of\nthe swarm, special initial conditions were used. At time\nt = 0, all particles had identical positions and velocities\nand the noise was switched only a little later, at time\nt = 30.\nSeveral statistical characteristics of the swarm were\nmonitored during simulations. The center of mass R of\nthe swarm and itsP\nmean velocity V at time t P\nwere defined\nas R(t) = (1/N ) i ri (t) and V(t) = (1/N ) i vi (t), respectively. Because the cloud of traveling particles in the\npresence of noise was anisotropic, we also determined its\ninstantaneous mean-square dispersions in the directions\nparallel (Sk ) and orthogonal (S\u22a5 ) to the direction of its\ninstantaneous mean velocity V. They were defined as\nN\n\nSk (t) =\n\nX\n1\n2\n[(ri (t) \u2212 R(t)) * V(t)]\n2\nN V (t) i=1\n\nS\u22a5 (t) =\n\nX\n1\n[(ri (t) \u2212 R(t)) \u00d7 V(t)]2 . (3b)\n2\nN V (t) i=1\n\n(3a)\n\nN\n\nAdditionally, angular momenta of all particles with respect to the mass center were determined as\nLi (t) = (ri (t) \u2212 R(t)) \u00d7 (vi (t) \u2212 V(t)) .\n\n(4)\n\nFigure 1(a) shows the time dependences of the magnitude V = |V| of the mean swarm velocity for two simulations with different noises. When the noise is relatively\nweak (D = 0.067), its introduction leads to some fluctuations in the instantaneous swarm velocity and a decrease\nof its average level. If a stronger noise (D = 0.07) is applied, the swarm velocity first behaves as for the weaker\nnoise, but then abruptly drops down to a value close to\nzero. This sudden transition corresponds to the breakdown of translational motion of the swarm. In Fig. 1(b)\nwe have plotted the time-averaged swarm velocity hV i as\nthe function of the noise intensity D. The average velocity gradually decreases with noise, until the breakdown\noccurs at 0.067 < D < 0.070.\nIn the state with translational motion at relatively\nweak noises, the direction of the swarm motion does not\nremain constant with time. The swarm travels along a\ncomplex trajectory, part of which is shown in Fig. 2 (such\ntrajectories should correspond to the Brownian motion of\nthe entire swarm). In the inset in this figure, we display\nthe distribution of particles in the swarm at some time\nmoment. It can be noticed that the cloud of particles is\nsignificantly squeezed along the direction of swarm motion.\nFigure 3 shows the computed average longitudinal (Sk )\nand transverse (S\u22a5 ) dispersions as functions of the noise\n\n\f3\n225.9\nt = 1140\n\n1\n\n223.43\n\nt = 1180\n\n223.4\n\n0.8\n225\ny\n\n223.3\n\n|V|\n\ny\n\n0.6\n\nt = 1170\n\n0.4\n\n223.2\n\n224\n223.16\n832.649\n\n832.7\n\n832.8\n\nx\n\n0.2\nt = 1160\n\nt = 1120 t = 1130\n\nt = 1150\n\n223.2\n\n0\n\n820\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\nt\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n830\n\n3000\n\n840\n\n850\n\n860\n\n870\n\nx\n\nFIG. 2: Motion of the center of mass of the swarm (300 particles) within a certain time window for noise below a critical\none.

Below we\nderive approximate analytical expressions for Sk and\nS\u22a5 in the limit of the small noise intensity D \u2192 0.\nFirst, we note that in this limit the motion of the center\nof mass of the swarm will remain approximately linear\nwithin very long times or, in other words, the swarm\nvelocity V remains approximately constant on the short\ntime scales characteristic for the motions of individual\n\n\f5\nparticles inside the traveling swarm. We introduce the\ncoordinate system in such a way that its x-axis is parallel\nto the direction of the swarm motion and its y-axis is\northogonal to it. The coordinates xi and yi of all particles\nforming the swarm can be written as xi = X + \u03b4xi and\nyi = Y + \u03b4yi where X and Y are the coordinates of the\nswarm center R. By our choice, we have Y = 0, so that\nyi = \u03b4yi .\nTo derive the evolution equation for X, we notice that\n\nX(t) =\n\nN\n1 X\nxi (t) \u2261 hxi (t)i .\nN i=1\n\n(5)\n\nSumming up the evolution equations for all xi , we approximately obtain\n\u0011\nD 2E\n\u0010\n2\n \u0307\n\u1e8c \u2212 1 \u2212 \u1e8a 2 \u1e8a \u2212 3 \u03b4x\n(6)\ni \u1e8a \u2212 \u1e8fi \u1e8a = 0\nwhere we have neglected the terms with the higher pow \u0307 i and \u1e8fi .\ners of velocity fluctuations \u03b4x\nIn the statistical steady state, \u1e8a = V = const and (6)\nis reduced to the equation\ni\nh\nD 2E\n\u0001\n2\n \u0307\nV =0\n(7)\n1 \u2212 V 2 \u2212 3 \u03b4x\ni \u2212 \u1e8fi\ndetermining the velocity of swarm motion in the presence\nof noise. Its solution for the traveling swarm (V 6= 0) is\nD 2E\n2\n \u0307\nV 2 = 1 \u2212 3 \u03b4x\n(8)\ni \u2212 \u1e8fi .\nThe evolution equation for \u03b4xi can be obtained by subtracting equation (6) from the equation for the variable\nxi in the model (1). Keeping only the leading terms,\nlinear in deviations from the mass center, we get\n \u0308 i + 2\u03b4x\n \u0307 i + a\u03b4xi = \u03be x (t)\n\u03b4x\ni\n\n(9)\n\nThis is an evolution equation for a damped harmonical\noscillator. Note that fluctuations of xi (t) are not coupled\nto the transverse component yi (t).\nIn a similar way, the evolution equation for the transverse deviations yi (t) can be obtained,\n\u0001\n \u0307 i \u1e8fi + \u1e8f 3 + ayi = \u03be y (t) (10)\n\u00ffi \u2212 1 \u2212 V 2 \u1e8fi + 2V \u03b4x\ni\ni\n\nIn this equation, we have retained nonlinear terms. This\nis done because such terms are essential for the damping\nof oscillations of the transverse component.\nIndeed, if such terms are neglected, we would have\n\u0001\n\u00ffi \u2212 1 \u2212 V 2 \u1e8fi + ayi = \u03beiy (t) .\n(11)\n\nBecause, as follows from equation (8), we have V 2 <\n1, oscillations in yi would then exponentially grow with\ntime. Thus, nonlinear terms play a principal role for\ntransverse fluctuations and cannot be neglected even in\nthe weak noise limit, in contrast to the respective terms\nfor the longitudinal fluctuations \u03b4xi .\n\nAs shall be verified at the end of our derivation, the\n \u0307 2 i holds in the weak noise limit.\ncondition h\u1e8fi2 i \u226b h\u03b4x\ni\nTherefore, the swarm velocity is mostly influenced by\nthe transverse fluctuations and we have approximately\nV 2 = 1 \u2212 \u1e8fi2 . Substituting this into (10), we get\n\u0001\n(12)\n\u00ffi \u2212 \u1e8fi2 \u2212 \u1e8fi2 \u1e8fi + ayi = \u03beiy (t)\n\nThe stochastic differential equation (12) does not include longitudinal fluctuations \u03b4xi and, furthermore,\nfluctuations for different particles i are not coupled here.\nFor subsequent analysis of this differential equation, we\ndrop the indices and write as\n\u0001\n(13)\n\u00ff \u2212 \u1e8f 2 \u2212 \u1e8f 2 \u1e8f + ay = \u03be(t)\n\nwith h\u03be(t)\u03be \u2032 (t)i = 2D\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). Here we have assumed\nthat statistical averaging is equivalent to averaging over\nthe ensemble.\nThe approximate solution for the probability distribution of variable y in the statistical stationary state can\nbe derived for this equation assuming that the parameter\na, determining the oscillation frequency, is large (a \u226b 1).\nWe introduce slowly varying amplitudes\ny(t) = \u03b7(t)ei\u03c9t + \u03b7 \u2217 (t)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n(14)\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c9 = a \u226b 1.

Comparing these analytical estimates with the simulations in Fig. 7, we find\nthat they agree well with the respective numerical data.\nFor the transverse dispersion, the agreement is found in a\nwide interval of noise intensities.

Our numerical simulations show that\nthe swarm is highly sensitive to the action of noise. Even\nvery weak noises lead to strong dispersion of the swarm\nalong the direction orthogonal to the direction of its\ntranslational motion. The approximate analytical theory predicts\u221athat the transverse dispersion of aswarm increases as D with the noise intensity D, whereas its\nlongitudinal dispersion depends linearly on D in the limit\nD \u2192 0 and remains therefore much smaller in this limit.\nHence, for weak noises the traveling swarm is strongly\nsqueezed along the direction of its mass motion. This\nanalytical result is confirmed by numerical simulations.\nIncreasing the noise intensity D, we find that translational motion breaks down when a certain critical intensity is reached. After the breakdown, the translational\n\n\f7\nmotion is stopped and instead the swarm goes into a rotational mode where the center of mass of the swarm shows\nonly weak random motion. This behavior resembles the\nbreakdown of translational motion which was previously\nseen for the one-dimensional system [40]. In contrast to\nthe one-dimensional case, we could not however analytically treat this transition, because of the strong fluctuations in the transverse direction.\nThough our results are obtained in the model with harmonic attractive interactions, they are also be applicable\nfor the models with finite-range attractive interactions\nbetween the particles, provided that the size of a localized\nswarm (i.e., the statistical dispersion of the coordinates\nof its particles with respect to the mass center) is much\nsmaller than the interaction radius. In this situation, a\nharmonic approximation of the interaction potential can\n\nbe applied. Moreover, similar effects can be expected for\nswarms in three-dimensional media. It would be interesting to see whether the discussed behavior is indeed\ncharacteristic for real biological swarms with long-range\ninteractions between individual organisms, such as bird\nflocks or fish schools.\n\n[1] E.
