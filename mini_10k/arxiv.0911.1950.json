We discuss the constraints on the parameters of a Yukawa interaction obtained from the indirect measurements of the Casimir pressure between parallel plates using the sphere-plate configuration.\nRecently, it was claimed in the literature that the application of the proximity force approximation (PFA)\nto the calculation of a Yukawa interaction in the sphere-plate configuration could lead to a large error of\norder 100% in the constraints obtained. Here we re-calculate the constraints both exactly and using the\nPFA, and arrive at identical results. We elucidate the reasons why an incorrect conclusion was obtained\nsuggesting that the PFA is inapplicable to calculate the Yukawa force.\n\nThe Yukawa-type corrections to Newtonian gravitational law are predicted from the exchange of light elementary particles and in some extra-dimensional generalizations of the standard model. Within a short interaction range of around 0.1 \u03bcm the strongest constraints on\nthe parameters of Yukawa interaction were obtained from\nthe indirect dynamic measurement of the Casimir pressure between two parallel plates using the configuration\nof an Au-coated sphere above an Au-coated plate of a micromachined oscillator [1,2]. In [1,2] this was done using\nwhat is referred to as the proximity force approximation\n(PFA) [3] for the calculation of the Yukawa force acting\nbetween a sphere and a plate. For two point-like particles\nwith masses m1 and m2 spaced at a separation r apart,\nthe Yukawa corrections to Newtonian gravity are conventionally presented in the form [4,5]\nVYu (r) = \u2212\n\n\u03b1Gm1 m2 \u2212r/\u03bb\ne\n,\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, \u03b1 and \u03bb are the\nstrength and the interaction range of the Yukawa interaction, respectively.\nReference [6] especially investigated the possibility of\ncalculating the gravitational and Yukawa-type interactions\nin sphere-plate configuration using the PFA. In so doing\ntwo formulations of the PFA were presented. In the most\ngeneral formulation [7] the force of interaction is found\nas an integral of the known force between parallel surface\nelements. According to the simplified formulation of the\na\n\nE-mail: Vladimir.Mostepanenko@itp.uni-leipzig.de\n\nPFA, valid under certain conditions, the force is equal to\n2\u03c0RE where R is the sphere radius and E is the energy\nper unit area in the configuration of two parallel plates\n[3]. In [6] the applicability of different formulations of the\nPFA for the calculation of Yukawa and gravitational interactions in the experimental configuration of [1,2] was\nconfirmed. Specifically, it was shown that for the gravitational and Yukawa-type interactions between a compact\nbody and a plane plate of infinitely large area the most\ngeneral formulation of the PFA leads to the exact results.\nThe simplified formulation of the PFA was shown to be\napproximately applicable to the Yukawa interaction.\nMotivated by [6], the subsequent paper [8] discussed\nthe same subject. In agreement with [6], paper [8] arrives at the conclusion that the level of precision in using the two formulations of the PFA to evaluate Yukawa\nforces in the sphere-plane geometry \"is of the same order\nof magnitude as the Casimir theory-experiment comparison that uses PFA to compute the sphere-plate Casimir\nforce.\" On the basis of [9,10,11,12,13,14] it was also concluded [6] that for the experimental configuration of [1,2]\nwith a/R \u2248 0.001 (a is the closest separation between a\nsphere and a plate, R is the sphere radius) the relative error in the Casimir force due to the use of the PFA is about\n0.1%. The same conclusion was reached in [8] on the basis\nof [11,12,15,16]. Specifically, [8] states that \"the PFA... is\nexpected to approximate the exact Casimir force within\n0.1%.\" Thus, in both papers [6,8] it is recognized that in\nrecent experiment [1,2] the error in the evaluation of the\nYukawa-type force between a sphere and a plate using the\nsimplified formulation of the PFA is of about 0.1%.\n\n\f2\n\nE. Fischbach et al.: On the validity of constraints\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the previous discussion, which\nsupports the use of the PFA, [8] claims that the constraints\non \u03b1, \u03bb from the precision dynamic measurements of the\nCasimir force obtained in [1,2] could have \"a large order of\n100% correction.\" According to [8], \"Considering the relatively small margins of improvement reported recently\n(see for instance Fig. 3 in [21]), a systematic shift due to\nthe use of the PFA instead of EPFA may lead to significant changes for the exclusion region in the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb plane.\"\nWe recall that [21] cited in [8] is just our reference [2] and\nEPFA is equivalent to the exact calculation. By way of\ncontrast, [6] confirmed the validity of the constraints obtained in [1,2]. Since these constraints are now included\nin the Review of Particle Physics (Particle Data Group)\nfor the year 2008 [17], it seems necessary to verify whether\nthe claim of [8] which casts doubts on these constraints is\ncorrect. In what follows we repeat the derivation of the\nconstraints on (\u03b1, \u03bb) from the experimental data of [1,2]\nusing the exact formulas for the Yukawa-type interaction,\nand arrive at the same results as obtained in [1,2] using\nthe simplified formulation of the PFA. We show that the\nuse of the simplified formulation of the PFA within its applicability region for the calculation of Yukawa-type forces\ncannot lead to any systematic shifts in the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb plane not\nonly in already performed experiments but in presumably\nmuch more precise future experiments as well. Because of\nthis it is not correct to call this formulation of the PFA\n\"an invalid approximation to compute volumetric forces\"\n[8]. As for any approximation, the simplified PFA is applicable in some ranges of parameters (see below) and is\nnot applicable outside of these ranges. Several other misleading statements of [8] are also commented upon below.\nTo begin our derivation, it is pertinent to recall that\nin the experiment of [1,2] the separation distance between\na sphere of R = 151.3 \u03bcm radius and a plate was varied\nharmonically with time, and the directly measured quantity was the frequency shift of the oscillator under the\ninfluence of the Casimir force acting between the two bodies. Due to the properties of the oscillator, this frequency\nshift is proportional to the gradient of the Casimir force.\nUsing the simplified PFA, this gradient turns out to be\nproportional to the effective Casimir pressure in the configuration of two parallel plates. Thus, in this experiment\none indirectly measures the Casimir pressure between two\nparallel plates (see the recent review [18] for a detailed justification of this statement). To obtain constraints on the\nparameters of Yukawa-type interaction \u03b1 and \u03bb in [1,2,19]\nit was supposed that the gradient of theYukawa-type force\nis proportional to the Yukawa-type pressure between the\ntwo parallel plates, i.e., the simplified PFA was applied to\nthe Yukawa-type forces. As a result, the constraints were\nobtained from the inequality\n|P Yu (a)| \u2264 \u039e\u0303(a),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere [\u2212\u039e\u0303(a), \u039e\u0303(a)] is the minimum confidence interval\n[1] containing all differences P theor (a) \u2212 P\u0304 expt (a) within\nthe separation region 180 nm < a < 746 nm. The Yukawa\npressure between two parallel plates is given by\nP Yu (a) = \u22122\u03c0G\u03b1\u03bb2 e\u2212a/\u03bb\n\nh\n(s)\n\u00d7 \u03c1Au \u2212 (\u03c1Au \u2212 \u03c1Cr ) e\u2212\u2206Au /\u03bb\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\n\u2212(\u03c1Cr \u2212 \u03c1s ) e\u2212(\u2206Au +\u2206Cr )/\u03bb\n\ni\n\nh\n(p)\n\u00d7 \u03c1Au \u2212 (\u03c1Au \u2212 \u03c1Cr ) e\u2212\u2206Au /\u03bb\ni\n(p)\n(p)\n\u2212(\u03c1Cr \u2212 \u03c1Si ) e\u2212(\u2206Au +\u2206Cr )/\u03bb .\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\n(p)\n\n(3)\n\n(p)\n\nHere, \u2206Au , \u2206Cr , \u2206Au , and \u2206Cr are the thicknesses of the\nAu and Cr layers with the densities \u03c1Au and \u03c1Cr on the\nsphere and the plate, made of sapphire with density \u03c1s\nand Si with density \u03c1Si , respectively (the values of all parameters are contained in [1,2]).\nTo verify the constraints obtained in [1,2] from Eq. (2)\nbased on the use of the simplified PFA for Yukawa forces,\nwe return instead to the original inequality following from\nthe experimental data, i.e., that the gradient of the Yukawa\nforce normalized to 2\u03c0R belongs to the confidence interval\ndetermined at a 95% confidence level\nYu\n(a)\n1 \u2202Fsp\n\u2264 \u039e\u0303(a).\n2\u03c0R\n\u2202a\n\n(4)\n\nYu\nHere, Fsp\n(a) is the Yukawa-type force for the configuration of a sapphire sphere and Si plate, both covered with\nCr and Au layers. Equation (4) has never been used in previous literature (including [1,2,19]) to obtain constraints\non the parameters of the Yukawa-type interaction from the\nmeasurements of the Casimir force. When dealing with the\nYukawa interaction for the experimental parameters of [1,\n2], the plate can be considered as infinitely large. This was\nproved in [20] and confirmed in [8]. The exact expression\nYu\nfor Fsp\nacting between a homogeneous sphere and a plane\nplate of sufficiently large area and thickness (as in experiment [1,2]) was found in Eq. (6) of [21]. Applying this\nequation to the layer structure of [1,2], one arrives at\nh\nYu\nFsp\n(a) = \u22124\u03c0 2 G\u03b1\u03bb3 e\u2212a/\u03bb \u03c1Au \u03a6(R, \u03bb)\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\n\u2212 (\u03c1Au \u2212 \u03c1Cr ) \u03a6(R \u2212 \u2206Au , \u03bb) e\u2212\u2206Au /\u03bb\n\u2212 (\u03c1Cr \u2212 \u03c1s ) \u03a6(R \u2212\n\n(s)\n\u2206Au\n\n\u2212\n\n(5)\n\n(s)\n\u2206Cr , \u03bb)\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\n\u00d7e\u2212(\u2206Au +\u2206Cr )/\u03bb\n\ni\n\nh\n(p)\n\u00d7 \u03c1Au \u2212 (\u03c1Au \u2212 \u03c1Cr ) e\u2212\u2206Au /\u03bb\n(p)\n\n(p)\n\n\u2212(\u03c1Cr \u2212 \u03c1Si ) e\u2212(\u2206Au +\u2206Cr )/\u03bb\ni\n(p)\n(p)\n(p)\n\u2212\u03c1Si e\u2212(\u2206Au +\u2206Cr +\u2206Si )/\u03bb ,\nwhere\n\u03a6(r, \u03bb) \u2261 \u03a6exact (r, \u03bb) = r \u2212 \u03bb + (r + \u03bb) e\u22122r/\u03bb .\n\n(6)\n\nNote that if we put\n\u03a6(r, \u03bb) = \u03a6PFA (r, \u03bb) \u2261 R,\n\n(7)\n\nYu,PFA\n(a) which is also expressible as\nEq.

Fischbach et al.: On the validity of constraints\n\nwhere E Yu (a) is the Yukawa energy per unit area of two\nparallel plates covered with thin layers as described above.\nNote that Eq. (8) is nothing but the simplified formulation\nof the PFA. The negative derivative of E Yu (a) with respect\nto a results in the Yukawa pressure between two parallel\nplates in Eq. (3).\nNote that the thickness of the lower plate mentioned\nin the explanations to Eq. (8) might be finite whereas the\nupper plate is a semispace (see paper [6]). This is because\nYu,PFA\nthe force Fsp\n(a) in the left-hand side of Eq. (8) can\ndepend only on the three geometrical parameters: separation a, sphere radius R and thickness of the lower plate D1\n(if it is not much larger than a, as in the experiments under discussion). However, Eq. (6) of [8] which is analogous\nto our Eq. (8) (the use of PYu instead of E Yu is a misprint)\ncontains in the right-hand side the energy per unit area\nof two parallel plates where the upper plate is of some\narbitrary finite thickness D2 . This equation is incorrect\nbecause its left-hand side does not depend on D2 . Using\nthis incorrect formulation of the PFA, paper [8] performed\nan extensive investigation of the dependence of F Yu,PFA\non D2 [see Eq. (9) and Figs. 2 and 3] which is physically\nmeaningless.\nWe next compare the constraints on the Yukawa parameters \u03b1, \u03bb obtained in [1,2] from Eqs. (2), (3) using the simplified PFA, and the exact results following\nfrom Eqs. (4)\u2013(6). According to [8], the larger \u03bb is, the\ngreater is the error in the constraints obtained using the\nPFA. The strongest constraints following from the data\nof Refs. [1,2] were obtained within the interaction range\n20 nm < \u03bb < 86 nm. Hence as the first example we compare the resulting constraints at \u03bb = 86 nm. For this fixed\n\u03bb the strongest constraints follow at a = 250 nm where the\nhalf-width of the confidence interval is \u039e\u0303(a) = 1.52 mPa\n[1]. From the exact Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) we then obtain\n\u03b1exact = 2.88167 \u00d7 1013 \u2248 2.88 \u00d7 1013 .\n\n(9)\n\nUsing the simplified PFA for the Yukawa interaction i.e.,\nfrom Eqs. (2) and (3), it follows that\n\u03b1PFA = 2.88011 \u00d7 1013 \u2248 2.88 \u00d7 1013 .\n\n(10)\n\nNote that only the latter value was obtained in [1], and\nused to plot the line separating the allowed and prohibited\nregions in the (\u03b1, \u03bb)-plane. It follows from a comparison\nof Eqs. (9) and (10) that the constraints on \u03b1, \u03bb obtained\nin [1] are exact, to the quoted level of precision.\nAs a second example, we consider the much larger\nvalue, \u03bb = 400 nm, in the beginning of the region where\nthe constraints obtained from the torsion pendulum experiment are the most stringent [20]. For this \u03bb the strongest\nconstraints are obtained from the Casimir force data at\na = 400 nm and the half-width of the confidence interval\nis \u039e\u0303(a) = 0.45 mPa [1]. In this case the exact results in\nEqs. (4)\u2013(6) yield\n\u03b1exact = 2.03189 \u00d7 1011 \u2248 2.0 \u00d7 1011 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhereas Eqs. (2) and (3) using the simplified PFA for the\nYukawa force lead to\n\u03b1PFA = 2.02708 \u00d7 1011 \u2248 2.0 \u00d7 1011 .\n\n(12)\n\n3\n\nThe latter value was used in [1] to plot the line separating\nthe allowed and prohibited regions in the (\u03b1, \u03bb)-plane.\nNote that the half-width of the confidence interval\n\u039e\u0303(a) is found from the total theoretical and experimental errors in the Casimir pressure determined at a 95%\nconfidence level. It takes into account all constituent errors, including the random and systematic experimental\nerrors. Also included are theoretical errors due to uncertainty of the optical data, and due to the use of the PFA.\nAs a quantity obtained from the errors, \u039e\u0303(a) is calculated\nto only two, or at maximum to three, significant figures\n[the latter happens at shortest separations alone where\n\u039e\u0303(a) is relatively large]. It would thus be an evidently inconsistent result if the two different determinations of the\nconstraints on (\u03b1, \u03bb) with two theoretical expressions for\nYu\nFsp\n(a) differing by only 0.1% would lead to markedly different strengths of the resulting constraints (to say nothing of the constraints differing by 100%, as discussed in\n[8]).\nOne can conclude that within the whole range of \u03bb\nconsidered in [1,2] the strength of the derived constraints\nis precisely the same irrespective of whether or not the\nsimplified PFA was used for the calculation of the Yukawatype interaction between the sphere and the plate.\nThe opposite conclusion mentioned above was arrived\nat in [8]. According to [8], exact computations of the Casimir force \"for the recent Casimir sphere-plane experiment\n[21] (here [2])... gives a deviation from PFA of the order\nof 0.1% at the smallest value of a/R \u2248 0.001 reached in\nthe experiment (amin \u2248 160 nm). Since the limits to nonNewtonian forces are obtained using the residuals in the\nCasimir theory-experiment comparison, in order to meaningfully replace the exact formula of the Yukawa force\nwith its PFA approximation, the level of accuracy between\nthese two should be therefore a small fraction, for instance,\n10% of the accuracy with which the Casimir force is controlled by using PFA rather than the exact expression for\nthe sphere-plane Casimir force. If this condition is not fulfilled, the derived limits could be off also by a large order\nof 100% correction. However, targeting a 10% accuracy\nlevel with respect to the Casimir theory-experiment accuracy implies deviations from \u03b7 = 1 of 0.01%, which can be\nobtained... only in the range of \u03bb below 100 nm. The presence of substrates with different densities...\" leads to the\nsituation that \u03b7 \"in the case of the experiment reported in\n[21] (here [2]), is equal to 1.00126, i.e. a correction already\nequal to 0.126%.\" Thus, according to [8], the deviation of\nthe quantity \u03b7 from unity in the experiment [2] exceeds\nallowed deviations by a factor of 13 and this may lead to\norder of 100% correction to the obtained constraints.\nThis statement is based on a simple misunderstanding.\nThe key point is that the relative error in the maximum\nallowed value of \u03b1 obtained using the simplified PFA is\ndetermined by the sum of relative errors in \u039e\u0303(a) and in\nthe application of the PFA to calculate the Yukawa force.\nKeeping in mind that \u039e\u0303(a) has a meaning of an absolute\nerror, it is determined with only two or three significant\nfigures independently of its value. From this it follows that\n\u039e\u0303(a) can only be known with the relative error of about\n\n\f4\n\nE. Fischbach et al.: On the validity of constraints\n\n0.5%. As can be seen from the above citations, [8] mistakenly links a demand to the value of the relative error introduced by the application of the PFA to calculate\nthe Yukawa force (of about 0.01%) with the magnitude of\n\u039e\u0303(a) (or its constituent part due to the application of the\nPFA to calculate the Casimir force). Actually, to obtain\nconstraints on \u03b1 with the relative error of about 1% from\nthe data of any high precision future experiment on the\nmeasurement of the Casimir force, it is quite sufficient to\ncalculate the Yukawa force with a relative error of about\n0.1% [22]. For example, at a = \u03bb = 400 nm this calculation\ncan be safely performed using the simplified formulation\nof the PFA if the application conditions of this formulation (a, \u03bb \u226a R, D1 ) are satisfied [6]. Thus, the conclusion\nof [8] that the limits derived in [1,2] could have \"a large\norder of 100% correction\" is invalid.\n\nAcknowledgements\nE.F. was supported in part by DOE under Grant No. DE76ER071428.
