In 1997 Lagarias and Richardson proved that all convex curves satisfy\nthe DNA Inequality and asked whether this is true for some non-convex curve.\nThey conjectured that the DNA Inequality holds for certain L-shaped curves.\nIn this paper, we disprove this conjecture for all L-Shapes and construct a\nlarge class of non-convex curves for which the DNA Inequality holds. We also\ngive a polynomial-time procedure for determining whether any specific curve\nin a much larger class satisfies the DNA Inequality.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA simple plane closed curve \u0393 is said to satisfy the DNA Inequality if the average\ncurvature (which is the integral of the absolute value of curvature divided by the\nperimeter) of any closed curve contained within the region bounded by \u0393 exceeds\nthe average curvature of \u0393. (It is called the \"DNA Inequality\" because the picture\nis akin to a little piece of DNA inside of a cell.) In the following, we will refer to\nthe outside closed curve \u0393 as the \"cell,\" and the inside closed curve as the \"DNA\"\n(denoted \u03b3). All cells considered in this paper will be (non-self-intersecting) closed\npolygons, but the DNA closed curves are allowed to have self-intersections. The\nDNA Inequality has been proven to hold for all convex cells; see [1, 2, 3]. On the\nsecond page of the paper by Lagarias and Richardson [1] that proved it for convex\ncells, they raised the question whether the DNA Inequality might hold for some nonconvex cells. In particular, they suggested that some L-shaped regions might satisfy\nthe DNA inequality. Here an L-shaped region is a rectangle with a smaller rectangle\nremoved from one corner of it, cf. Section 2.\nThe question of when the DNA inequality might hold for non-convex cells is the\nfocus of this paper. We obtain three main results, stated below. In particular, for\n1\n\n\f(a) A polygon\nwhich satisfies the\nDNA Inequality\n\n(b) A polygon\nwhich doesn't\nsatisfy the DNA\nInequality\n\nFigure 1: Some Polygons\nthe polygons pictured in Figure 1, our results imply that the L-shaped polygon 1(b)\ndoes not satisfy the DNA inequality, however the non-convex quadrilateral 1(a) does\nsatisfy the DNA inequality.\nOur first result is as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. (Theorem 2.1.) The DNA inequality is false for all L-Shapes.\nThis result disproves the suggestion of Lagarias and Richarson [Conjecture p.2, 1].\nThis is shown in Section 2.\nOur second result is the main result of this paper. It shows that the DNA\nInequality does hold for a class of non-convex polygonal cells. These are cells obtained\nfrom particular convex polygons by putting an \"isosceles dent\" in a particular one of\nits sides. Namely, take some convex polygon P , and fix a side AB of that polygon.\nConstruct a point X such that \u2220XAB = \u2220XBA = \u03b4. In Figure 2 is pictured this\nconstruction when P is an isosceles right triangle, and AB is the hypotenuse.\nDefinition 1.1. For any convex polygon P with a fixed side AB, we denote the\ncurve which is created from P , replacing AB with the two segments AX and XB,\nwhich is pictured in Figure 2 as the bold curve, by P\u03b4 . (Thus, P\u03b4 is an \"isosceles\ndenting of P along AB.\") Given a convex polygon P and an edge E, we call (P, E) a\ndeformable DNA-polygon (called a DDNA-polygon for short) if there exists a \u03b40 > 0\nsuch that \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b40 implies that P\u03b4 satisfies the DNA Inequality.\nIn this paper, we both classify all DDNA-polygons and create a polynomial time algorithm for determining if a given curve in a larger class satisfies the DNA Inequality.\nThe following result classifies all DDNA-polygons.\n2\n\n\fA\n\u03b4\nX\n\n\u03b4\n\nB\n\nFigure 2: Example of P\u03b4\nTheorem 1.2. (Theorem 8.1.) If P is a convex polygon with perimeter p and we\nare denting an edge with length l, and \u03b1 is the larger of the two angles that the edge\nmakes with the two adjacent edges, then P is a DDNA-polygon (with respect to this\nedge) if and only if:\n1 + cos \u03b1\n2p \u2264 \u03c0l\n.\nsin \u03b1\nRemark. In this paper, we assume for simplicity that the dent XAB is isosceles. The\nmethods of this paper can still be applied if the triangle is not isosceles, or even if\nthere are multiple dents all depending on one parameter \u03b4, so long as adjacent sides\nare not dented and there exists \u01eb > 0, which does not depend on \u03b4, such that any\ntwo vertices of P\u03b4 are at least \u01eb apart.\nOur third result is algorithmic, and applies to a class of non-convex polygons\nwhich we term separable polygons. To define these, we say that an interior vertex of\na polygon \u0393 is a vertex contained in the interior of the convex hull of \u0393. A separable\npolygon \u0393 is a polygon having the property that for any point p in the interior of\nthe cell determined by \u0393, but not a vertex of \u0393, there is at most one interior vertex\nv of \u0393 such that the straight line determined by p and v intersects \u0393 in more than\ntwo points. We find a polynomial time algorithm, which when given a (non-convex)\nseparable polygon determines whether it satisfies the DNA Inequality.\nTheorem 1.3. (Theorem 6.1.) There exists an algorithm which when given as input\na separable polygon \u0393 specified by its n vertices, determines whether or not \u0393 satisfies\nthe DNA inequality, in number of elementary operations polynomial in n.\nWe analyze this algorithm using a simplified model of computation described in\nSection 6, in which an \"elementary operation\" is defined.\nIn Section 2, we prove Theorem 1.1. In Section 3, we set up the notation that we\nwill use for the proof of Theorem 1.2, and give an outline of the proof. In Section 4, we\n3\n\n\fprove some useful Lemmas that apply to any cell. In Section 5, we turn our attention\nto a special class of polygons (which we term \"separable polygons\"); we prove that\nthe DNA Inequality holds in any separable polygon if and only if it holds for some\nspecific types of DNA. In Section 6, we see that this produces a polynomial-time\nalgorithm to determine whether any separable polygon satisfies the DNA Inequality\n(Theorem 1.3). In Section 7, we determine, using the results from Section 5 as well\nas the results of [1] and [2], what happens when we have a sequence of non-convex\npolygons which approach a convex one. Finally, in Section 8 we state and prove\nTheorem 1.2, and a corollary which gives some sufficient and necessary conditions\nfor a polygon to be a DDNA-polygon.\nAcknowledgements.

The DNA inequality is false for all L-Shapes.\nProof. We proceed to construct a counterexample to the DNA Inequality for any\nL-Shape. Choose some sufficiently small \u03b8. (The size of \u03b8 is bounded above by the\ndimensions of the L-Shape, but it will be clear that some nonzero \u03b8 can always be chosen.) Construct points P \u2208 (A, B) and Q \u2208 (C, D) such that \u2220AY P = \u2220DY Q = \u03b8.\nWe consider the closed curve A, P, Y, Q, D, Y, A. (see Figure 3) Its curvature is\nclearly 3\u03c0 + 4\u03b8, and its perimeter is clearly (AY + Y D)(1 + sec(\u03b8) + tan(\u03b8)). The\ncurvature of the whole figure is 3\u03c0, and the perimeter is 2(AY + Y D). Therefore, to\n\n4\n\n\fA\n\nP\n\nB\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8\nX\n\nC\nQ\n\nY\n\n\u03b8\n\nD\n\nFigure 3: Counterexample for L-Shapes\ndisprove the DNA Inequality, we will show:\n3\u03c0 + 4\u03b8\n(AY + Y D)(1 + sec(\u03b8) + tan(\u03b8))\n3\u03c0 + 4\u03b8\n\u21d0\u21d2\n1 + sec(\u03b8) + tan(\u03b8)\n3\u03c0 + 4\u03b8\n\u21d0=\n2 + tan(\u03b8)\n8\n\u21d0\u21d2\n3\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0\n2(AY + Y D)\n3\u03c0\n<\n2\n3\u03c0\n<\n2\ntan(\u03b8)\n<\n\u03b8\n<\n\nTo verify this, it suffices to note that:\n8\ntan(\u03b8)\n<1\u2264\n3\u03c0\n\u03b8\nThus, the DNA Inequality is false for all L-Shapes.\nRemark. Even if one were to require that the DNA was not self-intersecting, one\ncould still construct a counterexample by moving the vertex of the curve that we\nconstructed above coinciding with Y , which occurs between P and Q, a tiny bit\ntowards X.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nOutline of the Proof of Theorem 1.2\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1.2 is quite involved, and in the course of proving it we\nestablish Theorem 1.3. We first set up some basic notation and then outline the\nproof of Theorem 1.2.\nTo prove the DNA Inequality for any curve, it suffices to prove it for closed\npolygonal lines. In this case, the integral of the absolute curvature reduces to a sum\nof the exterior angles at the vertices (where the exterior angles are measured so that\nthey are in the interval [0, \u03c0]). For an explanation of this reduction see [1], Section 2.\n(In particular, equation (2.3).)\nWe set our notation for polygonal curves. We write \u03b3 for the closed polygonal\n\"DNA.\" We denote the vertex sequence of \u03b3 by \u03b30 , \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n = \u03b30 , and the vertex\nsequence of \u0393 by \u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393m = \u03930 . When we refer to the number of vertices\nof some polygon, we shall mean the number of vertices with multiplicity, unless\notherwise stated. We consider indices modulo n (modulo m for \u0393), and assume that\nwe never have \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i+2 collinear. (Under this assumption, the exterior angles are\nin the interval (0, \u03c0].)\nDefinition 3.1. We define:\nf\u0393 (\u03b3) = \u03b1 * (curvature of \u03b3) \u2212 (perimeter of \u03b3)\nwhere 1/\u03b1 is the average curvature of \u0393.\nOf course, \u0393 satisfies the DNA Inequality means that f\u0393 (\u03b3) \u2265 0 for any closed\ncurve \u03b3 contained in \u0393.\nDefinition 3.2. We term a closed polygonal DNA \u03b3 contained within the cell \u0393\nwith f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0 a CX\u0393 -polygon. (As it is a \"counterexample\" to the DNA Inequality\nin \u0393.)\nDefinition 3.3. We write d(X, Y ) for the distance between X and Y , i.e. the length\nof the segment XY . The notation XY will usually refer to the line XY , and occasionally the ray or segment if explicitly stated.\n\nOutline of Proof of Theorem 1.2\nTheorem 1.2 (Theorem 8.1) states that the dented polygon described there is a\nDDNA-polygon if and only if the angle \u03b1 is small. For example, the isosceles triangle\nin Figure 2 is a DDNA-polygon with respect to its hypotenuse, but it is not a DDNApolygon with respect to its other sides.\n6\n\n\fHere is an overview of the proof of Theorem 8.1. A fundamental idea is that\nif \u0393 is a polygon that does not satisfy the DNA Inequality, then for any polygonal\nDNA \u03b3 providing a counterexample, we can \"simplify\" it (using Lemmas 4.1\u20135.2) to\nobtain a special counterexample. For DNA of this special type, the verification that\nthe DNA Inequality fails or holds is much easier.\nLemmas 4.1 and 4.2 clarify when we can assume that the vertices of a counterexample are on an edge of \u0393 or even coincide with a vertex of \u0393. If we could assume\nthat all of the vertices of any CX\u0393 -polygon are vertices of \u0393, then the proof would be\nrelatively easy. Since we cannot make this assumption, we identify (Definition 5.2)\nmanageable cells \u0393, which we call separable polygons, and a finite number of useful\npoints on the boundary of \u0393 that are not vertices. These points plus the vertices of\n\u0393 form the finite set C of critical points.\nThe technical Lemma 5.2 shows that we may assume that the vertices of our\nCX\u0393 -polygon are all in the finite set C or else our CX\u0393 -polygon has a special form\ninvolving vertices of \u0393 plus one or two other points on the boundary of \u0393. Thus\nLemma 5.2 identifies special types of counterexamples that any separable polygon\n\u0393, that does not satisfy the DNA Inequality, must contain. Similar to the proof of\nTheorem 5.1 from [1], we do this by removing \"jumps,\" i.e. adjacent pairs of vertices\nsuch that the line segment connecting them is not contained in the boundary of \u0393.\nSuch a line segment can intersect the boundary just at its endpoints, in which case it\nis termed a \"jump\". (Since we are trying to reduce to polygons having only critical\nvertices, we also require that at least one of the endpoints is not a critical point for it\nto be considered a jump.) However, since the cell can be non-convex, the interior of\nthe line segment can intersect the boundary, in which case we call it a \"leap\". The\nproof of Lemma 5.2 then proceeds by descent: given a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3, we construct\na CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 which either has a smaller jump number (this is the number of\njumps, with jumps such that neither endpoint is a critical point double-counted), or\nthe same jump number and fewer leaps. To complete the proof of Lemma 5.2, we\nagain employ the method of descent: we show that given a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 with no\njumps we can construct another CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 having no jumps and fewer vertices\nwhich are not critical points.\nThen, in Section 7 we turn to the problem of determining if the DNA Inequality\nholds for our special types of polygons. If the DNA Inequality does not hold for\narbitrarily small dents of P , then we have a sequence P\u03b4k of dented polygons, and\na sequence of counterexamples \u03b3 k , which we may assume to be of our special type.\nThe second fundamental idea is to observe that all of these counterexamples have\na bounded number of vertices, and the set of all polygons contained in P with a\nbounded number of vertices is compact; therefore, our sequence of counterexamples\n7\n\n\fhas a limiting point, say \u03b3. By studying which sequences can approach an equality\ncase of the DNA Inequality (in Lemma 7.1), we are able to show that infinitely many\nof the P\u03b4k contain counterexamples of a very special type (which are described in\nDefinition 7.2). Potential counterexamples of this type are so special that it is easy\nto specify an inequality that determines whether they are indeed counterexamples,\ni.e., whether f\u0393 < 0. From these inequalities, we employ an analytic argument (in\nSection 8) to deduce Theorem 8.1.\n\n4\n\nThree Useful Lemmas\n\nIn this section, we give some useful machinery that will apply in any cell \u0393.\nDefinition 4.1. We make the following important definitions concerning modifications to the DNA polygon.\n\u2022 If replacing \u03b3i with any other point on the line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i sufficiently close to \u03b3i\nyields a curve contained within \u0393, we say that \u03b3i is free to move along the line\n\u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i .\n\u2022 If \u03b3 is a closed curve such that, for all i, \u03b3i is not free to move along \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i or\n\u03b3i \u03b3i+1 , we say that \u03b3 is a 1-curve.\nLemma 4.1. If \u03b3 is a closed curve where there exists i such that \u03b3i is free to move\nalong line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , then one can always move \u03b3i one direction along \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , decreasing\nf\u0393 , until \u03b3i becomes collinear with \u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i+2 in that order, or is no longer free to\nmove. If \u03b3i is no longer free to move, then one of the following occurs:\n\u2022 \u03b3i reaches a vertex of \u0393;\n\u2022 \u03b3i reaches an edge of \u0393 such that \u03b3i\u22121 does not lie on the line containing that\nedge;\n\u2022 the line segment \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 intersects the boundary at a point other than \u03b3i+1 or \u03b3i .\nProof. First note that the bulleted items simply give a list of possibilities, such that\nit is necessary for one of them to hold if a vertex is no longer free to move. (Not all\nof them are sufficient.)\nWe distinguish 2 cases:\n\n8\n\n\f\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i+2\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\nFigure 4: Diagram for Case 1\nCase 1: \u03b3i\u22121 and \u03b3i+2 are on the same side of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 , as pictured in Figure 4.\nMoving \u03b3i along line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i in the direction that increases the distance to \u03b3i\u22121\nincreases the perimeter, but fixes the curvature, therefore decreasing f\u0393 .\nCase 2: They are on different sides, as pictured in Figure 5.\nLet H be the foot of the perpendicular from \u03b3i+1 to line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i . Define \u03b8 to be\nangle \u2220H\u03b3i+1\u03b3i .

To see this, observe that\nas \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0/2, we have f\u0393 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thus, as f\u0393\u2032 has at most one root on (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2),\nwe either have that f\u0393 is always decreasing, in which case we can move \u03b3i to the\nright, or that there exists \u03b2 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) such that f\u0393 is decreasing on (\u03b2, \u03c0/2),\nand increasing on (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03b2). In the latter case, we can move \u03b3i to the right if \u03b8 > \u03b2\nand to the left if \u03b8 < \u03b2.\nLemma 4.2. If \u03b3 is a CX\u0393 -polygon, then there is a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 which is a\n1-curve.\nProof. Assume there is some CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3. Consider S = {\u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 F\u0393 |l(\u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2264 l(\u03b3)},\nwhere F\u0393 is the set of all curves contained within \u0393, and l(\u03b3) is the number of vertices\nof \u03b3. S is a non-empty (it contains \u03b3) compact set, and f\u0393 is a lower semi-continuous\nfunction, so there is some \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 S with f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) minimal. Now, as f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2264 f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0,\n\u03b3 \u2032 is a CX\u0393 -polygon. But, if \u03b3 \u2032 were not a 1-curve, then by Lemma 4.1, there would\nexist a \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 with f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 ) < f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ), and this \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 would be in S because the proof of\nLemma 4.1 does not add any vertices, providing a contradiction.\nLemma 4.3. Write V\u03b3 for the set of vertices of \u03b3. If f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0 for some closed curve\n\u03b3 contained within \u0393, then there is a curve \u03b3 \u2032 which satisfies V\u03b3 \u2032 \u2286 V\u03b3 , f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) < 0,\nand has number of vertices less than or equal to |V\u03b3 |2 \u2212 |V\u03b3 |.\nProof. It suffices to show that for any closed curve \u03b3 with at least |V\u03b3 |2 \u2212 |V\u03b3 | + 1\nvertices, we can construct a curve \u03b3 \u2032 which satisfies V\u03b3 \u2032 \u2286 V\u03b3 , f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) < 0 and has\nfewer vertices than \u03b3.\nSuch a curve \u03b3 has at least |V\u03b3 |2 \u2212 |V\u03b3 | + 1 edges, counting multiplicity. But,\nthe number of edges without multiplicity is at most |V\u03b3 |2 \u2212 |V\u03b3 |, if we view our\nedges as directed. So by the pigeonhole principle there is some directed edge repeated by \u03b3, i.e. there exists i and j with i < j such that \u03b3i = \u03b3j , \u03b3i+1 = \u03b3j+1.\nNow, consider the two curves \u03b3 0 = \u03b30 , \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3i , \u03b3j+1, \u03b3j+2, . . . , \u03b3n = \u03b30 , and \u03b3 1 =\n\u03b3j , \u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i+2, . . . , \u03b3j\u22121, \u03b3j = \u03b3j , as pictured in Figure 6.\nWe have f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) = f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0, so either \u03b3 0 or \u03b3 1 must satisfy the requirements above for \u03b3 \u2032 .\n\n5\n\nSeparable Polygons\n\nThis long section provides a detailed study of possible CX\u0393 -polygons in a special\nclass of cells, which we term separable polygons. We begin with the definitions.\n10\n\n\f\u03b33\n\n\u03b32 = \u03b35\n\n\u03b31 = \u03b34\n\n\u03b30 = \u03b36\nFigure 6: Picture for i = 1, j = 4\nDefinition 5.1. A vertex of a cell \u0393 is called an interior vertex if it is contained in\nthe interior of the convex hull of \u0393.\nDefinition 5.2. A polygon \u0393 is called separable if for any point p in the interior of\nthe cell determined by \u0393, but not a vertex of \u0393, there is at most one interior vertex\nv of \u0393 such that the straight line determined by p and v intersects \u0393 in more than\ntwo points. Some examples of separable and non-separable polygons are given in\nFigure 7.\n\nSeparable Polygons\n\nNon-Separable Polygons\n\nFigure 7: Examples of Separable and Non-Separable Polygons\n\n11\n\n\fCorollary to Lemma 4.2. In a separable polygon \u0393, if we assume that we have a\nCX\u0393 -polygon, then we have a CX\u0393 -polygon, all of whose vertices lie on the boundary.\nProof. Any vertex in the interior of a separable polygon is free to move, along at\nleast one of the two possible lines. Therefore, by Lemma 4.2, we may assume that\nwe have a CX\u0393 -polygon, all of whose vertices lie on the boundary.\nDefinition 5.3. The set of critical points C is the set of all vertices of \u0393 plus any\npoint p in the interior of any edge of \u0393 which is collinear with two vertices of \u0393,\n(v, w), which are distinct from each other and the endpoints of the edge of \u0393 upon\nwhich p lies. Additionally, we require that the line segments connecting pv, pw are\ncontained within \u0393, and that p is not free to move along the line pv (equivalently pw,\nas p, v, w are collinear). Figure 8 gives an example of a non-convex pentagon with 9\ncritical points.\n\np\nv\nw\nFigure 8: Examples of Critical Points\nLemma 5.1. |C| \u2264 n2 .\nProof. Consider a non-vertex critical point p which is collinear with distinct vertices\nv, w. Since pv, pw are contained in \u0393, so is vw. It follows that p must be the furthest\npoint on the ray vw such that the line segment vp is contained within \u0393, or similarly\nfor ray wp. Thus, there are at most two non-vertex critical points for each set {v, w}\nof distinct vertices. So there are at most 2 * n(n \u2212 1)/2 non-vertex critical points, for\na total of n(n \u2212 1) + n = n2 critical points in all.\nRemark. One can show that, if the cell \u0393 is separable, |C| \u2264 2n \u2212 1. As we shall\nonly need that it is bounded by a polynomial function of n, we will leave the proof\nof this to an interested reader.\nDefinition 5.4. If \u0393 is separable, and \u03b3 is a 1-curve, then we have a way to split \u0393\ninto two pieces, which we shall refer to as cutting along segment \u03b3i\u22121\u03b3i . We say that\n12\n\n\ftwo point p and q, both in the interior of \u0393 but not on line segment \u03b3i\u22121\u03b3i , are on\nthe same piece of \u0393 if there is a (not necessarily closed) curve c contained within \u0393\nwith endpoints p and q such that c does not cross the segment \u03b3i \u03b3i\u22121 . We say that c\ncrosses the segment \u03b3i \u03b3i\u22121 if there are two (possibly identical) points x and y which\nlie in the segment and on c such that there are points x\u2032 and y \u2032 on c, arbitrarily close\nto x and y respectively, lying on opposite sides of the line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 . In Figure 9, two\nexamples of this construction are given; cutting along the bold line splits the region\ninto the shaded parts and the non-shaded parts.\nq\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\np\n\nFigure 9: Examples of Cutting Along \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i\nWe also define a point \u03b3i of the curve \u03b3 to be a \"turn-around\" if \u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i\u22122 lie\non opposite sides of \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , and when you cut along segment \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , separating \u0393\ninto two pieces, \u03b3i+1 and \u03b3i\u22122 lie on different pieces (these are not in general the\nsame thing, as \u0393 may be non-convex). Additionally, we require the same thing for\n\u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 with respect to \u03b3i \u03b3i+1. In Figure 10 is pictured a curve \u03b3 where \u03b3i is a\nturn-around.\n\u03b3i+2 \u03b3i \u03b3i\u22122\n\n\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\nFigure 10: A \"Turn-Around\"\nLemma 5.2. In any separable polygon \u0393 which contains a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3, there\nexists a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 having one of the following forms:\n13\n\n\f\u2022 \u03b3 \u2032 has all vertices in C;\n\u2022 \u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, \u0393j , \u0393j+1 , . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 , where i \u2264 j;\n\u2022 \u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, Y, \u0393j , \u0393j+1, . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 , where i < j;\nwhere the vertices of \u0393, in clockwise order, are \u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 , X is some point\non the boundary of cell \u0393, and Y is some point in the segment \u0393j\u22121 \u0393j such that the\nline segment XY intersects the boundary in more than two points. In either case,\nwe may assume that X is a turn-around.\nProof. We begin by assuming that there is some CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3, but there are no\nCX\u0393 -polygons in the forms\n\u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, \u0393j , \u0393j+1 , . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 or\n\u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, Y, \u0393j , \u0393j+1 , . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 ,\nwhere X is a turn-around, and prove that there is some CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 having\nvertices only in C.\nIn this proof, a \"jump\" is when we have \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 which are not both critical points\nsuch that the segment \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 intersects the boundary in exactly two points. A jump\nis called a \"bad jump\" if neither of the \u03b3i are critical points. We term the sum of the\nnumber of jumps and bad jumps (so bad jumps get counted twice) the jump number\nof \u03b3. Additionally, we term a \"leap\" when we have \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 such that \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is not\ncontained within the boundary of \u0393.\nClaim 5.2.1. Suppose we have a CX\u0393 -polygon (with at least one jump) that has\na leap \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 such that \u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 lie on the same side of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 or cutting along\n\u03b3i \u03b3i+1 leaves \u03b3i\u22121, \u03b3i+2 on the same piece of \u0393. Then, there exists another CX\u0393 polygon \u03b3 \u2032 which either has a smaller jump number, or less leaps and the same jump\nnumber.\nWe first do the case when \u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 lie on the same side of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 .\nLet \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 be a leap with \u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 on the same side of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 . We first\nexamine the case where \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is not a jump, as pictured in Figure 11. Observe that\nneither \u03b3i nor \u03b3i+1 may be an interior vertex, as \u0393 is separable.\nDefine the closed curve \u03b3 0 (pictured on the right) to be the curve which consists\nof following the boundary of \u0393, minus the portion between \u03b3i and \u03b3i+1 , and jumping\ninstead from \u03b3i \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i+1 . Also, define closed curve \u03b3 \u2032 (a portion of which is pictured\nto the left) to be the curve which consists of following \u03b3, minus \u03b3i \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i+1 , and\ninstead following the portion of the boundary which \u03b3 0 does not follow. Because of\n14\n\n\f\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3\u2032\n\n\u03b30\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i\n\nFigure 11: The case where \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is not a jump\nthe orientation of the angles at \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 (which must be similar to as pictured above\nas \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 are not interior vertices and \u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 lie on the same side of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 ),\nwe have f\u0393 (\u03b3) = f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ). (This equality uses f\u0393 (\u0393) = 0.) Because f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0,\neither f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) < 0 or f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) < 0. Now, both \u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 0 have a smaller or equal jump\nnumber than \u03b3 and fewer leaps (because our leap was not a jump), so we may take\none with a negative value of f\u0393 to be our CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 .\nWe now turn to the case where \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is a jump such that \u03b3i is not free to move\nalong line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i and \u03b3i+1 is not free to move along line \u03b3i+1 \u03b3i+2 , as pictured in\nFigure 12.\n\nv\n\nlv\n\nlw w\n\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\n\u03b3i+2\n\nFigure 12: First Figure where \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is a jump\nIf we cut along the line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 , this separates \u0393 into two pieces. On the side\nnot containing \u03b3i+2 , \u03b3i\u22121, through every interior vertex v of \u0393, we construct a line lv\nwhich passes through v but does not intersect the interior of the line segment \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 .\nNow, we form a new curve \u03b3 \u2032 by replacing \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 with the path that goes along the\nboundary and the lv , as pictured above. The resulting curve has the same curvature\n15\n\n\f(the orientation of the angles at \u03b3i is similar to as pictured above because \u03b3i is not\nfree to move along line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i ; similarly, the possible orientations of angles at \u03b3i+1\nare limited), but a greater perimeter, and thus a smaller (and hence negative) value\nof f\u0393 , while having one less jump, completing the proof of this case.\nNow, we consider the case when (without loss of generality) \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is a jump and\n\u03b3i is free to move along line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i . In this case, move it along the line until it is no\nlonger free to move; call the position that it reaches \u03b3i\u2032 . Because \u0393 is separable, line\n\u03b3i\u2032 \u03b3i+1 must intersect the boundary at only two points (the line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i\u2032 intersects it in\nmore than two). Thus, \u03b3i\u2032 must have reached the boundary. If \u03b3i+1 is free to move\n\u2032\nalong line \u03b3i+1 \u03b3i+2 , then we construct in a similar manner \u03b3i+1\n(otherwise, define\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b3i+1 = \u03b3i+1 ). Now, the curve formed by using \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 instead of \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 has the same\n\u2032\nnumber of jumps, one of which is \u03b3i\u2032 \u03b3i+1\n. But, by the previous case, we can create\na new curve without that jump. Thus, this completes the proof of the case when\n\u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 lie on the same side of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 .\nNext, we do the case when \u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i+2 lie on different sides of \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 , but cutting\nalong \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 leaves them on the same piece of \u0393, as pictured in Figure 13.\n\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\n\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i+2\n\n\u03b3i+2\n\u03b3\u2032\n\n\u03b30\n\nFigure 13: Second Figure where \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is a jump\nDefine the closed curve \u03b3 0 (pictured on the right) to be the curve which consists\nof following the boundary of \u0393, minus the portion between \u03b3i and \u03b3i+1 , and jumping\ninstead from \u03b3i \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i+1 , and define closed curve \u03b3 \u2032 (a portion of which is pictured\nto the left) to be the curve which consists of following \u03b3, minus \u03b3i \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i+1 , and\ninstead following the portion of the boundary which \u03b3 0 does not follow. Because of\nthe orientation of the angles at \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 (which must be similar to as pictured above),\nwe have f\u0393 (\u03b3) = f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ). Because f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0, either f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) < 0 or f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) < 0.\nIf f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) < 0, then we are done. Otherwise, as the point of \u03b3 0 which coincides with\n\u03b3i+1 is free to move, we can move it until it coincides with a critical point, forming a\ncurve with a negative value of f\u0393 with no jumps, completing the proof of this claim.\nClaim 5.2.2. We may construct a curve \u03b3 \u2032 with a jump number of 0, which is also\na CX\u0393 -polygon.\n16\n\n\fIt clearly suffices to show that given a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3, we can construct another\nCX\u0393 -polygon with a smaller jump number, or with the same jump number but\nhaving fewer leaps. Consider some jump \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 . Without loss of generality, let \u03b3i not\nbe a critical point. By applying claim 5.2.1, we may assume that for any j such that\n\u03b3j \u03b3j+1 is a leap, \u03b3j\u22121 and \u03b3j+2 do not lie on the same side of line \u03b3j \u03b3j+1 . We may\nfurther assume that for any j such that \u03b3j \u03b3j+1 is a leap, when we cut along segment\n\u03b3j \u03b3j+1, \u03b3j\u22121 and \u03b3j+2 are on different pieces.\nIf \u03b3i\u22121\u03b3i is not a leap, then \u03b3i\u22121 must be on the same edge of \u0393 as \u03b3i . By\nLemma 4.1, we can move \u03b3i along the line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , until one of the following occurs:\n\u2022 It reaches a vertex: In this case, \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 either is no longer a jump if \u03b3i\u22121 is a\ncritical point or no longer a bad jump otherwise; either way, the jump number\ndecreases.\n\u2022 The line segment \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 intersects the boundary at a point other than \u03b3i+1 :\nThus \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 is no longer a jump, decreasing the jump number.\n\u2022 \u03b3i becomes collinear with \u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i+2 in that order: This implies that we drop\n\u03b3i+1 , and \u03b3i \u03b3i+2 is not a jump, because it intersects the boundary of \u0393 in a\nthird point (the previous location of \u03b3i+1 ).\nThus, we may assume that \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i is also a leap. From our earlier discussion about\nleaps, we may assume that \u03b3i+2 and \u03b3i\u22121 lie on opposite sides of line \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 , and that\n\u03b3i\u22122 and \u03b3i+1 lie on opposite sides of line \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i , which is pictured in Figure 14.\n\n\u03b3\u2032\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\n\u03b30\n\u03b3i\u22121\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i+1\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i+1\nFigure 14: Figure for Claim 5.2.2\n\nIn this case, define the closed curve \u03b3 0 (pictured on the right) to be the curve\nwhich consists of following the boundary of \u0393, minus the portion between \u03b3i\u22121 and\n17\n\n\f\u03b3i+1 (the portion not containing \u03b3i ), and jumping instead from \u03b3i\u22121 \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i+1 ,\nand define closed curve \u03b3 \u2032 (a portion of which is pictured to the left) to be the curve\nwhich consists of following \u03b3, minus \u03b3i\u22121 \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i \u2212\u2192 \u03b3i+1 , and instead following\nthe portion of the boundary which \u03b3 0 does not follow. As \u03b3i\u00b12 , \u03b3i\u22131 lie on opposite\nsides of \u03b3i \u03b3i\u00b11 and end up on different pieces when we cut along segments \u03b3i \u03b3i\u00b11 , the\nangles must be oriented in a similar fashion to the ones in the above diagram, and\nwe thus have f\u0393 (\u03b3) = f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ). Now, consider moving the vertices of \u03b3 0 that\ncoincide with \u03b3i\u00b11 (not along the line connecting them to \u03b3i , but along the other\nof two possible lines), until they become collinear with \u03b3i , or until each one reaches\nvertices of \u0393 or the line segment joining that point to \u03b3i is not a jump, constructing\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\na curve \u03b3 0 . By Lemma 4.1, f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) \u2265 f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ). Now, if f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) \u2265 0, this implies\n\u2032\nf\u0393 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) < 0. But, \u03b3 \u2032 has two less jumps than \u03b3. On the other hand if f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) < 0,\n\u2032\nthen if the point coinciding with \u03b3i\u00b11 became collinear with \u03b3i , the curve \u03b3 0 has no\njumps and has a negative value of f\u0393 , completing the proof of this claim. Otherwise,\nby assumption (see first paragraph of the proof), one of the following holds:\n\u2032\n\n\u2022 \u03b3i is not a turn-around in \u03b3 0 : Therefore, we may apply claim 5.2.1 to the curve\n\u2032\n\u03b3 0 to produce a curve which either has a smaller jump number or an identical\n\u2032\njump number but fewer leaps than \u03b3 0 .\n\u2032\n\n\u2022 If we write \u03b3 0 = \u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, \u0393j , \u0393j+1, . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 , we have i > j:\n\u2032\nIt is clear that f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) = f\u0393 (X, \u0393j , \u0393j+1, . . . , \u0393i , X).

Given a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 with a jump number of 0, we may construct\nanother CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 which consists of vertices only in C.\nIt clearly suffices to show that given such a CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3, we can construct\nanother CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3 \u2032 with less vertices not in C, which also has a jump number\nof 0. I first claim that we may assume that no vertex not in C is free to move. For if\nany are free to move, then we may move them until that is no longer the case, and we\nwill not increase the number of vertices in C. It is clear that this operation cannot\n18\n\n\fincrease the jump number. Now, take some \u03b3i \u2208\n/ C. As it is not free to move, we\nhave without loss of generality, \u03b3i , X, \u03b3i+1 collinear in that order, for some interior\nvertex X of \u0393. Of course, we cannot have \u03b3i+1 a critical point either, as that would\nimply \u03b3i is a vertex.\nCase 1: \u03b3i+2 6= \u03b3i and \u03b3i+1 6= \u03b3i\u22121 . It follows that \u03b3i+2, \u03b3i+1 lie on the same edge\nof \u0393, as do \u03b3i , \u03b3i\u22121 .

For \u03b8 in the interval specified\nabove, the curvature is clearly linear, so it suffices to show that the perimeter function is concave up. Now, the perimeter of \u03b3 is a constant plus the sum of lengths\nd(\u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i ) + d(\u03b3i , X) + d(X, \u03b3i+1 ) + d(\u03b3i+1, \u03b3i+2 ). Thus, by symmetry, it suffices to\nshow that d(\u03b3i\u22121, \u03b3i ) + d(\u03b3i , X) is a concave-up function of \u03b8. This clearly does not\ndepend on the choice of our fixed line, so we let our fixed line be the perpendicular\n19\n\n\ffrom X to the edge of \u0393 upon which \u03b3i , \u03b3i\u22121 lie. Then, for \u03b8 in the above domain, depending upon orientation, d(\u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i ) + d(\u03b3i , X) is given up to a constant by:\na(sec \u03b8 \u00b1 tan \u03b8), where a is the length of the perpendicular from X to that side. The\ncos \u03b8\nsecond derivative of that expression is given by (1\u2213sin\n> 0 for \u03b8 in that domain,\n\u03b8)2\nsince that domain is always contained in (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Thus, f\u0393 is a concave-down\nfunction in that domain, so the minimum of f\u0393 as we roll our line around X occurs\nat the end points of the domain. If we replace \u03b3 by the curve that uses this minimum\ninstead, we have not increased the number of vertices which are not in C, nor have\nwe increased the jump number, and we have decreased the number of \u03b3i which fall\nunder this case. Thus, if there is some \u03b3i \u2208\n/ C, we may assume that \u03b3i+2 = \u03b3i or\n\u03b3i+1 = \u03b3i\u22121 .\nCase 2: \u03b3i+1 = \u03b3i\u22121, but we have \u03b3i 6= both \u03b3i\u00b12 , from which it follows that \u03b3i+2\nlies on the same edge as \u03b3i+1 , and \u03b3i\u22122 lies on the same edge as \u03b3i\u22121 , as pictured in\nFigure 17.\nX\n\u03b3i\n\nX\n\n\u03b3i\u00b11\n\u03b3i\n\nX\n\n\u03b3i\u00b11\n\n\u03b3i\u00b11\n\n\u03b3i\n\nFigure 17: Figure for Case 2 (of Claim 5.2.3)\nIn this case, consider rolling the lines \u03b3i \u03b3i+1 and \u03b3i\u22121 \u03b3i around X together, so\nthat we keep \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b3i+1 . Similar to the previous case, we will show that f\u0393 is\nconcave down (in the appropriate interval). Again, the curvature is linear, so it\nsuffices to show that the perimeter is concave up. The perimeter, up to an additive\nconstant, is given by 2d(\u03b3i , X) + d(X, \u03b3i+1) + d(\u03b3i+1, \u03b3i+2 ) + d(\u03b3i\u22121, X) + d(\u03b3i\u22122, \u03b3i\u22121 ).\nThe calculation in Case 1 showed that d(X, \u03b3i+1 ) + d(\u03b3i+1 , \u03b3i+2) and d(\u03b3i\u22121, X) +\nd(\u03b3i\u22122 , \u03b3i\u22121) are concave up, so it suffices to show that d(\u03b3i , X) is a concave-up\nfunction of \u03b8. Again, choosing our fixed line to be from X to the edge of \u0393 upon\nwhich \u03b3i lies, we see that our function is given, up to a constant, by a sec \u03b8, which is\nconcave up in (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Thus, the minimum of f\u0393 , as we roll our line around X,\noccurs at the end points of the domain. As in the previous case, we may assume that\nthere is some \u03b3i which does not fall under this case or the previous one, provided\nthat, after this reduction and the previous one, we still have some \u03b3i \u2208\n/ C.\n\n20\n\n\fCase 3: \u03b3i+1 = \u03b3i\u22121 , and \u03b3i = \u03b3i+2 or \u03b3i\u22122 . Without loss of generality, say that\n\u03b3i = \u03b3i+2 . Now, define the curves\n\u03b3 0 := \u03b30 , \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3i\u22121, \u03b3i+2 , . . . \u03b3n = \u03b30\n\u03b3 1 := \u03b3i\u22121 , \u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 = \u03b3i\u22121 .\nWe have f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) = f\u0393 (\u03b3) < 0. Now, consider rotating \u03b3 1 around X until\n\u2032\none of its vertices becomes equal to a vertex of \u0393, producing a new curve \u03b3 1 . In\norder to prove that we can do this to decrease f\u0393 , it suffices to show that, in terms of\nthe angle, f\u0393 is concave down. As the curvature is constant, it suffices to show that\nthe perimeter is concave up. As the perimeter is given by 2(d(\u03b3i , X) + d(\u03b3i+1 , X)),\nwe have already seen in Case 2 that this is concave up. Thus, we can construct a\n\u2032\ncurve \u03b3 1 that has all vertices in C, and a \u03b3 0 that has fewer vertices not in C than\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b3, such that f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) < 0, f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) \u2264 f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ). This gives f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) \u2264\n\u2032\nf\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) + f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) < 0. Thus, either f\u0393 (\u03b3 1 ) < 0 or f\u0393 (\u03b3 0 ) < 0; either way, we have\nconstructed another curve with fewer vertices \u2208\n/ C which is also a CX\u0393 -polygon.\nThis completes the proof of this case, hence of this claim, and hence of this\nLemma.\nCorollary 5.1. If a cell \u0393 is a separable polygon, then \u0393 satisfies the DNA Inequality\nif and only if the inequality holds when the DNA has |C|2 \u2212 |C| or fewer vertices.\nProof. Apply Lemmas 4.3 and 5.2; note that n + 2 \u2264 |C|2 \u2212 |C|.\n\n6\n\nProof of Theorem 1.3\n\nHere, we provide some estimates for the complexity of determining if a given polygon\nsatisfies the DNA Inequality. For the proof of this theorem, we adopt a simplified\nmodel of computation, described below in Definition 6.1.\nDefinition 6.1. The following operations count as elementary operations:\n\u2022 Computing the sum, product, difference, or quotient of any two numbers.\n\u2022 Computing any trigonometric functions of any number.\n\u2022 Comparing two numbers (i.e. testing which one is larger).\n\u2022 Computing the roots of a polynomial equation, given its coefficients (if the\ndegree of the polynomial is bounded).\n21\n\n\fTheorem 6.1. There exists an algorithm which when given as input a separable\npolygon \u0393 specified by its n vertices, determines whether or not \u0393 satisfies the DNA\ninequality, in number of elementary operations polynomial in n.\nProof. By Lemma 5.2, to determine whether \u0393 satisfies the DNA Inequality, it suffices\nto examine curves with |C|2 \u2212 |C| or fewer vertices, all in C, as well as the curves\n\u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, \u0393j , \u0393j+1, . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 and\n\u03930 , \u03931 , . . . , \u0393i\u22121 , \u0393i , X, Y, \u0393j , \u0393j+1, . . . , \u0393n = \u03930 .\n\n(1)\n\nFor these curves, there are a finite number of ways to choose i, j, the edges upon\nwhich X (and Y if we are in the latter case) lie, and, if we are in the latter case,\nthe interior vertex which line XY passes through. For each combination, f\u0393 as a\nfunction of the position of X can be differentiated, and the curves can be considered\nfor each zero of the derivative and at the end points. For the curves in the form (1)\nthere are O(n) ways to choose each of i, j, the edges upon which X (and possibly Y\nas well) lie, and the interior vertex on line XY (if we are in the second case). As\ncomputing the zeros of the derivative1 and the average curvature is linear time in\nn, this part gives contribution O(n6 ) to the run time for examining the second case,\nand O(n4 ) for examining the first case.\nThus, it suffices to show that one can check the curves with |C|2 \u2212 |C| or fewer\nvertices, all in C in time O(n12 log n). By Lemma 5.1, we have |C| = O(n2 ). Define\nS to the set of ordered pairs of critical points such that the segment connecting\nthem lies within \u0393. Define the functions f k : S 2 \u2192 R of (e1 , e2 ) to be the minimal\npossible value of the function f\u0393 over all (possibly open) polygonal paths with at\nmost k + 2 vertices, whose first edge is e1 and whose last edge is e2 (if there are no\nsuch polygonal paths, we assign value \u221e). Now, we can precompute a table of values\nfor f k for any k.\nSuppose we want to find the minimal value that is assumed by all closed curves\nwith |C|2 \u2212 |C| or fewer vertices. If we assume that the curve has three consecutive\nvertices v1 , v2 , v3 , then the minimal value of f\u0393 for such a curve is\nf |C|\n\n2 \u2212|C|\u22121\n\n(v2 v1 , v3 v2 ) + \u03b1(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2220v1 v2 v3 ),\n\nwhere 1/\u03b1 is the average curvature of \u0393 (as in Definition 3.1). Thus, the DNA\nInequality holds in \u0393 if and only if\nf |C|\n\n2 \u2212|C|\u22121\n\n(v2 v1 , v3 v2 ) + \u03b1(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2220v1 v2 v3 ) > 0\n\n1\n\nTo do this, we need only to compute sums, differences, products, quotients, trigonometric\nfunctions, and solve polynomials of bounded degree.\n\n22\n\n\ffor any v1 , v2 , v3 such that v1 v2 , v2 v3 \u2208 S. So, if we have precomputed a table of\n2\nvalues of f |C| \u2212|C|\u22121 , we can see in time O(n3 ) whether the DNA Inequality holds\n2\nin \u0393. So, it suffices to show that we can compute the value of f |C| \u2212|C|\u22121 in time\nO(n12 log n). I claim that if we have a precomputed table of values for f k1 and f k2 ,\nwe can easily compute values of f k1 +k2 , and can of course use this to precompute a\ntable of values for f k1 +k2 .\nSay we wish to compute f k1 +k2 (e1 , e2 ). Consider the curve with a first edge of\ne1 and last edge of e2 , with k1 + k2 + 2 or fewer vertices, which has the minimal\nvalue of f\u0393 . If we consider an edge e with at most k1 \u2212 2 vertices separating it\nfrom e1 and at most k2 \u2212 2 vertices separating it from e2 (this clearly exists as\nour curve has k1 + k2 + 2 or fewer vertices), then we have that the value of f\u0393\nof the entire curve is the same as the sum of f\u0393 on the piece from e1 \u2192 e plus\nthe value on the piece from e \u2192 e2 , minus the length of e. Thus, we have that\nf k1 +k2 (e1 , e2 ) = mine\u2208S (f k1 (e1 , e) + f k2 (e, e2 ) \u2212 |e|). As |S 3 | = O(|C|6) = O(n12 ), we\nhave that to precompute a table of values for f k1 +k2 from a table of values for f k1\nand f k2 takes time O(n12 ). Using the double-and-add algorithm, we can compute\n2\nthe table of values for f |C| \u2212|C|\u22121 in time O(n12 log(|C|2 \u2212 |C| \u2212 e)) = O(n12 log n),\ni.e. in polynomial time.\nRemark. The above run-time analysis is quite pessimistic. By an earlier remark, we\nactually have |C| = O(n), so the above run-time analysis can be improved to give\nO(n6 log n). We will leave the verification of this claim to an interested reader.\n\n7\n\nSequences of Polygons\n\nDefinition 7.1. A polygon \u0393 with a convex hull of P is called simply dented if, for\nany two consecutive vertices of \u0393, at least one is a vertex of P , and for every two\nconsecutive edges of P , at least one is an edge of \u0393. Figure 18 shows some examples\nof both simply dented and non simply dented polygons.\nFix some convex polygon P . Denote the set of points contained within P by\nS. Assume that all polygonal curves of interest are contained within P , and have\nM or fewer vertices. For every v = (v0 , v1 , . . . , vM \u22121 ) \u2208 S M , let \u03b3[v] be the closed\ncurve v0 v1 * * * vM = v0 . Then, any polygonal curve of interest is in the form \u03b3[v] for\nsome v \u2208 S M . Note that the \"pseudo-vertices\" vi need not be real vertices of the\ncurve \u03b3[v], as vi\u22121 , vi , vi+1 might be collinear in that order for some i. Moreover,\nconsecutive vi 's might be equal. Clearly, S M is a compact space. It can be shown\nthat:\n23\n\n\fNon-Simply Dented Polygons\n\nSimply Dented Polygons\n\nFigure 18: Examples of Simply and Non-Simply Dented Polygons\n\u2022 v \u2192 perimeter(\u03b3[v]) is continuous on S M .\n\u2022 v \u2192 curvature(\u03b3[v]) is lower semicontinuous on S M .\nNow, consider what happens when we have a sequence of simply dented polygons\nP 1 , P 2, P 3 . . ., with a common convex hull P . Notice that there is some M (twice\nthe number of vertices of P will do) such that each P k may be presented as \u03b3[Vk ]\nfor V \u2208 S M , since at least every other vertex of the P k is a vertex of P .\nConsider a vertex v of P k which is also a vertex of P ; it is an endpoint of two\nedges of P . At most one of those edges of P is not an edge of P k . If there is such\nan edge, we denote by v \u2032 the other endpoint of that edge. If Q is the vertex of P k\nbetween v and v \u2032 , then we can form a non-vertex critical point by intersecting Qv\nwith the boundary. We term this the critical point corresponding to v. In Figure 19\nis pictured the critical point corresponding to v \u2032 (denoted p in the diagram).\nIt is clear that when k is sufficiently large, these are all of the non-vertex critical\npoints of P k .\nDefinition 7.2. We define the curve \u03b3 k,v to be the curve which is obtained by starting\nwith the curve P k and replacing the vertex v with the critical point corresponding\nto v \u2032 , as pictured in Figure 19.\nThe next lemma essentially tells us that the DNA Inequality is true for arbitrarily\nsmall dents of a region if it is true for these special kinds of curves \u03b3 k,v .\n24\n\n\fv\n\nv\u2032\nQ\np\n\nFigure 19: Critical Point Corresponding to v \u2032\nLemma 7.1. Assume that we have a sequence of polygons P 1 , P 2, P 3 . . . such that:\n\u2022 Each of the P k is simply dented;\n\u2022 None of the P k satisfy the DNA Inequality;\n\u2022 The P k have a common convex hull P ;\n\u2022 For some M, there is a presentation Vk \u2208 S M of each P k so that limk\u2192\u221e Vk\nexists in S M , and for which \u03b3[limk\u2192\u221e Vk ] = P ;\n\u2022 There exists \u01eb > 0, which does not depend upon k, such that any two vertices\nof P k are at least \u01eb apart for all k.\nThen, it follows that there is an infinite subsequence of our sequence in which there\nis a CXP k -polygon of the form \u03b3 k,v , for some v which is both a vertex of P (and of\ncourse consequently a vertex of P k ), and is the endpoint of exactly one edge of P\nwhich is not also an edge of P k (for k in our subsequence).\nProof. For k sufficiently large, every critical point is either a vertex or a critical point\ncorresponding to the endpoints of some edge of the convex hull not contained in P k ,\nsince every two vertices of the P k are at least \u01eb apart, and all of the P k are simply\ndented. Thus, we will throw out the beginning of our sequence so that this is true for\nall k. For each P k , we consider the set of edges of P not contained in P k . As there\nare finitely many possibilities for this, there is an infinite subsequence such that the\nset is the same for any element of the subsequence.\nThus it suffices to prove this lemma in the case where the set of edges of P\nnot contained in P k does not depend on k. We denote these edges by Prl Prl +1 for\n25\n\n\fl = 1, 2, . . . , \u03c3. Now, for sufficiently large k, P k is separable (because every two\nvertices of the P k are at least \u01eb apart), so we also assume that each P k is separable.\nThen the vertex sequence of each P k is the same as the vertex sequence for P except\nthat each edge Prl Prl +1 is replaced by Prl Qkl Prl +1 for some Qkl in the interior of\nP . Now, if we consider the elements (Qk1 , Qk2 , . . . , Qk\u03c3 ) \u2208 S \u03c3 , and observe that S \u03c3\nis compact, it follows that we may select a subsequence in which (Qk1 , Qk2 , . . . , Qk\u03c3 )\nconverges in S \u03c3 ; in other words, we may select a subsequence such that Qkl has a\nlimit for each l.\nWrite n for the number of vertices of P . To each P k , there is a CX\u0393 -polygon\n\u03b3 k . By the machinery of the previous section, we may assume that \u03b3 k (as well as\nP k ) have the number of vertices bounded by some function depending only upon\nn, which we shall refer to as M. By the remarks at the beginning of the section,\neach of the \u03b3 k can be presented as \u03b3[vk ] for some vk \u2208 S M . (Recall that we also\nnotate P k as \u03b3[Vk ].) As S M is compact, there is a convergent subsequence of the vk ,\nwhich converges to v. Let AC represent average curvature, viewed as a function from\nS M \u2192 R. Since this is the product of a lower semicontinuous function, curvature,\nand a continuous function, reciprocal of perimeter, it's lower semicontinuous. Now,\nsince any two vertices of P k are at least \u01eb apart, it follows that AC(Vk ) converges to\nAC(P ). Each CX\u0393 -polygon \u03b3[vk ] satisfies AC(vk ) < AC(Vk ). Since vk \u2192 v, and\nsince AC is lower semicontinuous, AC(v) \u2264 lim sup AC(vk ). Therefore:\nAC(v) \u2264 lim sup AC(vk ) \u2264 lim sup AC(Vk ) = AC(P ).\nSince P is convex, the Lagarias-Richardson theorem [1] tells us that AC(v) \u2265 AC(P ),\nso AC(v) = AC(P ). In [2], it is proven that for any convex curve P , the only equality\ncases to the DNA Inequality are multiple circuits of P . Therefore, \u03b3[v] is a multiple\ncircuit of P . We consider two cases:\nCase 1: Our convergent subsequence contains infinitely many closed curves whose\nvertex sequences contain non-critical points. By Lemma 5.2, we may assume that\nthese have the form:\nk\nk\nP0k , P1k , . . . , Pi\u22121\n, Pik , X k , Pjk , Pj+1\n, . . . , Pmk = P0k\n\n(which we will refer to as the first case) or\nk\nk\nP0k , P1k , . . . , Pi\u22121\n, Pik , X k , Y k , Pjk , Pj+1\n, . . . , Pmk = P0k\n\n(which we will refer to as the second case). From our convergent subsequence, as\nthere are finitely many choices for i, and j, we may select a subsequence with i and\nj constant.\n26\n\n\fNow, I claim that the perimeter of \u03b3 k in this case is at most the perimeter of P\nplus twice the length of Pik X k . This follows from the triangle inequality: the length\nof X k Pjk (respectively X k Y k ) is less than or equal to the length of Pik X k , plus the\nlength of the portion of the boundary between Pik and Pjk (respectively Pik and Y k ).\n(Note that this argument relies on i \u2264 j in the first case or i < j in the second case\nto talk about the portion of the boundary between Pik and Pjk or Pik and Yjk .) From\nthis, it follows that the perimeter of \u03b3[v] is at most the perimeter of P plus twice\nthe diameter of P . Since twice the diameter of P is strictly less than the perimeter\nof P , the perimeter of \u03b3[v] is strictly less than twice the perimeter of P . As \u03b3[v] is a\nmultiple circuit of P , it follows that \u03b3[v] is a single circuit of P . Since the perimeter\nof \u03b3[v] is the same as the perimeter of P , we have:\nlim (perimeter of \u03b3 k ) = perimeter of P = lim (perimeter of P k )\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n=\u21d2 lim (curvature of \u03b3 k ) = lim (curvature of P k ) = 2\u03c0\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(2)\n\nIf i = j, elementary geometry shows that the (unsigned) curvature of \u03b3 k is greater\nthan 4\u03c0. Thus, we may assume that i < j. As X k is a turn-around, X k does not\nlie in the portion of P k between Pik and Pjk (or Pik and Y k in the second case).\nTherefore, the only way for \u03b3[v] to be a single circuit is for the length d(X k , Pik ) \u2192 0\nor d(X k , Pjk ) \u2192 0. (This should be replaced by d(X k , Pik ) \u2192 0 or d(X k , Y k ) \u2192 0 in\nthe second case.) If we are in the second case, segment X k Y k intersects the boundary\nof P k in a third point, say Qkl . Thus, limk\u2192\u221e (d(X k , Y k )) = d(Prl , Prl +1 ). From this\nwe conclude that X k cannot approach Y k . In other words, we may assume without\nloss of generality that d(X k , Pik ) \u2192 0, which implies that for k sufficiently large, we\nk\nk\nhave X k in either Pi\u22121\nPik or Pik Pi+1\n. If we are in the second case, from elementary\ngeometry it is clear that if j = i + 1 and X k is between Y k and Pjk that we have\nthe total curvature of \u03b3 k is greater than 4\u03c0. Thus, by (2), we may assume that this\ndoes not happen. In either case, as X k does not lie in the portion of P k between\nPik and Pjk (or Pik and Y k in the second case), we have that X k lies in the interval\nk\nPi\u22121\nPik for k sufficiently large. It follows that \u03b3 k has an angle with measure \u03c0. (This\noccurs at Pik .) As the limit of the total curvature of \u03b3 k is 2\u03c0, the limit of the sum of\ncontributions to the total curvature of every other angle is also \u03c0. It follows that \u03b3 k\ntends to some (degenerate) curve with two vertices, which is not a multiple circuit\nof P . Therefore, this case cannot happen.\nCase 2: All but finitely many of the curves of our subsequence consist only of\ncritical points. Throw out the beginning of our subsequence so that all of the curves\nin the subsequence consist only of critical points. Observe that the critical point\n27\n\n\fcorresponding to a vertex v of P (which of course is also a vertex of the P k ) tends to\nv \u2032 as k tends to \u221e. As \u03b3[v] is a multiple circuit of P , it follows that for k sufficiently\nlarge in our subsequence, the vertices of the curve \u03b3 k are, in order, (possibly for\nmultiple circuits) exactly one of the (at most two; one of them is v) critical points\nwhich becomes close to each vertex v, and possibly visiting the Qkl between Prkl and\nPrkl +1 . For each vertex v which is the endpoint of an edge of P which is not an edge of\nthe P k in our subsequence, write nk,v for the number of vertices of \u03b3 k which are equal\nto the critical point corresponding to v \u2032 . If for some i, \u03b3ik is equal to the critical point\nk\nk\ncorresponding to v \u2032 , then I claim we may assume v \u2032 \u2208 {\u03b3i+1\n, \u03b3i\u22121\n}. For, if this is not\nthe case, then we may replace \u03b3i with v. This increases the perimeter and leaves the\ncurvature unchanged, thus decreasing average curvature. Therefore, we may assume\nk\nthat when \u03b3ik equals any non-vertex critical point, then one of \u03b3i\u00b11\nis the vertex of\ncircuit of\nP to which the critical point corresponds. Suppose that\nP\u03b3[v] is a multiple\nP which goes around m times. I claim that fP k (\u03b3 k ) =\nnk,v fP k (\u03b3 k,v ), and this will\ncomplete the proof since, as fP k (\u03b3 k ) < 0, it would follow that one of the fP k (\u03b3 k,v ) is\nnegative, for each k in our subsequence that is sufficiently large. To see the equality,\nlook at the two collections of curves:\n\u2022 nk,v copies of \u03b3 k,v for each k and m copies of P k .\nP\n\u2022\nnk,v copies of P k and one copy of \u03b3 k .\n\nThe sums over each collection of perimeter and of curvature are equal, i.e., for each\ncurve, compute the curvature and perimeter, then add those values up. To see that\nthe sums of the curvatures are equal, look at the curvature contributions of the two\ncollections at all the possible vertices of the curves, and recall that when \u03b3ik equals\nk\nany non-vertex critical point, then one of \u03b3i\u00b11\nis the vertex of P to which the critical\npoint corresponds. Similarly for the perimeters, look at all possible edges of the\ncurves. By our earlier comment, this completes the proof of this case, and of this\nlemma.\nRemark. If there is some way of verifying that the curves \u03b3 k,v are not CX\u0393 -polygons\nfor large k, then the number of cases which must be analyzed to directly apply this\nlemma in order to prove that the DNA Inequality holds in \u0393 is linear in the number of\ninterior vertices of P , which is significantly less than the number of cases to directly\napply Theorem 6.1.\n\n8\n\nClassification of DNA-Polygons\n\nHere we prove our main result, Theorem 1.2 (Theorem 8.1).\n28\n\n\fTheorem 8.1. If P is a convex polygon with perimeter p and we are denting an edge\nwith length l, and \u03b1 is the larger of the two angles that the edge makes with the two\nadjacent edges, then P is a DDNA-polygon (with respect to this edge) if and only if:\n1 + cos \u03b1\n.\nsin \u03b1\nRemark. The set of convex polygons constructed in Theorem 8.1 is non-empty,\nas stated in the introduction. For example, it is easy to see that it contains an\nisosceles right triangle (dented along the hypotenuse). Of course, this proof is nonconstructive, in the sense that it does not tell by what angle you may dent a single\nedge. However, by Theorem 6.1, we can compute what dents will work for any specific curve. For example, for the isosceles right triangle, we can find that for this case\nit holds as long as \u03b4 is less than or equal to the root of\n4\u03c0 + 6\u03b4\n2\u03c0 + 4\u03b4\n\u221a\n\u221a\n=\n2 + 2 sec(\u03b4)\n4 \u2212 2 tan(\u03c0/4 \u2212 \u03b4) + 2 sec(\u03c0/4 \u2212 \u03b4) + 2 sec(\u03b4)\n2p \u2264 \u03c0l\n\nwhich is approximately 0.297142593 radians.\nThe following corollary gives a more verifiable way of testing if a given convex\npolygon is a DDNA-polygon.\n\nCorollary 8.2. Let P be a convex polygon with a fixed edge and \u03b1 be the larger\nof the two angles that the fixed edge makes with the two adjacent edges.

Recall Definition 1.1 and the notation there. Then P is not a DDNA-polygon\nif and only if there exists a sequence \u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u03b43 , . . . with a limit of 0 such that there\nis a CXP\u03b4k -polygon for each \u03b4k . Denote the edge that we are denting by AB. By\nLemma 7.1, we have that this happens if and only if, for \u03b4 arbitrarily small, one of\nthe curves \u03b3 k,A , \u03b3 k,B (which are pictured in Figure 20) is a CXP\u03b4k -polygon.\nA\n\nA\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b4\n\nl\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b3 k,A\n\n\u03b3 k,B\n\nB\n\nl\n\u03b2\n\nB\n\nFigure 20: The Curves \u03b3 k,A and \u03b3 k,B\nIf we write l for the length AB, and \u03b1, \u03b2 for the angles at A, B in P , then\nfP k (\u03b3 k,A ) < 0 if and only if:\n2\u03c0\np+\n\nsin(\u03b1)\nl sin(\u03b1+\u03b4)\n\n\u2212l\u2212\n\nsin(\u03b4)\nl sin(\u03b1+\u03b4)\n\n<\n\n2\u03c0 + 4\u03b4\n,\np + l(sec(\u03b4) \u2212 1)\n\nwhere p is the perimeter of P . Similarly, fP k (\u03b3 k,B ) < 0 if and only if the above is\ntrue with \u03b1 replaced by \u03b2. Therefore, the DNA Inequality holds for arbitrarily small\ndents if and only if, for \u03b4 arbitrarily small, we have:\n2\u03c0\np+\n\nsin(\u03b1)\nl sin(\u03b1+\u03b4)\n\n\u2212l\u2212\n\nsin(\u03b4)\nl sin(\u03b1+\u03b4)\n\n\u2265\n\n2\u03c0 + 4\u03b4\np + l(sec(\u03b4) \u2212 1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 assumes either angle.

From here on, we assume this.\nI claim that in the equality case, the DNA Inequality holds. As LHS(0) =\nRHS(0) and LHS \u2032 (0) = RHS \u2032 (0), it suffices to examine the second derivative.\n\u03b1\n.

However, as noted in Section 1, the methods of this paper can still be\napplied if the triangle is not isosceles, or even if there are multiple dents all depending\non one parameter \u03b4, so long as adjacent sides are not dented and there exists \u01eb > 0,\nwhich does not depend on \u03b4, such that any two vertices of P\u03b4 are at least \u01eb apart.\nEssentially, so long as a sequence of counterexamples P\u03b4k would meet the criteria\nof Lemma 7.1, we can analyze the DNA Inequality in P\u03b4 using the methods of this\npaper.\nIt is reasonable to conjecture that Theorem 8.1 holds in cases where the curve is\nnot polygonal, even though the techniques of this paper can probably not be used to\nprove it. More precisely, let P be a piecewise-smooth convex curve, with at least one\nof the pieces straight (call this piece AB). Write p for the arc length of P , and \u03b1 for\nthe larger of the two angles that AB makes with the other one-sided tangent vector\nto A and B. (For example, if P is smooth, \u03b1 = \u03c0. If P is a semicircle and AB is\nthe diameter, then \u03b1 = \u03c0/2.) Then, based on Theorem 8.1, we conjecture that the\nDNA inequality holds for arbitrarily small dents of P along side AB if and only if\n2p \u2264 \u03c0l\n\n1 + cos \u03b1\n,\nsin \u03b1\n\nwhere l is the length of AB.\nIn particular, if true, this conjecture would imply that the DNA Inequality fails\nfor arbitrarily small dents of smooth convex curves. (An example is pictured in\nFigure 21.) While the above conjecture is probably quite difficult to prove, this\ncorollary for arbitrarily small dents of smooth convex curves is probably not too\ndifficult to prove: the correct curve to take for the counterexample DNA should be\nanalogous to the \u03b3 k,A used in the proof of Theorem 8.1.\n\nFigure 21: A Dent in a Smooth Curve\n\n32\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.
