Nielsen1, \u2217\n1\n\nSchool of Physical Sciences and School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering,\nThe University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia\n(Dated: October 31, 2018)\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0402005v1 2 Feb 2004\n\nWe propose an approach to optical quantum computation in which a deterministic entangling\nquantum gate may be performed using, on average, a few hundred coherently interacting optical\nelements (beamsplitters, phase shifters, single photon sources, and photodetectors with feedforward).\nThis scheme combines ideas from the optical quantum computing proposal of Knill, Laflamme\nand Milburn [Nature 409 (6816), 46 (2001)], and the abstract cluster-state model of quantum\ncomputation proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5188 (2001)].\n\nOptical approaches to quantum computation are attractive due to the long decoherence times of photons,\nand the relative ease with which photons may be manipulated. A ground breaking proposal of Knill, Laflamme\nand Milburn [1] (KLM) demonstrated that all-optical\nquantum computation is, in principle, possible using just\nbeamsplitters, phase shifters, single photon sources, and\nphotodetectors with feedforward. Experimental demonstrations of several of the basic elements of KLM have\nsince been performed [2, 3, 4].\nDespite these impressive successes, the obstacles to\nfully scalable quantum computation with KLM remain\nformidable. The biggest challenge is to perform a twoqubit entangling gate in the near-deterministic fashion required for scalable quantum computation. KLM\npropose doing this using a combination of three ideas.\n(1) Using linear optics, single-photon sources and photodetectors, non-deterministically perform an entangling\ngate. This gate fails most of the time, destroying the\nstate of the computer, and so is not immediately suitable for quantum computation. (2) By combining the basic non-deterministic gate with quantum teleportation, a\nclass of non-deterministic gates which are not so destructive is found. We denote these gates CZn2 /(n+1)2 , where\nn is a positive integer. CZn2 /(n+1)2 has probability of\nsuccess n2 /(n+1)2 ; the larger n is, the greater the chance\nof success, but the more complex the corresponding optical circuit. (3) By using quantum error-correction, the\nprobability of the gate succeeding can be improved until\nthe gate is near-deterministic, allowing scalable quantum\ncomputation.\nThe combination of these three ideas allows quantum\ncomputation, in principle. Existing experimental implementations have demonstrated (1), and promise to do (2)\n(for small values of n) in the near future. However, to\nperform CZn2 /(n+1)2 for large values of n, or to do step\n(3), is far more difficult. KLM analyse a scheme in which\nthe CZ9/16 gate is combined with error-correction. To do\na single entangling gate with probability of success 95%\nrequires about 300 successful CZ9/16 gate operations, i.e.,\n\n\u2217 nielsen@physics.uq.edu.au\n\nand www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen\n\ntens of thousands of optical elements. Higher probabilities of success require more optical elements.\nThe present paper describes an approach to optical\nquantum computation that makes use of ideas (1) and\n(2) (for n = 1 and n = 2), but avoids step (3). The\nscheme combines KLM's non-deterministic gates with the\ncluster-state model of quantum computation proposed by\nRaussendorf and Briegel [5]. Using a CZ4/9 gate (which\nuses roughly 2 \u2212 3 times fewer optical elements than the\nCZ9/16 gate ) a single logical quantum gate in this proposal requires, on average, fewer than 8 successful CZ4/9\ngates. In this scheme there is an additional overhead due\nto the single-qubit gates; even when that is taken into account, fewer than 24 CZ4/9 gates are required to simulate\nan entangling gate. This is not only substantially simpler\nthan KLM, but the resulting logical gates work deterministically (assuming ideal optical elements), as opposed to\nthe 5% error experienced by KLM's entangling gates.\nYoran and Reznik [6] have proposed a scheme for optical quantum computation based on KLM, but using\nsubstantially simpler resources. This scheme has several\nelements in common with the current proposal, including offline preparation of a quantum state, which is used\nto do computation deterministically. (These similarities\nbear further investigation; although [6] does not use the\ncluster-state model of computation, their method has\nmany similarities.) For comparison, [6] estimate 20 \u2212 30\nCZ9/16 gates per logical gate, or perhaps 2 \u2212 3 times as\nmany optical elements as the cluster-state proposal, due\nto the greater complexity of the CZ9/16 gate.\nCluster-state quantum computation:\nThe\ncluster-state model of quantum computation [5] is a\nbeautiful alternate model of quantum computation,\nmathematically equivalent to the standard quantum circuit model, but quite different in physical aspect. We\ndescribe briefly the procedure used to simulate a quantum circuit in the cluster-state model; proofs may be\nfound in [5]. Note that this is an abstract model for\nquantum computation, not a proposal for physical implementation, so we describe it without reference to the\ndetails of a specific physical system.\nTo simulate a quantum circuit like that in Fig. 1 we\nfirst prepare the cluster state, an entangled network of\nqubits defined as in Fig. 2. Each qubit in the quan-\n\n\ftum circuit is replaced by a horizontal line of qubits in\nthe cluster state. Different horizontal qubits represent\nthe original qubit at different times, with the progress\nof time being from left to right. Each single-qubit gate\nin the quantum circuit is replaced by two horizontally\nadjacent qubits in the cluster state. (Alternately, one\nor three horizontally adjacent qubits could be used; that\nwould correspond to slightly different classes of singlequbit unitaries being simulated.) cphase gates in the\noriginal circuit are simulated using a vertical \"bridge\"\nconnecting the appropriate qubits.\n|+i\n\nU\u03b11 ,\u03b12\n\n|+i\n\nU\u03b21 ,\u03b22\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\nU\u03b13 ,\u03b14\nU\u03b23 ,\u03b24\n\nFIG. 1: A two-qubit quantum circuit.

Since the cphase gates commute with one\nanother, it does not matter in what order they are applied.\n\nWith the cluster state prepared, simulation of the circuit is accomplished using single-qubit measurements,\nand feedforward of measurement results to control the\nbasis in which later measurements are performed. The\nsequence of measurements is illustrated in Fig. 3. The\noutput of the circuit in Fig. 1 is the same as the state\nof the qubits at the end of the horizontal lines in Fig. 3,\nup to a known product of Pauli matrices, which can be\ncompensated for by classical postprocessing. Extending\nthis example along similar lines, we can simulate an arbitrary quantum circuit using just cluster-state preparation, single-qubit unitaries, measurements in the computational basis, and measurement feedforward [5].\n\n2\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n1.HZ\u03b11\n\n2.HZ\u03b1\u20322\n\n3.HZ\u03b1\u20323\n\n4.HZ\u03b1\u20324\n\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n\u2605\u2725\n1.HZ\u03b21\n\n2.HZ\u03b22\u2032\n\n3.HZ\u03b23\u2032\n\n4.HZ\u03b24\u2032\n\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\u2727\u2726\n\nFIG. 3: The circuit in Fig. 1 is simulated by measuring the\nindividual qubits of the cluster in the time order denoted by\nthe labels on the qubits, 1, 2, 3, . . .. Note that some qubits\nhave the same label, and may be measured in either order,\nor simultaneously. The measurement basis is indicated via a\nsingle-qubit unitary operation to be applied before measuring\nin the computational basis. For example, the first qubit on\nthe top line has HZ\u03b11 applied, before measuring in the computational basis. The prime notation, e.g. \u03b1\u20323 , indicates that\nthe value of \u03b1\u20323 is either \u00b1\u03b13 , with the sign determined by the\noutcome of previous measurements, as described in [5].\n\nFor convenience we have presented the cluster-state\nmodel in a slightly different form than [5]. In [5] the vertical bridges contain two additional intermediate qubits in\norder to simulate a cphase gate. The reason [5] has this\nmore complicated bridge is because they assume that the\nquantum circuit one wishes to simulate is not known until\nafter preparation of the cluster state. [5] make this assumption in order to show that a single cluster state can\nsimulate an arbitrary quantum computation of a given\nbreadth and depth. In implementation one knows the\ncircuit beforehand (e.g. Shor's circuit for factoring [7]),\nand the intermediate qubits in the bridge can be dispensed with. The simpler bridge, while not essential,\ndoes simplify the optical implementation.\nTo combine the cluster-state model with KLM we\nneed one final observation about the properties of cluster\nstates. Using the definition of the cluster state and the\ncphase gate we obtain the following expression for the\ncluster state, up to normalization,\nX\nP\n(1)\n(\u22121) j,k zj zk |z1 , z2 , . . .i,\nz1 ,z2 ,...\n\nwhere the first sum is over all configurations z1 , z2 , . . .\n(zj = 0, 1) of the qubits making up the cluster state, and\nthe sum in the exponent is over all pairs (j, k) of neighbouring qubits in the cluster. Suppose we measure one of\nthe cluster qubits in the computational basis, with outcome m. It follows from Eq. (1) that the posterior state\nis just a cluster state with that node deleted, up to a local Z m operation applied to each qubit neighbouring the\ndeleted qubit. These are known local unitaries, whose effect may be compensated in subsequent operations, so we\nmay effectively regard such a computational basis measurement as simply removing the qubit from the cluster.\nKLM optical quantum computation: KLM encodes a single qubit in two optical modes, A and B, with\nlogical qubit states |0iL \u2261 |01iAB , and |1iL \u2261 |10iAB .\nState preparation is done using single-photon sources,\n\n\f3\nwhile measurements in the computational basis may\nbe achieved using high-efficiency photodetectors. Such\nsources and detectors make heavy demands not entirely\nmet by existing optical technology, although encouraging\nprogress on both fronts has been reported recently. Arbitrary single-qubit operations are achieved using phase\nshifters and beamsplitters.\nThe main difficulty in KLM is achieving neardeterministic entangling interactions between qubits.\nKLM propose two basic constructions, one building upon\nthe other, for implementing a non-deterministic cphase\ngate, that is, a gate which with some probability succeeds, and with some probability fails, and whether the\ngate succeeds or fails is known. The two constructions\ndiffer in their success probability, and in whether failure\nresults in the destruction of the qubits, or in some incorrect operation being applied. We now summarize the\nbasic properties of the two constructions.\nThe destructive non-deterministic cphase gate: We\ndescribe a construction of Knill [8] that slightly simplifies the original KLM construction. Knill's construction\ntakes two logical qubits as input, and with probability\n2/27 applies a cphase gate, or else fails, destroying the\nstate of the qubits. The gate uses two phase shifters, four\nbeamsplitters, two single-photon ancillas, and two photodetectors measuring the ancillas; these must be capable\nof distinguishing 1 photon from 0 or 2 photons.\nNon-destructive non-deterministic cphase gates: The\ngate just described can be improved by combining it with\nthe idea of gate teleportation [9, 10, 11]. The result is a\ngate CZn2 /(n+1)2 which with probability n2 /(n + 1)2 applies a cphase to two input qubits, where n is a positive\ninteger. When the gate fails, the effect is to perform a\nmeasurement of those qubits in the computational basis.\nIncreasing values of n correspond to increasingly complicated teleportation circuits. The only two values of n\nwe shall need are n = 1 and n = 2, both of which use\nrelatively simple teleportation circuits, with just a few\noptical elements - for n = 1, 8 beamsplitters, 4 photodetectors, and 4 single-photon preparations; for n = 2\nless than 70 beamsplitters, 30 photodetectors, and 12\nsingle-photon preparations.\nThe basic CZn2 /(n+1)2 gate involves two teleportation\nsteps performed in parallel on the two qubits, succeeding with independent probabilities n/(n + 1). It is possible to perform these teleportations sequentially, with\nthe result [1] that if the first teleportation fails, we can\nabort the gate, without harming the second qubit. More\ngenerally, if we wish to perform cphase gates between\na single qubit S, and several other qubits A, B, . . ., it is\npossible to first perform all the teleportation steps involving just qubit S, and abort if any fail, preserving qubits\nA, B, . . .. If they all succeed, the remaining teleportation\nsteps involving the other qubits are performed, each with\nprobability of success n/(n + 1). Doing the gates in this\nsequential way will have considerable advantages in the\ncluster-state model of quantum computation.\nKLM achieves scalable quantum computation by com-\n\nbining quantum error-correction and the elements we\nhave described to develop a cphase gate that succeeds with much higher probability. This construction\nis avoided in the cluster-state implementation of optical\nquantum computation, and so we omit a description.\nOptical quantum computation with cluster\nstates: The idea is to build up the cluster state by nondeterministically adding extra qubits to the cluster using\nCZ4/9 or CZ1/4 gates. If this can be done, the other\noperations in the cluster-state model can be done following KLM's prescription. To simplify preparation it helps\nto suppose that each qubit in the cluster is involved in\nat most a single vertical bridge. The only reason more\nvertical connections might be required is if the quantum\ncircuit being simulated involves the same qubit in multiple parallel cphase gates. We may assume this does\nnot occur, without affecting the ability of a cluster-state\ncomputation to efficiently simulate a quantum circuit.\nWe will build the cluster up by interleaving two types\nof operation: attempting to add a site connected to the\ncurrent cluster through a single bond, and attempting\nto add a site connected to the current cluster through a\ndouble bond. It is not difficult to see that any cluster can\nbe built up by alternating operations of this type. We\nanalyse the two cases separately.\nThe procedure to add a site connected by a single single\nbond to the cluster is illustrated in Fig. 4. With probability 2/3 this succeeds, and a site is added to the cluster,\nwhile with probability 1/3 it fails, and a measurement in\nthe computational basis removes a qubit from the cluster,\nnamely, the qubit with which a cphase was attempted.\nThus, the expected number of sites added to the cluster\nis 2/3 \u00d7 1 + 1/3 \u00d7 (\u22121) = 1/3.\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e \u270e\u261e\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c \u270d\u270c\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\nFIG. 4: Attempting to add a site connected by a single bond\nto the current cluster, using a CZ4/9 gate. By performing\nthe gate with sequential teleportations we ensure that the\nprobability of success is 2/3.\n\nThe procedure used to add a site connected to the\ncurrent cluster by a double bond is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nWe sequentially attempt CZ4/9 gates between qubits S\nand A, and S and B. As described earlier, this can be\ndone so that each gate works with probability 2/3. If the\ngate between S and A fails, then qubit A is removed from\nthe cluster, and we abort the procedure. This occurs with\nprobability 1/3. If it succeeds, then we attempt CZ4/9\nbetween qubit S and B. If this fails, then qubit B is\nremoved from the cluster, and we abort the procedure.\nThis occurs with probability 2/9. If both gates succeed\nthen we add qubit S to the cluster. This occurs with\nprobability 4/9. The expected number of sites added to\nthe cluster is thus \u22121/9.\nObserve that any cluster may be built up by alternating two steps: (a) attempting to add one or more sites\n\n\f\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e \u270e\u261e\n\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c \u270d\u270c\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e\n\u270e\u261e \u270e\u261e\nA\n\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c\n\u270d\u270c \u270d\u270c\nB\n\nS\n\nFIG. 5: Adding a site, S, to the cluster by attaching it to two\nqubits A and B already in the cluster.\n\nthat are connected to the current cluster by a single bond,\nand (b) attempting to add just one site that is connected\nby a double bond. We conclude that for every two attempts to add a site, the average number of sites added\nto the cluster is at least 1/3 \u2212 1/9 = 2/9. Thus a cluster\nof size s(n) can be grown using roughly 9s(n) attempts to\nadd a single site. For maximal space efficiency, note that\nif the circuit being simulated has breadth n and depth\nd(n), then it suffices to prepare only the O(n log(d(n)))\nleftmost qubits in the cluster, adding extra qubits to the\ncluster as earlier qubits are measured, without danger of\ndestroying the cluster.\nWhat resources are required to simulate a standard\nquantum circuit, in this proposal? If we assume that the\ncircuit being simulated involves two single-qubit unitaries\nU\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 for each cphase gate (one on each qubit), then for\nevery three gates we will need to add four sites to the\ncluster, which means less than 24 successful CZ4/9 gates.\nThat is, fewer than 8 successful CZ4/9 gates are used per\nlogical gate. Note, however, that both the single-qubit\nand entangling gates in the original quantum circuit require these CZ4/9 gates, so it is perhaps fairest to use an\nestimate of about 24 successful CZ4/9 gates per entangling gate. Even with this caveat, these requirements are\nquite modest compared with other proposals.\nWe have described a scheme for optically preparing\ncluster states and using them for computation. Many\nalternate approaches to preparation may be conceived.\nOne interesting approach is illustrated in Fig. 6. \"Microclusters\" are non-deterministically prepared and then\n\"glued\" together using CZ1/4 gates, in order to create\nthe cluster. An advantage of this approach is that the\nbasic elements are CZ1/4 gates, instead of the more complex CZ4/9 gates. In the short term this is likely to be\nsimpler to implement, and to offer proof-of-principle ex-\n\n[1] E. Knill, R. Laflamme, and G. J. Milburn, Nature 409,\n46 (2001).\n[2] T. B. Pittman, M. J.

Over the long run, however,\nthe polynomial overhead incurred by this scheme means\nthat the scheme based on CZ4/9 gates is more promising.\nConclusion: By combining the abstract cluster-state\nmodel of computation with KLM we obtain a scheme\nfor optical quantum computation significantly less demanding than in existing schemes based on single-photon\npreparation, linear optics, and photodetectors. How it\ncompares with schemes using different basic elements,\nlike the coherent-state scheme of Ralph et al [12], depends on future technological developments. Work is underway to simplify the scheme further, and to address\nthe question of fault-tolerance.\n\u2765\n\u2711\n\u2711\n(a)\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765 (b)\n\u2765\n\u2711\n\u2711\n\u25d7\n\u2711\n\u25d7\n\u2711\n\u2765 \u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765 \u2765 \u2765\n\u25d7\n\u25d7 \u2765\n\u25d7\n\u25d7\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2711\n\u2711\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2711\n\u25d7\n\u2711\n\u2711\n\u25d7 \u2765\n\u2711\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765\n\u2765 \u2765 \u2765\n\u25d7\n\u25d7 \u2765\n\u25d7\n\u25d7 \u2765\nFIG. 6: (a) We prepare microclusters non-deterministically,\nas illustrated, and glue them together using parallel CZ1/4\ngates to give a cluster like that shown in (b).

For a cluster of size s(n),\nusing microclusters with O(log(s(n))) dangling nodes gives a\nhigh probability of successfully preparing the entire cluster.\nThe disadvantage is that preparing the microclusters nondeterministically incurs a polynomial overhead.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nEspecial thanks to Alexei Gilchrist, whose careful reading located a significant error in my original formulation.\nThanks also to Chris Dawson, Jennifer Dodd, Andrew\nDoherty, Tim Ralph, Terry Rudolph and Andrew White\nfor helpful discussions.\n\n[7] P.
