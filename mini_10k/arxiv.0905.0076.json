However, the data obtained so far are fragmentary and sometimes\nconflicting,2 and we believe there is now a clear need to develop simple models analogous to\nthose used to interpret low temperature data. These models are needed in order to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that determine high-temperature phase diagrams, while\nproviding a framework within which to interpret and unify experimental and first-principles\ndata. We describe here how a simple parameterised tight-binding model can be used to\ncalculate the high-temperature free energies of liquid and solid transition metals, and hence\ntheir melting properties, and we show how the model can help to interpret the available\ndata. In the present work, we confine ourselves to the case of an approximately half-filled\nd-band, focusing particularly on the interpretation of data for molybdenum.\nShock measurements gave the first experimental information about melting curves at\nMbar pressures, and data are available for several transition metals, including Fe, Mo, Ta\nand W.3,4,5,6,7,8 The thermodynamic states accessible in traditional shock experiments lie\non a trajectory called the principal Hugoniot, which provides only a single point on the\nmelting curve. On the other hand, major advances in static compression techniques, based\non the diamond anvil cell (DAC), in principle allow entire melting curves and other phase\nboundaries to be mapped at pressures and temperatures up to \u223c 200 GPa and \u223c 4000 K.\nMelting data from static techniques have been reported for Fe, Mo, Ta, W, V and Y.2,9,10,11,12\nThere appear to be enormous differences between the melting curves of some transition\nmetals from dynamic and static techniques, with the latter giving much lower melting slopes.\nThe resulting differences of Tm at Mbar pressures can be several thousand K.\nMelting curves from first-principles modelling began to appear over 10 years ago,13,14 and\nthere are now several well established approaches, including the calculation of solid and liquid\nfree energies, the \"reference coexistence\" method, and the explicit first-principles simulation\nof coexisting solid and liquid.15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 For Fe, all three approaches have been used,\n2\n\n\fand the agreement between them is excellent.23,24 Since DFT calculations are parameterfree, and reproduce very accurately key quantities such as cold compression curves, phonon\nfrequencies, Hugoniot curves, and the zero-pressure melting temperatures of transition metals, there is every reason to expect that their predictions of melting properties will also\nbe reliable, and there is considerable evidence that this is the case. For transition metals\nfor which static and dynamic measurements disagree seriously, first-principles calculations\nsupport the correctness of the dynamic measurements.25,30\nMolybdenum is one of the transition metals that have been intensively studied by DFT\nsimulation, and it illustrates the recent controversies. Two independent sets of first-principles\ncalculations21,25,26,27,28 agree rather closely with each other and support the high melting\ncurve deduced from shock measurements, this curve rising far more steeply with pressure\nthan the flat melting curve obtained from DAC data.11 However, the shock measurements6\nalso indicate a solid-solid phase boundary, which may be the transition interpreted as melting\nin the DAC work.29 A similar conflict between high shock and first-principles melting curves\nand a low DAC melting curve is also found in Ta,11,12,30 and it has been proposed that the\ntransition seen in DAC may also be a solid-solid transition. We believe that simple models\nmay help to resolve these controversies, by allowing the melting properties of transition\nmetals to be related to the fundamental mechanisms that determine their energetics.\nModels for the energetics of transition metals are generally built on the principle that the\ntotal energy can be approximated as the sum of the electronic band energy and a repulsive\npairwise interaction. The many different models that have been proposed differ mainly in\ntheir representation of the band energy. To explain the broad features of transition-metal\nenergetics on a scale of several eV, including the roughly parabolic variations of cohesive\nenergy, lattice parameter and bulk modulus with band filling, it suffices to assume a structureless d-band density of states (DOS), whose band width depends only on atomic volume\n(and chemical element).1,31 The simplest total-energy model based on this idea consists of a\nsum of repulsive pair potentials plus a position-independent bonding term depending on the\naverage atomic volume. We will refer to this as the REP+VOL model. More sophisticated\ntypes of total-energy models, including the closely related second-moment,32 embeddedatom and Finnis-Sinclair models,33,34 allow the second moment of the local DOS on each\natom to depend on the distances to near neighbours. However, such models do not contain the physics needed to account for the well-known low-temperature structural sequence\n3\n\n\fthat occurs through all the transition-metal series, from hexagonal close-packed (hcp), to\nbody-centred cubic (bcc), to hcp, and finally to face-centred cubic (fcc). The energy differences of typically a few tenths of an eV between these structures are clearly essential\nfor any discussion of phase diagrams, but they arise from the structure dependent form of\nthe DOS. There are models that account for this by working with higher moments of the\nDOS than the second,1 but a more straightforward approach is to express the total energy\nfunction directly in terms of a tight-binding (TB) model.35,36 In the present work, we use\nthe simplest possible TB total-energy model, consisting of repulsive pair interactions plus\nthe sum of single-electron energies calculated from a canonical d-band TB model, without\nsp bands. We refer to this as the REP+TB model. With this simple model, we sacrifice the\nability to describe the effect on the DOS of sp \u2212 d hybridisation, and the pressure dependent\ntransfer of electrons between sp and d bands. We make this sacrifice in order to simplify\nthe analysis.\nThe principal question addressed in this paper is: What are the main parameters that\ndetermine the melting curves and other melting properties of transition metals, and what\nare the roles of these parameters? As part of this overall question, we would like to know\nat what level of detail we need to describe the d-band bonding. In particular, do we need\na detailed description of the structure-dependent electronic DOS in order to understand\nmelting, or is a simpler model, such as REP+VOL, sufficient? In trying to answer these\nquestions, our strategy will be to relate the melting properties of the REP+TB models to\nthose of the pure REP model.\nUltimately, we want to use parameterised tight-binding models to achieve a systematic\noverall understanding of the melting properties of the entire family of transition metals.\nHowever, even the simple models used here require rather extensive calculations to treat\nmelting for a single metal, and for that reason we confine ourselves here to a narrow range\nof d-band filling in the region of half filling. We shall present a simple scheme for fixing the\nparameters of our model by fitting to zero-temperature first-principles data, and we shall see\nthat, for the case of Mo treated here, we reproduce high-temperature first-principles results\nreasonably well.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section II, we present our REP+TB\nmodel for the total energy function, and we describe the scheme we use to fix the model\nparameters using information from T = 0 K DFT calculations. In Section III, we present\n4\n\n\fa variety of tests of the model against DFT, both at T = 0 K and for high-temperature\nsolid and liquid Mo. The procedures used to calculate the free energies of the pure REP\nand REP+TB systems are described in Section IV, where we also report our results for the\nmelting curves and the volume and entropy of melting. This is followed in Section V by\nan analysis of the relationships between the melting properties of the REP and REP+TB\nsystems. Discussion and conclusions are in Section VI .\n\nII.\n\nTHE TIGHT-BINDING TOTAL-ENERGY MODEL\n\nThe total energy Utot of our tight-binding (TB) model for a system of N atoms having\nposition ri is:\nUtot (r1 , r2 , . . . rN ) =\n\n1X\nVREP (rij ) + UTB (r1 , r2 , . . . rN ) ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\ni6=j\n\nwhere VREP (r) is a repulsive pair potential and rij = |ri \u2212rj |. In conventional TB treatments,\nthe energy UTB (r1 , r2 , . . . rN ) represents the sum of single-electron energies \u01ebn of occupied\nstates, but here we include the effect of thermal excitation of electrons, so that UTB is\nactually a free energy, defined as:\nUTB = 2\n\nX\n\nfn \u01ebn \u2212 T S ,\n\n(2)\n\nn\n\nwhere fn is the Fermi-Dirac occupation number of energy eigenstate n at temperature T ,\nand S is the electronic entropy, given by:\nS = 2kB\n\nX\n\n[fn ln fn + (1 \u2212 fn ) ln(1 \u2212 fn )] .\n\n(3)\n\nn\n\nThe factors of 2 in Eqns (2) and (3) account for spin. The TB Hamiltonian used to calculate\nthe \u01ebn is described next, and the repulsive pair potential is described after that.\n\nA.\n\nThe canonical d-band tight-binding Hamiltonian\n\nSince we include only d-electrons in our model, the Hamiltonian matrix elements\nhi\u03b1|H|j\u03b2i (i, j label atoms, \u03b1, \u03b2 label atomic orbitals) characterize hopping transitions\nof electrons between the d-orbitals xy, yz, zx, x2 \u2212 y 2 , 3z 2 \u2212 r 2 on each atom. We employ\n5\n\n\fan orthogonal TB model, in which hi\u03b1|j\u03b2i = \u03b4ij \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . The dependence of the matrix elements\non interatomic distance is taken to be exponential, so that:\nhi\u03b1|H|j\u03b2i = G\u03b1\u03b2 (r\u0302ij )Ab exp(\u2212rij /Rb ) .\n\n(4)\n\nThe factor G\u03b1\u03b2 depends on the unit vector r\u0302ij = (ri \u2212 rj )/rij in the direction from ri to rj ,\nand it is well known that it can be expressed in terms of three basic matrix elements dd\u03c3,\ndd\u03c0 and dd\u03b4. Here, we assume the canonical ratios37 dd\u03c3 : dd\u03c0 : dd\u03b4 = \u22126 : 4 : \u22121. For\nconvenience, and without loss of generality, we assume the diagonal elements hi\u03b1|H|i\u03b1i to\nbe zero. In order to simplify the numerical simulations, we cut off the matrix elements so\nthat they vanish beyond a distance Rcut . The exponential is replaced by a cubic polynomial\nin the interval R1 < r < Rcut , the polynomial coefficients being chosen to ensure continuity\nof hi\u03b1|H|j\u03b2i and its first derivative at R1 and Rcut . For the Mo model developed here, we\nchose R1 = 4.7 \u00c5 and Rcut = 4.9 \u00c5.\nThe TB density of states (DOS) nd (E), defined as:\nnd (E) =\nis normalized so that\n(1)\n\nR\n\n2 X\n\u03b4(E \u2212 \u01ebn ) ,\nN n\n\n(5)\n\nnd (E) dE = 10. Since the trace of hi\u03b1|H|j\u03b2i is zero, the first moment\n\n\u03bcd of the DOS, defined as:\n(1)\n\u03bcd\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nEnd (E) dE\n\n\u001eZ\n\nnd (E) dE\n\n(6)\n(2)\n\nis zero. To fix the values of Ab and Rb , we require that the second moment \u03bcd of the DOS\nof our model, defined as:\n(2)\n\u03bcd\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nE nd (E) dE\n\n\u001eZ\n\nnd (E) dE ,\n\n(7)\n\nshould agree with the volume dependent d-band second moment given by DFT.\nTo apply this procedure to bcc Mo, we performed DFT calculations using the fullpotential linearized augmented plane-wave method (FP-LAPW)38,39,40,41 as implemented in\nthe WIEN2k code.42 We used the Wu-Cohen43 form of generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA), which is known to perform well for transition metals.44,45 Local orbitals are added\nto the standard LAPW basis in order to describe valence and semicore states. The technical\nparameters in the calculations were set as in Ref. [45] . The total and projected d-channel\n6\n\n\fdensities of states were obtained by using the modified tetrahedron method of Bl\u00f6chl et\nal.46 , and for the projection we used an atomic sphere radius of typically 1.32 \u00c5. We found\nthat Ab = 18.5745 eV and Rb = 0.8950 \u00c5 give very good agreement with the DFT results\n(2)\n\nfor \u03bcd at P = 0 and 350 GPa (see Table I) and these values are used throughout this work.\n(2)\n\nThe quantity \u03bcd is closely related to the width of the d-band Wd , which is the difference\nbetween the lowest and highest energy levels, Edb and Edt respectively, in the d-band DOS.\nIn DFT calculations, the bottom of the d-band Edb can be determined by direct inspection\nof the DOS, whereas Edt may be difficult to identify because of hybridization of states with\ndifferent angular momenta (see Fig. 1). Here we identify Edt with an abrupt drop in the\nprojected d-DOS at high energies followed by a smooth continuum. For Mo, we find that at\nequilibrium Edb and Edt are \u22125.5 and 4.6 eV, respectively, while at a pressure of P = 350 GPa\nthey are Edb = \u221210.8 and Edt = 8.6 eV (see Fig. 1). As shown in Table I, these values compare\nwell with the tight-binding results obtained with the Ab and Rb values quoted above.\nIn order to reproduce the energy difference between the Fermi level and bottom of the\nd-band and the form of the d-DOS near EF , we treat the number of d electrons Nd as an\nadjustable parameter.47 This is important, since many properties of transition metals are\nunderstood in terms of the form of the electronic DOS near the Fermi level (e.g. the relative\nstability of different structures, electronic specific heat, etc). For Mo, we find that Nd = 4.3,\nrather than Nd = 5.0, reproduces quite well the DFT results over a range of pressures (see\nFig. 1). We use this value of Nd , unless stated otherwise.\n\nB.\n\nThe repulsive pair potential\n\nThe pair potential VREP (r) is also assumed to have an exponential form:\nVREP (r) = Ar exp(\u2212r/Rr ) .\n\n(8)\n\nThe parameters Ar and Rr are chosen so as to reproduce as closely as possible the measured\nP -V curve of bcc Mo at low temperatures. This is essentially the same as fitting to DFT,\nsince with the Wu-Cohen functional the DFT and experimental P -V curves are almost\nidentical. The values Ar = 3164.3454 eV and Rr = 0.3350 \u00c5 give excellent agreement with\nexperimental data of Ref. [6], and DFT calculations (Fig. 2), and we use them throughout\nthis work. The same spatial cut-off distance and smoothing as used for the Hamiltonian\n7\n\n\fmatrix elements is applied to the repulsive pair potential.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nSIMULATION TECHNIQUES AND TESTS OF THE MODEL\nMolecular dynamics simulation\n\nAll the calculations on our TB model were performed with the OXON code,48,49,50,51\nusing diagonalization of the Hamiltonian for each set of ionic positions. In the molecular\ndynamics (m.d.) simulations, we used the Verlet algorithm to integrate Newton's equations\nof motion, with a typical time step of 1.25 fs. The total force acting on each atom is\nthe exact derivative of the total energy Utot with respect to its atomic position. Our m.d.\nsimulations were performed in the canonical NVT ensemble, using Andersen's thermostat to\navoid errors due to lack of ergodicity.52 In using this thermostat, the atomic velocities were\nrandomized by drawing them from a Maxwellian distribution every 0.2 ps. A typical m.d.\nrun consisted of 2 ps for equilibration, followed by 10 ps for the calculation of averages. The\nm.d. simulations were performed on a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 supercell containing N = 128 atoms, and\n\u0393-point sampling was used to integrate over the first Brillouin zone. Pressure was obtained\ndirectly in each run using the virial formula.\n\nB.\n\nTests of the model\n\nWe have performed a series of zero and finite-temperature tests of our model in order\nto assess its accuracy compared with first-principles results and experimental data. In our\nfirst test, we evaluated the relative stability of the different crystal structures at different\nvolumes. To this end, we computed the energy differences \u2206E of the hcp and fcc structures\nwith respect to the bcc structure at equilibrium (V0 = 15.55 \u00c53 /atom) and a pressure\nof P = 350 GPa (V = 9.50 \u00c53 /atom) . At equilibrium, we found fcc-bcc and hcp-bcc\ndifferences of 0.40 and 0.46 eV with DFT, compared with 0.26 and 0.42 with TB. We thus\nreproduce correctly the relative zero-pressure stability of the different crystal structures,\nthough we predict the fcc phase to be appreciably more stable than hcp. At P = 350 GPa,\nwe found fcc-bcc and hcp-bcc differences of 0.30 and 0.32 eV with DFT, compared with 0.42\nand 0.30 eV with TB. At this pressure, we thus predict that the energy of the hcp phase\nis lower than that of the fcc phase, but bcc is correctly predicted to be the most stable\n8\n\n\fstructure. We note that at both pressures the agreement between the values of \u2206Ehcp\u2212bcc\nobtained with DFT and TB is very good.\nWe have also computed the phonon frequencies of bcc Mo at the experimental equilibrium volume V0 = 15.55 \u00c53 /atom .6 Our calculations are based on the small-displacement\nmethod,53,54 and we have used a supercell containing 64 atoms and 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 k-point\ngrid over the first Brillouin zone. In Fig. 3 , we show our results together with experimental\ndata from Ref. [6] and ab initio calculations from Ref. [25] for comparison; the agreement\nbetween the TB curves and the others is unexpectedly good, given the simplicity of our\nmodel. We note that the experimental phonon anomaly near the H point (1, 0, 0) is not well\nreproduced by either TB or DFT.25,56 We have calculated the phonon frequencies also for\nthe fcc and hcp structures of our TB model. We find that for Nd = 4.3 and Nd = 5.0 there\nare always imaginary frequencies, so that these structures are unstable, at least at T = 0.\nIt worth noting that for slightly larger Nd values the fcc and hcp phases become stable at\nhigh pressures; for instance, for Nd = 5.2 fcc becomes stable at P \u2243 400 GPa.\nThe finite-temperature tests of our model include an analysis of the structure of the\nsolid and liquid at different pressures. In Fig. 4 , we plot the radial distribution function\nobtained from long (total simulation time \u223c 10 ps) DFT and TB m.d. runs. The solid\nphase is simulated at T = 2000 K and P = 50 GPa , while the liquid is at T = 8250 K and\nP = 250 GPa. (These are states well below and above the melting curve of Mo given by\nfirst-principles calculations.)21,25 In both phases, the DFT and TB curves agree very well,\nthe main difference being that TB gives interatomic distances slightly smaller than those\nfrom DFT simulations.\nIn Fig. 5 , we show the electronic DOS of solid and liquid Mo obtained at the same\nthermodynamic conditions as for the radial distribution function. Although the DOS's\nobtained with TB and DFT are not identical, the corresponding band-widths and energy\ndifferences EF \u2212 Edb are very similar, especially for the crystal.\nThe main conclusion from all these tests is that, in spite of the formal simplicity of our\nTB model, it reproduces quite reliably many important properties of solid and liquid Mo.\n\n9\n\n\fIV.\n\nFREE ENERGY AND MELTING PROPERTIES OF THE MODEL\n\nOur overall strategy to obtain the melting properties of our model is based on the calculation of the Helmholtz free energy Ftot (V, T ) of the solid and liquid phases. To obtain\nFtot (V, T ) , we start from the Helmholtz free energy FREP (V, T ) of the purely repulsive system\ndescribed by the pair potential VREP (r) , and use thermodynamic integration to determine\nthe difference Ftot (V, T ) \u2212 FREP (V, T ) at fixed (V, T ). This thermodynamic integration is\nbased on the general principle that for total-energy functions U0 and U1 , the difference of\nthe corresponding free energies F0 (V, T ) and F1 (V, T ) at state point (V, T ) is given by\nZ 1\nF1 \u2212 F0 =\nh\u2206Ui\u03bb d\u03bb ,\n(9)\n0\n\nwhere \u2206U = U1 \u2212 U0 and h*i\u03bb denotes the thermal average in the ensemble governed by the\ntotal energy function U\u03bb = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)U0 + \u03bbU1 . In practice, we use this type of thermodynamic integration to determine Ftot (V, T ) \u2212 FREP (V, T ) at a set of (V, T ) states, the value\nof Ftot (V, T ) at other states being obtained by integrating the relations P = \u2212(\u2202Ftot /\u2202V )T\nand Etot = (\u2202(\u03b2Ftot )/\u2202\u03b2)V , where \u03b2 = 1/kB T and Etot is the total internal energy of the\nsystem. The starting point of all the calculations is the free energy FREP (V, T ) of the pure\nexponential system. Surprisingly, the thermodynamic properties of this system appear not\nto have been studied before, so we have performed our own calculations of FREP (V, T ), as\ndescribed next.\n\nA.\n\nFree energy and phase diagram of the pure exponential model\n\nDetails of the calculations of the free energy of the pure exponential model will be reported\nelsewhere, and here we give only a brief summary. Our values of FREP (V, T ) were obtained\nby thermodynamic integration (Eq. (9)), using as reference system the inverse-6 system\ninteracting with pair potential Vinv6 (r) = A/r 6 . We take the Helmholtz free energy of this\nsystem from Ref. [57] for the liquid, bcc and fcc phases, and from Ref. [58] for the hcp phase.\nThe thermodynamic integration calculations were performed at a series of (V, T ) points\nin which the free-energy difference FREP \u2212 Finv6 was calculated by averaging VREP \u2212 Vinv6\nover long molecular dynamics runs in which U\u03bb (see Eq. (9)) was varied continuously at a\nswitching rate that guaranteed reversibility (that is, adiabatically). For the solid phase, we\nconsidered 12 volumes distributed uniformly over the interval 9.68 \u2264 V \u2264 30.80 \u00c53 /atom,\n10\n\n\fand the temperature was set to T = 1000 K in all cases. For the liquid phase, 15 points\nwithin the same volume range as used for the solid and temperatures taken at intervals of\n1000 K from initial guessed melting temperatures up to 10000 K , were considered. We\ndetermined Ftot (V, T ) at the other state points by performing thermodynamic integration\nwith respect to pressure and internal energy.\nOur calculated FREP (V, T ) values were cross-checked against simulations in which the\nliquid coexists with the bcc, fcc or hcp solid. These coexistence simulations were performed\nin the (N, V, T ) ensemble, and we used the techniques explained in Refs. [25] and [18] .\nSimulation boxes containing up to 10, 000 atoms were used in the calculations. For each\npair of coexisting phases, the pressure dependence of the melting temperature Tm (P ) was\nfitted to the equation\n\n\u0013c\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\nP\n\u22121 ,\n(10)\nTm (P ) = a 1 +\nb\nwhich resembles the so-called Simon equation59 , but is adjusted to ensure that Tm = 0 at\n\nP = 0. Results for the bcc, hcp and fcc melting curves are shown in Fig. 6 . For the\nbcc melting curve, the values are accurately reproduced with parameters a = 564.6 K,\nb = 1.69 GPa and c = 0.5236. The volumes and enthalpies per atom of the coexisting\nsolid and liquid were obtained from independent molecular dynamics simulations performed\non supercells containing 1, 000 atoms at (P, T ) points on the melting curve. The melting\nvolumes and entropy of fusion for the bcc melting curve are given in Table II. In fact, the\nmelting curves obtained from the coexistence simulations were not perfectly consistent with\nthe Helmholtz free energy results. We have searched carefully for the source of these errors,\nand we think it is possible that they may come from small imprecisions of the free energies\nof the inverse-6 system. To correct for these errors, we shifted the free energies of the\nbcc, hcp and fcc phases with respect to that of the liquid; the corrections depend solely on\ntemperature, and are typically 10 \u2212 20 meV/atom. We note that differences between energy\nshifts of all three crystal structures amount to less than 5 meV/atom, so therefore, total\nfree energy differences between the bcc, fcc, and hcp phases, or equivalently their relative\nstability, are not affected appreciably by our corrections.\nAs a further cross-check, we calculated the free energies of the bcc and fcc phases by\nthermodynamic integration, starting from a different reference system. For this, we took\na harmonically vibrating solid, with the harmonic force-constant matrix calculated for a\nsystem of particles interacting via the repulsive pure exponential pair potential at volume\n11\n\n\fV = 14.19 \u00c53 /atom (P \u223c 204 GPa). These calculations are based on the small-displacement\nmethod.53,54 For both the bcc and the fcc phases, the small discrepancies between the free\nenergies obtained from the inverse-6 and harmonic reference systems are typically 10 \u2212\n20 meV/atom at temperatures near melting.\n\nB.\n\nFree energy and melting properties of the TB model\n\nOur thermodynamic integration calculations to determine the difference Ftot \u2212 FREP were\nperformed by varying \u03bb adiabatically from 0 to 1 over a time of 9 ps. Simulation boxes\ncontaining 128 atoms and \u0393-point sampling over the first Brillouin zone were used. The\nquantity \u2206U in these calculations (see Eq. (9)) is the TB band free-energy UTB (see Eqs. (2)\nand (3)). In order to reduce errors due to non-adiabaticity, we perform a complete cycle\nin which \u03bb goes from 0 to 1 and back again, and to reduce statistical errors this whole\nR1\ncycle is repeated. The thermodynamic integral 0 d\u03bb hUTB i\u03bb is obtained as the average\n\nof the values in the four half-cycles. The typical standard deviation of these values is\nless than 10 meV/atom . An example of the hUTB i\u03bb values obtained over a whole run at\nV = 15.55 \u00c53 /atom and temperature T = 5048 K is shown in Fig. 7. We note that hUTB i\u03bb\nvaries typically by \u223c 0.5 eV/atom as \u03bb varies between 0 and 1 .\nThese thermodynamic integration calculations were performed at ten (V, T ) states in\neach of the liquid and solid phases. For the solid phase, a temperature of T = 1000 K\nwas chosen for all the volumes; volumes were drawn uniformly from the interval 9.68 16.32 \u00c53 /atom. For the liquid phase, temperatures of typically 3000 K above the melting\ncurve of the repulsive potential were chosen and the same set of volumes as for the solid\nwas used. The value of Ftot (V, T ) at the other thermodynamic states was obtained by\nthermodynamic integration with respect to pressure and internal energy.\nIn Fig. 8 , we report the melting line of our TB model for d-band fillings Nd = 4.3\nand 5.0, obtained from the Helmholtz free energy calculations described above. We have\nconsidered different Nd values in order to assess the effect of this on the melting properties.\nSince our harmonic calculations showed that only the bcc structure is vibrationally stable,\nwe will report only results for melting from the bcc structure. In practice, once the free\nenergies Ftot (V, T ) of the liquid and solid phases are known, we have determined the melting\npressure Pm and volumes of the liquid and solid phases at each temperature by the Maxwell\n12\n\n\fdouble-tangent construction. The Simon formula Tm = a (1 + Pm /b)c was then used to fit\nour results and interpolate at any desired pressure. For Nd = 4.3(5.0), the values of the\nSimon parameters are a = 2865.9(1678.6) K, b = 118.3(35.1) GPa and c = 0.8530(0.6376).\nIn Table III, we report results for the fractional change of volume \u2206V /Vs and entropy of\nfusion \u2206S at points on the melting curves.\nIn Fig. 8, we also plot the melting curves of the pure exponential system and of Mo\nobtained from DFT calculations.25 Although accurate reproduction of real-world data is not\nthe main objective of this work, we note that our model (case Nd = 4.3) gives very good\nagreement with the P = 0 melting temperatures for Mo of Tm = 2883 K from experiment61 ,\nand Tm = 2894 K from DFT simulations.25 With increasing P , significant discrepancies\nbetween the TB (Nd = 4.3) and DFT melting curves appear. However, good agreement is\npartly recovered at high-P and high-T for Nd = 5.0.\n\nV.\n\nANALYSIS OF MELTING RELATIONSHIPS\n\nWe pointed out in the Introduction that the gross features of transition metal energetics\nat T = 0 K can be understood on the basis of a model in which the structure of the\nelectronic density of states DOS is ignored. This suggests that the simplest possible model\nfor understanding the melting behaviour of transition metals is to add to the free energy of\nthe pure exponential model FREP (V, T ) a bonding term Ed (V ) that depends only on volume\nand does not depend on temperature or on the phase of the system. To test this idea, we\nhave carried out numerical calculations in which we have set Ed (V ) equal to the bonding\nenergy contribution to the total energy Utot of the bcc solid at zero temperature (Nd = 4.3).\nAs expected, Ed (V ) varies between \u221210 and \u221220 eV/atom over the volume range of interest.\nThe resulting melting curve is shown in Fig. 9 . This very simple model necessarily shifts\nthe melting curve upwards, and our results show that the computed melting temperatures\nare seriously overestimated, typically by around 50% . This result shows that there must\nbe a significant dependence of the bonding energy on structure for given volume in the\nregion of the melting curve. To illustrate this, we show in Fig. 10 (Top) the bonding free\nenergy \u2206F = Ftot \u2212 FREP as a function of volume at T = 6000 K for the liquid and bcc\nsolid. Remarkably, the difference between \u2206F for liquid and solid is rather constant and\nhas a value of \u223c 0.2 eV/atom, \u2206F being lower in the liquid. This means that the structure\n13\n\n\fdependence of the bonding stabilizes the liquid phase over the solid and therefore lowers the\nmelting curve.\nIt is interesting to ask whether \u2206F is significantly influenced by the response of the structure to the presence of the tight-binding energy. To answer this, we show in Fig. 10 (Bottom)\nthe quantity \u2206F \u2212 hUTB iREP where hUTB iREP is the thermal average of UTB evaluated in the\nensemble of the VREP potential. The results show that \u2206F \u2212 hUTB iREP is quite significant\nin both phases. Moreover, the difference of this quantity for the liquid and solid indicates\nthat the structure of the liquid responds significantly more than the solid to the presence of\nthe TB energy. This effect contributes significantly to the lowering of the melting curve.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe present work is intended as a step towards developing an overall understanding\nof the phase diagrams of entire transition-metal series over a wide range of pressures and\ntemperatures. At T = 0 K, generalized phase diagrams (GPD) as a function of pressure P\nand atomic number Z can be computed by DFT, and we recently reported a phase diagram\nof this kind for the 4d series.45 The construction of a complete GPD as a function of P ,\nT and Z using DFT is too difficult at present, but we believe that it should be feasible\nusing TB models of the kind described here. With this in mind, it is encouraging that our\nREP+TB model for Mo, parameterized using only T = 0 K data, reproduces quite well the\nmelting curve and properties of the high-T solid and liquid known from DFT. We have used\nthe same REP+TB model, parameterized using the same scheme, for most of the other 4d\nmetals, and we hope to report P -T phase diagrams for them in due course. We note that\ncorresponding-states arguments will allow the free energies and melting data for the pure\nREP model reported here to be used to obtain the free energies of all these transition metals\nby thermodynamic integration.\nSince the properties of Mo over a wide range of P and T seem to be quite well described\nby our REP+TB model, it is natural to ask how the melting properties of the model are\nrelated to those of the pure REP model, consisting only of exponential repulsion. The\nmelting temperature of REP goes to zero as P \u2192 0, so it is clear that the TB energy is\ncrucial in determining the Tm of transition metals at ambient P . However, we might expect\nthe repulsion to be increasingly dominant at high P . There is an interesting connection\n14\n\n\fhere with the melting properties of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) model for rare gases. It was\nrecognised long ago60 that as P \u2192 \u221e, the attractive r \u22126 potential of LJ has diminishing\ninfluence on the properties of the coexisting solid and liquid, so that the volume and entropy\nof fusion tend to those the soft-sphere repulsion r \u221212 model. As we have shown, the melting\ncurves of our REP+TB model for Mo with Nd = 4.3 and 5.0 do become close to that of pure\nREP at high P . Furthermore, the relative melting volumes \u2206V /Vs of REP+TB for both\nNd values decrease steadily with increasing P , in a way that is consistent with convergence\ntowards the melting volume of pure REP. However, this convergence is slow, since even at\nP \u2243 400 GPa, \u2206V /Vs for REP is 1.1, while for REP+TB it is \u223c 2.1 and 1.5 for Nd = 4.3\nand 5.0 respectively. The entropy of fusion \u2206S is 0.74 kB for REP over the whole pressure\nrange studied. For Nd = 4.3, \u2206S decreases steadily towards this value with increasing P ,\nwhile for Nd = 5.0 it remains a little above this value for all P .\nIn the Introduction, we asked what are the main parameters that determine the melting\nproperties of transition metals. The success of our REP+TB model for Mo suggests that the\ntwo parameters Ar and Rr specifying the strength and range of the interatomic repulsion,\nthe strength and range Ab and Rb of the TB matrix elements, and the number Nd of delectrons, may be enough. (Firm conclusions must, of course, await TB calculations on\nother transition metals.) Our simulations show clearly that a description of the volumedependent d-band width by itself is not enough. The very large d-bonding energy Ed (V ) is\ndescribed by the very simple REP+VOL model, but we have shown that this always raises\nthe melting curve well above that of REP, and gives Tm (P ) predictions that agree poorly\nwith the actual melting curves of REP+TB. The melting curves are substantially reduced\nbelow those of REP+VOL by the rather small shifts of relative free energies of solid and\nliquid included in the full REP+TB model. We have seen that a significant contribution to\nthese shifts comes from the response of the system (particularly the liquid) to the presence\nof the TB energy.\nThe present work may shed light on recent interpretations of the flat melting curves\ninferred from DAC measurements. It has been proposed that the directional bonding associated with partially filled d-bands may give rise to \"preferred local structures\" having\nicosahedral short-range order in the liquid phase.62,63 It was suggested that the formation\nof these local structures lowers the free energy of the liquid, and hence depresses Tm . By\ncontrast with simpler models, such as the embedded-atom model, the TB model we use\n15\n\n\ffully includes directional d-bonding, and our simulated liquid would presumably exhibit the\neffects of \"preferred local structures\", if they were present. The same can be said of the\nDFT simulations that have been reported on Mo. Nevertheless, both the present TB calculations and the earlier DFT simulations give much steeper melting curves than the DAC\nmeasurements, and this indicates that the full inclusion of directional d-bonding does not\nlead to low melting curves, in contradiction with the suggestions of Refs. [62,63] .\nOur TB model represents only the d-band, and ignores the s \u2212 p band. This means that,\nalthough it mimics the pressure-dependent width of the d-band and gives the main features\nof the DOS, it cannot reproduce the fine details, since it neglects hybridization of d-states\nwith sp-states. It also means that the number of d-electrons Nd has to be treated as an\nadjustable parameter, and we do not include the dependence of this number on pressure or\nstructure. It has been suggested64 that the dependence of Nd on structure might lead to\nthe very flat melting curves inferred from DAC experiments. However, these ideas are not\nsupported by DFT simulations, which fully include structure-dependent sp-d transfer, but\nnevertheless give melting curves that rise much more steeply than those from DAC. The fact\nthat the present d-band-only TB models give melting curves in reasonable agreement with\nDFT confirms that sp-d transfer is not expected to give flat melting curves.\nA possible resolution of the conflict between shock and first-principles melting curves on\none side and DAC melting curves on the other side has emerged recently, at least for some\ntransition metals.21,26,65 DFT simulations of Mo have shown that, although bcc is the most\nstable structure at low T up to over 600 GPa, another structure, perhaps fcc or hcp, is likely\nto become more stable than bcc at much lower P and temperatures well below the melting\ncurve. The suggestion is that the transition interpreted as melting in DAC experiments on\nMo may actually be the transition between bcc and this other structure.\nOur main conclusions are as follows: A simple tight-binding model, parameterized using\ndata for the volume-dependent d-band width and the cold compression curve of Mo reproduces reasonably well the melting curve and the properties of high-P /high-T solid and liquid\nMo known from DFT simulations; the model allows us to analyse the physical mechanisms\nthat determine the melting properties, and to assess suggested explanations for the anomalously low melting curves inferred from static compression experiments. We hope to report\nsoon on TB calculations of melting properties across the whole 4d series.\n\n16\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThe work was supported by EPSRC-GB Grant No. EP/C534360, which is 50% funded\nby DSTL(MOD).
