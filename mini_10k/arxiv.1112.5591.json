The common\n1\n\n\fopinion, see Bell [1], is that this is impossible to do, but see [2]\u2013[14] for\nnumerous attempts to proceed with classical wave (oscillatory) prequantum\nmodels. The main argument is that for composite quantum systems (e.g., a\npair of entangled photons) the correlation predicted by QM (and confirmed\nby experiment [15]\u2013[17]) cannot be reproduced by models with (local) hidden variables. This is also the common opinion that \"Bell's theorem\" [1] is\nformulated in so general abstract framework that it rejects all (local) models\nwith hidden variables, including variables of classical field (e.g., electromagnetic) type. Although nowadays Bell's inequality and entangled systems are\nthe hot topics [18], [19], the problem of a possibility of the classical field\ndescription of a single quantum system is also of the large importance for\nquantum theory, including quantum information theory. One of the most\nimportant tests of a possibility to represent a photon simply as a pulse of\nclassical electromagnetic field is the experiment on coincidence detection in\ntwo output channels of the polarization beam splitter (PBS) [20], [21]. QM\npredicts that if the source can be considered as one-photon source, then the\nprobability of coincidence detection equals to zero: one photon cannot be\nsplit between two channels, it is either in one or another channel. Any pulse\nof the classical electromagnetic field is split between two output channels of\nPBS. Hence, the probability of coincidence detection is nonzero. Of course,\nthe real experimental situation is more complicated: for any \"one-photon\nsource\" the probability of emission of e.g. two photons is nonzero (although\nit can be made very small), there is also the contribution of noise, including\nso called duck counts (i.e., counts in detectors in the absence of the source).\nTherefore, instead of the absolute probability of coincidence detection P12 ,\nexperimenters use the relative probability [20], [21]:\ng (2) (0) =\n\nP12\n,\nP1 P2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P12 is the probability of coincidence detection in channels i = 1, 2 and\nPi are probabilities of detection in corresponding channels. Known (semi-)\nclassical models of QM predict that g (2) (0) \u2265 1. If photon is not a classical\npulse, one can expect that g (2) (0) < 1 (even by taking into account noise and\nemission of double photons). The first experiment of this type was performed\nby [20], see also [21] and [22] for review. It was shown that the number of\ndouble clicks is relatively small. This experiment played an important role\nin quantum foundations. As is commonly accepted, this experiment justified\nrejection of (semi-)classical field theories as \"prequantum theories\"; in particular, photons cannot be interpreted as pulses of classical electromagnetic\nfield.\nThe aim of this paper is to show that the main reason of dis-matching of\n2\n\n\fpredictions of (semi-)classical field models with QM and experimental data is\nthat such models do not take into account the impact of detectors to creation\nof the quantum statistics.\nWe present a classical field model which in combination with the procedure of detection of random signals by threshold type detectors (which are\nproperly calibrated) reproduces quantum probabilities and, in particular, the\ncoefficient g (2) (0) << 1 for a sufficiently high detection threshold Ed . Hence,\nthe prediction of our model differs crucially from the prediction of the known\nclassical field models which do not take into account the evident fact that\nmeasurement is not simply detection (of the monitoring-type) of continuous\nclassical signals, but creation of discrete counts with the aid of threshold\ndetectors. Detectors also have to be properly calibrated.\nOur model, threshold signal detection model (TSD), predicts that the\nquantum prediction, g (2) (0) << 1, matches better measurements for high\nvalue of the detection threshold. The basic prediction of TSD is that the\ncoefficient\nK\ng (2) (0) \u2264 2 ,\nEd\nwhere K > 0 is a constant depending on the signal. This K depends on the\nbrightness of the source: higher brightness implies larger K. It also depends\non elements of the density matrix \u03c1 = (\u03c1ij ) corresponding to the prequantum\nsignal. (In TSD \u03c1 corresponds to the normalization (by the trace) of the\ncovariance operator B of the prequantum random signal, i.e., \u03c1 = B/TrB.)\nLarger \u03c112 implies larger K.\nIt is interesting to compare this prediction with the real experiment. Unfortunately, it seems that Grangier's type experiments with detailed monitoring of dependence of the coincidence probability on the value of the threshold\nhave never been done; more specifically, that is: In Grangier's experiment,\ndid the calibration of detectors play a crucial role to eliminate coincidences?\nThis is clearly a crucial question. It is hard to give a definite answer\nas to how exactly it was influencing the result at a fundamental level because Grangier et al [20], [21] didn't study the influence of threshold on the\ng (2) (0) parameter he was measuring. It is nevertheless clear that with a lower\nthreshold, he would have gotten a less good result. Let me translate the part\nof Grangier's thesis [21] where he explains for the first time the role of the\nthreshold and how its level was chosen:\n\"[...] In this configuration, the threshold has a double role of acquisition\nof timing information and of selection of the pulses (the too weak pulses\nare not taken into account). The problems connected to the choice of the\ndiscriminator threshold and of the high voltage of the photomultipliers are\ndiscussed in detail in reference [15]. We have in the present experiment\n3\n\n\fchosen a rather high threshold, which amount to give the priority of the\nstability of the counting rates and the reproducibility of the results, rather\nthan to the global detection efficiencies.\" (I stressed with bold the important\nfact that Grangier proceeded with rather high threshold.)\nTSD provides a strong motivation to perform Grangier's type experiment\nwith monitoring of dependence of the coincidence probability on the detection\nthreshold and source's brightness.\nTSD can be considered as measurement theory for recently developed\nprequantum classical statistical field theory, PCSFT, [23],[24]. The latter reproduced all quantum averages and correlations including correlations for\nentangled quantum states. In particular, PCSFT correlations violated Bell's\ninequality. The main problem for matching of PCSFT and conventional QM\nwas that PCSFT (nor other classical field models) was not able to describe\nprobabilities of discrete clicks of detectors. In particular, PCSFT is theory\nof correlations of continuous signals. \"Prequantum observables\" are given\nby quadratic forms of signals. These forms are unbounded and this is not\nsurprising that correlations of such observables can violate Bell's type inequalities, see [25] for discussion and an elementary example. The condition\nof coincidence of ranges of values of quantum observables and corresponding\n\"prequantum variables\" plays a crucial role in Bell's argument. TSD solved\nthe measurement problem of PCSFT. In the same way as in Bell's consideration, TSD operates with discrete observables. In particular, in the case\nof photon polarization (its projection to a fixed axis) TSD operates with\ndichotomous variables taking values \u00b11.\nTSD/PCSFT for composite quantum systems was presented in [26]. However, random signals considered in [26] have a complex structure of temporal\ncorrelations, even in the case of a single system. In the present paper, we use\nsimply a combination of the Wiener process (as the career of temporal correlations) and a Gaussian stationary process valued in the space of internal\ndegrees of freedom of a quantum system (e.g., its polarization). We do not\nconsider spatial degrees of freedom.\nTo escape misunderstanding, we stress that the presented detection model\nis purely classical; in particular, detectors are classical detectors which are\nsensitive to the energy density of a signal in the domain of detection V. Such\na detector clicks at the first instance of time \u03c4 = \u03c4d when the total energy of\nsignal in V approaches the detection threshold Ed . Since we consider random\nsignals, this instant of detection is a random variable \u03c4 = \u03c4 (\u03c9). Our main\naim is to find its average \u03c4\u0304 . The quantity 1/\u03c4\u0304 determines the probability of\ndetection. At the moment we proceed with such an operational description\nof the classical detectors. We plan to consider a more detailed scheme of the\nclassical threshold detection in another paper in which we shall study classical\n4\n\n\fsignals with spatial degrees of freedom, i.e., signals in physical space-time.\n(In the present paper we restrict the model to \"internal degrees of freedom\"\nsuch as polarization. The model with spatial degrees of freedom is essentially\nmore complicated, since it involves processes with infinite-dimensional state\nspace.)\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThreshold detection\nThe class of random signals\n\nWe consider a special class of classical random signals. The model is phemenological: we cannot present physical motivations for selection of this\nclass of signals, besides the fact that detection of such signals with the aid\nof threshold type detectors reproduces the correct quantum probabilities.\nAnother class of classical random signals serving for the same aim was introduced in [26]. Signals considered in the present paper have essentially\nsimpler temporal structure, simply the Wiener process.\nStructurally our model has some similarity with the prequantum model\nof Gr\u00f6ssing et al [13]. Subquantum stochasticity is combined of the two\ncounterparts: a stationary process in the space of internal degrees of freedom\nand the randmom walk type motion describing the temporal dynamics.\nWe start with stationary signals. We proceed in the finite dimensional\nstate space corresponding to internal degrees of freedom such as polarization.\nGeneralization to spatial degrees of freedom is evident, but it has essentially\nmore complicated mathematical structure.\nLet H be the m dimensional complex Hilbert space. Let \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(\u03c9) be\nthe H-valued Gaussian random variable with zero average and the covariance operator B. This operator is Hermitian and positively defined. Take\nin H an orthonormal basis {ej } and consider corresponding signal's components \u03c6j (\u03c9) = h\u03c6(\u03c9), ej i. The mathematical\nP expansion of the random vector\n\u03c6(\u03c9) with respect to the basis \u03c6(\u03c9) = j \u03c6j (\u03c9)ej physically corresponds to\nsplitting of the signal into disjoint channels. We remark that correlations of\nsignal's components are given by\nE\u03c6i \u03c6j = hBei , ej i = bij .\nNow we introduce the temporal stochastics by simply using the one dimensional Wiener process w(t) which is independent from the stationary process \u03c6(\u03c9). Consider the random (non-stationary) signal \u03c6(t, \u03c9) = w(t)\u03c6(\u03c9)\nand its components corresponding to internal degrees of freedom: \u03c6j (t, \u03c9) =\n\n5\n\n\fw(t)\u03c6j (\u03c9). We remark that correlations of signal's components are given by\nE\u03c6i (t)\u03c6j (s) = min(t, s)bij .\nThe energy of the ith component of the complex signal \u03c6(t) (at the instance\nof time t) is given by the square of its absolute value\nEi (t, \u03c9) = |\u03c6i (t, \u03c9)|2.\nThe total energy of the signal is\nX\nEi (t, \u03c9) =\n|\u03c6i (t, \u03c9)|2 = k\u03c6(t, \u03c9)k2.\ni\n\n2.2\n\nThe scheme of threshold measurement\n\nWe consider the measurement scheme in which each channel, i = 1, 2, ...m,\ngoes to a threshold type detector. We assume that all detectors have the same\nthreshold Ed > 0. The detection procedure under consideration is reduced to\nthe condition of the energy level approaching the detection threshold. The\ninstant of time \u03c4 corresponding to the signal's detection (\"click\") by jth\ndetector is determined by the condition:\nEj (\u03c4, \u03c9) = Ed .\n\n(2)\n\nWe remark that the instant of the signal detection is a random variable:\n\u03c4 = \u03c4 (\u03c9).\nMathematically our aim is to find average of the instance of detection, \u03c4\u0304 =\nE\u03c4. The quantity 1/\u03c4\u0304 will be used to find the probability of detection, \"how\noften the detector produces clicks,\" see section 3.\nWe apply the mathematical expectation (average) operator to both sides\nof the detection condition (2) and we obtain\nEEj (\u03c4 (\u03c9), \u03c9) = Ed ,\n\n(3)\n\nEw 2 (\u03c4 (\u03c9), \u03c9)E|\u03c6j (\u03c9)|2 = Ed .\n\n(4)\n\nor\nTo find the first average, we use the formula of total probability:\nZ \u221e\n2\nEw (\u03c4 (\u03c9), \u03c9) =\nd\u03c4 P (\u03c4 (\u03c9) = \u03c4 )Ew 2 (\u03c4, \u03c9).\n0\n\n6\n\n\fWe know that, for the fixed \u03c4, Ew 2 (\u03c4, \u03c9) = \u03c4. Hence,\nZ \u221e\n2\nEw (\u03c4 (\u03c9), \u03c9) =\nd\u03c4 P (\u03c4 (\u03c9) = \u03c4 )\u03c4 = E\u03c4 \u2261 \u03c4\u0304 .\n0\n\nThus, the detection condition (4) has the form:\n\u03c4\u0304 E|\u03c6j (\u03c9)|2 = Ed ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c4\u0304 bii = Ed .\n\n(6)\n\nor\nWe remark that \u03c4 = \u03c4i , i = 1, 2, ..., m.

(The normalization\nproblem is typically ignored in standard books on quantum foundations,\ncf., however, [25].) In QM-experiments probabilities are obtained through\nnormalization corresponding to the sum of clicks in all detectors involved in\nthe experiment, e.g., spin up and spin down detectors.\nHence, the total number of clicks:\nP\nX\nT i bii\nT TrB\nNi =\nN=\n=\n.\n(9)\nEd\nEd\ni\nWe remark that the total number of clicks does not depend on the split of\nthe signal into disjoint channels, i.e., on the selection of an orthonormal basis\n{ej } in H. In fact,\nEk\u03c6(\u03c9)k2 = TrB.\nThe probability of detection for the jth detector is given by\nPi = Ni /N =\n7\n\nbii\n.\nTrB\n\n(10)\n\n\fIn fact, this is the Born's rule of QM. Consider the operator\n\u03c1 = B/TrB.\n\n(11)\n\nThis is the Hermitian positive trace one operator; so it has all properties of\nthe density operator used in QM to describe the state of a quantum system.\nbi = |ei ihei |, the orthogonal projection onto the vector ei . Then the\nSet C\nequality for the probability of detection (10) can be written as\nb i.\nPi = Tr\u03c1C\n\n(12)\n\nThis is the QM-rule for calculation of probabilities of detection.\n\n4\n\nCoincidence detection\n\nCoincidence of clicks corresponds to matching of two conditions of threshold\napproaching corresponds to two constraints:\nE1 (\u03c41 (\u03c9), \u03c9) = Ed , E2(\u03c42 (\u03c9), \u03c9) = Ed = Ed ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere matching has the form\n\u03c41 (\u03c9) = \u03c42 (\u03c9) = \u03c4 (\u03c9).\n\n(14)\n\nOur aim is to estimate the probability of coincidence P12 . To shorter notatin,\nwe set Ei (\u03c9) \u2261 Ei (\u03c4 (\u03c9); \u03c9) or even simply \u0393i , i = 1, 2.\nWe consider the set of random parameters corresponding to coincidence\ndetection: A12 = {\u03c9 : Ei = Ed , i = 1, 2}. (A12 is the event of coincidence\ndetection). We have to estimate its probability, P12 = P (A12 )). We shall get\na rather rough estimate which, nevertheless, will be sufficient for our purpose.\nHowever, we shall see that better estimates of this probability will clarify\nessentially inter-relation between our \"prequantum classical field theory\",\nQM, and experiment. In principle, one may hope to derive an approximative\nexpression for P12 as we did for probabilities Pj , j = 1, 2. However, this is a\ncomplicated probabilistic problem.\nWe remark that A12 is a subset of the set\nA1\u00d72 = {\u03c9 : E1 E2 = Ed2 }.\nHence, P (A12 ) \u2264 P (A1\u00d72 ). And the set A1\u00d72 is a subset of the set\nA1\u00d72\u2265Ed2 = {\u03c9 : E1 E2 \u2265 Ed2 }\n8\n\n\fand hence P (A12 ) \u2264 P (A1\u00d72\u2265Ed2 ). The latter probability we can (roughly)\nestimate by using Chebyshov inequality (which usage is standard for such\nestimates, cf. [27]). In the simplest form, for a random variable u = u(\u03c9)\nand a constant k > 0, this inequality has the form: P (\u03c9 : u \u2265 k) \u2264 E|u(\u03c9)|\n.\nk\nIn our case u = E1 E2 , k = Ed2 . We have\nP (A12 ) \u2264\n\nEE1 E2\n.\nEd2\n\n(15)\n\nWe find this average by using the formula of total probability [?], [27]:\nZ \u221e\nEE1 (\u03c9)E2(\u03c9) =\nEE1 (\u03c4, \u03c9)E2(\u03c4, \u03c9)P (\u03c4 (\u03c9) = \u03c4 )d\u03c4.\n(16)\n0\n\nThus our main problem is to find the correlation of two energies for each\ninstant of time \u03c4. We have\nEE1 (\u03c4, \u03c9)E2(\u03c4, \u03c9) = Ew 4(\u03c4 )E|\u03c61 (\u03c9)|2|\u03c62 (\u03c9)|2.\nThe first factor is known, Ew 4 (\u03c4 ) = 3\u03c4 2 .\nTo find the second factor, we shall use general theory of Gaussian integrals\non complex Hilbert space [28], see appendix.

By (11) we can rewrite this answer in terms of quantum\nmechanical density matrix\nEE1 (\u03c4 (\u03c9); \u03c9)E2(\u03c4 (\u03c9); \u03c9) = 3\u03c4 2 TrB(\u03c1ii \u03c1jj + |\u03c1ij |2 ),\nThus by the Chebyshov inequality\nP (A12 ) \u2264\n\n3TrB\u03c4 2\n(\u03c1ii \u03c1jj + |\u03c1ij |2 ).\nEd2\n\nThe quantity\n\u2206\u2261\n\np\n\n\u03c42\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\ncan be interpreted as the time parameter scaling the time intervals between\ncoincidence clicks.

Consider a \u03c3-additive Gaussian measure\np on the \u03c3-field of Borel subsets of W. This measure is determined by its\ncovariance operator B : W \u2192 W and mean value m \u2208 W. For example, B\nand m determine the Fourier transform of p :\nZ\n1\np\u0303(y) =\nei(y,\u03c6) dp(\u03c6) = e 2 (By,y)+i(m,y) , y \u2208 W.\nW\n\n(In probability theory it is called the characteristic functional of the probability distribution p.) In what follows we restrict Rour considerations to\nGaussian measures with zero mean value: (m, y) = W (y, \u03c8)dp(\u03c8) = 0 for\nany y \u2208 W. Sometimes there will be used the symbol pB to denote the\nGaussian measure with the covariance operator B and m = 0. We recall\nthat\nthe covariance operator B is defined by its bilinear form (By1 , y2 ) =\nR\n(y1 , \u03c6)(y2, \u03c6)dp(\u03c6), y1, y2 \u2208 W\nLet Q and P be two copies of a real Hilbert space. Let us consider their\nCartesian product\n\u0013 \u00d7 P, \"phase space,\" endowed with the symplectic\n\u0012 H =Q\n0\n1\n. Consider the class of Gaussian measures (with\noperator J =\n\u22121 0\nzero mean value) which are invariant with respect to the action of the operator J; denote this class S(H). It is easy to show that p \u2208 S(H) if and only\nif its covariance operator commutes with the symplectic operator, [23].\nAs always, we consider complexification of H (which will be denoted by\nthe same symbol), H = Q \u2295 iP. The complex scalar product is denoted by\nthe symbol h*, *i. The space of bounded Hermitian operators acting in H is\ndenoted by the symbol Ls (H).\nWe introduce the complex covariance Roperator of a measure p on the\ncomplex Hilbert space H : hDy1, y2 i = H hy1 , \u03c6ih\u03c6, y2idp(\u03c6). Let p be a\nmeasure on the Cartesian product H1 \u00d7 H2 of two complex Hilbert spaces.\nThen its covariance operator has the block structure\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD11 D12\nD=\n,\n(24)\nD21 D22\nwhere Dii : Hi \u2192 Hi and Dij : Hj \u2192 Hi .
