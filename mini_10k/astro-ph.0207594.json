The variations are correlated with the previously\nreported \u2248 400 d variations in the X-ray flux of 4U 1700+24, which supports the association of these two\nobjects, as well as the identification of this system as the second known X-ray binary in which a neutron\nstar accretes from the wind of a red giant. The HD 154791 radial velocity variations can be fit with an\neccentric orbit with period 404 \u00b1 3 d, amplitude K = 0.75 \u00b1 0.12 km s\u22121 and eccentricity e = 0.26 \u00b1 0.15.\nThere are also indications of variations on longer time scales & 2000 d. We have re-examined all\navailable ASM data following an unusually large X-ray outburst in 1997\u201398, and confirm that the 1-d\naveraged 2\u201310 keV X-ray flux from 4U 1700+24 is modulated with a period of 400 \u00b1 20 d.

If the 400-d oscillations from\nHD 154791/4U 1700+24 are due to orbital motion, then the system parameters are probably close to\nthose of the only other neutron-star symbiotic-like binary, GX 1+4. We discuss the similarities and\ndifferences between these two systems.\nSubject headings: binaries: symbiotic - X-rays: binaries - stars: neutron\n8th magnitude M2 III star HD 154791. In a recent reanalysis of ROSAT HRI data, however, Morgan & Garcia (2001) found only a 10% chance that the two sources\nare associated, but did not propose an alternative candidate. Previous optical spectroscopy ruled out radial velocity variations with amplitudes greater than 5 km s\u22121\non time scales of 40 min to \u223c 1 yr (Garcia et al. 1983),\nstrongly suggesting that either the orbital period is significantly longer than one year, or that the system is viewed\nvery close to face-on (inclination angle i \u2248 0).\nHD 154791 may be only the second symbiotic-like binary\nknown to contain a neutron star, after the well-studied\nM-giant/X-ray pulsar system V2116 Oph/GX 1+4. However, these systems are quite different in X-rays (Table 1).\nFurthermore, the optical spectrum of V2116 Oph exhibits\nextremely strong, variable emission lines, probably powered by UV photons originating from an accretion disk\n(Chakrabarty & Roche 1997). In contrast, HD 154791 has\nmuch weaker line emission. In fact, optically the spectrum\nis very close to that of an isolated M giant (e.g. Garcia\net al. 1983).\nHere we describe optical and X-ray observations\nwhich go some way towards resolving the uncertainties surrounding this system.\nWe compare the\nproperties of HD 154791/4U 1700+24 with those of\nV2116 Oph/GX 1+4, and discuss what may be inferred\nabout the former in light of our results.\n\n1. introduction\n\nThe X-ray source 4U 1700+24 (also known as 2A\n1704+241; l = 45.\u25e6 15, b = 32.\u25e6 99) was first discovered\nin Ariel V scans for high-latitude X-ray sources (Cooke\net al. 1978), and by the U huru (SAS A) X-ray observatory (Forman et al. 1978). It has a typical flux of (1\u2013\n10) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (2\u201310 keV, equivalent to 0.5\u2013\n5 mCrab as measured by a range of X-ray missions;\nMasetti et al. 2002), and experiences occasional outbursts.\nDuring a 100-d X-ray high state in 1997\u201398, 4U 1700+24\nwas observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE;\nJahoda et al. 1996). This high state was the larger of two\nknown outbursts of this system, and the X-ray flux reached\na peak of 40 mCrab. The X-ray spectrum of 4U 1700+24\nis similar to that of other accreting neutron stars, and\ngenerally requires a blackbody with a temperature of 0.9\u2013\n1.3 keV plus a hard component at higher energies for an\nacceptable fit. The X-ray spectral hardness and the lack\nof UV continuum imply that the compact object is almost\ncertainly not a white dwarf (Garcia et al. 1983). A black\nhole companion is also unlikely since the thermal X-ray\ncomponent in black hole candidates is typically an order\nof magnitude lower in temperature than that measured in\n4U 1700+24. However, no rapid quasi-periodic or coherent X-ray variations have been confirmed (Masetti et al.\n2002), which is rather unusual for an accreting neutron\nstar.\nBased on Einstein position measurements, Garcia et al.\n(1983) proposed the association of 4U 1700+24 with the\n1\n\n\fRadial velocity (km s \u22121)\n\n2\n\nGalloway et al.\n\nTime (MJD)\n\nOrbital phase\n\nFig. 1.- Radial velocity measurements of HD 154791 and the\ncorresponding 404 \u00b1 3 d orbital solution. The top panel shows the\nradial velocity measurements versus time and the estimated 1\u03c3 uncertainties. The bottom panel shows the measurements folded on\nthe orbital period. In both panels the eccentric orbital model is\noverplotted as a solid line (see Table 2).\n\n2. observations\n\n2.1. Radial velocity variations\nEchelle spectra of HD 154791 were obtained using intensified Reticon detectors on the 1.5-m Tillinghast Reflector\nat the Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona,\nand also the 1.5-m Wyeth reflector at Oak Ridge Observatory, Massachusetts. The observations were made between\n1982 April 12 and 1996 October 26, with the 18 observations before 1992 October 7 taken at Mt. Hopkins, and\nthose since taken at Oak Ridge. The instruments are described in detail by Latham (1992). The spectra cover a\n44 \u00c5 bandpass centered around 5200 \u00c5, with a resolution\nof approximately 8.5 km s\u22121 . Each observation consisted\nof a 10\u201320 minute integration of HD 154791, with 90 s\nTh-Ar comparison scans before and after. The positions\nof around 30 strong spectral lines in each calibration scan\nwere fit with a fifth-order polynomial, and the pre- and\npost-observation scans were then combined to calibrate\nthe wavelength scale for each spectrum. Typical residuals to the polynomial fit were 0.5 pixel, corresponding to\n0.01 \u00c5, or 0.5 km s\u22121 . Approximately 25 lines were common to the entire set of wavelength solutions. The radial\nvelocity was measured by cross-correlating each observed\nspectrum with an M-star template spectrum (e.g. Tonry\n& Davis 1979) and measuring the mean offset. Quadratic\nleast-squares fits to the peak in the cross-correlation function give a radial velocity accurate to better than 1 km s\u22121 .\nThe radial velocity measurements show significant variations of approximately 1 km s\u22121 about the mean systemic velocity of \u221248.7 \u00b1 0.1 km s\u22121 (Figure 1). We\nsearched the data for periodic signals in the range 50\u2013\n1000 d by calculating the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (e.g.\nPress et al. 1996), and found a marginally significant peak\nnear a period of 410 d (Lomb-normalized power 10.5; estimated significance from bootstrap simulations, 3.3\u03c3). Fitting an elliptical orbit to the data gave a solution with\norbital period 404 \u00b1 3 d and radial velocity amplitude\nK = 0.75 \u00b1 0.12 km s\u22121 (Table 2; solid lines in Figure\n1). The reduced-\u03c72 (\u03c72\u03bd ) for the fit was 1.26, indicating a\n\nmarginally acceptable fit. While the best-fit eccentricity\nwas 0.26, the deviations from circularity were significant\nat less than the 2\u03c3 level.\nThere was also evidence for variations in the radial velocity on longer time scales. We calculated \u03c72\u03bd for an eccentric orbit as a function of trial period for periods up to\n4000 d. While the 404 d signal gave rise to a \u03c72\u03bd value close\nto 1, lower values were achieved at substantially longer\nperiods around 1930 d (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.04), 2370 d (1.02) and\n3700 d (0.91). The irregular spacing of the measurements\ndid not allow us to distinguish clearly between these periodicities; eccentric orbital solutions with any one of the\nthree periods can account for the long-term radial velocity variations. The observations do not cover more than\none full cycle for these longer-period signals, so more observations are needed to determine whether they are true\nperiodic variations or aperiodic trends related to irregular\nred-giant variability.\n2.2. RXTE/ASM observations\nMasetti et al. (2002) noted tentative evidence for an\napproximately 400 d periodicity in RXTE All-Sky Monitor (ASM) data. To investigate the 400-d periodicity, we obtained 1-d averaged ASM measurements of\n4U 1700+24 between 1996 January 5 and 2002 April\n18 (MJD 50087\u201352382) from the ASM WWW site at\nhttp://xte.mit.edu. The mean quiescent ASM count\nrate was 0.2 count s\u22121 . During the flare observed between\n1997 September\u2013December (MJD 50700\u201350800), the 1-d\naveraged rate reached 2.5 count s\u22121 (Figure 2, top panel).\nTo avoid a biased period measurement due to the presence of the 1997\u201398 outburst, we initially calculated a\nLomb-normalized periodogram over the interval from the\nend of the outburst (around 1998 March 28) to 2002 April\n18. The result was a peak with Lomb-normalized power\n14.05 (equivalent to 3.9\u03c3), at 383 \u00b1 30 d. We estimated\nthe period uncertainty by folding the ASM data on the\ndetected period, and calculating 1000 sets of statistically\nequivalent data sets with the same time sampling, average profile and noise properties per bin as measured in\nthe original data set. The variance in the detection periods of the simulated data sets is then a measure of the\nuncertainty in the actual detection.\nTo obtain a more precise estimate of the quiescent Xray periodicity, we excluded those measurements with errors of > 0.5 count s\u22121 . Around 13% of the 1-d averaged\nASM measurements had errors above this threshold, possibly due to source variability on time scales less than a\nday, but more likely arising from low-significance detections due to solar contamination or other sub-optimal observing conditions. These low-significance measurements\nappeared to introduce a bias to the period measurements,\nand also tended to contribute disproportionately to the\nestimated uncertainty in the period. A Lomb-normalized\nperiodogram calculated on this subset of data following\nthe outburst resulted in a peak power of 24.04 (estimated\nsignificance 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 , equivalent to 5.5\u03c3) at 392 \u00b1 14 d.\nTo confirm the above results, we used the phase-dispersion\nminimization technique of Stellingwerf (1978) and folded\nthe ASM light curve on a grid of periods between 200 to\n1000 d. We found that the X-ray flux was most likely modulated with a period of 404 \u00b1 13 d. Combining the results\n\n\f3. discussion\n\nWe have found evidence for significant variation in the\nradial velocity measurements from HD 154791, which we\nfit with an eccentric orbit with period 404 \u00b1 3 d. We\nhave also found evidence for a significant variation in the\nX-ray flux from 4U 1700+24. Our best estimate of the\nX-ray period is 400 \u00b1 20 d. Hence, the periods measured\nfrom the radial velocity and ASM X-ray flux variations\nare consistent. It is compelling to suggest that these two\nperiodicities arise from a common source. Naturally, it\nis also possible that the agreement between the two periodicities is merely coincidence, and that HD 154791 and\n4U 1700+24 are unrelated. Estimating the probability of\nsuch a coincidence depends upon the origin of the periodicities in each star, as well as the intrinsic distributions of\nthese phenomena. In practice, it is not possible to make\nsuch an estimate with much confidence. However, it is\nclear that the likelihood of an unrelated red giant and Xray source being at nearly the same measured position at\nhigh galactic latitude, and also both having a periodicity\n\nASM count rate\n\nTime (MJD)\n\nLomb normalised power\n\nfrom the latter two period-search techniques, we determine\nthe period of the X-ray oscillation to be 400 \u00b1 20 d with\nthe epoch of maximum at MJD 51140 \u00b1 10 d. The mean\nprofile of the post-outburst ASM measurements folded on\nthe 400 d period is also shown in Figure 2 (inset, bottom\npanel). The profile was approximately sinusoidal with an\namplitude of 0.108 \u00b1 0.012 ASM count s\u22121 , or 31% rms.\nWith the periastron time from the orbital fit used as a reference phase for the fold, we find that on average the X-ray\nmaximum occurs 0.1 in phase (\u223c 40 d) after periastron.\nFor comparison, we also calculated an oversampled\nLomb-normalized periodogram of the entire ASM data set\n(including the 1997\u201398 outburst), which revealed a significant periodicity at 383 d (identical to that measured\nfollowing the outburst). The 1997\u201398 outburst was unusual; no similar events were observed by the ASM in\n\u2248 6.5 yr of monitoring. Thus, it may have occurred due\nto a mechanism distinct to some extent from the periodic\nbehavior of the quiescent emission. Furthermore, there\nis evidence that the behaviour of the persistent emission\nprior to the outburst was different than afterwards. Although only a little more than one 400-d interval was covered before the outburst, the persistent flux was weakly\nanticorrelated compared to the mean profile measured following the outburst. Applying the same error threshold\n(\u03c3 < 0.5 count s\u22121 ) to the full data set resulted in an\nincrease in both the peak power and period, to 51.1 (estimated significance 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221220 or > 8\u03c3) at 385 d. The\nshorter measured periods using the full ASM data set may\nbe attributed to aliasing resulting from a delay between the\nnearest phase of X-ray maximum for the persistent emission and the peak of the 1997\u201398 outburst. If 4U 1700+24\nis similar to wind-accreting neutron stars in high-mass\nbinaries, we may expect large outbursts to correspond\nonly approximately with periastron phase (e.g. Stella et al.\n1986). In fact, the peak of the 1997 outburst falls around\nMJD 50780, approximately 40 d after the nearest epoch\nof maximum flux according to the 400-d periodicity detected in the post-1997 outburst ASM measurements, and\napproximately 70 days after periastron passage according\nto the orbital solution discussed in \u00a72.1 (Figure 2).\n\nASM count rate\n\n3\n\nPhase\n\nTrial Period (days)\nFig. 2.- RXTE/ASM measurements of 4U 1700+24.

The inset shows the folded ASM profile using the time of\nperiastron from the orbital fit as the reference phase.\n\nthat would be unusual for either type of source separately,\nis extremely small. The detection of a 400-d modulation\nfrom both stars therefore supports the original suggestion\nthat HD 154791 is the optical counterpart of 4U 1700+24.\n3.1. Cause of the Correlation\nThere are several plausible mechanisms for a correspondence between the radial velocity and the persistent X-ray\nflux. We consider two possibilities for the origin of the 404d period in the HD 154791 radial velocity curve: orbital\nmotion, and pulsational variation of the M-giant. Precise\noptical photometric monitoring could distinguish between\nthese two possibilities, since the maximum brightness occurring at any phase besides that of maximum recessional\nvelocity would favour orbital motion.\nIf the radial velocity variations are due to orbital motion,\nthe 400-d X-ray flux modulation may arise from changes\nin the accretion rate onto the neutron star as it follows an\nelliptical orbit around the companion and moves through\ndifferent nebular densities. Such modulation is common in\nhigh-mass wind-accreting X-ray binaries (e.g. Stella et al.\n1986). Moreover, the times of periastron passage in our\nbest-fit orbital model are very well correlated with the\ntimes of increased X-ray flux. For a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star\n\n\f4\n\nGalloway et al.\n\nand red giant mass . 2.5 M\u2299 , the 404 d period and low\namplitude of the radial velocity variations imply that the\ninclination is i . 2\u25e6 . Although the a priori probability of\nobserving such a system is . 7 \u00d7 10\u22124 , such a low inclination could explain the lack of X-ray pulsations or QPOs\nfrom the source (see \u00a73.2). If the 400-d variation is in fact\ndue to orbital motion, the longer-term variations in the\nradial velocities may be related to irregular variations in\nthe red giant (Percy et al. 2001).\nAlternatively, red-giant pulsations with P = 400 d could\nmodulate the stellar wind, and hence the accretion rate\nonto the neutron star. The IRAS fluxes of HD 154791\n(f12 = 2.77, f25 = 0.736, f60 < 0.4, f100 < 1.0, where\nf12 is the flux density f\u03bd at 12 microns in Jy) indicate\nthat is it not a Mira variable (Kenyon et al. 1988). However, non-Mira M-giants also pulsate. Although typical\nfundamental pulsation periods lie in the range 20\u2013200 d,\nvariations with a period up to an order of magnitude larger\nare also seen (Percy et al. 2001). If the 400-d variations\nare due to pulsation, one of the slower trends observed in\nthe radial velocity variations could be related to orbital\nmotion. In this case, the possible range of orbital inclinations becomes much more likely. An orbital period of\n2370 d gives an inclination of 4\u20136\u25e6 while for a period of\n3700 d the likely range is 5\u20137\u25e6 . Also, the low accretion rate\nonto the neutron star would be more understandable if the\norbital period is longer than 400 d. However, a longer orbital period alone cannot account for the discrepancy in\nluminosity between 4U 1700+24 and GX 1+4.\nFinally, the shape of the 400-d radial velocity variation\nargues against a red-giant pulsation. Pulsation light curves\nare typically non-sinusoidal (in the sense that more time is\nspent with brightness below the median value than above\nit), and similar behavior would be expected for the radial\nvelocity variations.\n3.2. Comparison with GX 1+4\nIf the 400 d periodicity in the HD 154791 radial velocities is due to orbital motion, then the orbital periods of\nHD 154791/4U 1700+24 and GX 1+4 may be quite similar\n(see Table 1). This similarity makes the contrast between\ntheir other observed properties puzzling. The X-ray luminosity of GX 1+4 appears to be two to three orders of\nmagnitude greater than that of 4U 1700+24. In GX 1+4,\nthere is clear evidence for an accretion disk (Chakrabarty\n& Roche 1997), whereas in 4U 1700+24 there is no measurable UV continuum (Garcia et al. 1983). GX 1+4 has a\nrich optical emission-line spectrum, and HD 154791 shows\nvery little in the way of emission lines. Finally, GX 1+4\nis a 2-minute X-ray pulsar, whereas no coherent or quasiperiod oscillations have been convincingly detected from\n4U 1700+24.\nOne explanation for the differing X-ray luminosities is a\nlarger mass-loss rate from the late-type giant in GX 1+4.\nChakrabarty & Roche (1997) find that the M6 giant in\nGX 1+4 is probably near the tip of the first-ascent redgiant branch. HD 154791 has a spectral type M2, and so\nwould be expected to be losing mass at a lower rate. The\nrelative lack of optical/UV emission lines suggests that\neither the ionized nebula in HD 154791/4U 1700+24 is\nsubstantially smaller and/or less dense than in GX 1+4,\nor there are not enough UV photons to power nebular line\n\nemission in 4U 1700+24/HD 154791. Either of these conditions can plausibly arise if the mass loss from the companion is much smaller. Moreover, if the binary separation\nis smaller in GX 1+4 than in 4U 1700+24/HD 154791 a\nlarger fraction of the red giant wind could be accreted.\nThe higher X-ray luminosity in GX 1+4 could also illuminate the red giant and increase the mass loss from the red\ngiant further, in a sense producing a feedback effect. The\nobserved variability of the optical spectrum of V2116 Oph\nis evidence for the significant role played by X-ray heating.\nOn the other hand, in 4U 1700+24/HD 154791 the X-ray\nluminosity is perhaps low enough that very little illumination of the red giant or enhanced mass loss is expected.\nEven during the 1997 X-ray outburst, Tomasella et al.\n(1997) note that the optical spectrum was unchanged.\nFinally, the lack of pulsations or QPOs in 4U 1700+24\nremains puzzling. Garcia et al. (1983) and Morgan &\nGarcia (2001) proposed a 900-s QPO, but this QPO was\nnot confirmed in high-quality RXTE data (Masetti et al.\n2002). High-precision optical photometry has also revealed\na lack of pulsations (down to a limit of 0.5% fractional\nvariation), or rapid variations of any kind (Sokoloski et al.\n2001). This behavior is again in contrast to GX 1+4,\nwhere Jablonski et al. (1997) find an oscillation in the optical emission with an amplitude of from 0.4 to 4.5%, plus\nstochastic variations. Given that the optical light from\nGX 1+4 has a significant contribution from an accretion\ndisk, the lack of rapid optical variations from HD 154791\nprovides evidence that any contribution from a disk in\n4U 1700+24 is negligible in the optical regime as well as\nthe UV regime. The lack of X-ray pulsations is expected if\nthe 400-d radial velocity variations are due to orbital motion. As discussed in \u00a73.1, the low amplitude of the radial\nvelocity variations requires i \u223c 0, in which case any magnetic hot spots on the neutron star will be continuously in\nview (assuming the NS spin axis is aligned with angular\nmomentum axis of the binary). For higher and a priori\nmore probable values of i, the non-detection of pulsations\nmay be explained if the accretion flow is not appreciably\ndisrupted by the magnetic field of the neutron star above\nthe surface (e.g. Ghosh & Lamb 1979a,b), and spreads the\naccreting material more or less evenly over the neutron\nstar surface. Given the extremely low luminosity (and\nhence accretion rate) of this source, standard calculations\nof ram and B-field pressure balance would require that\nthe surface magnetic field strength of the neutron star be\n. 106 G, far below the canonical value for low-mass X-ray\nbinaries or even old neutron stars in recycled ms pulsars.\nA more likely scenario consistent with larger i is that the\nneutron star spin is very slow.\nIn conclusion, all scenarios for 4U 1700+24/HD 154791\nhave some difficulties. We have presented some options,\nbut more observational constraints are needed to select beween them. Additional observations to determine whether\nthe 400-d radial velocity variations are due to orbital motion or red-giant pulsation would also enable one to better\ninterpret the differences between 4U 1700+24/HD 154791\nand GX 1+4.\nWe are grateful to Dave Latham and Robert Stefanik\nfor their assistance with the data from the Wyeth telescope, and to Phil Uttley and Deepto Chakrabarty for\n\n\f5\nuseful discussions.
