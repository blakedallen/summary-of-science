INTRODUCTION\n\nEarly type galaxies are observed to obey many scaling\nrelations between their structural and spectral properties. Early work identified a number of one-dimensional\nrelations, including a color-magnitude relation (Faber\n1973; Sandage & Visvanathan 1978; Bower et al. 1992),\ncolor-line strength relations (Faber 1973), the FaberJackson relation between galaxy luminosity (L) and velocity dispersion (\u03c3) (Faber & Jackson 1976), variations\nin galaxy mass-to-light ratio (M/L) versus L (Tinsley\n1981; Faber et al. 1987), and various correlations of \u03c3 and\nL with galaxy effective radius (Re ) and effective surface\nbrightness (\u03bce ) (Kormendy 1985), or with galaxy core\nradius (rc ) and central surface brightness (I0 ) (Lauer\n1985). It is clear however that early type galaxies actually comprise at least a two-parameter population in\nterms of their structure, as represented by the Fundamental Plane (FP) relation (Djorgovski & Davis 1987;\nDressler et al. 1987). Projections of the FP appear narrow in some orientations, leading to the seemingly onedimensional relations listed above.\nIn comparison to structure, our understanding of the\nstellar population scaling laws is less well developed and\nhas primarily focused on one-dimensional relations, despite the evidence that early type galaxies form a twoparameter population, at least structurally. The stellar\npopulations of early type galaxies are known to vary with\ngalaxy \"size\", where size is typically parameterized as\neither \u03c3 or L, but sometimes also as stellar mass (M\u2217 ).\nSuch relations include the color-magnitude and color-\u03c3\n1 UCO/Lick Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064\n2 Gemini Observatory, 670 N. A'ohoku Place, Hilo, HI 96720\n\nrelations (where it is assumed that the galaxy color is\nindicative of its stellar population) as well as absorption\nline strength-\u03c3 relations (e.g., Burstein et al. 1984; Bender et al. 1993; Trager et al. 1998; Colless et al. 1999;\nKuntschner et al. 2001; Bernardi et al. 2003b), which\ngive potentially more detailed information about the stellar populations than do broad-band colors. In general,\ncolors are observed to redden and metal line strengths to\nincrease with increasing \u03c3 or L.\nThe question of whether these variations are due primarily to variations in metallicity, or whether age variations may also play a role was first posed by Faber (1973)\nand is still debated in the literature. The age-metallicity\ndegeneracy is such that differences in population age\nand differences in population metallicity affect colors and\nmetal absorption lines in nearly indistinguishable ways.\nThis can be loosely quantified by the \"3/2\" rule, that a\nfractional change in metallicity is roughly equivalent to\na 1.5 times larger fractional change in age in terms of its\neffect on colors and metal lines (Worthey 1994). Many\nauthors (e.g., Bower et al. 1992; Kodama & Arimoto\n1997) have since claimed that the color-magnitude relation is driven primarily by metallicity variations rather\nthan age variations, although Faber et al. (1995) argued\nthat age effects were also important. Recently, Gallazzi\net al. (2006) showed that galaxy metallicities increase\nby 100% along the red sequence, while ages increase by\nonly 50%. Applying the 3/2 rule, metallicity variations\nshould therefore account for \u223c 75% of the observed color\nvariation along the color-magnitude relation, while age\nvariation provides the remaining \u223c 25%.\nOther recent work studying stellar population trends\nwith \u03c3 (rather than L) have demonstrated age variations\nwith \u03c3 that should make larger contributions to the color\n\n\f2\n\nGraves et al.\n\nvariation. Applying the 3/2 rule to these studies, age\nappears to contribute from \u223c 33% (Thomas et al. 2005;\nGraves et al. 2007) to \u223c 40% (Trager et al. 2000; Nelan\net al. 2005; Smith et al. 2007a) of the observed color\nvariation along the color-\u03c3 relation.\nIn this paper, we tackle these subtle differences headon, comparing the color-magnitude and color-\u03c3 relations\ndirectly. We explore in detail the related stellar population variations, focusing on age, metallicity, and abundance ratio variations with \u03c3 and separately with L. We\nthen look at how stellar populations correlate with residuals from the mean \u03c3-L relation. This analysis explains\nhow these systematic residual relations conspire to produce the similar yet subtly and confusingly different observed trends with \u03c3 and L.\nThis is the first in a series of papers presenting a detailed exploration of stellar population properties of quiescent (non-star forming) galaxies, as well as the dependence of these properties on the structural parameters\nof the galaxies. The ultimate goal is to match up information about the star formation histories of quiescent\ngalaxies (derived from stellar population analysis) to the\nmass assembly and structural evolution of these galaxies\n(as inferred from galaxy structure and morphology). We\nuse a sample of \u223c16,000 quiescent galaxies from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS), stacking dozens or hundreds\nof similar galaxies to get very high signal-to-noise (S/N )\nspectra for detailed and accurate stellar population work.\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we differentiate between\n\"global variables\", which we use to identify similar galaxies for stacking, and \"stellar population variables\", which\nare the mean ages, metal abundances, and abundance ratios derived from the stacked spectra.\nThis first paper focuses on the color-magnitude and\ncolor-\u03c3 relations of quiescent galaxies; the global variables considered are therefore \u03c3, L, and color3. The goal\nis to understand where these relations come from, what\ncauses scatter around the relations, and how and why the\ncolor-magnitude and color-\u03c3 relations differ from one another. The color-magnitude relation is a natural place to\nbegin this series of papers, as it is the most accepted\nand most widely used of the early type galaxy scaling\nlaws, to the extent that it is even sometimes used to\nidentify galaxy clusters in photometric surveys where no\nredshifts are available (e.g., Gladders & Yee 2000). The\nstellar population variables presented here include mean\nstellar age, total Fe abundance ([Fe/H]), total Mg abundance ([Mg/H]), and the relative abundance ratio of Mg\nand Fe ([Mg/Fe]).\nMuch work has already been done on these topics and\nnot all of the results presented in this paper are new.\nHowever, the origin of the color-magnitude relation is\nfundamental to understanding the formation and evolution of early type galaxies, yet as discussed above, there\nis considerable confusion in the literature as to how the\nvarious scaling laws fit together. By directly investigating the various relations between \u03c3, L, color, and stellar population properties simultaneously, we show that\nthe various stellar population variables correlate quite\n3 It is worth keeping in mind that, although L and color are\ntreated as \"global\" variables in this work, they (unlike \u03c3) depend\nsignificantly on the stellar population properties of the galaxy and\nare thus not truly independent structural parameters. We call them\n\"global\" (along with \u03c3) for linguistic simplicity.\n\nstrongly with some of the global variables but only very\nweakly with other global variables. In particular, \u03c3 and\nL are not interchangeable. For instance, age correlates\nstrongly with \u03c3 but rather weakly with L, while [Fe/H]\nshows the opposite behavior.\nBriefly looking forward to the subsequent papers in\nthis series, Paper II maps stellar population variations\nthroughout the Fundamental Plane (FP). In Paper II we\nshow that the stellar populations of galaxies on the FP\nvary only with \u03c3; the second dimension of the face-on FP\nappears to be uncorrelated with the galaxy star formation histories. However, variations are observed through\nthe thickness of the FP. Paper III demonstrates that the\n2-D family of quiescent galaxy stellar populations can\nbe mapped onto a 2-D cross-section through the FP and\npresents a toy model of galaxy star formation histories.\nFinally, Paper IV compares various stellar (M\u22c6 /L) and\ndynamical (Mdyn /L) mass-to-light ratios for the galaxy\nsample. Paper IV demonstrates that the variations in\nM\u22c6 /L due to stellar population effects are inadequate to\nexplain the observed variation in Mdyn /L, both along the\nFP and perpendicular to the plane.\nIn \u00a72, we describe the sample of galaxies used in this\nanalysis. Section 3 reviews known properties of the color\nmagnitude relation for early type galaxies and the distribution of these galaxies in the three dimensional \u03c3-Lcolor space as a motivation for the subsequent analysis.\nIn \u00a74, we discuss the process by which we deconstruct the\ncolor-magnitude relation and measure stellar population\nproperties across the red sequence. Section 5 presents\nthe results of the analysis and maps stellar population\nages, [Fe/H], [Mg/H] and \u03b1-enhancement in the threedimensional \u03c3-L-color space. This is followed by a brief\ndiscussion of the results in \u00a76, and a summary of our\nconclusions in \u00a77.\n2. THE QUIESCENT GALAXY SAMPLE\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to achieve a fundamental understanding of the correlations between \u03c3, L, and\ncolor for typical early type galaxies and their relation to\nstellar population properties. However, from the very\noutset we face challenges in defining a reasonable sample\nwith which to explore these relations. Although there\nis a broad correspondance between galaxies with early\ntype morphologies, galaxies that lie on the red sequence,\nand galaxies that are not actively forming stars, not all\nearly type galaxies are on the red sequence, not all red\nsequence galaxies have early type morphology, and some\nearly type galaxies are still actively forming stars.\nSchawinski et al. (2007) identify a sample of morphologically selected SDSS early type galaxies and classify\ntheir emission line properties using the emission line ratio diagrams pioneered by Baldwin et al. (1981, hereafter BPT). Their early type sample consists of 81.5%\nquiescent galaxies (i.e., no > 3\u03c3 emission detections in\nH\u03b1, H\u03b2, [Oiii]\u03bb3727, or [Nii]\u03bb6583), 1.5% Seyferts, 5.7%\nlow ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs),\nand 11.2% star-forming or transition objects (which host\nboth star formation and AGN activity). The majority of their star-forming galaxies, transition objects, and\nSeyferts are not on the red sequence; clearly it would not\nmake sense to include such objects in an analysis of the\ncolor-magnitude and color-\u03c3 relations for passive galaxies. Schawinski et al. (2007) require > 3\u03c3 detections in\n\n\f3\nall four emission lines listed above and therefore likely\nidentify as \"quiescent\" numerous galaxies with low-level\nemission that may be detected in the strongest emission\nline but is below the 3\u03c3 threshold in weaker lines such as\nH\u03b2 or [Nii].\nIn a parallel study, Yan et al. (2006) classify a volumelimited color-selected sample of SDSS red sequence\ngalaxies based on their emission line ratios, also using\nBPT diagrams. They identify as quiescent only galaxies that have no emission lines detected at the 3\u03c3 level.\nIn practice, the strong H\u03b1 and [Oii]\u03bb3727 emission lines\ndrive this definition. They find that only 47.8% of red\nsequence galaxies are quiescent, with a further 28.8% exhibiting LINER-like emission and 23.4% likely hosting\nSeyfert activity, star formation, or a combination of the\ntwo. Their red sequence galaxies almost certainly include\ndust-reddened star-forming galaxies, who dust-corrected\ncolors would lie off of the red sequence.\nIn light of these studies, we have chosen to study the\ncorrelations between \u03c3, L, color, and stellar populations\nfor a sample of quiescent galaxies. Excluding galaxies\nwith active star formation removes potential contamination from dust-reddened star-forming objects whose\ncolors do not reflect their underlying stellar populations.\nThe quiescent criterion also excludes Seyferts and LINERs. Many Seyferts have early type morphologies but\ntypically have substantially younger stellar populations\n(Kauffmann et al. 2003), to the extent that they mostly\ndo not fall on the red sequence (Schawinski et al. 2007)\nand are not relevant to the typical early type galaxy\ncolor-magnitude and color-\u03c3 relations. Furthermore, a\nstrong point source may contaminate global galaxy color\ndeterminations.\nA substantially stronger case could be made for including galaxies with LINER emission because they are common on the red sequence and typically reside in early type\nhosts with red colors. In Graves et al. (2007), we analysed the stellar populations of non-star-forming red sequence galaxies, comparing quiescent galaxies with those\nhosting LINERs. We found that the LINER hosts had\nsystematically younger ages, but the same metallicities\nand abundance patterns as quiescent red sequence galaxies at the same \u03c3. They also have similar or slightly\nredder colors than their quiescent counterpart, suggesting that the color effects of their younger populations are\noffset by larger mean dust content. Excluding them from\nthe sample in this analysis will remove many of the most\nrecent arrivals on the red sequence.\nHowever, we have decided to limit the analysis in this\nwork to quiescent galaxies only, saving the LINERs for\na future separate analysis. It can be difficult to distinguish between LINERs and transition objects (Schawinski et al. 2007). There is no real consensus in the literature as to the true nature of LINER sources, which\nmay well represent a heterogeneous populations. Furthermore, there is some indication that the LINER sample of Graves et al. (2007) in fact contains two separate sub-populations. A preliminary analysis suggests\nthat these sub-populations have different stellar population properties from one another and from the quiescent\ngalaxy population, as well as different luminosity and\nmass distributions at fixed \u03c3. As such, the LINER population warrant a separate and detailed analysis.\nThe sample discussed in this paper is therefore a sam-\n\nple of quiescent galaxies, chosen spectroscopically to be\nfree of emission lines of any kind. It is not a representative sample of \"early type galaxies\" or \"red sequence\ngalaxies\", but instead provides a window onto the stellar population properties and star formation histories of\ngalaxies that are no longer forming stars. The reader\nshould bear in mind that the exclusion of LINERs from\nthe sample may remove many galaxies whose star formation ended very recently and that the mean ages of the\ngalaxies in this analysis are therefore biased toward older\nvalues. If the stellar population trends of the LINER host\ngalaxies follow the same behavior as quiescent galaxies,\nthe relative properties presented here should hold for the\nnon-star-forming galaxy population as a whole even if\nthe zeropoint of the age scale is uncertain. However, the\nproperties of the LINER population must be explored in\nfuture work to verify this possibility.\n2.1. SDSS Data\n\nThe galaxies used in this analysis are drawn from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000),\nwhich was conducted with a dedicated 2.5m telescope at\nApache Point Observatory (Gunn et al. 2006). Images\nare taken in drift-scanning mode with a mosaic CCD\ncamera (Gunn et al. 1998), processed (Lupton et al. 2001;\nStoughton et al. 2002; Pier et al. 2003), and calibrated\n(Hogg et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2002; Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2004;\nTucker et al. 2006). All galaxies used in this work are\npart of the spectroscopic Main Galaxy Sample (Strauss\net al. 2002).\nRedshifts (z), de Vaucouleurs model photometry\n(ugriz apparent magnitudes, Fukugita et al. 1996),\nGalactic extinctions, and Petrosian radii enclosing 50%\nand 90% of the total galaxy light (R50 and R90 , respectively) are taken from the NYU Value-Added Galaxy\nCatalog (Blanton et al. 2005) version of SDSS Data Release Four (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2006). These are\nsupplemented with measurements from the SDSS catalog\narchive server4 of velocity dispersions (\u03c3f ib , as measured\nin the SDSS fiber aperture), r-band de Vaucouleurs radii\n(RdeV ) and de Vaucouleurs profile axis ratios ((a/b)deV ),\nas well as the likelihoods of de Vaucouleurs and exponential fits to the galaxy light profiles. The catalog archive\nserver also provides separate magnitudes of the de Vaucouleur and exponential components of each galaxy's\nlight (essentially a bulge-disk decomposition), along with\nthe relative contribution of each, which can be used to\nconstruct model bulge + disk magnitudes and colors for\neach galaxy.\nThe algorithm for measuring velocity dispersions has\nbeen updated in Data Release Six (DR6) to correct for\nsmall systematic biases present in the pre-DR6 measurements (Bernardi 2007). They are computed using\nthe \"direct-fitting\" method (Burbidge et al. 1961; Rix\n& White 1992), based on fitting stellar templates convolved with gaussian broadening functions. Only \u03c3 values above the \u223c 70 km s\u22121 instrumental resolution are\nconsidered reliable. We therefore only use galaxies with\nlog \u03c3 > 1.86. Velocity dispersion measurement errors are\ntypically < 10% (0.04 dex), based on repeat measurements of individual SDSS galaxies5.\n4\n5\n\nhttp://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr6/algorithms/veldisp.html\n\n\f4\n\nGraves et al.\n\nThere is a known problem with SDSS photometry of\nbright galaxies caused by scattered light that biases the\nsky background high. Because of this, the total luminosities and radii of bright galaxies are underestimated by the\nSDSS pipeline, as noted by Lauer et al. (2007), Bernardi\net al. (2007), and Lisker et al. (2007). To correct for\nthis effect, we use the results of the simulations reported\non the SDSS website6 to compute magnitude and radius\ncorrections as a function of apparent magnitude, which\nwe apply to the galaxies in our sample. We additionally\nlimit our sample to galaxies with 15 < r < 18 to avoid\nthe worst of the photometry errors caused by this effect. The Galactic extinction corrections from the NYU\nValue-Added Catalog are applied to all photometry.\nThe galaxy sample presented here is limited to a modest range in redshift (0.04 < z < 0.08). This has a\nnumber of advantages. The SDSS Main Galaxy Sample is limited to apparent magnitude r < 17.77. For\n0.04 < z < 0.08, our galaxy sample is complete down to\nabsolute magnitude Mr = \u221220.12, while the lower end of\nour redshift range provides data down to Mr > \u221219. The\nrelatively small range in redshifts means that the range\nin lookback times over the entire sample is only \u2206t \u223c 0.5\nGyr, which essentially eliminates the effects of evolution\nwithin our sample. At these redshifts, the SDSS spectral fibers (1.5\u2032\u2032 radius) cover a significant portion of the\ngalaxy, typically \u223c RdeV /2. These spectra are therefore\nnot nuclear spectra but sample a substantial fraction of\nthe galaxy light.\n\nprovide consistent comparisons with past stellar population work, which typically uses central velocity dispersion\nmeasurements. In practice, velocity dispersion gradients\nare shallow, and this correction is small (of order \u223c 6%).\nThe r-band and g-band magnitudes used throughout this\npaper have been K-corrected to z = 0.0 using the IDL\ncode kcorrect v4.1.4 (Blanton et al. 2003) and converted\nto absolute magnitudes (Mr and Mg ) assuming a standard \u039bCDM cosmology with \u039b = 0.7, \u03a9M = 0.3 and\nh = 0.7.\nSpectra of the galaxies in our final sample were downloaded from the SDSS DR6 (Adelman-McCarthy 2007)\nversion of the SDSS data archive server7.\n2.2. Selection Criteria\n\nTo create a sample of passively evolving galaxies, we\ninclude only those galaxies with no emission from ionized\ngas. Specifically, we require that the measured equivalent widths of H\u03b1 and [Oii]\u03bb3727 emission be below a 2\u03c3\ndetection threshold, as determined by Yan et al. (2006).\nIn this sample, the typical 2\u03c3 detection threshold corresponds to H\u03b1 and [Oii] equivalent widths of \u223c 0.3 \u00c5 and\n\u223c 1.7 \u00c5, respectively. This criterion excludes galaxies\nwith significant ongoing star formation within the central portion of the galaxy covered by the spectral fiber, as\nwell as active galactic nuclei (AGN) with optical emission\nlines (Yan et al. 2006).\nBecause the SDSS spectra only sample galaxy light\nwith the 3\u2032\u2032 spectral fiber radius, selecting quiescent\ngalaxies in this way does not exclude disk galaxies with\nquiescent central bulge populations which harbor star\nformation in their outer regions. These galaxies are not\ntruly quiescent galaxies, although they may have quiescent bulges. To limit contamination by these galaxies,\nwe follow Bernardi et al. (2003a) in excluding galaxies\nwith R90 /R50 < 2.5 in the i-band (eliminating galaxies without centrally-concentrated light profiles) and for\nwhich the likelihood of a de Vaucouleurs light profile fit\nis less than 1.03 times the likelihood of an exponential\nfit. These further cuts reduce the sample size by < 10%,\nleaving a total sample of 16,008 galaxies.\nIn summary, the galaxies in this study have been selected from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample using the\nfollowing criteria:\n1. Redshift range: 0.04 < z < 0.08\n2. Apparent magnitude range: 15 < r < 18\n\nFig. 1.- Sample galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram. Points\nshow the galaxies that meet the sample selection criteria described\nin \u00a72, while contours show all galaxies at 0.04 < z < 0.08. Galaxies\nin the sample are selected to be free of emission lines and to have\nlight profiles characteristic of early type galaxies. No explicit color\nselection is applied, yet the resulting galaxy sample consists almost\nexclusively of red sequence galaxies. The remaining color outliers\nare not included in the stacked spectra. See \u00a74.1 for details.\n\nThroughout the rest of this paper, we will use velocity\ndispersion measurements that have been corrected to 1/8\neffective radius. Following Bernardi et al. (2003a) and\nJ\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995), we use \u03c3 = \u03c3f ib (rf ib / 18 r\u25e6 )0.04 ,\nwhere r\u25e6 is the circularpgalaxy radius in arc seconds,\ncomputed as r\u25e6 = RdeV (a/b)deV , and rf ib is the spectral fiber radius, 1.5\u2032\u2032 for SDSS spectra. This allows us to\n6\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr6/start/aboutdr6.html\n\n3. No detected emission in H\u03b1 and [Oii]\u03bb3727\n4. Concentrated light profiles: R90 /R50 > 2.5 in the\ni-band\n5. Likelihood of a de Vaucouleurs light profile \u2265 1.03\ntimes larger than the likelihoood of an exponential\nlight profile\nThroughout the rest of this paper, we refer to the\ngalaxies in our sample as quiescent or passive galaxies,\nwith the understanding that this categorization refers to\ngalaxies which are not actively forming stars.\nIn Figure 1, the galaxies used in this analysis are shown\nwith respect to the color-magnitude distribution of all\n7\n\nhttp://das.sdss.org/DR6-cgi-bin/DAS\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 2.- Thumbnail images of a random selection of galaxies from the sample. Circles indicate the size of the 3\u2032\u2032 SDSS spectral fibers.\nThe sample is dominated by early type galaxies, but contains some bulge-dominated spirals as well at a range of orientations. Even where\na disk is present, the spectral fiber predominantly samples light from the bulge.\n\ngalaxies in this redshift range. The gray points show\nthe galaxies included in the sample, while the contour\nlines show the underlying color-magnitude distribution\nof all galaxies with 0.04 < z < 0.08 from the SDSS Main\nGalaxy spectroscopic sample. In choosing the sample\npresented here, no explicit color selection was applied,\nyet the resulting sample of galaxies populates a narrow\nred sequence relation between galaxy Mr and color. Figure 2 shows thumbnail images for a randomly-selected set\nof galaxies from our final sample. The galaxies all have\nsmooth morphologies. About 20% of the galaxies have\n\nsignificant disks, although all show evidence for prominant bulges. In the appendix, we show that the use of\nmagnitudes and colors from de Vaucouleur fits to the\ngalaxy light profiles (even in galaxies which have a disk\ncomponent) has a negligible effect on our results.\nOf our sample galaxies, 85% have bulge fractions above\n0.8 while only 3% have bulge fractions below 0.5, making the sample galaxies highly bulge-dominated. Figure\n2 shows that the sample contains a modest fraction of\nface-on and edge-on galaxy disks, however these do not\ndominate the light of the galaxies. Furthermore, the disk\n\n\f6\n\nGraves et al.\n\ncontribution to the measured spectrum will be substantially smaller than its contribution to the total galaxy\nlight. The 3\u2032\u2032 SDSS spectral fibers (shown as circles in\nFigure 2) sample roughly 0.3\u20130.6 of the typical galaxy\neffective radius at these redshifts. In face-on disks, the\nSDSS 3\u2032\u2032 spectral fiber predominantly samples the galaxy\nbulge, while the spectra of inclined disks will contain\na slightly increased light contribution from the galaxy\ndisks. Edge-on disks in the sample must have negligible\nongoing star formation in order to satisfy the stringent\nemission line cuts.\n3. THE COLOR-MAGNITUDE RELATION\n\nThe selection criteria defined above result in a sample\nof quiescent galaxies which populate the red sequence\nin the color-magnitude diagram. These galaxies show a\nclear color-magnitude relation (Figure 3, top panel), such\nthat more luminous galaxies have redder colors. Data\npoints are color-coded by bins in \u03c3 as labelled in the\nlower figure panels. In the lower panels, the total galaxy\nsample is shown as a cloud of gray data points, with the\ntotal color-magnitude relation overplotted as the gray\ndotted line. In each panel, contours indicate the colormagnitude distribution of galaxies within a single bin in\n\u03c3, as labeled. These \u03c3 bins are used throughout this paper. The vertical dashed line in Figure 3 indicates the\ncompleteness limit of the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample in\nthe redshift range used for this analysis. The solid line at\nMr = \u221219.7 shows where we expect the sample is missing more than 50% of the galaxies at these magnitudes.\nThus the lack of galaxies at fainter magnitudes is likely\na selection effect rather than a genuine lack of galaxies\nat Mr > \u221219.7.\nWhat is notable about the contours in Figure 3 is\nthat they show no color-magnitude relation at fixed \u03c3,\nin agreement with the work of Bernardi et al. (2005). In\neach panel, which illustrates a narrow range in \u03c3, the\ncontours in the color-magnitude diagram are horizontal.\nHowever, galaxies with larger \u03c3 (red points) are generally more luminous and have redder colors than those\nwith smaller \u03c3 (blue and purple points), so that superposing the various \u03c3 bins results in a net color-magnitude\nrelation.\nIn contrast, the color-\u03c3 relation is readily apparent at\nfixed Mr (Figure 4, top). Here, colored data points indicate bins in luminosity, with dark green, light green,\nyellow, orange, pink, and purple data points corresponding to \u221218.8 > Mr > \u221220.0, \u221220.0 > Mr > \u221220.4,\n\u221220.4 > Mr > \u221220.8, \u221220.8 > Mr > \u221221.2, \u221221.2 >\nMr > \u221221.6, and \u221221.6 > Mr > \u221223, respectively. A\nclear color-\u03c3 relation is apparent at fixed Mr (e.g., purple data points), with roughly the same slope at the total\ncolor-\u03c3 relation. This color-\u03c3 correlation is stronger and\ntighter than the color-magnitude relation shown in Figure 3.\nFinally, the bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the \u03c3magnitude or Faber-Jackson relation, color-coded by\ngalaxy g \u2212 r color. Dark blue, medium blue, light blue,\npale pink, medium pink, and dark pink data points represent g\u2212r < 0.74, 0.74 < g\u2212r < 0.76, 0.76 < g\u2212r < 0.78,\n0.78 < g \u2212r < 0.80, 0.80 < g \u2212r < 0.82, and 0.82 < g \u2212r,\nrespectively. The \u03c3-magnitude relation is tight for the\nmost luminous galaxies, but shows considerable spread\nfor faint galaxies. The spread is correlated with galaxy\n\ncolor, such that bluer galaxies tend to have lower \u03c3 at\nfixed luminosity. This may indicate that fainter, bluer\ngalaxies have a larger degree of rotational support, resulting in lower values of \u03c3 for a given M\u2217 .\nIt is clear that \u03c3, luminosity, and color are all correlated in early type galaxies. Bernardi et al. (2005)\nargue that the fundamental relations are \u03c3-color and \u03c3magnitude and that the color-magnitude relation results\nfrom a combination of these two correlations. The color\u03c3 relation (Figure 4, top) exists independent of galaxy\nluminosity (i.e., at fixed Mr ). Likewise, the \u03c3-magnitude\nrelation (Figure 4, bottom) exists independent of galaxy\ncolor. However, the color-magnitude relation does not\nexist at fixed \u03c3 (Figure 3), indicating that the \u03c3 dependence of both color and magnitude is what leads to the\nobserved color-magnitude relation.\nFrom Figure 3, it is also clear that galaxies with very\nsimilar values of \u03c3 show a substantial spread in Mr . The\nlow\u2013\u03c3 bins suffer from incompleteness effects, but in the\nhigher \u03c3 bins (e.g., those with log \u03c3 \u2265 2.18), it is clear\nthat galaxies with a range of only 0.09 dex in log \u03c3 span\nroughly 2 mag (0.8 dex) in Mr . Similarly, the substantial\noverlap of the \u03c3 bins in the color-magnitude diagram\nmeans that galaxies at fixed Mr have a range of \u03c3.\nThese arguments illustrate that optical luminosity L is\nnot a good proxy for \u03c3. This is expected from the fact\nthat galaxies populate the FP and the Faber-Jackson relation is not an edge-on projection of the FP (Dressler\net al. 1987). The two parameters are, however, often used\ninterchangeably in the literature as measures of galaxy\nsize or mass. We will see in \u00a75.1 that using L versus using\n\u03c3 as the controlling variable in stellar population studies\ncan lead to substantially different stellar population scaling relations, because stellar population properties vary\nsystematically with L at fixed \u03c3.\n4. DISSECTING THE COLOR-MAGNITUDE RELATION\n\nAccurate stellar population parameters can only be derived from high S/N spectra (S/N \u2265 100 \u00c5\u22121 ; Cardiel\net al. 1998). As individual SDSS galaxy spectra in our\nsample typically have S/N \u2248 20 \u00c5\u22121 , dozens or more\nspectra must be combined to achieve the necessary S/N .\nIf galaxies are combined randomly, the average spectra\nwould all look very similar. The challenge in this method\nis to identify useful ways of sorting the galaxies in advance, in order to do the best possible job of populating\nthe full range of galaxy star formation histories, without\naveraging out all the interesting variations.\nIn this section, we define a three-dimensional parameter space of \u03c3 (which is not sensitive to stellar population effects) along with L and color (which are) and sort\ngalaxies into bins in this space. We then stack the spectra\nof galaxies within each bin and measure absorption line\nstrengths. In \u00a75, we combine the observed line strengths\nwith stellar population models to obtain the fundamental stellar population parameters of galaxies along and\nacross the color-magnitude relation.\n4.1. Binning by \u03c3, L, and color\n\nIn \u00a73, we divided our sample of quiescent galaxies into\nsix bins based on \u03c3. To study how stellar populations\nvary at fixed \u03c3, we further divide those same \u03c3 bins into\nthree bins in color by three bins in L for a total of 54 bins.\nFigure 5 illustrates this process for the log \u03c3 = 2.18\u20132.27\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 3.- Top panel: The color-magnitude relation for all galaxies in our sample. Data points are color-coded by \u03c3, with purple (red)\nindicating the lowest (highest) \u03c3 bin. The dashed vertical lines show the completeness limit of the sample, while the solid vertical lines\nshow the magnitude at which the sample is missing 50% of the galaxies (i.e., where the sample becomes severely incomplete). Lower panels:\nThe color\u2013magnitude relation for galaxies at fixed \u03c3. Gray points show the color-magnitude relation for the total galaxy sample, while\nover-plotted contours show the color-magnitude distribution of galaxies within a limited range in \u03c3, as labeled. Contour lines indicate a\nnumber density of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 galaxies per bin, where bins in Mr and g \u2212 r are defined by the tickmarks on the axes.\nThe gray dotted line indicates the color-magnitude relation for the total sample. Galaxies with larger values of \u03c3 tend to be brighter and\nredder than those at lower \u03c3. However, galaxies at fixed \u03c3 span a substantial range in both color and magnitude, so that different bins in\n\u03c3 show a large amount of overlap in both color and magnitude. At fixed \u03c3, there is no color-magnitude relation. Combining galaxies from\nall \u03c3 bins results in an overall color-magnitude relation.\n\nbin. Cuts in color and L are defined with fixed width,\nsuch that each L bin is 0.8 mag wide in Mr and each\ncolor bin is 0.032 mag wide in g \u2212 r. The 3x3 grid of\nsub-bins is centered on the median Mr and g \u2212 r for all\nthe galaxies in the given \u03c3 bin. The median values of \u03c3,\nMr , and g \u2212 r for each of the 54 bins are listed in Table\nC1, along with the total number of galaxies in each bin.\nThe central sub-bin in color\u2013L space contains more\n\ngalaxies than the outer bins, but all bins are sufficiently\nwell populated to produce high S/N stacked spectra.\nDefining the color\u2013L grid in this way excludes color and L\noutliers from each \u03c3 bin, which ensures that the stacked\nspectra will not be biased by very deviant or misidentified objects.\nIn the lowest \u03c3 bins, the magnitude limit of the sample\npresented here means that the fainter galaxies at that \u03c3\n\n\f8\n\nGraves et al.\n\nFig. 4.- Top panel: The color-\u03c3 relation, with data points color-coded by galaxy luminosity. Dark green (purple) points show the\nfaintest (brightest) luminosity bins. A color-\u03c3 relation exists at fixed Mr (e.g., purple data points alone) with roughly the same slope as\nthe total color-\u03c3 relation. The color-\u03c3 trend is stronger and narrower than the color-magnitude relation in Figure 3. Bottom panel: The\n\u03c3-magnitude relation, color-coded by galaxy g \u2212 r color. Dark blue (dark pink) points show the bluest (reddest) galaxies. The \u03c3-magnitude\nrelation is broader for fainter galaxies. This is correlated with galaxy color, such that bluer galaxies tend to have lower \u03c3 at fixed Mr . This\nmay be due to a greater degree of rotational support in fainter and bluer early type galaxies, showing lower \u03c3 for the same M\u2217 .\n\nare under-represented. Under the assumption that the\nmissing faint galaxies at z \u223c 0.08 are not substantially\ndifferent from those at z \u223c 0.04 which are included in\nthe sample, the fainter bins are not strongly biased but\nare less populated than they ought to be. Comparisons\nbetween galaxies at different L in the same \u03c3 bin should\ntherefore be robust to completeness effects. However,\nbecause these \u03c3 bins are missing the faintest galaxies,\nthe median Mr used to locate the color\u2013L grid may be\nbiased brighter than the underlying galaxy population at\nthat \u03c3.\n4.2. Constructing the stacked spectra\n\nIn each of the 54 bins in \u03c3\u2013L\u2013color space, we combine\nspectra of the galaxies in the bin in order to produce a\nvery high S/N average spectrum. Regions around the\nbright skylines at 5577\u00c5, 6300\u00c5, and 6363\u00c5 are masked\nin the individual galaxy spectra, which are then shifted to\n\nthe restframe. The individual spectra are normalized so\nthat all galaxies in the bin contribute equally to the averaged spectrum. The normalization uses the median flux\nin the 4100\u20135000\u00c5 range without modifying the continuum shape, as the flux-calibrated spectral shape affects\nthe Lick index measurements. In practice, because the\ngalaxies in a given bin have very similar colors, the shape\nof the continuum is nearly identical for all galaxies in the\nbin.\nThe stellar absorption features in higher \u03c3 galaxies\nare effectively observed at lower resolution than those in\nlower \u03c3 galaxies, due to the increased intrinsic Doppler\nsmoothing of the lines from stellar motions within the\ngalaxy. This intrinsic smoothing has non-negligible effects on the measured absorption line strengths. In order\nto compare all galaxies at the same effective resolution,\nwe smooth lower\u2013\u03c3 galaxies up to match the highest-\u03c3\ngalaxies in our sample, \u03c3 \u2248 300 km s\u22121 . The algorithm\n\n\f9\n\nFig. 5.- Method used to bin galaxies by L and color at fixed \u03c3.\nThe color-magnitude relation for the total quiescent galaxy sample\nin this typical \u03c3 bin is indicated by the gray contours. Overplotted\nas gray points are all galaxies with 2.18 < log \u03c3 < 2.27. Within\nthis \u03c3 bin, there is no color-magnitude relation. The median point\nin Mr and g \u2212 r is shown as the black cross in the center. Galaxies\nin this \u03c3 bin are divided into a 3x3 grid in color-magnitude space,\nwith the grid centered on the median point and with fixed grid\nspacing of 0.8 mag in Mr and 0.032 mag in g \u2212 r. Defining the\ngrid in this way eliminates color and L outliers which may bias the\naverage properties of the bins. Galaxies in each of the six \u03c3 bins\nare sorted in this way into nine sub-bins in color\u2013L space, and the\ngalaxies in each sub-bin are stacked as described in \u00a74.2 to produce\nhigh S/N mean spectra for all 54 bins in \u03c3\u2013L\u2013color space.\n\nwe use to stack the galaxy spectra first averages the unsmoothed spectra of galaxies within narrow \u03c3 sub-bins,\nwith a routine that rejects very deviant pixels. The average clean sub-bin spectra are then smoothed to the\nmaximum \u03c3 of the sample (\u223c 300 km s\u22121 ) and coadded.\nThe result is a stacked spectrum for each \u03c3\u2013L\u2013color bin\nfrom which outlier pixels have been rejected and which\nhas been smoothed to an effective resolution identical to\nall the other bins. The error spectrum is also computed\nfrom the individual SDSS galaxy error spectra by adding\nthe individual pixel errors in quadrature to produce an\nerror spectrum for each stacked spectrum.\n4.3. Lick Index absorption strengths\n\nWe measure the full set of Lick indices in each of the\nstacked spectra. These include the Balmer lines H\u03b2,\nH\u03b3F , and H\u03b4F (also broad definitions of H\u03b3A and H\u03b4A ),\nand a set of Fe-dominated lines (Fe4383, Fe4531, Fe5015,\nFe5270, Fe5335, Fe5406, Fe5709, and Fe5782), as well\nas numerous lines that are sensitive to abundances of\nelements other than Fe (Mg1 , Mg2 , Mg b, CN1 , CN2 ,\nC2 4668, Ca4227, Ca4455, NaD, TiO1 , and TiO2 ). The\nindex definitions are taken from Worthey et al. (1994)\nand Worthey & Ottaviani (1997), and line strengths are\nmeasured using the Lick EW code that is available online8 as part of the EZ Ages code package (Graves & Schiavon 2008). The Lick EW code also computes statistical\nerrors for each Lick index based on the error spectra, using equations 33 and 37 of Cardiel et al. (1998). Because\nthe Lick indices are defined as equivalent widths, they\nare insensitive to dust extinction effects.\n8\n\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cgraves/EZ Ages.html\n\nAll the stacked spectra have been smoothed to \u03c3 = 300\nkm s\u22121 . Combined with the intrinsic resolution of the\nSDSS spectrograph, the spectra are at lower resolution\nthan the Lick/IDS resolution at which the Lick indices\nare defined. A correction must be applied to the measured line strengths to bring them back onto the Lick\nindex system. These corrections are included in the\nLick EW computation, based upon smooth single stellar population spectra, as given in Schiavon (2007) Table\nA2a. All of the spectra have been smoothed to the same\n\u03c3 and corrected in the same way so that uncertainties in\nthe velocity dispersion correction should not affect relative lines strength measurements. The corrected Lick index measurements and statistical errors for each of the 54\nstacked spectra are given in Table C2. We do not attempt\nto match the zeropoints of the SDSS spectra to those of\nthe Lick system as defined by Schiavon (2007). This\nshould only introduce minor zero-point uncertainties because the Schiavon models are based on flux-calibrated\nspectra and the SDSS spectra are also flux calibrated (see\nSchiavon 2007, section 2.2.2).\n4.4. Stellar population modelling\n\nWe compare the Lick index measurements for each of\nthe stacked spectra to the stellar population models of\nSchiavon (2007) to derive fundamental stellar population\nparameters from the line strengths. The Schiavon (2007)\nmodels are single burst models which include the effect of\nvariable abudance ratios by combining theoretical stellar\nisochrones (Girardi et al. 2000) with a library of empirical\nstellar spectra (Jones 1999) and individual line strength\nsensitivities to elemental abundance variations computed\nfrom theoretical stellar atmospheres (Korn et al. 2005).\nWith these models, a set of Lick index measurements can\nbe used to determine the mean luminosity-weighted stellar population age, iron abundance ([Fe/H]), and abundance ratios for the elements Mg, C, N, and Ca ([Mg/Fe],\n[C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [Ca/Fe]) using the algorithm described in Graves & Schiavon (2008) and implemented\nin the publicly available9 code EZ Ages. Briefly, the\nGraves & Schiavon (2008) method determines a fiducial\nmean age and [Fe/H] from a combination of Balmer and\nFe-dominated indices, then uses other indices which are\nsensitive to Mg, C, N, and Ca to adjust the element abundance ratios until the model index predictions match the\nensemble of Lick index data. The basic modelling process has not changed since the original analysis of red sequence galaxies with LINER-like emission in Graves et al.\n(2007); subsequent minor updates to the EZ Ages code\nhave improved the robustness of the code at runtime and\nproduce results that match those of Graves et al. (2007)\nwithin the quoted errors. EZ Ages estimates stastical errors for each of the stellar population parameters, based\non the measurements errors in the Lick indices. The errors in these various parameters are not independent; an\nanalysis of the correlated errors is presented in Figure 3\nof Graves & Schiavon (2008). The reader is referred to\nthat article for additional details on the age and abundance fitting process.\nGraves & Schiavon (2008) have shown that this fitting\nmethod is robust to the choice of Lick indices used in\nthe analysis. Here we use the \"standard set\" of Lick in9\n\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cgraves/EZ Ages.html\n\n\f10\n\nGraves et al.\n\nFig. 6.- Mean stellar population parameters for each of the\n54 stacked galaxy spectra, shown as a function of median \u03c3 for\nthe galaxies in each bin. The error bars in the lower right corner of each panel show the median statistical error in the derived\npopulation parameters, based on the uncertainties in the Lick index measurements. The data have been separated into those with\nsmall statistical errors (black) and those with larger statistical errors (gray), as indicated by the corresponding error bars. \"Large\"\nstatistical errors are defined as those more than two standard deviations larger than the median error. Mean luminosity-weighted\nstellar age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] all increase with increasing \u03c3. Dashed lines show linear least squares fits of the stellar\npopulation properties onto log \u03c3, computed using the black data\npoints only. The Spearman rank correlation coeffecients (rs ) of\nthe correlations are specified in each panel. The scatter in mean\nage and [Fe/H] is significantly larger than that expected due to\nmeasurement errors, implying genuine variation in these population parameters at fixed \u03c3. The spread in age is small for the\nhighest\u2013\u03c3 galaxies, all of which show old ages, while the lowest\u2013\u03c3\ngalaxies cover a substantial factor in mean age. There is only modest scatter in either [Mg/Fe] or [Mg/H] at fixed \u03c3. The correlation\nbewteen \u03c3 and [Mg/H] is particulary strong, as indicated by the\nvery high value of rs .\n\ndices from Graves & Schiavon (2008)-H\u03b2, hFei (which\nis an average of the Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices), Mg b,\nC2 4668, CN1 , and Ca4227-with the EZ Ages code to\nfit a mean luminosity-weighted age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe],\n[C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [Ca/Fe] for each of the 54 average\ngalaxy spectra. We can thus track each of these stellar\npopulation parameters as a function of \u03c3, L, and color\nfor the galaxies in our sample.\nIn this analysis, we focus on the stellar population\nage, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe], leaving the analysis\nof other abundance ratios for future work. The results\nof the stellar population analysis for the stacked spectra are presented in Table C2. Of the \u03b1-elements, Mg\nis the only one that is relatively straightfoward to measure in optical galaxy spectra. For the purposes of this\ntype of stellar population work, it is typically assumed\nthat all \u03b1-elements scale together and thus that [Mg/Fe]\nis equivalent to [\u03b1/Fe]. There is some observational evidence that \u03b1 elements may not always vary in lock-step\n(e.g., Fulbright et al. 2007; Humphrey & Buote 2006)\nbut, lacking an alternative, we will use [Mg/Fe] as an estimate of the total [\u03b1/Fe]. The Schiavon (2007) models\nare computed at fixed [Fe/H] rather than at fixed total\nmetallicity ([Z/H]), so that enhancements in individual\nelements also change the total metallicity of the galaxy.\nIt is important to keep in mind that the stellar pop-\n\nFig. 7.- Mean stellar population parameters as a function of\ngalaxy L. The results of the stellar population analysis are plotted\nagainst the median Mr for the galaxies in each bin. Statistical\nerrors in the derived population parameters are shown in the lower\nright corner of each panel. The data have been separated into\nthose with small statistical errors (black) and those with larger\nstatistical errors (gray), as indicated by the corresponding error\nbars. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs ) is given for\neach relation. The strong increases in mean age and [Mg/Fe] visible\nin Figure 6 when plotted against \u03c3 are considerably washed out\nwhen plotted against Mr , while the trend between [Fe/H] and Mr\nis much tighter than the \u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] relation. The [Mg/H]\u2013Mr is\nstill strong, although rs indicates it is slightly weaker than the\n\u03c3\u2013[Mg/H] correlation.\n\nulation parameters based on modelling absorption line\nindices give ages and abundances averaged over the ensemble of stars in the galaxy. The contribution of each\nstar to the average age or abundance measurement is\nproportional to the light contributed at the wavelength\nof the absorption feature in question, and also to the\nequivalent width of the particular absorption feature of\nthat star. When comparing ages of galaxies, a younger\nmean luminosity-weighted age in one galaxy compared\nto another does not necessarily mean that all of the stars\nin the galaxy are younger: a galaxy may contain a fraction of young stars that skew the average age to lower\nvalues. The luminosity-weighted ages presented here are\nalso averaged over the ensemble of galaxies in the bin\nand should thus be treated as a statistical description of\ngalaxies in that bin rather than as \"true\" ages for all of\nthe stars in an individual galaxy.\n5. STELLAR POPULATIONS ON THE RED SEQUENCE\n5.1. Age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] as Functions of\n\n\u03c3, L, and Color\nFigure 6 shows the age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe]\nresults of the stellar population analysis as a function\nof galaxy \u03c3. The stellar population parameters derived\nfrom the stacked spectra are plotted against the median\nvalue of \u03c3 for the ensemble of galaxies in each of the 54\nbins. The median statistical errors in the derived population parameters are shown in the lower right corner\nof each panel. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs )10 is shown for each pair of parameters, indicating the strength of the correlation. Age, [Fe/H],\n10 For a given pair of parameters, r indicates the extent to\ns\nwhich they produce the same rank ordering of objects, with 0 in-\n\n\f11\n\nFig. 8.- Mean stellar population parameters as a function of\ngalaxy color. The results of the stellar population analysis are\nplotted against the median g \u2212 r color for the galaxies in each bin.\nStatistical errors in the derived population parameters are shown in\nthe lower right corner of each panel. The data have been separated\ninto those with small statistical errors (black) and those with larger\nstatistical errors (gray), as indicated by the corresponding error\nbars. The Spearman rank correlation coefficienct (rs ) is given for\neach relation. Here, mean age increases with color, similar to the\n\u03c3\u2013age trend observed in Figure 6 although with somewhat smaller\nscatter in log age at fixed g \u2212 r than was seen at fixed \u03c3. However,\n[Fe/H] shows only a very weak trend with color, while [Mg/Fe]\nand [Mg/H] increase significantly in redder galaxies. Neither the\n[Mg/Fe]\u2013color nor [Mg/H]\u2013color trends are as strong as the those\nwith \u03c3, as indicated by rs .\n\n[Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] all show correlations with \u03c3, such\nthat higher\u2013\u03c3 galaxies have older mean ages, higher iron\nabundances, higher magnesium abundances, and higher\nlevels of Mg-enhancement, which strongly suggests that\nhigher\u2013\u03c3 galaxies also have higher total metallicities.\nThese results are in agreement with numerous previous\nauthors (e.g., Bernardi et al. 2003b; Thomas et al. 2005;\nNelan et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2007a; see summary in\nTable 8 of Graves et al. 2007), although these trends are\nnot universally observed in all early type galaxy samples\n(e.g., Kelson et al. 2006; Trager et al. 2008).\nThe [Mg/H]-\u03c3 and [Mg/Fe]-\u03c3 relations are particularly\ntight compared to the typical measurement errors. This\nimplies that at fixed \u03c3 [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe] vary only\nweakly with the other two global parameters studied here\n(L and color). At high \u03c3, [Mg/H] shows almost no variation at fixed \u03c3. A linear least-squares fit of [Mg/Fe] onto\n\u03c3 gives a slope of 0.34, which is consistent with previous\nresults.\nUnlike [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], both age and [Fe/H] show\nscatter at fixed \u03c3 that is large compared to the statistical\nerror bars. For [Fe/H], the scatter is roughly the same\nat all \u03c3, whereas the spread in mean ages at fixed \u03c3 appears to be larger for lower\u2013\u03c3 galaxies. It is noteworthy\nthat some low\u2013\u03c3 galaxies have mean ages nearly as old\nas some of the highest-\u03c3 galaxy bins. Thus any model\nfor galaxy formation that predicts a correlation between\ndicating no correlation and 1 indicating perfect correlation. The\nsign of rs indicates whether the correlation is positive or negative.\nThe definition of rs makes no assumptions about the functional\nform of the correlation and allows robust comparison of correlation\nstrengths between different correlations.\n\ngalaxy \u03c3 and galaxy age must also be able to accommodate low\u2013\u03c3 galaxies with old ages.\nBecause \u03c3 correlates with both L and color (see \u00a73),\none might expect to see similar correlations between stellar population properties and L or color as were seen for\n\u03c3. Figure 7 shows the derived stellar population parameters as functions of L, while Figure 8 shows the same as\nfunctions of galaxy color. Interestingly, when the stellar\npopulation properties are plotted against L instead of \u03c3,\nthe correlations with age and [Mg/Fe] are nearly erased,\nwhile the correlation with [Fe/H] is much tighter. Conversely, when they are plotted against color, the correlation with mean stellar age is slightly tighter than with\n\u03c3, while the [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] correlations are weaker\nthan with \u03c3. Of the four stellar population parameters,\n[Mg/H] alone shows relatively strong correlations with\nall three global parameters, although it is most strongly\ncorrelated with \u03c3.\nFigures 6\u20138 show that, although \u03c3, L, and color are\nall correlated with one another, the various stellar population parameters show significantly different behavior with each of the global parameters. Residuals from\nthe \u03c3\u2013stellar population relations must correlate with L\nand color in such a way as to erase some trends and\nstrengthen others when L or color are used instead of \u03c3.\nThis correlation of residuals immediately suggests that\nquiescent galaxies populate a multi-dimensional stellar\npopulation parameter space. To explore these effects in\ndetail, we must investigate the dependence of stellar age,\n[Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] on all three global parameters simultaneously.\n5.2. Mapping Stellar Populations Across the Red\n\nSequence\nFigure 9 shows contours of stellar population age as\na function of \u03c3, L, and color. The six panels contain\ndata for our six standard \u03c3 slices corresponding to the\npanels in Figure 3. Black and gray data points in each\npanel show the color-magnitude relation at that \u03c3, with\ngray points indicating galaxies in the \u03c3 range which were\nexcluded from the stacked spectra.\nPlotted over the color-magnitude relations in each bin\nare color contours representing the mean luminosityweighted ages derived from the stacked spectra. The age\ncontours were constructed as follows: age values from\nthe stacked spectra in each \u03c3 range were plotted at the\nmedian values of Mr and g \u2212 r for each bin, forming a\n3x3 grid of age values in color-magnitude space. Values of age were linearly interpolated (in log age) between\nthe nine grid points to produce age contours across the\ncolor-magnitude relation. The color bar in the lower right\npanel indicates the scaling of the age contours, with the\nlowest and highest values indicated. The dashed lines at\nMr = \u221221 and g \u2212 r = 0.75 are the same in all panels\nand exist merely to guide the eye. As \u03c3 increases, galaxies become systematically both brighter and redder with\nrespect to the dashed lines.\nThe age contours in Figure 9 illustrate the same trends\nthat were visible in Figure 6. As \u03c3 increases from low\n(upper left panel) to high values (lower right panel), the\naverage age indicated by the contours increases. However, in each slice in \u03c3, a range of ages exists. The spread\nin ages at fixed \u03c3 is large in the low\u2013\u03c3 bins and becomes\nincreasingly smaller toward the highest\u2013\u03c3 bins.\n\n\f12\n\nGraves et al.\n\nFig. 9.- Mean luminosity-weighted age as a function of \u03c3, L, and color. Each panel shows the color-magnitude diagram for a slice in\n\u03c3, corresponding to the six \u03c3 bins in Figure 3. Black points represent galaxies that fall within 1.2 mag of the median Mr and within 0.048\nmag of the median g \u2212 r for the \u03c3 bin. Gray points show galaxies that fall outside these boundaries and which are excluded from the\nstacked spectra, as described in \u00a74.1. Overplotted are contours of mean luminosity-weighted galaxy age, derived from the stellar population\nmodelling in \u00a74.4. The dashed lines are reference lines to guide the eye when comparing between \u03c3 bins. Stellar population age increases\nwith increasing \u03c3, but shows substantial scatter within a fixed \u03c3 slice. There is more age variation amongst low\u2013\u03c3 galaxies than in high\u2013\u03c3\ngalaxies. At fixed \u03c3, lines of constant age run roughly diagonally across the color-magnitude diagram, with younger galaxies having bluer\ncolors and brighter luminosities, while older galaxies have redder colors and fainter luminosities. When the various \u03c3 slices are stacked\ntogether into the observed red sequence, the decrease in age with L at fixed \u03c3 counter-acts the overall increase of age with \u03c3, erasing the\nage trend when L is used to parameterize galaxies instead of \u03c3 (as in Figure 7). See \u00a75.2 for details.\n\nThe contours also illustrate the behavior of stellar population age at fixed \u03c3 across the color-magnitude relation. Lines of constant age thus run roughly diagonally\nin color-magnitude space at fixed \u03c3, with young ages in\nthe lower right corner (bright and blue) and old ages in\nthe upper left corner (faint and red). This trend is approximately repeated in each \u03c3 slice, although at high\n\u03c3 the dynamic range is less. The variation at fixed \u03c3\ncannot be explained by errors in \u03c3 that result in galaxies\nbeing assigned to the wrong stacked spectrum because\nthis would result in the opposite effect: galaxy contamination from higher\u2013\u03c3 bins would tend to make the more\nluminous galaxies appear older, not younger.\nFigure 10 shows the same slices through the colormagnitude relation, this time with color contours indicating [Fe/H]. Again, the trends of Figure 6 are visible:\n[Fe/H] increases with \u03c3 from the lowest\u2013\u03c3 bins to the\nhighest, and a range in [Fe/H] exists within each slice\n\nin \u03c3. However, the variation in [Fe/H] at fixed \u03c3 is\nmarkedly different from the age variation seen in Figure 9. Lines of constant [Fe/H] run nearly vertically in\nthe color-magnitude diagram for fixed \u03c3, such that more\nluminous galaxies have higher [Fe/H].\nThe contours of [Mg/H] shown in Figure 11 are similar\nto those in [Fe/H] for the same \u03c3 slices through the colormagnitude relation. In addition to the total increase in\n[Mg/H] with \u03c3, the brightest galaxies at fixed \u03c3 have the\nhighest values of [Mg/H]. However, [Mg/H] shows less\nvariation at fixed \u03c3 than does [Fe/H], particularly in the\nhigh\u2013\u03c3 bins. This is as expected from Figure 6. Although\nthe spread in [Mg/H] at fixed \u03c3 seen here and in Figure 6\nis small, Figure 11 strongly suggests that these variations\nare in fact real because they are consistent across the \u03c3\nbins.\nFinally, Figure 12 shows \u03c3 slices overlaid with contours\nof constant [Mg/Fe], directly comparing the differences\n\n\f13\n\nFig. 10.- [Fe/H] as a function of \u03c3, L, and color. As in Figure 9, panels show the color-magnitude diagram for slices of fixed \u03c3.\nBlack points show galaxies included in the stacked spectra, while gray points show color and Mr outliers that have been excluded from\nthis analysis. Overplotted are contours of [Fe/H] derived from the stellar population modelling of \u00a74.4. [Fe/H] increases with increasing\n\u03c3. Lines of constant [Fe/H] run approximately vertically in color-magnitude space at fixed \u03c3, with the most luminous galaxies being the\nmost Fe-rich. When the various \u03c3 slices are stacked together into the observed color-magnitude relation, the increase in [Fe/H] with L\nat fixed \u03c3 reinforces the increase in [Fe/H] with \u03c3, causing the L\u2013[Fe/H] relation to be tighter and steeper than the \u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] relation.\nComparisons with Figure 9 show that, at fixed \u03c3, age and [Fe/H] are roughly anti-correlated, helping to preserve the tightness of the total\ncolor\u2013\u03c3 relation.\n\nin Fe and Mg enrichment. Again, [Mg/Fe] increases with\nincreasing \u03c3, as expected from Figure 6. Like [Mg/H],\nthe variation at fixed \u03c3 is mild and therefore somewhat\nmore difficult to categorize than the variation in age and\n[Fe/H], but broadly [Mg/Fe] behaves similarly to age,\nshowing larger enhancements in fainter galaxies at fixed\n\u03c3. Because Mg is produced by supernovae Type II (SNe\nII) on short timescales while Fe is produced by supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) on longer timescales, the observed overabundance of Mg relative to the solar abundance pattern is typically interpreted to indicate a short\ntimescale for star formation, leaving the stellar population of the galaxy enhanced in SN II products but not in\nSN Ia products.\nThese maps of age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe]\nacross the color-magnitude relation confirm that quiescent galaxies form a multi-parameter family in stellar population properties. Age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and\n[Mg/Fe] all increase with \u03c3, but show variations at fixed\n\u03c3 depending on their L. Of the four stellar population\n\nparameters presented in Figures 9\u201312, only age shows a\nstrong dependence on color as well as L. Variations in\nage and [Mg/Fe] with L at fixed \u03c3 are similar (both increase toward fainter galaxies) and are opposite to the\nvariations in [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] (both of which increase\ntoward brighter galaxies). This suggests that the oldest galaxies in the universe formed their stars over short\ntimescales, while younger quiescent galaxies experienced\nmore extended star formation.\nUsing these stellar population maps, the differing\ntrends with \u03c3 and with L illustrated in Figures 6 and\n7 can be understood by superposing the various \u03c3 slices\nof the color-magnitude relation. Although we have seen\nthat age and [Fe/H] both increase with \u03c3, Figures 9 and\n10 show that age and [Fe/H] exhibit opposite behavior\nfrom one another at fixed \u03c3, namely that age decreases\nand [Fe/H] increases for brighter galaxies at fixed \u03c3. Because of this difference, superposing the various \u03c3 slices\nto form the total color-magnitude relation acts to reinforce the \u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] relation into an even tighter L\u2013[Fe/H]\n\n\f14\n\nGraves et al.\n\nFig. 11.- [Mg/H] as a function of \u03c3, L, and color.

Black points\nshows galaxies included in the stacked spectra, while gray points show color and Mr outliers that have been excluded from this analysis.\nOverplotted are contours of [Mg/H] derived from the stellar population modelling of \u00a74.4. Mg is used to trace \u03b1-elements, thus contours\nof [Mg/H] here are a proxy for contours of [\u03b1/H]. [Mg/H] increases with increasing \u03c3, showing the least variation at fixed \u03c3 of any of\nthe stellar population parameters. In the lower\u2013\u03c3 bins, [Mg/H] behaves similarly to [Fe/H], with lines of constant [Mg/H] running nearly\nvertically in color\u2013magnitude space.\n\nrelation. At the same time, the age trends at fixed \u03c3\ncounteract the \u03c3\u2013age relation, resulting in almost no L\u2013\nage relation. The explains why stellar population studies\nas a function of L or M\u2217 11 find weak or non-existant L\u2013\nage relations (e.g., Kuntschner & Davies 1998; Terlevich\n& Forbes 2002; Gallazzi et al. 2005), while stellar population studies as a function of \u03c3 turn up significant \u03c3\u2013age\ncorrelations (e.g., Bernardi et al. 2003b; Thomas et al.\n2005; Nelan et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2007a; Graves et al.\n2007).\nIn this scenario, although the L\u2013[Fe/H] correlation is\nstronger than the \u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] correlation, we interpret the\n\u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] trend as the primary relation, with the increased tightness of the L\u2013[Fe/H] relation being caused\nby correlated residuals from the \u03c3\u2013L and \u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] relations. In the next section, we use principal components\nanalysis to show that the family of stellar populations\nin quiescent galaxies is nearly two-dimensional, with the\nfirst dimension parameterized by \u03c3 and the second di11 M is closely related to L because red sequence galaxies span\n\u2217\nonly a very limited range in M\u2217 /L\n\nmension parameterized by correlated residuals from the\nvarious \u03c3\u2013L, \u03c3\u2013color, and \u03c3\u2013stellar population trends.\n5.3. Principal Components Analysis and Stellar\n\nPopulation Residuals\nTo quantitatively explore the multi-dimensional space\nof global and stellar population parameters illustrated\nin the previous section, we have performed a principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA; see, e.g., Faber 1973; Trager\net al. 2000) in the seven dimensional space parameterized\nby \u03c3, L, color, age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe]. All parameters are \"standardized\" to have a mean of zero and\na variance of one before performing the PCA. The results\nare shown in Table 1. Although the parameter space is\nnominally seven dimensional, there are only six principal\ncomponents (PCs) because [Mg/H] \u2261 [Mg/Fe] + [Fe/H].\nThe first two PCs account for 91% of the variance in the\npopulation, indicating that the quiescent galaxy population can be well-described by a two-dimensional hyperplane.\nThe first PC (PC1) accounts for a full 70% of the ob-\n\n\f15\n\nFig. 12.- [Mg/Fe] as a function of \u03c3, L, and color. Panels show the color-magnitude diagram for slices of fixed \u03c3. Black points\nshows galaxies included in the stacked spectra, while gray points show color and Mr outliers that have been excluded from this analysis.\nOverplotted are contours of [Mg/Fe] derived from the stellar population modelling of \u00a74.4. Mg is used to trace \u03b1-elements, thus contours\nof [Mg/Fe] here are a proxy for contours of [\u03b1/Fe]. [Mg/Fe] increases with increasing \u03c3. There is limited variation in [Mg/Fe] at fixed \u03c3.\nA comparisons with Figure 9 shows that [Mg/Fe] varies similarly to age, such that fainter galaxies at fixed \u03c3 are older and have higher\n[Mg/Fe]. This variation runs in the opposite sense of variation in [Fe/H] at fixed \u03c3, which increases with increasing luminosity. When\nthe various \u03c3 slices are stacked together in the observed red sequence, the decrease of [Mg/Fe] with increasing L at fixed \u03c3 counter-acts\nthe trend of increasing [Mg/Fe] with increasing \u03c3, thus the \u03c3\u2013[Mg/Fe] relation is substantially weakened when L is used to parameterize\ngalaxies instead of \u03c3\n\nserved variation and is comprised of positive contributions from all of the input parameters. This illustrates\nquantitatively that all the parameters presented here are\ncorrelated with one another. We saw in \u00a73 that the colormagnitude relation is the result of fundamental \u03c3-color\nand \u03c3-magnitude relations. It therefore seems reasonable\nto treat \u03c3 as the primary global parameter behind PC1.\nThe second PC (PC2) encompasses another 21% of the\nvariance and includes significant contributions from all\nparameters except for \u03c3. PC2 therefore represents the\ncorrelated residuals from the mean relations between \u03c3\nand the other parameters. The contributions of g\u2212r, age,\nand [Mg/Fe] to PC2 are positive while those of L, [Fe/H],\nand [Mg/H] are negative. This indicates that at fixed \u03c3,\ng \u2212 r, age, and [Mg/Fe] are correlated with one another\nand are anti-correlated with L, [Fe/H], and [Mg/H]. Of\nthe global parameters, L contributes the most to PC2.\n5.4. Stellar Population Residuals from \u03c3 Relations\n\nResiduals in the four stellar population parameters\n(\u2206 log age, \u2206[Fe/H], \u2206[Mg/H], and \u2206[Mg/Fe]) are defined as the difference between the observed values and\nthe mean relations with \u03c3, as indicated by the dashed\nlines in Figure 6. The correlated stellar population residuals associated with PC2 are shown in Figure 13. In each\npanel, high and low S/N data are indicated by filled and\nopen circles, respectively. The error ellipses in the lower\nleft corner of each panel indicate the stastical errors from\nthe stellar population modelling process, with solid black\n(dashed gray) lines showing the median statistical errors\nfor high (low) S/N data. Measurement errors in the index absorption line strengths produce correlated errors\nin the derived stellar population parameters. These are\ndetermined from Monte Carlo simulations in Graves &\nSchiavon (2008) and are indicated by the error ellipse\norientation. In all panels, residuals are color-coded by\nluminosity residuals; the green circles represent the central bin in L at fixed \u03c3 (centered on the median L for\n\n\f16\n\nGraves et al.\nTABLE 1\nPrincipal Component Analysis\nPC1\n\nPC2\n\nPC3\n\nPC4\n\nPC5\n\nPC6\n\nlog \u03c3\nlog La\ng\u2212r\nlog Age\n[Fe/H]\n[Mg/H]\n[Mg/Fe]\n\nParameter\n\n0.43\n0.37\n0.40\n0.32\n0.32\n0.43\n0.36\n\n0.03\n\u22120.40\n0.23\n0.53\n\u22120.55\n\u22120.21\n0.39\n\n0.31\n0.04\n\u22120.62\n\u22120.33\n\u22120.22\n0.14\n0.59\n\n0.37\n0.59\n\u22120.25\n0.32\n\u22120.29\n\u22120.40\n\u22120.34\n\n\u22120.53\n0.58\n0.32\n\u22120.27\n\u22120.33\n\u22120.08\n0.31\n\n0.55\n\u22120.14\n0.50\n\u22120.57\n\u22120.21\n\u22120.21\n\u22120.11\n\nEigenvalue\nPercentage of variance\nCumulative percentage\n\n4.88\n69.7\n69.7\n\n1.49\n21.3\n91.0\n\n0.35\n5.0\n96.0\n\n0.18\n2.6\n98.6\n\n0.07\n1.0\n99.6\n\n0.03\n0.4\n100.0\n\nNote. - Parameters are \"standardized\" to have a mean of zero and a\nvariance of one before performing PCA.

This\nanti-correlation at fixed \u03c3 has been reported by numerous previous authors (e.g., Worthey et al. 1995; Colless\net al. 1999; J\u00f8rgensen 1999; Trager et al. 2000) and was\nquantified by Trager et al. (2000) as the \"metallicity hyperplane\". The anti-correlation conspires to keep the\ncolor\u2013\u03c3 relation tight (c.f., Figure 4). In contrast to the\nobserved age\u2013[Fe/H] anti-correlation at fixed \u03c3, we saw\nin Figure 7 that at fixed L, there is significant scatter in\nage but almost no scatter in [Fe/H] (although see Poggianti et al. 200112). This implies that age differences\nwill produce color variations at fixed L which cannot\nbe offset by correlated variations in [Fe/H]. Thus, the\ncolor-magnitude relation should show more color variation at fixed L than is observed in the color-\u03c3 relation at\nfixed \u03c3, consistent with Figures 3 and 4. Furthermore,\nthe observed color spread in the color-magnitude relation should correlate with age, such that bluer galaxies\nare younger than redder galaxies at fixed L. This is consistent with Figure 9 and also with the results of Cool\net al. (2006).\nIn addition to the age\u2013[Fe/H] anti-correlation evident\nin Figure 13a, a similar anti-correlation is present between age and [Mg/H] (Figure 13c), although it is significantly weaker. A further anti-correlation is observed\nbetween [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] (Figure 13b), such that Fepoor galaxies are more Mg-enhanced than their comparitively Fe-rich counterparts at fixed \u03c3. Finally, Figure 13d\nshows a positive correlation between age and [Mg/Fe],\n12 Unlike the results shown in Figure 7, Poggianti et al. (2001)\nfind a range of metallicity at fixed L, which they observe to be anticorrelated with age. Their results may differ from ours because\nwe have averaged over a large number of galaxies in each stacked\nspectrum, washing out genuine [Fe/H] variation at fixed L and\n\u03c3, or the observed age-metallicity correlation in their data may\nbe due to an underestimate of the correlated errors in the stellar\npopulation modelling process.\n\nsuch that older galaxies are more Mg-enhanced with respect to the solar abundance pattern than their younger\ncounterparts at fixed \u03c3.\nIn panels a\u2013c, the slopes of the observed anticorrelations are similar to those expected from correlated\nerrors in stellar population modelling, as indicated by the\nerror ellipses. However, the observed anti-correlations\ncannot be due to correlated statistical errors for several reasons. Firstly, the typical statistical errors are too\nsmall to produce the observed spread in stellar population properties. More conclusively, if the observed anticorrelations were due to measurement errors, they would\nnot be systematically correlated with \u2206L. The observed\nL\u2013dependence of stellar population properties at fixed \u03c3\nargues strongly that the anti-correlation is real. In appendix B, we verify that the observed anti-correlations\nare not due to systematic effects in the stellar population\nmodelling process caused by using single burst models to\nfit integrated galaxy spectra, which are almost certainly\nnot single burst populations.\nIt is evident from Figure 13 that, not only are the\nvarious stellar population residuals correlated with one\nanother, they are also strongly correlated with \u2206L, as\nquantified by the PCA analysis in the previous section.\nCollecting all parameters together, the residual trends\ncan be summarized as follows: at fixed \u03c3, galaxies fainter\nthan the median are older, Fe-poor, somewhat Mg-poor,\nand more Mg-enhanced than typical galaxies at that \u03c3,\nwhile galaxies brighter than the median are younger, Ferich, somewhat Mg-rich, and less Mg-enhanced.\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown that (1) stellar population age, [Fe/H],\n[Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] all increase with increasing galaxy\n\u03c3 (Figure 6), and (2) that the star formation histories of\ngalaxies vary systematically at fixed \u03c3 such that fainter\ngalaxies are older, Fe-poor, and Mg-enhanced compared\nto their bright counterparts at the same \u03c3 (Figure 13).\nThe first of these results is in agreement with a substantial number of earlier works (e.g, Bernardi et al. 2003b;\nThomas et al. 2005; Nelan et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2007a;\nGraves et al. 2007). In particular, the increase in age with\n\n\f17\n\nFig. 13.- Correlated residuals in stellar population parameters at fixed \u03c3. Residuals \u2206 log Age, \u2206[Fe/H], \u2206[Mg/H], and \u2206[Mg/Fe] were\ncomputed by subtracting off the trends with \u03c3 (dashed lines in Figure 6) from the observed values. Data are color-coded by luminosity bin\n(\u2206L) as indicated. Filled (open) circles show high (low) S/N data, while solid (dashed) error ellipses show the corresponding correlated\nerrors from stellar population modelling. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs ) is indicated for each pair of residuals. Residuals\nfrom the mean relations with \u03c3 are related such that residuals in age and [Mg/Fe] are correlated with one another and are anti-correlated\nwith residuals in [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. These correlated residuals are also correlated with \u2206L, such that the brighter galaxies (blue points)\nat a given \u03c3 have lower ages, lower [Mg/Fe], higher [Fe/H], and higher [Mg/H] than their fainter counterparts (red points). Although the\nresiduals are in many cases correlated in the same direction as the correlated errors from stellar population modelling, the relation between\nthe stellar population residuals and \u2206L could not be produced by stellar population modelling errors and indicates that the residual\ncorrelations are real.\n\n\u03c3 is consistent with \"archeological downsizing\" (Thomas\net al. 2005), in which massive galaxies form their stars\npredominantly at early times, while lower mass galaxies\nshow evidence of younger stellar populations.\nThe anti-correlation of age and [Fe/H] at fixed \u03c3 shown\nin this analysis is not a new result and is in agreement\nwith the metallicity hyperplane of Trager et al. (2000)\nand with the recent work of Smith et al. (2007b) for individual galaxies. However, an important new result of\nthis work is that this anti-correlation is correlated with\ngalaxy luminosity, such that the more luminous galaxies at fixed \u03c3 are the younger, Fe-rich galaxies while the\nfainter galaxies are older and more Fe-poor. This confirms that the observed anti-correlation of age and [Fe/H]\nmust be genuine, rather than an effect of correlated stellar population modelling errors.\n\nThe co-variation of age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe] we observe at fixed \u03c3 cannot be driven by large-scale environment. The age\u2013[Fe/H] anti-correlation is observed separately in the Trager et al. (2000) data, which include only\nfield galaxies, and in the Smith et al. (2007b) data, which\ninclude only cluster galaxies. It is also observed in our\nstacked spectra, which average over all environments.\nThe observed co-variation of age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe]\nis qualitatively consistent with a scenario in which all\ngalaxies at the same \u03c3 start forming stars at the same\nz but the duration of star formation varies between\ngalaxies. At fixed \u03c3, galaxies with short star formation timescales end star formation early and consequently\nhave older mean stellar ages. They also have less time for\nenrichment in SN Ia products, resulting in lower [Fe/H]\nand higher [Mg/Fe]. To the extent that \u03c3 measures the\n\n\f18\n\nGraves et al.\n\ndepth of the gravitational potential, the loss of metals\nthrough winds should be consistent for all galaxies at\nthe same \u03c3 if they experience comparable galactic winds.\nThus early truncation of star formation should have little\neffect on [Mg/H] but should result in a genuine underabundance of [Fe/H], as observed. To also be consistent with the general trends of Figure 6, these variations\nin the duration of star formation must be superimposed\non a staged star formation model, similar to the Noeske\net al. (2007) model, where the redshift at which star formation peaks and the duration of star formation depend\non \u03c3. Unlike the Noeske model, the data presented here\nadditionally require a spread in star formation duration\nat fixed \u03c3. A quantitative test of such a model requires\nthe construction of chemical evolution models, which we\ndefer to future work. Furthermore, this scenario postulates a range of star formation timescales at fixed \u03c3 but\ndoes not propose a physical mechanism to produce the\nobserved variation.\nA key result of this analysis is that the co-variation of\nage, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe] at fixed \u03c3 also correlates with\ngalaxy luminosity, such that the brighter galaxies are\nyounger, Fe-rich, and less \u03b1-enhanced than the fainter\ngalaxies at the same \u03c3. If the above scenario is correct,\nthe more luminous galaxies at fixed \u03c3 would be those\nwhich experienced more extended star formation histories. This at first appears to be a trivial result, since\ngalaxies with more extended star formation and younger\nmean ages are expected to have lower M/L and therefore\nhigher L at fixed \u03c3. However, the differences in M/L\npredicted from stellar population models are too small\nto account for the observed variation in L. This will be\nshown in detail in future papers in this series, but can\nalso be inferred from Figure 3. This figure shows that\nthe range in galaxy colors at fixed \u03c3 is small, suggesting that the range of M/L is likewise small. In fact,\nthe variation in L at fixed \u03c3 turns out to be dominated\nby variation in total stellar mass at fixed \u03c3, while M/L\nvariations contribute only a modest amount. Thus any\nphysical mechanism invoked to explain the observed covariation in stellar population properties at fixed \u03c3 must\nalso reproduce differing total stellar mass content in the\ngalaxies.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis analysis has used very high S/N stacked spectra of \u223c 16, 000 SDSS early type galaxies to map out\nvariations in stellar population age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and\n[Mg/Fe] with galaxy \u03c3, L, and color. In addition to\nstudying the mean trends in stellar populations with\neach of these three global properties individually, we\nhave mapped out variations in age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and\n[Mg/Fe] in the three dimensional \u03c3\u2013L\u2013color parameter\nspace. This allows us to understand the differing behavior of stellar populations as a function of \u03c3 versus L, and\nto explore the systematic variations in stellar populations\nat fixed \u03c3.\nWe find the following results for quiescent galaxies:\n1. Luminosity and \u03c3 both increase with galaxy mass,\nyet these \"size\" measures are not the same. Fundamental stellar population variables such as age,\n[Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] scale differently with\nrespect to L and to \u03c3, and also with respect to\ngalaxy color.\n\n2. Higher \u03c3 galaxies are typically more luminous and\nredder than lower \u03c3 galaxies. However, at fixed \u03c3,\nthere is no color\u2013magnitude relation, despite the\nsubstantial variation in Mr . The color-magnitude\nrelation of passive galaxies is therefore a result of\ncombining the \u03c3\u2013L and \u03c3\u2013color relations, in agreement with Bernardi et al. (2005).\n3. Mean luminosity-weighted stellar population age,\n[Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] all correlate with \u03c3\nsuch that galaxies with higher \u03c3 tend to be older\nand have higher [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe]. At\nfixed \u03c3, the spread in [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe] is small,\nwhile both [Fe/H] and age show significant spread.\n4. At fixed \u03c3, brighter galaxies have lower age,\nhigher [Fe/H], slightly higher [Mg/H], and lower\n[Mg/Fe] than their fainter counterparts. The anticorrelation of age and [Fe/H] conspires to keep the\ncolor\u2013magnitude relation flat at fixed \u03c3 and contributes to the overall narrowness of the color\u2013\u03c3\nrelation.\n5. At fixed \u03c3, age is also correlated with color such\nthat younger galaxies are both brighter and bluer\nat fixed \u03c3 than the fainter, redder, older galaxies.\nIn contrast, [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] do not vary systematically with color, while [Mg/Fe] varies only\nmildly with color.\n6. The variation in stellar population properties with\nL at fixed \u03c3 acts to reinforce the \u03c3\u2013[Fe/H] trend,\nresulting in a strong and tight L\u2013[Fe/H] correlation. In contrast, the \u03c3\u2013age and \u03c3\u2013[Mg/Fe] correlations are opposed by the variations with L at\nfixed \u03c3, leaving only weak L\u2013age and L\u2013[Mg/Fe]\ncorrelations. In a similar way, residuals in color correlate with stellar population properties such that\nthere is a strong color\u2013age trend but only weak\ncolor\u2013[Fe/H] and color\u2013[Mg/Fe] trends. Age correlates most closely with color, [Fe/H] correlates most\nclosely with L, and [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe] correlate\nmost closely with \u03c3. Only \u03c3 (and not L or color)\ncorrelates strongly with all four stellar population\nproperties.\n7. Trends in age, [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] at fixed\n\u03c3 are likely not driven by environment. The age\u2013\n[Fe/H] anti-correlation at fixed \u03c3 is detected in\nsamples of individual galaxies which reside in similar environments (e.g., the field galaxies in Trager\net al. 2000 and the cluster galaxies in Smith et al.\n2007b) and also in our sample of stacked spectra,\nwhich average over all environments.\nThe variations in stellar population properties at fixed\n\u03c3 presented here illustrate that the narrow, seemingly\none-dimensional color magnitude relation of quiescent\ngalaxies conceals an underlying set of star formation histories that populate a two-parameter family. Not only\ndo the star formation histories of galaxies vary systematically with their \u03c3, but there is clearly a range of processes at work in galaxies of the same \u03c3. These result\nin an anti-correlation between galaxy age and [Fe/H] at\nfixed \u03c3 and a weaker but positive age\u2013[Mg/Fe] correlation. Moreover, these properties are linked to the present\n\n\f19\nday luminosities of the galaxies, such that brighter galaxies are younger, more metal-rich, and less \u03b1-enhanced\nthan fainter galaxies at the same \u03c3. The companion papers in this series will explore in more detail the connection between galaxy structure and galaxy stellar populations, providing evidence for the ways in which the\nstar formation history of a galaxy is linked to its mass\nassembly and structural evolution.\nThe authors would like to thank Renbin Yan for providing the emission line measurements used to identify\nthe sample of early-type galaxies used here, as well as\nan anonymous referee for provided valuable feedback.\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation grant AST 05-07483.\nFunding for the creation and distribution of the SDSS\nArchive has been provided by the Alred P.

DE VAUCOULEURS MAGNITUDES AND COLORS\nThis analysis is based on magnitudes and colors measured from de Vaucouleur fits to the galaxy light profiles.\nHowever, given that a fraction of the galaxies in the sample have a visible disk component it is important to verify\nthat the de Vaucouleurs magnitudes and colors are a reasonable approximation to the total galaxy magnitudes and\ncolors.\nThe Petrosian magnitudes measured by the SDSS pipeline have larger errors (typically 5% in the r-band) than the de\nVaucouleurs model fits (typically 2% in the r-band) as determined by repeat observations of targeted galaxies. However,\nthey have the benefit of being independent of the galaxy light profile. We compare Petrosian r-band magnitudes to\nthe de Vaucouleurs magnitudes used in our analysis and find that the de Vaucouleurs magnitudes are systematically\nbrighter by < 0.1 mag (consistent with Blanton et al. 2001), with rms scatter of 0.04 mag. This scatter is much\nsmaller than the 0.8 mag bin widths used to sort and stack galaxy spectra and should therefore have little impact on\nthe analysis presented here.\nColor effects may be more important, both because the color differences observed in our sample galaxies are intrinsically small and because disk galaxies may exhibit substantial color gradients. We combine the separate de Vaucouleurs\nand exponential fits to galaxy light profiles, weighting each component by the fractional contribution of each component (the SDSS pipeline value fracDeV) to produce composite bulge + disk galaxy magnitudes and colors. We\ncompare the g \u2212 r colors from the bulge + disk models to the de Vaucouleurs profile colors in Figure A1. In the\ntop panel we show the distribution of color differences for all galaxies that go into our stacked spectra (i.e., after\nthe color- and magnitude-outliers have been removed from each \u03c3 bin). The majority of galaxies show < 0.001 mag\ndifference between the composite and de Vaucouleur color values because the galaxies are highly bulge-dominated.\nRemoving these and examining the distribution of color differences for galaxies with color differences larger than 0.001\nmag (bottom panel), we find that the distribution is roughly gaussian, with \u03bc = 0.0015 mag and \u03c3 = 0.0069 mag.\nGiven that the rms error for g \u2212 r color photometry in SDSS is \u223c 2% (0.022 mag, dotted lines in Figure A1), the\ncolor differences from the different model light profiles are within this error for > 97% of our galaxy sample. We\ntherefore conclude that the use of de Vaucouleurs model fits for the magnitudes and colors in this analysis does not\nhave a significant effect on the results.\n\n\f21\n\nFig. B1.- Stellar population model grid showing the effect of adding a young burst to an underlying old population. The model grid\nis for a solar-scale abundance pattern model from Schiavon (2007). Solid (dotted) lines connect models with the same [Fe/H] (age). The\ngray track shows the effect of taking an old population with age = 14.1 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -0.4, and adding to it varying fractions of a\n1.2 Gyr burst with the same [Fe/H]. Gray diamonds indicate the fraction of the total luminosity at 5000\u00c5 provided by the young burst,\nstarting at 0% at the bottom and increasing in increments of 5%. Index values from the stacked spectra are overplotted as triangles, with\ncolors indicating the \u03c3 range of the stacked spectrum, as in Figure 3 (purple shows the lowest \u03c3 bin, red the highest \u03c3 bin). The three\ndata points at fixed \u03c3 show the three different bins in L. The age\u2013[Fe/H] anticorrelation observed at fixed \u03c3 cannot simply be due to the\npresence of a young sub-population in the brighter galaxies because the trajectory of a young burst at constant [Fe/H] is nearly orthogonal\nto the observed co-variation of hFei and H\u03b2 at fixed \u03c3. The brighter galaxies must have higher average [Fe/H] than their faint counterparts\nat the same \u03c3, in addition to having younger mean ages.\n\nTHE EFFECT OF YOUNG SUB-POPULATIONS\nBecause the observed age\u2013[Fe/H] anti-correlation at fixed \u03c3 is in the same sense as the age-metallicity degeneracies\nthat plague stellar population studies, it is necessary to confirm that systematic errors in the modelling process are\nnot producing a spurious anti-correlation. We showed in \u00a713 that the age\u2013[Fe/H] anti-correlation at fixed \u03c3 is not due\nto random observational errors. However, the models used in this work are single stellar population (SSP) models,\nwhereas galaxies are composite populations with extended star formation histories. The mean age measured from\nan SSP model is a mean luminosity-weighted age for all the stars contributing to the total light. Because young\npopulations have lower mass-to-light ratios and stronger Balmer absorption lines, a sub-population of intermediate\nage stars (either a younger sub-population within individual galaxies or a subset of significantly younger galaxies in\nthe bin) will contribute disproportionately to the total galaxy light, skewing the SSP age to low values. If the young\nsub-population greatly strengthens the Balmer absorption lines without changing the Fe absorption lines much, the\nresulting model grid inversion may infer higher metallicities just due to the stronger Balmer lines rather than a genuine\ndifference in metallicity.\nThis is in the correct sense to account for the anti-correlation we see between galaxy age and [Fe/H] at fixed \u03c3.\nHowever, it alone cannot account for metallicity differences at fixed \u03c3, as illustrated in Figure B1. This figure shows a\nstellar population model grid for the hFei and H\u03b2 indices. Solid lines connect models of constant [Fe/H], while dotted\nlines connect models of constant age. Triangles show the index measurements for stacked spectra in this work, with\ncolors indicating the \u03c3 range represented (purple shows the lowest \u03c3 bin, red the highest \u03c3 bin, as in Figure 3). We\nhave averaged over the three different color bins so the three points shown for each \u03c3 bin represent three different\nsub-bins in L. The gray track with diamonds shows the effect of adding a young sub-population to an underlying old\npopulation. The old population has age = 14.1 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -0.4, while the young sub-population has the same\n[Fe/H] and age = 1.2 Gyr. Gray diamonds indicate the fraction of the total luminosity at 5000 \u00c5 provided by the\nburst, starting at 0% at the bottom and increasing in increments of 5%.\nIt is clear that the trajectory in index-index space covered by composite burst models with fixed [Fe/H] is very\ndifferent from the observed co-variation in galaxy age and [Fe/H]. It is true that the [Fe/H] inferred for a composite\nburst would be skewed slightly high, since the gray track in Figure B1 lies consistently to the right of the [Fe/H] =\n-0.4 grid line despite the fact that both sub-populations in the composite models have [Fe/H] = -0.4. However, the\neffect is small compared to the observed variation in hFei at fixed \u03c3 in the galaxy sample. The data therefore require\ngenuine variations in mean [Fe/H] at fixed \u03c3, in addition to age variations.\n\n\f22\n\nGraves et al.\nTABLE C1\nProperties of Galaxy Bins and Stacked
