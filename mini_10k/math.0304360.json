We\napply this to the case where H T = H and the stabilizer is a symmetric subgroup, a case\ndiscussed for the continuous wavelet transform in [8].\n\nIntroduction\nThe wavelet transform, and more generally time frequency analysis, has become a widely\nused and studied tool in mathematics, physics, engineering, and applied science during\nthe last decade. One of the interesting aspect is the role played by abstract harmonic\nanalysis and representation theory of locally compact groups. In wavelet theory one\nstudies square integrable representations of semidirect products G = Rn \u00d7s H, and in\ntime frequency analysis representations of the Heisenberg group are used to understand\nGabor frames build from a lattice \u0393 \u2282 R2d . In this article we will discuss frames built\nfrom the continuous wavelet transform and discrete subsets \u0393 of G.\nIn the language of representation theory the continuous wavelet transform on the line\nis given by taking the matrix coefficients of the natural representation \u03c0 of the (ax + b)group, i.e., the group of dilations and translations on the line, on the Hilbert space L2 (R).\nThus\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx\u2212b\n\u22121/2\n\u03c0(a, b)\u03c8(x) = |a|\n\u03c8\n= Tb Da \u03c8(x)\na\nand\n(0.1)\n\nW\u03c8 (f )(a, b) = (f | \u03c0(a, b)\u03c8) = |a|\n\n\u22121/2\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nf (x)\u03c8(\n\nx\u2212b\n) dx .\na\n\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 42C40,43A85.\nKey words and phrases.

For the\ncontinuous wavelet transform the relation to representation theory of the (ax + b)-group\nwas already pointed out by Grossmann, Morlet, and Paul in 1985 [16, 17]. Since then\nseveral people have worked on wavelets related to actions of topological groups acting on\nRn . Without trying to be complete we would like to name the work of Ali, Antoine, and\nGazeau, [1, 2], Bernier and Taylor [4], F\u00fcr and F\u00fchr and Mayer [11, 12, 13, 14], and finally\nLaugesen, Weaver, Weiss, and Wilson [19]. In most of these cases the group generalizing\nthe (ax + b)-group is a semidirect product Rn \u00d7s H, where H is a closed subgroup of\nGL(n, R). For the continuous wavelet transform one often assumes that the group H has\nopen orbits O1 , . . . , Or such that the complement of their union has measure zero. As a\nfurther condition for the existence of wavelet functions, or admissible functions, one needs\nthat for \u03c9 in an open orbit the stabilizer\nH \u03c9 = {h \u2208 H | (h\u22121 )T (\u03c9) = \u03c9}\nis compact. In [8] the case where this condition is not satisfied were discussed. Instead\nit was assumed that H is reductive, H T = H, and that the stabilizer group H \u03c9 is a\nsymmetric subgroup, i.e., there exits an involutive automorphism \u03c4 : H \u2192 H such that\nHo\u03c4 \u2282 H \u03c9 \u2282 H \u03c4 . For any given open orbit O we then able to construct a group Q =\nANR \u2282 H such that the following holds:\n(1) There exists points \u03c90 , . . . , \u03c9k \u2208 O such that the Q-orbits Oj = QT (\u03c9j ), 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k,\nare open and O \\ (O1 \u222a . . . Ok ) has measure zero.\n(2) The group Q has the form ANR where A is simply connected and abelian, N is\nsimply connected and unipotent, and R is compact and containing the stabilizer\nof \u03c9j , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k. In particular the stabilizer of \u03c9j in Q is compact.\nOur aim in this article is to use the special structure of the group Q = ANR listed\nabouve, to construct frames for L2 (Rn ) generalizing (0.2). Our ideas are based on the\narticle [4] by Bernier and Taylor , but it should be pointed out that seveal of the ideas\n\n\fGROUPS AND FRAMES\n\n3\n\nin [4] are based on privious work of others. We would like to mention the article by\nDaubechies, Grossmann, and Meyer [7], the work of Feichtinger and Gr\u00f6chenig [10, 15],\nAl, Antoine, and Gazeau [2, 4], and finally the work of Heil and Walnut [18].\nIn [4] the authors considered a subgroup H \u2282 GL(n, R) as above and assume that\nH acts freely on Rn , i.e., the stabilizer group is trivial. Define an action of H on Rn\nby a * x = (a\u22121 )T (x). The authors introduced the notion of separated sets and frame\ngenerators. A separated set \u0393 is a subset of H such that there exist a compact set B \u2282 O,\nB o 6= \u2205, such that a * B \u2229 b * B 6= \u2205 implies that a = b. In particular all the translates aT B,\na \u2208 \u0393, of B are disjoint. A frame generator\nis a pair (\u0393, F) where \u0393 \u2282 H is separated and\nS\nF is a compact subset of O such that a\u2208\u0393 a*F = O. In [4] the author show, that if (\u0393, F) is\na frame generator, then there exist a function \u03c8 and a discrete set {v(m) \u2208 Rn | m \u2208 Zn }\nsuch that the set {\u03c0((a, v(m))\u22121 )\u03c8 | a \u2208 \u0393, m \u2208 Zn } is a frame for the Hilbert space of\nL2 -functions whose Fourier transform is supported in O.\nIn the first part of this article we show that the same construction can be carried out if\nthe action is not free, but the stabilizer group is compact. Motivated by the construction\nin [8] we apply this to groups of the form ANR as in (2) above except we do not need to\nassume that N is simply connected. The assumption needed is, that N contains a discrete\nsubgroup \u0393 such that \u0393\\N is compact. In this case we can carry out the construction by\nBernier and Taylor to get a frame related to an open ANR-orbit, c.f. Theorem 4.1 and\nTheorem 4.2. We recall in section 4 the construction from [8] and explain it using the\naction of GL(n, R) on the space of symmetric matrices.\nThen author would like to thank C. Heil and G. Weiss for helpfull comments and\ncorrections.\n1. Separated sets\nLet H be a closed subgroup of GL(n, R). Then H acts in a natural way on Rn . We\nwill also consider the action\n(h, v) 7\u2192 h * v := (h\u22121 )T (v)\nof H on Rn . Here aT denotes the transpose of the matrix a \u2208 GL(n, R). We denote\nby \u03b8 : Rn \u2192 Rn the homomorphism \u03b8(h) = (h\u22121 )T . For simplicity we will also write\nh\u03b8 = \u03b8(h). We assume that there exist an open orbit O \u2282 Rn under the twisted action\n(h, v) 7\u2192 h\u03b8 (v). For \u03c9 \u2208 O let\nH \u03c9 := {h \u2208 H | h * \u03c9 = \u03c9}\nbe the stabilizer of \u03c9 in H. Notice that H \u03c9 = {h \u2208 H | hT (v) = v} as H \u03c9 is a subgroup\nof H. Because of the applications that we have in mind, we assume from now on that H \u03c9\nis compact. The following definition is from [4]:\nDefinition 1.1. Let H be a locally compact Hausdorff topological group acting on the\nlocally compact Hausdorff topological space X. A subset \u0393 \u2282 H is called separated if\nthere exist a compact set B \u2282 X such that B o 6= \u2205 and h * B \u2229 k * B = \u2205 for all h, k \u2208 \u0393,\nh 6= k. We then say that \u0393 is separated by B.\n\n\f4\n\nG. \u00d3LAFSSON\n\nExample 1.2. Let H = R+ SO(n). Let A \u2282 SO(n) be a non-empty subset and let \u03bb > 1.\n\u0393 := {\u03bbk a | k \u2208 Z, a \u2208 A} .\nLet 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 be such that \u03bb\u03b1 > \u03b2 and define\nB = {v \u2208 Rn | \u03b1 \u2264 kvk \u2264 \u03b2} .\nThen B is compact with non-empty interior. If b = \u03bbk a \u2208 \u0393 then\nb * B = {v \u2208 Rn | \u03bb\u2212k \u03b1 \u2264 kvk \u2264 \u03bb\u2212k \u03b2} .\nSuppose that k \u2264 m and that \u03bbk SO(n) * B \u2229 \u03bbmSO(n) * B. Then \u03bb\u2212k \u03b1 \u2264 \u03bb\u2212m \u03b2 and, hence,\n\u03bbm\u2212k \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2\nwhich is only possible if m \u2212 k = 0. It follows that \u0393 is separated by B.\nFix from now on \u03c90 \u2208 O and recall that we are assuming that L := {h \u2208 H | hT (\u03c90 ) =\n\u03c90 } is compact. We can always assume that \u03c90 \u2208 B o . Otherwise take b \u2208 H such that\nb * \u03c90 \u2208 B o . Thus \u03c90 = b\u22121 * B. Let \u0393\u2032 := \u0393b and B \u2032 := b\u22121 * B. Then for h, k \u2208 \u0393, h 6= k\nwe have\n(hb) * (b\u22121 * B) \u2229 (kb) * (b\u22121 * B) = h * B \u2229 k * B = \u2205\nso that \u0393\u2032 is separated by B \u2032 .\nLemma 1.3. Let L = {h \u2208 H | h\u03b8 (\u03c90 ) = \u03c90 } and let \u03ba : H \u2192 O be the map h 7\u2192 h\u03b8 (\u03c90 )\nthat defines an H-isomorphism H/L \u2243 O. Let B \u2282 O be compact. Then B\u0303 := \u03ba\u22121 (B) \u2282\nH is a right L-invariant compact subset of H such that \u03ba(B\u0303) = B. Furthermore the\nfollowing holds:\n(1) \u03c90 \u2208 B if and only if e \u2208 B\u0303;\n(2) B o 6= \u2205 if and only if B\u0303 o 6= \u2205;\n(3) If B\u0303 o 6= \u2205 then \u03ba(B\u0303 o ) = B o and B\u0303 o is right L-invariant.\nProof. All of this is well know, but let us go over the argument here. That B\u0303L = B\u0303\nfollows from the fact that \u03ba(ab) = a\u03b8 (\u03ba(b)) = (ab) * \u03c90 .\n(a) follows by \u03ba(e) = \u03c90 .\n(b) and (c) follows from the fact that \u03ba is open and continuous.\nWe can assume that e \u2208 B\u0303. Then L \u2282 B\u0303. Let V \u2282 H be an open neighborhood of e\nsuch that V\u0304 is compact. Then \u03ba(V ) \u2282 O is open and\n[\nB\u2282\ng * \u03ba(V ) .\ng\u2208H\n\nHence, there are finitely many g1 , . . . , gn such that\nB\u2282\n\nn\n[\n\nj=1\n\ngj * \u03ba(V ) .\n\n\fGROUPS AND FRAMES\n\n5\n\nLet S := \u222anj=1 gj V . Then S is compact and B \u2282 \u03ba(S). It follows that B\u0303 \u2282 SL. But SL is\ncompact as the continuous image of the compact set S \u00d7 L \u2282 H \u00d7 H under the continuous\nmap H \u00d7 H \u2192 H, (a, b) 7\u2192 ab. As B\u0303 is closed it follows that B\u0303 is compact.\n\u0003\nLemma 1.4. Let \u0393 \u2282 H be a separated set. Let D \u2282 O be compact. Let S = \u03ba\u22121 (D).\nThen for each a \u2208 \u0393:\n#{b \u2208 \u0393 | a * D \u2229 b * D 6= \u2205} = #{b \u2208 \u0393 | aS \u2229 bS 6= \u2205} .\nProof. We have\n\u03ba(aS \u2229 bS) = a\u03b8 (D) \u2229 b\u03b8 (D) .\nHence, if aS \u2229 bS 6= \u2205 then a\u03b8 (D) \u2229 b\u03b8 (D) 6= \u2205 and it follows that the right hand side is\ngreater or equal to the left hand side. Assume now that x \u2208 a\u03b8 (D) \u2229 b\u03b8 (D). Then there\nexists s, t \u2208 S such that \u03ba(as) = \u03ba(bt). Hence, there exist h \u2208 L such that as = bth. As\nSL = S it follows that aS \u2229 bS 6= \u2205 and, hence,\n#{b \u2208 \u0393 | a * D \u2229 b * D 6= \u2205} \u2264 #{b \u2208 \u0393 | aS \u2229 bS 6= \u2205}\nfinishing the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe have now the necessary tools to prove the main results of this section.\nTheorem 1.5. Suppose that \u0393 \u2282 H and that B \u2282 O. Let B\u0303 = \u03ba\u22121 (B). Then \u0393 is\nseparated by B in O if and only of \u0393 is separated by B\u0303 in H under the natural action of\nH on H given by left multiplication.\nProof. We have already seen that B\u0303 is compact with B\u0303 o non-empty. Assume that aB\u0303 \u2229\nbB\u0303 6= \u2205 for some a, b \u2208 \u0393 then it follows by Lemma 1.4 that a * B \u2229 b * B 6= \u2205. Hence, a = b\nas \u0393 is separated by B.\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.6. Suppose that \u0393 \u2282 H is a separated subset of H. Let D \u2282 O be compact.\nThen\nsup #{h \u2208 \u0393 | h * D \u2229 k * D 6= \u2205} < \u221e .\nk\u2208\u0393\n\nProof. This has been proved in [4] for the case where the action of H is free. Using\nLemma 1.4 and Theorem 1.5 the general statement is reduced to that case and, hence,\nthe claim.\n\u0003\n2. The continuous wavelet transform\nIn this section we review some basic facts about the continuous wavelet transform on\nR with respect to a group action, see [8, 16, 17] for more information and references.\nDenote by Aff(Rn ) the group of invertable affine linear transformations on Rn . Then\nAff(Rn ) consists of pairs (x, h) such that h \u2208 GL(n, R) and x \u2208 Rn .

Thus\n(x, a)(y, b) = (a(y) + x, ab)\nand the inverse of (x, a) \u2208 Aff(Rn ) is given by\n(x, a)\u22121 = (\u2212a\u22121 (x), a\u22121 ) .\nThus Aff(Rn ) is the semidirect product of the abelian group Rn and the group GL(n, R);\nAff(Rn ) = Rn \u00d7s GL(n, R).\nDefine a unitary representation of Aff(Rn ) on L2 (Rn ) by\n(2.1)\n\n[\u03c0(x, a)f ](v) = | det(a)|\u22121/2 f ((x, a)\u22121 (v) = | det(a)|\u22121/2 f (a\u22121 (v \u2212 x)) .\n\nFor f \u2208 L2 (Rn ) denote by f\u02c6 the Fourier transform of f\nZ\n1\n\u02c6\nf (\u03c9) =\nf (x)e\u2212i(x|\u03c9) dx , f \u2208 L1 (Rn ) \u2229 L2 (Rn ) .\n(2\u03c0)n/2 Rn\n\nWe denote by \u03c0\u0302(x, a) the unitary action on L2 (Rn ) given by\np\np\n\u03c0\u0302(x, a)f (v) = | det(a)|e\u2212i(x|v) f (aT (v)) = | det(a)|e\u2212i(x|v) f (a\u22121 * v) .\nThe Fourier transform intertwines the representations \u03c0 and \u03c0\u0302 [8], Lemma 3.1:\n\nLemma 2.1. Let f \u2208 L2 (Rn ) and (x, a) \u2208 Aff(Rn ). Then\n\\\n\u03c0(x,\na)f (\u03c9) = \u03c0\u0302(x, a)f\u02c6(\u03c9) .\nLet H \u2282 GL(n, R) be a closed subgroup. Denote by G := Rn \u00d7s H the subgroup of\nAff(Rn ) given by\nG = {(x, a) \u2208 Aff(Rn ) | a \u2208 H} .\nWe assume that there exists open sets {Oj }j\u2208J, where J is a finite or countably infinite\nindex set, such that\n(W1) Each Oj is invariant and homogeneous under the action of H given by (a, v) 7\u2192\na * v = a\u03b8 (v);\n(W2) We have Oi \u2229 Oj = \u2205 if i 6= j;\n(W3) The complement of \u222aj\u2208J Oj has measure zero with respect to the Lebesgue measure\non Rn .\nFor a measureable function f denote by Supp(f ) the complement of the maximal open\nset U \u2282 Rn such that f (x) = 0 for almost all x \u2208 U. For \u2205 6= U open in Rn denote by\nL2U (Rn ) the closed subspace of L2 (Rn ) given by\n(2.2)\n\nL2U (Rn ) = {f \u2208 L2 (Rn ) | Supp(f\u02c6) \u2282 U } .\n\nSuppose that U is H-invariant under the twisted action h*v = h\u03b8 (v), then by 2.1, it follows\nthat L2U (Rn ) is G-invariant. Furthermore, by Theorem 3.4 in [8], L2U (Rn ) is irreducible if\n\n\fGROUPS AND FRAMES\n\n7\n\nand only if U is homogeneous. Hence, the decomposition of L2 (Rn ) into irreducible parts\nis given by\nM\n(2.3)\nL2 (Rn ) \u2243\nL2Oj (Rn ) .\nj\u2208J\n\nDenote by dh a left invariant Haar measure on H.

Then a nonzero function\n2\nn\nf \u2208 LOj (R ) is called admissible if \u03c0g,f (h) := (g | \u03c0(x, a)f ) is in L2 (G) for all g \u2208\nL2Oj (Rn ).\nA simple calculation, see [8], shows that\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2 dadx\n2\nn\n(2.4)\n|(g | \u03c0(x, a)f )|\n|f\u02c6(hT (\u03c9))|2 dhd\u03c9\n|\u011d(\u03c9)|\n= (2\u03c0)\n| det(a)|\nG\nH\nU\nR\nIn particular, if U is homogeneous, then Cf = H |f\u02c6(hT (\u03c9))|2 dh is independent of \u03c9 \u2208 U\nand, hence,\nZ\ndadx\n|(g | \u03c0(x, a)f )|2\n= Cf kgk2 .\n|\ndet(a)|\nG\n\nIn particular f is admissible if and only if H \u220b h 7\u2192 f (hT \u03c9) \u2208 C is in L2 (H), which in\nparticular implies that the condition\n(W4) For all \u03c9 \u2208 U we have that H \u03c9 = {h \u2208 H | hT (\u03c9) = \u03c9} is compact\nhas to be satisfied.\n3. Separated sets and Frames\nIn this section we recall some basic facts from [4] on how to construct frames from\nthe continuous wavelet transform using separating sets. Let us also recall that we are\nassuming that H \u2282 GL(n, R) is closed and that O is a homogeneous open subset of Rn\nsuch that the condition (W4) is satisfied.\nLet us start with the well known definition:\nDefinition 3.1. Let H be a Hilbert space. A sequence {vn } in H is called a frame if\nthere exits numbers A, B > 0 such that for all v \u2208 H we have\nX\n|(v | vn )|2 \u2264 Bkvk2 .\nAkvk2 \u2264\nn\n\nThe numbers A and B are called frame bounds.\n\nThe following definition is a simple generalisation of the definition by Bernier and Taylor\n[4]:\n\n\f8\n\nG. \u00d3LAFSSON\n\nDefinition 3.2. Let H be a locally compact Hausdorff topological group acting transitively on the locally compact Hausdorff topological space X. A frame generator is a\npair (\u0393, F) where \u0393 is a countable separated subset of H and F is a compact subset of X\nsuch that\n[\n(3.1)\nX=\na* F.\na\u2208\u0393\n\nIn our case we will take X = O or X = H. Notice (3.1) implies in this case that Fo 6= \u2205\nand that for each a \u2208 \u0393 we have #{b \u2208 \u0393 | a * F \u2229 b * F 6= \u2205} < \u221e. Notice also that (\u0393, F)\nis a frame generator for the action on O if and only if (\u0393, \u03ba\u22121 (F)) is a frame generator for\nthe action of H on H by multiplication.\nLet us now go back to the situation considered in the previous sections. Let (\u0393, F) be\na frame generator, let D \u2282 O be compact subset of O such that F \u2282 D o . Let R \u2282 Rn\nbe a parallelepiped such that D \u2282 R. Choose aj < bj (j = 1, . . . , n) and a basis vj \u2208 Rn\n(j = 1, . . . , n) such that\nn\nX\nxj vj | aj \u2264 xj \u2264 bj } .\nR={\nj=1\n\nLet w1 , . . . , wn be the dual base to v1 , . . . , vn , i.e., (vi | wj ) = \u03b4ij . For m = (m1 , . . . , mn ) \u2208\nZn define w(m) \u2208 Rn by\nX mj\nw(m) :=\nwj .\nbj \u2212 aj\nFinally we define em : Rn \u2192 C by\nn\nX\n1\nem (v) = p\nexp(\n2\u03c0i(v | w(m)))\u03c7R (v)\nVol(R)\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03c7F denotes the indicator function of a set F \u2282 Rn . We identify em with its\nrestriction to R. Then {em }m\u2208Zn is an orthonormal basis for L2 (R). Let\n\u03b1 := sup #{b \u2208 \u0393 | a * D \u2229 b * D 6= \u2205} .\na\u2208\u0393\n\nThen \u03b1 is finite by Lemma 1.6. Let \u03c6 \u2208 L2O (Rn ) be such that:\n(F1) Supp(\u03c6\u0302) \u2282 D;\n(F2) a(\u03c6) := inf \u03c9\u2208F |\u03c6\u0302(\u03c9)| > 0;\n(F3) b(\u03c6) := sup\u03c9\u2208D |\u03c6\u0302(\u03c9)| < \u221e.\nIn particular we could take \u03c6 such that \u03c6\u0302 = \u03c7F .\nTheorem 3.3 (Bernier-Taylor). Assume that (\u0393, F) is a frame generator and that \u03c6 \u2208\nL2O (Rn ) satisfies the conditions (F1), (F2), and (F3). Then, with the above notation, the\nsequence\n{\u03c0((a, w(m))\u22121)\u03c6}(a,m)\u2208\u0393\u00d7Zn\nis a frame for L2O (Rn ) with frame bounds A = Vol(R)a(\u03c6)2 and B = Vol(R)\u03b1b(\u03c6)2 .\n\n\fGROUPS AND FRAMES\n\n9\n\nProof. See [4], Theorem 3.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 3.4. Let H = R+ SO(n) as in Example 1.2. Then H has two orbits, {0} and\nO := Rn \\ {0} in Rn . Notice that L2O (Rn ) = L2 (Rn ) in this case. If u \u2208 O and r 6= 1 then\nru 6= u and, hence, H \u03c9 is a closed subgroup of SO(n) and therefore compact. In fact it\nis easy to see that H \u03c9 is isomorphic to SO(n \u2212 1) for all \u03c9 \u2208 O. Thus all the conditions\n(W1) \u2013 (W4) are fullfilled.\nLet \u03bb > 1 and let \u0393 = {\u03bbn | n \u2208 Z}. Then \u0393 is separated by example 1.2. Choose\n\u03c1 < \u03c3 such that \u03bb\u03c1 \u2264 \u03c3 and define F = {v \u2208 Rn | \u03c1 \u2264 kvk \u2264 \u03c3}. Let v \u2208 O. Then there\nexist an n \u2208 Z such that \u03bbn \u03c1 \u2264 kvk < \u03bbn+1 \u03c1 \u2264 \u03bbn \u03c3. Hence, v \u2208 \u03bb\u2212n F = \u0393 * F. Thus\n(\u0393, F) is a frame generator.\nExample 3.5. In this example we consider a case of a subgroup H \u2282 R+ SO(1, n) acting\non Rn+1 which is more complicated than the example 3.4. But our construction relies on\nthe fact that the action on each of the open orbits is free, i.e., the stabilizer is trivial.\nFor \u03bb \u2208 R\u2217 = {r \u2208 R | r 6= 0}, t \u2208 R, and x \u2208 Rn\u22121 define a(\u03bb, t), n(x) \u2208 GL(n + 1, R)\nby\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ncosh(t) 0\nsinh(t)\nIn\u22121\n0 \uf8f8\na(\u03bb, t) = \u03bb \uf8ed 0\nsinh(t)\n0 cosh(t)\nand\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n2\n1 + 21 kxk2 xT\nkxk\n2\n\uf8f8\nx\nIn\u22121\nx\nn(x) = \uf8ed\n1\n1\n2\nT\n2\n\u2212x 1 \u2212 2 kxk\n\u2212 2 kxk\nand let\nA := {a(\u03bb, t) | \u03bb > 0, t \u2208 R} and N = {n(x) | x \u2208 Rn\u22121 } .\nThen A and N are abelian groups. But calculations are in fact easier using the corresponding Lie algebras, which are abelian and isomorphic to R2 , respectively Rn\u22121 . For\nthat let\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 xT 0\n0\nx\uf8f8 ,\nH(s, t) = sIn+1 + s(E1 n+1 + En+1 1 ) and X(x) = \uf8edx\nT\n0 \u2212x 0\nwhere x \u2208 Rn\u22121 and E\u03bd\u03bc = (\u03b4i\u03bd \u03b4j\u03bc )ij .

Next we notice that a(\u03bb, t)\u03b8 = a(\u03bb, t)\u22121 = a(\u03bb\u22121 , \u2212t), n(x)\u22121 = n(\u2212x),\nand\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 + 12 kxk2 \u2212xT \u2212 12 kxk2\n\uf8f8.\nIn\u22121\nx\nn(x)\u03b8 = n(\u2212x)T = \uf8ed \u2212x\n1\n1\n2\nT\n2\nkxk\n\u2212x 1 \u2212 2 kxk\n2\nHence, the twisted action of a(\u03bb, t) and n(x) is given by\n\na(\u03bb, t) * v = \u03bb\u22121 (cosh(t)v1 \u2212 sinh(t)vn+1 , v2 , . . . , vn , \u2212 sinh(t)v1 + cosh(t)vn+1 )T\nand\n1\n1\nn(x) * v = v + (v1 \u2212 vn+1 )( kxk2 , \u2212xT , kxk2 )T \u2212\n2\n2\n\nn\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\n!\n\nxj vj+1 (1, 0, . . . , 0, 1)T .\n\nn\nIn particular, if we take v = e1 and v = en+1 , where {ej }n+1\nj=1 is the standard basis of R ,\nwe get\n\nn(x)a(\u03bb, t) * e1 = \u03bb\u22121 (cosh(t) +\nand\n\net\net\nkxk2 , \u2212et xT , \u2212 sinh(t) + kxk2 )T\n2\n2\n\net\ne\u2212t\nkxk2 , et xT , cosh(t) \u2212\nkxk2 )T .\n2\n2\nis trivial.

Let a, b \u2208 \u0393 and assume that aB \u2229 bB 6= \u2205. Then\nthere exists a(er , t)n(x), a(es , u)n(y) \u2208 B, such that aa(er , t)n(x) = ba(es , u)n(y). Write\na = a(en1 , m1 )n(m1 ) and b = a(en2 , m2 )n(m2 ) with nj , mj \u2208 Z, and mj \u2208 Zn\u22121 (j = 1, 2).\nThen we have\naa(er , t)n(x) = a(en1 +r , m1 + t)n(er m1 + x)\n= ba(es , u)n(y)\n= a(en2 +s , m2 + u)n(es m2 + y) .\nBut this is only possible if\nn1 + r = n2 + s,\n\nm1 + t = m2 + s\n\nand er m1 + x = es m2 + y .\n\nBut then n1 \u2212n2 = s \u2212r \u2208 Z\u2229[\u22121/2, 1/2] = {0} and, hence, n1 = n2 and s = r.

In particular it follows that \u0393 is separated by B\nin H. Let \u03c91 = e1 , \u03c92 = \u2212e2 , \u03c93 = en+1 and \u03c94 = \u2212en+1 . For j = 1, 2, 3, 4 the map\nH \u220b h 7\u2192 \u03baj (g) := h\u03b8 (\u03c9j ) = h * \u03c9j \u2208 Oj\nis a diffeomorphism such that \u03baj (ab) = a * \u03baj (b). It follows that \u0393 is separated by Bj :=\n\u03baj (B) (j = 1, . . . , 4).\nFor j = 1, . . . , r let\nFj = \u03baj ({a(es , t)n(xT ) | |s| \u2264 1, |t| \u2264 1, |xk | \u2264 1 (k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1)}) .\nThen a simple calculation shows that (\u0393, Fj ) is a frame generator.\n\n\f12\n\nG. \u00d3LAFSSON\n\nExample 3.6. Let H be a locally compact Hausdorff topological group, and assume\nthat there exist a countable discrete subgroup \u0393 \u2282 H such that \u0393\\H is compact. Then\nthere exist a compact subset K \u2282 H such that e \u2208 K o , K \u22121 = {k \u22121 | k \u2208 K} = K\nand K 2 = {ab | a, b \u2208 K} \u2229 \u0393 = {e}. Assume that a, b \u2208 \u0393 and aK \u2229 bK 6= \u2205. Then\nb\u22121 a \u2208 K 2 \u2229 \u0393 = {e} and therefore a = b. It follows that \u0393 is separated by K. As \u0393\\H\nis compact there exist F \u2282 H such that \u0393F = H. Thus (\u0393, F) is a frame generator.\nAssume now that H \u2282 GL(n, R) is closed and that O \u2282 Rn is an open orbit. We\nassume that there exist \u03c9 \u2208 O such that \u0393 \u2229 H \u03c9 = {e}. Let, as usual, \u03ba : H \u2192 O be\nthe canonical map \u03ba(a) = a\u03b8 (\u03c9) = (a\u22121 )T (\u03c9). Then \u0393 is separated by B = \u03ba(K) and\n(\u0393, \u03ba(F)) is a frame generator. We would expect that by modifying the proof of Theorem 3\nin [4] one can remove the condition that \u0393 \u2229 H \u03c9 = {e}, which would give several examples\nof reductive groups acting on Rn . The question is also, if one can remove the condition\nthat H \u03c9 is compact, by \u0393 \u2229 H \u03c9 is finite and one assumes that \u0393\\G/H \u03c9 is compact.\n4. Action of some special groups and frame generators\nThere are natural examples where Rn contains finitely many open orbits satisfying\n(W1) \u2013 (W3) but some of which do not have compact stabilizers. In [8] it was shown\nthat in the case where H is reductive, or more simply stated, H T = H and the stabilizer\nL = H \u03c9 , \u03c9 \u2208 O, is a symmetric subgroup of H, then one can always find a subgroup\nQ = RAN = ANR such that O decomposes \u2013 up to a set of measure zero \u2013 into finitely\nmany open orbits such that (W1) \u2013 (W4) holds. More importantly, the structure of the\ngroup Q is relatively simple and well understood. In particular we have the following:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nThe map A \u00d7 N \u00d7 R \u220b (a, n, r) 7\u2192 anr \u2208 Q is a diffeomorphism;\nR is a compact group and the stabilizer of \u03c9 is contained in R;\nA is abelian and A and R commutes;\nBoth R and A normalize the group N;\nLet\na = {X \u2208 M(n, R) | \u2200t \u2208 R : etX \u2208 A}\n\nbe the Lie algebra of A.

Then exp : n \u2192 N is a diffeomorphism.\nWe refer to [8] for the exact construction, but for completeness we recall some of the\nmain constructions in the next section, but first we will show how those facts can be used\nto construct a separated set and a frame generator. The construction is very much in the\nspirit of Example 3.5. In fact we do not need the last conditions, so from now on we will\nassume that Q = ANR \u2282 GL(n, R) is a closed subgroup satisfying the conditions (1) \u2013\n(5).\n\n\fGROUPS AND FRAMES\n\nLet H1 , . . . , Hr be a basis for a.

Then there exits a compact subset F \u2282 O such that (\u0393, F) is a frame\ngenerator.\nProof. Let F \u2282 H be a compact subset such that such that \u0393F = G.\n\u0003\n5. Action of reductive groups\nIn this section we recall the construction from [8] of the group Q. This in particular\ngives us a simple criteria for the existence of a co-compact discrete subgroup \u0393N in N.\nWe refer to [8] for proofs.\nDefinition 5.1. A closed subgroup H \u2282 GL(n, R) is called reductive if there exist a\nx \u2208 GL(n, R) such that xHx\u22121 is invariant under transposition, a 7\u2192 aT .\nWe assume from now on that H is reductive. For simplicity we can then assume that\nH = H. In order to handle cases where O = H * \u03c9 do not necessarily have compact\nstabilizers, we will assume that there exist an involution \u03c4 : H \u2192 H such that\n\b\nHo\u03c4 \u2282 H \u03c9 = h \u2208 H | hT (\u03c9) = \u03c9 \u2282 H \u03c4\nT\n\nwhere\n\nH \u03c4 = {h \u2208 H | \u03c4 (h) = h}\nand the subscript \"o \" indicates the connected component containing the identity element.\nNotice that the involution \u03c4 may depend on the open orbit. We can assume that L is\nalso invariant\bunder transposition. Then \u03b8 : h 7\u2192 (hT )\u22121 and \u03c4 commute. Let K =\nO(n) \u2229 H = k \u2208 H | k T = k \u22121 . Then K is a maximal compact subgroup of H and\nL \u2229\b\nK is a maximal compact subgroup of L. Denote by h the Lie algebra of H, i.e.,\nh = X \u2208 Mn (R) | \u2200t \u2208 R : etX \u2208 H . Then h decomposes as\nh = k\u2295s\n= l\u2295q\n= k\u2229l\u2295k\u2229q\u2295s\u2229l\u2295s\u2229q\n\nwhere\n\b\ns = X \u2208 h | XT = X\n\nis the subspace of symmetric matrices, and\n\nq = {X \u2208 h | \u03c4 (X) = \u2212X} .\nNotice that\n[l, q] \u2282 q and [k, s] \u2282 s .\n\n\f16\n\nG. \u00d3LAFSSON\n\nEven if we are not going to use it, we would also like to recall the isomorphism q \u2243 T\u03c9 (O)\ngiven in the following way. For X \u2208 q define a derivation DX by\nd\nf (etX * \u03c9)|t=0 .\ndt\nThen q \u220b X 7\u2192 DX \u2208 T\u03c9 (O) is a linear isomorphism. As L fixes \u03c9 it follows that L acts\non T\u03c9 (O). Denote by lh the map lh (\u03b7) = h * \u03b7. Then for h \u2208 L we have\nDX (f ) :=\n\nd\nf (hetX * \u03c9)|t=0\ndt\nd\nf (etAd(h)(X) * \u03c9)|t=0\n=\ndt\n= DAd(h)(X) (f ) .\n\n(dlh )\u03c9 (DX )f =\n\nHence, the action of L corresponds to the natural action of L on q. In particular it follows\nthen that the tangent bundle T (O) can be described as the vector bundle T (O) = H \u00d7L q.\nRecall the linear maps Ad(a), ad(X) : h \u2192 h, a \u2208 H, X \u2208 h, are given by ad(X)Y =\nXY \u2212 Y X = [X, Y ] and Ad(a)Y = aY a\u22121 . Let a be a maximal commutative subspace of\ns \u2229 q; thus XY \u2212 Y X = 0 for all X, Y \u2208 a. Then the algebra ad(a) is also commutative.\nLet (* | *) be the inner product on h given by (X | Y ) := Tr(XY T ). Then a simple\ncalculation shows that (ad(X)Y | Z) = (Y | ad(X T )Z). Thus ad(X)T = ad(X T ). In\nparticular, if X \u2208 s then ad(X) is symmetric. It follows that we can diagonalize the\naction of a on h. Specifically, for \u03b1 \u2208 a\u2217 set\nh\u03b1 = {Y \u2208 h | \u2200X \u2208 a : ad(X)Y = \u03b1(X)Y } .\nLet \u2206 = {\u03b1 \u2208 h\u2217 | h\u03b1 6= {0}} \\ {0}. Notice that the set \u2206 is finite. Hence, there is a\nXr \u2208 a such that \u03b1(Xr ) 6= 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206. Let \u2206+ = {\u03b1 | \u03b1(Xr ) > 0} and Let\nM\nh\u03b1 .\nn=\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\nLet m1 = {X \u2208 h | [a, X] = {0}}, and m = {X \u2208 m1 | \u2200Y \u2208 a : (X | Y ) = 0}. Then m1 =\nm \u2295 a. Furthermore m, n, and p = m \u2295 a \u2295 n are subalgebras of h and\nh = k+p\n= l+p.\nNotice that this is not a direct sum in general because k \u2229 p = k \u2229 m and l \u2229 p = l \u2229 m.\nLet m2 be the algebra generated by m \u2229 s, i.e., m2 = [m \u2229 s, m \u2229 s] \u2295 m \u2229 s.

Choose e = s0 , s1 , . . . , sk \u2208 W such that W is the disjoint union of the\ncosets sj W0 . Then\n[\n \u0307 k\nQsj L \u2282 H\nj=0\n\nis open and dense. Furhermore there exist an analytic function \u03c8 : H \u2192 C such that\nH\\\n\nk\n[\n\nQsj L = {h \u2208 H | \u03c8(h) = 0} .\n\nj=0\n\nIn particular H \\\n\nSk\n\nj=0 Qsj L\n\nhas measure zero.\n\n\f18\n\nG. \u00d3LAFSSON\n\nTheorem 5.3. Let the notation be as above. Let O \u2282 Rn be an open orbit such that\nL = H \u03c9 is a symmetric subgroup. Let Oj = Q * (sj * \u03c9). Then\n[\n \u0307 k\nOj \u2282 O\nj=0\n\nis open and\n\nO\\\n\n[\n \u0307 k\n\nj=0\n\nOj \u2282 O\n\nhas measure zero. Furthermore the stabilizer in Q of \u03c9\u0303 in Oj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 k) is compact.\nExample 5.4 (GL(n, R) acting on symmetric matrices). Let V be the space Sym(n.R) of\nsymmetric n\u00d7n matrices. Then V \u2243 Rn(n+1)/2 Under this identification the standard inner\nproduct on Rn(n+1)/2 corresponds to the inner product (X, Y ) := Tr(XY ) = Tr(XY T ) on\nV . Define an action of H = GL(n, R) on V by\na(X) = (a\u22121 )T Xa\u22121 .\nThen\na * X = a\u03b8 (X) = aXaT .\nEach symmetric matrix is up to conjugation determined by the signature and rank. The\nset Vreg = {X \u2208 V | det X 6= 0} is open and dense in V and has measure zero. Furthermore\neach matrix in Vreg is conjugate to one of the matrices I(0) = In , I(n) = \u2212In or\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIn\u2212p\n0\nI(p) =\n0 In\u2212p\n\nwhere 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n \u2212 1. Denote the corresponding orbit by Op . Notice that X 7\u2192 \u2212X\ndefines a GL(n, R) isomorphism Op \u2243 On\u2212p . The group O(p, n \u2212 p) is by definition given\nby\nO(p, n \u2212 p) = {g \u2208 GL(n, R) | gI(p)g T = I(p)}\nwhere we use the notation O(n) = O(n, 0) = O(0, n). Notice that SO(p, n \u2212 p) is compact\nif and only if p = n. It follows that only the orbits O0 and On satisfy the condition\n(W4). As before we let \u03b8 : GL(n, R) \u2192 GL(n, R) be the involution \u03b8(g) = (g \u22121)T . For\nj = 0, . . . , n we define \u03c4p : GL(n, R) \u2192 GL(n, R) by\n(5.2)\n\n\u03c4p (g) = I(p)\u03b8(g)I(p) .\n\nThen\n\u03c4p (g) = g \u21d0\u21d2 gI(p)g T = I(p)\nand, hence,\nH \u03c4p = {g \u2208 GL(n, R) | \u03c4p (g) = g} = O(p, n \u2212 p) = H I(p)\nand hence the orbit Op \u2243 GL(n, R)/O(p, n \u2212 p) is a symmetric space.\nBy abuse of notation we denote the derived involutions on M(n, R) by the same letters,\ni.e.,\n\u03b8(X) = \u2212X T ,\n\u03c4p (X) = \u2212I(p)X T I(p) .\n\n\fGROUPS AND FRAMES\n\n19\n\nThen \u03b8(exp X) = exp(\u03b8(X)) and \u03c4p (exp X) = exp(\u03c4p (X)). Define as in the last section:\nk\ns\nh\nq\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n{X\n{X\n{X\n{X\n\n\u2208 M(n, R) | \u03b8(X) = X} = o(n) ,\n\u2208 M(n, R) | \u03b8(X) = \u2212X} = Sym(n, R) ,\n\u2208 M(n, R) | \u03c4p (X) = X} = o(p, n \u2212 p) ,\n\u2208 M(n, R) | \u03c4p (X) = \u2212X} ,\n\nwhere we leave out the dependence of h and q on p as that should be clear in each case.\nThen\ngl(n, R) = k \u2295 s\n= h\u2295q\n= k\u2229 h\u2295k\u2229 q\u2295s \u2229h\u2295 s\u2229 q.\nIn this case the abelian subalgebra a is given by:\na = {d(t1 , . . . , tn ) | t1 , . . . , tn \u2208 R}\nwhere d(d1 , . . . , tn ) = d(t) stands for the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries t1 , . . . , tn .\nIn this case a is maximal abelian in s and in fact maximal abelian in h. Hence, the\ncentralizer of a in k and l is trivial. Thus we will have P = Q in this case.\nA simple calculation shows that\n[d(t), Eij ] = (ti \u2212 tj )Eij ,\ni.e., the matrices Eij are the joint eigenvectors of {ad(d(t)) | d(t) \u2208 a}, with eigenvalues\nti \u2212 tj . Define \u03b1ij : a \u2192 R by \u03b1ij (d(t)) = ti \u2212 tj . Then \u2206 = {\u03b1ij | 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i 6= 0}.\nLet \u2206+ = {\u03b1ij | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n}. Then n is the Lie algebra of upper triangular matrices\nwith zero on the main diagonal:\nM\nn=\nREij .\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\nFurthermore A = exp(a) = {d(et1 , . . . , etn ) = {d(t) | tj > 0} and N = exp(n) is the group\nof upper triangular matrices with one on the main diagonal. So in particular AN is the\ngroup of upper triangular matrices with positive diagonal elements. In this case the group\nM is given by M = {d(\u01eb) | \u01ebj = \u00b1} \u2243 {\u22121, 1}n and P = MAN is the group of regular\nupper triangular matrices. The group NK (A) is the finite group of elements with only\none coefficient non-zero in each column and row, and that non-zero element is either 1 or\n\u22121. Let Sn be the group of permutations of {1, . . . , n}. Then W acts on a by\n\u03c3 * d(t1 , . . . , tn ) = d(t\u03c3\u22121 (1) , . . . , t\u03c3\u22121 (n) ) .\nNotice that this action can be realized as the conjugation by the orthogonal matrix\nsij = (In \u2212 Eii \u2212 Ejj ) + Eij \u2212 Eji \u2208 M \u2032 .\nIt follows that W \u2243 Sn . The group L \u2229 K = O(p, n \u2212 p) \u2229 O(n) is given by\nL \u2229 K \u2243 O(p) \u00d7 O(n \u2212 p)\n\n\f20\n\nG. \u00d3LAFSSON\n\nwhere the isomorphism is given by\n(a, b) 7\u2192\n\n\u0012\n\na 0\n0 b\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nHence, W0 \u2243 Sp \u00d7 Sn\u2212p . In particular each of the open GL(n, R)-orbits is decomposed\nn!\nP -orbits. Finally we remark that in this example we can take\ninto p!(n\u2212p)!\n\u0393N = N \u2229 GL(n, Z)\nthe group of upper triangular matrices with integer coefficients and one on the diagonal.\nRemark 5.5. Examples of pairs (H, Rn ) such that H is reductive and has finitely many\nopen oribts of full measure is given by the pre-homogeneous vector spaces of parabolic type\n(see [5]). But there are simple examples where the stabilizer is not symmetric. For that\nlet H = SL(2, R). Then H acts on R2 in a natural way and the orbits are {0} and R2 \\{0}.\nHence there is only one open orbit, and that orbit has full measure. The stabilizer of e1\nis the group\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n1 x\nN=\n|x\u2208R\n0 1\nwhich is not symmetric in SL(2, R). Let\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\na 0\nQ=\n| a 6= 0 y \u2208 R\ny 1/a\nThen Q has three orbits {0}, {(0, y)T \u2208 R2 | y 6= 0} and the open oribt O = {(x, y)T \u2208\nR2 | x 6= 0}. The stabilizer of e1 \u2208 O is trivial and, hence, we can replace SL(2, R) by Q\nto construct frames. Notice that Q is isomorphic to the (ax + b)-group.\nRemark 5.6. Assume that (H, Rn ) is a pre-homogeneous vector space of parabolic type.\nThen one can show that the same group Q works for all the open oribts [5]. Furthermore\nthe group Q is admissible in the sense of Laugesen, Weaver, Weiss, and Wilson [19] and\ncontains an expansive matrix.\nReferences\n[1] S.T. Al, J.-P. Antoine, and J.-P.
