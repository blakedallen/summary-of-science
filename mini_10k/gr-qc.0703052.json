A main obstacle to its consistent quantization lies in the observation\nthat the theory of Einstein's gravity, unlike the standard model and quantum\nchromodynamics, is perturbatively nonrenormalizable in metric variables.\nThis impasse has led to two main alternative approaches to its quantization,\nnamely string theory and loop quantum gravity. String theory is based\nupon the idea that Einstein's theory of gravity is the low energy limit of\na more fundamental theory which should rather be quantized instead, and\nleads to 26 (or 10, in the case of the superstring) dimensional spacetime.\nLoop quantum gravity attempts to nonperturbatively quantize gravity in\n4-dimensional spacetime in the loop representation and has led to many\ninsights at the kinematic level of the gravitational phase space.\nOne of the ingredients needed for a finite theory of quantum gravity, by\nthe interpretation we adopt in this and in subsequent works, is that given a\nmodel coupled to Einstein's relativity in 4-dimensions, one may be able to\nexplicitly construct the physical quantum states devoid of ultraviolet infinities for the full theory as well as for minisuperspace. A physical quantum\nstate is defined, by this criterion, as a wavefunctional satisfying the quantum\nversion of the constraints of Einstein's general relativity in Ashtekar variables. To explicitly construct such states one may quantize the theory in\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger representation utilizing Dirac's method for quantizing constrained systems [1]. A good review of the background behind the Ashtekar\nvariables and their resulting simplifications of general relativity can be found\nin [2], [3],[4],[5],[6].\nThere is one special state in the full theory of quantum gravity, known\nas the Kodama state, known to exactly solve the quantum constraints to all\norders for a particular operator ordering [7]. The fact that this state as well\nsolves the classical constraints exactly [8], leads to a new conjecture: the\nprinciple of the Semiclassical-Quantum correspondence (SQC). For the pure\nKodama state, the SQC amounts to the imposition of a self-duality condition\nconstraining the Ashtekar electric and magnetic fields to be proportional to\neach other by a factor of the cosmological constant \u039b.\nThe expansion of the Hamiltonian constraint reveals its division into a\nsemiclassical part and singular quantum terms. In the case of pure gravity\nwith \u039b term, the quantum terms cancel out and the semiclassical part leads\ndirectly, via the SQC, to the pure Kodama state. When matter fields are\npresent in addition to gravity, the SQC is broken due to the existence of\ninduced singlar quantum terms. These singular quantum terms constitute\nan obstacle to the construction of a finite state of quantum gravity. Once\n1\n\n\fthese singularities are dealt with, then the resulting state once constructed\nshould be finite. One can then focus on other issues such as normalizability,\nexpectation values, probability currents and reality conditions. We save\ntreatment of these aspects for future work.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we outline the relevant attributes of the pure Kodama state and introduce the concept of the\nsemiclassical-quantum correspondence, with a view to generalizing these attributes. In section 3 we generalize the Kodama state by introducing some\ndegrees of freedom (via a CDJ matrix) necessary to incorporate the presence of matter fields quantized with gravity on the same footing. In section\n4 we revisit the kinematic constraints within the context of matter coupling\nand quantize the constraints subject to the CDJ Ansatz, showing that the\nSQC remains unbroken. In section 5 we quantize the Hamiltonian constraint\ncoupled to matter, subject to the CDJ Ansatz. By requiring that the SQC\nremain unbroken in spite of the composite nature of the quantum operators\ninvolved, we delineate the criteria for finiteness of the generalized Kodama\nstate via a system of nine equations in nine unknowns, shown in section 6.1\nIn section 7 we then delineate the construction of the generalized Kodama\nstate for the full theory from the CDJ matrix elements, explicitly showing\nits restriction to the final spatial hypersurface \u03a3T and independence of any\nfield velocities or evolution within the interior of the spacetime manifold\nM = \u03a3 \u00d7 R. We show the equivalence of the generalized Kodama states\n\u03a8GKod with respect to a variety of representations, including a direct generalization of toplogical field theory to accomodate the presence of the matter\nfields as well as a via techniques of geometric quantization applied to the\ncohomology of field theory.2 It is hoped that this work should consitute a\nfirst step in the construction of a finite theory in that we provide a prescription for eliminating untraviolet infinities usually present in the canonical\napproach to a quantum theory containing composite momentum operators\nby way of the SQC. Also, we demonstrate the equivalence of at least three\nquantization procedures namely: Reduced phase space, Dirac and geometric\nquantization for the generalized Kodama states.\nWe must make a few notes on conventions. First, our use of the term\n'generalized Kodama states' is not to be confused with the use in [9] and\n[10], where Andrew Randono constructs Kodama states for pure gravity\nusing different values of the Immirzi parameter \u03b3 to label states. The use\nof the term in this publication will signify the generalization from pure\ngravity to the analogous state when additional fields besides gravity are\n1\n\nThe general solution for the CDJ matrix elements in the full theory is beyond the scope\nof this paper. The interested reader is directed to [11], where our method of solution is\ndeveloped in some detail.\n2\nWe relegate the demonstration of the equivalence of the aforementioned representations to the path integral representation to [12], in which we formulate an analogue to the\nHartle Hawking noboundary proposal [13],[14] in Ashtekar variables.\n\n2\n\n\f\u221a\npresent for \u03b3 = \u22121. Secondly, a quick note on the Ashtekar variables:\nThe basic dynamical variables are a left-handed SU (2)\u2212 connection, Aai and\nits conjugate momentum, a densitized triad \u03c3\neai living in a 4-dimensional\nspacetime manifold M = \u03a3 \u00d7 R. Our convention for index labeling is that\nletters from the beginning of the Latin alphabet a, b, c, ... signify internal\nSU (2)\u2212 indices and that letters from the middle of the alphabet i, j, k, ...\nsignify spatial indices. Spacetime position in M will be written as x, however\nwe will on ocassion highlight the significance of spatial position in \u03a3 by use\nof the boldface x, where x = (x, t).\n\n2\n\nThe pure Kodama state in perspective\n\nThe Einstein-Hilbert action in Ashtekar variables can be written in terms\nof its 3+1 ADM-type decomposition ([2],[3],[4])\nZ\nZ\ni i a\nea \u0226i \u2212 iN Hgrav \u2212 N i (Hi )grav \u2212 \u03b8 a Ga ),\n(1)\nI = dt d3 x( \u03c3\nG\n\u03a3\n\nwhich is a canonical one-form minus a linear combination of first-class constraints. The constraints are given by the classical equations of motion for\nthe corresponding Lagrange multipliers, which are nondynamical fields since\ntheir time derivatives\ndo not appear in the action. These are the lapse denp\nsity N = N/ dethij (where hij is the 3-metric), the shift vector N i , and the\ntime component of the self-dual Ashtekar connection Aa0 = \u03b8 a . The classical\nconstraints read\n\nGa (x) =\n\n\u03b4I\n= Di \u03c3\neai (x) = \u2202i \u03c3\neai + fabc Abi \u03c3\neci = 0 \u2200x \u2208 M,\n\u03b4\u03b8 a (x)\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is the SU (2)\u2212 Gauss' law constraint with structure constants fabc .\nThen there is the diffeomorphism constraint\n(Hi )grav (x) =\n\n\u03b4I\n= \u01ebijk \u03c3\neaj (x)Bak (x) = 0 \u2200x \u2208 M,\n\u03b4N i (x)\n\n(3)\n\nand the Hamiltonian constraint\n\nHgrav =\n\n1\n\u03b4I\n= \u01ebabc \u01ebijk \u03c3\neai \u03c3\nebj Bck + \u01ebabc \u01ebijk \u03c3\neai \u03c3\nebj \u03c3\neck \u039b = 0 \u2200x \u2208 M.\n\u03b4N (x)\n6\n\n(4)\n\nThese constraints must hold, classically, at all points x = (x, t) in the\n4-dimensional manifold M . Here, x is the spatial position on a spatial\nhypersurface \u03a3t labelled by time t. We are interested in the reduced phase\n\n3\n\n\fspace for this system, which corresponds to the physical degrees of freedom.\nThe Hamiltonian constraint admits a nontrivial classical solution,\ni\n6\neck = \u2212 Bck \u2200k, c\n\u03c3\neck + Bck = 0 \u2212\u2192 \u03c3\n(5)\n6\n\u039b\nwhich is the self-duality relation between the Ashtekar electric and magnetic\nfields, somewhat analogous to the self-duality relation for the electromagnetic field propagating in a vacuum in which \u039b\u22121 plays the role of c, the\nconstant and finite speed of light.

To transform the relations (15) into the Schr\u00f6dinger representation one chooses the\nbasis vectors Aai of the quantum states to be eigenstates of the quantum\noperator \u00c2ai (x) for a given point x.

The 'weighting' functional w[A] can be chosen\njudiciously. A good example for judicious choices of weighting functions\nin quantum theories was given by Ashtekar and Rovelli in [17] in Maxwell\ntheory, in which the weighting function for the Bargmann representation\nwas chosen as a measure for the normalization such that certain operators\nbecome Hermitian. We will for the time being leave the weighting function\nw[A] unspecified, but reserve the freedom to choose it appropriately when\nthe opportunity presents itself.\nThe property of infinite dimensional spaces, which is indigenous to all\nquantum field theories including quantum gravity, is a direct consequence\nof consideration of the full theory as opposed to minisuperspace. Any state\n\u03a8 can be expressed in this basis by projecting it onto the complete set of\nstates (17) defined on a particular spatial hypersurface \u03a3t corresponding to\ntime t, as presented by Misner in [18]\n\u03a8(t) =\n\nZ\n\nD\u03bc[A(t)] A(t) A(t) \u03a8\n\n(18)\n\nwith A \u03a8 = \u03a8[A].

The condition is defined on a\nparticular 3-surface \u03a3t on which the constraint is evaluated. Let us contract\nthe left-hand side of (26) by the time derivative \u0226ai (x) and integrate over all\n3-space of the manifold \u03a3.\nZ\n\n\u03b4I\ndI\nd x a\n= \u22126(G\u039b~)\u22121\n\u0226ai (x, t) =\n\u03b4A\ndt\n(x,\nt)\n\u03a3\ni\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd3 xBai (x, t)\u0226ai (x, t) (27)\n\nwhich is nothing but the definition of the time derivative of a functional of\nan independent variable Aai defined on 3-space in terms of the evolution of\nthe variable.

Integrating from\nt = t0 to t = T , one has that the functional I evolves from the initial\n3-surface \u03a30 to the final 3-surface \u03a3T\n4\n\nThis latter condition, which differs from conventional functional calculus, is based on\nthe requirement that spatial and functional differentiation must commute [25].\n\n8\n\n\fI(T ) \u2212 I(t0 ) =\n\nZ\n\nT\n\ndt\n\nt0\n\ndI\n=\ndt\n\nZ\n\nM\n\ntrF \u2227 F = ICS [A(\u03a3T )] \u2212 ICS [(\u03a30 )],\n\n(29)\n\nwhere we have used the results from (11). One can obtain the same result\nby applying (26) as evaluated on the final spatial hypersurface \u03a3T to (28),\nunsupressing the time label to yield\nZ\nd3 xBai (x, T )\u03b4Aai (x, T ) = \u03b4ICS [A(T )]\n(30)\n\u03b4IT =\n\u03a3\n\nand consequently IT = ICS [A(T )]. One can now write down the solution to\nthe quantum Hamiltonian constraint as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03a8Kod [A] = exp \u22126(G\u039b~)\u22121 ICS [A] .\n\n(31)\n\nwere in (31) we have suppressed the label T of the spatial hypersurface\n\u03a3T forming the boundary \u2202M . So the quantum state (31) and the semiclassically determined states (14) coincide to all orders with no quantum\ncorrections. We will define this property, the 'Semiclassical-Quantum Correspondence' (SQC). The usual prescription by which a classical theory gets\npromoted to its quantum counterpart is a rough rule of thumb which leads\nto an ambiguity in quantum theories to choose from of order ~. The correct\nquantum theory is fixed by comparison with experiment. However, we have\ndemonstrated that from the infinite set of possibilities to choose from there\nis a unique quantum state which coincides with the classical state exactly\nto all orders, namely the Kodama state.5\nA reasonable question to ask is what physical theories admit a pure\nKodama state. It has been demonstrated [19],[3],[20] the construction of\nsuch states by alternate methods for N = 1 and N = 2 supergravities\nin 4-dimensions. In [21] a canonical analysis was performed for N = 3\nsupergravity. The reason that no such Kodama state seems to have been\nconstructed, to the present author's knowledge, is due to the fact that for\nN \u2265 3 there automatically exist additional lower spin fields which ruin\nthe topological nature of the models that exhibit the SQC. We hope to\nultimately demonstrate, in this series of publications, a new way to extend\nthe SQC to such models.\n\n5\nWe rename this the 'pure' Kodama state since it exists for pure gravity with \u039b term,\ndevoid of any matter fields.\n\n9\n\n\f2.2\n\nSemiclassical-quantum correspondence for the pure Kodama state\n\nThe pure Kodama state is the exact solution to the constraints of the full\ntheory with \u039b term when there are no matter fields present in addition to\ngravity, given by \u03a8Kod = \u03a8Kod [A]. This can be represented in terms of the\nself-duality Ansatz\n\u03c3\neai = \u22126\u039b\u22121 \u03b4ae Bei .\n\n(32)\n\nThe pure Kodama state arguably, issues of normalizability aside, can be said\nto represent a canonical quantization of four dimensional general relativity in\nthe full superspace theory, exactly to all orders with no quantum corrections\nfor pure gravity with \u039b term. Of course \u03a8Kod is a special state, which\nsatisfies the self-duality condition and as well the semiclassical-quantum\ncorrespondence (SQC). Equation (32) satisfies the SQC since its quantized\ncounterpart yields the same condition to all orders. The quantized version\nof (32) is given by\n~G\n\n3\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a8Kod [A]\n\u03b4Aai (x)\n\n6\n= \u2212 Bai (x)\u03a8Kod [A].\n\u039b\n\n(33)\n\nGeneralized Kodama state and the CDJ Ansatz\n\nWe have reviewed the method for the quantization of gravity for pure gravity\nwith cosmological term \u039b as it relates to the pure Kodama state \u03a8Kod . We\nnow outline a method to extend this to the more general case for a nondegenerate magnetic field Bai , namely gravity coupled to quantized matter fields.\nThere are a few complications relative to the pure Kodama state which will\narise due to the presence of quantized matter fields in the full theory. The\ngeneralized Kodama state contains functional dependence upon the gravitational Aai and matter variables \u03a8GKod = \u03a8GKod [A, \u03c6], where \u03c6 = \u03c6(x)\nrepresents the matter fields of the model. First let us write the starting\naction for gravity coupled to matter, the analogue of (1), for completeness.\nZ\n\nZ\n\nh i\n\u0001i\n\u0001\neai \u0226ai +\u03c0 \u03c6\u0307\u2212iN (Hgrav +G\u03a9)\u2212N i (Hi )grav +GHi \u2212\u03b8 a Ga +GQa ,\nd3 x ( \u03c3\nG\n\u03a3\n(34)\nwhere \u03a9 is the matter contribution to the Hamiltonian constraint, Hi the\nmatter contribution to the diffeomorphism constraint, Qa the matter contribution to the Gauss' law constraint, and \u03c0 = \u03c0(x) the conjugate momentum\nto the matter field \u03c6(x). One can then go through the analogous manipulations with respect to (34) as in section 2.\nI=\n\ndt\n\n10\n\n\fIt has been shown by Thiemann in [22] that when matter fields are\npresent in addition to gravity, the constraints can still be solved at the\nclassical level by use of the CDJ Ansatz\n\u03c3\neai (x) = \u03a8ae (x)Bei (x).\n\n(35)\n\nIn (35) the CDJ matrix \u03a8ae \u2261 \u03a8ae [A, \u03c6] in general contains nontrivial functional dependence upon the gravitational and the matter variables at each\npoint x. The CDJ Ansatz (35) can be viewed as a generalization of the selfduality condition (32) to accomodate the presence of the matter fields, and\ncontains sufficient degrees of freedom to allow solution of the constraints at\nthe classical level [22]. Our claim in this paper is that since the CDJ Ansatz\nis linear in gravitational momentum \u03c3\neai , it as well satisfies the SQC. Therefore one should be able to promote (35) to its quantized version without\nbreaking this correspondence.

This can\nalso be argued from the standpoint that the standard matter Lagrangians\nrequire an inverse metric g\u03bc\u03bd [23].\n\n7\n\nNot all states are 'momentum eigenstates' satisfying equation (41).\nWe demonstrate in [12] how W [A, \u03c6] can be chosen such as to establish formal equivalence of the path-integral representation of \u03a8GKod to its canonically determined version.\n8\n\n12\n\n\f3.1\n\nMixed partials condition\n\nSince the gravitational and matter fields Aai (x) and \u03c6(x) respectively are\nindependent dynamical variables, then they must have trivial commutation\nrelations with each other.

In\norder for (47) to be valid, the coefficient of \u03b4(3) (0) must vanish as well.9\nThis implies\n\u2202\u03c0\n\u2202\u03a8ae\ni\n\u2200x.\n= \u2212 Bei\na\n\u2202Ai\nG\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(48)\n\nNote that (48) is a condition which holds separately at each point x on\nthe hypersurface \u03a3t for each time t. The mixed partials condition will be\nuseful in the elimination of matter momentum in the construction of the\ngeneralized Kodama states, and is a key input for the definition of \u03a8GKod .\nThe general solution of (48) can be written, by integration over the\nfunctional space of Ashtekar connections A \u2208 \u0393 at fixed position x, for the\nspecified spatial hypersurface \u03a3t , as10\ni \u2202 \u0010\n\u03c0 = \u03c0[A, \u03c6] = f (\u03c6) \u2212\nG \u2202\u03c6\n9\n\nZ\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0011\n\u03b4X ae \u03a8ae [A, \u03c6],\n\n(49)\n\nAlso, it is assumed that\nR \u03a8GKod is an eigenstate of the momentum operator.\nThe brackets around \u03b4X ae are meant to signify that the integration constitutes a\nlinear operator, which must be separated from the vector space \u03a8ae which it acts on.\n10\n\n13\n\n\fwhere f (\u03c6) is an arbitrary function of the matter field \u03c6(x) acting as a\n'constant' of functional integration with respect to the gravitational configuration variables Aai (x) for each spatial point x, and where the 'functional'\none-form \u03b4X ae is given by\n\u03b4X ae (x) = Bei (x)\u03b4Aai (x).\n\n(50)\n\nThere are four things to note concerning (49). First, it is a linear relation\nbetween the matter momentum \u03c0(x) and the CDJ matrix \u03a8ae (x) arising\nas a consistency condition of the quantization procedure. Secondly, it has\nthe same functional form for each position x in \u03a3, and therefore resembles a minisuperspace equation but is in actuality the full theory. Third,\none can consider the allowable semiclassical matter momenta to be labeled\nby the arbitrary function f . Fourth, even though f is freely specifiable,\nit can be judiciously chosen for instance such as to produce a 'boundary\ncondition' on the generalized Kodama state such that the proper wavefunction is obtained in the limit when there is no gravity. The function f then\ncan serve to reproduce the wavefunction which would result from solving\nthe functional Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the Klein\u2013Gordon Hamiltonian in\nMinkowski spacetime.11\n\n4\n\n4.1\n\nQuantization of the generalized kinematic constraints\nDiffeomorphism constraint\n\nThe classical diffeomorphism constraint in the presence of matter reads\n\u01ebijk \u03c3\neaj Bak = GHi = G\u03c0\u2202i \u03c6,\n\n(51)\n\n\u01ebijk (\u03a8ae Bej )Bak = GHi .\n\n(52)\n\nwhere Hi is the matter contribution. In (51) we have introduced a factor\nof G to balance the dimensions in accordance with the time-space part of\nthe Einstein equations G0i = GT0i . Substution of the CDJ Ansatz (35) into\n(51) yields the condition\n\nUsing the relation \u01ebijk Bej Bak = (detB)(B \u22121 )di \u01ebdae and assuming the nondegeneracy of the Ashtekar magnetic field Bai , we have\n11\nOr any appropriate semiclassical limit even which corresponds to observable effects\nbelow the Planck scale, if desired.\n\n14\n\n\fBdi Hi\n= Ge\n\u03c40d ,\n(53)\ndetB\nwhere \u03c4e0d is the projection of the time-space component of the matter energy\nmomentum tensor T0i into SU (2)\u2212 . The tilde signifies that it is rescaled,\nor densitized, by a factor of det\u22121 B, signifying again the nondegeneracy requirement alluded to earlier. Equation (53) is a statement that the antisymmetric part of the CDJ matrix is uniquely fixed by the matter contribution\nto the quantum diffeomorphism constraint, as noted in [22].\nThere are two main points of interest regarding (53): First, the constraint\nis locally satisfied as a linear relation. The antisymmetric components of\n\u03a8ab here and now depend upon the local matter momentum here and now.\nSecondly, a nontrivial right hand side to (52) signifies one of the differences\nbetween the full superspace and minisuperspace theories since it contains\nspatial gradients of the matter fields which would otherwise be zero due to\nspatial homogeneity. In the minisuperspace theory one would have Hi = 0\nfor a Klein\u2013Gordon scalar field, corresponding to a symmetric CDJ matrix.\nThe quantized diffeomorphism constraint reads, taking Hi as the matter\ncontribution, as\n\u01ebdae \u03a8ae = G\n\n\u0010\nkj\n= ~G\u03b4(3) (0)\u01ebijk Dbb\n\n\u0001\nj\n\u01ebijk \u03c3\n\u00eaa (x)Bak (x) + G\u03c0(x)\u2202i \u03c6(x) \u03a8GKod =\ni\nh\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u2202i \u03c6(x) \u03a8GKod\nBbk (x) \u2212 iG~\n~G\u01ebijk b\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\n\u03b4Aj (x)\n\u0011\n\u2212 iG~(\u2202i \u03b4(3) (0)) + \u01ebijk \u03a8be Bej Bbk + G\u03c0\u2202i \u03c6 \u03a8GKod\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= \u01ebijk \u03a8be Bej Bbk + G\u03c0\u2202i \u03c6 \u03a8GKod = 0.(54)\n\nIn (54) we have used the quantized CDJ Ansatz as well as the definition\nij\nDab\n= \u03b4Bai /\u03b4Abj . The quantum terms in (54) vanish due to antisymmeij\ntry of Dab\nand the assumption that functional differentiation and spatial\ndifferentiation commute as in (23).12 The requirement that the quantized\ndiffeomorphism constraint be satisfied leads to the condition\n\u01ebijk \u03a8be Bej Bbk + G\u03c0\u2202i \u03c6 = 0.\n\n(55)\n\nEquation (55) is precisely the same condition that would arise from the classical part of the constraint, and therefore satisfies a semiclassical-quantum\ncorrespondence. In fact, this result holds independently of the chosen operator ordering. It is a property of constraints which are linear in conjugate\nmomenta that the operator ordering for the quantized version is immaterial\n[15],[24].\n12\n\nThis assumption differs from conventional calculus. A brief development of some basic\ntechniques for dealing with field theoretical singularities can be found in [25].\n\n15\n\n\f4.2\n\nGauss' law constraint\n\nThe classical Gauss' law constraint in the presence of the matter fields reads\nDi \u03c3\neai (x) = GQa (x).\n\n(56)\n\nDi (\u03a8ae Bei ) = \u03a8ae Di Bei + Bei Di \u03a8ae = GQa .\n\n(57)\n\nAgain, note that the matter contribution Qa contains a factor of G relative\nto the gravitational contribution in (56) in order to balance the dimensions.\nImplicit in (56) is a dimensionless constant \u03bb, which represents the numerical\nvalue of the matter SU (2)\u2212 charge, in the definition of Qa . This would be\nthe analogue of the electric charge e in Maxwell theory and is expected to be\nvery small. Substitution of the CDJ Ansatz into (56) leads to the condition\n\nUsing the Bianchi identity this yields\nBei Di \u03a8ae = GQa .\n\n(58)\n\nThe quantum Gauss' law constraint reads\nh \u0010\n\u011ca \u03a8GKod = Di ~G\n\ni\n\u03b4 \u0011\n+\nGQ\n(x)\n\u03a8GKod = 0.\na\n\u03b4Aai (x)\n\n(59)\n\nwhere Qa is the SU (2)\u2212 charge for a general matter field, given by\nQa (x) = \u03bb\u03c0\u03b1 (x)(Ta )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c6\u03b2 (x).\n\n(60)\n\nIncorporating the matter contribution and applying the CDJ Ansatz, the\nmatter constraint reads\nh\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b2 (x)\n\u03b4 i\nDi (\u03a8ae (x)Bei (x)) \u2212 i~\u03bbG \u03b1\n\u03a8GKod\n(Ta )\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 i~\u03bbG\u03c6\u03b2 (Ta )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u03b4\u03c6 (x)\n\u03b4\u03c6 (x)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= Di (\u03a8ae Bei ) \u2212 i~\u03bbG\u03b4(3) (0)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 (Ta )\u03b1\u03b2 + G\u03bb\u03c0\u03b1 (x)(Ta )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c6\u03b2 (x) \u03a8GKod\n\u0011\n\u0010\n= Di (\u03a8ae Bei ) + GQa \u03a8GKod (61)\n\nwhere we have used in the last line of (61) that the SU (2)\u2212 charge generators\n(Ta )\u03b1\u03b2 are traceless in order to get rid of the singular \u03b4(3) (0) term in the\nsecond line of (61). So we see from (61) that the quantum condition precisely\nimplies the semiclassical condition. The Gauss' law constraint satisfies the\nSQC due to being linear in conjugate momenta.\nFor a Klein-Gordon scalar field \u03c6 the source term Qa is zero since the\nfield is a Lorentz scalar and therefore does not transform under SU (2). The\nGauss' law constraint for the general case of matter coupled to gravity is\ngiven, by the coefficient of \u03a8GKod in the last line of (61), by\n16\n\n\fDi (\u03a8ae Bei ) + GQa = 0\n\n(62)\n\nLet us focus first on the first term on the left hand side of (62). This reads\nDi (\u03a8ae Bei ) = (Di Bei )\u03a8ae + Bei Di \u03a8ae = Bei Di \u03a8ae ,\n\n(63)\n\nwhere we have used the Bianchi identity. The last term of (63) forms the\ncovariant derivative of a SU (2)\u2212 \u2297 SU (2)\u2212 -valued tensor \u03a8ae . Expanding\nthis, applying the tensor representation of the covariant derivative, we have\n\u0001\nBei Di \u03a8ae = Bei \u2202i \u03a8ae + faf g Afi \u03a8ge + fef g Afi \u03a8ag\n\u0001\n= Bei \u2202i \u03a8ae + Bei Afi faf g \u03a8ge + fef g \u03a8ag .\n\n(64)\n\nNote that for the case of a homogeneous and isotropic CDJ matrix \u03a8ab =\n6\u039b\u22121 \u03b4ab (e.g. the pure Kodama state), (64) would be zero. Hence factoring\nout \u039b which is a numerical constant, we would have\nBei \u2202i \u03a8ae + Bei Afi faf g \u03a8ge + fef g \u03a8ag\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n= Bei \u2202i \u03b4ae + Bei Afi faf g \u03b4ge + fef g \u03b4ag\n\u0001\n= 0 + Bei Afi faf e + fef a = 0\n\n(65)\n\ndue to antisymmetry of the structure constants.13\n\n4.3\n\nRecapitulation of the kinematic constraints\n\nThere are a few items of note regarding the kinematic constraints.\n(i) Both sets of constraints are linear in conjugate momenta and their solution depends linearly upon the matter source, namely the Noether charges\ncorresponding to the respective kinematic symmetries. The kinematic constraints by definition satisfy the SQC since the operator ordering for the\nquantized version is immaterial.\n(ii) As a corollary to (i), the processes of Dirac quantization and phase space\nreduction are the same for the kinematic constraints [15].\n(iii) The solutions to the six kinematic constraints eliminate, modulo boundary conditions on the Gauss' law constraints, six out of nine degrees of freedom of the CDJ matrix \u03a8ab , leaving three degrees of freedom remaining for\nthe Hamiltonian constraint.\n13\n\nWe provide an explicit general solution to the Gauss' law constraint, in the full theory\ncoupled to matter fields, in [26].\n\n17\n\n\f(iv) The diffeomorphism constraint determines the antisymmetric part of the\nCDJ matrix and depends locally upon the spatial gradients of the matter\nfield, which distinguishes one aspect of the full theory from minisuperspace.\nThe Gauss' law constraint in general should determine three alternate CDJ\nmatrix elements, reducing the CDJ matrix \u03a8ae by an additional three degrees of freedom. The matter contribution to this constraint is of exactly the\nsame form in the minisuperspace and in the full theory, but does distinguish\nSU (2)\u2212 scalars from fields transforming nontrivially under SU (2)\u2212 . The\ndiffeomorphism constraint makes this distinction as well, via the difference\nbetween a spatial gradient \u2202i and a SU (2)\u2212 covariant derivative Di = \u2202i +Ai .\n(v) Lastly, the quantized versions of the kinematic constraints do not produce any information not already contained in their classical counterparts\ndue to the SQC. The form of these constraints is model-independent, since\nthey are expressed entirely as a representation of the kinematic gauge algebra, namely a semidirect product of SU (2)\u2212 gauge transformations with\ndiffeomorphisms.14\n\n5\n\nQuantization of the Hamiltonian constraint\nThe classical Hamiltonian constraint is given by\n\n\u039b\n\u01ebijk \u01ebabc \u03c3\neai \u03c3\nebj \u03c3\neck + \u01ebijk \u01ebabc \u03c3\neai \u03c3\nebj Bck + G\u03a9 = 0,\n(66)\n6\nwhere \u03a9 is the matter contribution. Substitution of the classical CDJ Ansatz\nresults in one condition relating the invariants of the CDJ matrix, namely\n\u0001\ndetB V ar\u03a8 + \u039bdet\u03a8 + G\u03a9 = 0.\n\n(67)\n\nwhere we have defined V ar\u03a8, the variance of the CDJ matrix, as\nV ar\u03a8 = (tr\u03a8)2 \u2212 tr\u03a82 .\n\n(68)\n\nThe matter contribution in general contains dependence upon the CDJ\nmatrix elements in addition to the matter fields \u03a9 = \u03a9[\u03c6, \u03c0, \u03a8ab ], due to\nthe gravity-matter coupling g\u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd stemming from the Einstein equations\nG\u03bc\u03bd \u221d T\u03bc\u03bd . Unlike for the kinematic constraints, the form of the matter\ncontribution to the Hamiltonian constraint is model-specific.\nSolution of (67) would eliminate one degree of freedom in the CDJ matrix. Combined with the six kinematic constraint solutions this leaves, modulo boundary conditions due to the Gauss' law constraint, two degrees of\n14\nSome interesting relationships between gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms\ncan be found by the interested reader in [27].\n\n18\n\n\ffreedom remaining in the CDJ matrix \u03a8ab . This results in a two-parameter\nambiguity in the solution at the classical level.\nSince we are interested in generalized quantum Kodama states, we must\nsolve the quantized version of the Hamiltonian constraint.

Substitution of\nthe quantized CDJ Ansatz (36) into (69) leads to a condition of the form\n(suppressing the implicit T dependence)\n\u0001\n\u0124(x) \u03a8GKod = q0 (x) + ~G\u03b4(3) (x)q1 (x) + (~G\u03b4(3) (x))2 q2 (x) \u03a8GKod = 0\n(70)\nfor all x in the spatial hypersurface \u03a3T , whereupon the nonlinear action of\nthe Hamiltonian constraint upon the state leads to the presence of singular\nquantum gravitational terms.\nIn a usual field-theoretical treatment, such terms would be regularized\nby some prescription in order to yield a finite result. However, there is\nno guarantee that the result obtained by solving the regularized constraint\nis independent of the regularization prescription [16]. Therefore we shall\ndispense with any regularization procedures altogether in the canonical part\nof our quantum treatment of gravity. Instead, we will show that, due to\nthe choice of the generalized Kodama state, singular terms in the constraint\nequations are cancelled out.\n\n5.1\n\nCosmological contribution to the expansion of the quantized Hamiltonian constraint\n\nThere are a total of three contributions to the quantized Hamiltonian constraint namely the cosmological term, the curvature and the matter terms.\nStarting with the cosmological term H\u039b , suppressing the implicit x dependence,\n\n19\n\n\f\u0124\u039b \u03a8GKod =\n=\n\n\u039b\n\u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4\n\u03a8GKod\n(~G)3 \u01ebijk \u01ebabc a\n6\n\u03b4Ai \u03b4Abj \u03b4Ack\n\n\u039b\n\u03b4 \u03b4\n(\u03a8ce Bek ) \u03a8GKod\n(~G)2 \u01ebijk \u01ebabc a\nb\n6\n\u03b4Ai \u03b4Aj\n\n(71)\n\nIn (71) we have made the CDJ Ansatz \u03c3\neck = \u03a8ce Bek .

The tradeoff is\nthat whereas the former functional differential condition is linear, the latter\npartial differential condition is nonlinear.

This is the classical part of the Hamiltonian constraint\nand also forms the semiclassical part of the SQC.\nNote for x 6= 0 that the quantized Hamiltonian constraint is identically zero due to the delta functions, which have support only at the origin\n(x, t) = (0, t) for all times t in M . So there is an automatically manifest\n24\n\n\fsemiclassical-quantum correspondence for all points not including the spatial origin. But we require that the quantized Hamiltonian constraint be\nsatisfied everywhere, including the origin, as a necessary condition for a\nfinite state. This dictates, and is often put in an abuse of notation, that\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0124 \u03a8GKod = q0 + ~G\u03b4(3) (0)q1 + (~G\u03b4(3) (0))2 q2 \u03a8GKod = 0.\n\n(89)\n\nThe continuity of the SQC imposes conditions on the coefficients of the\nsingular delta functions in (89), namely that q0 = q1 = q2 = 0 for all x on the\nhypersurface \u03a3t for each t. Since the origin of \u03a3 can be arbitrarily chosen,\nthen these conditions must be satisfied at all points x in \u03a3. This implies\ncertain functional relationships in the coefficients q0 , q1 and q2 , amongst the\nfields Aai = Aai (x) and \u03c6\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b1 (x) which must be true for all x independently\nof position in \u03a3. The explicit x dependence of the fields themselves can then\nbe suppressed, since x is merely a dummy label.\n\n6\n\nConstraints corresponding to the finite states of\nquantum gravity\n\nThe existence of \u03a8GKod in the full theory (including minisuperspace as a\nsubset) will depend upon the existence of solutions to the quantum constraints for the CDJ matrix elements for an arbitrary model coupled to\ngravity with cosmological term. As long as (55),(58) and (67) are satisfied,\nquantum states obeying (36) and (41) are semiclassical in the precise sense\nthat these states will be exponentials (of the Hamiltonian function), and the\nHamilton\u2013Jacobi equations will also hold.\nThe resulting condition upon the CDJ matrix elements \u03a8ae is a system\nof nine equations in nine unknowns. This is a total of three equations from\nthe quantized Gauss' law constraints, three equations from the quantized\ndiffeomorphism constraint and three equations from the quantized Hamiltonian constraint.

Note that all\nnine degrees of freedom in the CDJ matrix for \u03a8Kod are exhausted in order\nto produce a unique solution.\nThe basic principle of the nonperturbative quantization of gravity in the\ngeneral case in the full theory is to introduce a driving force to the right\nhand side of (91) corresponding to a particular matter model.

Section 11.1 shows that the analogue of the topological\nF \u2227 F Chern\u2013Simons term for gravity when quantized on an equal footing in\nthe presence of matter fields is simply another representation of \u03a8GKod upon\nsolution to the quantum constraints. We derive and contrast this to work\nof previous authors, which view the CDJ matrix as a Lagrange multiplier\nnecessary to enforce metricity as opposed to our use here. The presence\nof matter fields coupled to gravity does not alter the holographic nature of\nthe state.17 . They simply, in a sense, 'rotate' the holographic ground state\n\u03a8Kod into a new holographic ground state \u03a8GKod .

Complementarily to the matter-free case previously discussed, we shall proceed in\na more direct manner. We will start with the assumption that the wavefunction is a boundary term defined on the final spatial hypersurface \u03a3T at\ntime T , and then explicitly show that this boundary term is the same as\nits four-dimensional version, the precise form of which we will deduce. The\nability to do so without contradiction should suffice to prove our assertion.\n~ )] =\nAssume that there exists a functional \u03a8GKod (T ) = \u03a8GKod [A(T ), \u03c6(T\nI(T\n)\na\n\u03b1\ne\nof two dynamical variables (Ai (x, T ), \u03c6 (x, T )) as determined by the\nsolution to the constraints (93) on the final spatial hypersurface \u03a3T .\nRT\n\n\u03a8(T ) = eI(T ) = eI(T )\u2212I(t0 ) eI(t0 ) = e\n\nt0\n\ndt(dI/dt)\n\n\u03a8(t0 )\n\n(94)\n\n~ 0 )] is the state as determined by the solution to\n\u03a8(t0 ) = \u03a8GKod [A(t0 ), \u03c6(t\nthe constraints (93) on the initial spatial hypersurface \u03a30 .18 On the right\nhand side in the last line of (94), the functional I(T ) is extended from \u03a3T\ninto the interior of M to produce I(t) for t0 \u2264 t \u2264 T .\nNote that the right hand side of (94) is independent of this detailed time\ndependence, since the left hand side is independent of any such dependence\nby the starting assumption.

Equation (43) guarantees\nthat the wavefunctional has the proper polarization to enable these conditions to the determined, and is the correct boundary term corresponding\nto these conditions. Equations (39) and (40) simply follow as a consistency\ncondition that follows from the existence of the aforementioned boundary\nterm and its polarization. It then follows from all these observations that\nthe existence of the generalized Kodama state \u03a8GKod is a natural consequence of the exhaustive application of the canonical quantization relations\nof quantum field theory to gravity in Ashtekar variables in the Schr\u00f6dinger\nrepresentation, which follows from the principle of the SQC.\nProceeding along by substitution of (97) and (98) into (95) leads to\n\nexp\n\nhZ\n\nT\n\nt0\n\n\u03a8(T ) = \u03a8GKod (T ) =\n\u0011i\n\u0010\ni\n\u03a8(t0 ) (100)\ndt d3 x (~G)\u22121 \u03a8ae Bei \u0226ai + \u03c0\u03b1 \u03c6\u0307\u03b1\n~\n\u03a3\nCab =0;~\n\u03c0 =~\n\u03c0f (\u03c6)\nZ\n\nwhere the notation ~\u03c0f (\u03c6) signifies that the mixed partials condition in integrated form has already been incorporated into the solution to the constraints.\nWe now derive the instanton representation of \u03a8GKod , which highlights\nits relation to topological field theory.

In the more general case\nthe CDJ matrix acts as a kind of matter-induced metric on SU (2)\u2212 . Note\nthat since (110) arose from the same starting functional (101) which was\nchosen to be velocity independent and independent of histories within M , it\nfollows that the instanton-like term is as well another representation of the\ngeneralized Kodama state, which is as well velocity and history independent\nand furthermore constitutes the anologue of a topological invariant in the\npresence of matter fields coupled to gravity\nR\n\n\u03a8GKod (T ) = e\n\n~\n\u03c0 *D0 \u03c6\n(~G)\u22121 \u03a8ab F a \u2227F b + ~i ~\n\nM\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03a8GKod (t0 ).\n\n(111)\n\nNote that one can expand the generalized Kodama instanton representation about its pure\n\u0001 Kodama counterpart via the change in variables \u03a8ab =\n\u22121\n\u2212 6\u039b \u03b4ab +\u01ebab , where \u01ebae parametrizes the departure of \u03a8GKod from \u03a8Kod ,\nto obtain\n~ )] = e6(~G\u039b)\u22121\n\u03a8GKod [A(T ), \u03c6(T\n\nR\n\nM\n\nR\n\ntrF \u2227F e\nR\n\n= \u03a8Kod [A(t0 )]e\n\nM\n\nM\n\n~\n\u03c0 *D0 \u03c6\n\u2212(~G)\u22121 \u01ebab F a \u2227F b + ~i ~\n\n~\n\u2212(~G\u039b)\u22121 \u01ebab F a \u2227F b + ~i ~\n\u03c0 *D0 \u03c6\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n.(112)\n\nTo go one step further, the gravitational sector of the generalized Kodama state can be taken 'off-shell' by the introduction of a self-dual two-form\n\u03a3a = \u03a3a\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd .

The quantity (\u03a8\u22121 )ae in (113) would\nhave the interpretation in [28] as the inverse of the self-dual part of the\nWeyl tensor in the SU (2)\u2212 spinor representation \u03a8(ABCD) , which serves as\na Lagrange-multiplier designed to impose compatability of the instanton-like\naction with a metric via the identification (in the language of the present\npaper) \u03a3a \u2227 \u03a3b = 13 \u03b4ab tr\u03a3 \u2227 \u03a3.

We will demonstrate the relationship to\nthe semiclassical-quantum correspondence and how this can lead uniquely\nto such independence. In a more mathematically precise sense, the relationship between geometric quantization and the SQC is none other than the\nequivalence of the reduced phase space and Dirac quantization of a quantum\nsystem,22 which exists only for special states including \u03a8Kod and \u03a8GKod .\nLet us start with the the determination of the pure Kodama state \u03a8Kod .\nOne starts first with a symplectic structure \u03a3 = (\u03c9, M ) with symplectic\n(functional) 2-form \u03a9 on the classical phase space M \u2261 (e\n\u03c3ai (x), Aai (x)) on\nthe configuration space of connections \u0393A living at the point x \u2208 M . The\nsymplectic 2-form on \u03a3 associated to a spatial hypersurface \u03a3t labeled by\ntime t is given by\n\n\u03c9 M = (~G)\u22121\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd3 x \u03b4e\n\u03c3ai (x) \u2227 \u03b4Aai (x),\n\n(115)\n\nwhere the wedge product is taken with respect to the cotangent bundle of\nthe fields at each point x. At the level of (115) the phase space per point is\n18 dimensional. Hence the associated volume form corresponding to (115)\nd\u03bc(A) = w[A]\n\nY\n\n\u03b4e\n\u03c3ai (x) \u2227 \u03b4Aai (x)\n\n(116)\n\na,i\n\nThis does not in general preclude the existence of a metric with which Aai is compatible.\nPointed out in [15] as a requirement for the quantization of a topological theory on a\nspacetime manifold M to lead to a unique quantum state living on the boundary \u2202M\n21\n\n22\n\n33\n\n\fis nonzero. Note that (118) signifies the 18-dimensional phase space volume\nper point x, and w[A] is the weighting factor used in (17). The volume\nform in (118) is nonzero, which in the language of geometric quantization\ncorresponds to a nondegenerate two form \u03c9 M .\nAt the classical level there are seven constraints, which upon solution\nleave a two-parameter ambiguity in the CDJ matrix \u03a8ae . This corresponds\nto a two-parameter ambiguity in the conjugate momentum \u03c3\neai = \u03a8ae Bei at\nthe level of the reduced phase space m. Denote the undetermined momenta,\nwithout loss of generality, by \u03c3\ne11 and \u03c3\ne22 . The volume form on the original (18\ndimensional) phase space M is zero, which means that the corresponding\ntwo form \u03c9 M , though not zero, is degenerate on the space M .

Indeed, the requirement of integrability\nis not met at the naive classical level and it is not in general clear the manner\nin which to construct a state on the boundary \u2202M of spacetime.\nHowever, we will show that the full solution to (91) at the quantum\nlevel removes this ambiguity, enabling the corresponding quantum state to\nbe explicitly constructed. Our argument proceeds as follows. Upon full\ne22 are\nsolution to the quantum constraints, all momenta, including \u03c3\ne11 and \u03c3\na\ncompletely determined by the coordinate variables Ai . The interpretation\nis that the symplectic two-form \u03c9 m in (117) collapses to zero.23 This means\n23\n\nThis is the field-theoretical analogy to finite dimensional systems. Take the harmonic\noscillator with \u03c9 = dp\u2227dq. Upon solution to the constraint of constant energy 2E = p2 +q 2\nthe symplectic two-form reduces to \u03c9 = (2E \u2212 q 2 )\u22121/2 qdq \u2227 dq = 0.\n\n34\n\n\fthat the reduced phase space has decreased from 2 \u2297 \u221e degrees of freedom\nper point to 0 \u2297 \u221e degrees of freedom per point.\nA way to see this is to compute the full original 2-form (115) subject\nto the solution of the quantum constraints (all nine Cab = 0 equations). In\nthis case \u03c9 M on the full phase space collapses into \u03c9 \u0393A on the configuration\nspace. Suppressing x dependence, we have\n\n\u03c9\u0393 = \u03c9M\n\n\u22121\n\nCab =0\n\n= (~G)\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd3 x \u03b4e\n\u03c3ai (x) \u2227 \u03b4Aai (x)\nCab =0\n\n(120)\nExpanding this out, noting that \u03c3\neai (x) = \u03c3\neai [Abj (x)] gives\n\u22121\n\n(~G)\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd x\n\u03a3\n\n\u03b4e\n\u03c3ai (x)\n\n\u2227\n\n\u03b4Aai (x)\n\n\u22121\n\n= (~G)\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\u03a3\n\n\u2202e\n\u03c3ai\n\u03b4Ab \u2227 \u03b4Aai\n\u2202Abj j\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u22022I\nKod\n\u03b4Abj \u2227 \u03b4Aai = 0.\nd3 x\n=\na \u2202Ab\n\u2202A\n\u03a3\ni\nj\n\n(121)\n\nEquation (121) vanishes due to the symmetric indices in the double derivative being contracted with antisymmetric indices in the wedge product.\nTo show explicitly the manner in which \u03a8Kod arises, we argue in analogy\nto the cohomology of manifolds. A closed one-form \u03b8 on a manifold M , such\nthat d\u03b8 = 0 is locally exact by the Poincare Lemma [30]. Hence \u03b8 = d\u03bb for\nsome zero form \u03bb. So the manifold M can then be divided into cohomology\nclasses H 1 (M ) of closed-modulo exact forms. We now extend this to field\ntheory in the following manner. As noted in [4] the symplectic two-form \u03c9 M\ncan be seen as the abelian curvature of a connection one-form, namely the\nsymplectic (canonical) one-form (the analogy to \u03b8 = pdq for the harmonic\noscillator) for a U (1) line bundle, given by\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b8 M = (~G)\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd3 x \u03c3\neai (x)\u03b4Aai (x).\n\n(122)\n\nEquation (122) is a one-form from the perspective of the functional space \u0393A\nof fields Aai , but is actually a four-form on spacetime M integrated over all\nof three-space \u03a3. It also corresponds to the sympletic form on the original\nclassical phase space, prior to implementation of the constraints.\nBut we have shown that \u03c9 M vanishes, which corresponds to the unique\nsolution to the quantum constraints being selected from the two-parameter\nfamily of semiclassical solutions, or the self-duality condition \u03c3\neai = \u22126\u039b\u22121 Bai\nat each point x. The canonical one-form on the reduced phase space then\nbecomes\n35\n\n\f\u22121\n\n(\u03b8 m)Kod = \u22126(~G\u039b)\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\nd3 x Bai (x)\u03b4Aai (x).\n\n(123)\n\nThis enables the integrability condition to be satisfied, in analogy to the\ncohomology of finite dimensional spaces. Hence, since \u03b8 m is closed (\u03c9 m =\n\u03b4\u03b8 m = 0), then it must be 'locally' exact.24 Hence it must be the case that\n\u03b8 m = \u03b4\u03bb for some 'functional' zero-form \u03bb.25 We argue that the determination of this form \u03bb amounts to finding the wavefunction of the universe,\nand is the direct analogue of finding \u03bb \u2208 \u22270 (M ) in the finite dimensional\nR\ncase. The latter can be found directly via the integration \u03bb = \u03b8. The\ninfinite dimensional analogue is to integrate (123) over the functional space\nof fields, which requires that this functional integration commutes with the\nspatial integration d3 x over \u03a3. Hence,\n\n\u03bbKod =\n\nZ\n\n\u0393A\n\n\u22121\n\n= \u22126(~G\u039b)\n\nZ Z\n\nd3 x Bai (x)\u03b4Aai (x)\nZ\u0393 \u03a3 Z\n= \u22126(~G\u039b)\u22121\nd3 x Bai (x)\u03b4Aai (x)\n\u22121\n\n(\u03b8 m)Kod = \u22126(~G\u039b)\n\n\u0393\n\u03a3\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n2\nA \u2227 dA + A \u2227 A \u2227 A = \u22126(~G\u039b)\u22121 ICS [A].\n3\n\u03a3\n\n(124)\n\nThere are a few points to note concerning (124). (i) First, it corresponds\nto an indefinite functional integral over \u0393A . Limits of functional integration\ncan be associated with an initial time t0 and a final time T , determining\nthe 'evolution' of the state between these two times irrespective of histories.\n(ii) Secondly, since the self-duality condition \u03c3\neai (x) = \u22126(\u039b)\u22121 Bai (x) arose\nfrom the Dirac canonical quantization procedure, the reduced phase space\nquantization and Dirac quantization procedures are equivalent for the state,\nwhich can be written as \u03a8Kod = e\u03bbKod , where \u03bbKod \u2208 \u22270 (M ) is an element\nof the functional zero-forms on the configuration space of connections. The\npure Kodama state then has the interpretation of the section of the line\nbundle for which the configuration space \u0393A comprises the base space. (iii)\nThis is a direct consequence of the SQC which resulted in the degeneracy\nof the canonical two-form \u03c9 on the reduced phase space, which is zerodimensional per point x owing to the uniqueness of the state.26 (iv) It can\nbe seen the relationship between functional and time integration which is\nindependent of spatial integration. Also, one is free to select the Lorentzian\nor the Euclidean form of the state via the replacement \u03bbKod \u2194 i\u03bbKod .\n24\n\nLocally in the functional sense on the space of functions per point x.\nA zero-form in the sense of a three-form integrated over all 3-space \u03a3.\n26\nWe will call this the infinite-dimensional functional analogue of the Poincare Lemma,\nfor lack of a more descriptive term.\n25\n\n36\n\n\fWe now argue that the preceding argument extends by direct analogy\nto the generalized Kodama states \u03a8GKod . We will highlight the relevant\ndifferences as we proceed. One starts first with a symplectic structure \u03a3\u2032 =\n(\u03c9 \u2032 , M \u2032 ) with symplectic (functional) 2-form \u03a9\u2032 on the classical phase space\nM \u2032 \u2261 (e\n\u03c3ai (x), Aai (x)\u03c6\u03b1 (x), \u03c0\u03b1 (x)) on the configuration space of connections\nand matter fields \u0393 \u2261 (\u0393A , \u0393\u03c6 ) living at the point x \u2208 M \u2032 . The symplectic\n2-form on \u03a3\u2032 associated to a spatial hypersurface \u03a3t labeled by time t is\ngiven by\n\n\u03c9 \u2032M \u2032\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nh\ni\ni\nd3 x (~G)\u22121 \u03b4e\n\u03c3ai (x) \u2227 \u03b4Aai (x) + \u03b4\u03c0\u03b1 (x) \u2227 \u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 (x)\n~\n\u03a3\n\n(125)\n\nwhere the wedge product is taken with respect to the cotangent space of\nthe fields at each point x. At the level of (125) the configuration space\nper point is 18 + 2N dimensional, where N is the total number of fields\n(components labeled by the index \u03b1) due to the presence of matter. At\nthe classical level there are seven constraints, which upon solution leave a\ntwo-parameter ambiguity in the CDJ matrix \u03a8ae . This corresponds to a\ntwo-parameter ambiguity in the conjugate momentum \u03c3\neai at the level of the\nreduced phase space m for each value of f\u03b1 (\u03c6\u03b2 ) determined by the mixed\npartials condition. In analogy to \u03a8Kod this constitues an obstruction to\nproceeding from the prequantization into the quantization stage, in that the\nsympletic two form does not in general vanish.\nBy solution of the system (92) one eliminates the two-parameter ambiguity to obtain the CDJ matrix \u03a8ae = \u03a8ae [Aai , f\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b1 ], labeled by f\u03b1 , as a\nfunction of the configuration space variables (Aai , \u03c6\u03b1 ). Hence one bypasses\nthe semiclassical level to arrive directly at the conditions delinieating the\nunique quantum state \u03a8GKod .\nIn order to be able to construct \u03a8GKod , we must show that the symplectic\ntwo-form \u03c9 \u2032m\u2032 vanishes on the reduced phase space m\u2032 . It is true that there\nis an ambiguity due to the choice of f\u03b1 , however this does not affect the\n~ is a function\ndetermination of the symplectic two-form since f\u03b1 = f\u03b1 (\u03c6)\n\u03b1\n27\npurely of the matter fields \u03c6 and not of any momenta. The full solution\nto the constraints (92) should result in the determination\n\u03c3\neai = \u03c3\neai (Aai , f\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b1 ); \u03c0\u03b1 = \u03c0\u03b1 (Aai , f\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b1 ),\n\n(126)\n\nor the conjugate momenta, labeled by f\u03b1 , in terms of the configuration space\nvariables. Taking this dependence into account, suppressing the label f\u03b1 ,\n27\nOne possible criteria for the elimination of this freedom in f~ is to demand that it cor~ of the theory of matter quantized\nrespond to \u03b4\u0393ef f [\u03c6]/\u03b4\u03c6\u03b1 for the effective action \u0393ef f [\u03c6]\nin the absence of gravity (limG\u21920 ), such as to produce the correct semiclassical limit.

It then follows\nthat the corresponding canonical one-form is an exact functional differential\n~ The\n\u03b8 \u2032m\u2032 = \u03b4\u03bbGKod for some functional zero-form \u03bbGKod = \u03bbGKod [A, \u03c6].\ngeneralized Kodama state is then given by the exponential of this zero-form\nR\n\n\u03a8GKod = e\n\n\u03b8\u2032m \u2032\n\n= e\u03bbGKod .\n\n(130)\n\nHence, the generalized Kodama state is determined by the integral of the\ncanonical one-form corresponding to the matter-coupled theory. The arguments of this section support the concept that the generalized Kodama\n28\n\nSince all field-theoretical infinities have been factored out in the solution to the constraints functional derivatives can be thought of as partial derivatives at the same spatial\npoint, resembling minisuperspace but in fact still the full theory [25]. We maintain the\nfunctional notation on the one-forms for clarity.\n\n38\n\n\fstate is indeed the generalization of the pure Kodama state from another\nperspective.\n\n8\n\nDiscussion and future directions\n\nWe have delineated a criterion for finiteness of the states of the quantum\ntheory of gravity in the full theory by the introduction of the semiclassicalquantum correpondence. This can be thought of as the search for quantum\nstates which due to cancellation of field-theoretical infinities are also W KB\nstates. The significance of this work is to show that the generalized Kodama\nstates \u03a8GKod are a special class of states of the full theory of quantum gravity, the direct analogue of the pure Kodama state \u03a8Kod in the presence of\nmatter fields. The existence of the generalized Kodama states is a direct\nconsequence of the consistent and exhaustive and application of the canonical commutation relations to quantum gravity in Ashtekar variables in the\nfunctional Schr\u00f6dinger representation.\nWe have also shown how \u03a8GKod is restricted to any chosen spatial hypersurface \u03a3T of spacetime in the presence of matter fields, in analogy to\na similar holographic effect for the pure Kodama states \u03a8Kod . The ability\nto construct the wavefunction \u03a8GKod hinges crucially upon the ability to\nobtain solutions to the set of nine equations Cab = 0 for the CDJ matrix\nelements \u03a8ae for the full theory stemming from the quantum constraints.\nThe integrated form of the mixed partials condition, a consistency condition arising from the quantization procedure, must be solved in conjunction\nwith this system in order to obtain a wavefunction solely of configuration\nspace variables defined on the final spatial hypersurface \u03a3T of spacetime\n~ on this mixed partials\nM = \u03a3 \u00d7 R. The boundary condition f\u03b1 = f\u03b1 (\u03c6)\ncondition provides a possible link from quantized gravity to its associated\nsemiclassical limit in the case of the generalized Kodama states \u03a8GKod .\nWe have also provided a variety of representations for the generalized\nKodama states \u03a8GKod including arguments from geometric quantization, the\nnatural generalization of the Chern\u2013Simons instanton term to include matter\nfields, as well as arguments for independence of field bulk configurations.\nThe principle of the SQC establishes that the reduced phase space, Dirac\nand geometric quantization procedures unambiguously produce the same\nquantum state for the generalized Kodama states by construction. This is\nsignificant in that the usual ambiguities inherent in the quantization of a\ngiven theory via different quantization schemes are absent in the case of\nthe generalized Kodama states. It is anticipated that this feature should\nfacilitate examination of the semiclassical limit of the quantum theory for\nthese states.\nA next step is to establish equivalence of the three quantization proce-\n\n39\n\n\fdures considered in this paper to the path integral quantization procedure\nintroduced in [12]. In this way we hope to show how several issues in quantum gravity can be resolved using these states. Also, we hope to illustrate\nin greater detail the specific algorithm to construct solutions to the constraints by inspection, both for minisuperspace and for the full theory, and\nfrom these solutions demonstrate the explicit construction of the generalized\nKodama states for a wide class of models. Additional future directions will\ninclude but are not limited to those mentioned in the introduction.\n\n9\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to than Ed Anderson for his open-mindedness, guidance, advice\nand support during various lenghty discussions regarding the initial drafts\nof my work, as well as advice in various aspects of paper writing, as well as\nhis patience and recommendations in reading over the final version.
