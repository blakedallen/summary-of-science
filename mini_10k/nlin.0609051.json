The force brakes detailed balance, maintained otherwise, thus producing entropy. The large deviation\nfunction of the entropy production in the system is calculated explicitly. The general result is illustrated using\nan example of a polymer immersed in a gradient flow and subject to thermal fluctuations.\nPACS numbers: 83.80.Rs,05.70.Ln,05.10.Gg\n\nThe Gibbs distribution, Peq (x) \u223c exp[\u2212U (x)/T ], describes the probability for a system characterized by the microscopic potential U (x) and maintained at equilibrium at\ntemperature T to be observed in the state x. In particular,\nin our model case of a polymer the elastic potential U (x)\ndepends on the end-to-end position vector x. The system\nat equilibrium maintains the detailed balance, which is the\nmost fundamental principle of equilibrium statistical mechanics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Formally, the detailed balance means\nthat the probabilities P{x} and P{x\u2217 } for a stochastic trajectory, {x} \u2261 {x(t\u2032 ); 0 < t\u2032 < t} and its \"conjugated twin\"\n{x}\u2217 \u2261 {x\u2217 (t\u2032 ) = x(t \u2212 t\u2032 ); 0 < t\u2032 < t} are related by\nin balance:\n\nln\n\nU (x(t)) \u2212 U (x(0))\nP{x}\n=\n.\nP{x\u2217 }\nT\n\n(1)\n\nAsymmetric external force breaks down the detailed balance.\nFor example, a shearing flow forces the polymer to tumble and\nresults in steady entropy production [6, 7]. In general, configurational entropy is naturally defined as a mismatch between\nthe left and right hand sides of Eq. (1):\noff ballance: S = ln\n\nP{x\u2217 } U (x(t))\u2212U (x(0))\n+\n6= 0. (2)\nP{x}\nT\n\nFor a wide class of thermalized systems, driven out of equilibrium by external non-conservative forces the entropy has\nalso a standard thermodynamic interpretation: It determines\nthe total heat produced by the system over time t. In the offdetailed balance case entropy is a fluctuating function of the\nentire configurational trajectory {x}. Therefore, in the statistically steady non-equilibrium case fluctuations occur on the\ntop of a steady mean growth of the entropy and one can argue that at sufficiently large observation time the distribution\nfunction of the produced entropy S takes a large deviation\nform [8, 9]:\nP(S|t) \u223c exp [\u2212tL(S\u03c4 /t)/\u03c4 ] ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the typical correlation (turnover) time of the system and L(\u03c9) is referred to as the large deviation function.\nDescription of the large deviation function for a truly nonequilibrium problem is a difficult task, and only a few successful results have been reported so far [10]. To clarify the\n\ndifficulty let us also mention that a simpler problem of finding an off-detailed balance analog of the Gibbs distribution,\nposed in a classical work of Onsager [11], has been solved\nfor a few examples only. ( See [12, 13, 14] for discussion of\nsome difficulties, progress and results achieved on this thorny\npath.) It is worth to note that the large deviation function of\nentropy production was computed and verified experimentally\nfor a number of other physical situation, e.g. optically dragged\nBrownian particles, electrical circuits and forced harmonic oscillators [15]. Although these works are ideologically similar, technically they study different non-equilibrium systems,\nwhich are either non-steady or do not have the detailed balance broken.\nIn this letter we present a solution of this challenging task\nfor a wide class of linear problems driven by multiplicative\nasymmetric \"force\" and also connected to a Langevin reservoir. Such problems arise whenever a statistically steady\nnon-equilibrium state is externally driven by space (x)dependent non-conservative external forces. In this context\nour main physical example is of a Hookean polymer stretched\nand sheared by a mild constant external flow. For this linear\nnon-equilibrium setting we report an explicit expression for\nthe large deviation function of the entropy production. For\nthe most general case our result is given as a solution of a\nwell-defined system of algebraic equations or, alternatively,\nin terms of an one-dimensional integral Eq. (16). For the\nlinear polymer in a constant gradient flow the large deviation\nfunction is presented in terms of elementary functions, see\ne.g. Eq. (13). The most important features of the results for\nthe large deviation function derived in this Letter are:\n\u20221 The steady state solutions are consistent with the fluctuation theorem [16, 17, 18]:\nL(\u03c9) \u2212 L(\u2212\u03c9) = \u2212\u03c9.\n\n(4)\n\n\u20222 The large deviation function is found to be very different\nfrom the Gaussian shape. Extreme tails of the entropy PDF\nare exponential, that are the steepest tails allowed by the large\ndeviation form (3).\n\u20223 One observes reduction in the number of parameters affecting the shape of the large deviation function. For example, the\n\n\f2\nlarge deviation function is completely insensitive to the symmetric part of the velocity gradient in the case of the linear\npolymer immersed in a 2d flow.\nThe letter is organized as follows. After introducing the\npolymer in a flow example, we focus on this model calculating the entropy production and defining the corresponding\ngenerating function. We further derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the generating function and solve it using a Gaussian\nansatz for the related eigenvalue problem. This results in a\nsystem of matrix algebraic equations that define the principle\npart of the longest-time asymptotic of the generating function.\nThe solution for the most general case of two-dimensional\nflow is expressed in terms of elementary functions. This explicit description is also extended to a special three dimensional case. Then, we switch to a general linear model with\na constant multiplicative force. The general model, defined\nin Eq. (14), is analyzed using a direct solution of the linear\nstochastic equations followed by averaging the resulting expression for the generating function over the Langevin noise.\nThis method is complementary to the aforementioned FokkerPlanck approach. The final result for the large time asymtptotic of the generating function is presented in terms of the\none-dimensional integral over frequency.\nThe polymer's end-to-end vector, xi satisfies a stochastic\nequation of motion [19]\n\u1e8bi \u2212 \u03c3ij xj = \u2212\u2202xi U (x) + \u03bei ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the traceless matrix \u03c3\u0302 describes the local value of the\nvelocity gradient in the generic incompressible flow (i =\n1, * * * , d). The smoothness of velocity on the scale of an\neven very extended polymer is justified by many experimental observations, see e.g. [19]. Eq.(5) describes the balance\nof forces: the second term on the lhs represents the polymer deformation by the velocity field. The two terms on\nthe rhs of Eq.(5) account for the polymer elasticity and for\nthe Langevin thermal noise. In this Letter we consider a deterministic constant gradient flow, \u03c3\u0302 = const and focus on\nthe case of a relatively weak \u03c3\u0302 and linear model of Hookean\npolymer, UH (x) = x2 /(2\u03c4 ). Yet, we will also discuss the\nother extreme of a stretched nonlinear polymer in a strong\ngradient flow. The Langevin term in Eq.(5) is modeled by\nthe zero mean white Gaussian noise with h\u03bei (t)\u03bej (t\u2032 )i =\n2T \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4ij .\nAccording to Eq. (5) the probability for a stochastic polymer trajectory in the configuration space is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z t\n2\ndt\u2032 (\u1e8b \u2212 \u03c3\u0302x + \u2202x U (x)) /(4T ) ,\nP{x} \u223c exp \u2212\n0\n\nwith the entropy production (2) along the path {x} (see e.g.\n[20] for details)\nZ t\n\u0001\nS=\ndt\u2032 \u1e8b\u03b1 (t\u2032 ) \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03b2\u03b1 x\u03b2 (t\u2032 )/(2T ) + O(1), (6)\n0\n\nwhere the longest-time t/\u03c4 \u226b 1 statistics of S is naturally\ndescribed within O(t/\u03c4 ).\n\nThe Fokker-Planck technique is applied via relating the\nlarge deviation function to its generating function defined by\nZq \u2261 hexp (\u2212qS)i\u03be .\n\n(7)\n\nUtilizing the large deviation asymptotic (3) we can reformulate averaging over the Langevin noise in Eq. (7) in terms of\nintegration over S and further evaluate the integral using the\nsaddle-point approximation (justified for the asymptotically\nlong time). This establishes the following Legendre transform\nrelation between the generating and the large deviation functions:\nZq \u223c exp (\u2212 (L(\u03c9q ) \u2212 \u03c9q L\u2032 (\u03c9q )) t/\u03c4 ) ,\n\n\u2212q = L\u2032 (\u03c9q ). (8)\n\nSubstituting Eqs. (6) into the definition (7) followed by averaging over the stochastic dynamics (5) we arrive at the FokkerPlanck equation:\n\u2202t Zq = L\u0302q Zq ,\n\u03b1\n\nL\u0302q = \u2212\u2207\n\n\u03c3\n\n(9)\n\u0001\n\u03b1 \u03b1\nx \u2212 \u2202x\u03b1 U (x) + T \u2207 \u2207 , (10)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b2\n\n\u2207\u03b1 = \u2202 \u03b1 + q(\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c3\u0302 + )\u03b1\u03b2 x\u03b2 /(2T ),\n\nwhere the \"gauge\" term \"elongates\" the derivatives in a standard way. Assuming that the operator L\u0302q has a discrete spectrum, the large time asymptotics of Zq is completely dominated by the ground state of L\u0302q . Therefore, the large deviation function is fully described by its ground-state eigen-value\nand, specifically, its dependence on q.\nHere we consider the case when velocity gradient is relatively weak compared to the elastic force (or when stretching components in \u03c3\u0302 are zero) so that the steady state is\nachieved in the regime when elasticity in Eq.(10) is linear,\nU (x) = x2 /(2\u03c4 ) (the so-called coiled, rather then stretched,\nstate.) The spectral problem (9) in the case of Hookean elasticity is of an \"integrable\" type and is similar to a singleparticle quantum mechanics in a constant magnetic field,\nwhen the ground-state eigen-function is Gaussian. Therefore, one looks for the solution of Eq. (9) in a form Zq =\nexp(\u2212\u03bbq t) exp[\u2212xi Bqij xj /(2T )], with B\u0302 being a d \u00d7 d symmetric matrix. Substituting the Gaussian ansatz into Eq. (9)\nwe derive the following eigen-value relations for B\u0302q and \u03bbq :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bbq = tr B\u0302q + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 1\u0302/\u03c4 , M\u0302 + M\u0302 + = 0,\n(11)\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\nM\u0302 \u2261 B\u0302q +q(\u03c3\u0302\u2212 \u03c3\u0302 + )/2 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 1\u0302/\u03c4 + B\u0302q \u2212q(\u03c3\u0302\u2212 \u03c3\u0302 + )/2 ,\n\nthat correspond to x2 exp(...) and exp(...) terms, respectively.\nEqs. (11) are generic, i.e. valid for the full formulation given\nby Eqs.(9,10); the \u03bb0 = 0 and the q = 0 version of Eqs. (11)\ndefines the steady distribution function for the end-to-end\npolymer length x (see, e.g. [14]).\nFor the 2 \u00d7 2 traceless velocity gradient matrix \u03c311 =\n\u2212\u03c322 = a and \u03c312 = b + c, \u03c321 = b \u2212 c one derives from\nEq. (11)\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n1 + 4q(1 \u2212 q)c2 \u03c4 2 \u2212 1 \u03c4 \u22121 ,\n(12)\n\u03bbq =\n\n\f3\n\nNote that, first, L(\u03c9) satisfies the fluctuation theorem (4); and,\nsecond, the asymptotics of L(\u03c9) at |\u03c9| \u226b c\u03c4 are both linear in \u03c9, making the extreme deviation asymptotics of the\nentire distribution function of S exponential and time independent. Tracking the origin of the exponential tails back\nto a special form of the generating function (12), one finds\nthat these extreme asymptotics correspond to the square root\nsingularity of \u03bbq at q\u00b1 . Time-independence of the P(S|t)\nasymptotics means that typical trajectories contributing the\nPDF tail are correlated at some finite times, so that the observational time t increase does not change corresponding probabilities. Figure 1 shows the large deviation function given\nby Eq. (13) verified versus Brownian dynamics simulations.\nIn the case of a d = 3 gradient flow the algebraic system\nof Eqs. (11) is too complicated to allow a solution in terms\nof elementary functions for an arbitrary form of the velocity\ngradient matrix \u03c3\u0302. Thus we mention only a special example of a 3d flow with the following nonzero elements of \u03c3\u0302:\n\u03c311 = \u2212a1 , \u03c322 = a1 + a2 , \u03c333 = \u2212a2 , \u03c313 = c, \u03c331 = \u2212c.\nIn this case the generating function and the large deviation\nfunction is given by Eqs. (13) modified according to the following simple renormalization of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 /|1 + a\u03c4 | (and \u03c9\nrespectively).\nAn alternative derivation of the large deviation function\nstarts with considering a general linear problem\n\u1e8bi = \u03a6ij xj + \u03a5ij \u03bej ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0302 and \u03a5\u0302 are arbitrary constant matrices. Eq. (14) describes linear stochastic dynamics around a fixed point, that\ncan be stable or unstable. We discuss here a truly nonequilibrium (off-detailed balance) steady state maintained if\nthe fluctuations do not exceed a threshold so that nonlinear effects can be ignored (see [14] and references therein). A flux\nstate observed in diffusive system [22] is a popular example\nthat involves an infinite-dimensional configurational variable\nx. Many examples of the off-detailed balance steady systems,\n\n12\n\nQ, Large Deviation Functional\n\nwhere the generating function and the eigenvalue of the\nground state are well defined only p\nwithin a finite interval,\nq \u2208 [q\u2212 ; q+ ], where q\u00b1 \u2261 1/2 \u00b1 1/4 \u2212 1/(c2 \u03c4 2 ). Notice that the eigen-value \u03bbq given by Eq. (12) does not depend on the symmetric part of \u03c3\u0302, even though the resulting B\u0302q\nfunction does depend explicitly on both symmetric and antisymmetric components. Formally this reflects the invariance\nof the Fokker-Planck operator with respect to a family of isospectral transformations that keep the spectra (or at least its\nground state) invariant. We do not know however a physically\nintuitive explanation for this remarkable symmetry/reduction\nin the model. A similar and equally surprising phenomenon\nof reduction in the degrees-of-freedom number that control\nthe large deviation function of a current has been recently\nreported for a different non-equilibrium system that models\na contact between two thermostats kept at different temperatures [10]. Combining Eqs. (8,12) leads to\np\n(13)\nL(\u03c9) = (1 + c2 \u03c4 2 )(4c2 \u03c4 2 + \u03c9 2 ) \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c9/2.\n\ns=.5\ns=1\ns=2\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\nw, entropy production rate\n\nFIG. 1: Large deviation function in d = 2 for three values of the\ngoverning parameter c\u03c4 = 1.; 2.; 4.

Obviously,\nthe \u03a5\u0302 = 1\u0302 version of Eq. (14) describes the aforemention twobeads Hookean polymer model as well, however it is worth\nmentioning that the full version of Eq. (14) also appears naturally in a more general polymer context, where the \u03a5\u0302 6= 1\u0302\ncase models hydrodynamic interactions between the different\nparts of the polymer chain [19]. Eq. (14) also describes fluctuations around a stretched state above the coil-stretch transition\n[25, 26, 27] in a strong gradient flow [28].\nAccording to Eq. (2) the entropy production in the system\nRt\ndescribed by Eq. (14) is given by S = 0 dt\u2032 \u1e8b+ (t\u2032 )(K\u0302 \u03a6\u0302 \u2212\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u03a6\u0302+ K\u0302)x(t\u2032 )/(2T ), where K\u0302 \u2261 \u03a5\u0302\u03a5\u0302+\n. To discuss dynamics at large but finite time t it is convenient to invoke a\ndiscrete (a-la Matsubara) frequency representation\nX\n\u221a\nx(t\u2032 ) =\n(ck exp(i\u03c9k t\u2032 ) + c\u2217k exp(\u2212i\u03c9k t\u2032 )) / t,\nk\n\n!\nZY\nX \u2020\n\u2217\nDck Dck exp \u2212\nZq =\nck Aq (\u03c9k )ck /(2T ) , (15)\nk\n\nk\n\nAq (\u03c9) \u2261 \u03c9 2 K\u0302 + \u03a6\u0302+ K\u0302 \u03a6\u0302 + i\u03c9(1 \u2212 2q)(K\u0302 \u03a6\u0302 \u2212 \u03a6\u0302+ K\u0302),\n\nwhere \u03c9k \u2261 2\u03c0k/t, k = 1, 2, . . . .\nStraightforward\nGaussian\nintegration\nin\nEq.\n(15)\nyields:\n\u03bbq t =\nP\nlog(det\nA\n(\u03c9\n)/\ndet\nA\n(\u03c9\n)).\nIn\nthe\nt\n\u2192\n\u221e\nlimit\none\nq\nk\n0\nk\nk\nreplaces summation over k by integration and arrives at\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c9\ndet Aq (\u03c9)\n\u03bbq =\nlog\n,\n(16)\n2\u03c0\ndet A0 (\u03c9)\n0\nwhich is the most general long-time asymptotic result reported\nin this letter. It is straightforward to verify that in the special case of linear polymer advected by d = 2 gradient flow,\n\u03a6\u0302 = \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 1\u0302/\u03c4 , and Langevin driving, \u03a5\u0302 = 1\u0302, the integral representation (16) for \u03bbq turns into Eq. (12) derived earlier using\nthe spectral method.\n\n\f4\nNote that Eq. (16) also suggests a convenient way to determine the values of q\u00b1 for a general linear system (14). One\nfinds that q+ is a minimal positive value of q for which a solution of the equation det Aq (\u03c9) = 0 does exist. The value\nof \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2217 which solves this equation is related to the characteristic time-scale of an optimal fluctuation which controls the\nexponential tail of the entropy PDF. For the two-dimensional\npolymer problem\n\u221a this leads to the following explicit expression for \u03c9\u2217 = 1 + c2 \u2212 a2 \u2212 b2 /\u03c4 . The limit of \u03c9\u2217 \u2192 0\ncorresponds to the coil-stretch transition.\nWe conclude compiling an incomplete list of future challenges related to the approach and results reported in this Letter. First, our analysis of the entropy production in a polymer\nsystem extends to the case of chaotic flows, e.g. realized in\nthe recently discovered elastic turbulence [21]. Of a particular\ninterest here is to check sensitivity of the large deviation function to the coil-stretch transition observed in the chaotic problem [25, 26, 27]. Second, introducing a finite time protocol for\na controlled parameter (e.g. shear in the polymer solution experiments) one may be interested to go beyond the analysis of\nthe stationary problem, in particular discussing an off-detailed\nbalance version of the Jarzynski relation [5, 20, 29, 30, 31].\nThis may also help to reconstruct (experimentally or numerically) the non-equilibrium steady-state landscape that would\nbe akin to experiments currently developed for the systems\nthat do not violate the detailed balance, see e.g. [32]. Newly\ndeveloped experimental techniques that allow to track polymers in regular [33] and chaotic [34] flows may be very useful\nfor such applications. Finally, entropy production is closely\nrelated to the flux over spatial scales in the Kolmogorov-like\ncascade solutions of turbulence [35]. Studying fluctuations\nof the entropy production in turbulence by experimental, numerical and theoretical means may have a tremendous impact\non understanding of this most challenging problem in nonequilibrium physics.\nThis work was carried out under the auspices of the National Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy at Los Alamos National Laboratory under\nContract No. DE-AC52-06NA25396.

(5) with U (x) = \u03b3(x)x2 /2, where the nonlinear relaxation\nrate, \u03b3(x), is a monotonic function of the polymer length with\n\u03b3(0) = \u03c4 \u22121 < \u03b3(xmax ) = +\u221e, and the largest eigenvalue \u03bc\nof \u03c3\u0302 satisfies \u03bc\u03c4 > 1 [26, 27]. Deterministic polymer dynamics has a fixed point X : \u03c3\u0302X = \u03b3(X)X . Thermal fluctuations\naround the stable fixed point, y = x \u2212 X , are described by\nthe linear equation \u1e8f = \u03c3\u0302y \u2212 \u03b3(X)y \u2212 \u03b3 \u2032 (X)(X y)X + \u03be,\nthat is a particular case of Eq. (14). The equation is valid only\nfor small fluctuations near the fixed points X or \u2212X, present\nin the problem. It does not explain thermally driven tunneling\n(tumbling) between the fixed points. However, for syfficiently\nsmall temperature the tunneling is weak and its contribution to\nthe total entropy production is negligible.\n[29] C. Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997); Phys.Rev.
