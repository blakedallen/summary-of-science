This may also support\nthe possibility that CTCs may be viable in some physical situations, and may be a natural\ningredient in pre\u2013Big\u2013Bang cosmological scenarios.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction and Motivation\n\nThe Taub-NUT spacetime [1, 2] is an interesting one. We can write a metric for it as follows:\nds2 = \u2212f1 (dt \u2212 l cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + f1\u22121 dr 2 + (r 2 + l2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\nMr + l2\nf1 = 1 \u2212 2 2\n.\n(2)\nr + l2\nThe angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the standard angles parameterizing an S 2 with ranges 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0,\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0. In addition to simple time translation invariance, the metric has an SO(3)\n\ninvariance acting as rotations on the S 2 . To preserve d\u03be = dt \u2212 l cos \u03b8d\u03c6, a time translation\nmust also accompany a general rotation. This makes t periodic with period 4l\u03c0, which can be\n\ndeduced by asking for there to be no conical singularities in the North or South poles. The\ncoordinate t is fibred over the S 2 making a squashed S 3 , and the full invariance is under an\nSU(2) action on this space.\nThere are two very different regions of this spacetime, as one moves in r, distinguished by the\nsign of f1 (r). The regions are separated by the loci (with S 3 topology)\nr\u00b1 = M \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\nM 2 + l2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere f1 vanishes. They are, in a sense, horizons. The metric is singular there, but there exist\nextensions the nature of which is subtle in General Relativity (for a review, see ref. [3]). One\nof the things which we will discuss in detail later is the fact that the string theory provides an\nextremely natural extension.\nThe region r\u2212 < r < r+ has f1 (r) < 0. The coordinate r plays the role of time, and the\n\ngeometry changes as a function of time. This is the \"Taub\" cosmology, and spatial slices have\nthe topology of an S 3 . The volume of the universe begins at r = r\u2212 at zero, it expands to a\nmaximum value, and then contracts to zero again at r = r+ . This is a classical \"Big Bang\"\nfollowed by a classical \"Big Crunch\".\nOn either side of this Taub region, f1 (r) > 0. The coordinate t plays the role of time, and we\nhave a static spatial geometry, but since t is periodic, it is threaded by closed time\u2013like curves.\nConstant radial slices have the topology of an S 3 where the time is a circle fibred over the S 2 .\nThese regions are called the \"NUT\" regions.\nIt is fascinating to note that the Taub and NUT regions are connected. There are geodesics\nwhich can pass from one region to another, and analytic extensions of the metric can be written\n2\n\n\fdown [3]. The geometry is therefore interesting, since it presents itself as a laboratory for the\nstudy of a cosmology which naturally comes capped with regions containing CTCs. Classical\nphysics would seem to suggest that one can begin within the cosmological region and after\nwaiting a finite time, find that the universe contained closed time\u2013like loops.\nIt is an extremely natural question to ask whether or not this is an artifact of classical physics,\na failure of General Relativity to protect itself from the apparent pathologies with which such\ntime machines seem to be afflicted. This leads to a closer examination of the neighbourhood\nof the loci f1 (r) = 0 located at r = r\u00b1 , which we shall call (adopting common parlance)\n\"chronology horizons\". For small \u03c4 = r \u2212 r\u2212 , we see that f1 = \u2212c\u03c4 , where c is a constant, and\nwe get for the (\u03c4, \u03be) plane:\n\nds2 = \u2212(c\u03c4 )\u22121 d\u03c4 2 + c\u03c4 d\u03be 2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich is the metric of a two dimensional version of the \"Milne\" Universe, or \"Misner space\" [4].\nIt is fibred over the S 2 .\nThere is an early study of cosmological singularities of this type in a semi\u2013classical quantum\ntreatment, reported on in ref. [5]. There, the vacuum stress\u2013energy tensor for a conformally\ncoupled scalar field in the background is computed, and it diverges at \u03c4 = 0. This is taken\nby some as an encouraging sign that a full theory of quantum gravity might show that the\ngeometry is unstable to matter fluctuations and the appropriate back\u2013reaction should give a\ngeometry which is modified at the boundaries between the Taub and NUT regions. In fact, this\nis the basis of the \"chronology protection conjecture\" of ref. [6], which suggests (using Taub\u2013\nNUT as a one of its key examples) that the full physics will conspire to forbid the creation of\nCTCs in a spacetime that does not already have them present, i.e., the Misner geometry of the\nchronology horizon is destroyed and replaced by a non\u2013traversable region1 . The expectations\nof a full theory of quantum gravity in this regard are (at least) two\u2013fold: (1) It should prescribe\nexactly what types of matter propagate in the geometry, and; (2) It should give a prescription\nfor exactly how the geometry is modified, incorporating any back\u2013reaction of the matter on the\ngeometry in a self\u2013consistent way.\nSince the papers of ref. [5, 6], a lot has happened in fundamental physics. In particular, it is\nmuch clearer that there is a quantum theory of gravity on the market. It should allow us to\nstudy the questions above2 . Of course, we are referring to string theory (including its not yet\n1\n\nEven staying within Relativity, there are many who take an alternative view, by e.g., showing that a non\u2013\ndivergent stress tensor can be obtained by computing in a different vacuum, thus calling into the question the\nneed for such a conjecture. See for example, refs. [7\u201316] and for a recent stringy example, see ref. [17].\n2\nLeaving aside the question of CTCs, cosmological singularities of Misner type have recently become relevant\nin the context of cosmologies inspired by string\u2013 (and M\u2013) theory. See for example ref. [18]\n\n3\n\n\ffully defined non\u2013perturbative completion in terms of M\u2013theory). While the theory has yet to\nbe developed to the point where we can address the physics of spacetime backgrounds in as\ndextrous a way as possible, there are many questions which we can ask of the theory, and in\ncertain special cases, we can study certain spacetime backgrounds in some detail.\nIn fact, as we will recall in the next section, the Taub\u2013NUT spacetime can be embedded into\nstring theory in a way that allows its most important features to be studied in a very controlled\nlaboratory, an exact conformal field theory [19]. It is therefore not just accessible as a solution\nto the leading order in an expansion in small \u03b1\u2032 (the inverse string tension), but to all orders and\nbeyond. Leading order captures only the physics of the massless modes of the string, (the low\nenergy limit) and so any back\u2013reaction effecting the geometry via high\u2013energy effects cannot\nbe studied in this limit. With the full conformal field theory one can in principle extract the\ncomplete geometry, including all the effects of the infinite tower of massive string states that\npropagate in it. We do this in the present paper and extract the fully corrected geometry. We\nobserve that the key features of the geometry survive to all orders in \u03b1\u2032 , even though placed in\na string theory setting without any special properties to forbid corrections. This result means\nthat a large family of high energy effects which could have modified the geometry are survived\nby the full string theory. The string seem to propagate in this apparently pathological geometry\nwith no trouble at all. It is of course possible that the new geometry we find is unstable to\nthe presence of a test particle or string, but this type of effect does not show up in the CFT\nin this computation. Such test\u2013particle effects are important to study3 in order to understand\nthe complete fate of the geometry by studying its stability against fluctuations. Our work here\nyields the fully corrected geometry in which such probe computations should be carried out in\nthis context. More properly, the probe computation should be done in the full conformal field\ntheory, in order to allow the string theory to respond fully to the perturbation. The conformal\nfield theory discussed here is a complete laboratory for such studies, and as it describes the\nTaub\u2013NUT geometry, it provides the most natural stringy analogue of this classic geometry\nwithin which to answer many interesting questions4 .\nIn section 2, we recall the stringy Taub\u2013NUT metric discovered in ref. [19], and write it in a new\ncoordinate which gives it a natural extension exhibiting the Taub and NUT regions and their\n3\n\nThey have been found for the leading order geometry in its form as an orbifold of Minkowski space by a\nLorentz boost [20\u201324].\n4\nThere are a number of other interesting conformal field theories (and studies thereof) which have been\npresented, which at low energy describe geometries which although are not Taub\u2013NUT spacetimes, do share\nmany of the key features in local patches. Some of them are listed in refs. [25\u201340]. Refs. [39,40] also contain useful\ncomments and literature survey. There are also many papers on the properties of string theory in spacetimes\nwith CTCs, such as the BMPV [41] spacetime [42\u201354] and the G\u00f6del [55] spacetime [56\u201362].\n\n4\n\n\fconnection via Misner space. We also recall the work of refs. [63\u201365] which demonstrates how to\nobtain the low energy metric as a stringy embedding by starting with the standard Taub\u2013NUT\nmetric of equation (1). It is the \"throat\" or \"near\u2013horizon\" region of this spacetime that was\ndiscovered in ref. [19], where an exact conformal field theory (a \"heterotic coset model\") can be\nconstructed which encodes the full stringy corrections. We review the conformal field theory\nconstruction in sections 3.1 and 3.2, where the Lagrangian definition is reviewed. Happily, the\nextension of the throat geometry we present in section 2 (described by the same conformal\nfield theory) contains all the interesting features: the Taub region with its Big\u2013Bang and Big\u2013\nCrunch cosmology, the NUT regions with their CTCs, and the Misner space behaviour which\nseparates them. Therefore we have a complete string theory laboratory for the study of the\nproperties of Taub\u2013NUT, allowing us to address many of the important questions raised in\nthe Relativity community. For example, questions about the analytic extension from the NUT\nto the Taub regions are put to rest by the fact that the full conformal field theory supplies a\nnatural extension via the structure of SL(2, R) (section 2). Further, having the full conformal\nfield theory means that we can construct the \u03b1\u2032 corrections to the low energy metric, and we\ndo so in section 3.6, capturing all of the corrections, after constructing an exact effective action\nin sections 3.4 and 3.5. We analyze the exact metric in section 3.7, and end with a discussion\nin section 4, noting that there are many questions that can be answered in this laboratory by\ndirect computation in the fully defined model.\n\n2\n\nStringy Taub\u2013NUT\n\nTaub\u2013NUT spacetime, being an empty\u2013space solution to the Einstein equations, is trivially\nembedded into string theory with no further work. It satisfies the low\u2013energy equations of\nmotion of any string theory, where the dilaton is set to a constant and all the other background\nfields are set to zero. This is not sufficient for what we want to do, since we want to have a\nmeans of getting efficient computational access to the stringy corrections to the geometry. A\nnew embedding must be found which allows such computational control.\nThis was achieved some time ago. An exact conformal field theory describing the Taub\u2013NUT\nspacetime (in a certain \"throat\" or \"near\u2013horizon\" limit) was constructed in ref. [19]. This\nCFT will be described in the next section. The geometry comes with a non\u2013trivial dilaton and\nanti\u2013symmetric tensor field, together with some electric and magnetic fields. The string theory\nis heterotic string theory. This model is in fact the earliest non\u2013trivial embedding of Taub\u2013NUT\ninto string theory, and uses a novel construction known as \"heterotic coset models\" in order to\n5\n\n\fdefine the theory [19, 66\u201368]. The technique was discovered as a method of naturally defining\n(0, 2) conformal field theories, i.e., backgrounds particularly adapted to yielding minimally\nsupersymmetric vacua of the heterotic string. That aspect will not be relevant here, since we\nwill not tune the model in order to achieve spacetime supersymmetry.\nThe low\u2013energy metric of the stringy Taub\u2013NUT spacetime was presented in ref. [19] as (in\nstring frame):\n\u001a\n\u001b\ncosh2 \u03c3 \u2212 1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds = k d\u03c3 \u2212\n,\n(5)\n(dt \u2212 \u03bb cos \u03b8d\u03c6) + d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8d\u03c6\n(cosh \u03c3 + \u03b4)2\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 \u221e, \u03b4 \u2265 1, \u03bb \u2265 0. The dilaton behaves as:\n1\n\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a60 = \u2212 ln(cosh \u03c3 + \u03b4) ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nand there are other fields which we will discuss later. This is in fact the NUT region of the\ngeometry, and \u03c3 = 0 is a Misner horizon. We note here that the embedding presents a natural\nanalytic extension of this model which recovers the other NUT region and the Taub cosmology\nas well: Replace cosh \u03c3 with the coordinate x:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nx2 \u2212 1\ndx2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n,\n(7)\n\u2212\n(dt \u2212 \u03bb cos \u03b8d\u03c6) + d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8d\u03c6\nds = k\nx2 \u2212 1 (x + \u03b4)2\nwith\n\n1\n\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a60 = \u2212 ln(x + \u03b4) ,\n(8)\n2\nwhere now \u2212\u221e \u2264 x \u2264 +\u221e. The three ranges of interest are 1 \u2264 x \u2264 +\u221e, (x = cosh \u03c3) which\nis the first NUT region above, \u2212\u221e \u2264 x \u2264 \u22121 (x = \u2212 cosh \u03c3) which is a second NUT region,\nand \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 +1 (x = \u2212 cos \u03c4 ), which is a Taub region with a Big Bang at \u03c4 = 0 and a\n\nBig Crunch at \u03c4 = \u03c0. We shall see shortly that this embedding is very natural from the point\nof view of string theory, since x is a natural coordinate on the group SL(2, R), which plays\n\na crucial role in defining the complete theory. It is interesting to sketch the behaviour of the\nfunction Gtt = F (x) = (1 \u2212 x2 )/(x + \u03b4)2 . This is done in figure 1. Note that F (x) vanishes at\nx = \u00b11 and so for x = 1 \u2212 \u03c4 where \u03c4 is small, the metric of the (\u03c4, \u03be) space is:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c4\n2\n2\n\u22121\n2\n,\n(9)\nd\u03be\nds = k \u2212(2\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 +\n(1 + \u03b4)2\nwhich is of Misner form, and so the essential features of the Taub\u2013NUT spacetime persist in this\nstringy version of the spacetime. Note that, unlike General Relativity's Taub\u2013NUT solution,\nthere is a genuine curvature singularity in the metric, and it is located at x = \u2212\u03b4. The dilaton\n6\n\n\fF(x)\n\nNUT\n\nTaub\n\nx\n\u2212\u03b4\n\nNUT\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nNUT\n\nFigure 1: The various regions in the stringy Taub\u2013NUT geometry. There are two NUT regions,\ncontaining CTCs, and a Taub region. which is a cosmology. Note that there is a curvature singularity\nin the second NUT region, when x = \u2212\u03b4.\n\ndiverges there, and hence the string theory is strongly coupled at this place, but it is arbitrarily\nfar from the regions of Misner space connecting the Taub and NUT regions, so we will not need\nto worry about this locus for the questions of interest in this paper.\nNote that the (x, t) plane is fibered over a family of S 2 s which have constant radius, as opposed\nto a radius varying with x. This does not mean that we lose key features of the geometry, since\ne.g. in the Taub region, we still have a cosmology in which the universe has S 3 topology, but\nits volume is controlled entirely by the size of the circle fibre (dt \u2212 \u03bb cos \u03b8d\u03c6), which ensures\nthat the universe's volume vanishes at the beginning and the end of the cosmology.\n\nThe constancy of the S 2 s is in fact a feature, not a bug. It allows the geometry to be captured\nin an exact conformal field theory, as we shall recall in the next section. This geometry is the\n\"near\u2013horizon\" limit of a spacetime constructed as confirmation of the statement in ref. [19]\nthat the metric in question is indeed obtainable from the original Taub\u2013NUT metric in a series\nof steps using the symmetries of the heterotic string theory action [63\u201365]. This geometry is,\nin string frame:\n2\n\n2\n\nds = (a +\n\nf22 )\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\nf1\n2\n\u22121\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 2 (dt + (\u03c1 + 1)l cos \u03b8d\u03c6) + f1 dr + (r + l )(d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8d\u03c6 ) , (10)\nf2\n7\n\n\fwhere f1 is as before, \u03c12 \u2265 1 and\nf2 = 1 + (\u03c1 \u2212 1)\n\nMr + l2\n,\nr 2 + l2\n\nand\n\na = (\u03c1 \u2212 1)l\n\nr\u2212M\n.\nr 2 + l2\n\n(11)\n\nThis metric has the full asymptotically flat part of the geometry and connects smoothly onto\nthe throat region, which develops in an \"extremal\" limit (analogous to that taken for charged\nblack holes). Figure 2 shows a cartoon of this. The metric (5) is obtained from it in the extremal\nlimit \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, M \u2192 0, l \u2192 0, where m = \u03c1M and l = \u03c1l are held finite. The limit is taken in\n\nthe neighbourhood of f1 = 0, and \u03c3 is the scaled coordinate parameterizing r in that region.\nThe coordinate t has to be rescaled as well to get matching expressions. The parameters of\n\nmetric (5) are recovered as: \u03bb = l/m and \u03b4 2 = 1 + l2 /M 2 .\n\n\u039b\n\n\u03c3\n\nthroat region\n\nr\nasymptotically\nflat region\n\nFigure 2: A schematic showing the asymptotically flat region connected to the throat region located\nnear the horizon at extremality. In the extremal limit, the typical measure, \u039b of the distance from a\npoint on the outside to a point near the horizon region diverges logarithmically, and the throat region\nis infinitely long. The coordinate \u03c3 is used for the exact throat region in low\u2013energy metric (5), while\nr is the coordinate for the general low energy metric (10).\n\nThe stringy embedding giving rise to the metric (10) (we have not displayed the other fields\nof the solution here) is carried out starting from the metric (1) as follows: (The details are\nin refs. [63\u201365]). First, an O(1, 1) boost (a subgroup of the large group of perturbative non\u2013\ncompact symmetries possessed by the heterotic theory) is used to generate a new solution,\n\n8\n\n\fmixing the t direction with a U(1) gauge direction. This generates a gauge field At , a non\u2013\ntrivial dilaton, and since there is a coupling of t to \u03c6 in the original metric, a gauge field\nA\u03c6 and an anti\u2013symmetric tensor background Bt\u03c6 . So the solution has electric and magnetic\ncharges under a U(1) of the heterotic string, and non\u2013trivial axion and dilaton charge. We\nwill not need the forms of the fields here. It turns out that the dilaton has a behaviour which\nis \"electric\" in its behaviour in a sense inherited from the behaviour of charged dilaton black\nholes: It decreases as one approaches the horizon. Such holes do not support the development\nof throats in the string frame metric, but their \"magnetic\" cousins, where the dilaton has the\nopposite behaviour, do support throats5 . Using the SL(2, R) S\u2013duality of the four dimensional\neffective action of the heterotic string, which combines an electric\u2013magnetic duality with an\ninversion of the axi\u2013dilaton field \u03c4 = a + ie\u2212\u03a6 , a solution with \"magnetic\" character can be\nmade [63, 64], which supports a throat in the string frame metric. This is the solution whose\nmetric we have displayed in equation (10).\nSo in summary, there is an embedding of General Relativity's celebrated Taub\u2013NUT solution\ninto heterotic string theory which preserves all of the interesting features: the NUT regions\ncontaining CTCs, and the Taub region with its Big Bang and Big Crunch cosmology, and\n(crucially) the Misner regions connecting them. There is a throat part of the geometry which\ndecouples from the asymptotically flat region in an extremal limit, but which captures all of\nthe features of the Taub\u2013NUT geometry of interest to us here.\nThe next thing we need to recall is that this throat geometry arises as the low energy limit of\na complete description in terms of a conformal field theory, as presented in ref. [19].\n\n3\n\nExact Conformal Field Theory\n\n3.1\n\nThe Definition\n\nIn ref. [19], the \"heterotic coset model\" technique was presented, and one of the examples of\nthe application of the method was the model in question, from which the low energy metric\nin equation (7) was derived, for x = cosh \u03c3. The other regions that have been presented here\n(making up \u2212\u221e \u2264 x \u2264 0) are easily obtained from the same conformal field theory by choosing\ndifferent coordinate patches in the parent model, as we shall see.\nActions can be written for a large class of conformal field theories obtained as coset models\n5\n\nIn fact, an exact conformal field theory can be written for pure magnetic dilaton black holes in four\ndimensions [69], and it can be realized as a heterotic coset model as well [19].\n\n9\n\n\f[70\u201374], by using gauged WZNW models [75\u201380]. The ungauged model [81,82] has some global\nsymmetry group G which defines a conformal field theory [83\u201385] with an underlying current\nalgebra, and coupling it to gauge fields charged under a subgroup H \u2282 G gives the coset. Such\n\nmodels have been used to generate conformal field theories for many studies in string theory,\nincluding cosmological contexts (see the introduction for some references). It is important\nto note that the vast majority of these models use a particular sort of gauging. The basic\nworld\u2013sheet field is group valued, and we shall denote it as g(z, z\u0304). The full global invariance\nis GL \u00d7 GR , realized as: g(z, z\u0304) \u2192 gL g(z, z\u0304)gR\u22121 , for gL , gR \u2208 G. The sorts of group actions\n\ngauged in most studies are g \u2192 hL gh\u22121\nR , for hL , hR \u2208 H, and it is only a restricted set of\nchoices of the action of hL and hR which allow for the writing of a gauge invariant action.\nThese are the \"anomaly\u2013free\" subgroups, and the typical choice that is made is to correlate the\nleft and right actions so that the choice is essentially left\u2013right symmetric. This also gives a\nsymmetric structure on the world sheet, as appropriate to bosonic strings and to superstrings\nif one considers supersymmetric WZNW models. For these anomaly\u2013free subgroups, a gauge\nextension of the basic WZNW action can be written which is H\u2013invariant, and the resulting\nconformal field theory is well\u2013defined. The supersymmetric models can of course be turned\ninto heterotic string theories too, by simply tensoring with the remaining conformal field theory\nstructures needed to make a left\u2013right asymmetric model.\nThe general heterotic coset model goes beyond this, and exploits the basic fact that the heterotic\nstring is asymmetric in how it is built. The idea is to allow oneself the freedom to choose to gauge\nfar more general subgroups. This might well produce anomalies, but permits one to choose to\nretain certain global symmetries which might be of interest (such as spacetime rotations) and/or\nuse in the conformal field theory. Introducing right\u2013moving fermions to achieve a right\u2013moving\nsupersymmetry is easy to do, and they contribute extra terms to the anomaly, making matters\nworse in general: Their couplings (the effective charges they carry under H) are completely\ndetermined by supersymmetry, so one has no choice. Of course, one does not have a well\u2013\ndefined model if there are anomalies, so ultimately they must be eliminated. This is achieved\nas follows [19]. Note that the left\u2013moving fermions can be introduced with arbitrary couplings\n(charges under H), since there is no requirement of left\u2013moving supersymmetry in the heterotic\n\nstring. The anomaly they contribute comes with the opposite sign to that of the others, since\nthey have the opposite chirality. The requirement that the anomaly cancels can be satisfied,\nsince it just gives a set of algebraic equations to solve for the charges. The resulting model is\na conformal field theory with (0,1) world\u2013sheet supersymmetry, (enhanced to (0, 2) when G/H\nis K\u00e4hler [86\u201388]) naturally adapted to the heterotic string.\n\n10\n\n\fIt is important to note that the types of heterotic models obtained by this method are very\ndifferent from the types of models obtained by gaugings that do not cancel the anomalies against\nthose of the gauge fermions. One way to see the difference is to note that since the anomaly\nis proportional to k, the cancellation equation puts the gauge charge at the same order as the\nmetric. This means that there is a non\u2013trivial modification of the geometry one would read\noff from the WZNW action, traceable to the left\u2013moving fermions. We will explain this more\nshortly.\nBy way of example, we simply present the model relevant to our study here [19]. The group in\nquestion is SL(2, R) \u00d7 SU(2), and the group elements are denoted g1 and g2 respectively. Let\n\nthe levels of the models be denoted k1 and k2 , respectively. We are interested in a U(1)A \u00d7U(1)B\nsubgroup (A and B are just means of distinguishing them) which acts as follows:\n\u001a\ng1 \u2192 e\u01ebA \u03c33 /2 g1 e(\u03b4\u01ebA +\u03bb\u01ebB )\u03c33 /2\nU(1)A \u00d7 U(1)B :\n(12)\ng2 \u2192\ng2 ei\u01ebB \u03c33 /2\nNotice that there is a whole global SU(2)L of the original SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R untouched. This\nis a deliberate choice to give a model with spacetime SU(2) invariance (rotations) in the end.\nWith that, and the other asymmetry introduced by the presence of \u03bb and \u03b4, the gauging is\nvery anomalous. Once right\u2013moving supersymmetry fermions are introduced, the anomalies\nare proportional to \u2212k1 (1 \u2212 \u03b4 2 ) + 2\u03b4 2 from the AA sector, k1 \u03b4\u03bb + 2\u03b4\u03bb from the AB sector, and\nk2 + k1 \u03bb2 + 2(1 + \u03bb2 ) from the BB sector. The k\u2013independent parts come from the fermions.\nNext, four left\u2013moving fermions are introduced. Two are given charges QA,B under U(1)A,B and\nthe other two are given charges PA,B . Their anomalies are \u22122(Q2A + PA2 ), \u22122(QA QB + PA PB ),\nand \u22122(Q2B + PB2 ), respectively, from the various sectors AA, AB, BB. So we can achieve an\nanomaly\u2013free model by asking that:\n\n\u2212 k1 (1 \u2212 \u03b4 2 ) = 2(Q2A + PA2 \u2212 \u03b4 2 )\nk1 \u03b4\u03bb = 2(QA QB + PA PB \u2212 \u03b4\u03bb)\n\nk2 + k1 \u03bb2 = 2(Q2B + PB2 \u2212 (1 + \u03bb2 )) .\n\n(13)\n\nIt is a highly non\u2013trivial check on the consistency of the model to note that in the solution\u2013\ngenerating techniques used to verify the observation made in ref. [19] that our stringy solution (5) can be obtained from the basic Taub\u2013NUT solution (1), the charges in the resulting\nthroat metric turn out to be given in terms of the parameters M, l and \u03c1 in such a way that they\nsatisfy the anomaly equations above, in the large k limit (which is appropriate to low\u2013energy).\nSee ref. [63].\n11\n\n\fThe central charge of this four dimensional model is:\nc=\n\n3k1\n3k2\n+\n,\nk1 \u2212 2 k2 + 2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the \u22122 from gauging is cancelled by the +2 from four bosons on the left and right. We\ncan ask that this be equal to 6, as is appropriate for a four dimensional model, tensoring with\nanother conformal field theory to make up the internal sector, as desired6 . The result is that\nk1 = k2 + 4.\nIn ref. [19], the metric for the throat region was discovered by working in the low energy limit\nwhere k1 and k2 are large, and denoted simply as k. In this paper, we study the case of going\nbeyond this large k (low energy) approximation and derive the geometry which is correct to all\norders in the \u03b1\u2032 \u223c 1/k expansion.\n\n3.2\n\nWriting The Full Action\n\nThe G = SL(2, R) \u00d7 SU(2) WZNW model is given by:\nS(g1 , g2) = \u2212k1 I(g1 ) + k2 I(g2 ) ,\nwhere\n\nwith\n\n1\nI(g) = \u2212\n4\u03c0\n1\n\u0393(g) =\n12\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd2 zTr(g \u22121 \u2202z gg \u22121\u2202z\u0304 g) \u2212 i\u0393(g) ,\n\n(16)\n\nd3 \u03c3\u01ebabc Tr(g \u22121 \u2202a gg \u22121\u2202b gg \u22121\u2202c g) .\n\n(17)\n\n\u03a3\n\nZ\n\n(15)\n\nB\n\nThe group valued fields g1 (z, z\u0304) \u2208 SL(2, R) and g2 (z, z\u0304) \u2208 SU(2) map the world\u2013sheet \u03a3 with\n\ncoordinates (z, z\u0304) into the group SL(2, R) \u00d7 SU(2).

It is therefore hard to work with the model in computing a number of properties.\nIn particular, in working out the effective spacetime fields it is useful to integrate out the gauge\nfields. It is hard to take into account the effects of the successful anomaly cancellation if part\nof them are quantum and part classical. The way around this awkward state of affairs [19] is\n\n13\n\n\fto bosonize the fermions. The anomalies of the fermions then appear as classical anomalies of\nthe action. The bosonized action is:\n(\nZ\n1\nB 2\nB\nA 2\nIB =\nd2 z |\u2202z \u03a62 \u2212 PA AA\nz \u2212 (PB + 1)Az | + |\u2202z \u03a61 \u2212 (QB + \u03bb)Az \u2212 (QA + \u03b4)Az |\n4\u03c0\n\u2212\u03a61 [(QB \u2212 \u03bb)FzBz\u0304 + (QA \u2212 \u03b4)FzAz\u0304 ] \u2212 \u03a62 [(PB \u2212 1)FzBz\u0304 + PA FzAz\u0304 ]\n)\n\nB\nA B\n+[AA\nz\u0304 Az \u2212 Az Az\u0304 ][\u03b4QB \u2212 \u03bbQA \u2212 PA ]\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich under variations:\n\u03b4AA(B)\n= \u2202a \u01ebA(B) ,\na\n\n\u03b4\u03a61 = (QA + \u03b4)\u01ebA + (QB + \u03bb)\u01ebB ,\n\n\u03b4\u03a62 = PA \u01ebA + (PB + 1)\u01ebB ,\n\n(25)\n\nmanifestly reproduces the anomalies presented earlier.\n\n3.3\n\nExtracting the Low Energy Metric\n\nAt this stage, it is possible to proceed to derive the background fields at leading order by\nstarting with the Lagrangian definition given in the previous section and integrating out the\ngauge fields, exploiting the fact that they appear quadratically in the action. As these fields are\nfully quantum fields, this procedure is only going to produce a result which is correct at leading\norder in the 1/k expansion, where k is large. This is because we are using their equations\nof motion to replace them in the action, and neglecting their quantum fluctuations. Before\nturning to how to go beyond that, let us note that there is an important subtlety even in the\nderivation of the leading order metric. This is not an issue for coset models that are not built\nin this particularly heterotic manner, and so is a novelty that cannot be ignored.\nThe coordinates we use for SL(2, R) and SU(2) are:\n\u0012 t /2\n\u0013\n1\ne + (x + 1)1/2 et\u2212 /2 (x \u2212 1)1/2\ng1 = \u221a\n,\n\u2212t /2\n1/2\ne\u2212t+ /2 (x + 1)1/2\n2 e \u2212 (x \u2212 1)\nwhere t\u00b1 = tL \u00b1 tR , and \u2212\u221e \u2264 tR , tL , x \u2264 \u221e, and the Euler angles\n\u0013\n\u0012 i\u03c6 /2\nei\u03c6\u2212 /2 sin 2\u03b8\ne + cos 2\u03b8\n,\ng2 =\n\u2212e\u2212i\u03c6\u2212 /2 sin 2\u03b8 e\u2212i\u03c6+ /2 cos \u03b82\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u00b1 = \u03c6 \u00b1 \u03c8, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0, 0 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 4\u03c0, and 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0. Note that the full range of x is\navailable here, while remaining in SL(2, R). In ref. [19], the range x = cosh \u03c3 \u2265 1 was used.\n14\n\n\fThe larger range reveals the connection to the Taub and the other NUT region. This extension\nis very naturally inherited from the SL(2, R) embedding7 .\nThe gauge we fix to before integrating out the gauge fields is:\ntL = 0 ,\n\n\u03c8 = \u00b1\u03c6 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the sign choice depends on which coordinate patch we investigate, such that + refers\nto the North pole on the S 2 parameterized by (\u03b8, \u03c6) and \u2212 refers to the South pole, and we\n\nwrite tR = t. One can then read off various spacetime fields from the resulting \u03c3\u2013model, by\nexamining terms of the form Cij \u2202z \u03c7i \u2202z\u0304 \u03c7j , where here \u03c7j , is a place holder for any worldsheet\nfield, and j denoted which field is present. When i, j are such that \u03c7i \u03c7j run over the set of fields\nt, x, \u03b8, \u03c6, then the symmetric parts of Cij give a metric we shall call G0\u03bc\u03bd , and the antisymmetric\n\nparts give the antisymmetric tensor potential B\u03bc\u03bd . When i, j are such that \u03c7i is one of the\nbosonized fermions and \u03c7j is one of t, x, \u03b8, \u03c6, the Cij is a spacetime gauge potential, either from\n(1,2)\nthe (1) or the (2) sector: A\u03bc .\nNote that G0\u03bc\u03bd is not the correct spacetime metric at this order. This is a crucial point [19].\nThe anomaly cancellation requirement means that the contribution from the left\u2013movers has a\nsignificant modification to the naive metric. The most efficient way of seeing how it is modified\nis to re\u2013fermionize the bosons, using as many symmetries as one can to help in deducing the\nnormalization of the precise couplings. After some work [19], it transpires that the correct\nmetric (to leading order) is:\nG\u03bc\u03bd = G0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n1 1 1\n[A\u03bc A\u03bd + A2\u03bc A2\u03bd ] ,\n2k\n\nwhere it can be seen that because A \u223c Q and from the anomaly equations (13) we have Q \u223c\n\n(29)\n\u221a\n\nk,\n\nthis gives a non\u2013trivial correction to the metric one reads off naively. This is the clearest sign\nthat these heterotic coset models are quite different from coset models that have commonly\nbeen used to make heterotic string backgrounds by tensoring together ordinary cosets. In those\ncases, typically A \u223c Q \u223c 1 and so at large k, the correction is negligible.\n\nThis sets the scene for what we will have to do when we have constructed the exact effective \u03c3\u2013\nmodel. We will again need to correct the naive metric in a way which generalizes equation (29),\nin order to get the right spacetime metric.\n7\n\nSee ref. [32] for a discussion of how an SL(2, R) structure also provides a natural extension for the discussion\nof wavefunctions in related spacetimes.\n\n15\n\n\f3.4\n\nThe Exact Effective Action\n\nIn the previous section, we treated the gauge fields as classical fields, substituting their on\u2013\nshell behaviour into the action to derive the effective \u03c3\u2013model action for the rest of the fields\nand ignoring the effects of quantum fluctuations arising at subleading order in the large k\nexpansion. To include all of the physics and derive a result valid at any order in k, we need\nto do better than this. For ordinary coset models, this sort of thing has been achieved before,\nusing a number of methods. To our knowledge, this was first done in ref. [89] in the context\nof the SL(2, R)/U(1) coset model studied as a model of a two\u2013dimensional black hole [90].\nThe exact metric and dilaton were written down by appealing to a group theoretic argument,\nwriting the exact expressions for the quadratic Casimirs for G and for H, in terms of the target\nspace (G/H) fields, and then equating their difference to the Laplacian for the propagation of a\nmassless field (the tachyon) in the background. The proposed metric and dilaton were verified\nat higher orders by explicit calculation in ref. [91, 92], and the argument was generalized and\napplied to a number of other models in a series of papers [93, 94]. An elegant alternative\nmethod was developed in refs. [95,96], and is the one we adapt for use here. We must extend it\nto work for the heterotic coset models, since although heterotic backgrounds are considered in\nsome of those works, they are of the mildly heterotic type which are essentially similar to the\nsuperstring models: an asymmetric arrangement of fermions is merely tensored in as dressing.\nSince there will be a fair amount of messy computation in what follows, we state the key ideas\nin what follows: It is known [95, 97, 98] that the exact effective action for the WZNW model\ndefined in ref.(16) is extremely simple to write down. One takes the form of the basic action\nat level k, kI(g), where g is a quantum field, and one writes for the full quantum effective\naction (k \u2212 cG )I(g), where now g should be taken as a classical field, and cG is the dual\nCoxeter number of the group G. This is particularly simple since k only enters the action as\nan overall multiplicative factor, which then gets shifted. The key observation of refs. [95, 96] is\nthat this can be applied to a gauged WZNW model as well, by exploiting the fact that if one\n\u22121\nwrites Az = \u2202z hz h\u22121\nz and Az\u0304 = \u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 hz\u0304 , the action can be written as the sum of two formally\ndecoupled WZNW models, one for the field g \u2032 = h\u22121\nz\u0304 ghz at level k and the other for the field\n\u22121\n\u2032\nh = hz\u0304 hz at level 2cH \u2212 k. To write the exact effective action, one shifts the levels in each\naction: k \u2192 k \u2212 cG and 2cH \u2212 k \u2192 2cH \u2212 k \u2212 cH = cH \u2212 k, and treats the fields as classical.\n\nTransforming back to the original variables, one gets the original gauged WZNW model with\nits level shifted according to k \u2192 k \u2212 cG , together with a set of new terms for Az , Az\u0304 which\n\nare proportional to cH \u2212 cG , and have no k dependence. Because there is no multiplicative\nfactor of k in these new terms, it is easy to see that the large k contribution to the result of\n16\n\n\fintegrating out the gauge fields will be the same as before. For results exact in k, there will be\na family of new contributions to the \u03c3\u2013model couplings upon integrating out the gauge fields.\nIn this effective action, they are to be treated as classical fields now and so once the integration\nis done, there are no further contributions from quantum fluctuations to take into account.\nThe metrics derived using this method are the same as those constructed using the algebraic\napproach, which is a useful consistency check [95, 96].\nNote that the new pieces in the effective action are non\u2013local in the fields Az , Az\u0304 (although local\nin the hz , hz\u0304 ). This difficulty does not present a problem for the purposes of reading off the\nspacetime fields, since it is enough to work in the zero\u2013mode sector of the string to capture this\ninformation. This amounts to dropping all derivatives with respect to \u03c3 on the world\u2013sheet and\nworking with the reduced \"point\u2013particle\" Lagrangian for that aspect of the computation [96].\nLet us turn to the model in question. Here, we exploit the fact [19, 66, 67] that our heterotic\ncoset model, in its bosonized form (where all the anomalies are classical) can be thought of as\nan asymmetrically gauged WZNW model for G/H supplemented by another asymmetrically\ngauged WZNW model for SO(dim G \u2212 dim H)/H, representing the fermions. We should be\nable to carry out a similar set of changes of variables to write the whole model as a set of\ndecoupled WZNW models, transform to the effective action, and then rewrite it back in the\noriginal variables to see what new terms the effective action supplies us with. Then we have to\nintegrate out the gauge fields and -crucially- correctly re\u2013fermionize the bosons to read off\nthe spacetime fields. This is the subject of the next subsection. The reader wishing to skip to\nthe result can pick up the story again at the beginning of subsection 3.7.\n\n3.5\n\nComputation of the Exact Effective Action\n\nAs noted above, the fermions can also be represented as a gauged WZNW model based on the\ncoset SO(D)/H, with D = dim G \u2212 dim H = 6 \u2212 2 = 4. Doing this, the complete classical\naction can be written as:\n\nS = \u2212k1 I(g1 ) + k2 I(g2 ) + I(gf ) ,\nwith g1 \u2208 SL(2, R), g2 \u2208 SU(2), and gf \u2208 SO(4).

These are the gauge fields, which take values in the\nLie algebra of H. With fL \u2208 HL , fR \u2208 HR , the gauge transformation is written\ng \u2192 fL gfR\u22121 .\nThe ta,L are left generators, and ta,R are\nnotation above, we can write\n\uf8eb (1)\nta\na\uf8ec\nA=A \uf8ed 0\n0\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(33)\n\nright generators of H.

However, there is a unique extension\nsuch that the anomalies do not depend on g, but only on gauge fields [99]. This extension has\nbeen used in the expression above.\n3.5.1\n\nA Change of variables\n\nBy the change of variables\n\u22121\nAz,L = \u2212\u2202z hz h\u22121\nz , Az,R = \u2212\u2202z h\u0303z h\u0303z ,\n\u22121\nAz\u0304,L = \u2212\u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 hz\u0304 , Az\u0304,R = \u2212\u2202z\u0304 h\u0303z\u0304 h\u0303z\u0304\u22121 ,\n\nh, h\u0303 \u2208 H ,\n\n(37)\n\nwe find\n2\nS1 (g, h) =\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nn\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\nd2zTr \u2212 \u2202z gg \u22121\u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 h\u22121\nz\u0304 + g \u2202z\u0304 g\u2202z h\u0303z h\u0303z \u2212 \u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 hz\u0304 g\u2202z h\u0303z h\u0303z g\no\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n+ (\u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 h\u22121\n\u2202\nh\nh\n+\n\u2202\nh\u0303\nh\u0303\n\u2202\nh\u0303\nh\u0303\n)\n.\nz\nz\nz\u0304\nz\u0304\nz\nz\nz\u0304\nz\nz\u0304\nz\n2\n18\n\n(38)\n\n\fThe Polyakov-Wiegmann identity [82] leads to the identities:\n\u22121\nI(h\u22121\nz\u0304 g h\u0303z ) =I(g) + I(hz\u0304 ) + I(h\u0303z )\nZ\nh\ni\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nd2zTr \u2212\u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 hz\u0304\u22121 \u2202z gg \u22121 \u2212 \u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 hz\u0304\u22121 g\u2202z h\u0303z h\u0303\u22121\ng\n+\ng\n\u2202\ng\u2202\nh\u0303\nh\u0303\n,\n+\nz\u0304\nz z z\nz\n4\u03c0\nZ\ni\nh\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\nI(hz\u0304 hz ) =I(hz\u0304 ) + I(hz ) +\nd zTr \u2212\u2202z\u0304 hz\u0304 hz\u0304 \u2202z hz hz ,\n4\u03c0\nZ\nh\ni\n2\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\nI(h\u0303\u22121\nh\u0303\n)\n=I(\nh\u0303\n)\n+\nI(\nh\u0303\n)\n+\nd\nzTr\n\u2212\u2202\nh\u0303\nh\u0303\n\u2202\nh\u0303\nh\u0303\n.\n(39)\nz\nz\nz\u0304 z\u0304 z\u0304\nz z z\nz\u0304\nz\u0304\n4\u03c0\n\nUsing these, the classical action can be written as8 :\ni 1 i\n1 h \u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nS1 = \u2212I(g) + I(hz\u0304 g h\u0303z ) \u2212 I(hz\u0304 hz ) + I(h\u0303z\u0304 h\u0303z ) \u2212 C ,\n2\n2\n\u22121\n\u22121\nwhere C \u2261 I(hz\u0304 ) \u2212 I(h\u0303z\u0304 ) \u2212 I(hz ) + I(h\u0303z ) .\n\nThe term C is not manifestly gauge invariant, but the others are.

This is (almost) the form required for re\u2013fermionization, and we can read off the\nmetric from the first term. Before refermionisation, we must rescale the \u03a6s in the action (68)\n \u0304 j becomes \u03b4ij \u2202 \u03a6\ne i \u2202 \u0304\u03a6\ne j .

The \u00b11 can be gauged away by e.g., a shift of t to match the form given in section 1. The\ndilaton is generated by the effects of two Jacobians. One comes from the determinant, det A,\n24\n\n\farising from integrating out the gauge fields, but there is another contribution coming from the\ne That Jacobian is:\nchange of variables from \u03a6 to \u03a6.\n\u2202\u03a6\n= detU = (detR)\u22121/2 .\ne\n\u2202\u03a6\n\nThis results in [100]:\n\n1\n\n(74)\n\n1\n\ne2\u03a6 = (det A)\u2212 2 (det R)\u2212 2 ,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere the determinants can be written as follows.

The expressions for\nthe exact fields B\u03bc\u03bd , Ai\u03bc are somewhat involved, but straightforward to read off. We will not\nlist them here, as we will not need them in what follows.\nAs a useful check on our procedure, it is worth noting that the large k limit gives the expressions\noriginally written in ref. [19]. In this limit, we get D \u2192 (\u03b4 + x)2 , and the metric becomes that\ngiven in equation (7), and the dilaton becomes:\n1\n\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a60 \u2192 \u2212 ln(x + \u03b4) .\n2\n\n3.7\n\n(80)\n\nProperties of the Exact Metric\n\nAs already stated in the previous section, the final result for the exact spacetime metric is (after\na trivial shift in t):\n\u0012\n\ndx2\n+ F (x)(dt \u2212 \u03bb cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\nds = (k \u2212 2)\nx2 \u2212 1\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nx2 \u2212 1\n4\n(x + \u03b4)2\nwhere F (x) = \u2212\n.\n=\u2212\n\u2212\nD(x)\nx2 \u2212 1\nk+2\n2\n\n25\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n(81)\n\n\fThis is a pleasingly simple form to result from such an involved computation. In fact, its\nrelation to the leading order result is reminiscent in form to the relation between the leading\norder and exact results for the black hole SL(2, R)/U(1) model [89, 90].\nIt is interesting to sketch the behaviour of Gtt = F (x), as it contains the answer to our original\nquestions about the fate of the Taub and NUT regions of the spacetime once the contributions\nof the stringy physics are included.

The first is that the Taub and NUT regions, although modified\nsomewhat, survive to all orders. The second is that the local structure of the chronology\nhorizons separating these regions is completely unaffected by the stringy corrections! F (x) still\nvanishes at x = \u00b11 and furthermore for x = 1 \u2212 \u03c4 where \u03c4 is small, the metric of the (\u03c4, \u03be)\nspace (the space over each point of the S 2 ) becomes:\n\u0012\n2\nds = (k \u2212 2) \u2212(2\u03c4 )\u22121 d\u03c4 2 +\nwhich is again of Misner form.\n26\n\n2\u03c4\nd\u03be 2\n(1 + \u03b4)2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(82)\n\n\fNotice that the singularity we observed in F (x) (and the spacetime) has now split into two.\nRecalling the definition of D(x) given in equation (73), we can write the Ricci scalar as:\ni\nh\n1\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n2\n\u2032 2\n2 2\n\u2032\n,\nR=\u2212\n2D(x\n\u2212\n1)D\n\u2212\n3(x\n\u2212\n1)\n(D\n)\n+\n\u03bb\n(x\n\u2212\n1)D\n+\n6xDD\n(83)\n2(k \u2212 2)D 2\n\n(where a prime means d/dx).

Such a region was noticed in ref. [101]\nin the context of the exact metric for the SL(2, R)/U(1) coset giving the two dimensional\nblack hole. This region remains entirely within the second NUT region, however, and never\napproaches the Misner horizons. Its size goes as 1/(k \u2212 2). The model only seems to make\n\nsense for k > 2, of course, and it interesting to note that the limiting behaviour of this metric\nas k \u2192 2+ is that the Euclidean region grows until it fills the entire left hand side of the sketch\n(see figure 4), with one singularity at x = \u2212(\u03b4 2 + 1)/(2\u03b4), and the other, when last seen, was\nmoving off to x = \u2212\u221e.\n\nF(x)\n\nEuclidean\nregion\n\nTaub\n\nNUT\n\nx\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b4+1\n2\u03b4\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nNUT\n\nFigure 4: The various regions in the stringy Taub\u2013NUT geometry for the smallest value of k possible.

Closed time\u2013like curves are\nvery common in General Relativity, but the theory is silent about their physical role in a\ncomplete theory of gravity. They can appear after a cosmology passes through a certain type\nof spacelike \"Big Crunch\" singularity, and it is natural to wonder if the full theory somehow\nmodifies the geometry in a way which obstructs this process of formation, realizing the so\u2013\ncalled chronology protection conjecture [6]. The model upon which a great deal of the study\nwithin General Relativity has been focused is the Taub\u2013NUT spacetime (or local parts of it).\nQuite satisfyingly, this is precisely the model that we study here, furthering earlier work which\nshowed how to embed it into string theory in a way which allows a complete definition in terms\nof conformal field theory.\nThe study of the model we performed here was to go beyond the low energy truncation and\ncompute the all orders in \u03b1\u2032 geometry, thereby including the effects of the entire string spectrum\non the background. Our embedding (into heterotic string theory) was chosen so as to permit\nsuch corrections to occur, at least in principle. Somewhat surprisingly (perhaps) we found that\nthe key features of the Taub\u2013NUT geometry persist to all orders. This includes the fact that\nthe volume of the universe in the Taub cosmology vanishes as a circle shrinks to zero size, at the\njunction (described by Misner space) where the CTCs first appear. There is no disconnection\nof the Taub region from the NUT regions containing the CTCs, to all orders in \u03b1\u2032 . Note that\nthe strength of the string coupling near the junctions is not particularly remarkable, and so\nan appeal to severe corrections purely due to string loops may not help modify the geometry\nfurther.\nWe have therefore ruled out a large class of possible modification to the geometry which could\nhave destroyed the chronology horizons and prevented the formation of the CTC regions (from\nthe point of view of someonestarting in the cosmological Taub region). As remarked upon in\nthe introduction, there is still the possibility that there is an instability of the full geometry to\nbackreaction by probe particles or strings. A large class of such effects are likely missed by our\nall orders computation of the metric. There are studies of Misner space in various dimensions\n(in its orbifold representations) that signal such an instability [21, 23, 24], and the fate of the\nchronology horizons embedded in our geometry should be examined in the light of those studies.\nThe nature of the spacetime in which they are embedded is important, however, and so it seems\nthat the relevant geometry to study such backreaction effects is the fully corrected geometry\n28\n\n\fwe have derived here, since it takes into account the full \u03b1\u2032 effects.\nQuantum effects may well be important even though the string coupling is not strong at the\nchronology horizons, and even if there are no (as we have seen here) modifications due to\n\u03b1\u2032 corrections. Radically new physics can happen if there are the right sort of special (for\nexample, massless) states arising in the theory there together with (crucially) certain types of\nnew physics. Strings wrapped on the t\u2013circle are candidate such states. Following these states\ncould shed new light on the validity of the geometry if they are accompanied by the appropriate\nphysics, such as in the mechanism of ref. [102]. Such probe heterotic strings are hard to study\nin the sigma model approach, but it would be interesting to undergo such an investigation. The\nstudy of probes directly in the full conformal field theory (i.e., without direct reference to the\ngeometry) may well be the most efficient way to proceed.\nAnother (less often considered) possibility is that the result of this paper is a sign that the\ntheory is telling us that it is perfectly well\u2013defined in this geometry. The conformal field theory\nis (at face value) well\u2013defined, and there are no obvious signs of a pathology. Perhaps string\ntheory is able to make sense of all of the features of Taub\u2013NUT. For example, the shrinking\nof the spatial circle away to zero size at the Big Bang or Big Crunch might not produce a\npathology of the conformal field theory even through there might be massless states appearing\nfrom wrapped heterotic strings. They might simply be incorporated into the physics in a way\nthat does not invalidate the geometry: The physics, as defined by the world\u2013sheet model, would\nthen carry on perfectly sensibly through that region. This would mean that would be another\ngeometry that a dual heterotic string sees which is perfectly smooth through this region. It\nwould be interesting to construct this geometry9 .\nIn this scenario, if we accept that the conformal field theory is telling us that the stringy physics\nis well behaved as it goes through from the Taub region to the NUT region, we have to face the\npossibility that the CTCs contained in the NUT regions might well be acceptable, and part of\nthe full physics as well.\nWhile it is perhaps too early to conclude this with certainty, it is worth noting that most\nobjections that are raised about physics with CTCs are usually ones based on paradoxes arrived\nat using macroscopic and manifestly classical reasoning, or reasoning based on our very limited\nunderstanding of quantum theory outside of situations where there is an asymptotic spacetime\n9\n\nThe right\u2013handed world\u2013sheet parity flip which generates a dual geometry is no longer achievable by axial\u2013\nvector duality as in simpler cases such as the SL(2, R)/U (1) black hole [89,103]. It only works for \u03b4 = \u00b11, \u03bb = 0.\nHere, it is natural to explore whether \u03b4 \u2192 \u2212\u03b4 combined with other actions might generate it, but a fibre\u2013wise\nduality rather like that which relates [104, 105] an NS5\u2013brane to an ALE space might be more appropriate.\n\n29\n\n\fregion to which we make reference. Some CTCs fall outside of those realms, opening up new\npossibilities. We must recall that time, just like space, is supposed to arrive in our physics\nas an approximate object, having a more fundamental quantum mechanical description in our\ntheory of quantum gravity. The ubiquity of CTCs in theories of gravity might be a sign that\n(appropriately attended to) they are no more harmful than closed spatial circles. Rather than\ntry to discard CTCs, we might also keep in mind the possibility that they might play a natural\nrole in the full theory, when we properly include quantum mechanics. Here, we saw them\nremain naturally adjoined to a toy cosmology, surviving all \u03b1\u2032 corrections. This is just the sort\nof scenario where CTCs might play a role in Nature: A natural way to render meaningless the\nusual questions about the lifetime of the universe prior to the \"Big Bang\" is to have the Big\nBang phase adjoined to a region with CTCs10 . This is an amusing alternative to the usual\nscenarios, and may be naturally realized within string theory, or its fully non\u2013perturbative\nsuccessor.\n\nAcknowledgments\nHGS is supported by the Research Council of Norway, and by an ORS award at Durham.
