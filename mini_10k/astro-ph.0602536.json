Recent radio polarization observations have revealed a plethora of unexpected features in the polarized Galactic radio background\nthat arise from propagation effects in the random (turbulent) interstellar medium. The canals are especially striking among them, a random\nnetwork of very dark, narrow regions clearly visible in many directions\nagainst a bright polarized Galactic synchrotron background.

This opens studies of magnetized interstellar turbulence to new\nmethods of analysis, such as contour statistics and related techniques\nof computational geometry and topology. In particular, we can hope\nto measure such elusive quantities as the Taylor microscale and the\neffective magnetic Reynolds number of interstellar MHD turbulence.\n\n1\n\nThe promise and pitfalls of radio polarization\n\nHigh-resolution maps of the Milky Way synchrotron emission show a complex,\nirregular system of polarized and depolarized structures (Wieringa et al. 1993,\nUyan\u0131ker et al. 1998b, Duncan et al. 1999, Gray et al. 1999, Haverkorn et al. 2000,\nGaensler et al. 2001, Wolleben et al. 2006). Many polarized structures can be\nattributed to objects in the interstellar medium (ISM), such as supernova remnants and shock fronts. These objects are usually bright in total intensity as well.\n1 School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1\n7RU, U.K; e-mail: andrew.fletcher@ncl.ac.uk (AF) and anvar.shukurov@ncl.ac.uk (AS)\n\nc EDP Sciences 2018\nDOI: (will be inserted later)\n\n\f2\n\nTitle : will be set by the publisher\n\nFig. 1: A 24\u25e6 \u00d7 9\u25e6 section of the 1.4 GHz Effelsberg Medium Latitude Survey centred at (l, b) = (162\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) (Reich et al. 2004). Top: total intensity, with large-scale\nstructure added from Dwingeloo data. Middle: polarized intensity, also including\nthe Dwingeloo large-scale structure. Bottom: polarized intensity observed with\nthe Effelsberg telescope with large scale structure missing. Note the strong difference between the (preliminary) absolutely calibrated polarized intensity map\n(middle) and the map with artificial base-levels (bottom).\n\nHowever extended, diffuse polarized emission is also rich in structure which most\nplausibly arises from propagation effects as the radiation passes through the ran-\n\n\fA. Fletcher & A. Shukurov: Depolarization canals\n\n3\n\ndom ISM. As illustrated in Fig. 1, much of this structure is not mirrored in the\ntotal synchrotron intensity so the structure in polarization is not primarily caused\nby variations in emissivity. At low frequencies, the cloudy appearance of polarized intensity maps differs between adjacent, narrow frequency bands (Haverkorn\net al. 2003) strongly suggesting that the polarization varies with wavelength and\nso a connection with Faraday rotation is plausible. Random fluctuations in the\nmagnetized ISM - caused by its turbulent flows, for example - leave their fingerprint in the random appearance of polarized intensity maps. If a connection\ncan be established between measurable properties of the radio maps to the physics\nof the ISM, a powerful new source of information about the dynamic state of the\ninterstellar plasma will become available, particularly its little studied magnetic\nproperties. Similarly, a reliable separation of the Milky Way synchrotron polarized foreground from cosmological signals, either through the creation of templates\nfrom low-frequency data or through statistical analysis, requires a thorough understanding of the origins of structure in the diffuse polarized emission. In the\ncontext of cosmological studies, the effects of the ISM on the polarized emission\npropagating through it are especially important.\nOne of the most striking features of the maps is the twisting network of narrow,\ndark canals running through regions of bright polarized intensity, clearly visible\nin Fig. 1 at 1.4 GHz and common in other maps at this frequency (Uyan\u0131ker et al.\n1998b, Gaensler et al. 2001) and longer wavelengths (Haverkorn et al. 2000). The\nobserved canals have the following properties:\n1. the observed polarized intensity falls to zero, because the polarization angle\nchanges by 90\u25e6 across the canal;\n2. a canal is one telescope beam wide;\n3. a canal passes through a region of significant polarized intensity;\n4. the canal is not related to any obvious structure in the total intensity.\nCare in interpreting the observations is especially important in the case of\npolarized emission: interferometer observations miss emission at large scales (determined by their shortest baseline), and single-dish surveys often have arbitrarily\nset base-levels around their edges. Correcting for the missing large-scale structure\ninvolves adding a smoothly varying signal to the Stokes parameters. In the case\nof total intensity (Stokes I) the consequences are easily predictable. However,\nthe Stokes parameters Q and U are not positive definite and therefore algebraic\naddition of a smooth component can create and/or remove zeros in either. Hence\nminima in polarized intensity (Q2 + U 2 )1/2 can become maxima and vice versa.\nThe effect of absolute calibration on the polarization angle \u03a8 = 12 arctan (U/Q)\ncan be equally counter-intuitive. Reich et al. (2004) clearly identify and discuss\nthese problems. The dramatic effect the missing data can have on the appearance\nof the polarization pattern can be seen by comparing the bottom two panels of\nFig. 1. It is clear that unless statistical parameters can be identified that are\nindependent of the Q and U intensity values, polarization surveys should be tied\n\n\f4\n\nTitle : will be set by the publisher\n\nto an absolutely calibrated reference frame (Uyan\u0131ker et al. 1998a, Reich et al.\n2004). The recent absolutely calibrated all-sky survey at 1.4 GHz by Wolleben et\nal. (2006) will be a mine of useful information for polarization studies. Haverkorn\net al. (2004) argue that if fluctuations in Faraday rotation measure are sufficiently\nstrong and of a small scale, the resulting structure in Q and U can be of such\na small scale that the missing short spacings will not cause a problem. In other\nwords, Q and U may have no large scale structure; this can easily happen at metre\nwavelengths.\nTwo theories accounting for the origin of the canals have been proposed: one invokes strong plane-of-sky gradients or discontinuities in Faraday rotation measure\nin a foreground screen between the emitting region and the observer (Haverkorn\net al. 2000, 2004; Haverkorn & Heitsch 2004) and the other proposes differential\nFaraday rotation along the line-of-sight through the emitting layer (Beck 1999,\nShukurov & Berkhuijsen 2003).\nIn this review we summarize recent work on the interpretation of depolarized\ncanals and provide a more detailed explanation of some analytic results than is\navailable in the readily accessible literature. After introducing basic equations and\ndefining our notation in Section 2, we describe the effects of differential Faraday\nrotation and Faraday screens, demonstrate how canals are formed by the two proposed mechanisms and discuss how observable quantities behave in the vicinity of\na canal in each case. Then in Section 3 we turn to the interpretation of the properties of the canals in terms of the physical state of the ISM. In Section 3.1 the case\nof differential Faraday rotation is discussed in the context of the statistical properties of contours of a random field and we show how canals of this type can yield\ninformation about the smallest scales of ISM turbulence. Similar techniques can\nbe applied to canals produced by Faraday screens, and more generally to contours\nof any randomly distributed observable quantity. Section 2.2 demonstrates that\ntrue discontinuities in Faraday rotation are required if a foreground screen is to\nproduce canals similar to those observed. In the case that these discontinuities are\nshock fronts originating from supernovae, we show in Section 3.2 how the distance\nbetween canals is related to the separation of shock fronts.\n\n2\n\nThe complex polarization, Stokes parameters and depolarization\n\nThe complex polarization is commonly written as\nR\nW (r)\u01eb(r) exp [2i\u03c8(r)] dV\nR\n,\nP = p0 V\nV W (r)\u01eb(r) dV\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere p0 \u2243 0.7 is the maximum degree of polarization for synchrotron emission\n(a function of the spectral index), W is the beam profile around a given position\nin the sky, \u01eb is the synchrotron emissivity, and \u03c8 is the local polarization angle.\nThe integrals are taken over the volume of the beam cylinder and r = (x, y, z)\nspecifies a location with respect to the sky plane (x, y) and the line of sight, z.\nThe modulus and argument of P are the observed degree of polarization p and\n\n\fA.

The Faraday depth, at a position\n(x, y) in the plane of the sky, is defined as,\nZ \u221e\n2\nF (x, y) = \u03c6(\u2212\u221e) = K\u03bb\nne (z)Bz (z) dz .\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand \u03c6(z) is known as the Faraday depth to a position z (cf. Eilek 1989). F and\n\u03c6(z) are convenient variables to work with; \u03c6(z) gives the change in polarization\nangle of a photon of wavelength \u03bb passing through the region z < z \u2032 < \u221e, and\nF is the maximum amount of Faraday rotation in a given direction in the sky.\nNote that F/\u03bb2 can differ strongly from the observed Faraday rotation measure\nRM = d\u03c8/d\u03bb2 . For example, RM = F/2\u03bb2 when emission and rotation occur\ntogether in a uniform slab (see below). However, RM = F/\u03bb2 for a layer that only\nrotates - a Faraday screen. A more comprehensive discussion of depolarization\nand the effects of Faraday rotation can be found in, e.g., Burn (1966) and Sokoloff\net al. (1998).\nObservations of linearly polarized emission measure the Stokes parameters I,\nQ, U and these are related to P, p and \u03a8:\np\n\u0014\n\u0015\nU\nQ2 + U 2\nQ + iU\n1\n1\n, p=\n, \u03a8 = 2 Arctan \u2212 2 \u03c0(signQ \u2212 1)signU\nP=\nI\nI\nQ\n(2.5)\nwhere |Arctan x| < \u03c0/2 denotes the principal value; the above form of \u03a8 allows\nfor a consistent choice of the branch of arctan for any combination of signs of Q\nand U , so that \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03a8 \u2264 \u03c0/2.\n\n2.1\n\nDifferential Faraday rotation\n\nIf linearly polarized emission undergoes Faraday rotation, the photons originating\nat different positions along a single line of sight will suffer different rotations of\n\n\f6\n\nTitle : will be set by the publisher\n\nFig. 2: Diagram showing how canals are formed by differential Faraday rotation.\nThe observer is on the right and x is oriented perpendicular to their line of sight;\neach horizontal strip represents one telescope beam. The Faraday depth varies in\nthe plane of the sky (with x) as shown with thick solid line; the intrinsic polarization angle is uniform (vertical double arrows on the left). Emission generated\non the x-axis cancels the emission generated in a layer where the former is rotated by \u03c0/2, i.e., where F (x) = \u03c0/2. Layers whose emissions mutually cancel are\nindicated by perpendicularly hatched boxes. Only the emission from unshaded\nlayers reaches the observer. The arrows on the right show the observed polarization plane which has been Faraday rotated in layers to the right of the visible\n(unshaded) layer to give the polarization angle \u03a8 in the range indicated. Note\nthat layers to the right of the 'source' (an unshaded layer) act as a Faraday screen,\nand so the rotation angle is equal to F . The canals occur where the polarized\nemission is fully cancelled (regions labelled B). The emission observed at values\nof F (x) slightly smaller than n\u03c0 (regions A) and slightly larger than n\u03c0 (regions\nC) originates in different layers. The difference in F (x) between regions A and\nC is \u03c0/2. Therefore, emission from region A is rotated by \u03c0/2 before reaching\nthe observer, whereas emission from region C is rotated only slightly. Thus, the\npolarization angles observed on the two sides of a canal differ by \u03c0/2. A canal\nthat occurs when F (x) = n\u03c0 with n = 1 is shown near the top, and with n = 2,\nnear the bottom.

So even if all the photons are emitted with the same\npolarization plane, and the amount of Faraday rotation per unit path length is\nconstant, the emerging radiation will comprise a mixture of polarization angles\nand the resulting degree of polarization will be reduced. This process is called differential Faraday rotation (Fig. 2); the depolarizing effect is wavelength-dependent\nbut occurs even for infinitely small telescope beams.\nAlthough the effect appears rather simple to understand, one can discover unexpected subtleties from simple mathematical analysis. Consider a slab extending\nbetween \u2212h < z < h along the line of sight, with constant synchrotron emissivity, \u01eb = const, and uniform magneto-ionic medium, ne Bz = const, throughout as\nshown in Fig. 3(a). The telescope beam is assumed to be infinitely narrow for\nsimplicity, i.e. W is a \u03b4-function in x, y; this makes trivial integration in the sky\nplane in Eq. (2.1).

In each panel, the canal occurs at x = Xc = 0.5 where\nQ = U = 0. In Panel (a), the beam is infinitely narrow and the Faraday depth\nvaries linearly with x smoothly passing through F = \u03c0 at x = 0.5. For the Faraday screen, the beam is a Gaussian of FWHM D = 0.2, with the Faraday depth\nchanging discontinuously by \u2206F = 21 \u03c0 at x = 0.5. The Stokes parameters Q and\nU were obtained from Eqs. (2.1)\u2013(2.5) for the respective configurations shown in\nFig. 3 with \u01eb, ne Bz and \u03c80 uniform along the line of sight.\n\ncanals, it is useful to rewrite this with the help of Eqs.

If F is a continuous\nfunction of position with well-behaved contours, canals will develop on the contours\nof F where |F | = n\u03c0. Therefore, for a canal produced by differential rotation we\nknow the magnitude of the Faraday depth along the canal (up to an integer factor\nn). Techniques for retrieving further information about the physical state of the\nISM from the statistical properties of these contours is discussed in Section 3.1.\nWe are free to measure the polarization angle from a line perpendicular to the\ntransvese magnetic field near the canal; then \u03c80 = 0. Equations (2.9) and (2.10)\n\n\fA. Fletcher & A. Shukurov: Depolarization canals\n\n9\n\nshow that in this reference frame\nQ \u221d sin F cos F ,\n\nU \u221d sin2 F .\n\nWhen F (x) passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0, both Q and U vanish to\nproduce a canal, but Q will change sign across the canal and U will not. In other\nwords, there is always a reference frame in the sky plane such that one of the\nStokes parameters changes sign, but the other does not across a canal produced\nby differential Faraday rotation. This behaviour is illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and we\nwill see in Section 2.2 that this does not occur in the case of canals formed in a\nFaraday screen as illustrated in Fig. 4(b).\nFor the signs of Q and U shown in Fig. 4(a), \u03a8 is in the second quadrant to the\nleft of the canal and in the first quadrant on the right of it. As Q \u2192 0 and U \u2192 0\nfor x \u2192 Xc , where Xc is the position of the canal, we have \u03a8 = \u2212\u03c0/2 for x = Xc \u22120\nbut \u03a8 = \u03c0/2 for x = Xc + 0 - see also Eq. (2.5). Thus the polarization angle\nchanges discontinuously across the canal although the magneto-ionic medium is\nperfectly continuous. In particular, RM has the same values on both sides of a\ncanal (but is undefined at it). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the jump of the polarization\nangle in a continuous medium occurs because the polarized photons detected on\nthe either side of the canal originate at different depths in the source and therefore\nhave experienced different amounts of Faraday rotation.\nThe discussion above refers to the case of an infinitely narrow telescope beam;\nthese canals are infinitely narrow curves in the sky plane. The effect of a finite\nbeam width is twofold. Firstly, the canals in observed maps will be one beam\nwide, as the telescope combines emission from either side of the contour where\n|F | = n\u03c0. Secondly, the canals will gradually fill up with polarized emission as\nthe resolution coarsens, so that asymmetry of the magneto-ionic medium within\nthe beam becomes noticeable.\nCanals are also filled up if the synchrotron emissivity varies along the line of\nsight provided this variation is not compensated by a variation in Faraday rotation.\nIt can be shown, in particular, that a double-layered source where synchrotron\nintensities produced in each layer are I1 and I2 , with |I1 \u2212 I2 |/I1 = \u03b5, and F = n\u03c0,\nwill produce a partially filled canal with the fractional polarization p/p0 \u2243 \u03b5/\u03c0,\nvalid for \u03b5 \u226a 1, i.e., for weak inhomogeneity. This effect can explain why the\nobserved canals are not all closed curves as might be expected of contours of a\ncontinuous function.\nTangled magnetic fields and fluctuations of the electron number density can\nproduce additional depolarization known as internal Faraday dispersion, characterized by the standard deviation of the Faraday depth, \u03c3F . This effect also fills up\na canal, so that the minimum fractional polarization is p/p0 \u2243 \u03c3F2 /\u03c0 for \u03c3F2 \u226a \u03c0.\nThe above two effects are discussed by Fletcher & Shukurov (in preparation).\nJoint action of various depolarization effects can produce counter-intuitive effects. For example, Sokoloff et al. (1998, their Sect. 6.2 and Fig. 5 in Erratum)\nshow that internal Faraday dispersion combined with differential Faraday rotation\ncan lead to a jump of 90\u25e6 in polarization angle whilst the degree of polarization\nvaries smoothly and p differs from zero (if observed with infinitely narrow beam);\n\n\f10\n\nTitle : will be set by the publisher\n\nFig. 5: Sketch showing the variation of Faraday depth F across the sky, here along\nx. There is a constant gradient of F in the range x0 < x < x0 + \u2206x, and the\ntelescope beam has a width D.\n\nthis would appear as a canal when observed at finite resolution because of the\njump in the polarization angle.\nThe position of a canal produced by differential Faraday rotation must change\nwith the wavelength at which it is observed because F depends on \u03bb according to\nEq. (2.4). To a first approximation, a change of wavelength from \u03bb to \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb\nwill displace the canal by \u03b4x where\n\u03b4x \u2243\n\n\u03b4F\n,\n|\u2207F |\n\n\u03b4F = F (\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2212 F (\u03bb),\n\n|\u03b4\u03bb| \u226a \u03bb .\n\nFor example, if differential Faraday rotation is the only depolarization mechanism,\nwe have F = 2RM \u03bb2 with RM being independent of \u03bb, and then\n\u03b4x \u2243 2LRM\n\n\u03b4\u03bb\n,\n\u03bb\n\nLRM =\n\nRM\n,\n|\u2207RM|\n\nwhere LRM is the scale at which RM varies. Shukurov & Berkhuijsen (2003)\nargue, using a similar estimate, that the displacement can be difficult to observe\nif |\u03b4\u03bb| <\n\u223c \u03bb, which is often the case.\n\n2.2\n\nForeground Faraday screens\n\nIf synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation occur in distinct layers - with the\nrotating layer nearer to the observer as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) - the foreground\nmagneto-ionic medium is called a Faraday screen. If Faraday rotation in the screen\nis uniform across a telescope beam then no depolarization occurs; the polarization\nangle of radiation emerging from the emitting layer is rotated by \u2206\u03a8 = F , but\nthe mixing of different angles within a beam, that causes depolarization, does not\noccur. A Faraday screen can only cause depolarization if it is nonuniform on the\nscale of the beam, so that different lines of sight within the beam undergo differing\namounts of Faraday rotation.\n\n\fA. Fletcher & A. Shukurov: Depolarization canals\n\n11\n\n5\n\nFig. 6: The variation of the fractional polarization and polarization angle across\na Faraday screen with a smooth variation of Faraday depth described in Fig. 5\nwith x0 = 0.4, \u2206x = 0.2 and Xc = 0.5. Left-hand panels: (a) the change in\nthe beam-averaged degree of polarization (solid) and polarization angle (dashed)\nfor \u2206F = \u03c0/2 convolved with a square beam of width D = 0.2. The fractional\npolarization does not reduce to zero although \u03a8 changes by \u03c0/2 across the region.\nThe reason is illustrated in panel (b) where we show the change in the polarization\nangles obtained along individual lines of sight (dashes) within the beam (circle).\nIt is clear that the polarization cannot drop to zero in this configuration. The\nright-hand panels show the same as on the left, except that here \u2206F = \u03c0. Now,\npanel (c) shows that the fractional polarization does drop to zero at x = Xc\nproducing a canal, but the corresponding change in \u03a8 across the canal is \u03c0. Panel\n(d) explains how this variation in \u03a8 among individual lines of sight leads to the\ncomplete depolarization. The calculation used Eqs. 2.1\u20132.5 for the configuration\nof Fig. 5.\nConsider a uniform polarized radio source shining through a Faraday rotating\nlayer. Consider a simple variation of the Faraday depth in the sky plane shown\nin Fig. 5, where F changes by \u2206F across a distance \u2206x, and the width of the\ntelescope beam is D. We assume that the telescope beam has a square profile for\nsimplicity. In the regions where F = const in Fig. 5, Eq. (2.1) reduces to\n\u001a\nexp[2i(\u03c80 + F0 )] ,\nx < x0 \u2212 D/2 ,\n(2.11)\nP = p0\nexp[2i(\u03c80 + F0 + \u2206F )] , x > x0 + \u2206x + D/2 ,\nso p = Re P = p0 and no depolarization occurs if F is constant. In the region\nx0 + D/2 < x < x0 \u2212 D/2 + \u2206x, where F varies linearly, Eq.

(We ignore, for simplicity, the\nranges |x \u2212 x0 | < D/2 and |x \u2212 x0 + \u2206x| < D/2 with a mixture of constant F and\na gradient in F within a beam.) Then\np = p0\n\nsin \u2206FD\n.\n\u2206FD\n\n(2.13)\n\nThus, the depolarization in a continuously inhomogeneous screen is complete if\n|\u2206FD | = n\u03c0 and we can then expect a canal to form along a contour where\n|\u2207F | = n\u03c0/D (where we have replaced dF/dx by \u2207F ). An increment of |\u2206FD | =\nn\u03c0 across the beam means that the change in polarization angle across the canal\nis \u2206\u03a8 = 180\u25e6 , i.e., no change - see Eq. 2.12. However, canals attributed to a\nFaraday screen by Haverkorn et al. (2000) have \u2206\u03a8 = 90\u25e6 . As we illustrate in\nFig. 6, this change in \u03a8 in fact cannot produce a canal if F varies continuously:\na gradient in F that produces a 90\u25e6 change in polarization angle across the beam\ndoes not lead to complete depolarization, whereas a gradient that produces 180\u25e6\nof Faraday rotation does give p = 0. Canals with \u2206\u03a8 = 0 (or 180\u25e6 ) predicted here\nhave not yet been observed.\nDepolarization can be complete if the change in Faraday rotation within the\nbeam produces a mixture of polarization angles that exactly cancel each other.\nComplete cancellation depends on both the variations in the Faraday depth across\nthe screen \u2206F and the telescope resolution, so that the pattern of canals can\nchange very significantly if observed at different resolution.\nFigure 7 shows how the depth of a canal produced by a Faraday screen depends\non the increment in Faraday depth across the beam \u2206FD and on how well resolved\nthis increment is, \u2206x/D. We can see that all gradients in F can produce p = 0 if\nobserved at an appropriate resolution and so we should expect to see canals with\nall jumps in polarization angle across them. The only condition for that is that the\ntotal variation in F available exceeds \u03c0/2, the minimum that can produce a canal\nfor \u2206x/D \u226a 1. The jump in \u03a8 across the canal (which is one beam wide) in Fig. 7\nis equal to the corresponding value of \u2206F (shown in the legend) if \u2206x/D \u2264 1 and\nto \u2206FD otherwise.\nIt is evident from Fig. 7 that the only way that canals with \u2206\u03a8 = 90\u25e6 will be\npreferentially created is if the variations in F in the Faraday screen are discontinuous. In this case complete cancellation will only occur if all of the polarization\nangles within a beam are a mixture of exactly orthogonal pairs and canals will be\nformed along contours where \u2206FD = (2n + 1)\u03c0/2. Like the case of differential\nFaraday rotation, canals produced by discontinuities in a Faraday screen do not\ndepend on the resolution of the observations. In Section 3.2 we will discuss how\nthe statistical properties of canals formed by discontinuities in a Faraday screen\ncan provide information about the shock-wave turbulence in the diffuse ISM.\nFor a canal produced by a discontinuous change of \u2206F , the behaviour of Q\nand U across the canal can obtained from Eq. (2.11) with \u2206F = (2n + 1)\u03c0/2: each\n\n\fA. Fletcher & A.

Figure 4 shows an example of how Q and U change across\na canal produced in a Faraday screen and by differential Faraday rotation. In\ncontrast to the case of differential Faraday rotation, Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10), both Q\nand U of Eq. 2.14 will always change sign across a canal produced by a Faraday\nscreen. (A special case is where Q (or U ) is zero whereas U (or Q) changes sign at\nthe canal.) This offers an opportunity to reveal the nature of an observed canal\nfrom a careful analysis of the variation of Q and U across it.\n\n3\n\nWhat can we learn about the ISM from depolarization canals?\n\nIf the mechanism which forms a canal can be identified - for example by looking\nat the variation of Q and U across the canal - we then know the location of level\nlines of Faraday depth where |F | = n\u03c0, in the case of differential rotation, or the\nprojected position of discontinuities with |\u2206FD | = (2n + 1)\u03c0/2, for the action of a\nFaraday screen. In both cases, canals represent contours of a random function of\nposition in the plane of the sky, namely the Faraday depth or the magnitude of its\n\n\f14\n\nTitle : will be set by the publisher\n\nFig. 8: Crossings of a level Fc by a random function F (x) are indicated with\nvertical dashed lines.\n\ngradient. In this section we discuss how statistical properties of the contours of a\nrandom function can be used to measure its parameters, and hence how statistical\nproperties of the depolarization canals can be interpreted in terms of the properties\nof the random (turbulent) ISM.\n\n3.1\n\nDifferential Faraday rotation: contour statistics and turbulence\n\nAs we show here, the mean separation of the contours of a differentiable random\nfunction is sensitive to the curvature of its autocorrelation function at zero lag,\ni.e., to a parameter known as the Taylor microscale in turbulence theory. Reviews\nof this theory can be found in Longuet-Higgins (1957), Sveshnikov (1966) and\nVanmarcke (1983). Observations of canals (or contours of another observable),\nobtained under quite a modest resolution, provide a possibility to measure the\nTaylor microscale, related to the dissipation scale of the turbulent flow and to the\nReynolds number. Contour statistics have been used in astrophysics in the studies\nof structure formation (Peebles 1984; Barden et al. 1986; Ryden 1988; Ryden et\nal. 1989) and the cosmic microwave background (Coles & Barrow 1987).\n3.1.1 Overshoots of a random function in one dimension\nWe start with crossings of a random function of a single variable over a reference level (Fig. 8); a clear and detailed discussion of this problem can be found\nin \u00a79 of Sveshnikov (1966). Consider a stationary, differentiable random function\nof position F (x), whose realisation, or measured value, is denoted by F (x). (We\nhave in mind applications where F can be the Faraday depth or the magnitude\nof its gradient.) The function will pass, from below, through the level Fc in the\ninfinitesimal interval (x, x + dx) if the following inequalities are satisfied simultaneously: F (x) < Fc and F (x + dx) > Fc . For a continuous F (x), we can write\nF (x + dx) \u2248 F (x) + F \u2032 (x) dx, where F \u2032 = dF /dx. Thus we have\nFc \u2212 F \u2032 (x) dx < F (x) < Fc\n\nfor F \u2032 (x) > 0 .\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fA. Fletcher & A. Shukurov: Depolarization canals\n\n15\n\nIn order to calculate the probability that these two inequalities hold, consider the\njoint probability density of F and its derivative F \u2032 at a given position x, which we\ndenote f (F, F \u2032 ).

The probability of an overshoot is now\nequal to the probability that the following inequalities are satisfied simultaneously:\nF (x\u2032 ) > Fc ,\n\nF (x) < Fc ,\n\nx\u2032 = x + dx ,\n\nb dx, with V\nb = \u2207F /|\u2207F | the unit vector parallel to the gradient of\nwhere dx = V\nF . Expanding F (x\u2032 ) \u2248 F (x) + \u2207F * dx and retaining only the term linear in dx,\nwe reduce the above inequalities to\nFc \u2212 |\u2207F (x)| dx < F (x) < Fc ,\nand, using arguments similar to those that lead to Eq. (3.2) and further, we obtain\nthe probability of a crossing (either upward or downward) of the contour F (x) = Fc\nin two dimensions:\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\nf (Fc , V) |V| dVx dVy\n=\np(2)\nc\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\fA. Fletcher & A. Shukurov: Depolarization canals\n\n17\n\nwhere f (Fc , V) is the joint probability distribution of F and its gradient. This\nquantity can be identified with the mean length of the Fc contour per unit area,\nN2 = p(2)\nc .\nIn both one and two dimensions, the probability of crossing a contour is given\nby the mean value of the magnitude of the gradient of the random field at that\ncontour. As discussed by Ryden (1988), for an isotropic random field F , the mean\nnumber of crossings per unit length along a line, N1 , and the mean length of a\ncontour per unit area, N2 , are related,\nN2 =\n\n\u03c0\nN1 ,\n2\n\nand so statistical properties of contours in the plane can be conveniently studied\nusing one-dimensional cuts, which is technically easier.\n3.1.3 The separation of canals and parameters of ISM turbulence\nShukurov & Berkhuijsen (2003) applied a one-dimensional version of this theory\nto canals observed at \u03bb20.5 cm in the direction to the Andromeda nebula (around\nl = 120\u25e6 , b = \u221220\u25e6 ). Their estimate of the mean separation of canals is 5\u2032 which\nresults in a estimate of the Taylor microscale of RM (or, more precisely, the Faraday\ndepth) of lT \u2243 2\u2032 . For the presumed mean distance within the Milky Way's nonthermal disc in that direction, 1 kpc, the corresponding linear scale is 0.6 pc. If this\nscale can be identified with the Taylor microscale of interstellar turbulence (which\nmay or may not be the case!), the effective value of the Reynolds number follows\nas Re \u2243 (l0 /lT )2 \u2243 105 for the energy-range scale of l0 = 100 pc. This value of Re\nis many orders of magnitude smaller than those based on the molecular viscosity.\nIf this estimate can be confirmed by more comprehensive and deeper analyses,\nthis would imply that the dissipation range of the interstellar MHD turbulence is\ncontrolled by relatively large viscosities, perhaps associated with kinetic plasma\neffects. The latter are often described as anomalous viscosity or resistivity; useful\nrecent results were obtained in the context of galaxy clusters by Schekochihin et\nal. (2005).\n\n3.2\n\nFaraday screens: the mean separation of canals and shocks\n\nIf canals are caused by rotation measure discontinuities in a Faraday screen, the\nmean distance between them will be related to the distribution of discontinuities\nin the ISM. Most plausibly these are shock fronts. (Another possible source are\ntangential discontinuities but it is difficult to identify a physical reason for their\nwidespread occurrence.)\nA canal forms where the background Faraday depth F changes by |\u2206F | =\n(n + 1/2)\u03c0 across a shock front.

Combining\nEqs. (3.6) and (3.7), we obtain the minimum Mach number necessary to produce\na canal,\ns\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\u0014\n3\u01eb\u03c1\n1\n\u03c0\n4\n\u2212\n,\n|\u2206F | = .\n=\nM\u2217 \u2243\n(3.8)\n4 \u2212 \u01eb\u03c1\n3\n2\n3(|\u2206F/F0 | + 1)1/2\nAs follows from Sect. 2.2, stronger shocks can also produce canals.\nThe dominant source of the primary shocks are supernovae. When these shocks\nencounter gas clouds they will be reflected, generating a population of secondary\nshocks. Following Bykov & Toptygin (1987), the probability density function of\nboth primary and secondary shocks is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3C(\u03b1)fcl\n1\n,\n(3.9)\n+\nG(M) \u2243 G0\nM\u03b1+1\n(M \u2212 1)4\n\nwhere G0 = S 43 \u03c0r03 , S is the supernova rate per unit volume, r0 is the maximum\nradius of a supernova (primary) shock, and \u03b1 characterizes the dependence of the\nshock radius on the Mach number, r(M) = r0 M\u2212\u03b1/3 , fcl is the volume filling\nfactor of diffuse clouds and C(\u03b1) is a constant. For the Sedov solution, \u03b1 = 2 and\nfor a three-phase ISM, \u03b1 = 4.5; C(\u03b1) = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 for \u03b1 = 2 and 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 for\n\u03b1 = 4.5.

Fletcher & A. Shukurov: Depolarization canals\n\n19\n\nwhere \u03bdSN is the Galactic supernova rate, R and h are the radius and scale height\nof the star-forming disc respectively; the term in the square brackets is close 0.2\nfor M =R 1.2 and \u03b1 = 4.5. Projecting onto the sky plane changes L by a factor\n\u03c0\n\u03be = \u03c0 \u22121 0 sin2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 = 1/2. If the shocks fill a region of a depth d, the separation\nof the shocks in the plane of the sky is further reduced by a factor d/L. The\nangular separation L at an average distance d/2 to the shocks follows as\nL=\n\nL2\nd2\n\n(3.13)\n\nAs an example, let us use the observations by Haverkorn et al. (2003) as inputs\nto Eq. (3.13) and compare the observed separation of canals with the predicted\nseparation of shocks. In this field the average Faraday depth is F \u2243 \u03c0 radians and\nthe most abundant canals are produced when |\u2206F | = \u03c0/2, since weaker shocks are\nthe most abundant according to Eq. (3.9). Equation (3.8) then gives M\u2217 \u2243 1.2.\nThe maximum depth of the layer is estimated as d \u2243 600 pc. With the parameter\nvalues used to normalize Eq. (3.12) and fcl = 0.25, \u03b1 = 4.5, we obtain a mean\nseparation of canals of L \u2243 40 pc, or L \u2243 15\u2032 . The latter value is reasonably close\nto a by-eye estimate of the average separation of canals in Fig. 3 of Haverkorn et al.\n(2003) of 45\u2032 . Thus, the canals observed by Haverkorn et al. (2003) are compatible\nwith a system of shocks producing discontinuities in a Faraday screen. The canals\nin these observations appear to be straighter (or less twisting) than those observed\nat shorter wavelengths by, e.g., Uyan\u0131ker et al. (1998b) and Gaensleret al. (2001).\nThis might be expected if the straighter canals arise from shocks in the diffuse\nISM and the twisting canals have a different origin such as differential Faraday\nrotation. The Mach number of the shocks required to produce |\u2206F | = \u03c0/2 at\nmetre wavelengths is quite low, so that they can be inefficient in accelerating\ncosmic rays. Then the expected increase in total synchrotron emissivity at a\nshock is just M2\u2217 \u2243 1.5. Such features can be difficult to detect in total intensity\nradio maps, especially if their area covering factor is high.\n\n4\n\nProspects\n\nAt first sight, the chaotic appearance of radio polarization maps of the diffuse\nMilky Way emission and the difficulty of connecting standard statistical tools,\nsuch as power spectra, to ISM physics, makes interpretation of the data a daunting task. Moreover, changes in the polarization pattern with wavelength depend\non random quantities, such as the thermal electron density and magnetic field\nfluctuations. Analysis of the ubiquitous depolarization canals provides a practical\nstarting point from which we can develop the methods required to make full use of\nthe polarization observations. As we have shown here, the origin of canals can be\ndetermined from observed quantities - by examining how Q and U vary across a\ncanal - and their statistical measures are related to the parameters of interstellar\nturbulence. The extension of methods used to study canals to the wider analysis\nof polarized radio emission will lead to better techniques for separating Milky Way\nforegrounds from polarized cosmological signals.\n\n\f20\n\nTitle : will be set by the publisher\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust under research grant F/00 125/N.\nWe thank Wolfgang Reich for providing Figure 1 and N.
