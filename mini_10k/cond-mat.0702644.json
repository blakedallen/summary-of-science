One of the challenging aspects is a pronounced asymmetry of spectral properties\nbetween more investigated hole-doped and electron-doped\ncuprates (EDC), as revealed by recent ARPES experiments\non representatives of the latter materials, as Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4\n(NCCO) [2, 3] and Sm2\u2212x Cex CuO4 (SCCO) [4]. While the\nn-type parent compound Nd2 CuO4 has very similar excitation spectra to p-type undoped cuprates, the development with\ndoping is different. At low electron doping x \u223c 0.04 the\nARPES Fermi surface (FS) reveals pronounced pockets at\nk = (\u03c0, 0) consistent with doubling of the unit cell due to\nthe long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order [2]. With increasing x additional dispersive band-like excitation appears\nat \u03c9 < 0 and reaches the chemical potential (\u03c9 = 0) along the\ndiagonal k \u223c (\u03c0/2, \u03c0, 2) at intermediate doping x = 0.15,\nwhich coincides with the disappearance of long-range AFM\norder and the onset of superconductivity. Consequently, the\nFS transforms into a large one although still with well resolved\nquasiparticles only along parts of the FS [2, 3, 4]. More recent\nanalyses of NCCO [3] and SCCO [4] at intermediate doping\nseem to resolve both effective bands and found the connection\nwith the pseudogap observed in optical conductivity [4, 5].\nWhile in the latter the temperature dependence of the pseudogap reveals relation to the AFM correlations, there is so far\nno temperature-dependent ARPES data on EDC which would\ndirectly relate the ARPES pseudogap to AFM ordering.\nOn the theoretical side, the EDC represent another very\nstringent test for microscopic models of HTSC materials. It\nhas become increasingly clear that in prototype Hubbard tU model and reduced t-J model additional second-neighbor\nhopping t\u2032 (as well as third-neighbor t\u2032\u2032 ) can account well for\nthe asymmetry in several quantities [6, 7]. Still, the origin\nof the FS transformation from a pocket-like to a large one as\nfound by ARPES remains the central open issue. First theories were based on the strongly renormalized interaction U [8]\nand the scenario of doping-decreasing U was proposed which\nresults in both Hubbard bands crossing the FS at intermediate\n\ndoping [9, 10]. More recent slave-boson approach [11] and\nnumerical calculations within the Hubbard model, using the\nvariation-cluster [12] and dynamical-cluster approaches [13]\ngive indication that most features of FS reconstruction can\nbe reproduced with doping-independent U . More detailed\ninsight into the spectral properties has been obtained from\nthe numerical exact-diagonalization (ED) study of t-t\u2032 -t\u2032\u2032 -J\nmodel at T = 0 [7]. However, results show persistence of\nthe pseudogap in the nodal direction even in the overdoped\nregime. Also, the temperature behavior of the pseudogap in\nspectral function (SF) has not been clarified yet.\nIn this Letter we present results of a numerical study of the\nt-t\u2032 -J model at finite T > 0 which reveal that most qualitative features of ARPES results are a nontrivial consequence\nof strong correlations and do not require a doping-dependent\nmodel parameters, in particular not the closing of the MottHubbard gap. We show that the pseudogap vanishes with\ndoping in the nodal direction as well as above the pseudogap temperature T \u2217 being closely tied to the disappearance of\nlonger-range AFM correlations. In the same way the FS transforms from a pocket-like into a continuous large one. Further,\nour results allow for the interpretation of two effective subbands both emerging from an AFM splitting of a correlated\n(upper Hubbard) band. Numerically evaluated \u03c3(\u03c9) can be\nalso explained within the same pseudogap scenario.\nIn the following we study the t-t\u2032 -J model\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\ni,j,s\n\ntij c\u0303\u2020js c\u0303is + J\n\nX\nhiji\n\n1\n(Si * Sj \u2212 ni nj ),\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c\u0303\u2020is are projected fermionic operators not allowing the\ndouble occupancy of sites. On a square lattice we include\nbesides the nearest-neighbor hopping tij = t also the secondneighbor hopping tij = t\u2032 , where we take t\u2032 = 0.3t, as relevant for EDC [6, 7]. We also fix J = 0.3 t.\nFor the calculation of the SF, A(k, \u03c9), we use the finitetemperature Lanczos method (FTLM) [14]. It has been shown\nthat on small systems reachable by ED the calculation at\nT > 0 gives more macroscopic-like results and gives a better\ncontrolled approach to T \u2192 0 provided that T > Tf s where\n\n\f2\nTf s is the finite-size temperature determined by the model and\nsystem size [14]. For cases considered here with tilted square\nlattices of N = 18, 20 sites and Ne = 0 \u2212 4 doped electrons\nwe have Tf s \u223c 0.1 t. On small systems with fixed boundary\nconditions one can consider only a discrete set of wavevectors kl , l = 1, N . To scan the whole Brillouin zone of k we\nemploy twisted boundary conditions by introducing hopping\nelements tij \u2192 t\u0303ij = tij exp(i~\n\u03b8 * ~rij ) in Eq. (1), in this way\nreaching arbitrary momenta k = kl + ~\n\u03b8 [7]. Using FTLM we\ncalculate the Green's function G(k, \u03c9) and therefrom extract\nthe self energy \u03a3(k, \u03c9) = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b6k \u2212 \u03b1/G(k, \u03c9). Borrowing the idea from cluster dynamical mean-field approaches we\nsmoothen \u03a3(k, \u03c9) over small interval \u03b4k \u223c 0.3 and then recalculate SF.

On the other hand, white crosses in Figs. 1a-c\nindicate a k-line where the SF shows symmetric pseudogap.\nNote that the line of zeroes in the real part of the Green's function determining the Luttinger sum rule is then represented by\nthe combination of both lines. It is indicative in Fig. 1b that\nalready for ce = 2/20 both lines nearly touch as a precursor\nof a large FS formation.\nAs the doping is further increased, in Fig. 1c, the FS is\nformed almost along the whole Luttinger line. The pockets\nare completely opened and the transfer of the SF weight into\nthe nodal region is observed, although the pseudogap feature\nremains visible as seen in Fig. 2c. Finally, at ce = 4/18\nin Fig. 1d the pseudogap disappears also in the nodal direction resulting in a large continuous FS. In addition, the SF in\nFig. 2d are well consistent with the usual quasiparticle peak\ncrossing the chemical potential.\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\n0.5\nkx \u0090 \u03c0\n\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n\n1\n\n0.5 A\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n0 \u03a9\u0090t\n\n4\n\nkx \u0090 \u03c0\n\n8\n\n1\n\n0.5 A\n\nHcL\n\n0 \u03a9\u0090t\n\n4\n\n8\n\nHdL\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Contour plot of A(k, \u03c9 = 0) representing\nthe Fermi surface for different electron doping: (a) ce = 1/20, (b)\nce = 2/20, (c) ce = 3/20, and (d) ce = 4/18.

Data in Fig. 1 are supplemented with Fig. 2 where full A(k, \u03c9) are presented along\nthe AFM zone-boundary line.\nAt the lowest doping ce = 1/20 in Fig. 1a we get quasiparticle weight forming a circle-like structure around the (\u03c0, 0)\npoint, well known as the electron pocket consistent with several experimental and theoretical studies [2, 7, 8, 11]. The\nFS scan looks similar also for ce = 2/20 in Fig. 1b except\nthat the pocket gets more asymmetric weight (opening from\nthe ky = 0 side) around (\u03c0, 0).

We present A(k, \u03c9)\nin the nodal point of the Luttinger surface located as shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 3a. It is evident that a pronounced dip in SF\nat low doping ce < 0.15 fills up with increasing doping and\ntransforms into a usual peak at ce = 4/18. The pseudogap\nis clearly manifested also in the behavior of the corresponding self-energies \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (k, \u03c9) in Fig. 3b. Besides the overall linear dependence |\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (k, \u03c9)| \u221d \u03c9 for \u03c9 > 0, characteristic for\nanomalous (marginal) Fermi liquid and well established also\n\n\f3\nin hole-doped cuprates [1, 16], additional narrow Lorentzian\nat \u03c9 \u223c 0 reveals the pseudogap and its strength [16]. Again,\nthis feature vanishes at ce = 4/18, but as well disappears\nwith increasing T . The intensity (the area) \u22062 of the pseudogap contribution in \u03a3\u2032\u2032 (k, \u03c9) is the measure of the pseudogap\nwidth, i.e. \u221d \u2206 [16]. Therefore we present in Fig. 3c T dependence of \u22062 for different ce . It is evident that temperature T \u2217 above which the pseudogap effectively disappears\ndecreases with ce and exists only in the underdoped regime\nwith ce < 4/18. This clearly links pseudogap to the presence\nof longer-range AFM correlations in the system. In this sense,\nthe pseudogap discussed here is related to large (high-energy)\npseudogap observed in hole-doped cuprates [1].\n\n0.4\n\n(a)\n\nT/t=0.1\n\nce=1/20\nce=2/20\nce=3/20\nce=4/18\n\nA\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\nq\n(4t\u0303\u03b3k )2 + ws\u03042 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b3k = (cos kx + cos ky )/2, \u03b3k\u2032 = cos kx cos ky are\ncorresponding to first and second-nearest neighbor effective\nhopping t\u0303, t\u0303\u2032 , respectively. The dispersion of the form (2) can\nbe considered as an effective tight-binding band split due to\nlong-range AFM s\u0304 6= 0 and can be analytically derived from\nthe t-t\u2032 -J (or Hubbard) model using the memory-function approach [15] whereby t\u0303, t\u0303\u2032 are renormalized by strong correlations. Very similar bands have been recently used to describe\nobserved ARPES spectra in SCCO [4].\nIn Fig. 4 we also plot fits of \u01eb\u00b1 (k), with corresponding\nintensity of subbands shown in the scale from black (no intensity) to white. We note that the main doping dependence\nemerges through s\u0304 = 0.35 \u2212 0 which is the largest for low\ndoping and zero at ce = 4/18 while other parameters are only\nweakly doping dependent, e.g. t\u0303/t = 0.3 \u2212 0.6, \u2212t\u0303\u2032/t =\n0.1 \u2212 0.2 and w = t2 .\n4\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/t\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n8\n\nce =1\u009020\n\n2\n\nce =2\u009020\n\n-\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n0.4\n2\n\n0\n\n(\u2206/t)\n\n||\n\n\u01eb\u00b1 (k) = \u22124t\u0303\u2032 \u03b3k\u2032 \u00b1\n\n(0,0)\n\n0.1\n\n-\u03a3 /t\n\nthe form,\n\n2\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\nce =3\u009020\n\nce =4\u009018\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c9/t\n\n4\n\n0.1\n\nT/t\n\n0.2\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) a) A(k, \u03c9) in the nodal point of the Luttinger surface presented in the inset, b) corresponding self-energies\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (k, \u03c9), and c) pseudogap intensity \u22062 vs. T for different ce .\n\nIn Fig. 4 we present a weight map of A(k, \u03c9) along symmetry lines in the first Brillouin zone. Again, one can notice\nstrong electron-pocket contribution close to (\u03c0, 0) and evident\npseudogap in the nodal direction at lowest ce = 1/20 which\nbecomes less pronounced at higher doping and disappears at\nce = 4/18. In addition, it is interesting to follow effective\nbands which are clearly seen in Fig. 4. At lowest ce = 1/20\none can well resolve the two-band structure, at least along certain k directions, e.g., along (0, 0)\u2212(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), (0, 0)\u2212(\u03c0, 0)\nas well as (\u03c0, 0) \u2212 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). This feature dissolves with\ndoping and finally at ce = 4/18 transforms into a single band.\nSuch a two-band structure is very close to the one observed\nand analyzed in ARPES on EDC [3, 4]. The weaker band can\nbe interpreted as the shadow-one due to AFM order and its\nintensity can be linked to AFM order parameter s\u0304. In fact, results in Fig. 4 can be well represented by effective bands of\n\n-\n\n\u03c0\u03c0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 ,\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2 2\n\n-\n\n\u03c0,0\n\n\u03c0,\u03c0\n\n0\n\n0,0\n\n\u03c0,0\n\n0.75\n\n\u00c8\n\n0\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) Weight map A(k, \u03c9) along symmetry lines\nin the first Brillouin zone for different dopings and T /t = 0.1. The\nfit to split subbands is shown with the corresponding intensities.\n\nHere we comment also on the asymmetry of high-energy\ndispersion (\u03c9 < 0) between hole and electron-doped systems. From Fig. 4 we can clearly see that the dispersion from\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) to (0, 0) is a rather standard one without significant kinks, but for \u03c9 > 0, which corresponds to \u03c9 < 0 case of\nthe hole-doped system in t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2212 J models, a kink behavior\nis seen along (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) as well as from (\u03c0, 0) to\n(\u03c0, \u03c0). This difference is consistent with related asymmetry\nobserved in ARPES recently[18]. The details will be given\nelsewhere[19].\n\n\f4\nFinally, let us discuss the relation with the optical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) in EDC [4, 5] which also shows pronounced pseudogap at low doping. First, we evaluate \u03c3(\u03c9) directly by\ncalculating the dynamical current-current correlations in the\nground state at T = 0 and via FTLM at T > 0 [14, 17]. Results for T = 0 and T /t = 0.15 t at different ce are presented\nin Fig.5. On the other hand, to establish the relation with the\npseudogap observed in SF we also consider the simplest (decoupling) approximation in terms of SF neglecting the vertex\ncorrections,\nZ\n2\u03c0 X\n2\n\u03c3d (\u03c9) =\n(vk )\nd\u03c9 \u2032 g(\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 )A(k, \u03c9 \u2032 )A(k, \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9),\n\u03c9N\nk\n(3)\nwhere g(\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 ) = f (\u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9) \u2212 f (\u03c9 \u2032 ) and vk are bare band\nvelocities as determined by t, t\u2032 . Numerically evaluated SF as\npresented above are inserted into Eq. (3) and results are plotted in Fig. 5 as black lines. A nontrivial message following\nfrom Fig. 5 is that \u03c3d (\u03c9) yields very good overall qualitative\nand even quantitative agreement with the exactly evaluated\n\u03c3(\u03c9) (at T > 0), whereby features are plausibly broader in\n\u03c3d (\u03c9).\n\n2\n\u03c3 (e0 /--h)\n\n0.5\n\nce=1/20\n\nconvolution T/t=0.1\nexact T/t=0.15\nexact T=0\n\nce=2/20\n\nce=3/20\n\nce=4/18\n\n0\n\nIn conclusion, presented results for spectral functions and\noptical conductivity show overall good qualitative and even\nquantitative agreement with experimental results on EDC with\ndifferent doping, both for ARPES on NCCO and SCCO\n[2, 3, 4], and \u03c3(\u03c9) [4, 5]. Since we have used the simplest\nprototype model, Eq.(1), for strongly correlated electrons with\nfixed parameters, observed nontrivial phenomena as the Fermi\nsurface reconstruction, pseudogap and split bands appear as a\ndirect consequence of strong correlations. So there is no need\nto invoke a doping-dependent Mott-Hubbard gap.\nIn comparison with more investigated hole-doped cuprates,\nEDC seem to have an advantage that anomalous SF as well as\n\u03c3(\u03c9) can be explained in a more straightforward way by invoking the long-range AFM order s\u0304, persisting in EDC materials up to ce = 0.15. In particular, the double effective bands\nas seen in Fig. 4 at lower doping as well as in recent ARPES\nexperiments [3, 4] can be interpreted with a band splitting\nproportional to s\u0304, Eq.(2), which disappears in the overdoped\nregime.\nThe pseudogap which is pronounced in SF along the zone\ndiagonal and in \u03c3(\u03c9), shows strong doping and temperature\ndependence, whereby we can establish the pseudogap temperature T \u2217 (ce ) consistent with the one deduced from the optical\nconductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) [5] but so far not analyzed with ARPES.\nBoth doping and T -dependence clearly establish longer-range\nAFM correlations as the origin of the pseudogap in EDC.\nThis work was supported by the Slovenian Research\nAgency under grant PI-0044.

Black lines represent\n\u03c3d (\u03c9) calculated from the convolution of spectral functions at T /t =\n0.1.\n\nAt low doping, ch = 1/20, 2/20 we can observe at T /t =\n0.15 t a hump in \u03c3(\u03c9) at \u03c9/t \u223c 0.7, even more pronounced\nat T = 0, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of\nthe pseudogap. The same peak-dip feature is also resolved\n(although with somewhat shifted peak) in convoluted \u03c3d (\u03c9)\nwhich is the indication that the pseudogap in conductivity has\nthe same origin as the one in the SF. Furthermore, vk is the\nlargest along the nodal part of the FS so it is plausible that\n\u03c3(\u03c9) also tests the nodal pseudogap. Further doping suppresses the peak-dip feature in Fig. 5 at ce = 4/18 which\ncan be related to the simultaneous pseudogap disappearance\nin A(k, \u03c9).\n\n[1] A. Damascelli, Z. Hussain, and Z.-X.
