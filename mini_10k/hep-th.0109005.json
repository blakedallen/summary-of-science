The minimal realizations of classical Lie algebras and of G2 were given by Joseph a\nlong time ago [22, 23]. The existence of the minimal unitary representation\nof E8(8) was first proved by Vogan [35] who located it within the framework\nof Langland's classification. Later, the minimal unitary representations of\nall simply laced groups, including E8(8) , E7(7) and E6(6) were constructed by\nKazhdan and Savin [25], and Brylinski and Kostant [5, 6, 7, 8] by rather\ndifferent methods. Gross and Wallach gave yet another construction of the\nminimal representation of E8(8) as well as for all exceptional groups of real\nrank four [17]. For the exceptional group E8(8) the minimal orbit is 58\ndimensional, corresponding to its quotient by a distinguished parabolic subgroup. The representations of E8(8) over the spaces of functions on the 128\ndimensional coset space E8(8) /SO(16) were studied in [1].\nWhile formulas for G2 similar to the ones derived here for E8(8) can be\nfound in [6], however, an explicit realization of the simple root (Chevalley)\ngenerators in terms of pseudo-differential operators for the simply laced exceptional groups was given only very recently [26], together with the spherical\nvectors necessary for the construction of modular forms. We present here\nan alternative realization of E8(8) , which has the advantage of yielding very\ncompact formulas, in contradistinction to the rather complicated expressions\nobtained by multiple commutation of the simple root generators [27]. The\nmain reason for the relative simplicity of our final expressions (7) and (12) is\ntheir manifest E7(7) covariance, in spite of the fact that E7(7) is not realized\nlinearly. The compactness of our formulas makes them especially suitable\nfor applications in string and M theory which have primarily motivated the\npresent work.\nAlthough the present article is mainly addressed to a physicists' audience, let us first summarize the main results in a somewhat more mathematical language. The minimal representation of a noncompact group G\ncorresponds, in general, to the quantization of its smallest co-adjoint orbit.\nIn the case of E8(8) the minimal co-adjoint orbit is 58-dimensional. Starting\nfrom the 5-graded decomposition of the associated Lie algebra e8 given in\neq. (4) below, it can be obtained simply as the co-adjoint orbit of the highest\nroot generator (designated by E in eq. (6)). In this 5-graded decomposition\n1\n\nA preliminary account of some of the results presented in section 2 has already appeared in [29].\n\n\f3\n\nM. G\u00fcnaydin et al.\n\nof e8 one can readily identify a maximal non-semisimple subalgebra p as the\nannihilator of this generator, i.e.\n[p, E] = 0\n\n(1)\n\nThe subalgebra p is generated by the grade zero subalgebra e7 together\nwith the grade 1 and grade 2 elements of the full e8 Lie algebra (i.e. the\ngenerators (Eij , E ij ) and E in eq. (6)). The orthogonal complement of this\nparabolic subalgebra is a 58 dimensional nilpotent subalgebra n. In the\nnotation of section 2, the latter is generated by the grade 0 element H, the\ngrade (\u22121) elements (Fij , F ij ), and the grade (\u22122) element F . Acting with\nthis nilpotent subalgebra on the generator E corresponding to the highest\nroot one obtains the generators corresponding to the minimal orbit. Thus\nwe see that the minimal orbit can be identified with the coset space E8(8) /P\nwhere P is the parabolic subgroup generated by p.\nWe were led to this minimal unitary representation rather naturally from\nthe novel geometric realization of E8(8) on R57 found in our previous work\n[18]. As shown there, the exceptional groups can be realized via conformal or\nquasiconformal transformations leaving invariant generalized \"light-cones\";\nthese transformations are analogous to the non-linear action of the M\u00f6bius\ngroup on the real line. Our construction relied essentially on the connection\nwith Jordan algebras and Freudenthal triple systems. To proceed from there\nto the unitary realization on a suitable (infinite dimensional) Hilbert space of\nfunctions, we must first identify a phase space realization of this system and\nthen quantize it. For the E7(7) subgroup this phase space realization involves\n28 coordinates X ij and 28 momenta Pij , such that all E7(7) variations can\nbe realized via the canonical action\n\u03b4Q X \u2261 {Q , X}P.B. ,\n\n\u03b4Q P \u2261 {Q , P }P.B.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Q = Q(X, P ) is the appropriate E7(7) charge. For the canonical realization of the full E8(8) we have to add the momentum p conjugate to the\n57th coordinate y, and replace the M\u00f6bius action on y by the symplectic\nrealization acting on the two dimensional phase space spanned by y and\np. The minimal unitary representation of E8(8) is then obtained by quantization, i.e. replacement of the classical momenta by differential operators.\nThis requires in addition a prescription how to deal with the ordering ambiguities arising in the non-linear expressions for the Lie algebra generators.\nThe latter\u0001are then realized as self-adjoint operators on some dense subspace\nof L2 R29 . This coordinate space (Schr\u00f6dinger) representation is reformulated in section 3 as an oscillator realization in terms of annihilation and\ncreation operators acting in a particle basis. By going to the corresponding\n\n\f4\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\ncoherent state basis of this oscillator realization labelled by 29 complex coordinates one obtains the Fock-Bargmann realization of the minimal unitary\nrepresentation over an Hilbert space of holomorphic functions.\nThe irreducibility of the minimal representation is put in evidence by\nshowing that the quadratic Casimir operator of E8(8) , when expressed in\nterms of either the coordinate or the oscillator basis reduces to a c-number;\na general argument shows that likewise the higher order Casimirs reduce to cnumbers in our realization. When restricted to the subgroup E7(7) \u00d7SL(2, R)\nthe minimal representation decomposes into an infinite sum (actually an integral, see [5]) of irreducible representations of E7(7) \u00d7SL(2, R). Remarkably,\nthe quadratic Casimir of E7(7) obtained from the minimal realization is identical with the quartic invariant of E7(7) when expressed as a function of the\n28 coordinate and 28 momentum operators (or equivalently, the 28 annihilation and 28 creation operators in the oscillator basis). The irreducible\nrepresentations of SL(2, R) that occur in the decomposition of the minimal\nrepresentation E8(8) w.r.t. E7(7) \u00d7SL(2, R) are all labelled by the eigenvalues\nof this quartic invariant.\nAs already mentioned our chief aim with the present work is to present\nthe results in such a way that they can be readily applied in the context of\nstring and M theory (for instance, readers familiar with [10] should have no\ndifficulties following our exposition). In particular, our results apply in the\ncontext of the (super)conformal quantum mechanics description of quantum\nblack holes [11, 9, 30]. In that work, unitary representations of SL(2, R)\nplayed a crucial role in the classification of physical states. It is therefore\nan obvious idea to extend these concepts to maximal supergravity. Indeed,\nthe candidate Hamiltonian which we obtain as one of the E8(8) Lie algebra\ngenerators reads\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(3)\nL0 = 41 p2 + y 2 + 4 y \u22122 I4 (X, P )\n\nwhich is precisely of the form studied by the authors of [11, 9, 30], with the\nonly difference that they have a (coupling) constant instead of the differential operator I4 (X, P ). Here I4 is the quartic invariant of E7(7) expressed as\na function of the 28+28 variables X ij and Pij ; when acting on one of the\nirreducible subrepresentations of E7(7) under its subgroup E7(7) \u00d7 SL(2, R)\nit yields the associated eigenvalue of the quadratic E7(7) Casimir. As shown\nfor instance in [18] in the context of the classical theory, the quartic invariant can assume both positive and negative values, and vanishes for 12 or 41\nBPS black hole solutions of N = 8 supergravity [24, 14, 13]. It is therefore tempting to interpret (3) as the effective Hamiltonian describing (in\nsome approximation) N = 8 quantum black holes, such that every subrepresentation with a fixed eigenvalue of the operator I4 is identified with the\n\n\f5\n\nM. G\u00fcnaydin et al.\n\nspace of physical states associated with the corresponding black hole solution of N = 8 supergravity. An interpretation along similar lines has also\nbeen suggested in [16]. Interestingly, for the vanishing eigenvalues of I4 , the\nHamiltonian simplifies drastically, and the state space reduces to the well\nknown singleton representation of SL(2, R).\nAnother (and possibly related) physical application of minimal representations has been outlined in [26]. That work evolved from an earlier\nattempt to determine the R4 corrections directly from the supermembrane\nand to understand them in terms of so-called \"theta-correspondences\" [31];\nsee also [34] for a related attempt to come to grips with the non-linearities\nof the supermembrane.\n\n2\n\nCoordinate Space (Schr\u00f6dinger) Representation\n\nWe first recall some basic features of the non-linear realization of E8(8) on\nR57 coordinatized by 57 real variables {X ij , Xij , y} (i, j = 1, . . . , 8), see [18]\nfor our notations and conventions, and further details. A key ingredient in\nthat construction was the 5-graded decomposition of E8(8) w.r.t. its subgroup\nE7(7) \u00d7 SL(2, R). Denoting its Lie algebra by e8 we have\ne8 = g\u22122 \u2295 g\u22121 \u2295 g0 \u2295 g+1 \u2295 g+2 .\n\n(4)\n\nAn important property of this decomposition is the fact that the subspaces\nof grade \u22121 and \u22122 together form a maximal Heisenberg subalgebra. The\ncorresponding generators E ij , Eij \u2208 g\u22121 and E \u2208 g\u22122 obey the commutation\nrelations\nij\n[E ij , Ekl ] = 2i \u03b4kl\nE.\n\n(5)\n\nObviously, this algebra can be realized as a classical Poisson algebra on a\nphase space with 28 coordinates X ij and 28 momenta Pij \u2261 Xij , and one\nextra real coordinate y to represent the central term. We have\nE ij := y X ij ,\n\nEij := y Pij ,\n\nE :=\n\n1\n2\n\ny2.\n\n(6)\n\nIt is then straightforward to determine the generators of the e7 subalgebra\nin terms of these phase space variables (for instance by requiring that they\nreproduce the E7(7) variations via (2)). They are realized by the following\n63+70 bilinear expressions in X ij and Pij\nGi j := 2 X ik Pkj + 41 X kl Pkl \u03b4ji ,\nGijkl := \u2212 12 X [ij X kl] +\n\n1 ijklmnpq\nPmn Ppq\n48 \u01eb\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\n\f6\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\nTo extend this canonical realization to the full E8(8) , we need one more\nvariable, the momentum p conjugate to y. Combining the symplectic realization of SL(2, R) with the non-linear variations (23) and (24) of [18] we\ncan then deduce the classical (phase space) analogs of the E8(8) generators.\nOwing to the non-linearity of the realization, the resulting expressions are\nnot only quadratic, but go up to fourth order in the phase space variables\nX ij and Pij , and moreover contain inverse powers of y. Thus all generators\nof E8(8) can be realized on a 58-dimensional phase space coordinatized by\n{X ij , Pij ; y, p}. The minimal unitary 29 dimensional representation of E8(8)\nis then obtained by quantization, i.e. by introducing the usual momentum\noperators obeying the canonical commutation relations\nij\n[X ij , Pkl ] = i \u03b4kl\n,\n\n[y, p] = i .\n\nIn elevating the E8(8) generators to quantum operators the only problem\nvis-\u00e0-vis the classical phase space description is the non-commutativity of\nthe coordinate and momentum operators, which requires some ordering prescription (we note, that the E7(7) generators (7) are insensitive to re-ordering\nthe coordinates and momenta). Since we are interested in finding a unitary\nrepresentation we insist that all\n\u0001 operators are hermitean w.r.t. to the standard scalar product on L2 R29 . We thus arrive at a unitary representation\nof the E8(8) Lie algebra in terms of self-adjoint operators acting on (some\ndense subspace of) a Hilbert space of complex functions in 29 real variables\n{X ij , y}. We emphasize that this realization requires complex functions, for\nthe same reason that the Schr\u00f6dinger representation of the one-dimensional\npoint particle requires complex wave functions2 .\nBefore writing out the E8(8) generators, let us list the E7(7) commutation\nrelations\n[Gi j , Gk l ] = i \u03b4kj Gi l \u2212 i \u03b4il Gk j ,\n[k\n\nlmn]i\n\n[Gi j , Gklmn ] = \u22124i \u03b4j G\n[Gijkl , Gmnpq ] =\n\n\u2212 2i \u03b4ij Gklmn ,\n\ni ijkls[mnp q]\nG s.\n36 \u01eb\n\n(8)\n\nObserve that only the SL(8, R) subgroup acts by linear transformations; its\nmaximal compact subgroup SO(8) is generated by G\u2212\nij , where\nG\u00b1\nij :=\n\n\u0001\n1\nGi j \u00b1 Gj i .\n2\n\n(9)\n\n2\nAs we show in the next section the generators of E8(8) can be rewritten in terms of\nbosonic annihilation and creation operators. In the corresponding coherent state basis the\nHilbert space will involve holomorphic functions in 29 variables.\n\n\f7\n\nM.

Orderings that differ from (13)\nby a term containing the Euler operator iX ij Pij break E7(7) invariance. On\nthe other hand, (14) is insensitive to re-orderings which differ from (13) only\nby a c-number, and in the absence of a preferred ordering there is thus no\nabsolute significance to the additive constant appearing in the definition of\nI4 . For instance, an admissible re-ordering is\n\u2212 61 Gi j Gj i \u2212 Gijkl Gijkl = I4 (X, P ) \u2212\n\n323\n16\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nThis relation confirms our previous assertion that, when acting on a given\nrepresentation of E7(7) , I4 is just the quadratic E7(7) Casimir invariant, up\nto an additive constant.\nFor the derivation of (12), we note that, as already pointed out in [5], the\ncrucial step is the determination of the operators E and F corresponding to\nthe lowest and highest root of E8(8) , respectively. The expressions for F ij\nand Fij then follow by commutation with E ij and Eij . While the derivation\nof [5] relied on a generalization of the so-called \"Capelli-identity\", the form\nof our operators E and F follows directly from E7(7) invariance and a scaling\nargument, up to the additive constant in (13). The latter originates from\nthe re-ordering required to bring the commutator of Fij and F ij into the\n\"standard form\" defined by the r.h.s. of (13).\nAs anticipated, all generators transform covariantly under the full E7(7)\ngroup.\n[Gi j , E kl ] = i \u03b4kj E il \u2212 i \u03b4lj E ik \u2212 4i \u03b4ij E kl ,\n[Gi j , Ekl ] = i \u03b4ik Elj \u2212 i \u03b4il Ekj + 4i \u03b4ij Ekl ,\n[Gi j , F kl ] = i \u03b4kj F il \u2212 i \u03b4lj F ik \u2212 4i \u03b4ij F kl ,\n[Gi j , Fkl ] = i \u03b4ik Flj \u2212 i \u03b4il Fkj + 4i \u03b4ij Fkl .\n\n(16)\n\nThe remaining part of E7(7) acts as\nkl]\n[Gijkl , Emn ] = \u2212i \u03b4[ij\n,\nmn E\n\n[Gijkl , E mn ] = \u2212 24i \u01ebijklmnpq Epq ,\nkl]\n[Gijkl , Fmn ] = \u2212i \u03b4[ij\n,\nmn F\n\n[Gijkl , F mn ] = \u2212 24i \u01ebijklmnpq Fpq .\n\n(17)\n\n\f9\n\nM.

As can be verified by computation of the Cartan Killing form from the structure constants that can\nbe extracted from the above commutation relations, the maximal compact\nsubgroup SO(16) is generated by the following linear combinations of E8(8)\ngenerators\n\u2212\nij\nij\nG\u2212\nij , Gijkl , Eij + F , E \u2212 Fij , E + F .\n\n(20)\n\nThis confirms that we are indeed dealing the split real form E8(8) .\nThe quadratic E8(8) Casimir operator (in a convenient normalization) is\na sum of three terms\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\nC2 E8(8) = C2 SL(2, R) + C2 E7(7) + C2\u2032\n(21)\nwith\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nC2 SL(2, R) := 21 (EF + F E \u2212 21 H 2 ) ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nC2 E7(7) := \u2212 21 Gi j Gj i \u2212 3 Gijkl Gijkl ,\nC2\u2032\n\n=\n\n1\n4\n\n\u0001\nE ij Fij + Fij E ij \u2212 Eij F ij \u2212 F ij Eij .\n\n(22)\n\nHere the terms in the first and second line represent the Casimir operators\nof the SL(2, R) and E7(7) subalgebras, respectively.

Of course, unlike for\nthe group SL(2, R) 3 , this result does not by itself imply the irreducibility of\nthe minimal representation of E8(8) . To show that, we have to compute in\naddition the eigenvalues of the higher order E8(8) Casimir invariants. However, it is almost self-evident that these, too, will collapse to c-numbers when\nthe coordinates and momenta are substituted, for the simple reason that we\ncannot build E8(8) invariants from the coordinate and momentum operators\nalone. This is in stark contrast to the singleton representation of E7(7) for\nwhich the coordinates and momenta do form a non-trivial (linear) representation of E7(7) , permitting the construction of non-vanishing higher order\nE7(7) invariants. This provides an independent argument that the minimal\nrepresentation of E8(8) is indeed irreducible.\nWe conclude this section by giving the Chevalley generators corresponding to the eight simple roots of E8(8) , with the labeling indicated in the\nfigure.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 1: Numbering of simple roots of E8(8)\n\n3\n\nModulo the subtlety that the two singleton irreps of SL(2, R) have the same eigenvalue\nof the Casimir.\n\n\f11\n\nM.

Accordingly, the\nlinearly realized subgroup exposed there is also different from ours.\n\n3\n\nOscillator Representation\n\nIn the coordinate representation, the linearly realized SL(8, R) subalgebra\nof E7(7) plays a distinguished role. As is well known, however, there is\nanother basis of E7(7) , which is equally important in supergravity and superstring theory, where SL(8, R) is replaced by SU (8) [10]. In this section,\nwe demonstrate that the full E8(8) Lie algebra can be rewritten in terms of\nthis complex basis. The change of basis is equivalent to the replacement\nof coordinates and momenta by creation and annihilation operators, and\nthus to the replacement of the coordinate representation by a holomorphic\n\n\f12\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\n(Bargmann-Fock) representation.

The unitary lowest (highest)\nweight representations belong to the holomorphic (anti-holomorphic) discrete series and within these representations the spectrum of, at least, one\n\n\f16\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\ngenerator is bounded from below (above). More generally, a non-compact\ngroup G admits representations belonging to the discrete series if it has the\nsame rank as its maximal compact subgroup4 . Thus the non-compact group\nE8(8) as well as E7(7) admit discrete series representations. However, they\nare not of the lowest or highest weight type.\nIn this subsection we will analyze the decomposition of the minimal representation of E8(8) with respect to its subgroup E7(7) \u00d7 SL(2, R), but using\nthe complex basis of the last section. The group SU (1, 1) admits holomorphic and anti-holomorphic unitary representations, and they exhaust the list\nof discrete series representations for SU (1, 1). (This is not true for higher\nrank non-compact groups admitting such representations.) As mentioned\nearlier, the realization of the SU (1, 1) subgroup within the minimal unitary\nrepresentation of E8(8) is precisely of the form that arises in conformal quantum mechanics [11]. This is perhaps not surprising since we obtained our\nrealization from the geometric action of E8(8) as a quasi-conformal group in\n57 dimensions [18].\nBy comparison of the SU (1, 1) subgroup (45) with that of [11] it follows\nthat the coupling constant g in conformal quantum mechanics is simply\ng = 4 I4 (X, P )\nin our realization. The quadratic Casimir of SU (1, 1) is\n\u0002\n\u0003\nC2 SU (1, 1) = L20 \u2212 21 (L1 L\u22121 + L\u22121 L1 ) = I4 (X, P ) \u2212\n\n(52)\n\n3\n16\n\n.\n\n(53)\n\nThus for a given eigenvalue of I4 (X, P ), we are led to a definite unitary realization of SU (1, 1). As we showed above, I4 (X, P ) is simply the quadratic\nCasimir operator of E7(7) (cf. (15)) that commutes with SU (1, 1), up to\nan additive normal ordering constant. Hence classifying all the possible\neigenvalues of I4 (X, P ) within the minimal unitary realization of E8(8) is\nequivalent to giving the decomposition of the E8(8) representation with respect to E7(7) \u00d7 SU (1, 1)5 . Unitarity requires the eigenvalues of the Casimir\noperators to be real. Therefore all the eigenvalues of I4 must be real. As\nwe showed above, the realization of E7(7) within E8(8) coincides with the\nsingletonic oscillator realization of E7(7) [19]. The oscillator realization of\nE7(7) leads to an infinitely reducible unitary representation [19]. Hence the\nminimal representation of E8(8) will be infinitely reducible with respect to\nE7(7) \u00d7 SU (1, 1).\n4\n\nFor an excellent introduction the general theory of unitary representations of noncompact groups see [28].\n5\nHere we should note that in certain exceptional cases the eigenvalue of the quadratic\nCasimir operator may not uniquely label the unitary irreducible representation of SU (1, 1).\nIn such cases one needs to use additional labels such as the eigenvalues of L0 .\n\n\f17\n\nM.

They\nare distinguished by the value of j which is the eigenvalue of L0 on the\ncorresponding lowest weight vector.\n\n\f18\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\n4.2\n\nThe SU (2, 1) truncation of E8(8)\n\nTo give the decomposition of the minimal representation of E8(8) w.r.t. its\nE7(7) \u00d7 SL(2, R) subgroup we need to determine all possible eigenvalues\nof I4 (X, P ) within our realization. Since this determination appears to\nbe rather complicated, we shall study this question in a somewhat simpler setting by truncating E8(8) to a special subgroup. E8(8) has the subgroup E6(2) \u00d7 SU (2, 1), where E6(2) has the maximal compact subgroup\nSU (6) \u00d7 SU (2). It is instructive to truncate our realization to the SU (2, 1)\nsubgroup, which is one of the minimal subgroups that admit a non-trivial\n5-grading. This is achieved by introducing coordinate x and momentum px\ncorresponding to the symplectic trace components of X ij and Pij , respectively:\n\u221a\nij\n2\n4 \u03a9ij X\n\u221a\n2 ij\n4 \u03a9 Pij ,\n\nx := \u2212\npx :=\n\n,\n(62)\n\nand throwing away the symplectic traceless components in our realization.\nThe matrix \u03a9ij is the symplectic metric defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u221211\n\u03a9ij :=\n(63)\n11 0\nand \u03a9ij is its inverse: \u03a9ij \u03a9jk = \u03b4ik . The generators x and px obey the\ncanonical commutation relation\n[x , px ] = i .\n\n(64)\n\nThe resulting expressions for the generators of SU (2, 1) are\nE :=\n\n1\n2\n\ny2 ,\n\nE\u2191 := y x ,\nE\u2193 := y px ,\nH :=\n\n1\n2 (y py\n\n+ py y)\n\nA := \u2212 43 (x2 + p2x )\nF\u2191 := \u2212xpy \u2212 12 y \u22121 (xpx x + p3x ) ,\nF\u2193 := px py \u2212 12 y \u22121 (px xpx + x3 ) ,\nF\n\n:=\n\n1 2\n2 py\n\n+ 81 y \u22122 (x2 + p2x )2 \u2212 18 y \u22122 ,\n\n(65)\n\n\f19\n\nM. G\u00fcnaydin et al.\n\nThe 5-grading in the above basis is with respect to H which is the noncompact dilatation generator. To understand the resulting representation of\nSU (2, 1) it is useful to go to the basis in which the Lie algebra of SU (2, 1)\nhas a 3-grading w.r.t. the compact U (1) generator that commutes with the\nSU (2) subgroup.\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nL\u2212\nJi\nL+\nSU (2, 1) =\n\u2295\n\u2295\n(66)\nK\u2212\nJ0\nK+\nThe compact U (1) generator is\nJ0 =\n\n1\n2 (E\n\n+ F \u2212 23 A) = L0 \u2212 13 A\n\n(67)\n\nand the SU (2) generators are\nJ1 =\nJ2 =\nJ3 =\n\n1\n\u221a\n(E\u2191 + F\u2193 ) ,\n2 2\n1\n\u221a\n(E\u2193 + F\u2191 ) ,\n2 2\n1\n4 (E + F + 2 A) ,\n\n(68)\n\nwith the commutation relations\n[Ji , Jj ] = i \u01ebijk Jk ,\n\n(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3)\n\n[J0 , Ji ] = 0 .\n\n(69)\n\nThe grade \u00b11 generators are\nK\u00b1 = (E\u2191 \u2212 F\u2193 ) \u2213 i(E\u2193 \u2212 F\u2191 ) ,\nL\u00b1 =\n\n1\n2 (E\n\n\u2212 F \u2213 iH) ,\n\n(70)\n\nsatisfying\n[J0 , K\u00b1 ] = \u00b1K\u00b1 ,\n[J0 , L\u00b1 ] = \u00b1L\u00b1 .\n\n(71)\n\nMore explicitly we have\nK\u00b1 = {(y \u2213 ipy ) + 21 y \u22121 [1 + (x2 + p2x )]}(x \u2213 ipx ) ,\nL\u00b1 = { 14 (y \u2213 ipy )2 \u2212\n\n1 \u22122\n16 y [\u22121\n\n+ (x2 + p2x )2 ]}\n\n(72)\n\nThe generator J0 that determines the 3-grading of SU (2, 1) w.r.t. maximal compact subgroup SU (2)\u00d7U (1) is manifestly positive definite. In terms\nof the annihilation and creation operators ax , a\u2020x the generator J0 takes the\nform:\nJ0 = 14 {y 2 + p2y + y \u22122 Nx (Nx + 1) + 2Nx + 1}\n\n(73)\n\n\f20\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\nwhere Nx = a\u2020x ax is the number operator. This implies that the resulting\nunitary irreducible representations of SU (2, 1) must be of the lowest weight\ntype (positive energy). Now the quadratic Casimir operator of SU (2, 1) is\ngiven by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nC2 SU (2, 1) = 21 (EF + F E) \u2212 41 H 2 + 31 A2\n+ 14 (E\u2191 F\u2193 + F\u2193 E\u2191 ) + 14 (E\u2193 F\u2191 + F\u2191 E\u2193 )\n\n(74)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the generators we find that the the quadratic\nCasimir of SU (2, 1) becomes simply a c-number, namely\n\u0002\n\u0003\n3\n(75)\nC2 SU (2, 1) = \u2212 16\n\nwhich suggests that the representation may be irreducible. To have an irreducible representation the cubic Casimir must likewise reduce to a c-number.\nHowever, we can study the irreducibility of the representation without having to calculate the cubic Casimir. Since we know that our representation\nis of the lowest weight type we can use the fact that a unitary irrep of the\nlowest weight type is uniquely determined by a set of states |\u03a9i transforming\nirreducibly under the maximal compact subgroup SU (2)\u00d7 U (1) and that are\nannihilated by all the generators of grade \u22121 under the 3-grading. Thus we\nneed to find all such states that are annihilated by K\u2212 and L\u2212 :\n\u0011\n\u0010\nK\u2212 |\u03a9i = 2 ay + \u221a12 y \u22121 (Nx + 1) ax |\u03a9i = 0\n\u0011\n\u0010\nL\u2212 |\u03a9i = 12 a2y \u2212 12 y \u22122 Nx (Nx + 1) |\u03a9i = 0\n(76)\nand that transform irreducibly under the maximal compact subgroup SU (2)\u00d7\nU (1). The only normalizable state satisfying these conditions is the one particle excited state\na\u2020y |0i\n\n(77)\n\nwhere the vacuum state |0i is annihilated by both annihilation operators\nax |0i = 0\nay |0i = 0\n\n(78)\n\nThis state is a singlet of SU (2) and has the U (1) charge 1. This proves\nthat the minimal realization of SU (2, 1) obtained by truncation of the minimal representation of E8(8) is also irreducible.\nThe subgroup E7(7) \u00d7 SU (1, 1) of E8(8) under truncation to SU (2, 1)\nreduces to U (1) \u00d7 SU (1, 1). The generators of SU (1, 1) subgroup of SU (2, 1)\n\n\f21\n\nM. G\u00fcnaydin et al.\nare given by\nL+ =\n=\nL\u2212 =\n\n=\n\nL0 =\n=\n\n1\n2 (E \u2212 F \u2212 iH)\n1 \u22122\n{ 14 (y \u2212 ipy )2 \u2212 16\ny [\u22121 + (x2 + p2x )2 ]}\n1\n2 (E \u2212 F + iH)\n1 \u22122\n{ 14 (y + ipy )2 \u2212 16\ny [\u22121 + (x2 + p2x )2 ]}\n1\n2 (E + F )\n1 \u22122\n{ 41 (y 2 + p2y ) + 16\ny [\u22121 + (x2 + p2x )2 ]}\n\n(79)\n\nThey are therefore the analogs of the generators(45). The generator of U (1)\nthat commutes with SU (1, 1) is simply A. In this truncation the quartic\nE7(7) invariant reduces to\nI4 =\n\n2\n1\n16 [(x\n\n+ p2x )2 \u2212 1]\n\n(80)\n\nwhich can be written in terms of the annihilation and creation operators as\nI4 = 14 {(a\u2020x ax )(a\u2020x ax + 1)}\n\u221a\n\n(81)\n\u221a\n\nwith the (obvious) identifications ax = \u2212 42 \u03a9AB aAB and a\u2020x = 42 \u03a9AB aAB .\nSince the eigenvalues of the number operator a\u2020 a are non-negative integers n,\nthe eigenvalues of I4 are simply 41 n(n + 1). In fact the realization of SU (1, 1)\nin this case leads to unitary lowest weight representations of the type studied\nin [11]. For n = 0 we get the singleton irreps of SU (1, 1) corresponding to\nthe values j = 14 and 43 . Thus the minimal unitary representation of SU (2, 1)\ndecomposes into a discretely infinite set of irreps of SU (1, 1) labelled by the\neigenvalues of the U (1) generator which is the analog of the E7(7) subgroup\nof E8(8) for the SU (2, 1) truncation.\n\n5\n\nOutlook\n\nThe finite dimensional conformal group SU (1, 1) is well known to possess an\ninfinite dimensional extension (the Witt-Virasoro group). One may therefore\nask whether there exists a generalization of this fact to E8(8) . In other words,\ndoes there exist an infinite dimensional Lie algebra (or Lie superalgebra) that\ncontains the Witt-Virasoro algebra and E8(8) at the same time? While there\nappears to be no linear Lie algebra with this property (and no finite dimensional Lie superalgebra, either), an infinite dimensional non-linear algebra of\nW-type does exist. It is a nonlinear quasi-superconformal algebra denoted\nas QE8(8) [4]. The quasi-superconformal algebras in two dimensions were\nfirst introduced in[32] and further systematized in[3]. They were generalized\n\n\f22\n\nThe Minimal Unitary Representation of E8(8)\n\nin[33] where two infinite families of nonlinear quasi-superconformal algebras\nwere introduced. A classification of complex forms of quasi-superconformal\nalgebras was given in [15]. In [4] a complete classification and a unified\nrealization of the real forms of quasi-superconformal algebras were given.\nIn the infinite central charge limit the exceptional quasi-superconformal\nalgebra QE8(8) has the Lie algebra E8(8) as a maximal finite dimensional\nsimple Lie subalgebra. The realization of QE8(8) given in[4] involves 56\ndimension 1/2 bosons and a dilaton, which leads to a realization of E8(8)\nin the infinite central charge limit. It will be important to understand if\nthe resulting realization can be related to the one given here. Furthermore\none would like to know if one could use the methods of [4] to give a unified\nrealization of the unitary representations of non-compact groups that act as\nquasi-conformal groups as formulated in [18], thus generalizing our minimal\nrealization E8(8) to all such noncompact groups.\nAcknowledgments: We are grateful to B.
