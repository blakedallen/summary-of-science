In this paper based on ROSAT/PSPC data we investigate the emission measure profiles of a sample\nof hot clusters of galaxies (kT > 3.5 keV) in order to explain the differences between observed and theoretically\npredicted LX \u2013T relation. Looking at the form of the emission measure profiles as well as their normalizations\nwe find clear indication that indeed the profiles have similar shapes once scaled to the virial radius, however,\nthe normalization of the profiles shows a strong temperature dependence.

This relationship explains the observed LX \u2013T relation and reduces the scatter in\nthe scaled profiles by a factor of 2 when compared to the classical scaling. We interpret this finding as strong\nindication that the Mgas \u2013T relation in clusters deviates from classical scaling.\n\nKey words. Galaxies: clusters: general \u2013 Cosmology: observations, dark matter \u2013 X-rays: general\n\n1. Introduction\nThe simplest, purely gravitational, models of structure\nformation predict that galaxy clusters are self-similar in\nshape and that scaling laws relate each physical property\nto the cluster total mass M and redshift z (Kaiser 1986;\nNavarro et al. 1997; Teyssier et al. 1997; Eke et al.1998;\nBryan & Norman 1998). Self similarity applies to both the\ndark matter component and the hot intra-cluster medium\n(ICM). The virial theorem then yields the well known scaling relations:\nM\u03b4 \u221d T 3/2 (1 + z)\u22123/2\n\nR\u03b4 \u221d T 1/2 (1 + z)\u22123/2 .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere M\u03b4 is the total mass in the sphere of radius R\u03b4\ncorresponding to the overall over density \u03b4 and T is the\ncluster temperature. Assuming a constant gas mass fraction, the total gas mass then scales as Mgas \u221d T 3/2 and\nthe X\u2013ray luminosity as T 2 .\nThe comparison between observed clusters and theoretical predictions gives us insight into the physics that\ngoverns their formation and evolution. Vikhlinin et al.\n1999 recently found R \u221d T 0.57\u00b10.04 , which is close to the\npredicted scaling law. Both the gas density and temperature profiles of hot clusters (T > 4keV) do show regularity\n(Markevitch et al. 1998; Neumann & Arnaud 1999, hereafter paper I; Vikhlinin et al. 1999). The shapes of various clusters, once the radius is scaled to the virial radius,\nSend offprint requests to: D.M. Neumann\n\nlook remarkably similar outside the cooling flow region,\nsupporting the existence of an universal underlying dark\nmatter profile.\nHowever, clusters also deviate from the predicted scaling laws. The most remarkable deviation is the observed\nLX \u2013T relation. Different authors, studying different cluster samples, found LX \u221d T 2.9 (Arnaud & Evrard 1999;\nMarkevitch 1998; Allen & Fabian 1998) with a low dispersion, ruling out the theoretical relation LX \u221d T 2 . This\ndifference between the slopes of the observed and theoretical relations can be explained if i) the cluster shape\ndepends on the ICM temperature and/or ii) the gas mass\ntemperature relation deviates from predictions (Arnaud &\nEvrard 1999; Ponman et al. 1999). Non gravitational effects, like pre-heating by early galactic winds, could affect\nthe gas distribution shape (e.g Loewenstein 2000; Tozzi\n& Norman 2001) and have been proposed to explain the\nsteepening of the LX \u2013T relation (Kaiser 1991; Evrard &\nHenry 1991). However the observed structural similarity\nof hot clusters suggest that pre-heating plays an important role only for cool (T \u2264 3.5 keV) clusters (see also\nPonman et al. 1999, Lloyd-Davis et al. 2000).\nIn order to investigate further the observed LX \u2013T relation, we examine in this paper the emission measure\nprofiles of a sample of nearby hot clusters, for which the\neffect of pre-heating is a priori minimal. The shape and\nnormalization of the emission measure profiles are sensitive to both the cluster internal structure and the total gas mass. Comparing the profiles of clusters at different temperatures can provide more detailed information\nabout the cause of the discrepancy between the predicted\nand observed LX \u2013T relations. In this paper we adopt\nH0 = 50km/sec/Mpc and \u03a9m = 1.\n\n\f2\n\nD.M. Neumann, M. Arnaud: Self-similarity of clusters of galaxies and the LX \u2212 T relation\n\n2. The data\nThe emission measure profiles are from our previous work\n(Paper I), where the cluster sample and imagery data processing are described in detail. The cluster sample comprises Abell clusters (Abell, Corwin & Olowin 1989) in the\nredshift range 0.04 < z < 0.06, which were observed in\npointing mode with the ROSAT PSPC and provide good\nstatistics. Here we only consider the clusters in the subsample for which accurate temperature measurements exist from the literature (with kT > 3.7keV). The emission\nmeasure profiles are deduced from the observed surface\nbrightness profiles via Eq.3 in paper I.\nFor the LX \u2013T relation, we adopt here and in the following the relation derived by Arnaud & Evrard (1999):\nLX \u221d T 2.88\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is in good agreement with other works (Markevitch\n1998; Allen & Fabian 1998).\n\n3. Combining self-similarity and the observed\nLX \u2212 T -relation\n3.1. Dependence of X-ray luminosity and emission\nmeasure profile on gas mass and ICM structure\nLet us consider a cluster of extent R and temperature T .\nIts X-ray luminosity depends on its total gas mass (within\nradius R) and its internal structure as:\nLX \u221d\n\n2\nMgas\n\u039b(T )Q(T )\nR3\n\n(4)\n\n(see also Arnaud & Evrard 1999) where \u039b(T ) is the cooling\nfunction, which we will assume to be T 1/2 . Q(T ) is a form\nfactor which only depends on the shape of the gas density distribution (\u03c1gas (r)). Q(T ) is equal to h\u03c12gas i/h\u03c1gas i2 ,\nwhere the brackets denote the average over the whole cluster (see also Arnaud & Evrard 1999). If clusters are selfsimilar in shape, Q(T ) should be constant.\nThe emission measure along the line-of-sight at radius\nr is defined as:\nZ R 2\n2\nMgas\nng (x)xdx\n\u221a\n\u221d\nF (r/R, T )\n(5)\nEM (r) \u221d\nR5\nx2 \u2212 r2\nr\nF (r/R, T ) is again a dimensionless form function, which\nshould be independent of temperature if clusters are selfsimilar. According to the theoretical scaling laws, EM\nshould scale as T 1/2 .\n\n3.2. Does the ICM shape depend on temperature?\nIn Paper I, we already quantified the structural variation\nin the cluster sample. We derived the logarithmic ICM\ndensity gradient \u03b1 by fitting a \u03b2\u2013model to the data,\n\u03b1(r/R) = \u2212\n\nd log ng (r/R)\nd log(r/R)\n\n= 3 1+(r\u03b2c /r)2 .\n\n(6)\n\nand showed that the dispersion of \u03b1 is less than 20% at any\nscaled radius. The \u03b1 values, for two different scaled radii,\n\nFig. 1. The \u03b1 parameter (logarithmic density gradient)\nversus temperature. The crosses show \u03b1 at a scaled radius\nof r/R=0.3, the circles at r/R=0.6.\nare plotted versus cluster temperature in Fig.1. There is no\napparent correlation between \u03b1 and T , i.e no systematic\nvariation of shape with temperature.\nFig.2 shows the scaled emission measure profiles of the\ng (r/R) \u221d EM (r)/T 1/2 (upper panel), and\nclusters, EM\ntheir corresponding relative dispersion (lower panel). The\nscaling radius was fixed to R = r200 with the normalization from Evrard et al. (1996). Due to detection limits\nwe only consider radii r/R < 0.5, our sample becoming\nincomplete at larger radii. The dispersion of the profiles\nis significant (40% standard deviation) but stays constant\nwith radius. This again indicates that the profiles are essentially parallel (self similarity of form) but points towards a possible problem with the normalization scaling\nfactor. These features are also evident to the eye in the\nupper panel.\nWe will thus assume in the following a common shape\nfor all the clusters in the sample (i.e. Q(T ) and F (r/R, T )\nare constant) and study possible deviation from the theoretical Mgas \u2013T and R\u2013T relations.\n\n3.3. Temperature dependence of the gas mass\nWe now consider:\nR \u221d Tx\n\nand\n\nMgas \u221d T 3/2+y\n\n(7)\n\nFrom Eq. 3, Eq. 4 and Eq. 7, the x and y slopes must\nbe related by 3x \u2212 2y = 0.62 to account for the observed\nslope of the LX \u2212 T relation.\nIf we assume that x = 0.5 , corresponding to the classical R\u2013T relation1 , we derive y = 0.44 or Mgas \u221d T 1.94 .\nFrom Eq. 5, the emission measure scales in this case as\nEM \u221d T 1.38 , instead of EM \u221d T 1/2 . The scaled emission measure profiles, using this new scaling, are shown\nin Fig.3. Note that these rescaled profiles are simply the\n1\nAnother formal solution is y = 0, which implies x = 0.21.\nThis is in contradiction with the R \u2212 T relation found by\nVikhlinin et al. (1999). Therefore we discard this possibility\nin the following.\n\n\fD.M. Neumann, M. Arnaud: Self-similarity of clusters of galaxies and the LX \u2212 T relation\n\nFig. 2.

Although this general agreement was not\nunexpected, since all these studies are based on ROSAT\n\n\f4\n\nD.M. Neumann, M. Arnaud: Self-similarity of clusters of galaxies and the LX \u2212 T relation\n\nsurface brightness data, it is not entirely trivial. Our evidence of a steeper than predicted Mgas \u2013T relation relies on\nstructural and scaling properties of the emission measure\nprofiles, guided by the independently measured LX \u2013T relation, while the analysis in previous works is more global,\nbased on the integrated density profiles.\nMohr & Evrard (1997) found a tight correlation between the X-ray isophotal radius and the temperature\nwith RI \u221d T 0.93\u00b10.11 . This relation is steeper than the\ntheoretical expectation, RI \u221d T 2/3 , for self similar clusters\nwith \u03b2 = 2/3 (Mohr et al. 1999). They interpret their finding as evidence for structural variation with temperature.\nHowever, our study indicates that this steepening (for\nclusters with kT > 4 keV) originates from systematic deviation of the profile normalization from the theoretical scaling with T. For a \u03b2\u2013model , the X-ray surface brightness\nprofiles at large radii varies as I(r) \u221d EM0 (r/Rc )1\u22126\u03b2 ,\nwhere Rc is the core radius and EM0 the central emission\nmeasure. For self similar clusters Rc \u221d R\u03b4 \u221d T 1/2 and\n1/3\nRI scales as EM0 T 1/2 (for \u03b2 = 2/3). If EM0 scales as\n1.38\nT\n, instead of T 1/2 , as derived here, we expect that RI\nscales as T 0.96 , as found by Mohr & Evrard (1997).\nThe steepening of the Mgas \u2013T relation has to be explained physically. It can arise from i) a variation of the\ngas mass fraction fgas with temperature and/or ii) a deviation of the total mass versus T relation from the theoretical scaling law.\nIf the modeling of dark matter clustering is correct\nand the ICM is in hydrostatic equilibrium, the latter possibility would imply that the X-ray mean temperature\nis a biased indicator of the virial temperature. For instance relativistic particles creating radio halos could contribute to the ICM pressure. If the strengths or quantity of\nthese particles is a function of temperature as indicated by\nColafrancesco (1999) it might explain the deviation from\nthe M \u2212 T relation. Departure from isothermality could\nalso bias the temperature TX measured from single temperature fits from global cluster X\u2013ray spectra. Numerical\nsimulations (Mathiesen & Evrard 2001; Bialek et al. 2001)\nsuggest a slight steepening of the M \u2212 TX relation with\nM \u221d TX1.6\u22121.7 . New X-ray observatories such as XMM or\nChandra will be able to investigate this possibility in detail.\nThe effect of pre-heating on the Mgas \u2013T relation was\nstudied recently by Bialek et al. (2001). Numerical simulations with initial entropy level consistent with the observations of Lloyd-Davis et al. (2000), predict a steepening of\nthe Mgas \u2013T relation, typically Mgas \u221d T 1.90\u00b10.07 , which\nis coherent with our results. The M-T relation obtained\nfrom simulations with and without pre-heating is similar.\nHowever, in pre-heating models, the Mgas \u2013T relation becomes steeper than the M \u2212 T relation, due to systematic\nvariations of fgas with T. However in the work by Bialek\net al. (2001) only 7 clusters have temperatures above 3.5\nkeV, with a large scatter in the fgas \u2013T relation (figure\n13, their work). Larger samples of simulated hot clusters\nand more detailed studies of their internal shape are necessary to see if pre-heating can contribute to the bias in\n\nthe Mgas \u2013T relation via fgas variation, without introducing structural variations, which is inconsistent with the\nobservations.\n\n5. Conclusion\nStudying the emission measure profiles of a sample of clusters (kT > 3.5keV) we found a strong indication that the\nMgas \u2013T relation of hot clusters deviates from theoretical\nexpectations. Our results suggest Mgas \u221d T 1.94 . This relationship together with the fact that clusters show selfsimilar profiles can explain the observed LX \u2013T relation,\nwhich also differs from theoretical expectations.\nThis result is in agreement with previous work such\nas Mohr et al. (1999) or Vikhlinin et al. (1999), based\non the direct measurement of Mgas in clusters. However,\nour study is more sensitive to deviations from the predicted Mgas \u2013T relation since the emission measure is, with\n2\nEM \u221d Mgas\n, strongly coupled to the gas mass content.\nObservations from XMM-Newton or Chandra of the temperature structure are required to assess whether the total\nmass also diverges from the predicted scalings.\nAcknowledgements.
