In addition to energy and angular momentum about the symmetry axis, there exists a third nontrivial constant of motion\nquadratic in the momenta. The constant was first discovered by Euler (1760, 1764) for two-dimensional (meridional)\nmotion, and the problem is known as the Euler problem\n(Lukyanov, Emeljanov, & Shirmin 2005). Lagrange (1766)\nextended Euler's solution to three-dimensional motion and\nmade a further generalization by allowing a Hookian (spring)\ncenter to be included between the two Newtonian (gravitational) centers. This generalization is known as the Lagrange\n\nproblem (cf. Lukyanov et al. 2005). The problem was further\nstudied by Jacobi (2009) using separation of variables of the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates.\nThe literature regarding the problem of two fixed centers is surveyed by Lukyanov et al. (2005) and the orbits\nare studied in \u00d3'Math\u00fana (2008). The quadratic2 constant\nhas been studied by several authors using the HamiltonJacobi approach (St\u00e4ckel 1890; Whittaker 1989; Eddington\n1915; Kuzmin 1956; Lynden-Bell 1962; de Zeeuw 1985a,b,c).\nIf one considers the distance between the two centers to\nbe imaginary, then one obtains a potential separable in\noblate spheroidal coordinates. This is known in satellite\ngeodesy as the Vinti potential and has been used to approximate the gravitational field around the oblate earth\n(Vinti 1960, 1963, 1969, 1971; Vinti et al. 1998). A further\ngeneralization is possible by relaxing equatorial plane symmetry. In the oblate case, this is accomplished by consider-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: charalampos.markakis@uni-jena.de\nFollowing terminology in Misner et al. (1973), a Newtonian\ndipole will refer to a pair of fixed positive-mass centers each of\nwhich creates a Newtonian gravitational field\n1\n\n2\n\nA quadratic constant will refer to a constant quadratic in the\nmomenta\n\n\f2\n\nC. Markakis\n\ning two Newtonian fixed centers with complex-conjugated\nmasses located at constant imaginary distance. The resulting Darboux\u2013Gredeaks potential has been used to approximate the gravitational field around other oblate planets (Aksenov, Grebenikov, & Demin 1963, Lukyanov et al.\n2005).\nLynden-Bell (2003) has provided a simple and elegant\nderivation of the quadratic constant in the Euler problem,\nby noting that the kinetic part of the constant is the dot\nproduct of the angular momenta about the two fixed centers of attraction. He also provided a generalization of the\nconstant for a class of potentials that satisfy a certain integrability condition. It will be demonstrated in section 2.6\nthat this class is essentially that of the Lagrange problem,\nthat is, it amounts to the addition of a Hooke term to the\npotential.\nIsrael (1970) and Keres (1967) have demonstrated\nthat the dipole field of the Euler problem can be regarded as the Newtonian analogue of the Kerr solution\nin general relativity. Following Misner's suggestion to seek\nanalogues of the quadratic constant in Newtonian dipole\nfields, Carter discovered his quadratic constant of motion in Kerr spacetime by separation of variables (Carter\n1968, 1977; Misner, Thorne, & Wheeler 1973). The analogy has been further elucidated by Lynden-Bell (2003),\nFlanagan & Hinderer (2007) and Will (2009).\nCarter (1968, 2009b, 2010) also discovered a generalization of the Kerr solution with a non-zero cosmological constant, describing a rotating black hole in four dimensional\nde Sitter (or anti de Sitter) backgrounds. Carter's quadratic\nconstant of motion exists for this class of spacetimes as well\nand has been used to solve for the orbits in terms of hypergeometric functions (Kraniotis 2004, 2005, 2011). It will\nbe shown in section 2.6 that the quadratic constant of the\nLagrange two-center problem is the Newtonian analogue of\nthe Carter constant in a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime.\nThe main motivation behind the study of integrability\nin stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields is to astrophysically test the Kerr solution and the no-hair theorem\nfor black holes. The Kerr solution owes its integrability to\nthe existence of the Carter constant, which is very useful\nfor analyzing the orbit of a small black hole around a\nmassive black hole. Detecting gravitational waves from\nthese extreme mass ratio inspirals is a prime goal of the\nproposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA/eLISA\n(Jennrich et al. 2011; Amaro et al. 2012a,b). The influence\nof gravitational radiation reaction on the evolution of the\nCarter constant has been used to obtain the gravitational\nwaveforms from orbits around Kerr black holes. As demonstrated by Ryan (1995) (see also Sotiriou & Apostolatos\n2005), by measuring the mass, spin and at least one more\nnon-trivial moment of the gravitational field of a black hole\ncandidate via gravitational wave observations, one can test\nthe validity of the no-hair theorem. Such tests have been\nproposed for the supermassive black hole at the centre of the\nMilky Way, Sgr A*, as reviewed, for example, by Johannsen\n(2012). Work by Glampedakis & Babak (2006); Gair et al.\n(2008); Psaltis & Johannsen (2009); Johannsen & Psaltis\n(2010a,b, 2011); Psaltis & Johannsen (2011, 2012);\nCollins & Hughes (2004); Hughes (2006); Dubovsky et al.\n(2007); Vigeland & Hughes (2010); Vigeland (2010);\n\nVigeland et al. (2011); Johannsen & Psaltis (2013) is a\nfraction of the vast literature.\nIn order to provide a systematic framework for testing the Kerr solution, a number of the above articles have\nintroduced \"bumpy\" black-hole spacetimes, which are stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum spacetimes with arbitrary\nmultipole moments (deviating from those of Kerr), in terms\nof which the stellar orbits and their associated observables\nare parametrized. This parametrization allows one to astrophysically test the relationship between the multipole\nmoments, and thus probe the validity of the Kerr solution\nin general relativity. Because the arbitrariness of the moments leads to loss of the Carter constant, some authors\nhave sought other stationary axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes that may be integrable, i.e. that admit a generalized\nCarter constant (Brink 2008a,b, 2010a,b, 2011). However,\nthere exist conflicting claims in the literature about whether\nsuch spacetimes actually exist (Mirshekari & Will 2010;\nKruglikov & Matveev 2011; Lukes-Gerakopoulos 2012).\nThe subject of the present article is a systematic approach towards resolving such conflicts and elucidating the\nrelation between the no-hair theorem and integrability of\nmotion in the Newtonian regime. We use a direct approach\n(Hietarinta 1987) to systematically search for a nontrivial\nconstant polynomial in the momenta. This approach consists of directly solving the Killing equations and certain\nintegrability conditions. In section 2 we show that the constant in the Euler and Lagrange two-center problems is the\nunique quadratic constant for motion around a stationary\naxisymmetric massive object with equatorial reflection symmetry. Although this result is implicit in other work (cf.\nKalnins et al. 2009, 2010; Kalnins 2012) no explicit proof of\nuniqueness3 existed in the literature prior to that of Will\n(2009). The merits of the systematic procedure outlined\nhere are that it provides a complete proof (as it involves\nno assumptions regarding separability or the form of the\nquadratic constant) and that it is generalizable to more complicated systems with higher-order Killing tensors, as illustrated in subsequent sections. In section 2.7 the quadratic\nconstant is shown to be Noether-related. In section 3 we\nconsider the next natural generalization, a constant quartic\nin the momenta. Using the direct approach, we show that\nno such constant exists for stationary axisymmetric vacuum\npotentials in Newtonian gravity.\nExtrapolating these uniqueness and non-existence theorems into the relativistic regime provides highly suggestive evidence in favour of the conjecture that a stationary\naxisymmetric vacuum spacetime is integrable if and only\nif it belongs to the Kerr (or Kerr-de Sitter) class. Besides\nthe theoretical implications, this is important from an onservational/astronomical point of view. For example, this\nconjecture is a working assumption of a number of articles discussing astrophysical tests of the Kerr black hole\nsolution (Apostolatos et al. 2009; Lukes-Gerakopoulos et al.\n2010; Lukes et al. 2010; Contopoulos et al. 2011). Conclu-\n\n3 The advantage of the derivation in Will (2009), based on a multipole expansion, is that it establishes uniqueness among all stationary axisymmetric potentials, but this uniqueness is restricted\nto invariants constructed from a certain combination of the linear\nor angular momentum and position vectors.\n\n\fConstants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields\nsions, and a discussion of this matter, are given in section\n4.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nINVARIANTS QUADRATIC IN THE\nMOMENTA\nKilling equation and integrability conditions\n\nThe motion of a test particle in a Newtonian gravitational\nfield \u03a6 is independent of the particle mass, so for simplicity\nwe can set the latter equal to unity. This motion is described\nby an action functional\nZ t2\nS[x, p] =\ndt[pi \u1e8bi \u2212 H(x, p)]\n(1)\nt1\n\ni\n\nwhere position x and momentum pi are treated as independent variables,\nH(x, p) =\n\n1 ij\ng (x)pi pj + \u03a6(x)\n2\n\n(2)\n\nis the Hamiltonian, g ij is the inverse of the Euclidian metric\ngij in E3 and summation over repeated indices is implied.\nIndices are raised and lowered with this metric throughout\nthe paper. Unless otherwise noted, we will be using Cartesian coordinates, so that gij = \u03b4ij where \u03b4ij is the Kronecker\ndelta. The Cartesian components of the canonical momentum pi = gij \u1e8bj will then coincide with those of the kinetic\nmomentum \u1e8bi .\nSpatial translations and rotations in E3 are generated\nby the vector fields\nXk = ek ,\n\nRi =\n\n\u03b5kji xj ek\n\n(3)\n\nwhere ek = {x\u0302, \u0177, \u1e91} are Cartesian basis vectors and \u03b5ijk\nis the Levi-Civita tensor. We are interested in orbits of a\ntest particle in the vicinity of a stationary and axisymmetric massive object, an object whose gravitational potential\nsatisfies\n\u2202t \u03a6 = 0\n\n(4)\nk\n\n\u00a3\u03c6 \u03a6 = \u03c6 \u2202k \u03a6 = (x\u2202y \u2212 y\u2202x )\u03a6 = 0\n\n(5)\n\nHere, \u00a3\u03c6 denotes the Lie-derivative along the Killing vector\nfield\n\u03c6 \u2261 Rz = x \u0177 \u2212 y x\u0302\n\n(6)\n\nthat generates rotations about the z-axis (the axis of symmetry). By virtue of Noether's theorem, invariance with respect\nto time translations and azimuthal rotations implies respectively conservation of the Hamiltonian H and the component\nLz = \u03c6i pi = Rzi pi = x py \u2212 y px\n\n(7)\n\nof angular momentum. Rotations about the x and y axes,\ngenerated by the vector fields Rx and Ry are not considered\nsymmetries of the problem, so the components Lx = Rxi pi\nand Ly = Ryi pi of angular momentum are not generally conserved. For example, the potential around a rotating massive\nobject (such as a star or planet) in hydrostationary equilibrium, may be expected to be axisymmetric, but not spherically symmetric, due to the rotationally induced deformation. Without further symmetries, H and Lz are the only\nindependent integrals of motion and, since the motion of\n\n3\n\ntest particles is three-dimensional, the problem is in general\nnon-integrable. Nevertheless, one may seek special types of\nstationary axisymmetric potentials that admit a third nontrivial constant of motion and are therefore integrable.\nIf one seeks a constant of motion linear in the momenta,\nthen one is quickly led to rotational or translational symmetries as the only choices, which have been already exhausted\nas explained above. The next natural step is to seek potentials admitting a nontrivial constant of motion quadratic in\nthe momenta,\nI(x, p) = K ij (x)pi pj + K(x),\n\n(8)\n\nij\n\nwhere the symmetric tensor K and the scalar K are functions of position. The above quantity is conserved iff it commutes with the Hamiltonian, in the sense of a vanishing\nPoisson bracket:\ndI\n\u2202I \u2202H\n\u2202I \u2202H\n= {I, H} \u2261\n\u2212\n= 0.\n(9)\ndt\n\u2202xk \u2202pk\n\u2202pk \u2202xk\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian (2) and the ansatz (8) into the\nabove Poisson bracket yields\n{I, H} = \u2202 k K ij pi pj pk + (\u2202 j K \u2212 2K jk \u2202k \u03a6)pj\n\n(10)\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202xk\n\nwhere \u2202k =\nIn order that this Poisson bracket vanish for\nall orbits, the following necessary and sufficient conditions\n(Boccaletti & Pucacco 2003) must be satisfied:\n\u2202 (k K ij) = 0\nj\n\n(11)\njk\n\n\u2202 K = 2K \u2202k \u03a6,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere parentheses denote symmetrization over the enclosed\nindices; that is, A(ij) = 12 (Aij + Aji ). Eq. (11) is a Killing\nequation in Euclidian space; a solution K ij to the above\nequations will be referred to as a Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor\n(Carter 1977). From Eq. (12), we obtain a necessary, but\nnot sufficient, integrability condition\n1 [i j]\n\u2202 \u2202 K=0\n(13)\n2\nwhere square brackets denote antisymmetrization over the\nenclosed indices, that is A[ij] = 21 (Aij \u2212 Aji ).\nOur assumptions of stationarity and axisymmetry already guarantee the existence of two independent solutions\nto the above set of equations. First, the metric itself is already a Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor, because equations (11)\u2013(13)\nare satisfied by K ij = 12 g ij = 12 \u03b4 ij , K = \u03a6, and the associated conserved quantity is simply the Hamiltonian (2).\nSecondly, the above equations are also satisfied by the reducible Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor K ij = \u03c6i \u03c6j , with K = 0,\nimplying conservation of the quantity L2z . This second case\nis reducible to the linear invariant (7) associated with the\naxial Killing vector \u03c6i . We now explore the possibility of\na third independent solution that can render the problem\nintegrable.\nThe conditions (11)\u2013(13) suggest a systematic method\n(Hietarinta 1987) for obtaining integrable potentials and the\nassociated invariants of motion:\n\u2202 [i (K j]k \u2202k \u03a6) =\n\n(i) The tensor K ij may be computed by solving Eq. (11)\nsubject to the symmetries of the problem.\n(ii) With this tensor known, the integrability condition\n(13) provides a key restriction on the Newtonian potential \u03a6.\nOne may solve this condition (e.g. via a multipole method)\nto obtain a family of integrable potentials.\n\n\f4\n\nC. Markakis\n\n(iii) Given a family of potentials \u03a6 that satisfy this integrability condition, one may obtain the scalar function K\nby integrating the components of Eq. (12).\nWith this method as the basis of our analysis, we proceed to carry out the prescribed steps in more detail.\n2.2\n\nAxy = Axz = Ayz = Axx \u2212 Ayy = 0\n\nOne may straightforwardly solve Eq. (11) by noticing that\nthe solution must be polynomial in the Cartesian coordinates. This is easily seen in one or two dimensions (c.f. Appendix A) and can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions\nand tensor rank (Horwood 2008). In three dimensions, Eq.\n(11) constitutes an overdetermined system of ten equations\nfor the six independent components of the symmetric tensor\nK ij . As shown by Horwood (2008), the most general solution to this system is a sum of symmetrized products of the\ntranslational and rotational vectors (3):\nK = K ij Xi \u2297Xj = Aij Xi \u2297Xj + 2Bij Xi \u2297Rj + C ij Ri \u2297Rj\n(14)\nThe components K ij of the tensor K are polynomial of second order in the Cartesian coordinates xi and can be written\nas\nK\n\nij\n\nk(i j)\n\nkl x\n\nij\n\n(ij)\n\n= A + 2B\n\nij\n\n(ij)\n\n\u03b5\n\nl\n\n+C\n\nmn i\n\n\u03b5\n\nj\n\nkm \u03b5 ln x\n\nk l\n\nx\n\n(15)\n\nwhere A = A , C = C\nare symmetric 3 \u00d7 3 constant\nmatrices and Bij is a nonsymmetric 3 \u00d7 3 constant matrix.\nWhile a superficial counting results in 21 independent coefficients, the actual number of independent coefficients is 20.\nThis is because the main diagonal elements of Bij appear in\nK ij only in the combinations Bxx \u2212Byy , Byy \u2212Bzz , Bzz \u2212Bxx\nand the sum of these three terms is zero.\n2.3\n\nIsometries\n\nOne may considerably reduce the number of unknown coefficients by imposing known symmetries of the action functional S on the orbital invariant I.\n(i) Stationarity corresponds to invariance of S under the\ngroup action of (R, +) which represents time translations\nt \u2192 t + \u03b4t. This symmetry has already been taken into\naccount, since all quantities have no explicit dependence on\ntime t and an additive term \u2202I/\u2202t has been set to zero in\nEq. (9).\n(ii) Axisymmetry corresponds to invariance of S under\nthe group action of SO(2) which represents infinitesimal rotations {x, y, z} \u2192 {x + y \u03b4\u03c6, y \u2212 x \u03b4\u03c6, z} about the z-axis.\nThis symmetry is generated by the Killing vector (6) and\nmay be imposed by requiring\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nI=0\n(16)\n\u2212 py\n\u2212y\n+ px\nx\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\u2202py\n\u2202px\nWith I given by Eq. (8), the above condition can be shown\nto be equivalent to the requirement that the functions K ij\nand K remain unchanged under rotations about the z-axis:\n\u00a3\u03c6 K ij = \u03c6k \u2202k K ij \u2212 K kj \u2202k \u03c6i \u2212 K ki \u2202k \u03c6j = 0\nk\n\n\u00a3\u03c6 K = \u03c6 \u2202 k K = 0\n\n(19)\n\nBxz = Bzx = Byz = Bzy\n\nRank-two Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensors\n\nij\n\nthe Hamiltonian, which is seen by the fact that these equations are also satisfied by replacing I, K ij , K with H, 12 \u03b3 ij , \u03a6\nin the above three equations respectively. Substituting the\ngeneral solution (15) into Eq. (17) yields the axisymmetry\nconstraints\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nEvidently, the symmetries (16), (17), (18) are inherited from\n\nC\n\nxy\n\n= Bxx \u2212 Byy = Bxy + Byx = 0\n\n(20)\n\n= C xz = C yz = C xx \u2212 C yy = 0\n\n(21)\n\n(iii) Further simplification is possible by assuming equatorial plane reflection symmetry. This corresponds to invariance of S under the discrete group action of Z2 which represents reflections {x, y, z, px , py , pz } \u2192 {x, y, \u2212z, px , py , \u2212pz }\nabout the equatorial plane. (This assumption is not necessary for integrability, c.f. Lynden-Bell (2003), but we retain\nit for simplicity). Imposing this symmetry on the invariant\n(8) leads to the constraints\nAxz = Ayz = 0\nB\n\nxx\n\nC\n\nxz\n\n=B\n\nyy\n\n=B\n\n(22)\nzz\n\n(23)\n\nBxy = Byx = 0\n=C\n\nyz\n\n(24)\n\n=0\n\n(25)\n\nNote that the constraints (19)\u2013(21) and (22)\u2013(25) are\nindependent, since axisymmetry and reflection symmetry\nare separate assumptions. Imposing these two sets of constraints on the tensor (15) yields\nK = Ayy (Xx \u2297Xx + Xy \u2297Xy ) + Azz Xz \u2297Xz\n+ C yy (Rx \u2297Rx + Ry \u2297Ry ) + C zz Rz \u2297Rz\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2\ny + z2\n\u2212xy\n\u2212xz\nx2 + z 2\n\u2212yz \uf8f8\n= C yy \uf8ed \u2212xy\n2\n\u2212xz\n\u2212yz\nx + y2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0 0 0\nyy\nzz\nyy \uf8ed\n0 0 0 \uf8f8+A \uf8ed 0\n+ (A \u2212 A )\n0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\ny\n\u2212xy 0\nx2\n0 \uf8f8\n+ (C zz \u2212 C yy ) \uf8ed \u2212xy\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0 \uf8f8\n1\n(26)\n\nThis is the most general solution to Eq. (11) consistent with the symmetry (R, +) \u00d7 SO(2) \u00d7 Z2 . For clarity, we set \u03ba \u2261 C yy , \u03bb \u2261 Azz , \u03bc \u2261 C zz \u2212 C yy and a \u2261\np\n(Azz \u2212 Ayy )/C yy . The parameter a is allowed to be real or\nimaginary and will be shown to depend on the gravitational\nsource. (This reparametrization entails no loss of generality,\nas the sign of (Azz \u2212 Ayy )/C yy is unrestricted. We have also\nexcluded the possibility of vanishing C yy with nonvanishing\n(Azz \u2212 Ayy ). This case would lead to a Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor (Azz \u2212 Ayy )\u03b4zi \u03b4zj , reducible to a Killing vector \u03b4zi that\ngenerates translations along the z-axis. But this is not a\nsymmetry of the problem by assumption, i.e. we have excluded cylindrical symmetry.) The above solution may then\nbe written as\nK ij = \u03baAij + \u03bb g ij + \u03bc \u03c6i \u03c6j\n\n(27)\n\n\fConstants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields\nwhere gij = \u03b4ij is the Euclidian metric, \u03c6 is the axial Killing\nvector (6),\nAij = \u03b4 kl Rki Rlj + ai aj \u2212 a2 g ij\n\n= (r 2 g ij \u2212 xi xj ) \u2212 (a2 g ij \u2212 ai aj )\n\n= g mn \u03b5ikm \u03b5j ln (xk xl \u2212 ak al )\n=\n\ng mn \u03b5ikm \u03b5j ln (xk\n\nk\n\nl\n\nl\n\n+ a )(x \u2212 a )\n\n2.4\n\nIntegrability condition: no-hair relation\n\nAlthough the solution (28) satisfies Eq. (11) and the symmetries of the problem, it does not lead to a conserved quantity\nunless the condition (12) is satisfied. Our next step is thus\nto use the integrability condition (13) of Eq. (12) to obtain\na family of potentials \u03a6 for which Aij leads to a conserved\nquantity. The Newtonian gravitational field around an axisymmetric object is completely characterized by a set of\nmass multipole moments {ML }, by means of the expansion\n\u03a6=\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\nML\nP (z/r)\nL+1 L\nr\nL=0\n\n(29)\n\nwhere PL are the Legendre polynomials. This expansion is\nconsistent with a stationary axisymmetric vacuum potential\nthat vanishes at infinity.\nIf one also requires equatorial plane reflection symmetry, then the potential \u03a6 must be an even function of z, so\nthe odd moments M1 , M3 , . . . must vanish. Then, substituting K ij = Aij and \u03a6, as given by eqs. (28) and (29), into\nthe integrability condition (13), we find by straightforward\nalgebra that the latter is satisfied if and only if the even\nmultipole moments satisfy the recursion relation:\n2\n\nML+2 = a ML\n\n(L = 0, 2, . . .)\n\n(30)\n\n\u03a6=\u2212\n\nM0\n\u03c1 + a2 z 2 /\u03c13\n\n(33)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is an ellipsoidal coordinate defined by\nx2 + y 2\nz2\n+\n=1\n\u03c1 2 + a2\n\u03c12\n\n(34)\n\nVinti (1960, 1963, 1969, 1971); Vinti et al. (1998) has shown\nthat the above potential is the most general solution to\nthe three dimensional Laplace equation that seperates the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation in oblate spheroidal coordinates.\n(A similar statement can be made for the potential (32) in\nprolate spheroidal coordinates). Vinti's potential has been\nfrequently used in satellite geodesy to approximate the gravitational field around the oblate earth.\nWe have so far shown that the solutions (28) and (32)\nare the unique stationary, axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric, vacuum solutions to eqs. (11) and (13). (Note that\nwe have excluded the possibility of cylindrical symmetry as\nwe are interested in the gravitational field of massive objects\nwith compact support near the origin.) This completes step\n(ii) of our procedure.\n2.5\n\nExistence and uniqueness of the quadratic\ninvariant\n\nThe last step towards obtaining an invariant is to obtain\nthe scalar contribution K to the invariant (8). This is done\nby solving the condition (12) with K ij = Aij and \u03a6 given\nrespectively by eqs. (28) and (29). The solution K = A is\nobtained by integrating the x component of Eq. (12) with\nrespect to x, or the y component with respect to y. Up to\nsome additive constant, we find\nZ\nZ\nA = 2 dx Aix \u2202i \u03a6 = 2 dy Aiy \u2202i \u03a6\n= p\n\nM0 a(z + a)\nM0 a(z \u2212 a)\n\u2212p\nx2 + y 2 + (z + a)2\nx2 + y 2 + (z \u2212 a)2\n\n(35)\n\nFinally, substituting Eq. (28) into (8) and using the Lagrange identity, the quadratic invariant is written\nI = Aij pi pj + A\n\nor, equivalently,\nML = aL M0\n\nthree body problem: a test mass moving in the gravitational\nfield of two point sources, each of mass M0 /2, fixed at positions \u00b1a \u1e91.\nIn the oblate case, the replacement a \u2192 i a (where i2 =\n\u22121) allows one to write the above potential as\n\n(28)\n\n\u221a\nis a new nontrivial Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor, r = xk xk is a\nradial coordinate and ai = a\u03b4zi are the components of the\nvector a = a \u1e91. With \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc regarded as arbitrary coefficients, the general solution (27) is a linear combination of\nthree independent solutions: the known Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensors \u03b3 ij = \u03b4 ij and \u03c6i \u03c6j , associated with stationarity and axisymmetry, and a third independent solution Aij associated\nwith a Noether symmetry to be discussed later. The above\nexpression gives the most general rank-two Killing tensor in\nstationary-axisymmetric vacuum potentials. This completes\nstep (i) of the prescribed procedure.\n\n5\n\n(L = 0, 2, . . .).\n\n(31)\n\nwhere aL denotes the L-th power of a in the above two\nequations. This relation is analogous to the \"no-hair\" relation for Kerr black holes (Israel 1970; Hansen 1974; Will\n2009). All nonzero multipoles are determined by the mass\nM0 and the parameter a. If a is real (imaginary) then the\nquadrupole moment M2 = a2 M0 is positive (negative) and\nthe expansion (29) describes the field of a prolate (oblate)\nobject. Summing the Legendre series (29) using Eq. (31)\nyields (Trahanas 2004; Will 2009)\nM0 /2\nM0 /2\n\u03a6 = \u2212p\n\u2212p\n2\n2\n2\n2\nx + y + (z \u2212 a)\nx + y 2 + (z + a)2\n\n(32)\n\nIn the prolate case, the above potential is that of Euler's\n\n= r 2 |p|2 \u2212 |x * p|2 \u2212 (a2 |p|2 \u2212 |a * p|2 ) + A\n\n= |x \u00d7 p|2 \u2212 |a \u00d7 p|2 + A\n\n= [(x + a) \u00d7 p] * [(x \u2212 a) \u00d7 p] + A\n\n(36)\n\nwith A given by Eq. (35). The above expression holds for\nthe prolate case, a = |a|. In the oblate case, a = i |a|,\nthe above expression still gives a true result. In the spherically symmetric limit, a \u2192 0, the above invariant reduces\nto I \u2192 |x \u00d7 p|2 which is a natural consequence of conserved\nnet angular momentum. The first integrals H, Lz , I are independent and in involution (that is, {H, Lz } = 0, {H, I} = 0\nand {I, Lz } = 0). Thus, the system is Liouville-integrable.\nWe have shown that the potential (33) is the unique stationary, axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric, vacuum potential admitting a nontrivial constant of motion quadratic\n\n\f6\n\nC. Markakis\n\nin the momenta, Eq. (36). The potential (33) can be considered the Newtonian analogue (Keres 1967; Israel 1970;\nLynden-Bell 2003; Will 2009) of the Kerr solution in general relativity. The analogy is manifest when the Kerr metric is written in Kerr-Schild coordinates (Kerr & Schild\n1965). The associated constant of motion is traditionally obtained by separating the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in BoyerLindquist coordinates (Carter 1968; Misner et al. 1973). It\nwas in this way that Carter originally discovered his constant, following Misner's suggestion to seek analogies to the\nconstant (36) in Newtonian dipole fields. This analogy persists in the presence of a cosmological constant as demonstrated in the following section.\nAnother interesting property is the following: One may\ninterchange the roles of the metric gij and potential \u03a6 with\nthose of the Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor Aij and scalar field A\nrespectively. Then the momentum map is generated by I =\nAij pi pj +A (which plays the role of the Hamiltonian) and the\nquadratic constant of motion is given by H = 21 g ij pi pj + \u03a6.\nThis duality also exists in the relativistic case of the Kerr\nspacetime (Carter 2009a).\n2.6\n\nCosmological constant: analogy with a\nKerr-de Sitter spacetime\n\nOne may generalize the result of the previous section in\nvarious directions, by relaxing certain assumptions. The assumption that the motion is in vacuum may be relaxed by\nadding terms with a non-vanishing Laplacian to the multipole expansion (29) of the gravitational potential. For example, one may attempt to add a spherically symmetric\npower-law potential of the form r l . Doing so, and repeating the previous steps, leads to the same expression (28) for\nthe Killing tensor Aij as before. Direct substitution shows\nthat the integrability condition (13) is satisfied if and only\nif the moments {ML } satisfy the no-hair relation (30) and\nthe only power law term that can be added is proportional\nto r 2 . This leads to a potential\n\u03a6=\u2212 p\n\nM0 /2\nM0 /2\n\u2212p\nx2 + y 2 + (z + a)2\nx2 + y 2 + (z \u2212 a)2\n\n\u2212 \u039b(x2 + y 2 + z 2 )\n\n(37)\n\nIn the prolate case, with a real, the above potential is that\nof two force centers, with Newton's inverse square law of\ngravitational attraction supplemented by a linear cosmological constant (or Hooke) term. (Note that the last term in\nthe above equation may be regarded as the contribution of\na spring connecting the test particle to the origin or as the\ncontribution of two springs connecting the test particle to\nthe two centers at \u00b1a \u1e91). The associated constant of motion\nis given by Eq. (36) with\nA =p\n\nM0 a(z + a)\nM0 a(z \u2212 a)\n\u2212p\nx2 + y 2 + (z + a)2\nx2 + y 2 + (z \u2212 a)2\n\n+ 2\u039ba2 (x2 + y 2 )\n\n(38)\n\nIn the oblate case, with a imaginary, the last term may\nagain be interpreted as the contribution of a cosmological\nconstant. With the substitution a \u2192 i a, the potential (37)\ncan be naturally regarded as the Newtonian analogue of a\nKerr-de Sitter spacetime and the constant (38) as the analogue of the Carter constant in that spacetime (Carter 1968).\n\nFor this spacetime the metric has a tt component given by\ngtt = \u2212(1 + 2\u03a6) in Kerr-Schild coordinates, with \u03a6 given by\nEq. (37) and a replaced by i a.\nLynden-Bell (2003) provided a generalization of the\nquadratic constant (36) and the two-center potential (32).\nHis result holds for potentials satisfying a certain integrability condition, which takes the form of a wave equation,\n(\u2202 2 /\u2202r12 \u2212 \u2202 2 /\u2202r22 )(r1 r2 \u03a6) = 0 in his two-center coordinates\nr1,2 = r \u00b1 a (Lynden-Bell 2003, section 3). Assuming equatorial symmetry and substituting the multipole expansion\n(29) into this integrability condition, we recover the no-hair\nrelation (29) and the potential (32). If we attempt to add\npower law terms of the form r1l , r2l to the potential \u03a6 we\nfind that the only possibility is r12 + r22 = 2(r 2 + a2 ), giving\nrise to the potential (37) up to a constant. We infer that\nLynden-Bell's generalization accounts for the presence of a\ncosmological constant term, which gives rise to the Newtonian analogue of the Kerr-de Sitter spacetime discussed\nabove.\nThe direct approach employed here is more algorithmic and computationally intensive compared to other approaches (Lynden-Bell 2003; Will 2009). But the advantages\nof the direct approach are that it establishes uniqueness and\nthat it can be straightforwardly generalized to higher order\nor relativistic invariants. We have shown that the unique\nstationary, axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric potential\nadmitting an invariant quadratic in the momenta is given by\nEq. (37). The assumption of equatorial symmetry may be relaxed (Lynden-Bell 2003) by dropping conditions (22)-(25),\nbut we do not pursue this here.\n\n2.7\n\nGeneralized Noether symmetry\n\nThe generalized Noether theorem may be stated as follows\n(Ioannou & Apostolatos 2004). Consider the \u01eb-family of infinitesimal transformations\nxi \u2192 xi\u01eb = xi + \u01eb K i (x, \u1e8b, t)\n\n(39)\n\nwhich depend on position and velocity, for a small parameter\n\u01eb.\nR If this family of transformations leaves the action S =\nL dt invariant, or, equivalently, changes the Lagrangian L\nby a total time derivative of some scalar K(x, t),\nL \u2192 L\u01eb = L \u2212 \u01eb\n\ndK\ndt\n\n(40)\n\nthen the quantity\nI=\n\n\u2202L i\nK +K\n\u2202 \u1e8bi\n\n(41)\n\nis a constant of motion. Since the family (39) of transformations is velocity-dependent, it is not generally considered a\nfamily of diffeomorphisms. Nevertheless, it is a generalized\nsymmetry of the action and Noether-related to an invariant\nof the form (41).\nConversely, if the quantity I is a constant of motion, then the \u01eb-family of transformations generated\nby K i (x, \u1e8b, t), obtained by solving the linear system\n(Ioannou & Apostolatos 2004)\n\u2202I\n\u22022L\nKi =\n,\n\u2202 \u1e8bi \u2202 \u1e8bj\n\u2202 \u1e8bj\nis a generalized symmetry of the action.\n\n(42)\n\n\fConstants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields\nThe motion of a test particle in a Newtonian graviational field can be obtained from the Lagrangian L(x, \u1e8b) =\n1\ng \u1e8bi \u1e8bj + \u03a6. If the motion admits a quadratic invariant\n2 ij\nI(x, \u1e8b) = Kij \u1e8bi \u1e8bj + K, then the inverse Noether theorem\n(42) implies that the \u01eb-family of transformations (39) generated by K i = K ij \u1e8bj is a generalized symmetry of the action.\nWe infer, for the problem of the previous section with K ij\ngiven by Eq. (27), that the action (1) is invariant under three\nfamilies of infinitesimal transformations:\n\n7\n\nLagrangian under time translations along the integral curves\nof a timelike Killing vector) is related to conservation of energy or Hamiltonian. Metric affinity (invariance of the action\nunder proper time translations) is related to conservation of\nthe magnitude of four-velocity (or the super-Hamiltonian)\nand is associated with the four-metric being a Killing tensor. Finally, a family of transformations analogous to those\nof case (iii) is related to the Carter constant of motion (cf.\nPadmanabhan 2010, page 381).\n\n(i) The Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor \u03c6i \u03c6j is Noether-related to\nthe family of transformations\nxi\u01eb = xi + \u01eb \u03c6i \u03c6j \u1e8bj = xi + \u01eb Lz \u03c6i\nThe tensor \u03c6i \u03c6j is of course reducible to the axial Killing\nvector \u03c6i , related to the family of diffeomorphisms xi\u01eb =\nxi + \u01eb \u03c6i . These represent azimuthal rotations and give rise\nto conservation of angular momentum (7).\n(ii) The metric g ij is a Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor and is\nNoether-related to the family of transformations\nxi\u01eb = xi + \u01eb g ij \u1e8bj = xi + \u01eb \u1e8bi\nor, equivalently,\nxi\u01eb (t) = xi (t) + \u01eb \u1e8bi (t) = xi (t + \u01eb)\nThe metric tensor g ij is therefore Noether\u2013related to invariance with respect to time translations t \u2192 t + \u01eb and gives\nrise to consevation of energy (or the Hamiltonian) given by\nEq. (2).\n(iii) The irreducible Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor Aij given by\neq. (28) is Noether-related to the family of transformations\nxi\u01eb = xi + \u01eb Aij \u1e8bj\nor, equivalently,\nx\u01eb = x + \u01eb [(x \u00d7 \u1e8b) \u00d7 x \u2212 (a \u00d7 \u1e8b) \u00d7 a]\n= x + \u01eb [(x \u2212 a) \u00d7 \u1e8b] \u00d7 (x + a)\n\nThis a-posteriori knowledge of the symmetry transformation allows a fast \"derivation\" of the quadratic invariant via\nthe Noether procedure: varying the action of the two-center\nproblem with respect to the above family of transformations\nyields no change, while the Lagrangian changes by \u2212\u01eb dA/dt\nwith A given by eq. (38). Then, Eq. (41) leads immediately\nto the quadratic invariant (36).\nAs mentioned above, these transformations are a symmetry of the action, giving rise to the constant of motion (35),\nbut are not diffeomorphisms since they depend on position\nand velocity. Nevertheless, writing \u01eb \u1e8bj (t) = xj (t + \u01eb) \u2212 xj (t)\nthey can be expressed as transformations in position and\ntime:\nxi\u01eb (t) = xi (t) \u2212 Aij xj (t) + Aij xj (t + \u01eb)\nwhere Aij is a function of xi (t).\nThe Noether theorem and its inverse, expressed by Eqs. (39)(42), also hold for a relativistic Lagrangian and can be used\nto show that the four constants of geodesic motion in a Kerr\n(or Kerr-de Sitter) spacetime are also Noether-related to\nsymmetries of the action. Axisymmetry is related to conservation of angular momentum about the symmetry axis\nas in case (i) above. Case (ii) discussed above has two analogues in general relativity: Stationarity (invariance of the\n\n3\n3.1\n\nINVARIANTS QUARTIC IN THE\nMOMENTA\nKilling equation and integrability conditions\n\nIn the limit a \u2192 0, the rank-2 Killing tensor (28) of the\n2-centre potential reduces to a combination Rxi Rxj + Ryi Ryj +\nRzi Rzj of the axial Killing vectors Rxi , Ryi , Rzi of the spherically symmetric 1-centre potential. Intuitively, one might\nthen expect a hierarchy, whereby a 4-centre potential (with\nsource centres at \u00b1a, \u00b1b) admits a rank-4 Killing tensor (reducible to a combination of rank-2 tensors in the 2-centre\nlimit a \u2192 b), an 8-centre potential admits a rank-8 Killing\ntensor, and so forth. In light of this, we consider the next\nnatural generalization of the previous section, that is, invariants quartic in the momenta\nI(x, p) = K ijkl (x)pi pj pk pl + K ij (x)pi pj + K(x)\n\n(43)\n\nijkl\n\nassociated with a rank-four Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor K\n. The\nabove quantity is conserved iff it commutes with the Hamiltonian, in the sense of a vanishing Poisson bracket, Eq. (9).\nEvaluating the bracket with I given by Eq. (43) and H given\nby Eq. (2) yields\n{I, H} = \u2202 m K ijkl pi pj pk pl pm\n\n+ (\u2202 k K ij \u2212 4K ijkl \u2202l \u03a6)pi pj pk\n\n+ (\u2202 k K \u2212 2K ik \u2202i \u03a6)pk\n\n(44)\n\nDemanding strong integrability, that is, requiring that this\nPoisson bracket vanish for all orbits, we have\n\u2202 (m K ijkl) = 0\n(k\n\n\u2202 K\n\nij)\n\nk\n\n= 4K\n\n(45)\nijkl\n\n\u2202l \u03a6\n\nik\n\n\u2202 K = 2K \u2202i \u03a6\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\nAs in the previous section, a solution to Eq.

The above set of equations is employed in Hietarinta (1987) to find quartic invariants for various two-dimensional systems.\nEq. (46) may be regarded as an inhomogeneous Killing\nequation and is also subject to an integrability condition.\nThe general solution to this equation and its integrability\ncondition are obtained in Appendix A. We find that a solution to Eq. (46) in E2 exists only if the following integrability\ncondition is satisfied:\n\u2202zzz (K yyyi \u2202i \u03a6) \u2212 3\u2202zzy (K yyzi \u2202i \u03a6) =\n\n\u2202yyy (K zzzi \u2202i \u03a6) \u2212 3\u2202yyz (K yzzi \u2202i \u03a6)\n\n(49)\n\n\f8\n\nC. Markakis\n\nwhere i is summed over the y and z components and \u2202ij...k\nis an abbreviation for \u2202i \u2202j ...\u2202k . Extending this integrability\ncondition to En is straightforward and, as shown in Appendix A, given by\n\u2202nml fijk \u2212 \u2202nmi fljk \u2212 \u2202njl fimk + \u2202nji flmk\n\n\u2212\u2202kml fijn + \u2202kmi fljn + \u2202kjl fimn \u2212 \u2202kji flmn = 0\n\n(50)\n\nwhere f ijk = 4K ijkl \u2202l \u03a6. Eq. (49) follows from (50) by setting n = m = i = z and i = j = k = y. Eq. (49) will\nsuffice for our present purposes, as we shall restrict attention to two-dimensional motion in section 3.3 and beyond.\nIf, in addition to H and Lz , a third constant of motion exists\nfor all initial conditions in three dimensions, then this constant ought to also be conserved in the special case of orbits\nwith Lz = 0 that lie on a meridional plane. That is, three\ndimensional motion is integrable only if meridional motion\nis integrable. We may thus set x = 0 and study motion restricted on the meridional (y-z) plane first. If such motion\nis found to be integrable, generalization to three dimensions\nis straightforward by virtue of axisymmetry.\nEqs. (45)\u2013(49) suggest a systematic method for obtaining potentials admitting quartic invariants:\n(i) The tensor K ijkl may be computed by solving Eq. (45)\nsubject to the symmetries of the problem.\n(ii) With this tensor known, the integrability condition\n(49) provides a restriction on the Newtonian potential \u03a6.\nSolving this condition yields a family of possibly integrable\npotentials.\n(iii) Given a family of potentials \u03a6 which satisfy the condition (49), one may obtain the tensor K ij by solving the\ninhomogenous Killing equation (46).\n(iv) With K ijkl and K ij known, Eq. (49) provides a further restriction on the potential \u03a6.\n(v) If a family of potentials \u03a6 are found that satisfy\nthe above integrability conditions, then one may obtain the\nscalar function K by integrating the components of Eq. (47).\nWe now proceed to carry out the above steps in more\ndetail.\n\n3.2\n\nRank-four Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensors\n\nIn E3 , Eq. (45) constitutes an overdetermined system of 21\nequations for the 15 unknown independent components of\nthe symmetric tensor K ijkl . Similarly, in E2 , Eq. (45) is a\nsystem of 6 equations for 5 unknowns. The system may be\nsolved by noticing that each component of K ijkl must be\na fourth order polynomial in the Cartesian coordinates xi .\nHorwood (2008) considered the equation \u2202 (j K i1 ***iN ) = 0\nfor a tensor K i1 ***iN of arbitrary valence N and showed that\nthe general solution is given by\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nX\nN\ni ***i i\n***i\nCL1 L L+1 N Xi1 \u2297 * * *\nK=\nL\nL=0\n\n* * * \u2297 XiL \u2297 RiL+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 RiN\n\n(51)\n\ni1 ***iN\nwhere the objects CL\n, labelled by L = 0, ..., N , are\ni ***i j\n***j\nconstant and subject to the symmetries CL1 L L+1 N =\n(i1 ***iL )(jL+1 ***jN )\nCL\n. The above expression, for N = 4 and\n\nwith Xi , Rj given by Eq. (3), provides the general solution to Eq. (45). Imposing known isometries on the quartic\ni1 ***iN\ninvariant (43) constrains the coefficients CL\nStationarity has already been imposed (as the system\nis autonomous). For three dimensional motion, axisymmetry\nmay be imposed via the requirement that the above KillingSt\u00e4ckel tensor is Lie-derived by the axial vector \u03c6 = Rz ,\nthat is\n\u00a3\u03c6 K ijkl = \u03c6m \u2202m K ijkl \u2212 K mjkl \u2202m \u03c6i \u2212 K mikl \u2202m \u03c6j\n\u2212 K mijl \u2202m \u03c6k \u2212 K mijk \u2202m \u03c6l = 0\n\n(52)\n\n(For purely meridional motion, enforcing the above condition does not change the relevant coefficients of K ijkl projected to the meridional plane.) In addition, we also require Z2 reflection symmetry about the equatorial plane,\nthat is, the replacement {z, pz } \u2192 {\u2212z, \u2212pz } leaves the\nquantity K ijkl pi pj pk pl unchanged. Since the latter quantity is a fourth order polynomial in the (Cartesian) position\nand momentum variables, imposing the above isometries is\nstraightforward via algebraic manipulation software such as\nMathematica. Imposing the above symmetries significantly\nreduces the number of independent polynomial coefficients.\nThen, after dropping trivial terms such as g (ij g kl) , g (ij \u03c6k \u03c6l) ,\n\u03c6i \u03c6j \u03c6k \u03c6l which correspond to reducible Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensors, we find that the most general nontrivial solution to (45)\nsubject to the symmetry (R, +) \u00d7 SO(2) \u00d7 Z2 can be written\nin the remarkably simple form\nK ijkl = \u03baA(ij B kl) + \u03bcg (ij C kl)\nij\n\nij\n\n(53)\n\nij\n\nwhere A is given by Eq. (28) and B , C are given by\nthe same equation with the replacements a \u2192 b, a \u2192 c\nrespetively:\nB ij = g mn \u03b5ikm \u03b5j ln (xk + bk )(xl \u2212 bl )\n\n(54)\n\nC\n\n(55)\n\nij\n\n=\n\ng mn \u03b5ikm \u03b5j ln (xk\n\nk\n\nl\n\nl\n\n+ c )(x \u2212 c )\n\nwhere b = b \u1e91, c = c \u1e91 and a, b, c are arbitrary parameters.\nIt will be shown in Sec. 3.4 that \u03bc = 0, leaving the first term\nA(ij B kl) in Eq. (53) as the only possibility for an irreducible\nKilling tensor of rank-4. Note that the above expressions\nwere obtained in two dimensions. In three dimensions, additional reducible terms constructed from combinations of the\naxial Killing vector \u03c6i and other Killing tensors (\u03c6j or g kl )\nwill be present, which vanish for meridional motion. These\nreducible terms can be dropped, by virtue of energy and angular momentum conservation. The combination A(ij B kl) is\nthus the only nontrivial possibility in both two and three\ndimensions. This completes step (i) of our prescribed procedure.\n\n3.3\n\nFirst integrability condition: no-hair relation\n\nWith the tensor K ijkl known, the next step consists of finding the class of gravitational potentials \u03a6 that satisfy the\nintegrability condition (49). A stationary axisymmetric vacuum potential that vanishes at infinity is characterized by\nthe multipole expansion (29). Assuming equatorial plane\nreflection symmetry, the odd moments ML (L = 1, 3, ...)\nvanish. Restricting attention to purely meridional motion,\nwith K ijkl and \u03a6 given by eqs. (53) and (29), we find with\nstraightforward algebra that the integrability condition (49)\n\n\fConstants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields\nis satisfied if and only if the even multipole moments satisfy\nthe two-step recursion relation\n\u0010\nh\n\u03bc \u0011\n\u03bci\nML+2 \u2212 \u03baa2 b2 \u2212 c2 ML\n\u03baML+4 = \u03ba(a2 + b2 ) \u2212\n8\n8\n(56)\nIf \u03ba = 0 and \u03bc 6= 0, the above relation reduces to the\n\"no-hair\" relation (30) and Eq. (53) gives a reducible rank4 Killing tensor, constructed from the rank-2 Killing tensor\n(29) and the metric g ij .\nIf \u03ba 6= 0 and \u03bc = 0, the above relation simplifies to\nML+4 = (a2 + b2 )ML+2 \u2212 a2 b2 ML\n\n(57)\n\nwhich generalizes the \"no-hair\" relation (30). One may obtain all higher moments recursively from the first two nonvanishing moments. This yields\nML =\n\n(a2 bL \u2212 aL b2 )M0 + (aL \u2212 bL )M2\na 2 \u2212 b2\n\n(58)\n\nfor L even (and ML = 0 for L odd). In the limit b \u2192 0,\none recovers the no-hair relations (30) and (31) (except for\nL = 0). The limit b \u2192 a is slightly more subtle. Although\nthe b \u2192 a limit of eq. (57) is satisfied by (30) the converse\nis not necessarily true, because Eq. (57) does not fix the\nrelation between the first two moments. Applying Eq. (57)\nrecursively after taking the limit b \u2192 a (or taking the same\nlimit of Eq. (58) and applying the l' H\u00f4spital rule) yields\n\u0014\n\u0015\nL\nlim ML = aL M0 + (a\u22122 M2 \u2212 M0 )\n(59)\nb\u2192a\n2\nIf the mass and quadrupole moment are related by M2 =\na2 M0 then one recovers Eq. (31), but this need not be the\ncase and M2 is generally considered independent of M0 . If\na 6= b, then the gravitational field depends on four independent parameters (M0 , M2 , a, b) and the reparametrization\nma = (M2 \u2212 b2 M0 )/(a2 \u2212 b2 ), mb = (M2 \u2212 a2 M0 )/(b2 \u2212 a2 )\nallows us to write Eq. (58) in the suggestive form\nML = aL ma + bL mb\n\n(60)\n\nThen, summing the Legendre series (29) yields the potential\nma /2\nma /2\n\u2212p\nx2 + y 2 + (z \u2212 a)2\nx2 + y 2 + (z + a)2\nmb /2\nmb /2\n\u2212p\n(61)\n\u2212p\nx2 + y 2 + (z \u2212 b)2\nx2 + y 2 + (z + b)2\n\n\u03a6=\u2212 p\n\ncreated by four fixed point sources with mass ma /2 at positions \u00b1a \u1e91 and mass mb /2 at positions \u00b1b \u1e91.\nIf \u03ba 6= 0 and \u03bc 6= 0, one may introduce new parameters\n\u03b1, \u03b2 such that \u03ba(a2 +b2 )\u2212 \u03bc8 = \u03ba(\u03b12 +\u03b2 2 ) and \u03baa2 b2 \u2212 \u03bc8 c2 =\n\u03ba\u03b12 \u03b2 2 . Eq. (56) then takes the form\nML+4 = (\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 )ML+2 \u2212 \u03b12 \u03b2 2 ML\n\n(62)\n\nwhich is analogous to Eq. (57). One can then proceed as in\nthe previous case and obtain the multipole moments\nML = \u03b1L m\u03b1 + \u03b2 L m\u03b2\n\n(63)\n\nof a potential analogous to (61), with a, b replaced by \u03b1, \u03b2.\nOur solution procedure guarantees that Eq. (60) (or its\nanalogue for nonzero \u03bc, Eq. (63)) gives the unique vacuum\npotential with the symmetry (R, +) \u00d7 SO(2) \u00d7 Z2 compatible\nwith the integrability condition (49). This completes step (ii)\nof the prescribed procedure.\n\n3.4\n\n9\n\nSecond integrability condition: nonexistence\nof quartic invariants\n\nWith \u03a6 obtained from Eq. (61) (\u03ba 6= 0 and \u03bc = 0) or (63)\n(\u03ba 6= 0 and \u03bc 6= 0), one may use eqs. (A6)-(A9) to solve the\ninhomogeneous Killing equation (46).\nIn the case \u03ba 6= 0, \u03bc = 0, we find\nK ij =2BAij + 2AB ij\n\n+(b2 \u2212 a2 )(\u00c3 \u2212 B\u0303)(z\u03b4yi \u03b4yj \u2212 y\u03b4y(i \u03b4zj) ) + \u03bd Dij\n\n(64)\n\nwhere \u03bd is a constant, A is given by Eq. (35) with the replacement M0 \u2192 2ma , \u00c3 is given by\nma (z + a)\nma (z \u2212 a)\n\u00c3 = q\n+q\n2\ny 2 + (z + a)\ny 2 + (z \u2212 a)2\n\n(65)\n\nand B, B\u0303 are given by Eqs. (35), (65) with the replacements\na \u2192 b and ma \u2192 mb . The additive contribution C ij to\nEq. (64) is a solution to the homogenous Killing equation\n(11), which is polynomial of second order in the cartesian\ncoordinates. Since the homogeneous solution must obey the\nsymmetries of the problem, it must have the form of Eq.\n(28), with a replaced by some other parameter c, that is\nDij = g mn \u03b5ikm \u03b5j ln (xk + dk )(xl \u2212 dl )\n\n(66)\n\nwhere d = d \u1e91.\nIn the case \u03ba 6= 0, \u03bc 6= 0, one may proceed in a similar\nway. However, upon substitution of the resulting expressions\ninto (A8), (A9), we find that the two relations yield different\nresults, unless \u03bc = 0. Thus, since K ij must be symmetric,\nwe are left with \u03ba 6= 0, \u03bc = 0, and Eq. (57), as the only\nviable possibility. This completes step (iii) of our prescribed\nprocedure.\nThe next step is to solve the second integrability condition (48) for a potential with moments given by Eq. (57).\nHowever, substituting Eqs. (61) and (64) into the condition\n(48), we find that the latter cannot be satisfied except in the\nlimit b \u2192 a, whence the quartic invariant is reducible to the\nquadratic invariant of the previous section.\nWe infer that there exists no stationary, axisymmetric,\nequatorially symmetric vacuum Newtonian potential that admits an independent nontrivial invariant quartic in the momenta. That is, the only quartic invariants are trivial products of lower-order invariants.\nThe proof of this nonexistence result used the fact that\nstrong integrability requires existence of a constant of motion for all values of energy E and angular momentum Lz ,\nincluding the case of purely meridional orbits with Lz = 0.\nFailure to satisfy Eq. (49) means that there exists no independent constant for purely meridional motion; therefore\nthere exists no strong integral for three-dimensional motion.\nOne could alternatively use the integrability condition (50)\nto derive the same nonexistence result directly in E3 .\nAs mentioned earlier, this section was motivated by\nthe intuitive expectation that 4-centre potentials may admit\nrank-4 Killing tensors, reducible to a combination of rank-2\ntensors in the appropriate limit. Remarkably, this expectation was partially fulfilled, in the sense that the most general\nrank-4 tensor consistent with stationarity, axisymmetry and\nequatorial symmetry, given by Eq. (53), is precisely such a\ncombination and that its integrability conditions (49) lead\nuniquely to 4-centre potentials, given by Eq. (61). Nevertheless, since the remaining integrability conditions (48) are not\n\n\f10\n\nC. Markakis\n\nsatisfied, this tensor does not give rise to a quartic invariant.\nSimple considerations based on Poisson brackets show that\nintegrability is a non-linear property, in the sense that a linear superposition of integrable Newtonian potentials need\nnot be also integrable. In view of this, the integrability of\n2-centre potentials (and their relativistic analogues) is exceptional, but the non-integrability of 4-centre potentials is\nnot surprising.\nThe nonexistence of a quartic invariant does not nevertheless preclude the possibility that the potential (61) admits some other constant of motion with different dependence in the momenta. A superficial study of Poincar\u00e9 maps\nof three dimensional orbits in the potential (61) may show\nthat most orbits appear to be regular. This could lead to\nthe (false) impression that the system is integrable. However, a thorough scan of initial conditions reveals the existence of Birkhoff chains and in some cases ergodic motion surrounds the main island of stability on the Poincar\u00e9\nmaps, confirming the non-integrability of 4-centre potentials. In a relativistic context, a similar behaviour has been\nobserved for orbits in certain stationary axisymmetric spacetimes (Apostolatos et al. 2009; Lukes-Gerakopoulos et al.\n2010; Contopoulos et al. 2011).\n\n4\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe aim of this work was to use a direct approach in order to\nstudy polynomial constants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields in a Newtonian context and to\ngain insight into analogous problems in relativistic gravity.\nThe results established via this direct search include:\n(i) the uniqueness of the constant (35)-(36) of the Euler\nproblem: Eq. (32) gives the only stationary, axisymmetric,\nequatorially symmetric Newtonian vacuum potential admitting a Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor of rank two;\n(ii) the uniqueness of the constant (36)-(38) of the Lagrange problem: Eq. (37) gives the only stationary, axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric Newtonian potential admitting a Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor of rank two;\n(iii) the relation of the quadratic constant in the Lagrange\nproblem to that of Lynden-Bell (2003), and the analogy with\nthe Carter constant in a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime;\n(iv) the integrability conditions (49), (50) which do not\nappear to have been implemented previously in direct\nsearches for quartic invariants (c.f. Hietarinta 1987).\n(v) the non-existence of stationary, axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric, vacuum Newtonian potentials admitting\na Killing-St\u00e4ckel tensor of rank four.\nNote that the assumptions of vacuum and equatorial symmetry may be relaxed without loss of integrability in the\ntwo-center problem (Lynden-Bell 2003). Note also that the\nintegrability condition (49) and its generalization to arbitrary dimension, Eq. (50), can be quite useful for other direct searches of quartic invariants in physical systems.\nElectromagnetic or gravitational-wave observations of\norbital motion around a massive black hole at the galactic centre can probe its gravitational field and test the\nvalidity of the Kerr solution and the no-hair theorem.\nTo this end, several authors have explored the possibility of spacetime mapping by modelling the central ob-\n\nject as a bumpy black hole (cf. the review by Johannsen\n2012 and references therein). To this end, Gair et al.\n(2008) and Brink (2008a, 2010a,b) suggested the possibility of using integrable stationary axisymmetric spacetimes of the Manko-Novikov type. However, a conjecture on existence of a quartic constant of motion (Brink\n2011) was later disproven by (Kruglikov & Matveev 2011)\nand (Lukes-Gerakopoulos 2012) for the case of the ZipoyVoorhees metric. Mirshekari & Will (2010) provide a nonexistence proof for the Bach-Weyl spacetime. Although nonexistence results have been obtained for particular stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, no such result has been established for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes with arbitrary\nmultipole moments.\nThe present work provides a non-existence proof of\nquartic invariants for generic stationary axisymmetric vacuum gravitational fields in the Newtonian regime. Extending\nthe present analysis to the relativistic regime is a nontrivial\ntask. However, the methods employed here provide useful\nintuition for treating the analogous problem in relativistic\ngravity or post-Newtonian approximations to it. In particular, if a stationary axisymmetric system is nonintegrable\nin the Newtonian limit, it is unlikely to be integrable in\nthe relativistic regime (although the converse is not true).\nThis is consistent with Kruglikov & Matveev (2011) and\nLukes-Gerakopoulos (2012) and provides evidence in favour\nof the conjecture that a stationary, axisymmetric, equatorially symmetric, vacuum (modulo a cosmological constant)\nspacetime is integrable if and only if it belongs to the Kerr\n(or Kerr-de Sitter) class. Therefore, attempts to seek stationary axisymmetric and equatorially symmetric vacuum\nsolutions in general relativity (other than Kerr) that admit\nirreducible polynomial invariants are unlikely to yield positive results.\nThis can lead to further insights on how to parametrize\nthe departure of a spacetime geometry from that of a Kerr\nspacetime and the relation of this departure to integrabilty\nor ergodocity. In particular, if the nonexistence conjecture\nis true, at least two conclusions can be drawn. First, ergodic\ngeodesics exist if and only if the spacetime geometry deviates\nfrom Kerr. This is in agreement with numerical evidence in\nApostolatos et al. (2009); Lukes-Gerakopoulos et al. (2010);\nLukes et al. (2010); Contopoulos et al. (2011), although a\ngeneral proof is still lacking. Second, approaches towards\nmodelling bumpy black holes as integrable, such as those\nattempted by Gair et al. (2008); Brink (2008a, 2010a,b) are\nless likely to be successful than approaches that do not require integrability, such as those based on canonical perturbation theory (Vigeland 2010; Vigeland & Hughes 2010).\nAs mentioned earlier, the uniqueness and non-existence\nproofs for Newtonian gravity are strongly suggestive of similar behaviour in General Relativity. A rotating black hole's\nmass moments are identical to those of two Newtonian centers fixed at imaginary distance from each other. Thus, the\nEuler (and Lagrange) problems can qualitatively capture\nmany features (such as integrability of motion, cosmological\nconstant, resonant frequencies, separability of wave equations and other non-gravitomagnetic phenomena) of their\nrelativistic counter-parts. Newtonian systems can therefore\nserve as simple toy-models whose study as surrogates of Kerr\nand non-Kerr spacetimes offers valuable insights and opens\ninteresting questions. For example, in Newtonian gravity,\n\n\fConstants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields\nthe quadratic constant is known to extend beyond equatorial plane symmetry (Aksenov, Grebenikov, & Demin 1963;\nLukyanov et al. 2005; Lynden-Bell 2003). Since the Kerr\nfamily is equatorially symmetric, this raises the question of\nwhether other stationary axisymmetric solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations exist that still admit a quadratic\nconstant of motion but are not equatorially symmetric.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author thanks T.

(A6)-(A9) provide the solution to the inhomogeneous\nKilling equation (A1).\nBecause Kij is a symmetric tensor, the above two ex4\npressions must be equal. Acting with \u2202yyzz = \u2202y\u22022 \u2202z 2 on Eqs.\n(A8), (A9), demanding that the two expressions be equal\nand using Eqs. (A6), (A7), yields the integrability condition\n\u2202zzz fyyy \u2212 3\u2202zzy fyyz = \u2202yyy fzzz \u2212 3\u2202yyz fyzz\n\n(A10)\n\nwhich must necessarily be satisfied by fijk in order for\nEq. (A1) to have a solution. Note that the unknown functions Z, Y, \u03b6, \u03c8 do not appear in the above condition. In\nthe homogeneous case, these functions can be easily shown\nto be quadratic polynomials in their arguments by setting\nfijk = 0, demanding that expressions (A8) and (A9) be\nequal and separating variables.\nThe integrability condition (A10) may be generalized to\nEn as follows. Eq. (A1) can be expanded out as\n\u2202i Kjk + \u2202j Kik + \u2202k Kij = 3fijk\n\n(A11)\n\nThe first term vanishes if we apply \u2202l and antisymmetrize\nover l and i. The second term vanishes if we subsequently\napply \u2202m and antisymmetrize over m and j. Finally, the\nthird term vanishes if we apply \u2202n and antisymmetrize over\nn and k. This yields the integrability condition\n\u2202nml fijk \u2212 \u2202nmi fljk \u2212 \u2202njl fimk + \u2202nji flmk\n\n\u2212\u2202kml fijn + \u2202kmi fljn + \u2202kjl fimn \u2212 \u2202kji flmn = 0\n\n(A12)\n\nwhich generalizes Eq. (A10) to arbitrary dimension.\nAPPENDIX A: INTEGRABILITY CONDITIONS\nAND INHOMOGENEOUS KILLING\nEQUATIONS\nWe consider the inhomogeneous Killing equation\n\u2202(k Kij) = fijk\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere f ijk = 4K ijkl \u2202l \u03a6. In E2 , the cartesian components of\nthe above equation read\n\u2202y Kyy = fyyy\n\n(A2)\n\n\u2202z Kyy + 2\u2202y Kyz = 3fyyz\n\n(A3)\n\n\u2202y Kzz + 2\u2202z Kzy = 3fyzz\n\n(A4)\n\n\u2202z Kzz = fzzz\n\n(A5)\n\nThe above system is overdetermined and may be solved as\nfollows: Integrating Eq. (A2) with respect to y and Eq. (A5)\nwith respect to z yields\nZ\nKyy = Z(z) + dyfyyy\n(A6)\nZ\nKzz = Y (y) + dzfzzz\n(A7)\nwhere Z(z) and Y (y) are scalar functions of their arguments.\nThen, integrating Eq. (A3) with respect to y and Eq. (A4)\n\nAPPENDIX B: KILLING-ST\u00c4CKEL TENSORS\nOF RANK-FOUR WITH REFLECTION\nSYMMETRY IN TWO DIMENSIONS\nAs explained in Sec. 3.2, we are interested in solving Eq.\n(45) in E2 . The most general solution, according to Eq. (51)\ncan be written as\nK = Aijkl Xi \u2297Xj \u2297Xk \u2297Xl + Bijkl Xi \u2297Xj \u2297Xk \u2297Rl\n+ C ijkl Xi \u2297Xj \u2297Rk \u2297Rl + Dijkl Xi \u2297Rj \u2297Rk \u2297Rl\n+ E ijkl Ri \u2297Rj \u2297Rk \u2297Rl\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere the generators of translations and rotations are given\nby Eq. (3) and the constant coefficients possess the symmetries Aijkl = A(ijkl) , Bijkl = B(ijk)l , C ijkl = C (ij)(kl) ,\nDijkl = Di(jkl) and E ijkl = E (ijkl) . Here, we consider a\nmeridional (yz) slice of the respective three-dimensional system. Indices are thus summed over values such that only\ney , ez and their linear combination Rx = y ez \u2212 z ey appear\nin K; all other components vanish in the meridional plane.\nThe number of independent coefficients is reduced upon imposing symmetries.\nFirst, we impose Z2 reflection symmetry about the\nequatorial (xy) plane by requiring that K be invariant under the replacement {z, ez } \u2192 {\u2212z, \u2212ez }. (This amounts\n\n\fConstants of motion in stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields\nto invariance of K ijkl pi pj pk pl under {z, pz } \u2192 {\u2212z, \u2212pz }.)\nThis yields the constraints\nAyyyz = Ayzzz = 0\n\n(B2a)\n\nByyzx = Bzzzx = 0\n\n(B2b)\n\nDzxxx = 0\n\n(B2d)\n\nC yzxx = 0\n\n(B2c)\n\nSecond, recall that the respective three-dimensional system\nis axisymmetric about the z-axis. Considering a meridional\n(yz) slice of this system and making a rotation of 2\u03c0 radians\nabout the z-axis amounts to a reflection about the xz plane.\nThus, the respective two-dimensional system inherits a Z2\nreflection symmetry about the xz plane. Imposing invariance\nwith respect to the replacement {y, ey } \u2192 {\u2212y, \u2212ey } yields\nthe constraints\nAyyyz = Ayzzz = 0\nB\n\nyyyx\n\n=B\n\nyzzx\n\n=0\n\nC yzxx = 0\n\nD\n\nyxxx\n\n=0\n\n(B3a)\n(B3b)\n(B3c)\n(B3d)\n\nImposing both sets of constraints (B2),(B3) to the tensor\n(B1) yields the solution\nK = Ayyzz (Xy \u2297Xy \u2297Xz \u2297Xz + Xy \u2297Xz \u2297Xy \u2297Xz\n+ Xy \u2297Xz \u2297Xz \u2297Xy + Xz \u2297Xy \u2297Xz \u2297Xy\n\n+ Xz \u2297Xy \u2297Xy \u2297Xz + Xz \u2297Xz \u2297Xy \u2297Xy )\n\n+ Ayyyy Xy \u2297Xy \u2297Xy \u2297Xy + Azzzz Xz \u2297Xz \u2297Xz \u2297Xz\n+ C yyxx Xy \u2297Xy \u2297Rx \u2297Rx + C zzxx Xz \u2297Xz \u2297Rx \u2297Rx\n\n+ E xxxx Rx \u2297Rx \u2297Rx \u2297Rx\n\n(B4)\n\nThe above expression gives the most general rank-4 KillingSt\u00e4ckel tensor in E2 consistent with the symmetry (R, +) \u00d7\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 . For clarity, let us set define new parameters\n\u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc, a, b, c such that E xxxx = \u03ba, Azzzz = \u03bb, C zzxx = \u03bc,\nAyyzz = (2\u03bb \u2212 \u03bcc2 )/6, Ayyyy = \u03bb \u2212 \u03bcc2 + \u03baa2 b2 , C yyxx =\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba(a2 + b2 ). This reparametrization involves no loss of\ngenerality, since a, b, c are allowed to be real or imaginary.\nThen, the solution (B4) takes the simple form\nK ijkl = \u03baA(ij B kl) + \u03bbg (ij g kl) + \u03bcg (ij C kl)\nij\n\nij\n\n(B5)\n\nij\n\nwhere the tensors A , B , C are given by Eqs. (28) and\n(55). When contracted with the momenta, the term g (ij g kl)\nin the above expression is the quartic part of the squared\nenergy, which is conserved; this term is thus dropped from\nEq. (53).\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/ LATEX file prepared\nby the author.\n\n13\n\n\f"}
