We are interested in a new kind of bi-dimensional bilinear\nparaproducts (appearing in [6]), which do not fit into the setting of\nbilinear Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators. In this paper we propose a fiberwise Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition, which is specially adapted to\nthis kind of bi-dimensional paraproduct.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet us first recall what is a standard paraproduct.\nA bilinear paraproduct \u03a0 on Rd is a bilinear operator of the following form :\nZ \u221e\ndt\n\u03c8t (f )(x)\u03c6t (g)(x) ,\n\u03a0(f, g)(x) :=\nt\n0\nwhere \u03c8 is a smooth function with a spectrum included in a corona around\n0, \u03c6 a smooth function, and for a function \u03b6, we write the L1 -normalized\nfunctions\n1\n\u03b6t (x) := d \u03b6(t\u22121 x).\nt\nTo a function \u03b6t , we associate the convolution operator \u03b6t (f ) := \u03b6t \u2217 f . So\nby this way, \u03c8t (f ) allows us to truncate f in the frequency space around the\nscale t\u22121 .\nThe paraproducts were the first studied singular bilinear operators. Their\nstudy began by the works of Bony in [1] and of Coifman and Meyer in [3, 4, 5],\nwhere in particular first continuities in Lebesgue spaces are shown. Indeed,\nsuch paraproducts fit into the setting of bilinear Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund theory\n(see the work of Grafakos and Torres [9] and Kenig and Stein [11]) and so\nother boundedness can be obtained. Finally, we have boundedness in the full\nand maximal range of exponents:\nDate: November 12, 2010.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 42B15.\nKey words and phrases. Bilinear operators, bilinear multipliers, paraproducts.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC BERNICOT\n\nTheorem 1. For all exponents 1 < p, q \u2264 \u221e satisfying\n1\n1 1\n0 < := + < 2,\nr\np q\nthere exists a constant C, such that\n\u2200f, g \u2208 S(Rd ),\n\nk\u03a0(f, g)kLr (Rd ) \u2264 Ckf kLp (Rd ) kgkLq (Rd ) .\n\nWhen p, q, r \u2208 (1, \u221e) the boundedness is an easy consequence of the\nLittlewood-Paley theory, and if one of the exponents p, q is infinite then the\nproof of the boundedness requires the notion of Carleson measure. Then,\nCalder\u00f3n-Zygmund theory allows us to get the boundedness for r \u2264 1.\nFor the last years, Lacey and Thiele have solved the famous Calder\u00f3n's conjecture concerning boundedness of bilinear Hilbert transform [12, 13]. This new\nkind of bilinear operators (far more singular than the previous one) have then\ngiven rise to numerous works. One of the main problems, concerning these\noperators, which are still open is the generalization of these boundedness for\nthe two-dimensional bilinear Hilbert transforms.\nDemeter and Thiele have begun to describe a partial result in [6] but boundedness for the following operator is still open : let f, g \u2208 S(R2 )\nZ\ndz\nH(f, g)(x, y) := p.v. f (x \u2212 z, y)g(x, y + z) .\nz\nR\nThere are no results for this model operator. The main difficulty is that\nthe singular operation p.v.(1/z) is simultaneously acting on the two different\nvariables x and y. The time-frequency decomposition makes also appear a\nnew phenomenon, mixing the two coordinates.\nIn order to understand first this new problem, we aim to study the following\noperator :\nZ \u221e\ndt\nT (f, g)(x, y) :=\n\u03c8t,x [f ](x, y)\u03c8t,y [g](x, y) ,\nt\n0\nwhere \u03c8t,x and \u03c6t,y are usual convolutions in the x (or y) variable. This\noperator is to H what the classical paraproduct is to the one dimensional\nbilinear Hilbert transform. So to study H, we have first to understand this\nnew bilinear operator T , involving the problem of mixing the two coordinates.\nThis operator is the prototype of the singular operators corresponding to the\nsixth and remaining open case in [6]. Note that T can be viewed as a limiting\n(degenerate) case of some of the other cases (cases 1, 4, 5) in [6].\nWe emphasize that here, we do not prove any boundedness for such operators.\nIt seems that standard arguments (Littlewood-Paley and Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund\ntheories) cannot be employed to prove one boundedness of this new kind of\nparaproducts and a new approach should be required. However, we propose\nhere an extension result (similar to what is known for classical paraproducts):\nstarting from one supposed boundedness, we then deduce other continuities\n\n\fFIBER-WISE CALDER\u00d3N-ZYGMUND DECOMPOSITION\n\n3\n\nby making lower the Lebesgue exponents. More precisely, we will prove the\nfollowing result:\nTheorem 2. Assume that T is bounded from Lp0 (R2 )\u00d7Lq0 (R2 ) to Lr0 ,\u221e (R2 )\nfor some exponents p0 , q0 \u2208 (1, \u221e) satisfying\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+ .\nr0\np0\nq0\nThen for all exponents p, q, r satisfying p \u2208 [1, p0 ], q \u2208 [1, q0 ] and\n1\n1 1\n1\n< = + \u2264 2,\nr0\nr\np q\n\u2022 T admits a bounded extension from Lp (R2 ) \u00d7 Lq (R2 ) to Lr (R2 ) if\np, q > 1;\n\u2022 T admits a bounded extension from Lp (R2 ) \u00d7 Lq (R2 ) to Lr,\u221e (R2 ) if\np = 1 or/and q = 1.\nWe postpone the proof to the next section. Moreover, we will give some\ncomments concerning the dual operators of T too.\nThe proof relies on a fiber-wise Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition. We move\nthe reader to [14] for a multiple frequencies Calder\u00f3n-Zgymund decomposition,\nwell-adapted to multi-frequency inequalities. The fiber-wise decomposition,\npresented here, can be seen as the analogue for the bi-dimensional analysis.\nMoreover, we point out that Fefferman has already used a more complicated\nfiber-wise Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition in [7] to study the double Hilbert\ntransform.\n2. The extension of boundedness result\nThe section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2. By bilinear Marcinkiewicz\ninterpolation between weak type inequalities (see [10]), Theorem 2 is reduced\nto the following proposition :\nProposition 3. Let assume that T is bounded from Lp (R2 ) \u00d7 Lq (R2 ) to\nLr,\u221e (R2 ) for some exponents p \u2265 1, q \u2265 1 and\n1 1\n1\n= + .\nr\np q\nThen\n\u2022 if p > 1, T admits a bounded extension from L1 (R2 ) \u00d7 Lq (R2 ) to\nLs,\u221e (R2 ) with\n1\n1\n=1+ ;\ns\nq\n\n\f4\n\nFR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC BERNICOT\n\n\u2022 if q > 1, T admits a bounded extension from Lp (R2 ) \u00d7 L1 (R2 ) to\nLs,\u221e (R2 ) with\n1\n1\n= + 1.\ns\np\nProof. The paraproduct T is almost symmetric in f and g. The proof, presented below, does not distinguish between \u03c8 and \u03c6 and therefore by symmetry, we only prove the first claim for p > 1.\nSo assume that p > 1 and let us fix a function g, which can be assumed normalized without loss of generality : kgkLq (R2 ) = 1.\nLet us introduce a well-adapted dense subspace D of L1 (R2 ): D is the set of\nfunctions f \u2208 L1 (R2 ) such that there exist a finite sequence (fj1 )j of L1 (R)\nand a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint measurable sets (Ej )j of R verifying\nX\n(1)\nf (x, y) =\nfj1 (x)1Ej (y).\nj\n\nIn fact, D corresponds to the tensor product L1 (R) \u2297 L1 (R).\nWe aim to prove that there exists a constant c such that for all \u03b1 > 0 and\nevery function f \u2208 D\n\b\n(2)\n(x, y) \u2208 R2 , |T (f, g)(x, y)| > \u03b1 \u2264 c\u03b1\u2212s kf ksL1 (R2 ) .\n\nUsing that set D is dense into L1 (R2 ) and into L1 (R2 )\u2229Lp (R2 ), we deduce that\nT admits an extension which is bounded from L1 (R2 ) \u00d7 Lq (R2 ) to Ls,\u221e (R2 ).\nAiming to prove (2), we fix \u03b1 > 0 and a function f \u2208 D. For every fixed\ny \u2208 R, by definition of D, f (*, y) is a L1 (R)-function and so we can choose a\nCalder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition at the scale \u03b3 := \u03b1s kf k1\u2212s\nL1 (R2 ) (see [2]). So\nthere exist functions by and atoms (ai,y )i supported on cubes Qi,y such that\nP\n\u2022 f (*, y) = by + i ai,y ;\n\u2022 for all y, we have kby kL1 (R) \u2264 kf (*, y)kL1 (R) and kby kL\u221e (R) . \u03b3;\n\u2022 for all i, the atom ai,y has a vanishing mean value on Qi,y and\nkai,y kL1 (Qi,y ) . \u03b3|Qi,y |;\nP\n\u2022 for all y, i |Qi,y | . \u03b3 \u22121 kf (*, y)kL1(R) .\nP\nThen, let us define b(x, y) := by (x) and a(x, y) := i ai,y (x). It is easy to see\nthat b is in fact measurable in R2 . Indeed using decomposition (1) of f , we\ncan write\nX\nb1j (x)1Ej (y)\nb(x, y) =\nj\n\nb1j\n\nfj1\n\nwhere is the \"good part\" of\ncoming from its Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition.\nSo b is measurable and we have kbkL\u221e (R2 ) . \u03b3 and kbkL1 (R2 ) \u2264 kf kL1 (R2 ) .\nThus by interpolation,\n(3)\n\n\u2032\n\n1/p\n\nkbkLp(R2 ) . \u03b3 1/p kf kL1 (R2 ) .\n\n\fFIBER-WISE CALDER\u00d3N-ZYGMUND DECOMPOSITION\n\n5\n\nBy splitting, T (f, g) = T (b, g) + T (a, g), it suffices to study the two terms.\nThe first one can be bounded using the previous inequality (3) and the assumed boundedness of T as follows :\n\b\n\n(x, y) \u2208 R2 , |T (b, g)(x, y)| > \u03b1\n\u2264 \u03b1\u2212r kT (b, g)krLr,\u221e(R2 ) . \u03b1\u2212r kbkrLp(R2 )\n\u2032\n\nr/p\n\nr/p+(1\u2212s)r/p\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n. \u03b1\u2212r \u03b3 r/p kf kL1(R2 ) . \u03b1\u2212r+sr/p kf kL1 (R2 )\n. \u03b1\u2212s kf ksL1 (R2 ) ,\nwhere we used that\n1\n1 1\n\u2212 = \u2032\ns r\np\n\nand so\n\nsr\n= r \u2212 s.\np\u2032\n\nSo this term is acceptable according to (2).\nThen, as usual we expect to have pointwise bounds of T (ai,y , g) outside the\nball 2Qi,y . So we have first to remove this set. This is possible since\n|{(x, y), x \u2208 \u222ai 2Qi,y }| .\n\nZ\n\n.\u03b3\n\n|\u222ai 2Qi,y | dy . \u03b3 \u22121\n\nR\n\u22121\n\u2212s\n\n.\u03b1\n\nkf kL1 (R2 ) .\n\nZ\n\nkf (*, y)kL1 (R) dy\n\nR\ns\u22121+1\n\u2212s\n\u03b1 kf kL\n1 (R2 )\n\nkf ksL1 (R2 ) .\n\nIt remains us to study the following term:\nI :=\n\nn\n(x, y), x \u2208 (\u222ai 2Qi,y )c ,\n\no\n|T (a, g)(x, y)| > \u03b1 .\n\nFirst, we use the specific structure of T to deduce\nT (a, g)(x, y) =\n(4)\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u03c8t,x [a](x, y)\u03c6t,y [g](x, y)\n\nZ0 \u221e X\n0\n\ni\n\ndt\nt\n\n\u03c8t [ai,y ](x)\u03c6t,y [g](x, y)\n\ndt\n.\nt\n\nThen fix y \u2208 R and take x \u2208 (\u222ai 2Qi,y )c , we have to bound the right hand side\nof (4).

The previous proof is based on a fiber-wise Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund\ndecomposition for f \u2208 L1 (R2 ). We have worked for functions belonging to a\ndense subspace, in order to get around technical problems of measurability.\n\n\fFIBER-WISE CALDER\u00d3N-ZYGMUND DECOMPOSITION\n\n7\n\nIndeed for f \u2208 L1 (R2 ), we know that for almost every y \u2208 R, we can consider the function f (*, y) \u2208 L1 (R). Applying the standard Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund\ndecomposition, we obtain f (*, y) = by + ay . Then we define a global \"good\npart\" of the function f , by defining b(x, y) := by (x) for almost every y \u2208 R.\nBut to compute estimates on b, it is important to first check that b is measurable in R2 . In general, this seems to be not obvious, it is related to problems involving measurable selections (in the stopping time argument of the\nCalder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition).\nThat is why, here we have prefered to work with specific functions f which can\nbe split into tensor products and then the measurability is easily obtained.\nHaving concluded the proof of our main result Theorem 2, we are now interested in the dual operators of T . Let us compute the two dual operators T \u22171\nand T \u22172 (with respect to f or g), it comes :\nZ \u221e\ndt\nT \u22171 (h, g)(x, y) =\n\u03c8t,x [h\u03c6t,y (g)](x, y)\nt\n0\nand\n\nT \u22172 (f, h)(x, y) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c6t,y [\u03c8t,x (f )h](x, y)\n\ndt\n.\nt\n\nAs we have remarked during the previous proof for (4), we have used a specific\nproperty of the operator T . More precisely, we have employed the fact that\nto compute T (f, g)(x, y) requires only information on f (*, y) and not on the\nwhole function f (and similarly for g), in order that for all (x, y) \u2208 R2\nT (f, g)(x, y) := T (f (*, y), g(x, *))(x, y).\nThis fact is very important in the proof and allowed us to use the standard\nCalder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition. It is interesting to emphasize that this\nproperty is not satisfied for the two dual operators T \u22171 and T \u22172 . Indeed to\ncompute T \u22171 (h, g)(x, y), we require information on the whole function g (since\nwe have the first operator \u03c6t,y in the y variable and then the second one \u03c8t,x\nin the x variable) and on the function h (we have just an operator \u03c8t,x on the\nx variable but a vanishing mean value of h in one of the two variables does\nnot bring an extra decay in order to repeat the previous arguments). So we\ncannot reproduce the previous reasoning for the dual operators and we do not\nknow if such an extension result is true for them.\nThe operator T is the prototype operator of those described by the last and\nsixth case in [6]. Moreover, we note that the operators appearing in the\ncases 1,4 and 5 of [6] do not satisfy this specific structure of T (like the\ndual operators T \u22171 and T \u22172 ) too and so cannot be studied by this fiber-wise\nCalder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition.\n\n\f8\n\nFR\u00c9D\u00c9RIC BERNICOT\n\nReferences\n[1] J.M.
