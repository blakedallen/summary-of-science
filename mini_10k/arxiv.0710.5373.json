INTRODUCTION\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: crispino@ufpa.br\naddress: ah28@york.ac.uk\n\u2021 Electronic address: matsas@ift.unesp.br\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nIt has been thirty years since the discovery of the Unruh effect (Unruh, 1976) which can be also found under\nthe name of Davies-Unruh, Fulling-Davies-Unruh, and\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1 Part of Feynman's blackboard at California Institute\nof Technology at the time of his death in 1988. At the righthand side one can find \"accel. temp.\" as one of the issues \"to\nlearn\".\n\nUnruh-Davies-DeWitt-Fulling effect. This is a conceptually subtle quantum field theory result, which has played\na crucial role in our understanding that the particle content of a field theory is observer dependent in a sense\nto be made precise later (Fulling, 1973) [see also Unruh\n(1977)]. This effect is important in its own right and as a\ntool to investigate other phenomena such as the thermal\nemission of particles from black holes (Hawking, 1974,\n1975) and cosmological horizons (Gibbons and Hawking,\n1977). It is interesting that the Unruh effect was on\nFeynman's list of things to learn in his later years (see\nFig. 1). In short, the Unruh effect expresses the fact that\nuniformly accelerated observers in Minkowski spacetime,\ni.e. linearly accelerated observers with constant proper\nacceleration (also called Rindler observers), associate a\nthermal bath of Rindler particles (also called FullingRindler particles) to the no-particle state of inertial observers (also called Minkowski vacuum). Rindler particles are associated with positive-energy modes as defined\nby Rindler observers in contrast to Minkowski particles,\nwhich are associated with positive-energy modes as defined by inertial observers. Unruh (1976) also provides\nan explanation for the conclusion obtained by Davies\n(1975) that an observer undergoing uniform acceleration\na = const in Minkowski spacetime would see a fixed inertial mirror to emit thermal radiation with temperature\na~/(2\u03c0kc), and the reason why this is not in contradiction with energy conservation. Although there are some\naccounts in the literature discussing the Unruh effect,1\nwe believe that this review will be a useful contribution\nfor the reasons we list below.\nFirstly, some authors have recently questioned the existence of the Unruh effect (Narozhny et al., 2002, 2004).\nWe believe there are two main sources of confusion, which\nneed to be clarified in order to address these objections.\nOne is that it has not been made clear that the heuristic\n\nexpression of the Minkowski vacuum as a superposition\nof Rindler states makes sense outside as well as inside the\ntwo Rindler wedges. Although this point is not central\nto the Unruh effect (Fulling and Unruh, 2004), it will be\nuseful to point out that this heuristic expression in fact\nmakes sense in the whole of Minkowski spacetime. Another common source of confusion is that the Unruh effect\nis sometimes tacitly assumed to be the equivalence of the\nexcitation rate of a detector when it is (i) uniformly accelerated in the Minkowski vacuum and (ii) static in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles (rather than of Rindler\nparticles). There is no such equivalence in general, although this showed up by coincidence in some early examples in the literature (see discussion in Sec. III.A.4).\nWe emphasize that this point does not contradict the fact\nthat the detailed balance relation satisfied by static detectors in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles is in general\nalso valid for uniformly accelerated ones in the Minkowski\nvacuum (Unruh, 1976). The identification of the Unruh\neffect with the behavior of accelerated detectors seems\nto have generated sometimes unnecessary confusion. It\nis worthwhile to emphasize that the Unruh effect is a\nquantum field theory result, which does not depend on\nthe introduction of the detector concept. In this sense, it\nis better to see the detailed balance relation satisfied by\nuniformly accelerated detectors as a natural consequence\nor application rather than a definition of the Unruh effect. In order to exemplify the meaning of the Unruh\neffect as the equivalence between the Minkowski vacuum\nand a thermal bath of Rindler particles, we collect and\ndiscuss a number of illustrative physical applications.\nThe Unruh effect has also been connected with the\nlong-standing discussion about whether or not sources2\nuniformly accelerated from the null past infinity to the\nnull future infinity radiate with respect to inertial observers. Although some aspects of this issue are surely\nworthwhile to be investigated and the corresponding discussion can be enriched by considering the Unruh effect,\nit is useful to keep in mind that the Unruh effect does not\ndepend on a consensus on this issue which seems to be\nmostly semantic [see Fulling (2005) for a brief discussion\non it and related references]. We comment briefly on this\nissue in Sec. III.A.5.\nSecondly, there have been several recent proposals to\ndetect the Unruh effect in the laboratory and it is useful to review and assess them. We shall emphasize that,\nalthough it is certainly fine to interpret laboratory observables from the point of view of uniformly accelerated\nobservers, the Unruh effect itself does not need experimental confirmation any more than free quantum field\ntheory does.3\n\n2\n1\n\nSee, e.g., Birrell and Davies (1982); Fulling and Ruijsenaars\n(1987); Ginzburg and Frolov (1987); Sciama et al. (1981); Takagi\n(1986); Wald (1994).\n\n3\n\nThroughout this review we will use the word \"sources\" to mean\nscalar sources, particle detectors or electric charges depending\non the context where it appears.\nThis statement should be understood in the sense that we are\ndealing with mathematical constructions that stand on their\n\n\f3\nCitation Number\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06\n\nFIG. 2 Histogram depicting the number of citations of Unruh\n(1976) over the years.\n\nFinally, there has been an increasing interest in the\nUnruh effect (see Fig. 2) because of its connection with a\nnumber of contemporary research topics.4 The thermodynamics of black holes and the corresponding information puzzle is one of them. It will be beneficial, therefore,\nto review the literature on the generalized second law,5\nquantum information,6 and related topics with the Unruh effect as the central theme.\nThe review is organized as follows. In Section II we\nreview the derivation of the Unruh effect, emphasizing\nthe fact that the quantum field expanded by the Rindler\nmodes can be used in the whole of Minkowski spacetime, partly to respond to the recent criticisms mentioned above. We also touch upon more rigorous approaches such as the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem in\nalgebraic field theory and general theorems on field theories in spacetimes with bifurcate Killing horizons. A\nbrief discussion of the Unruh effect in interacting field\ntheories is also included. In Section III we present in\ndetail some typical examples which illustrate the physical content of the Unruh effect. We start by reviewing the behavior of accelerated detectors which can be\nalso used to describe the physics of accelerated atomic\nsystems. Then, we analyze the weak decay of accelerated protons and the bremsstrahlung from accelerated\ncharged particles. Section IV is dedicated to the discussion of some experimental proposals for laboratory signatures of the Unruh effect in particle accelerators, in microwave cavities, in the presence of ultra-intense lasers,\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\nown. The assertions follow from the definitions and so do not\nneed to be experimentally verified. The fact that \"Rindler and\nMinkowski perspectives\" give consistent physical predictions is a\nconsequence of the validity of these constructions.\nThe data in Fig. 2 should not be used to infer any relative or\nabsolute measure of the importance of the Unruh effect. It has\nbeen introduced only as an illustration on the increasing interest\nin this issue.\nSee, e.g., Unruh and Wald (1982, 1983); Wald (2001).\nSee, e.g., Bousso (2002); Peres and Terno (2004).\n\nin the vicinity of accelerated boundaries, and in hadronic\nprocesses. In Section V we comment on some recent developments concerning the Unruh effect, which include\nthe possible reduction in fidelity of teleportation when\none party is accelerated, the decoherence of accelerated\nsystems and the possible observer-dependence of the entropy concept. We conclude the review with a summary\nin Section VI. Throughout this review we use natural\nunits ~ = c = G = k = 1 and signature (+ \u2212 \u2212\u2212) unless\nstated otherwise.\nIt would be impossible to give a completely balanced\naccount of so much work in the literature concerning the\nUnruh effect. This review heavily reflects our own experience with the Unruh effect, and we fear that we may have\noverlooked some important related papers. However, we\nhope at least to have included a sufficient number of papers to allow the readers to trace back to most of the\nimportant related results.\nII. THE UNRUH EFFECT\nA. Free scalar field in curved spacetime\n\nEven though the Unruh effect is about quantum field\ntheory (QFT) in flat spacetime, it is useful to review\nbriefly the general framework of non-interacting QFT in\ncurved spacetime. We treat only the simplest theory,\ni.e. the theory of a Hermitian scalar field satisfying the\nKlein-Gordon equation. We present it in a schematic\nand heuristic way as is done in Birrell and Davies (1982).\nA mathematically more satisfactory treatment can be\nfound, e.g., in Wald (1994).\nLet us first remind the reader of some important features of QFT in Minkowski spacetime. In this spacetime the scalar field is expanded in terms of the energymomentum eigenfunctions, and the vacuum state is defined as the state annihilated by all annihilation operators, i.e. the coefficient operators of the positive-frequency\neigenfunctions defined to be those proportional to e\u2212ik0 t\nwith k0 > 0, where t is the time parameter. The coefficient operators of the negative-frequency modes proportional to eik0 t are the creation operators, and the states\nobtained by applying creation operators on the vacuum\nstate are identified with states containing particles. Notice that the time-translation symmetry, which enables\none to define positive- and negative-frequency solutions\nto the Klein-Gordon equation, plays a crucial role in the\ndefinition of the vacuum state and the Fock space of particles. Therefore, in a general curved spacetime with no\nisometries, there is no reason to expect the existence of\na preferred vacuum state or a useful concept of particles.\nFor simplicity we specialize to (D + 1)-dimensional\nspacetimes whose metric takes the form\nds2 = [N (x)]2 dt2 \u2212 Gab (x)dxa dxb ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere x = (t, x). The coefficient N (x) is called the lapse\nfunction (Arnowitt et al., 1962) and Gab is the metric on\n\n\f4\nthe spacelike hypersurface of constant t. (All spacetimes\nwe consider in this review have a metric of this form.)\nIn this spacetime the minimally-coupled7 massive KleinGordon equation (\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc + m2 )\u03c6 = 0, which arises as the\nEuler-Lagrange equation from the Lagrangian density,\nL=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212g (\u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 )/2,\n\n(2.2)\n\ntakes the form\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2202t (N \u22121 G\u2202t \u03c6) \u2212 \u2202a (N GGab \u2202b \u03c6) + N Gm2 \u03c6 = 0,\n(2.3)\nwhere the space indices a and b run from 1 to D.\nGiven two complex solutions fA (x) and fB (x) to the\nKlein-Gordon equation, we define the Klein-Gordon current\n\u03bc\nJ(f\n(x)\nA ,fB )\n\n\u2261 fA\u2217 (x)\u2207\u03bc fB (x) \u2212 fB (x)\u2207\u03bc fA\u2217 (x).\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u03bc\nThen, one can readily show that \u2207\u03bc J(f\n(x) = 0.\nA ,fB )\nHence, the quantity\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03bc\n(fA , fB )KG \u2261 i dD x Gn\u03bc J(f\n(2.5)\nA ,fB )\n\nis independent of t, where n\u03bc is the future-directed unit\nvector normal to the hypersurface \u03a3 of constant t. (The\nintegral here and throughout this subsection (Sec. II.A)\nis over the hypersurface \u03a3.) We call this quantity the\nKlein-Gordon inner product of fA and fB . For the metric\n(2.1) it takes the following form:\nZ\n\u221a\n(fA , fB )KG = i dD x GN \u22121 (fA\u2217 \u2202t fB \u2212fB \u2202t fA\u2217 ). (2.6)\nThe conjugate momentum density \u03c0(x) is defined as \u03c0 \u2261\n\u2202L/\u2202 \u03c6\u0307, where \u03c6\u0307 \u2261 \u2202t \u03c6. For the metric (2.1) one finds\n\u221a\n\u03c0(x) = N \u22121 G\u03c6\u0307(x).\n\n(2.7)\n\nNote that, if we let pA (x) and pB (x) be the conjugate\nmomentum density for the solutions fA (x) and fB (x),\nrespectively, then the Klein-Gordon inner product can\nbe expressed as\nZ\n(fA , fB )KG = i dD x[fA\u2217 (x)pB (x) \u2212 p\u2217A (x)fB (x)]. (2.8)\n\nhyperbolic with t = const hypersurfaces as the spacelike\nCauchy surfaces.8\nThe quantization of the field \u03c6 proceeds as follows. We\ndenote the field operators corresponding to \u03c6 and \u03c0 by\n\u03c6\u0302 and \u03c0\u0302, respectively. One imposes the following equaltime canonical commutation relations:\nh\ni\n\u03c6\u0302(t, x), \u03c6\u0302(t, x\u2032 ) = [\u03c0\u0302(t, x), \u03c0\u0302(t, x\u2032 )] = 0, (2.9)\nh\ni\n\u03c6\u0302(t, x), \u03c0\u0302(t, x\u2032 ) = i\u03b4 D (x, x\u2032 ),\n(2.10)\n\nwhere the delta-function \u03b4 D (x, x\u2032 ) is defined by\nZ\ndD xf (x)\u03b4 D (x, x\u2032 ) = f (x\u2032 ).\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u221a\nNote here that there is no density factor G on the lefthand side. For arbitrary complex-valued solutions fA (x)\nand fB (x) to the Klein-Gordon equation (2.3) (with a\nsuitable integrability conditions) one finds\n[(fA , \u03c6\u0302)KG , (\u03c6\u0302, fB )KG ] = (fA , fB )KG ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nfrom the equal-time canonical commutation relations\n(2.9) and (2.10) by using Eq. (2.7).\nNow, assume that there is a complete set of solutions,\n{fi , fi\u2217 }, to the Klein-Gordon equation (2.3) satisfying\n(fi , fj )KG = \u2212(fi\u2217 , fj\u2217 )KG = \u03b4ij ,\n(fi\u2217 , fj )KG = (fi , fj\u2217 )KG = 0.\n\n(2.13)\n(2.14)\n\nWe assume here that the indices labeling the solutions are\ndiscrete for simplicity of the discussion but its extension\nto the cases with continuous labels is straightforward. In\nMinkowski spacetime one chooses the positive-frequency\nmodes as fi 's and, consequently, the negative-frequency\nmodes as fi\u2217 's. In a general globally-hyperbolic curved\nspacetime without isometries, there are infinitely many\nways of choosing the functions fi 's.\nExpanding the quantum field \u03c6\u0302(x) as\ni\nXh\n\u00e2i fi (x) + \u00e2\u2020i fi\u2217 (x) ,\n(2.15)\n\u03c6(x) =\ni\n\none finds\n\u00e2i = (fi , \u03c6)KG , \u00e2\u2020i = (\u03c6, fi )KG .\n\n(2.16)\n\nWe assume that the Klein-Gordon equation determines\nthe classical field \u03c6(x) uniquely given a (well-behaved)\ninitial data (\u03c6, \u03c0) on a hypersurface of constant t. This\nproperty is known to hold if the spacetime is globally\n\nOne can readily show, by using Eqs. (2.12), (2.13) and\n(2.14), that\n\n7\n\n8\n\nIt is customary to allow the field to couple to the scalar curvature. Thus, the general Klein-Gordon equation takes the form\n(\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc + \u03beR + m2 )\u03c6 = 0. The minimally-coupled scalar field\nhas \u03be = 0 by definition.\n\n[\u00e2i , \u00e2j ] = [\u00e2\u2020i , \u00e2\u2020j ] = 0, [\u00e2i , \u00e2\u2020j ] = \u03b4ij .\n\n(2.17)\n\nA Cauchy surface is a closed hypersurface which is intersected by\neach inextendible timelike curve once and only once. A spacetime\nis said to be globally hyperbolic if it possesses a Cauchy surface.\nSee, e.g., Wald (1984).\n\n\f5\nConversely, if these commutation relations are satisfied,\nthen the equal-time canonical commutation relations\n(2.9) and (2.10) follow. To prove this, one first shows\nthat any two complex-valued solutions fA (x) and fB (x)\nto the Klein-Gordon equation (2.3) satisfy Eq. (2.12) by\nexpanding them in terms of fi (x) and fi\u2217 (x) and using\nthe commutators (2.17). Then, for example, by letting\nfA (t, x) = fB\u2217 (t, x) and pA (t, x) = \u2212p\u2217B (t, x), at a given\ntime t and evaluating the Klein-Gordon inner products\nin Eq. (2.12) at time t, one obtains\nZ\n\nh\ni\ndD x dD x\u2032 fB (t, x)pB (t, x\u2032 ) \u03c6\u0302(t, x), \u03c0\u0302(t, x\u2032 )\nZ\n= i dD xfB (t, x)pB (t, x).\n(2.18)\nSince fB (t, x) and pB (t, x) are arbitrary, one can conclude that Eq. (2.10) holds at time t. Eq. (2.9) can be\nderived in a similar manner.\n\u00e2\u2020i\n\nThe operators \u00e2i and\nare called the annihilation\nand creation operators, respectively. The vacuum state\n|0i is defined by requiring \u00e2i |0i = 0. The Fock space of\nstates is obtained by applying the creation operators \u00e2\u2020i\non the vacuum state |0i. We call the operator N\u0302i = \u00e2\u2020i \u00e2i\n(with no summation on the right-hand side) the number\noperator in the mode 'i'. However, note that, since it\nis not always easy to construct a (theoretical) detector\nmodel which is excited when the eigenvalue of N\u0302i changes\nfrom 1 to 0, say, the operator N\u0302i does not necessarily lead\nto a useful particle concept.\nSince the coefficient operators \u00e2i of the functions fi\nannihilate the vacuum state |0i, the choice of the functions fi satisfying Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14) determines the\nvacuum state. For this reason we call the functions fi the\npositive-frequency modes and their complex conjugates fi\u2217\nthe negative-frequency modes in analogy with the case in\nMinkowski spacetime. Thus, the choice of the positivefrequency modes determines the vacuum state. In a general curved spacetime there is no privileged choice of the\npositive-frequency modes, and consequently, there is no\nprivileged vacuum state unlike in Minkowski spacetime,\nas we mentioned before.\nNow, suppose that two complete sets of positive(2)\n(1)\nfrequency modes {fi } and {fI } satisfy the KleinGordon inner-product relations (2.13) and (2.14), where\nthe lower-case letters i, j are replaced by the upper-case\n(2)\nequivalents I, J for fI . Since both sets are complete,\n(2)\nthe modes fI can be expressed as linear combinations\n(1)\u2217\n(1)\nand vice versa.

The Bogolubov transformation found its first major application to QFT in curved spacetime in the derivation of particle creation in expanding universes (Parker,\n1968; Sexl and Urbantke, 1969).\nThe vacuum states |0(1) i and |0(2) i corresponding to\n(1)\nthe two sets of positive-frequency modes {fi } and\n(2)\n{fI }, respectively, are distinct if \u03b2Ii do not vanish for\nall I and i. For example, the expectation value of the\n(1)\u2020 (1)\n(1)\nnumber operator N\u0302i = \u00e2i \u00e2i for the state |0(1) i is\nzero by definition but for the state |0(2) i it can be calculated by using Eq.

Rindler wedges\n\nAs we have seen in the previous subsection, one has a\nnatural static vacuum state in a static globally hyperbolic\nspacetime. Minkowski spacetime with the metric\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nt\n\nV\nEDK\n\nLR\n\nRR\n\nz\n\n(2.30)\n\nThen, it is natural to let the positive-frequency solutions\nfi have a t-dependence of the form e\u2212i\u03c9i t , where \u03c9i are\npositive constants interpreted as the energy of the particle with respect to the (future-directed) Killing vector10\n\u2202/\u2202t. If the spacetime is globally hyperbolic and static,\nthen this choice of positive-frequency modes leads to a\nwell-defined and natural vacuum state that preserves the\ntime-translation symmetry. We call this state the static\nvacuum.\nMinkowski spacetime has global timelike Killing vector\nfields, which generate time translations in various inertial frames. The sets of positive-frequency modes corresponding to these Killing vectors are the same and are\nthe usual positive-frequency modes proportional to e\u2212ik0 t\nwith k0 > 0, where t is the time parameter with respect\nto one of the inertial frames. Thus, all these Killing vector fields define the same vacuum state.11\nNow, in the region defined by |t| < z in Minkowski\nspacetime (here, z is one of the space coordinates), the\nboost Killing vector z(\u2202/\u2202t) + t(\u2202/\u2202z), i.e. the vector\nwith t- and z-components being z and t, respectively, is\ntimelike and future-directed. Hence, this region, called\nthe right Rindler wedge, is a static spacetime with this\nKilling vector playing the role of time translation. Thus,\none can define the corresponding static vacuum state. As\nwas observed by Fulling (1973), this vacuum state is not\nthe same as the state obtained by restricting the usual\nMinkowski vacuum to this region. This observation is\ncrucial in understanding the Unruh effect, as we shall\nexplain in the next subsections.\n\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 \u2212 dz 2\n\nU\n\n(2.31)\n\nIn fact, if a globally hyperbolic spacetime is stationary, i.e. if the\nmetric is t-independent with (\u2202/\u2202t)\u03bc being everywhere timelike\nbut with the cross term gti , i 6= t, not necessarily vanishing,\none has a natural vacuum state in this spacetime under certain\nconditions (Ashtekar and Magnon, 1975; Kay, 1978).\nA Killing vector K \u03bc is a vector satisfying \u2207\u03bc K\u03bd + \u2207\u03bd K\u03bc =\nK \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 g\u03bc\u03bd + g\u03b1\u03bd \u2202\u03bc K \u03b1 + g\u03bc\u03b1 \u2202\u03bd K \u03b1 = 0. In a coordinate system\nsuch that K \u03bc = (\u2202/\u2202\u03b8)\u03bc , one has \u2202g\u03bc\u03bd /\u2202\u03b8 = 0. See, e.g., Wald\n(1984).\nIt has been shown by Chmielowski (1994) that two commuting\nglobal timelike Killing vector fields define the same vacuum state.\n\nCDK\n\nFIG. 3 The regions with |t| < z, |t| < \u2212z, t > |z| and t <\n\u2212|z|, denoted RR, LR, EDK and CDK, respectively, are the\nleft Rindler wedge, right Rindler wedge, expanding degenerate\nKasner universe and contracting degenerate Kasner universe,\nrespectively. The curves with arrows are integral curves of\nthe boost Killing vector z(\u2202/\u2202t) + t(\u2202/\u2202z). The direction of\nincreasing U = t \u2212 z and that of increasing V = t + z are also\nindicated.\n\nis of course a static globally hyperbolic spacetime. As\nmentioned above, the part of this spacetime defined by\n|t| < z, called the right Rindler wedge, is also a static\nglobally hyperbolic spacetime. The region with the condition |t| < \u2212z is called the left Rindler wedge, and is also\na static globally hyperbolic spacetime. The region with\nt > |z|, also a globally hyperbolic spacetime though not\na static one, is called the expanding degenerate Kasner\nuniverse and the globally hyperbolic spacetime with the\ncondition t < \u2212|z| is called the contracting degenerate\nKasner universe. These regions are shown in Fig. 3.\nMinkowski spacetime is invariant under the boost\nt \u2192\n7\nt cosh \u03b2 + z sinh \u03b2,\nz \u2192\n7\nt sinh \u03b2 + z cosh \u03b2,\n\n(2.32)\n(2.33)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the boost parameter. These transformations\nare generated by the Killing vector z(\u2202/\u2202t) + t(\u2202/\u2202z).\nThe boost invariance of Minkowski spacetime motivates\nthe following coordinate transformation:\nt = \u03c1 sinh \u03b7,\n\nz = \u03c1 cosh \u03b7,\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and \u03b7 takes any real value. Then, the Killing\nvector is \u2202/\u2202\u03b7, and the metric takes the form\nds2 = \u03c12 d\u03b7 2 \u2212 d\u03c12 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 .\n\n(2.35)\n\nThis metric is independent of \u03b7 as expected. The world\nlines with fixed values of \u03c1, x, y are the trajectories of\nthe boost transformation given by Eqs. (2.32) and (2.33).\nEach world line has a constant proper acceleration given\nby \u03c1\u22121 = const.\nThe coordinates (\u03b7, \u03c1, x, y) cover only the regions with\nz 2 > t2 , i.e. the left and right Rindler wedges, as can\nreadily be seen from Eq. (2.34). To discuss QFT in the\n\n\f7\nright Rindler wedge, it is convenient to make a further\ncoordinate transformation \u03c1 = a\u22121 ea\u03be , \u03b7 = a\u03c4 , i.e.\nt = a\u22121 ea\u03be sinh a\u03c4, z = a\u22121 ea\u03be cosh a\u03c4,\n\nds = e\n\n2a\u03be\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(d\u03c4 \u2212 d\u03be ) \u2212 dx \u2212 dy .\n\nz = \u2212a\u22121 ea\u03be\u0304 cosh a\u03c4\u0304 .\n\n(2.37)\n\n(2.43)\n\n\u03a6\u0302+ (V ) =\n\nZ\n\n(2.44)\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nh\ni\ndk b\u0302+k fk (V ) + b\u0302\u2020+k fk\u2217 (V )\n\nwith\n\nC. Two dimensional example\n\nThe two dimensional massless scalar field in Minkowski\nspacetime is problematic because of infrared divergences (Coleman, 1973). Nevertheless, this theory is a\nvery good model for explaining the Unruh effect, and it\nis not necessary to deal with the infrared divergences for\nthis purpose. It also turns out that the Unruh effect in\nscalar field theory in higher dimensions can be derived in\nessentially the same manner as in this model.\nThe massless scalar field in two dimensions, \u03a6\u0302(t, z),\nsatisfies\n(2.39)\n\nThis field can be expanded as\nZ \u221e\ndk \u0010\n\u221a\n\u03a6\u0302(t, z) =\nb\u0302\u2212k e\u2212ik(t\u2212z) + b\u0302+k e\u2212ik(t+z)\n4\u03c0k\n0\n\u0011\n+b\u0302\u2020\u2212k eik(t\u2212z) + b\u0302\u2020+k eik(t+z) . (2.40)\nThe annihilation and creation operators satisfy\n[b\u0302\u00b1k , b\u0302\u2020\u00b1k\u2032 ] = \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 )\n\n\u03a6\u0302(t, z) = \u03a6\u0302\u2212 (U ) + \u03a6\u0302+ (V ),\nwhere\n\n(2.38)\n\nThe Killing vector z(\u2202/\u2202t) + t(\u2202/\u2202z) is timelike in\nthe two Rindler wedges and spacelike in the degenerate\nKasner universes. It becomes null on the hypersurfaces\nt = \u00b1z dividing Minkowski spacetime into the four regions. These hypersurfaces are examples of Killing horizons, which are defined as null hypersurfaces to which\nthe Killing field is normal (Wald, 1994).\nSince the right (or left) Rindler wedge is a static spacetime in its own right, it has a natural static vacuum state\nas we noted before. The Unruh effect is defined in this\nreview as the fact that the usual vacuum state for QFT\nin Minkowski spacetime restricted to the right Rindler\nwedge is a thermal state with \u03c4 playing the role of time,\nand similarly for the left Rindler wedge. The correlation\nbetween the right and left Rindler wedges in the usual\nMinkowski vacuum state plays an important role in the\nUnruh effect.\n\n(\u2202 2 /\u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202 2 /\u2202z 2 )\u03a6\u0302 = 0.\n\n(2.42)\n\nwe can write\n\nThis coordinate system will be useful because the world\nline with \u03be = 0 has a constant acceleration of a. The\n \u0304 for the left Rindler wedge are given by\ncoordinates (\u03c4\u0304 , \u03be)\nt = a\u22121 ea\u03be\u0304 sinh a\u03c4\u0304 ,\n\nU = t \u2212 z, V = t + z,\n\n(2.36)\n\nwhere a is a positive constant (Rindler, 1966). Then, the\nmetric takes the form\n2\n\nwith all other commutators vanishing. By using the definitions\n\n(2.41)\n\nfk (V ) = (4\u03c0k)\u22121/2 e\u2212ikV ,\n\n(2.45)\n\nand similarly for \u03a6\u0302\u2212 (U ). Since the left and right-moving\nsectors of the field, \u03a6\u0302+ (V ) and \u03a6\u0302\u2212 (U ), do not interact\nwith one another, we discuss only the left-moving sector\n\u03a6\u0302+ (V ). (Thus, we will discuss the Unruh effect for the\ntheory consisting only of the left-moving sector.) The\nMinkowski vacuum state |0M i is defined by b\u0302+k |0M i = 0\nfor all k.\nUsing the metric in the right Rindler wedge given by\nEq. (2.37), one finds a field equation of the same form as\nEq. (2.39):\n\u0001\n(2.46)\n\u2202 2 /\u2202\u03c4 2 \u2212 \u2202 2 /\u2202\u03be 2 \u03a6\u0302 = 0.\n(This is a result of the conformal invariance of the massless scalar field theory in two dimensions.) The solutions\nto this differential equation can be classified again into\nthe left- and right-moving modes which depend only on\nv = \u03c4 + \u03be and u = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03be, respectively.

This\nis the Unruh effect for the left-moving sector. It is clear\nthat the Unruh effect for the right-moving sector can be\nderived in a similar manner.\nD. Massive scalar field in Rindler wedges\n\nThe Unruh effect for scalar field theory in fourdimensional Minkowski spacetime can be derived in the\nsame way as for the two-dimensional example. Nevertheless, in view of the skepticism on the Unruh effect expressed recently by some authors (Belinskii et al.,\n1997; Fedotov et al., 1999; Narozhny et al., 2002, 2004;\nOriti, 2000) we review the Unruh effect in this theory (Fulling, 1973; Unruh, 1976), drawing attention to\nsome aspects that appear to have caused the skepticism.\n[See Fulling and Unruh (2004) for an explanation as to\nwhy this skepticism is unfounded.]\nThe free quantized massive scalar field \u03a6\u0302(t, z, x\u22a5 ),\nx\u22a5 \u2261 (x, y), can be expanded as\nZ\nM\u2020\n\u2217\n\u03a6\u0302(t, z, x\u22a5 ) = d3 k(\u00e2M\nkz k\u22a5 fkz k\u22a5 + \u00e2kz k\u22a5 fkz k\u22a5 ), (2.79)\nwhere the positive-frequency mode functions are\n\n13\n\nWe comment on how one can discuss thermal states in field theory without discretization in Sec.

This\nchoice corresponds to the static vacuum state with respect to the \u03c4 -translation, i.e. the Rindler vacuum state.\nIt is also clear that one may assume that they are proportional to eik\u22a5 *x\u22a5 .

The relation between (\u03c4, \u03be) and (t, z) given by\nEq. (2.36) is the same as that between (\u03c4\u0304 , \u03be\u0304) and (t, \u2212z)\nL\nR\ngiven by Eq. (2.38).

However, the formula (2.112) gives\nthe positive-frequency modes w\u00b1\u03c9k\u22a5 in terms of the momentum eigenfunctions unambiguously as a distribution\nover the whole of Minkowski spacetime. In other words,\nif f (t, x) is a compactly-supported smooth function on\nMinkowski spacetime, whose support may intersect the\nplane t = z = 0, the mode functions w\u00b1\u03c9k\u22a5 smeared\nwith f is well defined and unique.

Unruh effect and quantum field theory in the expanding\ndegenerate Kasner universe\n\nIn this subsection we review the relation between the\nmodes in the Rindler wedges and those in the expanding\ndegenerate Kasner universe. It is well known that there\nis a choice of the positive-frequency modes in the degenerate Kasner universes that gives a state identical to the\nMinkowski vacuum (Fulling et al., 1974). We first show\nthat these positive-frequency modes are in fact the modes\nw\u00b1\u03c9k\u22a5 in the Rindler wedges (Gerlach, 1988). Then, we\nshow that the Rindler vacuum state |0R i is identical to\none of the states in the expanding degenerate Kasner universe found in the literature (Birrell and Davies, 1982;\nFulling et al., 1974).\nWe introduce the following coordinate transformation:\nt = T cosh a\u03b6, z = T sinh a\u03b6.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nt+z\n= e2a\u03b6 ,\nt\u2212z\n\n2\n\nds = dT \u2212 a T d\u03b6 \u2212 dx \u2212 dy .\n\n(2.135)\n\n(2.136)\n\nand that (t2 \u2212 z 2 )1/2 = T .\nLet us change the integration variable in the expression\n(2.112) for modes w\u00b1\u03c9k\u22a5 from kz to the rapidity \u03b8 =\n\u03b8(kz ) [see Eq.

(2.113) we find that the positivefrequency modes with respect to the boost generator in\nthe right Rindler wedge corresponding to the Rindler vacuum state take the following form in the expanding degenerate Kasner universe:\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u03b6 eik\u22a5 *x\u22a5\np\n2\u03c0 8a(e\u03c0\u03c9/a \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/a )\ni\u2217 o\nh\nn\n(2)\n(2)\n.\n\u00d7 e\u03c0\u03c9/a Hi\u03c9/a (\u03baT ) + Hi\u03c9/a (\u03baT )\n\nR\nv\u03c9k\n= \u2212i\n\u22a5\n\n(2.141)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\nThen, recalling the fact that [H\u03bd (x)]\u2217 = H\u2212\u03bd (x) if \u03bd is\npurely imaginary and if x is real and using the formulas (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 1980)\n\n(2.134)\n\nWith T > 0 the coordinate system (T, \u03b6, x\u22a5 ) covers the\nregion with the condition t > |z|, i.e. the expanding degenerate Kasner universe. Then, the Minkowski metric\nbecomes\n2\n\nThe hyperplanes of constant T are spacelike, and the\nvariable T plays the role of time. Hence, the T = const\nspace expands in the \u03b6-direction linearly. We note that\n\n(2)\n\ne\u03bd\u03c0i H\u2212\u03bd (z) = H\u03bd(2) (z),\nH\u03bd(1) (z)\n\n+\n\nH\u03bd(2) (z)\n\n= 2J\u03bd (z)\n\n(2.142)\n(2.143)\n\nwith \u03bd = \u2212i\u03c9/a in Eq.

(2.144) with e\u2212i\u03c9\u03b6 re\u22a5\ni\u03c9\u03b6\nplaced by e\nin the expanding degenerate Kasner universe. These modes have been identified as the positivefrequency modes corresponding to a state which is inequivalent to the Minkowski vacuum (Birrell and Davies,\n1982; Fulling et al., 1974). Thus, the Rindler vacuum\nstate |0R i is in fact one of the states in the expanding\ndegenerate Kasner universes given in the literature.\n\nAlthough the Unruh effect, like the Hawking effect, is\na quantum effect, its derivation does not involve any loop\ncalculations. It is also the result of properties of classical solutions to the field equation. These observations\nnaturally lead to the following question: \"Are there any\naspects of the Unruh effect that can be described entirely\nin the framework of classical field theory?\" In this context, it is useful to note that, although the Unruh temperature T = ~a/(2\u03c0c) (at \u03be = 0) is proportional to ~,\nsince the energy of a particle can be written as E = ~\u03c9,\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency, the Boltzmann factor\nexp(\u2212E/T ) = exp(\u22122\u03c0\u03c9c/a) is independent of ~. This\nis consistent with the fact that the Bogolubov transformation encoding the Unruh effect is derived using only\nclassical solutions. It is indeed possible to define some\nquantities in classical field theory which exhibit what one\nmay call the classical Unruh effect (Higuchi and Matsas,\n1993) as we briefly describe here. 15\nWe consider the classical scalar field \u03c6 in Minkowski\nspacetime satisfying (\u0003 + m2 )\u03c6 = 0.

Then, since T \u03bc \u2202\u03bc = \u2202t , we find\nthe energy by using Eq. (2.148) as\nZ\nET = d3 k k0 |cT (k)|2 .\n(2.152)\nIt is natural to define the quantity NT by dividing the\nintegrand k0 |cT (k)|2 by k0 as\nZ\nNT = d3 k |cT (k)|2 ,\n(2.153)\nbecause the expected quantum-mechanical particle number is NT /~. We call NT the classical Minkowski particle\nnumber. It is clear that\n\n(2.146)\n\nis conserved because of the Killing equation and the equation \u2207\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0. Hence, the energy associated with the\nKilling vector X \u03bc defined by\nZ\n\u03bc\nEX = d\u03a3 n\u03bc J(X)\n,\n(2.147)\nwhere \u03a3 is a Cauchy hypersurface and n\u03bc is the futuredirected unit vector normal to \u03a3, is conserved.

Thus, we have\n\u22a5\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(R+) (x) + \u03c6(R\u2212) (x),\n\n(2.155)\n\nwhere the positive-frequency part with respect to the\nboost Killing vector R\u03bc is defined by\nZ\nZ \u221e\nR\n\u03c6(R+) (x) =\nd\u03c9 d2 k\u22a5 cR (\u03c9, k\u22a5 )v\u03c9k\n(2.156)\n\u22a5\n0\n\n15\n\nHowever, we find the claim by Barut and Dowling (1990) that\nthe Unruh effect can be explained without invoking a thermal\nbath rather misleading. If one were to describe physics in the\nRindler wedge with the boost generator as the Hamiltonian, then\nthe thermal bath with the temperature a/2\u03c0 would definitely be\na necessary ingredient.\n\nfor some function cR (\u03c9, k\u22a5 ), and the negative-frequency\npart is \u03c6(R\u2212) (x) = [\u03c6(R+) (x)]\u2217 . The Rindler energy is\nfound by letting X \u03bc = R\u03bc in Eq.

We refer the reader to\nHiguchi and Matsas (1993) for the interpretation of this\nformula in the context of the Unruh effect.\nI. Unruh effect for interacting theories and in other\nspacetimes\n\nIn this subsection we briefly mention some works which\nextend the Unruh effect to interacting field theory and\nother spacetimes.\nLet\nus\nfirst\ndiscuss\nthe\nwork\nof\nBisognano and Wichmann (1975, 1976), who derived the Unruh effect for (interacting) quantum\nfield theory satisfying Wightman axioms (Jost, 1965;\nStreater and Wightman, 1964; Wightman, 1956). The\nUnruh effect was not presented as the main result\nin their work, and it was only several years after its\npublication that its connection to the Unruh effect was\ndiscovered by Sewell, who also extended their derivation\nof the Unruh effect to a class of spacetimes including\nSchwarzschild and de Sitter spacetimes (Sewell, 1982).\n\nIn order to discuss the work of Bisognano and Wichmann, it is necessary to review a mathematically more\nsatisfactory way to define a thermal state in quantum field theory, which is called the KMS condition (Haag et al., 1967).\n[The initials KMS stand\nfor Kubo (1957) and Martin and Schwinger (1959).] We\nfirst explain (one version of) the KMS condition for a\nquantum system with a finite number of energy levels\nwith a Hamiltonian \u0124 and a complete set of eigenstates\n|ni with energy En . The expectation value of an operator\n\u00c2 in a thermal state with inverse temperature \u03b2 = 1/T\nis\nP \u2212\u03b2En\nhn|\u00c2|ni\ne\nTr(e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124 \u00c2)\nh\u00c2i\u03b2 = nP \u2212\u03b2Em\n=\n.\n(2.163)\nTr(e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124 )\nme\nLet H be the Hilbert space spanned by |ni. This thermal\nstate is realized as a pure state in the Hilbert space H\u2297H\nas\nP \u2212\u03b2En/2\ne\n|ni \u2297 |ni\n|\u03b2i = n pP\n,\n(2.164)\n\u2212\u03b2E\nm\nme\n\nif the operators \u00c2 on H are identified with \u00c2(e) = I\u02c6 \u2297 \u00c2,\nwhere I\u02c6 is the identity operator. That is,\nh\u03b2|\u00c2(e) |\u03b2i = h\u00c2i\u03b2 .\n\n(2.165)\n\nThe time-evolution operator is taken to be\nexp(\u2212i\u0124 (e) \u03c4 ) = exp(i\u0124\u03c4 ) \u2297 exp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c4 ).\n\n(2.166)\n\nNow, let us define an anti-unitary involution J\u02c6(e) by\nJ\u02c6(e) \u03b1|ni \u2297 |mi = \u03b1\u2217 |mi \u2297 |ni,\n\n(2.167)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is any c-number. Then, the operator J\u02c6(e) commutes with the time-evolution operator:\nJ\u02c6(e) exp(\u2212i\u0124 (e) \u03c4 ) = exp(\u2212i\u0124 (e) \u03c4 )J\u02c6(e) , \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 R.\n(2.168)\nOne can also show by an explicit calculation\nP that, for any\noperator \u00c2 given by a matrix as \u00c2|ni = m |miAmn ,\nexp(\u2212\u0124 (e) \u03b2/2)\u00c2(e) |\u03b2i = J\u02c6(e) \u00c2(e)\u2020 |\u03b2i.\n\n(2.169)\n\nIt can readily be seen that, in our model with a finite\nnumber of energy levels, Eq. (2.169) implies that the state\n|\u03b2i must be given by Eq. (2.164) up to an overall phase\nfactor.\nIn algebraic field theory a state16 that allows a Hilbert\nspace representation satisfying the conditions (2.168) and\n(2.169) is called a KMS state at inverse temperature \u03b2.\nThus, the Unruh effect in algebraic field theory is the\nstatement that the Minkowski vacuum restricted to the\n\n16\n\nIn algebraic field theory \"a state\" means, roughly speaking, \"a\ndensity matrix\" in general.\n\n\f17\nright Rindler wedge is a KMS state at inverse temperature \u03b2 = 2\u03c0/a if the time-evolution is identified with\na boost, which is the \u03c4 -translation in the Rindler coordinates (2.36). Remarkably, the doubling of the Hilbert\nspace and the involution J\u02c6(e) in the above construction,\nwhich might look somewhat artificial in the context of\nstatistical mechanics, naturally arise here. Thus, given\nthe QFT in the right Rindler wedge with a boost generator as the Hamiltonian we 'extend' it by including\nthe left Rindler wedge and operators acting there. The\nextended boost generator automatically takes the form\n(2.166) since the corresponding Killing vector field is\npast-directed in the left Rindler wedge.\nIn the two-dimensional model (with only the left\nmovers) the involution J\u02c6(e) is defined by requiring\nJ\u02c6(e) |0M i = |0M i,\n\u02c6(e) = \u00e2L ,\nJ\u02c6(e) \u00e2R\n+\u03c9 J\n+\u03c9\n\n(2.170)\n\n\u00e2L\u2020\n+\u03c9 .\n\n(2.172)\n\n(e)\nJ (e) \u00e2R\u2020\n+\u03c9 J\n\n=\n\nThen, they converted the relation (2.175) to the KMS\ncondition (2.169) with \u0124 (e) = K\u0302, \u03b2 = 2\u03c0/a and with\nJ\u02c6(e) being the P CT operator times the \u03c0-rotation about\nthe z-axis for operators \u00c2(e) acting in the left Rindler\nwedge by a result similar to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem (Reeh and Schlieder, 1961). 18 [See Kay (1985) for\na discussion of the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem in the\ncontext of free field theory.]\nLet us describe how Eq. (2.175) can be derived in the\nsimplest case with n = 1 and with free (four-dimensional)\nscalar field. Using K\u0302|0M i = 0 and \u00e2M\nkz k\u22a5 |0M i = 0, we\nhave for a real parameter \u03b1\nexp(i\u03b1K\u0302)\u03a6\u0302(t, z, x\u22a5 )|0M i\n\n= \u03a6\u0302(t(\u03b1), z(\u03b1), x\u22a5 )|0M i\nZ\nd3 k\np\n=\nei(k0 z\u2212kz t) sinh \u03b1a\u2212ik\u22a5 *x\u22a5\n(2\u03c0)3 2k0\n\n(2.171)\n\n\u02c6 The involution J\u02c6(e) is in\nNote that [J\u02c6(e) ]2 = I\u02c6 \u2297 I.\nfact the P CT transformation, i.e. the anti-unitary transformation \u03a6\u0302(t, z) 7\u2192 \u03a6\u0302(\u2212t, \u2212z) in this two-dimensional\nmodel. For the four-dimensional scalar field it is the \u03c0rotation about the z-axis times the P CT transformation\n[see Bisognano and Wichmann (1975)]. With these definitions one can readily verify that Eqs. (2.66) and (2.67)\nimply Eq. (2.169). The commutation relation (2.168) follows from the fact that the Lorentz boost commutes the\nP CT transformation.\nThe\nderivation\nof\nthe\nUnruh\neffect\nby Bisognano and Wichmann (1975) using the algebraic approach was for any interacting scalar field\nsatisfying the Wightman axioms.\nThey also generalized this result to quantum fields of arbitrary\nspins (Bisognano and Wichmann, 1976). They showed\nthat the Minkowski vacuum restricted to the right or\nleft Rindler wedge is a KMS state as explained above.\nFor the four-dimensional scalar field theory, for example,\nif exp(\u2212iK\u0302\u03b1) is the boost operator corresponding to\nt 7\u2192 t(\u03b1) \u2261 t cosh \u03b1a + z sinh \u03b1a,\nz 7\u2192 z(\u03b1) \u2261 t sinh \u03b1a + z cosh \u03b1a,\n\n(2.173)\n(2.174)\n\n\u00d7ei(k0 t\u2212kz z) cosh \u03b1a \u00e2M\u2020\nkz k\u22a5 |0M i,\n\n(2.176)\n\nwhere t(\u03b1) and z(\u03b1) are defined by Eqs. (2.173) and\n(2.174), respectively. It can be shown that the variable\n\u03b1 can be analytically continued from 0 to i\u03c0/a if z > |t|,\ni.e. if the point (t, z, x\u22a5 ) is in the right Rindler wedge.19\nThus,\nexp(\u2212K\u0302\u03c0/a)\u03a6\u0302(t, z, x\u22a5 )|0M i = \u03a6\u0302(\u2212t, \u2212z, x\u22a5 )|0M i,\n(2.177)\nif the point (t, z, x\u22a5 ) is in the right Rindler wedge. This is\nindeed Eq. (2.175) with n = 1 for a free field. Noting that\nthe point (\u2212t, \u2212z, x\u22a5) is in the left Rindler wedge and\nusing the expansion (2.96) of the field \u03a6\u0302 in terms of the\nRindler modes, one can readily deduce from Eq. (2.177)\nthe relations (2.100) and (2.101), which were crucial in\nshowing the Unruh effect.\nUnruh and Weiss (1984) derived the Unruh effect for\nthe scalar field theory with arbitrary potential term V (\u03a6\u0302)\nin the path integral approach. [They also discussed the\nUnruh effect for spinors. See also Gibbons and Perry\n(1976).] Here we present their argument, for the twodimensional scalar field for simplicity of notation, in a\nslightly modified manner. What needs to be shown is\n\nthen, for \u03b1 = i\u03c0/a, one has (t, z) 7\u2192 (\u2212t, \u2212z).

(2.175) makes sense, i.e. that states obtained by multiplying\nR\n|0M i by a finite number of operators of the form d4 xf (x)\u03a6\u0302(x),\nwhere f (x) has support in the right Rindler wedge, is in the\ndomain of the operator exp(\u2212\u03b2 K\u0302) for 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 \u03c0/a.\nThis theorem states, roughly speaking, that any state in the\nHilbert space of the scalar field theory can be approximated\nby\nR\napplying polynomials of operators of the form d4 x f (x)\u03a6\u0302(x)\non the vacuum state |0M i, where f (x) have support in a finite\nspacetime region.\nTo be precise, one needs to consider the inner product of the\nstate in Eq. (2.176) with a normalized one-particle state. Note\nthat the modulus of ei(k0 z\u2212kz z) sinh \u03b1a in this equation is always\nless than or equal to 1 if \u03b1 is between 0 and i\u03c0/a.

(2.180) as\nte = \u03c1 sin a\u03c4e , ze = \u03c1 cos a\u03c4e .\n\n(2.184)\n\nThese equations show that the Euclideanized right\nRindler wedge is the two-dimensional Euclidean space\nexpressed in polar coordinates if 0 \u2264 a\u03c4e \u2264 2\u03c0, i.e. if\n\u03b2 = 2\u03c0/a.

(2.186)\n[D\u03c6] exp(\u2212SE )\n\nIt is well known that the time-ordered two-point function\nin (two-dimensional) Minkowski spacetime, i.e. the lefthand side of Eq. (2.178), is obtained from the right-hand\nside of Eq. (2.186) by the analytic continuation te = it.\nSince both sides of Eq. (2.178) are obtained by the analytic continuation of the same function D2\u03c0/a (xe ; x\u2032e )\nwith xe = (te , ze ) = (it, z), Eq. (2.178) holds.\nThe analog of the Unruh effect in Schwarzschild spacetime was first derived by Hartle and Hawking (1976)\nusing analytic properties of the time-ordered two-point\nfunction for scalar and other free fields. They showed\nthat the physically-acceptable20 vacuum state invariant under the time-translation in the Kruskal extension (Kruskal, 1960) of Schwarzschild spacetime with\nmass M is a thermal state of temperature 1/8\u03c0M .\nThis result obviously has very close connection to the\nHawking effect (Hawking, 1974). A similar method was\nused by Gibbons and Hawking (1977) to show that the\nphysically-acceptable de Sitter-invariant vacuum state of\nthe free scalar field in de Sitter spacetime with Hubble\nconstant H is a thermal state of temperature H/2\u03c0 of the\ntheory inside the cosmological horizon with the de Sitter boost generator fixing the horizon as the Hamiltonian. Narnhofer et al. (1996) found that an accelerated\ndetector with acceleration a in de Sitter spacetime responds as if it was in a thermal bath of temperature\n(H 2 + a2 )1/2 /2\u03c0, and Deser and Levin (1997) obtained\na similar result in anti-de Sitter spacetime. Interestingly, they found that the temperature is equal to the\nUnruh temperature corresponding to the acceleration of\nthe detector in 5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in\nwhich (anti-)de Sitter spacetime is embedded. Jacobson\n(1998) gives a simple explanation of these results, and\nBuchholz and Schlemmer (2007) discuss them in the context of their definition of a local temperature. For some\nwork related to the response rate of the Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector in de Sitter spacetime, see, e.g., Higuchi (1987)\nand Garbrecht and Prokopec (2004a,b). The BisognanoWichmann result was also extended to Schwarzschild and\nde Sitter spacetimes by Sewell as mentioned before.\nKay and Wald (1991) proved the analog of the Unruh effect in a class of spacetimes with bifurcate Killing\nhorizons (Boyer, 1969) adopting the viewpoint that\nHadamard states are the only physical states for the free\nscalar field theory. They showed that the Wightman two-\n\n20\n\nThe condition for \"physical acceptability\" here is essentially\nthe so-called Hadamard condition.\nSee Wald (1978) and\nFulling et al. (1978) for an early use of this condition.\n\n\f19\npoint function \u2206(x; x\u2032 ) on the horizon satisfies\n1\n1\n\u03b4 2 (s, s\u2032 )\n4\u03c0 (U \u2212 U \u2032 \u2212 i\u03b5)2\n(2.187)\nwith x = (U, s), where s parametrizes the null geodesics\non the Killing horizon and where U is an affine parameter\non each geodesic, for a Hadamard state invariant under\nthe Killing symmetry. This formula allowed them to show\nthat, if such a state exists, it must be unique. Then they\napplied essentially the same argument as for the massless\nscalar field theory in the two-dimensional Rindler wedges\nto derive the Unruh-like effect.

APPLICATIONS\n\nIn this section we review some works using the Unruh\neffect to examine some selected phenomena. We begin by\ndiscussing each phenomenon using plain quantum field\ntheory adapted to inertial observers, and then we show\nhow the same observables can be recalculated from the\npoint of view of Rindler observers with the help of the\nUnruh effect. The first example is connected with the excitation of accelerated detectors and atoms, the second\none with the weak decay of non-inertial protons and the\nthird one with the interpretation of the radiation emitted\nby charges from the point of view of uniformly accelerated observers. In particular we clarify the traditional\nquestion whether or not uniformly accelerated charges\nemit radiation from the point of view coaccelerated observers.\nA. Unruh-DeWitt detectors\n\nModels of photon detectors have been discussed for\nsome time in quantum optics (Glauber, 1963). Unruh\n(1976) has introduced a detector model consisting of a\nsmall box containing a non-relativistic particle satisfying\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The system is said to have detected a quantum if the particle in the box jumps from\nthe ground state to some excited state. In the same paper, Unruh also discusses a relativistic detector model\n[see also Sanchez (1981) for a similar model]. Here, we\nconsider in more detail the detector model introduced\nby DeWitt (1979), which consists of a two-level point\nmonopole. We call generically two-level point monopoles\nas Unruh-DeWitt detectors following the literature. A\ndiscussion on particle detectors with finite spatial extent\ncan be found in Grove and Ottewill (1983).\nParticle detectors have often been used to probe the\nUnruh thermal bath. Sometimes, however, distinct detector designs may lead to contrasting conclusions about\nthe same given feature of the bath. For instance,\nIsrael and Nester (1983), Sanchez (1985), Hinton et al.\n(1983) and Hinton (1983) have argued that the Unruh\n\nthermal bath is anisotropic while Kolbenstvedt (1987),\nGerlach (1983) and Grove and Ottewill (1985) have argued the opposite. It is not surprising that, in general,\ndirectionally sensitive detectors will respond differently\nif they are given distinct orientations. Nevertheless, the\nUnruh thermal bath is as isotropic as a thermal bath in\nequilibrium in a general static spacetime can be in the\nsense that Killing observers will see no net energy flux,\netc. in any space direction, as is well known. In general,\nthe temperature \u03b2 \u22121 |i measured by a Killing observer following a curve i generated by a Killing vector will be position dependent. Two Killing observers following curves\ni = 1, 2 will have their temperatures related as\n\u03b2 \u22121 |1 /\u03b2 \u22121 |2 = [(\u03b6\u03bc \u03b6 \u03bc )|2 /(\u03b6\u03bc \u03b6 \u03bc )|1 ]1/2 ,\nwhere \u03b6 \u03bc is the Killing vector tangent to the world line\nof the corresponding observer (Tolman, 1934).\nLet us consider a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector in\nMinkowski spacetime. The detector will be represented\nby a Hermitian operator m\u0302 acting on a two-dimensional\nHilbert space. The excited state, |Ei, and the unexcited\nstate, |E0 i, are assumed to be eigenstates of the detector's Hamiltonian \u0124:\n\u0124|Ei = E|Ei, \u0124|E0 i = E0 |E0 i\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith eigenvalues E and E0 , respectively (E > E0 ). The\nmonopole is time evolved as usual:\nm\u0302(\u03c4 ) \u2261 ei\u0124\u03c4 m\u03020 e\u2212i\u0124\u03c4 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the detector's proper time. The matrix element q \u2261 hE|m\u03020 |E0 i depends on the detector design.21\nNow, let us couple our Unruh-DeWitt detector to a\nreal massive scalar field \u03a6\u0302(x) satisfying the Klein-Gordon\nequation \u0003\u03a6\u0302 + m2 \u03a6\u0302 = 0 through the interaction action\nZ \u221e\n\u015cI =\nd\u03c4 m\u0302(\u03c4 ) \u03a6\u0302[x(\u03c4 )],\n(3.3)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere x (\u03c4 ) is the detector's world line. Next, we analyze the response of the detector from the point of view\nof inertial and Rindler observers separately. Related investigations for detectors coupled with electromagnetic\nand Dirac fields can be found in Boyer (1980, 1984) and\nIyer and Kumar (1980), respectively.\n1. Uniformly accelerated detectors in Minkowski vacuum:\nInertial observer perspective\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, x\u03bc = (t, x, y, z), of\nMinkowski spacetime the world line x\u03bc = x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) of a uniformly accelerated detector along the z-axis with proper\n\n21\n\nTwo-level point monopoles have been also successfully\nused to model the excitation and deexcitation of atoms\n(Audretsch and M\u00fcller, 1994b; Zhu and Yu, 2007).\n\n\f20\nwith \u2206E \u2261 E \u2212 E0 . We have adopted here the subscript M to label states defined by inertial observers in\nMinkowski spacetime. (Note here that we are using the\nconvention that space components of the momentum k \u03bc\nare given with lower indices. That is, kx , ky and kz\nare the x- y- and z-components, respectively, of the contravariant vector k \u03bc .) We note that because Eq. (3.3) is\nlinear in \u03a6\u0302[x(\u03c4 )], the detector excitation is accompanied\nby the emission of a particle23 with momentum k. By\nusing Eq. (3.8) in Eq.

To\nobtain explicitly the excitation rate per unit time, the\ntotal time RT must be canceled by factoring out the diver\u221e\ngent part \u2212\u221e d\u03c4 from the integrals above. To this end,\nwe first note that the momentum of the emitted particle\nis boosted due to the nonzero velocity of the detector,\nwhich is \u03c4 -dependent. Hence, it is expected that the integrand can be made \u03c4 -independent by boosting back the\nmomentum variables. Motivated by this physical picture,\nwe introduce a new momentum variable as\nkz 7\u2192 k \u2032 z \u2261 kz cosh a\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c9 sinh a\u03c4,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich can be inverted as\n\u2032\n\nk \u2032 z 7\u2192 kz = k \u2032 z cosh a\u03c4 + \u03c9 \u2032 sinh a\u03c4.\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nHere \u03c9 \u2261 [(k z ) +\n\n2\nk\u22a5\n\n2 1/2\n\n+m ]\n\n(3.11)\n\ncan be expressed as\n\n\u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 cosh a\u03c4 \u2212 kz sinh a\u03c4,\np\nwhere k\u22a5 \u2261\n(kx )2 + (ky )2 . It can be shown that\ndk \u2032 z /\u03c9 \u2032 = dkz /\u03c9.

Next, we shall reproduce this detector response from the point of view of Rindler observers and discuss it.\n\nthe point of view of uniformly accelerated observers is\nthe Rindler wedge. We choose the right Rindler wedge\n(z > |t|) to work with, where we recall that it has a\nglobal timelike isometry associated with the Killing field\nz\u2202/\u2202t + t\u2202/\u2202z. By covering it with Rindler coordinates\n(\u03c4, \u03be, y, z) (\u2212\u221e < \u03c4, \u03be, x, y < +\u221e), which are related\nwith (t, x, y, z) by Eq. (2.36), we obtain the line element\nof the Rindler wedge as written in Eq. (2.37).\nThe world lines of the Rindler observers are given by\n\u03be, x, y = const and are hyperbolas in the two-dimensional\ndiagram of Minkowski spacetime with x and y suppressed (see Fig. 5). The corresponding four-velocity\nand four-acceleration are u\u03bc = e\u2212a\u03be (1, 0, 0, 0) and a\u03bc =\ne\u22122a\u03be (0, a, 0, 0), respectively, where a\u03bc = u\u03bd \u2207\u03bd u\u03bc [see,\ne.g., Wald (1984)]. Thus,\nthe proper acceleration of the\n\u221a\nRindler observers is \u2212a\u03bc a\u03bc = ae\u2212a\u03be = const. Our uniformly accelerated detector with proper acceleration a\nwill lie at \u03be = 0 (for some x, y = const).\nNext, we expand \u03a6\u0302(x) in terms of positive- and\nnegative-energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian \u0124 =\ni\u2202/\u2202\u03c4 , associated with the Rindler observers, as [see\nSec.

(3.16) in \u015cI as given\nin Eq. (3.3). The differential probability associated with\nthis amplitude is\n2 2\ndW em = |excAem\n\u03c9k\u22a5 | d k\u22a5 d\u03c9.\n\n(3.20)\n\nNow, we should take into account the fact that due to\nthe Unruh effect the Minkowski vacuum corresponds to\na thermal bath of Rindler particles. We emphasize that\nthe Minkowski vacuum is indistinguishable from the thermal bath built on the Rindler vacuum as long as the detector stays in the Rindler wedge since the Minkowski\nvacuum is a linear combination of products of the left\nand right Rindler states. For this reason, the detector's\nexcitation rate with simultaneous emission of a Rindler\nparticle into the Minkowski vacuum is given by Eq. (3.20)\ncombined with the proper thermal factor [see Eq. (4.9)\nin Higuchi et al. (1992a) for more details]:\nZ\nexc em\n\u22121\nR =T\ndW em [1 + n(\u03c9)],\n(3.21)\nwhere\nn(\u03c9) = 1/ [exp(\u03b2\u03c9) \u2212 1]\n\n(3.22)\n\nis the Rindler scalar particle number density in the momentum space. Here \u03b2 \u22121 = a/2\u03c0 is the Unruh temperature as measured by Rindler observers at \u03be = 0. The first\nand second terms in the square brackets in Eq. (3.21) are\nassociated with spontaneous and induced emission, respectively.\nSimilarly, one can calculate the detector's excitation\nrate with simultaneous absorption of a Rindler particle\nfrom the Unruh thermal bath as\nZ\nexc abs\nR = T \u22121 dW abs n(\u03c9),\n(3.23)\nwhere\n2 2\ndW abs \u2261 |excAabs\n\u03c9k\u22a5 | d k\u22a5 d\u03c9\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u2261 ihE| \u2297 h0R |\u015cI |\u03c9k\u22a5 R i \u2297 |E0 i\n\n(3.25)\n\nand\nexc abs\nA\u03c9k\u22a5\n\nis the excitation amplitude with absorption of a Rindler\nparticle |\u03c9k\u22a5 R i.\nThe excitation amplitudes (3.19)\nand (3.25) can be shown to be\nZ \u221e\nexc em(abs)\nA\u03c9k\u22a5\n=q\nd\u03c4 exp[ik\u22a5 * x\u22a5 + i(\u2206E + (\u2212)\u03c9)\u03c4 ]\n\u0014\n\nsinh(\u03c0\u03c9/a)\n\u00d7\n4\u03c0 4 a\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u00151/2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n(k\u22a5 + m2 )1/2 ea\u03be\nKi\u03c9/a\na\n\n(3.26)\n\nup to some multiplicative phase. It is easy to verify in\nthis case that excAem\n\u03c9k\u22a5 = 0, as expected, since uniformly\naccelerated detectors are static according to Rindler observers. Hence, according to these observers the only\n\ncontribution to the detector response comes from the\nabsorption of Rindler particles from the Unruh thermal\nbath.\nNow, since in first order of perturbation there is no\ninterference, the total detector excitation rate in the\nMinkowski vacuum is\nexc\n\nR =exc Rem +exc Rabs .\n\n(3.27)\n\nBy using Eq. (3.26) to calculate Eq. (3.27), we get\nEq. (3.15), as expected. Of course, inertial and Rindler\nobservers must agree on the value of scalar observables,\nsuch as the proper excitation rate of a given detector,\nalthough they can differ in how they describe the phenomenon. Because inertial and Rindler observers would\nexpand the quantum fields with different sets of normal\nmodes, they would end up extracting different particle\ncontents from the same field theory. As a result, it is natural for inertial and Rindler observers to describe the detector excitation as being accompanied by the emission of\na Minkowski particle and by the absorption of a Rindler\nparticle from the Unruh thermal bath (Unruh and Wald,\n1984), respectively. This conclusion can be generalized\nfor detectors confined in the Rindler wedge following general world lines by saying that the detector excitation\nwhich is associated with the emission of a Minkowski particle as described by inertial observers corresponds in this\ncase to the absorption or emission of a Rindler particle\nfrom or to the Unruh thermal bath according to Rindler\nobservers (Matsas, 1996).\nLet us comment on one possible source of confusion\nconcerning the Unruh-DeWitt detector. A naive (and\nwrong) application of the equivalence principle might\nlead to the conclusion that an inertial detector which\nhas the same velocity as an accelerated one at a certain\ntime would detect Unruh radiation. This is of course not\nthe case: no detector in an inertial motion detects any\nUnruh radiation.\nBefore proceeding further, we note for later purposes\nthat in the particular case with m = 0, Eq. (3.15) takes\nthe form\nexc m=0\n\nR\n\n=\n\n|q|2 \u2206E\n.\n2\u03c0 e\u03b2\u2206E \u2212 1\n\n(3.28)\n\n3. Rindler particles with frequency \u03c9 < m\n\nHere we discuss in more detail the existence of Rindler\nparticles with frequencies \u03c9 < m, which was crucial in the\nwhole discussion above (notice, e.g., that the range of the\n\u03c9 integrations in Eqs. (3.21) and (3.23) is 0 < \u03c9 < +\u221e).\nThe standard theory of quantum fields uses the fact that\nMinkowski spacetime is invariant under time and space\ntranslations. The linear three-momentum (kx , ky , kz ) associated with the translational isometries on the spacelike hypersurfaces t = const constitutes a suitable set of\nquantum numbers to label free particles.\np In this simple\ncase, the dispersion relation E \u2261 ~\u03c9 = |p c|2 + m2 c4\n\n\f23\n\nds2 = (1 \u2212 2M/r) dt2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2M/r)\u22121 dr2 .\n\n(3.29)\n\nThis can be seen as describing a two-dimensional black\nhole25 with mass M . Close to the horizon, r \u2248 2M , it\ncan be written as\nds2 = (\u03c1/4M )2 dt2 \u2212 d\u03c12 ,\n\n(3.30)\n\np\nwhere \u03c1(r) \u2261 8M (r \u2212 2M ). (Note that in these coordinates the horizon is at \u03c1 = 0.) One can identify Eq. (3.30)\nwith the line element of the Rindler wedge (2.37) with\nx, y = const by letting t = 4M a\u03c4 and \u03c1 = ea\u03be /a provided that 0 < \u03c1 < +\u221e and \u2212\u221e < t < +\u221e.\nFrom here to the end of this subsection we shall be\nconsidering the spacetime of the Rindler wedge with line\nelement (3.30), where 0 < \u03c1 < +\u221e and \u2212\u221e < t < +\u221e.\nNow, let us choose a fiducial observer at \u03c1 = \u03c10 = 4M ,\nwhose proper time is t [see Eq. (3.30)], with respect to\nwhom the particle's energy is to be measured. He/she\ndefines the total probability P\u03c9 (\u03c1d ) of detecting a particle\nat some point \u03c1 = \u03c1d with energy \u03c9 per (detector) proper\n\n25\n\nThe vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for a massless scalar field in this spacetime was analyzed by Davies et al. (1976) [see also Davies (1976) and\nDavies and Fulling (1977a)].\nSee Christensen and Fulling\n(1977) for a comprehensive discussion on this issue and\nCandelas and Dowker (1979) for further considerations.\n\n1\n0.8\n(dP\u03c9 / d\u03c1d)/m\n\nimposes a simple constraint between the particle mass\nm, momentum p and energy E, and, thus, free particles\nwith well-defined linear momenta must have total energy\nE \u2265 m c2 . Moreover, in the classical context of General\nRelativity, the detection in loco of point particles satisfying E < mc2 by direct capture is ruled out by the\nfact that an observer with four-velocity u\u03bc intercepting\na particle with four-momentum p\u03bc = mv \u03bc assigns to the\nparticle an energy E = mv \u03bc u\u03bc \u2265 mc2 .\nOn the other hand, it is well known that the field quantization carried over arbitrary spacetime does not lead\nin general to any dispersion relation connecting the frequency with other quantum numbers, avoiding thus the\nflat spacetime constraint E \u2265 mc2 . This can be understood by recalling that, strictly speaking, the concept\nof point particle has no place in Quantum Field Theory.\nThis raises the following question: What is the probability density associated with the detection of particles\nwith E < mc2 , i.e. \u03c9 < m, at different space points of\nthe Rindler wedge? By answering this question, we can\nalso extract some information about the particle distribution of the Hawking radiation near the event horizon\nof black holes. Indeed, much insight into the Hawking\neffect can be obtained in the simplified context provided\nby the Rindler wedge as we shall see next. [We refer the\nreader to Casti\u00f1eiras et al. (2002) for more details.]\nLet us start by considering the line element of a twodimensional Schwarzschild spacetime:\n\n\u03c9/m=0.5\n\n\u03c9/m=1.0\n\n0.6\n\u03c9/m=1.5\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nm\u03c1d\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFIG. 6 We plot the probability density dP\u03c9 /d\u03c1d for different\n\u03c9/m ratios, where we have let M m = 1/4. We note that the\nsmaller the \u03c9/m ratio, the closer to the horizon (on average)\nthe particle lies, where the \"gravitational potential\" is lower.\ntot\ntime stot\nd as \u0393\u03c9 (\u03c1d ) \u2261 P\u03c9 (\u03c1d )/sd . Then, the normalized\nprobability density is\n\ndP\u03c9\n\u2261 \u0393\u03c9 (\u03c1d )\nd\u03c1d\n\n\u0014Z\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u0393\u03c9 (\u03c1\u2032d )d\u03c1\u2032d\n\n\u0015\u22121\n\n,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere (dP\u03c9 /d\u03c1d )d\u03c1d is the probability that a particle\nwith energy \u03c9 is found between \u03c1d and \u03c1d + d\u03c1d . Observers far away from the horizon will be able to interact\nonly with the \"tail\" of the \"wave functions\" associated\nwith particles with small \u03c9/m. The smaller the \u03c9/m, the\nmore difficult it is to detect these particles.\nNow, in order to interpret Eq. (3.31) in the frame work\nof General Relativity, let us first consider a row of detectors, each of them lying at different \u03c1d , and define the\naverage detection position\nZ +\u221e\nd\u03c1d \u03c1d dP\u03c9 /d\u03c1d .\n(3.32)\nh\u03c1d i \u2261\n0\n\nBy using Eq. (3.31), this can be shown to be (see Fig. 6)\n\u03c0 tanh(4\u03c0M \u03c9)(64M 2\u03c9 2 + 1)\n64mM \u03c9\n\u2248 \u03c0 M \u03c9/m\n(\u03c9 \u226b a),\n\nh\u03c1d i =\n\n(3.33)\n\nwhere a \u2261 1/4M is the proper acceleration of the fiducial\nobserver. On the other hand, from General Relativity, a\nclassical particle with mass m lying at rest at some point\n\u03c1p has, according to our fiducial observer at \u03c10 = 4M ,\nenergy \u03c9 = m\u03c1p /4M . By considering that the particle\nmay have some kinetic energy in addition, the total energy would be \u03c9 \u2265 m\u03c1p /4M . From this equation, we\nobtain\n\u03c1p \u2264 4M \u03c9/m \u2261 \u03c1max\n.\np\n\n(3.34)\n\nThis is expected to agree with h\u03c1d i, i.e. h\u03c1d i \u2264 \u03c1max\n,\np\nat least in the \"high-frequency\" regime \u03c9 \u226b a (where\nthe quantum and classical behaviors may be compared).\nThis conclusion is indeed in agreement with Eqs.

(We have let\nmM = 10 here but this nice agreement is verified for any\nmM .)\n\nand (3.34) as seen in Fig. 7. In summary, the smaller the\n\u03c9/m ratio, the more likely the observer is to detect the\nparticle closer to the horizon.\n4. Static detectors in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles\n\nNow, we shall show explicitly that the response rate\n(3.15) does not correspond to the one obtained when the\ndetector lies at rest in a plain thermal bath of Minkowski\nparticles heated up to the Unruh temperature \u03b2 \u22121 =\na/(2\u03c0). In the latter case, the excitation rate is obtained\nby replacing Eq. (3.7) by\nZ\nexc \u03b2\n2\nexc abs 2\nR \u2261 T \u22121 d3 k[|excAem\nk | [1 + n(\u03c9)] + | Ak | n(\u03c9)],\n(3.35)\n\nwhere n(\u03c9) = 1/(exp(\u03b2\u03c9) \u2212 1) and\nexc em\nAk \u2261 ihE| \u2297hk M |\u015cI |0M i \u2297 |E0 i,\nexc abs\nAk \u2261 ihE| \u2297h0M |\u015cI |k M i \u2297 |E0 i\n\nare the excitation amplitudes with emission and absorption of Minkowski particles |k M i, respectively. In this\ncase, the excitation amplitudes can be shown to be (up\nto an arbitrary multiplicative phase)\n\u221a\nexc em(abs)\nAk\n= q\u03b4(\u03c9 + (\u2212)\u2206E)/ 4\u03c0\u03c9 ,\n(3.36)\nwhere we have assumed with no loss of generality that\nthe detector is at the origin x = 0. Clearly, excAem\nk = 0.\nHence, the only contribution to the detector response is\nassociated with the absorption of a Minkowski particle.\nBy substituting Eq. (3.36) in Eq. (3.35), we obtain\n|q|2 \u2206E \u03b8(\u2206E \u2212 m)\nR =\n.\n2\u03c0\ne\u03b2\u2206E \u2212 1\n\nexc \u03b2\n\ngap is large enough to absorb massive scalar particles\nfrom the thermal bath. Clearly excR\u03b2 in Eq. (3.37) with\n\u03b2 \u22121 = a/(2\u03c0) and excR in Eq. (3.15) are distinct. Indeed,\nthere is no a priori reason why they should be the same.\nIncidentally, in the case m = 0, Eqs. (3.37) and (3.28)\nequal each other. However, this is a coincidence, which\nhas to do with the particular design of the detector and\nnot with the Unruh effect. As we have seen, what the\nUnruh effect does say is something else. In particular,\nwe have shown in Sec. III.A.2 how to recover Eq. (3.15)\nfrom the point of view of Rindler observers.\nIn spite of the model dependence of the response rate,\nthe Unruh effect allows one to establish a relationship\nbetween the excitation and deexcitation rates (assuming\nthat they are well defined), which is independent of the\ndetector model. Because of unitarity, the absolute value\nof the excitation amplitude (associated with the absorption of a Rindler particle),\n|excAabs | \u2261 |hE| \u2297 h0R |\u015cI |\u03c9k\u22a5 R i \u2297 |E0 i| \u221d \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206E),\n(3.38)\nmust equal the absolute value of the deexcitation amplitude (associated with the emission of a Rindler particle),\n|deexcAem | \u2261 |hE0 | \u2297 h\u03c9k\u22a5 R |\u015cI |0R i \u2297 |Ei| \u221d \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206E).\n(3.39)\nHence, we obtain from the discussion in Sec. III.A.2 that\nthe ratio of the excitation and deexcitation rates must be\ngiven by\nexc\n\nR\n\ndeexcR\n\nThe presence of the step function \u03b8(\u2206E \u2212 m) expresses\nthe fact that the detector can only be excited if its energy\n\nn(\u2206E)\n= e\u2212\u03b2\u2206E .\n1 + n(\u2206E)\n\n(3.40)\n\nThis quite universal relation is also called principle of\ndetailed balance, and clearly holds for detectors lying at\nrest in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles at the same\ntemperature26 provided that \u2206E \u2265 m. For \u2206E < m,\nthe ratio excR/deexcR is not well defined for the thermal\nbath in Minkowski spacetime since the excitation and\ndeexcitation rates vanish. It is worthwhile to emphasize, however, that deviations from the hyperbolic motion\nbecause of backreaction or other effects will in general\ndisturb Eq. (3.40) with no contradiction to the Unruh\neffect, contrary to some recent claims (Belinskii et al.,\n1997; Fedotov et al., 1999).\n5. About the discussion whether or not uniformly accelerated\nsources radiate\n\nSome controversy has appeared in the literature about\nwhether or not uniformly accelerated detectors and\n\n26\n\n(3.37)\n\n=\n\nBoyer (1980, 1984) has concluded in the context of stochastic electrodynamics that a classical electric dipole oscillator accelerating through classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation\nresponds as would a dipole oscillator in an inertial frame in classical thermal radiation with temperature a/(2\u03c0) in agreement\nwith Eq. (3.40) [see also Cole (1985)].\n\n\f25\nsources emit radiation according to inertial observers.27\nThis is sometimes called Unruh radiation (although, this\nterminology has also been used to mean something else\n[see Sec. IV.D]). Indeed, the conclusion that the excitation of a uniformly accelerated detector is accompanied\nby the emission of a Minkowski particle according to inertial observers and absorption of a Rindler particle from\nthe Unruh thermal bath according to Rindler observers\n(Unruh and Wald, 1984) was not unanimously accepted\nin the beginning (Padmanabhan, 1985). Grove (1986)\nclaimed that a constantly accelerated object would emit\nnegative- rather than positive-energy radiation as seen\nby inertial observers. Similar conclusions were reached\nby Massar et al. (1993). Later, the excitation of uniformly accelerated detectors in the Minkowski vacuum\nwas said to give rise to no energy flux28 according to\ninertial observers, supporting previous conclusion due\nto Raine et al. (1991). More recently Parentani (1995)\nand Massar and Parentani (1996) stated that, although\nthe mean flux vanishes, once the thermal equilibrium is\nreached, each detector transition is indeed accompanied\nby the emission of a Minkowski particle.\nThe controversy above was revisited by Unruh (1992),\nwho concluded that uniformly accelerated oscillators do\nalter the measurable properties of the field. Ascribing these changes to \"radiation\" or \"vacuum fluctuation\"\nwould be a terminology issue. This viewpoint is in agreement with Audretsch and M\u00fcller (1994a) who argued\nthat the key to the seemingly contradictory results lies\nin the distinction between the different questions stated\nimplicitly in the various approaches.29\n\n6. Other results concerning the Unruh-DeWitt detector\n\nThe emission rates obtained in the previous subsections, which use detectors accelerated uniformly for\nall times, should be seen as approximations to those\nobtained in real physical situations where the detectors are accelerated and interacting for long enough.\nSvaiter and Svaiter (1992) considered the Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector that was turned on only for a finite time. This\nmodel might appear physical but they obtained a transition probability which was logarithmically divergent\nalthough the transition rate, the time-derivative of the\ntransition probability, was found to be finite. [See also\nSriramkumar and Padmanabhan (1996).]\nIn order to find the cause of this divergence and confirm that the transition rate obtained with uniform ac-\n\n27\n28\n\n29\n\nSee Sec. III.C.1 for some related remarks concerning electric\ncharges.\nSee, e.g., Ford and O'Connell (2006); Hinterleitner (1993);\nHu and Roura (2004); Hu et al. (2004).\nA reply to\nHu and Roura (2004) can be found in Scully et al. (2004). See\nalso Sec. IV.C for some further remarks.\nMore discussions on this issue can be found in Lin and Hu (2006).\n\nceleration is a good approximation to that for a detector model turned on only for a finite time, Higuchi et al.\n(1993) modified the interaction action (3.3) as follows:\nZ \u221e\n\u015cI =\nd\u03c4 c(\u03c4 )m\u0302(\u03c4 )\u03a6\u0302[x(\u03c4 )]\n(3.41)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the function\n\uf8f1\n\u03c4 < \u2212T\n\uf8f2 e\u03b1(\u03c4 +T )\n1\n\u2212T \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 T ,\nc(\u03c4 ) \u2261\n\uf8f3 \u2212\u03b1(\u03c4 \u2212T )\ne\n\u03c4 >T\n\n(3.42)\n\nwith \u03b1 = const, has been inserted to switch on and off\nthe detector continuously as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, respectively. The field \u03a6\u0302(x) is assumed to be a massless\nscalar field for simplicity. The excitation rate is calculated in the Rindler frame. Eq. (3.27) for the interaction\n(3.41) takes the form\nexc\n\nRT = excRTem +exc RTabs\n= |q|2 (I sp + I in + I abs )/(4\u03c0 2 T tot ), (3.43)\n\nwhere T tot \u2261 2T .

It is easy to see that\nthe integrands for I sp , I in and I abs in Eqs. (3.44)-(3.46)\ndo not diverge at any value of \u03c9. Also, the integrands\nfor I in and I abs tend to zero exponentially as \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e,\nand the leading term of the asymptotic expansion (for\n\u03c9 \u226b \u2206E, \u03b1, a) of the integrand for I sp is 4\u03b12 \u03c9 \u22123 cos2 \u03c9T .\nThus, excRT in Eq. (3.43) is clearly finite. Now, suppose\nwe switch on and off the detector instantaneously, in such\na way that it only interacts with the field during the\ninterval \u2212T < \u03c4 < T . This setup corresponds to the limit\n\u03b1 \u2192 +\u221e [see Eq. (3.42)]. In this regime the integrand\nfor I sp behaves asymptotically like 4\u03c9 \u22121 sin2 \u03c9T , giving\nrise to a logarithmic ultraviolet divergence in excRT found\nby Svaiter and Svaiter. In a physical situation where we\nhave a finite \u03b1 and large T (i.e. T \u226b a\u22121 , \u03b1\u22121 , \u2206E \u22121 ),\none finds\nexc\n\nRT \u2248\n\n|q|2 \u2206E\n,\n2\u03c0 e\u03b2\u2206E \u2212 1\n\n(3.48)\n\n\f26\nrecovering the Planckian excitation rate (3.28). Thus,\nthe logarithmic divergence appears when we take the\n\u03b1 \u2192 +\u221e limit with finite T . This divergence would not\nappear if we took T \u2192 +\u221e from the beginning. In this\ncase the absence of the logarithmic divergence could be\nattributed to the fact that the switching on and off would\nbe moved away to infinite past and future, respectively.\nThe good ultraviolet behavior of the detector's total\nexcitation probability excRT does not depend sensitively\non the particular choice of the function c(\u03c4 ) provided\nthat c(\u03c4 ) is at least continuous. It would be interesting to see if the results obtained for finite-time detectors\nand for finite-lifetime observers (Martinetti and Rovelli,\n2003) are related.\nRecently Louko and Satz (2006) have found a formula\nfor the excitation rate of the Unruh-DeWitt detector with\nany trajectory in Minkowski spacetime for the massless\nscalar field, building on works by Schlicht (2004) and\nLanglois (2005, 2006). If the trajectory is x\u03bc (\u03c4 ), where\n\u03c4 is the proper time, and if the detector is turned on at\n\u03c4 = \u03c40 , then the Louko-Satz formula for the excitation\nrate at proper time \u03c4 is\n\u001a\n\u0015\nZ \u03c4 \u2212\u03c40 \u0014\n\u2206E\ncos(s\u2206E)\n1\n1\n2\nRLS = |q| \u2212\n+ 2\nds 2 \u2212\n4\u03c0\n2\u03c0 0\ns\n(\u2206x)2\n\u001b\n1\n+ 2\n,\n(3.49)\n2\u03c0 (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 )\nwhere \u2206x\u03bc \u2261 x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) \u2212 x\u03bc (\u03c4 \u2212 s). The transition probability obtained by integrating RLS from \u03c40 to a given\ntime is indeed logarithmically divergent because of the\nlast term. In the limit \u03c40 \u2192 \u2212\u221e they find\n\u001a\n\u2206E\n\u03b8(\u2212\u2206E)\nlim RLS = |q|2 \u2212\n\u03c40 \u2192\u2212\u221e\n2\u03c0\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n1\n1\n1\n+ 2\n,\nds cos(s\u2206E) 2 \u2212\n2\u03c0 0\ns\n(\u2206x)2\n(3.50)\nwhere \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside function. Louko and Satz\nhave used this formula to compute the excitation rate\nfor a trajectory which is inertial for \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and uniformly accelerated with acceleration a for \u03c4 \u2192 +\u221e, verifying that it vanishes as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and converges to the\nrate (3.28) as \u03c4 \u2192 +\u221e.30 Very recent discussions on the\nexcitation of Unruh-DeWitt detectors with arbitrary trajectories can be found in Obadia and Milgrom (2007) and\nSatz (2007). We also note that Bi\u00e8vre and Merkli (2006)\nhave shown that a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector will asymptotically have the Gibbs state with\nthe Unruh temperature irrespective of its initial state.\n\n30\n\nNote that RLS and its \u03c40 \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit can become negative at\nsome \u03c4 . This may be due to the fact that quantum interference\nprevents one from determining the exact time when the detector\nclicks.\n\n7. Circularly moving detectors with constant velocity in the\nMinkowski vacuum\n\nAs we have seen, the Unruh effect is concerned with\nuniformly accelerated observers. In spite of this, some\ninteresting questions can be addressed for the case of observers in uniform circular motion.\nLet us start by considering a circularly moving\nUnruh-DeWitt detector31 (Letaw and Pfautsch, 1980) in\nMinkowski spacetime32 at the radius r = r0 with angular velocity \u03a9 \u2261 d\u03b8/dt > 0. Using the interaction\naction (3.3), we may write the detector excitation amplitude as\nexc\n\nAk = ihE| \u2297hk M |\u015cI |0M i \u2297 |E0 i\nZ \u221e\n= iq\nd\u03c4 exp(i\u2206E \u03c4 )hk M |\u03a6\u0302[x\u03bc (\u03c4 )]|0M i,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(3.51)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the detector proper time. Thus, the proper\nexcitation rate (3.7) can be given as (Brout et al., 1995)\nZ \u221e\nexc m=0\nRcirc = |q|2\nd\u03c3 exp(\u2212i\u2206E \u03c3) G+ [x(\u03c4 ), x(\u03c4 \u2032 )] ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(3.52)\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 . Here\nG+ [x\u03bc (\u03c4 ), x\u03bc (\u03c4 \u2032 )] = h0M |\u03a6\u0302[x\u03bc (\u03c4 )]\u03a6\u0302[x\u03bc (\u03c4 \u2032 )]|0M i (3.53)\nis the (positive-frequency) Wightman function [see, e.g.,\nFulling (1989)] for the massless scalar field in Minkowski\nspacetime. In Cartesian coordinates this is written as\nG+ [x\u03bc (\u03c4 ), x\u03bc (\u03c4 \u2032 )] = \u22121/(4\u03c0 2 [(t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2212 i\u01eb)2 \u2212 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )2\n\u2212(y \u2212 y \u2032 )2 \u2212 (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 ]),\n(3.54)\nwhich can be derived using the field expansion (3.5)-(3.6)\nin terms of positive- and negative-energy modes with respect to inertial observers, as is well known. We may\nwrite the world line of this detector as\nt = \u03b3\u03c4, x = r0 cos(\u03a9\u03b3\u03c4 ), y = r0 sin(\u03a9\u03b3\u03c4 ), z = const,\n(3.55)\nwhere we impose the condition r0 \u03a9 < 1 so that the world\nline is timelike and \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 r02 \u03a92 )\u22121/2 is the Lorentz\nfactor. The proper acceleration of such a detector is a \u2261\n\u221a\n\u2212a\u03bc a\u03bc = \u03a92 \u03b3 2 r0 . Then, the proper excitation rate can\nbe written as\nZ\n|q|2 \u221e\nexc m=0\nRcirc =\nd\u03c3 e\u2212i\u2206E \u03c3\n4\u03c0 2 \u2212\u221e\n\u00d7[\u2212\u03b3 2 (\u03c3 \u2212 i\u01eb)2 + 4r02 sin2 (\u03a9\u03b3\u03c3/2)]\u22121 .

(1987) for some further discussion].

IV.A.\nNow, one could think of recalculating the excitation\nrate above from the point of view of observers corotating with the detector. A major difficulty appears, however. In order to extract a natural particle content from\nthe field theory, a global timelike Killing vector field K\nassociated with the rotating observers would be necessary [see, e.g., Wald (1994)]. If such a Killing vector existed, then the eigenvalue equation iK\u03c6\u00b1 = \u00b1\u03c9\u03c6\u00b1 would\nseparate positive-frequency modes (\u03c6+ ) from negativefrequency ones (\u03c6\u2212 ) (where K is assumed to be future\ndirected).

We notice now that for\nr\u03a9 > 1 , K is spacelike. Thus, K fails to be a global\ntimelike Killing field. If one ignored this fact and used\nK to extract naively the particle content of the field theory, circularly moving observers would end up with identifying their vacuum state with the Minkowski vacuum\nitself (Letaw and Pfautsch, 1980). This would lead to a\npuzzling situation since we know from Eq. (3.56) that\ndetectors carried by circularly moving observers do have\na nonzero excitation rate. Thus, either we have a suitable way to extract the particle content from the theory\n(Ashtekar and Magnon, 1975; Kay, 1978) or it may be\nbetter not to introduce such a concept at all.33\nIn contrast to the case considered above, we now turn\nto a related but quite distinct physical situation, where\nthe detector response can be naturally interpreted in\nterms of the particle content defined by the rotating observers. We consider the rotating detector with angular velocity \u03a9 = const confined inside a limiting surface (Davies et al., 1996; Levin et al., 1993). We assume a cylindrical surface at r = \u03c1 with \u03c1 < 1/\u03a9 and\n\n33\n\n(3.59)\n\nIn order to calculate the response rate (3.52) we substitute the world line of the rotating detector\nt = \u03b3\u03c4, r = r0 = const, \u03b8 = \u03a9t, z = const\n\n(3.64)\n\nin Eq.

(3.65) into Eq. (3.52), we get\nexc m=0\nRcirc\n\n= |q|2\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e X\n+\u221e Z\nX\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n2\ndkz Cmn\nJm\n(\u03b1mn r0 /\u03c1)\n\nm=\u2212\u221e n=1\n+\u221e\n\u2212i[\u2206E+(\u03c9mn \u2212m\u03a9)\u03b3]\u03c3\n\nd\u03c3e\n\n.\n\n(3.66)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe result of the integration over \u03c3 is proportional to\n\u03b4(\u2206E \u2212 (m\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9mn )\u03b3). Assuming \u03a9 > 0, we find that no\ncontribution comes from m \u2264 0 in the sum of Eq. (3.66)\n(where we recall that \u2206E > 0). Now, for m > 0 there\nwill be a lowest value of \u03c9mn for each m, namely \u03b1m1 /\u03c1\n[corresponding to the first (non-vanishing) zero of the\nBessel function Jm (x) and kz = 0]. Then, a necessary\ncondition for a mode with a given m to contribute in the\n\n\f28\nsum is that \u03a9\u03c1 > \u03b1m1 /m. However, since \u03b1mn > m [see,\ne.g., Abramowitz and Stegun (1965)], there is no integer\nvalue for m that satisfies this condition because of our\noriginal constraint that \u03c1 < 1/\u03a9. We conclude, thus, that\nthe detector has a vanishing response when it is confined\ninside the limiting surface. [The same conclusion would\nhold if we had chosen Neumann rather than Dirichlet\nboundary conditions (Davies et al., 1996)].\nNow, let us show that in this case, namely for \u03c1 < 1/\u03a9,\nit is possible to interpret the vanishing response in terms\nof the particle content defined by the rotating observers\nconfined inside the boundary with angular velocity \u03a9.\nThis is so because in this case the Killing vector field K\nassociated with these observers is globally timelike. Let\nus rewrite Eq. (3.59) as\n\u2032\n\n\u0169mnkz = Cmn Jm (\u03b1mn r/\u03c1) eim\u03b8 eikz z e\u2212i\u03c9\u0303mn t\n\n(3.67)\n\nwith \u03c9\u0303mn = \u03c9mn \u2212 m\u03a9 > 0, which are also positivefrequency modes with respect to the corotating observers.\nWe have defined \u03b8\u2032 \u2261 \u03b8\u2212\u03a9t, and t can be interpreted here\nas the proper time of a rotating observer with angular\nvelocity \u03a9 lying at r = 0, i.e. K = \u2202/\u2202t|\u03b8\u2032 =const . Clearly,\nby determining the Bogolubov transformation among the\n\"inertial\" modes (3.59) and \"rotating\" modes (3.67) [see\nEq. (2.20)], we obtain\n\u03b2(i)(i\u2032 ) = (\u0169\u2217(i) , u(i\u2032 ) )KG = 0,\n\n(3.68)\n\nwhere (i) stands for the set (m, n, kz ) . We conclude,\nthus, that there is no mixing between positive- and\nnegative-energy modes between the two sets [see, e.g.,\nBirrell and Davies (1982)]. As a result, the Minkowski\nvacuum coincides with the vacuum state defined by the\nrotating observers, who would correctly conclude that the\nresponse rate of the corotating detectors confined inside\nthe limiting surface vanishes. A similar analysis can be\nperformed for the case of a compact space, like the one\nwith topology S 2 \u00d7 R2 , or the Einstein static universe,\nwherein the field is automatically confined (Davies et al.,\n1996).34\nB. Weak decay of non-inertial protons\n\nAs a second example, we discuss the weak decay of\nnon-inertial protons. Although inertial protons are stable according to the standard particle model (Yao et al.,\n2006), non-inertial protons are not. This is so because\nthe accelerating agent provides the required extra energy\nfor the proton to decay. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe first to consider the weak decay of accelerated protons were Ginzburg and Zharkov (1964), who described\n\n34\n\nOther investigations on the response of particle detectors in\nspacetimes with non-trivial topology and endowed with boundaries can be found in Copeland et al. (1984), Abe (1990),\nLanglois (2005, 2006) and Davies et al. (1989).\n\nthe baryons by classical currents while treating the other\nparticles as quantized fields. At about the same time,\nZharkov (1965) investigated the weak and strong proton\ndecays (and other processes) in the presence of a background electromagnetic field A\u03bc by using the formalism\nof Nikishov and Ritus (1964a,b) [see also Ritus (1969)],\ntreating all particles as quantum fields. More recently\nthe weak decay of non-inertial protons under the influence of a gravitational field was studied by M\u00fcller (1997),\nVanzella and Matsas (2000) and Fregolente et al. (2006).\nHere we review a model of the weak decay of uniformly accelerated protons from the point of view of\ninertial and Rindler observers. For the sake of simplicity we present a model with a two-dimensional\nspacetime and massless neutrinos (using four-component\nspinors for the leptons) (Matsas and Vanzella, 1999;\nVanzella and Matsas, 2001), but a four-dimensional comprehensive calculation with massive neutrinos can be\nfound in Suzuki and Yamada (2003). We evaluate the\nproton proper decay rate with respect to inertial and\nRindler observers and show that the results obtained are\nin agreement when the Unruh effect is taken into account\nin spite of the fact that uniformly accelerated protons are\nstatic according to Rindler observers. It will be interesting to see that what inertial observers interpret as being\n(i) p+ \u2192 n0 e+ \u03bd,\nare interpreted by Rindler observers as being the combination of the following channels\n(ii) p+ e\u2212 \u2192 n0 \u03bd, (iii) p+ \u03bd\u0304 \u2192 n0 e+ , (iv) p+ e\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 \u2192 n0 ,\nwhere the e\u2212 's and \u03bd\u0304's on the left-hand side are Rindler\nelectrons and antineutrinos, respectively, absorbed from\nthe Unruh thermal bath. In our procedure, we take into\naccount the proton-neutron mass difference by introducing a semiclassical rather than classical current. The current is \"classical\" in the sense that the proton-neutron is\nassociated with a well defined world line and \"quantum\"\nin the sense that it behaves as a two-level quantum system.\nThe trajectory of a proton with proper acceleration\na = const along the z-axis in Minkowski\n\u221a spacetime is\ngiven in Cartesian coordinates by z = t2 + a\u22122 . This\ncan be written more simply as \u03c1 = a\u22121 = const, where\nwe are introducing a new set of Rindler coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b7)\nwhich are related with (t, z) by\nt = \u03c1 sinh \u03b7 , z = \u03c1 cosh \u03b7,\n\n(3.69)\n\nand 0 < \u03c1 < +\u221e, \u2212\u221e < \u03b7 < +\u221e [see Eq. (2.34)]. Thus,\nwe describe our uniformly accelerated proton through the\nvector current\nj \u03bc = qu\u03bc \u03b4(\u03c1 \u2212 a\u22121 ),\n\n(3.70)\n\nwhere q will be associated with a small coupling constant\nand u\u03bc is the nucleon's \"two-velocity\": u\u03bc = (a, 0) and\n\n\f29\n\u221a\nu\u03bc = ( a2 t2 + 1, at) in Rindler and Minkowski coordinates, respectively.\nThe current (3.70) is suitable for describing stable accelerated protons but must be improved to allow protondecay processes. For this purpose, we consider the nucleon as a two-level system. In this model, neutrons |ni\nand protons |pi are going to be seen as excited and unexcited states of the nucleon, respectively, and are assumed\nto be eigenstates of the nucleon Hamiltonian \u0124:\n\u0124|ni = mn |ni, \u0124|pi = mp |pi,\n\n(3.71)\n\nwhere mn and mp are the neutron and proton masses,\nrespectively. Accordingly, to consider nucleon decay\nprocesses, we replace q in Eq. (3.70) by the Hermitian\nmonopole\nq\u0302(\u03c4 ) \u2261 ei\u0124\u03c4 q\u03020 e\u2212i\u0124\u03c4 ,\n\n(3.72)\n\nwhere |hmp |q\u03020 |mn i| \u2261 GF , which is dimensionless, plays\nthe role of an effective Fermi constant. As a result, the\ncurrent (3.70) will be replaced by\n\u0135 \u03bc = q\u0302(\u03c4 )u\u03bc \u03b4(\u03c1 \u2212 a\u22121 ).\n\n(3.73)\n\n1.

In the inertial frame,\nthe frequency, momentum and mass m are related in\n\u221a\n(+\u03c9)\nthe usual way as \u03c9 = k 2 + m2 > 0, and \u03c8k\u03c3 and\n(\u2212\u03c9)\n\u03c8k\u03c3 are positive- and negative-frequency solutions of\n(\u00b1\u03c9)\n(\u00b1\u03c9)\nthe Dirac equation i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8k\u03c3 \u2212 m\u03c8k\u03c3 = 0. By using the \u03b3 \u03bc matrices in the Dirac representation [see, e.g.,\nItzykson and Zuber (1980)], we find\n\uf8eb p\n\uf8f6\n\u00b1 (\u03c9 \u00b1 m)/2\u03c9\n\uf8f7\nei(\u2213\u03c9t+kz) \uf8ec\n(\u00b1\u03c9)\n\uf8ec p 0\n\uf8f7 (3.75)\n\u221a\n\u03c8k+ (t, z) =\n\uf8ed\nk/ 2\u03c9(\u03c9 \u00b1 m) \uf8f8\n2\u03c0\n0\nand\n\n(\u00b1\u03c9)\n\n\u03c8k\u2212 (t, z) =\n\nei(\u2213\u03c9t+kz)\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\np 0\n\uf8ec \u00b1 (\u03c9 \u00b1 m)/2\u03c9 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 .

(In this section, we have chosen\nt = const for the hypersurface \u03a3.) Then, the canonical anticommutation relations for fields and conjugate\nmomenta lead to the following simple anticommutation\nrelations for creation and annihilation operators:\n{b\u0302k\u03c3 , b\u0302\u2020k\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 } = {d\u02c6k\u03c3 , d\u02c6\u2020k\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 } = \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 ) \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ,\n\n(3.78)\n\n{b\u0302k\u03c3 , b\u0302k\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 } = {d\u02c6k\u03c3 , d\u02c6k\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 } = {b\u0302k\u03c3 , d\u02c6k\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 } = {b\u0302k\u03c3 , d\u02c6\u2020k\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 } = 0.\n(3.79)\nNext, we model the relevant weak interaction by coupling the electron and neutrino fields, \u03a8\u0302e and \u03a8\u0302\u03bd , minimally to the nucleon current (3.73) using the parityconserving Fermi action\n\u015cI =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u02c6 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8\u0302 ),\n\u02c6 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8\u0302 + \u03a8\u0304\nd2 x \u2212g\u0135\u03bc (\u03a8\u0304\ne\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\ne\n\n(3.80)\n\nwhere g is the determinant of the spacetime metric components g\u03bc\u03bd .

In particular, the mean\nproper lifetime must be the same as the one obtained in\nSec. III.B.1, but the corresponding particle interpretation changes significantly. As will be shown, the proton\ndecay, which is represented in the inertial frame in terms\nof Minkowski particles by process (i), will be represented\nin the uniformly accelerated frame as the combination of\nthe processes (ii), (iii) and (iv) in terms of Rindler particles [see above Eq. (3.69)]. These processes are characterized by the conversion of protons to neutrons due to\nthe absorption of e\u2212 and/or \u03bd\u0304 and emission of \u03bd, e+ or\nno particle, from and to the Unruh thermal bath.

The precise analytic\nequivalence was derived soon afterward by Suzuki and Yamada\n(2003).\n\n\f33\nfor high accelerations processes (ii) and (iii) dominate\nover process (iv). This is a interesting example of how\ninertial and Rindler observers may differ in the a phenomenon description, although they must agree on the\noutput of the experiments associated with scalar observables.\n\nC. Bremsstrahlung\n\nIn our next example we use the Unruh effect to discuss how the bremsstrahlung from a uniformly accelerated charge is described in the Rindler frame, addressing\nalso the celebrated question whether or not uniformly\naccelerated electric charges radiate with respect to coaccelerated observers.36 It will turn out that the Rindler\nphotons with \"zero energy\", which are characterized by\ntheir transverse momenta, play a central role. Our discussion closely follows Higuchi et al. (1992a,b) and does\nnot assume that the reader is familiar with quantization\nof the electromagnetic field.\nA point charge uniformly accelerated along the z-axis\nin the Cartesian coordinate system can be represented in\nthe Rindler coordinates (2.36) by \u03be = x = y = 0. The\ncorresponding conserved current (\u2207\u03bc j \u03bc = 0) is, then,\ngiven by\nj \u03c4 = q\u03b4(\u03be)\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y), j \u03be = j x = j y = 0.\n\n(3.109)\n\nLet us analyze the emission of photons with fixed transverse momentum k\u22a5 = (kx , ky ). The fact that k\u22a5 is\ninvariant under boosts in the z-direction allows us to directly compare the emission and absorption rates corresponding to Minkowski and Rindler photons with the\nsame transverse momentum.\nWe shall quantize the electromagnetic field defined by\nthe Lagrangian density\n\u221a\nL = \u2212 \u2212g[(1/4)F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + (2\u03b1)\u22121 (\u2207\u03bc A\u03bc )2 ]\n\n(3.110)\n\nwith the corresponding field equations in the Feynman\ngauge (\u03b1 = 1) being\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2207 F\u03bc\u03bd + \u2207\u03bd (\u2207 A\u03bc ) = \u2207\u03bc \u2207 A\u03bd = 0,\n\n(3.111)\n\nand calculate the response rate of the charge with respect\nto both inertial and Rindler observers.\n\n36\n\nFor a series of recent papers which include a critical historical\ndescription on hyperbolically moving charges in the context of\nclassical electrodynamics see Eriksen and Gr\u00f8n (2000a,b,c, 2002,\n2004).\n\n1. Inertial observer perspective\n\nAccording to inertial observers, we write the quantized\nelectromagnetic field \u00c2\u03bc (x) as\nZ\n\n3\ni\nd3 k X h (\u03bb)\n(\u03bb)\n\u2212ik\u03bd x\u03bd\na\n(k)\u01eb\n(k)e\n+\nH.c.\n\u03bc\n2(2\u03c0)3 k0\n\u03bb=0\n(3.112)\np\n2 , where \u03bb labels the mode pokz2 + k\u22a5\nwith k0 \u2261\nlarization. We shall adopt here the notation used in\nItzykson and Zuber (1980).\nWe assign \u03bb the value 0 for what we call the nonphysical modes, 1 or 2 for the physical modes and 3 for\nthe pure-gauge modes. The pure-gauge modes are those\n(3,k)\nwhich can be written as A\u03bc\n= \u2207\u03bc \u03a6 for some scalar\nfield \u03a6(x) and satisfies the Lorenz condition\n\n\u00c2\u03bc (x) =\n\n\u2207\u03bc A\u03bc = 0.\n\n(3.113)\n\nThe physical modes satisfy the Lorenz condition and are\nnot pure gauge. Finally the non-physical modes do not\nsatisfy the Lorenz condition. Accordingly, we choose the\n(\u03bb)\npolarization vectors \u01eb\u03bc as\n\u221a\n\u01eb(0)\u03bc = (\u22121, 0, 0, 1)/ 2,\n(3.114)\n(1)\u03bc\n\u01eb\n= (0, 1, 0, 0),\n(3.115)\n\u01eb(2)\u03bc = (0, 0, 1, 0),\n(3.116)\n\u221a\n\u01eb(3)\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 1)/ 2,\n(3.117)\nin the Cartesian frame chosen such that k \u03bc =\n(|k|, 0, 0, |k|) (where the first component is the time component).\nThe amplitude of emission of a photon with momentum\nk and polarization \u03bb by the accelerated charge in the\nMinkowski vacuum is\nZ\n(\u03bb,k)\nA\n= hk, \u03bb M |i d4 xj \u03bc (x)\u00c2\u03bc (x)|0M i\nZ\ni(\u03c9t\u2212k*x)\n= i d4 xj \u03bc (x)\u01eb(\u03bb)\n.

Then, we find\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nin tot\nRk\u22a5 = \u2212q 2\ndk\u0303z\u2032\nd\u03c3 cosh a\u03c3\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0015\n\u0014\na\u03c3\n2ik0\u2032\n,\n(3.124)\nsinh\n\u00d7 exp\na\n2\nwhere dk\u0303z\u2032 \u2261 dkz\u2032 /[(2\u03c0)3 2k0\u2032 ] and \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 .

A similar discussion as the one commented on in Sec. III.A.5\nconcerning whether or not uniformly accelerated electric charges radiate can be traced back up to about\nhalf a century ago [see Fulton and Rohrlich (1960) and\nreferences therein]. We recall that the radiation reaction force on a uniformly accelerated electric charge vanishes. The classical radiation reaction force is known\nto have some unusual features (Barut, 1980) but it was\nrecently shown to be in agreement with quantum field\ntheory (Higuchi, 2002; Higuchi and Martin, 2004, 2005;\nKrivitskii and Tsytovich, 1991). Clearly, no problems\narise when one deals with physical situations where electric charges are accelerated for a finite time interval\n(Jackson, 1999). Accordingly, Eq. (3.126) should be\nseen as approximating the one obtained when an electric charge is uniformly accelerated for long enough.\n\n2. Rindler observer perspective\n\nNow, we shall evaluate the response rate associated\nwith the current (3.109) according to Rindler observers\nby considering the Unruh thermal bath. The response\nwill consist of emission and absorption of photons to and\nfrom the Unruh thermal bath. It is clear that the rate of\nspontaneous emission is zero because the current (3.109)\nis static. However, it does not imply that the rates of induced emission and absorption vanish as well. This is because these rates are proportional to the number of photons present in the thermal bath which couple to the current (3.109). Since the number of zero-energy (Rindler)\nphotons in the (Unruh) thermal bath, which are the relevant ones in this case, is infinite, the rates of induced\nemission and absorption are indefinite. Hence one needs\nto regularize the current (3.109) to make both its strength\nof coupling to the field and the relevant photon number\nfinite. (The regulator is removed in the end.)\nLet us discuss our regularization procedure in two\nsteps. First we modify Eq. (3.109) by considering a\ncharge oscillating with frequency E\n\u221a\n2q cos E\u03c4 \u03b4(\u03be)\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y), j \u03be = j x = j y = 0,\n(3.127)\nand take the limit E\n\u2192\n0\nin\nthe\nend\n(Kolbenstvedt,\n\u221a\n1988). The factor 2 appears because the radiation\nrate, in first order of perturbation, is proportional to\nthe square of the charge. When the oscillation is slow,\ni.e. when E \u226a a, k\u22a5 , the charge is expected to interact\nwith the field as if it were a constant charge at each \u03c4 .\n(We assume continuity of the rate in the limit E \u2192 0.)\nHence, the \u03c4 -average of the square of the\u221a\ncharge must be\nset equal to q 2 and, therefore, the factor 2 is necessary.\nNow, the current (3.127) does not satisfy electromagnetic charge conservation. For this reason we replace\nthis current by an oscillating dipole arrangement with a\ncharge at \u03be = 0 and the other one at infinity (which is\nj\u03c4 =\n\n\f35\nomitted here because it does not affect the final result)\ndescribed by\n\u221a\n(3.128)\nj \u03c4 = 2q cos(E\u03c4 )\u03b4(\u03be)\u03b4 2 (x\u22a5 ),\n\u221a\n\u03be\n\u22122a\u03be\n2\nj = 2qE sin(E\u03c4 )e\n\u03b8(\u03be)\u03b4 (x\u22a5 ), (3.129)\nx\ny\nj = j = 0.\n(3.130)\nThe current j \u03be flowing to \u03be = \u221e will not contribute to\nthe final results. Its only importance is to keep the condition \u2207\u03bc j\u03bc = 0 valid and make the computation gauge\nindependent even before taking the limit E \u2192 0.\nNext, we analyze the interaction of the source (3.128)\u2013\n(3.130) with the Maxwell field in the Rindler wedge. For\nthis purpose we need to expand the electromagnetic field\nby the positive- and negative-frequency modes defined\nwith respect to the Rindler time \u03c4 . We again deal with\nthe Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field in\nthe Feynman gauge given by Eq. (3.110) with \u03b1 = 1,\nand the field equations in the Feynman gauge given by\nEq. (3.111) considered now in the Rindler wedge. The\npresence of \u2202\u03c4 , \u2202x and \u2202y as Killing fields makes it sufficient to look for solutions of Eq. (3.111) of the form\n\u22a5)\nA(\u03bb,\u03c9,k\n(x) = f\u03bc(\u03bb,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) (\u03be)ei(k\u22a5 *x\u22a5 \u2212\u03c9\u03c4 ) .\n\u03bc\n\n(3.131)\n\nThen, we expand the electromagnetic quantum field in\nterms of annihilation and creation operators as\nZ\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u00c2\u03bc (x) =\nd k\u22a5\nd\u03c9\n0\n\n3 n\no\nX\n\u22a5)\n\u00d7\n\u00e2(\u03bb,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) A(\u03bb,\u03c9,k\n(x) + H.c. ,\n\u03bc\n\u03bb=0\n\n(3.132)\n\n(\u03bb,\u03c9,k )\n\n\u22a5\nwhere A\u03bc\n(x) are solutions of the form given in\nEq. (3.131). These modes are conveniently expressed in\nterms of the solutions of the scalar field equation \u0003\u03c6 = 0\n[see Candelas and Deutsch (1977)]. For each set of quantum numbers the solution, which does not diverge as\n\u03be \u2192 +\u221e, is obtained by letting m = 0 in Eq. (2.92):\n\n\u03c6(\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) =\n\n\u0014\n\nsinh(\u03c0\u03c9/a)\n4\u03c0 4 a\n\n\u00151/2\n\nKi\u03c9/a [(k\u22a5 /a)ea\u03be ]\n\n\u00d7eik\u22a5 *x\u22a5 \u2212i\u03c9\u03c4 .\n\n(3.133)\n\nOne can choose a set of independent normal modes as\n\n(0,\u03c9,k )\n\n\u22a5\n6= 0. It can\nthe non-physical modes because \u2207\u03bc A\u03bc\n(\u03bb,\u03c9,k\u22a5 )\nwith \u03bb = 1, 2\nreadily be shown that the modes A\u03bc\n(\u03bb,\u03c9,k\u22a5 )\n= 0. Thus,\nsatisfy the Lorenz condition \u2207\u03bc A\u03bc\n(3,\u03c9,k\u22a5 )\n\u221d\nthese are the physical modes. The modes A\u03bc\n\u2207\u03bc \u03c6(\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) are the pure-gauge modes.\nThe normalization constants C (i) can be determined\nfrom the canonical commutation relations of the fields\nby requiring suitable commutation relations for the operators a(i) and a\u2020(i) . [Here the label (i) represents\n(\u03bb, \u03c9, k\u22a5 ).] In this context, it is convenient to introduce\nthe generalized Klein-Gordon inner product\nZ\n(i)\n(j)\nd\u03a3\u03bc W \u03bc [A(i) , A(j) ]\n(3.138)\n(A , A )KG \u2261\n\n\u03a3\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\nbetween any two modes A\u03bc and A\u03bc , where the integration is performed on some Cauchy surface \u03a3 for the\nRindler wedge, e.g., any hypersurface \u03c4 = const, and\nwhere\ni\n(i)\u03bc\u03bd\u2217\n\u03c0 (j)\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 A(j)\n)\nW \u03bc [A(i) , A(j) ] \u2261 \u221a (A(i)\u2217\n\u03bd \u03c0\n\u2212g \u03bd\n(3.139)\nwith \u03c0 (i)\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202L/\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd |A\u03bc =A(i)\u03bc . The \u03c0 (i)\u03bc\u03bd are calculated in the Feynman gauge to be\n\u221a\n\u03c0 (i)\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212g[\u2207\u03bd A(i)\u03bc \u2212\u2207\u03bc A(i)\u03bd \u2212g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03b1 A(i)\u03b1 ]. (3.140)\nIt can be seen [see, e.g., Friedman (1978)] that the field\nequations ensure conservation of the current (3.139), and\nthus the inner product (3.138) is independent of the\nchoice of the Cauchy surface \u03a3.\nFrom the canonical commutation relations one finds\n[(A(i) , \u00c2)KG , (\u00c2, A(j) )KG ] = (A(i) , A(j) )KG .\n\n(3.141)\n\n[See Eq.

The schematic summation over l represents integrations over \u03c9 and k\u22a5 as well as the summation over \u03bb.\nNext, define the matrix M (i)(j) \u2261 (A(i) , A(j) )KG . Then,\nEq. (3.142) implies [see. e.g., Higuchi (1989)]\n[\u00e2(i) , \u00e2\u2020(j) ] = (M \u22121 )(i)(j) ,\n\n(3.143)\n\nwhere (M \u22121 )(i)(j) is defined by\n\n\u22a5)\nA(0,\u03c9,k\n= C (0,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) (0, 0, kx \u03c6, ky \u03c6),\n\u03bc\n\n(3.134)\n\n\u22a5)\nA(1,\u03c9,k\n= C (1,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) (0, 0, ky \u03c6, \u2212kx \u03c6),\n\u03bc\n\n(3.135)\n\n(M \u22121 )(i)(l) M (l)(j) = \u03b4 \u03bb\u03bb \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )\u03b4 2 (k\u22a5 \u2212 k\u2032\u22a5 ) (3.144)\n\n(3.136)\n\nwith (i) = (\u03bb, \u03c9, k\u22a5 ) and (j) = (\u03bb\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 , k\u2032\u22a5 ).\nNow, by using the inner product (3.138) for the normal modes (3.134)\u2013(3.137), we can verify the following\northogonality properties:\n\n\u22a5)\nA(2,\u03c9,k\n= C (2,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) (\u2202\u03be \u03c6, \u2212i\u03c9\u03c6, 0, 0),\n\u03bc\n\n\u22a5)\nA(3,\u03c9,k\n= C (3,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) (\u2212i\u03c9\u03c6, \u2202\u03be \u03c6, ikx \u03c6, iky \u03c6),\n\u03bc\n(3.137)\n\nwhere A\u03bc = (A\u03c4 , A\u03be , Ax , Ay ), C (\u03bb,\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) are normaliza(0,\u03c9,k\u22a5 )\ntion constants, and \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(\u03c9,k\u22a5 ) .

In the\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nabsence of the thermal bath, the emission and absorption\nrates would vanish.\nNext, we recall that since there is no interference between the processes of emission and absorption of Rindler\nphotons at the tree level, the total response rate will be\ngiven by adding Eqs.

From our discussion in Sec. III.A.3 it should be clear that zero-energy\nRindler photons are not detectable since they concentrate on the horizon. As a consequence, Rindler observers do not find emission of classical radiation from\nuniformly accelerated charges although inertial observers\ndo.38 This is in agreement with conclusions obtained\nin the context of classical electromagnetism (Boulware,\n1980; Eriksen and Gr\u00f8n, 2004).\nA related question raised in this context is whether\nor not static charges in gravitational fields should radiate. The quantization of the electromagnetic field outside\nblack holes can be found in Cognola and Lecca (1998)\n\n37\n\n38\n\nThe analogous situation where the electric charge coupled to\nthe Maxwell field is replaced by a scalar source coupled to a\nmassless Klein-Gordon field has also been investigated in free\nspace (D\u0131\u0301az and Stephany, 2002; Ren and Weinberg, 1994) and\nin the presence of boundaries (Alves and Crispino, 2004). An\nequality analogous to Eq. (3.163) is satisfied in these cases as\nwell.\nA discussion on how one can account for the change in the energymomentum content of the radiation field in spite of the fact that\nuniformly accelerated charges are in equilibrium with the undetectable zero-energy Rindler photons of the Unruh thermal bath\ncan be found in Pe\u00f1a et al. (2005).\n\nand Crispino et al. (2001). This was used to analyze the\nresponse of static charges coupled to the Hawking radiation (Crispino et al., 1998). Because these charges lie at\nrest with respect to the observers following the integral\ncurve of the Killing vector generating the global timelike\nisometry with respect to whom the particle content of\nthe field theory is extracted, the response is solely associated with the emission and absorption of zero-energy\nBoulware photons (Boulware, 1975a,b). As a result, no\nclassical radiation is emitted by the static charges as seen\nby the static observer(Eriksen and Gr\u00f8n, 2004).39\n\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL PROPOSALS\n\nThis section will be mainly concerned with reviewing\ntwo complementary aspects, namely, \"proposed experimental tests of the Unruh effect\" and \"the possible contributions of the Unruh effect for the explanation of experimental data\". [For an extensive reference list of experiments related to the Unruh and Hawking effects see\nRosu (2001).] We have already stressed that the Unruh effect does not need experimental confirmation any\nmore than free Quantum Field Theory does. This fact\ndoes not invalidate, however, explanations of laboratory\nphenomena from the point of view of Rindler observers\nin terms of the Unruh effect. On the contrary, such explanations are interesting, and looking at some problems\nfrom the point of view of Rindler observers also can bring\nnew insights. This is how we shall understand here the\nexperimental proposals of \"testing\" the Unruh effect.\n\nA. Electrons in particle accelerators\n\nAmong the first attempts to explain experimental\ndata in terms of the Unruh effect is the one due\nto Bell and Leinaas (1983). The fact that the transverse polarization of electrons and positrons in particle storage rings is not perfect has been observed\nfor some time. The \"transverse polarization\" here\nmeans the polarization perpendicular to both space velocity and acceleration, i.e. along the direction of the\nmagnetic field responsible for the bending. Positrons\nand electrons are polarized in the directions paral-\n\n39\n\nA surprising coincidence appears as one considers the response\nof static scalar sources interacting with a massless Klein-Gordon\nfield outside a Schwarzschild black hole with the Unruh vacuum.\nSuch a source behaves as if it were moving with the same proper\nacceleration in the inertial vacuum of Minkowski spacetime\n(Higuchi et al., 1997). This equivalence was expected when the\nsource is close to the horizon (Grishchuk et al., 1987) but not\neverywhere. Indeed, by considering other vacua (Higuchi et al.,\n1998) as in Hartle and Hawking (1976), other spacetimes\n(Casti\u00f1eiras and Matsas, 2000),\nfields (Casti\u00f1eiras et al.,\n2003; Crispino et al., 1998) or spacetime dimensionalities\n(Crispino et al., 2004) the equivalence is broken.\n\n\f38\nlel and antiparallel to the magnetic field, respectively.\nSokolov and Ternov (1963) studied the electron-positron\npolarization in storage rings first assuming a homogeneous magnetic field. Next, Baier and Katkov (1967)\ngeneralized this result to inhomogeneous magnetic fields.\nA more comprehensive analysis was performed further\nby Derbenev and Kondratenko (1973). The polarization\nis built up gradually in time according to the formula\nP (t) = P0 (1 \u2212 e\u2212t/tbuild up ), where the maximum \u221a\npolarization achieved in ideal conditions is P0 = 8/(5 3) \u2248\n92.38% and the characteristic build-up time in the laboratory frame is\n8 m 2 \u03c13\ntbuild up = \u221a 2e 5 .\n5 3 e \u03b3\nHere me and e are the electron mass and charge, respectively,\n\u221a \u03c1 is the curvature radius of the orbit and\n\u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 v 2 is the usual relativistic factor. For circular orbits \u03c1 coincides with the circle radius; otherwise\n\u001eI\nI\n\u22123\n\u22123\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(s) ds\nds,\nwhere \u03c1(s) is the radius of curvature at each point on the\norbit and s is the spatial distance of the corresponding\npoint from some arbitrary origin defined on the orbit.\nThe photon power radiated due to the spin flip, Ispin flip ,\ncan be compared with the one due to synchrotron radiation, Isynchrotron , by\n\u221a !2\n\u0012 2 \u00132\nIspin flip\n\u03b3\n35 3\n1\u00b1\n,\n=3\nIsynchrotron\nme \u03c1\n64\nwhere the positive and negative signs should be used\nwhen initially the spin state is excited and deexcited, respectively [see Jackson (1976) and Montague (1984) for\ncomprehensive reviews on the spin-flip synchrotron radiation and the polarization of electrons in storage rings].\nAlthough theoretical investigations adapted to inertial observers were already performed, Bell and Leinaas\nposed the question whether or not it would be possible to use the spin as a sensitive thermometer and interpret the depolarization of accelerated electrons from\nthe point of view of comoving observers through the Unruh effect. The coupling between the electron spin and\na background magnetic field induces an energy gap \u2206E\nbetween the \"spin up\" and \"spin down\" states, making\nit a two-level system. If the distribution of spin-up and\nspin-down states of the accelerated electrons satisfied the\ndetailed balance relation, one could easily interpret the\nobserved depolarization in terms of the Unruh effect (see\nSec. III.A). If this was the case, the polarization\n(4.1)\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u2206E\n,\n1 + e\u2212\u03b2\u2206E\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u0393\u00b1 = \u2213\n\n8\u03bc2 \u2206E(\u2206E 2 + a2 )\n,\n3 1 \u2212 exp(\u00b12\u03c0\u2206E/a)\n\nwhere it is assumed for these machines that the magnetic\nfield points to the acceleration direction, \u03bc = ge/(4me )\nis the magnetic moment and g \u2248 2.0023 is the electron\ngyromagnetic factor. As a result, in this case the electron polarization (4.1) would indeed lead to Eq. (4.2) if\nthe actual machine specifications did not impose technical impediments. At the Stanford linac with an accelerating field of 10 MV/m, for example, the Unruh temperature associated with the corresponding proper accel2\neration of 2 \u00d7 1016 g\u2295 (g\u2295 \u2248 9.8 m/s ) would be about\n\u22121\n\u22123\n\u03b2\n= 0.7 \u00d7 10 K. The fact that this temperature\nis much smaller than the ordinary background temperature of about 300 K does not cause a substantial problem since the influence of the background thermal bath\nis damped for relativistic electrons (Costa and Matsas,\n1995; Guimar\u00e3es et al., 1998). This is so because the\nbackground photons are Doppler shifted in the electron\nproper frame and so most of them are pushed away from\nthe absorbable band. The main problem here is related\nwith the \"thermalization\" time. For instance, the polarization build-up time at the Stanford linac is much\nlarger than the flight time (actually much larger than\nthe lifetime of the Universe). As a result, no equilibrium\npolarization would be built up in linear accelerators.\nIn order to decrease the polarization build-up time,\nlarger accelerations are necessary. Large enough accelerations are indeed achieved in storage rings (Barber,\n1999). For instance, at the LEP/CERN, HERA/DESY\nand SPEAR/Stanford conditions, polarization equilibrium states could be achieved in a couple of hours, half\nan hour and 10 minutes, respectively.40 However, some\ncautionary remarks are in order. Firstly, the Thomas\nprecession plays a major role when electrons are in circular motion, in contrast to the case of linear acceleration, and cannot be disregarded. Secondly, if the\nelectrons are not linearly (and uniformly) accelerated,\nthe results concerning the Unruh effect are not guaranteed to be applicable to them. Thus, there is no\ncompelling reason to expect that the detailed balance\nrelation (3.40) and consequently Eq. (4.2) should hold\nhere. The intrinsic difficulties in the attempt to derive a\nvariant of the Unruh effect for circularly moving detectors was already discussed in Sec. III.A.7.

(1991), respectively.\n\n\f39\nNow, at first sight it would not be unnatural to expect that ultra-relativistic electrons in storage rings had\na polarization approximated by\n\n0.3\n1/(2\u221a3)\n0.25\n-1\n\n\u03b2 /a\n\n\u03b2-1/a\n\n0.2\n0.15\n\nP1 =\n\n1/(2\u03c0)\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u2206E/a\n\nFIG. 10 The frequency-dependent temperature \u03b2 \u22121 /a [see\nEq.

One should interpret \u03b2 \u22121 in\nEq. (4.3) as an effective temperature experienced by the\ndetector in circular motion.43\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\nActually, Takagi (1984) found that the response of a UnruhDeWitt detector with uniform circular motion and speed v is\nbetter approximated by the one of an Unruh-DeWitt detector\nwith a combined motion made of linear acceleration and uniform\ntranslation with speed v in the direction perpendicular to the\nacceleration.\nWe recall that Eq. (3.57) was calculated assuming ultrarelativistic detectors and, thus, Eq. (4.3) should be seen\nas an approximation.\nSee Letaw and Pfatsch (1982) and\nObadia and Milgrom (2007) for more details.\nThis temperature is \"effective\" because, due to the dependence\nof \u03b2 \u22121 on \u2206E, it cannot be considered as the temperature of a\nlegitimate thermal bath in contrast to that for the Unruh thermal\nbath.\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0g\n,\n1 + e\u2212\u03c0g\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere we have used Eq.

Here B\u20320 is the magnetic field in the inertial frame\ninstantaneously at rest with the electron. In this case a\ndescription of the depolarization in terms of Rindler observers could be discussed along the same lines as the excitation of accelerated detectors (see Sec. III.A). Clearly,\nthis would be an \"indirect\" connection with the Unruh effect, since no real thermal bath of Rindler particles could\nbe associated with observers comoving with the rotating\nelectrons.\nOn the other hand, detailed inertial frame calculations\n(Derbenev and Kondratenko, 1973; Jackson, 1976) show\nthat the polarization is actually given by\nP2 = F2 (g\u0303)/[F1 (g\u0303)e\u2212\n\n\u221a\n12|g\u0303|\n\n+ (g\u0303/|g\u0303|)F2 (g\u0303)],\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere g\u0303 = (g \u2212 2)/2,\n\n41g\u0303 23g\u0303 2\n8g\u0303 3 14g\u0303 4\nF1 (g\u0303) = 1 +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n45\n18\n15\n15 \u0013\n\u0012\n11g\u0303 17g\u0303 2 13g\u0303 3\n8g\u0303\n1+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ g\u0303 4 , (4.6)\n\u2212 \u221a\n12\n12\n24\n5 3|g\u0303|\n\nand\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n14g\u0303\n23g\u0303 3 10g\u0303 4\n2g\u0303 5\n2\n1+\n.\n+ 8g\u0303 +\n+\n+\n3\n3\n3\n3\n(4.7)\nThe fact that the polarizations (4.5) and (4.4) show substantial differences (see Fig. 11) [although some similarities can be also pointed out (Bell and Leinaas, 1983)] was\ndiscussed by Unruh (1998, 1999). The difficulty to understand the polarization in terms of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations as experienced by the circularly moving\nobservers stems from the fact that in this case the electron should be seen as a system composed of two field\ndetectors coupled to each other. In addition to the spin,\nthe vertical fluctuations in the orbit should be considered\n(Bell and Leinaas, 1987; Leinaas, 1999, 2002).44 By analyzing the problem in the Fermi-Walker frame associated\nwith the electron, it is concluded that the vertical oscillation responds in a thermal-like fashion with a frequencydependent temperature similar (but not identical) to that\nassociated with the spin alone. Nevertheless, the subtle\ncoupling between the two systems makes the joint system to have a polarization (4.5) distinct from the simple\nthermal-like one (4.4).\n8\nF2 (g\u0303) = \u221a\n5 3\n\n44\n\nSee also Barber and Mane (1988) for a comparison\nof the procedures used by Bell and Leinaas (1987) and\nDerbenev and Kondratenko (1973).\n\n\f40\nlow power loss) \"single mode\" microwave cavity.

Electrons in Penning traps\n\nThe use of the degree of freedom associated with vertical fluctuations of a single electron in circular motion as\na detector was investigated further by Rogers (1988). In\nthis paper an experimental proposal is made in which\nan electron is bound radially by the laboratory magnetic field B0 and axially by superimposing an electrostatic restoring force given by a quadrupole potential\n(Brown and Gabrielse, 1986) V = V0 (z 2 \u2212 \u03c12 /2)/(2d2 ),\nwhere V0 , d = const, and z and \u03c1 are the axial and radial\ncoordinates, respectively. Thus, the electron is in a Penning trap. As a result, an electron constrained to move in\na circular cyclotron orbit around the trap axis with angular frequency \u03c90 =p\ne|B0 |/(\u03b3me ) can oscillate axially\nwith frequency \u03c9z = eV0 /(\u03b3me d2 ). The excitation of\nthis degree of freedom could be interpreted as due to the\nvacuum fluctuation experienced by the circularly moving electron. By surrounding the Penning trap with an\nelectromagnetic cavity tuned to resonate at the electron\naxial oscillation frequency \u03c9z , the energy of the axial motion would be transferred to the cavity electromagnetic\nfield where it would be measured. In general, electrons\nare captured by the trap in large orbits but their radii\nshrink rapidly due to the emission of synchrotron radiation. In order to replace the energy lost, Rogers (1988)\nsuggests to irradiate the system with circularly polarized\nwaves of frequency \u03c90 . In the proposed experiment, an\nelectron is assumed to have velocity v = 0.6 in a background magnetic field of |B| = 1.5 \u00d7 105 G. The axial\nand angular frequencies would be \u03c9z \u2248 5 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121 and\n\u03c90 \u2248 2 \u00d7 1012 s\u22121 , respectively, corresponding to a proper\nacceleration a = \u03b3 2 v\u03c90 \u2248 6 \u00d7 1019 g\u2295 with a/2\u03c0 \u2248 2 K.\nC. Atoms in microwave cavities\n\nScully et al. (2003) and Belyanin et al. (2006) have\nconsidered a gedanken experiment assuming that a beam\nof two-level atoms are accelerated through a high-Q (i.e.\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhich is extremely small. The atoms are assumed to\nfollow the world line\nt(\u03c4 ) = t0 + \u03b1\u22121 sinh(\u03b1\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 ) = \u03b1\u22121 (cosh(\u03b1\u03c4 ) \u2212 1),\nwhere t0 = t(\u03c4 )|\u03c4 =0 is the moment in the laboratory\ntime when the atoms begin to accelerate. They enter the\ncavity at \u03c4 = \u03c4i and exit it later at \u03c4 = \u03c4e after staying\nin interaction for long enough, typically \u03b1(\u03c4e \u2212 \u03c4i ) \u226b 1.\nIn spite of the minute value predicted by the Unruh\neffect for the situation described above, in a real experiment the ratio excR/deexcR can be much larger because\nthe sharp boundaries of the cavity induce a nonadiabatic\ncoupling of the form g(\u03c4 ) = \u03bcE \u2032 between the atom and\nthe electromagnetic field, where \u03bc is the atomic dipole\nmoment and E \u2032 is the electric field as measured in the inertial frame instantaneously at rest with the atom. This\nmay be seen as a sort of laboratory implementation of\nthe finite-time detectors discussed in Sec. III.A.6, where\nthe scalar field is replaced by an electromagnetic one. For\nthe case where the photon frequency \u03bd associated with\nthe single-mode cavity satisfies \u03bd \u226b \u2206E \u226b \u03b1, the ratio\nof the excitation to deexcitation rates is found to be\nexc\n\nR/deexcR = \u03b1/(2\u03c0\u2206E),\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhich leads to a value enhanced by many orders of magnitude under the conditions given above: excR/deexcR \u223c\n10\u22123 . We note that even when the atom enters the cavity with constant velocity, the sudden turning-on of the\ninteraction induced by the sharp boundaries makes the\natom excitation rate to be nonzero. (Note that a photon\nis emitted in this excitation process.) Nevertheless, acceleration still plays a role in the ratio excR/deexcR as seen\nin Eq. (4.9). The authors note that Eq. (4.8) is recovered when one considers the limit of adiabatically slow\nswitching-off of the interaction at infinitely distant cavity\nboundaries. In this case\nexc\n\nR \u221d \u03c0\u2206E[\u03b1 sinh(\u03c0\u2206E/\u03b1)]\u22121 e\u2212\u03c0\u2206E/\u03b1 ,\n\ndeexc\n\nR \u221d \u03c0\u2206E[\u03b1 sinh(\u03c0\u2206E/\u03b1)]\u22121 e\u03c0\u2206E/\u03b1 .\n\nBelyanin et al. (2006) also discuss the existence of photons and their number in the cavity as a result of the\ninteraction with the beam of atoms (see discussion in\nSec. III.A.6). Clearly, the physical origin of the simultaneous increase of the field energy and the internal energy\nof the atom is the work done by the external force, which\ndrives the center-of-mass motion of the atom against the\nradiation reaction force.\n\n\f41\nBoth the acceleration and boundary contributions to\nthe photon emission from the ground state atom come\nfrom the counterrotating term \u221d \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302 \u2020 in the interaction\nHamiltonian, where \u00e2\u2020 is the photon creation operator\nand where the operator \u03c3\u0302 \u2020 \u2261 |aihb| converts the ground\nstate |bi of the atom to its excited state |ai. In the singlemode cavity case, we could also define an effective temperature\n\u22121\n\u03b2eff\n= \u2206E/ ln(2\u03c0\u2206E/\u03b1)\n\n(4.10)\n\nby equating Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9). Nevertheless, the Unruh and boundary effects should not be put on the same\nfooting (Obadia, 2007). We note that Eq. (4.10) is an effective temperature depending on the details of the atom\nthrough \u2206E in contrast to the Unruh temperature which\nis associated with a legitimate thermal bath of Rindler\nparticles.\nAnother possible physical implementation of a finitetime detector was also discussed recently. Alsing et al.\n(2005) have considered trapped ions prepared in the vibrational ground state with a laser cooling procedure.\nThe internal electronic state of each ion would play the\nrole of a phonon detector through the use of an external\nlaser which would couple it to the ion vibrational motion.\nThus, this phonon detector could be turned on and off at\nwill by controlling the external laser. Another interesting\nfeature of this detector is that it would be easy to vary its\nenergy gap by tuning the frequency of the external laser.\nAlsing et al. (2005) also consider a linear ion trap to analyze particle creation in condensed matter analogues of\nexpanding universes.\nD. Backreaction radiation in ultraintense lasers and related\ntopics\n\nA different path pursued in the literature concerns\nthe use of ultraintense lasers (Chen and Tajima, 1999;\nSch\u00fctzhold et al., 2006). It is known that the electric\nfield of laser-driven waves of plasma can accelerate particles in just a few meters to energies as high as the ones\nobtained by large conventional radio-frequency accelerators [see Mourou et al. (2006) and references therein]. In\nplasma wakefield accelerators, a short pulse of laser light\n(or electrons) is responsible for a collective perturbation\nof the plasma confined in a cavity producing an electromagnetic wakefield in the laser propagation direction.\nThis wakefield can be surfed by some electrons which acquire very high accelerations. However, the direct effect\nof the laser field on the electrons can induce even larger\naccelerations (and decelerations) along every laser cycle.\nElectric field pulses not too far below the Schwinger limit\n(about 1018 V /m) are expected in future facilities. (The\nSchwinger limit is associated with the electric field above\nwhich the spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs\nbecomes favorable. This is so when the work done by the\nelectric field along the electron Compton wavelength is\nat least about the mass of the electron-positron pair.)\n\nElectrons under the influence of fields with this magnitude could reach proper accelerations as high as 1028 g\u2295 .\nHere, we shall be interested in interpreting the radiation\nemitted by such electrons in terms of the Unruh effect\nrather than in the behavior of internal degrees of freedom.\nFor the sake of simplicity, Chen and Tajima consider\nthe case where two identical counterpropagating laser\nplane waves produce a standing wave. In this case, electrons can be treated as classical charges with well-defined\ntrajectories. Let us consider linearly polarized lasers with\nangular frequency \u03c90 , wave number k0 and propagation\nin the \u00b1z directions:\nEx = E0 [cos(\u03c90 t \u2212 k0 z) + cos(\u03c90 t + k0 z)],\nBy = E0 [cos(\u03c90 t \u2212 k0 z) \u2212 cos(\u03c90 t + k0 z)],\nwhere Ex and By are the electric and magnetic fields\nin the x and y directions, respectively, as measured in\nthe laboratory frame. The equations of motion for an\nelectron under the influence of this field can be written\nas\ndpx /dt = \u2212e(Ex \u2212 vz By ),\ndpz /dt = \u2212evx By ,\nwhere px = me \u03b3vx and vx \u2261 dx/dt. The largest electric\nfield is found at the nodal points k0 z = 0, \u00b12\u03c0, . . . where\nEx = 2E0 cos(\u03c90 t) and By = 0. In particular, at z = 0,\nChen and Tajima find\nq\n\u03b3vx = 2a0 sin \u03c90 t, \u03b3 = 1 + 4a20 sin2 \u03c90 t,\n\nwhere a0 = eE0 /(me \u03c90 ) is a dimensionless parameter,\nwhich characterizes the laser strength. The corresponding electron proper acceleration is, thus, given by\na = 2a0 \u03c90 cos \u03c90 t,\nand the total Larmor radiation power dIL /dt\n(2/3)e2 a2 is\ndIL /dt = (8/3)e2 a20 \u03c902 cos2 \u03c90 t.\n\n=\n\n(4.11)\n\nHence, the total energy radiated during each laser half\ncycle is \u2206IL = (4\u03c0/3)e2 a20 \u03c90 .\nWe have shown in Sec. III.C how the radiation emitted\nby uniformly accelerated charges can be interpreted from\nthe point of view of coaccelerated observers in terms of\nthe emission and absorption of zero-energy Rindler photons to and from the Unruh thermal bath, respectively.\nIn this calculation, the charge was assumed not to recoil\nin the emission/absorption process. This assumption is\njustified if the mass of the charge is much larger than\nthe typical (Minkowski) energy of the photon emitted.\nIn a real physical set-up, however, the electron backreacts to the Larmor radiation. Chen and Tajima claim\nthat this backreaction triggers additional \"quivering radiation\", which reflects the Unruh effect. They estimate\n\n\f42\nthe power of this radiation, \u2206IU , in comparison to that\nof the Larmor radiation, \u2206IL , as\n\u2206IU\n9 ~\u03c90\n\u2248 2\na0 log(a0 /\u03c0) \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n\u2206IL\n\u03c0 m e c2\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere me is the electron mass, for \u03c90 \u2248 2 \u00d7 1015 sec\u22121\nand a0 \u2248 100.\nSch\u00fctzhold et al. (2006) note that a Rindler photon\nseen to be scattered off a static charge by the Rindler\nobservers should correspond to a pair of correlated\nMinkowski photons emitted from a uniformly accelerated charge as seen by the inertial observers. (Note\nthat a Rindler photon with nonzero energy can cause\nthis process in contrast to the Larmor radiation, i.e. the\nbremsstrahlung.) They propose this two-photon emission process as a distinct signal of the Unruh effect. they\nargue that, as long as the acceleration is not close to the\nSchwinger limit, where the Unruh temperature becomes\ncomparable to the electron mass, Rindler observers can\ndescribe the electrons as pointlike (Thomson) scatterers\nof Rindler photons. (In this regime the electron spin is\nnot supposed to play any major role.) They assert that\nthe most promising strategy to observe a signal of this\nradiation above the background Larmor noise would be\nby probing the angular distribution of the photon emission; in contrast to the Larmor radiation, which has a\nwell known blind spot along the motion direction, this\ntwo-photon radiation dominates inside small backward\nand forward cones.45 They also note that another signal\nwould be the direct detection of correlated photons.\nAlthough the residual quivering radiation or correlated\nradiation of Minkowski photons could be explained and\ncalculated by inertial observers using textbook quantum\nfield theory46 , it is certainly interesting to understand\nthese processes invoking the Unruh effect.\nFinally, let us mention here some works concerning a\ndetailed-balance relation obeyed by the transverse momentum of a uniformly accelerated electron. The differential probability of emission of a photon by an electron\nin a constant electric field E was obtained by Nikishov\n(1970) by means of an inertial frame calculation, where\nthe electron and photon fields are quantized. The recoil\ncauses the electron to change its momentum perpendicular to the background electric field, which accelerates the\nelectron. Let P (p\u22a5 \u2192 p\u2032\u22a5 ) be the differential probability\nassociated with the photon emission changing the modulus of the transverse momentum of the electron from p\u22a5\nto p\u2032\u22a5 . Nikishov and Ritus (1988) find\nP (p\u22a5 \u2192 p\u2032\u22a5 )\n= exp(\u2212\u03b2\u2206E),\nP (p\u2032\u22a5 \u2192 p\u22a5 )\n\n45\n46\n\n(4.13)\n\nChen and Tajima (1999) also propose to exploit the blind spot\nof the Larmor radiation.\nWe have favored the term \"quivering\" rather than \"Unruh\" radiation, as appears sometimes in the literature, to emphasize that\nthis does not depend on the Unruh effect any more than the\nLarmor one does.\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u22121 = a/2\u03c0 with a = eE/me and\n2\n\u2206E = p\u20322\n\u22a5 /2me \u2212 p\u22a5 /2me .\n\n(4.14)\n\nThis expression for \u2206E is valid even if p\u22a5 and p\u2032\u22a5 are\ncomparable to me . If p\u22a5 , p\u2032\u22a5 \u226a me , then\nq\nq\n2\u2212\n+\nm\n(4.15)\np2\u22a5 + m2e .\n\u2206E \u2248 p\u20322\ne\n\u22a5\np\nMyhrvold (1985) calls p2\u22a5 + m2e the transverse energy\nof the electron with transverse momentum p\u22a5 and claims\nthat the relation (4.13) reflects the Unruh effect for\np\u22a5 , p\u2032\u22a5 \u226a me . Indeed Eq. (4.13) is similar to the detailed\nbalance relation (3.40), which was derived assuming hyperbolic motion of the source.47 Although the relation\n(4.13) may well be closely related to the Unruh effect, the\nformer does not directly follow from the latter because\nthe connection between the Rindler energy [in Eq. (3.40)]\nand the transverse energy [in Eq. (4.13)] is not entirely\nclear.\nE. Thermal spectra in hadronic collisions\n\nNow, let us turn our attention to insights that the Unruh effect can bring to explain some experimental data\nin hadronic physics. The Unruh effect has been considered as possibly helpful in explaining the puzzling\nthermal-like emission spectra observed in hadron collisions (Barshay et al., 1980; Barshay and Troost, 1978;\nKharzeev, 2006). The main idea is that in the collision\nprocess, hadrons would feel in their rest frame a large Unruh temperature, which would lead them to quiver and\ninteract accordingly. It is conjectured, then, that the\nthermal-like emission of Minkowski particles observed in\nhadron processes would be a reflection of it. In some\nsense, it may be that a quivering-like radiation which\nwe have discussed in Sec. IV.D in a quite different context becomes the explanation for this puzzling aspect of\nhadron collisions. As we have said, the Unruh thermal\nbath is not required for the investigation of accelerated\nsystems from the point of view of inertial observers. For\nthese observers, \"plain\" quantum field theory must suffice for a complete phenomenon description. Nevertheless, it would be certainly interesting if the Unruh effect could bring new insights to the understanding of this\nproblem.\nF. Unruh and Moore (dynamical Casimir) effects\n\nThere have also appeared some proposals of using the\nMoore effect, often called dynamical Casimir effect, as a\n\n47\n\nRecent investigations also considering the backreaction on\naccelerated systems can be found in Parentani (1995),\nParentani and Massar (1997), Gabriel et al. (1998) and Reznik\n(1998).\n\n\f43\nway to test the thermal bath observed by Rindler observers. Here we discuss why the connection between the\nMoore and Unruh effects is tenuous and comment briefly\non some few selected proposals. We refer to Rosu (2001)\nfor a more extensive list.\nMoore (1970) and later DeWitt (1975) found independently that photons can be created by moving mirrors\nin the Minkowski vacuum. An interesting connection between the Moore effect and the Hawking radiation was\nestablished by Davies and Fulling (1977b) and more recently revisited by Calogeracos (2002a,b). These authors consider a massless scalar field in two-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime equipped with a reflective boundary. At t = 0 the boundary begins to move to the left\nfollowing the trajectory\nz(t) = \u2212\u03ba\u22121 ln(cosh \u03bat),\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere \u03ba = const and x\u03bc = (t, z) are the usual Cartesian\ncoordinates.48 We note that asymptotically the corresponding world line becomes lightlike. (Notice that the\nproper acceleration of the boundary is \u03ba cosh \u03bat 6= \u03ba.)\nEventually, the receding boundary induces a thermal flux\nof Minkowski particles to the right characterized by a\ntemperature \u03ba/2\u03c0. (This would not be so if the boundary were uniformly accelerated.) The energy content associated with the particle emission was also investigated\n(Fulling and Davies, 1976) [see also Calogeracos (2004)].\nThere is, thus, a similarity between the flux of Minkowski\nparticles, which are emitted from the receding boundary\nand the Hawking radiation of Boulware particles produced in a black hole formation process.\nNow, by approximating the line element of a black hole\nclose to its horizon by that of the Rindler wedge as discussed in Sec. III.A.3, we can establish a correspondence\nbetween static observers outside the horizon and Rindler\nobservers, where the former and latter observers are immersed in the Hawking radiation and Unruh thermal\nbath, respectively [see also Ginzburg and Frolov (1987)].\nThis leads to the following loose connection\nMoore effect ! Hawking radiation ! Unruh effect,\nwhere the Moore effect is seen as a flat spacetime analog of the Hawking effect and this is connected with the\nUnruh thermal bath close to the black hole horizon. It\nshould be stressed, however, that although the observation of the Moore effect would be very interesting, this\nwould not constitute a experimental verification of the\nUnruh effect. It is worthwhile to emphasize that the thermal flux associated with the Moore and Unruh effects are\nformed of Minkowski and Rindler particles, respectively,\nwhich are quite different. The Moore, Hawking and Unruh effects, although related, have features which make\nthem distinct.\n\n48\n\nNotice that by identifying t, z and \u03ba with \u03c4, \u03be and a, respectively,\nwe obtain Eq. (2.36) with z = a\u22121 .\n\nDespite the fact that the Moore and Unruh effects are\nonly linked through the indirect reasoning above, we comment briefly on some experimental proposals, which are\ninteresting in their own right. Yablonovitch (1989) [see\nalso Yablonovitch et al. (1989)] has recently discussed\nthe possibility of using media with varying index of refraction to observe a Moore-like effect. When a gas is\nsuddenly photo-ionized, its index of refraction drops from\nabout 1 to 0. This disturbs the vacuum in a way similar\nto what an accelerated mirror does. [For a comparative discussion between these two similar effects see, e.g.,\nJohnston and Sarkar (1995).] Likewise, sudden creation\nof electron-hole pairs in a semiconductor slab can quickly\nreduce the refractive index from about 3.5 to 0. Considering a general medium with time-varying index of refraction n = n(t) which instantaneously jumps from n0\nto n, Yablonovitch (1989) found an expectation number\nof created modes with wave vector k given by\nX\n|\u03b2kk\u2032 |2 ,\nNk =\nk\u2032\n\n\u221a\nwhere |\u03b2kk\u2032 | = |n \u2212 n0 |\u03b4kk\u2032 /(2 nn0 ). The experimental\nprospect of the laboratory verification of Moore-like effects in the near future seem very promising [see, e.g.,\n(Kim et al., 2006; Uhlmann et al., 2004)].\nV. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\nRecently, a number of issues connecting Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Information Theory have been\ninvestigated [see Peres and Terno (2004) for a critical review]. Here we comment briefly on some of these issues\nand other topics that have the Unruh effect as the central\ntheme. We refer the reader to our list of references for\nmore details.\nA. Entanglement and Rindler observers\n\nAs is well known, mixed states can be obtained from\npure states by tracing out (i.e. ignoring) some of its degrees of freedom (Zurek, 1991). However, it was not obvious until recently that the \"amount of mixing\" could depend on the observer. For a spin-1/2 system Peres et al.\n(2002) found that, in general, different inertial observers\nwill find distinct values for the corresponding von Neumann quantum entropy\nS = \u2212Tr(\u03c1red ln \u03c1red ).\nHere \u03c1red is the reduced density matrix associated with\nthe spin-1/2 particle, which is obtained after the momentum degrees of freedom are traced out. Later on, for\na pair of massive spin-1/2 particles Gingrich and Adami\n(2002) found that by tracing out the momentum degrees of freedom, different inertial observers will assign\nin general distinct entanglements between the particle\n\n\f44\nspins. A similar conclusion was reached for the entanglement between the polarization of a pair of photon beams\n(Gingrich et al., 2003).\nAlthough the entanglement between some degrees\nof freedom can be transferred to others as shown\nabove, all inertial observers will agree about the entanglement of the full state. This is not the case,\nhowever, when non-inertial observers are involved.\nFuentes-Schuller and Mann (2005) investigated the entanglement between two modes of a free massless scalar\nfield as seen by inertial and uniformly accelerated observers. They reached the conclusion that the existence\nof a horizon for the Rindler observer leads in general to\nloss of information. The entanglement which appears to\nbe maximal for inertial observers is degraded according\nto the Rindler ones because of the Unruh effect. The authors suggest that analogous conclusions should be valid\nclose to black holes when inertial and Rindler observers\nare replaced by free-falling and static ones, respectively.\nA thorough investigation of such questions in general\ncurved spacetimes would be very interesting.\n\nB. Decoherence of accelerated detectors\n\nDiscussions on the decoherence of accelerated detectors have been continuing since some years ago\n(Audretsch et al., 1995). Kok and Yurtsever (2003) considered a qubit |\u03c8i represented by a (uniformly accelerated) Unruh-DeWitt detector with free Hamiltonian\nH0 = \u2206E b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302, where \u2206E is the energy gap between\nthe two internal degrees of freedom |0i and |1i of the\nqubit, and b\u0302 and b\u0302\u2020 denote the lowering and raising operators, respectively, acting on the corresponding twodimensional Hilbert space:\nb\u0302|0i = 0, b\u0302\u2020 |0i = |1i, b\u0302|1i = |0i, b\u0302\u2020 |1i = 0.\nThe qubit is coupled to a real scalar field \u03a6\u0302(x, t) through\nthe interaction Hamiltonian\nZ\n\u221a\nHI (t) = \u01eb(t)\n\u03a6\u0302(x, t)(\u03c8(x)b\u0302 + \u03c8\u0304(x)b\u2020 ) \u2212g d3 x,\n\u03a3\n\nwhere \u03c8(x) is a smooth function which vanishes outside\na small volume around the qubit. The integration is over\nthe global spacelike Cauchy surface \u03a3 given by t = const\n(with t being the usual Cartesian time coordinate) and\n\u01eb(t) is a time dependent coupling constant, which vanishes everywhere except within a finite time interval \u2206t\nwhere \u01eb(t) = \u01eb = const. Before the acceleration takes\nplace, the qubit is prepared in the state\n\u221a\n|\u03c8i = (|0i + |1i)/ 2 ,\nwhich is combined with the field state described by the\nreduced density matrix (2.78). We recall that this is obtained when the degrees of freedom of the Minkowski\n\nvacuum associated with one of the Rindler wedges are\ntraced out. Then, the combined initial state\n\u03c1\u0302in = \u03c1\u0302R \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\n\n(5.1)\n\nmust be evolved through the interaction Hamiltonian\nleading to \u03c1\u0302out . Kok and Yurtsever find the final reduced\ndensity matrix associated with the qubit by tracing out\nthe field degrees of freedom as\n\u03c1\u0302q,out = Tr\u03a6 (\u03c1\u0302out )\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 S0 + Se\nS0\n=\n,\nS0\nS0 + Sa\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere\nS0 = (1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c0\u2206E/a )\n\nX\nn\n\nSa = (1 \u2212 e\n\n\u22122\u03c0\u2206E/a\n\n)|\u03bc|2\n\nSe = (1 \u2212 e\n\n\u22122\u03c0\u2206E/a\n\n2\n\ne\u22122\u03c0n\u2206E/a /Qn ,\nX\n\nne\u22122\u03c0n\u2206E/a /Qn ,\n\nn\n\n)\u03bd\n\nX\n\n(n + 1)e\u22122\u03c0n\u2206E/a /Qn .\n\nn\n\nHere, Qn = 1 + n|\u03bc|2 /2 + (n + 1)\u03bd 2 /2, where\n\u01eb\u2206t \u2212\u03ba2 \u2206E 2 /2\n\u01eb\u2206t\n|\u03bc| \u2248 \u221a\ne\n, \u03bd \u2248 \u221a 3 1/2\n2( \u03c0\u03ba )\n2\u2206E\n\n(5.3)\n\nand \u03ba is a length scale setting the spatial range of the\ninteraction. Then, they show that the purity Tr(\u03c1\u03022q,out )\ndecreases monotonically with the qubit proper acceleration a, as expected.\nC. Generalized second law of thermodynamics and the\n\"self-accelerating box paradox\"\n\nIn a colloquium delivered at Princeton University in\nthe early 1970's R. Geroch raised the possibility of violating the ordinary second law of thermodynamics with the\nhelp of classical black holes. The idea was to bring slowly\nfrom infinity a box with proper energy Eb over the event\nhorizon and throw it eventually inside the hole. The cycle\nwould be closed by lifting back the ideal rope characterized by an arbitrarily small mass. Because static asymptotic observers would assign zero energy to the box at\nthe event horizon, the hole would remain the same after\nengulfing it. This would challenge the ordinary second\nlaw of thermodynamics, since eventually all entropy associated with the box would vanish from the Universe\nwith no compensating entropy increase elsewhere.\nAs an objection to Geroch's process, Bekenstein argued that quantum mechanics would constrain the size\nand energy of the box accordingly. This constraint would\nmake it impossible for all parts of the box to reach the\nevent horizon at once and, thus, the black hole would\nnecessarily gain mass after engulfing the box. Then,\nBekenstein (1973) conjectured that black holes would\nhave a nonzero entropy Sbh = A/4 proportional to the\n\n\f45\nevent horizon area A and formulated the generalized second law (GSL), namely, that the total entropy of a closed\nsystem (including that associated with black holes) would\nnever decrease. This opened a new whole subject called\n\"black hole thermodynamics\".49 Now, because the GSL\nwould be violated if the entropy of the box S satisfied\nS > 2\u03c0Eb R, where R is the proper radius of the smallest\nsphere circumscribing the box, Bekenstein conjectured\nin addition the existence of a new thermodynamical law,\nnamely, that every system should have an entropy-toenergy ratio satisfying S/Eb \u2264 2\u03c0R.\nLater, however, Unruh and Wald (1982) concluded50\nthat by taking into account the buoyancy force induced\nby the Hawking radiation, the GSL would not be violated even without the imposition of the constraint\nS/Eb \u2264 2\u03c0R. The thermal ambiance outside the hole\nwould prevent the box from descending beyond the point\nafter which the energy delivered to the black hole would\nbe too small to guarantee \u03b4Sbh \u2265 S as demanded by the\nGSL [see also Matsas and da Silva (2005)]. However, by\naccepting that the box floats due to the Hawking radiation, we are led to conclude that a box in the Minkowski\nvacuum would be able to self-accelerate because of the\nUnruh thermal bath.51\nThe \"self-accelerating box paradox\" was recently revisited by Marolf and Sorkin (2002). They concluded that\nthe heat absorbed by the box walls would increase their\nmasses preventing the box from floating outside the black\nhole and, thus, self-accelerating in Minkowski spacetime.\nAlthough this would solve the self-accelerating box paradox, the GSL seemed to be in danger again. However,\nMarolf and Sorkin (2002) presented a way out to save\nthe GSL without the introduction of any extra entropybound law by assuming the existence of \"box-antibox\npairs\" in the Hawking radiation. Further discussion can\nbe found in Marolf and Sorkin (2004) and in the next\nsection.\n\nwith a Rindler horizon. They concluded that, although\ninertial observers assign an entropy equal to the logarithm of the number of internal states n to an arbitrary object, this would not be the case for Rindler observers. For bodies with a large number of internal states,\nn \u226b 1, Rindler observers would assign an entropy of\nonly SR \u2248 ER \u03b2, where ER is the Killing energy associated with the Rindler observers and \u03b2 \u22121 = \u03ba/2\u03c0 is the\ncorresponding temperature associated with the surface\ngravity \u03ba. As a result, a falling object which crosses the\nhorizon would respect the GSL according to the Rindler\nobservers no matter how many internal states (i.e. how\nlarge entropy is according to the inertial observers) it\nmight carry. The inertial observer, at the same time,\nshould raise no doubt about the GSL since he/she would\nnever lose sight of the object. This illustrates how subtle\nthe entropy concept can be in General Relativity.\n\nE. Einstein equations as an equation of state?\n\nThe four laws of black hole mechanics, which are\nclosely connected with the four laws of black hole thermodynamics were derived by assuming the Einstein equations. Jacobson (1995) has put forward the intriguing\nidea of turning the logic around and deriving the Einstein\nequations by assuming (i) the proportionality of entropy\nand the horizon area and (ii) the fundamental relation\n\u03b4Q = T dS, where \u03b4Q and T would be interpreted as the\nenergy flux and Unruh temperature, respectively, seen\nby an accelerated observer just outside the horizon. In\nthis sense, Einstein equations could be seen as an \"equation of state\" of spacetime. Because of its importance\nto Thermodynamics, Relativity, Information Theory and\nQuantum Gravity, black hole thermodynamics will undoubtedly continue attracting a lot of attention in the\nnear future, and the Unruh effect should keep being a\nuseful tool in the investigation of these issues.\n\nD. Entropy and Rindler observers\n\nEven if the GSL is not violated in the thought experiment above, one could think of more extreme situations where objects with fixed energy and volume but\ncarrying an arbitrary amount of entropy are beamed toward a black hole. In order to analyze these situations,\nMarolf et al. (2004) considered a large enough black hole\nto reduce the problem again to the corresponding one\n\n49\n\n50\n51\n\nRecently there have been some works on how the laws of thermodynamics associated with black hole horizons can be extended to\nwhat Jacobson and Parentani (2003) call causal horizons, i.e. the\nboundary of the past of any timelike curve \u03bb of infinite proper\nlength in the future direction.\nSee also Unruh and Wald (1983) in response to Bekenstein\n(1983).\nThis would be so because of the Unruh temperature gradient\nalong the box in the acceleration direction.\n\nF. Miscellaneous topics\n\nSeveral other issues connected with the Unruh effect have attracted attention recently.\nIn parallel\nto the investigation of the decoherence of the internal state of single accelerated detectors as commented in Sec. V.B, studies of the entanglement between independent accelerated detectors coupled to a\nbackground field can be found in the literature [see,\ne.g., Benatti and Floreanini (2004); Massar and Spindel\n(2006); Pringle (1989); Reznik et al. (2005)].\nRecently Alsing and Milburn (2003), Alsing et al. (2004)\nand Alsing et al. (2006) have considered the teleportation of a state between an inertial and a Rindler observer. Although the authors' conclusion that the fidelity\nof the teleportation will be in general reduced due to\nthe Unruh effect may be correct in the end, the details\nwill probably depend on the particular experimental set-\n\n\f46\nup. For instance, ideal uniformly accelerated rigid cavities prepared in the Rindler vacuum would keep thermal\nfluctuations out (Levin et al., 1992) and the Unruh effect would not be responsible, in principle, for fidelity\nloss [see Sch\u00fctzhold and Unruh (2005) for further considerations]. More detailed investigations are expected\nin the near future when the Unruh effect should begin to be studied in connection with quantum communication (Br\u00e1dler, 2007). A different sort of question\nwhich one may pose is whether or not sufficiently accelerated Rindler observers would see broken symmetries\nbeing restored because of the high temperature of the\nUnruh thermal bath (Ebert and Zhukovsky, 2007; Hill,\n1985; Kharzeev and Tuchin, 2005; Ohsaku, 2004). Finally, the Unruh effect has also gained importance in\nquantum gravity theories [see, e.g., Susskind and Uglum\n(1994)]52 and condensed matter physics (Unruh, 1981)\nbecause of its close relation with the Hawking effect.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank C.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe Unruh effect has played a crucial role in our understanding that the particle content of a field theory is\nobserver dependent. It expresses the fact that uniformly\naccelerated observers in Minkowski spacetime associate a\nthermal bath of Rindler particles to the no-particle state\nof inertial observers. As a Quantum Field Theory effect,\nit does not depend on extra structures such as particle\ndetectors or other measuring apparatus. By the same\ntoken, the Unruh effect does not require experimental\nconfirmation any more than free quantum field theory\ndoes, although some observables can be more easily computed and interpreted from the point of view of uniformly\naccelerated observers using the Unruh effect. This is a\nmatter of convenience and not of principle. We have dedicated Sec. III to discuss in detail some physical phenomena using plain quantum field theory adapted to inertial\nobservers and shown how the same observables can be\nrecalculated from the point of view of Rindler observers\nwith the help of the Unruh effect.\nThe Unruh effect is also useful as a theoretical laboratory to investigate phenomena such as the thermal\nemission of particles from black holes and cosmological horizons because it retains many essential features\nof these phenomena while reducing their technical complexity. Because of the importance of the Hawking (and\nHawking-like) effect(s) to Thermodynamics, Information\nTheory, Quantum Gravity and Cosmology, the Unruh effect should continue being a valuable tool in the future\nto those who intend to investigate these issues.\n\n52\n\nSee also, e.g., Parentani and Potting (1989), who have considered\nuniformly accelerated observers in the vacuum of free strings.\n\nBy the differential equation (2.86) satisfied by g\u03c9k\u22a5 and\nthe condition (2.87) we find\n(\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 \u20322 )SA (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 )\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd \u2217\nd\n\u2217\n= g\u03c9\u2032 k\u22a5 (\u03be) g\u03c9k\u22a5 (\u03be) \u2212 g\u03c9k\u22a5 (\u03be) g\u03c9\u2032 k\u22a5 (\u03be)\nd\u03be\nd\u03be\n\u03be=\u2212A\n1\n\u2248 {(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 ) sin [(\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2032 )A \u2212 \u03b3(\u03c9) \u2212 \u03b3(\u03c9 \u2032 )]\n\u03c0\n+(\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2032 ) sin [(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )A \u2212 \u03b3(\u03c9) + \u03b3(\u03c9 \u2032 )]}\n(A2)\nfor \u03be < 0, |\u03be| \u226b 1.
