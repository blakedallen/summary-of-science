Since the chemical potential on a stressed surface is larger inside an\nindentation, small shape fluctuations develop because material preferentially diffuses out of indentations. When the bulk of the material is purely elastic one expects this instability to run into a\nfinite-time cusp singularity. It is shown here that this singularity is cured by plastic effects in the\nmaterial, turning the singular solution to a regular crack.\n\nWe address the problem of an amorphous material with\na free surface on which the material can diffuse such that\nthe surface normal velocity is proportional to \u2202 2 \u03bc/\u2202b2\nwhere \u03bc is the local chemical potential and b is the parameterization of the interface. When the material itself is purely elastic, this phenomenon leads to an instability which was termed 'thermal grooving' by Mullins\n[1] who discovered it. The phenomenon of grooving is\nequally present in crystals, where it provides an annoying mechanism for the failure of growing crystals [2, 3],\nas it does in a range of amorphous solids that concern us\nhere. Mullins considered the linear instability taking into\naccount only the curvature dependence of the chemical\npotential. In fact, the chemical potential along the interface is strongly dependent on the elastic energy; linear\nstability analysis taking both effects into account [4] reveals that the surface is stable for short wavelengths but\nunstable for longer ones, with a usual 'fastest growing\nmode' whose wavelength depends on the material parameters. The late stage of development of this instability was initially studied by a handful of researchers,\nnamely Asaro and Tiller [5] and Grinfeld [6] and followed\nby many [4, 7, 8, 9]. The result is that the instability runs into a finite-time singularity, with the growing\nindentation forming a cusp. Clearly, this often explored\n[7, 10, 11] mathematical phenomenon cannot be physical,\nand its discovery leaves open the question of the physical\nmechanism that may cure the singularity.\nThe question of what might cure the finite-time singularity in the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld (ATG) instability\nremained dormant until recently Brener and Spatschek\nproposed that inertial effect in the velocity of the moving\nboundary may tame the singularity [8]. These authors\npointed out that without inertial effects the velocity of\nthe tip v appears in one dimensionless combintation, i.e.\nvr03 /D where r0 is the radius of the tip and D the diffusion coefficient (of dimension length4 /time, and cf. Eq.\n(15)). Therefore there is no mechanism to select v or\nr0 , and as r0 decreases without limit, v increases without imit. Once inertial effects are taken into account the\nvelocity appears also in the combination v/vR where vR\nis the Rayleigh wave speed. Thus a selection of both v\nand r0 can hapen. While clearly correct, the present authors stress that in many cases the surface diffusion is\n\nvery slow, leading to small interface velocities which do\nnot justify the incorporation of inertial terms. We focus here on such cases where the question of taming the\ncusp-singularities remains open.\nIn this Letter we propose that the generic mechanism\nfor the taming of the ATG instability may be plastic deformation in the stressed material, especially near the putative cusp. To test and demonstrate this proposition we\nwill employ the recently proposed theory of elasto-plastic\ndynamics in amorphous systems [12]. To this theory,\nwhich is valid in the bulk of the material, we couple the\nsurface diffusion, allowing the chemical potential to take\nits stress dependence from the elasto-plastic theory. For\nconcreteness we choose to explore this interesting physics\non the inner surface of a circular hole which is stressed at\ninfinity in a radial fashion. The surface diffusion modifies\nthe shape of the slightly perturbed circular hole, leading\neventually to a highly non-linear morphology. With a\nsharpening interface due to the surface diffusion instability, stresses in the bulk increase rapidly, exceeding at\nsome point in time the yield stress of the material, triggering plastic flows which are dissipated by the exertion\nof plastic work [12, 13, 14]. It is interesting to observe the\ncoupling of both processes, namely surface diffusion and\nplasticity, as they become competitive and of opposite\ninfluence on the morphology, to a point where the finite\ntime singularity is removed. In addition to shedding new\nlight on the late stage of the ATG instability we find that\nthe elasto-plastic theory employed here, which is sensitive to the plastic properties of matter, allows a natural\nunderstanding of this a-priori seemingly hard problem.\nThe model system that we consider here is an infinite\n2-dimensional isotropic elasto-plastic sheet with a hole in\nthe center whose radius is R(\u03b8). For r(\u03b8) < R(\u03b8) the system is void, whereas the elasto-plastic material occupies\nthe region r(\u03b8) \u2265 R(\u03b8) . The boundary is traction free,\nmeaning that on the boundary \u03c3ij nj = 0 where \u03c3 is the\nstress tensor and n is the unit normal vector. The equations of acceleration and continuity are exact, reading:\nDv\n= \u2207*\u03c3\n(1)\nDt\nD\u03c1\n= \u2212\u03c1\u2207 * v\n(2)\nDt\nHere the full material derivative D is defined for an arbi\u03c1\n\n\f2\ntrary tensor A as:\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the spin tensor \u03c9ij \u2261\n\nDA\n= \u2202t A + v * \u2207A + A * \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 * A,\nDt\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202vi\n\u2202xj\n\n\u0011\n\u2202v\n\u2212 \u2202xji .

A fundamental assumption of our\nelasto-plastic theory is that the total rate of deformation\nD tot \u2261 12 [\u2207v + (\u2207v)\u2020 ] can be a represented as a linear\ncombination of its elastic and plastic components [14]:\nD tot \u2261 D el + D pl\n\n(8)\n\nHere the elastic contribution, Del , is assumed to be linearly dependent on the stress (linear elasticity)\nel\nDij\n\u2261\n\nD\u01ebij\nDt\n\n\u01ebij = \u2212\n\np\u03b4ij\nsij\n+\n2K\n2\u03bc\n\n(9)\n\nwhere K and \u03bc are the 2-dimensional bulk and shear\nmoduli and p and sij are the pressure and the deviatoric\nstress tensor, respectively. The plastic rate of deformation, Dpl , is determined by a set of internal fields which\nare discussed at length in [12] where the elasto-plastic\ntheory is presented in detail. For the purpose of this Letter it is enough to state that the tensorial field m acts\nas a 'back-stress' due to plastic deformations, and the\nscalar field \u03c7 is the effective temperature that controls the\namount of configurational disorder in the elasto-plastic\nmaterials.

Without the effects of elasto-plasticity\nin the bulk the normal velocity satisfies\nvn = \u2212\n\nD s \u03a92 \u03b4 \u2202 2 \u03bc\nkB T \u2202b2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Ds , the surface diffusion constant, \u03a9, particle volume and \u03b4, the number of particles per unit area. In\nsolving the coupled problem the total normal velocity\nshould be computed as a sum of this contribution and\nthe one coming from Eqs. (4) and (5).\nThe chemical potential on the boundary, \u03bc(\u03b8), is associated on the one hand with the destabilizing curvature\nand on the other hand with the stabilizing surface energy\n[3]:\n\u03bc = \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03ba + E .\n\n(16)\n\nHere \u03bc0 is the chemical potential of the unperturbed surface, the curvature \u03ba(\u03b8) = (R2 + 2R\u20322 \u2212 RR\u2032\u2032 )/(R2 +\nR\u20322 )3/2 and the strain energy density E = 12 \u03c3ij \u01ebij [15]. \u03b3\nis the surface energy.\nIn terms of these effects on the chemical potential one\nderives the equation for the normal velocity due to surface diffusion alone:\n\u0011 \u0010 (1 \u2212 \u03bd 2 )\n\u0011i\nDs \u03a92 \u03b4 \u2202 2 \u03bc h\u0010\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b3\u03ba(\u03b8)\n+\n,\n\u03c3\n(\u03b8)\nvn = \u2212\nij\nkB T \u2202b2\n2E\n(17)\nwhere \u03bd is the Poisson ratio and E Young's Modulus.\nAfter non-dimensionalization and projecting from vn to\n\n\f3\nvr one ends up with the following equation in terms of\ndimensionless quantities (denoted with tilde):\n\nAs noted, we need to couple Eqs. (4 ),(5) and (18) to be\nsolved together, such that the surface normal velocity is\nmade from the sum of contributions coming from the bulk\ndynamics and the surface dynamics respectively. This\nshould be done while keeping the traction free boundary\nconditions and the initial condition of a pure elastic solution of a slightly perturbed circle. In practice we used\nthe fact that the elastic response is the fastest process\nin this problem. Accordingly we solved at each iteration first the elastic part of the model (with Dpl = 0) to\nfind the stress fields which is in agreement with the given\ninterface, without taking into account any plastic deformation. Second, elasto-plastic relaxation was allowed to\ntake place, until the system reached elasto-plastic equilibrium, allowing the interface to change. Here 'equilibrium' means that Dpl is smaller than 10\u22124 . Lastly, a step\nof surface diffusion was allowed to take place using an\nadaptive time step such as to bound the maximal movement of the boundary by 10\u22124 . The last step changes\nthe morphology of the boundary again, necessitating a\nre-calculation of the elastic fields around the new boundary, etc. Since the effect on the velocity of the interface in\nthe last two steps is additive, these steps (being infintesimal) could be also done simultaneously with impunity.\nWe chose to separate the last two steps since the plastic\nand surface diffusion processes are non-dimensionalized\nindependantly and have different normalization values of\ncharacteristic times and stresses.\nIn order to realize an infinite sheet it is convenient to\ntransform the (r, \u03b8) coordinate system through a conformal transformation to a new, finite domain (\u03b6, \u03b8) with\n\u03b6 \u2208 [0, 1]:\n\u03b6(\u03b8) = R(\u03b8, t)/r .\n\n(19)\n\nIn the finite space all the derivatives are computed using\nfinite differences and are redefined for the transformed\nspace using the chain rule: \u2202xi = \u2202xi xk \u2202xk .

For the sake of numerical\nstability small viscosity terms were added to the acceleration components. The coupled equations were solved\nusing K = 100 and \u03bc = 50. Since the speed of sound is\norders of magnitude larger than the velocity of the interface, we could safely neglect the effects of Eq. (2), giving\n\nRadius\n\n1.02\n1.01\n1\n0.99\n0\n\npi/2\n\u03b8\n\npi\n\nFIG. 1: A typical half profile of the stressed interface under\nthe action of surface diffusion and plastiticity.

The initial condition on\nthe perturbed circle were\nR(t = 0, \u03b8) = 1 + 0.01 cos 2\u03b8 ,\n\n(21)\n\nthe stress at infinity was chosen to be \u03c3\u221e = 0.9sy . The\nPoisson ratio \u03bd in Eq. (18) is 1/3. The surface diffusion equations contain fourth order derivatives, calling\nfor spectral techniques for sufficiently stable evaluation.\nAll the other derivatives were computed by finite differences.\nResults and Discussion: The typical morphology of\nthe unstable interface is shown in Fig. 1 The elastic\nsolution for the finite-time singularity is well established\nand was reproduced in our numerics. The curvature \u03ba\nin the growing cusp first grows exponentially and rapidly\nswitches to faster regime that agrees with the growth law\n\u03ba(t) \u221d (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u22121/2 .\n\n(22)\n\nTo make this growth obvious we plotted the curvature of\nthe elastic solution in Fig. 2 as a function of (t\u2217 \u2212 t)\u22121/2\nwith t\u2217 = 5.37 \u00d7 10\u22124. Once plasticity is allowed to intervene, it prevents the finite-time singularity by blunting\nthe tip and by dissipating the stress.\n\n\f4\n\n1.5\n\nx 10\n\n\u22123\n\nA\nv\n\nn\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n5.02\n\n5.04\n\n5.06\n\n5.08\nsd\nt/\u03c40\n\n5.1\n\n5.08\n\n5.1\n\n5.12\nx 10\n\n\u22124\n\n300\n\u2202 vn / \u2202 t\n\nB\n200\n\nWithout it, the stressed circle would remain stable to\nsmall shape fluctuations, as was demonstrated recently in\n[16]. The surface diffusion makes the circle unstable, and\nthe instability results in the growth of a groove. Without plasticity in the bulk the solution loses its meaning\nat t = t\u2217 , whereas now, with plasticity playing its useful role, the solutions continue to exist at times t > t\u2217 ,\nin a form of a lengthening groove, or crack, whose tip is\nprotected from cusping by the plastic effects. At some\npoint the crack will increase its velocity due to the Griffith mechanism, and then the problem becomes inertial\nagain.\n\n100\n0\n\n5.02\n\n5.04\n\n5.06\n\nt/\u03c4sd\n0\n\n\u22022 vn / \u2202 t2\n\n6\n\nx 10\n\n5.12\nx 10\n\n\u22124\n\n7\n\nC\n4\n2\n0\n\n5.02\n\n5.04\n\n5.06\n\n5.08\nsd\nt/\u03c40\n\n5.1\n\n5.12\nx 10\n\n\u22124\n\nFIG. 3: The tip velocity (panel A), its first and second time\nderivatives (panels B and C respectively). We see that the\nsingularity is cured and the velocity decelerates due to the\nplastic effects.\n\nOn the boundary, the smoothening of the interface in\nthe vicinity of the cusp via blunting is the \"cure\" of the\nsingularity. The ever-increasing curvature occurring in\nthe elastic solution is prevented in the plastic solution\nby the plastic flow induced by stress concentration. The\navoidance of the singularity is shown by the deceleration\nin the tip velocity, see Fig. 3 panels B and C.\nIt is important to stress that although the plasticity in\nthe bulk succeeds to cure the finite-time cusp-singularity,\nthe role of surface diffusion is far from being negligible.\n\n[1] W.
