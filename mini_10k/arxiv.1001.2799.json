We discuss the implications of collective\nneutrino flavor oscillations for core collapse supernova physics and for the prospects of obtaining\nfundamental neutrino properties, e.g., the neutrino mass hierarchy and \u03b813 from a future observed\nsupernova neutrino signal.\n\nI.\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNeutrino mixing and astrophysics\n\nNeutrinos and the phenomena associated with neutrino flavor transformation stand at the nexus of two exciting\nrecent developments: the success of experimental neutrino physics; and the tremendous growth of astronomy and\nastrophysics. The former enterprise has given key insights into neutrino mass and vacuum mixing and promises more\n[1], while the latter is providing fundamental cosmological parameters and is revealing how structure and elemental\nabundances emerge and evolve in the universe [2\u20135]. Moreover, there is feedback between these subjects. For example,\nobservations of large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background radiation currently provide our best limits\non the neutrino rest masses [6, 7]. In fact, both the early universe and the massive star core collapse and supernova\nexplosion environments can be dominated by neutrinos. Neutrino flavor transformation in each of these environments\nmay give insights into astrophysics and even possibly into fundamental neutrino properties. Obtaining these insights\nwill require confident modeling of neutrino flavor evolution in environments where neutrino-neutrino interactions\nproduce vexing nonlinearity. In any case, the neutrino mass and mixing data already gathered from the experiments\nmake a compelling case that we must solve this problem.\nExperiments and observations to date have established that the neutrino energy (mass) states |\u03bdi i (i = 1, 2, 3)\nare not coincident\nP \u2217 with the weak interaction states |\u03bd\u03b1 i (\u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ). The relation between these bases is given\n|\u03bdi i [8], where the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) matrix elements U\u03b1i are parameterized by three\nby |\u03bd\u03b1 i = i U\u03b1i\nvacuum mixing angles (\u03b812 , \u03b823 , \u03b813 ) and a CP -violating phase \u03b4. Two of these are measured outright, sin2 \u03b812 \u2248 0.31\nand sin2 \u03b823 \u2248 0.5, while there is a firm upper limit on a third, sin2 \u03b813 < 0.04 at 2\u03c3 [9]. Observations of solar neutrinos\nshow flavor conversion in the \u03bde \u21cb \u03bd\u03bc/\u03c4 channel with a characteristic mass-squared splitting \u2206m2\u2299 \u2248 7.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 .\nAtmospheric neutrino measurements show near maximal vacuum mixing in the \u03bd\u03bc \u21cb \u03bd\u03c4 channel with corresponding\nmass-squared splitting \u2206m2atm \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 . However, experiments do not reveal the absolute neutrino rest\nmasses mi (i = 1, 2, 3), nor do they show whether these neutrino mass eigenvalues are ordered in the normal mass\nhierarchy (m3 > m2 > m1 ) or in the inverted mass hierarchy (m2 > m1 > m3 ).\nFuture terrestrial neutrino experiments [10\u201315] will be directed primarily towards measuring \u03b813 and, if \u03b813 is big\nenough, the neutrino mass hierarchy and possibly even the CP -violating phase \u03b4. The planned reactor and long\nbaseline experiments may be able to measure \u03b813 if it satisfies sin2 \u03b813 > 10\u22124 . This limit is set ultimately by\nconstraints on the neutrino flux and detector mass. To find significantly larger neutrino fluxes we must turn to cosmic\nsources, e.g., core collapse supernovae [16\u201323].\nStars more massive than \u223c 8 M\u2299 end their lives in gravitational collapse and the production of a neutron star\nor, if they are massive enough, a black hole remnant [24\u201327]. Neutrinos play a role in nearly every aspect of the\nevolution of these core collapse supernovae, from dominating lepton number and entropy loss from the epoch of core\ncarbon/oxygen burning onward, to providing the bulk of energy and lepton number transport during collapse itself,\nand even to providing the heating necessary to engender convection [28\u201333] and, e.g., the Standing Accretion Shock\nInstability (SASI) which may create an explosion [34, 35].\nA key point is that gravitational collapse causes an appreciable fraction of the rest mass of the Chandrasekhar-mass\n(\u223c 1.4 M\u2299) core to appear as seas of trapped neutrinos which subsequently diffuse out of the core on time scales of\nseconds [36\u201338]. At core bounce, the energy in the neutrino seas trapped in the core is \u223c 1052 ergs, but by \u223c 10 s\nafter core bounce some 1053 ergs, or \u223c 10% of the rest mass of the core has been radiated away as neutrinos of all\n\n\f2\nkinds. The emergent neutrino and antineutrino energy spectra and fluxes at the neutrino sphere vary with time\npost-core-bounce, but there will be epochs where the energy spectra and/or the luminosities in the various neutrino\nflavors will differ. Moreover, the charged-current, flavor specific neutrino interaction processes such as \u03bde + n \u21cb p + e\u2212\nand \u03bd\u0304e + p \u21cb n + e+ are important both for energy and electron lepton number deposition as well as for determining\nneutrino transport physics [39\u201341]. It is therefore interesting and necessary to assess whether interconversion of\nneutrino flavors in the supernova environment affects explosion physics and neutrino-heated nucleosynthesis and how\nsuch flavor transformation might affect a supernova neutrino burst signature in a terrestrial detector.\nB.\n\nBrief history of collective neutrino oscillations\n\nEarly studies of neutrino flavor transformation centered on solar neutrinos, especially after it was recognized first by\nWolfenstein [42], and then Mikheyev and Smirnov [43], that the medium through which the neutrino propagates could\nalter the effective neutrino mass and mixing properties. Almost immediately after the Mikhyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein\n(MSW) mechanism was understood, it was realized that the forward coherent scattering of neutrinos with other\nneutrinos, somewhat misleadingly called \"neutrino self-coupling\" or \"neutrino self-interaction\", could generate a\nsimilar effect [44, 45]. Subsequently, the effects of neutrino self-interaction were investigated independently in the\ncore collapse supernova and the early universe scenarios. The studies of the supernova environment first focused on\nMSW-like effects [39, 46\u201349]. However, it was pointed out that the neutrino self-interaction potential is very different\nfrom the matter potential in that it can have non-vanishing off-diagonal elements in the interaction basis [50, 51].\nStudies using the complete neutrino self-interaction potential showed that neutrinos could experience \"self-maintained\ncoherent oscillations\" or \"collective oscillations\" in lepton-degenerate early universe scenarios [52\u201362]. By collective\noscillations we mean a significant fraction of neutrinos oscillate coherently with respect to each other.\nEarly research on MSW-like evolution, where the flavor off-diagonal potentials were minimal, as well as the first\npaper [63] to point out that collective effects could occur in supernovae all focused on relatively large neutrino\nmass-squared differences. However, it was eventually realized that neutrinos and antineutrinos could be transformed\ncollectively and simultaneously even for the small, measured neutrino mass-squared differences [64, 65]. Additionally,\nReference [66] showed that ordinary matter does not necessarily suppress collective neutrino oscillations, at least in\nhomogeneous and isotropic environments. It was then demonstrated that collective neutrino oscillations indeed can\noccur in a spherically symmetric supernova model [67, 68]. These works showed that the neutrino energy spectra\nwould be modified differently for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies (see Figure 1). Over the\npast few years, many papers have been written on the collective neutrino oscillation phenomenon and its physical\neffects [69\u2013108]. Following this literature can be bewildering. For example, the synchronized and bipolar neutrino\noscillations are frequently perceived as the two most important collective neutrino oscillation modes in supernovae.\nHowever, numerical studies suggest that supernova neutrinos are probably never synchronized because of the nonvanishing matter density [74], and the bipolar oscillation is not a collective neutrino oscillation mode in anisotropic\nenvironments such as supernovae [70].\nC.\n\nGoal and organization of this review\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a relatively short but in-depth review of the properties of collective neutrino\noscillations that are reasonably well understood. In particular, we wish to elucidate the physics behind the striking\nfeatures such as the swaps of supernova neutrino energy spectra caused by collective oscillations as shown in Figure 1.\nOur strategy is to illustrate key facets of collective neutrino oscillations by describing three, increasingly more complex\nmodels.\nThe rest of the review is organized as follows. In Section II we try to make the connection between the \"wavefunction\nlanguage\" and the \"spin language\", commonly used for studying non-collective and collective neutrino oscillations,\nrespectively. In Section III we discuss the flavor evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas that consists\ninitially of mono-energetic pure \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e . This simple model can be solved analytically and offers important insights\ninto the behavior of more complicated systems. In Section IV we discuss homogeneous and isotropic gases that consist\nof neutrinos with continuous energy spectra. We explore adiabatic solutions to the neutrino flavor evolution equations\nand demonstrate how the spectral swap/split phenomenon can be explained by one of these solutions. In Section V\nwe discuss some of the important neutrino oscillation properties that are unique to anisotropic environments and\nexplain why the spectral swap/split phenomenon may occur in these environments despite the anisotropy in neutrino\nfields. In Section VI we apply the current understanding of collective neutrino oscillation phenomenon to supernova\nenvironments. In Section VII we give a summary and point out several issues in collective neutrino oscillations that\nremain to be understood.\n\n\fP\u03bd\u03bd\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\ncos \u03b8R\n\ncos \u03b8R\n\n3\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0\n0\n\n60\n\n20\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0\n\nE (MeV)\n\n1\n\ncos \u03b8R\n\ncos \u03b8R\n\nE (MeV)\n\n40\n\n1\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0\n0\n\nE (MeV)\n\n20\nE (MeV)\n\nFIG. 1: Survival probabilities P\u03bd\u03bd for neutrinos (left panels) and antineutrinos (right panels) as functions of both neutrino\nenergy E and emission angle \u03b8R in a numerical calculation using the neutrino bulb model (see Figure 3) and the two-flavor\nmixing scheme. The most prominent features on this figure are the approximately angle-independent step-like changes in the\nneutrino survival probabilities (left panels) - these are the spectral swaps/splits discovered in Reference [68]. The energy\nspectra of \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc with energy below (above) E \u2243 9 MeV in this calculation are almost completely swapped in the upper\n(lower) panels which employ the normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy. Spectral swaps/splits are the result of a collective\nneutrino oscillation mode, the precession mode, which is one of the main topics of this review. The vertical fringes (the energydependent features in the figure) are the result of MSW flavor transformation which is energy dependent. The horizontal fringes\n(the angle-dependent features) are the result of the kinematic decoherence of bipolar neutrino oscillations [70] (see Section V A).\nThe movie version of these calculations is available in Reference [85].

We do this for pedagogical purposes, although this is physically justifiable because the\nphysical \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 are nearly maximally mixed in vacuum and experience nearly identical interactions in the supernova\nenvironment [109, 110]. We will discuss collective neutrino oscillations with the full three-flavor mixing machinery in\nSection IV C. We consider only coherent neutrino flavor evolution, where the effects of neutrino inelastic scattering\n\n\f4\nand associated quantum decoherence can be neglected. This will be generally applicable in the region well above the\nneutron star in supernova models. (Solution of the complete problem of neutrino flavor evolution with both elastic\nand inelastic neutrino scattering would necessitate the use of the full quantum kinetic equations [7, 41, 111\u2013113].) We\nalso assume that neutrinos are relativistic and that general relativistic effects can be ignored. With these assumptions,\na mean-field Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation\ni\n\nd\n\u03c8 = H\u03c8\ndx\n\n(1)\n\nis taken to describe flavor evolution along a neutrino world line [114]. Here, we take ~ = c = 1, x is the distance along\nthe world line of the neutrino, \u03c8 is the neutrino flavor wavefunction, taken to be a vector in (neutrino) flavor space,\nand\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2206m2\n\u2206m2\n(2)\nB + \u03bbL + H\u03bd\u03bd =\nB + 2GF ne L + 2GF d3 p\u2032 (1 \u2212 p\u0302 * p\u0302\u2032 )(\u03c1p\u2032 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304p\u2032 )\nH=\n2E\n2E\nis the Hamiltonian. (See References [115\u2013119] for discussions of the applicability of the one-particle effective approximation assumed in Equation (1).)

The flavor space is spanned by the neutrino interaction\nbasis or, equivalently, spanned by the mass basis. We will use the word \"flavor\" in a more general sense and we will\navoid the phrase \"flavor state\", which in the literature can be taken to mean either the interaction state |\u03bd\u03b1 i or the\nflavor quantum state |\u03c8i . (We will use symbols in the sans serif font, e.g., H, to denote basis-dependent matrices in\nflavor space.)\nThe first term in Equation (2) induces neutrino flavor transformation because in the interaction basis\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\n1\n1 \u2212 cos 2\u03b8v sin 2\u03b8v\n(3)\nB=U\ndiag[\u22121, 1] U\u2020 =\n2\n2 sin 2\u03b8v cos 2\u03b8v\nis non-diagonal. In Equation (3), U is the MNS matrix, and \u03b8v is the so-called vacuum mixing angle and is within\nthe range (0, \u03c0/4]. In Equation (2) \u2206m2 is the mass-squared difference appropriate for |\u03bd2 i and |\u03bd1 i, and E is the\nenergy of the neutrino. Here \u2206m2 > 0 and \u2206m2 < 0 correspond to the normal neutrino mass hierarchy (NH) and the\ninverted neutrino mass hierarchy (IH), respectively, as discussed above for the full three-flavor mixing case. Although\nthis formalism is completely general, one of the most interesting supernova cases is where |\u2206m2 | \u2243 \u2206m2atm and\n\u03b8v \u2243 \u03b813 \u226a 1.\nThe second term in Equation (2) arises from coherent neutrino-electron forward exchange scattering [42]. In this\nterm, which is referred to as the matter term, GF is the Fermi constant, ne is the net electron number density, and\nL = diag[1, 0] in the interaction basis. Note that adding/subtracting a multiple of the identity matrix to/from H (e.g.,\nthe contribution of neutral-current neutrino-electron scattering) gives only an overall phase to \u03c8 and, therefore, does\nnot affect neutrino oscillations.\nThe last term in Equation (2) stems from coherent neutral-current neutrino-neutrino forward exchange scattering\n[44\u201346, 50], where p\u0302 and p\u0302\u2032 are the unit vectors for the propagation directions of the test neutrino and the background\nneutrino or antineutrino, respectively. In the interaction basis, at location x and at time t, the (flavor) density matrices\nfor neutrinos and antineutrinos with momentum p\u2032 and with our assumptions can be written as\nX\n[\u03c1p\u2032 (t, x)]\u03b1\u03b2 =\n(4a)\nn\u03bd \u2032 ,p\u2032 (t, x)h\u03bd\u03b1 |\u03c8\u03bd \u2032 ,p\u2032 (t, x)ih\u03c8\u03bd \u2032 ,p\u2032 (t, x)|\u03bd\u03b2 i,\n\u03bd\u2032\n\n[\u03c1\u0304p\u2032 (t, x)]\u03b2\u03b1 =\n\nX\n\u03bd\u0304 \u2032\n\nn\u03bd\u0304 \u2032 ,p\u2032 (t, x)h\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 |\u03c8\u03bd\u0304 \u2032 ,p\u2032 (t, x)ih\u03c8\u03bd\u0304 \u2032 ,p\u2032 (t, x)|\u03bd\u0304\u03b2 i,\n\n(4b)\n\nrespectively, where |\u03c8\u03bd \u2032 (\u03bd\u0304 \u2032 ),p\u2032 i is the state of a neutrino \u03bd \u2032 (antineutrino \u03bd\u0304 \u2032 ) with momentum p\u2032 , and n\u03bd \u2032 ,p\u2032 (n\u03bd\u0304 \u2032 ,p\u2032 )\nis the corresponding number density of the neutrino (antineutrino). Note that the order of the indices on the matrix\nrepresentation of \u03c1\u0304 in Equation (4b) follows the convention in Reference [111]. The advantage of this definition is\nthat \u03c1\u0304 will transform in the same way as does \u03c1 when transforming from the interaction basis to the mass basis or\nvice versa.\nB.\n\nNeutrino flavor polarization vector\n\nIt becomes more difficult to analyze neutrino oscillations using the wavefunction formalism when H\u03bd\u03bd is significant.\nThis is because H\u03bd\u03bd is a sum of density matrices which involve bilinear forms of the wavefunctions.

See also Reference [120]\nH\nfor a more detailed discussion on this geometric interpretation.\n\nmatrices contain all the physical information for the neutrino mixing problem. The diagonal elements of the density\nmatrices give the number densities of neutrinos in the weak interaction states or the mass states, depending on\nthe basis used, and the off-diagonal elements of the density matrices contain the neutrino mixing information. For\nsimplicity let us first take a working example, a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas whose flavor content can vary\nwith time t. Homogeneity and isotropy implies that the factor (1 \u2212 p\u0302* p\u0302\u2032 ) in Equation (2) averages to 1. Therefore, the\nneutrino propagation direction does not matter, and \u03c1p (t, x) \u2192 \u03c1E (t) and \u03c1\u0304p (t, x) \u2192 \u03c1\u0304E (t).

(We use symbols with the vector hat, e.g., P , to denote a vector in flavor space\nand symbols in the bold font, e.g., p, to denote a vector in physical three-dimensional coordinate space.) We note\nthat P~\u03c9 can be normalized by an arbitrary factor. For example, if P~\u03c9 is normalized to unity, then \u03c1E \u221d (1 + 12 P~\u03c9 * ~\u03c3 )\nfor neutrinos and \u03c1\u0304E \u221d (1 \u2212 12 P~\u03c9 * ~\u03c3 ) for antineutrinos. In Equation (6) we defined P~\u03c9 to be normalized by n\u03bd ,\nthe initial total number density\n\u221a of a certain neutrino species \u03bd which is chosen to be \u03bd\u0304e in the rest of the review.\nHowever, we usually take \u03bc = 2GF n\u03bd as a measure of the strength of neutrino self-interaction. Therefore, in some\ncases it is more appropriate to normalize P~\u03c9 by the number density of other neutrino species, e.g., when n\u03bd\u0304e is\n(I)\nnegligible. If neutrinos and antineutrinos are all in the interaction states, then P~\u03c9 \u221d (n\u03bde ,\u03c9 \u2212 n\u03bd\u03bc ,\u03c9 )\u00ea3 for neutrinos\n(I)\nand P~\u03c9 \u221d \u2212(n\u03bd\u0304e ,\u03c9 \u2212 n\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ,\u03c9 )\u00ea3 for antineutrinos, where n\u03bd,\u03c9 (\u03bd = \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304e , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) is the corresponding number density\n(I)\nin the neutrino or antineutrino mode \u03c9, and \u00ea3 is one of the interaction basis vectors.\nSince the Pauli matrices are traceless, the trace of the density matrix is not contained in the polarization vector.\nAccording to Equation (5) the traces of the density matrices do not change with time. (This corresponds to one of\n\nwhere the (angular) vacuum oscillation frequency is \u03c9 =\n\n\f6\nour assumptions that neutrinos are not created or annihilated.) These terms can be easily reintroduced, e.g., for the\ncalculation of the neutrino energy spectra. Using Equations (5) and (6) it can be shown that\n \u0307\n~ + \u03bbL\n~ + \u03bcD)\n~ \u00d7 P~\u03c9 ,\nP~\u03c9 = (\u03c9 B\n\n(7)\n\n~ = Tr(B ~\u03c3 ) and L\n~ = Tr(L ~\u03c3 ) are parallel to the (vacuum) mass and interaction basis vectors \u00ea(V)\nwhere vectors B\n3\nR\n(I)\n~ = \u221e P~\u03c9 d\u03c9 is the total polarization vector. In the absence of neutrino\nand \u00ea3 , respectively (see Figure 2), and D\n\u2212\u221e\nself-coupling, P~\u03c9 can be thought of as a \"magnetic spin\". In this analogy the \"magnetic spin\" is coupled to two\n~ and L,\n~ with gyromagnetic ratios \u2212\u03c9 and \u2212\u03bb, respectively. (Note that a real magnetic spin s\n\"magnetic fields\", B\nwith the gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 in the presence of magnetic field B obeys EoM \u1e61 = \u2212\u03b3B \u00d7 s.) Equivalently, P~\u03c9 behaves\n~ = \u03c9B\n~ + \u03bbL\n~ with \"gyromagnetic ratio\" \u22121. This picture\nlike a \"magnetic spin\" coupled to the total \"magnetic field\" H\nallows geometric interpretations for both vacuum oscillations and MSW flavor transformation (see Figure 2).\nA few comments about the polarization vector notation are in order before we consider neutrino self-coupling. (a)\nThe polarization vector notation is fully equivalent to the neutrino flavor isospin (NFIS) notation [66] where the NFIS\n~\nfor a neutrino or antineutrino is ~s\u03c9 = 12 |PP~\u03c9 | . (b) In Equation (6) P~\u03c9 is defined with a minus sign for the antineutrino.\n\u03c9\nAlthough the physics is not changed by the choice of notation, our definition of P~\u03c9 is convenient in analyzing collective\nneutrino oscillations when both neutrinos and antineutrinos are present (see Section II C). This notation has been\nadopted in most recent literature.\nC.\n\nSynchronized neutrino oscillations, corotating frames and matter effects\n\nThe neutrino self-coupling is represented as the coupling between polarization vectors in Equation (7). To have\na feeling for the effect of this coupling, let us consider a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas with \u03bb = 0 and\n\u03bc = const. Using Equation (7) it can be shown that the \"total energy of the magnetic spins\"\nZ \u221e\n\u03bc ~2\n~\nE=\n\u03c9(P~\u03c9 * B)d\u03c9\n+ D\n(8)\n2\n\u2212\u221e\nis constant in this case [66], where the first term is the \"total energy\" of coupling between the \"magnetic\np field\"\n~ \u2243 2E/\u03bc is\nand \"spins\", and the second term is the \"total spin-spin coupling energy\". If \u03bc is large, then |D|\napproximately constant. This implies that a dense neutrino gas can experience \"self-maintained coherent oscillations\"\n[56]. For example, if a dense neutrino gas consists initially of neutrinos of the same flavor (so that all P~\u03c9 are initially\naligned), then the flavor evolution of these neutrinos is coherent (i.e., all P~\u03c9 remain aligned) even when they have\ndifferent energies. This phenomenon has been termed synchronized neutrino oscillations, because all neutrinos (and\nantineutrinos) in such a system oscillate collectively with (angular) frequency \u03a9sync . The synchronized oscillation\nfrequency is an average of all \u03c9's [60]:\nZ \u221e\n\u22122\n~\n~ * P~\u03c9 )\u03c9d\u03c9.\n\u03a9sync = |D|\n(D\n(9)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nConsider another neutrino system that is similar to the synchronized system discussed above except that the\noscillation frequency \u03c9 of each neutrino or antineutrino is shifted by a common value \u03c90 . Any polarization vector, say\nP~\u03c9 , in this system should move in a way similar to P~\u03c9\u2212\u03c90 in the synchronized system, except for an extra precession\n~ with frequency \u03c90 . In other words, this system behaves just like the synchronized system in a reference\nabout B\n~ with frequency \u03c90 . Indeed, in this non-inertial corotating frame [66], each polarization\nframe that rotates about B\n~ and Equation (7) (with \u03bb = 0) becomes\nvector is coupled to a non-physical field \u2212\u03c90 B\n \u0307\n~ + \u03bcD]\n~ \u00d7 P~\u03c9 .\nP~\u03c9 = [(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )B\n\n(10)\n\nTherefore, this neutrino system experiences synchronized flavor transformation, just like the one discussed above, but\nwith \u03a9sync shifted by \u03c90 . Because the oscillation frequency \u03c9 can be shifted to any value by using an appropriate\ncorotating frame, the criterion for synchronization should not be \u03bc \u226b |h\u03c9i| but rather \u03bc \u226b \u2206\u03c9 [66], where h\u03c9i and\n\u2206\u03c9 are the average value and the spread in \u03c9 for the neutrino system, respectively. Note that the reversal of the\ndirection of P~\u03c9 for the antineutrino (Equation (6)) is important when the corotating frame is used.

The supernova environment\nis far more complex than the early universe, in part because of its inhomogeneity and anisotropy. This complexity\nis enhanced because neutrinos of different flavors and energies and propagating in different directions are coupled\nby neutrino self-interaction [48]. Full simulations of neutrino oscillations with neutrino self-interaction in a general\nsupernova environment are beyond current numerical capabilities. Here we briefly discuss two schemes commonly\nused in investigating collective neutrino oscillations. Both of these schemes employ the neutrino bulb model where\nthe supernova environment is spherically symmetric around the center of the proto-neutron star (PNS) (see Figure 3).\nThe polarization vectors in this model obey EoM\ncos \u03b8\n\nd ~\n~ + \u03bb(r)L\n~ +H\n~ \u03bd\u03bd,\u03b8 (r)] \u00d7 P~\u03c9,\u03b8 (r),\nP\u03c9,\u03b8 (r) = [\u03c9 B\ndr\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\n~ \u03bd\u03bd,\u03b8 (r) =\nH\n\nZ\n\u221a\n2GF n\u03bd\u0304e (R)\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c9 \u2032\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ncos \u03b8max\n\nd(cos \u03b8\u2032 ) (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8\u2032 )P~\u03c9\u2032 ,\u03b8\u2032 (r).\n\n(13)\n\nNote that the maximum value of \u03b8(r) is \u03b8max = arcsin(R/r) in the neutrino bulb model (see Figure 3). Also note\nthat here we choose to normalize P~\u03c9 by n\u03bd\u0304e (R) = L\u03bd\u0304e /(2\u03c0R2 hE\u03bd\u0304e i), the total number density of \u03bd\u0304e at the neutrino\nsphere, where L\u03bd\u0304e and hE\u03bd\u0304e i are the energy luminosity and the spectrum-averaged energy of \u03bd\u0304e at the neutrino sphere,\nrespectively. For the neutronization-burst epoch where the \u03bde flux is much larger than the fluxes of all other neutrino\nspecies, P~\u03c9 should be normalized by n\u03bde (R) instead. In typical numerical simulations, R is in the range of 10\u201360\nkm, and the luminosities and the average energies of neutrinos are in the ranges of 1050 \u20131053 erg/s and 10\u201330 MeV,\nrespectively.\nEquation (12) can be solved numerically without any further assumptions. This is the \"multi-angle scheme\". The\nother scheme is the so-called \"single-angle scheme\". In this latter scheme it is assumed that P~\u03c9,\u03b8 (r) = P~\u03c9 (r) is the\n\n\f8\nsame for different neutrino trajectories. There are several variants of the single-angle scheme. These variants lead\nto qualitatively similar results. In one of the variants P~\u03c9 (r) is computed along the radial direction (\u03b8R = 0) and\nEquation (12) becomes\n\u221a\nd ~\n~ + \u03bb(r)L\n~ + 2GF n\u03bd\u0304e D(r/R)D]\n~ \u00d7 P~\u03c9 (r),\nP\u03c9 (r) = [\u03c9 B\n(14)\ndr\nq\ni2\nh\nwhere the geometric factor D(r/R) = 12 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 ( Rr )2 partially accounts for the angle effect and geometric\ndilution of the neutrino fluxes in the neutrino bulb model. Comparing Equations (7) and (14), it is clear that the\nflavor evolution of neutrinos in the single-angle scheme is equivalent to that of a homogeneous and\n\u221a isotropic neutrino\ngas expanding with \"time\" r. In this analogy the strength of the neutrino self-coupling is \u03bc(r) = 2GF n\u03bd\u0304e (R)D(r/R).\nThe radial direction is a rather special direction in the neutrino bulb model. In another variant of the single-angle\n~ \u03bd\u03bd,\u03b8 can be averaged over\nscheme it is assumed that all neutrinos are emitted with \u03b8R = \u03c0/4 [73]. Alternatively, H\nneutrino trajectories [68, 88]. Each of these variants also leads to Equation (14) when r \u226b R. However, in this limit\n\u00014\nD(r/R) \u2192 41 Rr for these variants instead of 18 ( Rr )4 in the single-angle scheme which employs the radial trajectory.\nThese variants can improve the agreement between the results of the single-angle and multi-angle calculations [88].\nAlthough the single-angle scheme is frequently used for its simplicity, it must be emphasized that it misses some\nof the important properties (e.g., anisotropy) of the neutrino bulb model and can lead to incorrect results when such\nproperties play important roles in collective neutrino oscillations (see Section V).\nIII.\nA.\n\nSIMPLE BIPOLAR NEUTRINO SYSTEMS\nBipolar systems and the flavor pendulum\n\nTo illustrate another important example of collective neutrino oscillations, let us consider a homogeneous and\nisotropic gas that initially consists of mono-energetic \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e . This neutrino system is represented by two polarization\nvectors, P~\u03c9 and P~\u2212\u03c9 for the neutrino and the antineutrino, respectively. We assume that \u03bb = 0, \u03bc is fixed, and that\n|P~\u03c9 | = (1+\u03b5)|P~\u2212\u03c9 |, where \u03b5 is the fractional excess of neutrinos over antineutrinos. At t = 0, P~\u03c9 points in the direction\n(I)\n(V)\nof \u00ea3 , which is tilted away from \u00ea3 by 2\u03b8v , and P~\u2212\u03c9 points in the direction opposite to P~\u03c9 . Neutrino systems that\nare represented by two nearly oppositely directed polarization vector groups are called \"bipolar systems\". Using the\ncorotating frame technique, the discussion in this section easily can be applied to, e.g., a gas consisting initially of \u03bde\nand \u03bd\u03bc with energies E\u03bde 6= E\u03bd\u03bc .\n(V)\n~ (i.e., \u03b8v = 0). Using energy conservation\nA peculiar case is where \u03b5 = 0 and P~\u03c9 initially is aligned with \u00ea3 = \u2212B\n~\n~\n(Equation (8)) it can be shown [66] that if \u03c9 > 0, neither P\u03c9 nor P\u2212\u03c9 will move, and so the initial configuration of the\nsystem is absolutely stable. On the other hand, if \u03c9 < 0 and \u03bc \u226b |\u03c9|, P~\u03c9 and P~\u2212\u03c9 can nearly swap their directions\n(but with a slight bend towards each other). This implies that the initial configuration of the system is unstable.\nTherefore, the \u03bde \u2013\u03bd\u0304e system may experience insignificant flavor oscillations when \u2206m2 > 0 and \u03b8v \u226a 1. However,\nthis system can experience significant flavor oscillations when \u2206m2 < 0 and \u03b8v \u226a 1.

Significant neutrino oscillations can occur in this case. If the neutrino\ndensity decreases, the mass \u03bc\u22121 of the pendulum becomes larger. The swing amplitude of the pendulum that represents\na symmetric bipolar system decreases as \u03bc decreases.

Let\nus first seek static solutions to the EoM for the polarization vectors (Equation (7)) in the case where both the matter\n\n\f10\ndensity and the neutrino densities are constant. One possibility is that the solution is stationary and the P~\u03c9 's do\nnot evolve with time t. This is only possible if the \"spin\" P~\u03c9 is parallel to the corresponding total \"magnetic field\"\n~ \u03c9 = \u03c9B\n~ + \u03bbL\n~ + \u03bcD.\n~ For this case, and noting that H\n~ \u03c9 does not depend on P~\u03c9 , we can obtain the following equations\nH\n~ [74]:\nfor the total polarization vector D\nD1 = (\u03bb sin 2\u03b8v + \u03bcD1 )\nD2 = \u03bcD2\nD3 =\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u01eb\u03c9 |P~\u03c9 |\nd\u03c9,\n~ \u03c9|\n|H\n\n\u01eb\u03c9 |P~\u03c9 |\nd\u03c9,\n~ \u03c9|\n|H\n\n(\u2212\u03c9 + \u03bb cos 2\u03b8v + \u03bcD3 )\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(18a)\n(18b)\n\n\u01eb\u03c9 |P~\u03c9 |\nd\u03c9,\n~ \u03c9|\n|H\n\n(18c)\n\n~ * \u00ea(V)\n~ \u03c9 .

We note that Equations (18a) and\n(V)\n(18b) generally imply that D2 = 0 if \u03bb 6= 0 which, in turn, implies that P~\u03c9 * \u00ea2 = 0 for any \u03c9.\n~ is underconstrained by Equation (18) in this case.\nEquations (18a) and (18b) become equivalent when \u03bb = 0, and D\n~\n~ In other words, if {P~\u03c9 (t)| \u2200\u03c9}\nThis is because when \u03bb = 0, the EoM for P\u03c9 possesses a rotational symmetry about B.\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~ by an\nsolves the EoM, then {P~\u03c9 (t)| \u2200\u03c9} also solves the EoM, where P~\u03c9 (t) is obtained from P~\u03c9 (t) by rotation about B\narbitrary angle \u03c6. Here \u03c6 is independent of \u03c9 and t. This is a generalization of the rotational symmetry of the flavor\n~ Such a symmetry generally implies the existence of a collective motion\npendulum about the \"gravity\" vector ~g \u221d B.\nand a conservation law. For example, a translational symmetry of a group of particles along some direction implies\nthe possibility of the collective motion of the particles in that direction and the conservation of the total momentum\nof the particles in the same direction. In Section III it was shown that this rotational symmetry implies the possibility\nof a pure precession of the flavor pendulum in which both polarization vectors of the simple bipolar system precess\nwith the same frequency \u03a9. Therefore, it is natural to seek a static solution to the EoM with \u03bb = 0, and \u03bc constant,\n~ with the same frequency \u03a9. In this case all the P~\u03c9 's are stationary in a\nand in which all the P~\u03c9 's precess about B\n~\ncorotating frame which rotates about B with frequency \u03a9. In this corotating frame, P~\u03c9 is either aligned or antialigned\n~ = (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9)B\n~ + \u03bcD,\n~ and the components of D\n~ in the corotating frame can be found from equations similar to\nwith H\u0303\n\u03c9\nEquation (18). These equations can be recast as the following two simple sum rules [72]:\n1=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a9=\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u01eb\u03c9 |P~\u03c9 |\np\nd\u03c9,\n2\n[(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9)/\u03bc + D3 ]2 + D\u22a5\n\u01eb\u03c9 \u03c9|P~\u03c9 |\np\nd\u03c9,\n2\n[(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9)/\u03bc + D3 ]2 + D\u22a5\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\n~\n~ that is perpendicular to \u00ea(V) . The rotational symmetry of the system about B\nwhere D\u22a5 is the component of D\n3\n~ *B\n~ is constant.\nimplies that D3 = \u2212D\nB.\n\nAdiabatic solutions and the spectral swap/split\n\nIf \u03bb and \u03bc vary slowly with time, adiabatic solutions can be obtained which correspond to the static solutions\ndiscussed above. We shall term these the (adiabatic, \u03bd-enhanced) MSW solution and the (adiabatic) precession\nsolution. Figure 5 shows these two adiabatic solutions for a single-angle scheme together with the corresponding\nnumerical solutions for Equation (14). In these calculations it is assumed that the most abundant neutrino species at\nthe neutrino sphere are \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e , and that \u03b8v \u226a 1. For the precession solution the matter field is \"removed\" using\nan appropriate corotating frame. The flavor pendulum model provides insight into how the numerical solution evolves\nfrom the MSW solution towards the precession solution. In the IH case a large matter density essentially keeps the\nflavor pendulum (with \u03b5 > 0) near its highest position. This configuration becomes unstable when \u03bc < \u03bccr . In the\nNH case the \u03bd-enhanced MSW flavor transformation has the effect of raising the flavor pendulum to near its highest\nposition, and the configuration is again unstable when \u03bc < \u03bccr .\nJust as in the conventional adiabatic MSW flavor transformation case (Figure 2), in the adiabatic precession\n~ which changes its direction (and magnitude) as \u03bc decreases.

When \u03bc \u226b \u03c90 , all neutrinos are in the heaviest eigenstate\n(i.e., the state with the largest eigenvalue) of H\u0303\u03c9 \u2243 \u03bcD\u0303. For the NH case two spectral swaps/splits form hierarchically at \u03bc \u223c \u03c90\nand \u03bc \u223c \u03b1\u03c90 , respectively. Curves in the left-hand panels give \u03c1\u03c9 with various values of \u03c9. At \u03c90 \u226b \u03bc \u226b \u03b1\u03c90 the heaviest\neigenstate of H\u0303 \u2243 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9H,0 )BH + \u03bcD\u0303 is |\u03bd3 i for neutrinos with \u03c9 > \u03a9H,0 . Subsequently these neutrinos no longer participate\nin collective oscillations. At \u03bc \u226a \u03b1\u03c90 the remaining neutrinos are in |\u03bd2 i or |\u03bd1 i, depending on whether \u03c9L = \u03b1\u03c9 is larger\nor smaller than \u03a9L,0 . In either case the state corresponds to the heaviest eigenstate of H\u0303\u03c9 \u2243 (\u03c9L \u2212 \u03a9L,0 )BL (ignoring the\ndecoupled state |\u03bd3 i). This leads to two spectral swaps/splits in the final neutrino energy spectra (the thick lines in the NH\ncolumn in the right-hand panels). In the IH case, initially the \u03c133 are set to 0 for all \u03c9. As a result |\u03bd3 i is completely decoupled\nfrom the EoM and no spectral swap/split forms at \u03bc \u223c \u03c90 . The dotted lines in the right-hand panels are computed by using\nthe constancy of Tr(D * \u039b3 ) and Tr(D * \u039b8 ) and by assuming that the spectral swaps/splits are infinitely sharp.

This has sometimes been called \"kinematic decoherence\". Of course, this is not to be confused with\nquantum decoherence, which can be induced by any neutrino scattering process that changes neutrino momentum. In\na homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas the condition for the kinematic decoherence is \u2206\u03c9 \u226b \u03bc. In this limit the\n~ with vacuum\ncoupling among \"spins\" is not strong enough to maintain a collective motion and P~\u03c9 will precess about B\noscillation frequency \u03c9. In Section II C we have seen that, when \u2206\u03c9 \u226a \u03bc, synchronized neutrino oscillations do not\n~ is approximately constant because of energy conservation. Numerical simulations\ndecohere kinematically, and |D|\nsuggest that bipolar neutrino oscillations are also stable [53, 55], although as yet we know of no conservation law\nwhich could explain this.\nIf collective neutrino oscillations also exist in an anisotropic environment, then the wavefronts of the oscillation\nwaves of the neutrinos must coincide with one another. In the neutrino bulb model these wavefronts are spheres that\nco-center with the PNS. However, in this model a neutrino propagating along a non-radial trajectory would travel a\ndistance longer than that of a radially propagating neutrino [48]. In other words, a non-radially propagating neutrino\n\n\f14\nappears to have a larger oscillation frequency \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9/ cos \u03b8 along r (see Equation (12)). This will enlarge \u2206\u03c9 and\nwould require stronger neutrino self-coupling to maintain collective oscillations among neutrinos propagating along\n~ \u03bd\u03bd,\u03b8 (r) generated by other \"spins\" is trajectory dependent.\ndifferent trajectories. Note that the \"magnetic field\" H\nThis adds another potential source of kinematic decoherence.\nReference [70] pointed out that a neutrino gas with an initially symmetric bipolar configuration (i.e., P~\u03bd = \u2212P~\u03bd\u0304 )\ncan experience quick kinematic decoherence even in the presence of a small anisotropy, and in this case both |P~\u03bd | and\n|P~\u03bd\u0304 | evolve towards 0. Later it was found that an asymmetric bipolar neutrino system (i.e., |P~\u03bd | = (1 + \u03b5)|P~\u03bd\u0304 | with\n\u03b5 6= 0) may nor may not experience kinematic decoherence depending on the value of \u03b5 [73]. For typical choices of\nother parameters in a neutrino bulb model, kinematic decoherence is suppressed if \u03b5 & 0.3.\nIn the above discussion we have ignored ordinary matter. In the presence of a large matter density, P~\u03c9 tends to\n~ with frequency \u03c9 \u2032 = \u2212\u03bb + \u03c9 cos 2\u03b8v . In the isotropic environment \u03c9 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9 cos 2\u03b8v in the corotating\nprecess around \u2212L\n~ with frequency \u03bb. Therefore, in this case when neutrinos experience collective oscillations\nframe that rotates about L\nordinary matter can be ignored. In an anisotropic environment, such as the neutrino bulb model, we will have\nfrequency \u03c9 \u2032 = (\u2212\u03bb + \u03c9 cos 2\u03b8v )/ cos \u03b8 along r. Clearly, it is not possible to remove the matter effect for all neutrino\ntrajectories. This implies that collective neutrino oscillations would not exist in a region where the net number density\nof electrons is much larger than that of neutrinos [89].\nB.\n\nPrecession mode in the anisotropic environment\n\nIn Section III we have seen that with \u03b5 6= 0 the flavor pendulum possesses an internal spin. The existence of this\ninternal spin makes it possible for the flavor pendulum to experience simultaneously a precession motion and a nutation\nmotion. These two kinds of motion of the flavor pendulum correspond to the precession mode and the bipolar mode of\nneutrino oscillations. The findings in References [70] and [73] suggest that bipolar neutrino oscillations, which are the\nmost prominent when \u03b5 is small, becomes non-collective in the anisotropic environment. These findings also suggest\nthat the precession mode, which becomes important for cases with sufficiently large \u03b5, can remain collective in the\nanisotropic environment. This is partially confirmed by the fact that neutrino oscillations calculated in the single-angle\nscheme and in the multi-angle scheme possess common features, such as the spectral swap/split phenomenon. This\nphenomenon, as explained with the single-angle supernova scheme or in homogeneous and isotropic environments,\nresults from neutrino oscillations in the collective precession mode.\nThe EoM of the polarization vectors in a stationary environment can be written as [111, 113, 122]\n~ +H\n~ \u03bd\u03bd,p\u0302 (x)] \u00d7 P~\u03c9,p\u0302 (x),\np\u0302 * \u2207P~\u03c9,p\u0302 (x) = [\u03c9 B\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we have assumed \u03bb = 0 for now, all the polarization vectors are normalized by n\u03bd (x0 ), the number density of\nneutrino species \u03bd at location x0 , and\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u221a\n\u2032\n~\nH\u03bd\u03bd,p\u0302 (x) = 2GF n\u03bd (x0 )\nd\u03c9\nd2 p\u0302\u2032 (1 \u2212 p\u0302 * p\u0302\u2032 )P~\u03c9\u2032 ,p\u0302\u2032 (x).\n(26)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n~ If {P~\u03c9,p\u0302 (x)| \u2200\u03c9, p\u0302}\nLike the isotropic-neutrino-gas case, Equation (25) also exhibits rotational symmetry about B.\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~\n~\n~\nsolves the EoM, then {P\u03c9,p\u0302 (x)| \u2200\u03c9, p\u0302} also solves the EoM, where P\u03c9,p\u0302 (x) is obtained from P\u03c9,p\u0302 (x) by rotation about\n~ by an arbitrary angle \u03c6, and where \u03c6 is independent of \u03c9, p\u0302, and x.

These are shown in Figure 9. We will focus the following discussion on the\n\u2212\ntwo flavor mixing scenario with |\u2206m2 | \u2243 \u2206m2atm and \u03b8v \u2243 \u03b813 .

We note that for an iron core collapse supernova at early\n+\n\u2212\ntimes and in the NH case, Rcoll\n\u2264 Rcoll\n, meaning that the collective neutrino oscillation regime does not exist. At later\ntimes in these models a collective neutrino oscillation regime can appear when the matter density becomes relatively\nsmall. In contrast, collective neutrino oscillations can occur at early epochs in an O-Ne-Mg core collapse supernova.\nThis is because the progenitors of these supernovae have relatively lower masses (8\u201312M\u2299), and therefore, after core\nbounce, the PNS has a dilute, lower density envelope [123, 124].\n\u2212\nIn the IH case the value of Rcoll\nis the larger of the values extracted from the following two conditions:\n\u2206m2atm\n1\n\u2212\n\u221a\n)\u2243 \u221a\nn\u03bd\u0304e (Rcoll\n2\n( 1 + \u03b5 \u2212 1)\n2GF hE\u03bd\u0304e i\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n) \u2243 ne (Rcoll\n).\nand n\u03bd\u0304e (Rcoll\n\n(31)\n\n\f17\nThe first condition in Equation (31) is based on the flavor pendulum model (See Equation (17)) and the second\ncondition is in accord with the discussion in Section V A. In the very early epochs of an iron core collapse supernova,\nthe collective neutrino oscillation regime may not exist in the IH case because of the presence of a large matter density.\nB.\n\nEffects of collective neutrino oscillations\n\nThe supernova neutrino energy spectra can be dramatically modified by collective neutrino oscillations. Perhaps\nthe most prominent feature to arise from collective neutrino oscillations is the spectral swap/split. For example, see\nFigure 1 and its caption. Obtaining this feature can depend on supernova conditions. For example, the calculations\nused to produce Figure 1 would give no spectral swap/split if the matter density were too large [76, 89].\nWhen \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e are the most abundant neutrino species at the neutrino sphere, some qualitative aspects of collective\nneutrino oscillations in supernovae can be understood using the flavor pendulum model. In the IH case, the initial\nconfiguration of the flavor pendulum is near its highest position and is unstable when the neutrino flux is below\nsome critical value. (See the discussion in Section IV B.) This implies that collective neutrino oscillations and their\neffects on neutrino energy spectra are relatively insensitive to the matter density or the exact value of \u03b813 . In the\nNH case, however, the flavor pendulum would be near its stable configuration unless MSW flavor transformation\ndisplaces it from this position. As a result, collective neutrino oscillations and their effects depend on the efficiency\nof the \u03bd-enhanced MSW flavor transformation. In turn, the efficiency of this flavor transformation is sensitive to\nboth the matter profile and the value of \u03b813 . This general picture is confirmed by multi-angle calculations [75].\nThe results shown in Reference [75] suggest that it may be possible to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy with an\nobserved supernova neutrino signal, even if the absolute neutrino masses and/or \u03b813 are too small to be measured in\nthe laboratory.\nNeutrino signals detected at very early times after core bounce may be important probes of neutrino mixing. For\niron core collapse supernovae, the neutrino spectra at the very early times, are modified by the conventional MSW\nmechanism and can be easily calculated [125]. For O-Ne-Mg core collapse supernovae, however, the matter density is\nso low above the PNS that even at these very early times, where the \u03bde luminosity can be very large (\u223c 1053 erg/s),\ncollective neutrino oscillations can create step-like features (swaps/splits) in the observed neutrino energy spectra\n[78]. If these features are observed in a Galactic supernova neutrino burst, then they could serve as diagnostics of the\nneutrino mass hierarchy and, in the NH case, even provide a measure of \u03b813 .\nHowever, we note that the spectral swap/split phenomenon is sensitive to the neutrino luminosities and energy\nspectra at the neutrino sphere. Presently there are rather large uncertainties in these quantities, especially for the\nlate-time supernova environment. We also note that very large neutrino fluxes do not necessarily imply a large\n\u2212\nneutrino oscillation effect. In fact, in the IH case a larger neutrino luminosity pushes Rcoll\nto a larger radius.\nOf course, collective neutrino oscillations are not the only way that neutrinos may experience flavor transformation in\nsupernovae. As in the Sun, in supernovae neutrinos also can experience the conventional MSW flavor transformation.\nHowever, the matter profile in supernovae may not be smooth (e.g., because of shocks or turbulence) near MSW\nresonance regions. This can produce some interesting phenomena [99, 126\u2013132].\nIn principle, the alteration of supernova neutrino energy spectra by collective neutrino oscillations and/or other\nprocesses of neutrino flavor transformation could affect supernova dynamics, shock reheating, and nucleosynthesis in\nneutrino-heated ejecta [39, 46, 48, 106, 133]. However, modeling of this physics in realistic supernova conditions is at\npresent primitive.\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY AND OPEN ISSUES\n\nIn this review we have discussed collective neutrino oscillations in a simple bipolar neutrino system, in homogeneous\nand isotropic neutrino gases, and in anisotropic neutrino gases. The simple bipolar neutrino system (described by the\nflavor pendulum) is the simplest of these and is solvable analytically. It can be used to understand many qualitative\nfeatures of collective neutrino oscillations in supernovae. The single-angle scheme essentially treats supernova neutrinos\nas a homogeneous and isotropic gas, and adiabatic neutrino flavor transformation in such a gas can be used to\nunderstand the spectral swap/split phenomenon in the supernova environment. An anisotropic neutrino gas can\npossess unique characteristics (e.g., suppression of collective flavor oscillations by large matter density). This makes it\nan important target for study because realistic physical environments such as core collapse supernovae can be highly\nanisotropic.\nWe have covered some of the basic properties of collective neutrino oscillations, with emphasis on the two-flavor\nmixing case. There is much about the collective neutrino oscillation phenomenon which remains to be understood.\n\n\f18\n\nAntineutrinos\n\n0\n\n10\n\nNeutrinos\n\n20\n30\n40\nEnergy [MeV]\n\nIH\n\nIH\n\nNH\n\nNH\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n40\nEnergy [MeV]\n\n50\n\nFIG. 10: Multiple spectral swaps/splits in a two-flavor single-angle calculation with |\u2206m2 | \u2243 \u2206m2atm and \u03b8v \u226a 1.

Adiabaticity criteria developed so far [77] are difficult to use in practice.\nThere are other open issues in our current understanding of collective neutrino oscillations in supernovae. For\nexample, it was recently shown that there can exist multiple spectral swaps/splits in the final neutrino energy spectra\n[76, 101, 103] (Figure 10). The appearance of these features depend on, however, the luminosities and energy spectra of\nthe different neutrino species at the neutrino sphere. This finding cannot be explained by a grand collective precession\nmode in which all neutrinos and antineutrinos participate. In an even more recent paper [108] it was reported that\nqualitatively different results could appear in some collective neutrino oscillation scenarios depending on whether twoflavor mixing or full three-flavor mixing is used. All of these discoveries point up the need for a systematic study of\nsupernova neutrino oscillations with neutrino self-interaction and full three-flavor mixing at various supernova epochs\nwhere neutrino luminosities and energy spectra can be different. In addition, numerical simulations of supernova\nexplosions have shown clearly that realistic supernova environments may be highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous\n[28, 30\u201335, 134]. It would be interesting to see how density inhomogeneities arising from, e.g., shock waves and\nturbulence might affect collective neutrino oscillations. It remains a towering numerical challenge to integrate fully\nhydrodynamic, three-dimensional supernova models with calculations of neutrino oscillations that include neutrino\nself-interaction. However, such self-consistent integration may be necessary in order to study the interplay between\nsupernova physics and neutrino oscillations. In particular, a full understanding of neutrino oscillations in supernovae\nmay hold the key to deciphering the neutrino signal from a future Galactic supernova. The stakes are high. Deciphering\na supernova neutrino signal could provide important insights into supernova astrophysics. It also could provide key\ninsights into fundamental neutrino properties and these insights could be complementary to those sought by future\nneutrino experiments.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank J.
