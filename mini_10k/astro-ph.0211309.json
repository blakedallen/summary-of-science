We briefly discuss the perspectives of sensitive hard X\u2013ray observations with the large collecting area\nX\u2013ray telescopes of XEUS.\n\n1. Introduction\nThanks to the excellent performances of the new generation of X\u2013ray satellites both in terms of spatial resolution\n(Chandra) and high energy throughput (XMM\u2013Newton) it has been possible to perform the deepest X\u2013ray observations\nand almost completely resolve the 0.5\u20138 keV X\u2013ray background (XRB) into single sources (Brandt et al. 2001; Giacconi\net al. 2002). Although at the flux limits reached by deep Chandra surveys a large variety of sources has been detected,\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provide the most important contribution to the overall energy budget of the hard\nXRB. The increasing observational evidence of a large population of obscured sources support the prediction of AGN\nsynthesis models for the X\u2013ray background (Setti & Woltjer 1989; Comastri et al. 1995; Gilli et al. 2001). At this stage\nit seems obvious to conclude that there would be no other deep X\u2013ray surveys if the origin of the XRB is considered\na closed issue.\nIn the following we try to outline a few topics which would greatly benefit from further observations with a large\ncollecting area X\u2013ray facility such as XEUS.\n2. The content of hard X\u2013ray surveys\nThe overall status of optical follow\u2013up observations of X\u2013ray sources is usually summarized by plots of the R\u2013band\nmagnitude versus the 2\u201310 keV X\u2013ray flux (Figure 1). The range of X\u2013ray to optical flux ratios of spectroscopically\nidentified AGN is marked with the shaded area within \u20131 < log(fX /fopt ) < 1 (Maccacaro et al. 1988). This trend holds\nfor a large number of sources over a broad range of fluxes. Attention should be paid to those sources which deviate\nfrom log(fX /fopt ) = 0 \u00b1 1. The objects characterized by high values of fX /fopt are optically faint, sometimes below the\nlimits of deep optical images. The spectroscopic identification of these objects is already challenging the capabilities of\n8\u201310 m ground based telescopes. Although obscured accretion seems to provide the most likely explanation for their\nX\u2013ray to optical flux ratios distribution (Comastri, Brusa & Mignoli 2002) the observed properties are also consistent\nwith those expected for high redshift (possibly even z > 6) quasars and cluster of galaxies at z > 1 .\nA not negligible number of X\u2013ray sources have optical counterparts which are brighter than expected for AGN and\nlie below log(fX /fopt ) = \u22121. The identification breakdown suggests that these objects are fairly normal galaxies and\nthe X\u2013ray emission is powered by processes associated with star formation, even though obscured accretion might be\nresponsible of the peculiar broad band properties of a few of them (Comastri et al. 2002a).\n3. Selected outliers in the fX /fopt plane\nFor the purposes of the present discussion we have selected three different classes of hard X\u2013ray selected sources\nwhich, in our opinion, deserve further investigation and would greatly benefit from deeper X\u2013ray observations. An\nexpanded view of their X\u2013ray and optical fluxes is reported in Figure 2. The red asterisks in the upper part of the\ndiagram correspond to extremely red objects (EROs), the cyan squares around logfX /fopt \u2243 \u22121 are X\u2013ray Bright\nOptically Normal Galaxies (aka XBONG; Comastri et al. 2002b), while the black circles in the lower left part are\nspectroscopically confirmed starburst galaxies.\n\n\f2\n\nA.

From top left: the\nHELLAS2XMM survey (Baldi et al. 2002), the XMM survey in the Lockman Hole (Mainieri et al. 2002); the ELAIS\ndeep Chandra survey (Manners et al. 2002), the combination of a few medium deep Chandra surveys (Barger et al.\n2001), The Chandra Deep Field South (Giacconi et al. 2002) and the Chandra Hubble Deep Field North (Brandt et al.\n2001). The upper (lower) solid line corresponds to logfX /fopt =1 (\u20131). The shaded area represents the region occupied\nby conventional AGN (e.g. quasars, Seyferts, emission line galaxies).\n\n3.1. Extremely Red Objects\nThe bulk of the overall energy output of Extremely Red Objects (R\u2013K > 5 or I\u2013K > 4) is, almost by definition,\nin the near\u2013infrared band. The red colors are consistent with those expected for passively evolving galaxies, dust\u2013\nenshrouded starburst galaxies or reddened AGN at z \u2243 1. Recent Chandra and XMM\u2013Newton hard X\u2013ray observations\n(Alexander et al. 2002a, Brusa et al. 2002a, Vignali et al. 2002) have proven to be very powerful in disentangling the\nvarious possibilities. The properties of X\u2013ray detected EROs are consistent with those of high redshift, luminous,\nobscured AGN. Therefore, hard X\u2013ray selected EROs have the properties of the so far elusive population of type 2\nquasars predicted by the synthesis models and responsible for the energetically dominant component of the XRB.\n\n\fA. Comastri, P. Ranalli & M. Brusa: Beyond the X\u2013ray background with XEUS\n\n3\n\nStacking analysis of those objects which are not individually detected suggests that, on average, star\u2013forming systems\nare more luminous X\u2013ray sources than passively evolving galaxies (Brusa et al. 2002b).\n3.2. X-ray bright optically normal galaxies\nThe excellent spatial resolution of the Chandra detectors allowed to unambiguosly identify an intriguing new class of X\u2013\nray sources (Hornschemeier et al. 2001, Barger et al. 2002). They are found at moderately low redshift (z < 1) and are\ncharacterized by an absorption dominated optical spectrum and AGN\u2013like hard X\u2013ray luminosities (L2\u221210 \u2243 1042\u221243\nerg s\u22121 ). The average value of their log(fX /fopt ) distribution is around \u22121 with a large dispersion (Fig. 2). An attempt\nto investigate their nature through a multiwavelength approach suggests that the putative AGN responsible for the\nhard X\u2013ray emission is completely hidden at longer wavelengths (Comastri et al. 2002b). It has been also suggested\nthat the observed broad band properties can be explained by the presence of an heavily obscured (NH > 1025 cm\u22122 )\nCompton thick AGN (Comastri, Brusa and Mignoli 2002).\n3.3. The hard X\u2013ray luminosity and the star formation rate\nIt is well known that the radio and far\u2013infrared luminosities of star\u2013forming galaxies follow a tight linear relation.\nMaking use of a sample of nearby star\u2013forming galaxies observed by ASCA and BeppoSAX it has been shown that\na linear relation holds also between the X\u2013ray and both the radio and far\u2013infrared bands (Ranalli, Comastri & Setti\n2002). Such a relation has been extended to z \u22431 combining the 1 Ms Chandra Deep Field North exposures with deep\n15\u03bcm ISOCAM (Alexander et al. 2002b) and 1.4 GHz VLA observations (Bauer et al. 2002) and up to z \u2243 3 via stacking\nanalysis of Lyman break galaxies (Nandra et al. 2002). These results imply that the hard X\u2013ray emission can be used\nas an absorption independent indicator of the star formation rate.\nMoreover it is possible to compute the expected X\u2013ray counts of star\u2013forming galaxies from the LogN \u2013LogS measured\nin deep radio surveys (Fig. 3). The number counts of star\u2013forming galaxies begin to overcome AGN counts at fluxes\nof the order of 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Interesting enough the predictions are fully consistent with the constraints from\nfluctuation analysis in deep Chandra fields (Miyaji & Griffiths 2002) and with the number counts expected by the\nX\u2013ray binaries resulting from the peak in the cosmic star formation rate at z >1 (Ptak et al. 2001).\n4. Perspectives for XEUS deep fields\nThe foreseen XEUS capabilities in terms of collecting area will allow to obtain (with exposure times ranging from 100\nks to 1 Ms) good quality X\u2013ray spectra for almost all the X\u2013ray sources discovered in the deepest Chandra and XMM\u2013\nNewton surveys. Given that most of these sources are likely to be the obscured AGN responsible for the bulk of the\nhard X\u2013ray background, it will be possible to completely characterize the cosmic history of accretion powered sources.\nIt is also worth noticing that the detection of iron K\u03b1 features could provide the only method (besides spectroscopy\nwith 30\u2013100 m optical telescopes and the photometric technique) to obtain a redshift estimate for those sources with\nextremely faint optical counterparts. The detection of X\u2013ray sources will be pushed down to limiting fluxes of the\norder of a few 10\u221218 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . At this level starburst galaxies will be detected in the X\u2013ray band to at least\nz \u22433, allowing to obtain an independent constraint on the cosmic star formation history to be compared with those\nobtained at longer wavelengths, and to investigate the connection with the onset and fueling of massive black holes.\nAcknowledgements.

The blue triangles represent the results of stacking analysis of those EROs associated with dusty\nstar\u2013forming system (the detection) and passively evolving old galaxies (the upper limit).\nComastri, A., Mignoli, M., Ciliegi, P., et al., 2002a, ApJ 571, 771\nComastri, A., Brusa, M., Ciliegi, P., et al., 2002b, in proceedings of \"New Visions of the X-ray Universe in the XMM-Newton\nand Chandra Era\" , 26-30 November 2001, ESTEC, The Netherlands (astro\u2013ph/0203019)\nComastri, A., Brusa, M., & Mignoli, M., 2002, proceeding of the workshop \"X-ray surveys, on the light of the new observatories\"\nSantander, September 2002, AN 324, in press\nFomalont, E.B., et al., 1991, AJ, 102, 1258\nGiacconi, R., et al., 2002, ApJS, 139, 369\nGilli, R., Salvati, M., & Hasinger, G., 2001, A&A, 366, 407\nHornschemeier, A.E., Brandt, W.N., Garmire, G.P., et al., 2001, ApJ, 554, 742\nMaccacaro, T., Gioia, I.M., Wolter, A., Zamorani, G., Stocke, J.T.: 1988, ApJ 326, 680\nMainieri, V., et al. 2002, A&A, 393, 425\nManners, J.C., et al., 2002, MNRAS submitted (astro\u2013ph/0207622)\nMiyaji, T., & Griffiths, R.E., 2002, ApJ, 564, L5\n\n\fA.
