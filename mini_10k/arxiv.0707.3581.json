An entangled quantum state may generate measurement statistics that are inherently different from those generated\nby a classical process [1, 2]. This feature of entanglement is referred to as the nonlocality of quantum states.\nDual to the notion of state nonlocality is the nonlocality\nof quantum operations. A natural definition of a local\nquantum operation on a multi-partite quantum system\nis that of Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) protocols, in which each party may apply\nto his system arbitrary quantum operations, while the\ninter-partite communication must be classical. It follows\nfrom the definition that no LOCC protocol creates quantum entanglement. However, the reverse is false. This\nsurprising fact was discovered by Bennett et al. [3] and\nwas formulated as a problem of reliably distinguishing\nquantum states.\nA set of state E = {|\u03c6i iAB }i is said to be reliably distinguishable by a quantum operation T if on each |\u03c6i iAB ,\nT outputs i with probability 1. The authors of [3] identified an orthonormal basis B9 for C3 \u00d7 C3 , illustrated in\nFig. 1, that cannot be reliably distinguished by LOCC.\nThe important feature of the basis is that each base vector is a product state, thus the distinguishing operator\ncannot create entanglement.\nThe above property of nonlocal operations not necessarily creating entanglement is referred to as \"nonlocality without entanglement\", and has been studied by\nmany authors subsequently [3\u201315]. Formally, an orthogonal product set (OPS) is a set of bipartite states which\nare product states and are pairwise orthogonal. An OPS\nthat forms a basis is also called an orthogonal product\nbasis (OPB). Much effort has been devoted to searching\nfor additional LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs. Besides\ndef\nB9 , Ref. [3] actually showed that B8 = B9 \u2212 {|1i|1i}\nis not LOCC-distinguishable, either.

An unextendable product basis\n(UPB) is an OPS that is not a proper subset of any other\nOPS.\nNote that a UPB is not necessarily a basis for the\nunderlying product space. If E is an OPS in a product space HA \u2297 HB , denote by EA = {|\u03b1i \u2208 HA :\n\u2203|\u03b2i \u2208 HB , |\u03b1i|\u03b2i \u2208 E}, and EB = {|\u03b2i \u2208 HB : \u2203|\u03b1i \u2208\nHA , |\u03b1i|\u03b2i \u2208 E}.\nDefinition 2 ([9]). An OPS E is irreducible if neither EA\nnor EB can be partitioned into two nonempty orthogonal\nsubsets.\nTheorem 3 ([4, 5, 9]). The following OPSs are\nLOCC-indistinguishable:\n(1) An irreducible OPB ([9]).\n(2) A UPB ([4, 5]).\nIn fact,\nRef. [9]\nindistinguishable OPBs.\n\ncharacterizes\n\nall\n\nLOCC-\n\nTheorem 4 ([9]). An OPB cannot be reliably distinguished by LOCC if and only if it contains an irreducible\n\n\f2\nsubset that spans a product space. In particular, an OPB\nin 3 \u2297 3 space is LOCC-indistinguishable if and only if it\nis irreducible.\nA main objective of this line of research is to\nidentify additional LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs. To\nthis end, we generalize B8 to a broader class of\nLOCC-indistinguishable OPSs having a similar structure. A satisfactory understanding of LOCC indistinguishability is a complete and computationally verifiable\ncharacterization of all such OPSs. Clearly, any OPS in\na 1 \u2297 n system, n \u2265 1, is LOCC-distinguishable. It is\nalso known [3] that the same is true for any 2 \u2297 n system, n \u2265 1. Thus 3 \u2297 3 is the smallest dimension where\nsuch a characterization is not known. The main result\nof this Letter resolves this problem. We show that when\nrestricted to the 3 \u2297 3 space, the generalizations of B8 ,\ntogether with irreducible OPBs and UPBs, are the only\npossible LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs. A key step in\nthe proof of our characterization is to show that all irreducible OPBs in the 3 \u2297 3 space must have a representation by rectangles similar to that of B9 .\nWe introduce some notions for the rest of the paper.\nBy a slight abuse of notation, for two vectors |\u03b1i and |\u03b2i,\nwe write |\u03b1i = |\u03b2i if there exists a non-zero c \u2208 C such\nthat |\u03b1i = c|\u03b2i.\nDefinition 5. Two product states |\u03b1i|\u03b2i and |\u03b1\u2032 i|\u03b2 \u2032 i are\nsaid to align on the left (right) if |\u03b1i = |\u03b1\u2032 i (|\u03b2i = |\u03b2 \u2032 i).\nLet m, n \u2265 1 be integers. If E is an OPS in the m \u2297 n\ndimensional space and |E| = mn \u2212 1, then E can be extended to an OPB [5]. Denote by E \u22a5 the unique product\nstate that extends E to a basis.\nTheorem 6. Let m, n \u2265 1 be integers. An OPS described\nbelow is LOCC-indistinguishable.\n(3) An irreducible OPS E in Cm \u2297 Cn with |E| = mn \u2212 1\nsuch that E \u22a5 does not align on either side with any\nelement in E.\nProof. Denote by HA and HB the state space of Alice\nand and Bob, respectively. Suppose E = {|\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i : 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 mn \u2212 1} and E \u22a5 = |\u03b10 i|\u03b20 i. Suppose that E can be\nreliably distinguished by an LOCC protocol. Fix such a\nprotocol P that takes the smallest number of rounds of\ncommunication. Without loss of generality, assume that\nAlice sends the first message, which is the measurement\noutcome k of a Positive-Operator-Valued Measurement\ndef\n\u2032\n\u2032\nis Alice's\n}k , where HA\n(POVM) M = {Mk : HA \u2192 HA\nstatePspace after applying M and the operators Mk satisfy k Mk\u2020 Mk = IHA . If for each k, there exists \u03bck > 0\nP\nsuch that Mk\u2020 Mk = \u03bck IHA , then k \u03bck = 1 and each Mk\nis an isometric embedding. Thus M can be implemented\nby having Bob send the message instead: he generates a\nrandom number k with probability \u03bck , sends it to Alice,\nwho applies Mk to HA . This contradicts the assumption\n\nthat P takes the smallest number of rounds. Therefore,\nthere exists a k such that Mk\u2020 Mk has k0 \u2265 2 number\nof distinct eigenvalues. Fix such a k for the rest of the\nproof.\nSince the post-measurement states must remain orthogonal so that they can be reliably distinguished by\nthe remaining steps of P, we have h\u03b1i |h\u03b2i |(Mk\u2020 Mk \u2297\nIHB )|\u03b1j i|\u03b2j i = 0, for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 mn \u2212 1. Note that\ndef\n\nE \u2032 = E \u222a{E \u22a5 } is an OPB, thus for each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 mn\u22121,\nthere exist \u03bbi , \u03bb0i \u2208 C, such that Mk\u2020 Mk \u2297 IB |\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i =\n\u03bbi |\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i + \u03bb0i |\u03b10 i|\u03b20 i. Applying h\u03b10 | on both sides, we\nhave h\u03b10 |Mk\u2020 Mk |\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i = \u03bbi h\u03b10 |\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i + \u03bb0i |\u03b20 i. It follows that \u03bb0i = 0, since |\u03b2i i 6= |\u03b20 i. Therefore, EA is a\nset of eigenstates of Mk\u2020 Mk .\nIf EA does not span HA , let |\u03b1i \u2208 HA be a state orthogonal to span(EA ). Let |\u03b2i \u2208 HB be orthogonal to |\u03b20 i.\nSuch |\u03b2i must exist since otherwise dim(HB ) = 1, and\nE would be reducible. Then |\u03b1i|\u03b2i is orthogonal to E \u2032 , a\ncontradiction to E \u2032 being a basis for HA \u2297 HB . Therefore, EA spans HA , and is a complete spectrum of Mk\u2020 Mk .\nIt follows that EA can be partitioned into k0 number of\npair-wise orthogonal subsets, each of which corresponds\nto a distinct eigenvalue of Mk\u2020 Mk . Since k0 \u2265 2, this contradicts the assumption that E is irreducible. Therefore,\nE is LOCC-indistinguishable.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nAs mentioned above, the 3 \u2297 3 space is the smallest\nspace having LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs. We also\nknow the following useful facts.\nProposition 7 ([5]). An OPS E in C3 \u2297 C3 is LOCCdistinguishable if |E| \u2264 4.\nTheorem 8 ([4, 5]). Any UPB in C3 \u2297 C3 must have\nexactly 5 elements.\nIn what follows, we completely characterize all LOCCindistinguishable OPSs in the 3 \u2297 3 space.\nTheorem 9 (Main Theorem). An OPS in C3 \u2297 C3 is\nLOCC-indistinguishable if and only if it belongs to one\nof the three classes (1), (2), and (3).\nCombining the above three results, an LOCCindistinguishable OPS in the 3 \u2297 3 space must have precisely 5, 8, or 9 elements, each of which corresponds to belong to the classes (2), (3) and (1), respectively. Whether\nor not an OPS is irreducible can be checked from the the\npairwise inner products of the state components. The\nsame information can be used to determine if an OPS is\nan UPB in the 3 \u2297 3 space [4, 5]. Therefore, whether or\nnot an OPS belongs to (1), (2), or (3) can be determined\ncomputationally.\nTo prove Main Theorem, we first generalize the rectangular representation for B9 and derive some useful properties of the generalization. Let I and J be two sets. A\nsubset R \u2286 I \u00d7 J is a rectangle if R = A \u00d7 B for some\n\n\f3\ndef\n\nA \u2286 I and B \u2286 J. If R = A \u00d7 B, denote by I(R) = A\ndef\nand J(R) = B. A rectangular decomposition of I \u00d7 J\nis a partition of I \u00d7 J into rectangles. Fig. 1 illustrates\na rectangular decomposition for {0, 1, 2} \u00d7 {0, 1, 2}. We\nrefer to this decomposition as R9 and use the labeling\nscheme in the Figure for its elements.\ndef\n\nDefinition 10. Let m, n \u2265 1 be integers, I =\ndef\n{0, 1, * * * , n \u2212 1}, and J = {0, 1, * * * , m \u2212 1}. Let E be\nan OPB of a product space HA \u2297 HB with dim(HA ) = n\nand dim(HB ) = m. A rectangular representation of E is\na quintuple (R, \u03b1, \u03b2, U, V ) such that:\n(a) R is a rectangular decomposition of I \u00d7 J.\n(b) \u03b1 = {|\u03b10 i, |\u03b11 i, * * * , |\u03b1n\u22121 i} is an orthonormal basis\nfor HA , and similarly, \u03b2 = {|\u03b20 i, |\u03b21 i, * * * , |\u03b2m\u22121 i} is\nan orthonormal basis for HB .\n\n(c) U assigns each R \u2208 R a unitary operator UR on\nspan{|\u03b1i i : i \u2208 I(R)}, and similarly, VR is a unitary\noperator on span{|\u03b2j i : j \u2208 J(R)}.\n(d) E = {(UR |\u03b1i i) \u2297 (VR |\u03b2j i) : R \u2208 R, (i, j) \u2208 R}.\nIt can be verified by direct inspection from Fig. 1 that\nB9 has a rectangular representation of which the rectangular decomposition is R9 and the unitary transformations are either Identity operators or Hadamard. Removing any state other than |1i|1i from B9 results in an\nLOCC-distinguishable set. The same is true for any OPB\nhaving a rectangular representation using R9 .\nProposition 11. Let E be an OPB in the 3\u22973 space having a rectangular representation (R9 , \u03b1, \u03b2, U, V ). Suppose |\u03b11 i|\u03b21 i \u2208 B is the state corresponding to the 1 \u00d7 1\nrectangle. Then any OPS obtained from E by removing\nsome state other than |\u03b11 i|\u03b21 i is LOCC-distinguishable.\nProof. We denote the states in E by {|\u03c6i i : 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 9} using the labeling scheme in Fig. 1. Without loss of generality, assume that |\u03c61 i is the only\nstate in E missing in E \u2032 . By direct inspection, the\nfollowing LOCC protocol identifies an unknown input\nstate from E \u2032 . Bob starts the protocol by measuring {|\u03b20 ih\u03b20 |, I \u2212 |\u03b20 ih\u03b20 |}. If the measurement outcome\ncorresponds to the first operator, Alice\no measures\nn\n\u2020\n\u2020\n|\u03b10 ih\u03b10 |, UR4 |\u03b11 ih\u03b11 |UR4 , UR4 |\u03b12 ih\u03b12 |UR4 , concluding that the input state is |\u03c62 i, |\u03c67 i, or |\u03c68 i accordingly.\nIn the other case, the protocol continues using a similar\nstrategy.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe now present our Main Lemma, which characterizes\nirreducible OPBs (thus LOCC-indistinguishable OPBs)\nin terms of rectangular representations.\nLemma 12 (Main Lemma). Any irreducible OPB in the\n3 \u2297 3 space has a rectangular representation using R9 .\n\nProof. Let E = {|\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 9} be\nan irreducible OPB in the 3 \u2297 3 space HA \u2297\nHB .\nIf |\u03b1i i = |\u03b1j i, denote the state by |\u03b1i,j i.\nWe will construct a rectangular representation P =\n(R9 , {|0iA , |1iA , |2iA }, {|0iB , |1iB , |2iB }, U, V ) for E.\nWe first note that there exist two states |\u03b11 i|\u03b21 i and\n|\u03b12 i|\u03b22 i \u2208 E that are aligned in at least one side. (In fact,\nwe can prove that in the 3 \u2297 3 space, there are at most\n5 orthogonal product states such that no pair of them\nalign on either side.) Assume that |\u03b11 i = |\u03b12 i = |\u03b11,2 i;\nthe other case would lead to the same conclusion. Then\n|\u03b21 i \u22a5 |\u03b22 i. If there are 6 states whose component\nin HA is orthogonal to |\u03b11,2 i, then they must span\n(span{|\u03b11,2 i})\u22a5 \u2297HB , contradicting the assumption that\nE is irreducible. Thus there are |\u03b13 i, |\u03b14 i \u2208 EA with\nh\u03b11,2 |\u03b13 i 6= 0 and h\u03b11,2 |\u03b14 i 6= 0. This implies |\u03b23 i = |\u03b24 i.\nRepeating the above argument, we find in E pairs of\nstates {|\u03b15,6 i|\u03b25 i, |\u03b15,6 i|\u03b26 i} and {|\u03b17 i|\u03b27,8 i, |\u03b18 i|\u03b27,8 i}.\nBy direct inspection, |\u03b1i i|\u03b2i i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 8, must be distinct.\nDenote the remaining state in E by |\u03b19 i|\u03b29 i.\ndef\n\nWe show that\nLet SA = {|\u03b11,2 i, |\u03b19 i, |\u03b15,6 i}.\nSA is an orthonormal basis for HA .\nIf |\u03b29 i =\n|\u03b23,4 i, {|\u03b13 i|\u03b23,4 i, |\u03b14 i|\u03b23,4 i, |\u03b19 i|\u03b29 i} would span HA \u2297\nspan{|\u03b23,4 i}, contradicting E being irreducible. Thus\n|\u03b29 i 6= |\u03b23,4 i, implying that for some i \u2208 {1, 2}, h\u03b2i |\u03b29 i 6=\n0. Thus |\u03b19 i \u22a5 |\u03b11,2 i. Similarly, |\u03b19 i \u22a5 |\u03b15,6 i. If\n|\u03b11,2 i 6\u22a5 |\u03b15,6 i, {|\u03b2i i : i = 1, 2, 5, 6} would be mutually orthogonal, contradicting dim(HB ) = 3. Thus\n|\u03b11,2 i \u22a5 |\u03b15,6 i. Therefore, SA is an orthonormal basis\ndef\n\nfor HA . Similarly, SB = {|\u03b27,8 i, |\u03b29 i, |\u03b23,4 i} is orthonormal in HB . Relabel SA as {|iiA : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2} and SB as\n{|jiB : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2} such that |0iA = |\u03b11,2 i, |0iB = |\u03b27,8 i,\netc.\nDefine the following unitaries as the Identity operator on the corresponding dimension 1 space: UR1 , VR2 ,\ndef\n\nUR3 , VR4 , UR5 , and VR5 . Define VR1 = |\u03b21 ih0| + |\u03b22 ih1|,\ndef\n\ndef\n\nUR2 = |\u03b13 ih0| + |\u03b14 ih1|, VR3 = |\u03b25 ih1| + |\u03b26 ih2|, and\ndef\nUR4 = |\u03b17 ih1|+|\u03b18 ih2|. This completes the construction\nof P . By direct inspection, P is a rectangular representation of E.\n\u2293\n\u2294\nWe are now ready to prove Main Theorem.\nProof of Theorem 9. Since the \"if\" direction is precisely\nthe combination of Theorems 3 and 6, we need only to\nprove the \"only if\" direction. Suppose there exists an\nLOCC-indistinguishable OPS E in the 3 \u2297 3 space not\nbelonging to any of (1), (2), and (3). Then by Proposition 7, Theorems 4 and 8, 5 \u2264 |E| \u2264 8 and E is extensible\nto an OPB E \u2032 . Since E \u2032 must be LOCC-indistinguishable\n(and thus irreducible), it has a rectangular representation using R9 , by Lemma 12. Since E does not belong to\nClass (3), there exists a state |\u03b1i|\u03b2i in E \u2032 \u2212 E not contained in the rectangle R5 . Thus E \u2032 \u2212 {|\u03b1i|\u03b2i} is LOCCdistinguishable, by Proposition 11. So must be E, which\n\n\f4\nis a contradiction. Thus any LOCC-indistinguishable\nOPS must belong to (1), (2), or (3).\n\u2293\n\u2294\nOur method can also be used to give an alternative\nproof for the fact that there is no LOCC-indistinguishable\nOPSs in 2 \u2297 n spaces observed in Ref. [3]. It remains an\nopen problem to extend our result to the complete collection of LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs in spaces of a\ndimension higher than 3 \u2297 3. To this end, it may be\ndifficult to extend our technique as the rectangular representation lemma is not true for all dimensions. For\nexample, for any \u03b8, 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 and \u03b8 6= \u03c0/4, one can\nshow that the following OPB in the 2 \u2297 4 dimensional\nspace does not have a rectangular representation:\n|\u03c81,2 i\n|\u03c83,4 i\n|\u03c85,6 i\n|\u03c87,8 i\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n|0i \u2297 |0 \u00b1 1i,\n|1i \u2297 (cos \u03b8|0i \u00b1 sin \u03b8|1i),\n|0 + 1i \u2297 |2 \u00b1 3i,\n|0 \u2212 1i \u2297 (cos \u03b8|2i \u00b1 sin \u03b8|3i).\n\nOne may generalize the notion of rectangular representations through a recursive definition. Unfortunately, there\nalso exist OPBs that do not admit such a generalized\nrectangular representation. We note that an even more\ngeneral concept is that of unwindability, defined by DiVincenzo and Terhal [16]. Therefore, a deeper understanding of unwindable OPSs may lead to a better understanding of LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs in higher\ndimensions.\nOur result can be interpreted as an indication that\nLOCC protocols are quite powerful. Along this line, Walgate et al. [11] proved that LOCC is sufficient to reliably\ndistinguish two multi-partite orthogonal pure states, even\nwhen they are entangled. When the two states are not\northogonal, LOCC protocols can reach the global optimality in either conclusive discrimination [14] or inconclusive but unambiguous discrimination [15]. Therefore,\nperhaps the whole class of LOCC-indistinguishable OPSs\nhas much simpler structure than one may fear.\nThere are bipartite operators other than those distinguishing OPSs that do not create entanglement. Thus it\nremains an open problem to characterize all such operators that cannot be realized by LOCC, even in the 3 \u2297 3\ndimension case.\nWe observe that if an OPB has a rectangular representation (R, \u03b1, \u03b2, U, V ), then there is a simple LOCC\nprotocol to identify an unknown state given two copies\nof it: the first copy is projected to the bases \u03b1 and \u03b2\nso that the rectangle R containing the state is identified,\nthen the second copy is measured in the product basis\n{UR |\u03b1i i \u2297 VR |\u03b2j i : (i, j) \u2208 R}. Given an OPS, determining the number of copies of an unknown state necessary to admit an LOCC distinguishing protocol is an\ninteresting generalization of determining if it is LOCCdistinguishable.\nAnother interesting generalization is to determine the\noptimal probability of identifying an unknown state from\n\na given OPS by LOCC. Finally, it remains possible that\nan operator cannot be realized by LOCC yet may be\napproximated to an arbitrary precision. Identifying such\nan operator or proving that none exists is a fascinating\nopen problem.\nWe thank Runyao Duan and Zhengwei Zhou for discussions, and for pointing out related works. Y.
