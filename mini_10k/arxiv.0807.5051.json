Their major outcome consists in delaying the\nunitarity violation of vector boson scattering (VBS) amplitudes to higher energies compared\nto the answer of the Standard Model (SM) without a light Higgs, via the exchange of KaluzaKlein (KK) excitations [10]. The discretization of the compact fifth dimension to a lattice\ngenerates the so-called deconstructed theories which are chiral lagrangians with a number\nof replicas of the gauge group equal to the number of lattice sites [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n17, 18, 19]. Models have been proposed, assuming a SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L gauge\ngroup in the 5D bulk, [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9], in the framework suggested by the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, or also with a simpler gauge group SU(2) in the bulk [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\nThe drawback of all these models, as with technicolor theories, is to reconcile the presence\nof a relatively low KK-spectrum, necessary to delay the unitarity violation to TeV-energies,\nwith the electroweak precision tests (EWPT) whose measurements can be expressed in terms\nof the \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 and \u01eb3 (or T, U, S) parameters. More in detail, while \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are protected by\n\n\f2\nthe custodial symmetry [25, 26, 27, 28], shared by both the aforementioned classes of models,\nthe \u01eb3 (S) parameter constitutes the real obstacle to EWPT consistency. This problem can\nbe solved by either delocalizing fermions along the fifth dimension [7, 29] or, equivalently\nin the deconstructed version of the model, by allowing for direct couplings between new\nvector bosons and SM fermions [30]. In the simplest version of this latter class of models,\ncorresponding to just three lattice sites and gauge symmetry SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)Y (the\nso-called BESS model [31, 32]), the requirement of vanishing of the \u01eb3 parameter implies\nthat the new triplet of vector bosons is almost fermiophobic. As a consequence, the only\nproduction channels where the new gauge bosons can be searched for are those driven by\nboson-boson couplings. The Higgsless literature has been thus mostly focused on difficult\nmulti-particle processes which require high luminosity to be detected, that is vector boson\nfusion (VBF) and associated production of new gauge bosons with SM ones [33, 34, 35].\nWe extend the minimal three site model by inserting an additional lattice site. This\nnew four site Higgsless model, based on the SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)1 \u00d7 SU(2)2 \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge\n\n\u00b1\nsymmetry, predicts two neutral and four charged extra gauge bosons, Z1,2 and W1,2\n, and\n\nsatisfies the EWPT constraints without necessarily having fermiophobic resonances. Within\nthis framework, the more promising Drell-Yan processes become particularly relevant for the\nextra gauge boson search at the LHC.\nIn Section II we review the main properties of the model, in particular we derive the\ncouplings of new gauge bosons to SM fermions. In Section III, we discuss the bounds\non masses and couplings coming from EWPT and partial wave unitarity requirement. In\nSection IV, we discuss the prospects of detection of the new particles in Drell-Yan channels\nat the LHC, then we give out our conclusions. In Appendix A, we compute the spectrum\nof the new gauge bosons and in Appendix B we list numerical values corresponding to the\nconsidered scenarios.\n\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF THE MODEL\n\nThe class of models we are interested in follows the idea of dimensional deconstruction\n[11, 12, 13, 14] and was recently studied in [30]. The so-classified theories can also be seen\nas generalizations of the BESS model [31, 32, 36] to an arbitrary number of new triplets\nof gauge bosons. In their general formulation [20, 21, 22, 23, 24], they are based on the\n\n\f3\nSU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)K \u2297 U(1)Y gauge symmetry, and contain K + 1 non linear \u03c3-model scalar\nfields \u03a3i , i = 1, * * * , K + 1, transforming as\n\u03a31 \u2192 L\u03a31 U1\u2020 ,\n\u03a3i \u2192 Ui\u22121 \u03a3i Ui\u2020 ,\n\ni = 2, * * * , K,\n\n\u03a3K+1 \u2192 UK \u03a3K+1 R\u2020 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith Ui \u2208 SU(2), L \u2208 SU(2)L , R \u2208 U(1)Y . The related Lagrangian for scalars and gauge\nfields is given by\nL=\n\nK+1\nX\ni=1\n\nK\n\nfi2 Tr[D\u03bc \u03a3\u2020i D \u03bc \u03a3i ]\n\n1\n1\n1X\ni 2\nTr[(F\u03bc\u03bd\n) ] \u2212 Tr[(F\u03bc\u03bd (W\u0303 ))2 ] \u2212 Tr[(F\u03bc\u03bd (\u1ef8 ))2 ],\n\u2212\n2 i=1\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwith the covariant derivatives defined as follows\nD\u03bc \u03a31 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a31 \u2212 ig\u0303 W\u0303\u03bc \u03a31 + i\u03a31 g1 \u00c31\u03bc ,\ni\nD\u03bc \u03a3i = \u2202\u03bc \u03a3i \u2212 igi\u22121 \u00c3i\u22121\n\u03bc \u03a3i + i\u03a3i gi \u00c3\u03bc ,\n\ni = 2, * * * , K\n\n\u2032\nD\u03bc \u03a3K+1 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a3K+1 \u2212 igK \u00c3K\n\u03bc \u03a3K+1 + ig\u0303 \u03a3K+1 \u1ef8\u03bc ,\n\n(3)\n\na\nwhere \u00c3i\u03bc = \u00c3ia\n\u03bc \u03c4 /2 and gi are the gauge fields and gauge coupling constants associated to\n\nthe groups Gi , i = 1, * * * , K; W\u0303\u03bc = W\u0303\u03bca \u03c4 a /2, \u1ef8\u03bc = \u1ef8\u03bc \u03c4 3 /2 and g\u0303, g\u0303 \u2032 are the gauge fields and\ncouplings associated to SU(2)L and U(1)Y respectively, and fi are K +1 free parameters, the\nlink coupling constants. In the continuum limit, different fi can describe a generic warped\nmetric, while the flat case can have a correspondence with a scenario where all fi are equal.\nDirect couplings of new gauge bosons to SM fermions can be included in a way that\npreserve the symmetry of the model. The fermion Lagrangian is given by [30]\nLf ermions = \u03c8\u0304L i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8L + \u03c8\u0304R i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8R\n1\n\u03c8\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc g\u0303 W\u0303\u03bc \u03c8L\n\u2212\nPK\n1 + i=1 bi\nK\nX\nbi\n\u2212\n\u03c8\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc gi \u00c3i\u03bc \u03c8L\nPK\nb\n1\n+\nj=1 j\ni=1\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03c8\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc (g\u0303 \u2032 \u1ef8\u03bc + g\u0303 \u2032(B \u2212 L)\u1ef8\u03bc )\u03c8R \u2212 \u03c8\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc g\u0303 \u2032 (B \u2212 L)\u1ef8\u03bc \u03c8L\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere bi are arbitrary dimensionless parameters, which we assume universal, and \u03c8L(R)\ndenote the standard quarks and leptons. Direct couplings of the new gauge bosons to the\n\n\f4\nright-handed fermions can also be introduced but they are strongly constrained by data from\nnon-leptonic K-decays and b \u2192 s\u03b3 processes [37] to be of order 10\n\n\u22123\n\n[38].\n\nWe will not include these couplings here. Fermion mass terms can be built using the field\nU = \u03a31 \u03a32 * * * \u03a3K+1 transforming as U \u2192 LUR\u2020 [30]. The case K = 1 corresponds to the\nBESS model [31, 32] whose phenomenology was studied at the LHC in Ref. [39]. This model\nhas been recently rediscovered as a three site Higgsless model [40], and its phenomenology\nhas now received a renewed attention [9, 33, 34, 35]. The requirement of consistency of the\nmodel with electroweak precision data can be satisfied only via a strong cancelation between\ngauge-mixing and b-parameter contributions to \u01eb3 (S), ending up with fermiophobic vector\nresonances.\nIn this paper we concentrate on the case K = 2 where the EWPT constraints can\nbe satisfied without having necessarily fermiophobic resonances. The Drell-Yan channels\nbecome relevant here. For simplicity we will assume g1 = g2 and f1 = f3 . This choice\ncorresponds to a L-R symmetry in the new gauge sector, leading to a definite parity for the\ncorresponding gauge bosons once the standard gauge interactions are turned off.\nSumming up, the parameters of the model are g1 , f1 , f2 , b1 and b2 . For the gauge sector,\nthis model corresponds to the one proposed in Ref. [36] once fixed the set of parameters to\n\u221a\n\u221a\nbe: a = 0, b = c = d/2 = 2f12 /v 2 , g \u2032\u2032 = 2g1 , v = ( 2GF )\u22121/2 . In Appendix A, we give the\ncharged and neutral gauge bosons spectrum in the four site model.\n\nA.\n\nFermion gauge boson couplings\n\nUsing the explicit relations between gauge fields (W\u0303 , \u00c31,2 ) and mass eigenvectors\n\u00b1\n(W, W1,2\n) given in Eqs. (A8-A10), we get the charged fermion-boson interaction:\n\nwith\n\n\u0001\n+\n+\nLCC = \u03c8 \u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc T \u2212 \u03c8L aW W\u03bc+ + ac1 W1\u03bc\n+ ac2 W2\u03bc\n+ h.c.\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng\u0303 2 zW\nb\naW\n1\u2212 2\n1\u2212\n2\ng1 2\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng\u0303 2\ng1\nc\nb+ \u2212 2\na1 = \u2212\n2(1 + b+ )\ng1\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng\u0303 2 2\ng1\nc\nb\u2212 \u2212 2 z\na2 = \u2212\n2(1 + b+ )\ng1\ng\u0303\n= \u2212\u221a\n2\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\f5\nwhere\n1\nzW = (1 + z 4 )\n2\n\nb=\n\nb+ \u2212 b\u2212 z 2\n(1 + b+ )\n\nb\u00b1 = b1 \u00b1 b2\n\nz=p\n\nf1\nf12\n\n(9)\n\n+ 2f22\n\nand we have neglected terms O(g\u0303 4 /g14) and O(bi g\u0303 2 /g12). The reason why we neglect terms\n\nO(bi g\u0303 2/g12 ) is that the direct fermion couplings to the new resonances are of the order bi g1\n\nand we do not expect couplings bigger than the SM ones to be allowed, that is bi \u2264 g\u0303/g1 .\nThis is confirmed by the bounds from LEP discussed hereafter.

As previously mentioned, while \u01eb3 is strongly af\u01eb1,2 = \u2212\n\nfected by the direct fermion-boson couplings, having a linear dependence on the b-parameter,\n\u01eb1 and \u01eb2 receive a mild contribution. They display in fact only a quadratic behaviour in b\u00b1 ,\nowing to the SU(2) custodial symmetry.\nIn order to get bounds on the model parameters we have to compare with the experimental\nvalues for the \u01eb1,2,3 [41]:\n\u01ebexp\n= (5.0 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n1\n\n\u01ebexp\n= (\u22128.8 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22123,\n2\n\n\u01ebexp\n= (4.8 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10\u22123\n3\n\n(30)\n\n\f8\nafter adding to the new physics contribution the radiative corrections. In our analysis, we\nhave only considered the SM radiative corrections evaluated for mt = 172.5 GeV and an\nheavy Higgs boson, mH = 1 TeV, taken as a cut-off:\n\u01ebrad\n= 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n1\n\n\u01ebrad\n= \u22126.5 \u00d7 10\u22123,\n2\n\n\u01ebrad\n= 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n3\n\n(31)\n\nIn Figs. 1 and 2, we show the 95% C.L. experimental bounds from \u01eb1 and \u01eb3 (\u01eb2 doesn't\ngive any relevant limit thanks to its negative experimental value) in the plane (b1 , b2 ) for\ndifferent choices of heavy gauge boson masses, M1,2 , at fixed ratio z = M1 /M2 (see Eq. A7).\nThe bounds are obtained by the standard \u03c7-square fit\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u01ebi + \u01ebrad\n\u2212 \u01ebexp\ni\ni\n2\n= 5.99\n\u03c7i =\n\u03c3iexp\n\nwith i = 1, 3\n\n(32)\n\nwhich has been calculated exactly in the bi parameters. As an example of the dependence of\n\u221a\nthe \u01ebi constraints on the free parameter z, we consider four values z = (0.2, 0.4, 1/ 3, 0.8)\nand show the corresponding results in the four plots of Figs. 1 and 2. From there, it is clear\nthat for z = 0.2 there is a little match between experimental data and model parameters,\ninstead for z \u2265 0.4 there is a non negligible allowed strip. For each choice of z we choose\nM1,2 to vary inside the region allowed by the perturbative unitarity limit discussed in the\nsecond part of this section. The bounds from \u01eb1 are quite insensitive to the value of the\nresonance masses, those from \u01eb3 goes from up to down by increasing M1 . Also, the range\nof low M1 values for given z has been cut in order to be consistent with our neglecting of\nterms of O(g\u0303 4/g14) and taking into account Eq. (21).\nIt is instructive to translate these bounds on the plane delimited by the direct couplings\n\u00b1\nbetween the two charged (neutral) gauge bosons, W1,2\n(Z1,2 ), and ordinary matter. In fact,\n\nthe following expression for \u01eb3 can be easily derived by using Eqs. (7), (8), (13), (14) and\nneglecting terms O(g\u0303 4 /g14) and O(bi g\u0303 2 /g12):\n\u221a\n2 e\ne2\n1 c\n2 c\n(a1L \u2212 z 2 ae2L ) \u2212 2 2 (1 + z 4 )\n\u01eb3 \u223c (a1 \u2212 z a2 ) \u223c \u2212\ng1\ng1\ng 1 c\u03b8\n\n(33)\n\n\u00b1\nwhere ac1,2 are the fermion couplings of the charged W1,2\n-boson and aeiL (i = 1, 2) are the cou-\n\nplings of the neutral Z1,2 -boson to the left-handed electron component. \u00bfFrom the previous\nrelations we note that the contribution of the fermion couplings of Z2 and W2\u00b1 are multiplied\nby a factor z 2 . As a consequence, in order to satisfy the stringent bounds from \u01eb3 , fermion\ncouplings of the Z1 and W1\u00b1 resonances will be much more constrained with respect to the\n\n\f9\nZ2 and W2\u00b1 ones.\nz=0.4\n\nz = 0.2\n0.1\n0.15\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n2\n\n0.05\n\nb2\n\nb2\n\n0\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\n\u22120.05\n\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.05\n\nb1\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\nb1\n\nFIG. 1: 95% C.L. bounds on the plane (b1 , b2 ) from \u01eb1 (dash line) and \u01eb3 (solid line).

In both cases the central dot represents the so-\n\ncalled ideal cancellation. Also shown are the points corresponding to the scenarios 5 and 6 of the\nfollowing phenomenological analysis.\n\nM1 = 1 TeV and z = 0.8. The measurement of \u01eb3 strongly constraints the physical space of\nthe couplings, instead the measurement of \u01eb1 gives looser bounds. The central dot represents\nthe point where ac1 = ac2 = 0, the so-called ideal cancellation [30, 38, 43, 44, 45]. This is the\nassumption under which the most recent phenomenological analysis have been performed at\nthe LHC within the three site Higgsless model [34, 35]. There, in fact, the new resonances\nare forced by EWPT to be fermiophobic (or almost fermiophobic). In the four site extension\ninstead, while the relation between the couplings of the two gauge-boson triplets with SMfermions is strongly constrained by the \u01eb3 -parameter, their magnitude is weakly limited by\n\u01eb1 . As a result, the direct fermion-boson couplings can be of the same order of the SM\nones, as shown in Fig. 3. The phenomenological consequence is that, while the minimal\nHiggsless model can be explored only in very complex multi-particle processes (triple gauge\nboson production or vector boson fusion channels) which require high luminosity, the four\nsite Higgsless model could be proved in the more promising Drell-Yan channel already at\nthe LHC start-up.\nWe are not considering in this paper new physics loop corrections to the \u01eb parameters:\n\n\f11\nit has been recently shown that in some Higgsless model this effect can be important for\nreconciling these schemes with electroweak precision data [46, 47, 48].\nWe have instead considered the limits from LEP2 by computing the \u015c, T\u0302 , \u00db, W, Y, V and\nX [41]. The result is that T\u0302 , \u00db , and V vanish due to the SU(2) custodial symmetry, X, Y\nand W are of order bi g\u0303 2 /g12 or g\u0303 4/g14 and therefore do not alter the stringent limits already\nobtained from \u01eb3 .\n\nB.\n\nPerturbative unitarity bounds\n\nAs well known, in the SM without a light Higgs the vector boson scattering (VBS)\namplitudes violate perturbative unitarity at an energy scale of the order of \u039bHSM \u2243 1.7 TeV\n[49]. One of the strong motivations for Higgsless models, derived from 5D local gauge\ntheories, is their ability to delay such a unitarity violation to higher energies, via the exchange\nof the predicted extra gauge bosons.\nIn this section, we briefly discuss the issue of partial wave unitarity. The corresponding\nbound can be easily obtained by using the Equivalence Theorem relating, at high energy,\nthe gauge boson scattering amplitudes to the corresponding Goldstone ones [49, 50, 51, 52].\nLet us put g\u0303 = g\u0303 \u2032 = 0 and K = 2 in the Lagrangian given in Eq.

We also get:\n\n3\n\nA\u03c03 \u03c03 \u2192\u03c03 \u03c03 \u223c 0,\n\nA\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 \u2192\u03c03 \u03c03 \u223c\n\nf4 X s\n4 i=1 fi6\n\n(39)\n\nwhich are related to the physical scattering amplitudes ZL ZL \u2192 ZL ZL and WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 ZL ZL ,\nrespectively.\nBy considering the zero-isospin partial wave matrix for all VBS amplitudes with SM\nlongitudinal gauge bosons as external states\na0 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 s \uf8ed\n2\n16\u03c0 vSM\n\n1\n2\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(40)\n\n\u221a\nwith normalization factors for the two channels WL+ WL\u2212 and (1/ 2)ZL ZL as in Ref. [49],\nand requiring the partial wave bound |a0 | = 1 for the maximum eigenvalue, we get the\nresult shown by the green (lighter) curve in Fig. 4. The maximum energy scale, up to which\n\u221a\nthe perturbative unitarity can be delayed, is reached for z = 1/ 3 or equivalently f1 = f2\nwhich can be interpreted as a flat-metric scenario. In this particular case, such a delay with\nrespect to the answer of the SM without a light Higgs is modulated by the factor (K +1) \u2261 3:\n\u039bfour\u2212site = 3 \u039bHSM \u223c 5 TeV. However, the four site model has in addition two vector-boson\ntriplets with, potentially, bad behaving longitudinal scattering amplitudes. In order to be\npredictive, one has to require a fully perturbative regime for all involved particles. The\nunitarity limit must thus be extended, in order to ensure a good high energy behaviour for\nall scattering amplitudes, i.e. with both SM and extra gauge bosons as external states.\n\u221a\nFor energies much higher than the masses of the new vector bosons ( s >> M1,2 ), we can\ndetermine such a unitarity bound by considering the eigenchannel amplitudes corresponding\n\n\f13\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nz\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\ns (TeV)\n\u221a\nFIG. 4: Partial wave unitarity bounds on the plane ( s, z), by requiring |a0 | \u2264 1 for scattering\namplitudes with external SM gauge bosons (green lighter curve), and for scattering amplitudes\nwith both SM and extra gauge bosons as external states (blue darker curve). The allowed regions\nare on the left of the curves.\n\nto all possible longitudinal vector bosons. This can be done again by using the Equivalence\nTheorem and evaluating the chiral Lagrangian in the unitary gauge for all the vector bosons\ngiven by \u03a3i = exp[i~\n\u03c0i * ~\u03c4 /(2fi )]. In this gauge, the amplitudes are diagonal and the high\nenergy result is simply given by:\nA\u03c0i+ \u03c0i\u2212 \u2192\u03c0i+ \u03c0i\u2212 \u223c \u2212\n\nu\n,\n4fi2\n\nA\u03c0i3 \u03c0i3 \u2192\u03c0i3 \u03c0i3 \u223c 0,\n\nA\u03c0i+ \u03c0i\u2212 \u2192\u03c0i3 \u03c0i3 \u223c\n\ns\n.\n4fi2\n\n(41)\n\nRequiring |a0 | = 1 for the maximum eigenvalue, we get the blue (darker) curve shown in\nFig. 4. We see that, also in this case, the most delayed unitarity limit is realized for the choice\n\u221a\n\u221a\nK + 1 \u039bHSM \u223c\nf1 = f2 that is z = 1/ 3, and corresponds to the rescaling \u039btotal\nfour\u2212site =\n3 TeV. The four site Higgsless model can thus preserve perturbative unitarity over practically the whole effective energy range of the LHC. The spectrum of the new predicted\n\u00b1\nparticles W1,2\nand Z1,2 must lie within that region: M1,2 \u2264 \u039btotal\nfour\u2212site .\n\nIn our following phenomenological analysis, the most stringent unitarity bound in Fig. 4\nis considered. We conclude by noting that the three site unitarity limits are lower or equal\nto the ones of the four site model, given by the blue (darker) line of Fig. 4, depending on\np\nthe value of the ratio f1 / f12 + f22 .\n\n\f14\nIV.\n\nDRELL-YAN PRODUCTION AT THE LHC\n\n\u00b1\nWe can now consider the production of the six new gauge bosons, W1,2\nand Z1,2 , predicted\n\nby the four site Higgsless model at the LHC through Drell-Yan channels. Owing to the\nintroduction of direct couplings between ordinary matter and extra gauge bosons, in addition\nto the usual indirect ones due to the mixing, the experimental bounds from electroweak\nprecision data on the model parameters are indeed less stringent. As a consequence, and in\ncontrast with the existing fermiophobic Higgsless literature, quite large couplings between\nSM fermions and extra gauge bosons are allowed (see Fig. 3).\n\nA.\n\nProcesses and their computation\n\nWe analyze in detail two classes of processes,\n(i) pp \u2192 l+ l\u2212 , with l = e, \u03bc,\n\nand\n\n(ii) pp \u2192 l\u03bdl , with l = e, \u03bc.\nThe first class is characterized by two isolated charged leptons in the final state. The latter\ngives instead rise to one isolated charged lepton plus missing energy. In our notation, l\u03bdl indicates both l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l and l+ \u03bdl . The aforementioned neutral and charged Drell-Yan channels can\ninvolve the production of two neutral extra gauge bosons, Z1 and Z2 , and four charged extra\ngauge bosons W1\u00b1 and W2\u00b1 as intermediate states, respectively. Both classes of processes\nare described by the formula\nd\u03c3\n\nh1 h2\n\n(P1 , P2 , pf ) =\n\nXZ\n\ndx1 dx2 fi,h1 (x1 , Q2 )fj,h2 (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 ij (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf ),\n\n(42)\n\ni,j\n\nwhere pf summarizes the final-state momenta, fi,h1 and fj,h2 are the distribution functions of\nthe partons i and j in the incoming hadrons h1 and h2 with momenta P1 and P2 , respectively,\nQ is the factorization scale, and \u03c3\u0302 ij represent the cross sections for the partonic processes.\nSince the two incoming hadrons are protons and we sum over final states with opposite\ncharges, we find\nd\u03c3\n\nh1 h2\n\n(P1 , P2 , pf ) =\n\nZ\n\ndx1 dx2\n\nX\n\nh\nfQ\u0304,p (x1 , Q2 )fQ,p (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 Q\u0304Q (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf )\n\nQ=u,c,d,s,b\n\n+ fQ,p (x1 , Q2 )fQ\u0304,p (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 QQ\u0304 (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf )\n\ni\n\n(43)\n\n\f15\nand\nd\u03c3\n\nh1 h2\n\n(P1 , P2 , pf ) =\n\nZ\n\ndx1 dx2\n\nX Xh\nfD\u0304,p (x1 , Q2 )fU,p (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 D\u0304U (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf )\n\nU =u,c D=d,s\n\n+ f\u016a,p (x1 , Q2 )fD,p (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 \u016aD (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf )\n\n+ fD,p (x1 , Q2 )f\u016a,p (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 D\u016a (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf )\n+ fU,p (x1 , Q2 )fD\u0304,p (x2 , Q2 ) d\u03c3\u0302 UD\u0304 (x1 P1 , x2 P2 , pf )\n\ni\n\n(44)\n\nfor neutral and charged processes, respectively.\nThe tree-level amplitudes for the partonic processes have been generated by means of\nPHACT [53], a set of routines based on the helicity-amplitude formalism of Ref. [54]. The\nmatrix elements have been inserted in the Monte Carlo event generator (MCEG) FAST 2f,\ndedicated to Drell-Yan processes at the EW and QCD leading order. FAST 2f can compute\nsimultaneously the new-physics signal and the SM background. It can generate cross-sections\nand distributions for any observable, including any kind of kinematical cuts. The code is\nmoreover interfaced with PYTHIA [55]. This feature can allow more realistic analysis, once\nFAST 2f is matched with detector simulation programs. This extension and relative study\nwill be performed soon.\n\nB.\n\nNumerical setup\n\nFor the numerical results presented here, we have used the following input values [37]:\nMZ = 91.187 GeV, \u0393Z = 2.512 GeV, \u0393W = 2.105 GeV, \u03b1(MZ ) = 1/128.88, GF = 1.166 \u00d7\n\n10\u22125 GeV\u22122 . Additional input parameters are the quark-mixing matrix elements [56], whose\n\nvalues have been taken to be |Vud | = |Vcs | = 0.975, |Vus | = |Vcd | = 0.222, and zero for all other\nrelevant matrix elements. In our scheme, the weak mixing-angle and the W -boson mass are\nderived quantities. For the matrix element evaluation, we adopt the fixed-width scheme.\nAnd, we use the CTEQ6L [57] for the parton distribution functions at the factorization\nscales:\n2\nQ2 = Minv\n(l+ l\u2212 )\n\n(45)\n\nand\nQ2 =\n\n\u0001\n1 2\nPT (l) + PT2 (\u03bdl )\n2\n\n(46)\n\n\f16\nfor neutral and charged Drell-Yan processes, respectively, where Minv denotes the invariant\nmass and PT is the transverse momentum. This scale choice appears to be appropriate for\nthe calculation of differential cross sections, in particular for lepton distributions at high\nenergy scales.\nWe have, moreover, implemented a general set of acceptance cuts, appropriate for LHC\nanalysis, defined as follows:\n\u2022 lepton transverse momentum PT (l) > 20 GeV,\n\u2022 missing transverse momentum PTmiss > 20 GeV for pp \u2192 l\u03bdl ,\n\u2022 lepton pseudo-rapidity |\u03b7l | < 2.5, where \u03b7l = \u2212 log (tan \u03b8l /2), and \u03b8l is the polar angle\nof the charged lepton l with respect to the beam.\nFor the different processes considered, we have also used further cuts which are described\n\u221a\nin due time. We present results for the LHC at CM energy s = 14 TeV and an integrated\nluminosity from L = 100 pb\u22121 to L = 100 fb\u22121 .\n\nC.\n\nExtra gauge boson production in Drell-Yan channels\n\nIn the following two subsections we analyze the production of charged and neutral extra\ngauge bosons in Drell-Yan channels. We consider three different choices of mass spectrum\nand two sets of couplings to fermions for each choice inside the region allowed by EWPT\nand unitarity bounds:\n\u221a\nz = 1/ 3\n\nz = 0.4\nM1,2 ( GeV)\n\nb1,2\n\ng1\n\nM1,2 ( GeV)\n\nb1,2\n\nz = 0.8\ng1\n\nM1,2 ( GeV)\n\nb1,2\n\ng1\n\n1 500,1250 -0.05,0.09 2.7\n\n3 1732,3000 -0.07,0.04 8.1\n\n5 1000,1250 -0.08,0.03 3.5\n\n2 500,1250\n\n4 1732,3000 0.08,-0.04 8.1\n\n6 1000,1250\n\n0.06,0.02 2.7\n\n0.07,0.0 3.5\n\nTABLE I: Choices of parameters for the six considered scenarios. The corresponding value of g1\nevaluated by Eq. (21) is also given.\n\nThese six examples give an idea of the possible scenarios predicted by the four site\nHiggsless model. In the model in fact the ratio between the gauge boson masses of the\n\n\f17\nfirst and second triplet, i.e. z = M1 /M2 , is a free parameter. Hence, the distance between\nthe two masses is arbitrary as well (actually the mass eigenvalues are slightly different from\nM1,2 due to corrections O(g\u0303/g1)2 as given in Appendix A and B). We have thus chosen\n\u221a\nthree cases, corresponding to z = (0.4, 1/ 3, 0.8), and representing from left to right very\ndistant resonances, the flat-metric scenario, and a spectrum which tends to degeneracy by\nincreasing z.\nAlso the magnitude of the couplings has a wide spectrum, as can be seen for example\nin Fig. 3 for the case z = 0.8 and M1 = 1 TeV. In order to show the importance and the\nimpact at the LHC of the related direct fermion-boson couplings, we consider two points in\neach plane (b1 , b2 ): the first in the region down on the left of the allowed range, and the\nsecond high on right (see Figs. 1,2). These are reported in the six scenarios listed above.\nWe are now ready to discuss numerical results for the charged and neutral Drell-Yan\nchannels.\n\n1.\n\nZ1 and Z2 production at the LHC\n\nIn this section, we present some cross sections and distributions for the leptonic process\npp \u2192 l+ l\u2212 with l = e, \u03bc. These final states allow to analyze the production of the two\nneutral extra gauge bosons, Z1,2 , predicted by the four site Higgsless model.\nGeneral studies of Higgsless models have shown that the new strongly interacting vector\nbosons are expected to be produced at high CM energies. We thus select this kinematical\nconfiguration by imposing an additional cut on the invariant mass of the lepton pair, i.e.\nMinv (l+ l\u2212 ) \u2265 400 GeV.\nAs an illustration of the behaviour and the impact of the new predicted particles at the\nLHC, we have chosen to analyze the following three differential cross-sections:\n(i) distribution in the invariant mass of the reconstructed Z1,2 -boson, Minv (l+ l\u2212 ),\n(ii) distribution of the scattering angle in the CM frame, cos \u03b8l\u2217 , taken in the region under\nthe peak of the new resonances, i.e. |Minv (l+ l\u2212 ) \u2212 Mi | \u2264 3\u0393i (i = 1, 2),\n(iii) forward-backward charge asymmetry versus the dilepton invariant mass.\nAs mentioned in Sect.

We sum over e, \u03bc. Standard cuts and legends as in the text.\n\n\u221a\n(0.4, 1/ 3, 0.8), and various b1,2 -sets. The corresponding neutral fermion-boson couplings\nare summarized in Table V of Appendix B.\nWe start from the spectrum of the neutral extra gauge bosons as it could appear in\nthe Drell-Yan channel at the LHC. In Fig. 5, we plot the total number of events as a\nfunction of the dilepton invariant mass, Minv (l+ l\u2212 ), for the six aforementioned scenarios.\nWe have checked that all these cases are outside the exclusion limit from direct searches at\nthe Tevatron with an integrated luminosity L=4 fb\u22121 [58]. From top to bottom, the three\ncurves in each plot represent the first b1,2 -setup, the latter, and the SM prediction at fixed\nM1,2 masses. We sum over e, \u03bc and apply standard acceptance cuts.\n\n\f19\nThese examples show four peculiarities of the model. First of all, the masses of the two\nneutral resonances Z1,2 are not equally spaced. They can be either very distant for low zvalues (see Figs. 5a and 5b), or they can tend to be almost degenerate for high z-values (see\nFig. 5c). For some values of the b1,2 -parameter (see for example the case 6), one of the two\nresonances could also disappear leaving a single-resonant (or even not-resonant) spectrum\nlike in Fig. 5d. A second feature is related to the interference between signal and SM\nbackground. All four plots exhibit indeed a sizeable depletion of the total number of events,\ncompared to the SM prediction, in the off-peak region. This characteristic is particularly\nevident by increasing the new gauge boson masses (see Figs. 5b and 5c), and improves the\ndetection rate. A further distinctive behaviour is represented by the width magnitude. It\nindeed increases with the fifth power of the extra gauge boson mass. One can thus pass from\nconfigurations with very narrow resonances, see Fig. 5a, to scenarios characterized by broad\npeaks, or even shoulders as in Fig. 5b. The last feature concerns the relative size of the\nZ1,2 resonances. Tab. V in Appendix B shows that in most part of the parameter space the\nZ1 -fermion couplings are smaller than the Z2 -fermion ones. As a consequence, the height of\nthe Z1 -resonance is less pronounced than the Z2 -peak. This feature can be washed out by\nthe PDF effect, but it is clearly visible in Fig. 5c.\nIn order to have an idea of the detection rate expected at the LHC for the Drell-Yan\nproduction of the extra Z1,2 gauge bosons, in Tab. II we have listed signal and total event\nnumber in the two distinct on-peak regions |Minv (l+ l\u2212 ) \u2212 M1,2 | < \u03931,2 for the six considered\nscenarios. From Tab. II, it is clear that while the second b1,2 -setup, at each fixed M1,2 mass,\nwould need high luminosity to be detected, the first b1,2 -setup could already be visible at\nthe LHC start-up with a luminosity L\u2243 1 fb\u22121 .\nIn presence of two resonances, the four site Higgsless model could not be easily misidentified. However, in the case depicted in Fig. 5d where only one resonance survives, the\nmodel-degeneracy problem fully arises. Many models predict in fact an extra neutral vector\nboson, one for all the sequential SM (SSM). Disentangling the various theories, and tracing\nback the lagrangian parameters is not an easy task. To this end, a useful observable, longly\nstudied in the literature, is represented by the forward-backward charge asymmetry AF B .\nThe sensitivity of AF B measurements to new physics like additional Z \u2032 -bosons has been\ndiscussed by several authors [59, 60].

In this analysis, we follow the criteria of Ref. [60] and\nsimulate the quark direction from the boost of the dilepton system with respect to the beam\naxis. As a measure of the boost, we define the dilepton rapidity y = 1/2 \u00d7 ln[(E + pz )/(E \u2212\npz )], and identify the quark direction through the sign of y. We further impose the rapidity\nto be bigger than one, |y| \u2265 1. This cut ensures that the fraction of high mass dilepton\nevents with a correctly assigned quark direction is around 80%.\nWe study both on-resonance and off-resonance asymmetries for the single-resonant scenario depicted in Fig. 5d. In the first case, we consider the on-peak region |Minv (l+ l\u2212 )\u2212M2 | <\n3\u03932 , and plot the angular distribution of Eq. (47), including signal and background. In order to illustrate how AF B could help in solving the model-degeneracy problem, in Fig. 6a\nwe compare the four site Higgsless model with the sequential SM, which both predict an\nextra neutral vector boson (Z2 ).

(47) is indeed proportional\nto the difference between the two couplings squared, AF B \u221d [(af2L )2 \u2212 (af2R )2 ].\nAs a further tool to separate the two models, in Fig. 6b we plot the asymmetry for\ncontinuum dilepton events at high CM energy scales.

Inside the central\nuncolored region no resonance is visible in the Drell-Yan channel. Left (right) panel: z = 0.4\n(z = 0.8).\n\nThe SM prediction is shown as a reference. The measurement of the dips, pointing at\ndifferent CM-energy values according to the considered model, represents an additional\npowerful tool to understand the nature of the neutral resonance. In this particular case, the\noff-resonance AF B could also reveal the double-resonant structure of the four site Higgsless\nmodel signal, not appreciable in the dilepton invariant mass distribution (compare with\nFig. 5d). The first dip, related to the Z1 -boson mass, gives indeed a 3.8\u03c3 effect if compared\nto the SM prediction, for an high luminosity L=100 fb\u22121 .\nAfter analyzing the spectrum of the extra Z1,2 -bosons, and how their nature could be\ninvestigated through asymmetry measurements, let us summarize the possibility to detect\nthese new particles at the LHC as a function to the integrated luminosity. In Fig. 7 we plot\nthe 5\u03c3-discovery contours at L=100 fb\u22121 in the plane (\u00e2e2L , M2 ), where \u00e2e2L is the left-handed\ncoupling between the Z2 -boson and the SM electron (in -e units) and M2 is related to the\nZ2 -mass by Eq.

We assume the maximum value for the fermion-boson couplings allowed by EWPT and\nTevatron, as shown by the upper curves in Fig. 7. The discovery curves are for Z1 (red, darker) and\nZ2 (green, lighter) gauge bosons. Right panels: Luminosity vs electron-boson left-handed coupling\n(the electric charge -e is factorized) needed for a 5\u03c3-discovery for z = 0.4 (up) and z = 0.8 (down)\nwith M2 = 1250 GeV and M1 = zM2 . The discovery curves are for Z1 (red, darker) and Z2 (green,\nlighter) gauge bosons. In all the figures, we sum over e, \u03bc and apply standard cuts. The inset plots\nshow the zoomed-in low-luminosity region.\n\nvalues of the parameter z. The coupling ae1L is fixed by using the expression of \u01eb3 given in\nEq. (33) after including radiative corrections, and comparing it to the experimental value,\n\u01ebexp\n3 . Looking at the upper part of the plots and going from top to bottom, the first curve\nrepresents the \u00e2e2L maximum values allowed by EWPT as a function of M2 . The small black\n\n\f24\ntriangle in the right panel gives the direct limits from Tevatron for a luminosity L = 4 fb\u22121\n[58]. This region is not visible in the left panel because of the different mass range. As to\nthe detection, the dark-grey region between the first two curves represents the parameter\nspace where both Z1,2 resonances are simultaneously visible in the Drell-Yan channel, while\nthe dashed region shows the range where only the Z2 -boson could be detected. The small\ngrey region for low masses shows the range where only the Z1 -boson could be detected. The\nlower part of the plot is specular. In the central uncolored region one should measure other\nchannels like di-boson production and W W scattering. Notice that for low z values, the Z1 boson couplings to fermions are much more bounded by EWPT (Eq. (33)), as a consequence\nthe Z1 visibility region by DY production is smaller with respect to larger z values.\nThe main information one gets from Fig. 7 is that the four site Higgsless model can\nbe explored at the LHC in the favoured Drell-Yan channel, over a large portion of the\nparameter space, without invoking much more complex multi-particle processes like di-boson\nproduction or vector boson fusion as in the usual Higgsless literature [34, 35]. Moreover,\nthe new Z1,2 gauge bosons could be discovered in the early stage of the LHC data taking at\nvery low luminosity.\nFig. 8 (left panels) shows in fact that the minimum integrated luminosity required to\nobserve the low edge of the spectrum is around L\u2243 1-2fb\u22121 . Notice that the raise of luminosity for low masses for z = 0.8 is due to the Tevatron exclusion region shown in Fig. 7.\nIn Fig. 8 (right panels), we plot in addition the luminosity needed for a 5\u03c3 discovery of a\nZ2 -boson with mass M2 = 1.25 TeV and a Z1 -boson with mass M1 = zM2 as a function of\nthe left-handed electron-boson coupling.\n\n2.\n\nW1\u00b1 and W2\u00b1 production at the LHC\n\nIn this section, we present some cross sections and distributions for the leptonic process\npp \u2192 l\u03bdl with l = e, \u03bc and l\u03bdl = l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l , l+ \u03bdl . These final states allow to analyze the production\n\n\u00b1\nof the four charged extra gauge bosons, W1,2\n, predicted by the four site Higgsless model.\n\nAs we said previously, we are interested in the high energy region where the new strongly\ninteracting vector bosons are expected to be produced. We thus impose an additional cut\non the transverse momentum of the lepton pair, PT (l\u03bdl ) \u2265 150 GeV, which selects large\n\u221a\nCM-energies ( s \u2265 300 GeV).

The next three columns give signal and total (including the SM\np\nsig\ntot\nbackground) event number for the W1\u00b1 production, and the statistical significance \u03c3 = Nevt\n/ Nevt\nfor an integrated luminosity L=10 fb\u22121 . The last three columns give the corresponding results for\nW2\u00b1 production.\n\nThese examples show again some peculiar predictions of the model. First of all, the\nspectra of neutral and charged gauge sectors are almost degenerate (Mi,c \u2243 Mi,n with i =\n1, 2). The same peaking structure is thus expected in both neutral and charged Drell-Yan\nchannels. This is clearly visible in Figs. 9b,c where the peaks in the lepton transverse mass\nare centered on the same values as those ones in the dilepton invariant mass reported in\nFigs. 5b,c. In these cases, we have a cross-checkable double signal. The situation can however\nbe different, depending on masses and couplings. For example, if one considers the first\nscenario of Tab. I, one realizes that while in the neutral channel the two new resonances are\nboth visible (at least at parton level), in the charged channel only the heavier one survives.\nThe first W1\u00b1 -boson peak is indeed washed out by the very low couplings between charged\nextra gauge bosons and SM fermions (see Tab. IV in Appendix B). In this case, in order\nto have the full information, exploring the two channels is mandatory. The last plot in Fig.\n9d is again a mirror of Fig. 5d, i.e. in this scenario only the heavier resonances W2\u00b1 and Z2\ncould be detected in their respective channels (with L \u223c 100 fb\u22121 ).\nIn order to estimate the detection rate expected at the LHC for the Drell-Yan production\n\u00b1\nof the extra W1,2\ngauge bosons, in Tab.

III, one can\nsee that the charged Drell-Yan channel has generally a higher sensitivity compared to the\nneutral one, for a given scenario. In some cases the statistical significance is about a factor\ntwo bigger than the previous neutral case, however the charged Drell-Yan observables are\nnot that clean. In order to have a well defined information on the four site Higgsless model\npredictions, neutral and charged Drell-Yan channels are thus complementary. And, more\nimportant, there are regions in the parameter space where they could be both investigated\n\u00b1\nfor the search of all six extra gauge bosons, W1,2\nand Z1,2 , at the LHC start-up with a\n\nluminosity of the order of L\u2243 1-2 fb\u22121 for M1,2 \u2264 1 TeV.\nLet us finally comment on the dependence of the discovery potential in the charged\nchannel in the parameter space of the model. In Fig. 10 we plot the 5\u03c3-discovery contours\nat L=100 fb\u22121 for z = 0.4 (left) and z = 0.8 (right) in the plane (ac2 , M2 ) where ac2 is the\n\n\f28\nW2 charged coupling and M2 is related to the W2 mass by Eq. (A5). The upper and lower\nparts of the plot are excluded by EWPT, the black triangle is the region excluded by the\ndirect search at the Tevatron with 4 fb\u22121 . Inside the dark-grey regions both W1,2 are visible;\ninside the dashed ones only W2 can be detected. Inside the central uncolored region no\nresonance is visible in the Drell-Yan channel. Notice that, while for z = 0.8 the region in\nwhich one looses the first resonance is small, for smaller z-values this region increases and\nfor example, for z = 0.4, the four site model could be misidentified with schemes with only\none triplet of new resonances. For this portion of parameter space the di-boson and/or the\nfusion channels are mandatory for disentangling among different models.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work we have studied the phenomenological consequences of the four site Higgsless\nmodel, a deconstructed theory which can derive from the discretization of the fifth dimension\non a lattice, and is based on the SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)1 \u00d7 SU(2)2 \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge symmetry. The\nmodel represents an extension of the minimal three site version (or BESS model), longly\ninvestigated in the literature, which includes three heavy vector bosons, W1\u00b1 and Z1 . The\nfour site model extends the gauge sector to four charged and two neutral extra gauge bosons,\n\u00b1\nW1,2\nand Z1,2 . We have analysed their properties and the prospects for their direct search\n\nat the LHC.\nOne of the strong motivations for Higgsless models is their ability to delay the unitarity\nviolation of VBS amplitudes to energy scales higher than those predicted by the SM without\na light Higgs, just via the exchange of the above mentioned extra gauge bosons. The\ndrawback is the strong tension between the unitarity requirement and the bounds coming\nfrom the electroweak precision tests. In the minimal three site model, the request to reconcile\nunitarity and EWPT brings to a fermiophobic scenario, where the extra gauge bosons can\nbarely interact with ordinary matter. In this case, the only production processes available\nto search for the new particles are those dominated by boson-boson interactions. Hence, one\nhas to rely on difficult multi-particle processes which require high luminosity to be revealed,\nthat is vector boson fusion and triple gauge boson production. The recent Higgsless literature\nhas been focused on this side.\nThe novelty of the four site Higgsless model consists in reconciling unitarity and EWPT\n\n\f29\nbounds without imposing the extra vector bosons to be fermiophobic, owing to the inclusion\nof direct fermion-boson couplings in addition to those ones coming from usual mixing terms.\nWe have analysed in detail the constraints on masses and couplings of the extra gauge bosons\ncoming from unitarity requirement and EW precision data consistency. We have found that,\nasking for all VBS amplitudes with both SM and extra gauge bosons as external states to\nbe unitarized, the perturbative regime can be extended up to energy scales of the order of\n\u221a\ns \u2243 3 TeV, thus higher than those predicted by the SM with no light Higgs and by the\nthree site minimal version. Hence, the spectrum of the new gauge bosons must lie within a\nfew TeV, a region which represents the main effective energy range available at the LHC.\nWe have moreover investigated the impact of the EW precision measurements expressed in\nterms of the \u01ebi parameters on the couplings of the extra gauge bosons to ordinary matter.\nWhile \u01eb3 gives the strongest bound, imposing a strict relation between the couplings of the\ntwo vector boson triplets, \u01eb1 weakly limits their size owing to the SU(2) custodial symmetry\n(\u01eb2 is uneffective). The fermion-boson couplings can be thus of the same order of the SM\nones. As a consequence, the Drell-Yan process becomes an open channel for the direct search\nof the extra gauge bosons at the LHC.\nWe have analysed in detail the potential detection rate of the new particles, evaluating\ncross sections and distributions for charged and neutral Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. In\norder to show a full view, we have considered different possible scenarios predicted by the\nfour site Higgsless model. There, the resonances are not equally spaced; so we have studied\nthe spectrum, going from very spaced cases to almost degenerate ones.\nThe outcome is that all six extra gauge bosons could be detected at the LHC over a large\nportion of the parameter space (i.e. couplings and masses) for a luminosity at regime. The\nlow-edge mass spectrum, below 1 TeV, could be already discovered during the early stage\nof the LHC data taking, with a start-up luminosity of the order of L \u2243 1 fb\u22121 .\nThese results do not include the detector simulation. At present, this work is in progress,\nbut we do not expect a drastic change in our conclusions owing to the very clean signals.\n\nAPPENDIX A: GAUGE BOSON SPECTRUM\n\nThe charged gauge boson mass
