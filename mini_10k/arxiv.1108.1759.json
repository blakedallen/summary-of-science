It has been shown long ago that in three-dimensional spacetime the ChernSimons coupling is quantized, because the magnetic event emits an electric charge which must\nbe quantized according to the standard Dirac rule. Recently, the concept of dynamical extended\ncharged events has been introduced, and it has been argued that they should play as central a role\nas that played by particles or ordinary branes. In this article we show that in the presence of a\nChern-Simons coupling, a magnetically charged extended event emits an extended object, which\ngeometrically is just like a Dirac string, but it is observable, obeys equations of motion, and may\nbe electrically charged. We write a complete action principle which accounts for this effect. The\naction involves two Chern-Simons terms, one integrated over spacetime and the other integrated\nover the worldvolume of the submanifold that is the union of the Dirac world-sheet and the history of the emitted physical object. By demanding that the total charge emitted by a composite\nextended magnetic event be quantized according to Dirac's rule, we find a quantization condition\nfor the Chern-Simons coupling.

The extension to more general p-form potentials and higher dimensions is\nalso discussed. For the case D = 11, p = 3, our result for the quantization of the Chern-Simons\ncoupling was obtained previously in the context of M-theory, a remarkable agreement that makes\nthe existence of events even more compelling.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDynamical charged events where introduced in [1]. It\nwas argued there that they are forced upon us by the\nprinciple of electric-magnetic duality, which states that\nelectric and magnetic fields must be treated on equal\nfooting, and that therefore one must consider both electric and magnetic sources in the Maxwell equations. Unlike ordinary particles or branes, events obey no equations of motion within the spacetime where they happen.\nHowever, they do produce fields within that spacetime,\nacting as sources according to the standard field equations. These fields act, in turn, on ordinary charged particles and branes. In order to have a closed system in\nwhich events obey the principle of action and reaction,\nrather than being just external sources, one must endow\nthem with dynamics. This may be done by considering ordinary spacetime as embedded in a larger one, and\ndescribing events as the imprint left on the embbeded\nspacetime by an object impinging on it from an extra\ndimension. Thus, a charged point event is considered as\nthe imprint of a particle which hits spacetime. Similarly\nfor extended events.\nA point event is the simplest member of a family which\nincludes also extended events. An extended event is the\nimprint left on spacetime when a p-brane, with p \u2265 1, hits\nit. Just as point events, extended events do not obey an\nequation of motion in the D-dimensional spacetime because their dynamics takes place in the extra dimensions.\n\nThis is the key difference between events and particles,\nor ordinary extended objects. For example, a closed onedimensional event is a loop in the D-dimensional spacetime with arbitrary shape: it can be timelike, spacelike,\nnull, or a combination of all three. It can also go forward and backwards in time. The observation of an event\nwould not be a violation of causality or of any conservation law, it would rather be evidence for the presence of\nextra dimensions.\nIn contradistinction with events, ordinary particles,\nor branes, with either electric or magnetic charge, live\nwithin the D-dimensional spacetime, and obey action\nprinciples and ordinary dynamical laws there.\nIt should be stressed that events occur in Lorentzian\nspacetime, and are to be distinguished from instantons,\nwhich are solutions of the Euclidean equations and describe quantum mechanical tunneling. Also the fact that\nevents, when viewed as a result of an object impinging\nfrom an extra dimension, need no fine tuning, contrasts\nwith the point of view adopted in the \"S-brane\" literature, as advocated, for instance, in [2].\nThe previous remarks have been made to situate events\nwithin the theoretical framework. In the present article we shall employ particular configurations of extended\nevents and discuss their influence on ordinary branes and\nfields, according to an action principle which involves\nonly the D-dimensional spacetime. We will therefore\nmake no use here of the fact that the charged events are\n\n\f2\nimprints from extra dimensions, other than occasional\nconceptual comments.\nThe plan of the paper is the following. Sec. II recalls\nbriefly the standard theory of magnetic poles and their\nassociated strings, given by Dirac [3] in 1948, and its generalization to extended objects developed in [4]. It is observed that the fundamental property that a Dirac string\ncannot go through a charged particle, the \"Dirac veto\",\nholds as well for Dirac strings emanating from magnetic\nevents and that, as a consequence, the standard quantization rule for the product of electric and magnetic charges\nremains valid.\nNext, in Sec. III, the treatment is extended to the simplest non-linear Chern-Simons coupling, a 1-form electric\npotential in D = 5 dimensions. An action principle is\ngiven. Its most striking new feature is that it brings\nin a new object into the theory. It is an extended object emitted by the magnetic event, whose history is a\nsemi-infinite surface, which geometrically is just like the\nworlsheet of the Dirac string, but it is observable, obeys\nequations of motion, and may be electrically charged.\nThe Chern-Simons action (III.3) is then the sum of two\nChern-Simons terms: the standard one for spacetime,\nand an aditional one over an embedded surface \u03a3 which\ncontains the magnetic event, and it is the union of the\nstring worldsheet and the history of the physical emitted\nobject.\nIt is found that, due to the non-linearity, the Dirac\nveto takes a stronger form: As before, Dirac strings\ncannot cross electric worldlines, but now they cannot\ncross among themselves either. This applies both to\nDirac strings emanating from different magnetic events\n(or poles) as well as to self intersections of one Dirac\nstring (The strengthening of the Dirac veto was previously established, in a different setting, in Ref. [5]).\nNext, in Sec. IV, we demand that the electric charge\nemitted by the magnetic event, which is proportional to\nthe Chern-Simons coupling, should be quantized according to the standard Dirac rule, and thus infer the quantization of that coupling, generalizing the result of Ref.\n[6] for D = 3. To that effect we introduce a composite\nevent formed by two extended magnetic events separated\nin time, and such that the product of their transverse\nspaces, together with the time axis, is the entire spacetime. We obtain directly in this way, a result previously\narrived at using dimensional reduction and the Witten\neffect [7] in four spacetime dimensions [8].\nFinally, in that section, we show that the emitted electric charge is given by the first Chern class of the electromagnetic field over a two-dimensional surface linking\nthe first magnetic event.\nNext in Sec. V we extend the analysis to higher D and\np. For a 1-form electric potential in D = 2n+1 spacetime\ndimensions, the composite object is formed by n extended\nmagnetic events separated in time such that the product\nof their transverse spaces, together with the time axis,\nis the entire spacetime. We pay special attention to the\n\n3-form appearing in supergravity. Sec. VI is devoted to\nconcluding remarks.\n\nII.\n\nDIRAC STRINGS AND DIRAC VETO\nA.\n\nPure Maxwell theory\n\nIn his classical paper [3] of 1948, Dirac invented an\naction principle for the electromagnetic field interacting with both electric and magnetic sources. In what\nwe would now call the \"electric representation\", the 1form electric potential A\u03bc couples minimally to electric\nsources, in the standard way. On the other hand, the\ncoupling to the magnetic sources is achieved through the\nintroduction of a Dirac string which emanates from the\nmagnetic pole. In the case of ordinary point particles\ncarrying magnetic charge studied by Dirac, the string is\nindeed a string, that is, a semi-infinite one dimensional\nline whose boundary is the magnetic pole. As the magnetic pole traces a one dimensional worldline the Dirac\nstring traces a two dimensional worldsheet whose boundary is the magnetic worldline. If the embedding of the\nworldsheet is described by\nx\u03bc = y \u03bc (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 ),\n\n\u2212\u221e < \u03be 1 < \u221e, 0 < \u03be 2 < \u221e (II.1)\n\nthen the worldline of the magnetic pole is\nx\u03bc = z \u03bc (\u03be1 ) = y \u03bc (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 = 0).\n\n(II.2)\n\nWe will denote the string worldsheet (II.1) by \u03a32+ , where\nthe subindex 2 indicates its dimension and the superscript + recalls that \u03be 2 > 0.\nThe coupling of the magnetic source to the electromagnetic field is achieved by modifying the definition of the\nelectromagnetic field strength\nF = dA\n\n(II.3)\n\nF = dA + \u2217 G+ ,\n\n(II.4)\n\nto read instead,\n\nwhere\nG\u03bc\u03bd\n+\n\nZ\n=g\n\u03a32+\n\n\u03b4 (4) (x \u2212 y)dy \u03bc \u2227 dy \u03bd .\n\n(II.5)\n\nThe two-form G+ is the current associated to the string\nworldsheet. The current G+ is not conserved because \u03a32+\nhas a boundary on the magnetic pole. One has\nZ\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bc G+ (x) = jmag (x) = g \u03b4 (4) (x \u2212 z)dz \u03bd .\n(II.6)\nThe Maxwell action reads\nZ\n1\nIM = \u2212\nF \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd d4 x,\n4\n\n(II.7)\n\n\f3\nwith F\u03bc\u03bd given by (II.4). It depends on both A\u03bc (x) and\ny \u03bc (\u03c4, \u03c3). If one varies IM with respect to the worldline\nz \u03bc (\u03c4 ) of the magnetic source one finds,\nZ\n\u03b4IM = g\n(d\u2217 F )\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b4y \u03c1 dy \u03bc \u2227 dy \u03bd ,\n(II.8)\nworldsheet\n\nwhich on account of the Maxwell equation,\nd\u2217 F = \u2217 jel ,\n\n(II.9)\n\nbecomes,\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b4IM = g\nworldsheet\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\n( jel )\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b4y dy \u2227 dy .\n\n(II.10)\n\nThe variation (II.10) vanishes automatically provided\nthat the string worldsheet is never crossed by an electric worldline. This is the original Dirac veto. Note that\nthe veto allows j \u03bc to be tangent to the string worldsheet\nbecause then the integrand in Eq. (II.10) vanishes. No\nrestriction is imposed on the shape of the worldsheet itself, which is a reflection of the fact that the y \u03bc (\u03be) may\nbe thought of as purely gauge variables for \u03be 2 > 0. For\n\u03be 2 = 0, Eq. (II.2) must hold.\nWhen one passes to quantum mechanics, the Dirac\nveto, combined with the pure gauge character of the\nstring, leads to the quantization condition [3, 9] for the\nproduct of the electric charge e and the magnetic charge\ng,\neg = 2\u03c0~m,\n\n(II.11)\n\nwhere m is an integer. That analysis will not be repeated\nhere.\nB.\n\nExtended Sources\n\nThe preceding discussion can be generalized to deal\nwith electric and magnetic extended sources coupled to a\np-form electric potential. The analysis, the formulae and\nthe conclusions apply equally well to the case of ordinary\nbranes and extended events. If the spacetime is D and\nthe dimension of the \"worldline\" of the electric extended\nobject is p, then the dimension of the worldline of the\nmagnetic electric object is D \u2212 p \u2212 2.

Rather, e has units of\nlength to the power of (D \u2212 2p \u2212 2)/2 . However, the\nproduct of e and g is still dimensionless and the quantization condition (II.11) continues to hold [4].\nIII.\n\nADDITION OF A CHERN-SIMONS\nCOUPLING FOR D = 5 AND p = 1\nA.\n\nAction\n\nWe will first postulate an action and discuss its main\ngeneral properties and implications. Next we will derive\nthe equations of motion and discuss the phenomenon of\nemission of electric charge by a magnetic source.\nThe most striking new feature of the introduction of\na Chern-Simons coupling is that, in order to write the\naction principle, one needs to bring in a new geometrical\nobject into the theory. It is a semi-infinite surface, which,\nfor D = 5 has three dimensions.\nThe boundary of this new surface is the magnetic\nevent, just as it is the case with the Dirac worldsheet \u03a33+ .\nBut unlike the latter, the new surface is the history of a\ntwo-dimensional physical extended object, which obeys\nequations of motion. This new object, which emerges\nfrom the magnetic event, may have electric charge. We\nwill call its worldsheet \u03a33\u2212 .\nThe equations of its embedding in the D = 5 spacetime\nmay be written just as those of the Dirac string, but with\nthe parameter \u03be 3 taking negative values. We will denote\nplainly by \u03a33 , the glueing, at their common boundary\n\u03be 3 = 0 (the magnetic event), of \u03a33+ , and \u03a33 , as illustrated\nin Fig 1. The surface \u03a33 , is infinite in all directions, and\nits associated current:\nZ\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\nG (x) = g\n\u03b4 (5) (x \u2212 y)dy \u03bc \u2227 dy \u03bd \u2227 dy \u03c1 , (III.1)\n\u03a33\n\n\f4\nis conserved,\n\u2202\u03bc G\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = 0.\n\n(III.2)\n\nEmitted\nx0\n\nThe Chern-Simons action (III.3) will be the sum of two\nChern-Simons terms: the standard one for a five dimensional spacetime, and an aditional one over an embedded\nthree dimensional surface \u03a33 which contains the magnetic event,\nZ\nZ\n\u03b1g\n\u03b1\ndA \u2227 dA \u2227 A +\ndA \u2227 A.\n(III.3)\nICS =\n6\n2 \u03a33\nNote that normally one would couple a three dimensional worldline to a fundamental 3-form A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 . Then the\nassociated charge would not be the electric charge, but\nrather, the charge associated with that fundamental 3form (see, for example, Ref. [11]). However, here, the\nthree form is not fundamental since it is constructed out\nof the 1-form A as the Chern-Simons 3-form dA \u2227 A. As\na consequence, we will find below that, generically, there\nis a contribution to the electric current which has support on the worldsheet \u03a3\u2212 , in addition to the one coming\nfrom the ordinary minimal coupling to worldlines. In that\nsense, the extended object whose history is \u03a3\u2212 may be\nelectrically charged.\nOne is in the presence of an interesting sequence. Particles whose worldline has dimension one couple to the\none dimensional Chern-Simons term A. Two dimensional extended objects, whose worldline has dimension\nthree, couple through the Chern-Simons term of dimension three, dA \u2227 A. The possibility of coupling extended\nobjects to a 1-form through the composite Chern-Simons\nform built from it, has been emphasized in Refs. [12],\n[13].\nThe complete action will be the sum of four terms,\nZ\nI = IM + ICS \u2212 \u2217 jparticles \u2227 A + IK .\n(III.4)\nHere jparticles is the conserved electric current of a collection of point particles,\nX Z\n\u03bc\njparticles\n=\nqi \u03b4 (5) (x \u2212 w(i) )dwi\u03bc ,\nwhere qi and wi\u03bc (\u03c4 ) are the electric charge and worldline\nof the i-th electric charge. The kinetic term IK is the\nsum of two terms, one for the electrically charged point\nparticles, and another for the new object with a three\ndimensional worldline that we just described,\nIK = Iparticles + I\u2212 .\n\n\u03a3+\nDirac Membrane\n\nFIG.\n1: The surface \u03a3 for a single magnetic event. The magMonday, August 8, 2011\nnetic event of strength \u2212g is the common boundary of two\ndifferent worldvolumes: the Dirac string worldsheet (shaded),\nparametrized with \u03be 3 > 0 and the extended electric object worldsheet (dark), with \u03be 3 < 0. The Dirac string has\nan associated current G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\nsupported on it, while the ex+\ntended electric object has G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\u2212 . The complete surface is infinite in all directions and has an associated conserved current\nG\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n+ G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n+\n\u2212 . We have chosen \u2212g as the charge of\nthe magnetic event in order that, with the conventions used\nin the main text, the electric object is emitted to the future.\nThen \u2202x0 /\u2202\u03be 3 < 0.\n\nwhereas for the electrically charged extended object the\naction is proportional to its worldvolume,\nZ p\n\u2212(3) \u03b3 d\u03be 1 d\u03be 2 d\u03be 3 ,\n(III.7)\nI\u2212 = \u2212M\n\u03a33\u2212\n\nHere (3) \u03b3 is the determinant of the induced metric on the\nworldsheet \u03b3rs = \u2202r y \u03bc \u2202s y\u03bc , with \u2202r = \u2202/\u2202\u03be r .\nB.\n\nEquations of motion and Dirac veto\n\nWe will now proceed to demand that the action (III.4)\nbe stationary with respect to variations of the potential A, of the particle worldlines wi (\u03c4 ), and of the complete three dimensional worldsheet y(\u03be), which includes\nthe Dirac string of the magnetic event and the newly\nintroduced dynamical extended object.\nUpon variation of the potential A, we find\n\n(III.5)\n\nFor each charged particle, the kinetic action is proportional to its worldlength,\nZ q\nX\nIparticles = \u2212\nmi\n\u2212\u1e87i\u03bc \u1e87i\u03bc d\u03c4,\n(III.6)\ni\n\n\u03a3\u2212\n\n1\nd\u2217 F + \u03b1F \u2227 F = \u2217 jparticles + \u2217 j\u2212 ,\n2\n\n(III.8)\n\nwith,\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\n(x)\n\nZ\n= \u03b1g\n\u03a33\u2212\n\n\u03b4 (5) (x \u2212 y)F \u2227 dy \u03bc\n\n(III.9)\n\n\f5\nWe also recall that it follows from the definition (II.4) of\nF that\ndF = \u2217 jmag\n\n(III.10)\n\nNext, upon variation of the wi\u03bc (\u03c4 ), we find that each\ncharged particle couples to the 1-form A through the\nLorenz force law,\nmi \u1e85i \u03bc = qi F \u03bc\u03bd \u1e87i\u03bd ,\n\n(III.11)\n\nwhereas, upon variation of the yi\u03bc (\u03be) for \u03be 3 < 0, we find\nthat the extended charged object couples to A according\nto,\nM \u0003y \u03bc (\u03be) = (\u03b1g)\u000frst (\u2212\u03b3)\u22121/2 F \u03bcr Fst\n\n(III.12)\n\nNow we compute the variation of the action with respect\nto yi\u03bc (\u03be) for \u03be 3 > 0 (Dirac string). The variation of the\nDirac string, \u03b4y may be defined choosing a four dimensional manifold whose boundary is the union of the original and the varied Dirac world-volumes, y \u03bc and y \u03bc +\u03b4y \u03bc .\nThis manifold has an associated current \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 , satisfying,\nd\u2217 \u0393 = \u03b4 \u2217 G+\n\n(III.13)\n\nWe use this last expression to write the variation of the\naction with respect to the Dirac string,\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b1\n\u03b4I =\nd\u2217 F + dA \u2227 dA \u2227 \u2217 \u0393,\n(III.14)\n2\nMaking use of Eq. (III.8) we see that the variation\n(III.14) vanish automatically provided that (i) the three\ndimensional worldsheet of the Dirac string cannot be\ncrossed by an electric current, (ii) the Dirac string should\nnot intersect with itself. If there are several magnetic\nsources one finds, in the same way, that their Dirac\nstrings cannot intersect with each other. This is the\nDirac veto, which due to the presence of the ChernSimons coupling takes a stronger form than for the pure\nMaxwell case. This strengthening of the Dirac veto does\nnot yield any new quantization condition but, without it,\nEqs. (III.8)-(III.12) do not follow from an action principle.\nIn this context, it is of interest to observe that an important property already found in Ref. [6] for D = 3,\nalso holds here. The property is the following: although,\nat any given time, the individual electric charge of each\ncharged object (point or extended) is well defined, and\ntherefore so it is the total charge, there is no unambiguous notion of charge density in space. This is due to the\nfact that the density of electric charge appearing on the\nright side of the Gauss law is not the one on the right\nside of (III.8), but rather, the one obtained by replacing\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\nin that equation by\nZ\n\u03bc\nj (x) = \u03b1g\n\u03b4 (5) (x \u2212 y)dA \u2227 dy \u03bc .\n(III.15)\n\u03a33\n\nNow, this j \u03bc is conserved and invariant under A \u2192 A +\nd\u039b, but, unlike j \u03bc , it changes if one displaces the string\nworldsheet piece of it coming from \u03a33+ . For example, one\nmay make \u03a33+ to cross any x0 =constant surface back\nand forth in time, thus changing the amount of charge\npresent within any space volume. On the other hand, the\ncharges of the emitted object are unambiguous because\nof the Dirac veto, which forbids putting a Dirac string\non top of them. See in this context also [10].\nC.\n\nEmission of electric charge by a magnetic source\n\nIf we look at the right hand side of (III.8) we observe\n\u03bc\nthat the current j\u2212\ngiven by (III.9) appears on the same\nfooting with the electric current of the particles. Unlike\n\u03bc\nthe current of the particles, the current j\u2212\nhas its support\non the semi-infinite three dimensional surface \u03a33\u2212 , and,\nmore importantly, it is not conserved. Indeed, by direct\ncalculation from (III.9) one finds\nZ\n\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bd j\u2212 (x) = \u2212\u03b1g \u03b4 (5) (x \u2212 z)F (z)\n(III.16)\nwhere z(\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 ) is the magnetic event.\nEq. (III.16) makes the exterior derivative of Eq (III.8)\nto be an identity. This consistency requirement is actually what motivated the introduction in the action of\nthe complete \u03a33 , including \u03a33\u2212 , in addition to the Dirac\nstring \u03a33+ required by the magnetic event.\nIf one has several magnetic events zi with magnetic\ncharges gi , one replaces Eq. (III.16) by\nX Z\n\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bd j\u2212\n(x) = \u2212\u03b1\ngi \u03b4 (5) (x \u2212 zi )F (zi )\n(III.17)\ni\n\nIf we take the integral of (III.17) over a five dimensional volume which contains the magnetic event, we obtain that a magnetic event of magnetic charge g emits an\nelectric charge Q given by\nZ\nQemitted = \u2212\u03b1g\nF (z) (D = 5).\n(III.18)\nevent\n\nThere is an important difference with the case p = 1,\nD = 3. There, the 2-form F is absent in the analog\nof (III.9), and therefore the electric charge emitted by a\nparticular magnetic source is totally determined by that\nsource itself, and it is always equal to \u2212\u03b1g. However,\nas seen from Eq. (III.18), for D = 5 one already sees a\nmore general new effect: the electric charge emitted by\na magnetic source depends also on the value of the total\nelectromagnetic field, and therefore on the other sources.\nThe term \"induced emission\" would appear appropriate\nto describe this phenomenon.\nA consequence of the induced character of the emission\nof charge, which, again, is not present for D = 3 is that\nthe electric current (III.9) may vanish. Then the emitted\nobject is still present but it is electrically neutral. This\n\n\f6\nhappens most strikingly when the projection Frs of F on\n\u03a33 vanishes. In that case there is no driving force on the\nright hand side of (III.12) and the emitted object moves\nas a free two dimensional Nambu string.\nWe stress again that, as it was pointed out in [1], the\npresent description should be considered as just an effective theory because it cannot properly account for the\ndetailed mechanism of the impact and of the associated\nenergy momentum conservation. Therefore, the boundary conditions are not determined, and one must make a\nchoice for which solution of the field equation of motion is\nto be taken. It was argued in [1] that, at least at the classical level, a natural solution corresponding for a confined\nflux impinging from the past was the purely retarded one,\nand we will adhere to that practice below. For the same\nreason the boundary conditions for the emitted physical\nobject are not fully determined. Its initial position is the\nmagnetic event, but its initial velocity (or final position)\nhas to be specified. This freedom will be used in Secs.\nIV and V to choose particular configurations.\n\nIV.\n\nQUANTIZATION OF THE CHERN-SIMONS\nCOUPLING FOR D = 5 AND p = 1\n\nIn this section, we will generalize the approach that\nwas used in [6] to obtain the quantization of the ChernSimons coupling. There, we evaluated the charge Q emitted by a single event and demanded that it be quantized\naccording to the general rule (II.11). The charge turned\nout to be\nQ = \u2212\u03b1 g\n\n(D = 3),\n\n(IV.1)\n\nand therefore the quantum of coupling turned out to be\n\u03b1g 2 = \u03c0~\n\n(D = 3).\n\n(IV.2)\n\nWe will see below that for D = 5, the charge emitted by a single magnetic source vanishes and therefore a\nmore elaborate configuration needs to be used in order to\nderive the quantization rule for \u03b1. The simplest configuration that we have found is a \"composite event\" that\nconsists of two magnetic sources which are complementary and do not cross each other. One might take one\nof the sources to be the history of an ordinary extended\nmagnetic pole, but the other one would necessarily have\nto be a spacelike extended magnetic event. Thus, spacelike events are essential to the procedure. Since one must\nhave at least one of them, the configuration that we will\nstudy consists of two spacelike events, in order to make\nthe computation more symmetric.\n\nthis event, the only non-vanishing component of the magnetic current is\n34\njA,mag\n= g\u03b4(x0 )\u03b4(x1 )\u03b4(x2 ).\n\nNow, due to the translational and rotational symmetry\nof the sources in the (x3 , x4 )-plane, the problem will be\nreduced to one in three dimensions (x0 , x1 , x2 ) with a\npoint source at the origin. The only non-vanishing components of the field strength F produced by the source\n(IV.3), i.e., its self-field, are given by\nA\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\ng \u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 x\u03c1\n\u03b8(\u2212R2 )\u03b8(x0 ).\n2\u03c0 (\u2212R2 ) 23\n\nField of a single magnetic event\n\nTake an event A, with magnetic charge g, whose world\nvolume is the (x3 , x4 )-plane at x0 = x1 = x2 = 0. For\n\n(IV.4)\n\nHere, all the indices are referred to the effective threedimensional spacetime with coordinates x0 , x1 , x2 ; R2 is\nthe invariant spacetime distance from the effective point\nsource at the origin,\nR 2 = \u2212 x0\n\n\u00012\n\n+ x1\n\n\u00012\n\n+ x2\n\n\u00012\n\n,\n\n(IV.5)\n\nand we have taken, just as in [1], the retarded solution.\nThe field (IV.5) is the retarded field of a pure Maxwell\nmagnetic pole for D = 3. It turns out to be an exact solution of the full Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations (III.8)\nfor D = 5 because it obeys F \u2227 F = 0 (this does not\nhappen for D = 3!).\nSince the field (IV.5) is transverse to the magnetic\nevent, it has no projection on it. As discussed above\n\u03bc\nthis implies that the current j\u2212\nin (III.9) vanishes. This\nmeans that the emitted object (which in this case is absorbed, rather) is neutral and moves as a free two dimensional Nambu string. Note that the argument is purely\nalgebraic based on the symmetry of the problem so that\nthe singularity in the self-field cannot contribute to the\nintegrand in the expression (III.18) for Q. The fact that\nthe total charge produced by the self-field of the event is\nzero makes the above configuration not useful to obtain\na quantization condition.\nB.\n\nField of a composite magnetic event\n\nWe will now consider a composite two-dimensional\nevent which consists of two complementary spacelike\nevents A, B separated in time.\nThe event A will be the one already discussed. The\nadditional event B will have charge \u2212g and it will be\nlocated at the complementary (x1 , x2 )-plane at a later\ntime x0 = a > 0, so that the equations describing event\nB are x0 = a, x3 = 0, x4 = 0 and the magnetic current is\n12\njB,mag\n= \u2212g\u03b4(x0 \u2212 a)\u03b4(x3 )\u03b4(x4 ).\n\nA.\n\n(IV.3)\n\n(IV.6)\n\nThe geometrical configuration in consideration may be\ndescribed as follows. An electric object comes in and\nends on the magnetic event A. The magnetic event A, in\nturn, emits a Dirac membrane that is next absorbed by\n\n\f7\nevent B, which finally proceeds to emit another electric\nobject. This configuration is illustrated in Fig. 2. It\nconsists of two dark patches connected by a shaded patch\nin between.\n\nan electric charge\nZ\nQB = \u03b1g\nx0 =a\n\n(IV.7)\n\nA\nNow, if we take for F12\nthe expression given by (IV.4)\nwe find that the integral diverges. However, these divergency is spurious and it is actually due to the point\ncharacter of the source in the present effective theory.\nIndeed, the field (IV.4) obeys, in the three dimensional\nspace of (x0 , x1 , x2 ),\n\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\n\ufffd= 0\n\n\u2217\n\nB\n\nA\n\ng\n\nA\ndx1 dx2 F12\n.\n\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\n=0\n\nMonday, August 8, 2011\n\nFIG. 2: The surface \u03a3 for D = 5. The surface shown in Fig.\n1 contains only one magnetic event. One may extend the\nnotion to a surface \u03a3 that contains two magnetic events by\ncombining pieces as shown. A neutral electric object (dark)\ncomes in and ends on the magnetic event A. The magnetic\nevent A, in turn, emits a Dirac membrane (shaded) that is\nnext absorbed by event B, which finally proceeds to emit a\ncharged electric object (dark).\n\nWhen proceeding from event A to event B, the Dirac\nstring goes up in time while turning, describing a sort of\nsmooth staircase, i.e., a slide. The first stage, event A,\nis the (x3 , x4 )-plane at x0 = x1 = x2 = 0 and the second stage, event B, is the (x1 , x2 )-plane at x0 = a, x3 =\n0, x4 = 0.\nWe will take again retarded boundary conditions. The\nretarded field F ret is given by the pure Maxwell solution\n(IV.4) up to B but takes a different form to the future\nof it. This is because the non-linear Chern-Simons terms\ncome in for x0 > a. The calculation that follows will not\ninvolve the field after event B.\nThe total electric charge emitted by the composite\nmagnetic event is the sum of the those emitted by A\nand B. Since the fields are retarded, the object incoming from the past into event A is neutral, and therefore\nthat event does not emit (or rather, absorb) any charge.\nOn the other hand, the event B is 'illuminated\" by the\nretarded field of A and, furthermore, due to the turning\nof the staircase, the illumination induces the emission of\n\ndF = g\u03b4 (3) (x).\n\n(IV.8)\n\nTherefore, if we close the plane x0 = a by adding to it\na timelike cylinder at infinity, and another plane parallel\nto B at negative x0 , we find, by applying Stokes' formula\nto (IV.8),\nQB = \u03b1g 2 .\n\n(IV.9)\n\nSince the field is retarded, the cylinder and the lower\nplane do not contribute to the integral.\nNote that the result is independent of the time separation a > 0 between events A and B, as one could have\nanticipated on dimensional grounds. This is an evidence\nof the topological nature of the charge emission process,\nwhich is elaborated upon in the next subsection.\nThe point, of course, is that in order to apply Stokes'\nformula, one needs to regularize the field F\u03bc\u03bd on the\nlightcone, for example, in the manner illustrated in Fig.\n3. However, the result (IV.9) should be independent of\nthe details of the regularization, because any smearing of\nthe delta-function source in (IV.8) (which should be automatically implemented in an underlying non-effective\ntheory) would preserve Gauss' law. The regularization\nof the charge density is illustrated in Fig 3.\nIf we apply the general quantization rule (II.11) for the\nproduct of the electric and magnetic charges to QB given\nby (IV.9) we conclude that the Chern-Simons coupling\nmust be quantized according to\n\u03b1g 3 = 2\u03c0m~\n\n(D = 5)\n\n(IV.10)\n\nThis result was previously obtained in [8] using dimensional reduction and the Witten effect in four spacetime\ndimensions, namely the acquisition of electric charge in\nthe presence of a topological \u03b8-term.\nIt is important to realize that the quantization rule for\nthe product of electric and magnetic charges needs that\nthe Dirac string should be able to trace a surface which\nincludes all the electric charge, which will be subject to\nquantization, without violating the Dirac veto. In the\ncase at hand, although the electric object is infinitely\nextended in space, and cannot be enclosed by a three\ndimensional surface, the density of electric charge is effectively confined to a disk (2-ball) within the lightcone of\nevent A, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Therefore, provided that\nthe Dirac string remains outside of that ball, the standard quantization argument applies straightforwardly.\n\n\f8\n\nx0\nOriginal\nGreen function\n\nRegularized\nGreen function\n\nx0 = a\n\nMagnetic Event\nB\n\nLightcone\n\nx\n\n1\n\nMagnetic Event\nA\n\nFIG. 3: Regularization of the retarded field. The figure depicts the magnetic events A and B, located at x0 = x1 = x2 =\n0 and x0 = a, x3 = x4 = 0 respectively. A section along the\n(x0 , x1 ) plane at x3 = x4 = 0 is shown. The event A is a point\nat the origin of this section. The profiles of the retarded field\nF12 on the event B before and after regularization. The original field is non-vanishing inside its future lightcone only, but\ndiverges on it. After regularization, which may be thought\nof as the smearing of event A, the field becomes finite on the\nlightcone, but has a rapidly decaying tail outside of it.\n\nC.\n\nEmitted charge as Chern class\n\nThe electric charge emitted by the composite magnetic\nevent admits a simple geometrical description. As it was\npointed out in the previous subsection, in order to regularize the emitted charge, it was natural to bring in a\nclosed surface that completed the last magnetic event so\nas to link the first one. Actually, since the self-field of the\nsecond event does not contribute to the integral over it,\none may take the upper face of the closed surface to lie\nbelow the second event. This brings out more clearly the\nfact that the key geometrical aspect is to link the first\nevent. Thus, we might rewrite (IV.7),\nI\nQemitted = QB = \u03b1g\nF,\n(IV.11)\n2\n\u03c3A\n\n2\nwher \u03c3A\nis a closed surface that links event A.\n2\nThe form F is closed on \u03c3A\n. This is because there\n2\nare no magnetic events on \u03c3A , except event B, which is\ntangent to it so that the projection of Eq. (III.10) on\n2\n\u03c3A\nreduces to dF = 0. Therefore, one may arbitrarily\n2\ndeform \u03c3A\nbelow B provided it still links A.\n2\nAlthough closed, the 2-form F is not exact on \u03c3A\nbecause its integral over it is different from zero as shown\nby (IV.9). As a result of the presence of the magnetic\nevents, the connection A is defined through local patches\n2\non \u03c3A\n. If the events are properly chosen so as to generate the complete D = 5 spacetime, a global connection\nhas a non-vanishing Chern class, which is related to the\n\nemitted charge by (IV.11) and is quantized according to\n(IV.9).\nWe have used, for simplicity, the retarded field for\neach individual event. If one where to consider the timereversed situation, the retarded field would be replaced\nby the advanced field and the charged membrane would\nbe emitted towards the past out of event A. One would\nthen have\nI\nQemitted = QA = \u2212\u03b1g\nF,\n(IV.12)\n2\n\u03c3B\n\n2\nwhere \u03c3B\nnow links event B.\nThe question naturally arises as to whether one could\nwrite Qemitted as an integral over a surface \u03c3 2 which\nwould not have to be chosen according to the boundary condition for the field. We differ this issue to future\ninvestigations.\nOne is familiar with the change in topology in nonabelian gauge theories, when an instanton (solution of\nthe Euclidean field equations) is present in between the\nremote past and the distant future. In that case the\ntopology change is due to quantum mechanical tunneling. Here, we may also view the charge emission process as one that changes\nR theH topology in the sense that\nthe winding number F = \u221e A changes. However, in\ncontradistinction with the instanton case, the change in\ntopology is due to the presence of a (composite) magnetic event in Lorenzian spacetime. It is not connected\nto quantum mechanical tunneling but already goes classically.\n\nV.\nA.\n\nHIGHER D AND p\np = 1 for any (odd) D\n\nThe image of a slide going up in time and turning that\narose for D = 5 suggests an obvious generalization for\nhigher dimensions.\nFor D = 7, in which case the magnetic events are fourdimensional, one adds a third elementary event C, which\nemits a physical object with electric charge Q 6= 0. Just\nas before the retarded solution is exact all the way from\n\u2212\u221e to tC .\nWhile the turning staircase goes up, the following\nsteps, illustrated in Fig. 4, occur: (i) A Dirac membrane\n(shaded) comes in from the past and it is absorbed by a\nmagnetic event A with charge \u2212g. (ii) A physical membrane is emitted by A. This intermediate physical object\nis neutral, due to the lack of sufficient illumination. It\nmoves towards the future as a free Nambu membrane\n(the \"Lorentz force\" on the right side of (III.12) vanishes). (iii) Another neutral physical membrane comes\nin from the past of event B, which has charge g. Note\nthat there is no danger of these neutral membranes to\nviolate the Dirac veto because they do not carry an electric current. (iv) A Dirac membrane (shaded) is emitted\n\n\f9\nby B and absorded by C, of charge \u2212g. (v) A physical\nobject (dark) is emitted by C.\nIt would have been nice to take the physical membrane\nabsorbed by B to be the one emitted by A. This would\nhave been permissible for a Dirac string which is physically unobservable, but it cannot be done for a physical\nmembrane because it would have to move faster than\nlight at sufficiently large distances.\n\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\n\ufffd= 0\n\nC\nB\n\ng\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\n=0\n\n\u03bc\nj\u2212\n=0\n\nA\n\nMonday, August 8, 2011\n\nFIG. 4: The surface \u03a3 for D = 7. It consists of two disconnected pieces, one of the type shown in Fig. 1 for a single\nmagnetic event, and another of the type shown in Fig. 2 for\na sequence of two magnetic events. The two pieces cannot be\njoined to form a single connected surface because the neutral\nelectric object emitted by A cannot be absorbed by B without exceeding the speed of light. This is why a void is left\nin the figure between the physical neutral membranes emitted\nby A and absorbed by B, respectively. That problem does not\narise for Dirac membranes which are physically unobservable.\nHence, one can safely connect B and C as shown.\n\nNext one observes that again it is only the last event\nC that is sufficiently illuminated (by both A and B) to\nhave a non-vanishing emitted charge Q.\nOne finds for the charge emitted at the last event C\nthe value,\nZ\n\u03b1g\nQemitted =\nF \u2227 F (D = 7),\n(V.1)\n2 C\nwhich is the analog of (III.18).\nThis integral breaks up as a product\nZ\nZ\n1\n2 A\nB\nQemitted = \u03b1g dx dx F12 dx3 dx4 F34\n.\n\none has the value \u2212g, the second one has the value +g.\nHence, the emitted charge Qemitted is given by\nQemitted = \u2212\u03b1g 3 .\n\nIt is also possible in this case to express the emitted charge by replacing event C as the region of integration in (V.1) by a closed surface \u03c34 lying below\nit. The closed surface \u03c34 maybe constructed as follows.\nIf one imagines events A,B and C as parts of a staircase spiriling upwards, one takes another staircase which\nturns, say, slightly faster. This new staircase is taken\nto start earlier than A and to end before C. The intersections of events A and B with the initial staircase\nare four-dimensional. In contradistinction, their intersections with the faster turning staircase are \"generic\",\ni.e. are connected two-dimensional infinite surfaces. The\nsurface \u03c34 is the boundary of the faster turning staircase,\nincluding the boundary at infinity.\nJust as before, the piece at infinity is not sufficiently\nilluminated and it does not contribute to the integral.\nNeither does the bottom plane since the fields are retarded. Thus one can rewrite (V.1) as\nI\n\u03b1g\nQemitted =\nF \u2227 F (D = 7),\n(V.4)\n2 \u03c34\nFor D = 5, the intersection of event A with the corresponding faster turning staircase, which can be continuously deformed to any three-dimensional surface bounded\nby the surface \u03c32 used there, is a point, and therefore the\nlinking number appears. For D = 7, what appears is an\ninteresting extension of the latter notion.\nNote that by using Stokes theorem and (III.10), one\nmay go down the staircase, rewrite (V.1) as,\n!\nI\nQemitted = \u03b1g 2\n\nF\n\nEach of the two-dimensional integrals appearing in (V.2)\nis of the type already discussed for D = 5, the first\n\n,\n\n(V.5)\n\n2\n\u03c3A\n\nand appeal to (IV.11) to recover (V.3).\nDemanding that Q be quantized according to Dirac's\nrule, yields the quantization of the Chern-Simons coupling\n\u03b1g 4 = 2\u03c0~m\n\n(D = 7)\n\n(V.6)\n\nFor p = 1 and D = 2n + 1, the staircase has dimension\n2n \u2212 1 and contains n magnetic events Ei of dimension\n2n \u2212 2 and magnetic charges of alternating signs. The\nlast event En has magnetic charge \u2212g.\nOne finds that only the last event En is sufficiently\nilluminated and emits a charge,\nZ\n\u03b1g\nQemitted =\nF \u2227 *{z\n* * \u2227 F} = \u03b1 g n .\n(V.7)\n(n \u2212 1)!

In this case,\nthe role that charged particles played for p = 1 is played\nby extended objects of worldvolume dimension p, while\nthe corresponding dimensions of the magnetic event and\nthe emitted electric object are D \u2212 p \u2212 2 and D \u2212 p \u2212 1,\nrespectively [4].\nIn particular for the interesting case p = 3, D = 11,\nwhich arises in supergravity, the Chern-Simons action\nreads\nZ\nZ\n\u03b1g\n\u03b1\ndA \u2227 dA \u2227 A +\ndA \u2227 A.\n(V.10)\nICS =\n6\n2 \u03a37\nwhich is of the same form as the one for p = 1, D = 5\nand therefore the coupling is now quantized as\n\u03b1g 3 = 2\u03c0~m.\n\n(V.11)\n\nSince for p=3, D = 11, the point particles of p = 1,\nD = 5 are replaced by two dimensional extended objects,\nthe analog of the composite event discussed in subsection\nIV B would consist of two six-dimensional events separated by a three-dimensional slab (instead of the one dimensional time axis interval). Thus, one could take event\nA to have the equations x0 = 0; x3 = x4 = x5 = x6 = 0\nand event B to be defined by x0 = a; x7 = x8 = x9 =\nx10 = 0. The joining slab would then have 0 < x0 < a,\n\u2212\u221e < x1 , x2 < +\u221e.\nFor p 6= 1, athough there is an underlying U (1)\ngauge invariance, the corresponding electric and magnetic charges are not those of ordinary Maxwell theory.\nThe conserved electric current is not the dual of (D \u2212 1)form but rather the dual of a (D\u2212p)-form and the charge\nis computed by integration of the dual of the current over\na (D \u2212 p) submanifold [11].\nVI.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nRecently, the concept of extended charged events has\nbeen introduced, and it has been argued, on the basis\n\nof the principle of electric-magnetic duality, that events\nshould play as central a role as that played by particles or\nordinary branes. In this article we show that in the presence of a Chern-Simons coupling, a magnetically charged\nextended event emits an extended physical object which\nmay be electrically charged, and we write an action principle which accounts for this effect. The action involves\ntwo Chern-Simons terms, one integrated over spacetime,\nand another integrated over the submanifold obtained by\njoining the history of the emitted physical object and the\nworldsheet of the Dirac string of the magnetic event.\nBy demanding that the total emitted charge of a composite extended magnetic event be quantized according\nto Dirac's rule, we find a quantization condition for the\nChern-Simons coupling. For a 1-form electric potential\nin D = 2n + 1 spacetime dimensions, the composite object is formed by n extended magnetic events separated\nin time such that the product of their transverse spaces,\ntogether with the time axis, is the entire spacetime.\nOur procedure is a generalization of the one used in\nRef. [6] in D = 3. However, in D = 5 and higher, the\nproblem is much richer geometrically and presents, for\nexample, the novel phenomena of induced electric charge\nemission.\nFor the case D = 11, p = 3, our result for the quantization of the Chern-Simons coupling was obtained previously in [8, 14\u201317] in the context of M-theory (i.e.\nthrough the use of a combination of results from 11dimensional supergravity and string theory). One cannot\nhelp feeling that this agreement is remarkable and makes\nthe existence of events even more compelling since Mtheory is ready to accomodate them.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Constantin Bachas for many\nilluminating discussions on charged events, and Cristi\u00e1n\nMart\u0131\u0301nez for much help in the preparation of the\nmanuscript.
