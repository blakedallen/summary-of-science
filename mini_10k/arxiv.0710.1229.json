In this article we demonstrate that\nlocalized forces, applied for example by a photon pressure actuator, can result in a\nnon-negligible elastic deformation of the test masses. For a photon pressure actuator\nsetup used in the gravitational wave detector GEO 600 we measured that this effect\nmodifies the standard response function by 10 % at 1 kHz and about 100 % at 2.5 kHz.\n\nPACS numbers: 04.80.Nn, 95.75.Kk\n\n1. Introduction\nThe currently operating laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors GEO 600 [1],\nVirgo [2], LIGO [3] and TAMA300 [4] are using cylindrical test masses made of fused\nsilica to probe changes in the metric originating from gravitational waves. Usually such\ntest masses are considered to behave as rigid bodies for any applied force.\nHowever, in this article we show that a non-uniformly distributed force acting on\na test mass can cause a significant deformation. We evaluate this effect quantitatively,\nusing the photon pressure actuator installed at the GEO 600 interferometer. Such a\nphoton pressure actuator was first demonstrated by Clubley et al [5] to be employed as\nan easy and independent method for displacement calibration of a gravitational-wave\ndetector.\n\n\fPhoton pressure induced test mass deformation in gravitational-wave detectors\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. Experimental arrangement for measurements with the photon pressure\nactuator. M: Far mirror in the north building of the GEO 600 detector. Illumination\nof this mirror with light from the laser diode produces a differential arm-length change\nthat is measured at the main output of the interferometer.\n\nFigure 1 shows a diagram of the the experimental setup of the photon pressure\nactuator in the GEO 600 detector. The light of a laser diode is collimated by a lens, L,\nand enters the vacuum system via a viewport, before it is impinging on one of the main\nmirrors, M. More detailed descriptions of the setup can be found in [6] and [7].\nIn Section 2 we calculate the expected test mass deformation induced by the photon\npressure using three different methods. A 2-Dimensional and a 3-Dimensional finite\nelement analyses are performed as well as an analytical estimation. The corresponding\ndisplacement sensed by the gravitational wave detector is evaluated in Section 3 using a\nsimple model. A prediction is made of how the response to the photon actuator changes\nwhen the test mass deformation effect is taken into account. The presence of the test\nmass deformation is experimentally confirmed by measurements presented in Section 4.\n2. Models used to calculate the test mass deformation\nIn order to evaluate the effect from any test mass deformation introduced by photon\npressure, we have to calculate the actual deformation caused by the setup of the GEO\nphoton pressure actuator.

Radial profile of the test mass deformation originating from a force\ncontinuously applied with a gaussian distribution over a radius of 2.5 mm around the\ncenter of the test mass. For the analysis a GEO 600 standard test mass was used\n(18 cm diameter, 10 cm thickness, made of fused silica (Suprasil)). Shown are the\nresults of two finite element analysis. The result produced by the ANSYS software\nis represented by the blue dashed-dotted line, while the COMSOL software produced\nthe orange dashed line. An analytical calculation is indicated by the solid green line.\nThe corresponding effective displacements (see table 2) agree within 10 % for all three\nresults (Explanation is given in the text.).\n\nAltogether we compared three different ways to calculate the mirror deformation:\nTwo finite element analyses have been performed in addition to a (quasi-)analytical\ncalculation. The following list gives a short description of each of the methods applied:\n\u2022 ANSYS: Ansys is a well known finite element software package [8]. The 3Dimensional model consisted of about 42000 elements. A non homogenous mashing\nwas chosen, employing a very dense meshing in the center of the test mass in order\nto resolve the maximum of the deformation.\n\u2022 Comsol: Comsol Multiphysics [9] is also a widely used finite element analysis\nsoftware package. The deformation of the cross-section of the test mass was\nanalyzed by performing a 2-Dimensional simulation.\n\u2022 Analytical: The analytical calculation is based on an algorithm developed by\nBondu, Hello and Vinet [10] for the calculation of thermo-elastic noise in an infinite\nhalf plane mirror. In addition our calculation includes corrections and extensions\nfrom Liu and Thorne [11].\nFigure 2 shows the radial profile of the calculated displacement of the test mass\nsurface, D(r). The three methods agree pretty well over the full radius of the test mass.\n\n\f4\n\nPhoton pressure induced test mass deformation in gravitational-wave detectors\n\nThe effective displacement actually measured by the interferometer, Dtotal , is\ndetermined by the overlap of the mirror deformation and the main interferometer beam,\nwhich can be described by a gaussian beam. The radial intensity of the interferometer\nbeam, I(r), is given by\n\u22122r 2\nI(r) = exp\n\u03c92\n\n!\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = 25 mm is the radius of the beam. Each point on the mirror surfaces\ncontributes to the total effective displacement, Dtotal , weighted by the product of the\npower of the main interferometer beam, I(r), and the corresponding displacement D(r)\u2021.\nFor a radially symmetric setup, as described above, the total effective displacement can\nbe expressed by a single integral:\nDtotal =\n\n0.09m\nZ Z2\u03c0\n0\n\nDeff * r * dr * d\u03c6 =\n\n0\n\n0.09m\nZ\n\n2\u03c0 * r * kI * I(r) * D(r) * dr.\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nThe factor kI is a normalization factor for I(r) in order to give\n0.09m\nZ\n\n2\u03c0 * r * kI * I(r) * dr = 1.\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nUsing Equation 2 the total effective displacement for all three calculated test mass\ndeformations can be derived. The corresponding results are displayed in the second\ncolumn of table 2.

Predicted effect of the photon pressure induced test mass deformation\nThe previous section showed that the test masses are not completely rigid and that\nthe photon pressure actuator beam really causes a non-negligible deformation.

Simple model for the photon pressure calibrator taking into account the\nresponses from the pendulum and from the mirror deformation effect (analytical).\nThe pendulum response follows a 1/f 2 -law and is 180 degrees out of phase from\nphoton pressure excitation. The mirror deformation has a flat response and is in\nphase with photon pressure actuation. If both responses are added a notch appears\nat the frequency where both responses have equal size. The purple trace shows the\nexpected discrepancy between the calibrations with and without accounting for the\ntest mass deformation.\n\ntest mass is, compared to the displacement of the center of mass (originating from the\npendulum response). Since both responses are linear in the applied light power of the\nphoton pressure actuator we can simply compare their responses.\nThe pendulum response, \u03b1pen , follows a 1/f 2 -law, has a magnitude of 5 * 10\u22127 m/N\nat 100 Hz and is 180 degrees out of phase with the light power modulation (see blue\ndashed trace Figure 3)\u00a7. The response of the mirror deformation, \u03b1def , is assumed to\nbe flat in frequency and in phase with the modulated light power for frequencies below\nthe first internal resonances of the test mass, which in the case of a GEO test mass, has\na frequency of roughly 11 kHz [12]. In the previous Section effective displacements in\n\u00a7 Due to the fact that we are only interested in frequencies far above the resonance of the pendulum\nwhich is around 1 Hz, excitation and pendulum motion have opposite phase.\n\n\fPhoton pressure induced test mass deformation in gravitational-wave detectors\n\n6\n\nthe range 3.54 to 3.83 \u00d7 10\u221210 m/N were found. The magnitude and phase of \u03b1def from\nthe analytical test mass deformation is shown by the red dashed-dotted trace in Figure\n3. The total response, \u03b1total , plotted in green (solid) is the sum of the two individual\nresponses:\n\u03b1total = \u03b1pen + \u03b1def .\n\n(4)\n\nThe total response shows a steep notch at the frequency where the individual responses\nhave the same magnitude and compensate each other completely due to having opposite\nphase. At the frequency of the notch the phase of \u03b1total jumps from -180 to 0 degrees.\nThe modelled notch frequencies for the three different methods are displayed in the third\ncolumn of Table 2. The resulting discrepancy between the photon pressure actuator\nresponse without and with test mass deformation, is shown in the lowest subplot of\nFigure 3. Already at 1 kHz the test mass deformation causes an effect of 10 %. At 2 kHz\nthe error, when not taking the test mass deformation into account, amounts to 40 %\nand between 2.6 kHz and 4.6 kHz the discrepancy is larger than 100 %.\n4. Measurement of the photon pressure induced test mass deformation\nIn order to varify this model we injected signals to the photon pressure actuator over\na wide frequency range including frequencies as high as 6 kHz to be able to resolve\nany potential notch structure. The measurements presented here include long duration\nmeasurements to achieve reasonable snr at high frequencies. Individual measurement\npoints are made of single discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) containing up to 10 hours\nof data. Such amounts of data are difficult to handle with standard computers. A\nheterodyne technique was employed to reduce the volume of data. The time series of\nthe data containing the signal of interest, Esig * sin(\u03c9sig t), is multiplied by a sine wave\nwith a slightly lower frequency, \u03c9het :\n1\nEsig *sin(\u03c9sig t)*sin(\u03c9het t) = Esig [cos(\u03c9sig \u2212\u03c9het )t\u2212cos(\u03c9sig +\u03c9het )t](5)\n2\nThe second term on the right hand side of Equation 5 still contains the signal, but\nshifted towards even higher frequencies. The signal component we are interested in is\nshifted to a very low frequency, (\u03c9sig \u2212 \u03c9het ), which for our investigations was chosen\nto be 9 Hz. After heterodyning, the data stream is strongly low pass filtered and down\nsampled to give a data stream that can be handled by desktop computers. Figure 4\nshows the result of these measurements. The pink dashed line represents the photon\npressure actuator response without taking test mass deformation into account, while the\ngreen solid line indicates the photon pressure actuator response taking the test mass\ndeformation into account. The actual measurement of the response is displayed by the\nblue circles.\nThe presence of the expected notch structure and by this the non rigidity of the\ntest masses in the detection band of the gravitational wave is clearly confirmed by the\nmeasurement.

At 5 kHz the measurement matches the\npendulum response and finally at 6 kHz the measured response clearly exceeds the 1/f 2\nbehavior of the pendulum response. Around the notch frequency, the phase of the\nphoton pressure actuator response also changes significantly from about -165 degrees at\n2.8 kHz to about -30 degrees at 4.8 kHz. A phase of nearly 0 degree at high frequencies\nclearly indicates that the total response of the system is no longer dominated by the\npendulum response.\nIt can be seen that the notch is smeared out in the experimental data. This\noriginates from beam jitter of the main interferometer beam resulting in a varying\noverlap of the main interferometer beam and deformed test mass. Different overlaps\n\n\fPhoton pressure induced test mass deformation in gravitational-wave detectors\n\n8\n\ncorrespond to different effective displacements\nDtotal = r * kI\n\n0.09m\n360\nZ\nZ \u25e6\n0\n\n*I(r, \u03c6) * D(r, \u03c6) * dr * d\u03c6,\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwhich finally correspond to slightly shifted notch frequencies. Within the long\nmeasurement intervals of up to 10 hours the measurement averages over a variety of\nnotch frequencies resulting in a smeared out notch. A detailed description of this effect,\nincluding a quantitative analysis can be found in [7].\n5. Summary and Conclusions\nWe evaluated the deformation of a GEO 600 test mass caused by a narrow localized\nforce, applied by a photon pressure actuator using finite element models as well as a\nanalytical calculation. Based on these results we developed a simple model showing\nthat for frequencies above 1 kHz the test mass deformation has a non negligible effect\non the response of the photon pressure actuator. Actual measurements confirmed the\npredictions of our model, in particular around 3.8 kHz the presence of a notch structure\nin the photon pressure actuator response is clearly observed in the measurements.\nTest masses of the currently operating laser-interferometric gravitational wave\ndetectors cannot be considered to be rigid bodies for frequencies within the detection\nband. The effect of a test mass deformation needs to be taken into account when\nusing photon pressure actuation for high precision calibration of any gravitational wave\ndetector. Furthermore it should be mentioned that the actuation with widely used\ncoil-magnet actuators can potentionally lead to test mass deformation effects as well.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful for support from PPARC and the University of Glasgow in the\nUK, and the BMBF and the state of Lower Saxony in Germany.
