Many\nefforts have been devoted to understand this problem since then. See Refs. [2, 3] and references therein for details.\nRecently, Papenbrock and Weidenmueller considered fluctuations of and correlations between the J-dependent\nspectral widths [4, 5]. By using such correlations they were able to approximately evaluate spin I ground state\nprobabilities for six nucleons in a single-j (j = 19/2) shell under a two-body random ensemble (TBRE). Along this\nline, a very simple formula of the lowest energy of spin I states based on energy cenroid, spectral width and dimension\nof spin I states, was presented in Ref.[6] by the present authors. Our formula (see Eq. (12) of Ref. [6]) was shown\nto be applicable to evaluate statistically the lowest energy of spin I states, and proved to be very good in predicting\nspin I ground state probabilities calculated by using random two-body interactions. We should note that the idea of\nevaluating the lowest eigenvalue based on energy centroids and spectral widths was suggested by Ratcliff [7], Vary et\nal. [8], and by Zuker and his collaborators [9]. However, predicted results by formulas in Refs. [4, 5, 7, 8, 9] are less\naccurate than the formula in Ref. [6].\nEvaluation of the lowest eigenvalue is not only useful in studying regular structure of atomic nuclei in the presence\nof random interactions, but also a very common practice in many other fields. It is therefore the purpose of this\narticle to revisit empirical formulas of evaluating the lowest eigenvalues under random Hamiltonians. In this paper we\nshall also suggest other empirical formulas of evaluating the lowest eigenvalues of random Hamiltonians and random\nmatrices.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we review results of evaluating the lowest eigenvalues by using energy\ncentroids and width. It is found that the results of single-j shell and sd-boson systems follow the formula of Ref. [6]\n(except d bosons). In Sec. II we also improve such evaluations by adding higher moments for various systems. In Sec.\nIII we investigate other four lowest eigenvalues. In Sec. IV we concentrate on discussions of d bosons. The lowest\neigenvalues of random matrices are discussed in the Appendix.\nII.\n\nEMPIRICAL FORMULA OF REF. [6]\n\nIn this paper we take the same notations as our earlier work [6]. For fermions in a single-j shell\nb=\nH\n\n2j\u22121\nX\n\nJ=0,even\n\ni0\nh\n\u221a\neJ ,\n2J + 1GJ AJ\u2020 \u00d7 A\n\n(1)\n\neJ = \u2212 \u221a1 [e\nwith AJ\u2020 = \u221a12 [a\u2020j a\u2020j ]J and A\na e\na ]J . Two-body matrix elements GJ 's are assumed to follow the TBRE, i.e.,\n2 j j\nthey are a set of random numbers with a distribution function\n1\n\u03c1(GJ ) = \u221a exp(\u2212G2J /2), J = 0, 2, ..., 2j \u2212 1.\n2\u03c0\nb for spin-I states can be expressed in terms of coefficients of fractional parentage (cfp's):\nMatrix elements of H\nX\nb n I\u03b3i =\nHI\u03b2\u03b3 = hj n I\u03b2|H|j\n\u03b1JI\u03b2\u03b3 GJ .\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nJ\n\nOne can obtain eigenenergies of spin I states by diagonalizing HI\u03b2\u03b3 . Such definition can be easily generalized to\nmany-j shells without confusion.\nIn Ref. [6], a very simple formula of evaluating the lowest energy of HI was suggested as follows,\n(min)\n\nEI\n\n= \u0112I \u2212 \u03a6(dI )\u03c3I ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a6(dI ) = a ln dI + b, \u03c3I is the square root of the second order moment of eigenvalues of all spin I states, dI is\ndimension of spin I states, and a and b were determined empirically to be 0.99 and 0.36, respectively. This formula\nwas found to hold statistically.\nLet us first investigate fermion systems. We take four fermions in a j = 15/2 shell, four fermions in a j = 21/2\nshell, four fermions in a j = 31/2 shell, five fermions in a j = 19/2 shell, six fermions in a j = 17/2 shell, and four\n(min)\nfermions in a two-j (j = 7/2, 5/2) shell. The procedure is the same as in Ref. [6]; first, \u03a6(dI ) = [\u0112I \u2212 EI\n]/\u03c3I\nare calculated for 1000 runs of the TBRE, and second, we calculate the average of \u03a6(dI ) for these 1000 runs. We\n\n\f3\nplot (\u03a6(dI ))2 as a function of lndI in Fig. 1. One can see that (\u03a6(dI ))2 is close to linear correlation with ln(dI ) for\nall these examples. Parameters a and b obtained by this procedure in each example are shown in Table I. They are\nclose to those obtained in Ref. [6] (a = 0.99, b = 0.36). The results of sd bosons are similar to those of fermions in a\nsingle-j shell or two-j shells, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and Table II. We also investigate results of a more complicated\nsystem: three valence protons and three valence neutrons in the (2s1/2 , 1d3/2 , 0i11/2 ) shell, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n(b)\n\nI\n\nd)\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\nj=15/2; n=4\n\nn=5\n\nj=21/2; n=4\n\nn=6\n\nj=31/2; n=4\n\nn=7\n\nj=19/2; n=5\n\n1.5\n\nn=8\n\n1.5\n\nj=17/2; n=6\n\nn=9\n\nj=5/2,7/2; n=4\n\nn=12\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd ) =0.99ln(d )+0.36\nI\n\n1.5\n\nd ) =0.99ln(d )+0.36\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\nI\n\n3.0\n\nln(d )\nI\n\nFIG. 1.(Color online) Factor (\u03a6(dI ))2 versus ln (dI ) determined numerically for fermion and sd-boson systems.\n(a) fermion systems; (b) sd-boson systems.

However,\nit is not good enough for evaluation of the ground state energy in a reasonable precision. It is therefore desirable to\nimprove the formula of Ref. [6].\nTowards this goal, we consider higher orders of moment of the eigenenergies to compensate the deviation from\nGaussian distribution for eigenvalues.

According to the linear correlation between (\u03a6(dI )) and ln(dI ) shown in Fig. 4, the straight line\ncorresponding to ground states and that corresponding to excited states (e.g., the 1st excited states) seem to cut\nacross each other. Such an intersection does not occur, because the g.s. energy always corresponds a larger \u03a6 value.\n2\nIn other words, the linear correlation between (\u03a6(dI )) and ln(dI ) is valid when dI is smaller than 104 . For larger dI ,\nthe results should be further investigated.\n\nTABLE IV. a and b values for fermion systems and sd-boson systems with eigenvalues of the ground state and the\nfirst to the fourth excited states corresponding to Fig. 4, respectively.\nState\ng.s.\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\na 1.04 \u00b1 0.01 1.18 \u00b1 0.01 1.21 \u00b1 0.01 1.23 \u00b1 0.01 1.25 \u00b1 0.01\nb 0.30 \u00b1 0.03 \u22121.42 \u00b1 0.02 \u22122.14 \u00b1 0.03 \u22122.64 \u00b1 0.02 \u22123.03 \u00b1 0.02\n\nIV.\n\nD-BOSON SYSTEMS\n\nIn this Section we study very simple systems, d bosons, for which eigen-energies are linear combinations of two-body\nmatrix elements. The two-body Hamiltonian of a d-boson system is given by\nHd = H0 +\n\nX 1\u221a\nl\n\n2\n\ne l ]0 .\n2l + 1cl [(d\u2020 \u00d7 d\u2020 )l \u00d7 (de \u00d7 d)\n\n(7)\n\nFrom Eqs.(2.79) and (2.82) of Ref. [10], we have\nE=\n\nE0 +\n+\n\n1\n1\n(4c2 + 3c4 )nd (nd \u2212 1) + (7c0 \u2212 10c2 + 3c4 ) [nd (nd + 3) \u2212 \u03c5(\u03c5 + 3)]\n14\n70\n\n1\n(\u2212c2 + c4 ) [I(I + 1) \u2212 6nd ] .\n14\n\n(8)\n\nFor states with given I, the state with \u03c5 being maximum value or minimum (depending on the sign of \u03b2 \u2032 =\n\u2212 10c2 + 3c4 )) is the lowest among all eigenvalues.

There seems no simple relationship between \u03a6 and lndI .\nApparently, there is systematic deviation from linear correlation between [\u03a6(dI )]2 and ln (d). The value of \u03a6(dI )\nseems to saturate when the dimension goes to infinity.\n\n\f7\n\n1.8\n\n3.0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1.5\n\n)/2]\n\n2\n\n1.2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n(c)\n3\n\n+\n\n2\n\n[(\n\n3.0\n\n(d)\n\n2\n\n6\n\n1.5\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n8\n\n4\n\n(f)\n\n(e)\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n6\n\n3\n\n6\n\nln(d )\nI\n\nFig. 5.

The eigenvalues of other more complicated systems in this paper exhibit a Gaussian distribution\n[15], while that of d bosons is close to a triangular (I \u2265 n) or trapezoidal (I < n) distribution, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\n\u03c1[\u03c5(\u03c5+3)]\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nx 10\n\nx 10\n\n(c)\n\n5\n\n4\n4\n\n(d)\n\n10\n\n15\n4\n\nx 10\n\n0\n\n\u03c5(\u03c5+3)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n4\n\nx 10\n\n\f8\nFig. 6.

First, we demonstrate\n(min)\n= \u0112I \u2212 \u03a6(dI )\u03c3I with (\u03a6(dI ))2 = alnd + b works well for\nthat our semi-empirical formula suggested in Ref. [6], EI\nvarious examples (sd bosons, fermions in a single-j or many-j shells) with dimension ranging from 2 to 5000 (except\nfor d boson systems for which there are systematic deviations). We also improve our formula by adding the third-order\ncentral moment.\nSecond, we investigate eigen-energies of the excited states including the first, second, third and fourth lowest\nenergies. We find that the same formula with different parameters describes statistically very well to eigen energies.\nThird, we study d-boson systems and discuss why there are systematic deviation from our statistical formula of the\nlowest eigenvalues.\nIn this paper we also study the lowest energies of random matrices in Appendix. We see that there is systematic\ndeviation from Wigner's semi-circle prediction [16] when the dimension is not very large: when the dimension is less\nthan 100, the lowest eigenvalue can be evaluated statistically by the same formula of Ref. [6]. We suggest another\nstatistical formula of lowest eigenvalues of pure random matrices.\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for supporting\nthis work under grants 10575070, 10675081.

We change the dimension\nof matrices with dimension ranging from 2 to 3000. In Fig. 8(a), the dimension changes from 2 to 15. In this case, we\nsee a similar result as in main text. There exists linear correlation between \u03a62 and lnd (see Fig. 8(a) ), with a and b\nare very close to those in Sec. II. This means that Eq. (4) applies to general cases (statistically) when dimension of\nmatrix is not very large.\nWhen the dimension changes from 15 to 3000, we find that there is systematic deviation from linear correlation\nbetween \u03a62 and lnd. We empirically obtain\n\u2212 \u03a6(d) = a ln d/d + b : a = 1.59 \u00b1 0.03, b = \u22122.00 \u00b1 0.003.\n\n(10)\n\nas shown in Fig. 8(b). We see that Eq. (10) is more applicable than [\u03a6(d)]2 = a ln (d) + b when dimension of matrix\nbecomes large. We note that the parameter b in Eq. (10) saturates at 2 in the large d limit. This saturation value is\nthe predicted value of Wigner's semi-circle theorem.\n\n\f9\n\n-1.6\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nd\n\nd\n\n3\n\n2\n\n-1.8\n\n1\n-2.0\n1\n\n2\n\nIn(d)\n\n3\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nIn(d/d)\n\nFig. 7.

We obtain a = 0.97758 \u00b1 0.02426, b = 0.37201 \u00b1 0.04754 by \u03c72 fitting. These\nvalues are very close to those in Ref.[6]; (b) matrices with large dimension (d = 15 \u2212 3000). One can see a nice linear\ncorrelation between \u2212\u03a6(d) and ln d/d. We obtain that a = 1.589 \u00b1 0.028, b = \u22122.001 \u00b1 0.003 in Eq. (10).\n\n\f"}
