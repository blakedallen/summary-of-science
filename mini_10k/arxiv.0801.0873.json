Introduction\nLet N be a lattice of rank n and set NR = N \u2297Z R. Fix a d-dimensional lattice\npolytope P in N and, for each positive integer m, let fP (m) denote the number of\nlattice points in mP . It is a result of Ehrhart [5, 6] that fP (m) is a polynomial in\nm of degree d, called the Ehrhart polynomial of P . The generating series of fP (m)\ncan be written in the form\nX\nfP (m)tm = \u03b4P (t)/(1 \u2212 t)d+1 ,\nm\u22650\n\nwhere \u03b4P (t) is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to d, called the (Ehrhart)\n\u03b4-polynomial of P . If we write\n\u03b4P (t) = \u03b40 + \u03b41 t + * * * + \u03b4d td ,\nthen (\u03b40 , \u03b41 , . . . , \u03b4d ) is the (Ehrhart) \u03b4-vector of P . We will set \u03b4i = 0 for i < 0\nand i > d. It is a result of Stanley [18] that the coefficients \u03b4i are non-negative\nintegers. The degree s of \u03b4P (t) is called the degree of P and l = d + 1 \u2212 s is the\ncodegree of P . It is a consequence of Ehrhart Reciprocity that l is the smallest\npositive integer such that lP contains a lattice point in its relative interior (see,\nfor example, [11]). It is an open problem to characterise which vectors of nonnegative integers are \u03b4-vectors of a lattice polytope. Ideally, one would like a series\nof inequalities that are satisfied by exactly the \u03b4-vectors. We first summarise the\ncurrent state of knowledge concerning inequalities and Ehrhart \u03b4-vectors.\nIt follows from the definition that \u03b40 = 1 and \u03b41 = fP (1) \u2212 (d + 1) = |P \u2229 N | \u2212\n(d + 1). It is a consequence of Ehrhart Reciprocity that \u03b4d is the number of lattice\npoints in the relative interior of P (see, for example, [11]). Since P has at least d+ 1\nvertices, we have the inequality \u03b41 \u2265 \u03b4d . We list the known inequalities satisfied by\nthe Ehrhart \u03b4-vector (c.f. [3]).\n(1)\n\n\u03b41 \u2265 \u03b4d\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b40 + \u03b41 + * * * + \u03b4i+1 \u2265 \u03b4d + \u03b4d\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4d\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b40 + \u03b41 + * * * + \u03b4i \u2264 \u03b4s + \u03b4s\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4s\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , d,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. STAPLEDON\n\n(4)\n\nif \u03b4d 6= 0 then 1 \u2264 \u03b41 \u2264 \u03b4i for i = 2, . . . , d \u2212 1.\n\nInequalities (2) and (3) were proved by Hibi in [9] and Stanley in [20] respectively.\nBoth proofs are based on commutative algebra. Inequality (4) was proved by Hibi\nin [13] using combinatorial methods. Recently, Henk and Tagami [8] produced\nexamples showing that the analogue of (4) when \u03b4d = 0 is false. That is, it is not\ntrue that \u03b41 \u2264 \u03b4i for i = 2, . . . , s \u2212 1. An explicit example is provided in Example\n2.4 below.\nWe improve upon these inequalities by proving the following result (Theorem\n2.19). We remark that the proof is purely combinatorial.\nTheorem. Let P be a d-dimensional lattice polytope of degree s and codegree l.\nThe Ehrhart \u03b4-vector (\u03b40 , . . . , \u03b4d ) of P satisfies the following inequalities.\n(5)\n\n\u03b41 \u2265 \u03b4d ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b42 + * * * + \u03b4i+1 \u2265 \u03b4d\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4d\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b40 + \u03b41 + * * * + \u03b4i \u2264 \u03b4s + \u03b4s\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4s\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , d,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b42\u2212l + * * * + \u03b40 + \u03b41 \u2264 \u03b4i + \u03b4i\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4i\u2212l+1 for i = 2, . . . , d \u2212 1.\n\nRemark 1.1. Equality can be achieved in all the inequalities in the above theorem.\nFor example, let N be a lattice with basis e1 , . . . , ed and let P be the regular simplex\nwith vertices 0, e1 , . . . , ed . In this case, \u03b4P (t) = 1 and each inequality above is an\nequality.\nRemark 1.2. Observe that (5) and (6) imply that\n(9)\n\n\u03b41 + * * * + \u03b4i + \u03b4i+1 \u2265 \u03b4d + \u03b4d\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4d\u2212i ,\n\nfor i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1. Since \u03b40 = 1, we conclude that (2) is always a strict\ninequality. We note that inequality (6) was suggested by Hibi in [13].\nRemark 1.3. We can view the above result as providing, in particular, a combinatorial proof of Stanley's inequality (7).\nRemark 1.4. We claim that inequality (8) provides the correct generalisation of\nHibi's inequality (4). Our contribution is to prove the cases when l > 1 and we\nrefer the reader to [13] for a proof of (4). In fact, in the proof of the above theorem\nwe show that (8) can be deduced from (4), (6) and (7).\nIn order to prove this result, we consider the polynomial\n\u03b4\u0304P (t) = (1 + t + * * * + tl\u22121 )\u03b4P (t)\nand use a result of Payne (Theorem 2 [16]) to establish the following decomposition\ntheorem (Theorem 2.14). This generalises a result of Betke and McMullen for lattice\npolytopes containing a lattice point in their relative interior (Theorem 5 [4]).\nTheorem. The polynomial \u03b4\u0304P (t) has a unique decomposition\n\u03b4\u0304P (t) = a(t) + tl b(t),\nwhere a(t) and b(t) are polynomials with integer coefficients satisfying a(t) = td a(t\u22121 )\nand b(t) = td\u2212l b(t\u22121 ). Moreover, the coefficients of b(t) are non-negative and, if ai\ndenotes the coefficient of ti in a(t), then\n1 = a0 \u2264 a1 \u2264 ai ,\n\n\fINEQUALITIES AND EHRHART \u03b4-VECTORS\n\n3\n\nfor i = 2, . . . , d \u2212 1.\nUsing some elementary arguments we show that our desired inequalities are\nequivalent to certain conditions on the coefficients of \u03b4\u0304P (t), a(t) and b(t) (Lemma\n2.5) and hence are a consequence of the above theorem.\nWe also consider the following result of Stanley (Theorem 4.4 [17]), which was\nproved using commutative algebra.\nTheorem. If P is a lattice polytope of degree s and codegree l, then \u03b4P (t) =\nts \u03b4P (t\u22121 ) if and only if lP is a translate of a reflexive polytope.\nWe show that this result is a consequence of the above decomposition of \u03b4\u0304P (t),\nthus providing a combinatorial proof of Stanley's theorem (Corollary 2.18). A\ndifferent combinatorial proof in the case l = 1 is provided in [12].\nRecent work of Athanasiadis [1, 2] relates the existence of certain triangulations\nof a lattice polytope P to inequalities satisfied by its \u03b4-vector.\nTheorem (Theorem 1.3 [1]).

We remark that the method of proof is different to that of\nAthanasiadis.\nI would like to thank my advisor Mircea Musta\u0163\u01ce for all his help. I would also\nlike to thank Sam Payne for some valuable feedback. The author was supported by\nMircea Musta\u0163\u01ce's Packard Fellowship and by an Eleanor Sophia Wood travelling\nscholarship from the University of Sydney.\n2. Inequalities and Ehrhart \u03b4-Vectors\nWe will use the definitions and notation from the introduction throughout the\npaper. Our main object of study will be the polynomial\n\u03b4\u0304P (t) = (1 + t + * * * + tl\u22121 )\u03b4P (t).\nSince \u03b4P (t) has degree s and non-negative integer coefficients, it follows that \u03b4\u0304P (t)\nhas degree d and non-negative integer coefficients. In fact, we will show that \u03b4\u0304P (t)\n\n\f4\n\nA. STAPLEDON\n\nhas positive integer coefficients (Theorem 2.14). Observe that we can recover \u03b4P (t)\nfrom \u03b4\u0304P (t) if we know the codegree l of P . If we write\n\u03b4\u0304P (t) = \u03b4\u03040 + \u03b4\u03041 t + * * * + \u03b4\u0304d td ,\nthen\n\u03b4\u0304i = \u03b4i + \u03b4i\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4i\u2212l+1 ,\n\n(15)\n\nfor i = 0, . . . , d. Note that \u03b4\u03040 = 1 and \u03b4\u0304d = \u03b4s .\nExample 2.1. Let N be a lattice with basis e1 , . . . , ed and let P be the standard\nsimplex with vertices 0, e1 , . . . , ed . It can be shown that \u03b4P (t) = 1 and hence\n\u03b4\u0304P (t) = 1 + t + * * * + td . On the other hand, if Q is the standard reflexive simplex\nwith vertices e1 , . . . , ed and \u2212e1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 ed , then \u03b4\u0304Q (t) = \u03b4Q (t) = 1 + t + * * * + td .\nWe conclude that \u03b4\u0304P (t) does not determine \u03b4P (t).\nRemark 2.2. We can interpret \u03b4\u0304P (t) as the Ehrhart \u03b4-vector of a (d+l)-dimensional\npolytope. More specifically, let Q be the standard reflexive simplex of dimension\nl \u2212 1 in a lattice M as above. Henk and Tagami [8] defined P \u2297 Q to be the\nconvex hull in (N \u00d7 M \u00d7 Z)R of P \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 {0} and {0} \u00d7 Q \u00d7 {1}. By Lemma\n1.3 in [8], P \u2297 Q is a (d + l)-dimensional lattice polytope with Ehrhart \u03b4-vector\n\u03b4P \u2297Q (t) = \u03b4P (t)\u03b4Q (t) = \u03b4P (t)(1 + t + * * * + tl\u22121 ) = \u03b4\u0304P (t)\nOur main objects of study will be the polynomials a(t) and b(t) in the following\nelementary lemma.\nLemma 2.3. The polynomial \u03b4\u0304P (t) has a unique decomposition\n\u03b4\u0304P (t) = a(t) + tl b(t),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere a(t) and b(t) are polynomials with integer coefficients satisfying a(t) = td a(t\u22121 )\nand b(t) = td\u2212l b(t\u22121 ).\nProof.

Let N be a lattice with basis e1 , . . . , e5 and let P be the 5-dimensional\nlattice polytope with vertices 0, e1 , e1 + e2 , e2 + 2e3 , 3e4 + e5 and e5 . Henk and\nTagami showed that \u03b4P (t) = (1 + t2 )(1 + 2t) = 1 + 2t + t2 + 2t3 (Example 1.1 in [8]).\n\n\fINEQUALITIES AND EHRHART \u03b4-VECTORS\n\n5\n\nIt follows that s = l = 3 and \u03b4\u0304P (t) = 1 + 3t + 4t2 + 5t3 + 3t4 + 2t5 .

The result follows by substituting (15),(17) and (18) into the right hand\nsides of the above statements.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.6. The coefficients of a(t) are unimodal if a0 = 1 \u2264 a1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 a\u230ad/2\u230b .\nIt follows from (17) that ai+1 \u2212 ai = \u03b4i+1 \u2212 \u03b4d\u2212i for all i. Hence the coefficients of\na(t) are unimodal if and only if \u03b4i+1 \u2265 \u03b4d\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1. In Remark\n2.17, we show that the coefficients of a(t) are unimodal for d \u2264 5.\nRemark 2.7. A lattice polytope P is reflexive if the origin is the unique lattice point\nin its relative interior and each facet F of P has the form F = {v \u2208 P | hu, vi = \u22121},\nfor some u \u2208 Hom(N, Z). Equivalently, P is reflexive if it contains the origin in\nits relative interior and, for every positive integer m, every non-zero lattice point\nin mP lies on \u2202(nP ) for a unique positive integer n \u2264 m. It is a result of Hibi\n[12] that \u03b4P (t) = td \u03b4P (t\u22121 ) if and only if P is a translate of a reflexive polytope\n(c.f. Corollary 2.18). We see from Lemma 2.3 that \u03b4P (t) = td \u03b4P (t\u22121 ) if and only\nif \u03b4P (t) = \u03b4\u0304P (t) = a(t). Payne and Musta\u0163\u01ce gave examples of reflexive polytopes\nwhere the coefficients of \u03b4P (t) = a(t) are not unimodal [15]. Further examples are\ngiven by Payne for all d \u2265 6 [16].\nRemark 2.8. It follows from (18) that bi+1 \u2212 bi = \u03b4s\u2212(i+1) \u2212 \u03b4i+1 for all i. Hence the\ncoefficients of b(t) are unimodal if and only if \u03b4i \u2264 \u03b4s\u2212i for i = 1, . . . , \u230a(s \u2212 1)/2\u230b.\nWe see from Example 2.4 that the coefficients of b(t) are not necessarily unimodal.\nOur next goal is to express \u03b4\u0304P (t) as a sum of shifted h-vectors, using a result of\nPayne (Theorem 1.2 [16]). We first fix a lattice triangulation T of \u2202P and recall\nwhat it means for T to be regular. Translate P by an element of NQ so that the\norigin lies in its interior and let \u03a3 denote the fan over the faces of T . Then T\nis regular if \u03a3 can be realised as the fan over the faces of a rational polytope.\nEquivalently, T is regular if the toric variety X(\u03a3) is projective. We may always\nchoose T to be a regular triangulation (see, for example, [1]). We regard the empty\nface as a face of T of dimension \u22121. For each face F of T , consider the h-vector of\nF,\nX\nhF (t) =\ntdim G\u2212dim F (1 \u2212 t)d\u22121\u2212dim G .\nF \u2286G\n\nWe recall the following well-known lemma and outline a geometric proof. We refer\nthe reader to [7] for more details (see also [19]).\n\n\f6\n\nA. STAPLEDON\n\nLemma 2.9. Let T be a regular lattice triangulation of \u2202P . If F is a face of T ,\nthen the h-vector of F is a polynomial of degree d \u2212 1 \u2212 dim F with symmetric,\nunimodal integer coefficients. That is, if hi denotes the coefficient of ti in hF (t),\nthen hi = hd\u22121\u2212dim F \u2212i for all i and 1 = h0 \u2264 h1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 h\u230a(d\u22121\u2212dim F )/2\u230b .

As above, translate P by an element of NQ so that the origin lies in its\ninterior and let \u03a3 denote the fan over the faces of T . For each face F of \u03c4 , let\nspan F denote the smallest linear subspace of NR containing F and let \u03a3F be\nthe complete fan in NR / span F whose cones are the projections of the cones in \u03a3\ncontaining F . We can interpret hi as the dimension of the 2ith cohomology group of\nthe projective toric variety X(\u03a3F ). The symmetry of the hi follows from Poincar\u00e9\nDuality on X(\u03a3F ), while unimodality follows from the Hard Lefschetz Theorem.\nThe cohomology ring H \u2217 (X(\u03a3F ), Q) is isomorphic to the quotient of a polynomial\nring in h1 variables of degree 2 and hence hi is bounded by the number of monomials\nof degree i in h1 variables of degree 1.\n\u0003\nRecall that l is the smallest positive integer such that lP contains a lattice point\nin its relative interior and fix a lattice point v\u0304 in lP r \u2202(lP ). Let N \u2032 = N \u00d7 Z and\nlet u : N \u2032 \u2192 Z denote the projection onto the second factor. We write \u03c3 for the\ncone over P \u00d7 {1} in NR\u2032 and \u03c1 for the ray through (v\u0304, l). For each face F of T , let\n\u03c3F denote the cone over F and let \u03c3F\u2032 denote the cone generated by \u03c3F and \u03c1. The\nempty face corresponds to the origin and \u03c1 respectively. The union of such cones\nforms a simplicial fan \u25b3 refining \u03c3. For each non-zero cone \u03c4 in \u25b3, with primitive\ninteger generators v1 , . . . , vr , we consider the open parallelopiped\nBox(\u03c4 ) = {a1 v1 + * * * + ar vr | 0 < ai < 1},\nand observe that we have an involution\n\u03b9 : Box(\u03c4 ) \u2229 N \u2032 \u2192 Box(\u03c4 ) \u2229 N \u2032\n\u03b9(a1 v1 + * * * + ar vr ) = (1 \u2212 a1 )v1 + * * * + (1 \u2212 ar )vr .\nWe also set Box({0}) = {0} and \u03b9(0) = 0. Observe that Box(\u03c1) \u2229 N \u2032 = \u2205.

For example, when F is the empty face, BF (t) = 1 and BF\u2032 (t) = 0.\nWe will need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.10. For each face F of T , BF (t) = tdim F +1 BF (t\u22121 ) and BF\u2032 (t) =\ntdim F +l+1 BF\u2032 (t\u22121 ).\n\n\fINEQUALITIES AND EHRHART \u03b4-VECTORS\n\nProof.

Let T be a regular lattice triangulation of \u2202P . We may assume that T\ncontains every lattice point of \u2202P as a vertex (see, for example, [1]).

Recall,\nfrom Remark 2.7, that a lattice polytope P is reflexive if and only if it contains\nthe origin in its relative interior and, for every positive integer m, every non-zero\nlattice point in mP lies on \u2202(nP ) for a unique positive integer n \u2264 m.\nCorollary 2.18. If P is a lattice polytope of degree s and codegree l, then \u03b4P (t) =\nts \u03b4P (t\u22121 ) if and only if lP is a translate of a reflexive polytope.\nProof. Since td \u03b4\u0304P (t\u22121 ) = ts \u03b4P (t\u22121 )(1 + t+ * * *+ tl\u22121 ), we see that \u03b4P (t) = ts \u03b4P (t\u22121 )\nif and only if td \u03b4\u0304P (t\u22121 ) = \u03b4\u0304P (t). By Lemma 2.3, we need to show that b(t) = 0 if\nand only if lP is a translate of a reflexive polytope. By Remark 2.11, b(t) = 0 if\nand only if every element v in \u03c3 \u2229 (N \u00d7 lZ) can be written as the sum of an element\nof \u2202(mlP ) \u00d7 {ml} and m\u2032 (v\u0304, l), for some non-negative integers m and m\u2032 . That is,\nb(t) = 0 if and only if lP \u2212 v\u0304 is a reflexive polytope.\n\u0003\nWe now prove our second main result.\nTheorem 2.19. Let P be a d-dimensional lattice polytope of degree s and codegree\nl. The Ehrhart \u03b4-vector (\u03b40 , . . . , \u03b4d ) of P satisfies the following inequalities.\n\u03b41 \u2265 \u03b4d ,\n\u03b42 + * * * + \u03b4i+1 \u2265 \u03b4d\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4d\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1,\n\u03b40 + \u03b41 + * * * + \u03b4i \u2264 \u03b4s + \u03b4s\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4s\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , d,\n\u03b42\u2212l + * * * + \u03b40 + \u03b41 \u2264 \u03b4i + \u03b4i\u22121 + * * * + \u03b4i\u2212l+1 for i = 2, . . . , d \u2212 1.\nProof. We observed in the introduction that \u03b41 \u2265 \u03b4d . By Lemma 2.5, the second\ninequality is equivalent to a1 \u2264 ai , for i = 2, . . . , d \u2212 1, and the third inequality is\nequivalent to bi \u2265 0 for all i. Hence these inequalities follow from Theorem 2.14.\nWhen l \u2265 2, the conditions above imply that \u03b4\u03041 \u2264 \u03b4\u0304i for i = 2, . . . , d\u22121. By Lemma\n2.5, this proves the final inequality when l > 1. When l = 1, the last inequality is\nHibi's result (4).\n\u0003\nA lattice triangulation T of \u2202P is unimodular if for every non-empty face F of\nT , the cone over F \u00d7 {1} in NR\u2032 is non-singular. Equivalenty, T is unimodular if\nand only if Box(\u03c3F ) = \u2205, for every non-empty face F of T .\n\n\f10\n\nA. STAPLEDON\n\nTheorem 2.20. Let P be a d-dimensional lattice polytope. If \u2202P admits a regular\nunimodular lattice triangulation, then\n\u03b4i+1 \u2265 \u03b4d\u2212i\n\u03b40 + * * * + \u03b4i+1\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b4d + i + 1\n\u2264 \u03b4d + * * * + \u03b4d\u2212i +\n,\ni+1\n\nfor i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1.\nProof. From the above discussion, if \u2202P admits a regular unimodular triangulation\nthen BF (t) = 0 for every non-empty face F of T . By (22), a(t) = hF (t), where\nF is the empty face of T . By Lemma 2.3, 1 = a0 \u2264 a1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 a\u230ad/2\u230b and\n\u0001\nai \u2264 a1 +i\u22121\nfor i = 1, . . . , d. The result now follows from the expression ai+1 =\ni\n\u03b40 + * * * + \u03b4i+1 \u2212 \u03b4d \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03b4d\u2212i (see (17)).\n\u0003\nRemark 2.21. When P is the regular simplex of dimension d, \u03b4P (t) = 1 and both\ninequalities in Theorem 2.20 are equalities.\nRemark 2.22. Recall that if P is a reflexive polytope then the coefficients of the\nEhrhart \u03b4-vector are symmetric (Remark 2.7). In this case, Theorem 2.20 implies\nthat if \u2202P admits a regular, unimodular lattice triangulation then the coefficients\nof the \u03b4-vector are symmetric and unimodal. Note that if P is reflexive then P\nadmits a regular unimodular lattice triangulation if and only if \u2202P admits a regular\nunimodular lattice triangulation. Hence this result is a consequence of the theorem\nof Athanasiadis stated in the introduction (Theorem 1.3 [1]). This special case was\nfirst proved by Hibi in [10].\nRemark 2.23. Recall that \u03b41 = |P \u2229 N | \u2212 (d + 1) and \u03b4d = |(P r \u2202P ) \u2229 N |.\nHence \u03b41 = \u03b4d if and only if |\u2202P \u2229 N | = d + 1. If |\u2202P \u2229 N | = d + 1 and \u2202P\nadmits a regular, unimodular lattice triangulation then, by Theorems 2.19 and\n2.20, \u03b40 + * * * + \u03b4i+1 = \u03b4d + * * * + \u03b4d\u2212i + 1, for i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1. This implies\nthat \u03b4i+1 = \u03b4d\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , \u230ad/2\u230b \u2212 1. If, in addition, P is reflexive then the\ncoefficients of the \u03b4-vector are symmetric and hence \u03b4P (t) = 1 + t + * * * + td .\nRemark 2.24. Let P be a lattice polytope of dimension d in N and let Q be the\nconvex hull of P \u00d7 {1} and the origin in (N \u00d7 Z)R . That is, Q is the pyramid over\nP . If \u2202Q admits a regular unimodular lattice triangulation T then T restricts to\ngive regular unimodular lattice triangulations of P and \u2202P .\nRemark 2.25. Hibi gave an example of a 4-dimensional reflexive lattice polytope\nwhose boundary does not admit a regular unimodular lattice triangulation (Example 36.4 [11]). By Remark 2.24, there are examples of d-dimensional lattice\npolytopes P such that \u2202P does not admit a regular unimodular lattice triangulation for d \u2265 4. On the other hand, if P is a lattice polytope of dimension d \u2264 3,\nthen \u2202P always admits a regular, unimodular lattice triangulation. In fact, any\nregular triangulation of \u2202P containing every lattice point as a vertex is necessarily\nunimodular. This follows from the fact that if Q is a lattice polytope of dimension\nd\u2032 \u2264 2 and |Q \u2229 N | = d\u2032 + 1, then Q is isomorphic to the regular d\u2032 -simplex.\nReferences\n1.
