The problem of gravity\nI have purposefully chosen a controversial title for this contribution. But, the bar is\nhigh \u2013 the challenges of quantum gravity are profound. While string theory has certainly\nprovided new ideas about how to address some of these problems, it seems clear that it\nstill has a fair ways to go if it is to resolve them all.\nNonrenormalizability has long been regarded as a central problem of quantum gravity,\nand here string theory yielded promising success. Specifically, string theory naturally\nregulates the infinite proliferation of ultraviolet divergences in the loop expansion, and,\norder-by-order in perturbation theory, apparently gives UV finite scattering amplitudes.\nAnother central issue for gravity research has been that of spacetime singularities.\nHere, string theory has also had interesting success, providing new mechanisms and suggestions about how stringy effects can replace singularities by regular configurations, particularly in the case of timelike singularities. (Spacelike singularities have remained more\nproblematic.)\nThese successes overcame problems that had been the focus of years of struggle. But,\nwith time, it has also become clear that these \"short-distance\" problems are not the only\nproblems of quantum gravity. With evolution of our knowledge, it now seems that there\nare other problems both more \"long-distance,\" and more profound.\nOne such deeper problem is that of unitarity of the S-matrix for gravitational scattering. Other historical examples of incomplete theories \u2013 for example the four-Fermi theory\nof weak interactions \u2013 could be viewed as presenting a problem of nonrenormalizability\nor of unitarity, with these being linked, as one finds when studying scattering at energies\nnear the electroweak scale. Attempts to describe gravitational scattering also encounter\na unitarity problem, but one that appears to be associated with long-distance physics,\nand does not have an obvious cure in any short-distance modification of the theory. One\nguise of this problem is the \"black hole information problem\" (or \"paradox\"), which arose\nfrom Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation[1] and arguments that it implies fundamental nonunitarity[2]. It is apparently a long-distance problem because, for example,\nultraplanckian scattering classically produces large black holes, and one finds a conflict\nbetween basic principles seemingly independent of the assumptions made about short distance physics. Either in this context, or in the context of collapse of a massive object,\nunitarity appears at odds with locality at macroscopic scales \u2013 as large as the black hole\nin question.\n1\n\n\fString theorists have suggested a picture for restoration of unitarity \u2013 through dualities, and the idea of \"holography,\" but a critical question is whether the proposed picture\ndoes in fact furnish a complete description of such gravitational scattering, and how it does\nso.\nIn trying to answer this question, one begins to make contact with another profound\nproblem of quantum gravity: how does a theory of quantum gravity describe observations\n(or observables) that are local, at least in some approximation? In fact, a description of\nsuch quantities seems critical for fully addressing the information problem, since the basic\n\"paradox\" results from calculations involving local quantities both inside and outside the\nblack hole. Moreover, a complete physical picture should be able to describe the observations of an observer who falls into a black hole. However, existing string constructions so\nfar provide us with (at best) the S-matrix, and do not yet address the general question of\nproviding approximately local observables.\nMore broadly, the problem of local observables in gravity appears a deep one, and one\nthat touches on other difficulties resulting from string theory. First, while in field theory\nlocal fields provide us with local observables, the diffeomorphism symmetry apparent in a\nlow-energy description of gravity indicates that local observables aren't gauge invariant.\nA proposed resolution of this \u2013 whose semiclassical form is used in current studies of\ninflationary cosmology \u2013 is that local observables are approximately recovered relationally,\nspecifically in relation to localized features of the state. But, such a picture encounters\nchallenges in a full quantum treatment, since the corresponding \"reference background\"\ncan fluctuate. This indicates, at the least, that familiar locality is not a precise concept.\nMore than that, in a complete relational description one might include a description\nof observers as part of the quantum system, but in the context of inflationary cosmology\nquantum fluctuations can apparently produce new observers. This problem has become\nparticularly manifest in attempts to make sense of eternal inflation in the \"string landscape,\" where attempts to regulate corresponding infinities and provide a \"measure\" have\nseemingly lead to nonsensical results, such as an end to time[3]. It should be stressed that\nthese problems are also long-distance, or infrared, issues. We might also note that these\nproblems are particularly forced upon us by the apparently huge number of possible vacua\nof string theory, which then requires an environmental/anthropic approach to prediction,\nand hence discussion of such measures. (One may also consider the possibility that the\nvacuum problem is another warning that string theory is missing something important.)\n2\n\n\fString theory has undoubtedly had many successes, from important implications in\nmathematics, to giving powerful methods to generate approximate effective descriptions\nof complex systems such as the quark-gluon plasma or condensed-matter systems[4]. It\nmoreover offers us hints about how to generate the chiral gauge structure of the Standard\nModel of particle physics. It is clearly a powerful mathematical framework.\nBut, if it is to be a fundamental theory of nature, string theory also needs to provide\na means to answer the most profound questions of quantum gravity, and these are very\nchallenging. This contribution will give a more in-depth discussion of some of these challenges, and discuss string theory's response to these. I will also comment on some possible\ngeneral features of a theory of quantum gravity, whether this arises from string theory, or\nfrom another approach.\n\n2. The gravitational S-matrix and the ultraplanckian regime\n2.1. The S-matrix\nIn physics one seeks sharply predictable quantities, and a first question is what these\nmight be in a quantum theory of gravity. We will return to the question of local observables, but the most straightforward candidates for sharp prediction are elements of the\nS-matrix.1 This is strongly motivated by empirical observation. First, the curvature radius of the Universe is of order 1060 in Planck units, so Minkowski space is an extremely\ngood approximate solution to the underlying theory. Secondly, we observe that the excitations about Minkowski space involve asymptotic states that are well-described as particles\n\u2013 electrons, photons, etc. So, whatever one has as an underlying fundamental description\nof these particle states, one expects to be able to give amplitudes for scattering of \"in\"\nstates consisting of widely-separated particles to similar \"out\" states.\nEven here, there are some subtleties, due to the masslessness of the graviton. Specifically, in spacetime dimension D = 4 there are divergences associated with emission of\narbitrarily soft gravitons. While these are infrared divergences, there is a case that they\ndon't drive at more profound issues, but are rather of a more technical nature. In particular, very similar divergences arise in quantum electrodynamics, and are cured there\nby summing over soft photons, to give inclusive probabilities that take into account inpractice limitations on any experiment's IR resolving power. Gravity seems to behave\n1\n\nFor further discussion, see [5].\n\n3\n\n\fsimilarly[6,7]. Moreover, there are indications that gravity might be formulated in higher\ndimensions, and there soft-graviton divergences are absent.\nIndeed, string theory directly yields approximate calculations of the S-matrix, in\nhigher-dimensional spacetime, that appear to avoid some pitfalls of earlier approaches\nto the problem of gravitational scattering.\nA particularly important testing ground for any candidate gravity theory's predictions\nof the S-matrix is the ultraplanckian regime, where one scatters particles far above the Ddimensional Planck mass MD .2 That such a limit should exist follows from very general\nprinciples: Lorentz invariance of Minkowski space, and a very mild form of locality. A\ngiven particle may be boosted to arbitrarily high energies by a Lorentz transform, and\none may moreover consider independent boosts of widely-separated particles, to arrange\nparticles with an ultraplanckian center of mass (CM) energy, which then collide.3\nTo understand how string theory meets the challenges of this regime, we first need to\nreview some basic features of gravitational scattering. Some early discussions of scattering\nand string theory in this regime include [8,9,10,11].\n2.2. Perturbative scattering\nIn the subplanckian regime, Einstein's theory, viewed as an effective field theory,\napparently makes perfectly good predictions. While nonrenormalizability tells us that\ninfinitely many higher-dimension operators are induced through quantization, these naturally have coefficients that are inverse powers of MD , and so make negligible contributions\nto low-energy gravitational scattering. Specifically, it appears that in this regime, the\nBorn approximation, namely single graviton exchange, gives a very good approximation to\nthe gravitational S-matrix. For scattering of particles with incoming (outgoing) momenta\np1 , p2 (\u2212p3 , \u2212p4 ), and using the Mandelstam parameters\ns = \u2212(p1 + p2 )2 , t = \u2212(p1 + p3 )2 , u = \u2212(p1 + p4 )2 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nthe scattering amplitude in the limit s \u226b \u2212t is\nT0 = \u22128\u03c0GD s2 /t .\n\n(2.2)\n\n2\n\nD\u22122\nWe adopt the convention MD\n= (2\u03c0)D\u22124 /(8\u03c0GD ).\n\n3\n\nEven theories without Lorentz invariance, e.g. with modified dispersion relations, appear to\n\nneed to address such a regime, or confront even greater complications. One example would be in\nblack hole formation from non-relativistic particles.\n\n4\n\n\fConversely, when scattering energies reach the Planck energy, one expects the higher\ndimension operators to make important and unpredictable contributions; at the same time\none expects a breakdown of unitarity, due to growth of amplitudes. String theory suggests\na way to tame these amplitudes, by regulating higher-loop divergences, and effectively\nfixing the coefficients of the higher-dimension operators.\nHowever, it is important to think about this in a more refined view, where one more\ncarefully specifies scattering parameters. For example, one might consider scattering as a\nfunction of both energy E, and impact parameter b. Even for ultraplanckian scattering\nenergies, at sufficiently large impact parameter gravity is very weak, and the Born approximation appears good. Ultimately, though, for a fixed ultraplanckian energy, at small\nenough impact parameter the Born approximation does break down.\n\nFig. 1: A proposed \"phase diagram\" of different regimes for gravitational\nscattering. In particular, we consider the effect of decreasing impact parameter, at fixed ultraplanckian energy, as indicated by the arrow. NR indicates\nthe regime where higher-dimension operators are expected to be important.\n\n5\n\n\fIn fact, this happens in the regime of familiar gravity experiments. Higher-loop corrections become important, but these are very specific higher-loop corrections. They correspond to iterated single-graviton exchange, which constructs the ladder (and crossedladder) diagrams. The region where these are important is indicated in Fig. 1. When the\nmomentum transfer is small, q \u226a E, these diagrams can be approximated and summed to\ngive the eikonal amplitudes[9,10,12,13,14],\nZ\niTeik (s, t) = 2s dD\u22122 x\u22a5 e\u2212iq\u22a5 *x\u22a5 (ei\u03c7(E,x\u22a5 ) \u2212 1) ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the eikonal phase \u03c7(E, x\u22a5) is a Fourier transform of the tree-level amplitude,\nZ D\u22122\n1\nd\nq\u22a5 \u2212iq\u22a5 *x\u22a5\n2\n\u03c7(E, x\u22a5) =\ne\nTtree (s, \u2212q\u22a5\n)\n(2.4)\nD\u22122\n2s\n(2\u03c0)\nwith respect to the transverse components of the momentum transfer, q\u22a5 . Using the Born\n(single-graviton) amplitude (2.2), one easily finds\n\u03c7=\n\n4\u03c0\nGD s\nD\u22124\n(D \u2212 4)\u03a9D\u22123 x\u22a5\n\n(2.5)\n\nwith \u03a9n the volume of the unit n-sphere. (The exponent D \u2212 4 instead gives logarithms\n\nin D = 4.) The classical approximation arises from a saddlepoint approximation to (2.3),\n\nand x\u22a5 is naturally identified with impact parameter. This most experimentally accessible\nregime governs everything from apples to galaxy clusters \u2013 from nonrelativistic processes\nwith ultraplanckian CM energies to, apparently, the case of ultrarelativistic, small angle\nscattering.\nIt seems intuitively clear that string effects should not be relevant in the classical regime, and one can understand the broader reason for this with some simple\nestimates[15,16]. First, one could have inserted the string tree-level amplitude into (2.3),\nthrough (2.4). In the high-energy limit this amplitude takes the form\nT0string (s, t) \u221d gs2\n\n\u0393(\u2212t/8) 2+t/4 2\u2212t/4\ns\ne\n,\n\u0393(1 + t/8)\n\n(2.6)\n\nin units \u03b1\u2032 = 1/2. However, as was explained, the eikonal amplitude is dominated by the\nsaddlepoint given by\nD\u22123\nq \u223c GD E 2 /x\u22a5\n.\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 1/(D\u22124)\nb<\n,\n\u223c (GE )\n\n(2.8)\n\nFor impact parameters\n\n6\n\n\fthe eikonal phase is large at the saddlepoint, \u03c7 >\n\u223c 1, indicating that higher terms in the\nexponential series of (2.3) are important. In particular, we know that the terms with order\nN \u223c \u03c7 give the dominant contribution to the exponential. Such a term corresponds to a\n\nladder with N + 1 rungs, and the total momentum transfer is typically expected to divide\namong these, with a value\nk\u223c\n\n1\nq\n\u223c\nN +1\nb\n\n(2.9)\n\nper rung. Specifically, in evaluating the eikonal phase (2.4) with the string tree amplitude (2.6), the typical momentum transfer is of size (2.9), and so one expects the string\ncorrections to be negligibly small for large impact parameters.\nIn fact, this discussion extends to consideration of arbitrary short-distance effects.\nIn the large-impact parameter regime under discussion, they appear to make negligible\ncontribution. To summarize the picture, as we decrease the impact parameter at a fixed\nultraplanckian energy, initially the Born approximation is good, but then breaks down\nwhere \u03c7 grows to O(1), at b given by (2.8). The eikonal approximation then unitarizes\nthe amplitudes[17]. But, in the corresponding diagrams dominating the amplitudes, the\n\nmomentum transfer q, even if large, is fractionated into small momentum transfers k with\nsize (2.9). Thus, the scattering is dominated by \"soft\" physics, and \"hard\" effects are not\nexpected to make important contributions.\nIn particular, one might have been concerned that divergences and nonrenormalizability are relevant to such a discussion of loop diagrams. Indeed, in making the eikonal\napproximation (2.3), one makes the UV behavior of individual loop amplitudes even worse,\nas is seen in expanding the exponential in (2.3) and using (2.5) \u2013 the individual terms have\nincreasingly bad UV divergences. However, it seems clear that this is not a good way to\nevaluate (2.3). This is best illustrated by a simple example[18], like the integral\nI=\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n2\n\ndbb3 eig/b ,\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u039b\u22121\n\nwhere g is a small constant and \u039b is a UV cutoff. This has a similar short-distance\nstructure to the D = 6 eikonal amplitude. Expanding the exponential in powers of g yields\narbitrarily high-order powers of \u039b. Yet, this integral can be explicitly evaluated, and has\na finite limit as \u039b \u2192 \u221e \u2013 illustrating the insensitivity to UV effects. Expanding and\n\nintegrating term-by-term is a bad way to evaluate (2.10) or (2.3).\n\nThese statements can also be tested in supergravity, which provides an explicit regulator making loop amplitudes finite (perhaps to all orders[19]), and yields explicit expressions\n7\n\n\ffor low-loop amplitudes. In fact, the resulting expressions nicely match[18] terms in the\neikonal amplitude (2.3) at one and two loops, up to corrections suppressed by powers of\n\u2212t/s, and the cutoff dependence. Note that this is true despite the extra states \u2013 gravitino,\netc. \u2013 present in supergravity. This illustrates a general feature of such long-distance, ultraplanckian scattering, that of graviton dominance[8,18]. Specifically, since particles couple\nto powers of the energy given by their spins, the graviton, as the highest-spin state of the\nsupergravity multiplet, dominates the scattering at high energies.\nMomentum fractionation is a mechanism to decouple high-energy scattering from\nshort-distance properties of the theory. For example, even very large momentum transfers\nonly appear to probe the gravitational coupling constant at scales given by (2.9). This\nmechanism seems to be a central feature in \"UV-IR\" mixing.\n\nFig. 2: The two-loop \"H-diagram\"; straight lines are associated with the\nscattered high-energy particles.\n\nAn important question is when the approximations giving the eikonal amplitude (2.3)\nfail. One expects both corrections due to radiation, and from higher loops and terms\ndropped in making the eikonal approximation. Aspects of the corrections due to radiation\nare understood, from classical analyses[20] and study of soft gravitons[6,7,17], and we will\nfocus on the latter corrections. We have already indicated that they can appear, suppressed\nby powers of \u2212t/s. These then become important at scattering angle \u03b8 \u223c 1, or, from (2.7),\n\nimpact parameter\n\nb = R(E) \u223c (GD E)1/(D\u22123) ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nindicated in Fig. 1. For example, simple power-counting arguments (see, e.g., [21]) applied\nto the loop diagram of Fig. 2 shows that it is suppressed by [R(E)/b]2(D\u22123) relative to the\nBorn amplitude (2.2); this also was seen explicitly in the supergravity analysis[18]. The\npresence of such corrections suggest the breakdown of the perturbative expansion at the\nimpact parameter (2.11).4 This is our first indication that we lack a means to compute\nthe gravitational S-matrix in this region.\n4\n\nMore precisely, we might think about the perturbative expansion around the classical geometry corresponding to the saddlepoint in the eikonal amplitude. This will be described below.\n\n8\n\n\f2.3. The strong gravity regime and the unitarity crisis\nThe nature of the perturbative breakdown may be readily understood through comparing a simpler calculation. We are describing the gravitational field sourced by two\nparticles with high CM energy, but one can similarly examine diagrams sourced by a single massive particle at rest. In this case, Duff[22] showed that the sum over tree diagrams\ngives the expansion of the Schwarzschild metric about flat space in powers of GD . This\nexpansion manifestly diverges at radii r \u2264 R(M ), where R(M ) is the Schwarzschild radius,\n\nwith parametric dependence as in (2.11). A black hole is not a small perturbation about\nflat space.\nAs a check of this interpretation, note that we have already indicated the connection\nof the eikonal amplitudes with the classical approximation. The classical metric of a highenergy source is well-approximated by the Aichelburg-Sexl (AS) metric[23],\nds2 = \u2212dx+ dx\u2212 + dxi dxi + \u03a6(\u03c1)\u03b4(x\u2212 )dx\u22122 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwith\n\u03a6(\u03c1) = \u22128GD \u03bc ln \u03c1 ,\n=\n\nD=4,\n\n16\u03c0GD \u03bc\n\u03a9D\u22123 (D \u2212 4)\u03c1D\u22124\n\n,\n\nD>4,\n\n(2.13)\n\nand x\u03bc = (x+ , x\u2212 , xi ), \u03c12 = xi xi , and \u03bc = E/2. Indeed, scattering of a test particle in this\nmetric straightforwardly yields a scattering angle agreeing with (2.7). Outside the future\nlightcone of the collision of the two sources, the classical geometry of the two-particle state\nis that of two such metrics, with centers offset by the impact parameter. This classical\ngeometry has been shown[20] (with recent confirmation by numerical relativity[24]) to form\nan apparent horizon, thus a black hole, for impact parameters b <\n\u223c R(E).\n\nSo, we expect the sum over tree diagrams connecting the high-energy sources to give\n\nthe classical metric in this case as well, and that the breakdown of the perturbative expansion is associated with the classical black hole formation.5\nIn the case of the eikonal amplitudes, the expansion parameter, there \u03c7, likewise\nbecame large, and a more careful way to handle that is to sum up the ladder diagrams\n5\n\nNote that one can consider either tree diagrams with all but one free \"field-point\" leg con-\n\nnected to the high-energy sources, which gives an analog to the calculation of the classical metric\nof [22], or with all legs connected to the external sources, corresponding to contributions to the\ntwo-two amplitude like in fig. 2. These are clearly related, and argued to have corresponding\ndivergences at (2.11).\n\n9\n\n\fto get the classical geometry of the Aichelburg-Sexl collision, and then do a perturbative\nexpansion about this classical geometry. One might guess that a similar procedure could\nbe followed in the strong-gravity case as well; in particular [25] has suggested that the\nseries can be resummed. However, comparison with the story of the point mass indicates\nthe apparent outcome: summing the tree diagrams corresponds to building up the classical\ngeometry of the collision and the resulting black hole. One could then try to perturbatively\nquantize fluctuations about this geometry.\nHere we encounter the unitarity problem, which is so profound it has lead to the\napparent paradox of black hole information. Specifically, such a perturbative quantization\nwas carried out by Hawking, with the conclusion that black holes evaporate[1], and that\nthe final state is mixed so that information is destroyed and unitary evolution fails[2]. This\nanalysis can be carried out even more explicitly in two-dimensional models [26,27].\n\nFig. 3: A Penrose diagram of an evaporating black hole, with one of a family\nof nice slices pictured.\n\nThis is not the place for a complete review (see [28,29]), but the basic arguments are as\nfollows. First, a family of spatial slices can be drawn through the black hole, avoiding the\nstrong curvature near the classical singularity, and crossing the horizon and asymptoting\nto a constant-time slice in the asymptotic flat geometry. One such slice is sketched in\n10\n\n\fFig. 3. These \"nice slices\" were described in [30], with one explicit construction in [31].\nLocality in field theory tells us that the state on such a slice can be represented as a sum\nof products of states in two Hilbert spaces, one corresponding to inside the black hole, and\none outside. Schematically, this can be written (for more detail, see [27])\n|\u03c8NS i \u223c\n\nX\ni\n\npi |iiin |iiout .\n\n(2.14)\n\nA description of the state outside the horizon is given by the density matrix formed by\ntracing out the inside states:\n\u03c1HR \u223c Trin |\u03c8NS ih\u03c8NS | .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThis is manifestly a mixed state. In fact, one can trace over all degrees of freedom that\nhave not left the vicinity of the black hole by a given time; e.g. one can describe the density\nmatrix on future null infinity as a function of the corresponding retarded time x\u2212 . This\ndensity matrix has an entropy S(x\u2212 ) = \u2212Tr[\u03c1(x\u2212 ) log \u03c1(x\u2212 )], and one straightforwardly\n\nestimates that it grows with x\u2212 to a value of order the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S(E) \u221d\nGD [R(E)]D\u22122 at a retarded time corresponding to the time the black hole evaporates to\n\nclose to the Planck size. This represents a huge missing information, which is also largely\nindependent of what was thrown into the black hole. The result is a modern update of\nHawking's original argument[2] for a unitarity crisis.\nThe problem with the story is that quantum mechanics is remarkably robust. Hawking\nproposed a linear evolution on density matrices, generalizing the S-matrix, but Banks,\nPeskin, and Susskind[32] argued that this causes severe problems with energy conservation.\nA basic argument is that information transfer and loss requires energy loss, and that once\nallowed, energy non-conservation will pollute all of physics through virtual effects. In\nparticular, [32] leads to the conclusion that the world would appear to be thermal at a\ntemperature T \u223c MD .\n\nThe obvious alternative is that information does not escape the black hole until it\n\nhas reached the Planck size, where the nice-slice argument manifestly fails. However, with\nan available decay energy \u223c MD and an information \u2206I \u223c S(E) to transmit to restore\npurity, on very general grounds this must take a very long time, \u223c S 2 . This implies very\n\nlong-lived, or perhaps stable, remnants, which come in O(exp S(E)) species to encode the\n\nlarge information content.\n\n11\n\n\fSince one can in principle consider an arbitrarily large initial black hole, the number\nof species is unboundedly large. This leads to unboundedly large inclusive pair production in generic processes with total available energy E \u226b MD , as well as problems with\n\ninconsistent renormalization of the Planck mass[33], etc. (The former problem can be seen\nparticularly clearly in the charged black hole sector[34], where one considers Schwinger\nproduction.)\n\nSo, information apparently cannot get out of a black hole, cannot be lost, and cannot\nbe left behind, and this is the essence of the \"paradox.\" It represents a deep conflict\nbetween basic principles of Lorentz/diffeomorphism invariance (on a macroscopic scale),\nquantum mechanics, and locality (also on a macroscopic scale).\nGiven the apparent robustness of quantum mechanics and of Lorentz invariance, and\nthe puzzling role of locality in gravity, it is natural to propose that the latter is not sharply\ndefined, and that this underlies an explanation of how unitarity is restored. If this is true,\nand black hole formation and evaporation is a unitary process, Page[35] has argued that\ninformation must begin to be emitted by the time scale\ntP age \u223c R(E)S(E) ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere the black hole has radiated an O(1) fraction of its mass. This indicates a needed\n\nbreakdown of the nice-slice argument, and some departure from locality as described in the\nsemiclassical picture of Fig. 3, over distances comparable to the black hole size, \u223c R(E) \u2013\n\nwhich can be a macroscopic scale.\n\nWhile other surprises in high-energy gravitational scattering are not unfathomable \u2013\nwe are still checking aspects of the picture outlined above \u2013 it seems clear that black holes\nalso form in collapse of massive bodies, yielding a variant of the preceding argument for a\nconflict between basic principles.\nWe will return to general questions with, and constraints on, this picture later, but\nthe immediate question is: what does string theory offer to improve it?\n2.4. A role for strings?\nStrings are extended objects, and this suggests that string theory does not have the\nsame locality properties as quantum field theory, and that the preceding picture could be\nmodified. Indeed, one might expect that strings can become highly excited and extended in\na high-energy collision, and it has occurred to various string theorists that this could change\n12\n\n\four story. In particular, it was suggested in [30] that string excitation and extendedness\ncould play a role in breakdown of the nice-slice argument, and in [36] that it could play a\nrole in how information escapes a black hole.\nWe have already given an argument that string corrections to the tree-level amplitude\ndo not significantly change the eikonal amplitude. However, another effect that we have\nneglected is excitation of a scattered string through coherent interaction with the gravitational field of the other high-energy string. Such effects were found to be present in [9].\nThey were later interpreted as due to tidal excitation[15]: if a composite object, whether\na hydrogen atom or a string, scatters off the AS metric (2.12), it experiences tidal forces,\nand can become excited. In the string case, there is a critical impact parameter, indicated\nby the dotted line in the right half of Fig. 1, and given by[9]\nbt \u2248\n\n1 \u0010\u221a \u2032 \u00112/(D\u22122)\n\u03b1E\n,\nMD\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere this becomes an important effect. The most extreme interpretation of this observation is that, due to string excitation, the picture we have given of gravitational scattering\ncannot be trusted, and is dominated by excited string effects.\nThis can be tested by explicit study of string scattering in an AS metric. Specifically,\none can adopt a \"probe\" approximation, in which the scattered string's backreaction on\nthe metric is neglected. Such an approximation naturally emerges at leading order in\nan expansion in small scattering angle \u03b8, and can be used to deduce the basic parameters\ngoverning excitation. The problem was studied in [16], which took advantage of the natural\nlight-cone structure of the AS metric (2.12) to explicitly quantize the string. The picture\nof tidal excitation was confirmed, as was the intuitive picture[15] that, once the string\nreceives a tidal \"kick\" from the metric, it spreads out only on a characteristic timescale,\ncomputed in[16]:\ntt \u223c\n\nbD\u22122\n\u221a\n.\nGD \u03b1\u2032 E 2\n\n(2.18)\n\nIn short, the string appears to behave in accord with basic intuitions of causality, and is\nnot instantaneously spread out by the collision.\nThis can be compared with the black hole formation. In a classical collision, in fact\nthe black hole (apparent horizon) forms before the AS shock waves meet, by a time of order\nR(E). Combining these observations, one has a picture in nice accord with causality. If\ntwo high-energy strings collide at impact parameters between bt and \u223c R(E), they become\n\nexcited, and this is important in description of the asymptotic state. (With finite string\n13\n\n\fcoupling, one expects decay to multiple asymptotic strings.) But, for impact parameters\n<\n\u223c R(E), a black hole forms before the strings meet the gravitational shock wave of their\ncounterpart. When they do meet, the strings becomes excited. But, they are then inside\na black hole. So far string behavior has been found to respect basic intuitions of causality,\nand in particular, we don't have any good evidence an excited string can escape a black\nhole \u2013 it would appear to behave a lot like any other extended object.\nWhile these statements do not rely on complete calculations, they do extrapolate sharp\ncalculations, and there is no sharp picture of effects that would modify them. In short,\nthere is no clear mechanism to prevent black hole formation, or to permit information\nescape, based on the extendedness of strings.\nSo far, we appear to conclude that string theory in fact does not lead to major modifications of the picture outlined in the preceding sections, and summarized in Fig. 1, aside\nfrom the tidal excitation of asymptotic states in the regime indicated. In fact, this story\nis related to the momentum fractionation described above, limiting the relevance of short\ndistance effects.\nMoreover, string theory appears to encounter the same divergence in the perturbation\nseries that was described above, at b \u223c R(E), associated with black hole formation \u2013 we\nhave found no way to avoid it.\n2.5. Summary\nTo summarize the situation, ultraplanckian scattering in the strong-gravity regime\nmanifests a unitarity crisis. This appears to be associated with a breakdown of perturbation\ntheory. These are long-distance issues, and appear essentially independent of the question\nof perturbative renormalizability \u2013 which has been a big motivator for string theory and\nother approaches to quantum gravity \u2013 or of other short distance effects. (For the same\nreason, one does not expect a rescue from loop quantum gravity, or asymptotic safety[18].)\nSpecifically, there are no indications that even order-by-order finiteness in perturbation\ntheory, as is expected in string theory (and possibly in in N = 8 supergravity[19]) addresses\nthe issue. We face what is apparently a non-perturbative problem, which seems to be a\ncentrally profound aspect of the problem of reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity.\n14\n\n\f3. Is there a decodable hologram?\nIf the improved behavior of perturbation theory in string theory doesn't address the\nissue of computing the S-matrix in the strong gravity regime, we apparently need a fully\nnon-perturbative definition of the theory. It has been proposed that dualities, most notably\nAdS/CFT, furnish such a definition. Indeed, for purposes of defining the S-matrix this\nseems the simplest duality, and other approaches appear to offer more difficulties, so it will\nbe examined as a proxy for more general dualities.\nAdS/CFT has been suggested as a concrete implementation of the proposal of\nholography[37,38], which in its strongest form states that a gravitational theory governing\na region of space has a completely equivalent theory on the lower-dimensional boundary of\nthat region. This proposal gives an idea for a kind of nonlocality that might address the\nunitarity problem of black holes. And, in AdS/CFT the boundary theory is N = 4 super\n\nYang-Mills with group SU(N), a theory that is well-defined in the sense that we could\npresumably put it on a computer, and so if the holographic proposal holds, this would give\na definition of string theory in asymptotically AdS space.\nClearly one would like to better understand the precise relationship between the theories, and this has been the subject of a lot of exploration. Our specific question is in\nwhat sense there is an equivalence between the theories, and whether this defines a good\napproximation to the flat-space S-matrix. If it does, we should be able to examine the\nproperties of this S-matrix, and understand the underlying non-local physics avoiding the\nunitarity problem. This is part of the problem of \"decoding the hologram.\" A possible\nalternative to consider[39] is that AdS/CFT is more like a projection, in the sense that\nnot all of the information of the bulk theory is contained in the boundary theory; for\nexample, the latter might only capture an appropriately coarse-grained description of the\nbulk physics, perhaps somewhat like low-energy effective field theories only capture the IR\ndynamics, and \"forget\" details of the short-distance physics.\nIf there is an equivalence, the boundary theory has a Hilbert space which we would\nexpect to correspond to that of the bulk, via a map\nM : HB \u2192 H\u2202\n\n(3.1)\n\nthat is one to one and unitary. The boundary theory also has a hamiltonian and thus\nunitary evolution operator U , which we would like to describe corresponding objects in\n15\n\n\fthe bulk. In particular, such a map M can be used to define a bulk evolution operator\nUB = M \u2020 U M which is unitary, UB\u2020 UB = 1.\nThe correlators in the boundary theory define a sort of AdS analog of the Smatrix[40]. In a complete equivalence between the two theories, we would also expect\nto be able to extract a good approximation to the flat space S-matrix, if the AdS radius\nR = (gY2 M N )1/4 lstring is large as compared to the string length lstring . Thus in the large-R\nlimit we would expect UB to determine S, such that S \u2020 S = 1.\nThere is no question that there are deep and useful relations between the bulk and\nboundary theories. But, the essential question is whether the bulk theory, and in particular\nits S-matrix, can be reconstructed in detail from the boundary theory. This has been\nactively investigated. The rest of this section will summarize some approaches to this\nproblem, some of the constraints and difficulties encountered, and possible conclusions.\n3.1. Normalizable states\nConsidering radial quantization in the conformal (boundary) theory, one can create\na state from the vacuum by acting with an operator at the origin of R4 , |\u03c8O i = O(0)|0i.\nThis can be conformally mapped to the cylinder, R \u00d7 S 3 , with the operator acting at\n\nt = \u2212\u221e. Under (3.1), such states should correspond to states of theory in the bulk of\nAdS, with R \u00d7 S 3 identified as the boundary.\n\nIn the case where the bulk string coupling, g = gY2 M , is taken to be zero, there have\n\nbeen checks that the resulting spectrum of free-particle states indeed corresponds to states\ncreated by such boundary operators; for a review, see [41]. However, given the relative\ntriviality of the free theory, a large part of this statement seems kinematical.\nTo isolate the S-matrix, one needs to consider the interacting theory, say with finite but\nsmall g; one naturally interprets (3.1) as a map between the states of the boundary theory\nand the interacting states of the bulk theory. However, this adds an essential complication.\nIn flat-space scattering, one can arrange a two-particle state such that the particles are\nwell-separated in the past, then collide, and scatter into other asymptotically separated\nparticles. But, for normalizable states in AdS, one expects trouble with such asymptotic\nseparation. Namely, as pictured in Fig. 4, such normalizable states are effectively confined\nto a box of size R for infinite time, and hence undergo infinitely many collisions. In this\nsense, interactions are not necessarily small \u2013 even for g \u226a 1 \u2013 for such states.\n\nIf we imagine that the AdS radius is large, say 1010 light years, what we would like\n\nto do is isolate the effects of one such collision, which might then be interpreted as giving\n16\n\n\fFig. 4: AdS behaves like a gravitational \"box\" of radius R; normalizable\nstates correspond to particles confined to the box, which undergo multiple\ncollisions.\n\na controlled approximation to the S-matrix. This suggests that one needs an analog of\nthe LSZ formalism of flat-space theory, in order to do so. Specifically, we would like to\nfind a state of the fully interacting Hilbert space HB that, at t = \u22121 year, looks like two\n\nincoming, essentially free particles, say in specific wavepackets, and at t = +1 year looks\n\nlike a state of some outgoing, far-separated particles.\nIf the state is normalizable and obtained from the preceding operator-state correspondence, this is challenging. The problem is unscrambling the infinite interactions to the\npast (or future) of our collision region. Specifically, if we attempt to use the g = 0 correspondence to tell us how to construct initial two-particle wavepackets of the desired kind,\nthe corresponding state in the interacting theory will receive corrections from the infinite\nreflections and interactions pictured in Fig. 4.\nThe problem of isolating states of the kind described, in order to approximate the\nS-matrix, remains an open question. One recent proposal[42] suggests a way scattering\namplitudes (reduced transition matrix elements) might be extracted, but it is not clear\nthat it truly overcomes the \"multiple collision\" problem, and suffices to fully determine a\nclose approximation to the S-matrix.\n3.2. Boundary compact states\nAn apparently more promising proposal for defining the S-matrix was made by\nPolchinski[43] and Susskind[44]: excitations created at the boundary of AdS can be allowed\n17\n\n\fto scatter, and then the S-matrix can be \"measured\" by boundary operators sensitive to\nthe state after the collision. Specifically, if b denotes a boundary point, one can integrate\nagainst a source function f (b),\nZ\n\ndbf (b)O(b)|0i\n\n(3.2)\n\nto create such an excitation.\nSuppose we choose coordinates where the AdSd+1 metric is\nds2 =\n\n\u0001\nR2\n\u2212d\u03c4 2 + d\u03c12 + sin2 \u03c1d\u03a92d\u22121 .\n2\ncos \u03c1\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe prescription found by Gubser, Polyakov, Klebanov, and Witten[45,46] then gives the\nbulk wavefunction of the field corresponding to O, via the bulk-boundary propagator:\nZ\n\u03c8f (x) = db\u2032 f (b\u2032 )GB\u2202 (b\u2032 , x) .\n(3.4)\nThe asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction corresponding to (3.2), with operator dimen\u221a\nsion \u2206 (related to the bulk mass by 2\u2206 = d + d2 + 4m2 R2 ), is\n\u03c1\u2192\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c8f (x) \u2212\u2192\n\n(cos \u03c1)d\u2212\u2206\nf (b) .\nR(d\u22121)/2\n\n(3.5)\n\nThis has nonnormalizable behavior when approaching points on the boundary in the support of f , and so in order to create a state of the bulk Hilbert space, in the sense that it\nis normalizable at some time \u03c4 , f must have compact support.\n\nFig. 5: The picture for a proposed derivation of the S-matrix from boundarycompact sources which produce particles at spatial infinity.\n\n18\n\n\fRef. [47] gave a construction of such sources designed to produce localized wavepackets in the bulk, and to test the proposal to extract the S-matrix as sketched in Fig. 5.\nSpecifically, these \"boundary-compact\" sources take the form\nf (b) = L(\u03c4, \u00ea)e\u00b1i\u03c9R\u03c4 ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere L(\u03c4, \u00ea) is sharply peaked near a point b0 = (\u03c40 , \u00ea0 ), with widths \u2206\u03c4 and \u2206\u03b8, and\nhas compact support, and \u03c9 gives the typical energy of the wavepacket seen by a central\nobserver at \u03c1 \u226a 1.\n\nFor such narrowly-peaked sources (compact support or not), a simple, explicit expres-\n\nsion can be found for the corresponding wavepackets in the flat region \u03c1 \u226a 1, generalizing\n[48].

Then F\nwill not have compact support. This excludes the kinds of wavepackets used in careful treatments of scattering[49], specifically the regular wavepackets, which have support\nthat is compact in momentum space and excludes zero frequency. Conversely, compactly\nsupported F means noncompact f .6\nThis appears to be an obstacle to approximating the usual Hilbert space of bulk states,\nin the limit of large R. One can ask how boundary-compact wavepackets are different from\nmore familiar (e.g. gaussian) wavepackets. They do have characteristic longitudinal and\ntransverse widths, given by\n\u2206t \u2248 R\u2206\u03c4 , \u2206x\u22a5 \u223c 1/\u2206p\u22a5 \u223c 1/(\u03c9\u2206\u03b8) .\n\n(3.13)\n\nBut outside these widths, one finds[48] that they have power-law tails, with characteristic\nfalloff in both longitudinal and transverse directions\n\u03c8f \u223c 1/r \u2206 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nWithout the \"sharper\" regular wavepackets, one should reconsider how to give a careful description of scattering; there is potential for trouble in precisely approximating the\nS-matrix. For example[48], these tails hinder separation of the \"scattered\" contribution\nfrom the \"direct\" contribution to S. This issue might be addressed by subtraction of the\ndisconnected correlators directly in the boundary theory,7 e.g. for the four-point function\nhO1 O2 O3 O4 ic = hO1 O2 O3 O4 i \u2212 hO1 O2 ihO3 O4 i \u2212 hO1 O3 ihO2 O4 i \u2212 hO1 O4 ihO2 O3 i .\n\n(3.15)\n\nBut, returning to one of our basic motivations, note that one expects the gravitational\nS-matrix in the strong gravity regime to have entries exponentially small in the entropy,\nwhich is a power of the energy. Specifically, the amplitude to form a black hole and\n6\n\nOne also might try semicompact sources like those described in [50]. The expression (3.11)\n\nwould not give compact F , but needs to be modified to take into account the extent of the source.\nThis remains an open question, though one also expects to encounter difficulties either like those\noutlined in the previous or next subsections.\n7\n\nI thank T. Okuda and J. Polchinski for discussions on this point.\n\n20\n\n\fthen have it decay back to a typical multi-particle final state is of order e\u2212S/2 . The\n\"meat\" of the unitarity problem is in matrix elements of this size; making errors in the\ndensity matrix of the final state of this size can make the difference between having a\npure state and a mixed state like described by Hawking. With a Hilbert space including\ngaussian wavepackets, one can approach this kind of resolution. However, the tails (3.14)\nwould appear to impede resolution of such small S-matrix elements. Specifically, they are\nexpected to give larger amplitudes for two colliding particles to miss entering the strong\ngravity regime, and instead scatter by a longer-range gravitational process.8\nEven if one puts these questions aside, a puzzling question is how interactions purely\nin the boundary theory could \"mock-up\" the correct local scattering in the bulk. For\nexample, if by adjusting f and thus F , we change the trajectory of a particle slightly,\n\u03b4(impact parameter) <<< R, so that it no longer collides with another, the scattering\nbehavior is completely different. Yet, in the boundary theory, the corresponding state is\nspread in a complicated way over the boundary at the collision time[48].\nSome more precise necessary conditions on the requisite boundary behavior can be\nfound. For example, in order to correctly reproduce a momentum-conserving delta function, in a plane-wave limit, the four-point correlator (3.15) should have a specific kind of\nsingular behavior described in [47]. This is not directly related to the operator-product\nlimit where two boundary points coincide, but occurs when the boundary points are lightlike related to a common bulk point. Moreover, to produce e.g. the Born behavior (2.2),\nthe correlator must also have a specific kind of subleading singularity. If these behaviors are\npresent, one can extract the reduced transition matrix elements, in a plane-wave limit[47].\nOne can ask about the origin of such singular behavior, from the boundary perspective.\nIn particular, [51] has formulated a conjecture that a CFT that has a large-N expansion,\nand in which single-trace operators of spin > 2 have parametrically large dimensions, will\nexhibit the leading singularity, and has given some supporting evidence for this conjecture.\nBut, in view of the above discussion, the question of extracting the full S-matrix this way\nremains an open problem.\n8\n\nFor a gaussian wavepacket, the longitudinal width of the packet must satisfy \u2206t >\n\u223c 1/\u2206E >\n\n1/E, which places a bound on the amplitude for tails of wavepackets colliding at zero impact\n2\nparameter to be \"outside\" the horizon: A \u223c exp{\u2212[R(E)]2/\u2206t2 } >\n\u223c exp{\u2212S }. Similar arguments\ncan be given for transverse widths.\n\n21\n\n\f3.3. Noncompact sources\nThe problematic nature of boundary-compact wavepackets encourages closer examination of sources without compact support. From the boundary perspective, these do not\ncreate states, but rather deformations of the theory. In particular, quantities like\nhO(b)\n\nZ\n\ndb\u2032 f (b\u2032 )O(b\u2032 )i ,\n\n(3.16)\n\ndiverge. These also do not create states in the original bulk Hilbert space; total particle\nnumber diverges near the boundary. This latter property naively impedes focussing of\ninteractions near the \"center\" of AdS, as we needed to derive the S-matrix. Specifically,\nbulk correlators will include expressions like\nZ\n\ndV \u03c8NN \u03c8NN GBulk ,\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere the bulk Green function is integrated against a pair of non-normalizable wavefunctions, producing a divergence near the boundary, corresponding to infinite interaction\namplitude there.\nHowever, gravity is special; its effective coupling is proportional to the energy. Specifically, the (super)graviton couples through the (super)stress tensor. For a state with a fixed\nenergy at the center of AdS, the proper stress tensor seen by observers near the boundary redshifts to zero as the boundary is approached, allowing the analogous expression to\n(3.17), with stress tensor integrated against graviton propagator, to converge[52]9 despite\nthe infinite particle number. This allows finite integrals of the corresponding connected\nfour-point function (3.15) against non-compact sources.\nAn interesting question is how such quantities could be interpreted as a bulk S-matrix,\nin view of the nonnormalizability. One apparently lacks a normalization condition, and\nmore generally formulating the unitarity condition S \u2020 S = 1, which apparently requires a\nsum over intermediate normalizable states, is a challenge. These issues (and a related question of whether an analogous unitarity condition can be formulated directly for correlators)\nwill be discussed elsewhere[52].\n9\n\nI thank J. Polchinski and M. Gary for discussions on this point.\n\n22\n\n\f3.4. Summary\nI have summarized investigation of the problem of \"decoding the hologram,\" specifically by extracting the bulk S-matrix. There are a variety of necessary conditions that\nneed to be satisfied. In particular, one would need the boundary theory to not only have\na large-N expansion, but also to yield a specific hierarchy of dimensions and produce certain specific leading and subleading singularities[47,51]. The boundary dynamics needs to\nreproduce interactions that behave approximately locally from the bulk viewpoint. And,\none seemingly needs a method to isolate good approximations to the flat S-matrix. This\nrequires a resolution of either the \"multiple-interaction problem,\" the \"tail problem,\" or\nthe \"non-normalizability problem\" of the preceding sections.\nUnitarity of the boundary theory is often heard equated to unitarity of the bulk\ntheory, but as has been illustrated, attempts to implement such statements in detail to\napproximate a unitary bulk S-matrix run into difficulties. One may view these as merely\ntechnical difficulties \u2013 in which case one should resolve them.\nOr, perhaps they are of a more fundamental nature, and are telling us that the\nAdS/CFT correspondence does not define all the quantities we need to describe the bulk\ntheory. Clearly the correspondence has a lot of power, and has produced surprising connections between bulk and boundary physics. However, these may (at least partially)\nresult from universality and symmetry, which are powerful principles. It is not clear why\nthe boundary theory should completely produce bulk physics with the correct (approximately) local interactions. An alternative possibility[39] is that the boundary theory\nprovides a sort of effective theory, or thermodynamic description, which only furnishes a\nkind of coarse-grained version of the bulk dynamics, and in particular does not give a finegrained S-matrix satisfying S \u2020 S = 1. We do not yet have a \"no-go\" theorem for decoding\nthe hologram \u2013 but we have found some apparently significant challenges to the proposed\nequivalence.\nIndeed, if the correspondence were complete, we would expect it to address a kind of\nquestion on which it has so far been largely silent. Namely, in physics we make observations\nthat are approximately local in spacetime, and we do not observe an S-matrix at infinity.\nWe turn next to this question.\n23\n\n\f4. The problem of local observables\nTo explain what we see, physics apparently needs a way of describing the observations\nof a localized observer, whether that observer is viewing fluctuations in their expanding\ncosmos, or falling towards the center of a black hole. While there are some ideas how\none might find certain localized observables in AdS/CFT (for example, associated with\npositions of branes), this is very much an unresolved problem.\nIndeed, this is a general problem in gravity. While in field theory one can construct\nlocal gauge-invariant observables from fields, the low-energy gauge symmetry of gravity is\ndiffeomorphisms, under which such a local operator will not be gauge invariant:\n\u03b4\u03be O(x) = \u03be \u03bc \u2202\u03bc O(x) 6= 0 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nString theory largely sidesteps this question, in describing an S-matrix.\nSince we seem to need to make predictions about such observations within an ultimate\ntheory containing gravity, particularly in the cosmological context, we expect a complete\ntheory of quantum gravity to explain how such local observables arise, at least in an\napproximation. Note that we also expect this from correspondence of such a theory with\nfield theory in the correspondence limit GD \u2192 0.\n\nThe idea for how this could work goes back to at least Leibniz and Einstein, with\n\nmodern additions by DeWitt and others. Specifically, localization of phenomena in space\nand time is taken to be in relation to other features of the state describing the Universe.\nWe can explain some of the ideas for how this works, in the context of a low-energy\neffective description, although a key question is how these ideas are implemented in a more\nfundamental and complete theory. In particular, the diffeomorphism symmetry implies\nthat configurations must satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity, which in\nthe quantum context give us the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We can have a solution to\nthis equation that nonetheless has non-trivial features in it, e.g. cosmological fluctuations,\ngalaxies, and planets. This is somewhat like a spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism\nsymmetry. And, in such a state we can localize observables relative to those features.\nSpecifically, let |\u03a8i denote a solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation,\nHW D |\u03a8i = 0 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nOne seeks operators O that are gauge invariant, in particular satisfy [HW D , O] = 0, and\n\nthat in appropriate states approximately reduce to local operators,\nh\u03a8|O|\u03a8i \u2248 hO(x0 )i ,\n24\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fwhere the point x0 is selected by a feature in the state. Ref. [53] outlines how such operators\nmight be constructed in the effective field theory approximation, for example as integrals\nof the form\nO=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\ndD x \u2212gB(x)O(x)\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere B(x) is an operator selecting a certain feature of \"background\" fields at, say, point\nx0 . Ref. [53] contains more detailed examples of these and other kinds of relational observables. Another example is provided by current studies of cosmological fluctuations, in the\nsemiclassical limit. The underlying dynamics respects diffeomorphism symmetry, implying\nin particular a question of how to specify \"time.\" In the context of slow-roll inflation, a\ncommon choice is to define time slices by constant values of the inflaton field. This in\nparticular plays a physical role in computing a fluctuation spectrum at \"reheating,\" which\nis where the inflaton reaches a specific value \u03c6RH where inflation ends.\nOne would like to understand how such ideas could be implemented in string theory,\nwhether in AdS/CFT or in some more general formulation. If AdS/CFT were to encode\nall details of bulk dynamics, it might for example be natural to look at certain relationallyspecified quantities involving the matrix degrees of freedom (which are acted on only by the\nboundary gauge transformations). In the absence of such constructions in string theory, it\nis difficult to view string theory as providing a complete quantum theory of gravity.\nIn particular, descriptions of local observations would seem to be needed for a picture\nthat fully addresses the black hole information \"paradox.\" The essential tension that we\nhave outlined arises when one attempts to give a description of both the physics seen by\ninfalling observers, and by observers outside the black hole. While an S-matrix description\nof the process of formation and evaporation of a black hole would give very important\nclues, more is needed in order to understand the precise way in which a unitary picture\nemerges and departs from the semiclassical (and local) arguments for information loss.\nThe most promising approach to describing such localized observations appears to be via\na realization of the relational ideas that have been outlined.\nIt is amusing to note in this connection that once again string theory certainly serves\nas a source of inspiration and ideas: in particular, since world-sheet dynamics involves an\nimplementation of 1 + 1-dimensional diffeomorphism symmetry, we should be able to find\nsuch constructions for \"observers\" on the string world sheet! Such a toy model for the\nbasic picture we have outlined was in fact developed in [54], based on string methods. In\nparticular, familiar vertex operators of string theory supply operators of the general form\n(4.4).\n25\n\n\fFinally, note that a proper formulation of such operators in the cosmological context\nmight go a long ways towards addressing the \"measure\" problems in inflationary cosmology,\nwhose puzzles and paradoxes appear to stem dominantly from large IR effects. One expects\nthese could be tamed in a consistent and complete formulation of such observables.\nStudying the problem of observables and studying scattering are complementary approaches to the problems of quantum gravity; a better understanding of local observables is\nlikely to shed further light on properties, particularly unitarity, of the S-matrix, and on the\nother hand understanding scattering is likely to help us with the problems of cosmology.\n\n5. Outlook\nTo summarize the situation, string theory has been a continuous source of new ideas\nin mathematics and physics, and showed a lot of initial promise for resolving the problems\nof quantum gravity. However, the more profound problems are yet to be convincingly\naddressed, and there are deep puzzles about how they might be addressed by string theory.\nIf string theory is to be (at least) a prescription for defining a gravitational S-matrix,\nit apparently needs to do so in the ultraplanckian regime. While its addressing nonrenormalizability seemed initially very promising, we have argued that a deeper problem that\nis exhibited in this regime is that of unitarity. The corresponding strong gravity dynamics\nappears to represent a serious breakdown of perturbation theory \u2013 presenting a deep conflict between very basic fundamental principles, and requiring a non-perturbative definition\nof the theory.\nAdS/CFT and similar dualities were initially hailed as promising ways to provide such\na non-perturbative definition. But, as I have outlined, the problem of extracting detailed\nbulk quantities \u2013 such as the flat-space S-matrix, reveals significant difficulties. It remains\nto be seen if these are surmountable, or whether such dualities only hold at an effective or\nappropriately coarse-grained level.\nIn particular, for cosmology and to match experience, we also seek a definition of\nother quantities that are more general than the S-matrix, and describe local observation,\nin some approximation. So far, this question has been largely avoided in string theory.\nIt is important to consider more generally the outlines of physics that could address\nthese questions, whether this physics is string theory or something else. One guide is the\nshape of our ignorance \u2013 where do our familiar constructs of local quantum field theory\nfail? Exploring a possible analogy between this and the description of the correspondence\n26\n\n\fboundary between classical physics and quantum mechanics, an answer to this question\nwould be an analog of stating the uncertainty principle. There have been string-motivated\nproposals of this nature, particularly the string uncertainty principle[55,56],\n\u2206X \u2265\n\n1\n+ \u03b1\u2032 \u2206p .\n\u2206p\n\n(5.1)\n\nBut, a different way to look at the problem is to ask when familiar constructs of field theory\nbreak down due to strong gravitational effects. Lorentz invariance suggests that one can\nboost a single particle to arbitrary energy (and appears at odds with (5.1)). But, if one\nconsiders a two-particle Fock space state, for example with particles with approximately\ndefinite momenta and positions,\n\u03c6k,x \u03c6k\u2032 ,x\u2032 |0i\n\n(5.2)\n\na local quantum-field theoretic description would appear to fail when\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |D\u22123 > G|k + k \u2032 |\n\n(5.3)\n\nis violated, where G \u223c GD h\u0304. This proposed limitation on the dynamical description of\n\nQFT, Fock space states, is called the locality bound[57], and generalizes to a statement\nfor N particles[15], and for de Sitter space[58].\n\nMerely knowing where local QFT fails is an important clue, but one needs to find the\nunderlying mathematical framework and dynamics of a more complete theory. Using again\nthe analogy of quantum mechanics, one needed to deduce that phase space is replaced by\nthe Hilbert space of quantum wavefunctions, governed by (e.g.) Schr\u00f6dinger mechanics.\nAnother important hint could come from asking how this dynamics could depart from the\nsemiclassical/local QFT description of dynamical geometry. One does find indications[59]\nof a breakdown of this description of black-hole evaporation, on the time scale (2.16), and\nof a similar breakdown in inflationary evolution[59,60].\nIn the black hole case, one would like to understand what kind of modification of the\nsemiclassical picture could give rise to a unitary S-matrix. In particular, there is the picture\ndescribed as black hole complementarity[61], stating that observables inside and outside the\nblack hole are not independent, and this picture fits with the ideas of holography. But, the\npicture suggests return of the information carried by a qubit that falls into the black hole\non a characteristic retention timescale tret \u223c R log R (see, e.g., [62]), much shorter than\n(2.16), and thus represents a very radical departure from Hawking's original prediction\n27\n\n\fbased on local QFT, tret = \u221e. A seemingly more conservative possibility[31] is that the\ninformation only leaks out on the timescale given by (2.16).\n\nOther possibly important clues come from \"parameterizing our ignorance\" of an Smatrix governing gravitational scattering, for example in two-two processes[17,21]. If there\nis such a quantum-mechanical description, and it has basic coarse-grained properties of\nlong-distance gravity, particularly black hole formation and evaporation, this has potentially important implications in properties of the S-matrix and of the underlying theory.\nSuch a parameterization does suggest nonlocality, making its appearance in the S-matrix\nthrough nonpolynomiality. In gravity, the important property of crossing symmetry is\nmore subtle than in massive theories, but there are indications of a story consistent with\ncrossing, which then constrains possible acausal behavior. Put together, one has a suggested picture where nonlocality is allowed without encountering acausality[21,31,5].\nA clear question is to provide a sensible mechanical description of such physics, which\nwould stand at odds with the usual local picture when viewed from the perspective of the\nsemiclassical geometry of the evaporating black hole. As we have described above, locality\nis not expected to be a precise notion in quantum gravity; in particular, if localization is\nonly defined relative to other features in the state, those features can fluctuate as well. But,\ntampering with locality is dangerous \u2013 in field theory, locality and causality are intimately\nlinked, and acausality appears to imply inconsistency. Nonetheless, as indicated, it may\nbe possible to walk a fine line between locality and inconsistency.\nWe seek a consistent framework for describing quantum processes, in which spacetime\nlocality emerges in an approximation. This, together with the requirement that it produce\nan S-matrix (and other local dynamics) with familiar properties of gravity seems a very tall\norder. This is actually encouraging, as it suggests the problem is sufficiently constrained\nto guide the resolution of this profoundly challenging set of problems. It remains to be\nseen what role string theory plays in this, and whether it can provide further clues.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the Department of Energy under Contract DEFG02-91ER40618.
