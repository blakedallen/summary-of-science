In\nthis modification of the standard theory, its manifest covariance, renormalizability, gauge invariance\nand unitarity are retained, and no new observable particles are introduced.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe standard theory of elementary particle physics (electroweak theory plus quantum chromodynamics) is a very successful theory. It is formulated as a local quantum field theory\nin 4-dimensional spacetime\n\n1),2)\n\nand its predictions have no clear contradictions with high-\n\nenergy experimental results, provided that right-handed neutrinos are taken into account.\nThis theory has the following fundamental properties:\n1. Its Lagrangian density is manifestly covariant.\n2. It is renormalizable.\n3. It is invariant under SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge transformations.\n4. Its physical S-matrix is unitary, though indefinite metric is used for BRS quantization\nof gauge fields.\nThe SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y gauge invariance is spontaneously broken up to U (1)em by Higgs\nmechanism. Higgs field has four real field-degrees of freedom; three of them are NambuGoldstone bosons, which are unphysical owing to the Kugo-Ojima subsidiary condition, and\nthe remaining one is a massive scalar boson called Higgs boson. In order to give nonzero\nmasses to leptons and quarks, it is assumed that there is a Yukawa interaction between Higgs\nfield and each of them; the mass is essentially a product of the Yukawa coupling constant\nand the vacuum expecation value of Higgs field. This Yukawa interaction causes quadratic\ndivergences in the self-energy part of Higgs boson.\n1 Professor\n\nEmeritus of Kyoto University. E-mail: nbr-nak@trio.plala.or.jp\n\n1\n\n\fBecause the standard theory is renormalizable, the renormalized S-matrix is finite to\nall orders of perturbation theory. But if one wishes to discuss radiative masses, one must\nintroduce a cutoff parameter \u039b. If \u039b is taken to be of order of Planck mass, quadratically\ndivergent quantities give uncontrollably large contributions. This trouble is known as the\nhierarchy problem. It may be resolved by the supersymmetric theory (SUSY), but since\nno superparticles are not yet observed at all, it is quite unlikely that SUSY is realized in\nNature.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to propose a possible modification of the standard\ntheory for removing the quadratic divergences caused by the Yukawa interactions, in such\na way that the above-mentioned fundamental properies are retained and that no new observable particles are necessary to be introduced. As is well known, ultraviolet divergences\ncan be removed by the regulator method (though it is quite nontrivial to remove all divergences so as to be consistent with non-abelian gauge invariance), but the introduction of\nindefinite metric usually violates the unitarity of the physical S-matrix. As was emphasized\npreviously,3),4) however, complex-ghost quantum field theory does not violate the unitarity,\nbecause complex ghosts cannot appear\n\n2\n\nin the final state if they are absent in the initial\n\nstate, owing to energy conservation law. Although Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix is\nknown to be violated in this theory, the amount of the violation can be made small by\nappropriately choosing a certain parameter that characterizes the imaginary part of the\ncomplex-ghost mass. Accordinly, it is quite an attractive possibility to use complex ghosts\nas regulators. In the present paper, we show that the complex-ghost regulater method\ncan remove the quadratic divergences caused by Yukawa interactions without violating the\nabove-mentioned fundamental properties of the standard theory.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, the standard theory is very briefly\nreviewed. In \u00a73, we present the theory of complex-ghost regulators. In \u00a74, we show how the\n\nquadratic divergences caused by Yukawa interactions can be removed by the complex-ghost\nregulators.\n\n2\n\nStandard theory\n\nThe Lagrangian density of the standard theory consists of gauge-field part, lepton part,\nquark part and Higgs part. In the present paper, as we discuss Yukawa interactions, lepton\npart and quark part only are explicitly considered.\nThe lepton-part Lagrangian density is written as a sum over three generations \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 .\n2 Precisely speaking, the probability with which a pair of a complex ghost and its complex-conjugate ghost\nappear is of measure zero.\n\n2\n\n\fIn each generation, the left-handed charged lepton \u03b1L and the left-handed neutrino \u03bd\u03b1L\nconstitute an SU (2)L doublet l\u03b1 with a hypercharge Y = \u22121/2, while the right-handed\ncharged lepton \u03b1R constitutes an SU (2)L singlet with Y = \u22121. Furthermore, recent neutrino\n\n\u2032\noscillation experiments5) require the introduction of the right-handed neutrino \u03bd\u03b1R\n, which\n\nis an SU (2)L singlet with Y = 0, and of the unitary neutrino-mixing matrix U = (U\u03b1\u03b2 ).\nP\nWe denote \u03b2 U\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bd\u03b2 by \u03bd \u0303\u03b2 and l\u03b1 with \u03bd \u0303\u03b1 in place of \u03bd\u03b1 by l\u0303\u03b1 ; we set l\u0302\u03b1 = (U \u22121 l\u0303)\u03b1 . The\nHiggs field \u03a6 is an SU (2)L doublet with Y = 1/2, and we set \u03a6\u0303 = i\u03c42 \u03a6\u2217 .\nThe lepton-part Lagrangian density is given by\nLlepton =\n\nX \u0002\n\n\u03b1=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nl\u0303\u03b1 i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bcL+Y  \u0303l\u03b1 + r \u03b1 i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bcY r\u03b1 + r \u2032\u03b1 i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc r\u03b1\u2032\n\u2020\n\n+(\u2212f\u03b1 ){(l\u0302\u03b1 \u03a6)r\u03b1 + r \u03b1 (\u03a6 l\u0302\u03b1 )} +\n\n(\u2212f\u03b1\u2032 ){(l\u0303\u03b1 \u03a6\u0303)r\u03b1\u2032\n\n+\n\nr\u2032\u03b1 (\u03a6\u0303\u2020 l\u0303\u03b1 )}\n\n(2.1)\n\u0003\n,\n\nwhere D\u03bcL+Y and D\u03bcY denote covariant differentiations with respect to SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y and\nU (1)Y , respectively.\nThe quark-part Lagrangian density has essentially the same form as the lepton-part\none does, except for the fact that the former has the color degrees of freedom, which is\ninessential to the present work. The \"upper\" quarks {u, c, t} and the \"lower\" quarks {d,\ns, b} correspond to the charged antileptons {e, \u03bc, \u03c4 } and to the antineutrinos {\u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc , \u03bd \u03c4 },\nrespectively. In this correspondence, the values of the hypercharge should be changed as\nYquark = Yantilepton \u2212 1/3.\nThe lower component of the Higgs field \u03a6 acquires a nonvanishing vacuum expectation\n\u221a\nvalue v/ 2 (v > 0); hence the vacuum expectation value of the upper component of \u03a6\u0303\n\u221a\nis also v/ 2. If \u03a6 is reexpressed in terms of v and four hermitian fields (Higgs boson and\n3-component Nambu-Goldstone boson), the quadratic part of Llepton becomes the free Dirac\nLagrangian density for all leptons, modified by neutrino mixing. The mass m\u03b1 of a charged\n\u221a\nlepton \u03b1 is given by f\u03b1 v/ 2. As for neutrinos, we encounter neutrino-mixing mass matrix,\nM. Likewise for Lquark .\n\n3\n\nComplex-ghost regulators\n\nWe introduce pairs of Weyl-spinor fields Lj (SU (2)L doublet, Y = \u22121/2), Rj (SU (2)L\n\nsinglet, Y = \u22121) and Rj\u2032 (SU (2)L singlet, Y = 0) (j = 1, 2); the j = 1 fields have positive\n\nnorm, while the j = 2 ones have negative norm.

We set\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nf11 v/ 2 = m1 , f22 v/ 2 = \u2212m2 , f12 v/ 2 = \u03b3/2;\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf11\nv/ 2 = m\u20321 , f22\nv/ 2 = \u2212m\u20322 , f12\nv/ 2 = \u03b3 \u2032 /2.\n\n(3.2)\n\nThen the quadratic part of (3.1) becomes\nL0regulator =\n\n2\nX\n\n(\u22121)j\u22121 (\u03a8 j i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03a8j \u2212 mj \u03a8 j \u03a8j ) \u2212\n\n+\n\n2\nX\n\n\u2032\n(\u22121)j\u22121 (\u03a8 j i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03a8j\u2032\n\nj=1\n\n\u2212\n\nj=1\n\n\u2032\nm\u2032j \u03a8 j \u03a8j\u2032 )\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u2217\n\u03a8 1 \u03a82 \u2212 \u03a8 2 \u03a81\n2\n2\n\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2032 \u2032\n\u03b3\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2212 \u03a8 1 \u03a82\u2032 \u2212\n\u03a8 \u03a8 ,\n2\n2 2 1\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03a8j is composed of the upper component of Lj and Rj and \u03a8j\u2032 is composed of the lower\ncomponent of Lj and Rj\u2032 .\nThe field equations derived from (3.3) are\n\u03b3\n\u03a82 = 0,\n2\n\u03b3\u2217\n(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m2 )\u03a82 + \u03a81 = 0.\n2\n(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m1 )\u03a81 \u2212\n\n(3.4)\n\nCanonical quantization is performed with \"wrong statistics\", that is, we set up commutation relations but not anticommutation relations:\n[\u03a8j (x), \u03a8 k (y)]x0 =y0 = (\u22121)j\u22121 \u03b3 0 \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\n=0\n\n(j = k)\n\n(3.5)\n\n(j 6= k).\n\nThen we set up a Cauchy problem for the 4-dimensional commutators\n[\u03a8j (x), \u03a8 k (y)] \u2261 iSjk (x \u2212 y).\n\n(3.6)\n\nAs was done previously,6),7) the solution to the Cauchy problem is easily found by diagonalizing the mass matrix\nM=\nThe eigenvalues become complex if\n\n\u0012\n\nm1\n\u03b3/2\n\u2212\u03b3 \u2217 /2 m2\n\n|\u03b3| > |m1 \u2212 m2 |.\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.7)\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fThen we obtain the complex masses M and M \u2217 , where\nM\u2261\n\nm1 + m2\nip \u2217\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2 .\n+\n2\n2\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2217\n= trM 2 .\n2\n\n(3.10)\n\nHence,\nM 2 + M \u22172 = m21 + m22 \u2212\n\n(+)\n\nWe can then construct the Wightman functions Sjk (x\u2212y) and the Feynman propagator\nSF jk (x \u2212 y) quite analogously to the case of the scalar complex ghost. But we do not need\ntheir explicit expressions for the present purpose.\nThe same procedure as above is carried out for primed quantities. That is, corresponding\nto (3.4) - (3.10), the equations in which \u03a8j , mj , \u03b3, Sjk , M and M are replaced by the\nrespective primed ones hold.\nFurthermore, for the quark part, everything goes quite analogously to the above consideration on the lepton part. Of course, in the quark case, the complex-ghost regulators have\nthe color degrees of freedom.\n\n4\n\nRemoval of quadratic divergences\n\nAs is well known, the appearance of quadratic divergences in the standard theory is only in\nthe proper self-energy part of Higgs boson. In the present paper, we discuss the quadratic\ndivergences caused by the Yukawa interaction. That is, we consider only the self-energy\nFeynman diagrams in which the end vertices of both external Higgs-boson lines correspond\nto Yukawa interactions.\nThe internal-line part of such a Feynman diagram consist of a lepton or quark loop\ntogether with radiative corrections. Because of the Fermi statistics of leptons and quarks,\nthis loop gives an overall factor \u22121 to the Feynman integral. On the other hand, the Feynman\ndiagram that has a complex-ghost regulator loop acquires no such a factor because of the Bose\nstatistics of the regulator fields. Furthermore, it is important to note that as far as quadratic\ndivergences are concerned, the mass term of any Feynman propagator is irrelevant ; that is,\nwe may forget about the mass except for the fact that each Yukawa coupling constant is\nproportional to a mass (or mass matrix element).\nWe first consider the second-order self-energy parts. The contribution from the charged\nP\nlepton-loop diagrams is proportional to \u2212 \u03b1 m2\u03b1 . The contribution from the corresponding\nregulator-loop diagrams is proportional to\n2\nf11\n\n+ 2(\u22121)f12 f21 +\n\n2\n(\u22121)2 f22\n\n=\n5\n\n\u0012\n\nv\n\u221a\n2\n\n\u0013\u22122 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2217\n2\n2\nm1 + m2 \u2212\n.\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fHere the factor \u22121 is due to the indefinite metric appearing in (3.3). Hence the quadratic\ndivergence caused by three charged leptons is cancelled if\nX\nm2\u03b1 = M 2 + M \u22172\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u03b1\n\nLikewise, the quadratic divergence caused by three neutrinos is cancelled if\n2\n\n\u22172\n\ntrM2 = M \u2032 + M \u2032 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere M denotes the neutrino-mixing mass matrix.\nUnfortunately, for higher-order self-energy diagrams, such a simple cancellation condition\nas above is no longer valid. In order to realize the removal of quadratic divergences to all\norders, we must introduce complex-ghost regulator fields for each generation. That is, we\nmust replace (3.1) by\nX \u0010 X\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\u22121)j\u22121 L\u0303\u03b1j i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bcL+Y L\u0303\u03b1j + R\u03b1j i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bcY R\u03b1j + R\u03b1j i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc R\u03b1j\nLregulator =\n\u03b1=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n+\n\nj=1,2\n\n2\nX\n\u0002\n(\u2212f\u03b1jk ){(L\u0302\u03b1j \u03a6)R\u03b1k + R\u03b1j (\u03a6\u2020 L\u0302\u03b1k )}\n\nj,k=1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+ R\u03b1j (\u03a6\u0303\u2020 L\u0303\u03b1k )}\n+ (\u2212f\u03b1jk\n){(L\u0303\u03b1j \u03a6\u0303)R\u03b1k\n\n\u0003\u0011\n\n,\n(4.4)\n\nwhere notation will be obvious from the above consideration.\nThen, for example, for a charged lepton \u03b1, (4.2) should be replaced by\nm2\u03b1 = M\u03b12 + M\u03b1\u22172\n\nfor each \u03b1,\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere M\u03b1 denotes the complex mass acquired by \u03a8\u03b1j . As for the neutrino-loop self-energy\npart, a similar relation should be set up for each eigenvalue of the mass matrix.\nFor the quark part, everything is analogous to the above.\nThus, the quadratic divergences caused by Yukawa interactions can be removed by the\nintroduction of the complex-ghost regulator fields without violating the unitarity of the\nphysical S-matrix, though Lorentz invariance is spontaneously violated slightly.\nReferences\n1) T.
