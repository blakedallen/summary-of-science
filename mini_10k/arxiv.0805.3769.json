In many cases, the diffusion law is altered\nin the way that the typical displacement of the random\nwalker still grows as a power of time, i.e. R(t) \u223c t\u03bd ,\nhowever, the diffusion exponent \u03bd differs from the value\n\u03bd = 1/2 characteristic of normal diffusion. In case of random walks with quenched random jump rates on regular\nlattices or random walks on fractal lattices (e.g. percolation clusters) the process is in general sub-diffusive,\ni.e. \u03bd < 1/2 [1, 2]. The opposite case, \u03bd > 1/2, where\nthe particle is speeded up compared to normal diffusion,\nis much rarer. This phenomenon, called superdiffusion,\narises e.g. in turbulent fluids [3], in chaotic transport\nin laminar fluid flows [4] or in systems of polymerlike\nbreakable micelles [5]. In random walk models, superdiffusion can be induced by allowing long-range jumps: In\nthe L\u00e9vy flight [2], jumps of arbitrary length are executed\nwith a probability that decays as a power of the length; in\nits \"discretized\" version, the Weierstrass walk, the possible jump lengths are integer powers of an integer a > 1\n[6].\nAnother possibility for superdiffusion in case of random\nwalks on a lattice is when long-range jumps occur only\nat certain sites of the lattice. In most cases, the underlying lattice is a union of a regular and a random graph,\nwhere the latter has arbitrarily long edges. Such graphs\nhave been investigated in various aspects. As a variant of\nthe small-world network model constructed by rewiring\nedges of a regular network [7], Newman and Watts have\nconsidered a one-dimensional lattice to which \"shortcuts\"\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: juhasz@szfki.hu\n\nbetween randomly chosen pairs of sites are added [8]. In\nthis model, shortest paths [8, 9], as well as spectral properties of the Laplacian [10] have been studied. Shortest paths or the diameter of d-dimensional lattices where\nlong edges exist between pairs of sites with probabilities that decay algebraically with the distance have been\nstudied by several authors for d = 1 [11, 12, 13, 14] and\nfor d \u2265 1 [15]. Beside the above models, n-regular graphs\nof this type, where the degree of all nodes (i.e. the number of edges emanating from a node) is n, have been introduced, as well. The issue of decentralized algorithms\nfor finding short paths has been considered by Kleinberg\nin a d-dimensional lattice where each site has a fixed\nnumber of directed edges to randomly chosen sites that\nare selected with power-law decaying probabilities [16].\nBenjamini and Hoffman have studied minimal paths in\n\u03c9-periodic graphs, which are unions of periodic graphs\nover the integers [17]. Recently, Boettcher et al. have introduced a hierarchical 3-regular network consisting of a\none-dimensional lattice and recursively constructed longrange links and calculated the random-walk dimension\ndrw \u2261 1/\u03bd of this network [18].\nIn this paper, we shall consider networks composed of\na one-dimensional lattice and an additional set of long\nlinks. Particularly, we focus on the intriguing situation\nwhen the tail of the distribution of edge-lengths is of the\nform P> (l) \u223c \u03b2l\u22121 . In this case, the diameter is conjectured to grow algebraically with the size of the network\nwith a non-universal \u03b2-dependent exponent [12, 15]. The\naim of this work is to confirm this conjecture by explicit\ncalculations and to probe whether the diffusion exponent\nin such networks displays a similar \"marginal\" behavior. For this purpose, we define a class of cubic (i.e.\n3-regular) networks with marginal edge-length distributions (i.e. P> (l) \u223c l\u22121 ) and shall constructively demonstrate that the shortest-path dimension that characterizes the size-dependence of the diameter and the diffusion\nexponent are not exclusively determined by the power in\nthe edge-length distribution but depend on the details of\n\n\f2\nthe structure of networks. The above two intrinsic properties of networks are calculated exactly in certain cases\nby means of a renormalization group method; in other\ncases, they are estimated by the numerical implementation of the renormalization procedure and by numerical\nsimulation.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section\nII, a class of networks parametrized by a positive integer\nk is defined and its general features are discussed. In\nSection III, networks with k = 1 whereas in Section IV,\nnetworks with k > 2 are investigated in detail. Results\nare discussed in Section V and a heuristic derivation of\nthe relation to resistor networks is presented in the Appendix.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nGENERAL FEATURES\n\nConstruction of the networks\n\nThe networks to be studied in the subsequent sections\nhave in common that they are all constructed in the following way. A one-dimensional open or periodic lattice\nwith N sites is given, where sites are numbered consecutively from 1 to N . The degree of all sites is thus initially\n2 in the periodic lattice and all but site 1 and N in the\nopen one. Sites of degree 2 will be called in brief active sites. The links of this initial regular lattice will be\ntermed short links in the followings in order to distinguish them from long links generated by the following\nprocedure. Let us assume that N is even and k is a fixed\npositive integer. A pair of active sites is selected such\nthat the number of active sites between them is k \u2212 1\nand this pair is then connected by a (long) link. That\nmeans, for k = 1, neighboring active sites are connected,\nfor k = 2 next-to-neighboring ones, etc. This step, which\nrenders two active sites to sites of degree 3, is then iterated until 2(k \u2212 1) active sites are left. These are then\npaired in an arbitrary way, which does not affect the exponents appearing in asymptotic relations in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e. In the resulting network, all sites are of degree\n3 if the procedure starts from a periodic lattice whereas,\nin case of an open lattice, site 1 and site N remain of\ndegree 1. The networks generated in this way (or, more\nprecisely, the ensembles of networks in case of random\nnetworks) are characterized by the number k and by the\nway pairs are selected.\nAt some stage of the construction procedure, when the\nnumber of active sites is Na , these sites are distributed\nhomogeneously on a coarse-grained scale \u03be \u226b 1/c, where\nc \u2261 Na /N is their number density. In other words, spacings between neighboring active sites have a rapidly decaying distribution with the expected value 1/c. Thus,\nlong links of length larger than l are generated typically\nwhen c is smaller than 1/l and we obtain for the distribution of lengths in an infinite network (N \u2192 \u221e):\nP> (l) \u223c l\u22121 . Disregarding regular networks (see Section\nIII B 1 and IV B), where exclusively long links of length\n\nln \u223c \u03bbn (\u03bb > 1, n = 1, 2, . . . ) form, the probability of a\nlong link of length l is thus inversely proportional to the\nsquare of the length: pl \u223c l\u22122 . Note, however, that not\nall edge lengths are realized in the construction procedure even for random networks. Namely, for k = 1, only\nlong links of odd length are produced.\nB.\n\nStudied quantities\n\nWe are interested in two intrinsic properties of networks. Beside the distance l measured on the underlying\none-dimensional lattice, we also consider another metric: The chemical distance (or the length of the shortest\npath) l between two sites is the minimum number of\nlinks that have to be traversed when going from one site\nto the other. We will see that, in the networks under\nstudy, the average length of shortest path between sites\nlocated in a distance l grows algebraically with l for large\ndistances: l(l) \u223c ldmin , where the shortest-path dimension dmin < 1 is characteristic of the particular network.\nThis dimension describes at the same time the finitesize scaling of the diameter D(N ) of a network, which is\nthe maximum of chemical distances between any pairs of\nsites: D(N ) \u223c N dmin .\nThe other quantity of interest is the random-walk dimension of the network [1, 19]. We consider a continuous time random walk on (infinite) networks, where the\nwalker can jump with unit rate to any of the sites connected with the site it resides. The random-walk dimension drw is defined through the relation [hx2 (t)i]typ \u223c\nt2/drw , where x(t) denotes the displacement of the walker\n(measured on the underlying one-dimensional lattice) at\ntime t and [hx2 (t)i]typ \u2261 exp lnhx2 (t)i is the \"typical\nvalue\" of hx2 (t)i. Here, h*i denotes the expected value\nfor a fixed starting position in a fixed realization of the\nensemble of networks, while the overbar stands for the\naverage over starting positions and the ensemble of networks. Note that the expected value hx2 (t)i does not\nexist if t > 0 since the expected value of edge lengths is\ninfinite (in infinite networks). This accounts for that the\naverage of lnhx2 (t)i is considered instead. The practical\nreason of the second averaging procedure is to eliminate\nrandom modulations which stem from the randomness of\nthe structure of networks, whereas for regular networks,\nthis averaging may be ignored.\nC.\n\nRelation to resistor networks\n\nThe calculation of random-walk dimension is based on\nthe well-known relation between the effective diffusion\nconstant and the effective resistance of the equivalent resistor network [1, 2]. In the equivalent resistor network,\neach link has a (dimensionless) resistance ri related to\nthe jump rate wi along that link via ri = 1/wi . Considering networks built on an open lattice, the time t needed\nfor the walker to get from one end of the network (site\n\n\f3\n1) to the other one (site N ) is\nt \u223c N r\u0303\n\n(1)\n\nfor large N , where r\u0303 is the effective resistance of the\nequivalent resistor network between the two endpoints.\nFor the sake of self-containedness, a heuristic derivation\nof this relation is given in the Appendix; for a precise\nformulation of this connection in an arbitrary network,\nthe reader is referred to Ref. [20]. Eq. (1) implies that\nthe random-walk dimension is related to the resistance\nexponent \u03b6 defined by the asymptotical relation r\u0303(N ) \u223c\nN \u03b6 as\ndrw = 1 + \u03b6.\n\n(2)\n\nSo, the problem of calculating drw is reduced to the calculation of the resistance exponent \u03b6 of the equivalent\nresistor network.\nNETWORKS WITH k = 1\n\nIII.\n\nThe simplest class of networks is obtained when neighboring active sites are connected in the construction procedure, i.e. k = 1. In this case, the elementary step of the\ncalculation of the resistance exponent is that a minimal\nloop (pair of sites with a short and a long link between\nthem) is eliminated as shown in Fig. 1, and the two sites\nnext to the removed pair are connected by a single link\nwith an effective resistance r\u0303. Applying the reduction\n1\na\n\nra\n\nb\n\nrb\n\nc\n\nrc\n\nd\n\na\n\n~\nr\n\nd\n\nFIG. 1: Replacement of a minimal loop by a single link.\n\nrules of resistors in series and in parallel, we obtain\nr\u0303 = ra + rc +\n\nrb\n.\nrb + 1\n\n(3)\n\nLet us denote the chemical distance between site i and\ni + 1 by li . Initially, li = 1 for all i and when the elimination step described above is carried out, the chemical\ndistance transforms in a simple way:\nl\u0303 = la + lc + 1.\n\n(4)\n\nNow, a renormalization group scheme can be defined,\nin which minimal loops are eliminated one after the other\nas described above, exactly in the same order as the long\nlinks of loops were created in the construction procedure.\nAs a consequence, the construction procedure and the\nrenormalization can be performed simultaneously: once a\npair of neighboring active sites is selected for getting connected it is immediately eliminated and replaced by an\neffective short link with resistance and chemical distance\ncalculated according to Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively.\nLet us start the construction-renormalization procedure\n\nwith an infinite one-dimensional lattice (N \u2192 \u221e) and\nassume that the length scale \u03be, which is the inverse of\nthe number density c of active sites, is large, i.e. \u03be \u226b 1.\nThen the typical resistance and chemical distance on effective short links scale with the length as r(\u03be) \u223c \u03be \u03b6 and\nl(\u03be) \u223c \u03be dmin , respectively. For large \u03be, the effective resistances and chemical distances are also large and the\ntransformation rules read asymptotically as r\u0303 \u2243 ra + rc\nand l\u0303 \u2243 la + lc , where the relation f \u2243 g is meant as\nlim\u03be\u2192\u221e f /g = 1. As the transformation rules of r and l\nare asymptotically identical, we conclude that for k = 1\n\u03b6 = dmin .\n\n(k = 1)\n\n(5)\n\nThus for k = 1, both drw and dmin are determined by the\nresistance exponent \u03b6. This exponent also has a further\ngeometrical meaning for k = 1. Let us consider a network\nbuilt on an open lattice and call a short link backbone\nlink if its removal results in that the network becomes\ndisconnected. Taking into account that shortest paths do\nnot contain turnbacks (at least in the interior of the path)\nand they are composed of long links and backbone links\nalternately, one can see that the fraction of backbone\nlinks in a network of size N is proportional to N dmin for\nlarge N . In other words, the set of backbone links is\na fractal object characterized by the fractal dimension\ndmin .\nA.\n\nUniform model\n\nPerhaps the simplest model in the class k = 1 is obtained when pairs of neighboring active sites are selected\nequiprobably in the course of the construction procedure.\nWe call this model the (k = 1) uniform model.\nThe resistance exponent of this network can be calculated as follows. Consider an infinite system (N \u2192 \u221e)\nand assume that, at some stadium of the renormalization\nprocedure, the number density of active sites is changed\nby an infinitesimal amount dc < 0. The differential of the\n\"resistance density\" \u03c1 \u2261 rc is then d\u03c1 = cdr+rdc. On the\nother hand, d\u03c1 \u2243 rdc/2, where the factor 1/2 comes from\nthat in an elimination step two sites are deleted but the\ntotal sum of resistances is reduced only by r on average.\nCombining these equations, we obtain cdr \u2243 \u2212rdc/2, the\nintegration of which results in the asymptotical relation\nr \u223c c\u22121/2 = \u03be 1/2 .\n\n(6)\n\nThus, in the k = 1 uniform model, the dimensions under\nstudy are \u03b6 = dmin = 1/2 and drw = 3/2. As can be seen,\nrandom walk is super-diffusive in this network.\nWe mention that the calculation carried out above remains valid also in the general case when the jump rates\nare random variables provided the expected value of the\ninverse jump rates (i.e. resistances) exists. Thus we obtain the same random-walk dimension for such a disordered model, which shows that drw is determined solely\nby the structure of the network.\n\n\f4\nB.\n\nClosest-neighbor networks\n\nAnother possibility to create networks with k = 1 is\nwhen pairs are not selected with a uniform probability but always the pair (or pairs) of actually closest active sites are connected. These networks will be termed\nclosest-neighbor networks. Here, distances between adjacent sites are rendered initially unequal; they are either\nrandom or are modulated according to some aperiodic sequence. Note that a periodic arrangement of short links\nof different lengths either would not produce arbitrarily\nlong links or would result in equal distances between active sites at some stadium of the construction procedure,\nafter which the procedure would no longer be unambiguous.\n\n1.\n\nAperiodic networks\n\nFirst, we consider networks where the short links of\ndifferent lengths are arranged according to aperiodic sequences. These aperiodic sequences are composed of letters taken from a finite alphabet {a, b, c, . . . } and are generated by the repeated application of an inflation rule,\nwhich assigns a word (i.e. a finite sequence of letters)\nto each letter. For instance, the simplest sequence that\nis suitable for our purposes is the so-called silver-mean\nsequence. It is composed of two different letters, a and\nb, and is generated by the inflation rule a \u2192 wa = aba,\nb \u2192 wb = a. Starting from letter a, the first few iterations are a,aba,abaaaba,abaaabaabaabaaaba, etc. To\nthese finite strings of letters, finite open lattices can be\nassociated in which the two different edge lengths la and\nlb (< la ) between adjacent sites follow the same sequence\nas the letters in the strings. In networks constructed\nin this way, there are multitudes of long links of equal\nlength. These long links will be termed links of the same\ngeneration. In general, the aperiodic sequences that we\nneed have to meet the following requirements. First, in\norder to avoid ambiguities in the construction procedure,\nadjacent short links of shortest length must not emerge.\nSecond, the infinite system must be self-similar. That\nmeans when a new generation of long links is formed, the\nsequence of new distances has to follow the original aperiodic sequence. Third, the order of distances must remain\ninvariant when a new generation of links is formed, i.e.\nif la > lb holds, the new distances must satisfy  \u0303la >  \u0303lb .\nIf these requirements are fulfilled, a renormalization step\nin which a complete generation of minimal loops is eliminated corresponds to a reversed inflation step. After\nthe sporadic inventions of such sequences in the field of\naperiodic quantum spin chains [21], an infinite class was\nintroduced with the purpose of studying entanglement\nentropy in those systems [22]. In the inflation rule of\nthese sequences, the words are composed of an odd number of letters and letter b, which will represent shortest\nlinks by convention, stands at even places. The inflation\nrule of two-letter sequences with the above properties can\n\nbe written in the general form\n\u001a\na \u2192 wa = aba(ba)m\u22121\n\u03c3mn :\nb \u2192 wb = a(ba)n\u22121 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere n and m are integers fulfilling 1 \u2264 n \u2264 m.\nThe special case m = n = 1 corresponds to the silvermean sequence mentioned above while, with the choice\nm = n = 2, the well-known Fibonacci sequence is generated. An example of three-letter sequences is the tripling\nsequence, generated by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 a \u2192 wa = aba\nb \u2192 wb = cbc\n\u03c3t :\n(8)\n\uf8f3 c \u2192 w = abc.\nc\nHere, edge lengths are ordered as lb < lc < la . The\nstructure of a few aperiodic closest-neighbor networks is\nillustrated in Fig. 2.\n\na b a a a b a a b a a b a a a b a\n\na b a b a a b a a b a b a\n\na b a c b c a b a a b c c b c a b c a b a c b c a b a\n\nFIG. 2: Fragments of the silver-mean, the Fibonacci and the\ntripling network (from top to bottom).\n\nWe shall show that the shortest-path dimension can be\ncalculated exactly from the substitution matrix S of the\nunderlying sequence. The elements S\u03b1\u03b2 of this matrix\nare given by S\u03b1\u03b2 = n\u03b1 (w\u03b2 ), where n\u03b1 (w\u03b2 ) is the number\nof occurrences of letter \u03b1 in the word w\u03b2 . Considering a string of letters si and a column vector v(si ) with\nthe components [v(si )]\u03b1 = n\u03b1 (si ), it is easy to see that\nthe application of the inflation transformation results in\na longer string si+1 with the vector v(si+1 ) = Sv(si ).\nThus, the asymptotic ratio of lengths of successive strings\nobtained in the inflation procedure is given by the largest\neigenvalue \u03bb+ of S. Besides, we need the asymptotical\nscaling of chemical distances between neighboring active\nsites when a new generation of links forms. The chemical distance l\u0303\u03b1 on an effective short link represented by\nletter \u03b1 after a new generation of long links has formed\nis related to the previous chemical distances l\u03b1 (\u03b1 6= b)\nas\nX\nl\u0303\u03b1 =\nn\u03b3 (w\u03b1 )l\u03b3 + nb (w\u03b1 ).\n(9)\n\u03b36=b\n\nIf the density of active sites is small, the chemical distances are also large and the last term on the r.h.s. of\nEq. (9) is negligible. We have thus the asymptotical relaP\ntion l\u0303\u03b1 \u2243 \u03b36=b n\u03b3 (w\u03b1 )l\u03b3 . This yields that the chemical\n\n\f5\ndistances grow in a renormalization step asymptotically\nby a factor \u03bb+ , i.e. l\u0303\u03b1 /l\u03b1 \u2243 \u03bb+ , \u03b1 6= b, where \u03bb+ is the\nlargest eigenvalue of the matrix S obtained from S by\ndeleting the row and column related to letter b. As the\nlength scale \u03be grows by the factor \u03bb+ in a renormalization\nstep, we obtain finally that the shortest-path dimension\n\u03bb+\nis given by dmin = ln\nln \u03bb+ and the random-walk dimension\nis\ndrw = 1 +\n\nln \u03bb+\n.\nln \u03bb+\n\n(10)\n\nFor the family of networks constructed by using\nsequences, we havei \u03bb+ (m, n) =\nh two-letter\np\n1\n(m + n)2 + 4(m \u2212 n + 1) and \u03bb+ (m, n) =\n2 m+n+\nm + 1. For example, for the silver-mean network we\nln 2\u221a\n, for the Fibonacci network\nobtain drw = 1 + ln(1+\n2)\n\u221a\n\ndrw = 1 + 3lnln3\u03c6 with the golden ratio \u03c6 = 1+2 5 . In the\ntripling network constructed by using the rule in Eq. (8),\nthe set of backbone links is closely related to the Cantor set and accordingly, the random-walk dimension is\nln 2\ndrw = 1 + ln\n3 . Numerical values of drw are shown in\nTable I for a few two-letter networks. It follows from Eq.\nm=n=1 (silver mean)\nm=n=2 (Fibonacci)\nm=n=3\nm=n=4\nm=n=5\n\n1.7864...\n1.7610...\n1.7623...\n1.7683...\n1.7748...\n\nTABLE I: Random-walk dimension of networks constructed\non the basis of the two-letter inflation rule in Eq. (7).\n\n(10) that 1 < drw < 2 for the aperiodic networks introduced in this section. This means that random walk is\nsuper-diffusive in these networks just as in the uniform\nmodel. Next, we discuss the bounds of drw in this class\nof networks. As can be seen from the data in Table I, for\nthe two-letter networks with n = m, the random-walk\ndimension increases monotonously with m (i.e. with the\nlength of words) after the minimum at m = 2 and one\ncan see from Eq. (10) that it tends to 2 in the limit\nm = n \u2192 \u221e. This tendency is intuitively easy to understand: A fragment of these networks which corresponds\nto a single word has periodically arranged short links,\nwhere the links of shortest length lb are located at even\nplaces. Therefore, the long links generated in the interior\nof such a fragment are of limited length (lb ) and, as a consequence, diffusion in such fragments is normal. Thus the\nupper bound of drw in this family of networks is drw = 2\nand this value, which is characteristic of normal diffusion, can be approached arbitrarily closely by choosing\nsufficiently long words in the inflation rule. Concerning\nthe lower bound of drw , presumably there does not exist\nrepresentatives of the family of k = 1 aperiodic networks\nwhich approach the ballistic limit drw = 1 arbitrarily\n\nclosely. In fact, the smallest value of drw that we found\n2\nis drw = 1+ ln\nln 3 \u2248 1.6309, which is realized in the tripling\nnetwork. The geometry of this network is known to be\nextremal also with respect to the von Neumann entropy\nof aperiodic quantum spin chains [22]. In section IV, we\nshall see that larger k may result in smaller random-walk\ndimensions.\n\n2.\n\nRandom closest-neighbor network and related networks\n\nAnother example for closest-neighbor networks is the\none generated with random initial lengths. In the case\nwhen the initial distribution of lengths is discrete and\nthere may be adjacent short links of shortest length\npresent with finite probability, the construction procedure is extended with the additional rule that a pair is\nrandomly selected from those with shortest distance with\nuniform probability.\nThe renormalization group scheme of this network with\nthe asymptotical rule l\u0303 \u2243 la + lc is formally identical\nto that arising in the context of a model of coarsening\nintroduced in Ref. [23]. For that recursion scheme, it\nhas been shown that the exponent z that appears in the\nrelation l(\u03be) \u223c \u03be z between the variable l and the length\nscale \u03be is the zero of a transcendental equation and it\nhas been found that z = 0.82492412 * * * . Thus for the\nrandom closest-neighbor network, we have dmin = z and\ndrw = 1 + z.\nNext, we discuss a variant of the random-closest neighbor network, the renormalization of which is identical to\nthat of certain quantum spin chains [24] and due to this\nequivalence, the random-walk dimension can be exactly\ndetermined again. Let us consider a one-dimensional lattice of size N with three variables at each short link:\nthe length ln , the chemical distance ln , both are initially\nequal to 1, and an independent, identically distributed\nrandom variable \u03b2n that we call \u03b2-distance. Now, a cubic network is generated as follows. The pair of active\nsites with the shortest \u03b2-distance, say \u03b2b , is chosen and\nthe two sites are connected by a long link. The length\nand the chemical distance on the new effective short link\nproduced in the equivalent renormalization step are calculated ordinarily but the \u03b2-distance has an anomalous\ntransformation rule:\n\u03b2\u0303 = \u03b2a + \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2b ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the indices refer to links as given in Fig. 1. As\nthe structure of the network constructed in this way is\nidentical to that of singlet bonds in the so-called randomsinglet phase of antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains,\nwe call this network random-singlet network. In Ref. [24],\nit was shown in the limit N \u2192 \u221e that, when the density\nc of active sites goes to zero, the typical value of the\nvariable l scales with the length\n\u03be = 1/c asymptotically\n\u221a\nas l(\u03be) \u223c \u03be \u03c6/2 , where \u03c6 = 1+2 5 is the golden ratio. The\nshortest-path dimension of the random-singlet network\n\n\f6\n\u221a\n\nis thus dmin = 1+4 5 \u2248 0.8090, and the random-walk\n\u221a\ndimension is drw = 5+4 5 .\nFinally, we examine another variant of the random\nclosest-neighbor network: This is constructed by connecting pairs of active sites with the actually shortest\nchemical distance. This means physically that when\nsearching the closest neighbor of an active site, the already existing long links are also made use of. When\ngenerating this network, which we call random minimalchemical-distance network, the initial chemical distances\nare made random; in the numerical calculations, we used\nthe initial values ln = 1 + \u01ebn , where \u01ebn \u226a 1 is a small\nrandom variable. One can easily see that the variables\nln and ln become positively correlated in the renormalization process of this network, i.e. for small values of ln\nthe variable ln is also typically small. On the grounds of\nthis observation, we expect that the shortest-path dimension of the random minimal-chemical-distance network is\nclose to that of the random closest-neighbor network. According to results of numerical calculations, this is indeed\nthe case. We have calculated the effective resistance between endpoints of networks generated from open lattices\nof size N = 2n , n = 4, . . . , 14. Data obtained in this way\nin 106 \u2212 107 independently generated networks were averaged for each N . Results are shown in Fig. 3. The\nmethod was tested on the uniform model, on the random\nclosest-neighbor network and on the random-singlet network, for which we obtained \u03b6 = 0.500(1), \u03b6 = 0.825(1)\nand \u03b6 = 0.809(1), respectively. The resistance exponent of the random minimal-chemical-distance network\nobtained in this way is \u03b6 = 0.826(1), which is very close\nto that of the random closest-neighbor network.\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nln[r(N)]\n\n\u03b6(N)\n\n||\n\n2\n4\n\nln(N)\n\nNETWORKS WITH k > 1\n\nIn this section, we will discuss networks with k > 1,\nwhich differ from the class of networks with k = 1 studied\nso far in that the resistance exponent and the shortestpath dimension are no longer equal. We will focus mainly\non the case k = 2, where a renormalization group scheme\nsimilar to that applied for k = 1 can be formulated.\nHerein, the minimal loops, which are triangles for k = 2,\nare eliminated one after the other as shown in Fig. 4.

In addition to the averaging over starting positions, data obtained in 500 independent networks were\naveraged. Results are shown in Fig. 6. The estimated\nrandom-walk dimensions are drw (k = 1) = 1.49(1),\ndrw (k = 2) = 1.31(1) and drw (k = 3) = 1.19(1). As can\nbe seen, these values are less accurate compared to the\nresistance exponent calculated by numerical renormalization. Nevertheless, drw (k = 1) measured in this way is\ncompatible with the exact value 3/2 and drw (k = 2) is\ncompatible with \u03b6 calculated numerically for k = 2.\n\nln(|x(t)|)\n\nAs can be seen, the average value of \u2206 cannot be expressed by the average values of resistances rb ,rc and rf ,\ntherefore the evolution of the entire distribution of the\nlatter quantities should be taken into consideration. Another difficulty is that the renormalization rules in Eq.\n(12) apparently induce correlations between the quantities r\u0303a , r\u0303c and r\u0303g . Therefore, we resorted here to numerical methods again in order to estimate drw and dmin .\nAccording to results of numerical renormalization, the\nabsolute value of the average of the last term on the r.h.s.\nof Eq. (13) is growing proportionally to the average of\neffective resistances in the course of the procedure. Although, it is thus not negligible compared to the average\nof first two terms on the r.h.s. of Eq. (13), it is by\nan order of magnitude smaller than those two terms. If\nthe last term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (13) is omitted, the\nresulting simple renormalization process that is analytically tractable may provide a first approximation for the\nresistance exponent. Using that the average resistance of\nshort links is equal to that of long links, which follows\nafter all from the symmetry of the transformation rules\nin Eq. (12), we can write for the differential of the resistance density in this simplified process: d\u03c1 = 2rdc/3,\nwhich leads finally to r(\u03be) \u223c \u03be 1/3 .\nWe have carried out the renormalization procedure\nnumerically until two active sites were left in networks\ngenerated from periodic chains of size N = 2n , n =\n4, . . . , 15. The average resistance of the remaining two\neffective short links was calculated from data obtained in\n107 \u2212 6 \u00d7 106 independent networks for each system size\nN .

As we measured\n\nBeside the random-walk dimension, we have measured\nthe shortest-path dimension for k = 1, 2, 3, as well. The\nlength of shortest-path between sites in a distance N/2\nwas determined by a simple breadth-first search algorithm. This was performed in 5 \u00d7 105 \u2212 5 \u00d7 103 independently generated networks for each size N = 2n ,\nn = 4, . . . , 17, and for N/8 pairs of sites in each network.\nThe average chemical distance l(N ), plotted against N\nin Fig. 7, was found to grow for large N as l(N ) \u223c\nN dmin + C with a constant term C \u2248 \u22122, that shifts the\neffective dmin (N ) considerably for moderate N . Using\nthis ansatz, the estimated shortest-path dimensions are:\ndmin (k = 1) = 0.500(1), dmin (k = 2) = 0.440(1) and\ndmin (k = 3) = 0.381(1).\n\n\f8\n1.\n0.6\n\nFirst, we examine the k = 2 tripling network which\nis constructed by means of the tripling sequence with\nthe inflation rule in Eq.

Horizontal lines indicate the\nextrapolated values in the limit N \u2192 \u221e.\n\nB.\n\nRegular networks\n\nIn addition to the random networks studied in the previous section, one can define regular networks with k > 1,\nas well. The cubic, hierarchical network studied in Ref.\n[18] is an example for a regular network with k = 2.\nIn this section, we shall consider regular k = 2 networks\nwhich are defined by means of aperiodic sequences. Here,\nthe random-walk dimension and the shortest-path dimension can be calculated exactly.\nLet us consider the subclass of aperiodic sequences discussed in section III B 1, where the length of words is\neither one or three. One can define networks by using\ninflation rules with longer words, as well, but we shall focus on this simple subclass. Once a sequence of this class\nis given, a finite network with odd sites can be defined as\nfollows. A finite string of letters which is generated from\na single letter is taken and this time, not the links but\nthe sites of a one-dimensional lattice are labeled with the\nletters of the string. The sites are grouped into blocks\ncorresponding to words w\u03b1 in the inflation rule, which\ncan be done unambiguously. Then, sites belonging to\none-letter blocks are renamed according to the reversed\ninflation rule w\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1, where w\u03b1 is the one-letter word\ncorresponding to the block. In blocks composed of three\nsites, the two lateral sites are connected, and the middle\none is renamed again according to the reversed inflation\nrule w\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1, where w\u03b1 is the word corresponding to the\nblock. The above step is then iterated until only one active site is left. In finite networks this site is of degree\n2.\nWe have not found a general way of calculating drw\nand dmin in these networks so they have to be treated\nindividually. Two examples will be discussed.\n\nFIG. 8: A finite k = 2 tripling network (top) and a finite\nk = 2 silver-mean network (bottom).\n\napplying the inflation rule n-times on letter a and consider the corresponding sequence of finite networks built\non open lattices the sites of which are labeled by these\nstrings. The size of the nth such network is Nn = 3n .\nBy constructing the first few such networks and observing their self-similar structure, one can easily check that,\nfor the length of the shortest path between the two endpoints, the recursive relation ln = 2ln\u22121 + 1 holds. Thus\nfor large n, ln \u223c 2n . Expressing n with Nn yields\nl \u223c N ln 2/ ln 3 . The shortest-path dimension of this netln 2\nwork is thus dmin = ln\n3 \u2248 0.6309.\nThe resistance exponent of this network can be calculated by a renormalization procedure in which the generation of long links belonging to minimal loops is iteratively eliminated according to the scheme shown in Fig.\n4. Let us consider the infinite network (N \u2192 \u221e), with\nresistance r on short links and resistance p on long links.\nWhen the generation of long links belonging to minimal\nloops is eliminated, we obtain a similar network but with\nmodified parameters r\u0303 and p\u0303. Using Eq.

Keeping in mind that the scaling\nfactor of the length is \u03bb = 3, we obtain for the resistance\nln 5/3\nln \u03bb\nexponent: \u03b6 = ln\n\u03bb = ln 3 and for the random-walk\n5\ndimension: drw = 1 + \u03b6 = ln\nln 3 \u2248 1.4650.\n2.\n\nThe k = 2 silver-mean network\n\nNext, we discuss the k = 2 silver-mean network constructed by using the inflation rule in Eq. (7) with\nm = n = 1 (see Fig. 8). Observing the self-similar structure of finite representatives of this network, one can formulate the following recursion equation for the lengths of\nshortest-paths between endpoints in finite networks constructed by consecutive strings of letters: lk = 3lk\u22122 + 2.\n\n\f9\nThe asymptotic\nscaling factor of the chemical distance is\n\u221a\nthus 3. As the asymptotic\nscaling factor of the size of\n\u221a\nthe network is 1 + 2 (see\u221a Sec. III B 1), the shortest-path\nln \u221a\n3\n\u2248 0.6232.\ndimension is dmin = ln(1+\n2)\nThe calculation of \u03b6 for the silver-mean network is\nsomewhat more involved than for the tripling network.\nIn order to find blocks which transform in a self-similar\nway under a renormalization step, an additional site of\ndegree 2 is inserted in the middle of each short link. The\nnumber of short links (and sites) is thus doubled but\nif we assign a resistance 1/2 to short links instead of 1\nin this extended network, the effective resistance is obviously equal to that of the original network. Furthermore,\ninstead of keeping track of resistances of long links, we divide the resistance of a long link equally among the two\nsites that it connects. This means formally that there\nis an additional variable pi at all sites of the original\nnetwork (initially 1/2), which changes in the course of\nthe renormalization procedure, just as the resistances of\nshort links. After eliminating the first generation of long\nlinks, the effective resistances of short links emanating\nfrom sites of type a will be different from those of short\nlinks emanating from sites of type b. These resistances\nwill be denoted by ra and rb , respectively. The additional variables will also be different at the two types of\nsites. These will be denoted by pa and pb . This structure\nof the parameters remains, however, invariant when the\nsubsequent generations of long links are eliminated. The\nsubstitution of the two different types of building blocks\nof the silver-mean network is illustrated in Fig. 9.

A model similar to random networks of\nthis class (although, not n-regular) is the model by Benjamini and Berger, where any pairs of sites in a distance l\nare connected with probability pl \u223c \u03b2l\u2212s\u22121 for large l. In\nthat model, the diameter D, which is measured in terms\nof chemical distances, was conjectured to grow with the\nsystem size as D(N ) \u223c N dmin (\u03b2) with some \u03b2-dependent\nexponent 0 < dmin (\u03b2) < 1 in the marginal case s = 1\n[12]. Later, a power-law lower bound for \u03b2 < 1 and a\npower-law upper bound for any \u03b2 were shown to exist\nasymptotically with high probability for the size dependence of the diameter [15]. Thus, as far as the length\nof shortest paths (or the diameter) is concerned, random\nnetworks studied in this paper behave as that model is\nconjectured to do. Furthermore, we have shown that beside dmin , the random-walk dimension is also influenced\nby the details of the structure of networks in the marginal\npoint s = 1 [25].\nBy means of the class of networks introduced in this\nwork, a different type of control of the diffusion exponent\ncan be realized compared to previous models. The control parameter is not the index s as in the L\u00e9vy flight,\nwhich is set to its marginal value s = 1 here, nor the\nprefactor \u03b2 as in the marginal Benjamini-Berger model\nbut the number k and other possible parameters appearing in the construction procedure. The prefactor \u03b2 in\nthe distribution of lengths, as well as the shortest-path\ndimension and the random-walk dimension of these networks are non-trivial functions of these parameters.\nWe have also shown that by a sequence of k = 1 aperiodic networks, the normal diffusion limit (drw = 2) can\nbe approached arbitrarily closely. According to numerical results for k = 1, 2, 3 uniform networks, the randomwalk dimension decreases with the parameter k and if\nk \u2192 \u221e, the latter quantity tends presumably to the ballistic limit drw = 1.\nAs opposed to the diffusion exponent that varies continuously with the index s in case of the L\u00e9vy flight, the\nset of possible values of drw which can be realized by\nthese networks is discrete. Nevertheless, one can define\nuniform networks where the parameter k is not fixed but\nmore than one values of k are used in the construction\nprocedure, e.g. k \u2208 {n, n + 1} with a fixed positive inte-\n\n\f10\nger n. The random-walk dimension of such \"mixed\" networks is expected to interpolate between that of \"pure\"\nones constructed with a single k.\nIn a sub-class of networks introduced in this paper, the\ndimensions dmin and drw have been calculated exactly; in\nsome cases they have been estimated by numerical methods. The possible exact calculation of these dimensions\nfor other networks of this class or finding rigorous bounds\non these quantities is the task of future research.\nAPPENDIX A\n\nLet us consider a network built on an open onedimensional lattice of size N . Connect the sites at the\nends of the lattice (site 1 and N ) with a directed link\nwhich the walker can traverse only in one direction, say\nfrom site 1 to site N with a unit rate. Let us denote the\nprobability that the random walker can be found at site i\nin the steady-state by \u03c0i . These probabilities satisfy the\nset of linear equations\nX\nwij (\u03c0i \u2212 \u03c0j ) = 0, 1 < i < N,\n(A1)\nj\n\nwhere the summation goes over the set of sites connected\nwith site i and wij denotes the jump rate from site i to\nsite j; in our case wN 1 = 0 and wij = 1 for other pairs\n(i, j) of connected sites. Now, one can notice that Eq.\n\n[1] S. Havlin and D. Ben-Avraham, Adv. Phys. 36, 695\n(1987).\n[2] J.P. Bouchaud and A. Georges, Phys. Rep. 195, 217\n(1990).\n[3] M.F. Shlesinger, B.J. West and J.

Namely, \u03c0i plays the role of the potential at site\ni and 1/wij corresponds to the resistance of link (i, j).\nConsequently, if the part of the network between site 1\nand N (except of the directed link) is replaced with a\nsingle (symmetric) link with a jump rate 1/r\u0303, where r\u0303 is\nthe effective resistance of the equivalent resistor network,\nthe steady-state current J through the directed link remains unchanged. On the other hand, we may write for\nJ in this simplified \"circuit\", which consists of site 1 and\nsite N , as well as the directed link and the effective symmetric link connecting them:\nJ = \u03c01 = (\u03c0N \u2212 \u03c01 )r\u0303\u22121 .\n\n(A2)\n\nIf N \u226b 1, the effective resistance is also large and we\nhave J = \u03c01 \u2248 \u03c0N r\u0303\u22121 . If all the links were symmetric,\nthe walker would be distributed uniformly on the network\nin the steady state. Although the link between site 1 and\nsite N is directed and this leads to that the network is\ndepleted on the side containing site 1, the steady-state\nprobabilities far from the end 1 such as \u03c0N are still proportional to 1/N for large N . The expected value of the\ntime t that the walker needs to make a complete tour on\nthe network (from site N to the same site through the\ndirected link) is related to the current as t = 1/J. Thus,\n\u22121\nr\u0303 \u223c N 1+\u03b6\nit scales with the size of the network as t \u2248 \u03c0N\nin the large N limit, from which we arrive at Eq. (2).\n\n[14] C.F. Moukarzel and M.
