He asserted that in different countries and times the\ndistribution of income and wealth follows a power law behaviour, i.e. the cumulative probability P (w) of agents whose\nincome is at least w is given by P (w) \u221d w\u2212\u03b11 . Today, this power law distribution is known as Pareto distribution,\nand the exponent \u03b1 is named Pareto index. However, recent data indicates that, even though Pareto's distribution\nprovides a good fit to the distribution of high range of income, it does not agree with observed data over the middle\nand low range of income. For instance, data from Japan2,3 , Italy4 , India5 , the United States of America and the\nUnited Kingdom6,7,8 are fitted by a log-normal or Gibbs distribution with a maximum in middle range plus a power\nlaw for the high income strata. The existence of these two regimes may be justified in a qualitative way by stating\nthat in the low and middle income class the process of accumulation of wealth is additive, causing a Gaussian-like\ndistribution, while in the high income class the wealth grows in a multiplicative way, generating the power law tail3 .\nDifferent models of capital exchange among economic agents have been proposed trying to explain these empirical\ndata. Most of these models consider an ensemble of interacting economic agents that exchange a fixed or random\namount of a quantity called \"wealth\". The wealth represents the welfare of the agents. The exact choice of this\nquantity is not straightforward. For instance, in the model of Dragulescu and Yakovenko6 the wealth is associated\nwith the amount of money a person has available to exchange. Within this model the amount of money corresponds\nto a kind of economic \"energy\" that may be exchanged by the agents in a random way and the resulting wealth\ndistribution is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 a Gibbs exponential distribution. An exponential distribution but as a function of\nthe square of the wealth is obtained in a model with extremal dynamics where some action is taken, at each time\nstep, to change the wealth of the poorest agent, trying to improve its economic state9 . In the case of this last model\na poverty line with finite wealth is also obtained, describing a way to diminish inequality in real societies10 .\nAiming to obtain distributions with power law tails, several methods have been proposed. Keeping the constraint\nof wealth conservation a detailed studied proposition is that each agent saves a fraction \u2013constant or random\u2013 of their\nresources12,13,14,15,16,17,18 , Numerical results, as well as recent analytical calculations11 , indicate that one possible\nresult of that model is condensation, i.e. concentration of all available wealth in just one or a few agents. To overcome\nthis situation, different rules of interaction have been applied, for example increasing the probability of favoring the\npoorer agent in a transaction 17,18 . However, to our knowledge, there are few detailed studies comparing the effect of\nthese two parameters, the risk-aversion parameter and the probability of favoring the poorer agent11 . Besides, most\nof the previous works do not consider the time evolution of the system, moreover many of them do not guarantee that\na steady state was attained indeed.\nWe present here a systematic study of an agent based model where exchanges are made by pairs of agents chosen at\nrandom, so it is model with no underlying lattice. Each agent, i, is characterized by a wealth, wi and a risk-aversion\nfactor \u03b2i , while in the exchange there is a probability of favoring the poorer partner given by17,18 :\np=\n\n1\n|wi (t) \u2212 wj (t)|\n+f \u00d7\n,\n2\nwi (t) + wj (t)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f is a factor going from 0 (equal probability for both agents) to 1/2 (highest probability of favoring the poorer\n\n\f2\nagent). Thus, in each interaction the poorer agent has probability p of earn a quantity dw, whereas the richer one\nhas probability 1 \u2212 p. We focus on the choice of the quantity dw transferred from the loser to the winner. In most of\nthe previous work17 a kind of fair lottery is used: the amount of money exchanged correspond to the minimum stake\namong the partners: dw = min[(1 \u2212 \u03b2i )wi (t); (1 \u2212 \u03b2j )wj (t)], so it is the same amount for both agents. However this\nequal opportunity rule produces an evil after-effect: in the f = 0 case, \"condensation\" occurs: all available wealth\ngoes to one (or very few) agent, i.e. the Gini coefficient converges to 1. Also, for f 6= 0, even if the poorer partner\nhas bigger chances of winning, its gains are as negligible as its own capital, so chances of improving are very low19 .\nFor this reason we also investigate an alternative rule, where dw is just the amount risked by the loser \u2013 (1 \u2212 \u03b2j )wj (t)\n\u2013 being j the loser agent. We call this rule loser rule. Actually, variations of this loser rule have been used in some\nof the papers quoted above6,12,13,14,15 , but there is no a good reason why a rich agent will risk more than its poorer\npartner. Possible examples are marriage followed by divorce, the parties do combine their holdings and later divide\nthem, or, in the corporate world, mergers followed by spin-offs19 .\nIn what follows we compare the results between the two rules in terms of the following quantities that we define\nthereafter: wealth distribution H(w), Gini index vs. time, and wealth temporal correlation function. The wealth\ndistribution is probably the most important quantity for the global description of a economic system. H(w) vs. dw\ngives the fraction of the population that have wealth between w and w + dw. However, this distribution is obtained\nat a given time, both in real situations as well as in simulations, and in the case of simulations it is important to\nknow weather the results are stable or not. With this purpose we measure the Gini coefficient as a function of time.\nIt represents a practical way to verify the time dependence of the economic parameters. Finally, we also present\nthe wealth temporal autocorrelation function. For one side this is another possible measure of time dependence in a\nsystem. Besides, it is more sensitive because it depends on two times, so aging properties, if there is any, could be\ngrasped.\nII.\n\nWEALTH DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nAll the simulations have been performed for a system of 1000 agents and the results have been averaged over\n1000 samples. Wealth distributions are evaluated at the final stage, while at the initial condition, both wealth (wi )\nand risk-aversion factor (\u03b2i ) are uniformly distributed in the [0, 1] interval. Final stage means not further -or very\nsmall- changes are observed as time goes by. Support for that assumption will be presented in the next section.\nAt first both rules seem to be qualitatively similar (one of them, the fair rule, was already discussed in ref.17 ).

The straight line with\nslope 2 corresponds to the slope of the f = 0.5 case, in the intermediate income region, for both rules.\n\nmain features of the wealth distributions emerging of the present model are: a) an almost uniform region for very\nlow incomes (w < 3 \u00d7 10\u22121 ), being more uniform as f is bigger, b) a power law region extended over less than three\ndecades with an f -dependent exponent. The distinctive feature is in the intermediate income region which appears\nless populated, at low f values, in the fair rule, when compared to the loser rule. The straight line depicted in both\ngraphs, with slope equal to two, is a guide to the eye, and it follows approximately the slope of the distributions in\nthe intermediate income region, with f = 0.5, for both rules. We would like to emphasize the f = 0 case, where both\ndistributions exhibit a power law, but the loser case has a bigger exponent (\u22122.17 compared to \u22121.93 for the fair\ncase) so indicating a less unequal distribution.\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nGINI COEFFICIENT\n\nThe Gini coefficient is a measure of the inequality of a distribution and is often used to measure income inequality\nby economists and statistical organizations because it gives a raw picture of the inequalities with a single number\nbetween 0 and 1. It is defined as the ratio of the area enclosed by the Lorenz curve of the distribution (or cumulative\ndistribution function) and the curve of the uniform distribution, to the area under the uniform distribution20 . In a\noperational way we define the Gini coefficient as:\nP\n1 i,j |wi \u2212 wj |\nP\n(2)\nG=\n2 N i wi\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\nGini index\n\nGini index\n\nand it is evident that it varies between 0, which corresponds to perfect equality (i.e. everyone has the same income),\nand 1, that corresponds to perfect inequality (i.e. one person has all the income, while everyone else has zero income).\nHere we will use the Gini coefficient to measure the degree of inequality, but also to determine the stability of the\nwealth distribution. With this objective in mind, we show in Fig. 2 the time evolution of the Gini index, where we\n\n0.6\nf = 0.50\nf = 0.40\nf = 0.30\nf = 0.20\nf = 0.10\nf = 0.00\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.6\nf = 0.50\nf = 0.40\nf = 0.30\nf = 0.20\nf = 0.10\nf = 0.00\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n2000\n\nMC steps\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nMC steps\n\nFIG. 2: Gini index as a function of time for different values of f , with fair (left) and loser (right) rule.\n\ncan observe that the systems converge rather fast to a fixed value, indicating that, after a transient, the systems\narrive to an almost stable wealth distribution. A further analysis (measuring the slope) reveals that in some cases\nstabilization is not complete, and that a slow dynamics is still present. This point is confirmed by the analysis of the\ntime correlation function presented in the next section. The effect of f on the Gini coefficient is the expected one, the\nbigger the value of f , the bigger the probability of favoring the poorer agent in each transaction, and the lower the\nGini index. However, the loser rule produces, for low values of f , a considerable lower Gini index than the fair rule,\nsuggesting that an unfair lottery produces a more equal society than a fair one. Particularly, for f = 0 the fair rule\ndelivers a Gini coefficient equal to 1 (full condensation of the economy), while the loser rule produces a finite Gini\ncoefficient near 0.8. This is a result that can induce some second thoughts about the concept of equal opportunity19 .\nWe summarize the comparison of the two rules depicting the Gini coefficient as a function of the f parameter.\nIn Fig. 3 we can see clearly that the Gini index decreases when increasing the parameter f , but the two rules give\nunequal results: the fair rule spans on a wider interval of Gini index values than the loser rule. The crossing of both\nlines at f = 0.3 confirms what was apparent in Fig. 1(a-b): for that value the same distribution emerges with both\nrules. In fact most of the previous analysis of wealth distribution can be see clearly here: while the fair rule gives a\nlittle bit more \"humanitarian\" distributions for high f values (more protective economies), the loser rule rescue more\nagents from the poorest region in the case of small values of f .\nIV.\n\nWEALTH TIME AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION\n\nWe define a time autocorrelation function for the wealth as follows:\nPN\ni=1 wi (\u03c4 )wi (\u03c4 + t)\ncorr(\u03c4, t) = P\nN\ni=1 wi (\u03c4 )wi (\u03c4 )\nThe behavior depicted by the time correlation functions is very rich, in a way that is not perceive neither by the\ndistribution or the Gini index. The behaviour in the rules are very disparate, but in both cases clearly signs of aging\n\n\f4\n\nFair rule\nLoser rule\n\n1\n\nGini index\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nf\n\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\nf = 0.50\nf = 0.30\nf = 0.10\nf = 0.00\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nMC steps\n\ncorr(100,t)\n\ncorr(100,t)\n\nFIG. 3: Gini index as a function of f , for the two rules: fair and loser.\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n1.9\n1.8\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\nf = 0.50\nf = 0.30\nf = 0.10\nf = 0.00\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nMC steps\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nFIG. 4: Wealth time autocorrelation function (defined in text) for \u03c4 = 100 MC steps and different values of the parameter f ,\nwith fair (left) and loser (right) rule.\n\nare observed (we checked this varying the initial time \u03c4 ). While in the fair case the time correlation decreases, in the\nloser case, after an initial and short decrease, the correlation function increases to values bigger than one. We remark\nthat in the fair case and for f = 0 the time correlation is stable and equal to 1, because the system condensates very\nfast and the changes in the wealth of the agents are very small. But when increasing the value of f the time correlation\nfunction decreases, suggesting a higher degree of social mobility as time evolves. On the other hand, for the loser rule\nthe time correlation exhibits slow dynamics (glassy behaviour, also observed for the fair rule in the case f = 0.1));\nthat means that the system requires a large time-period to attain an almost stable situation (as that represented in\nFig.1), and this characteristic time increases when increasing the size of the system, as expected. Another interesting\npoint is that, with the exception of f = 0.5, the value of the autocorrelation function is bigger than one, indicating\na kind of bias in the evolution: on average rich agents are becoming richer and poor agents poorer. This result,\ncombined with the conservation of the total wealth, explains the fact that the correlation function increases as time\ngoes by. A full discussion of these results, considering also different values of \u03c4 will be presented elsewhere.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur results clearly show that in many cases the system does not arrive to a steady configuration (a remarkable\nexception is the case f = 0.5, when the probability has its strongest bias to the poorer partner). This point is not\ndecisive for the description of economic systems as usually they are not in a steady state neither they are conservative,\nbut the implications could be interesting for possible physical systems that behaves in a similar glassy way.\nProbably the most relevant result is the fact that the loser rule appears to produce a less unequal wealth distributions\nthan the one we call fair rule. That is valid for values of the f < 0.3, which represent situations more close to real\neconomic systems. Thus, the loser rule behaves somehow like an unfair lottery, in the sense that the richer agent risks\nmore \u2013 in average \u2013 than its poorer partner, but has less chances to win. As a consequence, this bias attenuates the\ninequalities induced by low f values. It seems to us that this result is an indication that the best way to diminish\ninequality does not pass only through equal opportunity (fair rule) but through some kind of positive action increasing\n\n\f5\nthe odds of poorer strata of the society.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\nPareto V (1897), Cours d'Economie Politique, Vol. 2, F.
