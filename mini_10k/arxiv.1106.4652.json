The coefficient function controls NNLO contributions in resummed\ncalculations at full next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The same coefficient\nfunction is used in applications of the subtraction method to perform fully-exclusive\nperturbative calculations up to NNLO.\n\nJune 2011\n\u2217\n\nOn leave of absence from INFN, Sezione di Firenze, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy.\n\n\fThe transverse-momentum (qT ) distribution of systems with high invariant mass M (such\nas Drell\u2013Yan lepton pairs, photon pairs, vector bosons, Higgs bosons, and so forth) produced\nin hadron collisions is computable by using perturbative QCD. However, in the small-qT region\n(roughly, in the region where qT \u226a M) the convergence of the fixed-order perturbative expansion\nin powers of the QCD coupling \u03b1S is spoiled by the presence of large logarithmic contributions\nof the type lnn (M 2 /qT2 ). The predictivity of perturbative QCD can be recovered through the\nsummation of these logarithmically-enhanced contributions to all order in \u03b1S [1].\nThe structure of the resummed calculation can be organized in a process-independent form\n[2, 3, 4, 5], in which the logarithmic contributions are controlled by a set of perturbative functions,\nusually denoted as A(\u03b1S ), B(\u03b1S ), C(\u03b1S ) and H(\u03b1S ) (see, e.g., Eqs. (8) and (16) and related comments). These functions and, hence, their perturbative coefficients (e.g. the coefficient A(n) of the\nn-th order contribution A(n) \u03b1Sn to A(\u03b1S )), have no explicit dependence on the ratio qT /M. The\nperturbative coefficients, once they are known, can be inserted in process-independent resummation formulae that systematically resum, in explicit form, the classes of leading, next-to-leading,\nnext-to-next-to-leading (and so forth) logarithmic contributions to the transverse-momentum distribution. In this respect, the transverse-momentum resummation program has formal analogies\u2020\nwith the study of logarithmic scaling violations (of ultraviolet or collinear origin), where the resummation of logarithmic terms is traded for the calculation of perturbative functions, such as\nshort-distance coefficient functions and anomalous dimensions.\nMost of the qT resummation coefficients are known, since some time [6, 7, 8, 9], up to the second\norder in \u03b1S . The third-order coefficient A(3) has been obtained in Ref. [10]. In recent years, we\nhave been working on a research project aimed at the completion of the qT resummation program\nat the second perturbative order. This requires the calculation of the second-order coefficient\nfunction\u2021 H(2) (z) (see Eq. (19)), which includes a process-dependent part. The computation of\nthe H(2) coefficients has been explicitly carried out for two benchmark processes, namely, Higgs\nboson production and the Drell\u2013Yan process, and the corresponding results have been obtained\nand used in Refs. [11] and [12], respectively. In the case of the Drell\u2013Yan process, the result has\nalso been applied [13] to the qT spectrum of the Z boson, by explicitly performing transversemomentum resummation at the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. In this\npaper, we consider Higgs boson production and we document the result for H(2) [11] in explicit\nanalytic form. We also illustrate the method that we have used to perform the calculation.\nConsidering the perturbative contributions that are logarithmically-enhanced and, thus, singular in the limit qT \u2192 0, the calculation of H(2) completes the knowledge of the qT distribution\nat full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy. This fact has implications in the context\nof both resummed and fixed-order calculations, as we briefly discuss below.\nSome recent resummed calculations of the qT spectrum of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs\nboson at Tevatron and LHC energies are presented in Refs. [14]\u2013[21]. The inclusion of H(2) in\ncalculations that use the other qT resummation coefficients up to NNLL order gives theoretical\npredictions that embody the exact NNLO calculation in the small-qT region. The NNLL resummed\ncalculations can then be properly matched (by using, for instance, qT resummation as in the\n\u2020\n\nThese analogies may hide important physical, conceptual and technical differences, which are discussed in the\nliterature on transverse-momentum resummation.\n\u2021\nIn this introductory part we are using a shorthand notation, since the symbol H(2) actually refers to a set of\nseveral coefficient functions.\n\n1\n\n\fformalism of Ref. [19]) with the customary fixed-order calculation at large qT , in such a way that\nthe integration over qT of the qT distribution exactly returns the NNLO value of the total cross\nsection. Indeed, a rough approximation of H(2) , such as to reproduce the NNLO value of the\ntotal cross section with good numerical accuracy, was constructed and used in Ref. [19]. The\napproximation of Ref. [19] represents a very crude estimate of the function H(2) (z); nonetheless,\nthat approximation quantitatively works very well (especially at LHC energies) [19, 20] over a wide\nrange of Higgs boson masses. An updated version of the code HqT [19], which also implements the\nexact coefficient H(2) , is now available [22].\nIn Ref. [11], we presented a practical formalism to perform NNLO calculations at the fullyexclusive level for a specific class of processes, namely, the production of colourless high-mass\nsystems in hadron collisions. The formalism exploits the subtraction method to cancel the unphysical infrared divergences that separately occur in the real and virtual radiative corrections. The\nexplicit construction of the subtraction counterterms [19, 20] is based on the process-independent\nstructure of transverse-momentum resummation formulae and on their expansion up to NNLO in\nQCD perturbation theory. The formalism thus requires the complete knowledge of the qT resummation coefficients up to O(\u03b1S2 ). Although the results of the present paper were not explicitly\nillustrated in Ref. [11], they were taken into account in the NNLO computations presented therein.\nIn particular, the explicit application to Higgs boson production (which was implemented in the\nMonte Carlo code HNNLO) considered in Refs. [11, 23] is based on and implements the analytic\nresults for the coefficient function H(2) that are documented in the present paper.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We first introduce our notation and describe the smallqT behaviour of the Higgs boson cross section up to NNLO. Then we briefly review transversemomentum resummation for Higgs boson production and the corresponding all-order resummation\nformula recently derived in Ref. [5]. The new resummation formula differs from its na\u0131\u0308ve version\nthat is used in the literature: the differences start at O(\u03b1S2 ), which is relevant for the purposes\nof the present paper. Finally, we present the analytic results of our NNLO calculation of the qT\ndistribution. The results are expressed directly in terms of the coefficient function H(2) (z) and\nrelated resummation coefficients. We conclude the paper by describing the method that we have\nused to perform the NNLO calculation.\nWe briefly introduce the theoretical framework and our notation. We consider the production\nof the SM Higgs boson H, through the gluon fusion mechanism gg \u2192 H, in hadron\u2013hadron\ncollisions. The effective coupling ggH is produced by heavy-quark loops, and the top quark\ngives the dominant contribution. We treat the coupling ggH in the framework of the large-mtop\napproximation [24, 25, 26], and we consider a single heavy quark, the top quark with mass mtop ,\nand nF (nF = 5) massless-quark flavours. We use the narrow width approximation and we treat\nthe Higgs boson as an on-shell particle with mass M. The QCD expression of the Higgs boson\ntransverse-momentum cross section is\nZ 1\nXZ 1\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\u0302ab\ndz1\ndz2 fa/h1 (z1 , M 2 ) fb/h2 (z2 , M 2 )\n(qT , M, s) =\n(qT , M, \u015d = z1 z2 s; \u03b1S (M 2 )) ,\n2\n2\ndqT\ndqT\n0\n0\na,b\n(1)\nwhere\n(a = qf , q\u0304f , g) are the parton densities of the colliding hadrons (h1 and h2 ) at the\nfactorization scale \u03bcF , and d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 are the partonic cross sections. The centre\u2013of\u2013mass energy\nof the two colliding hadrons is denoted by s, and \u015d is the partonic centre\u2013of\u2013mass energy. We\nuse parton densities as defined in the MS factorization scheme, and \u03b1S (\u03bc2R ) is the QCD running\nfa/hi (x, \u03bc2F )\n\n2\n\n\fcoupling at the renormalization scale \u03bcR in the MS renormalization scheme. In Eq. (1) and\nthroughout the paper, the arbitrary factorization and renormalization scales, \u03bcF and \u03bcR , are set\nto be equal to the Higgs boson mass M.\nThe partonic cross sections d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 are computable in QCD perturbation theory as power\nseries expansions in \u03b1S (M 2 ). We are interested in the perturbative contributions that are large in\nthe small-qT region (qT \u226a M) and, eventually, singular in the limit qT \u2192 0. To explicitly present\nthe perturbative structure of these enhanced terms at small qT , we integrate the qT distribution\nover the region 0 \u2264 qT \u2264 Q0 , and we introduce the cumulative partonic cross section\nZ\n\n0\n\nQ20\n\ndqT2\n\nd\u03c3\u0302ab\n(0)\n(qT , M, \u015d = M 2 /z; \u03b1S (M 2 )) \u2261 z \u03c3H (\u03b1S (M 2 )) R\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ; \u03b1S (M 2 )) ,\n2\ndqT\n\n(2)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere the overall normalization of the function R\u0302ab is defined with respect to \u03c3H , which is the\nBorn level cross section for the partonic subprocess gg \u2192 H. Using the large-mtop approximation,\n(0)\nthe explicit expression of \u03c3H is [24]\n(0)\n\n\u03c3H (\u03b1S ) =\n\nGF \u03b1S2\n\u221a ,\n288 \u03c0 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant. The partonic function R\u0302 has the following perturbative expansion\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ; \u03b1S ) = \u03b4ga \u03b4gb \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) +\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u03b1S \u0011n\nn=1\n\n\u03c0\n\n(n)\n\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) .\n\n(4)\n\nThe next-to-leading order (NLO) and NNLO contributions to the cumulative cross section in\nEq. (2) are determined by the functions R\u0302(1) and R\u0302(2) , respectively. The small-qT region of the\ncross section d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 is probed by performing the limit Q0 \u226a M in Eq. (2). In this limit, the\nNLO and NNLO functions R\u0302(1) and R\u0302(2) have the following behaviour:\n(1)\n\n(1;2)\n\n(1;1)\n\n(2;3)\n\n(2;2)\n\n(1;0)\n\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) = l02 R\u0302ab (z) + l0 R\u0302ab (z) + R\u0302ab (z) + O(Q20 /M 2 ) ,\n(2)\n\n(2;4)\n\n(2;1)\n\n(5)\n\n(2;0)\n\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) = l04 R\u0302ab (z) + l03 R\u0302ab (z) + l02 R\u0302ab (z) + l0 R\u0302ab (z) + R\u0302ab (z) + O(Q20 /M 2 ) ,\n(6)\nwhere l0 = ln(M 2 /Q20 ). In Eqs. (5) and (6), the powers of the large logarithm l0 are produced\nby the singular (though, integrable) behaviour of d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 at small values of qT . The coefficients\nR\u0302(1;m) (with m \u2264 2) and R\u0302(2;m) (with m \u2264 4) of the large logarithms are independent of Q0 ;\nthese coefficients depend on the partonic centre\u2013of\u2013mass energy \u015d and, more precisely, they are\nfunctions of the energy fraction z = M 2 /\u015d.\nIn this paper we present the computation of the cumulative cross section in Eq. (2) up to\nNNLO. The partonic calculation is performed in analytic form by neglecting terms of O(Q20 /M 2 )\nin the limit Q0 \u226a M. Therefore, we determine the coefficient functions R\u0302(n;m) (z) in Eqs. (5) and\n(6). Before presenting the results, we illustrate how these functions are related to the perturbative\ncoefficients of the transverse-momentum resummation formula for Higgs boson production [3, 5].\nThis relation, which allows us to extract the qT resummation coefficients up to O(\u03b1S2 ), also shows\n3\n\n\fthat the knowledge of Eq. (6) is sufficient to fully determine the NNLO rapidity distribution of\nthe Higgs boson in the small-qT region.\n(sing)\n\nThe partonic cross section d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 in Eq. (1) can be decomposed in the form d\u03c3\u0302ab = d\u03c3\u0302ab +\n(reg)\n(sing)\nd\u03c3\u0302ab . The singular component, d\u03c3\u0302ab , contains all the contributions that are enhanced at\nsmall qT . These contributions are proportional to \u03b4(qT2 ) or to large logarithms\u00a7 of the type\n(reg)\n1\nlnm (M 2 /qT2 ). On the contrary, the remaining component, d\u03c3\u0302ab , of the partonic cross secq2\nT\n\n(reg)\n\ntion is regular order-by-order in \u03b1S as qT \u2192 0. To be precise, the integration of d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 over\nthe range 0 \u2264 qT \u2264 Q0 leads to a finite result that, at each fixed order in \u03b1S , vanishes in the\n(reg)\nlimit Q0 \u2192 0. Therefore, d\u03c3\u0302ab only contributes to the terms of O(Q20 /M 2 ) on the right-hand\nside of Eqs. (5) and (6). The decomposition of the partonic cross sections can be inserted in the\nright-hand side of Eq. (1), thus leading to the corresponding decomposition of the hadronic cross\nsection d\u03c3/dqT2 , namely, d\u03c3 = d\u03c3 (sing) + d\u03c3 (reg) .\nWe consider the singular component of the Higgs boson qT cross section, and we recall its\nall-order perturbative structure. We directly refer to the hadronic cross section (rather than the\npartonic cross sections), since its structure can be presented by using a more compact notation.\nMoreover, to illustrate the general kinematics of transverse-momentum resummation, we consider\nthe qT cross section d\u03c3/dy dqT2 at fixed value of the rapidity y of the Higgs boson (the rapidity\nis defined in the centre\u2013of\u2013mass frame of the two colliding hadrons). The transverse-momentum\nresummation formula for the singular component of the Higgs boson cross section is [3, 5]\nZ +\u221e\nd\u03c3 (sing)\nM 2 (0)\nb\n2\n\u03c3H (\u03b1S (M ))\n(y, qT , M, s) =\ndb J0 (bqT ) Sg (M, b)\n2\ndy dqT\ns\n2\n0\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\nX\n\u0003\ndz1\ndz2 \u0002 F\nH C1 C2 gg; a1 a2 fa1 /h1 (x1 /z1 , b20 /b2 ) fa2 /h2 (x2 /z2 , b20 /b2 ) , (7)\n\u00d7\nx1 z1\nx2 z2\na ,a\n1\n\n2\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere the kinematical variables xi (i = 1, 2) are x1 = e+y M/ s and x2 = e\u2212y M/ s.

The symbol H F C1 C2 gg; a1 a2\ndenotes (see Eq. (44) in Ref. [5]) the following function of the longitudinal-momentum fractions\nz1 and z2 :\n\u0002 H\n\u0003\n\u0002\nH C1 C2 gg; a1 a2 = HgH (\u03b1S (M 2 ))\nCg a1 (z1 ; \u03b1S (b20 /b2 )) Cg a2 (z2 ; \u03b1S (b20 /b2 ))\n\u0003\n(8)\n+ Gg a1 (z1 ; \u03b1S (b20 /b2 )) Gg a2 (z2 ; \u03b1S (b20 /b2 )) ,\n\nwhere HgH (\u03b1S ), Cg a (z; \u03b1S ) and Gg a (z; \u03b1S ) are perturbative functions of \u03b1S (see Eqs. (9)\u2013(11)). The\nother perturbative ingredients of Eq. (7) are the function Sg (M, b), which is the Sudakov form\n(0)\nfactor of the gluon (see the comments below), and \u03c3H (\u03b1S (M 2 )), which is the Born level cross\nsection in Eq. (3).\nThe structure of Eq. (7) is well known in the literature on resummed calculations for the qT\nspectrum of the Higgs boson. However, the functional form of Eq. (8) is new [5]. The customary\n\u00a7\n\n2\nTo be precise, the logarithms are combined with corresponding 'contact'\nterms, which\nh\ni are proportional to \u03b4(qT ).\n\nThese combinations define regularized (integrable) 'plus distributions'\n\n1\n2\nqT\n\nlnm (M 2 /qT2 )\n\n+\n\nwith respect to qT2 . The\n\ncumulative cross section in Eq. (2) is insensitive to the precise mathematical definition of these 'plus distributions'.\n\n4\n\n\f'na\u0131\u0308ve' version (i.e. the version extrapolated from the transverse-momentum resummation formula\nfor the Drell\u2013Yan process) of Eq. (8) includes only the perturbative functions HgH and Cg a . The\npresence of an additional term, due to the function Gg a , has been pointed out in Ref. [5]. Note\nthat the function Gg a (z; \u03b1S ) is of O(\u03b1S ) (see Eq. (9)) and, therefore, it leads to a contribution of\nO(\u03b1S2 ) in the right-hand side of Eq. (8). This fact implies that the presence of Gg a (z; \u03b1S ) cannot\nbe detected through a NLO calculation of the qT spectrum of the Higgs boson. This fact also\nimplies that our NNLO analytic calculation of the cumulative cross section in Eq. (2) gives an\nexplicit check of the presence of Gg a (z; \u03b1S ) and of its precise form at O(\u03b1S ) (see Eq. (28) and\nrelated comments).\nThe gluon form factor Sg (M, b) of Eq. (7) is a process-independent quantity [3, 8, 4]. Its\nfunctional dependence on M and b is controlled by two perturbative functions, which are usually\ndenoted as Ag (\u03b1S ) and Bg (\u03b1S ) (see, e.g., Eqs. (10)\u2013(12) in Ref. [5]). Their corresponding n-th\n(n)\n(n)\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\norder perturbative coefficients are Ag and Bg . The coefficients Ag , Bg , Ag [8] and Bg [9]\nare known: their knowledge fully determines the perturbative expression of Sg (M, b) up to O(\u03b1S2 ).\n\u0002\n\u0003\nThe quantity H F C1 C2 in Eq. (7) depends on the three perturbative functions HgH , Cg a and\nGg a . By inspection of the right-hand side of Eq. (8), we notice that the scale of \u03b1S is not set\nto a unique value. We have \u03b1S (M 2 ) in the case of the function HgH (\u03b1S ), and \u03b1S (b20 /b2 ) in the\ncase of the functions Cg a (\u03b1S ) and Gg a (\u03b1S ). The presence of these two different arguments of \u03b1S is\nrelated to the physical origin [4, 5] of the corresponding perturbative functions. Roughly speaking,\nHgH (\u03b1S (M 2 )) embodies contributions due to the hard-momentum region\u2020 of the virtual corrections\nto the lowest-order subprocess gg \u2192 H. The functions Cg a and Gg a instead refer to the inclusive\nsubprocess g a \u2192 H + X: roughly speaking, Cg a (\u03b1S (b20 /b2 )) and Gg a (\u03b1S (b20 /b2 )) originate from\nthe kinematical region where the momenta of the partons in the final-state system X are (almost)\ncollinear \u0002to the momentum\nof the initial-state parton a. Owing to this physical picture, the\n\u0003\nquantity H F C1 C2 can be regarded as a hard-collinear partonic function. Note that the function\nHgH (\u03b1S ) is process dependent, since it is directly related to the production mechanism of the SM\nHiggs boson. On the contrary, the partonic functions Cg a and Gg a are process independent, as a\nconsequence of the universality features of QCD collinear radiation.\nWe recall that the functions HgH (\u03b1S ), Cg a (\u03b1S ), Gg a (\u03b1S ) and the perturbative function Bg (\u03b1S )\nof the gluon form factor are not separately computable in an unambiguous way. Indeed, these four\nfunctions are correlated (constrained) by a renormalization-group symmetry [4] that is related\nto the b-space factorization structure of Eqs. (7) and (8). The unambiguous definition of these\nfour functions thus requires the specification\u2021 of a resummation scheme [4]. Note, however, that\nconsidering the perturbative expansion\u00a7 of Eq. (7) (i.e., the perturbative expansion of the singular\ncomponent of the qT cross section), the resummation-scheme dependence exactly cancels orderby-order in \u03b1S .\nThe perturbative expansion of the three functions on the right-hand side of Eq. (8) is defined\n\u2020\n\nThis is the region where the size of the momenta of the virtual loops is of the order of M .\nThe reader who is not interested in issues related to the specification of a resummation scheme can simply\nassume that HgH (\u03b1S ) \u2261 1 throughout this paper.\n\u00a7\nThe resummation-scheme dependence also cancels by consistently expanding Eq. (7) in terms of classes of\nresummed (leading, next-to-leading and so forth) logarithmic contributions [19].\n\u2021\n\n5\n\n\fas follows:\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u03b1S (1)\n\u03b1S \u0011n (n)\nGg a (z; \u03b1S ) =\nGg a (z) +\nGg a (z) ,\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nn=2\n\nCg a (z; \u03b1S ) = \u03b4g a \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) +\nHgH (\u03b1S )\n\n=1+\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u03b1S \u0011n\nn=1\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u03b1S \u0011n\nn=1\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n(9)\n\nCg(n)\na (z) ,\n\n(10)\n\nHgH(n) .\n\n(11)\n\nSince the partonic functions Gg a and Cg a are process independent, they fulfil the following relations:\nGg qf (z; \u03b1S ) = Gg q\u0304f \u2032 (z; \u03b1S ) \u2261 Gg q (z; \u03b1S ) ,\n\nCg qf (z; \u03b1S ) = Cg q\u0304f \u2032 (z; \u03b1S ) \u2261 Cg q (z; \u03b1S ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich are a consequence of charge conjugation invariance and flavour symmetry of QCD. The\ndependence of Gg a (Cg a ) on the parton label a is thus fully specified by Gg g and Gg q (Cg g\n(1)\n(1)\nand Cg q ). The first-order coefficient functions Gg g (z) and Gg q (z) (they are independent of the\nresummation scheme) are known [5]:\nG(1)\ng g (z) = CA\n\n1\u2212z\n,\nz\n\nG(1)\ng q (z) = CF\n\n1\u2212z\n.\nz\n\n(13)\n\n(1)\n\nThe first-order coefficient function Cg q (z) is also independent on the resummation scheme; its\nexpression is [27]\n1\n(14)\nCg(1)q (z) = CF z .\n2\nH(1)\n\nUsing the large-mtop approximation, the first-order coefficients Hg\ning relation [9]:\nCg(1)g (z) +\n\n(1)\n\nand Cg g (z) fulfil the follow-\n\n1 H(1)\n(5 + \u03c0 2 )CA \u2212 3CF\nHg \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) =\n\u03b4(1 \u2212 z) .\n2\n4\n(1)\n\n(15)\n\nH(1)\n\nThe separate determination of Cg g (z) and Hg\nrequires the specification of a resummation\nscheme. For instance, considering the resummation scheme in which the SM Higgs boson coefficient\nH(1)\n(1)\nHg\nvanishes, the right-hand side of Eq. (15) gives the value of Cg g (z) [27], and the corresponding\n(2)\nvalue of the gluon form factor coefficient Bg is explicitly reported in Eq. (128) of the second paper\n(2)\n(2)\nH(2)\nin Ref. [9]. The computation of the second-order coefficients Cg q , Cg g and Hg\nis the aim of the\ncalculation described in this paper.\nFor later purposes, we also define the following hard-collinear coefficient function:\nZ 1\nZ 1\nh\ni\nH\nH\nHgg\u2190ab (z; \u03b1S ) \u2261 Hg (\u03b1S ) dz1\ndz2 \u03b4(z\u2212z1 z2 ) Cg a (z1 ; \u03b1S )Cg b (z2 ; \u03b1S )+Gg a (z1 ; \u03b1S )Gg b (z2 ; \u03b1S ) ,\n0\n\n0\n\n(16)\nwhich is directly related to the coefficient function in Eq. (8). There are only two differences\nbetween Eqs. (8) and (16). The first difference is due to the fact that the function HH depends\non the energy fraction z, since the right-hand side of Eq. (16) involves a convolution integral\nover the momentum fractions z1 and z2 . This convolution kinematically arises by considering the\n6\n\n\fintegration of Eq. (7) over the rapidity y of the Higgs boson. The second difference regards the\nscale of \u03b1S : in the functions H H (\u03b1S ), C(\u03b1S ) and G(\u03b1S ) on the right-hand side of Eq. (16), the\nargument of \u03b1S is set to the same value (this common scale is not explicitly denoted in Eq. (16)).\nH\nOwing to this feature, the process-dependent function Hgg\u2190ab\nis unambiguously defined (i.e., it is\nindependent of the specification of the resummation scheme) [4]. The perturbative expansion of\nthe function HH directly follows from Eqs. (9)\u2013(11). We have:\nH\nHgg\u2190ab\n(z; \u03b1S ) = \u03b4g a \u03b4g b \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) +\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u03b1S \u0011n\nn=1\n\n\u03c0\n\nH(n)\n\nHgg\u2190ab (z) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the first-order and second-order contributions are\nH(1)\n\n(1)\n\nHgg\u2190ab (z) = \u03b4g a \u03b4g b \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) HgH(1) + \u03b4g a Cg b (z) + \u03b4g b Cg(1)a (z) ,\nH(2)\nHgg\u2190ab (z)\n\nz) HgH(2)\n\n(2)\n\u03b4g a Cg b (z)\n\n\u03b4g b Cg(2)a (z)\n\n= \u03b4g a \u03b4g b \u03b4(1 \u2212\n+\n+\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n(1)\n(1)\n+ Cg(1)a \u2297 Cg b (z) + G(1)\ng a \u2297 Gg b (z) .\n\n+\n\nHgH(1)\n\n(18)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(1)\n(1)\n\u03b4g a Cg b (z) + \u03b4g b Cg a (z)\n\n(19)\n\nIn Eq. (19) and in the following, the symbol \u2297 denotes the convolution integral (i.e., we define\nR1\nR1\n(g \u2297 h)(z) \u2261 0 dz1 0 dz2 \u03b4(z \u2212 z1 z2 ) g(z1 ) h(z2 )).\n\nAfter our illustration of the all-order resummation formula in Eq. (7), we can return to its\nrelation with the perturbative expression of the cumulative partonic cross section in Eq. (2). Using\nthe Altarelli\u2013Parisi evolution equations, the parton densities fa/h (x, b20 /b2 ) on the right-hand side\nof Eq. (7) can be expressed in terms of the corresponding parton densities fa/h (x, M 2 ) at the\nfactorization (evolution) scale \u03bcF = M. Having done that, all the remaining factors in Eq. (7)\nare the partonic contributions that determine the small-qT singular component of the Higgs boson\npartonic cross section d\u03c3\u0302ab /dqT2 in Eqs. (1) and (2). At fixed values of the impact parameter b, all\nthese partonic contributions can be expanded in powers of \u03b1S (M 2 ), thus leading to perturbative\ncoefficients that depend on powers of ln(b2 M 2 ). The dependence on ln(b2 M 2 ) is produced by the\ngluon form factor Sg (M, b), by the Altarelli\u2013Parisi evolution equations and by the QCD coupling\u2021\n\u03b1S (b20 /b2 ). The powers of ln(b2 M 2 ) can then be transformed into logarithms, ln(M 2 /qT2 ), in qT space by explicitly performing the Bessel transformation (i.e. the integration over b) in Eq. (7).\nThis procedure, which involves manipulations that are standard in the context of transversemomentum resummation (technical details can be found, for instance, in Ref. [19]), yields the\nexplicit perturbative expression of the singular component of d\u03c3\u0302ab /d\u0177dqT2 . The integration of this\nexpression over \u0177 (\u0177 is the rapidity of the Higgs boson in the centre\u2013of\u2013mass frame of the two\ncolliding partons) and qT finally gives the cumulative partonic cross section of Eqs. (2) and (4)\nin the limit Q0 \u226a M (i.e., modulo the contributions of O(Q20 /M 2 ) in Eqs. (5) and (6)). The\n(n)\nperturbative functions R\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) of Eq. (4) have a dependence on l0 = ln(M 2 /Q20 ) that is\nexplicitly determined by the resummation formula (7), whereas the dependence on z is given in\nterms of the qT resummation coefficients (those of the gluon form factor and in Eqs. (9)\u2013(11)).\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe NLO and NNLO functions R\u0302ab and R\u0302ab have the following expressions:\n(1)\n\nH(1;2)\n\nH(1;1)\n\nH(1)\n\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) = l02 \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z) + l0 \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z) + Hgg\u2190ab (z) + O(Q20 /M 2 ) ,\n\n(20)\n\nThe coupling \u03b1S (b20 /b2 ) can be expressed in terms of \u03b1S (M 2 ) and ln(b2 M 2 /b20 ) by using the renormalization\ngroup equation for the perturbative \u03bc2 -evolution of the running coupling \u03b1S (\u03bc2 ).\n\u2021\n\n7\n\n\f(2)\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 )\n\n=\n\nl04\n\nH(2;4)\n\u03a3gg\u2190ab (z)\n\nl03\n\nH(2;3)\n\u03a3gg\u2190ab (z)\n\nl02\n\nH(2;2)\n\u03a3gg\u2190ab (z)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nH(2;1)\nH(2;4)\n+ l0 \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z) \u2212 16\u03b63 \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z)\n\n+\n+\n\u0010\n\u0011\nH(2)\nH(2;3)\n+ Hgg\u2190ab (z) \u2212 4\u03b63 \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z) + O(Q20 /M 2 ) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich are consistent with the behaviour in Eqs. (5) and (6). In Eqs. (20) and (21) we use the\nH(n;m)\nsame notation as in Ref. [19]. The coefficient functions \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z) depend on the qT resummation\ncoefficients: the explicit expressions are given in Eqs. (63),(64),(66)\u2013(69) of Ref. [19] (we have\nto set \u03bcR = \u03bcF = Q = M, where \u03bcR , \u03bcF and Q are the auxiliary scales of Ref. [19]) and\nH(1)\nH(2)\nare not reported here. The coefficients Hgg\u2190ab and Hgg\u2190ab are exactly those in Eqs. (18) and\nH(1;2)\n\nH(1;1)\n\n(19). The first-order terms \u03a3gg\u2190ab and \u03a3gg\u2190ab depend on the gluon form factor Sg (M, b). The\nH(2;m)\nH(1)\nsecond-order terms \u03a3gg\u2190ab depend on Hgg\u2190ab and on the gluon form factor Sg (M, b) up to O(\u03b1S2 ).\nThe numerical coefficient \u03b63 \u2243 1.202 . . . (\u03b6k is the Riemann \u03b6-function) on the right-hand side of\nEq. (21) originates from the Bessel transformations (see, e.g., Eqs. (B.18) and (B.30) in Appendix B\nof Ref. [19]).\n\nThe relations (20) and (21) can be exploited in two different ways. From the knowledge of the\nperturbative coefficients of the resummation formulae (7) and (8), we can compute \u03a3H(n;m) and\nHH(n) and then, we can obtain a perturbative prediction for the cumulative partonic cross section\nup to NNLO. Alternatively, from the explicit NNLO perturbative computation of the cumulative\npartonic cross section, we can extract \u03a3H(n;m) and HH(n) and then, we can determine the qT\nresummation coefficients up to O(\u03b1S2 ).\n\n8\n\n\fOur NNLO computation of the cumulative partonic cross section is described in the final\npart of this paper. We obtain the following results. The explicit result of the NLO function\n(1)\nH(1;2)\nH(1;1)\nH(1)\nR\u0302ab (z) confirms the expressions of \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z), \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z) and Hgg\u2190ab (z), as predicted by the qT\nresummation coefficients at O(\u03b1S ). At NNLO, the present knowledge [8, 9] of the qT resummation\nH(2;m)\ncoefficients at O(\u03b1S2 ) predicts the expressions of the terms \u03a3gg\u2190ab (z), with m = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(12) and from the convolution integral in Eq. (16)\nH\n(the convolution integral implies that Hgg\u2190ab\nis symmetric with respect to the exchange a \u2194 b).\nH(2)\nTherefore, the parton matrix Hgg\u2190ab is completely specified by the three entries in Eqs. (22)\u2013(24):\nH(2)\n\nH(2)\n\nthe quark\u2013quark function Hgg\u2190qq , the gluon\u2013quark function Hgg\u2190gq and the gluon\u2013gluon function\nH(2)\nHgg\u2190gg .\nUsing Eq. (19), in the quark\u2013quark channel we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\nH(2)\n(1)\nHgg\u2190qq\n(z) = Cg(1)q \u2297 Cg(1)q (z) + G(1)\ng q \u2297 Gg q (z) .\n\n(28)\n\nH(2)\n\nWe see that the second-order coefficient function Hgg\u2190qq (z) is fully determined by the qT resumma(1)\n(1)\ntion coefficients at O(\u03b1S ). Using the values of Gg q and Cg q in Eqs. (13) and (14), the expression\non the right-hand side of Eq. (28) is in complete agreement with the result in Eq. (22). Therefore,\n(2)\nour explicit computation of the NNLO partonic function R\u0302qq represents a consistency check of the\n(1)\nfactorization formula (8) and of the value of Gg q , which were derived in the process-independent\nstudy of Ref. [5].\nConsidering the gluon\u2013quark channel, Eq. (19) can be recast in the following form:\nCg(2)q (z) +\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1 H(1) (1)\nH(1)\n(1)\nH(2)\nHgg\u2190gg\n\u2297 Cg(1)q (z) \u2212 G(1)\n\u2297\nG\nHg Cg q (z) = Hgg\u2190gq\n(z) \u2212\ngg\ng q (z) ,\n2\n2\nH(1)\n\nH(1)\n\n(29)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have used Hgg\u2190gg (z) = Hg \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) + 2 Cg g (z) (see Eq. (18)). The relation (29) can\n(2)\nH(2)\nbe used to determine Cg q (z) from the knowledge of Hgg\u2190gq and of the qT resummation coefficients\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\nat O(\u03b1S ) (in particular, the values of Gg g and Gg q affect the determination of Cg q ). Inserting\nthe first-order results of Eqs. (13)\u2013(15) in Eq. (29), we explicitly have:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n5 + \u03c02 2\n1 H(1)\n1\n(2)\nH(2)\n2 3\nCg q (z) + Hg CF z = Hgg\u2190gq (z) + CF z + CF CA (1 + z) ln z + 2(1 \u2212 z) \u2212\nz ,\n4\n8\nz\n8\n(30)\nH(2)\nwhere Hgg\u2190gq is given in Eq. (23). Note that the right-hand side of Eq. (29) (or Eq. (30))\n(2)\nis resummation-scheme independent. Analogously to Eq. (15), the dependence of Cg q on the\nH(1)\nresummation scheme is thus parametrized by the first-order coefficient Hg\non the left-hand side\nof Eq. (30).\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nThe process-independent coefficient function Cg g (z) is obtained analogously to Cg q (z). Considering the gluon\u2013gluon channel, Eq.

(13)\u2013(15) in Eq. (31), we explicitly obtain:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n(5 + \u03c0 2 )CA \u2212 3CF H(1)\n3\nH(1) 2\n(2)\nH(2)\nHg\n+\nHg\n+\n2 Cg g (z) + \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) Hg\n\u2212\n4\n4\n\u0014\n\u00152\n(5 + \u03c0 2 )CA \u2212 3CF\n1\nH(2)\n= Hgg\u2190gg (z) \u2212 \u03b4(1 \u2212 z)\n+ CA2 [(1 + z) ln z + 2(1 \u2212 z)] ,\n4\nz\nH(2)\n\n(32)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Hgg\u2190gg is given in Eq. (24). We observe that Cg g (z) includes a resummation-scheme\nH(1)\nH(2)\ndependent part that is simply proportional to \u03b4(1 \u2212 z). This part depends on Hg\nand Hg .\n(2)\nH(2)\nWe also recall [4] that the resummation-scheme invariance relates Cg g , Hg\nand the third-order\n(3)\ncoefficient Bg of the gluon form factor.\nWe conclude the paper by briefly describing the method that we have used to perform the\nNNLO analytic computation of the Higgs boson cross section in Eq. (2). The NNLO partonic calculation has to be carried out by using dimensional regularization to evaluate the QCD scattering\namplitudes and their integration over the partonic phase space. In the framework of the large-mtop\napproximation, the relevant partonic subprocesses are: the gluon fusion subprocess gg \u2192 H up\nto the two-loop level, the single-emission subprocesses ab \u2192 H + c up to the one-loop level, and\nthe double-emission subprocesses ab \u2192 H + c1 + c2 at the tree level. The corresponding scattering\namplitudes are known and have been used in the analytic calculations of two relevant Higgs boson\n(tot)\nobservables: the NNLO total cross section \u03c3\u0302ab [28, 29, 30] and the NLO differential cross section\nd\u03c3\u0302ab /d\u0177 dqT2 [31, 32] at large qT . To perform our NNLO calculation, we take advantage of these\navailable results: both observables are indeed computed up to relative order \u03b1S2 with respect to\n(0)\nthe Born level cross section \u03c3H (\u03b1S ). We rewrite the qT integration in Eq. (2) as follows:\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\nZ Q20\nd\u03c3\u0302ab\n2 d\u03c3\u0302ab\n2 d\u03c3\u0302ab\n(qT , M, \u015d; \u03b1S ) \u2261\n(qT , M, \u015d; \u03b1S ) \u2212\n(qT , M, \u015d; \u03b1S )\ndqT\ndqT2\ndqT\n2\n2\ndqT\ndqT\ndqT2\n0\nQ20\n0\nZ \u221e\nZ +\u221e\nd\u03c3\u0302ab\n(tot)\n2\n= \u03c3\u0302ab (M, \u015d; \u03b1S ) \u2212\ndqT\nd\u0177\n(\u0177, qT , M, \u015d; \u03b1S ) . (33)\nd\u0177 dqT2\nQ20\n\u2212\u221e\nThe cumulative partonic cross section over the range 0 < qT < Q0 is thus obtained by subtraction\n(tot)\naccording to Eq. (33): we start from the total cross section\u00a7 \u03c3\u0302ab and we subtract the contribution\ndue to the qT cross section in the 'large'-qT region where qT > Q0 (in the context of Eq. (33),\n'large' values of qT generically means 'non-vanishing' values of qT ). The differential cross section\nd\u03c3\u0302ab /d\u0177 dqT2 in the integrand on the right-hand side of Eq. (33) is presented in Ref. [31] in complete\nanalytic form: we use this form and we explicitly carried out the integrations over \u0177 and qT . Since\nqT > Q0 , these integrations can directly be performed in four space-time dimensions, with no\nfurther use of dimensional regularization. At NLO, the cumulative partonic cross section can\nbe computed in explicit analytic form for arbitrary values of Q0 , and the analytic result [33] is\nrecalled below. At the NNLO, we limit ourselves to analytically computing the cumulative cross\nsection in the limit Q0 \u226a M, thus neglecting the terms of O(Q20 /M 2 ) on the right-hand side of\nEqs. (6) or (21).\nThe NLO analytic result for the cumulative partonic cross section in Eqs. (2) and (33) was\nalready presented in Ref. [33]. Indeed, at the NLO, the cumulative cross section exactly coincides\nWe actually use the expressions of Ref. [30], which are given for general colour factors, CF = (Nc2 \u2212 1)/(2Nc)\nand CA = Nc , of SU (Nc ).\n\u00a7\n\n12\n\n\fwith the jet-vetoed cross section \u03c3 veto in Sect. 4 of Ref. [33], provided we identify Q0 = pveto\nT ,\nveto\nwhere pT is the jet veto parameter. Considering arbitrary values of Q0 , the NLO function\n(1)\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) of Eqs. (2) and (4) has the following form [33]:\n(1)\n\nveto(1)\n\nR\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) = Gab\n\n(1) (tot)\n\n(z; \u03c0T ) = Gab\n\n(1)\n\n(z) \u2212 \u2206Gab (z; \u03c0T ) \u0398(1 \u2212 \u03c0T ) ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the variable \u03c0T depends on z and Q0 /M,\n\u221a\n2Q0 z\n.\n\u03c0T = \u03c0T (z, Q0 /M) \u2261\n(1 \u2212 z)M\n\n(35)\n\nThe two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (34) are in one-to-one correspondence with the\nNLO contribution to the two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (33). The partonic functions\n(1)\n(1) (tot)\n\u2206Gab (z; \u03c0T ) are presented in Eq. (20) of Ref. [33], and Gab\n(z) are the partonic functions of the\n(1) (tot)\n(1)\nNLO total cross section [34] (Gab\nis denoted by Gab in Ref. [33], and we have introduced the\nsuperscript '(tot)' to avoid confusion with the functions in our Eq. (13)). The explicit expressions of\n(1) (tot)\nGab\n(z) can be found in Eqs. (2.7)\u2013(2.9) of Ref. [35], which uses the same overall normalization\nas in Eq. (34).\n(1;k)\n\nThe NLO coefficient functions R\u0302ab (z) (k = 0, 1, 2) of Eq. (5) are obtained by performing\nthe logarithmic expansion of the right-hand side of Eq. (34) at small values of Q0 . The limit\n(1;k)\nQ0 \u226a M of Eq. (34) is not completely straightforward, since the functions R\u0302ab (z) contain 'plus'distributions of the variable z. To illustrate this point we consider, for example, the complete\n(1)\nexpression of \u2206Ggg (z; \u03c0T ) in Eq. (20) of Ref. [33] and, neglecting terms that trivially vanish if\nQ0 \u2192 0, we obtain\n\n11 (1 \u2212 z)3\n\u2206G(1)\n(z;\n\u03c0\n)\n\u0398(1\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n)\n=\n\u2212\nC\nT\nT\nA\ngg\n6z\ns\n\"\n!# \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\u0013\n4Q20\n2Q0\nQ0\n(1 \u2212 z)M\n\u221a\n+2 P\u0302gg (z) ln\n+O\n\u0398 1\u2212z\u2212\n, (36)\n1+ 1\u2212 2\n2\nM (1 \u2212 z)\nM\nM2\n2 z Q0\n\nwhere P\u0302gg (z) (see Eq.

(36) is due to the fact that P\u0302gg (z) is\nproportional to 1/(1 \u2212 z) and, thus, singular when z \u2192 1. At finite values of Q0 this singularity\nis screened by the \u0398-function in Eq. (36), and the limit Q0 \u2192 0 has to be properly treated by\nintroducing customary (mathematical) distributions, such as \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) and '+'-distributions (see,\ne.g., Eq. (9) in Ref. [33]), that act onto smooth functions defined over the range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1. In\nthe specific case of Eq. (36), these distributions occur in the following expressions:\n\u0013 \u0014 k\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nln (1 \u2212 z)\n(\u22121)k k+1 M\nQ0\n2Q0\nlnk (1 \u2212 z)\n=\n+\n\u03b4(1 \u2212 z) + O\n, (37)\n\u0398 1\u2212z\u2212\nln\n1\u2212z\nM\n1\u2212z\nk+1\n2Q0\nM\n+\ns\n\"\n!# \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n\u03c0\n2Q0\n1 2\nQ0\n1\n4Q20\n1+ 1\u2212 2\n= \u2212 + ln 2 \u03b4(1\u2212z)+O\n.\nln\n\u0398 1\u2212z\u2212\n2\n1\u2212z\n2\nM (1 \u2212 z)\nM\n24 2\nM\n(38)\nInserting Eqs. (37) and (38) in Eqs. (36) and (34), we obtain the logarithmic expansions in Eqs. (5)\nH(1;2)\nH(1;1)\nand (20), and the reader can directly crosscheck the correct values of \u03a3gg\u2190gg (z), \u03a3gg\u2190gg (z) (see\nH(1)\nEqs. (63) and (64) in Ref. [19]) and Hgg\u2190gg (see Eq. (84) in Ref. [19], or Eqs. (15) and (18) herein).\n13\n\n\fH(2)\n\nOur explicit computation of the coefficient functions Hgg\u2190ab and, more generally, of the NNLO\n(2)\nfunction R\u0302ab (z, M/Q0 ) in Eq. (21) closely follows the same steps that we have just illustrated at\nthe NLO. The details are too complicated and lengthy to present here. Using Eq. (33), we obtain\n(2)\nthe NNLO analogue of Eq. (34) and the corresponding partonic function \u2206Gab arises from the qT\n(and y) integration of the last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (33). We carry out this analytic\nintegration by neglecting terms that trivially vanish if Q0 \u2192 0, and we obtain an NNLO analytic\nexpression that is (conceptually) analogous to Eq. (36). The final step of the NNLO calculation is\nanalogous to that in Eqs. (37) and (38), and it involves a proper treatment of the limit Q0 \u226a M\nfor several functions that become singular at the endpoint z = 1.\nIn this paper we have considered the production of the SM Higgs boson at hadron colliders.\nWe have presented the NNLO analytic calculation of the cross section at small values of qT\n(see Eqs. (2) and (6)). The NNLO result is compared (see Eq. (21)) with the predictions of\ntransverse-momentum resummation (see Eqs. (7) and (8)). The comparison gives a crosscheck\nof the factorization formula (8) (see also Eq. (28)) and allows us to determine the previously\nH(2)\nunknown resummation coefficients at O(\u03b1S2 ). These are the coefficient functions Hgg\u2190ab (z) (see\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nEqs. (22)\u2013(24)) and the related coefficients Cg q and Cg g (see Eqs. (30) and (32)), which control the\ndependence on the rapidity of the Higgs boson. These coefficients can be implemented in resummed\ncalculations of the inclusive qT distribution at full NNLL accuracy. Using the method of Ref. [11],\nthe same coefficients are necessary to perform the fully-exclusive perturbative calculation up to\nNNLO.\n\nAcknowledgements.
