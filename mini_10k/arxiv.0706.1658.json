In this work\nwe discuss the discrimination power of the instrument for earth skimming tau neutrinos with ultra-high\nenergies. Based on the data collected since January 2004 an upper limit to the diffuse flux of neutrinos at\nEeVenergies is presented and systematic uncertainties are discussed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSearch for neutrinos\n\nThe nature and the production mechanism of the\ncosmic rays of ultra-high energy (UHE), above\n1019 eV, is still unknown. All proposed mechanisms are expected to produce neutrinos. Classical\nacceleration process of charged particles in astrophysical objects create neutrinos through interactions with the radiation within the source region\nor with the Cosmic Microwave Background (GZK\nneutrinos) [1]. In other type scenarios they arise\nas direct or indirect products of supermassive particles. The \u03c4 neutrinos are heavily suppressed at\nproduction. In the scenario of neutrino flavor oscillation and a maximal \u039823 mixing, the flavor balance changes when neutrinos reach the earth. After\ntravelling cosmological distances, approximately\nequal fluxes for each flavor are obtained [2]. Tau\nneutrinos that enter the earth just below the horizon, the so-called skimming neutrinos, may undergo a charged-current interaction to produce a \u03c4 .\nWhen the interaction happens close to the surface a\n\u03c4 can exit the earth and its decay in the atmosphere\ncan produce an Extended Air Shower (EAS) detectable with the Pierre Auger Observatory [3]. In\nthe EeVrange, this channel has been shown to increase the prospect of detecting UHE neutrinos [4].\n\nUHE particles interacting in the atmosphere give\nrise to EAS with the electromagnetic component\nreaching its maximal development after a depth of\nthe order of 1000 g cm\u22122 and extinguishing gradually within the next 1000 g cm\u22122 . After a couple\nof vertical atmospheric depths only the muons survive. As a consequence very inclined showers induced by nuclei (or possibly photons) in the upper\natmosphere reach the ground as a thin and flat front\nof hard muons. On the contrary, if a shower begins development deep in the atmosphere (a tau decay) its electromagnetic component can reach the\nground and give a distinct broad signal. Therefore,\nthe detection of very inclined showers with a significant electromagnetic component are a clear indication for UHE neutrinos.\nThe signal in each station of the surface detector\nis digitised using FADCs, allowing us to unambiguously distinguish the narrow signals from the\nbroad ones and thus to discriminate stations with\nand without electromagnetic component (figure 1).\nWe tag the stations for which the main segment of\nits FADC trace has 13 or more neighbour bins over\nthe threshold of 0.2 VEM [5] and the area over\npeak ratio [6] is larger than 1.4. The event is selected if the tagged stations fulfil the trigger condition and they contain most of the signal. After this\n\n\fN EUTRINO LIMIT FROM P IERRE AUGER O BSERVATORY\n\nAcceptance and neutrino limit\nBoth the criteria to identify neutrino induced showers and the calculation of the \u03bd\u03c4 acceptance are\nbased on Monte Carlo techniques. The former uses\nthe simulation of the shower development in the\natmosphere as well as the detector response. The\nlatter needs the simulation of the interactions that\nhappen while the neutrino crosses the earth [7].\nThe total acceptance collected from January 2004\nuntil December 2006 with the Pierre Auger Observatory is the time integration of the instantaneous\naperture.\n\nAcc(E\u03bd ) =\nFigure 1: FADC traces from a station of two different real showers after subtraction of baseline and\ncalibration. Top: moderately inclined (40\u25e6 ); bottom: quasi-horizontal (80\u25e6).\n\n0\n\nE\u03bd\n\ndE\u03c4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndhc\n\n\u0012\n\nd2 N\u03c4\nAcc\u03c4\ndE\u03c4 dhc\n\n\u0013\n\nAcc\u03c4 (E\u03c4 , hc ) =\nZ\nZ\ndxdy Ief f (E\u03c4 , hc , x, y, AConf (t))\ndt\n=\nT\n\nselection, an almost pure sample of young showers\nis isolated.\nThe next step uses the footprint of local stations\nincluded in the global trigger to select very inclined showers. First a tensor is built using the station signals and the ground positions (in analogy\nto the inertia tensor) and the corresponding major and minor axes are used to define a \"length\"\nand a \"width\". Then, for each pair (i,j) of tanks,\na \"ground speed\" is defined as di,j /|\u2206ti,j |, where\ndi,j is the distance between them (projected onto\nthe major axis) and |\u2206ti,j | is the difference between the start times of their signals. Horizontal\nshowers have an elongated shaped (large value of\nlength/width) and they have ground speeds tightly\nconcentrated around the speed of light. In figure 2,\nwe show the distributions of these discriminating\nvariables for real events and simulated tau showers. The following cuts are applied: length/width\n> 5, average speed \u2208 (0.29,0.31) m ns\u22121 and\nr.m.s.(speed) < 0.08 m ns\u22121 . We keep about 80\n% of the \u03c4 showers that trigger the surface detector. The final sample is expected to be free of background.\n\nZ\n\nA\n\nwhere dN\u03c4 /dE\u03c4 dhc is the flux of emerging \u03c4 s and\nIef f the probability to identify a \u03c4 . It depends on\nthe energy of the \u03c4 (E\u03c4 ), the altitude of the shower\ncenter defined 10 km after the decay point (hc )\n[4], the instantaneous configuration of the detector\n(AConf (t)), and the relative position of the shower\nfootprint in the array (x, y).\nThe Acc(E\u03bd ) is computed by Monte Carlo in two\nindependent steps. First, the integral on time and\narea are performed using the simulations of the\nEAS and the detector, allowing us to account for\nthe time evolution of the detector. The second\nstep computes the integral on hc and E\u03c4 by adding\nAcc\u03c4 (E\u03c4 , hc ) for all emerging \u03c4 , given by the simulation of the earth interactions. The statistical precision due to the statistic of the Monte Carlo simulation is at a few percent level.\nThe Monte Carlo simulations use several physical magnitudes that have not been experimentally\nmeasured at the relevant energy range, namely the\n\u03bd cross-section, the \u03c4 energy losses and the \u03c4 polarisation. We estimate the uncertainty in the acceptance due to the first two to be 15% and 40% respectively, based on Particle Distribution Function\n(PDF) uncertianties. The two polarizations give\n30% difference in acceptance. We take it as the\ncorresponding uncertainty.

Different extrapolations to\nlow x and high Q2 would lead to a wide range of\nvalues for the \u03bd cross-section as well as the \u03c4 energy losses. The uncertainties on the low x regime\nas well as possible large \u03bd cross-sections have not\nbeen added on the quoted systematics.\nWe also took into account uncertainties coming\nfrom neglecting the actual topography around the\nsite of the Pierre Auger Observatory (18%). We\nare confident on the simulations of the interactions\nundergoing in the earth at 5 % level. And we quote\na 25 % systematic uncertainty due to Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the EAS and the detector.\nData from January 2004 until December 2006,\nwhich equate to about 1 year from the completed\nsurface detector, have been analysed. In figure\n3, we show the collected acceptance on the analysed period, for the most and least favourable scenarios of the systematics. Over that period, there\nis not a single event that fulfils the selection criteria. Based on that, the Pierre Auger Observatory data can be used to put a limit for an injected spectrum K * \u03a6(E) with a known shape.\nFor an E\u22122 incident spectrum of diffuse \u03bd\u03c4 , the\n90% CL limit is E\u03bd2 * dN\u03bd\u03c4 /dE\u03bd < 1.5+0.5\n\u22120.8\n10\u22127 GeV cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121 , where the uncertainties come from the systematics.

For each experiment, the flavors to which is sensitive are stated.\n\nSummary and Prospects\nThe dataset from January 2004 until December\n2006, collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory,\nis used to present upper limits on the diffuse incident \u03bd\u03c4 flux. The skimming technique is flavor\nsensitive and together with the configuration of the\nsurface detector gives the best sensitivity around\nfew EeV, which is the most relevant energy to explore GZK neutrinos. The limit is still considerably higher than GZK neutrino predictions. Neutrinos that interact in the atmosphere can also be\ndistinguished from nucleon showers [7]. Hence,\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory can explore UHE \u03bds\nwith two techniques that depend differently on \u03bd\nproperties like flavour or cross-section. The Pierre\nAuger Observatory will keep taking data for about\n20 years over which the bound will improve by\nover an order of magnitude if no neutrino candidate is found.\n\n[1] V.S.
