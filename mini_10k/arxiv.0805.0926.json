This TCAD tool consists of a series of\nmodules [1] that integrate, for example, SoftMEMS system-\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nlevel tools with detailed process simulators such as the etch\nsimulator SUZANA [2] as well as process design tools with\na link to process-, material- and media databases [3]. This\napproach combines system-level behavioral simulation and\ncomponent-level design tools to provide engineers with a\ncomplete view of the overall design process.\nMost of today's MEMS-EDA / TCAD environments focus\non integrated behavioral simulation of electronic and\nmechanical components [4, 5]. Fabrication technologies are\nconsidered to be a fixed sequence of well known process\nsteps, which cannot be varied. Therefore, the main focus of\nthe designer is on adapting the layout needed to meet the\ndesired performance requirements of a device. There have\nbeen many academic publications regarding behavioral\nmodeling and system-level design approaches around the\nturn of the millennium [6, 7, 8].\nRecently there has been discussion that the gap between\nactual process results and that of predicted models are often\nout of a tolerable range. This leads to the demand of\nincreased simulation accuracy for the most crucial process\nsteps. The deviations of the comb structures in a resonator,\nwhich result from the tolerances in a Deep-RIE process, for\nexample, can make the overall system design fail. To avoid\nthese kinds of errors two things are needed: the technology\nprovider has to know the parameter range of his process and\nbe able to provide it to the designer without loosing his\nintellectual property. The designer in turn must be provided\nwith a way to use this information to design a system which\ncan perform in the range expected.\nII.\n\nDESIGN ENVIRONMENT BICEP3S\n\nThe design environment BICEP3S focuses on the\ndefinition of interfaces between single modules and acts as a\ncentral control and data management platform for different\nphases of microsystem design (figure 1). A central database\nmanagement system makes sure that all the relevant data,\nwhich is obtained during a product design process, is stored\nin a consistent way and can be accessed by different\ndesigners in a simultaneous engineering environment.\nEach module focuses on a specialized task in componentoriented design cycles. Special consideration was given to\nthe planning and optimization of consistent process flows for\nsystems, which consist of components that have been\ndeveloped using different technologies and are integrated\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-006-5\n\n\finto the same innovative microsystem. Once the system is\nsubdivided into functional elements the designer can search\nthe database of predefined components for previously\ndesigned parts which meet the functional criteria, as\ndescribed in [9]. Already existing components can be\nselected and their stored fabrication data as well as the\nparameterized layout data is used for the definition of the\nnew component. In other cases components might have to be\ndesigned in detail, whereby the layout and process design\nmodule will support the designer during this design state.\nWhen a 3D-model without detailed process features is\nsufficient, the layout and process data can be exported to\ncommercially available 3D modelers, e.g. SoftMEMS or\nCoventor Designer, where a model can be created for further\ncomputational analysis. If a more detailed view of the\nprocess result is needed for certain process steps, specialized\ntechnology simulator can be used. These process simulators\nare able to extract parameters from the definition of the\nprocess flow and are therefore directly linked to the process\ndesign module. If the simulation results are to be used for\nfurther computational analysis, there are converters available\nto ensure conversion between CAD or FEM tools and the\nsimulator. Such is the case for etch simulation results.\nIn some cases the mask design needs to be optimized. In\ntheses situations the design environment offers a powerful\n\n9-11 April 2008\nmodule for the optimization of lithographic masks. An\nevolutionary algorithm is used to create suitable layouts.\nThese layouts evolve over a certain number of generations\nstarting from a predefined set of masks and a 3D reference\nstructure. The process simulators are used for the assessment\nof each generated layout and a score is calculated from the\npredefined weights and degree of matching. To prevent the\nprocess from running into a local optimum, mutation is used\nto generate new individuals [10].\nFinally, the process planning module acts as an interface\nfor the collection and documentation of all relevant process\nresults during the fabrication process. For example, process\nengineers can store measurement protocols during the setup\nof the process. Such protocols are then used during inline\nmeasurements by the operator. This ensures full control over\nthe quality criteria for the executed fabrication steps.\nThe connection and communication between all single\nmodules is controlled by a workflow system. This system\nleads the engineers through different steps, which are\nassociated with the current design problem.\nAs the performance of a system is often dependent on the\nactual process result, focus will be given to the capabilities\nof process simulation in the next section of this paper. Wet\nchemical etching of silicon is still an important technology\nfor MEMS and the built in simulator along with its model\nand export functionality will be described in detail.\n\nFig. 1: The single modules of BICEP3S form a closed environment for MEMS design.\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-006-5\n\n\fIII.\n\nETCH SIMULATION SUZANA\n\nAs one example of the process simulation capabilities of\nBICEP3S, the etch simulator SUZANA is presented.\nSUZANA uses a cellular automaton model to simulate a\nwide range of three-dimensional geometries, including etchstop layers, double side etching and even locally disordered\ncrystal zones. The first version of this simulator was\ndeveloped from 1991 to 1994 [2]. In the past few years the\nmodel has been further enhanced and new features such as\ntolerance analysis of crucial parameters have been\nintroduced [1]. This has made SUZANA one of the most\naccurate and flexible tools in this area available today.\nHowever, as it considers only the etch rates of the most\nrelevant crystal planes, the simulation might not be as\naccurate in terms of predicting surface properties on very\nsmall features. A more accurate model which takes higher\nindexed planes into account was presented by Gos\u00e1lvez [11]\nand implemented into the VisualTAPAS [12] project. For\nmost design tasks the use of SUZANA is absolutely\nsufficient and benefits from its fast computation times and\naccuracy. Figure 2 demonstrates how a comb-like\ncompensation element is removed along the etch limiting\n(111) planes. The pictures on the right hand side show\nsimulation results after etching with KOH (30%) at 80 \u00b0C.\nThe pictures on the left hand side are SEM micrographs.\nThis example shows the high degree of matching between\nsimulation results and the etched structures.\n\n9-11 April 2008\nbased on the construction of Wulff-Jaccodine, the other is an\natomistically modeled etch process. The delimiting problem\nof the Wulff-Jaccodine algorithm is the occurrence of saddle\npoints whenever concave-convex shapes are mixed. Fr\u00fchauf\n[13] tries to overcome these problems by performing twodimensional calculations in a first step and calculating threedimensional sidewalls from the generated line structures.\nHowever, simulations for complex undercut geometries and\nprocesses involving etching from top and bottom sides are\nnot possible.\nSUZANA uses the atomistic approach which implements\na cellular automata based model of the etch process. Cellular\nautomata can be considered discrete structures which consist\nof a large number of simple cells. Such cells are ordered into\na grid, interact locally and can represent a certain number of\npredefined states (in this case etched or not etched). The\ninteraction of all cells is defined by rules. A rule can be\nregarded as a function, whose arguments are the states of the\ncell under consideration and of the neighboring cells. Its\nvalue is the new state of the considered cell. The application\nof the rules to a certain cell results in a change of its state.\nOne basic cell of the silicon crystal structure can be\ndescribed by two face-centered cubes, which are displaced\nby a quarter of the silicon lattice constant in each spatial\ndirection. This results in eight relevant atoms for the\ncomplete description of one cell. In Figure 3 these atoms are\ndepicted as darker and linked.\n\nFig. 3. The elementary cell of the silicon crystal can be modeled by 8\natoms.\n\nFig. 2. A comparison between simulation and experimental results\nshows the high accuracy of the algorithm.\n\nA.\n\nSimulation Model\n\nTwo different types of etch simulators have emerged\nduring the last few years. One uses the geometric model\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nThere are two models available. If a less detailed model is\nsufficient, one macro cell of the model is formed by the eight\ncorner points of one cubic cell (1-8). In this case each of the\ncorner atoms represents the eight atoms (5, b-h). If a more\ndetailed model is required a full set of atoms is defined, i.e.\none macro cell describes the atoms 5 and b to h. The second\nmodel ensures accurate results in multi step simulations and\nleads to a higher resolution in the z-direction.\nAs described above, the interaction of the cells is\ndescribed by rules. The next section will explain how rules\nmodel the behavior of the cells in the case of wet-chemical\netching of silicon.\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-006-5\n\n\fB.\n\nRules for Wet-Chemical Etching\n\nThe simulation uses discrete time steps to calculate the\npropagation of the etch front. For each step the algorithm\niterates over all cells on the surface of the model and\ncalculates the number of neighbors of the current cell. A\nDepending on the number of neighbors a decision is made as\nto whether a cell belongs to a certain crystal plane and the\netch probability is calculated accordingly. For the three main\nplanes the rules are as follows:\n(100)-plane: Atoms of this plane have two neighbors of\nfirst order (fig. 5 a) and are etched with a probability P100.\n\n9-11 April 2008\n(110)-plane: Atoms of this plane have 3 neighbors of first\norder and less than 9 neighbors of second order OR 9\nneighbors of second order and less then 3 neighbors of third\norder. They are etched with a probability P110.\n(111)-plane: Atoms of this plane have 3 neighbors of first\norder and a minimum of 10 neighbors of second order OR\nnine neighbors of second order and a minimum of 9\nneighbors of third order. They are etched with a probability\nP111.\nIf higher indexed planes have to be taken into account,\nappropriate rules have to be defined and etch probabilities\nmust be gained from experimental data. Simulation speed\ndecreases with an increasing number of rules.\nC.\n\nParameter and Layout Definition\n\nThe simulation process can be set-up in a graphical user\ninterface. Masks for top and bottom sides as well as etch\nstop areas can be imported from EDA/ CAD environments\nor can be created from scratch.\nThe process panel is used to define dimensions and\nresolution of the simulated area. Other specific parameters\nsuch as etch rates, substrate orientation or concentration and\ntemperature of the etchant can be specified or imported from\nthe central database.\nD.\n\nPost Processing of Simulation Results\n\nTo gain full advantage of the simulation results a link to\nCAD or FEM tools has been developed. The simulation\nresults are stored in discrete voxel file at the specified model\nresolution. A user defined number of etch states is saved\nwhich, if chosen, can be translated into a surface data model\nand displayed in a built-in 3-D viewer. Another important\nfeature, which speeds-up the design process, is the\nfunctionality of ACIS format export. For further use in FEM\nanalysis the detailed simulation results can be simplified. If,\nfor example, the surface topography of sidewalls is of less\nrelevance than the transmission between a membrane and a\nboss structure as depicted in figure 8, these details can be\nremoved. The ACIS file can be imported into most solid\nmodelers. In the example below, SolidWorks was used to\nimport the simulation result and CosmosWorks was utilized\nto simulate the mechanical behavior of the simulated\nstructure. Figure 5 gives an overview of the workflow for\nSUZANA to FEM export.\nIV.\n\nFig. 4. The number of cells in the neighborhood an atom (black) is\nused to determine whether an atom belongs to a (100)-plane (a),\n(110)-plane (b) or (111)-plane (c).\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nSUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVE\n\nA TCAD tool for MEMS, which combines process and\nlayout design and provides links to behavioral modeling\ntools as well as specialized modules for the optimized design\nof single components was presented.
