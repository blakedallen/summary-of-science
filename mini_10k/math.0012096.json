It follows that the moduli spaces of\nsymplectic forms modulo diffeomorphisms on the manifolds are disconnected.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper provides examples of symplectic manifolds with disconnected moduli\nspaces of symplectic forms. Recall that two symplectic forms \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u2032 on\na symplectic manifold X are deformation equivalent if there is some path of\nsymplectic forms interpolating between them. We allow the cohomology class\nto vary both along the path and at the endpoints. The forms \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u2032 are\ndiffeomorphism related if there is some diffeomorphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 X for which\n\u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2032 ; we do not insist that \u03c6 is isotopic to the identity. We write M(X)\nto denote the moduli space of symplectic forms on X up to diffeomorphism.\n(1.1) Definition: The forms \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u2032 are equivalent symplectic forms on X\nif they lie in the same equivalence class under the equivalence relation generated\nby deformations and diffeomorphisms.\nThus equivalence classes of symplectic form are indexed by \u03c00 (M(X)). This is\na suitable notion of equivalence for forms when we are interested in essentially\ntopological properties of the underlying symplectic manifolds. Note that even\ncoarse symplectic invariants of X, such as total volume, are not preserved by\nan equivalence of forms.\nIn dimensions 4k with k > 1 there are many examples of manifolds with inequivalent symplectic forms, which can be distinguished by the divisibility of\nthe first Chern class in integral cohomology. (In [8], using Gromov-Witten invariants, Yong-Bin Ruan gave sophisticated examples of inequivalent forms with the same Chern classes - on algebraic 3-folds; notice that he uses the term\n\"deformation equivalent\" for our \"equivalent\". Ruan also gave examples [7] of\ndiffeomorphisms of 3-folds which do intertwine Chern classes but which do not\n\n\f1 INTRODUCTION\n\n2\n\ninduce an equivalence of forms.) To see this, note that given homeomorphic\nfour-manifolds X and Y , the products X \u00d7 X = Y \u00d7 Y = Z are diffeomorphic. Suppose X is a minimal complex surface of general type with first Chern\nclass divisible by any odd n > 1, and Y is a non-minimal symplectic fourmanifold homeomorphic to X. (It is straightforward to construct such pairs\nusing Freedman's theorems.) The product symplectic form \u03c9X \u2295 \u03c9X on Z has\nodd c1 whereas the form \u03c9Y \u2295\u03c9Y has c1 prime. Taking additional products with\nfurther copies of the manifolds extends this to all higher dimensions 4k. However, in dimension four until recently no manifolds with inequivalent symplectic\nforms were known. This question was settled by McMullen and Taubes in [6],\nbut the forms were distinguished by gauge theory techniques specific to four\ndimensions. In this paper we provide four-dimensional examples on a similar\nfooting to the higher dimensional examples sketched above. Our main result is\nthe following\n(1.2) Theorem: For each n \u2265 2 there is a simply-connected manifold X 4\nwhich admits n distinct symplectic forms whose first Chern classes are of pairwise different divisibilities in H 2 (X; Z). In particular for such an X we have\n|\u03c00 (M(X))| \u2265 n.\nWe note that a recent result of Li and Liu [4] shows that on any symplectic fourmanifold, there are at most finitely many orbits of the diffeomorphism group\non the set of first Chern classes of symplectic structures. In some sense the\nabove result is therefore optimal1 . (In contrast to the work of Ruan mentioned\nabove, the existence of inequivalent symplectic forms not distinguished by the\nfirst Chern class remains open in four dimensions.) Theorem (1.2) perhaps casts\na new light, via taking products, on a conjecture of Donaldson (1.3 and 1.4).\nThe proof shall require only elementary arguments. Before giving more details,\nwe set the result in context.\n\u2022 Moduli spaces of symplectic forms: Following work of Taubes relating\nSeiberg-Witten invariants to pseudoholomorphic curves, there are a few symplectic four-manifolds for which the moduli space of symplectic forms is entirely\nunderstood. In all such cases, the understanding comes from a uniqueness theorem: for instance, every symplectic form on CP2 is standard up to scale and\ndiffeomorphism [11]. Lalonde and McDuff have proved similar results for other\nrational and ruled manifolds [3]. Moreover in four dimensions many symplectic invariants are largely determined by the smooth structure of the underlying\nmanifold, most famously for certain Gromov invariants counting pseudoholomorphic curves [11]. Recently McMullen and Taubes [6] gave the first examples\nof symplectic four-manifolds for which there are symplectic forms which are not\nequivalent to each other under any composition of deformations and pullbacks\nby diffeomorphisms. Their examples were distinguished by a classical invariant\n1 After\n\nthis paper was accepted, the author learned that independently Stefano Vidussi\n(Homotopy K3's with several symplectic structures) has used gauge theory methods to show\nthe existence, for any n, of homotopy K3 surfaces with n inequivalent symplectic structures.\n\n\f1 INTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nof a symplectic structure, the first Chern class, but via non-classical methods.\nFirst Chern classes of symplectic structures on manifolds with b+ > 1 are always\nSeiberg-Witten basic classes. Diffeomorphisms of a manifold preserve the set\nof basic classes inside Rb2 = H 2 (X; R); since diffeomorphisms act on this space\nlinearly, they preserve the polytope which is the convex hull of the basic classes.\nIt follows that they must preserve the sets of vertices of this polytope of any\nfixed valence; McMullen and Taubes find two symplectic structures on a fixed\nmanifold for which the first Chern classes represent vertices of distinct valence.\nDetecting the non-transitivity of diffeomorphisms on basic classes is of great\ninterest in its own right, but it is natural to hope that one might distinguish symplectic structures on simply connected manifolds using purely classical methods.\nWhen a manifold contains a Lagrangian torus of square zero which is homologically essential, there are perturbations of the symplectic form making the torus a\nsymplectic submanifold with either choice of orientation. This flexibility, which\nunderlies the McMullen-Taubes construction in different language, will enable\nus to give new and easy examples of simply connected four-manifolds for which\nthe moduli space of symplectic forms is disconnected. (Embedded surfaces of\nsquare zero were also used in [9] to give a topological construction of exotic\nsymplectic submanifolds on complex surfaces.)\n\u2022 Donaldson's Conjecture: According to ([5]; p.437) Simon Donaldson has\nformulated the following remarkable conjecture relating diffeomorphisms of symplectic four-manifolds to equivalences of symplectic six-manifolds. Write \u03c9st for\nthe standard K\u00e4hler form on projective space.\n(1.3) Conjecture: Let (X, \u03c9X ) and (Y, \u03c9Y ) be symplectic four-manifolds\nwhich are homeomorphic. Then they are diffeomorphic if and only if the product\nsymplectic forms \u03c9X \u2295 \u03c9st and \u03c9Y \u2295 \u03c9st are equivalent on X \u00d7 S2 \u223c\n=diff Y \u00d7 S2 .\nWe stress that we have nothing to say about this directly; however, it follows\nfrom our examples that the sphere S2 is playing a special role here which is not\nimmediately apparent from the formulation of (1.3). From (1.2) we see\n(1.4) Corollary: If in the statement of Donaldson's conjecture one replaces\nS2 by a symplectic manifold with c1 divisible by n > 2, then the analogous\nconjecture fails.\nHence we cannot replace S2 by the torus T2 or the K3 surface. A more vivid\nstatement is provided by the following contrast. Donaldson's conjecture would\nimply that the obvious symplectic structures on X\u00d7(P1 \u00d7P1 ) = Y \u00d7(P1 \u00d7P1 ) are\nequivalent, whereas (1.4) shows that if we replace P1 \u00d7 P1 with Sym2 (P1 ) \u223c\n= CP2\nthen this need not be true.\nThe heart of (1.2) is the following sufficient condition for a four-manifold to\nadmit inequivalent symplectic forms. Write E(1) for the rational elliptic surface\n[2].\n\n\f4\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\n(1.5) Theorem: Let X be a symplectic four-manifold such that\n1. there are square-zero tori T1 , . . . , Tr \u2282 X which span an r-dimensional\nsubspace in H2 (X; R), for some r > 1;\nP\n2. T1 is represented by a Lagrangian submanifold, Ti>1 and i Ti are represented by symplectic submanifolds (tori), all disjointly embedded;\n3. the first Chern class c1 (X) is divisible by n for some n > 2, whilst2 n 6| 2d\nwhere d is the divisibility of [T1 ] \u2208 H2 (X; Z).\nThen the manifold Z given by fibre summing X with a copy of E(1) along each\nof T1 , . . . , Tr and along (n\u22121) parallel copies of T1 +* * *+Tr admits inequivalent\nsymplectic structures.\nThe smooth structure on Z depends on a choice, once and for all, of trivialisations of the normal bundles of the tori. If \u03c01 (X) is normally generated by the\nimages of the \u03c01 (Ti ) then Z is simply connected. Here is an example. Let T4\ndescribe the usual Euclidean four-torus R4 /Z4 . With co-ordinates x, y, z, t on\nR4 there are two-tori in T4 which come from projecting the planes described by\nthe pairs of lines\nhx, ti; hy, ti; hz, ti; hx = y = z, ti.\nCall these respectively Tx , Ty , Tz , Tw . All the tori are oriented by taking the\nusual orientations on the defining lines in R4 (pointing out towards +\u221e). We\ncan perturb the tori to obtain five disjoint oriented tori inside T4 ; two parallel\ncopies of Tw and one of each of Tx , Ty , Tz . Let Z denote the simply connected\nsmooth four-manifold obtained by forming the normal fibre sum of T4 with five\ncopies of E(1), gluing a standard complex fibre F \u2282 E(1) to each of the five\ntori above.\n(1.6) Corollary: The simply-connected manifold Z admits two symplectic\nstructures which are not equivalent under any sequence of deformations or diffeomorphisms. Indeed there are symplectic structures \u03c91 and \u03c92 on Z for which\nc1 (T Z; \u03c91 ) is divisible by 3 in integral cohomology but c1 (T Z; \u03c92) is prime.\nSince the construction allows for some variation, infinitely many homeomorphism types of simply connected four-manifold displaying a similar phenomenon\ncan be obtained. To obtain a manifold with N inequivalent symplectic forms,\ntake n = p1 * * * pN to be a product of N distinct odd primes in (1.5). Then by\nvarying the number of fibre sums performed with the \"wrong\" orientation along\nthe Lagrangian torus, one can obtain symplectic forms on the final manifold\nZ for which the first Chern class is divisible by precisely one of the primes pi .\nThus (1.2) will be a direct consequence of the above results. We will address\n2 We\n\nuse the symbol a 6| b to show that a does not divide b.\n\n\f2 LAGRANGIAN FIBRE SUMS\n\n5\n\nthe proofs of (1.5 and 1.6) in the subsequent sections. Using these, and the\nremarks at the end of the paper, it is straightforward to deduce (1.4); we leave\nthe details to the reader.\nAcknowledgements: The McMullen-Taubes construction was cast in the light\npresented here during a lecture by Ron Fintushel, and I am grateful to him for\nhelpful correspondence. I am also indebted to Bob Gompf, who offered valuable\ncomments on an earlier draft of the paper.\n\n2\n\nLagrangian fibre sums\n\nThe fibre-sum construction for symplectic manifolds was pioneered by Gompf\nin [1] who used it to construct symplectic manifolds displaying many new phenomena. Gompf also noticed that given a homologically essential Lagrangian\nsubmanifold L of a symplectic four-manifold X, one could perturb the ambient symplectic form \u03c9 by an arbitrarily small amount so as to make the form\nnon-vanishing on L. In the presence of a fixed orientation on L, there is some\nchoice here; one can perturb \u03c9 to be either positive or negative on L. Recently\nthis construction, viewed from a somewhat different perspective, has been used\nby McMullen and Taubes to produce symplectic manifolds with inequivalent\nsymplectic forms. Their examples were distinguished using Seiberg-Witten theory, and the action of a diffeomorphism of a four-manifold on the convex hull\nof the Seiberg-Witten basic classes. Via the description in terms of fibre sums\nalong Lagrangians, one can obtain simpler examples of the same phenomena;\nwe present one class here. The author is very grateful to Ron Fintushel for a\nlucid explanation of the original work of McMullen and Taubes.\nWe begin with some more general remarks on the fibre sum operation in our\ncontext. Let (X, T ) and (Y, T \u2032 ) be symplectic pairs, where X, Y are symplectic\nfour-manifolds and T, T \u2032 are embedded tori of square zero on which the symplectic forms are non-degenerate. The symplectic structures define orientations\non all four manifolds, and hence orientations on the normal bundles of T in X\nand T \u2032 in Y . Then given any orientation-preserving diffeomorphism f of T and\nT \u2032 , we may lift to an orientation-reversing diffeomorphism of the normal bundles and use this to glue the manifolds X and Y along a neighbourhood of the\nembedded surfaces. Explicitly, choose a marking of T and T \u2032 with a standard\ntorus so the diffeomorphism f becomes the identity. Then we form\nX\u266f(T :T \u2032 ) Y = X\\\u03bdX T \u222a\u03c4 Y \\\u03bdY T \u2032\nwhere \u03c4 : T \u00d7 D2 \u2192 T \u2032 \u00d7 D2 is the map taking (t, z) 7\u2192 (t, z). Since complex\nconjugation reverses orientation on the disc and on its boundary circle, there is\na natural orientation induced on the final manifold. The diffeomorphism type of\nthe final manifold depends a priori on the diffeomorphism f and the choice of\nlift to an identification of the normal bundles. In our applications, the normal\nbundles of the tori will be canonically trivial. If in addition we suppose that\n\n\f2 LAGRANGIAN FIBRE SUMS\n\n6\n\n(Y, T \u2032 ) is an elliptic surface (E(1), F ) with an embedded complex fibre, then in\nfact all choices of f give orientation-preserving diffeomorphic manifolds. This\nis because of the standard\n(2.1) Lemma: Let E(1) denote the complex elliptic surface given by blowing\nup the nine base-points of a generic pencil of cubics in CP2 . Let F denote a\ngeneric smooth complex fibre of the resulting elliptic fibration. Then every orientation preserving diffeomorphism of \u03bdE(1) F may be extended to an orientation\npreserving diffeomorphism of E(1).\nNote importantly that in this case, the smooth structure on the fibre sum is\ndetermined completely by the orientation on T and by the trivialisations of the\nnormal bundles. The orientation of the torus in E(1) is not important since there\nare diffeomorphisms of the boundary of a neighbourhood of the fibre which are\norientation preserving but reverse the orientation on the fibre. Once all the\nchoices for the smooth structure on the sum are fixed, we can consider how to\npatch forms. That is, the symplectic structures themselves enter only in putting\na symplectic form on the sum.\nWe will make regular use of the following:\n(2.2) Proposition: Let W = X\u266f(T :T \u2032 ) Y denote the symplectic sum of manifolds X, Y along embedded symplectic tori of square zero. Then\nc1 (W ) = c1 (X) + c1 (Y ) \u2212 2P([T = T \u2032 ]).\nHere P(*) denotes the Poincar\u00e9 dual of a homology class (we will suppress this\nfrom the notation henceforth).\nProof: The notation needs explanation, since c1 (X) and c1 (Y ) are not naturally elements of H 2 (W ). One can make sense of them in various ways. Suppose\ninside X and Y we have embedded surfaces which are representatives for c1 disjoint from the tori T and T \u2032 . In this case these surfaces define homology classes\nin the manifold W and we take the Poincar\u00e9 duals of these. The tangent bundle\nto an oriented torus is (canonically) trivial, so the canonical bundles of X and Y\nare trivial over neighbourhoods of T and T \u2032 . Hence we can obtain the surfaces\n\u22121\nwe require by choosing smooth sections of KX\nand KY\u22121 which are constant\nand non-vanishing near T and T \u2032 .\nThere is apparently some choice. The trivialisations of the canonical bundles\nnear the tori depend on a choice of trivialisation of the normal bundles of the tori.\nFor our later examples there are natural choices: the fibre in an elliptic fibration\nhas a canonically trivial normal bundle, whilst any Lagrangian torus has a\ncanonically trivial normal bundle since a (connected) choice of almost complex\nstructure defines an isomorphism from the normal bundle to the tangent bundle.\nBeing more careful, recall that\n\n\f7\n\n2 LAGRANGIAN FIBRE SUMS\n\nH2 (X\\\u03bdX (T )) = H 2 (X\\\u03bdX (T ); \u2202);\none can see that a choice of trivialisation of the normal bundle to T defines a\nrelative Chern class in the group on the right. Moreover, we can use the given\ntrivialisation of \u03bdX (T ) and diffeomorphism T \u2192 T \u2032 to define one for \u03bdY (T \u2032 ),\nhence a second relative Chern class in H 2 (Y \\\u03bdY (T \u2032 ); \u2202). Perform the gluing\nrelative to these normal trivialisations; changing the trivialisation affects the two\nrelative Chern classes in cancelling fashion. Thus the final result is independent\nof choices.\nInterpreting the statement of the Proposition appropriately, a proof runs as\nfollows. We can choose smooth sections of the anticanonical bundles of each of\nX, Y which are non-vanishing over a neighbourhood of the gluing tori. Then\nthe final Chern class differs from the sum by a contribution from the normal\ndirections to the tori. The tangent bundles to X and Y split as a product\nhere, and the result follows from the usual formula for connect summing twodimensional surfaces:\ne(\u03a31 \u266f\u03a32 ) = e(\u03a31 ) + e(\u03a32 ) \u2212 2.\nEquivalently, the result follows since complex conjugation on the annulus has\nalgebraically two negatively oriented fixed points; compare to a favourite K\u00e4hler\nexample. \u0004\nNow suppose (X, T ) is a pair comprising a symplectic four-manifold and an oriented Lagrangian torus T , which we suppose is non-trivial in homology. Gompf\n[1] notes that we can perturb the symplectic form \u03c9X (by an arbitrarily small\namount, and in particular preserving the first Chern class of the symplectic\nstructure) to be non-degenerate on T . Fixing a pair of oriented tangent vectors\nv1 , v2 to T at a point p \u2208 T , we then have two possibilities: \u03c9X (v1 , v2 )p > 0\nor \u03c9X (v1 , v2 )p < 0. That is, the symplectic orientation induced on T can agree\nor disagree with the given fixed orientation. In the first case, we can form the\nsymplectic sum of (X, T ) with (E(1), F ) in the usual way, and we will find that\n(writing T+ to note the positivity)\nc1 (X\u266f(T+ :F ) E(1)) = c1 (X) + c1 (E(1); \u03c90 ) \u2212 2[T+ = F ]\n\n(2.3)\n\ncomparing with (2.2). Here \u03c90 denotes the usual K\u00e4hler form on the rational\nelliptic surface. However, for a perturbation of \u03c9X for which T is negatively\noriented, if we form the fibre sum of X along T with the given and not symplectic\norientation for the normal bundle \u03bdT /X , then we can only sum with a pair (Y, T \u2032 )\nfor which\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9\u0303X < 0\n\u03c9Y =\nT\u2032\n\nT\n\nwhere the  \u0303* denotes the perturbed form. Taking Y = E(1) and T \u2032 = F we\nfind that we can now form the symplectic sum if we take \u2212\u03c90 , the negative of\n\n\f8\n\n2 LAGRANGIAN FIBRE SUMS\n\nthe usual K\u00e4hler form, as the symplectic form on E(1). Then looking at Chern\nclasses we find\nc1 (X\u266f(T\u2212 :F ) E(1)) = c1 (X) + c1 (E(1); \u2212\u03c90 ) \u2212 2[\u2212T\u2212 = \u2212F ].\n\n(2.4)\n\nSince we are fibre summing along surfaces which have the reversed orientation\nto the usual symplectic setting (2.2), in the last term we reverse sign. The\nfollowing is standard:\n(2.5) Lemma: For the rational elliptic surface we have\nc1 (E(1); \u03c90 ) = [F ],\n\nc1 (E(1); \u2212\u03c90 ) = \u2212[F ]\n\nidentifying homology and cohomology via Poincar\u00e9 duality as usual.\nWith these various comments in place, the theorem (1.5) is straightforward.\n(2.6) Theorem: Suppose X is a symplectic manifold as in the statement of\n(1.5). Pick an orientation on T1 and form the oriented fibre sum of X with\nr + n \u2212 1 copies of E(1) as described. Then the resulting manifold Z admits\ninequivalent symplectic structures. Moreover it is simply connected if \u03c01 (X) is\nnormally generated by the images of the \u03c01 (Ti ).\nProof: We put two symplectic structures on Z, the first by perturbing T1\nto have the positive symplectic orientation and summing with (E(1), \u03c90 ) and\nthe second by perturbing in the other direction and summing with (E(1), \u2212\u03c90 ).\nFrom the above lemmata we find that the two symplectic structures on Z have\nChern classes\nc1 (Z)+ = c1 (X) \u2212 [T1 ] \u2212 [T2 ] \u2212 * * * \u2212 [Tr ] \u2212 (n \u2212 1)[T1 + * * * + Tr ]\nin the positive case, and\nc1 (Z)\u2212 = c1 (X) + [T1 ] \u2212 [T2 ] \u2212 * * * \u2212 [Tr ] \u2212 (n \u2212 1)[T1 + * * * + Tr ]\nin the negative case. Since n|c1P\n(X) clearly n|c1 (Z; \u03c9+ ); however, c1 (Z; \u03c9\u2212 ) =\nnA+ 2[T1 ] for A = (c1 (X)/n)\u2212 [Ti ]. Recalling that n 6| 2d for d the divisibility\nof [T1 ], the Chern class c1 (Z)\u2212 cannot be divisible by n, and the result follows.\nThe statement on fundamental groups is straightforward since \u03c01 (E(1)\\F ) = 0.\n\u0004\nIn the last section we provide some explicit examples. For simplicity, note that\nthe divisibility condition n 6| 2d will always hold if [T1 ] is prime in homology,\nwhilst n|c1 (X) is trivial for any n if c1 (X) = 0.\n\n\f3 INEQUIVALENT SYMPLECTIC FORMS\n\n3\n\n9\n\nInequivalent symplectic forms\n\nWe develop the examples described in (1.6). The reader may wish to compare to\nthe original construction of McMullen and Taubes from [6]. Take co-ordinates\nx, y, z, t on R4 and write T4 = R4 /Z4 . Define the oriented tori Tx , Ty , Tz and\nTw as follows:\nTx = hx, ti; Ty = hy, ti; Tz = hz, ti; Tw = hx = y = z, ti.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThese tori are oriented as follows. View T4 as T3 \u00d7 S1 and view the tori as\ngiven by taking products of circles in T3 with the last factor. The circles are\nprojections of lines in R3 which are all disjoint and are parallel to the x, y, z axes\nand to the line x = y = z respectively. Orient these lines by arrows pointing to\nthe positive infinity, and orient the circle S1(t) ; this orients the tori. We choose\nthe lines in R3 parallel to the obvious axes so that all the tori are disjoint.\n(3.2) Lemma: There is a relation [Tw ] = [Tx + Ty + Tz ] in H2 (T4 ; Z).\nProof: This is straightforward from the given presentation. We recall for\nthe reader's convenience, however, the way this comes about via the original\nconstruction. From [6]: View T3 as surgery on the Borromean rings B in R3 .\nThe circles Cx , Cy , Cz in T3 for which C\u2022 \u00d7 S1 = T\u2022 are the images of meridians\nto the three zero-framed components of the link B. On the other hand, the circle\nCw is the image of an axis to the link in R3 , that is a line linking each component\nof the rings precisely once. The meridians Cx , Cy , Cz generate H1 (T3 ; Z) and\nthe co-ordinates of any loop \u03b3 in H1 with respect to this basis are given by the\nlinking numbers, which yields the formula claimed. \u0004\nFrom this construction, or directly, we can take two parallel and unlinked copies\nof the axis in R3 and obtain two parallel copies of the torus Tw \u2282 T4 each of\nwhich satisfies this homology relation. For the standard symplectic structure on\nT4 induced from dx\u2227dt+dy \u2227dz on R4 , the tori Tx and Tw are symplectic whilst\nthe tori Ty , Tz are Lagrangian (but canonically oriented by the orientations on\nthe axes in R3 ). By the remark after (2.1), there is a uniquely defined oriented\nsmooth four-manifold Z given by forming the fibre sum of T4 with five copies\nof E(1). Here we glue a neighbourhood of a complex oriented fibre F \u2282 E(1) to\nthe oriented tori Tx , Ty , Tz and to two parallel copies of Tw . Note that all the\ntori have canonically trivial normal bundles, and this fixes the indeterminacy in\nthe fibre sum. Because \u03c01 (T4 ) is generated by the images of the fundamental\ngroups \u03c01 (T\u2022 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (T4 ), and because \u03c01 (E(1)\\F ) is trivial (contract any loop\nalong a cusp fibre, which is a rational curve), it follows easily that Z is simply\nconnected. Note that the McMullen-Taubes manifold of [6] is exactly the smooth\nfibre sum of T4 along the four oriented tori Tx , Ty , Tz and one copy of Tw . Using\nour remarks on Chern classes, we have the following proposition, from which\nthe theorem (1.6) clearly follows.\n\n\f10\n\nREFERENCES\n\n(3.3) Proposition: The homology classes \u22123[Tx +Ty +Tz ] and \u22123[Tx +Ty ]\u2212Tz\nare each the first Chern class of a symplectic structure on Z.\nProof: There is a symplectic structure \u03c9+ on T4 for which all four tori are\nsymplectic submanifolds with the symplectic orientation and given orientations\nagreeing. Form the symplectic fibre sums with respect to such a form, inducing\na form \u03a9+ on Z. Then we find by (2.3) that c1 (Z; \u03a9+ ) is given by\n5\nX\n\nc1 (T4 ; \u03c9+ ) + [Fx + Fy + Fz + Fw + Fw ]\n\ni=1\n\n\u22122[Fx = Tx ] \u2212 2[Fy = Ty ] \u2212 2[Fz = Tz ] \u2212 2[Fw = Tw ] \u2212 2[Fw = Tw ],\nwhere we write F\u2022 for the homology class of the fibre in the \u2022-th copy of E(1)\nfor clarity. However, we can also choose a form \u03c9\u2212 on T4 for which Tx , Ty\nand Tw are symplectic with the given orientation but for which \u03c9\u2212 restricts\non Tz to a form which is symplectic with the negative orientation. Now use\n(2.4) to compute the Chern class of the symplectic form \u03a9\u2212 induced on Z after\nperforming the new symplectic sum (which is smoothly identical to the old).\nRecall from (2.5) that the sign of the first Chern class of E(1) changes if we\nchange the sign of the symplectic form: then c1 (Z; \u03a9\u2212 ) is now given by\n5\nX\n\nc1 (T4 ; \u03c9\u2212 ) + [Fx + Fy \u2212 Fz + Fw + Fw ]\n\ni=1\n\n\u22122[Fx = Tx ] \u2212 2[Fy = Ty ] + 2[Fz = Tz ] \u2212 2[Fw = Tw ] \u2212 2[Fw = Tw ].\nNow recall that for both \u03c9\u00b1 the first Chern class of T4 vanishes, since these\nare perturbations of the standard form; then expanding out and using (3.2) the\nproposition follows. \u0004\nOne can fibre sum with further parallel copies of Tw to obtain a sequence of\n(pairwise non-homeomorphic) simply connected manifolds with pairs of symplectic structures, precisely one of which has c1 divisible by n, for any n > 2. If\nn = p1 * * * pN is a product of primes and we perform pi of the fibre sums with\nthe negatively oriented Lagrangian torus, we obtain a symplectic structure with\nfirst Chern class divisible by pi but not any other pj6=i . This gives the main\ntheorem (1.2). For more variation, replace the four-torus with some twisted\ntorus bundle over the torus which has a symplectic structure with vanishing\nfirst Chern class. Infinite families of such examples are described in [10].\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
