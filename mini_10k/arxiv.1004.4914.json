INTRODUCTION\nSecret sharing was invented independently by G.R. Blakley and Adi Shamir [2, 12]. It was\ngeneralized to visual cryptography by Moni Naor and Adi Shamir [1]. The basic model for visual\nsharing of the k out of n secret image is such that;\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nAny n participants can compute the original message if any k (or more) of them are\nstacked together.\nNo group of k-1 (or fewer) participants cannot compute the original message.\n\nImages are split into two or more shares such that when a predetermined number of shares are\naligned and stacked together, then the secret image is revealed [1, 3] without any computation.\n\nRecursive hiding of secrets is proposed in [4, 5, 16-18]. The idea involved is recursive hiding of\nsmaller secrets in shares of larger secrets with secret sizes increasing at every step. While the\nscheme presented in [4] is a non-threshold scheme, schemes in [5, 16-19] are threshold schemes.\nIn [16], a tree data structure is used for recursive encoding of text such that the internal nodes of\nthe tree also carry information in addition to leaves of the tree. Repeated application of Shamir\u201fs\nscheme is used in [17] to share k-1 secrets in n shares. However, the general threshold recursive\nschemes in [16-19] are not visual cryptography schemes. The scheme in [5], although a recursive\nvisual cryptography scheme, is restricted to 2-out-of-n scheme. In this article, we take a step\nfurther and present a 3-out-of-5 recursive scheme for visual secret sharing.\n\nFurther this idea can be generalized to a 3 out of \u201en\u201f threshold scheme. We consider only\nmonochrome images, and each pixel (or sub-pixel) is considered to be one bit of information.\n\n\fRecursive Information Hiding in Visual Cryptography | 2010\n\n2.

RECURSIVE INFORMATION HIDING IN 3 OUT OF 5 SCHEME\n\nRecursive information hiding is a technique where certain additional secret information can be\nhidden in one of the shares of the original secret image [4]. Here the secret information which we\nare going to hide is taken according to their sizes i.e. small images to larger. The first small\nsecret image is divided into five different shares using visual cryptography. These shares are\nplaced in the next level to create the shares of larger secret information. We are distributing the\nshares at each consecutive level so that no one has access to all the shares of the smaller images,\nunless until at least three participants come together to reveal the secret information, resulting in\n3 out of 5 scheme.\n\nFigure 3, is an example to help readers to understand the concept visually. The original secret\nimage under consideration is of size 5 \u00d7 5 and the first secret image is of size 1 \u00d7 1. There are\ntotally five shares obtained for the first secret image based on the basic idea of visual\ncryptography. The second secret image is of size 5 \u00d7 1. To obtain the second secret image we are\ngoing to use the shares of first secret image and they are placed in different levels (level 1-5) one\nafter the other in five different shares. Now the shares of second secret image are designed by\nseeing the shares of first secret image and the original second secret image.\n\nFrom Figure 3, we can see share 2 of the first secret image is placed on share 2 of the second\nsecret image (level 2), and this share is a part of complete black pixel. The original second secret\nimage has a complete white pixel under level 2, so we need to design all the shares of level 2 of\nsecond secret image by comparing both the shares of first secret image and the original second\nsecret image to get a partial white pixel when we combine all the 5 shares or at least 3 shares in\nour case. This process is recursively repeated for all the shares. By doing this we can obtain the\ninformation of original second secret image by combining any 3 shares. This is the process for\nrecursive information hiding of images. From Figure 1 we can see that the partitions of white\npixel are stacked upon each other three fifth of the pixel is white and hence appears light gray to\nhuman eye. However, the subpixels of the black pixel are not complete black when 3 shares are\nstacked together but it is completely black when all the 5 shares are stacked.\n\nFigure 4 shows an illustration of recursive information hiding. The original secret image\nconsidered is the Lena image of size 380 \u00d7 390. The first secret image is stick figure of size 78\n\u00d7 78 and the second secret image is a text of size 380 \u00d7 78 and these both are hidden\nrecursively.\n\n6\n\n\fRecursive Information Hiding in Visual Cryptography | 2010\n\nOriginal Secret Image\n\nSecond\nSecret Image\n\nOriginal Secret\nImage\n\nFirst Secret\nImage\n\nShare1\n\nShare 1\n\nShare1\n\nShare2\n\nShare2\n\nShare2\n\nShare3\n\nShare4\n\nShare3\n\nShare4\n\nShare3\n\nShare4\n\nShare5\n\nShare5\n\nShare5\n\nOriginal Secret Image Shares\n\nFigure 3.

A GENERAL \"k\" out of \"n\" SCHEME\n\nA general k out of n scheme is designed from k out of k scheme. Let C be k out of k visual secret\nsharing scheme with parameters m, r, \u03b1. The scheme C consists of two collections of k \u00d7 m\nBoolean matrices and C0 = T10 , T20 , . . . . Tr0 and C1 = T11 , T21 , . . . . Tr1 . H is a collection of l\nfunctions \u2200h \u2208 H, h \u2236 1 ... . n \u2192 {1 ... . k}. Let B be the subset of 1 ... . n of size k and \u03b2q is\nprobability that randomly chosen function h \u2208 H yields q different values on B, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 k.\nWe construct from C and H a k out of n scheme C | with parameters m| = m . l, \u03b1 | \u2265 \u03b2k \u03b1, r | = r l\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nThe ground set is V = U \u00d7 H\nEach 1 \u2264 t \u2264 r l is indexed by a vector (t1 , t2 , ... . tl ) where each 1 \u2264 t \u2264 r.\nThe matrix Stb for t = (t1 , t2 , ... . tl ) where b \u2208 {0, 1} is defined as\nStb i, j, h\n\n= Ttjb [h i , j]\n\nContrast\nContrast should be \u2265 \u03b2k \u03b1\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nk rows is Stb , mapped to q < k different values by h\nHamming weight of OR of q rows is f(q)\nDifference is \u03b1m white and black pixels occurs when h is one and happens at \u03b2k\nWHITE: H v \u2264 l(\u03b2k d \u2212 \u03b1m + k\u22121\nq=1 \u03b2q . f(q))\nk\u22121\nBLACK: H v \u2265 l(\u03b2k + q=1 \u03b2q . f(q))\n11\n\n\fRecursive Information Hiding in Visual Cryptography | 2010\n\nSecurity\nSecurity properties of the \"k out of k\" scheme imply the security of \"k out of n\" scheme because\nwe are using (k,k) scheme to create (k,n) scheme.

CONCLUSION\n\nRecursive information hiding in visual cryptography can be applied to many applications in real\nand cyber world. The advantage is that the final decryption process is done by human visual\nsystem instead of complex computations. In this article we have presented a 3 out of 5 recursive\nhiding scheme that can be extended to a k out of n scheme.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Naor, M. and Shamir, A. 1995. Visual Cryptography.
