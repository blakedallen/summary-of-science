These theories\nrely mainly on a modification of the canonical commutation relations between the position\nand momentum operators. We will consider in this paper a particular case of such a modification, which has been previously obtained in the context of perturbative string theory (see\nfor example Ref. [2]). As an illustration, in one dimension, and in units such as h\u0304 = c = 1,\nit reads\nh\ni\nX\u0302, P\u0302 = i(1 + \u03b2 P\u0302 2 ).\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b2 is a small parameter, assumed to be positive. If \u03b2 = 0, Eq. (1) clearly reduces to the\nordinary Heisenberg algebra. Such a commutation relation leads to the following uncertainty\nrelation\n1\n\u2206X\u0302 \u2265\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\n+ \u03b2\u2206P\u0302\n\u2206P\u0302\nwhich implies the existence of a minimal length [7]\n\u2206x0 =\n\np\n\u03b2.\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThis particular modification of the Heisenberg algebra, and its extension to higher dimensions, has been extensively studied recently, see for example Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,\n14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\nRemark that it has also been argued that such a deformed Heisenberg algebra could also\nbe used to describe, as an effective theory, non-pointlike particles: Hadrons, quasi-particles,\ncollective excitations,. . . [21].\nA recent experiment, called GRANIT, is devoted to the study of quantum states of\nneutrons in the Earth's gravitational field. Roughly speaking, in this experiment, ultra cold\nneutrons are freely moving in the gravitational field above a mirror. This particular setup\ngives rise to a so-called gravitational quantum well. As a consequence, the energy spectrum\nof the neutrons in the gravitational field's direction is quantized, and the probability of\nobserving a particle at a given height will be maximum at the classical turning point hn =\nEn /mg, for each energy En . That is indeed what is observed. More details can be found in\nRefs. [22, 23, 24]. This experiment gives an opportunity to make a confrontation between\n2\n\n\fobservation and various theoretical models concerning quantum effects in gravity, including\neventual signatures of the existence of an intrinsic minimal length.\nA first study of the gravitational quantum well in a noncommutative geometry has been\nperformed in Ref. [25]. It was based on the two dimensional commutation relations\n[x1 , x2 ] = i\u03b8, [p1 , p2 ] = i\u03b7, [xj , pk ] = i\u03b4jk ,\n\n(4)\n\nand upper bounds on the parameters \u03b8, \u03b7 have been obtained by comparison with the\nexperimental results of Ref. [24]. Let us note that Eqs. (4) lead to the following uncertainty\nrelations\n|\u03b8|\n|\u03b7|\n1\n, \u2206p1 \u2206p2 \u2265\n, \u2206xj \u2206pj \u2265 ,\n(5)\n2\n2\n2\nalso suggesting the existence of a minimal length accessible by measurement. A discussion\n\u2206x1 \u2206x2 \u2265\n\nabout the distinctions and links between the minimal length uncertainty relation (2) and\nspace uncertainty relations of the form (5) can be found in Ref. [26].\nOur goal is to study the deviations from the usual gravitational quantum well caused by\na two dimensional analog of the modified Heisenberg algebra (1), instead of the relations (4)\nalready used in Ref. [25]. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with a deformed Heisenberg algebra following Ref. [27]. We particularize it to the case of the gravitational quantum well, and obtain an analytic form for the\nenergy spectrum in perturbation in Sec. III. Then, we discuss the comparison between our\nresults, those of Ref. [25], and those of GRANIT in Sec. IV. Finally, our conclusions are\ngiven in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MAIN EQUATION FOR A GENERAL POTENTIAL\n\nThe method we use is essentially the same than the one developed in Ref. [27]. Nevertheless we recall in this section the main lines to make the paper self-contained. The modified\nHeisenberg algebra studied here is defined in d dimensions by the following commutation\nrelations [9, 21]\nh\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\u0302i , P\u0302j = i \u03b4ij + \u03b2\u03b4ij P\u0302 2 + \u03b2 \u2032 P\u0302i P\u0302j ,\nh\ni\nP\u0302i , P\u0302j = 0,\nh\ni\n(2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032) + (2\u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2032 )\u03b2 P\u0302 2\nP\u0302[i X\u0302 j] ,\nX\u0302i , X\u0302j = i\n(1 + \u03b2 P\u0302 2 )\n3\n\n(6a)\n(6b)\n(6c)\n\n\fwhere P\u0302 2 =\n\nPd\n\ni=1\n\nP\u0302i P\u0302i and where \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 > 0 are considered as small quantities of the first\n\norder. Let us note that P\u0302[i X\u0302 j] = P\u0302i X\u0302j \u2212 P\u0302j X\u0302i . In this paper, we only study the case\n\u03b2 \u2032 = 2\u03b2, which leaves the commutation relations between the operators X\u0302i unchanged at\nthe first order in \u03b2, i.e.\nh\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\u0302i , P\u0302j = i \u03b4ij + \u03b2\u03b4ij P\u0302 2 + 2\u03b2 P\u0302i P\u0302j ,\nh\ni\nh\ni\nP\u0302i , P\u0302j = 0 \u2248 X\u0302i , X\u0302j .\n\n(7a)\n(7b)\n\nThe commutation relations (7) constitute the minimal extension of the Heisenberg algebra\nand are thus of special interest. In this case, the minimal length is given by [21]\n\u2206x0 =\n\np\n\n(d + 2)\u03b2.\n\n(8)\n\nTo calculate a spectrum for a given potential, we must find a representation of the operators X\u0302i and P\u0302i , involving position variables xi and partial derivatives with respect to these\nposition variables, which satisfies Eqs. (7), and then solve the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation:\n\"\n\n#\n\u0010 \u0011\nP\u0302 2\n~\n+ V X\u0302\n\u03a8(~x ) = E \u03a8(~x ).\n2m\n\n(9)\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that the following representation fulfills the relations (7), at\nthe first order in \u03b2,\nX\u0302i \u03a8(~x ) = xi \u03a8(~x ),\n\u0001\nP\u0302i \u03a8(~x ) = pi 1 + \u03b2~p 2 \u03a8(~x ),\n\n(10)\n\nwith pi = \u2212i \u2202/\u2202xi . Neglecting terms of order \u03b2 2 , the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (9) takes the\nform\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\np~ 2\n\u03b2 4\n+ ~p + V (~x ) \u03a8(~x ) = E \u03a8(~x ).\n2m m\n\n(11)\n\nThis is the main equation from which the influence of a non vanishing \u03b2 can be studied. It\nalso allows to compute upper bounds on this deformation parameter by comparison with\nexperimental results. This equation is just the ordinary Schr\u00f6dinger equation with an additional term proportional to p~ 4 . As this correction is assumed to be small, we will compute\nits effects on the energy spectrum at the first order in perturbation.\n\n4\n\n\fIII.\n\nTHE MAIN EQUATION FOR A GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM WELL\n\nLet us now consider the case of a particle of mass m, moving in a zy plane, and subject\nto the Earth's gravitational field: ~g = \u2212g ~ez , where g = 9.80665 m s\u22122 . In order to form a\ngravitational quantum well, a mirror is placed at z = 0 and acts as an hardcore interaction.\nThis corresponds to the experimental setup described in Refs. [22, 23, 24]. It is reasonable to\nkeep a constant value for g because of the small size of the experiment. Taking into account\nthe variation of the gravitational field would only introduce higher order corrections that\ncan be neglected in this first order calculation. For the same reason, corrections coming from\nthe fact that the mirror is not a perfect hardcore will not be included here. The potential\nwhich enters in Eq. (11) is then V (~x ) = V (z) with\nV (z) = +\u221e for z \u2264 0\n= mgz\n\nfor z > 0.\n\n(12)\n\nAn infinite potential in z = 0 is a very good description of the mirror, at least for the lowest\neigenstates.\n\nA.\n\nThe case \u03b2 = 0\n\nThe solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in this context for \u03b2 = 0 is well known [28, p.\n101]. We write\n\u03a8(~x ) = \u03c8n (z)\u03c8(y).\n\n(13)\n\nThe wave function along the z axis then reads\n\u03c8n (z) = An Ai(z\u0304),\n\nwith z\u0304 = \u03b3z + \u03b1n\n\nand \u03b3 = (2m2 g)1/3 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the function Ai(z\u0304) is the normalizable Airy function and where \u03b1n are the zeros of\nthis function. Their values can be found for example in Ref. [29, p. 478]. The normalization\nfactor An is given by\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\u0014 Z +\u221e\n\u03b3 1/2\n1\n2\ndz\u0304 Ai (z\u0304)\n=\n,\nAn =\n\u03b3 \u03b1n\n|Ai\u2032 (\u03b1n )|\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Ai\u2032 (x) is the derivative of the Airy function. The eigenvalues are related to the zeros\nof the Airy function as follows\nEn0 = \u2212\n5\n\nmg\n\u03b1n ,\n\u03b3\n\n(16)\n\n\fand consequently, the most probable heights where a particle can be detected are given by\nh0n = \u2212\n\n\u03b1n\n.\n\u03b3\n\nAlong the y axis, the particle is free and the wave function takes the form\nZ +\u221e\n\u03c8(y) =\ndk g(k) eiky ,\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere g(k) determines the shape of the wave packet in momentum space.\n\nB.\n\nThe case \u03b2 > 0\n\nAs En0 denotes the eigenvalues for \u03b2 = 0, the energy spectrum to the first order in the\ndeformation parameter \u03b2 is given by\nEn = En0 + \u2206En .\n\n(19)\n\nIt can be seen from Eq. (11) that the correction to the energy \u2206En at the first order in \u03b2\nreads\n\u03b2\nh\u03a8(~x )|~p 4 |\u03a8(~x )i,\nm\n\u0003\n\u03b2 \u0002\nh\u03c8n (z)|p4z |\u03c8n (z)i + 2h\u03c8n (z)|p2z |\u03c8n (z)ih\u03c8(y)|p2y |\u03c8(y)i ,\n=\nm\n\n\u2206En =\n\n(20)\n\nwhere a term proportional to h\u03c8(y)|p4y |\u03c8(y)i has been omitted since it only leads to a global\nshift of the energy spectrum and has thus no interest. This last relation can be written as\n\u0003\n\u03b2 \u0002 2\n4m h(En0 \u2212 V (z))2 i + 8m2 Ec hEn0 \u2212 V (z)i ,\nm\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= 4\u03b2m En0 (En0 + 2Ec ) \u2212 2(En0 + Ec )hV (z)i + hV (z)2 i ,\n\n\u2206En =\n\n(21)\n\nwhere Ec = mh\u03c8(y)|vy2|\u03c8(y)i/2 is the kinetic energy of the particle along the y axis. The\naverages appearing in Eq. (21) are obviously computed with \u03c8n (z).

The last\nterm in the parenthesis of this formula is much larger than 1 (about 6 order of magnitude\nlarger): En0 has a value around few peV on Earth (see Eqs. (16) and (31)), and even for the\nnonrelativistic neutrons of Ref. [24], the kinetic energy is around 100 neV. More precisely,\nthe neutrons mean horizontal velocity was measured to be around 6.5 m s\u22121 [24]. So, the\nkinetic energy is roughly equal to Ec \u2243 mhvy i2 /2 \u2243 0.221 \u03bceV (taking for the neutron mass\nthe experimental value m = 939.57 MeV [30]). Clearly, we can thus use in a very good\napproximation\n8\n\u2206En \u223c\n(26)\n= m\u03b2Ec En0 .\n3\nThis result can be compared to the energy shifts obtained with the noncommutative geometry (4). To the first order in the small parameters \u03b8, \u03b7, it is shown in Ref. [25] that these\nshifts, denoted \u2206\u1ebcn , are given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03b7hvy i \u22122 2 +\u221e\n\u03b1n\n2\n\u2206\u1ebcn =\nds s Ai (s) \u2212\n\u03b3 An\n.\n2\n\u03b3\n\u03b1n\n\n(27)\n\nThe integral appearing in Eq. (27) can be analytically computed and we obtain\n\u2206\u1ebcn =\n\n\u03b7hvy i 0\nE .\n3mg n\n\n(28)\n\nA nonzero parameter \u03b2 leads, independently of its actual value, to a larger value for\nthe heights since hn = h0n + \u2206hn , with \u2206hn = \u2206En /mg and \u2206En given by Eq. (26). We\nrecall indeed that \u03b2 was assumed to be positive. The signature of the modified Heisenberg\nalgebra (7) would then be \u2206hn > 0 and\n\u2206hn \u221d hvy i\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n3\u03c0\n(n \u2212 1/4)\n2\n\n7\n\n\u00152/3\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\n\fthe second factor being a WKB approximation of the zeros of the Airy function [29, p. 450].\nThis effect is different of the one predicted by the relation (28), since in this case we should\nobserve\n\u0014\n\n3\u03c0\n\u2206h\u0303n \u221d \u00b1hvy i\n(n \u2212 1/4)\n2\n\n\u00152/3\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nThe \u00b1 factor in Eq. (30) arises from the fact that the sign of \u03b7 is a priori unspecified. So,\nif \u03b7 < 0, noncommutative geometry could cause a decrease of the heights instead of the\nincrease predicted by our deformed algebra. Even if we suppose that \u03b7 > 0, the heights\nshifts (29) and (30) can be distinguished in principle since their dependence on hvy i is\ndifferent. Another important difference between \u2206hn and \u2206h\u0303n concerns their dependence\non the mass of the particle: \u2206hn \u221d m4/3 whereas \u2206h\u0303n \u221d m\u22125/3 .\n\nB.\n\nComparison with GRANIT experiment\n\nWe turn now our attention to the comparison between formula (26) and GRANIT results.\nFollowing Eqs. (16) and (17), the theoretical energies and heights for the two first eigenstates\nare\nE10 = 1.407 peV,\n\nE20 = 2.461 peV,\n\nh01 = 13.7 \u03bcm,\n\nh02 = 24.0 \u03bcm.\n\n(31)\n\nThe experimental results concerning these states are [24]\nhexp\n= 12.2 \u03bcm \u00b1 1.8syst \u00b1 0.7stat ,\n1\nhexp\n= 21.6 \u03bcm \u00b1 2.2syst \u00b1 0.7stat .\n2\n\n(32)\n\nThe theoretical values are contained in the error bars. The energy shifts due to eventual\nnew physical mechanisms are thus bounded. They can not exceed\n\u2206E1exp = 0.102 peV,\n\u2206E2exp = 0.051 peV,\n\n(33)\n\nsince \u2206En has been shown to be positive, see Eq. (26). Consequently, we have to satisfy the\nconstraint\n\u2206En < \u2206Enexp ,\n8\n\n(34)\n\n\fwith \u2206En given by Eq. (26). Let us discuss the possible values of \u03b2. There are two possibilities, following the status of this parameter.\nThe first possibility is that \u03b2 could be a new universal constant, or a function of the\nalready known constants. Then, its value could be equally measured by independent experiments and a unique value, within error bars, would be found. It was shown in Ref. [27] how\nthe spectrum of the hydrogen atom would be affected by the deformed Heisenberg algebra\nwe use, and an upper bound \u2206x0 < 10\u22122 fm was derived, or equivalently \u03b2 < 2 10\u22125 fm2\n\u2243 5 10\u221222 eV\u22122 . This estimation was based on a very precise (up to 1kHz) measurement\nof the radiation emitted during the transition 1S-2S of the hydrogen atom [31]. With this\nupper bound, it is readily computed that\n< 10\u221219 peV.\n\u2206E1 \u2243 \u2206E2 \u223c\n\n(35)\n\nIf \u03b2 is a universal constant, the upper bounds (35) tell us that the effects of the existence\nof a minimal observable length are largely unobservable in the GRANIT experiment, since\nthe maximal precision is 10\u22122 peV [24].\nThe second possibility is that \u03b2 could vary from one system to another depending for\nexample on the energetic content of the system (mass of the particles, strength of the interactions,. . . ). If \u03b2 is such a quantity, the upper bound of Ref. [27] is no longer relevant for\nour study of neutrons in a gravitational quantum well (the mass of the particle and the interaction are different), and a new upper bound has to be determined from the experimental\nresults. Equation (26), together with the relation (8) for d = 2 leads to\ns\n3\u2206Enexp\n.\n\u2206x0 < 2\n8mEn0 Ec\n\n(36)\n\nFor n = 2 we find \u2206x0 < 0.012 eV\u22121 = 2.41 nm, or \u03b2 < 1.46 nm2 . The case n = 1 does\nnot lead to a better upper bound. This new upper bound for \u03b2 could be used to restrict the\npossible choices for an explicit expression of this parameter, in a similar way as the upper\nbound found in Ref. [27] was used in Ref. [32] to show that \u03b2 could not be identified to the\nCompton length of the particle as proposed in Ref. [33]: The effects of a minimal length\n\u2206x0 on the energy spectrum would then be too large in the case of the hydrogen atom.\nAt last, remark that if \u2206x0 is related to the size of the particle, as suggested in Ref. [21],\n< 10\u221215 peV, since\nand discussed in the case of an electron in Ref. [27], then \u2206E1 \u2243 \u2206E2 \u223c\nthe size of the neutron is around 1 fm.\n9\n\n\fV.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE RESULTS\n\nWe have found in perturbation the energy spectrum of a gravitational quantum well with\na one-parameter deformed Heisenberg algebra. This deformation implies in particular the\nexistence of a minimal observable length, which is a feature it shares with usual noncommutative theories. We found that the energy shifts caused by this deformed algebra are\npositive with a linear dependence on the kinetic energy of the particles. This signature is\ndifferent from the one coming from a previously studied noncommutative geometry [25]. In\nthis case indeed, the energy shifts can be either positive or negative, following the sign of\nthe noncommutativity parameter, and they depend on the square root of the kinetic energy. The gravitational quantum well thus appears as an interesting physical system which\nallows, at least in principle, to distinguish between several approaches predicting different\nmodifications of the Heisenberg algebra.\nBy particularizing our results to the case of a neutron in the Earth's gravitational field, we\nare able to compare them to those of the GRANIT experiment. Our conclusion is twofold,\nfollowing the status of the deformation parameter \u03b2. If \u03b2 is a universal constant, we can use\nan upper bound obtained previously by analysis of the hydrogen atom spectrum [27], and\nwe find that the energy shifts due to a nonzero value of \u03b2 are around 10\u221219 peV. This is far\nbeyond the experimental precision. However, if \u03b2 is a quantity that depends on the energetic\ncontent of the system (like the mass of the particle), we can derive a new upper bound from\nthe GRANIT results. We conclude in that case that the minimal length scale associated to\nneutrons moving in a gravitational quantum well is smaller than few nanometers. This new\nupper bound could be used to constrain possible choices for an explicit expression of \u03b2.\n\n[1] D. J. Gross and P. F. Mende, Nucl. Phys. B 303, 407 (1988).\n[2] D. Amati, M.
