The stability of the r-modes against gravitational radiation reaction is also\nexamined considering viscous dissipation due to shear and a damping mechanism called mutual\nfriction between the superfluids in the core. We find the r-modes in the superfluid core are split\ninto ordinary r-modes and superfluid r-modes, which we call, respectively, ro - and rs -modes.\nThe two superfluids in the core flow together for the ro -modes, while they counter-move for\nthe rs -modes. For the ro -modes, the coefficient \u03ba0 \u2261 lim\u03a9\u21920 \u03c9/\u03a9 is equal to 2m/[l\u2032(l\u2032 + 1)],\nalmost independent of the parameter \u03b7 that parameterizes the entrainment effects between the\nsuperfluids, where \u03a9 is the angular frequency of rotation, \u03c9 the oscillation frequency observed\nin the corotating frame of the star, and l\u2032 and m are the indices of the spherical harmonic\nfunction representing the angular dependence of the r-modes. For the rs -modes, on the other\nhand, \u03ba0 is equal to 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)] at \u03b7 = 0 (no entrainment), and it almost linearly increases\nas \u03b7 is increased from \u03b7 = 0. The ro -modes, for which w\u2032 \u2261 v \u2032p \u2212 v \u2032n \u221d \u03a93 , correspond to the\nr-modes discussed by Lindblom & Mendell (2000), where v \u2032n and v \u2032p are the Eulerian velocity\nperturbations of the neutron and proton superfluids, respectively. The mutual friction in the\nsuperfluid core is found ineffective to stabilize the r-mode instability caused by the ro -mode\nexcept in a few narrow regions of \u03b7. The r-mode instability caused by the rs -modes, on the\nother hand, is extremely weak and easily damped by dissipative processes in the star.\n\nSubject headings: instabilities - stars: neutron - stars: oscillations - stars : rotation\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the roles expected for the r-mode instability to play (Andersson 1998, Friedman & Morsink\n1998) is deceleration of the spin of newly born hot neutron stars by emitting gravitational waves that carry\naway the angular momentum of the star (e.g., Lindblom et al 1998). We know, however, that among older\nand colder neutron stars as found in LMXB systems there are many rapidly rotating neutron stars like a\nmillisecond pulsar (see, e.g, Phinney & Kulkarni 1994). This fact suggests the possibility that the r-mode\ninstability does not always work well to spin down the rapid rotation of the stars. For the r-modes in\ncold neutron stars with a solid crust, for example, Bildsten & Ushomirsky (2000) suggested a damping\nmechanism operating in the viscous boundary layer at the interface between the solid crust and the fluid\ncore, to explain the clustering of spin frequencies around the value of 300Hz for accreting neutron stars\nin LMXB systems (van der Klis 2000; see also Andersson, Kokkotas, & Stergioulas 1999). For the modal\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\nproperties of the r-modes in neutron stars with a solid crust, see Yoshida & Lee (2001), who showed that\nthe r-modes in the core are largely affected by resonance with the toroidal sound modes propagating in the\nsolid crust.\nAs neutron stars cool down below T \u223c 109 K, neutrons and protons in the core are believed to be in\nsuperfluid states (e.g., Shapiro & Tuekolwsky 1983). In a rotating system of superfluids, it is well known\nthat scattering between vortices in the superfluids and normal fluid particles produces dissipation called\nmutual friction (e.g., Khalatnikov 1965, Tilley & Tilley 1990). Therefore, for people who are interested\nin the r-modes instability, it was a serious concern whether the r-mode instability could survive the\ndissipation due to mutual friction in the superfluid core of cold neutron stars, e.g., in LMXBs. It was\nLindblom & Mendell (2000) who first examined the damping effects of mutual friction in the core on the\nr-mode instability, and concluded that the mutual friction could not be strong enough to damp out the\ninstability in most of the parameter domains which we are interested in. In their analysis of the r-modes\nin neutron stars, Lindblom & Mendell (2000) employed a perturbative method in which the spin angular\nfrequency \u03a9 is regarded as the infinitesimal parameter to expand the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions\nof the modes, and they looked for the r-modes with the scalings given by \u03b2 \u2032 \u2261 \u03bc\u2032p \u2212 \u03bc\u2032n + me \u03bc\u2032e /mp \u221d \u03a94\nand w \u2032 \u2261 v \u2032p \u2212 v \u2032n \u221d \u03a93 , where \u03bcp , \u03bcn , and \u03bce are the chemical potentials of the proton, neutron, and\nelectron in the core, and v p and v n are the velocities of the proton and neutron superfluids, and the prime\n(\u2032 ) indicates the Euler perturbation of the quantity.\nRecently, Andersson & Comer (2001) discussed the dynamics of superfluid neutron star cores, and\nconfirmed an earlier result by Lee (1995) that there are no g-modes propagating in the superfluid core.\nThey also applied their argument to the r-modes in the core filled with neutron and proton superfluids,\nand suggested the existence of two distinct families of the r-modes in the core, i.e., r-modes for which the\nneutrons and the protons flow together, and those for which the neutrons and the protons are counter\nmoving. Lindblom & Mendell (2000) considered the former family of the r-modes, which are less strongly\naffected by the mutual friction than the latter.\nIn this paper, we employ a different method of calculation to investigate the r-modes in rotating\nneutron stars, although the basic equations describing the dynamics of superfluids in the core are essentially\nthe same as those given in Lindblom & Mendell (1994). Our method of solution is a variant of that used in\nLee & Saio (1986). Because the separation of variables is not possible for perturbations in rotating stars, we\nexpand the perturbations in terms of spherical harmonic functions Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) with different l's for a given m.\nWe substitute the expansions into linearized basic equations to obtain a set of simultaneous linear ordinary\ndifferential equations of the expansion coefficients, which is to be solved as an eigenvalue problem of the\noscillation frequency. In this method, we do not have to assume apriori a form of solutions for the r-modes\nin the lowest order of \u03a9. In \u00a72 we present the basic equations employed in this paper for the dynamics\nof superfluids in the core, and in \u00a73 dissipation processes considered in this paper are described. \u00a74 gives\nnumerical results, and \u00a75 and \u00a76 are for discussions and conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nOscillation Equations in the Superfluid Core of Rotating Neutron Stars\n\nMicroscopically, the superfluids in a rotating system move irrotationally everywhere except within\nthe core of vortex lines. Averaging over many vortices in the fluids, we may define the average superfluid\nvelocities < v >, which can satisfy the usual relation for uniform rotation \u2207\u00d7 < v >= 2\u03a9 in the equilibrium\nstate (see, e.g., Feynman 1972). In the following we simply use v, instead of < v >, to signify the superfluid\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nvelocities. Hydrodynamic equations for a rotating superfluid based on the two-fluid model with the normal\nfluid and superfluid components are derived, for example, in Khalatnikov (1965).\nWe derive basic equations governing superfluid motions in the neutron star core in the Newtonian\ndynamics, assuming uniform rotation of the star. The core is assumed to be filled with neutron and proton\nsuperfluids and a normal fluid of electron. We also assume perfect charge neutrality between the protons\nand electrons because the plasma frequency is much higher than the oscillation frequencies considered in\nthis paper (see, e.g., Mendell 1991a). Since the transition temperatures Tc \u223c 109 K to neutron and proton\nsuperfluids are much higher than the interior temperatures of old neutron stars (see, e.g., Epstein 1988),\nwe assume that all the neutrons and protons in the core are in superfluid states and the normal fluid\ncomponents of the fluids can be ignored.\nThe basic hydrodynamic equations employed in this paper for the neutron and proton superfluids in\nrotating neutron stars are essentially the same as those given in Mendell (1991a) and Lindblom & Mendell\n(1994). In a fluid system in which two superfluids coexist, the entrainment between the two superfluid\nmotions occurs because a Cooper pair of one fluid particles is affected by the force field produced by the\nother fluid particles (Andreev & Bashkin 1975 for a system of 3 He and 4 He superfluids). In the system\nof the neutron and proton superfluids in the core the entrainment effects between them are mediated by\nquantum mechanical nuclear force between the neutrons and the protons (e.g., Alpar et al 1984). Here, we\nintroduce the entrainment effects in mass conservation equations, which are given by\n\u2202\u03c1n\n+ \u2207 * j n = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nand\n\n\u2202\u03c1p\n+ \u2207 * j p = 0,\n(2)\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03c1n and \u03c1p are the mass densities of the neutron and proton superfluids, and the mass current vectors\nj n and j p are defined as\nj n = \u03c1nn v n + \u03c1np v p ,\n(3)\n\nand\nj p = \u03c1pp v p + \u03c1pn v n ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere v n and v p denote the velocities of the neutron and the proton superfluids, respectively, and the\ncoefficients \u03c1nn , \u03c1np , \u03c1pp , and \u03c1pn are defined to satisfy \u03c1n = \u03c1nn + \u03c1np and \u03c1p = \u03c1pp + \u03c1pn and \u03c1np = \u03c1pn\nunder Galilean transformations. The mass conservation equation for the electron fluid is given by\n\u2202\u03c1e\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1e v e ) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c1e and v e denote, respectively, the mass density and the velocity of the electron fluid. The velocity\nequation of the neutron superfluid is in an inertial frame given by\n\u2202v n\n\u03c1np\n(v p \u2212 v n ) \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 v n ) ,\n+ v n * \u2207v n = \u2212\u2207(\u03bcn + \u03a8) +\n\u2202t\n\u03c1n\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bcn is the chemical potential of neutron per unit mass, and \u03a8 is the gravitational potential. The term\nproportional to \u03c1np on the right hand side of equation (6) represents a drag force between neutrons and\nprotons.

Note that we have neglected the entropy carried by the normal fluid of electron for simplicity.\nThe Poisson equation is given by\n\u22072 \u03a8 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1,\n(9)\nwhere \u03c1 = \u03c1n + \u03c1p + \u03c1e and G is the gravitational constant.\nTo linearise the hydrodynamic equations for the superfluids in rotating neutron stars, we assume that\nthe neutron and proton superfluids and the electron normal fluid in an equilibrium state are in the same\nrotational motion with the angular velocity \u03a9 around the axis of rotation, which is along the z-axis.

We apply Chandrasekhar-Milne\nexpansion (Chandrasekhar 1933a,b, Tassoul 1978) to the hydrostatic equations to determine the function\n\u01eb in the form \u01eb(a, \u03b8) = \u03b1(a) + \u03b2(a)P2 (cos \u03b8) with P2 being the Legendre function. See Lee (1993) for the\ndefinition of \u03b1(a) and \u03b2(a). Since for uniformly rotating stars all the physical quantities in hydrostatic\nequilibrium are constant on the deformed equipotential surface, labeled by the coordinate a, we write the\nlinearised basic equations using the coordinates (a, \u03b8, \u03c6) (Saio 1981, Lee 1993). In our formulation, the\nterms up to of order of \u03a93 in the perturbed velocity equations are retained so that the eigenfrequencies of\nthe r-modes are correctly determined to the order of \u03a93 (see Yoshida & Lee 2000a).\nThe perturbations in a uniformly rotating star are expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions\nwith different l's for a given m (e.g., Lee & Saio 1986). For example, the vector \u03be n is given by\nX\n\u03bean\nSln (a)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)ei\u03c3t ,\n=\na\n\n(30)\n\n\u0015\nX \u0014\n\u03be\u03b8n\n1 \u2202 m\n\u2202 m\nn\nn\n=\nY \u2032 (\u03b8, \u03c6) ei\u03c3t ,\nHl (a) Yl (\u03b8, \u03c6) + Tl\u2032 (a)\na\n\u2202\u03b8\nsin \u03b8 \u2202\u03c6 l\n\n(31)\n\n\u0015\nX \u0014\n\u03be\u03c6n\n1 \u2202 m\n\u2202 m\nn\nn\nHl (a)\n=\nY (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u2212 Tl\u2032 (a) Yl\u2032 (\u03b8, \u03c6) ei\u03c3t ,\na\nsin \u03b8 \u2202\u03c6 l\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(32)\n\nl\u2265|m|\n\nl\u2265|m|\n\nl\u2265|m|\n\nand the Euler perturbation of the gravitational potential, \u03a8\u2032 is given as\nX\n\u03a8\u2032l (a)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)ei\u03c3t ,\n\u03a8\u2032 =\n\n(33)\n\nl\u2265|m|\n\nwhere l = |m| + 2(k \u2212 1) and l\u2032 = l + 1 for even modes, and l = |m| + 2k \u2212 1 and l\u2032 = l \u2212 1 for odd modes,\nand k = 1, 2, 3, * * *. Substituting these expansions and the like into the linearised basic equations (16)\n\u223c (19) and (21), we obtain oscillation equations given as a set of simultaneous linear ordinary differential\nequations of the expansion coefficients (see Appendix), which is to be integrated in the superfluid core.\nThe oscillation equations solved in the normal fluid envelope are the same as those given in Yoshida & Lee\n(2000a).\nTo obtain a complete solution of an oscillation mode, solutions in the superfluid core and in the normal\nfluid envelope are matched at the interface between the two domains by imposing jump conditions given by\n\u03bea = \u03bean ,\n\n\u03bea = \u03beap ,\n\n[p\u2032 ]+\n\u2212 = 0,\n\n[\u03a8\u2032 ]+\n\u2212 = 0,\n\nand [d\u03a8\u2032 /da]+\n\u2212 = 0,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere [f (x)]+\n\u2212 \u2261 lims\u21920 {f (x + s) \u2212 f (x \u2212 s)}.

The boundary conditions\nat the stellar surface are \u03b4p = 0 and \u03a8\u2032l \u221d a\u2212(l+1) , where \u03b4p is the Lagrangian perturbation of the pressure.\nFor numerical computation, oscillation equations of a finite dimension are obtained by disregarding the\nterms with l larger than lmax = |m| + 2kmax \u2212 1 in the expansions of perturbations such as given by (30) to\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(33). For the r-modes with l\u2032 = |m| calculated in this paper, we usually use kmax = 6 so that we can get\nreasonable convergence of the eigenfrequency and the eigenfunction. We solve the oscillation equations of\na finite dimension as an eigenvalue problem of the oscillation frequency \u03c9 using a Henyey type relaxation\nmethod (see, e.g., Unno et al 1989).\n\n3.\n\nDissipations\n\nThe stability of an oscillation mode of a star is determined by summing up all contributions from\nvarious damping and excitation mechanisms.

It was Andersson (1998) and Friedman & Morsink (1998) who\nrealized that the r-modes have oscillation frequencies that satisfy the instability condition.\nThe damping (or growth) time-scale \u03c4 of a normal mode may be given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\ndE\n1\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n+\n+\n,\n=\n\u03c4\n2E dt\n\u03c4GD\n\u03c4GJ\n\u03c4S\n\u03c4MF\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03c4i = 2E/(dE/dt)i . For the r-modes of l\u2032 = |m|, it is convenient to derive an extrapolation formula\nof the time-scale \u03c4 given as a function of \u03a9 and the interior temperature T (e.g., Lindblom et al 1998,\nLindblom & Mendell 2000):\n\u0012 2 \u0013l+2\n\u0012 2 \u0013l\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u03b3\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n1\n1\n1 109 K\n1\n1\n= 0\n+ 0\n+ 0\n+ 0\n,\n(45)\n\u03c4 (\u03a9, T )\n\u03c4GD \u03c0G\u03c1\u0304\n\u03c4GJ \u03c0G\u03c1\u0304\n\u03c4S\nT\n\u03c4MF \u03c0G\u03c1\u0304\nwhere \u03c1\u0304 = M/(4\u03c0R3 /3), and only the dominant term in each of the dissipation processes with l = |m|+1 = 3\n0\n0\n0\nhas been retained for the r-modes. The quantities \u03c4GD\n, \u03c4GJ\n, \u03c4S0 , and \u03c4MF\nare assumed to be only weakly\ndependent on \u03a9 and T .\n\n4.\n\nNumerical Results\n\nFollowing Lindblom & Mendell (2000), we employ a polytropic model of index N = 1 with the mass\nM = 1.4M\u2299 and the radius R = 12.57km as a background model for modal analysis. The model is divided\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ninto a superfluid core and a normal fluid envelope, the interface of which is set at \u03c1 = \u03c1s = 2.8 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 .\nIn the normal fluid envelope, we use the polytropic equation of state given by p = K\u03c12 both for the\nequilibrium structure and for the oscillation equations. The core is assumed to be filled with neutron and\nproton superfluids and a normal fluid of electron, for which an equation of state, labeled A18+\u03b4v+UIX\n(Akmal, Pandharipande, and Ravenhall 1998), is used to give the energy density (23) and the relation (26)\nused for the oscillation equations. For the mass density coefficients \u03c1nn , \u03c1pp , and \u03c1np in the core, we employ\nan empirical relation given by (see Lindblom & Mendell 2000)\n\u03c1p /\u03c1 \u2248 0.031 + 8.8 \u00d7 10\u221217 \u03c1,\n\n(46)\n\n\u03c1np = \u2212\u03b7\u03c1n ,\n\n(47)\n\nand a formula given by\nwhere \u03b7 is a parameter of order of \u223c 0.04 that parametrizes the entrainment effects between the two\nsuperfluids (Borumand, Joynt, & Klu\u017aniak 1996).\nWe find that the r-modes of l\u2032 = m in the superfluid core are split into ordinary r-modes and superfluid\no\ns\n\u2032\nr-modes, which we call ro -modes and rs -modes. The toroidal components iT\npl of the r - and r -modes\n\u2032\n3\nof l = m = 2 are plotted versus a/R for the case of \u03b7 = 0.04 and \u03a9\u0304 \u2261 \u03a9/ GM/R = 0.01 in Figure\n1, where the solid, dotted, dashed, and dash-dotted curves are used to indicate respectively the toroidal\np\nn\nn\np\ncomponents iTm\n, iTm+2\n, iTm\n, and iTm+2\nin the superfluid core, and the amplitude normalization is given\nby max(|iTm |) = 1. The figure shows that the two superfluids in the core flow together for the ro -modes,\np\nwhile they counter-move for the rs -modes. Note that the amplitudes of iTm+2\nfor the rs -mode are not\np\nnecessarily negligibly small compared with those of iTm\nin the core. This splitting of the r-modes in\nthe superfluid core into two distinct families has been suggested by Andersson & Comer (2001). For the\np\nn\nro -mode, the radial dependence of the difference iTm\n\u2212 iTm\nin the core is given in Figure 2, which shows\nthat the difference is quite small compared with the normalization max(|iTm |) = 1. It is important to note\nthat the l\u2032 = m r-modes having basically nodeless and dominant iTm are the only r-modes we can find, as\nin the case of the r-modes in isentropic models (see Yoshida & Lee 2000a,b).\nIn Table 1, the expansion coefficients \u03ba0 and \u03ba2 , and the scaled damping (or growth) timescales \u03c4i0 for\nthe l\u2032 = m = 2 r-modes are tabulated for the cases of \u03b7 = 0, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06, where the coefficients \u03ba0\nand \u03ba2 are defined in the expansion:\n\u03c9/\u03a9 = \u03ba0 (\u03b7) + \u03ba2 (\u03b7)\u03a9\u03042 + O(\u03a9\u03044 ).\n\n(48)\n\n0\nNote that the exponent \u03b3 employed to define \u03c4MF\nin equation (45) is \u03b3 = 2.5 for the ro -modes and \u03b3 = 0.5\ns\nfor the r -modes for the non-zero \u03b7's in the table. This is because the velocity difference w\u2032 = v \u2032p \u2212 v \u2032n\napproximately scales as w\u2032 \u221d \u03a93 for the ro -modes and as w\u2032 \u221d \u03a9 for the rs -modes (see Lindblom &\nMendell 2000). The coefficient \u03ba0 for the ro -modes is numerically equal to 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)], and \u03ba2 is almost\nindependent of the entrainment parameter \u03b7. The value of \u03ba0 is the same as the value found by Lindblom\n& Mendell (2000) and the value of \u03ba2 differs only by 2.5%, suggesting that the ro -modes are the same\nmodes found by Lindblom & Mendell (2000). (Because of different normalization conventions the value\nof \u03ba2 reported by Lindblom & Mendell must be multiplied by a factor of 4/3 before comparing with our\nresults.) The coefficients \u03ba0 and \u03ba2 for the rs -modes, on the other hand, appreciably depends on \u03b7, and \u03ba0\ndeviates from 2m/[l\u2032(l\u2032 + 1)] as \u03b7 is increased from \u03b7 = 0. This kind of deviation of \u03ba0 from 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)]\nfor the l\u2032 = m r-modes has been found for relativistic neutron stars where the relativistic factor GM/c2 R is\nregarded as a parameter (Yoshida 2001; Yoshida & Lee 2002a). Computing the rs -mode of l\u2032 = m = 2 as a\nfunction of \u03b7, we find that a linear formula given by\n\n\u03bas0 (\u03b7) \u2248 0.667 + 9.35\u03b7\n\n(49)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ngives a good fit to the rs -mode frequency except at avoided crossings with inertial modes (see below). At\n\u03b7 = 0, the coefficients \u03ba0 for the ro - and rs -modes are both equal to 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)], which suggests that in\nthe lowest order of \u03a9 the two r-modes are degenerate at \u03b7 = 0. In Figure 3, the toroidal components iTm\nand iTm+2 of the ro - and rs -modes of l\u2032 = m = 2 at \u03a9\u0304 = 0.01 are given versus a/R for the case of \u03b7 = 0.\nThe amplitudes of iTm+2 are much smaller than those of iTm both for the ro - and rs -modes. This figure\np\nn\nalso shows that |iTm\n\u2212 iTm\n| 6\u226a 1 in the core for the ro -mode at \u03b7 = 0, for which we find that w\u2032 \u221d \u03a9.\nInertial modes in the superfluid core are also split into ordinary and superfluid inertial modes, which\nwe call io - and is -modes. In Table 2, we have given \u03ba0 for io - and is -modes for m = 2 and \u03b7 = 0, and see,\ne.g., Lockitch & Friedman (1999) and Yoshida & Lee (2000a) for the classification scheme employed here for\ninertial modes. For given m and l0 \u2212 |m|, we find at \u03b7 = 0 pairs of io - and is -modes that have close values\nof \u03ba0 , and the number of the pairs is equal to l0 \u2212 |m|. As an example, for the case of m = 2 and \u03b7 = 0,\nthe eigenfunctions iTl\u2032 are shown for the io - and is -modes of \u03ba0 = 0.5180 and \u03ba0 = 0.5077 in Figure 4, for\nthose of \u03ba0 = 0.4215 and \u03ba0 = 0.4060 in Figure 5, and for those of \u03ba0 = 1.1046 and \u03ba0 = 1.1134 in Figure 6.\nThe inertial modes in Figure 4 belong to l0 \u2212 |m| = 3 and those in Figures 5 and 6 to l0 \u2212 |m| = 5. Note\nthat the ro - and rs -modes belong to l0 \u2212 |m| = 1 (e.g., Yoshida & Lee 2000a). It is generally observed for\ninertial modes with long radial wavelengths that the two superfluids co-move in the core for the io -modes,\nand they counter-move for the is -modes. The coefficient \u03ba0 for the io -modes only weakly depends on the\nentrainment parameter \u03b7 (see Figure 7). The coefficient \u03ba0 for the is -modes, on the other hand, increases\napproximately linearly as \u03b7 is increased from \u03b7 = 0 (see Figure 8). See Yoshida & Lee (2002b) for extended\ndiscussions on inertial modes in the superfluid core.\nThe rs -modes (ro -modes) experience mode crossings with io -modes (is -modes) as the parameter \u03b7 is\nincreased from \u03b7 = 0. For the case of m = 2 and \u03a9\u0304 = 0.01, Figure 7 illustrates an avoided crossing between\nthe rs -mode of l\u2032 = m and the io -mode that tends to \u03ba0 = 1.1046 as \u03b7 \u2192 0. In this figure, the dashed line\nis given by equation (49). For mode crossings between the ro -mode and is -modes, on the other hand, it is\nquite difficult to numerically discern whether the mode crossings result in avoided crossing or degeneracy of\nthe mode frequencies at the crossing point. Most prominent among such mode crossings of the ro -mode of\nl\u2032 = m = 2 are those with the is -modes that tend to \u03ba0 = 0.5077 and \u03ba0 = 0.4060 as \u03b7 \u2192 0. For the case of\nm = 2 and \u03a9\u0304 = 0.01, the two mode crossings which occur at \u03b7 \u2248 0.0230 and 0.0484 are shown in Figure 8,\nwhere the solid lines and the dashed line are for the is -modes and the ro -mode, respectively. We note that\nthe ratio \u03c9/\u03a9 \u2248 \u03ba0 for the ro -mode is almost constant, equal to 2m/[l\u2032(l\u2032 + 1)] = 0.6667 for l\u2032 = m = 2,\nwhile the ratios \u03c9/\u03a9 for the is -modes increase approximately linearly with increasing \u03b7. Figure 9 shows the\np\nn\ndifferences iTm\n\u2212 iTm\nversus a/R for the l\u2032 = m = 2 ro -modes at \u03b7 = 0.023 (panel a) and 0.0484 (panel b),\nand Figure 10 the eigenfunctions iTl\u2032 for the is -modes of m = 2 at \u03b7 = 0.023 (panel a) and at \u03b7 = 0.0484\n(panel b), where we have assumed \u03a9\u0304 = 0.01 and the normalization max(|iTm |) = 1. The amplitudes of the\ndifferences at the mode crossing points are much larger than amplitudes of the difference off the crossing\npoints (see, e.g., Figure 2). The resemblance between the is -modes of l0 \u2212 |m| = 3 at \u03b7 = 0 (Figure 4b) and\nat \u03b7 = 0.023 (Figure 10a) and between the is -modes of l0 \u2212 |m| = 5 at \u03b7 = 0 (Figure 5b) and \u03b7 = 0.0484\n(Figure 10b) is obvious.\n0\n0\nfor the ro -modes of l\u2032 = m = 2 are\nand \u03c4GD\n\u00bfFrom Table 1, we find that the growth timescales \u03c4GJ\n\u2032\nalmost the same as those for the l = m = 2 r-modes of the N = 1 polytropic model without superfluidity\n0\n0\nfor the\nand \u03c4GD\nin the core (see, e.g., Yoshida & Lee 2000a). On the other hand, the growth timescales \u03c4GJ\ns\no\ns\nr -modes are much longer than those of the r -modes, and the instability caused by the r -modes is much\nweaker than the instability by the ro -modes. This is because the amount of gravitational wave radiation\np\nn\nemitted from the rs -modes is much smaller than that from the ro -modes since (\u03c1p iTm\n+ \u03c1n iTm\n)/\u03c1 \u223c 0 and\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n0\n\u03c1\u2032 \u223c 0 for the rs -modes. It is interesting to note that \u03c4GJ\nof the rs -modes at \u03b7 6=\np 0 is by several orders\n\u2032\nof magnitude longer than that at \u03b7 = 0. Figure 11 shows, as a function of a/R, |\u03c9\u03c3 2l+1 |Nl /2EJmm\n(a)\nR\na\ns\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfor the r -modes at \u03b7 = 0 (dashed line) and at \u03b7 = 0.04 (solid line), where Jmm (a) = 0 dadJmm /da. As\n\u2032\nfound for the case of \u03b7 = 0.04, the negative contributions to Jmm\n(a = R) in the envelope almost completely\n0\ncancel out the positive contributions in the core, which leads to extremely long growth timescales \u03c4GJ\nof\nthe rs -modes at \u03b7 6= 0.\n0\nFigure 12 illustrates the dependence of \u2212\u03c4MF\non the entrainment parameter \u03b7 for the l\u2032 = m = 2\n0\nro -mode, and we find that \u2212\u03c4MF\nhas prominent and deep minimums at \u03b7 \u2248 0.230 and 0.484., which is\nconsistent with the result by Lindblom & Mendell (2000). Note that we have assumed \u03c1s = 2.8 \u00d7 1014g/cm3\nfor the interface between the core and the envelope. These prominent minimums result from the mode\ncrossings with the long radial wavelength is -modes that tend to \u03ba0 = 0.5077 and \u03ba0 = 0.4060 as \u03b7 \u2192 0\n(Figure 8; see also Andersson & Comer 20001). Mode crossings of the ro -mode with is -modes that have\n0\nmuch shorter radial wavelengths result in narrow and shallow minimums of \u2212\u03c4MF\n, as found for \u03b7 \u223c\n>0.05.\nThese minor dips were not found by Lindblom & Mendell (2000). We guess that the r-modes calculated by\nLindblom & Mendell (2000) are less strongly affected by inertial modes associated with large l0 \u2212 |m| having\nshort radial wavelengths since they ignored terms higher than \u03a94 in their perturbative method. Comparing\n0\nour results with those by Lindblom & Mendell (2000), we find that the damping timescale \u2212\u03c4MF\nat a given\n\u03b7 is about by an order of magnitude shorter than that they obtained, and that our values of \u03b7 \u2248 0.0230 and\n0\n0.0484 for the local minimums of \u2212\u03c4MF\nare slightly larger than their critical values 0.02294 and 0.04817.\nFrom Table 1 we also find that the value of \u03ba2 found here for the ro -modes is about by 2.5% larger than\nthe value they found. We guess that these differences between the two calculations partly come from the\ndifferences in the way of evaluating the derivatives of the thermodynamical quantities that appear in the\noscillation equations. For example, Lindblom & Mendell (2000) used \u03c1\u2032 = (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202p)\u03b2 p\u2032 + (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202\u03b2)p \u03b2 \u2032 , for\nwhich they assumed (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202p)\u03b2 = (\u03c1/2p) from the polytropic relation p = K\u03c12 and employed a fitting\nformula to (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202\u03b2)p obtained from Akmal et al's equation of state (1998), where \u03b2 = \u03bc\u0303 \u2212 \u03bcn . In this\npaper, on the other hand, we used \u03c1\u2032 = (Q11 + \u03b6Q21 )\u03bc\u2032n + (Q12 + \u03b6Q22 )\u03bc\u2032p , and the coefficients Qij were all\ncalculated by using equations (23) to (29) with Akmal et al's equation of state (1998).\n\nThe eigenfunction \u03b4\u03b2(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03b4\u03b20 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) + (4/3)\u03b4\u03b22 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\u03a9\u03042 + O(\u03a9\u03044 ) in Lindblom & Mendell (2000)\np\nn\nmay be given in terms of the eigenfunctions y2,k\nand y2,k\nas\n\u03b4\u03b2(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = (Ma /M )(R/a)\u03a9\u0304\u22122\n\nX\n\n\u2206y2,k (a)Ylk m (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(50)\n\nk\u22651\np\nn\nwhere r = a[1 + \u01eb(a, \u03b8)], and \u2206y2,k (a) = y2,k\n(a) \u2212 y2,k\n(a) and see Appendix for definition of the functions\np(n)\n\ny2,k (a). Assuming \u03b4\u03b20 = 0, we obtain\n\u03b4\u03b22 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2248 0.75 \u00d7 (Mr /M )(R/r)\u03a9\u0304\u22124\n\nX\n\nk\u22651\n\n\u2206y2,k (r)flk m Plm\n(cos \u03b8)eim\u03c6 \u2261\nk\n\nX\n\n\u03b4\u03b22,k Plm\n(cos \u03b8)eim\u03c6 ,\nk\n\n(51)\n\nk\u22651\n\nwhere the mean radial distance a have been replaced by the radial distance r, and the factor flm is\ndefined by the relation Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = flm Plm (cos \u03b8)eim\u03c6 , and lk = |m| + 2k \u2212 1. In Figure 13, we plot the\nfunctions \u03b4\u03b22,k (r) for the ro -mode of l\u2032 = m = 2 at \u03b7 = 0.04, applying amplitude normalization given by\ny2,k=1 (R) = fm+1,m \u03a9\u03042 at the surface, where the solid, dotted, and dashed lines are for \u03b4\u03b22,1 , 100 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b22,2 ,\nand 100 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b22,3 , respectively. Since |\u03b4\u03b22,1 (r)| >> |\u03b4\u03b22,k (r)| for k \u2265 2, the \u03b8 depenence of the function\nm\n\u03b4\u03b22 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is well represented by a single associated Legendre function Pm+1\n(cos \u03b8), and is not necessarily\nthe same \u03b8 dependence of the function \u03b4\u03b22 found by Lindblom & Mendell (2000). The amplitude of the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nfunction \u03b4\u03b22,1 (r) is about by a factor of 3 larger than the amplitude of \u03b4\u03b22 calculated by Lindblom &\n0\nMendell (2000), which is consistent with the result that \u03c4MF\nin this paper is about by an order of magnitude\n0\nshorter than \u03c4MF they obtained.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIf we employ a set of the dependent variables defined as (see Lindblom & Mendell 2000)\n\u03be=\n\n\u03c1n v \u2032n + \u03c1p v \u2032p\n,\ni\u03c9 \u03c1\u0302\n\n\u03bew =\n\nw\u2032\n,\ni\u03c9\n\nU=\n\np\u2032\n+ \u03a8\u2032 ,\n\u03c1\u0302\n\n\u03b2 \u2032 = \u03bc\u0303\u2032 \u2212 \u03bc\u2032n ,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 = \u03c1n + \u03c1p , the continuity equations (16) and (17) and the velocity equations (18) and (19) are\nrewritten as\n\u03c1\u2032n + \u03c1\u2032p + \u2207 * (\u03c1\u0302\u03be) = 0,\n(53)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1\u2032p\n\u03c1\u03032\n\u03c1\u2032\n\u03c1p\n\u03c1\u03032\n(54)\n\u03be w * \u2207 ln\n\u2212 n + \u03be * \u2207 ln\n+\n+ \u2207 * \u03bew = 0,\n\u03c1p\n\u03c1n\n\u03c1n\n\u03c1n \u03c1p\n\u03c1\u0302\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1p\n\u03c1n \u03c1p\n\u2207 ln\n\u03b2\u2032,\n(55)\nF (\u03be) = \u2212\u2207U + 2\n\u03c1\u0302\n\u03c1n\nF (\u03be w ) + i\u03c9\n\n\u03c1np \u03c1\u0302\nD (\u03bew ) = \u2212\u2207\u03b2 \u2032 ,\n\u03c1n \u03c1p\n\n(56)\n\nand the linearized Poisson equation remains the same:\n\u0001\n\u22072 \u03a8\u2032 = 4\u03c0G \u03c1\u2032n + \u03c1\u2032p ,\n\n(57)\n\nwhere D(\u03be) = \u03be \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 v 0 ), and the terms of order of me /mp have been ignored for simplicity.

Note that the quantities like \u2207 * \u03be, \u03be * \u2207\u03c1,\nthe lowest order for the r-modes. For the expansions given above, we have\n\n\u03c1\u2032p ,\n\n(60)\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nand \u03a8 are of order of \u03a9 in\n\nF (\u03be) = F 2 (\u03be 0 , \u03ba0 , s0 )\u03a92 + F 4 (\u03be 0 , \u03be 2 , \u03ba0 , \u03ba2 , s0 , s2 )\u03a94 + O(\u03a96 ),\n\n(61)\n\nand we may not need to give the full expressions of F 2 and F 4 here. Equations (55) and (56) suggest\nthe existence of two families of r-modes, that is, r-modes, which are governed by equation (55) and have\n\u03ba0 = 2m/[l\u2032(l\u2032 + 1)], and r-modes, which are governed by equation (56) and have \u03ba0 6= 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)]. If we\nassume F 2 (\u03be 0 ) = \u2212\u2207U2 in equation (55), we obtain the lowest order r-mode solution given by iTm \u221d a|m|\u22121\nand \u03ba0 = 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)], which leads to \u03b22\u2032 = 0 from equation (55), and to \u03be w\n0 = 0 from equation (56).\n\u2032 \u2032\nThis suggests the existence of the r-mode solutions, for which \u03ba0 = 2m/[l (l + 1)], and \u03be 0 6= 0 and U2 6= 0,\n\u2032\nbut \u03be w\n0 = 0 and \u03b22 = 0. The solutions of this kind correspond to the r-modes Lindblom & Mendell (2000)\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nobtained in their perturbative treatment, and to the ro -modes found in this paper. On the other hand,\nbecause of the drag force, i.e., the term proportional to D(\u03be w ), \u03ba0 of the r-modes governed by equation\n\u2032\n(56) is not necessarily equal to 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)]. For these solutions we may expect \u03bew\n0 6= 0 and \u03b22 6= 0 from\nequation (56), and \u03be 0 6= 0 and U2 6= 0 from equation (55). The solutions of this kind correspond to the\nrs -modes found in this paper (see also Andersson & Comer 2001).\nTo show the importance of the drag force for the existence of the r-mode solutions with the scaling\nw\u2032 \u221d \u03a93 , we calculate the ro - and rs -modes by ignoring the drag force terms proportional to D(\u03be) on the\nright hand side of the velocity equations (18) and (19). The results are summarized in Table 3, in which the\ncoefficients \u03ba0 , \u03ba2 , and \u03c4i0 's are tabulated for the ro - and rs -modes of l\u2032 = m = 2 for the case of \u03b7 = 0.04.\nWhen we ignore the drag force terms, we can not find the ro -modes with the scaling of w\u2032 \u221d \u03a93 and\nthe r-modes with the scaling w \u2032 \u221d \u03a9 are the only r-mode solutions we can find, and hence the exponent\n0\n\u03b3 to define \u03c4MF\nin the table is equal to 0.5 for both the ro - and rs -modes. In Figure 14, the toroidal\ncomponents iTm and iTm+2 of the two r-modes are given for \u03b7 = 0.04, where we have assumed \u03a9\u0304 = 0.01\nand the normalization max(|iTm |) = 1. The amplitudes of iTm+2 are completely negligible compared to\nthose of iTm . In the absence of the drag force, \u03ba0 's for the two r-modes are both equal to 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)],\nindependent of \u03b7, which means that the frequencies of the two r-modes are degenerate in the lowest order\nof \u03a9. These results suggest that the r-mode solutions with w \u2032 \u221d \u03a93 can be found only when the frequencies\nof the r-modes are not degenerate in the lowest order in \u03a9. In this sense, it is reasonable to find w \u2032 \u221d \u03a9\nfor the ro -modes at \u03b7 = 0 since \u03ba0 's of the ro - and rs -modes are equal to each other at \u03b7 = 0, as shown by\nTable 1.\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have discussed the modal properties of the r-modes of neutron stars with the core\nfilled with neutron and proton superfluids. We numerically find that the r-modes of rotating neutron\nstars with the superfluid core are split into ordinary ro -modes and superfluid rs -modes, and that the two\nsuperfluids in the core flow together for the ro -modes and they counter move for the rs -modes. These\nfindings are consistent with earlier suggestions made analytically by Andersoon & Comer (2001). We also\nfind that, although \u03ba0 of the ro -modes is numerically equal to 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)], almost independent of the\nentrainment parameter \u03b7, \u03ba0 of the rs -modes approximately linearly increases from 2m/[l\u2032 (l\u2032 + 1)] as \u03b7 is\nincreased from \u03b7 = 0. The ro -modes have the scaling of w\u2032 \u221d \u03a93 and are the same r-modes discussed by\nLindblom & Mendell (2000), while the rs -modes have the scaling of w\u2032 \u221d \u03a9. The instability caused by the\nrs -modes is found much weaker than the instability by the ro -mode and will be easily stabilized by various\ndissipation processes in the star.\nWe have confirmed that, except in a few narrow regions of \u03b7 around the prominent local minimums of\n0\n, the dissipation due to mutual friction in the superfluid core is ineffective to stabilize the instability\n\u03c4MF\nby the ro -modes, as first shown by Lindblom & Mendell (2000). We have shown that these prominent local\n0\nminimums of \u2212\u03c4MF\nare caused by mode crossings between the ro -mode and the superfluid inertial is -modes\nwith long radial wavelengths comparable to those of the ro -mode (see also Andersson & Comer 2001).\nSince mutual friction is almost always very strong for the rs -modes and the instability by the rs -modes\nitself is quite weak, only the instability by the ro -modes will be of direct observational importance, e.g., as\nmechanisms that generate gravitational waves from normal modes of rotating neutron stars and/or cause\nthe clustering of spin frequencies around 300Hz for neutron stars in LMXB's, unless there exist other strong\ndamping mechanisms for the r-modes (see Jones 2001a,b; Lindblom & Owen 2002; Haensel, Levenfish &\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nYakovlev 2002).\nIn this paper, we have made a brief report on a numerical result of inertial modes in the superfluid\ncore. We find that inertial modes in superfluid neutron stars are also split into ordinary inertial io -modes\nand superfluid inertial is -modes. It is generally observed for inertial modes with long radial wavelengths\nthat the two superfluids co-move in the core for the io -modes, and they counter-move for the is -modes\n(see Yoshida & Lee 2002b for more complete discussions on inertial modes in the superfluid core). Inertial\nmodes are expected to work as a mechanism limiting the amplitude growth of the r-modes (Morsink 2002).\nThere are many interesting and challenging problems we have to deal with before we can conclude\ndefinitely about the neutron star oscillations. Confronting their cooling calculations of neutron stars with\nobservational data for the surface temperature of several neutron stars, Kaminker, Haensel, & Yakovlev\n(2001), and Kaminker, Yakovlev, & Gnedin (2002) suggested that neutron superfluidity in the core of\nmiddle-aged neutron stars should be weak in the sense that the critical temperature Tc is less than 108 K.\nIf this is the case, there exist no neutron superfluids in the core of temperatures T > 108 K. If neutrons in\nthe core are in normal state, modal properties of low frequency oscillations propagating in the core will be\ndifferent from those for the core filled with neutron and proton superfluids, since buoyant force in the core,\nproduced by thermal and/or chemical stratification (Reisenegger & Goldreich 1992), comes into play. The\nnormal neutron fluid core with stratification will support g-mode propagation, and the buoyant force in it\nwill affect inertial modes in slowly rotating neutron stars. The nodeless r-modes of l\u2032 = m, however, will\nremain almost the same even in the presence of buoyant force (see Yoshida & Lee 2000b), and damping\ndue to mutual friction in the core will remain weak for the ro -modes, for which neutron and proton fluids\nco-move. Let us point out a possibility of using neutron star binaries as a probe to investigate existence or\nnon-existence of neutron superfludity in the core, since tidally excited low frequency modes will be g-modes\nin the normal fluid core but inertial modes in the superfluid core, and the different tidal responses will result\nin different binary evolutions. The presence of a solid crust and a magnetic field in neutron star interior is\nanother factor that makes complicated the problems of global oscillations of the stars. The solid crust is\nnot a rigid body and supports its own normal modes (see, e.g., McDermott et al 1988, Lee & Strohmayer\n1996). For example, there exist torsional modes propagating in the crust, which can be resonantly coupled\nwith the r-modes in the normal fluid core (Yoshida & Lee 2001; Levin & Ushomirsky 2001). Quite recently,\nusing a local analysis of perturbations, Kinney & Mendell (2002) have suggested that no r-mode solution\nto the magnetohydrodynamic equations (e.g., Mendell 1998) exists in the superfluid core when both the\nneutron and proton vortices are pinned to the solid crust. This may suggest that a careful formulation\nof boundary conditions at the core-crust interfaces will be necessary to obtain reliable solutions to global\noscillations of neutron stars, particularly when a magnetic field is essential for the oscillations.\n\nA.\n\nOscillation Equations in the Superfluid Core\n\nFor the oscillation equations in the superfluid core, we employ vectors y n1 , y n2 , y p1 , y p2 , y 3 , and y 4 ,\nwhose components are given by\nn\ny1,k\n= Sln ,\n\nn\ny2,k\n=\n\n\u03bc\u2032n,l + \u03a8\u2032l\n,\nga\n\np\ny1,k\n= Slp ,\n\np\ny2,k\n=\n\n\u03bc\u0303\u2032l + \u03b6\u03a8\u2032l\n,\nga\n\ny3,k =\n\n\u03a8\u2032l\n,\nga\n\ny4,k =\n\n1 d\u03a8\u2032l\n,\ng da\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere l = |m| + 2(k \u2212 1) for even modes and l = |m| + 2k \u2212 1 for odd modes, and k = 1, 2, 3, * * *.
