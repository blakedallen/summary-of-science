Chiral effective field theory (\u03c7EFT) provides a systematic\nconstruction of these forces, including a hierarchy of\nmany-body forces of decreasing strength [1]. Renormalization group (RG) methods can be used to soften the\nshort-range repulsion and short-range tensor components\nof the initial chiral interactions so that convergence of nuclear structure calculations is greatly accelerated [2, 3].\nThe difficulty is that these transformations (or any other\nsoftening transformations) change the short-range manybody forces. To account for these changes, we present\nin this letter the first consistent evolution of three-body\nforces by using the Similarity Renormalization Group\n(SRG) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which offers a technically simpler\napproach to evolving many-body forces than other RG\nformulations. Our results show that both the many-body\nhierarchy of \u03c7EFT and the improved convergence properties are preserved.\nThe SRG is a series of unitary transformations of the\nfree-space Hamiltonian (H \u2261 H\u03bb=\u221e ),\nH\u03bb = U\u03bb H\u03bb=\u221e U\u03bb\u2020 ,\n\n(1)\n\nlabeled by a momentum parameter \u03bb that runs from \u221e\ntoward zero, which keeps track of the sequence of Hamiltonians (s = 1/\u03bb4 has been used elsewhere [7, 8]). These\ntransformations are implemented as a flow equation in \u03bb\n(in units where ~2 /M = 1),\ndH\u03bb\n4\n= \u2212 5 [[T, H\u03bb ], H\u03bb ] ,\nd\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nwhose form guarantees that the H\u03bb 's are unitarily equivalent [6, 7].\nThe appearance of the nucleon kinetic energy T in\nEq. (2) leads to high- and low-momentum parts of H\u03bb\nbeing decoupled, which means softer and more convergent potentials [9]. This is evident in a partial-wave momentum basis, where matrix elements hk|H\u03bb |k \u2032 i connecting states with (kinetic) energies differing by more than\n2\n\u20322 2\n4\n\u03bb2 are suppressed by e\u2212(k \u2212k ) /\u03bb factors and therefore the states decouple as \u03bb decreases. (Decoupling also\nresults from replacing T in Eq. (2) with other generators [6, 7, 10, 11].) The optimal range for \u03bb is not yet\n\nestablished and also depends on the system, but experience with SRG and other low-momentum potentials suggest that running to about \u03bb = 2.0 fm\u22121 is a good compromise between improved convergence from decoupling\nand the growth of induced many-body interactions [9].\n(Also, differences between using T and the diagonal of\nH\u03bb in Eq. (2), which can be very important in some situations [10], are negligible in this \u03bb range.)\nTo see how the two-, three-, and higher-body potentials\nare identified, it is useful to decompose H\u03bb in secondquantized form. Schematically (suppressing indices and\nsums),\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nH\u03bb = hT ia\u2020 a + hV\u03bb ia\u2020 a\u2020 aa + hV\u03bb ia\u2020 a\u2020 a\u2020 aaa + * * * ,\n(3)\nwhere a\u2020 , a are creation and destruction operators with\nrespect to the vacuum in some (coupled) single-particle\n(2)\n(3)\nbasis. This defines hT i, hV\u03bb i, hV\u03bb i, . . . as the onebody, two-body, three-body, . . . matrix elements at each\n\u03bb. Upon evaluating the commutators in Eq. (2) using\nH\u03bb from Eq. (3), we see that even if initially there are\nonly two-body potentials, higher-body potentials are generated with each step in \u03bb. Thus, when applied in an\nA-body subspace, the SRG will \"induce\" A-body forces.\n(2)\nBut we also see that hT i is fixed, hV\u03bb i is determined\n(3)\nonly in the A = 2 subspace with no dependence on hV\u03bb i,\n(3)\n(2)\nhV\u03bb i is determined in A = 3 given hV\u03bb i, and so on.\nSince only the Hamiltonian enters the SRG evolution\nequations, there are no difficulties from having to solve\nT matrices in all channels for different A-body systems.\nHowever, in a momentum basis the presence of spectator\nnucleons requires solving separate equations for each set\n(n)\nof hV\u03bb i matrix elements. In Refs. [12, 13], a diagrammatic approach is introduced to handle this decomposition. But while it is natural to solve Eq. (2) in momentum\nrepresentation, it is an operator equation so we can use\nany convenient basis. Here we evolve in a discrete basis,\nwhere spectators are handled without a decomposition\nand induced many-body forces can be directly identified.\nHaving chosen such a basis, we obtain coupled first-order\ndifferential equations for the matrix elements of the flowing Hamiltonian H\u03bb , where the right side of Eq. (2) is\nevaluated using simple matrix multiplications.\n\n\f2\n\nGround-State Energy [MeV]\n\n\u22127.4\n\n3\n\nNN-only\nNN + NNN-induced\nNN + NNN\n\nH\n\n\u22127.6\n\u22127.8\n\u22128.0\n\n3\n\nN LO (500 MeV)\n\n\u22128.2\n\u22128.4\n\u22128.6\n\nExpt.\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u03bb [fm ]\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Ground-state energy of 3 H as a function of the SRG evolution parameter, \u03bb.

This is a translationally invariant,\nanti-symmetric basis for each A, with a complete set of\nstates up to a maximum excitation of Nmax ~\u03a9 above the\nminimum energy configuration, where \u03a9 is the harmonic\noscillator parameter. The procedures used here build directly on Ref. [13], which presents a one-dimensional implementation of our approach along with a general analysis of the evolving many-body hierarchy.\nWe start by evolving H\u03bb in the A = 2 subsystem, which\n(2)\ncompletely fixes the two-body matrix elements hV\u03bb i.\nNext, by evolving H\u03bb in the A = 3 subsystem we determine the combined two-plus-three-body matrix elements.\nWe can isolate the three-body matrix elements by sub(2)\ntracting the evolved hV\u03bb i elements in the A = 3 basis [13]. Having obtained the separate NN and NNN\nmatrix elements, we can apply them unchanged to any\nnucleus. We are also free to include any initial threenucleon force in the initial Hamiltonian without changing the procedure. If applied to A \u2265 4, four-body (and\nhigher) forces will not be included and so the transformations will be only approximately unitary. The questions\nto be addressed are whether the decreasing hierarchy of\nmany-body forces is maintained and whether the induced\nfour-body contribution is unnaturally large. We summarize in Table I the different calculations to be made for\n3\nH and 4 He to confront these questions.\nThe initial (\u03bb = \u221e) NN potential used here is the\n500 MeV N3 LO interaction from Ref. [15]. The initial\nNNN potential is the N2 LO interaction [16] in the local\nform of Ref. [17] with constants fit to the average of triton and 3 He binding energies and to triton beta decay\naccording to Ref. [18]. We expect similar results from\nother initial interactions because the SRG drives them\ntoward near universal form; a survey will be given in\nRef. [19]. NCSM calculations with these initial interactions and the parameter set in Table I of Ref. [18] yield\nenergies of \u22128.473(4) MeV for 3 H and \u221228.50(2) MeV for\n4\nHe compared with \u22128.482 MeV and \u221228.296 MeV from\nexperiment, respectively. So there is a 20 keV uncertainty\nin the calculation of 4 He from incomplete convergence\nand a 200 keV discrepancy with experiment. The latter\nis consistent with the omission of three- and four-body\nchiral interactions at N3 LO. These provide a scale for\nassessing whether induced four-body contributions are\nimportant compared to other uncertainties.\nIn Fig. 1, the ground-state energy of the triton is plotted as a function of the flow parameter \u03bb. Evolution is\nfrom \u03bb = \u221e, which is the initial (or \"bare\") interaction,\ntoward \u03bb = 0. We use Nmax = 36 and ~\u03a9 = 28 MeV, for\nwhich all energies are converged to better than 10 keV.\nWe first consider an NN interaction with no initial NNN\n(\"NN-only\"). If H\u03bb is evolved only in an A = 2 system, higher-body induced pieces are lost. The resulting\nenergy calculations will only be approximately unitary\nfor A > 2 and the ground-state energy will vary with \u03bb\n(squares).

The hV\u03bb i and hV\u03bb i matrix elements were evolved in A = 2 and A = 3 with Nmax = 28\nand then truncated to Nmax = 18 at each \u03bb to diagonalize 4 He. The NN-only curve has a similar shape as for\nthe triton. In fact, this pattern of variation has been ob-\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: Definitions of the various calculations.\nNo initial NNN interaction and do not keep NNN-induced interaction.\nNo initial NNN interaction but keep the SRG-induced NNN interaction.\nInclude an initial NNN interaction and keep the SRG-induced NNN interaction.\n\nserved in all SRG calculations of light nuclei [3]. When\nthe induced NNN is included, the evolution is close to\nunitary and the pattern only depends slightly on an initial NNN interaction. In both cases the dotted line represents the converged value for the initial Hamiltonian.\nAt large \u03bb, the discrepancy is due to a lack of convergence at Nmax = 18, but at \u03bb < 3 fm\u22121 SRG decoupling\ntakes over and the discrepancy is due to short-range induced four-body forces, which therefore contribute about\n50 keV net at \u03bb = 2 fm\u22121 . This is small compared to the\nrough estimate in Ref. [20] that the contribution from\nthe long-ranged part of the N3 LO four-nucleon force to\n4\nHe binding is of order a few hundred keV.

We also compare to a Lee-Suzuki\n(L-S) effective interaction, which has been used in the\nNCSM to greatly improve convergence [21, 22]. These\neffective interactions result from unitary transformations\nwithin the model space of a given nucleus, in contrast to\nthe free-space transformation of the SRG, which yields\nnucleus-independent matrix elements.\nThe SRG calculations are variational and converge\nsmoothly and rapidly from above with or without an\ninitial three-body force. The dramatic improvement in\nconvergence rate compared to the initial interaction is\nseen even though the \u03c7EFT interaction is relatively soft.\nThus, once evolved, a much smaller Nmax basis is adequate for a desired accuracy and extrapolating in Nmax\nis also feasible.\nFigure 4 illustrates for 4 He the same rapid convergence with Nmax of an SRG-evolved interaction. However, in this case the asymptotic value of the energy differs slightly because of the omitted induced four-body\ncontribution. (The SRG-evolved asymptotic values for\ndifferent ~\u03a9 differ by only 10 keV, so the gap between\nthe converged bare/L-S results and the SRG results is\ndominated by the induced NNNN rather than incomplete\nconvergence). Convergence is even faster for lower \u03bb values [19], ensuring a useful range for the analysis of few-\n\n\f4\n\n30\n\nTjon line for NN-only potentials\nSRG NN-only\n\n29\n\nSRG NN+NNN (\u03bb >1.7 fm )\n\u03bb=1.8\n\u03bb=1.5\n\n28\n\nExpt.\n\u03bb=2.0\n\u03bb=2.5\n\n27\n\n\u03bb=1.2\n\n4\n\nEb( He) [MeV]\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03bb=3.0\n28.5\n\n26\n\n28.4\n3\n\nN LO\n(500 MeV)\n\n25\n\n28.3\n28.2\n\n24\n\n7.6\n\n7.8\n\n8\n\n8.2\n\n8.45\n\n8.4\n\n8.5\n\n8.6\n\n8.8\n\n3\n\nEb( H) [MeV]\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Binding energy of the alpha particle\nvs. the binding energy of the triton.

However, because of the strong density\ndependence of four-nucleon forces, it will be important\nto monitor the size of the induced four-body contributions for heavier nuclei and nuclear matter.\nThe impact of evolving the full three-body force is\nneatly illustrated in Fig. 5, where the binding energy of\n4\nHe is plotted against the binding energy of 3 H. The experimental values of these quantities, which are known\nto a small fraction of a keV, define only a point in this\nplane (at the center of the X, see inset).

In\ncontrast, the short trajectory of the SRG with the NN\n+ NNN interaction (shown for \u03bb \u2265 1.8 fm\u22121 ) highlights\nthe small variations from the omitted four-nucleon force.\nNote that a trajectory plotted for NN+NNN-induced calculations would be a similarly small line at the N3 LO\nNN-only point.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a practical method\nto use the SRG to evolve NNN (and higher many-body)\nforces in a harmonic oscillator basis. Calculations of\nA \u2264 4 nuclei including NNN show the same favorable\nconvergence properties observed elsewhere for NN-only,\nwith a net induced four-body contribution in A = 4 that\nis smaller than the truncation errors of the chiral interaction. The soft SRG interactions are an alternative to\nthe use of Lee-Suzuki effective interactions in NCSM and\nthe HO matrix elements can also be used (after conversion to a Slater-determinant HO basis as needed) for coupled cluster and many-body perturbation theory calculations. A more complete analysis of convergence and\ndependencies for the energy and other observables for\nfew-body systems, as well as results for other interactions and choices of generator in Eq. (2), will be given in\na forthcoming publication [19].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank E. Anderson, S. Bogner, J. Drut, R. Perry,\nS. Quaglioni, and A.
