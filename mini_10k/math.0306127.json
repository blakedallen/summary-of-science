Thus, when one takes a limit of limits, or a colimit of colimits (in a context where the relevant limits or colimits all exist),\none can reverse the order of the two limit operations, or of the two colimit\noperations, without changing the result. In contrast, left and right universal\nconstructions do not in general respect one another. (For instance, the free\ngroup on a direct product set X \u00d7 Y is not isomorphic to the direct product\nof the free group on X and the free group on Y ).\nBut there are classes of cases where, anomalously, certain limits commute with\ncertain colimits. For instance, given directed systems of sets (Xi )I and (Yi )I\nindexed by the same partially ordered set I, one finds that lim (Xi \u00d7 Yi ) \u223c\n=\n\u2212\u2192\n(lim Xi ) \u00d7 (lim Yi ). Indeed, the fact that we can construct a direct limit of\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nalgebras by putting an algebra structure on the direct limit of their underlying\nsets is a consequence of this fact, given that algebra operations on X are set\nmaps X\u00d7 * * * \u00d7X \u2192 X.\nThis note investigates the question of which small categories E have the\nproperty that limits of functors from E to Set always commute with direct\nlimits, that is, with colimits over directed partially ordered sets. It has been\nobserved [15, Thm. IX.2.1, p.211], [12, Thm. 4.73, p.72] that this happens if\nE is a finite category, i.e., has only finitely many objects and finitely many\nmorphisms. More generally, it occurs whenever E has finitely many objects\nand finitely generated morphism-set ([1, Prop. 7.9.3] = Corollary 8 below).\nThe result of \u00a72 (first paragraph of the above abstract) is equivalent to the\nstatement that if E is a one-object category whose morphisms form a group,\nthis finite generation condition is necessary as well as sufficient.\nIn a general one-object category E, the morphisms form a monoid M. By the\nresult noted above, finite generation of M is sufficient for the construction of\nlimits over E (i.e., fixed-point sets of M-sets) to commute with that of direct\nlimits, but in this case it is not necessary. In \u00a74 we obtain two criteria each of\nwhich is necessary as well as sufficient. We find in \u00a75 that one of these, finite\ngeneration of the improper left congruence on M, when reformulated as finite\npresentability of the trivial M-set, generalizes to arbitrary small categories\nE, while the other, finite generation of M under multiplication and \"right\ndivision\", generalizes nicely to categories E with finitely many objects.\nIn \u00a77 we examine the case where E is the category Jcat induced by a partially\nordered set J, and translate our general criterion into a condition on J. Half\nof the condition we get can be stated in familiar language: It says that the\n2\n\n\fset of minimal elements of J is finite, and every element lies above a minimal\nelement. (This is in fact necessary and sufficient for the comparison maps\nassociated with our limits and colimits to be injective in all cases; it is also\nnecessary for them always to be surjective.) The remaining condition appears\nto be new. In language which we shall define, it says that the set of elements\nof J \"critical\" with respect to the minimal elements is finite, and that these\ncritical elements \"gather\" all minimal elements under every element of J.\nNote that the results of this paper only concern limits and colimits of functors\nto Set; the behavior of functors to other categories can be strikingly different. For instance [1, Exercise 7.9.5], in Setop , direct limits do not in general\ncommute with equalizers, though equalizers are limits over a certain finite category; but they do commute with not necessarily finite small products; so we\nhave both negative and positive deviations from the behavior of Set-valued\nfunctors. Clearly, it would be interesting to investigate more classes of cases\nof commutativity between limits and colimits: for functors with codomains\nother than Set, and for colimits over categories other than directed partially\nordered sets. If we fix one of the three variables \u2013 the small category over\nwhich we take limits, the small category over which we take colimits, and the\ncodomain category \u2013 then we get a Galois connection [1, \u00a75.5] on the other\ntwo, and can study the resulting closure operators. The exercises in [15, \u00a7IX.2]\nand the results and exercises at the end of [1, \u00a77.9] give scattered results along\nthese lines, but for the most part, the topic seems wide open for study!\nI am indebted to Birge Huisgen-Zimmermann and Ken Goodearl for organizing\nthe gathering at which I first spoke about some of these results, to Max Kelly,\nArthur Ogus, and Boris Schein for references to the literature, and to the\nreferee for several helpful corrections and suggestions.\nThe present note has various possible audiences, ranging from any mathematician who uses direct limits, to the specialist in semigroups or categories\nor partially ordered sets. I hope the reader will be patient with my reviewing\ndetails that may be familiar to him or her, and also with my following, in \u00a73,\na somewhat leisurely path of motivation to the results on monoids.\n\n2\n\nDirect limits and group actions.\n\nRecall that a partially ordered set (I, \u2264) is said to be directed if for every pair\nof elements i, j \u2208 I, there exists k \u2208 I majorizing both, i.e., satisfying k \u2265 i\nand k \u2265 j. A directed system of sets means a family of sets (Xi )i\u2208I indexed by\na nonempty directed partially ordered set I, and given with connecting maps\n\u03b1i,j : Xi \u2192 Xj (i \u2264 j) such that each \u03b1i,i is the identity map of Xi , and\nwhenever i \u2264 j \u2264 k, one has \u03b1i,k = \u03b1j,k \u03b1i,j . (So a more complete notation\n3\n\n\ffor the directed system is (Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I .)\nIn this situation one has the concept of the direct limit of the given system.\nF\nThis is constructed by forming the disjoint union I Xi , and dividing out by\nthe least equivalence relation \u223c such that x \u223c \u03b1i,j (x) whenever x \u2208 Xi and\ni \u2264 j. Denoting the resulting set lim I Xi , and writing [x] for the equivalence\n\u2212\u2192\nF\nclass therein of x \u2208 I Xi , we get, for each j \u2208 I, a map \u03b1j,\u221e : Xj \u2192 lim I Xi\n\u2212\u2192\ntaking x \u2208 Xj to [x]. The characterization of lim I Xi that we will use here\n\u2212\u2192\nis that it is a set given with maps \u03b1j,\u221e : Xj \u2192 lim I Xi for each j \u2208 I, such\n\u2212\u2192\nthat every element of lim I Xi is of the form \u03b1j,\u221e (x) for some j \u2208 I, x \u2208 Xj ,\n\u2212\u2192\nand such that\n(1)\n\n\u03b1i,\u221e (x) = \u03b1j,\u221e (y) if and only if there exists k \u2265 i, j such that\n\u03b1i,k (x) = \u03b1j,k (y).\n\nProperty (1) is easily deduced from the above construction of lim I Xi , using\n\u2212\u2192\nthe directedness of I. Note that it includes the relations\n(2)\n\n\u03b1i,\u221e (x) = \u03b1j,\u221e (\u03b1i,j (x)) (i \u2264 j \u2208 I, x \u2208 Xi )\n\ncorresponding to the generators of the equivalence relation in that construction.\nIf G is a group, then a directed system of left G-sets means a directed system\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I of sets, such that each Xi is given with a left action of G, and\neach of the connecting maps \u03b1i,j is a morphism of G-sets (a G-equivariant\nmap). Henceforth we will generally omit the qualifier \"left\". Given such a\ndirected system, it is easy to verify that lim I Xi admits a unique G-action\n\u2212\u2192\nmaking the maps \u03b1i,\u221e morphisms of G-sets, i.e., such that\n(3)\n\ng \u03b1i,\u221e (x) = \u03b1i,\u221e (gx) (g \u2208 G, i \u2208 I, x \u2208 Xi ).\n\nFor any G-set X, let us write\nX G = {x \u2208 X | (\u2200g \u2208 G) gx = x}\nfor the fixed-point set of the action. If (Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I is a directed system of\nG-sets, we see that each map \u03b1i,j carries the fixed set XiG into XjG . Writing\n\u03b2i,j for the restriction of \u03b1i,j to a map XiG \u2192 XjG , we thus get a directed\nsystem of sets (XiG , \u03b2i,j ), and we can form its direct limit lim I XiG .\n\u2212\u2192\nIt is now straightforward to verify that one has a map\n(4)\n\n\u03b9 : lim I XiG \u2212\u2192 (lim I Xi )G ,\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n(x \u2208 XiG ).\n\ndefined by\n\n\u03b9(\u03b2i,\u221e (x)) = \u03b1i,\u221e (x)\n\nTheorem 1 If G is a group, I a directed partially ordered set, and\n4\n\n\f(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I a directed system of G-sets, then the set-map \u03b9 of (4) is one-toone.\nMoreover, for any group G, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(5)\n\nFor every directed partially ordered set I and directed system\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I of G-sets, the set-map \u03b9 of (4) is bijective.\n\n(6)\n\nG is finitely generated.\n\nPROOF. The assertion of the first sentence follows from (1) and the fact\nthat the maps \u03b2i,j are restrictions of the \u03b1i,j .\nTo see that (6) implies (5), let {g1 , . . . , gn } be a finite generating set for G,\nand consider any element of (lim I Xi )G , which we may write \u03b1i,\u221e (x) for some\n\u2212\u2192\ni \u2208 I and x \u2208 Xi . The element x \u2208 Xi may not itself be fixed under G,\nbut by assumption, for every g \u2208 G we have g \u03b1i,\u221e (x) = \u03b1i,\u221e (x), in other\nwords, \u03b1i,\u221e (gx) = \u03b1i,\u221e (x). By (1) this means that for each g \u2208 G there\nexists k(g) \u2265 i in I such that \u03b1i,k(g) (gx) = \u03b1i,k(g) (x).\nSince I is directed, we can find a common upper bound k for k(g1 ), . . . , k(gn ),\nand we see from the G-equivariance of the maps \u03b1k(gj ),k that \u03b1i,k (x) will be\ninvariant under all of {g1 , . . . , gn }, hence will belong to XkG . The element\n\u03b2k,\u221e (\u03b1i,k (x)) is thus an element of lim I XiG , and (2) shows that it is mapped\n\u2212\u2192\nby (4) to the given element \u03b1i,\u221e (x) \u2208 (lim I Xi )G , as required.\n\u2212\u2192\nConversely, if G is a non-finitely-generated group, let I be the set of finitely\ngenerated subgroups of G, partially ordered by inclusion; this is clearly a\ndirected partially ordered set. For each H \u2208 I, let XH be the transitive G-set\nG/H, and define connecting maps by \u03b1H1 ,H2 (gH1 ) = gH2 for H1 \u2264 H2 ; this\ngives a directed system. Since each H \u2208 I is a proper subgroup of G, each\nof the G-sets XH satisfies (XH )G = \u2205, so lim I (XH )G = \u2205. On the other\n\u2212\u2192\nhand, any two elements g1 H1 \u2208 XH1 and g2 H2 \u2208 XH2 have the same image in\nXH3 for any H3 containing H1 , H2 , and g1\u22121g2 , so lim I XH is the one-point\n\u2212\u2192\nG-set. Thus (lim I XH )G 6= \u2205, and (5) fails. \u2737\n\u2212\u2192\nDigression. One may ask whether (5) is equivalent to the corresponding statement with I restricted to be the set N of natural numbers with the usual\nordering \u2264, this being the kind of direct limit one generally first learns about.\nIf we call this weakened condition (5N), I claim the proof of Theorem 1 may\nbe adapted to show that (5N) is equivalent to\n(6N)\n\nEvery chain H0 \u2264 H1 \u2264 . . . of subgroups of G indexed by N\nand having union G is eventually constant.\n5\n\n\fIndeed, suppose G is a group for which (5N) fails, so that we have a directed\nsystem (Xi )i\u2208N and an element \u03b1j,\u221e (x) \u2208 (lim N Xi )G which is not in the\n\u2212\u2192\nimage of \u03b9. Then no \u03b1j,k (x) lies in XkG , and letting Hi be the isotropy\nsubgroup of \u03b1j,j+i(x) for each i, it is easy to see that these subgroups give a\ncounterexample to (6N). Conversely, if we have a counterexample to (6N), then\nsetting Xi = G/Hi gives a counterexample to (5N).\nBut are there any groups that satisfy (6N) and not (6)? Clearly (6N) cannot\nhold in any countable non-finitely-generated group. It will also fail in any\ngroup which admits a homomorphism onto a group in which it fails, from\nwhich one can show that it fails in any non-finitely-generated abelian group\n[2, paragraph following Question 8]. However, examples are known of uncountable nonabelian groups that satisfy (6N): Infinite direct powers of nonabelian\nsimple groups [13], full permutation groups on infinite sets [16,2], and others\n[5,6,19,20].\n(Groups satisfying (6N) but not (6) are said to be of \"uncountable cofinality\".\nThe same condition on modules has been studied under a surprising variety\nof names [8, p.895, top paragraph].)\n\n3\n\nMonoid actions \u2013 initial observations.\n\nIf we replace the group G of the preceding section with a general monoid M,\na large part of the discussion goes over unchanged. Given a directed system\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I of left M-sets, we get an M-set structure on lim I Xi , and there\n\u2212\u2192\nis a natural map\n(7)\n\n\u03b9 : lim I XiM \u2212\u2192 (lim I Xi )M\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n(x \u2208 XiM ),\n\ngiven by \u03b9(\u03b2i,\u221e (x)) = \u03b1i,\u221e (x)\n\nwhich is always one-to-one; and again we may ask for which M it is true that\n(8)\n\nFor every directed partially ordered set I and directed system\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I of M-sets, the set-map \u03b9 of (7) is bijective.\n\nThe argument used in the proof of Theorem 1, (6) =\u21d2 (5), shows that a\nsufficient condition is\n(9)\n\nM is finitely generated.\n\nAttempting to reproduce the converse argument, we can say, as before, that\nif M is not finitely generated its finitely generated submonoids N form a\ndirected partially ordered set; however, there is no concept of factor-M-set\nM/N, as would be needed to continue the argument.\n6\n\n\fAnd in fact, there exist non-finitely-generated monoids for which (8) holds. For\ninstance, let M be the multiplicative monoid of any field F ; note that 0 \u2208 M.\nGiven an element \u03b1j,\u221e (x) \u2208 (lim I Xi )M , we have \u03b1j,\u221e (x) = 0 \u03b1j,\u221e (x) =\n\u2212\u2192\n\u03b1j,\u221e (0x), hence there exists k \u2208 I such that \u03b1j,k (x) = \u03b1j,k (0x). We now\nobserve that for every u \u2208 M we have\nu \u03b1j,k (x) = u \u03b1j,k (0x) = \u03b1j,k ((u 0)x) = \u03b1j,k (0x) = \u03b1j,k (x),\nso \u03b1j,k (x) \u2208 XkM , so the arbitrary element \u03b1j,\u221e(x) \u2208 (lim I Xi )M is in the\n\u2212\u2192\nimage of (7).\nRecalling that an element z of a monoid M is called a right zero element if\nuz = z for all u \u2208 M, we see that the above argument shows that a sufficient\ncondition for (8) to hold, clearly independent of (9), is\n(10)\n\nM has at least one right zero element.\n\nWith a little thought, one can come up with a common generalization of (9)\nand (10). Recall that a left ideal of a monoid means a subset L closed under\nleft multiplication by all elements of M. Combining the ideas of the two\npreceding arguments, one can show that (8) holds if\n(11)\n\nM has a nonempty left ideal L which is finitely generated as a\nsemigroup.\n\nBut we can generalize this still further. We don't need left multiplication by\nevery element of M to send every element of L into L. We claim it suffices\nto assume that\nM has a finitely generated subsemigroup S such that {a \u2208 M |\naS \u2229 S 6= \u2205} generates M.\nIndeed, assuming the above holds, and given as before a directed system\n(Xi )i\u2208I of M-sets and an element \u03b1j,\u221e (x) \u2208 (lim I Xi )M , choose k \u2265 j such\n\u2212\u2192\nthat for all elements g of a finite generating set for S, we have g \u03b1j,k (x) =\n\u03b1j,k (x); thus \u03b1j,k (x) is invariant under the action of S. Writing \u03b1j,k (x) = y,\nnote that for any a \u2208 M such that aS \u2229 S 6= \u2205, if we take s, t \u2208 S such\nthat as = t, and apply the two sides of this equation to y, we get ay = y,\nshowing that y is fixed under the action of each such element a. Since such\nelements generate M, we can conclude that y \u2208 XkM , from which (8) follows\nas before.\nIn the condition just considered, nothing is lost if we replace the semigroup S\nby the monoid S \u222a {1}. (The same was not true of (11), where the property\nof being an ideal would have been lost.) So let us formulate that condition in\nthe more natural form\n7\n\n\f(12)\n\nM has a finitely generated submonoid M0 such that {a \u2208 M |\naM0 \u2229 M0 6= \u2205} generates M.\n\nTo see that this is strictly weaker than (11), consider the monoid presented\nby infinitely many generators xn (n \u2208 N) and y, and the relations saying\nthat all the elements xn y (n \u2208 N) are equal. Then (12) holds with M0 the\nsubmonoid generated by {y, x0 y}, but one can verify that there is no left ideal\nL as in (11). (In particular, the left ideal My is not finitely generated as a\nsemigroup: the infinitely many elements xn x0 y (n \u2208 N) cannot be obtained\nusing finitely many elements of that ideal.)\nNote that in condition (12), one obtains the elements of M0 from a finite generating set using arbitrarily many multiplications; then gets each element a in\nthe set-bracket expression from two elements of M0 by an operation of \"right\ndivision\", and then obtains the general element of M from these by again\nusing arbitrarily many multiplications. Looked at this way, it would be more\nnatural to allow arbitrary sequences of multiplications and right divisions; i.e.,\nto consider the condition\n(13)\n\nThere exists a finite subset S \u2286 M such that the least subset\nN \u2286 M satisfying (i) S \u222a {1} \u2286 N, (ii) a, b \u2208 N =\u21d2 ab \u2208 N\nand (iii) ab, b \u2208 N =\u21d2 a \u2208 N, is M itself.\n\nWe shall see in the next section that this, too implies (8). That (13) is weaker\nthan (12) may be seen by considering the monoid with presentation\nM = hxn , yn , z, w (n \u2208 N) | xn yn z = z, yn w = wi.\nNamely, one can show that given a finitely generated submonoid M0 \u2286 M,\nonly finitely many of the elements xn can satisfy xn M0 \u2229 M0 6= \u2205, hence not\nall xn will appear in the set-expression shown in (12), so, as these elements are\nirreducible, (12) cannot hold. However, starting with the finite set {z, w}, the\n\"right division\" process of (13) gives us all elements of the forms xn yn and yn ,\nanother application of right division gives all elements xn , and from the yn ,\nthe xn , and the original two elements z and w, closure under multiplication\nproduces all of M.\n\n4\n\nLeft congruences, and a precise criterion.\n\nTo approach more systematically the problem of characterizing monoids that\nsatisfy (8), let us recall a useful heuristic for generalizing results about groups\nG and G-sets to monoids M and M-sets:\n\n8\n\n\f(14)\n\nGroups : normal subgroups : subgroups : :\nmonoids : congruences : left congruences.\n\nNormal subgroups N of a group G classify the homomorphic images f (G) of\nG, by listing the elements that fall together with 1 under f. To determine the\nstructure of a homomorphic image f (M) of a monoid M, it is not sufficient\nto consider elements that fall together with 1; instead one must look at the set\nof all pairs of elements that fall together, C = {(a, b) \u2208 M\u00d7M | f (a) = f (b)}.\nSets C that arise in this way are called congruences on M; these are precisely\nthe subsets C \u2286 M\u00d7M such that\n(15)\n\nC is an equivalence relation which is closed under left and right\ntranslation by elements of M.\n\nWhen we study the structures of left G-sets X for G a group, the key concept\nis the set Gx of elements of G fixing a given x \u2208 X, which may be any\nsubgroup. For M a monoid and x an element of a left M-set, the analogous\nentity is the set Cx = {(a, b) \u2208 M\u00d7M | ax = bx}. This can be any subset\nC \u2286 M\u00d7M satisfying\n(16)\n\nC is an equivalence relation closed under left translation by all\nelements of M.\n\nSuch a set is called a left congruence on M.\nFor G a group, every G-set is a disjoint union of orbits Gx \u223c\n= G/H. There\nis no such simple structure theorem for a set X on which a monoid M acts.\nNevertheless, such an X is, of course, a union of orbits Mx \u223c\n= M/Cx , and\nthis fact will allow us to reduce (8) to a condition on left congruences.\n(Aside: We have mentioned 2-sided congruences, i.e., sets satisfying (15), only\nfor perspective. Right actions of monoids lead to a third concept, that of a\nright congruence, left-right dual to (16). But since right actions of M are\nequivalent to left actions of the opposite monoid, we lose no generality by\nrestricting attention in this note to left M-sets.)\nGiven a monoid M and a subset R \u2286 M\u00d7M, there is a least left congruence\nC containing R, the left congruence generated by R, obtained by closing\nR under the obvious operations (one each to obtain reflexivity, symmetry,\ntransitivity, and left translation by each element of M). Thus, one can speak\nof a left congruence being finitely generated.\nThe whole set M\u00d7M constitutes the improper left congruence on M. We\nshall now show that the necessary and sufficient condition on a monoid M\nfor (8) to hold is\n\n9\n\n\f(17)\n\nThe improper left congruence on M is finitely generated.\n\nMoreover, we will find that the final condition (13) of the preceding section is\nalso equivalent to this.\nThe reader who is inclined to skip the proof below as straightforward should\nnote that the step (8) =\u21d2 (17) involves an unexpected hiccup; I therefore\nrecommend reading at least that step.\nTheorem 2 If M is a monoid, I a directed partially ordered set, and\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I a directed system of M-sets, then the set-map \u03b9 of (7) is oneto-one.\nMoreover, for any monoid M, the following implications hold among the conditions introduced above:\n(9)\nw\nw\n\u007f\n\n(10) =\u21d2 (11) =\u21d2 (12) =\u21d2 (13) \u21d0\u21d2 (8) \u21d0\u21d2 (17).\n\nPROOF. The first assertion and the implications through (13) have already\nbeen noted. (Moreover, none of those implications is reversible; examples were\ngiven where this was not obvious.) We shall complete the proof by showing\n(13) =\u21d2 (8) =\u21d2 (17) =\u21d2 (13).\nGiven a finite set S as in (13) and an element \u03b1j,\u221e (x) \u2208 (lim I Xi )M , let us\n\u2212\u2192\ntake k \u2208 I such that the finitely many relations s \u03b1j,k (x) = \u03b1j,k (x) (s \u2208 S)\nall hold, and let y = \u03b1j,k (x). Then it is easy to check that the set N = {s \u2208\nM | sy = y} satisfies conditions (i)-(iii) of (13), hence is all of M. Thus y\nis an element of XkM mapping to the given element \u03b1j,\u221e (x) of (lim I Xi )M ,\n\u2212\u2192\nproving (8).\nThe proof that (8) =\u21d2 (17) starts like the corresponding argument for groups:\nIf the improper left congruence on M is not finitely generated, let I be the set\nof all finitely generated left congruences on M, partially ordered by inclusion.\nThe M-sets XC = M/C (C \u2208 I) will form a directed system such that\nlim I XC is the 1-element M-set; hence (lim I XC )M 6= \u2205; but we claim that\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\neach set XCM (C \u2208 I) is empty.\nFor assume, on the contrary, that XCM were nonempty. If M were a group,\nthat would make XC a singleton, hence it would make C the improper left\ncongruence, a contradiction. For M a general monoid, we can only conclude\nthat some equivalence class [a] \u2208 XC is fixed under the action of M. However,\n10\n\n\fgiven such an [a], let C \u2032 be the left congruence on M generated by C and the\none additional pair (a, 1). Then in M/C \u2032 the generating element [1] = [a] is\nM-fixed, so C \u2032 is the improper left congruence, this time indeed contradicting\nthe assumption that the latter is not finitely generated.\nFinally, to show (17) =\u21d2 (13), suppose {(a1 , b1 ), . . . , (an , bn )} is a finite generating set for the improper left congruence on M. Let S = {a1 , . . . , an , b1 , . . . ,\nbn }, let N be the set constructed from S as in (13), and let U \u2286 M\u00d7M\nbe the set of ordered pairs which can be written (as, at) with a \u2208 M and\ns, t \u2208 N. By the closure properties of N we see that each (as, at) \u2208 U either has both components in N (if a \u2208 N, by (13)(ii)) or neither (if a \u2208\n/ N,\nby (13)(iii)). It follows that the least equivalence relation C containing U will\nnot relate elements in N with elements not in N. Moreover, U is closed under\nleft translation by members of M, hence so is C, i.e., C is a left congruence\non M. But C contains {(a1 , b1 ), . . . , (an , bn )}, so by choice of this set, C\nmust be the improper left congruence; hence as it does not relate elements in\nN with elements not in N, we must have N = M, establishing (13). \u2737\n\nWe remark that none of conditions of the above theorem except (9) is rightleft symmetric. Indeed, let M consist of the identity element and an infinite\nset S of right-zero elements. Then M satisfies (10), hence satisfies all these\nconditions other than (9), but I claim that the opposite monoid M op does\nnot satisfy (17), hence does not satisfy any of the conditions shown. For any\nequivalence relation on the underlying set of a monoid respects both left multiplication by the identity and left multiplication by any left zero element;\nhence every equivalence relation on M op is a left congruence; but the improper equivalence relation on an infinite set is not finitely generated.\nIncidentally, there is a simpler example for monoids than for groups showing\nthat (8) can fail but the analogous statement (8N) on direct limits indexed by\nthe natural numbers hold; equivalently, that the improper left congruence may\nbe non-finitely generated, yet not expressible as the union of a countable chain\nof proper left congruences. Let M = \u03c91 , the first uncountable ordinal, made a\nmonoid under the commutative binary operation sup. Every left congruence\non M corresponds to a decomposition into disjoint convex sets (i.e., intervals);\nlet us associate to each proper left congruence C the least \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c91 such that\n(0, \u03b1) \u2208\n/ C. By considering the sequence of ordinals associated in this way\nwith a countable ascending chain of such left congruences, we see that its\nunion cannot be the improper left congruence.\nBefore leaving the topic of monoids and their left congruences, let me mention a tantalizing open question of Hotzel [11] (slightly restated): If a monoid\nM has ascending chain condition on left congruences, must M be finitely\ngenerated? An affirmative answer has been proved under the assumption of\n11\n\n\fascending chain condition on both right and left congruences [14]. For some\nfurther observations see [17, Problem 1].\n\n5\n\nFunctors on small categories.\n\nAs noted in the introduction, a monoid M can be regarded as the system\nof morphisms of a one-object category E. An M-set X is then equivalent\nto a functor E \u2192 Set, and the fixed-point set of the action of M on X is\nthe limit of that functor. In the remaining sections, we shall extend the ideas\nof the preceding section by replacing fixed-point sets of monoid actions with\nlimits of set-valued functors on a general small category.\nIf E is a small category we shall, to maintain parallelism with preceding\nsections, call a covariant functor E \u2192 Set an \"E-set\", and denote such\nfunctors by X and neighboring letters. Objects of E will generally be denoted E, F, . . . and morphisms of E by letters a, b, . . . . For E, F \u2208 Ob(E),\nthe set of morphisms E \u2192 F will be written E(E, F ). We will assume\nthat E(E, F ) and E(E \u2032, F \u2032 ) are disjoint unless E = E \u2032 and F = F \u2032 . If\n\u03b1 : X \u2192 X \u2032 is a morphism of E-sets, its component set-maps will be denoted\n\u03b1(E) : X(E) \u2192 X \u2032 (E) (E \u2208 Ob(E)).\nWe recall that if X is an E-set, then lim E X can be constructed as the set of\n\u2190\u2212\nOb(E)-tuples x = (xE )E\u2208Ob(E) , with xE \u2208 X(E) for each E \u2208 Ob(E), which\nsatisfy the \"compatibility\" conditions\n(18)\n\n(\u2200 E, F \u2208 Ob(E), a \u2208 E(E, F )) X(a)(xE ) = xF .\n\nBy a directed system of E-sets we shall mean a family of E-sets (Xi )i\u2208I indexed\nby a nonempty directed partially ordered set I, and given with morphisms of\nE-sets \u03b1i,j : Xi \u2192 Xj (i \u2264 j \u2208 I) such that each \u03b1i,i is the identity morphism\nof the E-set Xi , and for i \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2208 I, one has \u03b1i,k = \u03b1j,k \u03b1i,j .\nGiven such a system, we see that for each E \u2208 Ob(E), the sets Xi (E)\n(i \u2208 I) and set-maps \u03b1i,j (E): Xi (E) \u2192 Xj (E) form a directed system of\nsets. If we take the direct limit of each of these systems, functoriality of the\ndirect limit construction yields, for each morphism a \u2208 E(E, F ), a set-map\nlim i\u2208I Xi (E) \u2192 lim i\u2208I Xi (F ) which we shall write (lim i\u2208I Xi )(a), and whose\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\naction on elements is described by\n(19)\n\n(lim i\u2208I Xi )(a)(\u03b1j,\u221e(E)(y)) = \u03b1j,\u221e (F )(Xj (a)(y)) (y \u2208 Xj (E)).\n\u2212\u2192\n\nThese maps together make the family of direct-limit sets (lim i\u2208I Xi (E))E\u2208Ob(E)\n\u2212\u2192\ninto an E-set, which we shall denote lim i\u2208I Xi . (It is not hard to show that\n\u2212\u2192\n12\n\n\fthis E-set is in fact the direct limit, i.e., colimit [15, p.67], [1, \u00a7\u00a77.5-7.6], of the\ndirected system (Xi )i\u2208I in the category of E-sets, though we shall not need\nthat fact.) As with any E-set, we can take its category-theoretic limit, getting\na set\nlim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ).\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nOn the other hand, starting with our original directed system (Xi )i\u2208I of Esets, we can take the limit over E of each E-set Xi , getting a system of sets\n(lim E Xi )i\u2208I . The functoriality of this limit construction yields connecting\n\u2190\u2212\nmaps which we may denote\nlim E \u03b1i,j : lim E Xi \u2192 lim E Xj\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\n(i \u2264 j \u2208 I),\n\nso we may form the direct limit of these sets, getting a set\nlim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\nAnd once again there is a natural set-map connecting these constructions,\n(20)\n\n\u03b9 : lim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ) \u2212\u2192 lim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\n\nTo describe \u03b9 explicitly, consider an element of lim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ), written as\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\n\u03b1i,\u221e (x) for some i \u2208 I and x \u2208 lim E Xi . Since x is an Ob(E)-tuple (xE ) sat\u2190\u2212\nisfying (18), we can apply \u03b1i,\u221e (E) to each component xE , getting an Ob(E)tuple of elements of the sets lim i\u2208I Xi (E) (E \u2208 Ob(E)). The compatibility\n\u2212\u2192\nconditions (18) on the components xE of the given element (xE ) imply the\ncompatibility of the components of the resulting family (\u03b1i,\u221e (E)(xE ))E\u2208Ob(E) ,\nso that this becomes an element of lim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ), which is easily shown to\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nbe independent of the choice of expression \u03b1i,\u221e (x) for our given element of\nlim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\nThis time, however, even injectivity of \u03b9 is not automatic. To obtain a criterion\nfor it to hold, we will use a lemma on partially ordered sets. Recall that a\nsubset D of a partially ordered set J is called a downset (or \"order ideal\") if\ns < t \u2208 D =\u21d2 s \u2208 D. We shall regard the set of downsets of any partially\nordered set as ordered by inclusion. A partially ordered set is called downward\ndirected (the dual of \"directed\") if for any two elements u, v of the set, there\nis an element w majorized by both of them.\nLemma 3 Let J be a partially ordered set. Then the following conditions are\nequivalent:\n(21)\n\nThere exists a finite subset A \u2286 J such that every element of J\nmajorizes at least one element of A .\n\n13\n\n\f(22)\n\nJ has only finitely many minimal elements, and every element of\nJ majorizes a minimal element.\n\n(23)\n\nEvery set S of nonempty downsets of J which is nonempty and\ndownward directed under inclusion has nonempty intersection.\n\nPROOF. Clearly (22) =\u21d2 (21). To show (21) =\u21d2 (23), let A be as in (21),\nlet S be as in the hypothesis of (23), and for each a \u2208 A which does not\nbelong to all the elements of S, choose an element s(a) \u2208 S not containing a.\nSince A is finite and S is downward directed, we can find some s \u2208 S which\nis majorized by (i.e., is a subset of) all these sets s(a). Being a nonempty\ndownset, s must contain some element of A by (21), and by choice of s that\nelement belongs to all members of S, proving (23).\nFinally, assuming (23) we will prove (22). On the one hand, (23), applied\nto chains S and combined with Zorn's Lemma (used upside down) shows\nthat every nonempty downset contains a minimal nonempty downset, which\nmust be a singleton consisting of a minimal element; hence every element of J\nmajorizes a minimal element. Moreover, if the set of minimal elements were infinite, then the set S of cofinite subsets of that set would be a counterexample\nto (23); so there are indeed only finitely many minimal elements. \u2737\nWe can now get a criterion for the injectivity of the set-maps \u03b9, and a little\nmore.\nProposition 4 If E is a small category, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(24)\n\nFor every directed partially ordered set I and directed system\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I of E-sets, the set-map \u03b9 of (20) is one-to-one.\n\n(25)\n\nThere exists a finite family A of objects of E such that every\nobject of E admits a morphism from one of the objects of A.\n\nMoreover, condition (25) is also necessary for the map \u03b9 to be surjective for\nall directed systems.\n\nPROOF. First, assume (25), and let us be given two elements \u03b1j,\u221e (x) and\n\u03b1j \u2032 ,\u221e (y) in lim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ) (where x = (xE )E\u2208Ob(E) and y = (yE )E\u2208Ob(E) ),\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\nhaving the same image in lim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ). Thus, the images of these two\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nOb(E)-tuples agree in each component lim i\u2208I Xi (E) (E \u2208 Ob(E)). By the\n\u2212\u2192\ndirectedness of I we can find k majorizing both j and j \u2032 and such that\nfor each of the finitely many objects E \u2208 A, \u03b1j,k (E)(xE ) and \u03b1j \u2032,k (E)(yE )\n14\n\n\fcoincide. Now by assumption, every F \u2208 Ob(E) admits a morphism from one\nof the objects E \u2208 A, so the conditions (18) on the Ob(E)-tuples \u03b1j,k (xE )\nand \u03b1j \u2032 ,k (yE ) show that the F -components of these tuples coincide as well.\nHence \u03b1j,k (x) = \u03b1j \u2032 ,k (y); hence \u03b1j,\u221e (x) = \u03b1j \u2032 ,\u221e (y), proving (24).\nTo get the converse, let us define a preordering on Ob(E) by writing E \u2264 F\nif there exists a morphism from E to F, and let J be the partially ordered\nset obtained by dividing Ob(E) by the equivalence relation \"E \u2264 F \u2264 E \".\nIf (25) fails, this says that J does not satisfy (21), hence by the preceding\nlemma we can find a downward directed set S of nonempty downsets in J\nhaving empty intersection. We shall now construct a directed system of E-sets\nindexed by the (upward) directed partially ordered set S op .\nGiven s \u2208 S, let us say that an object E \u2208 Ob(E) \"belongs to\" s if the\nequivalence class of E in J is a member of s. For each s \u2208 S, we define an\nE-set Xs by letting Xs (E) be the two-element set {\u22121, +1} if E belongs to\ns, and the one-element set {0} otherwise. Given a morphism a \u2208 E(E, F ),\nwe let Xs (a) be the identity on {\u22121, +1} if E and F both belong to s; as\ns is a downset, the remaining possibilities all have F not belonging to s, in\nwhich case we let Xs (a) be the unique map Xs (E) \u2192 Xs (F ) = {0}.\nIf s \u2287 t are members of S, then we define the map \u03b1s,t : Xs \u2192 Xt to act\nas the identity at objects E \u2208 Ob(E) belonging either to both s and t or\nto neither, and as the unique map {\u22121, +1} \u2192 {0} on elements belonging\nto s but not to t; these maps clearly make (Xs , \u03b1s,t )s,t\u2208S a directed system\nindexed by S op . Now because S has empty intersection, we see that at each\nE \u2208 Ob(E), the sets Xs (E) become singletons for sufficiently large s \u2208 S op ,\nso lim S op Xs is an E-set all of whose components are singletons; hence the set\n\u2212\u2192\nlim E (lim S op Xs ) is a singleton.\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nOn the other hand, for each s \u2208 S we can construct (at least) two distinct elements of lim E Xs ; an element x+ which takes value +1 at every E belonging\n\u2190\u2212\nto s (and, necessarily, value 0 at all other E), and an element x\u2212 which takes\nvalue \u22121 at all E belonging to s. The maps lim E \u03b1s,t : lim E Xs \u2192 lim E Xt\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n(s \u2287 t) take x+ to x+ and x\u2212 to x\u2212 ; thus we get distinct elements x+ and\nx\u2212 in lim S op (lim E Xs ). Hence the map (20) cannot be one-to-one.\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\nThe final assertion of the proposition is proved by a construction exactly\nlike the preceding, with \u2205 used in place of {\u22121, +1}. In that case we get\nlim S op (lim E Xs ) empty, and lim E (lim S op Xs ) again a singleton, so that (20)\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nis not surjective. \u2737\n\nTo formulate a criterion for (20) to be bijective for all directed systems of Esets, let us define a congruence C on an E-set X to be a family (CE )E\u2208Ob(E) ,\n15\n\n\fwhere each CE is an equivalence relation on X(E), and which is functorial,\nin the sense that\n(26)\n\n(s, t) \u2208 CE , a \u2208 E(E, F ) =\u21d2 (X(a)(s), X(a)(t)) \u2208 CF .\n\nIf, more generally, we define a \"binary relation\" R on an E-set X to mean a\nfamily R = (RE )E\u2208Ob(E) , where each RE is a binary relation on X(E), and\nno functoriality is assumed, then for every such relation R we can define the\ncongruence generated by R to be the least congruence C such that for each\nE \u2208 Ob(E), RE \u2286 CE . It is not hard to verify a more explicit description\nfor this congruence C : for each E \u2208 Ob(E), CE is the equivalence relation\non X(E) generated by the union, over all F \u2208 Ob(E) and a \u2208 E(F, E), of\nthe image in X(E) \u00d7 X(E) of RF \u2286 X(F ) \u00d7 X(F ) under X(a) \u00d7 X(a). We\nwill call a congruence on X finitely generated if it is generated by a binary\nP\nrelation R such that E\u2208Ob(E) card(RE ) < \u221e. (Since we cannot assume the\nS\nsets X(E) disjoint, it is not sufficient to say that card( RE ) is finite.) The\nimproper congruence on an E-set X will mean the congruence whose value at\neach E is the improper equivalence relation on X(E).\nFor any object E of E, the covariant hom-functor E(E, \u2212) : E \u2192 Set may\nbe regarded as an E-set, which we will denote HE . Since we have assumed that\ndistinct pairs of objects have disjoint hom-sets, these E-sets will be disjoint,\nand we can form the union of any set of them. We can now state and prove\nTheorem 5 Let E be a small category satisfying (25), and A a finite set of\nobjects of E as in that condition, i.e., such that every object of E admits at\nS\nleast one morphism from an object of A. Let H denote the E-set E\u2208A HE .\nThen the following conditions are equivalent:\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nFor every directed partially ordered set I and directed system\n(Xi , \u03b1i,j )i,j\u2208I of E-sets, the set-map \u03b9: lim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ) \u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\nlim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ) of (20) is bijective.\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nThe improper congruence on H is finitely generated.\n\nPROOF. Since (25) is equivalent to injectivity of the maps (20), what we\nmust prove is that under that assumption, surjectivity of all such maps is\nequivalent to (28).\nFirst assume (28), and suppose we are given a directed system (Xi )i\u2208I of Esets, and an element x = (xE ) \u2208 lim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ). Each coordinate xE of x\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\ncan be written \u03b1jE ,\u221e (yE ), where jE \u2208 I is an index depending on E, and\nyE \u2208 XjE (E). We shall only use finitely many of these elements, namely those\nwith E \u2208 A. By the directedness of I we can find an index j that majorizes\nall the jE with E \u2208 A; we thus get a family of elements of Xj , namely\n16\n\n\fyE\u2032 = \u03b1jE ,j (yE ) \u2208 Xj (E) (E \u2208 A). These will generate a sub-E-set Y \u2286 Xj ,\nwhose F -component, for each F \u2208 Ob(E), consists of all elements Xj (a)(yE\u2032 )\n(E \u2208 A, a \u2208 E(E, F )).\nLet us map the E-set H = E\u2208A HE onto Y by sending each a \u2208 HE (F ) =\nE(E, F ) (where E \u2208 A, F \u2208 Ob(E)) to Xj (a)(yE\u2032 ) \u2208 Xj (F ). (This can be\nthought of as an application of Yoneda's Lemma to each of the sub-E-sets HE\n(E \u2208 A) of H.)\nS\n\nBy choice of the yE , the image in lim i\u2208I Xi of the sub-E-set Y \u2286 Xj has in\n\u2212\u2192\neach coordinate F only a single element, namely xF . Thus by applying the\nmorphism \u03b1j,k for large enough k, we can make any given pair of elements in\nany coordinate fall together. But the fact that Y is an image of H and that\nthe improper congruence on H is finitely generated means that some finite\nfamily of these collapses imply all of them. Thus, we can find some k \u2265 j\nsuch that the image of Y in Xk has just one element in each coordinate. The\nOb(E)-tuple of elements of Xk so determined will be an element z \u2208 lim E Xk\n\u2190\u2212\nwhich maps to x in lim E (lim i\u2208I Xi ). Taking the image of this element z in\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nlim i\u2208I (lim E Xi ) we get an element of the latter set that maps to x under \u03b9,\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\nproving (27).\nThe proof of the converse will also follow that of the corresponding result for\nmonoid actions, though this time the \"hiccup\" will involve adjoining card(A)\nadditional pairs, rather than just one, to a certain finitely generated congruence. Assuming (27), let I be the directed partially ordered set of all finitely\ngenerated congruences on H, and for each C \u2208 I, let XC be the E-set H/C.\nThen we see that lim C\u2208I XC is an E-set with just one element in each compo\u2212\u2192\nnent, hence lim E (lim C\u2208I XC ) is a singleton. Hence by (27) the same is true of\n\u2190\u2212 \u2212\u2192\nlim C\u2208I (lim E XC ), so least one of the sets lim E XC (C \u2208 I) is nonempty. Say\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\nx = (xE ) \u2208 lim E XC for some C \u2208 I. For each E \u2208 Ob(E) the element xE\n\u2190\u2212\nwill be the C-congruence class [aE ] of some element aE \u2208 E(FE , E) \u2286 H(E),\nwhere FE \u2208 A. If for every F \u2208 A we adjoin to C the additional pair\n(idF , aF ), we get a congruence C \u2032 on H which is still finitely generated, and\nwhich I claim is the improper congruence. Indeed, the compatibility conditions (18), which by assumption hold for the components xE = [aE ] of x,\nnow hold also for all translates [a] (a \u2208 E(F, E)) of the images [idF ] of the\ngenerators idF of H. This establishes (28). \u2737\n\nThe following terminology provides a useful way of looking at this result.\nDefinition 6 Let E be a small category. By the trivial E-set we will mean the\nfunctor T that associates to every object of E a 1-element set  \u030a\n(with the only\n \u030a\n \u030a\npossible behavior on morphisms). If E satisfies (25) and (for H constructed\nas in Theorem 5 from a set A as in (25)), also (28), we will say that the\n17\n\n\ftrivial E-set is finitely presented.\nNote that for T the trivial E-set defined above, and X any E-set, the set\nlim E X can be identified with the hom-set SetE (T, X). From this point of\n\u2190\u2212\nview, Theorem 5 is an instance of the general observation that for an algebraic\nstructure S (in this case, T ), the covariant hom-functor determined by S\nrespects direct limits if and only if S is finitely presented.\n(We have, for simplicity, not defined the general concept of a presentation\nof an E-set. Briefly, this may be done as follows. A representable functor\nHE (E \u2208 Ob(E)) can be considered an E-set X \"free on one generator in\nX(E)\", namely idE . A disjoint union of E-sets of this form (with repetitions\nallowed), modulo the congruence generated by a given set of ordered pairs, can\nbe regarded as the E-set presented using the images of the elements idE \u2208 HE\nas generators and the given ordered pairs as relations. Incidentally, the reader\nmay have noted that Definition 6 has the formal defect that the condition on\nE as stated depends on the choice of A. But Theorem 5 shows that it is in\nfact independent of A; and, indeed, for E-sets as for other finitary algebraic\nobjects, if an object is finitely generated, one can show that the property of\nfinite relatedness is independent of one's choice of finite generating set.)\nThough Theorem 5 is elegant, it does not give convenient conditions analogous\nto (9)-(13) of Theorem 2. These, too, may be generalized to arbitrary small\ncategories E, but the statements are simplest when E has only finitely many\nobjects. I will develop the generalization of (13) to that case below, and at the\nend of the next section will state and sketch the proof of the corresponding\nresult for general E.\nLet us call a subcategory E0 of a category E right division-closed if for any\ntwo morphisms a, b of E whose composite ab is defined, we have\n(29)\n\nab, b \u2208 E0 =\u21d2 a \u2208 E0 .\n\nProposition 7 Let E be a category with only finitely many objects. Then the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\n(30)\n(31)\n\nE satisfies the equivalent conditions of Theorem 5.\nThere exists a finite set S of morphisms of E, such that the\nsmallest subcategory E0 of E which has the same object-set as E,\nand contains S, and is right division-closed in E, is E itself.\n\nPROOF. Assuming (30), take for A as in Theorem 5 the full object-set of E,\nso that H is the union of the E-sets HE associated with all the objects of E,\nand let R be a finite generating set for the improper congruence on H. Let S\n18\n\n\fbe the set of all elements occurring as first or second components of members\nof R, and let E0 \u2286 E be constructed from S as in (31). Let U be the set of all\npairs (as, at) with s \u2208 E0 (E, F ), t \u2208 E0 (E \u2032 , F ), a \u2208 E(F, G), E, E \u2032 , F, G \u2208\nOb(E). As in the last paragraph of the proof of Theorem 2, each element\nof U either has both components or neither component in E0 . Hence the\nequivalence relation C generated by U also has this property. Moreover, U,\nand hence C, is closed under left composition with morphisms of E, hence C\nis a congruence on H, and it contains all members of the generating set R,\nhence it is the improper congruence. Now for every morphism a \u2208 E(E, F )\nof E, the improper congruence on H contains (idF , a), and idF \u2208 E0 , hence\nby our \"both or neither\" property of C, a \u2208 E0 . So E0 = E, proving (31).\nConversely, suppose S is a finite set of morphisms for which the conclusion\nof (31) holds, and consider the congruence C on H generated by all pairs\n(a, idF ) where a \u2208 S \u2229 E(E, F ) (E, F \u2208 Ob(E)).\nFor each E, F \u2208 Ob(E), let E1 (E, F ) denote {a \u2208 E(E, F ) | (a, idF ) \u2208 C}.\nI claim this gives the morphism-set of a right division closed subcategory\nE1 \u2286 E with object-set Ob(E). It is immediate that it contains all identity\nmorphisms; now suppose a: F \u2192 G and b: E \u2192 F are morphisms of E, with\nb \u2208 E1 . The latter relation means (b, idF ) \u2208 C, hence as C is a congruence,\nwe also have (ab, a) \u2208 C, hence (ab, idG ) \u2208 C \u21d0\u21d2 (a, idG ) \u2208 C, i.e., ab \u2208\nE1 \u21d0\u21d2 a \u2208 E1 , proving both closure under composition and right division\nclosure. Hence since S was chosen as in (31), E1 must be all of E. This\nsays that C contains all pairs (a, idF ) with a \u2208 E(E, F ), E, F \u2208 Ob(E), so\nby transitivity, C is the improper congruence on H, which is thus finitely\ngenerated, proving (30). \u2737\n\n6\n\nDigression: four corollaries.\n\nA case of Proposition 7 which has been noted before is\nCorollary 8 ( = [1, Prop. 7.9.3], cf. [15, Thm. IX.2.1, p.211], [12, Thm. 4.73, p.72])\nIf E is a category with only finitely many objects, and whose morphism-set\nis finitely generated under composition, then on directed systems (Xi )i\u2208I of\nE-sets, the operations lim E and lim I commute; i.e., (27) holds. \u2737\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\nThis note is in fact the result of pondering how to improve on the above\nresult from [1]. (Incidentally, in the statement in [1], I assumed the category\nE nonempty, but allowed direct limits over possibly empty directed partially\nordered sets. In this note I have made the opposite choices, requiring in the\ndefinition that direct limits have nonempty index sets, but not so restricting\nE. As observed in [1, Exercise 7.9:2], the result holds if either the category or\n19\n\n\fthe directed partially ordered set is required to be nonempty, but fails when\nthey are both empty.)\nLet us record next a pair of results implicit in the proofs of Theorem 2 and\nProposition 7, along with their duals. (The proofs, and that of the final result\nof this section, will just be sketched; they will not be used in the remainder\nof this note.) We will use for monoids as well as for categories the term \"right\ndivision-closed\" introduced above, and define \"left division-closed\" for both\nsorts of structures dually. (The terms used by semigroup theorists, e.g. in\n[4,18], are \"left, respectively, right unital\", though in [7], where the conditions\nwere first introduced, they were \"left, respectively, right simplifiable\".) For\na an element of a monoid M and Y0 a subset of an M-set Y, we shall in\nCorollary 9(iii*) write a\u22121 Y0 for the inverse image of Y0 \u2286 Y under the map\nY \u2192 Y given by the action of a; and we shall similarly use inverse image\nnotation in Corollary 10(iii*) in connection with the set-maps Y (a) forming\nthe structure of an E-set Y. Note that in Corollary 9(iii*), \"M-set\" still means\nleft M-set, despite the dualization being carried out.\nThe first half of the next result is due to Schein [18, Theorem 2].\nCorollary 9 (to proof of Theorem 2; cf. [18]) Let M be a monoid, and N a\nsubset of M. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) N is a right division-closed submonoid of M.\n(ii) N is the equivalence class of 1 under some left congruence on M.\n(iii) There exist an M-set X, and an element x \u2208 X, such that N =\n{a \u2208 M | ax = x}.\nLikewise, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i*) N is a left division-closed submonoid of M.\n(ii*) N is the equivalence class of 1 under some right congruence on M.\n(iii*) There exist an M-set Y, and a subset Y0 of Y, such that N =\n{a \u2208 M | a\u22121 Y0 = Y0 }.  \u030a\n(I.e., N is the set of elements a \u2208 M which carry\nboth Y0 and its complement into themselves. \u030a\n)\n\nSketch of proof. Assuming (i), let C be the equivalence relation on M\ngenerated by {(as, at) | a \u2208 M, s, t \u2208 N}, and observe as in the proof of\nTheorem 2, (17) =\u21d2 (13), that C is a congruence and relates elements of N\nonly with elements in N, establishing (ii). The implications (ii) =\u21d2 (iii) =\u21d2\n(i) are straightforward.\n20\n\n\fThe second half of the result will follow from the first by left-right dualization\nif we can establish that (iii*) is equivalent to the existence of a right M-set\nX with an element x such that N = {a \u2208 M | xa = x}. Now given a\nleft M-set Y and a subset Y0 such that N = {a \u2208 M | a\u22121 Y0 = Y0 }, the\ncontravariant power functor yields a right M-set X = P(Y ), in which the\nelement x = Y0 indeed satisfies N = {a \u2208 M | xa = x}. Conversely, given a\nright M-set X with an element x satisfying this relation, it is easy to verify\nthat in the left M-set Y = P(X), the subset Y0 = {S \u2286 X | x \u2208 S} satisfies\nN = {a \u2208 M | a\u22121 Y0 = Y0 }. \u2737\n\nWe can now see the significance of condition (13) in Theorem 2. Although,\nas noted at the beginning of \u00a74, a general left congruence on a monoid is not\ndetermined by the set of elements congruent to 1, the improper left congruence\nis clearly determined by that set. Condition (13) translates finite generation\nof the improper left congruence into finite generation of M as a set that can\noccur as the equivalence class of 1 under a left congruence.\nThe analogous result for small categories is\nCorollary 10 (to proof of Proposition 7) Let E be a small category, and for\nevery pair of objects E, F \u2208 Ob(E) let E0 (E, F ) be a subset of E(E, F ). Then\nthe following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) The sets E0 (E, F ) are the morphism-sets of a right division-closed subcategory E0 \u2286 E with the same object-set as E.\n(ii) There exists a congruence C on the E-set E\u2208Ob(E) HE , such that for all\nE, F \u2208 Ob(E), E0 (E, F ) = {a \u2208 E(E, F ) | (a, 1F ) \u2208 C}.\nS\n\n(iii) There exist an E -set X, and for each E \u2208 Ob(E) an element xE \u2208\nX(E), such that for all E, F \u2208 Ob(E), E0 (E, F ) = {a \u2208 E(E, F ) | axE =\nxF }.\nLikewise, the following conditions are equivalent  \u030a\n(where for E \u2208 Ob(E), H E\ndenotes the contravariant hom functor E(\u2212, E)) :\n(i*) The sets E0 (E, F ) are the morphism-sets of a left division-closed subcategory E0 \u2286 E with the same object-set as E.\n(ii*) There exists a congruence C on the right E-set  \u030a\n(contravariant SetS\nE\n \u030a\nvalued functor) E\u2208Ob(E) H such that for all E, F \u2208 Ob(E), E0 (E, F ) =\n{a \u2208 E(E, F ) | (a, 1E ) \u2208 C}.\n(iii*) There exist a  \u030a\n(left \u030a\n) E -set Y, and for each E \u2208 Ob(E) a subset Y0 (E) \u2286\nY (E), such that for all E, F \u2208 Ob(E), E0 (E, F ) = {a \u2208 E(E, F ) |\n21\n\n\fY (a)\u22121 Y0 (F ) = Y0 (E)}.\n\nSketch of proof. Analogous to the proof of Corollary 9. So, for instance, to\nget (i) =\u21d2 (ii), we use E0 as in the proof of Proposition 7 to construct on H\na binary relation U, and from that, the congruence C. \u2737\n\nSince this relation between right division-closed subcategories and congruences\non H holds for arbitrary E, why does Theorem 5 need the hypothesis that E\nhave only finitely many objects? Because when it has infinitely many objects,\nS\nthe E-set E\u2208Ob(E) HE is not finitely generated, so the statement that its\nquotient by the improper congruence is finitely presented does not mean that\nthe latter congruence is finitely generated. However, with this viewpoint in\nmind, one can come up with a generalization of that theorem to arbitrary E.\nCorollary 11 (to Theorem 5 and proof of Proposition 7) Let E be a small\ncategory satisfying (25), and A a finite set of objects of E as in that condition. Let S0 be a set of morphisms of E which, for each F \u2208 Ob(E) \u2212 A,\ncontains exactly one morphism from a member of A to F, and which contains\nno elements other than these. Then E satisfies the equivalent conditions of\nTheorem 5 if and only if it satisfies\n(32)\n\nThere exists a finite set S1 of morphisms of E such that the\nsmallest subcategory E0 of E which has the same object-set as E,\nand contains S0 \u222aS1 , and is right division-closed in E, is E itself.\n\nSketch of proof. (32) is equivalent to the statement that the pairs (a, idF ),\nwhere a \u2208 S0 \u222a S1 and F is the codomain of a, generate the improper\nS\ncongruence on E\u2208Ob(E) HE . Now those pairs with a taken from S0 simply\nS\nserve to \"eliminate\" the generators idF of E\u2208Ob(E) HE with F \u2208 Ob(E) \u2212A;\ni.e., dividing out by the congruence generated by those pairs alone gives the\nE-set H of Theorem 5. Thus, (32) is equivalent to the statement that the\nimproper congruence on that E-set is generated by a finite set of pairs, which\nis the desired condition (28).\nTo set up a formal proof, for each F \u2208 Ob(E) \u2212 A, let aF \u2208 E(EF , F )\n(where EF \u2208 A) be the corresponding element of S0 , while for F \u2208 A let\nus set EF = F, aF = idF . Then given S1 as in (32), one shows that the\nimproper congruence on H is generated by the finite set of pairs (baF , aF \u2032 )\nfor b : F \u2192 F \u2032 in S1 , while conversely, given a finite generating set R for\nthat improper congruence, one can take S1 to be the set of components of\nmembers of R. \u2737\n22\n\n\fAn easy class of examples are categories E having an initial object Einit . Then\nif one takes A = {Einit }, there is a unique set S0 as in the statement of the\nabove theorem, and letting S1 be the empty set, one finds that (32) holds.\n\n7\n\nPosets.\n\nGroups and monoids, with which we began this note, are categories where \"all\nthe structure is in the morphisms\", and essentially none in the class of objects\nand the way morphisms connect them. In this section we will consider the\nopposite extreme, the case of partially ordered sets J regarded as categories.\nIf J is a poset, we shall write E = Jcat for the category having for objects the\nelements of J, and having, for each E, F \u2208 J, one morphism \u03bb(E, F ) : E \u2192 F\nif E \u2264 F, and no morphisms E \u2192 F otherwise. (We write E, F, . . . for\nelements of J for consistency with the notation of the last two sections.)\nFrom Proposition 4 we know that a necessary condition for limits over such\na category E to respect direct limits is that the set A of minimal elements\nof J be finite, and every element of J lie above an element of A. Note that\nthe E-set H constructed as in Theorem 5 from this set A associates to each\nE \u2208 J the set {\u03bb(F, E) | F \u2208A, F \u2264 E}. By that theorem, to strengthen our\nnecessary condition to a necessary and sufficient one, we need to know for\nwhich J the improper congruence on this E-set H is finitely generated.\nFor an instructive example of an infinite poset for which this congruence is\nfinitely generated, let the underlying set of J consist of all real numbers \u2265 1,\nordered in the usual way, together with two elements 01 and 02 which are less\nthan all other elements, and mutually incomparable. Thus, A = {01 , 02}, and\nfor all E other than these two elements, we have H(E) = {\u03bb(01 , E), \u03bb(02, E)}.\nIt is easy to see that the improper congruence on H is generated by the single\npair (\u03bb(01 , 1), \u03bb(02, 1)). On the other hand, if we delete the element 1 and\nconsider the corresponding functor on (J \u2212 {1})cat , it is not hard to see that\nthe improper congruence on this functor is no longer finitely generated.\nThe element 1 \u2208 J is what we shall call a \"critical element\" with respect to\nthe subset {01 , 02 }. In the example above, it served to \"gather\" the strands of\nH emanating from 01 and 02 . Let us give precise meanings to these terms.\nDefinition 12 Let J be a partially ordered set. For E \u2208 J we shall write\ndown(E) for {F \u2208 J | F \u2264 E}  \u030a\n(the \"principal downset\" generated by E).\nGiven E \u2208 J and subsets A, B \u2286 J, we shall write R(A, B, E) for the\nequivalence relation on A \u2229 down(E) generated by the union over all F \u2208 B \u2229\n23\n\n\fdown(E) of the improper equivalence relations on the sets A \u2229 down(F ). We\nshall say that B gathers A under E if R(A, B, E) is the improper equivalence\nrelation on A \u2229 down(E).\nGiven a subset A \u2286 J and an element E \u2208 J, we note that {E} always\ngathers A under E. We shall call E A-critical if J \u2212 {E} does not gather\nA under E.\nIt is straightforward to verify the transitivity relation\n(33)\n\nIf A, B1 , B2 are subsets of J and E an element of J, such that\nB1 gathers A under every element of B2 and B2 gathers A under\nE, then B1 gathers A under E.\n\nAlso, the next-to-last sentence of Definition 12 implies the reflexivity condition:\n(34)\n\nIf A, B are subsets of J, then B gathers A under every E \u2208 B.\n\nNote that in the next lemma, we do not assume that every element of J\nmajorizes some member of A (though we will add that assumption when we\napply the lemma).\nLemma 13 Let J be a partially ordered set and A \u2286 J a finite subset. Let\nus write E for Jcat , and H for the union, over all E \u2208 A, of the covariant\nhom-functors HE . Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(35)\n\nThere exists a finite subset B \u2286 J which gathers A under every\nE \u2208 J.\n\n(36)\n\nThe set of A-critical elements of J is finite, and gathers A under\nevery E \u2208 J.\n\n(37)\n\nThe improper congruence on the E-set H is finitely generated.\n\nPROOF. (36) =\u21d2 (35) is immediate. To get the converse, take B as in (35)\nand let B \u2032 denote the set of A-critical elements of J. Applying (35) to an\nelement E \u2208 B \u2032 , we see, from the definition of the statement that E is Acritical, that E \u2208 B. Hence B \u2032 \u2286 B, so in particular B \u2032 is finite; it remains to\nshow that for any E \u2208 J, B \u2032 gathers A under E. In doing so we may assume\ninductively that B \u2032 gathers A under every F \u2208 J such that the number of\nelements of B that are < F is smaller than the number that are < E, or\nsuch that these numbers are equal but the number \u2264 F is smaller than the\nnumber \u2264 E.\nIf E \u2208\n/ B, the former assumption shows that B \u2032 gathers A under each element\n24\n\n\fof B \u2229 down(E), hence (33), with B \u2032 and B \u2229 down(E) in the roles of B1\nand B2 , shows that B \u2032 gathers A under E, as desired. On the other hand,\nif E \u2208 B, the inductive assumptions show that B \u2032 gathers A under every\nelement of J that is < E. Now if E is not A-critical, we can apply (33) with\nB \u2032 and down(E) \u2212 {E} in the roles of B1 and B2 respectively, and again\nconclude that B \u2032 gathers A under E. On the other hand, if E is A-critical,\nthen it belongs to B \u2032 , and (34) (with B \u2032 in the role of B) yields the same\nconclusion.\n(35) \u21d0\u21d2 (37): Note that for any E \u2208 J, the definition of H(E) shows that\nthis set is in bijective correspondence with down(E) \u2229 A, via \u03bb(A, E) 7\u2192 A,\nand that for any set B, the equivalence relation R(A, B, E) on down(E) \u2229 A\ncorresponds to the restriction to H(E) of the congruence generated by the improper equivalence relations on the sets H(F ) (F \u2208 B \u2229 down(E)). It follows\nthat given B as in (35), the improper congruence on H is generated by the\nfinite set of pairs {(\u03bb(F, E), \u03bb(F \u2032, E)) | E \u2208 B; F, F \u2032 \u2208 A \u2229 down(E)}. Conversely, assuming (37), we may take a finite generating set S for the improper\ncongruence on H and let B = {E | (\u2203 F, F \u2032 \u2208 A) (\u03bb(F, E), \u03bb(F \u2032, E)) \u2208 S},\nand we see that this B witnesses (35). \u2737\nThe above lemma, combined with Theorem 5, yields necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a category of the form Jcat to have the property we are interested in (last paragraph of theorem below). We can also get from it some\nnecessary conditions for this to be true of an arbitrary small category (first\nparagraph).\nTheorem 14 Let E be a small category, and J the partially ordered set\nwhose elements are the equivalence classes of objects of E under the equivalence relation that relates E and F if there exist morphisms from E to\nF and from F to E  \u030a\n(cf. proof of Proposition 4 \u030a\n). Let A denote the set of\nminimal elements of J, and B the set of A-critical elements. Then necessary\nconditions for limits over E to respect direct limits of E-sets are (i) A is\nfinite, (ii) every element of J lies above an element of A, (iii) B is finite,\nand (iv) B gathers A under every element of J.\nIf E is in fact a category formed from a partially ordered set by the construction ( )cat  \u030a\n(equivalently, if E \u223c\n= Jcat ), then the conjunction of these four\nconditions is sufficient as well as necessary.\nPROOF. The final assertion is immediate from Proposition 4, Theorem 5,\nand Lemma 13.\nTo get the assertion of the first paragraph, suppose that limits over E respect\ndirect limits of E-sets. Conditions (i) and (ii) follow from Proposition 4. Let\n25\n\n\fus write the set of minimal elements of J more distinctively as A(J) , let\nA(E) \u2286 Ob(E) be a set of representatives of these elements, and let H (Jcat) and\nH (E) denote the Jcat -set and the E-set determined by these respective sets of\nobjects. Then by Theorem 5 our assumption implies that the trivial congruence\non H (E) is finitely generated, while by Lemma 13, the conclusions (iii) and (iv)\nthat we want to prove are equivalent to saying that the same is true of the\ntrivial congruence on H (Jcat ) .\nNow there is an obvious functor R : E \u2192 Jcat taking each object of E\nto its equivalence class in J. It is easy to see that the composite functor\nH (Jcat) \u25e6R : E \u2192 Jcat \u2192 Set admits a surjective homomorphism H (E) \u2192\nH (Jcat) \u25e6R; hence as the improper congruence on H (E) is finitely generated,\nthe same is true of the improper congruence on H (Jcat) \u25e6R, and hence, as R is\nsurjective on objects, of the improper congruence on H (Jcat) , as required. \u2737\n\n8\n\nRemarks\n\nAs noted in the introduction, given a directed system of algebras (Ai )I , understood to be finitary, one can construct its direct limit by taking the direct\nlimit of underlying sets and putting an appropriate algebra structure on this\nset, essentially because direct limits respect finite products of sets, and an\nalgebra structure is given by maps on such product sets. On the other hand,\ndirect limits do not in general respect infinite products; indeed, such a product can be thought of as a limit over Jcat where J is an infinite antichain,\nand such a J does not satisfy condition (i) of Theorem 14. So direct limits of\ninfinitary algebras cannot be constructed as in the finitary case. An example\nis\nExample 15 A directed system of algebras with one \u05d00-ary operation, such\nthat the algebra structure cannot be extended to the direct limit set in any\nnatural way.\n\nDetails. For each positive real number a let Aa be the closed interval [0, a] \u2286\nR, given with the \u05d00-ary supremum operation (x0 , x1 , . . . ) 7\u2192 sup(x0 , x1 , . . . ).\nThese sets form a directed system under inclusion, but the operation sup\nclearly does not extend in a natural way to their direct limit, [0, \u221e). For\ninstance, one has no natural definition of sup(0, 1, 2, . . . ), because the map\n\u03b9 : lim a\u2208R (ANa ) \u2192 (lim a\u2208R Aa )N does not have (0, 1, 2, . . . ) in its image. It is\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nnot hard to show that no extension of sup to [0, \u221e) makes this set the direct\nlimit of the algebras Aa . (The uncountability of R is not necessary to this\nexample; one may replace R with N. I just felt that the supremum function\non real numbers was the more \"important\" example.)\n26\n\n\fWe also noted in the introduction that the results of this paper are specific to Set-valued functors, and fail for functors with other codomains, e.g.,\nSetop . For another example, let Metr be the category of metric spaces, with\ndistance-nonincreasing maps as morphisms. Then one has\nExample 16 A directed system of Z2-sets X0 \u2192 X1 \u2192 * * * , in Metr such\nthat the map \u03b9 : lim i (Xi )Z2 \u2192 (lim i Xi )Z2 is not surjective.\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nDetails. For each i, let Xi be the set {0, 1}, with d(0, 1) = 1/(i + 1), and\nwith Z2 acting by switching 0 and 1, and let all connecting morphisms be the\nidentity on underlying sets. Each of the sets XiZ2 is empty, so lim I XiZ2 = \u2205.\n\u2212\u2192\nHowever, from the metric space axiom d(x, y) = 0 =\u21d2 x = y one sees that\nthe direct limit of this directed system is the 1-point metric space, on which\nZ2 acts trivially; thus, (lim I Xi )Z2 is nonempty.\n\u2212\u2192\nA type of question related to that considered in this note arises in sheaf theory. A sheaf of sets on a topological space V is a certain sort of functor\n(o(V )op )cat \u2192 Set, where o(V ) is the set of open subsets of V, partially ordered by inclusion; and an analog of the question we have considered is, \"When\ndoes the global-sections functor commute with direct limits of sheaves?\" But\nthat problem is not actually a case of the problem considered above, because\nof the nontrivial form that the direct limit construction takes for sheaves. A\nclass of situations where that commutativity holds is obtained in [10, Exercise II.1.11], and in greater generality in [9, Proposition 3.6.3].\n\nReferences\n[1] George M.
