In particular, vortices in different components undergo separate, but concentric, orbits for both same and opposite circulation. In\naddition, contrary to the well\u2013known behavior in single\u2013component condensates, vortices with the\nsame circulation created in the less dense component merge in the presence of dissipation, allowing\nfor the creation of metastable vortices with more than one quantum of circulation.\n\nThe experimental achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in trapped dilute alkali gases [1] has\nopened the possibility to explore fundamental properties\nof low temperature physics in a very controllable way. In\nparticular, superfluid phenomena, well known from 4 He\nphysics [2], have been experimentally observed in BEC\n[3]. Among the phenomena related with superfluidity,\nthe possibility of vortices with quantized circulation [4]\nhas aroused a big interest. Due to the diluteness of the\natomic condensates, accurate theoretical predictions are\npossible. In addition, in these systems, the diameter of\nthe vortex core is typically three orders of magnitude\nlarger than for superfluid Helium, allowing for a more\nstraightforward optical observation. Numerous theoretical schemes have been suggested for generating vortices\nin BEC, see e.g. Refs. [5\u201311]. So far only two techniques have successfully generated vortices in condensates, namely the stirring with a blue detuned laser [12],\nand the coherent interconversion between the two components of a binary BEC [13]. In addition the creation of\na vortex ring after the decay of a dark soliton has been\nrecently reported [14]. The dynamics and stability of vortices in trapped Bose\u2013Einstein condensates has recently\nalso been a subject of active investigation [15].\nIn the recent years, the development of trapping techniques has allowed for the creation of multi-component\ncondensates, which are formed by trapping atoms in different internal (electronic) states [16,17]. The multicomponent BEC, far from being a trivial extension of the\nsingle\u2013component one, presents novel and fundamentally\ndifferent scenarios for its ground state [18,19] and excitations [20]. In particular, it has been observed that the\ncondensate can reach an equilibrium state characterized\nby the separation of the species in different domains [17].\nThe realization of vortices in binary condensates in recent experiments at JILA [13] has aroused the interest for\nthe properties of vortices in multicomponent condensates\n[15,21,22]. Several interesting phenomena have been reported in this context, such as vortex ground states [23]\nand generation of persistent currents [22].\nIn this Letter we discuss the interaction of vortices in\n\na two\u2013component BEC. The first part of the Letter is devoted to homogeneous miscible binary condensates. We\nconsider in particular the case in which one vortex is created in each component. In single\u2013component BEC (or\nclassical gas) in absence of dissipation, two vortices with\nthe same circulation orbit around each other, whereas\nvortices with opposite circulation move parallelly (vortex\npair) [4]. However, for the case of asymmetric nonlinear interactions between the two components of a binary\nBEC, the velocity fields for the vortices are asymmetric.\nWe show that in this scenario, vortices with the same\ncirculation perform two concentric orbits. Interestingly,\nalso vortices with opposite circulation perform concentric\norbits, clearly differing from the one component behavior.\nIn the second part of this Letter we analyze the interaction of two vortices created in one of the components of\nan inhomogeneous binary BEC. In particular, we study\nthe interaction of vortices with the same circulation, and\nshow that the \"buoyancy\" effect [22] strongly distorts\nthe vortex dynamics. In single\u2013component BEC, vortices\nwith the same circulation repel each other in the presence\nof dissipation, whereas the opposite can be true in a two\u2013\ncomponent BEC. This result strongly suggests that the\ncreation of stable vortices with more than one quantum\nof circulation should be possible in a binary BEC.\nLet us first consider the case of one vortex created in\neach of the components of a miscible binary BEC trapped\nin a 2D disc\u2013shape box\u2013like potential of radius R. The\nBEC can be considered homogeneous, except in a region of the size of the healing length, close to the box\nboundaries. The dynamics can be described in 2D if the\nmean\u2013field interaction is smaller than the typical energy\nseparation E\u22a5 in the third direction [25]. To generate\nthe vortices we use the phase\u2013imprinting (PI) technique\n[9], although other methods could be employed, as for\nexample stirring methods [12], or the method employed\nin Ref. [13], which already involves two components.\nFor sufficiently low temperatures the dynamics is well\ndescribed by two coupled Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equations\n\u001a\nh\u03042 2\n\u2202\n\u2207 + V (r) + gjj |\u03c8j (r, t)|2 +\nih\u0304 \u03c8j (r, t) = \u2212\n\u2202t\n2m\n1\n\n\fgjl |\u03c8l (r, t)|2 \u03c8j (r, t),\n\nvortices with the same circulation. In this asymmetric\nscenario, contrary to the case of single\u2013component vortices, vortices with the same circulation do not undergo\nan orbit, but two concentric ones. The inner orbit corresponds to the vortex in the denser component, whereas\nthe outer one corresponds to the vortex created in the less\ndense one. Interestingly, such a behavior is also present\nfor the case of vortices with opposite circulation.\nIn order to understand the formation of the planetary\norbits when n1 6= n2 , let us consider the situation of a\nvortex line in the component 1 (2) at a position ~r1 (~r2 ).\nThe density of the component 1 (2) is considered constant\nand equal to n1 (n2 ) everywhere in the system, except\nin the core of the vortices, which will be modeled as a\ncylinder of radius l1 (l2 ). In the core of the vortex in the\ncomponent 1 (2) the density of 1 (2) is considered zero,\nwhereas the density of 2 (1) is considered n1 + n2 , in\nsuch a way that the total density is flat. In the following\ncalculation, we shall assume that |~r1 |, |~r2 | \u226a R, i.e. the\nvortices are placed close to the trap center, and the vortex\ncores are far away from each other, l1 , l2 \u226a |~r2 \u2212~r1 | = |~r|.\nThe conservation of linear momentum and energy in the\nsystem, up to order O((rj /R)2 ), O((lj /r)2 ), (j = 1, 2),\nlead respectively to the following equations:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0013\n~r * ~u\nn2 l22 + \u03ban1 l12\n~u \u2212 2\n~r ,\n(2)\nn1 ~u1 + \u03ban2 ~u2 =\nr2\nr2\n\u0010 r \u00112\nn2 l2 + n1 l12\n(n1~r1 * ~u1 + n2~r2 * ~u2 ) = \u2212 2 2\n(~r * ~u), (3)\nR\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V (r) is the trap potential, gjl = 4\u03c0h\u03042 ajl /mL is the\ncoupling constant (averaged over the frozen\u2013out transversal direction) between the components j and l with the\ntransversal length L, m is the atomic mass and ajl the\nscattering length between j and l (j, l = 1, 2).\nWe have numerically simulated the creation of one vortex in each component by using PI. The creation of a vortex in one component modifies the density in the other\none, due to the coupling in Eq. (1). For example, dark\nsolitons in homogeneous two-component BEC can only\nbe created at distances comparable to the healing length\n\u221a\n[26], l0 = h\u0304/ gnm, where n is the density of the sample. The latter does not apply to vortices, which can be\ncreated at distances significantly larger than l0 , without\nbeing destroyed by the density fluctuations of the other\ncomponent. Although we have numerically observed stable creation of vortices at distances larger than 20l0 , typical distances of the order of 8l0 are used in the simulations\nbelow, since the time scale of the vortex\u2013vortex dynamics\nis given by md2 /h\u0304, where d is the distance between the\nvortices. Therefore shorter distances allow for faster dynamics. This facilitates the numerical simulations, and\nreduces instabilities during the vortex interaction. As already observed in recent experiments [13], the vortex core\nin one component is filled by the other component. Although the two components interact through the density,\nand therefore they are not directly experiencing the circulation of the other vortex, the filling of each core does\nfeel the circulation created by the vortex in the same\ncomponent, dragging in its way the vortex core in which\nit is placed. The result is an indirect interaction.\nLet us postpone the discussion about the boundary effects and concentrate on the situation in which the radius\nR of the disc\u2013shape trap is sufficiently large to neglect the\nboundary effects during the time scale of the simulations.\nIn the following we consider g11 = g22 = 1.05g12. These\nparticular gij values have been chosen for simplicity, to\nguarantee a complete overlap between the wavefunctions\nof both components. In the case of 87 Rb, the coupling\nconstants have the values g11 : g22 : g12 \u2261 0.97 : 1.03 :\n1.0. These values also imply a large overlap, without\nseparate domains, and therefore the dynamics we discuss\nbelow should be observable in 87 Rb.\nIn the symmetric situation, n1,2 = n0 , the qualitative\nbehavior of single\u2013component vortex\u2013vortex interaction\nis recovered, namely, vortices with the same circulation\nrotate around each other, forming a vortex orbit, whereas\nvortices of opposite circulation move paralelly (vortex\npair) through the fluid. The time evolution of the vortex\ncores is, however, different to the single\u2013component one,\nsince the effective masses of the vortex cores are different.\nThis picture breaks down when the n1 6= n2 . Fig.\n1 shows the position of the vortex lines for the case of\nn1 = 2n2 = 1011 cm\u22122 , d = 4\u03bcm, and R = 20d, for\n\nwhere the velocity of the vortex in the j\u2013th component is\ngiven by ~vj = ~uj /r2 , ~u = ~u2 \u2212~u1 , and \u03ba = 1 (\u22121) for vortices with the same (opposite) circulation. Neglecting in\nEq. (2) the relatively small rhs, and assuming R tending\nto \u221e, one obtains the solution ~v2 \u223c (~r1 \u2212 ~r2 )\u22a5 /|~r1 \u2212 ~r2 |2 ,\nand ~v1 = \u2212(\u03ban2 /n1 )~v2 [27]. The motion of the vortex lines is then determined by the first\u2013order equations\nd~rj /dt = ~vj . The trajectories provided by these equations (solid lines in Fig. 1) describe very well the numerically calculated vortex orbits. Note that since the\nvelocity field is always tangential to the vector which\njoins the vortex lines, the distance between the vortices\nremains constant at any time, and consequently the angular frequency for both orbits is the same. Therefore,\nvortices of the same circulation are always at opposite angles of their respective orbits, whereas vortices with opposite circulation always occupy the same angle. Hence,\nthe angular frequency for both orbits is the same. From\nthis fact, it is easy to show that for vortices with the\nsame/opposite circulation, initially placed at a distance\nd, the orbit of the outer vortex (say in component 1) has\na radius r1 = dn2 /(n1 \u00b1 n2 ), whereas the inner one has\na radius r2 = dn1 /(n1 \u00b1 n2 ). Note that for n1 = n2 the\nfamiliar one\u2013component results are retrieved.\nLet us discuss at this point the role of the boundaries\non the dynamics. Our numerical analysis shows that the\n2\n\n\ffinite size of the trap does not disturb the distance between the vortices, and, as in the case of R \u2192 \u221e, ~r1 \u2212 ~r2\nmoves in a circle. However, the coordinate (~r1 + ~r2 )/2,\nwhich for R \u2192 \u221e moves in a circle as well, performs\nin the presence of a finite R a cycloid motion. As a result, the planetary orbits are not circular anymore, but\nwill precess around a circular orbit, as one can observe\nin Fig. 2, where the same parameters of Fig. 1 are considered, except R = 4.5d. Nevertheless, similar to the\ncase R \u2192 \u221e, the trajectory of the vortex in the denser\ncomponent is always the inner trajectory.\nIn the last part of this Letter we analyze the case of a\nbinary BEC trapped in a 2D harmonic potential of frequency \u03c9. This resembles the situation in which vortices\nare currently created in 87 Rb in JILA [13]. In particular, we shall analyze the interaction of two vortices in the\nsame component, which are created symmetrically from\nthe condensate center, and with the same circulation. In\nhomogeneous as well as single\u2013component trapped condensates, and in the presence of dissipation, the vortices\nwill spiral out from their initial orbit until they finally\nreach the boundaries of the condensate cloud, where they\nare destroyed [28]. We shall show that this is not the case\nin an inhomogeneous binary BEC.\nIn a recent paper [22], the dynamics of a filled vortex in a trapped binary BEC was analyzed. In an\ninhomogeneous potential, the lowest energy solution is\nreached when the component with smaller nonlinear self\u2013\ninteraction occupies the regions of highest density, i.e.\nthe trap center. Therefore, in our case, if the less dense\ncomponent is displaced from the trap center, it will tend\nto return to it. This effect is sometimes called the \"buoyancy\" effect [22]. This effect can counteract the tendency of an off\u2013centered vortex to spiral out. In particular, it has been shown that for sufficiently large nonlinearity a vortex, created in the component with larger\nself\u2013interaction at the center of the trap, can become\nmetastable [22]. We employ a similar treatment to analyze the interaction of vortices. It consists in evaluating,\nfor different distances between vortices, the free energy\n\nE(d) following Eq. (4). For the case of single component\ncondensates, one can show that E(d) decreases with d,\nfor any d. This reflects the fact that in the presence of\ndissipation the vortices tend to spiral out. For vortices\ncreated in the denser component (say 1), the situation is,\nhowever, completely different. Fig. 3 shows the case of\n87\nRb (a11 = 1.03a12 , a22 = 0.97a12 , and a12 = 5.7nm),\nwith a trap frequency \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 30Hz and L = 1\u03bcm, with\nnumber of particles N1 = 105 and N2 = 8 \u00d7 105 . One\nobserves that E(d) clearly grows with d for low d, until it\nreaches a maximal value. This maximum corresponds to\nthe case in which the vortices are placed at the maxima of\nthe unperturbed density distribution of the component 1\n(see inset in Fig. 3). For larger distances the tendency of\nthe vortices to spiral out is no more counteracted since\nthe slope of the density distribution changes the sign.\nTherefore, vortices created sufficiently close to the center\nwill tend to spiral inwards in the presence of dissipation,\nuntil eventually merging at the trap center. Once they\nmerge, a vortex with double circulation will be created.\nSince due to its topology a vortex can only be destroyed\nif it reaches a region of zero density, the created vortex of double circulation will remain metastable at the\ntrap center, where only inelastic processes will in practice limit its lifetime. Following similar arguments, the\nmerging of nv vortices should allow for the creation of a\nmetastable vortex with nv quanta of circulation, opening a new scenario which is naturally forbidden in both\nhomogeneous single\u2013 and multi\u2013component BEC, as well\nas in inhomogeneous single\u2013component condensates.\nLet us finally point out, that a similar argument applies for vortices with opposite circulation created in the\ndenser component and moving parallelly in a toroidal\ntrap [29]. In that case, the \"buoyancy\" effect counteracts\nthe natural tendency of the vortices to mutually annihilate, allowing for the creation of a vortex pair, which will\ncirculate around the torus center in a metastable orbit.\nSummarizing, we have shown that the vortex\u2013vortex\ninteraction in multicomponent condensates, presents\ncharacteristic features such as planetary orbits for vortices placed in different components, and opens new\nZ\n\u0010 h\u03042\n\u0001\ninteresting possibilities for creating metastable vortices\n3\n2\n2\nE= d r\n|\u2207\u03c81 (r)| + |\u2207\u03c82 (r)|\n2m\nwith more than one quanta of circulation, as well as\nmetastable vortex pairs in toroidal geometries.\n+V1 (r)|\u03c81 (r)|2 + V2 (r)|\u03c82 (r)|2\n\u0011\nThe analysis of the vortex\u2013vortex interaction has been\ng22\ng11\n4\n2\n2\n4\n|\u03c81 (r)| + g12 |\u03c81 (r)| |\u03c82 (r)| +\n|\u03c82 (r)| .

[22], by evolving the Gross\u2013\nconcerning the behavior of vortices in 3D binary BEC.\nPitaevskii equation (1) in imaginary time, fixing at evIn particular, for linear vortices, if the relative density\nery iteration the phase of the component in which the\nbetween the different components varies in the direcvortices are created, in order to have the correct phase\ntion of the vortex lines, it should be expected that vorproperties. Once imprinted in this way two vortices at\ntices created in different components will undergo at each\nposition (\u2212d/2, 0) and (d/2, 0), we calculate the energy\ntransversal position planetary orbits of different periods\n3\n\n\fand radii. Consequently, non trivial distortions of the\nvortex lines are expected. In addition, the recent observation of vortex\u2013rings [14] in condensates stimulates the\ninvestigation of the interaction of such more complicated\nstructures in binary BEC. The analysis of these effects is\nbeyond the scope of the present Letter, and will be the\nsubject of further investigation.\nWe acknowledge support from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 407), TMR ERBXTCT-96-002, ESF\nPESC BEC2000+ and EPSRC.
