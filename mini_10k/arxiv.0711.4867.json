We describe centers of infinitesimal Hecke algebra of sl2\nin positive characteristic. In particular, we show that these algebras\nare finitely generated modules over their centers, and the Azumaya and\nsmooth loci of the centers coincide.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper, we will work over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 2. In this setting, we will consider infinitesimal Hecke algebras\nassociated to the Lie algebra sl2 and its natural representation (see [EGG]\nfor the definition of infinitesimal Hecke algebras associated to an arbitrary\nreductive Lie algebra and its representation). We will be concerned with\ntheir centers and finite dimensional representations. Let us recall the precise definition of these algebra.\nLet V be the natural 2-dimensional representation of g = sl2 . Let us fix\nits basis elements x, y so that ex = 0, f x = y, hx = x, hy = \u2212y, here e, f, h\ndenote the standard basis elements of sl2 . Then for any z \u2208 k[\u2206], where \u2206\ndenotes the rescaled Casimir element h2 +4ef \u22122h, one defines an algebra Hz\nas the quotient of Ug \u22c9 T V by the two sided ideal generated by the element\n[x, y]\u2212z, where T V denotes the tensor algebra of V . Thus we get a family of\nalgebras parametrized by elements in k[\u2206]. The algebra Hz can be equipped\nwith a natural algebra filtration F n Hz such that Ug = F 0 Hz , UgV = F 1 Hz\nand F n Hz = (F 1 Hz )n . The main property of Hz is that it satisfies the\nPBW property, namely the natural surjection H0 = U(g \u22c9 V ) \u2192 gr(Hz ) is\nan isomorphism ([K],[EGG]). Thus one can think of algebras Hz as some\nkind of deformations of the enveloping algebra H = H0 depending on a\ndeformation parameter z \u2208 k[\u2206].\nWhen the ground field k has characteristic 0, we proved in [T] that\nthe center of Hz is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable and\ngr(Z(Hz )) = Z(gr(Hz )) = Z(H) (where the letter Z stands for the center of\nan algebra). In this paper we show that if deg(z) < p \u2212 1, then algebra Hz\nis a finitely generated module over its center and just like in the characteristic 0 case gr(Z(Hz )) = Z(gr(Hz )) = Z(H). In this way we have a similar\npicture to the case of symplectic reflection algebras [BFG]. Geometrically\nWe would like to thank V. Ginzburg for suggesting the question, and A. Premet, I.\nGordon for useful remarks.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAKAKI TIKARADZE\n\nSpec Z(Hz ) turns out to be a p-fold ramified cover of the affine space A5 . At\nthe end of the paper, we discuss irreducible modules of Hz . In particular, we\nprove that the Azumaya and the smooth loci of Z(Hz ) coincide. Analogous\nstatements are known to be true for Cherednik algebras [BC], enveloping algebras of semi-simple Lie algebras and quantized enveloping algebras [BG].\nIn the special case of z = 0, we describe all irreducible modules of H.\n2. Center and irreducible representations\nThroughout this paper, we will use the term 'maximal vector' for elements of representations of g annihilated by e. Let us recall the following\ncomputation from [T] which we are going to use later. For any \u03c9 \u2208 k[\u2206] we\nhave\n[\u03c9, x] = (F (\u03c9)h + G(\u03c9))x + 2eF (\u03c9)y.\nWhere F, G : k[\u2206] \u2192 k[\u2206] are linear endomorphisms of k[\u2206] defined recursively as follows:\nF (\u2206n+1 ) = 2\u2206n + (\u2206 \u2212 1)F (\u2206n ) \u2212 2G(\u2206n )\nG(\u2206n+1 ) = \u22123\u2206n + (\u2206 + 3)G(\u2206n ) \u2212 2\u2206F (\u2206n ).\nIt is immediate that degF (\u2206n ) =degG(\u2206n ) = n \u2212 1 and leading coefficient\nof F (\u2206n ) is 2n, and the leading coefficient of G(\u2206n ) is \u2212n(2n + 1). When\nchar(k)=0, it was shown in [T] that center of Hz is generated by the element\ntz = ex2 + hxy \u2212 f x2 \u2212 21 hz \u2212 \u03c9z , where \u03c9z = \u2212F \u22121 (z) + 21 z + 12 F \u22121 (G(z)).\nWe see from this formula that the element tz can be defined in positive\ncharacteristic setting as long as char(k) < p \u2212 1.\nWe will also use the following anti-involution j of Hz defined as follows:\nj(x) = y, j(y) = x, j(h) = h, j(e) = \u2212f, j(f ) = \u2212e.\nMain result of the paper is the following\nTheorem 2.1. If deg z < p \u2212 1, then the center of Hz is generated as\nan algebra over k by ep , f p , hp \u2212 h, xp , yp , tz , where xp has top symbol with\nrespect to the filtration equal to xp , and yp has y p . Spec(Z(Hz )) is a finite\n(ramified) cover of A5 =Spec(k[ep , f p , hp \u2212 h, xp , yp ]) of degree p.\nThe proof will be divided into several steps. As a first step, we will\nshow that the center of H (the associated graded of Hz ) is generated by\nep , hp \u2212 h, f p , xp , y p , t (where t = t0 = ex2 + hxy \u2212 f x2 ).\nWe will argue by induction on the filtration degree of the central element.\nThe first thing that needs to be checked is that\nZ(H) \u2229 Ug = k[ep , f p , hp \u2212 h]. Since Z(Ug)\n= k[ep , f p , hp \u2212 h, \u2206] [V], any a \u2208\nP\nZ(H) \u2229 Ug may be expressed as a = i<p \u03b1i \u2206i , where \u03b1i \u2208 k[ep , f p , hp \u2212 h].\nWe have\nX\n0 = [a, x] =\n\u03b1i [\u2206i , x],\nP\nthus\n\u03b1i F (\u2206i ) = 0 (recall that F is the linear endomorphism of k[\u2206] from\nthe beginning.) Since F (\u2206i ) has a degree i \u2212 1 (with leading coefficient\n\n\fINFINITESIMAL HECKE ALGEBRAS OF sl2 IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC\n\n3\n\n2i), we get that \u03b1i = 0 for i > 0 since elements 1, \u2206, ..., \u2206p\u22121 are linearly\nindependent over k[hp \u2212 h, ep , f p ], therefore a \u2208 k[hp \u2212 h, f p , ep ].\nNow, we will deal with central elements of H of positive degree in x, y. Let\nus begin by making some preliminary remarks about homogeneous elements\nof H that commute with e and y. Let a be such an element. We may write\nn\nX\nbi y i xn\u2212i )xm , bi \u2208 Ug, bn 6= 0.\na=(\ni=0\n\nFrom [e, a] = 0 we get that ibi = \u2212[e, bi\u22121 ]. In particular, [e, bn ] = 0. Also\nfrom [a, y] = 0 we get that [bn , y] contains no elements from Ugy in its PBW\nmonomial expression. Now we have the following\nLemma 2.1. Let \u03b1 \u2208 Ug be an element which commutes with e, such that\n[\u03b1, y] has no terms from Ugy in its PBW monomial expansion. Then \u03b1\nbelongs to k[hp \u2212 h, f p , e]\nProof. We will argue by induction on the filtration degree (with respect to\nthe standard filtration of Ug). Let \u03b1 \u2208 Ug be an element which satisfies the\nconditions of the lemma. Let us write\nX\n\u03b1=\nf i \u03b1i , \u03b1i \u2208 k[h, e]\nexactly in this order, meaning that h is on the left, e is on the right. Then\n[\u03b1, y] has no y if and only if [\u03b1i , y] has no y. Let\nX\n\u03b2=\naij hi ej , aij \u2208 k\nbe such that [\u03b2, y] has no y. Then\nX\nX\n[\u03b2, y] =\njaij hi ej\u22121 x +\naij [hi , y]ej ,\nand [hi , y] = (\u2212ihi\u22121 + lower powers of h)y, therefore [hi , y]ej = \u2212ihi\u22121 ej y+\nterms with lower powers of h. Hence the highest i with aij 6= 0 is a multiple\nof p. Then considering the element \u03b2 \u2212(hp \u2212h)i/p aij ej , we see that \u03b2 may be\nwritten as a linear combination of elements of the form (hp \u2212h)i ej . Therefore\nm\nX\n(hp \u2212 h)i \u03b2i , \u03b2i \u2208 k[f, e],\n\u03b1=\ni=0\n\nwhere f is on the left from e. Then\nX\n[e, \u03b1] = 0 =\n(hp \u2212 h)i [e, \u03b2i ]\nThis implies that [e, \u03b2k ] = 0. Indeed, looking at the terms with the highest\npower of h, it will equal to hpk (term with the highest power of h in [e, \u03b2k ])\n(where we right h on the left in the PBW expression of [e, \u03b2k ]). Thus, each\n\u03b2i commutes with e. Let us write\nm\nX\nf j gj , gj \u2208 k[e].\n\u03b2i =\nj=0\n\n\f4\n\nAKAKI TIKARADZE\n\nAssume without loss of generality that m < p. Now [e, \u03b2i ] will contain\nhf m\u22121 gm , and this forces m = 0.\n\u0003\nApplying the anti-involution j, we get an analogous result for f and x.\nLet a as above be a homogeneous central element, we claim that m is\na multiple of p. Indeed, from 0 = [f, a], looking at highest power of y,\nit is clear that bn y n+1 mxm\u22121 = 0. hence p divides m, so without loss of\ngenerality we may assume that m = 0.\nLet us write n = pl + m (not to be confused with the old m), 0 \u2264 m < p.\nFrom the above lemma, we conclude that bn = \u03b1ek , b0 = \u03b1\u2032 f k for some\n\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 k[ep , f p , hp \u2212 h], k < p. We also have (ad e)m+1 f k = 0, but m =\n2kmodp (since a has a weight 0 with respect to h), therefore either m = 2k,\nor m = 2k \u2212 p. The latter case is impossible since then m < k, which may\nnot happen by the Lemma below. Thus m = 2k. Now consider the element\na \u2212 tm \u03b1(xp )l . this is a central element divisible by y. Hence, proceeding by\ninduction, we are done.\nThe following is well-known ([St]), but we include the proof for the sake\nof completeness.\nLemma 2.2. If k < p, then (ad e)k (f k ) 6= 0.\nProof. If we write (ad e)k (f k ) as a sum of monomials in the PBW basis\nh, e, f then each term will have a degree at most k, and it will have a term\nk!hk in it. Therefore it cannot be 0.\n\u0003\nFor the sake of brevity, let us denote the ring k[ep , hp \u2212 h, f p ] by R. So\nfar we have proved that Z(H) = R[xp , y p , t]. Now we turn to the case of a\nnonzero parameter z. Using the well-known identity (ad a)p = ad(ap ), we\nsee that elements ep , hp \u2212 h, f p , tz lie in the center of Hz . We have a natural\ninjection gr(Z(Hz )) \u2192 Z(H) and we have to show that it is actually an\nisomorphism, so it remains to demonstrate the existence of xp , yp \u2208 Z(Hz )\nsuch that they map to xp , y p respectively. By virtue of the anti-involution\nj, it will suffice to prove the existence of xp . We will prove this by analyzing\nmaximal vectors in H (with respect to the adjoint action of ad(g)) and\nmanipulating the anti-involution j. In a sense, the proof is similar in spirit\nto the proof of the existence of tz in characteristic 0 [T].\nLet us start by establishing certain facts about Ug which will be used in\na crucial way later (These facts may be very well-known but we could not\nfind them in the literature).\nLemma 2.3. Let a \u2208 Ug be a maximal vector. Then a lies in R[\u2206, e]\nProof. We may assume that a is homogeneous with respect to ad(h), say of\nweight n and is not divisible by e from the left. Let us write a as a sum of\n\n\fINFINITESIMAL HECKE ALGEBRAS OF sl2 IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC\n\n5\n\nPBW monomials\nm\nX\nei gi (h)f j , gi (h) \u2208 k[h], g0 (h), gm (h) 6= 0, 2(i \u2212 j) = nmod(p).\na=\ni=0\n\nFrom [e, a] = 0 we get that [gm (h), e] has no terms beginning with e and\nn\n[e, f \u2212 2 mod(p) ] = 0. Thus, n = 0 and gm (h) \u2208 R. Hence, if we consider\ngm (h)( 41 \u2206)m \u2212 a and apply induction on m we will be done.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.1. Let \u03b1 \u2208 Z(Ug) such that it has no terms involving ep . If\n\u03b1f m = [e, b] for 0 < k < p and b \u2208 Ug, then \u03b1 = 0\nProof. First, suppose \u03b1 is divisible by f p . Then we may write \u03b1 = \u03b2f p . If\nwe write b as sum of PBW monomials in ei hj f k , taking the commutator of\neach such monomial with e of never increases power of f in it. This implies\nthat some of monomials of b with the power of f less than p must commute\nwith e, hence we may disregard it. Thus we may write b = b\u2032 f p . Therefore\nwithout loss of generality we may assume that \u03b1 is not divisible by f p .\nWe claim that in this case there exists a regular semi-simple character \u03c7\nsuch that \u03b1 will not vanish on V\u03bb . Let us recall the corresponding definitions\n[FP]. A character is called regular semi-simple if it lies in the coadjoint orbit\nunder the action of SL2 (k) of a character defined as follows :\n\u03c7(ep ) = \u03c7(f p ) = 0, \u03c7(hp \u2212 h) = c = \u03bbp \u2212 \u03bb, c 6= 0 \u2208 k,\nand\nV\u03c7,\u03bb = Ug\u03c7 \u2297B k\u03bb\nwhere B is a subalgebra generated by e, h and k\u03bb is its one-dimensional\nrepresentation on which e vanishes and h acts as a multiplication by \u03bb\nwhere \u03bbp \u2212 \u03bb = c. Now the desired statement boils down to the following\nstatement about polynomials in one variable. We thank M. Boyarchenko for\nthe following quick proof.\nP\nLemma 2.4. If\ngi (s(s + 2))(sp \u2212 s)i = 0 for gi (s) \u2208 k[s], deg(gi ) < p then\nall gi must equal 0.\nProof. If we make the substitution s = s \u2212 1 and replace gi (s) by gi (s \u2212 1),\nthen we will have\nm\nX\ngi (s2 )(sp \u2212 s)i = 0, gm 6= 0, g0 6= 0.\n0\n\nWe have\n0=\n\nX\n\nsi gi (s2 )(s\n\np\u22121\n2\n\n\u2212 1)i .\n\nThen, looking at even powers of s we conclude that\nX\n0=\ng2j (s2 )((sp \u2212 s)2 )j .\ni\n\nSince deg(g2j\n\n(s2 ))\n\n< 2p, we get that all g2j = 0, a contradiction.\n\n\f6\n\nAKAKI TIKARADZE\n\n\u0003\nAs it is well-known [FP], these modules are irreducible and have as a basis\nv\u03bb , f v\u03bb , ..., f p\u22121 v\u03bb . To complete the proof of the proposition, it will suffice\nto check that f m \u2208ad(e)(End(V\u03bb )) only for finitely many \u03bb \u2208 k. This is\nvery easy to see since if we have f m = [e, A], where A \u2208 End(V\u03bb ), then\nA = ai : kf i v\u03bb \u2192 kf i+m+1 v\u03bb , where ai \u2208 k. If we write out the commutator\ncondition we immediately see that \u03bb is a root of a polynomial in Fp which\nis independent of \u03bb, hence there are only finitely many such \u03bb.\n\u0003\nOur goal will be to produce an element Ax of weight 0 such that\nAx \u2208 R[tz , e, x] \u2229 F p\u22121 Hz and[Ax , \u2206] = [xp , \u2206]. By the lemma below, this\nwill complete the proof.\nLemma 2.5. Let Ax \u2208 R[tz , e, x] be an element of weight 0 lying in F p\u22121 Hz ,\nsuch that [xp \u2212 Ax , \u2206] = 0. Then xp \u2212 Ax lies in the center of Hz .\nProof. Since xp \u2212 Ax commutes with e, h we get that [xp \u2212 Ax , f ] = 0.\nApplying ad x to this, we get that [xp \u2212 Ax , y] = 0, hence xp \u2212 Ax is a\ncentral element.\n\u0003\nThe following describes maximal vectors in F p\u22121 H.\nProposition 2.2. Let A \u2208 F p\u22121 H be a homogeneous (in x, y) maximal\nvector. Then it can be expressed as a sum B + C, where B is a linear\ncombination of elements of the form \u03b3ej [xi , \u2206], \u03b3ej xi ,\u03b3 \u2208 R[t], while C is a\nhomogeneous maximal vector whose coefficient of highest power of y lies in\nZ(Ug) and is not divisible by e.\nProof. First we establish that [\u2206, x]xn can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of the form \u03b3ej [xi , \u2206], \u03b3ej xi . Indeed,\nX\n[\u2206, xn ] =\nxk ((2h \u2212 3)x + 4ey)xn\u2212k\u22121\nk<n\n\n= n((2h \u2212 3) + 4ey)xn\u22121 + c\u2032 xn\n= n[\u2206, x]xn\u22121 + c\u2032 xn ,\nwhere c\u2032 is some constant. Thus B can be taken from the span of\n\u03b3ei [x, \u2206]xj , \u03b3ei xj which is a k[f p , hp \u2212 h, \u2206, t] \u2212 k[x]-module. Let A be a\nhomogeneous (with respect to ad h and in x, y) maximal vector of degree\nn. Without loss of generality we may assume\nthat it is not divisible by x\nP\ni\nfrom the right, so we may write A =\nai x y n\u2212i with a0 6= 0. We know\nthat a0 must be a maximal vector, thus by the above lemma we may write\na0 = \u03b1em , where \u03b1 \u2208 R[\u2206] and it is not divisible by e. Now, if 21 n \u2264 m,\nthen considering one of the following elements\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b1em\u2212 2 n t 2 n \u2212 A, \u03b1em\u2212 2 (n\u22121) t 2 (n\u22121) [\u2206, x] \u2212 A,\n4\n\n\fINFINITESIMAL HECKE ALGEBRAS OF sl2 IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC\n\n7\n\nit will be divisible by x from the right and we may apply induction on the\ndegree of A.\nSo it just remains to deal with the case 2m < n. In this case \u03b1em =\nc(ad e)n (an ) (here we also need the fact that A can not be divisible by y\nfrom the right, which was established earlier in the proof), where c is some\nnonzero constant. Applying (ad f )2m to both sides we get that \u03b1f m = [e, b]\nfor some b \u2208 Ug, but as the above proposition shows this can only happen\nwhen m = 0, in which case we get an element of type C from the statement\nof the proposition.\n\u0003\nPassing to the associated graded, we see that we may replace H by Hz\nin the lemma above. Now let us look at [X p , \u2206]. Clearly this is a maximal\nvector lying in F p\u22121 Hz . So we may apply the above proposition. Using an\nanalogous proposition for y, we may write\n[xp , \u2206] = [Ax , \u2206] + Bx + C,\nwhere Ax , Bx \u2208 R[tz , \u2206, e, x] and C is a maximal vector whose coefficient\nin front of the highest power of y is not divisible by e. However [xp , \u2206]\nis divisible by e from the left and so are all the terms [Ax , \u2206], Bx (since\nthey have weight 0), forcing C = 0. Analogously for y, we have [y p , \u2206] =\n[A\u2032y , \u2206] + By\u2032 , where A\u2032y , By\u2032 \u2208 R[tz , \u2206, f, y] all have weight 0 (with respect to\nad(h) as always). Our objective is to prove that Bx = 0 and Ax \u2208 R[e, x, tz ].\nWe will accomplish this by utilizing the involution j. If we apply it to the\nlast equality we will get\n[xp , \u2206] = \u2212[j(y p ), j(\u2206)] = [j(A\u2032y ), \u2206] \u2212 j(By\u2032 ) = [ax , \u2206] + Bx .\nBut on the other hand\n[xp , \u2206] = 4e[xp , f ] = \u22124e(ad x)p\u22122 (z)\n[y p , \u2206] = 4f [y p , e] = 4f (ad y)p\u22122 (z).\nTherefore,\ne\u22121 [xp , \u2206] = \u2212\n\n1\n(ad e)p\u22122 (f \u22121 [y p , \u2206])\n(p \u2212 2)!\n\n= \u2212(ad e)p\u22122 (f \u22121 [y p , \u2206]).\nComparing above formulas, we get\n[j(A\u2032y ), \u2206] \u2212 j(By\u2032 ) = \u2212e([ad((e)p\u22122 [f \u22121 A\u2032y , \u2206] + ad(e)p\u22122 f \u22121 By\u2032 ]).\nNow if By\u2032 = f i y p\u2212i , then\n(ad e)p\u22122 (f i\u22121 y p\u22122i ) = (\u22121)i\u22121 (p \u2212 2)!ei\u22121 xp\u22122i\n= (\u22121)i\u22121 ei\u22121 xp\u22122i ,\n\n\f8\n\nAKAKI TIKARADZE\n\nso\n\u2212j(f i y p\u22122i ) = (\u22121)i ei xp\u22122i = (ad e)p\u22122 (By\u2032 ).\nThus if we write\nA\u2032y = \u03b1i \u03c6i (\u2206)y i , By\u2032 = \u03b2i \u03c8i (\u2206)y i\nwhere \u03b1i , \u03b2i \u2208 R[f, tz ]; \u03c6i (\u2206), \u03c8i (\u2206) \u2208 \u2206k[\u2206], we will get that\n[\u03b1i [\u03c6i (\u2206), y i ] + \u03b2i \u03c8i (\u2206)y i , \u2206] = 2By\u2032 .\nThe next couple of lemmas imply that from the last equality it follows that\nBy\u2032 = 0 and \u03c6i are constants (they do not contain \u2206) which will end the\nproof of existence of xp .\nLemma 2.6. Let A \u2208 R[\u2206, e, x, tz ]\u2229F p\u22121 Hz be of weight 0. Then there does\nnot exist a maximal vector B which can be expressed as a sum of elements\nof the form \u03b1i tiz [x, \u2206]xj , \u03b1i \u2208 R[\u2206, e], such that [B, \u2206] = A.\nProof. By passing to the associated graded, it suffices to consider the case\nz = 0. Assume that such a B exists. We may assume that A is homogeneous\nin x, y, since [B, \u2206] = 4e[B, f ]. By dividing by e from the\nP left we get [B, f ] =\nA1 with A1 \u2208 R[\u2206, e, t], wt(A)=-2. Let us write B = ( ai xi y n\u2212i )xk , where\na0 6= 0. After picking terms with the lowest powers of x we get\nka0 y n xk\u22121 = \u03b2f r y 2r xn\u22122r\nfor some r, where \u03b2 \u2208 k[\u2206, e] implying that f r is a maximal vector. This\nis false unless r = 0, thus k = 0. Writing B as a sum of elements of type\n\u03b1i ti [x, \u2206]xn\u22122i\u22121 , we see by the preceding remark that it must contain a\nnonzero term of the form \u03b1tn\u22121/2 [x, \u2206] with \u03b1 \u2208 R[\u2206]. In particular, n must\nbe odd, hence A may not contain any terms with no powers of x in it. If we\ncan show that [B, f ] has such a term, we will have a contradiction. We have\n\u03b1tn\u22121/2 [[\u2206, x], f ] = tn\u22121/2 [\u03b1[\u2206, x], f ], since weight of B=0, \u03b1 = \u03b3em , where\nm = 12 (p \u2212 1), \u03b3 \u2208 R[\u2206]. Hence it would suffice to show that [ek [\u2206, x], f ]\ncontains y. We have\n[ek [\u2206, x], f ] = \u2212ek [\u2206, y] + [ek , f ][\u2206, x].\nGrouping y terms in the above we get the following term\n([ek , f ]4e \u2212 ek (2h + 3))y.\nStraightforward computation shows that this term is not 0.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.7. If an element A \u2208 F p\u22121 Hz commutes with g, then it belongs\nto R[\u2206, tz ].\nProof. We may pass to the associated graded, so once again we may assume\nthat z = 0. As explained before A may not be divisible by either x, y.\nAssuming that it is homogeneous of degree n, we may write\nX\nA=\n\u03b1i xn\u2212i y i , \u03b10 , \u03b1n 6= 0, \u03b10 = \u03b1em , \u03b1n = \u03b2em\n\n\fINFINITESIMAL HECKE ALGEBRAS OF sl2 IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC\n\n9\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R[\u2206] and n = 2m, Hence A\u2212\u03b1tm is divisible by x, so A = \u03b1tm .\n\u0003\nP\nLemma 2.8. Let A = i \u03b1i ti [\u03c6i , xn\u22122i ], \u03b1i \u2208 R[e] be a homogeneous element (in x, y) of weight 0 such that \u03c6i \u2208 \u2206k[\u2206]. Then [A, \u2206] = 0 if and\nonly if all \u03b1i are 0.\nProof. Since A commutes with e and h, we get that it must lie in the centralizer of g, hence by the previous lemma we have\nX\nn\nA=\n\u03b1i ti [\u03c6i , xn\u22122i ] = \u03b2t 2 , \u03b2 \u2208 R[\u2206].\ni\n\nThis equality implies in particular that \u03b10 [\u03c60 , xn ] is divisible by t. Let us\nshow that this cannot be the case. Consider the universal enveloping algebra\nfiltration on H (recall that H = U(sl2 \u22c9 V )). The top symbol of \u03b10 [\u03c60 , xn ]\nwith respect to this filtration is equal to\nn(F (\u03c60 )h + G(\u03c60 )x + 2eF (\u03c60 )y)xn\u22121 ,\nwhich is clearly not divisible by t = ey 2 +hxy\u2212f x2 in gr(H) = Sym(sl2 \u2295V ),\nhence \u03b10 [\u03c60 , xn ] is not divisible by t in H.\n\u0003\nNext, we will show that elements 1, t, ..., tp\u22121 are linearly independent over\nthe ring Z0 (H) = k[ep , f p , hp \u2212 h, xp , y p ]P(which by itself is a polynomial\nring in five variables). Indeed, let 0 = i<p ai ti , where ai \u2208 Z0 (H). We\nmay assume that the elements ai are homogeneous in x, y and the whole\nexpression in the summation has the same degree n (in x, y). Thus we have\nn =deg(ai ) + 2i, and since deg(ai ) are multiples of p, we have 2i = nmod(p).\nWe deduce that at most one ai 6= 0, hence all ai = 0.\nNow we claim that\ntp = ep (xp )2 \u2212 f p (y p )2 + (hp \u2212 h)xp y p .\nIndeed, let us consider the following central element a = tp \u2212 (ep (xp )2 \u2212\nf p (xp )2 ). It is clear that this element is divisible by both x, y from the right,\ntherefore from the argument above we see that it must be divisible by xp y p .\nSince a has degree 2p, we must have\ntp = ep (xp )2 \u2212 f p (xp )2 + \u03c9xp y p ,\nwhere \u03c9 is some element in k[ep , hp \u2212 h, f p ]. Now let us consider the enveloping algebra filtration on H, using the well-known fact that\n(a + b)p = ap + bp modA/[A, A] for any algebra A over k and any elements\na, b \u2208 A, we see that tp \u2212 (ep (xp )2 \u2212 f p(xp )2 \u2212 (hp \u2212 h)xp y p ) has the filtration\ndegree less than 3p. Hence, we see that\ntp \u2212 (ep (xp )2 \u2212 f p (xp )2 + (hp \u2212 h)xp y p ) = \u03b1xp y p\nwhere \u03b1 is some constant. We claim that this constant must be 0. Indeed, if\nwe write tp as the sum of PBW monomials (x, y on the right), then it becomes\nclear that each monomial term appearing in tp belongs to gH. Thus we may\n\n\f10\n\nAKAKI TIKARADZE\n\nconclude that \u03b1 = 0. To conclude, we have shown that Z(H) is isomorphic\nto k[x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , y]/(y p \u2212 x1 x22 \u2212 x3 x24 + x5 x2 x4 ), thus Spec(Z(H)) is a\n(ramified) degree p covering of A5 .\nNow let us consider the case of an arbitrary z. We will show that elements\n1, tz , ..., tp\u22121\nare linearly independent over Z0 (Hz ) = k[ep , f p , hp , xp , yp ] and\nz\ngenerate Z(Hz ) as a module over Z0 (Hz ). This immediately follows from the\ncorresponding statement for 1, t, ...tp\u22121 over gr(Z(Hz )). Thus there exists a\nmonic polynomial f (\u03c4 ) in one variable \u03c4 of degree p such that Z(Hz ) is\nisomorphic to Z0 (Hz )[\u03c4 ]/(f (\u03c4 )). Thus Spec(Z(Hz )) is a degree p covering of\nSpec Z0 (Hz ))=A5 .\nLet us write an explicit formula for the central element xp when the\nparameter z is at most linear. Clearly, if z is a constant, then already xp is\ncentral, thus we assume that z = \u2206 + a, a \u2208 k. We have\n[z, x] = (2h \u2212 3)x + 4ey,\nso\n\n[[z, x], x] = (ad x)2 (z) = 2x2 \u2212 4ez,\n\nhence\n\n(ad x)2n (z) = (\u22124e)n\u22121 (2x2 \u2212 4ez)\n\nand\n(ad x)2n+1 (z) = [x, (ad x)2n (z)] = (\u22124e)n\u22121 (4e(2h \u2212 3)x + 4ey))\n= (\u22121)n\u22121 (4e)n ((2h \u2212 3)x + 4ey).\nLet us write p as 2k + 1. We will make the following computation:\n[f, ek x] = ek y \u2212 khek\u22121 x + k(k \u2212 1)ek\u22121 x.\nWe claim that [f, xp + (\u22124)k ek x] = 0. Indeed\n[f, xp ] = \u2212[xp , f ] = \u2212(ad x)p (f ) = (ad x)p\u22122 (z).\nThus\n\n[f, xp ] = (\u22121)k (4e)k\u22121 ((2h \u2212 3)x + 4ey),\n\nand\n[f, \u2212(\u22124)k ek x] = \u22124k ek y + 4k khek\u22121 x( k \u2212 1)kek\u22121 x = [f, xp ].\nAs a result, we get that xp = xp + (\u22124)k ek x lies in the center of Hz .\nCorollary 2.1. Algebra Hz is a prime Noetherian ring which is Auslander\nregular and Cohen-Macaulay, and it is finite dimensional over its center and\nits PI-degree is equal to p2\nProof. After passing to the associated graded and applying results of [BG],\nthe only thing which needs to be checked is the part about the center.\nIt is well-known that H being the enveloping algebra of a restricted Lie\nalgebra is a free module of dimension p5 over Z0 (H). Hence again by the\nassociated graded argument, Hz is a free module of dimension p5 over Z0 .\nSince [K(Z(Hz )) : K(Z0 )] = p where K(\u2212) denotes the field of fractions, we\nsee that the PI-degree of Hz is equal to p2 .\n\u0003\n\n\fINFINITESIMAL HECKE ALGEBRAS OF sl2 IN POSITIVE CHARACTERISTIC\n\n11\n\nNow we turn to the study of irreducible representations of Hz . The main\nresult is the following\nTheorem 2.2. For any z \u2208 k[\u2206] such that deg(z) < p \u2212 1, the Azumaya\nand the smooth loci of Hz coincide.\nProof. By the previous result, Hz has PI-degree equal to p2 . Hence by\nthe results of [BG], it suffices to show that there exists an open set U \u2282\nSpec(Z(Hz )) whose complement has codimension at least 2 in Z(Hz ), such\nthat for any \u03c7 \u2208 U, algebra Hz has an irreducible representation of dimension \u2265 p2 .\nLet us consider a set of characters \u03c7 \u2208 SpecZ(Hz ) for which \u03c7(ep ) =\n\u03c7(f p ) = 0, \u03c7(hp \u2212 h) 6= 0 thus sl2 part is regular semisimple, and \u03c7(xp ) 6= 0\nor \u03c7(yp ) 6= 0. We claim that any such \u03c7 is in the Azumaya locus. Indeed,\nwe may assume without loss of generality that \u03c7(xp ) 6= 0. Let V\u03c7 be an\nirreducible module for \u03c7. Since h acts diagonalizably and e acts nilpotently\non V\u03c7 , there exists a nonzero element v \u2208 V\u03c7 such that ev = 0, hv = \u03bbv for\nsome \u03bb \u2208 k (evidently \u03bbp \u2212 \u03bb = \u03c7(hp \u2212 h).) Then, clearly exi v = 0, h(xi v) =\n(i + \u03bb)xi v for any i = 0, ..., p \u2212 1. It follows from the description of xp\nthat xp v = xp v = \u03c7(xp )v 6= 0, in particular all xi are nonzero. Therefore\nV\u03c7 considered as a module over sl2 has V (\u03bb + i) as a submodule, for all\ni = 0, ..., p \u2212 1 (where V (\u03bb + i) is an irreducible module over sl2 for the\nregular semi-simple character \u03c7 corresponding to weight \u03bb + i [FP]). Thus,\ndimV\u03c7 \u2265 p2 , hence \u03c7 is in the Azumaya locus.\nNext let us consider characters \u03c7 with the property \u03c7(ep ) = \u03c7(xp ) =\n\u03c7(hp \u2212 h) = 0. Let us denote by H\u03c7 the fiber of Hz at the point \u03c7 \u2208\nSpec(Z(Hz )). Let us consider the module M\u03c7 = H\u03c7 \u2297B\u03c7 k\u03c7 (analog of the\nbaby Verma module), where k\u03c7 = kv, xv = ev = 0, hv = 0, and B\u03c7 is a\nsubalgebra of H\u03c7 generated by e, x, h. It is clear that dimM\u03c7 = p2 and M\u03c7\nis spanned by elements f i y j v, i, j < p. Our goal will be to produce \u03b2 p = \u03c7(yp )\nsuch that M\u03c7 is irreducible. Let us assume that it is not irreducible. Let us\nchoose a homogeneous weight element (with respect to ad(h)) g \u2208 k[f, y] of\nsmallest total degree in f, y such that Hz gv is a proper submodule of M\u03c7 .\nIt is clear that we may choose such g with the property that egv = xgv = 0.\nIt is also clear that y is invertible on M\u03c7 . Therefore we may write\ng=\n\nn\nX\n\nai f i y 2n\u22122i\n\ni=0\n\nwhere a0 = 1, an 6= 0, ai \u2208 k, 2n < p. It is easy to see that such ai are\ndetermined uniquely (follows from [x, g]v = 0), in particular, they do not\ndepend on \u03b2. Let us write yp as yp = y p + f y p\u22122 b0 + ... + f k ybk , where k =\n1\np\np\u22122 \u2212 ... \u2212 \u03b2 p = 0\n2 (p \u2212 1) and bi \u2208 k[\u2206]. Then we have the equality y \u2212 c0 f y\nin the endomorphism ring of M\u03c7 . Let L\u03c7 = M\u03c7 /Hz gv, then L(\u03c7) = k[f, y]/I\nwhere I = Ann(L\u03c7 ) \u2229 k[f, y]. We have that f p \u2212 1, g \u2208 I, clearly we may\nchoose \u03b2 so that y p + c0 f y p\u22122 + ...\u03b2 p is invertible in k[f, y]/I thus L\u03c7 = 0,\na contradiction. Thus M\u03c7 is irreducible for generic values of \u03b2.\n\n\f12\n\nAKAKI TIKARADZE\n\nLet us summarize: Let U be the SL2 -orbit (under the adjoint action)\nof characters \u03c7 such that \u03c7(ep ) = \u03c7(f p ) = 0, \u03c7(hp \u2212 h) 6= 0 and either\n\u03c7(xp ) or \u03c7(yp ) is nonzero. Also, let V be an SL2 -orbit of characters \u03c7 such\nthat \u03c7(f p ) = 1, \u03c7(hp \u2212 h) = 0, \u03c7(ep ) = 0. Then we proved that U is in\nthe Azumaya locus, and the Azumaya locus has a nonempty intersection\nwith V. Now since V has codimension 1, and the complement of U \u222a V has\ncodimension 2 (in Spec(Z(Hz ))), we may deduce that the complement of the\nAzumaya locus has codimension \u2265 2. Hence, by the results of [BG], we are\ndone.\n\u0003\nIn what follows we explicitly describe all irreducible modules for the case\nz = 0. Thus for a given central character \u03c7, we want to describe corresponding irreducible modules of H\u03c7 . We may assume without loss of generality that\na central character \u03c7 satisfies the equality \u03c7(ep ) = 0 (using SL2 (k)-action.)\nWe will adopt the following notation. By N\u03c7 we denote a subalgebra of\nH\u03c7 generated by f, y and k\u03c7 will denote its one dimensional representation\nkv = k\u03c7 such that f p v = \u03c7(f p )v, y p v = \u03c7(y p )v.\nProposition 2.3. Let \u03c7 \u2208 Spec(Z(Hz )) be a character such that \u03c7(xp ) 6= 0,\nthen the module M\u03c7 = H\u03c7 \u2297N\u03c7 k\u03c7 is the irreducible rank p2 module over\nH\u03c7 . If \u03c7(xp ) = 0 and \u03c7(y p ) 6= 0 then M\u03c7 = H\u03c7 \u2297B\u03c7 k\u03c7 is the irreducible\nmodule of rank p2 . If \u03c7(xp ) = \u03c7(y p ) = 0 then any irreducible H\u03c7 modules is\nan irreducible sl2 -module on which x, y act as 0.\nProof. From the description of the center of H it follows that the singular\nlocus of Z(H) is xp = y p = 0. If \u03c7 \u2208 Spec(Z(H)) belongs to the singular\nlocus, and V\u03c7 is an irreducible module of H\u03c7 , then it is clear that there\nexists a nonzero v \u2208 V\u03c7 , such that xv = yv = 0, which implies that V V\u03c7 = 0\n(recall that V = kx \u2295 ky). Thus H\u03c7 is an irreducible sl2 -module.\nLet a character \u03c7 be in the smooth locus, thus by the previous theorem,\nit belongs to the Azumaya locus. Hence we only need to show that modules\nin the proposition are nonzero and have dimension \u2264 p2 .\nLet us start with the case when \u03c7(xp ) = 0. It is clear that dim (M\u03c7 ) = p2 ,\nso there is nothing to prove. Next, we consider the case when \u03c7(y p ) = 0.\nThus M\u03c7 is spanned by elements of the form ei xj hl v. But we claim that\nM\u03c7 = k[e, x]v. Indeed, since t = ey 2 + hxy \u2212 f x2 acts as a scalar, it follows\nthat multiplication by hxy preserves k[e, x]v, so if \u03c7(y p ) 6= 0 then hv \u2208\nk[e, x]v. If \u03c7(y p ) = 0, then we have hxyexp\u22122 v = \u2212hxp v. Thus, hv \u2208 k[e, x]v,\nso M\u03c7 = k[e, x]v, in particular dimM\u03c7 \u2264 p2 . Now let us assume that \u03c7(y p ) 6=\n0. Then from the fact that hxyv \u2208 k[e, y]v we see that hv \u2208 k[e, y], hence\nM\u03c7 = k[e, x]v. It is clear that an irreducible module over H\u03c7 is a quotient\nof M\u03c7 , thus V\u03c7 = M\u03c7 and we are done.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[BC]\n\nK. Brown, K.
