The similarity of the X-ray spectrum of 3C 445 to Seyferts\nunderscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN similarly\nhost both cold and warm gas.\nSubject Headings:Galaxies: active - galaxies: radio \u2013 galaxies: individual - X-rays:\ngalaxies\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe X-ray emission from AGN is a powerful tool to investigate the structure and\nphysical conditions of the matter in the proximity of the central supermassive black hole.\nIn particular, sensitive X-ray spectroscopy has been very successful in disentangling the\ncontributions from warm and cold matter in Seyferts. At soft X-rays, more than 50% of\nthese sources exhibit complex intrinsic absorption/emission features suggesting the presence\nof photoionized gas (Crenshaw et al. 2003), containing a significant fraction of the accretion\nmass. In a handful of sources, blueshifted absorption features were observed, indicating an\n>\n\noutflow from the nucleus with quasi-relativistic velocities, v/c \u223c 0.1 (Chartas et al. 2002,\nPounds et al. 2003, Reeves, O'Brien, & Ward 2003; see also Braito et al. 2007 and references\ntherein). The same absorbing gas is thought to be responsible for the soft X-ray emission\nlines observed in type-2 sources (Guainazzi et al. 2005; Turner et al. 1997), via scattering\nor reflection (Netzer 1996). Reflection features at hard X-rays (Fe K\u03b1 line, Compton hump)\nindicate reprocessing by cold gas in an accretion disk (George & Fabian 1991, Nandra et\nal. 1997), and provide a way to explore the innermost regions around the black hole where\ngravitational effects are most important. A prominent, broad Fe K\u03b1 emission line at 6.4\nkeV, together with a hump peaking around 20\u201330 keV (the \"Compton hump\") indicate\nreprocessing of the optical-UV emission in colder gas arranged in an accretion disk. A\npc-scale molecular torus encases the accretion flow, spurring orientation-based unification\nmodels.\nIn contrast, the inner regions of radio-loud AGN are much more poorly studied, because\nof the relative rarity and distance of these sources. Broad-Line Radio Galaxies (BLRGs) are\nby now thought to exhibit weaker reflection features and flatter X-ray continua than Seyfert\n1s (e.g., Sambruna, Eracleous, & Mushotzky 2002, and references therein). No evidence for\n<\n\nwarm absorbers was detected so far in bright BLRGs at energies \u223c 2 keV with ROSAT and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nASCA (Sambruna et al. 1999, S99 in the following; Reynolds 1997), BeppoSAX (Grandi,\nMalaguti, & Fiocchi 2006), and with Chandra and XMM-Newton (Gliozzi et al. 2007; Lewis\net al. 2005; Ogle et al. 2005; Ballantyne et al. 2004). A recent 120 ks Suzaku observation of\n3C 120 shows a featureless continuum at soft X-rays, attributed to the radio jet (Kataoka\net al. 2007). It may thus seem that, contrary to Seyferts, the central engines of BLRGs are\ndevoid of warm gas.\nHowever, there are reasons to expect the presence of a medium in BLRGs and other\nradio-loud AGN. For example, centrifugally-driven winds, lifting matter off the disk's\nsurface and channeling it down the magnetic field, are a proposed scenario for the origin\nof relativistic jets (Blandford & Payne 1982); at favorable orientations, these winds would\nlead to observable discrete absorption/emission features at soft X-rays (K\u00f6nigl & Kartje\n1994). A dense environment can also be responsible for slowing down the inner jet via\nmass entrainment inferred in more beamed sources (Georganopoulos & Kazanas 2003).\nUnification models for radio-loud sources also postulate the presence of a warm, scattering\ngas to explain type-2 sources (Urry & Padovani 1995).\nThe study of the gas environs of BLRGs would benefit from X-ray observations of a\nsource seen at optimal angles, such as to allow us to peek into the central engine while at\nthe same time minimizing the jet contribution. This opportunity is offered by 3C 445, a\nnearby (z=0.057) and X-ray bright, F2\u221210\n\nkeV\n\n\u223c 7 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , radio-loud source\n\noptically classified as a BLRG but with a large inclination angle as inferred from the radio\n(\u00a7 2). Previous ASCA observations suggest a heavily absorbed X-ray continuum (Sambruna\net al. 1998), similar to obscured radio-quiet AGN.\nHere we present and discuss an archival 15 ks XMM-Newton observation of 3C 445,\nwhich confirms its type-2 X-ray spectrum and shows the presence of a host of soft X-ray\nemission lines, for the first time in a radio-loud AGN. The paper is structured as follows.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe sources properties and the observations are summarized in \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. The results of\nthe spectral fits are presented in \u00a7 4, while discussion and conclusions follow in \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6.\nThroughout this paper, a concordance cosmology with H0 = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9\u039b =0.73,\nand \u03a9m =0.27 (Spergel et al. 2003) is adopted.\n\n2.\n\n3C 445\n\nThe nearby (z=0.057) radio galaxy 3C 445 has an FRII radio morphology (Kronberg,\nWielebinski, & Graham 1986), with a linear extension up to 10\u2032 . With a steep radio\nspectrum between 2.7 and 4.8 GHz (\u03b1r =0.7) and a core-to-lobe intensity ratio R=0.039\n(Morganti, Killeen, & Tadhunter 1993), the source is clearly lobe-dominated. From the\nprojected radio size of the source Eracleous & Halpern (1998) infer an inclination i > 60\u25e6 .\nUsing the ratio of the radio fluxes of the approaching (South) and receding (North) jets (\u223c\n7.7; Leahy et al. 1997), we derive an upper limit to the inclination angle i < 71\u25e6 (for p=3\nin eq. A10 of Urry & Padovani 1995). In the following we will assume i=60\u25e6 .\nBroad emission lines were observed in the optical unpolarized flux (Eracleous &\nHalpern 1994; Corbett al. 1998), leading to its classification as a BLRG. The spectrum is\nvery red, and steepens dramatically at UV energies (Crenshaw, Peteron, & Wagner 1988).\nIt has been suggested that the large IR emission is the result of the reprocessing of the\noptical and UV emission by circumnuclear dust (Elvis et al. 1984). The optical continuum\nis polarized (Brindle et al. 1990). The amount of reddening derived from the large Balmer\ndecrement (H\u03b1/H\u03b2 \u223c 8; Crenshaw et al. 1988, Osterbrock, Koski, & Phillips 1976) and by\nthe large Pa\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio (5.6; Rudy & Tokunaga 1982) is E(B-V)=1 mag. For a standard\ndust-to-gas conversion ratio a column density NH \u223c 5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 is derived. This is\none order of magnitude larger than the Galactic column density in the direction to the\n20\nsource, NGal\ncm\u22122 , derived from 21 cm measurements (Murphy et al. 1996).\nH = 5.33 \u00d7 10\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nBased on these properties, and on the limits to the viewing angle, we suggest we are seeing\n3C 445 almost edge-on. Thus, the beamed jet is not expected to contribute significantly\nto the emission from the source. In fact, for i=60\u25e6 and a bulk Lorentz factor \u0393J \u223c 10,\nthe Doppler factor of the jet is \u03b4 \u223c 0.2. Thus, the jet emission is actually de-boosted\n(FJ,obs = \u03b4 3+\u03b1 FJ,intr , where \u03b1 > 0 is the radio energy index; Urry & Padovani 1995).\nAt odds with its classification as a type-1 source, 3C 445 exhibits an X-ray spectrum\nvery similar to Seyfert 2s. Previous ROSAT and ASCA observations (Sambruna et al. 1998,\nS98 in the following), while of insufficient quality to allow a full spectral decomposition,\nindicated a heavily absorbed (NH \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 ) continuum above 3 keV, plus a narrow Fe\nK\u03b1 line with EW \u223c 250 eV, and a soft excess modeled with an unabsorbed power law.\nFrom a later reanalysis of the data, S99 noted weak emission lines below 2 keV in the\nnon-simultaneous ROSAT and ASCA data, attributed to ionized elements from O to Si.\nThe limited quality of the data, however, prevented a detailed analysis of the lines and their\norigin.\nMoreover, 3C 445 was detected with the Burst Alert Telescope onboard Swift in\nthe energy range 15\u2013150 keV (Tueller 2007, priv. comm.) and with the PDS onboard\nBeppoSAX (Grandi, Malaguti, & Fiocchi 2006; Dadina 2007). However, 3C 445 lies close\n(30\u2032 ) to the cluster of galaxies A2440 (z=0.094), and contamination of the hard X-ray flux\nby the cluster can not be ruled out in the BeppoSAX data. Nevertheless, the broad-band\nBeppoSAX spectrum was fitted with a partial-covering, dual-absorber model, yielding\n\u0393 = 1.7 and NH \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 . These data also gave the first measure of the reflection\ncontinuum (after subtraction of the expected cluster contribution); the latter is weakly\nconstrained, with reflection fraction R \u223c 3 and large uncertainties. Here, R = \u03a9/2\u03c0 is the\nfraction of the reflector's solid angle seen by the illuminating continuum (George & Fabian\n1991).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nThus, previous X-ray observations of 3C 445 provided tantalizing clues that the\n0.5\u201310 keV emission from this BLRG is complex. Moreover, analysis of the XMM-Newton\nfield of view of 3C 445 reveals the presence of a nearby (1.3\u2032 ) soft X-ray AGN (Grandi et\nal. 2004), which was not resolved at the ASCA and BeppoSAX poor angular resolutions.\nThus, the XMM-Newton observation presented here yields the very first high-quality X-ray\nspectrum of this source.\n\n3.\n\nObservations\n\nXMM-Newton observed 3C 445 on December 6, 2001 for a total exposure of 23.8 ks.\nAfter screening the data the net exposure, which includes correction for deadtimes, was\n15.3 ks with the EPIC pn, 21.3 ks with MOS1, and 21.2 ks with MOS2. The count rate of\nthe source in 0.4\u201310 keV is 0.59 \u00b1 0.006 c/s with the pn and 0.18 \u00b1 0.003 c/s with both\nMOS CCDs. With the RGS we collected a total of 280 counts with both instruments in the\nenergy range 0.4\u20132 keV.\nThe pn, MOS1, and MOS2 cameras were operating in Small Window mode, with\nthe Thin filter applied. The XMM-Newton data have been processed and cleaned using\nthe latest Science Analysis Software (SAS ver 7.0) and analyzed using standard software\npackages (FTOOLS ver. 6.1, XSPEC ver. 11.3). In order to define the threshold to filter\nfor high-background time intervals we extracted the 10\u201312 keV light curve and filtered out\nthe data when the light curve is 2\u03c3 above its mean. The inspection of this light curve shows\nthat there was no flaring activity during this observation. For our analysis only events\ncorresponding to pattern 0\u201312 for the EPIC MOS and pattern 0\u20134 for the pn were used.\nEPIC pn source spectra were extracted using a circular region of 30\u2032\u2032 , while background\ndata were extracted from a circular region with radius 1\u2032 centered at \u223c 2.5\u2032 from the source.\nThis is sufficient to include most of the PSF, while excluding the 1.3\u2032 X-ray source 1WGA\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nJ2223.7-0206 (Grandi et al. 2004). The EPIC MOS1 and MOS2 data were extracted using\na source extraction region of 30\u2032\u2032 radius and two background regions with identical size\n(30\u2032\u2032 ), selected on the nearby CCDs. Response matrices and ancillary response files at the\nsource position have been created using the sas tasks arfgen and rmfgen.\nThe EPIC MOS1 and MOS2 data were summed for the spectral fits and the\nbackground-subtracted spectrum binned to have at least 20 counts in each energy bin; the\nbackground-subtracted EPIC pn data were binned to have at least 30 counts per bin, to\nvalidate the use of the \u03c72 statistics. The spectra were fitted within XSPEC v. 11.3.2ad.\nFinally, we checked that there were no discrepancies between spectra extracted with this\nselection and spectra extracted with pattern 0.\n\n4.\n\nSpectral Fitting Results\n\nWe first fitted the EPIC pn and MOS spectra with a simple power law plus Galactic\nabsorption. As expected this was not a good fit (\u03c72r = 3.71/556), yielding a photon index\n\u0393 = \u22120.26. Figure 1 shows the data in the source's rest-frame, with the model removed for\nclarity. At energies above 3 keV, a curved continuum is visible indicating heavy absorption.\nThe Fe K\u03b1 line at 6.4 keV is also apparent. At soft X-rays, several emission features can\nbe seen in the energy range 0.4\u20132 keV, attributed to lighter elements from O to Si. In\nthe remainder of this section, all energies are in the source's rest-frame unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n4.1.\n\nThe Continuum\n>\n\nWe first concentrated on modeling the continuum. At the harder energies, \u223c 3 keV,\nthe bumpy shape of the continuum (Fig. 1) suggests heavy absorption, as in the previous\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nASCA observations (S98). Fitting the EPIC data in 3\u201310 keV with a single power law plus\nfree column density indeed yields significant absorption, N1H = 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 , with\n\u0393 = 1.27 \u00b1 0.13 and \u03c72r =1.2/386. The residuals of this model clearly show an emission line\nfeature at 6 keV (Fig. 1), identified with the Fe K\u03b1 line detected with ASCA (S98). Ignoring\nthe energy range 5\u20137 keV, where possible contributions from a broad relativistic Fe K\u03b1 line\nare often seen in Seyferts, yields an acceptable fit (\u03c72r = 1.0/228) but still an unusually\nhard continuum, \u0393h = 1.02 \u00b1 0.15, and excess column density NH = (9.6 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 .\nThus, the flat continuum slope above 3 keV is not an artifact of a complex profile of the Fe\nK\u03b1 line.\nFor the remaining of the spectral fits, we now consider the full 0.4\u201310 keV band with\nthe 5\u20137 keV bins added back. Addition of the lower energy bins shows that the 0.4\u20133 keV\nflux lies 2\u20133 orders of magnitude above the extrapolation of the absorbed power law,\nindicating the presence of a soft continuum component. This confirms the previous findings\nfrom ASCA and ROSAT joint fits, which required the presence of a steeper power law\nat the softer energies possibly related to scattering of the nuclear radiation by ambient\ngas/dust (S98). We thus added a second power law component to the fit, absorbed by a\ncolumn density N2H and with photon index \u0393s tied to the index of the hard power law,\n\u0393s = \u0393h . This fit yields \u03c72r = 1.57/553, still poor primarily because of unaccounted emission\nlines1 . The photon index is now \u0393s = \u0393h = 1.22 \u00b1 0.07, with an absorption column density\nN2H \u223c 6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 above the Galactic value acting mainly on the soft power law. Leaving\nthe soft and hard indices free to vary yields \u0393s = 1.44\u00b1 0.11 and \u0393h = 0.90\u00b1 0.13, both still\nquite flat, and \u03c72r = 1.54/552.\nThe presence of the Fe K\u03b1 emission line (see below) and the BeppoSAX PDS detection\nsuggest that addition of a reflection continuum might be necessary. We thus added cold\n1\n\nIf narrow Gaussians are added to model the X-ray lines (Table 2), the \u03c72r = 1.1/540.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nreflection modeled with pexrav (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995), where the abundances were\nfixed to solar values and the inclination angle i to 60\u25e6 . The free parameters of the fit were\nthe reflection fraction, R, and the normalization. The fit is greatly improved, \u2206\u03c72 =117,\nand yields very strong reflection, R \u223c 3. While not physical, taken at face value this would\n>\n\nindicate a strong reflection component dominating the emission at energies \u223c 8 keV.\nHowever, if we add a third layer of absorption to the model, specifically, a third power\nlaw with photon index tied to \u0393h and column density N3H , the strength of the reflection\ncomponent decreases, R \u223c 2, and N3H \u223c 4 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . Due to the limited EPIC bandpass\nand the complexity of the spectrum there is no simple way based on the data to decide\nwhether the 2\u201310 keV continuum is dominated by the reflection component, or if instead\nmultiple layers of absorption are present. Here we adopt the latter model, specifically, three\ndistinct cold absorbers and reflection (Table 1); as we discuss later, there is no evidence for\nthis source to be Compton-thick and thus dominated by reflection in the 2\u201310 keV energy\nband. Our approved Suzaku observations will allow us to discriminate among the various\npossibilities, which clearly have different physical implications, and measure the intrinsic\nAGN flux.\nThe best spectral decomposition of the 0.4\u201310 keV continuum is obtained with a model\nincluding: three powerlaws, all with the same photon index \u0393 \u223c 1.4, and two layers of cold\nabsorption, NH = 1022 \u2212 1023 cm\u22122 ; and strong (R \u223c 2) cold reflection. Figure 2 shows\nthe data fitted with the above model (and with the inclusion of the emission lines, see\nbelow), and the best-fit model itself. The best-fit parameters and their 90% uncertainty\nare reported in Table 1, where the observed fluxes and intrinsic (absorption-corrected)\nluminosities are also given. The covering fractions of the three cold absorbers are 84%\n(N1H ), 4% (N2H ), and 12% (N3H ).\nTo exclude that the line-like residuals at soft X-rays are due to inappropriate continuum\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nmodeling, we attempted fitting the EPIC spectrum with the baseline continuum model\nbut using an ionized reflector (reflion) instead of the cold one. This model is known\nfor producing relatively strong soft X-ray emission lines for intermediate ionization states\n(Ross, Fabian, & Young 1999). The fit with this model is worse by \u2206\u03c72 =30. Basically,\nthe model fails to account simultaneously for the various ionization properties at soft\nand hard X-rays. Specifically, accounting for the Mg and Si lines would require a strong\nhigh-ionization Fe line at 6.7\u20136.9 keV, which is not observed.\nNote that the measured continuum photon index is rather hard, \u0393 \u223c 1.4, flatter\nthan usually observed in Seyferts or other BLRGs. From a Suzaku observation of 3C 120,\nKataoka et al. (2007) derive \u0393 \u223c 1.7, similar to what was obtained from ASCA observations\nof BLRGs (S99). The limited EPIC bandpass, together with the presence of complex\nabsorption, most likely conjures to produce an apparently hard continuum. Fixing \u0393 to\n1.7, in fact, yields an equivalent fit, with an increase of the column densities of 20%. This\nreflects the well-known spectral degeneracy between slope and absorption column over a\nlimited bandpass (< 10 keV).\nThe total observed fluxes, F0.4\u22122\n\nkeV\n\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221213 and F2\u221210\n\nkeV\n\n\u223c 7 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg\n\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , are clearly lower limits to the true AGN fluxes in these energy bands, and fully\nconsistent with the fluxes measured with ASCA and ROSAT (S98). A 2\u201310 keV observed\nflux lower by a factor 2 was measured in earlier BeppoSAX observations2 (Grandi et al.\n2006). Thus, there is evidence that the medium-hard X-ray flux varied significantly over the\ntimescale of almost 2 years between the BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton observing epochs.\n2\n\nNote, however, that the BeppoSAX and ASCA datasets contained a (presumably small)\n\ncontribution from the 1.3\u2032 source; thus, the factor 2 variations between the BeppoSAX and\nXMM-Newton epochs is clearly a lower limit.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nExtrapolating the best-fit model at harder X-ray energies, we find a 15\u2013100 keV\nobserved flux of F15\u2212100\n\nkeV\n\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . This is a factor 2 larger than the\n\nBAT flux threshold, and consistent with the claimed detection.\n\n4.2.\n\nThe Fe line region\n\nIn Figure 3a we plot the residuals of the baseline best-fit continuum model discussed\nabove (a power law with three absorbers plus cold reflection), zooming in the Fe K\u03b1\nemission line region. These residuals were obtained by fitting the full-band EPIC data\nminus the 5\u20137 keV region, and then adding back the 5\u20137 keV for the plot.\nThe prominent emission line at 6.4 keV is the Fe K\u03b1 emission line, present both the\npn and MOS data (Fig. 1). Adding a Gaussian improves the fit significantly, \u2206\u03c72 =57\nfor 3 additional parameters. The line is narrow, \u03c3 = 70+49\n\u221269 eV, and unresolved at > 95%\nconfidence; its observed Equivalent Width against the total continuum is EW \u223c 120 eV\n(Table 2), while the EW with respect to the reflection continuum only is 524+173\n\u2212165 eV. Adding\na broad Gaussian to the narrow line does not improve the fit and its width is completely\nunconstrained. Figure 3b shows the residuals after fitting a narrow Gaussian.\nThe measured EW with respect to the total observed continuum is by itself suggestive\nof a strong reflection component (George & Fabian 1991). Indeed, the intensity of the Fe\nK\u03b1 line depends at first order on the amount of reflection, the iron abundance, and the\ninclination angle. Taking into account the limited bandpass of XMM-Newton, the well\nknown degeneracy between R and \u0393, and the complex absorption in this source, the amount\nof reflection cannot be directly derived from the continuum itself. However, assuming an\ninclination angle of 60\u25e6 , solar abundances, and an intrinsic \u0393 of 1.4 the ratio between the Fe\nK\u03b1 emission line and the reflected component is expected to be 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 . From our best\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nfit we derive a ratio of about \u223c 0.01, close to the expected value. On the other hand, if the\nnormalization of the Fe line and the reflection continuum are linked together the residuals\nin 5\u20137 keV are flat and no additional broad or narrow components to the Fe K\u03b1 emission\nline are required.\nIn both Figure 3a-b, an absorption feature is present around 6.8 keV. The dip was\nmodeled with an inverted Gaussian, leading to a modest (\u2206\u03c72 =10) improvement of the fit,\nsignificant at \u223c 97% confidence from the F-test. The fitted energy and EW are E=6.87 \u00b1\n0.09 keV and EW=40+22\n\u221225 eV. If the absorption feature is real, the closest candidate for its\nidentification would be the 1\u21922 transition of FeXXV at 6.701 keV, blueshifted by a modest\namount, v \u223c 0.02c. The EW would imply a column density NH \u223c 1022 cm\u22122 . However,\nthe feature significance is hindered by the choice of the underlying continuum model; a\nstronger reflection component would reduce the significance of the dip. This is because of\nthe correlation between \u0393 and R: a stronger reflection component would allow the slope to\nbecome slightly steeper, decreasing the contrast between the continuum and the absorption\nfeatures.\n\n4.3.\n\nSoft X-ray Emission Lines\n\nAt softer energies, several emission lines are present in 0.4\u20131 keV and further around\n2 keV (Figure 1). We interpret these features as emission lines due to the lighter elements\nfrom O to Si. Table 2 lists the observed line energies, fluxes, EWs, and their identifications.\nThe lack of a strong FeL complex at 0.9\u20131 keV provides evidence against an origin\nof the X-ray lines in collisionally ionized gas, such as the galaxy ISM. Adding a thermal\nmodel (apec) to the best-fit model yields \u03c72r =1.09/544, and leaves line-like residuals at\n0.7 and 0.8 keV, and at 1.3 and 1.8 keV. The fitted temperature is kT \u223c 0.12 keV, with\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nabundances \u223c 0.7 solar. Previous ROSAT PSPC data showed the source is consistent with\nbeing point-like (S98), although higher-resolution Chandra data are needed to confirm this\nresult.\nA strong possibility is an ionized medium, most likely photoionized by the intense\nnuclear light, as commonly observed in Seyfert galaxies. Indeed, we detect two emission\nfeatures at 0.74 and 0.87 keV which could be interpreted as the Radiative Recombination\nContinuum (RRC) of OVII and OVIII, respectively (Table 2). The RRC features link\nunequivocally the origin of the emission lines to a plasma photoionized by the AGN,\ngenerally at a temperature of a few eV (Liedahl & Paerels 1996). At the EPIC resolution\nthe RRC features are unresolved. In the case of OVII RRC, a contribution to the flux from\nthe nearby (\u2206\u03bb = 0.299 \u00c5) FeXVII 3s-2p line can not be excluded; usually, however, the\nOVII RRC is much brighter (factor 2 or more) than FeXVII (Kinkhabwala et al. 2002).\nWe thus added a photoionization model component to describe the soft X-rays, using\nthe code XSTAR (Bautista & Kallman 2001). The latter describes the emission lines expected\nfrom a medium whose physical conditions are summarized in the ionization parameter\n\u03be = Lph /nr 2 ergs cm/s, where Lph is the luminosity of the photoionizing continuum, n\nthe gas density, and r its distance from the nucleus. Other parameters are the element\nabundances relative to solar, the column density of the gas, NW\nH , and the normalization.\nSince the model is clearly underconstrained by the data, we fixed the elemental abundances\nto their best-fit values (consistent with solar within the uncertainties), and the column\n21\ndensity to NW\ncm\u22122 , similar to the columns observed in Seyfert 1s (Reynolds 1997).\nH = 10\n\nLeaving NW\nH free to vary does not improve or change the fit, and furthermore, the value is\nunconstrained. Only the ionization parameter and the normalization were left free to vary.\nWe find that the EPIC data require two separate media, one with ionization parameter\nlog \u03be1 \u223c 1.9, accounting for most of the O and Ne lines, and a second one with log \u03be2 \u223c\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\u20130.09, responsible for the Mg and Si lines. The addition of a second ionized medium is\nsignificant at > 99.9% confidence (\u2206\u03c72 = 22 for 2 additional parameters). As discussed\nelsewhere (NGC 4507; Matt et al. 2004) the need for two ionization parameters does not\nimply that the media are physically separate; in fact, they could represent two different\nzones of the same cloud. The parameters of the best-fit model with XSTAR are reported in\nTable 1, and the model is shown in Figure 2. The individual lines fluxes and EWs are listed\nin Table 2.\nAlbeit the low quality of the RGS data (\u00a7 3), we inspected the RGS1, 2 spectra to\nsearch for the brightest emission lines. The data are very noisy and affected by large (50%\nor more) errorbars; only a slight hint (1\u03c3) for a possible line at 0.57 keV is present, with a\ntotal of 10 counts in the feature. Thus, we will not discuss the RGS data any further.\nIn conclusion, an archival 15 ks EPIC observation of 3C 445 provides evidence for a\nvery complex X-ray spectrum. In particular, several X-ray emission lines are present in\n0.4\u20132 keV, most likely due to a photoionized gas. To our knowledge, this is the first time\nthat soft X-ray emission lines are detected in a radio-loud AGN. The presence of X-ray lines\nfrom 3C 445 was previously claimed based on non-simultaneous ROSAT and ASCA spectra\n(S99), which also indicated a heavily absorbed continuum. In addition to confirming these\nfeatures, the EPIC data also provide evidence for a strong reflection continuum and/or\nseveral layers of cold absorption of the power law continuum.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOverall, the X-ray spectrum of 3C 445 is remarkably similar to a Seyfert 2, at odds with\nits classification as type-1 AGN. The EPIC spectrum indicates a strong, albeit uncertain\nwithout hard X-ray observations, reflection component which is expected to dominate\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nthe continuum above 10 keV, and indeed 3C 445 was detected with the BAT and PDS\nexperiments. Given the large inclination angle of the radio source (\u00a7 2), it is quite possible\nthat the Compton hump is due to reflection off a medium along the line of sight (the\ntorus wall?). The Fe K\u03b1 line is narrow, with no evidence for a broad component linked to\nthe disk. Its EW \u223c 120 eV is consistent with being produced by both transmission and\n>\n\nreflection through a cold medium with column NH \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 (Turner et al. 1997).\nAlternatively, the requirement in the EPIC data of an unusually strong reflection\ncomponent is alleviated by adding multiple cold absorbers to the continuum model (\u00a7 4.1).\nThis scenario would imply the presence of different layers of absorption, which could\npossibly totally obscure the primary nuclear X-ray continuum in the EPIC bandpass.\nTo this regard, we tested the possibility that 3C 445 is Compton-thick, i.e., there is yet\n>\n\nanother, unaccounted absorber, NH \u223c 1024 cm\u22122 , using the diagnostic diagram of Bassani\net al. (1999). This is a plot of the Fe K\u03b1 EW versus the thickness parameter T, defined as\nthe ratio of the total 2\u201310 keV flux of the source and the intrinsic [OIII] flux (Bassani et\nal. 1999). In this plot, Compton-thick sources tend to occupy the region of large EW and\nsmall T values.\nThe observed [OIII] flux of 3C 445 is Fobs [OIII] = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Tadhunter\net al. 1998). Correcting for the reddening using the observed Balmer decrement (\u00a7 2), the\nintrinsic flux is Fobs [OIII] = 3 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . From the 2\u201310 keV flux in Table 1, the\nT parameter is T=2.2. This value and the Fe K\u03b1 EW \u223c 120 eV (Table 1) place 3C 445 in\nthe region of AGN with absorption column densities NH \u223c 1022 \u2212 1023 cm\u22122 in Figure 1 of\nBassani et al. (1999), near the Seyfert 1s locus. For comparison, the two radio-loud sources\nin the sample of Bassani et al., Cyg A and NGC 6251, have EW=380 eV and T=22, and\nEW=390 eV and T=2, respectively; they are located among (NGC 6251) or close (Cyg A)\nto the Seyferts. Thus, there is no evidence based on the presently available data that\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n3C 445 is Compton-thick.\nPerhaps the most striking result of the EPIC data analysis is the detection of X-ray\nemission lines below 2 keV. Again, this is similar to what generally found in obscured\nradio-quiet AGN (Turner et al. 1997, Guainazzi et al. 2005), where photoionization\nis generally dominant but with a non-negligible contribution from resonant scattering\n(Kinkhabwala et al. 2002). Indeed, the EPIC spectrum of 3C 445 is very similar to the\nCompton-thin Seyfert 2 NGC 4507, where emission lines from ionized O, Ne, Mg, and Si\n(as well as a strongly absorbed continuum) were detected with XMM-Newton with similar\nEWs (Matt et al. 2004). As in the case of NGC 4507, two ionized emitters or a single\nemitter with a range of ionization parameters are required for 3C 445. The ionization\nparameters we measure for 3C 445 (Table 1) are within the range (\u03be 1 ) or slightly lower (\u03be 2 )\nthan typically found for type-2 Seyferts (e.g., Kinkhabwala et al. 2002).\nWe conclude that the central engine of 3C 445 hosts a warm gas with properties similar\nto radio-quiet obscured AGN, which is responsible for the observed soft X-ray lines, most\nlikely through scattering. The location of this \"warm mirror\" remains unknown with the\npresent data. Using Chandra and HST [OIII] images, Bianchi, Guainazzi, & Chiaberge\n(2006) showed that the soft X-ray emission of obscured radio-quiet AGN is extended and\nspatially coincident with the NLR. Unfortunately, no Chandra images are yet available\nto test this hypothesis in the case of 3C 445. Based on the fact that we can see the soft\nX-ray lines, we can at least locate the warm mirror further out from the cold gas affecting\nthe continuum emission (Matt et al. 2004). Another possibility is an outflow extending\nvertically above the plane of the torus, particularly intriguing given the radio-loud nature\nof 3C 445 and the presence of a radio jet (see below).\nFrom the EPIC best-fit model, we calculated an upper limit to the distance r of\nthe warm gas from the black hole, using the gas parameters from Table 1. Under the\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nassumption that the gas forms a thin shell, \u2206r/r < 1, for a nuclear ionizing (corrected for\nabsorption) luminosity Lph = L0.4\u2212100\n\nkeV\n\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . Assuming that the medium\n\nhas a density similar to the BLRs (n = 109 cm\u22123 ), r = 0.02 \u2212 0.2 pc. At these distances\nthe gas velocity should be v \u223c 5,000\u201316,000 km/s for a black hole mass 109 M\u2299 . If instead\nn = 103 cm\u22123 , consistent with the NLRs, then r > 10 pc and v < 500 km/s. These scenarios\ncan be tested with high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy which will resolve the individual\nlines yielding the density and location of the photoionized gas, and will measure intrinsic\nvelocity dispersions/energy shifts.\nThe covering fraction of the soft X-ray emitting gas can also be calculated from\nthe normalization (luminosity) of the photoionized emission modeled by XSTAR. The\nphotoionized matter may exist in a shell of gas around the photoionizing AGN source,\ncovering a fraction (f ) of 4\u03c0 sr\u22121 solid angle. From the XSTAR code, the normalization (k)\n2\nof a component of photoionized gas is related to the covering fraction by f = Dkpc\nk/Lph ,\n\nwhere Dkpc is the distance to 3C 445 in kpc and Lph is the ionizing luminosity in units\nof 1038 erg s\u22121 . From above, Lph = 3 \u00d7 106 erg s\u22121 , while D 2 = 6 \u00d7 1010 kpc2 . From the\nXSTAR fits, the luminosity of the photoionized emission corresponds to Lphoto = 6 \u00d7 1041 erg\ns\u22121 , with approximately equal contribution from the high and low ionization zones, while\nthe XSTAR normalization corresponds to k = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 (with an uncertainty\n21\nof \u223c 50%) for an assumed column density NW\ncm\u22122 . Thus this translates into a\nH = 10\n21\ncovering fraction f \u223c 40% for NW\ncm\u22122 . If the assumed column density is higher,\nH = 10\n22\ncm\u22122 , then the required covering fraction is correspondingly lower, e.g., f \u223c 4%.\nNW\nH = 10\n\nGiven that by definition f < 1, the lower limit on the column density of the soft X-ray\nemitting gas is > 4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 at a maximum distance of < 5 kpc.\nIn any event, a more accurate estimate of the covering fraction of the photoionized gas\ncannot be made without a measurement of the ionized column of gas in absorption against\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nthe direct continuum emission. This may be achievable in the forthcoming long Suzaku\nobservation of 3C 445, through refinement of the measurement of the possible Fe XXV\nabsorption line near 6.8 keV, or from the possible detection of softer absorption lines from\nHe/H-like Si and S near 2 keV.\nThe detection of soft X-ray lines in 3C 445 has implications for other BLRGs in the\ncontext of unification models. In radio-quiet Seyferts, the \"warm mirror\", is commonly\nunified with the ionized outflows producing the absorption features observed in the soft\nX-ray spectra of type-1 objects, the \"warm absorber\" (Netzer 1996). Assuming that the\ngeneral unification scenario of Seyferts holds for radio-loud AGN as well (Urry & Padovani\n1995), and that 3C 445 is fairly representative of other radio-loud AGN, one can infer\nthat a warm absorbing gas should be present in the more aligned counterparts of 3C 445,\nproducing absorption features at soft X-rays. If this is indeed the case, one may wonder\nwhy these features were not detected in BLRGs.\nThe answer is twofold. On one hand, there are only four bright BLRGs traditionally\nknown: 3C 120, 3C 382, 3C 390.3, and 3C 111, all of them observed extensively at X-rays.\nBoth superluminal sources 3C 120 and 3C 111 lie at low Galactic latitudes, preventing a\ndetailed study of the emission below 2 keV. In addition, 3C 120 displays a variable soft\nexcess attributed to the jet (Kataoka et al. 2007); unless the absorber subtends a large\nsolid angle to the jet (e.g., entrained matter), any absorption feature will be weak and\ndifficult to detect against the beamed non-thermal continuum. In 3C 382 the soft excess is\nalso variable (Barr & Giommi 1992), and contributions to the soft X-rays from the diffuse\ncircumnuclear thermal emission (Gliozzi et al. 2007) could mask weak absorption features.\nOn the other hand, deep X-ray observations of BLRGs with a signal-to-noise ratio\ncomparable to Seyfert 1s were never performed in the past. High-resolution grating\nobservations of BLRGs so far exist only for 3C 382 (HETGS, 120 ks) and 3C 390.3 (RGS,\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n90 ks). In the former, two emission lines at \u223c 0.89 and 1.04 keV were marginally detected\n(Gliozzi et al. 2007) but their origin is not clear due to the limited quality of the MEG\ndata.\nThe best candidate BLRG for the detection of absorption features is arguably 3C 390.3.\nIn fact, this galaxy has a low (NH = 3.7 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ) Galactic column, a relatively large\nX-ray flux (F2\u221210\n\nkeV\n\n\u223c 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), and a powerlaw continuum (S99). Previous\n\nX-ray observations of 3C 390.3, however, provide controversial evidence for the presence of\nabsorption. A variable column density of cold gas was observed in multiepoch X-ray spectra\nof this BLRG (Grandi et al. 1999), while a 40 ks ASCA spectrum provided evidence for\nan absorption edge at 0.74 eV with optical depth \u03c4 \u223c 0.3, identified eith the OVII edge\nat 0.739 eV (S99). However, no apparent absorption but instead weak emission lines were\ndetected at soft X-rays in a 90 ks XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS exposure (Lewis et al.\n2007, in prep.), confirmed in our recently acquired Suzaku data (Sambruna et al. 2007, in\nprep.).\nWe now comment on the apparent discrepancy of the X-ray spectrum with the optical\ntype-1 classification of 3C 445. This difficulty may be circumvented in the \"clumpy\nhydromagnetic wind\" torus model of Elitzur & Shloshman (2007; see also K\u00f6nigl & Kartje\n1994, Everett 2005). In this model, the torus is not a continuous, donut-like structure but\nis composed of clouds distributed around the equatorial plane of the AGN (see Fig. 3 in\nElitzur 2006); the torus extends in the inner regions beyond the dust sublimation radius,\nwhere the clouds become atomic and ionized yielding broad optical lines and warm X-ray\nabsorption. For a given number of clouds and their distribution on the equatorial plane,\nclassification of an AGN as type 1 or 2 depends on whether the line of sight intercepts\nenough obscuring clouds.\nThe multiwavelength properties of 3C 445 can be reconciled within this scenario. The\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ninclination angle of 3C 445 from the radio is larger (\u00a7 2) than the current estimates of the\naverage opening cone of the \"torus\", \u223c 30 \u2212 45\u25e6 (Schmitt et al. 2001), implying we might\nbe looking at the nucleus of 3C 445 through significant number of clouds. Our line of sight\ncould be such to be obscured by matter in the outer, colder (NH \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 ) molecular\nclouds of the toroidal distribution, while at the same time intercepting the broad emission\nlines from innermost ionized BLR clouds if the latter are lifted at some height above\nthe plane (Elitzur & Shlosman 2007). The BLR clouds could also be responsible for the\nlower column density, N1H \u223c 6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , and, via scattering, the soft X-ray continuum\n(Table 1). The external dustier clouds would be responsible for the observed continuum\nand H\u03b1 polarization, as well as for the strong IR continuum emission.\nThe clumpy wind scenario provides a viable scenario also for the X-ray emission lines\nfrom 3C 445. K\u00f6nigl & Kartje (1994) suggested that the X-ray warm absorber/emitter\nobserved in Seyferts coincides with clouds uplifted from the surface of the accretion disk\nby the magnetic field in a hydromagnetically driven sub-relativistic outflow (Blandford &\nPayne 1982). Indeed, X-ray observations at moderate-to-high spectral resolution of Seyferts\n1/2 detected signatures of winds. A large proportion of these sources exhibit soft X-ray\nabsorption lines blueshifted relative to systemic, indicative of low-velocity, \u223c 1,000 km/s,\n>\n\noutflows; at larger luminosities, fast outflows (v \u223c 0.1c) were observed in a small number\nof systems on the basis of FeK absorption features (see Braito et al. 2007 and references\ntherein).\nIn the clumpy wind model the conditions for developing such an outflow become\nparticularly favorable toward the inner parts of the disk (Elitzur & Shlosman 2007). From\nthis perspective, it is tantalizing to speculate that the X-ray emission lines observed from\n3C 445 originate from an inner outflow component, perhaps related to the formation of the\nradio jet itself (Blandford & Payne 1982; K\u00f6nigl & Kartje 1994; Proga et al. 2000). The\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nEPIC data, however, do not provide conclusive evidence for the presence of an outflow in\n3C 445. A weak absorption feature is observed at 6.8 keV, but its significance is hindered\nby the choice of the underlying continuum model (\u00a7 4.2).\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing an archival 15 ks XMM-Newton spectrum we have shown that the X-ray emission\nfrom the nearby BLRG 3C 445 is quite complex. In particular, its properties are remarkably\nsimilar to those of type-2 radio-quiet AGN, with a heavily absorbed continuum and a strong\nreflection component, a narrow Fe K\u03b1 emission line, and several soft X-ray lines consistent\nwith reflection/scattering off a warm \"mirror\".\nThe soft X-ray lines are of particular interest, as this is the first time that such features\nare detected in a BLRG and indeed in a radio-loud AGN. Again, their properties are similar\nto radio-quiet Seyfert 2s. The most likely origin of the lines is from a photoionized gas close\nto the nucleus. Follow-up X-ray spectroscopy of 3C 445 with higher resolution is strongly\nencouraged to determine the location and density of the warm medium.\nIf unification models hold, and if 3C 445 is representative of radio-loud AGN, one\nwould expect to observe absorption features from the same \"warm mirror\" in BLRGs more\nfavorably oriented close to the line of sight. So far, such features have eluded detection.\nFuture high-quality X-ray observations of radio-loud AGN of both type 1 and 2 are needed\nto investigate the gas content of these systems.\n\nThis research has made use of data obtained from the High Energy Astrophysics\nScience Archive Research Center (HEASARC), provided by NASA's Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, and of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) which is operated by the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.
