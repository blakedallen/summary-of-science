It also shows some promise for the\nfuture development of gas sensors for \"electronic noses\".\nHowever, the systematic experimental investigation of\nthe influence of single gas molecules on charge transport through metallic atomic contacts started only a few\nyears ago with hydrogen in atomic platinum contacts.2,3\nIt was found that the zero-bias conductance through\nsuch platinum-hydrogen contacts tends to be close to the\nquantum of conductance G0 = 2e2 /h. In addition, this\nconductance value is due to a single, almost fully transparent channel.2,4 Theoretical work has mostly confirmed\nthese findings.3,5,6,7,8\nEven so, one of the main problems in experiments of\nthis type is to know if and in which configuration gas\nmolecules are present in the contact region. A definite\nidentification of the presence and the type of gas can\nbe based on statistical techniques, such as the measurement of conductance histograms.2,9 For individual contacts, this becomes much harder. In the experiments of\nRefs. 2,3 the identification of a single hydrogen molecule\nwas based on the so-called inelastic point contact spectroscopy, where the local vibrational modes can be seen\nin the current-voltage (I-V ) characteristics as abrupt features at bias voltages corresponding to the energies of the\nvibrations.9 The evolution of these features with stretch-\n\ning of the contacts can then be compared to calculations of the vibrational modes for given configurations\nof the molecule.2,3 In fact, theoretical methods have recently been developed that enable a direct comparison\nbetween the full experimental and theoretical I-V characteristics, including the inelastic signatures of the vibrational modes.10,11,12,13,14,15\nFor this purpose, namely to identify small molecules in\natomic metal contacts through transport measurements,\nwe study the general properties of oxygen (O) in atomic\naluminum (Al) contacts. In this paper we concentrate\non the behavior of the zero-bias transport characteristics\nwhen the atomic contacts are stretched. In the spirit of\nRefs. 2,3,6, we also study the evolution and character of\nthe vibrational modes. Aluminum was chosen, because\nit becomes superconducting below temperatures of 1 K.\nAs a result, in addition to measurements of the total\nzero-bias conductance, it is possible to determine experimentally the transmission eigenvalues of the individual\nchannels from the I-V characteristics in the superconducting state.16 As particular examples, we study single\noxygen atoms (O), oxygen dimers (O2 ), and ozone (O3 ).\nThese molecules (we also refer to the oxygen atom as a\nmolecule) are placed initially in the middle of the contact between two aluminum electrodes, since their effect\non the transport properties is then at its largest. We describe our contacts at the level of density-functional theory (DFT). In particular, the DFT electronic structure\nis employed to determine the charge transport properties\nby means of Green's function techniques.\nIn the following we present stable structures of the\nthree types of contacts, where oxygen molecules bridge\n\n\f2\nthe gap between two idealized aluminum electrodes. For\nthem, we calculate the vibrational modes and the lowtemperature transport properties, including the characterization of the individual transmission channels. We\nfind that both the energies of the vibrational modes, as\nwell as the evolution of the conductance with increasing\nelectrode distance show qualitatively comparable characteristics for the three investigated molecules. In contrast\nto pure Al, the conductances of the Al-Ox -Al contacts\nare always well below 1G0 , and for an increasing number\nof O atoms, the conductance decreases. Moreover, the\nexponential decay lengths in the tunneling regime are\ndifferent in the presence and in the absence of oxygen.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we begin by presenting the methods used for determining the\nelectronic structure, the geometries, and the transport\nproperties of the molecular contacts. In Sec. III we then\ndescribe the optimized geometries and the corresponding\nvibrational modes. Following this, Sec. IV relates in detail the transmission properties of the junctions to the\nrelevant molecular orbitals. The section ends with an\nanalysis of the evolution of the conductances when the\ncontacts are opened. In particular, we analyze the tunneling regime, which is discussed further in App. A. In\nSec. V we conclude with the discussion of our results.\n\nII.\n\nMETHOD\n\nIn this section we briefly present our methods for computing the electronic structures, geometries, vibrational\nmodes, as well as the charge transport characteristics of\natomic contacts. A more detailed account will be given\nelsewhere.17\nWe describe our contacts at the level of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) as implemented in the quantum chemistry package Turbomole v5.7 (Refs. 18,19,\n20,21). In particular, we use the \"ridft\" module22,23\nwith the BP86 exchange correlation functional24,25 and\na Gaussian basis set of split valence plus polarization\n(SVP) quality.26 To be precise, polarization functions are\npresent on all non-hydrogen atoms within the employed\nbasis set. The total energy is converged to a precision\nof 10\u22126 Hartree. Geometry optimization is performed\nuntil the maximum norm of the Cartesian gradient has\nfallen below 10\u22124 atomic units. Vibrational modes in\nour contacts are determined using the \"aoforce\" module\nof Turbomole.27,28,29\nThe investigated atomic contacts consist of two atomically sharp electrode tips and a single oxygen molecule\nconnecting them (Fig. 1). The electrodes are Al fcc pyramids oriented in the (111) direction with a lattice constant of 4.05 \u00c5 and consist of at least four layers. While\nthe outer layers are kept fixed all the time, the inner two\nlayers of the freestanding pyramids are relaxed to find\nan energy minimum. Afterwards the atoms in the Al\npyramids are kept fixed. Between two such electrodes\nwe place one representative oxygen molecule (O, O2 , or\n\nO3 ). The molecule is then relaxed between the fixed\nelectrodes, leading to a stable configuration. Starting\nfrom this first configuration, we move the electrodes stepwise further away from each other and relax the oxygen\nmolecule again in each step. For each relaxed structure\nwe determine the vibrational modes of the molecule connected to the leads.\nTo compute the charge transport through a molecule\nbetween metallic electrodes, we apply a method based on\nstandard Green's function techniques and the Landauer\nformula expressed in terms of a local non-orthogonal\nbasis.11,30,31,32,33,34 Due to the locality of the basis, the\nsystem is conveniently separated into three parts, leading\nto a single-particle Hamiltonian (or Fock matrix) of the\nmolecular junction that has the following form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nH LL H LC H LR\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(1)\nH = \uf8edH CL H CC H CR \uf8f8 .\nH RL H RC H RR\nHere H CC describes the central system (C) consisting of\nthe molecule and the tips of the electrodes and H XX\nwith X = L, R describe the left (L) and right (R)\nelectrodes. The matrices H LC = H TCL etc. give the\nhopping elements between the different subsystems, but\nthe hoppings between L and R are assumed to vanish\n(H LR = H RL = 0). This assumption has been verified in all our calculations, where the Hamiltonian elements connecting L and R were always smaller than 10\u22126\nHartree. The overlap matrix S of the non-orthogonal basis has a similar structure.\nThe conductances of the molecular junctions are determined by means of Green's function techniques. The\nlow-temperature zero-bias conductance G = dI/dV |V =0\nis given by the Landauer formula\nG = G0 Tr[t(EF )t\u2020 (EF )] = G0 T (EF ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere t(EF ) is the transmission matrix of the molecular\njunction evaluated at the Fermi energy EF . The total\ntransmission\nat any energy E can be written as T (E) =\nP\u221e\nT\n(E),\nwhere Tn (E) are the transmissions of the\nn\nn=1\nindividual eigenchannels, defined as the eigenvalues of\nt(E)t\u2020 (E).

The order from top to bottom corresponds to an order from left to right in the figure.\n\nsurfaces. These self-energies contain all the information\nabout the electronic structure of the electrodes and their\ncoupling to the central system.\nThe electronic structure of the central system and its\ncoupling to the electrodes are obtained from the calculated geometries (Fig. 1). Let us refer to these geometries, which consist of the two pyramids bridged by a\nmolecule, as \"contact geometries\". These contact geometries are divided into three parts. The central part,\ncorresponding to region C in the transport calculation,\nconsists of the molecule and the inner two layers of the\npyramids. The excluded outer layers on the left and right\nsides are used for calculating the hoppings and overlaps\nbetween the central region and the electrodes as needed\nin Eq. (5).\nTo obtain the surface Green's functions g rXX (E), we\ncompute separately the electronic structure of a spherical Al fcc cluster with 555 atoms. From this we extract the Fock and overlap matrix elements between the\natom in the origin of the cluster and all its neighbors\nand, using these \"bulk parameters\", construct a semiinfinite periodic crystal. The surface Green's functions\nare then calculated from this crystal using the so-called\ndecimation technique.36 We have checked that the electrode construction in the employed non-orthogonal SVP\n\nbasis set has converged with respect to the size of the\nAl cluster, from which we extract our parameters.17 In\nthis way we describe the whole system consistently within\nDFT, using the same basis set and exchange-correlation\nfunctional everywhere.\nThe Fermi energy EF of the coupled system, namely\nthe C part connected to the semi-infinite electrodes, required to determine the conductance [Eq. (2)], is assumed\nto be given by the Al leads. We obtain its value as the\naverage of the energies of the highest occupied (\u22124.261\neV) and the lowest unoccupied (\u22124.245 eV) orbitals of\nthe bulk cluster. In this way we find EF = \u22124.25 eV.\nThe same quantity for the contact geometries deviates\nfrom this bulk value by less than 0.08 eV. Let us stress\nthat the Fermi energy is only used to read off the conductance from a transmission function T (E), but does not\nenter into our calculations otherwise.\nIII.\n\nCONTACT GEOMETRIES AND\nVIBRATIONAL MODES\n\nWe simulate the opening of a contact for the three most\nbasic forms of oxygen (O, O2 , and O3 ).

The arrows and plus/minus signs denote the directions of relative displacements\nof the atoms in a given mode: \u2192 and \u2190 denote motion along the axis of the contact while +,\u2212 and \u2191,\u2193 denote motion in\nthe two directions perpendicular to the axis.\n\nconfiguration, one halfway, the one just before, and the\none directly after the breaking. In the case of a single O\natom, the O sits at first on the side of the Al dimer contact. Upon stretching this atom moves onto the contact\naxis and stays symmetrically bonded to both pyramids\nuntil the contact breaks [Fig. 1(a)]. When the contact is\nbroken, the oxygen atom binds to one electrode with a\ndistance of approximately 1.7 \u00c5 on top of the pyramid\nand stays bonded like this. However, this binding position is only metastable. If one distorts the position of\nthe oxygen atom slightly, e.g. places it at some distance\nfrom the contact axis and optimizes the contact geometry again, the atom goes to one side of the pyramid in\nthe same way as for O2 and O3 described below. This\nposition with the oxygen bonded to one side of the pyramid is energetically favored by approximately 2.5 eV. In\nthe case of O2 , the molecular axis of the oxygen molecule\nis in the beginning almost perpendicular to the contact\naxis and rotates afterwards into this axis [Fig. 1(b)]. For\nO3 , the molecule is twisted around the contact axis. This\ntwist contracts towards the contact axis when the contact\nis stretched [Fig. 1(c)]. In the cases of Al-O2 /O3 -Al, the\nO atoms move always to the sides of the pyramids when\nthe contact is broken. The evolution of the distances between the atoms while opening the contact is shown in\nTab. I.\nAs mentioned above, in order to compare with results\nfrom inelastic transport experiments, we also calculate\nthe vibrational modes of the oxygen molecules in the contact. Since the atomic mass of Al is almost twice as large\nas that of O, it is a reasonable first approximation to\nneglect the motion of the Al atoms, which is what our\nmodel assumes. The energies of the vibrational modes\nfor the different structures are shown in Fig. 2. For these\nstructures, the modes can be classified roughly as being\nlongitudinal or transverse, according to the motions of\nthe atoms relative to the axis of the contact. The mode\nenergies are in the range of 50 meV to 140 meV for Al-OAl. The two transverse modes are more or less constant\n\naround 50 meV, while the longitudinal mode increases\nfrom 120 meV to a maximum of 140 meV at a distance\nof 3.3 \u00c5 and drops afterwards almost linearly. For Al-O2 Al, the mode energies are in the range of 40 meV to 150\nmeV. The two lowest modes are transverse and constant\nin energy. The highest mode is longitudinal and increases\nfrom 135 meV to 150 meV at 4.5 \u00c5 and drops afterwards\nto 120 meV. The other three modes lie in the range of\n70 meV to 110 meV. For Al-O3 -Al, the lowest (transverse) modes lie constant at an energy of approximately\n25 meV. The highest (longitudinal) mode increases first\nto its maximum of 160 meV at 5.4 \u00c5 and decreases afterwards. Another mode lies close to this highest one.\nAll other modes have energies between 50 meV and 120\nmeV.\nThe behavior of the vibrational energies can be understood by re-examining the atomic distances in the geometries (Tab. I). Despite the fact that the atomic contacts\nare being stretched, it happens for example that in the\nbeginning some atoms move closer together. Therefore\ncertain bonds strengthen due to this bond shortening,\nand corresponding modes may show an initial increase in\ntheir vibrational frequencies.\n\nIV.\n\nTRANSPORT PROPERTIES AND\nELECTRONIC STRUCTURE\n\nBefore we determine the transport properties for the\ndifferent forms of oxygen between aluminum electrodes\nwe will show the results for a pure Al atomic contact.\nThe transmission as a function of energy and the corresponding contact geometry are plotted in Fig. 3. The\nconductance of this contact is close to 1G0 and is carried\nby 3 channels, as expected.16,37,38,39 If oxygen sits between the two electrodes, the transmission changes significantly. The resulting T (E) curves for the contact geometries of Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 4. We note that whenever we speak about numbers of channels in this work, we\n\n\f5\n\n1.5\nTransmission\n\nT\nT1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nT2,3\nT4\n\n0\n\n-9\n\n-3\n-6\nEnergy E (eV)\n\nT5 T\n6\n0\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Al-Al: Transmission as a function of\nenergy.

The corresponding\ncontact geometry with a distance between the Al tip atoms\nof 3.4 \u00c5 is depicted to the right.\n\nmean channels that contribute at least 5% to the total\nconductance. This criterion approximately agrees with\nwhat can be resolved experimentally using superconducting electrodes.16\nP\nThe total transmissions T (E) =\nn Tn (E) and the\ntransmission eigenvalues Tn (E) of the individual channels\nof Al-O-Al [Fig. 1(a)] are plotted as a function of energy\nE in the left column of Fig. 4. The peaks labeled 1\u2013\n3 below the Fermi energy are due to oxygen. This can\nbe seen from the local density of states (LDOS) shown\nfor a tip-to-tip distance of 3.7 \u00c5 in Fig. 5 (Ref. 40) as\nwell as from the orbitals at the peaks shown in Fig. 6.\nPeak number 1 corresponds to the pz orbital of O (z is\nthe transport direction). Peaks 2 and 3 become almost\ndegenerate as soon as the O is on the contact axis. These\npeaks are due to the px and py orbitals of O. Peak 1\nis broader and shifted to lower energies than peaks 2\nand 3 due to the stronger binding of the pz orbital to\nthe Al states. The peaks above the Fermi energy are\ndue to aluminum. The number of channels contributing\nto the conductance is at least three. When the contact\nis opened, peaks 1\u20133 move, up to a tip-to-tip distance\nof 3.3 \u00c5, away from and afterwards towards the Fermi\nenergy. This behavior is caused by the length of the AlO bond.\nFor Al-O2 -Al [Fig. 1(b)], the total transmission and the\nchannel transmissions are shown in the central column of\nFig. 4. The peaks in T (E) are caused by the oxygen\nas can be seen from the LDOS in Fig. 5 for a tip-to-tip\ndistance of 4.5 \u00c5. Peaks number 4 and 5 originate from\nthe anti-bonding \u03c0 orbitals and peak 6 from the antibonding \u03c3 orbital (Fig. 6). The number of channels at\nthe Fermi energy is two for the intermediate tip-to-tip\ndistances between 4.6 \u00c5 and 4.9 \u00c5, but otherwise three.\nPeaks 4 and 5 shift upwards in energy without crossing\n\nthe Fermi energy while the contact is stretched. Peak 6\nmoves first away from and then, after a tip-to-tip distance\nof 4.5 \u00c5, towards the Fermi energy. The movement of this\npeak can be understood in terms of the behavior of the\ndistance between the O atoms, while the length of the\nAl-O bond is mainly responsible for the displacement of\npeaks 4 and 5.\nFor Al-O3 -Al [Fig. 1(c)], the transmissions are plotted\nin the right column of Fig. 4. The peaks shown have\ntheir origin in the ozone (Fig. 5 and 6). Peaks 8 and 9\nmove away from the Fermi energy with stretching up to\na tip-to-tip distance of 5.4 \u00c5 and approach afterwards\nthe Fermi energy. Peak 7 shifts continuously towards the\nFermi energy. The movement of peaks 8 and 9 again\nreflects the distances between the oxygen atoms, and the\nshift of peak 7 changes in the Al-O bond length. The\ncurrent is carried, up to a tip-to-tip distance of 5.4 \u00c5, by\nthree channels and afterwards by two channels.\nIn Fig. 7 the conductance is plotted as a function of the\ntip-to-tip distance for pure Al and for the three different\noxygen molecules in Al contacts. For pure Al contacts we\nobtain a conductance close to 1G0 with a positive slope\nshortly before rupture of the contact, in agreement with\nprevious investigations of Al atomic contacts.16,39,41,42\nIn the presence of oxygen, the conductances show the\nsame qualitative features for the three molecules (O, O2 ,\nand O3 ). The conductance first decreases with stretching up to a certain point. After this point it increases\nrapidly until the contact breaks and the conductance\ndrops. This trend can be understood by re-examining the\nevolution of the energy dependence of the transmission\nupon stretching (Fig. 4). Thus for instance, the increase\nof the conductance originates from the fact that the highest occupied molecular orbitals move close to the Fermi\nenergy. Quantitatively the conductance depends on the\nnumber of oxygen atoms in the molecule. The more oxygen atoms, the lower the conductance. In all cases, the\ntransport is influenced by a charge transfer from the Al\nto the oxygen molecule (around \u22120.6e for all the three\nmolecules, as determined by a Mulliken population analysis) leading to an occupation of molecular orbitals which\nwould be empty in an isolated oxygen molecule. Therefore, current is carried by formerly unoccupied p orbitals.\nWe also investigate the conductance in the tunneling\nregime. With this term we refer to the region of large\ntip-to-tip distances d, where the conductance exhibits an\nexponential decay G(d)/G0 \u221d e\u2212\u03b2d with an inverse decay\nlength \u03b2. In experiments there might be any number of\nO molecules covering the surfaces of the Al pyramids, but\nwe calculate representatively the tunneling conductance\nof Al-O2 -Al (not shown in Fig. 7), where the O atoms\nsit separated on both pyramids [see the rightmost part of\nFig. 1(b)]. We compare this to the tunneling conductance\nof pure Al contacts (shown in Fig. 7). For pure Al, the\ninverse decay length turns out to be \u03b2 = 2.1 \u00c5\u22121 and for\nAl with an O atom on both pyramids \u03b2 = 2.3 \u00c5\u22121 . Thus\nthe decay of the conductance is somewhat faster when\noxygen is present.\n\n\f6\n\nAl-O-Al\n\nAl-O2-Al\n\nAl-O3-Al\n\n3.1 \u00c5\n\n3.9 \u00c5\n\n5.0 \u00c5\n\n3.7 \u00c5\n\n4.5 \u00c5\n\n5.6 \u00c5\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n7\n\n6\n5\n\n8\n\n9\n\nTransmission\n\n0.5\n0\n1 4.3 \u00c5\n\n6.0 \u00c5\n\n0.5\n5.1 \u00c5\n0\n1\n4.5 \u00c5\n\nT\nT1\nT2\n\n0.5\n0\n\nT3\nT4\nT5\n5.3 \u00c5\n\n-9\n\n-6\n\n-3\n\n0 -9 -6 -3\n0 -9\nEnergy E (eV)\n\n6.2 \u00c5\n-6\n\n-3\n\n0\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Al-Ox -Al: Transmission as a function of energy for the structures shown in Fig. 1. The tip-to-tip\ndistance increases from the top to the bottom and is given in the panels. The vertical dashed lines indicate the Fermi\nenergy.\n\nPhysically, the value of \u03b2 is determined by the shape\nof the potential barrier between the tips, especially its\napparent height with respect to EF (Ref. 43). The barrier depends sensitively on the electronic structure of the\njunction, including the charge-transfer effects between\nthe different atoms close to the tips. In terms of the\nlocal-basis picture, all this information is contained in\nthe spectral functions of the tips and the hopping matrix\nelements connecting them. The mathematical details of\nthis interpretation are discussed further in App. A. In\nthis picture, an important role is played by the radial\n\ndecay properties of the orbitals of the tip atoms that are\nrelevant for transport. Roughly speaking, for O these\norbitals are the 2p ones, while for Al they are of the 3s\nand 3p type. The former orbitals decay faster and thus\nit is reasonable that inverse decay length \u03b2 is larger in\nthe presence of oxygen. Although the oxygen-induced\nchange in \u03b2 in this particular example is not very large,\nwe suggest that, in general, changes in the decay rate\nof the tunneling conductance may provide another possibility to check experimentally whether gas molecules are\npresent in the atomic contact or not.\n\n\f7\n\nLDOS (1/eV)\n\nAl-O-Al\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n-9\n\n-6\n\n-3\n\nAl-O2-Al\n\n0\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\nAl-O3-Al\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n-9 -6 -3 0\nEnergy E (eV)\n\n0\n\n-9\n\n-6\n\n-3\n\n0\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Al-Ox -Al: LDOS corresponding to the second row in Fig. 4.

In particular, the charge transport characteristics do not change significantly when the size of\nthe pyramids in the contact geometries is increased, nor\ndo they depend sensitively on the partitioning into the L,\nC, and R regions. We illustrate this fact in Fig. 8, where\nwe compare the transmission functions T (E) of the AlO2 -Al contact of Fig. 1(b) at a tip-to-tip distance of 4.5\n\u00c5. We vary the numbers of layers in the Al pyramids\nand divide the system differently into the three regions.\nClearly, the essential features of the results remain unaffected by these modifications. Such a robustness is observed as long as the assumption about vanishing matrix\nelements between the L and R regions is fulfilled, and\nthere are enough layers (at least two in the case of Al)\nleft in the L and R parts of the pyramids for coupling\nthe C part to the surfaces.\n\nIn order to investigate structures where the effect of\nO molecules on the transport properties is at its largest,\nwe have placed the oxygen molecules initially between\nthe pyramids and kept the Al electrodes fixed in the\ngeometry-optimization process. On the other hand, we\nknow that relaxing parts of the pyramids together with\nthe molecule can lead to geometrical structures differing\nconsiderably from the ideal contacts shown in Fig. 1. An\nexample of such a geometry is depicted in Fig. 9. Moreover, the formed structures depend on the initial placements of the atoms close to the tips and on the number of oxygen molecules present. Different realizations\nof atomic configurations can also be observed in experiments, where various kinds of I-V characteristics have\nbeen measured.44 However, as the transmission function\nin Fig. 9 shows, even more complex geometries can exhibit results whose main features resemble those of the\nsimplified structures discussed above. The transmission\nfunction shown in this figure should be compared with\nthe ones for the Al-O-Al contact in Fig. 4.

The vertical\ndashed line indicates the Fermi energy.\n\nlar, similarly to those results, there are three peaks (1-3)\nbelow the Fermi energy and the conductance is around\n0.2G0 .\nA similar approach to investigate oxygen in Al junctions was chosen by Jel\u0131\u0301nek et al. (Ref. 42). Those authors found structures where an oxygen atom is incorporated into the electrodes and their electrodes are con-\n\nnected by an aluminum dimer in the final stage before\nthe contact breaks. The conductance in their structures, therefore, is dominated by the aluminum dimer\nand the influence of the oxygen atom on the conductance is weak. We nevertheless believe that structures\nwith oxygen molecules bridging the gap between Al electrodes can be found in experiments. A situation corresponding to our simulations would most likely arise when\nthe oxygen is introduced into open contacts that are subsequently closed and then reopened. The experimental\nresults can then be compared to our predictions.\nIn conclusion, we studied the charge transport properties of aluminum atomic contacts in the presence of\noxygen molecules (O, O2 , and O3 ). We obtained stable\ngeometrical structures for the molecules in the junctions,\nand determined the molecules' vibrational modes in the\npresence of the aluminum electrodes. In principle these\nmodes should be measurable with the methods of point\ncontact spectroscopy. Moreover, we analyzed the evolution of the conductance for the Al-O/O2 /O3 -Al contacts in stretching processes, mimicking a conductance\ncurve measured in experiments while opening a break\njunction. These results show a typical behavior for all\nthe different molecules studied. First the conductance\ndecreases, until it starts to increase shortly before the\ncontact breaks. The value of the conductance was found\nto decrease with the number of oxygen atoms. Our observations can be understood by the interplay between\nmechanical and electronic properties. Changes in the\ndistances between the atoms result in modifications of\nthe electronic structure. The shifts in energy positions\nof individual molecular orbitals and their corresponding\npeaks in the transmission function can in turn explain the\nbehavior of the conductance in the stretching processes.\nFinally, we studied the decay lengths of the conductance\nin the tunneling regime, and found the decay to be faster\n\n\f9\nin the presence of oxygen than for pure aluminum contacts. This effect may provide a way for detecting gas\nmolecules in metallic atomic contacts.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Michael H\u00e4fner, Marcelo\nGoffman, and Antoine Isambert for sharing their ideas\nwith us.\nWe also thank the Theoretical Chemistry group of Reinhart Ahlrichs for helpful discussions\nand for providing us with Turbomole.

(2).\nFor a better understanding of the tunneling regime, it\nis nevertheless useful to cast Eq. (2) into another wellknown form. Let us assume that the C part of the system\ncan be divided into two regions 1 and 2, where region\n1 (2) is not coupled to the R (L) lead through direct\nhoppings or overlaps. Furthermore, regions 1 and 2 are\nconnected to each other by t12 = H 12 \u2212 ES 12 . Equation\n(2) can then be written in the form\nG = G0 Tr[Gr12 (\u0393R )22 Ga21 (\u0393L )11 ],\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere Ga21 = (Gr12 )\u2020 , and all energy-dependent quantities are evaluated at EF . Let us denote by g r11 and\ng r22 the Green's functions for the regions 1 and 2 in the\nabsence of t12 . For example g r11 (E) = [ES 11 \u2212 H 11 \u2212\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nPresent address: School of Chemistry, The University of\nSydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia\nJ.

We also define the unperturbed spectral density matrix A11 = i(g r11 \u2212 ga11 ), where g a11 = (g r11 )\u2020 , with\na similar definition for A22 . We note that H 11 and H 22\nare simply cut out from the full, self-consistent H CC and\nthus still contain indirect effects of t12 .\nThe full propagator between 1 and 2 is given by the\nDyson equation45 Gr12 = g r11 t12 Gr22 = g r11 T 12 g r22 . In\nthe last stage, we defined the t matrix T 12 due to the\nperturbation t12 (Ref. 46). Inserting these into Eq.\n(A1) and using the identities g r11 (\u0393L )11 g a11 = A11 and\ng r22 (\u0393R )22 g a22 = A22 , we find the following formula47\nG = G0 Tr[T 12 A22 T 21 A11 ].\n\n(A2)\n\nFar in the tunneling regime, the quantities t12 are small,\nsuch that the lowest-order approximation T 12 = t12\nshould be valid. Furthermore, to lowest order, the electronic structures of the tips (as represented by H 11 and\nH 22 , and hence A11 and A22 ) also become independent\nof the tip-to-tip distance.\nThe decay rate of the conductance with increasing distance between the tips (\u03b2) is now seen to be determined\nby two factors. The first is due to the decay of the couplings t12 . If one uses the Wolfsberg-Helmholz (or \"extended H\u00fcckel\") approximation, then H 12 and hence t12\nare related in a simple way to the overlap S 12 (Ref. 48).\nThis emphasizes that the major effect to the decay of\nt12 is simply due to the associated local basis functions,\nwhich decay with varying rates. The second factor is\ndue to the spectral functions A11 and A22 . They weight\nthe various components of t12 differently, and thus finally determine the decay rate \u03b2. The physical quantity\ncontrolling this rate is still the effective tunneling barrier, in particular its height with respect to EF , because\nthe latter determines the barrier-penetration lengths of\nthe electronic eigenstates of the tips. This information\nis contained in the matrices A11 and A22 in the form of\nthe weights of the different local basis functions of the\ntip atoms.\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n\nK. S.
