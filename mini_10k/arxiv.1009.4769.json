At around a redshift of 1000 the temperature\nof the universe drops to a level at which the Compton scattering is no longer efficient, effectively\nstalling the sound waves at the epoch of recombination. The distance these sound waves could\ntravel in the time between the formation of the perturbations and the epoch of recombination\nimprinted a characteristic scale into the spectrum of density perturbations. Because the universe\nhas a significant fraction of baryons, theory predicts that this characteristic scale will also be\nimprinted in the late-time spectrum of density perturbations. Since galaxies are expected to\nform in the regions that are overdense in baryons and dark matter, and because this is driven\nby where the initial perturbations were, there should be an small excess of galaxies at this\ncharacteristic scale away from other galaxies. At recombination this scale is roughly 150 Mpc,\nand it appears in the power spectrum of density fluctuations as a damped harmonic sequence, a\nseries of wiggles, which are what is known as the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO).The position\nof these wiggles measured as a function of redshift reveals information about dark energy.\nIt has been shown1,2 that it is possible to measure BAO using a photometric redshift survey.\nThe advantage of using photometric redshifts over spectroscopic redshifts is that they are much\nless expensive (time consuming) to obtain and so a much larger volume of the universe can be\n\n\f\u22122\n\n0.07\n\n10\n\n6\n\n0.06\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n\n0.05\n\n4\n3\n\n0.04\n\u03c3z\n\n\u03c6(M)\n\nrelative flux\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n0.03\n\n2\n\n0.02\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\nAll\nEarly\nLate\nStarburst\n\n1\n0\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22127\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n10\nwavelength (m)\n\n10\n\u221224\n\n\u221222\n\u221220\n\u221218\n\u221216\nabsolute magnitude (B band)\n\n0.01\n0\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nzc\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFigure 1: LHS : Interpolated SED library, all normalised to the same value at 0.4\u03bcm; Center : GOODS typespecific luminosity functions at 0.75 < z < 1; RHS : Fitted standard deviation of photometric redshift errors in\neach redshift slice of the simulation.\n\nsurveyed. Since the BAO feature is observed on fairly large scales, a volume even larger than\nthis must be surveyed in order to obtain a measurement with enough statistical significance\nto measure the cosmological parameters precisely. The disadvantage of photometric redshifts\nis that they have large errors and the exact distribution of these errors is currently not well\nunderstood. Here we present an early result from our simulations of the performance of LSST,\na future photometric wide-field survey, in measuring the BAO signal.\n2\n\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be the first of a next generation of ground\nbased optical telescopes. It seeks to investigate important scientific problems of the next decade:\nprobing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the\ntransient optical sky, and understanding galaxy formation and the structure of the Milky Way.\nAll these diverse science goals require wide-field repeated deep imaging of the sky in many optical\nbands.\nLSST will carry out such a survey by imaging 20,000 deg2 of the sky in six broad photometric\nbands ugrizy, imaging each region of sky roughly 2000 times (1000 pairs of back-to-back 15-sec\nexposures) over a ten-year survey lifetime. After 10 years, with 1000 visits (2x15s exposures),\nit is anticipated LSST will yield a coadded map of the sky with a 5-\u03c3 depth for point sources of\nr \u223c 27.5. For more details on the science goals and capabilities that will be provided by LSST,\nsee the LSST Science Book3 .\n3\n\nSimulation of mock galaxy catalogs\n\nWe take a model linear theory matter power spectrum and generate Gaussian realisations of\nover-densities. Each over-density is assigned Ni galaxies where Ni depends on the value of\nthe over-density and the expected mean number density of galaxies at the relevant redshift.\nThe mean number density of galaxies as a function of redshift is calculated by integrating the\nGOODS luminosity functions (LFs)4 , shown in the center panel of Fig. 1.\nEach galaxy in the simulation is assigned an absolute magnitude and a broad spectral type:\nearly-type, late-type or starburst. This is done by creating a probability distribution using the\ngalaxy-type specific LFs measured from GOODS4 , again see the center panel of Fig. 1. We then\ncreate a library of spectral energy densities (SEDs) of different galaxy types by interpolating\nthe CWW5 and Kinney6 empirical galaxy templates, which cover the range of galaxy types from\nearly to starburst, shown in the left-hand panel of Fig. 1. We randomly assign each galaxy an\nSED with a prior based on its original broad spectral type. Using the information simulated\nso far for each galaxy (specifically: z, absolute magnitude and SED) we calculate the observed\n\n\f4\n\nP(k)\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\nk (Mpc\u22121)\n\nFigure 2: Power spectrum measured from the simulation described in Sections 3 and 4.\n\napparent magnitudes in each LSST filter including the expected photometric and systematic\nerrors3 . We verify the simulation method by comparing our own simulation of the GOODS data\nto the real GOODS data.\nPhotometric redshifts are reconstructed using a \u03c72 fitting technique using the galaxy luminosity function as a prior. Our code produces reasonable distributions of the photometric\nredshift errors: zphot \u2212 zspec . The right-hand panel of Fig. 1 shows the fitted standard deviation\nof zphot \u2212 zspec in different redshift slices of \u2206z = 0.05 in the simulation. The precision after\nz = 1 worsens as expected due to the Balmer break having transitioned out of the y band and\nthe Lyman break having yet to enter the u band.\n4\n\nEarly simulation result\n\nWe have simulated just a small survey at this stage: 5 Gpc3 covering 0.7 < z < 1.4 and assuming\n100 visits of the simulated survey area.\nWe compute the power spectrum using a direct Fourier transform method as outlined in\nBlake et al. (2007)2 . To measure the precision on the BAO scale we use the \"wiggles only\" 7\nmethod: dividing the measured power spectrum by a smooth reference power spectrum given\nby the Eisenstein and Hu8 \"no-wiggles\" fitting formula. The \"wiggles only\" power spectrum is\nthen well approximated by a decaying sinusoid:\nk\nP (k)\n= 1 + Ak exp \u2212\nPref\n0.1hMpc\u22121\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u03b3 \u0015\n\n2\u03c0k\nsin\nka\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ka represents the acoustic scale.\nWe find the precision on the measurement of the acoustic scale from this simulation to be\n3%, corresponding to an error on the dark energy equation of state w (assumed constant) of\n16%. Performing a simple extrapolation to an equivalent simulation covering the LSST volume\nsuggests the precision of the acoustic scale measurement for LSST from BAO would be 0.4%,\ncorresponding to an error on w of about 2%.\n5\n\nLSST vs BigBOSS\n\nBigBOSS9 is a proposed spectroscopic survey to measure BAO. Though it will have more precise\nredshifts than LSST it will cover less volume and observe less galaxies, see Table 1. It is\ninteresting to compare the expected errors on the power spectrum for idealised versions of both\nsurveys.\nAn analytic expression for the expected fractional errors on the power spectrum under some\nsimplifying assumptions is given below:\n\u03c3P\n=\nP\n\ns\n\n2(2\u03c0)3\n1\nV 4\u03c0k2 dk\n\n\u0012\n\nP + 1/n\nP\n\n\u0013\n\n1\nhexp (\u2212(kz \u03c3z )2 ik )\n\n(2)\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nBigBOSS\nLSST \u03c3 =0.01\n\nBigBOSS\nLSST \u03c3 =0.03\n\nz\n\nz\n\nLSST \u03c3 =0\n\nLSST \u03c3 =0\n\nz\n\nz\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03c3 /P(k)\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nP\n\n10\n\nP\n\n\u03c3 /P(k)\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\nk (Mpc/h)\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nk (Mpc/h)\n\nFigure 3: Expected power spectrum errors for BigBOSS and LSST as given by Eq. 2.

On the left-hand side optimistic photometric redshift errors for\nLSST are assumed (\u03c3z = 0.01), and on the right-hand side, conservative ones (\u03c3z = 0.03).\nThe blue dashed line is for LSST with zero photometric redshift errors. The figure shows\nthat BigBOSS becomes shot noise dominated around the BAO scale. To produce competitive\nconstraints with BigBOSS LSST must achieve a photometric redshift precision of \u03c3z = 0.01,\nthough LSST performs far superior to BigBOSS on large scales for both assumed error models.\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nFrom our current simulations we find that:\n\u2022 Our simulation produces a realistic observed galaxy catalog.\n\u2022 Computation of photometric redshifts produces expected error distribution.\n\u2022 Using our current small survey simulation we have shown that a direct 3D power spectrum\nestimation with photometric redshifts can produce a reasonable constraint on kBAO :\n\u2206ka /ka = 3%\n\u2022 LSST is competitive with BigBOSS even on the BAO scale, it is superior at large scales.\n\u2206ka /ka = 0.3% (BigBOSS/LSST optimistic)\n\u2206ka /ka = 0.6% (LSST conservative)\n\nReferences\n1.
