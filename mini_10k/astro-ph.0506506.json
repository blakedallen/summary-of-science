However, in non-Euclidean spacetime \"there is no a priori\nreason to expect that the surface area 4\u03c0 r 2 and hence the radial coordinate r , will increase\nmonotonically as one moves from the center of the star outward\" (Misner et al [19]). Below,\nit is shown that in typical dynamic models of gravitational collapse, the interior experiences\na local inflation, and r reaches a local minimum at a horizon. As a result, the interior does\ncontain a trapped surface and a singularity.3\n\n2.\n\nLOCAL INFLATION DURING GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE\n\nAssume matter in a collapsing star is spherically symmetric and non-rotating. Define\na particle horizon as follows. Suppose two initially collocated observers synchronize clocks,\nand let t be the proper time of the first observer, and \u03c4 the proper time on the second\nobserver's clock as read by the first observer (for instance through photons sent at regular\nintervals by the second observer to the first). Define the notional distance from the second to\nthe first observer to be t \u2212 \u03c4 . Then, if the first observer proceeds toward r = +\u221e , r = 2M is\na particle horizon from the first observer's perspective, in that the notional distance from the\n\n3\n\nSee Oppenheimer and Snyder [21], Penrose [22], Hawking and Penrose [11], and Hawking and Ellis [10].\n\n\f-3-\n\nsecond observer to the first increases without bound as the second observer approaches\nr = 2M .\n\nSuppose two observers are at r = kM for k > 2 and the second observer moves to\nr = 0 at non-relativistic speeds, sufficiently early in the collapse that time dilation is\n\nnegligible. Then, the notional distance from r = 0 to r = kM is initially kM . Notional\ndistance will be an analytically useful measure of causal separation during collapse, because\nit increases continuously up to the point at which a notionally infinite distance between the\nobservers prevents any communication from the first to the second.\nIn a two-dimensional diagram, let the vertical dimension represent the proper time \u03c4\nof the second observer at an inertial frame at rest at the origin. Let the other dimension be the\nnotional distance A from the origin measured along a null line from the origin.4 The diagram\nwill also mark off on the A coordinate the proper distance to a given Schwarzschild radial\ndistance r = kM , showing the correspondence between the coordinate system of the second\nobserver at the origin and the first observer at r = kM . On a null line from the origin with\ngiven \u03c4 coordinate, r depends on A , and can be written as a function r = r (\u03c4 , A ) .\nAt \u03c4 = 0 , suppose the time dilation effects are negligible, so A \u2248 r (0, A ) and dr d A \u2248 1 .\nFrom \u03c4 = 0 up to some time \u03c4 = N while these effects remain negligible, the curve\n\nr (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M will be vertical at r = 2M , and similarly for any r = kM . As the star collapses\nand time dilation intensifies, the notional distance from the origin to a given r will increase.\n\n4\n\nThis coordinate is somewhat similar to an outgoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate (Misner et al Box 31.2).\n\n\f-4-\n\nTherefore, the curve r (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M will bend to the right and dr d A decreases. Figure 1\nshows the diagram at this point.\n\nFigure 1. Curves r = kM notionally recede from the origin as collapse takes place.\n\n\u03c4 axis\n\nA axis\n\n8M\n6M\n\n\u03c4 =N\n4M\n2M\n\n\u03c4 =0\nAssume that the function r (\u03c4 , A ) has the following properties in the exterior, which\ncan be readily verified in a given model of collapse, such as a model with uniform density\nand zero pressure (Misner et al \u00a732.4). Broadly, these assumptions imply that as the star\ncollapses, r = 2M recedes smoothly to notional infinity by a finite time \u03c4 = E .\n\n\f-5-\n\nProperty 1. The function r (\u03c4 , A ) is strictly increasing in A , because the speed of light is\n\nalways positive.5\n\nProperty 2. After some time \u03c4 = N , the function r (\u03c4 , A ) is strictly increasing in \u03c4 . That is,\n\nthe process of collapse is monotonic after \u03c4 = N , and is nearly Newtonian beforehand.\n\nProperty 3. The function r (\u03c4 , A ) is continuous.\n\nProperty 4. A particle horizon emerges by a finite proper time \u03c4 , that is,\nE = inf{\u03c4 \u2200A : r (\u03c4 , A ) < 2 M } > N .\n\nProperties 1 and 4 imply \u2200A : r ( E , A ) < 2M , that is, the null line at E and the curve\nr (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M converge asymptotically.6 Furthermore, a point on the surface of the collapsing\nstar will intersect the curve r (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M at the moment that the curve and the null line\nintersect, which occurs at notional infinity. That is, the surface of the star does not intersect\nthe null line at \u03c4 = E and the curve r (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M , but converges asymptotically to it. The\n\n5\n\nSee however the next footnote.\n\n6\n\nThis assumes matter is continuous rather than discrete. With discrete rather continuous matter, there would be\na point in time at which the last particle of the collapsing star reaches r=2M. In that case, a modified Property 1\nwould call only for the function to be non-decreasing, and the null line at E would intersect the curve\nr (\u03c4 , A ) = 2 M at the point ( E , A 2 M ) and coincide for A \u2265 A 2 M . In the case, the analysis below would change\nlittle, as the null line and the curve would nearly be tangent, given the large number of particles required for a\ncollapsing star to form a black hole.\n\n\f-6-\n\nproperties above guarantee that a curve r (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M \u2212 \u03b5 intersects the particle horizon for A\narbitrarily large, if \u03b5 is sufficiently small.7\nFigure 2 shows the diagram with this additional information. The four properties\nabove imply that from the perspective of a point at the origin, the surface of the star at some\npoint must stop collapsing toward the origin and begin receding to notional infinity, because\nthe surface is converging asymptotically toward a curve r (\u03c4 , A ) = 2M which is receding to\nnotional infinity. Shatskiy [25] (Figure 4) conjectures a similar process in which the interior\nexpands as collapse proceeds.\nThe last \u03b5 (for \u03b5 sufficiently small) of the collapsing star's mass to pass through the\nparticle horizon emerges from the horizon at an arbitrarily large notional distance from the\norigin, implying that radii are diverging in the interior in a neighborhood of r = 2 M .\nTheorem 1.\n\nIn any model of gravitational collapse satisfying Properties 1-4, dr d A = 0\n\nand d 2 r d A 2 > 0 at the particle horizon.\nProof: The theorem follows immediately from Properties 1-4. QED.\n\n7\n\nThis argument is valid if matter is continuous rather than discrete, or if the mass of a single particle is very\nsmall in relation to the mass of the black hole. See footnote 6.\n\n\f-7-\n\nFigure 2.

Under the assumption of such a limiting curvature, Frolov et al\n[6][7] observe that black holes generate closed worlds. Easson and Brandenberger [4] note\nthat the generation of universes from black hole interiors would solve the horizon, flatness,\nand structure formation problems without requiring a long period of inflation and also\nresolve the information loss and other paradoxes. Preskill [24] also concludes that baby\nuniverses are the most satisfying resolution to the information loss paradox.\n\n\f-8-\n\nThe interior forms an expanding universe, in that particles traveling on diverging radii\nwould become increasingly distant from each other (Armend\u00e1riz-Pic\u00f3n [1]). The rate of\nexpansion (divergence) is determined exactly by the Einstein equation.\nHawking and Penrose [11] predict a singularity before the big bang, so at least one of\nthis theorem's assumptions does not hold in an expanding interior. In particular, there is no\ntime-reversed trapped surface; past-directed geodesics do not converge but cross the horizon\nat distinct points in spacetime.\n\n3.\n\nQUANTUM MECHANICS VS. GENERAL RELATIVITY\n\nTo the extent that Theorem 1 applies generically, general relativity does not predict\nits own breakdown at singularities, and does not become inconsistent with quantum\nmechanics in the neighborhood of singularities. This section briefly revisits the two other\nprincipal points of tension between the two theories: the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and\nnon-locality.\n\n3.1.\n\nUncertainty Principle\n\nIt is possible to derive an uncertainty principle in general relativity as follows, which\nqualitatively resembles the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.8 The relativistic gravitational\nwaves produced by a chaotic n-body system,9 with n equal to the number of massive particles\n8\n\n9\n\nCarati and Galgani's [3] review other quantum-like features arising in classical systems.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 [23] first observed that the (Newtonian) 3-body problem exhibits chaotic behavior. In the n-body\ncase see Miller [18], Lecar [15], Kandrup and Smith [12], and Goodman et al [8].\n\n\f-9-\n\nin the observable universe, would cause each body to follow a deterministic but chaotic\ntrajectory.10 To an observer not able to predict the chaotic gravitational waves impinging on a\ngiven particle, the particle's location and velocity would appear stochastic.11 A known\nexample of this behavior is the Brownian motion of black holes at a galactic center, due to nbody behavior (Laun and Merritt [14]).\nChaotic gravitational waves would impose a constraint on any measurement, by\njiggling any measurement equipment in an unpredictable way. An exact prediction in a\nchaotic system requires complete information about the system. However, the model for\nprediction is itself part of the chaotic system. The subset of the system used for prediction\nmust incorporate a complete model of the entire system. Furthermore, to make predictions\nabout events before they happen, the subsystem would need to prepare a forecast faster than\nthe entire system itself evolves. This is clearly unlikely, although we do not have a formal\nproof. Thus, unless a relativistic n-body system can model itself locally, any observer that is\npart of that system will be constrained by an uncertainty principle.\n3.2.\n\nNon-Locality\n\nIn light of the above, non-locality, such as violations of the Bell inequality, appears to\nbe a more fundamental point of tension between relativity and quantum mechanics. An nbody relativistic system is subject to the speed of light, and an observer capable of predicting\nthe system's behavior will not perceive any Bell violations except by coincidence or\n\n10\n\nStochastic gravitational background radiation is a focus of theoretical and empirical work, as reviewed in\nMaggiore [17].\n\n11\n\nLasota and Mackey [13] describe how chaotic systems can produce phenomena that appear stochastic.\n\n\f- 10 -\n\nconspiracy.12 Nonetheless, a better understanding of how chaotic gravitational waves interact\nwith the measurement equipment of an observer subject to the above uncertainty principle\nwould help delineate which quantum phenomena might have gravitational explanations.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n\n12\n\nC.
