To be more precise, after describing a protocol for secret key distillation from a state by one\u2013way\npublic discussion, we show how secrecy codes of a particular structure can be converted into one\u2013way LOCC\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: devetak@us.ibm.com\naddress: winter@cs.bris.ac.uk\n\nentanglement distillation protocols achieving the coherent information, as was conjectured for some time under\nthe name of the \"hashing inequality\" (after the hashing protocol in [6] which attains the bound for Bell\u2013\ndiagonal two\u2013qubit states). It is well\u2013known from [33]\nthat this inequality yields information theoretic characterisations of distillable entanglement under general\nLOCC, as well as the quantum transmission capacity,\nwithout, with forward and with bidirectional classical\nside channel (the first of these capacity theorems proved\nrecently by Shor [48], following a heuristic argument of\nLloyd [37], and subseqently in [19]). Our approach is\nvery close to that of [19], and - as far as secret key distillation is concerned - the work [11]: while here our resource is a three\u2013party quantum state (\"static\" model),\nthese papers deal with the \"dynamic\" analogue, where\nthe resource is a quantum/wiretap channel.\nAs for the structure of the paper: the main result of the\ncryptographic part is theorem 1 in section II; the form of\nthe optimal rates is then not hard to obtain, as we shall\nshow in the detailed discussion. It is theorem 1 which\nwe return to in the entanglement distillation part: a very\ngeneral modification of the coding procedure will give us\ntheorem 10, the hashing inequality; and as before, the\nform of the optimal rates is not hard to get from there.\nA reader only interested in entanglement distillation can\nthus skip the second part of section II: there the general\nform of optimal one\u2013way distillable secret key is derived.\nIn section III we turn to one\u2013way entanglement distillation, proving the hashing inequality and exhibiting the\ngeneral form of optimal one\u2013way distillation; then in section IV the consequences of the hashing inequality are\ndetailed. Appendices collect the necessary facts about\ntypical subspaces (A), some miscellaneous lemmas (B)\nand miscellaneous proofs (C).\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nONE\u2013WAY SECRET KEY DISTILLATION\n\nWe will first study and solve the case of cqq\u2013\ncorrelations, i.e., the initial state \u03c1ABE has the form\nX\n\u03c1ABE =\nP (x)|xihx|A \u2297 \u03c1BE\n(1)\nx .\nx\u2208X\n\nI(A : B) = H(A) + H(B) \u2212 H(AB),\n\nThen n copies of that state can be written\n\u0001\u2297n X n n n n A\n\u03c1ABE\n=\nP (x )|x ihx | \u2297 \u03c1BE\nxn ,\n\nwhich for the cq\u2013state of eq. (1) is easily checked to be\nequal to\nX\nH(\u03c1B ) \u2212\nP (x)H(\u03c1B\nx ),\n\nxn\n\nwith xn = x1 . . . xn and\n\nx\n\n|xn i = |x1 i \u2297 * * * \u2297 |xn i,\n\nBE\nBE\n\u03c1BE\nx n = \u03c1x 1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1x n .\n\nLet X be a random variable with distribition P , and\ncorresponding to the n copies of \u03c1 consider independent\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) realisations X1 , . . . , Xn of\nX.\nA one\u2013way key distillation protocol consists of:\n\u2022 A channel T : xn \u2212\u2192 (l, m), with range l \u2208\n{1, . . . , L} and m \u2208 {1, . . . , M }.\n(l)\n\nn\n\u2022 A POVM D(l) = (Dm )M\nm=1 on B for every l.\n\nThe idea is that Alice generates T (X n ) = (\u039b, K); her\nversion of the key is K = m, while she sends \u039b = l to\nBob. He obtains his K \u2032 by measuring his system B using\nD(l) :\n\u0001\n(l) B\nPr{K \u2032 = m|\u039b = l, X n = xn } = Tr Dm\n\u03c1x n .\n\nFor technical reasons we assume that the communication\nhas a rate L \u2264 2nF , for some constant F .\nWe call this an (n, \u01eb)\u2013protocol if\n\u2032\n\n1. Pr{K 6= K } \u2264 \u01eb.\n2. Dist(K) \u2212\n\n1\nM 1{1,...,M} 1\n\n3. There is a state \u03c30 such that for all m,\n\nxn ,l\n\na quantity known as the Holevo bound [29] and which we\ndenote I(P ; \u03c1B ), reflecting in the notation the distribution P and the cq\u2013channel with channel states \u03c1B\nx . We\nshall often use the abbreviation I(X; B) for this latter,\nif the states and distribution of the random variable X\nare implicitly clear: this latter notation has the advantage that for any U jointly distributed with X, I(U ; B)\nmakes sense immediately, without our having to write\ndown a composite state.\nFinally, for a tripartite state \u03c1ABC , define the (quantum) conditional mutual information\nI(A : C|B) := H(AB) + H(BC) \u2212 H(ABC) \u2212 H(B),\nwhich is non\u2013negative by strong subadditivity [36]. Usually the state these notations refer too will be clear from\nthe context; where not we add it in subscript. Observe\nthat for a classically correlated system B, the conditional\nmutual information takes the form of a probability average over mutual informations: e.g., for the state of eq. (1),\nX\nI(B : E|A) =\nP (x)I(B : E)\u03c1x .\nx\n\nAlso for conditional mutual information we make use of\nthe hybrid notation involving random variables: for example, for random variables T and U , jointly distributed\nwith X, I(U ; B|T ) is the average over T of Holevo quantities as above.\n\n\u2264 \u01eb.\n\nX\nPr{X n = xn, \u039b = l|K = m}|lihl| \u2297 \u03c1E\nxn \u2212 \u03c30\n\n\u2212Tr\u03c1 log \u03c1, and the Shannon\nP entropy of a probability distribution P , H(P ) = \u2212 x P (x) log P (x). If the state is\nthe reduced state of a multi\u2013party state, like the \u03c1ABE\nabove, we write H(A) = H(\u03c1A ), etc. In the particular\ncase of eq. (1), obviously H(\u03c1A ) = H(P ). For a general\nbipartite state \u03c1AB define the (quantum) mutual information\n\n\u2264 \u01eb.\n1\n\nWe call R an achievable rate if for all n there exist\n(n, \u01eb)\u2013protocols with \u01eb \u2192 0 and n1 log M \u2192 R as n \u2192 \u221e.\n(The convention in this paper is that log and exp are\nunderstood to be to basis 2.) Finally define\nK\u2192 (\u03c1) := sup{R : R achievable},\nthe one\u2013way (or forward) secret key capacity of \u03c1.\nBefore we can formulate our first main result, we have\nto introduce some information notation: for a quantum\nstate \u03c1 we denote the von Neumann entropy H(\u03c1) =\n\nTheorem 1 For every cqq\u2013state \u03c1,\nK\u2192 (\u03c1) \u2265 I(X; B) \u2212 I(X; E).\nProof. The idea is as follows: the state\nX\nA\n\u03c1AB =\nP (x)|xihx| \u2297 \u03c1B\nx\nx\n\ncontains the description of a cq\u2013channel with channel\nstates \u03c1x . We will cover \"evenly\" all typical type classes\nof block length n by channel codes Cl to transmit \u2248\nnI(X; B) bits, most of which are \"good\" in the sense\nthat they have small error probability. All of them are\nof the kind that the state of E, when taking the average\n\n\f3\nover the last \u2248 nI(X; E) bits of the input, is almost a\nconstant operator, \u03c3l , independent of the leading bits.\nThe key distillation scheme works then as follows: on\nobserving xn , which is typical with high probability, Alice\nannounces the type of it and a random l, such that xn is\na codeword of the code Cl , to Bob. He is able to decode\nit with high probability (because the code will be good\nwith high probability), and they take the leading\n\u2248 n(I(X; B) \u2212 I(X; E)) bits\nof the message as the key.

Our protocol in contrast\nhas two very distinct communication parts: there is the\n\"code information\" (which amounts to error correction\nbetween Alice and Bob, with built\u2013in privacy amplification for Eve's information about the basis state), and\nthere is the \"phase information\" from the measurement\nin the Fourier transformed basis. The first amounts to\nH(X) \u2212 I(X; \u03c8 B ) = H(p00 + p01 , p10 + p11 ),\nwhile the second is\nI(X; E) = H({p}) \u2212 H(p00 + p01 , p10 + p11 ).\n\nwhere \u03c9l =\n\nD(1) (\u03c1) := max\nT\n\nL\nX\nl=1\n\n\u03bbl Ic (A iB)\u03c1l ,\n\nwhere the maximisation is over quantum instruments\nT = (T1 , . . . , TL ) on Alice's system, \u03bbl = Tr Tl (\u03c1A ) and\n\u03c1l = \u03bb1l (Tl \u2297 id)(\u03c1). The range of l can be assumed to be\nbounded, L \u2264 d2A , and moreover each Tl can be assumed\nto have only one Kraus operator: Tl (\u03c3) = Al \u03c3A\u2020l .\nProof. First, for the direct part, it is sufficient to consider\nan instrument T on one copy of the state: if Alice performs the instrument T on each copy and communicates\nthe result to Bob, they end up with the new state\nX\nB\u2032\n\u03c1e =\n\u03bbl \u03c1AB\n\u2297 |lihl| .\nl\n\n\u2297 id)(\u03c1\u2297n ).

Then by the\nconvexity of Ic in the state [36],\n\u03bbl Ic (A iB)\u03c1l \u2264\n\nOur result leads to the general formula for one\u2013way\ndistillable entanglement:\nTheorem 13 For any bipartite state \u03c1AB ,\n\u0001\n1\nD\u2192 (\u03c1) = lim D(1) \u03c1\u2297n ,\nn\u2192\u221e n\nwith\n\n1\n\u03bbl (Tl\n\nX\nj\n\n\u03bblj Ic (A iB)\u03c1lj .\n\nBy the polar decomposition and invariance of Ic under\nlocal unitaries\nwe may further assume that Al \u2265 0, i.e.\nq\n\u2020\nAl = Al Al ; in this form the whole instrument is ac\u0001\ntually described by the POVM A2l l , and each POVM\ncorresponds to an instrument by taking as the Al the\nsquare roots of the POVM operators.\nNow, invoking a theorem of Davies [17] (which actually is another application of Caratheodory's theorem,\nlemma 20), any POVM is a convex combination of extremal POVMs, which have at most d2A non\u2013zero elements each, and this convex decomposition\nclearly carP\nries over to the instruments: T = j \u03c0j Tj . Since then\nP\nl \u03bbl Ic (A iB)\u03c1l is the same convex combination of similar such terms for the instruments\nTj , at least one of\nP\nthese gives a higher yield\n\u03bb\nI\n(A\niB)\u03c1l : note that\nl lj c\nthe cp\u2013maps of Tj are scalar multiples of the Tl , hence\nthe output state of Tj with classical result l is \u03c1l .\n\u2737\n\nl\n\nObserve that\n\nIc (A iBB \u2032 )\u03c1e =\n\nX\nl\n\n\u03bbl Ic (A iB)\u03c1l ,\n\nthus application of theorem 10 to \u03c1e gives achievability.\nFor the converse, consider any one\u2013way distillation\nprotocol with rate R, and denote Alice's instrument by\nT = (Tl )l , Bob's quantum operations by Rl .

Then,\nQ\u2205 (T ) = Q\u2192 (T ) = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nmax Ic (A\u2032 iB n )\u03c9 ,\nn |\u03c8i\n\nwith any pure state \u03c8 on A\u2032 An and the state\n\u2032\n\n\u03c9 = (id \u2297 T )\u2297n (\u03c8 A A ).\n\n\f10\nand we are done.\n\nFurthermore,\nQ\u2194 (T ) = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nsup Ic (A\u2032 iB n )\u03c9 ,\nn |\u03c8,V i\n\nwith any pure state \u03c8 on A\u2032 An , two\u2013way LOCC operation\nV and the state\nh\ni\n\u2032\n\u03c9 = V (id \u2297 T )\u2297n (\u03c8 A A ) .\n\nProof. See [33]. That forward communication does not\nhelp was proved in [5], and that the right hand side is an\nupper bound to Q\u2205 was shown in [37, 45].\nThe idea of achievability is to distill the state \u03c9 and\nthen use teleportation - this involves forward communication but either it is free or the whole procedure including the distillation and teleportation uses only forward\ncommunication, which by [5] can be removed.\nIn [33] a similar formula (involving a coherent information Ic (B iA)\u03c3 ) was proposed for the quantum capacity\nwith classical feedback. However, the proof as indicated\nabove does not work in this case: indeed we may use\nthe back\u2013communication to help distillation, but teleportation needs a forward communication, so we end up\nwith a quantum channel code utilising two\u2013way classical side communication, which is not known to be reducible to just back\u2013communication: in fact, the results\nof Bowen [9] might be taken as indication that for the\nerasure channel the capacities with feedback and with\ntwo\u2013way side communication are different.\n\u2737\nWe have already given a formula for the distillable entanglement using one\u2013way LOCC in theorem 13:\nTheorem 15 For any state \u03c1AB ,\n1\nsup Ic (A\u2032 iB \u2032 )\u03c9 ,\nn\u2192\u221e n V\n\nD(\u03c1) = lim\n\nwith any two\u2013way LOCC operation V and\u0001 the coherent\ninformation refers to the state \u03c9 = V \u03c1\u2297n .\n\nProof. For the direct part (\"\u2265\") it is obviously sufficient\nto consider any two\u2013way LOCC operation V on the bipartite system, which applied to \u03c1 gives a state \u03c3. Doing\nthat for n copies of \u03c1, application of theorem 10 shows\nthat we can distill EPR pairs at rate Ic (A\u2032 iB \u2032 )\u03c3 from\nthis.\nConversely, let V0 be a two\u2013way LOCC producing a\nstate \u03a9 with k\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a6M k1 \u2264 \u01eb, nR = log M . Without loss\nof generality we may assume that \u03a9 is supported within\nthe tensor product of the supports of the reduced states\nof \u03a6M .

Note\nthat the inequality is trivially true (using only concavity\nof the entropy) for the loss of coherent information on\nthe left hand side.\nHistory and relation to other work:\nThe coherent information made its appearance in [45]\nwhere its relation to quantum channel capacity was conjectured and many of its properties proved. Independently [37] proposed this quantity and a heuristic for a\nproof which however fell short of a proof. Only recently\nHamada [26] succeeded in giving a lower bound on quantum channel capacity in terms of coherent information\n- still with a crucial restriction to stabiliser codes. It\ntook until [48] for a full proof to be found - but then\nquite quickly one of us [19] discovered a proof based on\nprivate information transmission, an idea inspired by the\nwork of Schumacher and Westmoreland [47].\nRegarding entanglement distillation, the hashing inequality appears to have been a folk conjecture from the\npublication of [6] on, which however has received much\nless attention than the quantum channel coding problem.\nIt was codified as an important conjecture in [33].\nWhile completing the writing of the present paper we\nlearned of the work [34], in which it is shown that the\nproof by random coding of the channel capacity theorem\ncan be used to obtin the hashing inequality. It may be interesting to compare the proofs [34, 48] for the achievability of the coherent information to ours and [19]. While\nwe, on the face of it, take a detour via secret key distillation, the final procedure can be argued more direct: in\nparticular, we don't require the \"double blocking\" which\nin the other approaches seem necessary to reduce to a situation in which Alice's end is in a maximally mixed state.\nThus, presumably, our codes achieve rates approaching\nthe coherent information more quickly, i.e. for smaller\nblock length.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur findings not only transport an existing classical theory of distilling secret key from prior correlation\n(Maurer [39], Ahlswede and Csisz\u00e1r [2], and follow\u2013up\nwork) to the quantum case, but also link this subject to\n\n\f11\nentanglement distillation in an operational way: a coherent implementation of the basic secret key distillation protocol yielded an entanglement distillation protocol achieving the coherent information - this then implies information theoretic formulas for distillable entanglement and quantum capacities.\nWe want to draw the reader's attention to several open\nquestion that we have to leave: first of all, are there\nstates for which D\u2192 (\u03c1) < K\u2192 (\u03c1)? Are there maybe even\nbound entangled states with positive key rate? A first\nstep might be to find states such that D(1) (\u03c1) < K (1) (\u03c1).\nNote that the potential gap between K\u2192 and D\u2192 comes\nfrom the possibility to have more general measurements\nat Alice's side than the complete von Neumann measurement in the Schmidt basis that was our starting point\nin the proof of theorem 10 (actually any complete von\nNeumann measurement would do): namely, in key distillation, a viable option for Alice is to discard part of\nher state (corresponding to using higher rank POVM elements), but keep that part secret from Eve all the same;\nwhile in entanglement distillation, 'Eve\" is everything except Alice and Bob, so it is as if she would get the parts\nAlice decided to toss away.\nA second group of open questions: in general, the optimisations in theorems 6, 8 and 13 are quite nasty, most\nso because they involve a limit of many copies of the\nstate. In the classical theory of secret key distillation, a\nsingle\u2013letter formula for the optimal one\u2013way key rate is\nproved in [2], so there might be hope at least for theorem 6. In contrast, the optimal rate of two\u2013way protocols\nor even a procedure to decide if it is nonzero is still to be\nfound (see the very well\u2013informed reviews [31] and [32]),\nwhich is why we concentrate on one\u2013way protocols for\nnow. It is known that distillability of entanglement may\nbe absent for a single copy of a state, but could appear\nfor collective operations on several copies (see again the\nreview [32], sections 6.3 and 7.2 and references therein),\nso there are only limited possibilities for making theorem 13 into a single\u2013letter formula. Note in particular\nthat the results of [22] - see also the discussion of Barnum, Nielsen and Schumacher [45] where the failure of\nsubadditivity for the coherent information is observed -\nimply that single\u2013letter maximisation of the coherent information will certainly not achieve the optimum distillability. It would therefore be good to have at least an a\npriori bound on the number n of copies of the state which\nwe have to consider to have D(1) (\u03c1\u2297n ) within, say \u01eb, of\nthe optimal rate. In general, good single\u2013letter lower and\nupper bounds [13] are still wanted!\nFinally, we would like to know what the public/classical communication cost is of distilling secret key\nand entanglement, respectively, in particular in the one\u2013\nway scenario (which at any rate seems to be the one\nopen to analysis). More generally, if we limit the amount\nof communication, can we determine the optimal distillation rates (see [21] for the communication cost of\ncommon randomness distillation)? In the entanglement\ncase this should link up with initial efforts to understand\n\nthe communication cost of various state transformation\ntasks [4, 27, 28, 38]. A study concerning the forward\ncommunication cost of entanglement distillation is in perparation [20].\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank Patrick Hayden and Debbie Leung\nfor a discussion at the conception of this work.

In [46], it is proved that selecting\n\u0001\nN \u2032 = 2(n + 1)|X | exp n(I(P ; W ) \u2212 \u03b4)\n\ncodewords u(i) at random, i.i.d. according to P \u2297n , one\ncan construct a canonical decoding POVM such that for\nthe expectation (over the code CHSW ) of the average error\nprobability, pE , goes to zero:\n\u0001\nhpE iCHSW \u2264 9\u01eb + N \u2032 exp \u2212n(I(P ; W ) \u2212 \u03b4/2) . (C6)\n(See [46], eq. (34).) The first thing we note is that (for\nsufficiently large n) \u01eb = exp(\u2212\u03b3n) for a constant \u03b3 > 0\ndepending on \u03b4: this follows by inspection of section III\nof [46], where \u01eb is introduced as the loss of probability\nmass by removing non\u2013typical contributions. As non\u2013\ntypicality is defined as large deviation events for a sum\nof independent random variables, of the form\nX\nlog \u03bbxn =\nlog \u03bbxk ,\nk\n\nthe Chernoff bound allows us to put exponential bounds\non the non\u2013typical mass.\nHence eq. (C6) can be rewritten, for sufficiently large\nn,\nhpE iCHSW \u2264 exp(\u2212n\u03b2),\n\n(C7)\n\nwith some \u03b2 > 0.\nWe want to show that CHSW \u2229 TPn is a good approximation to a random code from the type class TPn . Of\ncourse, it is not quite that, if only because it has a variable number of codewords! There is an easy fix\n\u0001 to this\nproblem: define, with N = exp n(I(P ; W ) \u2212 \u03b4) ,\nC := First N elements of CHSW \u2229 TPn ,\n\nwhich makes sense because we can put the codewords in\nthe order we select them.
