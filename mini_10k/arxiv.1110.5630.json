In their most recent measurement the CDF collaboration found a dramatic\ndependence of the size of the asymmetry on the tt invariant mass Mtt . In particular, in the high invariant\nmass region, Mtt > 450 GeV, the parton level asymmetry in the tt rest frame was found to deviate from\nthe next to leading order (NLO) standard model (SM) prediction by 3.4\u03c3. However, in the low invariant\nmass region, Mtt < 450 GeV, the deviation reduced to only \u223c 1\u03c3. Although the D/0 collaboration does\nconfirm the possibility of an interesting deviation from the SM in the tt FBA they find no statistically\nsignificant enhancement of the asymmetry in the high invariant mass region.\nThese results have inspired many theoretical models to explain the anomaly, e.g., [5\u201328, 33\u201338]. One\nparticular class of models which has received a large amount of attention involves new particle content\nexchanged in the t-channel of the tt pair production process [16\u201319, 21\u201324, 26\u201328, 33\u201336]. The main\nsignature of these models is destructive interference with the SM QCD amplitudes stemming from large\ninter-generational couplings which connect the u and t quarks via some new mediator (scalar or vector).\nIn order to produce the desired interference effects the coupling must be chiral and, in the case of a vector\nmediator, is generally chosen to be right-handed in order to avoid strong constraints from electroweak\nprecision data and flavor physics. Considering the strong constraints on flavor changing neutral currents\n(FCNC) in the down quark sector this mediator should either only couple to up-type quarks or have flavor\ndiagonal couplings in the down quark sector. Even in the latter case, care must be taken as flavor diagonal\ncouplings to bb could potentially lead to undesirable deviations in precision electroweak observables.\nIt has been known for some time now that there exists tension between the inclusive and exclusive\ndeterminations of |Vub | [48\u201351]. Experimental determinations of |Vub | are based on the semi-leptonic decay\nrates of the B meson. The inclusive value of |Vub |, |Vub |incl , is extracted from measurements in which only\nthe final state lepton is detected, B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd. This measurement is made difficult by the large charmed\nbackground owing to the fact that |Vub | << |Vcb |. Due to this, a proper extraction of |Vub | requires one\nto either look directly for exclusive final states, in which case the extraction yields the exclusive value\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f|Vub |excl , or suppress the charmed background kinematically. The inclusive and exclusive results do not\nagree, with |Vub |incl = (4.25 \u00b1 0.15exp \u00b1 0.20th ) \u00d7 10\u22123 [52] and |Vub |excl = (3.25 \u00b1 0.12exp \u00b1 0.28th ) \u00d7 10\u22123\n[53] which differ by \u223c 25%. In the exclusive case, one needs knowledge of the relevant hadronic matrix\nelements while, in the inclusive case, there can be difficulties in terms of understanding the effect of the\nnecessary kinematic cuts on the perturbative expansion. In both cases there can be a large amount of\nuncertainty involved. The branching ratio for B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd is also a useful observable in the study of the\ndifferent determinations of |Vub |. In the SM the branching ratio is given by\nG2 mB m2\u03c4\nBr(B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) = F\n8\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nm2\n1 \u2212 2\u03c4\nmB\n\n\u00132\n\nfB2 |Vub |2 \u03c4B\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere the Fermi constant GF , the B meson and \u03c4 lepton masses, and the \u03c4 lifetime have all been precisely\nmeasured [49] leaving only the decay constant fB and |Vub |. If the lattice determination of the decay\nconstant, fB = 208 \u00b1 8 MeV [55], is taken as reliable then the branching ratio is essentially a function\nof |Vub | only. The branching ratio is within 1\u03c3 of the experimental value for |Vub |incl while it deviates by\n\u223c3\u03c3 for |Vub |excl [54]. Although this deviation can be caused by some combination of the above mentioned\nuncertainties we consider the case in which it is caused by the effects of so-far unknown new physics (NP).\nConsidering the proximity of the prediction of Br(B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) to the experimental value using |Vub |incl , this\nseems to imply that the NP should enter distinctively into the exclusive decays.\nRecently it has been realized that anomalous right-handed charge currents (RHCC) in the quark sector\ncan alleviate the tension between the different determinations of |Vub | while simultaneously improving\nagreement between the prediction and experimental value of Br(B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) [56\u201358]. Most recently, the\nauthors of [58] considered an effective RHCC and corresponding mixing matrix, V R , generated by an\nenlargement of the gauge symmetry. The interference effects of the right-handed mixing matrix V R with\nthe standard left-handed mixing matrix, denoted as V L , were suppressed in the inclusive decays B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd\nbut not in the exclusive decay B \u2192 \u03c0`\u03bd, implying that the NP dominantly affects the exclusive decay\nL and V R using the experimental constraints from the semichannels. A global fit to the elements Vub\nub\nleptonic inclusive decay B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd, the semi-leptonic exclusive decay B \u2192 \u03c0`\u03bd, and the purely leptonic\nL | = (4.1 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22123 and Re(V R /V L ) = \u22120.19 \u00b1 0.07.\ndecay B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd determined the best fit values |Vub\nub\nub\nFor comparison, the most recent inclusive measurement of |Vub | is |Vub |incl = (4.25\u00b10.15exp \u00b10.20th )\u00d710\u22123\n[52].\nIn the standard model the tree level W boson couplings to fermions are strictly left-handed by construction. However, small effective RHCC\nthough quantum loop effects. The relative\n\u0012 are generated\n\u0013\n\u03b1g mf mf 0\nstrength of such currents in the SM is O\nwhere mf , mf 0 , and MW are the masses of the\n2\n4\u03c0 MW\nfermions and the W boson respectively and \u03b1g is the relevant coupling. Even for RHCC involving the top\nquark the largest correction is due to QCD and the effect is expected to be less than 1%. Many NP models\ncan induce sizeable tree level right-handed currents by enlarging the gauge symmetry [40\u201347]. However,\nsevere constraints from the active neutrino sector generally force the scale of these models to inaccessibly\nhigh energies. An alternative route is to generate RHCC via loop effects involving new beyond SM particle\ncontent. This method has the added benefit that, as long as the active neutrinos are left-handed and the\nright-handed sterile neutrinos are sufficiently heavy, no leptonic right-handed currents can be generated;\nthereby relegating all NP effects to the quark sector and avoiding the stringent constraints associated with\nthe leptonic sector.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fIn the current work we explore the role of the abnormal flavor structure hinted at by the top quark\nFBA in enhancing the strength of anomalous loop-induced RHCC contributing to B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays and\ntherefore ameliorating the tension in the different determinations of |Vub |. The same flavor couplings which\nenhance RHCC in B decays also have the potential to generate large loop-induced RHCC in top decays\nwhich are subject to strong indirect constraints from rare B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 decays. Despite this, we will show\nthat RHCC generated by the virtual exchange of a new scalar (vector) in top decays are CKM (as well\nas chiral) suppressed while in B decays the RHCC are CKM (and chiral) enhanced thereby allowing us\nto choose large couplings to alleviate the |Vub | tension and remain unconstrained by the strong indirect\nB \u2192 Xs \u03b3 constraints.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows: in section II we describe the effective formalism used, briefly\nreview the relevant indirect constraints from B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, and discuss the necessary bounds on the righthanded mixing matrix to alleviate the |Vub | tension. In section III we examine the case of a leptophobic\nZ 0 which mediates the flavor changing coupling, while in section IV we examine the possibility that the\nflavor couplings are associated with a scalar mediator. In section V we discuss how flavor off-diagonal\nelements of squark mass matrices in the context of the MSSM and a recently proposed supersymmetric\nexplanation of the top quark FBA can also generate the RHCC and in section VI we conclude.\n\n2\n\nFormalism\n\nIn the language of effective field theory, the effects of any anomalous loop-induced chiral charge currents\nare felt strictly through the presence of gauge invariant dimension six operators of the type\ncR\nij\nuRi \u03b3 \u03bc dRj H\u0303 \u03b1\u2020 (iD\u03bc H)\u03b1 + h.c.\n\u039b2\ncL\n\u0001\n1ij \u03b1\n/ \u03b1 Qj\u03b2L\n= 2 QLi H \u03b2\u2020 iDH\n\u039b\ncL\n2ij \u03b1\n+ 2 QiL \u03b3 \u03bc (\u03c4 a )\u03b1\u03b2 Qj\u03b2L H \u03b3\u2020 (\u03c4 a )\u03b3 \u03b4 (iD\u03bc H)\u03b4 + h.c.\n\u039b\n\nR\ncR\nij Oij =\nL\ncL\nij Oij\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere uR , dR , and QL are the SU (2)L singlet right-handed up and down type quarks and the left-handed\nSU (2)L quark doublets respectively. Flavor indices are denoted as i, j while the fundamental and adjoint\nSU (2)L indices are denoted as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 and a respectively. The SM Higgs doublet is H while H\u0303 = i\u03c32 H \u2217\nand the scale of the NP that gives rise to these new operators is denoted by \u039b.

The SM charged current is reproduced by setting cL\n1ij = c2ij = cij = 0.\nThe effects of RHCC in top decay have been investigated in terms of their effects on observables\nwhich are sensitive to the tbW \u2212 vertex structure. In particular, the branching ratio of the rare B \u2192 Xs \u03b3\ndecays strongly, although indirectly, constrain any alterations to this structure. The constraints on VtbR are\nparticularly tight due to an enhancement by a factor mt /mb [64]. A relatively recent study has determined\nthat these constraints imply the 95% C.L. upper and lower bounds \u22120.0007 \u2264 VtbR \u2264 0.0025 [65, 66] as\nlong as one assumes no other anomalous couplings. If one drops these assumptions the possibility of\ncancellations which could loosen the constraints arise. We will assume that these bounds are robust and\nthat their implications should be taken seriously.\nIn [58], bounds on both the left and right-handed mixing matrices were determined by comparison\nwith SM processes in s \u2192 u, b \u2192 c, and b \u2192 u transitions. The results of the fits to the left-handed\nmixing matrix are\nL\n|Vus\n| = 0.2248 \u00b1 0.0009\n\n|VcbL | = (40.7 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\nL\n|Vub\n| = (4.1 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe assume a Wolfenstein parametrization of the left-handed mixing matrix such that the first two\nequations in Eq. 2.5 uniquely determine the parameters \u03bb and A. In order to determine the rest of the\nWolfenstein parameters we note that a large CP-violating phase in Bs mixing, as hinted at by recent\nTevatron experiments, can be accommodated partly by assuming that |VtdR | \u223c 0 [58]. In this limit, we\ncan attribute the measured value |Vtdexp | = (8.4 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22123 [49] completely to the left-handed mixing\nmatrix which, in combination with the final equation in Eq. 2.5, determines the full set of Wolfenstein\nL ) = A\u03bb3 \u03c1 =\nparameters. Using the set of parameters obtained in this way, we can then determine Re(Vub\n\u22123\n(1.6 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 . This leads to a range of allowed values for the real part of the corresponding element\nof the right-handed mixing matrix\nR\nRe(Vub\n) = (\u22123.1 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn what follows, we will interpret these bounds as the necessary bounds on the strength of the loopinduced RHCC to alleviate the |Vub | tension.\n\n3\n\nA Leptophobic Z 0\n\nOur spin 1 benchmark model is that of a new neutral Z 0 boson. This is a well studied extension of the SM\nand can arise naturally in beyond SM scenarios which involve the breaking of new gauge symmetries. A\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fleptophobic version of the Z 0 model has been studied recently in the context of the tt asymmetry [16, 26\u2013\n31]. In this particular version the Z 0 has a flavor changing, chiral coupling to uR and tR . Any coupling to uL\nand tL must necessarily involve an interaction between the first and third generation quark doublets which,\n\u2217 V d \u03b3 \u03bc b Z 0 . Constraints on the mass difference\nin the mass basis, leads to a coupling of the form fL Vud\nL \u03bc\ntb L\n0\n\nbetween Bd0 and B d restrict the size of the left handed coupling such that fL < 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (MZ 0 /100 GeV)\n[28] and it is therefore usually neglected completely. If the Z 0 only interacts with uR and tR then its\nonly available decay mode is Z 0 \u2192 t\u0304R uR , \u016bR tR which will lead to too many same sign top events at the\nTevatron through the production mechanisms u\u016b \u2192 Z 0 Z 0 \u2192 tt\u016b\u016b and gu \u2192 tZ 0 \u2192 tt\u016b. In order to avoid\nthis, a small flavor diagonal coupling to up-type quarks, \u000fU \u016bi,R \u03b3 \u03bc ui,R Z\u03bc0 , is usually introduced [16, 26]\nto open up other more favorable decay modes. As long as the Z 0 is lighter than the top quark the new\nflavor diagonal decay mode to u\u016b will be the preferred one. However, \u000fU cannot be too large either as it\nis subject to dijet constraints at the Tevatron and can, in conjunction with the large t\u016b coupling, enhance\nthe rate for the normally GIM and loop suppressed rare top decay t \u2192 gu. Additionally, if the Z 0 is much\nlighter than the top quark (MZ 0 . 120 GeV) then this could lead to a large branching ratio for the decay\nt \u2192 Z 0 u which would manifest itself as a large difference in the measurement of the total tt\u0304 production\ncross section as measured in the lepton + jets and dilepton channels. A greater proximity of the Z 0 mass\nto the top quark mass will suppress the t \u2192 Z 0 u branching ratio and prevent these large discrepancies.\nAside from the Tevatron, the same coupling which generates the tt\u0304 asymmetry also necessarily leads\nto ample production of same-sign top quarks at the LHC. The limits on the flavor changing coupling and\nthe Z 0 mass from requiring consistency with a large FBA and the measured tt\u0304 production cross section at\nthe Tevatron were investigated in [27, 29, 30] for a heavy Z 0 (MZ 0 \u2265 200 GeV). Following this, the CMS\ncollaboration searched for same-sign tt production and concluded that the heavy Z 0 exchange explanation\nof the FBA is disfavored at greater than 2\u03c3 [32]. We therefore focus our attention here on the still\nphenomenologically viable light Z 0 explanation of the Tevatron FBA (MZ 0 . 200 GeV).\nAlthough a flavor diagonal coupling to lighter up type quarks was previously employed to avoid too\nmany same sign top events at the Tevatron, we see no reason why this flavor diagonal coupling need be in\nthe up-type quark sector. In particular, since we are interested in the effect of such a flavor changing Z 0\non b \u2192 u transitions in B meson decays we instead opt for a flavor diagonal coupling to bb\u0304. In addition to\nproviding an alternative decay mode for the Z 0 in order to avoid too many same sign top quark pairs at the\nTevatron this coupling also avoids dijet constraints by relying on parton luminosity suppression and does\nnot lead to any enhancements of the rare top decay t \u2192 gu. It is, however, constrained by observables\nassociated with Z \u2192 bb\u0304 and rare B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 decays. All of these constraints are discussed below. Aside from\nthe constraints, the introduction of the new flavor diagonal coupling also leads to an interesting signature\nof single top quark production with an associated bb\u0304 resonance which may be searched for at the LHC\nor in the existing data sets at the Tevatron. Specifically, we consider the following phenomenologically\nmotivated lagrangian\nL = gutZ 0 u\u03b3 \u03bc PR tZ 0\u03bc + gbbZ 0 b\u03b3 \u03bc PR bZ 0\u03bc + h.c.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe right-handed coupling to bb\u0304 was chosen to loosen the constraints from the observable Rb which\nwill be discussed shortly. Note that these types of couplings need not be generated by charging standard\nmodel fields under a new U 0 (1). Instead the Z 0 can couple to the quark fields via higher dimensional\neffective operators [67].\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f2.5\n\nExcluded\n\n2.0\n\ngbbZ'\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\nMZ'\nFigure 1. The red region is excluded by constraints from the observable Rb .\n\nIn principle, the new Z 0 is free to undergo kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson which,\nafter spontaneous symmetry breaking, will induce Z-Z 0 mixing. Adherence to constraints from electroweak\nprecision data (EWPD) and the need to avoid the generation of any large effective leptonic couplings to\nthe Z 0 demand that such mixing be highly suppressed (. 10\u22123 [68]). We therefore treat this mixing as\nnegligible in what follows. This corresponds to choosing the tree level value of the mixing such that the\nfull amplitude (tree level plus 1-loop) falls below the necessary bound.\nAn important constraint on the mass of the Z 0 and the coupling gbbZ 0 is the observable Rb , associated\nwith the decay Z \u2192 bb. The introduction of the flavor diagonal coupling gbbZ 0 modifies the Zbb vertex at\n+ \u03b4gbL,R . These shifts can be\nthe 1-loop level, shifting the SM tree level couplings such that gbL,R \u2192 gbSM\nL,R\ndetected through their effects on the observable Rb , defined as\nRb =\n\n\u0393(Z \u2192 bb)\n=\nP\n\u0393(Z \u2192 Hadrons)\n\n)2\n)2 + (gbSM\n(gbSM\nR\nL\n\u0012\n\u0013.\nSM\nSM\n2\n2\ni=u,d,c,s,b (giL ) + (giR )\n\n(3.2)\n\nIt is standard to normalize the Z \u2192 bb width with the total hadronic width as this leads to the\ncancellation of many QCD and electroweak corrections, thereby magnifying the sensitivity to the NP.

Assuming the ratio m2b /MZ2 0 is negligible, only the right-handed Zbb coupling is\nshifted due to the polarization of the Z 0 bb vertex. At the 1-loop level the overall shift in the coupling is\ncomprised of contributions from Z-Z 0 mixing through a b quark loop, mass renormalization of the external\nb quark lines, and the vertex correction.

In this limit, the finite RHCC are then\nsolely due to the finite contributions from the diagrams in FIG. 2(a) and FIG. 2(b).\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f1.4\n1.2\n\ngutZ'\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\nMZ'\nFigure 3. The Vub tension is removed in both the blue and the purple region. In the blue region, the flavor diagonal\ncoupling, gbbZ 0 , is set to its maximum value at each value of MZ 0 as set by constraints from Rb . In the purple region,\nwe have set gbbZ 0 to half of its maximum value at each value of MZ 0 . The red dot indicates the best fit point of\nreference [16] for reproducing the tt asymmetry.\n\nNote that the result is severely CKM as well as chiral suppressed. Even in the extreme case of\nchoosing unreasonably large values for both couplings gutZ 0 = gbbZ 0 = 5, an extremely light value of MZ 0 ,\ne.g., MZ 0 = 100 GeV, and assuming the loop function is O(1) we find VtbR ' 10\u22129 which is far below the\nindirect limits set by Br(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3).\nThe RHCC in B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays, as shown in FIG. 2(b), however enjoys a chiral enhancement in\ncomparison and is also CKM allowed.

We note here that the\npreferred region of parameter space in FIG. 3 contains the best fit point of reference for reproducing the\ntt asymmetry as well as avoiding large branching ratios for the decays t \u2192 Z 0 u [16].\nThe introduction of the new flavor diagonal bb\u0304 coupling also opens up the possibility of a new and\ninteresting hadron collider signature in the form of a single top quark in association with a bb\u0304 pair and no\n/ T than already associated with the top quark. The dominant production occurs when the bb\u0304 pair\nmore E\nis produced resonantly as shown in FIG. 4(a) and FIG. 4(b).

Figures a) and b) show the diagrams for single top production in association with a bb\u0304 pair from on-shell\nZ 0 decay. Figure c) shows the inclusive cross sections for this signal at the LHC and the Tevatron.\n\nby examining the invariant mass distribution of the bb\u0304 pair for the characteristic resonance peak. As\nwell, as far as we can tell, there have been no searches for this particular signal. The SM background\nproceeds through off-shell W + boson decays or the exchange of both W + bosons and heavy flavor quarks\nin the t-channel and therefore has extra phase space suppression as well as CKM suppression compared\nto the signal. In FIG. 4(c) we display the inclusive cross sections for the resonant case as a function of\nthe Z 0 mass at both the Tevatron and the LHC. The resonant production cross section is the product\nof the tZ 0 production cross section and the Z 0 \u2192 bb\u0304 branching ratio, \u03c3 = \u03c3(ug \u2192 tZ 0 )Br(Z 0 \u2192 bb\u0304).\nSince the Z 0 can only decay to bb\u0304 or an off-shell top with a light jet and both the couplings involved\nare O(1), the branching ratio for Br(Z 0 \u2192 bb\u0304) is essentially unity. Both cross sections are calculated for\ngutZ 0 = gbbZ 0 = 1, however, the rates for other values of gutZ 0 and gbbZ 0 are obtained from \u03c3(gutZ 0 , gbbZ 0 ) =\n2\n2\n\u03c3(gutZ 0 = 1, gbbZ 0 = 1)gutZ\n0 gbbZ 0 .\nThe signal events are generated using MADGRAPH 5 version 1.3.29 [69] with the CTEQ6L1 parton\ndistribution functions (pdfs) [70] and the renormalization and factorization scales fixed to the MADGRAPH 5 value of the top quark mass, mt = 174.3 GeV. Although the cross sections in FIG. 4(c) are\nquite large we expect the rates to reduce drastically once more relevant values of the NP couplings are\nused and application of kinematic cuts, detector simulation, and b-tagging efficiencies have been properly\naccounted for. We also briefly note here that, although the signal does not match any of the SM single top\nproduction signals, it should still be possible to use inclusive single top production cross section measure-\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fments as a constraint on the signal. As our goal for this paper is simply to demonstrate a possible viable\nconnection between the tt\u0304 FBA and the tension in the determinations of |Vub | we leave a more detailed\nanalysis of the collider signatures for future work.\n\n4\n\nColor Singlet Weak Doublet Scalars\n\nThe possibility of a new scalar boson which couples to quarks with a non-trivial flavor structure has been\nstudied by many authors recently [8, 18, 19, 21, 28, 34, 35, 72\u201376]. In terms of the top quark FBA there\nare eight scalar representations capable of producing the desired interference effect with the SM however\nonly one is a color singlet. As this representation seems to have the least amount of tension with the\nmeasurement of the tt production cross section and invariant mass distribution [30] we choose to focus\nour efforts on it. In what follows, our results heavily rely on the previous work of [76] and we therefore\nrefer the reader to this reference for further details.\n!\n\u03c60\nThe color singlet representation is given by (1, 2)\u22121/2 and can be parametrized as \u03a6 =\nwith\n\u03c6\u2212\nthe relevant interactions\n\nL \u2283 Xij QiL \u03a6ujR + X\u0303ij QiL \u03a6\u0303djR + h.c.\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere i, j are flavor indices, uiR and diR are the SUL (2) singlet quarks, and QiL = (uiL djL Vij\u2217 ) in the\nmass basis. In order to account for the tt asymmetry by t-channel exchange it is necessary to allow for\nan O(1) coupling between the top quark and a first generation quark. Flavor constraints imply that the\nfirst generation quark doublet should be avoided and that the O(1) coupling responsible for generating\nthe asymmetry can be associated with either uR or dR , dubbed \"Case II\" and \"Case VI\" respectively in\n[76], but not both. Although a coupling to dR can provide for a large FBA, this cannot be done without\nrunning into cross section constraints so we will further focus our attention on Case II where the form of\nthe coupling matrix, Xij , is restricted to\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nVub 0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nXij = \u03bb \uf8ed Vcb 0 0 \uf8f8\nVtb 0 0\n\n(4.2)\n\nwith \u03bb \u223c O(1). For our purposes we also wish to introduce a flavor diagonal bb\u0304 coupling in the down\nquark sector.

Considering\nLEPII searches we also restrict ourselves to a lower limit of m0 \u2265 100 GeV. We note briefly the existence\nof new terms in our model which alter tt\u0304 production. However, since the only process which is altered by\nthe added terms is bb\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304, which is highly parton luminosity suppressed anyway, these alterations have\nno significant effect on the total production cross section or the FBA at the Tevatron.\n0\n0\nSince flavor constraints, in particular K 0 -K and D0 -D mixing constraints, disfavor a large coupling\nto the right-handed top quark there are no RHCC in top decays and the model remains free from indirect\nB \u2192 Xs \u03b3 constraints. As well, because we do not add a coupling to the s quark, the model also\nremains free from direct B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 constraints. The neutral scalar is complex and is parametrized as\n\u03c60 = \u221a12 (\u03c60R + i\u03c60I ), leading to both scalar and pseudoscalar current diagrams contributing to the RHCC\nin B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays. Of these contributions only six of the diagrams are CKM allowed, which we show\nin FIG. 5. Other contributions are neglected as they are CKM suppressed and do not greatly affect our\nresults. The strength of the RHCC depends on the normalized masses of the neutral and charged scalars,\n2 , where i = R, I, + denotes the real, pseudo, and charged scalar masses. We find that the\nxi = m2i /MW\nRHCC vanishes for zero mass splitting between the real and pseudo scalars and instead prefers a large\nsplitting and a small charged scalar mass.

If both the scalar and pseudoscalar masses are bound\nsuch that 100 GeV \u2264 mR0 , mI0 \u2264 130 GeV then we find that the loop function peaks for mR = 130 GeV\nand mI = m+ = 100 GeV.\nThe authors of [76] found that the parameter space of \"case II\" remained unconstrained by Rb bounds\nhowever, in light of the new flavor diagonal coupling gbb\u03c6 , these bounds must be revisited anew. We find\nseven diagrams, all topologically similar to the RHCC diagrams, contributing to Rb . The shifts in the Zbb\ncouplings are also finite, with the logarithmic divergences cancelling in the same pattern as in the RHCC,\nand have the following form\n\u0012\n\u03b4gbL =\n\ngbb\u03c6\n4\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0012\nC0 (zR , zI ) +\n\n\u03bb\n4\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0012\nD0 (z+ )\n\n\u03b4gbR =\n\ngbb\u03c6\n4\u03c0\n\n\u00132\nE0 (zR , zI , z+ )\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere zi = m2i /MZ2 with i = +, R, I and the above loop functions taking the values\n\nC0 (zR , zI ) = 0.024\n\nD0 (z+ ) = \u22120.016\n\nE0 (zR , zI , z+ ) = \u22120.5\n\n(4.8)\n\nR preferred values for the masses are chosen. We find that there exists a region of parameter\nwhen the Vub\nspace which remains free from Rb constraints and also coincides with the preferred parameter space for\nthe removal of the |Vub | tension which we present in FIG. 6. Although the opposite signs and similar\nmagnitudes of the C0 (zR , zI ) and D0 (z+ ) loop functions imply the existence of a non-trivial region of\ncancellation in FIG. 6 this region does not present itself within the perturbative regime of the couplings.\nWe also note here that the region in which the |Vub | tension is alleviated corresponds to the region in\nwhich a large top quark FBA can be generated.\nDue to the existence of new couplings between the top and bottom quarks and the charged and neutral\nscalars, whose masses are set at O(100) GeV to accommodate a large RHCC, multiple new decay modes\nfor the top quark are opened up.

The CDF collaboration has performed a direct measurement of the\nt\ntop quark width using tt\u0304 events produced in pp\u0304 collisions at the Tevatron and set an upper limit of \u0393t < 7.6\nGeV [77]. The D0 collaboration has also recently released an indirect determination of the total width of\nthe top quark by combining the measurements of the single top t-channel production cross section and\nthe branching ratio Br(t \u2192 W b) as measured in tt\u0304 events leading to the result \u0393t = 2.00+0.47\n\u22120.43 [79]. Using\n|Vtb | = 1 and mt = 174.3 GeV and the RHCC preferred values of the scalar masses the parameter regions\nwhich satisfy the top width bounds are also presented in FIG. 6.\nThe D0 collaboration has also performed a model independent measurement of the t-channel single\ntop quark production cross section \u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 tbq + X) = 2.90 \u00b1 0.59 pb [80] where tbq = tb\u0304q + t\u0304bq, which\nis in good agreement with the SM prediction [81]. At the Tevatron single top quarks are produced in the\nt-channel by exchange of a W boson between a light quark and a b quark from the sea. Since the sea is\nflavor symmetric the presence of a b quark in the initial state guarantees the presence of an anti b quark\nin the final state. In the phenomenological model in which we work, Eq. 4.4, single top production in the\nt-channel can arise from 2 \u2192 2 processes or 2 \u2192 3 processes. In the 2 \u2192 2 processes, the signal could\nbe generated by either neutral or charged scalar exchange. For neutral scalar exchange, uq \u2192 tq 0 , either\nneither q or q 0 are b quarks, in which case there is no b quark in the final state, or both q and q 0 are b\nquarks, in which case there are too many b quarks in the final state. For charged scalar exchange, in order\nto get a single top in the final state a b quark needs to be extracted from the sea leading to the presence of\na b quark in the final state. However, since all charged scalar interactions involve a b quark, the presence\nof too many b quarks in the end state is guaranteed. The same issue occurs in all 2 \u2192 3 processes which\nleads us to conclude that the constraint does not directly apply.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fAs mentioned before in the context of the leptophobic Z 0 model, there exist tight constraints associated\nwith the non-observation of a significant amount of same-sign top quark events at both the Tevatron and\nthe LHC. In the phenomenological model which we use the only production mode is uu \u2192 tt via t and u\nchannel exchange of the real and pseudo scalars. Although this limit strongly constrains the leptophobic\nZ 0 we find that the color singlet weak doublet scalar model is not strongly bound by these results due to\na cancellation between the real and pseudo scalar contributions which is exact in the limit of degenerate\nscalar masses. This cancellation occurs because the neutral scalar is, unlike the Z 0 , complex and, for this\nreason, we find that the model remains free from same sign top constraints.\nWe also note briefly that dijet constraints are not relevant here due to a combination of the cancellation described above as well as CKM and parton luminosity suppression in conjunction with large SM\nbackgrounds.\nAs before, the introduction of the new bb\u0304 coupling also leads to the new signal discussed earlier, i.e;\n/ T than already associated\nsingle top with a bb\u0304 pair from an on-shell decay of a new particle and no more E\nwith the top quark. In this case, the new particles are the real and pseudo scalars and the diagrams are\nthe same as in FIG. 4(a) and FIG. 4(b) except with \u03c60R , \u03c60I in place of the Z 0 . The total cross section is\nP\ngiven by the sum \u03c3 = i=R,I \u03c3(ug \u2192 t\u03c60i )Br(\u03c60i \u2192 bb\u0304) and the branching ratios are, again, essentially\nunity due to CKM suppression of all other decay modes. For illustrative purposes we choose the RHCC\n2 43.8 pb at the LHC for \u221as = 7 TeV\npreferred values for the scalar masses which leads to \u03c3 = \u03bb2 gbb\u03c6\n2 0.60 pb at the Tevatron with \u221as = 1.96 TeV. The signal events were generated with\nand \u03c3 = \u03bb2 gbb\u03c6\nMADGRAPH 5 and the CTEQ6L1 pdfs with both the renormalization and factorization scales set to the\ntop mass. Again, we postpone a more involved analysis of the signal for future work.\n\n5\n\nFlavor Violating Squark Mass Insertions in the MSSM\n\nIn the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) the largest contribution to the loop-induced\nRHCC comes from gluino-squark loops. In this case, the flavor violation resides in the squark sector as\nopposed to the quark sector and is due to the fact that the bi-unitary rotations which diagonalize the\nSM quark mass terms do not necessarily diagonalize the squark mass terms or the Higgs-squark-squark\ncouplings. As well as flavor violation these rotations also induce chiral mixing between squark states after\nthe Higgs doublets acquire their respect vevs, generally leading to non-diagonal 6\u00d76 mass matrices for both\nthe up and down type squarks. In [71] bounds on the flavor off-diagonal elements of these mass matrices\nwere derived by requiring that no large cancellations between tree level SM CKM elements and SUSY loop\ncorrections occur. Since the SM CKM elements reside completely in the left-handed quark sector, this\nleaves mixing associated with the right-handed quark sector relatively unconstrained. In [57] this freedom\nwas exploited to show that a loop-induced RHCC generated within the MSSM from a finite gluino-squark\nloop can alleviate the |Vub | tension. We revisit this calculation here, emphasizing the importance of the\nparticular flavor violating chiral squark mass insertions involved.\nIn FIG. 7(a) and FIG. 7(b) we present the dominant gluino-squark loop diagrams which generate the\nRHCC in top and B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays in the MSSM. We have chosen to work in the super-CKM basis and\ntreat the flavor off-diagonal elements of the squark mass matrices, written as \u2206q\u0303,XY\nin the notation of\nij\nXY\nXY\n2\n[71], as perturbations. We also define the dimensionless quantities \u03b4ij = \u2206ij /mq\u0303 and take all squark\n1X 2\nmasses to be equal to the average squark mass m2q\u0303 =\nmq\u0303s .\n6 s\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fg\u0303\n\ng\u0303\n\n\u2206u,LR\n33\ntR\n\nt\u0303R\n\n\u2206d,LR\n33\n\n\u2206d,RL\n33\nt\u0303L\n\nb\u0303L\n\nb\u0303R\n\nbR\n\nbR\n\nb\u0303R\n\n\u2206u,RL\n13\nt\u0303L\n\nb\u0303L\n\n\u0169R\n\nuR\n\nW\u2212\n\nW\u2212\n\n(a) The dominant gluino-squark loop contribution to\nthe RHCC associated with top decay.\n\n(b) The dominant gluino-squark loop contribution to\nthe RHCC associated with B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays.\n\nFigure 7.\n\nThe dominant RHCC in top decay involves only chiral mixing elements in the squark mass matrix\nwhich are not constrained by flavor observables.

Such a model is presented in [83] which we dub the Isidori-Kamenik model. The model\ncan be thought of as an extension of the MSSM to include a new light SU (2)L \u00d7 UY (1) singlet majoranna\nparticle, \u03c70 , which interacts with the right-handed stop and each of the up type SM quarks. For our\npurposes we add to the Isidori-Kamenik model a flavor diagonal bR b\u0303R \u03c70 coupling so that the lagrangian\ncan be written as\n\nL = LM SSM + |D\u03bc t\u0303R |2 \u2212 m2t\u0303R t\u0303\u2020R t\u0303R + \u03c70 i\u03b3\u03bc D\u03bc \u03c70 \u2212 m\u03c7 \u03c70 c \u03c70 +\n\nX\n\n\u1ef8q q R t\u0303R \u03c70 + Yb bR b\u0303R \u03c70 + h.c. (5.4)\n\nq=u,c,t\n\nIn order to generate a large FBA and maintain a small impact on cross section measurements the\nparameter space must be restricted such that 200 . mt\u0303R . 205 GeV, \u1ef8u & 1.5, \u1ef8t \u223c 4, and m\u03c7 \u223c 2 GeV.\nWe further conservatively choose our sbottom masses such that mb\u0303 = MSU SY = 2 TeV to be consistent\nwith LHC SUSY particle searches. The diagrams contributing to top and B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays are the same\nas in the MSSM with the gluino replaced by \u03c70 . Using the prescribed parameter space we find the RHCC\nin top and B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays can be written as\nd,RL u,LR\nVtbR = Yb \u03b433\n\u03b433 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22122\nd,LR u,RL\nR\nVub\n= Yb \u03b433\n\u03b413 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n(5.5)\n\n\fTaking the mass insertions in VtbR to be both equal to 1 we require Yb . 0.38 to satisfy Br(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)\nconstraints. Using the maximum value of Yb then allows us to plot the parameter space for which the\n|Vub | tension is removed in FIG. 8(b).\nSince the stop masses are heavier than the top quark mass there are no new top decay modes opened\nup. It has also been noted that, considering the small size of t\u0303R t\u0303\u2020R production compared to the dominant\nSM backgrounds, constraints from single top production are not expected to be particularly strong [83].\nAlthough same sign top events can occur through t-channel exchange of the Majorana particle \u03c70 and\nsubsequent t\u0303R decays this is severely suppressed by the ratio (m\u03c7 /mt\u0303R )2 , leading to cross sections well\nbelow current bounds.\nWith the introduction of the flavor diagonal bR b\u0303R \u03c70 coupling, one might question whether this can\nlead to non-trivial constraints from the new decay mode of the Upsilon meson, \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03c70 \u03c70 , via an\n4\nintermediate sbottom squark in the t-channel. The decay rate can be estimated as \u223c Yb4 m5\u03a5 /2\u03c0MSU\nSY =\n\u221211\n\u22126\n1.6 \u00d7 10\nGeV, using Yb = 0.38, whereas the total Upsilon width is \u0393\u03a5 = 54 \u00d7 10 GeV [49]. Since the\n0\n\u03c7 's are light and SM singlets they would contribute to the Br(\u03a5 \u2192 invisible) branching ratio, for which the\ncurrent limits are Br(\u03a5 \u2192 invisible) < 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 at 90% C.L. [49]. We find that Br(\u03a5 \u2192 \u03c70 \u03c70 ) \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\nwhich lies well within the current bounds.\nFinally, we also briefly note here that the Isidori-Kamenik model does not have the bb\u0304 type coupling\nwhich would lend itself to the new single top with bb\u0304 pair signal discussed in the previous two sections.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nRecent measurements of the FBA of the top quark in tt production at the Tevatron have inspired many new\nphysics models which incorporate a new flavor changing coupling involving the first and third generation\nquarks as well as some new mediator which can be scalar or vector in character. It was also shown recently\nthat the effect of right-handed couplings of SM quarks to the W boson, or right handed charge currents,\ncan alleviate the tension between the determinations of |Vub | from exclusive and inclusive measurements\nas well as from the rare leptonic B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays. We have studied the effect of such new flavor changing\ncouplings on the size of loop-induced right-handed charge currents, making the connection between the tt\u0304\nasymmetry and the |Vub | tension by adding to each of the benchmark models considered a flavor diagonal\ncoupling to bb\u0304. The effect of such a flavor changing coupling is to simultaneously enhance right-handed\ncharge currents in B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays, which allows for the removal of the |Vub | tension, and suppress them\nin non-standard top decays which frees the given model from existing indirect yet strong Br(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)\nconstraints. This situation comes about for various reasons: for a new scalar (vector) mediator the flavor\nchanging coupling provides CKM (as well as chiral) enhancements in B \u2192 Xu `\u03bd decays while concurrently\nproviding CKM (as well as chiral) suppression in non-standard top decays. We have also revisited and\nconfirmed the possibility that the right-handed charge current generated by flavor violating squark mass\ninsertions in the MSSM can alleviate the |Vub | tension. The critical mechanism at work here is similar\nto the new flavor changing coupling in that mixing between the stop and sup squarks can be large as it\nis relatively unconstrained and leads to an otherwise absent CKM enhancement. The extended IsidoriKamenik model was also shown to have the ability to alleviate the |Vub | tension through a flavor changing\ncoupling between stop squarks and up quarks leading to the same CKM enhancement. We have also noted\nthat the addition of the new flavor changing coupling associated with the tt\u0304 asymmetry in conjunction\nwith the flavor diagonal bb\u0304 coupling generates a new signal which can be searched for at hadron colliders.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fIf searches are unsuccessful then the associated bounds on the cross section stand to rule out the proposed\npossible connection between the tt\u0304 asymmetry and the |Vub | tension.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Abhishek Kumar, David Morrissey, and Sean Tulin for valuable comments and helpful\ndiscussions.
