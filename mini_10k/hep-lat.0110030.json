We use an order \u03b12s a2 , a4 Symanzik improved gauge action and an order \u03b1s a2 , a4 improved\nstaggered quark action. The improved staggered action leads to a dispersion relation with diminished\nlattice artifacts, and hence better thermodynamic properties. It decreases the flavor symmetry breaking\nof staggered quarks substantially, and we estimate that at the transition temperature for an Nt = 8\nto Nt = 10 lattice all pions will be lighter than the lightest kaon. Preliminary results on lattices with\nNt = 4, 6 and 8 are presented.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nWith the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) now producing data, it has become even more important to understand the phase diagram of QCD at finite temperature, and to determine properties of the\nhigh temperature quark-gluon-plasma phase with confidence, i.e. with controlled lattice spacing errors.\nIt is fairly well established that QCD with two flavors of massless quarks has a second order finite\ntemperature, chiral symmetry restoring phase transition. This transition is washed out as soon as the\nquarks become massive. QCD with three flavors of massless quarks has a first order finite temperature,\nchiral symmetry restoring phase transition, which is stable for small quark masses. Not well known is how\nlarge the quark masses can be before the phase transition turns second order and then into a crossover,\nboth for degenerate quarks and especially for the physically relevant case of two light and one heavier\nstrange quark.\nIn previous studies, the second question is particularly badly answered due to the flavor symmetry\nbreaking in Kogut-Susskind quarks, usually used for this purpose: how can one study the influence of\nthe strange quark when most of the (non-Goldstone) pions are heavier than the (Goldstone) kaon?\nAdding a few terms to the conventional Kogut-Susskind action, namely three-link, five-link and sevenlink staples and a third-neighbor coupling, removes all tree-level O(a2 ) errors [1\u20133]. This \"Asqtad\"\naction shows improved flavor and rotational symmetry [2,4], and, at least in quenched QCD, good scaling\nproperties [5]. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. There, and in other figures below, we plot results in units of\nr1 , a scale defined in terms of the static QQ\u0304 potential by r12 FQQ\u0304static (r1 ) = 1, which leads to r1 \u223c 0.35\nfm [6].\n\u2217 Preprint\n\nFSU-CSIT-01-50.

The \"Asqtad\" action gives the smallest flavor\nsymmetry breaking.

The energy density (left) and pressure (right) of free massless fermions as function of temporal\nlattice size Nt . For free fermions the \"Asqtad\" action reduces to the Naik action. The \"p4\" action is the\nimproved staggered fermion action preferred by the Bielefeld group [7].\n\nThe three-link \"Naik\" term insures a good dispersion relation and thereby helps decrease the lattice\nartifacts in energy density and pressure at small temporal lattice size Nt , as can be seen in Fig. 2.\nBased on the zero temperature simulations of Ref. [4] and the estimate of Tc \u223c 150 \u2212 170 MeV [8] we\ndeduce that for Nt = 8 \u2212 10 the kaon will be heavier than the heaviest non-Goldstone pion at the finite\ntemperature transition.\nWe have zero temperature results, in particular, the value of the (bare) strange quark mass, at fixed\nlattice spacing a \u223c 0.13 fm and a \u223c 0.2 fm. Since we want to keep the physical quark masses approximately constant, when we vary the temperature which, at fixed Nt = 1/(aT ), means varying the gauge\ncoupling \u03b2, we interpolated (extrapolated) between the values at the two lattice spacings.\nGiven a gauge coupling \u03b2 and quark mass amq , for the three-flavor simulations, or quark masses ams\nand amu,d , for 2 + 1 flavors, we determined the tadpole factor u0 = (TrUp /3)1/4 self-consistently in short\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3.

The spatial lattice\nsizes are Ns = 2Nt .\n\nFigure 4. h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i for three flavors with mq \u2248 ms (left) and mq \u2248 0.6ms (right).\n\nzero temperature simulations on L4 lattices.\nTo convert lattice scales to physical scales we interpolated a/r1 with the form advocated by Allton [9]\n\u0002\n\u0003\na/r1 = c0 f (g02 ) 1 + c2 g02 f 2 (g02 ) ,\n\n\u0012\n2\nf (g02 ) = (b0 g02 )\u2212b1 /(2b0 ) exp \u2212\n\n1\n2b0 g02\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nFor the (one-loop, tadpole) Symanzik improved gauge action the bare coupling g02 is related to \u03b2 by\ng02 = 10/\u03b2. b0,1 are the universal first two coefficients of the beta-function for three massless flavors, and\nc0,2 are determined from the measured values of a/r1 at a \u223c 0.13 fm and a \u223c 0.2 fm.\nThe Hybrid Molecular Dynamics R-algorithm was used for all simulations, with two noise vectors for\nthe 2 + 1 flavor simulations.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 5.

RESULTS FOR THREE DEGENERATE FLAVORS\nFor our first simulation with mq \u2248 ms we used a linear interpolation of amq (\u03b2) in \u03b2. Since the range\nof interpolation/extrapolation is quite large, we subsequently used a linear interpolation of log(amq (\u03b2)),\ncompatible with the leading behavior of a (with mq fixed) as function of \u03b2. In the region of the finite\ntemperature transition or crossover for lattices with temporal extent Nt = 6 and 8, the difference between\nthe two interpolation schemes is small enough that it will not affect our results significantly.\nWe show in Fig. 3 the real part of the Polyakov line and in Fig. 4 the condensate as function of the\ntemperature, with the physical scale obtained via r1 , for our simulations with three degenerate quarks\nof mass mq \u2248 ms and mq \u2248 0.6ms . The Polyakov line shows a crossover from confined behavior at low\ntemperature to a deconfined behavior at high temperature. The condensate decreases as the temperature\nis increased, but shows no sign of a transition or sharp crossover.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the chiral susceptibility, \u03c7\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 = \u2202h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i/\u2202mq from the simulations with mq \u2248 ms for\nlattices with Nt = 6 and 8. A peak is seen in both cases. But the peak height does not increase when we\nchange the spatial lattice size from Ns = 2Nt to 3Nt , indicating that we are observing a smooth crossover\nfrom a chirally symmetric phase at high temperature (large \u03b2) to a phase of broken chiral symmetry\nat low temperature. The location of the peak coincides approximately with the steep increase of the\nPolyakov line in Fig. 3. The chiral susceptibility for mq \u2248 0.6ms looks similar to Fig. 5, but in that case\nwe have, so far, results only for one spatial size, Ns = 2Nt .\n3. RESULTS FOR 2+1 FLAVORS\nWe have also preliminary results from simulations with 2+1 dynamical flavors, with the heavier quark\nkept at the strange quark mass, and the lighter masses at mu,d = 0.6ms and 0.4ms . The real part of the\nPolyakov line and the light quark condensate from these simulations are shown in Fig. 6. Again we see a\ncrossover behavior, particularly for the Polyakov line. For these simulations we do not have the data yet\nto compute the chiral susceptibility.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have made first simulations to explore the finite temperature phase diagram with an improved\nstaggered fermion action, the \"Asqtad\" action, which reduces flavor symmetry breaking so that all pions\nare lighter than the kaon already at larger lattice spacing, and which improves rotational symmetry and\nthe dispersion relation, leading to diminished lattice artifacts in energy density and pressure.\nFor three flavor simulations down to quark mass mq \u2248 0.6ms , and for 2+1 flavor simulations with the\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 6. Real part of the Polyakov line (left) and h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i for the light quarks (right) for 2+1 flavors. The\nPolyakov line data for Nt = 8 has been multiplied by two.\n\nlight quark masses down to mu,d = 0.4ms while the heavier quark is kept at the strange quark mass, we\nobserved finite temperature crossover behavior, but so far no sign of a genuine phase transition. This\nresult is compatible with other recent simulations [10,11] which found phase transitions only at quark\nmasses lighter than those studied by us so far. The temperature at the crossover, with the scale set by\nr1 , Tc \u223c 190 \u2013 200 MeV, is a little higher than expected from previous determinations [7,8]. This is\npresumably also due to our quark masses still being rather high.\nThis work is supported by the US National Science Foundation and Department of Energy and used\ncomputer resources at Florida State University (SP), NERSC, NPACI, FNAL, and the University of Utah\n(CHPC).\nREFERENCES\n1.
