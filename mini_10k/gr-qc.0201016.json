INTRODUCTION\n\nThe spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by a black hole which has been disturbed is\ndominated, over intermediate timescales, by characteristic frequencies and decay timescales.\nThese can be accurately described in terms of the discrete set of quasinormal modes. The\nfrequencies of these modes can be determined numerically these days to high accuracy up\nto large order [1].\nA new application of the quasinormal mode spectrum has arisen recently from superstring\ntheory. There is a suggestion, known as the ADS-CFT correspondence, that string theory in\nanti-de Sitter space (usually with extra internal dimensions) is equivalent to conformal field\ntheory in one less dimension [3,4]. A black hole, which has a characteristic temperature fixed\nby the Hawking effect, should correspond to CFT at finite temperature and the quasinormal\nmodes would describe non-equilibrium effects [5].\nThe temperature of the black hole is fixed by the surface gravity of the event horizon\n\u03ba1 . The anti-de Sitter space also has a characteristic length scale a which is conventionally\nrefered to as the anti-de Sitter radius. In the non-rotating case, there are two black hole\nsolutions for a given value of the surface gravity [6], a larger one with positive and smaller\none with negative specific heat. Therefore the metric is determined by a, \u03ba1 and the choice\nof the larger or the smaller black hole.\nPrevious work on the quasinormal mode spectrum in anti-de Sitter space has concentrated on the wave equation for scalar fields. Chan et al. [7,8] studied the scalar field problem\nprior to the interest in the ADS-CFT correspondence. Horowitz et al. [9,10] examined the\nscalar spectrum in four and five dimensions. They found simple scaling behaviour of the\nspectrum in both limits r1 \u226b a and r1 \u226a a, the former explained by an approximate\nsymmetry of the metric in that limit.\nGravitational perturbations of the BTZ black hole in three dimensions and the anti-de\nSitter black hole in four dimensions have been studied by Cardoso et al. [11,12]. They make\nuse of the fact that the gravitational perturbation equation is separable in four dimensions\n[13\u201315]. This fact was also used in a preliminary report on our results [16]. The main\ndifference between our work and the work of Cardoso et al. is in the choice of boundary\nconditions on the axial and polar metric perturbations.\nThere is a symmetry which relates the axial and polar metric perturbations, whose\nexistence can be explained by the fact that the covariant form of perturbation analysis\nbased on the Weyl tensor is governed by a single equation [18]. We argue that the thermal\nfluctuations in the energy of the conformal field theory are determined by a single set of\nmodes for which the axial perturbations have dirichlet boundary conditions and the duality\nbetween axial and polar perturbations is preserved. We calculate the quasinormal mode\nfrequencies numerically. For fluctuations in other components of the stress energy tensor\nthere is a one parameter family of boundary conditions and the modes depend weakly on\nthis parameter.\nWe have also investigated the quasinormal mode spectrum for black holes in de Sitter\nspace. An interesting feature of this problem is that the asymptotic behaviour of the modes\nis under better control than the corresponding problem in flat space [1]. The first few modes\nwhere evaluated previously in ref. [13]. Using methods based on continued fractions now\ngives us many thousands of modes. A P\u00f6shl-Teller approximation for the potential works\n2\n\n\fextremely well in this example [16].\nII. DE SITTER SPACE\n\nThe spherically symmetric de Sitter spacetime which contains a black hole has two horizons, one at the event horizon of the black hole and a cosmological horizon further out. In\nstandard coordinates, the metric for a black hole of mass M and for a cosmological constant\n\u039b can be written\nds2 = \u2212\n\n\u2206 2 r2 2\ndt + dr + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 )\nr2\n\u2206\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u2206 = r 2 \u2212 2Mr \u2212 31 \u039br 4 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe event horizon lies at the smallest root r1 of \u2206, where the surface gravity \u03ba1 = r \u22122 \u2206\u2032 /2.\nWe can invert these relations to give\nM = 31 r1 (\u03ba1 r1 + 1)\n\u039b = r1\u22122 (1 \u2212 2\u03ba1 r1 ),\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nshowing, incidentally, that \u03ba1 r1 < 1/2 in de Sitter space.\nThe gravitational wave equations were separated originally for charged black holes [13],\nthen for uncharged [14] and finally for rotating black holes [15]. The metric perturbations can\nbe classified by their axial or polar symmetry under spatial inversions. The transformation\ntheory relating the two types is described in the next section.\nThe axial metric perturbations with time dependence ei\u03c9t and angular mode l are subject\nto a one dimensional scattering equation,\no\nd2 \u03c8 n 2\n+\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nV\n(r)\n\u03c8=0\ndr \u22172\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nV (r) =\n\n6M\n\u2206\nl(l + 1) \u2212\n4\nr\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(6)\n\nThe tortoise coordinate r \u2217 , given as usual by dr \u2217 = r 2 dr/\u2206, covers the range \u2212\u221e < r \u2217 < \u221e\nas r ranges between the two horizons. The potential decays to zero exponentially fast in\nthe r \u2217 coordinate at both horizons. This is an important property which is not present for\nthe black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime and guarantees that the reflection and\ntransmission coefficients are meromorphic functions of the frequency [21].\nBy definition, the quasinormal modes are ingoing waves at the event horizon and outgoing\nwaves at the cosmological horizon,\n\u03c8\u2192\n\n\u001a\n\ne\u2212i\u03c9r\n\u2217\nei\u03c9r\n\n\u2217\n\nas r \u2217 \u2192 \u221e\nas r \u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe method which we use to determine the complex frequencies follows the continued fraction approach devised by Leaver [22]. The idea is to first scale out the divergent behavior\nat the cosmological horizon and examine the resulting Fr\u00f6benius series. If we begin with a\npurely divergent solution at the event horizon, the values of \u03c9 can be chosen to select the\nconvergent rescaled solution at the cosmological horizon.\nThe analysis is slightly easier if we use the independent variable x = 1/r. In de Sitter space, the radial equation has three regular singular points x1 (the event horizon),\nx2 (the cosmological horizon) and x3 . The indices of the equation at these points are\n\u00b1\u03c1i = \u00b1i\u03c9/(2\u03bai ), where\n\u03ba1 = 2M(x1 \u2212 x2 )(x1 \u2212 x3 )\n\u03ba2 = 2M(x2 \u2212 x3 )(x2 \u2212 x1 )\n\u03ba3 = 2M(x3 \u2212 x1 )(x3 \u2212 x2 )\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nNote that \u03c11 + \u03c12 + \u03c13 = 0 and\n\u2217\n\ne\u2212i\u03c9r = (x \u2212 x1 )\u2212\u03c11 (x \u2212 x2 )\u2212\u03c12 (x \u2212 x3 )\u2212\u03c13\n\n(11)\n\nWe define,\n\u2217\n\n\u03c8 = e\u2212i\u03c9r u\n\n(12)\n\nFor a quasinormal mode, u(x) must be divergent at x1 and finite at x2 . The Frobenius series\nis therefore\nu(x) = (x \u2212 x1 )\n\n2\u03c11\n\nX\n\nn=1\n\nan\n\n\u0012\n\nx \u2212 x1\nx2 \u2212 x1\n\n\u0013n\n\n(13)\n\nwhere a0 = 1 and the coefficients satisfy a recurrence relation of the form\n\u03b1n an+1 + \u03b2n an + \u03b3n an\u22121 = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nThe existence of this recurrence relation with only three terms is very important, because\nthe convergence of the Fr\u00f6benius series at x = x2 is now dependent on a continued fraction\nequation,\n0 = \u03b20 \u2212\n\n\u03b10 \u03b3 1 \u03b11 \u03b3 2\n...\n\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 \u2212\n\n(15)\n\nwhich can be solved very quickly numerically.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the real and imaginary parts of the frequency of the l = 2 and l = 3\nmodes as r1 \u03ba1 is varied. The quasinormal modes in flat space are recovered at r1 \u03ba1 = 0.5.\nThe simple shape of the potential suggests that a P\u00f6schl-Teller approximation might be\neffective, as it is for the Schwarzchild black hole [23]. The approximate potential\nVP T = V0 sech2 (r \u2217 /b)\n\n(16)\n\ncontains two free parameters which are used to fit the height and the second derivative of\nthe potential at the maximum. The location of the maximum has to be found numerically.\n4\n\n\fThe quasinormal modes of the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential can be evaluated analytically,\nq\n1\n\u03c9n =\n(n + 1/2)i + b2 V0 \u2212 1/4 .\nb\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(17)\n\nfor n = 1, 2, . . .. These values are compared to the numerical values for l = 2 in figure 1 and\nl = 3 in figure 2. The approximation works best for the imaginary parts of the frequencies,\nbut the differences between the numerical values and the P\u00f6schl-Teller values decrease as l\nis increased and soon become smaller than the resolution of such graphs.\nFor large l it is possible to obtain the P\u00f6schl-Teller fit to the potential analytically. The\nmaximum of the potential in this case lies close to r = 3M. From the second derivative at\nr = 3M, we get\nb\u22121 = \u03ba1 (1 + \u03ba1 r1 )\u22121 (1 + 32 \u03ba1 r1 )1/2\n\n(18)\n\nand b2 V0 = l(l + 1). Equations (3) and (4) have been used to express the result in terms of\nthe surface gravity. The analytic expression for the frequencies is therefore\n\u03c9n = \u03ba1\n\no\n(1 + 32 \u03ba1 r1 )1/2 n\n(n + 1/2)i + (l(l + 1) \u2212 1/4)1/2 .\n1 + \u03ba1 r1\n\n(19)\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the numerical results and the approximation for small l. The difference\nis largest in the flat space limit at the right hand side of the figures. As l is increased, the\ndifference beween the approximation and the numerical results soon becomes insignificant.\nIII. ANTI-DE SITTER SPACE\n\nThe metric for a black hole in anti-de Sitter space takes the same form as for de Sitter\nspace but with \u039b negative. The cosmological horizon is no longer present. We introduce an\nanti-de Sitter radius a by the definition a2 = \u22123/\u039b. For fixed values of \u03ba1 and a there are\ntwo black hole solutions with different radii,\n\u03ba1 r1 = 13 (\u03ba1 a)2 \u00b1\n\n1\n3\n\n\u0010\n\n(\u03ba1 a)4 \u2212 3(\u03ba1 a)2\n\n\u00111/2\n\n(20)\n\nThe larger solution has positive and the smaller one negative specific heat.\nThe axial metric perturbations are subject to the same radial equation as for de Sitter\nspace, however in anti-de Sitter space the tortoise coordinate lies in the range \u2212\u221e < r \u2217 \u2264 0.\nThe boundary conditions at r \u2217 = 0 can be dirichlet, neumann or robin depending respectively\non whether the field, its derivative or a combination of both vanishes. Previous work has\ntended to opt for dirichlet boundary conditions [12], based largely on ADS invariance scalar\nfield theory [24,25]. However, dirichlet boundary conditions break a duality in the equations\nbetween axial and polar metric perturbations [18]. We will introduce a set of self-dual\nboundary conditions based on the ADS-CFT correspondence.\nIn the Newman-Penrose formalism, the gravitational perturbations can be described by\ntwo Weyl scalars \u03a80 and \u03a84 . In flat space, \u03a80 would represent gravitational waves which are\nincoming at infinity and \u03a84 would represent outgoing gravitational waves. The equations\n5\n\n\ffor the Weyl scalars separate to give a generalisation of the Teukolski equations [15]. We\nput, for example,\n\u03a80 = ei\u03c9t\n\nr3\nY (r)Sl (\u03b8)\n\u2206\n\n(21)\n\nwhere Sl (\u03b8) can be found in Chandrasekhar [18]. The radial equation for Y (r) can be related\nto the radial equation for the metric perturbations (5) if we set\nY = V \u00b1 \u03c8 \u00b1 + (W \u00b1 + 2i\u03c9)\u039b+ \u03c8 \u00b1\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\n\u039b+ =\n\nd\n+ i\u03c9.\ndr \u2217\n\n(23)\n\nThere are two equivalent formulations corresponding to polar and axial metric perturbations,\ndenoted by the plus and minus signs. The axial form, corresponding to \u03c8 \u2212 , has V \u2212 (r) = V (r)\ngiven previously (6).\nThe axial and polar functions are related by\nC \u2213 \u03c8 \u2213 = (C \u2213 + 72M 2 f )\u03c8 \u00b1 \u2213 12M\u039b\u2212 \u03c8 \u00b1\n\n(24)\n\nwith C \u00b1 = \u03bc2 (\u03bc2 + 2) \u00b1 12iM\u03c9, and\nf=\n\n\u2206\n1\n.\n3\n2\nr \u03bc r + 6M\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03bc2 = (l \u2212 1)(l + 2).\nThe ADS-CFT correspondence conjectures that when the Anti-de Sitter space is conformally compactified, the generating functions of the conformal field theory on the boudary\nare related to the partition function of the superstring theory on the interior, or\n\u001c\n\nexp\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u0125\u03bc\u03bd T\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0013\u001d\n\nCF T\n\n\u0010\n\n= Z \u0125\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0011\n\n(26)\n\nIf we calculate the correlation fuctions of a polar quantity, such as the energy, we must\ntherefore set the axial metric perturbation to vanish on the boundary. The transformation\ntheory (24) then implies a Robin boundary condition on the polar metric perturbation, i.e.\nthe normal derivative is determined by the value of the field. The same set of quasinormal\nmodes is obtained from the axial and polar equations and the duality between the two is\npreserved.\nIn general, both the axial and polar metric variations are non-vanishing. This is consistent with the conformal theory viewpoint, where the six components of the metric perturbations in three dimensions are subject to three coordinate transformations and the conformal\nsymmetry, leaving two independent functions. If we define the ratio \u03b3 = \u03c8 + /\u03c8 \u2212 , the two\nmetric variations are related by (24), which gives a robin boundary condition\n(\u03be + \u039b\u2212 )\u03c8 \u2212\n6\n\n(27)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03be = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\nC+\n6M\n+ 2 2\n12M\n\u03bca\n\n(28)\n\nSome special solutions lead to vanishing of the Newmann-Penrose scalars and might be\nregarded as pure gauge modes from the point of view of the ADS theory. For example,\n\u2212i\u03c9r \u2217\n\n\u03c8\u2212 = e\n\n6M\n1+ 2\n\u03bcr\n\n!\n\n(29)\n\nwith \u03c9 = \u2212\u03bc2 (\u03bc2 + 2)i/12M, obtained by setting \u03c8 + = 0, is a purely axial perturbation\nwith Y = 0. Replacing \u03c9 by \u2212\u03c9 gives a quasinormal mode with frequency\n\u03c9=\n\n\u03bc2 (\u03bc2 + 2)\ni\n12M\n\n(30)\n\nSuch modes appear in the numerical solutions discussed below.\nThe frequencies of the quasinormal modes can be found numerically by adapting the\nmethod used for de Sitter space. We first scale out the behaviour of the quasinormal mode\nat the event horizon,\n\u03c8 \u2212 = ei\u03c9r u,\n\u2217\n\n(31)\n\nwhere u will be regarded as a function of x = 1/r. The radial equation (5) gives the equation\np u\u2032\u2032 + p\u2032 u\u2032 + 2i\u03c9 u\u2032 + {l(l + 1) \u2212 6Mx} u = 0\n\n(32)\n\nwhere p = \u2212a\u22122 \u2212 x2 + 2Mx3 . We take the Fr\u00f6benius series which is regular at the event\nhorizon,\nu=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nan\n\n\u0012\n\nx \u2212 x1\n\u2212x1\n\n\u0013n\n\n(33)\n\nwith a0 = 1. The coefficients are obtained from a recurrence relation similar to (14). The\nseries can then be substituted into the boundary condition u = 0 at x = 0 to obtain an\nequation for the frequencies of the quasinormal modes with vanishing axial perturbations.\nThe frequencies of the first few modes using dirichlet boundary conditions on the axial\nperturbations have been plotted for a\u03ba1 = 2.0 and r1 = a in figure 3. For l = 2, one of the\nfrequencies lies on the imaginary axis. (This is also found by Cardoso et al [11]). We have\nfound a single frequency on the imaginary axis and can trace it for \u03ba1 r1 \u2265 1.3 when l = 2,\nfor \u03ba1 r1 \u2265 3.4 when l = 3 and for \u03ba1 r1 \u2265 38.0 when l = 10.\nThe dependence of the first three modes on the metric parameters, with l = 2 and\nl = 10, is displayed in figures 3 and 4. Both the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies\nbecome proportional to \u03ba1 for large \u03ba1 , which agrees with the behaviour for the scalar field\nquasinormal modes [10]. For r1 \u226a a, the numerical data suggests that imaginary part of\nthe frequency \u03c9I approaches zero as in the scalar case [10].\nCorresponding results for dirichlet boundary conditions on the polar perturbations (\u03b3 =\n0) are shown in figures 5 and 6. The special mode in this case is the 'pure gauge' mode (30)\n7\n\n\fand the analytic solution provides a good check on the accuracy of our numerical technique.\nThe frequencies for these boundary conditions are not drastically different from the dirichlet\naxial boundary conditions. The two sets of results represent two extreme cases of the one\nparameter family of boundary conditions (27) given above, and indicate a weak dependence\non the parameter \u03b3.\nThe potential V (r) for anti-de Sitter space no longer vanishes as r \u2192 \u221e and it is harder\nto fit the potential to a P\u00f6schl-Teller form. More importantly, the value of r \u2217 at infinity is\nzero, and the asymptotic forms of the mode functions for the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential can no\nlonger be used.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe quasinormal modes for the gravitational perturbations of a black hole in de Sitter\nspace have much in common with the quasinormal modes for the black hole in asymptotically\nflat spacetime. The radial scattering problem in de Sitter space is better behaved because\nthe potential falls off exponentially rather than as a power law. This explains why the\napproximation to the quasinormal mode frequencies, derived in section 2 from a P\u00f6schlTeller potential, is in such good agreement with the numerical results for even moderate\nangular order l.\nThe corresponding problem in anti-de Sitter space requires careful consideration of the\nboundary conditions at infinity. The proposal here has been to use the ADS-CFT correspondence and the duality symmetry between axial and polar metric perturbations. For\ncorrelation functions of the energy in the conformal field theory, the appropriate boundary\nconditions are that the axial metric perturbations vanish and the polar perturbations satisfy\na robin boundary condition.\nIn general, two functions have to be specified on the boundary and there is a one parameter family of boundary conditions. The effect on the quasinormal frequencies is quite\nsmall.\nIt would be desirable to analyse thermal widths in three dimensional conformal field\ntheory to look for signs of a correspondence with the quasinormal mode frequencies found\nhere. This could give an impetus for analysing the five dimensional gravitational quasinormal\nmodes, where a full separation of the gravitational perturbation equations is still an unsolved\nproblem.\n\n8\n\n\fFIGURES\n0.8\n\n2\nexact\nPT\n\nexact\nPT\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c9I\n\n\u03c9R\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\u03ba1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\u03ba1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 1.
