We define two functors from Elias and Khovanov's diagrammatic Soergel category,\none targeting Clark-Morrison-Walker's category of disoriented sl(2) cobordisms and the other\nthe category of (universal) sl(3) foams.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nIn this paper we define functors between the Elias-Khovanov diagrammatic version of the\nSoergel category SC defined in [4] and the categories of universal sl(2) and sl(3)-foams defined\nin [2] and [8].\nThe Soergel category provides a categorification of the Hecke algebra and was used by Khovanov in [6] to construct a triply graded link homology categorifying the HOMFLYPT polynomial. Elias and Khovanov constructed in [4] a category defined diagrammatically by generators\nand relations and showed it to be equivalent to SC.\nThe sl(2) and sl(3)-foams were introduced in [1, 2] and in [7, 8] respectively, to give topological constructions of the sl(2) and sl(3) link homologies.\nThis paper can be seen as a first step towards the construction of a family of functors between\nSC and the categories of sl(N )-foams for all N \u2208 Z+ , to be completed in a subsequent paper [9].\nThe functors Fsl(2),n and Fsl(3),n are not faithful. In [9] we will extend the construction of\nthese functors to all N . The whole family of functors is faithful in the following sense: if for\na morphism f in SC 1 we have Fsl(N ),n (f ) = 0 for all N , then f = 0. With these functors\none can try to give a graphical interpretation of Rasmussen's [10] spectral sequences from the\nHOMFLYPT link homology to the sl(N )-link homologies.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief description of Elias and\nKhovanov's diagrammatic Soergel category. In Section 3 we describe the category Foam2 of\nsl(2)-foams and construct a functor from SC to Foam2 . Finally in Section 4 we give the analogue of these results for the case of sl(3)-foams.\nWe have tried to keep this paper reasonably self-contained. Although not mandatory, some\nacquaintance with [2, 4, 5, 8] is desirable.\n2. T HE\n\nDIAGRAMMATIC\n\nS OERGEL\n\nCATEGORY REVISITED\n\nThis section is a reminder of the diagrammatics for Soergel categories introduced by Elias and\nKhovanov in [4]. Actually we give the version which they explained in Section 4.5 of [4] and\nwhich can be found in detail in [5].\nFix a positive integer n. The category SC 1 is the category whose objects are finite length\nsequences of points on the real line, where each point is colored by an integer between 1 and n.\nWe read sequences of points from left to right. Two colors i and j are called adjacent if |i\u2212j| = 1\nand distant if |i \u2212 j| > 1. The morphisms of SC 1 are given by generators modulo relations. A\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPEDRO VAZ\n\nmorphism of SC 1 is a C-linear combination of planar diagrams constructed by horizontal and\nvertical gluings of the following generators (by convention no label means a generic color j):\n\u2022 Generators involving only one color:\n\nEndDot\n\nMerge\n\nStartDot\n\nSplit\n\nIt is useful to define the cap and cup as\n\u2261\n\n\u2261\n\n\u2022 Generators involving two colors:\n\u2013 The 4-valent vertex, with distant colors,\n\nj\n\ni\n\n\u2013 and the 6-valent vertex, with adjacent colors i and j\n.\ni\n\nj\n\nj\n\ni\n\nread from bottom to top. In this setting a diagram represents a morphism from the bottom\nboundary to the top. We can add a new colored point to a sequence and this endows SC 1 with a\nmonoidal structure on objects, which is extended to morphisms in the obvious way. Composition\nof morphisms consists of stacking one diagram on top of the other.\nWe consider our diagrams modulo the following relations.\n\"Isotopy\" relations:\n(1)\n\n=\n\n=\n\n(2)\n\n=\n\n=\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\n=\n\n\fTHE DIAGRAMMATIC SOERGEL CATEGORY AND sl(2) AND sl(3) FOAMS\n\n(4)\n\n=\n\n=\n\n(5)\n\n=\n\n=\n\n3\n\nThe relations are presented in terms of diagrams with generic colorings. Because of isotopy\ninvariance, one may draw a diagram with a boundary on the side, and view it as a morphism in\nSC 1 by either bending the line up or down. By the same reasoning, a horizontal line corresponds\nto a sequence of cups and caps.\nOne color relations:\n\n=\n\n(6)\n\n= 0\n\n(7)\n\n+\n\n(8)\n\n= 2\n\nTwo distant colors:\n\n(9)\n\n=\n\n(10)\n\n=\n\n(11)\n\n=\n\nTwo adjacent colors:\n(12)\n\n=\n\n+\n\n\f4\n\nPEDRO VAZ\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n=\n\n(15)\n\n1\n=\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n!\n\nRelations involving three colors: (adjacency is determined by the vertices which appear)\n(16)\n\n=\n\n(17)\n\n=\n\n(18)\n\n=\n\nIntroduce a q-grading on SC 1 declaring that dots have degree 1, trivalent vertices have degree\n\u22121 and 4- and 6-valent vertices have degree 0.\nDefinition 2.1. The category SC 2 is the category containing all direct sums and grading shifts of\nobjects in SC 1 and whose morphisms are the grading preserving morphisms from SC 1 .\nDefinition 2.2. The category SC is the Karoubi envelope of the category SC 2 .\nElias and Khovanov's main result in [4] is the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.3 (Elias-Khovanov). The category SC is equivalent to the Soergel category in [11].\nFrom Soergel's results from [11] we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 2.4. The Grothendieck algebra of SC is isomorphic to the Hecke algebra.\n\n\fTHE DIAGRAMMATIC SOERGEL CATEGORY AND sl(2) AND sl(3) FOAMS\n\n5\n\nNotice that SC is an additive category but not abelian and we are using the (additive) split\nGrothendieck algebra.\nIn Sections 3 and 4 we will define functors from SC 1 to the categories of sl(2) and sl(3)\nfoams. These functors are grading preserving, so they obviously extend uniquely to SC 2 . By the\nuniversality of the Karoubi envelope, they also extend uniquely to functors between the respective\nKaroubi envelopes.\n3. T HE sl(2) CASE\n3.1. Clark-Morrison-Walker's category of disoriented sl(2) foams. In this subsection we\nreview the category Foam2 of sl(2) foams following Clark, Morrison and Walker's construction\nin [2]. This category was introduced in [2] to modify Khovanov's link homology theory making\nit properly functorial with respect to link cobordisms. Actually we will use the version with dots\nof Clark-Morrison-Walker's original construction in [2]. Recall that we obtain one from the other\nby replacing each dot by 1/2 times a handle.\nA disoriented arc is an arc composed by oriented segments with oppositely oriented segments\nseparated by a mark pointing to one of these segments. A disoriented diagram consists of a\ncollection D of disoriented arcs in the strip in R2 bounded by the lines y = 0, 1 containing the\nboundary points of D. We allow diagrams containing oriented and disoriented circles. Disoriented diagrams can be composed vertically which endows Foam2 with a monoidal structure on\nobjects. For example, the diagrams 1n and uj for (1 < j < n) are disoriented diagrams:\n***\n\n1n =\n1\n\n2\n\n***\n\nuj =\nn\n\n***\nj\n\n1\n\nj+1\n\nn\n\nA disoriented cobordism between disoriented diagrams is a 2d cobordism which can be decorated with dots and with seams separating differently oriented regions and such that the vertical\nboundary of each cobordism is a set (possibly empty) of vertical lines. Disorientation seams can\nhave one out of two possible orientations which we identify with a fringe. We read cobordisms\nfrom bottom to top. For example,\n\n***\n\n1\n\n***\n\nj\n\nn\n\nis a disoriented cobordism from 1n to uj .\nCobordism composition consists of placing one cobordism on top of the other and the monoidal\nstructure is given by vertical composition which corresponds to placing one cobordism behind\nthe other in our pictures. Let C[t] be the ring of polynomials in t with coefficients in C.\nDefinition 3.1. The category Foam2 is the category whose objects are disoriented diagrams,\nand whose morphisms are C[t]-linear combinations of isotopy classes of disoriented cobordisms,\nmodulo some relations,\n\n\f6\n\nPEDRO VAZ\n\n\u2022 the disorientation relations\n(19)\n\n= \u2212i\n\n= i\n\n= \u2212i\n\n(20)\n\n= \u2212\n\n(21)\nwhere i is the imaginary unit,\n\u2022 and the Bar-Natan (BN) relations,\n\n= t\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\n= 0\n\n=\n\n= 1\n\n+\n\nwhich are only valid away from the disorientations.\nThe universal theory for the original Khovanov homology contains another parameter h, but\nwe have to put h = 0 in the Clark-Morrison-Walker's cobordism theory over a field of characteristic zero. For suppose we have a cylinder with a transversal disoriented circle. Applying (24) on\none side of the disorientation circle followed by the disoriented relation (19) gives a cobordism\nthat is independent of the side chosen to apply (24) only if h = 0 over a field of characteristic\nzero.\nDefine a q-grading on C[t] by q(1) = 0 and q(t) = 4. We introduce a q-grading on Foam2 as\nfollows. Let f be a cobordism with |\u2022| dots and |b| vertical boundary components. The q-grading\nof f is given by\n(25)\n\nq(f ) = \u2212\u03c7(f ) + 2| \u2022 | + 12 |b|\n\nwhere \u03c7 is the Euler characteristic. For example the degree of a saddle is 1 while the degree of a\ncap or a cup is \u22121. The category Foam2 is additive and monoidal. More details about Foam2\ncan be found in [2].\n3.2. The functor Fsl(2),n . In this subsection we define a monoidal functor Fsl(2),n between the\ncategories SC and Foam2 .\nOn objects: Fsl(2),n sends the empty sequence to 1n and the one-term sequence (j) to uj with\nFsl(2),n (jk) given by the vertical composite uj uk .\nOn morphisms:\n\n\fTHE DIAGRAMMATIC SOERGEL CATEGORY AND sl(2) AND sl(3) FOAMS\n\n7\n\n\u2022 The empty diagram is sent to n parallel vertical sheets:\n\n***\n\n\u2205 7\u2212\u2192\n1\n\nn\n\nn\u22121\n\n2\n\n\u2022 The vertical line colored j is sent to the identity cobordism of uj :\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\nThe remaining n \u2212 2 vertical parallel sheets on the r.h.s. are not shown for simplicity, a\nconvention that we will follow from now on.\n\u2022 The StartDot and EndDot morphisms are sent to saddle cobordisms:\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\n\u2022 Merge and Split are sent to cup and cap cobordisms:\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\n\u2022 The 4-valent vertex with distant colors. For j + 1 < k we have:\n\n7\u2212\u2192\nk\n\nj\nj\n\nj + 1 *** k\n\nk+1\n\nThe case j > k + 1 is given by reflection in a horizontal plane.\n\n\f8\n\nPEDRO VAZ\n\n\u2022 The 6-valent vertices are sent to zero:\n\n7\u2212\u2192 0\n\nNotice that Fsl(2),n respects the gradings of the morphisms. Taking the quotient of SC by the\n6-valent vertex gives a diagrammatic category T L categorifying the Temperley-Lieb algebra.\nAccording to [3] relations (12) and (13) can be replaced by a single relation in T L. The functor\nFsl(2),n descends to a functor between T L and Foam2 .\nProposition 3.2. Fsl(2),n is a monoidal functor.\nProof. The assignment given by Fsl(2),n clearly respects the monoidal structures of SC 1 and\nFoam2 . So we only need to show that Fsl(2),n is a functor, i.e. it respects the relations (1)\nto (18) of Section 2.\n\"Isotopy relations\": Relations (1) to (4) are straightforward to check and correspond to isotopies\nof their images under Fsl(2),n which respect the disorientations. Relation (5) is automatic since\nFsl(2),n send all terms to zero. For the sake of completeness we show the first equality in (1). We\nhave\n\nFsl(2),n\n\n!\n\nj\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n=\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\n= Fsl(2),n\n\nj\n\nOne color relations: For relation (6) we have\n!\n\u223c Fsl(2),n\nFsl(2),n\n=\n\nj\n\n!\n\nj+1\n\n!\n\n\u223c\n= Fsl(2),n\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere the first equivalence follows from relations (1) and (3) and the second from isotopy of the\ncobordisms involved.\nFor relation (7) we have\n\nFsl(2),n\n\nj\n\n!\n\n=\n\n= 0\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\nby relations (19) and (23).\n\n\fTHE DIAGRAMMATIC SOERGEL CATEGORY AND sl(2) AND sl(3) FOAMS\n\n9\n\nRelation (8) requires some more work. We have\n\nj\n\nFsl(2),n\nj\n\n!\n\n= \u2212i\n\n=\n\nj\n\nj j+1\n\nj+1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n= \u2212i \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n+\n\nj j+1\n\nj j+1\n\nwhere the second equality follows from the disoriented relation (20) and the third from the BN\nrelation (24).

In this subsection we review the category Foam3\nof sl(3)-foams introduced by the author and Mackaay in [8]. This category was introduced to\nuniversally deform Khovanov's construction in [7] leading to the sl(3)-link homology theory.\nWe follow the conventions and notation of [8]. Recall that a web is a trivalent planar graph,\nwhere near each vertex all edges are oriented away from it or all edges are oriented towards\nit. We also allow webs without vertices, which are oriented loops. A pre-foam is a cobordism\nwith singular arcs between two webs. A singular arc in a pre-foam f is the set of points of f\nwhich have a neighborhood homeomorphic to the letter Y times an interval. Singular arcs are\ndisjoint. Interpreted as morphisms, we read pre-foams from bottom to top by convention, foam\ncomposition consists of placing one pre-foam on top of the other. The orientation of the singular\narcs is by convention as in the zip and the unzip,\n,\n\nand\n\nrespectively. Pre-foams can have dots which can move freely on the facet to which they belong\nbut are not allowed to cross singular arcs. A foam is an isotopy class of pre-foams. Let C[a, b, c]\nbe the ring of polynomials in a, b, c with coefficients in C.\nWe impose the set of relations l = (3D, CN, S, \u0398) on foams, as well as the closure relation,\nwhich are explained below.\n=a\n\n(3D)\n\n(CN)\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+b\n\n\u2212\n\n+c\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n+ a\uf8ed\n\n+\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8+b\n\n\fTHE DIAGRAMMATIC SOERGEL CATEGORY AND sl(2) AND sl(3) FOAMS\n\n=\n\n(S)\n\n(\u0398)\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b4\n\n13\n\n= \u22121\n\n= 0,\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4) = (1, 2, 0) or a cyclic permutation\n= \u22121 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4) = (2, 1, 0) or a cyclic permutation\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0 else\n\nThe closure relation says that any C[a, b, c]-linear combination of foams, all of which have\nthe same boundary, is equal to zero if and only if any common way of closing these foams yields\na C[a, b, c]-linear combination of closed foams whose evaluation is zero.\nUsing the relations l one can prove the identities below (for detailed proofs see [8]).\n(Bamboo)\n\n=\u2212\n\n(RD)\n\n=\n\n(Bubble)\n\n= 0\n\n(DR)\n\n=\n\n(SqR)\n\n=\u2212\n\n(Dot Migration)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n= \u2212b\n\n=\n\na\n\nc\n\n\f14\n\nPEDRO VAZ\n\nIn this paper we will work with open webs and open foams.\nDefinition 4.1. Foam3 is the category whose objects are webs \u0393 inside a horizontal strip in\nR2 bounded by the lines y = 0, 1 containing the boundary points of \u0393 and whose morphisms\nare C[a, b, c]-linear combinations of foams inside that strip times the unit interval such that the\nvertical boundary of each foam is a set (possibly empty) of vertical lines.\nFor example, the diagrams 1n and vj are objects of Foam3 :\n1n =\n\nvj =\n\n***\n1\n\n2\n\nn\n\n***\n\n***\nj\n\n1\n\nj+1\n\nn\n\nThe category Foam3 is additive and monoidal, with the monoidal structure given as in Foam2 .\nThe category Foam3 is also additive and graded. The q-grading in C[a, b, c] is defined as\nq(1) = 0,\n\nq(a) = 2,\n\nq(b) = 4,\n\nq(c) = 6\n\nand the degree of a foam f with | \u2022 | dots and |b| vertical boundary components is given by\nq(f ) = \u22122\u03c7(f ) + \u03c7(\u2202f ) + 2| \u2022 | + |b|,\nwhere \u03c7 denotes the Euler characteristic and \u2202f is the boundary of f .\n4.2.

In this subsection we define a monoidal functor Fsl(3),n between the\ncategories SC and Foam3 .\nOn objects: Fsl(3),n sends the empty sequence to 1n and the one-term sequence (j) to vj with\nFsl(3),n (jk) given by the vertical composite vj vk .\nOn morphisms:\n\u2022 As before the empty diagram is sent to n parallel vertical sheets:\n\n***\n\n\u2205 7\u2212\u2192\n1\n\nn\u22121\n\n2\n\nn\n\n\u2022 The vertical line colored j is sent to the identity foam of vj :\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\n\fTHE DIAGRAMMATIC SOERGEL CATEGORY AND sl(2) AND sl(3) FOAMS\n\n15\n\n\u2022 The StartDot and EndDot morphisms are sent to the zip and the unzip respectively:\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\n\u2022 Merge and Split are sent to the digon creation and annihilation respectively:\n\nj\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj+1\n\nj+1\n\n\u2022 The 4-valent vertex with distant colors.

Fsl(3),n is a monoidal functor.\nProof. The assignement given by Fsl(3),n clearly respects the monoidal structures of SC 1 and\nFoam3 .
