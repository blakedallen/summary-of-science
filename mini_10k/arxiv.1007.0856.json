In the decaying X-ray tail\nof two such events, SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20, a number\nof long-lasting, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been observed (see Israel et al. (2005) and Watts & Strohmayer (2007) for\nrecent reviews). Early models interpreted the observed QPO frequencies as directly related to torsional shear oscillations of the\nsolid crust of a neutron star excited during a giant flare event (see\nDuncan (1998); Strohmayer & Watts (2005); Piro (2005); Sotani\net al. (2007); Samuelsson & Andersson (2007), and references\ntherein) raising hopes that through their identification, the physical properties of the crust could be probed (Steiner & Watts 2009).\nDue to the extremely strong magnetic fields present in magnetars,\nhowever, a self-consistent model that includes global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations interacting with the shear oscillations of the crust is required (Levin (2006), Glampedakis & Andersson (2006), Levin (2007), Lee (2007, 2008)). In a highly simplified model, Levin (2007) showed that shear oscillations will be\nabsorbed by an MHD continuum of Alfv\u00e9n oscillations, while longlived QPOs may still appear at the turning points or edges of the\ncontinuum.\n\nSotani et al. (2008b) and subsequently Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al.\n(2009) (see also Colaiuda et al. (2009)), using a more realistic, general-relativistic MHD model but still ignoring an extended\ncrust, found two families of Alfv\u00e9n QPOs related to turning points\nof the frequency of torsional Alfv\u00e9n waves near the magnetic pole\nand inside a region of closed magnetic field lines near the equator. Each QPO family consists of two sub-families differing by\ntheir symmetry behaviour with respect to the equatorial plane. The\nresults of the numerical simulations were explained by a semianalytic model based on standing waves in the short-wavelength\nlimit (Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. 2009). The Alfv\u00e9n QPO model is very\nattractive, because it reproduces the near-integer-ratios of the observed 30, 92 and 150 Hz frequencies in SGR 1806-20, at magnetic\nfield strengths expected for magnetars. In this model, the observed\nSGR QPOs, rather than probing the crust, yield information on the\nmagnetic field and the compactness of the star.\nThe omission of an extended crust in the previous studies of\nSotani et al. (2008b), Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009), and Colaiuda et al.\n(2009) can be considered as a limiting case of a very strong magnetic field. For intermediate magnetic field strengths, however, an\nunderstanding of magnetar oscillations requires the inclusion of\ncrust-core coupling. In this Letter, we present the first such realistic simulations of coupled, magneto-elastic oscillations. We use a\ngeneral-relativistic framework, a dipolar magnetic field, and a tabu-\n\n\f2\n\nMichael Gabler, Pablo Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 A. Font, Ewald M\u00fcller and Nikolaos Stergioulas\n\nlated equation of state (EOS) for dense matter. The numerical simulations are based on state-of-the-art Riemann solver methods for\nboth the interior MHD fluid and the crust. A recent study by van\nHoven & Levin (2010) also takes entanglement of magnetic field\nlines into account, thereby generalising the toy model of Levin\n(2007). Some first results on coupled crust-core oscillations also\nappeared in Kokkotas et al. (2010).\nWe use units where c = G = 1 with c and G being the speed\nof light and the gravitational constant, respectively. Latin (Greek)\nindices run from 1 to 3 (0 to 3).\n2\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe present study of torsional oscillations of magnetars is based on\na numerical integration of the general relativistic MHD equations.\nAs in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009), who considered purely Alfv\u00e9n\noscillations of the fluid core, assume (i) a zero temperature EOS,\n(ii) axisymmetry, (iii) a purely poloidal magnetic field configuration, (iv) the Cowling approximation, (v) a spherically symmetric\nbackground, and (vi) small amplitude oscillations. Because of assumptions (ii) and (iii) polar oscillations decouple from axial ones\nin the linear regime. Therefore, we concentrate on purely axial oscillations and evolve the \u03c6-component of the evolution variables\nonly. We assume a conformally flat metric 1\nds2 = \u2212\u03b12 dt2 + \u03c64 dr2 + r2 d\u03b82 + r2 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\n\n\u0001\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the lapse function and \u03c6 the conformal factor, and consider a stress-energy tensor T \u03bc\u03bd of the form\nT \u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n+ Tmag\n+ Telas\nTfluid\n\n=\n\n\u03c1hu\u03bc u\u03bd + P g \u03bc\u03bd + b2 u\u03bc u\u03bd +\n\n1 2 \u03bc\u03bd\nb g \u2212 b\u03bc b \u03bd\n2\n\n\u22122\u03bcS \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the rest-mass density, h the specific enthalpy, P the\nisotropic fluid pressure, u\u03bc the 4-velocity of the fluid, b\u03bc the magnetic field measured by a co-moving observer (with b2 := b\u03bc b\u03bc ),\n\u03a3\u03bc\u03bd the shear tensor, and \u03bcS the shear modulus. The latter is obtained according to Sotani et al. (2007).\nThe conservation of energy and momentum \u2207\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd = 0, and\nthe induction equation lead to the following system of evolution\nequations\n\u0012 \u221a\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u2202 \u03b3U\n\u2202 \u2212gFi\n1\n\u221a\n+\n= 0,\n(3)\n\u2202t\n\u2202xi\n\u2212g\nwhere g and \u03b3 are the determinants of the 4-metric and 3-metric,\nrespectively. The two-component state and flux vectors are given\nby\nU\n\n=\n\nFr\n\n=\n\nF\u03b8\n\n=\n\n[S\u03c6 , B \u03c6 ] ,\nh\ni\nb\u03c6 B r\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\u03bcS \u03a3r\u03c6 , \u2212v \u03c6 B r ,\nW\n\u0014\n\u0015\nb\u03c6 B \u03b8\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\u03bcS \u03a3\u03b8\u03c6 , \u2212v \u03c6 B \u03b8 ,\nW\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere B i are the magnetic field components as measured by an Eulerian observer (Ant\u00f3n et al. 2006), and W = \u03b1ut is the Lorentz\nfactor. The shear tensor \u03a3i\u03c6 = 1/2g ii \u03be \u03c6,i contains the spatial\nderivatives (denoted by a comma) of the fluid displacement \u03be \u03c6 due\n1\n\nThis provides a very good approximation as our neutron star models are\nalmost perfectly spherically symmetric except for very small deviations due\nto the presence of an axisymmetric magnetic field.\n\nto the oscillations, which are related to the fluid 4-velocity according to \u03be \u03c6,t = \u03b1v \u03c6 = u\u03c6 /ut , where v \u03c6 is the \u03c6-component of the\nfluid 3-velocity. Hence, the evolution of the spatial derivatives \u03be \u03c6,r\nand \u03be \u03c6,\u03b8 is given by\n(\u03be \u03c6,k ),t \u2212 (\u03b1v \u03c6 ),k = 0\n\nwith\n\nk \u2208 {r, \u03b8} .\n\n(7)\n\nWe also need to provide boundary conditions. At the surface\nthe radial derivative of the displacement has to vanish (\u03be \u03c6,r = 0),\nas we assume a continuous traction and vanishing surface currents.\nAt the crust-core interface we demand the continuity of the parallel electric field, which implies a continuous displacement \u03be \u03c6 .\nTogether with the continuity of the traction the latter leads to a relation between the radial derivatives of the displacement in the core\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nand in the crust: \u03becore,r\n= (1 + \u03b4) \u03becrust,r\nwith \u03b4 = \u03bcS /(br br ).\nTo construct equilibrium models we choose between different barotropic EOSs for the core that are matched to an EOS for\nthe crust. The available models for the core are the soft EOS A\n(Pandharipande 1971), the intermediate EOS WFF3 (Wiringa et al.\n1988), EOS APR (Akmal et al. 1998) and the stiff EOS L (Pandharipande & Smith 1975). For the low density region of the crust\nwe choose between EOS NV (Negele & Vautherin 1973) and EOS\nDH (Douchin & Haensel 2001). Details about the different combinations of EOSs can be found in Sotani et al. (2007). We use a reference model with a mass of 1.4 M and a circumferential radius\nRstar = 12.26 km, described by the APR + DH EOS. In contrast\nto Sotani et al. (2007) we compute magnetised equilibrium models\nusing the LORENE library (www.lorene.obspm.fr).\nOur simulation code is an extended version of the GRMHD\ncode presented in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009). It includes the shear\nterms as they appear in (2), and the evolution of the displacements\n(7). The proper working of the MHD part of the code was demonstrated in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2008). To test the extended code we\ncompared its results obtained for two limiting cases, zero magnetic\nfield and zero shear modulus, with those of previous studies. The\npurely crustal shear oscillations presented in Sotani et al. (2007) are\nrecovered with an agreement of 1%, and the Alfv\u00e9n continuum is\nobtained naturally as in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009). Further details\non the derivation of the model equations, the numerical methods,\nand the code tests will be discussed in Gabler, Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n, Font\n& Stergioulas (in preparation).\n3\n\nDAMPING OF CRUSTAL SHEAR MODES\n\nTo study the behaviour of coupled crust-core oscillations we perturb the equilibrium stellar model by imposing a velocity perturbation and then follow the time evolution of the system (3) - (7).\nUnless stated otherwise, we use a grid of 150\u00d7100 zones in our\nsimulations covering a domain [0, Rstar ] \u00d7 [0, \u03c0]. The angular grid\nis equidistant, while the radial grid is equidistant only in the crust,\nwhere 40 per cent of the zones are located, and coarsens towards\nthe centre of the star. Symmetries are exploited whenever a perturbation is of purely odd or even parity with respect to the equatorial\nplane. We use the term damping in the following to refer to resonant\nabsorption of crustal shear oscillations by the Alfv\u00e9n continuum of\nthe core (unless we explicitly refer to numerical damping caused\nby finite-differencing).\nWe investigated perturbations of different radial extent encompassing only the crust, only the core, or the whole star.

(2007)). Because the eigenmodes of the crust\nform a complete orthonormal set we can expand any perturbation\nin terms of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The expansion factors, which provide a measure of how strong each crustal mode\ncontributes to the perturbation, are obtained via the overlap integrals with the eigenfunctions. For more details on this method see\nGabler et al. (2009). In the left panel of Fig. 1 we show the maximum (absolute) amplitudes of the overlap integrals for different\ninitial perturbations and for simulations both without magnetic field\n(solid lines) and with a polar magnetic field of 5 \u00d7 1013 G (dots) .\nIn the field-free case the lines represent the numerical damping of\ncrustal modes due to finite-differencing. When a magnetic field is\npresent, the damping (now due to resonant absorption) increases\nwith the magnetic field strength.\nFor all modes, the timescale of resonant absorption is much\nshorter than that of numerical damping (see Table 1). After about\n500 ms, the overlap integrals no longer sample the crust oscillations, but instead the magneto-elastic oscillations which then dominate the evolution (see below).\nThe middle and right panels of Fig. 1 show the overlap integrals for l = 2 and l = 9 modes of the crust as a function of time\nfor different magnetic field strengths, respectively. For l = 2 and\nB = 5 \u00d7 1013 G we find almost complete damping of the crustal\nmode after \u223c 0.5 s. For a stronger magnetic field (B = 5\u00d71014 G)\nthe crustal mode becomes already damped after less than one oscillation, and only the dominant magneto-elastic oscillations remain.\nSimilar statements hold for the evolution of the l = 9 perturbation.\nHowever, in that case it takes a few oscillations before the crustal\nmode is damped, even for B = 5 \u00d7 1014 G.\nWe also analysed a more general initial perturbation consisting of a mixture of l = 2 up to l = 10 modes, which excites a\nlarge number of crustal modes of different angular order l and ra-\n\n\u03c4 [ms] at B = 1014 G\nn = 0, l = 2\nn = 0, l = 3\nn = 0, l = 9\n\nEOS\nA+DH 1.6\nA+NV 1.6\nAPR+DH 2.0\nAPR+NV 2.0\nL+DH 1.6\nL+NV 1.6\nL+DH 2.0\nL+NV 2.0\nW+DH 1.6\nW+NV 1.6\n\n23\n39\n32\n50\n50\n79\n44\n73\n29\n53\n\n23\n43\n31\n54\n52\n86\n46\n80\n30\n58\n\n15\n75\n17\n80\n24\n53\n21\n87\n14\n69\n\nTable 2.

Spatial distribution of Fourier amplitudes at several QPO frequencies. Three different types of QPOs are present: (i) upper QPOs in panels a, d, f, g,\ni, and k; (ii) lower QPOs in panels b and e; (iii) edge QPOs in panels c, h, j, and l. The two black dashed lines mark the location of the crust, while the blue\nlines represent magnetic field lines. The colour scale ranges from zero amplitude (white) to maximum amplitude (black).\n\novertones survive for a longer time. In the long run, a low frequency\n(\u223c 0.3 Hz) magneto-elastic oscillation dominates. At the largest\nmagnetic field strength shown here, 5 \u00d7 1014 G, there is no sign\nof either low or high frequency crustal modes, the evolution being\ncompletely dominated by magneto-elastic oscillations.\nDamping timescales of n = 0, l = {2, 3, 9} modes for different EOSs are listed in Table 2. For all EOSs and masses studied here, we find significant damping of the crustal shear modes at\nB = 1014 G. Up to the highest-order l = 9 mode, the damping\ntimescales are shorter than 0.1s. From the results in Tables 1 and\n2, we deduce that even at B = 5 \u00d7 1013 G, which is up to two orders of magnitude weaker than assumed magnetar field strengths,\nthe damping timescale is shorter than 0.2s, which is more than two\norders of magnitude shorter than the duration of observed QPOs.\n4\n\nthe region of closed magnetic field lines inside the core. The upper\nQPOs are influenced by the presence of the crust in several ways.\nFirst, they are limited to the fluid region, and become vanishingly\nsmall at the base of the crust (Fig. 3, panels a, d, f, g, i, and k), where\nthey are reflected. This behaviour is similar to that caused by the\nboundary conditions in Sotani et al. (2008b), and differs from that\nof the pure fluid case considered in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009). In\nthe latter work the continuous traction boundary condition imposed\nat the surface of the star resulted in a strong displacement there.\nTheir different behaviour at the base of the crust (w.r.t. the pure\nfluid case in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009)) causes a rearrangement of\nthe QPOs. Here, the lowest frequency QPO (panel a) is symmetric\nw.r.t. the equatorial plane (even parity) - while it did not exist at all\nin Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009) - and the lowest-frequency QPO has\nodd parity.\n\nLONG-TERM QPOS\n\nBesides the damping of crustal modes, we observe long-lasting oscillations in the fluid core of the magnetar. These long-term QPOs\nare identified by local maxima in Fourier space. Let us consider\nan intermediate magnetic field strength of 4 \u00d7 1014 G, where both\nthe magnetic field and the crust influence the dynamics. As in the\ncase without crust (Sotani et al. 2008b; Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. 2009)\nwe find two different families of long-term QPOs, as demonstrated\nin Fig. 3, which shows the spatial distribution of Fourier amplitudes\n(\u00b1)\nat several QPO frequencies. The lower QPOs (Ln ) are located in(\u00b1)\nside the region of closed field lines, while the upper QPOs (Un )\nconcentrate along open magnetic field lines closer to the poles. We\ncomputed QPOs of either odd (\u2212) or even (+) parity w.r.t. the\nequatorial plane, which allows for a better identification of QPOs\nof similar frequency but opposite parity.\nThe lower QPOs (Fig. 3, panels b and e) appear to be similar to\nthose found for models without crust, except that they are limited to\n\nWhile QPOs are located close to the symmetry axis of the field\n(polar axis) in models without crust (Sotani et al. 2008b; Cerd\u00e1Dur\u00e1n et al. 2009), they are attached to field lines crossing the\nequator at around 4 km in our models including the crust. Apparently the strong coupling introduced by the crust complicates the\noscillatory behaviour of the field lines, such that the interaction between neighbouring polar field lines prevents the QPOs from being\nestablished.\n\nFurthermore, we find a new family of QPOs (Fig. 3, panels c,\nh, j, and l) connected to the last open field line of the fluid core,\neach member representing the lower-frequency edge of an Alfv\u00e9n\ncontinuum along the open field lines. QPOs at similar locations\nwere also identified in simulations by Colaiuda et al. (2009) without\na crust.\n\n\fMagneto-elastic oscillations and the damping of crustal shear modes in magnetars\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this Letter we have presented the first numerical simulations of\naxisymmetric, torsional, magneto-elastic oscillations in a realistic\nmagnetar model, including an extended crust.\nWe focus on the timescales for resonant absorption of low\nfrequency, n = 0 crustal shear modes by the Alfv\u00e9n continuum\nof the core and find that even at B = 5 \u00d7 1013 G, which is up\nto two orders of magnitude weaker than assumed magnetar field\nstrengths, the damping timescale is shorter than 0.2s, which is more\nthan two orders of magnitude shorter than the duration of observed\nQPOs. Furthermore, the crust EOSs NV and DH which we have\nused have a very high shear modulus, compared to a range of other\nproposed EOSs (Steiner & Watts 2009). Comparing the damping\ntimescales obtained here for the NV and DH EOSs, we find that,\nat a given magnetic field strength, a lower shear modulus results\nin a shorter damping timescale due to resonant absorption. Thus,\nfor lower values of the shear modulus than considered here, the deduced damping timescales would be even shorter than our current\nfindings. In addition, no significant excitation of crustal modes by\nthe Alfv\u00e9n continuum was observed at the end of our simulations,\nwhich reached up to several seconds. The above results do not leave\nmuch room for shear modes of the crust to be able to sustain oscillations that lead to significant modulations in the X-ray tail of giant\nSGR bursts lasting for several tens of seconds, when the magnetic\nfield is global. The case of magnetic field configurations confined\nto the crust, which may be realised if the core is a type I superconductor, requires further investigation.\nIn contrast to the shear modes, the Alfv\u00e9n QPO model (see\nLevin (2007); Sotani et al. (2008b); Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009); Colaiuda et al. (2009)) has several attractive features, matching to observed frequencies for a dipole field strength up to several times\n1015 G and explaining the observed integer ratios for the frequencies of QPOs. Here we find that for magnetic field strengths less\nthan about 1015 G, the Alfv\u00e9n QPOs are mostly confined to the\nfluid core. For EOSs with a smaller shear modulus, this could reduce to several times 1014 G. Above this minimum field strength,\nAlfv\u00e9n oscillations completely dominate in the crust and the resulting QPOs have a maximum amplitude at the surface of the star.\nIt is thus likely, that the Alfv\u00e9n QPO model can operate efficiently\nonly above such a minimum field strength. In that case, the possible\nstrength of magnetar magnetic fields is limited to a narrow range,\nbetween the minimum strength discussed here and the upper bound\ndetermined in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n et al. (2009). Furthermore, the empirical formulas for the QPO frequencies presented in Cerd\u00e1-Dur\u00e1n\net al. (2009) could be used to directly constrain the strength of the\nmagnetic field and the compactness of the star.\nA more extended investigation of the minimum magnetic field\nstrength for the Alfv\u00e9n QPO model will appear in Gabler et al.\n(2010). We are also planning to extend our model by taking into\naccount additional effects, such as different magnetic field topologies (see also Sotani et al. (2008a)), the coupling of the interior\ndynamics to an external magnetosphere, and the effect of field-line\nentanglement in the core.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments\nwhich helped to improve the final version of this letter.
