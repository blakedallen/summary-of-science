Dp-minimality-see Definition 2.2-was introduced\nby Shelah in [14] as possibly the strongest of a family of notions implying that a\ntheory does not have the independence property-for which see [15]. The study of dpminimality beyond Shelah's original work was continued by Onshuus and Usvyatsov\nin [11] focusing primarily on the stable case and by the second author in [9] primarily\nin the case of theories expanding the theory of divisible ordered Abelian groups. Our\ngoal in this paper is to provide many basic foundational facts on dp-minimality as well\nas to explore concrete examples of dp-minimality in the ordered context as well as the\nvalued field context. Much of our motivation arises out of the program of attempting\nto explore the impact of abstract model theoretic notions, such as dp-minimality, in\nconcrete situations such as ordered model theory on the reals or the study of valued\nfields. As such this note may be seen as providing some ground work for further study\nin this direction-for example Pierre Simon [16] has recently shown that an infinite\ndefinable subset of a dp-minimal divisible ordered Abelian group must have interior.\nWe give a brief outline of the content of our note. Section 2 is dedicated to definitions and providing several relevant background facts on dp-minimality. Many of\nDate: September 10, 2018.\nA portion of this paper was completed during the program \"Stable Methods in Unstable Context\"\nat the Banff International Research Station. The authors thank BIRS for their hospitality.\nThe first author would like to thank the Fields Institute for their hospitality during the thematic\nprogram \"O-minimal Structures and Analytic Geometry\" during which a portion of this paper was\ncompleted.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\nthese facts are inherent in [14] but we isolate them here and provide straightforward\nproofs. Section 3 is a brief discussion of the relationship of dp-minimality to some\nother minimality notions. In Section 4 we focus weak on o-minimality-for which\nsee [10]-and show that a weakly o-minimal theory is dp-minimal as well providing\nan example of a weakly o-minimal group which is not obtained by expanding on\no-minimal structure by convex sets. Work in Section 3 as well as results from [9]\nindicate that a dp-minimal theory expanding that of divisible ordered Abelian groups\nhas some similarity to a weakly o-minimal theory and we may naturally ask whether\nany such theory is weakly o-minimal. Section 5 provides a negative answer via an example arising form the valued field context. Our final section is dedicated to showing\nthat the theory of the p-adic field is dp-minimal.\n2. basic facts on dp-minimality\nWe develop several basics facts about dp-minimality. The vast majority of the\nmaterial found below is inherent in Shelah's paper [14], but typically in the more\ngeneral context of strong dependence. We provide proofs of these various facts for\nclarity and ease of exposition. Recall:\nDefinition 2.1. Fix a structure M, An ICT pattern in M consists of a pair of formulae\n\u03c6(x, y) and \u03c8(x, y); and sequences {ai : i \u2208 \u03c9} and {bi : i \u2208 \u03c9} from M so that for\nall i, j \u2208 \u03c9 the following is consistent:\n^\n^\n\u03c6(x, ai ) \u2227 \u03c8(x, bj ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c6(x, al ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c8(x, bk ).\nl6=i\n\nk6=j\n\nRemark. Definition 2.1 should more formally be referred to as an ICT pattern of\ndepth two but in this paper we only consider such ICT patterns and thus we omit\nthis extra terminology.\nDefinition 2.2. A theory T is said to be dp-minimal if in no model M |= T is there\nan ICT pattern.\nIt is often very convenient to use the following definition and fact.\nDefinition 2.3. We say two sequences {ai : i \u2208 I} and {bj : j \u2208 J} are mutually\nS\nindiscernible if {ai : i \u2208 I} is indiscernible over j\u2208J bj and {bj : j \u2208 J} is indisS\ncernible over i\u2208I ai . We call an ICT pattern mutually indiscernible if the witnessing\nsequences are mutually indiscernible.\nFact 2.4. T is dp-minimal if and only if in no model M |= T is there a mutually\nindiscernible ICT pattern.\nProof. This is a simple application of compactness and Ramsey's theorem.\n\n\u0003\n\nBefore continuing we should mention another alternative characterization of dpminimality. To this end we have the following definition.\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n3\n\nDefinition 2.5. A theory T is said to be inp-minimal if there is no model of M of T\nformulae \u03c6(x, y) and \u03c8(x, y), natural numbers k0 and k1 , and sequences {ai : i \u2208 \u03c9}\nand {bi : i \u2208 \u03c9} so that {\u03c6(x, ai ) : i \u2208 \u03c9} is k0 -inconsistent, {\u03c8(x, bj ) : j \u2208 \u03c9} is\nk1 -inconsistent and for any i, j \u2208 \u03c9 the formula \u03c6(x, ai ) \u2227 \u03c8(x, bj ) is consistent.\nWith this definition we have the following fact:\nFact 2.6. [11, Lemma 2.11] If T does not have the independence property and is\ninp-minimal then T is dp-minimal.\nThe next fact is extremely useful in showing that a theory is not dp-minimal. It is\nkey in establishing the relationship between dp-minimality and indiscernible sequences\nthat follows.\nFact 2.7. Let T be a complete theory, we work in a monster model C. Suppose there\nare formulae \u03c60 (x, y) and \u03c61 (x, y) and mutually indiscernible sequences {ai : i \u2208 \u03c9}\nand {bi : i \u2208 \u03c9} so that\n\u03c60 (x, a0 ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c60 (x, a1 ) \u2227 \u03c61 (x, b0 ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c61 (x, b1 )\nis consistent then T is not dp-minimal.\nProof. By compactness there are mutually indiscernible sequences ai for i \u2208 Z and bi\nfor i \u2208 Z and c so that\n|= \u03c60 (c, a0 ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c60 (c, a1 ) \u2227 \u03c61 (c, b0 ), \u2227\u00ac\u03c61 (c, b1 ).\nBy applying compactness and Ramsey's theorem\nwe assume that {ai : i < 0} and\nS\n{ai : i > 1} are both indiscernible over i\u2208\u03c9 bi \u222a {c} as well as that {bi : i < 0}\nS\nand {bi : i > 1} are both indiscernible over i\u2208\u03c9 ai \u222a {c}. Let di = a\u2322\n2i a2i+1 and\n\u2322\nei = b2i b2i+1 for i \u2208 Z. Note that these two sequences are mutually indiscernible.\nLet \u03c80 (x, y 0 y 1 ) be \u03c60 (x, y 0 ) \u2194 \u00ac\u03c60 (x, y 1 ) and \u03c81 (x, y 0 y 1 ) be \u03c61 (x, y 0 ) \u2194 \u00ac\u03c61 (x, y 1 ).\nThen C |= \u03c80 (c, d0 ) \u2227 \u03c81 (c, e0 ) and if i 6= 0 then |= \u00ac\u03c80 (c, di ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c81 (c, ei ) by the\nindiscernibility assumptions. It follows that \u03c80 , \u03c81 , {di : i \u2208 \u03c9} and {ei : i \u2208 \u03c9}\nwitness that T is not dp-minimal.\n\u0003\nUsing the identical proof as above we show:\nFact 2.8. The following are equivalent:\n(1) There are formulae \u03c6i (x, y) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and sequences aij for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N\nand j \u2208 \u03c9 so that for every \u03b7 : {1, . . . , N} \u2192 \u03c9 the type:\n^ ^\n^\n\u00ac\u03c6i (x, aij )\n\u03c6i (x, ai\u03b7(i) ) \u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264N\n\nis consistent.\n\n1\u2264i\u2264N j6=\u03b7(i)\n\n\f4\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\n(2) There are formulae \u03c8i (x, y) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and mutually indiscernible sequences {aij : j \u2208 \u03c9} for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N so that the type:\n^\n^\n\u03c8i (x, ai0 ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c8i (x, ai1 )\n1\u2264i\u2264N\n\n1\u2264i\u2264N\n\nis consistent\nAs in the case of the independence property and strong dependence we have a\ncharacterization of dp-minimality in terms of splitting indiscernible sequences.\nFact 2.9. The following are equivalent for a theory T :\n(1) T is dp-minimal.\n(2) If {ai : i \u2208 I} is an indiscernible sequence and c is an element then there is a\npartition of I into finitely many convex sets I0 , . . . , In , at most two of which\nare infinite, so that for any 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n if i, j \u2208 Il then tp(ai /c) = tp(aj /c).\n(3) If {ai : i \u2208 I} is an indiscernible sequence and c is an element then there is a\npartition of I into finitely many convex sets I0 , . . . , In , at most two of which\nare infinite, so that for any 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n the sequence {ai : i \u2208 Il } is indiscernible\nover c.\nProof. (1) \u21d2 (3): Suppose T is dp-minimal and for contradiction suppose that there\nis an indiscernible sequence (which for notational simplicity we assume consists of\nsingletons) {ai : i \u2208 I} and an element c witnessing the failure of (3). Without loss\nof generality we assume that I is a sufficiently saturated dense linear order without\nendpoints. By [1, Corollary 6] there is an initial segment I0 \u2286 I and a final segment\nI1 \u2286 I so that the sequences {ai : i \u2208 I0 } and {ai : i \u2208 I1 } are indiscernible\nover c. We may choose I0 to be maximal in the sense that for no convex J with\nI0 \u2282 J \u2286 I is {aj : j \u2208 J} indiscernible over c and similarly for I1 . If I \\ (I0 \u222a I1 )\nis finite then (3) holds so I \\ (I0 \u222a I1 ) is infinite and thus contains an interval. Let\nJ0 and J1 be disjoint convex sets so that I0 \u2282 J0 \u2282 I and I1 \u2282 J1 \u2282 I. We find\nj1\u2217 < * * * < jn\u2217 \u2208 J0 and a formula \u03c6(x, y1 , . . . , yn ) so that \u00ac\u03c6(c, ai1 , . . . ain ) holds for\n\u2217 ) holds. We choose a sequence of n-tuples di\nall i1 < * * * < in \u2208 I0 but \u03c6(c, aj1\u2217 , . . . , ajm\nfor i \u2208 \u03c9 as follows: Let d0 = aj1\u2217 , . . . , ajn\u2217 , if i > 0 let di = ai1 , . . . , ain where i1 , . . . , in\nis any increasing sequence of elements with ik \u2208 I0 for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n and so that\nin < min{l \u2208 I : al \u2208 di\u22121 }. Note that {di : i \u2208 \u03c9} is indiscernible. Similarly we may\nfind kj\u22171 < * * * < kj\u2217m \u2208 J1 and a formula \u03c8(x, y1 , . . . , ym ) so that \u00ac\u03c8(c, ai1 , . . . , aim )\n\u2217 ) holds. We build a sequence of\nholds for all i1 < * * * < im \u2208 I1 but \u03c8(c, ak1\u2217 , . . . , akm\n\u2217 . For i > 0 let ei = ai , . . . , ai\nm-tuples {ei : i \u2208 \u03c9} as follows: e0 = ak1\u2217 , . . . , akm\nm\n1\nwhere i1 , . . . , im is any increasing sequence from I1 and i1 > max{l \u2208 I : al \u2208 ei\u22121 }.\nNotice that {di : i \u2208 \u03c9} and {ej : j \u2208 \u03c9} are mutually indiscernible sequences. Thus\nthe formulae \u03c6(x, y 1 , . . . , yn ) and \u03c8(x, y 1 , . . . , y m ) and the sequences di , ei for i \u2208 \u03c9\nform a configuration as found in Fact 2.7 and T is not dp-minimal.\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n5\n\n(3) \u21d2 (2): Immediate.\n(2) \u21d2 (1). For contradiction suppose there are formulae \u03c6(x, y) and \u03c8(x, y) and\nmutually indiscernible sequences {ai : i \u2208 3 \u00d7 \u03c9} and {bi : i \u2208 3 \u00d7 \u03c9} which witness\nthe failure of dp-minimality. Such sequences must exist by compactness. For i \u2208 3\u00d7\u03c9\nlet ci = a\u2322\ni bi . Note this is an indiscernible sequence. Pick d realizing the type:\n^\n^\n\u03c6(x, a\u03c9 ) \u2227 \u03c8(x, a2\u00d7\u03c9 ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c6(x, ai ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c8(x, bj ).\ni6=\u03c9\n\nj6=2\u00d7\u03c9\n\nIf i 6= \u03c9 or 2 \u00d7 \u03c9 then |= \u00ac\u03c6(d, ai ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8(d, bi ), if i = \u03c9 then |= \u03c6(d, a\u03c9 ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8(d, b\u03c9 ) and\nif i = 2 \u00d7 \u03c9 then |= \u00ac\u03c6(d, a2\u00d7\u03c9 ) \u2227 \u03c8(d, b2\u00d7\u03c9 ). It follows that the indiscernible sequence\n{ci : i \u2208 3 \u00d7 \u03c9} can not be decomposed into convex subsets of which at most two are\ninfinite so that the type over d is constant on each convex set. Hence (2) fails.\n\u0003\nWe use the preceding fact to provide a characterization of dp-minimality which\nallows us to consider formulae with more than one free variable in a variant of Definition 2.2 as well as to consider sets of parameters of arbitrary size in a variant of\nFact 2.9. The proof is immediate using Facts 2.8 and 2.9.\nFact 2.10. For any theory T the following are equivalent.\n(1) T is dp-minimal.\n(2) If {ai : i \u2208 I} is an indiscernible sequence and c is an n-tuple from the universe\nthen there is a partition of I into convex sets I1 , . . . , Il of which at most 2n\nare infinite so that if 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n and i, j \u2208 Il then tp(ai /c) = tp(aj /c).\n(3) If {ai : i \u2208 I} is an indiscernible sequence and c is an n-tuple from the universe\nthen there is a partition of I into convex sets I1 , . . . , Il of which at most 2n\nare infinite so that if 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n the sequence {ai : i \u2208 Il } is indiscernible.\n(4) There is no sequence of formulae \u03c61 (x, y), . . . , \u03c62n (x, y) with |x| = n and sequences {aji : i \u2208 \u03c9} with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2n so that form any \u03b7 : {1, . . . , 2n } \u2192 \u03c9 the\ntype\n^\n^\n^\n\u03c6k (x, ak\u03b7(k) ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c6k (x, akt )\n1\u2264k\u22642n\n\n1\u2264k\u22642n {t\u2208\u03c9:\u03b7(k)6=t}\n\nis consistent.\nGiven a dp-minimal theory T it is reasonable to ask if the bound in Fact 2.10(4)\nmay be improved from 2n to n + 1. This holds in the stable case and we sketch the\nproof.\nFact 2.11. If T is dp-minimal and stable then there is no sequence of formulae\n\u03c61 (x, y), . . . , \u03c6n+1(x, y)\n\n\f6\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\nwith |x| = n and sequences {aji : i \u2208 \u03c9} with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n so that for any \u03b7 :\n{1, . . . , n + 1} \u2192 \u03c9 the type\n^\n^\n^\n\u03c6k (x, ak\u03b7(k) ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c6k (x, akt )\n1\u2264k\u2264n+1\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n {t\u2208\u03c9:\u03b7(k)6=t}\n\nis consistent.\nProof. (Sketch) By [11, Theorem 3.5] T is stable and dp-minimal if and only if every\n1-type has weight 1. Thus if T is stable and dp-minimal every n-type has weight at\nmost n. Apply [11, Lemma 2.3 and Lemma 2.11] and the result follows.\n\u0003\nThis fact also holds for weakly o-minimal T (we defer discussion of this to section 3).\nIn fact it is tempting to restate the result with stable replaced by rosy and use \u00feweight as in [12] but at the moment it is not clear if the result follows. Overall we do\nnot know whether these improved bounds hold for a general dp-minimal theory.\nWe finish with two facts which are useful in studying specific examples. The first\nof these is particularly useful when studying theories which admit some type of cell\ndecomposition-viz. the p-adics.\nFact 2.12. Suppose that \u03c6(x, y) and \u03c8(x, y) are formulae witnessing that a theory T\nis not dp-minimal. Further suppose that \u03c6(x, y) is \u03c61 (x, y) \u2228 * * * \u2228 \u03c6n (x, y). Then for\nsome 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n \u03c6l (x, y) and \u03c8(x, y) witness that T is not dp-minimal.\nProof. There are mutually indiscernible sequences {ai : i \u2208 Z} and bi : i \u2208 Z} so that\nfor any i\u2217 , j \u2217 \u2208 Z the type\n^\n^\n\u00ac\u03c6(x, ai ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c8(x, bj )\n\u03c6(x, ai\u2217 ) \u2227 \u03c8(x, bj \u2217 ) \u2227\ni6=i\u2217\n\nj6=j \u2217\n\nis consistent. For each i\u2217 \u2208 Z there is l(i\u2217 ) \u2208 {1, . . . , n} so that\n^\n^\n\u00ac\u03c6(x, ai ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c8(x, bj )\n\u03c6l(i\u2217 ) (x, ai\u2217 ) \u2227 \u03c8(x, b0 ) \u2227\ni6=i\u2217\n\nj6=j \u2217\n\nis consistent. Thus for some infinite I \u2286 Z and 1 \u2264 l\u2217 \u2264 n if i \u2208 I then l(i) = l\u2217 . It\nfollows that the formulae \u03c6l\u2217 (x, y) and \u03c8(x, y) together with the sequences {ai : i \u2208 I}\nand {bi : i \u2208 Z} witness that T is not dp-minimal.\n\u0003\nOur final fact shows that a counterexample to dp-minimality may always be found\nwhich uses only a single formula rather than two as in Definition 2.2.\nFact 2.13. Suppose that T is not dp-minimal. Then there is a formula \u03b8(x, y) and\nsequences {ci : i \u2208 \u03c9} and {di : i \u2208 \u03c9} so that for any i 6= j the type\n^\n^\n\u00ac\u03b8(x, ck ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03b8(x, dl )\n\u03b8(x, ci ) \u2227 \u03b8(x, dj ) \u2227\nk6=i\n\nis consistent.\n\nl6=j\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n7\n\nProof. Suppose that the formulae \u03c6(x, y) and \u03c8(x, y) and the sequences {ai : i \u2208\n\u03c9 + \u03c9} and {bj : j \u2208 \u03c9 + \u03c9} witness that T is not dp-minimal. Let \u03b8(x, y 1 , y 2 ) be\n\u03c6(x, y 1 ) \u2228 \u03c8(x, y 2 ). For i \u2208 \u03c9 let ci be ai bi and for j \u2208 \u03c9 let dj be a\u03c9+j b\u03c9+j . We claim\nthis is as the fact requires. Fix i, j \u2208 \u03c9. There is \u03b1 realizing the type\n^\n^\n\u03c6(x, aj ) \u2227 \u03c8(x, b\u03c9+j ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c6(x, ak ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c8(x, bl ).\nk6=i\n\nl6=\u03c9+j\n\nThus \u03b1 realizes \u03b8(x, ci ) and \u03b8(x, dj ). If k 6= i then \u03b1 realizes \u00ac\u03c6(x, ai ) and \u00ac\u03c8(x, bi )\nand hence realizes \u00ac\u03b8(x, ci ). Finally if l 6= j then \u03b1 realizes \u00ac\u03b8(x, a\u03c9+l ) and \u00ac\u03b8(x, b\u03c9+l )\nand hence \u00ac\u03b8(x, dj ) as desired.\n\u0003\n3. Relationship with similar notions\nIn this brief section we examine the relationship between dp-minimality and various\nother strong forms of dependence.\nWe begin with the notion of VC-density as studied in [3]. For the ensuing definition we fix \u2206(x, y) a finite set of formulae where we consider y as the parameter\nvariables. If A is a set of |y|-tuples we write S \u2206 (A) for the set of complete \u2206-types\nwith parameters from A.\nDefinition 3.1. A theory T has VC-density one if for any finite set of formulae\n\u2206(x, y) there is a constant C so that for any finite set, A, of |y|-tuples S \u2206 (A) \u2264\nC |A||x| .\nFor example in [3] it is shown that any weakly o-minimal theory and any quasi\no-minimal theory with definable bounds (for which see [4]) has VC-density one. We\nhave a strong relationship between VC-density one and dp-minimality:\nProposition 3.2. If T has VC-density one then T is dp-minimal.\nProof. Suppose that T is not dp-minimal. Apply Fact 2.13 to find a formula \u03c6(x, y)\nand sequences ai and bj as described there. For N \u2208 N let\nAN = {ai : i \u2264 N} \u222a {bj : j \u2264 N}.\nBy the failure of dp-minimality we immediately see that S {\u03c6} (AN ) \u2265\nN. Thus T does not have VC-density one.\n\n1\n4\n\n|AN |2 for all\n\u0003\n\nNote that the above proof only requires that we have that S \u2206 (A) \u2264 C |A| for\n\u2206 consisting of formulae of the form \u03c6(x, y), i.e. with only one free variable. We\nmay use this fact to provide a novel proof for the dp-minimality of the theory of\nalgebraically closed valued fields. This fact was already observed in [2] and as the\nproof is somewhat technical we do not include it here.\nCorollary 3.3. Any weakly o-minimal theory as well as any quasi o-minimal theory\nwith definable bounds is dp-minimal.\n\n\f8\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\nWe give a short direct proof of the dp-minimality of any weakly o-minimal theory\nin the next section. Also under the assumption of VC-density one we obtain the\nimproved bounds in Fact 2.10(4) as discussed in section 2. With the same proof as\nin the previous proposition we show:\nProposition 3.4. If T has VC-density one there is no sequence of formulae\n\u03c61 (x, y), . . . , \u03c6n+1(x, y)\nwith |x| = n and sequences {aji : i \u2208 \u03c9} with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n so that form any \u03b7 :\n{1, . . . , n + 1} \u2192 \u03c9 the type\n^\n^\n^\n\u03c6k (x, ak\u03b7(k) ) \u2227\n\u00ac\u03c6k (x, akt )\n1\u2264k\u2264n+1\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n {t\u2208\u03c9:\u03b7(k)6=t}\n\nis consistent.\nWe consider the notion of VC-minimality as introduced in [2].\nDefinition 3.5. Fix a theory T and a monster model C |= T . T is VC-minimal if\nthere is a family of formulae \u03a6 of the the form \u03c6(x, y) so that:\n\u2022 If \u03c6(x, y), \u03c8(x, y) \u2208 \u03a6 and a, b \u2208 C then one of:\n\u2013 \u03c6(C, a) \u2286 \u03c8(C, b),\n\u2013 \u03c8(C, b) \u2286 \u03c6(C, a),\n\u2013 \u00ac\u03c6(C, a) \u2286 \u03c8(C, b),\n\u2013 \u03c8(C, b) \u2286 \u00ac\u03c6(C, a).\n\u2022 If X \u2286 C then there are a finite collection of \u03c6i (x, y) from \u03a6 and tuples ai \u2208 C\nso that X is a Boolean combination of the sets \u03c6i (C, ai ).\nOnce again we have a strong relation with dp-minimality.\nProposition 3.6. [2, Proposition 9] Any VC-minimal theory is dp-minimal.\nThis implication may not be reversed as the following proposition shows.\nProposition 3.7. Let L be the language consisting of unary predicates Pi with i \u2208\n\u03c91 . V\nFor any finite\nV I \u2286 \u03c91 and J \u2286 \u03c91 with I \u2229 J = \u2205 let \u03c3I,J,n be the sentence\n\u2265n\n\u2203 ( i\u2208I Pi x \u2227 j\u2208J \u00acPj x). Let T = {\u03c3I,J,n : for all I, J, n}. T is complete, has\nquantifier elimination, is dp-minimal (in fact has VC-density one), but is not VCminimal.\nProof. We sketch a proof and leave the details to the interested reader. Completeness\nand quantifier elimination for T are elementary. Quantifier elimination and Fact 2.9(2)\nyield that T is dp-minimal. For the non-VC minimality of T use quantifier elimination show that there is no family \u03a6 of formulae \u03c6(x, y) satisfying the compatibility\nconditions in the definition of VC-minimality and so that any Pi (x) can be obtained\nby a finite Boolean combination of sets defined by instances of \u03a6.\n\u0003\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n9\n\nThus we have an example of a theory which has VC-density one (and hence is\ndp-minimal) but is not VC-minimal. We do not have an example of a theory which\nis dp-minimal but does not have VC-density one.\n4. Weakly o-minimal theories\nIn this section we focus on weakly o-minimal theories and structures. To begin with\nwe show that any weakly o-minimal theory is dp-minimal. Dp-minimality for weakly\no-minimal theories first appears in [11, Corollary 3.8] where it is shown that any\nweakly o-minimal theory obtained via \"Shelah expansion\"-which we discuss below-\nis dp-minimal. We show via an example that not all weakly o-minimal theories may\nbe obtained this in way. The dp-minimality of weakly o-minimal theories is also\nestablished in [2] and [3] by indirect arguments. Here we give a short direct proof.\nTheorem 4.1. A weakly o-minimal theory is dp-minimal.\nProof. Suppose the result fails for a weakly o-minimal theory T and fix M |= T .\nLet \u03c6(x, y) and \u03c8(x, y) be formulae together with mutually indiscernible sequences\n{ai : i \u2208 \u03c9} and {bi : i \u2208 \u03c9} forming an ICT pattern. By Fact 2.12 we assume that\nfor all i, j \u2208 \u03c9 that \u03c6(x, ai ) and \u03c8(x, bj ) define single convex sets. To ease notation\nlet Ai = \u03c6(M, ai ) and Bi = \u03c8(x, bi ). We assume these convex sets are infinite since\notherwise we obtain a contradiction. For convex sets X, Y \u2286 M write X \u227a Y if for\nany y \u2208 Y there is x \u2208 X so that x < y, X 6\u2286 Y , and Y 6\u2286 X. Notice that \u227a linearly\norders any family of convex sets satisfying no containment relations. We assume that\nfor all i \u2208 \u03c9 that Ai and Bi are bounded convex sets since otherwise we easily arrive\nat a contradiction. Note that there can be no containments among any of the sets Ai\nand Bj . Without loss of generality assume that A0 \u227a A1 . We show that A0 \u2229 A1 6= \u2205.\nIf not then A0 \u227a B0 \u227a A1 . If B0 \u227a B1 then B1 \u2229A0 \u2286 A0 contradicting that these sets\nform an ICT pattern. But if B1 \u227a B0 then B0 \u227a A0 \u2286 B1 also contradicting that the\nsets form an ICT pattern. Thus A0 \u2229A1 6= \u2205 and symmetrically B0 \u2229B1 6= \u2205. To finish\nsuppose that B0 \u227a A0 (the case that A0 \u227a B0 is symmetric). Thus also B0 \u227a A1 ,\nand by mutual indiscernibility B1 \u227a A0 . If B1 \u227a B0 then B1 \u2229 A1 \u2286 B0 violating that\nthese sets form an ICT pattern. But if B0 \u227a B1 then B0 \u2229 A1 \u2286 B1 also violating\nthat these sets form on ICT pattern. Thus in all cases there is a contradiction,\n\u0003\nThis theorem immediately yields:\nCorollary 4.2. Any o-minimal theory is dp-minimal.\nTheorem 4.1 requires that the theory T be weakly o-minimal. We ask if the theory\nof a weakly o-minimal structure M is dp-minimal-recall that a weakly o-minimal\nstructure need not have weakly o-minimal theory. We do not know of an example of\na weakly o-minimal structure whose theory is not dp-minimal. Given the close relationship between a theory being weakly o-minimal and elimination of \u2203\u221e (for which\nsee [5, Section 2]) we are lead to ask about the relationship between dp-minimality\n\n\f10\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\nand elimination of \u2203\u221e . For example by [9, Lemma 3.3] any dp-minimal theory expanding that of divisible ordered Abelian groups must eliminate \u2203\u221e . However in full\ngenerality this implication is false. Consider the theory T of an equivalence relation\nwith infinitely many infinite classes together with a finite class of size n for each\nn \u2208 N. It is straightforward to verify that T is dp-minimal and T obviously does not\neliminate \u2203\u221e . Of course the converse is also false, the random graph eliminates \u2203\u221e\nbut is not dp-minimal.\nAs mentioned earlier Onshuus and Usvyatsov [11, Corollary 3.8] prove that the\ntheory of a Shelah expansion of an o-minimal structure is dp-minimal. The Shelah\nexpansion is constructed by beginning with a structure M and an |M|+ -saturated\nelementary extension N of M and expanding M to M\u2217 by adding predicates for all\nsets of the form X \u2229 M m where X \u2286 N m is N-definable. It follows by results in [13,\nSection 1] that if M is o-minimal then M\u2217 has weakly o-minimal theory. Notice\nof course that the theory of any reduct of M\u2217 must also be weakly o-minimal and\ndp-minimal.\nTo complete the picture regarding weak o-minimality and dp-minimality we give\nan example of a structure M = hM, +, <, . . . i which is a model of the theory of\ndivisible ordered Abelian groups, has weakly o-minimal theory, and so that no model\nelementary equivalent to M may be obtained as a reduct of a Shelah expansion. Our\nexample is similar to one exhibited in [10, Example 2.6.2], differing primarily in that\nwe consider a theory expanding that of divisible ordered Abelian groups.\nExample 4.3. Let M be hQ \u00d7 Q, <, +, (0, 0), f, \u03bbq iq\u2208Q where < is the lexicographic\norder, + is componentwise addition, f is a unary function given by f ((a, b)) = (\u2212a, b)\nand if q \u2208 Q then \u03bbq is a unary function given by \u03bbq ((a, b)) = (qa, qb).\nThat M is a model of the theory of divisible ordered Abelian groups is immediate.\nFact 4.4. T h(M) admits quantifier elimination.\nProof. First notice that any term t is equivalent to a term t\u2032 so that the only occurrences of f in t\u2032 are applied to variables (i.e. if f (s) appears in the construction\nof t\u2032 then s is a variable). This follows easily since f commutes with addition and\nmultiplication by a rational. Next notice that for a, b \u2208 M a, b have the same first\ncoordinate if and only if \u03c6(a, b) holds where \u03c6(x, y) is the formula\n(x = y) \u2228 (x < y \u2227 f (x) < f (y)) \u2228 (y < x \u2227 f (y) < f (x).\nWe reduce to the case that we must eliminate a quantifier from a formula of the\nform \u2203x(s0 < x < s1 \u2227 t0 < f (x) < t1 ) where s0 , s2 , t0 , t1 are terms not involving x.\n(The case where some of the si or ti is \u00b1\u221e is similar.) It follows that this formula is\nequivalent to the conjunction of:\n\u2022 s0 < s1 \u2227 t0 < t1\n\u2022 \u03c6(s0 , s1 ) \u2192 (t0 \u2264 f (s0 ) \u2227 f (s1 ) \u2264 t1 )\n\u2022 (\u00ac\u03c6(s0 , s1 ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6(t0 , f (s1 )) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6(t1 , f (s0))) \u2192 f (s1 ) < t0 < t1 < f (s0 ).\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n11\n\n\u2022 (\u00ac\u03c6(s0 , s1 ) \u2227 \u03c6(t0 , f (s1 ))) \u2192 (t0 \u2264 f (s1 ) \u2227 t0 < t1 )\n\u2022 (\u00ac\u03c6(s0 , s1 ) \u2227 \u03c6(t1 , f (s0 ))) \u2192 (f (s0 ) \u2264 t1 \u2227 t0 < t1 )\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.5. T h(M) is weakly o-minimal.\nProposition 4.6. If M0 is an o-minimal reduct of a model of T h(M) and N is and\nelementary extension of M0 the graph of f is not definable in the structure induced\nby N on M0 .\nProof. Without loss of generality N is |M0 |-saturated. By [13, Section 1] it suffices to\nshow that for no definable X \u2282 (N)2 is X \u2229M0 the graph of f . By the o-minimality of\nN we decompose X into cells C1 , . . . , Cn . By [13, Section 1]) the structure induced on\nM0 by N is weakly o-minimal and thus for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and for some (a, q) \u2208 M0\nthe graph of f \u21be ((a, q), \u221e) is contained in Ci \u2229M0 . There are now two equally simply\ncases. Either Ci is the graph of a continuous (without loss of generality) monotone\nfunction or Ci is the region between the graphs of two continuous functions g1 and g2\nwhich we may also assume to be monotone.\nIf Ci is the graph of g then g((a + 1, q)) = (\u2212a \u2212 1, q) and g((a + 1, q + 1)) =\n(\u2212a + 1, q + 1). Thus g is increasing. But also g((a + 2, q)) = (\u2212a \u2212 2, q) and hence\ng is decreasing, a contradiction.\nIf Ci is the region between g1 and g2 then g1 ((a + 1), q)) < (\u2212a \u2212 1, q) and g1 ((a +\n1, q)) > (\u2212a \u2212 1, p) for all p < q. Hence g((a + 1), q)) > f ((a + 1, p)) > g((a + 1, p))\nand g is increasing. But g1 ((a + 2, q)) < (\u2212a \u2212 2, q) and thus g must be decreasing,\na contradiction.\n\u0003\n5. A complicated dp-minimal divisible ordered Abelian group\nIn this section we focus on theories T which extend that of dense linear ordering\nand so necessarily contain a symbol <. A reasonable question arising out of the work\nfound in [9] is whether every dp-minimal T expanding the theory of divisible ordered\nAbelian groups must be weakly o-minimal. In this section we show via an example\nthat the answer to this question is \"no\".\nFor the example let R((xR )) be the field of generalized power series with real coefficients, real exponents, and well-ordered supports. For a \u2208 R((xR )) write v(a) for\nits valuation. We wish to consider only the additive structure of the field augmented\nwith a new relation. Let L be the language consisting of a binary function +, a\nbinary relation <, a constant 0, unary functions sq for q \u2208 Q, a unary predicate P ,\nand binary predicates Rn for each natural number n \u2208 \u03c9 (including 0).\nLet R be the L structure with universe R((xR )) where +, <, 0 are interpreted in\nthe obvious way. Interpret the sq as multiplication by q for each q \u2208 Q. Interpret P\nas {x \u2208 R((xR )) : v(x) \u2208 Z}. Let R0 be the equivalence relation of being in the same\nconnected component of P or of R((xR )) \\ P . For each n > 0, let Rn be the set of all\n\n\f12\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\npairs so that either x \u2208 P and there is a sequence x = x0 < x1 < . . . < xn = y such\nthat xi \u2208 P if and only if i is even, but there is no such sequence x = x0 < x1 < . . . <\nxn+1 = y; or else x \u2208\n/ P and there is a sequence x = x0 < x1 < . . . < xn = y such that\nxi \u2208 P if and only if i is odd, but there is no sequence x = x0 < x1 < . . . < xn+1 = y.\nNotice that the Rn are definable in the language with just the group structure and\nP . We add them for quantifier elimination.\nOur first goal is to axiomatize T h(R) and to show this theory has quantifier elimination. To this end we describe a theory T we intend to show axiomatizes T h(R).\nT consists of:\n(1) The usual axioms for an ordered divisible Abelian group in the language\n{+, <, 0}, and sq denotes scalar multiplication by q.\n(2) 0 \u2208 P .\n(3) x \u2208 P if and only if \u2212x \u2208 P .\n(4) P and \u00acP are open sets.\n(5) If x \u2264 y and the interval [x, y] \u2286 P , then for any Q-linear combination z of x\nand y with positive coefficients, z lies in the same connected component of P\nas x and y.\n(5') If x \u2264 y and the interval [x, y] \u2286 \u00acP , then any Q-linear combination z of x\nand y with positive coefficients, z lies in the same connected component of\n\u00acP as x and y.\n(6) R0 is a symmetric relation, and if x \u2264 y, then R0 (x, y) holds if and only if the\ninterval [x, y] lies entirely within P or entirely within \u00acP .\n(7) For any x, y and positive n < \u03c9, Rn (x, y) holds if and only if x < y and there\nare exactly n \"alternations of P \" between x and y. More precisely, either:\n(A) x \u2208 P and there is a sequence x = x0 < x1 < . . . < xn = y such that\nxi \u2208 P if and only if i is even, but there is no such sequence x = x0 <\nx1 < . . . < xn+1 = y; or else\n(B) x \u2208\n/ P and there is a sequence x = x0 < x1 < . . . < xn = y such that\nxi \u2208 P if and only if i is odd, but there is no sequence x = x0 < x1 <\n. . . < xn+1 = y.\n(8) For any positive x there is a y such that R1 (x, y).\n(8') For any positive x there is a y such that R1 (y, x).\nFor M |= T and a \u2208 M we introduce some useful notation. If a \u2208 P (M) (respectively, \u00acP (M)) and C is the convex component of P (M) (or \u00acP (M))\nS containing\na, then [a] = C \u222a \u2212C. We say [a] \u2264 [b] if |a| \u2264 |b|, and let [a]\u2264 = [b]\u2264[a] [b]. So\nthe content of Axiom 8 is that the induced ordering on the classes [a] is a discrete\nordering with a left endpoint [0] but no right endpoint.\nLemma 5.1. 1. If [a] < [b], then a + b \u2208 [b].\n2. If [a] = [b], then a + b \u2208 [a]\u2264 .\n3. [a]\u2264 is closed under Q-linear combinations.\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n13\n\nProof. 1. If 0 < a < b, then a + b > b, so if a + b \u2208\n/ [b], then by Axiom 5, 2b < a + b.\nBut this implies that b < a, contradiction. If a < 0 < b, then 0 < \u2212a < b, so\n0 < a + b < b. So if a + b \u2208\n/ [b], then by Axiom 5 again, 2a + 2b < b, and b < 2(\u2212a),\na contradiction to Axiom 5. The other two cases are similar.\n2. Without loss of generality |a| \u2264 |b|. If 0 < a \u2264 b, then 0 < a + b \u2264 2b \u2208 [b], by\nAxiom 5. If a < 0 < b, then 0 < a + b < b, and so a + b \u2208 [b]\u2264 = [a]\u2264 . The other\ncases are similar.\n3. For any nonzero q \u2208 Q, qa \u2208 [a] by Axioms 3 and 5. The rest follows by 2. \u0003\nProposition 5.2. T is complete and has quantifier elimination.\nProof. We prove both statements simultaneously by a back-and-forth argument: suppose that M and N are \u03c9-saturated models of T , a = (a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) \u2286 M, b =\n(b0 , . . . , bn\u22121 ) \u2286 N, and tpqf (a, M) = tpqf (b, N). Then for every a\u2032 \u2208 M, we show\nthat there is some b\u2032 \u2208 N such that tpqf ((a, a\u2032 ), M) = tpqf ((b, b\u2032 ), N).\nWe do this by cases.\nCase A: a\u2032 is in the Q-linear span of a. Say a\u2032 = \u03a3i<n sqi (ai ).\nLet b\u2032 \u2208 N to be the corresponding Q-linear combination of b. If we pick i < n\nsuch that qi 6= 0 and [ai ] is as large as possible, then by Lemma 5.1, [a\u2032 ] = [ai ], and\nsimilarly [b\u2032 ] = [bi ]. The equality of the quantifier-free types now follows directly.\nCase B: a\u2032 is not in the Q-linear span of a but there is an element c in the Q-linear\nspan of a such that [a\u2032 ] = [c].\nWithout loss of generality, a\u2032 > 0. Let\n\b\nS0 = x \u2208 SpanQ (a) \u2229 [c] : x < a\u2032\nand let\n\b\nS1 = x \u2208 SpanQ (a) \u2229 [c] : a\u2032 < x .\nFor l = 0, 1, let hdli : i < \u03c9i be an enumeration of Sl . Since tpqf (a, M) = tpqf (b, N),\nwe can take corresponding sets T0 and T1 in N, with corresponding enumerations\nheli : i < \u03c9i.\nLet fi0 = a\u2032 \u2212 d0i and let fi1 = d1i \u2212 a\u2032 (these are always positive points). Then,\nusing the fact that the [*]-classes in both M and N are discrete linear orderings, we\ncan pick elements gil \u2208 N such that:\nI. If there is any x \u2208 SpanQ (a) such that [x] = [fil ] (or Rn (x, fil ), or Rn (fil , x)),\nthen let y \u2208 SpanQ (b) be the corresponding element and pick gil such that [gil ] = [y]\n(or Rn (y, gil), or Rn (gil , y));\nII. If x \u2208 SpanQ (a) and [x] < [fil ] (or [fil ] < [x]), then let y \u2208 SpanQ (b) be the\ncorresponding element, and we require that [y] < [gil ] (or [gil ] < [y]).\nClaim 5.3. There is an element b\u2032 \u2208 N satisfying the conditions:\n(1) b\u2032 is in the same [*]-class as any element of T0 or T1 ;\n(2) T0 < b\u2032 < T1 ;\n\n\f14\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\n(3) [b\u2032 \u2212 eli ] = [gil ] for any i < \u03c9 and l = 0, 1;\n(4) b\u2032 \u2208\n/ SpanQ (b).\n(Note that one of T0 or T1 may be empty, so half of the second condition may be\nvacuous.)\nProof. First assume T0 and T1 are nonempty, for simplicity.\nOne case is where {[gi0 ] : i < \u03c9} and {[gi1 ] : i < \u03c9} have least elements-then call\nthese elements [gi0 ] and [gj1 ], and without loss of generality [gi0 ] \u2264 [gj1 ]. If [gi0 ] < [gj1 ]\nand [gi0 ]+ denotes the positive elements of this class, then pick some b\u2032 \u2208 e0i + [gi0 ]+\nsuch that:\ni. b\u2032 \u2208\n/ SpanQ (b),\nii. T0 < b\u2032 < T1 , and\niii. For any k such that a\u2032 \u2212 d0k \u2208 [fi0 ], b\u2032 \u2208 e0k + [gi0 ]+ .\n(This is always possible since [gi0]+ is infinite, being closed under scaling by positive\nelements of Q, and using compactness and \u03c9-saturation.) Using Lemma 5.1, it follows\nthat for any k < \u03c9 and l = 0, 1, [b\u2032 \u2212 elk ] = [gkl ]. On the other hand, if [gi0 ] = [gi1 ],\nthen in picking the element b\u2032 as above, we can ensure in addition that b\u2032 \u2208 e1j \u2212 [gi1 ]+ ,\nand that for every k such that d1k \u2212 a\u2032 \u2208 [fi1 ], b\u2032 \u2208 e1k \u2212 [gi1 ]+ ; this is enough to ensure\nthat b\u2032 satisfies the properties we want.\nIf {[gi0] : i < \u03c9} and {[gi1] : i < \u03c9} have no least elements, then we can use compactness and \u03c9-saturation to pick b\u2032 \u2208 N such that for every i < \u03c9, b\u2032 \u2208 e0i + [gi0 ]+\nand b\u2032 \u2208 e1i \u2212 [gi1 ]+ , and it automatically follows that b\u2032 \u2208\n/ SpanQ (b). The \"mixed\ncase\" (one of these sets has a least element, the other does not) is handled similarly.\nFinally, if T0 is empty, note that T1 cannot have a least element (since if x \u2208 T1\nthen 12 x must be as well), so the usual compactness argument ensures there is a b\u2032 in\nthe right [*]-class such that b\u2032 < T1 . As above, we can also ensure that [b\u2032 \u2212 e1i ] = gi1\nfor each i < \u03c9. The case where T1 = \u2205 is symmetric.\n\u0003\nWith b\u2032 as above, Lemma 5.1 ensures that tpqf (b, b\u2032 ) = tpqf (a, a\u2032 ).\nCase C: Cases A and B fail, but there is some i < n such that a\u2032 \u2208 [ai ]\u2264 .\nChoose c0 , c1 \u2208 SpanQ (a) such that [c0 ] < [a\u2032 ] < [c1 ] but the \"distances\" are\nminimized: that is, if possible, there is some positive m such that Rm (c0 , a\u2032 ) holds\n(and similarly for c1 ), and such a number m is minimized. There are subcases: for\ninstance, if Rm0 (c0 , a\u2032 ) and Rm1 (a\u2032 , c1 ) hold, then we just need to pick b\u2032 \u2208 N such\nthat for the corresponding d0 , d1 \u2208 SpanQ (b), Rm0 (d0 , b\u2032 ) and Rm1 (b\u2032 , d1 ) hold. On the\nother hand, if there is no such m0 and no such m1 , then compactness and \u03c9-saturation\nyield a corresponding b\u2032 \u2208 N. The final subcase (a\u2032 is a finite distance from one of\nthe ci but not the other) is handled in the same way, noting that Axiom 8 ensures\nthat if there are infinitely many components of P (N) between d0 and d1 , then there\nare always elements b\u2032 \u2208 N such that Rk (d0 , b\u2032 ) or Rk (b\u2032 , d1 ), for any k < \u03c9.\nCase D: Previous cases fail, but there is some i < n and some positive m such that\nRm (ai , |a\u2032 |) holds.\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n15\n\nChoose i and m such that m is minimal. By Lemma 5.1, the truth values of Rk (c, a\u2032 )\nand Rk (a\u2032 , c) for any c \u2208 SpanQ (a) are now uniquely determined. By Axiom 8, there\nis a corresponding b\u2032 \u2208 N.\nCase E: The only remaining case is that |a\u2032 | is greater than every |ai | and Rm (ai , |a\u2032|)\nfails for every possible i and every m < \u03c9. Then by Lemma 5.1, the only additional\ninformation needed to determine tpqf ((a, a\u2032 ), M) is the sign of a\u2032 . A corresponding\nb\u2032 \u2208 N exists by Axiom 8 and \u03c9-saturation.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.4. If M |= T and X \u2282 M is infinite and definable then X has interior\nyet T is not weakly o-minimal.\nProof. This follows immediately from the quantifier elimination.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.5. T does not have the independence property.\nProof. Let I be indiscernible over \u2205 with uncountable cofinality. Without loss of\ngenerality I is increasing, and there are three possibilities: either all elements of I are\nin the same [*]-class, or else we have some n < \u03c9 such that Rn (ai , ai+1 ) holds for every\nai \u2208 I, or else neither of these hold and there are infinitely many [*]-classes between\ntwo adjacent elements of I. Suppose that A is any finite set. Then there are only\nfinitely many [*]-classes in dcl(A) (by Lemma 5.1), and in either of the three cases, it\nis straightforward to check using quantifier elimination that some cofinal subsequence\nof I is indiscernible over A.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.6. T is dp-minimal.\nProof. Suppose that t(x, y) is any term in T ; then we can write t(x, y) = qx + s(y)\nfor some q \u2208 Q and some term s(y). If a, b \u2208 M |= T , then there is some c \u2208 P (M)\nsuch that [c] > [s(a)] and [c] > [s(b)]. By Lemma 5.1, as long as q 6= 0, M |=\nP (t(c, a)) \u2227 P (t(c, b)). So for any t(x, y) that depends nontrivially on x,\nT \u22a2 \u2200y 0 \u2200y 1 \u2203x [P (t(x, y 0 )) \u2227 P (t(x, y1 ))] .\nThe same argument works with \u00acP or \u00acRn in place of P , and for finite conjunctions\nof such formulae.\nThis means that if {\u03c6(x; ai ) : i < \u03c9} is a k-inconsistent sequence of formulae in T ,\neach of which is a conjunction of atomic formulae and negated atomic formulae, then\neach \u03c6(x; ai ) can be assumed to be a conjunction of formulae of the following three\nforms: t0 (x; ai ) < t1 (x; ai ), \u00ac (t0 (x; ai ) < t1 (x; ai )), or Rn (t0 (x; ai ), t1 (x; ai )). So each\n\u03c6(x; ai ) is a finite union of convex sets. From here we can argue as in the weakly\no-minimal case to show that T is inp-minimal.\n\u0003\nThus we have a non-weakly o-minimal theory T extending the theory of divisible\nordered Abelian groups which is dp-minimal. Notice though that Corollary 5.4 indicates that infinite definable subsets in models of T are not too complicated, namely\nthey must have interior. Pierre Simon [16] has recently shown that this must be the\n\n\f16\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\ncase, specifically an infinite definable subset of a dp-minimal divisible ordered Abelian\ngroup must have interior.\n6. dp-minimality of the p-adics\nIn this section our main goal is to show that if Qp is a p-adic field then T h(Qp )\nis dp-minimal. The main technical portion of our proof is written in a more general\ncontext than that of the p-adics in the hopes that our proof of the dp-minimality\nof the p-adics may be generalized to other Henselian valued fields. We begin by\nestablishing some notation and fixing the context for our work.\nIn what follows, N denotes the positive integers.\nLet K be a Henselian valued field, considered as a one-sorted structure in the\nlanguage Lvf = Lring \u222a {v(x) \u2264 v(y)}. Write v : K \u00d7 \u2192 \u0393 for the valuation and value\ngroup. We assume that K is elementarily equivalent to a valued field with value\ngroup Z; for example, K is an elementary extension of a p-adic field, which is the\napplication below.\nLet R be the valuation ring of K and let m be its maximal ideal.\nFix k \u2208 N. Note that 1+mk is a definable subgroup of K \u00d7 . Adapting notation from\nHrushosvki, we write RVk (K) for the quotient K \u00d7 /(1 + mk ). Let \u03c0k : K \u00d7 \u2192 RVk (K)\nbe the quotient map. For notational convenience, we define \u03c0k (0) to be a new element\n\u221e which we adjoin to RVk (K).\nAn easy calculation establishes the following proposition.\nProposition 6.1. For all z \u2208 K and all x, y \u2208 K \\ {z}, \u03c0k (x \u2212 z) = \u03c0k (y \u2212 z) if and\nonly if v(x \u2212 y) \u2265 v(y \u2212 z) + k.\nWe note that to establish this simple proposition we need to use the fact that our\ntheory has a model whose value group if Z.\nWe know isolate a special kind of formula whose definition is intended to mimic\nthe form of formulas defining cells (as in [7]) in the p-adic fields.\nDefinition 1. The formula \u03c6(x; y0 , . . . , yl ) is cell-like if there is k \u2208 N such that\n\u03c6(x; y0~y ) \u2227 \u03c0k (x \u2212 y0 ) = \u03c0k (x\u2032 \u2212 y0\u2032 ) implies \u03c6(x\u2032 ; y0\u2032 ~y ). We call y0 the center of\n\u03c6(x; y0 , . . . , yn ).\nLet K be as above, and assume further that the residue field K is finite and K is\n(2 ) -saturated. We show that there is no ICT pattern in K for which each formula\nis cell-like. On the contrary, assume that in K we have an ICT pattern as follows:\n\u03c9 +\n\nC1,1 , C1,2 , C1,3 , . . .\nC2,1 , C2,2 , C2,3 , . . .\nwhere Ci,j = {x \u2208 K : \u03c6i (x, di,j )} and \u03c6i (x; ~y ) is cell-like. Write ci,j for the center\nof Ci,j (i.e. ci,j = (di,j )0 ). We may assume that hd1,j ij and hd2,j ij are indexed by\nthe reals and are mutually indiscernible sequences. Choose k large enough so that it\nwitnesses that both \u03c61 and \u03c62 are cell-like. We write \u03c0 as an abbreviation for \u03c0k .\n\n\fDP-MINIMALITY: BASIC FACTS AND EXAMPLES\n\n17\n\nProposition 6.2. v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) = v(c1,2 \u2212 c2,1 ) and v(c2,1 \u2212 c1,1 ) = v(c2,2 \u2212 c1,1 ).\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to establish the first equality. Assume that v(c1,1 \u2212\nc2,1 ) 6= v(c1,2 \u2212 c2,1 ); without loss of generality, v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) < v(c1,2 \u2212 c2,1 ). By\nindiscernibility, hv(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 )ij is an increasing sequence in \u0393. Because hc1,j ij is\nuncountable and indiscernible over c2,1 , we see that each v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ) must be in a\ndistinct Archimedean class. In particular, for j \u2208 Z we have\n(1)\n\n* * * \u226a v(c1,\u22121 \u2212 c2,1 ) \u226a v(c1,0 \u2212 c2,1 ) \u226a v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) \u226a * * * .\n\nNote that by the ultrametric inequality, we know v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ) = v(c1,j \u2212 c1,j+1 ),\nfor all j \u2208 Z. Since, hc2,j ij is indiscernible over {c1,j }j , we have that v(c1,j \u2212 c2,2 ) =\nv(c1,j \u2212 c1,j+1 ) = v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ). Thus, for each j \u2208 Z, v(c2,2 \u2212 c2,1 ) \u2265 v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ).\n(Otherwise, by the ultrametric inequality, v(c1,j \u2212 c2,2 ) = v(c2,2 \u2212 c2,1 ); hence, from\nthe indiscernibility of hc1,j ij over {c2,j }j , we have v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,2 ) = v(c1,2 \u2212 c2,2 ), which\nis impossible.) A fortiori, for each j \u2208 Z, v(c2,2 \u2212 c2,1 ) \u226b v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ).\nChoose a \u2208 C2,1 \u2229 (K \\ C2,2 ) \u2229 C1,1 \u2229 (K \\ C1,2 ). Note that \u03c0(a \u2212 c2,1 ) 6= \u03c0(a \u2212 c2,2 ),\ni.e. v(c2,2 \u2212 c2,1 ) < v(a \u2212 c2,1 ) + k. Hence, v(a \u2212 c2,1 ) \u226b v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ) for all j \u2208 Z.\nHowever, this implies that \u03c0(a \u2212 c1,j ) = \u03c0(c2,1 \u2212 c1,j ). In particular, from the choice\nof a, we have c2,1 \u2208 C1,1 and c2,1 \u2208\n/ C1,2 . However, this contradicts the indiscernibility\nof hd1,j ij over c2,1 .\n\u0003\nProposition 6.3. v(c1,1 \u2212 c1,2 ) \u226b v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) and v(c1,1 \u2212 c1,2 ) \u226b v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ).\nProof. Again, by symmetry, it suffices to prove the first inequality. Via indiscernibility, Proposition 6.2 yields v(c1,j \u2212 c2,1 ) = v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) for all j \u2208 N. Since the residue\nfield is finite, a pigeon-hole argument shows that for each k \u2032 \u2208 N there are distinct\nj, j \u2032 \u2208 N such that \u03c0k\u2032 (c1,j \u2212c2,1 ) = \u03c0k\u2032 (c1,j \u2032 \u2212c2,1 ). In fact, by indiscernibility, we have\n\u03c0k\u2032 (c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) = \u03c0k\u2032 (c1,2 \u2212 c2,1 ) for all k \u2032 . In other words, v(c1,1 \u2212 c1,2 ) \u226b v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ),\nas desired.\n\u0003\nChoose a \u2208 C1,1 \u2229(K \\C1,2 )\u2229C2,1 \u2229(K \\C2,2 ). Then, since \u03c0(a\u2212c1,1 ) 6= \u03c0(a\u2212c1,2 ), we\nknow v(c1,2 \u2212c1,1 ) < v(a\u2212c1,1 ) + k. By Propositions 6.2 and 6.3, v(a\u2212c1,1 ) \u226b v(c1,1 \u2212\nc2,1 ) = v(c1,1 \u2212 c2,2 ). Hence, \u03c0(a \u2212 c2,1 ) = \u03c0(c1,1 \u2212 c2,1 ) and \u03c0(a \u2212 c2,2 ) = \u03c0(c1,1 \u2212 c2,2 ).\nBy the choice of a, we see c1,1 \u2208 C2,1 and c1,1 \u2208\n/ C2,2 , contradicting the indiscernibility\nof hd2,j ij over c1,1 . We have thus established:\nTheorem 6.4. If K is a Henselian valued field elementary equivalent to a valued\nfield with value group Z and K has finite residue field then K has no ICT pattern\nconsisting of cell-like formulae.\nWe are now ready to establish the dp-minimality of Qp . We recall some essential\nfacts on the p-adic fields necessary for our proofs.\nFix a prime p, and let Qp be the p-adic field, considered as a one-sorted structure\nin the language of rings. Write v : Q\u00d7\np \u2192 Z for the p-adic valuation. Recall that the\nrelation v(x) \u2264 v(y) is definable in the language of rings [7, Section 2]. Let K be a\n\n\f18\n\nALFRED DOLICH, JOHN GOODRICK, AND DAVID LIPPEL\n\nsufficiently saturated elementary extension of Qp ; all of the hypotheses of Theorem 6.4\nhold of K. Thus, there is no cell-like ICT pattern in K. To show Qp is dp-minimal,\nit suffice to show that if there is an ICT pattern in K, then there is a cell-like ICT\npattern in K.\nDefinition 2.\n(1) An annulus in K is a set of the form\nAnn(c, \u03b3, \u03b4) = {x \u2208 K : \u03b3 \u2265 v(x \u2212 c) \u2265 \u03b4},\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 \u222a {\u221e}, \u03b4 \u2208 \u0393 \u222a {\u2212\u221e} and c \u2208 K.\n(2) Let Pn be set of nth powers in K. A power coset in K is a set of the form\nPown,\u03bb (c) = {x \u2208 K : x \u2212 c \u2208 \u03bbPn },\nwhere, n \u2208 N, \u03bb \u2208 N \u222a {0}, and c \u2208 K.\n(3) A cell in K is a non-empty set of the form\nCelln,\u03bb (c, \u03b3, \u03b4) = Ann(c, \u03b3, \u03b4) \u2229 Pown,\u03bb (c).\nWe call c the center of Ann(c, \u03b3, \u03b4).\nRemark 1. For each n there are only finitely many cosets of Pn in K, each represented by some \u03bb \u2208 N. Thus, we consider \u03bb to be a term in the language, rather than\na parameter.\nProposition 6.5. A cell is cell-like.\nProof. It is clear that Ann(c, \u03b3, \u03b4) is cell-like with center c (as witnessed by any k \u2208 N).\nIt suffices to show that Pown,\u03bb (c) is also cell-like with center c. Using the HenselRychlik Theorem (see [8]) one can show that for each n \u2208 N there is k \u2208 N such that\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 N, if z \u2208 \u03bbPn and \u03c0k (z) = \u03c0k (z \u2032 ), then z \u2032 \u2208 \u03bbPn . Thus, this k witnesses\nthat Pown,\u03bb (c) is cell-like with center c.\n\u0003\nBy the cell-decomposition theorem (see [6]), every definable subset of K is a finite\nunion of cells. Suppose there was an ICT pattern in K. Then, by Fact 2.12, we get\nan ICT pattern of cells in K. However, this contradicts the results of the previous\nsection and hence we have:\nTheorem 6.6.
