INTRODUCTION\nOver the past few years there has been a significant effort into the study of the chiral extrapolation problem for lattice QCD. Extrapolation\nof lattice QCD simulation results to the light\nquark mass regime is nontrivial due to nonanalytic variation of hadron properties with quark\nmass. Such nonanalytic behaviour arises as a consequence of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in the QCD ground state.\nEarly research in extrapolations of nucleon\nproperties [1,2,3] discovered that one could obtain reliable extrapolations by incorporating the\nmodel-independent constraints of chiral symmetry near the chiral limit. Importantly, these studies highlighted the fact that the rapid, nonanalytic variation with quark mass must be suppressed at some intermediate energy scale. Above\npion masses \u223c 500 MeV, nucleon properties become smoothly varying functions of the quark\nmass, mq \u221d m2\u03c0 . This observation has a simple\nphysical explanation. Once the Compton wavelength of the pion becomes small (\u03bbC \u223c m\u22121\n\u03c0 )\nrelative to the finite extent of the nucleon, chiral\nloop effects become suppressed [4].\nRecent work has established that these features\nare all naturally built into chiral perturbation\ntheory (\u03c7PT) when evaluated with a finite-range\nregulator (FRR) [5]. The formulation of \u03c7PT\nwith chiral loop integrals cut-off in momentum\nspace at a finite energy scale has been established\nby Donoghue et al. [6]. Finite-range cutoff effects\n\nin chiral effective field theory have also been studied in the context of lattice regularised \u03c7PT [7].\nA case study of the nucleon mass expansion\n[5] has demonstrated that the use of FRR improves the convergence properties of the \u03c7PT expansion. The expansion has been demonstrated\nto be applicable up to pion masses of at least\nm2\u03c0 \u223c 0.8 GeV2 . This allows a reliable connection\nwith modern lattice QCD simulations. A range of\nfunctional forms for the momentum space cutoff\nhave been investigated and the systematic errors\ninduced by the cutoff have been found to be below\nthe 1% level.\nFollowing this study it has been demonstrated\nthat one-loop FRR-\u03c7PT is able to extrapolate\nmodern lattice QCD simulations of the nucleon\nmass with minimal systematic uncertainty [8].\nFigure 1 shows extrapolations of two-flavour dynamical QCD lattice data [9] based upon four\ndifferent functional forms for the regulator. The\nresidual dependence on the regulator is beyound\nthe resolution of this figure. With an increasing\nnumber of dynamical baryon simulations in lattice QCD [9,10,11,12] it is essential to incorporate\na correct treatment of chiral physics. Only then\ncan an interesting comparison of theory and experiment be carried out.\nIn this paper we highlight some of the features\nlearned about the chiral structure of baryons. In\nparticular we look at the nucleon and the \u2206 resonance in both dynamical and quenched simulations of QCD.

The physical nucleon mass is not a constraint\nin these fits.\n\nnamical sea quarks in baryon masses, relative to\nQQCD, can be explained by the modified chiral\nstructure [13]. Special features of the \u2206 baryon\nin quenched QCD also allow for a unique opportunity to study quenched chiral physics [14,15].\n2. BARYON MASSES\nAs outlined in the Introduction the use of a\nFRR in \u03c7PT is essential for the chiral expansion to be applicable at the quark masses simulated in state of the art dynamical lattice simulations. The application of quenched \u03c7PT [16]\nto quenched simulations has demonstrated similar\nsuccess with the use of a FRR [13]. The remarkable discovery of this work was that the primary\ndifference between quenched and dynamical spectroscopy can be explained by the differences in the\nchiral loop contributions.\nUsing FRR we express the chiral expansion of\nthe nucleon mass as [5]\nmB = a0 + a2 m2\u03c0 + a4 m4\u03c0 + \u03a3B (m\u03c0 , \u039b) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3B is the total contribution to the nucleon\nmass from chiral-meson loop diagrams and \u039b is\na regulator parameter governing the range. For\nthe nucleon mass the corresponding contributions\nare shown in Fig. 2, with analogous diagrams for\n\nFigure 2. Leading chiral loop corrections to the\nnucleon mass in QCD and quenched QCD. Solid,\ndouble and dashed curves correspond to nucleon,\n\u2206 and meson propagators. The cross denotes a\nhairpin insertion in the \u03b7 \u2032 propagator.\n\nthe \u2206. These diagrams give rise to the leading\nand next-to-leading nonanalytic behaviour in the\nchiral expansion. It is important to note that\nalthough \u03a3B is a function of \u039b, the dependence\non \u039b is removed through renormalisation of the\nchiral expansion [5].\nIn the quenched case we first note the inclusion\nof two additional diagrams which are absent in\nthe case of QCD. The flavour-singlet \u03b7 \u2032 is also a\nlight degree of freedom in the quenched theory\nand hence contributes to the low-energy effective\nfield theory [16]. Details of the role of the \u03b7 \u2032 in the\ncontext of baryon mass extrapolation have been\ndiscussed extensively in Ref. [13].\nThe contributions from the standard \u03c0-meson\nloops are also modified in the quenched theory.\nIn QCD meson-baryon loops are attractive and\nhence the binding energy has the effect of lowering the effective mass of the state in question. Of\nparticular interest in the quenched theory is the\nN \u2013\u03c0 loop contribution to the \u2206 mass. The sign\nof this diagram is reversed and the loop acts repulsively, raising the mass of the resonance in the\nquenched theory.\nThis phenomenology can easily be understood\nby considering a pictorial, quark-flow description\nof the processes contributing to the N \u2013\u03c0 loop in\nfull QCD. Figure 3 shows all different topological\ncontributions to the \u2206++ \u2192 N \u03c0 loop diagram.\nDiagrams (b) and (c) both indicate the propaga-\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3. Pictorial quark-flow view of the N \u2013\u03c0 meson-cloud contributions to the \u2206 baryon in full QCD.\n\ntion of an unphysical uuu octet baryon. These\ntwo processes must sum to zero in the physical\ntheory, i.e. (c)=\u2212(b). QCD is also flavour-blind\nand knows nothing of the quark flavour propagating in the loop, meaning that processes (a) and\n(b) are identical. In the quenched theory the only\nremaining diagram is (c), which is a uuu quark\nstate degenerate with the nucleon. By deduction\nthis contribution is precisely the same in magnitude as Fig. 3(a) with the opposite sign.\nFits of both quenched and dynamical simulations based upon Eq. (1) have been performed\nin Ref. [13]. In fitting to the results of staggered fermion simulations in quenched and 2+1flavour QCD [10] it was found that the analytic\ncoefficients ai of Eq. (1) show exceptional agreement between the quenched and dynamical simulations. This indicates that the most significant\ndifference between the quenched and dynamical\nspectroscopy can be accounted for by the corresponding differences in the leading chiral correc(Q)\ntions, \u03a3B \u2212 \u03a3B .\nThis observation allows one to take quenched\nlattice QCD data and determine a phenomenological estimate of the quenching effects. One simply\nfits quenched data using Eq. (1) with the appropriate quenched chiral corrections. By retaining\nthe fit parameters ai and replacing the chiral corrections by their corresponding full QCD contributions the physical masses can be reconstructed.\n\nIn Fig. 4 we show the fits to preliminary results\nof the CSSM Lattice Collaboration using FLIC\nfermions [17]. The lattice scale has been set via\nthe Sommer scale, r0 = 0.5 fm. This gives a lattice spacing of 0.128 fm on a 203 \u00d740 volume. The\nflattening of the \u2206 in the chiral regime is clearly\ndisplayed by these new simulation results. This\neffect is primarily caused by the reversal in sign\nof the \u2206 \u2192 N \u03c0 contribution as discussed above.\nThe dashed curves in Fig. 4 represent our esti(Q)\nmate of unquenching effects where \u03a3B has been\nreplaced by \u03a3B . The chiral contributions here\nhave been evaluated using a 0.8 GeV dipole regulator. This value was the optimal \u039b found in\nRef. [5] which gave best agreement between dynamical lattice QCD and experiment. These results are preliminary and finite volume effects are\nyet to be taken into account, yet we already see\nremarkable agreement with the experimentally\nmeasured masses.\nWe see from Fig. 4 that the \u2206 suffers from\nlarger quenching effects due to the repulsive N \u03c0\nloop contribution. It has also been recognised\nthat other excited states seem to lie systematically high in the quenched approximation. Using\nchirally improved quark actions the BGR Collaboration have noted that there seems to be a correlation between the quenched discrepancies and\nthe physically observed widths [18].

Stars\nindicate experimental values.\n\nveloped [19] it will be interesting to see if more\nquenched spectroscopy can be similarly understood in terms of chiral interactions.\n3. MAGNETIC MOMENTS\nChiral loop effects are known to give large\ncontributions to the electromagnetic structure of\nbaryons. In fact the leading nonanalytic contribution to the neutron's magnetic moment is nearly\none third the experimental value. Chiral symmetry effects in nucleon electromagnetic structure describe dynamical, nonperturbative structure beyond the simple quark model of QCD [20].\nSuch is the magnitude of the pion loop effects\nthat one should expect dramatic results in lattice calculations as the light quark mass regime\nis probed.\nOnce again we find that the repulsive interaction of the N \u03c0 loop means that the magnetic moment of the \u2206 baryon is especially interesting in\nQQCD.\nThe best lattice calculations of the electromagnetic structure of baryons have so far been\nrestricted to the quenched model of QCD [21,\n22]. Because of the absence of q q\u0304 pair-creation,\n\npion loop effects are typically suppressed in the\nquenched approximation [23,24,25]. However, the\ninclusion of the flavour singlet \u03b7 \u2032 does offer the\nopportunity for detection of enhanced chiral behaviour in quenched simulations. As a result of\ndouble-hairpin loops the leading nonanalytic contribution is log m\u03c0 - i.e. magnetic moments diverge in the chiral limit [23].\nIn the case of the \u2206 it is the next-to-leading\norder corrections which cause the most significant\nchiral effects. The flavour symmetry of the \u2206\ninterpolating fields ensure that in the quenched\napproximation, assuming isospin symmetry, the\nmagnetic moment is proportional to the charge.\nJust considering the \u2206++ is therefore sufficient to\ndetermine the chiral behaviour of all charge states\nin the quenched theory.\nWe apply the diagrammatic method of\nLeinweber [24,25] to determine the quenched chiral corrections to the \u2206 baryon magnetic moment. Preliminary results have been documented\nin Refs. [14,15].\nAs for the nucleon, the vertex correction from\nthe double hairpin \u03b7 \u2032 dressing gives rise to a leading logarithmic divergence. The magnetic current\ninduced by a pion loop is zero in the quenched\ntheory. In the case of the \u2206++ this is a trivial\nobservation, as meson fields can only be generated by u\u016b-pairs and must therefore be neutral.\nIt is the vertex corrections to the magnetic\nmoment which give rise to the most interesting\nphysics in the quenched approximation. In particular, it is once again the contribution from\nthe intermediate uuu-baryon which gives rise to a\nclear signal of quenched chiral physics. The contribution from the electromagnetic current coupling to the baryon in Fig. 3(c) causes a reversal\nof the chiral effect relative to physical QCD. As\nfor the case of the \u2206 mass as described above, the\nrepulsive interaction of this loop enhances the effect of quenching in the chiral regime.\nWe show preliminary results of FLIC fermion\nsimulations [17] of baryon magnetic moments [26].\nIn particular, we plot together the p and \u2206+ magnetic moments in Fig. 5. We observe that at moderate quark masses the expected heavy-quark theory result is observed, with the \u2206+ lying slighty\nabove the proton. However, in the light-quark\n\n\f5\n2.4\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\n2.2\n\nThe study of both masses and magnetic moments in the quenched approximation helps to\nprovide a deeper understanding of chiral extrapolation. This has also helped in developing a\ndeeper understanding of the internal structure of\nbaryons. In particular, we have identified that\nthe chiral structures evaluated in FRR\u03c7PT are\nable to describe quenched discrepancies in baryon\nmass calculations.\nWe identify that the \u2206 resonance offers unique\nfeatures to study the differing chiral properties\nof quenched and physical QCD. The flattening of\nthe \u2206 mass observed in FLIC fermion simulations\ndemonstrates a clear signal of quenching effects.\nIn the case of the magnetic moments the effect is\nmuch more dramatic. We see the turnover in the\n\u2206 magnetic moment in the chiral regime signifies clear nonperturbative effects, showing strong\ndeviation from the constituent-quark picture of\nQCD.\n\n\u039cB H\u039cN L\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nm\u03a0 2 HGeV2 L\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 5. Preliminary lattice results for proton\n(\u0004) and \u2206+ (N) magnetic moments. Curves represent best fit to data using FRR Q\u03c7PT.\n\nregime chiral physics becomes apparent with the\nclear separation of the two signals. The downward curvature in the \u2206+ is dominated by the\ncoupling to an intermediate octet baryon. This\ndemonstrates a clear picture of nonperturbative\neffects resulting from dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking in quenched lattice QCD.\nFinite volume effects cannot play a significant\nrole in the conclusions drawn from this study.\nThe opposite sign on the \u2206 \u2192 N \u03c0 loop means\nthat such a vertex correction to the \u2206 baryon\nmagnetic moment will also have a sign which is\nopposite to that of QCD. The pion loop contributions to the magnetic moments are p-wave\nand hence the main effect of the finite volume is\nto create a gap in momentum space between 0\nand 2\u03c0/L. Because the loop integrals are positive definite for both the proton and \u2206 when\nm\u03c0 + mN > m\u2206 , the finite volume can only suppress the magnitude of loop effects but cannot\nchange their sign. Studying the nucleon and \u2206\nmagnetic moments together therefore provides a\nclear signal of quenched chiral physics independent of volume effects.\nFinite volume effects in the octet baryon sector\nhave been studied in more detail in Ref. [27]. It\nis found that the finite volume discrepancies in\nthe meson-loop contributions are negligible at the\npion masses of interest.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council.\nREFERENCES\n1.
