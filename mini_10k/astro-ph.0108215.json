The giant early-type merger remnant galaxy NGC 1316 is\nan ideal probe for studying the long-term effects of a major merger on its\nglobular cluster (GC) system, given its spectroscopically derived merger\nage of \u223c 3 Gyr which we reported in a recent paper.

The observation that\nmassive, second-generation GCs formed during major mergers can survive\nfor at least 3 Gyr provides strong evidence that these clusters can have\n'normal' mass functions including low-mass stars, and hence that they\ncan survive to reach 'old age' similar to those of 'normal' ellipticals.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs this symposium emphasized once again, the study of globular clusters (GCs)\naround galaxies provides unique and important information regarding our understanding of how and when galaxies form. Their nature as simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) significantly simplifies the determination of their ages and\nmetallicities relative to that of stellar populations that constitute the integrated\nlight of their parent galaxies. A particularly interesting and now well-known\nfeature of the GC systems of giant early-type galaxies is the presence of bimodal color distributions, providing obvious evidence for the occurrence of a\n'second event' during the formation history of these galaxies (as discussed by\nmany authors in this volume [e.g., Brodie, Kissler-Patig, Schweizer, Zepf]). To\ndate, the only 'simple' model that actually predicted such a bimodality was that\nof Ashman & Zepf (1992), which modeled the properties of GCs forming in a\nmajor merger of gas-rich spirals (together with the giant elliptical host galaxies\nthemselves). They figured that the enriched gas associated with the spiral disks\nwould form 'red' (i.e., metal-rich) GCs during the merger. Soon afterwards,\nobservations of young merger remnant galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) revealed the presence of luminous young GCs (e.g., Holtzman et al. 1992;\nWhitmore et al. 1993), further supporting this 'merger scenario'.\nHowever, certain properties of the GC systems around some giant ellipticals\n(e.g., very large GC specific frequencies of central cluster galaxies) do not seem\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGoudfrooij\n\nto fit into this simple merger scenario, which prompted several groups to propose\nalternative concepts to explain the GC color bimodality. One such concept is\n'multi-phase collapse' (Forbes, Brodie, & Grillmair 1997) which proposes that\nthe metal-rich GCs are formed during a 'secondary collapse' phase of the galaxy\nwhich does not involve a merger. Another popular concept is the 'accretion\nscenario' (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Marzke & West 1998) which proposes that every galaxy is born\nwith a GC system that has a median color according to the color-magnitude\nrelation among galaxies. The color bimodality in giant ellipticals then arises\nthrough accretion of small galaxies by a large galaxy.\nGiven these different points of view, it is important to obtain additional\nevidence for or against the 'merger scenario'. Two rather major sources of debate\nin this regard are: (i) Whether or not the GCs formed in mergers lack low-mass\nstars so that they will disappear before reaching old age (see, e.g., Brodie et al.\n1998; Smith & Gallagher 2001), and (ii) whether or not general properties of GCs\nformed in mergers (i.e., their spatial distributions, ages, metallicities and specific\nfrequencies) are compatible with those of 'red' GCs in old ellipticals. These two\nissues are addressed in the remainder of this paper, using new results on the GC\nsystem of the giant intermediate-age merger remnant galaxy NGC 1316.\n2.\n\nSpectroscopic Evidence for 3-Gyr-old GCs in NGC 1316\n\nWe (Goudfrooij et al. 2001, hereafter Paper I) recently published results of\nmulti-slit spectroscopy of GC candidates in NGC 1316, an early-type galaxy\nthat is an obvious merger remnant (e.g., Schweizer 1980). We discovered the\npresence of \u223c 10 GCs associated with NGC 1316 that have luminosities up to\n\u223c 10 times higher than that of \u03c9 Cen. Our measurements of H\u03b1 and the Ca ii\ntriplet in the spectra of the brightest GCs showed them to have solar metallicity\n(to within 0.15 dex) and to have an age of 3.0 \u00b1 0.5 Gyr (Paper I; also shown\nas Fig. 2b in Schweizer's contribution to this volume). These are obviously GCs\nthat have formed from enriched gas during a merger. This reinforces the view\nthat luminous GCs formed during mergers do not necessarily have high low-mass\ncutoffs to their IMFs, and it also means that they can actually survive dynamical\ndisruption processes taking place during and after the merging process.\n3.\n\nColor-Magnitude Diagram of the GC system of NGC 1316\n\nWe have studied the photometric properties of the GC system of NGC 1316 using\na combination of HST/WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry using\nthe ESO NTT. The observations will be described in full detail in a forthcoming\nMNRAS paper; here we only show and discuss relevant results.\nThe B vs. B\u2212I color-magnitude diagram (CMD) from the WFPC2 data is\nshown in panel (c) of Fig. 1. The area which the GC system of the halo of the\nMilky Way (Harris 1996) would occupy if placed at the distance of NGC 1316\nis also indicated (see arrow). The positions of GC candidates in this CMD are\ncompared to predictions of SSP synthesis models in panels (a) and (b) of Fig.\n1 which show the time evolution of B \u2212 I and MB using the SSP models of\nBruzual & Charlot (1996, hereafter BC96). The metallicity range encompassed\nby the brightest clusters at an age of 3 \u00b1 0.5 Gyr, \u22120.15 <\n\u223c [Z/Z\u2299 ] <\n\u223c 0.15,\n\n\f3-Gyr-old GCs in NGC 1316\n\n3\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\nMilky Way\nGC system\n\nFigure 1.\nPanel (a): Time evolution of B\u2212I according to the Bruzual\n& Charlot (1996) SSP models. Metallicities are indicated above the\nmodels. The hatched region on the left indicates the B\u2212I color interval\npopulated by GCs of age 3.0 \u00b1 0.5 Gyr and with [Z/Z\u2299 ] = 1.0 \u00b1 0.15\ndex, while the hatched region on the right does so for a old, metalpoor cluster population such as that of the Milky Way halo. Panel (b):\nLuminosity evolution for a GC having the mass of \u03c9 Cen. Curves as\nin Panel (a). B magnitudes (at the distance of NGC 1316) for solar\nmetallicity at 3, 10 and 14 Gyr are indicated on the right. Panel (c):\nB vs. B\u2212I CMD from the HST photometry. The two hatched regions\nare the same ones as indicated on Panel (a). Note that the hatched\nregions fit the observed CMD of NGC 1316 clusters very well.\ncorresponds to 1.75 \u2264 B \u2212I \u2264 1.95 according to the BC96 models. Considering\nthe typical photometric errors of the WFPC2 photometry as well, we assigned\n1.65 \u2264 B \u2212 I \u2264 2.05 to the putative second-generation population of clusters,\nindicated as the hatched region on the left side of panel (a). The other hatched\nregion indicates the B \u2212 I interval occupied by the Galactic GC system which\ncorresponds to a metallicity range of \u22121.7 <\n\u223c [Z/Z\u2299 ] <\n\u223c \u22120.8 (Harris 1996),\nwhich is consistent with the model predictions at an age of 14 Gyr. Fig. 1 shows\nthat these two intervals provide a very good fit to the positions of the cluster\ncandidates on the CMD. Panel (b) shows that even after luminosity dimming\nto an age of say 10 Gyr, the 'red' clusters are up to several magnitudes more\nluminous (and hence more massive) than that of the most massive GC in our\nGalaxy.\nOur conclusion is that we are dealing with the presence of two distinct\ncluster populations: (i) a second-generation population clusters of roughly solar\nmetallicity that were formed \u223c 3 Gyr ago during a major spiral-spiral merger,\n\n\f4\n\nGoudfrooij\n\nand (ii) a population of old, primarily metal-poor clusters that were associated\nwith the progenitor galaxies.\n4.\n\nRadial Distributions of the GC (sub-)populations in NGC 1316\n\nThe radial surface density distribution of GC candidates in NGC 1316 is depicted\nin Fig. 2a, along with that of the integrated light of the galaxy. The GC surface\ndensity is seen to flatten off somewhat towards the centre with respect to the\nintegrated light profile (note that this excludes the possibility of being due to\nextinction by dust features in the inner regions). This is a known feature of GC\nsystems of 'old' giant ellipticals, in which this flattening is more pronounced (e.g.,\nForbes et al. 1998). It is most probably due to the accumulative effects of tidal\nshocking (which is most effective in the central regions) and dynamical friction\nduring the first few dynamical time-scales after the assembly of the galaxy (see,\ne.g., Fall and Vesperini's contributions to this volume). The more moderate\nflattening of the surface density of the GC system of NGC 1316 towards the\ncentre relative to those of 'old' ellipticals is consistent with the notion that\nNGC 1316 is only a few Gyr old. As to the GC surface density profile in the\nouter regions, fitting a power law results in a slope of \u22121.36 \u00b1 0.10, which is\nconsistent with the slope for the B\u2013band light of the galaxy in the same radial\nrange (\u22121.41 \u00b1 0.02). This suggests that the GC system originally experienced\nthe same violent relaxation as did the main body of the galaxy.\nA key prediction of the 'merger scenario' of Ashman & Zepf (1992) was\nthat the metal-rich GCs formed in mergers will be more centrally concentrated\nthan the pre-existing metal-poor GCs, which is the situation in well-studied\ngiant ellipticals (e.g,. Geisler, Lee, & Kim 1996). NGC 1316 is an important\nprobe to test this prediction, since dynamical evolution has acted over a much\nlonger time scale in NGC 1316 than in merger remnants studied to date (which\nare younger). To this end, we defined the 'blue' and 'red' subpopulations as\nfollows: 1.00 \u2264 B \u2212 I \u2264 1.55 ('blue') and 1.75 \u2264 B \u2212 I \u2264 2.50 ('red'). This\ndefinition purposely avoids the area overlapping the two hatched regions on Fig.\n1c. The radial distributions of both subpopulations are depicted on Fig. 2b.\nThe 'metal-rich' clusters are indeed clearly more centrally concentrated than\nthe 'metal-poor' ones, consistent with the predictions of the 'merger scenario'.\nDue to the page limit of this contribution, we refer the reader to a forthcoming MNRAS paper (astro-ph/0107533) which will include other photometric\nproperties of the GC system of NGC 1316 (e.g., luminosity functions for both\nsubpopulations, the specific frequency, and its evolution).\nAcknowledgments.
