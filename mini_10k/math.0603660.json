The roots of a smooth curve of hyperbolic polynomials may not\nin general be parameterized smoothly, even not C 1,\u03b1 for any \u03b1 > 0. A sufficient condition for the existence of a smooth parameterization is that no two\nof the increasingly ordered continuous roots meet of infinite order.

If the polynomials have certain symmetries we are able to weaken the assumptions in that\nstatement.\n\n1. Introduction\nConsider a smooth curve of monic hyperbolic (i.e. all roots real) polynomials\nwith fixed degree n:\nP (t)(x) = xn \u2212 a1 (t)xn\u22121 + a2 (t)xn\u22122 \u2212 * * * + (\u22121)n an (t)\n\n(t \u2208 R).\n\nIs it possible to find n smooth functions x1 (t), . . . , xn (t) which parameterize the\nroots of P (t) for each t? It has been shown in [28] that real analytic curves P (t)\nallow real analytic parameterizations of its roots, and in [1] that the roots of smooth\ncurves P (t) may be chosen smoothly if no two of the increasingly ordered continuous\nroots meet of infinite order. In general, as shown in [15], the roots of a C 3n curve\nP (t) of hyperbolic polynomials can be parameterized twice differentiable. That\nregularity of the roots is best possible: In general no C 1,\u03b1 parameterizations of the\nroots for any \u03b1 > 0 exist which is shown by examples in [1], [6], and [11]. Further\nreferences related to that topic are [8], [21], and [34].\nThe space Hypn of monic hyperbolic polynomials P of fixed degree n may be\nidentified with a semialgebraic subset in Rn , the coefficients of P being the coordinates. Then P (t) is a smooth curve in Hypn \u2286 Rn . If the curve P (t) lies in\nsome semialgebraic subset of Hypn , then it is evident that in general the conditions\nwhich guarantee smooth parameterizations of the roots of P (t) are weaker than\nthose mentioned in the previous paragraph. In the present paper we are going to\nstudy that phenomenon.\nIn section 3 we present a class of semialgebraic subsets in spaces of hyperbolic\npolynomials for which we are able to apply the described strategy. The construction\nof that class is based on results due to [32].\nOur main goal is to investigate the problem of finding smooth roots of P under\nthe assumption that the polynomials P (t) satisfy certain symmetries. More precisely, we shall assume that the roots x1 (t), . . . , xn (t) of P (t) fulfill some linear relations, i.e., there is a linear subspace U of Rn such that (x1 (t), . . . , xn (t)) \u2208 U for all\nDate: March 28, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 26C10, 22E45, 20F55.\nKey words and phrases. smooth roots of polynomials, invariants, representations.\nThe authors were supported by 'Fonds zur F\u00f6rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Projekt\nP 17108-N04'.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nt. Then the curve P (t) lies in the semialgebraic subset E(U ) of the space of hyperbolic polynomials Hypn = E(Rn ) = Rn / Sn of degree n, where E = (E1 , . . . , En )\nand Ei denotes the i-th elementary symmetric function. The symmetries of the\nroots of P (t) are represented by the action of the group W on U which is inherited\nfrom the action of the symmetric group Sn on Rn by permuting the coordinates:\nW = W (U ) := N (U )/Z(U ),\nwhere N (U ) := {\u03c4 \u2208 Sn : \u03c4.U = U } and Z(U ) := {\u03c4 \u2208 Sn : \u03c4.x = x for all x \u2208 U }.\nUnder the additional assumption that the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate the algebra R[U ]W of W -invariant polynomials on U , we will show that the\nconditions imposed on P (t) in order to guarantee the existence of a smooth parameterization of its roots may be weakened. These conditions will be formulated in\nterms of the two natural stratifications carried by U and E(U ) = U/W : the orbit\ntype stratification with respect to W and the restriction of the orbit type stratification with respect to Sn . The latter will be called ambient stratification. See section\n4. It will turn out (section 5) that we may find global smooth parameterizations of\nthe roots of P (t), provided that P (t) is normally nonflat with respect to the orbit\ntype stratification of E(U ) = U/W at any t. This condition is in general weaker\nthan the condition found in [1], since we prove in section 4 that normal nonflatness\nwith respect to the ambient stratification implies normal nonflatness with respect\nto the orbit type stratification. For a definition of 'normally nonflat' see 2.5.\nThese improvements are essentially applications of the lifting problem tackled\nin [2]. See also [16] and [17]. This generalization of the above problem studies\nthe question whether it is possible to lift smoothly a smooth curve in the orbit\nspace V /G of an orthogonal finite dimensional representation of a compact Lie\ngroup G into the representation space V . Here the orbit space V /G is identified\nwith the semialgebraic subset \u03c3(V ) in Rn given by the image of the orbit map\n\u03c3 = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n ) : V \u2192 Rn , where \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n constitute a system of homogeneous\ngenerators of the algebra R[V ]G of G-invariant polynomials on V . See section 2 for\ndetails.\nAs mentioned before a C 3n curve P (t) of hyperbolic polynomials of degree n\nallows twice differentiable parameterizations of its roots. Using results found for\nthe general lifting problem in [17], we are able to lower the degree of regularity in the\nassumption of that statement, if the polynomials P (t) satisfy certain symmetries.\nSee section 6.\nA class of examples for which the described refinements apply will be constructed\nin section 7. For illustration we consider the case when W is a finite reflection group\nin section 8. Moreover, explicit examples will be treated.\nThe problem of finding regular roots of families of hyperbolic polynomials has\nrelevance in the perturbation theory of selfadjoint operators (e.g. [14], [18], [28]) and\nin the theory of partial differential equations for the well-posedness of hyperbolic\nCauchy problems (e.g. [9], [12]).\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Representations of compact Lie groups. Let G be a compact Lie group\nand let \u03c1 : G \u2192 O(V ) be an orthogonal representation in a real finite dimensional\nEuclidean vector space V with inner product h | i. By a classical theorem of\nHilbert and Nagata, the algebra R[V ]G of invariant polynomials on V is finitely\ngenerated. So let \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n be a system of homogeneous generators of R[V ]G of\npositive degrees d1 , . . . , dn . Consider the orbit map \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n ) : V \u2192 Rn .\nThe image \u03c3(V ) is a semialgebraic set in Z := {y \u2208 Rn : P (y) = 0 for all P \u2208 I}\nwhere I is the ideal of relations between \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n . Since G is compact, \u03c3 is\n\n\fCHOOSING ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS WITH SYMMETRIES SMOOTHLY\n\n3\n\nproper and separates orbits of G, it thus induces a homeomorphism between V /G\nand \u03c3(V ), by the following lemma.\nLemma. Suppose that X and Y are locally compact, Hausdorff spaces and that\nf : X \u2192 Y is bijective, continuous, and proper. Then f is a homeomorphism.\nProof. (E.g. [7]) By defining f \u0303(\u221e) = \u221e, f extends to a continuous map f \u0303 : X \u222a\n{\u221e} \u2192 Y \u222a {\u221e} between the one point compactifications, since it is proper. If\nA \u2286 X is closed in X, then A \u222a {\u221e} is closed in X \u222a {\u221e} and hence compact.\nThen, f \u0303(A \u222a {\u221e}) is compact and hence closed in Y \u222a {\u221e}. Consequently, f (A) =\nf \u0303(A \u222a {\u221e}) \u2229 Y is closed in Y .\n\u0003\n2.2. Description of \u03c3(V ). Let h | i denote also the G-invariant dual inner product on V \u2217 . The differentials d\u03c3i : V \u2192 V \u2217 are G-equivariant, and the polynomials\nv 7\u2192 hd\u03c3i (v) | d\u03c3j (v)i are in R[V ]G and are entries of an n \u00d7 n symmetric matrix\nvalued polynomial\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nhd\u03c31 (v) | d\u03c31 (v)i * * * hd\u03c31 (v) | d\u03c3n (v)i\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n..\n..\nB(v) := \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\n.\n.\n.\nhd\u03c3n (v) | d\u03c31 (v)i\n\n***\n\nhd\u03c3n (v) | d\u03c3n (v)i\n\nThere is a unique matrix valued polynomial B\u0303 on Z such that B = B\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c3. The\nfollowing theorem is due to Procesi and Schwarz [27].\nTheorem. \u03c3(V ) = {z \u2208 Z : B\u0303(z) positive semidefinite}.\nThis theorem provides finitely many equations and inequalities describing \u03c3(V ).\nChanging the choice of generators may change the equations and inequalities, but\nnot the set they describe.\nFor each 1 \u2264 i1 < * * * < is \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 j1 < * * * < js \u2264 n (s \u2264 n) consider\nthe matrix with entries hd\u03c3ip | d\u03c3jq i for 1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 s. Denote its determinant by\n,...,js\n,...,js\n\u2206ji11,...,i\n. Then, \u2206ji11,...,i\nis a G-invariant polynomial on V , and thus there is a\ns\ns\n \u0303 j1 ,...,js on Z such that \u2206j1 ,...,js = \u2206\n \u0303 j1 ,...,js \u25e6 \u03c3.\nunique polynomial \u2206\ni1 ,...,is\ni1 ,...,is\ni1 ,...,is\n2.3. The problem of lifting curves. Let c : R \u2192 V /G = \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rn be a smooth\ncurve in the orbit space; smooth as curve in Rn . A curve c\u0304 : R \u2192 V is called lift\nof c to V , if c = \u03c3 \u25e6 c\u0304 holds. The problem of lifting smooth curves over invariants\nis independent of the choice of a system of homogeneous generators of R[V ]G in\nthe following sense: Suppose \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n and \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4m both generate R[V ]G . Then\nfor all i and j we have \u03c3i = pi (\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4m ) and \u03c4j = qj (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n ) for polynomials\npi and qj . If c\u03c3 = (c1 , . . . , cn ) is a curve in \u03c3(V ), then c\u03c4 = (q1 (c\u03c3 ), . . . , qm (c\u03c3 ))\ndefines a curve in \u03c4 (V ) of the same regularity. Any lift c\u0304 to V of the curve c\u03c3 , i.e.,\nc\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u25e6 c\u0304, is a lift of c\u03c4 as well (and conversely):\nc\u03c4 = (q1 (c\u03c3 ), . . . , qm (c\u03c3 )) = (q1 (\u03c3(c\u0304)), . . . , qm (\u03c3(c\u0304))) = (\u03c41 (c\u0304), . . . , \u03c4m (c\u0304)) = \u03c4 \u25e6 c\u0304.\n2.4. Stratification of the orbit space. Let H = Gv be the isotropy group of\nv \u2208 V and (H) the conjugacy class of H in G which is called the type of an orbit\nG.v. The union V(H) of orbits of type (H) is called an orbit type submanifold of the\nrepresentation \u03c1 and V(H) /G is called an orbit type submanifold of the orbit space\nV /G. The collection of connected components of the manifolds {V(H) /G} forms a\nstratification of V /G called orbit type stratification, see [26], [30]. The semialgebraic\nsubset \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rn is naturally Whitney stratified ([19]). The homeomorphism\nof V /G and \u03c3(V ) induced by \u03c3 provides an isomorphism between the orbit type\nstratification of V /G and the primary Whitney stratification of \u03c3(V ), see [5]. These\nfacts are essentially consequences of the slice theorem, see e.g. [30].\n\n\f4\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nThe inclusion relation on the set of subgroups of G induces a partial ordering on\nthe family of conjugacy classes. There is a unique minimum orbit type, the principal\norbit type, corresponding to the open and dense submanifold Vreg (respectively\nVreg /G) consisting of regular points, i.e., points where the isotropy representation\nis trivial. The points in the complement Vsing (respectively Vsing /G) are called\nsingular.\nTheorem. [27] Let B\u0303 be as in 2.2. The k-dimensional primary strata of \u03c3(V ) are\nthe connected components of the set {z \u2208 \u03c3(V ) : rank B\u0303(z) = k}.\n2.5. Smooth lifts. Let us recall some results from [2].\nLet s \u2208 N0 . Denote by As the union of all strata X of the orbit space V /G\nwith dim X \u2264 s, and by Is the ideal of R[Z] = R[V ]G consisting of all polynomials\nvanishing on As\u22121 . Let c : R \u2192 V /G = \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rn be a smooth curve, t \u2208 R, and\ns = s(c, t) a minimal integer such that, for a neighborhood J of t in R, we have\nc(J) \u2286 As . The curve c is called normally nonflat at t if there is f \u2208 Is such that\nf \u25e6 c is nonflat at t, i.e., the Taylor series of f \u25e6 c at t is not identically zero. A\nsmooth curve c : R \u2192 \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rn is called generic, if c is normally nonflat at t for\neach t \u2208 R.\nIt is easy to see, that c is normally nonflat at t \u2208 R if there is some integer\n1 \u2264 r \u2264 n such that:\n \u0303 j1 ,...,jk \u25e6 c vanish in a neighborhood of t whenever k > r.\n(1) The functions \u2206\ni1 ,...,ik\n \u0303 j1 ,...,jr such that \u2206\n \u0303 j1 ,...,jr \u25e6 c is nonflat at t.\n(2) There exists a minor \u2206\ni1 ,...,ir\n\ni1 ,...,ir\n\nTheorem. Let c : R \u2192 \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rn be a smooth curve which is normally nonflat\nat t \u2208 R. Then there exists a smooth lift c\u0304 in V of c, locally near t. If c is generic\nthen there exists a global smooth lift c\u0304 of c.\n2.6. Smooth roots. In the special case that the symmetric group Sn is acting\non Rn by permuting the coordinates there is the following interpretation of the\ndescribed lifting problem.

[1] Consider a smooth curve P (t), t \u2208 R, of monic hyperbolic polynomials of fixed degree n. Let one of the following two equivalent conditions be\nsatisfied:\n(1) If two of the increasingly ordered continuous roots meet of infinite order at\nt0 then their germs at t0 are equal.\n \u0303 k (P ) is not 0.\n(2) Let k be maximal with the property that the germ at t0 of \u2206\n \u0303\nThen \u2206k (P ) is not infinitely flat at t0 .\nThen P (t) is smoothly solvable near t = t0 . If (1) or (2) are satisfied for any t0 \u2208 R,\nthen the roots of P may be chosen smoothly globally, and any two choices differ by\na permutation.\nLemma. Condition (1) (and thus condition (2)) in the above theorem is satisfied\nif and only if P is normally nonflat at t0 as curve in E(Rn ) = Rn / Sn .\nProof. Let P be normally nonflat at t0 . Let s be a minimal integer such that P (t)\nlies in As for t near t0 and let f \u2208 Is be such that f \u25e6 P is not infinitely flat at t0 .\nDenote by I \u0304s the ideal in R[Rn ] defining the closed subset \u03c0 \u22121 (As\u22121 ) \u2286 Rn , where\n\u03c0 : Rn \u2192 Rn / Sn is the quotient projection.

By assumption, among the roots x1 (t), . . . , xn (t) there are\nprecisely s distinct for t near t0 . Hence the germs at t0 of the roots xi1 (t), . . . , xis (t)\nare distinct, and no two of them meet of infinite order at t0 . Therefore, condition\n(1) in the above theorem is satisfied.\nThe other direction is evident by (2.2).\n\u0003\n3. Lifting smooth curves in spaces of hyperbolic polynomials\n3.1. The problem.

We have Hypn = E(Rn ) = Rn / Sn , and, by means of 2.2, we may\ncalculate explicitly a set of inequalities defining Hypn (no equalities since the ring\nR[Rn ]Sn is polynomial).\n\n\f6\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nSuppose X is a semialgebraic subset of Hypn . Let c : R \u2192 X be a smooth curve\nin X; smooth as curve in Rn . We may view c as a curve in Hypn , i.e., as a smooth\ncurve of monic hyperbolic polynomials of degree n. In 2.6 sufficient conditions for\nthe existence of a smooth lift c\u0304 to Rn , i.e., a smooth parameterization of its roots,\nare presented. It is evident that a smooth curve c in X in order to be liftable\nsmoothly over E to E \u22121 (X) must in general fulfill weaker genericity conditions.\nOur purpose is to investigate that phenomenon.\n3.2. Orbit spaces embedded in spaces of hyperbolic polynomials. We recall\na construction due to L. Smith and R.E. Strong [32] (see also [3]) related to E.\nNoether's [25] proof of Hilbert's finiteness theorem as recounted by H. Weyl [35].\nLet \u03c1 : G \u2192 GL(V ) be a representation of a finite group G in a finite dimensional\nvector space V . Consider its induced representation in the dual V \u2217 . For an orbit\nB \u2286 V \u2217 set\nY\n\u03c6B (X) =\n(X + b)\nb\u2208B\n\nwhich we regard as an element of the ring R[V ][X], with X a new variable. The\npolynomial \u03c6B (X) is called the orbit polynomial of B. Evidently, \u03c6B \u2208 R[V ]G [X].\nIf |B| denotes the cardinality of the orbit B, we may expand \u03c6B (X) to a polynomial\nof degree |B| in X,\nX\nCi (B)X j ,\n\u03c6B (X) =\ni+j=|B|\n\nG\n\ndefining classes Ci (B) \u2208 R[V ] called the orbit Chern classes of B.\nTheorem (L. Smith and R.E. Strong [32]). Let \u03c1 : G \u0592\u2192 GL(V ) be a faithful\nrepresentation of a finite group G. Then there exist orbits B1 , . . . , Bl \u2286 V \u2217 such\nthat the associated orbit Chern classes Ci (Bj ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |Bj |, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l, generate\nR[V ]G .\nThe field of real numbers may be replaced by any field of either characteristic\nzero or characteristic larger than the order of G. For our purpose the reals will\nsuffice.\nThe Chern classes of the orbit are exactly the elementary symmetric functions\nin the elements of the orbit. If B \u2286 V \u2217 is an orbit and VB\u2217 is a vector space with\nbasis identified with the elements of B, then there is a natural map VB\u2217 \u2192 V \u2217 given\nby the identification. This map induces a map R[VB ]S|B| \u2192 R[V ]G which sends the\nk-th elementary symmetric function to the k-th orbit Chern class of B.\nIn this notation the above theorem says that there exist orbits B1 , . . . , Bl \u2286 V \u2217\nsuch that the induced map\nl\nO\n\nR[VBi ]S|Bi | \u2212\u2192 R[V ]G\n\ni=1\n\nis surjective.\nThe orbit Chern classes Ci (B) of an orbit B, viewed as invariant polynomials on\nV , define a G-invariant map\nC(B) = (C1 (B), . . . , C|B| (B)) : V \u2212\u2192 R|B|\nwhose image C(B)(V ) is a semialgebraic subset of the space Hyp|B| of hyperbolic\npolynomials of degree |B|.\nAccording to 2.1 and the above theorem, for any faithful representation \u03c1 : G \u0592\u2192\nGL(V ) of a finite group G there exist orbits B1 , . . . , Bl \u2286 V \u2217 such that the map\nC(\u03c1) = (C(B1 ), . . . , C(Bl )) : V \u2212\u2192 Hyp|B1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hyp|Bl | \u2286 R|B1 |+***+|Bl |\n\n\fCHOOSING ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS WITH SYMMETRIES SMOOTHLY\n\n7\n\ninduces a homeomorphism between the orbit space V /G and the image C(\u03c1)(V )\nwhich is a semialgebraic subset of Hyp|B1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hyp|Bl | . By increasing the number of orbits Bi if necessary, we may assume that each irreducible subspace of V\ncontributes at least one orbit Bi . Then, the linear forms b \u2208 B1 \u222a * * * \u222a Bl induce\nan injective inclusion V \u0592\u2192 R|B1 |+***+|Bl | .\nLet c : R \u2192 C(\u03c1)(V ) be a smooth curve. Then c = (c1 , . . . , cl ) where each\nci : R \u2192 C(Bi )(V ) is smooth. Since C(Bi )(V ) \u2286 Hyp|Bi | we may view ci as a\ncurve in Hyp|Bi | . If there exist smooth lifts c\u0304i : R \u2192 R|Bi | with respect to the\nrepresentations S|Bi | : R|Bi | , then c\u0304 = (c\u03041 , . . . , c\u0304l ) : R \u2192 R|B1 |+***+|Bl | is a smooth\nlift with respect to S|B1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S|Bl | : R|B1 |+***+|Bl | . Consequently, it suffices to\nstudy the case when there is given a smooth curve in a semialgebraic subset of some\nHypn . That is exactly the problem introduced in 3.1.\nSuppose c\u0303 : R \u2192 V is a smooth lift of c with respect to \u03c1. Then, there exists\na smooth lift c\u0304 : R \u2192 R|B1 |+***+|Bl | of c with respect to the representation of\nS|B1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S|Bl | on R|B1 |+***+|Bl | , namely\n\u001f\u007f\n// R|B1 |+***+|Bl |\n;; V\nx\nx\nc\u0303 xxx\nxx\nx\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\nxx\n\u007f\n// C(\u03c1)(V ) \u001f\n// Hyp|B1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hyp|Bl |\nR\nc\n\nIt follows, by 2.5, that conditions which guarantee that c is generic as curve in the\norbit space V /G suffice to imply the existence of a smooth lift of c with respect to\nS|B1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S|Bl | : R|B1 |+***+|Bl | .\nWe have seen that the above construction provides a class of semialgebraic subsets of spaces of hyperbolic polynomials, namely orbit spaces of faithful finite group\nrepresentations, for which we are able to apply the strategy described in 3.1, thanks\nto the results of 2.5.\nIn the remaining sections we shall change the point of view. Assume we are given\na curve of hyperbolic polynomials with certain symmetries. We will investigate\nwhether we can weaken the conditions in 2.6 which guarantee the existence of\nsmooth parameterizations of the roots. This will be performed in section 5. The\nfollowing section provides the necessary preparation.\n4. Orbit type and ambient stratification\nSuppose U is a linear subspace of Rn . Let the symmetric group Sn act on Rn by\npermuting the coordinates and endow U with the induced effective action of\nW = W (U ) := N (U )/Z(U ),\nwhere N (U ) := {\u03c4 \u2208 Sn : \u03c4.U = U } and Z(U ) := {\u03c4 \u2208 Sn : \u03c4.x = x for all x \u2208 U }.\nThen U carries two natural stratifications: the orbit type stratification with respect\nto the W -action and the restriction to U of the orbit type stratification of Rn with\nrespect to the Sn -action. It is easily seen that the latter indeed provides a Whitney\nstratification of U . Let us denote it as the ambient stratification of U .\nProposition 4.1. Let U be a linear subspace in Rn endowed with the induced action\nby W = W (U ). Then for the ambient and orbit type stratification of U we have:\n(1) Each ambient stratum is contained in a unique orbit type stratum.\n(2) Each orbit type stratum contains at least one ambient stratum of the same\ndimension and is the union of all contained ambient strata.\nProof. To (1): Let S be an ambient stratum, i.e., S is a component of Sn .RnH \u2229 U ,\nwhere H = (Sn )x for a x \u2208 U and RnH = {y \u2208 Rn : (Sn )y = H}. Since Sn is finite\n\n\f8\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nand the manifolds \u03c4.RnH for \u03c4 \u2208 Sn either coincide or are pairwise disjoint, the\ncomponents of Sn .RnH are open subsets of \u03c4.RnH for \u03c4 \u2208 Sn . Thus, we may assume\nthat S is a component of RnH \u2229 U .\nDenote by \u03c0 the quotient projection N (U ) \u2192 N (U )/Z(U ) = W . For any u \u2208 U\nwe have Wu = \u03c0(N (U ) \u2229 (Sn )u ) and thus RnH \u2229 U \u2286 {u \u2208 U : Wu = Wx }. By\ndefinition and a similar argument as above, the components of the subset {u \u2208 U :\nWu = Wx } are orbit type strata of U . So the ambient stratum S is contained in a\nunique isotropy type stratum RS .\nTo (2): Let R be an orbit type stratum and let S be the set of all ambient strata\nS such\nS that RS = R, where RS is the unique orbit type stratum from (1). Clearly,\nR = S and for each S \u2208 S we have dim S \u2264 dim R. Since the set S is finite,\nthere is a stratum S \u2208 S such that dim S = dim R.\n\u0003\nRemarks 4.2. (1) It is easy to see that proposition 4.1 is true if one replaces the\nSn -module Rn by any finite dimensional G-module V , where G is a finite group.\n(2) Proposition 4.1 implies that the orbit type stratification of U is coarser\nthan its ambient stratification. That means, following [26], that for each ambient\nstratum S there exists an orbit type stratum RS such that S \u2286 RS , id|S : S \u2192 RS\nis smooth, and for all S \u2286 S \u2032 we have RS \u2286 RS \u2032 . It remains to check the last\ncondition: Assume that S \u2286 S \u2032 . Since S \u2286 RS and S \u2286 S \u2032 \u2286 RS \u2032 , we obtain\nRS \u2229 RS \u2032 6= \u2205, and, by the frontier condition, RS \u2286 RS \u2032 .\nAssume that the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate the algebra R[U ]W . It\nfollows that E|U = (E1 |U , . . . , En |U ) induces a homeomorphism between U/W and\nthe semialgebraic subset E(U ) of Rn / Sn = E(Rn ) = Hypn , by 2.1. It is wellknown that U(H) \u2192 U(H) /W , where H = Wu for some u \u2208 U , is a Riemannian\nsubmersion. Since W is finite, it is even a local diffeomorphism. By proposition\n4.1, this implies that for any ambient stratum S in U the image E(S) is a smooth\nmanifold. The collection T = {E(S) : S ambient stratum in U } obviously coincides\nwith the collection obtained by restricting to E(U ) the orbit type stratification of\nRn / Sn = E(Rn ) = Hypn . It is easily verified that the frontier condition for the\norbit type stratification of Rn / Sn = E(Rn ) = Hypn implies the frontier condition\nfor T . Consequently, T provides a stratification of E(U ). Let us denote this\nstratification as the ambient stratification of E(U ).\nConsider a smooth curve c : R \u2192 E(U ) = U/W in the sense of 2.3. It may then\nbe also viewed as a smooth curve in Rn / Sn = E(Rn ) = Hypn . Thus it makes sense\nto speak about the normal nonflatness of c at some point t0 with respect to the\norbit type stratification of U/W on the one hand and with respect to the orbit type\nstratification of Rn / Sn on the other hand. To shorten notation we shall say that c\nis normally nonflat at t0 with respect to the ambient stratification of U/W iff it is\nnormally nonflat at t0 with respect to the orbit type stratification of Rn / Sn .\nProposition 4.3. Let U be a linear subspace in Rn endowed with the induced action\nby W = W (U ) and assume that the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate R[U ]W .\nConsider a smooth curve c : R \u2192 E(U ) = U/W . If c is normally nonflat at t0 with\nrespect to the ambient stratification of U/W , then it is normally nonflat at t0 with\nrespect to the orbit type stratification of U/W .\nProof. The set of reflection hyperplanes H of the reflection group Sn is in bijective\ncorrespondence with the set of linear functionals \u03c9H on Rn of the form xj \u2212 xi for\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, namely H is the kernel of \u03c9H . Let us consider the restrictions\n\u03c9H |U to U . If c is normally nonflat at t0 with respect to the ambient stratification,\nthen, by lemma 2.6, any two of the increasingly ordered continuous roots of the\npolynomial c(t) \u2208 E(U ) \u2286 Hypn either coincide identically near t0 or do not meet\nat t0 of infinite order. Then for the continuous lift c\u0304 of c defined by such a choice\n\n\fCHOOSING ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS WITH SYMMETRIES SMOOTHLY\n\n9\n\nof roots any function \u03c9H \u25e6 c\u0304 either vanishes identically near t0 or does not vanish\nat t0 of infinite order.\nLet s be a minimal integer such that c(t) lies in As,orb for t near t0 , where As,orb\nis the union of all orbit type strata of U/W of dimension \u2264 s.\nDenote by \u03c0U the projection U \u2192 U/W . Let R be an orbit type stratum\n\u22121\ncontained in \u03c0U\n(As\u22121,orb ) and let S1 , . . . , Sk be the ambient strata of the same\ndimension as R contained in R (see proposition 4.1). For each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k denote\nby Hj the set of reflection hyperplanes for reflections in Sn fixing Sj P\npointwise.\nLet \u03a9j be the set of linear functionals \u03c9H |U for H \u2208 Hj . Put fR,j = \u03c9\u2208\u03a9j \u03c9 2 .\nBy definition the equation fR,j = 0 defines a linear subspace of U in which Sj is\nQk\nan open subset. Let fR = j=1 fR,j . Consider the natural action of W on R[U ]\nand let W.fR = {fR1 , . . . , fRl } be the orbit through fR with respect to this action.\nDefine FR = fR1 * * * fRl . By construction FR \u2208 R[U ]W and the set ZR of zeros of FR\nviewed as a function on U/W is contained in As\u22121,orb . Moreover, As\u22121,orb is the\nunion of the ZR , where R ranges over all\nQ orbit type strata (of maximal dimension)\n\u22121\ncontained in \u03c0U\n(As\u22121,orb ). Thus F = R FR , where the product is taken over all\n\u22121\norbit type strata (of maximal dimension) R contained in \u03c0U\n(As\u22121,orb ), is a regular\nfunction on U/W whose set of zeros equals As\u22121,orb . By construction, the function\nF \u25e6 c is nonflat at t0 .\nThis proves the statement.\n\u0003\nWe define Famb (c) (resp. Forb (c)) to be the set of all t \u2208 R such that c is normally\nflat at t with respect to the ambient (resp. orbit type) stratification of E(U ). It\nfollows that in the situation of proposition 4.3 we have Forb (c) \u2286 Famb (c).\n5. Choosing roots of polynomials with symmetries smoothly\nConsider a smooth curve of hyperbolic polynomials\nP (t)(x) = xn \u2212 a1 (t)xn\u22121 + a2 (t)xn\u22122 \u2212 * * * + (\u22121)n an (t)\n\n(t \u2208 R).\n\nWe are interested in conditions that guarantee the existence of a smooth parameterization of the roots of P . Such conditions have been found in [1], see 2.6. There\nno additional assumptions on the polynomials P (t) have been made.\nIn this section we are going to improve those results if the set of roots\nx1 (t), . . . , xn (t) of P (t) has symmetries additional to its invariance under permutations.\nLet as assume that the additional symmetries of P (t) are given by linear relations\nbetween the roots of P (t). Otherwise put, there is a linear subspace U of Rn\nsuch that (x1 (t), . . . , xn (t)) \u2208 U for all t \u2208 R. Then, the curve P (t) lies in the\nsemialgebraic subset E(U ) of Hypn = E(Rn ) = Rn / Sn , the space of hyperbolic\npolynomials of degree n.\nThe linear subspace U \u2286 Rn inherits an effective action by the group W = W (U ).\nLet us suppose that the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate the algebra R[U ]W .\nThen E|U = (E1 |U , . . . , En |U ) induces a homeomorphism between U/W and the\nsemialgebraic subset E(U ) of Hypn , by 2.1.\nLemma 5.1. Consider a continuous curve of hyperbolic polynomials\nP (t)(x) = xn \u2212 a1 (t)xn\u22121 + a2 (t)xn\u22122 \u2212 * * * + (\u22121)n an (t)\n\n(t \u2208 R).\n\nLet U be some linear subspace of Rn and assume that the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264\nn, generate the algebra R[U ]W (U) . Then the following two conditions are equivalent:\n(1) There exists a continuous parameterization x(t) of the roots x1 (t), . . . , xn (t)\nof P (t) such that x(t) \u2208 U for all t \u2208 R.\n(2) P (t) \u2208 E(U ) for all t \u2208 R.\n\n\f10\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nProof. The implication (1) \u21d2 (2) is trivial. Suppose that P (t) is a continuous\ncurve in E(U ). By assumption, we may view P (t) as a curve in the orbit space\nU/W (U ) \u223c\n= E(U ). It allows a continuous lift x(t) into U , by [16] or [24], which\nconstitutes a parameterization of the roots of P (t).\n\u0003\nThe smooth curve of polynomials P (t) which lies in E(U ) may be viewed as a\nsmooth curve in the orbit space U/W in the sense of 2.3. A smooth lift of P (t) over\nthe orbit map E|U to the W -module U provides a smooth parameterization of the\nroots of the polynomials P (t).\nBy theorem 2.5, we may conclude: If P (t) is normally nonflat at t = t0 with\nrespect to the orbit type stratification of E(U ), then P (t) is smoothly solvable near\nt = t0 .\nConsider the closed sets Famb (P ) and Forb (P ), as defined in section 4. By proposition 4.3, the set Forb (P ) is contained in Famb (P ). We have found that that P (t)\nis smoothly solvable locally near any t0 \u2208 R\\Forb (P ). Any two smooth parameterizations of the roots of P (t) near such a t0 differ by a constant permutation,\nsee theorem 2.6. Thus the local solutions may be glued to a smooth solution on\nR\\Forb (P ).\nIt follows from a result in [15] (see also [17]) that any smooth curve of monic\nhyperbolic polynomials of fixed degree allows a global twice differentiable parameterization of its roots. By the methods used in [15], it is easy to combine this with\nthe result above in order to get the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.2. Consider a smooth curve of hyperbolic polynomials\nP (t)(x) = xn \u2212 a1 (t)xn\u22121 + a2 (t)xn\u22122 \u2212 * * * + (\u22121)n an (t)\n\n(t \u2208 R).\n\nn\n\nLet U be some linear subspace of R such that:\n(1) The restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate the algebra R[U ]W (U) .\n(2) P (t) \u2208 E(U ) for all t \u2208 R.\nThen: There exists a global twice differentiable parameterization of the roots of P (t)\non R which is smooth on R\\Forb (P ).\n\u0003\nRemark 5.3. The orbit type stratification and the ambient stratification of E(U ) do\nin general not coincide, whence theorem 5.2 provides an actual improvement of the\nstatement of theorem 2.6. In other words, in general we have Forb (P ) ( Famb (P ).\nIt may, for instance, happen that P (0) is regular in E(U ) = U/W but singular\nin Hypn = Rn / Sn and P (t) is normally flat at t = 0 with respect to the ambient\nstratification. See examples in section 8.\nLet us suppose that a linear subspace U of Rn is given. It is then a purely\ncomputational problem to check whether the assumptions we have made in the\nforgoing discussion are satisfied. There are algorithms in computational invariant\ntheory (e.g. [10], [33]) which allow to decide whether the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 n, generate the algebra R[U ]W (U) . If the answer is yes, theorem 2.2 provides\nan explicit way to describe the semialgebraic subset E(U ) \u2286 Hypn by a finite\nset of polynomial equations and inequalities. So the condition that the curve P\nlies in E(U ) may again be check computationally. The orbit type stratification\nand the ambient stratification of E(U ) can be determined explicitly using theorem\n2.4. Then all ingredients are supplied in order to decide whether the curve P (t) is\nnormally nonflat at some t = t0 with respect to the one or the other stratification\nof E(U ).\nNote that there are refined approaches and algorithms for computing the orbit\nspace V /G and its orbit type stratification of a G-module V (when identified with\nthe image of its orbit map). In [29] rational parameterizations of the strata are\n\n\fCHOOSING ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS WITH SYMMETRIES SMOOTHLY\n\n11\n\nobtained, while [4] provides an algorithm yielding a description of each stratum in\nterms of a minimal number of polynomial equations and inequalities, if G is finite.\nWe shall carry out that procedure explicitly in example 8.8.\n6. Choosing roots of polynomials with symmetries differentiably\nConsider a curve of hyperbolic polynomials\nP (t)(x) = xn \u2212 a1 (t)xn\u22121 + a2 (t)xn\u22122 \u2212 * * * + (\u22121)n an (t)\n\n(t \u2208 R).\n\nThen the following results are known:\nResult 6.1. We have:\n(1) If all ai are of class C n , then there exists a differentiable parameterization\nof the roots of P (t) with locally bounded derivative, [8], [34].\n(2) If all ai are of class C 2n , then any differentiable parameterization of the\nroots of P (t) is actually C 1 , [15], [21].\n(3) If all ai are of class C 3n , then there exists a twice differentiable parameterization of the roots of P (t), [15].\nIn [17] we have proved the following generalizations:\nResult 6.2. Let \u03c1 : G \u2192 O(V ) be a finite dimensional representation of a finite\ngroup G. Let d = d(\u03c1) be the maximum of the degrees of a minimal system of\nhomogeneous generators \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3m of R[V ]G . Write V = V1 \u2295* * *\u2295Vl as orthogonal\ndirect sum of irreducible subspaces Vi . Define ki := min{|G.v| : v \u2208 Vi \\{0}},\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, and k := max{d(\u03c1), k1 , . . . , kl }. Let c : R \u2192 V /G = \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rm be a\ncurve in the orbit space. Then:\n(1) If c is of class C k , then there exists a differentiable lift of c to V with locally\nbounded derivative.\n(2) If c is of class C k+d , then any differentiable lift of c is actually of class C 1 .\n(3) If c is of class C k+2d , then there exists a twice differentiable lift of c to V .\nAgain we may use these facts in order to improve the results for curves P (t) of\nhyperbolic polynomials with symmetries.\nLet U be some linear subspace of Rn such that the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\ngenerate the algebra R[U ]W (U) , and P (t) \u2208 E(U ) for all t \u2208 R. It follows that we\nmay view P (t) as a curve in the orbit space U/W (U ) = E(U ), and any lift of P (t)\nover the orbit map E|U to U gives a parameterization of the roots of P (t) of the\nsame regularity.\nProvided that the integer k, associated to the W (U )-module U as above, is less\nthan the degree n of the polynomials in P (t), we are able, using 6.2, to lower the\ndegree of regularity in the assumptions of the statements in 6.1. We shall give\nexamples in section 8.\n7. Construction of a class of examples\nWe will present a class of examples which our considerations apply to.\nLet G \u2286 O(V ) be a finite group whose action on the vector space V is irreducible\nand effective. Choose some non-zero orbit G.v. Introducing some numbering we\ncan write G.v = {g1 .v, . . . , gn .v}, where |G.v| = n and gi \u2208 G. We define a mapping\nFG,v : V \u2192 Rn by\nFG,v (x) := (hg1 .v | xi, . . . , hgn .v | xi).\nSince the linear span of G.v spans V , the mapping FG,v is a linear isomorphism\nonto its image FG,v (V ) =: UG,v . The linear space UG,v \u2286 Rn carries the action\nof WG,v := W (UG,v ) and a natural G-action given by transformations from WG,v .\nSince the G-action is irreducible, so is the WG,v -action. Hence UG,v \u2286 {y \u2208 Rn :\n\n\f12\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\ny1 +* * *+yn = 0}. Irreducibility and effectiveness of the G-action induce an injection\nG \u0592\u2192 WG,v . Thus we may consider G as a subgroup of WG,v , and in this picture\nFG,v is G-equivariant.\nRemark 7.1. The linear space UG,v always intersects the submanifold of regular\npoints in the Sn -module Rn . Namely: For 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n we define Ui,j =\n{FG,v (x) : hgS\ni .v | xi = hgj .v | xi, x \u2208 V }. By definition, Ui,j is a linear subspace\nof UG,v and i<j Ui,j is the set of singular points of the Sn -module Rn contained\nin UG,vS. Since, by definition, gi .v 6= gj .v for any i < j, we have dim Ui,j = n \u2212 1.\nThus, i<j Ui,j 6= UG,v , which gives the assertion.\nPut PG,v := E \u25e6 FG,v . Then PG,v is proper, since E and FG,v are proper.\n\nLemma 7.2. Suppose that PG,v separates G-orbits. Then we have G = WG,v .\nProof. The groups G and WG,v have the same orbits in UG,v . For: Suppose that\n\u03c4 \u2208 WG,v and x, y \u2208 V such that FG,v (y) = \u03c4.FG,v (x). Since PG,v separates orbits,\nit follows that there exists some g \u2208 G such that y = g.x, whence g.FG,v (x) =\n\u03c4.FG,v (x).\nNow choose x \u2208 V such that FG,v (x) is a regular point of the WG,v -module UG,v .\nThe regular points of any effective linear finite group representation are precisely\nthose with trivial isotropy groups. We may conclude that x is a regular point of the\nG-module V . So |WG,v | = |WG,v .FG,v (x)| = |G.x| = |G|, and thus G = WG,v . \u0003\nIf PG,v separates G-orbits, then, by lemma 7.2, the G = WG,v -modules V and\nUG,v are equivalent. In particular, it follows that the restriction E|UG,v separates\nWG,v -orbits, FG,v induces a homeomorphism between V /G and UG,v /W\u03c1,v , and\n\u2217\nFG,v\n: R[UG,v ]WG,v \u2192 R[V ]G is an algebra isomorphism.\nProposition 7.3. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) PG,v separates G-orbits.\n(2) For all x \u2208 V we have FG,v (G.x) = Sn .FG,v (x) \u2229 UG,v .\n(3) PG,v induces a homeomorphism between V /G and PG,v (V ).\nProof. Since E separates Sn -orbits, for each x \u2208 V there exists a z \u2208 Rn such that\nE \u22121 (z) = Sn .FG,v (x). Then the equivalence of (1) and (2) follows from\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(Sn .FG,v (x) \u2229 UG,v ).\n(Sn .FG,v (x)) = FG,v\n(z) = FG,v\nPG,v\n\nThe equivalence of (1) and (3) follows easily from lemma 2.1.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that the introduced construction of FG,v and PG,v essentially coincides with\nthe construction of orbit Chern classes as described in 3.2.\nLet us discuss uniqueness of the above construction. Suppose G \u2286 O(V ) is a\nfinite group. Denote by Aut(G) the group of automorphisms of G. Let S be the set\nof all reflections belonging to G. Denote by Aut(G, S) the group of automorphisms\nof G preserving the set S. Let a \u2208 Aut(G, S). A diffeomorphism T : V \u2192 V is\ncalled a-equivariant, if T \u25e6 g = a(g) \u25e6 T for any g \u2208 G (cf. [20]).\nLemma 7.4. Suppose G \u2286 O(V ) is a finite group. Let a \u2208 Aut(G, S) and let\nT : V \u2192 V be an a-equivariant diffeomorphism. Then the isotropy groups of x and\nT (x) are isomorphic, for all x \u2208 V , T maps orbits onto orbits, and T induces an\nautomorphism of the orbit type stratification of V .\nProof. It is easily seen that GT (x) = a(Gx ) and T (G.x) = G.T (x) for all x \u2208 V .\nFurther, it is evident that Gx = gHg \u22121 if and only if GT (x) = a(g)a(H)a(g)\u22121 .\nThe statement follows.\n\u0003\n\n\fCHOOSING ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS WITH SYMMETRIES SMOOTHLY\n\n13\n\nLet c : R \u2192 V /G = \u03c3(V ) \u2286 Rn be a smooth curve and c\u0304 : R \u2192 V a smooth lift\nof c. The orbit space V /G has a smooth structure given by the sheaf C \u221e (V /G) =\nC \u221e (V )G of smooth G-invariant functions on V . Then c induces a continuous\nalgebra morphism c\u2217 : C \u221e (V /G) \u2192 C \u221e (R) and c\u0304 induces a continuous algebra\nmorphism c\u0304\u2217 : C \u221e (V ) \u2192 C \u221e (R) such that c\u2217 = c\u0304\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2217 . This algebraic lifting\nproblem is equivalent to the geometrical one. It is evident that to determine c\u0304\u2217 it\nsuffices to know the images under c\u0304\u2217 of some system of global coordinate functions\nx1 , . . . , xm , where m = dim V . The same is true for c\u2217 , and in this case we may\ntake the basic invariants \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n as global coordinates functions, by Schwarz's\ntheorem [31]. If f : V /G \u2192 V /G is a smooth diffeomorphism one can take instead\nof the \u03c3i the functions f \u2217 (\u03c3i ) with the same result. Thus, the problem of smooth\nlifting is invariant with respect to the group of diffeomorphisms of V /G. Each such\ndiffeomorphism has a smooth lift to V which is an a-equivariant diffeomorphism, for\nsome a \u2208 Aut(G, S), see [20]. Conversely, any smooth a-equivariant diffeomorphism\nof V induces a smooth diffeomorphism of V /G, by lemma 7.4.\nTherefore, we may regard two constructions as described above, carried out for\ndistinct points v and w in V , as equivalent with respect to our lifting problem, if\nthere exists a smooth a-equivariant diffeomorphism T : V \u2192 V with v = T (w), for\nsome a \u2208 Aut(G, S).\nIf T is of a particular form, we can even say more.\nProposition 7.5. Suppose G \u2286 O(V ) is a finite group. Let v, w \u2208 V \\{0}. If there\nexists a homothety or an a-equivariant linear orthogonal map T : V \u2192 V , for some\na \u2208 Aut(G, S), such that v = T (w), then PG,v (V ) and PG,w (V ) are homeomorphic,\nand R[E1 \u25e6 FG,v , . . . , En \u25e6 FG,v ] and R[E1 \u25e6 FG,w , . . . , En \u25e6 FG,w ] are isomorphic.\nMoreover, in both cases, the ambient stratifications of UG,v and UG,w are isomorphic, i.e., there exists a linear isomorphism UG,v \u2192 UG,w mapping strata onto\nstrata.\nProof. If T is a homothety, then it is equivariant (a = id) and UG,v = UG,w . If T\nis a-equivariant linear orthogonal, then, by lemma 7.4, the linear subspaces UG,v\nand UG,w of Rn differ only by a permutation from Sn . In both cases PG,v (V )\nand PG,w (V ) are homeomorphic, and T \u2217 : R[E1 \u25e6 FG,v , . . . , En \u25e6 FG,v ] \u2192 R[E1 \u25e6\nFG,w , . . . , En \u25e6 FG,w ] is an algebra isomorphism.\nThe supplement in the lemma follows immediately from the fact that UG,v and\nUG,w differ only by a permutation of Sn .\n\u0003\nIf P (t) is a smooth curve of hyperbolic polynomials lying in PG,v (V ) and provided\nthat the polynomials Ei \u25e6FG,v , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate R[V ]G , we may apply the results\nof sections 5 and 6.\nWe will investigate the case of finite reflection groups in the next section.\n8. Finite reflection groups\nSuppose U is a linear subspace of Rn . Let the symmetric group Sn act on Rn by\npermuting the coordinates and endow U with the induced action of W = W (U ).\nWe shall assume in this section that W is a finite reflection group.\nRemark 8.1. If W is a finite reflection group, proposition 4.1 reduces to the following\nstatement: Any reflection hyperplane of W in U is the intersection with U of some\nreflection hyperplane of Sn in Rn . For: Let H be a reflection hyperplane of W in\nU . By proposition 4.1, there exists a ambient stratum S of U such that S \u2286 H\nand dim S = dim H. Obviously, S \u2286 (Rn )sing \u2229 U , and so there are reflection\nhyperplanes P1 , . . . , Pl of Sn in Rn which contain S. Since dim S = dim U \u2212 1,\nthere is a 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n such that Pi \u2229 U is a hyperplane in U . Since S is contained in\nboth H and Pi \u2229 U , we have H = Pi \u2229 U .\n\n\f14\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nFor any finite reflection group W \u2286 O(U ) we may write U as the orthogonal direct sum of W -invariant subspaces U0 = U W , U1 , . . . , Ul such that W is isomorphic\nto W0 \u00d7 W1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Wl , where Wi = {\u03c4 |Ui : \u03c4 \u2208 W }. Each Wi (i \u2265 1) is one of the\ngroups (e.g. [13])\nAm , m \u2265 1; Bm , m \u2265 2; Dm , m \u2265 4; Im\n2 , m \u2265 5, m 6= 6;\nG2 ; H3 ; H4 ; F4 ; E6 ; E7 ; E8 .\nIt follows that R[U ]W \u223c\n= U1 /W1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ul /Wl .\n= R[U1 ]W1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 R[Ul ]Wl and U/W \u223c\nA smooth curve c = (c1 , . . . , cl ) in the orbit space U/W is then smoothly liftable\nto U if and only if, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, ci is smoothly liftable to Ui . Note that\nthe orbit type stratification of U/W coincides with the product stratification of\nthe orbit type stratifications Zi of the factors Ui /Wi , i.e., the strata of U/W are\nS1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sl , where Si \u2208 Zi . Consequently, in order to apply the results of section\n5 and section 6 we may consider each factor Ui /Wi separately. So let us assume\nthat U is an irreducible W -module.\nTo this end we have to check whether the restrictions Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate\nthe algebra R[U ]W . In practice this is easily accomplishable: The unique degrees\nd1 , . . . , dm , where m = dim U , of the elements in a minimal system of homogeneous\ngenerators of R[U ]W are well known. It suffices to compute the Jacobian J of the\npolynomials Edi |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m. If J 6= 0 \u2208 R[U ] then they generate R[U ]W . Note\nthat a necessary condition for the Ei |U , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, to generate R[U ]W is that the\ndegrees d1 , . . . , dm must be pairwise distinct, see remark 8.4.\nLet us carry out the construction presented in section 7 for finite irreducible\nreflection groups G \u2286 O(V ). Let v \u2208 V \\{0}. If the polynomials Ei \u25e6 FG,v generate\nthe algebra R[V ]G , then WG,v is a finite irreducible reflection group as well, by\nlemma 7.2.\nFix a system \u03a0 of simple roots of G. For any v in the fundamental domain\nC = {x \u2208 V : hx | ri \u2265 0 for all r \u2208 \u03a0}, the isotropy group Gv is generated by the\nsimple reflections it contains (e.g. [13]).\nLemma 8.2. Let G \u2286 O(V ) be a finite reflection group. Each automorphism\nof the corresponding Coxeter diagram \u0393(G) induces an a-equivariant orthogonal\nautomorphism of V for some a \u2208 Aut(G, S).\nProof. ([20]) Since the vertices in the Coxeter diagram \u0393(G) represent the simple\nroots of G, an automorphism \u03c6 of \u0393(G), defines uniquely an automorphism a\u03c6 \u2208\nAut(G, S). Suppose the simple roots have unit length. Since they form a basis for\nV the automorphism \u03c6 defines naturally an orthogonal automorphism T\u03c6 of V . It\nis easily checked that T\u03c6 is a\u03c6 -equivariant.\n\u0003\nTheorem 8.3. Suppose G \u2286 O(V ) is a finite irreducible reflection group. Let\nv \u2208 V \\{0} such that the cardinality of Gv is maximal. Then: The polynomials\nEi \u25e6 FG,v , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, generate R[V ]G and PG,v induces a homeomorphism between\nV /G and PG,v (V ) if and only if G 6= Dm , m \u2265 4.\nProof. By proposition 7.5 and lemma 8.2 it suffices to check the statement for one\nsingle v 6= 0 with maximal Gv . Choosing e1 + * * * + em \u2212 mem+1 , e1 , and e1 for Am ,\nBm , and Im\n2 , respectively, one obtains the usual systems of basic invariants. The\nchoice e1 for Dm yields FDm ,e1 = FBm ,e1 , whence the polynomials Ei \u25e6 FDm ,e1 , 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 n = 2m, cannot separate Dm -orbits. For the remaining irreducible reflection\ngroups the necessary computations have been carried out by Mehta [23].\n\u0003\nRemark 8.4. If for Dm with m odd one chooses v = e1 + * * * + em , then the\npolynomials Ei \u25e6 FDm ,v , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n = 2m\u22121 , generate R[Rm ]Dm , since the Jacobian\nof the polynomials Ni \u25e6 FDm ,w , i = 2, 4, * * * , 2n \u2212 2, n, is up to a constant factor\n\n\fCHOOSING ROOTS OF POLYNOMIALS WITH SYMMETRIES SMOOTHLY\n\n15\n\nQ\ngiven by i<j (x2i \u2212 x2j ).

RAINER\n\nFurthermore, the intersections with UB3 ,v of the following hyperplanes in R8 ,\n{y1 = y8 , y2 = y7 , y3 = y6 , y4 = y5 },\nare not among the set of reflection hyperplanes of WB3 ,v . Therefore, the orbit type\nstratification of UB3 ,v is strictly coarser than its ambient stratification.\nWe follow the recipe for computing orbit type and ambient stratification of\nE(UB3 ,v ) = N (UB3 ,v ) given at the end of section 5. We will present only the\noutcome of the calculations. Using N2i \u25e6 FB3 ,v , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, as basic invariants of\nR[R3 ]B3 , we find that the symmetric matrix B\u0303 = (b\u0303ij ) from 2.2 has entries\nb\u030311 = 32z2 , b\u030312 = 64z4 , b\u030313 = 96z6 , b\u030322 = \u22123z23 + 36z2 z4 + 32z6 ,\n1\nb\u030323 = (5z24 \u2212 108z22z4 + 192z42 + 544z2z6 ),\n8\n1\n(27z25 \u2212 300z23z4 \u2212 1140z2z42 + 1140z22z6 + 7680z4z6 ).\nb\u030333 =\n64\n\u0013\n\u0012\n \u0303 ij = det b\u0303ii b\u0303ij\nwhere i < j.

The projection of N (UB3 ,v ) to the {z2 , z4 , z6 }-subspace\nand intersection with the surface {z22 \u2212 4z4 = 0}.\n\nLet f , g, h be functions defined in some neighborhood of 0 \u2208 R. Suppose that\nf and g are infinitely flat at 0 and h(0) = 0. For t near 0 consider the curve of\nP8\npolynomials P (t)(x) = x8 + j=1 (\u22121)j aj (t)x8\u2212j where\na1 = a3 = a5 = a7 = 0,\n\na2 = \u221256 + f, a4 = 784 + g, a6 = \u22122304 + h,\n1024a8 = 16a42 \u2212 128a22a4 + 256a24.\n(2)\n\nThen, for t near 0, P (t) is a curve in N (UB3 ,v ) with P (0) \u2208 S1 . At t = 0 it is\nnormally flat with respect to the ambient stratification but normally nonflat with\nrespect to the orbit type stratification.\nIf f , g and h are smooth, then P (t) is smoothly solvable near t = 0, by theorem\n5.2. Note that in this example we have d = k = 6 < 8 = n and thus theorem 8.7\nprovides an actual improvement, too.\nThe following example shows that W (U ) must not necessarily be a finite reflection group, even though the Ei |U generate R[U ]W (U) .\nExample 8.9. Let U be the subspace of R6 defined by the following equations\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 0,\n\nx4 + x5 + x6 = 0.\n\nThe subgroup N (U ) of S6 is generated by all permutations of x1 , x2 , x3 , all permutations of x4 , x5 , x6 , and the simultaneous transpositions of x1 and x4 , x2 and\nx5 , x3 and x6 . The subgroup Z(U ) is trivial. Thus W (U ) is isomorphic to the\nsemidirect product of S3 \u00d7 S3 and S2 .\n\n\f18\n\nM. LOSIK, A. RAINER\n\nOne can get the subspace U above as follows. Consider the point v =\n(x, x, x, y, y, y) \u2208 R6 , where x, y 6= 0 and x 6= y. The isotropy group H = (S6 )v\nof v is evidently isomorphic to S3 \u00d7 S3 . Then U = ((R6 )H )\u22a5 . The group H is the\nnormal subgroup of W (U ) generated by reflections.\nFirst consider the action of H on U . It is clear that the algebra R[U ]H is a\npolynomial algebra generated by the basic generators\ny1 = x21 + x22 + x1 x2 , z1 = x1 x2 (x1 + x2 ),\ny2 = x24 + x25 + x4 x5 , z2 = x4 x5 (x4 + x5 ).\nConsider the space R4 with the coordinates y1 , z1 , y2 , z2 and the action of the group\nS2 on it induced by the action of S2 = W (U )/(S3 \u00d7 S3 ) on the above basic generators. It is easy to check that this action coincides with the diagonal action of\nS2 on (R2 )2 for the standard action of S2 on R2 . Since the algebra of S2 -invariant\npolynomials on (R2 )2 is generated by the polarizations of basic invariants for the\nstandard action of S2 ob R2 we get the following system of generators of R[U ]W (U) :\nf1 = y1 + y2 , f2 = z1 + z2 , f3 = y12 + y22 , f4 = y1 z1 + y2 z2 , f5 = z12 + z22 .\nSimple calculations for the restrictions of the Newton polynomials Ni on R6 to U\ngives the following result:\nN1 |U = 0, N2 |U = 2f1 , N3 |U = \u22123f2 ,\nN4 |U = 2f3 , N5 |U = \u22125f4 , N6 |U = 3f5 + 3f1 f3 \u2212 f13 .\nThis proves that the morphism R[R6 ]S6 \u2192 R[U ]W (U) defined by restriction is surjective.\nReferences\n[1] D.
