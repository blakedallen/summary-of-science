Malajovich\u2021\n\nJanuary 15, 2003\n\nAbstract\nIn this paper, Smale's \u03b1 theory is generalized to the context of intrinsic\nNewton iteration on geodesically complete analytic Riemannian and Hermitian manifolds. Results are valid for analytic mappings from a manifold\nto a linear space of the same dimension, or for analytic vector fields on\nthe manifold. The invariant \u03b3 is defined by means of high order covariant derivatives. Bounds on the size of the basin of quadratic convergence\nare given. If the ambient manifold has negative sectional curvature, those\nbounds depend on the curvature. A criterion of quadratic convergence for\nNewton iteration from the information available at a point is also given.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and main results.\n\nNumerical problems posed in manifolds arise in many natural contexts. Classical\nexamples are given by the eigenvalue problem, the symmetric eigenvalue problem, invariant subspace computations, minimization problems with orthogonality\nconstraints, optimization problems with equality constraints ... etc. In the first\nexample, Ax = \u03bbx, the unknowns are the eigenvalue \u03bb \u2208 C and the eigenvector\nx \u2208 Pn\u22121 (C), the complex projective space consisting of complex vector lines\nthrough the origin in Cn . In the second example, Ax = \u03bbx, A real and symmetric, the unknowns are \u03bb \u2208 R and x \u2208 Sn\u22121 , the unit sphere in Rn . In the\nthird example the unknown is a k\u2212dimensional subspace contained in Cn that\nis an element of the Grassmann manifold Gn,k (C). The fourth example involves\n\u2217\n\nMIP.

The last example leads to problems posed\non submanifolds in Rn .\nFor such or similar problems our objective is to design algorithms which respect their geometrical structure. We follow here the lines of the Geometric\nIntegration Interest Group (http://www.focm.net/gi/) who showed the interest\nof such an approach.\nThe first author's original motivation came from homogeneous and multihomogeneous polynomial systems (Dedieu-Shub [6]) and also from a model for\nthe human spine (Adler-Dedieu-Margulies-Martens-Shub [1]) with configuration\nspace SO(3)18. A second motivation, for the second author, came from sparse\npolynomial systems of equations where the solutions belong to a certain toric\nvariety (Malajovich-Rojas [19]).\nFor such problems one often has to compute the solutions of a system of\nequations or to find the zeros of a vector field. For this reason we investigate\nhere one of the most famous method to approximately solve these problems: the\nNewton method.\nIn this paper, we investigate the local behavior of Newton's iteration close to a\nsolution. While a lot is known about Newton's iteration in linear spaces [2], little\nis known about intrinsic Newton's iteration in more general manifolds. Our main\nresults here (Theorems 1.3 to 1.6 below) extend Smale's \u03b1-theory to analytic Riemannian manifolds. \u03b1 theory provides a criterion for the quadratic convergence\nof Newton's iteration in a neighborhood of a solution. This criterion depends on\navailable data at the approximate solution. One important application (out of\nthe scope of this paper) is the construction of rigorous homotopy algorithms for\nthe solution of non-linear equations.\nMore precisely, we will study quantitative aspects of Newton's method for\nfinding zeros of mappings f : Mn \u2192 Rn and vector fields X : Mn \u2192 T Mn . Here\nMn denotes a real complete analytic Riemannian manifold, T Mn its tangent\nbundle, f and X are analytic. We denote by Tz Mn the tangent space at z to\nMn , by h., .iz the scalar product on Tz Mn with associated norm k.kz , by d the\nRiemannian metric on Mn and by expz : Tz Mn \u2192 Mn the exponential map. This\nmap is defined on the whole tangent bundle T Mn because Mn is assumed to be\ncomplete. We denote by rz > 0 the radius of injectivity of the exponential map\nat z. Thus, expz : BTz (0, rz ) \u2192 BMn (z, rz ) is one to one (B(u, r) is the open ball\nabout u with radius r, B\u0304(u, r) is the closed ball).\nWhen Mn = Rn the Newton operator associated with f is defined by\nNf (z) = z \u2212 Df (z)\u22121 f (z).\nIn this context Tz Rn may be identified to Rn and expz (u) = z + u so that\nNf (z) = expz (\u2212Df (z)\u22121 f (z)).\n2\n\n\fThis formula makes sense in the context of Riemannian manifolds and we define\nthe Newton operator Nf : Mn \u2192 Mn in this way.\nWhen, instead of a mapping Mn \u2192 Rn we consider a vector field X : Mn \u2192\nT Mn , in order to define Newton's method, we resort to an object studied in\ndifferential geometry; namely, the covariant derivative of vector fields. Let \u2207\ndenote the Levi-Civita connection on Mn . For any vector fields X and Y on\nMn , \u2207X (Y ) is called the covariant derivative of Y with respect to X. Since \u2207 is\ntensorial in X the value of \u2207X (Y ) at z \u2208 Mn depends only on the tangent vector\nu = X(z) \u2208 Tz Mn . For this reason we denote it\n(\u2207X (Y ))(z) = DY (z)(u).\nIt is a linear map\nDY (z) : Tz Mn \u2192 Tz Mn .\nThe Newton operator for the vector field X is defined by\nNX (z) = expz (\u2212DX(z)\u22121 X(z)).\nNotice this definition coincides with the usual one when X is a vector field in Rn\nbecause the covariant derivative is just the usual derivative.\nIn a vector space framework, Newton's method makes zeros of f with nonsingular derivative correspond to fixed points of Nf and Newton sequences xk+1 =\nNf (xk ), for an initial point x0 taken close to such a fixed point \u03b6, converge\nquadratically to \u03b6. In this paper, our aim is to make these statements precise in\nour new geometric framework and to investigate quantitative aspects. We have\nin mind the following two theorems which are valid when Mn is equal to Rn or\nin the more general context of an analytic mapping f : E \u2192 F between two real\nor complex Banach spaces:\nTheorem 1.1 (\u03b3\u2212Theorem, Smale, 1986) Suppose that f (\u03b6) = 0 and Df (\u03b6)\nis an isomorphism. Let\n\u03b3(f, z) = sup Df (z)\nk\u22652\n\nIf\n\n\u22121 D\n\nk\n\nf (z)\nk!\n\n1/k\u22121\n\n.\n\n\u221a\n3\u2212 7\nkz \u2212 \u03b6k \u2264\n2\u03b3(f, \u03b6)\n(k)\n\nthen the Newton sequence zk = Nf (z) is defined for all k \u2265 0 and\n\u0012 \u00132k \u22121\n1\nkz \u2212 \u03b6k.\nkzk \u2212 \u03b6k \u2264\n2\n3\n\n\fFor a proof see Blum-Cucker-Shub-Smale [2] Chap. 8, Theorem 1. The second theorem we want to extend to the context of Riemannian manifolds is the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 1.2 (\u03b1\u2212Theorem, Smale, 1986) Let\n\u03b2(f, z) = kDf (z)\u22121 f (z)k\nand\n\u03b1(f, z) = \u03b2(f, z)\u03b3(f, z).\nWe also let \u03b1(f, z) = \u221e when Df (z) is not invertible. There is a universal\nconstant \u03b10 > 0 with the following property: if \u03b1(f, z) < \u03b10 then there is a zero\n\u03b6 of f such that Df (\u03b6) is an isomorphism and such that the Newton sequence\n(k)\nzk = Nf (z) is defined for all k \u2265 0 and satisfies\n\u0012 \u00132k \u22121\n1\nkzk \u2212 \u03b6k \u2264\nkz \u2212 \u03b6k.\n2\nMoreover, the distance from z to the zero \u03b6 is at most 2\u03b2(f, z).\nThis second theorem is proved in Smale [35] with the constant \u03b10 = 0.13071 . . .\nand Kim [16] and [17] for a one-dimensional version.\n\n1.1\n\nDefinitions and notations.\n\nIn order to generalize these two results we have to define the corresponding invariants in the context of Riemannian manifolds.

An m\u2212tuple of such tensor fields is called a vectorial\ntensor field and the space of vectorial tensor fields is denoted by Tqp (Mn , Rm ).\nHere T \u2217 (Mn ) is the cotangent bundle on Mn (the space of 1\u2212forms) and\nF (Mn ) the space of scalar analytic functions defined on Mn . We let F (Mn ) =\nT00 (Mn ). Let \u2207 denote the Levi-Civita connection on Mn .

The first to consider\nNewton's method on a manifold is Rayleigh 1899 [26] who defined what we call\ntoday \"Rayleigh Quotient Iteration\" which is in fact a Newton iteration for a\nvector field on the sphere. Then, Shub 1986 [27] defined Newton's method for the\nproblem of finding the zeros of a vector field on a manifold and used retractions\nto send a neighborhood of the origin in the tangent space onto the manifold\nitself. In our paper we do not use general retractions but exponential maps.\nIndependently of [27], Smith 1994 [37] developed an intrinsic Newton's method\nand a conjugate gradient algorithm on a manifold using the exponential map.\nAlso independently, Udriste 1994 [38] studied Newton's method to find the zeros\nof a gradient vector field defined on a Riemannian manifold; Owren and Welfert\n1996 [24] defined Newton's iteration for solving the equation F (x) = 0 where F\nis a map from a Lie group to its corresponding Lie algebra; Edelman-Arias-Smith\n1998 [9] developed Newton's and conjugate gradient algorithms on the Grassmann\nand Stiefel manifolds. These authors define Newton's method via the exponential\nmap as we do here. Shub 1993 [28], Shub and Smale 1993-1996 [29], [30], [31], [32],\n[33], see also, Blum-Cucker-Shub-Smale 1998 [2], Malajovich 1994 [18], Dedieu\nand Shub 2000 [6] introduce and study Newton's method on projective spaces\n10\n\n\fand their products. Another important paper about this subject is Adler-DedieuMargulies-Martens-Shub 2001 [1] where qualitative aspects of Newton's method\non Riemannian manifolds are investigated for both mappings and vector fields.\nThis paper contains a nice application to a geometric model for the human spine\nrepresented as a 18\u2212tuple of 3 \u00d7 3 orthogonal matrices. Recently Ferreira-Svaiter\n[10] gave a Kantorovich-like theorem for Newton's method for vector fields defined\non Riemannian manifolds.\n\n2\n\nParallel transport and Taylor's formula.\n\nIn the proof sections of this paper, we frequently use parallel transport:\nDefinition 2.1 (Parallel transport.) Let z0 and z \u2208 Mn with z in the ball\nabout z0 with radius rz0 the radius of injectivity. Then, there exists a unique\ngeodesic curve c(t) in this ball such that c(0) = z0 and c(T ) = z for a certain T .\nIn this context we denote by\nPz0 ,z : Tz0 Mn \u2192 Tz Mn\nthe parallel transport along this geodesic. It is an isometry which preserves the\norientation when Mn is oriented.\nWe now extend this concept to other objects\nDefinition 2.2 (Parallel transport: extension.)\n\u2022 For a covector \u03c9z0 \u2208 Tz\u22170 Mn by\n(Pz0 ,z \u03c9z0 )(Yz ) = \u03c9z0 (Pz\u22121\n(Yz ))\n0 ,z\nfor any Yz \u2208 Tz Mn .\n\u2022 For a tensor field T \u2208 Tqp (Mn ) we denote by Tz0 its value at z0 that is\nTz0 ((\u03c9 1)z0 . . .

Sn denotes the unit sphere in Rn+1 , the\ntangent space Tx Sn is the hyperplane in Rn+1 orthogonal to x, the Riemannian\nstructure is given by the Euclidean structure of Rn+1 and the Riemannian distance\nin Sn is the arc length taken along great circles:\nd(x, y) = arccoshx, yi.\nThe exponential map at x \u2208 Sn is given by\nexpx (u) = x cos kuk + u\n\nsin kuk\nkuk\n\nfor any u \u2208 Tx Sn . The radius of injectivity is equal to rx = \u03c0 and the constant\nappearing in Definition 1.7 is Kx = 1 because Sn has positive sectional curvature.\nNewton's method is given by\nu = \u2212Df (x)\u22121 f (x),\nsin kuk\nNf (x) = x cos kuk + u\n.\nkuk\nThe size of the ball in Theorem 1.3 is equal to\n\u221a !\n3\u2212 7\n.\nR(f, \u03b6) = min \u03c0,\n2\u03b3(f, \u03b6)\n21\n\n\fSecond example: the orthogonal group. On denotes the orthogonal group.\nThe tangent space at the identity matrix idn is equal to An , the space of n by n\nantisymmetric matrices. More generally, the tangent space at u \u2208 On is equal to\nTu On = uAn .\nThis Riemannian structure is given by the usual scalar product of n by n matrices\nha, bi = Trace(bT a)\nfor any u \u2208 On and a, b \u2208 Tu On . The norm associated with this scalar product is\nthe Frobenius norm and it is denoted by kakF , while the usual spectral norm is\ndenoted by kak. On is a Lie group and this metric stucture is bi-invariant. Thus,\nthe constant appearing in Definition 1.7 is Ku = 1.\nThe exponential map at u \u2208 On is given by the exponential of matrices:\nexpu (a) = u exp (u\u22121a)\nfor any a \u2208 Tu On , with\nexp c =\n\n\u221e\nX\nck\nk=0\n\nk!\n\n.\n\nThe inverse of the exponential is the logarithm\nlog(idn + b) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)k+1\n\nk=1\n\nbk\nk\n\ndefined for any matrix b with kbk < 1. Thus, the inverse of the exponential map\n\u22121\nexp\u22121\nu (b) = u log(u b)\n\nis defined for any b \u2208 Tu On such that kidn \u2212 u\u22121 bk < 1 which is satisfied if and\nonly if ku \u2212 bk < 1. Consequently, the radius of injectivity is ru = 1. Newton's\nmethod is given by\nNf (u) = u exp (\u2212u\u22121 Df (u)\u22121f (u)).\nThe size of the ball in Theorem 1.3 is equal to\n\u221a !\n3\u2212 7\nR(f, \u03b6) = min 1,\n.\n2\u03b3(f, \u03b6)\nThird example: real projective space Pn (R). Real projective space may be\nconstructed as the quotient of S n \u2282 Rn+1 by the equivalence relation x \u2261 \u2212x.\nTherefore, it has positive sectional curvature and hence Kx = 1. The radius of\ninjectivity of the exponential is \u03c0/2.\n22\n\n\fNewton's method on Pn (R) may be constructed as in the unit sphere (First\nexample).\nThe size of the ball in Theorem 1.3 is equal to\n\u221a !\n3\u2212 7\n.\nR(f, \u03b6) = min \u03c0/2,\n2\u03b3(f, \u03b6)\nFourth example: Hermitian manifolds\nLet M be an analytic, Hermitian n-dimensional manifold with metric h*, *iH .\nIn particular, M is also a 2n-dimensional analytic, Riemannian manifold with\nmetric h*, *i = Re (h*, *iH ).\nIf f : M \u2192 Cn is analytic, we define a real analytic function fR : M \u2192 R2n\nby fR (z) = Re(f (z)), Im(f (z)).\nLet Df (z) : Tz M \u2192 Cn denote the complex derivative of f , in coordinates\nz1 , * * * , zn . Then,\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121 \u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\nDf (z)\n0\n1 i\n1 i\nDfR =\n1 \u2212i\n1 \u2212i\n0\nDf (z)\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nu\nIt follows that DfR (z)\n= fR (z) if and only if Df (z) * (u + iv) = f (z).\nv\nTherefore, Newton's method in an Hermitian manifold is also given by\n\u0001\nNf (z) = expz \u2212Df (z)\u22121 f (z)\nBy the same argument, the invariants \u03b2(f, z) = kDf (z)\u22121 f (z)k and \u03b3(f, z) =\nk\n\n1/k\u22121\n\nare equal, respectively, to the Riemannian invarisupk\u22652 Df (z)\u22121 D k!f (z)\nants \u03b2(fR , z) and \u03b3(fR , z).\nTherefore, Theorems 1.3 to 1.6 apply verbatim to Hermitian manifolds and\nmaps M \u2192 Cn , or to vector fields on Hermitian manifolds.\n\n6\n\nAlternative formulation of the R-\u03b3-Theorem\n\nIn this section we investigate a question posed by an anonymous referee about the\nR-\u03b3-Theorem (Theorem 1.3). Using another proof we state it independently of\nthe invariant K(\u03b6) introduced in Definition 1.7. We only state the R-\u03b3-Theorem\nfor mappings. The theorem for vector fields is analogous.\nTheorem 6.1 (R\u2212\u03b3\u2212theorem) There are constants \u03bd0 = 0.069778332 . . . and\nt0 = 0.075262346 . . . such that the following statement is true. Let Mn be geodesically complete and let f : Mn \u2192 Rn be analytic. Suppose that f (\u03b6) = 0 and\nDf (\u03b6) is an isomorphism.\n23\n\n\fLet\nR(f, \u03b6) = min (t0 r\u03b6 , \u03bd0 /\u03b3(f, \u03b6))\n(k)\n\nIf d(z, \u03b6) \u2264 R(f, \u03b6), then the Newton sequence zk = Nf (z) is defined for all\nk \u2265 0, and\n\u0012 \u00132k \u22121\n1\n\u03b2(f, z).\nd(zk , \u03b6) \u2264 \u03c3\n2\nWhich theorem is the best? Theorem 1.3 or Theorem 6.1?\nWhen Mn has a non-negative sectional curvature then, according to Corollary\n1.1, Theorem 1.3 gives a better result than Theorem\n\u0011\n\u0010 6.1. More\nq generally, when\n1\n2\nK\u03b6 < 2\u03bd0 +\u03bd0 \u22122 = 5.235326440 . . ., the expression K\u03b6 + 2 \u2212 K\u03b6 + 4K\u03b6 + 2 /2\nin the hypothesis of Theorem 1.3 is smaller than the constant \u03bd0 . This means\nthat, unless geodesics spread away by a factor larger than 5 in the relevant neighborhood, Theorem 1.3 is sharper than Theorem 6.1. Otherwise Theorem 6.1 may\nbe more useful.\nWe notice that, even if the formulation of Theorem 6.1 doesn't depend on\nK(\u03b6), both radius of (proved) quadratic convergence depend on the metric at\n\u03b6 via \u03b3(f, \u03b6) and consequently on the curvature at this point. This also proves\nthat, like in the case of linear spaces, the main invariant which estimates the size\nof the quadratic attraction basin of a root is the invariant gamma.\nProof of Theorem 6.1: Let \u03bd0 be the smallest positive root of the equation\n\u03bd0 /\u03c8(\u03bd0 )2 = \u03b10 .\nNumerically, \u03bd0 = 0.069778332 . . . Also, let\nt0 =\n\ns0\n1\u2212\u03bd0 = 0.075262346 . . .\ns0 + \u03c8(\u03bd\n0)\n\nWe assume that \u03b6 is such that f (\u03b6) = 0 and Df\u221a(\u03b6) is an isomorphism. Let z0 be\nsuch that d(\u03b6, z0 ) \u2264 \u03bd0 /\u03b3(f, \u03b6). Since \u03bd0 < 1 \u2212 2/2,\n\u221a\n2\n\u03bd = d(\u03b6, z0)\u03b3(f, \u03b6) < 1 \u2212\n2\nand by Lemma 4.3 we have\n\u03b2(f, z0 ) \u2264\n\n1\u2212\u03bd \u03bd\n1\u2212\u03bd\nd(z0 , \u03b6) =\n\u03c8(\u03bd)\n\u03c8(\u03bd) \u03b3(f, \u03b6)\n\nand\n\u03b3(f, z0 ) \u2264\n\n\u03b3(f, \u03b6)\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\u03c8(\u03bd)\n24\n\n\fTherefore,\n\n\u03bd\n\u2264 \u03b10 .\n\u03c8(\u03bd)2\n\n\u03b1(f, z0 ) \u2264\n\nIn order to apply the R\u2212\u03b1\u2212Theorem, we need to show that \u03b2(f, z0 ) \u2264 s0 rz0 .\nLet 0 < t < 1 be real number such that d(z0 , \u03b6) \u2264 tr\u03b6 . Like previously\n\u03b2(f, z0 ) \u2264\n\n1\u2212\u03bd\n1\u2212\u03bd\nd(z0 , \u03b6) \u2264\ntr\u03b6 .\n\u03c8(\u03bd)\n\u03c8(\u03bd)\n\nBy Lemma 4.4\nr\u03b6 \u2264 rz0 + d(z0 , \u03b6) \u2264 rz0 + tr\u03b6\nso that\nr\u03b6 \u2264\nand\n\u03b2(f, z0 ) \u2264\nThis gives \u03b2(f, z0 ) \u2264 s0 rz0 as soon as\n\nr z0\n1\u2212t\n1 \u2212 \u03bd trz0\n.\n\u03c8(\u03bd) 1 \u2212 t\n\n1\u2212\u03bd t\n\u2264 s0\n\u03c8(\u03bd) 1 \u2212 t\nor, equivalently,\nt\u2264\nwhich is given by\nt\u2264\n\ns0\n1\u2212\u03bd\ns0 + \u03c8(\u03bd)\n\ns0\n1\u2212\u03bd0 = t0 \u2243 0.075262346.\ns0 + \u03c8(\u03bd\n0)\n\nWe can now apply the R-\u03b1-theorem (Theorem 1.4):\n\nHence,\n\n\u0012 \u00132k \u22121\n1\nd(zk+1 , zk ) \u2264\n\u03b2(f, z0 ).\n2\n\u0012 \u00132k \u22121\n1\nd(zk , \u03b6) \u2264\n\u03c3\u03b2(f, z0 )\n2\n\n25\n\n\f7\n\nConclusions and suggestions for further research\n\nIn this paper, we gave a generalization of \u03b1-theory for Riemannian (and therefore,\nHermitian) manifolds. This generalization is subtle, due to the influence of new\nintrinsic factors, such as the radius of injectivity of the exponential and the\ncurvature.\nWe developped an intrinsic approach avoiding the use of local charts or isometric imbeddings. Except in the case of submanifolds, such imbeddings are\noften artificial and they lead to high dimensional problems, roughly speaking n3\nfor a dimension n manifold according to Nash's Embedding Theorem.\nOur next objective is to implement this method. It is clear from the examples we have in mind and from the work already done that we have to take into\naccount the data structure describing the considered problem. See for example\nCelledoni-Iserles [3] for Lie group methods, Edelman-Arias-Smith [9] for examples of manifolds described by the action of a group on a set and Adler-DedieuMargulies-Martens-Shub for a product of special orthogonal groups. These three\npapers show three different ways to compute the exponential map associated with\nthe considered manifold and therefore three different ways to implement Newton's\nmethod.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nGregorio Malajovich was partially supported by Brazilian CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico) grant 300925/00-0(NV) and\nby Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Pel\u00facio Ferreira.
