Carbon atoms realize three\nmain hybridization schemes of the valence orbitals: sp3 ,\nsp2 , and sp hybridization. sp3 bonding tends to form\nthree-dimensional networks, as in diamond and the related amorphous structures. sp2 -hybridized orbitals lead\nto two-dimensional networks, at the basis of graphene,\ngraphite, fullerenes, nanotubes, ribbon structures, and\nother forms of wide current interest for their unique mechanical and electronic properties. sp-hybridized carbon forms linear structures (carbynes), which, compared\nto their chemically more stable sp3 (alkanes) and sp2\n(alkenes) hydrogenated counterparts, tend to be rigid,\nthus potentially appealing as backbones for molecular\nnanotechnology.\nCarbynes of increasing length and varied terminations are being synthesized1\u20134 and characterized.5 At\nthe same time, the fabrication of carbon atomic chains\nfrom stretched nanotubes or graphene was achieved by\ncontrolled electron irradiation in transmission electron\nmicroscopes.6\u20138 The remarkable robustness of these carbon chains under irradiation combined with the ease of\nelectron-beam fabrication at the nm scale can provide\na route to the synthesis of actual nano-devices based\non carbynes. Recent investigations have elucidated the\nprominent role of molecular oxygen as a primary source of\nchemical degradation of sp carbon9,10 . In a pure-carbon\nenvironment carbynes are far more stable11\u201315 .\nEffects of longitudinal straining16\u201319 and lateral\nbending20 were investigated very recently by ab-initio\nmethods. The outcome of those studies is that carbyne\nchains are at one time extremely stiff against longitudinal\nstraining and very soft against a bending deformation, to\nthe extent that even extreme bending affects only moderately their bonding properties.20 In the present paper\nwe focus on the mechanical properties of carbynes in the\nperspective of exploiting them as construction materials\nfor nano-engineering. We use ab-initio simulations13,21\n\nr\n\nd\n\nls\nl\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) A beam model used to describe the\nmechanical properties of a sp-carbon chain subject to straining. The scheme represents the relaxed configuration of the\nbeam subjected to four lateral constraints, which induce two\nbending moments on the beam central section, which, as a\nresult, bends as the arc of a circle. We identify the end-toend distance ls of the deformed region; the curvilinear beam\nlength l; the maximum deflection d from straight geometry;\nthe radius of curvature r; and the deflection angle \u03c6.\n\nto predict the stiffness of the carbynes for both longitudinal strain and for bending, and their ultimate tensile\nstrength. The main results of these simulations is that a\nsp carbon chain (and it matters little whether it is of cumulenic \u2013 all double bonds, or polyynic \u2013 with alternating\nsingle-triple bonds) exhibits not only an exceptional mechanical stiffness against longitudinal deformations, but\nalso a small but nonzero rigidity against bending. Accordingly, a Cn chain resembles a thin beam characterized by a finite rigidity against buckling, rather than a\nstring. We find that, e.g., a single-carbyne C8 \"pillar\" can\nwithstand a modest but non-negligible axial compression\nforce \u223c 0.7 nN before buckling.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nIn simulations, one can tune the carbyne length by fixing the position of the end carbon atoms of a selected\nchain section, and leave all other atoms free to relax to\ntheir equilibrium position, compatible with the imposed\n\n\f2\nstrain. As well know to civil engineers, as soon as the\ncompressive stress exceeds a critical value, the straight\nconfiguration of a beam subject to a purely axial strain\n\u03b5 < 0 turns unstable and \"buckles\" spontaneously to a\ncurved arc. In the simulations of highly strained configurations, it is straightforward to address either the\nmetastable straight configuration, or the stable buckled\nconfiguration investigated in Ref. 20.\nTo characterize the mechanical properties of a carbyne\nsegment, and in particular to evaluate the buckling transition, one needs to identify the correct linear-response\nparameteres in a simple model where the effects of different kinds of deformations can be decoupled and studied\nseparately. The simplest continuum model describes a\ncarbyne as a strained thin beam of a homogeneous material, thereby ignoring its discrete atomic structure. Three\nbasic deformations can be applied to the beam: longitudinal traction or compression; lateral bending, as sketched\nin Fig. 1; torsion around its axis. Correspondingly, the\nelastic deformation energy can be decomposed as:\nEel = Etens + Ebend + Etors ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Etens is the tensile energy increase due to longitudinal elongation/shortening, Ebend is the energy due\nto the pure flexion of the beam, and Etors is the energy\nincrease due to the twisting of the beam. Remarkably,\neven this third term is important for the essentially 1D\ncumulenes.13 In the present work we will however mostly\nignore torsion, and concentrate on the first two terms.\nIn the linear-response (small-strain) regime, we write\nthe tensile energy in terms of the strained length l relative\nto the fully relaxed length l0 as\nEtens =\n\n1\u03c7\n2\n(l \u2212 l0 ) ,\n2 l0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c7/l0 is the elastic stiffness of the beam, and \u03c7 is the\nlength-independent beam elastic tension: in the continuum mechanics of 3D solids \u03c7 = E * A, the product of the\nmaterial's elasticity modulus times the beam transverse\narea.\nFigure 1 indicates the relevant geometrical quantities\ncharacterizing the pure-bending deformations of a carbyne of fully relaxed length l0 . In a circular-arc geometry\nensuing from the application of a small bending moment\nM at the beam ends, the bending energy can be derived\nby the linear relation of the deflection angle \u03c6 with the\napplied bending moment:\n\u03c6=\n\nMl\n,\ng\n\n(3)\n\nHere g is the length-independent bending stiffness of the\nbeam: in 3D continuum mechanichs g = E * I, the product of the elasticity modulus times the second moment\nof area of the beam cross section. (The dimension of g\nis force\u00d7area.) For a circular deformation, the bending\nenergy Ebend is therefore\nEbend =\n\n\u03c62\n1\nM\u03c6 = g .\n2\n2l\n\n(4)\n\nIt is convenient to express all quantities in terms of\nclearly defined geometrical quantities, e.g. the distance ls\nbetween the end points of the chain and the the maximum\ndeflection d from straight geometry. We have:\n2d\nls\n\u03c6\nl = \u03c6r =\nls .\n2 sin \u03c62\n\n\u03c6 = 4 arctan\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nWith the implicit substitution of the expressions (5) and\n(6), the elastic energy of the beam stretched and/or bent\nin a circular arc is therefore\nEmech = Etens + Ebend =\n\nIII.\n\n1\u03c7\n\u03c62\n2\n(l \u2212 l0 ) + g .\n2 l0\n2l\n\n(7)\n\nCALCULATIONS\n\nWe determine the linear-response parameters \u03c7 and g\nby means of simulations based on the density functional\ntheory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA).\nThe time-honored LDA is one in many functionals being used for current DFT studies of molecular systems:\nother functionals often improve one or another of the systematic defects of LDA (underestimation of the energy\ngap, small overbinding and overestimation of the vibrational frequencies), but to date no functional is universally accepted to provide systematically better accuracy\nthan LDA for all properties of arbitrary systems. For a\ncovalent system of s and p electrons as the one studied\nhere, LDA is appropriate, and we expect our results to\nchange by a few percent at most if the calculations were\nrepeated using some other popular functional.22\u201324\nWe compute the total adiabatic energies by means of\nthe plane-waves DFT code Quantum Espresso.25 39 We\nconsider the two different limiting structures of carbynes:\npolyynes (or \u03b1\u2212carbynes) with alternating single\u2013triple\nbonds (. . . \u2212C\u2261C\u2212C\u2261C\u2212. . . ), contrasted to cumulenes\nor \u03b2\u2212carbynes, with nearly-equal-length (double) bonds\n(. . . =C=C=. . . ). A typical polyynic chain is obtained\nwhen each end carbon atom forms a single bond with a\nligand (e.g. a hydrogen atom, as in diacetylene), while\na typical cumulene is obtained when each end carbon\nforms a double bond, for example to a CH2 group, as in\nethylene.\nWe focus on a C8 chain segment, and compare its mechanical response in its HC2 -C8 -C2 H polyynic and H2 CC8 -CH2 cumulenic realizations. For the polyyne, we select hydrogenacetylide terminations rather than a single\nhydrogen because the HC2 - group allows us to impose\na bending moment at the ends of the C8 chain as in\nFig. 1, by displacing a C atom along the chain continuation rather, than a chemically different H atom, thereby\nprobing the intrinsic properties of carbyne, rather than\nthose of a specifically-terminated compound. We also\nconsider Cn polyyne of different lengths, to check for\nsize effects, and a 90\u25e6 end-twisted C8 cumulene, which\n\n\f3\n\n2 l Ebend [eV nm]\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\nfree to buckle\n\n-0.01\n\n\u03b5crit\n\n0.02\n\ncumulene (in-plane bending)\npolyyne\n0\n\nstrain \u03b5\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The DFT-LDA tensile excess energy\ncomputed for the strained straight HC2 -C8 -C2 H polyyne (bullets), as a function of \u03b5 = (l\u2212l0 )/l0 .

The very similar data and fit for\nthe cumulene H2 C-C8 -CH2 is not reported for clarity's sake.\n\nwe must treat within the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) since twisting induces a peculiar total spin1 electronic state, with a twofold-degenerate level occupied by two parallel-spin electrons.13 We do not attempt\nany serious size scaling, for two main reasons: (i) very\nlong carbynes are mechanically unstable (thus unsuitable\nfor nanomechanical applications) anyway, and (ii) the\nlong-range interaction effects demonstrated recently17\nwould make a proper ab-initio size-scaling determination\nof the mechanical (in particular bending) properties of\nlong carbynes prohibitively expensive. In the present\nwork we do not deal with the exotic odd-n Cn chains,\nwhich are chemically less stable and more difficult to\nsynthesize.26,27\nTo evaluate \u03c7, starting from the fully relaxed carbyne\nwe stretch or compress a straight C8 chain section by fixing the positions of the end carbon atoms, and letting all\nother atoms free to relax to their resulting equilibrium\npositions under stress. We extract an estimate of \u03c7 by\nfitting Eq. (2) to the resulting values of the excess energy as a function of the chain elongation, as reported in\nFig. 2.\nTo evaluate the bending stiffness g, we force the chain\nto bend by imposing a small lateral displacement of\nthe two atoms adjacent to the C8 section of the chain,\nwhile keeping the first and last atom in the chain section bounded to remain laterally undisplaced, following\nthe scheme of Figs. 1 and 3 (inset). We then let all other\ndegrees of freedom (including the axial position of the laterally bounded atoms) of the chain relax. The C8 section\nrelaxes to form a circular arc, which we fit40 to extract\nthe geometrical quantities indicated in Fig. 1.

For a C8 chain section with both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), Fcrit measures the minimum compressive\nforce (with a corresponding strain \u03b5crit = (lscrit \u2212 l0 )/l0 relative to the reported equilibrium length l0 ) that must be applied to\ninduce buckling.\n\nThe resulting elasticity parameters \u03c7 and g are collected in Table I. Despite the different bonding configuration of polyyne and cumulene, the overall longitudinal\nelasticity \u03c7 values are remarkably similar. The value of\n\u03c7 is compatible with a sound velocity vs = (\u03c7/\u03bc)1/2 \u2243\n31.5 km/s for long-wavelength longitudinal vibrations (\u03bc\nis the linear mass density). In view of the long-range\ninteractions demonstrated recently17 , the weak dependence of \u03c7 on the chain length is remarkable. The bending stiffness g is comparatively more sensitive to the\nchain length, see also Fig. 4. If this velocity is used to\nevaluate the highest-frequency Brillouin-zone\u2013boundary\nphonon in a simplest mass-spring chain, one obtains a\nfrequency \u03bdBZb = vs /(\u03c0dCC ) \u2243 79 THz, i.e. a wave number \u223c 2600 cm\u22121 , expectedly slightly above the region of\nthe observed high-frequency Raman and infrared modes\nemerging as the characteristic spectroscopic signatures of\nthe carbynes.12,13,27\u201329\nThe cumulene is anisotropic: one can make it bend either within the molecular plane, as sketched in the inset\nof Fig. 3, or perpendicularly to it, resulting in differently\noriented double bonds30 being perturbed. We find that\nbending is significantly softer for the out-of-plane distortion than for the in-plane one, with a \u223c 5% anisotropy.\nThe proposed cosine expression for the strain energy\ngiven in Eq. (9) of Ref. 20 is compatible with our Eq. (4)\nfor small curvature (although a small amount of longitudinal strain energy is neglected there). The relation g \u2243 dCC Fd obtained based on the average bond\nlength dCC = 129 pm and orientation-dependent bonding strength Fd = 2.54 eV as obtained in Ref. 20 yields\ng = 5.26 10\u22122 nN/(nm)2 , in good agreement with our\nresult, especially with the C12 chain value. This agreement is even more surprising in view of the extreme deformations introduced in Ref. 20, and indicates that the\nlinear-response coefficient of Eq. (4) extends well outside\nits validity region, provided that the cosine espression\n\nEq. (9) of that work is adopted.\nAccording to elementary continuum mechanics,31 the\ncritical axial load that a beam can sustain in its straight\nconfiguration before the onset of the buckling instability\nis given by Euler's formula\nFcrit = \u03c0 2\n\ng\n,\nl2\n\n(8)\n\ncorresponding to a critical strain\n\u03b5crit =\n\nFcrit\ng\nlscrit \u2212 l0\n\u2243\u2212\n\u2243 \u2212\u03c0 2 2 ,\nl0\n\u03c7\n\u03c7l0\n\n(9)\n\nfor a critical sinusoidal lateral deformation profile. By\nsubstituting the computed values for \u03c7 and g, we find\nthat the C8 carbyne sustains a critical strain of nearly\n\u22120.5%, under the action of a critical force of approximately 0.7 nN, before buckling, as reported in Table I.\nThe corresponding critical strain and force for cumulene (in the softer out-of-plane direction) are essentially\nequal. The computed values are relevant when both ends\nof C8 are pinned (hinged, free to rotate), while if both\nends were frozen, the critical force and strain would be\nfour times larger. Likewise, following Eqs. (8) and (9),\nFcrit decays rapidly with size. For example, for C16 ,\nwhose length is approximately 2.15 times that of C8 ,\nFcrit = 0.14 nN, i.e. approximately 20% of the C8 value\nonly. Direct calculation done for the C12 polyyne in HC2 C12 -C2 H agrees with this scaling, with a small deviation\ndue mostly to a smaller value of g, relative to the C8\nvalue (while \u03c7 is practically coinciding, see Table I).\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe find it rather surprising that, despite the presence\nof in principle softer single bonds, the polyynic chain is\nessentially as hard to compress as double-bonds\u2013based\n\n\f5\ncumulene. The same essentially equivalent stiffness of\npolyyne and cumulene is found against bending deformations, but here the result is less unexpected. Even\na maximally twisted cumulene in a high-spin electronic\nstate exhibits very similar mechanical properties, see Table I.\nWe check the obtained buckling critical point for possible effects of chain discreteness or anharmonicity, by running actual simulations. We compare pairs of DFT simulations at fixed strain: one bound to the linear configuration as in Fig. 2, and one starting off in a slightly curved\ngeometry. In the curved simulations, below the buckling instability, the relaxing chain goes back to straight,\nand recovers the same energy and outward force that\nthe chain produces on the pinned end atoms as in the\nstraight calculation. In contrast, above the buckling instability, a curved shape stabilizes, with a net decrease\nin total energy and in the force acting on the pinned\nend atoms. Crosses in Fig. 2 report the fixed-end excess energy of the polyynic chain when allowed to relax\nin a buckled geometry. We find that the actual buckling instability occurs very close to the linear-response\ncontinuum-model value \u03b5crit of Eq. (9). Relaxations near\ninstability are rather delicate, since equilibrium is almost\nindifferent, providing a manifold of almost-equivalent geometrical configurations which give a hard time to the\noptimization algorithm.\nThe present work demonstrates that it is possible to\ngo a long way in describing an immaterialy thin object such as a monoatomic carbon chain with the mechanics of bulk construction elements, not unlike it was\ndone for 2D graphene in Refs. 32,33. Eventually, carbyne chains turn out rigid enough that the 886 pm-long\nfree-standing C8 polyyne can sustain a compressive strain\nof nearly 0.5% before buckling. On the tensile side, we\nextend our calculations well outside the linear-response\nregion, to estimate the ultimate tensile strength of car-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nW.

The ultimate tension Fult is computed as the maximum force that the carbyne section produces in sustaining an externally imposed longitudinal strain \u03b5ult > 0.\nThe result in the 10 nN region agrees with previous\ndeterminations17,34 (but disagrees significantly with the\nTersoff-Brenner\u2013model determination of Ref. 35), and indicates that a single molecular chain could be used as a\nrope to lift a mass as heavy as one microgram without\nbreaking! If one could pack carbynes with a lateral density of one per A = 0.2\u00d70.2 nm2 cross-section, one would\nobtain a material characterized by a remarkable ultimate\ntensile strength of the order 300 GPa, comparable to that\nof carbon nanotubes.36\nDespite the remarkable mechanical properties of carbynes, their chemical reactivity makes them unsuitable\nto many applications in real world mechanical situations,\nwhere carbon fiber or carbon nanotubes provide superior\nstability with comparable mechanical properties. However in clean well-isolated nano-engineered devices one\ncould envisage that the usage of Cn chains as structural\nor elastic elements may lead to consistent advantages over\ntraditional solutions. For example, the soft bending degree of freedom could be exploited for the construction of\nsensitive accelerometers. Indeed, according to our evaluation of g, a 0.1 \u03bcg mass hanging at the end of a 37 nmlong C30 chain (with the other end bonded to a fixed\nsubstrate) would deflect laterally by as much as 1 nm\nunder an acceleration of 0.01 m s\u22122 , i.e. one thousandth\nof the Earth gravitational field.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge useful discussion with G.
