For example, the study of the black hole entropy provides the\nholographic principle [1], which gives a strong constraint to the property of quantum gravity.\nThe microscopic properties of black holes are also intensively investigated from the viewpoint of\nstring theory. For example, many black hole (or brane) solutions are known in the low energy\neffective theory of the superstring theory. In particular, for BPS saturated solutions of Type II\n(or Type I) supergravity, it is well known that there is a correspondence between the classical\nsolutions and the systems of the BPS D-branes [2]. In this sense, it is natural to assume that\nthere is a stringy origin for a general classical solution of Type II supergravity, even for non-BPS\nsystems.\nIn our previous paper [3], we treated a general classical solution of Type II supergravity\nwith the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p), which is called as the \"three-parameter solution\"\n[4]. The solution had been thought to be the low energy counterpart of the DpD\u0304p-brane system\nwith a constant tachyon profile (vacuum expectation value (VEV)), where the three parameters\nhad been supposed to correspond to the number of the D-branes, that of the anti D-branes\nand the VEV of the tachyon field [5, 6]. In [3], however, we re-examined this correspondence\nand found that the above conjecture is not correct and the three-parameter solution is the low\nenergy counterpart of the DpD\u0304p-brane system with a constant tachyon VEV only if one of the\nthree parameters, c1 , is tuned to zero.\nIn this paper, we consider the stringy interpretation of missing c1 and give some explicit\nexamples of the stringy counterparts of the three-parameter solution. As we mentioned in the\nprevious paper [3], c1 is related to the \"dilaton charge\", which characterizes the asymptotic\nbehavior of the dilaton field. It is well known that black holes with horizons do not have the\ndilaton charge in general, which is supported by the no-hair theorem, but some exceptions are\nknown [2, 7, 8] and we have not understood this phenomena systematically [9]. One of the\npurposes of this paper is to give an approach to this problem from the microscopic (string\ntheoretical) point of view.\nOur strategy is making use of the known correspondence between the BPS black p-brane\nsolution in the supergravity and the BPS Dp-branes in the string theory, and extending this\ncorrespondence by appropriately deforming the both sides. On the supergravity side, this leads\nto a new characterization of the solution. We will find that the BPS limit of the three-parameter\nsolution consists of two extremal limit, that is, the ordinary BPS condition and the condition\n2\n\n\fthat the dilaton charge is proportional to the ADM mass. Then, the three-parameter solution\nis characterized by two non-extremality parameters (and the RR-charge). In particular, the\nparameter c1 is related to the second non-extremality. On the string theory side, we will formally deform the boundary state for the BPS Dp-brane, which respects the same symmetry\nof the three-parameter solution. By evaluating the long distance behavior of the solution of\nthe supergravity and the massless emission from the deformed boundary state, we will directly\ncompare the (microscopic) deformation parameters of the boundary state and the (macroscopic)\nparameters in the three-parameter solution. From this analysis, we show that the first kind of\nnon-extremality corresponds to the non-BPS nature, while the second kind (hence c1 ) is related\nto the deformation of the boundary condition from the ordinary Neumann/Dirichlet one.\nAs examples of the deformed boundary states, we consider three systems of D-branes. The\nfirst one is the system we consider in [3], which possesses only the first non-extremality since\nthe DpD\u0304p-system follows the ordinary boundary condition, that is, the Neumann boundary condition for the longitudinal directions and the Dirichlet boundary condition for the transverse\ndirections. The second and the third example are systems of unstable D9-branes and unstable\nD-instantons, respectively, with an appropriate tachyon condensation to the BPS Dp-branes,\nwhich actually have non-trivial dilaton charges, i.e. non-zero value of c1 . They possess the\ndeformation of the boundary condition for the worldsheet, which represent in some sense fuzziness in transverse or longitudinal directions, respectively. From these examples, we discuss\nthat deformed boundary states which respect the symmetry of the three-parameter solution can\nbe obtained by considering DpD\u0304p-systems on which tachyonic and/or massive excitations are\nturned, in general.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we review the threeparameter solution and we propose a new characterization of the solution in terms of two nonextremality parameters. In the section 3, we give the string theoretical interpretation to the\nparameter c1 and give three examples of the deformed boundary states. The section 4 is devoted\nto the conclusions and discussions.\n\n2\n\nThe Three-Parameter Solution and Non-Extremalities\n\nIn this section, we first give a short review of the three-parameter solution. Then, by investigating the BPS limit of the solution, we propose a new characterization of the solution in terms\nof two non-extremality parameters.\nFirst of all, we consider Type II supergravity in the following setting:\n3\n\n\f\u2022 Assume a fixed, (p + 1)-dimensional object as a source carrying only RR (p + 1)-form\ncharge.\n\u2022 Spacetime has the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p) and it is asymptotically flat.\nNote that these ansatzes are the same as those for the BPS black p-brane solution (we will\nconsider the region 0 \u2264 p \u2264 6 in this paper). Under these conditions, it is sufficient to consider\nthe metric, the dilaton and the RR (p + 1)-form field. The relevant part of the ten-dimensional\naction (in the Einstein frame) is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n3\u2212p\n1\n1\n1\n2\n10 \u221a\n\u03c6\n2\ne 2 |Fp+2 | ,\nS = 2 d x \u2212g R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6) \u2212\n2\u03ba\n2\n2(p + 2)!\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere F(p+2) denotes the (p + 2)-form field strength which is related to the (p + 1)-form potential\nof the RR-field A(p+1) as F(p+2) = dA(p+1) . According to the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p),\nwe should impose the following ansatz,\nds2 = gM N dxM dxN\n= e2A(r) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2B(r) \u03b4ij dxi dxj\n= e2A(r) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2B(r) (dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92(8\u2212p) ),\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(r),\nA(p+1) = e\u039b(r) dx0 \u2227 dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxp ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere M = (\u03bc, i), \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, * * * , p are indices of the longitudinal directions of the p-brane,\n\ni, j = p + 1, * * * , 9 express the orthogonal directions, and r 2 = xi xi .\n\nThe authors of [4] gave a general solution of Type II supergravity of this system.

As we mentioned in Sec.1, we will discuss the BPS black p-brane limit of the\n\nthree-parameter solution and in order to take that limit consistently, we must choose one of the\ntwo branches,\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2r 7\u2212p \u2265 0, c2 > 0 : branch I+ ,\n0\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3r 7\u2212p \u2264 0, c2 < 0 : branch I\u2212 .\n0\n\n(2.15)\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the gravity theory, the three-parameter solution describes charged\ndilatonic black objects. Thus, the RR-charge Q, the ADM mass M and the dilaton charge\nD are natural quantities to characterize the solution. For convenience, we consider wrapping\nthe spatial worldvolume directions on a torus T p of volume Vp . The RR-charge is given by an\nappropriate surface integral over the sphere-at-infinity in the transverse directions [5, 10];\n\n2\n\n|Q| = 2(c22 \u2212 1)1/2 kNp r07\u2212p ,\n\nWe have labeled c3 of [4] as c2 and k as \u2212k according to [5].\n\n5\n\n(2.16)\n\n\fwhere\nNp \u2261\nand \u03c9d =\n\n2\u03c0 (d+1)/2\n\u0393((d+1)/2)\n\n(8 \u2212 p)(7 \u2212 p)\u03c98\u2212p Vp\n,\n16\u03ba2\n\n(2.17)\n\nis the volume of the unit sphere S d .

As we referred in [3], the dilaton\ncharge is a familiar quantity in the general relativity [14, 15, 16, 17] and it has been investigated\nfor a long time in various contexts, for example, the no-hair theorem [18], the cosmic censorship,\nthe scalar field collapse [19]. It is well known that the existence of the dilaton charge would\nchange the structures of spacetimes drastically [16, 9, 20] and generally cause naked singularities\nto appear4 . The extensions to the higher-dimensional theories [21] or the stabilities of such\nsingular spacetimes have been also investigated by many authors [22, 23]. In spite of those\ninvestigations, we have not systematically understood the relation between the horizon and the\ndilaton charge, for example, what kind of the dilaton couplings to the RR-charge can avoid to\nmake a spacetime singular.\nSince the three-parameter solution is the most general solution with the symmetry ISO(1, p)\u00d7\nSO(9 \u2212 p), it naturally includes the BPS black p-brane solution;\nds2 = f (r)\u2212\ne\u03c6 (r) = f (r)\n\n3\n4\n\n7\u2212p\n8\n\n3\u2212p\n4\n\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + f (r)\n\np+1\n8\n\n\u03b4ij dxi dxj ,\n\n,\n\n(2.22)\n(2.23)\n\n\u0001\ne\u039b(r) = \u2212\u03b7 f (r)\u22121 \u2212 1 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\nTheir original definition is in the string frame but here we define it in the Einstein frame in the same manner.\nThere are some exceptions which have horizons even if there is non-zero dilaton charge [7, 8, 2] as we mentioned\n\nin the introduction. These solutions may be related not to the three-parameter solution, but to the four-parameter\nsolution. The three-parameter and the four-parameter solution coincide with each other in the case of D = 4 and\np = 0, so they are not distinguishable in such a case. We will discuss the relation between the condition of the\nformation of horizons and the parameters of the supergravity solutions in the forthcoming paper.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere\nf (r) = 1 +\n\n\u03bc0\n.\nr 7\u2212p\n\n(2.25)\n\nNote that \u03bc0 is the only parameter of the solution, and therefore, all the quantities are labeled\nby it as\n|Q| = M = Np \u03bc0 ,\n\nD=\n\n3\u2212p\nNp \u03bc 0 ,\n4\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 takes an arbitrary non-negative value. In this paper, we will restrict ourselves to the\ncharged case, i.e., \u03bc0 > 0.\nAs we claimed in [3], the parametrization by (c1 , c2 , r0 ) is not suitable to take the BPS limit,\nand so we defined a set of parameters (c1 , \u03bc0 , \u03bd) which was defined by\nr07\u2212p \u2261\n\n\u03bd\u03bc0\n,\n2k\n\nc22 \u2212 1 \u2261\n\n1\n.\n\u03bd2\n\n(2.27)\n\nThe domain of \u03bd becomes\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20 \u2264 \u03bd < \u221e\n\nfor the branch I+ ,\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u2212\u221e < \u03bd \u2264 0 for the branch I\u2212 ,\n\n(2.28)\n\nsince we choose c1 \u2265 0, k \u2265 0 and \u03bc0 > 0. Using these parameters, the RR-charge, the ADM\nmass and the dilaton charge are rewritten as\n|Q| = Np \u03bc0 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012p\nc\n\u03bd\n3\n\u2212\np\n1\nNp \u03bc 0 ,\n1 + \u03bd2 +\nM=\n4\nk\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3 \u2212 pp\nc1 \u03bd\n3\u2212p\n(p + 1)(7 \u2212 p) c1 \u03bd\n2\nD=\nM\u2212\nNp \u03bc 0 .\nNp \u03bc 0 =\n1+\u03bd \u2212\n4\n4\nk\n4\nk\n\n(2.29)\n(2.30)\n(2.31)\n\nThen, it is easy to show that the three-parameter solution (2.3)\u2013(2.6) reduces to the BPS\nblack p-brane solution (2.22)\u2013(2.24) in the limit \u03bd \u2192 0 for arbitrary values of c1 and \u03bc0 . Since |Q|\n\nis unchanged in this limit, we can set \u03bc0 to the same value as the black p-brane5 . We emphasize\nhere that since there are three parameters, the BPS limit consists of two extremal limits, i.e.\nM = |Q| and D =\n\n3\u2212p\n4 M.\n\nThe former is the ordinary BPS condition, which guarantees the\n\npreservation of the spacetime supersymmetry. Although the latter says that the dilaton charge\nis proportional to the ADM mass, its physical meaning is obscure at this stage. Nevertheless, if\nwe take the BPS limit as a starting point, it is quite natural to characterize the solution by two\nnon-extremality parameters, that represent the deviation from the BPS black p-brane solution.\n5\n\nFor the neutral case, i.e., |Q| = 0, another parametrization is suitable.\n\n7\n\n\fFrom this observation, we introduce following quantities m and d defined by\np\n\n1 + \u03bd 2,\nc1 \u03bd\n,\nd=\nk\n\nm=\n\n(2.32)\n(2.33)\n\nwhich are related to the quantities above as\n|Q| = Np \u03bc0 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\u2212p\nd Np \u03bc 0 ,\nM = m+\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u2212p\n(p + 1)(7 \u2212 p)\nD=\nm\u2212\nd Np \u03bc0 .\n4\n16\nThe region of these quantities are determined as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2m \u2265 1, d \u2265 0 for the branch I+ ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3m \u2265 1, d \u2264 0 for the branch I\u2212 .\n\n(2.34)\n(2.35)\n(2.36)\n\n(2.37)\n\nThe BPS solution lies in m = 1 and d = 0 in the overlap of I+ and I\u2212 . Note that the ADM mass\nand the dilaton charge are not conserved Noether charges and are frame-dependent quantities.\nAlthough their definition is ambiguous in some sense, they can characterize the deviation from\nthe Minkowski space. On the other hand, our quantities m and d represent the deviation from\nthe BPS black p-brane solution. As opposed to the ADM mass M , m is always greater than\n1. Hence, m can be considered as a non-extremality parameter in the ordinary sense, while d\ndenotes the difference between the ADM mass M and the dilaton charge D. Note that d is\nrelated to the parameter c1 directly. As we have shown in [3], the three-parameter solution with\nc1 = 0 denotes the spacetime which is produced from the DpD\u0304p-brane system with a constant\ntachyon VEV. Since a main purpose of this paper is to clarify the stringy meaning of c1 , our\ntask is to find sources in the string theory which produces d 6= 0 structure.\nAt the end of this section, we give the long distance behavior of the three-parameter solution\n(2.3)\u2013(2.6), which is given by the leading term of 1/r expansion. In terms of (\u03bc0 , m, d) it is given\nby\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03bc0\n3\u2212p\n7\u2212p\n2(7\u2212p)\n,\nd\n1/r\n+\nO\nm+\ne\n=1\u2212\n8\n4\nr 7\u2212p\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\n\u0010\np+1\n\u03bc0\n3\u2212p\n2(7\u2212p)\ne2B(r) = 1 +\nd\n,\n+\nO\n1/r\nm+\n8\n4\nr 7\u2212p\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03bc0\n(p + 1)(7 \u2212 p)\n3\u2212p\n2(7\u2212p)\n,\nm\u2212\nd\n+\nO\n1/r\n\u03c6(r) =\n4\n16\nr 7\u2212p\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03bc0\ne\u039b(r) = \u03b7 7\u2212p + O 1/r 2(7\u2212p) .\nr\n2A(r)\n\n8\n\n(2.38)\n(2.39)\n(2.40)\n(2.41)\n\n\fWe will compare them with the massless emission from the source in the string theory in the\nnext section.\n\n3\n\nExcitations on the DpD\u0304p-brane System\n\nIn this section, we investigate stringy counterparts of the three-parameter solution. We argue\nthat the geometry expressed by the three-parameter solution is made by D-brane systems which\nare in general sources of closed strings in the bulk. We stress that we only consider static\nsources and do not take into account interactions of open strings on the D-brane. Therefore\nthey can be consistent sources of supergravity fields, even if they are unstable system. As a first\nstep, we deform the boundary state for BPS Dp-branes appropriately, and compare the long\ndistance behavior of the solution with the massless emissions from them. And then, we give\nsome examples.\n\n3.1\n\nDeformations of Boundary States\n\nTo obtain the three-parameter solution, we have required that the solution has the symmetry\nISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p) and it carries a RR (p + 1)-form charge as explained in the previous\nsection. Therefore the source of closed strings, which produces the three-parameter solution,\nshould respect the following restrictions at least in the low energy regime;\n1)\n\nhas the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p),\n\n2)\n\ncarries only the RR (p + 1)-form charge,\n\n3)\n\nhas the \u03b4-function distribution in the transverse space.\n\n(3.1)\n\nNote that the third condition can be slightly relaxed (see below).\nNeedless to say, the system of coincident BPS Dp-branes is such an example. N BPS Dpbranes are expressed by the boundary state,\n\nwith6\n| Bp iNS(RR)\n6\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n| Dp i = PGSO N | Bp iNS + N | Bp iRR ,\n#\n\" \u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX1\nTp\neN\np\u03bc = 0, xi = 0\nbM\neN\nexp \u2212\n\u03b1M SM N \u03b1\n=\n\u2212r SM N b\u2212r\n\u2212n + i\n2\nn \u2212n\n\n(3.2)\n\nNS(RR)\n\n,\n\nr>0\n\nn=1\n\nIn this expression, we have omitted the label \"+\" of the spin structure.\n\n9\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhere Tp is the tension for a single Dp-brane, \u03bc = 0, 1, * * * , p are the directions longitudinal to\n\nthe worldvolume, i = p + 1, * * * , 9 are the directions transverse to the Dp-branes, and \u03b1M\n\u2212n and\nbM (e\n\u03b1M and ebM ) are the creation operators of the modes of the left-moving (right-moving)\n\u2212r\n\n\u2212n\n\n\u2212r\n\nworldsheet bosons and fermions, respectively. SM N = diag (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\u03b4ij ) gives Neumann (Dirichlet)\n\nboundary conditions on the string worldsheet in \u03bc(i) directions, respectively. Here the number\nof the Dp-branes N is the only microscopic parameter. In this case, it is shown that massless\nemission from this boundary state agrees with the long distance behavior of the BPS black\np-brane [24] under the identification,\n\u03bc0 =\n\n2\u03baN Tp\n,\n(7 \u2212 p)\u03c98\u2212p\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhich relates the macroscopic parameter \u03bc0 with the microscopic parameter N . Of course, the\nsystem with N\u0304 D\u0304p-brane also satisfies the same ansatz, which is simply given by replacing N\nto \u2212N\u0304 in the RR-sector of (3.2)7 . We can also consider the system with N Dp-branes and N\u0304\nD\u0304p-branes without tachyon field which is given by the linear combination of the both above.\nWe now take the BPS boundary state (3.2) as the starting point as mentioned in Sec.1\nand consider possible deformations of it with keeping the ansatzes (3.1), which should be the\ncounterpart of the discussion in Sec.2, that is, on the supergravity side. One might try to deform\nit with massless open string excitations on the brane. However, the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7\nSO(9 \u2212 p) prevents the fluctuation of massless scalar fields, and there should be no gauge flux\nsince otherwise it produces other NSNS/RR-charges. Therefore, the excitations on the branes\nshould be at least tachyonic and/or massive8 .\nIn order to make the discussion transparent, we formally deform the boundary state as\nfollows. In the NSNS-sector, we set\n\" \u221e\n#\nX1\nX\nTp\nM (n) N\nM (r) N\n\u2032\ne\u2212n + i\nexp \u2212\n\u03b1\u2212n SM N \u03b1\nb\u2212r SM N b\u2212r p\u03bc = 0, xi = 0\nBp N S = CN\n2\nn\nn=1\nr>0\nwhere\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(n,r)\nSM N = diag A(n,r) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212B (n,r)\u03b4ij .\n\nNS\n\n,\n\n(3.5)\n\n(3.6)\n\nHere A(n,r) , B (n,r) and C are deformation parameters which deform the boundary state without\nchanging its symmetry. When we take A(n,r) = B (n,r) = C = 1, the boundary state (3.3) for\nthe N BPS Dp-branes is reproduced. We also deform the RR-sector of the boundary state (3.3)\nas the same manner but C = 1 in this case since we fix the RR-charge to be the same as the\n7\n8\n\nIn this case, (3.4) is same but \u03b7 replaced by \u22121.\nStrictly speaking, the linear combination of the boundary state and other closed string states is also possible,\n\nbut we do not consider this option.\n\n10\n\n\fN Dp-branes. We give some comments in order. First, one might assume the source object is\na \u03b4-function type located at the origin in the transverse space. But it will turn out to be too\nrestrictive and can be relaxed slightly: the \"width\" of the source allowed to be less than the\nstring length. We will come back to this point in the next subsection. Second, the effect of\n(n,r)\n\n(A(n,r) , B (n,r) ) in SM N is the deformation of the boundary condition. Here we note that only\nthe r = 1/2 mode contributes the massless mode of closed strings emitted from the boundary\n(n)\n\n(r6=1/2)\n\nstate. In other words, the deformations for other modes, SM N and SM N\n\n, are arbitrary in\n\nour analysis below. However, they should be related among them by other consistency, such\nas the modular invariance although we do not discuss them at this stage. Third, C denotes\nthe difference of the overall normalization in the NSNS-sector from that in the RR-sector. For\nexample, in the system of (N + M ) Dp-branes and M D\u0304p-branes, we take CN = N + 2M , the\ntotal number of branes, while the RR-sector has a fixed charge proportional to N .\nThen, we can calculate the massless emissions with momentum pM from this deformed state\nas we have done in [3]. In the NSNS-sector there are the graviton hM N and the dilaton \u03c6, that\nare\nf (p) = h f (p) | \u2206 D \u2032 p = \u2212CN\n\nTp Vp+1 f\n\u01eb\nS (1/2)M N ,\n2 p2i M N\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere | D \u2032 p i denotes the GSO projected deformed state, \u2206 is the closed string propagator and\n\n\u01ebfM N is the appropriate polarization tensor for f = hM N , \u03c6 [3]. There is a similar expression for\nthe RR (p + 1)-form e\u039b . In this case, since we set C = 1 for the RR-sector and since only the\nzero-mode part contributes to the massless fields, we obtain same result as the BPS Dp-brane.\nAfter the Fourier transformation to the position space, we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nC(A + B) 2\u03baN Tp\np+1\n7\u2212p\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03b4ij\n,\nhM N (r) = \u2212\n7\u2212p\n8\n8\n2\n(7 \u2212 p)\u03c98\u2212p r\n2\u03baN Tp\nC\n1\n\u03c6(r) = [\u2212(p + 1)A + (7 \u2212 p)B]\n,\n7\u2212p\n8\n(7 \u2212 p)\u03c98\u2212p r\n2\u03baN Tp\n1\ne\u039b (r) = \u00b1\n,\n(7 \u2212 p)\u03c98\u2212p r 7\u2212p\n\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\nwhere we write A = A(1/2) and B = B (1/2) . Comparing these quantities (3.8)-(3.10) with the\nlong distance behaviors (2.38)-(2.41), we obtain the relation between the macroscopic quantities\nand the microscopic ones as\n2\u03baN Tp\n,\n(7 \u2212 p)\u03c98\u2212p\nC\nm = [(p + 1)A + (7 \u2212 p)B] ,\n8\nC\nd = (A \u2212 B).\n2\n\u03bc0 =\n\n11\n\n(3.11)\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\n\fWe see from the eqs. (3.12) and (3.13) that the two non-extremality parameters m and d in\nthe three-parameter solution correspond to the deformation parameter (A, B, C) on the string\ntheory side. The first non-extremality m 6= 1 can be realized even if A = B = 1, by taking\nC 6= 1. It means that the breaking of the BPS condition can occur within the ordinary boundary\ncondition. However, the second non-extremality d 6= 0 requires necessarily A 6= B. Therefore,\nin order to have the three-parameter solution with nonzero c1 , it is necessary to deform the\nboundary condition from the ordinary one of the BPS Dp-branes so as to satisfy A 6= B. In the\nnext subsection, we give examples of such stringy objects.\n\n3.2\n\nExamples\n\nIn this subsection, we give three typical examples realizing the deformed states in the string\ntheory which we referred in the previous subsection by considering various types of the tachyon\ncondensation. The first example is the case considered in [3]. The other two examples are obtained from the tachyon condensation from higher/lower dimensional unstable D-brane systems.\nIn general, deformations are interpreted as tachyonic/massive excitations on the DpD\u0304p system.\n3.2.1\n\nCase 1: DpD\u0304p system with a tachyon VEV\n\nThe first example is the DpD\u0304p system with a constant tachyon profile. To be precise we consider\nthe (N + M ) Dp-branes and M D\u0304p-branes. The gauge symmetry of the worldvolume theory is\nU (N +M )\u00d7U (M ) and there is a complex tachyon field T (x) in the bi-fundamental representation\nof the gauge group. Here we consider the case where the M DpD\u0304p-pairs vanish and N Dp-branes\nremain. Namely, we decompose the M \u00d7 (N + M ) matrix by M \u00d7 N and M \u00d7 M components\nand set the tachyon profile as\n\uf8eb\n\nT (x) = \uf8ed\n\n0\nt\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere t is a constant M \u00d7M matrix. Note that other open string excitations, such as gauge fields,\nmassless scalar fields and a non-constant tachyon, break the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p).\nIt is known that this system can be expressed by the off-shell boundary state on which the\nboundary interaction for the tachyon field is turned [25, 26]. For our case, the NSNS-sector of\nthe boundary state is then given by\nh\niT\nP\nP\n1 M\nM\n2\neN\np \u2212 \u221e\neN\n\u2212n +i\nn=1 n \u03b1\u2212n SM N \u03b1\nr>0 b\u2212r SM N b\u2212r p = 0, xi = 0\ne\nBp\u2032 ; t NS = N + 2TrM e\u2212|t|\n\u03bc\n2\n\n12\n\nNS\n\n,\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fwhere SM N = (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\u03b4ij ) and the trace is taken over M \u00d7 M matrices. Note that it is the same\nh\ni\n2\nas (3.3) except for the overall factor, N + 2TrM e\u2212|t| , which simply comes from the tachyon\n2\n\npotential V (T ) \u223c Tre\u2212|T | . It reduces to the N + 2M in the limit |t| \u2192 0, corresponding to the\n\n(N + M ) Dp-branes and M D\u0304p-branes, while reduces to N in the limit |t| \u2192 \u221e, corresponding\nto the N Dp-branes.\nFrom this state, we can read off (A, B, C) by comparing (3.15) with (3.5) as\nA = B = 1,\n\nC =1+\n\n2\n2\nTrM e\u2212|t| .\nN\n\n(3.16)\n\nTherefore, macroscopic quantities m and d are given by\nm=1+\n\n2\n2\nTrM e\u2212|t| ,\nN\n\nd = 0.\n\n(3.17)\n\nWe see that the constant tachyon t only contributes to the ADM mass. Therefore, this system corresponds to at most two-parameter subset of the full three-parameter solution as we\nmentioned in [3], but it is an trivial example for our present purpose.\n3.2.2\n\nCase 2: Unstable D9-branes to BPS Dp-branes\n\nNext example is the tachyon condensation from unstable D9-branes to the BPS Dp-branes. For\nsimplicity, we consider Type IIB superstring theory, that is, the tachyon condensation from pairs\nof D9-branes and D\u03049-branes to BPS Dp-branes. For Type IIA superstring theory, we start from\nnon-BPS D9-branes and the discussion is completely parallel. Since a single BPS Dp-brane is\nobtained from a pair of D(p+2)-brane and D\u0304(p+2)-brane, it is clear that it is obtained from 2\npairs of D9-brane and D\u03049-brane via the tachyon condensation. Then let us consider N \u00d7 2\n\n7\u2212p\n2\n7\u2212p\n2\n\npairs of D9D\u03049-branes and the tachyon profile,\nT (x) = u\u03b3i xi \u2297 1N ,\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere i = p+1, * * * , 9 are the transverse directions to the resulting Dp-brane, \u03b3i are the SO(9\u2212p)\ngamma matrices and u is a real parameter of dimension of mass. It is known that this system\nreduces to N BPS Dp-branes in the limit u \u2192 \u221e9 . If we replace T to \u2212T , the final state\nbecomes D\u0304p-branes.\nHere the effect of the tachyon profile (3.18) with u 6= 0 is twofold: First, it breaks the original\nglobal symmetry ISO(1, 9) down to ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p). Next, it produces the correct RRcharge of N Dp-branes which is independent of the value of u. Therefore, this system satisfies\n9\n\nFor details we refer the literatures, which discussed in the context of the worldvolume field theory [27], of the\n\nboundary string field theory [25][28] and of the boundary state [26].\n\n13\n\n\fthe first two items of the ansatzes (3.1) for an arbitrary value of u 6= 0. However, accurately\nspeaking, it does not satisfy the third item. In fact, the intermediate state (0 < u < \u221e)\nis neither D9-branes nor Dp-branes but its energy density in the transverse direction has the\nGaussian-shaped distribution with a width \u223c 1/u. (This is easily seen by noting the tachyon\n\npotential has the form V (T ) \u223c e\u2212u\n\n2 xi x\n\n.) Therefore, if we allow the width of the source less than\n\u221a\nthe string length, u should be sufficiently larger than 1/ \u03b1\u2032 . We will evaluate it more precisely\ni\n\nbelow.\nThis system is again described by the off-shell boundary state of the D9D\u03049 system with the\ntachyon profile (3.18) turned on [26]. It is given by in the NSNS-sector,\nZ\nR\nT9\n\u2032\nb db\u03c3M(b\u03c3) XM\nBp ; u NS =\n[dXM ]TrPe\n,\nNS\n2\nwith\n\n\uf8eb\n\nM=\uf8ed\n\n0\n\nT (X)\n\nT \u2020 (X)\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(3.19)\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere T9 is the tension of a single D9-brane, T (x) is given by (3.18) and the trace is taken over\nthe Chan-Paton space of size 2\n\n9\u2212p\n2\n\nN . It represents the Neumann boundary state with arbitrary\n\nnumbers of tachyon vertex operators attached. By evaluating the path integral and rewriting it\nwith oscillators, we obtain (see Appendix for more details)\nBp\u2032 ; u\n\nNS\n\nTp \u2212 12 R Pi DPi\nP\u03bc = 0, Xi = 0 NS\n(3.21)\ne 4u\n2\nZ\nP \u221e 1 M (n) N\nP\np2\ni\nTp\nM (r) eN\n=N F (y)9\u2212p e\u2212 n=1 n \u03b1\u2212n SM N \u03b1e \u2212n +i r>0 b\u2212r SM N b\u2212r dpi e\u2212 8\u03c0u2 | p\u03bc = 0, pi iNS ,\n2\n(3.22)\n=N\n\nwhere y \u2261 4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 u2 is a dimensionless parameter, and the function F (y) is given by\n4y y 1/2 \u03932 (y)\nF (y) \u2261 \u221a\n,\n4\u03c0\u0393(2y)\nand\n(n)\nSM N\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ny\u2212n\n\u03b4ij ,\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\ny+n\n\n(r)\nSM N\n\n=\n\n(3.23)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ny\u2212r\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\n\u03b4ij .\ny+r\n\n(3.24)\n\nThe corresponding state for the RR-sector is similarly obtained.\nIt is instructive to see the behavior of this state under the change of the value u (0 < u < \u221e).\nFirst of all, we can identify the state (3.22) with the deformed state (3.5) (apart from the zeromode part) as\nA(n,r) = 1,\n\nB (n) =\n\ny\u2212n\n,\ny+n\n\nB (r) =\n14\n\ny\u2212r\n,\ny+r\n\nC = F (y)9\u2212p .\n\n(3.25)\n\n\f4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Profile of F (y). The behavior of this function is the same as that of C, that is, C \u2192 \u221e\nfor y \u2192 0 and C \u2192 1 for y \u2192 \u221e.\nA(n,r) is independent of y, which means that the tangential directions always satisfy the Neumann\nboundary condition. On the other hand, B (n,r) is a monotonically increasing function of y,\nstarting from \u22121 (Neumann) at y = 0 and goes to 1 (Dirichlet) at y \u2192 \u221e. It means that the\ntransverse directions satisfy a mixed boundary condition of Dirichlet and Neumann. Roughly\nspeaking, the boundary condition is Dirichlet-like for B (n,r) < 0 and Neumann-like for B (n,r) > 0.\nProbing only by the massless fields, this state has similar feature as the BPS Dp-branes at least\nin the range sufficiently larger than y = 1/2, although other higher modes can be Neumann-like\nin this region. C behaves as a monotonically decreasing function of y with C \u2192 \u221e for y \u2192 0\nand C \u2192 1 for y \u2192 \u221e. (We give the profile of the function F (y) in Fig.1.) Therefore the\neffective tension is always greater than that of the BPS Dp-brane. Although this factor itself\nis not well-behaved at y \u2192 0, combined with the contribution from the zero-mode, we recover\nthe correct tension for the D9-brane (see Appendix). The zero-mode part depends directly on\nu and means the Gaussian-shaped distribution in the transverse with a (width)2 = 1/8\u03c0u2 .\nStrictly speaking, this is excluded from our assumption for the deformed state. However, since\nwe only concern the massless emission, it is enough to demand the delta-function source at the\nlow energy, that is, the value of u such that 1/8\u03c0u2 . \u03b1\u2032 is in fact well-localized in the limit\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. This condition is equivalent to y & 1/2, which is the same region discussed previously.\nWhen the width is the order of the string scale, then the supergravity approximation is no longer\nvalid and the \u03b1\u2032 -correction in the equation of motion and also the source should be taken into\naccount. In this case, the zero-mode factor in (3.22) is nothing but the \u03b1\u2032 -corrected \u03b4-function\nsource considered in [29] in the context of the smearing of the singularity.\n15\n\n\fp=0\np=1\np=2\np=3\np=4\np=5\np=6\nm=1\ny=1\u00902\n\nm\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\ny\n\n-2\n\nFigure 2: Profiles of m's of the unstable D9-branes for various p's.

This gives two-parameter subset of the three-parameter solution, which possesses\nan non-extremal dilaton charge.\nAs a final remark, we note that the deformation here is also regarded as a massive excitation\nof open strings on the BPS Dp-branes, since a tachyonic excitation on the top of the potential\n16\n\n\fFigure 4: The black circle corresponds to the state in the way of the tachyon condensation from\na system of unstable D9-branes to that of BPS D-branes.

On the other hand, if we look it at\nfrom the (true) vacuum (B), it can be regarded as massive excited state.\nis equivalent to the massive excitation from the viewpoint of the bottom (See Fig.4.). In fact,\nthe original expression (3.20) represents the deformation of the D9D\u03049 system by a tachyonic\nexcitation, while in (3.21) the same system is described by the Dp-branes with massive vertex\nR\noperators db\n\u03c3 Pi DPi turned on.\n3.2.3\n\nCase 3: Unstable D-instantons to BPS Dp-branes\n\nThe third example is the tachyon condensation from a system of unstable D-instantons to the\nBPS Dp-branes. In this case, the BPS Dp-branes can be constructed as bound states of infinitely\nmany unstable D-instantons10 . For the concreteness, we consider a system of non-BPS Dinstantons in Type IIA string theory. There are ten scalar fields \u03a6M and a tachyon field T on\nthem. They are regarded as self-adjoint operators acting on the infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace, since the worldvolume is zero-dimensional and the matrix-size is infinite. Then the\nconfiguration representing N BPS Dp-branes is given by\nT = vb\np\u03bc \u2297 \u03b3 \u03bc \u2297 1N ,\n10\n\n\u03a6\u03bc = x\nb\u03bc \u2297 1 \u2297 1N ,\n\n\u03a6i = 0,\n\n(3.27)\n(3.28)\n\nFor details we refer the literatures discussed that issue from the viewpoint of the worldvolume theory\n\n[30][31][32] and from the viewpoint of the boundary state [26].\n\n17\n\n\fwhere x\nb\u03bc and pb\u03bc are operators on a Hilbert space satisfying the canonical commutation relation,\n[b\nx\u03bc , pb\u03bd ] = i\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3.29)\n\n\u03bc = 0, 1, * * * , p are the worldvolume direction and i = p + 1, * * * , 9 are the transverse direction\n\nand \u03b3 \u03bc are Hermitian gamma matrices. v is a real parameter with dimension of length and this\n\nconfiguration becomes an exact solution in the limit v \u2192 \u221e.\nThe intermediate state (0 < v < \u221e) can be interpreted as a (p+1)-dimensional object, which\nhas a fuzzy worldvolume in some sense. This is most easily understood as follows. Recall that\nthe each set of eigenvalues of the scalar fields {\u03a6M } represents the position of each individual\nD-instanton. In the absence of the tachyon profile (v = 0), they are distributed uniformly on the\n(p+1)-dimensional plane, since the spectrum of x\nb\u03bc spans the real axis. Note that they are still the\n\ncollection of the D-instantons. However, if we turn on the tachyon profile (v > 0), D-instantons\nbecome correlated among them. As seen from the tachyon potential V (T ) \u223c Tre\u2212v\n\n2p\nb\u03b1 pb\u03b1\n\n, the\n\nmomentum distribution is localized around the origin of the momentum space with a width\n\u2206p \u223c 1/v. This means (in an appropriate way) that the position of each D-instanton becomes\nuncertain with an amount of \u2206x \u223c v. Then, in the limit v \u2192 \u221e, it becomes \u2206x = \u221e and we\ncannot observe the individual D-instantons and the worldvolume of Dp-brane appears.\nThe off-shell boundary state describing this system is given by the Dirichlet boundary state\nwith the scalar and tachyon fields turned on as the boundary interaction. In the NSNS-sector,\nafter calculating the trace over the Chan-Paton Hilbert space, we have\nZ\nR\n1\n\u03bc 2 \u03bc\nTp\n[dX\u03bc ] e\u2212 4v2 DX D X X\u03bc , Xi = 0 NS ,\nBp\u2032 ; v NS =N\n2\nP \u221e 1 M (n) N\nP\nTp\nM (r) eN\n=N F (y)p+1 e\u2212 n=1 n \u03b1\u2212n SM N \u03b1e \u2212n +i r>0 b\u2212r SM N b\u2212r p\u03bc = 0, xi = 0\n2\n\n(3.30)\nNS\n\n,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere y is a dimensionless parameter y \u2261 v 2 /\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 , F (y) is a function,\n4y y 1/2 \u03932 (y)\nF (y) \u2261 \u221a\n,\n4\u03c0\u0393(2y)\nand\n(m)\nSM N\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ny\u2212m\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\u03b4ij ,\ny+m\n\n(r)\nSM N\n\n=\n\n(3.32)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ny\u2212r\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\u03b4ij ,\ny+r\n\n(3.33)\n\nwhich is very similar to (3.22). Then we can identify this state with the deformed state (3.5)\nwith setting the parameters as\nA(n) =\n\ny\u2212n\n,\ny+n\n\nA(r) =\n\ny\u2212r\n,\ny+r\n\n18\n\nB (n,r) = 1,\n\nC = F (y)p+1 .\n\n(3.34)\n\n\fp=0\np=1\np=2\np=3\np=4\np=5\np=6\nm=1\n\nm\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n\nm\n1.04\n1.03\n1.02\n\n0.5\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\ny\n\n1.01\n\n-0.5\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\ny\n\n0.99\n\nFigure 5: The left figure is the profiles of m's of the system of unstable D-instantons for various\np's. The right one is a close-up of the left one around m = 1. From these figures, it is clear\nthat all m's are always larger than 1 for sufficiently large y and asymptotically approach 1 as y\nincreases.\nNote that the zero-mode part is exactly the delta-function in this case. The boundary condition\nin the worldvolume direction is now deformed to A(n,r) , which connects A(n,r) = \u22121 (Dirichlet)\n\nfor y \u2192 0 and A(n,r) = 1 (Neumann) for y \u2192 \u221e. This is understood more easily from the\nviewpoint of the deformation from the N BPS Dp-branes, that is, the expression (3.30), on\nR\nwhich a massive vertex operator 4v12 DX\u03bc D 2 X\u03bc turned 11 . Since such a vertex operator\n\nmakes the end point of the open string massive, the freely moving endpoint at y \u2192 \u221e becomes\n\nheavier and heavier as y decreases, and finally it is completely frozen in the limit of y \u2192 0. The\nbehavior of C as a function of y is the same as the previous example. Here the divergence at\ny = 0 is reflected simply by the original system has infinite number of non-BPS D-instantons.\nComparing the massless emission from this state and the long range behavior of the threeparameter solution, we can relate the macroscopic to the microscopic quantities as\nm = F (y)p+1\n\n8y \u2212 p + 3\n,\n4(2y + 1)\n\nd = \u2212F (y)p+1\n\n1\n,\n2y + 1\n\n(3.35)\n\nand the profiles of these parameters are depicted in Fig.5 and Fig.6. In this case, one might\nconclude that the description of the supergravity is valid for all region of y since the configuration\nof D-instantons does not seem to break the ansatzes (3.1). However, as shown in Fig. 5, m is\nsmaller than 1 if y is too small, which is out of the parameter region of the three-parameter\nsolution. This means that this system is consistent with the three-parameter solution only\nwhen y is sufficiently large. This would be understood as follows. As mentioned above, when\n11\n\nSee also recent discussions on the relevance of vertex operator here and fuzziness of the worldvolume [33][34].\n\n19\n\n\fd\n1\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\ny\n\n-1\n-2\n-3\n\np=0\np=1\np=2\np=3\np=4\np=5\np=6\n\n-4\n-5\n\nFigure 6: Profiles of d's of the system of unstable D-instantons for various p's. All d's takes\narbitrary negative value.\nv (y) is small, the boundary of open strings on the \"D-brane\" is localized in the tangential\ndirections. From the viewpoint of closed strings, this means that the size of loops that construct\nthe (deformed) boundary state is localized when y is small, that is, the translational invariance\nis spontaneously broken. This is also related to the uncertainty of the position of D-instantons\nin the tangential directions. In order to recover the translational invariance of closed string on\n\u221a\nthe brane, the uncertainty must be far larger than the string scale, \u2206x \u223c v & \u03b1\u2032 , that is,\ny & 1 where m is larger than 1. Since the other non-extremal parameter d is always smaller\nthan 0 (see Fig.6), we conclude that the tachyon condensation from unstable instantons to BPS\nsaturated Dp-branes is expressed by a three-parameter solution in the branch I\u2212 : m \u2265 1, d \u2264 0.\n3.2.4\n\nTachyonic/massive excitation on the DpD\u0304p system\n\nWe have illustrated three types of deformation above. Here we would like to capture the general\nfeature from above examples and discuss a possible generalization.\nFirst, we summarize the three cases. We considered the situation where the RR-charge is\nfixed as the same value as N BPS Dp-branes have. In Case 1, the DpD\u0304p system with an tachyonic\nexcitation gives the three-parameter solution with d = 0 at low energy, which is trivial in some\nsense. In Case 2, we considered the tachyon condensation on the D9D\u03049 system, which gives the\nsolutions with 0 \u2264 d. It is equivalent to the massive excitation on the BPS Dp-branes. On the\nother hand, in Case 3, although the tachyon condensation on the unstable D-instanton system\nis also equivalent to the massive excitation on the BPS Dp-branes, their low energy solutions\nhave d \u2264 0. The difference between Case 2 and Case 3 is the polarization of the massive vertex\n20\n\n\foperators: The bosonic part of the vertex operator\n\nR\n\ndb\n\u03c3 Pi DPi is \u03b4ij\n\nR\n\nd\u03c3\u2202\u03c4 X i \u2202\u03c4 X j , which\n\ndescribes the lowest massive mode of open strings, a rank 2 tensor with zero momentum. On the\nR\nR\nother hand, the vertex operator db\n\u03c3 DX\u03bc D 2 X\u03bc = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd d\u03c3\u2202\u03c3 X \u03bc \u2202\u03c3 X \u03bd + * * * has a longitudinal\n\npolarization. Physically, the effects of transverse (longitudinal) polarization is characterized by\nthe fuzziness of the worldvolume in the transverse (longitudinal) direction, respectively. In the\ncontext of the scattering of massive open strings, their difference is argued for example in [35].\nWe here observe that the difference in the polarization is seen as the sign of d if we probe these\nsystems by massless closed strings.\nNext, we discuss the possible generalization of the process of the tachyon condensation. In\nCase 2 and 3, we have only considered the tachyon condensation to BPS Dp-branes. However,\nwe can also construct a DpD\u0304p system as long as they have the same RR-charge proportional to\nN , Therefore, recalling that a tachyon excitation on a system of unstable D9-branes or unstable\nD-instantons is regarded as a massive excitation on the resulting Dp-branes (see Fig. 4), we can\ncombine the three cases as the DpD\u0304p system with tachyonic and massive excitations. As we have\nseen above, the tachyonic excitation contributes to m and the massive excitations contribute to\nboth m and d. Note that 1 \u2264 m in any case.\nIt is then quite natural to take into account for higher massive excitations. Let us consider\nvertex operators quadratic in X, say,\nZ\nd\u03c3\u2202\u03c4l X i \u2202\u03c4l Xi ,\n\nor\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3\u2202\u03c3l X \u03bc \u2202\u03c3l X\u03bc ,\n\n(3.36)\n\nwith l = 1, 2, * * * . It is easy to show that such an excitation gives rise to the deformation of the\nboundary state in the form (3.5). It follows that they also contribute to the three-parameter\nsolution and gives another trajectory in the (m, d) space. Note that the relation between the\npolarization and the sign of d is unchanged. We can also consider vertex operators with higher\npower in X, unless they break the global symmetry. In this case, the resulting deformed state no\nlonger has the form (3.5) but treating these vertex operators as perturbation, they contribute to\nthe coupling to massless modes of closed strings. In any case, our conclusion is that the DpD\u0304p\nsystem with tachyonic and massive excitations are seen as the three-parameter solution at the\nlow energy.\n\n4\n\nConclusions and Discussions\n\nIn this paper, we discussed the stringy origin of the general solution of Type II supergravity\nwith the symmetry ISO(1, p) \u00d7 SO(9 \u2212 p), which is called as the three-parameter solution.\n21\n\n\fThis solution contains the BPS saturated black p-brane solution in the parameter space, whose\nsource is BPS saturated Dp-branes expressed by a boundary state. We characterized the threeparameter solution in terms of two non-extremality parameter m and d on the supergravity side.\nOn the other hand, we discussed a class of the deformation of the boundary state on the string\nside. Then we determined the relation between the (macroscopic) non-extremality parameters\nof the classical solution and the (microscopic) deformation parameters by extending the correspondence between the BPS black p-brane solution and the boundary state. In particular, we\nshowed that the dilaton charge is related to the deformation of the boundary condition.\nWe gave three examples of deformed boundary states by considering the tachyon condensation. The first example is a DpD\u0304p-brane system with a constant tachyon VEV discussed in\n[3], the second and the third example are the tachyon condensation processes from the unstable D9-branes and the unstable D-instantons to the BPS Dp-branes, respectively. In the latter\ntwo examples, the boundary condition in the longitudinal and the transverse directions are deformed, respectively, then the corresponding classical solution learns to possess a non-trivial\ndilaton charge. We also showed that the deformed systems are generally regarded as tachyonic\nand/or massive excitations of the open strings on DpD\u0304p-brane systems.\nOur method is also applicable to the charge-neutral case and/or more complicated (less\nsymmetric) systems. For example, the intersecting D-brane system is the one with several RRcharges and less global symmetry [36, 37]. Another possible application is the study of the\nrelationship between the stability of the supergravity solution and that of the D-brane system.\nIn this paper, we only consider a static solution, thus the source is also static even if tachyon\nfields are excited. However, if we consider a perturbation from the solution, the unstable modes\nare expected to correspond to tachyonic excitations on the D-branes. This would give the stringy\nmeaning of the instability of the supergravity solutions.\nIt is also interesting to investigate the properties of the dilaton charge further. As we\nrepeated in this paper, the existence of the dilaton charge changes the structures of spacetimes,\nin particular, it generally makes the spacetimes have no horizons. Therefore, the study of the\ndilaton charge from the viewpoint of string theory might lead us to the understanding of the\nmeaning of the horizons from the viewpoint of the string theory. However, since the threeparameter solution does not have the horizon in most region of the parameter space, we will\nhave to treat the four-parameter solution which has the horizon in some parameter region [4, 5],\nin order to play with the most interesting feature of black objects. For this purpose, our strategy\nis expected to be essentially applicable. If we can clarify this issue, it might be possible, for\nexample, to understand the Schwarzschild black hole in terms of the string theory, which would\n22\n\n\fbecome one of the points of contact for the string theory and the general relativity.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank T.

XM (b\nis a boundary interaction and P\n\u03c3 ) and\n\nPM (b\n\u03c3 ) denote the position boundary superfields and the conjugate momentum superfields on\nthe boundary, respectively, and \u03c3\nb = (\u03c3, \u03b8) is the boundary supercoordinate. For notation of the\n\nsuperfields and the supercoordinate, see [38]. For construction of the boundary state, see [39].\nWhen M can be expanded by SO(2m) gamma matrices \u0393I (I = 1, * * * , 2m) as\nM=\n\n2m\nX\nk=0\n\nMI1 ***Ik \u2297 \u0393I1 ***Ik ,\n\n23\n\n(A.3)\n\n\fit is convenient to rewrite the boundary interaction using fermionic superfields as [28]12\n(Z\n!)\nZ\n2m\nX\n\u0002 I\u0003\n1 I\n\u2212Sb\nI\nI1\nIk\nd\u0393 TrP exp\n=\ne\ndb\n\u03c3\n\u0393 D\u0393 +\n.\n(A.4)\nMI1 ***Ik \u0393 * * * \u0393\n4\nk=0\n\nWe fix the measure of the path integral so that the boundary interaction (A.4) gives the number\nof D9-branes in the absence of the tachyon field.\nSuppose N 2(9\u2212p)/2 -pairs of D9-brane and D\u03049-brane and consider the tachyon profile,\nM = u\u0393i Xi \u2297 1N ,\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhere \u0393i (i = p + 1, * * * , 9) are the SO(2(9 \u2212 p)) \u03b3-matrices.

Moreover,\nit is easy to check that this state imposes the Neumann boundary condition for the directions\n\u03bc = 0, * * * , p. Then (A.1) can be written as\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014Z\n1\n\u2032\ndb\n\u03c3 \u2212 2 Pi DPi | Bp iNS ,\nBp ; u NS = N exp\n4u\n\n(A.7)\n\nwhere we determine the constant factor of (A.1) so that | Bp\u2032 ; u iNS becomes the boundary state\ncorresponding to the NSNS-sector of N Dp-branes in the limit of u \u2192 \u221e.\nUsing the explicit expression of Pi (b\n\u03c3 ) by the string oscillators and the zeta-function regularization,\n\u221e\nY\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nb\n\u0393(a + 1)\n= \u221a\n,\nm+a\n2\u03c0b\nm=1\nwe obtain\nBp\u2032 ; u\n\nNS\n\n(A.8)\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n#9\u2212p\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n4y y 1/2 \u03932 (y)\n1\n(r) eN \uf8fb\n(n) N\n\u221a\nbM\n\u03b1\ne +i\nexp \uf8f0\u2212\n\u03b1M S\n\u2212r SM N b\u2212r \u00d7\nn \u2212n M N \u2212n\n4\u03c0\u0393(2y)\nn=1\nr=1/2\nQ\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n9\n2\np\ni=p+1 dpi\nexp \u2212 i 2 | p\u03bc = 0, pi iNS ,\n(y = 4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 u2 )\n(A.9)\n\u00d7\n9\u2212p\n(2\u03c0)\n8\u03c0u\n\nTp\n=N\n2\n\n\"\n\nwith\n(n)\nSM N\n12\n\n\u0393(a + 1/2)\nb\n\u221a\n=\n,\nr+a\n2\u03c0\nr=1/2\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ny\u2212n\n\u03b4ij ,\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\ny+n\n\n(r)\nSM N\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ny\u2212r\n\u03b4ij .\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u2212\ny+r\n\nThe TrP in the second line is necessary when MI1 ***Ik are also matrices.\n\n24\n\n(A.10)\n\n\fWe can easily show that (A.9) correctly becomes the boundary state of the NSNS-sector of the\nN Dp-branes in the limit of u \u2192 \u221e, which is apparent from the original definition (A.7). On\nthe other hand, in the limit of u \u2192 0, (A.9) becomes\nP\u221e\n1 M\nM eM\n(4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 )\u2212(9\u2212p)/2 Tp \u2212 P \u221e\neM\n\u2212n +i\nr=1/2 b\u2212r b\u2212r | p\nn=1 n \u03b1\u2212n \u03b1\ne\nM = 0 iNS .\n2\n(A.11)\n\nBp\u2032 ; u \u2192 0 = 2(9\u2212p)/2 N\n\nSince (4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 )\u2212(9\u2212p)/2 Tp = T9 , (A.9) correctly expresses the tachyon condensation from N 2(9\u2212p)/2 pairs of D9-brane and D\u03049-brane to N Dp-branes.\nFor the RR sector, we can carry out the similar calculation and a deformed boundary state\nlike (A.9) appears, that is, the boundary condition and the zero-mode part is deformed. However,\nin the case of the RR-sector, the normalization factor of the state does not depend on u since the\ncontribution from the bosonic oscillators and the fermionic oscillators completely cancel. This\nleads to the conservation of the RR charge under the tachyon condensation.\n\nA.2\n\nConstruction from D-instantons\n\nNext, we review tachyon condensation of infinitely many non-BPS D-instantons to the N Dpbranes. For detail, see [26].\nIn Type IIA superstring theory, a state corresponding to non-BPS D-instantons with scalar\nprofiles and a tachyon profile is given by\nBp\u2032 = e\u2212Sb (\u03a6\n\n\u03bc ,T )\n\nwhere\nR\n\nb\ne\u2212Sb = TrPe\n\ndb\n\u03c3 M(b\n\u03c3)\n\n,\n\nis a boundary interaction.\n\n\uf8eb\n\nM=\uf8ed\n\n| B(\u22121) iNS ,\n\n\u2212i\u03a6M PM\nT\n\n(A.12)\n\nT\n\u2212i\u03a6M PM\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(A.13)\n\nThe solution that corresponds to N Dp-branes is\nT = vb\np\u03bc \u2297 1N \u2297 \u03b3 \u03bc ,\n\n\u03a6\u03bc = x\nb\u03bc \u2297 1N \u2297 1,\n\n\u03a6i = 0,\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u03bc are gamma matrices, and x\nb\u03bc and pb\u03bc are operators satisfying\n[b\nx\u03bc , pb\u03bd ] = i\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc .\n\n(A.14)\n\n(A.15)\n\nIn the configuration (A.14), the matrix M is decomposed as\nM = (\u2212ib\nx\u03bc P\u03bc ) 1 + (vb\np \u03bc ) \u0393\u03bc ,\n\n25\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u0393\u03bc = \uf8ed\n\n0\n\n\u03b3\u03bc\n\n\u03b3\u03bc\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(A.16)\n\n\fthen it is again convenient to use the boundary fermion as (A.4);\n\u0012\n\u001aZ\n\u0013\u001b\nZ\n1 \u03bc\nb exp\n\u0393 D\u0393\u03bc \u2212 ib\nx\u03bc P\u03bc + (vb\np \u03bc ) \u0393\u03bc\ndb\n\u03c3\ne\u2212Sb = [d\u0393\u03bc ] TrP\n4\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\n\u001aZ\nZ\n1 \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u0393 D\u0393 + ip\u03bc Dx \u2212 ix P\u03bc + vp\u03bc \u0393\ndb\n\u03c3\n= N [d\u0393 dx dp\u03bc ] exp\n4\n\u001aZ\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nZ\n1 \u03bc\n= N [d\u0393\u03bc dx\u03bc ] \u03b4 (Dx\u03bc \u2212 iv\u0393\u03bc ) exp\ndb\n\u03c3\n\u0393 D\u0393\u03bc \u2212 ix\u03bc P\u03bc\n4\n\u0012\n\u001aZ\n\u0013\u001b\nZ\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc 2 \u03bc\ndb\n\u03c3 \u2212iX P\u03bc \u2212 2 DX D X\n= N [dX ] exp\n.\n(A.17)\n4v\nHere we have replaced the operators x\nb\u03bc and pb\u03bc by superfields x\u03bc (b\n\u03c3 ) and p\u03bc (b\n\u03c3 ) in the second\n\nline by adding the kinetic term ip\u03bc Dx\u03bc . Then we performed the functional integral for p\u03bc and\n\u0393\u03bc . In the last line x\u03bc is identified with the superfield X\u03bc on the string worldsheet.
