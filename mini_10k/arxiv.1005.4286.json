Any meaningful theory of gravity should explain the origin of this property. Here we show that the\nbasic holomorphic modes characterising the underlying two dimensional conformal symmetry near the horizon bring about this universality. Moreover these modes lead to a law\nof equipartition of energy for black holes which suggests a statistical origin of gravity. This\nemergent nature of gravity\nis further bolstered by showing the equivalence of entropy with\n\u0001\ni\nthe action S = \u2212 ~ I and expressing the generalised Smarr formula for mass as a therE\nwhere S, E and T are the entropy, energy and temperature,\nmodynamic relation, S = 2T\nrespectively, of a black hole.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the absence of a quantum theory of gravity, semiclassical approaches have become increasingly\npopular and are widely used. Of particular interest is the application of these ideas to black hole\nthermodynamics. Black holes are to gravity what atoms were to atomic physics so that their\nstudy is expected to provide crucial information regarding gravity just as the study of atoms\nwas the pathway to atomic physics. An intriguing aspect is that identical results for black hole\nthermodynamics are obtained by quite contrasting semiclassical methods. It is both remarkable\nas well as ill understood.\nNow another consequence of the repeated failure to quantise gravity has led to a parallel\ndevelopment where the interpretation of gravity as a fundamental force is abandoned and it is\nregarded as an emergent phenomenon like thermodynamics or hydrodynamics [1\u20134]. Hence the\nissue of quantisation of gravity becomes inconsequential. A natural question that arises in this\ncontext is the role of semiclassical methods in interpreting gravity as an emergent phenomenon.\nUnless this is clarified, a self-consistent holistic view of either black holes or gravity is not\npossible.\nIn this essay we address these issues. The results to be used were recently obtained by\nus [4\u201310]. These findings are connected to present a unified picture.\nThe origin of the universality of results lies in the fact that, to an observer outside a black\nhole, the near horizon region is effectively described by a free two dimensional conformal theory\n[11]. Transverse modes, interaction and mass terms are redshifted away relative to degrees of\nfreedom in the (r-t) plane. As we shall show this two dimensional effective theory is able to\nsimultaneously accommodate some of the most widely used semiclassical techniques \u2013 anomaly\nbased [9, 12\u201316], tunneling based [17\u201319] and global embedding [8, 20] \u2013 to analyse black hole\nthermodynamics. The essential thread running through these seemingly disparate approaches\nis the structure of the holomorphic modes characterising the left moving and right moving\nsolutions of the field equation.\nThe same modes are used to concretely develop a statistical formulation highlighting gravity\nas an emergent phenomenon. First, the law of equipartition of energy is derived for black\nholes. Using this, the standard statistical definition of entropy is identified with the action.\nConsequently, extremisation of the action that yields Einstein's equations becomes equivalent\nwith extremisation of entropy. Our analysis naturally leads to a thermodynamical definition of\nenergy (E = 2 T S). This is useful since energy is one of the most conceptually challenging and\ndiversely defined variables in general relativity. This relation is also shown to reproduce the\ngeneralised Smarr formula for mass [21].\n\n2\n\nMode functions and black hole thermodynamics\n\nLet us now concentrate on the effective two dimensional theory near the event horizon. The\nleft (L) and right (R) moving (holomorphic) modes are obtained by solving the appropriate\nfield equation using the geometrical (WKB) ansatz. The modes defined inside and outside the\nhorizon are related by the transformations [5\u20137],\ni\n\n\u03c0\u03c9\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03c0\u03c9\n\n(R)\n\n= e\u2212 ~ \u03c9 uin = e\u2212 ~\u03ba e\u2212 ~ \u03c9 uout = e\u2212 ~\u03ba \u03c6out\n\n(L)\n\n= e\u2212 ~ \u03c9 vin = e\u2212 ~ \u03c9 vout = \u03c6out\n\n\u03c6in\n\n\u03c6in\n\n2\n\n(L)\n\n(R)\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9 is the energy of the particle as measured by an asymptotic\n\u03ba is the surface\n\u0010 observer,\nR dr \u0011\ngravity and u = t \u2212 r\u22c6 , v = t + r\u22c6 are the null tortoise coordinates r\u22c6 = F (r) corresponding\n2\n\nto the 2 \u2212 d metric ds2 = \u2212F (r)dt2 + Fdr(r) . In this convention the L (R) moving modes are\ningoing (outgoing). The results obtained in the tunneling formalism are now easily reproduced.\nConsidering the modes inside the horizon, the left moving modes travel towards the centre of the\nblack hole and their probability to go inside, as measured by an external observer, is expected\n(L)\n\nto be unity. This is easily verified by using (1), P (L) = \u03c6in\n\n2\n\n(L)\n\n= \u03c6out\n\n2\n\n(L)\n\n= 1. Note that \u03c6in is\n\n(L)\n\nrecast in terms of \u03c6out since measurements are done by an external observer. This shows that\nthe left moving (ingoing) mode is trapped inside the black hole, as expected. The right moving\nmode, on the other hand, tunnels through the horizon with a finite probability\n(R)\n\nP (R) = \u03c6in\n\n2\n\n\u03c0\u03c9\n\n(R)\n\n= e\u2212 ~\u03ba \u03c6out\n\n2\n\n= e\u2212\n\n2\u03c0\u03c9\n~\u03ba\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nas measured by an external observer. Exploiting the principle of detailed balance P (R) =\n\u03c9\n~\u03ba\n. Usual tunneling based\ne\u2212 T P (L) immediately leads to the Hawking temperature T = 2\u03c0\nmethods [17, 18] also yield this result but fail to obtain the black body spectrum. This glaring\nomission is filled in the present approach by computing the density matrix using (1) and then\ntracing out the irrelevant ingoing (L) modes [6].\nLet us next consider anomaly based methods. The stress tensor near an evaporating black\nhole is calculated [22] by using precisely the mode functions \u03c6 \u223c\ne\u2212i \u03c9 u , e\u2212i \u03c9 v given in (1). Its\n\u0001\nexplicit form is split into a traceful and traceless part \u0398\u03bc\u03bc = 0 ,\nT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\nR\ng\u03bc\u03bd + \u0398\u03bc\u03bd .\n48\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nR\nsince,\nThe stress tensor is conserved \u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 0 but has a non-vanishing trace T \u03bc\u03bc = 24\u03c0\nsimultaneously, diffeomorphism and conformal invariances cannot be preserved at the quantum\nlevel. This trace anomaly incidentally leads to the Hawking flux as demonstrated long back\nin [12].\nA more recent approach, based on the diffeomorphism anomaly [9,13\u201315], is easily connected\nto this discussion. Since the ingoing (L) modes are trapped within the black hole, the theory near\nthe horizon is interpreted as chiral, having only one sector (R) of the modes. Using a simple\n(R)\n1\nalgebra based on the left-right symmetry the diffeomorphism anomaly \u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 96\u03c0\n\u01eb\u03bd\u03bc \u2207\u03bc R\nfollows immediately from (3) [5]. As shown in [10] this equation is solved subject to a boundary\ncondition that corresponds to implementing the Unruh vacuum. The resulting flux agrees with\nthe expression found by integrating the Hawking black body spectrum.\nYet another way of discussing black hole thermodynamics is to use the correspondance\nbetween Unruh and Hawking effects. In this case the n-dimensional curved space is embedded\nin m (> n) dimensional flat space [20]. This global embedding is quite complicated for an\narbitrary black hole metric. As shown recently [8], restricting to the effective two dimensional\nnear horizon theory simplifies the calculations non-trivially. The crucial point is that, after\nembedding in flat space, the relations (1) between the 'in' and 'out' modes is still preserved,\nalthough the individual form of the modes might differ from the curved space result. The only\ndifference is that the asymptotic energy '\u03c9' in (1) is replaced by the local energy given by the\nTolman relation E(r) = \u03c9 F (r). Following similar steps beginning from (2) it is possible to\n\n3\n\n\f[23]. The Hawking\nderive the black body spectrum with the Unruh temperature TU = \u221a~\u03ba\n2\u03c0 F (r)\np\n~\u03ba\ntemperature is easily deduced from this expression by using T = F (r)TU =\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n3\n\nMode functions and statistical origin of gravity\n\nRecently there has been a growing consensus that gravity is not a fundamental force, rather it is\nan emergent phenomenon [1\u20134]. The fundamental role of gravity is replaced by thermodynamical\ninterpretations. However, understanding the entropic or thermodynamic origin of gravity is far\nfrom complete since the arguments are more heuristic than concrete. We now show that the\nrelations (1) play a crucial role in revealing the statistical origin of gravity.\nFirst, we give a simple derivation of the law of equipartition of energy of black holes. The\naverage value of the energy of a particle, measured from outside, is given by [7],\nZ \u221e\n2\u03c0\u03c9\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 e\u2212 ~\u03ba\n~\u03ba\nh\u03c9i = Z0 \u221e\n=\n=T\n(4)\n2\u03c0\n\u2212 2\u03c0\u03c9\nd\u03c9 e ~\u03ba\n0\n\nwhere we have used (2) and T is the black hole temperature. Now the effective two-dimensional\ncurved metric can always be embedded in a flat space having exactly two space-like coordinates\n[8]. Recall that this type of embedding was discussed at the end of Section 2 in the treatment\nof Unruh radiation vis-a-vis Hawking radiation. Hence, associating two degrees of freedom to a\nparticle, we find that each degree must have an energy equal to T2 . This is just the equipartition\nlaw of energy.\nImagine now that the system is composed of N number of bits corresponding to N degrees of\nfreedom, in which all information is stored, so that N is proportional to the entropy, N = N0 S.\nFrom the equipartition law the total energy of the system is E = 12 NT . Eliminating N, we\nobtain S = N2E\n. To fix N0 let us consider the simplest example, the Schwarzschild black hole\n0T\n4\u03c0M 2\n~\nwith S = ~ , E = M, T = 8\u03c0M\n. This yields N0 = 4. With this normalisation we obtain,\nS=\n\nE\n.\n2T\n\n(5)\n\nNow in statistical physics, entropy is defined as S = ln Z + ET . Expressing the partition function\ni\nas Z = e ~ I and exploiting (5) immediately yields,\ni\nS = \u2212 I.\n(6)\n~\nConsequently the gravity action gets identified with the entropy. Furthermore, using (5), (6)\nand the explicit form of the action, it is possible to prove [4] that the energy E corresponds to\nKomar's definition [24].\nThe relation (5), which was also considered in [4, 25], has a general validity as may be\nexplicitly verified by taking various black hole solutions [4]. Incidentally it is also possible to\ninterpret (5) as defining the energy. For instance, in the Kerr-Newman example, the Komar\nenergy is not known in a closed form. Here if we use the known expressions for S and T , the\nKomar energy comes out as,\nE = M \u2212 QV \u2212 2 J\u03a9\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere the symbols have their usual meaning. If E = 2 T S is re-introduced in (7), we exactly\nreproduce the generalised Smarr formula for mass [4, 21]. The thermodynamic origin of this\nformula is thereby illuminated.\n\n4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nSemiclassical methods, along with other approaches like loop quantum gravity and string theory,\nform the basis for studying black hole thermodynamics. It is reassuring to note that, in the\nsupposed absence of a quantum theory of gravity, the same semiclassical methods are useful\nto study gravity as an emergent phenomenon. The unification of the semiclassical methods,\neventually leading to a concrete statistical origin of gravity shown here, could further illuminate\nthis phenomenon.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
