The next runs at the Fermilab Tevatron have the potential for discovering the Higgs\nboson for a mass range beyond the current LEP limit\n[1]. Remarkable efforts [2] have been devoted to designing the best search strategy for a SM-like Higgs boson,\nwith a large branching into b-jets or W -bosons. However, a Higgs boson, h0 , with SM-like couplings to the\ngauge bosons and fermions, could nevertheless have decay modes dramatically different from the SM ones. The\nreason is that the SM is likely to be a part of a more comprehensive theory which may include an extended Higgs\nsector. It is then possible for the Higgs boson to decay into pairs of other neutral scalars, whenever they are\nlighter than half the h0 mass, Mh .\nAn example of such an extended Higgs sector is given\nby the Minimal Composite Higgs Model (MCHM) [3],\nwhich is based on the top-quark condensation seesaw\nmechanism [4,5]. At low energy, the MCHM includes two\ncomposite Higgs doublets and two gauge-singlet scalars,\nwith the h0 and a CP-odd scalar, A0 , being the lightest scalar mass eigenstates. Another interesting example\nis the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(NMSSM) [6], where the presence of two Higgs doublets\nand a gauge singlet allows a region of parameter space in\nwhich Mh is larger than twice the mass MA of the lightest CP-odd scalar, A0 . Both in the MCHM and NMSSM\nit is natural to have a light A0 because its mass is controlled by the explicit breaking of a spontaneously broken\nU (1) symmetry. In both models this global U (1) symmetry has a QCD anomaly, and therefore A0 is an axion.\nNote though that various axion searches [7] place a lower\nbound on MA , typically in the MeV range, which requires explicit U (1) breaking beyond the QCD anomaly,\nso that A0 does not solve the strong CP problem. In\nother models, such as the chiral supersymmetric models\n[8], or composite Higgs models from extra dimensions [9],\nh0 could also decay into light CP-even scalars.\nIn this Letter we study the Higgs boson decay into CPodd scalar pairs at the upgraded Tevatron. We assume\nthe existence of a scalar A0 (we call it \"axion\" for short),\n\nof mass MA < Mh /2, with a trilinear coupling\ncv 0 0 0\nh A A ,\n(1)\n2\nwhere v \u2248 246 GeV is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, and c is a model-dependent dimensionless parameter, which can be as large as O(1).\nThe Higgs width into a pair of axions is\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nMA2\nc2 v 2\n0\n0 0\n1\u22124 2\n.\n(2)\n\u0393(h \u2192 A A ) =\n32\u03c0Mh\nMh\nThe decay to axion pairs can be essential for Higgs boson searches in collider experiments. This is illustrated\nin Fig. 1, where we plot the Higgs boson branching ratio\nto axions, B(h0 \u2192 A0 A0 ), versus Mh , for MA \u226a Mh /2\nand several values of c. For Mh below the W W threshold, the dominant SM decay of the Higgs boson h0 \u2192 bb\u0304\nhas a very small width, and is therefore susceptible to the\npresence of new physics beyond the SM, e.g. the interaction (1). The decay to axions would then dominate over\nh \u2192 bb\u0304 for values of c as small as \u223c 0.02(Mh/100 GeV).\nWe also see that even above the W W threshold, h0 \u2192\nA0 A0 competes with h0 \u2192 W W , provided c \u223c O(1).\n\nFIG. 1. Branching ratio of the Higgs boson into axion pairs,\nas a function of Mh , for MA \u226a Mh /2 and several values of c.\n\n1\n\n\fExperimental signatures of the Higgs boson.- The final state signatures for h0 \u2192 A0 A0 searches will depend\non the subsequent decays of the axions, which are quite\nmodel-dependent. Here we will concentrate on the case\nwhere the axion couplings to light fermions are negligible. Such a situation may arise in the MCHM, e.g. when\nonly one Higgs doublet is mainly responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion masses (type I\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model with large tan \u03b2 [6]). In the\nMCHM, however, the axion has a large coupling to a\nheavy vector-like quark, \u03c7, whose charges under the SM\ngauge group are the same as for the right-handed top\nquark tR . This coupling allows one-loop decays of the\naxion into gluon or photon pairs. The case where the axion couplings to light fermions are significant (e.g., in the\nNMSSM) provides interesting experimental signatures as\nwell, but we leave its investigation for future studies.\nThe constraints on a light CP-odd scalar with small\ncouplings to SM fermions are loose [3]. For example,\nno constraints on the axion mass have been set from\nZ \u2192 A0 \u03b3 at LEP [10], from direct A0 production through\ngluon fusion via a \u03c7 loop at the Tevatron [11], from fits\nto the electroweak data, or from meson decays [6]. The\nrelevant lower bounds on MA come from beam dump experiments [12], in the MeV range, and from star cooling\nrates, MA >\n\u223c 0.2 MeV [7].\nIn the MCHM, the two Higgs doublets and two gaugesinglet scalars arise as bound states of the top-bottom\nleft-handed doublet or \u03c7L , with \u03c7R or tR . At scales below a few TeV this is an explicit, renormalizable theory\nwith scalars that appear to be fundamental. The Higgs\npotential has been analyzed in detail in [3,5]. For the\npurpose of studying Higgs boson decays in the MCHM\nit is however sufficient to introduce the following simpler\nmodel. Consider the SM with the addition of a gauge\nsinglet complex scalar S and the vector-like quark, \u03c7.\nBesides the kinetic terms and Higgs Yukawa couplings,\nthe following terms are present in the Lagrangian:\nL = \u03beS\u03c7L \u03c7R + h.c. \u2212 V (H, S) ,\n\nthe axion to \u03c7 is essential since otherwise the axion would\nbe stable and the Higgs boson would decay invisibly [13].\nThe h0 A0 A0 coupling may be easily computed in the\nSM+singlet model, with the result\nc=\u2212\n\n\u221a\nhSi\nsin \u03b8 \u2212 \u03bb0 cos \u03b8 ,\n2\u03bbS\nv\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the mixing angle between the two CP-even\nneutral scalars,\n\u221a\n\u2212 2 2\u03bb0 vhSi\n.\n(6)\ntan 2\u03b8 \u2243\n2\u03bbS hSi2 \u2212 \u03bbH v 2 \u2212 CS /hSi\nFor a range of values of the six parameters from Eq. (4),\nthe Higgs decay to axions is important.\nThe effective axion couplings to gluons and photons,\ninduced at one-loop by the \u03c7 quark, are given by\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u2212 2 0 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\nA \u01eb\n\u03b1s G\u03bc\u03bd G\u03c1\u03c3 + Nc e2\u03c7 \u03b1F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03c1\u03c3 , (7)\n16\u03c0hSi\nwhere \u03b1s (\u03b1) is the strong coupling (fine structure) constant, G\u03bc\u03bd (F\u03bc\u03bd ) is the gluon (photon) field strength,\nNc = 3 is the number of colors and e\u03c7 = 2/3 is the electric charge of the vector-like quark. Naively, the dominant axion decay mode is to a pair of gluons. However,\nthe gluons must then hadronize, and for light axions the\nnumber of open channels is very limited. Indeed, the\ntwo-body decays A0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, \u03c0 0 \u03b3 are forbidden by CP invariance and angular momentum conservation, while the\nthree body decays A0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3\u03b3, 2\u03c0 0 \u03b3, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 are significantly suppressed by phase space (note that C- and Pparity need not be separately conserved in axion decays).\nTherefore, for MA <\n\u223c 3m\u03c0 \u2248 405 MeV the branching ratio to two photons is close to 1. The axion decay width\ndue to the two photon effective coupling (7) is given by\n\u0393(A0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) \u2243\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b12 MA3\n.\n72\u03c0 3 hSi2\n\n(8)\n\nFor MA >\n\u223c 0.5 GeV the isospin-violating decay modes\nA0 \u2192 3\u03c0 open up and start to compete with A0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\nDue to QCD uncertainties, it is quite difficult to estimate\ntheir exact width, but recall that the measured branching\nfractions of \u03b7 decays into \u03b3\u03b3, 3\u03c0 0 , and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 are given\nby 39%, 32%, and 23%, respectively [7]. Since \u03b7 and A0\nhave the same quantum numbers, the A0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay\nmode is likely to be significant even for MA of order 1\nGeV. Fortunately, the study of the h0 \u2192 A0 A0 decay in\nthis MA range does not require a precise determination\nof the axion branching ratios, as we explain below.\nThe Higgs decays are quite peculiar in the scenario\ndiscussed here. Since the LEP [14] and Tevatron [15]\nlimits would generally apply, we only consider the range\nof Higgs masses above \u223c 100 GeV. Because of the relatively heavy parent mass, each axion will be produced\nwith a significant boost, and will decay into a pair of\n\nwhere \u03be is a Yukawa coupling, and the scalar potential is\n\u00012 \u03bbS\n\u00012\n\u03bbH\nH \u2020H +\nS \u2020 S + \u03bb0 H \u2020 HS \u2020 S\n2\n2\n\u0001\n2\n+ MH\nH \u2020 H + MS2 S \u2020 S + CS S + S \u2020 .\n(4)\n\nV (H, S) =\n\n2\nWe assume MH\n< 0, and \u03bbH \u03bbS > \u03bb20 . In the limit where\nthe coefficient CS of the tadpole term vanishes, the effective potential has a global U (1) symmetry spontaneously\nbroken by the vacuum expectation value hSi of S. The\nassociated axion, A0 , is part of the singlet\np S, and due to\nthe tadpole term has a mass given by |CS /hSi|. Note\nthat in the MCHM the tadpole term is generated by a\ntree level \u03c7 mass, and there is mixing between \u03c7 and t\nonce the electroweak symmetry is broken.

Here L is the total integrated luminosity\nrequired for a 95% confidence level (C.L.) exclusion, and\nP (A \u2192 \u03b3) is the (MA -dependent) probability that an axion is reconstructed as a photon, including the branching\nfractions of cascade decays of axions into multi-photon\nfinal states. We see that already run IIa with 2 fb\u22121 will\nbe probing a range of Higgs boson masses well beyond the\nreach via conventional SM searches [2]. Note the reversed\nordering of the lines of constant c at low and high Mh .\nBelow the W W -threshold, the Higgs boson width, \u0393h , is\ndominated by the decay (2) into axions, hence a larger c\nrequires a softer m\u03b3\u03b3 cut and leads to higher background.\nAbove the W W -threshold, where \u0393h is dominated by the\nSM decays, a larger c is beneficial due to the increased\nB(h \u2192 A0 A0 ) (see Fig. 1).\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n(a)\n6\u03b3\n\n3\u03c0 0\n\n0\nA0 h A0\n\n3\u03c0 0\n\n6\u03b3\n\n(b)\nFIG. 2. Higgs boson decay topology into a \"diphoton\" final\nstate with (a) prompt and (b) cascade photons.\n\nThe interesting twist is that the A0 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay mode\nwill have the same signature in the detector, because \u03c0 0 's\ndecay promptly into photons. This situation is illustrated\nin Fig. 2b. We can continue this line of argument for\neven higher MA . If MA >\n\u223c 1 GeV, the \u03c9\u03b3, \u03c1\u03b3, and \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0\naxion decay modes become relevant. Using the measured\nbranching fractions of \u03b7 \u2032 into these states, and the subsequent \u03b7, \u03c1, \u03c9 decays, we find that the \u03b7 \u2032 branching fraction for final states with only photons is roughly 17%.\nGiven the similarities between \u03b7 \u2032 and the axion, we expect the probability that A0 is reconstructed as a photon\nis of order 20% when MA \u223c 1 GeV.\nFor MA >\n\u223c 2 GeV, new isospin-conserving modes with\nlarge branching fractions open up: A0 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, \u03c9\u03c9, a0 \u03c0 0 ,\nKK\u03c0 0 , etc. (isospin-violating decays, such as \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0, are\nsuppressed.) Even then, some of these mesons have large\nbranching fractions into states which subsequently decay\ninto photons, e.g., a0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 [7], yielding the same diphoton signature for h0 . Only when MA is increased above\nseveral GeV do the decay products of h0 look more like\nQCD jets instead of photons.\nAn important issue is whether the A0 decays promptly.\nUsing Eq. (8), we can estimate its decay length\n\u0012\n\u00134\nMh hSi2\n1 GeV\nLA \u2248 4 mm\n.\n(9)\n3\nMA\n(100 GeV)\n\nFIG. 3. The Tevatron reach at 95% C.L. in the inclusive\ndiphoton channel (solid) and l2\u03b3 E\n/ T channel (dashed), as a\nfunction of Mh , for three different values of c.\n\nFor light axions, associated W h/Zh production can\ngive alternative, very clean signatures: l\u03b3\u03b3 E\n/ T and\nl+ l\u2212 \u03b3\u03b3. Considering only leptonic decays of the W/Z,\nwe expect W h to give a better reach, because of the\nlarger leptonic branching fraction. Requiring events with\nE\n/ T > 20 GeV, at least one lepton with pT (l) > 20 GeV,\nand at least two photons with pT (\u03b3) > 20 GeV and\n|m\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 Mh | < \u0393h , we find the following parametrization\nof the signal efficiency: \u03b5 = 0.32 \u2212 0.07(Mh /100 GeV).\nThe main background is W \u03b3\u03b3 and we estimated it using\nCOMPHEP [21] to be less than 1 event after cuts in 30\nfb\u22121 . The corresponding reach is shown in Fig. 3 (dashed\nlines). We see that although this channel gives a smaller\nabsolute reach than the inclusive 2\u03b3 channel, it will still\nenable the Tevatron to probe Higgs masses below W W\nthreshold, for a wide range of values of c.\nTevatron reach for heavy axions.- If MA is above a\nfew GeV, the decay products from A \u2192 gg look like\nQCD jets, and the background is large. To make mat-\n\nFor MA <\n\u223c 100 MeV the axion decays occur most of the\ntime outside the detector, so the Higgs boson decay is\ninvisible [16]. In the following we shall instead concentrate on the mass range MA >\n\u223c 200 MeV, where the axion\ndecays before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter.\nTevatron reach for light axions.- For MA less than\na few GeV, we have studied the Tevatron reach in the\ndiphoton channel, following the analysis of Ref. [17]. We\nused PYTHIA [18] for event generation and SHW [19]\nwith minor modifications [20] for detector simulation.\nThe Higgs boson is produced predominantly via gluon\nfusion, and the inclusive diphoton channel (with an optimized cut on the invariant diphoton mass, m\u03b3\u03b3 ) provides\n3\n\n\fters worse, at the parton level A0 \u2192 gg dominates over\nA0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 by a factor of (Nc2 \u2212 1)\u03b12s /(4Nc2 \u03b12 e4\u03c7 ) \u2248 265.\nTypically, for MA >\n\u223c 20 GeV, the resulting two gluon jets\nare separated well enough and can both be individually\nreconstructed. Unlike the SM, the final states from Higgs\nproduction contain no b-jets, but instead mostly gluon\njets and very rarely photons. Since at present it is practically impossible to distinguish between gluon and quark\njets, these searches appear quite challenging.\nGluon fusion (gg \u2192 h \u2192 A0 A0 ) can lead to 4j, 2j2\u03b3 or\n4\u03b3 events. The 4j channel suffers from insurmountable\nbackgrounds, while the 4\u03b3 channel has a tiny branching\nratio, and will escape detection even in run IIb with 30\nfb\u22121 . The 2j2\u03b3 channel is similar to the searches for a\n\"bosonic Higgs\" at the Tevatron [15,17,22]. Using the\nsame cuts as for the inclusive \u03b3\u03b3 + N jets channels of\nRef. [17], we found no reach in run IIb.\nSearches for associated Higgs boson production also\nappear very difficult. The 6-jet final states from allhadronic decays of the W (Z) and A0 have large QCD\nbackgrounds. Leptonic decays of the W and Z, combined\nwith h \u2192 4j give l4j E\n/ T and l+ l\u2212 4j, respectively. The\nbackgrounds are large and again no sensitivity in run II is\nexpected. Finally, requiring that one axion decays to \u03b3\u03b3,\nand leptonic decays of the W or Z, we get the relatively\nclean l2\u03b3 E\n/ T + X and l+ l\u2212 2\u03b3 + X final states. Because\nof the B(A0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) suppression, the signal rates are too\nsmall to be observed in run IIa, but run IIb might be\n<\nable to explore the mass range 100 <\n\u223c Mh \u223c 120 GeV.\nDiscovery prospects at the LHC and future lepton\ncolliders.- It is interesting to contemplate the capabilities of future colliders for our scenario. The LHC has\nenormous potential for such Higgs boson searches. Just\nlike at the Tevatron, one will have to concentrate on the\ncleanest channels. But the much larger signal rate will\nallow one to look for the photonic decays of heavy axions,\nwhich were severely limited by statistics at the Tevatron.\nPreliminary studies show that even the 2j2\u03b3 channel,\nswamped by the QCD background at the Tevatron, is\nsensitive to a large range of Higgs boson and axion masses\nat the LHC, due to the improved energy resolution of the\nLHC detectors and the enhanced signal cross section.\nA high energy lepton collider (such as the NLC) would\nbe ideally suited for unravelling a non-standard Higgs\nsector, like the one discussed in this Letter, particularly if\nMA is bigger than a few GeV and P (A \u2192 \u03b3) is very small.\nNotice that the jet-rich channels are the best to look for\nat a lepton collider, since they have the largest branching\nratios. In this sense, lepton colliders are complementary\nto hadron machines, where these channels suffer from\nlarge backgrounds. We also expect that LEP-II will be\nable to probe Higgs masses up to its kinematic reach,\nonce a dedicated search is done. We therefore urge the\nLEP collaborations to present Higgs mass limits with the\ndata selection optimized for the discussed signatures.\n\nIn conclusion, we have considered several novel Higgs\nboson discovery signatures, arising from the decay h0 \u2192\nA0 A0 , present in many extended Higgs sector models.\nQuite ironically, the best reach at the Tevatron is obtained for light axions, where the Higgs boson often decays to two jets, each of which \"fakes\" a photon.\nAcknowledgements.- We thank A.
