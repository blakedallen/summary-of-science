Introduction\nWe introduce the bipartite divisor graph B(X), for a non-empty subset X of\npositive integers, that contains information about two previously studied graphs,\nnamely the prime vertex graph and the common divisor graph for X. Our work\nwas inspired by a recent paper [3] by Mark L. Lewis which provides a fascinating\noverview of various graphs associated with groups. Surprisingly strong combinatorial information available for these graphs leads to structural information about\nthe groups and their representations. Lewis distilled and unified many results concerning these 'group graphs' (from the 78 references in his bibliography) by first\ndefining two graphs associated with an arbitrary non-empty subset X of positive\nintegers:\n(1) the prime vertex graph \u2206(X) has, as vertex set \u03c1(X), the set of primes\ndividing some element of X, and two such primes p, q are joined by an edge\nif and only if pq divides some x \u2208 X;\n(2) the common divisor graph \u0393(X) has vertex set X \u2217 := X \\{1}, and x, y \u2208 X \u2217\nform an edge if and only if gcd(x, y) > 1.\nAlthough, in the group setting, the subset X is usually the set of irreducible character degrees, or the set of conjugacy class sizes, or conjugacy class indices, of a\nfinite group, Lewis showed that, even for arbitrary integer sets X, the prime vertex\ngraph and the common divisor graph share very similar combinatorial properties,\nfor example, they have the same number of connected components, and similar diameters (where by the diameter Lewis means the maximum diameter of a connected\ncomponent).\nThe first author wishes to thank Yazd University Research Council for financial support during\nhis study leave, and The School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Western Australia,\nin particular Prof. Praeger, for their hospitality during his visit and for the facilities and help\nprovided. The second author was supported by a Federation Fellowship of the Australian Research\nCouncil.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. A. IRANMANESH AND C. E. PRAEGER\n\nThe bipartite divisor graph B(X), for an arbitrary non-empty subset X of positive integers, has as vertex set the disjoint union \u03c1(X) \u222a X \u2217 , and its edges are the\npairs {p, x} where p \u2208 \u03c1(X), x \u2208 X \u2217 and p divides x. Thus B(X) is bipartite,\nand {\u03c1(X)|X \u2217 } forms a bi-partition of the vertex set, that is unique if B(X) is\nconnected (and in the group cases, B(X) is often connected, see for example [3,\nTheorems 4.1, 5.2, 7.1, 8.1, 9.8], key references being [2, 4, 5, 6]). Moreover the\n'distance 2-graph', derived from B(X) by replacing the edges of B(X) by the set\nof pairs {u, v} that have distance 2 in B(X), contains \u2206(X) and \u0393(X) as the subgraphs induced on \u03c1(X) and X \u2217 , respectively. Thus it is not surprising that several\ncombinatorial properties of \u2206(X) and \u0393(X) can be derived from similar properties\nfor B(X). We study such properties as the diameter, girth, number of connected\ncomponents, and clique number for these three graphs, obtaining precise links relating these parameters for the various graphs, which we summarise below. Our\nfindings lead to interesting new questions in the 'group case', some of which are\nexplored in a forthcoming paper [1] of the authors with Bubboloni and Dolfi.\nIn particular, in [3, Lemma 3.3], Lewis proved that every graph G is isomorphic\nto \u2206(X) and to \u0393(Y ) for some sets of positive integers X and Y . Our main result\ncharacterises those bipartite graphs that arise as B(X) for some X. The proof in\nSection 2 gives an explicit construction of a subset X, for a given bipartite graph\nG.\nTheorem 1.1. A bipartite graph G is isomorphic to B(X), for some non-empty set\nof positive integers X, if and only if G is non-empty and has no isolated vertices.\nComment on Notation:\n(a) We call a graph bipartite if there is a bipartition {V1 |V2 } of its vertex set\nwith both V1 , V2 non-empty, such that each edge joins a vertex of V1 to a vertex of\nV2 . An empty graph is a graph with at least one vertex and no edges, and a vertex\nin a graph is isolated if it lies on no edge.\n(b) Usually the set X of positive integers is clear from the context. We therefore\nsuppress X in our notation and write B, \u2206, \u0393 for the graphs B(X), \u2206(X), \u0393(X)\nrespectively. Similarly, for example, we denote by n(B), n(\u2206), n(\u0393) the number\nof connected components of B, \u2206, \u0393 respectively, and, for vertices x, y in the same\nconnected component, we denote by dB (x, y), d\u2206 (x, y), d\u0393 (x, y) the distance (length\nof shortest path) between x and y for the graph B, \u2206, \u0393 respectively. Following\nLewis [3], we define the diameter as the maximum distance between vertices in the\nsame connected component, and we denote the diameters of these three graphs by\ndiam(B), diam(\u2206), diam(\u0393) respectively. Also, if there is a cycle in the graph B, \u2206\nor \u0393, we denote the girth (the length of the shortest cycle) by g(B), g(\u2206), or g(\u0393),\nrespectively.\nSummary of other results: (Definitions of the additional graph theoretic concepts are given in the relevant subsection.)\n(1) B, \u2206, \u0393 have equal numbers of connected components, and the maximum of\n\u230b. (Lemma 3.1)\ndiam(\u2206) and diam(\u0393) is \u230a diam(B)\n2\n(2) Any subset of {B, \u2206, \u0393} may be acyclic, and the others not. However, if\nB contains a cycle of length greater than 4, then all three graphs contain cycles.\n(Lemma 3.2)\n(3) Both \u2206 and \u0393 are acyclic if and only if each connected component of B is a\npath or isomorphic to C4 . (Theorem 4.2)\n\n\fBIPARTITE DIVISOR GRAPHS FOR INTEGER SUBSETS\n\n3\n\n(4) For m = 3, 4, at least one of \u2206, \u0393 contains a clique of size m (a subgraph\nKm ), if and only if B contains a subgraph in a specified list.\n(Theorems 4.1\nand 4.6)\n2. Representing bipartite graphs as B(X)\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.1, giving an explicit construction of a subset\nX, for a given bipartite graph G. We illustrate the construction with a simple\nexample in Figure 1.\np\n\nv1\n\n1\n\nu1\nv2\n\np\n\n2\n\np\n2\n2 2\n\npp\n\nu2\n\n3\n\nv3\nv4\n\n1 3\n\np\n3 3\n\npp\n\nu3\n\np\n\n2 4\n\n4\n\nFigure 1. Examples of G (left) and B(X) (right) for Lemma 1.1\nProof of Theorem 1.1 Suppose that G is a bipartite graph with vertex bipartition\n{V1 |V2 }. Let V1 = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vm } and V2 = {u1 , u2 , . . . , un } where m \u2265 1, n \u2265\n1. Suppose first that G has no isolated vertices. Let p1 , p2 , . . . , pm be pairwise\ndistinct primes, and let M = {p1 , p2 , . . . , pm }. Define a bijection f : V1 \u2212\u2192 M\nby f(vi ) = pi for each i. For 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n define Ij = {l|{vl , uj } \u2208 E(G)} and\nQ\nset xj = l\u2208Ij pjl . Note that Ij 6= \u2205, since there are no isolated vertices in G. Let\nX = {xj |1 \u2264 j \u2264 n}. The fact that \u03c1(X) = M follows because there are no isolated\nvertices in G. Now {pi , xj } \u2208 E(B), the edge set of B = B(X), if and only if pi\nQ\ndivides xj = l\u2208Ij pjl , that is, if and only if i \u2208 Ij , and this holds if and only if\n{vi , uj } \u2208 E(G). Thus extending f to a map V (G) \u2212\u2192 V (B) by f(ui ) = xi , for each\ni, defines an isomorphism from G to B(X).\nConversely, suppose that G \u223c\n= B(X), for some X. Then, since by the definition\nof a bipartite graph, G has at least one vertex, X 6= {1}. The fact that B(X) has\nno isolated vertices now follows from its definition.\n\u2737\nTheorem 1.1 provides an important tool for the proofs in the rest of the paper,\nby applying the following corollary.\nCorollary 2.1. For a non-empty set X of positive integers such that X 6= {1},\nthere exists a second non-empty set Y of positive integers, and a graph isomorphism\n\u03c6 : B(X) \u2192 B(Y ) that induces isomorphisms \u2206(X) \u223c\n= \u0393(Y ) and \u0393(X) \u223c\n= \u2206(Y ).\nProof. Let G = B(X) with vertex bipartition {\u03c1(X) | X \u2217}. By definition, G is nonempty and has no isolated vertices. We apply the proof of Theorem 1.1 to the\nreverse bipartition {X \u2217 |\u03c1(X)}. This produces a non-empty subset Y of positive\nintegers and a graph isomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 B(Y ), that induces a graph isomorphism\nfrom \u2206(Y ) to the distance 2 graph induced on the first part X \u2217 of the bipartition\n(which by definition of G is \u0393(X)), and a graph isomorphism from \u0393(Y ) to the\n\n\f4\n\nM.

Relating the parameters of B, \u2206, \u0393\nIn this section we study certain parameters for the three graphs, namely distance,\ndiameter, girth, and number of components. Throughout the section let X denote a\nnon-empty subset of positive integers with X 6= {1}, so that X \u2217 6= \u2205. As mentioned\nabove we simplify our notation and write B := B(X), \u2206 := \u2206(X), \u0393 := \u0393(X). We\ndenote the vertex sets of these graphs by V (B), V (\u2206), V (\u0393), and the edge sets by\nE(B), E(\u2206), E(\u0393), respectively.\n3.1. Distance, diameter, and numbers of components. A key technical result\nin Lewis's paper, namely [3, Lemma 3.1 and Corollary 3.2], can be interpreted as a\n1-1 correspondence between the (connected) components of \u2206 and \u0393 leading to the\nconsequence that the diameters of \u2206 and \u0393 differ by at most 1. We extend these\nresults to give analogous information about the graph B from which the facts about\n\u2206 and \u0393 may be deduced. We note that, although in many of the 'group cases'\nthe graphs \u2206 and \u0393 have at most 2 components and diameter at most 3 (see for\nexample [3, Corollary 4.2, Theorems 7.1, 8.1, 8.3]), for general X these parameters\nmay be arbitrarily large.\nFor u \u2208 V (B), let [u]B denote the connected component of B containing u, and\nsimilarly define [u]\u2206 , [u]\u0393 if u \u2208 V (\u2206) or u \u2208 V (\u0393) respectively.\nLemma 3.1. Let p, q \u2208 \u03c1(X) and x, y \u2208 X \u2217 such that [p]B = [q]B and [x]B = [y]B .\nThen,\n(a) dB (p, q) = 2d\u2206 (p, q), dB (x, y) = 2d\u0393 (x, y);\n(b) if p divides x and q divides y, then [p]B = [x]B = [p]\u2206 \u222a [x]\u0393 and dB (p, q) \u2212\ndB (x, y) \u2208 {\u22122, 0, 2};\n(c) n(B) = n(\u2206) = n(\u0393);\n(d) either\n(i) diam(B) = 2max{diam(\u2206), diam(\u0393)}, and |diam(\u2206) \u2212 diam(\u0393)| \u2264 1,\nor\n(ii) diam(\u2206) = diam(\u0393) = 21 (diam(B) \u2212 1).\nTable 1 gives simple examples to show that all possibilities for the diameters of\nB, \u2206, \u0393 given by Lemma 3.1(d) arise.\nProof. (a) Suppose that d\u2206 (p, q) = k. Then there exists a shortest path P\u2206 =\n(p0 , p1 , . . . , pk ) in \u2206 with p = p0 and q = pk . Now {pi , pi+1 } is an edge of \u2206 if and\nonly if dB (pi , pi+1 ) = 2, and hence there exists a path PB = (p0 , x1 , p1 , . . . , xk\u22121 , pk )\nin B of length 2k. Thus dB (p, q) \u2264 2k, and as p, q are in the same part of the\nbipartition of B, we have dB (p, q) = 2l \u2264 2k. If PB\u2032 = (p\u20320 , x\u20321 , p\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032l , p\u2032l ) is a\n\u2032\nshortest path in B with p = p\u20320 and q = p\u2032l , then P\u2206\n= (p\u20320 , p\u20321 , . . . , p\u2032l ) is a path\n\n\fBIPARTITE DIVISOR GRAPHS FOR INTEGER SUBSETS\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

An\nanalogous proof shows that dB (x, y) = 2d\u0393 (x, y).\n(b) Suppose now that p divides x and q divides y. If the path PB\u2032 above can be\nchosen with x\u20321 = x and x\u2032l = y then dB (p, q)\u2212dB (x, y) \u2265 2, and a similar argument\nto the above shows that equality holds; on the other hand if one of these equalities,\nbut not the other can be achieved then we find dB (p, q) = dB (x, y), while if neither\ncan hold on a shortest path PB\u2032 , then dB (x, y) \u2212 dB (p, q) = 2. This proves that\ndB (p, q) \u2212 dB (x, y) \u2208 {\u22122, 0, 2}, and (see Table 1) all cases are possible. Moreover\nin this case, by assumption, the component [p]B contains all of p, q, x, y, and the\nfact that [p]B = [p]\u2206 \u222a [x]\u0393 follows from the proof of part (a).\n(c) The assertion about numbers of connected components follows from the assertion in part (b) about components.\n(d) Let m = max{diam(\u2206), diam(\u0393)}. Then it follows from part (a) that\ndiam(B) \u2265 2m. Let M = diam(B), so that M \u2265 2m, and choose a, b \u2208 V (B)\nsuch that dB (a, b) = M . If a and b are both in \u03c1(X) (or both in X \u2217 ), then\nM = dB (a, b) = 2d\u2206 (a, b) \u2264 2diam(\u2206) \u2264 2m (respectively, M \u2264 2diam(\u0393) \u2264 2m)\nand in either case we conclude that M = 2m. On the other hand (without loss of\ngenerality) suppose that a \u2208 \u03c1(X) and b \u2208 X \u2217 , so M is odd and hence M \u2265 2m + 1.\nLet p \u2208 \u03c1(X) be the vertex adjacent to b on a path PB of length M from a to b.\nThen the sub-path of PB , from p to a, must be a shortest path between these two\nvertices, by definition of M , and hence M \u2212 1 = dB (a, p) = 2d\u2206 (a, p), by part (a),\nand this is at most 2diam(\u2206). A similar argument using the vertex adjacent to a\non PB yields M \u2264 2diam(\u0393) + 1. It follows that diam(\u2206) = diam(\u0393) = M\u22121\n2 .\nTo prove the last assertion of (i) we may assume that diam(B) = 2m. Let\n\uf6be = diam(\u2206) and let p0 , p\uf6be \u2208 \u03c1(X) be such that d\u2206 (p0 , p\uf6be ) = \uf6be. Then by part (a),\nthere exists a path PB\u2032 of length 2\uf6be in B from p0 to p\uf6be . Let x0 , x1 be vertices on PB\u2032\nadjacent to p0 and p\uf6be respectively. Then the sub-path of PB\u2032 from x0 to x1 of length\n2\uf6be \u2212 2 is a shortest path in B between these two vertices. Thus dB (x0 , x1 ) = 2\uf6be \u2212 2.\nBy part (a), d\u0393 (x0 , x1 ) = \uf6be \u2212 1 and therefore diam(\u0393) \u2265 diam(\u2206) \u2212 1. A similar\nargument shows that diam(\u2206) \u2265 diam(\u0393) \u2212 1. Hence |diam(\u2206) \u2212 diam(\u0393)| \u2264 1.\u2737\u2737\n\n3.2. Cycles and girth. A graph G is said to be acyclic if it contains no cycles,\nthat is, it contains no closed paths of length at least 3. On the other hand, recall\nthat, if G contains a cycle then the minimum length of its cycles is called its girth\nand denoted g(G). For any subset K \u2286 {B, \u2206, \u0393} there exists X such that the\ngraphs in K are acyclic and each graph not in K contains a cycle. Examples of\nsubsets X are provided in Table 2 for the seven non-empty subsets K of {B, \u2206, \u0393},\n\n\f6\n\nM. A. IRANMANESH AND C. E. PRAEGER\n\nTable 2.

In this last example, B has girth 4, while the other two graphs have girth\n3. However, once the graph B contains a cycle of length greater than 4, we prove\nthat all three of the graphs contain cycles. Even in this case it is possible for one\nor both of \u2206 or \u0393 to have girth 3 regardless of the size of g(B), simply by adding\nto X an analogue of the subset X2 or X3 of Table 2 (involving suitable primes).\nHowever if the girths of \u2206 or \u0393 are greater than 3, we show that there is a tight\nlink between these girths and the minimum length of cycles in B with more than 4\nvertices.\nIn Table 2 we denote a complete graph and a cycle on m vertices by Km and\nCm , respectively, and if B = B(X) is a complete bipartite graph with |\u03c1(X)| = m\n\u2192\nand |X \u2217 | = n, then we denote B by Km,n\n.\nLemma 3.2. Suppose that B contains a cycle of length greater than 4. Then each\nof \u2206 and \u0393 also contains a cycle. Moreover, for \u03a6 \u2208 {\u2206, \u0393}, either g(\u03a6) = 3 or\ng(\u03a6) = 21 g\u2032 (B), where g\u2032 (B) is the minimum length of cycles of B with more than\nfour vertices.\nProof. Since B is bipartite, g\u2032 (B) = 2k for some k \u2265 3. Let PB = (p1 , x1 , . . . , pk , xk )\nbe a closed path of length 2k in B with the pi \u2208 \u03c1(X) and the xi \u2208 X \u2217 . By the definition of B, pi divides xi and xi\u22121 , for i = 1, . . . , k, reading the subscripts modulo\nk. Hence there exist closed paths of length k in both \u2206 and \u0393. This implies that\nboth \u2206 and \u0393 contain cycles and g(\u2206) \u2264 k, g(\u0393) \u2264 k.\nIf g(\u2206) = l < k, then there exists a closed path P\u2206 = (p\u20321 , p\u20322 , . . . , p\u2032l ) in \u2206.\nBy the definition of \u2206, for each i, there exists x\u2032i \u2208 X \u2217 that is divisible by both\np\u2032i and p\u2032i+1 , reading subscripts modulo l. If the x\u2032i are pairwise distinct, then\nPB\u2032 = (p\u20321 , x\u20321 , . . . , p\u2032l , x\u2032l ) is a closed path in B of length 2l, and 6 \u2264 2l < 2k = g\u2032 (B),\nwhich is a contradiction. Hence the x\u2032i are not all distinct. Let i, j be such that\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l and x\u2032i = x\u2032j . Then in \u2206 the induced subgraph on the subset\n{p\u2032i , p\u2032i+1 , p\u2032j , p\u2032j+1 } is a complete graph (of order 3 or 4) and hence l = g(\u2206) = 3.\nThus either g(\u2206) = 3 or g(\u2206) = k. A similar proof shows that either g(\u0393) = 3 or\ng(\u0393) = k.\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\nWe consider further, in Section 4.2, the case where both \u0393 and \u2206 are acyclic,\ncharacterising the graphs B in this case.\n\n\fBIPARTITE DIVISOR GRAPHS FOR INTEGER SUBSETS\n\n7\n\n4. Subgraphs of B, \u2206, \u0393\nIn this section we prove several results that link existence of certain subgraphs\nin B with the existence of related subgraphs in \u2206 and \u0393. Let G = (V, E) be a\ngraph with vertex set V and edge set E. By a subgraph of G, we mean a graph\n{2}\n{2}\nG0 = (V0 , E0 ) where V0 \u2286 V and E0 \u2286 E \u2229 V0 . If E0 = E \u2229 V0 , then G0 is\ncalled an induced subgraph.\n4.1. Triangles in \u2206 and \u0393. First we look at the existence of triangles (that is,\n3-cycles, closed paths of length 3) in the graphs \u2206 and \u0393.\nTheorem 4.1. At least one of \u2206, \u0393 contains a triangle if and only if B contains\nC6 or K1,3 as an induced subgraph.\nProof. Suppose first that g(\u0393) = 3 and let P\u0393 = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) be a cycle in \u0393. If\nthere exists a prime p which divides xi , for all i = 1, 2, 3, then the set {p, x1 , x2 , x3 }\ninduces a subgraph K1,3 of B. So we may assume that no such prime exists. Then,\nsince P\u0393 is a cycle in \u0393, there are distinct primes p1 , p2 , p3 such that, for each i, pi\ndivides xi\u22121 and xi , writing subscripts modulo 3, and the set {p1 , x1 , p2 , x2 , p3 , x3 }\ninduces a subgraph C6 of B. Thus g(\u0393) = 3 implies that B contains an induced\nsubgraph isomorphic to either C6 or K1,3 . By Corollary 2.1, it follows that g(\u2206) = 3\nimplies that B contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to either C6 or K1,3 .\nConversely, if {p1 , x1 , p2 , x2 , p3 , x3 } induces a subgraph C6 in B, where the pi \u2208\n\u03c1(X) and the xi \u2208 X \u2217 , then (p1 , p2 , p3 ) and (x1 , x2 , x3 ) are cycles in \u2206 and \u0393\nrespectively, so g(\u2206) = g(\u0393) = 3. Similarly if B contains an induced subgraph\nK1,3 , then at least one of \u2206, \u0393 contains a triangle. This completes the proof. \u2737 \u2737\n\n4.2. Acyclic graphs. Next we characterise the cases where both \u2206 and \u0393 are\nacyclic.\nTheorem 4.2. Both the graphs \u0393 and \u2206 are acyclic if and only if each connected\ncomponent of B is a path or a cycle of length 4.\nProof. Suppose first that \u2206, \u0393 are both acyclic. If some vertex of B lies on at least\nthree edges, then one of \u2206, \u0393 contains a 3-cycle, which is a contradiction. Thus\neach vertex of B lies on at most two edges in B. Since B is bipartite, this means\nthat each connected component of B is a path, or a cycle C2k of even length 2k \u2265 4.\nMoreover, in the case of a component C2k , it follows from Lemma 3.2 that k = 2.\nConversely, suppose that each component of B is a path or isomorphic to C4 . For\na component C4 of B, the corresponding component of \u2206, \u0393 is isomorphic to K2 .\nConsider a component B \u2032 of B which is a path. Suppose that P\u2206 = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pl )\nis a cycle in the corresponding component of \u2206 of length l \u2265 3. By the definition\nof \u2206, for each i, there exists xi \u2208 X \u2217 that is divisible by both pi and pi+1 , reading\nsubscripts modulo l. If the xi are pairwise distinct, then PB \u2032 = (p1 , x1 , . . . , pl , xl ) is\na cycle in B \u2032 , which is a contradiction. Hence there exist i, j such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l\nand xi = xj . This however implies that xi is joined to at least three vertices in B \u2032 ,\ncontradicting the fact that B \u2032 is a path. Hence the component of \u2206 corresponding\nto B \u2032 is acyclic. A similar proof shows that the component of \u0393 corresponding to\nB \u2032 is also acyclic.\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\n\f8\n\nM. A. IRANMANESH AND C. E. PRAEGER\n\nWe have the following immediate corollary for the case where both \u2206 and \u0393 are\ntrees, where by a tree we mean a connected acyclic graph.\nCorollary 4.3. Both graphs \u0393 and \u2206 are trees if and only if either B is a path or\nB\u223c\n= C4 .\n4.3. Incidence graphs of complete graphs. As preparation for our final theorem, we study the existence of incidence graphs of complete graphs as subgraphs\nof B.\nDefinition 4.4. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E.\n \u0307\nThen the incidence graph Inc(G) of G, is the bipartite graph with vertex set V \u222aE\nsuch that {v, e} forms an edge if and only if v \u2208 V , e \u2208 E and v is incident with e\nin G.\nLemma 4.5. The graph B contains a subgraph isomorphic to Inc(Kl ) if and only\nif one of the following conditions (i) or (ii) holds.\n\u0001(i) \u0393 contains a complete subgraph Kl with vertices {x1 , x2 , . . . , xl }, and there are\nl\n2 pairwise distinct primes pij , for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l, such that pij divides gcd(xi , xj ).\n(ii) \u0001\u2206 contains a complete subgraph Kl with vertices {p1 , p2 , . . . , pl } and there\nare 2l pairwise distinct numbers xij \u2208 X \u2217 , for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l, such that pi pj\ndivides xij .\nProof. Suppose that condition (i) holds and let G be the subgraph of B with V (G) =\n \u0307 ij , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l} and edges {pij , xi } and {pij , xj } for each i, j.\n{x1 , x2 , . . . , xl }\u222a{p\n(Note that G may not be an induced subgraph.) Let Kl be the complete graph\non V = {1, 2, . . . , l} with edge set E = {eij = {i, j}|1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l}. Define\n\u03a8 : Inc(Kl ) \u2212\u2192 G by \u03a8 : i \u2212\u2192 xi , eij \u2212\u2192 pij . It is straightforward to check that\n\u03a8 is a graph isomorphism. A similar isomorphism can be constructed if condition\n(ii) holds.\nConversely suppose that B contains a subgraph M isomorphic to Inc(Kl ). Then\nM is connected and bipartite, and hence one of its bipartite halves, say V , has\nsize l, and each pair of its elements are at distance two in B. Moreover V must\nbe contained in X \u2217 or \u03c1(X), and hence induce a complete subgraph Kl of \u0393 or \u2206,\nrespectively. It is straightforward to check the remaining assertions of the condition\n(i) or (ii) respectively.\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\n4.4. Complete subgraphs K4 of \u2206 and \u0393. In this final subsection we show in\nTheorem 4.6 that existence of a complete subgraph K4 of \u2206 or \u0393 is equivalent to\nexistence of at least one of a small number of possible subgraphs of B.\nTo demonstrate that each of the cases of Theorem 4.6 does indeed occur, we give\nin Tables 3 and 4 examples of small subsets X for the various cases. In Table 3,\np, p1 , . . . , p6 denote primes such that pi 6= pj for i 6= j. Also L(K4 ) denotes the\nline graph of K4 , with vertex set E(K4 ) and two vertices adjacent if and only if the\n\u2192\ncorresponding edges of K4 have a vertex in common. We denote by Ka,b\na complete\nbipartite subgraph of B(X) with a vertices in \u03c1(X) and b vertices in X \u2217 .

(i) If \u2206 has a subgraph K4 , then B contains a subgraph isomorphic\n\u2192\nto one of K4,1\n, Inc(K4 ), K or G.\n(ii) If \u0393 has a subgraph K4 , then B contains a subgraph isomorphic to one of\n\u2192\nK1,4\n, Inc(K4 ), K or G.\n\u2192\n\u2192\n(iii) If B contains a subgraph isomorphic to one of K1,4\n, K4,1\n, Inc(K4 ), K or\nG, then at least one of \u2206 or \u0393 has a subgraph K4 .\nProof. (i) Suppose that \u03c0 = {p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 } \u2286 \u03c1(X) induces a subgraph K4 of \u2206. If\nQ4\nthere exists x \u2208 X divisible by i=1 pi , then the subgraph of B induced on \u03c0 \u222a {x}\n\u2192\nis K4,1\n. Thus we may assume that no such x exists. By the definition of \u2206, for\neach i, j satisfying 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4, there exists xij \u2208 X such that pi pj divides xij .\nSuppose next that some element x \u2208 X is divisible by three of the pi , without\nloss of generality, that x is divisible by p1 p2 p3 . If x14 , x24 , x34 are all distinct, then\nthe subgraph of B induced on \u03c0 \u222a{x, x14 , x24 , x34 } contains the graph G of Figure 2.\nIf this is not the case then, without loss of generality, x14 = x24 , and this number\nis therefore divisible by p1 p2 p4 . By our assumption, p3 does not divide x14 , and\n\n\f10\n\nM. A. IRANMANESH AND C. E. PRAEGER\n\nhence x34 6= x14 , and the subgraph of B induced on \u03c0 \u222a {x, x14 , x34 } contains the\ngraph K of Figure 2.\nThus we may assume that no element of X is divisible by more than two primes\nin \u03c0, and hence that the xij are pairwise distinct. It now follows from Lemma 4.5\nthat B contains a subgraph isomorphic to Inc(K4 ).\n(ii) Suppose that X0 {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 } \u2286 X \u2217 induces a subgraph K4 of \u0393. By\nCorollary 2.1, there is a set Y and a graph isomorphism \u03c6 : B(X) \u2192 B(Y ) that\ninduces an isomorphism \u0393(X) \u223c\n= \u2206(Y ). Thus \u2206(Y ) has an induced subgraph K4 ,\nand hence part (ii) follows from part (i).\n\u2192\n(iii) Finally suppose that B contains a subgraph H isomorphic to one of K1,4\n,\n\u2192\nK4,1 , Inc(K4 ), K or G. Then H is connected and bipartite, and the distance 2\ngraph induced on one of its bipartite halves is isomorphic to K4 . Thus \u2206 or \u0393 has\na subgraph isomorphic to K4 .\n\u2737\n\u2737\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Bubboloni, S. Dolfi, M. A. Iranmanesh, C. E.
