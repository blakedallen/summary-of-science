Graphically\nwe have shown that the GSL may be satisfied for open, closed and flat universe on the different\nhorizons with different conditions.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, a power-counting renormalizable theory\nof gravity was proposed by Ho\u0159ava [1-4]. This is a\nnon-relativistic theory of gravity and is expected to\nrecover Einstein's general relativity at large scales. This\ntheory does not have the full diffeomorphism invariance.\nAlthough presenting an infrared (IR) fixed point, namely\nGeneral Relativity, in the UV the theory exhibits an\nLifshitz type anisotropic scaling between time and\nscale, so it is commonly known as Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz (HL)\ngravity. The HL gravity theory has attracted much\nattention as a candidate quantum field theory of gravity\nwith z = 3 in the UV, where z measures the degree of\nanisotropy between space and time. In 3+1 dimensions,\nthe Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz theory has a z = 3 fixed point\nin the UV and flows to a z = 1 fixed point in the\nIR, which is just the classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity\ntheory. In this theory the effective coupling constant is\ndimensionless. This theory of gravity has four possible\nversions so far - with/without the detailed balance\ncondition and with/without projectability condition.\nAmong these version without detailed balance and with\nthe projectability condition is the most viable one.\nHo\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity has been studied and extended\nin detail [5] and it has been applied as the cosmological\nframework of the universe [6, 7]. It was extensively\napplied to a resolution of the cosmological problem\nincluding inflation and non-Gaussianity in [8, 9], and\nnew solutions were constructed in [10, 11]. Amongst\nthe very interesting physical implications are the novel\nsolution subclass [10,12], the gravitational wave production [13], dark energy phenomenology [14], astrophysical\nphenomenology [15], observational constraints [16] etc.\nStatic spherically symmetric black hole solutions in\nHo\u0159ava- Lifshitz gravity has been studied in [10]. However, despite this extended research, there are still many\nambiguities if Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity is reliable and\ncapable of a successful description of the gravitational\nbackground of our world, as well as of the cosmological\n\n\u2217 samarpita sarbajna@yahoo.co.in\n\u2212\n\u2020\n\nbehavior of the universe [17]. There are several work\non the thermodynamical properties of black hole in\nHo\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity theory [18].\nHere we consider the universe is treated as a thermodynamical system and we discuss the GSL of\nthermodynamics in Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity theory. Till\nnow there are some works [19] have been done on\nthermodynamics in FRW model with HL gravity. Here\nwe try to examine the validity of GSL on the horizons\nin Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity theory. For this purpose, we\ninvestigate two approaches. The first approach is to\nconsider the FRW universe is filled with only matter\nfield and using first law, we examine the validity of\nGSL on the horizons and give some conditions in HL\ngravity. Second approach is to absorb all the extra\nterms of HL gravity in an dark energy component and\nwe consider the universe is filled with dark matter and\nthis type of dark energy. But the first approach is more\ninteresting, because we have directly get the additional\ninformation of HL gravity model. Recently Jamil et al\n[20] have discussed the validity of GSL considering these\ntwo types of approaches. We have extend their work in\ndifferent horizons like, Hubble, apparent, particle and\nevent horizons in general manner. Finally, we give some\nsolutions for barotropic fluid and justify the validity of\nGSL in different horizons.\n\nII.\n\nHO\u0158AVA-LIFSHITZ GRAVITY THEORY\n\nWe briefly review here the scenario where the cosmological evolution is governed by Ho\u0159ava-Lifsfitz gravity [6,\n7]. The dynamical variables are the lapse rate and shift\nfunctions, N and Ni respectively, and the spatial metric gij . In the (3+1) dimensional Arnowitt-Deser-Misner\nformalism the full metric [21] is written as\nds2 = \u2212N 2 dt2 + gij (dxi + N i dt)(dxj + N j dt)\n\n(1)\n\nThe scaling transformation of the coordinates reads:\nt \u2192 l3 t and xi \u2192 lxi . The gravitational action is decomposed\ninto a kinetic and a potential part as S =\nR\n3 \u221a\n\n\f2\ndition the full action condition of Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity\nis given by\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\ndtd3 x gN\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03ba2\n2\nij\n2\n(K\nK\n\u2212\n\u03bbK\n)\n+\nCij C ij\nij\n\u03ba2\n2\u03c9 4\n\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\u01ebijk\n\u03ba 2 \u03bc2\nRij Rij\n\u221a Ril \u2207j Rkl +\n2\n2\u03c9 g\n8\n\n\u03ba 2 \u03bc2\n+\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 4\u03bb 2\nR + \u039bR \u2212 3\u039b2\n4\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n1\n(\u0121ij \u2212 \u2207i Nj \u2212 \u2207j Ni )\nKij =\n2N\n\n\u2212\n\nGc =\n\nis the extrinsic curvature and\n\nis known as Cotton tensor and the covariant derivatives are defined with respect to the spatial metric gij .\n\u01ebijk is the totally antisymmetric unit tensor, \u03bb is a\ndimensionless coupling constant and the variable \u03ba ,\n\u03c9 and \u03bc are constants with mass dimensions \u22121, 0, 1\nrespectively. Also \u039b is a positive constant, which as\nusual is related to the cosmological constant in the IR\nlimit. In order to incorporate the (dark plus baryonic)\nmatter component one adds a cosmological stress-energy\ntensor to the gravitational field equations, by demanding\nto recover the usual general relativity formulation in the\nlow energy limit. Let us suppose the energy density and\npressure are denoted by \u03c1 and p respectively.\n\n\u03ba2\n16\u03c0(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n\u03ba 4 \u03bc2 \u039b\n=1\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)2\n\nikl\n\n(4)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere H \u2261 \u0227a is the Hubble parameter. The term proportional to a\u22124 is the usual \"dark radiation\", present\nin Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz cosmology while the constant term is\njust the explicit cosmological constant. For k = 0, there\nis no contribution from the higher order derivative terms\nin the action. However for k 6= 0, there higher derivative\nterms are significant for small volume i.e., for small a and\nbecome insignificant for large a, where it agrees with general relativity. As a last step, requiring these expressions\nto coincide the standard Friedmann equations, in units\nwhere c = 1 we set [6, 7],\n\n(3)\n\n\u01eb\n1\nC ij = \u221a \u2207k (Rij \u2212 R\u03b4lj )\ng\n4\n\n\u0015\n3\u03ba2 \u03bc2 \u039b2\n\u03ba4 \u03bc2 k\u039b\n\u2212\n8(3\u03bb \u2212 1)\n16(3\u03bb \u2212 1)2 a2\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Gc is the \"cosmological\" Newton's constant. We\nmention that in theories with Lorentz invariance breaking (such is Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz one) the \"gravitational\" Newton's constant G, that is the one that is present in the\ngravitational action, does not coincide with Gc , that is\nthe one that is present in Friedmann equations, unless\nLorentz invariance is restored [22], where\n\nG=\n\n\u03ba2\n32\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nas it can be straightforwardly read from the action (2).\nIn the IR (\u03bb = 1) where Lorentz invariance is restored,\nGc = G. Using the above identifications, we can re-write\nthe Friedmann equations (7) and (8) as,\n\nNow, in order to focus on cosmological frameworks, we\nimpose the so called projectability condition [17] and use\na Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric,\n\nH2 +\n\nk\n8\u03c0Gc\n\u039b\nk2\n=\n+\n\u03c1\n+\na2\n3\n2\u039ba4\n2\n\n(12)\n\nand\n2\n\ni\n\nN = 1, gij = a (t)\u03b3ij , N = 0\n\n(5)\n\nwith\n\u03b3ij dxi dxj =\n\n2\n\ndr\n+ r2 d\u03a922 ,\n1 \u2212 kr2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k = 0, \u22121, +1 corresponding to flat, open and\nclosed respectively.

For other\ntypes of solutions, we may obtain similar types of results.\nSo, in HL gravity, the GSL may be satisfied on different\nhorizons.\n\nV.

If the\nuniverse contains barotropic fluid the corresponding\nsolutions have been obtained. Consider the universe as\na thermodynamical system bounded by horizons. The\nvalidity of GSL have been examined by two approaches:\n(i) robust approach and (ii) effective approach. In robust\napproach, we have considered the universe contains only\nmatter fluid and the effect of the gravitational sector of\nHL gravity was incorporated through the modified black\nhole entropy on the horizon. The general prescription\nfor validity of GSL have been discussed. But we cannot\ndraw any definite conclusion for validity of GSL in\nopen, closed and flat models. So graphical experiments\nhave been investigated for final conclusion. The total\nvariations of entropies on Hubble, apparent, particle\nand event horizons have been presented in figures 1\n- 4. These figures show that on Hubble horizon, the\nGSL is satisfied always for closed universe and for open\nuniverse, GSL breaks down. Also for flat universe, GSL\nmay be satisfied on Hubble horizon but at late stage\n(z < \u22120.8) GSL breaks down. On apparent horizon,\nthe GSL is always satisfied for closed and flat universe.\nAlso for open universe, GSL breaks down. On particle\nhorizon, the GSL is satisfied always for closed and flat\nuniverse and for open universe, GSL breaks down. On\nevent horizon, the GSL is satisfied always for closed and\nopen universe and for flat universe, GSL breaks down.\nEffective approach is that all extra information of\nHL gravity into an effective dark energy fluid and so\nwe consider the universe contains matter fluid plus this\neffective fluid. This approach is essentially same as the\nEinstein's gravity theory. In this situation, we have\nobtained the general conditions for validity of GSL in\nopen, closed and flat model of the universe. It has been\nseen that on the apparent horizon, the GSL is always\nvalid. But for other horizons, it may or may not be valid.\nThe total variations of entropies on Hubble, particle\nand event horizons have been presented in figures 5 7. From figures, we see that on Hubble horizon, the\nGSL is satisfied always for open and closed universe.\nAlso for flat universe, GSL may be satisfied on Hubble\nhorizon but at late stage (z < \u22120.8) GSL breaks down.\nOn particle horizon, the GSL is satisfied always for\nopen, closed and flat universe. On event horizon, the\nGSL cannot be satisfied for open, closed and flat universe.\nAcknowledgement:\nThe authors are thankful to IUCAA, Pune, India for\nwarm hospitality where part of the work was carried out.\n\n[1] P.
