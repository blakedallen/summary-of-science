The\ngreat majority of such investigations take place in the framework of the Extended Standard Model (ESM), conceived\nby Colladay and Kosteletck\u00fd [2] as a extension of the minimal Standard Model of the fundamental interactions. The\nESM admits Lorentz and CPT violation in all sectors of interactions by incorporating tensor terms (generated possibly\nas vacuum expectation values of a more fundamental theory) that account for such a breaking. Actually, the ESM\nmodel sets out as an effective model that keeps unaffected the SU (3)\u00d7 SU (2)\u00d7 U (1) gauge structure of the underlying\nfundamental theory while it breaks Lorentz symmetry at the particle frame. There is a large amount of work in the\nliterature [3, 4] searching for experimental and observational evidence of Lorentz breaking, in an attempt to put lower\nbound on the parameters.\nTopological defects are actually one of the most active research branches of theoretical physics, with profound\nconnections with condensed matter physics, gravitation and field theory [5]. In particular, kink solutions are the\nsimplest topological defects which appear after symmetry breaking of models with one or more scalar fields. Explicit\nsolutions have been worked in several models involving one or more scalar fields [6], including gravity [7], nested\ndefects [8], junctions [9] or connections with other areas of physics [10].\nThe influence of Lorentz violation on kink solutions was investigated in ref. [11], where the first-order framework\nwas applied for some class of models finding explicit solutions in some interesting cases. Here we pursue this problem\nstudying another class of models with some new results including explicit solutions, phase space analysis, stability\nanalysis and perturbative solutions. This paper is outlined as follows. In Sec. II, we present our model with Lorentz\nviolation and we apply the Bogomol'nyi method to find first-order equations that minimize the energy and solve the\nequations of motion. The behavior of numerical solutions are studied in the phase space for several values of the\nLorentz breaking parameter. In Sec. III we prove that our solutions are stable and we find that the model support\ntraveling waves. Further, in Sec. IV we find explicit perturbative solutions for the fields. Our final conclusions are\npresented in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS\n\nWe consider a class of models with two real scalar fields\nL=\n\n1 \u03bc\n1\n\u2202 \u03c6\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c7\u2202\u03bc \u03c7 + k \u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b2 \u03c7 \u2212 V (\u03c6, \u03c7),\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere the coupling tensor k \u03bc\u03bd characterizes Lorentz violation. The tensor coefficient is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b2 \u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b2\n,\nk =\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nand is an element that couples the scalar fields, introducing Lorentz violation and inducing an asymmetry in the\npropagation of the traveling waves present in these models. The Euler-Lagrange equations can be written as\n\u03c6\u0308 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 + \u03b2(\u03c7\u0308 + \u03c7\u2032\u2032 ) + 2\u03b1\u03c7\u0307\u2032 + V\u03c6 = 0,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7\u0308 \u2212 \u03c7 + \u03b2(\u03c6\u0308 + \u03c6 ) + 2\u03b1\u03c6\u0307 + V\u03c7 = 0,\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n\nwhere V\u03c6 = \u2202V /\u2202\u03c6, V\u03c7 = \u2202V /\u2202\u03c7, and prime and dot stand for space and time derivative, respectively. In the case of\nstatic solutions, we get\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + \u03b2\u03c7\u2032\u2032 + V\u03c6 = 0,\n\u2212\u03c7\u2032\u2032 + \u03b2\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + V\u03c7 = 0.\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor,\nT \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1 \u03bc \u03bd\n[\u2202 \u03c6\u2202 \u03c6 + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c7\u2202 \u03bd \u03c7 \u2212 k \u03bc\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 \u03c7\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6 + k \u03b1\u03bc \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6\u2202 \u03bd \u03c7 \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd L] ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nprovides the energy density of the static solutions:\nT 00 =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 \u20322\n\u03c6 + \u03c7\u20322 \u2212 2\u03b2\u03c6\u2032 \u03c7\u2032 + 2V (\u03c6, \u03c7) .\n2\n\nA useful form for representing the potential V (\u03c6, \u03c7) can be attained from Eqs. (3a) and (3b), as we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\n1 2 1 2\n\u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 + \u03b2\u03c6\u2032 \u03c7\u2032 + V = 0.\ndx\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThen a potential satisfying\nV =\n\n1 \u20322 1 \u20322\n\u03c6 + \u03c7 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c6\u2032 \u03c7\u2032\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwould lead to the second-order equations of motion for the fields \u03c6 and \u03c7. This shows that the gradient and potential\nportions of the energy do not contribute equally, the difference being proportional to the Lorentz violating coefficient\n\u03b2.\nIn order to obtain first-order differential equations whose solutions are also solutions of the equations of motion we\nuse the Bogomol'nyi approach [12], looking at the energy density T 00 and trying to extract simple conditions that\nminimize the total energy. We introduce a smooth function W = W (\u03c6, \u03c7) and consider the ansatz\n\u03c6\u2032 = W \u03c6 + s1 \u03c7\u2032 ,\n\n(8a)\n\n\u03c7\u2032 = W \u03c7 + s2 \u03c6\u2032 .\n\n(8b)\n\nSubstituting this into Eqs.

(8), we have T 00 \u2261 \u01eb = dW/dx, and the\ntotal energy E is minimized to the value\nZ \u221e\nE=\n\u01eb(x)dx = |\u2206W |.\n(9)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\f3\nIn the remaining of this section we take s1 = s2 = \u03b2. Explicitly, the ansatz given by Eq. (8) results in two first-order\ndifferential equations that minimize the energy\n1\n(W\u03c6 + \u03b2W\u03c7 )\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n1\n\u03c7\u2032 =\n(W\u03c7 + \u03b2W\u03c6 )\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\u03c6\u2032 =\n\n(10a)\n(10b)\n\nNote that Eq. (7) can be written as\n1\nV (\u03c6, \u03c7) =\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 2 1 2\nW + W + \u03b2W\u03c6 W\u03c7 ,\n2 \u03c6 2 \u03c7\n\n(11)\n\nand for \u03b2 2 < 1, which concur with the fact that any Lorentz violating parameter should be very small, the potential\nis positive. The simplest solutions for the equation (10) are the homogeneous solution. These solution can be found\nusing the W\u03c6 = W\u03c7 = 0 that are minima of potential.\nA.\n\nAn Example\n\nNow we will consider a particular potential. We choose the function W introduced in Ref. [6]\n1\nW (\u03c6, \u03c7) = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c63 \u2212 r\u03c6\u03c72\n3\n\n(12)\n\ncorresponding to the potential\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n2\n2 2\n2 2 2\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 r\u03c7 ) + 2r \u03c6 \u03c7 \u2212 2r\u03b2\u03c6\u03c7(1 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 r\u03c7 )\n(13)\nV (\u03c6, \u03c7) =\n1 \u2212 \u03b22 2\np\nThis potential depends explicitly on \u03b2, but the minima are (\u03c6, \u03c7) = (0, \u00b1 1/r) and (\u03c6, \u03c7) = (\u00b11, 0) and they do\nnot depend of \u03b2. These points correspond\nto the following values\np\np of W : P1 = (\u03c6, \u03c7) = (\u22121, 0) \u21d2 W1 = \u22122/3;\nP2 = (1, 0) \u21d2 W2 = 2/3; P3 = (0, 1/r) \u21d2 W3 = 0; P4 = (0, \u2212 1/r) \u21d2 W4 = 0. In this way we can possibly have\nfive BPS sectors connecting P1 \u2194 P2 , P1 \u2194 P3 , P1 \u2194 P4 , P2 \u2194 P3 , P2 \u2194 P4 and one non-BPS sector connecting\nP3 \u2194 P4 .\nNow we analyze Eqs. (10) on the (\u03c6, \u03c7) plane, looking for explicit solutions. Those equations reduce, in the model\nconsidered here, to the following first-order equations for the fields:\n1\n[1 \u2212 \u03c62 \u2212 r\u03c72 \u2212 2\u03b2r\u03c6\u03c7]\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n1\n[\u22122r\u03c6\u03c7 + \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03c62 \u2212 r\u03c72 )]\n\u03c7\u2032 =\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n\u03c6\u2032 =\n\n(14a)\n(14b)\n\nThe case \u03b2 = 0 lead to\n\u03c6\u2032 = 1 \u2212 \u03c62 \u2212 r\u03c72 ,\n\u03c7\u2032 = \u22122r\u03c6\u03c7,\n\n(15a)\n(15b)\n\nwhich can be integrated to give the general orbit constraint\n\u03c62 =\n\nr\n1\n\u03c72 + C\u03c7 r + 1\n2r \u2212 1\n\n(16)\n\nr\nA special case is the elliptic orbit for C = 0, with \u03c62 + 1\u22122r\n\u03c72 = 1. As this particular orbit connects the minimum\nenergy points P1 and P2 , it is of particular interest with explicit solutions\nr\n1\n\u03c6(x) = tanh(2rx),\n\u03c7(x) =\n\u2212 2 sech(2rx)\n(17)\nr\n\nAnother special orbit is the line \u03c7 = 0 (C \u2192 \u221e). In this case, we take \u03c6(x) = tanh(x).\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Profile of the orbits in the (\u03c6, \u03c7) plane, given by Eqs. (14), for \u03b2 = 1/3 and r = 1/3. The orbit in black (dot-dashed\nline) corresponds to odd solutions, which have the symmetry \u03c6(\u2212x) = \u2212\u03c6(x) and \u03c7(\u2212x) = \u2212\u03c7(x).\n\nWe have been unable to find explicit solutions for general nonvanishing values of \u03b2. However, numerically we could\nobtain orbits and the corresponding solutions \u03c6(x) and \u03c7(x). In Fig. 1, we plot the orbit profile of the Eqs. (14). The\ngreen (solid) lines connect the minima P1 and P2 . The blue (dashed) lines connect the minima P1 and P2 to P3 and\nP4 . Note that, in contrast with the case of vanishing \u03b2, there is no solution with one constant field.\nWe plot three pair of solutions in the next three figures, and in Fig. 2 we show that the \u03c6(x) (left panel) and \u03c7(x)\n(center panel) solutions are related to the central orbit highlighted in black in Fig. 1, which connects P 1 and P 2.\nThe right panel shows the energy density, and we note that there are two small energy peaks in addition to the large\ncentral peak. These solutions have energy EB = 4/3. In Fig. 3, we show the solutions and the respective energy\ndensity related to the orbit connecting P 1 and P 3. The \u03c6 solution is not a monotonic function anymore, with a\nminimum at x \u2248 3.5. Finally, in Fig. 4, we show the solutions that connect P 2 and P 3. We note that, in contrast\nwith the \u03b2 = 0 case, the BPS solutions that connects P 1 to P 3 do not have the same form as the BPS solution that\nconnects P 2 to P 3, as we can see in Fig. 3 and in Fig. 4. Nevertheless, both solutions have the same energy EB = 2/3.\n\nFIG. 2: The \u03c6(x) (left panel) and \u03c7(x) (right panel) solutions and energy density (right panel), for \u03b2 = 1/3 and r = 1/3.

However , we will present a perturbative analysis\nfor \u03b2 \u226a 1 in Sect. IV.\nIII.\n\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS\n\nIn order to analyze the stability of the solutions, one should start with the full partial differential equations (2a)\nand (2b). For \u03b1 = 0, for simplicity, we get to\n\u03c6\u0308 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 + \u03b2(\u03c7\u0308 + \u03c7\u2032\u2032 ) + dV /d\u03c6 = 0,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c7\u0308 \u2212 \u03c7 + \u03b2(\u03c6\u0308 + \u03c6 ) + dV /d\u03c7 = 0,\n\n(18a)\n(18b)\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the Lorentz violation does not jeopardize the linear stability of the differential equations,\nwhich turns stable the associated kinks solutions. Such demonstration is performed according to the usual way. With\n\n\f5\nthis purpose, we consider general fluctuations, \u03b7, \u03be, on the field configurations:\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6(x) + \u03b7(x, t),\n\n\u03c7(x, t) = \u03c7(x) + \u03be(x, t).\n\n(19)\n\nWith this, the differential equations (18) take the form\n\u03b12 \u03b7\u0308 \u2212 \u03b11 \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 + V\u03c61 \u03c61 \u03b7 + V\u03c61 \u03c62 \u03be = 0,\n\u03b11 \u03be \u0308 \u2212 \u03b12 \u03be \u2032\u2032 + V\u03c61 \u03c62 \u03b7 + V\u03c62 \u03c62 \u03be = 0.\n\n(20a)\n(20b)\n\nwhere \u03b11 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2), \u03b12 = (1 + \u03b2) and\n1\n\u03c61 = \u221a (\u03c6 + \u03c7),\n2\n\n1\n\u03c62 = \u221a (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c7),\n2\n\n(21)\n\nFIG. 3: The same as in Fig. 2, for solutions that connect the points P 1 and P 3.\n\nFIG. 4: The same as in Fig. 2, for solutions that connect P 2 and P 3.\n\nSuch system may be written in a matrix form: we use \u03b7(x, t) = \u03b7(x) cos(\u03c9t) and \u03be(x, t) = \u03be(x) cos(\u03c9t) to get\n\nH\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03b7\n\u03be\n\n\u0015\n\n= \u03c92\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03b12 \u03b7\n\u03b11 \u03be\n\n\u0015\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\nH=\n\n\"\n\n2\n\nd\n\u2212\u03b11 dx\nV\u03c61 \u03c62\n2 + V\u03c61 \u03c61\nd2\n\u2212\u03b12 dx2 + V\u03c62 \u03c62\nV\u03c61 \u03c62\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nFinally, it is possible to show that H = S \u2020 S, with:\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u221a d\n\u2212 \u03b11 dx + p1 W\u03c61 \u03c61\np W\n\u221a 2d \u03c61 \u03c62\n.\n(24)\nS=\n\u2212 \u03b12 dx + p2 W\u03c62 \u03c62\np1 W\u03c61 \u03c62\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith p1 = a \u03b11 , p2 = b \u03b12 . Eq. (22) is not an eigenvalue equation but its structure is enough to demonstrate\nstability. Indeed, such equation may be written as H|\u03a8i = \u03c9n2 M |\u03a8i, where M is a diagonal 2 \u00d7 2 matrix with\nM11 = \u03b12 , M22 = \u03b11 . Considering the internal product h\u03a8|H|\u03a8i = h\u03a8|S \u2020 S|\u03a8i = |S|\u03a8i|2 , we obtain |S|\u03a8i|2 =\n\n\f6\n\u03c9n2 (\u03b12 |\u03b7|2 + \u03b11 |\u03be|2 ), which assures positivity of \u03c9 2 , since \u03b11 , \u03b12 > 0. The positivity of \u03c9 2 implies real values for \u03c9,\nwhich yields well behaved solutions for any time, meaning stability.\nAnother study concerns the propagation of traveling waves in this model of two coupled fields. First of all, we note\nfrom Eqs. (18) that\n\u03b12 \u03c6\u03081 \u2212 \u03b11 \u03c6\u2032\u20321 + dV /d\u03c61 = 0,\n\u03b11 \u03c6\u03082 \u2212 \u03b12 \u03c6\u2032\u20322 + dV /d\u03c62 = 0,\n\n(25a)\n(25b)\n\nIf such a model entails the presence of traveling waves, then there should exist moving waves endowed with the same\nform as the static solutions, which satisfy \u03b11 \u03c6\u2032\u20321 = dV /d\u03c61 , \u03b12 \u03c6\u2032\u20322 = dV /d\u03c62 . In order to properly examine this issue,\nthe fields are written in the form \u03c61 = \u03c61 (u1 ), \u03c62 = \u03c62 (u2 ), with u1 = \u03b31 (x \u2212 v1 t), u2 = \u03b32 (x \u2212 v2 t), where \u03b31 , \u03b32\nbeing constants and v1 , and v2 represent the propagation velocities. Replacing \u03c61 (u1 ), \u03c62 (u2 ) into eqs. (25), one gets\n\u03b11 d2 \u03c61 /du2 = dV /d\u03c61 ,\n2\n\n2\n\n(26a)\n\n\u03b12 d \u03c62 /du = dV /d\u03c62 ,\n\n(26b)\n\n\u03b31 = [1 \u2212 (\u03b12 /\u03b11 )v12 ]\u22121/2 , \u03b32 = [1 \u2212 (\u03b11 /\u03b12 )v22 ]\u22121/2 .\n\n(27)\n\nafter making the following identification\n\nThe attainment of Eqs. (26a,26b) confirms that this model supports traveling waves. The phase velocity (vph = \u03c9/k)\n2\n2\nof such waves is given by the dispersion relations\ncoming from\np the free version of Eqs. (25a,25b), \u2212\u03b12 k + \u03b11 \u03c9 = 0,\np\n2\n2\n\u2212\u03b11 k + \u03b12 \u03c9 = 0, which implies v1 = \u00b1 \u03b12 /\u03b11 , v2 = \u00b1 \u03b11 /\u03b12 . Considering the redefinitions (21), the stationary\nwave configurations associated with the fields \u03c6, \u03c7 are composed by two travelling waves of velocities v1 , v2 . It is\ninteresting to note that v2 < 1 while v1 > 1, and that this outcome prevails for the group velocity as well, with\nvg2 < 1 while vg1 > 1.\nIV.\n\nANALYTICAL METHOD FOR PERTURBED SOLUTIONS\n\nTaking into account that Lorentz violation is a small effect, a perturbative approach is well suited to deal with\nit. In this sense, an analytical method may be used to construct explicit first-order solutions for the differential\nequations (18) constrained to the situation where the LV parameter \u03b2 is small (since its presence is addressed as a\nperturbation on the Lorentz symmetric case). In order to obtain first order analytical solutions, we should first define\nthe unperturbed system (\u03b2 = 0) as\n\u03c6\u0308 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 + dV /d\u03c6 = 0,\n\u03c7\u0308 \u2212 \u03c7\u2032\u2032 + dV /d\u03c7 = 0,\n\n(28a)\n(28b)\n\nwhich provides unperturbed solutions (labeled as \u03c60 and \u03c70 ), whose form depend on the adopted potential V. In this\nsection we consider V (\u03c6, \u03c7) = V1 (\u03c6) + V2 (\u03c7), which makes the above equations uncoupled.\nIn the static perturbed case, the differential equations are:\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + \u03b2\u03c7\u2032\u2032 + dV /d\u03c6 = 0,\n\u2212\u03c7\u2032\u2032 + \u03b2\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + dV /d\u03c7 = 0.\n\n(29a)\n(29b)\n\nNote that these equations are coupled only by \u03b2-dependent terms. In order to solve it, we propose the following\nansatz\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c60 (x) + \u03b2g(x),\n\n\u03c7(x) = \u03c70 (x) + \u03b2f (x),\n\n(30)\n\nwhere g and f are functions to be determined. Replacing such ansatz in eqs. (29a,29b), it results\n\u2212g \u2032\u2032 + \u03c7\u2032\u20320 + gd2 V /d\u03c62 |\u03c60 = 0,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2212f +\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u20320\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+ f d V /d\u03c7 |\u03c70 = 0,\n\n(31a)\n(31b)\n\nwhere \u03c60 and \u03c70 are the corresponding unperturbed solutions. These are second-order differential equations, whose\nsolutions may be achieved in an analytical form for certain potentials. Aa a first example, let us consider the potential\nsuch that\nV1 (\u03c6) = (1 \u2212 \u03c62 )2 /2,\n\nV2 (\u03c7) = (1 \u2212 \u03c72 )2 /2,\n\n(32a)\n\n\f7\nwhich provides the well-known solutions, \u03c60 (x) = \u00b1 tanh(x), \u03c70 (x) = \u00b1 tanh(x), besides the homogeneous ones:\n\u03c60 (x) = \u03c70 (x) = \u00b11, 0. In this way, Eqs. (31a)-(31b) give\n\u2212g \u2032\u2032 + \u03c7\u2032\u20320 + g(\u22122 + 6\u03c620 ) = 0,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2212f +\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u20320\n\n+ f (\u22122 +\n\n6\u03c720 )\n\n= 0.\n\n(33a)\n(33b)\n\nA first situation consists in choosing \u03c60 (x) = \u00b1 tanh(x), \u03c70 (x) = \u00b11, which leads to the system of equations\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2212g \u2032\u2032 + g(6 tanh2 x \u2212 2) = 0,\n2\n\n\u2212f \u2213 2 tanh x sech x + 4f = 0.\n\n(34a)\n(34b)\n\nUnder the boundary conditions (dg/dx)|x\u2192\u221e = (df /dx)|x\u2192\u221e = 0, g(0) = a, f (0) = b, such system supports an exact\nanalytical solution given as follows\ng(x) = a sech2 x,\nf (x) = be\n\n\u22122x\n\n(35a)\n\n\u00b1 2[1 \u2212 ln(2 cosh x)] sinh 2x \u00b1 2x cosh 2x \u2213 tanh x(1 + 2 cosh 2x).\n\n(35b)\n\nWith this, the classical solutions for the Lorentz-violating system are determined at first order in accordance with\neqs. (30).\nA second case is \u03c60 (x) = \u00b1 tanh(x), \u03c70 (x) = tanh(x) with the conditions (dg/dx)|x\u2192\u221e = (df /dx)|x\u2192\u221e = 0,\ng(0) = a, f (0) = b, which gives\ng(x) = (a + x/2) sech2 x,\n\nf (x) = (b \u00b1 x/2) sech2 x.\n\n(36)\n\nOnce we have obtained first-order analytical solutions, it is also possible to carry out the corresponding first-order\nenergy corrections for the solutions already known. The starting point is the energy density given by eq. (5), written\nfor eqs. (30), which implies T 00 = T000 + T\u03b200 , where:\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 \u20322\n\u03c60 + \u03c7\u20322\n0 + 2V (\u03c6, \u03c7)\n2\n= \u03b2[\u03c6\u20320 g \u2032 + \u03c7\u20320 f \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\u20320 \u03c7\u20320 + V\u03c6 g + V\u03c7 f ].\n\nT 00 =\n\n(37a)\n\nT\u03b200\n\n(37b)\n\nHere, T000 is the usual energy density (without Lorentz-violation) and T\u03b200 is the first-order correction due to Lorentz\nviolation. Now, using the potentials of Eqs. (32a)a-(32a)b, the energy correction takes the form\nT\u03b200 = \u03b2[\u03c6\u20320 g \u2032 + \u03c7\u20320 f \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\u20320 \u03c7\u20320 \u2212 2\u03c60 (1 \u2212 \u03c620 )g \u2212 2\u03c70 (1 \u2212 \u03c720 )f ].\n\n(38)\n\nA first case whose energy is to be analyzed is the one in which \u03c60 (x) = \u00b1 tanh(x), \u03c70 (x) = \u00b11. In this case, the\ncorresponding solutions are given by eqs. (35a,35b), which lead to the following result\nT000 = sech2 x,\nT\u03b200\n\n(39a)\n4\n\n= \u2213\u03b2[6a tanh x sech x].\n\n(39b)\n\nR\u221e\nThe energy associated with this density, E = \u2212\u221e T\u03b200 dx, is zero, since one has to integrate an odd function. Hence,\nR\u221e\nthe energy is simply the one of the usual case (without LV): E = \u2212\u221e T000 dx = 4/3. This means that the energy does\nnot change up to first-order in \u03b2.\nThe second case is given by \u03c60 (x) = \u00b1 tanh(x) and \u03c70 (x) = tanh(x), whose solutions are given by eqs. (??,36). In\nthis case, one gets\nT000 = 2 sech2 x,\n4\u03b2\nT\u03b200 = \u2213 [x tanh x sech4 x].\n3\n\n(40a)\n(40b)\n\nThe associated energy correction is then equal to \u22134\u03b2/3, with total energy being given by E = 4(2 \u2213 \u03b2)/3. Here the\nenergy receives first-order correction in \u03b2.\n\n\f8\nV.\n\nENDING COMMENTS\n\nIn this work, we have studied the effects of a Lorentz-violating tensor term on the topological defects associated with\nmodels described by two real scalar fields. We applied the Bogomol'nyi approach to successfully attain first-order\ndifferential equations whose solutions minimize the energy and solve the equations of motion. This simplification\nis extremely useful to study numerically the solutions in phase space. We studied a model where the potential\ndescribing the two scalar fields presents nonlinear couplings between the fields, with a rich structure of minima. As\nwe have shown, for general values of the parameter which implements the Lorentz breaking, a numerical investigation\nwas performed, and we have found numerical solutions connecting minima of the potential. For general models, we\nperformed a stability analysis to show that the solutions of the equations of motion are well behaved in time. Also, we\nhave shown that the models support traveling waves in general. Since we where not able to find explicit solutions for\ngeneral values of \u03b2, we studied the case with \u03b2 \u226a 1, which concur with the fact that the Lorentz breaking should be\nvery small. In this case, we proposed an ansatz for the perturbed solutions, finding explicit solutions for the special\ncase where the potential is described by the two fields \u03c6 and \u03c7, that do not interact with each other.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors express their gratitude to CAPES, CNPq, FAPEMA and PADCT-MCT-CNPq for financial support.\n\n[1] V.
