It is shown that dual\nsuperconductivity of the vacuum or absence of it is an intrinsic property of QCD\nvacuum, independent of the choice of the abelian projection. The order of the\ndeconfining phase transition in Nf = 2 QCD is studied as a key to understand the\nmechanism of confinement.\n\n1. Dual superconductivity: dependence on the abelian\nprojection.\nThe mechanism of confinement by dual superconductivity of the vacuum\nrequires the identification in QCD of a U(1) fiber bundle, which has to be\ncolor gauge invariant and color singlet if color is not broken by monopole\ncondensation in the vacuum. The procedure for that is known as \"Abelian\nProjection\" 2 .\nA disorder parameter is then introduced3,4 , h\u03bci which is the vev of a\nmagnetically charged operator \u03bc . h\u03bci =\n6 0 means Higgs breaking of the\nmagnetic U(1) gauge symmetry, or dual superconducticity, and is expected\nto hold in the confined phase T < Tc . For T > Tc (deconfined phase)\ninstead the U (1) is not broken and h\u03bci = 0.\nIt can be instructive to start from the SU(N) Higgs model, which is\ndefined by the Lagrangean\n1\n\n1\nL = \u2212 T r{G\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd } \u2212 T r{D\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03c6} \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n4\n\n(1)\n\nThe Higgs field \u03c6 is a N by N matrix and transforms in the adjoint representation.

If U (x) is defined\nas the gauge transformation which diagonalizes the Higgs field \u03c6(x), then\n\u03c6a (x) is diagonal with \u03c6(x) , but any other choice provides an abelian\nprojection : for example \u03c6a (x) can be diagonal in the maximal abelian\ngauge.\n\u03bca depends on the choice of U(x)\n\u03bca (~x, t) = ei\n\nR\n\n\u2020\n~ y,t)U(~\nd3 y\n~ T r (\u03c6a\ny ,t)E(~\ny ,t))~b\u22a5 (~\nx\u2212~\ny)\ndiag U (~\n\n(15)\n\nIf U (x) does not depend on the gauge field configuration, when computing correlators of \u03bca it can be reabsorbed by a change of variables which\nleaves the measure invariant10 ,and\n\u03bca (~x, t) = ei\n\nR\n\n~ y ,t))~b\u22a5 (~\nd3 y\n~ T r (\u03c6a\nx\u2212~\ny)\ndiag E(~\n\n(16)\n\nAll memory of U (x) has disappeared, and h\u03bca i 6= 0 or h\u03bca i = 0 are statements independent on the abelian projection.\nIf U (x) depends on A\u03bc (x) in general the measure is not invariant and a\nnon trivial jacobian can appear after gauge transformation by U (x), so that\nthe correlation functions of \u03bca , and in particular its vev are projection dependent. However if the number density of monopoles is finite the operator\n\u03bca (x) defined by eq(16) will create a monopole in all abelian projections,\nsince the gauge transformation to any abelian projection will be continuous\nin a neighbourhood of x and will preserve topology. Hence, if the number\ndensity of monopoles is finite the statement h\u03bca i 6= 0 and h\u03bca i = 0 are\nabelian projection independent10,11 .\nDual superconductivity (or non-superconductivity) of the vacuum is an\nintrinsic property, independent on the particular choice of the abelian projection.\nIn QCD there are no Higgs fields, but, as discussed above, any operator\nin the adjoint representation O(x) can provide an abelian projection, in\nthe sense that the operator U (x) of eq(2) can be chosen as the one which\ndiagonalizes O(x). Again, if the number density of monopoles is finite dual\nsupercondutivity is an intrinsic property, independent of the choice of the\nabelian projection. The density of monopoles can be estimated by looking\nat the distribution of the difference of the eigenvalues of any operator in the\nadjoint representation on the sites of a lattice.

Instead of h\u03bca i one determines the quantity\nd\nlnh\u03bca i. \u03c1a is a susceptibility. At the deconfining transition where\n\u03c1a \u2261 d\u03b2\na\nh\u03bc i has a sharp drop \u03c1a has a negative peak. A phase transition can only\ntake place in the infinite volume limit12 . As the volume increases the drop\nof h\u03bca i becomes sharper and sharper and the negative peak of \u03c1 higher and\nhigher.

For T > Tc \u03c1 \u223c \u2212|c|Ns with Ns the spatial extension of the lattice, implying that h\u03bca i = 0 strictly in the thermodynamical\nlimit (normal vacuum). In the critical region the correlation length \u03be goes\nlarge ,the ratio of the lattice spacing a to \u03be, a/\u03be can be put to zero, and\nthen the disorder parameter only depends on the ratio Ns /\u03be\nh\u03bca i = \u03c4 \u03b4 \u03c6(Ns /\u03be)\n\n(18)\n\nwhence the scaling law follows\n\u03c1a /Ns1/\u03bd = f (\u03c4 Ns1/\u03bd )\n\n(19)\n\n1/\u03bd\nNs )\n\nIn particular the peak height scales as\nwhence \u03bd can be determined.\nThe result is consistent4 with the values obtained by use of the Polyakov\nline14,15 , or \u03bd = .62 for pure gauge SU (2) (3d ising universality class) , and\n.33 for SU (3), first order transition.\n2. Two flavor QCD.\nIn quenched theory one uses the Polyakov criterion to define confinement,\nwhich refers to the static potential between a quark and an antiquark.\nThe order parameter is hLi the Polyakov line : when hLi = 0 the\npotential grows linearly with distance, when hLi 6= 0 it goes to a constant.\n\n\fOctober 28, 2018\n\n3:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nconf2003\n\n7\n\nOf course one should in principle show that confinement defined in this\nway implies the absence of any colored particle in asymptotic states, which\nis not easy to do, but the criterion is reasonable anyway. As shown above\nit fits with identifying confinement with dual superconductivity of the vacuum.\nIn the presence of dynamical quarks Z3 symmetry is explicitely broken and hLi cannot be an order parameter. Moreover string breaking is\nexpected to occur: the potential energy stops growing with distance, due\nto the instability for production of quark antiquark pairs,even if there is\nconfinement. At mq = 0 there is chiral symmetry, which is known to be\nspontaneously broken at zero temperature, the pseudoscalar mesons being\nthe Goldstone particles. The symmetry is restored at some temperature Tc ,\nwhere the order parameter h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i goes to zero. It is not known what is the\nrelation between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. In any case\nat mq 6= 0 chiral symmetry is explicitely broken and h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i is not an order\nparameter either. The situation for Nf = 2 mu = md = m is depicted in\nfig 2.\nA number of susceptibilities can be measures on the lattice as functions\nof the temperature T at given m ( The susceptibility of h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i, that of hLi,the\nspecific heat17,18 ). All of them show a peak at the same T (m), which defines\nthe curve in the phase diagram of fig 2. By convention the region below\nthat curve is called confined, the region above it deconfined.\nA renormalization group analysis can be made16 of the chiral transition\nassuming that the Goldstone particles are the relevant degrees of freedom at\nthe transition , with the following result. For Nf = 3 the chiral transition is\nfirst order and such is the transition at m 6= 0. For Nf = 2 if the anomaly\nof the U(1) axial current vanishes below Tc the transition is first order and\nsuch is the transition at m 6= 0; if instead the anomaly persists up to Tc\nthe transition is second order in the universality class of O(4) and the line\nat m 6= 0 is a crossover. Lattice data are not yet conclusive on this issue,\nbut for some reason the second possibility is usually assumed to be true.\nA possible criterion for confinement could be dual superconductivity of\nthe vacuum, which is already valid in the quenched case. Indeed the disorder parameter h\u03bca i can equally well be defined in the presence of dynamical\nquarks. Lattice simulations show19 in fact that h\u03bca i is non zero below the\ncritical line of fig 2, and is stricly zero above it in the thermodynamical\nlimit. Of course in principle one should show that dual superconductivity\nimplies absence of colored particles in asymptotic states, which is not trivial\nto do: but the situation is not different from that of the Polyakov criterion,\n\n\fOctober 28, 2018\n\n3:58\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nconf2003\n\n8\n\nas discussed in the previous section.\nA finite size scaling analysis around Tc can be performed to get information on the order of the phase transition. The issue is very relevant to\nunderstand confinement. Indeed if the determination gives a result consistent with what is obtained by studying the specific heat a legitimation\nresults for h\u03bca i as an order parameter and for dual superconductivity as\na mechanism of confinement. Preliminary data20 indicate that the chiral\ntransition is first order and certainly not in the universality class of O(4). A\ncareful analysis is being completed, which will give an unambiguous answer\nto the question. A careful analysis of the anomaly around Tc is also on the\nway to check consistency with ref.16 . Some details on the analysis. A new\nscale is present in the problem with respect to the quenched case. Eq(18)\nnow reads\nh\u03bca i = \u03c6(Ns /\u03be, mNsyh )\n\n(20)\n\nThe problem can be reduced to a single scale by choosing masses and sizes\nsuch that mNsyh = constant , assuming for yh alternatively the value corresponding to O(4) universality class (yh = 2.49) or the value for a first order\ntransition yh = 3. For the same values different susceptibilities and the\nspecific heat can be determined, and the critical indices can be measured\nconsistently. This program is being completed.\nThanks are due J.M.
