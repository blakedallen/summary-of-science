We study the separability of the Neumann-Rosochatius\nsystem on the n-dimensional sphere using the geometry of biHamiltonian manifolds. Its well-known separation variables are\nrecovered by means of a separability condition relating the Hamiltonian with a suitable (1, 1) tensor field on the sphere. This also\nallows us to iteratively construct the integrals of motion of the\nsystem.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Neumann system is among the widest known and best studied\nintegrable systems in Mathematical Physics. It decribes the dynamics\nof a point particle constrained to move on the\nsphere S n , under the\nPn+1\n1\ninfluence of a quadratic potential V (x) = 2 i=1 \u03b1i x2i , \u03b1i 6= \u03b1j . In\n1859, Carl Neumann [20] showed that the equations of motion of the\n\"physical\" n = 2 case could be solved using the Jacobi theory of separation of variables. It was noticed by Rosochatius (see [22]) that a\npotential given by the sum (with nonnegative weights) of the inverses\nof the squares of the (Cartesian) coordinates can be added without losing the separability property. The system so obtained is customarily\ncalled the Neumann-Rosochatius (NR) system.\nMore than one century later this separability result was generalized\nto the arbitrary n case by Moser [19]. The starting point to solve the\nproblem was the ingenious introduction of a special set of coordinates\non S n , called spheroconical (or elliptical spherical) coordinates (already\nused, for n = 2, by Neumann). They are defined as follows: For given\nsets of real numbers \u03b11 < \u03b11 < * * * < \u03b1n+1 and nonzero x1 , . . . , xn+1 ,\nthe coordinates \u03bba (x), a = 1, . . . , n, are the solutions of the equation\n(1.1)\n\nn+1\nX\ni=1\n\nx2i\n=0.\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1i\n\nAMS Subject Classification: 37K10, 53D17,70H20\nKeywords: Bi-Hamiltonian manifolds, Separation of variables, Spectral Curves\nSISSA Preprint 62/2003/FM\n1\n\n\f2\n\nC. BARTOCCI, G. FALQUI, AND M. PEDRONI\n\nLater on, it was shown that the NR system could be framed within\nthe formalism of Lax pairs and r-matrices (see, e.g., [1, 12]).

We will follow\na recently introduced set up for the theory of separation of variables\nfor the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. In a nutshell, such a framework\ncan be described as follows. One considers a symplectic manifold M\nendowed with a (1, 1) tensor field N with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion\n(which we will call an \u03c9N manifold , provided that a compatibility condition between N and the symplectic form is satisfied); under suitable\nhypotheses, N selects a special subclass of canonical coordinates on M\n(called Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates) that have the property of diagonalizing N. The condition for the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation associated with a Hamiltonian H can be given, according\nto the bi-Hamiltonian theory of separation of variables, the following\nintrinsic formulation. One considers the distribution DH generated\niteratively by the action of N on the Hamiltonian vector field XH associated with H, and the two\u2013form d(N \u2217 dH). Then XH is separable\nin the Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates associated with N if and only if\n(1.7)\n\nd(N \u2217 dH)(DH , DH ) = 0.\n\nThis scheme, in its basic features, has already been considered in the\nliterature [5, 17, 10, 15, 11] and applied to various systems (see, e.g,\n[9, 7, 3, 18]); it is fair to say that, in these papers, the \u03c9N manifold structure is fixed \"a priori\", and that equation (1.7) is seen as a\ncondition that selects those Hamiltonians which are separable in the\n\"preassigned\" Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates.\nIn the present paper we will take a different logical standpoint: We\nwill consider a given Hamiltonian H (namely, the NR Hamiltonian)\nand look at (1.7) as an equation to determine N (and hence the separation coordinates). We shall see that it is indeed possible (and, actually, easy) to solve such an equation by means of a couple of natural\nAns\u00e4tze, thus arriving to induce from H the separation coordinates.\nAlso, we shall show how the iterative structure naturally associated\nwith the (generalized) recursion relations defined by N allow to recursively construct the additional integrals of motion ensuring complete\nintegrability. Finally, we will make contact with the \"Lax\" approach\nto the separability of the Neumann-Rosochatius system showing that\n\n\f4\n\nC. BARTOCCI, G. FALQUI, AND M. PEDRONI\n\nthe separation relations tying Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates and these\nintegrals are nothing but the spectral curve relations (1.6).\nObviously enough, the conditions on N coming from (1.7), in their\nfull generality, are too difficult to be solved. The couple of Ans\u00e4tze\nwhich will enable us to solve them for the NR case are the following.\nThe first one is suggested from the fact that the phase space of the NR\nsystem is a cotangent bundle; accordingly, we will seek for a special \u03c9N\nmanifold structure on T \u2217 S n , defined by a (1, 1) tensor N induced by\na suitable tensor (with zero torsion) L on the base manifold S n . The\nsecond one will be to use a special form of equation (1.7), that reads\n\u0001\n1\n(1.8)\nd N \u2217 dH \u2212 tr(N) \u2227 dH = 0.\n2\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we will collect some\nnotions of the theory of \u03c9N manifolds, and briefly discuss the biHamiltonian theorem for separation of variables. In Section 3 we will\nsolve equations (1.8), thus showing that the geometry of \u03c9N manifolds can be used to discover the separation variables of the NeumannRosochatius (NR) system. In Section 4 we will find the St\u00e4ckel separation relations and the family of commuting integrals of the system.\nAcknowledgments.

The \u03c9N framework\nIn this section we wish to recall some basic properties of a special\nclass of bi-Hamiltonian manifolds, called \u03c9N manifolds. For a more\ndetailed description we refer to [16, 11]. By definition, an \u03c9N manifold\nis a smooth manifold M endowed with a pair of compatible Poisson\nbivectors P0 , P1 such that one of them (say, P0 ) is nondegenerate.\n(Compatibility means that any linear combination of P0 and P1 is a\nPoisson bivector.) One can construct a recursion operator N = P1 P0\u22121,\nwhose Nijenhius torsion,\n(2.1) T (N)(X, Y ) = [NX, NY ] \u2212 N([NX, Y ] + [X, NY ] \u2212 N[X, Y ]) ,\nvanishes as a straightforward consequence of the compatibility between\nP0 and P1 (see, e.g., [14]). We set 2n = dim M and we denote by \u03c90 the\nsymplectic structure associated to P0 , and by {*, *}0, {*, *}1 the Poisson\nbrackets associated, respectively, to P0 , P1 .\n\n\fSEPARABILITY OF THE NR SYSTEM\n\n5\n\nThe relevance of \u03c9N manifolds in the theory of separable systems\nis mainly due to the existence, under suitable hypotheses, of a special class of canonical coordinates, that are selected by the geometric\nstructure of the system itself.\nDefinition 1. A system of local coordinates (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yn ) that\nare canonical w.r.t. the symplectic form \u03c90 is said to be DarbouxNijenhuis if the matrix expressing N in these coordinates is diagonal,\ni.e.,\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\n\u2202\n\u2202\nN=\n\u03bbi\n\u2297 dxi + \u03bdi\n\u2297 dyi .\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\ni\ni\ni=1\nNotice that, since NP0 is antisymmetric, it follows that \u03bbi = \u03bdi for all\ni. In general, however, the eigenvalues \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn need not be distinct.\nOn the cotangent bundle of any differentiable manifold there is an\nelegant way to construct \u03c9N structures admitting Darboux-Nijenhuis\ncoordinates through the following procedure [13]. Let Q be an ndimensional manifold equipped with a type (1, 1) tensor field L, whose\nNijenhuis torsion vanishes. Let \u03b80 be the Liouville 1-form and \u03c90 = d\u03b80\nthe standard symplectic 2-form on T \u2217 Q; the associated Poisson structure will be denoted P0 . By thinking of L as an endomorphism of T Q,\none can deform the Liouville 1-form to a 1-form \u03b8L :\nh\u03b8L , Zi\u03b1 = h\u03b1, L(\u03c0\u2217 Z)i\u03c0(\u03b1) ,\nfor any vector field Z on T \u2217 Q and for any 1-form \u03b1 on Q, where\n\u03c0 : T \u2217 Q \u2192 Q is the canonical projection.P If we choose local coordinates (x1 , . . . , xn ) on Q and set L(X) = ni,j=1 Lij X j \u2202x\u2202 i , we get the\nP\nlocal expression \u03b8L = ni,j=1 Lij yi dxj w.r.t. the standard symplectic coordinates (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yn ) on T \u2217 Q. The complete lift of L is the\nendomorphism N of T (T \u2217 Q) uniquely determined by the condition\n(2.2)\n\nd\u03b8L (X, Y ) = \u03c90 (NX, Y ) ,\n\nfor all vector fields X, Y on T \u2217 Q. An easy computation shows that:\nn\n\n(2.3)\n\nN(\n\n(2.4)\n\nN(\n\nn\n\nX\nX \u2202Ll\n\u2202\n\u2202Llk \u2202\ni\ni \u2202\nLk\nyl (\n)=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n)\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xi \u2202yi\ni\ni\nn\n\nX\n\u2202\n\u2202\n)=\nLki\n.\n\u2202yk\n\u2202y\ni\ni\n\nSince L has vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, the same property holds for\nthe type (1, 1) tensor field N on T \u2217 Q [23, Prop. 5.6, p. 36], and\n\n\f6\n\nC. BARTOCCI, G. FALQUI, AND M. PEDRONI\n\n(T \u2217 Q, P0 , P1 := NP0 ) is an \u03c9N manifold [13].

By the very definition, if XH is the\n(1)\nHamiltonian vector field associated to H w.r.t. P1 , then XH = NXH .\nNotice that, in general, this vector field need not be Hamiltonian or\neven locally Hamiltonian w.r.t. \u03c90 . Indeed, the 1-form N \u2217 dH may fail\nto be closed (here N \u2217 is the adjoint of the endomorphism N), and one\nhas\n(2.5)\n\nLN XH \u03c90 = \u2212d(N \u2217 dH) = LXH \u03c91 .\n\nIn fact, from (2.2) it follows that (N \u2217 dF )(Y ) = \u2212\u03c90 (NXH , Y ) =\n\u2212\u03c91 (XH , Y ).\nLet us now assume that L has n functionally independent eigenvalues\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn . Since L is torsionless, these eigenvalues determine local\ncoordinates on Q satisfying the relations:\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u03bbi\n.\n\u2202\u03bbi\n\u2202\u03bbi\nWe denote by \u03bci the conjugate momentum to \u03bbi ; clearly, one has\nN \u2202\u03bc\u2202 i = \u03bbi \u2202\u03bc\u2202 i . The coordinates (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn , \u03bci , . . . , \u03bcn ) are DarbouxNijenhuis coordinates for the \u03c9N manifold (T \u2217 Q, P0 , P1 ).\nWe can exploit the geometric setting of \u03c9N manifolds in order to find\nan intrinsic separability condition for a given Hamiltonian function H \u2208\nC \u221e (T \u2217 Q). Let us suppose that the vector fields XH , NXH , . . . N n\u22121 XH\nare pointwise linearly independent, so that they generate an n-dimensional\ndistribution DH . If we compute the conditions\nL\n\n(2.6)\n\nd(N \u2217 dH)(N i XH , N j XH ) = 0\n\nfor all i, j = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1\n\nin the Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn , \u03bci , . . . , \u03bcn ), we get a\nsystem of differential equations equivalent to the Levi-Civita separability formulae [6, p. 208, eq. (1.230)].\nTheorem 2. In the above hypotheses and notations, the DarbouxNijenhuis coordinates associated with L are separation variables for H\nif and only if the 2-form d(N \u2217 dH) annihilates the distribution DH .\nThe separability condition (2.6) implies that the distribution DH is\nintegrable. So, there exist n independent local functions H1 , . . . Hn that\nare constant on the leaves of DH . The distribution being invariant under the action of N, the same is true for the differential ideal generated\n\n\fSEPARABILITY OF THE NR SYSTEM\n\n7\n\nby the Hi 's, so that the following condition holds:\n(2.7)\n\nN \u2217 dHi =\n\nn\nX\n\nFik dHk ,\n\nk=1\n\nwhere Fik is a matrix with distinct eigenvalues. Moreover, since DH is\nLagrangian with respect to both \u03c90 and \u03c91 , we have:\n(2.8)\n\n{Hi , Hj }0 = {Hi , Hj }1 = 0\n\nfor all i, j .\n\nIt follows that the functions H1 , . . . Hn are separable in the the DarbouxNijenhuis coordinates singled out by L.\nA particular case of this state of affairs is provided by the following\nexample, which will turn out to be of great importance in the study of\nthe NR system. Let us consider the characteristic polynomial\n(2.9)\n\ndet(\u03bbI \u2212 L) = \u03bbn \u2212 c1 \u03bbn\u22121 \u2212 c2 \u03bbn\u22122 \u2212 * * * \u2212 cn\n\nof the endomorphism L, and assume we are given a Hamiltonian H\nsatisfying the condition\n(2.10)\n\nd(N \u2217 dH) = dc1 \u2227 dH .\n\nFrom (2.5) it follows at once that this equation is equivalent to\n(2.11)\n\nd(LXH \u03b8L \u2212 Hdc1 ) = 0 .\n\nThe condition (2.10) is a sufficient condition to the separability of H in\nthe Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates associated to N, because it implies\nthat the 2-form d(N \u2217 dH) annihilates the distribution DH generated by\nthe vector fields XH , NXH , . . . N n\u22121 XH . Moreover, it can be shown\n[13] that, choosing a local function H2 such that dH2 = N \u2217 dH \u2212 c1 dH,\nthe 1-form N \u2217 dH2 \u2212 c2 dH is again closed, so that we can find a local\npotential H3 . By iterating this procedure, we end up with n independent local functions H1 = H, . . . , Hn that are constant on the leaves of\nDH and satisfy the conditions:\ndHi+1 = N \u2217 dHi \u2212 ci dH\n(2.12)\n\ni = 2, . . . , n \u2212 1\n\n\u2217\n\n0 = N dHn \u2212 cn dH .\n\nIn this case the matrix F has the form\n\uf8eb\nc1 1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c2 0 1\n\uf8ec. .\nF =\uf8ec\n\uf8ec .. .. 0\n\uf8ec. . .\n\uf8ed .. .. ..\ncn 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n... 0\n. . .. \uf8f7\n. .\uf8f7\n. . .. \uf8f7\n. .\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n..\n. 1\uf8f8\n... 0\n\n\f8\n\nC. BARTOCCI, G. FALQUI, AND M. PEDRONI\n\nand the following condition is readily checked:\nN \u2217 dF = F dF .\n\n(2.13)\n\nWe set F = S \u22121 diag(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) S. Then, one has Sjk = \u03bbjn\u2212k and,\nby\n[11, Theorem 4.2], one obtains the separability equations\nPnvirtue of\nn\u2212k\n= Uj . Summing up, the functions H1 = H, . . . Hn are\nk=1 Hk \u03bbj\nproved to be St\u00e4ckel separable in the Darboux-Nijenhuis coordinates\nassociated to L (this means that the separation relations are affine in\nthe Hk 's).\n3. Torsionless tensors and separability of the NR system\nAccording to the results of Section 2, to separate the NR system\nwe seek a tensor field L of type (1, 1) on S n satisfying the \"strong\"\nseparability condition (2.10), i.e.,\n(3.1)\n\nd(LXH \u03b8L \u2212 Hdc1 ) = 0 ,\nPn\n\nwhere \u03b8L = a,b=1 Lab pa dqb (for any set of fibered coordinates (qa , pa ))\nand c1 = trL. We have seen that the eigenvalues of such an L (if real\nand functionally independent) are separation variables for H. The form\nof the constraint and of the potential suggest using on S n the coordinates Xa := xa 2 , for a = 1, . . . , n.1 If Ya are the momenta conjugated\nto the Xa (and the point particle has unit mass), the NR Hamiltonian\nis given by H = T + V with\nX\nX\nT = 2\nXa (1 \u2212 Xa )Ya 2 \u2212 4\nXa Xb Y a Y b\na\n\nV\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n1X\n\n2\n\na\n\n(\u03b1a \u2212 \u03b1n+1 )Xa +\n\na<b\n\u0015\n\u03b2a 2\n\nXa\n\n+\n\n\u03b2n+1 2\nP\n.\n2(1 \u2212 a Xa )\n\nExpanding in powers of the momenta, we see that condition (3.1) splits\ninto\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nd(LXT \u03b8L \u2212 T dc1 ) = 0\nd(LXV \u03b8L \u2212 V dc1 ) = 0 .\n\nRemark 3. As noticed in [4], equation (3.2) means that L is a symmetric conformal Killing tensor with respect to the usual Riemannian\nmetric of S n , and implies that the torsion of L vanishes. On the other\nhand, equation (3.3) can be written as d(L\u2217 dV + c1 dV ) = 0, which\nis a separability condition on the potential V appearing in the works\nof Benenti (see, e.g., [2]). However, since our approach applies also to\n1In\n\nthis and in the following section we use the following convention: middle\nindices like i, j, k run from 1 to n + 1, while indices like a, b, c run from 1 to n.\n\n\fSEPARABILITY OF THE NR SYSTEM\n\n9\n\nsystems which are defined on general symplectic manifolds (not necessarily cotangent bundles), or, in other words, to Hamiltonians that\nare not quadratic in the momenta, we will not use these results and\nwe will solve directly equations (3.2) and (3.3). We also observe that a\nsignificant part of the \"Riemannian\" theory of separation of variables\ncan be seen as a particular case of the bi-Hamiltonian approach (see\n[13, 8] and [3], where the Neumann system is also discussed).\nWe start seeking aPsolution L whose dependence on the coordinates\nXa is affine: Lab = c Aabc Xc + Bba . Let us consider, for the sake of\nsimplicity, the case n = 2. Condition (3.2) gives\nA112 = A122 = A211 = A221 = B21 = B12 = 0 ,\nA121 = A222 ,\n\nA111 = A212 = A222 \u2212 B11 = B22 ,\n\nso that we are left with the unknowns A222 , B11 , and B22 . Now, condition\n(3.3) is equivalent to\nA222 (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ) = (B22 \u2212 B11 )(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 ) ,\nwhich means that A222 = c(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 ) and B22 \u2212 B11 = c(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ) for\nsome constant c. Thus B22 = c(\u03b12 + d) and B11 = c(\u03b11 + d), where d is\nanother constant, and the components of L are given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014 1\n\u0015\n(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )X1 + \u03b11 + d\n(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 )X1\nL1 L12\n=c\n.\nL21 L22\n(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )X2\n(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 )X2 + \u03b12 + d\nSince we are interested in the coordinates given by the eigenvalues of\nL, we can set c = 1 and d = 0 without loss of generality.\nComing back to the general case, it is not difficult to check that the\n1-form\n!\nX\nX\nX\n\u03b8L =\n\u03b1a Ya dXa +\nXb Y b\n(\u03b1n+1 \u2212 \u03b1a ) dXa ,\na\n\nb\n\na\n\ncorresponding to the (1, 1) tensor field given by\n(3.4)\n\nLab = (\u03b1n+1 \u2212 \u03b1b )Xa + \u03b4ba \u03b1a ,\n\nsatisfies conditions (3.2) and (3.3). Although these formulas define L in\ncoordinate patches, it is not difficult to show that L is globally defined\non the whole S n . Indeed, it is the restriction to S n of the tensor field\nL\u0302 on Rn+1 defined as\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nxi X\n(\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1i )xk 2 xj\nL\u0302\n= \u03b1i\n+ 4\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi r j,k\n\u2202xj\n\n\f10\n\nC. BARTOCCI, G. FALQUI, AND M. PEDRONI\n\nP\nwhere r 2 = i xi 2 . In order to show that L\u0302 restricts to S n it is sufficient\nto check that L\u0302\u2217 dr = 0, implying that, at every point of S n , the image\nof L\u0302 is (contained in) the tangent space to the sphere.\nSummarizing, we have found a tensor field L satisfying the separability condition (3.1); thanks to the result of [4] referred to in Remark\n3, the torsion of L vanishes. Thus the coordinates associated with L\nare separated variables for the NR system. Let us explicitly check that\nthe eigenvalues of L coincide with the spheroconical coordinates. To\nthis end we find convenient to introduce the following notations: let \u03b1\nand X denote the n\u2013component vectors whose entries are, respectively,\n\u03b1b = \u03b1n+1 \u2212 \u03b1b ,\n\nX b = Xb ,\n\nb = 1, . . . , n,\n\nand let A be the n \u00d7 n diagonal matrix of the parameters \u03b1a . Then\nwe can compactly write the matrix form (3.4) of the tensor field L as\n(3.5)\n\nL = A + X \u2297 \u03b1.\n\nTo compute the roots of det(\u03bb \u2212 L) we notice that the L is a rank 1\nperturbation of A; hence we write\n\u0001\n(3.6)\n\u03bb \u2212 L = \u03bb \u2212 A * (1 \u2212 X\u2032 (\u03bb) \u2297 \u03b1) ,\nwhere X\u2032 (\u03bb) is the vector with entries\n\nAronszajn\u2013Weinstein formula\n\nXb\n.\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1b\n\nUsing the rank 1\n\ndet(1 + x \u2297 y) = 1 + hy, xi,\nwe arrive at\n(3.7)\n\ndet(\u03bb \u2212 L) =\n\nn\nY\n\na=1\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1a ) 1 \u2212\n\nn\nX\n(\u03b1n+1 \u2212 \u03b1b )Xb \u0001\nb=1\n\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1b\n\n.\n\nRecalling\nthe definitions Xb = xb 2 , for b = 1, . . . , n, and the constraint\nP 2\ni xi = 1, we can by means of elementary calculations conclude that\nsuch an equation is equivalent to\nY\nX x2\ni\n,\n(3.8)\ndet(\u03bb \u2212 L) =\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1i )\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1i\ni\ni\n\nthat is, the eigenvalues \u03bba of L satisfy the equations\nX x2\nX\ni\n(3.9)\n=0,\nwith\nx2i = 1 .\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1i\ni\ni\n\nThese are the well-known defining relations for the spheroconical (or\nelliptic-spherical) coordinates.\n\n\fSEPARABILITY OF THE NR SYSTEM\n\n11\n\nWe close this section reporting, for the sake of completeness, the\nwell-known computation of the momenta \u03bca conjugated to the \u03bba .

Integrals of motion and St\u00e4ckel separability\nIn the previous section we have found a tensor field L on S n which\ngives the separation coordinates of the NR system (i.e., the spheroconical coordinates). Since L satisfies the \"strong\" separability condition\n(3.1), we know from Section 2 that:\n(1) There is an iterative method for constructing n integrals of motion in involution, (H = H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn ). (Of course, we have\nto take into account that T \u2217 S n is simply connected for n \u2265 2.)\n(2) The NR system is St\u00e4ckel-separable.\n\n\f12\n\nC. BARTOCCI, G. FALQUI, AND M.

This defines the Ha up to\nadditive constants. For example, in the case n = 2 one finds\n(4.1)\n\nH2 = 2(\u03b11 Y2 2 X2 + \u03b12 Y1 2 X1 )(X1 + X2 \u2212 1) \u2212 2\u03b13 X1 X2 (Y2 \u2212 Y1 )2\n\u0014\n1\n\u03b12 \u03b21 2 \u03b11 \u03b22 2\n\u2212\n\u03b12 (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b13 )X1 + \u03b11 (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 )X2 +\n+\n2\nX1\nX2\n\u0015\n2 X2\n2 X1\n2 \u03b12 X 1 + \u03b11 X 2\n+(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 )\u03b21\n+ (\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )\u03b22\n+ \u03b23\n.\nX1\nX2\n1 \u2212 X1 \u2212 X2\n\nBefore showing that the Ha coincide with the integrals of motion known\nin the literature, let us consider the separability \u00e0 la St\u00e4ckel of the NR\nsystem.

In particular, P1 = 21 H, where H is the NR Hamiltonian.\nOur strategy to prove that Pa = 21 Ha for all a is to show that\n(4.4)\n\nN \u2217 dP (\u03bbb) = \u03bbb dP (\u03bbb) ,\n\nb = 1, . . . , n ,\n\n\fSEPARABILITY OF THE NR SYSTEM\n\n13\n\nwhich implies that the Pa satisfy\nN \u2217 dPa = dPa+1 + ca dP1 ,\n\na = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 ,\n\nbecause the \u03bbb 's are the roots of (2.9).
