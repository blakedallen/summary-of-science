Introduction\nThe BFKL Pomeron calculus[1, 2] gives the simplest and the most transparent approach to the high energy\namplitude in QCD. This approach is based on the BFKL Pomeron [3] and the interactions between the\nBFKL Pomerons [4, 5, 6, 7], which are taken into account in the spirit of the Gribov Reggeon Calculus\n[8]. It can be written in the form of the functional integral (see Ref. [5]) and formulated in terms of the\ngenerating functional (see Refs. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]).\nIn Ref. [14] 1 (see also Ref. [15]) it is shown that the BFKL Pomeron calculus can be reduced to the\nfollowing functional integral\nZ\n+\n+\nZ[\u03a6, \u03a6 ] =\nD \u03a6(b, k; Y ) D \u03a6+ (b, k; Y ) eS[\u03a6,\u03a6 ]\n(1.1)\nwith\nS = S0 + SI =\n1\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+\n\nd b d k \u03a6 (b, k; Y )\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03a6 (b, k; Y )\n\u2212\n\u2202Y\n\n\u1fb1S\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012Z\n\nSee Eq.(3.18), Eq.(3.55) , Eq.(4.97) and Eq.(4.98) of Ref. [14] for more details.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nd2 k\u2032 K k, k\u2032 \u03a6 b, k\u2032 ; Y + (1.2)\n\n\f\u03a6+ (b, k; Y ) \u03a6(b, k; Y ) + \u03b12S\n\n\b\n\u0001\u0001\n\u03a6 (b, k; Y ) \u03a6+ (b, k; Y ) \u2212 \u03a6+ (b, k; Y ) \u03a6 (b, k; Y ) \u03a6 (b, k; Y )\n\nwhere K (k, k\u2032 ) is the BFKL kernel in the momentum representation, namely,\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nd k K k, k\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03a6 b, k ; Y\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03a6 (b, k \u2032 ; Y )\n\u2212 k2\nd k\n(k \u2212 k\u2032 )2\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nd2 k\u2032\n\n(k \u2212\n\n\u03a6 (b, k; Y )\n+ (k \u2212 k\u2032 )2 )\n\nk\u2032 )2 (k\u20322\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe theory determined by the functional integral of Eq. (1.1), can be written [14] in the equivalent\nform introducing the generating functional Z(Y, [u(b, k)]) defined as [9]\nZ (Y \u2212 Y0 ; [u(bi , ki )]) \u2261\n\u2261\n\nXZ\nn=1\n\nPn (Y \u2212 Y0 ; b1 , k1 ; . . . ; bi , ki ; . . . ; bn , kn )\n\n(1.4)\nn\nY\n\nu(bi , ki ) d2 xi d2 ki\n\ni=1\n\nwhere u(bi , ki ) are arbitrary functions and Pn (Y \u2212 Y0 ; b1 , k1 ; . . . ; bi , ki ; . . . ; bn , kn ) is the probability to find\nn-dipoles with transverse momenta ki .\nFor this functional we have the following evolution equation [14]\n\u2202 Z (Y \u2212 Y0 ; [ u(b, k) ])\n= \u03c7 [ u(b, k) ] Z (Y \u2212 Y0 ; [ u(b, k) ])\n\u2202Y\n\n(1.5)\n\nwith\n\u0012\n\n\u0012 Z\n\u2212\nd2 k\u2032 K(k, k\u2032 )u(b, k \u2032 )\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n+ u(b, k) u(b, k)\n\u03c7[u] =\nd bd k\n\u2032\n\u03b4u(b, k )\n\u03b4u(b, k)\n\u0013\n2\n1\n\u03b4\n\u2212\u03b12S (u(b, k) u(b, k) \u2212 u(b, k))\n;\n2 \u03b4u(b, k) \u03b4u(b, k)\nZ\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u1fb1S\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n(1.6)\n(1.7)\n\nIn this paper our goal is to solve Eq. (1.5) deeply in the saturation region or, in other words, for the\ndipoles which sizes are much larger than the typical saturation size 1/Qs (x). In the next section we set\nthe problem and will discuss the main assumptions that simplify the problem. In section 3 we discuss the\nmean field approximation. In this approximation the expression for \u03c7[u] is simple and it is determined by\nEq. (1.6). Solution in this approximation is known (see Ref. [17]) but we will solve this equation using a\ndifferent method. Therefore, we view this section as a training ground for our method of finding a solution.\nIn section 4 we focus our efforts on searching a solution to the general equation (see Eq. (1.5)). We\nconsider the solution which shows the geometrical scaling behaviour in the saturation domain and which\nmatches with the linear evolution equation at r \u2248 1/Qs (x) where r is the dipole size and Qs (x) is the new\nscale: saturation momentum.\nIn conclusions we summarize the main results of the paper and compare them with other attempts to\nsolve this equation .\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f2. Problem setting and the main assumptions.\nThe problem that we would like to solve, is the scattering of very small colourless dipole , which size is\nr, with the large target (let say with a nucleus with radius R, R \u226b r). We are interested in finding the\nasymptotic behaviour of this amplitude deeply in the saturation region where \u03b1S ln(r 2 Q2s ) \u226b 1.\nGenerally speaking , we need to fix initial and boundary conditions to solve Eq. (1.5). These conditions\nare well known and they have the form\n\nInitial conditions:\n\nat Y = 0\n\nZ (Y = 0; [u(b, k)]) = u(b, k) ;\n\nBoundary conditions: at ui = 1\n\nZ (Y ; [u(b, k) = 1])\n\n=\n\n1;\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nEq. (2.1) means that at low energy the interaction can be reduced to the single BFKL Pomeron exchange\nwhile Eq. (2.2) follows directly from the meaning of Pn as probability to find n-dipoles and reflects the\nP\nnormalization for the probability ( Pn = 1).\nIn terms of anomalous dimension \u03b3 we replace the general BFKL kernel (see solid line in Fig. 1\nZ\n\u20322\n2\nK(k, k\u2032 ) e(\u03b3\u22121) ln(k /k ) = \u03c7 (\u03b3) = 2 \u03c8(1) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03c8(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n(2.3)\n\nby\n\u03c7(\u03b3) =\n\n(\n\n1\n\u03b3\n\nfor r 2 Q2s \u226a 1 ;\nfor r 2 Q2s \u226b 1 ;\n\n1\n1\u2212\u03b3\n\n(2.4)\n\n(see dotted-dashed line in Fig. 1)\nThis approach is quite different from the diffusion approximation for \u03c7 (\u03b3) (see dotted in Fig. 1\n1\n\u03c7 (\u03b3) = 2 ln 2 + 28 \u03b6(3) (\u03b3 \u2212 )2\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhich was used in Refs. [15, 22, 23, 24] to reduce the general equation to so called Fisher-KolmogorovPertrovsky-Piscounov equation[25] (F-KPP equation). \u03b6(x) in Eq. (2.5) is the Riman zeta function.\n\u0001n\nThe kernel of Eq. (2.4) sums the contributions of the order of \u03b1S ln(r 2 \u039b2 ) for r 2 Q2s \u226a 1 where\n\u0001n\n\u03b1S ln(r 2 \u039b2 ) \u226b 1; and it leads to summation of the terms of the order of \u03b1S ln(r 2 Q2s ) in the kinematic\nregion where r 2 Q2s \u226b 1 and as ln(r 2 Q2s ) \u226b 1 [16, 17].\nIt means that this kernel can describe the behaviour of our systen deeply in the saturation region\n\u226b 1) or/and in the perturbative QCD region at r 2 Q2s \u226a 1 while we cannot expect that our\napproximation will be able to reproduce the exact solution in the vicinity of the saturation scale r 2 Q2s \u2248\n1). These features of this kernel one can see from Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows that the approximate kernel of\nEq. (2.4) can describe the exact BFKL kernel only at \u03b3 close to 0 and 1 while it leads to a contribution\nwhich considerably differs from the exact kernel at \u03b3 = 1/2. For \u03b3 close to 1/2 we can use the diffusion\napproximation of Eq. (2.5) which fails to reproduce the correct behaviour inside the saturation region. One\n\n(r 2 Q2s\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fcan see this since we cannot obtain the correct asymptotic behaviour [17] in the mean field approximation\nwith the kernel of Eq. (2.5). On the other hand, the kernel of Eq. (2.4) cannot describe the behaviour\nof the scattering amplitude in the region close to the saturation scale. In particular, Eq. (2.4) gives the\nsaturation scale as\nln(Q2s R2 ) = 4\u1fb1S Y = 4\u1fb1S ln(1/x)\n(2.6)\nwhere \u1fb1S = (Nc /\u03c0) \u03b1S , while the correct saturation scale is equal [1, 18, 19]\nln(Q2s R2 ) =\n\n\u03c7 (\u03b3cr )\n1 \u2212 \u03b3cr\n\nwith \u03b3cr determined by equation:\n\n\u03c7 (\u03b3cr )\nd\u03c7 (\u03b3cr )\n= \u2212\n1 \u2212 \u03b3cr\nd \u03b3cr\n\n(2.7)\n\nEq. (2.7) gives \u03b3cr = 1/2 that reduces Eq. (2.7) to Eq.

[5] to the simple form of Eq. (1.2).\nNamely, we assume that at high energy we can use the\nBFKL Pomeron at \u03b3 close to 1/2 which leads to\nL12 \u2261 x412 \u22072x1 \u22072x2\n\n12\n10\n\n\u0001\n\nG x1 , x2 ; Y |x\u20321 , x\u20322 ; Y \u2032\n\n= G x1 , x2 ; Y |x\u20321 , x\u20322 ; Y \u2032\n\n8\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n=\n(2.8)\n\nwhere G (x1 , x2 ; Y |x\u20321 , x\u20322 ; Y \u2032 ) is the Pomeron Green's\nfunction.\n\n6\n4\n2\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b3cr\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b3\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n1 \u2212\u03b3cr\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nFigure 1: The kernel of the BFKL equation: the\nsolid line shows the exact expression of Eq. (2.3); the\nkernel of Eq. (2.4) is plotted in dotted-dashed line;\nand the diffusion approximation of Eq. (2.5) for the\nBFKL kernel, that leads to F-KPP equation, is presented by dotted line. \u03b3cr is calculated using Eq. (2.7).\n\nThis assumption works quite well both for diffusion\napproximation for the BFKL kernel (see Eq. (2.5)) and\nfor the kernel of Eq. (2.4) since \u03b3cr for this kernel is\nequal to 1/2 (\u03b3cr = 1/2).\nIt should be mentioned that Eq. (1.2) is written\nassuming that\nb \u2261\n\nx1 + x2\n\u226b x1 \u2212 x2 ;\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\nIndeed, this assumption looks natural for the mean field approximation,since we expect that the typical\nsize of the dipoles will be of the order of 1/Qs (x) (Qs (x) is the saturation scale) while the typical impact\nparameter of the scattering dipole should be much larger (at least of the order of the size of a target (R)\n). However, in the Pomeron loop we have integration over b and we should study the b dependence more\ncarefully. Generally speaking, the integration over impact parameter in the Pomeron loop leads to the value\nof b of the order the typical size of the dipoles in the loop and can change considerable the conclusions of\nthe approaches where the b dependence has not been taken into account (see [20, 22, 23, 24]).\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fFor our kernel, that sums log contributions, the impact parameter dependence does not influence\non such summation since the BFKL Pomeron shows the rapid fall down as a function b (\u221d 1/b4 ) and\nintegration over b does not generate any logarithmic contribution. The b dependence for our kernel has\nbeen discussed in details in Refs. [1, 17] and we will show how it works in the next section.\nIt should be mention that the relation between fields in momentum and coordinate representation\nlooks as follows\nZ\n~\n2\n\u03a6(x1 , x2 ; Y ) = x12\nd2 k ei k*~x12 \u03a6 (k, b; Y )\n(2.10)\nwhere x12 = x1 \u2212 x2 .\nWe would like to solve directly Eq. (1.5). Our main assumption is that Z (b, k; Y ) actually is a function\nof one variable Z (\u03be; Y, [u]) 2 :\n\u0001\n\u03be = ln Q2s (x)/k2\n(2.11)\nIn finding the solution we replace the generating functional of Eq. (1.4) by the generating function\nZ (\u03be, u) =\n\nX\n\nPn (\u03be) un\n\n(2.12)\n\nn=1\n\nWe can use Eq. (2.12) instead of the generating functional of Eq. (1.4) since the scattering amplitude\nis determined by the following equation [20, 11]\nN (Y ; k; [\u03b3i ])\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03be \u226b1\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u2212\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nn\n\u221e\nY\nX\ndn\n(\u22121)n\nd2 ki n Z (Y \u2212 Y0 ; {ki }, u) |u=1 \u2192\n\u03b3n ({ki }; b; Y0 ; R)\nn!\nd u\n\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\ni=1\n\n(\u22121)n\nn!\n\n\u0001\n\u03b3n ({ki = 1/R}; b; Y0 ; R) Z Y \u2212 Y0 ; {ki = 1/R2 }, u |u=1 =\n\n(\u22121)n\n\u03b3n ({ki = 1/R}; b; Y0 ; R) Z (\u03be; u) |u=1\nn!\n\n(2.13)\n\n\u03b3n ({ki }; b; Y0 ; R) in Eq. (2.13) is the scattering amplitude of n dipoles with momenta ki with the target of the\nsize R at low energy. In logarithmic approximation we can consider this amplitude as \u03b3n ({ki }; b; Y0 ; R) =\nQ\n\u03b3n ({ki = 1/R}; b; Y0 ; R) ni \u03b4(2) (ki \u2212 1/R). Therefore we need to know only generating function of\nEq. (2.12) to find the scattering amplitude.\nIn the perturbative QCD region (r 2 Q2s (x) \u2248 Q2s /k\u20322 \u226a 1) the scattering amplitude has the following\nform for the kernel of Eq. (2.4)\n\u0011\n\u0010 p\n\u0001\n(2.14)\nN Y = ln(1/x); ln(k\u20322 R2 ) = \u03b12S exp 2 \u1fb1S Y ln(k\u20322 R2 ) \u2212 ln(k\u20322 R2 )\n\nwhich can be translated in the initial condition, namely,\n2\n\nFor simplicity we neglect the dependence of Z on impact parameters. For large nuclei this is a good approximation.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f\u0010 p\n\u0011\n\u0001\nZ Y ; ln(k\u20322 R2 ); u = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 u) exp 2 \u1fb1S Y ln(k\u20322 R2 ) \u2212 ln(k\u20322 R2 )\n\n(2.15)\n\nIn Ref. [26] it is proved that the solution of the linear evolution equation in the vicinity of k 2 \u2192 Q2s shows\nthe geometrical scaling behaviour and in terms of the generating function this contribution looks as\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n\u03be\n(2.16)\nZ (\u03be; u) |\u03be<0, |\u03be|<1 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 u) exp\n2\nfor the solution of Eq. (2.15). In Ref. [26] it is shown that the dependence of the perturbative solution on\nthe only one variable \u03be is a general property also for the exact kernel of the BFKL equation. Eq. (2.16)\nwill be used as the initial condition in our solution.\nTo check the strategy of our approach, especially Eq. (2.12) , we first consider the BFKL Pomeron\ninteraction in the kinematic region near to the saturation scale where we expect the geometrical scaling\nsolution of Eq. (2.16). We will show that in leading log approximation of perturbative QCD which corresponds to the kernel of Eq. (2.4), we can avoid the assumptions given by Eq. (2.8) and Eq. (2.9), while\nEq. (2.12) will be proved.\n\n3. The BFKL Calculus in the geometrical scaling region\nWe start with the simplest enhanced diagram of Fig. 2-a. We will write the expression for this diagram for\nfunction \u03c6 which is defined as\nZ\n~\n\u03c6(\u03be; \u03c1, q) =\nd2 b ei ~q*b N (\u03be, \u03c1; b)\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03be is defined by Eq. (2.11) and \u03c1 = ln(k2 R2 ). The diagram can be written as follows\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03c6 (Fig. 2-a|\u03be, \u03c1; q) =\nd \u03be \u2032 d \u03c1\u2032 d2 q \u2032 d \u03be\"d \u03c1\" \u03c6 \u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 , \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 , q\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nG3P , \u03c6 \u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be\", \u03c1\u2032 \u2212 \u03c1\", ~\nq \u2212 ~q\u2032 \u03c6 \u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be\", \u03c1\u2032 \u2212 \u03c1\", ~q\u2032 G3P \u03c6 (\u03be\" \u2212 \u03be0 , \u03c1\" \u2212 \u03c10 , q)\n\nIn Eq. (3.2) we introduced the variables \u03be instead of rapidity y and \u03c1 instead of k2 .\n\nThe integration over q \u2032 in Eq. (3.2) has been discussed in details in Refs. [1, 27]. The result of this\ndiscussion is the fact that the integration over q \u2032 sits at q \u2032 = the lowest virtuality in the loop. In other\nR\nwords, d2 q \u2032 = \u03c0 k\"2 in Fig. 2-a if we calculate this diagram in the region of \u03be < 0. Taking this into\naccount we reduce Eq.

In particular,\nit leads to the linear equation for the functional N = 1 \u2212 Z (\u03be, u = 1 \u2212 \u03b3) if we neglect the terms of the\norder N 2 .

We also used the kinematic restriction \u03c1 < \u03be that follows from Fig. 2-b.\nEq.

We will discuss below the main propertiers of\nthe solution to Eq. (3.12) but first we start from the solution to our problem in mean field approximation\nto check the main assumption that we make on the way of obtaining Eq. (3.12).\n\n4. Exact solution and the mean field approximation (MFA)\nIn the mean field approximation \u03c7[u] is determined only by Eq. (1.6) . This fact considerably simplifies the\nequation since such an equation belongs to the well known class of the Louisville equations. The Louisville\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fequation has a general solution, namely, Z (Y \u2212 F (u)). Using this form for the general solution as well as\ntwo conditions (initial and boundary, see Eq. (2.1) and Eq. (2.2)): we can easily prove that for Z we have\nthe non-linear equation [9, 10], namely\n\u1fb1S\n\u2202 Z (Y \u2212 Y0 ; b, k )\n=\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n\u2212 K(k, k ) Z Y \u2212 Y0 ; b, k + Z (Y \u2212 Y0 ; b, k )\n\n(4.1)\n\nThis equation leads to Balitsky-Kovchegov equation[20, 21] for the scattering amplitude and it has been\nsolved in Ref. [17] and the solution turns out to be the function of the only one variable \u03be (see Eq. (2.11)).\nIn Ref. [17] it is shown that at large \u03be the generating functional Z (Y \u2212 Y0 ; b, k\u2032 ) for the kernel of Eq. (2.4)\nbehaves as\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0001\n\u03be\n\u2032\nZ Y \u2212 Y0 ; b, k\n= C exp \u2212\n(4.2)\n8\n\nIn the log approximation for the BFKL kernel in the saturation region which is related to the kernel of\nEq.

(4.5) satisfies the initial condition of Eq. (2.16) if we define Y = \u03be 2 /8 \u2212 \u03be/2.\nFor \u03be \u2192 0 the scattering amplitude is equal to\nN (Y, \u03b3 = 1 \u2212 u) =\n\n\u03b3 exp (Y)\n1 + \u03b3 (exp (Y) \u2212 1)\n\n(4.6)\n\nSince \u03b3 is of the order of \u03b1S we obtain Eq. (2.14) at small \u03be with our definition of Y. Of course, we cannot\nguarantee term 21 \u03be since we assumed that \u03be \u226b 1, therefore, we add this term to guarantee the matching\nwith the initial conditions at \u03be \u2192 0.\nTherefore, we showed that our procedure involving Eq. (2.12) and Eq. (2.16) leads to the correct\nbehaviour of the amplitude in the mean field approximation. Therefore, we confirm our main assumption\nthat for searching for behaviour at large values of \u03be, we can consider of generating function of Eq.

[13] which explores the large value of \u03ba.\nFirst we find the asymptotic solution to the master equation from the following equation:\n0 = \u2212 u ( \u2212 u)\n\n1\n\u2202 2 Z (\u03be; u)\n\u2202Z (\u03be; u)\n+\nu (1 \u2212 u)\n\u2202u\n\u03ba\n\u2202u2\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe solution that satisfies the boundary condition of Eq. (2.2) is equal to\nZasymp (Y = \u221e, u) =\n\n1 \u2212 e\u03ba u\n1 \u2212 e\u03ba\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe second step is to search the solution in the form\nZ (\u03be; u) = Zasymp (Y = \u221e, u) \u2206Z (\u03be; u)\n\n(5.4)\n\nassuming that \u2202 2 \u2206Z (Y; u) /\u2202u2 \u226a \u03ba (, \u2202Zasymp (Y = \u221e, u) /\u2202u ) (\u2202\u2206Z (Y; u) /\u2202u). Since \u03ba \u226b 1 this\nassumption looks reasonable. For \u2206Z (\u03be; u) we obtain the equation\n\u2202Zasymp (Y = \u221e, u) \u2202\u2206Z (Yu)\n\u2202\u2206Z (Yu)\n\u2202\u2206Z (Yu)\n= \u2212 u (1 \u2212 u)\n+ 2 u(1 \u2212 u)\n\u2202Y\n\u2202u\n\u2202u\n\u2202u\n\n(5.5)\n\nAssuming that \u03ba \u226b 1 Eq. (5.5) reduces to the form\n\u2202\u2206Z (Y; u)\n\u2202 \u2206Z (Y; u)\n= u (1 \u2212 u)\n\u2202Y\n\u2202u\n\n(5.6)\n\nEq. (5.6) has the solution\n\u2206Z (Y; u) = \u03a6\n\n\u0012\n\nu\nY + ln(\n1\u2212u\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.7)\n\nwith function \u03a6 that should be found from the initial conditions of Eq. (2.1).\nThe solution is\nZasymp (Y = \u221e; u) \u2206Z (Y; u) = \u0169\n\nu\n1 \u2212 e\u03ba u\nwith \u0169 =\n\u03ba\n\u0169\n1\u2212e\nu + (1 \u2212 u) exp (\u2212Y)\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(5.8)\n\n\fHowever we cannot use directly Eq. (5.8) to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the scattering amplitude\nat high Y since we need to find the typical values of u for such an amplitude at large values of \u03be or to\nfind the solution in the entire kinematic region. The latter we cannot do since our equation is valid only\nat \u03be \u226b 1. To solve this problem at \u03be \u226b 1 we need to use the t=channel unitarity constraints ( see Refs.\n[33, 34, 13]). we need to use the t-channel unitarity constraint ( see Refs. [33, 34, 13]), which has the\nfollowing form\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)n \u03b4n Z (\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 ; u)\n\u03b4n Z (\u03be \u2032 ; v)\nM P SI\nN\n(\u03be) =\n|\n|v=1 \u03b3 BA\n(5.9)\nu=1\nn\nn\nn!\n\u03b4u\n\u03b4v\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03b3 BA is the amplitude in the Born approximation for the interaction of two dipoles at low energy,\n\u0001\nn\nd\u0169 n\nZ and\nwhich is equal to \u03b12S = 1/\u03ba in our case. Using \u03ba \u226b 1 we see that in this limit dduZn = \u03ba du\nd\u0169\ndu = exp (\u2212Y) at u = 1.\nUsing these observation we obtain that\nN M P SI (\u03be)\n\n\u03be \u226b1\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u03be \u226b 1,\u03be \u2032 =1/2\u03be\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0012\n(\u03be\u2212\u03be\u2032 )2\n\u03be\u20322\n1 \u2212 e\u2212 8\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212 \u03b12S \u03ba2 1 \u2212 e\u2212 8\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1S \u03ba \u2212 2\u03ba e\u2212\u03be\n\n2 /32\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe choice \u03be \u2032 = \u03be/2 is clear since it gives the slowest approach to N = 1. Eq. (5.10) can only be considered\nas a approximation to the exact solution of Ref.[29] . It should be stressed that Eq. (5.10) leads to quite\na diffrent result in comparison with the Mueller-Patel-Salam-Iancu approach [33]. However, the MPSI\napproach has an advantage to be correct also for \u03be \u2248 1. This is the reason why we consider our problem\nin this approach in the next section.\n5.2 The Mueller-Patel-Salam-Iancu (MPSI) approach\nThis approximation has a legitimate region of applicability [33, 34]; can be used for small values of \u03be and\nit describes quite well in the entire kinematic region the exact solution to the BFKL Pomeron calculus in\nzero transverse dimension [35].\nIn this approach the scattering amplitude can be calculated using the following formula [33, 34]\n\u0001\nN M P SI x, y; x\u2032 , y \u2032 ; Y =\n(5.11)\nZ\nn\n\u221e\nY\nX\n\u03b4n Z M F A (Y \u2212 Y \u2032 ; [ui ])\n\u03b4n Z M F A (Y \u2032 ; [vi ])\nd xi d yi d x\u2032i d yi\n(\u22121)n n!\n|ui =1\n|vi =1 \u03b3 BA (xi , yi ; x\u2032i , yi\u2032 )\nn\nn\n\u03b4u\n\u03b4v\ni\ni\nn=1\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b3 BA (xi , yi ; x\u2032i , yi\u2032 ) is the amplitude of interaction of two dipoles in the Born approximation of perturbative QCD.\nIn the case of the geometrical scaling solution the MPSI approximation formula has an elegant form\n[36], namely\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0001 MF A \u2032 \u0001\nd d\nMF A\n\u2032\nM P SI\nN\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be ;u N\n\u03be ,v\n|u=1;v=1\n(5.12)\nN\n(\u03be) = 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\u03b3\ndu dv\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fwhere the generating function N M F A (\u03be, u) is defined as\nN M F A (\u03be, u) = 1 \u2212 Z M F A (\u03be, u)\n\n(5.13)\n\nThe generating functional in MFA for the kernel of Eq. (2.4) has been found in Ref. [17]. In this paper\nit is shown that the solution to Eq. (4.1) has the form that in our notations looks as follows\nN (\u03be, \u03b3 \u2261 1 \u2212 u) = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03b6(\u03be, u))\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere function \u03b6(\u03be, u) can be calculated from the implicit equation\n\u221a Z \u03b6\nd \u03b6\u2032\np\n\u03be = 2\n\u03b6 \u2032 + (exp(\u2212\u03b6 \u2032 ) \u2212 1)\n\u03b3\nFor small values of \u03b6 \u2192 \u03b3 Eq. (5.15) gives\n\n\u03be\n1\n\u03be \u226a1\nln (\u03b6(\u03be, u)/\u03b3) =\n\u03be which leads to \u03b6(\u03be, u) = \u03b3e 2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b3\n2\n\n(5.15)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03be\n1+\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.16)\n\nIt is easy to see that Eq. (5.14) with \u03b6(\u03be, u), determined by Eq. (5.16), satisfies the initial conditions of\nEq. (2.16), namely,\n1\nd ln N (\u03be, \u03b3)\n|\u03be=0 =\n(5.17)\nN (\u03be = 0, \u03b3) = \u03b3\nand\nd\u03be\n2\nFor large \u03b6 Eq. (5.15) leads to\n\u03be2\n(5.18)\n\u03b6(\u03be, u) =\n8\nwhich does not depend on u. Using this limiting behaviour we can suggest the following extrapolation\nformula\n\u221a !\n\u221a Z \u03b6\n2\n1\n\u2212 \u2032\n+ 2 ln(\u03b6/\u03b3)\n(5.19)\n2\nd \u03b6\u2032 p\n\u03be =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 + (exp(\u2212\u03b6 ) \u2212 1)\n\u03b3\np\n= 2 2 \u03b6 + 2 ln(\u03b6/\u03b3)\n(5.20)\n\nIn the first integral in Eq. (5.19) the small values of \u03b6 \u2032 does not contribute and we can replace it by the\nasymptotic al behaviour at large \u03b6 \u2032 .\nUsing Eq. (5.16),Eq. (5.18) and Eq. (5.20) we can suggest an approximation for the solution of\nEq. (5.15), namely.\n\u03b6 (\u03be; \u03b3) = \u03b3(1 + \u03be/2) + \u03be 2 /8\n(5.21)\nSubstituting Eq. (5.21) into Eq. (5.12) and choosing \u03be \u2032 = \u03be/2 that correspond to the smallest corrections\n(see [33] ) , we obtain the final result\n\u0001\nN M P SI (\u03be) = 1 \u2212 exp \u2212 \u03be 2 /16 \u2212 \u03b3 (1 + \u03be/2)\n(5.22)\n\nTherefore, the MPSI approximation leads to the geometrical scaling which satisfies the initial conditions\nat \u03be = 0. The \u03be 2 term does not depend of the scattering amplitude \u03b3 \u221d \u03b12S while the next terms show such\ndependence. Comparing with the solution of Eq. (5.10) one can see that both have the same \u03be 2 dependence\nbut the coefficients in front of of this term is quite different. We need to recall that the MPSI approach\ncannot be correct at very high energies [33].\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f6. Conclusions\nThe main result of this paper is the reduction of the complicated problem of summing all Pomern loops to\na Pomeron calculus in the zero transverse dimension but for 'time' Y given by Y = \u03be 2 /8 at \u03be \u226b 1. The\nprinciple features of this solution is the fact that the scattering amplitude depends on the only one variable:\nQ2s (x) r 2 where Qs (x) is the saturation scale while r is the size of the scattering dipole. Such geometrical\nscaling behaviour has been proven for the mean field approximation and has been seen experimentally\n[31]. However, this scaling behaviour was not expected for the theory given by the functional integral\nof Eq. (1.1). Indeed, at first sight, such theory can be rewritten as the Langevin equation for directed\npercolation [32], namely,\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2 \u03c0 \u1fb12S\n\u1fb1S\n\u2202 \u03a6 (b, k; Y )\n=\n* \u03a6(b, k; Y ) \u03a6(b, k; Y ) + \u03b6(b, k; Y ) (6.1)\nd2 k\u2032 K k, k\u2032 \u03a6 b, k \u2032 ; Y \u2212\n\u2202Y\n2\u03c0\nNc\nwith\n\n< |\u03b6(b, k; Y )| > = 0 ;\n\n< |\u03b6(b, k; Y ) \u03b6(b\u2032 , k\u2032 ; Y \u2032 )| > =\n\n(6.2)\n\n\u0001\n4 \u03c0 \u1fb12S\n* \u03a6(b, k; Y ) (1 \u2212 \u03a6(b, k; Y )) \u03b4(2) (~b \u2212 ~b\u2032 ) k2 \u03b4(2) (~k \u2212 ~k\u2032 ) \u03b4 Y \u2212 Y \u2032\nNc\n\nAs it has been shown in Refs. [22, 23, 24] we rather expect from the statistical physics analogy a\nsolution of the following type\n\u0001 !\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2 R2 ) \u2212 < ln(Q2 R2 ) > 2\n\u0001\nln(Q\n1\ns\ns\n(6.3)\nN \u03be\u0303; Y = \u221a\nd ln(Q2s R2 ) N ln(Q2s /k2 ) exp \u2212\n2 \u03c3 2 (Y )\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(Y )\n\u0001\nwhere N ln(Q2s /k2 ) is the scaling solution in the mean field approximation; < ln Q2s > is the average\nsaturation scale which differs from Qs given by Eq. (2.6) or Eq. (2.7), namely,[22]\n< ln(Q2s R2 ) > = ln(Q2s R2 ) \u2212\n\n\u03c0 2 \u1fb1S \u03b3cr \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03b3cr )\nY\n2 ln2 (1/\u03b12S )\n\n(6.4)\n\nand variance of the saturation momentum \u03c3 is proportional to\n\u03c3 2 = < ln2 (Q2s R2 ) > \u2212 (< ln(Q2s R2 ) >)2 \u221d\n\n\u1fb1S\nY\nln (1/\u03b12S )\n3\n\n(6.5)\n\nThe Pomeron loops change drastically the geometrical scaling behaviour of the MFA solution in an\nobvious contradiction with our solution. Indeed, Eq. (6.3) means that the amplitude is a function of one\nvariable\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\n2\n2\n2\nln(k R ) \u2212 < ln(Qs (Y ) R ) > \uf8f8\nq\n(6.6)\nN (\u03c4 ) = N \uf8ed\n\u1fb1S Y / ln3 (1/\u03b12S )\nDespites that Eq. (6.6) looks very plausible we should not forget that it is correct for the functional\nintegral of Eq. (1.2) which does not treat the impact parameter behaviour in consistent way. As has been\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fdemonstrated in section 3 Eq. (2.9), which is needed for a proof of Eq. (1.2), cannot be valid in the Pomeron\nloops.\nThe reason for such difference between our approach and Eq. (6.6) is clear from the consideration in\nsection 3: we found that not all Pomeron loops lead to a violation of the geometrical scaling behaviour.\nSome of them contribute to a change of the scaling solution in the MFA.\nIn our approach we have the following equation for the directed percolation instead of Eq. (6.1)\n4\nwith\n\n\u0001\n2 \u03c0 \u1fb12S\n\u2202 \u03a6 (\u03be)\n= \u03be\u03a6 \u03be \u2032 \u2212\n* \u03be \u03a6(\u03be) \u03a6(\u03be) + \u03b6(\u03be)\n\u2202\u03be\nNc\n< |int \u03b6(\u03be)| > = 0 ;\n< |\u03b6(\u03be) \u03b6(\u03be \u2032 )| > =\n\n(6.7)\n\n(6.8)\n\n4 \u03c0 \u1fb12S\n* \u03be \u03a6(\u03be) (1 \u2212 \u03a6(\u03be)) \u03b4(\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 )\nNc\n\nThese equations are equivalent to one dimensional Pomeron theory. The first and, perhaps, the only\nthat this theory does, it leads to replacement of the MFA solution in Eq. (6.3) by the solution that has\nbeen discussed here. Eq. (6.8) suggests that the correlation term in Eq. (6.2) has a more complicated\nstructure. We propose to sum Eq. (6.8) and Eq. (6.2) but , at the moment, we do not understand the\ncorrect b dependence in Eq. (6.2).\nWe would like to stress that we suggest a solution only for \u03be \u226b 1 and matching with the initial\nconditions was done in an approximate approach (the MPSI approach). Therefore, in principle, could be\nthat the solution we advocate here, just a wrong one but we believe that the MPSI approximation works\nwell enough to be an argument against such a possibility.\nOn the other hand, Eq. (6.3) is proven only in the vicinity of the saturation scale where, indeed,\n\u0001\nN ln(Q2s /k2 ) is the solution for MFA which is averaged with a Gaussian weight. However, it is difficult to\nunderstand how Eq. (6.6) can be matched with the perturbative QCD solution of Eq. (2.15) or Eq. (2.16)\noutside the saturation kinematic region. Indeed, \u2202 ln N/\u2202 ln(k2 R2 ) = (1/\u03c3(Y )) d ln N/d\u03c4 \u226a 1 instead of\n\u2202 ln N/\u2202 ln(k2 R2 ) \u2248 1.\nAt first sight the numerical calculation in Refs. [15, 22, 23, 24, 37] can give us an information on how\nthe solution behaves deeply inside of the saturation region. However, it is not the case at the moment\n, since: (i) all calculations have been performed for the diffusion kernel of Eq. (2.5) (in other words, for\nthe F-KPP equation) that cannot pretend to describe approaching to the asymptotic behaviour; (ii) the\nhope that such calculation can be generalized to the exact BFKL kernel is based on some conditions (see\nRev. [37]) which are plausible only in vicinity of the saturation scale; (iii) it has not been checked that\nthe numerical solution reproduces the solution of Eq. (2.15) or Eq. (2.16) , rather from fig. 16 of Rev.[37]\none can conclude that they do not approach them; and (iv) the accuracy of the numerical calculations\nhas not been checked by a comparison with the exactly solved model of the BFKL Pomeron calculus in\nzero transverse dimension. For the BFKL Pomeron calculus in zero transverse dimension the numerical\ncalculation should coinside with the exact solution given in Ref. [29] with Eq. (6.2) and should lead to\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fdecreasing amplitude at high energy (see Ref.[38] and references therein) for Eq. (6.2) without \u03a62 (b, k; Y )\nterm.\nIt should be stressed that the experimental data do not show any deviation from the geomerical scaling\nbehaviour while the estimates with \u03b1S \u2248 0.25 show that we expect a considerable violation of this scaling\nbehaviour accordingly to Eq. (6.3).\nSummarising we do not think that there is any proof that our solution is inconsistent but , of course,\nwe need to remember that this solution cannot be justified in the vicinity of the saturation scale. The only\nthat we showed is that our solution does not contradict the exact solution in the perturbative QCD region\n(see Eq. (2.15) or Eq. (2.16)). Such strategy was successful in the case of the mean field approximation\n[17]. On the other hand, solution of Eq. (6.3) is able to describe the system in the vicinity of the saturation\nscale but it is not hundred percents clear how this solution could be matched with Eq. (2.15) or Eq. (2.16).\nWe would like to stress again that the most probable way out is that we need to replace the MFA solution\nby ours in Eq. (6.3).\nWe are working to include the exact BFKL kernel in our consideration and to understand better the\nkinematic region of matching with the perturbative QCD solution. This is a very important issue since the\nmodel kernel of Eq. (2.4) does not give a correct high energy solution in the MFA (see Ref. [28]). If we will\nuse the correct solution in the MPSI approximation we will obtain the solution which being substituted in\nEq. (6.3) leads to a geometrical scaling behaviour after integration over ln(Q2s R2 ) . The only change is to\nreplace Q2s in the definition of variable \u03be (see Eq. (2.11)) by the new saturation momentum of Eq. (6.4).\nWe hope that the paper will be useful in searching a solution in the saturation region beyond the\nscope of statistical physics analogy for the BFKL Pomeron calculus including the Pomeron loops.\n\nAcknowledgments:\nWe are very grateful to Asher Gotsman, Edmond Iancu, Michael Kozlov, Uri Maor, Jeremy Miller and\nAl Mueller for hot and useful discussions on the subject.
