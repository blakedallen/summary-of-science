One\nsuch example is the 511 keV gamma ray excess from the\ngalactic center, which has been observed for 40 years,\nmost recently by the SPI spectrometer on the INTEGRAL satellite [1]; for a recent review see ref. [2]. Pulsars\n[3], gamma ray bursts [4], supernovae [5], low-mass x-ray\nbinaries [6], the galactic black hole [7] and anisotropic\npropagation effects [8] have been suggested as sources of\npositrons whose annihilation could explain the observations, but there is no consensus within the astrophysical\ncommunity as to which of these might be the right explanation.\nThere have also been many attempts to explain the\n511 keV signal using particle physics models, including\nannihilations of MeV scale dark matter (DM) [9] or millicharged DM [10], emission from cosmic strings [11],\ndecays of sterile neutrinos [12], axinos [13], moduli (or\nmodulinos) [14], WIMPs [15, 16], light photinos [17], or\nemission from composite objects [18]. Excited dark matter (XDM) [19] is a particularly appealing example, in\nwhich heavy DM particles in their ground state scatter\ninto excited states, \u03c70 \u03c70 \u2192 \u03c71 \u03c71 , with mass difference\n\u03b4M = M1 \u2212 M0 . The excited states subsequently decay\ninto e+ e\u2212 \u03c70 , where the leptons are approximately nonrelativistic due to the mass difference being close to the\n> 2m . If the different DM states\nthreshold value \u2206M \u223c\ne\nare members of a multiplet of a new hidden gauge symmetry, this framework has the advantage of being able\nto explain the small mass splittings naturally through\nquantum loop effects [20]; moreover the same class of\ntheories can potentially explain excess positrons seen by\nhigher energy experiments including ATIC [21], PPBBETS [22], PAMELA [23] and the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope [24].\n\nThe XDM proposal requires that the excitation cross\nsection be large, in fact close to the unitarity bound, in\nat least a few (and possibly many) partial waves [15],\n[25]. Ref. [19] made a first attempt to achieve such large\nvalues in a model where the excitation was mediated by\nexchange of a light scalar \u03c6 with m\u03c6 in the MeV\u2212GeV\nrange. It was recognized that one must resum ladder diagrams with multiple \u03c6 exchanges when the DM particles\nare scattering at low velocity, but a quantitatively reliable way of doing so was not yet appreciated at the time\nof this work.\nSubsequently ref. [20] showed how the calculation can\nbe set up in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum\nmechanics of a two-state system. It provides an example\nof the Sommerfeld enhancement [26, 27], which in the\nlast few years has been widely studied in the context of\ngalactic dark matter annihilations. However, unlike the\nsimpler one-state system where the enhancement can be\napproximated analytically, in the two-state system no analytic results for the excitation cross section are known\n(however see ref. [27] for recent progress in the annihilation cross section for multi-state DM). Ref. [28] made\na first attempt to numerically solve the two-state system and to perform a preliminary scan of the parameter\nspace. Technical challenges limited that analysis to relatively small coupling strengths of the exchanged boson\nto the dark matter. One goal in the present work is to\nextend these results to stronger couplings and to explore\nmore widely the range of possibilities, including the dependence on the mass of the exchanged boson. A second\nis to explore the dependence of the predicted rate on parameters of the dark matter density and velocity profiles\nin the galaxy.\nIn section II we review the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical formulation of the problem and give a classical\nestimate of the number of partial waves that can be expected to significantly contribute to the excitation cross\nsection. In section III we discuss the numerical method\nfor computing partial wave amplitudes fl as a function\n\n\f2\nof velocity, and present sample results for fl , as well as\na survey of the range of boost factors which arise from a\nbroad exploration of parameter space. In section IV we\nshow how these results go into the calculation of the rate\nof positron production in the galactic bulge; our choice\nof different DM density and velocity dispersion profiles\nis explained there. Section V presents the results of our\nscan of the XDM model's parameter space, consisting of\nthe interaction strength and the mass of the exchanged\nparticle, and the mass splitting between ground and excited state. We at first hold the DM mass M0 fixed at\na TeV [29], but then explore the dependence on M0 and\ngalactic DM distribution parameters at some optimal values of the microscopic parameters.\nOur results show that a large enough rate to match\nobservations cannot be achieved in the most straightforward implementation of the XDM scenario, but in section\nVI we review a modified version which can overcome this\ndeficit. In this version of XDM, dark matter has at least\nthree states; the middle state is stable or metastable and\ncan excite over a smaller gap to the highest state. In\nsection VII we compare the predictions for the angular\ndistribution of 511 keV gamma rays with the observed\nsignal. Conclusions are given in section VIII. Appendix\nA derives the Born approximation for the excitation cross\nsection, and B reviews the derivation of the radial dependence of the DM escape velocity.\nII.\n\nEXCITATION CROSS SECTION\n\nA key realization in ref. [20] is that the DM particles\nin the galaxy are highly nonrelativistic, and so it is not\nnecessary to use the full apparatus of quantum field theory to analyze their scattering. Instead one can use the\nlow energy effective theory, which is quantum mechanics.\nThis enormously simplifies the problem, getting around\nthe need to resum a perturbative expansion in ladder diagrams to find an effect which is nonperturbative, and\nenhanced by 1/v (or 1/v 2 ), the inverse velocity of the\nDM particles.\nA.\n\nQuantum mechanical analysis\n\nWe assume that the DM is Majorana and that its multiplicity arises from it being in a nontrivial representation\nof a nonabelian gauge symmetry. This immediately implies that any two members of the multiplet, say \u03c71 and\n\u03c72 , can only interact via off-diagonal couplings to the\ngauge boson. Furthermore the gauge symmetry should\nbe spontaneously broken so that \u03c71 and \u03c72 can be nondegenerate; then the exchanged vector boson gets a mass\n\u03bc. This leads to an attractive Yukawa potential, but only\nas an off-diagonal term in the matrix elements of the potential for the two-state system. It is important to note\nthat each state consists of two particles,\n|1i = |\u03c71 , \u03c71 i,\n\n|2i = |\u03c72 , \u03c72 i\n\n(1)\n\nby virtue of the fact that whenever a gauge boson is exchanged, the color of both DM particles has to change.\nThere also exist the states |\u03c71 , \u03c72 i and |\u03c72 , \u03c71 i which live\nin their own superselection sector, but we do not need to\nconsider them because \u03c72 is presumed to not be present\nin the initial state. The diagonal terms have no interactions; this part of the Hamiltonian consists only of the\nthe mass-energies of the two particles. Subtracting the\nmass of the ground state, 2M0 , the matrix potential in\nthe basis (1) is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n\u2212\u03b1g e\u2212\u03bcr /r\n(2)\nVij =\n\u2212\u03b1g e\u2212\u03bcr /r\n2\u03b4M\nwhere \u03b1g = g 2 /4\u03c0 is the fine structure constant for the\nSU(N) gauge coupling g. The wave function for the twostate system (with components\nlabeled by index i) in\nP\ni\nthe CM frame is \u03a8i =\nl Pl (cos \u03b8)Rkl (r), where k is\ni\nthe initial momentum. Defining \u03a6l,i (r) = Rkl\n/r, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk2\nl(l + 1)\n1 \u2032\u2032\n\u03a6\n=\n\u03a6l,i +\n\u03b4\n+\nV\n\u03a6l,i (3)\n\u2212\nl,j\nij\nij\nM0\nM0 r 2\nM0\n\nFor the numerical solution it is useful to rescale r =\n(\u03b1g /2\u03b4M )x and define the dimensionless variables\n\u03b12g\nk2\nv2\n\u03b1g \u03bc\n, \u2206=\n= 2, \u03b7 =\n(4)\n2\u03b4M\n2M0 \u03b4M\nvt\n2\u03b4M\np\nwhere vt = 2\u03b4M/M0 is the threshold velocity for producing the excited state. Then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ntakes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nl(l + 1)\n\u2212 \u03a6\u2032\u2032 +\n+\n\u0393(\nV\u0302\n\u2212\n\u2206)\n\u03a6 = 0,\n(5)\nx2\n!\n\u2212\u03b7x\n0\n\u2212e x\n(6)\nV\u0302 =\n\u2212\u03b7x\n1\n\u2212e x\n\u0393 = M0\n\nwith the dimensionless potential V\u0302 . We require \u2206 > 1\nfor the initial state to have enough energy to produce the\nheavier |\u03c72 , \u03c72 i final state.\nTo extract the scattering amplitudes, we decompose\nthe numerical solution into incoming and outgoing waves,\nout\nout\n\u03a6in\nl,1 , \u03a6l,1 and \u03a6l,2 . Partial wave unitarity implies the\n2\nout 2\n\u2032 out 2\nconservation of flux, k|\u03a6in\nl,1 | = k|\u03a6l,1 | +k |\u03a6l,2 | (where\n2\n\u20322 \u223c\nk = k \u2212 2M0 \u03b4M ), which we use as a check on our\nnumerics. The fraction of incoming |\u03c71 , \u03c71 i states which\ngets converted to the |\u03c72 , \u03c72 i final state is thus\nfl =\n\n2\nk \u2032 |\u03a6out\nl,2 |\n2\nk |\u03a6in\nl,1 |\n\n(7)\n\nin the lth partial wave. fl provides a measure of the\nextent to which a given partial wave can saturate the\nunitarity bound fl \u2264 1 for \u03c3l , its contribution to the\ncross section. The partial wave cross section is\n\u03c0(2l + 1)\nfl (v)\nM02 v 2\nP\nand the total cross section is \u03c3 = l \u03c3l .\n\u03c3l =\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nB.\n\nClassical treatment\n\nTo get additional insight, it is useful to think about\nthe classical version of the problem, in the limit where\nthe scattering is elastic. The standard method for solving the central potential problem is to change variables\nto u = 1/r and to solve for \u03b8(u) instead of r(t), where \u03b8\nis the polar angle in the scattering plane (see for example\nsection 4.5 of [30]). Take M\u0304 = 21 M0 to be the reduced\nmass. Then it is straightforward to solve the first integral of the motion for \u03b8(u) with initial conditions where\nthe particles have velocity v = vrel /2 in the center-ofmass frame and impact parameter b. Taking w = bu, the\nscattering angle is\n\u03b8s = \u03c0 \u2212 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nw0\n\n\u0012\ndw 1 \u2212 w2 +\n\n2\u03b1g \u2212\u03bcb/w\ne\n2\nM\u0304 b vrel\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere w0 \u223c 1 is the turning point of the effective potential, the point where the integrand diverges. Notice\nthat \u03b8s = 0 in the limit where the scattering potential\nvanishes. The result (9) shows the classical origin of the\nSommerfeld enhancement, where the effect of the potential is strengthened by the factor 1/v 2 at low velocities,\nsince the particle has more time to be influenced when it\nis moving slowly.\nWe can estimate the maximum angular momentum\nl = M0 vb which gives significant scattering by demanding\n2\n> 1. Solving for the argument of\nthat (2\u03b1g /M\u0304 bvrel\n)e\u2212\u03bcb \u223c\nthe exponential gives\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nM0\nM0\n\u03b1g\n\u03b1g \u03bc\nlmax \u223c\n(10)\n\u223c\nv ln\nv ln\n\u03bc\nv lmax\n\u03bc\nM0 v 2\nThe prefactor M0 v/\u03bc is what one would have obtained\nby assuming the range of the force is 1/\u03bc. Substituting\nthis estimate for lmax (without the logarithm) into the\nformula for the cross section (8) and assuming fl = 1 for\nall l < lmax results in the geometrical value of\u0001 the cross\nsection, \u03c3 = \u03c0/\u03bc2 . The extra ln \u03b1g \u03bc/M0 v 2 factor is\nthe origin of the Sommerfeld enhancement, which boosts\nthe cross section by the square of the logarithm for lowvelocity scattering.\nFor the inelastic process, these classical insights need\nto be modified, since there is a threshold v > vt for production of the excited state. Nevertheless they provide\nsome idea as to how many partial waves one may expect\nto be important in the quantum mechanical cross section\n(7).\n\nIII.\n\nPARTIAL WAVE AMPLITUDES\n\nIn this section we describe our method of numerical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, leading to the partial\nwave amplitudes fl (v). In each partial wave, one boundary condition is that there are only incoming waves of\nstate |1i from r = \u221e, whereas the outgoing waves are\n\nan admixture of |1i and |2i. Specifically, |2i must approach an eigenstate of radial momentum with positive\neigenvalue,\n\u2212i\n\n\u2202\n\u03a6l,2 = k \u2032 \u03a6l,2\n\u2202r\n\n(11)\n\n\u221a\nwhere k \u2032 = k 2 \u2212 2M0 \u03b4M . This constitutes two conditions, one for the real part and one for the imaginary\npart of the wave function. At the origin, both components behave like rl+1 , but their relative amplitudes are\nnot known, so one must parametrize \u03a6l \u223c rl+1 ( 1b ) with\nb a complex number. We thus have a shooting problem:\nthe real and imaginary parts of b must be adjusted so as\nto satisfy the two boundary conditions at infinity. Standard algorithms exist for this kind of problem; we adopt\nthe routines in ref. [31].\nInstead of shooting, one can alternatively use a simpler approach, which is to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwith the correct rl+1 behavior near r = 0, but arbitrary\nrelative amplitudes of \u03a6l,1 and \u03a6l,2 , to obtain some solution \u03a60 , which does not have the right behavior at large\nr. Since the complex conjugate \u03a6\u22170 is also a solution,\none can algebraically construct the b linear combination\na\u03a60 + b\u03a6\u22170 that has the desired behavior at large r. This\nis much faster than shooting because no iteration is required.\nIn principle, the method is straightforward, but complications arise when one tries to consider\nparameters in\np\nthe regime \u0393 \u226b 1, that is, \u03b1g \u226b 2\u03b4M/M0 . Notice\nthat this need not be a particularly strong coupling for\nthe application we have in mind, where \u03b4M \u223c 2me and\nM \u223c TeV: then \u03b1g \u226b 10\u22123 . The algorithms break down\nexcept when \u03b7, which determines the dark gauge boson\nmass, is sufficiently large. The problem arises from the\nneed to consider very different scales 1/\u0393 and 1/\u03b7; in\nparticular the wave function oscillates many times in the\ninteraction region x < 1/\u03b7. Then (we suspect) the solution with the desired behavior at large r becomes an exponentially small component of the generic solution, and\nso its extraction gets lost in the numerical noise. Despite\nthis limitation, we will be able to explore the parameter\nspace widely enough to see how the results extrapolate\nto the difficult regions, and thus give a complete characterization of the solutions.\n\nA.\n\nResults for fl\n\nWe show two examples of the results for fl , eq. (7) in\nfigure 1, as a function of \u2206 \u2212 1 = v 2 /vt2 \u2212 1; recall that\nv is the velocity of one of the particles in the center of\nmass frame, and vt is the threshold velocity for producing\nthe excited DM states. These results look quite different\nfrom the usual single-state s-wave Sommerfeld enhancement, which has numerous sharp resonance bands at low\nvelocity. Here, there can be at best a few oscillations\nin a given partial wave, but not strongly peaked.

Each curve is labeled by its\npartial wave l. Bottom: same, but showing region of smaller velocities.\n\nmight be due to having an approximately integral number of wavelengths within the width of the potential well,\nwhich of course is not square and so one would not expect nearly bound resonances to be very sharp. It would\nbe interesting to find an analytic approximation to help\nbetter understand these results. We tried to develop the\nWKB approximation in this context, but without success.1\nFor clarity in figure 1 we have chosen examples where\nthe number of partial waves which contribute significantly are relatively small, but for our actual computations,\u221athere are examples (particularly for small values of\n\u03b7 \u226a \u0393) where hundreds of partial waves are relevant.\nUsing the estimate (10), and the definitions (4), we find\nlmax\n\n\u221a\n\u03b7\n\u0393\u2206\nln\n\u223c\n\u03b7\n\u2206\n\n(12)\n\nWe typically computed up to lmax = 500 to insure convergence of the sum over l in the cross section, and we\nrestrict ourselves to gauge boson masses, hence values\n\n1\n\nAt least in some regions of parameter space, the WKB approximation fails due to the breakdown of matching conditions at\nthe classical turning point. It is possible that more sophisticated approximate analytical techniques such as those used in\n[27] ameliorate this problem.\n\n\u221a\nof \u03b7 \u223c \u0393, which are large enough to justify neglecting\nhigher values of l (it also turns out that the interesting functional\n\u221a dependence of \u03c3 on \u03b7 occurs in the region\nwhere \u03b7 \u223c \u0393). It will be apparent from the results\nthat this is a mild restriction, in terms of understanding\ntrends across the full parameter space of the model.\n\nB.\n\nBoost factors\n\nThere is a large literature on the Sommerfeld enhancement for s-wave annihilation of DM at low velocities,\nwhere the effect is characterized by a boost factor, defined\nas the ratio of the enhanced cross section to the Born approximation value. Even though all our results for the\nscattering cross section are computed directly, without\nreference to the perturbative value, one might nevertheless be interested to know their ratio in the present context.

(4), \u0393 = 10, . . . , 105 (rows) and \u03b7 \u223c few \u00d7 \u0393 (columns). We assume M0 = 1\nTeV, and the curves in each panel correspond to \u03b4M = 0.2, . . . , 1 MeV, from top to bottom.\n\np\nwhere \u01eb = 2M02 vt2 \u2206(\u2206 \u2212 1)/(\u03bc2 + M02 vt2 (2\u2206 \u2212 1)), and\nwe have assumed \u03b4M \u226a \u03bc \u226a M0 to simplify the expression; see appendix A for details.\nIn figure 2 we plot the resulting boost factors as a\nfunction of center-of-mass velocity of the incoming particles, for the same range of parameters that we explore\nin the next section as being relevant for positron\n\u221a production, namely \u0393 = 10, . . . , 105 and \u03b7 \u223c few\u00d7 \u0393, for\n\u03b4M = 0.2, 0.4, . . . , 1 MeV, and assuming a DM mass\nof M0 = 1 TeV. From the figure it is apparent that the\n\"boost factor\" is an enhancement only for the smaller values of \u0393, and is actually a suppression factor for \u0393 > 100,\nin the range of velocities where we have computed. One\ncan see the onset of resonant enhancement at low velocity in the cases of \u0393 = 10 and 100, where the boost\nfactor suddenly increases as a function of the dimensionless gauge boson mass parameter \u03b7. For fixed parameters\n\u0393, \u03b7, \u2206, we see from each family of curves that smallest\nvalues of \u03b4M give the largest cross section. This can be\nunderstood as being due to Sommerfeld enhancement,\nsince for fixed \u2206 decreasing \u03b4M corresponds to decreasing the particle velocities.\n\nOne check on these results is provided by considering\nwhen the Born approximation for our potential should\nbe valid. By demanding that the scattered wave be small\ncompared to the incoming wave in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, and working in Rthe limit of low velocity,\n\u221e\none obtains the constraint 2M0 | 0 rV (r)dr| \u226a 1, which\nimplies 2\u03b1g M0 \u226a \u03bc, or in terms of the parameters (4),\n2\u0393 \u226a \u03b7. This is violated everywhere in the region of\nparameter space we have considered, so there is no contradiction between our results and expectations based on\nthe Born approximation.\nIV.\n\nRATE OF POSITRON PRODUCTION\n\nThe rate of positron production within a radius rc of\nthe galactic center is given by\nZ\n1 rc\nRe+ =\nh\u03c3vrel in2 (r) 4\u03c0r2 dr\n(14)\n2 0\nwhere n(r) = \u03c1(r)/M0 is the DM number density and\n\u03c1(r) is its mass density.

Fitting the results of figure 2 in ref. [35], we\nfind the velocity dispersion\n\u03c3v (r) = v0\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nr\u22122\n\n\u0013\u22121/4\n\nan logn10 (r/kpc)\n\n(26)\n\nn=0\n\nBDM\nPDM, Einasto\nPDM, NFW\n\n-1\n\n4\nX\n\n(25)\n\nwhere v0 happens to take the same value as in (24). Its\nshape is plotted in figure 4. The rise in v toward the\ngalactic center can greatly boost the excitation rate of\nDM relative to the pure dark matter case, (23), and we\nwill employ both for the purposes of comparison.\nThere is some disagreement between the different BDM\nsimulations as to the impact of the baryons on the DM\ndensity profile. Ref. [35] finds that the cusp of the density distribution is softened (we refer to it as a \"cored\"\nprofile), while ref. [37] obtains profiles that are consistent\n\nwith coefficients an = 1.7487, 0.0395, \u22122.537, 1.459,\n\u22120.3448, respectively, for n = 0, . . . , 4. This profile is\nplotted along with the NFW and Einasto forms (20)-(21)\nin figure 3 in the region 1 kpc < r < 10 kpc. For larger r,\nthe three shapes are in closer agreement, while for r < 1\nkpc the BDM profile is taken to be constant.\nOther BDM simulations do not find the erasure of the\ncusp; ref. [37] finds good fits to the Einasto profile with a\nrange of \u03b1 values that are consistent with (22), but that\ngo as low as \u03b1 = 0.145. To illustrate the effect of the \u03b1\nparameter on the rate, we will consider this lower value\nin addition to the higher one \u03b1 = 0.17 in (22).\n\nC.\n\nConsistency of velocity distributions\n\nStrictly speaking, the velocity distributions (23,25)\nmay not be self-consistent when varying the dark matter density profile. A better approximation to the selfconsistent distribution could be derived from the Jeans\nequation, following the technique of [38], for example.\nHowever, our results are much more sensitive to the shape\nof the density profile than the detailed velocity profile, so\nan improved treatment of the velocity profile should only\nlead to qualitatively small changes in our results. Figure\n6, for example, shows that the rate of positron production\nis relatively insensitive to the scale of the BDM velocity\ndistribution v0 near or above the standard value (24).\nWe do however, find an enhancement in positron production in going from the PDM velocity dispersion profile\n(23) to the more cuspy BDM profile (25). We therefore\nmight worry about overestimating the positron production rate if a self-consistent treatment removes the cusp\nin the profile. We believe it is more conservative to consider the cuspy profile (25), as we are interested in determining whether or not the XDM mechanism is viable\nfor \u03b4M & 2me . Even with the advantageous profile (25),\nwe still find that the positron production rate is only\nsufficient for smaller \u03b4M .\n\nV.\n\nSURVEY OF PARAMETER SPACE\n\nThere are four important dimensionless parameters\nthat determine the rate of scatterings to produce the\nXDM states in the galaxy.

The contour labeled \"0\" corresponds to the observed rate of\npositron production. The distance to the galactic center is fixed at R0 = 8 kpc in the top right panel (and the left ones),\nwhereas it varies linearly with vc in the bottom right one. Other parameters are fixed at \u0393 = 104 , \u03b7 = 50, \u03b1 = 0.145 to\nmaximize the rate, and the BDM velocity profile is used.\n\nDependence on a, b arises from averaging the cross section over the velocity distribution of the DM. In ref. [15],\na simpler estimate of the rate was made using the isother2\n2\nmal distribution function, f (v) = N v 2 e\u2212v /v0 , giving\n2\n\u221a\nZ vesc\n2 \u03c0 X\ndv 2 \u2212v2 /v02\nh\u03c3vrel i = 2\n(2l + 1)\nfl (v) (28)\ne\nM0 v0\nv02\nvt2\n\nl\n\nwhere vesc is the escape velocity, also taken to be constant\nand in the range \u223c 500 \u2212 600 km/s.3 In the limit of large\na, b, the rate is exponentially suppressed, \u223c (e\u2212a \u2212 e\u2212b ).\nAlthough we are calculating the rate more quantitatively\nin this paper, the simpler approach makes it clear how to\nexpect the results to depend on a, b, at least semiquantitatively. In terms of dimensionful constants and the\ndimensionless ratios, one can parametrize the rate in the\nform\nRe+ =\n\n3\n\u03c12\u22122 r\u22122\ng(\u0393, \u03b7, a, b)\nM04 v0\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the function g of the dimensionless variables has\ncomplicated dependence on \u0393 and \u03b7, but roughly (e\u2212a \u2212\ne\u2212b ) dependence on a, b. The contours of log(e\u2212a \u2212 e\u2212b )\n\n3\n\nThis estimate assumes that vesc \u226b v0 so that N \u223c v0\u22123 . In\nthe unphysical limit vesc \u226a v0 , the normalization factor goes to\n\u22123\nN \u223c vesc\n.\n\nin the a-b plane are roughly linear over some ranges, suggesting that there should be a quasilinear degeneracy be2\ntween the parameters \u03b4M and vesc\n, which we will observe\nbelow.\n\nA.\n\nDependence on \u0393, \u03b7, \u03b4M\n\nFor our initial exploration of parameter space, we computed the scattering rate for values \u0393 = \u03b12g M0 /2\u03b4M =\n101 , 102 , . . . , 105 ; this is the parameter that is most directly associated with the strength of the dark gauge interaction since it multiplies the potential in (6). For each\nvalue of \u0393, we explore a range of \u03b7 = \u03b1g \u03bc/2\u03b4M (recall\nthat \u03b7 determines the range of the interaction since \u03bc\nis the gauge boson mass) that includes the region where\nthe rate of excitations is maximized. For each value of\n\u0393, we calculated contours of the positron production rate\nRe+ in the \u03b7-a plane. However to make the presentation\nmore concrete, instead of using the dimensionless variable a, we momentarily assume that the model should\nalso account for the positron excesses seen by PAMELA\nand Fermi/LAT, the latter of which suggests that M0 \u223c\n=1\nTeV [29]. This enables us to plot the contours in the \u03b7\u03b4M plane. An important question is whether the rate\ncan ever be large enough if \u03b4M \u2265 2me since in the most\nnatural models, each excited state must have enough energy to decay into an e+ -e\u2212 pair.\nIn figure 5 we display results for three cases with the\n\n\f10\nBDM velocity dispersion (25) and different assumptions\nfor the density profile, and one example with the PDM\ndispersion (23). The largest rates are obtained in the\nformer case, using cuspy density profiles, and \u0393 = 104 .\nEven in this most favorable case however, the mass splitting cannot exceed 600 keV if the predicted rate is to\nmatch the observed one. The cored BDM density profile\nand the PDM velocity profile give much smaller rates,\nwith correspondingly smaller upper limits on \u03b4M , 170\nkeV and 200 keV respectively.\n\nB.\n\nDependence on other parameters\n\nIdeally one would like to find examples where the predicted rate can match observations for mass splittings\n> 2m , since in the simplest models each excited DM\n\u03b4M \u223c\ne\nstate must decay into the ground state plus e+ e\u2212 . Toward this end, we have explored the dependence on other\nparameters which we previously held fixed. For this purpose we fix instead the microscopic parameters at one of\nthe highest-rate examples found in fig. 5. Namely we\ntake \u0393 = 104 , \u03b7 = 50, using the BDM velocity profile, and Einasto density profile with \u03b1 = 0.145. We\nvary the DM mass M0 , the velocity dispersion parameter\nv0 , and the circular velocity parameter vc . Recently ref.\n[39] presented evidence, based on trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers in star-forming regions of the Milky Way, favoring a surprisingly large\nvalue vc = 254 \u00b1 16 km/s. The claim has been criticized in subsequent references [40, 41]; in particular ref.\n[41] notes that the method used only constrains the ratio\nvc /R0 \u223c\n= 30 km/s/kpc, where R0 is the distance to the\ngalactic center. We therefore also consider the variation\nof vc and R0 together.\nThe results are shown in figure 6. The top left figure\nshows that there is an optimal value of M0 \u223c\n= 600 GeV\nfor maximizing the rate, where \u03b4M = 650 keV gives the\nobserved rate. This can be understood from the analytic\napproximation (29) where for fixed \u03b4M , the rate scales\nas a4 e\u2212a \u223c M0\u22124 e\u2212c/M0 . The bottom left figure shows\nthat the dependence on v0 , which controls the overall size\nof the DM velocity dispersion, is quite weak for values\nabove the standard one v0 \u223c\n= 220 km/s (see footnote 3\nfor explanation). As expected, decreasing v0 below this\nvalue only reduces the rate.\nThe right panels of figure 6 show the dependence on the\ncircular velocity vc , which controls the escape velocity of\nthe DM. Keeping R0 fixed, the upper right panel demonstrates that vc would have to be increased to 350 km/s\nto allow for \u03b4M as large as 2me . However increasing R0\nin a correlated way, as suggested by ref. [41], allows for a\nstronger effect, because the cutoff rc on the radial integration in eq. (14) increases proportionally with R0 . In\nthis case, one would need vc = 280 km/s and R0 = 9.4\nkpc. Such a large value of vc is 4\u03c3 away from the recent\nmean determination of 236 \u00b1 11 km/s [40] and that of\nR0 is 2.5\u03c3 and 3.1\u03c3 outside the preferred values of refs.\n\n\u03c72\n\u03c71 \u03b4M ~100 keV\n\u03c70\n\n\u2206M >\n~ 1 MeV\n\nFIG. 7: Spectrum of states for inverted mass hierarchy.\n\n[42, 43] respectively.\nWe conclude that, by taking all parameters and distribution functions to their limits, it may be marginally\npossible to excite dark matter with a mass splitting as\nlarge as 2me , although most practitioners would probably regard the required values of vc = 280 km/s and\nR0 = 9.4 kpc as being unreasonably large.\n\nVI.\n\nALTERNATIVE XDM SCENARIOS AND\nTEV DARK MATTER\n\nIn ref. [28] it was pointed out that a long-lived species\n\u03c71 with a mass splitting \u2206M \u223c 2me above the ground\nstate \u03c70 could be excited to a third state \u03c72 with splitting \u03b4M \u226a 2me in an \"inverted mass hierarchy\" scenario,\nwhose spectrum is shown in fig. 7. Then the XDM mechanism can work via the excitations \u03c71 \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c72 \u03c72 followed\nby the decays \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 . The reduced value of \u03b4M\nallows the rate to be large enough to match observations\nwithout requiring extreme values for parameters of the\ngalactic velocity profile.\nSimple models of nonabelian DM with hidden SU(2)\ngauge symmetry were constructed in ref. [44] to realize\nthis possibility. The scenario comes with the expense\nof needing a late-time nonthermal origin for the DM, as\nexplained in [28] (see also [45]), since otherwise the same\nprocess needed for positron production in the galaxy will\ndepopulate the \u03c71 states in the early universe. If the\nDM goes out of kinetic equilibrium early enough, a small\nremnant of its initial relic density can be maintained; ref.\n[25] optimistically estimates that \u223c 1/10 of the initially\nproduced relic density can survive. In this case we would\nneed parameters corresponding to a rate Re+ /Robs = 100\nto compensate for the \u03c12 \u223c 0.01 suppression in the rate,\nrelative to the assumed case of a standard relic density.\nThe upper right-hand panel of figure 5 (corresponding to\nBDM with a steep Einasto profile) reveals such examples\n(the contours labeled \"2\") when \u0393 \u223c 103 \u2212104 and \u03b4M \u223c\n50 keV.\nIn the case of nonthermally-produced intermediate\nstates, in order for this component of the DM to dominate\nover the conventionally produced thermal component of\nthe ground state, it is necessary to have an annihilation\ncross section that is stronger than the one needed for the\nstandard thermal relic density, which was computed for\n\n\f11\nwhere r\u0303 is distance along the line of sight, and r2 (r\u0303, \u03c6) =\nR02 + r\u03032 \u22122r\u0303R0 cos \u03c6, as illustrated in fig. 8.

Referring to\nfig. 5, we see that these can be satisfied for the top panels,\nwhich use Einasto profile and BDM velocity dispersion,\neven at \u0393 = 10. There thus seems to be considerable\nroom in the parameter space for the XDM explanation\nof low-energy galactic center positrons, if one accepts the\ninverted mass hierarchy hypothesis and a relic density of\nintermediate mass states.\nVII.\n\nANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nFurther constraints can be obtained by computing the\nexpected angular profiles of the produced positrons. This\ngives one-sided bounds, because there is considerable uncertainty in the distance that a positron could propagate\naway from the galactic center before annihilating. But a\nmodel that predicts too wide an angular profile can be\nexcluded since propagation effects will never make the\ntrue profile more narrow.\nNeglecting propagation effects, the angular distribution of positrons is given by an integral similar to that in\n(14), but instead of integrating over the volume, one must\nintegrate along the line of sight. We define a luminosity\nL(\u03c6) by\nL(\u03c6) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nh\u03c3vrel i(r) n2 (r) dr\u0303\n\n(33)\n\nwhere c = \u03c0(3\u25e6 /180\u25e6)/(23/2 ln 2).\nOur results for the angular profile are shown in fig. 9,\nfor sample microphysics parameters \u0393 = 100 and \u03b7 = 3.5.\nWe find that the shapes are relatively insensitive to these\nvalues, and rather depend more strongly on the DM density and velocity profiles, and the parameters a, b defined\nin (27). For the first five panels of this figure, we have ignored the overall rate and normalized all curves to match\nthe observed profile at the galactic center, to better visualize the differences in widths of the predicted signals.\nThe bottom right panel shows the real rate corresponding to each assumed density profile, as a function of \u03b4M\n(assuming M0 = 1 TeV as before).\nOne can see that for the larger values of \u03b4M , the pure\ndark matter velocity profiles (as well as cored BDM) produce too wide a profile to match the observations, while\nthe cuspy BDM case gives a narrower result that can\nbe consistent if the positrons travel a distance of order\n1 kpc before annihilating, as has been argued is possible [46]. This indicates that the kinematic advantage of\nhaving higher central velocities in the BDM scenario is\nmore important than the boost to the cross section that\none would expect from the Sommerfeld enhancement at\nlower velocities. Thus not only are the cuspy BDM profiles more easily able to match the observed rate, but\nthey are also more consistent with the observed angular\ndistribution.\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have tried to give the most quantitative treatment to date of the excited dark matter mechanism for producing positrons at the galactic center. A\nmain technical improvement was the numerical computation of the excitation scattering cross section, which is\nnonperturbative and guaranteed to satisfy unitarity constraints. A second difference relative to previous treatments is that we included the effects of baryons on the\nvelocity dispersion of DM in the inner kpc of the galaxy,\nwhich can significantly boost the rate of excitations. In\naddition we considered NFW and Einasto profiles for the\nDM density, varying parameters determining the cuspiness of the distributions, as well as those affecting the\nvelocity distributions.\nEven making all the most optimistic assumptions for\nincreasing the rate of DM excitations, we were not able to\nfind realistic parameter values which yield a large enough\nrate, if the mass gap between the ground state \u03c70 and\nexcited state \u03c71 of the DM is sufficient for the subsequent\n\n\f\u03b4 M = 0.04 MeV\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\u03c6 [degrees]\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n\u03b4 M = 1.13 MeV\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\u03c6 [degrees]\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n\u03b4 M = 0.19 MeV\nRelative flux\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\u03c6 [degrees]\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n\u03b4 M = 0.38 MeV\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\u03c6 [degrees]\n\n10 2\n\n\u03b4 M = 1.19 MeV\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\nEinasto/PDM\nEinasto/BDM\nNFW/PDM\nCored/BDM\n\n101\nR/Robs\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\nObserved signal\nEinasto/PDM\nEinasto/BDM\nNFW/PDM\nCored/BDM\n\nRelative flux\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\nRelative flux\n\nRelative flux\n\nRelative flux\n\n12\n\n100\n10\u22121\n10\u22122\n10\u22123\n\nRate\n\n10\u22124\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 5 6 7\n\u03c6 [degrees]\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n0.1\n\n\u03b4 M (MeV c\u22122)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 9: Comparison of the predicted and observed angular profiles for \u0393 = 100, \u03b7 = 3.5 and five values of \u03b4M , also varying\nthe density profiles. All curves are normalized to 1 at r = 0 to emphasize the differences in shape. Bottom right graph shows\ndependence of the actual rate on \u03b4M for these same density profiles, assuming that M0 = 1 TeV.\n\ndecay \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 to produce the positron. The largest\nmass gap we found consistent with the observed rate was\n\u03b4M \u223c\n= 650 keV, assuming the standard values vc = 220\nkm/s and R0 = 8 kpc, respectively, for the circular velocity of the sun around and its distance to the galactic\ncenter. By pushing these values to vc = 280 km/s and\nR0 = 9.4 kpc, we can barely accommodate a mass gap of\n\u03b4M = 2me , but these choices are respectively 4\u03c3 and 3\u03c3\naway from the mean values.\nOne way to ease the tension would be to consider models where the excited states are charged and thus able to\ndecay into single electrons or positrons; this would lower\nthe required mass gap to just \u03b4M = me . But this requires a great deal more model-building gymnastics than\nthe case of a neutral excited state. A theoretically more\nappealing alternative is the case of three DM states where\n\u03c70 \u03c70 \u2192 \u03c71 \u03c72 , in which the mass gap \u03b4M01 between \u03c70\nand \u03c71 is much smaller than \u03b4M02 > 2me [44, 47]. For\nexample if \u03b4M01 = 0, then the effective \u03b4M which determines the threshold velocity is half as large as in the\nmodels that produce two of the same excited state. This\npossibility can arise if the hidden sector gauge group is\nSU(2)\u00d7U(1) and gets completely broken, for example.\nHowever to see if this class of models can really have a\nlarger rate would require solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the three-state system, so while it is plausible that\nsuch asymmetric excitations could increase the rate, it is\nnot proven by our analysis.\nAnother way of getting around our no-go result is to\nassume the existence of a stable or metastable population of already excited states \u03c71 , which need only be\n\nfurther excited to \u03c72 through a small mass gap \u03b4M12 ,\nif \u03b4M02 is assumed to be greater than 2me so that the\ndecay \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 is allowed. We refer to this as the\ninverted mass hierarchy scenario. This idea comes with\nnew complications, since it is difficult to prevent the excitation process from occuring earlier in the history of\nthe universe, to maintain the population of \u03c71 to the\npresent day. However there is an intriguing possibility to\novercome this by assuming the present DM particles are\nproducts of the late decay of a much heavier predecessor, and thus were initially relativistic, at a time when\nthey would normally have been nonrelativistic had they\nbeen produced through conventional freeze-out [28]. The\nhigher velocity suppresses the Sommerfeld enhancement\nat early times, when it would have the undesirable effect\nof depleting the metastable intermediate DM states. We\nhope to examine this scenario more carefully in future\nwork.\nWe have not tried to impose in detail the additional\nconstraints on the model which arise if one would like it\nto also account for the PAMELA and Fermi/LAT excess\nelectrons/positrons, although we did focus on TeV scale\nDM for that purpose. If the DM explanation of the highenergy leptons is not ruled out by upcoming analyses,\nthis would be an interesting next step. It might also be\nworthwhile to investigate the effect of a nonspherically\nsymmetric DM halo [48] on the rate of positron production.\nAcknowledgment: We thank Gil Holder for valuable\ndiscussions about the galactic parameters.\n\n\f13\nAppendix A: Born approximation cross section\n\nFor comparison with the nonrelativistic excitation\ncross section from numerical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger\n\n2\n\nequation, we here give the quantum field theoretic expression in the Born approximation.

[19] for the r-dependence of the escape velocity. It\nis important to notice that dark matter does not dominate the mass of the inner galaxy. To account for the\ngravitational effect of the baryons, one can use the fact\nthat the circular velocity vc (the velocity of a test mass\non a circular orbit around the galactic centre), is nearly\nconstant out to radii or order r\u22122 . We make the simplifying assumptions that there is no mass beyond r = r\u22122\nand that the density is spherically symmetric.\nThe gravitational potential is\nZ \u221e\nM (r\u2032 ) \u2032\n\u03a6 = \u2212G\ndr .\n(B1)\nr\u20322\nr\n\nwhere M (r), the mass within radius r, can be inferred\nfrom F = ma for a test particle of mass m: mvc2 /r =\nGmM (r)/r2 .
