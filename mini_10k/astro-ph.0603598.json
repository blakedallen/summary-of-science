High resolution samples of QSOs' Ly\u03b1 absorption\nspectra are important to test models of cosmic structure formation on small scales. Recently,\nthe H I Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux of HE2347-4342 has been used to compare with hydrodynamical\nsimulation samples of the \u039bCDM model (Jamkhedkar et al. 2005, here after Paper I). The\nresults suggest that the \u039bCDM model is successful in explaining the power spectrum and\nintermittency of the HE2347-4342 sample. There is no discrepancy between the simulated\nand observed flux fields with regards to their statistical behavior from the second to the\neighth orders and till the comoving scales as small as about 0.28 h\u22121 Mpc. This result seems\nnot to support the necessity of reducing the power of density perturbations relative to the\nstandard \u039bCDM model on small scales, as was implied by the lack of dense cores in the halo's\ncenter given by the so-called universal density profile (Flores & Primack 1994; Swaters et al.\n2003; McGaugh et al. 2003; Zentner & Bullock 2003; Simon et al. 2003)\nThe IGM is also traced by He II Ly\u03b1 absorption. Because the ionizing threshold of He II\nis high (54.4 eV), and recombination rate of He III is also high, the He II Ly\u03b1 absorption\nof IGM generally is much stronger than H I Ly\u03b1. Therefore, it is expected that the He II\nLy\u03b1 forest and transmitted flux of high redshift QSOs can play a similar role as H I forests\nin constraining cosmological models, and can even yield stronger constraints on the models\nthan H I forests (Zhang et al. 1995; Croft et al. 1997). However, due to the lack of He II\ndata, the comparison of He II spectra between model predictions and observations could not\nbe made in a similar way as for H I Ly\u03b1 absorption spectra. Thanks to the F USE data of\nHE2347-4342, we can obtain moderate resolution spectra of He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux in\nthe redshift range 2.0 < z < 2.9 (Kriss et al. 2001). It provides the possibility of making a\nsimilar analysis as for the H I transmitted flux.\nWe cannot simply repeat the analysis as Paper I, because of a new problem: the ratio\nbetween the optical depths of He II and H I, \u03b7 = 4\u03c4HeII /\u03c4HI . If assuming 1.) the effect of\nthermal broadening and peculiar velocities of IGM are negligible, and 2.) He II and H I are\nin photoionization equilibrium, the ratio \u03b7 should basically be constant, and have a low level\nof scatter because \u03b7 is weakly dependent on the temperature of IGM. Observations reveal,\nhowever, that \u03b7 is significantly scattered from pixel to pixel, or from line to line (Kriss et al.\n2001; Smette et al. 2002). For the F USE data of HE2347-4342, the scatter of \u03b7 is from 1 to\na few hundreds (Shull et al. 2004), and even as high as \u2243 104 (Zheng et al. 2004).\nThe large \u03b7-scatter has been used as an indicator of the inhomogeneity of UV radiation\nbackground caused by the radiation transfer (RT) of the UV photons in a nonuniform density\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nfield. A 3-dimensional radiation transfer calculation on the shadowing, self-shielding and\nfiltering predicted that the mean of \u03b7 should be as large as h\u03b7i > 200 (Maselli & Ferrara\n2005). However, the observed result is h\u03b7i < 100 (Zheng et al. 2004; Shull et al. 2004).\nTherefore, the RT effect explanation of \u03b7 scatter is far from settling. This result motivated\nus to reconsider the assumptions above mentioned. If above-mentioned assumptions 1.) and\n2.) are not hold, the \u03b7-scatter would not be a direct measurement of the inhomogeneity of\nUV background.\nIn this paper, we will study the effect of thermal broadening and peculiar velocities on\nthe H I and He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux. It has been shown recently that in nonlinear regime\nthe velocity field v(x) of cosmic baryon matter consists of strong shocks on various spatial\nscales and in high and low mass density area (Kim et al. 2005). The statistical behavior\nof the velocity field is similar to a fully developed turbulence (He et al. 2006). Therefore,\nthe effect of thermal broadening and peculiar velocities of IGM would not be negligible. We\nshould, at least, estimate the imprints of the non-trivial velocity field on the Ly\u03b1 forests of\nHe II and H I.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the observed data of HE23474342. Section 3 presents the method to simulate the Ly\u03b1 forests of He II and H I. As in\nPaper I, we use the WIGEON method of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to produce\nthe simulation samples, as this code is especially effective in capturing singular and complex\nstructures (Feng et al. 2004). On the other hand, He II would be formed in hotter gas,\nsuch as shock heated IGM (Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001), a method of effectively\nsimulating shocks would be important. Velocity field effect on absorption width is shown in\nSection 4. Section 5 presents the analysis of the ratio between the optical depths of He II\nand H I Ly\u03b1 transmissions. The power spectrum of the H I and He II flux will be discussed\nin \u00a76. Discussions and conclusions are given in \u00a77.\n2.\n\nData of HE2347-4342\n\nThe data of H I Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux used in this paper is the same as in Paper I.\nThe F USE data of the He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux of HE2347-4342 is described in Zheng\net al. (2004). The wavelength region is 904 \u2212 1188 \u00c5, which corresponds to the redshift\nrange 2.0 \u2264 z \u2264 2.9, as the wavelength 303.78 \u00c5 of He II Ly\u03b1 in rest frame. The spectrum\nhas a constant bin size of \u2206\u03bb = 0.025 \u00c5. In terms of the local velocity, the resolution is\ndv \u2243 8.3 \u2212 6.3 km s\u22121 , and mean dv \u2243 7 km s\u22121 . The mean S/N is 2.14. Following the\napproach of Shull et al. (2004), we bin the data into \u2206\u03bb = 0.05 \u00c5 to reduce uncertainties\nin the effective spectrograph resolution and oversampling effect. The distance between N\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\npixels in the units of the local velocity scale is given by \u03b4v = 2c[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212Ndv/2c)] km s\u22121 ,\ncorresponding to comoving scale D = \u03b4v(1 + z)/H(z).\nThe flux in 2729 pixels, i.e., 24% of the total pixels, are less than zero. Obviously,\nthe points with negative flux is unphysical, it should be excluded in the statistics below.\nFor sample deleting all the pixels with negative flux, the mean transmission about 0.4, or\neffective optical depth \u223c 0.9. The optical depths of He II over the ranges from 0.1 to 2.3\nare with 10% uncertainties. A better statistical measurement of the fluctuations of flux is\ngiven by the ratio between the optical depths of He II, \u03c4HeII , and H I, \u03c4HI , for each pixel.\nThe distribution of \u03b7 is scattered in the range from 0.1 to about 500, while the mean of \u03b7 is\n\u2243 80 (Shull et al. 2004).\nWe also assume that all absorption in the F USE spectrum is due to He II, although\nit is subject to metal-line contaminations. Generally identified metal-lines are connected\nwith a Lyman-limit system (Smette et al. 2002). The Doppler width of metal lines are\ngenerally narrow with \u03b4v \u2264 20 km s\u22121 . In this paper, we restrict our analysis only to scales\n\u03b4v \u2265 30 km s\u22121 where metal-line contaminations is low (Hu et al. 1995; Boksenberg et al.\n2003; Kim et al. 2004).\n\n3.\n\nHydrodynamic simulation sample\n3.1.\n\nMethod\n\nWe use the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation samples produced by the Weno for\nIntergalactic medium and Galaxy Evolution and formatiON (WIGEON) code developed by\nFeng et al. (2004). It is a hybrid hydrodynamic/N-body simulation, consisting of the WENO\nalgorithm (Jiang & Shu 1996) for baryonic fluid, and N-body simulation for particles of dark\nmatter. The baryon fluid obeys the Navier-Stokes equation, and is gravitationally coupled\nwith collisionless dark matter. We have assumed a standard \u039bCDM model, which is specified\nby the matter density parameter \u03a9m = 0.27, baryonic matter density parameter \u03a9b = 0.044,\ncosmological constant \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, Hubble constant h = 0.71, the mass fluctuation \u03c38 = 0.84,\nand scale-free spectrum index n = 1. The ratio of specific heats of the IGM is \u03b3 = 5/3. The\ntransfer function is calculated using CMBFAST (Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996).\nThe simulation was performed in a periodic, cubic box of size 50 h\u22121 Mpc with a 5123\ngrid and an equal number of dark matter particles. It starts at redshift z = 99. A uniform\nUV-background of ionizing photons is switched on at z = 6 to heat the gas and reionize the\nuniverse. To mimic the enhancement of temperature due to radiation transfer effects (Abel\n& Haehnelt 1999), a thermal energy of gas with T = 2 \u00d7 104 K is added in the total energy\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nat z = 6. The clumpy universe would reprocess the photon spectrum from ionizing sources.\nThe reprocessing UV spectrum has been calculated by Haardt & Madau (1996). We use an\nionizing background model including QSOs and galaxies with 10% ionizing photons escape\nfraction (kindly provided by F. Haardt). At z = 2.5, such an ionizing background produces\nthe transmission flux of H I and He II similar to observation and an average \u03b7 \u2243 72, which\nis very close to observed value.\nThe atomic processes in the plasma of hydrogen and helium of primordial composition,\nincluding ionization, radiative cooling and heating, and the fraction of H I and He II are\ncalculated in the same way as Theuns et al. (1998). That is, under the \"optically thin\"\napproximation, once density and temperature of baryon gas are given, the ionizing state of\nH and He is directly determined from the ionization-equilibrium equation.\n\n3.2.\n\nSamples of Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux\n\nFor given sample of the fields of density, temperature and velocity of the baryon matter,\nthe optical depth of H I or He II can be produced by a convolution with Voigt profile as\nfollows (Bi et al. 1995; Zhang et al. 1997)\nZ\n1\n\u03b4z\nv(x)\n\u03c4i (z) = \u03c3i c dxni (x) \u221a\nV[ T\n+ T , bTi ]\n(1)\nT\n\u03c0H(z)bi\nbi (1 + z)\nbi\nwhere i =H I or He II, \u03c3i is the absorption cross section of Ly\u03b1 line, ni (x) the number\ndensity, \u03b4z is the redshift difference between z and x, v(x) the peculiar velocity in unit\nc and bTi = (2kT /mi c2 )1/2 the thermal velocity. V is the Voigt profile, which is normalR\n\u221a\n\u03b4z\nized dx(1/ \u03c0b)V [ b(1+z)\n+ v(x)\n, b] = 1. The Hubble constant at redshift z is H(z) =\nb\np\nH0 \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b . Eq.(1) shows, when the terms of thermal broadening and peculiar\nvelocity are not negligible, the Ly\u03b1 transmission flux depends on mass density field nHI , nHeII\nas well as the fields of temperature and velocity of IGM.\nWe produced 100 mock samples of H I and He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux at z = 2.5 with\nrandomly selected lines of sight. Each mock spectrum is sampled using 210 pixels with the\nsame spectral resolution as the observation. As the corresponding comoving scale for 210\npixels is larger than the simulation box size, we replicate the sample periodically. We add\nGaussian noise to H I sample with signal-to-noise ratio, S/N=50, while He II with S/N=3.\nFigure 1 shows typical samples of H I and He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux fields.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n4.\n\nLine width of He II and H I Ly\u03b1 absorptions\n\nTo demonstrate the importance of the velocity field, we consider the line widths of Ly\u03b1\nabsorption. If the Ly\u03b1 absorption lines are purely thermal broadened, the line width, or\nDoppler parameter, b(He II) of He II should be less than b(H I) by a factor of 2. However,\nZheng et al. (2004) found b(He II)= \u03beb(H I) and \u03be \u2243 1. They concluded that the velocity\nfield in IGM is dominated by turbulence.\nThis result can be explained with considering the velocity field in eq.(1). A flux field\ngiven by eq.(1) generally is not given by a superposition of lines with Gaussian profile,\nbecause the peculiar velocity v(x) is a random field. Therefore, the line width given by\nGaussian profile fitting is not always equal to the thermal broadening bT . For instance,\nwhen bTi is small, the Voigt profile will picks up only pixels with \u03b4z + (1 + z)v(x) \u2243 0. In this\ncase, the line width can be estimated by (1 + z)h(\u2206v)2 i1/2 , i.e. the line width is dominated\nby the variance of the velocity field, which is the same for He II and H I. This is turbulent\nbroadening. It has been shown recently that the velocity field v(x) shows the feature of a\nfully developed turbulence (He et al. 2006).\nTo test this point, we identify the absorption lines by the similar way as that for the\nreal sample. We use AUTOVP code (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1997) to decompose the transmitted flux\nwith Gaussian profile, and estimate the parameters of line width, column density, and the\ncentroid wavelength of each line. Figure 2 shows b(H I) vs. b(He II) for both real data and\nsimulation samples. The real data are taken from Zheng et al. (2004). Obviously, the plot\nof b(H I) vs. b(He II) from simulated data does not follow the thermal broadening relation\nb(H I) = 2b(He II), but similar to the turbulent broadening.\n\n5.\n\nThe ratio between He II and H I Ly\u03b1 optical depths\n5.1.\n\nThe scatter of optical depth ratio\n\nIf the Voigt profile can be approximated by a Dirac delta function, eq.(1) yields\n\u03c4HeII (z)\n1 nHeII (z)\n=\n,\n\u03c4HI (z)\n4 nHI (z)\n\n(2)\n\nIf atoms and ions of H I, H II, He I, He II and He III are in state of photoionization\nequilibrium, the ratio of He II to H I is (Fardal et al. 1998)\nJHI 3 + \u03b14\nnHeII (z)\n\u2243 1.70\nnHI (z)\nJHeII 3 + \u03b11\n\n\u0012\n\nT (z)\n104.3\n\n\u00130.06\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhere we assume that the UV radiation backgrounds around wavelengths wavelength c/\u03bdHI =\n912\u00c5 and c/\u03bdHeII = 228 \u00c5 are, respectively, J\u03bd = JHI (\u03bd/\u03bdHI )\u2212\u03b11 and J\u03bd = JHeII (\u03bd/\u03bdHeII )\u2212\u03b14 ,\nthe parameters JHI and JHeII being the specific intensities, \u03b11 and \u03b14 the index of their power\nlaws.\nIf the UV radiation background is spatially uniform, i.e. the parameters JHI , JHeII , \u03b11\nand \u03b14 are constant, the ratio nHeII (z)/nHI (z) of eq.(3) is approximately spatially constant,\nbecause the temperature-dependence (T 0.06 ) is very weak. Thus, from eqs.(2) and (3) we\nmay expect that the ratio of optical depths \u03c4HeII (z)/\u03c4HI (z) should basically be constant, i.e.\nthe scatter of ratio \u03c4HeII (z)/\u03c4HI (z) with respect to its mean h\u03c4HeII (z)/\u03c4HI (z)i has to be very\nsmall.\nThus, the observed \u03b7 scatter (Kriss et al. 2001; Smette et al. 2002; Zheng et al. 2004;\nShull et al. 2004) may indicate that the ratios, JHI /JHeII and (3 + \u03b14 )/(3 + \u03b11 ) are not\nconstant, but significantly different from pixel to pixel, or from line to line. However, eq.(2)\nis based on the assumption that the effects of thermal broadening and peculiar velocities are\nignored. As has been shown in last section, the effects of thermal broadening and peculiar\nvelocities may not be always small. Therefore, we should estimate the \u03b7-scatter caused by\nthermal broadening and peculiar velocities.\nSince the assumption of eq.(2) is not hold, we use \u03b7 to stand only for 4\u03c4HeII /\u03c4HI (z) below.\nFigure 3 illustrates the effect of thermal broadening and a peculiar velocity field. It shows 1.)\ntop panel: the 1-D distributions of the ratio \u03b7 of optical depths given by eq.(1), 2.) second\npanel: \u03b7 distribution from optical depths of eq.(1), but using a delta function for the Voigt\nprofile; 3.) third panel: \u03b7 given by optical depths of eq.(1) and adding, respectively, S/N=3\nand S/N=50 noises to the He II and H I transmitted flux; 4.) forth panel: temperature T\ndistribution; 5.) bottom panel: mass density field of baryon matter.\nFrom the panel 2 of Fig. 3 one can see clearly that if the effect of thermal broadening\nis ignored, i.e. the Voigt profile is approximated by a Dirac delta function, \u03b7 is almost\na constant in the whole range. In this approximation, the ratio \u03b7 does not depend on the\nfluctuations of temperature, mass density and velocity of baryon gas, but only on the density\nratio nHII /nHI . The ratio nHII /nHI , however, always keeps constant, even when nHII and nHI\nfluctuate strongly. The \u03b7 distribution shown in panel 2 contains a significant sharp decline\nat the highest temperature region. It probably results from dielectronic recombination of\nHe II that is dominant at such high temperatures, and reduces the number nHeII . At less\nhigh temperatures, the collision ionization rate of H I is higher than He II, accordingly, there\nappear some small bumps as those visualized in panel 2.\nHowever, the top panel shows that, when thermal broadening is included, the fluctu-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nations of \u03b7 are higher at the positions with higher temperature and higher density. These\nfluctuations are due partially to the difference between the thermal velocities of He II and\nH I. It leads to the distribution of H I to be more extended than He II. The hydrodynamical\nvelocity field v(x) is the same for He II and H I. It doesn't cause the change of the ratio\nnHII /nHI . The effect of thermal broadening on \u03b7 scatter has also been noted by Croft et al.\n(1997), but in their samples the scatter caused by thermal broadening is not very significant.\nIt is probably because more shocks are resolved on small scales in the WIGEON simulations,\nwhich leads to stronger temperature fluctuations (He et al. 2004). The panel 3 of Fig. 3\nshows more significant scatter of \u03b7 if the noise is added. From Figure 1, we have seen that\nthe transmitted flux of He II is substantially affected by the S/N=3 noise.\n\n5.2.\n\nPDF of \u03b7\n\nWe now examine the probability distribution function (PDF) of \u03b7, which is calculated\npixel by pixel as Shull et al. (2004). Figure 4 shows the PDFs for 1.) real data; 2.) simulation\nsample of the transmitted flux from eq.(1); 3.) simulation samples of the transmitted flux\nfrom eq.(1), and adding, respectively, S/N=3 and S/N=50 noise to the He II and H I\ntransmitted flux, and 4.) simulated samples without thermal broadening, but adding noise.\nThe simulation PDFs are calculated with 100 samples of 1-D transmitted flux of He II and\nH I. The error bars are the maximum and minimum from 100 independent noise realizations.\nThe simulation data are also binned into 0.05\u00c5 to match observation.\nWe see that the PDF of the simulated data without adding noise has the peak at\nlog \u03b7 \u2243 1.9 which is about the same as real data (Zheng et al. 2004; Shull et al. 2004).\nHowever, the width of PDF of the simulated data without adding noise is much less than\nthe real data. The maximum scatter of \u03b7 of the simulated data is about 2h\u03b7i. The factor 2\nis just the difference between the thermal velocities of H I and He II. Though there are some\npixels with \u03b7 > 2h\u03b7i caused by collision ionization, it is still less than the observed scatter.\nThe PDF of simulation data is significantly improved with adding noise. It looks similar\nto the observed result. The PDF of simulation data has the same peak as real data, and\nthe width of PDF is also about the same as real one. Therefore, the effect of data noise is\nsubstantial for the scatter of \u03b7. This effect is especially serious on the high \u03b7 events. Samples\nwithout noise contamination do not have events of \u03b7 > 300, but the samples with noise do.\nThis result is about the same as Shull et al. (2004), in which events of \u03b7 > 460 are dropped,\nbecause they may largely be from the uncertainty in measuring.\nNevertheless, we see that the PDF of simulation sample with noise is still lower than\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe real data in the range \u03b7 < 10. This result is also similar to Shull et al. (2004). They\nfound that the events of \u03b7 < 10 of real data show an factor 2 excess to a Monte Carlo\ncalculation. Figure 4 also shows that the number of \u03b7 < 10 of real data is about twice as\nlarge as simulation sample. However, Shull et al. (2004) found that the events of \u03b7 < 30\nof real data are also more than their Monte Carlo estimation by a factor 2, while Figure 3\ndoesn't show so large difference. This is probably because our simulation contains the effect\nof thermal broadening and peculiar velocity field. This point can be seen from the PDF of\n\u03b7 for simulation samples without thermal broadening, but adding noise (the filled dots in\nFigure 4). It shows there are more low-\u03b7 events without thermal broadening. In a word, our\nsimulation result indicates the excess of low-\u03b7 events in real data, but the difference between\nreal and simulation data is less than the Monte Carlo estimation.\nThe effect of noise can also be seen in Figure 5, which presents the relation between \u03b7\nand \u03c4HI in the range \u03c4HI > 0.01. The top panel is from real data. The middle is given by\nsimulation samples with adding noise of S/N=3 to He II and S/N=50 to H I. The bottom\nshows simulation samples without noise. The \u03b7-\u03c4HI distribution of simulation sample with\nnoise is similar to the real one. The high-\u03b7 events at low \u03c4HI area are mainly from noise.\nThis is consistent with the observed result that \u03b7 is large in void area \u03c4HI < 0.05 (Shull et\nal. 2004).\nFigure 6 presents the relation between \u03b7 and column density N(HI) for real data and\nsimulation samples with noise. It shows the correlation between \u03b7 and density of H I: \u03b7 is\nlarger for lower column density N(HI), and lower for higher N(HI). This phenomenon is\nalso shown in the He II spectrum of HS1700+6416 (Reimers et al. 2005).\n\n6.\n\nPower spectrum\n\nWe now compare the power spectra of H and He transmitted flux of simulation sample\nand real data. We calculate the power spectrum by the same method as Paper I. It gives\neasy to compare the power spectra of H and He. Moreover, the real data of He is highly\nnoisy, for some pixels, the S/N ratio is lower than 1, and some pixels with negative flux.\nTo eliminate the effect of these pixels on the power spectrum calculation, we should use the\nalgorithm of denoising or conditional-counting as Paper I (Donoho 1995; Jamkhedkar et al.\n2001).\nThe power spectra of H I and He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux of HE2347 are shown in Figure\n7. We plot the power spectrum of H I in top panel as an indicator of the goodness of the\nsimulation sample of this paper, which is produced in a box with size larger than that of\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nPaper I by a factor of 4. The parameters f = 1 and f = 3 mean, respectively, the threshold\ncondition for denoising to be S/N > 1, and 3. Since the real data of H I Ly\u03b1 transmitted\nflux has high quality, the power spectrum actually is f -independent if f > 1 (Jamkhedkar\net al. 2005). On the other hand, there are very rare pixels of the He II data with S/N > 3,\nand therefore, only a very small number of the modes is available if taking f > 3. One can\nonly use f = 1 to calculate He II power spectrum of He2347. The error bars of Figure 7 is\nestimated by the maximum and minimum range of bootstrap re-sampling.\nAs expected, the simulation sample of H I transmission flux is in well agreement with\nobservations on all scales less than \u03b4v = 224 km s\u22121 . There is no discrepancy on the smallest\nscale \u03b4v = 28 km s\u22121 or length scale D = 0.28 h\u22121 Mpc. This result is the same as Paper\nI, and therefore, the power spectrum on small scales is insensitive to the size of simulation\nbox.\nThe power spectrum of the He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux of HE2347, as shown in the\nbottom panel of Figure 7, is very different from simulation samples without adding noise on\nscales less than 56 km s\u22121 . On those scales, the power spectrum of observed sample is much\nhigher than the simulation results. However, the power spectrum of the noisy samples of\nHe II flux gives a good fitting to the observed sample. In other words, if we could remove the\nS/N=3 noise from the real data, the power spectrum can be well fitted with the simulation\nof the LCDM model. Thus, with He II flux, we can arrive at the same conclusion as H I:\nthere is no evidence for the discrepancy between observation and simulation on scales from\n1792 to 28 km s\u22121 , or from 0.28 to 18 h\u22121 Mpc.\n\n7.\n\nDiscussions and conclusions\n\nThe H I and He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux fluctuations of QSO absorption spectrum are\nvaluable to detect the fields of baryon gas and ionizing photon field, and to constrain models\nof the UV radiation background. With hydrodynamic simulation samples of the \u039bCDM\nmodel, we made a comparison between the model-predicted statistical features and real data\nof HE2347. It includes the power spectrum, the line width of absorption features, and the\nratio between the He II and H I optical depths. The major conclusions are as follows:\n1.) The absorption features of He II and H I basically are turbulent-broadening. It\nshould be emphasized that the observed evidence for the turbulent-broadening mainly is\ngiven by the absorption lines in voids (Zheng et al. 2004). This is especially supported by\nthe simulation samples, which shows that the turbulence behavior of the velocity field of\nIGM is on high as well as low mass density area (Kim et al. 2005).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n2.) The mean of the optical depth ratio h\u03b7i of real sample can be well fitted with\nsimulation samples.\n3.) The simulation samples give a very well fitting to the power spectra of both H I and\nHe II transmitted flux. There is no discrepancy between the power spectra of simulated and\nobserved samples on small scales. For H sample, the scales are till to 0.28 h\u22121 Mpc. For He,\nit is 1.1 h\u22121 Mpc. Therefore, there is no evidence that the power of observed sample is less\nthan the standard \u039bCDM model on small scales.\n4.) The last but not the least is on the \u03b7-scatter. The large \u03b7 scatter are generally\nattributed to the inhomogeneity of the UV photon distributions. We showed, however, that\na significant part of the \u03b7-scatter is from the fluctuations of the temperature and velocity\nfields of IGM and data noise. There seems to be a discrepancy on low-\u03b7 events comparing\nour simulation and the real data. The simulation sample does not contain enough low-\u03b7\nevents to fit real data. To solve this problem models of producing extra fluctuations on Ly\u03b1\ntransmitted flux on scales of about 1 h\u22121 Mpc is needed.\nThe WIGEON samples are produced with a uniformly distributed UV radiation background, and therefore, we may consider an inhomogeneous UV radiation background to be\na possible reason of the lack of low-\u03b7 events. However, the numerical results of the inhomogeneous UV radiation background shows that the fluctuations of UV radiation background\non small scales will yield more high-\u03b7 events (200 < \u03b7 < 350). Therefore, at least, according\nto the current calculation, the model of the UV background inhomogeneity would not be\nhelpful to solve the problem of the lack of low-\u03b7 events.\nNote that low-\u03b7 events are related to high column density N(HI). The lack of low-\u03b7\nevents may be due to that the WIGEON samples are produced without considering the\ndetailed physical processes of ionizing sources, as some mechanical and radiation feedback\neffects would not be negligible in the area of high column density, which has the high probability containing collapsed objects.\nAny model of producing the scatter of \u03b7 will affect the transmitted flux of both H I and\nHe II. Therefore, we can use our unified fitting of H I and He II Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux to set\nsome constraints on models for low-\u03b7 events.\nFirst, if the fluctuations are Gaussian, it will play the same role as Gaussian noise, and\nincrease the power of transmitted flux on scale \u2243 1 Mpc. However, this paper and Paper\nI show that the power spectrum of H I Ly\u03b1 transmitted flux is in good consistent with\nobservation on scale 1 h\u22121 Mpc and less. Therefore, any increase of the power of simulation\nsample will no longer be consistent with observed sample. Therefore, there is small room for\nmodels of adding Gaussian fluctuation.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nSecond, if the fluctuations are non-Gaussian, it should be limited by the observed nonGaussian features of the H I and He II flux. The non-Gaussian statistical features of H I\ntransmitted flux, such as high order moments of the fluctuations of the flux, are sensitive\nto the addition of non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. It has been shown in Paper I that the nonGaussian features of the H I transmitted flux of HE2347 can already be well fitted with the\nWIGEON samples to eight order and on scale as small as 0.28 h\u22121 Mpc. Therefore, there is\nalso small room for models of adding non-Gaussian fluctuations.\nJRL thanks Francesco Haardt for kindly providing us ionizing background model, Romeel\nDav\u00e9 for making AUTOVP publicly available and Hy Trac for help from his MACH code.
