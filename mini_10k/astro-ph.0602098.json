The\ncontent of the theorem is the assertion that the actual pressure Pc at the center of a star\nwith a mass M in the hydrostatic equilibrium must be intermediate between those at the\ncenters of the two configurations of uniform density, one at a density equal to the mean\ndensity \u03c1 of the star, and the other at a density equal to the density \u03c1c at the center; i.e.,\nPc must satisfy the inequality,\n1 \uf8eb 4\u03c0 \uf8f6\nG\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n2 \uf8ed 3 \uf8f8\n\n1/ 3\n\n1 \uf8eb 4\u03c0 \uf8f6\n\u03c1 4 / 3 M 2 / 3 \u2264 Pc \u2264 G\uf8ec \uf8f7\n2 \uf8ed 3 \uf8f8\n\n1/ 3\n\n\u03c1 c4 / 3 M 2 / 3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nBased on the right hand side of this inequality (1), the maximum radiation pressure at\nthe center of a star of a given mass, (1- \u03b2 * ), was determined as the equilibrium and the\nstability condition for a star of a given mass. It is given with the mass M of the star and\nthe mean molecular weight \u03bc by the equation (Chandrasekhar,1984),\n\uf8eb1\u2212 \u03b2 * \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\u03bc M = 5.48 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u03b2\n*\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2\n\nwhere M\n\n1/ 2\n\nM\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nis the mass of the sun. From Eq.(1) it follows that for a star of solar mass\n\nwith the mean molecular weight equal to 1, the radiation pressure at the center cannot\nexceed 3% of the total pressure, or the star will be unstable. As explained in the paper\n(Chandrasekhar,1984), such a result follows naturally from the kinetic theory in the\nMaxwellian sense, where the matter is assumed to satisfy the equation of state of an\nideal gas.\nOn the other hand, a lot of recent studies on the statistical description for various\nphysical systems, particularly for the systems endowed with long-range interactions,\nrevealed that some extension of B-G statistical approach should be needed. Recently,\nthe statistical mechanics based on the Tsallis nonextensive entropy has been developed\nas a very useful tool to describe the complex systems whose properties often cannot be\nexactly described by Boltzmann-Gibbs (B-G) statistical mechanics (Gell-Mann and\n\n2\n\n\fTsallis, 2004; Abe and Okamoto, 2001). This new statistical theory has been applied\nextensively to deal with varieties of interesting problems in the field of astrophysics\nwhere the systems are known to need the nonextensive statistical description due to the\nlong-range nature of gravitational interactions (e.g., Lima, et al, 2002; Silva and Lima,\n2005; Taruya and Sakagami, 2005, 2003; Leubner, 2004, 2005; Du, 2004a, 2004c, 2005;\nHansen, et al, 2005). The Tsallis entropy is given (Tsallis, 1988) by\nSq =\n\nk \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec \u2211 piq \u2212 1\uf8f7 ,\n1\u2212 q \uf8ed i\n\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, pi is the probability that the system under\nconsideration is in its ith configuration, q is a positive parameter whose deviation from\nunity is considered as describing the degree of nonextensivity of the system. In other\nwords, (1-q) is a measure of the lack of extensivity of the system. The celebrated\nBoltzmann entropy is recovered from Sq in the limit q \u2192 1. By using Eq.(3), if the\nsystem is composed of two subsystems numbered 1 and 2, then the total Tsallis entropy\nof the system is S q (1 \u2295 2) = S q (1) + S q (2) + (1 \u2212 q ) S q (1) S q (2) / k . The extensivity is\nobtained when we take q =1.\nAlmost all the systems treated in statistical mechanics with B-G statistical\nmechanics have usually been extensive; this property holds for systems with short-range\ninterparticle forces. When we deal with systems with long-rang interparticle forces such\nas Newtonian gravitational forces and Coulomb electric forces, where nonextensivity\nholds, B-G statistics may need to be generalized for the statistical description of such\nsystems.\nIn this paper, we will revisit the idea of Chandrasekhar's condition of the\nequilibrium and stability for a star in the nonextensive kinetic theory based on Tsallis\nentropy, analyzing the effects of nonextensivity on the Chandrasekhar's condition and\nquantifying the role of nonextensivity in the equilibrium and stability of a star.\n2. The nonextensive kinetic theory\nThe nonextensivity in the Chandrasekhar's condition Eq.(1) can be introduced\n3\n\n\fthrough the equation of state of the ideal gas. In the nonextensive kinetic theory based\non the Tsallis entropy, when we consider a self-gravitating system with particles\ninteracting via the gravitational potential, the nonextensive velocity distribution\nfunction is given through the q-generalization of Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B)\ndistribution (Silva, et al,1998; Lima, et al, 2001; Du, 2004a, 2004d) by\n1\n\n3\n2\n\nm v 2 \uf8f9 1\u2212q\n\uf8eb m \uf8f6 \uf8ee\nf q (r, v ) = nBq \uf8ec\n1\n(\n1\nq\n)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\uf8f7 \uf8ef\n\uf8fa ,\n2kT \uf8fb\n\uf8ed 2\u03c0kT \uf8f8 \uf8f0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere m is the mass of each particle, T is the temperature, n is the particle number\ndensity, Bq is the q-dependent normalized constant. The standard M-B distribution is\nrecovered from Eq.(4) if we take q =1. This distribution has been applied to some\ninteresting problems in astrophysics, such as the Jeans instability (Lima et al, 2002; Du,\n2004b), the plasma oscillations (Lima et al, 2000), the negative heat capacity (Silva and\nAlcaniz, 2003), the solar wind intermittency (Leubner and Voros, 2004) and the dark\nmatter (Hansen, et al, 2005; Leubner, 2005) etc.\nWe consider a cloud of ideal gas within the non-relativistic gravitational context. If\nn denotes the particle number density, in the view of kinetic theory, pressure of the gas\nis defined by Pg = 13 nm < v 2 > with < v 2 > the mean square velocity of the particle.\nWhen the nonextensive effect on the gas is considered in Tsallis statistics, it is\nintroduced through a new expectation value of square velocity defined (Tsallis, et al,\n1998) by\n\n\u222b v [ f (r, v)] d v\n=\n\u222b [ f (r, v)] d v\nq\n\n2\n\n< v >q\n2\n\n3\n\nq\n\nq\n\n(5)\n\n3\n\nq\n\nThe gas is now considered in the generalized M-B sense with the velocity distribution\nfunction Eq.(4). In this way, the q expectation value (5) for the square velocity of the\nparticle is derived (Du, 2004b, Silva and Alcaniz, 2003) as\n< v2 >q =\n\n6 kT\n,\n5 \u2212 3q m\n\n(0< q <\n\n5\n).\n3\n\n(6)\n\nIt is clear that, as expected, the standard mean square velocity < v 2 >= 3kT / m is\n\n4\n\n\fcorrectly recovered from the above equation if we take q \u2192 1 . From Eq.(6) we can\ndirectly obtain the equation of state of an ideal gas in the nonextensive kinetic theory,\n1\n2\nPg = nm < v 2 > q =\nnkT\n3\n5 \u2212 3q\n\n(7)\n\nEq.(7) may be written as the form familiar to astrophysics. Taking into account the\nparticle mass m = \u03bc mH and the particle number density n = \u03c1 / \u03bc mH , where \u03bc is the\nmean molecular weight and m H is the mass of the hydrogen atom, we have\nPg =\n\n2\nk\n\u03c1T\n5 \u2212 3q \u03bc mH\n\n(8)\n\nThe standard equation of state of an ideal gas is recovered perfectly from the above\nequations at the limit q \u2192 1 .\n3. The Chandrasekhar's condition\nTo gain a clear idea of effects of nonextensivity on the Chandrasekhar's condition,\nquantifying the role of nonextensivity in the equilibrium of a star, we consider Eq.(8) as\nthe gas pressure, while the effect of nonextensivity on the Planck radiation law may be\nneglected. As usual, if the gas pressure contributes a fraction \u03b2 to the total pressure,\nusing Eq.(8) and the radiation pressure, Pr = aT 4 / 3 , where a denotes the Stefan's\nconstant, we may write the total pressure as\nP=\n\n1\n\n2\nk\n1 1 4\n\u03c1T =\naT ,\n\u03b2 5 \u2212 3q \u03bc m H\n1\u2212 \u03b2 3\n\n(9)\n\nNow, following the Chandrasekhar's line, from Eq.(9) we can derive the temperature,\n1\n3\n\n\uf8ee k 3 2 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \uf8f9 13\nT =\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \u03c1 ,\n\uf8f0 \u03bc m H a 5 \u2212 3q \u03b2 \uf8fb\n\n(10)\n\nSubstituting back to Eq.(9) and eliminating the temperature T, we may express P in\nterms of \u03c1, \u03b2 and q by\n\n5\n\n\f1\n\n4\n\n\uf8ee k 4 3 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \uf8f9 3 \uf8eb 2 \uf8f6 3 43\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u03c1 ,\nP = \uf8ef(\n)\n4 \uf8fa \uf8ec\n\uf8f0 \u03bc m H a \u03b2 \uf8fb \uf8ed 5 \u2212 3q \uf8f8\n\n(11)\n\nTo bring out explicitly the role of the nonextensivity in the equilibrium of a star, we\ncombine the right-hand side of the inequality (1) with P given by Eq.(11) to yield, for\nthe stable existence of stars, the condition,\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb 2 \uf8f6 \uf8eb 6 \uf8f6 2 \u2212 32 \uf8eb k\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 G \uf8ec\uf8ec\nM \u2265 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 5 \u2212 3q \uf8f8 \uf8ed \u03c0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u03bc mH\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb 3 1\u2212 \u03b2c\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n4\n\uf8ed\u03b1 \u03b2c\n\n1\n\n\uf8f62\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b2c is the value of \u03b2 at the center. Then, replacing the Stefan's constant with\n\n\u03b1 = 8\u03c05 k4/15h3 c3, we have\n\uf8eb 5 \u2212 3q \uf8f6\n\u03bc M\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 2 \uf8f8\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \u03b2\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed1\u2212 \u03b2c\n4\nc\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n\uf8f6\nhc 2 1\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2265 0.1873 \uf8eb\uf8ec \uf8f6\uf8f7\n2\n\uf8ed G \uf8f8 mH\n\uf8f8\n\n(13)\n\nOn the right hand side of this inequality, the combination of nature constants can be\ngiven in units of the mass of the sun (Chandrasekhar, 1984), i.e., ( hc/G )3/2 / m H2 \u2248 29.2\nM . Thus, the condition (13) becomes\n\uf8eb 5 \u2212 3q \uf8f6\n\u03bc 2M \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 2 \uf8f8\n\n2\n\n\uf8eb \u03b2 c4\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed1\u2212 \u03b2c\n\n1\n\n\uf8f62\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2265 5.48 M\n\uf8f8\n\n(14)\n\nWe may also obtain from this inequality an upper limit to (1\u2212\u03b2c) for a star of a given\nmass so that\n1\u2212\u03b2c \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b2 ** ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the value of (1\u2212 \u03b2 ** ) is determined, but now related to the nonextensive\nparameter q, by the equation,\n2\n\n\uf8eb 1 \u2212 \u03b2 ** \uf8f6\n\uf8eb 5 \u2212 3q \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\u03bc M \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 = 5.48 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 2 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u03b2 ** \uf8f8\n2\n\n1/ 2\n\nM\n\n(16)\n\nThus the Chandrasekhar's condition Eq.(2) is generalized by Eq.(16) in the new kinetic\ntheory when the nonextensivity is taken into consideration. As compared with Eq.(2) we\nfind that\n(a)1\u2212 \u03b2 ** >1\u2212 \u03b2 * if 0< q <1;\n6\n\n\f(b) 1\u2212 \u03b2 ** <1\u2212 \u03b2 * if 1< q <5/3;\n(c) 1\u2212 \u03b2 ** =1\u2212 \u03b2 * if q =1.\n\n(17)\n\n4.Conclusion and discussion\nFrom the above results we conclude that the maximum radiation pressure\n(1\u2212 \u03b2 ** ) allowed at the center of a star of a given mass is now dependent not only on its\nmass but also on its nonextensive parameter q. For example, if a star of solar mass is\nwith the mean molecular weight equal to 1, the radiation pressure at the center can\nexceed 3% of the total pressure if q<1, for which the star was believed to be unstable\nwhile now may be still stable; on the contrary, the radiation pressure at the center may\nbe less than 3% of the total pressure if q >1, for which the star was believed to be stable\nwhile now may become unstable. It is clear that Chandrasekhar's condition, Eq.(2), is\nrecovered from Eq.(16) when in the case of q=1.\nIt is noticeable that how to understand the physical meaning of the nonextensive\nparameter q plays a very important role in the applications of Tsallis statistics to the\nfields of astrophysics. However, in the light of present understanding, it is still an open\nproblem. With the standard B-G statistics, the structure and stability of self-gravitating\nsystems at statistical equilibrium are usually analyzed in terms of the maximization of a\nthermodynamic potential (the so-called mean field description). This thermodynamic\napproach leads to isothermal configurations (for example, self-gravitating isothermal\ngas spheres) that have been studied for long time in the stellar structure\n(Chandrasekhar,1942). It is well known that the stellar self-gravitating gases are usually\nin the hydrostatic equilibrium but not in the thermal equilibrium. The isothermal\nconfigurations only correspond to meta-stable states (locally convective mixing), not\ntrue equilibrium states. When the nonextensive effect is considered in the framework of\nTsallis statistics, the equation of state of an idea gas can be written as Pq = nkTq with\nthe physical temperature Tq a variable (Abe, et al, 2001) that depends on the\nnonextensive parameter q. Comparing this equation with Eq.(7), we find\n7\n\n\fTq = 2T /(5 \u2212 3q ) . In this way, we agree with the explanation for q of self-gravitating\ngases, i.e., q = 1 represents an isothermal process of the gas, but q \u2260 1 is corresponding\nto the non-isothermal one. For this point, we may introduce a relation between the\nnonextensive parameter q, the temperature gradient \u2207T\n\nand the gravitational\n\nacceleration \u2207\u03c6 that has been determined recently (Du, 2004a, 2004d) by\nk\u2207T + (1 \u2212 q )m\u2207\u03c6 = 0\n\n(18)\n\nThis relation provides an physical interpretation for q\n\n1. q is not unity if and only if\n\n\u2207T is not equal to zero, i.e., the nonextensivity is closely related to the nonequilibrium\ndegree of the system endowed with the long-range gravitating interactions. If applying\nEq.(18) to the interior of a star, under spherical symmetry, we find\n1\u2212 q = \u2212\n\nk dT\n\u03bc mH dr\n\nGM (r )\nr2\n\n(19)\n\nThere are still some interpretations for q in some works. For example (Silva and\nAlcaniz, 2004), q is related to the stellar polytrope index by n = 3/2 + 1/(q-1) depending\non the standard statistical averages or n =1/2+ 1/(1-q) depending on the normalized q\naverages. In the limit n \u2192 \u221e , one has q \u2192 1, corresponding to the isothermal\ndistribution in an idea gas.\nThe different speeds of sound predicted by the tow statistics will cause a possibility\nto find the experimental evidence for the nonextensive effect. As a means of probing the\ninterior structure and dynamics of a star with increasing precision, the helioseismology\nhas provided the information about the square speed of sound through stellar interiors\n(Gough, et al, 1996). With this seismic observation, in principle, one might find the\nastronomical or experimental evidences for a value of q different from unity (Du, 2006).\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the project of \"985\" Program of TJU of China for\nthe financial support.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\nAbe S., Martinez S., Pennini F., Plastino A., 2001.
