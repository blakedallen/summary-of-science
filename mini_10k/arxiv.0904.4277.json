We\nalso find that once we take into account the heavy oversampling of the VCV catalog in the Virgo\nregion, the lack of UHECR events from that region is not incompatible with UHECR having AGN\nsources.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory has reported[1, 2] a\ncorrelation between the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays, and the positions of galaxies in\nthe Veron-Cetty Veron \"Catalog of Quasars and Active\nGalactic Nuclei\" (12th Ed.)[3] (VCV). Using UHECR\ndata above 40 EeV through May 27, 2006 and VCV\ngalaxies out to z = 0.024, a prescription was established by scanning on UHECR energy threshold, maximum angular separation, and maximum VCV object\nredshift. Then, independent data taken after May 27,\n2006 was used to test this prescription with the same\nenergy threshold, maximum redshift and angular separation. When satisfied in mid-summer 2007, the prescription implied an a priori probability of less than 1%\nthat UHECR sources are distributed isotropically. Altogether, in the full dataset up to Aug. 31, 2007, there are\n27 UHECRs with energy above 57 EeV and 20 of them\nare within 3.2\u25e6 of VCV galaxies with z < 0.018 (about 75\nMpc). Restricting to |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 , where the VCV catalog\nis more complete, there are 22 UHECRs of which 19 are\ncorrelated.\nThe existence of a correlation between UHECRs and\nVCV galaxies clarifies the nature of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays by establishing that UHECRs are extragalactic\nin origin and that they have an energy-dependent horizon\nconsistent with the GZK prediction. However as stressed\nin refs.[1, 2], the observed correlation alone is insufficient\nto conclude that the sources of UHECRs are AGNs, because AGNs are clustered with galaxies and thus may\nonly be a tracer of the true sources. We show here that\nthe observed correlation is too strong to be explained\nmerely by AGNs being clustered along with other galaxies.\nThe VCV catalog is not complete, homogeneous, or\npure. We begin by quantifying these deficiencies, in section II, in order to understand the limitations of VCV\nfor establishing quantitative bounds on the contribution\n\nof AGNs to the population of UHECRs. Next, using the\nAuger scan method, we measure in section III the correlation between the published Auger UHECRs above 57\nEeV and the optically-identifiable AGNs in VCV, and\ncompare that to the correlation with the full VCV catalog. Finally, in section IV we answer the question of\nwhether the observed degree of correlation to VCV and\nits optically-identified AGNs can be explained just on\nthe basis of the fact that galaxies are clustered and AGNs\ntrace that clustering: we find that the correlation of VCV\nwith published Auger UHECRs above 57 EeV has less\nthan 1% chance of arising simply from VCV tracing the\ndistribution of all galaxies.\n\nII.\n\nVCV PURITY AND COMPLETENESS\n\nThe VCV catalog is a compilation of the AGN, BL Lac,\nand quasar candidates reported in the literature, with\nheterogeneous selection criteria and different amounts of\ntelescope time devoted to different targets. It is not complete, uniform or pure. Unfortunately, the required complete, uniform, pure and well-characterized AGN catalog\ndoes not exist at this time, so in order to understand the\nsignificance of correlations with this catalog, we need to\nquantify its incompleteness, impurity and non-uniformity\nof the VCV catalog.\nZaw, Farrar and Greene[4] (ZFG below) addressed the\npurity issue, with respect to optical AGN indicators, by\nexamining all (21) of the VCV galaxies with z \u2264 0.018\nwhich fall within 3.2\u25e6 of an Auger UHECR above 57\nEeV; this examination is extended here as reported below. ZFG determined that 14 of the 21 VCV galaxies\nwhich correlate with UHECRs are optically-identifiable\nAGNs. The remaining 7 show limited or no nuclear activity based on their optical spectra. However only about\nhalf of the AGNs found using X-ray or radio can be identified using the standard BPT optical criteria[5], so some\nof the 7 correlated VCV galaxies which are not optical\n\n\f2\nAGNs could have active nuclei nevertheless. Observations are in progress with the Chandra X-ray observatory\nto determine whether these galaxies show signs of AGN\nactivity.\nWe have extended the work of ZFG by examining the\nspectra of the VCV galaxies with z \u2264 0.024, out to 6\u25e6\nfrom each UHECR, to determine which are opticallyidentifiable AGNs. There are 66 such VCV galaxies. Of\nthese, 52 are AGNs by optical criteria[4]. Nineteen of 20\ngalaxies labeled S1 or S1.x (broad-line Seyfert) by VCV\nmeet the AGN criteria. This is not surprising since S1\nidentifications are much more secure than S2 (narrow-line\nSeyfert) and other identifications[4]. On the other hand,\nnone of the 4 galaxies labeled as H2 among the 66 VCV\ngalaxies examined meet optical AGN criteria. In sum, after galaxies identified as H2 regions are removed, about\n1/6 of the galaxies in VCV are not optically-identifiable\nAGNs; however some of these may have active nuclei\nwhich would have to be discovered in the radio or X-ray.\nHaving estimated the uncertainty in the purity of\nVCV, we next measure the uniformity of its coverage. To\ndo this we compare the surface density of the VCV catalog (with galaxies labeled as H2 removed), to that of a\ncomplete, volume-limited catalog of galaxies. 2MASS[6]\nimaged the whole sky in the near-infrared (J, H, and K\nbands) and the 2MASS extended source catalog contains\npositions and fluxes of all galaxies on the sky down to\na limiting K-band magnitude of 13.5[7]. This waveband\nprovides an excellent, unbiased measure of the distribution of matter in the Universe except where it is incomplete due to Galactic extinction. Recently, Huchra et\nal. have compiled redshifts for the K < 11.25 brightest\nof these galaxies. We use this 2MASS Redshift Survey\n(2MRS) catalog to compare with VCV.\nWe divide the sky into 192 equal area patches of\n\u2248 200 sq-degrees each, using HEALPix[8] (currently,\nhttp://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov) and find the number of VCV\nand 2MRS galaxies in each patch. The upper and middle panels of Fig. 1 show the surface densities of 2MRS\ngalaxies and of VCV galaxies in equatorial coordinates,\nfor z \u2264 0.018 on the left and z \u2264 0.024 on the right.\nThere are 417 (624) VCV and 5097 (6214) 2MRS galaxies in the respective samples with z \u2264 0.018 (\u2264 0.024),\nfor average VCV/2MRS ratios 0.08 (0.10). The paucity\nof both 2MRS and VCV galaxies near the Galactic center in particular and in the Galactic plane in general is\ndue to dust extinction in the Galaxy. The lower panels\nshow the ratio of the number of VCV to 2MRS, or dark\nblue (zero) if there are no VCV galaxies in the pixel.\nThe uncertainty in the ratio due to Poisson noise can be\nestimated from the number count maps provided in the\nupper panels.\nIt is apparent that relatively more AGN-like galaxies\nhave been identified in the northern hemisphere than in\nthe southern hemisphere, which is not surprising in view\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's sky coverage and the\ndedicated search by Ho et al [9] for very low-luminosity\nAGN in the northern hemisphere. In addition to this\n\nlarge scale difference between hemispheres, the plots in\nFig. 1 show that the pixel-to-pixel variation in AGN detection is very large. The VCV/2MRS ratio ranges from\nbetween 0% and 77% for z \u2264 0.018, and between 0% and\n91% for z \u2264 0.024. The VCV/2MRS ratio is \u2264 1% in 32%\n(22%) of the pixels, with \u223c90% of the patches having ratios below 30% for z < 0.018 and 20% in the deeper sample. This large degree of inhomogeneity in the AGN sampling of VCV means that even if AGNs (or another type\nof galaxy that is concentrated in VCV) are the sources of\nUHECRs, the distribution of UHECR arrival directions\ncannot be expected to mirror the distribution of VCV\ngalaxies. In particular, VCV is highly over-sampled in\nthe Virgo region, by a factor of \u223c 5 within a 10\u25e6 radius\nof the center of the Virgo Cluster for z \u2264 0.018 and \u223c 3\nfor z \u2264 0.024, so the absence of UHECR events from this\nregion is compatible with the UHECR-VCV correlation\nseen in other regions, within statistical fluctuations.\nFor correlation studies, it is important to limit the\nanalysis to regions in which the galaxy catalog is complete. As shown in Fig. 2, which plots the 2MRS\ngalaxies with z \u2264 0.018 versus b, Galactic extinction is\nan important effect for |b| . 10\u25e6 . At larger latitudes,\nvolume-selected subsamples of this catalog should provide a good map of the matter in the nearby universe.\nTherefore, we restrict our analyses below to |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 and\nz \u2264 0.024, where the 2MRS K=11.25 catalog contains\n11851 galaxies. We will work with two volume-limited\n2MRS catalogs, with z \u2264 0.018 and z \u2264 0.024; these\ncatalogs have MK \u2264 \u221223.2 and MK \u2264 \u221223.8, respectively. Altogether, there are 405 (606) VCV galaxies and\n4525 (5516) 2MRS galaxies in these volume-limited subcatalogs within these redshift limits and with |b| > 10\u25e6 .\nThus on average, there are about 0.09 (0.11) VCV galaxies for each 2MRS galaxy in the volume limited samples,\nwith |b| > 10\u25e6 and in the redshift ranges of interest.\nFig. 3, compares the density distribution of VCV\ngalaxies (with those labeled H2 by VCV removed and\n|b| \u2265 10\u25e6 ), to volume-limited and flux-limited samples\nof 2MRS galaxies out to z \u2264 0.024. The volume-limited\nsample is binned in equal volume and the flux-limited\nsample is binned in equal \u2206z, in order to have meaningful statistics in each bin. One sees that VCV is oversampled at low z in comparison to both the flux-limited\nor volume-limited 2MRS catalogs.\n\nIII.\n\nUHECR CORRELATIONS WITH VCV\n\nWe set the stage for our studies by reviewing the Auger\nscan analysis using the 27 published UHECR events and\nscanning over the maximum angular separation, \u03c8, and\nover the maximum redshift of the galaxies, imposing a\nGalactic latitude cut |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 . We scan on source distance and maximum angular separation, \u03c8, but not on\nenergy threshold, because lower energy UHECR events\nare not publicly available. There are 694 galaxies in the\nVCV catalog with z < 0.024 of which 674 have |b| > 10\u25e6 ,\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: HEALPix maps of the surface density distribution of 2MRS galaxies (top) and VCV galaxies (middle). The white\nlines are at b = \u00b110\u25e6 and the cross is at the Galactic center. The bottom panels show the ratio of VCV to 2MRS galaxies,\nfor z \u2264 0.018 (left) and z \u2264 0.024 (right), showing the large variation in completeness of VCV. The maps are in Equatorial\nCoordinates with RA=180\u25e6 at the center of the map, using the Mollwide projection. Each map has 192 equal area pixels. The\nVirgo cluster is centered on RA=187\u25e6 , Dec = 13\u25e6 .\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: Distribution of 2MRS galaxies within z < 0.018, as\na function of Galactic latitude.\n\nand our UHECR dataset consists of the 22 published\nAuger events above 57 EeV[2] with |b| > 10\u25e6 . We scan\nin steps of 0.1\u25e6 and \u2206z = 0.001. For each combination\nof zmax , and \u03c8, we determine p, the exposure-weighted\nprojection of disks of radius \u03c8 around each AGN in the\nsample, normalized to the total Auger exposure. From\nthe number of correlated UHECRs, kcorr , we compute the\nassociated probability measure P , which following Auger\nis the cumulative binomial probability to find kcorr correlated events out of NCR cosmic rays, given the exposureweighted fractional coverage p of AGNs. The minimum\nvalue of P in the scan analysis with VCV galaxies occurs for zmax = 0.018, and \u03c8 = 3.2\u25e6 . For these parameter values, 19 UHECRs correlate with AGNs and\nthe exposure-weighted fraction of sky covered by VCV\ngalaxies is p = 0.2343. This results in a value of the\nprobability measure of P = 7.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 .\nFollowing Auger[1, 2], the chance probability of the\ncorrelation is assessed by making many mock catalogs\nof UHECRs with 22 arrival directions chosen at random\naccording to the Auger exposure, and then performing\nthe same scan on \u03c8 and zmax . The resultant probability\nof finding as low or lower value of P by chance, for an\nisotropic source distribution, is (7.1 \u00b1 2.3) \u00d7 10\u22128 . (Note\nthat the values of various quantities quoted above are\nnot identical to the corresponding quantities in the Auger\nanalysis because of our restriction on |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 and the\nabsence of the scan on energy.)\nWe next estimate the effect on the UHECR-VCV correlation, of restricting to galaxies in VCV which are confirmed AGNs, quasars or BLLacs. The primary effect of\nremoving galaxies not so identified from the VCV catalog\ncomes from correcting the classifications of VCV galaxies\nclose to UHECRs; a secondary effect is that the cleaned\n\nsource catalog is sparser, reducing p.\nTo create a \"cleaned VCV\" catalog (cVCV) we begin\nby removing the 14 not-optically-confirmed-AGNs with\nz \u2264 0.024 within 6\u25e6 of the Auger UHECRs. Then, we\n\"statistically clean\" the remainder of the 628=694-66\nVCV galaxies with z \u2264 0.024 which are more than 6\u25e6\nfrom a UHECR as follows. We keep the 167 galaxies labeled S1.x and we remove all 66 galaxies labeled as H2.\nThat leaves 381 galaxies labeled S2, ?, or unlabeled, of\nwhich we select a fraction 33/42 at random, corresponding to the fraction of optically identified S2.x's in the\nsame categories in the 66 VCV galaxies within 6\u25e6 which\nwe examined individually. This leaves us with 533 galaxies. After requiring |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 , our final cVCV sample\ncontains a total of 516 galaxies. This procedure assumes\nthat the statistics of the classification errors in the 66\ngalaxies within 6\u25e6 of the Auger UHECRs are representative of the ensemble. While approximate, it gives quite an\naccurate indication of the correlation between opticallyconfirmed AGNs and UHECRs since it is exact for the\ngalaxies close enough to produce a correlation and only\nthe statistical properties of the remainder matter.\nRepeating the scan with this cleaned VCV catalog, we\nfind that the most significant signal arises for zmax =\n0.015 and \u03c8 = 4.8\u25e6 , for which 18 UHECRs are correlated, p = 0.2803, and P = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 . The probability\nof getting a P value this small or smaller if UHECRs were\nisotropic is (2.9 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22125 . The shaded histograms in\nFig. 4 show the distributions of P values over 106 different isotropic samples, for the VCV (upper panel) and\ncVCV (lower panel) cases. The values for the real VCV\nand cVCV correlation analyses are shown as vertical lines\nfor purpose of comparison. Thus the correlation between\nUHECRs and the cleaned VCV catalog is significantly\nstronger than for an isotropic source distribution, but\nless so than with the full VCV catalog.\n\nIV.\n\nDO VCV GALAXIES MERELY \"TRACE\"\nTHE SOURCES OF UHECRS?\n\nIn this section we test whether the correlation of the\nhighest energy UHECRs with VCV can result from VCV\ngalaxies being \"tracers\" of the true sources. AGNs are in\nfirst approximation a random subset of ordinary galaxies \u2013 indeed, all galaxies may undergo AGN phases as a\nresult of mergers with another galaxy which stimulates\naccretion. An important question is therefore whether\nthe 3.2\u25e6 correlation scale might just reflect the galaxy\nclustering scale, inducing a similar correlation between\nUHECRs and any random sample of galaxies of the same\nsize and redshift distribution as VCV.\nThe analysis we perform to answer this question is\nstraightforward: repeat the correlation scan analyses,\nbut with 2MRS galaxies substituting for VCV or cVCV\ngalaxies, and determine how often a correlation as strong\nas that observed is obtained. We create 1000 different\nsamples containing 674 (516) galaxies randomly chosen\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3: Distribution of 2MRS galaxies with |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 , in a volume-limited (top left) and a flux-limited (bottom left) sample to\nz \u2264 0.024.

The minimum P\nvalue using the VCV catalog is shown as a vertical line. The\nlower panel is the same but for the cleaned VCV catalog,\ncVCV.\n.\n\nfrom 2MRS galaxies1 , with the same z distribution as\nthe VCV (cVCV) sample. For each galaxy sample, we\nrepeat the same correlation analysis as described above,\nfor VCV (cVCV) galaxies, finding for each galaxy sample\nthe value of zmax and \u03c8 that minimizes the probability\nmeasure P . The open histograms in Fig. 4 show the resulting distributions of P values over the 1000 different\n2MRS samples, for the VCV (upper panel) and cVCV\n(lower panel) cases. The values for the real VCV and\ncVCV correlation analyses are shown as vertical lines for\npurpose of comparison.\nFig. 4 shows that \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 UHECRs correlate more strongly with 2MRS galaxies than they do\nwith the isotropic samples.

Only 0.7% of the trials with\n2MRS-based catalogs have as strong or stronger correlation\nthan with VCV (upper panel) but this increases to \u2248 5% for\ncVCV (lower panel).\n\nstronger than with 2MRS galaxies: not one of our 1000\nmock 2MRS samples has a P value smaller than that for\nVCV, and only one has a lower value than the P in the\ncorresponding 1000 cVCV trials.\nIt is known that galaxy clustering depends on the mass\nand luminosity of the sample. Therefore, we repeated the\nanalysis using the subsample with MK \u2264 \u221223.8, which\nis volume-limited out to z \u2264 0.024, instead of the 2MRS\nflux-limited sample. The results do not change significantly. The results of the mock catalog analyses are also\nessentially the same whether the mock catalogs are chosen to have the same number of galaxies as VCV (cVCV)\nin redshift bins of \u2206z = 0.002, or just the same total\nnumber with z \u2264 0.024.\nSince the interest in the correlation of UHECRs with\nVCV galaxies and the choice of 57 EeV cutoff resulted\nfrom the analysis of the pre-perscription events (those\ntaken prior to May 28, 2006), in order to assess the true\nunbiased significance of the correlation we must restrict\nto the post-prescription UHECR dataset (taken between\nMay 28, 2006 and Aug. 31, 2007) and repeat the analysis\ndescribed above with these 11 events only. The results\nare shown in Fig. 5. Scanning with the VCV galaxies,\nthe lowest value of P is for zmax = 0.014 and \u03c8max = 3.3\u25e6 .\n\n\f7\n\nWe measured the completeness of the Veron-Cetty\nVeron AGN catalog and find that it varies strongly as\na function of location on the sky and redshift. Thus\nthe VCV catalog cannot be used to determine the fraction of UHECRs that are produced by AGNs. Furthermore, efforts to test or refute the UHECR-AGN correlation by comparing the global distribution of UHECRs\nto that of VCV galaxies are not valid. A uniform and\nwell-characterized AGN catalog will be essential for that\npurpose.\nWe followed up on the study of Zaw et al[11], which\nfound that only 2/3 of the VCV galaxies within 3.2\u25e6 of\na UHECR are optically identifiable AGNs, by investigat-\n\ning whether there is a significant correlation when the\npossibly-not-AGNs are removed from the source catalog.\nWe find that the correlation is reduced but remains significant. It will be interesting to find out whether some of\nthe optically-not-identified-as-AGN galaxies in VCV do\nshow AGN activity in radio or X-ray, or whether another\ntype of source is needed in addition to AGNs.\nFinally and most importantly, we have introduced a\nsimple but effective way to determine whether the correlation observed between the highest energy cosmic rays\nand galaxies in the Veron-Cetty Veron AGN catalog may\nsimply result from the fact that AGNs are galaxies and\ngalaxies are clustered. If this were the source of the\nUHECR-VCV correlation, then repeatedly subsampling\na complete catalog of galaxies in the same redshift range\nto a similar density would regularly produce a comparable degree of correlation. Instead, we find that a correlation as strong as what is observed between the postprescription (May 28, 2006-Aug. 31, 2007) Auger UHECRs with |b| > 10\u25e6 and energy above 57 EeV, and galaxies in the VCV catalog, occurs in fewer than 1% of randomly drawn subsamples of either volume-limited or fluxlimited 2MRS galaxy catalogs. As expected, such subsamples of galaxies do typically have a stronger correlation with UHECRs than found for an isotropic source distribution, however the increase in the correlation is too\nsmall to explain the extent of the correlation observed\nwith VCV. Thus we conclude that either the degree of\ncorrelation between highest energy Auger UHECRs and\nVCV galaxies in the post-prescription events is a statistical fluke or some of these cosmic rays are in fact produced\nin VCV galaxies.\nWe acknowledge the essential role of the Pierre Auger\nCollaboration in this work, which is based on data obtained and published by the Pierre Auger Observatory.\nFurthermore, GRF and IZ acknowledge their membership in the Pierre Auger Collaboration and thank their\ncolleagues for their participation in and contribution to\nthis research.

Running the scan using\n106 mock isotropic catalogs and 103 2MRS realizations,\nthe chance probability of finding as low or lower a value\nof P from isotropic sources is (4.6 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 and from\n2MRS-distributed sources is 0.7%. The same analysis for\ncVCV gives zmax = 0.009, \u03c8max = 5.1\u25e6 ; 8 UHECRs are\ncorrelated, p = 0.1781, P = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and the chance\nprobability is (3.2\u00b10.1)\u00d710\u22123 and 5.3%, for isotropic and\n2MRS-subsampled sources. The correlation is weaker for\nboth VCV and cVCV with post-prescription UHECRs\nthan with the full UHECR dataset, but this is normal\ndue to the smaller number of events, and the fact that\nthe 57EeV cutoff was chosen to maximize the correlation\nwith pre-perscription events.\nThe analysis presented here shows that the observed\ncorrelation between published UHECRs and VCV galaxies has only a very small chance of arising from galaxy\nclustering alone, implying that at least some of the 22\nAuger UHECRs with E > 57 EeV and |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 are produced in galaxies in the VCV catalog with z \u2264 0.018.\nThis result is not in contradiction with the report[10] of\nfinding no excess correlation between UHECRs and VCV\ngalaxies compared to that arising from UHECR sources\nfollowing the distribution of matter, because the method\nused in [10] is intrinsically less sensitive than the present\none and has insufficient power to discriminate.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\f8\nK.
