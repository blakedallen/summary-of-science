Koschmieder\nCenter for Statistical Mechanics\nThe University of Texas at Austin, Austin TX 78712. USA\ne-mail: koschmieder@utexas.edu\n\nWe study the consequences which the presence of an electric charge e\u00b1 in the\npion \u03c0 \u00b1 and the muon \u03bc\u00b1 has for the rest mass of \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03bc\u00b1 . The addition of\nthe electric charges e\u00b1 to the massive neutral bodies of these particles does not\nincrease the energy in the rest mass of the pion and muon, but rather decreases\ntheir energy by the binding energy of the electric charge to the neutral bodies of\nthe pion and muon. The addition of a charge e\u00b1 to the neutral neutrino lattices of\nthe pion or muon changes the simple cubic lattices of the neutral particles to facecentered cubic lattices of the charged particles, which is essential for the stability\nof the particles.\n\nKey words: electron, muon, pion, particle masses, lattice theory.\n\nIntroduction\nThe electric charge e\u00b1 is bound to the neutral bodies which make up most\nof the pion and muon masses. The mass of the electron or positron is but\na very small part of the mass of \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 , m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) \u223c\n= 207 m(e\u00b1 ), m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n\u223c\n= 273 m(e\u00b1 ). It has to be explained how the electric charges e\u00b1 affect the\nmass of the pions and muons. We have described in [1] an explanation of the\nneutral bodies of the pions and muons as consisting of simple cubic lattices\nmade up by muon neutrinos, anti-muon neutrinos, electron neutrinos and\nanti-electron neutrinos and their oscillations. In Section 11 in [1] we have\nalso explained the rest mass of the electron or positron as consisting of an\n1\n\n\felectron neutrino or anti-electron neutrino lattice and of electric oscillations.\nThe accurately known ratios m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) seem to be\nthe most sensitive gauge for the influence of the charge on the mass of the\nparticles. Any valid model of the elementary particles must, in the end, be\nable to determine the ratios of the particle masses to the electron mass. In\nparticular the one hundred years old problem of why is the mass of the proton\n1836 times larger than the mass of the electron has to be solved.\nThe ratios m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) were first discussed by Nambu\n[2] who noted that m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) is approximately 3/2\u03b1f * m(e\u00b1 ) and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) is approximately 2/\u03b1f * m(e\u00b1 ), where \u03b1f = e2 /h\u0304c \u223c\n= 1/137 is the fine structure\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nconstant. More accurate ratios m(\u03bc )/m(e ) and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) were later\nsuggested by Barut [3]. We have shown in Section 12 of [1] that fairly accurate values of the ratios m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) can be obtained\nfrom our explanation of the masses of the muons, pions and electron. Even\nwhen the consequences of the charge of \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 were neglected we arrived\nat values for the mass ratios which differed from the measured m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )\nby only 0.38% and from the measured m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) by 1.08%. We will now\nimprove our calculations of the ratios m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) and m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) by\ntaking also into account the consequences of the charge on the mass of the\nparticles.\n\n1\n\nThe charge in the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons\n\nWhen a \u03c0 \u00b1 meson is formed N/4 electron neutrinos \u03bde or anti-electron neutrinos \u03bd\u0304e , as well as N/4 electric oscillations come, according to Eq.(85) in\n[1], with the electron or positron into the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice. N/4 electron neutrinos\nor anti-electron neutrinos make up 1/2 of the mass of the electron. The N/2\nelectric oscillations or N/4 charge elements Qk make up the other half of the\nmass of the electron, as the explanation of the electron, we have put forward\nin [1], demands. The number N of all neutrinos in the neutrino lattice of the\n\u03c0 \u00b1 mesons without their charge is\nN = 2.854 * 10 9 ,\n\n(1)\n\nEq.(17) in [1]. N is an absolute number, neutrinos and antineutrinos are\ncounted equally.\n\n2\n\n\fThe N/4 electron neutrinos \u03bde originating from the electron cannot be\npart of the cubic \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons, because the corners of\nthe cubic cells are already filled with neutrinos. The additional electron- or\nanti-electron neutrinos must sit in the centers of the cell-sides. Likewise, the\nN/4 charge elements Qk can only sit in the centers of the cell-sides, because\nthe corners of the cubic cells of the neutrino lattice are filled with neutrinos.\nThe cells would then be face-centered cubic, Fig. 1. It is fundamental for the\nstability of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons that their lattice is face-centered. The lifetime of\nthe \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons is 2.6*10\u22128 sec, whereas the lifetime of the \u03c0 0 meson, which\ndoes not carry a charge, but has also a simple cubic lattice, is 8.4*10\u221217 sec.\nLattice theory finds that simple cubic lattices are not stable, whereas facecentered lattices are stable, which is reflected in the lifetime of the particles.\n\nFig. 1: A face-centered cubic cell. The cells of a face-centered\nlattice can have, but do not have to have, a particle in the center\nof each side of the cells. The thin lines connecting the points at\nthe centers of the cell-sides are only a visual aid.\nThe neutral cubic neutrino lattices of \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 seem to exist only in\nconjunction with an electric charge e\u00b1 . As noted on p. 18 of [1], a simple\ncubic lattice held together by a central force between the particles of the\nlattice is not stable according to Born [4]. A cubic lattice consisting only\nof neutrinos falls into this category. The charge e\u00b1 added to the neutral\nneutrino lattices of \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 makes their neutrino lattices \"stable\", because\n3\n\n\fthe neutrino lattices are then no longer simple cubic, but face-centered cubic.\nFace-centered cubic lattices are stable according to Born [4].\nThe N/4 charge elements Qk of a free charge e\u00b1 brought by e\u00b1 into\nthe neutrino lattice of the pion must remain intact, because the sum of the\ncharge elements is equal to the electric charge e\u00b1 , which must be conserved.\nWhere then do the charge elements of e\u00b1 sit in the lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons ?\nAccording to our explanation of the electron in [1] the charge elements of\ne\u2212 , and the electron neutrinos \u03bde in e\u2212 , form a simple cubic lattice, Fig. 8 in\n[1]. If this structure is maintained when a charge e\u00b1 attaches to the neutral\ncubic lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 meson, the charge elements should sit in the center\nof cell-sides which are perpendicular to the sides of the cells on which the\nadditional electron- or anti-electron neutrinos sit. The charged cubic cells of\nthe \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice would then be face-centered, as on Fig. 1.\nThe N/4 neutrinos and the N/4 charge elements Qk of the charge of \u03c0 \u00b1\ncannot oscillate with the frequency of the neutrinos in the cell corners. The\noscillation energy of the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice would then be proportional to 6 * N/4,\nwhich is not posible, because the oscillation energy of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons would\nthen exceed by 50% the oscillation energy of the neutral neutrino lattice,\nwhich is proportional to 4 * N/4. The additional neutrinos and the charge\nelements in the centers of the cell-sides oscillate with the same frequencies\nthey have in e\u00b1 , namely with a frequency proportional to \u03b1f \u03bd0 , as required\nby the oscillation frequencies in the electron or positron, given in Eq.(79) in\n[1]\nNh\u03bd0 * \u03b1f\n1\nE\u03bd (e ) = h\u03bd/kT\n*\n(e\n\u2212 1) 2\u03c0\n\u00b1\n\nZ\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n1\ne2 1\n*\n\u03c6 d\u03c6 = N * *\na f(T) 2\u03c0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\n\u03c6 d\u03c6 = 1/2 * m(e\u00b1 )c2 .\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n(2)\nIn Eq.(2) h is Planck's constant, the frequency \u03bd0 is given by \u03bd0 = c/2\u03c0a,\nwhere c is the velocity of light, a is the lattice constant, and \u03c6 = 2\u03c0a/\u03bb.\nThe term e2 /a in the second part of Eq.(2) comes from the relation h\u03bd0 \u03b1f\n= e2 /a. There are N/2 electric oscillations in e\u00b1 or N/4 charge elements.\nBecause the fine structure constant \u03b1f is \u223c\n= 1/137, the oscillation energy in\nthe electron adds little to the oscillation energy of the pions, E\u03bd (\u03c0 \u00b1 ).\nAs we have shown in [1] the ratio m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) is, not considering the\n\n4\n\n\fconsequences of the charge on the mass of \u03c0 \u00b1 , given by Eq.(103) therein\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\nm(\u03bd\u03bc )\n2\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n\u223c\n+\n2\n=\n276.072\n=\n1.0107\n(theor)\n=\n2\n[\n+\n1]\n(exp) ,\n=\nm(e\u00b1 )\nm(\u03bde )\n\u03b1f\nm(e\u00b1 )\n(3)\nwith\nm(\u03bde ) = \u03b1f * m(\u03bd\u03bc ) ,\n(4)\nfrom Eq.(72) in [1].\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) is\n\nThe empirical formula of Nambu [2] for the ratio\n\n2\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n(emp)\n=\n(exp) .\n\u2212\n1\n=\n273.072\n=\n0.99978\n\u03b1f\nm(e\u00b1 )\nm(e\u00b1 )\n\n(5)\n\nThe experimental ratio for m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) is\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )(exp) \u223c\n= 273.132 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )c2 = 139.570 MeV and m(e\u00b1 )c2 = 0.5109989 MeV.\nThe charge elements Qk brought by e\u00b1 into the neutral neutrino lattice\nof the pions add to the oscillation energy in the pion lattice. The oscillation\nenergy in the sum of the charge elements is equal to\n\u03a3k Qk = 1/2 * m(e\u00b1 )c2 = N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 ,\nfrom Eq.(84) in [1]. On the other hand, there may be a binding energy when\nan electron or positron is brought into the neutrino lattice of the neutral\npions. The oscillation energy of the neutrino lattice of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons is,\nEq.(34) of [1],\nE\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) = N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )]c2 ,\n(7)\nthe subscript 0 in \u03c00\u00b1 means that this deals with the pion without its charge,\nin other words with the neutrino lattice of \u03c0 \u00b1 . The oscillation energy in the\nelectron or positron is\nE\u03bd (e\u00b1 ) = 1/2 * m(e\u00b1 )c2 = N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 = N/4 * m(\u03bd\u0304e )c2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nfrom Eq.(84) in [1]. Using\nm(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) = m(\u03bd\u03bc ) and m(\u03bd\u0304e ) = m(\u03bde ) ,\n5\n\n(9)\n\n\ffrom Eqs.(68,71) in [1], we arrive, from the sum of Eq.(7) and Eq.(8), at the\noscillation energy in the charged pions\nE\u03bd (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) = N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )]c2 + N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe sum of the masses of the \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos in the lattice of the\nneutral pions is \u03a3i m(neutrinos)(\u03c00\u00b1 ) = N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )], from Eq.(33)\nin [1]. Adding to that the N/4 \u03bde or \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos which come with the charge\ne\u00b1 into the lattice, we find the energy in the sum of the neutrino masses in\nthe charged pions\n\u03a3i m(neutrinos)(\u03c0 \u00b1 )c2 = [N/2 * m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + N/2 * m(\u03bde )]c2 + N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 . (11)\nAdding to the oscillation energy in the neutral neutrino lattice of the pion\nE\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) (Eq.7) the energy in the sum of the masses of the neutrinos in the\nneutral pion lattice, N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )]c2 , and the energy in the mass of\ne\u00b1 , which is m(e\u00b1 )c2 = N/2 * m(\u03bde )c2 , Eq.(86) in [1], we find for the total\nenergy m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )c2 of the charged pions\n2\n\n2\n\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )c (theor) = E\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) + \u03a3i m(neutrinos)(\u03c00\u00b1 )c + m(e\u00b1 )c2\n= E\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) + N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )]c2 + N/2 * m(\u03bde )c2\n= Nm(\u03bd\u03bc )c2 + 3N/2 * m(\u03bde )c2 ,\n(12)\n2\n\nmaking use of E\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) = \u03a3i m(neutrinos)(\u03c00\u00b1 )c in the neutrino lattice of the\npion, and of m(e\u00b1 )c2 = N/2 * m(\u03bde )c2 .\nAfter division by m(e\u00b1 )c2 it follows from Eq.(12) that the ratio of the\nmass of the charged pions to the mass of the electron or positron is, using\nalso Eq.(4),\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\n2\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )\nm(\u03bd\u03bc )\n+\n3\n=\n+\n3\n=\n277.072\n=\n1.0144\n(theor)\n=\n2\n(exp) .\nm(\u03bde )\n\u03b1f\nm(e\u00b1 )\nm(e\u00b1 )\n(13)\nNambu's empirical ratio m(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) is 2/\u03b1f \u2212 1 = 273.072, Eq.(5); the\nexperimental mass ratio is 273.132, Eq.(6). The term 2/\u03b1f in Eq.(13) comes\nfrom the two neutrinos, a muon neutrino and an antimuon neutrino, which\nare in opposite corners of the cell-sides of the cubic neutrino lattice of \u03c0 \u00b1 .\nThe two \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc neutrinos make up nearly the entire mass in a cell-side. In\n6\n\n\fall cell-sides are then N/2 * \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) neutrinos. Since the oscillation energy is\nequal to the energy in the sum of the neutrino masses, the energy in the\nlattice is proportional to N * \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ). This divided by m(e\u00b1 ) = N/2 * m(\u03bde )(\u03bd\u0304e )\ngives, with Eq.(4), the 2/\u03b1f term.\nFrom the difference between the experimental mass of the pions and the\ntheoretical mass of the charged pions follows the binding energy of the electric\ncharge. The binding energy of the electron or positron to the neutrino lattice\nof the pions follows from the difference between Eq.(13) and Eq.(6) and is\n2\n\u2206E b (\u03c00\u00b1 , e\u00b1 ) = 3.94 m(e\u00b1 )c2 \u223c\n= 4 m(e\u00b1 )c .\n\n(14)\n\nThe binding energy can come only from the oscillation energy of the\nneutrinos in the corners of the cell-sides in \u03c0 \u00b1 , because of conservation of\nneutrino numbers, and because the oscillation energy of the charge elements\nbrought by e\u00b1 into \u03c0 \u00b1 must be conserved, since the sum of the charge elements represents the charge of the electron. The introduction of a neutrino\nand a charge element into the center of the sides of the cells of the cubic neutrino lattice causes a reduction of the oscillation frequencies of the neutrinos\nin the corners of the cell-sides.\nWe now subtract the binding energy in Eq.(14), divided by the energy in\nthe rest mass of the electron, that means \u2206E b (\u03c00\u00b1 , e\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )c2 = 4, from\nEq.(13) and find that the ratio of the mass of the charged pion to the mass\nof the electron is, after the binding energy is taken into account,\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )(theor) = 2/\u03b1f \u2212 1 ,\n\n(15)\n\nthe same as given by Nambu's formula (Eq.5). It also follows that\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )c2 (theor) = (2/\u03b1f \u2212 1) * m(e\u00b1 )c2 = 139.5395 MeV\n= 0.99978 m(\u03c0 \u00b1) c2 (exp) ,\n\n(16)\n\nor that we have explained the mass of the charged pions with an accuracy of\n2.2 * 10\u22124.\nIn simple terms, Eq.(103) in [1] gives the ratio of the mass of the neutrino\nlattice of the neutral pion to the mass of e\u00b1\nm(\u03c00\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )(theor) \u223c\n= 2/\u03b1f + 2 .\n7\n\n(17)\n\n\fAdding to the right hand side of this equation + 1 for the mass of the electron\nor positron added to the neutrino lattice of the neutral pions, and deducting\n4 for the binding energy of e\u00b1 to the neutrino lattice of the neutral pions,\ngives Nambu's empirical formula 2/\u03b1f \u2212 1, Eq.(5), for the ratio of the mass\nof the charged pions to the mass of the electron or positron, as it must be.\nTo summarize: We have found that the electron neutrinos or anti-electron\nneutrinos brought by e\u00b1 into the neutral neutrino lattice of the pions must\nsit in the center of the sides, e.g. the front and rear sides, of the simple\ncubic cells in the neutral neutrino lattice of the pions, and that the charge\nelements sit in the centers of cell-sides which are perpendicular to the sides\nwith the \u03bde or \u03bd\u0304e neutrinos coming from e\u00b1 . That means that the cells in\nthe \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice are face-centered cubic. And we have found that bringing e\u00b1\ninto the neutral neutrino lattice of the pions releases a binding energy which\nis \u2248 4 m(e\u00b1 )c2 , and that then the mass m(\u03c0 \u00b1 ) has been explained with an\naccuracy of 2.2 * 10\u22124.\n\n2\n\nThe charge in the \u03bc\u00b1 muons\n\nIn [1] we have shown that the masses of the muons and pions can be explained,\nwithin 1% accuracy, by the sum of the masses of electron neutrinos and muon\nneutrinos and their antiparticles in simple cubic lattices, and by the mass in\nthe energy of the oscillations of the neutrinos. Similarly the electron mass\ncan be explained by the sum of the masses of electron neutrinos in a cubic\nlattice plus the mass in the sum of the energy of electric oscillations. The\noscillation energy of the neutrinos in the neutral cubic lattice of the muons\nand pions is given by Eqs.(63) and (78) in [1]\nE\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1\n0)\n\n=\n\nE\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 )\n\nNh\u03bd0\n1\n= h\u03bd/kT\n*\n(e\n\u2212 1) 2\u03c0\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nf (\u03c6)d\u03c6 .\n\n(18)\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nAlthough the oscillations of a neutrino lattice are neutral, we must retain the\n\u00b1 superscript of \u03bc and \u03c0 in Eq.(18) because the neutrino lattices of e.g. \u03bc+\nand \u03bc\u2212 are not the same, but they have the same oscillation energy.\nIn \u03bc\u00b1 an electric charge e\u00b1 is bound to the massive neutral body of the\nmuons, which is about 205.768 m(e\u00b1 ). The body of the muons contains the\n8\n\n\fremains of the body of the pions from which the muons emerge in the decay\n\u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 + \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ). In a good approximation the body of the muons is 3/4\nof the body of the pions, m(\u03bc\u00b1 ) = 1.00937 * 3/4 * m(\u03c0 \u00b1). Either all \u03bd\u03bc or all\n\u03bd\u0304\u03bc neutrinos leave in the \u03c0 \u00b1 decay, the neutral body of the muons consists\ntherefore of 3/4 * N neutrinos. The composition of \u03bc\u00b1 is given by Eq.(66) in\n[1]. This equation does not consider the consequences of the charge on the\nmass of \u03bc\u00b1 , it reads\n\u00b1\n2\nm(\u03bc\u00b1\n0 ) = E\u03bd (\u03bc0 )/c + N/4 * m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + N/4 * m(\u03bde ) + N/4 * m(\u03bd\u0304e ) ,\n\n(19)\n\nor correspondingly with the antiparticles. m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = 49.91 milli-eV/c2 is the\nmass of the muon neutrino, and m(\u03bde ) = 0.365 milli-eV/c2 is the mass of\nthe electron neutrino, Eqs.(67,70) in [1], both can be exchanged by their\nantiparticles. Actually, conservation of neutrino numbers requires that N/8\nmuon neutrinos and N/8 anti-muon neutrinos leave the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice in the\ndecay of \u03c0 \u00b1 . Eq.(19) means that the rest mass of the muon m(\u03bc\u00b1 )( exp) =\n105.658 MeV/c2 is equal to the oscillation energy E\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1 )/c2 of the neutrinos\nin the lattice of the muons, plus the sum of the masses of the neutrinos in\nthis lattice.\nThe oscillation energy in the neutral muon lattice is the same as the\noscillation energy in the neutral pion lattice, as follows from the measured\nmasses of the muons and pions. According to Eq.(63) in [1] we have\nE\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) = E\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1\n0 ).\n\n(20)\n\nThe formula for the oscillation energy of a neutral neutrino lattice, Eq.(18),\napplies to the neutrino lattice of the muons only if N neutrinos are in \u03bc\u00b1 ,\nnot the 3/4 * N neutrinos one expects after either N/4 muon neutrinos or N/4\nanti-muon neutrinos have been removed from the lattice of the pions in the\n\u03c0 \u00b1 decay \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 + \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ). Applied to the neutral lattices of \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1\nthe difference in the number of the neutrinos is expressed by Eq.(64) in [1]\nwhich reads\nm(\u03c00\u00b1 ) \u2212 m(\u03bc\u00b1\n0 ) = N/4 * m(\u03bd\u03bc ) = N/4 * m(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) .\n\n(21)\n\nAccording to our explanation of the electron in Section 11 of [1] the charge\ne\u2212 carries N/4 electron neutrinos and the positron carries carries N/4 antielectron neutrinos. When a charge e\u00b1 is added to the neutral lattice of the\n9\n\n\fmuon with 3/4 * N neutrinos, the N/4 electron- or anti-electron neutrinos\nof e\u00b1 fill the lattice points made vacant by the emission of the muon- or\nantimuon neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 decay. With the N/4 neutrinos coming from\ne\u00b1 there are then N neutrinos in the lattice of the charged muon, that means\nthat the lattice is cubic, and Eq.(18) applies. It is likely that the N/4 charge\nelements brought also by e\u00b1 into the neutral, cubic neutrino lattice of the\nmuon occupy the centers of the cell-sides. The charge elements sitting in\nthe centers of the cell-sides of the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice do apparently not change their\nposition during the conversion from the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice to the \u03bc\u00b1 lattice in \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192\n\u03bc\u00b1 +\u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ). The lattice of \u03bc\u00b1 would then be face-centered cubic. We must\nnow add the energy in the sum of the charge elements, which is according\nto Eq.(84) in [1] equal to 1/2 * m(e\u00b1 )c2 or equal to N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 , and the\nenergy in the N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 neutrinos in the electron, to the energy in the\nmuon, Eq.(19), in order to obtain the energy in the charged muon.\nThe oscillation energy of the N neutrinos in the lattice of the pions is\ngiven by Eq.(7). The oscillation energy E\u03bd (\u03c00\u00b1 ) is equal to the energy in\nthe sum of the neutrino masses in \u03c0 \u00b1 , that means equal to N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) +\nm(\u03bde )]c2 , Eq.(7). The oscillation energy E\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1\n0 ) of the neutrino lattice of\n\u00b1\nthe neutral muons is the same as in \u03c0 according to Eq.(20). To E\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1\n0 ) we\nnow add the oscillation energy in the electron or positron, which is given by\nEq.(8)\nE\u03bd (e\u00b1 ) = 1/2 * m(e\u00b1 )c2 = N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 = N/4 * m(\u03bd\u0304e )c2 ,\n\n(22)\n\nThe oscillation energy in a free electron or positron must be preserved when\nthey are transferred to the neutral neutrino lattice of \u03bc\u00b1 , because the oscillation energy in the electron or positron represents the electric charge. The\noscillation energy in the charged muons is then\nE\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1 ) = N/2 * [m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + m(\u03bde )]c2 + N/4 * m(\u03bde )c2 ,\n\n(23)\n\nE\u03bd (\u03bc\u00b1 ) = N/2 * m(\u03bd\u03bc )c2 + 3/4 * N m(\u03bde )c2 .\n\n(24)\n\nor we have\n\nWe must now add to the oscillation energy of the charged muons, Eq.(24),\nthe energy in the sum of the masses of the neutrinos in the charged muon\nlattice. The sum of the neutrino masses in the charged lattice of the muons is\nequal to the sum of the neutrino masses in Eq.(19) plus N/4 * m(\u03bde ) from the\n10\n\n\fcharge. In other words, in \u03bc\u00b1 are N/4 muon neutrinos \u03bd\u03bc plus N/4 electron\nneutrinos \u03bde and N/4 anti-electron neutrinos \u03bd\u0304e , which come from the \u03c0 \u00b1\nlattice, and N/4 electron- or anti-electron neutrinos which come from e\u00b1 . In\ntotal N neutrinos are in the charged cubic \u03bc\u00b1 lattice. That means that\n\u03a3i m(neutrinos)(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 = N/4 * m(\u03bd\u03bc )c2 + 3/4 * N m(\u03bde )c2 ,\n\n(25)\n\nm(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) = m(\u03bd\u03bc ) and m(\u03bd\u0304e ) = m(\u03bde ) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwith\nas in Eq.(9). Adding Eq.(25) and Eq.(24), we find, not considering a possible\nbinding energy of the electron to the neutrino lattice of the muon, the energy\nin the charged muon\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 (theor) = [3/4 * N m(\u03bd\u03bc ) + 3/2 * N m(\u03bde )]c2 = 108.395 MeV , (27)\nwhereas\n\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 (exp) = 105.6584 MeV.\n\nWe will now see where the discrepancy between Eq.(27) and the experimental value of m(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 comes from. For this we need the energy in the rest\nmass of e\u00b1 which is, in our model of the electron, according to Eq.(86) in [1],\nm(e\u00b1 )c2 = N/2 * m(\u03bde )c2 = N/2 * m(\u03bd\u0304e )c2 .\n\n(28)\n\nDividing Eq.(27) by Eq.(28) gives the ratio of the mass of the charged muon\nto the mass of the electron or positron\n3\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\n3 m(\u03bd\u03bc )\n*\n+\n3\n=\n+\n3\n=\n208.554\n=\n1.0086\n(theor)\n=\n(exp) ,\n2 m(\u03bde )\n2\u03b1f\nm(e\u00b1 )\nm(e\u00b1 )\n(29)\nusing m(\u03bde ) = \u03b1f * m(\u03bd\u03bc ), Eq.(4). The term 3/2\u03b1f in Eq.(29) comes from the\nsingle muon or antimuon neutrinos in the cell-sides of the neutrino lattice\nof \u03bc\u00b1 . In the lattice are then N/4 * \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) neutrinos. With the oscillation\nenergy which is, as in the pion, proportional to N/2 * m(\u03bd\u03bc )(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ), the energy\nin the lattice is proportional to 3/4 * N * m(\u03bd\u03bc )(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ), neglecting m(\u03bde ). Divided\nby m(e\u00b1 ) = N/2 * m(\u03bde )(\u03bd\u0304e ) gives, with Eq.(4), the 3/2\u03b1f term. The 3/2\u03b1f\nterm in Eq.(29) makes the theoretical ratio m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) independent of the\nvalues of N, m(\u03bde ) and m(\u03bd\u03bc ).\nThe ratio m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) in Eq.(29) differs by + 2 from the empirical formula of Barut [3]\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\n3\n+\n1\n=\n206.554\n=\n0.99896\n(emp)\n=\n(exp) ,\n2\u03b1f\nm(e\u00b1 )\nm(e\u00b1 )\n11\n\n(30)\n\n\fwith m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )(exp) = 206.768. We attribute the difference + 2 between\nEq.(29) and Eq.(30) to the binding energy of the electron or positron to the\nneutrino lattice of the neutral muon. That means that\n2\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u2206E b (\u03bc\u00b1\n0 , e ) = 2 m(e )c .\n\n(31)\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 2\nSubtracting from Eq.(27) the binding energy \u2206E b (\u03bc\u00b1\n0 , e ) = 2 m(e )c =\n2\nN m(\u03bde )c , we find the total energy in the charged muons. Simplifying with\nEq.(26) we have\n\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 (theor) = [3/4 * Nm(\u03bd\u03bc ) + 1/2 * Nm(\u03bde )]c2\n= 107.35 MeV = 1.0160 m(\u03bc\u00b1)c2 (exp) ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhereas m(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 (exp) = 105.658 MeV. We attribute the difference between\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 (theor) and m(\u03bc\u00b1 )c2 (exp) to the uncertainty of the parameters N,\nm(\u03bd\u03bc ) and m(\u03bde ), all of which are uncertain by about 1%.\nWe can, however, eliminate the dependence of Eq.(32) on N, by dividing\nEq.(32) by the mass of e\u00b1 , Eq.(28). It follows for the ratio of the mass of the\ncharged muons to the mass of e\u00b1 that\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\n3 m(\u03bd\u03bc )\n*\n+1,\n\u00b1 (theor) =\n2 m(\u03bde )\nm(e )\n\n(33)\n\nwhich does not depend on N any more, but still on m(\u03bd\u03bc ) and m(\u03bde ). We\nnow eliminate also the uncertainty of the neutrino masses through m(\u03bde ) =\n\u03b1f * m(\u03bd\u03bc ) (Eq.4), and find that\n3\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )\n(theor)\n=\n(exp) ,\n+\n1\n=\n206.554\n=\n0.99896\n2\u03b1f\nm(e\u00b1 )\nm(e\u00b1 )\n\n(34)\n\nwhich is equal to Barut's formula, Eq.(30). The experimental ratio\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 )(exp) = 206.768 is 1.00104 times larger than our theoretical\nvalue for m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) = 206.554, which we find when we take the binding\nenergy into account. The fine structure constant \u03b1f in Eq.(34) is an exactly\nknown constant, so the theoretical value of m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) is very firm. Taking\nthe binding of the electron to the neutrino lattice of the muon into account\nwe have explained from our model of the muon the empirical formula for the\nratio m(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) suggested by Barut [3], following an earlier suggestion\nby Nambu [2]. Barut's formula is accurate to about one part in a thousand.\n12\n\n\fEq.(34) means also that we have determined theoretically the rest mass of\nthe muon with an accuracy of one part in a thousand.\nWe have thus shown that the binding energy of the electric charge e\u00b1\nbrought into the neutrino lattice of the neutral muons is 2 m(e\u00b1 )c2 . We\nhave also found from equations (14) and (31) that the binding energy of\nan electron or positron in the \u03c0 \u00b1 lattice is twice the binding energy of e\u00b1\nin the \u03bc\u00b1 lattice. The difference of both binding energies appears to be a\nconsequence of the presence of only one muon neutrino or anti-muon neutrino\nin a side of each cell of the muon lattice, whereas one muon neutrino and\none anti-muon neutrino are in the sides of each cell of the pion lattice.\n\nConclusions\nWe have been concerned with the consequences of the presence of the electric\ncharge e\u00b1 in the mass of the muon \u03bc\u00b1 and the pion \u03c0 \u00b1 , and with the explanation of the experimental ratios of the masses of \u03bc\u00b1 and \u03c0 \u00b1 to the mass of\nthe electron or positron,\nm(\u03bc\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) = 206.7683 = 1.00104 * (3/2\u03b1f + 1),\nm(\u03c0 \u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) = 273.1320 = 1.00022 * (2/\u03b1f \u2212 1) .\nIn both cases the terms on the right hand side of the equations with half\ninteger or integer multiples of 1/\u03b1f agree exactly with what one expects from\nour model of the particles consisting of lattices of muon neutrinos, anti-muon\nneutrinos, electron neutrinos and anti-electron neutrinos, whose masses are\nrelated by m(\u03bde ) = \u03b1f * m(\u03bd\u03bc ).\nFrom the ratios of the measured particle masses to the mass of the electron\nor positron follows furthermore that integer multiples of 1/\u03b1f are in\nm(K\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) = 966.102 = 0.99984 * (7/\u03b1f + 7) ,\nm(K0 )/m(e\u00b1 ) = 973.873 = 0.99961 * (7/\u03b1f + 15) ,\nm(n)/m(e\u00b1 ) = 1838.684 = 1.000098 * (14/\u03b1f \u2212 80) ,\nm(p)/m(e\u00b1 ) = 1836.153 = 1.000081 * (14/\u03b1f \u2212 82.5) ,\nm(D\u00b1 )/m(e\u00b1 ) = 3658.13 = 0.997 * (28/\u03b1f \u2212 168) ,\nas it should be if m(n) \u223c\n= m(p + n\u0304).\n= 2 m(K0 ), and as it should be if m(D\u00b1 ) \u223c\n13\n\n\fThe integer numbers added to the 1/\u03b1f terms in the mass ratios above\ndo, however, not agree, in each of the mass ratios listed, with what one\nexpects from our model of the neutral neutrino bodies of the particles. These\ndifferences are caused by the introduction of the electric charges e\u00b1 into the\nneutrino bodies of the particles. The introduction of e\u00b1 into the neutral body\nof a particle changes the number of the electron neutrinos or anti-electron\nneutrinos in the particles, not the number of the muon neutrinos or anti-muon\nneutrinos.\nWhen an electric charge e\u00b1 is introduced into the large neutrino bodies of\nthe pion and muon an exothermic binding energy is released, which amounts\nin the case of \u03bc\u00b1 to 2 m(e\u00b1 )c2 , and in the case of \u03c0 \u00b1 to 4 m(e\u00b1 )c2 . We have\nlearned that the ratio of the mass of the charged muons to the mass of the\nelectron or positron can be explained with an accuracy of about 1 * 10\u22123 , and\nthat the ratio of the mass of the charged pions to the mass of the electron\nor positron can be explained with an accuracy of 2.2 * 10\u22124 , if the binding\nenergy of the charge to the neutrino lattices of the muons and pions is taken\ninto account.\nWe have also learned that the electron neutrinos or anti-electron neutrinos, as well as the charge elements, brought by the charge into the simple\ncubic neutrino lattice of the pions must sit in the center of the sides of the\ncubic cells of the neutrino lattice of the pions, making them face-centered cubic cells, which is essential for the stability of the \u03c0 \u00b1 mesons. It seems likely\nthat the electron or anti-electron neutrinos brought by e\u00b1 into the muon\nlattice occupy the places vacated by the emission of the muon neutrinos or\nanti-muon neutrinos in the \u03c0 \u00b1 decay, that means that the muon lattice is\ncubic. The charge elements brought also with e\u00b1 into the neutral lattice of\nthe muons make the cells in the charged muons face-centered cubic.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nKoschmieder, E.L. http://arXiv:0804.4848v8 (2013).\nNambu, Y.
