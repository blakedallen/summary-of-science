In the framework of the\ncavity method, in the limit of an infinite number of points, we derive equations for pk , the\nprobability for some given point to be matched to its k-th nearest neighbor in the optimal\nconfiguration. These equations are solved in two limiting cases : r = 0 - where we recover\npk = 1/2k , as numerically conjectured by Houdayer et al. and recently rigorously proved\nby Aldous - and r \u2192 +\u221e. For 0 < r < +\u221e, we are not able to solve the equations\nanalytically, but we compute the leading behavior of pk for large k.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet us consider a set of N points i = 1, . . . N , N even, and 'distances' between them lij = lji . A\nmatching is a partition of this set into N/2 pairs. The 'length' of such a matching is\nL=\n\nX\n\nlpair\n\n(1)\n\npair\u2208matching\n\nWe focus on the properties of the minimal length matching. If the lij are random variables,\nit is known that in many cases, the length of the optimal configuration and other quantities\nconverge with probability 1 to their average value when N \u2192 +\u221e. A lot of different probability\ndistributions of the lij can be considered. In this note, we deal with the case where the lij are\nindependent and identically distributed random variables, with a law \u03c1(l) defined on [0, +\u221e[.\nAs noted in [1], in the infinite N limit, the only relevant feature of \u03c1 is its behavior around 0,\nsay\nlr\n(2)\nl\u21920 r!\nIn the following we stick to the tradition that r is an integer, which simplifies results though\nit should not be difficult to generalize our computations to a non integer r. The thermodynamic\nlimit of this model has been studied for a long time from the point of view of the statistical\nphysics of disordered systems. The replica method yielded predictions for the mean length and\nthe distribution of the lengths of occupied links in the optimal configuration [2]. This was shown\nto be equivalent to a cavity approach [3].\n\u03c1(l) \u223c\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ngiorgio.parisi@roma1.infn.it\nmatthieu.ratieville@roma1.infn.it\n\n1\n\n\fNumerical works checked the validity of the results obtained with these techniques [4, 5],\nand dealt with another quantity, the probability pk for some given point to be connected to its\nk-th nearest neighbor in the optimal matching. Houdayer et al. [5] conjectured that, in the case\nr = 0, one simply has\n1\n(3)\n2k\nRecently, Aldous [6] confirmed the mentioned predictions by rigorous proof in the case r = 0,\nand gave heuristic indications to generalize his method to an arbitrary r.\nIn this paper, we show that insight on pk can also be gained through a cavity approach, and\nin particular we recover (3). It gives further evidence that this method, as well as the replica\none, exactly describes the matching problem, though on non rigorous grounds.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, given any r we derive cavity equations for\npk and comment on their similarity with Aldous's ones [6]. In section 3 we check that in the\ncase r = 0 we recover (3). In section 4 we derive, for 0 < r < +\u221e, the leading behavior of pk\nfor large k. In section 5 we compute pk in the limit r \u2192 +\u221e. Section 6 is the conclusion. All\nimportant results are supported by numerical simulations.\npk =\n\n2\n\nThe cavity prediction for pk\n\nThe cavity equations at finite temperature have been derived in [3] (see also [7]). Let us briefly\nrecall the essential steps - basically we reproduce [8]. One writes down a partition function for\nthe matching problem\nX\n\nZ=\n\nmatchings\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n\nexp \u2212\u03b2N r+1 Lmatching\n\n\u0011\n\n(4)\n\n1\n\nwhere the scaling factor N r+1 insures that the free energy F = \u2212(1/\u03b2) ln Z is an extensive\nquantity.\nA tractable representation of this partition function can be borrowed from the theory of\npolymers [9]. One introduces on each site a m dimensional vector spin Si = (Si1 , . . . Sim ) normalized by S2i\u0010 = m. Let d\u03bc \u0011be the integration measure on the corresponding sphere. If we define\nTij = exp \u2212\u03b2N 1/(r+1) lij , one can check that\nZ = lim\n\nm\u21920\n\nZ Y\ni\n\nthanks to the following property\nlim\n\nm\u21920\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb\n\nSi1 d\u03bc(Si ) exp \uf8ed\n\nX\ni<j\n\n\u03b1\n\n\uf8f6\n\nTij Si .Sj \uf8f8\n\nd\u03bc(Si )Si\u03b11 Si\u03b12 * * * Si p = 0\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nunless p = 2 and \u03b11 = \u03b12 ; in this case we have limm\u21920 d\u03bc(Si )(Si\u03b1 )2 = 1. The spontaneous\nmagnetization of spin i has components m\u03b1i = \u03b4\u03b1, 1 mi .\nThe cavity method consists in adding a new point i = 0 to a system of N points i = 1, . . . N .\nThe partition function of the new system is computed assuming that the correlations of the N\nold spins can be neglected (technically speaking we suppose there is a single pure state): each\nspin lives in an effective field hi . So one writes\nR\n\n2\n\n\fZN +1 =\n\nZ Y\nN\n\nSi1 d\u03bc(Si ) exp\n\nN\nX\n\nhi Si1\n\n+\n\ni=1\n\ni=0\n\nN\nX\n\nT0i S0 .Si + h0 S01\n\ni=1\n\n!\n\n(7)\n\nThis is easily computed, thanks to (6), and one gets by differentiation of ln Z with respect\nto h0\n1\ni=1 T0i mi\n\n(8)\n\nm0 = P N\n\nwhere we used the fact that mi , the magnetization of site i before the addition of the new point,\nis nothing but 1/hi .\nNote that in principle N should be kept even, but it has no incidence on our results in the\ninfinite N limit. The occupation number of link 0 \u2212 i reads\nn0i = m0 T0i mi\n\n(9)\n\nWe are interested in the zero temperature limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, for in this limit only the optimal\nconfiguration contributes. The probability distribution of the magnetizations in this limit has\nalready been derived for another optimization problem, the travelling salesman problem [10].\nWe follow the same lines. It is useful to set\nmi = e\u03b2\u03c6i\n\n(10)\n\nLet us then define\n1\n\n\u03c7i = N r+1 l0i \u2212 \u03c6i\n\ni = 1, . . .

The \u03c7i are also independent random variables.

It involves as a basic ingredient the function G determined\nby equation (19), the other quantities being expressed in terms of G. This equation is actually\nwell known, for it also appears in the solution with replicas (see [2], eq. (22)), up to normalization\nconventions. The advantage is that, within the cavity approach, G is given a simple probabilistic\ninterpretation in terms of the occupation numbers. This enables us to easily compute elaborate\nquantities such as pk , which is hardly tractable with replicas.\nAldous notices that his method also yields equation (19) (see section 5.1 of [6]), but we would\nlike to stress that his approach and ours actually meet at an earlier stage: indeed our essential\nequation is not (19) but rather the couple (12)-(13); the rest, including the introduction of G,\nis mere calculus. Roughly speaking, Aldous's method consists in linking the N \u2192 +\u221e limit\nof the matching problem to a matching on an infinite tree. Let us concentrate on case r = 0.\nSuch matching is constructed introducing i.i.d. r.v. X - related to the root - and (Xi )i\u22651 -\nrelated to its children -, and the points (\u03bei )i\u22651 of a Poisson process of rate 1 (see section 3.3 of\n[6]). These quantities satisfy\nX = min(\u03bei \u2212 Xi )\ni\u22651\n\n(30)\n\nand the root of the infinite tree is matched to its child attaining the minimum.\nThis is strongly reminiscent of (12)-(13). More precisely, if one relabels the l0i so that they\nbe sorted in increasing order, and consistently relabel the \u03c6i , the probability law of (N l0i )i\u22651\ntends to a Poisson process of rate 1. Thus (12) becomes identical to (30), provided we identify\nXi and \u03c6i .\nIndeed, if we also take into account Aldous's heuristic considerations, similarities can be\nfound even before (12): in section 5.3 of [6], Aldous gives indications for a possible extension of\nhis method to the finite temperature problem. Using the same kind of r.v. as in (30) he writes\ndown the equation\nX=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n\u2212\u03bb\u03bei\n\ne\n\ni=1\n\nXi\n\n!\u22121\n\n(31)\n\nwhich can be identified with the cavity equation (8). Of course, the same way we derive (12)\nfrom (8) using trick (10), Aldous observes that (31) is consistent with (30) in the \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e limit.\nSuch formal similarities are striking but we are unable to account for them. Whether some\nfurther study can lead to more a rigorous basis for the cavity method is not clear, because we\ndefine the mi , \u03c6i through the somewhat exotic procedure of taking the m \u2192 0 limit of a m-spin\nmodel.\n\n3\n\nThe case r = 0\n\nFor r = 0, equation (19) is easily solved.

Extrapolating upon comparison with results for r = 0, 1, 2, 3, one can see that for small k,\nsay up to k \u223c 6, pk little varies when r increases. And these are the values of k for which pk is\nsignificant. For larger values of k the range of relative variation is more important, and diverges\nwhen k \u2192 +\u221e (compare (71) and (3)). But then anyway pk remains very small. Beside, it\nseems that p2 , p3 and p4 decrease with r whereas all other pk increase.\nWe have not tried to see whether some of these features hold for the Euclidean random\nmatching problem in dimension d - where the lij are the usual distances between N points\nindependently and uniformly distributed in the hypercube [0, 1]d , which is believed to be equivalent to the uncorrelated version we study here in the limit r = d\u2212 1 \u2192 +\u221e [5, 11]. In particular,\none expects pk in this limit to be the same for both versions.\n\n13\n\n\f6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that the cavity method yields predictions for pk which are consistent with both\nrigorous results and numerical simulations.\nLet us emphasize that our results also hold for the bipartite minimum matching (or assignment) problem. It has already been observed that the latter and the problem we discussed in\nthis paper are equivalent in the N \u2192 +\u221e limit, up to normalization conventions [5, 6]. In\nappendix B we briefly show how this can be seen within our formalism.\n\nAppendix A: Derivation of some properties of \u03b1\nHere we write \u03b1r for \u03b1, to highlight its dependence on r.

Thus\nr\n\nfr+1 (\u03b1rr+1 ) > fr (\u03b1r ) = 1\nIt follows that\n\n14\n\n(78)\n\n\fr\n\n\u03b1rr+1\n1\n1+ r\n\u03b1r\n1\n(\u03b1r \u2212 1)r\n\ni.e.\n\n< \u03b1r+1\n> 1+\n\n(79)\n1\n\n\u03b1r+1\nr+1\n\n1\n(\u03b1r+1 \u2212 1)r+1\n\n>\n\nby (73)\n\n(\u03b1r \u2212 1)r increases with r, and goes to 1 when r \u2192 +\u221e, as shown by (76). More precisely,\nit goes exponentially fast to this limit: (73) implies\nr\n\n2\n\ni.e.\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u22121\n(\u03b1r \u2212 1)r\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0012\n\n=\n\n2\n\u03b1r\n\n(\u03b1r \u2212 1)r = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0013r\n\n\u21921\n\nby (76)\n\n1\n1\n+ o( r )\nr\n2\n2\n\n(80)\n\nAppendix B: Note on the bipartite minimum matching problem\nThe bipartite minimum matching problem can be stated as follows: take 2N points i = 1, . . . 2N\ndivided into two subsets, A (i = 1, . . . N ) and B (i = N + 1, . . . 2N ) such that the distances\nbetween a point in A and a point in B follow the probability distribution \u03c1 of (2), and allow\nonly matchings where each pair is made of a point from A and a point from B. One can see\nit as a particular case of non bipartite matching problem for the points in A \u222a B, setting that\nthe distances inside each subset are infinite, i.e. Tij = 0 for (i, j) \u2208 {1, . . . N }2 or (i, j) \u2208\n{N + 1, . . . 2N }2 . Then imagine that you add a new point i = 0 to, say, subset A .The cavity\nequation (8) is slightly modified\nm0 = P2N\n\n1\n\ni=N +1 T0i mi\n\nwhere\n\nTij = e\u2212\u03b2(2N )\n\n1\nr+1 l0i\n\n(81)\n\n(82)\n\nProvided we relabel the mi , i = N+1, . . . 2N and redefine \u03b2, we get exactly the same equation\n(8) as in the case of the non bipartite matching problem. Indeed it is known from the replica\napproach [12] that, for systems where the lengths lij are uncorrelated random variables, the\nbipartite and non bipartite matching problems have the same limit when N \u2192 +\u221e and differ\nin the 1/N corrections.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
