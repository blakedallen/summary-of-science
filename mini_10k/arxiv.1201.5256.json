A search for pair-produced\nLQs assumed to couple only to quarks and leptons of the\nfirst SM generation is described in Ref. [1], using 1.03 fb\u22121\nof data, for two different final states. In the first one both\nLQs decay into an electron and a quark, while in the second final state one of the LQs decays into an electron and\na quark and the other LQ decays into an electron-neutrino\nand a quark. These result in two different experimental signatures. One such signature is the production of two electrons and two jets and the other one comprises one electron, two jets, and missing transverse momentum.\nNo excess over SM background expectations is observed in the data, and 95% confidence level (CL) upper bounds on the production cross-section are thus determined.\nThe results from the two final states are combined and presented in the \u03b2 versus LQ mass plane in Fig. 1, where \u03b2 is\nthe branching ratio for a single LQ to decay into a charged\nlepton and a quark. For \u03b2 = 1, LQ masses up to 660 GeV\nare excluded.\na\n\ne-mail: nicolas.bousson@cern.ch\n\n2.2 New heavy quarks\n\nNew heavy quarks are among the simplest extensions to\nthe SM. A search for pair-produced exotic top partners T T\u0304 ,\neach decaying to a top quark and a stable, neutral weaklyinteracting particle A0 , has been conducted in Ref. [2] with\n1.04 fb\u22121 of data. The search is performed in the tt \u0304 singlelepton channel where one W boson produced by the top\npair decays to a lepton-neutrino pair and the other W boson decays to a pair of quarks, resulting in a final state\nwith an isolated lepton, four or more jets and large missing\ntransverse momentum. Assuming a T T\u0304 \u2192 tt \u0304A0 A0 branching ratio of 100%, T masses up to 420 GeV are excluded\nat the 95% CL for an A0 mass below 10 GeV. This limit is\nalso valid for different models that have a final state identical to the one presented here. In particular, it can be applied\nto the case of a fourth sequential SM generation, that could\nhave major implications, e.g. in cosmology.\n2.3 Vector-like quarks\n\nWhile a fourth generation of chiral fermions may exist,\nthere are actually strong constraints on it from EW mea-\n\n\fEPJ Web of Conferences\n\nq\n\n103\n\nW */Z *\n\n102\n\nl\nW/Z\n\nq'\n\n10\n\n\u03bd /l\n\nQ\nq\n\n\u222bL dt = 1.3 fb\n\n-1\n\n\u00b1 1\u03c3 Uncertainty\n\u00b1 2\u03c3 Uncertainty\nObserved Limit\n\n10-2\ndata / bkg\n\n\u223c =1\nLO Cross Section, \u03ba\nuD\nExpected 95% CLs upper limit\n\n10-1\n\n2\n\nxx\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\n\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 D q) \u00d7 BR(D \u2192 W q) [pb]\n\nATLAS\n\nData: s=7TeV\n\u03bc+fake\ntt\nb/c\nDiboson\nSingle top: Wt\nMTH=4 TeV\n\n1\n\nFig. 2.

Vector-like (VL) fermions escape these constraints, and are predicted by many extensions of the SM.\nThey would be a novel form of matter. In certain scenarios,\ne.g. extra-dimensions, VL quarks Q could couple sizeably\nto the light generation of quarks, leading to a strong signal at the LHC. For single production of such quarks, the\nt-channel, illustrated in Fig. 2, is dominant. A search for\nexperimental signatures with two jets and, either two leptons, or one lepton and missing transverse momentum, is\ndescribed in Ref. [3], using 1.04 fb\u22121 of data.\nNo evidence is found for such quarks, and upper limits\non the production cross-section times branching ratio to a\nvector boson and a quark are determined assuming reduced\ncouplings of 1 at the qV Q vertex (V = W or Z) in the\ndiagram in Fig. 2, as described in [3]. VL quarks masses\nare excluded up to 900 GeV at the 95% CL for the charged\ncurrent channel, as shown in Fig. 3, and up to 760 GeV\nfor the neutral current channel. These limits, which can be\nused to constrain different models of VL quarks [4], are the\nmost stringent to date on this model.\n\n3 Searches for strong gravity\nModels introducing extra dimensions can provide a solution to the hierarchy problem, which is that the Planck\nscale MPl \u223c 1016 TeV is higher than the EW scale MEW\nby many orders of magnitude. In these models, the Planck\nscale in (n+4) dimensions, MD , would be much smaller\nthan in four dimensions, because gravity propagates in all\n\ndimensions. If MD is in the TeV range, microscopic black\nholes (BH) could appear at the LHC, and evaporate by\nHawking radiation. While uncertainties on these models\nare large due to our ignorance of quantum gravity, classical approximation for BH production and semi-classical\napproximation for decay are assumed valid for BH masses\nhigher than a mass threshold, MT H \u001d MD .\n3.1 Search with same-sign dimuon events\n\nAs multiplicities of emitted particles are determined by the\nnumber of degrees of freedom of each particle type and\ntheir decay modes, BH events should have high multiplicity of tracks with high transverse momentum pT . This is\nexploited in Ref. [5], using 1.3 fb\u22121 of data. Figure 4 shows\nthe number of tracks with pT > 10 GeV for events containing two muons with the same charge. This latter requirement allows to lower SM backgrounds while retaining a\ngood signal acceptance. The region with Ntrk \u2265 10 is selected as the signal region.\nNo excess over the SM predictions is observed in the\ndata. Figure 5 shows exclusion regions that are derived in\nthe MT H versus MD plane. For k = MT H /MD = 5, which\nis a physically favored region, and n = 6, MT H up to \u223c 4.3\nTeV are ruled out.\n3.2 Search with lepton+jets events\n\nAnother way to exploit the high multiplicity of emitted particles is to search for excess of multi-object events produced at high \u03a3 pT of leptons and jets. A search is conducted in Ref. [6] selecting events with one isolated lepton\nwith pT > 40 GeV, at least three reconstructed objects with\npT > 100 GeV, at least one of which being a lepton, and\n\u03a3 pT > 1500 GeV.\n\n\f5\n\nATLAS\n\u221a\ns = 7 TeV\nR\nL dt = 1.3 fb\u22121\n\nk=\n\n3\n\nk=4\n\nk=5\n\nMT H [TeV]\n\n2011 Hadron Collider Physics symposium\n\nExpected limit\nExpected \u00b11\u03c3\n\nMT H = k MD\n\n4\nn=6 observed\n\nn=2 observed\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\nMD [TeV]\n\nFig. 5. 95% CL exclusion contours for non-rotating black holes in\nmodels with two and six extra dimensions.

For k = 5, MT H up to\n\u223c 4.7 TeV are ruled out.\n\nMany extensions of the SM include a light Higgs boson\n(h0 ), with a mass below 140 GeV, that decays to neutral,\nweakly-coupled particles that can be long-lived. For example, in Hidden Valley (HV) scenarios, a new hidden sector is weakly coupled to the SM through a communicator\nthat interacts with both sectors. A search for the Higgs decay, h0 \u2192 \u03c0v \u03c0v , where the \u03c0v is a weakly-interacting pseudoscalar and has a displaced decay to fermion anti-fermion\npairs f f \u0304 has been conducted with 1.94 fb\u22121 of data. Due to\nthe helicity suppression of the low-mass f f \u0304 pairs, the \u03c0v\ndecays predominantly to heavy fermions (bb\u0304, cc\u0304 and \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212 )\nin the ratio 85:5:8 %. However, the lifetime of the neutral\nstates is not specified and can have a very large range. This\nanalysis focuses on \u03c0v decays occuring in the Muon Spectrometer (MS) of the ATLAS detector. To improve background rejection, both \u03c0v 's are required to decay in the MS.\nThe analysis uses specialized tracking and vertexing reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct the vertices in the MS,\nfrom \u03c0v decays to jet pairs. This is illustrated in Fig. 7. For\nthe event selection, a dedicated, signature-driven trigger,\nwas developed to trigger on events with a \u03c0v decaying in\nthe MS.\nNo events are found in data which pass the selection\nrequiring two isolated vertices in the MS.

The open histograms correspond to the distributions expected in the presence of CIs with\ndifferent values of \u039b for both constructive (\u039b\u2212 , \u03b7LL = \u22121) and\ndestructive (\u039b+ , \u03b7LL = +1) interference.\nTable 2. Expected and observed 95% CL lower limits on the CI\nenergy scale \u039b for the electron and muon channels, as well as for\nthe combination of those channels.\n\n4.2 Contact interactions\n\nA wide range of new phenomena can produce modifications to the dilepton mass spectra predicted by the SM\nsuch as quark-lepton compositeness, extra dimensions, and\nnew gauge bosons. The predicted form of these deviations\nis often either a resonance or an excess in the number of\nevents in the spectra at high mass. If quarks and leptons are\ncomposite, with at least one common constituent, the interaction of these constituents would likely be manifested\nthrough an effective four-fermion contact interaction (CI)\nat energies well below the compositeness scale \u039b. Such a\nCI could also describe a new interaction with a messenger\ntoo heavy for direct observation at the LHC.\nIn the context of the left-left isoscalar model, which is\ncommonly used as a benchmark for CI searches, the differential cross-section for the process qq\u0304 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 can be\nwritten\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3DY\nF I (mll ) FC (mll )\n=\n\u2212 \u03b7LL\n+\ndmll\ndmll\n\u039b2\n\u039b4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mll is the final-state dilepton mass, and \u03b7LL = \u00b11, a\nparameter defining the chiral structure of the new interaction. The expression above includes a SM Drell-Yan (DY)\nterm, as well as DY-CI interference (F I ) and pure CI (FC )\nterms.\nA search for CI in dilepton channel is performed with\n1.08 fb\u22121 of data for the electron channel and 1.21 fb\u22121 for\nthe muon channel [7]. Figure 9 shows the dilepton mass\nspectra in the electron channel in data, and in simulation\nfor constructive and destructive interferences. There is no\nsignificant evidence for CI in the analysed data and thus\n\nlimits have been set on the CI scale \u039b at 95% CL, using\ntwo kinds of flat priors, which are summarized in Table 2.\nThese limits are the most stringent to date on \u03bc\u03bcqq CIs and\nexceed the best existing limits set by a single experiment\non eeqq CIs for light-quark flavors.\n\n5 Conclusion\nWhile there is still no direct evidence of new phenomena at\nthe LHC, the ATLAS Collaboration has set very stringent\nlimits on many exotic models, analysing 1.03-1.94 fb\u22121 of\nthe LHC data. Some of these limits are the most stringent\nto date, or are novel models never tested by any other experiment.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nATLAS Collaboration, arXiv:1112.4828.\nATLAS Collaboration, arXiv:1109.4725.\nATLAS Collaboration, arXiv:1112.5755.\nA.
