Introduction\nIn usual electrolyte theories, ions interact via the Coulombic potential in a fluid with\na homogeneous dielectric constant \u03b5. However, in most of such theories, the microscopic\nmolecular interactions between ions and solvent molecules are not explicitly considered.1\u20134)\nAround a microscopic ion such as Na+ or Cl\u2212 in a polar fluid, the ion-dipole interaction gives\nrise to a solvation (hydration) shell composed of a number of solvent molecules (those of\nthe more polar component for a mixture). The resultant solvation free energy per ion will be\ncalled the solvation chemical potential and will be written as \u03bcisol where i represents the ion\nspecies. It is important that \u03bcisol strongly depends on the solvent density and/or the composition for binary mixtures, with its typical values much larger than the thermal energy kB T . In\nthe supercritical region of pure water the density-dependence of \u03bcisol is very large. For binary\nmixtures,5, 6) let us introduce its derivative with respect to the composition \u03c6:\ngi = \u2212(kB T )\u22121 \u2202\u03bcisol /\u2202\u03c6,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich represents the degree of selective or preferential solvation of ions. Hereafter, \u03c6 is the\nwater composition in water-oil. Then gi > 0 for hydrophilic ions and gi < 0 for hydrophobic\nions. For strongly hydrophilic ions, \u03bcisol (\u03c6) should decrease very steeply in a concentration\n\n\fDRAFT\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nrange 0 < \u03c6 < \u03c6isol , where hydration shells are formed.4) Here \u03c6isol \u223c 0.002 for Br\u2212 in waternitrobenzene. In this paper, we discuss the selective solvation effects in the range \u03c6 > \u03c6isol\nassuming the presence of well-defined hydration shells even in the water-poor region, where\nthe variation of \u03bcisol (\u03c6) is milder but gi is still large (being of order 10 for monovalent ions).4)\nFurthermore, for polyelectrolytes and colloids, dissociation of ions can occur at their ionizable groups and the degree of dissociation sensitively depends on the local composition.7\u20139)\nTherefore, the ion densities and the solvent composition are strongly coupled ubiquitously\nin soft matter. Around colloids, polymers, proteins, and so on, very small heterogeneities in\nthe solvent composition drastically alter the ion distributions and the local electric potential. As our recent findings, this selective solvation induces (i) prewetting transitions on the\nsurfaces of ionizable rods (polyelectrolytes)9) and spheres (colloids),10) (ii) phase separation\n(precipitation) induced by a small amount of highly selective solute even outside the solvent\ncoexistence curve,11, 12) and (iii) mesophase formation in aqueous mixtures for an antagonistic\nsalt.2\u20134, 13\u201315)\nIn aqueous systems, the salt effect on the surface tension \u03b3 has been examined extensively\nfor an air-water interface,16\u201318) while it has not yet been well investigated for a liquid-liquid\n(oil-water) interface.19, 20) For a small amount of solute, most experimental interpretations\nhave been based on the Gibbs formula21, 22) \u03b3 = \u03b30 \u2212 kB T \u0393, where \u03b30 is the surface tension\nwithout solute and \u0393 represents the adsorption of solute per unit area. However, we have\nrecently shown the presence of a negative electrostatic contribution \u03b3el for a small amount of\ncharged solute. The resultant generalized Gibbs formula is written as,4, 23, 24)\n\u03b3 = \u03b30 \u2212 kB T \u0393 + \u03b3el .\nUsing the electric flux density D and the electric field E, we have\nZ\n\u03b3el = \u2212 dz D * E/8\u03c0\nZ\n= \u2212 dz\u03c1\u03a6/2,\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the integral is in the surface normal direction (k z). In the second line we have used\nthe Poisson equation \u2207 * D = 4\u03c0\u03c1 and the electric field expression E = \u2212\u2207\u03a6, where \u03c1 is the\ncharge density and \u03a6 is the electric potential. Here, D, E, and \u03c1 are supposed to vanish far\nfrom the interface. In this paper we also assume D = \u03b5E, where \u03b5 is a dielectric constant.\nThe electrostatic contribution is crucial for antagonistic salts23) and ionic surfactants.24) This\nresult has been derived from the calculation of the excess grand potential at a planar interface.\nIn this paper, we will calculate the excess free energy for small surface deformations, which\n\n\fDRAFT\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nis indeed expressed in terms of \u03b3 in eq.(2).\nIn this paper, we also discuss the surface instability induced by an antagonistic salt consisting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions.2\u20134, 13\u201315) An example is sodium tetraphenylborate NaBPh4 , which dissociates into hydrophilic Na+ with g1 \u001d 1 and hydrophobic BPh\u22124\nwith \u2212g2 \u001d 1. The latter anion consists of four phenyl rings bonded to an ionized boron.\nSuch ion pairs behave antagonistically in aqueous mixtures in the presence of composition\nheterogeneity. First, they undergo microphase separation around a liquid-liquid interface on\nthe scale of the Debye screening length. This unique ion distribution produces a large electric double layer,6, 23) leading to a large decrease in the surface tension23) in agreement with\nexperiments.19, 20) From x-ray reflectivity measurements, Luo et al.20) determined such ion\ndistributions around a water-nitrobenzene(NB) interface by adding BPh\u22124 and two species of\nhydrophilic ions. Second, they interact differently with water-rich and oil-rich composition\nfluctuations, leading to mesophases (charge density waves) near the solvent criticality. In\naccord with this prediction, Sadakane et al.13) added a small amount of NaBPh4 to a nearcritical mixture of D2 O and 3-methylpyridine (3MP) to find a peak at an intermediate wave\nnumber qm (\u223c 0.1 \u00c5\u22121 \u223c \u03ba) in the intensity of small-angle neutron scattering. The peak height\nwas much enhanced with formation of periodic structures. (iii) Moreover, Sadakane et al.\nobserved multi-lamellar (onion) structures at small volume fractions of 3MP (in D2 O-rich\nsolvent) far from the criticality,14) where BPh\u22124 and solvating 3MP form charged lamellae.\nThese findings demonstrate very strong hydrophobicity of BPh\u22124 . (iv) Another interesting\nphenomenon is spontaneous emulsification (formation of small water droplets) at a waterNB interface.25, 26) It was observed when a large pure water droplet was pushed into a cell\ncontaining NB and antagonistic salt (tetraalkylammonium chloride).\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec.2, we will present the background\nof selective solvation. In Sec.3, we will explain a Ginzburg-Landau model for electrolytes\naccounting for selective solvation. The surface tension formula (2) will be derived. In Sec.4,\nwe will first calculate the free energy for a slightly deformed interface and then present simulation results on the surface instability induced by antagonistic salt.\n2. Background of selective solvation\nLet us suppose two species of ions (i = 1, 2) with charges Z1 e and Z2 e (Z1 > 0, Z2 < 0).\nAt low ion densities, the total ion chemical potentials \u03bci in a mixture solvent are expressed as\n\u03bci = kB T ln(ni \u03bb3i ) + Zi e\u03a6 + \u03bcisol (\u03c6),\n\n(4)\n\n\fDRAFT\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the water composition and \u03bbi is the thermal de Broglie length (but is an irrelevant constant in the isothermal condition) and \u03a6 is the local electric potential. For neutral\nhydrophobic particles the electrostatic term is nonexistent. The \u03bci is a constant in equilibrium except for the interface region. We consider a liquid-liquid interface between a polar\n(water-rich) phase \u03b1 and a less polar (oil-rich) phase \u03b2 with bulk compositions \u03c6\u03b1 and \u03c6\u03b2 with\n\u03c6\u03b1 > \u03c6\u03b2 . Thus \u03bcisol (\u03c6) takes different bulk values in the two phases due to its composition\ndependence. So we define\n\u2206\u03bci\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bcisol (\u03c6\u03b2 ) \u2212 \u03bcisol (\u03c6\u03b1 ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is called the Gibbs transfer free energy (per ion here) in electrochemistry.4, 27\u201331) The\nbulk ion densities far from the interface are written as ni\u03b1 in phase \u03b1 and ni\u03b2 in phase \u03b2.\nFrom the charge neutrality condition in the bulk regions, we require Z1 n1\u03b1 + Z2 n2\u03b1 = 0 and\nZ1 n1\u03b2 + Z2 n2\u03b2 = 0. The potential \u03a6 tends to constants \u03a6\u03b1 and \u03a6\u03b2 in the bulk two phases,\nyielding a Galvani potential difference,\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u03a6\u03b1 \u2212 \u03a6\u03b2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nacross the interface. Here \u03a6 approaches its limits on the scale of the Debye screening lengths,\n\u03ba\u03b1\u22121 and \u03ba\u03b2\u22121 , away from the interface, so we assume that the system extends longer than \u03ba\u03b1\u22121\nin phase \u03b1 and \u03ba\u03b2\u22121 in phase \u03b2. For air-water interfaces, there are no ions in the air region, so\n\u03ba\u03b2 = 0, however. The continuity of \u03bci across the interface gives\nkB T ln(ni\u03b1 /ni\u03b2 ) + Zi e\u2206\u03a6 \u2212 \u2206\u03bci\u03b1\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere i = 1, 2. After some calculations, \u2206\u03a6 is expressed as6, 27)\n\u2206\u03a6 = [\u2206\u03bc1\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u2206\u03bc2\u03b1\u03b2 ]/e(Z1 + |Z2 |).\n\n(8)\n\nSimilar potential differences also appear at liquid-solid interfaces (electrodes).31) The ion\ndensities in the bulk two phases (in the dilute limit) are simply related by\n\u0014 |Z2 |\u2206\u03bc1 + Z1 \u2206\u03bc2 \u0015\nn1\u03b2 n2\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n=\n= exp \u2212\n.\n(9)\nn1\u03b1 n2\u03b1\n(Z1 + |Z2 |)kB T\nHowever, if three ion species are present, the ion partitioning between two phases is much\nmore complicated.23)\nThe Gibbs transfer free energy has been determined at present for water-nitrobenzene\n(NB)27\u201330) and water-1,2-dichloroethane(EDC)29) at room temperatures, where the dielectric\nconstant of NB (\u223c 35) is larger than that of EDC (\u223c 10). In the case of water-NB, the ratio\n\u2206\u03bci\u03b1\u03b2 /kB T is 13.6 for Na+ , 27.1 for Ca2+ , and 11.3 for Br\u2212 as examples of hydrophilic ions,\n\n\fDRAFT\n\nJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nwhile it is \u221214.4 for hydrophobic BPh\u22124 . In the case of water-EDC, it is 22.7 for Na+ and\n17.5 for Br\u2212 , while it is \u221214.1 for BPh\u22124 . The amplitude |\u2206\u03bci\u03b1\u03b2 |/kB T for hydrophilic ions is\nlarger for EDC than for NB and is very large for multivalent ions. For H+ (more precisely\nhydronium ions H3 O+ ), \u2206\u03bci\u03b1\u03b2 assumes positive values close to those for Na+ in these two\nmixtures.\n3. Ginzburg-Landau theory of mixture electrolytes\n3.1 Ginzburg-Landau free energy\nWe consider a Ginzburg-Landau free energy F for a polar binary mixture (water-oil)\ncontaining a small amount of a monovalent salt (Z1 = 1, Z2 = \u22121). The ions are dilute and\ntheir volume fractions are negligible. The variables \u03c6, n1 , and n2 are coarse-grained ones\nvarying smoothly on the molecular scale. We also neglect the image interaction,17) though it\nwas included in our previous papers.6, 23) See our previous analysis6) for relative importance\nbetween the image interaction and the solvation interaction at a liquid-liquid interface.

The critical value of \u03c7 is 2 without ions.\nThe \u03bbi = ~(2\u03c0/mi kB T )1/2 in eq.(11) is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the species i with\nmi being the molecular mass. The g1 and g2 are the solvation coupling constants assumed to\nbe constants.

To this end, we superimpose small deviations \u03b4\u03c6 and \u03b4ni on the equilibrium\ninterface profiles, \u03c6 = \u03c6(z) and ni = ni (z), respectively. For simplicity, we replace \u03c6(z) and\nni (z) by \u03c6(z \u2212 \u03b6) and ni (z \u2212 \u03b6), respectively. For small \u03b6. we set\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u2212\u03c60 (z)\u03b6,\n\n\u03b4ni = \u2212n0i (z)\u03b6,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c60 = d\u03c6/dz and n0i = dni /dz, Then the deviation of the dielectric constant \u03b4\u03b5 = \u2212\u03b51 \u03c60 \u03b6\nand that of the charge density \u03b4\u03c1 = \u2212\u03c10 \u03b4\u03b6 are linear in \u03b6, where \u03c10 = e(n01 \u2212 n02 ).

The static\nparameters employed are \u03c7 = 2.1, C = kB T a\u22121 , \u03b51 = 0, and `B = e2 /\u03b50 kB T = 3a. The Debye\nwave number is then \u03ba = (8\u03c0n0 `B )1/2 = 0.48a\u22121 . Space is measured in units of a = v1/3\n0 .\nThe water composition \u03c6 and the ion densities ni obey2, 3)\n\u2202\u03c6\nL0 2\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c6v) =\n\u2207 h,\n(43)\n\u2202t\nkB T\nD0\n\u2202ni\n+ \u2207 * (ni v) =\n\u2207 * ni \u2207\u03bci .\n(44)\n\u2202t\nkB T\nwhere L0 is the kinetic coefficient, D0 is the diffusion constant common to the cations and the\nanions, and h and \u03bci are defined by eqs.(17) and (18). Neglecting the acceleration term, we\ndetermine the velocity field v using the Stokes approximation,\nX\n\u03b70 \u22072 v = \u2207p1 + \u03c6\u2207h +\nni \u2207\u03bci .\n\n(45)\n\ni\n\nWe introduce p1 to ensure the incompressibility condition \u2207*v = 0. We set \u03b70 L0 /kB T = 0.16a4\nand D0 = a2 /t0 . Time is measured in units of\nt0 = a5 /L0 .\n\n(46)\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nThe right hand side of eq.(45) is also written as \u2207 * \u03a0, where \u03a0 is the stress tensor arising\nfrom the fluctuations of \u03c6 and ni . Here the total free energy F in eq.(10) satisfies dF/dt \u2264 0\nwith these equations (if the boundary effect arising from the surface free energy is neglected).\nWe integrated eq.(43) and (44) using eq.(45) at each step on a 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 lattice under the\nperiodic boundary condition in the x and y directions. The system length is then L = 64a. At\nthe top z = L/2 and the bottom z = \u2212L/2, we required Ez = \u2212\u2202\u03a6/\u2202z = 0 and \u2202ni /\u2202z = 0. The\nsystem was initially in a two-phase with a planar interface at z = 0 separating the two phases.\nIn Fig.3, we show the time development of n1 , n2 , n1 \u2212 n2 in the very early stage, and\n\u03a6, which illustrate establishment of the electric double layer in the time region t < 100t0 . In\nthis stage, the profiles of \u03c6 and ni are nearly one-dimensional and the surface undulations are\nnegligible. We can see establishment of a large electric double layer, where the electric field\nis of order kB T/e. The integral in eq.(23) is time-dependent here and may be regarded as an\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nDRAFT\n\neffective surface tension. It is about 0.2kB T/a2 at t = 0 and tends to a negative value of order\n\u22120.05kB T/a2 for t \u223c\n>50t0 in this case. Here, \u2206U \u223c 5 and eq.(42) gives kc \u223c 0.3a\u22121 .\nIn Fig.4, we display slower time-evolution of interface deformations after the establishment of the electric double layer induced by antagonistic ion pairs at t/t0 = 250, 500, 750,\nand 1000, where the domain size is of order 2\u03c0/kc in accord with eq.(42). While the linear\ngrowth theory holds for t <\n\u223c500t0 , the system is in the nonlinear growth regime with large\nsurface disturbances at t = 1000t0 . Note that this final time is of the order of the diffusion\ntime tD = L2 /4D0 \u223c 103 t0 . For t \u001d tD the system should tend to a bicontinuous mesophase\ndisplayed in our previous paper.3)\n5. Summary\nWe stress the crucial role of the selective solvation of a solute in phase transitions of various soft materials, which should be relevant in understanding a wide range of mysterious\nphenomena in water. Particularly remarkable in polar binary mixtures are mesophase formation induced by an antagonistic salt2\u20134) and precipitation induced by a one-sided solute (a\nsalt composed of hydrophilic cations and anions and a neutral hydrophobic solute).11, 12) Regarding the problem of mesophase formation, our theory is still insufficient and cannot well\nexplain the complicated phase behavior disclosed by the experiments.13\u201315)\nWe propose experiments of the surface instability. For example, it should be induced\naround a droplet of pure water (oil) inserted in a bulk oil-rich (water-rich) region in the immisible condition, where the droplet or the surrounding region contains a small amount of\nan antagonistic salt. The previous experiments of droplet formation25, 26) were performed in\nthe strong segregation condition far from the solvent criticality and, as a result, the surface\ntension might have not been negative even after the formation of an electric double layer.\nThus, experiments should also be performed on near-critical aqueous mixtures in two-phase\ncoexistence, where a small amount of an antagonistic salt is added to either of the water-rich\nor oil-rich region as in Sec.4 of this paper.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) from the\nMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.
