INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of granular materials and granular flows, see e.g. [1-3], has highlighted\nthe importance of the concept of inelastic collapse [4,5]. The canonical example of\ninelastic collapse concerns a ball bouncing on a static platform in a constant\ngravitational field g . If u 0 is the initial velocity with which the ball is thrown up\nfrom the platform, the velocity at subsequent bounces decreases geometrically until\nthe ball stops completely after a time \u03c4 c = 2u 0 /[ g (1 \u2212 r )] , where r is the coefficient of\nrestitution. Note that although the total number of flights until the collapse n f is\n\ninfinite, the total flight time until the collapse is actually finite. Analogous collapse\ntransitions are also predicted theoretically for a ball bouncing on a periodically\nvibrating plate [6-8] and for a randomly accelerated particle near an absorbing\nboundary [9-13]. Elegant experimental studies of inelastic collapse in granular layers\nsubject to vertical vibrations may be found in [14,15].\n\nThe question we address in this paper is as follows: How do these two physical\nobservables, namely (i) the number of flights n f till the collapse and (ii) the total time\n\n\u03c4 c elapsed before the collapse, behave for a ball bouncing on a platform which itself\nvibrates in a noisy manner? Let us first see what happens in a single collision between\nthe ball and the platform. Let v be the velocity of the platform and \u2212 ui be the\nincident velocity of the ball. Then, just after the collision, the platform velocity\nremains unchanged at v but the ball bounces with velocity\n\nub = rui + (1 + r )v\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\n\fwhere the coefficient of restitution 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 and r = 1 corresponds to the elastic limit.\nThis result can easily be derived by considering an inelastic collision between two\nparticles of mass m1 and m2 with incident velocities u1 and u 2 respectively. Let u1\u2032\nand u \u20322 be the post-collision velocities. Conservation of momentum implies that\nm1u1 + m2 u 2 = m1u1\u2032 + m2 u 2\u2032 and inelasticity implies u \u20322 \u2212 u1\u2032 = \u2212 r (u 2 \u2212 u1 ) . Solving these\n\ntwo equations when m2 >> m1 one gets u \u20322 = u 2 and\n\nu1\u2032 = \u2212ru1 + (1 + r )u 2 . In our\n\nexample, the platform corresponds to the massive particle with velocity u 2 = v and\nthe incident velocity of the ball is u1 = \u2212ui . This gives the result in Eq. (1). Thus, the\nbounce velocity u n of the ball after the n-th collision with the platform satisfies a\nsimple recurrence relation\n\nu n = ru n \u22121 + \u03b7 n\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b7 n = (1 + r )v n with v n being the velocity of the platform at the time of the n-th\ncollision. The recursion in Eq. (2) starts with initial value u 0 > 0 .\n\nWe take the simplest model of a noisy platform, which is broadly applicable if\nu n >> v n , by assuming that the velocities of the platform at different collision times\n\nare completely uncorrelated and each of them is drawn independently from a given\ndistribution. This is equivalent to saying that the noise variables \u03b7 n in Eq. (2) are\nindependent and identically distributed random variables, each drawn from a given\ndistribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) . We further assume that \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) is continuous and symmetric around\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b7 = 0 , i.e. \u03b7 n = 0 , and we scale the noise so that it has unit variance, i.e. \u03b7 n 2 = 1 .\nThus the typical platform velocity during a collision v n ~ O(1) . In practice, once\n\nu n ~ O(1) there will be an increased likelihood that the platform velocity at impact\nwill be positive [14] and the above assumptions break down. However, in such\ncircumstances we will assume that the ball basically 'sticks' to the platform through a\nprocess known as chattering [7]. Hence, in what follows, noting that once the bounce\nvelocity becomes negative for the first time the ball effectively hasn't bounced, we\nwill take this first-passage event as the definition of collapse.\n\nWhen the platform has noisy vibrations both the number of flights n f and the\ntotal time \u03c4 c till the collapse become random variables. Our main results, summarized\nbelow, concern the distributions P (n f ) and P(\u03c4 c ) of these two random variables.\n\n(i)\n\nIn the strictly elastic case r = 1 , we show that both of these distributions have\n\npower law tails: P(n f ) ~ n f\n\n\u2212\u03b1 1\n\nfor large n f and P (\u03c4 c ) ~ \u03c4 c\n\n\u2212\u03b1\n\n2\n\nfor large \u03c4 c , where\n\nthe exponents \u03b1 1 = 3 / 2 and \u03b1 2 = 4 / 3 are universal, i.e., independent of the noise\ndistribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) , as long as it is continuous and symmetric.\n\n(ii)\n\nIn the inelastic case r < 1 , on the other hand, both of these distributions have\n\nexponential tails: P(n f ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b81 (r )n f ] for large n f and P(\u03c4 c ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b8 2 (r )\u03c4 c ] for\n\nlarge \u03c4 c . The decay exponents \u03b81 (r ) and \u03b8 2 (r ) depend continuously on r and,\nmoreover, they are nonuniversal as they depend explicitly on the noise distribution\n\n\u03c1 (\u03b7 ) . The exact expressions for \u03b81 (r ) and \u03b8 2 (r ) for an arbitrary noise distribution\n\n4\n\n\f\u03c1 (\u03b7 ) are, in general, hard to obtain. As an illustration, we provide in an Appendix\nexplicit results for \u03b81 (r ) for the special noise distribution, \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) = 12 exp[\u2212 \u03b7 ] .\n\n(iii)\n\nAs one approaches the elastic limit, r \u2192 1 , the decay exponents \u03b81 (r ) and\n\n\u03b8 2 (r ) vanish irrespective of the noise distribution. Most interestingly, the manner in\nwhich these decay exponents approach zero as r \u2192 1 turns out to be universal. For\nexample, we find that as r \u2192 1 , \u03b81 (r ) \u2248 a (1 \u2212 r ) and \u03b8 2 (r ) \u2248 bg (1 \u2212 r ) 3 / 2 where g is\nthe gravitational constant and a, b are universal constants independent of the noise\ndistribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) . We show that while a = 1 is trivial, b = 0.405024... is nontrivial\nand is given by the smallest positive root of the equation, D2b 2 [\u22122 2b] = 0 where\nD p ( z ) is the parabolic cylinder function of index p and argument z [16].\n\nII. STRICTLY ELASTIC CASE\n\nWe first consider the strictly elastic case r = 1 , against which we wish to make\ncomparison once we have considered the inelastic case r < 1 . The recursion relation\nin Eq. (2) with r = 1 reduces to a standard random walk\n\nu n = u n\u22121 + \u03b7 n\n\n(3)\n\nstarting with the initial value u0 > 0 . The noise \u03b7 n is drawn independently for each n\nfrom the distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) such that \u03b7 n = 0 and \u03b7 n\n\n2\n\n= 1 . We would like to\n\ncompute the probability distributions of (i) the number of flights or collisions n f\n\n5\n\n\fbefore the collapse, i.e., before the velocity u n evolving via the random sequence in\nEq. (3) becomes negative for the first time, and (ii) the total flight time \u03c4 c =\n\n2\ng\n\n\u2211\n\nnf\nn=0\n\nun\n\nelapsed before the collapse.\n\nThese two distributions are, in general, nonuniversal in the sense that they depend\nexplicitly on the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) and are hard to compute for generic \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) .\nFor example, let us consider how one would calculate the distribution of the number\nof collisions before the collapse, P(n f , u 0 ) . Define Q(n, u 0 ) to be the probability that\nthe sequence in Eq. (3), starting at u 0 , does not change sign unto step n . Then\nP (n f , u 0 ) = Q(n f \u2212 1, u 0 ) \u2212 Q(n f , u 0 ) . The probability Q(n, u 0 ) satisfies the following\n\nintegral equation,\n\n\u221e\n\nQ(n, u 0 ) = \u222b Q(n \u2212 1, u \u2032) \u03c1 (u \u2032 \u2212 u 0 ) du \u2032\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nstarting from the initial condition, Q(0, u0 ) = 1 for all u 0 > 0 . Eq. (4) follows from\nconsidering what happens at the first step: suppose the ball jumps from u 0 to u \u2032 > 0 ,\nwith probability \u03c1 (u \u2032 \u2212 u0 ) . For the subsequent (n \u2212 1) steps, the probability of no\nsign change, starting initially at u \u2032 , is just Q(n \u2212 1, u \u2032) . The range of the integral [0, \u221e]\nfor u \u2032 in Eq. (4) ensures that the process didn't change sign in the first step. Note that\nEq. (4) uses the Markov property of the sequence in Eq. (3). Even though the right\nhand side of Eq. (4) has a convolution form, the exact solution for arbitrary n is\ndifficult due to the fact that the lower limit of the integral is zero. Naturally, the\ndistribution of the collapse time \u03c4 c will be even harder to compute analytically.\n6\n\n\fThere is, however, an important theorem due to Sparre Andersen [17] which, in\nrelation to the sequence Eq. (3), states the following: Given initial condition u0 = 0 ,\nthe probability P(n) that the process first becomes negative on the n-th step is\nactually independent of the step distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) , as long as it is continuous and\nsymmetric. In fact, the theorem proves that P (n) = \u0393(n \u2212 12 ) /[2 \u03c0 n!] , which implies\nthat P (n) ~ n \u22123 / 2 for large n [18]. In our problem u0 > 0 , so this theorem does not\nstrictly apply; nevertheless, it makes itself felt when discussing the tail of the\ndistribution of the number of collisions before the collapse, P (n f ) . We show later\nthat whilst the distributions P (n f ) and P(\u03c4 c ) are generically nonuniversal, their tails\nare algebraic with exponents that are universal. The behaviour at the tails can be\nderived by analysing the corresponding quantities for a continuous time Brownian\nmotion, which is much easier to analyse. Therefore, we first review these quantities\nfor the continuous time Brownian motion. In subsection II.B, we use these results to\npredict the tails of the distributions in the discrete case.\n\nA. Continuous time Brownian motion\n\nConsider a Brownian motion y (t ) evolving in continuous time t via the\nLangevin equation\n\ndy\n= \u03be (t )\ndt\n\n(5)\n\n7\n\n\fwhere \u03be (t ) is a zero mean white noise with correlator \u03be (t )\u03be (t \u2032) = \u03b4 (t \u2212 t \u2032) . The\nmotion starts at y (t = 0) = y0 . It is relatively straightforward to compute the\nprobability distributions of (i) the first-passage time t f at which the process crosses\nzero for the first time, and (ii) the area swept out by the process till its first-passage\ntf\n\ntime, A = \u222b y (t \u2032) dt \u2032 . Following [19], we first consider (for reasons that become clear\n0\n\nlater) the probability distribution P (T , y0 ) of the general observable\n\ntf\n\nT = \u222b V [ y (t \u2032)] dt \u2032\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwhere V [ y (t )] is an arbitrary functional of the process y (t ) and t f is the first-passage\ntime of the process. It is useful to study the Laplace transform of this distribution,\n\n\u221e\n\ntf\n~\nP ( s, y0 ) = exp \u23a1\u2212 s \u222b V [ y (t \u2032)] dt \u2032\u23a4 = \u222b P (T , y0 ) e \u2212 sT dT\n\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a5\u23a6\n0\n0\n\nwhere\n\n(7)\n\ndenotes an average over all realizations of the process till its first-passage\n\ntime. A typical path of the process over the time interval [0, t f ] may be split into an\ninitial step \u2206y during the interval [0, \u2206t ] followed by the remaining steps during the\ninterval [\u2206t , t f ] . Then Eq. (7) can be written as\n\ntf\n~\n~\nP ( s, y0 ) = exp \u23a1\u2212 s \u222b V [ y (t \u2032)] dt \u2032\u23a4 = e \u2212 sV [ y0 ]\u2206t P ( s, y0 + \u2206y )\n\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a5\u23a6\n0\n\n8\n\n\u2206y\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere \u2206y = \u03be (0)\u2206t . The average in the second part of Eq. (8) is over all possible\nrealizations of \u2206y . Expanding in powers of \u2206t and using the fact that the noise \u03be (t )\nis delta correlated, i.e., \u03be (0) 2 \u2248 1 / \u2206t as \u2206t \u2192 0 , one gets a backward Fokker~\nPlanck equation for P ( s, y0 ) in the space of the initial position y0 ,\n\n\u23a11 \u22022\n\u23a4~\n\u2212\nsV\ny\n[\n]\n\u23a2\n\u23a5 P ( s, y 0 ) = 0 .\n0\n2\n\u23a3 2 \u2202y0\n\u23a6\n\n(9)\n\nThis differential equation is valid in the range y0 \u2208 [0, \u221e] and satisfies the elementary\n~\n~\nboundary conditions P ( s, y0 \u2192 0) = 1 and P ( s, y0 \u2192 \u221e) = 0 .\n\nWe now consider certain choices for V [ y ] to make a connection with the\nproblems of interest. For the first-passage time distribution we need to choose\nV [ y ] = 1 , so that T = t f from Eq. (6). The solution of Eq. (9) with V [ y 0 ] = 1 can be\neasily obtained,\n\n~\nP ( s, y 0 ) = exp(\u2212 2 s y0 ) .\n\n(10)\n\nInverting the Laplace transform, we get the required first-passage time distribution, a\nresult which is well-known, see e.g. [20,21],\n\n\u239b y0 2 \u239e\n1 y0\n\u239f\nP (t f , y0 ) =\nexp\u239c \u2212\n3/ 2\n\u239c 2t \u239f\n2\u03c0 t f\nf \u23a0\n\u239d\n\n(11)\n\n9\n\n\fvalid for all y0 > 0 and t f > 0 .

(6) so that T = A . Then Eq.

The relationship between the discrete sequence and the\ncontinuous Brownian motion\n\nAs mentioned above, the tails of various distributions in the discrete case can be\nobtained by analysing their continuous counterparts. To make the connection between\nthe discrete and the continuous case, let us evolve the discrete sequence in Eq. (3) up\nto step n0 >> 1 , ensuring that it didn't change sign in between. At step n0 , the typical\nvalue of u no ~ n0 >> O(1) , a fact that simply follows from the central limit theorem.\nLet us now consider further evolution of the sequence for n > n0 , for which while\nu n >> O(1) , the increment \u03b4 u n = \u03b7 n ~ O(1) . We define a new scaled variable,\ny n = u n / n0 which then evolves for n > n0 as\n\ny n = y n\u22121 +\n\n1\n\u03b7n\nn0\n\n(16)\n\nstarting at y n0 = u n0 / n0 ~ O(1) at n = n0 . We next define \u2206t = 1 / n0 . In the limit of\nlarge n0 , \u2206t becomes small and t = (n \u2212 n0 )\u2206t can be considered as a continuous\n'time' variable. Writing y n \u2261 y (t = (n \u2212 n0 )\u2206t ) , dividing the Eq. (16) by \u2206t = 1 / n0 and\ntaking the limit of large n0 , we get back Eq. (5) for the continuous time Brownian\n\n11\n\n\fmotion following the identification \u03be (t ) = \u03b7 n / \u2206t = n0\u03b7 n . Thus, for n > n0 (where\nn0 is large), we expect that the results for the discrete sequence and the continuous\nprocess will coincide.\n\nFor example, the probability distribution P (n f , n0 ) of the number of flights n f\nbefore the collapse in the discrete sequence, for n f > n0 , can be read off the\ncorresponding continuous result in Eq. (11) after making the substitutions\ny n0 = u n0 / n0 and t f = (n f \u2212 n0 )\u2206t = (n f \u2212 n0 ) / n0 , and we get\n\n2\n\u239b\n\u239e\nu n0\nu n0\n1\n\u239c\n\u239f.\nP (n f , u n0 ) \u2248\nexp\n\u2212\n3/ 2\n\u239c\n\u239f\nn\nn\n2\n(\n\u2212\n)\nn\nn\n(\n\u2212\n)\n2\u03c0 f\nf\n0 \u23a0\n0\n\u239d\n\n(17)\n\nThis distribution thus has a power law tail for n f >> n0\n\nP (n f , u n0 ) \u2248\n\n1 u n0\n.\n3/ 2\n2\u03c0 n f\n\n(18)\n\nThis is the expression for the probability distribution of n f given that the sequence\ndidn't change sign up to n0 >> 1 and that the value of the sequence at step n0 is u n0 .\nTo calculate the unconditional distribution, one then has to average the expression in\nEq. (18) over u n0 ,\n\n12\n\n\fP(n f ) = P(n f , u n0 )\n\nu n0\n\n\u2248\n\n1 u n0\n.\n3/ 2\n2\u03c0 n f\n\n(19)\n\nThe exponent 3/2 comes from the continuous case and hence is universal, i.e.,\nindependent of the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) of the discrete sequence. Naturally, this\nobservation is intimately related to the Sparre Andersen theorem discussed earlier.\nNote, however, that the amplitude of the power law decay contains u n0\n\nwhich\n\ndepends explicitly on the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) .\n\nIn a similar way one can also derive, for the discrete sequence, the behaviour at\nthe tail of the distribution P (\u03c4 c ) of the total time elapsed till the collapse,\n\n\u03c4c =\n\n2\ng\n\n\u2211\n\nnf\nn =0\n\nu n . We split this sum into two parts, \u03c4 c = \u03c4 n0 + S , where \u03c4 n0 is the time\n\nelapsed up to step n0 >> 1 (given that the sequence didn't change sign in between)\nand S =\n\n2\ng\n\n\u2211\n\nnf\nn0\n\nu n is the time elapsed from step n0 up to the collapse at step n f . For\n\nlarge \u03c4 c , S >> \u03c4 n0 and hence \u03c4 c \u2248 S . So, to determine the distribution of \u03c4 c for large\n\n\u03c4 c , we need to calculate the distribution P( S , u n ) of S , given u n . Following the\n0\n\n0\n\nargument outlined before, the distribution P( S , u n0 ) can be directly read off from Eq.\n(14) after the substitutions t f = (n f \u2212 n0 )\u2206t = (n f \u2212 n0 ) / n0 and y n \u2261 y (t ) = u n / n0 ,\nafter first noting that\n\nn\n\nn\n\ntf\n\nf\n2 f\n2\n2 3/ 2\n2 3/ 2\nS = \u2211 un =\nn0 \u2211 y n \u2248 n0 \u222b y (t \u2032) dt \u2032 = n0 A .\ng n= n0\ng\ng\ng\nn = n0\n0\n\n13\n\n(20)\n\n\fUsing Eq. (14), we then get\n\n\u239b 4u n 3 \u239e\n0\n\u239f\nP ( S , u n0 ) \u2248 c1 4 / 3 exp\u239c \u2212\n\u239c\n\u239f\n9\ngS\nS\n\u239d\n\u23a0\nu n0\n\nwhere c1 = ( 23 )\n\n2/3\n\n(21)\n\n/[\u0393( 13 )g 1 / 3 ] . For large S this distribution has an algebraic tail\n\nP( S , u n0 ) \u2248 c1\n\nu n0\nS 4/3\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nAveraging over u n0 and using \u03c4 c \u2248 S for large \u03c4 c , we get\n\nP (\u03c4 c ) \u2248 c1\n\nu n0\n\n\u03c4 c4/3\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nOnce again, the exponent 4/3 is universal since it comes from the continuous\nBrownian motion and is independent of the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) .\n\nNoting that the same nonuniversal quantity u n0\n\nappears in the amplitude of the\n\ntails of both the distributions P (n f ) in Eq. (19) and P (\u03c4 c ) in Eq. (23), we find that\nthe amplitude ratio,\n\nlim\u03c4 c \u2192\u221e \u03c4 c\n\n4/3\n\nP(\u03c4 c )\n\n\u239b2\u239e\n=\u239c \u239f\n\u03b6 =\n3/ 2\nlim n f \u2192\u221e n f P(n f ) \u239d 3 \u23a0\n\n2/3\n\n2\u03c0\n[\u0393 ( ) g 1 / 3 ]\n1\n3\n\n14\n\n(24)\n\n\fis a universal number independent of the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) , providing that this\ndistribution is continuous and symmetric.\n\nIII. INELASTIC CASE\n\nWe now turn to the sequence in Eq. (2) with 0 < r < 1 . As before, the sequence\nstarts from the initial value u0 > 0 and we want to compute two quantities: (i) the\ndistribution P (n f ) of the number of flights before the collapse, i.e., before the\nvelocity becomes negative for the first time, and (ii) the distribution P (\u03c4 c ) of the total\ntime \u03c4 c =\n\n2\ng\n\n\u2211\n\nnf\nn =0\n\nu n elapsed before the collapse.\n\nUnlike the elastic case r = 1 , these two distributions are generically nonuniversal\nfor r < 1 and depend quite explicitly on the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) [18]. The\nprobability Q(n, u 0 ) that the sequence does not become negative up to step n , starting\nwith u 0 at n = 0 , satisfies the integral equation\n\n\u221e\n\nQ (n, u 0 ) = \u222b Q (n \u2212 1, u \u2032) \u03c1 (u \u2032 \u2212 ru 0 ) du \u2032\n\n(25)\n\n0\n\nwith the initial condition, Q(0, u0 ) = 1 for all u0 > 0 . This equation appeared recently\nin the context of the persistence of a continuous stochastic process with discrete time\nsampling [24]. There, it was shown that Q(n, u0 ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b81 (r )n] for large n , where\nthe decay exponent \u03b81 (r ) depends continuously on r and also on the form of the\n\n15\n\n\fnoise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) . Thus, P (n f ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b81 (r )n f ] for large n f . For the special\ncase of Gaussian noise \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b7 2 / 2) , various methods have been developed\n\nto determine the decay constant \u03b81 (r ) accurately, though an exact explicit solution is\nstill missing [24]. In an Appendix, we show how to explicitly determine \u03b81 (r ) for the\nexponentially distributed noise \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) = 12 exp(\u2212 \u03b7 ) , although the analysis is far from\neasy. The calculation of the collapse time distribution P (\u03c4 c ) is even harder. However,\none expects that P (\u03c4 c ) also has a similar exponential tail, P(\u03c4 c ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b8 2 (r )\u03c4 c ] for\nlarge \u03c4 c where the decay exponent \u03b8 2 (r ) is also nonuniversal.\n\nIn the elastic case r = 1 , both P (n f ) and P (\u03c4 c ) have power law tails. This means\nthat both the decay exponents \u03b81 (r ) and \u03b8 2 (r ) , characterizing the exponential tails\nfor r < 1 , must vanish as one approaches the elastic limit r \u2192 1 . We show later in this\nsection that these two exponents vanish in a universal fashion in the limit r \u2192 1 :\n\n\u03b81 (r ) \u2248 a (1 \u2212 r ) and \u03b8 2 (r ) \u2248 bg (1 \u2212 r ) 3 / 2 , where a = 1 and b = 0.405024... are\nuniversal constants independent of the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) . The reason for this\nuniversality can be traced to the fact that in the limit r \u2192 1 , the discrete sequence in\nEq. (2) can be approximated by a continuous time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n\nA. Continuous time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\n\nConsider a stochastic process y(t) evolving via the continuous time OrnsteinUhlenbeck (OU) equation\n\n16\n\n\fdy\n= \u2212\u03bby + \u03be (t )\ndt\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03be (t ) is a zero mean white noise with correlator \u03be (t )\u03be (t \u2032) = \u03b4 (t \u2212 t \u2032) and the\nmotion starts at y (t = 0) = y 0 . This represents the Langevin equation of a particle\nmoving in a parabolic potential. We compute below the probability distributions of\nthe two quantities of interest: (i) the first-passage time t f at which the process first\ncrosses zero and (ii) the area swept out by the process till its first-passage time,\nA = \u222b y (t \u2032) dt \u2032 .\ntf\n\n0\n\nAs was the case with the ordinary Brownian motion studied in subsection II.A,\nwe first consider the general case where we compute the probability distribution\ntf\n\nP (T , y0 ) of the observable T = \u222b V [ y (t \u2032)] dt \u2032 . Using the same backward Fokker0\n\n~\nPlanck technique, it is straightforward to show that the Laplace transform P ( s, y0 )\n\nsatisfies the differential equation in y0 ,\n\n\u23a11 \u22022\n\u23a4~\n\u2202\n\u03bb\ny\n\u2212\nsV\n[\ny\n]\n\u2212\n\u23a2\n\u23a5 P ( s, y 0 ) = 0\n0\n0\n2\n\u2202y0\n\u23a3 2 \u2202y0\n\u23a6\n\n(27)\n\n~\n~\nwith the boundary conditions P ( s, y0 \u2192 0) = 1 and P ( s, y0 \u2192 \u221e) = 0 . To calculate the\n\nfirst-passage time distribution, we choose V [ y ] = 1 , so that T = t f . With V [ y 0 ] = 1 ,\nthe exact solution of Eq. (27) is given by,\n\n17\n\n\f2\nD ( y 2\u03bb )\n~\nP ( s , y 0 ) = e \u03bb y0 / 2 \u2212 s / \u03bb 0\nD\u2212 s / \u03bb (0)\n\n(28)\n\nwhere D p (z ) is the parabolic cylinder function of index p and argument z [16]. It is\nnot easy to invert the Laplace transform in Eq. (28) to obtain explicitly the firstpassage time distribution P(t f , y0 ) . However, there is an alternative way to obtain\nP(t f , y 0 ) . We note that P(t f , y0 ) = \u2212 dtd Q(t , y0 )\n\nt =t f\n\nwhere Q(t , y 0 ) is the probability\n\nthat the process does not cross zero up to time t , starting at y0 . An exact expression\nof the survival probability Q(t , y 0 ) is known, see e.g. [21, 24];\n\n\u239b y \u03bb e\u2212\u03bb t\nQ(t , y0 ) = erf \u239c\u239c 0\n\u22122\u03bb t\n\u239d 1\u2212 e\n\n\u239e\n\u239f.\n\u239f\n\u23a0\n\n(29)\n\nDifferentiating Eq.

Note that the decay coefficient \u03bb characterizing the exponential tail\ncan also be computed directly from the Laplace transform in Eq. (28). Thus, since one\ncan show that D\u2212 s / \u03bb (0) = \u03c0 2 s / 2 \u03bb / \u0393( 2s\u03bb + 12 ) , it follows that the Laplace transform in\nEq. (28) has poles at s = \u2212(2m + 1)\u03bb where m = 0,1, 2... . The smallest negative pole\n(corresponding to m = 0 ) is at s = \u2212\u03bb , which indicates that asymptotically for large\nt f , the distribution P(t f , y 0 ) ~ exp(\u2212\u03bb t f ) .\n\ntf\n\nWe next compute the distribution of the area A = \u222b y (t \u2032) dt \u2032 swept out by the\n0\n\nprocess till its first-passage time by choosing V [ y ] = y so that T = A .

Once again, it is hard to invert the\nLaplace transform in Eq. (32) exactly. However, we anticipate that asymptotically the\narea distribution has an exponential tail\n\nP ( A, y0 ) ~ exp(\u2212\u03b3 A) .\n\n(33)\n\nThe decay constant \u03b3 must equal the smallest negative pole of the Laplace transform\nin Eq.

Thus \u03b3 is the smallest positive root of the equation\n\n19\n\n\fD\u03b3 2 / 2 \u03bb3 (\u2212 2 \u03b3 \u03bb\u22123 / 2 ) = 0 .\n\n(34)\n\nHence, the scaled variable \u03c6 = \u03b3 \u03bb\u22123 / 2 / 2 satisfies the equation D\u03c6 2 (\u22122\u03c6 ) = 0 .\nNumerically, we find the smallest root, \u03c6 = 0.57279... which determines \u03b3 exactly,\n\n\u03b3 = 2\u03c6 \u03bb 3 / 2 = 0.810048...\u03bb 3 / 2 .\n\n(35)\n\nIt is difficult to determine the pre-factor in Eq. (33). However, knowledge of Eq. (35)\nis sufficient for the present purpose.\n\nB. The relationship between the discrete sequence\nand the continuous OU process\n\nIn this subsection, we show that as one approaches the elastic limit, r \u2192 1 , the\ndiscrete sequence in Eq. (2) can be approximated by the continuous OU process in Eq.\n(26) with \u03bb = 1 . This is subtle, since the elastic limit itself, when r = 1 , corresponds to\nEq. (26) with \u03bb = 0 . To see what is going on, we first note from Eq. (2) that as the\nprocess evolves one can derive the general result\n\nun\n\n2\n\n= 1 + r 2 u n\u22121\n\n2\n\n=\n\n1 \u2212 r 2n\n2\n+ r 2nu0 .\n2\n1\u2212 r\n\n(36)\n\nTherefore, for r < 1 and as n \u2192 \u221e , the velocity distribution tends to evolve towards a\nstationary distribution characterised by a second moment which also approaches its\n\n20\n\n\fstationary value, u n\n\n2\n\n\u2192 1 /(1 \u2212 r 2 ) . Thus in the limit \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 r \u2192 0 , the typical value\n\nof the velocity in its stationary state becomes large, u n ~ 1 / \u03b5 . It also follows from\nEq. (36) that the number of steps n0 needed for the system to reach this stationary\nstate diverges as \u03b5 \u2192 0 , n0 ~ 1 / \u03b5 . This suggests that we define a scaled variable,\ny n = u n \u03b5 which will also be of O(1) for n \u2265 n0 for the process which is constrained\n\nto be positive up to n0 >> 1 . Note that \u03b5 plays a similar role as 1 / n0 in subsection\nII.B. For n > n0 , the variable y n evolves via the recursion,\n\ny n \u2212 y n\u22121 = \u2212\u03b5 y n\u22121 + \u03b5 \u03b7 n\n\n(37)\n\nstarting at y n0 = u n0 \u03b5 at n = n0 . The rest follows as in subsection II.B. We choose\n\u2206t = \u03b5 which is small in the elastic limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 , and hence t = (n \u2212 n0 )\u2206t becomes a\n\ncontinuous 'time' variable. Writing y n \u2261 y (t = (n \u2212 n0 )\u2206t ) , dividing Eq. (37) by\n\u2206t = \u03b5 and taking the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 , we find that y (t ) becomes an OU process as in\n\nEq. (26) with \u03bb = 1 and \u03be (t ) = \u03b7 n / \u03b5 = \u03b7 n / \u2206t . Thus, for n > n0 (where n0 ~ 1 / \u03b5 is\nlarge), we expect that the results for the discrete sequence can be obtained from those\nof the continuous process.\n\nFor example, the probability P (n f , u n0 ) that the ball undergoes n f flights before\nit collapses, for n f > n0 , can be read off from the corresponding continuous result in\nEqs. (30) and (31) after substituting t f = (n f \u2212 n0 )\u2206t = (n f \u2212 n0 )\u03b5 , y n0 = u n0 \u03b5 and\n\n\u03bb = 1 . For n f >> n0 , the distribution decays exponentially,\n\n21\n\n\fP(n f , u n0 ) \u2248\n\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\nu n0 \u03b5 3 / 2 exp(\u2212\u03b5 n f ) .\n\n(38)\n\nAs explained earlier, in general for any r < 1 , we expect P (n f ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b81 (r ) n f ] for\nlarge n f . The result in Eq. (38) shows that in the elastic limit r \u2192 1 , \u03b81 (r ) \u2192 \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 r\nindependent of the noise distribution.\n\nIn a similar way, one can find the tail of the distribution P (\u03c4 c ) of the total time\n\n\u03c4c =\n\n2\ng\n\n\u2211\n\nnf\nn =0\n\nu n , elapsed till the collapse, knowing the tail of the area distribution in\n\nEq. (33). The steps are very similar to those in subsection II.B, except for the fact that\none replaces n0 by 1 / \u03b5 . For example, as in Eq. (20), we find that for large \u03c4 c ,\n\n\u03c4 c \u2248 S \u2248 g2 \u03b5 \u22123 / 2 A where A is the area swept out by the continuous OU process till its\nfirst-passage time. Using the asymptotic distribution of A in Eq. (33) and substituting\n\n\u03bb = 1 , we then find that for large \u03c4 c\n\n\u23a1 1\n\u23a4\nP (\u03c4 c ) ~ exp \u23a2\u2212\n\u03c6 g\u03b5 3 / 2\u03c4 c \u23a5\n2\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03c6 = 0.57279... is smallest positive root of D\u03c6 2 (\u22122\u03c6 ) = 0 . Since, for generic\nr < 1 , P(\u03c4 c ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b8 2 (r )\u03c4 c ] , we find from Eq. (39) that the decay constant \u03b8 2 (r )\nvanishes in the elastic limit r \u2192 1 in the following fashion,\n\n\u03b8 2 (r ) \u2248 bg (1 \u2212 r ) 3 / 2\n\n(40)\n\n22\n\n\fwhere b = \u03c6 / 2 = 0.405024... is the smallest positive root of D2b 2 (\u22122 2b) = 0 , and\nis a universal constant independent of the noise distribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) .\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe relevance of the analysis in this paper in the context of the wider study of\ninelastic collapse may be summarised thus: Inelastic collapse persists in the presence\nof noise with features that are broadly universal when the coefficient of restitution is\nclose to unity. In the highly complex world of real granular materials [1-3] this gives\ncomfort in the pursuit of simple descriptions of the way such materials behave.\nAlthough the model studied is simplistic, and may be refined in many ways,\nparticularly with regard to the precise interaction between ball and platform when\nboth have comparable velocities, we believe the global features observed are broadly\ncorrect and will withstand more detailed scrutiny. That is not to say that a more\nthorough investigation would not be welcome or desirable.\n\nWe conclude by briefly considering the distribution of the maximum value, M ,\nattained by the process given by Eq. (2) during a first passage. This is actually quite\nstraightforward to compute and provides a different perspective on the collapse\ntransition. We first consider the continuous process Eq. (26) with initial condition\ny (t = 0) = y 0 on the interval [0, L] and with absorbing barriers at y = 0 and y = L .\nLet P0 ( L, y0 ) be the probability that the process is absorbed at y = 0 . Then P0 ( L, y0 )\nis equivalent to the probability that y (t ) does not reach L during its first passage, i.e.\n\n23\n\n\fP0 ( L, y0 ) = P ( y m < L y0 ) where y m = max{ y (t ) : 0 \u2264 t < t f } . It follows using a well-\n\nknown result that [25]\n\n\u23a11 \u22022\n\u2202 \u23a4\n\u2212 \u03bb y0\n\u23a2\n\u23a5 P0 ( L, y0 ) = 0\n2\n2\n\u2202\ny\n\u2202\ny\n0\u23a6\n0\n\u23a3\n\n(41)\n\nwith boundary conditions P0 ( L, y0 = 0) = 1 and P0 ( L, y0 = L) = 0 . This equation is\neasily solved,\n\nP0 ( L, y0 ) = 1 \u2212\n\nF ( y0 )\n;\nF ( L)\n\ny\n\nF ( y ) \u2261 \u222b e \u03bb x dx .\n2\n\n(42)\n\n0\n\nThe probability density, P ( y m , y0 ) , for the maximum value y m is given by evaluating\n\nP ( y m , y0 ) = \u2202P0 ( L, y0 ) / \u2202L L= y . Let us now consider the discrete problem for the\nm\n\nelastic case with r = 1 . Setting \u03bb = 0 one finds that P( y m , y0 ) = y 0 / y m for y m \u2265 y0 .\n2\n\nFollowing the procedure described in subsection II.B., the tail of the discrete\ndistribution is then given by P ( M ) ~ M \u22122 . For the inelastic case with r < 1 , one sets\n\n\u03bb = 1 and follows the procedure described in subsection III.B. The tail of the discrete\ndistribution when \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 r is small is then given by P( M ) ~ exp(\u2212\u03b5 M 2 ) . Thus the\nvelocity of the ball during the inelastic collapse process is unlikely to attain at any\ntime a value significantly greater than ~ 1 / \u03b5 .\n\n24\n\n\fAPPENDIX: EXPLICIT RESULTS FOR THE EXPONENTIAL\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nIn this Appendix we consider the discrete sequence u n = ru n\u22121 + \u03b7 n , with an\nexponential noise distribution, \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) = 12 exp(\u2212 \u03b7 ) . The aim is to present an explicit\ncalculation of the decay constant \u03b81 (r ) , characterizing the exponential tail of the\ndistribution of the number of flights till the collapse, P(n f ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b81 (r )n f ] for large\nn f . The analysis complements and adds to that provided in [18]. To proceed, let us\ndefine Pn (u u 0 ) to be the probability that the velocity after the n-th collision is u ,\ngiven that the velocities after all the preceding (n \u2212 1) collisions had been positive and\nthat the initial velocity is u 0 . Clearly, Pn (u u 0 ) satisfies the following recursion,\n\n\u221e\n\nPn (u u 0 ) =\n\n1\n\u2212 u \u2212 ru \u2032\nPn\u22121 (u \u2032 u 0 ) e\ndu \u2032\n\u222b\n20\n\n(A1)\n\nstarting from the initial condition, P0 (u u 0 ) = \u03b4 (u \u2212 u 0 ) . Knowing Pn (u u 0 ) one can\nthen calculate Q(n, u 0 ) , the probability that there is no collapse till the n-th step, by\n\u221e\n\nintegrating over all possible velocities at the n-th step, Q(n, u 0 ) = \u222b Pn (u u0 ) du . The\n0\n\ndistribution of the number of flights before the collapse is then simply,\nP(n f , u 0 ) = Q(n f \u2212 1, u 0 ) \u2212 Q(n f , u 0 ) . Thus, to derive the tail behaviour of P(n f , u 0 )\nfor large n f , we just need to know the solution of Eq. (A1) for large n . One expects\nthat asymptotically for large n , Pn (u u 0 ) \u2192 \u03c1 n f (u ) [24], where the information\n\n25\n\n\fabout u 0 is contained in the proportionality constant. Substituting this asymptotic\nform into Eq. (A1), one obtains an integral-eigenvalue equation for f (u ) ,\n\n\u03c1f (u ) =\n\n\u221e\n\n1\n\u2212 u \u2212 ru \u2032\nf (u \u2032) e\ndu \u2032\n\u222b\n20\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere the eigenvalue \u03c1 (r ) depends continuously on r .\n\nThis integral equation can be transformed, on differentiating twice with respect to\nu , into a differential equation\n\n\u239b d2\n\u239e\n1\n\u2212 1\u239f\u239f f (u ) = \u2212\n2\nr\n\u239d du\n\u23a0\n\n\u03c1 \u239c\u239c\n\n\u239bu\u239e\nf \u239c \u239f\u03b8 (u ) .\n\u239dr\u23a0\n\n(A3)\n\nFor u < 0 , the right hand side vanishes and one easily gets the solution\n\nf (u ) = Ae u\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere A is an arbitrary constant and we have used the physical boundary condition,\nf (u \u2192 \u2212\u221e) = 0 . For u > 0 , the right hand side of Eq. (A3) represents a nonlocal term\nand the solution is nontrivial. The form of Eq. (A3), however, suggests one seeks a\nsolution of the form f (u ) = \u2211m=0 cm e \u2212u / r\n\u221e\n\nm\n\nfor u > 0 . This ansatz indeed satisfies Eq.\n\n(A3) provided the coefficient cm satisfies the recursion, cm = cm\u22121 /[ \u03c1 r (1 \u2212 r \u22122 m )] .\n\n26\n\n\fIterating this recursion, we can express every cm with m > 0 in terms of a single\nconstant c0 . The solution for u > 0 is then given by\n\nm\n\u221e\n\u23a1\n\u23a1\nr 2 k \u23a4 \u2212u / r m \u23a4\nf (u ) = c0 \u23a2e \u2212u + \u2211 \u23a2(\u2212 \u03c1r ) \u2212m \u220f\ne\n\u23a5.\n2k \u23a5\n)\u23a6\nm =1 \u23a3\nk =1 (1 \u2212 r\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\n(A5)\n\nWe then need to match the solutions for u < 0 in Eq. (A4) and u > 0 in Eq. (A5) at\nu = 0 , i.e., the function f (u ) and its first derivative df / du must be continuous at\nu = 0 . The first condition determines c0 in terms of A . The second condition\n\ndetermines \u03c1 (r ) which is given by the largest positive root of the equation\n\n\u221e\n\nm\n\nm =1\n\nk =1\n\n2 + \u2211 (\u2212 \u03c1r ) \u2212m (1 + r m )\u220f\n\nr 2k\n= 0.\n(1 \u2212 r 2 k )\n\n(A6)\n\nAs pointed out in [18], expressions of this type may be written in an alternative form\nusing identities known from the theory of q-series. Thus, one can rewrite Eq. (A6) as\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\nn =0\n\nn =0\n\n\u220f (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u22121r 2n+1 ) + \u220f (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u22121r 2n ) = 0 .\n\n(A7)\n\nUsing the q-product notation, (t , q ) \u221e \u2261 \u220fn=0 (1 \u2212 tq n ) , this can in turn be written\n\u221e\n\nsuccinctly as\n\n( \u03c1 \u22121r , r 2 ) \u221e + ( \u03c1 \u22121 , r 2 ) \u221e = 0 .\n\n(A8)\n\n27\n\n\fClearly, when r = 0 the solution of Eq. (A7) is \u03c1 = 1 / 2 , which is expected since the\nvelocities are uncorrelated and the probability of u n not changing sign is just (1 / 2) n .\nMore generally, it is evident by inspection of Eq. (A7) that r \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1 , so it follows that\n\n\u03c1 (r = 1) = 1 . For any arbitrary value 0 < r < 1 , one can easily determine \u03c1 (r )\nnumerically. Thus, for example, one finds \u03c1 (0.2) = 0.588203... , \u03c1 (0.4) = 0.670041... ,\n\n\u03c1 (0.5) = 0.712667... , \u03c1 (0.6) = 0.757826... , \u03c1 (0.8) = 0.860729... etc.\n\nSince Pn (u u 0 ) ~ [ \u03c1 (r )]n f (u ) for large n , we get Q(n, u 0 ) ~ [ \u03c1 (r )]n as n \u2192 \u221e .\nThis implies that the distribution of the number of flights P(n f , u 0 ) ~ exp[\u2212\u03b81 (r )n f ]\nfor large n f where\n\n\u03b81 (r ) = \u2212 ln[ \u03c1 (r )]\n\n(A9)\n\nwith \u03c1 (r ) obtainable from Eq. (A7) as indicated. Thus, for the special noise\ndistribution \u03c1 (\u03b7 ) = 12 exp(\u2212 \u03b7 ) , it is possible to obtain \u03b81 (r ) to arbitrary accuracy for\nall 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1 . Since \u03c1 (r ) \u2192 1 as r \u2192 1 it follows that \u03b81 (r ) vanishes when r = 1 . To\nexamine how, let us consider the function h(t , q) \u2261 (t , q 2 ) \u221e /(tq, q 2 ) \u221e . It is easy to see\nby cancelling factors that the function h(t , q) satisfies the functional equation\n\nh(t , q)h(tq, q) = 1 \u2212 t . By taking logarithms and expanding ln h(t , q) as a power series\nin t one finds a formal solution [18] from which one may show as q \u21921\u2212 that,\n\n1/ 2\n\n1 \u2212 t \u239b ln t\n1\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\nh(t , q ) ~\n+ \u239f\u239f\n1 \u2212 tq \u239d 2 ln q 2 \u23a0\n\n\u0393( 2lnlntq + 12 )\n\u0393( 2lnlntq + 1)\n\n28\n\n.\n\n(A10)\n\n\fWe now note that one can write Eq. (A8) as h( \u03c1 \u22121 , r ) = \u22121 . By setting t = \u03c1 \u22121 and\nq = r in Eq. (A10) and setting the right hand side of Eq. (A10) equal to \u2212 1 , it follows\nthat \u03c1 (r ) \u2248 r + 2 / \u03c0 (1 \u2212 r ) 3 / 2 + ... as r \u2192 1 . By invoking Eq. (A9) it then follows in\nturn that \u03b81 (r ) \u2248 1 \u2212 r \u2212 2 / \u03c0 (1 \u2212 r ) 3 / 2 + ... as r \u2192 1 . This supports the more general\nclaim in the main text that \u03b81 (r ) \u2248 1 \u2212 r as r \u2192 1 irrespective of the noise distribution.\n\n29\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n[1]\n\nH.M. Jaeger, S.R.
