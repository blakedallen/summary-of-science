Our main theorem shows that if a curve is knotted then it has a nonempty second hull. This provides\na new proof of the F\u00e1ry/Milnor theorem that every knotted curve has total curvature at least 4\u03c0.\n\nA space curve must loop around at least twice to become\nknotted. This intuitive idea was captured in the celebrated\nF\u00e1ry/Milnor theorem, which says the total curvature of a knotted curve K is at least 4\u03c0. We prove a stronger result: that\nthere is a certain region of space doubly enclosed, in a precise\nsense, by K. We call this region the second hull of K.\nThe convex hull of a connected set K is characterized by\nthe fact that every plane through a point in the hull must interesect K. If K is a closed curve, then a generic plane intersects K an even number of times, so the convex hull is the set\nof points through which every plane cuts K twice. Extending\nthis, we introduce a definition which measures the degree to\nwhich points are enclosed by K: a point p is said to be in the\nnth hull of K if every plane through p intersects K at least 2n\ntimes.\nA space curve is convex and planar if and only if it has\nthe two-piece property: every plane cuts it into at most two\npieces. This has been generalized by Kuiper (among others;\nsee [CC97]) in the study of tight and taut submanifolds. It was\nMilnor [Mil50] who first observed that for a knotted curve,\nthere are planes in every direction which cut it four times.\nOur main theorem strengthens this to find points through\nwhich every plane cuts the knot four times. More precisely,\nit says that any curve K with a knotted inscribed polygon (in\nparticular any knotted curved of finite total curvature) has a\nnonempty second hull, as shown for a trefoil in Figure 1. Furthermore, in a certain sense, this hull must extend across the\nknot: Using quadrisecants, we get an alternate approach to\nsecond hulls, and in particular we show that the second hull\nof a generic prime knot K is not contained in any embedded\nnormal tube around K.\nWe use some ideas from integral geometry to show that the\ntotal curvature of a space curve with nonempty nth hull is at\nleast 2\u03c0 n. Thus, our theorem provides an alternate proof of\nthe F\u00e1ry/Milnor theorem.\nWe do not yet know any topological knot type which is\nguaranteed to have a nonempty third hull, though we suspect\nthat this is true for the (3,4)\u2013torus knot (see Figure 5). It would\n\nFigure 1: This figure shows the second hull of a trefoil knot, the\nshaded region in the center of the knot, from two perspectives. Every\nplane which intersects second hull must cut the knot at least four\ntimes. The trefoil shown here is a polygonal approximation to the\ncritical point-and presumed minimizer-for the M\u00f6bius-invariant\nknot energy of Freedman, He and Wang [FHW94]. The region shown\nis an accurate computation of the second hull of this polygonal knot,\nproduced by John Foreman. The sharp edges remind us that second\nhulls, like convex hulls, need not be as smooth as the curves which\ngenerate them.\n\nbe interesting to find, for n \u2265 3, computable topological invariants of knots which imply the existence of nonempty nth\nhulls.\nOur definition of higher hulls is appropriate only for curves,\nthat is, for one-dimensional submanifolds of Rd . Although we\ncan imagine similar definitions for higher-dimensional submanifolds, we have had no reason yet to investigate these. For\n0-dimensional submanifolds, that is, finite point sets X \u2282 Rd ,\nCole, Sharir and Yap [CSY87] introduced the notion of the\nk-hull of X, which is the result of removing from Rd all halfspaces containing fewer than k points of X. Thus it is the\nset of points p for which every closed half-space with p in the\nboundary contains at least k points of X. Although we did\nnot know of their work when we first formulated our definition, our higher hulls for curves are similar in spirit.\n\n1.\n\nDEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS\n\n\u2217 Email:\n\ncantarel@math.uga.edu\ngreg@math.ucdavis.edu\n\u2021 Email: kusner@math.umass.edu\n\u00a7 Email: jms@math.uiuc.edu\n\u2020 Email:\n\nDefinition. Let K be a closed curve in Rd , by which we mean\na continuous map from the circle, modulo reparametrization.\nThe nth hull hn (K) of K is the set of points p \u2208 Rd such that\n\n\f2\nK cuts every hyperplane through p at least 2n times, where\nnontransverse intersections are counted according to the conventions below.\nHere, we basically count the intersections of K with a\nplane P by counting the number of components of the pullback of K \u2229 P to the domain circle. If the intersections are\ntransverse, then (thinking of P as horizontal, and orienting\nK) we find equal numbers of upward and downward intersections; the total number of intersections (if nonzero) equals\nthe number of components of K r P (again counted in the\ndomain).\nTo handle nontransverse intersections, we again orient K\nand we adopt the following conventions. First, if K \u2282 P , we\nsay K cuts P twice (once in either direction). If K \u2229 P has\ninfinitely many components, then we say K cuts P infinitely\noften. Otherwise, each connected component of the intersection is preceded and followed by open arcs in K, with each\nlying to one side of P . An upward intersection will mean a\ncomponent of K \u2229 P preceded by an arc below P or followed\nby an arc above P . (Similarly, a downward intersection will\nmean a component preceded by an arc above P or followed\nby an arc below P .) A glancing intersection, preceded and\nfollowed by arcs on the same side of P , thus counts twice, as\nboth an upward and a downward intersection.\nWith these conventions, it is easy to see that an arc whose\nendpoints are not in a plane P intersects P an even number\nof times if the endpoints are on the same side of P and an\nodd number of times otherwise. For a closed curve, there are\nalways equal numbers of intersections in each direction.\nWe will later apply the same definition to disconnected\ncurves L, like links. In that context, of course, the number\nof intersections of L with P cannot simply be counted as the\nnumber of components of L r P .\n2.\n\nTHE SECOND HULL OF A KNOTTED CURVE\n\nIn order to prove that any knot has a second hull, we start\nwith some basic lemmas about nth hulls.\nLemma 1. For any curve K, each connected component of its\nnth hull hn (K) is convex. Furthermore, hn (K) \u2282 hn\u22121 (K).\nProof. Let C be a connected component of hn (K). If q is a\npoint in its convex hull, then by connectedness, any plane P\nthrough q must meet C at some point p. Thus P is also a plane\nthrough p \u2208 C \u2282 hn (K), so P meets K at least 2n times. By\ndefinition, then, q \u2208 hn (K). The second part of the statement\nthen follows from the definition of hn .\nA useful lemma allows us to simplify a given curve, with\ncontrol on its higher hulls.\nLemma 2. Let K \u2217 be the result of replacing some subarc \u0393\nof K by the straight segment S connecting its endpoints p, q.\nNo plane cuts K \u2217 more often than it cuts K, so hn (K \u2217 ) \u2282\nhn (K).\nProof. Let P be any plane. If K \u2217 \u2229 P has infinitely many\ncomponents then so does K \u2229 P . So we may assume K \u2217 \u2229 P\n\nhas only a finite number of components. The generic case\nis when p, q \u2208\n/ P . If they are on the same side of P , then\nS misses P and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, S has\na unique intersection with P , but \u0393 must also have cut P at\nleast once.\nThe other cases require us to invoke our conventions for\ncounting intersections, and thus require a bit more care. First\nsuppose p, q \u2208 P . If K \u2217 \u2282 P , this counts as two intersections, but by our conventions K cuts P a nonzero even number of times, hence at least twice. Otherwise, let A be the\ncomponent of K \u2217 \u2229 P containing S. It counts as one or two\nintersections with P , depending on whether points just before\nand after A are on different sides of P or the same side. But\nthe corresponding arc of K then cuts P a nonzero odd or even\nnumber of times respectively, hence at least as often as A does.\nNext, suppose p \u2208 P and q is above P . Let A be the component of K \u2229 P containing p, and consider the arc of K from\na point r just before A to q. This arc cuts P a nonzero odd or\neven number of times if r is below or above P , but then the\ncorresponding arc in K \u2217 intersects P once or twice, respectively.\nIn any case, K \u2217 has at most as many intersections as K did\nwith the arbitrary plane P . The final statement of the lemma\nthen follows from the definition of hn .\nWe will need to locate regions of space which can be said\nto contain the knottedness of K.\nDefinition. We say that an (open) half-space H essentially\ncontains a knot K if it contains K, except for possibly a single\npoint or a single unknotted arc.\nNote that if H essentially contains K, then K cuts \u2202H at\nmost twice. Thus, we can clip K to H, replacing the single\narc (if any) outside H by the segment in \u2202H connecting its\nendpoints. The resulting knot clH (K) is isotopic to K, and is\ncontained in H.\nOur key lemma now shows that essential half-spaces remain essential under clipping:\nLemma 3. Let K \u2217 := clH (K) be the clipping of a knot K\nto some half-space H which essentially contains it. Then any\nhalf-space H \u2032 which essentially contains K will also essentially contain K \u2217 .\nProof. We must show that either H \u2032 contains K \u2217 , or the single\narc of this new knot outside H \u2032 is unknotted. If H \u2032 contains\nK then, since K \u2217 lies within the convex hull of K, H \u2032 must\ncontain K \u2217 , and we are done.\nOtherwise, consider the single arc of K outside H \u2032 , and\ncount how many of its endpoints are outside H. The different cases are illustrated in Figure 2. If both endpoints are\noutside H, again we find H \u2032 contains K \u2217 . If neither is, the\nunknotted arc of K outside H \u2032 has an unknotted subarc outside H, which gets replaced with an isotopic segment in \u2202H.\nSo the arc of K \u2217 outside H \u2032 is unknotted, as desired.\nFinally, we must consider the case where one endpoint of\nthe arc is within H and one is outside H. This implies that\nthe half-spaces are not nested, but divide space into four quadrants, with K winding once around their intersection line. The\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2: This figure shows the three cases of interest in the proof of Lemma 3. On the left, we see the case where both intersections of K\nwith \u2202H \u2032 occur outside H. In the center, we see the case where both intersections of K with \u2202H \u2032 occur inside H. On the right, we see the\ncase where K intersects \u2202H \u2032 once inside and once outside H. In each figure, the segments in \u2202H and \u2202H \u2032 replacing unknotted subarcs of K\nwhen K is clipped to these planes are drawn in lightly. The half-space H is below the horizontal plane \u2202H, while the half-space H \u2032 is to the\nleft of the vertical plane \u2202H \u2032 .\n\nknot K is a connect sum of four arcs, in these quadrants. The\nsum of the two arcs outside H is trivial, as is the sum of the\ntwo outside H \u2032 . So in fact all the knotting happens in the one\nquadrant H \u2229 H \u2032 . But now, the arc of K \u2217 outside H \u2032 consists\nof the original unknotted arc in one quadrant, plus a straight\nsegment within \u2202H; thus it is unknotted.\n\nhalf-space H \u2032 which essentially contains K. This completes\nthe proof of the claim.\nSince planes through A cut K four times, A \u2282 h2 (K) \u2282\nh1 (K), and we can write\n\\\n\u0001\nA=\nH \u2229 h1 (K) .\nH\n\nFor the proof of our theorem, we will need to decompose\na knot into its prime pieces, but only when this can be done\nwith a flat plane.\nDefinition. We say that a knot K in R3 is geometrically composite if there is a plane P (cutting K twice) which decomposes K into two nontrivial connect summands. Otherwise,\nwe say K is geometrically prime. Note that a (topologically)\nprime knot is necessarily geometrically prime.\nMain Theorem. If K is any space curve with a knotted inscribed polygon, then its second hull h2 (K) is nonempty.\nProof. We can replace K by the knotted inscribed polygon,\nand by Lemma 2 its second hull can only shrink. If K is now\ngeometrically composite, we can replace it by one of its two\nsummands, and by Lemma 2 again its second hull will only\nshrink. Because the polygonal K is tame, we need only do\nthis a finite number of times, and so we may assume that K is\ngeometricallyTprime.\nLet A := H H be the intersection of the closures of all\nthe half-spaces H essentially containing K. We claim that\nany plane P through a point p in A cuts K at least four times.\nIf not, P would cut K twice. Because K is geometrically\nprime, P cannot split K into two nontrivial summands. So\nP must be the boundary of an essential half-space H. We\nwill construct a parallel half-space H \u2032 strictly contained in H\nwhich still essentially contains K. Since p \u2208\n/ H \u2032 and p \u2208 A,\nthis is a contradiction.\nIf K is not contained in H, there are two edges of K which\nstart in H but end outside H (possibly on P ). Let v and w\nbe their endpoints in H, and \u0393 be the subarc of K between v\nand w in H. If K \u2282 H, let \u0393 = K. In either case, \u0393 is a\ncompact subset of H, and so is contained in a smaller parallel\n\nThis exhibits A as an infinite intersection of compact sets. To\nshow it is nonempty, it suffices to prove that any finite intersection is nonempty (using the finite intersection property\nfor compact sets). So suppose H1 , . . . , HN are half-spaces\nessentially containing K. Clipping the knot successively to\nthese half-spaces, we define K0 = K and Ki = clHi (Ki\u22121 ).\nSince K is essentially contained in every Hj , this is also true\ninductively for each of the Ki , using Lemma 3. Thus KN , a\nknot isotopic to K, is contained in\nN\n\\\n\nHi \u2229 h1 (K),\n\n1\n\nshowing this to be nonempty, as desired.\nNote that our sets H \u2229 h1 (K) are convex. Therefore, we\ncould appeal to Helly's theorem instead of the finite intersection property: as soon as any four of these compact convex\nsets have nonempty intersection, they all do. But the proof\ngiven above is no simpler for the special case N = 4.\nWe expect that the set A used in the proof is always a connected component of h2 (K). This essential piece A \u2282 h2 (K)\nis the intersection of all halfspaces essentially containing K,\njust as h1 (K) is the intersection of all halfspaces containing\nK. We note also that the only place we used the assumption\nabout polygons was to show that bounding planes of A must\ncut the knot four times, and thus that all of A, and not merely\nits (possibly empty) interior, is in h2 (K).\nUsing Milnor's definition of total curvature for arbitrary\ncurves, our theorem applies to any knot of finite total curvature:\nCorollary. A knotted space curve of finite total curvature has\nnonempty second hull.\n\n\f4\nProof. A lemma of Milnor [Mil50] shows that any curve of\nfinite total curvature has an isotopic inscribed polygon, so our\nmain theorem applies.\n3. LINKS\n\nIf we apply our definition of nth hull to links L, that is, to\nunions of closed curves in space, then it is no longer necessarily true that h1 (L) is the entire convex hull of L. However,\nLemma 1 shows that h1 (L) contains the convex hull of each\ncomponent. In Figure 3 we show an example where both inclusions are strict.\n\nFigure 3: This figure shows two round circles forming an unlink L\nin the plane. The convex hull of L is bounded by a stadium curve.\nIts first hull h1 (L), however, consists only of the hulls of the two\ncomponents along with the four shaded triangular regions. These are\nbounded by the four lines tangent to both circles.\n\nFor links we can easily find points in higher hulls by intersecting the hulls of different components. The next lemma is\nimmediate from the definitions:\nLemma 4. If A and B are links, then\nhm (A) \u2229 hn (B) \u2282 hm+n (A \u222a B)\nfor all m, n > 0.\nThis allows us to extend our theorem to the case of links.\nCorollary. Any nontrivial link (of finite total curvature) has a\nnonempty second hull.\nProof. If the link contains a knotted component, we use the\ntheorem. Otherwise it must contain two components A and B\nwhose convex hulls intersect, and we use the last lemma.\nFor a Hopf link whose two components are plane curves,\nLemma 4 is sharp: the second hull consists exactly of the segment along which the convex hulls of the components intersect. This shows that the second hull of a link can have zero\nvolume. We conjecture that this never happens for knots.\n4.\n\nCONE ANGLES\n\nWe originally became interested in second hulls while\nattempting to improve lower bounds on the ropelength of\n\nknots [CKS02]. We wanted to find points in space from which\na knot has large cone angle, or visual angle.\nLemma 5. If p \u2208 hn (K) then the cone from p to K has cone\nangle at least 2\u03c0n.\nProof. Consider the radial projection K \u2032 of K to the unit\nsphere around p. By the definition of hn , K \u2032 intersects each\ngreat circle at least 2n times. But the length of a spherical\ncurve, using integral geometry as in the proof of Fenchel's\ntheorem, equals \u03c0 times its average number of intersections\nwith great circles (see [Mil50]). Thus the length of K \u2032 , which\nis the cone angle of K at p, is at least 2\u03c0n.\nCorollary. If K is a nontrivial knot or link (of finite total\ncurvature), there is some point p from which K has cone angle\nat least 4\u03c0.\nFor our application to ropelength, however, we needed to\nknow more. If K has thickness \u03c4 , that is, if a normal tube of\nradius \u03c4 around K is embedded, then the cone point p can be\nchosen outside this tube. We will see below, using quadrisecants, that for generic prime knots, the second hull does extend outside this thick tube, as desired.\nHowever, a different argument gives 4\u03c0 cone points for arbitrary links: Brian White has a version of the monotonicity theorem for minimal surfaces with boundary [Whi96]. As\nhe points out in work with Ekholm and Wienholtz [EWW02,\nThm. 1.3], it shows directly that if we span K with a minimal surface, and p is a point where this surface intersects itself, then the cone angle from p to K is at least 4\u03c0. In fact,\nthis result was originally proved in 1983 by Gromov [Gro83,\nThm. 8.2.A].\nThe set of points from which the cone angle to a curve K is\nat least 2\u03c0 has been called the visual hull, and is a superset of\nthe convex hull. (See [Gro83, Gag80].) We might call the set\nwhere cone angle is at least 4\u03c0 the second visual hull; as we\nhave mentioned, this set contains our second hull. Gromov's\nresult, reproved by our corollary above, is that any knot has a\nnonempty second visual hull.\nWe have shown [CKS02] that if K is a thick knot, then the\nself-intersection curve of a minimal spanning disk must go\noutside the tube of radius \u03c4 , as shown in Figure 4, giving us\nwhat we needed: a point far from the knot with large cone\nangle. We note that self-intersection points of a minimal surface need not be in the second hull of its boundary curve, as\ndemonstrated by the second example in Figure 4, though they\nare necessarily in the second visual hull.\n5. BRIDGE NUMBER AND TOTAL CURVATURE\n\nWe can define the hull number of a link to be the largest n\nfor which the nth hull is nonempty (and the hull number of a\nlink type to be the minimum over all representatives). Perhaps\nsufficiently complicated link types have hull number greater\nthan two, but we know of no way to prove this. We can get an\neasy upper bound:\nProposition. The hull number of any link is bounded above\nby its bridge number.\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 5: This presumed M\u00f6bius-energy-minimizing configuration\n(from [KS97]) of the (3, 4)-torus knot 819 , has a small but nonempty\nthird hull. We do not know whether every configuration of 819 has\nnonempty third hull. This knot and the button knot 818 are the first\nprime 3-bridge knots in Rolfsen's table [Rol76]. As in Figure 1, we\nshow a numerical approximation of the third hull, and we expect that\nthe true hull is somewhat smoother.\n\nThe following lemma, which also appears in [EWW02],\nwhen combined with Lemma 5, gives yet another proof of\nF\u00e1ry/Milnor.\nLemma 6. The cone angle of a knot K, from any point, is at\nmost the total curvature of K.\nFigure 4: This figure shows two immersed minimal disks, one\nbounded by a trefoil knot and the other bounded by an unknot. By\nWhite's version of the monotonicity theorem for minimal surfaces,\nthe cone angle to the boundary from any point on the line of selfintersection of either disk is at least 4\u03c0. In the trefoil above, this line\nis contained within the second hull. For the unknotted curve below,\nthe second hull is empty, and so the line of self-intersections is in the\nsecond visual hull, but not in the second hull.\n\nProof. To say L is a link of bridge number n means there is\nsome height function with just n minima and n maxima. Thus\nL will have empty (n + 1)st hull, because it cuts no horizontal\nplane more than 2n times.\nNote that we don't always have equality, at least for composite links. For instance, the connect sum of two 2-bridge\nlinks (like Hopf links or trefoil knots) has bridge number\nthree. But obvious configurations, where each summand is\nin its 2-bridge presentation and they are well separated vertically, have empty third hull. Perhaps any prime 3-bridge\nknot has nonempty third hull as in Figure 5: certainly there\nare planes in every direction which are cut six times by the\nknot. To extend our proof to this case, we might need to consider the notion of thin position for knots, as introduced by\nGabai [Gab87] and studied by Thompson [Tho97].\nMilnor's version [Mil50] of the F\u00e1ry/Milnor theorem says\nthat the total curvature of a knot is greater than 2\u03c0 times its\nbridge number; by our proposition, the same is true replacing\nbridge number by hull number. Since our main theorem says\nhull number is at least two for a nontrivial knot, this provides\nan alternate proof of F\u00e1ry/Milnor.\n\nProof. Applying Gauss-Bonnet to the cone itself, we see that\nthe cone angle equals the total geodesic curvature of K in\nthe cone, which is no greater than the total curvature of K in\nspace.\nKuiper [Kui87] defined the superbridge number sb(K) of\na curve K as half the maximum number of times K cuts\nany plane. Like our notion of nth hull, this is invariant under affine transformations of the ambient space. Kuiper observed that the total curvature of K is bounded above by\n2\u03c0sb(K), and that there is a sequence of affine transformations of K (stretched in the direction perpendicular to any\nplane cut 2sb(K) times) whose total curvature approaches that\nlimit 2\u03c0sb(K). We note that, viewed from any point near the\ncenter of mass, these stretched curves also have cone angles\napproaching the same value 2\u03c0sb(K).\nF\u00e1ry's proof [F\u00e1r49] of the F\u00e1ry/Milnor theorem showed\nthat the total curvature of a space curve is the average total\ncurvature of its planar projections, and that any knot projection has total curvature at least 4\u03c0. In fact, his proof of the\nlatter statement actually showed that any knot projection has\nnonempty second hull.\nWhen we first started to think about second hulls, we rederived this result, not knowing F\u00e1ry's proof. We hoped that\nperhaps a curve whose projections all had nonempty second\nhulls would necessarily also have one, but never succeeded\nin this line of argument. The next lemma does give a sort of\nconverse, relating hulls and projections.\nLemma 7. If K is a closed curve in Rd , and \u03a0 is any orthogonal projection to Rd\u22121 , then \u03a0(hn (K)) \u2282 hn (\u03a0(K)).\n\n\f6\nProof. Call the projection direction \"vertical\". If P is a hyperplane in Rd\u22121 through p \u2208 \u03a0(hn (K)), then the vertical\nhyperplane \u03a0\u22121 P in Rd passes through a point in hn (K), so\nK cuts it 2n times. Thus \u03a0(K) cuts P at least 2n times.\n\nquadrisecant is essential if neither the mid-segment nor either\nend-segment is trivial.\n\nThis lemma explains why, for instance, the projected third\nhull in Figure 5 must lie entirely within the central bigon of\nthe knot projection.\n\n6.\n\nQUADRISECANTS AND SECOND HULLS\n\nAny knot or link in space has a quadrisecant, that is, a\nstraight line which intersects the link four times. This was\nfirst proved by Pannwitz [Pan33] for generic polygonal links;\nthe full result is due to Kuperberg [Kup94]. Quadrisecants can\nbe used to prove a thickened version of our theorem. In particular, the middle segment of a quadrisecant for K often lies\nin the second hull of K.\nIn the case of links, if there are two components A and\nB with nonzero linking number, Pannwitz [Pan33] (and later\nMorton and Mond [MM82]) showed that there is an ABAB\nquadrisecant, meaning one where the components are seen in\nthat order along the secant line. The entire mid-segment then\nlies in the intersection of the convex hulls of A and B, and\nthus in h2 (A \u222a B). For the thickened version, simply note\nthat this mid-segment starts inside the tube around A and ends\ninside the disjoint one around B, so it must leave the tubes\naltogether in the middle.\nFor knots, we can compare the linear ordering of the four\nintersection points (along the quadrisecant line) with their circular ordering (along the knot). Viewed from a point on the\nmid-segment of a quadrisecant, the four intersection points lie\n(two each) at the north and south poles of the visual sphere. If\nthese intersection points alternate between the north and south\npoles, we call the quadrisecant alternating. The mid-segment\nof an alternating quadrisecant for K will be contained in the\nsecond hull of K: if we project K to the unit sphere around a\npoint on the mid-segment, the projected curve cuts every great\ncircle four times, since it visits the poles in alternating order.\nThus the following conjecture would give an alternate proof\nof our main theorem.\nConjecture. Any nontrivial knot has an alternating quadrisecant.\nElizabeth Denne has already made good progress towards\nproving this conjecture as part of her doctoral dissertation at\nthe University of Illinois. She makes use of ideas from Pannwitz [Pan33], Kuperberg [Kup94] and Schmitz [Sch98].\nFor generic polynomial curves in prime knot classes, we\ncan prove a thickened version of our theorem using Kuperberg's notion of an essential (or \"topologically nontrivial\")\nquadrisecant [Kup94].\nDefinition. A secant S of K is trivial if its endpoints are on\nthe same component of K, dividing it into arcs X and Y , and\nif one of the two circles S \u222a X, S \u222a Y spans a disk whose\ninterior avoids K. The disk may intersect S and itself. A\n\nFigure 6: This figure shows an essential quadrisecant of a particular\nconfiguration of a trefoil knot. By Lemma 9, the mid-segment of\nthis quadrisecant is contained within the second hull of K. In fact,\nthis quadrisecant is alternating as well, so our earlier argument gives\nan alternate proof that the mid-segment is in the second hull of K.\nSince this is the same configuration of trefoil knot used in Figure 1,\nit is interesting to compare this picture with the image of the entire\nsecond hull.\n\nWe start by proving a lemma about secants of unknots.\nLemma 8. Let K be an unknot. Any secant of K is trivial on\neither side.\nProof. Suppose that S is a secant of K. Pick either one of the\narcs of K joining the endpoints of S. We will show that the\nclosed curve C formed by joining this arc to S bounds a disk\ndisjoint from K. We begin the disk by constructing an embedded ribbon bounded by C and a parallel curve, C \u2032 , chosen so\nthat the linking number of K and C \u2032 is zero. By the definition\nof linking number, this implies that C \u2032 is homologous to zero\nin the complement of K. Since K is the unknot, C \u2032 is therefore homotopic to zero in the complement of K. Thus, C \u2032\nbounds a disk disjoint from K. Joining this disk to the ribbon\ncompletes the proof.\nLemma 9. Let K be a geometrically prime knot. The midsegment of any essential quadrisecant for K is contained in\nthe second hull of K.\nProof. Let Q be a quadrisecant of K; if its mid-segment is\nnot contained in the second hull, there is a plane P that meets\nthe mid-segment of Q and meets K only twice. Because K\nis geometrically prime, it is trivial on one side of P . Let K \u2217\nbe the unknotted arc on this side, completed with a straight\nline segment in P . By Lemma 8, the end-segment S of Q on\nthis side is trivial with respect to K \u2217 . That is, S together with\none arc of K \u2217 bounds a disk D whose boundary is disjoint\nfrom P .\nBy design, D does not intersect K \u2217 , but it may cross P and\nintersect K r K \u2217 . We claim that we can simplify D so that it\ndoes not cross P . Thus the secant S of Q is inessential with\nrespect to K.\n\n\f7\n\nThe result of [Kup94] that a generic polynomial link has an\nessential quadrisecant, combined with these lemmas, proves\nthe thickened version of our theorem, for generic prime knots:\n\nIt follows that our definition applies in hyperbolic space H3 ,\nand that any knotted curve in H3 has a nonempty second hull:\nSimply embed hyperbolic space, in Klein's projective model,\nin a ball in R3 . Then the hyperbolic second hull of any curve\nis the Euclidean second hull of its image in the model.\nRecently, two proofs have been given showing that the\nF\u00e1ry/Milnor theorem holds for knots in any Hadamard manifold, that is, any simply connected manifold of nonpositive\ncurvature. Alexander and Bishop [AB98] find a sequence\nof inscribed polygons limiting to a quadruply covered segment, while Schmitz [Sch98] comes close to constructing a\nquadrisecant. Arguments like either of these could be used to\ngive alternate proofs of our theorem in Euclidean space.\nWe thus suspect that there should be some notion of second\nhull for curves in Hadamard manifolds. The problem is that\nthere is no natural way to extend our definition, because there\nis no analog of a plane in this general context. If some reasonable definition for second hull can be found so that Lemma 2\nremains true, then there should be no problem proving that\nknots have nonempty second hulls.\n\nTheorem. If K is a generic polynomial representative of a\nprime knot class, and T is an open embedded normal tube\naround K, then h2 (K) r T is nonempty.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nTo check the claim, consider D as a map from the standard disk to R3 . In general position, the inverse image of P\nis a collection of circles, and we can cut off the disk at the\noutermost circles. We know D is interior-disjoint from all of\nK \u2217 , including the line segment lying in P . But D may intersect P in a complicated loop L that encircles the pair of points\nK \u2229 P many times. In this case, after cutting D along this circle, we attach not a flat disk in P but instead a bigger disk that\navoids K.\nLemma 10. The mid-segment of an essential quadrisecant for\nK leaves any embedded normal tube around K.\nProof. If not, it would be isotopic within the tube to part of the\ncore curve, that is, to one arc of K, contradicting the definition\nof essential.\n\nWe have been assuming that our knots lie in Euclidean\nspace R3 . However, our notion of second hull is not a metric notion but rather a projective notion, depending only on\nincidence relations of planes.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge helpful conversations with\nmany colleagues, including Colin Adams, Stephanie Alexander, Dick Bishop, Elizabeth Denne, Herbert Edelsbrunner,\nMike Gage and Frank Morgan.
