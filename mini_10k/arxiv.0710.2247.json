Two point-like\nsources can be associated to two remarkable objects around \"Crab-like\" young and energetic pulsars in\nour Galaxy : G21.5-0.9 and Kes 75. The characteristics of each of the sources are presented and possible\ninterpretations are briefly discussed.\n\nIntroduction\nThe standard candle of VHE astronomy, the Crab\nNebula, has served for decades as a yardstick in almost all wavelengths, and yet it is a very peculiar\nobject, harbouring the most energetic and one of\nthe youngest pulsars of our Galaxy. Since the early\ndays, where the similarities of the historical trio\nCrab/3C 58/G 21.5-0.9 were under debate [19], radio and X-ray astronomy have provided a wealth of\ninformation by detecting and characterizing nebulae around rotation-powered pulsars. In the VHE\ndomain, H.E.S.S. has revealed more than a dozen\npulsar wind nebulae (PWN), either firmly established as such or compelling candidates [16], almost all of which are middle-aged (at least few\nkyrs up to \u223c100 kyrs, except MSH 15-52) and exhibit an offset between the pulsar position and the\nnebula center. We report here on the VHE emission discovery of two remarkable objects, G 21.50.9 and Kes75, which also harbor very young and\nenergetic pulsars and which on some aspects, especially their plerionic nebular emission due to an\nenergetic pulsar, can be considered as Crab-like.\nG21.5-0.9 [7], recently revealed as a composite\nSNR consisting of a centrally peaked PWN and a\n\n4\u2032 shell [8, 10], was previously classified as one\nof the about ten Crab-like SNR [4]. Its flat spectrum PWN is polarised in radio [2] with a spectral\nbreak above 500 GHz [20]. The non-thermal Xray PWN with radius \u223c40\u2032\u2032 shows significant evidence of cooling [18], with the power-law photon index steepening from 1.43\u00b10.02 near the pulsar to 2.13\u00b10.06 at the edge of the PWN. There\nappears to be a synchrotron X-ray halo at a radius of 140\u2032\u2032 from the pulsar which could originate in the shell [8, 10], with a contribution of\nscattering off dust grains as proposed by Bocchino\net al. [8]. The 61.8 ms pulsar PSR J1833-1034,\nwith a spin-down power of \u0116 = 3.3 \u00d7 1037 erg/s\nand a characteristic age of 4.9 kyr was discovered\nonly recently through its faint radio pulsed emission [14, 9]. Given the derived distance of 4.7\u00b10.4\nkpc, the age of G 21.5-0.9 was revised downwards\nby a factor of \u223c10 to force consistency with the\nfreely expanding SNR shell [9]. PSR J1833-1034\nin G 21.5-0.9 is the second most energetic pulsar\nknown in the Galaxy.\nKes 75 (SNR G29.70.3) is also a prototypical example of a composite remnant for which the distance of 19 kpc was estimated through neutral hydrogen absorption measurements [1].

The white contours show the pre-trials significance\nlevels for 4, 5, 6 \u03c3, and 7, 8, 9 \u03c3, respectively. The black triangle marks the position of the pulsars. The\nbest-fit positions of the two sources are marked with an error cross (for HESS J1846-029 the latter overlaps\nwith the triangle).\nshell surrounds a flat-spectrum highly polarized radio core, and harbors, at its center, the 325 ms Xray Pulsar, PSR J1846-258 [13]. The latter has\nthe shortest known characteristic age \u03c4c = 723 yr\nand a large inferred magnetar-like magnetic field of\nB= 4.9\u00d71013 G. The pulsar lies within a 25\u2032\u2032 \u00d720\u2032\u2032\nX-ray nebula which exhibits an photon index of\n1.92\u00b10.04, but no evidence of cooling as a function of the distance to the pulsar. Like in G 21.50.9 there is an X-ray halo, in this case due mostly\nto dust scattering, but a non-thermal contribution\nfrom electrons accelerated in the shell remains possible [15].\n\nObservations, Analysis & Results\nResults presented in this section should be considered as preliminary.\nThe first H.E.S.S. observations of G 21.5-0.9 and\nKes 75 were performed during 2004 and 2005 as\npart of the systematic survey of the inner Galactic\nplane within the longitude range l \u2208[\u221230\u25e6,+30\u25e6 ]\nand latitude band b \u2208[\u22123\u25e6 ,+3\u25e6 ]. Kes 75, at the\nedge of the first survey, was covered in the extension to l \u2208[+30\u25e6 ,+60\u25e6] of the survey in the years\n\n2005-2007. The data obtained through the systematic survey was completed with followup observations of promising candidates in wobble mode,\nhence the two sources are offset at various angular distances with respect to the center of the field\nof view. The total quality-selected and dead-time\ncorrected data-set includes 19.7 hours of data on\nG 21.5-0.9 and 24.1 hours on Kes 75, with average\noffsets of 1.33\u25e6 and 1.1\u25e6 , for each source, respectively.\nThe standard scheme for the reconstruction of\nevents was applied to the data [5]. Cuts on the\nscaled width and length of images (optimised on \u03b3ray simulations and off-source data) were used to\nsuppress the hadronic background. As described\ne.g. in [6], sky-maps and morphological analyses are made with a tight cut on the image size\nof 200 p.e. (photoelectrons) to achieve a maximum signal-to-noise ratio and a narrow PSF (point\nspread function). For the spectral analysis, the image size cut is loosened to 80 p.e. in order to cover\nthe maximum energy range. The background estimation for each position in the two-dimensional\nsky map is made in the same way as for search\nof extended sources [12], i.e. computed from a\nring with a radius of 1.0\u25e6 .

The\nshaded area shows the 1 \u03c3 confidence region for the fit parameters.\nthis radius yields seven times a larger area for the\nbackground estimation than the on-source region.\nThe background used for the derivation of the spectrum, is evaluated from circular regions in the field\nof view with the same radius and same offset from\nthe pointing direction as that of the source region.\nFinally, to avoid contamination of the background,\nevents coming from known sources were excluded.\nFig. 1 shows the Gaussian-smoothed excess maps\nfor HESS J1833-105 and HESS J1846-029 where\nthe white contours mark the pre-trials significance\nlevels. Both sources were first discovered as hotspots within the analysis scheme described above\nand then confirmed through additional followup\ndata at pre-trials significance of 6.4 and 9.9 standard deviations, respectively. A conservative estimate of the trials yields post-trials significance\nof 4.0 \u03c3 and 8.3 \u03c3 for HESS J1833-105 and\nHESS J1846-029, respectively.\nThe extension and the position of the sources\nwere evaluated by adjusting to the images\na symmetrical two-dimensional Gaussian function, convolved with the instrument PSF (5\u2032\nfor this analysis).\nThe best-fit positions\nlie at 18h 33m32.5s \u00b10.9s ,\u221210d33\u203219\u2032\u2032 \u00b155\u2032\u2032 and\n18h 46m 24.1s \u00b10.5s,\u221202d58\u203253\u2032\u2032 \u00b134\u2032\u2032 . The intrinsic extensions are compatible with a point-like\nsource for both sources and their positions are in\na quite good agreement with the pulsars associated\n\nto each supernova remnant, i.e. PSR J1833-1036\n(18h 33m 33.57s,\u221210d34\u20327.5\u2032\u2032 ) and PSR J18460258 (18h 46m24.5s ,\u221202d58\u203228\u2032\u2032 ).\nThe energy spectra of the two sources are derived\nusing the forward-folding maximum likelihood fit\nof a power-law [17]. The fluxes are at a level of\n\u223c2% of that of the Crab Nebula and the spectra\nare rather hard (Fig. 2): the photon indices are\n2.08\u00b10.22stat and 2.26\u00b10.15stat for HESS J1833105 and HESS J1846-029, respectively, with a systematic error of \u00b10.1.\n\nDiscussion\nIt is remarkable that de Jager et al. [11] predicted\nthat plerionic VHE \u03b3-rays from G21.5-0.9 would\nbe detectable at a level of 4 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121\nat 1 TeV with an electron spectral index of \u223c2.8,\nwhich would give a photon index near 2.0 at VHE\nenergies (after including KN effects given the contributions from dust and CMBR). Their prediction was based on an assumed equipartition field\nstrength of 22 \u03bcG which is close to the value of\n\u223c15\u03bcG implied from \u03b3-ray observations reported\nhere (assuming IC scattering on CMB photons\nonly, and using the ratio of the X-ray to the \u03b3ray luminosities: LX /L\u03b3 \u223c 30). The equipartition\nfield strength was afterwards increased to 0.3 mG\nfollowing the revision of the maximum spectral\n\n\fN EW C OMPANIONS FOR THE LONELY C RAB ?\n\nrange of the radio PWN to 500 GHz [20, 9]. However, the detection of VHE \u03b3-rays by H.E.S.S. from\nPWN tends to confirm the suggestion of Chevalier [3] that some PWN may be particle dominated,\nso that the true PWN field strength may be significantly lower than equipartition for some objects. In the case of Kes 75, LX /L\u03b3 \u223c10 yields\nalso a lower than equipartition nebular magnetic\nfield strength of \u223c10 \u03bcG. It should be noted that\nKes 75 shows the highest conversion efficiency\nin X-rays (\u223c 15%) as compared to other \"Crablike\" pulsars (\u223c 3% and \u223c 0.6% for the Crab and\nG 21.5-0.9, respectively) and a 100 times larger \u03b3ray efficiency (\u223c2%) than the Crab and G 21.5-0.9\nwhich are similar in that respect (\u223c0.02%). However, the latter object's LX /L\u03b3 \u223c 30 is 4 times\nsmaller than that of the Crab Nebula LX /L\u03b3 \u223c\n120. These numbers together with the spin parameters and high surface magnetic field in the case of\nPSR J1846-0258, show that these objects, although\n\"Crab-like\" in some aspects, do possess peculiar\nproperities.\nGiven the evidence for synchrotron emission in\nthe SNR shell, an alternative interpretation of the\nVHE emissions of G 21.5-0.9 and Kes75 would\nbe radiation from particles accelerated at the nonrelativistic forward shock of the freely expanding\nSNR. However the required field strength in the\nshell to explain the H.E.S.S. detection in terms of\nIC scattering should be much lower than 10 \u03bcG,\nvalue which may be unreasonably low for typical expanding SNR shells. Deeper observations of\nboth sources could help to constrain the size of the\nVHE emission region and to ascertain whether it is\ncompatible with this scenario.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe support of the Namibia authorities and of\nthe University of Namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of H.E.S.S. is gratefully\nacknowledged, as is the support by the German\nMinistry for Education and Research (BMBF), the\nMax Planck Society, the French Ministry for Research, the CNRS-IN2P3 and the Astroparticle Interdisciplinary Programme of the CNRS, the U.K.\nParticle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), the IPNP of the Charles University,\n\nthe Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the South African Department of Science\nand Technology and National Research Foundation, and by the University of Namibia.
