INTRODUCTION\nWe are exploring the creation of web objects (WO) that\nestablish and maintain links between themselves and can\nlive without the intervention of conventional repositories.\nWe are investigating how data inside the WOs could outlive\nthe individuals and institutions that created the data with\nlittle or no external guidance or direction making them ideal\nfor use in environments where the stewardship of the data is\nparamount. WOs can be thought of as having all the properties Kahn-Wilensky Framework digital objects [17] except\nthat they live directly in the Web Architecture [15] and do\nnot require an explicit repository system (e.g., DSpace, Fedora) for management, nor do they require global knowledge\nof the entire network.\nThese WOs send messages back and forth between each\nother and have the desirable small-world characteristics of\nrelatively high clustering coefficients (where there is a high\nprobability that \"a friend of a friend is my friend as well\")\nand a short average path length between any two nodes in\nthe graph. We have developed an Unsupervised Small World\n(USW) algorithm that creates graphs with the desired characteristics by adding one node at a time to an existing graph.\nEdges between nodes are created based on local information\nthat each new node discovers from nodes already part of\nthe graph. A graph of these WOs is robust and individual\nWOs can communicate with one another even when the underlying infrastructure has been damaged or disabled using\ntheir internal and locally maintained data structures. Some\nof the messages that the WOs could exchange might include\nthe location of a service that wold migrate data in an \"old\"\nformat to a \"new\" one (migration from GIFF to JPEG), the\nlocation of a new server willing and ready accept additional\nWOs for storage (refreshing of the bits), etc. to support\npreservation efforts.\nThis is an extension of our prior work on self-contained\ndigital objects [25] and earlier investigations into the creation of self-arranging networks [8]. In this paper we present\nthe simulation results of an algorithm for digital objects to\ncreate a small-world Graph without direct supervision by an\nadministrator or repository. Although assistance from administrators or repositories is possible in this model, it is not\nrequired. The motivation for and scenarios of how a network\nof WOs could engage in digital preservation tasks is covered\nin [9]; this paper presents only the analysis of an algorithm\nto test the robustness and resilience of such a network.\n\n\f2.\n\nTYPES OF GRAPHS BASED ON DEGREE\nDISTRIBUTIONS\n\nGraphs can be classified by many different and overlapping criteria including the presence or absence of well defined\nstructural elements. Randi\u0107 and DeAlba [30] provide an extensive list of different classifications. Within this paper, we\nare interested in the classifying graphs by their degree distributions. Those processes can be purely random, power\nlaw, classical Watts - Strogatz small-world, or our USW\nconstruction process.\nEach of these processes generates a graph with distinctively different degree distributions, clustering coefficients\n(CC) and expected average path lengths. Figure 1 is a plot\nof representative degree distributions for each of these types\nof graphs. In Figure 1, the red circles are characteristic of\na power law distribution. The black x's are from a smallworld graph and look very much like a random distribution\nbecause the underlying methodology for creating the edges is\nrandom. The difference between a small-world distribution\nand a random one is the smallness of the degree distribution \u03c3 and having a mean \u03bc that is same as the underlying\nlattice that was used as the base. While this small-world\ndistribution is \u00b1 4, a similar random one is \u00b1 10. A random\ngraph degree distribution is shown with the green triangles,\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nPower Law\nRandom\nUSW\nSmall \u2212 World\n\n0\n\nOccurrences\n\nMilgram [22] is credited with formulating the idea that\nin a social network, the path length between any two randomly selected individuals in the US in the 1960 was on\naverage between 5 and 6, leading to the phrase \"6 degrees\nof freedom.\" An algorithmic technique from a totally ordered k-degree lattice to a random graph passing through a\nphase that exhibited Milgram's small-world characteristics\nwas made popular by Watts - Strogatz [32]. Their technique required a k degree lattice as a foundation before a\nsmall-world could be constructed.\nWe would prefer if the WOs could self-organize into a\ngraph exhibiting small-world properties without first creating a regular or random graph as a starting point. Smallworld graphs are interesting because they occur frequently\nin a variety of different fields. They have been found in\ncellular metabolism, Hollywood actor relationships, Internet routers, protein regulatory networks, research collaborations, sexual relations and World Wide Web page linkages\n[3]. Furthermore, current methods for small-world graph\ncreation are based on an outside view of the network and an\nomnipresent/omnipotent view of the graph structure.\nWe test the robustness and resilience of classical random,\npower law, small-world and our USW graphs by subjecting\neach to a set of strategies that an attacker might use to disconnect the graph. We test these graphs by using a game\nwhere the attacker and the graph alternate turns. The attacker will be able to inflict damage on the graph (as a test\nof the graph's robustness), after which the graph will be\nable to repair and strengthen itself (as a test of the graph's\nresilience). Our efforts are focusing on the performance of\nthe graphs during different stress tests. We are primarily\ninterested in the autonomic processes that create and preserve the graph. By expanding the contents of the node from\npurely maintenance data to payload data (files, images, or\nother binary information), the contents of a USW graph\ncould be preserved from loss even in the face of repeated\ncensorship attacks.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50 100\n\n500\n\nlog scale of node degreeness\n\nFigure 1: Histogram of representative degree distributions of 1000 node graphs built using random,\npower law, small-world and USW processes.\nwhose \u03bc is centered at p \u2217 n and a Poisson distribution for\nthe rest of the degreed nodes. The USW construction parameters will affect the center of the blue crosses and where\nthat center lies on the x-axis. USW parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3\nwere set to 0.95 each in order to separate the USW graph\nfrom the other graphs. USW \u03b3 affects the left-right location\nof the center, while \u03b2 affects the height of the center. The\nCC for random and small-world graphs are C(G) \u223c nk and\nC(G) \u223c 34 respectively. While the average path lengths are\nn\nand L(G) \u223c 2k\nrespectively [32]. The CC and\nL(G) \u223c ln(n)\nln(k)\naverage path length of power law and USW graphs are not\ntractable and do not have a closed form solution.\n\n2.1 Random\nA random graph is one that is generated by some random process [16, 4]. These graphs can be created by many\nnon-equivalent techniques. At the end of the random graph\nconstruction process, the graph may not be connected.\n\n2.2 Power law\nPower law graphs are characterized by the fraction of\ntheir vertices that have a specified degree k. In general,\nthe degree distribution of a power law graph is given by:\np(k) = ck\u2212\u03b4 |c, \u03b4 > 0. Preferential attachment graphs are a\nspecial case of Power Law graphs. Preferential attachment\ngraphs grow over time by the addition of new vertices.\n\n2.3 Small-world\nSmall-world graphs introduced in [32, 28] begin with a klattice and rewiring each edge with a probability p. Smallworld graphs may be planar or non-planar and there is a\ngreater than 0 probability that the resulting graph will be\nneither simple and nor connected. Small-world graphs have\ndistinctive average path length and clustering coefficient properties.\nThe average distance between any two vertices is small\n(growing logarithmically with the number of vertices in G).\nThe average clustering coefficient for the graph is high. A\nclustering coefficient is the fraction of vertices that any two\nvertices have in common over the complete set of adjacent\nvertices that the two original vertices have. Random graphs\n\n\fhave low average path distances, but their average clustering\ncoefficients tend towards 0.\n\n2.4 Unsupervised Small World\nUnsupervised Small World (USW) graphs are simple, connected non-planar built by the autonomous actions of each\nnode as it is added to the existent graph. USW graphs are\ncharacterized by a clustering coefficient and average path\nlength comparable to that of traditional small-world graphs,\nbut markedly different in how they are constructed. The\nautonomous algorithm that each independent node uses to\nlocate itself within, and thereby grow the USW is detailed\nin [9, 8].\n\n3.\n\nATTACKER PROFILES\n\nThe selection of an attack profile involves is a decision\nbased on many different pieces of data. Included in this list\nof data is:\n\u2022 The goal of the attack (for instance complete removal\nof the graph, or inflicting enough damage to the graph\nto cause the graph to become disconnected),\n\u2022 Which metric to use to measure the progress of the\nattack,\n\u2022 What type of graph component (edge or vertex) to\nremove,\n\u2022 What technique to use to select the most \"central\" or\n\"vital\" component of the graph to remove,\n\u2022 When the components are ranked based on their centrality, which specific one to select.\n\n\u2206(G) = 1 \u2212\n\nmax(| Ci |) : \u2200C \u2208 {C}\nn\n\n(5)\n\nDiameter is the maximal shortest path between any vertices u and v\nD(G) = max{d(u, v) : u, v \u2208 V }\n\n(6)\n\nWhere n is the number of nodes in the entire graph, m is\nthe number of edges in the entire graph, p is a probability\nof connection or rewiring (based on the type of graph).\nDuring the course of the simulation, we expect the following changes in each of the above metrics when the graph\nconducts maintenance:\nAverage inverse path length to remain nearly the same\nor to growly slowly as the graph becomes more and\nbetter connected,\nAverage path length to decrease as more alternative paths\nare created,\nClustering Coefficients to increase as more triads are created because of the increasing edges,\nDensity to increase because the graph creates more edges,\nDamage to remain nearly static, and\nDiameter to decrease as the graph becomes more and better connected.\n\n3.2 Centrality measurements\n\n3.1 Attack progress metrics\nThe following metrics will be collected because they relate\ndirectly to the ability of the graph to communicate effectively between its WOs, and will change depending on the\namount of damage the graph sustains.\nAverage inverse path length is the inverse of the mean\nof all the shortest paths in the graph. Because the shortest\npath between vertices in two different components is \u221e, the\ninverse is 0 and therefore is a valid value that does not cause\nthe computation to fail. A larger average inverse path length\nmeans that the distance between nodes is on average shorter\n[14].\nX X\n1\n1\n1\nL(G)\u22121 \u2261 h\ni\u2261\n(1)\nd(v, w)\nn(n \u2212 1) v\u2208V w6=v\u2208V d(v, w))\nAverage path length is the mean of the all the shortest\n(geodesic) paths in the graph\nX\n1\nd(u, v)\n(2)\nL(G) =\n2\n|V | \u2212|V |\nu6=v\u2208V |0<d(u,v)<\u221e\n\nClustering Coefficient is the likelihood that two neighbors of v are connected [27, 29]\n3 \u2217 \u03a3N umber Of T riangles In T he Graph\nN umber Of Connected T riples\n(3)\nDensity is the ratio for the edges and nodes that are\nmembers of the connected graph [30]\nC(G) =\n\nn2\n1\n\u03c1(G) = (\n\u2212 1)(1 \u2212 )\n2m\nn\n\nDamage is the ratio of the largest component to the entire graph [7]\n\nA centrality measurement is a way of quantifying the notion that some components of a graph are more important\nthan others. Some centrality measurements are based purely\non data that is available at the graph component level and\nare invariant with respect to the rest of the graph; these are\ncalled local centrality measurements. Other measurements\nare dependent on the structure of the graph in to-to. These\nare called global centrality measurements. The difference\nbetween local and global knowledge is fundamentally one\nof degree using the idea of k \u2212 neighborhood. In the minimal case where k = 1, all knowledge is based on edges and\nvertices that are 1 edge away. In the maximal case where\nk = D(G), all knowledge is based on total knowledge of the\ngraph. Values of k from 1 and D(G) reflecting increasing\nknowledge of G.\n\n3.2.1 Betweenness\nBetweenness is a global centrality measurement. Betweenness is a measure of how many geodesic paths from any vertices s, t \u2208 V use a either an edge (see Equation 7) or a\nvertex (see Equation 8). Removal of a graph component\nbased on its betweenness is a direct attack on the global\nstructure of the graph.\ncB (e) =\n\n(7)\n\ns6=t\u2208V\n\ncB (V ) =\n(4)\n\nX \u03c3st (e)\n\u03c3st\nX\n\ns6=v6=t\u2208V\n\n\u03c3st (v)\n\u03c3st\n\n(8)\n\n\f3.2.2 Closeness\nCloseness is a global centrality measurement. Closeness\nquantifies the idea that a vertex has a shortest average geodesic\ndistance when compared to all geodesic distances.\nX\nd(u, v)\n(9)\ncC (u) =\nv\u2208V\n\n3.2.3 Degreeness\nDegreeness is a local centrality measurement. Degreeness\nis the number of edges that are incident to a vertex (see\nEquation 10). Degreeness only makes sense for vertices. A\nvertex with a high degreeness is central to a local portion of\nthe graph, but not necessarily to the graph in to-to.\ncD (v) = d(v)\n\n(10)\n\n3.3 Extremal values\nSelection of an attack profile is dependent on an appropriately selected centrality measurement, the type of graph\ncomponent (either E or V ) to delete and which of these\ncomponents to delete based on the centrality measurement\nselected. Any centrality measurement will result in an unordered list of numerical values. Depending on the type\nof measurement selected, either of the extremal values of\nHighest or Lowest will result in the most disruption to the\ngraph.\n\n3.4 Sample profiles\nAttacker profiles are described with a three character token created from permuting three disjointed sets. The sets\nare: {D,B,C} representing the centrality measurements Degreeness, Betwenneess and Closeness; {E,V} representing\ngraph component to be removed Edge and Vertex, and\n{L,H} representing which extremal value to use when selecting the component to be removed Low and High. An example of one permutation is: B-E-L meaning that betweenness\ncentrality measurement is being computed, an edge will be\nselected for removal and the lowest valued edge will be removed.\nEach of the different attack profiles is presented with the\nsame graph (see Figure 3). The attack profile continues to\nexecute until the graph is disconnected. In those cases where\nthere are multiple graph components with the same value\n(vertices of the same degreeness, edges with the same betweenness, etc.), the attack profile is recursively applied and\nthe total number of deletions is reported. Figure 2 shows\nthe sample graph is prior to the deletion of the first attack\nprofile specific element. Each attack profile assumes that the\nattacker has complete (i.e., global) knowledge of the graph\nand so is able to make decisions that are most advantageous\nto the attacker. How this knowledge is obtained is outside this discussion. The goal of each attack profile is the\ndisconnection of the graph, where disconnection is defined\nas the inability of vertex i to send a message to vertex j\ni 9 j : \u2203i,j \u2208 V . Therefore a graph with only one vertex is\nstill connected and that removing a vertex that is connected\nto only one other vertex does not disconnect the graph.\n\n3.5 Efficacy of different attack profiles\nAttacker profiles were used recursively against the sample\ngraph until the graph was disconnected. Table 1 reports the\nefficacy of different attacker profiles used against the sample\ngraph when vertices (or edges) are removed. Computing the\n\nFigure 3: The sample graph presented to each of\nthe attack profile. This graph is used because it has\nenough interesting vertices and edges so that each\nattack profile would select a different graph component to remove.\ncentrality value may result in more than one vertex (or edge)\nhaving the same value. Having the same value for two measurements is treated as creating two different graphs that are\ntreated in a recursive manner. For each profile, the number\nof unique graphs is reported as well as the maximum and\nminimum recursion depth. A mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) depths for all profiles are reported. Smaller values\nfor the maximum and minimum depths and \u03c3 points to a\nprofile that is always aggressive and effective. Good attack\nprofiles (from the attacker's perspective) are D-V-H, BE-H, or C-V-L because these attack the \"core\" elements of\nthe graph, while the other profiles \"nibble at the edges.\" The\nbest attack profile is B-V-H because it is most destructive\nat the core. The other attack profiles focus on the periphery\nand will result in disconnecting the graph or may result in a\nconnected graph that has only one vertex. These peripheral\nattack profiles take much longer than an attack on the core.\n\n4. IMPLEMENTING RESILIENCY IN\nGRAPHS OF DIFFERENT FLAVORS\nThe words robustness and resilience are used almost interchangeably when talking about graphs. But, they are very\ndifferent attributes that should not be confused.\nRobustness [18] is the ability of a graph to keep its basic\nfunctionality even under the failure of some of its components. These components can be any combination of the\ngraph's edges or vertices. A graph G = (V, E) is robust if\nmessages can be sent from i \u2192 j : \u2200i,j \u2208 V .\nResilience is the ability of a graph to recover readily from\ndamage and, in a sense to become more robust.\nImplementing resiliency in support of the Game resolved\nitself into two different categories based on the underlying\nmechanisms that were used to create the graph. The \"standard\" graphs (random, power law, and small-world) have a\nrelatively simple underlying mathematical foundation, while\nthe USW graph is created via a series of algorithmic steps.\nThis division is also reflected in how resilience is implemented.\n\n\f(a) B-E-L\n\n(b) B-E-H\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n43\n\n43\n5\n\n41\n\n28\n\n28\n\n22\n\n59\n\n5\n\n41\n\n22\n\n59\n\n22\n\n22\n\n39\n\n39\n\n69\n\n69\n\n59\n23\n\n59\n36\n\n48\n\n48\n\n23\n\n36\n\n48\n\n48\n\n0\n\n0\n\n26\n32\n\n8\n\n26\n32\n\n8\n\n(c) B-V-L\n\n(d) B-V-H\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n3\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\n(e) D-V-L\n\n(f) D-V-H\n\n0.69\n\n0.69\n0.68\n\n0.72\n\n0.68\n\n0.72\n\n0.82\n\n0.82\n0.72\n\n0.81\n\n0.76\n\n0.81\n\n0.76\n\n0.72\n\n0.83\n\n0.72\n0.72\n\n0.83\n0.72\n\n0.72\n\n0.79\n\n0.79\n\n0.81\n\n0.81\n\n0.83\n0.76\n\n0.83\n0.76\n\n0.82\n\n0.81\n\n0.76\n0.79\n\n(g) C-V-L\n\n0.76\n\n0.82\n\n0.81\n\n0.78\n\n0.76\n\n0.76\n\n0.78\n\n0.76\n\n0.76\n0.79\n\n(h) C-V-H\n\nFigure 2: The first graph component that will be removed based on different attack profiles.

For all \"standard\" graphs,\nit is assumed that 10% of the nodes will be re-activated (via\na manner that is outside this discussion) and will attempt to\nform links to other nodes in the graph. Further it is assumed\nthat only 90% of these attempts will be successful. Connection attempts are not 100% successful in order to simulate\ndowntime at the host where a node lives and timeouts in the\ncommunications channels.\n\n4.2 Unsupervised Small World\nUnsupervised Small World (USW) graphs are created using a number of control parameters. These parameters autonomously create a graph that has small-world characteristics using only locally gained knowledge. The parameters\nthat were used to create the graph are the same ones that\nare used to implement resilience.\nDuring the simulation, when the USW graph is written to\nthe database, all the control parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and others)\nare also written. When the USW graph is to be reconstituted, the original control parameters are used to reconstitute the graph.\n\n5.\n\nTHE GAME\n\nA Game is a competitive activity involving skill, chance,\nor endurance between two or more players who play according to a set of rules to achieve some goal. There are two\nplayers in this game: Alice (the person responsible for repairing the graph) and Mallory (the attacker).\nA graph may be subject to different types of damage.\nDamage resulting from a random event or occurrence can\nbe classified as is an error [1]. While, damage from something other than a random act, is classified as an attack. For\nexample, loss of a single router in a computer network could\nbe viewed as a random event. Loss of all routers at the same\ntime would be called an attack. Structurally different types\nof graphs (random, power law, small-world) [20, 24, 10, 31,\n33, 18, 6, 26, 5] are robust in different ways when the same\nnumber of graph components are lost.\nAlbert, Jeong and Barab\u00e1si [1] focus on power law, networks such as the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. They conclude that these networks have are\ntolerant to many random failures, but are very susceptible\nto the failure of a few critical elements because of their underlying structure. This type of sensitivity is common to\npower law networks. USW is not a power law graph and is\nnot sensitive to targeted attacks.\n\nMoreno, Pastor-Satorras et al, [23] focus on the effects\nof a cascading failure in a power law network. Using their\nanalysis, they identified a critical load in the traffic through\na failed network component above which the resulting traffic congestion will destroy network communications. This\ncritical threshold is based on the idea that each component has a communications tolerance that when exceeded\ncauses the component to fail. By keeping these limitations\nin mind, USW graphs have been designed without tolerances\nand are able to send as much traffic as the underlying Web\narchitecture can support. Zio and Sansavini [33] expand on\nthe ideas of Moreno and Pastor-Satorras by exploring smallworld graphs as well. Zio and Sansavini go on to quantify\nthe amount of excess capacity (of a normalized loading) that\neach node in both types of graphs must have to prevent cascading failures.\nGuillaume, Latapy and Magnien [13] extend Albert, Jeong\nand Barab\u00e1si investigation to include random graphs. They\nshow that the removal of a similar number of edges for the\ntwo graph types will result in a disconnected graph, and\nthen propose an efficient attack strategy based on removal\nof edges. The attack ideas were incorporated into the attack\nprofiles used to test the robustness and resilience of the USW\ngraphs.\nMotter and Lai [24] focus on the effects of cascading failures due to overloading of the Internet and power grids. In\nthese types of graphs the traffic when a component fails, the\ntraffic (be it either packets or electrical power) being serviced by that component is transfered to other components\nof the same type to which the failed component was connected. Their analysis shows that an attack, or a failure of\nan exceptionally heavily loaded component may have a cascading failure affect on other components. Traffic between\nUSW components are not bound or limited except by the\nunderlying Web Architecture and are those immune from\nthese types of cascading failures.\nFarkas, Antal, et al. [12] proposed imbuing an ethernet\nnetwork with a distributed resilient architecture based on\nthe use of multiple static routes stored in routers spread\nacross the network. In the event that a router were to fail,\nor become unavailable, the connected routers would immediately begin using the secondary spanning tree routes. These\nsecondary routes would be maintained in addition to the\nprimary routes. The USW model does not maintain static\nor dynamic routes.\nCriado, Flores, et al. [10] propose two measures to assess\nthe robustness of a graph to random and intentional attacks.\nThese measures take into account the graph's topology and\n\n\fis computable in polynomial time. Their measures can be\nviewed as another type of centrality where the node (or edge)\nwhose presence means that the graph is less vulnerable and\nwhose absence wold make the graph more vulnerable. The\nevaluation of the vulnerability of USW graphs will take their\nideas into consideration.\nNetotea and Pongor [26] take as input a graph and through\nevolution increase it's efficiency and robustness by rewiring\nthe graph. They take existing an existing edge and move one\nend to a different node and then measuring the efficiency of\nthe graph at each stage. Their definition of efficiency is:\nX 1\n1\nE(G) =\n(11)\nn(n + 1) i6=j\u2208V dij\nwhereby the average distance between all nodes decreases.\nThey define robustness at time t as R(G) = EEt . Within\nUSW, once edges are created, they are not removed or altered. The efficiency of the USW graph will increase by the\naddition of more nodes and edges.\n\n5.1 The goal\nOur goal for the game is to determine the robustness of\nselected graph types in the face of different types of attacks\n(attacker profiles) and how resilient each graph type is when\ngiven an opportunity to recover from some of the damage\nsuffered in the attack. The game seeks to answer the question: how many edges or nodes can the attacker remove\nbefore the graph was disconnected? Different attack profiles\nwill be exercised and the worst type of attack (i.e., the one\nwith the highest likelihood of success from the attacker's perspective) will be identified. Each of the graphs described in\nSection 2 will compete against a set of attack profiles. Each\nattack will use a different and unchanging profile against the\ngraph. The game is over when either: the graph is disconnected, or the simulation runs to an end.\n\n5.2 The players\nDuring the game; Mallory will have global knowledge of\nthe graph (how this knowledge was obtained is not part of\nthe game) and can choose to remove any graph component\n(either edge or vertex) that he feels is to his benefit. Alice\nhas only local knowledge and does not know how or where\nthe next attack will occur. After the Mallory's turn, Alice\nwill have a turn to reconstitute the graph in preparation for\nthe next attack. Mallory and Alice will alternate turns until\none wins. The goal of the game from the Mallory's perspective is to cause the graph to become disconnected and\ntherefore Alice would not be able to use the graph to send\na message to Bob. The goal from the Alice's perspective is\nto remain connected as long as possible.\n\n5.3 The rules\nThere are few rules in this game. They are:\n1. The graph is created without any interference from\nMallory.\n\n4. The number (or percentage) of graph components that\nAlice can reconstitute per turn remains fixed for the\nduration of the game.\n5. The game is over if the graph is disconnected at the\nend of Mallory's turn, or the number of game turns\nreaches the maximum number allowed.\nIf at the end of the game the graph is disconnected then\nMallory has won, otherwise Alice has won.\n\n5.4 A sample game\nData are collected and analyzed during the course of the\ngame between Mallory and Alice. A specific instance of a\n10 turn game is shown in Figures 4 and 5. A power law\ndegree distribution graph was created and a D-V-H attack\nprofile was used for 10 turns against the graph. As can be\nseen in Figure 4 the induced subgraph was severely damaged\nduring the first 3 turns and then less damaged later. Two\nof nine turns are highlighted. During turn 2, the damaged\ninduced by vertex deletion increases during the turn and\nthe overall damage to the graph is shown at the end of the\nturn. During turn 4, there is minimal damage to the subgraph and the overall damage to the total graph is low. The\nworst damage was done to graph be the end of the fourth\nturn, after which the graph had reconstituted itself enough\nto withstand future attacks.\n\n6. GRAPHS TAKEN TO DISCONNECTION\n6.1 What data was collected\nAt the end of each turn, the following measurements or\ncharacteristics are collected and presented: average path,\nclustering coefficient, density and diameter.\nThe y-axis is normalized from 0 to 1 for all figures. The xaxis is linear and represents the \"shot\" taken by the Mallory\nat the graph. Mallory had 100 shots (10% of a 1000 vertex\ngraph) per turn.\n\n6.2 How graphs were created\nThe R igraph package [11] was used to create the \"standard\" graphs from Section 2. The USW graph creator program was set up to run with all possible combinations of first\nattachment, node visitation and queue processing policies\nand 4 values each for \u03b2 and \u03b3. Every graph was attacked\nbased on degreeness, betweenness and closeness for either\nedge or node as appropriate and for each possible extremal\nvalue\n\n6.2.1 Non-unsupervised small-world\nThe R package igraph functions erdos.renyi.game(),\nbarabasi.game() and watts.strogatz.game() were used to create random, power law and small-world graphs respectively\nof 1000 nodes each. Each graph was checked to ensure that\nit was simple and connected.\n\n6.2.2 Unsupervised Small World graphs\n\n2. Once Mallory chooses an attack profile, he must use\nthat same profile for the duration of the game.\n\nA complete description of the USW construction process\ncan be found in [9, 8]. The dominant control parameters for\nthe destruction game are:\n\n3.

Table 3 summarizes the comments in\nthe previous subsections about the efficacy of the different\nattack profiles. After evaluating the efficacy of the various\nattacker profiles; B-V-H was selected as best (from the attacker's perspective).\n\nTable 2 itemizes the results of the various attack profiles\nagainst the \"standard\" and USW graphs.\n\n7.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nMallory is in a much stronger position than Alice. Mallory's knowledge of the graph is only limited by the amount\nof time and energy that he wishes to expend exploring the\ngraph. If the depth of the graph that Mallory wishes to explore is called path length (PL), then the range on the size\nof the induced subgraph he will discover could grow exponentially based on PL (see Equation 12).\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (2 \u2217 P L, D(G)) if Power Law\nS=\nhkiP L\nif Random\n\uf8f3\n(2 \u2217 P L, D(G)) if Watts-Strogatz small-world\n(12)\n= p(n \u2212 1) \u2248 pn is the average number\nWhere hki = 2m\nn\nof edges adjacent to any node in the graph.\nEven modest increases in P L (for example from 2 to 5)\ncan have profound effect on the size of the induced subgraph.\nBy way of illustration, it has been estimated that the entire\nInternet is no more that 19 clicks (edges or PL) in size [2].\nAlice is a severe disadvantage. She is limited to purely local knowledge (i.e., PL = 1), and can only randomly select\nwhich nodes to use to reconstitute the graph. The percentage of vertices that she can activate has to be high enough\nto have a reasonable expectation of overlapping those graph\ncomponents that Mallory has attacked. If Alice can cover\nthose components that Mallory has affected then the graph\n\n8. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have demonstrated that a graph of WOs created based\non the USW algorithm is both robust and resilient in a simulation environment. The next major step will be to take it\nfrom the theoretical environment and to a real-world implementation. One possible implementation is to further the\nideas in [21] by writing and fielding a Firefox plugin using\nthe Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) model from [19] to identify data that could be\nsubmitted to a digital library for preservation. These WOs\nwould be monitored for some length of time in order to see\nhow well reality matches the simulations.\nWe investigated the efficacy of various attack profiles on\na graph of web objects. The most effective (i.e., the most\ndestructive) is when the attacker uses a Betweenness Vertex\nHigh centrality measurements to select which vertex to remove. The size of the subgraph that the attacker can focus\non is dependent on the graph's average degree connectivity\n\u03b4(G) and is exponential on the Path Length from a root\nnode. If the number of graph components an attacker can\nremove is greater than the number that can be reconstituted\nthen the graph will eventually be destroyed. Based on simulations, the Unsupervised Small World (USW) graphs are\nmore robust and resilient then those constructed using classical random, power law, or Watt-Strogatz techniques. A\ngraph of USW connected WOs filled with data could outlive the individuals and institutions that created the data\n\n\feven in an environment where WOs are lost due to random\nfailures or directed attacks.\n\n9.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work supported in part by the NSF, Project 370161.\nWe also wish to thank the three anonymous referees for their\nconstructive comments on an earlier version of this paper.\n\n10.
