INTRODUCTION\n\nIt has been a central theme since the discovery of statistical mechanics to understand\nhow the analytic partition function for a finite-size system acquires a singularity in the\nthermodynamic limit if the system undergoes a phase transition [1]. The Lee-Yang theory\n[2] has partly furnished the answer to this quest. They proposed a scenario where the zeros\nof the partition function form a line and cut across the real axis. They showed that the\ndiscontinuity in the 1st order derivative of partition function is proportional to the angular\ndensity of zeros, using an analogy with the two dimensional electrostatics. Then they proved\nthis scenario for Ising-like discrete systems under very general conditions. They could show\nthat the zeros were distributed on a unit circle in this case.\nThere have been many attempts to generalize the \"Lee-Yang circle theorem\" ever since.\nFisher [3] initiated a study of zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature\nplane and extensive studies of zeros of the partition function in complex temperature plane\nfollowed [4\u201312]. In these works authors considered continuous phase transitions or critical\npoints.\nThe conceptual basis of the Lee-Yang circle theorem was finally clarified in ref. [13]\nby considering the first-order transition of a system with more general continuous degrees\nof freedom, with a doubly peaked probability distribution for the order parameter. Since\nthe Ising-like models considered by Lee and Yang would be described by two symmetric\nGaussian peaks in the thermodynamic limit, this result provides a simple conceptual basis\nfor Lee-Yang unit circle theorem. Furthermore it is a generalization since general asymmetric\nconfigurations were considered, whose zeros form a curve which is not a unit circle in general.\nOne interesting problem to consider is what happens when the positions of the two\nGaussian peaks coincide. Since this is the limit where the latent heat l vanishes, one might\nnaively expect that the system would exhibit a second-order transition of the Ehrenfest\nclassification [14], where there is a finite discontinuity in specific heat but no latent heat.\n(Fig.1).\nHowever, when we consider the exact zeros of the partition function for the system with\ntwo Gaussian peaks, we find there is a branch of zeros other than the one described in\nref. [13]. For l 6= 0, this branch can be neglected, since for generic systems the Gaussian\napproximation breaks down at this point due to the contributions from the higher order\ncumulants. However, for l = 0 this is no more true and we have to take this branch into\naccount. Because of this, the system exhibits a critical behavior instead of the second-order\ntransition.\n\n\fFIGURES\n\nE/N\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b2o/\u03b2\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 1. The energy density as a function of the reduced temperature at the second-order\ntransition. The branch (a) is for \u2206c > 0, and (b) is for \u2206c < 0.\nII. LOCUS AND DENSITY OF ZEROS\n\nWe consider a canonical partition function of a continuum system, which can be written\nas in ref. [13]\nM(t) \u2261 Z(\u03b2)/Z(\u03b20) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\netx f (x)dx\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the probability density function is given by\nf (x) = \u03a9(x/\u03b20 )e\u2212x /\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03a9(x/\u03b20 )e\u2212x dx,\n\n(2.2)\n\nt = 1 \u2212 \u03b2/\u03b20 , x = \u03b20 E, \u03a9(E) is the density of states at energy E and \u03b20 is the inverse\nof the transition temperature we are interested in. When one is interested in field driven\nphase transition, one may replace the energy E by the magnetization M and the inverse\ntemperature \u03b2 by the magnetic field H in case of magnetic systems, so on. We investigate\nthe locus of zeros on the plane of complex temperature z = rei\u03b8 \u2261 et .\nNow consider the case of interest in this paper, when f (x) is given by summation of two\nGaussian peaks up to normalization,\nf (x) = \u221a\n\n1\n1\n(x \u2212 \u03bc1 )2\n(x \u2212 \u03bc2 )2\n\u221a\n]\n+\na\n]\nexp[\u2212\nexp[\u2212\n2\u03c312\n2\u03c322\n2\u03c0\u03c31\n2\u03c0\u03c32\n\n(2.3)\n\nThese two peaks represent two different phases of the system. When \u03bc1 6= \u03bc2 the system\nundergoes the first-order transition. Let us denote two Gaussian functions by f1 (x) and\nf2 (x). Since we can relabel f1 and f2 , and redefine a, we may assume m \u2261 (\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc1 )/2 > 0\nwithout loss of generality. We then have\nM(t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\netx [f1 (x) + af2 (x)]dx\n\n\f= exp(\u03c81 ) + exp(\u03c82 )\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\nexp(\u03c81 (t)) \u2261\nexp(\u03c82 (t)) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\netx f1 (x)dx\netx af2 (x)dx.\n\n(2.5)\n\nFrom the expressions above, one can easily see that the locations of zeros are given by the\nsolutions to the following equation as in ref. [13]\n\u03c82 (tk ) \u2212 \u03c81 (tk ) = 2iIk \u2261 i(2k + 1)\u03c0\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere k runs through all the integers. For the double Gaussian distribution the equation\nabove can be rewritten as\niIk =\n\n1\n\u03c3\u0303 2\nln a + m(tk ) + (tk )2\n2\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0303 2 = (\u03c322 \u2212 \u03c312 )/2. This equation is quadratic and easily solved. The solutions are\n\u221a s\n2\nm\nm2\n1\n\u00b1\nln\na\n+\nt\u00b1\n=\n\u2212\niI\n\u2212\nk\nk\n\u03c3\u0303 2\n|\u03c3\u0303|\n2\n2\u03c3\u0303 2\nm\n|Ik |\n\u03bbk\n=\u2212 2 \u00b1\n\u00b1 i sign(Ik )| |\n\u03c3\u0303\n|\u03bbk \u03c3\u0303|\n\u03c3\u0303\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere\n\u03bbk \u2261\n\nvs\nu\nu\nt\n\n(\n\nm2\nln a 2\nm2\nln a\n2\n\u2212\n)\n+\nI\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n)\nk\n2\n2\n2\u03c3\u0303\n2\n2\u03c3\u0303\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\nNote that there are two branches of solutions. One passes through the transition point t = 0\nin the thermodynamic limit and the other does not, so the latter was implicitly discarded in\nref. [13]. As we will see, the second branch closes in toward t = 0 as we take the limit l \u2192 0.\nNow we redefine the variables\nNl\n2\nNyk\nIk =\n2\nN\u2206c\n\u03c3\u0303 2 =\n2\nm=\n\nand consider the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e. We then get\nln(rk ) \u2261 R(tk ) = \u2212\n\nm\n|Ik |\n\u00b1\n2\n\u03c3\u0303\n|\u03c3\u0303\u03bbk |\n\n(2.10)\n\n\f=\u2212\n\n|yk |\nl\n\u00b1 rq\n2\n\u2206c\n( l2 )2 + yk2(\u2206c)2 \u2212\n\n\u03b8k \u2261 I(tk ) = \u00b1sign(Ik )|\n=\n\nvv\nuu\nuu\nu 1\n\u00b1sign(yk )tt (\n\nl2\n2\n\n\u03bbk\n|\n\u03c3\u0303\n\nl 4\nyk2\nl2\n) +\n\u2212\n4 \u2206c\n(\u2206c)2 2(\u2206c)2\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe terms involving ln a are finite size corrections and vanish in this limit. We solve the\nsecond equation of (2.11) in terms of yk to get\ns\n\nyk = \u00b1\u03b8k l 1 + \u03b8k2 (\n\n\u2206c 2\n)\nl\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe substitute (2.12) into the first equation of (2.11) to get the locus of zeroes,\n\uf8ee\n\nr\u00b1 = exp \uf8f0\u2212\n\n\uf8f9\n\ns\n\n\u2206c\nl\nl\n\u00b1\n1 + \u03b8k2 ( )2 \uf8fb\n\u2206c |\u2206c|\nl\n\n(2.13)\n\nWe can also obtain the angular density of zeros.

FIRST-ORDER TRANSITIONS\n\nWe will now consider both loci of zeros of the partition function at first-order transition.\nNote that all the quantities above depend only on the ratio l/\u2206c except for a overall factor\nof l in front of g(\u03b8).1 When l/\u2206c 6= 0, we get the first-order transition. This is the case\n1 When\n\nboth l and \u2206c are zero these quantities are ill-defined and we can no longer use the\nGaussian approximation. One then has to take into account higher order cumulants.\n\n\fconsidered in ref. [13]. There only the locus of zeros near the transition point t = 0 were\ntreated carefully since these were the only things of interest. In fact, for generic systems we\nexpect that the Gaussian approximation breaks down away from the transition point t = 0\ndue to the higher-order cumulants.\nLet us elaborate on this point. The locus of zeros cross the real axis at t = 0 and\nt = \u22122l/\u2206c, indicating there are two phase transitions. This can be easily understood. The\nprobability density at arbitrary temperature is given by\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\netx e\u2212(x\u2212x1 ) /(2\u03c31 ) etx e\u2212(x\u2212x2 ) /(2\u03c32 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\ne \u03a9(x) =\n+\n2\u03c0\u03c31\n2\u03c0\u03c32\n2 2\n2\n2 2\n\u2212(x\u2212x1 \u2212\u03c312 t)2 /(2\u03c312 )+x1 t+\u03c312 t2 /2\ne\u2212(x\u2212x2 \u2212\u03c32 t) /(2\u03c32 )+x2 t+\u03c32 t /2\ne\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+\n=\n2\u03c0\u03c31\n2\u03c0\u03c32\ntx\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe see that for nonzero t the positions of the peaks are shifted, and also the relative weights\nchange. We see that the position of the peak for large \u03c3i gets shifted by a larger amount\nfor given temperature change, consistent with the fact that it has larger specific heat. The\nweight of the peak 1 relative to the peak 2 is given by:\n(\u03c312 \u2212 \u03c322 ) 2\nw1/w2 \u2261 exp(\nt + (x1 \u2212 x2 )t)\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nBy construction, at t = 0, the weight of two Gaussian peak is equal. Assuming \u03c32 > \u03c31 , we\nsee that for t > 0 the peak labeled by 2 dominates. When t becomes slightly negative, then\nthe peak 1 dominates. Also the positions of the Gaussian peaks get shifted to left, but the\npeak 2 moves faster. For t < \u2212(x1 \u2212 x2 )/(\u03c312 \u2212 \u03c322 ) the peak 2 goes to the left of the peak\n1. At t = \u22122l/\u2206c, the weight of the peak 2 become equal to that of 1 again, and the peak\n2 is dominant for t < \u22122l/\u2206c. Therefore at this temperature there is another first-order\ntransition with latent heat l and specific heat change \u2212\u2206c. We can make similar arguments\nfor \u03c31 > \u03c32 . This process is depicted in Fig.2.\nThis mechanism works only if we trust that the Gaussian form given in (2.3) is exact.\nHowever, for a generic system, this is just a leading truncation of the cumulant expansion\nf \u2032\u2032 (x0 )\nf \u2032\u2032 (x0 )\n(\u2206x)2 +\n(\u2206x)3 + * * *)],\n(3.3)\n2\n3!\n\u221a\nso the higher order cumulants can be ignored only when \u2206x << O(1/ N ). But at the firstorder transition at t = \u22122l/\u2206c, the system is dominated by the peaks which are located\nat the distances of O(1) from the positions of the peaks at t = 0. Therefore the higherorder cumulants\n\u221a would contribute, and we cannot trust the picture above. However, when\n\u2206x << O(1/ N), or when the higher order cumulants are extremely small due to some\nreason, transition at t = \u22122l/\u2206c cannot be neglected anymore. In particular, in the limit\nl \u2192 0, the second branch touches the first branch, preventing the system from exhibiting\nthe second-order transition.\nexp[\u2212Nf (x)] = exp[\u2212N(f (x0 ) +\n\n\f-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n(b)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n(c)\n\n-30\n\n15\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-2l/\u2206c\n\n0.0\n\n-15\n\n(d)\n\nE/N\n\nt\n\n(e)\nFIG. 2. Qualitive behavior of etx \u03a9(x) versus x, where we take \u03bc1,2 = \u00b15 in this example. (a)\nFor t > 0 the peak 2 dominates (b) At t = 0 the weight of the two Gaussian peak is equal by\nconstruction, meaning the areas under the curves are same. (c) As t decreases below 0, the weight\nof peak 1 becomes larger. The first-order transition has occurred with the latent heat l and the\ndiscontinuity in the specific heat \u2206c. The positions of the peaks begin to get shifted to th left, with\npeak 2 moving faster. (d) For t < \u22122l/\u2206c, the weight of the peak 2 becomes larger than that of 1\nagain. At this point the peak 2 is at the left of the peak 1, so this is another first-order transition,\nwith the latent heat l and the discontinuity in the specific heat \u2212\u2206c. (e) Schematic diagram of\nenergy versus reduced temperature for the system with double Gaussian peaks. Note that there\nare two first-order transition with the same latent heat but opposite sign for the discontinuity in\nthe specific heat. The transition at t = \u22122l/\u2206c is discarded for generic systems.\n\nThe behaviors of the loci of zeros for various values of \u2206c/l are depicted in Fig.1,2 and\n3 in complex z \u2261 exp(t) plane. t+ is the outer curve and t\u2212 is the inner curve. Only the\nzeros in the first Riemann sheet are shown. When \u2206c/l > 0 (< 0), t+ (t\u2212 ) passes through\nt = 0, and becomes unit circle as one approaches the symmetric limit, \u2206c/l \u2192 0. This is\nconsistent with Lee-Yang's unit circle theorem. The other branch t\u2212 (t+ ) degenerates to\norigin.(goes to infinity.) The loci intersect the real axis orthogonally as long as l 6= 0.\n\n\f4\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22124\n\u221210\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n30\n\n10\n\n(b)\n\u221210\n\n\u221230\n\u221280\n\n\u221260\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221220\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3.

L \u2192 0 LIMIT AND THE CRITICAL BEHAVIOR\n\nThe limit l/\u2206c = 0 may be considered as the opposite limit from the symmetric case\n\u2206c/l = 0. Now the two loci t\u00b1 which were separate when l 6= 0, touch each other at \u03b8 = 0\nand form a single curve. (Fig.6). Their loci are given by\nr\u00b1 = exp(\u00b1|\u03b8|)\n\n(4.1)\n\n2\u03c0g(\u03b8) = 2\u03c0(g+ (\u03b8) + g\u2212 (\u03b8)) = 4\u2206c|\u03b8|.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe density of zeros is\n\n\f10\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\u221225\n\n\u221215\n\n\u22125\n\n5\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 6. (a) l = 0. The zeros for N |\u2206c| = 10 are plotted, with the same notation as before.\n(b) Magnification of the box in (a). Note that the two loci are now joined to form a single curve,\nand intersects the real axis at z = 1.0 with the angle of 45 degrees. Both \u2206c > 0 (Fig.4) and\n\u2206c < 0 (Fig.5) approach this limit as l \u2192 0.\n\nNote that g(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = 0, consistent with the fact that the first derivative of the\npartition function has no discontinuity. The loci intersect the real axis with the angles of\n45 degrees, and the intermediate region dominated by peak 1 with the smaller specific heat,\nwhich used to separate two domains dominated by peak 2 with the larger specific heat,\ntouches the real axis at just one point. Therefore the system is dominated by the peak 2\nfor t 6= 0, and the peak 1 has same weight as the peak 2 only at t = 0, when their positions\ncoincide. The qualitative behaviors of the two peaks for t > 0 and t < 0 are same as the\nones depicted in Fig.2(a) and Fig.2(d).\nTherefore the system is exhibiting a critical behavior where it is just on the verge of\nmaking a phase transition. However, in contrast to many familiar examples of critical\nbehavior, the specific heat near t = 0 remains finite instead of blowing up. At this stage it\nis not yet clear whether there is an example of a discrete system whose critical behavior at\nthe thermodynamic limit can be described by this model.\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea through\na grant to the Research Institute for Basic Sciences, Seoul National University, in part by the\nKorea Science Foundation through Research Grant to the Center for Theoretical Physics,\nSeoul National University, and in part by the Japanese Society for Promotion of Science\nthrough the Institute of Physics, University of Tokyo.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] C.N.Yang, in Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena Vol. 1 edited by C.
