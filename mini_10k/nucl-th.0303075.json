Final state interactions are included within the\ndistorted wave impulse approximation, by means of a relativistic optical potential, with and without\nimaginary part, and of a relativistic mean field potential. For comparison with experimental data\nthe inclusive charged\u2013current quasielastic cross section for \u03bd\u03bc \u201312 C scattering in the kinematical\nconditions of the LSND experiment at Los Alamos is also presented and briefly discussed.\nPACS numbers: 25.30.Pt; 13.15.+g; 24.10.Jv\n\nIn the past few years the observation of neutrino oscillations at Super\u2013Kamiokande [1] and the subsequent\nproposal and realization of new experiments, aimed at\ndetermining neutrino properties with high accuracy [2],\nhave renovated the interest towards neutrino scattering\non complex nuclei. In fact, neutrino detectors usually\ncontain carbon or oxygen nuclei, and for a proper interpretation of the experimental results the description of\nthe \u03bd\u2013nucleus interaction must be accurate [3].\nAt intermediate neutrino energies, ranging from some\nhundreds MeV to a few GeV, \u03bd\u2013nucleus quasielastic scattering has been studied within several approaches [4].\nRelativistic and non relativistic studies of Random Phase\nApproximation have shown nuclear structure effects to be\nrelevant only at low momentum transfers, but indications\nhave been found that for future and precise data analyses\nof, e.g., atmospheric neutrino measurements, more accurate theoretical estimates may be needed. Additionally,\nvery recently new attention has been drawn towards final\nstate interaction (FSI) effects, which, contrary to what is\noften assumed, may still be relevant even at the relatively\nhigh energy E\u03bd = 1 GeV [5].\nIn this contribution we study charged\u2013current (CC)\nneutrino\u2013nucleus quasielastic scattering within the\nframework of a Relativistic Shell Model (RSM), already\nsuccessfully employed to study exclusive electron scattering [6] and Neutral Current neutrino scattering [7]. We\ncompute inclusive \u03bd\u03bc \u201316 O quasielastic cross sections for\nthree values of the incident neutrino energy, namely 200\nMeV, 500 MeV, and 1 GeV, which are representative of\nthe kinematical range where quasielastic scattering gives\nthe main contribution to the inclusive \u03bd\u2013nucleus process.\nWe describe the CC quasielastic scattering of neutrinos\non a nuclear target within the Impulse Approximation\n(IA), assuming that the incident neutrino exchanges one\nvector boson with only one nucleon, which is then emitted, while the remaining (A-1) nucleons in the target are\nspectators. The nuclear current is assumed to be the sum\nof single nucleon currents, for which we employ the usual\n\nfree nucleon expression (see [7]) with the axial form factor\nparameterized as a dipole with cut\u2013off mass MA = 1.026\nGeV [8], and the states of the target and residual nuclei\nto be adequately described by an independent particle\nmodel wave function.\nTo describe the bound nucleon states we use Relativistic Shell Model wave functions, obtained as the self\u2013\nconsistent (Hartree) solutions of a Dirac equation, derived, within a Relativistic Mean Field approach, from\na Lagrangian containing \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons [9]. As the\nsingle-particle binding energies determine the threshold\nof the cross section for every shell, in the numerical calculations, we have used the experimental values corresponding to the binding energies of the different shells.\nFor the outgoing nucleon the simplest choice is to\nuse plane wave spinors, i.e., no interaction is considered between the ejected nucleon and the residual nucleus (PWIA). For a more realistic description, FSI effects should be taken into account. In our formalism this\nis done by using distorted waves which are given as solutions of a Dirac equation containing a phenomenological\nrelativistic optical potential (ROP), consisting of a real\npart, which describes the rescattering of the ejected nucleon and of an imaginary part, that accounts for the\nabsorption of it into unobserved channels. In this work\nwe use the ROP corresponding to the EDAD-1 singlenucleon parameterization presented in ref. [10]. The use\nof this phenomenological ROP leads to an excellent agreement between theoretical calculations and data for exclusive (e, e\u2032 N ) observables [6]; however some caution should\nbe taken in extending the conclusions drawn from the\nanalysis of exclusive reactions to inclusive ones. In the\nlatter, unless a selection of the single nucleon knockout\ncontribution is experimentally feasible, all final channels\nare included and thus the imaginary term in the optical\npotential leads to an overestimation of FSI effects. This\nis clearly illustrated in fig. 1 where we compare our theoretical results with the experimental cross section corresponding to inclusive quasielastic electron scattering on\n\n\f2\n40\nRMF\nreal ROP\ncomplex ROP\nRSM-PWIA\n\n30\n\n350\n\nd\u03c3/d T\u03bc (10-39 cm2/GeV)\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9d\u03c9 (nb sr MeV )\n\n35\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\nRSM-PWIA\nRFG, eB=0\nRFG, eB=20 MeV\n\n300\n250\n\n200 MeV\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120\n\u03c9 (MeV)\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nFIG. 1: Differential cross section (d\u03c3/d\u03a9d\u03c9) versus the energy transfer for inclusive quasielastic electron scattering on\n12\nC for a momentum transfer q \u2243 400 MeV/c.

In our\ncalculation besides the complex ROP, we also consider\nthe potential obtained by setting the imaginary part of\nthe ROP to zero. Additionally one may also use distorted waves which are obtained as the solutions in the\ncontinuum of the same Dirac equation used to describe\nthe initial bound nucleon. We refer to this approach, that\nshould be adequate to describe FSI at moderate energy\ntransfer, as relativistic mean field (RMF). As shown in\nfig. 1, the complex ROP results clearly underestimate the\ndata, while the reverse occurs for the PWIA calculation.\nOn the other hand, the RMF and purely real ROP agree\nmuch better with experiment, particularly RMF for small\ntransfer energy and real ROP for higher \u03c9. We believe\nthat the RMF and real ROP results indicate a reasonable\n\"band\" where FSI effects should lie.\nLet us now present our results for neutrino scattering on 16 O. To better illustrate our model, we start by\nneglecting FSI and comparing RSM\u2013PWIA results with\ninclusive cross sections obtained within the relativistic\nFermi gas (RFG) [7]. This is is done in fig. 2, which\nshows the differential cross section (d\u03c3/dT\u03bc ) as a function of the outgoing muon kinetic energy. With respect\nto the RFG curve calculated with no binding energy we\nobserve that the RSM cross section is reduced and shifted\ntowards lower T\u03bc values, in a way which is similar to the\neffect of an average binding energy in the RFG. In addition the RSM cross section has a different shape, due\nto the different momentum distributions of the single nucleon shells contributing to the process. Since the various\nshells have different binding energies, the corresponding\ncontributions to the cross section go to zero at differ-\n\nd\u03c3/d T\u03bc (10-39 cm2/GeV)\n\n350\n300\n250\n\nRSM-PWIA\nRFG, eB=0\nRFG, eB=20 MeV\n\n200\n150\n100\n\n1 GeV\n\n50\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n\nT\u03bc (MeV)\n\nFIG. 2: Differential cross section (d\u03c3/dT\u03bc ) versus the outgoing muon kinetic energy, for the quasielastic scattering of\nmuon neutrinos on 16 O and for three choices of the incident\nneutrino energy: E\u03bd = 200 MeV (upper panel), 500 MeV\n(middle) and 1 GeV (lower panel). The solid curves correspond to the RSM with no final state interaction, while the remaining curves are calculated within the RFG, with kF = 225\nMeV and eB = 0 (dot\u2013dashed) and eB = 20 MeV (dotted).\n\nent values of T\u03bc and this gives rise to the structure of\n(d\u03c3/dT\u03bc ) observed at large T\u03bc . Fig. 2 shows that nuclear model effects on the cross sections can be rather\nlarge at low neutrino energy, but become less relevant as\nE\u03bd increases, practically disappearing at E\u03bd = 1 GeV.\nOn the other hand, the behavior of FSI effects is quite\ndifferent, as illustrated in fig. 3.

All curves\nare calculated within the RSM model in PWIA (solid), and\nwithin the RMF (dashed), real ROP (dotted) and complex\nROP (dot\u2013dashed) approaches.\n\npotentials (RMF and real ROP) for describing the final\nnucleon states leads to the resonant structure observed\nfor relatively high T\u03bc (that is, small energy transfer \u03c9).\nNote that in this work we only include single-particle excitations within a mean field picture. Including residual\ninteractions would make the width and number of resonances to be considerably larger.\nWe observe that FSI effects produce a reduction of the\ncross section, particularly important in the case of the\ncomplex ROP model due to the absorption introduced by\nthe imaginary term: about 60% for E\u03bd = 200 MeV and\n50% for E\u03bd = 500 MeV and E\u03bd = 1 GeV in the region\nclose to the maximum. For the RMF and real ROP, the\n\nreduction, similar in both cases, is about 30 \u00f7 40% for\nE\u03bd = 200 MeV and 20% for the other energy values.\nNuclear model effects on integrated cross sections are\nstudied in fig. 4, where the cross section \u03c3(E\u03bd ) is plotted as a function of the incident neutrino energy. Here\nthe contributions coming from the RMF and ROP resonances have been included in the calculation, in order\nto respect the completeness of the set of final states predicted by the model. These contributions are important\nat E\u03bd = 200 MeV, where they amount to about 10% of\nthe integrated cross section, while at higher energies these\neffects are about 2% (500 MeV) and 1% (1 GeV). Again\nwe see that within the PWIA the discrepancy between\ndifferent nuclear models is relatively small and decreases\nwith increasing neutrino energy. On the contrary FSI\neffects remain sizeable even at large E\u03bd . As in the previous figure, the imaginary term in the ROP leads to a too\nlarge reduction (\u223c 50%) of the integrated cross section.\nThe results for the RMF and real ROP models, which are\nmore reliable, show a smaller, but still sizeable (\u223c 15%\nat E\u03bd = 1 GeV) reduction.\nThe results shown in figs. 3 and 4 lead us to conclude\nthat FSI effects should be carefully considered in neutrino\nexperiments which use oxygen based detectors. Analogous conclusions can be drawn for the case of a 12 C\ntarget.\nFor the purpose of comparison with the experiment,\nlet us consider the inclusive 12 C(\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 )X cross section\nmeasured by the LSND collaboration at Los Alamos, using a pion\u2013Decay\u2013in\u2013Flight \u03bd\u03bc beam, with energies rang-\n\n\f4\nsider our FSI approach to be useful to estimate integrated\ncross sections.\n\nRMF\nreal ROP\nRSM-PWIA\n\n20\n\n2\n\ncm /MeV)\n\n25\n\nd\u03c3/dT\u03bc (10\n\n-42\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nT\u03bc (MeV)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFIG. 5: Observed distribution of muon kinetic energies T\u03bc\ncompared with the flux\u2013averaged predictions of our RSM,\nin PWIA (dotted line) and including FSI within the RMF\n(solid) and purely real ROP (dashed) frameworks. The theoretical distributions have been normalized to give the same\nintegrated values as the experimental points, and have been\nfolded in energy with a bin size of 5 MeV, the same employed\nfor the experimental data. Data are from Albert et al. [12].\n\nIn fig. 5 we show the observed [12] and calculated distribution of events, averaged over the 1994 Los Alamos\nneutrino spectrum \u03c6(E\u03bd ) within the energy range E\u03bd =\n123.1 \u00f7 300 MeV. The shape and position of the maximum of the experimental distribution are approximately\nreproduced by the three calculations, but the results that\ninclude FSI with the RMF potential are clearly favored\nby the data. This is consistent with the fact that including FSI with the mean field potential should be adequate\nat moderate kinetic energy of the ejected nucleon. However the values we obtain for the the flux\u2013averaged integrated cross section overestimate the measured cross section by approximately 50%. More precisely, in the RSM,\nwe obtain h\u03c3i = 20.5 (PWIA), 16.8 (RMF) and 15.1 (real\nROP) 10\u221240 cm2 . Additional corrections due to the outgoing muon Coulomb distortion, evaluated within the effective momentum approximation [14], further increase\nthese numbers by 5 \u00f7 10%. The corresponding final measured experimental value is 10.6\u00b10.3\u00b11.8 10\u221240 cm2 [12].\nAcknowledgements\n\ning from muon threshold to 300 MeV, and a large liquid\nscintillator detector [12].
