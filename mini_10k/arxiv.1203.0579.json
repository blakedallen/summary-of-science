The gap equation is used to\nconsider which superconducting order parameters are most favorable assuming a pairing interaction that is peaked at (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ) - the wavevector for the antiferromagnetic ordering found in close\nproximity. In addition to the commonly accepted dx2 \u2212y2 order parameter, there is evidence that an\nextended s-wave order parameter with nodes is also plausible. We discuss whether these results are\nconsistent with current observations and possible measurements that could help distinguish between\nthese scenarios.\nPACS numbers: 74.20.Mn, 71.27.+a, 74.70.Tx\n\nCeCoIn5 is a heavy fermion superconductor[1], which has been shown to lie in close proximity to an antiferromagnetic\nquantum critical point [2\u20134]. Its structure consists of layers of square planar Ce atoms, similar in that respect to\nthe cuprate superconductors. Soon after the discovery of superconductivity in CeCoIn5 many measurements were\nperformed that were consistent with lines of nodes in the superconducting gap, including specific heat, thermal\nconductivity [5], spin-lattice relaxation rate [6], and penetration depth [7]. Ideally, ARPES measurements could\nreveal the anisotropic gap structure in k-space, but current equipment has neither the energy resolution nor the\ntemperature range to perform such a study. In its absence probes which are directionally weighted averages over\nthe Fermi surface have been used to identify the location of the nodes, including field-angle dependent specific heat\nand thermal conductivity[8\u201311], Hc2 (\u03b8)[12] point contact Andreev reflection measurements[13], and vortex lattice\nstructure [14, 15] all of which now argue that nodes lie along the \u0393 \u2192 (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ) direction in the tetragonal Brillouin\nzone. In addition, a neutron scattering resonance has been observed at (\u03c0,\u03c0,\u03c0) which can be interpreted as consistent\nwith dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry[16]. Taken together the experimental evidence appears fairly compelling that CeCoIn5 is a\nsuperconductor with a dx2 \u2212y2 gap structure. Measurements on other members in this family are relatively scarce\ndue to the fact that either pressure is required for superconductivity to occur (as in CeRhIn5 , CeIn3 , Ce2 RhIn8 , and\nCePt2 In7 [17\u201320]) or there are radioactive considerations (for PuCoGa5 , PuRhGa5 , and PuCoIn5 [21\u201323]). However,\nwith the exception of a few measurements [24] those measurements which have been made on these compounds are\nidentical to the results found for CeCoIn5 [25\u201330].\nOn the theoretical side, the BCS theory of superconductivity allows one to calculate the superconducting gap\nstructure at T = 0 K by solving the gap equation:\n\u2206(k) = \u2212\n\nX\nk0\n\n\u0393(k, k0 ) p\n\n\u2206(k0 )\n|\u000fk0 |2 + |\u2206(k0 )|2\n\n,\n\nwhere \u2206(k) is the superconducting gap function, \u000fk is the electronic dispersion, and \u0393(k, k0 ) is the pairing interaction.\nTo solve this equation the low energy electronic structure (ie. the Fermi surface, and effective masses) and the\npairing interaction \u0393(k, k0 ) must be known. This would appear to be a formidable if not impossible task for such\nstrongly correlated materials such as the cuprates or the heavy fermion materials which we wish to study[31]. It is\nwell known that for strongly correlated materials there are no well controlled approximations for calculating their\nproperties. However, it does appear from several cases that simple density functional theory (DFT) calculations\nprovide a reasonable starting point for computing Fermi surfaces in good agreement with experiment, even if the\nmass renormalization can be off by orders of magnitude [32\u201334]. The computation of the pairing interaction is more\nproblematic. In weak coupling spin fluctuation theory, however, one may approximate \u0393(k, k0 ) by a renormalized\nspin susceptibility U \u03c7S (q, \u03c9)U where U is the screened Coulomb potential [35\u201339]. Whether or not this is rigorously\ntrue in the strongly correlated materials of interest, such as the cuprates, pnictides, and heavy fermions, remains\na subject of debate, but at least in the case of the cuprates and the iron based superconductors, the observed gap\nphenomenology can be reasonably described utilizing this assumption [40, 41].\nMore specifically, from either a strong coupling, weak coupling, or experimental perspective the spin susceptibility\nof the cuprates is peaked at (\u03c0,\u03c0). Given the LDA determined Fermi surface with the largest density of states near\n(\u00b1\u03c0,0) and (0,\u00b1\u03c0) the order parameter which will naturally maximize the superconducting gap is a dx2 \u2212y2 order\nparameter. In the Fe-based superconductors such as doped LaFeAsO and BaFe2 As2 the spin susceptibility is peaked\n\n\f2\nat (\u03c0,0). In this case, the combination of a hole pocket centered at the \u0393 point, and an electron pocket at the X\npoint (of the unfolded Brillouin zone) leads to the suggestion of the so-called s\u00b1 gap structure [42\u201345]. Furthermore,\nweak coupling approaches can calculate the variations in the spin susceptibility for different dopings and crystal\nstructures. Inputting the renormalized spin susceptibility and electronic structure leads to strong gap variations and\noften accidental nodes which are consistent with many of the experimental observations[41]\nSince most of the experimental evidence for d-wave symmetry in the 115 materials is indirect, the story of the\nFe-based superconductors compels us to reconsider the possible superconducting order parameters in the 115 family\nof superconductors, which are also compensated multiband metals like the Fe-based materials. The goal of this\nwork is not to conclusively show which order parameter is correct in the various 115 materials. Rather, we assume\na BCS-like formalism for the superconductivity with a repulsive interaction that is peaked in the vicinity of the\nnearby long range magnetic order and explore whether the d-wave order parameters are the only likely candidates for\nsuperconductivity. We find that alternative scenarios are at least plausible particularly for the Pu-based materials.\nFor completeness it must be stated that it is also not obvious whether a BCS picture such as this is even the correct\nstarting point to understand superconductivity in these materials, or whether other q vectors should be considered\nfor the pairing interaction. However, in the absence of a microscopic theory the phenomenology at least is consistent\nwith what is known about cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, and if it can be shown to be consistent in the heavy\nfermion superconductors as well, it provides a methodology by which one can tailor higher Tc 's within a family of\nsuperconductors without detailed knowledge of the pairing mechanism.\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (top) Three Fermi surface sheets of CeCoIn5 . (bottom right) The Fermi surfaces of PuCoIn5 .\n\nThe WIEN2K code[46] is used to calculate the electronic structure using the generalized gradient approximation\nand adopting the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation potentials[47]. We included spin orbit interactions\non the f -electrons with a second variational method.\nIn the Ce-based 115s the evidence is fairly clear that the spin susceptibility is peaked at (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ). For CeIn3 ,\nCeRhIn5 , CeCoIn5 , Ce2 RhIn8 , and CePt2 In7 , it has been shown that a dome of superconductivity emerges around\na quantum critical point associated with the suppression of an antiferromagnetically ordered phase with QAF =\n(\u03c0,\u03c0,\u03b4)[48\u201354]. We expect a similar situation to exist for Ce2 PdIn8 and Ce2 CoIn8 [55, 56]. Furthermore, the neutron\nresonance observed in the superconducting state of CeCoIn5 [16], is either a result of the gapping of the spin excitations present at Q = (\u03c0,\u03c0,\u03c0)[57] or a consequence of the pairing interaction being peaked at this wavevector[58].\nConsequently, assuming a uniform U the pairing interaction is indeed peaked at Q = (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ) for all of the Ce-based\nsuperconductors listed above.\nIn Fig. 1, we show the Fermi surface for CeCoIn5 . It is a very complicated 3D Fermi surface. Tight binding models\noften approximate the Fermi surface in the 115s by multiple cylindrical electron Fermi surfaces centered at (\u03c0,\u03c0,kz )\nand a hole like Fermi surface centered at \u0393(e.g. [59]). For the purpose of discussion a cartoon of the resulting Fermi\nsurface is shown in Fig. 2 for kz =0.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Cartoon Fermi surface of the 115's in the (kx , ky ) plane. The wavevector Q = (\u03c0,\u03c0) represents where\nthe pairing fluctuations are likely maximal assuming a constant U and orbital matrix elements. Depending on which states\nthey dominantly pair (ie. Q1 or Q2 ) will dictate which order parameter symmetry is most favorable.\n\nWe now ask the question of what gap symmetry is favored by such a Fermi surface with a pairing potential that is\npeaked at (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ). From Eq. (1) the order parameter will be chosen so that the maximal number of states within the\ngap energy of the Fermi energy which are separated by the wave vector Q = (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ) can have an order parameter\nwith opposite sign (ie. \u2206(k) = - \u2206(k + Q)). As in the cuprates, this results in a dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry when a large DOS\nexists at (\u03c0,0,kz ) and equivalent points. This certainly is a possibility for the 115s as emphasized in Fig. 2 by the\nvector Q1 . However, a second possibility is that the fluctuations strongly pair the states on different Fermi surface\nsheets (e.g. those sheets labeled \u03b1 and \u000f in Fig. 2 with vector Q2 ). This situation is analogous to the Fe-based\nsuperconductors[42\u201345]. Consequently, an s\u00b1 type pairing symmetry, belonging to the A1g representation where the\norder parameter changes sign between different Fermi surface sheets, would be favored. Given the complexity of\nthe actual Fermi surface, and the need to overcome the strong onsite Coulomb repulsion U [60, 61] it is likely that\naccidental nodes exist if the s\u00b1 order parameter was the dominant order parameter. If the coupling between Fermi\nsurface sheets is sufficiently weak then it is also possible to have different symmetry representations on different Fermi\nsurface sheets (ie. s\u00b1 on \u03b1 and \u03b3 and dx2 \u2212y2 on \u03b2) [62, 63].\nAs an initial investigation to determine whether an s\u00b1 or a dx2 \u2212y2 order parameter is more likely to occur in any\nparticular 115 compound we examine the band structure more closely. One should consider the states which once\nrenormalized to account for the enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat are within the spin fluctuation\nenergy of EF . dHvA measurements show that the experimentally measured Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with\nthose computed using non-interacting DFT theory [32]. Thus, even though the mass renormalization is not correct,\nthe DFT computed electronic structure should give a reasonable first guess as to the leading pairing instability. We\nsuggest that the dx2 \u2212y2 order parameter will be dominant when the majority of states are found near (\u03c0,0,kz ) and\nequivalent points, while the s\u00b1 order parameter will be favored when the majority of states are found near the (0,0,kz )\nand (\u03c0,\u03c0,kz ) points. For completeness all representations consistent with the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice should\nbe considered[64], but given the crudeness of this analysis for simplicity we only consider the dx2 \u2212y2 and s\u00b1 order\nparameters as the most likely scenarios.\nFig. 3 shows the band structure for several Ce-based superconducting materials, which are consistent with other\nband structure calculations where available [32, 59]. For the 115s there are states near \u0393 and a large cylindrical\nFermi surface centered at (\u03c0,\u03c0,kz ) which could favor an s\u00b1 order parameter, but especially when considering the\nentire kz dispersion, there are significantly more states available for superconductivity near (\u03c0,0,kz ) and equivalent\npoints which would indeed favor dx2 \u2212y2 pairing. A non-uniform renormalization in k-space or strong variations in\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) (a) Band structure from top to bottom of CeCoIn5 , Ce2 CoIn8 , Ce2 PdIn8 and CePt2 In7 . The size of the\npoints reflects the amount of f -character. (b) Zoom of panel (a).\n\norbital character could easily shift the preference to an alternative order parameter. dHvA results indeed indicate\nthat the mass renormalization is nonuniform across momentum space. However, they show that the small pocket\naround the \u0393 point is actually the lightest band [32] which thus further supports the dx2 \u2212y2 gap structure over s\u00b1.\nWhile theoretical studies of the order parameter in the 115's generally favor dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry [65, 66], a study of the\norbitally degenerate Hubbard model with tight binding parameters for the 115s also found alternative representations\ndepending on the Coulomb and crystal field parameters [67].\nWe also show the band structures for Ce2 PdIn8 , Ce2 CoIn8 , and CePt2 In7 in Fig. 3. The 218's can be visualized\nas a bilayer variant of the 115 structure. Indeed near 0.2 eV a doubling of the number of bands is clearly visible\n(especially clear near (\u03c0,\u03c0,kz )). However, the number of Fermi surface sheets remains unchanged and the electronic\nstructure near EF is qualitatively similar between Ce2 CoIn8 and CeCoIn5 . The electronic structure of Ce2 PdIn8 near\nEF is similar to Ce2 CoIn8 with a small shift of the chemical potential reflecting the extra electron of Pd relative\nto Co, although it is clearly not a rigid shift. Finally, for CePt2 In7 , the additional PtIn2 bands relative to the 115\nstructure does result in additional Fermi surface sheets, although quite similar in structure to the other large Fermi\nsurface sheets[68]. While the details vary, the main features observed in the band structure of CeCoIn5 persist in\nthese three other compounds as well. Namely, the dominant weight is found close to the (\u03c0,0,kz ) points suggesting\ndominantly dx2 \u2212y2 gap symmetry. The magnetism and superconductivity present in the 115's appears robust to these\nminor changes in the electronic structure.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the analogous band structures for the Pu-based superconductors, again in agreement with\nprevious publications [69\u201372]. As seen in Fig. 1, the Fermi surface of PuCoIn5 is qualitatively similar to CeCoIn5 ,\nwith respect to cylindrical-like Fermi surface sheets centered at (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ), a small hole pocket near \u0393 and a large\nFermi surface sheet. However, one can also tell that in PuCoIn5 , the hole pocket is larger, the cylindrical sheets are\ncloser to (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ), and there is less weight near (\u03c0,0,qz ) and equivalent points. Note, that in the case of the Pu-based\nsuperconductors it is much less clear where to guess the pairing fluctuations might be peaked since the analogous long\nrange order has yet to be found. However, for the purpose of this discussion we will again assume that the pairing\nfluctuations are peaked at (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz ). This is indeed what one would assume on the basis of a uniform U spin fluctuation\ncalculation [73]. In contrast to the case of the Ce-based superconductors the arguments for dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry are much\nless conclusive. Relative to the Ce-based materials there are fewer states in the vicinity of (\u03c0,0,kz ) and more states\nnear the Fermi level at (\u03c0,\u03c0,kz ). This leads us to speculate that the potential for an s\u00b1 order parameter is greater in\nthe case of Pu-based 115s than in the case of Ce-based 115s. Note also that in contrast to the Ce-based compounds,\n\n\f5\nthe bare f level is situated directly at the Fermi level in these Pu compounds. As a consequence, the bilayer variants\nsuch as Pu2 CoGa8 have dramatically different electronic structure relative to PuCoGa5 . This is a possible reason for\nwhy superconductivity is much less prevalent in the relatives of the Pu-based 115s [72, 74], while it is much more\nrobust in the Ce-based 115's.\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) (a) Band structure from top to bottom of PuCoGa5 , PuCoIn5 and Pu2 CoGa8 (which is not superconducting). The size of the points reflects the amount of f -character. (b) Zoom of panel (a)\n\nWe now briefly reconsider the experimental evidence for the position of the nodes in these materials. Ideally, field\nangle specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements can give the position of the nodes. However, they rely on\nthe ability to accurately model the true electronic structure, which as we have emphasized, is poorly understood in\nheavy fermion materials. Furthermore, a similar 4-fold modulation has also been reported in some of the Fe-based\nsuperconductors [75, 76]. Similarly, while the point contact Andreev spectroscopy data could differentiate in favor of\na dx2 \u2212y2 order parameter relative to a dxy order parameter, more work is needed for a realistic electronic structure\nwhether alternative gap structures including s\u00b1 with accidental nodes are possible [13, 77]. We also find it interesting\nthat the universal limit of the residual term in the thermal conductivity [78] is not obeyed with La-doping in CeCoIn5\n[79]. This likely reflects the multiband nature of superconductivity in these materials [80].\nWhat experiments could help resolve the question of the order parameter in these systems? Based on similar work\nwhich is being proposed to differentiate various gap symmetries in the Fe-based superconductors it is easy to propose\nsimilar measurements for the Ce- and Pu-based 115 superconductors, even though we acknowledge that temperature,\npressure, and radioactive constraints may make many of these measurements very difficult. Certainly, phase sensitive\nexperiments as done on cuprates [81, 82] would clearly be the most definitive tests of the order parameter. Additional\nstudies such as examining details of impurity states with scannning tunneling microscopy[83] and the quasiparticle\ninterference pattern[84], the neutron resonance [85], and Andreev bound states [86] are a few examples of probes\nthat will further help distinguish between different possible order parameters. In the exceptional case of the 20 K\nPuCoGa5 superconductor, ARPES measurements are obviously also potentially enlightening. Note, that one should\nalso consider the possibility that the order parameter may change (and could gain/lose nodes) as a function of tuning\nparameters such as pressure or doping [87], as has been suggested in the Fe-based superconductors.\nWe have examined the band structures for various Ce- and Pu-based superconductors within the 115 family. Based\non the assumption of pairing fluctuations which are peaked at qx = qy = \u03c0 we find that the dx2 \u2212y2 order parameter\nis the likely candidate for superconductivity in the Ce-based materials. However, we also find that the s\u00b1 order\nparameter may be favored if an anisotropic mass renormalization favors the gapping between states in the vicinity\nof (0,0,qz ) and (\u03c0,\u03c0,qz0 ). Experimentally this does not appear to be the case in CeCoIn5 , but it is a much stronger\npossibility for the Pu-based superconductors. The purpose of this survey is to stimulate further discussion of the\norder parameter in the 115 based superconductors. Future theoretical and experimental work is needed to clarify the\norder parameter in these materials.\n\n\f6\nAcknowledgements\n\nWork at Los Alamos National Laboratory was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy\npartially under Contract No. DE-AC52-06NA25396, the Office of Science (BES), Los Alamos LDRD, and a NERSC\ncomputing allocation under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.
