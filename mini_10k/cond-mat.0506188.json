One system which appears to provide an\nexample of such physics is La2 CuO4 , which is a Mott insulating antiferromagnet. Indeed, high resolution data on\nthe magnon dispersion in this system indicate a dip in the\nmagnon energy near Q = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) while traversing the\nmagnetic Brillouin zone boundary along (\u03c0, 0) \u2192 (0, \u03c0).\nSuch a dip is not expected for the magnon dispersion\nin a nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet, but it\nhas been suggested2 that this could arise from four-spin\ninteractions generated by local charge fluctuations in the\ninsulating phase. Motivated by this, we revisit the zero\ntemperature N\u00e9el ordered state of La2 CuO4 , and examine how the spin stiffness, the ordered moment, the effective local moment at a site, and the spin dynamics\nare influenced by local charge fluctuations in this Mott\ninsulator.\nLa2 CuO4 is a layered antiferromagnet. While the exchange coupling between the two-dimensional layers is\ncrucial for the existence of a finite-temperature N\u00e9el transition in this system, this interplane coupling is nevertheless tiny in magnitude, \u223c 10\u22125 of the in-plane exchange\ncoupling, and much smaller than the resolution of the\nneutron scattering experiments. It is therefore expected\nthat the low temperature spin dynamics in the N\u00e9el ordered state in this material is adequately captured by\nthe Hubbard model at zero temperature on a two dimensional square lattice, (with standard notations)\n\u0011\nX\nX \u0010 \u2020\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\n(1)\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c. + U\nH = \u2212t\nhiji,\u03c3\n\ni\n\nin its insulating phase at strong coupling U \u226b t. In this\nregime, it is well known3,4 that the low energy physics can\n\nbe encapsulated in an effective spin Hamiltonian which\nincorporates two-spin and four-spin interactions (given\nbelow in Eq. 2).\nA detailed analysis of a spin model with such four-spin\ninteractions was carried out by Katanin and Kampf5 using modified spin wave theory. This allowed them to conclude that a fit to the magnon dispersion indeed requires\nsizeable four-spin interactions, as originally suggested by\nColdea et al2 based on linear spin wave theory. A different approach to this problem was adopted by Singh and\nGoswami6 and Peres and Ara\u00fajo7 who used the randomphase approximation (RPA) for the Hubbard model with\na spin density wave ground state. This is presumably a\nbetter approximation at weak coupling but nevertheless\nalso reproduces the dip in the magnon dispersion near\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) at intermediate values of U/t.\nIn this paper, we use Schwinger boson mean field theory to study the magnon dispersion and scattering continuum for the effective spin model in Eq. (2). There are\nseveral reasons to try this route. First, in contrast to the\nRPA studies, this approach of mapping to an effective\nspin model is explicitly geared towards addressing the\nstrong coupling limit U/t \u226b 1. It is therefore interesting\nto compare the two approximations at the intermediate\ncoupling values of experimental interest, especially taking\ninto account modifications to the spin operator which result when going from the Hubbard electronic description\nto an effective spin model. Indeed, it is satisfying that\nsome of the results obtained here are consistent with the\nspin-density wave approach for intermediate U/t. Second, Schwinger boson mean field theory is known to work\nwell for the square lattice Heisenberg model and it is\nworth asking if it continues to be reliable once sizeable\nfour-spin interactions are included, and how such interactions affect the ground state properties and the magnon\ndispersion. Finally, we consider the scattering continuum\nbeyond the magnon peak in La2 CuO4 which has not been\naddressed sufficiently in these earlier papers. (While this\n\n\f2\npaper was being refereed, a closely related work8 which\ndiscusses the sum-rule and other issues with neutron scattering experiments in La2 CuO4 was submitted for publication. We have therefore added a brief discussion of\nsum-rules within our approach, and refer the reader to\nthe above paper for a detailed analysis of sum rules, the\ncurrent status of neutron scattering experiments and alternative theoretical approaches to spin dynamics in this\nsystem.)\nA summary of our main new results is given below.\n(i) Comparing the mean field theory results for the\nground state energy and static spin structure factor with\nexact diagonalization studies on small clusters, we show\nthat the mean field theory provides a good description of\nthe ground state of the spin model (2), in the experimentally relevant regime.\n(ii) We show that the experimental magnon dispersion is well reproduced by our approach for Hubbard\nmodel parameters U \u2248 2.34eV , and t \u2248 360meV . These\nparameter values are in reasonable agreement with the\nexperimental estimates9 of U , and electronic structure\ncalculations10 for t. Our estimated ratio U/t \u2248 6.5 is in\nrough agreement with the value inferred from RPA calculations for the Hubbard model6,7 as well as the quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) calculations of Sengupta et al.,11\nthough we do not resort to the single mode approximation used by the latter authors. It is however slightly\nsmaller than the ratio U/t \u2248 8.8 obtained from a recent\nseries expansion study of the Hubbard model12 .\n(iii) Our best fit parameters for t, U lead to values for\nthe staggered magnetization ms \u2248 0.25, spin wave velocity c \u2248 800 meV -\u00c5, and spin stiffness \u03c1s \u2248 24meV . The\nspin wave velocity and spin stiffness are in good agreement with experimental findings.13 The staggered moment is substantially reduced from that of the Heisenberg model due to local charge fluctuations, as was earlier pointed out by Delannoy et al,14 and it may be worth\nrevisiting this in experiments.\n(iv) Turning to the spin excitation spectrum beyond\nthe magnon, we find that there is a broad continuum of\nexcitations at energy scales relevant to neutron scattering experiments. In addition, the spin-flip operator in the\nHubbard model induces transitions into the upper Hubbard band which would show up at energies of O(U ).\nWe however restrict attention in this paper to energies\nwell below the Mott gap, where a spin model description\nis appropriate. In this regime, we find that, along the\nzone boundary, the spectral weight in the continuum is\nabout 40% of the total spectral weight. This is similar to\nthe large continuum spectral weight inferred from QMC\ncalculations on the Heisenberg model,15 but we cannot\nmake any quantitative comparisons at this stage. Turning to the spectral lineshape at energy scales relevant to\nneutron scattering experiments, we find that the dynamical structure factor exhibits secondary peaks within the\nmean field theory.\n(v) The local charge fluctuations in the Hubbard model\nalso lead to a smaller effective local moment. To ob-\n\ntain this effective moment, we consider integrating the\ndynamical structure factor over energies well below the\nMott gap, as relevant for neutron scattering experiments,\nand then integrating this \"low-energy\" equal-time structure factor S\u0303low (q) over q. This leads to the sum-rule\nP\nq S\u0303low (q) = Seff (Seff + 1), with Seff < S = 1/2. Our\ncalculation gives Seff \u2243 0.39.\nIt is possible that all these features could be explored\nin neutron scattering experiments with higher resolution\nand intensity in the near future.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE SPIN MODEL\n\nThe effective spin model describing the strong coupling\nregime of the Hubbard model in (1) takes the form\nX h\n1X\n~1 * S\n~2 )(S\n~3 * S\n~4 )\n~i * S\n~j +\nJ(ri \u2212 rj )S\nJ\u2737 (S\n2 i,j\n\u2737\ni\n~1 * S\n~4 )(S\n~2 * S\n~3 ) \u2212 (S\n~1 * S\n~3 )(S\n~2 * S\n~4 ) .\n+ (S\n(2)\n\nHspin =\n\n~i are spin-half operators, and J\u2737 refers to an elHere, S\nementary plaquette on the square lattice with 1 \u2212 4 labeling sites on its corners. The explicit expressions for\nthe exchange couplings in terms of the Hubbard model\nparameters are4 ,\nt2\nt4\n\u2212 24 3\nU\nU\nt4\n= Jx\u0302+\u0177 = Jx\u0302\u2212\u0177 = 4 3\nU\nt4\n= J2x\u0302 = J2\u0177 = 4 3\nU\nt4\n= 80 3\nU\n\nJ1 = Jx\u0302 = J\u0177 = 4\n\n(3)\n\nJ2\n\n(4)\n\nJ3\nJ\u2737\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nWith hopping matrix elements between further neighbor\nsites in the Hubbard model, we expect additional couplings in the effective spin Hamiltonian. However, electronic structure calculations10 suggest that these matrix\nelements are small in magnitude for La2 CuO4 , so we will\nnot consider them here.\n\nIII.\n\nSCHWINGER BOSON MEAN FIELD\nTHEORY\n\nTo study the ground state and excitations of Hspin , we\nfollow Ref. 16 and represent spins using two species of\nbosons b1,2 as\n~i = b\u2020 ~\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 b\nS\ni\u03b1\ni\u03b2\n\n(7)\n\nb\u2020i\u03b1 bi\u03b1 = 2S\n\n(8)\n\nwith the constraint\n\n\f3\non the boson number at each site. The ~\u03c3 are Pauli matrices, the spin S = 1/2 for our system and, unless specified,\nthe summation over repeated Greek indices is implied\nhere and below. The Hamiltonian can be reexpressed in\nterms of the bosons by using the identity\n~i * S\n~j =:\nS\n\n\u2020\nBij\nBij\n\n:\n\n\u2212A\u2020ij Aij\n\n,\n\nAij\n\n(11)\n\nIn the exact Schwinger boson representation, the Hamiltonian obtained using the above identity consists of 4boson and 8-boson operators, and one has in addition\nto deal with the boson number constraint (8). In order\nto make progress we can resort to a mean field approach.\nApplied to the Hamiltonian Hspin in Eq. (2), this consists\nof three approximations. (i) First, we reduce the 4-spin\ninteractions to effective 2-spin terms by setting\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThis renormalizes the two-spin exchange couplings J(ri \u2212\nrj ) \u2192 J eff (ri \u2212 rj ) in Hspin .

In order to assess the accuracy of this approximation scheme in presence of the four-spin interaction term it is useful to compare the mean-field estimates of ground state properties with exact diagonalization numerics. To this end,\nwe have performed Lanczos exact \u221a\ndiagonalizations\n\u221a\n\u221a of\u221athe\nspin Hamiltonian (2) on the 4 \u00d7 4, 20\u00d7 20, 32\u00d7 32\nand 6 \u00d7 6 clusters. In particular we have focused on\nexchange interactions corresponding to U/t \u2192 \u221e (the\nHeisenberg limit), and U/t = 6.5, for which the mean\nfield theory fits the experimental magnon dispersion of\nLa2 CuO4 as discussed in the next section.

We can\ntake this into account by noticing that the spin operator\nof the Hubbard model is modified by the same unitary\ntransformation which enables us to rotate from the Hubbard model Hamiltonian to the Heisenberg model with\nfour-spin interactions of Eq. (2) which has no charge fluctuations. This transformation was discussed earlier in\nthe context of various physical correlations in the doped\ncuprate superconductors18 , and its importance for spin\nphysics in the undoped Mott insulator was pointed out\nby Delannoy et al.14\nFor instance, making the unitary transformation on\nthe spin operator S + (r), we find\n\nj\n\nThe results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 clearly show that\nthe Schwinger boson approach is still rather accurate\neven for large four-spin interactions which are generated\nfor a moderate interaction strength U/t = 6.5. We next\nturn to the staggered magnetization and spin stiffness in\nthe thermodynamic limit for this parameter value, taking into account the modification of the spin operator by\nlocal charge fluctuations.\n\nX\nt2\nt2\n)+ 2\nS + (r + \u03b1)\n2\nU\nU\n\u03b1=\u00b1x\u0302,\u00b1\u0177\n\u0010\n\u0011\nc\u2020r+\u03b1,\u2191 cr,\u2193 \u2212 c\u2020r,\u2191 cr+\u03b1,\u2193\n(32)\n\nS\u0303 + (r) = S + (r)(1 \u2212 4\n\u2212\n\nt\nU\n\nX\n\n\u03b1=\u00b1x\u0302,\u00b1\u0177\n\nWhile the first two terms lead to spin flips within the\nlower Hubbard band, the last term excites an electron\ninto the upper Hubbard band. This final term plays a\nrole at high energies, of O(U ), and short distances19 . We\nwill therefore not consider it below, but restrict attention to energies well below the Mott gap, where the first\n\n\f5\ntwo terms alone play a role and our spin-only description\nis valid. With this caveat, we find at O(t/U )2 we find\nthat the transformed \"low energy\" equal-time spin-spin\ncorrelation function is given by\n~\n~ \u2032 )i(1 \u2212 8\nS\u0303low (r \u2212 r\u2032 ) = hS(r)\n* S(r\n+\n\nt2\nU2\n\nX\n\n\u03b1=\u00b1x\u0302,\u00b1\u0177\n\nt2\n)\nU2\n\n~ + \u03b1) * S(r\n~ \u2032 )i\nhS(r\n\n~\n~ \u2032 + \u03b1)i\n+hS(r)\n* S(r\n\n(33)\n\nWithin Schwinger boson mean field theory, we obtain\nthe antiferromagnetic order parameter ms from finite-size\nscaling of the static structure factor, defined via\nX\nS\u0303low (rj \u2212 r0 )e\u2212iq*(rj \u2212r0 ) ,\n(34)\nS\u0303low (q) =\nj\n\nas\nm2s =\n\nS\u0303low (\u03c0, \u03c0)\n.\nNsite \u2192\u221e\nNsite\nlim\n\n(35)\n\nWe find that the staggered magnetization for U/t = 6.5\nextrapolates to ms \u2248 0.25, smaller than that for the\nnearest-neighbor Heisenberg model (mnn\ns \u2248 0.303). This\ndecrease of the staggered magnetization is due to local charge fluctuations in the insulator, and arises from\nO(t/U )2 terms in the modified spin operator in Eq. (32)\nas pointed out in Ref. 14.\nFor a pure spin model of the copper sites in La2 CuO4 ,\nwe expect\nthe sum-rule on the equal-time structure facP\ntor q S(q) = S(S + 1) with S = 1/2. However, with\nthe above modification to the spin correlations, this sumrule is corrected by terms of order (t/U )2 . Specifically,\nimagine integrating the dynamical structure factor over\nenergies relevant to neutron scattering experiments, i.e.\nmuch smaller than the Mott gap, and then integrating this \"low-energy\" equal-time structure factor S\u0303low (q)\nover\nP all q. In this case, we find the modified relation\nq S\u0303low (q) = Seff (Seff + 1) with Seff \u2243 0.39. It would\nbe interesting to look for this apparent sum-rule deficit\nin neutron scattering studies.\nFollowing Stringari20 , we extract the spin stiffness from\nthe small momentum behavior of the structure factor.\nSpecifically, approaching the magnetically ordered state\nin a rotationally invariant formulation, the static structure factor for small q is related to the spin stiffness\nthrough\n\u03c1s =\n\ncS\u0303(q \u2192 0)\nq\n\n(36)\n\nwhere c is the spin wave velocity of the linearly dispersing\nmagnon at momenta near (0, 0) and (\u03c0, \u03c0). The spinwave velocity c can be obtained from the magnon dispersion as discussed in connection with the excitation\nspectrum in the next section. This, together with the\ncalculated structure factor in the limit, q \u2192 0, yields the\n\nspin stiffness through Eq. (36). As discussed in detail in\nthe next section, a fit to the overall magnon dispersion\nin La2 CuO4 yields a spin wave velocity c \u2248 800meV -\u00c5.\nAssuming a lattice spacing 3.85\u00c5 for the CuO2 plane,\nthis yields \u03c1s \u2248 24meV , which is consistent with experimental findings.13 Note that the spin stiffness can also be\nobtained by studying the change in ground state energy\nfor a slowly varying spin twist.\nV.\n\nEXCITATION SPECTRUM\n\nTo probe the spectrum of S = 1 excitations at a\ngiven momentum q, which is of interest for neutron\nscattering experiments, one can act with the operator\nP\nS + (q) = k b\u2020k,1 bk\u2212q,2 onto the ground state20,22 . Making a Bogoliubov rotation to spinon variables, we can\nrewrite this as\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u2020\nS + (q) =\nuk fk\u2191 \u2212 vk f\u2212k\u2193\nk\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\n\u00d7 uk\u2212q fk\u2212q,\u2191 \u2212 vk\u2212q f\u2212k+q,\u2193\n.\n\n(37)\n\nIncluding corrections to the spin operator via the unitary transformation, discussed earlier for the static structure factor, leads to two modifications in the dynamical response. The first is a simple modification of the\nspin operator by a multiplicative \"form factor\" S + (q) \u2192\nG(q)S + (q), with\nG(q) = 1 \u2212\n\n2t2\n(2 \u2212 cos qx \u2212 cos qy )\nU2\n\n(38)\n\nThis will not affect the magnon energies but will correct the dynamical response by an overall multiplicative\nprefactor G2 (q).\nThe second effect of this unitary tranformation as discussed is to generate a new term which causes a transition\nfrom the lower to the upper Hubbard band. This term\nplays a role only if we examine spin dynamics at very\nhigh energies, and is of no relevance at energies probed\nin the neutron scattering experiments to which we restrict attention here. We see that at a given momentum\nq, if one of the two spinons combining to give the spin\noperator in Eq. (37) is condensed (which would happen\nfor spinon momenta \u00b1(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) in the N\u00e9el state), that\npart behaves as a single particle excitation with a well defined dispersion - this is the magnon. For general k, both\nspinons are uncondensed and this remainder of the sum\ncontributes to the scattering continuum. Quite generally, both parts play a role when we evaluate the spectral\nfunction for the S + (q) operator.\nA.\n\nMagnon dispersion\n\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that the magnon\nenergy at momentum q within the mean field theory\n\n\f6\n\n450\n\na similar dip near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) by generating an antiferromagnetic exchange of order t23 /U , electronic structure\ncalculations for La2 CuO4 indicate that such hopping matrix elements are too small to be relevant.\n\nSchwinger boson MFT\n\nMagnon energy (meV)\n\n400\n350\n300\n\nB.\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2)\n\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c0,0)\n\n(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2)\n\n(0,0)\n\n(\u03c0,0)\n\nFIG. 3: Fit of the magnon dispersion obtained from Schwinger\nboson mean field theory to the experimental data at T =\n10K in Ref. 2 along the standard contour in the Brillouin\nzone. The Hubbard model parameters used for this fit are t =\n360meV and U = 2.34eV , with the effective spin Hamiltonian\ncouplings given by Eq. (6).\n\nof the N\u00e9el state is just given by \u03a9Q\u2212q /2 where Q =\n\u00b1(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). For our choice of mean field decoupling,\nand for spin S \u2192 \u221e, this is exactly half the value given\nby spin-wave theory21 . It is known22 that Schwinger boson mean field theory for the Heisenberg model has this\nshortcoming, which can be fixed by working within a\nlarge-N generalization of the Schwinger boson theory and\nincluding 1/N corrections to the mean field (N = \u221e) result. Since we reduce our original Hamiltonian in Eq. (2)\nto an effective Heisenberg-type model before we use the\nSchwinger boson representation, we expect the same fluctuation corrections to appear in our case as well, however\nan explicit calculation is beyond the scope of this paper.\nHere and below we will work with \u03a9k as the magnon energy. Note that the O(t/U )2 corrections to the spin operator do not affect the magnon dispersion. Fig. 3 shows\nthe magnon energy \u03a9k obtained within the mean field\ntheory for U/t = 6.5 and t = 360meV compared with\nthe experimental data from Coldea et al. This choice of\nparameters gives a good fit to the dispersion over the\nentire contour along the Brillouin zone, including both\nthe linearly dispersing spin-wave regime as well as the\nhigh energy magnon dispersion along the zone boundary.\nWhile the fit along the zone boundary is easy to see in the\nfigure, its accuracy at low energies may be seen from the\nspin wave velocity in the mean field theory c \u2248 800meV \u00c5 being in good agreement with experiment. We also\npoint out that at much larger values of U/t (>\n\u223c 7), we are\nunable to reproduce properly the dip in the magnon dispersion at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) while traversing the zone boundary.\nWhile further neighbor hoppings in the Hubbard model\n(e.g. third-nearest neighbor hopping t3 ) could produce\n\nScattering continuum\n\nHaving fixed the parameter values U, t from fitting the\nmagnon dispersion to the data, we next turn to the scattering continuum. Specifically, we are interested in asking how much weight is present in the continuum relative\nto the magnon, and if there are any features in the continuum which may be experimentally observable. Recall\nthat in the mean field theory this part of the spectrum\nis just the two-spinon excitation continuum. In order to\nobtain the weight in the continuum versus the magnon,\nwe consider the energy integrated response. This is just\nthe structure factor\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u0014\u0012 |\u03b2k\u2212q \u2212 \u03bb|\n|\u03b2k \u2212 \u03bb|\nS(q) =\n\u22121\n+1\n\u03a9k\u2212q\n\u03a9k\nk\n\u0015\n\u03b1\u2217k \u03b1k\u2212q\n(39)\n\u2212\n\u03a9k \u03a9k\u2212q\nTo obtain the magnon weight part, we need to keep only\nthose contributions where \u03a9k or \u03a9k\u2212q would vanish in\nthe thermodynamic limit (or are minimum on a finite\nbut large lattice). The continuum contribution is the remaining part of the sum. Fig. 4 shows the ratio of these\nweights along the same contour in the Brillouin zone over\nwhich the magnon dispersion is displayed. This ratio is\nclearly insensitive to the \"form factor\" G(q), however the\nimportant thing to note from the plot is that the continuum weight is most significant along the zone boundary\nand accounts for nearly 40% of the total spectral weight.\nThis is the most promising region to study the continuum in neutron scattering experiments. The continuum\nweight is also considerable along the line from (\u03c0, 0) to\n(\u03c0, \u03c0/2). This is qualitatively similar to results inferred\nfor the Heisenberg model from QMC calculations15 . In\norder to display possible interesting features in the continuum scattering we have plotted the spectrum of excitations at a few q points along the zone boundary in\nFig. 6, as well a grayscale plot of the spectral function\nin Fig. 5 along (0, 0) \u2192 (\u03c0, \u03c0) and along (\u03c0, 0) \u2192 (0, \u03c0).\nWe see that in addition to the magnon, there are singular secondary features in the spectrum. These secondary peaks can be shown to arise from special points\n{K} in the Brillouin zone in the vicinity of which the\nsum \u03a9k + \u03a9k\u2212q varies slowly (dispersing as \u223c |k \u2212 K|4 )\ngiving rise to a log singular density of states for the twospinon continuum. These secondary peaks and continuum scattering also arise within the mean field theory\nfor the nearest neighbor Heisenberg model, with minor\nquantitative changes due to differences in the spinon dispersion.

Such multispin interactions and their effects are potentially important in any\ncorrelated insulator with local charge fluctuations. For\nLa2 CuO4 , the experimental magnon dispersion is well re-\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nE/J\n1\n\nFIG. 6: The dynamical structure factor along the zone boundary at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) (top), (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4) (middle) and (\u03c0, 0) (bottom), showing the sharp magnon (as a bold vertical line not\ndrawn to scale) and the broad continuum including the sharp\nsecondary features most clearly visible at (\u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/4).\n\nproduced by our approach with Hubbard model parameters U \u2248 2.34eV , and t \u2248 360meV . These values are consistent with the experimental estimates9 , and electronic\nstructure calculations10 . This leads to a sizeable value of\nthe four-spin exchange term J\u2737 \u2248 0.55J1 in the effective\nspin Hamiltonian. Good agreement with experiments is\nalso obtained for spin wave velocity and spin stiffness,\nthus leading to a consistent description of the magnetic\nbehavior of this Mott insulator. The staggered moment\nis substantially reduced from that for the Heisenberg\nmodel, it would be worth revisiting experiments to test\nfor this reduced ordered moment. We have also discussed\n\n\f8\ndifferences in sum rules between Hubbard and Heisenberg\nmodels, and refer the reader to more recent work8 for additional insights, alternative approaches, and the current\nexperimental status. Beyond the single magnon excitation, we have shown that there is considerable spectral\nweight in the continuum along the zone boundary, and\nthat the dynamical structure factor exhibits secondary\npeaks which we understand as arising from the density\nof states of two-spinon excitations. These could be explored in experiments with high intensity neutron sources\nin the near future.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nD.J. Thouless, Proc. Phys. Soc.

For the mean field decoupling scheme used in this\nbook and in some earlier papers, the mean field theory gets\nthe static structure factor and the correction to the classical ground state energy incorrect by a factor of 3/2 and 2\nrespectively. By contrast, our mean field decoupling gives\naccurate ground state properties (structure factor and energy) but a factor-of-two difference appears in the magnon\ndispersion.\n\n\f"}
