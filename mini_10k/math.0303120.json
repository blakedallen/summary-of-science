Square complex, CAT (0), free group, Tits metric, geodesic.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe study groups acting isometrically and cellularly on CAT (0) square complexes.\nA CAT (0) square complex is a simply connected 2-complex such that each 2-cell is\nisometric to the unit square in the Euclidean plane and all simple loops in the vertex\nlinks contain at least four edges. A CAT (0) square complex with the induced path\nmetric is a CAT (0) space.\nLet G be a group acting properly and cocompactly on a CAT (0) square complex\nby cellular isometries. By a result of G. Niblo-L. Reeves ([NR]), G does not have\nKazhdan's property (T). Besides this result, not much restriction is known about the\nproperties of G. G can be an incoherent group (for instance F2 \u00d7 F2 , [S], [Bi]), a\nnonresidually finite group ([W]) or even a torsion-free simple group ([BM]). In this\npaper we are mainly interested in the structure of subgroups of G. Specifically we\nwould like to know whether a subgroup contains a free group of rank two if it is not\nvirtually free abelian.\nThe same question can be asked for any group G acting properly and cocompactly on a CAT (0) space X. It has been answered affirmatively for the following\n1\n\n\f2\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nspaces: trees ([PV]) or more generally Gromov hyperbolic spaces ([G]); certain cubical\ncomplexes ([BSw]); Euclidean buildings of rank \u2265 3 or symmetric spaces ([T]); spaces\nwith isolated flats ([HR]); Hadamard 3-manifolds and certain real analytic Hadamard\n4-manifolds ([X1]). The question in the general case appears hard. In particular it is\nstill open for Hadamard 4-manifolds and CAT (0) 2-complexes. It is not even known\n([Sw]) whether G has an infinite subgroup where each element is of finite order. S.\nAdams and W. Ballmann ([AB]) showed any amenable subgroup of the group G is\nvirtually free abelian. When X is a piecewise smooth 2-complex where each edge is\ncontained in at least two 2-cells, W. Ballmann and M. Brin ([BBr]) showed either G\ncontains a free group of rank two or X is isometric to the Euclidean plane.\nBelow we describe the results in this paper. A square complex is a quarter plane\nif it is isomorphic to the first quadrant {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0} with the obvious\nsquare complex structure. The point corresponding to the origin is called the cone\npoint of the quarter plane. A square complex homeomorphic to the plane is a fake\nplane if it is the union of five quarter planes having the same cone point and disjoint\ninteriors. The main result of this paper can be stated as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let G be a group acting properly and cocompactly on a CAT (0) square\ncomplex X by cellular isometries. If there is no fake plane in X, then any subgroup\nH of G either is virtually free abelian or contains a free group of rank two.\nIn general it is not easy to check whether a CAT (0) square complex contains a\nfake plane. But if a CAT (0) square complex contains a fake plane, then some vertex\nlink (at the cone point) must contain a simple loop with 5 edges. Notice there are\nonly a finite number of vertex links modulo G and each vertex link is a finite graph.\nCorollary 1.2. Let G be a group acting properly and cocompactly on a CAT (0)\nsquare complex X by cellular isometries. If no vertex link of X contains simple loops\nconsisting of five edges, then any subgroup of G either is virtually free abelian or\ncontains a free group of rank two.\nIf each simple loop in the vertex links of X consists of an even number of edges\nCorollary 1.2 also follows from W. Ballmann and J. Swiatkowski's result ([BSw]) on\nfoldable cubical complexes. Recall for any odd integer m \u2265 5, there are CAT (0)\nsquare complexes admitting proper and cocompact cellular isometric actions such\nthat vertex links contain simple loops consisting of m edges: ([Be], [BH], [BBr2])\ngiven any finite connected graph L where simple loops contain at least 4 edges, there\nexists a CAT (0) square complex admitting a proper and cocompact cellular isometric\naction such that all vertex links are isomorphic to L.\nFor any CAT (0) space X, dT denotes the Tits metric on the ideal boundary \u2202\u221e X.\nFor each geodesic c : R \u2192 X, the positive and negative directions of c give rise to two\npoints in the ideal boundary, called the endpoints of the geodesic (see Section 2.2).\nWhen g is a hyperbolic isometry of a CAT (0) space, we denote the endpoints of the\naxes of g by g(+\u221e) and g(\u2212\u221e).\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n3\n\nIn order to prove Theorem 1.1, we need to decide when a subgroup of G contains\na free group of rank two. By W. Ballmann's theorem (see Section 3.1 or [B]), if a\nsubgroup H < G contains a rank one isometry then H either is virtually infinite\ncyclic or contains a free group of rank two. K. Ruane ([R]) showed if g, h are two\nhyperbolic isometries and if dT (\u03be, \u03b7) > \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {g(+\u221e), g(\u2212\u221e)} and any\n\u03b7 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}, then the group generated by g and h contains a free group\nof rank two. Notice if \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202\u221e X with dT (\u03be, \u03b7) > \u03c0, then there is a geodesic in\nX with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints. Thus the following result should be considered as a\ngeneralization of K. Ruane's theorem in the case of square complexes.\nTheorem 3.7. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) square complex. Suppose g and h\nare two hyperbolic isometries of X such that for any \u03be \u2208 {g(+\u221e), g(\u2212\u221e)} and any\n\u03b7 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}, there is a geodesic in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints. Then the\ngroup generated by g and h contains a free group of rank two.\nR. Alperin, B. Farb and G. Noskov ([AFN]) provided sufficient conditions for two\nhyperbolic isometries to generate a free group of rank two. Let g, h be two hyperbolic\nisometries of a CAT (0) space X and ag , ah their axes. In the case the two axes are\ndisjoint and if p \u2208 ag , q \u2208 ah realize the distance between the axes, their condition\nrequires the four angles that the geodesic segment pq makes with the axes to be \u03c0.\nA similar idea was also used by W. Ballmann and M. Brin in an earlier paper [BBr].\nTheir conditions are too stringent for our purposes. Our condition is weaker and\nmore applicable, but only in the square complex case. It is an open question whether\nTheorem 3.7 holds for all CAT (0) spaces.\nTo apply Theorem 3.7 we need to know when two points \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202\u221e X are the\nendpoints of a geodesic in X. Recall a necessary condition is dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2265 \u03c0, and a\nsufficient condition is dT (\u03be, \u03b7) > \u03c0. We provide a criterion for \u03be and \u03b7 to be the\nendpoints of a geodesic in X when dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0 and X is a CAT (0) 2-complex.\nA point in the ideal boundary of a CAT (0) space is called a terminal point if it\ndoes not lie in the interior of any Tits geodesic.\nTheorem 4.9. Let X be a CAT (0) 2-complex that admits a proper, cocompact action\nby cellular isometries. If \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202\u221e X are not terminal points and dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2265 \u03c0, then\nthere is a geodesic in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints.\nThe conclusion of Theorem 4.9 does not hold if X is not a CAT (0) 2-complex. For\ninstance, the universal covers of nonpositively curved 3-dimensional graph manifolds\n([BS], [CK]) are counterexamples.\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 1.1, we need to find two hyperbolic isometries\ng, h of the subgroup H such that dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2265 \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {g(+\u221e), g(\u2212\u221e)} and\nany \u03b7 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}. This is done with the help of the following result, whose\nproof is essentially due to W. Ballmann and S. Buyalo ([BB]). Recall for any group\nH acting isometrically on a CAT (0) space X, the limit set \u039b(H) \u2282 \u2202\u221e X (see Section\n\n\f4\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\n2.5 for definition) is closed and invariant under H. A minimal set is a closed and Hinvariant subset of \u039b(H) that does not properly contain any closed and H-invariant\nsubset of \u039b(H). Minimal set always exists when the CAT (0) space is locally compact.\nTheorem 2.7.([X1]) Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) space and H a group acting\non X by isometries. If H does not contain any rank one isometry, then for any\nminimal set M we have dT (m, \u03be) \u2264 \u03c0 for any m \u2208 M and any \u03be \u2208 \u039b(H).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall basic facts about CAT (0)\nsquare complexes and collect results that shall be needed later on. The topics covered\nin this section include: CAT (0) 2-complexes, Tits boundary, action of a hyperbolic\nisometry on the ideal boundary, convex subgroups and minimal set. In Section 3 we\nprove Theorem 3.7. In Section 4 we recall results from [X2] about Tits boundary of\nCAT (0) 2-complexes and prove Theorem 4.9. In Section 5 we use support sets to\nshow a CAT (0) square complex contains a fake plane if and only if the Tits boundary\ncontains a simple loop with length 2.5\u03c0. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is completed in\nSections 6 and 7.\nAcknowledgment. I would like to thank Bruce Kleiner, Quo-Shin Chi and Blake\nThornton for helpful discussions and suggestions.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we first recall basic definitions concerning CAT (0) spaces and then\nrecord some results that shall be needed later on. The reader is referred to [B], [BH],\n[R], [Sw] and [X1] for more details on the material in this section.\n2.1\n\nCAT (0) Square Complexes\n\nLet Z be an arbitrary metric space. For any subset A \u2282 Z and any \u01eb > 0, the\n\u01eb-neighborhood of A is N\u01eb (A) = {z \u2208 Z : d(z, a) \u2264 \u01eb for some a \u2208 A}. For any z \u2208 Z\nand any r > 0, B(z, r) = {z \u2032 \u2208 Z : d(z, z \u2032 ) \u2264 r} is the closed metric ball with center\nz and radius r. For a group G of isometries of Z, the action of G on Z is proper if\nfor any compact set K \u2282 Z, the set {g \u2208 G : g(K) \u2229 K 6= \u03c6} is finite.\nA minimal geodesic in Z is an isometric embedding c : I \u2192 Z where I \u2282 R\nis an interval in the real line R. A geodesic in Z is a locally isometric embedding\nc : I \u2192 Z, that is, each point t \u2208 I has a neighborhood U in I such that c|U is a\nminimal geodesic. If c : [a, b] \u2192 Z is a geodesic, then we say c is a geodesic segment\nfrom c(a) to c(b); sometimes we also say c connects the two points c(a) and c(b). We\nalso abuse language and call the image of a geodesic a geodesic.\nThe Euclidean cone over Z is the metric space C(Z) defined as follows. As a set\nC(Z) = Z \u00d7[0, \u221e)/Z \u00d7 {0}. The image\np of (z, t) is denoted by tz. d(t1 z1 , t2 z2 ) = t1 +t2\nif d(z1 , z2 ) \u2265 \u03c0, and d(t1 z1 , t2 z2 ) = t21 + t22 \u2212 2t1 t2 cos(d(z1 , z2 )) if d(z1 , z2 ) \u2264 \u03c0. The\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n5\n\nEuclidean cone Cr (Z) over Z with radius r > 0 is the metric ball B(O, r) \u2282 C(Z)\nwhere O = Z \u00d7 {0} is the cone point of C(Z).\nA 2-dimensional CW -complex is called a polygonal complex if\n(1) all the attaching maps are homeomorphisms;\n(2) the intersection of any two closed cells is either empty or exactly one closed cell.\nA 0-cell is also called a vertex. A closed 2-cell whose boundary contains n vertices\nis called a n-gon.\nA polygonal complex is piecewise Euclidean if there is a metric on each closed cell\nsuch that\n(1) each closed cell is isometric to a closed convex subset of the Euclidean plane;\n(2) if A, B are two closed cells with A \u2282 B, then the inclusion of A into B is an\nisometric embedding.\nIt follows that a n-gon in a piecewise Euclidean polygonal complex X is isometric\nto a convex Euclidean n-gon, although the interior angles at some vertices could be\n\u03c0. We assume there are only a finite number of isometry types for the closed cells of\nX and always equip X with the induced path metric. It follows from [BH] that X is\na complete metric space.\nLet X be a locally finite piecewise Euclidean polygonal complex and x \u2208 X. The\nlink Link(X, x) is a metric graph defined as follows. Let A be a closed 2-cell containing\nx. The unit tangent space Sx A of A at x is isometric to the unit circle with length\n2\u03c0. We first define a subset Link(A, x) of Sx A. For any v \u2208 Sx A, v \u2208 Link(A, x) if\nand only if the initial segment of the geodesic with initial point x and initial direction\nv lies in A. Thus Link(A, x) = Sx A if x lies in the interior of A; Link(A, x) is a\nclosed semicircle (with length \u03c0) if x lies in the interior of a 1-cell contained in A;\nand Link(A, x) is a closed segment with length \u03b1 if x is a vertex of A and the interior\nangle of A at x is \u03b1. Similarly if x is contained in a closed 1-cell B we can define\nSx B and Link(B, x) \u2282 Sx B. We note Sx B consists of two points at distance \u03c0 apart,\nLink(B, x) = Sx B if x lies in the interior of B and Link(B, x) consists of a single\npoint if x is a vertex of B. When x lies in a closed 1-cell B and B is contained in a\nclosed 2-cell A, Sx B and Link(B, x) can be naturally identified with subsets of Sx A\nand Link(A, x) respectively.\nWe define Link(X, x) = \u222aA Link(A, x), where A varies over all closed 1-cells and\n2-cells containing x. Here Link(B, x) is identified with a subset of Link(A, x) as\nindicated in the last paragraph when x lies in a closed 1-cell B and B is contained in\na closed 2-cell A. We let dx be the induced path metric on Link(X, x).\nSince X is piecewise Euclidean and locally finite, it is not hard to see that for\neach x \u2208 X there is some r > 0 such that B(x, r) \u2282 X is isometric to the Euclidean\ncone Cr (Link(X, x)) over Link(X, x) with radius r.\nWe say X is nonpositively curved if for each vertex v \u2208 X, Link(X, v) contains no\nsimple loop with length strictly less than 2\u03c0. A CAT (0) 2-complex in this paper shall\nalways mean a simply connected, nonpositively curved and locally finite piecewise\n\n\f6\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nEuclidean polygonal complex.\nA CAT (0) square complex is a CAT (0) 2-complex such that each closed 2-cell\nis isometric to the square in the Euclidean plane with edge length 1. Let X be a\nCAT (0) square complex. Then for each vertex v \u2208 X, each edge in Link(X, v) has\nlength \u03c0/2. Thus each simple loop in Link(X, v) contains at least 4 edges.\nCAT (0) 2-complexes are examples of CAT (0) spaces (see for example [BH]). Let\nX be a CAT (0) space. One key feature of a CAT (0) space is the convexity of distance\nfunction: if c1 : I1 \u2192 X, c2 : I2 \u2192 X are geodesics, then d(c1 (t1 ), c2 (t2 )) is a convex\nfunction defined on I1 \u00d7 I2 . It follows that all geodesics in X are minimal geodesics,\nand there is exactly one geodesic segment connecting two given points in X. For any\nx, y \u2208 X, xy shall denote the unique geodesic segment connecting x and y.\nLet X be a CAT (0) space. For any three points x, y, z \u2208 X with y, z 6= x, let\nx\u2032 , y \u2032, z \u2032 \u2208 E2 be three points on the Euclidean plane such that d(x, y) = d(x\u2032 , y \u2032),\n \u0303 x (y, z) = \u2220x\u2032 (y \u2032 , z \u2032 ), the angle between\nd(y, z) = d(y \u2032, z \u2032 ) and d(z, x) = d(z \u2032 , x\u2032 ). Set \u2220\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nthe two segments x y and x z in the Euclidean plane. Let c1 and c2 be geodesic\nsegments from x to y and from x to z respectively. The convexity of distance function\n \u0303 x (c1 (t), c2 (t)) is an increasing function of t. Thus we can define the angle at\nimplies \u2220\nx between y and z as follows:\n \u0303 x (c1 (t), c2 (t)).\n\u2220x (y, z) = lim \u2220\nt\u21920\n\nThe angle at x satisfies the triangle inequality: \u2220x (y, z) \u2264 \u2220x (y, w) + \u2220x (w, z) for all\ny, z, w 6= x. And we have \u2220x (y, z) + \u2220y (z, x) + \u2220z (y, x) \u2264 \u03c0 for any three distinct\npoints x, y, z \u2208 X.\nLet X be a CAT (0) 2-complex. For any x, y \u2208 X with x 6= y, the tangent vector of\nxy at x is denoted by logx (y) \u2208 Link(X, x). Notice for any x, y, z \u2208 X with y, z 6= x,\nwe have \u2220x (y, z) = min{\u03c0, dx (logx (y), logx (z))}.\nLet X be a CAT (0) space. A subset A \u2282 X is a convex subset if xy \u2282 A for\nany x, y \u2208 A. Let A \u2282 X be a closed convex subset. The orthogonal projection\nonto A, \u03c0A : X \u2192 A can be defined as follows: for any x \u2208 X the inequality\nd(x, \u03c0A (x)) \u2264 d(x, a) holds for all a \u2208 A. It follows that for any x \u2208\n/ A and any\na 6= \u03c0A (x) we have \u2220\u03c0A (x) (x, a) \u2265 \u03c0/2.\n2.2\n\nIdeal Boundary of a CAT (0) Space\n\nLet X be a CAT(0) space, for example a CAT (0) 2-complex. A ray starting from\np \u2208 X is a geodesic \u03b1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X with \u03b1(0) = p. Two rays \u03b11 and \u03b12 are asymptotic\nif d(\u03b11 (t), \u03b12 (t)) is a bounded function on the interval [0, \u221e). The ideal boundary of\nX is the set \u2202X of asymptotic classes of rays in X. Set X = X \u222a \u2202X. For any\np \u2208 X and any \u03be \u2208 \u2202X, there is a unique ray \u03b3p\u03be : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X that starts from p\nand belongs to \u03be (the image of \u03b3p\u03be is denoted by p\u03be). Thus for any p \u2208 X we can\nidentify \u2202X with the set of rays starting from p. Fix p \u2208 X. Let \u03b1, \u03b1i (i = 1, 2, * * * )\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n7\n\nbe rays starting from p. We say {\u03b1i }\u221e\ni=1 converges to \u03b1 if \u03b1i converges to \u03b1 uniformly\non compact subsets of [0, \u221e). Similarly for xi \u2208 X (i = 1, 2, * * * ) we say {xi }\u221e\ni=1\nconverges to \u03be \u2208 X if pxi converges to the geodesic segment or ray p\u03be uniformly on\ncompact subsets. In this way we define a topology on X. It is easy to check that this\ntopology is independent of the point p \u2208 X and the induced topology on X coincides\nwith the original metric topology on X. Both this topology and the induced topology\non \u2202X are called the cone topology. \u2202X together with the cone topology is called the\ngeometric boundary of X, and denoted by \u2202\u221e X.\nLet p \u2208 X and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202X, it follows from the convexity of distance function that\n \u0303\n\u2220p (\u03b3p\u03be (t), \u03b3p\u03b7 (t)) is an increasing function of t and therefore the following limit exists:\n \u0303 p (\u03b3p\u03be (t), \u03b3p\u03b7 (t)). This limit is independent of the point p and defined to be\nlimt\u2192\u221e \u2220\nthe Tits angle \u2220T (\u03be, \u03b7) between \u03be and \u03b7. The Tits metric dT on \u2202X is the path\nmetric induced by \u2220T . Notice dT takes value in [0, \u221e) \u222a {+\u221e}. In particular, by\nProposition 2.1 (iv) below, dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u221e if and only if \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202X are in different path\ncomponents with respect to \u2220T . \u2202X equipped with the Tits metric dT is denoted by\n\u2202T X. The Tits topology and the cone topology are generally quite different.\nBelow we collect some basic facts concerning the Tits metric. For more details\nplease see [BGS] and [BH]. For any geodesic c : R \u2192 X in a CAT (0) space, we call\nthe two points in \u2202\u221e X determined by the two rays c|[0,+\u221e) and c|(\u2212\u221e,0] the endpoints\nof c, and denote them by c(+\u221e) and c(\u2212\u221e) respectively.\nProposition 2.1. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) space, \u2202T X its Tits boundary,\nand \u03be, \u03b7, \u03bei , \u03b7i \u2208 \u2202T X (i = 1, 2, * * * ).\n(i) \u2202T X is a CAT(1) space; in particular, there is no geodesic loop in \u2202T X with length\nstrictly less than 2\u03c0;\n(ii) If dT (\u03be, \u03b7) > \u03c0, then there is a geodesic in X with \u03be, \u03b7 as endpoints;\n(iii) If \u03bei \u2192 \u03be and \u03b7i \u2192 \u03b7 in the cone topology, then dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2264 lim inf i\u2192\u221e dT (\u03bei , \u03b7i );\n(iv) If dT (\u03be, \u03b7) < \u221e, then there is a minimal geodesic in \u2202T X from \u03be to \u03b7;\n(v) If dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03c0, then dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u2220T (\u03be, \u03b7).\n2.3\n\nDynamics of Hyperbolic Isometries\n\nLet X be a CAT (0) space and g : X \u2192 X an isometry of X. g is called a hyperbolic\nisometry if it translates a geodesic, that is, if there is a geodesic c : R \u2192 X and a\npositive number l so that g(c(t)) = c(t+l) for all t \u2208 R; the geodesic c is called an axis\nof g. All the axes of g are parallel, thus it makes sense to denote g(+\u221e) = c(+\u221e),\ng(\u2212\u221e) = c(\u2212\u221e). Recall two geodesics c1 , c2 : R \u2192 X are parallel if d(c1 (t), c2 (t)) is\na bounded function over R.\nFor a hyperbolic isometry g, let Min(g) be the union of all the axes of g and Pg\nthe union of all the geodesics parallel to the axes of g. We call Pg the parallel set of\ng. Then Min(g) \u2282 Pg . Both Min(g) and Pg are closed convex subsets in X and split\nisometrically as follows: Min(g) = Y \u00d7 R \u2282 Y0 \u00d7 R = Pg , where Y \u2282 Y0 is a closed\nconvex subset of Y0 , each {y} \u00d7 R, y \u2208 Y is an axis of g and each {y0 } \u00d7 R, y0 \u2208 Y0\n\n\f8\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nis parallel to the axes of g. The geometric boundaries \u2202\u221e Min(g) and \u2202\u221e Pg naturally\nembed into \u2202\u221e X.\nRecall each isometry g of X induces a homeomorphism (with respect to the cone\ntopology) of X, which we still denote by g.\nTheorem 2.2. (V. Schroeder [BGS], K. Ruane [R]) Let X be a locally compact\nCAT (0) space and g a hyperbolic isometry of X. Then:\n(i) The fixed point set of g in \u2202\u221e X is \u2202\u221e Min(g);\n(ii) If \u03be \u2208 \u2202\u221e X \u2212 \u2202\u221e Pg and \u03b7 is an accumulation point of the set {g i (\u03be) : i \u2265 1},\nthen \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202\u221e Pg and \u2220T (\u03b7, g(\u2212\u221e)) = \u2220T (\u03be, g(\u2212\u221e)).\n2.4\n\nConvex Subgroups\n\nThe following definition is due to E. Swenson ([Sw]).\nDefinition 2.3. Let X be a CAT (0) space and G a group acting properly and\ncocompactly by isometries on X. A subgroup H < G is a convex subgroup if there\nis a closed convex subset Y \u2282 X such that h(Y ) = Y for any h \u2208 H and Y /H is\ncompact.\nTheorem 2.4. (E. Swenson [Sw]) Let X be a CAT (0) space and G a group acting properly and cocompactly by isometries on X. Suppose H, K \u2282 G are convex\nsubgroups with A, B \u2282 X the corresponding closed convex subsets. Then H \u2229 K is a\nconvex subgroup. Furthermore, for any \u01eb > 0 with N\u01eb (A) \u2229 N\u01eb (B) 6= \u03c6, N\u01eb (A) \u2229 N\u01eb (B)\nis a closed convex subset corresponding to H \u2229 K.\nRecall for any group G and any g \u2208 G, the centralizer of g in G is defined as\nfollows: Cg (G) = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : \u03b3g = g\u03b3}.\nTheorem 2.5. (K. Ruane [R]) Let X be a CAT (0) space, G a group acting properly\nand cocompactly by isometries on X and g \u2208 G a hyperbolic isometry. Then Cg (G)\nis a convex subgroup with Min(g) the corresponding closed convex subset.\n2.5\n\nAction on the Limit Set\n\nLet X be a CAT (0) space and H a group acting on X by isometries. A point\n\u03be \u2208 \u2202\u221e X is a limit point of H if there is a sequence of elements {hi }\u221e\ni=1 \u2282 H such\nthat hi (x) \u2192 \u03be for some (hence any) x \u2208 X. The limit set \u039b(H) \u2282 \u2202\u221e X of H is the\nset of limit points of H. It is easy to check that \u039b(H) is closed (in the cone topology)\nand H-invariant.\nDefinition 2.6. A nonempty closed and H-invariant subset M \u2282 \u039b(H) is minimal\nif it does not contain any proper subset that is nonempty, closed and H-invariant.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n9\n\nWhen the CAT (0) space X is locally compact, the geometric boundary \u2202\u221e X and\nall its closed subsets are compact. It follows from Zorn's lemma that minimal set\nalways exists when X is locally compact.\nThe proof of the following result is essentially due to Ballmann and Buyalo ([BB]),\nwho assumed \u039b(H) = \u2202\u221e X. See Section 3.1 for the definition of a rank one isometry.\nTheorem 2.7. ([X1]) Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) space and H a group acting\non X by isometries. If H does not contain any rank one isometry, then dT (m, \u03be) \u2264 \u03c0\nfor any minimal set M and any m \u2208 M, \u03be \u2208 \u039b(H).\n\n3\n\nFree Subgroups\n\nThe goal of this section is to establish a criterion (Theorem 3.7) for the existence of\nfree subgroups in a group acting isometrically on a CAT (0) square complex.\n3.1\n\nRank One Isometries\n\nLet X be a CAT (0) space. A flat half-plane in X is the image of an isometric\nembedding f : {(x, y) \u2208 E2 : y \u2265 0} \u2192 X, and in this case we say the geodesic\nc : R \u2192 X, c(t) = f (t, 0) bounds the flat half-plane.\nDefinition 3.1. A hyperbolic isometry g of a CAT (0) space X is called a rank one\nisometry if no axis of g bounds a flat half-plane in X.\nTheorem 3.2. (W. Ballmann [B]) Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) space and g\na rank one isometry of X. Given any neighborhoods U of g(+\u221e) and V of g(\u2212\u221e)\nin X, there is an n \u2265 0 such that g k (X \u2212 V ) \u2282 U and g \u2212k (X \u2212 U) \u2282 V whenever\nk \u2265 n.\nTheorem 3.2 implies g(+\u221e) and g(\u2212\u221e) are the only fixed points of a rank one\nisometry g in X. The theorem also has the following two corollaries.\nCorollary 3.3. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) space, G a group of isometries\nof X and g \u2208 G a rank one isometry. Then one of the following holds:\n(i) G has a fixed point in \u2202\u221e X;\n(ii) Some axis c of g is G-invariant;\n(iii) G contains a free group of rank two.\nCorollary 3.4. Let G be a group acting properly and cocompactly by isometries on a\nCAT (0) space, and H a subgroup of G. If H contains a rank one isometry, then H\neither is virtually infinite cyclic or contains a free group of rank two.\n\n\f10\n3.2\n\nXiangdong Xie\nPing-Pong Lemma\n\nFor any group G and any g1 , g2 \u2208 G, < g1 , g2 > denotes the group generated by g1\nand g2 . We recall the following well-known lemma.\nLemma 3.5. Let G be a group acting on a set X, and g1 , g2 two elements of G. If\nX1 , X2 are disjoint subsets of X and for all n 6= 0, i 6= j, gin (Xj ) \u2282 Xi , then the\nsubgroup < g1 , g2 > is free of rank two.\nWe will apply the Ping-Pong Lemma in the following setting. Let X be a CAT (0)\nspace and g1 , g2 two hyperbolic isometries of X. Then there are geodesics c1 : R \u2192 X,\nc2 : R \u2192 X and numbers a, b > 0 with g1 (c1 (t)) = c1 (t + a) and g2 (c2 (t)) = c2 (t + b)\nfor all t \u2208 R. Let \u03c01 : X \u2192 c1 (R) and \u03c02 : X \u2192 c2 (R) be orthogonal projections\nonto the geodesics c1 and c2 respectively. Set X1 = \u03c01\u22121 (c1 ((\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [a, \u221e))) and\nX2 = \u03c02\u22121 (c2 ((\u2212\u221e, 0] \u222a [b, \u221e))). The following lemma is clear.\nLemma 3.6. Let X, g1 , g2 , X1 and X2 be as above. If X1 \u2229 X2 = \u03c6, then the\nconditions in the Ping-Pong Lemma are satisfied. In particular, < g1 , g2 > is free of\nrank two.\n3.3\n\nFree Subgroup Criterion\n\nThe following is the main result of Section 3.\nTheorem 3.7. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) square complex. Suppose g1 and\ng2 are two hyperbolic isometries of X such that for any \u03be \u2208 {g1 (+\u221e), g1(\u2212\u221e)} and\nany \u03b7 \u2208 {g2 (+\u221e), g2(\u2212\u221e)}, there is a geodesic in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints. Then\n< g1 , g2 > contains a free group of rank two.\nLet c : I \u2192 X be a geodesic defined on an interval I. Then for any p in the interior\nof c(I), the dp distance between the two directions of c at p is at least \u03c0. Recall dp is\na path metric defined on the link Link(X, p), and in general the two directions of c\nat p may have dp distance larger than \u03c0.\nDefinition 3.8. A geodesic c : I \u2192 X is an R-geodesic if for each point p in the\ninterior of c(I), the dp distance between the two directions of c at p is \u03c0.\nLemma 3.9. With the assumptions of Theorem 3.7. If at least one of g1 , g2 has an\naxis that is not an R-geodesic, then < g1 , g2 > contains a free group of rank two.\nProof. Notice if a geodesic bounds a flat half-plane then it is an R-geodesic. The\nassumption in the lemma implies at least one of g1 , g2 is a rank one isometry. Now\nthe lemma follows from Corollary 3.3.\n\nIn light of Lemma 3.9, we will assume the axes of g1 and g2 are R-geodesics.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n11\n\nLemma 3.10. Given any two R-geodesic rays c1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X, c2 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X,\nthere is a number a > 0 with the following property: if qi (i = 1, 2) is a point in the\ninterior of ci , and p \u2208 X, p 6= q1 , q2 such that\n(i) pq1 \u2229 pq2 = {p};\n(ii) pq1 and pq2 are R-geodesics;\n(iii) for each i = 1, 2, at least one of the angles \u2220qi (p, ci (0)), \u2220qi (p, ci (\u221e)) is \u03c0/2;\nthen \u2220p (q1 , q2 ) \u2265 a.\nProof. We first notice that for each R-geodesic c, there is a number \u03b1, 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0/4\nwith the following property: if x, y \u2208 c with x 6= y and xy lies in some square\nS of X, then dx (logx (y), \u03be) takes value in {\u03b1, \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03c0/2 + \u03b1, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1} for any \u03be in\nLink(X, x) that is parallel to one of the edges of S. Let \u03b1i (i = 1, 2) be such a number\ncorresponding to ci . Since pqi is also an R-geodesic and at least one of the angles\n\u2220qi (p, ci (0)), \u2220qi (p, ci (\u221e)) is \u03c0/2, the number \u03b1i also corresponds to pqi . The fact\npq1 \u2229 pq2 = {p} implies \u2220p (q1 , q2 ) 6= 0. Now it is easy to see that \u2220p (q1 , q2 ) \u2265 |\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 |\nwhen \u03b11 6= \u03b12 ; \u2220p (q1 , q2 ) \u2265 min{2\u03b11 , \u03c0/2 \u2212 2\u03b11 } when 0 < \u03b11 = \u03b12 < \u03c0/4; and\n\u2220p (q1 , q2 ) \u2265 \u03c0/2 when \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0 or \u03c0/4.\n\nLemma 3.11. Let \u03be1 , \u03be2 \u2208 \u2202\u221e X and c1 , c2 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X be two rays belonging to \u03be1\nand \u03be2 respectively. Suppose there is a geodesic c in X with \u03be1 and \u03be2 as endpoints.\nThen for i 6= j, \u2220ci (t) (ci (0), cj (t)) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\nProof. Since c is a geodesic in X with \u03be1 and \u03be2 as endpoints, there is a number \u01eb > 0\nsuch that ci \u2282 N\u01eb (c) (i = 1, 2). The convexity of distance function implies for large\nenough t, there is a point pt \u2208 c1 (t)c2 (t) with d(c(0), pt ) \u2264 \u01eb. Now the lemma follows\nby considering the triangle \u2206(ci (t)ci (0)pt ).\n\nLet g1 , g2 be as in Theorem 3.7 and c1 , c2 axes of g1 , g2 respectively. By Lemma\n3.9, we may assume c1 , c2 are R-geodesics. Let \u03c0i : X \u2192 ci (R) (i = 1, 2) be the\northogonal projection onto ci . If there is some T > 0 such that\n\u03c01\u22121 (c1 ((\u2212\u221e, \u2212T ] \u222a [T, \u221e))) \u2229 \u03c02\u22121 (c2 ((\u2212\u221e, \u2212T ] \u222a [T, \u221e))) = \u03c6,\nthen for large enough n, g1n and g2n satisfy the condition in Lemma 3.6 and therefore\ngenerate a free group of rank two. We shall prove there is some T > 0 such that\n\u03c01\u22121 (c1 ([T, \u221e))) \u2229 \u03c02\u22121 (c2 ([T, \u221e))) = \u03c6, the other three cases are similar.\nProposition 3.12. Let \u03be1 , \u03be2 \u2208 \u2202\u221e X and c1 , c2 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X be two rays belonging\nto \u03be1 and \u03be2 respectively. Suppose c1 and c2 are R-geodesics and there is a geodesic\nc in X with \u03be1 and \u03be2 as endpoints. Then \u03c01\u22121 (c1 ([T, \u221e))) \u2229 \u03c02\u22121 (c2 ([T, \u221e))) = \u03c6 for\nlarge enough T > 0, where \u03c0i : X \u2192 ci ([0, \u221e)) is the orthogonal projection onto ci .\n\n\f12\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nProof. Since c1 and c2 are R-geodesics, there is a number a > 0 with the property\nstated in Lemma 3.10. By Lemma 3.11, there is T > 0 with \u2220c1 (t) (c1 (0), c2 (t)) < a/3\nand \u2220c2 (t) (c2 (0), c1(t)) < a/3 for all t \u2265 T .\nSuppose there exists t > T with \u03c01\u22121 (c1 ([t, \u221e))) \u2229 \u03c02\u22121 (c2 ([t, \u221e))) 6= \u03c6. We will\nderive a contradiction from this. Pick p \u2208 \u03c01\u22121 (c1 ([t, \u221e))) \u2229 \u03c02\u22121 (c2 ([t, \u221e))) and set\nqi = \u03c0i (p) (i = 1, 2). Let \u03c32 : [0, b2 ] \u2192 X be the geodesic segment from p to q2 .\nConsider \u03c01|\u03c32 : \u03c32 \u2192 c1 and let t2 = max{t \u2208 [0, b2 ] : \u03c01 (\u03c32 (t)) = q1 }. Then the\ngeodesic q1 \u03c32 (t2 ) is an R-geodesic and at least one of the angles \u2220q1 (c1 (0), \u03c32 (t2 )),\n\u2220q1 (c1 (\u221e), \u03c32 (t2 )) is \u03c0/2. By replacing p with \u03c32 (t2 ), we may assume pq1 is an Rgeodesic and at least one of the angles \u2220q1 (c1 (0), p), \u2220q1 (c1 (\u221e), p) is \u03c0/2. Similarly\nwe may assume pq2 is an R-geodesic and at least one of the angles \u2220q2 (c2 (0), p),\n\u2220q2 (c2 (\u221e), p) is \u03c0/2. In general pq1 and pq2 share an initial segment: pq1 \u2229 pq2 = pp\u2032 .\nBy replacing p with p\u2032 if necessary we may assume pq1 \u2229pq2 = {p}. Now the conditions\nin Lemma 3.10 are satisfied and so \u2220p (q1 , q2 ) \u2265 a.\nConsider the triangle \u2206(pq1 q2 ). Since q1 = \u03c01 (p), \u2220q1 (p, c1 (0)) \u2265 \u03c0/2. It follows\nthat \u2220q1 (p, q2 ) \u2265 \u2220q1 (p, c1 (0)) \u2212 \u2220q1 (q2 , c1 (0)) \u2265 \u03c0/2 \u2212 a/3. Similarly \u2220q2 (p, q1 ) \u2265\n\u03c0/2 \u2212 a/3. Now \u2220q1 (p, q2 ) + \u2220q2 (p, q1 ) + \u2220p (q1 , q2 ) \u2265 2(\u03c0/2 \u2212 a/3) + a > \u03c0, a\ncontradiction.\n\nThe proof of Theorem 3.7 is now complete.\n\n4\n\n\u03c0-Visibility\n\nLet X be a locally compact CAT (0) space and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X. If there is a geodesic in\nX with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints, then dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2265 \u03c0. For the converse, Proposition 2.1\nsays if dT (\u03be, \u03b7) > \u03c0 then there is a geodesic in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints. Our\nmain objective in this section (Theorem 4.9) is to provide a sufficient condition for the\nexistence of a geodesic with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints when X is a CAT (0) 2-complex and\ndT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0. We shall also collect some facts about the Tits boundary of CAT (0)\nsquare complexes.\n4.1\n\nTits Boundary of CAT (0) 2-Complexes\n\nIn this section we recall some facts about the Tits boundary of CAT (0) 2-complexes.\nThe definition of a CAT (0) 2-complex is given in Section 2.1. A sector in the Euclidean plane is a closed convex subset whose boundary is the union of two rays\nstarting from the origin. A flat sector S in a CAT (0) space X is the image of an isometric embedding from a sector in the Euclidean plane into X. The inclusion S \u2282 X\nclearly induces an isometric embedding \u2202T S \u2282 \u2202T X. The following is a theorem from\n[X2] adapted to our setting, which says that away from the endpoints, a segment in\nthe Tits boundary is the ideal boundary of a flat sector.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n13\n\nTheorem 4.1. ([X2]) Let X be a CAT (0) 2-complex that admits a proper, cocompact\naction by cellular isometries. Suppose \u03b3 : [0, h] \u2192 \u2202T X is a geodesic segment in the\nTits boundary of X with length h \u2264 \u03c0. Then for any \u01eb > 0, there exists a flat sector\nS in X with \u2202T S = \u03b3([\u01eb, h \u2212 \u01eb]).\nWe also need the following result concerning rays and flat sectors in a CAT (0)\n2-complex.\nProposition 4.2. ([X2]) Let X be a CAT (0) 2-complex that admits a proper, cocompact action by cellular isometries. Suppose S \u2282 X is a flat sector and c \u2282 X is\na ray. If S \u2229 c = \u03c6 and c represents an interior point of \u2202T S, then there is a ray\nc\u2032 \u2282 S \u2229 X (1) asymptotic to c, where X (1) is the 1-skeleton of X.\nLet B be the set {(x, y) \u2208 E2 : x \u2265 0, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1} with the obvious square complex\nstructure. A flat half-strip in a CAT (0) square complex X is the image of a cellular\nisometric embedding from B into X.\nDefinition 4.3. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex. A point \u03be \u2208 \u2202T X is a singular\npoint if there is a flat half-strip in X such that the rays contained in the flat half-strip\nbelong to \u03be. A point \u03be \u2208 \u2202T X is called a regular point if it is not a singular point but\nlies in the interior of some geodesic segment in \u2202T X.\nLemma 4.4. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex that admits a proper, cocompact\naction by cellular isometries, and \u03c3 \u2282 \u2202T X a geodesic with length strictly greater than\n\u03c0/2. Then there exists a singular point in the interior of \u03c3.\nProof. We may assume \u03c0/2 < length(\u03c3) < \u03c0. By Theorem 4.1 there is a flat sector\nS such that \u2202T S \u2282 \u03c3 has length strictly greater than \u03c0/2. Since S (away from the\nboundary) is tessellated by squares, it is easy to see that there is a singular point in\nthe interior of \u2202T S.\n\nLemma 4.5. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex that admits a proper, cocompact\naction by cellular isometries, and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X with dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03c0/2. Then there is at\nmost one singular point in the interior of \u03be\u03b7.\nProof. Suppose there are two singular points \u03be1 and \u03be2 in the interior of \u03be\u03b7. Theorem\n4.1 implies there exists a flat sector S such that \u03be1 and \u03be2 lie in the interior of \u2202T S and\nlength(\u2202T S) < \u03c0/2. Since \u03be1 and \u03be2 are singular points, there are two flat half-strips\nB1 and B2 and two rays c1 \u2282 B1 , c2 \u2282 B2 asymptotic to \u03be1 and \u03be2 respectively. If\nc1 \u2229 S 6= \u03c6, then a subray of c1 is contained in S and it follows \u03be1 is represented by\na ray contained in S \u2229 X (1) , where X (1) is the 1-skeleton of X. If c1 \u2229 S = \u03c6, then\nProposition 4.2 implies also that \u03be1 is represented by a ray contained in S \u2229 X (1) . So\nin any case \u03be1 is represented by a ray contained in S \u2229X (1) . Similarly \u03be2 is represented\n\n\f14\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nby a ray contained in S \u2229 X (1) . We clearly have a contradiction here since \u03be1 6= \u03be2\nand the length of \u2202T S is strictly less than \u03c0/2.\n\nRecall (see [X2]) if X is a CAT(0) 2-complex that admits an isometric cocompact\naction, then for any \u03be \u2208 \u2202T X and any r : 0 < r < \u03c02 , the metric ball B(\u03be, r) is an\nR-tree. It is necessary to distinguish those points in \u2202T X that are \"dead ends\".\nDefinition 4.6. Let X be a CAT (0) 2-complex and \u03be \u2208 \u2202T X. We say \u03be is a terminal\npoint if \u03be does not lie in the interior of any geodesic segment in \u2202T X.\nLemmas 4.4 and 4.5 easily imply the following proposition.\nProposition 4.7. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex that admits a proper, cocompact\naction by cellular isometries, and \u03c3 : [0, l] \u2192 \u2202T X be a geodesic segment with length\nl > \u03c0/2. If \u03c3(0) and \u03c3(l) are not terminal points, then there are numbers 0 \u2264 t1 <\nt2 < * * * < tn \u2264 l with the following properties:\n(i) t1 < \u03c0/2, l \u2212 tn < \u03c0/2 and ti+1 = ti + \u03c0/2 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1;\n(ii) {\u03c3(t1 ), * * * , \u03c3(tn )} is the set of singular points on \u03c3.\nIn particular, if \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X are singular but not terminal points and dT (\u03be, \u03b7) < \u221e,\nthen dT (\u03be, \u03b7) is an integral multiple of \u03c0/2.\nNotice Proposition 4.7 implies the length of any simple closed geodesic in \u2202T X is\nan integral multiple of \u03c0/2.\nSince small metric balls in \u2202T X are R-trees, it makes sense to talk about branch\npoints in \u2202T X. By using Theorem 4.1 it is not hard to prove the following result:\nProposition 4.8. ([X2]) Let X be a CAT (0) square complex that admits a proper,\ncocompact action by cellular isometries. Then any branch point in \u2202T X is a singular\npoint.\n4.2\n\n\u03c0-Visibility\n\nLet X be a locally compact CAT (0) space and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X with dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0. If there\nis a geodesic c in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints, then c bounds a flat half-plane (see\n[BH]). In general, there is no geodesic in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints.\nTheorem 4.9. Let X be a CAT (0) 2-complex that admits a proper, cocompact action\nby cellular isometries. If \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X are not terminal points and dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2265 \u03c0, then\nthere is a geodesic in X with \u03be and \u03b7 as endpoints.\nProof. By Proposition 2.1 we may assume dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0. Let \u03c3 : [0, \u03c0] \u2192 \u2202T X be a\nminimal geodesic from \u03be to \u03b7. Since \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X are not terminal points and small\nmetric balls in \u2202T X are R-trees, there is some \u01eb, 0 < \u01eb < \u03c0/4 such that \u03c3 extends to\na locally isometric map [\u2212\u01eb, \u03c0 + \u01eb] \u2192 \u2202T X, which is still denoted by \u03c3.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n15\n\nNotice \u03c3|[\u2212\u01eb,\u03c0/2+\u01eb] is a minimal geodesic in \u2202T X with length less than \u03c0. By\nTheorem 4.1 there is a flat sector S1 in X such that \u2202T S1 = \u03c3([\u2212\u01eb/2, \u03c0/2 + \u01eb/2]).\nSimilarly there is a flat sector S2 in X with \u2202T S2 = \u03c3([\u03c0/2\u2212\u01eb/2, \u03c0+\u01eb/2]). Since X is a\n2-complex and \u2202T S1 \u2229\u2202T S2 = \u03c3([\u03c0/2\u2212\u01eb/2, \u03c0/2+\u01eb/2]) is a nontrivial interval, we have\nS1 \u2229S2 6= \u03c6. Pick x \u2208 S1 \u2229S2 and let S \u2282 S1 \u2229S2 be the subsector with cone point x and\n\u2202T S = \u03c3([\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u01eb/2, \u03c0/2 + \u01eb/2]). Fix a point p in the interior of the flat sector S, and\nlet c1 , c2 , c3 be rays starting from p belonging to \u03c3(0), \u03c3(\u03c0) and \u03c3(\u03c0/2) respectively.\nSince c1 and c3 are contained in the flat sector S1 , \u2220p (c1 (\u221e), c3 (\u221e)) = \u03c0/2. Similarly\n\u2220p (c2 (\u221e), c3 (\u221e)) = \u03c0/2. Since the initial segment of each ci is contained in the flat\nsector S, it is clear that the angle \u2220p (c1 (\u221e), c2(\u221e)) = \u03c0. It follows that c1 \u222a c2 is a\ncomplete geodesic in X with endpoints \u03be and \u03b7.\nRemark 4.10. The conclusion of Theorem 4.9 does not hold if X is not a CAT (0)\n2-complex. For instance, the universal covers of nonpositively curved 3-dimensional\ngraph manifolds ([BS], [CK]) are counterexamples.\n\n5\n\nFake Planes and Short Loops in the Tits Boundary\n\nThe goal of this section is to prove Proposition 5.9, which provides a criterion for the\nexistence of a simple geodesic loop with length 5\u03c0\nin the Tits boundary of a CAT (0)\n2\nsquare complex. This result shall be used in Sections 6 and 7.\n5.1\n\nSupport Sets of Short Closed Geodesics in \u2202T X\n\nLet X be a CAT (0) 2-complex and x \u2208 X. There is a map logx : \u2202T X \u2192 Link(X, x)\nthat sends \u03be \u2208 \u2202T X to the tangent vector of x\u03be at x. Clearly logx is distance nonincreasing: dx (logx (\u03be), logx (\u03b7)) \u2264 dT (\u03be, \u03b7) for any \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u2202T X.\nDefinition 5.1. Let X be a CAT (0) 2-complex and c \u2282 \u2202T X a simple closed geodesic\nin \u2202T X. The support set supp(c) \u2282 X of c is defined as follows: x \u2208 supp(c) if the\nloop logx (c) represents a nontrivial class in H1 (Link(X, x)).\nRecall Cr (c) denotes the Euclidean cone over c with radius r > 0 (Section 2.1).\nSince c is a circle, Cr (c) is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk in the plane. Let\n\u2202Cr (c) be the boundary circle of Cr (c). For any x \u2208 X and any r > 0, the map\nfx,r : Cr (c) \u2192 X is defined by fx,r (t\u03be) = \u03b3x\u03be (t), \u03be \u2208 c, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 r. Clearly fx,r\nrepresents a class in H2 (X, X \u2212 {x}). By using homotopy along geodesic segments\nit is easy to see that for any r, r \u2032 > 0, the two maps fx,r and fx,r\u2032 represent the same\nclass in H2 (X, X \u2212 {x}), that is, [fx,r ] = [fx,r\u2032 ] \u2208 H2 (X, X \u2212 {x}).\nLemma 5.2. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) 2-complex, x \u2208 X and c \u2282 \u2202T X\na simple closed geodesic in \u2202T X. Then x \u2208 supp(c) if and only if fx,r represents a\nnontrivial class in H2 (X, X \u2212 {x}) for any r > 0.\n\n\f16\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nProof. Since X is locally compact and piecewise Euclidean, for each x \u2208 X and each\nr > 0 there is some r \u2032 with 0 < r \u2032 \u2264 r such that the closed metric ball B(x, r \u2032 ) is\nisometric to the Euclidean cone Cr\u2032 (Link(X, x)) over Link(X, x) with radius r \u2032 . By\nthe remark before the lemma, [fx,r ] = [fx,r\u2032 ] \u2208 H2 (X, X \u2212 {x}).\nSet B = B(x, r \u2032 ). The exact sequence of the pair (B, B \u2212 {x}) gives us an\nisomorphism \u2202 : H2 (B, B \u2212 {x}) \u2192 H1 (B \u2212 {x}). Note H1 (B \u2212 {x}) \u223c\n= H1 (\u2202B)\nand the map logx : \u2202B \u2192 Link(X, x) which sends y to the direction of xy at x is a\nhomeomorphism. Now observe that \u2202 sends [fx,r\u2032 ] \u2208 H2 (X, X\u2212{x}) \u223c\n= H2 (B, B\u2212{x})\nto [logx (c)] \u2208 H1 (Link(X, x)) \u223c\n= H1 (\u2202B) \u223c\n= H1 (B \u2212 {x}).\nLemma 5.3. If a simple closed geodesic c in \u2202T X has length strictly less than 4\u03c0 and\nx \u2208 supp(c), then logx (c) is homotopic to a simple closed geodesic in Link(X, x).\nProof. Note Link(X, x) is a finite metric graph where each simple loop has length at\nleast 2\u03c0. The loop logx (c) is homotopic to a closed geodesic cx in Link(X, x) whose\nlength does not exceed the length of logx (c). If cx is not simple, then its length must\nbe at least 4\u03c0. The lemma follows.\n\nLet c be a simple closed geodesic in \u2202T X with length strictly less than 4\u03c0 and\nx \u2208 supp(c). By Lemma 5.3 logx (c) is homotopic to a simple loop cx in Link(X, x).\nFor each x \u2208 supp(c), let S(x) be the union of all closed 2-cells of X that give rise\nto cx . Since cx is a simple loop, S(x) is homeomorphic to the closed unit disk in the\nEuclidean plane.\nLemma 5.4. Let c \u2282 \u2202T X be a simple closed geodesic with length(c) < 4\u03c0. Then\nfor each x \u2208 supp(c), there is some r > 0 with supp(c) \u2229 B(x, r) = S(x) \u2229 B(x, r).\nProof. For x \u2208 supp(c), choose rx such that B(x, rx ) is isometric to the Euclidean\ncone Crx (Link(X, x)) over Link(X, x) with radius rx . Set K = B(x, rx /2). Notice\nfx,rx represents a class in H2 (X, X \u2212 K). By Lemma 5.3 logx (c) is homotopic to a\nsimple closed geodesic in Link(X, x). It then follows from the definitions of S(x) and\nfx,rx that [fx,rx ] = [S(x) \u2229 B(x, rx )] \u2208 H2 (X, X \u2212 K).\nFor any y \u2208 B(x, rx /4), by using homotopy along geodesic segments we see fy,rx\nand fx,rx as maps from (Crx (c), \u2202Crx (c)) into the pair (X, X \u2212 K) are homotopic. As\na result, [fy,rx ] = [fx,rx ] \u2208 H2 (X, X \u2212 K). Combining with the observation from last\nparagraph we see [fy,rx ] = [S(x) \u2229 B(x, rx )] \u2208 H2 (X, X \u2212 K). It follows that for any\ny \u2208 B(x, rx /4), fy,rx represents a nontrivial class in H2 (X, X \u2212 {y}) if and only if\nS(x) \u2229 B(x, rx ) represents a nontrivial class in H2 (X, X \u2212 {y}). Recall S(x) \u2229 B(x, rx )\nis homeomorphic to the closed unit disk in the Euclidean plane. Now it follows\neasily from excision that for any y \u2208 B(x, rx /4), fy,rx represents a nontrivial class in\nH2 (X, X \u2212 {y}) if and only if y \u2208 B(x, rx /4) \u2229 (S(x) \u2229 B(x, rx )) = S(x) \u2229 B(x, rx /4).\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n17\n\nA similar argument shows the complement of supp(c) in X is open:\nLemma 5.5. Let c \u2282 \u2202T X be a simple closed geodesic in \u2202T X with length strictly\nless than 4\u03c0. Then supp(c) is a closed subset of X.\nProposition 5.6. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) square complex and c \u2282 \u2202T X\na simple closed geodesic in \u2202T X with length at most 2.5\u03c0. Then supp(c) is a closed\nconvex subset of X and is homeomorphic to the plane.\nProof. Lemma 5.4 implies supp(c) is a 2-dimensional manifold. We claim supp(c) is\nlocally convex in X. Fix x \u2208 supp(c) and let cx be the simple loop in Link(X, x)\nhomotopic to logx (c). Let r > 0 be the number from Lemma 5.4. In particular\nB(x, r) is isometric to the Euclidean cone Cr (Link(X, x)) over the link Link(X, x)\nwith radius r. We write a point P \u2208 Cr (Link(X, x)) as P = t\u03be where 0 \u2264 t \u2264 r\nand \u03be \u2208 Link(X, x). Lemma 5.4 implies supp(c) \u2229 B(x, r) \u2282 B(x, r) is isometric to\n{t\u03be : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 r, \u03be \u2208 cx } \u2282 Cr (Link(X, x)). We need to show {t\u03be : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 r, \u03be \u2208 cx }\nis convex in Cr (Link(X, x)).\nLet A \u2282 Link(X, x) be a subset. Then it is not hard to check that the subset\n{t\u03be : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 r, \u03be \u2208 A} is convex in Cr (Link(X, x)) if and only if for any a, b \u2208 A with\ndx (a, b) < \u03c0, A contains the minimal geodesic ab in Link(X, x) from a to b. Since\nX is a CAT (0) square complex and the length of c is at most 2.5\u03c0, cx has length 2\u03c0\nor 2.5\u03c0. Now it is easy to check that for any a, b \u2208 cx with dx (a, b) < \u03c0, cx contains\nthe minimal geodesic ab in Link(X, x) from a to b. It follows that supp(c) is locally\nconvex in X. Since supp(c) is also closed, it is convex in X. Therefore with the\ninduced metric, supp(c) is a CAT (0) space. In particular supp(c) is contractible. As\na contractible surface supp(c) is homeomorphic to the plane.\n\nLet X and c be as in Proposition 5.6. Then supp(c) is a subcomplex of X. If\nwe equip supp(c) with the path metric, then supp(c) is a CAT (0) square complex\nand the inclusion supp(c) \u2282 X is an isometric embedding. It follows that \u2202\u221e supp(c)\nnaturally embeds into \u2202\u221e X. We identify \u2202\u221e supp(c) with its embedding in \u2202\u221e X.\nLemma 5.7. Let X be a locally compact CAT (0) square complex and c \u2282 \u2202T X a\nsimple closed geodesic in \u2202T X with length at most 2.5\u03c0. Then \u2202\u221e supp(c) = c.\nProof. We first show \u2202\u221e supp(c) \u2282 c. Fix a point p \u2208 supp(c) and let \u03be \u2208 \u2202\u221e supp(c).\nWe need to show \u03be \u2208 c. Since c is a closed subset of \u2202\u221e X it suffices to show that for\nany t \u2265 0 there is some \u03b7 \u2208 c with \u03b3p\u03be (t) \u2208 p\u03b7.\nSuppose there is some t0 such that \u03b3p\u03be (t0 ) \u2208\n/ p\u03b7 for any \u03b7 \u2208 c. Let q = \u03b3p\u03be (t0 )\nand K = B(p, 2t0 ). The proof of Lemma 5.4 shows that fp,4t0 and fq,4t0 represent\nthe same class in H2 (X, X \u2212 K). Let i\u2217 : H2 (X, X \u2212 K) \u2192 H2 (X, X \u2212 {q}) be the\nhomomorphism induced by the inclusion. The assumption q \u2208\n/ p\u03b7 for any \u03b7 \u2208 c implies\n\n\f18\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nq does not lie in the image of fp,4t0 and thus i\u2217 ([fp,4t0 ]) = 0 \u2208 H2 (X, X\u2212{q}). It follows\nthat i\u2217 ([fq,4t0 ]) = 0 \u2208 H2 (X, X \u2212 {q}), which implies q \u2208\n/ supp(c), a contradiction.\nsupp(c) is a CAT (0) square complex and is homeomorphic to the plane. It follows from [KO] that \u2202\u221e supp(c) is homeomorphic to a circle. Now it is clear that\n\u2202\u221e supp(c) = c since \u2202\u221e supp(c) is a circle embedded in the circle c.\n\n5.2\n\nFake Planes\n\nThe standard quarter plane is the first quadrant {(x, y) \u2208 E2 : x \u2265 0, y \u2265 0} with\nthe obvious square complex structure. A quarter plane in a CAT (0) square complex\nX is the image of a cellular embedding from the standard quarter plane into X. The\nimage of the origin is called the cone point of the quarter plane. The Euclidean plane\nclearly is the union of four quarter planes with a common cone point.\nDefinition 5.8. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex. A subcomplex of X is a fake\nplane if it is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane and is the union of five quarter\nplanes with the same cone point and disjoint interiors.\nIt follows from the proof of Proposition 5.6 that a fake plane in a CAT (0) square\ncomplex is convex. It is also clear if F \u2032 is a fake plane then \u2202T F \u2032 \u2282 \u2202T X is a simple\nclosed geodesic with length 2.5\u03c0.\nProposition 5.9. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex. Then there exists a simple\nin \u2202T X if and only if there exists a fake plane in X.\nclosed geodesic with length 5\u03c0\n2\nProof. One direction is clear. Let c \u2282 \u2202T X be a simple closed geodesic with length\n5\u03c0\nand supp(c) \u2282 X its support set. We shall prove that supp(c) is a fake plane.\n2\nBy Proposition 5.6 and Lemma 5.7 supp(c) is a closed convex subset of X with\n\u2202\u221e supp(c) = c. It follows that the embedding \u2202\u221e supp(c) \u2282 \u2202\u221e X is an isometric\nembedding in the angular metric. Since c is a geodesic in \u2202T X, \u2202T supp(c) is also a\ngeodesic in the Tits metric. Therefore \u2202T supp(c) has length 2.5\u03c0.\nNow supp(c) is a piecewise Euclidean CAT (0) 2-complex which is homeomorphic\nto the plane. It follows from [KO] that the difference 2\u03c0 \u2212 length(\u2202T supp(c)) equals\nthe total curvature on supp(c). Since supp(c) is a square complex, 2-cells are flat,\nedges are geodesics and only vertices can contribute to curvature. Notice each vertex\ncontributes either 0 or at most \u2212\u03c0/2. Since 2\u03c0 \u2212 length(\u2202T supp(c)) = \u2212\u03c0/2, we\nsee there is exactly one vertex v \u2208 supp(c) such that there are 5 squares in supp(c)\nincident to v. At every other vertex v \u2032 of supp(c) there are exactly 4 squares incident\nto v \u2032 . Now it is easy to see that supp(c) is a fake plane.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n19\n\nIf F \u2032 is a fake plane in a CAT (0) square complex X and x \u2208 F \u2032 is the common\ncone point of its five quarter planes, then Link(F \u2032 , x) \u2282 Link(X, x) is a simple loop\nconsisting of 5 edges. The following corollary provides a practical sufficient condition\nfor the nonexistence of simple closed geodesic with length 2.5\u03c0 in \u2202T X, especially\nwhen X admits a cocompact action.\nCorollary 5.10. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex. If no vertex link of X contains\na simple loop consisting of 5 edges, then there is no simple closed geodesic with length\n2.5\u03c0 in \u2202T X.\n\n6\n\nGroups Containing Generic Elements\n\nLet X be a CAT (0) square complex, G a group acting properly and cocompactly by\ncellular isometries on X and H < G a subgroup of G. Our goal in Sections 6 and\n7 is to prove Theorem 1.1. In this section we consider the case when the group H\ncontains generic elements. The main result of this section is Theorem 6.4.\n6.1\n\nParallel Set and Generic Elements\n\nLet g be a hyperbolic isometry of X, and Pg = Y \u00d7 R its parallel set. Since X is a\n2-complex, Y is a tree.\nLemma 6.1. Let g \u2208 G be a hyperbolic isometry of X, and Pg = Y \u00d7 R its parallel\nset. Then the number of ends of the tree Y is one of the following: 0, 2, \u221e.\nProof. Notice g(Pg ) = Pg and g|Pg = (g1 , T ) : Y \u00d7 R \u2192 Y \u00d7 R where g1 is an isometry\nof Y and T is a translation of R. Suppose the number of ends of Y is finite. Then there\nis an integer n such that g1n fixes all the ends of Y . It follows that Min(g n ) = Y \u2032 \u00d7 R,\nwhere Y \u2032 \u2282 Y contains the core of Y (the core of Y is the union of all geodesics\nbetween the ends of Y ). Y \u2032 has the same number of ends as Y . By Theorem 2.5,\nCgn (G) leaves Min(g n ) invariant and acts on Min(g n ) properly and cocompactly. It\nfollows that Cgn (G)/ < g n > acts properly and cocompactly on Y \u2032 . Thus the number\nof ends of Y \u2032 equals the number of ends of the group Cgn (G)/ < g n >, which takes\nthe values 0, 1, 2 or \u221e. It can not be 1 since any one-ended tree does not admit any\nproper and cocompact group action.\nWe notice g is of rank one if and only if Y has 0 ends.\nTheorem 6.2. Let X be a CAT (0) square complex, G a group acting properly and\ncocompactly by cellular isometries on X, and g1 , g2 \u2208 G two hyperbolic isometries. If\ndT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2265 \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {g1 (+\u221e), g1(\u2212\u221e)} and any \u03b7 \u2208 {g2 (+\u221e), g2(\u2212\u221e)}, then\nthe subgroup generated by g1 and g2 contains a free group of rank two.\n\n\f20\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nProof. If one of g1 , g2 is of rank one, then the theorem follows from Corollary 3.4.\nAssume none of g1 , g2 is of rank one. Then by Lemma 6.1 the four points g1 (+\u221e),\ng1 (\u2212\u221e), g2 (+\u221e), g2 (\u2212\u221e) are not terminal points and the theorem follows from\nTheorems 3.7 and 4.9.\n\nRecall a flat in a CAT (0) 2-complex is the image of an isometric embedding from\nthe Euclidean plane into the CAT (0) 2-complex.\nDefinition 6.3. Let g be a hyperbolic isometry of X and Pg = Y \u00d7 R its parallel\nset. We call g a generic element if Pg is a flat and the axes of g are not parallel to\nany edges in Pg . We say g is a special element if g is neither generic nor of rank one.\nBy Lemma 6.1 we see if g is a special element, then g(+\u221e) and g(\u2212\u221e) are singular\npoints in \u2202T X.\nBy Proposition 4.7 there are exactly four singular points on each unit circle in\n\u2202T X. These four singular points are evenly spaced on the circle. For a generic element\ng, set \u03b1g = min{dT (g(+\u221e), s) : s \u2208 \u2202T Pg is a singular point}. Clearly 0 < \u03b1g \u2264 \u03c0/4.\nNow we are ready to state the main theorem of Section 6.\nTheorem 6.4. With the assumptions of Theorem 1.1. If a subgroup H of G contains\na generic element, then H either is virtually free abelian or contains a free group of\nrank two.\nRemark 6.5. Theorem 6.4 holds without assuming there is no fake plane in X. The\nproof in the general case is similar but longer.\nThe proof of Theorem 6.4 shall be completed in the next two sections. We first\nneed to look at the relative position of the parallel sets of two generic elements.\nLemma 6.6. Let h \u2208 H be a generic element. If k(\u2202T Ph ) = \u2202T Ph for all k \u2208 H,\nthen the group H is virtually free abelian.\nProof. By a theorem of Leeb ([L]), F \u2192 \u2202T F is a 1-1 correspondence between the\nset of flats in X and the set of unit circles in \u2202T X. Thus k(\u2202T Ph ) = \u2202T Ph implies\nk(Ph ) = Ph . It follows that the flat Ph is invariant under the action of H and the\nlemma follows from Bieberbach's theorem.\n\nLemma 6.7. Let h, k \u2208 H be generic elements. Then one of the following holds:\n(i) \u2202T Ph = \u2202T Pk ; in this case < h, k > is virtually free abelian;\n(ii) \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk = \u03c6;\n(iii) \u2202T Ph 6= \u2202T Pk and \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk 6= \u03c6; in this case < h2 , k 2 > is free of rank two.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n21\n\nProof. If \u2202T Ph = \u2202T Pk , then Ph = Pk and both h and k leave invariant the flat\nPh = Pk . It follows from Bieberbach's theorem that < h, k > is virtually free abelian.\nNow suppose \u2202T Ph 6= \u2202T Pk and \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk 6= \u03c6. Then for some \u01eb > 0, the\nintersection N\u01eb (Ph ) \u2229 N\u01eb (Pk ) is nonempty and unbounded. Notice Min(h2 ) = Ph\nand Min(k 2 ) = Pk . By Theorem 2.5, Ch2 (G) leaves invariant Ph and acts on Ph\nproperly and cocompactly. Similarly for Ck2 (G) and Pk . By Theorem 2.4, the group\nCh2 (G) \u2229 Ck2 (G) acts properly and cocompactly on N\u01eb (Ph ) \u2229 N\u01eb (Pk ). Since the set\nN\u01eb (Ph ) \u2229 N\u01eb (Pk ) is unbounded, a theorem of E. Swenson ([Sw]) implies there exists\na hyperbolic isometry g \u2208 Ch2 (G) \u2229 Ck2 (G). Then both h2 and k 2 commute with g\nand leave Pg invariant. Pg splits Pg = Y \u00d7 R where Y is a tree. Since h2 and k 2\nare generic elements and \u2202T Ph 6= \u2202T Pk , the axes of h2 and k 2 are not parallel to the\naxes of g. It follows that there are geodesics c1 , c2 \u2282 Y such that Ph = c1 \u00d7 R and\nPk = c2 \u00d7 R. \u2202T Ph 6= \u2202T Pk implies c1 and c2 share at most one end. If c1 and c2 share\nexactly one end, then Ph \u2229 Pk is a flat half-plane. On the other hand by Theorem\n2.4 the group Ch2 (G) \u2229 Ck2 (G) acts cocompactly on Ph \u2229 Pk . This is a contradiction\nsince no group acts cocompactly on a flat half-plane. Therefore c1 and c2 share no\nend. In this case it is easy to see < h2 , k 2 > is free of rank two by looking at the\ninduced actions of h2 and k 2 on Y .\n\n6.2\n\nWhen the Minimal Set Contains Singular Points\n\nWe prove Theorem 6.4 in this section and Section 6.3.\nWe assume H neither is virtually free abelian nor contains a free group of rank two\nand will derive a contradiction from this. By Corollary 3.4 we conclude H contains\nno rank one isometries. Let \u039b(H) \u2282 \u2202\u221e X be the limit set of H and M \u2282 \u039b(H)\na minimal set of H. Theorem 2.7 implies dT (\u03be, m) \u2264 \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 \u039b(H) and any\nm \u2208 M. In particular, dT (m, g(+\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0, dT (m, g(\u2212\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0 for any hyperbolic\nisometry g \u2208 H and any m \u2208 M (since g(+\u221e), g(\u2212\u221e) \u2208 \u039b(H)).\nSince M is closed and H-invariant, Theorem 2.2 implies for any hyperbolic isometry g \u2208 H, M \u2229 \u2202T Pg 6= \u03c6. By last paragraph g is not a rank one isometry. Lemma\n6.1 implies a point in \u2202T Pg \u2283 M \u2229 \u2202T Pg is either singular or regular.\nLet h \u2208 H be a generic element. By Lemma 6.6 there is some k \u2208 H such that\nk(\u2202T Ph ) 6= \u2202T Ph . Let h\u2032 = khk \u22121 . Then h, h\u2032 \u2208 H are two generic elements with\n\u2202T Ph 6= \u2202T Ph\u2032 . By Lemma 6.7 \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Ph\u2032 = \u03c6. Also notice \u03b1h = \u03b1h\u2032 .\nIn this section we prove Theorem 6.4 when the minimal set M contains singular\npoints:\nProposition 6.8. Theorem 6.4 holds if there is a generic element h0 \u2208 H such that\nM \u2229 \u2202T Ph0 contains a singular point.\nSuppose h \u2208 H is a generic element and s \u2208 M \u2212 \u2202T Ph is a singular point but\nnot a terminal point. Then dT (h(\u2212\u221e), s) \u2264 \u03c0. Since h(\u2212\u221e) is a regular point\n\n\f22\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nand s is a singular point Proposition 4.7 implies dT (h(\u2212\u221e), s) < \u03c0 and there is at\nmost one singular point in the interior of the geodesic segment h(\u2212\u221e)s. On the\nother hand, since s \u2208\n/ \u2202T Ph there is some \u03be in the interior of h(\u2212\u221e)s such that\nh(\u2212\u221e)s \u2229 \u2202T Ph = h(\u2212\u221e)\u03be. \u03be is a branch point, and by Proposition 4.8 it is also a\nsingular point. Notice dT (\u03be, s) = \u03c0/2.\nLemma 6.9. Suppose h \u2208 H is a generic element, s \u2208 M \u2212 \u2202T Ph is a singular\npoint but not a terminal point and \u03be is the unique singular point in the interior of\nh(\u2212\u221e)s. Denote by \u03b7 the unique point on \u2202T Ph with dT (\u03b7, h(\u2212\u221e)) = dT (s, h(\u2212\u221e))\nand dT (\u03b7, \u03be) = \u03c0/2. Then \u03b7 \u2208 M and is a singular point. Similarly, if \u03be \u2032 is the\nunique singular point in the interior of h(+\u221e)s and \u03b7 \u2032 is the unique point on \u2202T Ph\nwith dT (\u03b7 \u2032 , h(+\u221e)) = dT (s, h(+\u221e)) and dT (\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) = \u03c0/2. Then \u03b7 \u2032 \u2208 M and is a\nsingular point.\nProof. We prove the claim on \u03b7, the proof for \u03b7 \u2032 is similar. By Proposition 4.7 \u03b7 is a\nsingular point. By replacing h with h2 if necessary we may assume Min(h) = Ph . In\nparticular h(\u03be) = \u03be. Let s\u2032 \u2208 \u2202\u221e X be an accumulation point (in the cone topology)\nof the set {hi (s) : i \u2265 1}. We see s\u2032 \u2208 M since s \u2208 M and M is H-invariant and\nclosed. Notice dT (h(\u2212\u221e), s) = \u2220T (h(\u2212\u221e), s) since dT (h(\u2212\u221e), s) < \u03c0 (Proposition\n2.1). By Theorem 2.2 we have s\u2032 \u2208 \u2202T Ph and dT (h(\u2212\u221e), s\u2032 ) = dT (h(\u2212\u221e), s). On the\nother hand, h(\u03be) = \u03be and a subsequence of {hi (s) : i \u2265 1} converges to s\u2032 in the cone\ntopology. Proposition 2.1(iii) implies dT (\u03be, s\u2032 ) \u2264 dT (\u03be, s) = \u03c0/2. It now follows that\ndT (\u03be, s\u2032) = \u03c0/2, that is s\u2032 = \u03b7.\n\nLemma 6.9 and the assumption in Proposition 6.8 imply for any generic element\nh \u2208 H, \u2202T Ph \u2229 M contains a singular point.\nLemma 6.10. Let h \u2208 H be a generic element, and s \u2208 M \u2212 \u2202T Ph a singular but not\na terminal point. Let \u03be1 , \u03be2 be the unique singular points in the interior of sh(+\u221e)\nand sh(\u2212\u221e) respectively. Then sh(+\u221e) \u2229 sh(\u2212\u221e) = {s} and dT (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) = \u03c0.\nProof. Suppose sh(+\u221e) \u2229 sh(\u2212\u221e) = s\u03be is a nontrivial segment. Then \u03be is a\nsingular point since it is a branch point. Proposition 4.7 implies dT (s, \u03be) = \u03c0/2.\nSince dT (s, h(+\u221e)) < \u03c0 and dT (s, h(\u2212\u221e)) < \u03c0, we have dT (\u03be, h(+\u221e)) < \u03c0/2 and\ndT (\u03be, h(\u2212\u221e)) < \u03c0/2. It follows that dT (h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)) < \u03c0, a contradiction.\nBy the paragraph preceding Lemma 6.9, \u03be1 , \u03be2 \u2208 \u2202T Ph . If dT (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) = \u03c0/2, then\n\u03be1 s \u222a s\u03be2 \u222a \u03be2 \u03be1 is a simple closed geodesic with length 1.5\u03c0 in the CAT (1) space \u2202T X,\na contradiction.\n\nNow we can complete the proof of Proposition 6.8.\nProof of Proposition 6.8. There are two generic elements h, k \u2208 H such that\n\u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk = \u03c6 and \u03b1h = \u03b1k . After replacing h and k with h2 and k 2 if necessary\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n23\n\nwe may assume Min(h) = Ph and Min(k) = Pk . By Theorem 2.2 the fixed point sets\nof h and k in \u2202\u221e X are \u2202T Ph and \u2202T Pk respectively.\nLet \u03b73 \u2208 \u2202T Pk \u2229 M be a singular point, and \u03be1 , \u03be2 be singular points in the interior\nof h(\u2212\u221e)\u03b73 and h(+\u221e)\u03b73 respectively. Then \u03be1 , \u03be2 \u2208 \u2202T Ph . Lemma 6.10 implies\ndT (\u03be1 , \u03be2) = \u03c0. By Lemma 6.9 the other two singular points (denoted by \u03b71 , \u03b72 ) on\n\u2202T Ph lie in M. Let \u03be3 , \u03be4 be the two singular points on \u2202T Pk that have distance \u03c0/2\nfrom \u03b73 , and \u03b74 the singular point on \u2202T Pk with dT (\u03b73 , \u03b74 ) = \u03c0. Since by assumption\nthere is no fake plane in X, Proposition 5.9 implies there is no simple closed geodesic\nwith length 2.5\u03c0 in \u2202T X. Of course there is also no simple closed geodesic with\nlength 1.5\u03c0 in the CAT (1) space \u2202T X. By considering the unique singular points\nin the interior of the geodesic segments from k(+\u221e) and k(\u2212\u221e) to \u03b7i (i = 1, 2),\nwe see dT (\u03b7i , \u03bej ) = \u03c0/2 for i = 1, 2 and j = 3, 4. Now Lemma 6.9 applied to the\ngeneric element k or k \u22121 and singular point \u03b71 \u2208 M \u2212 \u2202T Pk implies \u03b74 \u2208 M. Again\nby considering the unique singular points in the interior of h(+\u221e)\u03b74 and h(\u2212\u221e)\u03b74 ,\nwe conclude dT (\u03bei , \u03b7j ) = \u03c0/2 for any i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nWe may assume dT (k(+\u221e), \u03b73) < \u03c0/2 by replacing k with k \u22121 if necessary. Note\nthe choice of \u03be2 implies dT (h(+\u221e), \u03be2) < \u03c0/2. If dT (h(+\u221e), \u03be2 ) + dT (\u03b73 , k(+\u221e)) =\n\u03c0/2, then it is easy to check that dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} and any\n\u03b7 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}. Now Theorem 6.2 implies that < h, k > contains a free group\nof rank two.\nIf dT (h(+\u221e), \u03be2) + dT (\u03b73 , k(+\u221e)) 6= \u03c0/2, we consider hkh\u22121 and k instead of\nh and k. Notice \u2202T Phkh\u22121 = h(\u2202T Pk ) 6= \u2202T Pk . If \u2202T Phkh\u22121 \u2229 \u2202T Pk 6= \u03c6, then by\nLemma 6.7 < hkh\u22121 , k > contains a free group of rank two and we are done. Assume\n\u2202T Phkh\u22121 \u2229\u2202T Pk = \u03c6. Since dT (\u03b71 , \u03be3 ) = dT (\u03b71 , h(\u03be3 )) = \u03c0/2, we see dT (\u03be3 , h(\u03be3 )) = \u03c0.\nThe argument on h and k shows that dT (\u03bei , h(\u03b7j )) = dT (h(\u03bei ), \u03b7j ) = \u03c0/2 for any\ni, j \u2208 {3, 4}. Notice now we have dT (hkh\u22121 (+\u221e), h(\u03be4)) + dT (\u03b73 , k(+\u221e)) = \u03c0/2.\nNow it is easy to see dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {hkh\u22121 (+\u221e), hkh\u22121 (\u2212\u221e)} and any\n\u03b7 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} and Theorem 6.2 completes the proof.\n\n6.3\n\nWhen the Minimal Set Contains Regular Points\n\nIn this section we prove Theorem 6.4 when the minimal set M contains regular points:\nProposition 6.11. Theorem 6.4 holds if there is a generic element h0 \u2208 H such that\nM \u2229 \u2202T Ph0 contains a regular point.\nWe notice Theorem 6.4 follows from Propositions 6.8 and 6.11.\nThe proof of Proposition 6.11 is similar to that of Proposition 6.8. We assume\nH neither is virtually free abelian nor contains a free group of rank two and will\nderive a contradiction from this. As in Section 6.2 we see: there are two generic\nelements h, k \u2208 H such that \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk = \u03c6 and \u03b1h = \u03b1k ; dT (m, g(+\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0 and\ndT (m, g(\u2212\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0 for any hyperbolic isometry g \u2208 H and any m \u2208 M.\n\n\f24\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nLemma 6.12. Let h \u2208 H be a generic element and s1 , s2 \u2208\n/ \u2202T Ph singular but not\nterminal points with dT (s1 , s2 ) = \u03c0/2. Let \u03be0 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} and s3 , s4 the two\nsingular points on \u2202T Ph that have distance less than \u03c0/2 from \u03be0 . If m \u2208 M lies in the\ninterior of s1 s2 , then there are \u03be \u2208 {s3 , s4 } and \u03b7 \u2208 {s1 , s2 } such that dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0/2.\nProof. We have dT (\u03be0 , m) \u2264 \u03c0 by the paragraph preceding the lemma. Let \u03c3 be a\nminimal geodesic from m to \u03be0 . Since any branch point is a singular point, there are\n\u03be \u2208 {s3 , s4 } and \u03b7 \u2208 {s1 , s2 } such that \u03be and \u03b7 lie in the interior of \u03c3. Clearly \u03be 6= \u03b7.\nOn the other hand, dT (m, \u03be0 ) \u2264 \u03c0 and Proposition 4.7 imply there are at most two\nsingular points in the interior of \u03c3. Therefore dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0/2.\nLemma 6.13. Let h \u2208 H be an arbitrary generic element, \u03be = h(+\u221e) or h(\u2212\u221e),\nand s1 , s2 the two singular points on \u2202T Ph with dT (\u03be, si ) < \u03c0/2. Then the interior of\ns1 s2 contains a point of the minimal set M.\nProof. We may assume Min(h) = Ph by replacing h with h2 if necessary. Since\nwe assume H neither is virtually free abelian nor contains a free group of rank two,\nLemmas 6.6 and 6.7 imply that there is a generic element k \u2208 H with \u2202T Ph \u2229\u2202T Pk = \u03c6.\nNotice M \u2229 \u2202T Pk 6= \u03c6. By Proposition 6.8 we see M \u2229 \u2202T Pk contains no singular\npoints. Let m \u2208 M \u2229 \u2202T Pk be a regular point, and s\u20321 , s\u20322 the two singular points on\n\u2202T Pk with dT (m, s\u2032i ) < \u03c0/2. Also let s3 , s4 be the two singular points on \u2202T Ph other\nthan s1 and s2 , and \u03be \u2032 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} but \u03be \u2032 6= \u03be. Notice dT (\u03be \u2032 , m) \u2264 \u03c0. Let\n\u03c3 be a minimal geodesic from m to \u03be \u2032 . Lemma 6.12 implies there are \u03b71 \u2208 {s\u20321 , s\u20322 },\n\u03b72 \u2208 {s3 , s4 } such that \u03b71 and \u03b72 are the only singular points in the interior of \u03c3.\nNotice \u03c0/2 < dT (\u03b72 , m) < \u03c0 and dT (\u03be \u2032 , m) = dT (\u03be \u2032, \u03b72 ) + dT (\u03b72 , m).\nIf \u03be = h(+\u221e) then we define m\u2032 to be an accumulation point of {hi (m) : i \u2265 1},\notherwise, \u03be = h(\u2212\u221e) and we define m\u2032 to be an accumulation point of the set\n{h\u2212i (m) : i \u2265 1}. In either case, m\u2032 \u2208 M \u2229 \u2202T Ph . It follows from Theorem 2.2 that\ndT (m\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) = dT (m, \u03be \u2032). The proof of Lemma 6.9 shows\ndT (\u03be \u2032, m\u2032 ) = dT (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b72 ) + dT (\u03b72 , m\u2032 ).\nConsequently \u03b72 lies on a minimal geodesic from \u03be \u2032 to m\u2032 and dT (\u03b72 , m\u2032 ) = dT (\u03b72 , m).\nSince \u03c0/2 < dT (\u03b72 , m) < \u03c0, m\u2032 lies in the interior of s1 s2 .\n\nSince we assume there is no fake plane in X Proposition 5.9 implies there is no\nsimple closed geodesic with length 2.5\u03c0 in \u2202T X.\nLemma 6.14. Let h, k \u2208 H be generic elements with \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk = \u03c6 and \u03b1h = \u03b1k .\nIf there are \u03be0 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}, \u03b70 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} with dT (\u03be0, \u03b70 ) = \u03c0, then\ndT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}, \u03b7 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}. In particular,\n< h, k > contains a free group of rank two.\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n25\n\nProof. Let \u03c3 be a minimal geodesic from \u03be0 to \u03b70 , and \u03be1 \u2208 \u2202T Ph , \u03b71 \u2208 \u2202T Pk the only\ntwo singular points on \u03c3. Clearly dT (\u03be1 , \u03b71 ) = \u03c0/2 and dT (\u03be0 , \u03be1) + dT (\u03b71 , \u03b70 ) = \u03c0/2.\nLet \u03be0\u2032 and \u03b70\u2032 be defined by {\u03be0 , \u03be0\u2032 } = {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}, {\u03b70 , \u03b70\u2032 } = {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}.\nWe denote the singular points on \u2202T Ph by \u03be1 , \u03b73 , \u03be2 , \u03b74 such that the six points\n\u03be1 , \u03be0 , \u03b73 , \u03be2 , \u03be0\u2032 , \u03b74 are in cyclic order on \u2202T Ph . Similarly we denote the singular points\non \u2202T Pk by \u03b71 , \u03be3 , \u03b72 , \u03be4 such that the six points \u03b71 , \u03b70 , \u03be3 , \u03b72 , \u03b70\u2032 , \u03be4 are in cyclic order\non \u2202T Pk .\nLemma 6.13 implies each of the four segments \u03be1 \u03b73 , \u03be2 \u03b74 , \u03b71 \u03be3 , \u03b72 \u03be4 contains a\npoint of the minimal set M in its interior. Lemma 6.12 applied to the two segments\n\u03be1 \u03b73 and \u03b72 \u03be4 shows that at least one of the following holds: (1) dT (\u03be1 , \u03b72 ) = \u03c0/2;\n(2) dT (\u03be1 , \u03be4 ) = \u03c0/2; (3) dT (\u03b73 , \u03b72 ) = \u03c0/2; (4) dT (\u03b73 , \u03be4 ) = \u03c0/2. (2) can not hold since\notherwise \u03be1 \u03be4 \u222a \u03be4 \u03b71 \u222a \u03b71 \u03be1 is a simple closed geodesic with length 1.5\u03c0. (3) can not\nhold since otherwise \u03b71 \u03be1 \u222a \u03be1 \u03b73 \u222a \u03b73 \u03b72 \u222a \u03b72 \u03be4 \u222a \u03be4 \u03b71 is a simple closed geodesic with\nlength 2.5\u03c0. So either (1) or (4) holds.\nSuppose (1) holds. Then dT (\u03be0 , \u03b70\u2032 ) = \u03c0 since dT (\u03be0 , \u03be1 ) + dT (\u03be1 , \u03b72 ) + dT (\u03b72 , \u03b70\u2032 ) =\ndT (\u03be0 , \u03be1) + \u03c0/2 + dT (\u03b71 , \u03b70 ) = \u03c0. Apply Lemma 6.12 to the two segments \u03b74 \u03be2\nand \u03b71 \u03be3 . The argument in the preceding paragraph shows either dT (\u03b74 , \u03be3 ) = \u03c0/2\nor dT (\u03be2 , \u03b71 ) = \u03c0/2. If dT (\u03b74 , \u03be3 ) = \u03c0/2, then dT (\u03be0\u2032 , \u03b74 ) + dT (\u03b74 , \u03be3 ) + dT (\u03be3 , \u03b70 ) =\ndT (\u03be0\u2032 , \u03b74 )+\u03c0/2+dT (\u03be1 , \u03be0 ) = \u03c0. Thus dT (\u03be0\u2032 , \u03b70 ) = \u03c0. Similarly we show dT (\u03be0\u2032 , \u03b70 ) = \u03c0\nif dT (\u03be2 , \u03b71 ) = \u03c0/2. By applying Lemma 6.12 to the two segments \u03be2 \u03b74 and \u03be4 \u03b72 and\nusing a similar argument we also conclude dT (\u03be0\u2032 , \u03b70\u2032 ) = \u03c0.\nThe proof when (4) holds is similar.\n\nLemma 6.15. Let h, k \u2208 H be generic elements with \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk = \u03c6 and \u03b1h = \u03b1k .\nThen < h, k > contains a free group of rank two.\nProof. We may assume Min(h) = Ph after replacing h with h2 if necessary. Set\n\u03b70 = k(+\u221e). By Lemmas 6.12 and 6.13 we see there are singular points \u03be1 \u2208 \u2202T Ph ,\n\u03b71 , \u03b72 \u2208 \u2202T Pk with dT (\u03be1 , \u03b71 ) = \u03c0/2 and dT (\u03b70 , \u03b7i ) < \u03c0/2 (i = 1, 2).\nConsider hkh\u22121 , k and h(\u2202T Pk ), \u2202T Pk . Notice h(\u2202T Pk ) = \u2202T Phkh\u22121 . It follows\nfrom \u2202T Ph \u2229 \u2202T Pk = \u03c6 that \u2202T Pk 6= \u2202T Phkh\u22121 . By Lemma 6.7 we may assume\n\u2202T Pk \u2229 \u2202T Phkh\u22121 = \u03c6. Apply Lemma 6.12 to the two segments \u03b71 \u03b72 and h(\u03b71 )h(\u03b72 ).\nSince dT (\u03be1 , \u03b71 ) = dT (\u03be1 , h(\u03b71 )) = \u03c0/2, by using the fact that there is no simple\nclosed geodesic with length 1.5\u03c0 or 2.5\u03c0 in \u2202T X we see either dT (h(\u03b72 ), \u03b71 ) = \u03c0/2\nor dT (h(\u03b71 ), \u03b72 ) = \u03c0/2. In both cases we conclude that dT (\u03b70 , h(\u03b70 )) = \u03c0. Recall\n\u03b70 = k(+\u221e) and notice h(\u03b70 ) = hkh\u22121 (+\u221e). Now Lemma 6.14 applied to hkh\u22121\nand k implies that < hkh\u22121 , k > contains a free group of rank two.\n\nProposition 6.11 now follows from Lemma 6.15.\n\n\f26\n\n7\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nGroups Containing Special Elements\n\nIn Section 6 we studied subgroups containing generic elements. In this section we\nconsider subgroups containing special elements.\nTheorem 7.1. With the assumptions of Theorem 1.1. If a subgroup H of G contains\na special element, then H either is virtually free abelian or contains a free group of\nrank two.\nWe notice Theorem 1.1 follows from Corollary 3.4 and Theorems 6.4 and 7.1.\nAs in Section 6 we will prove Theorem 7.1 by assuming H neither is virtually free\nabelian nor contains a free group of rank two and then deriving a contradiction from\nthis. Let M be a minimal set of H. Then dT (\u03be, m) \u2264 \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 \u039b(H) and any\nm \u2208 M. We again consider two cases depending on whether M contains any singular\npoints.\n7.1\n\nWhen the Minimal Set Contains Regular Points\n\nIn this section we prove Theorem 7.1 when M contains regular points:\nProposition 7.2. Theorem 7.1 holds if there exists a special element h0 \u2208 H such\nthat M \u2229 \u2202T Ph0 contains a regular point.\nWe recall that if h \u2208 H is a special element, then h(+\u221e) and h(\u2212\u221e) are singular\npoints. Notice in the proof of the following four lemmas we do not have to assume\nthat M contains regular points.\nLemma 7.3. Let h, k \u2208 H be two special elements such that the four points h(+\u221e),\nh(\u2212\u221e), k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e) are all distinct. If there is some \u03be \u2208 \u2202T X such that\ndT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0/2 whenever \u03b7 is one of the four points h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e), k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e),\nthen < h, k > contains a free group of rank two.\nProof. Notice dT (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 ) = \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2032 \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}.\nLemma 7.4. Let h, k \u2208 H be two special elements. If dT (h(+\u221e), k(+\u221e)) = \u03c0/2,\ndT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2 and h fixes at least one of k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e), then H either\nis virtually free abelian or contains a free group of rank two.\nProof. The assumption implies \u2202T Min(h) \u2229 \u2202T Min(k) 6= \u03c6. There exists \u01eb > 0\nsuch that N\u01eb (Min(h)) \u2229 N\u01eb (Min(h)) is unbounded. Theorems 2.5 and 2.4 imply\nCh (G) \u2229 Ck (G) acts properly and cocompactly on N\u01eb (Min(h)) \u2229 N\u01eb (Min(h)). There\nis a hyperbolic isometry (see proof of Lemma 6.7) g \u2208 Ch (G) \u2229 Ck (G). Both h and k\ncommute with g. It follows that h(Pg ) = Pg , k(Pg ) = Pg . h is not of rank one implies\ng is not of rank one. Thus g is either generic or special. If g is generic, then Pg is a\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n27\n\nflat. In this case, < h, k > acts cocompactly on Pg , so contains a generic element and\nthe lemma follows from Theorem 6.4.\nSuppose g is a special element. Pg splits Pg = Y \u00d7 R where Y is a tree. The\nassumption implies one of h, k, say h has an axis of the form {y0 } \u00d7 R (y0 \u2208 Y ),\nand k has an axis of the form c \u00d7 {t0 } (t0 \u2208 R) where c \u2282 Y is a geodesic in Y .\nNotice h(c \u00d7 {t0 }) is an axis of hkh\u22121 and has the form h(c \u00d7 {t0 }) = c\u2032 \u00d7 {t1 } for\na geodesic c\u2032 \u2282 Y and some t1 \u2208 R. Recall in a discrete group, the axes of any two\nhyperbolic isometries can not share exactly one endpoint. Thus c \u00d7 {t0 } and c\u2032 \u00d7 {t1 }\neither do not share any endpoints or have the same endpoints. If they do not share\nany endpoints, then < k, hkh\u22121 > is a free group of rank two. If they have the same\nendpoints, then c\u2032 = c since Y is a tree. In this case both h and k leave the flat c \u00d7 R\ninvariant and < h, k > acts cocompactly on c \u00d7 R and therefore contains generic\nelements.\nLemma 7.5. Let h, k \u2208 H be two special elements. If dT (h(+\u221e), k(+\u221e)) = \u03c0/2,\ndT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2, then H either is virtually free abelian or contains a free\ngroup of rank two.\nProof. If {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {h(k(+\u221e)), h(k(\u2212\u221e))} =\n6 \u03c6, then either there is some\nn\nn \u2208 {1, 2, 3} so that h fixes one of k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e), or the two sets {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}\nand {h2 (k(+\u221e)), h2(k(\u2212\u221e))} are disjoint. In the former case the lemma follows from\nLemma 7.4.\nNow we may assume {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {hi (k(+\u221e)), hi (k(\u2212\u221e))} = \u03c6 for i = 1\nor 2. It follows from Lemma 7.3 that < k, hi kh\u2212i > contains a free group of rank two\nsince dT (h(+\u221e), \u03be) = \u03c0/2 for any \u03be \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e), hi (k(+\u221e)), hi (k(\u2212\u221e))}.\nLemma 7.6. If {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} 6= \u03c6 for any two special elements h, k \u2208 H, then H is virtually infinite cyclic.\nProof. Let k \u2208 H be a fixed special element. Then for any h \u2208 H, hkh\u22121 is also a\nspecial element. The assumption implies that the axes of k and hkh\u22121 are parallel.\nThus h(Pk ) = Phkh\u22121 = Pk for any h \u2208 H. Pk splits as Y \u00d7 R where Y is a tree. After\npassing to an index two subgroup if necessary, each h \u2208 H acts on Pk = Y \u00d7 R as\nh = (h\u2032 , T ) where h\u2032 is an isometry of Y and T is a translation on R. Then h \u2192 T\ndefines a homomorphism from H onto an infinite cyclic group. We notice the image\nof the homomorphism is indeed infinite cyclic since H is a group of cellular isometries.\nLet H0 be the kernel of this homomorphism. There is no hyperbolic isometry in H0\nsince any hyperbolic isometry in H0 is special and the assumption implies its axes\nshould be parallel to {y} \u00d7 R. So H0 is a torsion group acting properly on the tree\nY . It follows that H0 is a finite group.\n\n\f28\n\nXiangdong Xie\n\nProof of Proposition 7.2. Since M \u2229 \u2202T Ph0 contains a regular point, Theorem 2.2\nand Proposition 4.7 imply that M \u2229 \u2202T Ph contains a regular point for any special\nelement h \u2208 H. By Lemma 7.6 we may assume there are special elements h, k \u2208 H\nwith {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6. Let m \u2208 M \u2229 \u2202T Pk be a regular\npoint. By replacing k with k \u22121 if necessary we may assume dT (m, k(+\u221e)) < \u03c0/2.\nLet s \u2208 \u2202T Pk be the unique singular point in the interior of mk(\u2212\u221e).\nNotice dT (m, h(+\u221e)), dT (m, h(\u2212\u221e)) < \u03c0 and recall a branch point in \u2202T X is\na singular point. First suppose the intersection mh(+\u221e) \u2229 mh(\u2212\u221e) is a nontrivial\nsegment. Then mh(+\u221e)\u2229mh(\u2212\u221e) = ms or mk(+\u221e). If mh(+\u221e)\u2229mh(\u2212\u221e) = ms,\nthen dT (s, \u03be) = \u03c0/2 for any \u03be \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e), k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}. In this case the\nproposition follows from Lemma 7.3. If mh(+\u221e) \u2229 mh(\u2212\u221e) = mk(+\u221e), then\ndT (k(+\u221e), h(+\u221e)) = dT (k(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2 and the proposition follows from\nLemma 7.5.\nNow suppose mh(+\u221e) \u2229 mh(\u2212\u221e) = {m}. In this case, h(+\u221e)m \u222a mh(\u2212\u221e)\nis a geodesic between two singular points and so has length an integral multiple of\n\u03c0/2. Since dT (m, h(+\u221e)), dT (m, h(\u2212\u221e)) < \u03c0, the length of h(+\u221e)m \u222a mh(\u2212\u221e)\nis either \u03c0 or 1.5\u03c0. The length of h(+\u221e)m \u222a mh(\u2212\u221e) can not be 1.5\u03c0 since\ndT (h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0 and there is no simple closed geodesic with length 2.5\u03c0\nin \u2202T X. Therefore the length of h(+\u221e)m \u222a mh(\u2212\u221e) is \u03c0. It follows that either\ns \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} or k(+\u221e) \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}. The choice of h, k implies\ns \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)}. Since dT (s, k(+\u221e)) = dT (s, k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2, the proposition\nfollows from Lemma 7.5.\n\n7.2\n\nWhen the Minimal Set Contains Singular Points\n\nIn this section we prove Theorem 7.1 when M contains singular points:\nProposition 7.7. Theorem 7.1 holds if there exists a special element h0 \u2208 H such\nthat M \u2229 \u2202T Ph0 contains a singular point.\nNotice Theorem 7.1 follows from Propositions 7.2 and 7.7. Also recall Lemmas\n7.3, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 are still valid.\nLemma 7.8. If for any special h \u2208 H, M \u2229 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6, then H either is\nvirtually free abelian or contains a free group of rank two.\nProof. By Lemma 7.6 we may assume there are two special elements h, k \u2208 H with\n{h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6.\nLet m \u2208 M \u2229 \u2202T Ph0 be a singular point, and g \u2208 H be an arbitrary special\nelement. Then dT (m, g(+\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0, dT (m, g(\u2212\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0. The assumption implies\ndT (m, g(+\u221e)) \u2265 \u03c0/2, dT (m, g(\u2212\u221e)) \u2265 \u03c0/2. If dT (m, g(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0, then Theorem\n2.2 implies g(+\u221e) is an accumulation point of {g i (m) : i \u2265 1} and thus lies in\n\n\fGroups Acting on CAT (0) Square Complexes\n\n29\n\nM, contradicting to the assumption. Therefore dT (m, g(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2. Similarly\ndT (m, g(+\u221e)) = \u03c0/2.\nNow dT (m, h(+\u221e)) = dT (m, h(\u2212\u221e)) = dT (m, k(+\u221e)) = dT (m, k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2\nand {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6. The lemma follows from Lemma 7.3.\nLemma 7.9. Let h, k \u2208 H be two special elements. If M \u2229 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} =\n6 \u03c6\nand M \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6, then H either is virtually free abelian or contains a\nfree group of rank two.\nProof. We may assume h(+\u221e) \u2208 M. Since M \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6 the proof\nof Lemma 7.8 shows dT (h(+\u221e), k(+\u221e)) = dT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2. The lemma\nnow follows from Lemma 7.5.\n\nProof of Proposition 7.7. Suppose H neither is virtually free abelian nor contains\na free group of rank two. By Lemma 7.6 there are two special elements h, k \u2208 H\nwith {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} = \u03c6. Lemmas 7.8 and 7.9 imply that\nM \u2229 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} =\n6 \u03c6 and M \u2229 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} =\n6 \u03c6.\nWe first claim {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2282 M. Suppose the claim is false. After possibly\nreplacing h and k with their inverses we may assume h(\u2212\u221e) \u2208 M, h(+\u221e) \u2208\n/ M\nand k(\u2212\u221e) \u2208 M. We observe dT (h(\u2212\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2 otherwise h(+\u221e) would\nbe an accumulation point of {hi (k(\u2212\u221e)) : i \u2265 1} and thus lie in M. Notice\ndT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) \u2264 \u03c0. If dT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0 and \u03c3 is a minimal geodesic\nfrom h(+\u221e) to k(\u2212\u221e), then \u03c3 \u222a k(\u2212\u221e)h(\u2212\u221e) is a geodesic from h(+\u221e) to h(\u2212\u221e)\nwith length 1.5\u03c0. It follows that there is a simple closed geodesic with length 2.5\u03c0\nin \u2202T X (as dT (h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0), a contradiction. If dT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2,\nthen we have dT (h(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = dT (h(\u2212\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2 and by Lemma 7.5\nH either is virtually free abelian or contains a free group of rank two.\nThus {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} \u2282 M, and similarly {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} \u2282 M. By assumption we have dT (\u03be, \u03b7) \u2264 \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} and \u03b7 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}.\nIf dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0 for any \u03be \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} and any \u03b7 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)}, then\n< h, k > contains a free group of rank two. Therefore we may assume there are\n\u03be \u2208 {h(+\u221e), h(\u2212\u221e)} and \u03b7 \u2208 {k(+\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)} with dT (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03c0/2. Without\nloss of generality we assume dT (h(\u2212\u221e), k(\u2212\u221e)) = \u03c0/2. Then the argument in the\npreceding paragraph finishes the proof.\n\nReferences\n[AB] S. Adams, W.
