His work was inspired by the analogies between the physics of\nelectrons in a strong magnetic field and the properties of D branes in string theory [4]. In\nhis argument, Susskind derived the semiclassical theory of the incompressible fluids in a\nmagnetic field and showed that it corresponds to the non-commutative theory in the limit\nof small \u03b8 (high density); then, he proposed the fully quantum, non-commutative theory\nfor the Laughlin Hall states made of discrete electrons.\nSeveral authors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have then addressed the question whether the\nnon-commutative Chern-Simons theory really realizes the Laughlin wave functions and\nthe physics of anyons [12]. If the answer is positive, this theory would provide a promising approach for understanding the open issues of the quantum Hall effect, in the form\nof an \"effective non-relativistic theory\". Moreover, it would offer an interesting physical\nrealization of the new mathematical structures of non-commutative field theory [13] and\nnon-commutative geometry [14].\nEffective field theory descriptions of the quantum Hall effect has been extensively developed in the past years using ordinary Chern-Simons theories [15], that correspond to\nconformal field theories of the low-energy excitations at the edge of the sample [16].\nThese approaches have been rather successful and have been experimentally confirmed\n[17]. However, they present some limitations, such as the need of several conformal theories to describe the whole set of observed Hall plateaus and the presence of slightly different\nproposals [16][18] for describing the less understood Jain plateaus [19]. Moreover, these\neffective descriptions do not incorporate the microscopic physics to understand the \"universality\" of the Laughlin wave function [20], the Jain \"composite fermion\" transformation2\n[19] and the phase transitions between plateaus [22]. The non-commutative Chern-Simons\ntheory, if appropriate, could tackle these problems being actually non-relativistic, while the\nmethods of non-commutative geometry could provide new theoretical tools.\nSusskind's proposal was analysed by Polychronakos [5, 6], who introduced a finitedimensional regularization of the non-commutative Chern-Simons theory, the so-called\nChern-Simons matrix model or, more precisely, matrix quantum mechanics. This theory is\nsuitable for describing finite systems, that expose the relevant boundary excitations; on the\nother hand, the original field theory of infinite fluids is a topological theory that is not fully\ndefined without specifying the ultraviolet (and infrared) regularizations.\n2 See\n\nthe Refs. [21] for the theories of composite fermions.\n\n1\n\n\fFurthermore, Polychronakos showed that the matrix model possesses a U(N) gauge symmetry, where N is the size of the matrices, and that it can be reduced to 2N physical degrees\nof freedom living on a two-dimensional phase space. The resulting reduced theory is the\nCalogero model of one-dimensional non-relativistic fermions with repulsive interaction.\nThis model has many features in common with the Laughlin theory in the lowest Landau\nlevel, but is not equivalent. More precisely, the two quantum problems have isomorphic\nset of states but different measures of integration, that are real one-dimensional and complex two-dimensional, respectively. On the other hand, the classical solutions of the noncommutative theory present the expected features of the incompressible Hall fluid and its\nvortex excitations with fractional charge. The expected Hall conductivity was also derived\nin Ref.[10].\nKarabali and Sakita [8] analysed the reduction of the matrix theory to the complex eigenvalues using the coherent states of the electrons in the lowest Landau (Bargmann-Fock\nspace). They could not disentangle the electron coordinates (the complex eigenvalues)\nfrom the auxiliary variables of the boundary fields, but could perform some explicit calculations for low N. They found that the overlaps of states contain the Laughlin wave function\ntogether with a non trivial measure of integration that modifies the properties of the incompressible fluid at short distances. These authors concluded that either the matrix model does\nnot describe the Laughlin physics at all, or it does it in another, unknown set of variables\nthat is hard to find in general.\nIn this paper, we shall analyse the relation of the Chern-Simons matrix model with the\nLaughlin Hall states along similar lines. Using a canonical change of matrix variables, we\nsolve the Gauss law constraint and reduce the theory to the physical degrees of freedom\nthat are the complex eigenvalues and their canonical conjugate momenta. Thus, the path\nintegral of the matrix theory becomes the holomorphic path integral of the lowest Landau\nlevel and the eigenvalues can be interpreted as electron coordinates. The states expressed\nin terms of the complex eigenvalues display the Laughlin wave function, while the overlap\nintegrals are again different from the expected form. The latter fact can be explained as\nfollows.\nIn the reduced variables, we find that the derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives, similar to those caused by an ordinary Chern-Simons interaction that is solved instantaneously in terms of the sources (the so-called statistical interaction [12]). Therefore,\na kind of statistical interaction is present among the electrons (yet keeping their fermion\nstatistics). In the Bargmann space, the derivatives correspond to the conjugate variables,\nthus the statistical interaction modifies the rule of conjugation and leads to non-standard\nexpressions for the overlap integrals.\n\n2\n\n\fThe statistical interaction is actually necessary for the stability of the Laughlin ground\nstate: upon acting with the covariant derivatives, it is not possible to create an excitation\nwith energy and angular momentum lower than those of the Laughlin state. Since a reduction of angular momentum amounts to a compression of the fluid, energy stability also\ncorresponds to incompressibility of the quantum Hall fluid.\nThe incompressibility of the ground state can be described by the highest-weight conditions for a representation of the (non-relativistic) W\u221e algebra of quantum area-preserving\ndiffeomorphisms [23]: actually, this symmetry characterizes the quantum Hall fluids and\ntheir excitations [24]. We thus analyse the realization of the W\u221e algebra in the ChernSimons matrix model, both in the original and the reduced variables, and prove the highestweight conditions satisfied by the ground state using the covariant derivatives. However,\nin this paper we cannot derive the complete representation of the W\u221e algebra, owing to\nnormal-ordering and finite-size problems. We remark that the state overlaps can be expressed as commutators of the W\u221e algebra, such that the W\u221e symmetry, once fully understood, can provide a complete algebraic characterization of the Laughlin incompressible\nfluids that is independent of the choice of coordinates.\nIn conclusion, the Chern-Simons matrix model exactly describes the Laughlin Hall states\nif it realizes the W\u221e symmetry. Although we cannot presently prove this, we believe that\nour results are rather positive and worth discussing.\nThe plan of the paper is the following: in section two, we recall the Susskind approach,\nthe Polychronakos matrix model and the relation with the Calogero model. In section three,\nwe discuss the holomorphic quantization of the matrix model, solve the Gauss law and\nobtain the Laughlin wave function of the complex eigenvalues. In section four, we discuss\nthe realization of the W\u221e symmetry in the matrix model, its relation with the ground state\nstability and the physical interpretation of the incompressible Hall fluids. In section five,\nwe perform the reduction to the eigenvalues of the path integral and the state overlaps,\nand obtain the dynamics of electrons in the lowest Landau level. The same analysis in the\ncase of real quantization yields the path integral of the Calogero model. In section six, we\ndiscuss our results and suggest some developments.\n\n2 Non-commutative Chern-Simons theory, Chern-Simons\nmatrix model and Calogero model\nThe quantization of non-commutative field theories and especially of the topological ChernSimons theory presents several subtle technical aspects, that sometimes have led to incon3\n\n\fsistencies in the literature. Thus, we want to describe our approach as clearly as possible,\nand start with a short but self-contained introduction to Susskind's derivation [1] and the\ndevelopments by Polychronakos and other authors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nLet us begin with N first-quantized electrons with two-dimensional coordinates X\u03b1a (t),\na = 1, 2, \u03b1 = 1, . . ., N, subjected to a strong magnetic field B such that their action can be\nprojected to the lowest Landau level [25],\neB\nS =\n2\n\nZ\n\nN\n\ndt\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u03b5ab X\u03b1a \u1e8a\u03b1b .\n\n(2.1)\n\nSusskind considered the limit of the continuous fluid [1]:\n~X\u03b1 (t) \u2192 ~X(~x,t) ,\n\n~X (~x,t = 0) = ~x ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere ~x are the coordinates of an initial, reference configuration of the fluid. The resulting\nfluid mechanics is in the Lagrangian formulation, because the field ~X follows the motion of\nthe fluid [9]. For incompressible fluids, the constraint of constant density, \u03c1(~x) = \u03c1o , can\nbe written in terms of Poisson brackets {*, *} of the ~x coordinate as follows:\n\u03c1o = \u03c1(~x) = \u03c1o\n\n\u2202~X\n\u2202~x\n\n=\n\n\u03c1o\n\u03b5ab {X a, X b } .\n2\n\nThis constraint can be added to the action by using the Lagrange multiplier A0 ,\nZ\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\neB\u03c1o\nS =\ndt d 2 x \u03b5ab X a \u1e8a b \u2212 \u03b8{X b , A0 } + 2\u03b8 A0 ;\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\nin this equation, we introduced the constant \u03b8,\n\u03b8 =\n\n1\n,\n2\u03c0\u03c1o\n\n(2.5)\n\nthat will later parametrize the non-commutativity.\nThe action (2.4) is left invariant by reparametrizations of the ~x variable with unit Jacobian, the area-preserving diffeomorphism, also called w\u221e transformations [23][24]: they\ncorrespond to changes of the original labels of the fluid at t = 0 (cf. Eq.(2.2)) [1][9]. The\nw\u221e symmetry can be put into the form of a gauge invariance by introducing the gauge\npotential ~A, as follows:\nX a = xa + \u03b8 \u03b5ab Ab (x) .\n(2.6)\nThe action (2.4) can be rewritten in the Chern-Simons form in terms of the three-dimensional\ngauge field A\u03bc = (A0 , Aa ):\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03b8\b\nk\n2\ndt d x \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd A\u03c1 +\nA\u03bc , A\u03bd A\u03c1 .\n(2.7)\nS = \u2212\n4\u03c0\n3\n4\n\n\fThe coupling constant k parametrizes the filling fraction of this (semi)classical fluid:\n\u03bd(cl) =\n\n1\n1\n2\u03c0\u03c1o\n=\n= .\neB\neB\u03b8\nk\n\n(2.8)\n\nAfter the analysis of Lagrangian incompressible fluids, Susskind made a proposal for the\ncomplete theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect, that could hold beyond the continuous fluid approximation by accounting for the granularity of the electrons. He suggested to\nreplace the theory (2.7) with the non-commutative (Abelian) Chern-Simons theory [13],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n2i\nk\n2\ndt d x \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u22c6 A\u03c1 \u2212 A\u03bc \u22c6 A\u03bd \u22c6 A\u03c1 ,\nSNCCS = \u2212\n(2.9)\n4\u03c0\n3\nwhere the Moyal star product is:\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 \u2202\n\u03b8\n(g \u22c6 f ) (x) = exp i \u03b5ab a b\n2\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2\n\n\u0013\n\nf (x1 ) g(x2 )\n\n.\n\n(2.10)\n\nx1 =x2 =x\n\nActually, the two actions (2.9) and (2.7) agree to leading order in \u03b8, i.e. for dense fluids. In\nthe new action (2.9), the gauge fields with Moyal product have become Wigner functions\nof the non-commuting operators, xb1 , xb2 , the former spatial coordinates [14]:\n[b\nx1 , xb2 ] = x1 \u22c6 x2 \u2212 x2 \u22c6 x1 = i \u03b8 .\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe corresponding quantization of the area can be thought of as a discretization of the fluid\n(at the classical level), with the minimal area \u03b8 allocated to a single electron [1]. Other\nmotivations for this proposal were found in the study of D-branes dynamics [4].\nAny non-commutative field theory corresponds to a theory of infinite-dimensional matrices, that represent the commutator [b\nx1 , xb2 ] = i \u03b8. The general map can be found in Ref.[13],\nwhile the specific case of the Chern-Simons theory has been discussed e.g. in Ref.[4]. The\nmatrix theory equivalent to (2.9) is the Chern-Simons matrix quantum mechanics (ChernSimons matrix model) with action:\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\nZ\nb\neB\nb\na\nb0 ] + 2\u03b8 A\nb0 .\n(2.12)\ndt Tr \u03b5ab Xb X\u1e03 + i[Xb , A\nSCSMM =\n2\n\nb0 yields the Gauss-law constraint,\nThe variation of this action with respect to A\n[Xb 1 , Xb2 ] = i\u03b8 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nthat can actually be solved in terms of infinite-dimensional Hermitean matrices Xb a (and\nb0 ). The previous relation (2.6) between the gauge field Aa and the coordinates X a still\nthus A\nholds for the hatted matrix variables: upon substituting it in the matrix action (2.12), one\n5\n\n\frecovers the non-commutative theory (2.9) [4]. Let us finally note that the correspondences\nbetween the matrix (2.12) and original (2.9) theories.\nSusskind proposal has been analyzed by many authors that found several evidences of\nquantum Hall physics, both at the classical and at the quantum level. However, there remain\nsome open problems; two of them will be particularly important for our discussion:\n\u2022 In the extension from the fluid (2.4) to the non-commutative theory (2.12), the electron coordinates ~X become matrices and loose their physical interpretation. There is\nthe question of defining the physical (gauge-invariant) observables in the matrix theory that correspond to the electron coordinates, the density \u03c1(~x) and other quantities.\nThis issue has been addressed in the Refs.[8][10].\n\u2022 The Gauss law (2.13) admits one solution modulo reparametrizations, therefore the\nmatrix theory (2.12) possesses just one state, i.e. the ground state of an infinitely extended incompressible fluid with infinite electrons. This is a topological theory with\nrather peculiar quantum properties: for example, the number and type of physical\ndegrees of freedom may depend on the regularization and the boundary conditions;\nthey should suitably chosen for the complete definition of the theory.\nAn answer to the second question was given by Polychronakos [5] who regularized the matrix model by introducing a \"boundary\" vector field \u03c8i , i = 1, . . . , N, such that the modified\nGauss law admits finite-dimensional matrix solutions. The modified action is:\nZ\ni\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\nB\ndt Tr \u03b5ab X a \u1e8a b \u2212 i[A0 , X b ] + 2\u03b8 A0 \u2212 \u03c9 (X a )2\nSCSMM =\n2 Z\n\u2212\n\ndt \u03c8\u2020 (i\u03c8\u0307 + A0 \u03c8) .\n\n(2.14)\n\nIn this equation, we suppressed the hats over the matrices, set e = 1 and also introduced a\nquadratic potential with coupling \u03c9. The Gauss law now reads:\nG = 0,\n\nG = \u2212iB [X1 , X2 ] \u2212 B\u03b8 + \u03c8\u03c8\u2020 .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe condition Tr G = 0 can be satisfied by N \u00d7 N-dimensional matrices X a, provided that\nk\u03c8k2 = NB\u03b8. This reduction to a finite-dimensional quantum mechanical problem introduces both an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff in the theory. As shown in Ref.[5], one\ncan choose a gauge in which \u03c8i has only one non-vanishing component, say the N-th one,\nresulting into a boundary effect that disappears for large N upon defining a suitable weak\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e. The U (N) symmetry of the matrix Chern-Simons theory (2.14) is given by\nX a \u2192 U X aU \u2020 and \u03c8 \u2192 U \u03c8, where U is a unitary matrix. Since G is the generator of infinitesimal transformations at the quantum level, the Gauss-law condition requires that all\nphysical states should be U (N) singlets [5, 1].\n6\n\n\fClassical matrix solutions of this theory were found in Ref.[5] for the ground state and\nthe quasi-hole excitation that possess the expected features of Hall incompressible fluids.\nThe distribution of the matrix eigenvalues for the ground state in the isotropic potential\n\u03c9Tr~X 2 is a circular droplet with uniform density \u03c1o \u223c 1/2\u03c0\u03b8 for large N, as in the infinite\ntheory. In the quasi-hole solution, a hole (vortex) is present in the density with the correct\nsize. These solutions suggest the identification of the matrix eigenvalues with the electron\ncoordinates: however, only one matrix can be diagonalized, say (X 1 )nm = x1n \u03b4nm , and their\ndistribution \u03c1(x1 ) is actually meant to be integrated over the other coordinate x2 .\n\n2.1 Quantization on the real line\nThe quantization of Polychronakos' theory (2.14) can be done before or after having solved\nthe Gauss constraint: both approaches have been considered in Ref.[5] and we discuss the\nlatter first. Since the Hermitean matrix X 1 can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation,\nwe can fix the gauge:\n(X 1)nm = xn \u03b4nm .\n(2.16)\nThe form of the other variables is obtained by solving the Gauss constraint (2.15) in this\ngauge. The result is:\n\u221a\nB\u03b8 ,\n\u2200n,\n\u03c8n =\n1 \u2212 \u03b4nm\n(X 2)nm = yn \u03b4nm \u2212 i\u03b8\n;\n(2.17)\nxn \u2212 xm\nthese two equations follow from the diagonal and off-diagonal components of Gnm = 0,\nrespectively; in the diagonal components, we used the residual U (1)N gauge symmetry to\nfix the phases of \u03c8n . The variables yn in (2.17) parametrize the components of X2 that are\nleft undetermined. The substitution of all variables back into the action yields:\nS = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nN\n\ndt B\n\n\u2211\n\n\u1e8bn yn + H ,\n\nn=1\n\nB\u03c9 ~ 2\nH =\nTr X =\n2\n\nN\n\n\u2211\n\nn=1\n\n\u0012\n\nB\u03c9 2\n\u03c9 p2n\n+\nx\nB 2\n2 n\n\n\u0013\n\nN\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nn6=m\n\n1\n\u03c9B\u03b82\n.\n2 (xn \u2212 xm )2\n\n(2.18)\n\nNamely, the interpretation of the N real variables xn as particle coordinates has led to the\nidentification of the conjugate momenta pn = \u2212Byn . Moreover, the Hamiltonian is found\nto be that of the Calogero model with coupling constant B\u03b8 = k taking integer values3.\nTherefore, the Chern-Simons matrix model has been reduced to the quantum mechanics of\n3\n\nThe quantization of the Chern-Simons coupling k follows from the requirement of invariance of the\naction (2.9) under large gauge transformation [26].\n\n7\n\n\fN particles on the line with two-body repulsion. Note the reduction of degrees of freedom:\nstarting from the 2N 2 + 2N real phase-space variables (X1, X2 , \u03c8, \u03c8\u2020 ), the gauge fixings\neliminate N 2 variables and the Hermitean constraint G \u2261 0 further N 2 ones, leaving the\nconjugate variables of N particles.\nThe one-dimensional Calogero model is closely related to the theory of two-dimensional\nelectrons quantized in the first Laudau level: it is integrable and the space of states is known\n[27] and isomorphic to that of the excitations over the Laughlin state at filling fraction\n\u03bd = 1/(k + 1) [2]; the Calogero particles satisfy selection rules of an enhanced exclusion\nprinciple [28] that allow to define a one-dimensional analog of the fractional statistics of\nanyons [12]. On the other hand, the Hilbert spaces of the two problems are different,\nbecause the one-dimensional norm of the Calogero model is different from that of the first\nLandau level [27, 29].\nTherefore, Polychronakos' analysis found strong analogies between the Chern-Simons\nmatrix model and the Laughlin Hall states but not a complete equivalence. In the next\nsection, we shell discuss another quantization scheme and will perform a change of matrix\nvariables that let the electron coordinates and the Laughlin wave function emerge rather\nnaturally.\n\n3 Holomorphic quantization of the Chern-Simons matrix\nmodel\nWe now discuss the \"covariant quantization\" of the Chern-Simons matrix model (2.14): we\nsolve the Gauss-law constraint at the quantum level, elaborating on the results of the Refs.\n[5] [7]. It is convenient to introduce the complex matrices:\nX \u2020 = X1 \u2212 i X2 .\n\nX = X1 + i X2 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe matrix action (2.14) in the A0 = 0 gauge is:\nZ\n\n\u0001\nB\nTr X1 \u1e8a2 \u2212 \u1e8a1 X2 \u2212 i\u03c8\u2020 \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 H (Xa)\n2\nZ\nB\n=\ndt\n\u1e8anm X nm \u2212 i \u2211 \u03c8\u0307n \u03c8n \u2212 H (X \u2020X ) ,\n2i \u2211\nn\nnm\n\nSCSMM |A0 =0 =\n\ndt\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere H = B\u03c9 Tr Xa2 /2. This action implies the following oscillator commutation relations\nbetween the components of the matrices and vectors:\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0003\u0003\n2\n\u03b4nk \u03b4ml ,\nX nm , Xkl\n=\nB\n(3.3)\n[[ \u03c8n , \u03c8m ]] = \u03b4nm .\n8\n\n\fIn these equations, we represented the quantum commutator with double brackets to distinguish it from the classical matrix commutator.\nThe form of the action (3.2) is that of N 2 + N \"particles\" in the lowest Landau level with\ncomplex \"coordinates\" Xnm and \u03c8n , that can be quantized in the Bargmann-Fock space of\nholomorphic wave functions \u03a8(X , \u03c8), with integration measure [30]:\nh\u03a81 |\u03a82 i =\n\nZ\n\nB\n\nD X D X D \u03c8 D \u03c8 e\u2212 2 TrX\n\n\u2020 X\u2212\u03c8\u2020 \u03c8\n\n\u03a81 (X , \u03c8) \u03a82 (X , \u03c8) .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe conjugate variables act as derivative operators on the wave functions,\nX nm \u2192\n\n2 \u2202\n,\nB \u2202Xnm\n\n\u03c8n \u2192\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\u03c8n\n\n(3.5)\n\nand the (properly normal-ordered) Gauss law (2.15) becomes a differential equation for the\nwave functions of physical states (B\u03b8 = k):\nGi j \u03a8phys (X , \u03c8) = 0 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 Xl j\n\u2212 k \u03b4i j + \u03c8i\n.\nGi j = \u2211 Xil\n\u2202X jl\n\u2202Xli\n\u2202\u03c8 j\nl\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe now come to a crucial point of our analysis: we are going to perform a change of\nmatrix variables that leaves invariant the commutation relations (3.3). This B\u00e4cklund (or\nBogoliubov) transformation is defined as follows:\nX = V \u22121 \u039b V ,\n\u03c8 = V\n\n\u22121\n\n\u039b = diag(\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbN ) ,\n\n\u03c6.\n\n(3.7)\n\nHere we used the fact that a complex matrix can be diagonalized by a GL(N, C) transformation (up to the zero-measure set of matrices with degenerate eigenvalues). For the\ntransformation of the derivative operators (3.5), we should consider the linear transformation in the N 2 + N dimensional tangent space:\n\b\n{dXnm , d\u03c8n } \u2192 d\u03bbn , dvi j (i 6= j) , d\u03c6n ,\ndv = dV V \u22121 .\n(3.8)\nFrom the transformation of the covariant vector {dXnm , d\u03c8n },\ndX = V \u22121 (d\u039b + [\u039b, dv])V ,\nd\u03c8 = V \u22121 (d\u03c6 \u2212 dv \u03c6) ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwe can compute the inverse transformation of the contravariant vector {\u2202/\u2202Xnm , \u2202/\u2202\u03c8n }.\nThe result is the following:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1 \u2212 \u03b4nm\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u22121 \u2202\n= Vni V jm\n,\n=\n\u03b4nm +\n+ \u03c6m\n,\n\u2202Xi j\n\u2202\u039bnm\n\u2202\u039bnm\n\u2202\u03bbn\n\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bbm \u2202vnm\n\u2202\u03c6n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= Vn j\n.\n(3.10)\n\u2202\u03c8 j\n\u2202\u03c6n\n9\n\n\fThis transformation is invertible for detV 6= 0 and distinct eigenvalues \u03bbn 6= \u03bbm . One can\nexplicitly check that the commutation relations (3.3) are left invariant by the transformation, namely that each new variable (\u03bb,V, \u03c6) satisfies canonical commutators with the corresponding derivative4.\nThe oscillator vacuum state is left invariant by the transformation (3.7): indeed, the vac(new)\n(old)\nuum wave functions for the original and new oscillators, \u03a8o = 1 and \u03a8o , respectively,\nshould satisfy:\n\u2202\n(old)\n= 0,\n\u03a8o\n\u2202Xi j\n\u2202\n(new)\n= 0 , i 6= j,\n\u03a8o\n\u2202vi j\n\n\u2202\n(old)\n= 0,\n\u03a8o\n\u2202\u03c8 j\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(new)\n(new)\n=\n= 0.\n\u03a8o\n\u03a8o\n\u2202\u03bb j\n\u2202\u03c6 j\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe comparison of these expressions with the transformation (3.10) shows that it is con(new)\n= 1. This result is at variance with the usual\nsistent to keep the same vacuum: \u03a8o\nBogoliubov transformations, where the new vacuum contains an infinite number of old\nparticles. Therefore, the transformation (3.10) preserves the number operators associated\nto both Xi j and \u03c8i oscillators.\nThe substitution of the new matrix variables (3.7) and derivatives (3.10) in the Gauss law\n(3.6) yields the following result:\n\u22121\nenm ,\nenm \u03a8(\u039b,V, \u03c6) = 0 ,\nGi j = Vim\nVn j G\nG\n\uf8f1\n\u2202\nn 6= m ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212 \u2202vnm\ne\nGnm =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2202\n\u2212 k n=m.\n\u03c6n \u2202\u03c6\nn\n\n(3.12)\n\nRather remarkably, the change of variables diagonalizes the constraint and allows for the\nelimination of the unphysical degrees of freedom:\n\u2022 The N 2 \u2212 N off-diagonal components of V are killed, namely \u03a8(phys) (\u03bb,V, \u03c6) can\nonly depend on V through quantities like detV .\n\u2022 The N degrees of freedom of \u03c8 are also frozen, because all physical wave functions\nshould contain the same homogeneous polynomial of degree k in each component of\nk\nthe vector, which is \u220fN\nn=1 (\u03c6n ) .\nThe remaining dynamical variables are the N complex eigenvalues \u03bbn , that can be interpreted as coordinates of electrons in lowest Landau level.\n4 The\n\ntransformation of the matrix derivative has been suitably normal-ordered in Eq.(3.10).\n\n10\n\n\f3.1 Wave functions\nThe general solution of the Gauss law for the wave functions of physical states in the\n(X , \u03c8) coordinates, Eq. (3.6), has been found in the Refs. [5] [7]: we should form U (N)singlet polynomials made of the N-component epsilon tensor and an arbitrary number of X\nmatrices; moreover, the condition Tr G = 0 in (3.6) implies that the vector \u03c8 should occur\nto the power Nk. For k = 1, these wave functions take the form [7]:\n\u03a8{n1 ,...,nN } (X , \u03c8) = \u03b5i1...iN (X n1 \u03c8)i1 * * * (X nN \u03c8)iN ,\n\n0 \u2264 n1 < n2 < * * * < nN . (3.13)\n\nfor any ordered set of positive integers {ni }. The ground state in the confining potential\nTr(X X \u2020) is given by the closest packing {0, 1, . . ., N \u2212 1} that has the lowest degree in X .\nFor k 6= 1, one can multiply k terms of this sort, leading to \u03a8{n1 ,...,n1 }***{nk ,...,nk } . As shown\nN\nN\n1\n1\nin Ref.[7], there is an equivalent basis for these states that involves the \"bosonic\" powers\nof X :\n\u03a8 (X , \u03c8) =\n\n\u2211\n\n{mk }\n\n\u03a8k\u2212gs\n\nTr (X m1 ) * * * Tr(X mk ) \u03a8k\u2212gs ,\n\nh\n\u0001 ik\n= \u03b5i1...iN \u03c8i1 (X \u03c8)i2 * * * X N\u22121 \u03c8 i\n,\n\n(3.14)\n\nN\n\nwhere the positive integers {m1 , . . . , mk } are now unrestricted. This second basis (3.14)\nalso makes sense in the k = 0 case, where \u03a80\u2212gs = 1.\nLet us now perform the change of matrix variables in the wave functions (3.14): the\nexcitations made by the invariant powers Tr(X r ) became the power sums of the eigenvalues,\n\u2211n \u03bbrn ; in the ground state wave function, the dependence on V and \u03c6 factorizes and the\npowers of the eigenvalues make up the Vandermonde determinant \u2206(\u03bb) = \u220fi< j (\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bb j ):\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 ik\n\u03b5i1...iN V \u22121 \u03c6 i V \u22121 \u039b\u03c6 i * * * V \u22121 \u039bN\u22121 \u03c6 i\nN\n1\n2\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011ik\n= (detV )\u22121 det \u03bbi\u22121\n\u03c6j\nj\n!k\n\n\u03a8k\u2212gs (\u039b,V, \u03c8) =\n\n= (detV )\u2212k\n\n\u220f\n\n1\u2264n<m\u2264N\n\n(\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bbm )k\n\n\u220f \u03c6i\n\n.\n\n(3.15)\n\ni\n\nWe thus obtain the Laughlin wave function for the ground state of the Hall effect with\nthe electron coordinates corresponding to the complex eigenvalues of X . The value of the\nfilling fraction is:\n1\n,\n(3.16)\n\u03bd =\nk+1\nand is renormalized from the classical value (2.8) because the wave function should acquire one extra factor of \u2206(\u03bb) from the integration measure, as shown later. The factorized\n11\n\n\fdependence on V and \u03c8 in (3.15) is the same for all the states (3.14), since it is the unique\nsolution to the Gauss law (3.12); namely, these degrees of freedom are frozen. The bosonic\npower sums \u2211n \u03bbrn are the natural basis of symmetric polynomials forming the excitations\nover the Laughlin state5 .\nTherefore, we have shown that the change of matrix variables (3.7) allows to explicitly\neliminate the gauge degrees of freedom and reduce Chern-Simons matrix model to the\nquantum mechanics of N variables with ground state given by the Laughlin wave function.\nIn the next section, we discuss the meaning of the covariant derivatives (3.10) that have\nemerged in the reduction.\n\n4 Stability, incompressibility and W\u221e symmetry\n4.1 Introduction\nIn a series of papers [24, 31, 32, 18], the incompressible Hall fluids have been characterized by the symmetry under W\u221e transformations, that are the quantization of the \u03c9\u221e\narea-preserving diffeomorphisms of the plane [23]. Actually, the deformations of a classical droplet of fluid of constant density have all the same area and can be mapped one into\nanother by \u03c9\u221e reparametrizations. In the quantum theory of the first Landau level, the \u03bd = 1\nground state is a circular droplet of quantum incompressible fluid that admits the further\ninterpretation of a filled Fermi sea [24]: the electrons occupy all the available one-particle\n\u221a\nstates of angular momentum J = 0, 1, . . ., N \u2212 1, leading to a droplet of radius R \u223c N.\nThe deformations of the droplet are obtained from the W\u221e operators: they are the moments of the generating function of classical \u03c9\u221e transformations that are quantized in the\nBargmann space [24]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\n\u2202 m\nn\n,\n\u03b1 = 1, . . . , N,\n(4.1)\nLnm = \u2211 \u03bb\u03b1\n\u2202\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03b1=1\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, . . . , N is the particle index, \u03bb\u0304 \u2192 \u2202/\u2202\u03bb when acting on holomorphic wave\nfunctions, and n, m are non-negative integers.\nThe W\u221e operators generate small fluctuations of the \u03bd = 1 ground state6 , \u03a6gs = \u2206(\u03bb), that\npossess angular momentum \u2206J = n \u2212 m with respect to the ground state. Excitations with\n5 The counting of these states is given by the number of partitions and it shows the correspondence between\n\nthe edge excitations of incompressible Hall fluids and the states of a one-dimensional bosonic field [16].\n6\nWe use the notation \u03a6 for the wave function of the physical electron variables, to distinguish it from that\nof the matrix model \u03a8 (3.15).\n\n12\n\n\f\u2206J < 0 are forbidden in the filled Fermi sea, because they would correspond to violations\nof the exclusion principle. Therefore, the ground state should satisfy the conditions:\n\nLnm \u03a6gs = 0 ,\n\n0 \u2264 n < m \u2264 N \u22121 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nFurthermore, the generators with m \u2265 N also vanish because they would correspond to\nparticle-hole transitions outside the Fermi sea [24].\nThe N(N \u2212 1)/2 conditions (4.2) express the incompressibility of the \u03bd = 1 quantum\nHall ground state and represent the highest-weight conditions for the representation of the\nW\u221e algebra. In the quadratic confining potential, H = \u2211\u03b1 \u03bb\u0304\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 \u221d J, the incompressibility\nof the ground state is equivalent to its energy stability.\nThe other states in the infinite-dimensional representations are the excitation obtained\nby acting with Lnm , n > m, on the ground state. One can show that these operators generate all the bosonic power sums \u2211\u03b1 \u03bbk\u03b1 described before, such that the Lnm carry over the\nbosonization of the incompressible fluid in the non-relativistic theory7 .\nThe W\u221e algebra is [24]:\nMin(m,k)\n\n[Lnm , Lkl ] =\n\n\u2211\n\ns=1\n\nm! k!\nLn+k\u2212s, m+l\u2212s \u2212 (m \u2194 l , n \u2194 k) .\n(m \u2212 s)! (k \u2212 s)! s!\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe first term in the r.h.s, [Lnm , Lkl ] = ~(mk \u2212 nl)Ln+k\u22121, m+l\u22121 , corresponds to the quantization of the classical algebra w\u221e of area-preserving diffeomorphism, while the other\nterms are quantum corrections O(~ p ), p \u2265 2. Finally, the operator with equal indices, Lnn ,\nare the Casimirs of the representation, e.g. L00 = N, L11 = J. The representations of the\nW\u221e symmetry for N electrons can be related to the representation of the U (N) algebra [23].\nThe W\u221e algebra is also useful for expressing the overlaps of states. Consider two excitations, e.g. Lmn \u03a6gs and Lkl \u03a6gs , for m > n and k > l: thanks to the conjugation rule,\n\u2020\nLnm\n= Lmn ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nand the incompressibility conditions (4.2), the overlap of these two states can be rewritten\nas a commutator:\nhLmn \u03a6gs |Lkl \u03a6gs i = h\u03a6gs | [Lnm , Lkl ] |\u03a6gs i ,\n\nm > n, k > l,\n\n(4.5)\n\nthat can be reduced to the Casimirs of the algebra, if non-vanishing. In particular, one finds\nthat the \u03bd = 1 representation is unitarity, thanks to the positivity of the Casimirs [24].\n7\n\nActually, these operators become the bosonic current and its normal-ordered powers when evaluated in\nthe relativistic effective theory of edge excitations [31].\n\n13\n\n\fIn conclusion, the use of the W\u221e symmetry allows a complete algebraic description of\nthe \u03bd = 1 incompressible quantum Hall fluid and its excitations, that does not rely on the\ncoordinate representation of wave functions and overlaps.\nLet us now review previous analyses of the W\u221e symmetry of the fractional Laughlin\nstates:\n1\n.\n(4.6)\n\u03a6k\u2212gs = \u2206(\u03bb)k+1 ,\n\u03bd=\nk+1\nAs proposed in Ref. [32], one can perform a similarity transformation on the \u03bd = 1 generators, as follows:\n!m\nN\nk\n\u2202\n(k)\n.\n(4.7)\n\u2212 \u2211\n= \u2206(\u03bb)k Lnm \u2206(\u03bb)\u2212k = \u2211 \u03bbn\u03b1\nLnm\n\u2202\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b2,\u03b26=\u03b1 \u03b1\nThese operators are non-singular when acting of the Laughlin wave function and its excitation, obey the same algebra (4.3) and realize exactly the same \u03bd = 1 representation (same\nvalues of the Casimirs); in particular, the incompressibility conditions read again:\n(k)\n\u03a6k\u2212gs = 0 ,\nLnm\n\n0 \u2264 n < m \u2264 N \u22121 .\n\n(4.8)\n\nOne problem of these operators is the Hermiticity relation (4.4), that is not manifestly\nsatisfied and thus the unitarity of the representation is not guaranteed (unless an exotic\nmeasure of integration is introduced [32]). Nevertheless, a couple of remarks are suggested\nby this analysis:\n\u2022 The similarity between Laughlin states of different \u03bd values and the bosonization of\nthe corresponding relativistic theory on the edge [31] indicate that all Laughlin states\nshould realize representations of the W\u221e algebra (4.3).\n\u2022 In the fractional case, the suggested W\u221e generators (4.7) contain covariant derivatives:\nk\n,\n(4.9)\nDz = \u2202z + Az ,\nAz = \u2212 \u2211\nz\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nthat assign a magnetic charge of k fluxes to each electron, the excess magnetic\nfield being B = [Dz , Dz\u0304 ] = k \u03c0 \u2211\u03b2 \u03b42 (z \u2212 \u03bb\u03b2), (Az\u0304 = 0). Therefore, the covariant\nderivatives introduce a \"statistical interaction\" among the electrons [12], given by\nthe Aharonov-Bohm phases between electric and magnetic charges; note, however,\nthat this interaction does not change the statistics of electrons for even integer values\nof k [20].\n\n14\n\n\f4.2\n\nW\u221e symmetry of the Chern-Simons matrix model\n\nIn the Chern-Simons matrix model, we can introduce two types of polynomial generators\nthat generalize (4.1) and are gauge invariant:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nLnm = Tr X n X \u2020m ,\n\nPnm = \u03c8\u2020 X n X \u2020m \u03c8 .\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe second operators can be considered as finite-N corrections to the first ones, because\nthey involve the boundary vectors.\nBoth families of operators satisfy the incompressibility conditions on the matrix ground\nstates (3.14) for all k:\n\nLnm \u03a8k\u2212gs = 0 ,\n\n0\u2264n<m,\n\nPnm \u03a8k\u2212gs = 0 ,\n\n0\u2264n<m.\n\n(4.11)\n\nThe proof is easily obtained in graphical form. Represent the matrices Xi j as oriented\nlinks, the vectors \u03c8i by dots, the epsilon tensor as the N-branching root of a tree, and attach\nthe extrema according to the summations of matrix indices; then, the k = 1 wave function\n\u03a81\u2212gs is represented by a tree with N branches of different lengths ranging from zero to\nN-1. Note that their total length N(N \u2212 1)/2 is the minimal one for having a non-vanishing\nexpression, owing to presence of the epsilon tensor. The Lnm operators, e.g. ,\n\nL12 = Xi j\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202Xik \u2202Xk j\n\n(4.12)\n\nact on \u03a81\u2212gs as follows: the derivative \u2202/\u2202Xi j remove one link in a branch of the tree and\nidentifies the indices (i, j) at the free extrema. Then, the matrices Xinj rejoin the segments\nand form new branches of different lengths or nucleate closed rings; after this cut and paste,\nthe tree is reformed. Under the action of Lnm with n < m, the total length of the branches\nis lower than that of the ground state, thus the expression vanishes. This proves the first\nof Eq. (4.10) for k = 1. For general k, the wave function \u03a8k\u2212gs contains k independent\ntrees. The action of Lnm can cut and paste branches of different trees, but trees cannot be\njoined because the orientation of the lines would be violated. Thus, independent trees are\nreformed and the previous length counting applies again.\nThe action of the Pnm operators, e.g.,\n\nP01 = \u03c8i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202Xi j \u2202\u03c8 j\n\n15\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fis analogous, with the addition that branches can be cut and joined at their end points, and\nterminated at some point. The resulting tree is similarly shortened for n < m.\nTherefore, the incompressibility conditions (4.11) are verified. It is interesting to note\nthe existence of a generalized exclusion principle in the ground state, that actually follows\nfrom the SU (N) singlet condition. The different branches of the tree can be associated to\n\"states\" and there cannot be more than k \"particles\" of the same type in \u03a8k\u2212gs . The W\u221e\ngenerators map branches into branches, i.e. make particle-hole transitions as in the \u03bd = 1\nfilled Fermi sea, some of which are forbidden by the close packing conditions8.\nWe now discuss the algebra of two Lnm operators. Some care should be taken in dealing\nwith objects that are both operator and matrix ordered: in fact, one should abandon the\nconvention of implicitly summing over contiguous matrix indices and leave them explicit.\nThe Lnm commutator reads (the graphical representation is still useful):\n## \u0012 \u0013\n\"\"\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\n\u2202 l\nn \u2194 k, m \u2194 l\n\u2202\nk\nn\n.\n(4.14)\n, X pq\n\u2212\n[[Lnm , Lkl ]] = Xi j\ni \u2194 p, j \u2194 q\n\u2202X i j\n\u2202X pq\nAgain one derivative kills one matrix and identifies its pair of indices: the results is an operator containing (n +k \u2212s) times X and (m +l \u2212s) times \u2202/\u2202X , with s = 1, 2, . . .. Operator\norderings are dealt with as in the case of the \u03bd = 1 W\u221e algebra (4.3) and they create further terms with s \u2265 1. However, the matrix summations in the resulting operators may not\np q\n\u2020\nbe properly ordered for identifying them as Ln+k\u2212s,m+l\u2212s ; an example is, Xi j Xkl X jk\nXli\u2020 .\nHere we can use the Gauss law to perform the matrix reorderings because it is an identity in gauge invariant expressions: from Eq. (3.6), we read that the reordering of the\npair Xl j Xil\u2020 \u2192 Xil Xl\u2020j creates the extra terms k\u03b4i j and \u03c8i \u03c8\u2020j , leading to the descendants\nLn+k\u2212s,m+l\u2212s and the operators Pn+k\u2212s,m+l\u2212s , with s > 1.\nTherefore, the r.h.s. of the Lnm algebra (4.14) contains the characteristic leading O(~)\nterm for the semiclassical interpretation, but also involves the finite-N descendants Pn\u2212s,m\u2212s ,\ni.e. it does not close. Presumably, for N \u2192 \u221e the latter terms can be disregarded and the\nalgebra closes as in the \u03bd = 1 case (4.3), up to possible redefinitions of the higher, nonclassical structure constants. For finite N, there remain the open problem of selecting the\nright basis,\nLenm = Lnm + \u03b31 Pn\u22121,m\u22121 + \u03b32 Pn\u22122,m\u22122 + * * * ,\n(4.15)\nthat form a closed algebra. The incompressibility conditions (4.11) are satisfied anyhow.\nThis solution of the matrix ordering is also important for identifying physical quantities\nenm [10].\nlike the one-particle density, that is the generating function of L\n8 The\n\nuse of SU(N) singlets for building states with exclusion statistics was also proposed in Ref.[33].\n\n16\n\n\fIn conclusion, we have shown that the Chern-Simons matrix model realizes highestweight representations of the type occurring in the quantum Hall effect, but we cannot\npresently account for the complete form of the W\u221e algebra.\n\n4.3 W\u221e symmetry in physical coordinates\nThe realization of the symmetry in the electron coordinates is more interesting because\nit has direct physical interpretation in the quantum Hall effect. The form of the W\u221e generators is obtained by replacing the canonical transformations (3.7,3.10) into the matrix\nexpressions (4.10):\n(k)\n=\nLnm\n\nN\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03bbnj Dmjj ,\n\nD pq = \u03b4 pq\n\nj=1\n(k)\n=\nPnm\n\nN\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03c6i \u03bbni Dm\nij\n\ni, j=1\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202\u03c6 j\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b4 pq\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u03c6p\n,\n\u2202\u03bb p\n\u03bb p \u2212 \u03bbq\n\u2202\u03c6q\n(4.16)\n\nThe matrix covariant derivative Di j enforces a kind of statistical interaction among the electrons similar to the one discussed in section 4.1. The form of Di j is obtained from (3.10),\nby suppressing the V dependence absent in physical states, but leaving the \u03c6i derivatives\nto allow for possible normal orderings: one should eventually replace \u03c6i \u2202/\u2202\u03c6i \u2192 k, \u2200i. In\nwriting the expressions (4.16), we neglected further operator ordering problems, that are\nnot well defined anyhow for non-linear transformations. Therefore, the present operators\nare not guaranteed to satisfy the W\u221e highest weight conditions of the previous section that\nshould be checked again. Here, we cannot provide a general argument, but shall present\nsome sample calculations that have been done for N = 3, 4, 5, k = 1, . . . , 8 and low values\nof the (n, m) indices with the help of computer algebra.\nThe check of the incompressibility conditions (4.8) on the shifted Laughlin wave function (4.6) gives the following results:\n(k)\n\u03a6k\u2212gs = 0 ,\nLnm\n\nfor 0 \u2264 n < m = 1, 2 ,\n\n(4.17)\n\nwith\n(k)\nLn1\n=\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2211 \u03bbni \u2202\u03bbi ,\ni\n\n(k)\nLn2\n=\n\n\u2211 \u03bbni\ni\n\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03bb2i\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2211\n\nk2 + k\n\nn,n6=i (\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bbi )\n\n2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4.18)\n\nWe see that the covariant derivatives are already effective for stabilizing the incompressible\nfluid at second order. Note the similarities, but also the differences, of the covariant derivatives (4.18) and (4.7), in the present and earlier proposals [32] of W\u221e generators at fractional\n17\n\n\ffilling. In the eigenvalue representation, both the operators and the wave functions depend\nexplicitly on k: this allows us to check the alleged shift k \u2192 k + 1 in \u03a6k\u2212gs = \u2206(\u03bb)k+1 .\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nNext, the operators L03 and P01 \u223c L01 also annihilates the ground state. For higher\nindices, the incompressibility conditions are only satisfied by specific superpositions of the\ntwo kinds of operators (4.16). For example, we have checked those of:\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nLe13\n= L13 + \u03b3 P02 ,\n\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nLe23\n= L13 + \u03c3 P12 ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere \u03b3(k), \u03c3(k) have a non-trivial dependence on k but are independent of N (as they\nshould):\nk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n14 15 33 91 .\n(4.20)\n\u03b3 14 1 15\n8\n5\n4\n7\n16\n15\n1\n\u03c3 2 2 4\nThe general pattern that emerges from these examples is that the incompressibility con(k)\nditions in physical coordinates are satisfied by specific linear combinations of the Lnm\n(k)\noperators and their finite-N descendants Pn\u2212s,m\u2212s (that are missing or are too simple in the\ncases (4.17). We guess that the same combinations also obey a closed W\u221e algebra.\nIn conclusion, we have seen that the W\u221e generators express the stability (incompressibility) of the Laughlin ground state in Chern-Simons matrix model, both in the gauge-invariant\nand gauge-fixed forms. In the latter case, the covariant derivatives are instrumental for this\nresult and express a form of statistical interaction.\n\n5 Path integral and integration measure\n5.1 Real quantization\nIn this section we perform the reduction to the physical degrees of freedom both in the path\nintegral and the state overlaps. We start by discussing the real case leading to the Calogero\nmodel, basically repeating the analysis in Ref. [34].\nThe path integral of the Chern-Simons matrix model is:\nh f |ii =\n\nZ\n\nD X1 (t) D X2 (t) D \u03c8(t) D \u03c8(t)\n\u00d7 exp\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndt \u2212i B Tr(X2 \u1e8a1 ) + \u03c8\u2020 \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 iH\n18\n\n\u220f \u03b4(G(t)) FP ,\nt\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fwhere G is the Gauss-law condition (2.15) and FP is the Faddeed-Popov term for the gauge\nfixing (2.16) reducing X1 to its eigenvalues. Such gauge fixing can be written in the path\nintegral as follows,\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b4 (\u03c7) = \u220f \u03b4 Xi j =\nD \u039b \u220f \u03b4 Xi1j \u2212 \u039bi j ,\n(5.2)\ni6= j\n\nij\n\nwhere \u039b = diag(x1 , . . . , xN ) is a real diagonal matrix. The corresponding Faddeev-Popov\nterm is:\n\u0012 U\u0013\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2020\nU\n=\nDU D \u039b \u03b4 U X1U \u2212 \u039b \u2206(x)2 . (5.3)\n1 = FP = DU \u03b4 \u03c7 det\n\u2202\u03c9\n\nIn this expression, DU is the U (N) Haar measure, d\u03c9 = U \u2020dU and the Faddeev-Popov\ndeterminant is easily computed to be the square of the Vandermonde. Upon inserting (5.3)\nin the path integral and performing the gauge transformation, X1 = U \u039bU \u2020 , X2 = U Xe2U \u2020 ,\n\u03c8 = U \u03c6, the Gauss constraint can be rewritten:\n\u0011 i\nh \u0010 h\ni\n\u03b4 (G) = \u03b4 U B \u039b, Xe2 \u2212 i k I + i \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8\u2020 U \u2020\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c6i \u03c6\u2020j\ni\n1\n\u2020\ne\n\u03b4\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u2212\nk\n.\n(5.4)\n\u03b4\nX\n+\n=\ni i\n2i j\n\u2206(x)2 \u220f\nB xi \u2212 x j \u220f\ni\ni6= j\n\nTherefore, we find that the Faddeev-Popov determinant is cancelled by the Jacobian coming\nform the solution of the Gauss law. The conditions (5.2,5.4) do not involve time derivatives and can be substituted in the path integral (5.1) at every time step: they eliminate\nthe X1 (t), X2(t) integrations in favor of their diagonal elements, {xi (t), yi(t)}. The \u03c8, \u03c8\u2020\nintegrations can be performed by substituting \u03c6i = \u03c1i exp(i\u03c6i ), using the Gauss law for \u03c1i\nand fixing the residual U (1)N symmetry with the linear conditions \u220fi \u03b4(\u03c6i ) causing no FP\ndeterminant.\nThe kinetic terms in the action can be rewritten using the constraint (5.4) as follows:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212iB Tr (X2\u1e8a1 ) + \u03c8\u2020 \u03c8\u0307 = \u2212iB Tr Xe2 \u039b\u0307 + [\u039b, Xe2 ]U \u2020U\u0307 + \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6\u0307 + \u03c6\u2020U \u2020U\u0307 \u03c6\n=\n\n\u2211\nn\n\n\u0001\n\u2212iB yn \u1e8bn + \u03c6n \u03c6\u0307n + k Tr(U \u2020U\u0307) .\n\n(5.5)\n\nThe term proportional to k is a total derivative that expresses the variation of phase of the\ndeterminant over the time interval, ik Arg(detU )|ttif , and does not contribute to the path\nintegral for integer k [26]. Therefore, the U (N) integrals factors out and one is left with\nthe phase-space path integral of the 2N conjugate variables of Calogero model, {xi , pi =\n\u2212B yi }, with Hamiltonian (2.18):\n!\nZ\nZ\nh f |ii =\n\n\u220f\n\nN\n\nD pi (t) D xi (t) exp\n\ni\n\ndt i \u2211 pi \u1e8bi \u2212 H(pi , xi )\ni=1\n\n19\n\n.\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fIn the real quantization, one is interested in the wave functions which depend on the\ncoordinate X1 and then, after reduction, on its eigenvalues. These wave functions can be\nobtained by replacing X = X1 +X2 in the the matrix expressions (3.14) with X1i j coordinates\nand X2i j derivatives w.r.t. them. In particular, for the ground state, the derivatives vanish [8]\nand one recovers the same determinant expression (3.14) with X \u2192 X1 , i.e. \u03a8k\u2212gs (X1, \u03c8).\n\u221a\nThe ground-state overlap is defined by (after freezing the vector to \u03c6i = k):\nh\u03a8k\u2212gs |\u03a8k\u2212gs i =\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nD X1 e\u2212BTrX1 k\u03a8k\u2212gs (X1 )k2 .\n\n(5.7)\n\nThis expression is actually an Hermitean matrix model, whose reduction to the eigenvalues is well known [35]: nothing depends on the unitary group that factorizes, leaving the\nJacobian \u2206(x)2 for the volume of the U (N) gauge group. The wave function becomes\n\u03a8k\u2212gs (U \u039bU \u2020) = exp(i\u03c3) \u2206(x)k kNk/2 , leading to:\nh\u03a8k\u2212gs |\u03a8k\u2212gs i = N\n\nZ\n\nD \u039b \u2206(x)2 e\u2212B \u2211i xi \u2206(x)2k .\n2\n\n(5.8)\n\nAfter reduction, we find that the wave function of the Calogero model should be defined\nwith an additional factor of the Vandermonde, \u03a6k\u2212gs = \u2206(x)\u03a8k\u2212gs , corresponding to the\nshift k \u2192 k + 1 found by several authors [5, 4].\nAnother way to understand this shift is through the comparison of the ground state energies computed in the original matrix theory and the Calogero model (the case k = 0 is already significant). In the Chern-Simons matrix model, the Hamiltonian H = \u03c9Tr(X12 +X22 )\n(setting B = 2) is a collection of N 2 harmonic oscillators and the k = 0 ground state is the\nFock vacuum. The quantization of these bosonic oscillators gives the ground state energy\nE0 = \u03c9 N 2 /2. On the other hand, the k = 0 Calogero model contains N oscillators that\n2\nwould give E0 = \u03c9 N/2 if quantized as boson and E0 = \u03c9 \u2211N\u22121\nn=0 (n + 1/2) = \u03c9 N /2 if\nthey are fermions. Therefore, the second choice should be made, leading to the ground\nstate wave function \u03a60\u2212gs = exp(\u2212B \u2211 x2i )\u2206(x) as the result of the Slater determinant of\nthe first N harmonic oscillator states.\n\n5.2 Holomorphic quantization\nThe path integral of the Chern-Simons matrix model in holomorphic form (3.2) is:\nh f |ii =\n\nZ\n\nD X (t) D X(t) D \u03c8(t) D \u03c8(t)\n\n\u00d7 exp\n\nZ\n\ndt\n\n\u0012\n\nB\nTr(X \u2020 \u1e8a) + \u03c8\u2020 \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 iH\n2\n20\n\n\u0013\n\n\u220f \u03b4(G(t)) FP .\nt\n\n(5.9)\n\n\fThe analysis goes in parallel with that of the previous section, with some differences regarding the reality conditions. The classical change of variables that corresponds to the\ncanonical transformation to the complex eigenvalues9 (3.7) and (3.10), is:\nX = V \u22121 \u039b V ,\neV ,\nX \u2020 = V \u22121 \u039b\n\n\u03c8 = V \u22121 \u03c6 ,\n\u03c8\u2020 = e\n\u03c6V ,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere \u039b is diagonal and V belongs to the quotient of linear complex matrices modulo the\nreal diagonal ones, V \u2208 GL(N, C)/RN . In the k = 0 case, the normal matrices are diagoe = \u039b\u2020 is also diagonal; for general\nnalized by a unitary transformation, V \u22121 = V \u2020 , thus \u039b\ne will be different from the conjugate of \u039b and non-diagonal. Therefore, we\nk, the matrix \u039b\nshould perform a transformation of the integration measure in (5.9) that does not respect\nthe complex conjugation of matrices at the classical level, i.e. a analytic continuation of\nthe matrix integral. The same remark applies to the integration of \u03c8. Nonetheless, the final\nresult will be real and well-defined.\nIn the matrix models arising from N = 2 topological string theory [36], one encounters\nan analogous situation of real (so-called A-model) and holomorphic (B-model) quantizations. The holomorphic matrix model has been analysed in depth by Lazaroiu in Ref. [37].\nFollowing his approach, we will consider X and X as independent complex matrices and\nR\n2\nD X as the holomorphic integral on a curve \u03b3 \u2208 CN that is left invariant by the holomorphic gauge transformations V . The reduction to the eigenvalues is in this case [37]:\nZ\n\n\u03b3\n\nDX =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3\n\nD \u039b D v \u2206(\u03bb)2 ,\n\ndv = V \u22121 dV .\n\n(5.11)\n\nNote that all three terms in the r.h.s. of this equation are holomorphic, thus respecting the\ncounting of degrees of freedom.\nTherefore, the holomorphic version of the Faddeev-Popov term (5.3) is:\nZ\n\u0001\n1 =\nD v D \u039b \u03b4 V XV \u22121 \u2212 \u039b \u2206(\u03bb)2 ,\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere the real delta function has been extended to complex holomorphic arguments.

Once they are eliminated,\nwe recognize that this path integral describes electrons in the lowest Landau level, with\ne amounts to a \"twisted\" rule of complex\ncoordinates {\u03bbn , e\u03bbn }. The replacement of X \u2020 by \u039b\nconjugation that will better analysed in the next section.\nThe result (5.16) can also be obtained in another way that uses the Ginibre decomposition\nof complex matrices respecting reality conditions [35]. After diagonalization of X , the\nmeasure of integration can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and their complex\nconjugates, as follows [38]:\n\nD X D X D \u03c8 D \u03c8 = |\u2206(\u03bb)|4\n\nN\n\n\u220f\n\nN\n\nd\u03bbi d\u03bbi\n\n\u220f\n\ni6= j=1\n\ni=1\n\nN\n\ndvi j dvi j\n\n\u220f d\u03c6i d\u03c6i .\n\n(5.17)\n\ni=1\n\nThe dvi j integral can be further elaborated, thanks to the decomposition [35]:\nV = DY U ,\n\n(5.18)\n\nwhere D is a diagonal, positive real matrix (D \u2192 I for the mentioned quotient), Y is upper\ntriangular with diagonal elements equal to one and U is unitary. The measure \u220fi6= j dvi j dvi j\n22\n\n\ffactorized into the unitary measure \u220fi> j d\u03c9i j d\u03c9i j and the measure \u220fi< j d\u03b1i j d\u03b1i j for\nd\u03b1 = Y \u22121 dY . The earlier variables (5.10) are expressed in the coordinates (5.18) as follows,\ne = H \u039b H \u22121 ,\n\u039b\n\ne\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2020 H \u22121 ,\n\nand the Gauss constraint reads,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u2020 \u22121\n\u03b4\n+\n\u03c6\n(\u03c6\nH\n)\n\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nH\u039bH\ni\nj\ni\nj\n\u220f\nij\ni6= j\n\nH = YY \u2020 ,\n\n\u220f\ni\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b4 \u03c6i (\u03c6\u2020 H \u22121 )i \u2212 k .\n\n(5.19)\n\n(5.20)\n\nWe see that (N 2 \u2212 N) gauge degrees of freedom have disappeared, while the (N 2 \u2212 N) variables of Y , i.e. of the similarity transformation H, should be fixed by the Gauss constraint\nin terms of {\u03bbn , \u03bbn , \u03c6m , \u03c6m }.\nAlthough in complex conjugate pairs, these coordinates do not have a simple dynamics and the reduced path integral cannot be interpreted in the quantum Hall effect. This\nset of variables was also considered by Karabali and Sakita [8], with the difference that\nthey allowed {Hnm , \u03c6n } to fluctuate because no gauge fixing was included in the path integral. Although fully legitimate for finite N, this approach does not allow to disentangle\nthe eigenvalues from the remaining variables and makes the physical interpretation harder.\nTherefore, we are led to reintroduce the earlier variables {e\u03bbn , e\n\u03c6n } in the path integral via\nthe identities,\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001 \u0011 \u0010\n\u2020 \u22121\n\u22121\ne\u03bbn d e\ne\ne\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\nH\n,\n(5.21)\n\u03b4\nd\n\u03c6\n\u03b4\n\u03bb\n\u2212\nH\u039bH\n1 =\nn\nn\nn\n\u220f\nnn\nnn\n\nn\n\nand solve for {\u03bbn , \u03c6n } and {Ynm } (or {Hnm } without extra Jacobian, Y \u22121 DY = H \u22121 D H\n[35]). The result is the following: the first two deltas in (5.20,5.21) combine into \u03b4(\u039b \u2212\ne\nH \u22121 \u039bH)\ntimes the Jacobian |\u2206(\u03bb)|\u22124 that cancels the contribution from the integration\nmeasure (5.17). This result is derived in analogy with the other deltas occurring before and\nexplicitly checked for N = 2.\n\n5.3 Complex overlaps\nThe integration measure for the Chern-Simons matrix model in holomorphic quantization\nis obtained from the coherent states of the matrix components (3.4), with the inclusion of\nthe Gauss-law constraint and Faddeev-Popov term (B = 2):\nh\u03a81 |\u03a82 i =\n\nZ\n\nD X D X D \u03c8D \u03c8 e\u2212TrX\n\n\u2020 X\u2212\u03c8\u2020 \u03c8\n\n\u03b4 (G) FP \u03a81 (X , \u03c8) \u03a82 (X , \u03c8) .\n\n(5.22)\n\nUsing the previous solutions of the constraints (5.12) and (5.13), we find the reduced measure:\nh\u03a81 |\u03a82 i =\n\nZ\n\n\u220f\nn\n\n\u2212\u2211\nde\u03bbn d\u03bbn d e\n\u03c6n d\u03c6n e n\n\n23\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne\u03bbn \u03bbn +e\n\u03c6n \u03c6n\n\n\fe e\n\u00d7 \u03a81 (\u039b,\n\u03c6) \u03a82 (\u039b, \u03c6)\n\ne\ne i j =e\u03bbi \u03b4i j \u2212(1\u2212\u03b4i j ) \u03c6i \u03c6 j\n\u03c6i \u03c6i =k, \u039b\n\u03bb \u2212\u03bb\ni\n\ne\n\n.\n\n(5.23)\n\nj\n\nIn this expression, the wave function \u03a81 (X , \u03c8) is first complex conjugated and then the\ne The frozen {e\nmatrix X \u2020 is replaced by \u039b.\n\u03c6n , \u03c6n } are again maintained for allowing normal\norderings. For example, the N = 2 ground state overlap reads (up to constants):\n\u0012\n\u0013k\nZ\n2k\n\u2212e\u03bb1 \u03bb1 \u2212e\u03bb2 \u03bb2 e\ne\ne\ne\n\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 +\n\u03a8k\u2212gs |\u03a8k\u2212gs N=2 = d \u03bb1 d\u03bb1 d \u03bb2 d\u03bb2 e\n(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )k .\n\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n(5.24)\nOwning to the twisted rule of conjugation, this overlap does not have the standard expression for the Laughlin wave function in the quantum Hall effect:\n\u03a8k\u2212gs |\u03a8k\u2212gs\n\nN=2\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndz1 dz1 dz2 dz2 e\u2212z1 z1 \u2212z2 z2 (z1 \u2212 z2 )k (z1 \u2212 z2 )k .\n\n(5.25)\n\nHere, we remark that the physically relevant quantities are the values of the overlap integrals, normalized to that of the ground state: thus, the discrepancy between (5.24) and\n(5.25) does not immediately imply that the matrix theory does not describe the Laughlin\nstates.\nThe rule of conjugation in the overlap integral (5.23) is consistent with the result of the\nchange of variables of section 3: actually, we see that the covariant derivative (3.10) acting\non the holomorphic wave function \u03a82 , can be adjoined as follows:\nh\u03a81 |Tr(X \u2020n) \u03a82 i = hTr(X n) \u03a81 |\u03a82 i .\n\n(5.26)\n\n\u2020 = L , both in the\nTherefore, the W\u221e operators satisfy the correct Hermiticity rule, Lnm\nmn\nmatrix (4.10) and reduced (4.16) coordinates. In conclusion, the twisted conjugation rule\nguarantees the Hermiticity of the covariant derivative that shows up in the reduced coordinates.\n\nThis result is rather important for the physical interpretation of the Chern-Simons matrix\nmodel. The main physical aspect of this theory is the realization of the Laughlin wave function in the ground state thanks to the conditions set by the Gauss law, following from the\nclassical non-commutativity of fields (section 3.1). Actually, U (N) group theory arguments\n[7] prove that all wave functions should contain the Laughlin ground state as a factor (cf.\nEq.(3.14)), thus the ground state is stable (incompressible). Unwanted states representing\nsmaller droplets of fluid are possible in the matrix Fock space, but they do not respect the\nGauss law and are not physical states. In conclusion, stability come from gauge invariance\nand the Gauss law condition.\nIn the reduced eigenvalue basis, the gauge symmetry has been projected out, but the\nstability of the ground state is still proven the W\u221e incompressibility conditions, that are\n24\n\n\fsatisfied thanks to the statistical interaction, i.e. to the covariant derivatives. As in the\nChern-Simons-matter field theory approach by Fradkin and Lopez [20], the stability of\nthe Laughlin ground state is realized by adding a further gauge interaction, rather than a\ntwo-body repulsion between the electrons [39]. In the reduced theory (5.16,5.23), ordinary\nderivatives \u2202/\u2202\u03bbn could create states of lower energy and higher density, i.e. generate\ninstabilities; however, these operators are forbidden because they are not Hermitean under\nthe twisted conjugation rule (5.23), and thus create non-unitary states; the W\u221e generators\nLnm are the only available Hermitean operators for creating excitations. In conclusion, the\nHermitean conjugation of (5.23) is consistent with the presence of the statistical interaction\nthat stabilizes the Laughlin ground state.\nIt remains to be proven that the unconventional overlaps (5.23) take the same value (for\nphysical states only) of the ordinary quantum Hall expressions. Actually, as discussed in\nsection 4.1, Eq.(4.5), a coordinate-free characterization of the overlaps in the quantum Hall\neffect is obtained by expressing them as commutators of the W\u221e algebra. Thus, the proof\nof the correspondence between the matrix and Hall overlaps is equivalent to the derivation\nof the unitary representations of the W\u221e algebra in the Chern-Simons matrix model.\nAnother aspect of measure of integration (5.23) is the lack of the shift k \u2192 k + 1, that\nwas found in the real quantization and was crucial for the analysis of the W\u221e symmetry in\nsection 4.3. In particular, for k = 0, we do not recover the known result10 |\u2206(\u03bb)|2 for the\nmeasure of the ensemble of normal complex matrices [35], that should correspond to the\n\u03bd = 1 quantum Hall effect [38]. The reason of this discrepancy is coming from the different\ndefinitions of the measure of integration: in our case, we solved the delta function of the\nGauss constraint coming from the integration of the A0 field in the Lagrangian; in Ref. [38],\nthey computed the induced metric on the manifold of the classical constraint [X , X \u2020] = 0 in\n2\nthe space CN of complex matrices. The two analyses are not in contradiction: indeed, the\nGauss constraint is degenerate for k = 0, where it admits both types of solution, depending\non how the quantity \u03b4(0) is regularized. On the contrary, for k > 0, the constraint is made\nnon-degenerate by the presence of the extra field \u03c8 and our results are not ambiguous and\nhold in the limit k \u2192 0+ .\nThe study of the ground state energy provides another way to analyse this issue, as\ndiscussed at the end of section 5.1. In the present case of quadratic Hamiltonian, the ground\nstate energy is also related to the filling fraction, i.e. to the size of the droplet of fluid [4]:\nfor a circular droplet of uniform fluid, one finds hR2 i = (N/2\u03c0) Area, and therefore:\n\n10 Note\n\n\u0001\nB Area\nB\n2\u03c9\n1\n=\n= 2 hTr X12 + X22 i = 2 E0 .\n\u03bd\n2\u03c0 N\nN\nN\n\nthat e\u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb\u0304n for k \u2192 0.\n\n25\n\n(5.27)\n\n\f\u0001\nIn the real case, we got hTr X12 + X22 i = hTr X X \u2020 + N 2 /2i, namely a shift in the ground\nstate energy leading to 1/\u03bd = k + 1. In the holomorphic matrix quantization of section 3,\nthe normal ordering is hTr Xa2i = h\u2211i j Xi j \u2202/\u2202Xi j i, yielding no shift (and vanishing E0 for\nk = 0). Thus, it seems that our results (5.23) is consistent with the operator ordering of\nmatrices in holomorphic quantization. On the other hand, the ordering adopted for the W\u221e\noperators in the reduced coordinates (4.16) seems to be different, because the incompressibility conditions are satisfied by the shifted wave function \u03a6k\u2212gs (cf. Eq.(4.17)). The shift\nin the wave functions is also important for changing the statistic of the reduced particle\ndegrees of freedom from bosonic to fermionic.\nAlthough we do not presently understand these facts completely, they seem to indicate\nthat the derivation of the reduced holomorphic path integral and overlap should be modified\nby allowing for ground state fluctuations. One possibility is to include an additional measure by hand in the starting expression of the complex matrix overlap (5.22). This should\nbe a gauge invariant, self-adjoint (real positive) quantity, carrying no charge for the \u03c8 field,\ni.e. made of X , X \u2020 only, and should reduce to |\u2206(\u03bb)|2 for k = 0. The following measure\nsatisfies these rather stringent requirements and is inspired by the work of Ref. [40]:\n\u0012\u0010\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0011 \u0013\n\u2020i\u22121 j\u22121\ni\u22121\ne\nM = det Tr X\nX\n= det \u039b\n\u2206(\u03bb) .\n(5.28)\njj\n\nThis quantity inserted in the overlap (5.22) realizes the shift k \u2192 k + 1 in the eigenvalue\nwave function \u03a6 of section 4.3. Note also that a similar determinant expression involving\n\u0001\nthe \u03c8 field, det \u03c8\u2020 X \u2020i\u22121 X j\u22121 \u03c8) , is actually the modulus square of the ground state wave\nfunction. The measure (5.28) should also be included in the holomorphic path integral\n(5.9) for consistency, where it defines an instantaneous repulsive interaction that enforces\nthe fermionic character of the electrons.\n\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we described the holomorphic quantization of the Chern-Simons matrix\nmodel; we performed a change of matrix variables that allowed to solve the Gauss-law\nconstraint and to map the N 2 -dimensional quantum mechanics of D0 branes with ChernSimons dynamics into the problem of N particles in the lowest Landau level. We found that\nthe matrix theory describes the Laughlin ground state wave function and the corresponding\nexcitations, together with a statistical interaction that is crucial to stabilize the ground state\nand verify the W\u221e incompressibility conditions. Some gaps are still present in our analysis: we did not obtain the full representation of the W\u221e algebra in the theory and could not\ncompletely determine the measure in the overlap integrals. Nonetheless, we showed that\n26\n\n\fthe eventual proof of the W\u221e symmetry in the matrix theory would definitely establish the\ncorrespondence with the Laughlin Hall states, independently of coordinate choices.\nThe non-commutative Chern-Simons theory has shown rather interesting features: besides incorporating the discrete nature of the electrons [1], it enhances the quantum repulsion of the electrons in the first Landau level,\n[[\u03bbn , \u03bbm ]] =\n\n2~\n\u03b4nm ,\nB\n\n(6.1)\n\nby means of the non-commutativity of classical matrices,\n[X , X \u2020] = 2\u03b8 ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nthus reducing the filling fraction from \u03bd = 1 to \u03bd = 1/(1 + B\u03b8). The (integer) statistical\ninteraction among the electrons found in holomorphic quantization can actually be deduced\nfrom the non-commutativity. Equation (6.2) can be interpreted as a gauge field strength\nby representing non-commutative fields, i.e. matrices, as covariant derivatives. Setting\nX = Z + R, where Z is a normal matrix (unitarely equivalent to \u039b), we can view Z as the\nordinary derivative ([Z, Z \u2020 ] = 0) and R as the gauge potential. The solution of (6.2) found\nin section 3 is thus:\nX = Z,\n\n(R = 0) ,\n\nX \u2020 = Z \u2020 + R\u2020 ,\n\n[Z, R\u2020 ] = 2\u03b8 .\n\n(6.3)\n\nNote that such decomposition of the covariant derivative is preserved under GL(N, C) transformations X \u2192 V \u22121 XV provided that the gauge potential transforms as R \u2192 V \u22121 RV +\nV \u22121 [Z, V ].\nA known property of the Laughlin Hall states is the presence of non-trivial quantummechanical long-range correlations that cause the fractional statistics of excitations [12]\nand the topological order of the ground state on compact surfaces [16]. An interesting open\nquestion is how to recover these features in the matrix theory. The 1/(k + 1) fractional\nstatistics of two quasi-hole excitations, with matrix wave function,\n\u03a82q\u2212hole (z1 , z2 ; X , \u03c8) = det (z1 \u2212 X ) det (z2 \u2212 X ) \u03a8k\u2212gs (X , \u03c8) ,\n\n(6.4)\n\nshould come out as a (re)normalization effect in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. Note that for N finite\nthis state belongs to the same (unique) W\u221e representation that includes the ground state (cf.\nEq.(3.14)).\nThe Chern-Simons matrix model could provide a concrete setting for studying the \"exactness\" and \"universality\" of the Laughlin wave function, upon using the sophisticated\ntools of matrix models [38] [41], as well as the new features of non-commutative field\ntheories [13][14]. Among the possible developments, we mention:\n27\n\n\f\u2022 The description of the Jain states at filling fraction \u03bd = (k + 1/m)\u22121 by a suitable\nextension of the boundary terms (cf. Ref.[6]).\n\u2022 The study of Morita's equivalences in the non-commutative theories [13][14][11],\nthat change the non-commutativity parameter \u03b8 by a SL(2, Z) transformation, and\ncould actually relate the matrix theories of different plateaus.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank A.
