In zero magnetic field the temperature dependence of the resistance reveals a sequence of distinct regimes upon decreasing temperature crossing\nover from logarithmic to activated behavior with the variable-range hopping squeezing in between.\nIn perpendicular magnetic fields below 2 T, the thermally activated regime retains at intermediate\ntemperatures, whereas at ultralow temperatures, the resistance increases faster than that of the\nthermally activated type. This indicates a change of the mechanism of the conductivity. We find\nthat at higher magnetic fields the thermally activated behavior disappears and the magnetoresistive\nisotherms saturate towards the value close to quantum resistance h/e2 .\n\nThe subject of suppression of superconductivity by disorder in thin superconducting films can be traced back\nto a pioneering work of early forties by Shal'nikov [1],\nwhere it was noticed for the first time, that the superconducting transition temperature, Tc , decreases with\nthe decrease of the film thickness. Later, a number of experimental works revealed a drastic suppression in Tc in thin films with the growth of sheet resistance [2, 3, 4], which is determined by either film composition or thickness and serves as a parameter measuring\nthe degree of disorder. The observed behavior was in a\ngood quantitative accord with theoretical predictions by\nMaekawa and Fukuyama [5] and the subsequent work by\nFinkel'stein [6]. The physical picture behind suppressing superconductivity by disorder is that in quasi-twodimensional systems disorder inhibits electron mobility\nand thus impairs dynamic screening of the Coulomb interaction. This implies turning on the Coulomb repulsion between electrons which opposes Cooper attraction\nand, if strong enough, breaks down Cooper pairing and\ndestroys superconductivity. Importantly, according to\nmechanism of [6], the degree of disorder at which the\nCoulomb repulsion would balance the Cooper pair coupling is not sufficient to localize normal carriers; thus at\nthe suppression point superconductors transforms into a\nmetal. The latter can be turned into an insulator upon\nfurther increase of disorder. Therefore this mechanism,\nwhich is referred to as a fermionic mechanism, results in a\nsequential superconductor-metal-insulator transition [6].\nThere exists a seemingly alternative picture of the transition, the so-called bosonic mechanism, where the intermediate metallic phase collapses to a single point,\nimplying the direct disorder-driven superconductor-toinsulator transition (D-SIT) [7, 8]. Contrary to fermionic\nmechanism, the bosonic one realizes via localization of\nthe Cooper pairs, which survive even at the nonsuper-\n\nconducting side of the transition. However, numerical\nsimulations by Ghosal, Randeria, and Trivedi [9] demonstrated that this distinction is not valid: near the D-SIT\nthe homogeneously disordered film breaks up into superconducting islands separated by an insulating sea. Depending on the competition between the charging energy\nof a single island and the Josephson coupling between the\nneighboring islands, the film may become either superconducting or insulating, with the island-like structure\nmaintaining at both sides of the transition. Yet the details of the microscopic mechanism of the D-SIT are far\nfrom being understood, and uncovering the nature of the\nphase resulting from suppression of the superconductivity by disorder remains one of the major challenges of\ncondensed matter physics.\nIn this work we focus on the insulating side of the\nD-SIT. To begin with, we briefly summarize the up-todate experimental findings on the subject. In the early\nexperiments [2] with the very thinnest Pb films it was\nnoticed that once on the nonsuperconducting side, the\ntemperature dependence of resistance acquired an activated character:\nR = R0 exp(T0 /T ) .\n(1)\nStudy of the Bi films [10, 11] revealed three major regimes\nof the temperature resistance behavior in the insulator domain depending on the degree of disorder. The\nfilms closest to D-SIT exhibit comparatively weak insulating trend with conductance lowering as log T upon decreasing temperature. Moderately disordered films, that\nare more far from the D-SIT, demonstrate the EfrosShklovskii (ES) behavior, R = R1 exp[(TES /T )1/2 ], and\nthe resistance in most disordered films is thermally activated (1). The direct D-SIT was found in InOx films [12],\nexhibiting a sequence of temperature behaviors on the\nnonsuperconducting side: deep in the insulating regime,\nthe conductivity shows Mott's variable range hopping\n\n\f2\nas resistance per square. The samples were cooled down\nin the Oxford 200 TLE dilution refrigerator. Magnetic\nfields up to 10 T were applied perpendicular to the film\nsurface.\nWe start with the zero magnetic-field results obtained\nduring the cooling the cryostat down from room temperature. Shown in Fig. 1a are the temperature dependences of the resistance R(T ) of two samples, S\nand I. At room temperature, their resistances are close\n(R300 = 4.48 k\u03a9 and R300 = 4.76 k\u03a9, respectively), but\ndiverge upon decreasing temperature.

Interestingly, the\ncrossover from the activation to ES law, and eventually to\nMott's VRH regime was also observed in InOx composite films [14] upon increasing temperature. It was noticed\nin Ref. [12] that applying a relatively small perpendicular magnetic field (0.7 T) to the least disordered insulating films results in positive magnetoresistance, while\nmore resistive samples show purely negative magnetoresistance. Gantmakher's group carried out measurements\nof the effect of the magnetic field up to 20 T on the insulating InOx films in the vicinity of the D-SIT [15] and\nrevealed nonmonotonic magnetoresistance behavior: a\npositive magnetoresistance at low magnetic fields turning into a negative magnetoresistance upon increasing\nthe field. Importantly, several works, starting from the\nearliest [12, 15] and ending by recent [16] demonstrate\nthat in the zero magnetic field the resistance of insulating films closest to the transition deviates downward\nfrom the Arrhenius activated behavior at lowest temperatures. At high magnetic fields, the charge transfer mechanism appears the same as that at the zero field but high\ntemperatures and follows Mott's VRH law [15]. Another\nrecent finding worth noticing is the dependence of the\nactivation energy in InOx films on the linear size of the\nfilm (the distance between the leads) [17]. The D-SIT\nin TiN was found for the first time on the films prepared by magnetron sputtering [18]. On the insulating\nside close to the transition, the resistance exhibited thermally activated behavior till lowest temperatures available. In our preceding works [19, 20], where we were\ndealing with the thin TiN films grown by atomic layer\nchemical vapor deposition, an exceptionally sharp D-SIT\nwas found. At zero and low magnetic fields the resistance displayed thermally activated behavior with the\nnonmonotonic dependence of activation temperature on\nthe magnetic field. Here we present the novel results\non identically prepared samples showing that at the lowest temperatures the resistance deviates upward from the\nArrhenius activated dependence (1) in a contrast to observation in InOx films [12, 15, 16]. Hereafter we will\nreferring to this behavior as to hyperactivation. This behavior holds at low magnetic fields. At higher magnetic\nfields, instead of this low-temperature upturn, the resistance shows downward deviation from the Arrhenius\nactivation. The analysis of the corresponding magnetoresistance shows that it decays exponentially with field\ntowards the finite value close to the quantum resistance\nRQ = h/e2 .\nThe resistance was measured by the four-terminal technique in the linear I-V regime even at very low temperatures. The width of the film was 50 \u03bcm, the distance\nbetween the voltage probes was 100 \u03bcm, thus the sample comprised two squares.

Upon cooling down\nto 3 K both samples exhibit nearly identical logarithmic temperature dependence of the conductance (see inset in Fig. 1a), which is well described by the formula\nG(T )/G00 = A ln(kB T \u03c4 /~), where G(T ) = 1/R(T ) is\nthe conductance, G00 = e2 /(\u03c0h), and A = 2.55 for both\nsamples. This behavior is in accord with the theory\nof quantum corrections for quasi-two-dimensional disordered systems and can be attributed to localization and\nrepulsive electron-electron interaction corrections [21].\nTo characterize the behavior of the I-sample at low temperatures we replot R(T ) versus 1/T in Fig. 1b. In the\ntemperature interval between 0.25 and 0.9 K, the resistance is well fitted by a thermally activated dependence\nof Eq. (1), with T0 = 0.63 K being the activation temperature, and R0 \u2248 17 k\u03a9. Plotting the same data as\nlog R versus 1/T 1/2 one can see that the resistance can\nbe nicely fitted by the ES-law in the higher temperature\nrange 0.6 \u2013 6 K (see inset in Fig. 1b). Note, that the deviation from the ES-law towards the activation starts at\nthe temperature T . T0 . To summarize here, the evolution of R(T ) of the insulating TiN film in the zero magnetic field is as follows. As temperature decreases, the\nresistance shows first a logarithmic growth crossing over\ninto the ES-law, which in its turn, transforms into the\nArrhenius activated behavior, with all three subsequent\nregimes pairwise overlapping. So far the temperature behavior of R(T ) in TiN films more or less parallels that\nof InOx [13, 14]. An important difference arises at the\nvery lowest temperatures where R(T ) of TiN shoots up\nfrom the Arrhenius dependence contrasting the downturn\nobserved in InOx [12, 15, 16].\nTurning on the magnetic field we find its huge effect\non the transport properties of the insulating TiN films\n(see Fig. 2). Even a small ramping of the field from zero\nto 0.1 T at 220 mK causes at least the 30 times increase\nin the resistance; more specifically, the resistance grows\nfrom 2.9*105 \u03a9 to 107 \u03a9, which is the upper limit of the\nused measuring circuit. The magnetoresistance demonstrates pronounced nonmonotonic behavior: an abrupt\nraise and rapid drop of the resistance in the window of\nabout 1.5 T wide, the latter transforming into a flattening tail at large fields. At T = 220 mK, the negative\nmagnetoresistance of the insulating sample exceeds two\norders of magnitude, and at 10 T resistance drops down\nto R = 46 k\u03a9. Another interesting feature of the magnetoresistance is a gradual shift of the peak to higher\nfields upon increasing the temperature. This behavior is\nclearly seen in the inset showing enlarged images of the\nsubsequent three highest temperature isotherms.\nTaking the fixed-field cuts across the data presented\nin Fig. 2, we find that in the temperature range 0.3 \u2013\n0.9 K all the log R(T, Bi ) versus 1/T plots are linear at\nall magnetic fields. Thus, making use of the Eq. (1),\nwe have determined field dependences T0 (B) (shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 3) and R0 (B) (which vary between 13\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\nT\n\nHA\n\n0.0\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\nB (T)\n\n6\n\nT (1/K)\n\n6\n\n8\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1/\n\nFIG. 3: Arrhenius plots of the isomagnetic temperature dependencies of the resistance of the insulating sample.

At very lowest temperatures, however, the log R(1/T ) plots deviate\nfrom the straight lines and diverge in a fan-like manner. To make the observed features even more transparent we have grouped the symbols for the data in Fig. 3\n\n\f4\ninto three branches. The solid symbols correspond to the\ntemperature dependences taken within the positive magnetoresistance field window, i.e., at the magnetic fields\nBi < 0.32 T. The 'crosses' correspond to fields Bi between 0.32 T and 2 T, at the negative slope of the peak.\nAnd, finally, open symbols denote isomagnetic temperature dependences at high fields Bi > 2 T, corresponding\nto the negative magnetoresistance tails. The zero field\nresistance is shown as a solid line, and the slope of the\ndashed line corresponds to the activation temperature\nat zero field. Figure 3 shows that in relatively small\nmagnetic fields the resistance curves sharply jump upward from the Arrhenius activation behavior below some\nmagnetic field dependent temperature THA (B). This hyperactivated behavior maintains till fields not exceeding 2 T. We define the characteristic temperature of the\ntransition to the hyperactivated regime by the relation\nR(THA ) = 2R0 exp(THA /T0 ), i.e., as the temperature\nat which the actually measured resistance exceeded two\ntimes the resistance obtained by extrapolation from the\nactivated temperature interval. The inset in Fig. 3 shows\nmagnetic field dependence of THA (B) which appears nonmonotonic and looks similar to the field dependence of\nT0 . It is noteworthy that the hyperactivated regime\nexists on the both, positive- (solid symbols) and negative (crosses) magnetoresistance sides of the peak. Upon\nthe further increasing magnetic field, the hyperactivation\nvanishes and is replaced by the flattening or downward\ndeviation from the presumed activated behavior (open\nsymbols). We emphasize here that the linearity of the\nlog R(1/T ) dependence in the 0.3 \u2013 0.9 K window at fields\nbeyond 3 T, can by no means be taken as an evidence of\nthe thermally activated carrier transfer, since the activa-\n\n0.0\n\n-0.4\n\nR\n\n-0.6\n\nR\nln[(1/\n\n2\n\nsat\n\n(h/e )\n\n100 mK\n\n1.1\n\nsat\n\n1/\n\n2\n\nR)/(e /h)]\n\n-0.2\n\n1.0\n\n-0.8\n\nI\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n-1.0\n\n0.7\n0.0\n\n-1.2\n\n0\n\nsample A\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\nT (K)\n\n0.6\n\n4\n\n0.8\n\nB (T)\n\n1.0\n\n6\n\n900 mK\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: Scaling plot of the data shown in Fig. 2: For certain values of Rsat , ln [1/Rsat \u2212 1/R(B)] varies linearly vs. B,\nwith a T -independent slope. The linear slope corresponds\nto the characteristic field B \u2217 \u2243 11.2 T. Inset: Temperature\ndependence of Rsat for I-sample. We added data for superconducting sample A from Ref. [22].\n\ntion temperatures that come out from fitting procedure\nare very close or even less than the lower bound of the\nobservation interval, T0 . 0.3 K. Moreover, the data in\nthe whole temperature range T < 0.9 K and fields beyond\n3 T are much better linearized in the log R versus 1/T 1/2\nrepresentation. This suggests a recovery of the ES charge\ntransfer mechanism at intermediate fields, which for the\nzero magnetic field was observed at T > 0.6 K. We find\nthat upon increasing the magnetic field the ES characteristic temperature drops, whereas the preexponential\nfactor increases, in particular, at B = 3 T, TES = 1.8 K\nand R1 = 6.8 k\u03a9, and at B = 10 T, TES = 0.39 K\nand R1 = 12.6 k\u03a9. This indicates that the ES VRH\nis suppressed by high magnetic fields (judging from decreasing TES ) and that in the domain of the negative\nmagnetoresistance the electron transfer which at moderated magnetic fields is mediated by Cooper pairs hopping, becomes quasiparticle dominated process at the elevated fields. We expect that upon further rise of the\nmagnetic field the ES behavior changes to a metalliclike transport. At the same time, the behavior of the\nisotherms R(B) of the insulating sample at high B resembles that of the superconducting samples from the\nRef. [22], where it was described by the empirical relation\nG(T, B) = 1/Rsat (T ) \u2212 \u03b2(T ) exp(\u2212B/B \u2217 ), with B \u2217 being some characteristic field, and with Rsat being close to\nthe quantum resistance h/e2 . Following the same treatment as in [22], we present the R(B) data in a similar\nscaling form as G(B) = 1/Rsat \u2212 1/R(B) and plot it on\na logarithmic scale as function of B (see Fig. 4). Indeed,\nall the isotherms measured in the window from 900 mK\ndown to 100 mK are well linearized via the proper choice\nof a single fitting parameter Rsat for each temperature\n(shown in the inset in Fig. 4). The scaled 1/R(B) have\nthe same temperature independent slope, corresponding\nto the characteristic field B \u2217 \u2243 11.2 T, which is close to\nB \u2217 \u2243 10.7 T for the sample A from Ref. [22].\nWe would like to complement our findings with\nthe data on low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the local density of states in\nthe identically prepared TiN films [23]. It was found\nthat even in comparatively less weakly disordered films,\njudging from the room temperature resistance, the superconducting state appears inhomogeneous. Furthermore,\nin spite of the fact, that the suppression of the superconducting transition temperature follows the fermionic\nmechanism [6], the analysis of the whole aggregate of\nthe data supports the idea that the film in the critical\nregion of the D-SIT can be viewed as an array of the\nsuperconducting islands immersed into an insulating sea\nor self-organized two-dimensional Josephson junction array [9, 13, 15, 19, 20, 24].\nTo gain an insight into the hyperactivation behavior\nfrom this standpoint, we juxtapose our data with the\ncorresponding findings on granular films [25] and on twodimensional Josephson junction arrays (2DJJ) [26, 27,\n\n\f5\n28, 29, 30]. These systems showed two distinct activated\nregimes with the different Arrhenius slopes. The smaller\none is observed in the high fields and/or high temperature domain, where the superconductivity in the granules/superconducting electrodes was suppressed. In the\nlow-T /low-B region, where granules/superconducting\nelectrodes became superconducting, the Arrhenius activated curves acquired the larger slope. Specifically,\nin 2DJJ arrays, the activation energy in the \"normal\"\nstate, which was found to be close to (1/4)Ec , where Ec\nwas the charging energy of a single junction, increased\nto (1/4)Ec + \u22060 , with \u22060 being the gap of a superconducting electrode [26, 27, 28]. However, having decided\nto straightforwardly ascribe the upturn in log R versus\n1/T dependencies measured in our TiN films to opening the superconducting gap, we would have encountered\nimmediate problems. Namely, using, for example, our\ndata at B = 0.06 T, where the low temperature activation temperature as crudely estimated from the upturn\nis T0l \u2243 6 K, while at high temperatures T0 = 0.71 K,\nwe arrive at the magnitude of the opening gap to be\nof about 0.6 of that of the bulk TiN [31]. This is in\nstrong conflict with the STM data of Ref. [23], where\nthis ratio is estimated not to exceed 0.1 at the insulating side near the D-SIT. Furthermore, having assumed\nthat the observed upturn reflects the activation behavior, i.e. switching from a low activation energy to higher\none we derive from the above analysis the nonphysically\nsmall pre-exponential factor, R0l \u2248 1.3 * 10\u22125 \u03a9. This\nmakes the notion of the activation transport at lowest\ntemperatures in our films meaningless. On the other\nhand, Kanda and Kobayashi, and later Yamaguchi et\nal [29, 30], observed that the resistance of the 2DJJ array in the regime where electrodes are superconducting,\nincreases, with decreasing temperature, faster than that\nof the thermal-activation type. They interpreted it as\na signature of the charge binding-unbinding BerezinskiiKosterlitz-Thouless (C-BKT) transition [32]. We propose that the hyperactivated behavior observed in our\nexperiments is of the same nature and signalizes the formation of a low temperature C-BKT-phase, which we call\na superinsulator [33, 34].\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the temperatureand the magnetic field dependencies of the resistance of\nthin TiN films in the critical region of the disorder-driven\nsuperconductor-insulator transition. We have found that\nquantum metallicity, i.e. the saturation of high field\nnegative magnetoresistance near the h/e2 is a generic\nproperty of these films which belong not only to the\nsuperconducting- but also to the insulating side of the\ntransition. At the same time, in the low perpendicular\nmagnetic fields domain the thermally activated regime\ntakes place at intermediate temperatures. At ultralow\ntemperatures, the resistance becomes hyperactivated,\ni.e., grows faster than that of the thermally activated\ntype. We relate the change of the mechanism of the con-\n\nductivity with the charge binding-unbinding BerezinskiiKosterlitz-Thouless transition and refer to the appearing low-temperature BKT-phase as to a superinsulating\nstate. The conditions of formation of a superinsulating\nphase accounting for the role of the finite-size effects and\nthe finite-range charge screening require further research.\nWe are grateful to A.
