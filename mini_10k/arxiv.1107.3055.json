In the case of a simple algebraic group G of type G2\nover a field of characteristic p > 0 we study the cohomology modules of line bundles on the flag variety for G. Our main result is\na complete determination of the vanishing behavior of such cohomology in the case where the line bundles in question are induced\nby characters from the lowest p2 -alcoves.\nWhen Uq is the quantum group corresponding to G whose parameter q is a complex root of unity of order prime to 6 we give a\ncomplete (i.e. covering all characters) description of the vanishing\nbehavior for the corresponding quantized cohomology modules.\n\n1. Introduction\nThroughout this paper G will denote an almost simple algebraic\ngroup of type G2 over a field of characteristic p > 5. We shall give\na complete description of the vanishing behavior of the cohomology of\nthose line bundles on the flag variety for G which correspond to weights\nfrom the lowest p2 -alcoves in all the Weyl chambers for G. To achieve\nthis we shall need almost all available methods that we know for such\ncomputations.\nThe strategy we use will apply to other types as well but a similar\ndescription for higher ranks seems out of reach. Our computations\nalso give some information about the G-structure of the cohomology\nmodules but the full story here is still open. By an illustrating example\n(see Section 8) we demonstrate that our present techniques are not\nenough to handle the case where the weights lie outside the p2 -alcoves.\nOn the other hand, we can handle all weights for the corresponding\nquantized G2 situation at complex roots of unity, see below and Section\n9.\nKM supported in part by JSPS Grant in Aid for Scientific Research #23540023.\n1\n\n\fOur assumption p > 5 is necessary in order for alcoves to contain\nintegral weights in their interior. We need this in order to apply translation functors effectively. However, many parts of our methods apply\nfor p \u2264 5 as well but we leave it to the reader to formulate and check\nthe statements in these cases (for instance when p = 2 the only weight\nin the lowest p2 -range is \u2212\u03c1 so there is nothing to check in that case).\nOur results are given in terms of figures of alcoves decorated with those\nnumbers i for which there is an extra non-vanishing i-th cohomology\nof the line bundles corresponding to the weights of the alcove. To see\nthe patterns in these figures we need to take p a bit larger, p \u2265 17,\nalthough our proofs work for all p > 5! The figures for smaller p will\nbe a subset of our figures. We leave to the reader to do the appropriate\ncuts.\nLet Uq denote the quantum group of type G2 with q a complex root\nof unity of order l. We assume that l is prime to 6. Then there are\ncohomology modules for Uq (derived functors of the induction functor\nfrom a Borel subalgebra of Uq ) which are quantized counterparts of the\nabove line bundle cohomology. Our techniques apply to this case as\nwell. Moreover, the modular phenomena of 'higher alcoves' (for the\npowers of p) are not present in this case. Hence we are able to give the\ncomplete vanishing behavoir of quantized line bundle cohomology for\ntype G2 .\nThe questions studied in this paper go back to the final section of\n[A81]. Here the first author sketched a description of the vanishing\nbehavior of line bundle cohomology on the flag varieties for all rank\n2 groups. However, as pointed out by the second author there are\nsome errors in the statements and J. Humphreys pinpointed in [H]\nsome specific inaccuracies in the G2 -case. In the survey article [A07]\nsome of this was repaired but when we needed this kind of results in\nconnection with our work [AK] we decided to carefully go through all\ncomputations. The outcome of this was recorded in Appendix B of\n[AK] where we referred to a preliminary version of the present paper\nfor details. With a few modifications we follow the 6 step program\noutlined in this appendix.\nWe are grateful to J. E. Humphreys for many discussions over the\nyears on these issues and for some detailed comments on the contents\nof the preliminary version of this paper.\n\n2\n\n\fs\nx = st\n\ne\n35\n30\n29\n34\n28\n27 33\n26\n25 32\n23\n22\n31\n21\n16 18\n20 24\n19\n15\n17\n13 14\n11 12\n8\n10\n6\n5 7 9\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nz = sts\n\nt\n\ny = ts\n\nw = tst\n\ntz\n\nFigure 1. Label of some alcoves and Weyl chambers\n2. Notation and preliminaries\nWe shall generally use the notation from [AK]. In this section we\nrecall the main players and we introduce some specific notations for the\nG2 -case we are dealing with. Bits of further notations are introduced\nas we go along and we refer to loc. cit. for any unexplained notation.\nIn the algebraic group G of type G2 we fix a maximal torus T and\nwe let R denote the corresponding root system. We choose a set of\n3\n\n\fpositive roots R+ and \u03b1 and \u03b2 with \u03b2 long denote the two simple roots\nin R+ . Then B will denote the Borel subgroup corresponding to \u2212R+ .\nThe line bundles on the flag variety G/B are induced by the characters\nof B. We let X denote the character group of B, and for \u03bb \u2208 X we\nuse the abbreviation H i (\u03bb) for the i-th cohomology group of the line\nbundle on G/B induced by \u03bb.\nInside X we have the set of dominant weights X + = {\u03bb \u2208 X |\nh\u03bb, \u03b3 \u2228i \u2265 0 for all \u03b3 \u2208 R+ }. The Weyl group W is the group generated\nby the reflections in the walls of X + , i.e., by the two elements s = s\u03b1\nand t = s\u03b2 . The bottom alcove in X + is A1 = {\u03bb \u2208 X + | h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b3 \u2228 i <\np for all \u03b3 \u2208 R+ }. Here \u03c1 = 5\u03b1 + 3\u03b2 is half the sum of the positive\nroots. Note that 0 \u2208 A1 because of our assumption p > 5. The affine\nWeyl group Wp is the group generated by the reflections in the 3 walls\nof A1 . The alcoves in X are the the mirror images of A1 under Wp via\nthe dot action (i.e., the action with origin \u2212\u03c1).\nRecall that as a consequence of the strong linkage principle [A80a]\nall composition factors of a cohomology module H i (\u03bb) have (dominant)\nhighest weights in Wp * \u03bb. Moreover, if for \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 \u01001 we denote by T\u03bb\u03bc\nthe translation functor from the \u03bb-block to the \u03bc-block then we have\nT\u03bb\u03bc H i (w * \u03bb) = H i (w * \u03bc) for all \u03bb \u2208 F, \u03bc \u2208 F\u0304 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere F denotes a non-0-facette of \u01001 , i.e., F is A1 itself or one of\nits walls. By F\u0304 we denote the closure of F . We note that any \u03bb \u2208\nX belonging to a 0-facette must be an element of \u2212\u03c1 + pX by our\nassumption p > 5.\nBy (2.1) we immediately deduce that if a cohomology module vanishes for some weight in a facette (in our case an alcove or a wall)\nthen the same cohomology vanishes at any other weight in the closure\nof that facette. More generally, this translation principle allows us to\ndetermine the composition factors of the cohomology of a weight in the\nclosure of a facette once we have the corresponding information for a\nsingle weight in the facette. Therefore we abuse notation and sometimes write H i (F ) for a cohomology group of a (non-specified) weight\nin the facette F .\nWe enumerate the first few alcoves in X + as in [H], see Fig. 1. The\nalcove containing the number i is then denoted Ai . If Ai and Aj share\na wall we denote this common wall by Fi/j . In Fig. 1 we have also\ngiven names to some of the Weyl chambers that we shall need often.\nWe have set x = st, y = ts, z = sy, and w = tx.\n4\n\n\fIf v is any element of W then we set Avi = v * Ai and similarly\nv\nFi/j\n= v * Fi/j . By the chamber v we will mean the chamber v * X + .\nRecall that H 0 (\u03bb) 6= 0 if and only if \u03bb \u2208 X + . Moreover, Kempf's\nvanishing theorem says that H i (\u03bb) = 0 for all i > 0 when \u03bb \u2208 X + .\nSerre duality implies that H i (\u03bb)\u2217 \u2243 H 6\u2212i (\u2212\u03bb \u2212 2\u03c1) for all \u03bb \u2208 X.\nIn characteristic zero the vanishing behavior of line bundle cohomology (on any flag variety) is determined by Bott's theorem [B] which\nsays that H i (\u03bb) 6= 0 if and only if \u03bb \u2208 w * X + for some w \u2208 W of length\ni. By semi-continuity (or use the universal coefficient theorem in (3.2)\nbelow) we have that the dimension of a cohomology module in characteristic p > 0 is at least equal to the dimension of the corresponding\ncohomology module in characteristic 0. Hence we have H i (\u03bb) 6= 0 in\nall chambers w * X + where w \u2208 W has length i. In the following sections we will therefore concentrate to the \"extra\" cohomology, i.e., on\nH i (\u03bb)'s or H i (A)'s for \u03bb or A lying outside these chambers.\nIn [A79] the first author obtained the complete vanishing description\n+\nfor H 1 (\u03bb) and (via Serre duality) H |R |\u22121 (\u03bb), see also the alternative\nformulations in Corollary 2.7 and Remark 2.8 of [A07]. When \u03bb belongs\nto the lowest p2 -alcoves we have in Fig.2 illustrated this result in our\ncase by entering 1 (resp. 5) on the alcoves where extra H 1 - (resp. H 5 -)\noccur.\nThe above remarks mean that the cohomology modules we have left\nto describe are H i (\u03bb) with 2 \u2264 i \u2264 4. We deal with these after first\ndescribing the methods we use in the next section.\n\n3. Methods\nIn this section we will describe the methods we use to determine the\nvanishing or non-vanishing of a cohomology module H i (\u03bb). The results\nmay all be found in the literature and are slight variations of the 6 step\nprogram sketched in [AK, Appendix B]. They all apply in the case of\na general flag variety although we have not always chosen to formulate\nthem in their most general versions. Our aim has been to gear them\ntowards the G2 -problem of the present paper.\nWe set for each n \u2265 1\nPn = {\u03bb \u2208 X | h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b3 \u2228 i < pn for all \u03b3 \u2208 R}.\n5\n\n\fThis is the union over all Weyl chambers of their lowest pn -alcoves.\nWhen \u03bb \u2208 P1 the cohomology H \u2022 (\u03bb) behaves according to Bott's theorem in characteristic 0, see [A80a]. We shall use this to get our first\nresults for weights in P2 .\nWe call a weight \u03bd \u2208 X special if there exists \u03bb \u2208 X such that\n\u03bd = p * \u03bb. Here we have extended the \"dot notation\" to include also\nmultiplication by p on X, i.e., p * \u03bb = p(\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1. Thus \u03bd is special iff\n\u03bd \u2208 p * (\u2212\u03c1) + pX. Note that \u03bb \u2208 P1 if and only if p * \u03bb \u2208 P2 . Also we\nsay \u03bb is singular iff h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b3 \u2228 i = 0 for some \u03b3 \u2208 R, in which case p * \u03bb\nis singular and vice versa. Otherwise we say \u03bb is regular. Likewise p*\npreserves the individual Weyl chambers.\nSetting Xp = {\u03bb \u2208 X + | h\u03bb, \u03b3 \u2228 i < p for all simple roots \u03b3} we then\nhave the following proposition, cf. Step 1 in [AK, Appendix B]\nProposition 3.1. Let \u03bd be a special point. Then\ni) If \u03bd \u2208 P2 and is singular then H i (\u03bd) = 0 for all i \u2208 N.\nii) If \u03bd is regular and w is the element in W for which w * \u03bd \u2208 X +\nthen H l(w) (\u03bd \u00b1 \u03bb) 6= 0 for all \u03bb \u2208 Xp .\nProof. i) is a consequence of the isomorphism H i (p*\u03bb) \u2243 H i (\u03bb)(1) \u2297Stp ,\nsee [A80b, Theorem 2.5] (valid for all \u03bb \u2208 X, i \u2208 N). Here Stp =\nH 0 ((p\u22121)\u03c1) is the Steinberg module. Moreover, ii) can also be deduced\nfrom this result, see [A07, Corollary 2.7].\n\u0003\nRemark 3.1. More generally, if \u03bb \u2208 X with H i (\u03bb) 6= 0, then \u2200\u03bc \u2208\npr * \u03bb \u00b1 Xpr with r \u2208 N, H i (\u03bc) 6= 0.\nProof. If \u03bc \u2208 pr * \u03bb \u2212 Xpr , this is [A07, Prop.2.6]. If \u03bc \u2208 pr * \u03bb + Xpr ,\nwe argue as in [A07, 2.7]: by the Serre-duality H N \u2212i (\u2212\u03bb \u2212 2\u03c1) 6= 0.\nThen \u2200\u03b7 \u2208 Xpr , 0 6= H N \u2212i (pr * (\u2212\u03bb \u2212 2\u03c1) \u2212 \u03b7). It follows from the\nSerre-duality again that\n0 6= H i (\u2212(pr * (\u2212\u03bb \u2212 2\u03c1) \u2212 \u03b7) \u2212 2\u03c1) = H i (pr * \u03bb + \u03b7).\n\u0003\nWe shall also need the following proposition obtained by the translation functors mentioned in Section2 . Let A be an alcove, s the\nreflection in one of the walls of A and denote by \u03b8s the corresponding\nwall crossing functor. We will denote by As the alcove adjacent to A\n6\n\n\fover the s-wall.

This gives non-vanishing H 4 in the alcoves marked 4 in Fig. 3.\nProposition 3.2.iib) then implies that H 4 is also non-zero on the walls\nbetween these alcoves (we see from Figure 2 that the necessary H 5 vanishing needed to apply Proposition 3.2.iib) is indeed satisfied). By\nProposition 3.2.iii) we get also non-vanishing H 4 in the alcoves marked\n\u25e6, and via Proposition 3.2.iib) also on the walls between them.\nBy Proposition 3.1.i) we have vanishing cohomology at all special\npoints on the wall between chamber w and chamber tz. Proposition\n3.3.i) then gives vanishing H 4 in the alcoves marked \u00d7 in Fig. 3 (for\nalcove Aw\n11 we apply Proposition 3.3.iii) with F equal to its longest\nwall and then apply Proposition 3.2.ii). For the other alcoves we apply\nProposition 3.2.i) to the alcove itself). Note that the short wall does\nnot have a special point in its closure!\nNow Proposition 3.2.iii) allows us to deduce H 4 -vanishing in all alcoves above the alcoves marked \u00d7 (we say that an alcove A\u2032 is above\nthe alcove A iff there is a sequence of adjacent alcoves A < As1 <\nAs1 s2 < * * * < As1 s2 . . . sr = A\u2032 as in Proposition 3.2.iii)).\n5\nw\nProposition 3.4 gives H 4 (Aw\n4 ) 6= 0 because H (A4 ) 6= 0.

In the second sequence the\nsw\nsw\nsw\nweights of Q and C are F6/8\n+ p\u03b1 and F6/8\n+ 2p\u03b1. We have H \u2022 (F6/8\n+\n6\nsw\n5\nsw\np\u03b1) = 0 by Proposition 3.5.i) whereas H (F6/8 + 2p\u03b1) = 0 = H (F6/8 +\n\n9\n\n\f2p\u03b1) by the results in Section 2.

By Proposition\n3.2.iii) we then have vanishing H 4 also for all alcoves above either Aw\n1\nor Aw\n7.\nThis completes the description of the vanishing behavior of H 4 in the\nintersection of P2 with the chambers t, y and w, and on the facettes\nbetween them by Proposition 3.2.iib). In particular, we record \"exw\nceptional\" vanishing H 4 (F3/4\n) = 0 in contrast to a statement in [A81,\nSection 5], cf. also [H], by marking \u00d7 on the wall.\n4.2.

First we get the non-vanishing of\nH 4 in the alcoves marked 4 and then in the alcoves marked with \u25e6.\nBy Proposition 3.2.iib) H 4 is also non-zero on the facettes between\nthese alcoves. Next we locate those special points on the wall between\nchamber z and chamber sw at which H 4 vanishes and where moreover\nthe method in Proposition 3.3 ensures vanishing in the cones above\n10\n\n\fthem. We indicate this by marking \u00d7 on the bottom alcoves in these\ncones. As H 5 (Azi ) 6= 0, i = 10, 11, 12, Proposition 3.4 gives us that H 4\nis non-zero in these alcoves. Then Proposition 3.2.ii) ensures that H 4 is\nlikewise non-zero in the adjacent alcoves corresponding to i = 13, 14, 8\nand 9. Non-vanishing in Az8 in turn implies for the same reason nonvanishing also in Az7 and Az9 . We have marked all these alcoves with \u2666\nin Fig. 4.\nz\ntz\nWe now observe that by Proposition 3.5 we have H j (F11/13\n) \u2243 H j+1 (F11/13\n)=\n0 for j \u2265 4.

It follows via Proposition 3.2.iib) that H vanishes on\nAz15 (which we therefore mark with \u0007) as well as on all alcoves above\nit (Proposition 3.2.iii)).\n\nConsider now the exact sequences coming from Proposition 3.5.ii)\ntz\nz\nH 4 (V ) \u2192 H 5 (F11/8\n) \u2192 H 4 (F11/8\n) \u2192 H 5 (V )\n\nand\nH 4 (C) \u2192 H 4 (V ) \u2192 H 3 (Q) \u2192 H 5 (C) \u2192 H 5 (V ) \u2192 H 4 (Q)\ntz\ntz\nwith C = Q = F11/8\n+ p\u03b2.

It follows that H 4 (V ) =\nz\ntz\n0 = H 5(V ), and hence H 4 (F11/8\n) \u2243 H 5 (F11/8\n) = 0. Then H 4 (Az8 ) \u2243\nz\n)\u2243\nH 5 (Az11 ) by Proposition 3.2.

We mark this alcove \u0007 in Fig. 6 and have vanishing H 3\nin all alcoves above it.\n\nWe claim that H 3 (Ax22 ) 6= 0. To see this consider the \u03b1-sequences in\nProposition 3.5.ii)\nH 1 (At22 ) \u2192 H 2 (V ) \u2192 H 3 (Ax22 ) \u2192 H 2 (At22 )\nand\nH 2 (V ) \u2192 H 1 (Q) \u2192 H 3 (C).\nThe weights of C and Q are {Ax22 + jp\u03b1 | j = 1, 2, 3}. We know\nH 3 (Ax22 + p\u03b1) = 0. Also by Proposition 3.5.i) and by Kempf we have\nH 3 (Ax22 + 3p\u03b1) \u2243 H 2 (t * (Ax22 + 3p\u03b1)) = 0 = H 3(Ax22 + 2p\u03b1);\nH 3 (Ax22 + 3p\u03b1) = H 3 (At20 ) \u2243 H 2 (A20 ) by Proposition 3.5.i)\n= 0 by Kempf\n= H 3 (A13 ) = H 3 (Ax22 + 2p\u03b1) by Kempf again.\nIt follows that H 3 (C) = 0, and hence we obtain an epi H 2(V ) \u0589\nH 1 (Q). Likewise, as H 2 (At22 ) \u2243 H 1 (A22 ) = 0 and as H 1 (At22 ) \u2243\nH 0 (A22 ) both by Proposition 3.5.i), we obtain an exact sequence H 0 (A22 ) \u2192\nH 2 (V ) \u2192 H 3 (Ax22 ) \u2192 0. Moreover, we have an exact sequence\nH 0 (Q\u2032 ) \u2192 H 1 (Ax22 + p\u03b1) \u2192 H 1 (Q),\nwhere the weights of Q\u2032 are Ax22 + 2p\u03b1 and Ax22 + 3p\u03b1. As Ax22 + 3p\u03b1 is\nnon-dominant it follows that H 0 (Q\u2032 ) \u2243 H 0 (Ax22 + 2p\u03b1) = H 0 (A13 ). On\n14\n\n\fthe other hand, the \u03b1-sequences in Proposition 3.5.ii) yields an exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 H 0 (Ax22 +2p\u03b1) \u2192 H 1 (Ax22 +p\u03b1) \u2192 H 0 (s*(Ax22 +p\u03b1)) \u2192 H 1 (Ax22 +2p\u03b1)\nwith H 0 (Ax22 + 2p\u03b1) = H 0 (A13 ), H 1 (Ax22 + 2p\u03b1) = H 1 (A13 ) = 0, and\nH 0 (s * (Ax22 + p\u03b1)) = H 0 (A14 ). Now we use the observation in Proposition 3.6 that H 0 (A14 ) has composition factor L(A6 ) while H 0 (A13 ) does\nnot. It follows that H 1 (Ax22 + p\u03b1), and hence also H 1 (Q) and H 2 (V )\nhave composition factor L(A6 ). As H 0 (A22 ) does not have composition\nfactor L(A6 ) again by [A86], we conclude that L(A6 ) is a composition\nfactor of H 3 (Ax22 ) proving our claim.\nIf p = 7, as A13 , A14 and A22 do not live in the Jantzen region, [A86]\ndoes not directly apply. One can, however, compute the multiplicity\nof L(A6 ) in H 0(A13 ), H 0 (A14 ), H 0(A22 ) using the G1 T -version of the\nLusztig conjecture, G1 the Frobenius kernel of G, which holds thanks\nto [JCJ], by recalling\nX\n\u02c6\n[\u2207(A)\n: L\u0302(\u03bd)][L(\u03bd 0 ) \u2297 \u03c7(\u03bd 1 )[1] : L(C)],\n[H 0 (A) : L(C)] =\n\u03bd\u2208X\n\nP\nwhere \u03bd = \u03bd 0 + p\u03bd 1 with \u03bd0 \u2208 Xp and \u03bd 1 \u2208 X, \u03c7(\u03bd 1 ) = i (\u22121)i H i (\u03bd 1 ),\n\u02c6\nand [\u2207(A)\n: L\u0302(\u03bd)] is the multiplicity of the G1 T -irreducible L\u0302(\u03bd) of\n1T\n\u02c6\nhighest weight \u03bd in the G1 T -composition series of \u2207(A)\n= indG\nB1 T (A)\nwith B1 the Frobenius kernel B.\nIt follows from the exact sequence (2.1) that also the alcoves Ax18 ,\nAx15 , Ax21 , and Ax19 have non-vanishing H 3 and they have been\nmarked accordingly in Fig. 6.\nAx16 ,\n\n6.

Beyond p2 -alcoves for p = 7\n9. The quantum case\nAs in the introduction we let Uq denote the quantum group of type\nG2 at a root of unity q \u2208 C. More precisely, we start with the generic\nquantum group Uv of type G2 over the field Q(v), v being an indeterminate. The generators in Uv are denoted Fi , Ei , Ki\u00b1 , i = 1, 2. We\nchoose the enumeration such that the indices 1 and 2 correspond in the\nnotation of the previous sections to the short simple root \u03b1 and the\nlong simple root \u03b2, respectively. Then we set A = Z[v, v \u22121 ] and let UA\n25\n\n\fdenote the Lusztig A-form in Uv , see e.g. [L90]. Considering C as an\nA-algebra via the specialization v 7\u2192 q we then define Uq = UA \u2297A C.\nThis construction makes sense for all non-zero q \u2208 C but for our purpose the interesting case is when q is a root of unity. So for us q \u2208 C\nwill always denote a primitive root of 1 of order l > 5 and we assume\n(l, 6) = 1.\nWe have a triangular decomposition Uv = Uv\u2212 Uv0 Uv+ with Uv\u2212 , Uv0\nand Uv+ , being the subalgebras generated by the F 's, K's, and E's,\nrespectively. There is a corresponding decomposition Uq = Uq\u2212 Uq0 Uq+ .\nFollowing the convention in [APW91] we set Bq = Uq\u2212 Uq0 and denote\nby Hq0 the induction functor from integrable Bq -modules to integrable\nUq -modules. This is a left exact functor and we denote its i-th right\nderived functor by Hqi , i \u2208 N. Setting X = Z2 each \u03bb \u2208 X defines a\n1-dimensional Bq -module which we also denote \u03bb and then the Hqi (\u03bb)'s\nare quantized counterparts of the line bundle cohomology studied in\nthe previous sections. For details we refer to [APW91].\nNow all the methods and techniques from Sections 2-3 apply in this\ncase as well. In addition to [APW91] we refer to [APW92], [AW] which\nwe need for non prime power l, and [A03]. These allow us to describe\ncompletely the vanishing behavior for Hqi (\u03bb) for all i \u2208 N and all \u03bb \u2208 X.\nThe results are completely the same as those described in Figures 2-11\nwith the only difference being that p should be replaced by l and there\nare no upper bounds on \u03bb (i.e., the condition \u03bb \u2208 P2 is not relevant in\nthe quantum case). So we can summarize this as\nProposition 9.1. The vanishing behavior of the cohomology modules\nHqi (\u03bb) of the quantum algebra is given by Fig. 9 with all alcoves being\nl-alcoves and with the figure extended to the whole plane.\nReferences\n[A79] Henning Haahr Andersen, The first cohomology of a line bundle on G/B,\nInv.
