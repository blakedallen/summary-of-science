HST imaging of the quasar (Boyce et al.\n1996; Magain et al. 2005) revealed a 1.7\u2032\u2032 double optical system containing HE0450\u22122958 and\na neighbouring galaxy, separated by a projected distance of 7 kpc1 . The quasar/galaxy system is a bright IRAS source (de Grijp et al. 1987) with a total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity\nof LFIR = 1 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 . Due to the relatively poor spatial resolution of IRAS (5\u2032 ) compared\nwith the small quasar/galaxy separation, it has never been definitively established whether\nthe FIR emission arises from HE0450\u22122958, the neighbouring galaxy, or some combination\nof both. The total host galaxy light across the system, excluding AGN emission, has been\nestimated to be about 6L\u2217 (Boyce et al. 1996).\nHE0450\u22122958 shot to the forefront of controversy about a year ago when Magain et al.\n(2005, hereafter M05) found evidence for a quasar whose host galaxy was undetected down\nto a sufficiently interesting limit. M05 estimated a black hole mass of \u2248 8 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 for\nHE0450\u22122958, by assuming sub-Eddington accretion and 10% radiative efficiency. Then,\nusing the Magorrian relation between black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity\n(Magorrian et al. 1998; McLure & Dunlop 2002), they predicted an absolute magnitude of\n\u221223.5 \u2264 MV \u2264 \u221223.0 for the host galaxy. However, careful deconvolution of the HST images\nfailed to detect a host galaxy associated with HE0450\u22122958 to a limit of \u221221.2 \u2264 MV \u2264\n\u221220.5; five to sixteen times fainter than predicted. This intriguing result quickly revived\nthe decade-old debate over the reality of naked quasars (Bahcall et al. 1994), leading to a\nflurry of theoretical papers describing various scenarios for ejecting black holes from their host\ngalaxies during violent mergers (Hoffman & Loeb 2006), and the implications of such violent\nevents for future gravity wave detectors (Haehnelt et al. 2006). More recently Merritt et al.\n(2006) argued that HE0450\u22122958's black hole mass could be an order of magnitude smaller,\n1\n\nWe assume a flat \u039b-dominated cosmology with H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nleading to a host galaxy luminosity of MV \u2248 \u221221, and therefore quite consistent with the\nupper limit derived from the HST images.\nM05 attributed all of the FIR emission to thermal radiating dust grains associated with\nthe companion galaxy 7 kpc from HE0450\u22122958. However, there remains the possibility of\na dusty (optically obscured) host galaxy associated with HE0450\u221229582 . Radio continuum\nemission from galaxies is a good tracer of star formation, and is not obscured by dust. To\nthis end, we observed HE0450\u22122958 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).\nIn this paper, the results of the ATCA imaging campaign are presented, along with a reanalysis of archival VLA and VLT data. We find that whilst the radio emission from the\nHE0450\u22122958 system is energetically dominated by star formation activity, a fraction of\nthe radio emission must be driven by a pair of low-luminosity radio lobes and a radio core.\nThroughout this paper we define the HE0450\u22122958 system to mean the quasar/galaxy pair,\nand unless otherwise stated we refer to HE0450\u22122958 itself as simply the quasar.\n\n2.\n\nObservations & Results\n2.1.\n\nATCA\n\nWe observed a field centred on HE0450\u22122958 with the ATCA during 2006 April. The\nstandard continuum correlator configuration was used which consists of two frequency windows, each with 128 MHz of bandwidth separated into 32 spectral channels, allowing dual\nfrequency observations. We chose RFI-free parts of the 6 and 3 cm bands and centred our\nfrequency windows at 6208 and 8640 MHz accordingly. The most extended array configuration was used which has a maximum baseline of 6 km and translates into a spatial resolution\nof order 4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 at \u221229\u25e6 declination.\nHE0450\u22122958 was observed for 12 hours on two separate occasions. Flux density calibration was achieved to within 5% uncertainty, based on a short observation of the ATCA primary flux calibrator PKS B1934\u2212638. We corrected our observations for atmospheric phase\nfluctuations by intermittedly observing the strong, unresolved quasars PKS B0451\u2212282 and\nPKS B0454\u2212234 each for 2 minutes every other 30 minutes throughout the 12 hour observations. Data analysis was performed using the standard miriad procedures for centimetre\n2\n\nA nearby analog of an optically obscured host galaxy is Markarian 231, a Seyfert 1 quasar with a\nmassive, compact (radius \u223c 450 pc) molecular disk fueling a spectacular, but heavily obscured, starburst\n(Downes & Solomon 1998).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nobservations as outlined in the users' guide3 .

The high\nsurface brightness region about 0.5\u2032\u2032 west of the quasar - aptly named the blob - is also\ndominated by ionised emission lines and has no strong continuum. There is a foreground\nG-type star located north-west of the quasar, and a complicated looking companion object\nwith the spectral characteristics of a starforming galaxy, to the south-east. Overlaid on the\nHST image are the flux-density contours of the 8640 MHz radio continuum image produced\nwith natural weighting of the visibilities. Clearly, C1 is coincident with the quasar and C2\nis associated with the companion galaxy, although it it is appears offset (in projection) by\nabout 0.5\u2032\u2032 . Although C3 lies remarkably close in projection to the foreground star, it is almost certainly unrelated to it. Stellar radio emission is very rare and typically only detected\nfrom hot OB associations (Bieging et al. 1989) and symbiotic stars (Seaquist et al. 1984).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- ATCA 6208 MHz image (robust=0 tapering) of the HE0450\u22122958 system with\ncontours of the same image overlaid.

The quasar and star, shown as point sources in the image, are saturated.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n2.2.\n\nVLA\n\nHE0450\u22122958 was observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) for 9 minutes during\n1990 July 6 in the AB configuration at 1500, 4800 and 8400 MHz (AH0406). We retrieved\nthese data from the VLA archive and analysed them using the runvla task which is now\nimplemented in the aips data reduction software. The task is a pipeline routine written by\nLorant Sjouerman (NRAO, Socorro) for the purpose of reducing VLA archive data.\nThe triple structure observed in the ATCA images is unresolved in the VLA 1500 MHz\nimage (angular resolution of 6\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032\u2032 ) but the integrated flux density is consistent with the\nflux density in the NVSS catalogue (Condon et al. 1998) and therefore constrains variability\non 3\u20136 year timescales. At 8400 MHz, only the quasar is confidently detected, with a flux\ndensity of (0.6 \u00b1 0.2) mJy, compared to the ATCA flux density of (1.2 \u00b1 0.05) mJy for the\nquasar (C1). The discrepancy between the VLA and ATCA flux densities can be explained\nby the factor of seven difference in the spatial resolution between the two datasets, and\nimmediately implies that 50% of the radio continuum emission at the position of the quasar\nis extended on spatial scales of greater than about 3 kpc. Such extended emission is unlikely\nto be due to AGN emission, and is most likely from star formation activity associated with\nthe host galaxy; we return to this in \u00a73.\nThe 4800 MHz VLA data (shown in greyscale in Figure 3) verify the triple radio structure\nobserved in the ATCA images; C1 and C2 are not separately resolved, but C3 is resolved\nwith a flux density of (230 \u00b1 115) \u03bcJy beam\u22121 . The poor signal-to-noise of the data preclude\nany further analysis of this dataset. Deeper VLA observations will be crucial for us to further\nto explore the spatial distribution of the radio emission in detail.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- VLA 4.8 GHz greyscale image overlaid with ATCA 8640 MHz contours. The\ncontour levels are the same as those given in Figure 1. The VLA restoring beam size is\nshown as the filled ellipse inside the ATCA beam in the bottom left corner.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n2.3.\n\nVLT spectroscopy\n\nThe HE0450\u22122958 system was observed with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in\nNovember 2000, using the FORS1 instrument in Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode\nwith three medium resolution grisms (G600B, G600R and G600I) and covered the wavelength range from 3500-9000\u00c5. One slitlet was centred on the quasar itself, and the slit\nposition angle was aligned along the star-quasar-galaxy axis shown in Figure 2. In order\nto separate the quasar nucleus from the diffuse surrounding emission, a PSF correction was\napplied to the dataset using a method developed for the spatial deconvolution of spectra\n(Courbin et al. 2000), based on the MCS deconvolution technique for images (Magain et al.\n1998). Spectroscopic processing details are given in M05.\n\n3.\n\nStar formation in HE0450\u22122958\n\nWhat is the nature of the observed radio continuum emission? We have detected a\nkilo-parsec scale triple linear radio structure centred on a quasar. Is it dominated by AGNrelated emission (core, jets, lobes, hotspots) issuing out from the quasar itself? Or, given the\nlarge FIR luminosity associated with the HE0450\u22122958 system, could the radio emission be\nenergetically dominated by star formation activity from both the quasar's host galaxy and\nthe nearby companion? And, if the system is dominated by star formation, then what is the\norigin of the western radio component (C3), not associated with any optical counterpart?\nIn \u00a73.1-\u00a73.3, we will show that the HE0450\u22122958 system obeys the far-infrared to radio\ncontinuum correlation for normal (i.e. non-AGN) galaxies, and that the quasar's radio\nemission has a steep spectral index and is resolved out in long-baseline interferometry data.\nTogether, these three conditions strongly favour the radio emission from the HE0450\u22122958\nsystem being dominated by star formation activity.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe far-infrared to radio continuum correlation\n\nThere is a very tight correlation between the far-infrared (FIR) and radio continuum\n(RC) emission from normal (ie. non-AGN) galaxies (Condon 1992). While the actual mechanism driving the FIR-RC correlation is still uncertain, this does not diminish the importance\nof the empirical relationship. It is generally accepted that the fundamental ingredient is star\nformation: the FIR component is due to thermal radiation from dust grains which absorb the\noptical/far-UV starlight and re-radiate it in the infrared regime, whereas the radio continuum component arises from magnetic fields with synchrotron radiating relativistic electrons\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nrelated to the star formation activity (see also Figure 4).\nIf the HE0450\u22122958 system obeys the FIR-RC correlation, there is a good chance that\nmost of its radio continuum emission is dominated by star formation processes, rather than\nmore powerful AGN emission from the central quasar. As mentioned in \u00a71, due to the\nrelatively low angular resolution of the existing IR observations (from IRAS), it is currently\nnot possible to separate the FIR component associated with the quasar position from that\nassociated with the neighbouring galaxy. However, we can constrain the nature of the quasar\nemission by measuring the location of the integrated quasar/galaxy system on the FIR-RC\ncorrelation (also see Cram et al. 1992; Roy et al. 1998).\nWe use the form of the FIR-RC correlation derived from 1809 infrared selected galaxies\nfrom the IRAS 2 Jy catalogue4 by Yun et al. (2001, hereafter Y01),\nlog L1400 = (0.99 \u00b1 0.01) log L60\u03bcm + (12.07 \u00b1 0.08),\nwhere\nlog\n\n(1)\n\nL1400\nS1.4\nD\n+ log\n,\n\u22121 = 20.08 + 2 log\n\u22122\nMpc\nJy\nWm Hz\n\n(2)\n\nD\nS60\u03bcm\nL60\u03bcm\n= 6.014 + 2 log\n+ log\n,\nL\u2299\nMpc\nJy\n\n(3)\n\nand\nlog\n\nwhere D is the source distance. Substituting S60\u03bcm = (650 \u00b1 52) mJy (De Grijp et al.\n1987) into Equation 1 yields log L1400 = (23.80 \u00b1 0.23). This is consistent - but at the lower\nlimit - with the observed value of 24.08 \u00b1 0.02 from Equation 2 with S1400 = (9.5 \u00b1 0.5) mJy\nfrom the NVSS catalogue (Condon et al. 1998). The position of the integrated HE0450\u22122958\nquasar/galaxy system on the FIR-RC correlation for a subset of the most FIR luminous\ngalaxies from Y01 is shown in Figure 4.\n\n4\n\nIt makes sense to compare HE0450\u22122958 with an IRAS selected sample because HE0450\u22122958 was itself\ninfrared selected.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The FIR-RC correlation for the subset of galaxies in Y01 with log L60\u03bcm > 11 L\u2299\n(crosses) and for HE0450\u22122958 (triangle). The solid and dashed lines correspond to the\nformal fit to the FIR-RC correlation given in Equation 1. The three sources lying well above\nthe FIR-RC correlation are examples of sources in the IRAS 2 Jy sample with an excess of\nradio continuum emission from an AGN.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nSince 53% of the radio continuum emission from the HE0450\u22122958 system originates at\nthe position of the quasar, and since the quasar/galaxy system obeys the FIR-RC correlation,\nthis suggests that approximately 53% of the FIR emission arises at the quasar position, and\nis powered by star-forming activity from its surrounding host galaxy. This could explain\nwhy HST failed to detect the host galaxy: it is simply heavily obscured by the dust from\na luminous (LFIR = 5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 ) infrared galaxy, with an implied star formation rate of\norder 50 M\u2299 year\u22121 (Condon 1992). This seemingly large star formation rate is typical for\nlocally observed luminous infrared galaxies (Dunne et al. 2000) and infrared bright quasars\n(Cram et al. 1992).\nDue to the small, but finite, dispersion in the FIR-RC correlation, a scenario in which\nsome fraction of the radio continuum emission from the HE0450\u22122958 system is due to AGN\nactivity is certainly possible; it is not uncommon to find AGN and star formation activity\nin the same system. However, AGN emission cannot be the dominant process contributing\nto the radio continuum emission of the HE0450\u22122958.\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectral Index considerations\n\n8640\nTable 2 lists the values of \u03b16208\nfor C1 (quasar), C2 (companion) and C3. A combination\nof low signal-to-noise and proximity of the two frequencies means that our estimates of\n8640\nfor both C2 and C3 have large associated uncertainties. However, we have measured\n\u03b16208\n\u03b1 = \u22121.2 \u00b1 0.2 for C1 (the quasar), which does rule out a flat-spectrum AGN component\n(typically the radio continuum emission from a compact AGN core is flatter than \u22120.5).\nThe observed spectral index is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission either\nfrom star formation or extended low-luminosity AGN structures like compact steep-spectrum\njets and/or lobes. Steep radio spectral indices are typical of the cores of Seyfert galaxies\n(for example de Bruyn & Wilson 1978; Ulvestad & Wilson 1984, 1989; Morganti et al. 1999;\nRush et al. 1996).\n\n3.3.\n\nLong baseline interferometry\n\nHE0450\u22122958 was included in a sample of Seyfert galaxies observed with the now defunct 275 km single baseline Parkes-Tidbinbilla real-time interferometer (PTI; Norris et al.\n1988, Roy et al. 1994). At 2300 MHz, the PTI was only sensitive to structures smaller\nthan 0.1\u2032\u2032 , and therefore perfectly suited to probe compact radio continuum emission from\nthe nucleus of Seyferts and quasars. HE0450\u22122958 was observed with the PTI (two snap-\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nshots of the uv -plane) in 1987, 1990 and 1991 (Roy et al. 1994, 1998). The quasar was not\ndetected down to 3\u03c3 = 2 mJy at 2300 MHz. Using the observed radio spectral index of\n6208\n\u03b18640\n= \u22121.2 \u00b1 0.2 (see \u00a72), this means that <0.6 mJy of the radio continuum emission at\n6208 MHz is contaminated by an AGN core; this upper limit is a factor of three smaller than\nthe total radio continuum emission observed from C1. The lack of compact radio continuum\nemission down to these limits implies that C1 is resolved on scales of & 400 pc. Coupled to\nthe good fit to the FIR-RC correlation (\u00a71) these long baseline constraints also support a\nstar formation origin for the bulk of the quasar's radio continuum emission, arising from its\nunderlying host galaxy.\n\n4.\n\nAGN core and jet emission\n\nThe bulk of the radio continuum emission from the HE0450\u22122958 system arises from\nstar formation activity at the position of the quasar (C1) and the companion galaxy (C2).\nThis in itself is an interesting result: it is direct evidence for a host galaxy associated with the\nquasar. However, the ATCA radio images (confirmed by the VLA archive images) show an\nasymetric, almost-linear, triple radio structure with a projected size of \u223c20 kpc. Although\nC1 and C2 can both be identified with optical counterparts, and therefore understood in\nterms of star formation, C2 is not perfectly coincident with the companion galaxy, and C3\nhas no associated optical counterpart. A full description of the HE0450\u22122958 system must\ninclude C3 and an explanation for the slight offset between C2 and the companion, so there\nis something plainly missing from the pure star formation interpretation. The linearity of the\nthree radio components suggests the presence of low-luminosity jets similar to those observed\nin Seyfert galaxies, or radio-quiet quasars. In this case, the AGN core is centred on C1 (the\nquasar), and C2 and C3 would be low-luminosity radio lobes, or poorly resolved jets.\nIn \u00a73.1, we mentioned that whilst the total radio continuum emission is dominated by\nstar formation, the system would still obey the FIR-RC correlation if a fraction was due\nto AGN processes. The integrated radio continuum emission of the system is 3.4 mJy at\n6208 MHz. At this frequency, C3 is associated with 0.4 mJy of flux density which we now\nattribute to the western radio lobe. We associate an equal contribution of 0.4 mJy to lobe\nemission at C2. In addition, a maximum 0.6 mJy can be associated with AGN core emission\nfrom C1 (see \u00a73.3). In total, up to 41% of the total radio continuum emission from the\nsystem can be attributed to an AGN contribution. This maximum estimate translates into a\n1400 MHz radio luminosity of order 1 \u00d7 1024 W Hz, typical of low-luminosity Seyfert or FR I\nradio sources.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n5.\n\nExtended emission line regions\n\nWe have reanalysed the VLT spectroscopic data presented in several previously published papers (M05, Merritt et al. 2006). Figure 5 shows the 2D spectra around the [O iii]\u03bb5007\nlines, where the point sources (star and quasar) have been subtracted from the original spectra and then artificially added with an increased resolution at the appropriate position; this\nwas done to disentangle the various diffuse components. As expected, the star, galaxy and\nquasar all show continuum emission. However, there are also at least three separate emission line regions with no detectable continuum: one between the quasar and galaxy (labelled\nEmission 1 in Figure 5), one between the star and the quasar (Emission 2), and a high surface brightness region (the blob) about 0.5\u2032\u2032 west of the quasar. Emission 1 and the blob are\nboth detected in the HST optical image shown in Figure 2, but Emission 2 is not detected\npresumably due to the ACS sensitivity (Letawe, private communication). Velocity structure\nis quite evident in the spectral profile of Emission 1.\nExtended emission line regions are typically found aligned along the radio axes of powerful radio galaxies (McCarthy et al. 1987; Chambers et al. 1987; McCarthy 1993; van Breugel et al.\n1998). In many cases there is very good evidence that the alignment is caused by the interaction of the radio jets with gas clouds in the interstellar medium; the jets shock-ionise\nthe clouds along their path (e.g. Dickson et al. 1995; Fosbury et al. 1998; Tadhunter et al.\n2000) and in some cases induce gravitational cloud collapse, which can trigger star formation\n(Dey et al. 1997; van Breugel & Dey 1993; Croft et al. 2006). In other cases, the emission\nline regions are dominated by photoionisation by the AGN (illumination). No doubt it is\noften a combination of all of these that produce the alignment effects we observe.\nIn Figure 6, a BPT (Baldwin et al. 1981) diagnostic diagram has been constructed showing the [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 versus [O ii]\u03bb3727/[O iii]\u03bb5007 line ratios for the various emission\nline regions shown in Figure 5. Such a diagram is a useful way to separate photoionisation\nby AGNs from photoionisation by HII regions; AGNs have systematically larger [O iii]\u03bb5007\nline intensities for a given [O ii]\u03bb3727/[O iii]\u03bb5007 ratio. Clearly the blob, and regions 1 and\n2 from Figure 5 are being ionised by AGN activity and not star formation. However, it is\nnotoriously difficult to use diagnostic diagrams to actually separate AGN illumination from\nionisation by radiative shocks from AGN jets (Dopita & Sutherland 1995), because they\noccupy a similar parameter space in the diagrams (see Inskip et al. 2006; Tadhunter et al.\n2000 for recent some diagnostic diagrams of the extended emission line regions around radio\ngalaxies). We are, therefore, unable to confidently distinguish between the AGN illumination and shock ionisation based on the diagnostic plot alone. However, given the good\nspatial coincidence between the radio structure and the emission line clouds, we favour the\nshock+precursor ionisation scenario triggered by jet-cloud interactions (Dopita & Sutherland\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n1995). Higher resolution radio images, along with optical integral field spectroscopy would\nbe an excellent way to to explore the spatial distribution of the jets/lobes with the emission line gas in more detail in order to confidently determine the origin of the radio-optical\nalignment effect in the HE0450\u22122958 system.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The 2D VLT spectra from M05, around the [O iii]\u03bb5007 doublet emission lines.\nSee the text for details.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 versus [O ii]\u03bb3727/[O iii]\u03bb5007 line ratios for the various\nsources in the HE0450\u22122958 system. The solid line is the Baldwin et al. (1981) fit for\nphotoionisation by HII regions. This figure indicates that the blob, quasar and emission line\nregions 1 and 2 are photoionised by the AGN, whereas the companion galaxy lies within the\nparameter space of pure shock-heated galaxies, albeit at the lower limit and close to the HII\nregion line.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nWhat about the companion galaxy, which appears to be (in projection) physically associated with the eastern radio lobe? In Figure 6 the companion galaxy is located within the\nparameter space of pure shock-heated galaxies (Baldwin et al. 1981; Dopita & Sutherland\n1995), albeit at the lower limit and close to the HII region line. It is likely that shocks created by the passage of the radio jet/lobe can explain the location on the diagnostic diagram.\nThe physical coincidence between the radio lobe and the companion galaxy is strong evidence\nfor large scale jet-induced star formation. This would be analogous to the star formation recently detected in the lobes of Seyfert galaxies (Xanthopoulos et al. 2006) and the discovery\nof a SCUBA source coincident with the lobe of a powerful radio galaxy (Ivison et al. 2002).\nThe higher resolution observations we proposed above, are of course essential to verify a\njet-induced star formation scenario for the companion galaxy.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nThe main conclusions of this paper are:\n1. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we have resolved a triple linear radio continuum structure associated with the HE0450\u22122958 quasar/companion galaxy\nsystem at z = 0.285.\n2. The radio emission is dominated by star formation activity from the quasar's host\ngalaxy. This is the first evidence for a host galaxy in the HE0450\u22122958 quasar, and\ncontradicts any suggestion that it is a 'naked' quasar.\n3. We also find clear evidence for low-luminosity radio lobes, analogous to those of Seyferts\nor radio-quiet quasars.\n4. The brightest radio component is coincident with the quasar, and is energetically dominated by star formation activity from its associated host galaxy. Some fraction of the\nradio continuum emission may be associated with an AGN core, but this is less than\n30% of the total radio emission detected at the position of the quasar.\n5. The second brightest radio component is physically associated with the companion\ngalaxy located 7 kpc from the quasar. The emission is a combination of a low-luminosity\n(eastern) radio lobe, typical of Seyfert or radio-quiet quasars, and star formation activity from the companion galaxy itself.\n6. The third, and faintest, radio component has no associated optical counterpart, and is\ninterpreted as the counter (western) radio lobe.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n7. Highly ionised optical emission line regions are resolved along the radio axis, extending\nacross the entire radio structure. The ionisation mechanism is most likely due to\nradiative shocks by the passage of the propagating jets that interact with existing\ngas clouds in the interstellar/intergalactic medium. However, a part of the extended\nemission line region could be AGN illumination from the quasar core.\n8. The companion galaxy is physically associated with the eastern radio lobe, shows clear\nsigns of star formation activity, and has ionised emission lines consistent with pure\nshock models. Taken together, we favour a scenario in which the companion is the\nresult of large-scale jet induced star formation.\n\nHigh resolution, deep VLA and VLBI radio observations are needed to explore the nature\nof the radio emission in more detail. Spectropolarimetry and optical/near-IR integral field\nspectroscopy on the extended emission line regions will constrain the ionisation mechanism\n(be it AGN ilumination or shocks from jet-cloud interactions). Planned high resolution\nobservations of the CO J=1\u20130 emission line in the system are expected to shed more light\non the distribution of the large expected molecular gas reservoir fuelling the star formation\nactivity in the quasar host and the companion galaxy.\nThe Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope which is\nfunded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed\nby CSIRO.
