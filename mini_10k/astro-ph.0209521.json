MLAPM (Multi-Level\nAdaptive Particle Mesh) is one of the most efficient serial codes available on the cosmological \"market\" today. As part of Swinburne University's role in the development of the Square Kilometer Array, we are\nimplementing hydrodynamics, feedback, and radiative transfer within\nthe MLAPM adaptive mesh, in order to simulate baryonic processes relevant to the interstellar and intergalactic media at high redshift. We will\noutline our progress to date in applying the existing MLAPM to a study\nof the decay of satellite galaxies within massive host potentials.\n\nMLAPM (Multi-Level Adaptive Particle Mesh) is a publicly available Ccode1 for evolving a set of N -particles under their mutual gravity within\na cosmological framework. The code solves Poisson's equation on a hierarchy of nested grids; the entire computational volume is covered by\none cubic domain grid, while refined regions are of arbitrary shape and\nadjusted to the actual density field at each major time-step in order\nto follow the real distribution of particles at all times. An example of\nMLAPM in action is shown in Figure 1. The left panel shows all parti-\n\n1 http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/MLAPM/\n\n1\n\n\f2\ncles in a slice of thickness 3h\u22121 Mpc through the simulation box. The\nright panel indicates the adaptive grids used with that particle distribution. In addition to this spatial refinement, an additional adaptive\ntime-stepping is implemented in the latest version of MLAPM. The time\nstepping is restricted so that we ensure that particles are advanced at\nleast a pre-specified fraction of the cell in which it resides, but never\nmore than half the cell spacing.\n\nFigure 1\n\nParticle distribution (left) vs. MLAPM adaptive grids (right)\n\nMLAPM has proven to be one of the fastest single-CPU N -body-codes\non the market today (Knebe et al. 2001). We have begun an ambitious\nprogram of cosmological and galactic dynamical simulations using MLAPM\n- preliminary results on the latter are presented here.\nThe signatures of hierarchical galaxy formation are evident in the observed substructure seen in various phase-space projections of the Galactic halo. The clearest such signature is that of the spectacular stream of\nstars associated with the currently disrupting Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.\nSecondary streams have also been observed locally (Helmi et al. 1999)\nand in the halo of M31 (Ibata et al. 2001). Ibata et al have shown\nthat such streams are extremely useful tools for constraining the shape\nof a halo's gravitational potential well. In the case of the Milky Way,\nIbata et al. concluded that our halo was necessarily very close to spherical (under the assumption of a static axisymmetric potential). We have\nadopted MLAPM to extend this analysis, but now are using live potentials.\nFour low resolution (1283 particles; 64h\u22121 Mpc box size) simulations\nwere run initially, and ten halos selected sampling a range of triaxialities.\nThese halos were then re-simulated at higher resolution (5123 particles).\nThe effective mass per particle was 106 M\u2299 , with a force resolution\nof 1h\u22121 kpc in the dense regions. An adaptation of the Bound Density\n\n\fCosmology on a Mesh\n\n3\n\nMaxima (BDM, Klypin & Holtzman 1997) algorithm was used to identify\nand trace substructure evolution in these high resolution simulations.\nOur preliminary results show that triaxiliality is a fleeting measure\nof the Galactic potential - the live potential and active substructure\nmitigates (somewhat) the usefulness of this measure. One simulated\nstream is highlighted here in Figure 2. A detailed analysis of the phasespace dissolution of these structures is currently underway.\n\nFigure 2\n\nDisrupted satellite in halo potential\n\nWe have begun implementing hydrodynamics within MLAPM, and aim\nto have a publicly available version of Hydro-MLAPM in 2004-2005. The\nexisting grid structure will be used as a base for this implementation,\nas the grid provides a natural structure on which to solve the relevant\nequations.\n\nReferences\nHelmi, A., White, S., de Zeeuw, T., Zhao, H. 1999, Nature, 402, 53\nIbata, R., Lewis, G., Irwin, M., Totten, E., & Quinn, T. 2001, ApJ, 551, 294\nKlypin A.A., Holtzman J., astro-ph/9712217\nKnebe A., Green A. & Binney J.J. 2001, MNRAS, 325, 845\nMLAPM is available at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/MLAPM/\n\n\f"}
