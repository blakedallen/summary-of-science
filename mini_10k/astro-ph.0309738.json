A method for measuring the substructure present in the lens using observations\nat multiple wavelengths is demonstrated to be very effective and independent of many of the\ndegeneracies inherent in previous methods. The magnification ratios of the QSO's narrow line\nregion (NLR) and broad line region (BLR) are measured and found to be disagree with each\nother and with the published radio and mid-infrared magnification ratios. The disagreement\nbetween the BLR ratios and the radio/mid-infrared ratios is interpreted as microlensing by\nstars in the lens galaxy of the BLR. This implies that the mid-infrared emission region is larger\n< 0.1 pc in size. We find a small difference in the shape of\nthan the BLR and the BLR is \u223c\nthe H\u03b2 line in image A when compared to the other images. We consider this difference too\nsmall and symmetric to be considered strong evidence for rotation or large scale infall in the\nH\u03b2 emission region. The disagreement between the radio/mid-infrared ratios and the NLR\nratios is interpreted as a signature of substructure on a larger scale, possibly the missing small\nscale structure predicted by the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Extensive lensing\nsimulations are performed to obtain a lower limit on the amount of substructure that is required\nto cause this discrepancy as a function of its mass and the radial profile of the host lens. The\nsubstructure surface density is degenerate with the radial profile of the host lens, but if the\nexpectations of the CDM model are taken into account certain radial profiles and substructure\nsurface densities can be ruled out. A substructure mass scale as large as 108 M\u2299 is strongly\ndisfavored while 104 M\u2299 is too small if the radio and mid-infrared emission regions have the\nexpected sizes of \u223c 10 pc. The standard elliptical isothermal lens mass profile is not compatible\nwith a substructure surface density of \u03a3sub < 280 M\u2299 pc\u22122 at the 95% confidence level. This is\n1 Hubble\n\nFellow\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\n4 \u2212 7% of the galaxy's surface density (depending on which image position is used to evaluate\nthis). The required substructure surface density at the required mass scale is high in comparison\nwith the present expectations within the CDM model. Lens mass profiles that are flatter than\nisothermal \u2013 where the surface density in dark matter is higher at the image positions \u2013 are\ncompatible with smaller quantities of substructure.\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we present observations of the lensed quasi-stellar object (QSO) Q2237+0305\nand use them to address fundamental questions concerning the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)\ncosmological model and in addition to investigate the internal structure of the QSO. The CDM\ncosmological model has recently experienced great successes in predicting the distribution of\ngalaxies and the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. However, there remain some\nchallenges to this model on the scale of galaxies themselves. Simulations of structure formation\nwithin this model predict that a high level of substructure will survive tidal disruption within\nthe large dark matter (DM) halos that surround galaxies. N-body simulations indicate that\nthere should be plentiful subhalos in a L\u2217 galaxy's halo, with masses above 107 M\u2299 \u2013 smaller\nmass scales are presently inaccessible due to limitations in resolution. If these subhalos contained\nstars, there would be significantly more dwarf galaxies in the Local Group than are seen (Moore\net al. 1999; Klypin et al. 2001).\nVarious solutions to this \"dwarf satellite problem\" have been proposed. In particular, if\nthe dark matter is warm (WDM) rather than cold then the small scale structure is reduced\nwhile the large scale (successful) properties of the standard paradigm are preserved. Another\nexplanation for the absence of observable substructure is that the star formation in these small\nDM halos was inhibited by ionizing radiation at an early stage in the universe (e.g. Somerville\n(2002); Bullock, Kravtsov, & Weinberg (2000); Dong, Murray, & Lin (2003)). In this case the\nsubstructure does exist, but is invisible. Metcalf & Madau (2001) showed that this substructure\ncould be detected in gravitational lenses. There is already some evidence in support of the\nneed for substructure to explain the relative magnifications in strong lenses; disentangling its\nsignature from other (also interesting) effects is the goal of this paper.\nThe extraction of useful information from QSO lens systems has long been hampered by\nuncertainties and ambiguities related to modeling the lens' mass distribution. This has been\nthe case for estimates of the Hubble parameter from lensing and it has necessitated long term\nmonitoring in the optical to detect microlensing. Recently it has become an important issue\nin testing the CDM cosmological model by detecting the dark substructure predicted in this\nmodel. From the positions of the images and lens galaxy of a 4-image lens system, a parametric\nsmooth mass model for the lensing galaxy and halo can be computed (including external shear),\nalong with predictions for the three independent flux ratios. Measuring deviations between the\npredictions and the (differential-reddening-corrected) observed fluxes in real lenses has been used\nto argue that substructure is present in almost all QSO lens systems (Metcalf & Madau 2001;\nChiba 2002; Metcalf & Zhao 2002; Dalal & Kochanek 2002). Some substructure has long been\nconsidered a possible explanation for inconsistencies in the observed flux ratio of B1422+231.\nMao & Schneider (1998) argued that in this case the source quasar is near a cusp caustic in the\nlensing map and because of this the sum of the magnifications of the three closest images should\nbe close to zero for any smooth lens model. B1422+231 and all other known cusp caustic lenses\nviolate this relation. It is unclear how far this argument can be taken since the proximity of the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nsource to the caustic depends on the lens model itself (see Gaudi & Petters 2002) and stellar\ndisks may cause the relation to be violated even very close to the cusp (Brada\u010d et al. 2003).\nIt is also unclear what mass or size the substructure needs to be for this argument to break\ndown, i.e. how to measure properties of the substructure from violations of these relations. In\nany case, most lens systems do not have such advantageously located source quasars and the\npredicted flux ratios can be strongly dependent on the parametric lens models used while the\nimage positions are degenerate. Any estimate of the mass fraction in substructure that uses a\nsimple lens model e.g. Dalal & Kochanek (2002) is highly suspect. The observational technique\nused here largely avoids this important problem, as well as the problems of intrinsic variability\n(on the timescale of the typical time-delay between images), differential extinction, scattering in\nthe radio and microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy.\nThe 4-image gravitational lens Q2237+0305, also known as Huchra's lens after its discoverer\n(Huchra et al. 1985), has been a testbed for studying microlensing for many years. The QSO\nat redshift z = 1.69 is lensed by a single spiral galaxy at z = 0.03 which makes it especially\nadvantageous for this. The microlensing of a QSO was first observed by Irwin et al. (1989) in\nthis system and since then it has been extensively monitored in the optical (Wo\u017aniak et al. 2000).\nQ2237+0305 has also been instrumental in studying the structure of the QSO itself. Constraints\non both the size of the optical emission region (Yonehara 2001; Wyithe et al. 2000b) and\nthe mid-infrared emission region (Wyithe, Agol, & Fluke 2002) have been established through\nmicrolensing. In this paper critical measurements of the H\u03b2 broad line and [O III] narrow line\nratios are added to the existing information on this lens which allows us to draw conclusions\nabout the size of the broad line emission region (BLR) and the size of structures in the lens.\nIn what follows, if it is not otherwise explicitly stated, the cosmological model is taken\nto be a flat one with a cosmological constant of \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and a Hubble parameter of\nHo = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The lensing results are often expressed in term of the critical surface\ndensity defined as \u03a3\u22121\ncrit (zs , zl ) = 4\u03c0GDl Dls /Ds where Ds is the angular size distance to the\nsource, Dl is the distance to the lens and Dls the distance between the lens and the source. For\nthe case of Q2237+0305 \u03a3crit = 9.8 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 pc\u22122 in the above cosmology. The surface density\nin units of the critical density is denoted \u03ba.\nIn the next Section the general method of spectroscopic gravitational lensing and its special\nadvantages are outlined. In Section 3 the data reduction is described. The measurements of line\nstrengths and magnification ratios are described in Section 4 along with their comparison with\npreviously published measurements in other wavelengths. These measurements are interpreted\nin Section 6 in terms of the structures that could be responsible for them. A summary and\ndiscussion are given in Section 7.\n2.\n\nThe Method of Spectroscopic Compound Lensing\n\nTo remove much of the lens model ambiguities, a different method for detecting substructure\nlensing was proposed by Moustakas & Metcalf (2003) which avoids the problems arising from\ndegeneracies in lens models, differential reddening in the optical images and scattering in the\nradio. This method utilizes the prediction that different emission regions of the QSO differ\nin size and thus should be magnified to differing degrees if substructure on a small scale is\npresent. Comparing the magnification ratios in different wavelengths provides information on\nthe structure of the QSO and the small scale structure of the lens that is independent of the\nlarge scale structure of the lens galaxy and halo. To describe this method we will first briefly\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nreview what is known about the anatomy of a QSO.\n2.1.\n\nsketch of QSO anatomy\n\nThe variability timescales of different spectroscopic features, and the time delays between\nthem, have been used to establish the size and structure of different emission regions within\nthe unified model for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and QSOs (c.f. Antonucci 1993). The basic\npicture consists of a supermassive black hole (Mbh > 106 M\u2299 ) in the core, surrounded by an\naccretion disk, which produces the nearly flat-spectrum continuum light. The continuum flux\nvaries on very short timescales, less than a day, and so must be very compact (around 100 AU\nor \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc). It is also known to be microlensed in the case of Q2237+0305 which puts\nan upper limit of 2,000 AU on its size (Yonehara 2001; Wyithe, Webster, & Turner 2000a;\nWambsganss, Schneider, & Paczynski 1990). Beyond that, there are permitted lines such as the\nBalmer-series lines that are very broad (vFWHM > 103 km s\u22121 ) due to gravitationally-induced\nmotions. The characteristic size of this broad line region (BLR) apparently scales with the\nintrinsic luminosity of the host QSO (and therefore with the mass of the central black hole;\nKaspi et al. 2000; Wandel 1999), such that in luminous QSOs (as opposed to, e.g., Seyfert 1's),\nthe size of the BLR is on the order of six light-months (or \u223c 0.1 pc). According to long-term\nstudies of QSOs, the typical (rest-frame) flux variations in the QSO continuum are on the order\nof 10\u201370% (though occasional fluctuations as high as \u223c 50\u00d7 are possible; Ulrich, Maraschi, &\nUrry 1997), while the BLR variations are smaller by a factor of 2\u20134 (Maoz et al. 1994).\nThe narrow emission lines (e.g. [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007) do not vary in flux significantly over the\ntime span of several years (Kaspi et al. 1996). For this reason, they have been used for calibration\nin long-term spectroscopic monitoring observations of low redshift QSOs for reverberation\nmapping experiments, by which the time delays between features of different ionization states\nmay in principle be used to map all the components that make up QSOs (Peterson 1993).\nPhoto-ionization arguments and cases where the narrow line region (NLR) is imaged directly,\nindicate that the size of the NLR extends out to 100-1000 pc and is approximately proportional\nto the square root of the luminosity in narrow lines.\nA QSOs thermal emission in the mid-infrared is believed to come from a dusty torus that\nextents from a few parsecs to tens of parsecs. This belief largely comes from modeling the\nradiation transfer (for example Andreani, Franceschini, & Granato 1999) although recently a\nmore direct lower limit on the size of this emission region has been made by comparing the\nmicrolensing of the optical continuum emission and the mid-IR (Wyithe et al. 2002).\nA quasar can emit in the radio on a large range of size scales. The central region of a radio\nloud QSO is usually resolved by VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) into a core and jet,\nor a core and lobes on a scale of \u223c 10 pc. The size of the core is limited from below by the\nCompton surface brightness limit which is generally in the 10 \u03bcac range.\n2.2.\n\nthe differential magnification ratio (DMR)\n\nSimulations show that if a few percent of the lens surface density is contained in substructures\nof mass \u223c 107 M\u2299 then deviations of \u223c 0.1 mag between the magnifications of the NLR and the\nBLR will be commonplace (Moustakas & Metcalf 2003). In addition, for the case of Q2237+0305\nthe microlensing scale or Einstein radius for ordinary stars is particularly large so if the BLR is\nsmall it could be microlensed. Our goal here has been to measure the NLR and BLR ratios in\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nlens Q2237+0305 and determine if substructure is evident.\nTo quantify our results we define the differential magnification ratio (DMR)\nDMRAB \u2261\n\nB\nB\nf AL fBL\n\u03bcA\nN L \u03bcBL\n= N\n.\nA\nB\nA\nB\n\u03bcBL \u03bcN L\nfBL fN L\n\n(1)\n\nwhere superscripts denote the image and subscripts the QSO emission region. The magnification\nis \u03bc and the observed flux is f . Note that the DMR is independent of the intrinsic QSO\nluminosity, the intrinsic NLR/BLR ratio and if the NL and the BL used are close enough in\nwavelength it will be essentially independent of extinction. In addition, we will define the\nB\nquantity \u2206N L/BL \u2261 \u22122.5 log(\u03bcBLR /\u03bcN LR ) so that \u2206A\nN L/BL \u2212 \u2206N L/BL is a measure of the\nDMR in magnitudes. If there is no substructure all three independent DMRs in a 4\u2013image\nlens should be close to one (a small deviation from one is possible because of the host galaxy's\ninfluence on the NLR; see Section 6.2). More generally the DMR can be used to compare any\ntwo measurements of the magnification ratios to see how well they agree.\n3.\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe J-band (\u03bbc \u223c 1.25 \u03bcm) spectroscopy of Q2237+0305 was performed with the Cambridge\nInfrared Panoramic Survey Spectrograph CIRPASS Parry et al. (2000) at the f/16 focus on the\n8-m Gemini-South telescope, at Cerro Pachon in Chile. CIRPASS is a near-infrared fiber-fed\nspectrograph, connected to a 490 element integral field unit (IFU). The variable lenslet scale\nwas set to 0.\u2032\u2032 36 diameter, and the hexagonal lenslets are arranged in the IFU to survey an\napproximately rectangular area of 13.\u2032\u2032 0 \u00d7 4.\u2032\u2032 7. The detectors is a 1k\u00d71k Hawaii-I HgCdTe\nRockwell array. CIRPASS can operate in the range 0.9 \u2212 1.8 \u03bcm, and a 400l/mm grating was\nused which produced a dispersion of 2.25 \u00c5/pix. The grating was tilted to place the wavelength\nrange \u03bb\u03bb11300 \u2212 13600 \u00c5 on the detector, covering most of the J-band transmission window\nout to the atmospheric absorption between the J- and H-bands. A filter at 1.67 \u03bcm blocked\nout redder wavelengths to reduce the dominant near-infrared background contribution. The\ndetector pixels do not quite critically sample the spectral resolution (unresolved sky lines have\nFWHM=1.7 pix), and the resolving power is \u03bb / \u2206\u03bbFWHM = 3500.\nThe observations were made on the night of UT 2002 August 10 during the Director's\ndiscretionary time instrument commissioning/IFU-demonstration science on Gemini-South.\nThe observations spanned the airmass range 1.2 \u2212 1.8. A total of 3 hours integration was\nobtained, split into individual integrations of 30 min per pointing, although the array was read\nnon-destructively every 10 min (i.e., 4 times per pointing, including an initial read of the bias\nlevel). Each of these 'loops' comprised 10 multiple\nreads of the detector, which were averaged to\n\u221a\nreduce the readout noise (30e- per read) by 10. These averages of each loop were subtracted\nfrom the average of the next loop of non-destructive reads, to form 3 sub-integrations of 10 min\nat the same telescope pointing. Comparison of these sub-integrations enabled cosmic ray\nstrikes to be flagged, and a combined frame of 30 min was produced by summing the three\nsub-integrations, while masking pixels affected by cosmic rays. The seeing was \u2248 1.\u2032\u2032 0 FWHM,\nand the long axis of the IFU was set to 130 deg East of North. Windshake affected the guiding,\nand 2 loops were lost through severe trailing of the images. These were removed from the\nsubsequent data reduction, so the final science integration was 160 min. In total, six overlapping\npointings were surveyed, each covering all of the Einstein cross: positions were not repeated to\nimprove background subtraction and reduce the impact of bad pixels. We 'nodded' the target\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nfrom the top (A) to the bottom (B) of the IFU every 1800 s, and introduced a small sub-dither\nof 2 lenslets between integrations. An initial subtraction of sky and dark current was performed\nusing this beam-switching: for each exposure at location A, the average of the three spectra\ntaken at B was subtracted, and vice versa. There was no overlap of the extended emission from\nthe Einstein cross between positions A and B (a chop of \u2248 8\u2032\u2032 ). Known bad pixels were also\ninterpolated over at this stage.\nThe 490 fibers span the 1k detector, with 2 pixels per fiber. A lamp was used to illuminate\n10 calibration fibers immediately before the observations, in order to accurately determined\nthe position of the fibers on the array and to focus the spectrograph at the desired wavelength\nrange. There is significant cross-talk between adjacent fibers and we use an optimal-extraction\nroutine2 (Johnson et al. 2003) to determine the spectrum of each fiber, for each pixel on the\narray solving the contribution of flux from adjacent fibers (knowing their relative positions).\nImmediately after the science integrations, spectral flat fields were obtained (exposures of the\nilluminated dome), and these were also optimally-extracted and their average flux normalized\nto unity. The extracted science data was then flat-fielded through division by the extracted\nnormalized dome lamp spectra, calibrating the response of each individual fiber.\nWavelength calibration was achieved with an Argon arc lamp observed following the science\nexposures. Again, the individual fiber spectra were optimally extracted, and for each fiber a\ncubic fit was performed to the centroids of 40 arc lines, leaving rms residuals of 0.2 \u00c5. The 490\nfiber spectra stacked on the slit were rectified (mapped to the same wavelength) with a 5th order\npolynomial transformation in x and y. This transformation was applied to the beam-switched,\nextracted, flat-fielded science frames. A higher-order background subtraction was then applied\nto this rectified data, to remove sky residuals from the beam switching caused by variation in\nthe OH-line intensity.\nThe rectified, background-subtracted 2D spectra (with the dimension of wavelength and\nfiber number along the slit) were then converted to 3D data cubes, arranging the fibers into\ntheir physical positions in 2D on the sky, with wavelength being the third dimension. Because\nof the hexagonal close packing arrangement of the lenslets, alternate rows are offset by half a\nlens: in making the cubes this was accounted for by regridding each lenslet by two in the spatial\ndimensions (i.e. each lenslet is 2x2 sub-pixels of diameter 0.\u2032\u2032 18). These six data cubes (from the\nsix pointings of the telescope) were registered, shifting them spatially to the same location on\nthe sky, and combined with a percentile clipping algorithm, rejecting bad pixels and residuals\nfrom cosmic ray strikes discrepant by more than 3 \u03c3.\nFlux calibration was obtained through observations of the standard star HIP036096\n(V = 8.89 mag, type B2V), taken on the same night at similar airmass. The standard star\nspectrum was reduced in the same way as the science data, and the total flux found by summing\n4 \u00d7 4 lenslets (1.5 arcsec diameter). Normalizing through division by this spectrum corrected for\nthe severe atmospheric absorption at > 1.33 \u03bcm. The total effective throughput was determined\nto be \u223c 8 per cent on the sky for the middle of the J-band.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- The full CIRPASS spectrum at the center of QSO image A (above) and at the center of the lens galaxy (below).\nThe broad H\u03b2 line at 13097 \u00c5 is clear in the QSO spectrum and in the galaxy spectrum there is only a hint of it. It is also clear\nthat the continuum is steeper in the QSO and the Fe II \"bulge\" is apparent in the QSO spectrum near 12300 \u00c5. The prominent\nline at 1.28 \u03bcm is Pa\u03b2 from the calibration star.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nData Analysis\nline strengths\n\nTo extract the line fluxes we fit a local continuum spectrum plus lines to each \"spixel\" in the\nimage (i.e. the spectrum from each fiber corresponding to a unique spatial position). Example\nspectra from two spixels are shown in Figure 1. We are interested in the relative integrated flux\nwithin a line which should not depend critically on modeling the line shapes in detail. (In fact\nit is possible that microlensing might affect the line profile in detail without greatly affecting\nthe total flux in the line in which case a fit to a smoother line profile would be preferable.\nSee Section 6.1.1.) We start by fitting a local continuum that is linear in wavelength and a\nsimple first order Edgeworth expansion3 to the H\u03b2 line in the nine spixels around image A, the\nbrightest image. This fit is done only in the range 12658\u201313424 \u00c5 (4706\u20134990 \u00c5 in QSO rest\nframe) to avoid the Fe II complex as much as possible. The shape of the H\u03b2 line in image A is\nthen used as a template for all the other spixels. The spectrum at each spixel in the array is fit\nto a continuum level and slope along with a line strength. The result is displayed in Figure 3.\nIn fitting the line and continuum several sky lines are masked out and along with the calibration\nstar's Pa\u03b2 at 12820\u00c5, see Figure 1. The shape and level of the Fe II complex varies greatly\nbetween QSOs and is thus very difficult to subtract (see Boroson & Green 1992). In all cases\nhowever Fe II contributes very little to the flux between 12658 \u00c5 and the H\u03b2 line. There are\nthree broad Fe II lines blueward of H\u03b2 at \u03bb\u03bb4924, 5018, 5169 \u00c5 which are not identified in our\n2 The\n3 The\n\nCIRPASS data reduction software is available from http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/ \u0303optics/cirpass/docs.html\n\nEdgeworth expansion is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution where each addition term effects a higher moment\nof the distribution. The first order expansion has a skew.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Map of the integrated flux between 11305.1 \u00c5 and 13613.7 \u00c5(or 4203 \u00c5to 5061 \u00c5in the QSO's rest-frame). The\nimage is in the CIRPASS spixel coordinates which are rotated clockwise 50\u25e6 from \u03b4\u2013R.A. coordinates. The squares mark the\napertures used to measure the QSO fluxes as discussed in \u00a7 4.2. The conventional image labels are shown next to each aperture.\nNote that image B (the right most) is not prominent above the lens galaxy. The pixels are 0.18\u2032\u2032 in the horizontal direction\nand 0.156\u2032\u2032 in the vertical (the difference is due to the hexagonal packing of the CIRPASS lenslets). The two spots below the\ncentral image are caused by cosmic rays.\nspectra. The 4924 \u00c5 line could conceivably cause us to overestimate the slope of the continuum\nand underestimate the strength of H\u03b2. We can estimate the maximum effect this could have by\nnoting that the height of this line is always below the height of the \u03bb\u03bb4450 \u2212 4700 Fe II bulge\nwhich we can measure. This contribution to the H\u03b2 strength is rather small. We include it in\nthe H\u03b2 flux errors instead of attempting to subtract it.\nThe full\u2013width\u2013half\u2013maxima (FWHM) of the H\u03b2 lines are 4100, 3500, 3600 and\n3600\u00b1100 km s\u22121 for images A, B, C and D respectively - all consistent with each other except\nimage A. The skewnesses of the images are all small and consistent with each other. There is\nfurther discussion of the change in the shape of the H\u03b2 between images in Section 6.1.1.\nThe sky absorption near the 5007\u00c5 and 4959\u00c5 [O III] lines is large and sky line subtraction\nmakes any fitting difficult. The 4959\u00c5 line is not detected anywhere in the field possibly\nbecause of confusion with the Fe II \u03bb4924 line. The 5007\u00c5 line is very close to a subtracted sky\nline to its redward side, and to its blueward the noise introduced by flux calibration and high\nsky absorption is too large to accurately fit a continuum. To avoid these difficulties we fit the\ncontinuum in the range 13278\u201313469\u00c5 (independently of the continuum used in the H\u03b2 fit) then\nsubtract this from the sum of the flux in 7 pixels (in wavelength) on top of the line (rest frame\n5006-5010\u00c5). This avoids the sky line. No fitting of the line shape is done.\nThe maps of line strengths in Figure 3 show the four QSO images distinctly and residual\nflux from the lens galaxy is at a low level although there are bridges between 3 of the images\nin [O III] at a level of 25% of the maximum. These connections go through the center of the\nlens galaxy and no arc connecting images is detected. The [O III] NLR is consistent with being\npoint-like at our resolution, \u223c 0.6\u2032\u2032 in contrast to the C III] \u03bb1909 NLR observed by Mediavilla\net al. (1998) which shows an arc connecting images A, D and B.\nTo evaluate the statistical errors in our line strengths we take the part of the IFU field\nthat is well away from the lens system where we expect no line emission and go through the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- A map of H\u03b2 and [O III] 5007 at the redshift of the QSO with the continuum subtracted spixel-by-spixel. The four\nQSO images are more distinct than in the total flux, Figure 2. Image B is clearly apparent here and the lens galaxy is not.\nsame continuum and line fitting procedure. We find that the average line strengths in 1036\nsuch spixels is consistent with zero showing that there is no significant bias in our line fitting\nalgorithm. The variance in the line strengths among these spixels is used as the statistical noise.\nThere should be no significant signal-dependent noise since the data is dark current limited.\n4.2.\n\nmeasuring magnification ratios\n\nTo find the total flux within a line coming from an image we must choose an aperture\naround each image. We use two choices for apertures. First we use square boxes five half-lenses\nwide (0.90\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.78\u2032\u2032 ) centered on the QSO image positions. This is close to the expected size of\nthe PSF. The peak in the emission is found to be the center of image A and the other image\npositions are set using the high precision HST relative image positions (Kochanek et al. 2000).\nThese are shown in Figures 2 and 3. To make certain that we are capturing all the flux from\neach image we also extend the apertures as shown in the figures. The differential magnifications\nare given in Table 1 along with the separate NLR and BLR flux ratios. The errors given are the\nstatistical errors discussed above. There is little change to the DMRs when the apertures are\nextended further without overlapping each other signifying that leakage of flux outside of the\napertures is not significant.\nBecause the DMRs depend on which image is chosen to normalize them the important\nfeatures to look for are the spread in the DMRs, how consistent they are with each other,\nand whether there is one outlier indicating that one particular image is being effected. The\nnormalizing image's DMR \u2013 \u2206 = 0 \u2013 should be included in this comparison. In table 1 image A\nis used to normalize the DMRs. For the other images the DMRs are negative and inconsistent\nwith zero, but they are roughly consistent with each other. This indicates that the BLR in\nimage A is anomalously bright. The simple magnification ratios in the BLR and those in NLR\nare also consistent with each other except those including image A which indicates that the\ndifferential extinction is not large.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nsmall apertures\n\nextended apertures\n\nImage\n\u2206NL/BL\n\u2206NL\n\u2206BL\n\u2206NL/BL\n\u2206NL\n\u2206BL\n\nB/A\n\u22120.82 \u00b1 0.06\n\u22120.23 \u00b1 0.06\n\u22121.06 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22120.74 \u00b1 0.05\n\u22120.31 \u00b1 0.05\n\u22121.05 \u00b1 0.02\n\nC/A\n\u22120.89 \u00b1 0.06\n\u22120.14 \u00b1 0.06\n\u22121.03 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22120.87 \u00b1 0.05\n\u22120.23 \u00b1 0.04\n\u22121.11 \u00b1 0.02\n\nD/A\n\u22120.93 \u00b1 0.05\n0.09 \u00b1 0.05\n\u22120.84 \u00b1 0.01\n\u22120.81 \u00b1 0.05\n\u22120.21 \u00b1 0.04\n\u22121.02 \u00b1 0.01\n\nTable 1:\n\nDifferential Magnification Ratios and Magnification ratios in magnitudes: These are normalized so that\n\u2206A\n=\n0.

The published 1-\u03c3 error bars are shown.\n\n4.3.\n\nContinuum\n\nIt would be useful to compare the BLR and NLR fluxes with the continuum in our data.\nExtracting the QSO continuum flux requires subtracting the lens galaxy contribution and all the\ncontributions from lines. An attempt was made to model the HST NICMOS image of the lens\ngalaxy and degrade it to the PSF of the Gemini/CIRPASS data. We concluded that because of\nwind-shake, the PSF of our data was not well enough characterized to accomplish this to the\naccuracy we would like for this paper.\n5.\n\ncomparison with radio and mid-infrared ratios\n\nTwo of the goals of this work are to eliminate the uncertainty inherent in radio flux ratios\ndue to scattering by ionized gas and to eliminate differential extinction uncertainties inherent in\noptical or near infrared observations. However, it will be shown that in this case these effects are\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nimage\nmid-IR/radio\n\nnarrow line region\nB/A\nC/A\nD/A\n\u22120.42 \u00b1 0.11 0.35 \u00b1 0.15 \u22120.16 \u00b1 0.15\n\nbroad line region\nB/A\nC/A\nD/A\n\u22121.16 \u00b1 0.10 \u22120.53 \u00b1 0.15 \u22120.97 \u00b1 0.14\n\nTable 2:\n\nThe differential magnification ratios comparing the combined radio and mid-IR magnification ratio measurements\nto the NLR and BLR measurements.

To do this and gain more information about substructure in the lens we construct DMRs\nby combining other observations with the NLR and BLR measurements. Since the sizes of the\nradio and mid-infrared emission regions are believed to be intermediate to those of the BLR and\nNLR this can give us additional information about the structure causing the anomalous DMR\nat the expense of these additional uncertainties.\nThe radio fluxes in Q2237+0305 have been measured using VLA (Very Large Array)\nby Falco et al. (1996) at 3.6 cm, and Agol, Jones, & Blaes (2000) have observed it in the\nmid-infrared, 8.9 \u03bcm and 11.7 \u03bcm. Figure 4 shows the DMRs with respect to the radio and\nmid-IR measurements for both the NLR and the BLR. The uncertainties in these measurements\nare considerably larger than those in our line measurements, but important conclusions can\nbe drawn from them. The BLR in image A is anomalously bright with respect to the other\nmeasurements while the NLR in image A is consistent with being magnified to the same\nextent as both the radio and mid-IR. The consistence in the mid-IR and radio ratios is further\ndemonstrated in the left panel of Figure 5. This suggests that the radio and the mid-IR emission\nregions are being lensed by the same structure and thus are similar in size which is in agreement\nwith theoretical expectations, but, to our knowledge, has never been measured directly. It is\nalso seen in Figure 4 and more clearly in the right panel of Figure 5 that both the radio and the\nmid-IR do not agree with the NLR \u2013 the image B NLR is relatively dim and the image C NLR\nis relatively bright. The difference between the largest DMR and the smallest DMR, the spread,\nis 0.77 mag. There is no clear outlier in the DMRs suggesting that the spread is not the result\nof an anomaly in a single image. Table 2 lists the DMRs comparing the combined radio/mid-IR\nwith the NLR and BLR data.\nThe differential colors for the images of Q2237+0305 are in order \u2206E(B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.03,\n\u22120.17 \u00b1 0.03, 0.01 \u00b1 0.03 and 0 (Falco et al. 1999). This implies that extinction would make\nthe NLR in image B relatively dimmer than the others which is the opposite of what is found.\nAlso, the expected magnitude of the extinction is relatively small in comparison to the DMRs\nobserved \u2013 A(1.3\u03bcm)/E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.75 mag for the Milky Way giving a change in the DMR\nbetween images A and B of 0.05 mag. This does not exclude the possibility that the extinction\nis very patchy so that the continuum extinction is not appropriate for the NLR, but the small\ndifferences between the colors of the images argue against this being a large effect.\nThe simplest interpretation of the anomalous DMRs in Figure 5 is that the mid-IR and radio\nemission regions are larger than the BLR and whatever is causing the extra magnification of the\nBLR in image A is too small to significantly change the magnification of the mid-IR, radio or\nNLR. Then there is some larger structures that are causing the NLR ratios to be incompatible\nwith the mid-IR and radio ratios.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.-\n\nThe likelihood functions for differential magnification ratios. In the left panel is the DMR between the mid-IR and\nradio ratios with respect to image A (DMR=0 means the ratio of mid-IR to radio is the same as in image A) using the published\nerrors. All three DMRs are compatible with zero. In the right panel it is assumed that the magnification ratios in mid-IR and\nradio are the same and they combined into one set of measurements. The likelihood function between this measurement and\nthe NLR measurements are plotted. The NLR errors are twice those reported in Table 1 to be conservative. The DMRs of\nimage C and D are consistent with zero, but image B has a low DMR meaning that the radio/mid-IR is anomalously bright\nwith respect to the NLR in this image.\n\n6.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere are three possible factors contributing to the anomalous differential magnification\nratios we observe. Microlensing of the BLR by stars in the lens galaxy could be changing\nits magnification ratios relative to those of the NLR, radio and mid-IR. This is discussed in\nSection 6.1. The size of the NLR could be big enough with respect to the host lens that its\nmagnification differs from that of the other emission regions even without what would normally\nbe classified as substructure. This is ruled out in Section 6.2. Finally, larger scale substructure\n(possibly made of CDM) either in the lens galaxy or along the line of sight is causing the\nmismatch between the NLR and radio/mid-IR magnification ratios. This is termed millilensing\nand is investigated in Section 6.3.\nAn additional consideration that can be immediately ruled out is that the time delay between\nimages is longer than the typical timescale for variations in the source. Any reasonable lens\nmodel for Q2237+0305 gives time delays that are very short, typically less than a day. Recently,\na tentative measurement of the time delay has been made using X-ray observations yielding\n2.7+0.5\n\u22120.9 hours between image A and B (Dai et al. 2003). This is well below the timescale on\nwhich the QSO is expected to vary in any of the wave\u2013bands discussed in this paper.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n6.1.\n\nMicrolensing\n\nQ2237+0305 is exceptional among QSO lens systems in that its lens galaxy is very close to\nus (z=0.03). This makes the BLR particular susceptible to microlensing for two reasons. First,\nthe Einstein radius of the host galaxy in physical units is roughly \u221d Dls Dl /Ds which reaches\nits maximum close to half way to the source. For this reason the images form closer to the\ncenter of the galaxy in Q2237+0305 where the star density is particularly\nphigh. In addition, the\nsize of a star's Einstein radius relative to the size of the source goes as Dls Ds /Dl and so is\nexceptionally large for Q2237+0305. There is ample evidence that the QSO's optical continuum\nis being microlensing in image B of Q2237+0305 (Irwin et al. 1989; Ostensen et al. 1996;\nCorrigan et al. 1991; Wo\u017aniak et al. 2000; Wyithe et al. 2000b). Monitoring has shown that in\nthe optical, image B went from being the second brightest image (hence the name) to being tied\nfor the dimmest image over a two year period. We find image B to be dimmest in the NLR and\nthe BLR. This gives some hint that the BLR magnification is correlated with the microlensing\nof the optical continuum.\nFurther evidence of microlensing of the BLR is in Figure 4 where our data is compared\nto other data. The mid-infrared emission region is believed to be not much larger than the\nBLR. The lack of strong anomalies in the mid-IR/radio DMRs suggests that the substructure\nis very small. In addition, the large anomaly in the BLR/NLR image A DMR implies compact\nand numerous substructures are responsible. Microlensing by stars seems like the most\nstraightforward explanation.\nThe microlensing interpretation is also consistent with theoretical expectations for this\nsystem. An upper limit on the standard deviation\n\u221a of the magnification ratio caused by\n\u03ba\u2217\n\u03b8E (M\u2217 )\n< 3\n(Refsdal & Stabell 1997, 1991)\nmicrolensing for a finite sized source is \u03b4m \u223c\n|1\u2212\u03ba+\u03ba\u2217 |\n\u03b8s\nwhere \u03b8E (M\u2217 ) is the Einstein radius for a star of mass M\u2217 = hM 2 i/hM i , the averaging\nis done over the distribution of star masses, and \u03ba\u2217 is the dimensionless surface density\nin stars. The surface density\nin smoothly distributed\ndark matter is \u03ba \u2212 \u03ba\u2217 . In this case\np\np\n\u03b8E (M\u2217 ) = 0.089 pc/Ds M\u2217 / M\u2299 = 3.63 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2217 / M\u2299 arcsec. Trott & Webster (2002)\nhave modeled the mass distribution of Q 2237+0305 using the QSO image positions and a variety\nof direct observations of the lens galaxy. Their best fit model gives \u03ba \u2212 \u03ba\u2217 \u2243 0.05 and \u03ba\u2217 \u2243 0.04\n< 0.04 pc/R\nat the radius of the images. For a realistic value of M\u2217 = 0.5 M\u2299 this gives \u03b4m \u223c\nNLR\nwhere RNLR is the physical size of the BLR.\nThe size of the BLR in some QSOs and Seyfert galaxies can be estimated using reverberation\nmapping. Combining the radius\u2013luminosity relation and broad line width\u2013luminosity relation of\nKaspi et al. (2000) gives RNLR \u2243 0.03(4108 km s\u22121 /vFWHM )2.58 pc although there is significant\nscatter about this relation. With the H\u03b2 line widths reported in \u00a74 this gives RNLR \u223c 0.05 pc,\nsmall enough that the the observed magnification of image A can be explained by microlensing.\nThe time scale for changes in the microlensing magnification is set by the size of the BLR and\nthe velocity of the stars in the galaxy relative to the image. The BLR is of order a light\u2013month\nin size and typical speeds for the galaxy and rotation of the its disk are \u223c 200 km s\u22121 . This\ngives a time scale of \u223c 100 yr. This is in contrast to microlensing of the visible continuum where\nthe time scale is about 100 times smaller (Wyithe et al. 2000b, 2000a).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.-\n\nComparison of the H\u03b2 line in image A (dark curve) to that in image B (light curve). The line in image A is slightly\nwider than the line in image B. This could be caused by a blending of the emission from the NLR and the BLR combined with\ndiffering magnifications or by microlensing of kinetically distinct regions of the BLR.\n\n6.1.1.\n\nH\u03b2 Line Profiles\n\nSeveral groups have investigated the possibility of detecting microlensing and learning\nsomething about the structure of the BLR through distortions in the profile of the broad lines\n(Nemiroff 1988; Schneider & Wambsganss 1990; Abajas et al. 2002). If the BLR has a coherent,\nlarge scale velocity structure (such as rotation or uniform infall) microlensing could change the\nshape of a broad line in the image that is being microlensed. This effect comes about because\nthe magnification can vary across the image of the source and the emission region for a narrow\nrange of wavelength can be much smaller than the whole NLR. It was generally thought that if\nmicrolensing would have an insignificant effect on the total magnification of the BLR of a bright\nQSO.\nWe find that the H\u03b2 line is wider in image A with respect to the other images. Figure 6\nshows the line in image A and B with the continuum subtracted and normalized so they have the\nsame height. The change is not large and there is no significant evidence that the asymmetry of\nthe lines are different in the different images. In appendix A an upper limit to the contribution\na wavelength dependent component to the magnification is derived. More than half of the\nanomalous magnification in image A must be caused by a magnification that is uniform over the\nvelocity structure of the H\u03b2 emission region.\nThe extra width of the image A H\u03b2 line can be interpreted as either caused by the\nmicrolensing of a small scale velocity structure in the BLR or as a sign that there is a\nnarrow\u2013line component to the H\u03b2 that is not being magnified as strongly in image A as the\nbroad\u2013line component. The microlensing explanation would not in general produce a symmetric\nbroadening like the one we see, but it is possible that it would. We conclude that there is no\nstrong evidence for coherent large scale motion in the H\u03b2 BLR, but that this possibility cannot\nbe ruled out.\nFilippenko (1989) found that the broad MgII \u03bb2798 line had a slightly asymmetric distortion\nin its profile between the different QSO images of Q2237+0305 which could be attributed to\nmicrolensing. It is known that the BLR for high ionization states is significantly smaller than\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- A model of Q2237+0305 with the regions used for measuring the magnification ratios shown.\n\nIn this case the source\nhas a Gaussian profile of size R0.1 = 526 pc (full width for 10% peak surface brightness). The lowest contour is at 1% of the\npeak surface brightness and they go up in intervals of 10%. It can be seen that differences in the \u2206NL/BL 's from zero are not\ncaused by loses outside of the integration regions.\n\nthe H\u03b2 BLR (see Peterson & Wandel 1999, for an illustration of this) thus more susceptible to\nmicrolensing and possibly more coherent in its velocity structure.\n6.2.\n\nNLR size effects\n\nThere are two ways in which the size of the NLR might change the NL/BL ratio between\nimages without substructure. First, if the effective size of the NLR is close to the size of the\naperture used to measure the flux the NLR/BLR ratio will be affected. Because the sizes of the\nNLR are different in each image it is possible some of the flux could leak out of the aperture\ncausing the more magnified images to have lower NLR to BLR ratios. This possibility can be\neliminated by increasing the size of the apertures and seeing in the NLR fluxes go down as is\nthe case for our extended apertures.\nThe second possibility is that the NLR is large enough that the magnification cannot be\nconsidered uniform over the whole image and thus its total magnification will differ from that\nof the smaller BLR. To address this issue we model the lens and the NLR for Q2237+0305 and\nmeasure the ratios in mock data. The lens model consists of a elliptical halo with a power-law\nradial profile, a exponential disk and an external shear. The model reproduces the image\npositions and the radio magnification ratios. The same apertures are used in the simulations\nand with the data. Figure 7 shows an example of one such simulation. We use two models for\nthe surface brightness profile of the NLR \u2013 an exponential and a Gaussian. The Gaussian is\nmeant to represent the case of a NLR with a sharp edge while the exponential is more diffuse.\nThe profile of the NLR of NGC 4151, probably the best studied example in a Seyfert galaxy, is\nroughly exponential although it does show significant irregularities and asymmetries (Robinson\net al. 1994).\nThe size of the NLR in C III] \u03bb1909 was inferred from modeling the arc connecting images\nA, B and D by Mediavilla et al. (1998). They estimate the size of the BLR in this wavelength\nto be 340 \u2212 570h\u22121 pc where this is the total extent of the observed emission. Direct HST\nmeasurements of QSOs in [O III] indicate that the the NLR could be a few kpc in total extent\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- The DMRs with respect to image B are plotted as a function of source size, R0.1 . These are calculated using the lens\nmodel and the extended apertures discussed in the text. The source profile is Gaussian in this example. The hashed regions\nare within 1\u03c3 of the measured values.\n(Bennert et al. 2002).\nFigure 8 shows the results of these simulations along with the observed DMRs. The size of\nthe source is measured by R0.1 which is the radius at which the surface density drops below\n\u22121\n10%. For comparison 1\u2032\u2032 = 24.5h65\nkpc on the source plane and 885h\u22121\n65 pc on the lens plane.\nFor a Gaussian source profile the DMR does not differ greatly from one (or zero in magnitudes)\n<\n< 4 kpc. For a exponential profile the same is true for R\nif R0.1 \u223c\n0.1 \u223c 2 kpc. And when the NLR\nis large enough to change the DMR it is in the opposite direction to the observed A to B DMR.\nWe conclude that the finite size of the NLR could account for the low (but not very low) C to B\nand D to B DMRs, but not for the high A to B DMR.\n6.3.\n\nMillilensing\n\nThe disagreement between the NLR and radio/mid-IR magnification ratios is most easily\nexplained by the presents of substructure with a mass m \u226b M\u2299 . We shall see that the quantity\nof substructure required to make this discrepancy probable makes substructure made of CDM\na more likely explanation than substructure composed of ordinary gas and stars such as dwarf\ngalaxies or globular clusters. To determine the level and properties of the substructure that are\ncompatible the measured DMRs we carry out extensive lensing simulations.\n6.3.1.\n\nsimulations\n\nFor the results that follow, the magnification distributions were calculated using an adaptive\ngrid code. The strategy is to first calculate the image positions, through the lens equation,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\non a coarse grid over the image plane. The deflection angle is found by summing over all the\nsubclumps in this initial region. The grid is then refined to cover smaller regions surrounding\neach of the images. The grid is made finer when the image begins to cover a large fraction of\nthe gridded region. This process is repeated until enough grid points are within the image to\ncalculate its area to better than 1% accuracy. The magnification is then the ratio between this\narea and the original area of the unlensed source.\n>\nIf the substructure is massive ( \u223c\n107 M\u2299 ) it can change the position of the images enough\nthat the contribution of the host lens to the image magnification can change. In addition, a\nsingle one of these large substructures can affect the magnification of more than one image.\nFor these reasons we simulate the whole lens (host lens plus substructure) at once. In this\nway we can measure the positions of the images which become significant constraints on the\nsubstructure when its mass is large.\nCDM simulations predict that most of the substructure at a projected galactic radius of a\nfew kpc will be at a three dimensional radius of a few tens of kpc (Zentner & Bullock 2003). The\nsubstructure will then be distributed fairly uniformly on the scale of the host's Einstein radius.\nFor this reason we do simulations with a constant number density of substructures. We do not\ncharacterize the simulations by the mass fraction in substructure because this can vary by a\nfactor of several between the different images owing to the differences in density at small radii.\nThe substructures are modeled as singular isothermal spheres (SISs) tidally truncated as if they\nare at a distance of 30 kpc from the center of an isothermal galaxy. The lensing is not critically\ndependent on the details of this truncation. All the substructures are of the same mass. In a\nmore theoretically motivated model there would be a distribution of substructure masses, but in\nthis paper we are seeking to put empirical constraints on the substructure mass scale.\n6.3.2.\n\nradial profile degeneracy\n\nThere is a degeneracy between the level of substructure and the radial profile of the host\nlens as discussed in Metcalf (2003). The effect of changing the radial profile is investigated by\nadjusting the host lens model. We start with an elliptical lens model with an \u03ba(\u03c1) \u221d \u03c1\u22121 (where\n\u03c1 in coordinates that are aligned with the axis of the lens is \u03c12 = x21 + x22 /(1 \u2212 \u01eb)2 ) profile that\nfits the image positions very well. This is known as a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) lens\nmodel. We then add a uniform surface density, \u03c3, to the lens and adjust the normalization of\nthe ellipsoidal component so that the image positions do not change. This is always possible\nand has no effect on the magnification ratios, but it does change the total magnification such\nthat flatter profiles have higher magnifications and it changes the time delays such that flatter\nprofiles have shorter time delays. The total magnification is unobservable and the time delay\nhas not been measured for Q2237+0305. These degenerate models are labeled by their effective\nlogarithmic slope, neff , which is related to the the added surface density by neff = (\u03c3 \u2212 1). For\nfurther discussion see Metcalf (2003).\nFor each choice of substructure properties and host lens model we run simulations with three\ndifferent source sizes \u2013 10 pc which is appropriate for the radio and mid-IR emission regions and\nfor the NLR we use 200 pc and 400 pc for all. This size should be viewed as an effective size for\nthe purposes of lensing not the full extent of the NLR which must be larger.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- The probability that the spread in the DMRs, S, will be greater than the observed 0.77 mag, P (S \u2265\n0.77 | \u03basub , neff , m), with substructure mass m = 104 M\u2299 . The different curves are for host lens models with different radial\nprofiles (see Section 6.3.2). The horizontal dotted line marks the 5% level for reference.

These values differ from those in the lens model of Schmidt, Webster, & Lewis (1998) at\nthe 10% level. The neff = \u22121 model is the singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model.\n\n6.3.3.\n\nresults\n\nWe find that the data are best suited to putting a lower limit on the surface density of\nsubstructure as a function of the substructure mass and the host lens profile; this is the most\nrobust and conservative way to treat the data. To quantify this we use the spread statistic. We\ndefine the spread, S, as the difference between the largest DMR and the smallest, including the\nnormalization image's DMR (\u2206 = 0). This statistic is clearly independent of which image is used\nto normalize the DMRs. In the absence of substructure and noise S = 0. As shown in Section 5\nthe measured spread is S = 0.77 mag. We calculate the probability of getting an observed\nspread as large as this or larger given the level of substructure and the noise, P (S \u2265 0.77). This\nis done by Monte Carlo, using the simulations to predict the flux of each image and then adding\nrandom noise. At least 2,000 lensing simulations are calculated for each choice of substructure\nparameters and for each simulation 500 realizations of the noise are made. The results do not\nchange when these numbers are increased. To be conservative we use twice the NLR flux errors\nderived from the data and reported in Table 1.\nFigures 9 through 13 show the probability P (S \u2265 0.77) for different substructure masses.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Same as in Figure 9 only with substructure mass m = 105\n\nM\u2299 .

The cases marked \"> 0.06\" did not reach this limit within the range of surface densities tested, those\nmarked \"\u2013\" appear as though they cannot reach this limit for any \u03basub and those that are blank where not tested because the\nimages tended to merge in too many cases.\n\nFigure 9 is for a mass of 104 M\u2299 . In this case the substructures are not large enough to change\nthe magnification of the NLR and only rarely can significantly change the magnification of the\n10 pc source representing the radio and mid-IR sources. The probability is correspondingly\nlow with none of the models going above 5% probability for \u03basub < 0.06. We consider this\nlow probability unacceptable thus ruling out m = 104 M\u2299 substructure with \u03basub < 0.06 as an\nexplanation. To translate these values into mass fractions Table 3 gives the surface densities at\neach image in the different models.\nFigure 10 shows the probabilities for mass 105 M\u2299 . The probability is larger here than for\n4\n10 M\u2299 , but still not significant unless the host halo is flatter than an SIE. The neff = \u22121\nmodel, the most common assumption in lensing, is ruled out for the range of \u03basub tested.\nOur maximum surface density of \u03basub = 0.06 is still very large compared to the some CDM\npredictions of less than 0.1% at this mass scale (Zentner & Bullock 2003). The neff = \u22120.4 case\nreaches our thresh-hold of 5% at \u03basub = 0.047 making this the lower limit in this case.\nA mass of 106 M\u2299 is investigated in Figure 11. In this case for substructure surface densities\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.-\n\nSame as in Figure 10 only with substructure mass m = 106 M\u2299 .\n\n\u03basub > 0.029 the observed DMR discrepancy occurs more than 5% of the time in all the host\nmodels tested. At the 10% level \u03basub > 0.058 in the most common neff = \u22121 model. For flatter\nmodels this lower limit is reduced significantly. These are more reasonable mass fractions since\n\u03basub = 0.02 corresponds to fsub \u2243 0.05 at image A in the neff = \u22121 model and less in the flatter\nmodels. However, at this mass scale this is still rather large compared to the current CDM\npredictions.\nFigure 12 shows P (S \u2265 0.77) for substructure of mass 107 M\u2299 . In this case the substructure\nis big enough to occasionally shift the image positions by a few tenths of an arcsec. Lens\nmodels for Q2237+0305 using the observed distribution of stars have been very successful at\nreproducing the image positions (Trott & Webster 2002; Schmidt et al. 1998). For this reason\nany substructure cannot change the image position by very much. In Figure 12 limits on the\nallowed shift in image positions are imposed to express this additional constraint. We adopt\na conservative limit of 0.\u2032\u2032 2 as a test. Results with and without the image shift constraint are\nplotted in Figure 12 and it is seen that this extra constraint does not change the lower limits on\n\u03basub . The most striking result displayed in Figure 12 is that the neff = \u22121 is unlikely to produce\nthe observations for any substructure surface density that is reasonable from the prospective of\ncurrent CDM model predictions (\u03basub = 0.06 would be 15% of the mass at image A). In fact,\nP (S \u2265 0.77) does not go above 15% within the range of \u03basub investigated unless neff \u2265 \u22120.4. In\nsome cases we can put an upper limit on \u03basub and they are reported in Table 4.\nFigure 13 shows P (S \u2265 0.77) substructure of mass 108 M\u2299 . Here all the models are ruled\nout at the 90% level and the only way to get above the 95% level is to abandon a limitation\non the shift of the image position which we think is not realistic. High mass substructure\nis not compatible with the observed DMRs because it is not effective in changing the small\nand large scale magnification ratios independently - when it magnifies (or demagnifies) the\nradio and mid-IR images it also magnifies (or demagnifies) the NLR image. This is further\nconformation that anomalous DMRs must be the results of small scale structure and not a large\nscale distortion of the host lens. In addition, the 108 M\u2299 substructure tends to displace the\nimages on the scale of several tenths of an arcsec although this mass range is ruled out even\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Same as in Figure 11 only the substructure mass is 107 M\u2299 and two limits on the shift of the image positions are\nshown. For each neff the lowest curve is for a 0.\u2032\u2032 2 limit and the highest is for no limit. For the neff = \u22121, \u22120.8 and \u22120.6 the\n0.\u2032\u2032 2 limit is indistinguishable from no limit. Note that scale in this plot is not the same as in Figure 11.\nwithout this constraint.\nWe have done these calculations with source sizes of 200 pc and 400 pc representing the\nNLR. Changing the size makes only small changes to P (S \u2265 0.77) at large mass and large neff .\nThese changes do not significantly change the conclusions. For Figures 9 through 13 the NLR\nsource size is set to 200 pc. The lower limits on \u03basub for all the models tested are shown in\ntable 4.\nThe error estimates that have been derived for our observations and those published with\nthe mid\u2013IR and radio observations are crucial for the estimation of the surface density bound. If\nthe errors are underestimated the \u03basub lower bound should be lower. For example, if we increase\nthe radio errors of Falco et al. (1996) by half the \u03basub lower limit in the neff = \u22121, m = 106 M\u2299\nmodel goes from 0.029 to 0.021. Increasing the mid\u2013IR errors (Agol et al. 2000) in this way\nchanges this limit to 0.016. On the other hand if the empirically derived errors on our NLR\nmeasurements are used instead of doubling them the limit is increased to 0.055.\nTo squeeze more out of the data we can also calculate likelihood functions for the substructure\nparameters although this is somewhat less robust then the P (S \u2265 0.77) analysis done above.\nThe likelihood function for set of parameters {\u03basub , neff , m} is given by\nZ\nL(\u03basub , neff , m) = d{DMR} Psub ({DMR}, {x} | \u03basub, neff , m)\n(2)\n\u00d7Pob ({DMRob }, {xob } | {DMR}, {x})\nwhere Pob expresses the instrumental uncertainties which is taken to be a normal distribution.\nUniform prior distributions have been assumed for the parameters. Again the integral is done\nby Monte Carlo.\nFigure 14 shows the likelihoods as functions of substructure mass in several ranges of\nsubstructure surface density. Plotted this way it is clear that the data favors a substructure\nmass of \u223c 106 M\u2299 for fixed \u03basub . Here the errors in the NLR magnification ratios have been\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Same as in Figure 12 except the substructure mass is 108\n\nM\u2299 . None of the models reached above 0.065 probability\n\nthat the DMRs spread will be greater than 0.77 mag.\n\nset to twice those in Table 1 to be conservative. The likelihood functions with the measured\nstatistical errors are shown in Figure 15. The shape of the likelihood function is very similar,\nbut the extreme masses are more strongly ruled out.\nIn summary, the data puts a lower limit on the amount of substructure that is present in\nQ2237+0305. Table 4 gives these limits for the ranges of parameters tested. Given the present\nCDM simulations these limits seems uncomfortably large. With the expected substructure level\nof < 1% of the surface density in subclumps of mass less than 108 M\u2299 the host lens profile as\nsteep as \u03ba(\u03c1) \u221d \u03c1\u22121 is unacceptable. We also find that a substructure mass scale of \u223c 106 M\u2299 is\nmost effective at changing the observed DMRs. Substructure of mass 104 M\u2299 is too small and\n108 M\u2299 is too large. The details of the lower mass limit is dependent on our assumption that\nthe radio and mid-IR emission regions are 10 pc in radius, however to the precision we are now\nconcerned with this should not be a major factor.\nIt has been assumed here that the substructure is within or near the lens galaxy. It is\npossible that the responsible objects are in intergalactic space either in front of or behind the\nlens. Within the CDM model this is less probable, but not improbable. The above constraints\ncan be crudely converted to a redshift z by scaling the substructure mass and surface density\ns \u2212D(z)}\nby a factor of \u03a3crit (zs , zl )/\u03a3crit (zs , z) = D(z){D\nDl {Ds \u2212Dl } . This factor reaches a minimum of 0.6 at\nz = 1.1.\n6.3.4.\n\nThe contribution of known objects\n\nThere are known objects in our galaxies and others which could conceivably be causing the\nobserved anomalies in the DMRs. One possibility is globular clusters. However, the total mass\nin globular clusters around the Milky Way is only \u223c 107 \u2212 108 M\u2299 so their surface density is\ntwo order of magnitude below the lower limits reported here.\nAnother contribution is from Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) of mass \u223c 106 M\u2299 which\nare known to contain most of the H2 gas mass in the Milky Way. The surface density of H2\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.-\n\nThese are the likelihood functions for four ranges of substructure surface density as marked in each panel. The\ncurves are marked in the same way as in Figures 9 through 13 \u2013 solid: neff = \u22121, dotted: neff = \u22120.8, dashed: neff = \u22120.6 and\ndot-dashed: neff = \u22120.4. The limit in the acceptable shift in the image positions is 0.\u2032\u2032 2. The normalization is arbitrary, but all\nthe models are normalized in the same way so that they can be compared between panels. A substructure mass of \u223c 106 M\u2299\nis clearly favored in all cases.\n\nat galactic radius \u2243 1 kpc (where the images in Q2237+0503 form) is only a few M\u2299 pc\u22122 ,\nwell below our lower limits (Blitz 1997). The H2 density in M31 no more than \u2243 5 M\u2299 pc\u22122\nanywhere (Loinard et al. 1999). However, in some galaxies the peak H2 density does exceed our\nlower limit (Helfer et al. 2003). The H2 density is truncated at an inner radius of several kpc.\nThis is believed to be caused by the galactic bar. The same phenomena is seen in other barred\nspirals. In Q2237+0503 the lensing is almost entirely caused by the bulge and bar of the galaxy\nthrough which the images pass (Trott & Webster 2002). For this reason we expect the density of\nGMCs to be well below our limit. In addition, GMCs are not very centrally concentrated, they\nare generally held up by turbulent pressure and have many, much smaller mass, condensations\nsprinkled throughout them. For this reason GMCs make inefficient lenses as compared to the\nSIS model used in Section 6.3.1 through 6.3.3. The GMCs would need more density by a factor\nof a few to reproduce reproduce the lensing observations.\nAnother argument for a small surface density in GMCs is the extinction. By adopting an\nupper limit on the absolute luminosity of the QSO of MB > \u221229 and an upper limit of 20 for\nthe lens magnification (the SIE+shear model predicts 16) an upper limit for the extinction of\nAV < 2.7 mag can be derived (Falco et al. 1999). The extinction in the Milky Way is roughly\nrelated to the hydrogen column density through N (H I) + 2N (H2 ) \u2243 13 AV M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Savage\net al. 1977). Conservatively assuming all the hydrogen is in molecular form this gives an upper\nlimit of N (H2 ) < 18 M\u2299 pc\u22122 which is well below our lower limit on substructure. Falco et al.\n(1999) have argued that the above relation between hydrogen column density and extinction\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.-\n\nThe same as in Figure 14 only the errors for the NLR magnification ratios reported in Table 1 are used instead of\ndoubling them to account for unknown systematic errors. The normalization is arbitrary and different from that in Figure 14.\n\ndoes not hold for some of the lens galaxies they studied in the sense that it over estimates the\ncolumn density which makes our upper limit even more conservative.\nFor the above reasons we do not think GMCs are a likely explanation for the DMR anomalies,\nbut they are probably the largest potential \"background\" and we plan to investigate their lensing\nproperties more thoroughly in the future. For lenses with elliptical galaxies \u2013 the majority of\nQSO lenses \u2013 GMCs are much less likely to be a source of lensing substructure. Analyzing more\nlens systems can definitively rule of GMCs.\n7.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have demonstrated the spectroscopic gravitational lensing method and shown the\nimportance of having high quality data in a large range of wavelength. Using the CIRPASS\ninstrument the magnification ratios of the QSO's narrow lines region and broad line region were\nmeasured. It was found that these do not agree with each other or with the published radio and\nmid-IR magnification ratios. The disagreement between the BLR magnification ratios and the\nradio/mid-IR magnification ratios is interpreted as microlensing of the BLR. This implies that\n< 0.1 pc in size. We find a\nthe mid-IR emission region is larger than the BLR and the BLR is \u223c\nsmall difference in the shape of the H\u03b2 line in image A when compared to the other images. This\ndifference is too small and symmetric to be considered evidence for rotation or large scale infall\nin the H\u03b2 emission region. The disagreement between the radio/mid-IR ratios and the NLR\nratios is interpreted as a signature of substructure. Lensing simulations are performed to obtain\na lower limit on the amount and mass of substructure that is required to cause this discrepancy.\nThe substructure content is degenerate with the radial profile of the host lens, but if the\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nexpectations of the CDM model are taken into account certain radial profiles and substructure\nsurface densities can be ruled out. The substructure mass scale as large as 108 M\u2299 and 107 M\u2299\nis disfavored while 104 M\u2299 is too small given our assumptions about the radio/mid-IR source\nsize. The standard elliptical singular isothermal lens mass profile is disfavored in comparison to\na more flattened profile with the same substructure content.\nAlthough the anomalous differential magnification ratios in Q2237+0305 are very unlikely to\nbe caused by a substructure as large as 108 M\u2299 this does not mean that the mass function of\nsubstructures does not extend up to this mass scale. Large mass substructures could dominate\nthe total mass in substructure and yet be very few in number so that one would expect many\nlenses to be unaffected by them; in other words the shot noise from lens to lens is expected to\nbe large at high masses. If the responsible object is intergalactic and unassociated with the lens\ngalaxy the mass bound is different, but in this case the upper mass bound is more likely to go\ndown then up because the lens galaxy is unusually close to us and not near the minimum of\n\u03a3crit (zs , z).\nIt should be mentioned that flattening the host lens' radial mass distribution generally\nreduces the Hubble parameter as measured by the time delays. The X-ray measurement of the\ntime delay (2.7+0.5\n\u22120.9 hours between image A and B) is tentative (Dai et al. 2003), but it does\nindicate that Q2237+0305 has a near r\u22121 surface density profile if the HST Key Project's value\nfor the Hubble parameter is used (72 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ; Freedman et al. 2001). The fiducial\nSIE+shear model used here gives a time delay of 3.3 hours and the delay is proportional to\nn\u22121\neff as defined in section 6.3.2. In general the measured time delays in other lenses lead to a\nconclusion that either the Hubble parameter is smaller than the above value or the profile is\nsteeper than r\u22121 . Kochanek (2003) has highlighted this as a problem for the CDM model. This\nis an unresolved and intriguing problem which becomes even more so with our results since\nthe steeper the radial profile the more substructure is needed. It could be that in looking for\nsubstructure to confirm CDM we have found too much.\nClearly more lens systems need to be studied in this way to put stronger constraints on dark\nmatter substructure and eliminate systematics. The prospects for improvement are good in this\nrespect since Q2237+0305 is not an ideal system for this work \u2013 the [O III] lines are in a region\nof high atmospheric absorption and because of the proximity of the lens galaxy microlensing\nis enhanced. The situation can be greatly improved with just a few more systems observed in\nnarrow lines and the mid-IR and/or radio. One of the most important systematic uncertainties\nwe encountered is how to construct the apertures around each of the images for measuring the\nmagnification ratios. The improved spatial resolution that would come with using a space-based\nobservations (or with adaptive optics-enhanced spectroscopy from the ground) would be of great\nbenefit in reducing this uncertainty.\nA.\n\nContribution of Wavelength Dependent Magnification\n\nIt is possible that the magnification of the BLR is not uniform as would probably be the\ncase if microlensing is important and the BLR size is of order the Einstein radius of the stars\nin the lens galaxy. This possibility can be tested if the BLR has a coherent large scale velocity\nstructure as in the case of a rotating disk or spherical infall. In this case a small scale variation in\nthe magnification would distort the the broad line in one or more of the images. This effect was\nproposed by Nemiroff (1988). The contribution of such a wavelength dependent magnification\nto the differential magnification ratio can be assessed by comparing the line profiles from the\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.-\n\nThe line profile distortion parameter, equation A1, between image A and the other images. The central peak is\n0.3 mag which indicates that the wavelength independent contribution to the NLR/BLR differential magnification ratio is at\nminimum 0.3 mag.\n\ntwo images.\nIf the wavelength of the ith pixel of a spectrum is \u03bbi then the flux in this pixel is\nF (\u03bbi ) = \u03bc(\u03bbi )f (\u03bbi ) where f (\u03bbi ) is the flux before magnification and \u03bc(\u03bbi ) is the magnification\nP\nat that wavelength. The total flux from the BLR is F = i F (\u03bbi ). We will assume that one of\nthe BLR images is uniformly magnified, i.e. the magnification is not a function of wavelength.\nTo be specific we will label this image B although it could be any image or an average of some\nof the images. For this image F B (\u03bbi )/F B (\u03bbo ) = f (\u03bbi )/f (\u03bbo ) where \u03bbo is a reference pixel that\ncan be varied. Because the pre-lensed line profile, f (\u03bbi ), is the same for all the images we can\ncalculate the change to the total flux in image A caused by a frequency dependent magnification:\nR(\u03bbo ) \u2261\n\nF A \u2212 FoA\nF B (\u03bbo )F A\n=\n\u22121\nFoA\nF A (\u03bbo )F B\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere FoA is what the total flux would be if the magnification were uniform and equal to\n\u03bcA (\u03bbo ). Another way to think of this quantity is to note that if you wanted to correct the\nobserved differential magnification ratio (with the sign convention used in this paper) to what it\nwould be if the BLR magnification ratio where uniformly \u03bcB /\u03bcA (\u03bbo ) then one would subtract\n2.5 log[R(\u03bbo ) + 1] magnitudes. After subtracting the continuum and masking any sky lines\nequation (A1) can be applied directly to the data to determine if a wavelength dependent\ncomponent of the magnification is causing a significant change in the line flux. Figure 16 shows\nthis for our data.\nMicrolensing is not the only thing that could affect the line profiles. Within the broad line\nthere is also a contribution from the NLR. This NLR contamination will reduce the magnitude\nof the differential magnification ratio, diluting any signal from substructure. It will also\nmake images with relatively bright BLRs have a wider line profiles as is observed in our data\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n(Figure 6). If we use a simple model where there is a distinct NLR and BLR in H\u03b2 (which is\nprobably not the case) and we denote their magnifications as \u03bcNL and \u03bcBL respectively then the\nexpected shape parameter will be\nR(\u03bbo ) =\n\n(\u03c9(\u03bbo ) \u2212 \u03c9)(rA \u2212 rB )\n(\u03c9(\u03bbo ) + rA )(\u03c9 + rB )\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = fNL /fBL and r = \u03bcBL /\u03bcNL . Note that if the NLR and BLR components of the line\nare both symmetric then this effect will not make the line asymmetric. More generally, since the\nNL is narrow by definition the line profile should only be modified in the central region.\nIt is also interesting to note that in the limit that \u03c9 \u2192 0 while the central wavelength is still\ndominated by the NL (\u03c9(\u03bbH\u03b2 ) \u2192 \u221e) R(\u03bbH\u03b2 ) = DMR \u2212 1. With our data this would give an\nestimate of DMR = 0.3 mag between A and B images - still well above the noise. This is a\nlower limit since as the dominance of the NL at the central wavelength, \u03c9(\u03bbH\u03b2 ), is reduced the\nimplied DMR becomes larger.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association\nof Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.
