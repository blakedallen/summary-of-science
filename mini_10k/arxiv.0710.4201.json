However, it was pointed\nout already long ago [2] that energy-momentum conservation\nE = Er + \u03c9, p = pr + k\n\n(2)\n\nasks for a somewhat modified relation between the cone angle \u03b8 and the\nrefractive index of a medium n. Here, E, p and Er , pr are energies and momenta of the primary and recoiled emitters (electrons) while \u03c9, k correspond\nto the emitted quantum (photon).\nSuch a relation was first derived in [2]. The only new element compared to\nusual energy-momentum conservation laws in vacuum is the relation between\n1\n\ne-mail: dremin@lpi.ru\n\n1\n\n\fthe momentum of the emitted quantum k and its energy \u03c9 in a medium with\nthe refractive index n:\nk = \u03c9n.\n(3)\nLet us stress here that this relation is a consequence of the collective response of the medium to the quanta passing through it. This is described\nmacroscopically by the refractive index n. Its quantitative microscopic interpretation is still missing. The whole process is considered in the rest system\nof the infinite medium.\nThe solution of energy-momentum conservation conditions for relativistic\n(\u03b2 \u2248 1) electrons with this requirement leads to the following formula [2]:\ncos \u03b8 =\n\n1\n\u03c9 2\n1+\n(n \u2212 1) .\nn\n2E\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(4)\n\nThe second term in the brackets is positive for n > 1 and diminishes the\ncone angle \u03b8. It is small for low energies of photons \u03c9 \u226a E and/or for\nthe refractive index n close to 1. It would become important for energetic\nphotons and large refractive indices.\nIn realistic situations with usual Cherenkov effect, the correction term\nappears to be inessential for photons because their energies are much less than\nthe energy of electrons-emitters and the refractive indices of most ordinary\nmedia are rather close to 1. Therefore Eq. (1) can be used for Cherenkov\nphotons with good accuracy. At the same time this correction happened to\nbe important when considering the anomalous Doppler effect [3].\n\n2\n\nCherenkov gluons.\n\nThe situation changes if one considers the emission of Cherenkov gluons\n(first proposed in [4, 5]) whose energies can be comparable by an order of\nmagnitude to the energy of a parton-emitter producing a jet. Moreover,\nthe partons-emitters are color charged and can be refracted in the nuclear\nmedium. We'll discuss this in Section 3, and first consider just the refraction\nof emitted gluons.\nIn contrast to Cherenkov photons propagating in ordinary media, the\nnuclear refractive index n is unknown for Cherenkov gluons. Theoretical attempts to estimate it are related either to its connection with the real parts\n2\n\n\fof hadronic forward scattering amplitudes using further assumption on applicability of their common features to gluons as well [4, 5] or to calculations\nof the polarization operator in simplified models [6] (more discussion can be\nfound in the review papers [7, 8]). They depend strongly on the unknown\ndensity of scattering centers in hadronic media. Therefore, it becomes the\nmain goal to find n by measuring the cone angle in high energy nucleusnucleus collisions. From Eq. (4) applied now to gluons the nuclear refractive\nindex n can be expressed as a function of the angle \u03b8:\nn=\n\n\u0011\nE\u0010\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 ((1 \u2212 \u03c9/E)2 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8)1/2 .\n\u03c9\n\n(5)\n\nConsidering real values of n one gets from (5) the upper limit on the allowed\nrange of gluon energies\n\u03c9 \u2264 E(1 \u2212 sin \u03b8).\n(6)\nThis region becomes narrower at large cone angles. For gluons with larger\nenergies \u03c9 the refractive index acquires the imaginary part. Therefore the\ndamping increases.\nThe relation (5) is very simple for rather soft gluons satisfying the condition \u03c9 \u226a 0.5E cos2 \u03b8:\nn\u2248\n\n1\n\u03c9\n1+\ntan2 \u03b8 .\ncos \u03b8\n2E\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\nOne concludes that the traditional estimates of n from the measured angle \u03b8\nusing only the first term of (7) are lower than its actual value. The second\nterm can be rather important at large cone angles \u03b8 even at small gluon\nenergies \u03c9 \u226a E.\nLet us relate these formulas to experimental findings. The cone structure\nof hadron emission around the away-side jets has been observed in several\nexperiments on nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nThe cone angle values are quite large so that the second term in Eq. (7) is\nimportant. They vary between 60o and 70o . This undefiniteness is related to\ndifferent methods of rings presentation and to their finite widths. Surely, this\nrange will become shorter with newly coming data. We present our estimates\nfor two values of cos \u03b8 equal to 0.5 (60o) and 0.342 (70o) to demonstrate how\nimportant are the corrections obtained above.\n\n3\n\n\fAt \u03b8 = 60o one gets \u03c9 < 0.134E, n = 2(1 + 1.5\u03c9/E) < 2.4. If the total\nenergy of the away-side jet is E = 5 GeV, it implies \u03c9 < 0.67 GeV, i.e. only\nstates in the low-mass wing of \u03c1-resonance can be created.\nAt \u03b8 = 70o one gets \u03c9 < 0.06E, n = 2.9(1 + 3.8\u03c9/E) < 3.6. For E = 5\nGeV we get \u03c9 < 0.3 GeV, i.e. in this case only very low energy tail of \u03c1resonance can play a role so that one would expect low intensity for such a\nprocess. The value n = 3 used in [7, 8] lies in between the above limits.\n\n3\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIn electrodynamics, the charged current (electrons) differs strongly from neutral emitted radiation (photons). Therefore, the medium impact on these\ncomponents in Cherenkov effect is different. The refractive index is introduced for photons while the electron motion is considered as almost undisturbed. It is supported by smallness of energy losses for Cherenkov radiation.\nThat is why the relation (3) was used for photons only. In general, the refractive index depends on energy but it is constant with high precision for\nvisible light.\nIn chromodynamics, the partons-emitters (quarks or gluons) are colored\nas well as the emitted gluons. They differ only by their energies. In principle,\nall three of them can be refracted by the nuclear medium. If there is no\ndispersion (energy dependence) of the nuclear refractive index, the nuclear\nCherenkov effect is impossible. In above treatment, it was implicitly assumed\nthat the nuclear refractive index is constant and exceeds 1 for comparatively\nsoft emitted gluons while for emitters with high energies it is inessential, i.e.\nclose to 1. Then Eq. (4) is valid. This assumption can be justified only\nrelying on possible analogy of partonic properties to hadronic reactions used\nearlier (see reviews in [7, 8]).\nIt is well known for all studied hadron collisions that the real part of\nthe forward scattering amplitude depends on energy. It is positive in the\nlow-mass wings of the Breit-Wigner resonance regions, then it is negative at\nhigher energies and becomes again positive at extremely high energies but\nthe latest region is not considered right now. Since excess of n over 1 is\nproporional to this real part, one can argue [7, 8] that Cherenkov gluons\ncan excite the collective modes of the nuclear medium within the resonance\nregion. Thus the energy behaviour of the nuclear refractive index n plays\n4\n\n\fan important role for such emission2 . Since energies of partons-emitters\nare higher than those of Cherenkov gluon, one can neglect their refraction\nbecause n is close to 1 (and below it) in this region above resonances. Then\nthe formula (4) is justified for Cherenkov gluons if applied to results of trigger\nexperiments at RHIC.\nWhat concerns the non-trigger experiments with extremely high energy\npartons at LHC (in the third region described above), the refractive indices\nof all three participants can be taken into account. It leads to the simple\ngeneralization of above formulas so that Eq. (5) is replaced by\n!\n\nE\nn2\nn = n0 cos \u03b8 \u2212 ( r2 (1 \u2212 \u03c9/E)2 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8)1/2 ,\n\u03c9\nn0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere n0 and nr are the refractive indices of the initial and recoiled partons,\ncorrespondingly.\nIn particular, if the energies of the initial and recoiled partons are approximately the same then their refractive indices are almost equal (n0 \u2248 nr ),\nand one should use Eq. (7) with n replaced by the ratio n/n0 . At high energies the refractive indices decrease with energy increasing (see [7, 8]). Thus\nn0 is much closer to 1 than the refractive index n of the gluon emitted with\nlower (but still very high) energy. The above formulas work quite well in this\nregion also.\nTo conclude, we have shown that energy-momentum conservation laws\nplay a crucial role in determining main characteristics of emission of Cherenkov\ngluons. They should be carefully taken into account in analysis and interpretation of experimental data about the ring-like structure recently observed\nin high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Such analysis must reveal the values of the nuclear refractive index and their energy dependence. Herefrom\none would conclude about the state of the matter formed in high energy\nnucleus-nucleus collisions.\nAcknowledgements.\nThis work is supported in part by the RFBR grants 06-02-17051-a, 0602-16864-a.\n2\nIts energy dependence can be easily taken into account as it was done, e.g., in [15] but\nabove we used constant n treating it as an effective average value in the resonance region.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] I.E.
