Convection - Turbulence - Stars: oscillations - Stars: interiors\n\n1. Introduction\nScaling relations between asteroseismic quantities and stellar\nparameters such as stellar mass, radius, effective temperature\nand luminosity have been observationally derived by several authors (e.g. Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995; Chaplin et al. 2008, 2009;\nStello et al. 2009a) using ground-based data. More recently, the\nspace-missions CoRoT and Kepler confirmed those results by\nproviding accurate and homogeneous measurements for a large\nsample of stars from red giants to main-sequence stars (e.g.,\nMosser et al. 2010). Scaling relations are essential to study a\nlarge set of stars (e.g., Kallinger et al. 2009; Stello et al. 2009b)\nfor which, in general, little is known, to provide a first order estimate for mass and radius (e.g., Basu et al. 2010; Mosser et al.\n2010), or to probe the populations of red giants (Miglio et al.\n2009).\nScaling laws can also lead to a better understanding of the\nunderlying physical mechanisms governing the energetical behaviour of modes. In particular, it has been conjectured by\nBrown et al. (1991) that the frequency of the maximum of the\npower spectrum (\u03bdmax ) scales as the cut-off frequency \u03bdc because\nthe latter corresponds to a typical time-scale of the atmosphere.\nThe continuous increase of detected stars with solar-like oscillations has then confirmed this relation (e.g., Bedding & Kjeldsen\n2003; Stello et al. 2009a). However, the underlying physical origin of this scaling relation is still poorly understood. Indeed, \u03bdmax\nis associated with the coupling between turbulent convection and\noscillations and results from a balance between the damping and\nthe driving of the modes. The cut-off frequency is associated\nwith the mean surface properties of the star and the sound speed,\nmaking the origin of the \u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdc relation very intriguing.\nSend offprint requests to: K. Belkacem\nCorrespondence to: Kevin.Belkacem@ulg.ac.be\n\nAs a first step toward an understanding, one has to determine which of the damping rate or the excitation rate is the main\nresponsible for the maximum of power in the observed spectra. Chaplin et al. (2008), using a theoretical approach, pointed\nout that in the solar case \u03bdmax coincides with the plateau of\nthe linewidth variation with frequency. We will confirm this result using observations from the GOLF instrument in the solar\ncase. However, several issues remain to be addressed: is \u03bdmax for\nany star directly related with the observed plateau in the modewidths variation with frequency? In case of a positive answer,\nwhat is the origin of this relation? The first issue is quite difficult to answer as it is expected to strongly depend on the model\nused for the description of the pulsation-convection interaction.\nNevertheless, CoRoT observations begin to answer this issue and\nseveral stars (HD49933, HD180420, HD49385, and HD52265)\nsuggest that \u03bdmax correponds to the plateau of the damping rates\n(see Benomar et al. 2009; Barban et al. 2009; Deheuvels et al.\n2010; Ballot et al. 2011, for details). The second step consists in\ndetermining the main physical causes responsible for the plateau\nof the damping rates and its mean frequency (\u03bd\u0393 ). Subsequently,\none has to determine a general scaling law that relates the frequency of the plateau of the damping rates to the stellar parameters. In this paper, we discuss the first issue then we focus on the\nsecond issue by deriving a theoretical relation between \u03bd\u0393 and\n\u03bdc . If one accepts the positive answer to the first issue, this also\nprovides the scaling relation between \u03bdmax and \u03bdc .\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we present\nthe observed scaling law obtained from a homogeneous set of\nCoRoT data and show that the maximum mode height in the solar power spectrum coincides with a marked minimum of the\nmode-width when corrected from mode inertia. We then point\nout, in Sect. 3, that such a minimum is the result of a destabilizing effect in the super-adiabatic region. The relation between \u03bd\u0393\n\n\fBelkacem et al.: The underlying physical meaning of the \u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdc relation\n\n2\n\nand \u03bdc is demonstrated in Sect. 4, and conclusions are provided\nin Sect. 5.\n\n2. The observed scaling law\nWe use the CoRoT seimological field data to ensure a homogeneous sample: HD49933 (Benomar et al. 2009), HD181420\n(Barban et al. 2009), HD49385 (Deheuvels et al. 2010). We\nalso use the results on HD50890 (Baudin et al. 2011) and on\nHD181907 (Carrier et al. 2010), a red giant, and the Sun. The\ncharacteristics of these stars are listed in Table 1, as well as the\nway their fundamental parameter is obtained.\nFor the Sun, due to the presence of pseudo-modes above the\ncut-off frequency (e.g. Garcia et al. 1998), observational determination of \u03bdc is not obvious. Nevertheless, one can infer\n\u221a a theoretical relation for this frequency \u03c9c = cs /2H\u03c1 \u221d g/ T eff \u221d\n\u22121/2\nM R\u22122 T eff\n(e.g., Balmforth & Gough 1990), where cs is the\nsound speed, H\u03c1 the density scale height, g the gravitational\nfield, M the mass, R the radius, and T eff the temperature at the\nphotosphere. When scaled to the solar case, this relations becomes\n!\n!\u22122\n!\u22121/2\nM\nR\nT eff\n\u03bdc = \u03bdc\u2299\n,\n(1)\nM\u2299 R\u2299\nT eff\u2299\nwith \u03bdc\u2299 = 5.3mHz, and M\u2299 , R\u2299 , T eff\u2299 the solar values of mass,\nradius, and effective temperature respectively. Note that we will\nassume H\u03c1 = Hp = P/\u03c1g with P, \u03c1 respectively denoting pressure, density. This is a commonly used approximation (e.g.,\nStello et al. 2009a) that presupposes an isothermal atmosphere,\nwhich is of sufficient accuracy for our purposes.\nUsing the stars listed in Table 1, and their measured \u03bdmax , the\nrelation between \u03bdmax and \u03bdc is displayed in Fig. 1. It relies on\ntwo kinds of results: direct observations of \u03bdmax in the spectrum\nof the star on one hand, and on estimates of the mass (M), radius (R) and effective temperature (T eff ) of the star on the other\nhand. The latter are derived from photometric or spectroscopic\nobservations but can be derived in some cases from stellar modelling. Here, M and R must be derived from stellar modelling\nand not from scaling laws as the aim of this work is to establish\nsuch a scaling law. The strict proportionality (the fitted slope is\n1.01 \u00b1 0.02) is clearly seen from this sample spanning from the\nSun to a luminous red giant (HD50890). This is in agreement\nwith the results obtained by several authors for main-sequence\nstars (e.g., Bedding & Kjeldsen 2003), as well as red giants (e.g.\nMosser et al. 2010). The issue is now to assess the physical background underlying this relation.\n\n3. Height maximum in the power spectrum\nIn this section, we confirm that the maximum of the power spectrum of solar-like oscillations is related to the plateau of the linewidth by using solar observations from the GOLF instrument\nand we then discuss the physical origin of the depression of the\ndamping rates (i.e. the plateau).\n\nStar name\nSun\nHD49933\nHD181420\nHD49385\nHD52265\nHD181907\nHD50890\n\nT e f f (K)\n5780\n6650\n6580\n6095\n6115\n4760\n4665\n\nWe consider the height H of a given mode in the power spectrum,\nwhich is a natural observable.

The normalized\nmode height (H) corresponds to the dashed line. All quantities\nare normalized to unity at the frequency of \u03bd = \u03bdmax . The associated mode masses are computed as described in Belkacem et al.\n(2006).\n\nHowever, it is useful to express H in a form that does not\nexplicitly depend on the mode mass (M). To this end, we note\nfrom Eqs. (2) and (4) that both the excitation P and the damping rate \u03b7 are inversely proportional to the mode mass. Hence,\nto disentangle the effect of the driving and damping from the effect of mode mass, we introduce the quantities \u03a0 = P M and\n\u0398 = \u03b7 M, independent of mode masses. Then, using Eq.

One can clearly distinguish a maximum for H near \u03bd \u2243 3.2 mHz that corresponds to\nthe \u03bdmax frequency. \u03a0 remains roughly constant (efficient driving regime) except at high frequency beyond \u03bdmax which corresponds to the inefficient driving regime (see Samadi & Goupil\n2001, for details). On the other hand 1/\u03982 shows a sharp maximum and its variation clearly dominates over that of \u03a0 and controls the variation of H and the apparition of its maximum. We\nconclude that the maximum of H is determined by the minimum\nof \u03982 and corresponds to the plateau of the line widths. In other\nwords, the depression (plateau) of the damping rates \u03b7 is responsible for the presence of a maximum in the power spectrum, in\nagreement with Chaplin et al. (2008).\n3.2. Origin of the depression of the damping rates\n\nBalmforth (1992) mentioned that the depression of the solar\ndamping rates originate from a destabilising effect in the superadiabatic layer. He also stressed that the plateau of the damping\nrates occurs when there is a resonance between the thermal time\nscale and the modal frequency.\nFollowing these ideas, we use the MAD non-adiabatic pulsation code (Dupret 2002) for computing the solar damping\nrates. This code includes a time-dependent convection treatment (Grigahc\u00e8ne et al. 2005) different from that by Balmforth\n(1992). Nevertheless, we reach the same conclusion (see\n\n3\n\nAppendix A for details): the responsible for the destabilizing effect is the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy (\u03b4S ) that exhibits\na rapid variation mainly in the super-adiabatic layer as well as in\nthe atmospheric layers (see Appendix A.2 and Fig. A.2).\nTo understand the origin of such an oscillation and illustrate\nthe occurrence of the resonance, we consider the super-adiabatic\nlayers and we examine the case of a highly non-adiabatic solution (see Pesnell 1984, for the case of a purely radiative envelope). We assume that Lagrangian perturbations of radiative\nand convective luminosities are dominated by perturbations of\nentropy (see Eq. (A.6) and Eq. (A.7)). This leads to a secondorder equation for the entropy perturbations \u03b4S (Eq. (A.16),\nsee Appendix. A.3 for the derivation). To obtain a more explicit\nsolution for \u03b4S , we further employ the dimensional approximation d\u03b4L/dr \u223d \u03b4L/H p , so that\n!\n!\nd\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S\n+\u03bb\n= 0 , with \u03bb = A \u2212 i B ,\n(7)\nd ln T cv\ncv\nwhere cv = (\u2202U/\u2202T )\u03c1 with U the internal energy, A and B are\ndefined by\n!\u0012\nLc \u0013\u22121\nLc d ln cv LR\nA=\n\u03c8\n+\n(4 \u2212 \u03baT ) 1 + (\u03c8 \u2212 1)\nL d ln T\nL\nL\n\u0014\nLc \u0015\u22121\n,\n(8)\nB = Q 1 + (\u03c8 \u2212 1)\nL\nwhere \u03baT = (\u2202 ln \u03ba/\u2202 ln T )\u03c1 , Lc , and LR are the convective and\nradiative luminosity respectively, T the temperature, \u03c8 is defined\nby Eq. (A.8), and we have defined the ratio Q such as\nQ = \u03c9\u03c4 ,\n\nwith\n\n\u03c4\u22121 =\n\nL\n\u22121\n= \u03c4\u22121\nconv + \u03c4rad\n4\u03c0r2 \u03c1cv T H p\n\n(9)\n\nwith \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 \u03bd, \u03bd the modal frequency, \u03c4 a local thermal timescale, \u03c4rad and \u03c4conv the radiative and convective thermal timescales, respectively. From Eq. (A.12),\npart of the\nh R the oscillatory\ni\nfinal solution is (\u03b4S /cv ) \u221d exp \u2212i B d ln T , which describes\nthe oscillatory behaviour of entropy perturbations in the superadiabatic layers.\nAs discussed in Appendix B3 (Fig B2 top), all modes in the\nrange of interest have a similar negative integrated work, W, at\nthe bottom of the superadiabatic layer. This corresponds to a\nlarge damping at this level in the star. In the superadiabatic layers, the entropy's oscillatory behaviour controls the oscillating\nbehavior of W. When the pulsation period and thus the wavelength of the entropy perturbations are too large (Q \u226a 1), the\ndestabilizing contribution has not grown enough; the cumulated\nwork W increases too slowly. The net result at the surface is a\nlarge damping. When the period is too small (Q \u226b 1), the rapid\noscillation of the entropy perturbation causes a rapid oscillation\nof W which increases and again decreases before reaching the\nsurface and the net result at the surface is again a large damping. Those two limits correspond to low and high frequencies,\ni.e. to the two branches of 1/\u03982 displayed in Fig. 2. A minimum\ndamping is then obtained for a period neither too small nor too\nlarge i.e. Q \u2243 1 where the destabilizing contribution nearly but\nnot quite compensates the strong damping of the layers below\nthe super adiabatic layers.\nThe value of Q is illustrated in Fig. 3 for three modes. It\nconfirms that the resonance Q \u2243 1 occurs in the super-adiabatic\nregion for the mode with frequency \u03bd \u2243 \u03bdmax . Hence from the Q\ndefinition Eq. (9), one derives the resonance condition\n\u03bdmax \u2243\n\n1\n.\n2\u03c0 \u03c4\n\n(10)\n\n\fBelkacem et al.: The underlying physical meaning of the \u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdc relation\n\n4\n\nFig. 3.

Derivation of the scaling law\nWe now turn to the relation between the thermal time-scale (\u03c4)\nand the cut-off frequency. To this end, we use a grid of stellar models for masses between M = 1 M\u2299 and M = 1.4 M\u2299\nfrom the ZAMS to the ascending vertical branch, typical of observed solar-like pulsators. The grid is obtained by using the stellar evolution code CESAM2k (Morel 1997; Morel & Lebreton\n2008). The atmosphere is computed assuming a grey Eddington\natmosphere. Convection is included according to B\u00f6hm-Vitense\nmixing-length (MLT) formalism. The mixing-length parameter\nis \u03b1 = 1.6. The chemical composition follows Asplund et al.\n(2005), with an helium mass fraction of 0.2485. All quantities\nare evaluated at the maximum of the super-adibatic gradient,\nwhich corresponds to the maximum of \u03b4S (see Sect. 3.2) and\nthe location of the resonance (see Eq. (10)).\nFrom Fig. 4 (top), the relation between the thermal frequency\n(1/\u03c4) and the cut-off frequency (\u03bdc ) is close to linear but still\nshows a significant dispersion. More precisely, the relation between those two frequencies is approximatively linear and the\ndispersion is related to the dispersion in mass, in agreement with\nobservations (e.g. Mosser et al. 2010). We then conclude that\nthe observed relation between \u03bdmax and \u03bdc is in fact the result\nof the resonance between \u03bdmax and 1/\u03c4, as well as the relation\nbetween 1/\u03c4 and \u03bdc .\nTo go further, let us investigate the relation between 1/\u03c4 and\n\u03bdc . First, Eq. (9) can be recast as\n\"\n#\n1\nFrad\nFconv\n1+\n,\n(11)\n=\n\u03c4 \u03c1cv T H p\nFconv\nwhere Fconv and Frad are the convective and radiative fluxes, respectively. The MLT solution for the convective flux and the convective rms velocity can be written (see Cox & Giuli 1968, for\ndetails)\nFconv =\nvconv =\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u039b\n\u03c1c p vconv T\n\u2207 \u2212 \u2207\u2032\n2\nHp\n\u00011/2\n\u03b1cs \u03a31/2\n\u221a 1/2 \u2207 \u2212 \u2207\u2032\n2 2\u03931\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nFig. 4. Top: Thermal frequency (1/\u03c4) computed from Eq. (9)\nversus the cut-off frequency computed following Eq. (1), normalized to the solar values, for models with masses ranging from\nM = 1M\u2299 to M = 1.4M\u2299 (with an increment of 0.05M\u2299) and\nfrom the ZAMS to the ascending vertical branch. Bottom: The\nsame as for the top panel, except the thermal frequency is divided by the Mach number to the third versus the normalized\ncut-off frequency.\n\nwhere \u039b = \u03b1H p is the mixing length, \u03b1 the mixing-length parameter, \u2207 = (d ln T/d ln P), \u2207\u2032 = (d ln T \u2032 /d ln P) the gradient\nof rising convective element, \u03a3 = (\u2202 ln \u03c1/\u2202 ln T )\u03bc,P , with \u03bc the\nmean molecular weight, and \u03931 = (\u2202 ln P/\u2202 ln \u03c1)ad . Now, by inserting Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) into Eq. (11), one obtains\n\uf8eb 2 \uf8f6\n!\n!\"\n#\n\uf8ec\uf8ec \u0393 \uf8f7\uf8f7 M3a\n1\ncs\nFrad\n1+\n(14)\n= 8 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed 1 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u03c4\n\u03c7\u03c1 \u03a3\n\u03b1\n2H p\nFconv\nwhere Ma = vconv /cs the Mach number, and \u03c7\u03c1 =\n(\u2202 ln P/\u2202 ln \u03c1)T .\nWe verified that for a given physic, the ratio Frad /Fconv is approximately the same for all the models considered in the superadiabatic layer. Hence, by use of Eq. (14) as well as the resonance condition (Eq. (10)), we conclude that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n!\n1 \uf8ec\uf8ec \u03932 \uf8f7\uf8f7 M3a\n\u03bdc ,\n(15)\n\u03bdmax \u221d \u221d \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed 1 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u03c4\n\u03c7\u03c1 \u03a3\n\u03b1\n\nwhich is the observed scaling between \u03bdmax and \u03bdc (see Fig. 1),\nsince the thermodynamic quantities hardly vary.\n\n\fBelkacem et al.: The underlying physical meaning of the \u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdc relation\n\nEquation (15) describes the observed scaling between \u03bdmax\nand \u03bdc (see Fig. 1) but also shows that most of the departure from\nthe linear relationship between 1/\u03c4 and \u03bdc comes from the Mach\nnumber, as confirmed by Fig. 4 (bottom panel). We also point\nout that as shown by Fig. 4 and Fig. 1 for the main-sequence\nstars, the departure from the linear relationship is of the same\norder of magnitude as the uncertainties on the cut-off frequency.\nHowever, our grid of models is not suited for a proper comparison between the observations and the theoretical relation. This\nwork is definitely desirable in the future.\n\n5. Conclusion\nWe have addressed the issue of the physical reason for the existence of a scaling relation between \u03bdmax and \u03bdc . We have found\nthat the depression of the damping rates determines \u03bdmax because\nthere is a resonance between the local thermal time-scale in the\nsuper-adiabatic region and the modal period. This implies that\n\u03bdmax does not scale only with \u03bdc but also with the ratio M3a /\u03b1.\nAs pointed out in Sect. 1, the observed scaling between \u03bdmax and\n\u03bdc is not obvious at first glance since the first frequency depends\non the dynamical properties of the convective region while the\nsecond is a static property of the surface layers. The additional\ndependence the Mach number resolves this paradox.\nThis scaling relation is potentially a powerful probe to constraint the dynamical properties of the upper-most layers of\nsolar-like pulsators through the ratio M3a /\u03b1. Indeed, as shown in\nthis paper, most of the dispersion in the \u03bdmax \u2212\u03bdc scaling is related\nto the Mach number. The investigation of the ratio between \u03bdmax\nand \u03bdc in main-sequence stars, subgiants, and red giants may give\nus statistical information on the evolution of the properties of turbulent convection from main-sequence to red giant stars, through\nfor instance the mixing-length parameter. Indeed, a future work\nwill consist in computing models, that correspond to the observations, and to make a comparison between the observed and\ntheoretical dispersion from the linear relation between \u03bdmax and\n\u03bdc .\nIn other specific cases, for which stellar parameters are well\nknown (e.g., in pulsating binaries) the relation between \u03bdmax and\n\u03bdc could gives us directly the value of the Mach number in the\nupper-most convective layers.\nAcknowledgements.

Computation of the damping rates\n\nDamping rates have been computed with the non-adiabatic\npulsation code MAD (Dupret 2002). This code includes\na time-dependent convection (TDC) treatment described in\nGrigahc\u00e8ne et al. (2005). This formulation involves a free parameter \u03b2 which takes complex values and enters the perturbed\nenergy equation. This parameter was introduced to prevent the\noccurence of non-physical spatial oscillations in the eigenfunctions. We use here the value \u03b2 = \u22120.55 \u2212 1.7i which is calibrated so that resulting damping rates reproduce the variation\nof the solar damping rates \u03b7 with frequency and more precisely\nthe depression of the \u03b7 profile (see Fig. A.1). Note that TDC is\na local formulation of convection. This simplifies the theoretical description and is sufficient here as we seek for a qualitative\nunderstanding of the relation between the frequency location of\nthe damping rate depression and the cut-off frequency. We stress\nthat the above approximations do not influence qualitatively the\nconclusions.\nThis approach takes into account the role played by the variations of the convective flux, the turbulent pressure, and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy. Hence, the integral expression of the damping can be written as follows\n!#\n\" \u2217\nZ M\n1\n\u03b4\u03c1 \u03b4Pturb\n\u03b7=\n+ (\u03933 \u2212 1) T \u03b4S dm\nIm\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n2 \u03c9M |\u03ber (R)|2 0\n(A.1)\nwhere \u03ber (R) is the radial mode displacement at the photosphere, \u03c9 the mode frequency, \u03c1 the mean density, \u03933 \u2212 1 =\n(\u2202 ln T/\u2202 ln \u03c1)S , T the unperturbed temperature and the star\ndenotes the complex conjugate. The symbol \u03b4 represents a\nLagrangean perturbation: \u03b4S is the perturbation of specific entropy, \u03b4\u03c1 the density perturbation, \u03b4Pturb the perturbation of turbulent pressure. The quantity \u03b4Pturb /\u03c1 represents the contribution of turbulent pressure while the second term (\u03933 \u2212 1) T \u03b4S\nincludes the variations of radiative and convective fluxes as well\nas the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, as given by the\nenergy conservation equation\ni\u03c3T \u03b4S = \u2212\n\nd\u03b4Lr d\u03b4Lc\n\u2212\n+ \u03b4\u01ebt\ndm\ndm\n\n(A.2)\n\nwith \u03b4Lr , \u03b4Lc being the perturbations of the radiative and convective fluxes respectively, \u03b4\u01ebt the perturbation of the dissipation\nrate of turbulent kinetic energy into heat, and \u03c3 = \u03c9 + i\u03b7. Note\nthat Eq. (A.2) is only valid for radial modes we are interested in.\nA.2. Origin of the depression of the damping rates\n\nThe depression of the damping rates, located around \u03bd \u223c 3.5\nmHz (Fig.A.1), results from a subtle balance between the above\ncontributions to the work integral. The cumulated work integral\n(regions where it increases outwards drive the oscillation and regions where it decreases outwards damp the oscillation) allows\nus to identify the processes that create this depression. Fig. A.2\n(top) shows that mode damping results from stabilizing effects\nfrom inner layers at temperature greater than log T \u223d 4 destabilizing effects in the upper layers located in the super-adiabatic\nlayers (i.e. between log T \u223d 3.95 and log T \u223d 3.8) and for high\nradial order modes again stabilizing effects from the very outer\nlayers. Hence, the behavior of the product \u0398 of the damping rates to the mode mass, which is the integral appearing\nin Eq. (A.1), can then be described as follows: for modes with\n\nFig. A.1. Product of the damping rates (\u03b7) times the mode mass\n(M) versus mode frequency. The vertical dotted lines identify\nradial mode orders.\n\nfrequencies \u03bd \u2264 \u03bdmax the higher the mode frequency the larger\nthe contribution of the destabilizing region and \u0398 keeps on decreasing. For \u03bd > \u03bdmax , despite an increasing contribution of the\nsuperadiabatic boundary layers, atmospheric layers stabilize the\nmodes resulting in an increase of \u0398. At \u03bd = \u03bdmax , compensation\nis maximal giving rise to the minimum of \u0398.\nThe physical cause of the destabilizing effects in the superadiabatic regions is revealed by Fig. A.2 (middle). The\nLagrangian perturbation of entropy exhibits a rapid variation that\noccurs mainly in the super-adiabatic layer and in the atmospheric\nlayers. As the frequency of the mode increases, the amplitude of\nthis variation (which is a spatial oscillation as seen in the next\nsection) also increases. The wavelenth of this spatial oscillation\ndecreases with increasing frequency. This causes a similar behavior of the cumulated work.\nA.3. Oscillation of entropy fluctuations\n\nTo understand the behaviour of \u03b4S in this region, let us first examine the fluctuations of radiative and convective luminosity appearing in the energy equation (Eq. (A.2)).\nIn the diffusion approximation, the fluctuations of radiative\nluminosity reads\n\u03b4LR\n\u03ber\n\u03b4T \u03b4\u03ba \u03b4\u03c1 d\u03b4T/dr d\u03ber\n=2 +3\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nLR\nr\nT\n\u03ba\n\u03c1\ndT/dr\ndr\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere \u03ber is the mode's radial displacement, \u03b4T the Lagrangian\nperturbation of temperature, \u03b4\u03ba the perturbation of opacity,\nand \u03ba the opacity. By using the perturbed continuity equation\nEq. (A.3), becomes, for radial modes,\n\u03b4LR\n\u03b4T \u03b4\u03ba\nd \u0012 \u03b4T \u0013\nT\n+4\n=\n\u2212\n(A.4)\nLR\ndT/dr dr T\nT\n\u03ba\nwhere we have neglected \u03ber /r compared to \u2202\u03ber /\u2202r. This assumption is valid for radial p modes (see Belkacem et al. 2008, for\ndetails). We further assume that, in the super-adiabatic region,\nperturbation of temperature fluctuations and opacity are dominated by entropy fluctuations, so that\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4T\n\u223d\nT\ncv\n\nand\n\n\u03b4\u03ba\n\u03b4S\n\u223d \u03baT\n\u03ba\ncv\n\n(A.5)\n\n\fBelkacem et al.: The underlying physical meaning of the \u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdc relation\n\n7\n\nFig. A.3.

Hence, inserting Eqs. (A.5) in\nEq. (A.3) we obtain\n!\n\u03b4LR\nd \u03b4S\n\u03b4S\nT\n+ (4 \u2212 \u03baT )\n\u223d\n(A.6)\nLR\ndT/dr dr cv\ncv\n\nThe approximate expression Eq. (A.6), even if imperfect, captures the main behaviour of \u03b4LR /LR in the superadiabatic boundary region, as shown by Fig. A.3 (top). Note that the disagreement observed in the inner layers in Fig. A.3 (top panel) is due\nto the approximation Eq. (A.5) since for those layers the density\nfluctuations are dominant. However, we are mainly interested in\nthe super-adiabatic region (log T < 3.9) where Eq. (A.6) is sufficiently valid for our purpose.\nWe now turn to the Lagrangian perturbation of convective\nluminosity. It is dependent on the adopted time-dependent treatment of convection. Consistent with Sect. A.1, we use the formalism developed by Grigahc\u00e8ne et al. (2005). A good approximation of their Eq. (18) in the super-adiabatic layer, as shown\nby Fig. A.3 (bottom), is\n!\n!#\n\"\n\u03b4Lc\nd ln cv \u03b4S\nd\u03b4S\nT\nd \u03b4S\n+\n\u223d\u03c8\n=\u03c8\n,\nLc\ndS\ndr cv\ndr\ncv dT/dr\n\n(A.7)\n\n\fBelkacem et al.: The underlying physical meaning of the \u03bdmax \u2212 \u03bdc relation\n\n8\n\nwith\n\nwhere\n\u03c8 \u223dC 1+\n\n!\n\n((i + \u03b2)\u03c3\u03c4c + 2\u03c9R \u03c4c + 1) D\n.\nB + ((i + \u03b2)\u03c3\u03c4c + 1) D\n\n(A.8)\n\nwhere \u03c4c is the life-time of convective elements, \u03c9R is the characteristic cooling frequency of the turbulent eddies, and\ni\u03c3\u03c4c + \u039b\n,\n\u039b\n\u03c9R \u03c4c + 1\nC=\n,\n(i + \u03b2)\u03c3\u03c4c + \u03c9R \u03c4c + 1\nC\n.\nD=\n(\u03c9R \u03c4c + 1)\nB=\n\n(A.9)\n(A.10)\n(A.11)\n\nwhere \u039b = 8/3 is a constant introduced by Unno (1967) to close\nthe equation of motion describing convection, and \u03c9R is the characteristic cooling frequency of turbulent eddies due to radiative\nlosses (see Eq. (C12) of Grigahc\u00e8ne et al. 2005).\nWe are now interested in obtaining the equation that qualitatively explains the oscillation observed in Fig. A.2 (middle\npanel). Hence, one has to exhibit in an analytical way the frequency dependence of the entropy fluctuations (\u03b4S ). To this end,\nwe will use two different assumptions. The first, and most immediate way is to assume that in the energy equation (Eq. (A.2))\nd\u03b4L/dr \u223d \u03b4L/H p . This is a crude approximation, but which permits to immediately exhibit the role of the Q factor. Then using\nEq. (A.6) and Eq. (A.7), one obtains\n!\n\n!\n\nd\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S\n+\u03bb\n= 0,\nd ln T cv\ncv\n\n\u03bb = A \u2212 iB,\n\nwith\n\n(A.12)\n\nwhere A and B are defined by\n!\u0012\nLc \u0013\u22121\nLc d ln cv LR\n\u03c8\n+\n(4 \u2212 \u03baT ) 1 + (\u03c8 \u2212 1)\nL d ln T\nL\nL\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121\nLc\nB = Q 1 + (\u03c8 \u2212 1)\n,\n(A.13)\nL\n\nA=\n\nwhere we have defined the ratio Q as\nQ = \u03c9\u03c4 ,\n\nwith\n\n\u03c4\u22121 =\n\nL\n4\u03c0r2 \u03c1c\n\nvT Hp\n\n(A.14)\n\nwith \u03c4 is a local thermal time-scale. Note that we have neglected\nthe imaginary part of \u03c3 in Eq. (A.14). We stress that this thermal\ntime-scale can be recast into\n\u22121\n\u03c4\u22121 = \u03c4\u22121\nconv + \u03c4rad\n\n(A.15)\n\nwhere \u03c4conv and \u03c4rad are associated with the convective and radiative luminosities, respectively. From Eq. (A.12),\nh R the oscillatory\ni\npart of the final solution is (\u03b4S /cv ) \u221d exp \u2212i B d ln T , which\nexplains the oscillatory behaviour of entropy perturbations in the\nsuper-adiabatic layers and its frequency dependence.\nAn alternative way to proceed is to use the energy equation\n(Eq. (A.2)) together with Eq. (A.6) and Eq. (A.7), one obtains the\nsecond order differential equation\n!\n!\n!\nd\nd2\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S\n\u03b4S\n+G\n+H\n=0\nF\nd ln T cv\ncv\nd ln T 2 cv\n\n(A.16)\n\nF = 1 + (\u03c8 \u2212 1)\n\nLc\nL\n\nLR\nLc d ln cv\n(4 \u2212 \u03baT ) + \u03c8\nL\nL d ln T\ndF\nG=\n+K\nd ln T\n!\nHp\ndK\n\u2212 iQ\nH=\nd ln T\nHT\nK=\n\n(A.17)\n\nwhere HT is the temperature scale-height.\nTo derive an analytical solution of Eq. (A.16) is not trivial. Hence, further simplifications are needed. We then assume\nthe coefficients F , G, H are constant. Assuming solutions of the\nform (\u03b4S /cv ) \u221d ek ln T , one has the solutions for k\nh\ni1/2\n\u2212G \u00b1 G2 \u2212 4HF\nk1,2 =\n(A.18)\n2F\nAt the maximum of the super-adiabatic gradient, the radiative\nluminosity dominates over the convective ones. Hence, we further neglect the ratio Lc /L compared with LR /L. Eq. (A.18) then\nsimplifies to\n\uf8ee\n!! \uf8f9\nH p 1/2 \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n1 \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\ndG\n2\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\nk1,2 = \u2212 \uf8ef\uf8f0G \u00b1 G \u2212 4\n+ 4iQ\n(A.19)\n2\nd ln T\nHT\n\nFrom Eq. (A.19), one concludes that for Q \u226a 1, k is real and \u03b4S\ndoes not oscillate. This corresponds to the limit of low-frequency\nmodes for which both k and the imaginary part of \u03b4S are small,\nas confirmed by the full numerical computation presented in\nFig. A.2 (middle panel). In contrast, for Q \u226b 1 (i.e., for large\nfrequencies) the imaginary part of the wavenumber increases as\ndepicted by Fig. A.2 (middle panel).\nEventually, both methods to derive the frequency behaviour\nof \u03b4S converge toward the same conclusion, i.e. that the factor Q\nexplains the oscillation of entropy fluctuations and its frequency\ndependence.\n\n\f"}
