In a series of papers we have taken advantage of these mathematical techniques to study the known\nvariable stars and to search for new ones in several globular clusters of assorted metallicities (Arellano Ferro et al.\n2008a; 2008b; 2004, L\u00e1zaro et al. 2006). In particular we\nused the Fourier decomposition technique to estimate fundamental physical parameters of the RR Lyrae stars and\n\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations collected at the Indian Astrophysical\nObservatory, Hanle, India.\n\nwe searched for eclipsing binaries and variability among the\nblue stragglers. The calculation of the iron content [Fe/H]\nand absolute magnitude MV lead to a linear MV -[Fe/H] relationship (Arellano Ferro et al. 2008b) that is in agreement\nwith independent estimations from different empirical techniques (e.g. Cacciari & Clementini 2003; Chaboyer 1999).\nThe globular cluster NGC 5053 (R.A.(J2000)=\n13h 16m 27s .3, DEC(J2000)= +17\u25e6 41\u2032 52\u2032\u2032 , l = 335.7, b =\n+78.9) is located in the intermediate Galactic halo (Z =\n16.1 kpc, RG =16.9 kpc) and it is one of the most metal deficient clusters; [Fe/H] = \u22122.1 (Rutledge et al. 1997). It is a\nrather disperse and well resolved system which allows high\nquality photometry even in the central regions. Such characteristics place this stellar system close to the grey region\nbetween globular clusters and open clusters. Nevertheless it\nwas classified as a globular cluster mainly due to its high\ngalactic latitude and the presence of faint stars and some\n\n\f2\n\nA. Arellano Ferro et al.\n\nvariables (Cuffey 1943, Baade 1928). The cluster has been\nthe subject of detailed photometric studies and the most recent ones, already in the CCD era, conducted detailed studies of known RR Lyrae stars (Nemec, Mateo & Schombert\n1995) and the identification of 28 blue stragglers (Nemec &\nCohen 1989; Sarajedini & Milone 1995) among which 5 are\nknown to be SX Phe variables (Nemec et al. 1995).\nIn the present paper we perform standard V , I and\ninstrumental r CCD photometry for nearly 6500 stars in\nthe field of NGC 5053 and perform the Fourier light curve\ndecomposition of the known RR Lyrae stars. We also search\nfor variability among Blue Straggler (BS) stars and revisit\nthe known SX Phe stars previously studied by Nemec et al.\n(1995), in an attempt to refine their periodicities in order to\ndiscuss their period changes and to use them as independent\nindicators of the distance to the cluster. Finally we report\nfive new SX Phe stars, three new BS stars, and one new red\ngiant variable (RGV).\nThe paper is organised as follows: in \u00a7 2 we describe\nthe observations, data reductions and transformations to the\nstandard photometric system. In \u00a7 3 a period analysis of the\nRR Lyrae stars is performed. In \u00a7 4 the V light curves of the\nRR Lyrae stars are Fourier decomposed and their physical\nparameters are estimated. In \u00a7 5 the periods and secular\nperiod changes of the SX Phe stars are discussed as well\nas the BS nature of previously reported BS stars. In \u00a7 6 a\nsearch for new variables is carried out and the new variables\nare described. In \u00a7 7 the distance and age of NGC 5053 are\ndiscussed and in \u00a7 8 we summarise our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTIONS\n\nThe observations employed in the present work were performed using the Johnson V , R and I filters and obtained\nwith the 2.0m telescope of the Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO), Hanle, India, located at 4500m above sea level,\nduring several runs between April 2006 and January 2009.\nThe cluster was observed during a total of 10 nights and 151\nimages were gathered in the Johnson V , 139 in R and 13 in\nI. The average seeing was \u223c1 arcsec. The detector was a\nThompson CCD of 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels with a pixel scale of\n0.17 arcsec/pix and a field of view of approximately 11.\u00d711.\narcmin.\nDifference image analysis (DIA) is a powerful technique\nallowing accurate PSF photometry of CCD images, even\nin very crowded fields (Alard & Lupton 1998; Alard 2000;\nBramich et al. 2005). In the present study, we used a prerelease version of the DANDIA1 software for the DIA (Bramich\net al., in preparation), which employs a new algorithm for\ndetermining the convolution kernel matching a pair of images of the same field (Bramich 2008). This algorithm was\napplied to a set of V , R and I images of NGC 5053 in order\nto obtain accurate time-series photometry and to search for\nnew variable stars down to V \u223c 19.5 mag.\nFor a brief description of the DIA procedure the reader\nis referred to \u00a7 2 of the paper by Arellano Ferro et al. (2008b)\nThe instrumental v and i magnitudes were converted to the Johnson V and I standard system\n1\n\nDANDIA is built from the DanIDL library of IDL routines available at http://www.danidl.co.uk\n\nFigure 1.

Our light curves were originally phased with the\nephemerides of Nemec (2004). However, except for V5 and\nV10, we noticed that this produced poor quality folded light\ncurves. To calculate the periods at the epoch of our observations we applied the phase dispersion minimisation technique (PDM) (Burke et al. 1970; Dworetsky 1983). The periods that we found are listed in column 2 of Table 1. In most\ncases the new periods differ substantially from thoes from\nNemec (2004) (e.g. V3, V7 and V8) while for V5 and V10\nthe periods coincide within 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 days; in these cases\nthe periods from Mannino (1963) and Nemec (2004) were\nadopted respectively. We have also estimated a number of\nepochs of maximum V light and these are listed in column\n3 of Table 1.\n\nIn Fig. 2 the light curves in standard V I and instrumental r magnitudes are displayed. The vertical scale is the\nsame for all stars and filters so that amplitude and brightness differences can be seen at a glance.\nAll our V , r and I photometry for the RR Lyrae stars\nis available in Table 2.

Since only a few years have elapsed between\nthe most recent data of Nemec in 2002 and the earliest data\nfrom this paper in 2006, there is very little that we could add\nto Nemec's O-C diagrams and/or the derived period change\nrates. We adopted his period change rates (column 11 of his\nTable 7) in order to predict the period at the average epoch\n\n\f4\n\nA. Arellano Ferro et al.\n\nof our data. The predicted periods are listed in column 4\nof Table 1. These predicted periods do not phase our light\ncurves correctly in all cases, and in some cases there are\nsubstantial differences with the best periods found in this\nwork (column 2), which were used to phase the light curves\nshown in Fig. 2. Therefore, it seems likely that the secular\nperiod changes quoted by Nemec (2004) are overwhelmed\nby observational inaccuracies.\n\n4\n\nFOURIER DECOMPOSITION APPROACH\nTO THE PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF RR\nLYRAE STARS\n\nThe red continuous curve in each of the V light curve panels\nof Fig. 2 is the Fourier fit to the data and it is mathematically represented by an equation of the form:\nm(t) = Ao +\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\nAk cos (\n\n2\u03c0\nk (t \u2212 E) + \u03c6k ),\nP\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m(t) are magnitudes at time t, P the period and E the\nepoch. A linear minimisation routine is used to fit the data\nwith the Fourier series model, deriving the best fit values of\nthe amplitudes Ak and phases \u03c6k of the sinusoidal harmonics. From the amplitudes and phases of the harmonics in eq.\n1, the Fourier parameters are defined as: \u03c6ij = j\u03c6i \u2212 i\u03c6j ,\nand Rij = Ai /Aj . The number of harmonics required for the\nproper fit of a given light curve depends on the quality of the\ndata; basically on the scatter and the coverage of the light\ncurve. We have fitted as many harmonics as possible as long\nas their amplitudes are significant. The magnitude-weighted\nmean magnitudes A0 (or (V )), the amplitudes and phases\nof the first four harmonics, which are relevant to the physical parameter calibrations described below, and the total\nnumber of harmonics employed (NH) are listed in Table 3.\nIn order to estimate the magnitude-weighted mean (I),\nthe I-curves were also analysed using the Fourier decomposition by eq. 1 despite possessing a sparse phase coverage.\nThe order of harmonics in this case was kept as low as possible until a smooth curve of similar appearance to the V\nlight curve was obtained.\nThe Fourier fit parameters in V have been used to derive physical parameters of the RR Lyrae stars. To calculate [Fe/H], and MV for each individual star we followed\nthe procedure described in the paper by Arellano Ferro et\nal. (2008b) where a detailed discussion on the Fourier approach, its limitations and advantages is given. We do not\nrepeat that discussion here and instead the interested reader\nis referred to that paper. In the following subsections we\nbriefly describe the transformations employed to calculate\nthe iron content and the luminosity for both RRc and RRab\nstars. Fourier based calculations of the effective temperatures, radii and masses are also addressed.\n4.1\n\nThe iron abundance [Fe/H]\n\nNGC 5053 has often been considered as the most metal deficient globular cluster in the Galactic Halo. Zinn (1985) lists\nthe cluster with [Fe/H] = \u22122.58 \u00b1 0.27 which corresponds\nto the value \u22122.4 \u00b1 0.3 in the Cohen scale determined by\nBell & Gustafsson (1983) via the comparison of synthetic\n\nspectra with the observed spectra of stars in the cluster.\nDespite the large uncertainty, this value for [Fe/H] is commonly found in the literature for NGC 5053. Considerable\neffort has been invested in the calculation of the metallicity\nof the cluster after those first estimates, and numerous values\nare found in the literature: Suntzeff, Kraft & Kinman (1988),\nfrom spectral analysis of the Ca H&K found \u22122.18 \u00b1 0.06\nand from the Mg 5130-5200\u00c5 band: \u22122.44 \u00b1 0.21; Armandroff et al. (1992), from the analysis of the Ca II triplet\nin the 8500-8660\u00c5 region found \u22122.41 \u00b1 0.12. A detailed\ndiscussion on the iron abundance of NGC 5053 has been\ngiven by Geisler et al. (1995) from which it can be highlighted that the more recent determinations find considerably higher values of [Fe/H]. Geisler et al. (1995), from an\nanalysis of medium resolution spectra of the Ca II triplet,\nfound [Fe/H]= \u22122.10\u00b10.06, and by reconsidering BV I data\nfrom Sarajedini & Milone (1995) and the Ca II triplet equivalent widths of Armandroff et al. (1992), find the values of\n\u22122.21 and \u22122.22 respectively. Finally, Geisler et al. conclude\nthat a likely value of [Fe/H] in NGC 5053 is \u22122.15. Geisler\net al. (1995) also argue that the lower metallicity limit for\nglobular clusters in the Galaxy is \u22122.25 \u00b1 0.10. A more recent analysis of the Ca II triplet by Rutledge et al. (1997)\nderives a value of \u223c \u22122.10 \u00b1 0.07 for the iron content of this\ncluster.\nFor the RRab stars, the calibration of Jurcsik & Kov\u00e1cs\n(1996) was employed:\n(s)\n\n[Fe/H]J = \u22125.038 \u2212 5.394 P + 1.345 \u03c631 ,\n(s)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c631 is the phase in a sine series. The phase in a sine\n(s)\n(c)\nseries \u03c631 is related to the phase in a cosine series \u03c631 via:\n(s)\n(c)\n\u03c6jk = \u03c6jk \u2212 (j \u2212 k) \u03c02 . The standard deviation of this calibration is 0.14 dex (Jurcsik 1998).\nThe metallicity scale of the above equation was transformed into the ZW scale using the relation [Fe/H]J =\n1.431[Fe/H]ZW + 0.88 (Jurcsik 1995).\nEq. 2 is applicable to RRab stars with a deviation parameter Dm , defined by Jurcsik & Kov\u00e1cs (1996) and Kov\u00e1cs\n& Kanbur (1998), not exceeding a proper limit. These authors suggest Dm 6 3.0. Dm values for individual RRab\nstars are given in column 2 of Table 4. All stars fulfill the\ncondition except V10 which is not included in the [Fe/H]\naverage. The iron abundances [Fe/H]ZW for the RRab stars\nare reported in Table 4\nMean values [Fe/H]ZW = \u22121.97 \u00b1 0.18 for the RRc stars\nand [Fe/H]ZW = \u22121.76 \u00b1 0.13 for the RRab stars were obtained. The problem of the Jurcsik & Kov\u00e1cs (1996) calibration of eq. 2 giving values of [Fe/H] too large by \u223c 0.2-0.3\ndex for very metal poor stars has been discussed particularly\nfor the RRab stars in NGC 5053 by Nemec (2004), whose\nresult [Fe/H]=\u22121.73 is very similar to ours (\u22121.76). This\nissue has also been pointed out by Jurcsik & Kov\u00e1cs (1996)\nthemselves, Kov\u00e1cs (2002) and for other clusters by Cacciari\net al. (2005) (M3), L\u00e1zaro et al. (2006) (M2), Arellano Ferro\net al. (2008a) (NGC 5466) and Arellano Ferro et al. (2008b)\n(NGC 6366). It is also interesting to note that a good agreement between the Fourier and spectroscopic [Fe/H] values\nfor the LMC RR Lyrae stars was found by Gratton et al.\n(2004) and Di Fabrizio et al. (2005) after a systematic correction of \u223c \u2212 0.2 dex was applied to the Fourier values.\n\n\fCCD Photometry of NGC 5053\n\n5\n\nTable 3.

See text for discussion.\n\nTherefore, applying such correction to the mean value of\n[Fe/H] for the RRab one obtains [Fe/H]ZW = \u22121.96 \u00b1 0.13.\nFor the RRc stars, we used the calibration of Morgan\net al.

The present result also\nindicates that while the cluster is certainly very metal-poor,\nthe extreme deficiency ascribed to it earlier is not supported.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c631 is the phase in a series of cosines, and P the period\nin days. This calibration provides iron abundances in the\nmetallicity scale of Zinn & West (1984) (ZW) with a standard deviation of 0.14 dex. The iron abundances [Fe/H]ZW\nfor the RRc stars are reported in Table 5. We find a value\nof [Fe/H]ZW = \u22121.97 \u00b1 0.18 in excellent agreement with the\nvalue derived from the analysis of the RRab stars after the\ncorrection discussed above. The calibration of Morgan et al.\n(2007) has been applied to RRc stars in M15 (-2.12) (Arellano Ferro et al. 2006) and NGC 5466 (-1.92) (Arellano Ferro\net al. 2008a) and has proven to yield values in very good\nagreement with generally accepted and well established values from different techniques.\n\n4.2\n\nVisual absolute magnitudes and luminosities\n\nThe luminosity, or absolute magnitude, for the RRc stars\nwas calculated using the empirical calibration of Kov\u00e1cs\n(1998)\n(s)\n\nMV (K) = 1.261 \u2212 0.961 P \u2212 0.044 \u03c621 \u2212 4.447 A4 , (4)\nwith a standard deviation of 0.042 mag.\nTo bring the scale of eq. 4 into agreement with the\nmean magnitude for the RR Lyrae stars in the LMC, V0 =\n19.064\u00b10.064 (Clementini et al. 2003), it has been necessary\nto decrease the zero point by 0.2\u00b10.02 mag (Cacciari et al.\n2005).

If the MV values in Table 5 are compared with\nthe ones obtained by Nemec (2004) for the same stars after\nwe subtract 0.2 mag from Nemec's results (labelled as K98\nin his Table 14), it can be seen that the two sets of results\nagree to within \u223c 0.02 mag.\nFor the RRab stars we have used the calibration of\nKov\u00e1cs & Walker (2001):\nMV (K) = \u2212 1.876 log P \u2212 1.158 A1 + 0.821 A3 + K, (5)\nwhich has a standard deviation of 0.04 mag.\nThe zero point of eq. 5, K = 0.43, has been calculated by Kinman (2002) using the star RR Lyrae as a\ncalibrator adopting for RR Lyrae the absolute magnitude\nMV = 0.61 \u00b1 0.10 mag, as derived by Benedict et al. (2002)\nusing the star parallax measured by the HST. If one adopts\n< V >= 19.064 for the RR Lyraes in the LMC and a value\nof [Fe/H]=\u22121.5 (Clementini et al. 2003), then correcting to\n[Fe/H]=\u22121.39 for RR Lyrae (Benedict et al. 2002) one obtains < V >= 19.088. Hence, the value K = 0.43 corresponds to a distance modulus of 19.088 \u2212 0.61= 18.48 mag.\nTo make our calculations of the luminosities for the RRab\nstars consistent with the above values and the distance modulus of 18.5 for the LMC (Freedman et al. 2000), we adopted\nK = 0.41 in the application of eq. 5. The MV (K) values for\nthe RRab stars are given in Table 4. The average MV (K) is\n0.49\u00b10.06 mag. This result is, within the observational scatter, in good agreement with the mean absolute magnitude\nfound for the RRc stars of 0.55 \u00b1 0.05 mag.\nThe values of MV (K) in Tables 4 and 5 were transformed into log L/L\u2299 . The bolometric corrections for the\naverage temperatures of RRc and RRab stars were estimated\nfrom the calibration for metal poor stars of Montegriffo et\n\u2299\nal. (1998). We adopted the value Mbol\n= 4.75.\n4.3\n\nThe effective temperature Teff\n\nlog Teff = 3.9291 \u2212 0.1112 (V \u2212 K)o \u2212 0.0032 [F e/H]\n\n(7)\n\nwith\n(s)\n\n(V \u2212 K)o = 1.585 + 1.257 P \u2212 0.273 A1 \u2212 0.234 \u03c631\n(s)\n\n+ 0.062 \u03c641 .\n\n(8)\n\nEq. 7 has a standard deviation of 0.0018 (Jurcsik 1998), but\nthe uncertainty in log Teff is mostly set by the uncertainty\nin the colour from eq. 8. The error estimate on log Teff is\n0.003 (Jurcsik 1998).\nIt has been pointed out by Cacciari et al. (2005) that\nthe temperatures computed from the above equations do\nnot match the colour-temperature relations predicted by the\ntemperature scales of Sekiguchi & Fukugita (2000) or by\nthe evolutionary models of Castelli (1999). This was in fact\ncorroborated by Arellano Ferro et al (2008a) who concluded\nthat the Fourier based temperatures for the RRc need to be\nreduced by as much as \u223c 300 K. In the present paper we\nexplore the colour temperatures from our V, I data and the\nVandenBerg, Bergbusch & Dowler (2006) HB models, and\nwe perform a comparison with the Fourier temperatures for\nboth RRc and RRab stars.\nThe value of A0 in eq. 1 and in Table 3 corresponds in\nfact to the magnitude-weighted (V ) mean magnitude. The\nvalues of (I) are listed in Table 6. To deredden the mean\nmagnitudes we have adopted E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.018 (Nemec\n2004) and have calculated the colour ratio E(B \u2212 V )/E(V \u2212\nI) = 1.58 from the colour ratios given by Barnes, Evans &\nMoffett (1978). The values of (V \u2212 I)0 for the sample RR\nLyraes are also given in Table 6.\nTo convert the observed (V \u2212 I)0 to effective temperatures we have followed Nemec (2004) in the use of the HB\nmodels of VandenBerg, Bergbusch & Dowler (2006) with the\ncolour-log Teff relations as described by VandenBerg & Clem\n(2003). The model with [Fe/H]=\u22122.012 and [\u03b1 /H]=0.3 was\nadopted with a polynomial fit of the form:\ny = A0 +A1 x+A2 x2 +A3 x3 +A4 x4 +A5 x5 +A6 x6 +A7 x7 (9)\n\nThe effective temperature of RRc and RRab stars can also\nbe calculated from the Fourier decomposition technique.\nHowever, some problems have been identified with the calibrations of RRc stars as we shall discuss below.\nFor the RRc stars, the calibration of Simon & Clement\n(1993) can be used:\n(c)\n\nlogTeff = 3.7746 \u2212 0.1452 log P + 0.0056 \u03c631 .\n\n(6)\n\nFor the RRab stars we used the calibration of Jurcsik\n(1998)\n\nwhere y= log Teff , x=(V \u2212 I)0 and the coefficients A0 =\n3.9867, A1 = \u22120.9506, A2 = +3.5541, A3 = \u22123.4537, A4 =\n\u221226.4992, A5 = +90.9507, A6 = \u2212109.6680 and A7 =\n+46.7704.

These results indicate that for the\nRRc stars the Fourier based temperatures are on average\n\u223c 255K hotter than the V I colour temperatures, whereas\nfor the RRab stars the agreement is better with the Fourier\nbased temperatures being on average \u223c 40K cooler.\nThe distribution of the RR Lyrae stars in the instability\nstrip is shown in Fig. 3. Two positions have been plotted\nfor each star; for log Teff (F ou) (triangles) and log Teff (V I)\n(circles). Three models of the Zero Age Horizontal Branch\n(ZAHB) from VandenBerg, Bergbusch & Dowler (2006) for\n[Fe/H]=\u22121.836, [Fe/H]=\u22122.012 and [Fe/H]=\u22122.310 all for\n[\u03b1/Fe]=+0.3 are plotted. The instability strip borders for\nthe fundamental mode and first overtone are also shown\n(Bono et al. 1995). The distribution of the RRc and the\nRRab stars resulting from the use of log Teff (F ou) values\n(triangles) looks clumpy. The RRc stars are too blue and\nthe large gap between the RRc and RRab stars is contrary\nto observational evidence in clusters with larger populations\nof RR Lyrae stars. For instance, in M3, the distribution of\nRR Lyrae stars across the instability strip is more even, and\nsome fundamental mode and first overtone pulsator stars\nshare the inter-mode region (Cacciari et al. 2005). The use\nof the colour temperatures log Teff (V I) (circles) produces a\nlarger spread in the RRc stars but not in the RRab stars,\nwhich indicates that the Fourier based temperatures for the\nRRab stars are consistent with the colour temperatures. The\ncolour temperatures distribute the RRc stars more evenly\naccross the instability strip.\n\n4.4\n\nThe radius R/R\u2299\n\nGiven the stellar luminosity and the effective temperature, the stellar radius can be estimated via the expression log R/R\u2299 = [log (L/L\u2299 ) \u2212 4log (Teff /Teff \u2299 )]/2. With\nthe Fourier decomposition based values of log(L/L\u2299 ) (or\nMV for RRab) and Teff (F ou), one can derive the stellar\nradii log(R/R\u2299 )(F ou). These radii depend fully on the semiempirical relations and the hydrodynamical models used to\ncalculate the luminosity and the temperature.\nAn alternative calculation of the radii can be performed\n\n3.793\n3.802\n3.802\n3.786\n\nFigure 3. RR Lyrae stars in the HRD for NGC 5053. Solid symbols represent RRab stars and open symbols RRc stars. The triangles were plotted using the Fourier based temperatures, while\nthe circles correspond to colour temperatures calculated from the\n(V \u2212I)0 index. The vertical boundaries are the fundamental mode\n(continuous lines) and first overtone (dashed lines) instability\nstrips from Bono et al. (1995) for 0.65 M/M\u2299 .

These radii we shall\ndenote as log(R/R\u2299 )(V I).\nA yet completely independent approach to the RR\nLyrae radii determination is through the Period-RadiusMetallicity (PRZ) calibrations of Marconi et al. (2005) which\nare based on nonlinear convective models (e.g. Bono et al.\n2003). Two calibrations are offered; for the first overtone pulsators or RRc stars: log R/R\u2299 = 0.774 + 0.580 log P \u2212 0.035\nlog Z, and for the fundamental pulsators or RRab stars: log\nR/R\u2299 = 0.883 + 0.621 log P \u2212 0.0302 log Z. We converted\nthe individual values of [Fe/H]ZW into Z making use of the\nequation: log Z = [Fe/H] \u2212 1.70 + log(0.638 f + 0.362), where\nf is the \u03b1-enhancement factor with respect to iron (Salaris\net al. 1993) which we adopt as f = 1.

For the RRab\nstars, log(R/R\u2299 )(F ou) and log(R/R\u2299 )(P RZ) agree within\ntheir uncertainties (solid triangles). On the other hand, the\nradii from the colour temperatures, log(R/R\u2299 )(V I), are in\nagreement with log(R/R\u2299 )(P RZ) for both the RRc and\nRRab stars (circles). These results add a word of caution\nfor the temperatures obtained from the calibrations of eq. 6,\nbut confirm that the temperatures for the RRab stars from\neqs. 7 and 8 seem consistent with theoretical predictions as\npointed out in \u00a7 4.3.\n4.5\n\nThe mass M/M\u2299\n\nFourier-based masses of the RRc stars can be estimated by\nthe calibration of Simon & Clement (1993):\n(c)\n\nlog M/M\u2299 = 0.52 log P \u2212 0.11 \u03c631 + 0.39,\n\n(10)\n\nand for the RRab stars by the calibration of Jurcsik (1998);\nlog M/M\u2299 = 20.884 \u2212 1.754 log P + 1.477 log (L/L\u2299 )\n\u2212 6.272 log Teff + 0.367 [F e/H].\n\n(11)\n\nCacciari et al. (2005) have argued that the masses obtained for RR Lyrae stars from the above relations and the\nFourier decomposition of their light curves are not reliable.\n\n0.77\n0.70\n0.66\n0.66\n\nIn order to test these relations in the same way as for the\neffective temperature, one can compare these masses with\nthose predicted by the fundamental equation of stellar pulsation of van Albada & Baker (1971):\nlog M/M\u2299 = 16.907 \u2212 1.47 log PF + 1.24 log (L/L\u2299 )\n\u2212 5.12 log Teff\n\n(12)\n\nwhere PF is the fundamental period. In order to apply this\nequation to the first overtone pulsators RRc, their periods\nwere transformed to the fundamental mode by adopting the\nratio P1H /PF = 0.748, which is the average ratio for the\ndouble mode RR Lyrae stars in M15 (Cox et al. 1983). Note\nthat the difference between eq. 12 and the calibration of\nJurcsik (1998) in eq. 11 is that the later includes the iron\ndependence, and therefore a comparison of the two relations\nis of interest. However, after the discussion in \u00a7 4.3 and \u00a7\n4.4 of the temperature scale, the major concern is how the\nmass is affected by the chosen temperature scale.\nThe values of the masses are reported in Table 7. For\nthe RRc stars the Fourier mass M/M\u2299 (F ou) (eq. 10) and\nthe pulsational mass M/M\u2299 (P ul) (eq. 12) agree within 10%.\nSince M/M\u2299 (P ul) depends on the temperature, we calculated them using the colour temperatures log Teff (V I). However, if the Fourier temperatures log Teff (F ou) are used instead, the resulting Fourier masses would be more than 20%\ntoo small. This also demonstrates that the Fourier temperatures for the RRc (eq. 6) are inaccurate.\nFor the RRab stars the Fourier mass M/M\u2299 (F ou)\n(eq. 11 with Fourier temperature), the colour-temperature\nbased masses M/M\u2299 (V I) (eq. 11 with colour temperature),\nand the pulsational mass M/M\u2299 (P ul) (eq. 12 with colour\ntemperature) are all listed in Table 7. We notice that although the largest differences between the average of colourtemperature based masses (M/M\u2299 (VI) and M/M\u2299 (Pul))\nminus the Fourier masses (M/M\u2299 (Fou)) are +14% for V3\nand \u221215% for V5, the average difference including the four\nRRab stars is only \u22123%.\nIn conclusion, the Fourier temperatures for the RRc\nstars (from eq. 6 of Simon & Clement (1993) seem to be\n\u223c 250K too hot relative to the colour-temperature calibration based on calculations from theoretical models of\nthe HB. This is confirmed by the temperature-dependent\nFourier radii and masses when compared with their pulsa-\n\n\fCCD Photometry of NGC 5053\nTable 8.

However, contrary to the\nsuggestion by Cacciari et al. (2005), and despite the larger\nscatter in the difference between the colour-temperature\nmasses and the Fourier masses compared to the case for the\nradii, we do not find evidence that the Fourier temperatures\nfor RRab stars from equations 7 and 8 are significantly different from the colour temperatures. The radii and masses\nbased on the Fourier temperatures are comparable to their\npulsational estimates.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nTHE BLUE STRAGGLERS AND SX\nPHOENICIS STARS\nPeriods of the SX Phe stars\n\nFour SX Phoenicis (SX Phe) in NGC 5053 were discovered\nby Nemec (1989) and a fifth one was later found by Nemec et\nal. (1995). Nemec et al. (1995) determined the main period\nand discussed the period changes. With our new collection of\nhigh quality light curves we believe that we are in a position\nto revisit these subjects.\nThe light curves of the SX Phe stars from our data\nset are displayed in Fig. 5. We have used the Phase Dispersion Minimisation (PDM) approach (Burke et al. 1970;\nDworetsky 1983) to first estimate the variability parameter\nSQ and the period. With the aim of confirming the PDM\nresult and of searching for multiple frequencies we have also\nused the program PERIOD04 (P4) (Lenz & Breger 2005)\non the present data for the five known SX Phe. The final\nperiods found by P4 are listed in column 3 of Table 8. The\nuncertainties are \u223c 0.00001 days. The periods found by Nemec et al. (1995) are also listed. The differences in period\nare real due to the intrinsic period variations of the stars\nand the 20-25 years elapsed between the two data sets. Due\nto the irregular nature of the variations, likely due to the\npresence of other undetected frequencies, the light curves in\nFig. 5 are not folded with the periods listed in Table 8.\nMost likely due to the time distribution of our data set,\nwe found only one frequency in the known SX Phe except\nfor NC13.\nFor NC13 the period from the PDM method is 0.03421d.\nThe frequencies from the PERIOD04 method are given in\nTable 9 and correspond to the periods 0.03396d (in agreement with the PDM result), 0.03465d and 0.02680d. The\npower spectrum corresponding to these periods is shown in\nFig. 7 (left). The main frequency and the third one are in\nthe ratio f1 /f3 = 0.789 and therefore they are likely to be\nthe fundamental mode and the first harmonic.\n\n9\n\n5.2\n\nFrequency\n(c/d)\n\nAmplitude\n(mag)\n\nMode\n\n29.44274\n\u00b10.00005\n28.85900\n\u00b10.00007\n37.31934\n\u00b10.00012\n\n0.044\n\nF\n\n0.030\n\nNon radial\n\n0.015\n\n1H\n\nPeriod changes in the SX Phe stars\n\nA first attempt to analyse the period changes in the SX Phe\nstars in NGC 5053 was made by Nemec et al. (1995). Since\nnearly two decades have elapsed between the data employed\nby these authors and the present data, we have decided to\nrevisit the subject.\nThe times of maximum light employed by Nemec et\nal. (1995) are not explicitly given in their paper and we\nfound that it was inaccurate to try and recover them from\ntheir phase diagrams. Instead we opted for inspecting their\nlight curves and estimating the times of maximum. The same\nprocedure was performed on the present light curves in Fig.\n5. The times of maximum are reported in Table 10.\nIn order to build the O-C diagrams of Fig. 6, the periods\nof Nemec et al. (1995) and the first time of maximum were\nadopted as initial ephemerides. Since the pulsational periods\nare very short and the time elapsed between the two data\nsets is quite large, the counting of cycles is sometimes uncertain. In Fig. 6 the O-C values that we consider the most\nlikely ones are plotted as solid black circles but alternative\nvalues resulting from the addition or subtraction of one cycle are also plotted as open circles. The uncertainty of each\nindividual data point was estimated by Nemec et al. (1995)\nto be about 0.1P. However, our estimations of several times\nof maximum from a single night show a larger dispersion\nindicated by the vertical error bars in the figure. We believe\nthis is a more conservative and realistic estimate of the individual uncertainties. Brief comments on the period changes\nof each star are given below\nNC7. The O-C diagram for this star suggests that the\nadopted period is incorrect. However, the amount by which\nthe period is incorrect depends on the cycle counting. In\nFig. 6 we show three possibilities. There is no convincing\nevidence for a secular period change.\nNC11. Based on the first two points of the O-C diagram\nNemec et al. (1995) could not argue in favour of a period\nchange. The latest group of O-C data however make a rather\nconvincing case for a period decrease at a rate of -0.101\nd/Myr.\nNC13. Nemec et al. (1995) found that the period of this\nstar is increasing. However we find no evidence of an upward\nparabola on the O-C diagram but rather a downward one\nimplying a period that decreases at a rate of -0.011 d/Myr.\nNevertheless the open circles on Fig. 6 show how fragile that\nconclusion might be. A miscounting of one cycle would imply\n\n\f10\n\nA. Arellano Ferro et al.\n\nFigure 5. V (black circles) and r (red circles) light curves of the known SX Phe stars in NGC 5053 as obtained in the present work. In\norder to highlight the variations, the r light curves have been offset in magnitude such that the mean r magnitude matches the mean V\nmagnitude for each star. Mean uncertainties for the V and r data points are plotted at the start of the light curve for clarity.\n\nthat the period does not to change at all or changes at a\ndifferent rate.\nNC14. Like NC7, depending upon the cycle counting,\nthree possibilities for the secular behaviour of the period are\nshown in Fig. 6. If the parabolas are real then the period\nchange rates are -0.008 or -0.0417 d/Myr for the two presented cases. However, given the uncertainties in the times\nof maximum light, three straight lines of different slopes are\nalso possible.\nNC15. Although other possibilities are indicated by the\nO-C diagram of this star in Fig. 6, it seems that the parabolic\nfit is a reasonable solution. In that case the rate of period\ndecrease would be -0.084 d/Myr.\nAll the above period change rates suggested by the\nparabola fits imply new periods that differ from the\n\nephemerides by about \u00d710\u22127 days or less, and therefore the\nnew periods cannot be confirmed based exclusively on the\ndata of the present paper.\n\n5.3\n\nThe Blue Stragglers\n\nThere are 28 blue stragglers (BS) reported in NGC 5053, 26\nof which are identified by Nemec & Cohen (1989) and Nemec\net al. (1995). Five of these BS are the SX Phe variables\ndiscussed in \u00a7 5.1. Three BS stars were found by Sarajedini\n& Milone (1995) but their star number 25 is the same as\nBS25, thus to avoid confusion we shall include Sarajedini &\nMilone SM26 and SM27 as BS27 and BS28 respectively. We\nhave paid special attention to the identification of each of\nthe BS in our images and our data file collection since some\n\n\fCCD Photometry of NGC 5053\n\n11\n\nFigure 6.

We have correctly\nfound the corresponding V , r and I files for 25 of the 28 BS\nsince BS20 lies off the field of our images and BS16 is very\nnear to the image border. BS28 very unfortunately falls on\na column of bad pixels on the CCD chip in the I reference\nimage, and therefore we only have V and r light curves.\n\nThe identified stars are then highlighted in Fig. 8 as solid\nyellow circles, open black circles or solid green squares (see\ncaption). The region enclosed by dashed lines in Fig. 8 is\nthe blue straggler region according to Harris (1993) for the\ncluster NGC 6366, but adapted to the brightness and colour\nof NGC 5053. 21 of the 25 measured BS stars fall within the\n\n\f12\n\nA.

They are plotted as solid yellow\ncircles for easy identification. Through our dedicated effort\ntowards the identification of these stars, we conclude that\nthese four stars are not likely to be Blue Stragglers.\nOn the other hand we have found three stars in the BS\nregion not previously identified as BS stars. These are shown\nas crosses in Fig. 8 and, to continue with the adopted name\nconvention, in what follows we shall refer to them as BS29,\nBS30 and BS31.\n\n6\n\nby the SQ method. We will analyse the BS stars in \u00a7 6.1.\nThe V light curves for all stars with SQ < 0.35 were visually inspected (black crosses) and only two are convincing\nvariables; NV1 (solid red circle) and BS4. Their periodicities\nwill be discussed below.\nFig. 10 shows the logarithm of the standard deviation\nof the mean (log \u03c3) as a function of mean magnitude. Stars\nwith large dispersion for a given magnitude are good candidates to be variable. This figure, in combination with Fig.\n9 can be used to identify new variables. In Figs. 9 and 10\nwe also plot the RR Lyrae stars, SX Phe stars, BS stars\nand the new variables that will be discussed in detail in the\nforthcoming sections.\n\nSEARCH FOR NEW VARIABLES\n\nAll the V light curves of the nearly 6500 stars measured\nin each of the 151 images available were analysed by the\nphase dispersion minimisation approach (Burke et al. 1970;\nDworetsky 1983). In this analysis the light curve is phased\nwith numerous test periods within a given range. For each\nperiod the dispersion parameter SQ is calculated. When SQ\nis at a minimum, the corresponding period is the best-fit\nperiod for that light curve. Bona fide variable stars should\nhave a value of SQ below a certain threshold. Similar analysis has been used and described in detail in previous papers\n(e.g. Arellano Ferro et al. 2008a;b, 2006). In Fig. 9 the distribution of the SQ parameter for the whole sample of stars\nis shown. As expected the RR Lyrae stars (solid blue circles)\nhave the smallest values of SQ. However it should be noted\nthat the five known SX Phe stars (solid green circles) all\nhave large values of SQ despite their variability. Likewise,\nthe BS stars (solid turquoise circles) present large values of\nSQ, and hence their possible variability cannot be ruled out\n\n6.1\n\nVariability among BS stars\n\nApart from the 5 stars identified as SX Phe among the BS\nstars, Nemec et al. (1995) suspected variability in the stars\nBS12, BS21 and BS25. We explored each BS star light curve\nin our collection and found clear indications of variability in\nsome of them. In what follows we will discuss their periodicities and in Table 11 we summarise the properties of the\nwhole collection of confirmed and new BS stars. It should\nbe stressed however, that variables in the BS region often\nshow multiple frequencies and small amplitudes, e.g. SX Phe\nstars, and that our light curve sampling is far from ideal to\nestablish complicated frequency patterns; although the time\nspan is three years, the inter-run gaps are large and hence\nthe window function is complicated. This problem was also\na limitation of the period determination by Nemec et al.\n(1995), hence in depth study of the frequency content of the\nvariable BS stars, including the known SX Phe stars, long\nmultisite observing campaigns would be required.

A new RGV, NV1, is shown as a solid\nred circle.\n\naim to find/confirm the variability among the BS stars and\nto determine the main periodicity, although in a few cases,\nwe are able to detect a second frequency.\nThe BS stars have mean V magnitudes between 18 and\n20. In this range the magnitude errors are between 0.01 and\n0.04 mag (see Fig. 10). Keeping this in mind, we have classified the BS stars as variable, suspect variable and nonvariable. We confirm the variability of BS25 suspected by\nNemec et al. (1995), and we also find variability in BS4, BS5,\nBS19, BS28, and in the newly discovered BS stars BS29 and\nBS30. In Fig. 10, known and new BS stars are shown as\nsolid turquoise circles except for the variable ones that are\nlabelled and represented by solid yellow circles. We describe\nbelow our attempts to find their periodicities.\nOur approach to determining the periodicities of the\nBS stars involves a PDM analysis of the light curve to find\na first estimate of the period. Then P4 was run as a confirmation and to search for other frequencies. Since the period\nrange in 149 SX Phe stars in Galactic globular clusters is between 0.03 and 0.14d (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez & L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez 2000),\nwe started searching in this range. However, for specific cases\nshorter or longer periods were explored. We address each\nstar individually in the following paragraphs.\n6.1.1\n\nPeriodicities in variable BS stars\n\nThe light curves of the variable BS stars are shown in Fig.\n11.\n\n13\n\nBS4\n\nFigure 9.

No clear short periods are visible in the light curve\nand instead we find long term mean magnitude changes. Two\nPDM periods are found; 0.07014d and 0.52382d. While the\nfirst period is typical of an SX Phe star, it does not produce\na coherent folded light curve. On the other hand P4 finds\na period of 1.10354d which is nearly twice the longer PDM\nperiod. In Fig. 12 the V, r, I light curves are phased with the\nephemerides HJDmax =245 3833.3057+ 0.52382E, although\nthe period 1.10354d cannot be ruled out.\nBS5. Variations with a characteristic time of the order\nof 0.1d are visible in the light curve. In fact the light curve\nis similar to that of the SX Phe star NC14 in Fig. 5. The\nPDM period is 0.12659d while P4 finds 0.02308, 0.03847\nand 0.12678d. One cannot apriori favour any one of these\nperiods, although we note that if the star is indeed a SX Phe,\nas suggested by its position on the CMD, then the period\n0.03847d would be the most consistent with the expectation\nfrom the PL relationship for SX Phe (see \u00a7 6.2).\nBS19. The light variation is very evident. The PDM\nperiod is 0.07877d. P4 finds a prominent peak at 0.60889d,\nand after prewhitening, a peak at 0.02929d appears. This\n\nFigure 12. Folded V, r, I light curves of two newly identified\nvariables.\n\nis a similar case to that of BS4 but the phasing with the\nlonger period 0.60889d does not produce a convincing light\ncurve. If the short period is confirmed with more data then\nthe star might be an SX Phe star.\nBS25. This star is in a crowded region but it can be well\nmeasured by our difference imaging technique. In fact, the\naverage magnitude uncertainties for this V =18.7 mag star\nare among the smallest for the BS stars; 0.013 and 0.024 in\nV and r respectively. Therefore the variations, although of\nsmall amplitude, are likely to be real and we carried out a\nsearch for the periodicity. The PDM period is 0.17224 while\nP4 finds a substantial peak at 0.20821d and a secondary\npeak at 0.04521. The later period would be consistent with\nthe first harmonic of a SX Phe star of the brightness of BS25,\naccording to the SX Phe P L relation (see \u00a7 6.2).\nBS28. The light curve shows signs of variability. Some\nepochs are missing because the star falls near a bad pixel column in the chip and then in some images the photometry is\nunreliable. The PDM analysis indicates a period of 0.17425d.\nP4 finds two major peaks at 0.20408d and 0.04547d. The star\nis probably an SX Phe.\nBS29. Clear signs of variability are seen in the light\ncurve. The PDM period is 0.142412d. P4 finds a strong peak\nat 0.034110d which is nearly one fourth of the PDM period.\nPrewhitening the main period one finds 0.18477d (see Fig.\n7). It is likely that these two frequencies are real. The star\nis a new BS star and likely an SX Phe.\nBS30. Clear signs of variability are also seen in the\nlight curve of this star. The PDM period is 0.07290d. P4\nfinds a strong and substantial peak at 0.45045d (A=0.0215\nmag). Prewhitening the major frequency one finds 0.02535d.\nThe period 0.45045d does not fold the light curve at all and\ntherefore it must be a spurious alias. The shorter period is\nlikely to be correct. This is a new BS star and very likely an\nSX Phe.\n\n\f16\n\nA. Arellano Ferro et al.\n\nFigure 13. V (black circles) and r (red circles) light curve of suspect variable BS stars in NGC 5053 as obtained in the present work.\nIn order to highlight the variations, the r light curves have been offset in magnitude such that the mean r magnitude matches the mean\nV magnitude for each star. Mean uncertainties for V and r data points are plotted at the start of the light curve for clarity.\n\n6.1.2\n\nPeriodicities in suspect variable BS stars\n\nThe light curves of the suspect variable BS stars in Fig. 13.\nBS22. Considering the average magnitude uncertainties indicated in the figure, mild indications of variability\nare seen in light curve, especially when the V and r data are\ncombined. We decided to perform a period search in the V\ndata. The PDM period is 0.15580d. P4 finds 0.07725d and\na competing period is 0.16155d. As for the other BS stars,\nthe removal of the main frequency leaves substantial signal in the power spectrum, suggesting the presence of other\nfrequencies which we are unable to determine with the available data. The star is not a BS star as it sits on the turn\noff region on its way to the RGB. Its variability will require\nconfirmation with a more appropriate data set.\nBS23. Similar to BS22, the variations in BS23 are mild.\nThe PDM period is 0.12102d. P4 shows three competing\npeaks in the main structure of the power spectrum at periods\n0.12561, 0.11365 and 0.10287d. The star is not a BS star as\nit lies in the turn off region (see Fig. 8).\nBS31. The mean magnitude uncertainties for this star\nare 0.018 and 0.036 mag in V and r respectively, which implies that the observed variations are probably real. The\nPDM period is 0.02574d, which is too short for an SX Phe\nstar. P4 indicates two competing periods of 0.04556d and\n0.05105d. The later is about twice the PDM period and\nhence the most likely period. If the variation and period\nare confirmed then this star might be an SX Phe.\n\n6.2\n\nThe SX Phe P L relation and the distance to\nNGC 5053\n\nIt is known that SX Phe stars follow a tight relation between\ntheir fundamental mode, first overtone periods and their luminosity (McNamara 1995). Due to the mixture of modes,\nthe Period-Luminosity (P L) relation is difficult to determine. Of particular relevance to the present work is the calibration that Jeon et al. (2004) calculated for seven SX Phe\nin NGC 5466; MV = \u22123.25(\u00b10.46) logP \u2212 1.30(\u00b10.06) (\u03c3 =\n0.04), because the distance and iron content of NGC 5466\n(16.06 \u00b1 0.09 kpc and \u22121.91 \u00b1 0.19; Arellano Ferro et al.\n2008a) are almost identical to our values determined for\nNGC 5053 (16.75\u00b10.39 kpc and \u22121.97\u00b10.16). A P L dependence on [Fe/H] has been proposed by Nemec et al. (1994)\nof the form: MV = \u22122.56(\u00b10.54) logP + 0.36 + 0.32[Fe/H].\nIn Fig. 14 we have plotted the logarithm of the period\n(column 4 Table 11) vs. the mean magnitude (V ) (column\n2 Table 11) for the 5 known SX Phe stars and the BS stars\nidentified as SX Phe stars in \u00a7 6.1. The calibrations of Jeon\net al. (2004) and Nemec et al. (1994) are shown as continuous and dashed lines respectively and have been scaled to\nthe case of NGC 5053 using a distance modulus of 16.125\nand E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.018. It can be seen that the SX Phe\nstars in NGC 5053 follow the above two relations. The most\ndiscordant stars would seem to be BS5 and BS25. However,\ntheir periods found in \u00a7 6.1 seem to correspond to the first\novertone, as suggested by the first overtone calibration of\n\n\fCCD Photometry of NGC 5053\n\n17\n\nNV1. On the CDM this star is on the RGB. Its PDM\nperiod of 0.66578d phases the variations well in all filters\n(Fig. 12). No evidence of more frequencies was found with\nthe data on hand. P4 suggests two peaks at 1.69426d and\n0.63921d, none of which phase the light curve as well as the\nPDM period.\nIn Fig. 15 we display a finding chart for the eight RR\nLyrae stars studied, the five previously known SX Phe stars,\nthe variable BS stars, the three new BS stars and the new\nvariable NV1.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nFigure 14. Period-Luminosity relation for the SX Phe stars in\nNGC 5053. Filled circles represent the known SX Phe stars. Open\ncircles represent the newly identified SX Phe stars among the BS\nstars. Two positions are shown for BS5 and BS25 for the first overtone period (open circles) and the fundamental period (crosses).\nThe two continuous lines correspond to the first overtone and\nfundamental mode relations of Jeon et al. (2004) and the dashed\nline represents the relation of Nemec et al. (1994).\n\nJeon et al. (1994). Their periods can be converted to the\nfundamental mode via the ratio P1H /PF = 0.783 (Jeon et\nal. 2004), and then the stars also seem to follow the fundamental mode relation (crosses in Fig. 14).\nThe distribution of the BS stars along the P L relations\nfor SX Phe stars confirms their SX Phe nature. Since the\nperiod for the SX Phe stars in NGC 5466 is better determined than for the SX Phe stars in NGC 5053, rather than\nattempting an independent calibration of the P L relation,\nthe SX Phe (known and newly discovered) can be used to\nestimate the distance to NGC 5053.\nThe application of the P L relations of Jeon et al. (2004)\nand of Nemec et al. (1994) lead to the average distances of\n16.36 \u00b1 0.85 and 16.08 \u00b1 0.98 kpc respectively. Although\nthese determinations of the distance cannot compete in precision with the determination from the RR Lyrae stars, it is\nrewarding to find that the agreement is good to within the\nuncertainties.\n\n6.3\n\nOther new variables\n\nIn Fig. 10 it can be observed that above the main stream\nthere are numerous points which may be variables. An exploration of all of the corresponding data files up to V\u223c 20\nshows that often the large sigmas are produced by a few occasional spurious measurements, particularly in stars near to\nthe border of our images, or near to saturated or to authentic variable stars, and are not due to intrinsic variability.\nHowever, we find one star suspected of real variations as\naddressed below.\n\nDISCUSSION\nOn the distance to NGC 5053\n\nTo determine the distance to the cluster we have calculated\nthe distance modulus (A0 \u2212 MV ) for each RR Lyrae star,\nusing the absolute magnitudes MV (K) given in Tables 5 and\n4, and the mean magnitudes A0 from Table 3. We used the\nextinction ratio R=3.2 and the value of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.018\nwas adopted from Nemec (2004).\nWe find mean true distance moduli of 16.12 \u00b1 0.05 and\n16.12 \u00b1 0.03, which correspond to distances of 16.71 \u00b1 0.39\nkpc and 16.75\u00b10.26 kpc for the RRc and RRab stars respectively. The uncertainties quoted for these values correspond\nto the standard deviation of the mean. These values of the\ndistance are consistent with the mean luminosity of the RR\nLyrae stars in the LMC Vo = 19.064 \u00b1 0.064 (Clementini\net al. 2003) and a distance modulus of 18.5 \u00b1 0.1 mag for\nthe LMC (Freedman et al. 2001; van den Marel et al. 2002;\nClementini et al. 2003).\nIn his catalogue of parameters of globular clusters, Harris (1996) lists a distance of 16.4 kpc for NGC 5053, which\ncomes from the assumption of V (HB)=16.65 (Sarajedini &\nMilone 1995), [Fe/H]=\u22122.29, R=3.0, E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04 and\nthe relation MV = 0.15[Fe/H] + 0.80. His calculation is\nmostly sensitive to the values of [Fe/H] and E(B \u2212V ). If the\ncalculation is repeated with the value [Fe/H]=\u22121.97, and depending upon the assumed value of E(B \u2212 V ) between 0.018\nand 0.04 mag, one obtains a distance in the range 16.04 to\n16.53 kpc. No significant differences are found if a reasonably\ndifferent MV -[Fe/H] relation is used.\nThe Fourier results for the distance are independent\nof the iron abundances however, they seem to support the\nestimate made using low metallicity.\n\n7.2\n\nOn the age of NGC 5053\n\nWe have estimated the age of the cluster by a direct comparison of the cluster's CMD with the theoretical isochrones of\nVandenBerg, Bergbusch & Dowler (2006) as shown in Fig.\n16. To properly align the theoretical isochrones with the observed distribution of stars, we aligned the most blue point\non the isochrones with the Turn Off (TO) point. Indeed, the\nmain source of uncertainty in this procedure is in the location of the TO point. In fact, Rosenberg et al. (1999) report\nthat the TO point of NGC 5053 is at V = 20.00 \u00b1 0.06 and\n(V \u2212 I) = 0.545 \u00b1 0.004. This TO point is shown in Fig. 16\nas a solid white circle and indicates that the best fit model\nis for an age of \u223c 16 Gyrs, as shown in the bottom panel.\nThe age seems much too large when compared to the most\n\n\f18\n\nA. Arellano Ferro et al.\n\nFigure 15. V image of NGC 5053 obtained at the Indian Astrophysical Observatory at Hanle, India. The size is approximately 11\u00d711\narcmin2 . All RR Lyrae stars are identified with prefix V, Blue Stragglers with prefix BS, and the five previously known SX Phe stars\nwith prefix NC. The two BS stars found by Sarajedini & Milone (1995) are BS27 and BS28. The three new BS stars found in this work\nare BS29, BS30 and BS31. The rest of the Blue Stragglers are clearly identified by Nemec & Cohen (1989).\n\nrecent differential calculations of globular cluster ages (as\nwe shall see below) which further implies that the adopted\nTO point is too red.\nWe have attempted our own estimate of the location of\nthe TO point. We adopted V = 20.0, but for the (V \u2212 I)\nvalue we proceeded as follows; the mean uncertainties in our\nphotometry at V = 20.0 and I = 19.5 are 0.04 and 0.05 mag\nrespectively, and hence the uncertainty in (V \u2212 I) is \u223c 0.06\nmag, which is represented by the horizontal error bars shown\nin Fig. 16. To allow for this uncertainty in the colour, we\nhave shifted the TO point from the bluest point of the bulk\nof stars at V = 20.0, by 0.06 mag redwards. In the top panel\nof Fig. 16 we have fixed the isochrones on this new TO point\nas we did in the bottom panel. The best fit of the RGB would\nbe for a model of age between 12 and 14 Gyrs. The best fits\nfor 12 Gyrs and 14 Gyrs would be obtained for shifts of the\nTO from the bluest point of 0.05 and 0.09 mag respectively.\nA linear interpolation in between these two models for 0.06\nmag gives an age of 12.5 Gyrs. The uncertainty attached to\nthis estimate is related to the uncertainty in the location\nof the TO point due to uncertainties in the photometry.\nShifting the TO point \u00b10.03 mag would correspond to an\nuncertainty of about \u00b12.0 Gyrs in the age estimation.\nA differential version of the vertical and horizontal\n\nmethods for globular cluster age determination for a family of Galactic globular clusters can be found in the work of\nRosenberg et al. (1999). NGC 5053 is included in the cluster\nsample used by these authors who estimate an average age\nfor the cluster of \u22120.9 \u00b1 0.07 Gyrs relative to the absolute\nage of a group of coeval clusters assumed to have an age of\n13.2 Gyrs as in Carretta et al. (2000). In other words, their\nestimate for the age of NGC 5053 is 12.3 \u00b1 0.7 Gyrs. These\nauthors consider NGC 5053 to be a member of the coeval\ngroup.\nThe CMD in Fig. 16 is comparable to the CMD of the\ncluster published by Rosenberg et al. (2000), which is to be\nexpected since we have used the same set of standard stars.\nThe Rosenberg et al. (2000) diagram was used by Rosenberg et al. (1999) to estimate the age of the cluster. The\nhorizontal fiducial lines in Fig. 16 from the bottom upwards\ncorrespond to the TO point, the fiducial point on the RGB\n2.5 mag above the TO point (RGB2.5 ), and the level of the\nHB respectively. We have estimated the age sensitive vertical\nHB\nand horizontal parameters \u2206VTO\n= TO \u2212 HB = 3.35 \u00b1 0.05\nmag and \u03b4(V \u2212 I)2.5 = RGB2.5 \u2212 TO = 0.359 \u00b1 0.050 mag,\nthat can be compared with those estimated by Rosenberg et\nal. (1999) as 3.30 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.310 \u00b1 0.007 respectively. It is\nclear that vertically our results agree well and hence similar\n\n\fCCD Photometry of NGC 5053\n\n19\n\nages would be found. However, due to the substantially different horizontal position of the TO point, a large difference\nis exhibited between the values of the \u03b4(V \u2212 I)2.5 parameter. Despite this discrepancy, our estimate agrees well with\ntheir horizontal estimate of the age of 12.6 \u00b1 0.5 Gyrs. This\nis probably due to the fact that, despite Rosenberg et al.'s\n(1999) absolute estimation of the mean age for the group of\ncoeval clusters from the horizontal parameter and a comparison with the models of Straniero et al. (1997) and VandenBerg et al. (1990) of 13.1 and 16.4 Gyrs respectively, they\nadopt an age for the coeval group of 13.2 Gyrs, and then\nestimate individual cluster ages differentially. Our estimate\nfor the age of NGC 5053 agrees well within the uncertainties\nwith the final average age given by Rosenberg et al. (1999).\nAnother age estimate for NGC 5053 obtained by employing a differential approach is that of Salaris & Weiss\n(2002) who found an age of 10.8 \u00b1 0.9 Gyrs. The most recent differential age calculation for 64 galactic globular clusters was made by Mar\u0131\u0301n-Franch et al. (2009) using four sets\nof stellar evolution libraries. These authors find an average\nrelative age ANGC 5053 /Abulk = 0.96 \u00b1 0.04, and using the\nmodels of Dotter et al. (2007), they calculated a mean absolute age for the low metallicity clusters of 12.8 \u00b1 0.17 Gyrs,\nfrom which one can calculate an age of 12.29 \u00b1 0.17 Gyrs for\nNGC 5053.\nThere is reasonable agreement between our result of\n12.5 \u00b1 2.0 Gyrs with the three independent and more accurate differential age estimates of 12.3 \u00b1 0.7 Gyrs (Rosenberg\net al. 1999), 10.8 \u00b1 0.9 Gyrs (Salaris & Weiss 2002) and\n12.29 \u00b1 0.17 Gyrs (Mar\u0131\u0301n-Franch et al. 2009).\n\n8\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe technique of difference imaging has proven to be a powerful tool in providing accurate photometry down to about\nV = 20 mag and in finding new variables. In this paper we\nreport the discovery of five SX Phe stars among the BS stars,\ntwo of which are new BS stars, and one new red semiregular\nvariable.\nPhysical parameters of astrophysical relevance such as:\nlog (L/L\u2299 ), log Teff , MV , R/R\u2299 , M/M\u2299 and [Fe/H], have\nbeen derived for the RR Lyrae stars in NGC 5053 using\nthe Fourier decomposition of their V light curves. Special\nattention has been paid to the calibration of these parameters onto widely accepted scales. It has been found that Teff\nfor the RRc stars from the calibration of Simon & Clement\n(1993) cannot be reconciled with the theoretical predictions\nfor the boundaries of the instability strip. However, the\nFourier temperatures for RRab stars from the calibration\nof Jurcsik (1998) agree well with the colour temperatures,\nand they imply radii and masses comparable to those derived from pulsational models.\nThe average iron abundance [Fe/H] = \u22121.97 \u00b1 0.16 is\nfound from the RRab and RRc stars. This value may appear too large for a cluster often considered the most metal\ndeficient in the Galactic halo. However, this value is in good\nagreement, within the uncertainties, with the most recent\naccurate estimates from spectroscopic data.\nA distance of 16.7\u00b10.3 kpc is found from the Fourier approach to the determination of MV for the RR Lyrae stars.\nThis value is in agreement, within uncertainties, with pre-\n\nFigure 16. Isochrones from models with [Fe/H]= \u22122.012 and\n[\u03b1/Fe]=0.3 of VandenBerg, Bergbusch & Dowler (2006). The ages\nof the isochrones are identified at the RGB from right to left as 12,\n14, 16 and 18 Gyrs. The bottom panel shows the models aligned\nwith the turn off point (TO) of Rosenberg et al. (2000) (solid\nwhite circle). In the top panel the models are aligned with the TO\npoint calculated in the present paper. The error bars correspond\nto the mean uncertainties of the V and I photometry at V = 20.0\nmag and I = 19.5 mag. See text for discussion.\n\ndictions from the MV -[Fe/H] relation for values of [Fe/H]\n\u223c \u22122.0.\nWe report five new SX Phe stars and show that they\nfollow the period luminosity relationship of SX Phe stars in\nNGC 5466, a cluster very similar in age and metallicity to\nNGC 5053. If the P L calibration is applied to the SX Phe\nin NGC 5053, then the estimated distance is found in good\nagreement with the distance from the RR Lyrae stars.\nOur (V \u2212 I) CMD and the isochrones of VandenBerg,\nBergbusch & Dowler (2006) indicate an age of 12.5\u00b12.0 Gyrs\nfor the cluster, which is in good agreement with independent\ndifferential age estimations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the support astronomers of IAO, at Hanle\nand CREST (Hosakote), for their efficient help while acquiring the data and to the referee for the detailed revision and\nvery useful suggestions.
