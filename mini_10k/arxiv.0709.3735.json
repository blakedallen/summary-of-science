Gabriel, 2.2.1]), generalizing a result for finite commutative algebraic groups by M. Demazure & P. Gabriel ([DG, II, \u00a71, 2.10]).\nAll functors we consider are functors defined over the category of commutative\nk-algebras. Given a k-module E, we denote by E the functor of k-modules E(B) :=\nE \u2297k B. Given two functors of k-modules F and H, Homk (F, H) will denote the\nfunctor of k-modules\nHomk (F, H)(B) = HomB (F|B , H|B )\nwhere F|B is the functor F restricted to the category of commutative B-algebras.\nWe denote F \u2217 := Homk (F, k). It holds that E\u2217\u2217 = E ([A1, 1.10]). Given E there\nexists a k-module V such that E = V\u2217 if and only if E is a projective k-module of\nfinite type.\nGiven a functor of commutative k-algebras A, we define Spec A to be the functor\nSpec A(B) := Homk\u2212alg (A, B). Let X = Spec A be a k-scheme and let X * be its\nfunctor of points (X * (B) := Homk\u2212alg (A, B)). It is easy to see that X * = Spec A.\nIf C\u2217 is a functor of commutative algebras, we prove (Theorem 1.6) that Spec C\u2217\nis a direct limit (of functor of points) of finite k-schemes.\nIf A = A, in [A1, 3.4] we proved that the linear enveloping of Spec A is A\u2217 , that\nis,\nHomf unctors (Spec A, H) = Homk (A\u2217 , H)\nfor all dual functors of k-modules H (i.e., H = F \u2217 ). If in addition G = Spec A is\nan affine k-group, in [A1, 5.4] we proved that the algebraic enveloping of Spec A is\nA\u2217 again, that is,\nHommonoids (Spec A, B) = Homk\u2212alg (A\u2217 , B)\nfor all dual functors of k-algebras B. As a consequence, we obtained that the\ncategory of G-modules is equivalent to the category of A\u2217 -modules.\nIn this paper we prove simultaneously the same results for A = A, C\u2217 (Corollary\n2.4, Proposition 2.7, Theorem 2.8). In particular,\nHomf unctors (Spec A, k) = Homk (A\u2217 , k) = A.\nMoreover, if Spec A is a functor of abelian monoids, then we get\nHommonoids (Spec A, k) = Homk\u2212alg (A\u2217 , k) = Spec A\u2217\nwhere k is regarded as a functor of monoids with the multiplication operation.\nGiven a functor of monoids H, we say that H \u2217 = Hommonoids (H, k) is the dual\nfunctor of monoids of H and we prove the following theorem.\nDate: June, 2007.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 14L15. Secondary 20M07, 22D35.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAMELIA \u00c1LVAREZ, CARLOS SANCHO, AND PEDRO SANCHO\n\nTheorem 1. The category of abelian affine monoids G = Spec A is anti-equivalent\nto the category of functors Spec C\u2217 of abelian monoids. The functors giving the\nanti-equivalence are the ones that assign to each functor of monoids its dual functor\nof monoids.\nIn particular, G\u2217\u2217 = G.\nFinally, we get three immediate applications of the functorial Cartier duality:\n(1) The tangent space to G\u2217 at the identity element is isomorphic to the vector\nspace V of linear functions of G.\n(2) If car k = 0 and G is a unipotent abelian k-group, then it is isomorphic to\nthe dual of V .\n(3) If G is semisimple, then the transposed Fourier transform of G\u2217 is the\ninverse of the Fourier transform of G.\n1. Spectrum of a functor of algebras\nThe basic references for reading this paper are [A1] and [S].\nLet k be a commutative ring with unit. If E is a k-module we will say that E is a\ncuasi-coherent k-module. The category of k-modules is equivalent to the category of\ncuasi-coherent k-modules ([A1, 1.12]). In particular, Homk (E, E\u2032 ) = Homk (E, E \u2032 ).\nE\u2217 = Homk (E, k) is the functor of points of the scheme Spec Sk* E and we say that\nit is a k-module scheme. As it holds that E\u2217\u2217 = E, the category of cuasi-coherent\nmodules is anti-equivalent to the category of module schemes ([A1, 1.12]) .\nNotation 1.1. Throughout this paper we assume that A\u2217 is a commutative kalgebra scheme (equivalently, A is a cocommutative k-coalgebra, [A1, 4.2]). From\nProposition 1.5 on, we will always assume that A is a projective k-module.\nDefinition 1.2. Given a functor of k-algebras A, the functor Spec A, \"spectrum\nof A\", is defined to be\n(Spec A)(B) := Homk\u2212alg (A, B)\nfor each commutative k-algebra B.\nExample 1.3. If C is a commutative k-algebra, then\nSpec C = (Spec C)* .\nExample 1.4. Let X be a set. Let us consider the discrete topology on X. Let X\nbe the functor, which we will call the constant functor X, defined by\nX (B) := Apliccont. (Spec B, X)\nfor each commutative k-algebra B.\nLet AX be the functor of algebras defined by\nAX (B) := Aplic(X, B) =\n\nY\n\nB\n\nX\n\nfor each commutative k-algebra B. Let us observe that AX =\n\nQ\n\nk = (\u2295k)\u2217 is a\nX\n\nX\n\ncommutative algebra scheme.\nLet us prove that Spec AX = X .\nThe morphisms of functors of k-algebras are, in particular, morphisms of functors of k-modules\nY\n(Spec AX )(B) = Homk\u2212alg (AX , B) \u2282 Homk (AX , B) = Homk (\nk, B)\nx\u2208X\n\nand from [A1, 4.5] we know that morphisms of functors of k-modules from\n\nQ\nk to\nX\n\nB factorize through the projection onto a finite number of factors. Therefore, given\n\n\fFUNCTORIAL CARTIER DUALITY\n\na morphism\n\n3\n\nQ\nk \u2192 B there exists a subset Y \u2282 X of finite order, such that we get\nX\n\nthe factorization\n\nY\nY\nk\u2192\nk \u2192 B.\nX\n\nY\n\nEvery continuous morphism Spec B \u2192 X has finite image, because Spec B is compact and X is discrete. We can assume that X is a finite set.\nThus, we get\nY\nY\nHomk\u2212alg ( k, B) = Homk\u2212alg ( k, B)\nX\n\nX\n\n= Cont.Aplic.Spec k (Spec B, Spec\n\nY\nX\n\nk=\n\na\n\nSpec k)\n\nX\n\n= Apliccont. (Spec B, X).\nLater we will see that the ring of functions of Spec AX coincides with AX , that\nis,\nHomf unctors (Spec AX , k) = AX .\nProposition 1.5. Let A a functor of commutative algebras. Then, Spec A =\nHomk\u2212alg (A, k).\nProof. By the adjoint functor formula ([A1, 1.15]) (restricted to the morphisms of\nalgebras) it holds that\nHomk\u2212alg (A, k)(B) = HomB\u2212alg (A|B , B) = Homk\u2212alg (A, B)\n= (Spec A)(B).\n\u0003\nTherefore, Spec A\u2217 = Homk\u2212alg (A\u2217 , k) \u2282 Homk (A\u2217 , k) = A.\nIf E is a finitely-generated k-module, we will say that E is coherent.\nTheorem 1.6. Let A\u2217 be a commutative algebra scheme and let us assume that A\nis a projective k-module. By [A1, 4.12], A\u2217 = lim Ai , where Ai are the coherent\n\u2190\u2212\ni\n\n\u2217\n\nalgebras that are quotients of A . It holds that\nSpec A\u2217 = lim Spec Ai .\n\u2212\u2192\ni\n\nProof. By [A1, 4.5], the image of every k-linear morphism A\u2217 \u2192 B is a coherent\nk-module; therefore, every morphism of functors of k-algebras A\u2217 \u2192 B factorizes\nthrough a coherent algebra Ai that is a quotient of A\u2217 . Then,\n(Spec A\u2217 )(B) = Homk\u2212alg (A\u2217 , B) = lim Homk\u2212alg (Ai , B)\n\u2212\u2192\ni\n\n= lim (Spec Ai )(B).\n\u2212\u2192\ni\n\n\u0003\nProposition 1.7. Let B be a functor of commutative k-algebras. Then,\n(1) Homf unctors (Spec A, Spec B) = Homk\u2212alg (B, A).\n(2) Homf unctors (Spec A\u2217 , Spec B) = Homk\u2212alg (B, A\u2217 ).\nProof. It holds that Homf unctors ((Spec A)* , F ) = F (A) for every functor F , by\nYoneda's lemma.\n\n\f4\n\nAMELIA \u00c1LVAREZ, CARLOS SANCHO, AND PEDRO SANCHO\n\n(1)\nHomf unctors (Spec A, Spec B) = Homf unctors ((Spec A)* , Spec B)\n= Homk\u2212alg (B, A).\n(2)\nHomf unctors (Spec A\u2217 , Spec B) = Homf unctors (lim Spec Ai , Spec B)\n\u2212\u2192\ni\n\n= lim Homf unctors (Spec Ai , Spec B)\n\u2190\u2212\ni\n\n= lim Homk\u2212alg (B, Ai )\n\u2190\u2212\ni\n\n= Homk\u2212alg (B, A\u2217 ).\n\u0003\nProposition 1.8. For A = A, A\u2217 , it holds that\nHomf unctors (Spec A, k) = A.\nProof.\nHomf unctors (Spec A, k) = Homf unctors (Spec A, Spec k[x])\n= Homk\u2212alg (k[x],A) = A.\n\u0003\nExplicitly, A = Homf unctors (Spec A, k), w 7\u2192 w\u0303, where w\u0303(\u03c6) = \u03c6(w), for every\n\u03c6 \u2208 Spec A = Homk\u2212alg (A, k).\n2. Closure of dual modules and algebras\nDefinition 2.1. We will say that a functor of k-modules F is dual if there exists\na functor of k-modules H such that F \u2243 H \u2217 .\nProposition 2.2. Let F be a functor of k-modules such that F \u2217 is a reflexive\nfunctor. The closure of dual functors of k-modules of F is F \u2217\u2217 , that is, it holds the\nfunctorial equality\nHomk (F, G) = Homk (F \u2217\u2217 , G)\nfor every dual functor of k-modules G.\nProof. Let us write G = H \u2217 , then\nHomk (F, G) = Homk (F, H \u2217 ) = Homk (H, F \u2217 ) = Homk (H, F \u2217\u2217\u2217 )\n= Homk (F \u2217\u2217 , H \u2217 ) = Homk (F \u2217\u2217 , G).\n\u0003\nDefinition 2.3. Let F be a functor of sets. We will denote by k[F ] the functor\nover the category of commutative k-algebras defined by k[F ](B) = {formal finite\nB-linear combinations of f \u2208 F (B)}.\nCorollary 2.4. Let A be a functor of commutative k-algebras. Let us assume that\nHomf unctors (Spec A, k) = A and that A is a reflexive functor of k-modules.Then,\nthe closure of dual functors of k-modules of k[Spec A] is A\u2217 , that is,\nHomf unctors (Spec A, F ) = Homk (k[Spec A], F ) = Homk (A\u2217 , F )\nfor every dual functor of k-modules F .\nProof. As k[Spec A]\u2217 = Homf unctors (Spec A, k) = A, the closure of dual functors\nof k-modules of k[Spec A] is k[Spec A]\u2217\u2217 = A\u2217 .\n\u0003\n\n\fFUNCTORIAL CARTIER DUALITY\n\n5\n\nProposition 2.5. Let F be a functor of k-algebras such that F \u2217 is a reflexive\nfunctor of k-modules. The closure of dual functors of k-algebras of F is F \u2217\u2217 , that\nis, it holds the functorial equality\nHomk\u2212alg (F, G) = Homk\u2212alg (F \u2217\u2217 , G)\nfor every dual functor of k-algebras G. In particular, Spec F = Spec F \u2217\u2217 .\nProof.

Therefore, the morphism S\u0304 n (I\u2217 /I\u22172 ) \u2192 (I\u2217n )\u2032 /(I\u2217n+1 )\u2032 is surjective.\n\u2217\n\u22172\nn \u2217\n\u22172\nIf I\u2217A /I\u22172\nA \u2192 IB /IB is a surjective morphism, then the morphisms S\u0304 (IA /IA ) \u2192\nn \u2217\n\u22172\nS\u0304 (IB /IB ) are surjective and from the commutative diagram\nS\u0304 n (I\u2217A /I\u22172\nA)\n\nepi\n\n// S\u0304 n (I\u2217 /I\u22172 )\nB B\nepi\n\nepi\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// I\u2217n /I\u2217n+1\nB\nB\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u2217n+1\nI\u2217n\n/I\nA\nA\n\n\u2217n+1\n\u2217n+1\nit is deduced that the morphisms I\u2217n\n\u2192 I\u2217n\nare surjective.

Let G = Spec A be an abelian k-group and let k be an algebraically\nclosed field of characterisic zero. Then, there exists an isomorphism of k-groups\nY\nG = ( Ga ) \u00d7 D\nX\n\nwhere D is a diagonalizable group.\nProof. We must prove that if G is unipotent, then it is isomorphic to a direct\nproduct of additive groups.\nThus, we have that A\u2217 is local. Let I\u2217 be its radical. The morphism i : G \u2192 1 +\n\u2217 \u22172\nI /I , i(g) = 1+g \u2212 1 is a morphism of k-groups. Let us prove that it is an isomorphism. Consider k as the trivial G-module. Then, E := Der(G, k) = Homlin (G, k).\nThe ring of functions of 1 + I\u2217 /I\u22172 = I\u2217 /I\u22172 is \u2295n S n E. The morphism between\nthe rings induced by i is the natural morphism \u2295n S n E \u2192 A. Dually, we have the\n\n\fFUNCTORIAL CARTIER DUALITY\n\n11\n\n\u2217\nmorphism A\u2217 \u2192 k[[E\u2217 ]] =: B\u2217 .

Inversion formula\n\nLet B \u2286 J k be a quasi-coherent k-algebra (with or without unit). We define\nSpec B to be the functor over the category of commutative algebras (with unit)\n(Spec B)(C) := {f \u2208 Homk\u2212alg (B, C) : (Imf ) = C}.\nQ\nIf k is a field it is easily seen that Spec B = Spec J k if and only if B = \u2295J k.\nDefinition\n5.1. We will say that \u2295J k is the cuasi-coherent ring of functions of\nQ\nSpec J k.\nQ\nAs well,Q\u2295J k is characterized by being the maximal quasi-coherent J k-submodule of J k. Q\n\u2217\n\u2217\nLet G\u2217 = Spec J k be a functor of discrete\nQ groups. G operates on G by\ntranslations on the left, then it\nPoperates on J k, then on \u2295J k. The mapping\nwG\u2217 : \u2295J k \u2192 k, wG\u2217 ((\u03bbi )) = i \u03bbi is the only G\u2217 -invariant linear form up to a\nmultiplicative factor.

If G is also commutative, then A\u2217 = J k and\nIm \u03c6G = \u2295J k =: A\u2032 . Let e : A \u2192 k the identity element of G (that is, the unit of\nA\u2217 ).

The transposed Fourier transform of the dual group of a semisimple\nabelian k-group is the inverse of the Fourier transform of the semisimple abelian\ngroup.\nProof. \u03c6G\u2217 (\u03c6G (a))(w) = wG\u2217 (\u03c6G (a) * w) = wG\u2217 (\u03c6G (a * w)) = (a * w)(e) = a(w) for\nall a \u2208 A and w \u2208 A\u2217 .\n\u0003\nReferences\n[A1] \u00c1lvarez, A., Sancho, C., Sancho, P., Algebra schemes and their representations, J.
