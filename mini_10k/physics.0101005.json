If angular momentum is conserved,\nthen a metastable well is formed by the centrifugal barrier and the dielectric/air interface; quasi-bound states\nwithin this well decay only by tunneling (evanescent leakage) [7]. If the dielectric is deformed, angular momentum\nis no longer conserved and such a state may emit \"over\nthe barrier\" by refraction, a \"classically allowed\" process. Light emission via refraction is non-tangent to the\ninterface, whereas that via tunneling is always tangential. Our observation of spatially displaced non-tangent\nlaser emission is a signature of new types of lasing modes\nin this system unique to the deformed case.\nA CWGM is a solution of the wave equation corresponding to an ensemble of rays in a chaotic region of\nphase space; and the lifetime of such modes is, for large\nenough deformation, limited by refractive escape [6]. For\na deformed cylindrical resonator, such a mode obtained\nby exact numerical solution of the wave equation, is depicted in Fig. 1(a). Superimposed on a surface of section (SOS) of the phase space for ray motion, we show\nthe Husimi function of the mode [8], which is a projection of the exact wave solution for a resonant mode\nonto this SOS. As can be seen in Fig. 1(a), the mode\nis localized away from the critical angle for total internal reflection, \u03c7c , but its tail leaks downwards to \u03c7c in a\nhighly anisotropic fashion, leading to directional emission [4,6] [see the inset of Fig 1(a)]. Previous work\nanalyzed anisotropic emission patterns from deformed\nlasing droplets [3] and dye jets [4] and found results\nconsistent with, but not unique to, lasing from chaotic\nmodes. Rather recently, deformed cylindrical semiconductor lasers [9] were found to exhibit highly directional\nand high-power output, but feedback was provided by a\nmode associated with a non-chaotic \"bow-tie\" orbit.\nThe main problem with interpreting observations from\nmicrolasers with deformed resonators is that highly directional emission may also be obtained with non-chaotic\nray dynamics such as an elliptically-deformed cylinder\n[see Fig. 1(b)]. It is thus desirable to find a distinct\nsignature of lasing from chaotic modes. One such signature [4,6] is illustrated by the SOS in Figs. 1(a) and\n1(b). In the SOS of Fig. 1(a), the islands which represent orbits near stable periodic paths prevent the entry\nof ray flux from the chaotic regions (neglecting weak tunneling effects). This effect can displace the rays of such\na chaotic mode from the points of highest curvature at\n\nBy combining detailed imaging measurements at different tilt angles with simulations of ray emission from prolate\ndeformed lasing micro-droplets, we conclude that the probability density for the lasing modes in a three-dimensional\ndielectric microcavity must reside in the chaotic region of the\nray phase space. In particular, maximum emission from such\nchaotic lasing modes is not from tangent rays emerging from\nthe highest curvature part of the rim. The laser emission is\nobserved and calculated to be non-tangent and displaced from\nthe highest curvature due to the presence of stable orbits. In\nthis Letter we present the first experimental evidence for this\nphenomenon of \"dynamical eclipsing\".\n42.55.Sa,05.45.Mt,42.15.-i,42.25.-p\n\nBoth the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the wave equation\nof optics share the property that their short wavelength\nlimit corresponds to a Hamiltonian dynamics: classical\nNewtonian mechanics in the former case and ray-optics\nin the latter. When that dynamics is non-integrable, relating properties of the wave solutions to the classical\ndynamics is very difficult and has been an area of intense study under the rubric quantum/wave chaos [1]. Of\nparticular interest recently is the generic non-integrable\ncase of a mixed phase space in which chaotic and regular regions coexist. It was noted [2\u20136] by several of the\nauthors that an interesting problem in optics, the resonance and emission properties of deformed spherical and\ncylindrical dielectric resonators, was just such a problem\nin wave chaos theory with a mixed phase space, with resonant modes corresponding to both regular and chaotic\nregions of phase space. It was predicted [3,5,6] that in\na substantial parameter range deformed micro-cylinder\nand micro-spherical lasers would actually lase on a certain type of chaotic mode which we refer to as \"chaotic\nwhispering gallery modes\" (CWGMs). In this Letter, we\nreport for the first time laser emission patterns unique\nto the CWGM of deformed micro-droplet lasers. The\nlaser emission from CWGMs is found to be non-tangent\nand its emission location is displaced from the points of\nhighest curvature where most of the laser emission from\nregular whispering gallery modes occurs.\nWhispering gallery modes (WGMs) are solutions of the\nwave equation which classically correspond to rays circulating around the boundary reflecting at high angle of\nincidence; in the dielectric resonator such modes have\n\n1\n\n\fFIG. 2.

The lasing\nmicrodroplets are viewed at various polar angles (\u03b8D ) by\nusing a CCD camera. 2D imaging is essential to determine the emission locations, which cannot be provided by\na single-photodiode experiment. The experimental setup\nis shown in Fig. 2 where the polar plane is defined to\nbe the Y-Z plane. Variation of the polar angle \u03b8D of the\nimaging direction is achieved by fixing the camera, but\ntilting the droplet generator about the pump laser direction (X-axis), which preserves the same (non-uniform)\npumping condition at all tilt angles. Simultaneous images were taken in two directions: (I-1) along the X-axis\nand (I-2) along the (-Y)-axis, which were then brought\nside by side with a beam splitter (BS) to the single CCD\ncamera. While the shape and the tilt of the droplets were\nmonitored by (I-1), the desired lasing images at various\nvalues of \u03b8D are obtained from (I-2).\nWe only present data for prolate droplets, for which\nthe longest axis goes through the poles; similar effects\nare seen in oblate droplets but are not presented here\ndue to space limitations. Taking the long axis as the\nz-axis, rotational symmetry implies that ray orbits can\nbe classified by the conserved z-component of the angular momentum, Lz [3]. The near-polar orbits of interest\ncorrespond to Lz \u2248 0, since they correspond to motion\nin a plane passing near or through the z-axis. Experimentally, lasing in a particular Lz -mode can be excited\nby aiming a tightly focused pump laser beam along the\ndroplet rim as shown in Fig 2, which subsequently enters the droplet with \u03c7 \u2248 \u03c7c and fixes Lz to a value of\nr sin \u03b8 sin \u03c7c , where r(\u03b8) is the distance from the droplet\ncenter to the surface (Lz in these units is equal to the\n\nwhich generically high emission would be expected to occur. We refer to the scenario of Fig.1(a) as dynamical\neclipsing. This displacement of the chaotic mode rays\nalso has a dramatic effect on the laser emission pattern,\nwhich can be determined experimentally by taking images of the microcavity at various angles.\nThe identical ray dynamics underlying Fig. 1(a) for\na two-dimensional (2D) microstructure also occurs in a\nplane that cuts an axisymmetric quadrupole-deformed\ndroplet from pole to pole through a meridian (polar\nplane). Such droplets made of ethanol (refractive index, n = 1.36) containing laser dye are ejected from\nthe vibrating orifice of a Berglund-Liu droplet generator [10], oscillating in shape [3]. The dominant multipole components of this hydrodynamic oscillation [11] are\nquadrupolar and octupolar with damping time constants\n\u03c4 = 213 \u03bcsec for the quadrupole and \u03c4 = 39 \u03bcsec for\nthe octupole. For times t > 100 \u03bcsec during which the\nexperiments were performed, the shape deformation is\nessentially purely quadrupolar, and is uniquely parameterized by the aspect ratio, b/a, where b and a are the\nsemimajor and -minor axes. A particular b/a can be selected by observing the droplets stroboscopically at the\nproper phase of their shape oscillation.\nTo detect dynamical eclipsing in the polar plane of such\ndeformed droplets it is necessary to measure both emis2\n\n\fdistance of closest approach of the rays to the z axis [3]).\nBecause Lz of such a pump beam is conserved after entering the droplet, this input beam generates the highest\ngain for lasing modes with the same Lz . For example\n(see Fig. 2), when pumped at the equatorial rim, lasing\noccurs in modes with Lz \u2248 a sin \u03c7c in which rays are\nconfined to the equatorial plane; when pumped tangentially near \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 , lasing occurs in Lz \u2248 0.5 a modes for\nwhich rays precess [12] around the z-axis due to non-zero\ntorque exerted on the rays at each bounce. In the the\nLz = 0.5 a case, the lasing mode is still regular and rays\nencounter highest curvature near the highest (\u03b8 = 45\u25e6 ) or\nlowest (\u03b8 = 135\u25e6 ) latitudes of the orbits and thus escape\ntangentially through tunneling at these points [13].\nIn order to demonstrate dynamical eclipsing, nearpolar modes (Lz \u2248 0) are excited with a focused pump\nbeam aimed at the north pole. In this case the ray motion\nis that of an effective 2D cavity of aspect ratio b/a \u2248 1.3\nformed by the intersection of the droplet with the polar plane, and is identical to the parameters used in Fig.\n1(a). No laser emission is observed in I-1, but intense\nlaser emission is observed from the bottom of I-2 (see\nFig.2). Such an emission pattern indicates that main lasing emission does not occur from the highest curvature\npoints (north pole or south pole), but away from these\npoints, consistent with the prediction of dynamical eclipsing in Fig 1(a). To explain this in more detail, note first\nthat there exists a four-bounce stable diamond-shaped\norbit for rays in the polar plane [Fig. 1(c)], which can\nsupport stable resonant modes; however these modes do\nnot provide sufficient feedback for lasing because of the\nlarge refractive leakage near the pole. Specifically, the\nround-trip loss for the four-bounce orbit is 4.6, which is\nsignificantly greater than the estimated maximum roundtrip gain of 0.9 for 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M Rhodamine B dye solution in ethanol. However, chaotic orbits launched with\n\u03c7 \u226b \u03c7c can undergo multiple (more than 100) reflections before they reach \u03c7c . Therefore, the leakage loss\nof a CWGM is much less than the round-trip gain, and\nconsequently, lasing can occur with feedback provided by\nchaotic modes. However, the non-lasing four-bounce stable diamond orbits displace the laser emission location of\nthe CWGMs [see Fig. 1(a), (c)]. Regular WGMs with\n\u03c7 \u2248 90\u25e6 still exist for Lz \u2248 0 and lase for this deformation; however their leakage rate is much smaller than the\nabsorption rate. The fact that the north and south pole\nis dark indicates the emission from such regular WGM is\nat least two orders of magnitude weaker than that from\ndynamically eclipsed CWGM for Lz \u2248 0.\nFigure 3 shows additional results consistent with this\ninterpretation of dynamical eclipsing of CWGMs; in this\ncase an unfocused beam was used to excite all the possible Lz -modes. For the experimental images at \u03b8D = 90\u25e6 ,\nthe bright regions along the droplet rim are due to a superposition of laser emission from precessing modes at\ndifferent Lz .

(a) Experimental lasing images (I-1 and I-2) of\nbroadly-pumped (beam diameter: > 100 \u03bcm) prolate droplets\n(b/a = 1.29) are shown for \u03b8D = 90\u25e6 , 122\u25e6 , and 146\u25e6 (pump\nlaser was vertically polarized and f/16 lens was used). Corresponding calculated lasing images (I-2) at \u03b8D = 90\u25e6 , 120\u25e6 ,\nand 150\u25e6 are shown for quadrupole (b) and elliptic (c) deformations. In the simulation, equally mixed TE and TM\npolarizations were used to calculate Fresnel coefficients for\nthe emerging laser rays.\n\nthe rim near the two poles indicates the absence [3] of\nsuch regular precessing modes with \u03c7 \u2248 \u03c7c near Lz = 0.\nA very different emission pattern is seen in I-2 at tilt\nangles of \u03b8D = 122\u25e6 and 146\u25e6 ; here we see substantial\nemission in the plane bisecting the poles of the droplet\nalong the imaging direction; such emission can only come\nfrom Lz \u2248 0 orbits. Moreover the fact that the Lz \u2248 0\nemission is not seen at \u03b8D = 90\u25e6 insures that the emission does not come from the poles (the points of highest\ncurvature), but displaced from the two poles in a manner\nconsistent with the dynamical eclipsing scenario.\nRay simulations of refractive emission for the unfocused pumping case were performed for the quadrupole\nshape [Fig. 3(b)] and ellipsoid [Fig. 3(c)]. Uniformly\ndistributed rays in \u03b8 and Lz were launched with initial\n\u03c7 greater than \u03c7c . The lasing condition was imposed in\nthe ray simulations by including only orbits which have\npathlength (before refractive escape) greater than 1/g,\nwhere the gain is estimated to be g \u2248 45 cm\u22121 . Ray\nescape was determined by Snell's law and the relevant\nFresnel coefficients at each reflection. Note that in the\nquadrupole simulations, there is strong emission near the\nbottom center of the image at \u03b8D = 146\u25e6 and no emission\nat the poles of the image at \u03b8D = 90\u25e6 , in good qualitative agreement with the experiments [14]. In contrast,\nthe ellipsoid simulation shows that most of the refractive\nemission occurs at \u03b8D = 90\u25e6 , and essentially no emission is found at \u03b8D = 146\u25e6 in distinct contrast with our\nexperimental results. This result provides crucial support for our interpretation of the images as arising from\ndynamical eclipsing. The ray motion in the ellipsoid is\ncompletely regular, with no chaotic regions and no fourbounce stable islands [see Fig. 1(b)]; hence dynamical\n\n3\n\n\fthe ellipse [see the inset of Fig. 1(b)]. In Fig. 4(b),\nlasing images at \u03b8D = 142\u25e6 are shown for various b/a;\n1.07, 1.20, and 1.29. For b/a = 1.07, the entire rim of\nthe droplet up to the poles is bright in I-1, while no laser\nemission is recorded in I-2 [note the similarity to the ellipsoid simulations in Fig. 3(c)]. Thus we find a range of\nintermediate deformations with highly anisotropic emission, but no dynamical eclipsing, which is then turned on\nby increasing b/a.\nIn summary, laser emission from a quadrupoledeformed spherical microcavity is observed to be partially\nnon-tangent and displaced from the highest curvature regions. This provides for the first time conclusive evidence\nof lasing supported by chaotic whispering gallery modes.\nThese modes are displaced from the high curvature points\nby stable high-loss modes, an effect known as dynamical\neclipsing. The unique angular dependence of the lasing\nimages is in good agreement with simulated images of\nlasing quadrupolar droplets with chaotic ray dynamics.\nWe would like to acknowledge the partial support of\nNSF (Grant PHY-9612200).\n\nFIG. 4. (a) Images of broadly-pumped lasing prolate\ndroplets ( b/a = 1.29) at \u03b8D = 142\u25e6 with various f-numbers\n(f/16, f/8, f/4/, and f/2). Because the solid angle of light\nacceptance is proportional to \u2248 1/(f /#)2 , the color intensity\nscale for each f/# is adjusted accordingly. The depth of field\n[\u221d (f /#)2 ] for each f/# is shown relative to the droplet size.\nThe imaging direction is on the right of the droplet. (b) Lasing images of broadly-pumped prolate droplets with various\naspect ratios. Dynamical eclipsing is not present for small\ndeformation (b/a = 1.07).\n\neclipsing does not occur and one finds only tangent emission from the poles [Fig. 1(b), inset].\nTo further confirm that the emission seen at large\ntilt angles is non-tangent and hence refractive as we expect from CWGMs, we have varied the depth of field,\ndf /# , and the acceptance angle (f-number) of the imaging system. In Fig 4(a), images are shown with various\ndf /# 's for a lasing prolate droplets with b/a = 1.29 at\n\u03b8D = 142\u25e6 . The f-number of the camera lens was changed\nfrom f/2 (df /2 = 10 mm, 14% of the droplet size along\nthe imaging axis) to f/16 (df /16 = 600\u03bcm, covering the\nwhole droplet). While the bright emission is sharply imaged at the bottom center of the image with f/16, f/8,\nand f/4, the corresponding emission is blurred with f/2.\nFrom this we conclude that this laser emission is emitted\nfrom outside of the region defined by df /2 . If such emission propagates parallel to the imaging axis, the emitted\nrays are non-tangent. For the f/16 image, the emission\ndirection is restricted to within 2\u25e6 from the imaging axis.\nLaser emission from the displaced location implied by the\ndf /# analysis above is non-tangent by as much as 10\u25e6 30\u25e6 . Therefore, dynamically eclipsed rays from CWGM\nare non-tangent up to 30\u25e6 , which indicates refraction is\nthe major escape mechanism.\nFurther confirmation comes from the aspect-ratio dependence of the patterns [Fig. 4(b)]. For moderate deformations the islands become too small to generate dynamical eclipsing, and the expected emission from the\npolar orbits is tangential to the poles as in the case for\n\n[1] M. C.
