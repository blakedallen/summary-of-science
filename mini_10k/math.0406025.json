The two divisibility tests: going forward and backward\nWe are all familiar with divisibility tests for a few integers such as 3, 9, and 11.\nTo test whether a number is divisible by 3 or 9, we look at the sum of its digits,\nwhich is equivalent to taking the weighted sum of the digits, the weights all being\n1. For 11, the corresponding test is to examine the alternating sum and difference\nof digits, which means that the weights are 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121, . . . .\nThe problem of finding a sequence of weights for various divisors has been dealt\nwith in [Kh]; in this section, we briefly mention the various tests. First, some\nnotation. Any s \u2208 N with digits sj : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m is a polynomial of 10, i.e.\ns = sm sm\u22121 . . . s1 s0 =\n\nm\nX\n\n\u2190\n\nsj 10j =: s (k)\n\nj=0\n\n\u2190\n\nand similarly, one defines s (k), given s, k \u2208 N. The coefficients are the digits, i.e.\n0 \u2264 sj \u2264 9 for all j. To test whether s is divisible by d \u2208 N, let k \u2261 10 mod d, |k|\nminimal. Then\n\u2190\n\u2190\ns \u2261 s (10) \u2261 s (k) mod d\n\u2190\n\nand thus s is divisible by d if and only if s (k) is, i.e. the sequence of weights is\nsimply k0 , k1 , k2 , . . . , where\n\u2190\n\nk = k d \u2261 10\n\nmod d.\n\n(1)\n\u2190\n\n(In any base B > 1, this test would correspondingly use k d \u2261 B mod d.)\nThis proves the divisibility tests for 3, 9, and 11 (the last one holds because\n10 \u2261 \u22121 mod 11). It also helps test for powers of 2 and 5 (e.g. a number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75). However, if n > 20, then\nk \u2261 10 mod n, and the one with smallest |k| is 10 itself. So this does not simplify\nthe testing of divisibility.\nWe now mention the reverse test, also given in [Kh]. Suppose d \u2208 N is now\ncoprime to both 2 and 5. Then 10 has a multiplicative inverse modulo d, and we\nshall take k to be the representative of least absolute value.\nThus, 10k \u2261 1 mod d\nP\nj\ns\nand |k| is minimal. Then given s = sm sm\u22121 . . . s1 s0 = m\nj=0 j 10 , we have\n\u0012X\n\u0013\nm\nm\nm\nX\nX\n\u2212j\nm\nm\u2212j\nj\nsj k \u2261 10\nsj k\nsj 10 \u2261\nmod d.\n(2)\ns\u2261\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nSince gcd(d, 10) = 1, s is divisible by d if and only if\n\u2192\n\ns (k) =\n\nm\nX\nj=0\n\nsj km\u2212j\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n3\n\nis too. Thus, the sequence of weights (proceeding right to left this time) is simply\nk0 , k1 , k2 , . . . , where\n\u2192\n\nk = k d \u2261 10\u22121\n\nmod d.\n\n(3)\n\nObserve that we can also use equation (2) to compute s mod d even when s is not\n\u2192 \u2192\n\ndivisible by d. We simply reduce 10m mod d and multiply the result by s ( k d )\nmod d.\n\u2192\nFor example, k 29 = 3. Thus, to test 841 for divisibility by 29, we compute\n\u2212\u2192\n841(3) = 8 + (4 \u00d7 3) + (1 \u00d7 32 ) = 8 + 12 + 9 = 29, which is divisible by 29. Hence\n\u2190\n\n29|841. Note that this test is better than the standard one, because k 29 = 10 or\n\u221219. (As a later result on k-values for arithmetic progressions shows, we might, of\ncourse, get large values of k for large values of d.) Note that the tests for 3, 9, and\n11 work this way just as well.\n\n2. The proofs for a general Euclidean domain\n2.1. Preliminaries.\nDefinitions.\n(1) Let (E, \u03bd) be a (commutative) Euclidean domain with unity. Thus, E is\na commutative integral domain, with unity and a valuation \u03bd : E \\ {0} \u2192\nN0 := N \u222a {0}, such that:\n(a) \u2200s, 0 6= d in E, we can carry out the Euclidean algorithm. In other\nwords, there exist q, r \u2208 E so that s = dq + r, with r = 0 or \u03bd(r) < \u03bd(d).\n(b) If a, b \u2208 E are nonzero, then \u03bd(ab) \u2265 \u03bd(a).\n(By general theory, E is also a PID, and hence a UFD.)\n(2) Define E0 := E \u00d7 \u222a {0}, where E \u00d7 is the group of units in E. (Thus, E0 = E\niff E is a field.)\n(3) Given (s, d) as above, define q0 = s. Given qn , inductively define qn+1 and\nrn to be any choice of quotient and remainder, when one divides by d. In\nother words, qn = dqn+1 + rn for all n.\nWe say that the Euclidean algorithm terminates for (s, d), if there is a\nsequence of qn 's, that is eventually identically zero (equivalently by Lemma\n1 below, some qn = 0).\n(4) We also say that the strong Euclidean algorithm holds if given s \u2208 E and a\nnonzero nonunit d \u2208 E \\ E0 , for any choice of quotient q and remainder r\n(in the Euclidean algorithm), we have \u03bd(q) < \u03bd(s) (resp. \u03bd(r) < \u03bd(d)), if q\n(resp. r) is nonzero.\n\n\f4\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nFor example, the strong Euclidean algorithm holds for E = Z and F [X], F a field.\nThe latter is easy to see, since the degrees of q, r must be less than that of s, d\nrespectively; for the former, suppose s = dq + r. If |dq| \u2264 |s| then we are done; else\n|dq| > |s|. But then r 6= 0, so |q| = |s \u2212 r|/|d| \u2264 (|s| + |r|)/|d| < (|s|/|d|) + 1. But\nthis is at least (|s|/2) + 1 since d \u2208\n/ E0 , so |q| < (|s|/2) + 1. If |s| > 2 then we are\ndone; otherwise d > 2 = s, and we have 2 = d * 1 + (2 \u2212 d) = d * 0 + 2. In both cases,\n\u03bd(s) = 2 > \u03bd(q).\nWe now show two easy lemmas; the first shows what it means to satisfy one of\nthe defining axioms of a Euclidean domain, and the second explores properties of\nunits, related to the valuation.\nLemma 1. Given a commutative integral domain E with unit, that satisfies the\nEuclidean algorithm (as in (1)(a) above) for some \u03bd : E \u2192 N0 , the following are\nequivalent:\n(1) The Euclidean algorithm gives unique quotient and remainder, when applied\nto (de, d) for any e \u2208 E and any d 6= 0.\n(2) The Euclidean algorithm gives unique quotient and remainder, when applied\nto (0, d) for any d 6= 0.\n(3) \u03bd(ab) \u2265 \u03bd(a)\u2200a, b 6= 0.\nProof. Clearly, (1) implies (2). Given (2), suppose \u03bd(ab) < \u03bd(a) for some a, b. Then\nif we divide 0 by a, we have two solutions to the Euclidean algorithm, namely\n0 = 0 * a + 0 = (\u2212b) * a + (ab)\nwhich is a contradiction. Finally, given (3), suppose we have a solution to de =\nd*q +r. Thus r = d(e\u2212q), so that if e 6= q, then \u03bd(r) \u2265 \u03bd(d) > \u03bd(r), a contradiction.\nHence e = q and r = 0.\n\u0003\nLemma 2. The following are equivalent for 0 6= B \u2208 E:\n(1) B \u2208 E \u00d7 (i.e. B is a unit).\n(2) \u03bd(Be) = \u03bd(e) for all nonzero e \u2208 E.\n(3) \u03bd(B) = \u03bd(1).\n(4) \u03bd(B) \u2264 \u03bd(1).\n(5) The set {0 6= a \u2208 E : \u03bd(a) < \u03bd(B)} is empty.\nProof. Firstly, if B is a unit, then \u03bd(e) \u2264 \u03bd(Be) \u2264 \u03bd(BB \u22121 e) = \u03bd(e), so they are all\nequal and (1) \u21d2 (2). Setting e = 1, (2) \u21d2 (3) \u21d2 (4). Next, (4) implies (5) because\n\u03bd(a) = \u03bd(a * 1) \u2265 \u03bd(1) \u2265 \u03bd(B) for all nonzero a, so that the desired set of elements is\nempty. Finally, assume (5). Then 1 = qB + r by the Euclidean algorithm, and r = 0\nor \u03bd(r) < \u03bd(B). Given our assumption (5), we conclude that r = 0 and 1 = qB, so\nthat B is a unit.\n\u0003\nWe now adapt the results of the previous section to (E, \u03bd). Henceforth we assume\nthat E is not a field. Fix a base B \u2208\n/ E0 . From Lemma 2 above, this means that\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n5\n\nwe can talk of \"digits\" for numbers. Fix also a divisor d \u2208 E coprime to B (i.e.\ng.c.d.(d, B) = 1).\nLemma 3.\n(1) If the strong Euclidean algorithm holds, then it terminates for all (s, B).\nIn other words, every s \u2208 E can be written as s = sm sm\u22121 . . . s1 s0 =\nPm\nj\nj=0 sj B , where si = 0 or \u03bd(si ) < \u03bd(B) for all i.\n(2) If (B, d) = 1, then \u2203! B \u22121 mod d.\nProof. The first part follows from carrying out the Euclidean algorithm repeatedly,\ni.e. repeatedly dividing by B. Note that at each stage, the quotient qn+1 has a\nstrictly smaller \u03bd-value than the previous quotient qn , whence it must eventually be\nless than \u03bd(B). We then define qn+2 = 0 and rn+1 = qn+1 .\nThe second part holds in any PID: since B and d are coprime we can find \u03b10 , \u03b20 \u2208\nE such that \u03b10 B + \u03b20 d = 1. Thus \u03b10 B \u2261 1 mod d, and \u03b10 is an inverse modulo d.\nIf there are two such, namely B1\u22121 and B2\u22121 , then (B1\u22121 \u2212 B2\u22121 )B \u2261 1 \u2212 1 \u2261 0\nmod d, so it equals ld for some l \u2208 E. Multiplying by \u03b10 , and noting that \u03b10 B =\n1 \u2212 \u03b20 d, we get\n(B1\u22121 \u2212 B2\u22121 ) = [(B1\u22121 \u2212 B2\u22121 )\u03b20 + l\u03b10 ]d\nwhich means that d|LHS, and B \u22121 is unique modulo d, as claimed.\n\u0003\n\n2.2. The proof of the reverse test.\nWe again test whether or not s is divisible by d in E. Clearly, we have two different methods, as above. The first (or standard) method is as above, and we focus\non the second one now. For notation we fix B > 1, our base, and d, our divisor,\nthat is coprime to B. Given a dividend s \u2208 E, let s0 be the unit's digit and \u03b2 be\nthe \"rest\", i.e. s = \u03b2B + s0 , with s0 = 0 or \u03bd(s0 ) < \u03bd(B).\nTheorem 1. There is a unique k \u2208 E/dE, that satisfies the following condition for\nall s \u2208 E :\ns = \u03b2s0 \u2261 0 mod d iff \u03b2 + ks0 \u2261 0 mod d\nMoreover,\n\u2192\n\nk = kd := kd \u2261 B \u22121\n\nmod d\n\n(4)\n\nProof. Existence is easy: define kd \u2261 B \u22121 mod d. Now we see that \u03b2 + kd s0 \u2261\nkd (B\u03b2 + s0 ) \u2261 kd s mod d. Since B and d were coprime, hence so are kd and d, so\ns = B\u03b2 + s0 \u2261 0 mod d iff \u03b2 + kd s0 \u2261 0 mod d, as desired.\nFor uniqueness, suppose any such k exists. We then keep kd as above. Now take\nany multiple s of d, so that s0 = 1, i.e. s \u2261 1 mod B. Since d and B are coprime,\nsuch a multiple clearly exists (e.g. from the proof of Lemma 3 above, \u03b20 d \u2261 1\nmod B). Then by our condition, \u03b2 + ks0 = \u03b2 + k \u2261 0 mod d. But since s \u2261 0\n\n\f6\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nmod d, hence kd s \u2261 0 mod d, whence we get kd s = kd (B\u03b2 + 1) \u2261 \u03b2 + kd \u2261 0\nmod d.\nThus \u03b2 + kd \u2261 \u03b2 + k \u2261 0 mod d, whence k \u2261 kd mod d, as required.\n\u0003\nNotation : Henceforth, we only consider dividends of the form s = sm . . . s0 , where\nthe si 's are the digits of s, when written in base B. Let 0 < n1 < * * * < nl < m for\nsome l.

For instance, to check 142857142 for divisibility by 7, we compute:\n142 - 857 + 142 = 284 - 857 = -573 \u2261 \u221213 \u2261 1 mod 7, whence 7 \u2224 142857142. The\nreason this works is the corollary above (and the remarks following it), if we note\nthat 1000 \u2261 \u22121 mod 7, so that 106 \u2261 1 mod 7.\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n7\n\nWe now show that the k-values of terms in an arithmetic progression (more precisely, having the same \"unit's digit\"), themselves form an arithmetic progression.\nThis is useful to calculate k-values for general d, if we know the k-value of only the\nunit's digit of d. (For example, knowing k9 , we can easily calculate k19 , k29 , etc.).\nTheorem 2. Take a \u2208 E (a, B coprime), and m \u2208 E. Let d = Bm + a. Then\nkd = ka+mB \u2261 ka + ml\n\nmod d, where l =\n\n1\n(Bka \u2212 1)\na\n\n(5)\n\nProof. We compute: B(ka + ml) = Bka + Bml = (1+ al)+ Bml = 1+ l(a+ mB) \u2261 1\nmod (a + mB) \u2261 1 mod d. Hence by definition of kd , we are done.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 4. Let d|(B t \u2212 a) where a \u2208 E \u00d7 and t \u2208 N0 . Then kd \u2261 B t (aB)\u22121 mod d.\nProof. B(B t (aB)\u22121 ) = a\u22121 (B t ) = a\u22121 (B t \u2212 a) + 1 \u2261 1 mod d \u2261 Bkd mod d.\nHence we cancel B (modulo d) to get the result.\n\u0003\nThis (last) result tells us, in particular, the divisibility tests for 3, 9, and 11. We\nnow give two examples in the Euclidean domain E = F [X] (where F is a field.)\nExample 1: Let us work with B = X, d = X 2 + 1. We want to check whether or\nnot s = X 4 + X 2 is divisible by d. Clearly, s = 10100 in base X, and to apply our\ntest, we note that (\u2212X)d = \u2212X 2 \u2261 1 mod d. Hence k = \u2212X = \u221210. So we get\n\u03b1s (k) = 1 + (\u221210)2 = 101 and this is indeed divisible by 101 = d. Therefore, so is\nthe original s.\nExample 2: We now show how the Factor Theorem for polynomials is an example\nof the reverse test. We still work with B = X, and d = X \u2212 c for some c \u2208 F \u00d7 . We\nwant to check if a general element\ns = sm sm\u22121 . . . s1 s0 =\n\nm\nX\n\nsj X j\n\nj=0\n\nis divisible by d or not. From Lemma 4 above, kd \u2261 c\u22121 mod d. Thus to check\nwhether\nor not d|s is the same as checking whether or not (X \u2212 c) divides \u03b1s (kd ) =\nPm\n\u22121 )m\u2212j \u2208 F . Since this is a scalar, it should be zero, and multiplying by\ns\n(c\nj\nj=0\nm\nc should still give zero. Thus,\n(X \u2212 c)|s(X) iff\n\nm\nX\n\nsj cj = 0 iff s(c) = 0\n\nj=0\n\nand this is just the Factor Theorem for polynomials. Moreover, Theorem 2 above\nsays that the \"k-value\" function (taking dm = mX \u2212 c to k(dm )), is a linear function\nin m \u2208 F .\n\n\f8\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\n2.3. Testing for divisibility by general n \u2208 E.\nWe now check whether or not a given number s is divisible by n, where n \u2208 E\nneed not be coprime to B, the base in which both s and n are written. To do\nthis, we take n = dp\u03b11 1 p\u03b12 2 . . . p\u03b1h h (by unique factorization in the UFD E), where\nd is coprime to B, and p1 , p2 , . . . , ph are some or all of the primes that divide\nB (\u03b1i \u2208 N for i = 1, 2, . . . , h).\nDivisibility by d is tested by the method given above, and for each pi , we perform\nthe analogue (in base B) of the \"n-right-digits test\":\nIf \u03b2i is the highest power of pi dividing B, then to test for p\u03b1i i , we check whether\nor not the number formed by the \u2308\u03b1i /\u03b2i \u2309 rightmost digits of s (in that order and in\nbase B) is divisible by p\u03b1i i . (Here, \u2308x\u2309 is the least integer greater than or equal to\nx, e.g. if \u03b2i |\u03b1i , then \u2308\u03b1i /\u03b2i \u2309 = \u03b1i /\u03b2i .) This is because the place value of each of\n\u03b2 \u2308\u03b1 /\u03b2 \u2309\nthe other digits is \u2265 B \u2308\u03b1i /\u03b2i \u2309 , and this is already divisible by pi i i i , which is a\n\u03b1i\nmultiple of pi .\nFor example, take E = Z. In base 10, to check for divisibility by 125, we only\nneed to check the three rightmost digits - they have to be 000, 125, 250, ..., 750,\nor 875. As another example, consider B = 12. Since 12 = 3 \u00d7 22 , hence to check\ndivisibility by 8 = 23 , the \u23083/2\u2309 = \u23081.5\u2309 = 2 rightmost digits have to be checked.\n\nPart 2 : Recurring Decimal Representations\n3. Decimal representation of fractions - a few observations\nWe know that every rational number can be represented as a number having\na terminating or a recurring set of digits in its decimal representation. We observe certain interesting properties of the digits in the recurring portion, e.g. 71 =\n0.142857 142857 . . . , and upon multiplying 142857 by any number from 1 to 6, we\nget the same six digits in the same cyclic order (142857, 285714, 428571, 571428,\n714285, 857142). On multiplying it by 7, we get 999999, so that in the dec1\n=\nimal representation, it becomes 0.9999 * * * = 1. Another similar case is 17\n0.05882352 94117647 0588 . . . , and if 0588 . . . 7647 (including the zero) is multiplied by any number from 1 to 16, then the same sixteen digits are obtained in the\nsame cyclic order; if it is multiplied by 17 then the result, of course, is 9999 . . . 9999\n(sixteen 9's). This is further addressed in the comments following Lemma 10 below.\nWe also observe the following phenomenon, which we quote from [Kv]: We know\nthat 1/7 = 0.142857. If we square 142857, we get 20408122449. Take the first six\ndigits (from the right) and add them to the number formed by the rest (we take six\ndigits because 142857 has six digits). We then get 20408+122449 = 142857.\nSimilarly, if we take 1/27 = 0.037 and square 37 then we get 1369, and adding the\nrest to the three rightmost digits yields 1+369 = 370, again a multiple of the original\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n9\n\nnumber. We shall also show this phenomenon in general, in Lemma 10 below.\nWe observe another interesting property in both cases - and more generally, in the\ncase of every prime whose reciprocal has an even number of digits in its recurring\ndecimal portion. Namely, if the second half of numbers is kept below the first half,\nthen the sum of every pair of corresponding digits is 9 (e.g. in 142 857, 1+8 = 4+5\n= 2 + 7 = 9). We give further examples below, and explain this in Lemma 9 and\nTheorem 3 below.\nFirst of all, how do we get recurring decimals ? For an odd prime p 6= 5, we\nlook at the order b of 10 in (Z/pZ)\u00d7 . We have 10b \u2261 1 mod p. Thus p divides\n10b \u2212 1 = 999 . . . 9 (b nines). Let 10b \u2212 1 be denoted by 9b , and let 9pb = rp . Thus,\nwe have p1 = 1p (0.999 . . . ) = p1 (0.9b 9b . . . ) = 0.rp rp . . . . Then the number of digits\nin the recurring part of the reciprocal of p gives the number of terms (i.e. b) in the\nchain. Related facts are shown in Lemma 7 below.\nGiven p, we have various chains of recurring decimals - for instance, we have the\n(unique) chain 142857 = 571428 etc. for 1/7. However, for some numbers (e.g. 13),\nwe might have more than one chain. Let cp be the number of distinct chains. Then\nbp cp = p \u2212 1.\nNow consider the situation in base B (for any B > 1). In what follows, the\nphrase \"decimal expansion\" also refers to the case of a general base B. In general,\nfor composite d, the recurring parts of t/d might have recurring chains of different\nlengths as well (e.g. for d = 21, in base 10, the chains for 7/21 and 14/21 have length\n1 each, and are different from the 6-digit chains for the other residues). However, if\nwe denote the different lengths of all possible chains by bi , and the number of chains\nof a given length (= bi ) by ci (for i = 1, 2, . . . ), then we have\nX\nFor any d (d \u2208 N, d coprime to B),\nbi ci = d\n(6)\ni\n\nWe also remark that the number of chains cp is also known as the residual index,\nand it clearly equals [(Z/pZ)\u00d7 : hBi].\nNote that in base 10, we take d/d = 1 = 0.999 * * * = 0.9\u0304, and this makes the above\nsum one more than the d \u2212 1, that we obtained above, in the case when d was a\nprime. Similarly for base B.\nOf course, we can find many composite numbers d which have only one value of\nb (= bd , say), e.g. b91 = 6. This happens, for instance, when d is the product of two\nor more primes, all distinct, and all having the same b-value. This is addressed in\nProposition 1 below.\nProof of Equation (6). Look at {t/d : 1 \u2264 t \u2264 d}, and look at their \"dec\"imal\nrepresentations. Clearly, there are no repetitions among the various decimals, for the\nnumbers in the above set are all distinct (modulo d). Further, the numbers in the set\nwhose recurring chains coincide with the chain t/d = 0.a1 . . . ab are precisely t/d, (Bt\n\n\f10\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nmod d)/d, (B 2 t mod d)/d, . . . , (B b\u22121 t mod d)/d. Hence, given any chain, every\ncyclic permutation of it corresponds to t/d for some d.\nThis gives a bijection between all cyclic permutations of a fixed chain (bi of them),\nand bi of the residue classes modulo d. Hence we get equation (6) above, because\nthere are d residue classes modulo d (where we also include 1 = d/d = 0.9 etc.). \u0003\n\n4. Properties of recurring decimals - proofs for a Euclidean domain\nWe now work on fractions and recurring \"dec\"imals in base B, in a Euclidean\ndomain (E, \u03bd). Though we cannot talk about convergence here, we can still talk\nabout repeating decimals representing a fraction, and such things.\nObserve that if 0 6= d is not a P\nunit, then \u03bd(1) < \u03bd(d), so 1/d should have an\nexpansion of the form 0.a1 a2 * * * = i ai B \u2212i \u2208 k(E), the quotient field of E. (Actually, we work in E[[B \u22121 ]] = E[[X]]/(BX \u2212 1).) We now find out what the ai 's are.\nRemarks :\n(1) We do not worry about convergence issues here, and only associate to a given\nfraction, a sequence ai of numbers, without worrying whether these numbers\nare actually digits or not (i.e. whether \u03bd(ai ) \u2265 or < \u03bd(B)). Note that if\nE = Z, then all sequences are actually decimal expansions that converge etc.\n(2) If d 6= 0 and d \u2224 a in E, then a/d = 0.a1 a2 . . . iff \u03bd(a) < \u03bd(d). In other words,\nthere exists a representation of a/d as 0.a1 a2 . . . iff the quotient (when we\ndivide a by d in E) is zero, iff a = 0 * d + r = r satisfies the Euclidean\nalgorithm, namely, that \u03bd(a) = \u03bd(r) < \u03bd(d).\nLemma 5. Suppose 0 6= d is not a unit, and we define\nai = \u230aB i /d\u230b \u2212 B\u230aB i\u22121 /d\u230b.\n\n1\nd\n\n= 0.a1 a2 . . . . Then\n\nHere, by \u230aa/b\u230b, we mean the quotient when we divide a by b.\nWarning : We need to choose and fix the quotients \u230aB i /d\u230b, since these are not, in\ngeneral, unique ! Moreover, convergence cannot be discussed, and the ai 's need not\nbe digits (i.e. we do not know if we have \u03bd(ai ) < \u03bd(B) or not).\nProof. Suppose we write 1/d = 0.a1 a2 . . . . Clearly, the quotient (i.e. the number to\nthe left of the decimal point) is zero because of the Euclidean algorithm (and since\n\u03bd(1) < \u03bd(d)). Next, a1 is clearly of the desired form, because of the same reason.\nWe now show that the ai 's are as claimed, by induction on i. The base case was\ndone above. To show the claim for ai , multiply the equation above by B i . Thus,\nB i /d = a1 a2 . . . ai .ai+1 ai+2 . . . , so taking the quotient of both sides yields\ni\n\n\u230aB /d\u230b = a1 a2 . . . ai =\n\ni\nX\nj=1\n\nB i\u2212j aj\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n11\n\nThis is because B i = d(a1 . . . ai ) + d(0.ai+1 . . . an a1 . . . ai ) = dq + r, say (where\nr = d(0.ai+1 . . . an a1 . . . ai ) \u2208 E). By the above assumption (since (B, d) = 1), we\nget that \u03bd(r) < \u03bd(d), so q and r are clearly the quotient and remainder, as desired.\nAssume by induction that we know the results for a1 , . . . , ai\u22121 . Then\nai = \u230aB i /d\u230b \u2212\n\ni\u22121\nX\n\nB i\u2212j (\u230aB j /d\u230b \u2212 B\u230aB j\u22121 /d\u230b)\n\nj=1\n\nand the latter is a telescoping sum, so we get\nai = \u230aB i /d\u230b \u2212 B\u230aB i\u22121 /d\u230b + B i \u230aB 0 /d\u230b\nBut the last term is zero, because \u03bd(B 0 ) < \u03bd(d). Hence we are done.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 6. The recurring decimal 0.a1 . . . an denotes the fraction a1 . . . an /(B n \u22121).\nIf a1 . . . an = B n \u2212 1, then the decimal equals 1.\nProof. Suppose e = 0.a1 . . . an . Then B n e = a1 . . . an .a1 . . . an . Subtracting from\nthis the definition of e, we are done. If, moreover, a1 . . . an = B n \u2212 1, then (B n \u2212\n1)(e \u2212 1) = 0. Since B is not a unit, B n 6= 1; since E is an integral domain, we\nconclude that e = 1.\n\u0003\nNext, to talk about periodicity of any and every a/d (for fixed d coprime to B)\nin such a decimal expansion, we need the following\nStanding Assumption : B has finite order in (E/dE)\u00d7 . (In particular, d \u2208\n/ E \u00d7 .)\nDenote this order by e. Thus e = od (B) = od (B \u22121 mod d) = od (kd ). We now get\n\u0001\nBe \u2212 1 1\n1\nBe \u2212 1\n1\n=\n+\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\n0.r\nr\n.\n.\n.\n,\nwhere\nr\n=\nd d\nd\nd\nd\nB e B 2e\nd\nand this is how we get recurring decimal expansions. Moreover, from the proof of\nLemma 5 above, rd = (B e \u2212 1)/d = \u230aB e /d\u230b (because \u03bd(1) < \u03bd(d)) = a1 . . . ae , and\nhence rd has e digits. Thus, the correct way to look at this, in a Euclidean domain,\nis to look at the order of B in (E/dE)\u00d7 , instead of the recurring decimal expansion\nor the number of digits therein.\nLemma 7. If t is coprime to d, and B has finite order e in (E/dE)\u00d7 , then the\nsequence of ai 's associated to t/d is recurring with period e.\n\u2032\n\nProof. The length of the sequence is the smallest e\u2032 \u2208 N such that tB e \u2261 t mod d.\nSince t is coprime to d, we get e\u2032 = e by definition.\n\u0003\nWe now turn to repeating decimals with even period. We have\nLemma 8. B has (finite, and) even period, modulo a prime p \u2224 2B, iff p|(B l + 1)\nfor some l \u2208 N.\n\n\f12\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nProof. Suppose p|(B l + 1) for some positive l; we assume, moreover, that l is the\nleast such. Thus p|(B 2l \u2212 1), whence the order op (B) is finite and divides 2l. Since\np \u2224 2, hence p \u2224 B l \u2212 1, whence op (B) \u2224 l. Thus op (B) = 2m for some m|l.\nConversely, if op (B) = 2m, then p|(B m + 1)(B m \u2212 1). By definition of order,\np \u2224 (B m \u2212 1), whence p|(B m + 1), and we are done. (Note, moreover, that continuing\nthe above proof of the first part, we find that l = m by choice of l.)\n\u0003\n\nLemma 9. Suppose d|(B l + 1) for some l \u2208 N. Then for all a coprime to d, the\nchains starting from the ith and the (l + i)th \"digits\" in the recurring part of a/d,\nadd up to a recurring chain that represents 1 or 0.\nProof. Since B l \u2261 \u22121 mod d, hence the chain corresponding to adding up the fractions (aB i mod d)/d and (aB l+i mod d)/d, yields the fraction ((aB i + a(\u22121)B i )\nmod d)/d = d/d = 1, as claimed.\n\u0003\nExamples:\n(1) Suppose E = Z and B = 10, so that \u03bd(B) > \u03bd(B\u22121). Then 1/7 = 0.142 857,\nwhich satisfies the above assumptions, since the chains add up to 0.999999 =\n0.9 = 1.\nSimilarly, 1/11 = 0.09. Here's another way to write this. Observe that\n9 = 10 * 0 + 9 = 10 * 1 + (\u22121), with \u03bd(\u22121) = | \u2212 1| < \u03bd(10). Hence we can\nalso write 1/11 = 0.1(\u22121), and then 1 + (\u22121) = 0. This corresponds to the\nrecurring chain 1.0 for 1.\n(2) As another example, consider B = F [X], with char F 6= 2. Suppose B = X\nand d = X 2 + 1 (so that \u03bd(B) = \u03bd(B \u2212 1)). Clearly, B has order 4 modulo\nd, since d|(X 4 \u2212 1). So 1/d should have four digits. But we also know what\nthese are : rd = (B e \u2212 1)/d = (X 4 \u2212 1)/(X 2 + 1) = X 2 \u2212 1 = 010(\u22121) in\nbase B = X. Thus 1/d = 0.010(\u22121) and once again, every pair of alternate\ndigits adds up to zero.\nWe thus see that the case E = Z and 1 = 0.9 is somewhat of an \"exception\" ! This\nis made more precise now.\nTheorem 3. Given a Euclidean domain (E, \u03bd) that is not a field, the following are\nequivalent:\n(1) \u03bd(B) = \u03bd(B \u2212 1) \u2200B \u2208\n/ E0 .\n(2) \u03bd(B) = \u03bd(B \u2212 c) \u2200B \u2208\n/ E0 , c \u2208 E0 .\n(3) The Euclidean algorithm yields a unique quotient and remainder when we\ndivide any B n \u2212 c by B, for any n \u2208 N, B \u2208\n/ E0 , c \u2208 E0 .\n(4) There is no B \u2208\n/ E0 , so that 1 can be expressed (in base B) as a recurring\ndecimal 0.a1 . . . an for some n \u2208 N, with \u03bd(ai ) < \u03bd(B) or ai = 0.\nProof. We prove a series of cyclic implications.\n(1) \u21d2 (2):\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n13\n\nThis is clear for c = 0, and for c \u2208 E \u00d7 , we have (assuming (1) and using part (2) of\nLemma 2)\n\u03bd(B \u2212 c) = \u03bd(c\u22121 (B \u2212 c)) = \u03bd(c\u22121 B \u2212 1) = \u03bd(c\u22121 B) = \u03bd(B)\n(2) \u21d2 (3):\nSuppose B n \u2212 c = qB + d. Then B|(c + d), whence (c + d) is not a unit. If d 6= \u2212c\nthen c + d is a nonzero nonunit (whence d 6= 0). Hence \u03bd(c + d) = \u03bd(d) by (2).\nMoreover, B|(c + d), so \u03bd(B) \u2264 \u03bd(c + d) = \u03bd(d) < \u03bd(B), the last inequality a consequence of the Euclidean algorithm. This gives a contradiction, whence d = \u2212c and\nhence q = B n\u22121 , as desired.\n(3) \u21d2 (4):\nSuppose we can write 1 as a recurring \"decimal\". Then by Lemma 6, B n \u2212 1 =\na1 . . . an = an +B *a1 . . . an\u22121 . Assuming (3), one notes that an = \u22121, since \u22121 \u2208 E0 .\nThus a1 . . . an\u22121 = B n\u22121 . Once again, by (3) we get that an\u22121 = 0. Proceeding\ninductively, we get that ai = 0 \u22001 < i < n, and finally, we are left with a1 = B, a\ncontradiction to \u03bd(a1 ) < \u03bd(B). Hence 1 cannot be written in recurring form.\n(4) \u21d2 (1):\nWe prove the contrapositive. Suppose we have a B \u2208\n/ E0 so that \u03bd(B) 6= \u03bd(B \u2212 1).\nThere are two cases. If \u03bd(B) > \u03bd(B \u2212 1), then (using Lemma 6) we have the\nexpansion 1 = 0.(B \u2212 1) in base B. On the other hand, if \u03bd(B) < \u03bd(B \u2212 1), then\n\u0003\nthe expansion e = 0.B(\u2212B) in base (B \u2212 1), again equals 1 (by Lemma 6).\n\nLemma 10. Suppose B e \u2212 1 = d * rd , where rd is the recurring part. Fix k, l \u2208 N\nand consider krd . Then the number formed by the first le \"digits\" (or ai 's), added\nto the number formed by the rest, yields a number that is divisible by rd .\nProof. The number in question is obtained as follows: suppose the \"rest of the digits\"\nform a number s\u2032 . (For instance, if E = Z, then we could write s\u2032 = \u230akrd /B le \u230b,\nwhere this denotes the greatest integer in the quotient.) Then the total number\nobtained is\ns\u2032 + (krd \u2212 B le s\u2032 ) = krd \u2212 (B le \u2212 1)s\u2032\nand this is divisible by rd , the quotient being k \u2212 ds\u2032 (1 + B e + * * * + B le\u2212e ).\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now show some of the facts from the previous sections. First of all, observe\nthat if t/d = 0.a1 . . . ai . . . , then 0.ai+1 ai+2 . . . comes from the expansion of B i t/d,\nor from (B i t mod d)/d = a/d, say. Thus if rd = (B e \u2212 1)/d, then the recurring part\nof a/d would correspond to ard . This explains why recurring decimal expansions\nkeep getting permuted cyclically, upon being multiplied by various numbers.\nNext, we define Dd , for any d satisfying the above assumption, to be the order e\nof B in (E/dE)\u00d7 , or equivalently, the \"number of terms\" of the sequence (ai ), in rd\n\n\f14\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nabove.\nQ\nSuppose d = ni=1 p\u03b1i i as above, where pi are primes in E (which is a unique\nfactorization domain). If d\u2032 |d, then\n0 \u2192 dE \u2192 d\u2032 E (\u0592\u2192 E)\nand hence\nE/dE \u2192 E/d\u2032 E \u2192 0\n(The kernel is, of course, d\u2032 E/dE, so we get the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 d\u2032 E/dE \u2192 E/dE \u2192 E/d\u2032 E \u2192 0\nfor every choice of d\u2032 .) In particular, B has finite order in every (E/d\u2032 E)\u00d7 (because\nif B e \u2261 1 mod d, then B e \u2261 1 mod d\u2032 ); in particular, in (E/pi E)\u00d7 as well. Thus\nwe can talk of Dpi as well. However, this does not guarantee that the standing\nassumption holds for pni for all n. So we need to make a stronger assumption.\nHowever, let us remark that once B has finite order in (E/dE)\u00d7 , every t/d has\na recurring decimal expansion. For, we write t/d = t\u2032 /d\u2032 in lowest terms, and then\nfrom the above remarks, B has finite order in (E/d\u2032 E)\u00d7 , and we are done.\nProposition 1. Suppose d = p1 . . . ph for distinct primes pi , all coprime to B. Let\nbi (\u2208 N) denote the order of B in (E/pi E)\u00d7 .\n(1) Then B has finite order in (E/dE)\u00d7 , and this order, denoted by bd , say, is\nthe l.c.m. of the bi 's.\n(2) If bi = bd \u2200i, then B has order bd in (E/d\u2032 E)\u00d7 , for every nonunit d\u2032 |d.\nProof.\n(1) Clearly, B lcm \u2212 1 \u2261 0 mod pi \u2200i, where lcm denotes the l.c.m.\nof the bi 's.\nQ\nSince the pi 's are mutually coprime, and E is a UFD, hence i pi also divides\nB lcm \u2212 1. Thus B has finite order in (E/dE)\u00d7 , and moreover, this order has\nto divide the l.c.m. But the l.c.m. has to divide the order as well, so we are\ndone.\n(2) Suppose bi = bd \u2200i. Now, if d \u2224 a, then a/d is of the form r/s, where r and\ns are coprime, and s is a product of some of the pi 's. Clearly, r/s and 1/s\nhave the same number of recurring digits, because (r, s) = 1. But s 6= 1 is a\nproduct of some pi 's, and each 1/pi has bd recurring digits. Hence so does\n1/s, and so does r/s = a/d.\n\u0003\n5. The period of recurrence of a fraction in a Euclidean domain\nWe have the following\nLemma 11. If B has finite order e modulo p, then the following are equivalent:\n(1) B has finite order modulo pn for any n.\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n15\n\n(2) There exists a unique prime integer p\u2032 \u2208 Z (which is prime in Z, but may\nnot be prime in E), so that p|p\u2032 .\n(3) There exists n \u2208 Z so that p|n.\nRemark: By Z we mean the image of Z in E, for we do not know if E has characteristic zero or not.\nProof. Suppose B has order e modulo p. Thus B e = 1+\u03b1p for some \u03b1 \u2208 E. Suppose\n\u03b1 = pf \u03b2, where p \u2224 \u03b2. Now, B en \u2261 1+n\u03b1p mod pf +2 (ignoring higher order terms).\nThus, B has finite order modulo pf +2 iff there is some n such that pf +2 |n\u03b1p. But\nfrom our assumptions on f , this means p|n. Thus (1) \u21d2 (3).\nConversely, assume that p|n. Now observe that if s \u2261 1 mod pm for any s \u2208\nE, m \u2208 N, then s = 1 + \u03b2pm for some \u03b2 \u2208 E, whence\nsn = (1 + \u03b2pm )n \u2261 1 + \u03b2npm\n\nmod p2m \u2261 1 + \u03b2npm\n\nmod pm+1 \u2261 1 mod pm+1\n\nsince p|n and m \u2208 N. In particular, since B e \u2261 1 mod pf +1 \u2261 1 mod p, hence\nm\u22121\n\u2261 1 mod pm for all m \u2208 N. Hence (3) \u21d2 (1).\nB en\nThat (2) and (3) are equivalent is easy : in one direction, choose n = p\u2032 . In\nthe other direction, decompose n into prime factors (as integers), and note that\nin E, p must divide some integer prime factor of n. If p divided two such, then\nit would divide any integer linear combination of these prime numbers, whence p\nwould divide 1, and hence be a unit. This is not possible.\n\u0003\nThus, we now make the following\nStanding Assumptions :\n(1) (E, \u03bd) is a Euclidean domain, not a field. Fix B \u2208\n/ E0 .\n(2) For each prime p \u2208 E, p \u2224 B, (a) B has finite order modulo p, and (b) there\nexists a unique prime integer p\u2032 \u2208 Z so that p|p\u2032 (and p\u2032 6= 0) in E.\nAs an easy consequence, we have\nLemma 12. E (or its quotient field) has characteristic 0.\nProof. E is not a field, so there exists a nonzero nonunit in E. By unique factorization, there exists a nonzero prime p \u2208 E, so by assumption there exists a nonzero\nprime integer p\u2032 that is a multiple of p. Now, p\u2032 \u2208\n/ E0 since p \u2208\n/ E0 . This would give\na contradiction if E had positive characteristic, so we are done.\n\u0003\nLemma 13. If (B, d) = 1, then B has finite order modulo d. Further, there is a\nunique n \u2208 N such that for each m \u2208 Z, d|m in E iff n|m in Z.\nProof. We argue by induction on the number of distinct prime factors of d (ignoring\nmultiplicities). If this number is 1, then d is a prime power, and we are done by the\nprevious lemma.\nSuppose we now have a general d = pr d\u2032 for some p prime in E, coprime to d\u2032 ,\nand suppose we know the result for d\u2032 . Then B f = 1 + \u03b1d\u2032 for some \u03b1, f . If B e \u2261 1\n\n\f16\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nmod pr , then B ef \u2261 1 modulo both d\u2032 and pr , which are coprime. Hence by unique\nfactorization, B ef Q\n\u2261 1 mod d, and we are done. Q\nFinally, if d = i p\u03b1i i , and pi |p\u2032i \u2208 Z, then d| i (p\u2032i )\u03b1i \u2208 Z. Thus the set S of\nintegers divisible by d, properly contains the element 0 (since E has characteristic\nzero, from above). Moreover, S is clearly an ideal in Z, hence is principal and\ngenerated by some n \u2208 N. This is the required n (and d|n), and we are done.\n\u0003\nWe now calculate Dd = the number of digits in the recurring decimal part of xd ,\nwhere d is coprime to both x and to B, and d = p\u03b11 1 p\u03b12 2 . . . p\u03b1h h (the pi 's here are\ndistinct primes coprime to B, and \u03b1i Q\n\u2208 N).\nFor the rest of this section, fix d = i p\u03b1i i coprime to B, and fix p, a prime factor\nof d. Define qi (p) = qi = Dpi = order of B in (E/pi E)\u00d7 , and define f to be the\nhighest power of p that divides the prime integer p\u2032 (as in the Standing Assumptions\nabove). Also let \u03bdp (m) be the largest power of p that divides m in the UFD E.\nWe first prove the following generalization of [Ri, P.1.2 (iv), pp.11] (special cases\nof the result in [Ri] were known to Euler):\nm\n\nm\n\n\u2212y\nProposition 2. Given x 6= y in E, define a(m) = x x\u2212y\nfor m \u2265 0. Now assume\nthat p|(x\u2212y) and p \u2224 y. Then p|a(m) \u21d4 p\u2032 |m. If, moreover, \u03bdp (x\u2212y) > \u230af /(p\u2032 \u22121)\u230b \u2208\nN0 , then for all m \u2208 N, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012 m\nx \u2212 ym\n= \u03bdp (m)\n\u03bdp (a(m)) = \u03bdp\nx\u2212y\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nIn particular, (xp \u2212 y p )/(x \u2212 y) is divisible by pf but not by pf +1 .\nProof. Firstly, it is easy to check that (x\u2212y)|(a(m)\u2212my m\u22121 ) for all m. Now suppose\np|(x \u2212 y). Then a(m) \u2261 my m\u22121 mod (x \u2212 y), whence the same holds modulo p.\nSince p, y are coprime, we conclude that p|a(m) \u21d4 p|m \u21d4 p\u2032 |m, by Lemma 13\nabove.\nNow suppose that \u03bdp (x \u2212 y) > f /(p\u2032 \u2212 1). Setting x \u2212 y = t, we get that\nPp\u2032 p\u2032 \u0001 p\u2032 \u2212i i\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\na(p\u2032 ) = ((y + t)p \u2212 y p )/t =\nt . Over here, every term except\ni=1 i y\nthe first and last one, is divisible by p\u2032 * p, since there is a binomial coefficient and\n\u2032\n\u2032\na power of t in each term. Thus, modulo pf +1 , we have a(p\u2032 ) \u2261 p\u2032 y p \u22121 + tp \u22121 .\n\u2032\nThe last term is divisible by pn(p \u22121) , where n = \u03bdp (x \u2212 y) > f /(p\u2032 \u2212 1); hence it\nis divisible by pf +1 . The first term is only divisible by pf , since p, y are coprime.\nThus the last line of the result is proved.\nTo prove the rest of the result, suppose m = up\u2032 s , where p\u2032 \u2224 u. Now define\n\u2032 i\n\u2032 i\nXi = x(p ) , Yi = y (p ) , and note that\n\u2032\n\u2032\ns\u22121\ns\u22121\nXs u \u2212 Ys u Y Xi+1 \u2212 Yi+1\nXs u \u2212 Ys u Y Xi p \u2212 Yi p\nxm \u2212 y m\n=\n*\n=\n*\nx\u2212y\nXs \u2212 Ys\nXi \u2212 Yi\nXs \u2212 Ys\nXi \u2212 Yi\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n17\n\nwhere the product on the right telescopes. Since (x\u2212y)|(Xi \u2212Yi ), hence \u03bdp (Xi \u2212Yi ) >\nf /(p\u2032 \u2212 1) for all i. Hence by the previous paragraph, each term in the product is\nexactly divisible by pf ; moreover, the remaining term is not divisible by p by the\nm \u2212y m\nfirst part of this result, since p \u2224 u. Hence \u03bdp ( x x\u2212y\n) = f s = \u03bdp (m).\n\u0003\nTheorem 4. For all n \u2208 N, qn+1 = qn or p\u2032 qn . Now let g be the least natural\nnumber so that (a) g > f /(p\u2032 \u2212 1), and (b) qg+1 = p\u2032 qg . Then for all n \u2265 0, we have\nqg+n = (p\u2032 )\u2308n/f \u2309 qg\nProof. First, the general case. We assume qn+1 6= qn . Now, B qn+1 \u2261 1 mod pn+1 \u2261\n1 mod pn , whence qn |qn+1 . So let qn+1 = mqn . We now use the first part of\nProposition 2, setting x = B qn and y = 1. Thus, the order of B qn in (E/pn+1 E)\u00d7\nis larger than 1 and divides the prime integer p\u2032 , whence it is p\u2032 .\nNext, let g be as above, and let n \u2208 N. By the previous paragraph, qg+n = (p\u2032 )s qg\nfor some s. We now apply the second part of Proposition 2, this time setting\nx = B qg , y = 1. Thus\n\u0012 (p\u2032 )s\n\u2032 s\u0013\n\u2212 y (p )\nx\n= \u03bdp ((p\u2032 )s ) = f s\n\u03bdp\nx\u2212y\nand the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemarks:\n(1) To conclude this discussion, if d = p\u03b11 1 p\u03b12 2 . . . p\u03b1h h is coprime to B, then to\nfind Dd , we find Qi = q\u03b1i (pi ) (i = 1, 2, . . . , h). Since p1 , p2 , . . . , ph all divide\nB Dd \u2212 1, hence Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Qh all divide Dd . Moreover, Dd is the least such\npositive number. Hence\nDd = lcm(Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Qh )\n\n(7)\n\np\u2032\n\n(2) For E = Z, note that\n= p is itself prime, so that f = 1, and all our\nother standing assumptions are satisfied, for any B > 1. Moreover, od (B)\nnow does denote the number of digits in the recurring part of the decimal expansion (in base B) of 1/d, so we can compute this using the above theorem.\n(3) In the decimal system (B = 10), note that for the first few primes p > 5, we\nhave g = 1, though g3 = 2 for p = 3. Thus, D3 = D9 = 1, D27 = 3, D81 = 9,\nand so on, while D7 = 6, D49 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42 etc.\nOne can ask if this phenomenon actually holds for all primes p > 5. In\nother words, are the orders of 10 in (Z/pZ)\u00d7 and (Z/p2 Z)\u00d7 unequal for all\nprimes p > 5 ?\nThe answer is no. The prime p = 487 satisfies q1 = q2 = p \u2212 1 = 486 (and\nq3 = p(p \u2212 1)).\nHowever, is there a base B for which this property does hold (for E = Z) ?\n\n\f18\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\n6. Concluding remarks and questions\nWe conclude this part with a few questions: all the properties asked below are\nknown to hold or not to hold for E = Z or F [X], and we want to ask whether they\nhold in general, or if we can characterise all Euclidean domains with that property.\n(1) Is there always a \"good\" quotient and remainder ? In other words, can we\nalways find a valuation \u03bd, so that the following holds ?\nGiven s, 0 6= d \u2208 E, we can find q, r by the Euclidean algorithm, such\nthat s = dq + r, r = 0 or \u03bd(r) < \u03bd(d), and with the additional property that\n\u03bd(dq) \u2264 \u03bd(s).\nFor example, in E = Z, suppose s = \u221211, d = 3. Then s = (\u22124)d + 1 =\n(\u22123)d + (\u22122), and we take the good (q, r) to be (\u22123, \u22122).\n(2) Does there exist a (sub)multiplicative valuation ? Namely, a valuation \u03bd\nsatisfying : if \u03bd(a) \u2264 \u03bd(b) and \u03bd(c) \u2264 \u03bd(d), then \u03bd(ac) \u2264 \u03bd(bd).\n(3) Does there always exist a valuation satisfying the triangle inequality ?\n(4) Is there a characterization of all Euclidean domains in which every prime\ndivides a prime integer (i.e. p|p\u2032 in E, where p\u2032 is prime in Z, and nonzero\nin E) ?\nFor example, it is true in E = Z and in Z[i] (because a + bi divides\na2 + b2 \u2208 Z, so every prime divides an integer, and by Lemma 11 above, we\nare done). But this property does not hold in E = F [X] (F a field), since the\npolynomial X \u22121 is prime, but does not divide any integer (or field element).\nWe have a partial answer for this last question (note that we already saw above\nthat E has to have characteristic zero here).\nProposition 3. Suppose (E, \u03bd) is a Euclidean domain but not a field. If the strong\nEuclidean algorithm holds, and every prime p \u2208 E divides a prime integer p\u2032 \u2208 Z \u2282\nE, then E is finitely generated as an R-module over the subring R = Z[E \u00d7 ].\nProof. We produce a surjection : R[X] \u2192 E, with a monic polynomial in the kernel.\nNote that E0 = E \u00d7 \u222a{0} \u2282 R. We first claim that there is a (set-theoretic) surjection\n: E0 [X] \u0589 E.\nSince E is not a field, there exist nonzero nonunits. Pick one with the least\nvaluation, say B \u2208 E, such that \u03bd(u) < \u03bd(B) \u2264 \u03bd(y) for all nonzero nonunits y and\nall units u in E. By Lemma 3, the evaluation map : X 7\u2192 B is a surjection from\nE0 [X] onto E. Hence it extends to an R-linear map : R[X] \u0589 E.\nNext, by factoring B into a product of primes, we can find n \u2208 Z such that B|n.\nThus, Bl = n for some l \u2208 E. Write l = p(B) for some polynomial p in E0 [X]; we\nthus get that n = Bl = Bp(B) = cm B m+1 + * * * + c0 B for some ci \u2208 E0 , and cm 6= 0.\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n19\n\nThus cm is a unit, and we get that\nq(B) = cm B m+1 + * * * + c0 B \u2212 n = 0.\nThis means that c\u22121\nm q(X) is in the kernel of the surjection R[X] \u2192 E (which is\n2\nm\nthe evaluation map at B). Since c\u22121\nm q(X) is monic, hence 1, B, B , . . . , B generate\nE over R, and we are done.\n\u0003\nRemarks: The result implies that E is not a polynomial ring F [X]. Moreover,\nif E \u00d7 is finite, then E is a finitely generated abelian group. Also, the proof only\nassumes that the Euclidean algorithm terminates for all (s, B), where B is any fixed\nelement not in E0 , of least \u03bd-value.\nSimilar questions have been answered; we give a couple of examples. Given n \u2208 N,\nwe define a Euclidean domain to be of type n if, for every s, d 6= 0 (as in the definition\nof a Euclidean domain E), such that d \u2224 s, there exist exactly n distinct pairs (qi , ri )\nsatisfying the Euclidean algorithm property s = qi d + ri \u22001 \u2264 i \u2264 n. We then have\nthe following two results.\nTheorem 5 ([Ga]). The only Euclidean domain of type 2 is E = Z.\nTheorem 6 ([Rh, Jo]). The only Euclidean domains of type 1 are E = F or F [X],\nwhere F is a field and X is transcendental over F . (In particular, E \u00d7 = F \u00d7 .)\nSimilar results were also shown by Jacobson and Picavet, in [Ja] and [Pi] respectively.\nPart 3 : Quantitative aspects (written with P. Moree)\nAccording to [Kv], many people, including Johann Bernoulli III, C.-F. Gauss,\nA.H. Beiler, S. Yates, and others, have worked on the problem of repeating decimals. Repeating decimals were quite a popular topic of study in the 19th century\n(cf. Zentralblatt). We also find the following remarks:\nAll prime numbers coprime to 10 can be divided into three groups:\n(1) p such that Dp = p \u2212 1 (the full-period primes).\n(2) p such that Dp < p \u2212 1 is odd (the odd-period primes).\n(3) p such that Dp < p \u2212 1 is even (the non-full-period primes).\nIt was found that the proportion of primes in these three groups had a relatively stable asymptotic ratio of around 9:8:7, by numerical computations up to\np = 1370471. We will now explain that it is possible to be more precise than this.\nConcerning the primes in (1). The full-period primes have been well studied, starting with C.-F. Gauss in his 1801 masterpiece Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\nThough no written source for this seems to be available, folklore has it that Gauss\nconjectured that there are infinitely many full-period primes.\n\n\f20\n\nAPOORVA KHARE\n\nIn September 1927, Emil Artin made a conjecture which implies that the proportion of primes, modulo which 10 is a primitive root (i.e. primes of type (1)\nin the classification above), should equal a number we now call Artin's constant\nA = 0.3739558136192 . . . . More precisely, we have\n\u0013\nY\u0012\n1\n,\nA=\n1\u2212\np(p \u2212 1)\np\nwhere the product is over all primes. Clearly, this is close to 9/24 = 3/8 = 0.375,\nthe ratio mentioned above. Assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH)\nit was proved by Hooley [Ho] that the full-period primes have proportion A.\nArtin's original conjecture gave a prediction for the density of primes p such that\na prescribed integer g is a primitive root modulo p. Following numerical calculations\nby Derrick H. Lehmer and Emma Lehmer in 1957, Artin corrected his conjecture\nfor certain g (see [St]), and his corrected conjecture, also attributed to Heilbronn,\nwas proved by Hooley in the paper cited above, on assuming GRH. Further generalisations of Artin's primitive root conjecture are discussed, e.g. in the survey paper\n[Mo3].\nIn [He], Heath-Brown, improving on earlier work by Gupta and Ram Murty [GR],\nproved a result which implies, unconditionally, that there exist at most two primes\n(p > 0) - and three squarefree integers k > 1 - for which there are only finitely many\nfull-period primes (i.e. for which the qualitative version of Artin's primitive root\nconjecture fails).\nConcerning the primes in (2). Since for an odd prime p, the number p \u2212 1 is\neven, the primes p in (2) can be alternatively described as the primes p such that\nDp is odd. These primes also have been the subject of study (by mathematicians\nincluding Sierpinski, Hasse and Odoni). Without assuming any hypothesis, it can\nbe shown that the proportion of primes p such that the order of g modulo p with g\nany prescribed integer is odd, exists and is a computable rational number. It turns\nout (cf. [Ba, Theorem 3.1.3] or [Mo1, Corollary 1]), that if the base B is not of\nthe form \u00b1u2 or \u00b12u2 for any u \u2208 N, then the proportion of primes p (among all\nprimes) with odd period, is 1/3. Thus the proportion of the primes in (2) equals 1/3.\nConcerning the primes in (3). The proportion of primes such that Dp is even\nequals 1 \u2212 1/3 = 2/3. Thus, on assuming GRH, the proportion of primes (3) equals\n2/3 \u2212 A. As shown in Lemma 8 above, B has even period mod p with p \u2224 2B iff p\ndivides B l + 1 for some l \u2265 1. Thus the even period condition modulo p is related\nto the divisibility of certain sequences by p.\nIn brief, we have arrived at the following result:\nProposition 4. Assume GRH. Then the natural densities of the sets of primes (1),\n(2), respectively (3), are given in the table below.\n\n\fDIVISIBILITY TESTS AND RECURRING DECIMALS IN EUCLIDEAN DOMAINS\n\n21\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\u03b4\nA\n1/3\n2/3 \u2212 A\n\u2248\u03b4\n0.37395 . . . 0.33333 . . . 0.29271 . . .\nKvant\n9/24\n8/24\n7/24\n\u2248\n0.37500 . . . 0.33333 . . . 0.29166 . . .\nWe next look at the residual index cp = [(Z/pZ)\u00d7 : hBi] (mentioned above),\nwhich was also equal to the number of distinct chains of recurring decimals (in base\nB). Recall that we had bp cp = p \u2212 1, where bp is the order of B modulo p.\nNote that given a fixed m \u2208 N, the number of primes p such that bp = m is finite,\nsince there are only finitely many primes less than B m . We now ask for the density\nof the set of primes for which the residual index is fixed, namely {p prime : cp = m}.\n(Note that if m = 1, then this was Artin's conjecture.)\nThis too has been answered: in [Mu1] we find that assuming the GRH, the den(m)\n(m)\nsity of this set NB equals CB for certain B, which has been explicitly mentioned\ntherein. This density roughly decreases in the order of m\u22122 . Similar results were\nobtained for arbitrary B by Wagstaff [Wa].\nFinally, we ask how often the order of B modulo p differs from that modulo p2 .\nRelated to this is the question: how often does p2 divide B p\u22121 \u2212 1 (or not) ? This\nis related to the Wieferich criterion, which first arose in the study of Fermat's last\ntheorem.\nFor x \u2208 N, let us denote the primes less than x, in each of the two sets above,\nby S1 (x) and S2 (x), respectively. Note that every prime occurs either in S1 or in\nS2 . From [Mu2] we see, roughly speaking, that the size of S2 (x) can be normally\napproximated (if B > 1) by a constant times ln ln x.\nMoreover, if we assume the abc-conjecture to be true, then we infer (cf. [Si]) that,\nas x tends to infinity, the cardinality of {p \u2264 x : p2 \u2224 (B p\u22121 \u2212 1)} exceeds cB ln x,\nwhere cB depends on B but not on x.\nAcknowledgments : Thanks are due to Travis Schedler for finding the counterexample p = 487 in Section 5 above, to Richard Cudney for first telling me about\nArtin's conjecture, to Professor Dan Shapiro, for telling me about the various references mentioned in Section 6 above, and to the referee for his suggestions.
