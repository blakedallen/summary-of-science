INTRODUCTION\n\nFluctuations occur in a system perturbed slightly away from equilibrium. The responses\nto these fluctuations are described by transport coefficients which characterize the dynamics of long wavelength, low frequency fluctuations in the medium [1,2]. The investigation\nof transport coefficients in high temperature gauge theories is important in cosmological\napplications such as electroweak baryogenesis [3] and in the context of heavy ion collisions\n[4].\nThere are two basic methods to calculate transport coefficients: transport theory and\nresponse theory [5\u201312]. Using the transport theory method one starts from a local equilibrium form for the distribution function and performs an expansion in the gradient of the\nfour-velocity field. The coefficients of this expansion are determined from the classical Boltzmann equation [10,12]. In the response theory approach one divides the Hamiltonian into a\nbare piece and a perturbative piece that is linear in the gradient of the four-velocity field.\nOne uses standard perturbation theory to obtain the Kubo formula for the viscosity in terms\nof retarded green functions [6]. These green functions are then evaluated using equilibrium\nquantum field theory. As is typical in finite temperature field theory, it is not sufficient to\ncalculate perturbatively in the coupling constant: there are certain infinite sets of diagrams\nthat contribute at the same order in perturbation theory and have to be resummed [13,14].\nIn this paper, we want to compare these two methods. The response theory approach\nallows us to calculate transport coefficients from first principles using the well understood\nmethods of quantum field theory. On the other hand, the transport theory approach involves\nthe use of the Boltzmann equation which is itself derived from some more fundamental theory\nusing, among other things, the quasiparticle approximation. In this sense, the response theory approach is more fundamental than the transport theory method. However, the response\ntheory approach can be quite difficult to implement, even for a high temperature weakly\ncoupled scalar theory, because of the need to resum infinite sets of diagrams [13,14]. These\nconsiderations motivate us to understand more precisely the connection between the more\npractical transport theory method, and the more fundamental response theory approach.\nSome progress has already been made in this direction. It has been shown that keeping\nonly terms which are linear in the gradient expansion in the transport theory calculation is\nequivalent to using the linear response approximation to obtain the usual Kubo formula for\nthe shear viscosity in terms of a retarded two-point function, and calculating that two-point\nfunction using standard equilibrium quantum field theory techniques to resum an infinite\nset of ladder diagrams [10,15,16]. This result is not surprising since it has been known for\nsome time that ladder diagrams give large contributions to n-point functions with ultra soft\nexternal lines [14].\nTo date, calculations of transport coefficients have been limited to linear response. In\nsome physical situations however nonlinear response can be important, especially for relativistic gauge theories [17\u201320]. It is therefore of interest to study nonlinear response. In\nthis paper we study nonlinear response to fluctuations in weakly coupled high temperature\nscalar \u03c64 theory using both the transport method and the response theory approach. We\nstudy the relationship between these two approaches at the level of quadratic response.\nThis paper will be organized as follows. In section II we define shear viscosity and\nquadratic shear viscous response using a hydrodynamic expansion of the energy-momentum\n2\n\n\ftensor which includes up to quadratic terms in the gradient of the four-velocity. In section\nIII we calculate viscosity using the transport theory method by performing a gradient expansion on the Boltzmann equation and obtaining a hierarchy of equations. In section IV\nwe derive the quadratic response Kubo formula by using Zubrave's techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. We obtain an expression which relates the quadratic shear\nviscous response coefficient to the three-point retarded green function of the viscous shear\nstress tensor. Starting from this generalized Kubo formula we calculate the quadratic shear\nviscous response using standard techniques of finite temperature quantum field theory. We\nshow that the quadratic shear viscous response can be obtained as an integral over a fourpoint vertex. This four-point vertex satisfies an integral equation involving terms which are\nquadratic in a retarded three-point function, which itself satisfies a linear integral equation.\nThese two integral equations represent the resummation of an infinite series of ladder and\nextended-ladder diagrams. We show that these integral equations, which represent ladder\nand extended-ladder resummations, have the same form as the first two equations in the\nhierarchy obtained from expanding the Boltzmann equation. We discuss our results and\npresent our conclusions section V.\nII. VISCOSITY\n\nIn a system that is out of equilibrium, the existence of gradients in thermodynamic\nparameters like the temperature and the four dimensional velocity field give rise to thermodynamic forces. These thermodynamic forces lead to deviations from the equilibrium\nexpectation value of the energy momentum tensor which are characterized by transport\ncoefficients like the thermal conductivity and the shear and bulk viscosities. In order to\nseparate these different physical processes we decompose the energy-momentum tensor as,\nT \u03bc\u03bd = \u01ebu\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 p\u2206\u03bc\u03bd + P \u03bc u\u03bd + P \u03bd u\u03bc + \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd ;\n\n\u2206\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe quantities \u01eb, p, P\u03bc and \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd have the physical meanings of internal energy density,\npressure, heat current and viscous shear stress, respectively. The four vector u\u03bc (x) is the four\ndimensional four-velocity field which satisfies u\u03bc (x)u\u03bc (x) = 1. The expansion coefficients\nare given by\n\u01eb = u\u03b1 u\u03b2 T \u03b1\u03b2\n1\np = \u2212 \u2206\u03b1\u03b2 T \u03b1\u03b2\n3\nP\u03bc = \u2206\u03bc\u03b1 u\u03b2 T \u03b1\u03b2\n\n(2.2)\n\n1\n\u03c0\u03bc\u03bd = (\u2206\u03bc\u03b1 \u2206\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 \u2206\u03bd\u03bc \u2206\u03b1\u03b2 )T \u03b1\u03b2 .\n3\nThe viscosity is obtained from the expectation value of the viscous shear stress part of\nthe energy momentum tensor. We expand in gradients of the four-velocity field and write,\nT2\n\u03b4h\u03c0\u03bc\u03bd i = \u03b7 (1) H\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b7 (2) H\u03bc\u03bd\n+***\n2\nH\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc u\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd u\u03bd \u2212 \u2206\u03bc\u03bd \u2206\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202 \u03c1 u\u03c3\n3\n1\nT2\nH\u03bc\u03bd\n:= H\u03bc\u03c1 H \u03c1\u03bd \u2212 \u2206\u03bc\u03bd H\u03c1\u03c3 H \u03c1\u03c3\n3\n\n3\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere \u03b7 (1) and \u03b7 (2) are the coefficients of the terms that are linear and quadratic respectively\nin the gradient of the four-velocity. The first coefficient is the usual shear viscosity. The\nsecond has has not been widely discussed in the literature \u2013 we shall call it the quadratic\nshear viscous response.\nThroughout this paper we work with \u03c64 theory. The Lagrangian for this theory is\n\u03bb\n1\nL = [(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 ] \u2212 \u03c64\n2\n4!\n\n(2.4)\n\nand the coupling constant is assumed to be small: \u03bb \u226a 1.\nIII. VISCOSITY FROM TRANSPORT THEORY\n\nKinetic theory and the Boltzmann equation can be used to calculate transport properties of dilute many-body systems. One assumes that, except during brief collisions, the\nsystem can be considered as being composed of classical particles with well defined position,\nenergy and momentum. This picture is valid when the mean free path is large compared\nwith the Compton wavelength of the particles. At high temperature the typical mean free\npath of thermal excitations is O(1/\u03bb2 T ) and is always larger\nthan the typical Compton\n\u221a\nwavelength of effective thermal oscillations which is O(1/ \u03bbT ) [10]. We introduce a phase\nspace distribution function f (x, k) which describes the evolution of the phase space probability density for the fundamental particles comprising a fluid. In this expression and in the\nfollowing equations the underlined momenta are on shell, since we are describing a system\nof particles. The form for f (x, k) in local equilibrium is,\nf (0) =\n\n1\n\u03bc\ne\u03b2(x)u\u03bc (x)k\n\n\u22121\n\n:= nk ; Nk := 1 + 2nk .\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe study the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic regime where we consider times\nwhich are long compared to the mean free time and describe the relaxation of the system\nin terms of long wavelength fluctuations in locally conserved quantities. For a simple fluid\nwithout any additional conserved charges, the only locally conserved quantities are energy\nand momentum. To solve the Boltzmann equation in this near equilibrium hydrodynamic\nregime, we expand the distribution function around the local equilibrium form using a\ngradient expansion. We go to a local rest frame in which we can write ~u(x) = 0. Note that\nthis does not imply that gradients of the form \u2202i uj must be zero.

These two functions are the\ncoefficients of the linear and quadratic terms in the gradient expansion of the distribution\nfunction. In the next section we will show that these functions can be obtained from the\nfirst two equations in the hierarchy of equations obtained from the gradient expansion of\nthe Boltzmann equation.\nA. Expansion of the Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation describes the evolution of the distribution function f (x, k) and\ncan be used to obtain integral equations for the functions B(k) and C(k) defined in (3.5)\nand (3.7). The Boltzmann equation has the form:\nk \u03bc \u2202 \u03bc f (x, k) = C[f ]\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere C[f ] is the collision term:\n1\nC[f ] =\n2\n\nZ\n\n123\n\nd \u039312\u21943k [f1 f2 (1 + f3 )(1 + fk ) \u2212 (1 + f1 )(1 + f2 )f3 fk ]\n\n(3.14)\n\nwith fi := f (x, pi ), fk := f (x, k).

Using the expansion (3.3) and (3.5)\nproduces a hierarchy of equations.\n1. First Order Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe first order equation is:\nk \u03bc \u2202\u03bc f 0 (x, k) = C[f (0) ; f (1) ]\n6\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fwhere we keep terms linear in f (1) on the right hand side. The left hand side gives,\n1\nk \u03bc \u2202\u03bc f 0 (x, k) = \u2212nk (1 + nk )\u03b2 Iij (k)Hij\n2\n\n(3.17)\n\nZ\n\n(3.18)\n\nThe right hand side is\nC[f\n\n(1)\n\n1\n]=\n2\n\n123\n\nd \u039312\u21943k (1 + n1 )(1 + n2 )n3 nk (\u03c6k + \u03c63 \u2212 \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )\n\nUsing the definition of \u03c6 given in (3.5) and comparing the coefficients of Hij on both sides\nof (3.16) we obtain,\n(1 + n1 )(1 + n2 )n3\n1Z\n[Bij (p1 ) + Bij (p2 ) \u2212 Bij (k) \u2212 Bij (p3 ) ]\nd \u039312\u21943k\nIij (k) =\n2 123\n1 + nk\n\n(3.19)\n\nThis result is an inhomogeneous linear integral equation which can be solved self-consistently\nto obtain the function Bij (k).\n2. Second Order Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe second order contribution to (3.13) is,\nk \u03bc \u2202\u03bc f (1) (x, k) = C[f (0) ; f (1) ; f (2) ]\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere we keep terms linear in f (2) and quadratic in f (1) on the right hand side.

VISCOSITY FROM FIELD THEORY\n\nThe Kubo formulae allow us to use quantum field theory to calculate nonequilibrium\ntransport coefficients. The results should be the same as those obtained in the previous\nsection using transport theory. To do calculations in a system that is out of equilibrium, the\nHamiltonian is separated into an equilibrium piece H0 and a nonequilibrium piece Hext which\ndepends on the gradients of the thermodynamic parameters: the four-velocity field and the\ninverse temperature field. For systems close to equilibrium the nonequilibrium piece of the\nHamiltonian can be treated as a perturbation and the deviations of physical quantities from\ntheir equilibrium values can be calculated perturbatively. The linear response calculation\nincludes only the first order contribution to this expansion and gives transport coefficients\nthat can be expressed as integrals of retarded two-point Green functions over space and\ntime. One of the results we obtain in this paper is that the quadratic shear viscous response\ncoefficient can be written in terms of a retarded three-point function. Throughout this\nsection we use\ncapital letters\nto denote four-vectors and small letters for three-vectors. We\nR 4\nR\n4\nalso define d p/(2\u03c0) := dP .\nTo calculate the expectation value of an operator we take the trace over the density\nmatrix. We follow the presentation of [8]. We work with the density matrix in the Heisenberg\nrepresentation which satisfies,\n\u2202\u03c1\n=0\n\u2202t\n\n(4.1)\n\nand can be written as,\n\u03c1=\n\ne\u2212A+B\nTre\u2212A+B\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere\nA=\nB=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd3 xF \u03bd T0\u03bd ,\nd3 x\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 e\u01eb(t \u2212t) T\u03bc\u03bd (x, t\u2032 )\u2202 \u03bc F \u03bd (x, t\u2032 )\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith F \u03bc = \u03b2u\u03bc and \u01eb to be taken to zero at the end. In this expression A is the equilibrium\npart of the Hamiltonian and B is a perturbative contribution that is linear in the gradient\nof the four-velocity field. Note that in the local rest frame u\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 0) and [A]LRF =\nR 3\nd x \u03b2T00 .

We have obtained a type of nonlinear Kubo formula that\nallows us to obtain the quadratic shear viscous response from a retarded three-point function\nusing equilibrium quantum field theory.\nB. Diagrammatic Expansion\n\nWe obtain a diagrammatic expansion for the viscosity coefficients given in (4.20) and\n(4.30). We use the closed time path formulation of finite temperature field theory, and\nwork in the Keldysh representation. Several reviews of this technique are available in the\nliterature [22\u201326]. The closed time path integration contour involves two branches, one\nrunning from minus infinity to positive infinity just above the real axis, and one running\nback from positive infinity to negative infinity just below the real axis. All fields can take\n12\n\n\fvalues on either branch of the contour and thus there is a doubling of the number of degrees\nof freedom. It is straightforward to show that this doubling of degrees of freedom is necessary\nto obtain finite green functions. We discuss below the structure of correlation functions of\nfield operators.\nThe two-point function or the propagator can be written as a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of the form\nD=\n\n\u0012\n\nD11\nD21\n\nD12\nD22\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhere D11 is the propagator for fields moving along C1 , D12 is the propagator for fields\nmoving from C1 to C2 , etc. The four components are given by\nD11 (X\nD12 (X\nD21 (X\nD22 (X\n\n\u2212 Y ) = \u2212ihT (\u03c6(X)\u03c6(Y ))i\n\u2212 Y ) = \u2212ih\u03c6(Y )\u03c6(X)i\n\u2212 Y ) = \u2212ih\u03c6(X)\u03c6(Y )i\n\u2212 Y ) = \u2212ihT\u0303 (\u03c6(X)\u03c6(Y ))i\n\n(4.32)\n\nwhere T is the usual time ordering operator and T\u0303 is the anti-chronological time ordering\noperator. Physical functions are obtained by taking appropriate combinations of the components of the propagator matrix. It is straightforward to show that the usual retarded and\nadvanced propagators: DR = \u2212i\u03b8(x0 \u2212 y0 )[\u03c6(X), \u03c6(Y )] and DA = \u2212i\u03b8(y0 \u2212 x0 )[\u03c6(X), \u03c6(Y )]\nare given by the combinations,\nDR = D11 \u2212 D12\nDA = D11 \u2212 D21 .\n\n(4.33)\n\nThe 1PI part of the two-point function, or the polarization insertion, is obtained by truncating legs. The retarded and advanced parts are given by,\n\u03a0R = \u03a011 + \u03a012\n\u03a0A = \u03a011 + \u03a021 .\n\n(4.34)\n\nThe situation is similar for higher n-point functions. For example, the three-point function which is retarded with respect to the first leg is given by\n\u0393R1 = \u0393111 + \u0393112 + \u0393121 + \u0393122 .\n\n(4.35)\n\nThe other three-point vertices that we will need are:\n\u0393R2 = \u0393111 + \u0393112 + \u0393211 + \u0393212\n\u0393R3 = \u0393111 + \u0393121 + \u0393211 + \u0393221\n\u0393F = \u0393111 + \u0393121 + \u0393212 + \u0393222\nThe four-point function which is retarded with respect to the first leg is given by,\nMR1 = M1111 + M1112 + M1121 + M1211 + M1122 + M1212 + M1221 + M1222 .\nThe other four-point vertices that we will need are:\n13\n\n(4.36)\n\n\fMR4 = M1111 + M1121 + M1211 + M2111 + M1221 + M2121 + M2211 + M2221\nMF = M1111 + M1121 + M1211 + M1221 + M2112 + M2212 + M2122 + M2222 .\n\n(4.37)\n\nThere are two relations that we can use to simplify expressions involving these vertices. The\nfirst is a consequence of the fact that real time green functions are related to each other\nthrough the KMS conditions. These identities are a consequence of symmetries generated\nthrough cyclic permutations of field operators. The identity that we will need is [21],\n\u0393F + N1 \u0393R3 + N3 \u0393R1 = (N1 + N3 )\u0393\u2217R2\n\n(4.38)\n\nwhere each vertex carries arguments \u0393(P1 , P2 , P3 ) and we write N(P1 ) := N1 etc. The\nsecond simplification occurs because of the fact that the equations we obtain contain a\nspecific combination of four-point vertices which we define as,\nM\u0304F = MF + N1 MR4 + N4 MR1\n\n(4.39)\n\nwhere each vertex carries arguments M(P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ). It has been shown that this particular\ncombination of four-point vertices has special properties in a number of other contexts [27].\nIn addition, bare vertices that carry a Keldysh index '2' have an extra factor of minus\none. This factor is accounted for by inserting a factor of \u03c4 for each vertex where \u03c4 is the\ntwo component vector given by,\n!\n\n1\n.\n\u03c4=\n\u22121\nWe want to obtain a perturbative expansion for the correlation functions of composite\noperators DR (X, Y ) and GR1 (X, Y, Z) which appear in (4.20) and (4.30). We obtain expressions for these correlation functions in terms of the vertices \u0393ij and Mijlm which are defined\nas the vertices obtained by truncating external legs from the following connected vertices:\n\u0393C\nij = hTc \u03c0ij (X)\u03c6(Y )\u03c6(Z)i\n\nC\nMijlm\n= hTc \u03c0ij (X)\u03c0lm (Y )\u03c6(Z)\u03c6(W )i\n\n(4.40)\n\n1\n\u03c0ij (X) = \u2202i \u03c6(X)\u2202j \u03c6(X) \u2212 \u03b4ij (\u2202m \u03c6(X))(\u2202m \u03c6(X))\n3\n\n(4.41)\n\nwhere\n\nand Tc is the operator that time orders along the closed time path contour.

When {q0 , q0\u2032 } \u2192 0 the dominant contribution to the integral from these pairs of propagators is produced by what is called the pinch\neffect: the contour is \"pinched\" between the poles of the two propagators which gives rise to\na factor in the denominator that is proportional to the imaginary part of the propagators.\n15\n\n\fWe regulate the pinching singularity with the imaginary part of the hard thermal loop self\nenergy and obtain [15],\nrk ak+q \u2192 \u2212\n\n\u03c1k\n;\n2Im\u03a3k\n\n\u03c1k = i(rk \u2212 ak )\n\n(4.46)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the retarded part of the hard thermal loop self energy.\nNow we expand in q0 and q0\u2032 . In (4.43) we keep terms proportional to q0 since these terms\nare the only ones that contribute to (4.20); in (4.44) we keep terms proportional to q0 q0\u2032 since\nthese terms are the only ones that contribute to (4.30). In each term there are products\nof thermal factors of the form Nx \u2212 Nx+q and Nx \u2212 Nx+q\u2032 where x is some combination of\n{k, p, r}. The expansion of these thermal factors is straightforward:\nNx \u2212 Nx+q = 2q0 \u03b2nx (1 + nx ) + * * *\n\n(4.47)\n\nConsider the behaviour of the vertices when {q0 , q0\u2032 } \u2192 0. Using (4.43) and (4.46) in\n(4.20) it is easy to see that only the real part of \u0393R2 contributes. Similarly, using (4.44)\nand (4.46) in (4.30) it is clear that we need only the real part of M\u0304F . First we consider\n(4.43). Because of the explicit factor of (Nk+q \u2212 Nk ) we can set Q to zero in the vertex.\nThe expansion of (4.44) in Q and Q\u2032 is more difficult. One can show that the terms in the\nexpansion that contain gradients acting on the vertices MF , MR1 and MR4 do not contribute\nto the result and that we can make the replacement:\nReM\u0304F (K, Q, Q\u2032 , \u2212K \u2212 Q \u2212 Q\u2032 ) \u2192 (Nk \u2212 Nk+q+q\u2032 )ReMR1 (K, 0, 0, \u2212K)\n\n(4.48)\n\nFrom now on, to simplify the notation, we define \u0393(K, 0, \u2212K) := \u0393(K) and\nM(K, 0, 0, \u2212K) := M(K).\nUsing these results to simplify (4.43) and (4.44) and substituting into (4.20) and (4.30)\nwe obtain,\n\u03b7\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b7 (2)\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nRe\u0393R2 (K)\n\u03b2\ndK k 2 \u03c1k nk (1 + nk )\n=\n15\nIm\u03a3k\n#\n\"\n2 Z\n2\u03b2\nReMR1 (K)\n2\n=\u2212\ndK k \u03c1k nk (1 + nk )Nk\n105\nIm\u03a3k\nZ\n\n(4.49)\n(4.50)\n\nComparing with (3.11) and (3.12) we see that the results are identical if we identify\nRe\u0393R2 (k)\nIm\u03a3k\nReMR1 (k)\nC(k) = \u2212\nIm\u03a3k\n\nB(k) =\n\n(4.51)\n(4.52)\n\nwith the momentum K on the shifted mass shell: \u03b4(K 2 \u2212 m2th ) where m2th = m2 + Re\u03a3K .\n1. The Ladder Resummation\n\nIt has been known for some time that the set of diagrams which give the dominate\ncontributions to the vertex \u0393ij (P, Q, \u2212P \u2212 Q) are the ladder diagrams. These diagrams\n16\n\n\fcontribute to the viscosity to the same order in perturbation theory as the bare one loop\ngraph and thus need to be resummed [10]. This effect occurs for the following reason. It\nappears that the ladder graphs are suppressed relative to the one loop graph by extra powers\nof the coupling which come from the extra vertex factors that one obtains when one adds\nrungs (vertical lines). However, these extra factors of the coupling are compensated for by a\nkinematical factor. This factor arises through the pinch effect which is described above. The\naddition of an additional rung in a ladder graph always produces an extra pair of propagators\nof the form ak rk+q or rk ak+q . Products of this form contribute a factor which produces an\nenhancement. This factor occurs when the contour is \"pinched\" between the poles of the\ntwo propagators, which gives rise to a contribution in the denominator that is proportional\nto the imaginary part of the inverse propagators.\nIn order to include ladder diagrams we obtain the vertex \u0393\u0303ij (P, Q, \u2212P \u2212Q) as the solution\nto the integral equation shown in Fig. [2].\n\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n11\n00\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n001111\n11\n0000\n0000\n1111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n11\n00\n000\n111\n11 1111\n00\n11 111\n00\n000111\n000\n000\n111\n11\n000\n111\n+ 1/2 00\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n\n0000\n1111\n\nFig. [2]: Integral equation for the ladder resummation.

To simplify this expression further we use (4.45), (4.51) and the fact that \u0393R2 (P ) is\npure real, and symmetrize the integral on the right hand side over the integration variables\n{P, P \u2032, R}.

When the delta functions are used to do\nthe frequency integrals, this equation has exactly the same form as the equation obtained\nfrom the linearized Boltzmann equation (3.19) with a shifted mass shell describing effective\nthermal excitations. Comparing (3.11) and (3.19) with (4.49) and (4.56) we conclude that\ncalculating shear viscosity using effective transport theory by keeping only first order terms in\nthe gradient expansion is equivalent to using the Kubo formula obtained from linear response\ntheory, with a three-point vertex obtained by resumming ladder graphs.

We introduce some notation to simplify the equations. For four-point vertices we list\nthe first three momenta only and for three-point vertices we list the first two only.

As discussed previously, we expand in q0 and q0\u2032\nand keep the term proportional to q0 q0\u2032 , since that is the only term that will contribute to\nthe quadratic shear viscous response coefficient. As before, one can show that the terms\nin the expansion that contain gradients acting on the vertices MF , MR1 and MR4 do not\ncontribute to the result and that we can use (4.48).

CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied nonlinear response using two different methods. The first method uses\nstandard transport theory. We start from a local equilibrium form for the distribution function and perform a gradient expansion. We calculate the quadratic shear viscous response\ncoefficient by expanding the Boltzmann equation and obtaining a hierarchy of equations\nthat can be solved consistently. The second technique uses response theory. We work with\na perturbative Hamiltonian that is linear in the gradient of the four-velocity field and study\nquadratic response. We generalize the Kubo formula for linear response and obtain an\nexpression that allows us to calculate quadratic shear viscous response from the retarded\nthree-point green function of the viscous shear stress tensor. The transport theory calculation involves the use of the Boltzmann equation which is itself obtained from some more\nfundamental theory. The response theory calculation uses the well known methods of equilibrium finite temperature quantum field theory and is, in this sense, more fundamental.\nHowever, the response theory calculation is complicated by the need to resum infinite sets\nof diagrams at finite temperature.\nAt leading order, it is well known that a correct calculation of the linear response coefficient involves the resummation of ladder graphs. Beyond leading order in response theory\nit is difficult even to identify which diagrams need to be resummed. We have identified\nprecisely which diagrams need to be resummed by studying the connection between the\ntransport theory calculation and the response theory calculation. We have shown that calculating the quadratic shear viscous response coefficient using transport theory by keeping\nterms that are quadratic in the gradient of the four-velocity field in the expansion of the\nBoltzmann equation, is equivalent to calculating the same response coefficient from quantum field theory at finite temperature using the next-to-linear response Kubo formula with\na vertex given by a specific integral equation. This integral equation shows that the complete set of diagrams that need to be resummed includes the standard ladder graphs, and\nan additional set of extended ladder graphs.\nThere are several directions for future work. It has been shown that the Boltzmann equation can be derived from the Kadanoff-Baym equations by using a gradient expansion and\nkeeping only linear terms [29]. The connection between this result and the work discussed in\n23\n\n\fthis paper can probably be understood by studying the dual roles of the gradient expansion\nand the quasiparticle approximation. In addition, it would be interesting to generalize this\nwork to gauge field theories.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering and Research Council\nof Canada (NSERC), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).\n\n24\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] H.-Th.
