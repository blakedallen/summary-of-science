PAULSEN\nAbstract. We develop a symbol calculus for normal bimodule maps\nover a masa that is the natural analogue of the Schur product theory.\nUsing this calculus we are able to easily give a complete description\nof the ranges of contractive normal bimodule idempotents that avoids\nthe theory of J*-algebras. \u221aWe prove that if P is a normal bimodule\nidempotent and kP k < 2/ 3 then P is a contraction. We finish with\nsome attempts at extending the symbol calculus to non-normal maps.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet H be a Hilbert space and let B(H) denote the algebra of bounded\nlinear operators on H. If P : B(H) \u2192 B(H) is a completely contractive\nidempotent, then it is known that its range M = P (B(H)) can be endowed\nwith a triple product that makes it a ternary ring of operators (TRO). That\nis, there exists a unital C \u2217 -algebra, A, a self-adjoint idempotent q \u2208 A, and\na complete onto isometry \u03c6 : M \u2192 qA(1 \u2212 q), such that the triple product\non M is given by {m1 , m2 , m3 } = \u03c6(m1 )\u03c6(m2 )\u2217 \u03c6(m3 ).\nThe presence of the map \u03c6 means that the triple product, in general, has\nlittle relation to the product inherited from B(H). However, when P is also\nassumed to be a bimodule map with respect to a masa in B(H), then Solel\n[So] has shown that considerably more is true.\nLet D \u2286 B(H) be a masa acting on a separable Hilbert space H and let\nP : B(H) \u2192 B(H) be a contractive idempotent D-bimodule map. In case\nP is also w*-continuous, Solel [So] proves that the range M = P (B(H)) is\nactually a ternary ring of operators (TRO) in the product inherited from\nB(H), i.e., it satisfies MM\u2217 M \u2286 M. We summarize this stronger condition\nby saying that M is a sub-TRO of B(H).\nWe give a new proof of Solel's result, that does not need any J*-algebra\ntheory, and in fact obtain the stronger\nP conclusion that M must be the w*closed sum of \"full corners\", M = n B(Hn , Kn ) where {Hn } and {Kn } are\npairwise orthogonal subspaces of H and K respectively. From this description of M it is immediate that MM\u2217 M \u2286 M.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 46L15; Secondary 47L25.\nResearch supported in part by a grant from the University of Athens (A. Katavolos)\nand the NSF (V.I. Paulsen)\nPreliminary versions of this work were announced by the authors in 2001 and 2002, in\nparticular during the Workshop on Nonself-adjoint Operator Algebras held at the Fields\nInstitute (see http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/audio/02-03/nsoa/paulsen/).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. KATAVOLOS AND V. I. PAULSEN\n\nIn addition, representing D as the multiplication masa of a standard Borel\nspace (X, \u03bc), we show that the \u03c9-support (see [EKS]) of the range M of a\nw*-continuous idempotent D-bimodule map (whether contractive or not)\nis \u03c9-open (as well as \u03c9-closed). It follows [EKS] that the reflexive cover\nRef(M) of M is strongly reflexive.\nWe begin by examining the case when H = l2 and D = l\u221e in some detail.\nIn this case every D-bimodule map \u03a6 is well-known to be given by Schur\nmultiplication against a fixed matrix A = (ai,j ), that is, \u03a6(X) = A \u2217 X =\n(ai,j xi,j ). We denote this map by \u03a6 = SA .\nNote that \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03a6 is clearly equivalent to a2i,j = ai,j and hence each\nentry of A must be either 0 or 1. Thus every idempotent \u03a6 can be identified\nin a one-to-one fashion with a subset E \u2286 N\u00d7N where E = {(i, j) : ai,j = 1}\nand we write A = \u03c7E , where we regard the matrix A as a function of two\nvariables.\nThe problem of determining ranges of bounded bimodule projections, becomes one of determining which subsets of N \u00d7 N give rise to bounded bimodule projections.\nWhen a non-zero idempotent Schur product map has norm less than\n\u221a\n2/ 3, then Livshits [Li] proves that it must actually be of norm 1. We\npresent a somewhat different proof of this result, based on a combinatorial\n\"3 of 4\" lemma, that gives a description of these sets that generalizes more\nreadily from the case of discrete masa's to continuous masa's.\nVery little is known about the structure of sets such that \u03a6 is only a\nbounded projection, but we give, hopefully, a little insight into this problem.\nIn the third section, we use Haagerup's results [Haa] to develop a symbol\ncalculus for w*-continuous bimodule maps over general masa's. One of the\nmain advantages of our approach is that the symbol calculus allows proofs\ngiven in the discrete case to carry over to arbitrary masa's. In particular,\nwe prove that\n\u221a every non-zero w*-continuous bimodule projection of norm\nless than 2/ 3 is actually of norm 1. Thus, the set of possible norms of\nw*-continuous bimodule projections is not a connected subset of the reals.\nIt is not known if the same phenomenon holds for all bounded bimodule\nprojections.\nIn the final section we study masa bimodule maps that are not w*continuous. Solel [So] conjectures that the range of an idempotent contractive masa bimodule map P will still be a sub-TRO even when P is not\nw*-continuous. We use the actions of such maps on normalizers of the bimodule as an approach to the problem of extending our symbol calculus\nbeyond the w*-continuous case.\nIf P is a contractive idempotent (hence kP k = 1) and its range is a\nD-bimodule, then P is automatically a D-bimodule map ([So]).\nThe authors would like to thank Ken Davidson, Allan Donsig, Gilles Pisier\nand Ivan Todorov for various observations that have improved our exposition\nand results.\n\n\fON THE RANGES OF BIMODULE PROJECTIONS\n\n3\n\n2. The Discrete Case\nIn this section we develop the case where the masa is totally atomic, so\nour Hilbert space may be represented as l2 and the masa as l\u221e acting in\nthe usual fashion as diagonal matrices. Identifying l2 = L2 (N, \u03bc), leads to\nthe identification of l\u221e = L\u221e (N, \u03bc) acting as multiplication operators on\nthis space of functions.\nDefinition 1. Let X and Y be sets and let E \u2286 X \u00d7 Y . We say that E has\nthe 3 of 4 property provided that given any distinct pair of points x1 6= x2\nin X and any pair of distinct points y1 6= y2 in Y , whenever 3 of the 4\nordered pairs (xi , yj ) belong to E then the fourth ordered pair belongs to E\nalso.\nLemma 2. Let X and Y be sets and let E \u2286 X \u00d7 Y . If E has the 3 of\n4 property, then there exists an index set T , disjoint subsets {Xt }t\u2208T of X,\nand disjoint subsets {Yt }t\u2208T of Y such that\nE = \u222at\u2208T Xt \u00d7 Yt .\n\nProof. Define a relation on X by x1 Rx2 if and only if there exists y \u2208 Y\nsuch that (x1 , y) and (x2 , y) are both in E. The 3 of 4 property ensures that\nR is transitive and hence is an equivalence relation on the subset X0 = {x \u2208\nX : (x, y) \u2208 E for some y \u2208 Y } of X. Let {Xt }t\u2208T denote the collection of\nequivalence classes of X0 .\nDefine Yt = {y \u2208 Y : (x, y) \u2208 E for some x \u2208 Xt }. Again the 3 of 4\nproperty ensures that the sets Yt are disjoint with union equal to\nY0 = {y \u2208 Y : (x, y) \u2208 E for some x \u2208 X}.\n\nOne final use of the 3 of 4 property shows that E = \u222at\u2208T Xt \u00d7 Yt .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following result is also Lemma 3 of [Li], but the proof is short, so we\ninclude it.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\nLemma 3. Let A =\nand let SA : M2 \u2192 M2 denote the map given\n0 1\n\u221a\nas Schur product by A. Then kSA k = 2/ 3.\nProof. Since the unitaries are the\u0012extreme points\n\u0013 of the unit ball of M2 , it\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\nis easily seen that kSA k = sup\u03b8\nand the result follows by\n0\ncos \u03b8\ncomputing this supremum.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4. Let P : B(l2 ) \u2192 B(l2 ) be a non-zero l\u221e -bimodule map that\nis idempotent,\nlet M = P (B(l2 )) denote the range of P and assume that\n\u221a\nkP k < 2/ 3. Then:\n(i) P = S\u03c7E where E = \u222aIm \u00d7 Jm , with {Im } and {Jm } countable\ncollections\nP of disjoint subsets of N,\n(ii) M = m \u03c7Im B(l2 )\u03c7Jm and MM\u2217 M \u2286 M,\n(iii) kP k = 1.\n\n\f4\n\nA. KATAVOLOS AND V. I. PAULSEN\n\nProof. The fact that P = S\u03c7E for some set E \u2286 N \u00d7 N was noted in the\nintroduction. Choose any x1 6= x2 and y1 6= y2 in N and consider the compression of P as \u221a\na map from the span of {ex1 , ex2 } to the span of {ey1 , ey2 }.\nSince kP k < 2/ 3, by the above lemma E will have the 3 of 4 property\nand hence by the first lemma be of the form given in (i). It is now obvious\nthat M will have the form claimed in (ii). The second assertion in (ii) is\nimmediate from this.\nAlternatively, to see the second assertion in (ii), note that it is enough\nto assume that the matrix units Ei,j , Ek,l and Em,n are in M and prove\n\u2217 E\nthat Ei,j Ek,l\nm,n is in M. But this product will be 0 unless j = l and\nk = m in which case the product is Ei,n . However, in this case we have that\n(i, j), (k, j), (k, n) belong to E and so again by the 3 of 4 property (i, n) is\nin E and so Ei,n \u2208 M.\nFinally, to prove (iii), let {em } denote the usual basis of l2 , set xi = em\nwhen i \u2208 Im , set yj = em when j \u2208 Jm and note that \u03c7E (i, j) = hxi , yj i.\nThus, kP k \u2264 1 by the theorem characterizing the norms of Schur product\nmaps, see for example [Pa].\n\u0003\nTheorem 4(iii), with a somewhat longer proof, is contained explicitly in\n[Li] and (i) and (ii) can be obtained from the proof given there.\nIt is well known that the range of a completely contractive projection is\ncompletely isometrically isomorphic to a TRO on some Hilbert space H.\nThis result induces a triple product on the range, but it is generally not the\ntriple product given by the original representation of the range as a subspace\nof B(H). Note that by (ii), we have that the range of P is a TRO in the\noriginal triple product, i.e., that the range is a sub-TRO of B(l2 ).\nRemark 5. By the above result we see that the set of possible \u221anorms of\nbimodule projections does not contain the interval from 1 to 2/ 3. This\nmakes the structure of this set somewhat intriguing. Davidson has observed\nthat the set of possible norms is closed under product and under the taking\nof suprema. By a result of Bhatia, Choi and Davis [BCD], the number 2 is\none of the limit points of this set. Other than these facts, not much seems\nto be known about this set.\nIf we let \u2206 = {E \u2286 N \u00d7 N : S\u03c7E is bounded }, then, by the results\ncharacterizing the norms of Schur product maps, it is easily seen that E \u2208 \u2206\nif and only if there exist bounded sequences of vectors, {xi } and {yj }, such\nthat \u03c7E (i, j) = hxi , yj i, but this characterization seems to be of little help\nin obtaining other conditions that characterize the sets in \u2206.\nIt is not hard to show that \u2206 is an algebra of sets and so contains the\nalgebra generated by the sets given by the above theorem. It is not currently\nknown whether \u2206 equals the latter algebra.\n\n\fON THE RANGES OF BIMODULE PROJECTIONS\n\n5\n\n3. A Functional Calculus\nIn the discrete case, every bounded bimodule map is given as a Schur\nproduct map and so is automatically w*-continuous, but this is not the\ncase in general. In this section we develop a functional calculus in the nondiscrete case for w*-continuous bimodule maps that allows us to treat these\nexactly like Schur product maps and consequently obtain exact analogues\nof the results of the previous section.\nThis functional calculus is different from the one considered by Peller [Pe],\nand appears to have recently been discovered independently by Shulman and\nKissin [KS].\nLet D \u2286 B(H) be a masa acting on a separable Hilbert space H and\nlet \u03a6 : B(H) \u2192 B(H) be a w*-continuous D-bimodule map. Since \u03a6 is a\nbounded D-bimodule map, a result of R. Smith [Smi] (see also [DP]) shows\nthat \u03a6 must be completely bounded, and in fact k\u03a6kcb = k\u03a6k.\nHaagerup [Haa] has shown that a w*-continuous completely bounded Dbimodule map such as \u03a6 must be of the form\n\u03a6(T ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nFn T Gn\n\nn=1\n\n(T \u2208 B(H))\n\nP\nP\nfor suitable Fn , Gn \u2208 D satisfying k Fn Fn\u2217 k < \u221e and k G\u2217n Gn k < \u221e.\nRepresent D as the multiplication masa of a standard (finite) Borel space\n(X, \u03bc) acting on H = L2 (X, \u03bc). A standard null-set argument shows that\nwe may choose two families {fn }, {gn } of Borel functions\nwith F\nn = Mfn\nP\nP\nand Gn = Mgn for each n, and such that the series\n|fn (t)|2 and\n|gn (t)|2\nconverge for all t \u2208 X boundedly and in L2 norm.\nIt follows that the series\nX\n\u03c6(s, t) =\nfn (s)gn (t)\nn\n\nconverges pointwise everywhere to a Borel function.\n\nConversely, let f = (f1 , f2 , . . .) and g = (g1 , g2 , . . .) be (essentially) bounded\nweakly Borel measurable functions from X into l2 .

Note\ndefines an element of the projective tensor product L2 (X, \u03bc)\u2297L\nthat the series converges pointwise absolutely and boundedly and also in the\nprojective norm. Thus the function \u03c6 is Borel on X \u00d7 X and (essentially)\nbounded.\nDenoting by Fn (resp. Gn ) the multiplication operator Mfn (resp. Mgn )\nacting\non H = L2 (X, \u03bc) we observe that for every T \u2208 B(H) the series\nP\nn Fn T Gn converges in the w*-topology. This is well known, and we sketch\nthe proof for completeness.\nThe fact that the bounds Bf and Bg defined above are finite shows that\nthe infinite matrices [G1 , G2 , . . .]t and [F1 , F2 , .p\n. .] define bounded\noperators\np\n(\u221e)\n(\u221e)\nH \u2192 (H)\nand (H)\n\u2192 H with norms Bg and Bf respectively.\nThus the matrix product [F1 , F2 , . . .]T (\u221e) [G1 , G2 , . . .]t , which wepdenote\nby \u03a6\u03c6 (T ), defines an operator\nP on H whose norm is at most kT k Bg Bf .\nThis operator is of course n Fn T Gn , the strong limit of its partial sums\nP\n\u03a6N (T ) p\n= N\nn=1 Fn T Gn ; but since these partial sums are uniformly bounded\nby kT k Bg Bf , the convergence is actually ultrastrong.\nClearly \u03a6\u03c6 is a D-bimodule map. We claim that it is w*-continuous. For\nthis, it suffices to show that it is weak operator continuous on the unit ball\nB(H)1 of B(H).

It follows that the\nfunction T \u2192 h\u03a6\u03c6 (T )\u03be, \u03b7i is the uniform limit on B(H)1 of the weak operator continuous functions T \u2192 h\u03a6N (T )\u03be, \u03b7i and so is itself weak operator\ncontinuous.\nNote that the map \u03a6\u03c6 acts as a multiplication operator on kernels of\nHilbert Schmidt operators:\nProposition 6. Let \u03c6(s, t) = hf (s), \u1e21(t)i where f and g are (essentially)\nbounded (weakly) Borel measurable functions from X into l2 , and let \u03a6\u03c6 :\nB(H) \u2192 B(H) be as above. The map \u03a6\u03c6 leaves the space of Hilbert Schmidt\noperators invariant. If T \u2208 B(H) is a Hilbert Schmidt operator with kernel\nk \u2208 L2 (X \u00d7 X), then \u03a6\u03c6 (T ) has kernel M\u03c6 (k) = \u03c6k. Thus \u03a6\u03c6 acts on\nL2 (X \u00d7 X) as multiplication by \u03c6.\nProof. Let T = Tk be Hilbert Schmidt operator with kernel k.

Recall that a set R \u2286 X \u00d7 X\nis called marginally null provided that there is a null set N such that\nR \u2286 (N \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 N ). We say that two functions \u03c6 and \u03c8 on X \u00d7 X are\nequal marginally almost everywhere and write \u03c6 = \u03c8 m.a.e. provided\nthat the set of points where they are not equal is marginally null.\nTheorem 7. Let \u03c6(s, t) = hf (s), \u1e21(t)i where f and g are (essentially)\nbounded (weakly) Borel measurable functions from X into l2 , and let \u03a6\u03c6 :\nB(H) \u2192 B(H) be as above. The following are equivalent:\n(1) \u03c6 = 0 m.a.e.\n(2) \u03c6 = 0 a.e.\n(3) \u03a6\u03c6 = 0.\n\nProof. If the set\nR = {(s, t) \u2208 X \u00d7 X : \u03c6(s, t) 6= 0}\n\nis contained in a set of the form N \u00d7 X \u222a X \u00d7 N , where N \u2286 X is null, then\nof course the product measure of R is 0. Thus (1) implies (2).\nTo show that (2) implies (3), observe that if T = Tk is a Hilbert-Schmidt\noperator with (square-integrable) kernel k, then by Proposition 6 \u03a6\u03c6 (Tk ) =\nT\u03c6k .\nIt follows that if \u03c6 = 0 a.e. then \u03a6\u03c6 (Tk ) = 0 for any Hilbert-Schmidt\noperator Tk . Since \u03a6\u03c6 is w*-continuous, we obtain \u03a6\u03c6 = 0. Conversely if\n\u03a6\u03c6 = 0 then \u03c6 = 0 a.e.\nIt remains to prove that if the set R is null, then it must be marginally\nnull. For this, first observe that R is (marginally equivalent to) a countable\nunion of Borel rectangles. We use an argument of Arveson [Arv]: The set\n{(\u03be, \u03b7) \u2208 l2 \u00d7 l2 : h\u03be, \u03b7i =\n6 0}\nis open in l2 \u00d7 l2 , and hence is a countable union \u222an Un \u00d7 Vn of open rectangles.

If N1 = \u222a{An : \u03bc(Bn ) 6= 0} and N2 = \u222a{Bn : \u03bc(An ) 6= 0}\nthen \u03bc(N1 ) = \u03bc(N2 ) = 0 and\nR \u2286 N1 \u00d7 X \u222a X \u00d7 N2\n\nwhich completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 8. We let N CBD (B(H)) denote the algebra of w*-continuous\nD-bimodule maps from B(H) into itself. Given a w*-continuous D-bimodule\nmap \u03a6 as above we call the m.a.e. equivalence class of the function \u03c6 obtained above the symbol of \u03a6 and denote it by \u0393(\u03a6).\nCorollary 9. Let D be represented as the multiplication masa on a standard\nBorel space (X, \u03bc), let Bmae (X \u00d7 X) denote the algebra of bounded Borel\nfunctions on X \u00d7 X modulo the marginally null functions. Then the map\n\u0393 : N CBD (B(H)) \u2192 Bmae (X \u00d7 X) is a one-to-one homomorphism onto\nthe subalgebra of functions that can be represented in the form \u03c6(s, t) =\nhf (s), g(t)i for any bounded Borel measurable functions f, g from X into a\nseparable Hilbert space.\nWe call the map \u0393 the functional calculus for w*-continuous D-bimodule\nmaps.\nArmed with the functional calculus, we can readily generalize the theorem\nof the previous section.\nTheorem 10. Let P : B(H) \u2192 B(H) be a D-bimodule map that is idempotent and w*-continuous,\nlet M = P (B(H)) denote the range of P and\n\u221a\nassume that kP k < 2/ 3. Then:\n(1) \u0393(P ) = \u03c7E where E = \u222aIm \u00d7 Jm , with {Im } and {Jm } countable\ncollections\nBorel subsets of X,\nP of disjoint\n2\n(2) M = m \u03c7Im B(L )\u03c7Jm and MM\u2217 M \u2286 M,\n(3) kP k = 1.\n\nProof. Let \u0393(P ) = \u03c6, since P \u25e6 P = P , by the functional calculus, \u03c62 = \u03c6\nmarginally almost everywhere. Thus, we can pick a Borel subset X1 of X\nwith \u03bc(X \u2229 X1c ) = 0 such that \u03c62 = \u03c6 on X1 \u00d7 X1 . Hence, there is a Borel\nsubset E of X1 \u00d7 X1 such that \u03c6 = \u03c7E as functions on X1 \u00d7 X1 .\nThus, we may write \u03c7E (s, t) = hf (s), g(t)i where\n\u221a f, g are functions into a\nseparable Hilbert space with kf (s)kkg(t)k < 2/ 3 for all s, t.\nBy Lemma 3, if for any s1 6= s2 and t1 6= t2 , we have that 3 of the 4 values\nhf (si ), g(tj )i are 1, then the fourth value must also be 1.\nHence the set E satisfies the 3 of 4 property and so it must be a union of\ndisjoint rectangles as in Lemma 2. Say, E = \u222at\u2208T It \u00d7 Jt .\n\n\fON THE RANGES OF BIMODULE PROJECTIONS\n\n9\n\nIt remains to be shown that the indexing set T for the union is only\ncountable and that each of the sets It and Jt are Borel. As in the proof\nof Theorem 7, the set E = {(s, t) \u2208 X1 \u00d7 X1 : \u03c6(s, t) 6= 0} can be written\nas a countable union of Borel rectangles, say E = \u222an An \u00d7 Bn . Again, by\nthe equivalence relation used to define the sets It and Jt , if any point in a\nrectangle An \u00d7 Bn is contained in It \u00d7 Jt then An \u00d7 Bn \u2286 It \u00d7 Jt . Hence, each\nset It \u00d7 Jt is the union of the at most countably many Borel rectangles that\nare contained in it and consequently is itself a Borel rectangle. Moreover,\nthe set T can be placed in a one-to-one correspondence with a partition of\nthe integers, and hence is countable.\nThe remainder of the proof proceeds as in the proof of Theorem 4.\n\u0003\nAs in the discrete case we have that M is a sub-TRO of B(L2 ), a result\nobtained by Solel [So].\nJust as in the discrete case, very little is known about bimodule projections of greater norm.\nMore importantly, very little is known about contractive bimodule projections that are not w*-continuous. Such projections do exist, for example\nprojections onto the masa D exist and when D is not discrete, these cannot be not w*-continuous. Solel [So] conjectures that the range M of any\ncontractive D-bimodule projection satisfies MM\u2217 M \u2286 M.\nWe now turn our attention to further properties of the symbol calculus\nand of bounded w*-continuous idempotents.\nRecall [EKS] that a subset E \u2286 X \u00d7 X is said to be \u03c9-open if it differs\nfrom a countable union of Borel rectangles by a marginally null set, and is\n\u03c9-closed if its complement is \u03c9-open. Thus the set E in Theorem 10 is\n\u03c9-open. The following Proposition strengthens this result and provides an\nalternative approach:\nProposition 11. Let P \u2208 N CBD (B(H)) be an idempotent with symbol\n\u0393(P ) = \u03c7. Then there exists an \u03c9-open and \u03c9-closed set A \u2286 X \u00d7 X such\nthat \u03c7 = \u03c7A marginally almost everywhere.\nProof. Notice first that, in the terminology of [EKS], any element \u03c6 of the\nb 2 (X) is \u03c9-continuous, that is, \u03c6\u22121 (U ) is\nprojective tensor product L2 (X)\u2297L\n\u03c9-open in X \u00d7 X for any open set U \u2286 C [EKS, Theorem 6.5].\nSince P is idempotent, so is its induced operator M\u03c7 on L2 (X \u00d7 X) (see\nProposition 6). It follows that \u03c72 = \u03c7 almost everywhere, i.e. the set\nB = {(s, t) : \u03c72 (s, t) \u2212 \u03c7(s, t) 6= 0}\n\nb 2 (X), the\nhas product measure zero. On the other hand, since \u03c7 \u2208 L2 (X)\u2297L\n2\nfunction \u03c7 is \u03c9-continuous hence so is \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7. Thus B must be \u03c9-open, in\nother words marginally equivalent to a countable union of rectangles. The\nfact that B has product measure zero now implies, as noted earlier, that it\nis actually marginally null. Replacing X by a suitable Borel subset X1 such\nthat \u03bc(X \u2229 X1c ) = 0, we may assume that B = \u2205, i.e. that \u03c72 (s, t) = \u03c7(s, t)\n\n\f10\n\nA. KATAVOLOS AND V. I. PAULSEN\n\nfor all (s, t) \u2208 X \u00d7 X. Thus letting A = \u03c7\u22121 ({1}) we see that A is \u03c9-closed\n(since \u03c7 is \u03c9-continuous); but Ac = \u03c7\u22121 ({0}) is also \u03c9-closed.\n\u0003\nIt is shown in [EKS] that, given any space S of operators on L2 (X), there\nexists an \u03c9-closed set \u03a9, minimal up to marginally null sets, that supports\nall elements of S, in the sense that if a Borel rectangle \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2 doesn't meet\n\u03a9 then M\u03b2 SM\u03b1 = {0} (here M\u03b2 \u2208 B(L2 (X)) denotes the projection onto\nL2 (\u03b2)). This set is called the \u03c9-support of S.\nProposition 12. Let P \u2208 N CBD (B(H)) be an idempotent with symbol\n\u0393(P ) = \u03c7A . Then the set A is (marginally equivalent to) the \u03c9-support of\nM = P (B(H)).\nProof. It is to be shown that a Borel rectangle \u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2 has marginally null\nintersection with A if and only if M\u03b2 MM\u03b1 = {0}. Note that the relation M\u03b2 MM\u03b1 = {0} is equivalent to M\u03b2 P (T )M\u03b1 = 0 for all T \u2208 B(H).\nBut, since the map T \u2192 M\u03b2 P (T )M\u03b1 is w*-continuous, this is equivalent\nto M\u03b2 P (T )M\u03b1 = 0 for all Hilbert Schmidt T = Tk . By Proposition 6\nM\u03b2 P (Tk )M\u03b1 = M\u03b2 T\u03c7k M\u03b1 = Th , where h = \u03c7\u03b1\u00d7\u03b2 \u03c7A k. Thus the relation\nM\u03b2 P (T )M\u03b1 = 0 holds for all Hilbert Schmidt T = Tk if and only if the set\n(\u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2) \u2229 A has product measure zero. But since this set is \u03c9-open, as shown\nin the proof of the last proposition this can only happen when (\u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2) \u2229 A\nis marginally null.\n\u0003\nSince A is \u03c9-open, it follows [EKS, Theorem 6.11] that the reflexive cover\nRef(M) is in fact strongly reflexive, and is the strong closure of the linear\nspan of the finite rank operators supported in A. In case P is actually\ncontractive, this of course follows immediately from the fact that the range\nof P is a direct sum of full corners (Theorem 10).\n4. Module maps and Normalizers\nWe conjecture that it is possible to extend the functional calculus of the\nprevious section beyond the w*-continuous module maps to a homomorphism from all of CBD (B(H)) into an algebra of functions. When D is a\ncontinuous masa, then [HW] proves that not only is CBD (B(H)) not abelian,\nbut that its center is exactly the w*-continuous maps, N CBD (B(H)).\nSince the range of the homomorphism that we hope to construct would\nbe contained in an abelian algebra, then necessarily this extended functional\ncalculus would need to annihilate the commutator ideal. For this reason, we\nseek a representation of this algebra that annihilates the commutator ideal\nand a general understanding of the commutator ideal. We believe that the\nkey to finding such a representation is to understand the action of module\nmaps on normalizers.\nRecall that an operator T \u2208 B(H) is said to normalize a masa D \u2286 B(H)\nif T \u2217 DT \u2286 D and T DT \u2217 \u2286 D. If T = V |T | is the polar decomposition, then\nT normalizes D if and only if |T | \u2208 D and V normalizes D.\n\n\fON THE RANGES OF BIMODULE PROJECTIONS\n\n11\n\nThe set of all normalizers of D is a selfadjoint semigroup (under composition) and it contains D. Therefore its norm-closed linear span is a unital\nC*-algebra, B say. If we decompose D into its totally atomic and continuous\nparts and let H = Ha \u2295 Hc be the corresponding orthogonal decomposition\nof the underlying Hilbert space, then any partial isometry that normalizes\nD must leave each of these subspaces invariant. It follows that B has at\nmost one nontrivial invariant projection, corresponding to this decomposition of D. For a B-projection must on the one hand commute with D hence\nmust belong to it; on the other hand if a projection in D is invariant under\nall normalizers, then it must be trivial or the projection onto one of these\nparts. Thus, if we assume that D is either atomic or continuous, then the\nw*-closure of B is B(H). We will show below that B is always proper.\nWhen D is atomic, then it is clear that B contains all the corresponding\nmatrix units and hence all of the compact operators.\nRemark 13. If D is continuous, does B contain compact operators? Since\nB is irreducible, it follows that if it contains some nonzero compact operator\nthen it must contain them all; for the set of all compact operators in B is then\na nonzero ideal of the irreducible algebra B, hence must itself be irreducible.\nProposition 14. Let \u03a6 \u2208 CBD = CBD (B(H)). For each normalizer T of\nD there exists DT \u2208 D such that\n\u03a6(T ) = DT T.\n\nIn fact DT depends only on the partially isometric factor V in the polar\ndecomposition T = V |T | of T .\nThus \u03a6(V f (|T |)) = DT V f (|T |) for any Borel function defined on \u03c3(|T |).\nProof. Since V itself normalizes the masa while |T | belongs to it, \u03a6(V |T |) =\n\u03a6(V )|T | by the module property of \u03a6. Hence it suffices to deal with a\nnormalizing partial isometry V .

If we assume\nthat we are in the situation of the last section, namely, that H = L2 (X, \u03bc),\nand that \u03a6 is a w*-continuous L\u221e -module map with symbol \u03c6(s, t), then\ngiven any function h on X that gives rise to a bounded composition operator\nCh on H, it is easy to see that \u03a6(Ch ) = Mk Ch , where k(s) = \u03c6(s, h(s)) a.e.\nThis follows from the easily verified fact that Mf Ch Mg = Mk Ch where\nk(s) = f (s)g(h(s)) a.e. and that \u03a6 can be represented as a sum of such\nelementary operators.\nThus, the function k tells us the value of the symbol restricted to the\ngraph of h.\nBy the above result, even in the case that \u03a6 is not w*-continuous, we see\nthat for each bounded composition operator it is still true that \u03a6(Ch ) =\nMk Ch for some function k and the problem becomes, whether or not we can\nconstruct a symbol \u03c6(s, t) such that k(s) = \u03c6(s, h(s)) holds for every h that\ngives rise to a bounded composition operator.\nFor the following results, the reader should keep in mind that it is quite\nlikely that B = B + K.\nProposition 15. Let B \u2286 B(H) be the C*-algebra generated by the normalizers of D and let K denote the ideal of compact operators. Then completely\nbounded D-bimodule maps leave B, K and B + K invariant and the algebra\nobtained by restricting the D-bimodule maps to any of these subspaces is\ncommutative.\nProof. The fact that B is left invariant by every D-bimodule map follows\nfrom Proposition 14. Let \u03a61 , \u03a62 \u2208 CBD (B(H)). If T \u2208 B(H) is a normalizer\nof D, by Proposition 14 there exist D1 , D2 \u2208 D s.t.\n\u03a61 (T ) = D1 T,\n\n\u03a62 (T ) = D2 T.\n\nSince D is abelian, it follows that\n\n\u03a61 (\u03a62 (T )) = \u03a61 (D2 T ) = D2 \u03a61 (T ) = D2 D1 T\n= D1 \u03a62 (T ) = \u03a62 (D1 T ) = \u03a62 (\u03a61 (T )).\n\nThus the commutator \u03a61 \u25e6 \u03a62 \u2212 \u03a62 \u25e6 \u03a61 vanishes on normalizers; hence it\nvanishes on B by linearity and continuity.\nHence, the algebra obtained by restricting D-bimodule maps to B is commutative.\nProposition 6 shows that every normal bimodule map leaves K invariant.\nIf we decompose an arbitrary bimodule map into its normal and singular\npart, then the singular part annihilates K and so also leaves it invariant.\nThus, K is left invariant by every D-bimodule map and the algebra obtained\nby restricting D-bimodule maps to K is exactly N CBD (B(H)).\nThe result for B + K follows from the first two parts.\n\u0003\nCorollary 16. The restriction maps\nR1 : CBD (B(H)) \u2192 CBD (B) : \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6|B\n\n\fON THE RANGES OF BIMODULE PROJECTIONS\n\n13\n\nand\nR2 : CBD (B(H)) \u2192 CBD (B + K) : \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6|B+K\nare onto, quotient maps that vanish on the commutator ideal of CBD (B(H)).\nProof. The fact that R1 vanishes on commutators is clear. By Wittstock's\nextension theorem for completely bounded bimodule maps [W], every map\nin CBD (B) has an extension to a map of the same completely bounded norm\nin CBD (B(H)). The fact that an extension exists means that R1 is onto, and\nthe fact that the (cb) norm remains the same means that R1 is a (complete)\nquotient map.\nThe proof for B + K is identical.\n\u0003\nConjecture. We conjecture that the kernels of R1 and of R2 are both equal\nto the (closed) commutator ideal.\nThe above result also provides some insight into the structure of B.\nCorollary 17. When D is not totally atomic, the C*-algebras B and B + K\nare proper (w*-dense) subalgebras of B(H).\nProof. If B + K were equal to B(H) then all D-bimodule maps would commute. But this is not the case when D is not totally atomic by [HW]. Hence\nB is also proper in this case.\n\u0003\nThe fact that the set of D-bimodule maps is non-commutative when D\nis not totally atomic can also be seen directly. For example, if \u03a61 , \u03a62 are\ntwo (norm-continuous) distinct projections onto the masa itself, then their\ncommutator is their difference. To see that two such distinct projections\nexist it suffices, by splitting D into its atomic and continuous part, to assume\nD \u2243 L\u221e [0, 1] (see for example [Tak], Theorem III.1.22). For this case two\ndistinct projections onto D can be found for example in [Dav], Algebras, 8.9\nand 8.10.\nThe above proof does not apply to the totally atomic case, since in this\ncase the D-bimodule maps do commute. Moreover, as remarked above, B\ncontains all compacts. However, another argument shows that B is still a\nproper subalgebra of B(H). We argue for the case that D = l\u221e .\nIn this case, we have that B \u2286 B(l2 ) is the C*-algebra generated by the\ndiagonal D = l\u221e and its normalizers. It is convenient to label the basis of l2\nas e0 , e1 , . . .. For each A = [ai,j ] \u2208 B(l2 ), we denote by an (n P\n\u2208 Z) its n-th\n\u221e\ndiagonal, i.e. an = (ai,j )i\u2212j=n \u2208 l , so that formally A = n\u2208Z Man Sn\nwhere Ma \u2208 B(l2 ) is the operator of multiplication by a \u2208 l\u221e and we set\nSn = S n for n \u2265 0 and Sn = (S \u2217 )\u2212n for n \u2264 0, where S is the unilateral\nshift.\nLemma 18. Let mP: l\u221e \u2192 C be a Banach limit, i.e. a translation invariant state. If A = |n|\u2264N Man Sn has finitely many nonzero diagonals, we\nP\nset \u03a8o (A) =\n|n|\u2264N m(an )Sn . Then \u03a8o extends to a completely positive\nprojection \u03a8 : B(l2 ) \u2192 B(l2 ) onto the Toeplitz operators.\n\n\f14\n\nA. KATAVOLOS AND V. I. PAULSEN\n\nProof. For A \u2208 B(H), consider the sesquilinear form\n\nH \u00d7 H \u2192 C : (x, y) \u2192 m((hAS n x, S n yi)n\u2208N ).\n\nSince\n|m((hAS n x, S n yi)n\u2208N )| \u2264 kmk sup |hAS n x, S n yi| \u2264 kAkkxkkyk,\nn\u2208N\n\n(because kmk = 1 and kS n k = 1) it is clear that this form is bounded, so\nthere exists a unique \u03a8(A) \u2208 B(H) such that\nh\u03a8(A)x, yi = m((hAS n x, S n yi)n\u2208N ).\n\nNote that the k-th diagonal of A is the sequence ak = (hAek+j , ej i)j\u2208N .\nNow for all i, k \u2208 N, the sequence (hAek+i+n , ei+n i)n\u2208N is a translate of the\nsequence ak , and so they have the same mean. Thus\nh\u03a8(A)ek+i , ei i = m((hAS n ek+i , S n ei i)n ) = m((hAen+k+i , en+i i)n ) = m(ak )\nhence the k-th diagonal of \u03a8(A) is the constant sequence (m(ak ), m(ak ), . . .).\nTherefore \u03a8 extends \u03a8o .\nIt is clear that \u03a8 is a linear projection onto the set of Toeplitz operators.\nFinally, \u03a8 is k-positive for all k \u2208 N. Indeed if [Aij ] \u2208 Mk (B(H)) is positive\nand x = (xi ) \u2208 Hk , we have\nX\nX\nm((hAij S n xj , S n xi i)n )\nh\u03a8(Aij )xj , xi i =\nh[\u03a8(Aij )]x, xi =\nij\n\nij\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\uf8eb\n\u0010\u0010\n\u0011 \u0011\nX\n\u22650\n= m \uf8ed\uf8ed hAij S n xj , S n xi i\uf8f8 \uf8f8 = m h[Aij ]S\u0303 n x, S\u0303 n xi\nij\n\nn\n\nn\n\n(where S\u0303 n x = (S n x1 , S n x2 , . . . , S n xk )).\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 19. Let B and \u03a8 be as above. The image \u03a8(B) contains only\nToeplitz operators with continuous symbol; hence B cannot be all of B(l2 ).\nProof. Given a partially isometric normalizer V of D let (vn ) be its sequence\nof diagonals. Note thatPsince V has at most one 1 per row and column the\n(coordinatewise) sum n\u2208Z vn is dominated by the vector (2, 2, . . .) \u2208 l\u221e .\nIt follows that for each N \u2208 N,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\n0\u2264\nm(vn ) = m \uf8ed\nvn \uf8f8 \u2264 m((2, 2, . . .)) = 2\n|n|\u2264N\n\n|n|\u2264N\n\nP \u02c6\n|f (n)| \u2264 2\nand so 0 \u2264 n\u2208Z m(vn ) \u2264 2. It follows that \u03a8(V ) = Tf where\nand so f is continuous (its Fourier series converges absolutely).\nConsequently for any diagonal operator D of norm M say, the sum of\nthe absolute values of the diagonals of DVPwill be dominated by the vector\n(2M, 2M, . . .) and so \u03a8(DV ) = Tf where n |f\u02c6(n)| \u2264 2M . Hence f will be\nP\n\n\fON THE RANGES OF BIMODULE PROJECTIONS\n\n15\n\na continuous function on the circle. By linearity and continuity of \u03a8, the\nresult follows.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[Arv] W.B.
