Precision timing of millisecond\npulsars within a pulsar timing array (PTA) provides a\nunique opportunity to get the very first low-frequency\nGW detection. GWs affect the propagation of radio\nsignals from the pulsar to the receiver on Earth, leaving a characteristic fingerprint in the time of arrival of\nthe radio pulses [e.g., 1, 2]. This technique is particularly sensitive in the 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22127 Hz window, where\ngenuinely supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs,\n108 \u2212 109 M ) at low redshift (z < 2) will dominate the\nsignal (Sesana et al. 2009). The Parkes Pulsar Timing\nArray [PPTA, 3], the European Pulsar Timing Array\n[EPTA, 4] and the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves [NANOGrav, 5], joining together in the International Pulsar Timing Array\n[IPTA, 6], are already collecting data and improving\ntheir sensitivity in the frequency range of \u223c 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22126\nHz. In the coming years, the Chinese five hundred meter\naperture spherical telescope [FAST, 7] and the planned\nSquare Kilometer Array [SKA, 8] will provide a major\nleap in sensitivity.\nThe signal expected from a cosmological population of\ninspiralling SMBHBs consists of a superposition of quasimonochromatic waves, similar to the white dwarf-white\ndwarf foreground [e.g., 9] in the mHz window relevant\nto space based interferometry. Such signal can be divided into two distinct contributions: (i) a stochastic\nbackground generated by the incoherent superposition\nof radiation from the whole SMBHB population [10\u2013\n12] and (ii) individually resolvable, deterministic signals\nproduced by single sources that are sufficiently massive\nand/or close so that the gravitational signal stands above\nthe root-mean-square (rms) level of the background [13].\nAccordingly, signal recovery and data analysis investigations have been developed in the limiting cases of either\nan isotropic stochastic background described by a powerlaw spectrum [14\u201318], or of a single GW source [19\u201323].\nThe actual expected signal, however, is far from being\nisotropically distributed in the sky, with just few sources\ndominating the power at each frequency [12, 24]. The\nGW signal generated by an astrophysically motivated\nSMBHB population is neither isotropic and stochastic,\nnor dominated by a single source. It is therefore important to fully characterize such signal, and to assess how\nmuch of the information enclosed in it can be recovered.\nIt is, in fact, not clear a priori how such inhomogeneous\ncombination of multiple sources emitting in the same frequency bin will appear in the time residuals: whether\nthey will look almost isotropic over the sky, or they will\n\nsuperpose and appear as a single one, or as few bright\nspots in the sky.\nThis paper is a proof of concept of how the spatial\ninformation enclosed in a PTA can be exploited to disentangle a superposition of signals coming from different\ndirections in the sky. We utilize a maximum-likelihood\nbased algorithm designed to identify the sky origin and\nrelative strengths of a collection of incoherently superposed monochromatic signals. We test the algorithm performances on different noiseless datasets, and then we apply it to noisy datasets. In agreement with simple counting arguments and with previous analytical results [25]\nwe find that P/3 sources can be resolved and localized in\nthe sky by an array of P pulsars. If the number of sources\nis more than P/3 we might identify the presence of extra\nsources with poor localization precision, and we will not\nbe able to estimate their parameters. When few sources\nare present, the maximum likelihood estimator allows to\ninfer the correct number of contributing sources, and the\nalgorithm locates them in the sky with good accuracy.\nThe same is true when noise is added to the data. Also\nin a situation of source SNR\u2248 10, the algorithm is able\nto correctly disentangle signals and to locate the sources\nin the sky.\nThis pilot study demonstrates the potential of PTAs\nof resolving and locating in the sky a sizable number of\nsources. We stress that we do not implement any proper\nsearch algorithm when looking for solutions that maximize the likelihood estimator, and we do not draw sources\nfrom expected astrophysical SMBHB populations. We\nplan to consider these aspects of the problem in the future, to test our method under more realistic assumptions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We spell out the objectives and the assumptions of our data analysis method\nin Section II. The model used for the sources and a detailed mathematical description of the detection strategy\ncan be found in Section III. We discuss source identification and resolvability in Section IV and test our method\nagainst blind datasets in Section V. We summarize and\ndiscuss future research directions in Section VI.\nII.\n\nOBJECTIVES AND BASIC ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe main aim of this paper is to provide a proof of\nconcept of the potential of PTAs to resolve individual\ncontributions to a GW signal formed by the incoherent\nsuperposition of several monochromatic sources. We are\nprimarily interested here in disentangling the source contribution to the signal and in estimating their sky location. As we aim at a proof of concept, we make a set of\nsimplifying assumptions:\n1. only GW sources contribute to the timing residuals, i.e., we test our method on noiseless data. We\nwill relax this assumption in the last Section, testing the effectiveness of our technique on noisy synthetic data. When included, noise is modelled as\n\n\f3\n\nwhite and Gaussian, with equal magnitude in all\nthe pulsars forming the array;\n2. we only consider few GW sources contributing to\nthe data streams. We will consider more realistic\nsource populations where few bright sources might\ndominate over a large distribution of weaker ones\nin future investigations;\n3. we look at signals in a particular 'frequency bin', i.e,\nwe do not perform any frequency search. Throughout the paper we deal with monochromatic signals\nat f = 14 nHz (f = 20 nHz for the blind challenges). We assume that the frequency is known.\nWe intend to include frequency scanning in the\nanalysis in forthcoming studies;\n4. when modelling the GW signal, we use the leading\nquadrupole approximation for non-spinning binaries in quasi-circular orbit, as we will describe in\nthe details in Section III;\n5. we consider the \"Earth\" term only in the pulsar response, excluding the \"pulsar\" term. GW sources\naligned along the Earth-pulsar line of sight do not\ncontribute to the timing residuals if the full response is considered (Earth+pulsar terms), however excluding the \"pulsar\" term makes the response infinite in this case. We therefore exclude\nGW sources within 5 degrees of any pulsar sky location. We will give more details on the \"pulsar\"\nand the \"Earth\" terms in Section III;\n6. the sky location of the pulsars in the array is drawn\nfrom a uniform distribution on the sphere;\n7. we assume 10 years of uninterrupted equallysampled (once every two weeks) observations of\neach pulsar in the array;\n8. we do not implement any proper search algorithm\nin maximizing the likelihood. The sky maps and\nmaximum likelihood estimates are computed by\nrandomly (uniformly on the sphere) drawing points\nin the sky. We will optimize the search algorithm\nin future investigations.\nEach residual series is monochromatic in our set up,\nand therefore contains two measurable quantities: the\namplitude and the initial phase. On the other hand, in\nthe approximation of circular non evolving sources, the\nGW signal is described by six parameters: overall amplitude A, inclination \u03b9, initial orbital phase \u03a60 , polarization angle \u03c8, sky location angles {\u03c6, \u03b8}. The simple\ncounting of the measurable quantities (two per pulsar)\nand of the number of unknowns (six per GW source)\nsuggests that we will need P = 3 \u00d7 N 1 pulsars to detect\n\n1\n\nThroughout the paper we will denote with P the number of pulsars in the array and with N the number of sources contributing\n\nand to estimate parameters of N GW sources. In general\nthis counting is correct if one knows the exact number of\nsignals in the data and wants to estimate parameters of\nall these signals. In a real situation the exact number of\nGW signals is unknown. In addition the strength of different GW sources could vary significantly, with a large\nfraction of weak sources forming an anisotropic (in the\nsky) background for the brighter ones.\nIII.\n\nGW SOURCE MODEL AND DETECTION\nSTRATEGY\n\nThe analysis is built around the maximum likelihood\nestimator of the source parameters. We notice that the\nlikelihood could be maximized analytically over some\n(what are called extrinsic) parameters characterizing the\nGW source, in a way similar to the F -statistic [26]. We\ntherefore need to write the signal in a mathematical form\nsuitable to such analytical maximization.\nA.\n\nGravitational wave model\n\nWe consider monochromatic GW sources assuming\nthat the orbital frequency does not change appreciably over the observation period [see, e.g., 20] which we\ntook to be 10 years. The signal is characterized by\nthe six parameters introduced in the previous Section\n{A, \u03b9, \u03a60 , \u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b8}, plus the GW frequency f , which we\nassume to be known here. Those parameters describe\nthe GW signal from a widely separated SMBHB in quasicircular orbit. We neglect all modulations due to spinorbital coupling [27], so effectively we consider two nonspinning SMBHs. We refer the reader for more detailed\ndiscussion on the waveforms and on the computing the\ntiming residuals to [20]. The waveform in the radiative\nframe reads\n\u00d7\nhij = \u000f+\nij h+ + \u000fij h\u00d7 ,\n\n\u000f+\nij\n\n= pi pj \u2212 qi qj ,\n\n\u000f\u00d7\nij\n\n(1)\n= pi qj + pj qi ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p\u0302, q\u0302 is the polarization basis. The polarization\nbasis associated to the Earth (or to the Solar system\nbarycenter) is\n\u00fb = {cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6, \u2212 sin \u03b8},\nv\u0302 = {sin \u03c6, \u2212 cos \u03c6, 0},\np\u0302 = \u00fb cos \u03c8 \u2212 v\u0302 sin \u03c8, q\u0302 = v\u0302 cos \u03c8 + \u00fb sin \u03c8.\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nThe rotation in the last line defines the polarization angle\n\u03c8. The components of the GW signal are\nh+ = A(1 + cos2 \u03b9) cos(\u03a6(t) + \u03a60 )\nh\u00d7 = \u22122A cos \u03b9 sin(\u03a6(t) + \u03a60 )\n\nto the signal.\n\n(6)\n\n\f4\n\nwhere we have written explicitly the initial GW phase,\nand\n\nNote that Fc\u03b1 and Fs\u03b1 depend only on the sky locations of\nthe pulsar {\u03b3\u03b1 , \u03c7\u03b1 } and of the GW source {\u03c6, \u03b8}. Using\nthese expressions we can rewrite the residuals as\n\n5/3\n\nA=2\n\nMc\n(\u03c0f )2/3 .\nDL\n\n(7)\nr\u03b1E (t) =\n\n3/5\n3/5\nIn the last equation Mc = M1 M2 /(M1 + M2 )1/5 is\nthe chirp mass of the source, and DL is its luminosity\n\ndistance. The residuals in the arrival time of the radio pulses due to the propagation of the electromagnetic\nwaves in the field of the GW can be written as\nZ t\n\u03b4\u03bd 0 0\n(t )dt ,\n(8)\nr(t) =\n0 \u03bd\n\u03b4\u03bd\n1 n\u0302i n\u0302j\n\u2206hij ,\n(9)\n=\n\u03bd\n2 1 + n\u0302 * k\u0302\nwhere n\u0302 denotes the position of the pulsar on the sky,\nand k\u0302 is the direction of the GW propagation.

We introduce the\ninner product:\nZ To\nTo\n2\n< x|h >\u2261\n(x||h), (x||h) \u2261\nx(t)h(t)dt,\n(19)\nS(f )\nTo 0\nwhere To is the observation timespan and S(f ) is the\ntwo-sided noise spectral density.\nConsider now a dataset x\u03b1 ; the log-likelihood that this\ndataset contains a GW signal r\u03b1 (t; ~\u03bb) 2 , where ~\u03bb is a\nvector of GW parameters describing the signal, is\nlog \u039b\u03b1 \u223c< x\u03b1 |r\u03b1 > \u2212\n\n1\n1\n< r\u03b1 |r\u03b1 >\u223c (x\u03b1 ||r\u03b1 ) \u2212 (r\u03b1 ||r\n(20)\n\u03b1 ).\n2\n2\n\nSince we consider monochromatic sources and noise-less\ndata, S(f ) is just a scaling constant in our calculations;\nin the following, we neglect numerical coefficients, and\nwe compute scaled log-likelihoods. Let us now assume\nwe have a collection of datasets x\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, ..., P , corresponding to observations of P -pulsars, and let us infer\nthat a single GW is present in the datasets. The total\nlog-likelihood evaluated on the P datasets is simply the\nsum of the individual log-likelihoods, and substituting r\u03b1\n\n2\n\nHereafter we omit the superscript \"E\", implicitly assuming that\nwe are considering the Earth-term only.\n\n\f5\n\ngiven in equation (17) into equation (20), can be written\nas:\nP\nX\n\nlog(\u039b) =\n\nlog(\u039b\u03b1 )\n\n\u03b1=1\n4\nX\n\n\u223c\n\n4\n\na(j) Xj \u2212\n\nj=1\n\n4\n\n1 XX\na(j) a(k) Mjk , (21)\n2 j=1\nk=1\n\nwhere\nXj \u2261\n\nP\nX\n\n(x\u03b1 ||h\u03b1\n(j) ),\n\nMjk \u2261\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nP\nX\n\n\u03b1\n(h\u03b1\n(j) ||h(k) ) (22)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nAs in the F -statistics case, we can maximize the loglikelihood over the extrinsic parameters a(j) :\n\u2202 log(\u039b)\n= 0,\n\u2202a(j)\n\n\u22121\n\u2192 a(k) = Mkj\nXj ,\n\n(23)\n\n1\n\u22121\nXk Mjk\nXj\n2\n\n(24)\n\n{log(\u039b)}max{a(j) } =\n\nwhere the sum over the repeated indices j, k = 1, ..., 4 is\nassumed. Note that such maximization absorbs the four\nparameters A, \u03b9, \u03c8 and \u03a60 ; the maximized log-likelihood\nhas therefore a form similar to the F -statistic and (for\na fixed frequency) is function of the sky location {\u03c6, \u03b8}\nof the GW source only. From now on, when we talk\nabout log-likelihood, we mean log-likelihood maximized\nover a(j) according to equations (23) and (24), and for\nan individual GW source is a function of two parameters\nonly. The M -matrix is block-diagonal, and is given by\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n(Fc\u03b1 )2 Fc\u03b1 F\u03b1s\nX \uf8ec F \u03b1 F \u03b1 (F \u03b1 )2\n0\n0 \uf8f7\ns\n.

Now the\ncoefficients a(j) become a 4 \u00d7 N array, Xj is also a 4 \u00d7 N\narray, while the M -matrix is now a 4N \u00d7 4N , 2-D matrix\nMjk =\n\nP\nX\n\n\u03b1\n(h\u03b1\n(j) ||h(k) ).\n\n(26)\n\nequation (23) provides an estimate of the four parameters characterizing the waveform. The relative contribution of each source to the maximum likelihood solution\nnormalized to the strongest source can therefore be written as\nqP\n4\nn 2\nj=1 (a(j) )\n\u0011\n\u0010qP\nCn = log(\u039b)\n(27)\n4\nm 2\nmaxm\nj=1 (a(j) )\nwhere n, m = 1, ..., N . In the above expression maxm\nidentifies the brightest source in the dataset, and the\nsums are over the four coefficients of each n source. Note\nthat Cn is a function of the source inclinationqand of the\noverall GW amplitude, and is proportional to h2+ + h2\u00d7 ,\nas introduced in equation (6). Note that in this definition, if we have identical GW sources but at different sky\nlocations, then all the individual Cn are the same and\nare equal to the total likelihood.\nIn the following sections we will perform a search of\nthe GW source sky locations by maximizing the loglikelihood given by equation (21). We will compute the\nlog-likelihood assuming a variable number of GW sources\ncontributing to the residuals, to check whether our analysis allows us to infer the correct number of sources present\nin the dataset. As a result the log-likelihood parameter\nspace is generally a function of 2 \u00d7 N parameters, corresponding to the sky locations of the N GW sources.\nIn plotting multi-source sky maps we will usually show\nregions of the parameter space which are within 10 % of\nthe maximum likelihood, and we will call them ambiguity or error regions. Actual ambiguity regions depend on\nthe SNR of the GW signals, and are therefore meaningless in the noise-less case, nevertheless we think that the\nintroduced error regions are still useful to indicate the\ndegeneracies/ambiguities in the parameter space.\nIV.\n\nTESTING THE ALGORITHM\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIn this section we apply the theory outlined above to\nsome test cases to assess its effectiveness in resolving individual sources (and dependence on the number of sources\nand on the number of pulsars in the array used for detection). We consider here the limit of few GW sources\npresent in the dataset; extension of the analysis to a realistic population of sources is deferred to future investigations.\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n(where indices j, k run over 1, ..., 4N ) and it takes into\naccount for correlations between the different GW signals.\nWhen considering a multi-source model we can also estimate the relative contribution of each individual source\nto the overall likelihood estimator. For each source the\nanalytical maximization of the likelihood according to\n\nA.\n\nMinimum requirements for source localization\n\nWe first test the statement that 3N pulsars are required to resolve N GW sources. We start by considering one GW source and one pulsar and we add pulsars\nand sources one by one to see how the likelihood pattern\ndescribing the source sky location changes. We start by\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 1. Log-likelihood sky map for the sky position of the GW\nsource (black star), in a detection with three pulsars (green\ncircles). Note that only relative values of the log-likelihood\nare meaningful. The best estimate for the source position is\n{4.27, 0.78}, whereas the true one is {4.26, 0.78}.\n\ninjecting a first source at a location {4.26, 0.78}, then we\nadd a second source at a location {1.50, 1.52}. Pulsars\nare placed randomly in the sky.\n\u2022 One GW signal and one pulsar. In this case we\nmight only say whether the GW signal is present or\nnot. Our method cannot estimate the parameters\nof the source. Mathematically this correspond to a\nsingular (determinant equal to zero) M -matrix.\n\u2022 One GW signals and two pulsars. With two pulsars we can estimate four parameters but we cannot get any information about the sky position:\n\u039b(\u03c6, \u03b8) = const, with the exact value depending on\nthe relative position of the pulsars and the source.\n\u2022 One GW signal and three pulsars. Finally, we have\nenough measurable quantities to estimate the position of the source on the sky. The accuracy depends on the relative position of the pulsars and\nthe source. In figure 1 we give an example of the\nlog-likelihood map of the source sky position. The\nshape and area of the likelihood peak strongly depend on the relative position of the source and the\npulsars. The presence of the noise will make the\npicture worse by (possibly) promoting false local\nmaxima. Conversely, adding more pulsars significantly improves the accuracy of the localization.\n\u2022 Two GW signals and three pulsars. We do not have\nenough measured quantities to determine the parameters of both GW sources; again, the M -matrix\nis degenerate. However we can compute the likelihood map assuming that there is only one GW\n\nFIG. 2. Top panel: five pulsars (green circles) and two\nsources (black stars): the source log-likelihood map is constructed assuming a one source model, whereas there are two\nsources in the dataset. The best source position estimate is\n{4.33, 0.89}; the true positions of the sources are {1.50, 1.52}\nand {4.26, 0.78}. Bottom panel: log-likelihood map, assuming\na single GW source, constructed after the removal of the best\nestimate shown in the top panel. Although there are hints\nof the presence of a second source, its inferred sky location\ndoes not match the actual position of the second GW source\nat {1.50, 1.52}.\n\nsource contributing to the measured timing residuals. The result depends on the strength of the\nGW signals (both on the intrinsic strength and\non the pulsar response function, i.e., on the relative source-pulsar sky location). We tested the\nmost degenerate case: we took two identical GW\nsources, and we placed them at different sky locations ({4.26, 0.78}, {1.50, 1.52}). Not surprisingly,\nbeing the signal a superposition of two monochromatic plane waves, the two sources show up like a\nsingle one at a midway sky location. Adding a forth\npulsar does not significantly improve the situation.\n\u2022 Two GW signals and five pulsars. Still we do not\nhave enough measured quantities (10) to measure\nall the source parameters (12). However, in a single GW source model, we start to see evidence of\ntwo likelihood maxima for the source sky location,\na strong indication that there is more than one\nsource. As shown in the upper panel of figure 2,\n\n\f7\n\n3\n\nFIG. 3. Same as the top panel of figure 2, but now using six pulsars for the detection. The log-likelihood map\nclearly shows two extended maxima around the true location\nof the sources. The best single source sky location estimate\nis {4.35, 0.94}, the true positions are the same as in figure 2.\n\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n1\n\nwe now resolve one source and we have a large local\nmaximum next to the second one. The result varies\nwith the relative source-pulsar position, but for\nfixed (chosen above) positions of the GW sources\nwe usually resolve one source or the other. In addition we have computed the log-likelihood map\nassuming two GW sources in the data. Since we\nstill do not have enough measurements to estimate\nall the parameters, the likelihood forms a complicated pattern in the sky reflecting this degeneracy.\nHowever the value of the log-likelihood for the twosource model is higher (by about 13%) than the single source model, strongly favoring the presence of\ntwo signals in the data. To further check what can\nbe possibly done in this situation, we have tried to\ntake the best estimate obtained by the single-source\nmodel, subtract it from the dataset and re-analyze\nit again searching for the second GW source (using again a single-source model). Unfortunately\nthe procedure does not work well. The maximum likelihood estimators of the amplitude parameters of the first source have large errors (estimated\nvalues are a(i) = {6.15, \u22121.71, \u22125.44, \u22122.57} \u00d7\n10\u221210 instead of the correct values: atrue\n=\n(i)\n\u221210\n{4.08, \u22122.54, \u22122.53, \u22124.09} \u00d7 10 ): when subtracting it, we are effectively partially removing the\nsecond GW source. The result after the removal is\nshown in the lower panel of figure 2. There is an\nindication of a second GW signal but it is in a completely wrong location. We can conclude that in an\narray of five pulsars there is enough information to\nidentify the presence of two sources, but it is impossible to correctly localize both of them in the\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c6\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 4. Top panel: same as in figure 2, but now using\n30 pulsars for the detection. The best single source position estimate is now shifted to the other source, and the inferred location is {1.48, 1.63}, whereas the true position is\n{1.50, 1.52}. Bottom panel: log-likelihood map assuming that\nthere are two GW sources (blue diamonds), with measurements from 30 pulsars (green circles). We have selected all\nthe pairs of points which are within 10% of the maximum\nlikelihood estimate. The best source sky location estimates\nare {1.48, 1.55}, {4.31, 0.78}, whereas the true positions are\n{1.50, 1.52}, {4.26, 0.78}.\n\nsky.\n\u2022 Two GW signals and six pulsars. Finally we have\nenough pulsars to estimate all the GW parameters, however the randomly chosen sixth pulsar is\nquite close to one of the previous five, so some\nlevel of degeneracy remains. The log-likelihood\ncontour plot for the single source model shown in\nfigure 3 clearly has two maxima centered at the\ntrue location of the sources. We also successfully\ntested a two source model: the pair of points in the\nsky which returned the highest log-likelihood were\n{1.48, 1.55}, {4.31, 0.78}, close to the true values.\n\u2022 Two GW signals and thirty pulsars. By adding pulsars to the array, uncertainty regions shrink and\nsecondary maxima disappear. Here is an example\nof what we would see with data from 30 pulsars.\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 5. Detection of a cluster of sources (black stars in each\nplot). The log-likelihood sky map for a single source model\nis shown, assuming detection with 6 (top) and 100 (bottom)\npulsars (green circles). The color coding corresponds to the\n(scaled) log-likelihood value.\n\nThe log-likelihood contour plot for the single source\nmodel shown in the top panel of figure 4 nails down\nthe true location of the sources. We plot the results of a two source model in the lower panel of\nfigure 4. In this case, the likelihood is a function of\nfour parameters (the angles defining the sky location of the two sources) and a visual representation\nis not straightforward. We randomly choose pair of\npoints in the sky and computed the log-likelihood.\nIn the figure we plot all the pair of points which\nare within 10% of the maximum likelihood estimate\n(note that a 10% drop in the log-likelihood roughly\ncorresponds to the uncertainty region of a pair of\nsources with combined SNR= 10).\n\nB.\n\nResolving a cluster of GW sources\n\nIn the previous subsection we looked at the detection\nand sky location of one or two GW sources with variable\n\nnumber of pulsars. We have chosen on purpose widely\nseparated sources. We consider now a small group (cluster) of GW sources located close to each other in the sky.\nThe idea is to check whether we can still infer the number of sources in the cluster and resolve them individually. We consider sources of equal intrinsic strength. We\nstart with computing the log-likelihood sky map assuming a single GW source and incrementing the number of\npulsars from 6 to 100. Even with 100 pulsars the cluster\nlooks like a single maximum in the likelihood extending\nover the whole cluster. The size of this maximum shrinks\nas we include more and more pulsars, but we do not see\nthe development of multiple maxima corresponding to\nthe true locations of the sources. We show likelihood\ncontour plots in figure 5 for 6 and 100 pulsars in the\narray.\nWe then tried multiple GW source models. We\nstarted with 6 pulsars; in this case we cannot try\nmodels with more than two GW sources. The best\nguess for a two-source model is {4.60, 0.90}; {4.22, 0.96},\nto be compared to the true positions of the sources:\n{4.26, 0.78}; {4.37, 0.98}; {4.66, 0.88}; {4.82, 1.01}.\nIncreasing the number of pulsars to 12, we can test\nmodels with up to 4 sources.\nUnfortunately the\nresult is a significant increase in the ambiguity\narea with poor source localization.\nFor example, the best guess with a three source model is\n{4.84, 2.03, 0.0004}; {4.28, 0.88, 0.123}; {4.71, 0.94, 0.161}.\nThe third number in each parenthesis is the estimate\nof the relative contribution of the source to the loglikelihood, i.e., Cn as defined by equation (27). The\nfirst source in the solution contributes negligibly to the\nresult: the best solution is essentially still a two-source\nmodel.\nThe result improves by increasing the number of pulsars and running models with 2-, 3- and 4-sources. The\nbest guess with 100 pulsars is close to the true positions\nof the GW sources, and all four points give a significant contribution to the likelihood: {4.20, 0.81, 0.67};\n{4.41, 0.92, 1.19}; {4.63, 0.89, 1.2281}; {4.90, 1.04, 0.65}.\nHowever the maximum likelihoods of the best 1-, 2-, 3and 4-source solutions are very similar: 1.2144, 1.2279,\n1.2281, 1.22815 (to be compared to a true likelihood of\n1.22818). This means that we might not be able to differentiate between those models in practice (in presence\nof noise).\n\nC.\n\nDetermining the number of GW sources\n\nWe consider now a signal generated by the superposition of five sources with known sky location and relative\nstrength. We test two cases: in the first case, all sources\nhave equal strength; in the second one, we take the relative source strengths of the five brightest sources found\nin a realization of the cosmic SMBHB population from\n[24]. Sources are placed randomly in the sky, and their\n\n\f9\n\nsignal, the algorithm is capable of unambiguously identifying the number of sources present in the data.\n\nFIG. 6. Log-likelihood sky map for the single-source model\nin the case of five unequal GW sources detected with an array of 50 pulsars. The true position of the five GW sources\nis shown as black circles, with relative size corresponding to\ntheir relative strength. Pulsars are shown as green dots.\n\nlocation is the same for both cases.\nAs a first test, we estimate the likelihood function of\na single-source model as a function of the number P of\npulsars in the array. Results are similar in the two cases.\nIn the equal strength case, when P is small, we observe\na single maximum resulting from the combination of the\nfive sources. When P \u2248 30, we detect two local maxima corresponding to the true location of two of the GW\nsources, and when P \u2248 50, the local maxima correctly\nrecover three sources. A similar situation occurs in the\nunequal case, with the difference that now, when P is\nsmall, the single maximum corresponds to the actual position of the brightest source. Again, increasing P up to\n50, we observe three maxima, corresponding to the three\nbrightest sources. The log-likelihood sky map for P = 50\nin the unequal case is shown in figure 6.\nUsing 50 pulsars we then tried 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8source models. We should emphasize here that our maximum likelihood search is far from being optimal, so we\nhad to do quite extended searches for models with more\nthan 4 GW sources. We plan to apply proper search algorithms to this problem in future work. In figure 7 we\nshow the maximum recovered log-likelihood as a function of the number of GW sources included in the model\nfor the two examined cases. In the equal case, we see\na steady increase of the maximum likelihood up to five\nsources, beyond which the curve suddenly flattens out.\nA similar behaviour is seen in the unequal case, with the\ndifference that now the maximum likelihood growth for\n3-to-5 source models is much shallower than before. This\nis simply due to the unequal strength of the sources. Also\nin this case, the likelihood flattens out if more than five\nsources are included. We can therefore safely say that,\nat least in the limit of few sources contributing to the\n\nIn figure 8 we try to give a sense of how the likelihood\nmap behaves for models with more than one source. As\nalready pointed out before, a visualization of the likelihood is not straightforward, since it is now function of\n2 \u00d7 N parameters, and is not easily represented in a 2-D\nplot. Here we consider the equal strength case, and we\nshow the points giving a contribution Cn within 10% of\nmaximum likelihood value. In the 2-source model (upper\nleft panel) we already clearly see three clusters around the\ntrue location of three of the injected sources. The situation does not significantly change adding a third source,\nbut clusters around all the five sources begin to appear\nin the 4-source model (lower left panel) and are clearly\nresolved in the 5-source model (lower right panel). If\nwe go beyond a 5-source model, the likelihood map becomes more and more diluted (increase of the ambiguity\nregions) without showing any significant new \"cluster of\npoints\", or any improvement of the maximum likelihood.\nNote that also in the 5-source model, the ambiguity areas\nare quite large, which would, for example, pose a serious\nproblem to a putative search for electromagnetic counterparts to the sources [28, 29]. However we have noticed\nthat the ambiguity regions around the bright sources in\nthe 2-source model search (see upper left panel) are notably smaller than the areas around the corresponding\nsources in the 5-source model search (lower right panel).\nWe want to take this into account while constructing a\nproper search algorithm, by restricting the ambiguity region in the five source search to that found in the 2-3\nsource model. This should allow us more accurate localization of the GW sources.\nAs a final step, we give the best recovered source parameters for each N -source model in table I. Notice that\nfor a noiseless dataset, in principle, for a 5-source model,\nthe best answer giving the maximum likelihood is the\ntrue one. However it might take quite a long time to\nconverge to that answer. What we show in the table is\nthe result of our (limited) search algorithm, which should\ngive some ideas about the abilities to find and locate maxima. The detection strategy performs well in both cases.\nAs N increases up to 5, we recover N sources almost at\nthe right sky location. And for N > 5, the additional\nsources always have a relative contribution to the likelihood which is an order of magnitude smaller than the\ntrue ones. Notice also that the recovered values of Cn ,\nrepresenting the relative contribution of the sources to\nthe signal, are very close to the injected relative source\nstrengths. In the future work we intend to apply advanced search algorithms [see, e.g., 30\u201333] developed and\nused for GW data analysis in present and future interferometric detectors.\n\n\f10\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.28\n\nlog(Likelihood)\n\nlog(Likelihood)\n\n0.18\n0.26\n0.24\n0.22\n\n0.16\n\n0.14\n\n0.2\n0.12\n\n0.18\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n6\n5\nnumber of GW sources\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\nnumber of GW sources\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFIG. 7.

For this exercise,\ndatasets were generated by A. Sesana, and searches were\nperformed by S. Babak without any previous knowledge\nof the content of the datasets, except for the fact that\nthere were less than 10 sources.\n\nNoiseless data\n\nIn the first round of blind searches, we used noiseless datasets. We used equally sampled (once every two\nweeks) time series for 50 pulsars located randomly in\nthe sky. Two datasets were analyzed, both of them\ncontaining six sources with unequal strengths at a frequency f = 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 Hz. The first search inferred 5 or 7\nsources (corresponding to maximum likelihoods of 0.131\nand 0.133, to be compared with 0.1345 which is the likelihood for the actual position of the 6 injected sources).\nIn the second blind search the best guesses were 5 or\n\n\f11\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.

Log-likelihood sky maps of the source sky positions\nfor an injection of 5 source with equal strength, detected with\nan array of 50 pulsars. From the top left to the bottom right,\npanels show the likelihood for a 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-source model.\nWe plot all the points which have Cn within 10% of the maximum likelihood for each model.\n\n6 sources with maximum likelihood of 0.0699 and 0.071\nrespectively (to be compared to 0.077 for the true injection). In the first dataset there were two close pairs of\nsources, while in the second one there was only one tight\npair. The presence of tight pairs makes the source recovery problematic, especially because we do not use any\noptimized search algorithm (note that in both cases, the\nmaximum estimated likelihood is quite smaller than the\ntrue one). Results are visualized in figure 9. Here, filled\nblack circles denote the true location of the GW sources,\nand coloured diamonds and squares correspond to points\nextracted by the best model solutions. The relative size\nof the symbols represent either the relative strength of\nthe sources, or the relative contribution to the likelihood\nof the recovered points. Isolated sources are clearly identified, and their inferred position is usually within few\ndegrees of the true one. Close pairs are more problematic, because sometimes the search algorithm recognize a\nsingle source, midway between the two. We expect these\nresults to improve in a optimized search.\n\nB.\n\nNoisy data\n\nWe finally tackled a more 'realistic' situation in which\nwhite noise was added to the data (note that the spectral properties of the noise is irrelevant here, since we\nperform a 'monochromatic' exercise). We considered two\nsituation representative of realistic scenarios that might\nbe realized in the near future:\n1. Hard search: 30 pulsars with equal rms noise of\n100ns, which is the nominal sensitivity goal of the\nIPTA collaboration [6];\n\nBoth datasets were again equally sampled once every two\nweeks over a timespan of 10 years, and few sources with\nunequal strength of the order of 50 \u2212 100ns (consistent\nwith the strongest sources predicted by state of the art\nSMBHB population models) were injected at a frequency\nf = 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 Hz. An example of 'easy' data stream is\nshown in figure 10. The signal is clearly visible by eye\nin the noisy data (middle panel). In the 'easy' search,\nSNRs in each single pulsars were in fact between 5 and\n30, with total SNR in the array of 162.33. In the 'hard'\ncase, SNRs in some individual pulsars were even < 1,\nwith a total SNR in the array of 23.65.\nResults for the 'easy' search are shown in the left panel\nof figure 11, where the four best solutions are plotted.\nAll the solutions inferred 5-to-7 sources, pinning down\nthe position of most of the injections within just a few\ndegrees. In particular, the seven-source solution showed\nwith red squares recovered correctly all the five sources\nwithin < 10 degrees of their true location, whereas the\ntwo additional sources inferred by the solution contribute\nmuch less (factor of two-to-three) to the likelihood of the\nsolution with respect to the other five. A good performance was expected in this case, since the SNR is so high\nthat we are approaching the noiseless limit.\nThe four best solutions to the 'hard' search are shown\nin the right panel of figure 11. Here we see a different situation: all the solutions correctly recover the two brightest\nsources within few degrees of their true location. However the weakest two are often missing or misidentified.\nFour-five source solutions are clearly preferred (higher\nmaximum likelihood), but the weakest sources are not\ncorrectly recovered. This is simply because their SNR in\nthe array ( \u223c 4.5 and \u223c 10.1) is both small in absolute\nterms, and relative to the brighter sources (SNR \u223c 13.7\nand \u223c 15.9). The noise contribution is rather significant\nin this case, as it creates additional (to the noiseless,\nintrinsic) ambiguity by promoting secondary likelihood\nmaxima. By inspecting individual datasets as the one\nshown in figure 10, we noticed that no more than 10-15\npulsars significantly contribute to the total SNR in the\narray, being the SNR in the others of order unity. This\nmeans that we effectively have barely enough pulsars to\nestimate all the parameters of the four sources, which\nmight also contribute to the difficulties of locating the\nweaker sources in the sky. We expect a proper search to\nimprove these results.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have investigated for the first time the possibility of exploiting the information enclosed in the spatial\ndistribution of a pulsar timing array to resolve gravita-\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 9. Results of the noiseless blind searches. Left panel: few points from the best 5-source (blue) and 7-source (yellow)\nsolutions for the first dataset. Right plot: best guesses from the 5-source model (blue) and from the 6-source model (yellow).\nThe relative size of the symbols indicates the relative contribution of each point to the combined likelihood. In both panels,\nthe injected sources are shown as filled circles, with relative size corresponding to their relative strength.\n\nwe need at least P = 3 \u00d7 N pulsars;\n\u2022 if P < 3 \u00d7 N we can still make reliable estimations\nof the position of some (usually the strongest) GW\nsources;\n\u2022 in this latter case, removing the stronger sources\nfrom the solution, also removes power belonging to\nthe weaker ones, causing their misidentification or\nmisplacement;\n\u2022 it is beneficial to run low N -source models even if\nwe know that there are many more sources. Our\nresults show that such low N -source models usually allow detection and correct sky location of the\nbrightest GW sources;\n\nFIG. 10. Example of residuals used in the blind search.\nThe dataset contained a superposition of five monochromatic\nsources at f = 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 Hz, shown as a black line in the upper\npanel. The central panel shows an example of dataset (black\nline) made of a Gaussian white noise with \u03c3 = 30ns plus the\ninjected signal (red line). The lower panel show the residual\nnoise after the best estimate of the signal was removed. The\nresidual signal after removal of the best estimate is shown as\na red\u2013dashed line in the upper panel.\n\ntional wave sources individually. To this purpose, we employ a maximum likelihood-based algorithm and tested\nits performance in a number of simple, idealized situations. Under the simplifications and assumptions listed\nin the Section II, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\u2022 to estimate the sky location of all N GW source\n\n\u2022 computation of the likelihood with increasingly\nnumber of sources assumed in the model resolves\nmore GW sources but at the same time increases\nthe ambiguity (error) regions;\n\u2022 if the GW sources are located close to each other in\nthe sky, they cannot be reliably resolved individually, and appear as a single large ambiguity region.\nHowever, the maximum likelihood estimator usually favors multi source models, giving valuable information on the number of sources present in the\ncluster;\n\u2022 in the limit of low number N of GW sources, the\nmaximum likelihood estimator allows to infer the\ncorrect number of sources present in the datasets\n(as long as P > 3 \u00d7 N ). In the noiseless case, even\nby using very primitive search techniques, we are\nable to correctly identify and locate all the sources\nin the sky within few degrees of their true location;\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 11. Results of the blind search with noise. Left panel: 'easy search'; filled\u2013black circles represent the injected sources,\nwhereas each set of colored symbols represents a 'high likelihood' solution of the blind search. Right panel: same as the left\npanel but for the 'hard search'. The size of the black dots is proportional to the injected source strength; the size of the colored\nsymbols is proportional to their contribution to the likelihood.\n\nSMBHBs;\n\u2022 in presence of noise, we can also infer the correct\nnumber of sources and locate the bright ones in\nthe sky. The presence of dimmer sources can be\ncorrectly inferred, but due to their low SNR they\nare easily misplaced.\n\n3. include the pulsar terms in the signal and perform\nfrequency searches;\n\nThis study mostly represents a proof of concept of the\npossibility of utilizing the spatial information enclosed\nin the array to disentangle signals that would otherwise\nappear like a confusion foreground. In particular, most\nof the results were derived in the noiseless limit. On\nthe other hand, the employed search methods were very\nsimple and largely non-optimal, which somehow limited\nthe capabilities of the analysis. In future investigations,\nwe plan to expand our analysis in several ways to assess\nits full potential in more realistic scenarios. In particular\nwe will:\n\n5. optimize the effectiveness of our analysis technique\nby employing proper multimodal search algorithms,\nsimilar to those applied in [32, 33].\n\n1. test the limit of large number of sources, where\nN \u001d P;\n2. draw the source strength distribution from state of\nthe art models of the cosmological population of\n\n[1] M.
