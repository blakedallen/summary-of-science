Within the framework\nof thermal leptogenesis, the only way to lower this limit is then to allow for sufficiently small mass\ndifference M2 \u2212 M1 .\n\n\fAccumulated over the past years data on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are\nconsistent with the minimal see-saw mechanism of neutrino mass generation. Barring the LSND\nanomaly, all the remaining data can be explained by the mixing of three light active neutrino\nspecies with differences of the masses squared equal to:\n\u2206m2sol \u2248 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2\n\n\u2206m2atm \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\n\n(1)\n\nand the so-called bi-large pattern of the unitary mixing matrix U. In principle, the differences\n(1) can result from different patterns of neutrino masses m\u03bdi satisfying the WMAP bound1\nP\ni m\u03bdi < 0.7 eV [1], but the most natural in the context of the see-saw mechanism [2] operating\nat some\nto the GUT scale \u223c 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV seems to be the hierarchical pattern\nq scale M close q\n>\n>\n\u2206m2atm , m\u03bd2 \u223c\n\u2206m2sol , for which the mixing pattern is stable with respect to radiative\nm\u03bd3 \u223c\ncorrections [3]. In this mechanism, whose main virtue is that it naturally explains why neutrinos\nare so light, three heavy Majorana neutrinos \u03bdAc (A = 1, 2, 3) couple to the standard SU(2)\nlepton doublets through the Lagrangian term L = \u01ebij Hi \u03bdAc Y\u03bdAB ljB +H.c. Below the mass scale\nof the lightest right-chiral neutrino the effective light neutrino mass matrix takes the form\nm\u03bd = \u2212\n\nv2 \u2217\nv2 T\nY\u03bd * M\u22121 * Y\u03bd =\nU * diag(\u03be12 , \u03be22 , \u03be32) * U\u2020\u03bd ,\n2\n2M1 \u03bd\n\n\u22122\nwhere M = M1 diag(1, x\u22122\n2 , x3 ) is the right-chiral Majorana mass matrix, v =\ndiagonalizes m\u03bd .\n\n(2)\n\u221a\n\n2hH 0 i and U\u03bd\n\nAnother attractive feature of the see-saw mechanism is the possibility of explaining the\nbaryon number B asymmetry of the Universe by the out of equilibrium lepton number L violating decays of the right-chiral neutrinos [4]. The net lepton number generated by these decays\n< M is subsequently converted into the baryon number by the sphaleron\nat temperatures T \u223c\n1\nmediated B + L violating transitions. Different theoretical models of the see-saw mechanism\nthat aim at reproducing the experimentally measured neutrino properties in a natural way can\nbe therefore further constrained by the requirement of 'successful leptogenesis'.\nThere are two classes of theoretical models of the see-saw mechanism\nwhichqcan give bi-large\nq\n2\n>\n>\n\u2206m2sol , without\nmixing for hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum m\u03bd3 \u223c \u2206matm , m\u03bd2 \u223c\ntoo much artificial fine tuning of the parameters [5]. These are the so-called 'lopsided' models\nin which large neutrino mixing arises from the charged lepton sector [6] and models in which it\nis due to some special textures of the neutrino Yukawa matrix Y\u03bd in the mass eigenstate basis\nof the charged lepton [7, 8, 9, 10]. In both types of models the see-saw mechanism is usually\ndominated by contributions of one or at most two right-chiral neutrinos, what most naturally\nhappens if their masses exhibit some hierarchy 1 = x1 > x2 \u226b x3 . One considers also minimal\nsee-saw models with exactly two right-chiral neutrinos [11].\nThe purpose of this note is to investigate leptogenesis in a general class of theoretical see-saw\nmodels, in which the contribution to the see-saw formula (2) of the third right-chiral neutrino\nis negligible. We will be working in the basis, in which the charged lepton Yukawa couplings\nare diagonal and therefore U = U\u03bd . As it is well-known [12], the neutrino Yukawa coupling\n1\n\nThis bound relies on some theoretical assumption and can be questioned.\n\n1\n\n\fmatrix Y\u03bd , which enters the formulae for the CP asymmetry parameters \u01ebi [13] and various\nreaction cross sections, cannot be uniquely reconstructed from the low energy quantities m\u03bdi\nand U\u03bd and the Majorana masses MA . Rather, one has [12, 14, 15, 16]\n\u1ef8\u03bdAB \u2261 (Y\u03bd U\u03bd )AB = ix\u22121\nA \u03a9AB \u03beB\n\n(3)\n\n(no summation over A and B), where the complex orthogonal matrix \u03a9 accounts for the sixparameter ambiguity in translating the neutrino masses into the neutrino Yukawa couplings\n\u1ef8\u03bd . We first point out that if one of the right-chiral neutrinos effectively decouples (either\nbecause it is very heavy or its couplings \u1ef8\u03bd3A are negligible) the prediction for the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe generated via leptogenesis depends only on M1 , x2 and \u1ef8\u03bd22 , that is,\nthe six-parameter ambiguity encoded in \u03a9 reduces to the dependence on two parameters only,\nwhich can be chosen as the modulus and the phase \u03c6 of \u1ef8\u03bd22 . For M2 \u226b M1 (x2 \u226a 1), when\nthe lepton number generated by the out of equilibrium decays of the second heavy neutrino is\ncompletely washed out by the time when the lightest right-chiral neutrinos decay, or simply the\nreheat temperature Treh is too low for the second heavy neutrino to be produced thermally, the\nleptogenesis depends only on M1 and the product x2 \u1ef8\u03bd22 which can be translated into \u03c6 and\nthe parameter m\u03031 defined in [17]. Compared to the analysis of such a scenario performed in\n[15] for the thermal production of heavy neutrinos, the assumption about the decoupling of one\nright-chiral neutrino has the following consequences. Firstly, for each point of the (M1 , m\u03031 , \u03c6)\nparameter space the relevant CP asymmetry can be unambiguously computed; its maximal\nvalue is smaller by about 20% compared to the value \u01ebmax\nfound in [14] and adopted in [15].\n1\nSecondly, and more importantly, the range of possible m\u03031 values is substantially reduced: m\u03031\nis always greater than m\u03bd2 (and not m\u03bd1 as in [15]). This significantly increases the lower limit\non M1 and, consequently, on the reheat temperature Treh for which the leptogenesis mechanism\ndominated by the decays of the lightest right-chiral neutrino can reproduce the observed baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe YB \u2248 (0.8 \u2212 1) \u00d7 10\u221210 [1]. In this letter, for technical simplicity we\nintegrate the Boltzmann equations on the non-supersymmetric scenario [17], but we believe that\n> 2\u00d71012\nour results qualitatively hold in the supersymmetric case as well. The lower limit Treh \u223c\n> 10M ), which we find in the strict decoupling limit, may then lead to too\nGeV (assuming Treh \u223c\n1\nabundant gravitino production, incompatible with the standard nucleosynthesis. The only way\nto lower Treh is to consider almost degenerate two lighter right-chiral neutrinos as advocated\nin [19]. The simplification occurring in the decoupling limit allows us to extend the analysis\nalso to this case. In particular, we investigate how fast the necessary reheat temperature Treh\ndecreases with increasing degeneracy of the two lighter right-chiral neutrinos. At the end, we\nbriefly discuss the conditions under which the results described here should apply.\nFor fixed \u03beA (i.e. for fixed see-saw masses of the left-chiral neutrinos), M1 , x2 and x3 the\nformula (2) constitutes a set of 2(3 + 6/2) = 12 real equations allowing to solve for six complex\nelements of \u1ef8\u03bdAB in terms of the remaining three. This six-parameter ambiguity is encoded in\nthe complex orthogonal matrix \u03a9 in eq. (3). If the third right-chiral neutrino is decoupled or\nsimply absent there are only six complex Yukawa couplings and, at first sight, the formula (2)\nshould determine all of them unambiguously. However, it is easy to see that the resulting set\n\n2\n\n\fof equations\n\u03beA2 \u03b4 AB +\n\nX\n\nx2C \u1ef8\u03bdCA \u1ef8\u03bdCB = 0 ,\n\nA, B = 1, 2, 3\n\n(4)\n\nC\n\nwith C = 1, 2 is self-consistent only if m\u03bd1 \u221d \u03be12 = 0. In other words, the absence or decoupling\nof one right-chiral neutrino automatically ensures det(m\u03bd ) = 0, that is m\u03bd1 = 0 (with only one\nright-chiral neutrino two eigenvalues of m\u03bd would vanish) and, hence, hierarchical or inversely\nhierarchical spectrum of the left-chiral neutrinos. For m\u03bd1 = 0 not all equations (4) are independent; as a result there is still a two-parameter freedom which can be parametrized by \u1ef8\u03bd22 .\nSince for one right-chiral neutrino (no summation over C in eq. (4)) all Yukawa couplings are\nunambiguously determined by the formula (2), it follows, that for three right-chiral neutrinos\na convenient parametrization of the ambiguity is given by the \u1ef8\u03bd22 , \u1ef8\u03bd32 and \u1ef8\u03bd33 , as it allows\nto take the limit in which heavy right-chiral neutrinos are succesively decoupled. From the\nabove it is clear that the description of leptogenesis simplifies enormously in the decoupling\nlimit for which the first condition is the sufficiently small value of m\u03bd1 and, hence, the spectrum\nof left-chiral neutrinos close to hierarchical or inversely hierarchical.\nFor x3 \u1ef8\u03bd32 = 0 and x3 \u1ef8\u03bd33 = 0 the exact solution of the equations (4) in terms of the matrix\n\u03a9 reads\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u00b1i \u22121 \u2212 z 2\niz\n\u221a\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03a9 = \uf8ed0\n\u2212iz\n\u00b1i \u22121 \u2212 z 2 \uf8f8 ,\nwhere z = (x2 /\u03be2 )\u1ef8\u03bd22 .\n(5)\n1\n0\n0\nIt is obvious that all non-vanishing quantities: \u1ef8\u03bd12 , \u1ef8\u03bd13 and x2 \u1ef8\u03bd23 depend then only on\nx2 \u1ef8\u03bd22 . The decoupling of the third right-chiral neutrino is a somewhat stronger requirement\nas it corresponds to x3 \u1ef8\u03bd3A \u2192 0 for all A = 1, 2, 3. In agreement with our previous discussion\nthis requires one massless left-chiral neutrino because, as follows from eqs.

This\nrequirement can be expressed as the condition that their decay rate \u03931 must be smaller than\nthe Hubble parameter H at the temperature T \u223c M1 [20, 17]. This in turn translates into the\nfollowing condition [14]:\nX\n< 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV .\nm\u03031 \u2261\n(9)\n|\u03a921A |m\u03bdA \u223c\nA\n\nFor m\u03031 of this order and larger the wash-out processes are very efficient and suppress the\nresulting lepton asymmetry [17, 15].

As a result, in order to\nreproduce the observed baryon asymmetry through the leptogenesis the mass M1 of the lightest\nright-chiral neutrino has to be about two orders of magnitude bigger than its lower limit found\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: Lower limits on M1 for x2 = 0.01, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.95 (solid, dashed, dotted and\ndash-dotted lines, respectively) as functions of |\u1ef8\u03bd22 | (panel a) and m\u03031 (panel b).\nin [15] for general see-saw models leading to the hierarchical spectrum of light neutrinos.

In agreement with our discussion, for x \u223c\nwhen the lepton number asymmetry arises entirely from the lightest neutrino decays, the limits\non M1 depend only on x2 \u1ef8\u03bd22 that is on m\u03031 (the three curves corresponding to x2 = 0.01, 0.1\nand 0.3 merge into a single one when plotted against m\u03031 ) and not on x2 and \u1ef8\u03bd22 separately. It is\nworth stressing that in the range of m\u03031 values accessible in the considered limit, the prediction\nfor the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is almost insensitive to the initial abundance of the\nfirst right-chiral neutrinos [17, 15]. One should also note that our results are consistent and\ngeneralize those obtained in ref. [11] in the specific see-saw model with exactly two right-chiral\nneutrinos.\nA non-trivial dependence on x2 and \u1ef8\u03bd22 separately can arise only through direct contribution of the second heavy neutrino to the generated lepton asymmetry. This is shown if fig. 3a\nwhere we plot the lower limit on M1 for the case of degenerate two right-chiral neutrinos.3 The\ndependence of this lower limit on the degeneracy of the two right-chiral neutrinos is shown in\nfig. 3b.

Linear dependence of M1min on the degeneracy parameter \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 M1 /M2 = 1 \u2212 x22 seen in fig. 3b for \u03b4 < 0.05 is related to the fact that\nfor degenerate two right-chiral neutrinos both, \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 , are proportional to M1 /\u03b4 [16]. From\nfig. 3 it follows that in this framework lowering M1 below 109 \u2212 108 GeV can be achieved if\n< 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 . The stability of such a degenerate mass pattern is however an open question.\n\u03b4\u223c\nAnother possibility is to consider a non-thermal production of right-chiral neutrinos and \u2212 in\nthe supersymmetric scenario \u2212 sneutrinos [21].

Solving explicitly the set\nof equations (4) with C = 1, 2, 3 in terms of \u1ef8\u03bd22 , \u1ef8\u03bd32 and \u1ef8\u03bd33 it is easy to see (we have also\nchecked it numerically) that as long as\nn\n\nx3 |\u1ef8\u03bd3A | < O(0.1) min x2 |\u1ef8\u03bd22 |, \u03beA\n\no\n\n,\n\nfor\n\nA = 2, 3\n\n(10)\n\nthe resulting values of \u01eb1 and m\u03031 and, hence, the predictions for the B \u2212 L abundance are\nalmost unchanged.

To see this explicitly, we note that this is\npossible only if m\u03031 can be made substantially smaller than m\u03bd2 [15] keeping at the same time\nP\nnot too small |\u01eb1 |. From the formulae (7), (9) and the orthogonality relation B \u03a921B = 1 it\nfollows that this requires \u03a9211 \u2248 1 and, for A = 2, 3, \u03a921A \u223c O(m\u03bd1 /m\u03bdA ) with nonnegligible\nimaginary part. The orthogonality relation applied to the first column of \u03a9 then implies that\n\u03a9231 is at most of order O(m\u03bd1 /m\u03bd3 ).
