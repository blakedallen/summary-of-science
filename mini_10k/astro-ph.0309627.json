These observations\nimply that the dark matter in our neighborhood is dominated by a single flow whose\ndensity and velocity vector are estimated.\n\n1\n\nA Giant Stellar Ring in the Milky Way Plane\n\nRecently the discovery was announced of what appears to be a ring of stars, with\nradius of order 20 kpc, circling the Galaxy [1,2,3]. I will not discuss the evidence\nfor the alleged ring of stars, but merely assume that it exists. The existence of\nsuch a ring is puzzling. In ref. [1], the ring is interpreted as the tidal stream\nfrom an accreted satellite galaxy. However, in this interpretation it is hard to\naccount for the fact that the star population is confined to a nearly circular\nregion [2]. Also, it would be an accident that the tidal stream lies in the Galactic\nplane. Ibata et al. [2] propose instead that the ring of stars is a perturbation\nof the Galactic disk population. They do not however explain what causes the\nperturbation. I would like to propose that the perturbation that causes the ring\nof stars at r = 20 kpc is the gravitational field of a caustic ring of dark matter.\nSeveral years ago caustic rings of dark matter were predicted in the Galactic\nplane at radii an \u2243 40 kpc/n where n = 1, 2, 3, .. [4]. The ring of stars at\nr = 20 kpc may be baryonic matter accreted onto the n = 2 caustic ring of dark\nmatter. This interpretation would account for both its radius and its location in\nthe Galactic plane.\nThe existence of dark matter caustics in the halos of galaxies is a corollary\nof the observation [5] that cold dark matter particles lie on a three-dimensional\nsheet in six-dimensional phase-space. There are compelling reasons to believe\nthat the dark matter of the universe is constituted in large part of non-baryonic\ncollisionless particles with very small primordial velocity dispersion, such as axions and/or weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Generically, such\n\n\f2\n\nPierre Sikivie\n\nparticles are called cold dark matter (CDM). The primordial velocity dispersion\nof the leading cold dark matter candidates is extremely small, of order 10\u221212 c\nfor WIMPs and 3 * 10\u221217 c (at most) for axions. This means that, before the onset of structure formation, all the particles at a given location x have the same\nvelocity v(x), i.e. the particles lie on a 3-dim. sheet in 6-dim. phase space. The\nthickness of the sheet is the velocity dispersion. Because the number of particles\nis huge (of order 1084 axions and/or 1068 WIMPs per galactic halo), the sheet\nis effectively continuous. It cannot break and hence its evolution is constrained\nby topology.\n\n2\n\nThe Phase-Space Structure of Galactic Halos\n\nWhere a galaxy forms, the sheet wraps up in phase-space, turning clockwise\nin any two dimensional cut (x, \u1e8b) of that space. x is the physical space coordinate in an arbitrary direction and \u1e8b its associated velocity. The outcome of\nthis process is a discrete set of flows at any physical point in a galactic halo\n[5]. Two flows are associated with particles falling through the galaxy for the\nfirst time (n = 1), two other flows are associated with particles falling through\nthe galaxy for the second time (n = 2), and so on. Scattering in the gravitational wells of inhomogeneities in the galaxy (e.g. molecular clouds and globular\nclusters) are ineffective in thermalizing the flows with low values of n. Recently,\nStiff and Widrow [6] have put these discrete flows, also called 'velocity peaks',\ninto evidence in N -body simulations using a new technique which increases the\nresolution of the simulations in the relevant regions of phase-space.\nA commonly raised objection to the above picture is that before the dark\nmatter falls onto a large galaxy, such as our own, it has already clustered on\nsmaller scales, making dwarf halos and other types of clumps, in a process called\n\"hierarchical clustering\". However, this is not a valid objection. The effect of\nhierarchical clustering is only to produce an effective velocity dispersion for the\ninfalling dark matter, i.e. a thickening of the phase space sheet. This effective\nvelocity dispersion is at most equal to the velocity dispersion, of order 10 km/s, of\ndwarf halos and on average should be much less than that. Because the effective\nvelocity dispersion of the infalling dark matter is much less than the 300 km/s\nvelocity dispersion of the Galaxy as a whole, the phase space sheet folds in\nqualitatively the same way as in the zero velocity dispersion case. The flows and\ncaustics remain.\nCaustics appear wherever the projection of the phase-space sheet onto physical space has a fold [4,7,8,9]. Generically, caustics are surfaces in physical space.\nOn one side of the caustic surface there are two more flows than on the other.\nAt the surface, the dark matter density is very large. It diverges there in the\nlimit of zero velocity dispersion. There are two types of caustics in the halos of\ngalaxies, inner and outer. The outer caustics are simple fold (A2 ) catastrophes\nlocated on topological spheres surrounding the galaxy. They occur near where a\ngiven outflow reaches its furthest distance from the galactic center before falling\nback in. The inner caustics are rings [4]. They occur near where the particles\n\n\fWhy a ring of stars at r = 20 kpc?\n\n3\n\nwith the most angular momentum in a given inflow reach their distance of closest approach to the galactic center before going back out. A caustic ring is a\nclosed tube whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic (D\u22124 ) catastrophe [7]. The\nexistence of these caustics and their topological properties are independent of\nany assumptions of symmetry.\nPrimordial peculiar velocities are expected to be the same for baryonic and\ndark matter particles because they are caused by gravitational forces. Later the\nvelocities of baryons and CDM differ because baryons collide with each other\nwhereas CDM is collisionless. However, because angular momentum is conserved,\nthe net angular momenta of the dark matter and baryonic components of a\ngalaxy are aligned. Since the caustic rings are located near where the particles\nwith the most angular momentum in a given infall are at their closest approach\nto the galactic center, they lie close to the galactic plane.\nA specific proposal was made for the radii an of caustic rings [4]:\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012\nvrot\njmax\n(1)\n{an : n = 1, 2, ...} \u2243 (39, 19.5, 13, 10, 8, ...)kpc \u00d7\n0.25\n220 km\ns\nwhere vrot is the rotation velocity of the galaxy and jmax is a parameter with\na specific value for each halo. For large n, an \u221d 1/n. Eq. 1 is predicted by\nthe self-similar infall model [10,11] of galactic halo formation. jmax is then the\nmaximum of the dimensionless angular momentum j-distribution [11]. The selfsimilar model depends upon a parameter \u01eb [10]. In CDM theories of large scale\n\nFig. 1. Composite rotation curve constructed in ref. [12]. It combines data on 32 exterior galaxies to test the hypothesis that the caustic ring radii are given by Eq. (1).\n\n\f4\n\nPierre Sikivie\n\nstructure formation, \u01eb is expected to be in the range 0.2 to 0.35 [11]. Eq. 1 is\nfor \u01eb = 0.3. However, in the range 0.2 < \u01eb < 0.35, the ratios an /a1 are almost\nindependent of \u01eb. When jmax values are quoted below, \u01eb = 0.3 and h = 0.7 will\nbe assumed.\nIt was pointed out in ref. [11] that including angular momentum in the selfsimilar infall model results in a depletion of the inner halo and hence an effective\ncore radius. The average amount of angular momentum of the Milky Way halo\nwas estimated [11] by requiring that approximately half of the rotation velocity\nsquared at our location is due to dark matter, the other half being due to ordinary\nmatter. This yields j\u0304 \u223c 0.2 where j\u0304 is the average of the j-distribution for our\nhalo. j\u0304 and jmax are related if some assumption is made about the shape of the\nj-distribution. For example, if the j-distribution is taken to be that of a rigidly\nrotating sphere, one has jmax = \u03c04 j\u0304. Hence jmax \u223c 0.25 for our halo.\nSince caustic rings lie close to the galactic plane, they cause bumps in the\nrotation curve, at the locations of the rings. In ref. [12] a set of 32 extended\nwell-measured rotation curves was analyzed and statistical evidence was found\nfor the n = 1 and n = 2 caustic rings, distributed according to Eq. 1. In this\nanalysis, each of the 32 individual galactic rotation curves was rescaled according\nto\n\u0013\n\u0012\n220 km/s\n(2)\nr \u2192 r\u0303 = r\nvrot\nwhere vrot is the measured rotation velocity. To isolate the outer halo-dominated\nportion of the rotation curves, all data with rescaled radii r\u0303 < 10 kpc were\nremoved. Each rotation curve was then fitted to a line or a quadratic polynomial.\nThe residual deviations were normalized to the rms deviation in each fit and then\nbinned together. The result is the composite rotation shown in Fig. 1 for the case\nwhere the individual rotation curves were fitted to quadratic polynomials. The\ncomposite rotation curve has two peaks, near 20 kpc and 40 kpc, with statistical\nsignificance of 3\u03c3 and 2.6\u03c3 respectively. It implies that the jmax distribution is\npeaked near 0.27. The rotation curve of NGC3198, one of the best measured,\nby itself shows three faint bumps which are consistent with Eq. 1 and jmax =\n0.28 [4]. Also our earlier estimate of jmax for the Milky Way halo is close to the\npeak value of 0.27.\n\n3\n\nEvidence for Ring Caustics in the Milky Way\n\nEq. 1 with jmax = 0.25 implies that our halo has caustic rings with radii near\n40 kpc/n, where n is an integer. Here we point to evidence in support of this\nextraordinary claim.\nIt was already mentioned that the recently discovered ring of stars at r = 20\nkpc may be interpreted as baryonic matter accreted onto the n = 2 caustic ring\nof dark matter. This interpretation accounts for the 20 kpc radius of the ring\nas well as for its location in the galactic plane. The spatial coincidence of the\n20 kpc ring of stars with the predicted n = 2 caustic ring may, of course, be\nfortuitous. So it is natural to ask whether there is similar evidence for any of the\n\n\fWhy a ring of stars at r = 20 kpc?\n\n5\n\nother caustic rings. The answer is yes for the n = 3 ring. Binney and Dehnen\nstudied [13] the outer rotation curve of the Milky Way and concluded that its\nanomalous behavior can be explained if most of the tracers of the rotation are\nconcentrated in a ring of radius 1.6 r\u2299 where r\u2299 is our distance to the galactic\ncenter. Throughout this paper we use the standard value r\u2299 = 8.5 kpc. That\nvalue is assumed in Eq. 1, and also in refs. [1,2]. The Binney and Dehnen ring\nis therefore at 13.6 kpc, which is very close to the predicted radius of the n = 3\ncaustic ring. Moreover, there is independent evidence for the existence of the\nBinney and Dehnen ring.\nOlling and Merrifield have recently published [14] a rotation curve for the\nMilky Way. It is reproduced in Fig. 2. It shows a significant rise between 12.7\nand 13.7 kpc. The increase in rotation velocity is 27%, from 220 to 280 km/s. A\nring of matter in the Galactic plane produces a rise the rotation curve. The rise\nexpected from the n = 3 caustic ring of dark matter, by itself, is only of order 3%.\nHowever, the effect of a caustic ring of dark matter is amplified by the ordinary\nmatter (stars, gas, dust ..) which it attracts gravitationally. The amplification\nwould have to be by a factor of order nine in the case of the n = 3 ring. One\nmay think, at first, that such as a large amplification is implausible because the\nback reaction of the ring of ordinary matter upon the caustic ring of dark matter\nwould determine the position of the latter, instead of the latter determining the\nposition of the former. However this is not so because the dark matter caustic\nis not an overdensity of particles which are at rest with respect to the caustic\nring. The particles which at a given time make up the caustic ring are moving\nwith great speed, of order 360 km/s for n = 3, and are continually replaced by\nnew particles. As a result, the position of the caustic ring is insensitive to the\ngravitational field of the matter it attracts.\nThe existence of rings of ordinary matter precisely where the n = 2 and\nn = 3 rings of dark matter are predicted may yet be fortuitous. Fig. 1 does not\nshow a significant rise near the predicted location (10 kpc) of the n = 4 caustic\nring. Note however that the error bars in Fig. 1 are very large for r > r\u2299 . The\nrise near 10 kpc, if indeed there is one, may be too small to show up in the data.\nOn the other hand, the inner (r < r\u2299 ) part of the rotation curve is far better\nmeasured, and we may go look for rises there.\nGalactic rotation curves are obtained from HI and CO surveys of the Galactic\nplane. A list of surveys performed to date is given in ref. [15]. Everything else\nbeing equal, CO surveys have far better angular resolution than HI surveys\nbecause their wavelength is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller (0.26 cm\nvs. 21 cm). The most detailed inner Galactic rotation curve appears to be that\nobtained [16] from the Massachusetts-Stony Brook North Galactic Plane CO\nsurvey [17]. It is reproduced in Fig. 3. It shows highly significant rises between\n3 and 8.5 kpc. Eq. 1 predicts ten caustic rings between 3 and 8.5 kpc. Allowing\nfor ambiguities in identifying rises, the number of rises in the rotation curve\nbetween 3 and 8.5 kpc is in fact approximately ten. Below 3 kpc the predicted\nrises are so closely spaced that they are unlikely to be resolved in the data.\n\n\f6\n\nPierre Sikivie\n\nTable I lists ten rises, identified by the radius r1 where they start, the radius\nr2 where they end, and the increase \u2206v in rotation velocity. The rises are marked\nas slanted line segments in Fig. 3. The evidence for the rise between 7.30 and\n7.42 kpc is relatively weak, so the corresponding numbers are in parenthesis in\nthe Table.\nThe effect of a caustic ring in the plane of a galaxy upon its rotation curve\nwas analyzed in ref. [7]. The caustic ring produces a rise in the rotation curve\nwhich starts at r1 = an , where an is the caustic ring radius, and which ends a\nr2 = an + pn , where pn is the caustic ring width. The ring widths depend in\na complicated way on the velocity distribution of the infalling dark matter at\nlast turnaround [7] and are not predicted by the model. They also need not be\nconstant along the ring.\nIn the past, rises (or bumps) in galactic rotation curves have been interpreted\nas due to the presence of spiral arms [18]. Spiral arms may in fact cause some\nof the rises in rotation curves. This does not, however, exclude the possibility\nof other valid explanations. Two properties of the high resolution rotation curve\nof Fig. 3 favor the interpretation that its rises are caused by caustic rings of\ndark matter. First, there are of order ten rises in the range of radii covered (3 to\n8.5 kpc). This agrees qualitatively with the predicted number of caustic rings,\nwhereas only three spiral arms are known in that range: Scutum, Sagittarius and\nLocal. Second, the rises are sharp transitions in the rotation curve, both where\n\nFig. 2. Milky Way rotation curve from ref. [14].

Sharp transitions are consistent with\ncaustic rings because the latter have divergent density at r1 = a and r2 = a + p\nin the limit of vanishing velocity dispersion. Finally, there are bumps and rises\nin rotation curves measured at galactocentric distances much larger than the\ndisk radius, where no spiral arms are seen. In particular, the features found in\nthe composite rotation curve of Fig. 1 are at distances 20 kpc and 40 kpc when\nscaled to our own galaxy.\nThe self-similar infall model prediction for the caustic ring radii, Eq. 1, was\n14\nX\nfitted to the eight rises between 3 and 7 kpc by minimizing rmsd \u2261 [ 18\n(1 \u2212\nn=7\n\nan 2 12\nr1n ) ]\n\nwith respect to jmax , for \u01eb = 0.30 . The fit yields jmax = 0.263 and\nrmsd = 3.1% . The fourth column of Table I shows the corresponding caustic\nring radii an . In Fig. 3 the latter are indicated by short vertical line segments.\nThe velocity increase due to a caustic ring is given by\n\u2206vn = vrot fn\n\n\u2206I(\u03b6n )\n.\ncos \u03b4n (0) + \u03c6\u2032n (0) sin \u03b4n (0)\n\n(3)\n\nThe fn , defined in ref.

Like the pn , the latter\nparameters depend in a complicated way on the velocity distribution of the dark\nmatter at last turnaround. On the basis of the discussion in ref.

The size of these fluctuations is easily a factor two, up or down.\nThe fifth column of Table I shows \u2206vn with the fluctuating ratio set equal to\n \u0304 n \u2261 fn vrot .\none, i.e. \u2206v\nFor the reasons just stated, the fact that the observed \u2206v fluctuate by a\nfactor of order 2 from one rise to the next is consistent with the interpretation\nthat the rises are due to caustic rings. However the observed \u2206v (column 3) are\ntypically a factor 5 larger than the velocity increases expected from the caustic\nrings acting alone (column 5). This is similar to what we found for the n = 3\ncaustic ring, and suggests that the effects of the n = 5...14 caustic rings are also\namplified by baryonic matter they have accreted. I'll argue that the gas in the\ndisk has sufficiently high density and low velocity dispersion to produce such\nlarge amplification factors. I'll also give observational evidence in support of the\nhypothesis.\n\n\fWhy a ring of stars at r = 20 kpc?\n\n9\n\nThe equilibrium distribution of gas is:\ndgas (r) = dgas (r 0 ) exp[\u2212\n\n3\n(\u03c6(r) \u2212 \u03c6(r 0 ))] ,\n2 >\n< vgas\n\n(4)\n\nwhere d is density and \u03c6 gravitational potential. In the solar neighborhood,\ngr\ndgas \u2243 3 *10\u221224 cm\n3 [19], which is comparable to the density of dark matter inside\nthe tubes of caustic rings near us. From the scale height of the gas [19] and the\nassumption that it is in equilibrium with itself and the other disk components,\n1\n2\nI estimate hvgas\ni 2 \u2243 8 km/s. The variation in the gravitational potential due to\n2\n2\np/a \u2243 (5 km\na caustic ring over the size of the tube is of order \u2206\u03c6CR \u2243 2f vrot\ns ) .\n3\nBecause <v2 > \u2206\u03c6CR is of order one, the caustic rings have a large effect on the\ngas\ndistribution of gas in the disk. The accreted gas amplifies and can dominate the\neffect of the caustic rings on the rotation curve. To check whether this hypothesis\nis consistent with the shape of the rises would require detailed modeling, as well\nas detailed knowledge on how the rotation curve is measured. However, there is\nobservational evidence in support of the hypothesis.\nThe accreted gas may reveal the location of caustic rings in maps of the sky.\nLooking tangentially to a ring caustic from a vantage point in the plane of the\nring, one may recognize the tricusp [7] shape of the D\u22124 catastrophe. I searched\nfor such features. The IRAS map of the galactic disk in the direction of galactic coordinates (l, b) = (80\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) shows a triangular shape which is strikingly\nreminiscent of the cross-section of a ring caustic. The relevant IRAS maps are\nposted at http://www.phys.ufl.edu/\u223csikivie/triangle/ . They were downloaded\nfrom the Skyview Virtual Observatory (http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The vertices of the triangle are at (l, b) = (83.5\u25e6 , 0.4\u25e6 ), (77.8\u25e6 , 3.4\u25e6 ) and (77.8\u25e6 , \u22122.6\u25e6 ).\nThe shape is correctly oriented with respect to the galactic plane and the galactic\ncenter. To an extraordinary degree of accuracy it is an isosceles triangle with axis\nof symmetry parallel to the galactic plane, as is expected for a caustic ring whose\ntransverse dimensions are small compared to its radius. Moreover its position is\nconsistent with the position of a rise in the rotation curve, the one between 8.28\nand 8.43 kpc (n = 5). The caustic ring radius implied by the image is 8.31 kpc\nand its dimensions are p \u223c 130 pc and q \u223c 200 pc, in the directions parallel\nand perpendicular to the galactic plane respectively. It therefore predicts a rise\nwhich starts at 8.31 kpc and ends at 8.44 kpc, just where a rise is observed. The\nprobability that the coincidence in position of the triangular shape with a rise\nin the rotation curve is fortuitous is less than 10\u22123 .\nIn principle, the feature at (80\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) should be matched by another in the opposite tangent direction to the nearby ring caustic, at approximately (\u221280\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ).\nAlthough there is a plausible feature there, it is much less compelling than the\none in the (+80\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) direction. There are several reasons why it may not appear\nas strongly. One is that the (+80\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) feature is in the middle of the Local spiral\narm, whose stellar activity enhances the local gas and dust emissivity, whereas\nthe (\u221280\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) feature is not so favorably located. Another is that the ring caustic in the (+80\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 ) direction has unusually small dimensions. This may make\n\n\f10\n\nPierre Sikivie\n\nit more visible by increasing its contrast with the background. In the (\u221280\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 )\ndirection, the nearby ring caustic may have larger transverse dimensions.\n\n4\n\nThe Big Flow\n\nOur proximity to a caustic ring means that the corresponding flows, i.e. the\nflows in which the caustic occurs, contribute very importantly to the local dark\nmatter density. Using the results of refs. [4,7,11], we can estimate their densities\nand velocity vectors. Let us assume, for illustrative purposes, that we are in the\nplane of the nearby caustic and that its outward cusp is 55 pc away from us, i.e.\na5 + p5 = 8.445 kpc. The densities and velocity vectors on Earth of the n = 5\nflows are then:\nd+ = 1.7 10\u221224\n\ngr\ngr\nkm\n, d\u2212 = 1.5 10\u221225\n, v \u00b1 = (470 \u03c6\u0302 \u00b1 100 r\u0302)\n, (5)\ncm3\ncm3\ns\n\nwhere r\u0302, \u03c6\u0302 and \u1e91 are the local unit vectors in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates. \u03c6\u0302 is in the direction of galactic rotation. The velocities are given in\nthe (non-rotating) rest frame of the Galaxy. Because of an ambiguity, it is not\npresently possible to say whether d\u00b1 are the densities of the flows with velocity\nv \u00b1 or v \u2213 . The large size of d+ is due to our proximity to the outward cusp of\nthe nearby caustic. Its exact value is sensitive to our distance to the cusp. We\ndo not know that distance well enough to estimate d+ with accuracy. However\nwe can say that d+ is very large, of order the value given in Eq. 5, perhaps even\nlarger. If we are inside the tube of the nearby caustic, there are two additional\nflows on Earth, aside from those given in Eq. 5. A list of local densities and\nvelocity vectors for the n 6= 5 flows can be found in ref. [20]. An updated list is\nin preparation.\nEq. 5 has dramatic implications for dark matter searches. Previous estimates\nof the local dark matter density, based on isothermal halo profiles, range from\ngr\n+\n5 to 7.5 10\u221225 cm\n3 . The present analysis implies that a single flow (d ) has of\norder three times (or more) that much local density.\nThe sharpness of the rises in the rotation curve and of the triangular feature\nin the IRAS map implies an upper limit on the velocity dispersion \u03b4vDM of the\ninfalling dark matter. Caustic ring singularities are spread over a distance of\norder \u03b4a \u2243 R \u03b4vv DM where v is the velocity of the particles in the caustic, \u03b4vDM\nis their velocity dispersion, and R is their turnaround radius. The sharpness of\nthe IRAS feature implies that its edges are spread over \u03b4a <\n\u223c 20 pc. Assuming\nthat the feature is due to the n = 5 ring caustic, R \u2243 180 kpc and v \u2243 480\nkm/s. Therefore \u03b4vDM <\n\u223c 53 m/s. This bound is strongly at odds with the often\nquoted claim that structure formation on small scales causes all, or nearly all, late\ninfalling dark matter to be in dwarf galaxy type clumps, with velocity dispersion\nof order 10 km/s.\nThe caustic ring model may explain the puzzling persistence of galactic disk\nwarps [21]. These may be due to outer caustic rings lying somewhat outside the\ngalactic plane and attracting visible matter. The resulting disk warps would not\n\n\fWhy a ring of stars at r = 20 kpc?\n\n11\n\ndamp away, as is the case in more conventional explanations of the origin of the\nwarps, but would persist on cosmological time scales.\nThe caustic ring model, and more specifically the prediction Eq. 5 of the\nlocally dominant flow associated with the nearby ring, has important consequences for axion dark matter searches [22], the annual modulation [20,23,24,25]\nand signal anisotropy [26,24] in WIMP searches, the search for \u03b3-rays from dark\nmatter annihilation [27], and the search for gravitational lensing by dark matter\ncaustics [8,28]. The model makes predictions for each of these approaches to the\ndark matter problem.\nI thank the Aspen Center for Physics for its hospitality while this paper was\nwritten.
