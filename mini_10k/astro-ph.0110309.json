The Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey (LCDCS), which\ncontains over 1000 cluster candidates at z>0.3, is a unique sample with\nwhich to probe the evolution of both cluster galaxies and the properties of the cluster population. Programs are now underway to utilize the\nLCDCS for both purposes. We provide a brief overview of these programs,\nand also present new results for the LCDCS cluster correlation function.\nUtilizing well-defined, approximately dispersion-limited subsamples, we\nmeasure the angular correlation function for clusters at z\u22480.5. Spatial\ncorrelation lengths are then derived via Limber inversion. We find that\nthe correlation length depends upon mass, as parameterized by the mean\ncluster separation, in a manner that is consistent with both local observations and CDM predictions for the clustering strength at z=0.5.\n\n1.\n\nSummary\n\nThe past few years have been a period of tremendous progress in detection of\ndistant clusters. As recently as five years ago no single survey contained more\nthan ten cluster candidates at z>0.5, but a series of efforts have since led to a\nseveral order of magnitude increase in the number of known high-redshift systems\n(Postman et al. 1996, Scodeggio et al. 1999, Gladders & Yee 2001, Gonzalez\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGonzalez et al.\n\net al. 2001). The recently completed Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey\n(LCDCS) is our contribution to this field. Clusters in the LCDCS are detected\nas regions of excess optical surface brightness relative to the background sky,\na technique that permits detection of clusters to z\u22480.9 with shallow, drift-scan\nimaging. The resulting statistical catalog consists of 1073 cluster candidates\nat z >0.3.\nTo enable efficient use of these catalogs we use follow-up imaging\n\u223c\nand spectroscopy to characterize the properties of the sample, including the\ncontamination rate as well as estimates of the redshifts and relative velocity\ndispersions of the candidates (see Gonzalez et al. 2001a for details).\nOne application of this sample is determination of the cluster correlation\nfunction (Gonzalez et al. 2001b). For roughly dispersion-limited subsamples at\nz\u22480.5 the observed angular correlation functions are well fit by the power law\n\u03c9(\u03b8) = A\u03c9 \u03b8 1\u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3 = 2.1. Using the angular correlation data, we derive\nthe spatial correlation length (r0 ) as a function of mean intracluster separation\n(dc ) via the cosmological Limber inversion. We find correlation lengths for the\nLCDCS that are similar to those observed for local catalogs, and observe a\ndependence of r0 upon dc that is comparable to the results of Croft et al. (1997)\nfor the APM catalog. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations,\nwhich predict only modest evolution in the clustering amplitude since z=0.5.\nSeveral programs are also being conducted with LCDCS clusters to study\nthe evolution of cluster galaxies. Nelson et al. (2001a, b) are studying the structural and luminosity evolution of BCG's; Nelson et al. (2001c) are studying\nevolution in the luminosity function and color of the red envelope. Meanwhile,\nthe EDisCS collaboration is conducting a deep multicolor imaging and spectroscopic survey of 20 of the most massive LCDCS candidates at z=0.5 and z=0.8,\nwith the aim of constraining cluster galaxy morphologies, scaling relations, cluster dynamics, and the evolution of cluster galaxies at these epochs.\nReferences\nCroft, R.
