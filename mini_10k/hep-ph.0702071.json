The interaction of particles a\nand b with the matter is described by a potentials Ua,b . ImUb is responsible for loss of b-particle\nintensity. The wave functions \u03a8a,b are given by equations of motion. The index of refraction,\nthe forward scattering amplitude f (0) and potential are related to each other, so later on the\nstandard approach is referred to as potential model.\nDescription of absorption by means of ImUb is at least imperfect and should be partially\nrevised. As an illustration, let us consider the case of strong b-particle absorption. Instead of\nperiodic process, we get two-step system decay\n(a \u2212 medium) \u2192 (b \u2212 medium) \u2192 f.\n\n(1)\n\nHere (b \u2212 medium) \u2192 f represents the b-particle absorption. The potential model does not\ndescribe this process as well as the total ab transition probability (see [5,6] and next section).\nIt describes the probability of finding a b-particle only.\nBy way of specific example we consider the nn\u0304 transitions in medium followed by annihilation\n[7-13]\n(n \u2212 medium) \u2192 (n\u0304 \u2212 medium) \u2192 M,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M are the annihilation mesons. The qualitative process picture is as follows. The freespace nn\u0304 transition comes from the exchange of Higgs bosons with the mass mH > 105 GeV\n[8,9]. From the dynamical point of view this is a momentary process: \u03c4c \u223c 1/mH < 10\u221229 s.\nThe antineutron annihilates in a time \u03c4a \u223c 1/\u0393, where \u0393 is the annihilation width of n\u0304 in the\nmedium. We deal with two-step process with the characteristic time \u03c42 \u223c \u03c4a .\nThe potential model describes the probability of finding an antineutron only, whereas a\nmain contribution gives the process (2) because n\u0304 annihilates in a time \u03c4a . In the following we\nconsider the nn\u0304 transitions since the final state absorption in this case is extremely strong.\nSo the model should describe the two-step processes like (1) and (2). On the other hand,\nas absorption Hamiltonian tends to zero, the well-known results on particle oscillations should\nbe reproduced. This program is realized below.\nAlso we present here an elaborated derivation of the lower limit on the nn\u0304 oscillation time\nand discuss in some detail the uncertainties connected with medium corrections.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we recall the main results and point\nout the chief drawback of the potential model. In this model the nn\u0304 transition probability\ndepends critically on the antineutron self-energy \u03a3. In the field-theoretical approach the similar\npicture takes place (Sects. 3 and 4). Because of this, the particular attention is given to the\nsuppression mechanism and origin of \u03a3. In Sect. 4 we arrive at the conclusion that \u03a3 = 0. An\n2\n\n\fimportant effect of the competition between scattering and annihilation of n\u0304 in the intermediate\nstate is studied as well. The main calculations are performed in Sects. 5 and 6. If \u03a3 = 0, the\nS-matrix amplitudes contain the infrared singularity. For solving the problem the approach\nwith finite time interval (FTA) [14] is used. It is infrared free. First of all we verify the FTA\nby the example of exactly solvable potential model. The FTA reproduces all the results on\nthe particle oscillations (\u03bda \u03bdb , nn\u0304, etc). In Sect. 6 the process (2) and process shown in Fig.\n8b are calculated. The linkage between the S-matrix theory and FTA is studied as well. In\nSect. 7 we complete the calculation of process (2). Also we arrive at the conclusion that for\nthe processes with zero momentum transfer the problem should be formulated on the finite\ntime interval. The results are summarized and discussed in Sect. 8. The limiting cases and\neffects of absorption and coherent forward scattering are discussed as well. Section 9 contains\nthe conclusion.\n\n2\n\nPotential model\n\nIn this section we touch briefly on the main results and the range of applicability of potential\nmodel in the case of nn\u0304 transitions. The chief drawback of this model is given as well.\nLet Un =const. and Un\u0304 =const. be the neutron potential and optical potential of n\u0304,\nrespectively. The background field Un is included in the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 . The\ninteraction Hamiltonian has the form\nHI = Hnn\u0304 + H,\nHnn\u0304 = \u01eb\u03a8\u0304n\u0304 \u03a8n + H.c.,\nH = (ReV + iImV )\u03a8\u0304n\u0304 \u03a8n\u0304 ,\nV = Un\u0304 \u2212 Un = ReUn\u0304 \u2212 Un \u2212 i\u0393/2.\n\n(3)\n\nHere Hnn\u0304 and H are the Hamiltonians of nn\u0304 transition [11] and n\u0304-medium interaction, respectively; \u01eb a small parameter \u01eb = 1/\u03c4nn\u0304 , where \u03c4nn\u0304 is the free-space nn\u0304 oscillation time.\nThe model can be realized by means of diagram technique [5,12] or equations of motion\n[10,11,13]:\n(i\u2202t \u2212 H0 )n(x) = \u01ebn\u0304(x),\n(i\u2202t \u2212 H0 \u2212 V )n\u0304(x) = \u01ebn(x),\nH0 = \u2212\u22072 /2m + Un ,\n\n(4)\n\nn\u0304(0, x) = 0. For V =const. in the lowest order in \u01eb the probability of finding an n\u0304 in a time t\n\n3\n\n\fis found to be\nWn\u0304 (t) =\n\n\u01eb2\n[1 \u2212 2 cos(ReV t)e\u2212\u0393t/2 + e\u2212\u0393t ].\n2\n|V |\n\n(5)\n\nIn the following we focus on the most important case \u0393t \u226b 1. Then Wn\u0304 (t) \u223c \u01eb2 / | V |2 \u226a 1.\nThe total nn\u0304 transition probability Wtpot (more precisely, the probability of finding an n\u0304 or\nannihilation products) is given by\nWtpot (t)\n\n\u0393/2\n4\u01eb2 t\n= 2\u01eb t\n\u2248\n.\n(ReV )2 + (\u0393/2)2\n\u0393\n2\n\n(6)\n\nThe index \"pot\" signifies that the non-hermitian Hamiltonian (3) is used.\nThe free-space nn\u0304 transition probability Wf is Wf = \u01eb2 t2 . Comparing with Eq. (6), one\nobtains the suppression factor Rpot :\nRpot\n\nWtpot\n\u0393\n1\n=\n=\n\u223c\n\u226a 1.\n2\nWf\n|V | t\n|V |t\n\n(7)\n\nThe energy gap \u03b4E = V leads to very strong suppression of nn\u0304 transition in the medium\nand changes the functional structure of the result: Wf \u223c t2 \u2192 Wtpot \u223c t. Because of this, the\nparticular attention is given to the suppression mechanism and origin of \u03b4E.\nThe energy gap is the antineutron self-energy: \u03b4E = V = \u03a3. Indeed, the result (6) can be\nobtained by means of diagram technique:\nWtpot = 2ImTii t,\n\nGpot\n\nTii = \u2212\u01ebGpot \u01eb,\n1\n1\n=\n=\u2212 .\n2\n\u01ebn \u2212 pn /2m \u2212 Un\u0304\nV\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nHere Gpot is the antineutron propagator, p = (\u01ebn , pn ) is the neutron 4-momentum; \u01ebn =\np2n /2m + Un .\nConsider now the range of applicability of model (4). The total nn\u0304 transition probability\nWt is\nWt = Wn\u0304 + Wa ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Wa is the probability of finding the annihilation mesons (i.e. the process (2) probability).\nThe potential model describes correctly the Wn\u0304 . However, for the calculation of Wt and Wa\nit is inapplicable. In the one-particle model the total process probability Wtpot is obtained by\nmeans of Eq. (8) which follows from the unitarity condition. Since the Hamiltonian (3) is\nnon-hermitian (in the first approximation one can put ReV = 0), the S-matrix is non-unitary\nand Eq. (8) is invalid [5]. The condition of probability conservation\n1 =| Sii |2 +\n\nX\n\nf 6=i\n\n4\n\n| Tf i |2\n\n\fcan be used only if the S-matrix is unitary or unitarized.\nIt must be emphasized that in the problem under study the unitarity of S-matrix is of\nparticular importance because ImV enters the leading diagram and plays the crucial rule (see\n(9)).\nAs a result, in the potential model the effect of final state absorption acts in the opposite\n(wrong) direction [6], which is not surprising, since the unitarity condition and non-unitary\nS-matrix are mutually incompatible. The condition SS + = 1 is applied to the essentially nonunitary S-matrix. (The potential model does not describe the Wt at all. The non-unitarity\nis only formal manifestation of this fact.) As shown below, the potential model also does not\ndescribe the competition between scattering and annihilation of n\u0304 in the intermediate state and\ntime-dependence of process (2). The greater the |ImV |, the greater an error in the Wtpot and\nWa . So Eq. (6) is incorrect. The direct calculation of the antineutron absorption (process (2))\nis called for.\n\n3\n\nFree-space process\n\nFirst of all we consider the free-space n\u0304N annihilation (see Fig. 1a) and free-space process\nn + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N \u2192 M\n\n(11)\n\nshown in Fig. 1b.\n\nFigure 1: (a) Free-space n\u0304N annihilation. (b) Free-space process n + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N \u2192 M.\nThe matrix element of S-matrix Ta and amplitude Ma corresponding to Fig. 1a are defined\nas\niTa =< M | T exp(\u2212i\n\nZ\n\ndxHn\u0304N (x)) \u2212 1 | n\u0304N >= Na (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (pf \u2212 pi )Ma .\n\n5\n\n(12)\n\n\fHere < M | represents the annihilation mesons, Hn\u0304N is the Hamiltonian of n\u0304N interaction, Na\nincludes the normalization factors of the wave functions.\nTa and Ma involve all the n\u0304N interactions followed by annihilation including the n\u0304N rescattering in the initial state. The same is true for the subprocess of n\u0304N annihilation involved in\nFig. 1b: the block Ta should contain all the n\u0304N interactions followed by annihilation.\nWe write the formulas corresponding to Fig. 1b. The interaction Hamiltonian is\nHI = Hnn\u0304 + Hn\u0304N .\n\n(13)\n\nFormally, in the lowest order in Hnn\u0304 the amplitude of process (11) is given by\nM1b = \u01ebG0 Ma ,\n1\nG0 =\n.\n\u01ebn \u2212 p2n /2m\n\n(14)\n\nHere G0 is the antineutron propagator. Since Ma contains all the n\u0304N interactions followed by\nannihilation, G0 is bare. We emphasize this fact as it gives an insight into origin of \u03a3.\nDue to the zero momentum transfer in the nn\u0304-transition vertex the 4-momenta of n and n\u0304\nare equal. The both pre- and post-nn\u0304 conversion spatial wave functions of the system coincide:\n| Nnp >sp =| N n\u0304p >sp . Actually this is true for any neutron state (for any nuclear model).\nFor the time being we do not go into singularity G0 \u223c 1/0. It results from the zero\nmomentum transfer in the vertex corresponding to Hnn\u0304 . The value of \u03a3 is disconnected with\nHnn\u0304 and we want to separate these problems. The general consideration is given in Sect. 6.\n\n4\n\nnn\u0304 transitions in the medium\n\nIn this section the origin of \u03a3 (energy gap) is studied in the framework of microscopic theory.\nIt is shown that the value of \u03a3 is uniquely determined by the definition of the annihilation\namplitude of n\u0304 in the medium. It turns out that for a realistic definition \u03a3 = 0. Also we\nconsider the competition between scattering and annihilation of n\u0304 in the intermediate state.\n\n4.1\n\nS-matrix approach\n\nLet us consider the process (2). (The nn\u0304 transitions with n\u0304 in the final state are considered in\nthe next section.) We use the scheme identical to that for process (11) with the substitution\nn\u0304N \u2192 (n\u0304 \u2212 medium). The background field Un is included in the neutron wave function\n(Hamiltonian H0 ); the quadratic terms Hnn\u0304 are included in the HI :\nHI = Hnn\u0304 + H,\nH(t) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 xH(x).\n6\n\n(15)\n\n\fHere H is the hermitian Hamiltonian of n\u0304-medium interaction. The sole physical distinction\nwith the model (4) is in the Hamiltonian H. Recall that the potential model does not describe\nthe processes (2) and (11) [5,6].\nThe process amplitude M2 is uniquely determined by the Hamiltonian (15)\nm\nM2 = \u01ebGm\n0 Ma ,\n1\nGm\n0 =\n2\n\u01ebn \u2212 pn /2m \u2212 Un\n\n(16)\n\n(see Fig. 2a). The matrix element of S-matrix Tfn\u0304i and amplitude of antineutron annihilation\nin the medium Mam are\niTfn\u0304i =< f | T n\u0304 | 0n\u0304p >= N(2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (pf \u2212 pi )Mam ,\nT n\u0304 = T exp(\u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndtH(t)) \u2212 1\n\n(17)\n\n(compare with Eq. (12)). Here | 0n\u0304p > is the state of the medium containing the n\u0304 with the\n4-momentum p, < f | denotes the annihilation products, N includes the normalization factors.\n\nFigure 2: (a) nn\u0304 transition in the medium followed by annihilation. The antineutron annihilation is shown by a circle. (b) Same as (a) but the antineutron propagator is dressed (see\ntext).\nThe definition of the annihilation amplitude Mam through Eqs. (17) is natural. If the number\nof particles of medium is equal to unity, Eq. (17) goes into (12). The annihilation width \u0393 is\nexpressed through Mam : \u0393 \u223c\n\nR\n\nd\u03a6 | Mam |2 . Since H appears only in the Mam , the antineutron\n\npropagator Gm\n0 is bare. In the next section we perform the rigorous calculation of M2 .\nIt is important that M2 \u223c Mam . The value of \u0393 and corrections to Mam (if they are possible)\nhave little effect on the results.\n\n7\n\n\fConstruct now the model with the dressed propagator (see Fig. 2b). In the Hamiltonian H\nwe separate out the real potential V = ReUn\u0304 \u2212 Un :\nH = V \u03a8\u0304n\u0304 \u03a8n\u0304 + H\u2032\n\n(18)\n\nand include it in the antineutron Green function\nm\nm\nGm = Gm\n0 + G0 V G0 + ... =\n\n1\n(1/Gm\n0 )\n\n1\n=\u2212 .\n\u2212V\nV\n\n(19)\n\nThen\nM2 = \u01ebGm Ma\u2032 ,\n\n(20)\n\nm\nGm Ma\u2032 = Gm\n0 Ma .\n\n(21)\n\nThe propagator Gm is dressed: \u03a3 = V 6= 0. According to (21), the expressions for the\npropagator and vertex function are uniquely connected (if HI is fixed). The \"amplitude\"\nMa\u2032 (V, H \u2032 ) should describe the annihilation. However, below is shown Ma\u2032 and model (20) are\nunphysical.\nWe recall the amplitude Ma involves all the n\u0304N interactions followed by annihilation including rescattering in the initial state. Similarly, Mam involves all the n\u0304-medium interactions\nfollowed by annihilation including the antineutron rescattering in the initial state. Compare\nnow the left- and right-hand sides of (21).\nFrom the physical point of view model (20) has no justification on the following reasons.\n1) If the number of particles of medium n is equal to unity, the model (20) does not describe\nthe free-space process (11) because Eq. (14) contains the bare propagator.\n2) The observable values (\u0393 for example) are expressed through Mam and not Ma\u2032 . Compared\nto Mam , Ma\u2032 is truncated because the portion of the Hamiltonian H is included in Gm . Ma\u2032 has\nnot a physical meaning.\n(The formal expression for the dressed propagator should contain the annihilation loops as\nwell. In this case the statements given in pp. 1) and 2) are only enhanced.)\n3) Equations (19) and (20) mean that the annihilation is turned on upon forming of the\nself-energy part \u03a3 = V (after multiple rescattering of n\u0304). This is counter-intuitive since at the\nlow energies [15-17]\n\nn\u0304p\n\u03c3ann\n> 2.5\n(22)\n\u03c3eln\u0304p\nand inverse picture takes place: in the first act of n\u0304-medium interaction the annihilation occurs.\n\nr=\n\nThe realistic competition between scattering and annihilation should be taken into account.\nBoth scattering and annihilation vertices should occur on equal terms in Mam or Gm . According\nto pp. 1) and 2) the latest possibility should be excluded. In line with the physical meaning of\nMam and M2 , the amplitude (16) allows for the above-mentioned effect (see Sect. 4.3).\n8\n\n\fThe structure with dressed propagator like (20) arises naturally if V and H\u2032 are the principally different terms and vertex function does not depend on V . In the problem under\nconsideration this is not the case. This is evident from the formal expansion of the T -operator\nT exp(\u2212i\n\nZ\n\ndx(V \u03a8\u0304n\u0304 \u03a8n\u0304 + H\u2032 )).\n\n(23)\n\nIt is significant that even the non-realistic model (20) gives reinforcement in comparison\nwith the potential model [5]:\nWa\n\u0393/2\npot = 1 +\nV\nWt\n\n!2\n\n>1\n\n(24)\n\nbecause for the model (20) the probability of process (2) is\nWa \u223c \u0393\n\n(25)\n\ninstead of Wtpot \u223c 1/\u0393.\nTo summarize, the introducing of dressed propagator Gm (energy gap) into process model\nentails an uncertainty of the vertex function Ma\u2032 . The all-important effect of the competition\nis not taken into account. The limiting case n = 1 is not reproduced. Ma\u2032 is unknown and\nunphysical.\nWe do not see the reasons for existence of field V which should be included into Gm and thus\nthe antineutron propagator is bare. For the process sown in Fig. 8b the propagator is bare as\nwell. Essentially, this fact is governing. Below we assume the definition (17) and consequently\nthe model with the bare propagator (16).\n\n4.2\n\nSimplest model\n\nThe fact that the antineutron propagator is bare is obvious in the model containing the annihilation vertex only. We consider Fig. 1a. Assume that\nHn\u0304N = \u03a6\u2217M ga \u03a8n\u0304 \u03a8N ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03a6M denotes the fields of mesons. The diagrams of the n\u0304N annihilation are shown in Fig.\n3.\nSimilarly, for the n\u0304-medium annihilation we take\nH = Ha =\n\nX\n\n\u03a6\u2217M ga \u03a8n\u0304 \u03a8Ni .\n\n(27)\n\ni\n\nThe corresponding diagrams are shown in Fig. 4.\nConsider now the process (2) using the same Hamiltonian Ha . The diagram is shown in\nFig. 5; the Hamiltonian is given by Eqs. (15), where H = Ha . The antineutron propagator is\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: n\u0304N annihilation. The interaction Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (26).\n\nFigure 4: Antineutron annihilation in the medium.\nbare. The questions connected with the self-energy part do not arise in principle because Ha\nmust appear only in the Tfn\u0304i (see Fig. 4). The block Tfn\u0304i is described by Eqs. (17) and (27).\nIn view of Eq. (22), the models like (27) are reasonable and so it seems obvious that the\nantineutron propagator is bare.\n\n4.3\n\nScattering and annihilation of n\u0304 in the intermediate state\n\nIn the low-density limit the relative annihilation probability of the intermediate antineutron r1\nis [15-17]\n\n\u03c3a\n> 0.7,\n(28)\n\u03c3t\n\u03c3t = \u03c3a + \u03c3s , where \u03c3a and \u03c3s are the cross sections of free-space n\u0304N annihilation and n\u0304N scatr1 =\n\ntering, respectively. The ratio (28) or (22) is very important for the correct model construction.\nThe model given above reproduces the magnitudes of r and r1 . Indeed, let us consider the\n10\n\n\fFigure 5: nn\u0304 transition in the medium followed by annihilation.\nfree-space process\nn + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N \u2192 f,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere f denotes n\u0304N or M. The annihilation and scattering channels are defined by (11) and\nn + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N,\n\n(30)\n\nrespectively. The corresponding diagrams are shown in Figs. 1b and 6a. Using the amplitude\n(14), the cross section of process (11) is found to be\n\u03c3anN\n\n=N\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd\u03a6 | M1b | = a N\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6 | Ma |2 = a2 \u03c3a ,\n\n(31)\n\na = \u01ebG0 . The normalization multiplier N is the same for \u03c3anN and \u03c3a .\n\nFigure 6: Free-space processes n + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N (Fig. a) and n + N \u2192 n\u0304 + N \u2192 n + N\n(Fig. b).\nFor process (30) the similar calculation gives\n\u03c3snN = a2 \u03c3s\n11\n\n(32)\n\n\fand correspondingly\n\n\u03c3a\n\u03c3anN\n=\n= r.\nnN\n\u03c3s\n\u03c3s\n\n(33)\n\nThe model (13) reproduces the ratio r.\nFor nn\u0304 transition in the medium r1 will be calculated by means of optical theorem. To\ncheck this calculation we obtain r1 for free-space process (29) by means of optical theorem as\nwell. The on-diagonal matrix element (see Fig. 6b) is\nM(0) = \u01ebG0 Ms (0)G0 \u01eb = a2 Ms (0),\n\n(34)\n\nwhere Ms (0) is the zero angle n\u0304N scattering amplitude. Let \u03c3tnN be the total cross section of\nprocess (29). Using the optical theorem in the left- and right-hand sides of (34), we get\n\u03c3tnN = a2 \u03c3t\n\n(35)\n\nand\n\n\u03c3anN\n\u03c3a\n=\n= r1 .\n(36)\nnN\n\u03c3t\n\u03c3t\nFor process (29) the relative probability of the annihilation channel is given by (28), as we\nwished prove.\nIn the medium instead of (11) and (29) one should consider the process (2) and inclusive\nnn\u0304 transition\n(n \u2212 medium) \u2192 (n\u0304 \u2212 medium) \u2192 fm ,\n\n(37)\n\nrespectively. Here fm denotes M or n\u0304. The result is the same (see Appendix A): for process\n(37) the relative annihilation probability of the intermediate n\u0304 is given by (28).\nRatio (28) is explicitly used only in the classical models like cascade one [18]. However, the\nHamiltonian should contain all the needed information, which allows the calculation of r or\nr1 . The fact that the model reproduces these ratios is very important; otherwise one can get\na wrong, additional suppression as in model (20). Since the potential model does not describe\nthe processes (11) and (2), it cannot reproduce (33) and (79).\nThe principal results of Sect. 4 are as follows. (a) The antineutron propagator is bare\nand singular. (b) In the low-density limit the ratio (28) should be reproduced. This can be\nconsidered as a necessary condition for the correct model construction. Model (15) satisfies\nthis requirement.\n\n5\n\nField-theoretical approach with finite time interval\n\nThe model must satisfy the following requirements: a) The S-matrix should be unitary. b)\nThe model should reproduce the free-space process shown in Fig. 1 and competition between\n12\n\n\fscattering and annihilation considered above. These conditions are obvious, however they are\nnot fulfilled in the potential model.\nThe interaction Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (15). We use the basis (n, n\u0304). The results\ndo not depend on the basis. A main part of existing calculations have been done in n \u2212 n\u0304\nrepresentation. The physics of the problem is in the Hamiltonian. The transition to the basis\nof stationary states is a formal step. It is possible only in the case of the potential model\nH = V =const., when the Hamiltonian of n\u0304-medium interaction is replaced by the effective\nmass H \u2192 meff = ReV \u2212 i\u0393/2. Since the calculation of process (2) will be done beyond the\npotential model, the procedure of diagonalization of mass matrix is unrelated to our problem.\nThe S-matrix amplitudes corresponding to Figs. 1b and 2a are singular as G0 \u223c 1/0 and\nGm\n0 \u223c 1/0. Contrary to quantum electrodynamics, the formal sum of series in \u01eb gives the\nmeaningless self-energy \u03a3 \u223c \u01eb2 /0. This is because the Hamiltonian Hnn\u0304 corresponds to 2-tail.\nThere is no compensation mechanism by radiative corrections.\nFor solving the problem the FTA is used [14]. It is infrared free. The calculation is performed\nby means of the evolution operator U(t, 0). The limiting transition t \u2192 \u221e is not made as it is\nphysically incorrect. The FTA can be used for any problem since for the nonsingular diagrams\nit converts to the S-matrix approach (see Sect. 6.1).\n\n5.1\n\nnn\u0304 transitions with n\u0304 in the final state\n\nFirst of all we consider the nn\u0304 transitions with n\u0304 in the final states on the finite time interval\n(t, 0) (see Fig. 7).\n\nFigure 7: nn\u0304 transition in the medium with n\u0304 in the final state.\nWe introduce the evolution operator U(t, 0) = I + iT (t, 0). In the lowest order in \u01eb the\n\n13\n\n\fmatrix element Tn\u0304n is given by\n< n\u03040 | U(t, 0) \u2212 I | 0n >= iTn\u0304n (t, 0) = \u2212i < n\u0304p 0 |\nT n\u0304 (t, tc ) = T exp(\u2212i\n\nZ\n\nt\ntc\n\ndt1 H(t1 )) \u2212 1 =\n\nt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\u0304\n\ndtc Hnn\u0304 (tc ) + T (t, 0)\n\n(\u2212i)k\n\nk=1\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ntc\n\ndt1 ...\n\nZ\n\ntk\u22121\n\ntc\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ntk\n\ndtc Hnn\u0304 (tc ) | 0np >,\n\ndtk H(t1 )...H(tk ),\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nwhere | 0np > and | 0n\u0304p > are the states of the medium containing the neutron and antineutron\nwith the 4-momentum p = (\u01ebn , pn ), respectively; T n\u0304 is the T -operator of n\u0304-medium interaction\n(compare with (17)).\nWe expand the \u03a8-operators in the eigenfunctions of unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 = \u2212\u22072 /2m+\nUn . Taking into account that Hnn\u0304 | 0np >= \u01eb | 0n\u0304p >, we change the order of integration [14]\nand obtain\nTn\u0304n (t, 0) = \u2212\u01ebt \u2212 \u01eb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ndtc iTiin\u0304 (t \u2212 tc ),\n\n(40)\n\niTiin\u0304 (\u03c4 ) =< n\u0304p 0 | T n\u0304 (\u03c4 ) | 0n\u0304p >,\nwhere \u03c4 = t \u2212 tc , T n\u0304 (\u03c4 ) = T n\u0304 (t, tc ). The n\u0304-medium interaction is separated out in the block\nTiin\u0304 (\u03c4 ). This equation is important since the structure of matrix element corresponding to the\nprocess (2) is similar (see (64)). On the other hand, Eq. (40) can be verified with the use of\nthe exactly solvable potential model.\n\n5.2\n\nVerification of FTA\n\nTo verify the FTA we obtain the results (5) and (6) of the potential model. As in Sect. 2, we\ntake H = V =const. The block Tiin\u0304 (\u03c4 ) is easily evaluated, resulting in\niTiin\u0304 (\u03c4 ) = Uiin\u0304 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1 = exp(\u2212iV \u03c4 ) \u2212 1.\n\n(41)\n\nThe probability of finding an n\u0304 is\nWn\u0304 (t, 0) =| Tn\u0304n (t, 0) |2 .\n\n(42)\n\nBy means of Eqs. (40) and (41) it is easy to verify that | Tn\u0304n (t, 0) |2 coincides with Eq. (5).\nThe total nn\u0304 transition probability Wt is given by\nWt (t, 0) = 1\u2212 | Uii (t, 0) |2\u2248 2ImTii (t, 0),\n\n(43)\n\nwhere Uii (t, 0) =< np 0 | U(t, 0) | 0np >. In the framework of the FTA the on-diagonal matrix\nelement Tii has been calculated in Ref. [14]:\nTii (t, 0) = i\u01eb2 t2 /2 \u2212 \u01eb2\n\nZ\n\nt\n0\n\n14\n\ndt\u03b1\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u03b1\n\ndtc Tiin\u0304 (t\u03b1 \u2212 tc ).\n\n(44)\n\n\fUsing Eqs. (41) and (44), one obtains that 2ImTii = Wtpot .\nConsequently, the FTA reproduces all the results of the potential model. This was to be\nexpected since one and the same Hamiltonian was used. The same is also true for any ab\ntransitions: nn\u0304, K 0 K\u0304 0 , neutrino oscillations. (The generalization for the relativistic case is\ntrivial.)\n\n5.3\n\nCancellation of divergences in the potential model\n\nThe consideration given above is infrared free. Let us return to the S-matrix problem formulation (\u221e, \u2212\u221e). Due to the zero momentum transfer in the \u01eb-vertex, any matrix element\ncontains the singular propagator (see Figs. 7 and 8a). However, the matrix element of potential\nmodel Tii obtained by means of S-matrix approach is not singular (see Eq. (9)). The same\nis true for the process shown in Fig. 7. From microscopic theory standpoint the reason is as\nfollows.\nIn addition to the singular propagator the matrix elements mentioned above also contain\nthe block Tiin\u0304 which is a sum of the zero angle rescattering diagrams of n\u0304. As a result, the selfenergy part \u03a3 = V appears. The corresponding mechanism of the cancellation of divergences\n(the forming of the self-energy part) is illustrated by Eq. (19), where Gm\n0 \u223c 1/0.\nWe are interesting in off-diagonal matrix elements which do not contain the sum mentioned\nabove (Tfn\u03046=i instead of Tiin\u0304 ) and hence diverges because one singular propagator after \u01eb-vertex\nappears in any case. (Recall that the formal sum of series in \u01eb gives the meaningless self-energy\npart \u03a3 \u223c \u01eb2 /0.)\nThe principal result of this section is that the FTA has been verified by the example of the\nexactly solvable potential model. It is involved in the block iTiin\u0304 (\u03c4 ) =< n\u0304p 0 | T n\u0304 (\u03c4 ) | 0n\u0304p > as a\nspecial case.\n\n6\n\nnn\u0304 transitions followed by annihilation\n\nAs shown above, the FTA reproduces all the potential model results. Besides, for non-singular\ndiagrams it converts to the S-matrix theory (see Sect. 6.1). We now proceed to the main\ncalculation.\nLet us consider the process (2) in nuclear matter (see Fig. 8a). The Hamiltonians H0 and\nHI (t) are the same as in Sect. 4. The 4-momenta of n and n\u0304 coincide. The T n\u0304 -operator involves\nall the n\u0304-medium interactions. In consequence of this \u03a3 = 0. In essence, we deal with 2-step\nnuclear decay: dynamical nn\u0304 conversion, annihilation. Its dynamical part last only 10\u221224 s.\nThe sole distinction with respect to the decay theory is that the FTA should be used because\n\n15\n\n\fthe antineutron propagator is singular.\n\nFigure 8: (a) nn\u0304 transition in the medium followed by annihilation. (b) Same as (a) but with\nescaping of particle in the nn\u0304 transition vertex.\nWe give the expressions for the amplitudes from Ref. [13]. Thereupon they will be obtained\nas a special case of a more general problem. The matrix element of the process shown in Fig.\n8a is\nTf i (t) = \u2212\u01eb\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\n\ndtc iTfn\u0304i (t, tc ),\n\niTfn\u0304i (t, tc ) = iTfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ) =< f | T n\u0304 (\u03c4 ) | 0n\u0304p > .\n\n(45)\n(46)\n\nHere Tfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ) is the matrix element of the antineutron annihilation in a time \u03c4 = t \u2212 tc (compare\nwith the matrix element of S-matrix (17)). The T n\u0304 (\u03c4 )-operator is given by (39). Similarly to\n(40), the n\u0304-medium annihilation is separated out in the block Tfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ).\nConsider now the more general problem. We calculate the matrix element Tf i (t) shown in\nFig. 8b on the interval (t/2, \u2212t/2). As a result, it will be shown that: (a) If q 6= 0 (q is the\n4-momentum of particle escaped in the nn\u0304 transition vertex) and t \u2192 \u221e, we come to the usual\nS-matrix amplitude. (b) If q \u2192 0, Eq. (45) is obtained. Such scheme allows to verify and\nstudy the FTA. Also we will see the point in which the standard calculation scheme should be\nchanged.\nConsider the imaginary free-space decay\nn \u2192 n\u0304 + \u03a6,\n\n(47)\n\n\u03a6(x) = N\u03a6 exp(\u2212iqx), N\u03a6 = (2q0 \u03a9)\u22121/2 .

We have obtained the usual S-matrix\namplitude, which is the verification of (50). As in (16), the antineutron propagator is bare.\nIt is easy to estimate the widths corresponding to Fig. 8b and free-space decay (47):\n\u03938b \u2248 \u01eb\u20322 \u0393/(2\u03c0 2),\n\u0393free \u2248 \u01eb\u20322 m\u03a6 /(2\u03c0),\n\n(59)\n\nwhere we have put m\u03a6 /m \u226a 1.

In (50) one should put \u01eb\u2032 = \u01eb and N\u03a6 = 1. Upon\nintegration with respect to k0 , Eq.

The result is expressed through the submatrix Tfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ). (Compare\nwith (40).) Note that Tf i (t) coincides with the second term of (40) with the replacement\n< i |=< n\u0304p 0 |\u2192< f |. This can be considered as a test for the Tf i (t).\nComparing Eqs. (64) and (57), one can see the formal correspondence: if q \u2192 0, GTfn\u0304i \u2192\ni\n\nRt\n\n7\n\n0\n\nd\u03c4 Tfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ).\n\nInfrared singularities and the formulation of the Smatrix problem\n\nIn this section we consider the time-dependence of matrix elements and other characteristic\nfeatures of the FTA and complete the calculation of process (2) (see also [13]).\nThe FTA is infrared-free. It naturally connected with the conditions of experiment. Indeed,\nmeasurement of any process corresponds to some interval \u03c4 . So it is necessary to calculate\nUf i (\u03c4 ). The replacement U(\u03c4 ) \u2192 S(\u221e) is justified if the main contribution gives some region\n\u2206 < \u03c4 , so that Uf i (\u03c4 > \u2206) = Uf i (\u221e) = Sf i =const. The expressions of this type are the basis\nfor all S-matrix calculations. The following cases are possible.\n1. There is bound to be asymptotic regime. Then the usual scheme realized in field theory\nor non-stationary theory of scattering takes place. Fig. 8b corresponds to this case.\n2. There is no asymptotic regime. An example is provided by oscillation hamiltonian Hnn\u0304 .\nWe have usual non-stationary problem. The S-matrix approach is inapplicable. Because of\nthis, for Fig. 8a the calculation has been done in the framework of FTA.\nA somewhat different explanation of application of the FTA is as follows. If HI = Hnn\u0304 ,\nthe solution is periodic. It is obtained by means of non-stationary equations of motion and not\n\n19\n\n\fS-matrix theory. This is clear from the S-matrix definition. To reproduce the limiting case\nH \u2192 0, i.e. the periodic solution, we have to use the FTA.\nLet us return to Eq. (64). The annihilation of n\u0304 in nuclear matter can be considered as\nthe decay of a one-particle state with the characteristic time \u03c4a . Correspondingly, Tfn\u0304i can be\ninterpreted as the decay matrix of the n\u0304-medium state. Obviously\nTfn\u0304i (\u03c4 > \u03c4a ) \u2248 Tfn\u0304i = const.\n\n(65)\n\nand\nW n\u0304 =\n\nX\n\n| Tfn\u0304i |2 = 1,\n\n(66)\n\nf 6=i\n\nwhere W n\u0304 is the total decay probability of the n\u0304-nucleus. Let\nt \u226b \u2206 \u2248 \u03c4a .\n\n(67)\n\nIn view of this condition the submatrix Tfn\u0304i can be calculated by means of S-matrix theory.\nThe FTA is needed only for description of the subprocess of the nn\u0304 conversion. However, the\ncondition (66) greatly simplifies the calculation. One can write immediately [13]\nWa (t) \u2248\n\nX\n\n| \u2212i\u01ebtTfn\u0304i |2 = \u01eb2 t2 W n\u0304 = \u01eb2 t2 = Wf (t),\n\n(68)\n\nf 6=i\n\nwhere Wa (t) is the probability of process (2).\nFor nn\u0304 transitions in nuclear Wt (t) = Wa (t) since all the n\u0304 annihilate. The interpretation\nof Wa (t) has been given above: momentary nn\u0304 conversion at some point in time between 0 and\nt; annihilation in a time \u03c4a \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u221224 s. The explanation of the t2 -dependence is simple. The\nprocess shown in Fig. 8a represents two consecutive subprocesses. The speed and probability\nof the whole process are defined by those of slower subprocess. Since \u03c4a \u226a t, the annihilation\ncan be considered instantaneous: for any t1 < t the annihilation probability is W n\u0304 (t \u2212 t1 ) \u2248 1.\nSo, the probability of process (2) is defined by the speed of nn\u0304 transition: Wa \u2248 Wf \u223c t2 ,\nbut not \u223c t/\u0393 (see Eq. (6)). In essence, we deal with the limiting case \u03c4 /t \u2192 0 or, similarly,\nTfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ) = Tfn\u0304i at any \u03c4 . Formally, the quadratic time-dependence follows from (64).\nOwing to annihilation channel, Wa is practically equal to the free-space nn\u0304 transition probability. So \u03c4nn\u0304 \u223c Tnn\u0304 , where Tnn\u0304 is the oscillation time of neutron bound in a nucleus.\nAll the results have been obtained by means of formal expansions. They are valid at any\nfinite t. Consequently, the singularities of the S-matrix amplitudes M1b and M2 result from the\nerroneus problem formulation. The problem should be formulated on the finite interval (t, 0).\nIf t \u2192 \u221e, Eq. (68) diverges just as the modulus (16) squared does. The infrared singularities\npoint to the fact that there is no asymptotic regime.\n20\n\n\f8\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nThe importance of unitarity condition is well known [19-21]. Nevertheless, the non-hermitian\nmodels are frequently used because on the one hand, they greatly simplify the calculation and\non the other hand, it is hoped that an error may be inessential. This paper demonstrates that\nthe non-unitarity of S-matrix can produce a qualitative error in the results. Certainly, the\nunitarity is a necessary and not sufficient condition. We compare our results and potential\nmodel one.\nThe time-dependence is a more important characteristic of any process. It is common\nknowledge that t-dependence of decay probability in the vacuum and medium is identical.\nEquations (60) illustrate this fact. In our calculation the t-dependencies coincide as well:\nWa \u223c Wt \u223c t2 and Wf \u223c t2 . The potential model gives Wtpot \u223c t, whereas Wf \u223c t2 . It is\nbeyond reason to such fundamental change.\nThe \u0393-dependence of the results differs fundamentally as well. The probability of the decay\nshown in Fig. 8b is linear in \u0393\nW8b = \u03938b t \u223c \u0393t\n\n(69)\n\n(see (59) and (60)). For Fig. 8a the annihilation effect acts in the same direction\nWa \u223c W n\u0304 \u223c \u0393.\n\n(70)\n\nIn the potential model the effect of absorption acts in the opposite direction Wtpot \u223c 1/\u0393.\nRecall that the annihilation is the basic effect determining the process speed (see (6) and (68)).\nLet us consider the suppression factor R. From Eq. (68) we have\nR=\n\nWa\n\u223c 1.\nWf\n\n(71)\n\nFor similar processes the value R \u223c 1 is typical. Indeed, in the medium the free-space decay\n(47) suppressed by the factor\n\u03938b\n\u0393\n1\n=\n\u2248 ,\n\u0393free\n\u03c0m\u03a6\n\u03c0\n\n(72)\n\nwhere we have put m\u03a6 \u2248 \u0393.\nThe realistic example is the pion production pn \u2192 pp\u03c0 \u2212 in vacuum and on neutron bound\nin a nucleus. If the pion energy is in the region of resonance, the pion absorption is very\nstrong. This effects on the number of pions emitted from the nucleus, but not on the fact of\npion formation inside the nucleus. (In the latter case the pion and products of pion absorption\nshould be detected).\nIn the processes cited above R \u223c 1. The potential model gives Rpot \u2192 0: if \u0393 \u223c 100 MeV\nand t \u223c 1 yr [22], Rpot \u223c 10\u221230 .\n21\n\n\fConsequently, in the potential model the t- and \u0393-dependencies are principally incorrect.\nAs a result, the suppression is enormous: Rpot \u2192 0. This is not surprising since the potential\nmodel describes only Wn\u0304 . Recall that in the strong absorption region Wn\u0304 \u226a Wa .\nThe next important point is the competition between scattering and annihilation in the\nintermediate state. The models (13) and (15) reproduce the values of r and r1 (see Sect. 4.3).\nSince the potential model does not describe the processes (2) and (11), it makes no sense to\nspeak about competition effect in this model. The greater the |ImV |, the greater an error in\nthe Wtpot and Wa calculated by means of potential model.\nConsider now the effects of coherent forward scattering and absorption. Let there is a forward scattering alone: H = ReV . Since the FTA reproduces all the potential model results (see\nSect. 5.2), it describes the above-mentioned special case as well, in particular, the suppression\nof oscillations by ReV .\nLet there is an annihilation vertex only: V = 0 and\nH = Ha .\n\n(73)\n\nThe annihilation Hamiltonian Ha is given by (27). In this case we inevitably arrive at the\namplitude with singular propagator. The dressed propagator cannot arise in principal (see\nSect. 4.2). In view of Eq. (22) the model (73) is reasonable and so the result Wa \u2248 Wf seems\nquite natural for us. In our calculation the approximation (73) has been not used. Nevertheless,\nthe result is the same as in model (73). In this connection we briefly outline the principal points\nof our calculation.\n\u2032\nThe process shown in Fig. 8b is described by the Hamiltonian HI = Hnn\u0304\n+ H. Since H\n\nappears in the block Tfn\u0304i only, the antineutron propagator is bare. For Fig. 8a the picture is\nthe same, however Tf i \u223c 1/0 (here we keep in mind the S-matrix problem formulation). Due\nto of this we had to use the FTA.\nThe fact that antineutron propagator is bare is principal. It entails the divergence of the\nS-matrix amplitude; the application of FTA; the linear time-dependence of the matrix element\nTf i (t) and t2 -dependence of the result. In our opinion the models with dressed (and consequently\nnon-singular) propagator are non-realistic (see Sect. 4).\n(Recall that in the potential model the antineutron propagator is dressed as \u03a3 = V by the\nmodel construction. Since this model is inapplicable, the field-theoretical approach is used.\nThe self-energy should be considered in the context of the concrete problem. Obviously, for\nFig. 8b the propagator is bare. For Fig. 8a it is bare as well because the n\u0304-medium interaction\nis the same.)\nAll the formulas up to (64) are true for any ab transitions in which ma = mb . (A generalizations for the relativistic case and the case when ma 6= mb are simple.) The next important point\n22\n\n\fis the condition (67). For nn\u0304 transitions in nuclei it is obvious because in this case the value\nt = T0 = 1.3 yr [22] is used (T0 is the observation time in a proton-decay type experiment).\nThe condition t \u226b \u03c4a leads to Eqs. (65) and (66). Due to of them the result does not depend\non a specific form of H and coincides with the result given by the model (73).\nOnce the antineutron annihilation amplitude is defined by (46), the rest of calculation\nis rather formal. The distinguishing features of the model is that the process amplitude is\n\"propotional\" to the annihilation amplitude Tf i \u223c Tfn\u0304i . This structure is typical for the direct\nprocesses.\nIf the condition t \u226b \u2206 is not fulfilled, the direct calculation of (64) is needed. However, the\nqualitative picture remains the same: the process amplitude is proportional to the absorption\namplitude.\nIt is interesting to study the behavior of Wt in the intermediate range t \u223c \u2206. It seems\nplausible that Wt depends slightly on the value of \u2206/t (in comparison with potential model\nresults). We also note that there is no asymptotic regime for free-space K 0 K\u0304 0 oscillations. In\nour opinion, it makes sense to look at the calculation of \u2206m = mL \u2212 mS (GIM mechanism)\nfrom the standpoint of applicability of S-matrix approach in this case (see Sect. 7).\n\n9\n\nConclusion\n\nThe approach considered above reproduces all the results on the particle oscillations (Sect.\n5.2). Certainly, for the problems where the absorption is inessential, the standard model of\noscillations is more handy since it is more simple. Our approach is oriented to the processes\nlike (1) which are not described by the potential model.\nThe direct calculation of nn\u0304 transitions in nuclear matter followed by annihilation has been\ndone. The results have been discussed in Sect. (8). We confirm our restriction [13] on the\nfree-space nn\u0304 oscillation time \u03c4nn\u0304 > 1016 yr. Compared to [13], the result (68) was obtained as\na special case of a more general problem. Besides, the medium corrections, the uncertainties\nrelated to amplitudes and competition between scattering and annihilation in the intermediate\nstate have been studied. The model (73) and analysis made in Sect. 4 show that \u03a3 = 0.\nNevertheless, this is a point of great nicety. The further investigations are desirable. The\nregion t < \u2206 and oscillations of another particles can be considered as well.\nThe calculation up to (64) is formal. With the replacement Tfn\u0304i (\u03c4 ) \u2192 Tfbi (\u03c4 ), where Tfbi\nis the b-particle absorption amplitude, the matrix element (64) describes the process (1) in\nwhich ma = mb . In this connection we point out some features of Eq. (64). a) The amplitude\nTf i (t) is \"proportional\" to the amplitude Tfbi (\u03c4 ). In the potential model the effect of b-particle\nabsorption acts in the opposite direction, which tends to suppress the process. b) In the lowest\n23\n\n\forder in \u01eb the potential model gives the linear t-dependence Wtpot \u223c t/\u0393. For any block Tfbi (\u03c4 )\nmodel the time-dependence of the value | Tf i (t) |2 cannot be linear.\nAlso we would like to emphasize that for a processes with zero momentum transfer the\nproblem should be formulated on the finite time interval.\nAppendix A\nIn this appendix the relative annihilation probability of the intermediate n\u0304 for nn\u0304 transition in\nthe medium is calculated. Similarly to (31), we obtain the probability of process (2) in a unit\nof time\n\u03932 = N1\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6 | M2 |2 = a2m N1\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6 | Mam |2 = a2m \u0393,\n\n(74)\n\nam = \u01ebGm\n0 . The normalization multiplier N1 is the same for \u03932 and \u0393. The term \"width\" is\nunused because the t-dependence of process (2) does not need to be exp(\u2212\u03932 t) (see Sect. 7).\nIn the low-density approximation [23,24] \u0393 = v\u03c1\u03c3a and\n\u03932 = a2m v\u03c1\u03c3a .\n\n(75)\n\nThe on-diagonal matrix element M m (0) corresponding to the process (n \u2212 medium) \u2192 (n\u0304 \u2212\nmedium) \u2192 (n \u2212 medium) is\nm\nm\n2\nm\nM m (0) = \u01ebGm\n0 Ms (0)G0 \u01eb = am Ms (0)\n\n(76)\n\n(compare with (34)).

The neutron and antineutron\nare assumed spinless. We have\n\u03a8n (x) | np >= \u03a8n (x)b+ (p) | 0 >= Nn e\u2212ipx | 0 >,\n24\n\n(80)\n\n\f< \u03a6q | \u03a6\u2217 (x) =< 0 | N\u03a6 eiqx .\n\n(81)\n\n< \u03a6q | \u03a6\u2217 (xc )\u03a8n\u0304 (xc ) | np >= Nn N\u03a6 ei(q\u2212p)xc .\n\n(82)\n\nThen\n\nIn the last multiplier of Eq. (49) we separate out the antineutron field operator \u03a8n\u0304 (xk ):\nH(tk ) =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd xk H(xk ) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 xk H\u2032 (xk )\u03a8n\u0304 (xk ).\n\n(83)\n\nEquation (49) becomes\n\u2032\n\nTf i (t) = \u2212i\u01eb Nn N\u03a6 < f 0 |\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u2212i)Tk\u22121 (t)\n\nk=1\n\nJ(tk ) =\n\nZ\n\ntk\n\u2212t/2\n\ndtc\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\ntk\u22121\n\n\u2212t/2\n\ndtk\n\nZ\n\nd3 xk H\u2032 (xk )J(tk ) | 0 >,\n\nd3 xc < T (\u03a8n\u0304 (xk )\u03a8\u0304n\u0304 (xc )) > ei(q\u2212p)xc .\n\n(84)\n\n(85)\n\nFor Fig. 8a the problem is non-relativistic and so for Fig. 8b we also take the non-relativistic\nantineutron propagator\n< T (\u03a8n\u0304 (xk )\u03a8\u0304n\u0304 (xc )) >= iG(xk \u2212 xc ) = i\n\nZ\n\ndk0 \u2212ik0 (tk \u2212tc )\ne\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\neik(xk \u2212xc )\n.\n(2\u03c0)3 k0 \u2212 mn\u0304 \u2212 k2 /2mn\u0304 + i0\n(86)\n\nUpon integrating over xc and k we obtain Eqs.
