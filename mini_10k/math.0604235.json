For any unexplained notation and terminology we refer the reader\nto [Ma].\nRecall that a local noetherian ring R is equidimensional if dim(R) = dim(R/P )\nfor all minimal primes P of R, and thus a noetherian ring R is said to be locally\nequidimensional if Rm is equidimensional for every maximal ideal m of R. We\nwill use R\u25e6 to denote the complement of the union of the minimal primes of R.\nLet R be a noetherian ring and I be an ideal I. For a R-module M , we\nwill write HiI (M ) for the i-th local cohomology module of M with support\nin V(I) = {P \u2208 Spec(R) | P \u2287 I}. We will say an element x of R\u25e6 is a\nuniform local cohomological annihilator of R, if for every maximal ideal m, x\nkills Him (R) for all i less than the height of m. Moreover, we say that x is\na strong uniform local cohomological annihilator of R if x is a uniform local\ncohomological annihilator of RP for every non minimal prime ideal P of R.\nIt is well known that a nonzero local cohomology module is rarely finitely generated, even the annihilators of it are not known in general. On the other hand,\nit has been discovered by Hochster and Huneke that the existence of a uniform\nlocal cohomological annihilator is of great importance in solving the problems\nsuch as the existence big Cohen-Macaulay algebras [HH2] and a uniform ArtinRees theorem [Hu]. So it is very interesting to find out more noetherian rings\ncontaining uniform local cohomological annihilators.\nA traditional way of studying uniform local cohomological annihilators is\nto make use of the dualizing complex over a local ring. Roberts initiated this\nmethod in [Ro]. By means of this technique Hochster and Huneke [HH1] prove\nthat if a locally equidimensional noetherian ring R is a homomorphic image\nof a Gorenstein ring of finite dimension, then R has a strong uniform local\ncohomological annihilator. It is known not every local ring has a dualizing\ncomplex, however, by passing to completion, Hochster and Huneke [HH2] show\nthat an unmixed, equidimensional excellent local ring has a strong uniform local\ncohomological annihilator.\nIt is worth noting that a lot of results concerning the annihilators of local\ncohomology modules have been established in recent years. Let us recall some\n\n1\n\n\fnotions before we state these achievements. One can refer to [BS] for details.\nGiven ideals I, J in a noetherian ring R and a R-modules M , we set\n\u03bbJI (M ) = inf{depth(MP ) + ht(I + P/P ) | P \u2208 Spec(R) \\ V(J)}\nfIJ (M ) = inf{i | J n HiI (M ) 6= 0 for all positive integers n}.\nWe will say that the Annihilator Theorem for local cohomology modules holds\nover R if \u03bbJI (M ) = fIJ (M ) for every choice of the finitely generated R-module\nM and for every choice of ideals I, J of R. We also say that the Local-global\nPrinciple for the annihilation of local cohomology modules holds over R if\nJRP\nfIJ (M ) = inf{fIR\n(MP ) | P \u2208 Spec(R)} holds for every choice of ideals I, J of\nP\nR and for every choice of the finitely generated R-module M .\nFaltings [Fa1] established that the Annihilator Theorem for cohomology\nmodules holds over R if R is a homomorphic image of a regular ring or R has a\ndualizing complex. In [Ra2], Raghavan proved that the Local-global Principle\nfor the annihilation of local cohomology modules holds over R if R is a homomorphic image of a regular ring. More recently, Khashyarmanesh and Salarian\n[KS] obtained that the Annihilator Theorem and the Local-global Principle\nfor cohomology modules hold over a homomorphic image of a (not necessarily\nfinite-dimensional) Gorenstein ring.\nClearly, if the Annihilator Theorem holds over a ring R, one can use it to\nprove the existence of some annihilator xm of the local cohomology modules\ni\nHm\n(R) for each maximal ideal m. However, the element xm may be dependent\non the choice of the maximal ideal m. Raghavan [Ra1, Theorem 3.1] established\na interesting uniform annihilator theorem of local cohomology modules which\nstates that if R is a homomorphic image of a biequidimensional regular ring\nof finite dimension and M a finitely generated R-module, then there exists a\npositive integer k (depending only on M ) such that for any ideals I, J of R, we\nhave J k HiI (M ) = 0 for i < \u03bbJI (M ).\nNote that, in all the results mentioned above, the ring considered must\nbe, at least, a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring. In this paper, we\nfirst study the properties of the rings containing uniform local cohomological\nannihilators. It turns out that all these rings should be universally catenary and\nlocally equidimensional (Theorem 2.1). Due to this fact, we are able to show that\na power of a uniform local cohomological annihilator is a strong uniform local\ncohomological annihilator (Theorem 2.2). We will establish a useful criterion for\nthe existence of uniform local cohomological annihilators. An easy consequence\nof one of our main results shows that if a locally equidimensional noetherian ring\nR of positive dimension is a homomorphic image of a Cohen-Macaulay (abbr.\nCM ) ring of finite dimension or an excellent local ring, then R has a uniform\nlocal cohomological annihilator. This greatly generalizes a lot of known results.\nEspecially, it gives a positive answer to a conjecture of Huneke [Hu, Conjecture\n2.13] in the local case.\n\n2\n\n\fThe technique of the paper is different from the technique used by Roberts\n[Ro]. The point of our technique is that a uniform local cohomological annihilator of a ring R may be chosen only dependent on the dimension of R and the\nmultiplicity of each minimal prime ideal of R. One of our main results of the\npaper is the following theorem, which essentially reduces the property that a\nring R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator to the same property for\nR/P for all minimal prime P of R. Explicitly:\nTheorem 3.2. Let R be a noetherian ring of finite dimension d > 0. Then the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\n(i) R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator.\n(ii) R is locally equidimensional, and R/P has a uniform local cohomological\nannihilator for each minimal prime ideal P of R.\nIn section 4, we discuss the uniform local cohomological annihilators for\nexcellent rings. The main result of this section is the following, which shows\nthat the conjecture of Huneke [Hu, Conjecture 2.13] is valid if the dimension of\nthe ring considered is no more than 5.\nTheorem 4.6.\nLet R be a locally equidimensional excellent ring of\ndimension d > 0. If d \u2264 5, then R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator.\n\n2\n\nBasic properties\n\nNow we begin with studying the properties of a noetherian ring R containing a\nuniform local cohomological annihilator. Quite unexpectedly, it turns out that\nR must be locally equidimensional and universally catenary.\nLet R be a noetherian ring. For a maximal ideal m of R, one can see easily\nfrom the definition of local cohomology that\nHimRm (Rm ) = Him (R)\nfor i \u2265 0. If x is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R, then Him (R) = 0\nfor every maximal ideal m with x \u2208\n/ m and i < ht(m). So, for such a maximal\nideal m, Rm is CM , and thus Rx is a CM ring.\nTheorem 2.1 Let R be a noetherian and x \u2208 R\u25e6 a uniform local cohomological\nannihilator of R. Then\n(i) R is locally equidimensional.\n(ii) R is universally catenary.\nProof. (i) Suppose that, on the contrary, R is not locally equidimensional. It\nimplies that there exists a maximal ideal m of R, and a minimal prime ideal\nP contained in m such that ht(m/P ) < ht(m). Replacing R by Rm , we can\nassume R is a local ring and m is the unique maximal ideal of R. Let\n0 = q \u2229 q2 \u2229 * * * \u2229 qr\n3\n\n\fdenote a shortest primary decomposition of the zero ideal of R, where q is P primary. By the choice of P and m, it is clear, r > 1. So we can choose an\nelement y \u2208\n/ P such that yq = 0. Consequently yHim (q) = 0 for i \u2265 0.\nConsider the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 q \u2192 R \u2192 R/q \u2192 0.\nIt induces the following long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Him (R) \u2192 Him (R/q) \u2192 Hi+1\nm (q) \u2192 * * * .\nSince xHim (R) = 0 for i < ht(m), we conclude xyHim (R/q) = 0 for i < ht(m).\nIn particular, we have\nxyHem (R/q) = 0\n(2.1)\nwhere e = ht(m/q). As xy is a non zero-divisor for R/q, the sequence\nxy\n\n0 \u2192 R/q \u2192 R/q \u2192 R/(q + (xy)) \u2192 0\nis a short exact sequence of R-modules. So we have an exact sequence\nxy\n\nHem (R/q) \u2192 Hem (R/q) \u2192 Hem (R/(q + (xy))).\nNote that dim(R/(q + (xy))) = e \u2212 1. Hence Hem (R/(q + (xy))) = 0 by [Gr,\nxy\nProposition 6.4]. It shows the morphism Hem (R/q) \u2192 Hem (R/q) is surjective.\nThus\nHem (R/q) = 0\nby (2.1), but this is impossible by [Gr, Proposition 6.4] again. Therefore R is\nlocally equidimensional.\n(ii) To prove the conclusion, it suffices to prove Rm is universally catenary\nfor every maximal ideal m. So we can assume that R a local ring and m is the\nunique maximal ideal of R. By a theorem of Ratliff (see [Ma, Theorem 15.6]),\nit is enough to prove R/P is universally catenary for every minimal prime ideal\nP.\nFor a fixed minimal prime ideal P , let\n0 = q \u2229 q2 \u2229 * * * \u2229 qr\ndenote a shortest primary decomposition of the zero ideal of R, where q is P primary. If r = 1, x is a non zero-divisor of R. Clearly, x is also a uniform\nlocal cohomological annihilator of R\u0302, where R\u0302 is the m-adic completions of R.\nHence by (i), R\u0302 is equidimensional. It follows from another theorem of Ratliff\n(see [Ma, Theorem 31.7]) that R is universally catenary.\nIf r > 1, choose an element y \u2208\n/ P as in the proof (i) such that xy is\na non zero-divisor of R/q and so the image of xy in R/q is a uniform local\ncohomological annihilator of R/q. Just as in the case r = 1, we assert that R/q\nis universally catenary, and consequently, R/P is universally catenary. This\nproves (ii).\n4\n\n\fIt is easy to see that a strong uniform local cohomological annihilator of a\nnoetherian R is also a uniform local cohomological annihilator. Conversely, we\nhave:\nTheorem 2.2 Let R be a noetherian ring of finite dimension d and x be a\nuniform local cohomological annihilator of R. Then a power of x is a strong\nuniform local cohomological annihilator of R.\nProof. First of all, we assume that R is a unmixed local ring with the maximal\nideal m. Let R\u0302 denote the completion of R with respect to m. As x is not\ncontained in any minimal prime ideal of R and R is unmixed, x must be a non\nzero-divisor of R, and so x is a non zero-divisor of R\u0302. Hence the element x is\ni\ni\nnot contained in any minimal prime ideal of R\u0302. Since Hm\n(R) \u2243 Hm\n(R\u0302) for all\nR\u0302\ni\ni, it shows xHm\n(R\u0302) = 0 for i < d. Therefore we conclude that x is a uniform\nR\u0302\n\nlocal cohomological annihilator of R\u0302.\nAccording to Cohen Structure Theorem for complete ring, one can write\nR\u0302 = S/I, where S is a Goreinstein local ring of dimension d. By local duality,\nwe have xExtiS (R\u0302, S) = 0 for i > 0. Hence\nxExtiSQ (R\u0302Q , SQ ) = 0\nfor every prime ideal Q of S and i > 0. By local duality again, we conclude that\nfor every non minimal prime ideal Q\u0304 of R\u0302,\nxHiQ\u0304 (R\u0302Q\u0304 ) = 0\nfor i < ht(Q\u0304).\nLet P be an arbitrary non minimal prime ideal of R. Set ht(P ) = r. We can\nchoose elements x1 , x2 , * * * , xr contained in P such that ht(x1 , x2 , * * * , xr ) =\nr. Set I = (x1 , x2 , * * * , xr ). Since dim(R\u0302/I R\u0302) = dim(R/I), it is clear that\ndim(R\u0302/I R\u0302) = d \u2212 r. By Theorem 2.1, R\u0302 is equidimensional, and so ht(I R\u0302) = r.\nIt follows from [HH1, Theorem 11.4 (b)] that for every i \u2265 1 and for all t > 0\nd\n\nx2\n\n\u22121\n\nHi (xt1 , xt2 , * * * , xtr ; R\u0302) = 0\n\nwhere Hi (xt1 , xt2 , * * * , xtr ; R\u0302) denotes the Koszul homology group.\nd\nSince R\u0302 is faithfully flat over R, we have x2 \u22121 Hi (xt1 , xt2 , * * * , xtr ; R) = 0 for\nd\nevery i \u2265 1 and for all t > 0. Hence, we obtain x2 \u22121 HiI (R) = 0 for i < r. In\nparticular\nd\nd\nx2 \u22121 HiP RP (RP ) = x2 \u22121 (HiI (R))P = 0.\nd\n\nTherefore x2 \u22121 is a strong uniform local cohomological annihilator of R.\nSecondly, we assume that R is a unmixed ring. By the above proof of the\nlocal case, we have for any maximal ideal m of R and any prime ideal P \u2286 m,\ndm \u22121\n\nx2\n\nHiP RP (RP ) = 0\n5\n\n\ffor i < htP , where dm stands for the dimension of the local ring Rm . Since\nd\ndm \u2264 d for every maximal ideal m, we conclude that x2 \u22121 is a strong uniform\nlocal cohomological annihilator of R.\nFinally, we assume that R is not a unmixed ring. Let P1 , P2 , * * * , Pr be all\nthe distinct minimal prime ideals of R. Let\n0 = q1 \u2229 q2 \u2229 * * * \u2229 qr \u2229 qr+1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 qt\ndenote a shortest primary decomposition of the zero ideal of R, where qi is Pi primary for i \u2264 r. Clearly, t > r. Set I = q1 \u2229q2 \u2229* * *\u2229qr , and S = R/I. Since x\nis a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R, it implies that Him (R) = 0 for\nany maximal ideal m with x \u2208\n/ m and i < ht(m), i.e. Rx is CM . Hence x must\nbe contained in every embedded associated primes of R. From this fact, one\ncan choose a positive integer n1 such that xn1 \u2208 qj for all j with r + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 t.\nSo xn1 I = 0. Replacing x by xn1 , we may assume that xI = 0. Thus\nxHiP RP (IP ) = 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor all i and for all prime ideals P of R.\nConsider the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 I \u2192 R \u2192 S \u2192 0.\n\n(2.3)\n\nFor any maximal ideal m of R, we have the following long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Him (R) \u2192 Him (S) \u2192 Hi+1\nm (I) \u2192 * * * .\nBy the definition of a uniform local cohomological annihilator and (2.2), we\nconclude that x2 Him (S) = 0 for i < ht(m). Let m\u0304 to denote the image of m in\nS, we have ht(m) = ht(m\u0304) by Theorem 2.1. So x2 Him\u0304 (S) = 0 for any maximal\nideal m\u0304 of S and for i < ht(m\u0304). Hence the image of x2 in S is a uniform\nlocal cohomological annihilator of S. Clearly, S is unmixed. By the unmixed\ncase proved above, we assert that there exists a positive integer n2 such that\nthe image of x2n2 in S is a strong uniform local cohomological annihilator of\nS. Replacing x by x2n2 , we may assume that the image of x in S is a strong\nuniform local cohomological annihilator of S.\nLet P be an arbitrary prime ideal of R. We use P\u0304 to denote the image of P\nin S. By Theorem 2.1, we have ht(P ) = ht(P\u0304 ). Hence by the choice of x, we\nconclude that\n(2.4)\nxHPi RP (SP ) = 0\nfor i < ht(P ). Localizing the short exact sequence (2.3) at P , it induces the\nfollowing long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 HiP RP (IP ) \u2192 HiP RP (RP ) \u2192 HiP RP (SP ) \u2192 * * * .\nHence it follows from (2.2) and (2.4) that x2 HiP RP (RP ) = 0 for i < ht(P ).\nTherefore x2 is a strong uniform local cohomological annihilator of R, and this\nends the proof of the theorem.\n6\n\n\f3\n\nEquivalent conditions\n\nIn this section, we will prove one of our main result, which essentially reduces the\nproperty that a ring R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator to proving\nthe same property for R/P for all minimal primes of R. This reducing process is\nvery useful, it enable us to find a uniform local cohomological annihilator more\neasily and directly. Now, before we prove the main result of this section, we\nneed a lemma which will play a key role in the rest of the section.\nLemma 3.1 Let (R, m) be a noetherian local ring of dimension d , and P be a\nminimal prime ideal of R. Let\n0 \u2192 R/P \u2192 R \u2192 N1 \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 R/P \u2192 N1 \u2192 N2 \u2192 0\n\n(3.1)\n\n***\n0 \u2192 R/P \u2192 Nt\u22121 \u2192 Nt \u2192 0\nbe a series of short exact sequences of finitely generated R-modules. Let y be an\nelement of R such that yNt = 0.\n(i) If there is an element x of R such that xHim (R) = 0 for i < d, then\nd\u22121\n(xy)t Him (R/P ) = 0 for i < d.\n(ii) If there is an element x of R such that xHim (R/P ) = 0 for i < d, then\nt\nx yHim (R) = 0 for i < d.\nProof. Since R is , we have d > 0.\n(i) By the choice of y, it implies\nyHim (Nt ) = 0\n\n(3.2).\n\nfor all i \u2265 0. We will use induction on i to prove\ni\n\n(xy)t Him (R/P ) = 0\nholds for 0 \u2264 i < d.\nFor i = 0, it is trivial because H0m (R/P ) = 0. Now, for 0 < i < d, Suppose\nthat we have proved\ni\u22121\n(xy)t Hi\u22121\n(3.3)\nm (R/P ) = 0.\nSet k = ti\u22121 . Let us consider the long exact sequence of local cohomology\nderived from the last short exact sequence in (3.1):\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\n* * * \u2192 Hi\u22121\nm (R/P ) \u2192 Hm (Nt\u22121 ) \u2192 Hm (Nt ) \u2192 * * * .\nk\n\nBy (3.2) and (3.3), it follows (xy) yHi\u22121\nm (Nt\u22121 ) = 0. Continue the process, one\ncan prove (xy)jk yHi\u22121\nm (Nt\u2212j ) = 0 for j = 1, 2, * * * , t \u2212 1. Hence by the long\nexact sequence of local cohomology derived from the first short exact sequence\nin (3.1):\ni\ni\n* * * \u2192 Hi\u22121\nm (N1 ) \u2192 Hm (R/P ) \u2192 Hm (R) \u2192 * * *\n7\n\n\fand the condition xHim (R) = 0, we have (xy)(t\u22121)k+1 Him (R/P ) = 0. It easy to\ni\ncheck, ti \u2265 (t \u2212 1)k + 1, so it follows that (xy)t Him (R/P ) = 0. This completes\nd\u22121\nthe inductive proof. In particular, we have proved (xy)t Him (R/P ) = 0 for\ni < d.\n(ii) By the condition, we have\nxHim (R/P ) = 0\n\n(3.4)\n\nfor i < d. Set R = N0 .\nNow, we will use induction on j to prove that\nxj yHim (Nt\u2212j ) = 0 for i < d\nhold for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 t.\nFor j = 0, it is trivial by (3.2). For j > 0, suppose that we have proved\nxj\u22121 yHim (Nt\u2212(j\u22121) ) = 0\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor i < d.\nConsider the t \u2212 (j \u2212 1)-th short exact sequence in (3.1), it induces the\nfollowing long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Him (R/P ) \u2192 Him (Nt\u2212j ) \u2192 Him (Nt\u2212(j\u22121) ) \u2192 * * * .\nBy (3.4) and (3.5), we conclude\nxj yHim (Nt\u2212j ) = 0\nfor i < d. This completes the inductive proof. In particular, we have xt yHim (R) =\n0 for i < d.\nWe are now ready to prove our main result of the section.\nTheorem 3.2 Let R be a noetherian ring of finite dimension d > 0. Then the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent:\n(i) R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator.\n(ii) R is locally equidimensional, and R/P has a uniform local cohomological\nannihilator for each minimal prime ideal P of R.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii) The first conclusion of (ii) comes from Theorem 2.1. Let P be\nan arbitrary minimal prime ideal of R. Let x be a uniform local cohomological\nannihilator of R. Put t = l(RP ). It is easy to see that there exist finitely\ngenerated R-modules N1 , N2 , * * * , Nt such that\n(1) N1 , N2 , * * * , Nt fit into a series of the following short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 R/P \u2192 R \u2192 N1 \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 R/P \u2192 N1 \u2192 N2 \u2192 0\n***\n8\n\n(3.6)\n\n\f0 \u2192 R/P \u2192 Nt\u22121 \u2192 Nt \u2192 0\n(2) there exists an element y \u2208 R \\ P , yNt = 0.\nd\u22121\nClearly, (xy)t\nis not contained in P . We will show that the image of\nd\u22121\n(xy)t\nin R/P is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R/P . Since R\nis locally equidimensional,, we have ht(m/P ) = ht(m) for every maximal ideal\nm with m \u2287 P . Thus it suffices to prove that, for every maximal ideal m with\nm\u2287P\nd\u22121\n\n(xy)t\n\nHimRm ((R/P )m ) = 0\n\nfor i < ht(m).\nLocalizing the short exact sequences in (3.6) at m, we obtain the following\nthe short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 (R/P )m \u2192 Rm \u2192 (N1 )m \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 (R/P )m \u2192 (N1 )m \u2192 (N2 )m \u2192 0\n***\n0 \u2192 (R/P )m \u2192 (Nt\u22121 )m \u2192 (Nt )m \u2192 0.\nBy the choice of x, we have xHimRm (Rm ) = 0 for i < ht(m). Clearly,\ne\u22121\ny(Nt )m = 0. Hence by Lemma 3.1 (i), we conclude (xy)t HimRm ((R/P )m ) = 0\nfor i < e, where e = ht(m). Therefore for every maximal ideal m with m \u2287 P ,\nwe have\nd\u22121\n(xy)t HimRm ((R/P )m ) = 0\nd\u22121\n\nfor i < ht(m). Hence the image of (xy)t\nin R/P is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R/P , and this proves (i) \u21d2 (ii).\n(ii) \u21d2 (i) Let P1 , P2 , * * * , Pr be all the distinct minimal prime ideals of\nR. For each j 1 \u2264 j \u2264 r, Put l(RPj ) = tj . For a fixed j, It is easy to see\n(j)\n(j)\nthat there exist finitely generated R-modules N1 , N (j)2 , * * * , Ntj satisfying\nthe following two properties:\n(j)\n(j)\n(j)\n(1) N1 , N2 , * * * , Ntj fit into a series of the following short exact sequences\n(j)\n\n0 \u2192 R/Pj \u2192 R \u2192 N1\n(j)\n\n0 \u2192 R/Pj \u2192 N1\n\n\u21920\n\n(j)\n\n\u2192 N2\n\n\u21920\n\n(3.7)\n\n***\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n0 \u2192 R/Pj \u2192 Ntj \u22121 \u2192 Ntj \u2192 0\n(2) There exists an element yj \u2208 R \\ P such that yj Ntj = 0. and yj lies in\nall Pk except Pj .\nTo prove the conclusion, it is enough to find an element x \u2208 R\u25e6 , such that\nfor every maximal ideal m\nxHimRm (Rm ) = 0\n9\n\n\ffor i < ht(m).\nBy the condition, for each j, there exists an element xj \u2208\n/ Pj such that\nits image in R/Pj is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R/Pj . Set\nP tj\nx=\nxj yj . It is easy to check x lies in no minimal prime ideal of R. We will\nprove that x is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R.\nLet m be an arbitrary non minimal prime ideal of R. Put e = ht(m). For a\nfixed j, localizing the short exact sequences (3.7) at m, we obtain the following\nshort exact sequences\n(j)\n\n0 \u2192 (R/Pj )m \u2192 Rm \u2192 (N1 )m \u2192 0\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n0 \u2192 (R/Pj )m \u2192 (N1 )m \u2192 (N2 )m \u2192 0\n***\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n0 \u2192 (R/Pj )m \u2192 (Ntj \u22121 )m \u2192 (Ntj )m \u2192 0\n(j)\n\nand it is clear yj (Ntj )m = 0.\nIf m contains Pj , we have ht(m/Pj ) = e by the assumption that R is locally\nequidimensional. Thus by the choice of xj ,\nxj HimRm ((R/Pj )m ) = 0\n\n(3.8)\n\nfor i < e. If m does not contain Pj , the statement (3.8) holds trivially. Hence\nby Lemma 2.2 (ii), we conclude that\nxtj yj HimRm (Rm ) = 0\n\n(3.9)\n\nfor i < e. Therefore, by the choice of x, we have\nxHimRm (Rm ) = 0, for i < ht(m)\nholds for every maximal ideal m of R. So x is a uniform local cohomological\nannihilator of R. This proves (ii) \u21d2 (i).\nNow, we end this section by an interesting corollary, which is not known in\nsuch a extent even in the local case.\nCorollary 3.3 Let R be a locally equidimensional noetherian ring of finite positive dimension. Then R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator in any\none of the following cases:\n(i) R is the homomorphic image of a CM ring of finite dimension.\n(ii) R is an excellent local ring.\nProof. (i) Represent R as R = S/I, where S is a CM ring of finite dimension\nand I an ideal of S. By Theorem 3.2, it suffices to prove that for any minimal\nprime ideal P of R, R/P has a uniform local cohomological annihilator. Let Q\nbe the prime ideal of S such that P = Q/I. It suffices to prove that S/Q has a\nuniform local cohomological annihilator.\n10\n\n\fSet n = ht(Q). If n = 0, then Q is a minimal prime ideal of S. Note\nthat 1 is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of S, the conclusion follows\nimmediately from Theorem 3.2.\nAssume that n > 0. Since S is CM , we can choose a regular sequence\nx1 , x2 , * * * , xn contained in Q. Thus S/(x1 , x2 , * * * , xn ) is still a CM ring. It is\nobvious that Q/(x1 , x2 , * * * , xn ) is a minimal prime ideal of S/(x1 , x2 , * * * , xn ).\nThus from the case n = 0, we assert S/Q has a uniform local cohomological\nannihilator by Theorem 3.2.\n(ii) By [HH2, Lemma 3.2], every excellent local domain has a strong uniform local cohomological annihilator, and thus R has a strong uniform local\ncohomological annihilator by Theorem 3.2.\n\n4\n\nUniform local cohomological annihilators of\nexcellent rings\n\nIn this section, we restrict our discussion to the uniform local cohomological\nannihilators of excellent rings. By two theorems of Hochster and Huneke [HH1,\nTheorem 11.3, 11.4], it is easy to see that Huneke's conjecture [Hu, Conjecture\n2.13] is valid if every locally equidimensional excellent noetherian ring R of finite\ndimension has a strong uniform local cohomological annihilator. Since for each\npositive integer n, the Koszul complex of every sequence xn1 , xn2 , * * * , xnk in R\nwith ht(x1 , x2 , * * * , xk ) = k is a complex satisfies the standard conditions on\nheight and rank in the sense of [Hu, (2.11)], it is easy to see that the converse\nof this result is also true. Due to Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 3.2, Huneke's\nconjecture is equivalent to the following:\nConjecture 4.1 Let R be an excellent noetherian domain of finite dimension.\nThen R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator.\nThe conjecture is known to be true if R is an excellent normal domain of dimension d \u2264 3 [Hu,Proposition 4.5(vii)]. We will prove that Conjecture 4.1 is\ntrue for the ring R with dim(R) \u2264 5. In order to prove the main result of this\nsection, we need the following result established by Goto[Go, Theorem 1.1].\nProposition 4.2 Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d and x is an element\nof m with (0 : x) = (0 : x2 ). Then the following conditions are equivalent.\n(i) R/xn R is a CM ring of dimension d \u2212 1 for every integer n > 0.\n(ii) R/x2 R is a CM ring of dimension d \u2212 1.\nAnother important result we need is the following explicit version of\nCorollary 3.3 (ii), which follows from [HH2, Lemma 3.2].\nProposition 4.3 Let (R, m) be an excellent local domain of dimension d > 0\nand x be an element of m such that Rx is a CM ring. Then a power of x is a\nuniform local cohomological annihilator of R.\n\n11\n\n\fProof. Let x1 , x2 , * * * , xd be an arbitrary system of parameters in m.\nBy [HH2, Lemma 3.2], there exists a positive integer n such that xn kills all the\nhigher Koszul homology Hi (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xnd d , R), i > 0 for all positive integers\nn1 , n2 , * * * nd . Hence\nxn Him (R) = lim Hd\u2212i (xt1 , xt2 , * * * , xtd , R) = 0\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nfor i < d. It shows that xn is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R.\nLet R be an excellent ring of dimension d > 0. For any prime ideal P of\nR, the regular locus of R/P is a non-empty open subset of Spec(R/P ), and so\nthere exists a non-empty open subset U of Spec(R/P ) such that for any Q \u2208 U ,\n(R/P )Q is CM . By Nagata Criterion for openness, we conclude that the CM\nlocus of R is open in Spec(R) (see [Ma, Theorem 24.5]). Moreover, as every\nminimal prime ideal P of R lies in the CM locus of R, we assert that the CM\nlocus of R is a non trivial open set in Spec(R). Hence we can choose an element\nx \u2208 R\u25e6 such that Rx is a CM ring. Hence we can choose an element x \u2208 R\u25e6\nsuch that Rx is a CM ring. By Proposition 4.3, for any maximal ideal m of\nR, there exists a positive integer nm such that xnm Him (R) = 0 for i < ht(m).\nClearly, the positive integer nm may be dependent on m. To solve Conjecture\n4.1, it suffices to find a positive integer n such that it is independent on the\nchoices of the maximal ideals m. Nevertheless, we have the following useful\ncorollary.\nCorollary 4.4 Let R be an excellent domain of dimension d > 0 and x be an\nelement of m such that Rx is a CM ring. If T is a finite set of maximal ideals of\nR, then there exists a positive integer n such that for any m \u2208 T , xn Him (R) = 0\nfor i < ht(m).\nTo simplify the proof of the main result of this section, we need the following\nlemma, which enable us to obtain the annihilators of local cohomology modules.\nLemma 4.5 Let (R, m) be a noetherian local ring of dimension d. Let x1 , x2 , * * * , xr\nbe a part of system of parameters in m and x an element in m. Suppose that\n(i) R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xnr r ) are CM ;\nni\u22121\nni\u22121\n(ii) For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, x((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xi\u22121\n) : xni i ) \u2282 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xi\u22121\n)\nr i\nhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 , * * * , nr . Then x Hm (R) = 0 for i < d.\nProof. we will use induction on j(0 \u2264 j \u2264 r) to assert that for any positive\nintegers n1 , n2 , * * * , nj\nn\n\nxr\u2212j (Him (R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xj j )) = 0\nfor i < d \u2212 j, and then the lemma follows if we set j = 0.\nBy the assumption, for arbitrary fixed integers n1 , n2 , * * * , nr ,\nR/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xnr r ) is CM , so the conclusion is trivial in this case. Suppose that we have proved the conclusion for t + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 r. For a fixed i with\n\n12\n\n\fi < d \u2212 t, let z be an arbitrary element in Him (R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xnt t )). Choose\nnt+1\na positive integer nt+1 such that xt+1\nz = 0. Put\nn1\nn2\nnt\n(1) Rt = R/(x1 , x2 , * * * , xt )\nnt+1\n(2) Rt+1 = R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xt+1\n)\nnt+1\nn1\nn2\nnt\n(3) Ut = ((x1 , x2 , * * * , xt ) : xt+1\n)/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xnt t ) ;\nnt+1\nn1\nn2\nnt\n(4) Nt = xt+1 (R/(x1 , x2 , * * * , xt )) .\nLet us consider the short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 Nt \u2192 Rt \u2192 Rt+1 \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 Ut \u2192 Rt \u2192 Nt \u2192 0\nwe have the following long exact sequences of local cohomology\n\u03c6i\n\ni\ni\n* * * \u2192 Hi\u22121\nm (Rt+1 ) \u2192 Hm (Nt ) \u2192 Hm (Rt ) \u2192 * * *\n\n\u03c8i\n\n* * * \u2192 Him (Ut ) \u2192 Him (Rt ) \u2192 Him (Nt ) \u2192 * * * .\nIt is easy to see that the composition \u03c6i \u03c8i of \u03c8i and \u03c6i is the morphism\nn\n\nt+1\nxt+1\n\nHim (Rt ) \u2212\u2192 Him (Rt )\nand thus \u03c6i (\u03c8i (z)) = 0. By the induction hypothesis, xr\u2212t\u22121 (Hi\u22121\nm (Rt+1 )) = 0,\nso from the first long exact sequence above, we conclude that (\u03c8i (xr\u2212t\u22121 z)) = 0.\nThe condition (ii) implies that xUt = 0, so xHim (Ut ) = 0. Hence from the\nsecond long exact sequence above, we have xr\u2212t z = 0. By the choice of z, we\nhave proved xr\u2212t (Him (Rt )) = 0. This ends the inductive proof of the lemma.\nIn the rest of the paper, we will make use of Proposition 4.2, Corollary 4.4\nand Lemma 4.5 to prove the following main result of this section.\nTheorem 4.6 Let R be a locally equidimensional excellent ring of dimension\nd > 0. If d \u2264 5, then R has a uniform local cohomological annihilator.\nProof. By Theorem 3.2, we may assume that R is a excellent domain. Moreover,\nlet S be the integral closure of R in the field of fractions of R. Since R is\nexcellent, it follows that S is a finitely generated R-module. We first conclude\nthat if S has a uniform local cohomological annihilator y, then R also has a\nuniform local cohomological annihilator.\nIn fact, as y is integral over R, we have\ny s + a1 y s\u22121 + * * * + as = 0\nfor some elements a1 , * * * , as contained in R with as 6= 0. So it is clear as is\na uniform local cohomological annihilator of S. Consider the following natural\nshort exact sequence\n13\n\n\f0 \u2192 R \u2192 S \u2192 M \u2192 0.\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere M is a finitely generated R-module. It is easy to find a nonzero element\nx of R such that xM = 0. Now, for an arbitrary maximal m of R, the all the\nminimal prime ideals Q1 , Q2 , * * * , Qt of mS are maximal. Thus by the MayerVietoris sequence of local cohomology, we conclude that\nHim (S) \u2243 HiQ1 (S) \u2295 * * * \u2295 HiQt (S).\nand consequently as Him (S) = 0 for i < ht(m). From the long exact sequence\nof local cohomology induced from (4.1), we have as xHim (R) = 0 for i < ht(m).\nThus as x is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R. So in the following\nproof we assume R is a normal domain.\nIf d = 2, then R is CM , and there is nothing to prove. So we assume d > 2.\nSet V = {P \u2208 Spec(R) | RP is not a CM ring}. As R is a excellent ring,\nthe CM locus of R is open in Spec(R), so there exists an ideal I of R such that\nV = V (I). Clearly, ht(I) \u2265 3. Choose elements x1 , x2 , x3 contained in I such\nthat ht((xi , xj )) = 2 for i 6= j, and ht((x1 , x2 , x3 )) = 3.\nClaim 1. The union T1 of the sets of associated prime ideals AssR (R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 ))\nis a finite set, where the union is taken over all positive integers n1 , n2 .\nProof. It is well known the union T0 of the sets of associated prime ideals\nAssR (R/(x1 , xn2 2 )) is a finite set, where the union is taken over all positive\nintegers n2 . We assert that T0 = T1 . By induction on n1 , this follows easily\nfrom the short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 R/(x1 , xn2 2 ) \u2192 R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) \u2192 R/(x1n1 \u22121 , xn2 2 ) \u2192 0\nfor n1 > 1. This proves the claim.\nLet T2 denote the union of T1 and the set of minimal prime ideals of\n(x1 , x2 , x3 ). Clearly, T2 is a finite set. Since Rx3 is CM , by [HH2, Lemma\n3.2], we can choose a positive number n such that, for all positive integers\nn1 , n2 , the following hold\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn3 )P = ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn+1\n)P\n3\n\n(4.2)\n\nfor every prime ideal P lies in the set T2 .\nFor any prime ideal P with (x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2286 P and P \u2208\n/ T2 , it is clear ht(P ) \u2265 4\nand depth(RP /(xn1 1 , xn2 2 )P ) \u2265 1. Localizing at P if necessary, we may assume P\nis a maximal ideal. Giving an element c \u2208 R satisfying P c \u2282 ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn3 ),\nit follows P xn3 c \u2282 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 ). By the choice of P , we have xn3 c \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 ),\nand so we conclude that P is not an associated prime of R/((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn3 ).\nTherefore the associated prime ideals R/((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn3 ) are contained in T2 .\nThus by (4.2), we conclude that\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn3 ) = ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : xn+1\n)\n3\n14\n\n\fhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 .\nSimilarly, enlarging n if necessary, one can prove\n((xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xn1 ) = ((xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xn+1\n)\n1\n((xn1 1 , xn3 3 ) : xn2 ) = ((xn1 1 , xn3 3 ) : xn+1\n).\n2\nReplacing x1 , x2 , x3 by xn1 , xn2 , xn3 respectively, we have proved\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : x3 ) = ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 ) : x23 )\n((xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : x1 ) = ((xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : x21 )\n\n(4.3)\n\n((xn1 1 , xn3 3 ) : x2 ) = ((xn1 1 , xn3 3 ) : x22 )\nhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 .\nIf dim(R/(x1 , x2 , x3 )) = 0, then here are only finite number of maximal ideals\nm such that Rm may not be a CM ring. So by Corollary 4.4, a power of x1 is\na uniform local cohomological annihilator of R. In particular, the conclusion of\nthe theorem holds for d = 3.\nNow, in the following we assume dim(R/(x1 , x2 , x3 )) > 0. Since R is excellent, we can choose an element x4 such that x4 is not contained in any minimal\nprime ideal of (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and (R/(x21 , x22 , x23 ))P is CM for all prime ideals P\nwith x4 \u2208\n/ P . For such a prime ideal P , we conclude by Proposition 4.2 that\n(R/(x21 , x22 , xn3 3 ))P are all CM rings for all positive integers n3 . By (4.3) and by\nProposition 4.2 again, we conclude that (R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ))P are all CM rings\nfor all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 .\nClaim 2. Let m be a maximal ideal of R such that m does not contain the ideal\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ). Then for every xj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 3), x3j Him (R) = 0 for i < ht(m).\nProof. Let m be an arbitrary maximal ideal with x4 \u2208\n/ m. If one of x1 , x2 , x3\ndoes not lie in m, then Rm is CM , and the conclusion is trivial if one of them\ndoes not lie in m. So we may assume m \u2287 (x1 , x2 , x3 ). Clearly, we may also\nassume that R is a d-dimensional local ring with the unique maximal ideal m.\nNote that R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) is CM of dimension d\u22123 for any positive integers\nn1 , n2 , n3 . Moreover, x1 , x2 is a regular sequence in R, so together with (4.3),\nni\u22121\nni\u22121\nwe have for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, xj ((xn1 1 , * * * , xi\u22121\n) for each j\n) : xni i ) \u2282 (xn1 1 , * * * , xi\u22121\nwith 1 \u2264 j \u2264 3. Hence the conclusion of the claim follows immediately from\nLemma 4.5, and this proves the claim.\nBy Claim 2, we have proved that if a maximal ideal m does not contain the\ni\nideal (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ), then for each j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 3), x31 Hm\n(R) = 0 for i < ht(m).\nNow, Suppose that dim(R/(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )) = 0. There are only a finite number\nof maximal ideals m with (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) \u2286 m. So by Claim 2 and Corollary\n4.4, a power of xj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 3) is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of R.\nIn particular, the conclusion of the theorem holds for d = 4. In the following\nproof, we assume dim(R/(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )) > 0.\n15\n\n\fClaim 3. Let T3 be the set of all associated prime ideals of R/(xi11 , xi22 , xi33 ) for\nall positive integers i1 , i2 , i3 satisfying i1 + i2 + i3 \u2264 6. Then for any positive\nintegers n1 , n2 , n3 , every associated prime ideal of R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) lies in T3 .\nProof. We prove the conclusion by induction on n = n1 + n2 + n3 . Clearly,\nif n \u2264 6, the conclusion holds by the assumption. In the following we assume\nn > 6. Suppose we have proved the conclusion for n1 + n2 + n3 < n. It is easy\nto see there exists one of n1 , n2 , n3 , say n3 , such that n3 \u2265 3.\nSuppose that P is an associated prime ideal of R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) and P \u2208\n/ T3 .\nLocalizing at P if necessary, we may assume that R is a local ring with the unique\nmaximal ideal P . Let c \u2208\n/ (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) be an element satisfying\nP c \u2282 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ).\nThen we can express c = xn1 1 c1 + xn2 2 c2 + x3n3 \u22121 c3 by the induction hypothesis.\nFor an arbitrary element z \u2208 P , it implies that there exists c4 \u2208 R such that\nxn3 3 \u22121 (zc3 \u2212 x3 c4 ) \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 ).\nBy (4.3), we have zx3 c3 \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , x23 ). Hence P x3 c3 \u2282 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , x23 ). Since\nn1 + n2 + 2 < n, we conclude x3 c3 \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , x23 ) by the induction hypothesis\nagain,. Consequently c \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ), and this is a contradiction. Therefore\nP \u2208 T3 , and the proof of the claim is complete.\nLet T4 be the set of the union of T3 and the set of all minimal prime ideal\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ). It is clear that T4 is a finite set. By [HH2, Lemma 3.2], we can\nchoose an positive integer n such that for every prime ideal P \u2208 T4\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xn4 4 ))P \u2286 ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xnj ))P .\nfor all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 and j \u2264 3. Replacing xj by xnj , we have\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xn4 4 ))P \u2286 ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xj ))P .\n\n(4.4)\n\nfor all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 and j \u2264 3.\nFor P \u2208\n/ T4 , if P c \u2282 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xj ) for some element c \u2208 R, then P xj c \u2208\nn1\nn2\n(x1 , x2 , xn3 3 ). Thus xj c \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) by the choice of P . This shows that,\nfor all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , the associated primes of R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) :\nxj ) lie in T4 . From this fact and (4.4), one can conclude easily that\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , x3n3 ) : xn4 4 ) \u2286 ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 ) : xj ).\nhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 and j \u2264 3.\nClaim 4. For every permutation i1 , i2 , i3 of 1, 2, 3, we have\n((xni11 , xni22 , xn4 4 ) : x2i3 ) = ((xni11 , xni22 , xn4 4 ) : x3i3 ).\nhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n4 .\n16\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fProof. We only prove the following case:\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn4 4 ) : x23 ) \u2286 ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn4 4 ) : x33 ).\nIn fact, for any element c \u2208 ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn4 4 ) : x33 ), we may express\nx33 c = xn1 1 c1 + xn2 2 c2 + xn4 4 c4\nfor some elements c1 , c2 , c4 \u2208 R. So by (4.5), there exists c3 \u2208 R such that\nx33 (x3 c \u2212 xn4 4 c3 ) \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 ). By (4.3), we have x23 c \u2208 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn4 4 ), and this\nproves the claim.\nReplacing x1 , x2 , x3 by x21 , x22 , x23 if necessary, we may assume\n((xni11 , xni22 , xn4 4 ) : xi3 ) = ((xni11 , xni22 , xn4 4 ) : x2i3 )\n\n(4.6)\n\nfor every permutation i1 , i2 , i3 of 1, 2, 3 and for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n4 .\nMoreover, we can replace x4 by a power of x4 if necessary, and assume that\n((x21 , x22 , x23 ) : x4 ) = ((x21 , x22 , x23 ) : x24 ). Since R is a excellent ring, we can\nchoose an element x5 which is not contained in any minimal prime ideal of\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) such that (R/(x21 , x22 , x23 , x24 ))P is a CM ring for every prime\nideal P with x5 \u2208\n/ P . By the choice of x4 and Proposition 4.2, we conclude that (R/(x21 , x22 , x23 , xn4 4 ))P is a CM ring for every prime ideal P with\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) \u2286 P , x5 \u2208\n/ P and all positive integers n4 . It follows from (4.6)\nand Proposition 4.2 that (R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 ))P are CM local rings for such\nprime ideals P and all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 .\nClaim 5. Let m be a maximal ideal of R such that m does not contain the ideal\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ). Then for every xj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 3), x5j Him (R) = 0 for i < ht(m).\nProof. Note that if m does not contain the ideal (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ), then the conclusion of the claim follows from Claim 2. So we may assume that (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) \u2286\nm and x5 \u2208\n/ m. Replacing R by Rm , we assume that R is a local ring with the\nmaximal ideal m. Observe that x1 , x2 is a regular sequence, (4.3) and (4.5). We\nhave for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4\nn\n\nn\n\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\nxj ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xi\u22121\n) : xni i ) \u2282 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , * * * , xi\u22121\n)\n\nfor each j with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 3. Moreover, by the choice of m, R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 )\nare CM local rings for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 . So the conclusion of\nthe claim follows from Lemma 4.5, and this ends of the proof of the claim.\nNow, if dim(R/(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 )) = 0, then there are only a finite number\nof maximal ideals m with (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) \u2286 m, So by Claim 5, and Corollary\n4.4, a power of xj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 3) is a uniform local cohomological annihilator of\nR. In particular, we have proved the theorem in the case d = 5.\nBefore the end of the paper, we give a remark on the technique used in this\nsection.\n17\n\n\fRemark The proof of Theorem 4.6 depends heavily on Goto's result (Proposition\n4.2). The condition (0 : x) = (0 : x2 ) in Proposition 4.2 is very restricted if one\nconsiders a lot of local rings at the same time. We explain this more explicitly\nby means of the proof of Theorem 4.6. Let R, x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 and x5 be as chosen\nas in the proof of Theorem 4.6. Although we can find an element x6 such that\nfor all maximal ideals m with x6 \u2208\n/ m, R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , x4n4 , x5 ) are CM rings\nfor all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 , it is very difficult to check that\n((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 ) : x5 ) = ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 ) : x25 )\nhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 . So one can not use Proposition 4.2 to\nconclude that R/(xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 , xn5 5 ) are CM rings for all positive integers\nn1 , n2 , n3 , n4 , n5 . Thus the method of this paper can not be used to solve the\nremaining case of Conjecture 4.1. However, with a little more effort, we can\nprove that, after replacing x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 by suitable powers of them, for each\nj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 3)\nxj ((xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 ) : xn5 5 ) \u2286 (xn1 1 , xn2 2 , xn3 3 , xn4 4 )\nhold for all positive integers n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 , n5 . Due to this fact, one can prove\neasily that for any excellent domain R and an element of x in R such that Rx is\nCM , there exists an positive integer n, xn Him (R) = 0 for every maximal ideal\nm and i < min(5, ht(m)) \u2212 1.\nAcknowledgment: The author is deeply grateful to the referee for his or\nher useful pointed comments on the paper and for drawing the author' attention\nto the results about the annihilation of local cohomology modules.\nReferences\n[Ba] Bass, H.: On the ubiquity of Gorenstein rings.
