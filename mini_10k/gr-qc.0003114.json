INTRODUCTION\n\nThis is the second paper in a series devoted to the study of dynamic cosmic strings. In the previous paper [1],\nhenceforth referred to as paper I, we derived the equations of motion for a time dependent cylindrically symmetric\ncosmic string coupled to a gravitational field with two degrees of freedom. The treatment involved using a Geroch\ndecomposition to reformulate the problem in terms of matter fields on a 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime and two geometrical variables \u03bd and \u03c4 which describe the gravitational degrees of freedom. Unlike the original cylindrical metric\nthe reduced 2 + 1 spacetime is asymptotically flat and this allows us to implement a numerical treatment of the field\nequations which includes null infinity as part of the grid. In paper I we presented a Cauchy-characteristic matching\n(CCM) code that reproduced the results of several vacuum solutions with both one and two degrees of freedom but\ndid not perform entirely satisfactorily in the presence of matter. We have therefore developed a second implicit,\npurely characteristic code. The numerical details, the testing and the convergence analysis of this implicit code will\nbe described in this paper. We also give a detailed analysis of the interaction between the string and a pulse of\ngravitational radiation.\nAfter briefly describing the variables used for the coupled system in section II the details of the numerical scheme\nare presented in section III. We begin by describing the relaxation method we use for the much simpler problem of a\nstatic cosmic string in Minkowski spacetime and demonstrate how this approach leads naturally to the implicit scheme\nused to solve the general case of a dynamical cosmic string coupled to gravity. The testing of the code is described\nin section IV. This involves comparing it with exact solutions, checking that static cosmic string initial data remain\nstatic when they are evolved, and undertaking a time dependent convergence analysis of the code. We are able to show\nthat the code is accurate, stable and shows clear second order convergence. In section V we analyse the interaction\nbetween an initially static cosmic string and a Weber\u2013Wheeler type pulse of gravitational radiation. We show that\nthis interaction causes the string fields S and P to oscillate and examine how this oscillation depends upon both the\nwidth and amplitude of the pulse and also upon the constants e, \u03bb and \u03b7. The key result is that the frequencies are\nessentially independent of the nature of the Weber\u2013Wheeler wave but are proportional to the masses mS and mP\nassociated with the scalar field S and the vector field P . The string continues to ring after the gravitational pulse has\nlargely radiated away, but the oscillations slowly decay and the variables eventually return to their static values. It\nis only possible to observe this effect because of the long term stability of the code. Finally in section VI we discuss\nour results and outline future work.\n\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: U.Sperhake@maths.soton.ac.uk\nE-mail: K.R.Sjodin@maths.soton.ac.uk\n\u2021\nE-mail: J.A.Vickers@maths.soton.ac.uk\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fII. THE VARIABLES AND FIELD EQUATIONS\n\nWe begin with a brief summary of the variables used to describe the spacetime and the string. In cylindrical polar\ncoordinates (t, \u03c1, \u03c6, z) we may write the line element for a cylindrically symmetric spacetime with two degrees of\nfreedom as a modified version of that given by Jordan, Ehlers, Kundt and Kompaneets [2], [3]\nds2 = e2(\u03b3\u2212\u03c8) (dt2 \u2212 d\u03c12 ) \u2212 \u03c12 e\u22122\u03c8 d\u03c62 \u2212 e2(\u03c8+\u03bc) (\u03c9d\u03c6 + dz)2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8, \u03c9, \u03bc and \u03b3 are functions of t, \u03c1. As shown in paper I, in order to work with an asymptotically flat spacetime\nit is convenient to make a Geroch decomposition [4] in which the 4-dimensional metric is replaced by a 3-dimensional\none and two auxiliary scalar fields. These scalar fields are the norm of the axial Killing vector \u03bd and the Geroch\npotential \u03c4 and are related to \u03c8 and \u03c9 by equations (15) and (16) of paper I, while the conformal 3-dimensional line\nelement is given by\nd\u03c3\u0303 2 = e2(\u03b3+\u03bc) (dt2 \u2212 d\u03c12 ) \u2212 \u03c12 e2\u03bc d\u03c62 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe cosmic string is described by a complex scalar field \u03a6 coupled to a U(1) gauge field A\u03bc , which in cylindrical\nsymmetry can be written as [1]\n1\n\u03a6 = \u221a S(t, \u03c1)ei\u03c6 ,\n2\n1\nA\u03bc = [P (t, \u03c1) \u2212 1]\u2207\u03bc \u03c6.\ne\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nIt is also helpful to introduce rescaled coupling constants and variables given by\nS\n,\n\u03b7\ne2\n\u03b1= ,\n\u03bb\n\u221a\nr = \u03bb\u03b7\u03c1,\n\u221a\nt\u0303 = \u03bb\u03b7t.\n\nX=\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nHere \u03b7 is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field while \u03b1 represents the relative strength of the coupling\nbetween the scalar and vector field given by e, compared to the self-coupling of the scalar field given by \u03bb. Critical\ncoupling, for which the masses of the scalar and vector fields are equal, is given by \u03b1 = 8 [5].\nThe field equations for a cosmic string coupled to gravity were derived in paper I in terms of Cauchy coordinates\n[Paper I (26)\u2013(33)] and also in terms of compactified characteristic coordinates [Paper I (43)\u2013(49)]. However the fully\ncharacteristic numerical scheme also requires characteristic equations in the inner region.

These equations are only used to provide a check on the numerical\naccuracy of the code.\nIII. NUMERICAL METHODS\n\nIn order to solve the above field equations we have developed two independent codes. The first is based on the\nCauchy-characteristic matching code of Dubal et al. [7] and d'Inverno et al. [8]. This code performs well in the\nabsence of matter and has been used in paper I to study several cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions. In paper\nI we have also given details of the convergence analysis and described the modifications with respect to [7] that lead\nto long term stability with both gravitational degrees of freedom present. However the CCM code performed less\nsatisfactorily in the evolution of the cosmic string. This is due to the existence of unphysical solutions to the evolution\nequations (9)\u2013(14) which diverge exponentially as r \u2192 \u221e. Controlling the time evolution near null infinity by means\nof a bump function enabled us to select the physical solutions with regular behavior at I + , but the bump function\nitself introduced noise which eventually gave rise to instabilities. We therefore implemented a second implicit, purely\ncharacteristic, code which allowed us to directly apply boundary conditions at the origin as well as null infinity and\nthus suppress diverging solutions. It is interesting that this problem is already present in the calculation of the static\ncosmic string in Minkowski spacetime. We will, therefore, first describe the numerical scheme used in the static\nMinkowskian case where the equations are fairly simple. We then present the modifications necessary for the static\nand dynamic case coupled to the gravitational field.\nA. The static cosmic string in Minkowski spacetime\n\nIn (9)\u2013(14) we set the metric variables to their Minkowskian values and all time derivatives to zero to obtain the\nequations for the static cosmic string in Minkowski spacetime (cf.

The combined grid of the inner and the outer region. Note that both grid points, n1 and n1 + 1, correspond to the\nposition r = 1 \u21d4 y = 1. These points form the interface of the code and facilitate transformation of the variables from the\ncoordinate system r into that of y.\n\nso that the region 0 \u2264 w < 3 corresponds to 0 \u2264 r < \u221e and infinity is mapped to w = 3 [1].\nIn terms of the variable y, (16) and (17) take the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\ndP\ny\ny5\n= 4\u03b1X 2 P,\ndy\ndy\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\ndX\n(X 2 \u2212 1)\n2\ny\ny\n= 4X P + 4\n.\ndy\ndy\ny4\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nThe number of grid points in each region may differ, but each half-grid is uniform. Thus we use a total of N := n1 + n2\ngrid points where the points labelled n1 and n1 + 1 both correspond to the position r = 1 = y. The points n1 , n1 + 1\nform the interface between the two regions (see Figure 1). One point will contain the variables in terms of r, the\nother in terms of y. With the computational grid covering the whole spacetime, we now face a two point boundary\nvalue problem. Due to the existence of unphysical solutions diverging at y = 0 shooting methods turned out to be\nunsuitable for solving this problem. On the other hand numerical relaxation, as described in [9] for example, allows\nus to directly control the behavior of P and X at infinity. The form of equations (16), (17) suggests that in order\nto write them as a first order system we should introduce the auxiliary variables Q = r\u22121 P,r and R = rX,r .

Results for various choices of the string\nparameter \u03b1 are shown in Figure 6 of paper I.\nB. The static cosmic string coupled to gravity\n\nFrom the numerical point of view, the problem of solving for a static cosmic string coupled to gravity through the\nEinstein equations is virtually identical to that of a static string in Minkowski spacetime. The only difference is the\nmuch higher degree of complexity of the equations due to the appearance of the functions \u03bd, \u03c4 , \u03bc and \u03b3 as extra\nvariables. We do not present the equations here, since they may be derived from the fully dynamic case by setting\nall time derivatives to zero in the relevant equations. The solution is again obtained using the relaxation method\ndescribed in the previous section. As our initial guess for the metric variables we use Minkowskian values, and for\nthe string variables X and P we use the previously calculated values for a Minkowskian string with the same string\nparameters. The results are shown in Figure 7 of paper I.\nC. The dynamic code\n\nIn the dynamic case all variables \u03bd, \u03c4 , \u03bc, \u03b3, P and X are functions of u, r and we have to solve the system (9)\u2013\n(14) of partial differential equations (PDEs). In order to control the behavior of the solution at infinity, we need\na generalisation for PDEs of the relaxation scheme applied to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In view of\nthe characteristic feature of the relaxation scheme, namely the simultaneous calculation of new function values at all\ngrid points, this generalisation leads directly to implicit evolution schemes as used for hyperbolic or parabolic PDEs.\nTherefore, the dynamic code is based on the implicit, second order in space and time Crank\u2013Nicholson scheme (see [9]\nfor example). For each solution step we consider two spatial slices of the grid-type of Figure 1, labelled n and n + 1.\nWe then apply centered finite differencing according to\nf=\n\nn+1\nn\n+ fkn\nfk+1\n+ fkn+1 + fk+1\n,\n4\n\n(35)\n\nf,r =\n\nn+1\nn\nfk+1\n\u2212 fkn+1 + fk+1\n\u2212 fkn\n,\n2\u2206r\n\n(36)\n\nf,u =\n\nn+1\nn\nfk+1\n+ fkn+1 \u2212 fk+1\n\u2212 fkn\n,\n2\u2206u\n\n(37)\n\nwhere f represents any of our variables. Assuming that all functions are known on slice n we arrive at a large set of\nalgebraic equations for the fin+1 , similar to the static case, which needs to be supplemented by boundary conditions\nand interface relations analogous to (31)\u2013(34). Again the system of algebraic equations is solved iteratively with the\nNewton\u2013Raphson method. The initial guess for the data on the new slice n + 1 is taken from the previous slice and\nconvergence is typically achieved within three iterations. For this purpose we rewrite the dynamic equations (9)\u2013(14)\nas a first order system. The equations for the variables \u03bd, \u03c4 and X involve radial derivatives which may be written\n\u2202\n\u2202\nin terms of the second order operator \u2202r\n(r \u2202r\n) so we introduce the corresponding variables N = r\u03bd,r , T = r\u03c4,r and\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(r2 \u2202r\n), while that for\nR = rX,r [cf. paper I equations (110)\u2013(115)]. The equation for \u03bc on the other hand involves \u2202r\n\u2202\n\u22121 \u2202\n2\n\u22121\nP involves \u2202r (r \u2202r ). We therefore introduce the corresponding variables M = r \u03bc,r and Q = r P,r . Finally the\nequation for \u03b3 involves only one r derivative and may be written in first order form without having to introduce any\nfurther quantities.

We start\nby considering boundary conditions on the axis. In general we find the code is more stable if one imposes boundary\nconditions on the radial derivatives rather than the variables themselves. For the variables \u03bd, \u03c4 and X we therefore\nimpose the required boundary conditions on the initial data, but in the subsequent evolution we impose the weaker\ncondition that their radial derivatives are finite on the axis. This ensures that the evolution equations propagate the\naxial conditions given on the initial data. For the variable \u03bc we impose the condition that M is zero on the axis\nwhich is equivalent to the rather weak condition that r2 \u03bcr vanishes there. The inverse power of r in the definition of\nQ makes it unsuitable to specify the value of this quantity at r = 0 so in this case we work with the variable directly\nand require that P = 1 on the axis. Finally the variable \u03b3 is given by a purely radial equation, so in this case we must\nspecify the value on the axis which is chosen to be zero to ensure elementary flatness. Therefore at r = 0 we require\nN = 0,\nT = 0,\nM = 0,\n\u03b3 = 0,\nP = 1,\nR = 0.\n\n(60)\n(61)\n(62)\n(63)\n(64)\n(65)\n\nFor the boundary conditions at null infinity we know that regular solutions of the cylindrical wave equation have\nradial derivatives that decay faster than 1/r so that we may take the variables N , T and R, which satisfy a wave type\nequation, to vanish at y = 0. The asymptotics of \u03bc are slightly different due to the additional power of r in the radial\nderivative (similar to the spherically symmetric wave equation) but for a regular solution \u03bc,y vanishes at null infinity.\nThe P equation does not satisfy a wave type equation due to the inverse power of r but has asymptotic behavior given\nby a modified Bessel function. The physically relevant finite solution has exponential decay so in this case one may\nimpose the condition that Q = 0 at y = 0. Hence we require the solution to satisfy the following boundary conditions\nat y = 0\nN = 0,\nT = 0,\n\u03bc,y = 0,\nQ = 0,\nR = 0.\n\n(66)\n(67)\n(68)\n(69)\n(70)\n\nThese boundary conditions are sufficient to determine the solution of the first order system (38)\u2013(59) while suppressing\nthe unphysical solutions which are singular on the axis or null infinity. Note that \u03b3 is determined by the constraint\nequation (12), which is a first order ODE, and thus only needs one boundary condition.\n\n7\n\n\fFIG. 2. The deviation of the numerical \u03bd and \u03b3 from the Weber\u2013Wheeler solution as a function of u and w obtained for 1920\ngrid points (n1 = 320, n2 = 1600). The wave parameters are a = 2, b = 0.5. Note that the error is amplified by 105 and 107\nrespectively.\n\nIV. TESTING THE CODE\n\nIn paper I we used the CCM code to reproduce several exact vacuum solutions to an accuracy of about 10\u22125 with\nsecond order convergence. We have also checked the properties of the codes for the static cosmic string in Minkowski\nspacetime and coupled to gravity. Both clearly showed second order convergence. Here we will focus on testing the\nimplicit dynamic code. We have carried out four different independent tests, namely\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nReproducing the non-rotating vacuum solution of Weber and Wheeler [10],\nReproducing the rotating vacuum solution of Xanthopoulos [11],\nUsing the results for the static cosmic string (paper I) as initial data and checking that the system\nstays in its static configuration,\nConvergence analysis for the string hit by a Weber\u2013Wheeler wave.\n\nTwo additional tests arise in a natural way from the field equations and the numerical scheme. As described above\nthere are two additional field equations which are algebraic consequences of the other field equations. We have verified\nthat these equations are satisfied to second order accuracy (\u223c \u2206r2 ). Furthermore the numerical scheme calculates the\nresiduals of the algebraic equations to be solved, which have thus been monitored in test runs. They are satisfied to a\nmuch higher accuracy (double precision machine accuracy), so the total error is dominated by the truncation error of\nthe second order differencing scheme. Another independent test is the comparison with the explicit CCM code which\nyields good agreement for as long as the latter remains stable. The four main tests are now described in more detail.\nA. The Weber\u2013Wheeler wave\n\nIn the first test we evolve the analytic solution given by Weber and Wheeler [10], which describes a gravitational\npulse of the + polarisation mode. This solution has two free parameters, a and b, which can be interpreted as the\nwidth and amplitude of the pulse. The equations together with a more detailed discussion have been given in paper I.\nWe prescribe \u03bd as initial data according to the analytic expressions obtained for a = 2 and b = 0.5 and set the other\nfree variables to zero, while \u03b3 is calculated via quadrature from the constraint equation (12). In Figure 2 we show\nthe deviation of the numerical results from the analytical one for N = 1920 grid points (320 points in the inner, 1600\npoints in the outer region) and a Courant factor of 0.5 with respect to the inner region. The convergence analysis\n(see below) shows that this number of points provides sufficient resolution in the outer region while still keeping\ncomputation times at a tolerable level. All computations presented in this work have been obtained with these grid\nparameters, unless stated otherwise. The code stays stable for much longer time intervals than shown in the figure,\nbut does not reveal any further interesting features as the analytic solution approaches its Minkowskian values and\nthe error goes to zero.\n\n8\n\n\fFIG. 3. The deviation of the numerical \u03bd, \u03c4 , \u03b3 from Xanthopoulos' analytic solution as a function of u and w obtained for\n1920 grid points (n1 = 320, n2 = 1600). Note that the error is amplified by 105 and 106 respectively.\n\nB. The rotating solution of Xanthopoulos\n\nXanthopoulos [11] derived an analytic vacuum solution for Einstein's field equations in cylindrical symmetry containing both the + and \u00d7 polarisation mode. Its analytic form in terms of our metric variables and a more detailed\ndiscussion has been given in paper I. The solution has one free parameter a which is set to one in this calculation.\nThe error of our numerical results is displayed in Figure 3, where we have used the same grid parameters as in the\nWeber\u2013Wheeler case. Again we have run the code for longer times and found that the error approaches zero. We\nconclude that the code reproduces both analytic vacuum solutions with excellent accuracy comparable to that of the\nCCM code and exhibits long term stability.\nC. Evolution of the static cosmic string\n\nThe tests described above only involve vacuum solutions, so the matter part of the code and the interaction between\nmatter and geometry has not been tested. An obvious test involving matter and geometry is to use the result for\nthe static cosmic string in curved spacetime as initial data and evolve this scenario. All variables should, of course,\nremain at their initial values. We have evolved the static string data for our standard grid and the parameter set,\n\u03b1 = 1 and \u03b7 = 0.2, which corresponds to a strong back-reaction of the string on the metric. The results are shown in\nFigure 4. The system stays in its static configuration with high accuracy over a long time interval.\nD. Convergence analysis\n\nOur investigation of the interaction between the cosmic string and gravitational waves will focus on the string being\nhit by a wave of the Weber\u2013Wheeler type. In order to check this scenario for convergence we have run the code for\nthe parameter set \u03b7 = 0.2, \u03b1 = 1, a = 2, b = 0.5 for different grid resolutions, where a and b are again the width\nand amplitude of the Weber\u2013Wheeler wave. In our case it is of particular interest to investigate the time dependence\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 4. The deviation of the metric and matter variables from the initial data in the case of evolving a static cosmic string\nwith \u03b1 = 1, \u03b7 = 0.2. For our standard grid with 1920 points, the configuration stays static to an accuracy of about 10\u22125 over\na range of more than 30000 time steps.\n\nof the convergence to see what resolution we need in order to obtain reliable results for long runs. We calculate the\nconvergence rate in the same way as in the static case (cf. paper I), but this time the l2 -norm is a function of time.\nSo for each variable we have\nrP\n4320 (u)]2\n[\u03a8N\nN\nk (u) \u2212 \u03a8k\n,\n(71)\nl2 [\u2206\u03a8 ](u) =\nN\nwhere the upper label \"4320\" indicates that the high resolution reference solution has been calculated for N = 4320\ngrid points. In Figure 5 we show the convergence factor l2 [\u03a81920 ]/l2 [\u03a82880 ] as a function of u for \u03bd, \u03bc, \u03b3, P and\nX. The initial data for \u03c4 is identically zero for this scenario and stays zero during the evolution. The number of\ngrid points is increased by a factor of 1.5 here (instead of the more commonly used 2) to reduce the computation\ntime. Only points common to all grids have been used in the sum in equation (71). For second order convergence we\nwould expect a convergence factor of 1.52 . Although the results in Figure 5 show weak variations with u, second order\nconvergence is clearly maintained for long runs. In each case the outer region contains 5 times as many grid points\nas the inner region (e.g. n1 = 320, n2 = 1600 for the N = 1920 case). The reason for this is that in the dynamical\n10\n\n\fFIG. 5. The convergence factor l2 [\u03a81920 ]/l2 [\u03a82880 ] is plotted as a function of u. We expect a convergence factor of 2.25\nsince the number of grid points is multiplied by 1.5. Even though our results show weak variability at later times, second order\nconvergence is maintained throughout long runs (more than 30000 time steps with N = 1920).\n\nevolutions X and especially P exhibit significant spatial variations out to large radii. Due to the compactification,\nthe spatial resolution of our grid decreases as we move towards null infinity and to resolve the spatial variations of the\nstring variables out to sufficiently large radii we therefore have to introduce a large number of grid points in the outer\nregion. No such problems occur in the inner region. If significantly fewer grid points are used in the outer region for\nthis analysis, the convergence properties of the string variables can deteriorate to roughly first order level.\nV. TIME DEPENDENCE OF THE STRING VARIABLES\nA. Static cosmic strings excited by gravitational waves\n\nThe scenario we are going to investigate in this section is an initially static cosmic string hit by a gravitational wave\nof Weber\u2013Wheeler type. For this purpose we use the static results with two modifications as initial data. Firstly the\nstatic metric function \u03bd0 is multiplied by the exact Weber\u2013Wheeler solution to simulate the gravitational wave pulse.\nThus we guarantee that initially the cosmic string is indeed in an equilibrium configuration provided the wave pulse\nis located sufficiently far away from the origin and its interaction with the string is negligible. Ideally the numerical\n11\n\n\fFIG. 6. The initial data for \u03bd, P and X at u0 = \u221220 for the standard parameters \u03b1 = 1, \u03b7 = 10\u22123 , a = 2, b = 0.5. The\ngravitational wave pulse is located in a region where the string fields P and X have almost fallen off to their asymptotic values.\n\ncalculation would start with the incoming wave located at past null infinity. In order to approximate this scenario, we\nfound it was sufficient to use the large negative initial time u0 = \u221220. The second modification is to calculate \u03b3 from\nthe constraint equation (12) to preserve consistency with the Einstein field equations. In Figure 6 the corresponding\ninitial data for \u03bd, P and X are shown for the parameter set \u03b7 = 10\u22123 , \u03b1 = 1, a = 2 and b = 0.5. From now on we\nwill refer to these values as \"standard parameters\" and only specify parameters if they take on non-standard values.\nNote that \u03c4 vanishes on the initial slice in this case and stays identically zero throughout the evolution. The case of\nrotating gravitational waves hitting a cosmic string will be analysed in a future publication. The time evolution of\nthe \"standard configuration\" is shown in Figure 7 where we plot \u03bd, \u03bc, \u03b3, P and X as functions of w at times \u221220,\n\u221210, 0, 2 and 10. While the wave pulse is still far away from the origin, its interaction with the cosmic string is\nnegligible (dotted lines). When it reaches the core region, however, it excites the cosmic string and the scalar and\nvector field start oscillating (dashed curves). After being reflected at the origin, the wave pulse travels along the\noutgoing characteristics and the metric variables \u03bd, \u03bc and \u03b3 quickly settle down into their static configuration which\nis close to Minkowskian values for \u03b7 = 10\u22123 . The vector and scalar field of the cosmic string, on the other hand,\ncontinue ringing albeit with a different character. Whereas the oscillations of the scalar field X are dominant in the\nrange r \u2264 2 and have significantly decayed at u = 10 as shown in the figure, the vector field oscillations propagate to\nlarge radii and fall off very slowly (solid curves). This behavior is also illustrated in the right panel of Figure 8 which\nshows a contour plot of P as a function of (u, r) out to r = 50. We shall see below, that the oscillations of P will also\ndecay eventually and the cosmic string will asymptotically settle back into its equilibrium configuration.\nB. Frequency analysis\n\nWe will now quantitatively analyse the oscillations of the scalar and vector field\n\u221a of the cosmic string. Since we are\nworking in rescaled coordinates, time and distance are measured in units of 1/ \u03bb\u03b7 and frequency in its inverse. To\navoid complicated notation, however, we will omit the units from now on unless the meaning is unclear. In order to\nmeasure frequencies, we Fourier analyse the time evolution of the scalar and vector field for fixed radius r. Figure 9\nshows P and X for standard parameters as functions of time at r = 1 together with the corresponding power spectra.\nThe plots for X show a characteristic frequency fX = 0.43 whereas for P we find a strong peak at fP = 0.16. The\nspectrum for P , however, also shows a strong mode at f = 0.43. We have calculated similar power spectra for a\nlarge class of parameter sets and discovered this effect on numerous occasions - in addition to a strong peak at the\ncharacteristic frequency of P or X there is a second maximum at the characteristic frequency of the other field. In\ngeneral the characteristic mode of X resulted in stronger peaks at smaller radius, that of P was stronger at larger\nradii. We attribute this feature to the interaction between the scalar and vector component of the cosmic string. The\nvariation of the relative strength of the oscillations with radius confirms the corresponding observation in Figure 7.\nThe accuracy of the measurements of the frequencies is limited by the resolution of the Fourier spectra which again\nis limited by the time interval covered in the evolution and, thus, by computation time. For tolerable computation\n\n12\n\n\fFIG. 7. The metric and string variables are plotted as functions of w for u = \u221220 (dotted), u = \u221210 (long dotted), u = 0\n(dashed), u = 2 (long dashed) and u = 10 (solid line). For clarity the the graphs of P are distributed over two panels. The\nwave pulse (in \u03bd) initially moves inwards. It excites the string, is reflected at the origin and travels outwards. After u = 10\nonly P differs significantly from the static configuration as the oscillations slowly decay and propagate towards larger radii (cf.\nFigure 8).\n\ntimes we get an accuracy \u2206f \u2248 0.01 which corresponds approximately to one bin in the frequency spectra.\nIn order to investigate the dependency of the oscillations on \u03b1, \u03b7, a, b and the radial position r, we have varied\neach parameter over at least two orders of magnitude while keeping the other parameters at standard values. We\nhave found the following dependencies:\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe frequencies of both X and P did not show any variations with \u03b7 for \u03b7 < 0.1. (Note that \u03b7 does,\nhowever, appear in the units). For larger values of \u03b7, the non-linear interaction between string and\ngeometry becomes dominant and we did not find a simple relation between frequency maxima and\nparameters.\nThe variation of the parameters a and b, the width and amplitude of the Weber\u2013Wheeler pulse,\nhas no measurable effect on the frequencies of X and P , but only determined the amplitude of the\noscillations. A narrow, strong pulse leads to larger amplitudes.\n\n13\n\n\fFIG. 8. The cosmic string variable P is shown as a function of radius and time for \u03b1 = 0.2 (left) and \u03b1 = 1 (right) (all other\nparameters have standard values). Note that we use the radial variable r out to r = 50 here. The ringing can clearly be seen\nand shows a lower frequency for smaller \u03b1.\n\nFIG. 9. Upper panels: The variables P and X at r = 1 are plotted as functions of u for \u03b1 = 1, \u03b7 = 10\u22123 , a = 2 and b = 0.5.\nLower panels: The corresponding power spectra. The spectrum for P shows a strong peak at f = 0.16, that for X at f = 0.43.\nThe latter component, however, is also clearly present in the spectrum of P which we attribute to the interaction\nbetween the\n\u221a\nfields (see text for details). Note that due to our rescaling of the coordinates, u is measured in units of 1/ \u03bb\u03b7.\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nFor small r the oscillations in X are stronger, whereas those for P dominate at large r. The frequency\nvalues, however, do not depend on the radius. For radii greater than 10 the oscillations in X had\ndecayed so strongly that we could no longer measure its frequency.\nTo first order approximation the frequency of the scalar field, fX , is independent of \u03b1 over the observed\nrange 0.1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 10. fP , however, shows a strong dependence on \u03b1 which is also illustrated in Figure\n8, where we compare contour plots of P obtained for \u03b1 = 0.2 and 1. The frequency is significantly\n\n14\n\n\fFIG. 10. The frequencies fP ('+') and fX ('\u00d7') are plotted as functions of \u03b1. The curves have been obtained from fitting\npower laws. For 5 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 8 the expected frequencies for P and X are similar and we found only one maximum in the power\nspectra. These values are plotted as filled lozenges and have not been included in the regression analysis as their classification\nis not obvious. The power law for P coincides with the observed values to within measurement accuracy. The frequencies of\nX, however, show a significant, albeit small, deviation from the fitted constant line.\n\nlarger for \u03b1 = 1.\nIn Figure 10 we show fP and fX as functions of \u03b1 together with the power laws obtained from a linear regression of\nthe corresponding double logarithmic data. In the range 5 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 8 (where \u03b1 = 8 corresponds to the critical coupling),\nthe expected values of fP and fX become similar and we observed only one maximum in the corresponding power\nspectra. Therefore a classification with respect to the vector or scalar origin of the frequencies is not obvious. These\nvalues (shown by filled lozenges in Figure 10) have not been used in the regression analysis. We obtain power law\nindices \u03c3X = 0.00 and \u03c3P = 0.50, so that\nfX \u223c const.\n\u221a\nfP \u223c \u03b1.\n\n(72)\n(73)\n\nWhereas the fitted curve for fP coincides with the observed values to high accuracy, Figure 10 shows a small but\nsignificant deviation of the measured fX from the fitted constant line. Indeed the sizable range over \u03b1 for which\nwe observe only one frequency indicates significant non-linear interaction similar to the effect of phase locking in\nnon-linear systems of ODEs [12]. If we consider fX and fP to be given by (72) and (73) in terms of the rescaled\nunphysical coordinates and we transform this back into physical units using \u03b1 = e2 /\u03bb, we arrive at the following\nrelations for the physical variables\n\u221a\nfX \u223c \u03bb\u03b7,\n(74)\nfP \u223c e\u03b7.\n\n(75)\n\nf X \u223c mX ,\n\n(76)\n\nf P \u223c mP .\n\n(77)\n\n\u221a\nAs shown in [5] up to constant factors \u03bb\u03b7 and e\u03b7 are the masses of the scalar and the vector field, mX and mP , and\nwe conclude that X and P have characteristic frequencies\n\nSince the frequencies for X and P seem only to depend upon the respective masses we have attempted to confirm\nthese results by considering the oscillations of a cosmic string in two further scenarios. Firstly since the frequencies\ndo not depend upon the Weber\u2013Wheeler pulse we take as initial data the static values for the metric variables but\nexcite the string by adding a Gaussian perturbation to either the X or P static initial values. The evolution is\n15\n\n\fFIG. 11. The upper four plots show the difference between the evolved functions \u03bd, \u03bc, \u03b3 and X and their corresponding\nstatic results. For P a similar 3-dimensional plot is not suitable since it fails to resolve the oscillations of the vector field.\nTherefore we plot the l2 -norm (dashed line) and the maximum (solid line) of \u2206P as a function of time. \u03bd, \u03bc, \u03b3 and X quickly\nsettle down in their equilibrium configuration to numerical accuracy. The decay of the oscillations of P takes significantly more\ntime but eventually P also approaches its equilibrium state.\n\nthen computed using the fully coupled system. Secondly since the frequencies do not seem to depend upon the\nstrength of the coupling to the gravitational field we have completely decoupled the gravitational field and considered\nthe evolution of a cosmic string in Minkowski spacetime. The initial data is taken to be that for a static string in\nMinkowski spacetime with a Gaussian perturbation to either the X or P values. The evolution is then computed\nusing the equations for a dynamical string in a Minkowskian background [equations (85) and (86) of paper I]. In both\ncases we find the same frequencies, to within an amount \u2206f = 0.01, that we found in the original case of the fully\ncoupled system excited by a Weber\u2013Wheeler pulse. Furthermore the frequencies did not depend on the location or\nshape of the field perturbation nor upon the choice of X or P as the perturbed field.\n\n16\n\n\fC. The long term behavior of the dynamic string\n\nThe time evolution shown in Figures 7 and 8 indicate that the oscillations of the cosmic string excited by gravitational waves gradually decay and metric and string settle down into an equilibrium state. We have calculated a very\nlong run (\u221220 \u2264 u \u2264 410) to investigate the long term behavior in detail. The unphysically large value of \u03b7 = 0.1\nis chosen for this calculation in order to guarantee a strong interaction between spacetime geometry and the cosmic\nstring. In Figure 11 we show the difference \u2206f := fevol \u2212 fstat between the time-dependent \u03bd, \u03bc, \u03b3 and X and their\ncorresponding static results obtained for the same parameters. For the vector field P a similar 3-dimensional plot\nwould require an extreme resolution to properly display the oscillations of the vector field (cf. Figure 7). For this\nreason we proceed differently and calculate the l2 -norm and the maximum of \u2206P for each slice u = const. Both\nfunctions are plotted versus time in Figure 11. The incoming wave pulse can clearly be seen as a strong deviation\nof \u03bd from the static function. The pulse excites the cosmic string and is reflected at the origin at u = 0. The\nmetric variables and the scalar field X then quickly reach their equilibrium values. The oscillations in P decay on a\nsignificantly longer time scale which is also evident in Figures 7 and 8 and the l2 -norm of \u2206P slowly approaches zero.\nSignificantly longer runs than shown here are prohibited by the required computational time, but the results indicate\nthat P will also eventually reach its equilibrium configuration.\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have described the details of the implicit, fully characteristic, numerical scheme which is used to\nsolve the field equations for a cosmic string coupled to gravity. A feature of the cosmic string equations is that they\nadmit exponentially diverging unphysical solutions. By using a Geroch decomposition it is possible to reformulate\nthe problem in terms of fields which describe the string on an asymptotically flat 2 + 1-dimensional metric as well as\ntwo auxiliary fields \u03bd and \u03c4 which describe the gravitational degrees of freedom. We can then introduce a conformally\ncompactified radial coordinate y which allows us to include null infinity as part of the numerical grid. As well as\navoiding the need to introduce artificial outgoing boundary conditions at the edge of the grid this approach has the\nadvantage that we can also enforce boundary conditions for the string variables at null infinity which rule out the\nunphysical solutions. The use of the geometrically defined Geroch variables also improves the long term stability of\nthe code compared to the use of metric variables.\nThe code has been shown to reproduce the results of two exact vacuum solutions, the Weber\u2013Wheeler solution which\ndescribes a pulse of gravitational radiation with just the + polarisation state, and a solution due to Xanthopoulos\nwhich describes a gravitational wave with both the + and \u00d7 polarisation states. The code has also been shown to\nreproduce the results of the static cosmic string code in that initial data corresponding to a static solution do not\nchange when evolved in time using the dynamical code. For both the exact vacuum solutions and the static initial\ndata the code shows excellent long term stability. Finally a time dependent convergence analysis demonstrates clear\nsecond order convergence of the code.\nAfter demonstrating the reliability of the code we use it to analyse the interaction between an initially static\ncosmic string and a Weber\u2013Wheeler type pulse of gravitational radiation. We find that the gravitational wave excites\nthe string and causes the string variables X and P to oscillate before the configuration slowly settles back into its\nequilibrium state. In terms of the unphysical rescaled variables we find that the frequencies of the oscillations are\nessentially independent of the value of the coupling constant \u03b7 and of the width and amplitude of the Weber\u2013Wheeler\n\u221a\npulse. We also find that the frequency of X is independent of \u03b1 while that of P is proportional to \u03b1. When this\nresult is translated back into the physical units we find that the frequency of the scalar field is proportional to the\nmass of the scalar field and the frequency of the vector field is proportional to the mass of the vector field. This result\nis confirmed by investigating two further scenarios. Firstly we consider the evolution of static initial data for the\nstring coupled to the gravitational field, but with a Gaussian perturbation to one of the string variables, and secondly\nwe consider the same thing but in a Minkowskian background with the gravitational field decoupled. In both cases\nwe obtain the same relationship between the frequencies and the mass.\nHaving investigated the interaction between a Weber\u2013Wheeler type pulse of gravitational radiation and the cosmic\nstring, the next obvious step is to consider the interaction between the string and a pulse of gravitational radiation\nwith both polarisation states present. The code will also be a valuable tool in comparing the numerical results with\nthose that one gets from using perturbation theory or the thin string limit to approximate the behavior of a cosmic\nstring coupled to gravity.\n\n17\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Ray d'Inverno for helpful discussions and Denis Pollney for help with GRTensor II.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nSj\u00f6din K.R.P., Sperhake U. and Vickers J.A., Dynamic Cosmic Strings I, preprint gr-qc/0002096 (2000)\nJordan P., Ehlers J. and Kundt W., Abh.
