Although anomalies had been noted from time to time in\nthe abundances of a number of individual elements (see discussion in Gratton, Sneden, &\nCarretta 2004), the description of populations in terms of a helium abundance and an overall\nheavy-element abundance seemed firm. The \"second-parameter problem\" has continued to\nbe a pain for many decades, and unusual HB morphologies were turning up more often, but\nthe implications for the origin and evolution of GC stars remained ambiguous. Similarly,\ntheoreticians had predicted that self-enrichment (Cotrell & Da Costa 1981, Ventura et al.\n2001, Ventura & D'Antona 2005, Maeder & Meynet 2005) or mergers might generate multiple\npopulations in clusters, but such predictions remained controversial (see, e.g., Fenner et al.\n2004, Bekki & Norris 2006), and had little observational basis. Most important for our\ndiscussion here, the idea of one clear sequence in each part of the HR diagram of each cluster\nstood firm.\nNow, however, the paradigm of GC hosting simple stellar populations has been seriously\nchallenged by the discovery of multiple evolutionary sequences in \u03c9 Centauri (Bedin et al.\n2004) and NGC 2808 (Piotto et al. 2007, P07). In both clusters the evidence that stars must\nhave formed in distinct bursts is the presence of multiple main sequences (MSs). However,\nthe two objects differ in at least two important aspects: The stars of \u03c9 Cen have a large\nspread in metal content, whereas in NGC 2808 only oxygen and sodium are observed to vary\nmuch. Omega Cen shows at least four distinct subgiant branches (SGBs), implying a range\nof ages, while the narrow turnoff in NGC 2808 implies that there is little or no difference\nin age among its populations. One more cluster, M54, shows a complex color-magnitude\ndiagram (see, e.g., Layden & Sarajedini 2000), including a bifurcated SGB (see paper IV of\nthis series, Siegel et al. 2007). This cluster has been shown, however, in too many papers\nto cite here, to be a part of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy that is in process of merging into\nthe Milky Way, and very possibly the actual nucleus of that galaxy. (Actually, it is still\nmatter of debate which parts of the color-magnitude diagram of M54 represent the cluster\npopulation and which ones are due to the Sagittarius stars.) Even though \u03c9 Cen could very\nwell represent a similar situation, we feel that M54 is very different from the clusters that\nwe discuss here, and we will therefore not include it in the discussions of this paper.\nThe puzzling observational facts for \u03c9 Cen and NGC 2808 call for a more careful analysis of the MS, turnoff (TO), and subgiant branch of other GCs. In this respect, the colormagnitude diagram (CMD) database from the HST Treasury program GO-10755 (see Sarajedini et al. 2007) provides a unique opportunity to search for anomalies in the different\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nevolutionary sequences of other Galactic GCs. Even though the narrow F606W \u2212 F814W\ncolor baseline is far from ideal for identifying multiple main sequences, our observing strategy was devised to have a very high signal/noise ratio at the level of the TO, and therefore\nthe CMDs are perfectly suitable for identifying multiple TO/SGBs, such as those as found\nin \u03c9 Cen. (New HST observations specifically devoted to the identification of multiple MSs\nare already planned for other massive GCs, in GO-10922 and GO-11233.)\nIndeed, a first look at the entire Treasury database showed at least one other GC whose\nCMD clearly indicates the presence of multiple stellar populations: NGC 1851. Although\nNGC 1851 is a massive GC with a prototypical bimodal horizontal branch (HB), not much\nattention has been devoted to the study of its stellar population. The most complete photometric investigation of this cluster is by Saviane et al. (1998), and the most extended\nspectroscopic analysis was done over 25 years ago, by Hesser et al. (1982). Saviane et al.\n(1998) confirmed the bimodal nature of the HB of NGC 1851, but did not find any other\nanomaly in its CMD. Hesser et al. (1982) found that three out of eight bright red giant\nbranch (RGB) stars have extremely strong CN bands.\nThe present paper is based on new photometry of NGC 1851, from HST /ACS imaging\nand from archival WFPC2 images. Section 2 describes the data sets, and \u00a7 3 presents the\ncolor-magnitude diagram from the ACS data, with a split in the subgiant branch clearly\nvisible. In \u00a7 4 we use the WFPC2 data, both for proper-motion elimination of field stars and\nto construct a CMD with a broader wavelength baseline which we use to set a severe upper\nlimit on any spread in the main sequence. Section 5 discusses the properties of the SGB\nand of the horizontal branch, and shows that the two parts of each have the same spatial\ndistribution. Section 6 considers the ages of the two populations, and \u00a7 7 is a discussion and\nsummary.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Measurements\n\nThe main database used in this paper comes from HST ACS/WFC images in the F606W\nand F814W bands, taken for GO-10775 (P.I. Sarajedini). In addition, we use HST WFPC2\narchive data from GO-05696 (P.I. Bohlin) to extend the wavelength range to the blue, as\nwell as to obtain proper motions. The data sets are summarized in Table 1.\nThe photometric and astrometric measurements were made for both WFPC2 and ACS\nusing the algorithms described by Anderson & King (2000, 2006). Each image was reduced\nindependently, with the observations averaged to produce a single flux for each star in each\nfilter. We put the WFC photometry into the Vega-mag system following the procedures in\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nBedin et al. (2005) and adopting the encircled energy and zero points as given by Sirianni et\nal. (2005). WFPC2 data were photometrically calibrated following Holtzman et al. (1995).\nThe proper motions were derived as in Bedin et al. (2006).\nBreathing can change the focus of the telescope, which can result in small spatial variations of the PSF relative to the library PSF, and consequently in small spatial variations\nof the photometric zero point. In order to deal with any residual PSF variation, we used\na method similar to the one described in Sarajedini et al. (2007) to perform a spatial fit\nto the color residuals relative to the main-sequence ridge line, and remove them. In this\ncase, however, the corrections were made only to colors, rather than along a reddening line,\nbecause, as noted in Section 3, the reddening of NGC 1851 is so small that what we are\ncorrecting is surely differences between the spatial variations of the PSF in the two filters,\nrather than differential reddening. The spatially dependent correction was at the level of\n\u223c0.01 magnitude, and merely sharpens the sequences a little.\n\n3.\n\nThe ACS/WFC Color-Magnitude Diagram\n\nIn Figure 1 we show the color-magnitude diagram for the ACS/WFC photometry. The\nleft panel shows the original CMD. The main result is already evident: the subgiant branch\n(SGB) is split into two distinct branches. The right panel shows the CMD after the correction\nfor the spatial variation of the color zero point. The SGB split is still there, and there are\nclearly two sequences down to the cluster TO. No separation is evident in the main sequence.\nIt must be immediately noted that because of the narrowness of MS below the TO, the SGB\nbroadness can be due neither to any residual spatial variation of the zero point nor to any\ndifferential reddening, which is expected to be negligible because of the low reddening of\nNGC 1851 [E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.02, Harris 1996].\nThe two SGBs remain separated by \u223c 0.1 mag in the magnitude interval 18.0 <\nmF606W < 19.0, over the color interval 0.5 < mF606W \u2212 mF814W < 0.6.

In NGC 2808, the main sequence splits into three distinct sequences a couple of\nmagnitudes below the turnoff, but the SGB shows no evidence of splitting. In Omega Cen,\nboth the SGB and the MS show evidence of splitting. Here, it is only the SGB that is split.\nWe will see that the main sequence of NGC1851 appears consistent with a single population.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nThe WFPC2 Data\n\nProper motions for field decontamination\n\nWe used the archival WFPC2 images as a first epoch to determine proper motions.\nWFPC2 has a field of view that is only \u223c50% of the ACS field, and the crowding prevented\nus from measuring good WFPC2 positions for stars within 500 ACS/WFC pixels of the\ncluster center. This somewhat reduces the size of our sample.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 2 we show the CMD, using the F336W magnitudes from the\nWFPC2 images and the F814W magnitudes from the ACS images. The second column of\npanels shows the proper-motion diagrams of the stars for four different magnitude intervals.\nIt should be noted that we measure proper motions relative to a reference frame made up of\nonly cluster members, so that the zero point of our motions is the mean motion of the cluster.\nIn the third column the magnitudes of the proper motion vectors are plotted against stellar\nmagnitude. The errors clearly increase toward fainter magnitudes. The line was drawn in\norder to isolate the stars that have member-like motions, and was derived as follows. First,\nwe note that in our study of SGB stars it is more important to have a pure cluster sample\nthan a complete one, so we make a conservative choice. Taking each interval of 1 magnitude\nin F336W, we begin by estimating the sigma of the member-like motions. To do this we find\nthe size of proper motion that includes 70% of the stars; for a bivariate Gaussian this radius\nshould lie at 1.552\u03c3, where \u03c3 refers to each dimension. We then plot a point at 2.448\u03c3,\nwhich is the size that should include 95% of the cluster stars. We use spline interpolation to\ndraw a line through these points, and choose all the stars to the left of the line. By giving\nup 5% of the cluster stars we effectively exclude nearly all of the field stars. The rightmost\npanel shows the CMD of our chosen cluster stars.\nIn Fig. 3 we summarize the results. The top left panel shows a zoomed CMD around\nthe SGB for the stars in our proper-motion-selected sample. Stars marked in red are are\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nbSGB stars (119 objects), and the ones in blue are fSGB stars (88 objects). In the bottom\nright panel is the vector point diagram for the same stars. The two SGBs seem to have the\nsame proper motion distribution. To show this more clearly, in the adjacent panels we plot\nnormalized histograms of the separate components of the proper motions, for the stars of\nthe three groups separately. Gaussian fits are also shown.\nA side-benefit of proper-motion cleaning is that it also removes from the CMD stars\nthat did not have well-measured positions. These stars tend to have poor photometry as\nwell, so removing them naturally improves the quality of the CMD.\n\n4.2.\n\nWide color baseline\n\nThe second benefit of the WFPC2 data is that it provides a much better color baseline\nthan the ACS data alone; our study of NGC 2808 (P07) showed that a wider color baseline\nyields a more significant splitting of the main sequence. The CMD in Figure 2 shows F336W\nvs. the F336W \u2212 F814W color. The SGB split is even more clear in this figure than in the\nV \u2212 I CMD of Figure 1 from the ACS data alone - but what is more important is that we\nnow have a better opportunity to study any possible color spread in the main sequence. Any\nlimits on the intrinsic width of the main sequence will translate directly into upper limits on\nspreads in the helium and heavy-element abundances, since age differences have little effect\nbelow the turnoff. (We note, however, the possibility that simultaneous changes in He and\nheavy elements could have effects that offset each other.)\nFig. 4 shows the color distribution of the MS stars. The left panel repeats a part of the\nproper-motion-selected CMD that we showed in Fig. 2. In order to derive the main sequence\nridge line (MSRL) we divided the CMD into intervals of 0.2 mag in the F336W band and\ncomputed the median color in each interval. By fitting these median points with a spline,\nwe obtained a raw fiducial line. Then for each star we calculated the difference in color with\nrespect to the fiducial, and took as the \u03c3 the location of the 68th percentile of the absolute\nvalues of the color differences. All stars with a color distance from the MSRL greater than\n4\u03c3 were rejected, and the median points and the \u03c3 were redetermined. The middle panel of\nFig. 4 shows the same CMD as the left panel, but after subtracting from each star the MSRL\ncolor appropriate for its F336W magnitude. Finally, the right panel shows the histograms\nof the color distributions in five different magnitude intervals.\nThe color distribution is fairly well reproduced by a Gaussian, and there is no evidence\nof a split of the MS, such as observed in \u03c9 Cen or NGC 2808. Since most of the error in\ncolor will come from the WFPC2 photometry, which will at best have an error of 0.02 mag\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Left: F336W vs. F336W \u2212 F814W CMD for all stars.

As Fig. 4 shows\nthat the MS broadening can be represented with a Gaussian with \u03c3 \u223c 0.05, we obtain an\nupper limit for the intrinsic color dispersion of the MS of NGC 1851 of \u03c3M S = 0.04.\n\n5.\n\nTwo Stellar populations in NGC 1851\n\nIn this section we will derive the basic properties of the two SGBs, and consider whether\nother features in the CMD may indicate the presence of two stellar populations in NGC 1851.\n\n5.1.\n\nSGB population ratios\n\nFigure 5 shows how we fitted Gaussians to the magnitude distributions of the bSGB\nand fSGB stars to estimate their number ratio. The top panel of the figure is a blow-up\nof the part of the SGB where the split occurs. The red line is a fiducial line through the\nbSGB. We drew it by marking the middle magnitude level of bSGB at four equally spaced\npoints and drawing a line through them by means of a spline fit. In the middle panel the\nmagnitude of each star has had subtracted from it the magnitude of this fiducial line at the\ncolor of the star. For the analysis that was to follow, we divided the color range into four\nsections, as shown.\nIn each color section we estimated the fraction of stars in each of the SGBs, as follows.\nOur aim was to fit the magnitude distributions in the two branches by a pair of overlapping\nGaussians, but we felt the need to eliminate outliers, especially in the bluest color section.\nThis we did by making a preliminary least-squares fit of the Gaussians, using all of the stars.\nWe then repeated the solution, but omitting the stars that lay more than 2\u03c3 above the\nmidpoint of the Gaussian for bSGB or more than 2\u03c3 below the midpoint of the Gaussian\nfor fSGB (using in each case the sigma of the corresponding Gaussian). In the middle panel\nof Fig. 5 the horizontal lines show the midpoint of the final Gaussians. The red dashed line\nruns 2\u03c3b on the bright side of the bSGB, and the blue dashed line runs 2\u03c3f on the faint side\nof the fSGB (where the \u03c3's are those of the best-fitting Gaussians in each color section, fitted\nto the distributions of the bSGB and fSGB stars, respectively). The stars rejected consist\nof field stars, objects with poor photometry, or binaries (brighter than the bSGB). We have\nalso marked, in the top panel of Fig. 5, the values of the Gaussian centers of bSGB with\nlarge dots and the spline through them with continuous lines. The crosses are the Gaussian\ncenters of fSGB lowered by 2\u03c3f , and the dashed lines are a spline fitted through the crosses.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Left: The same CMD as shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 2, with our MSRL\noverplotted; Middle: The CMD, rectified by subtraction of the MSRL; Right: Color distribution of the rectified CMD. The \u03c3 in the inset are those of the best-fitting Gaussians.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Top: F606W vs. F606W \u2212 F814W diagram zoomed around the SGB. The red\ncontinuous lines show the adopted fiducial line for the bSGB; the other lines are explained\nin the text. Middle: The same diagram, after subtraction of the bSGB fiducial line. The\nlines are explained in the text. Bottom: Distribution in magnitude of the bSGB stars (red)\nand fSGB (blue). The numbers indicate the fraction of stars in each SGB, as the area of the\nbest-fitting Gaussians, shown in the plot. (See the text for more details.)\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nThe bottom section of Fig. 5 shows the histogram of the magnitude distribution in each\ncolor section of the middle panel, and the best-fitting Gaussians. The numbers reported\nin the figures give the percentage of total area under each of the two Gaussians, i.e., the\npercentage of bSGB (red) and fSGB (blue) in each interval.\nWhen we added up, for each SGB, the areas under the four Gaussians fitted to the\nseparate color sections, we found that 55% of the stars belong to the bSGB, and 45% to the\nfSGB. Although the expected sigma of samplings from a binomial distribution of more than\n1000 stars, with a probability of 0.55, is less than 2%, we estimate that our observed 55/45\nsplit really has an uncertainty that is more like 5%. This estimate is based on the differing\nresults of several different ways of fitting the Gaussians (e.g., as simple a thing as changing\nthe bin-width of the histograms).\nAs for the intrinsic width of each SGB, the dispersions in magnitude of the two Gaussians in the color sections where the two SGBs are well separated are of the order of 0.02\nmag, consistent with the uncertainties in our corrections for spatial variation of the PSF.\n(Paradoxically, WFC colors are more accurate than WFC magnitudes, because these corrections are what limits the accuracy of high-S/N photometry, and in the case of colors the\ncorrections are only for the difference in behavior of the PSF through two different filters.)\n\n5.2.\n\nSpatial distribution of the SGB stars\n\nFigure 6 shows the spatial distributions of the two SGB components. We select the two\nSGB subsamples as shown in the bottom-right panel, and plot the spatial distributions in\nthe bottom-left panel. Stars from both groups have similar spatial distributions. This is also\nconfirmed by the cumulative radial distributions shown in the top panel. The KolmogorovSmirnov statistic shows that in random samplings from the same distribution a difference\nthis large would occur 11% of the time, which is very reasonable for the hypothesis that the\ntwo SGBs have the same distribution.\n\n5.3.\n\nThe horizontal branch stars\n\nSince the WFC data set included short exposures, we can also examine the horizontal\nbranch (HB) population. Figure 7 shows the upper part of the F606W vs. F606W \u2212 F814W\nCMD. The NGC 1851 HB is clearly bimodal. Interestingly enough, the red HB contains\n63 \u00b1 7% of the total red + blue HB stars (242 stars), and the blue part contains 37 \u00b1 9%\nof the red + blue HB stars (143 stars). Note that some stars populate the RR Lyrae gap.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Lower right: Selection of the bSGB stars (red dots) and fSGB stars (blue dots).\nLower Left: Spatial distribution of the bSGB and fSGB stars. Top: Cumulative radial\ndistributions of the bSGB and fSGB stars.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nIt is difficult to extract RR Lyrae variables from the small number of exposures that went\ninto Fig. 7, with each star caught at random phases in each color band. In any case, the\ncontribution of the RR Lyraes to the total population of the HB stars is <10% (see Saviane\net al. 1998 and Walker 1992). As in the case of the bSGB and fSGB, stars from the red\nand blue HB groups have similar spatial distributions (see top right panel of Fig. 7). This\nis also confirmed by the cumulative radial distributions shown in the bottom panel. The\nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistic shows that in random samplings from the same distribution a\ndifference this large would occur 17% of the time, so here too there is no significant indication\nof a difference in their radial distribution.\nNeither for the SGB stars nor for the HB stars is the distribution of the two samples significantly different. It would obviously be desirable to strengthen the statistics by combining\nthe two sets of counts, but unfortunately this is not possible, because the incompletenesses\nin star counts at the HB and at the SGB level are different.\nOn the basis of the relative numbers of red to blue HB stars and of bSGB to fSGB\npopulations, it is very tempting to connect the bSGB (which includes 55% of the SGB stars)\nwith the red HB, and the fSGB (45% of the SGB stars) with the blue HB stars.\n\n6.\n\nThe ages of the two populations\n\nThe dispersion in the MS in F336W \u2212 F814W is less than 0.04 mag. Such a narrow\nmain sequence implies that either the two SGB populations have the same metallicities and\nthe same helium abundances or some fortuitous combination of abundances that results in no\nMS split. Comparison with the theoretical models of Dotter et al. (2007) provides an upper\nlimit to a possible dispersion in [Fe/H] of 0.1 dex or in helium abundance of \u2206Y = 0.026, if\neach of the two is assumed to act alone. We are not suggesting that such spreads exist; we\nmerely state upper limits to what might be present.\nWe note that if we just increase the He abundance, there will be no appreciable effect\non the SGB luminosity. Helium alone cannot explain the observed SGB split. On the other\nhand, a population 0.2 dex more metal rich would have an SGB that is fainter by \u223c 0.12\nmagnitude, and therefore it would be able to explain the SGB split. However, such a high\ndifference in [Fe/H] is ruled out by the narrowness of the MS. We have also looked at the color\ndistribution of the red giant branch (RGB) and found no evidence of a split, and found an\nRGB color dispersion consistent with the photometric error, confirming that any dispersion\nin [Fe/H] alone must be much smaller than 0.2 dex.\nNote, however, that increasing [Fe/H] makes the MS redder, while increasing helium\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- As in Fig. 6, but for the HB.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nmakes the MS bluer. Thus if, as a mere working hypothesis, one increases [Fe/H] by 0.2 dex\n(enough to explain the SGB split), while changing Y from 0.247 to 0.30, then the two effects\ncancel each other out, and the MS would have the same color. The same would happen\non the RGB: an [Fe/H] content 0.2 dex higher would move the RGB to the red, but the\nRGB would be moved to the original color in the presence of a He content Y \u223c 0.30. In\nthis way we would be able to reconcile the SGB split with the low dispersions in the MS\nand RGB. (Clearly, this kind of conspiracy cannot be ruled out till we have high-resolution\nspectra to measure the metal content of the NGC 1851 stars.) However, there is additional\nobservational evidence which seems to rule out such an unlikely coincidence. A change in\n[Fe/H] of +0.2 dex would imply an HB 0.03\u20130.04 magnitude fainter, while the suggested Y\nenhancement would end with a bluer HB that is \u223c 0.2 magnitude brighter. The resulting\nsloping of the horizontal branch is not observed in Fig. 7.\nThe only remaining possibility of explaining the SGB split is therefore to assume that\nin NGC 1851 there are two stellar populations with similar metallicity and He content, but\nwith different ages. Figure 5 shows that the two SGBs are separated vertically by \u223c 0.1\nmagnitude in F606W. Comparison with the theoretical models of Dotter et al. (2007) shows\nthat this separation corresponds to an age difference of \u223c 1 Gyr, with the fSGB older than\nthe bSGB.\n\n7.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have shown that the SGB of the Galactic GC NGC 1851 is split into\ntwo distinct branches. If the split is interpreted in terms of age, its width implies that the\ntwo populations were formed at epochs separated by \u223c 1 Gyr. As discussed in the previous\nsection, the age difference seems a possible explanation for the peculiar SGB.\nThe SGB split is not the only observational evidence of the presence of more than one\npopulation in NGC 1851, though it is probably the clearest one. We have already noted that\nNGC 1851 has a bimodal HB, and that there might be a connection between the two SGBs\nand the two HB sections. The relative frequency of stars in the different branches implies\nthat the progeny of the bSGB are in the red part of the HB, while the progeny of the fSGB\nare on the blue side of the instability strip. This is what one would expect qualitatively from\nstellar evolution models, though an age difference of only 1 Gyr is not enough to move stars\nfrom the red to the blue side of the HB. Our models indicate that to move stars from the red\nto the blue side of the RR Lyrae gap would require an age difference of \u223c 2\u20133 Gyr. Some\nadditional parameter, or combination of parameters, must be at work in order to explain the\nmorphology of the HB of NGC 1851.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nThere is another relevant observational fact that must be mentioned. Hesser et al.\n(1982) found that three out of eight of their bright RGB stars show \"extraordinarily strong\"\nCN bands. These stars also show enhanced Sr II and Ba II lines, and lie systematically\non the red side of the RGB. In other words, \u223c40% of their sample of bright RGB stars\ncontains CNO-processed material. This material could come from the interior of these stars\nthrough mixing processes, but after what we have learned from \u03c9 Cen and NGC 2808 we\ncannot exclude the possibility that this processed material comes from a first generation of\nstars that polluted the gas from which the CN-strong stars have formed. This hypothesis\nwould be further supported if Sr and Ba are also confirmed to be enhanced (as the spectra\nof Hesser et al. [1982] seem to imply), as these elements cannot be produced in the low-mass\nstars presently on the RGB of NGC 1851.\nUnfortunately, the results by Hesser et al. (1982) are based on a very limited sample of\nstars; a more extended spectroscopic investigation is clearly needed. Meanwhile, it is rather\ninstructive to look at the CMD published by Grundahl et al. (1999), based on Str\u00f6mgren\nphotometry. Among the 15 CMDs in their Fig. 1, NGC 1851 shows by far the broadest RGB,\nwith some hint of a bimodality. This bimodality is not visible in our narrow-color-baseline\nF606W vs. F606W \u2212 814W CMD, but the capability of Str\u00f6mgren photometry to distinguish\nstellar populations with different metal content (in particular CN content) is well known, and\nthe CMD of Grundahl et al. (1999) tends to confirm the results of Hesser et al. (1982). We\nhave investigated the possibility that an enhancement of C or N, or of both elements, can be\nthe cause of the observed SGB split. Hesser et al. (1982) found that model spectra with [C/A]\n= +0.2 and [N/A] = +0.5 (where they define [A/H] as the logarithmic relative abundance\nof all heavy elements in the theoretical models), or else model spectra with with [C/A] =\n0 and [N/A] = +1.0 could fit the observed spectra equally well. A detailed analysis of the\neffect of C and N overabundances is beyond the scope of the present paper. Furthermore,\nbefore such an analysis is justified we will need better abundance constraints, which would\nrequire fitting a larger sample of stellar spectra with modern atmospheric models.\nHere we note that one possible consequence for a second generation of stars is indeed\nan increased CNO abundance from mass lost after the third dredge-up in intermediatemass AGB stars from an earlier generation (see discussion in Ventura & D'Antona 2005 and\nKarakas et al. 2006). The spectroscopic results of Hesser et al. (1982) suggest enhanced\nlevels of C and N but do not include an analysis of the oxygen abundance, due to a lack\nof measurable features in the spectra. (This further underlines the need for a new study.)\nIt is however possible that the C + N + O amount is enhanced to some extent, though at\nthe moment we cannot quantify this enhancement. The CNO enhancement is an important\nobservational input, as the level of enhancement would allow us to better identify the possible\npolluters from the first generation of stars.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nThe presence of CNO enhancement would affect the age difference between the two\npopulations. A CNO enhancement of +0.3 dex would reduce the age difference between the\ntwo SGBs to 300\u2013500 Myr. Under this hypothesis, we estimate a gap in the SGB of \u223c 0.07\nmagnitude due to the composition alone, and an additional 0.03\u20130.05 mag displacement due\nto the age difference, fully accounting for the observed magnitude difference between the two\nSGBs.\nLarger CNO enhancements would further reduce the age gap between the two generations of stars, down to a few hundred Myr, as expected in the intermediate-mass-AGB-star\npollution scenario (Ventura et al. 2002). We note that if the CNO enhancement in secondgeneration stars of NGC 1851 is confirmed, NGC 1851 might differ from other globular\nclusters, in which the sum of CNO elements for normal and self-enriched stars seems to be\nconstant (Cohen & Melendez 2005). New spectroscopy of stars in NGC 1851, along with\nthe photometry presented in this paper and detailed modeling, can significantly improve our\nunderstanding of this intriguing situation.\nNGC 1851 is the third globular cluster for which we have direct evidence of multiple\nstellar generations. All three clusters seem to differ in several important respects, however:\n\u2022 In \u03c9 Cen, the multiple populations manifest themselves both in a main-sequence split\n(interpreted as a bimodal He abundance; see Bedin et al. 2004, Norris 2004, and Piotto\net al. 2005) and in a multiplicity of SGBs (interpreted in terms of large age variations,\n\u226b 1 Gyr; see Villanova et al. 2007, and references therein), which implies at least four\ndifferent stellar groups within the same cluster.\n\u2022 In NGC 2808, the multiple generation of stars is inferred from the presence of three\nMSs (interpreted in this case too in terms of three groups of stars characterized by\ndifferent helium contents; see discussion in Piotto et al. 2007), and further confirmed\nby the presence of three groups of stars with different oxygen abundances. It is also\nconsistent with the presence of a multiple HB (D'Antona & Caloi 2004). However, in\nNGC 2808 the TO-SGB regions are so narrow that any difference in age between the\nthree stellar groups must be significantly smaller than 1 Gyr.\n\u2022 In the case of NGC 1851, we have evidence of two stellar groups from the SGB split,\nwhich apparently implies two stellar generations, formed with a time separation of \u223c 1\nGyr. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the presence of a group of RGB stars with\nstrong CN bands (distinct from the majority of CN-normal RGB stars), and enhanced\nSr and Ba, and possibly the presence of a bimodal HB. In the case of NGC 1851 there\nis no evidence of MS splitting, which implies that any difference in helium or other\nheavier element content between the two populations should be small.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nApparently, not only are GCs not single-stellar-population objects, containing stars\nformed in a single star burst, but the evidence emerging from the new exciting HST observations presented in this paper - as well as from the HST observations of \u03c9 Cen and NGC\n2808 - is that the star-formation history of a globular cluster can vary strongly from cluster\nto cluster. We are still far from understanding what governs the different star-formation\nhistories, and this is an exciting and challenging question for future investigations. At the\nmoment, we can only note that the three clusters in which multiple generations of stars\nhave been clearly identified (\u03c9 Cen, NGC 2808, and NGC 1851), and the two other clusters\nstrongly suspected to contain more than one stellar generation (NGC 6388 and NGC 6441;\nsee Caloi & D'Antona 2007, and Busso et al. 2007) are among the ten most massive clusters\nin our Galaxy. This evidence suggests that cluster mass might have a relevant role in the\nstar-formation history of GCs.\nWe should note finally that the cases of \u03c9 Centauri and M54, both probably associated\nwith mergers of other galaxies into the Milky Way, suggest the possibility that all globular\nclusters that have complexities in their CMDs are likewise merger remnants. This is an\nattractive speculation, but we think that it does not yet have enough observational support.\nThe authors wish to thank the referee, Francesca D'Antona, for useful discussions.\nThe USA authors acknowledge the support for Program number GO-10775 provided by\nNASA through a grant from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the\nAssociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Incorporated, under NASA contract\nNAS5-26555.\n\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, J., & King, I.
