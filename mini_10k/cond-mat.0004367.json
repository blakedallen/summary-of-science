In this work, we have\nmeasured thermal conductivity \u03ba at very low temperatures, using lightly Mg-doped samples. The samples\nare cooled down to 3 He temperatures, in order to study\nthe low-lying excitations. The thermal conductivity of\nthe doped samples exceeds that of the pure sample at\nthe lowest temperature. We will show that the in-gap\nmagnons, which is intrinsic to D-AF phase, indeed exist\nand are responsible for the excess low-temperature heat\ntransport in the doped samples.\nThe Cu1\u2212x Mgx GeO3 single crystals were grown with\na floating-zone method. The Mg-concentration is determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).14,15 For the thermal conductivity measurement, we use pure, x = 0.016, and\nx = 0.0216 samples, all of which were already well characterized using dc susceptibility and synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction measurements.14\u201316 The transition temperatures are shown in Table I for each sample.

When\nthe disorder is introduced by the non-magnetic impurity, antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering immediately appears without destroying the spin-gap feature, commonly\nin a spin-Peierls (SP) compound CuGeO3 ,1\u20135 a ladder\ncompound SrCu2 O3 ,6 and a newly found Haldane system PbNi2 V2 O8 .7,8 Since it was believed that spin-singlet\nstate and antiferromagnetism are mutually exclusive, the\ncase of CuGeO3 , in which both the remaining SP ordering and the AF ordering developing with impuritydoping turned out to be long-range order,3 is remarkable.\nFukuyama et al. proposed a theoretical model for this\nanomalous phase, i.e., dimerized antiferromagnetic (DAF) phase.9 In their model, staggered AF moments and\nlattice dimerization are spatially modulated, keeping the\nAF and SP long-range correlations; degree of the lattice\ndimerization is larger in between the impurity sites than\naround the impurity sites and magnitude of the staggered\nmoments are larger near the impurity sites.\nEven though the coexistence of the two long-range orders are established in lightly-doped CuGeO3 , it is to be\nelucidated how low-energy spin excitations of SP state,\nwhich holds spin gap, and those of AF state, which is\ngapless in isotropic systems, compromise with each other\nin D-AF phase. Recently, Saito and Fukuyama extended\nthe theory of Ref. 9 and predicted that a \"slow\" gapless AF-magnon branch shows up in addition to the\ngapped SP mode when impurity is doped.10 They predicted that the energy scale of the magnon branch is\nsmaller than the SP gap (\u223c 24 K). Existence of this ingap magnon branch is observed by neutron scattering\nfor rather highly substituted samples.11\u201313 (Zn concentration was 3.2% for the sample used in Ref. 11, for example).

In Fig. 1(b), \u03ba in the temperature range below 0.58 K (T 3 < 0.2 K3 ) is plotted as\na function of T 3 . \u03ba of the pure sample rapidly decreases\nwith decreasing temperature and becomes proportional\nto T 3 below 0.58 K. At 1.3 K, \u03ba of the x = 0.016 sample\nis smaller than that of the pure sample, so that our previous results in higher temperature range are reproduced.19\nIt is natural that \u03ba is suppressed in the presence of impurities owing to the scattering by disorders. However, \u03ba\nof the x = 0.016 sample exceeds that of the pure sample\nbelow 1 K down to the lowest temperature, which is not\nexplained by the above simple picture.\nFirst, let us discuss \u03ba of the pure sample. Magnetic excitations are negligible in the pure sample below 1.3 K,\nbecause the spin-gap energy of CuGeO3 is more than\none order of magnitude larger than the temperatures.20\nTherefore, the heat is dominantly carried by phonons\nthere. Assuming kinetic approximation, the phonon thermal conductivity \u03baph is written as\n\nCu1-xMgx GeO3 Sample A\n(x = 0)\n\n1.5\nSample B\n(x = 0.016)\n\n1\n0.5\n\n(a)\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nT [K]\n\n\u03ba [W / m K]\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\nSample B\n(x = 0.016)\n\n0.15\n0.1\n\nSample A\n(x = 0)\n\n0.05\n0\n\n(b)\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n0.15\n\n\u03baph =\n\n0.2\n\nT [K ]\n\n1\nCph vph lph ,\n3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Cph is specific heat, vph is velocity and lph is mean\nfree path of the phonons. Since Cph also depends on\ntemperature as T 3 at such low temperatures, lph should\nbe independent of temperature below 0.58 K. This result\nmeans that the phonon conductivity reaches the Casimir\nlimit, where the mean free path is determined simply by\nthe dimension of the crystal.17,18,21 For a rectangularshaped crystal lph is given as\n\nFIG. 1.

(b)\nThermal conductivity of the same sample as a function of T 3 .\nThe dashed lines show that \u03ba is proportional to T 3 below\n0.58 K for Sample A.\n\na microchip heater and two calibrated RuO sensors, are\nattached on the samples by GE-varnish. Temperature\ndifference between the two thermometers are typically\n3% of the sample temperature. Since we will discuss\nthe thermal conductivity in the low-temperature limit\n(Casimir's limit),17,18 where heat carriers are scattered\ndominantly by crystalline boundaries, we paid special attention both to the sample size and to the smoothness of\nthe boundaries. Typical dimension along the c-axis is\naround 3 mm and thermal gradient is applied along the c\naxis. As shown in Table I, the geometrical mean widths w\u0304\n(square root of the cross section), which is proportional\nto the mean free path in the Casimir's limit,17 of the\npure sample (Sample A) and one of the x = 0.016 samples (Sample B) are set identical for direct comparison in\n\u03ba. The smooth boundaries of the crystal is achieved by\ncleaving for the b-c surfaces and by cutting with a sharp\nrazor blade for the a-c surfaces. Also, we have measured\nspecific heat C, in order to derive the mobility of the\nrelevant heat carriers. The specific heat measurement is\ncarried out down to 0.4 K with the commercial PPMS\n(Quantum Design) heat-capacity probe, using a relaxation method. The mass of the samples is typically 3 mg.\nThe samples used for the specific heat and the thermal\nconductivity measurements are cut from the same piece\n\nlph = 1.12w\u0304,\n\n(2)\n\nassumimg isotropic phonons.22 We have measured the\nspecific heat independently and examined the validity\nof Eqs. (1) and (2). First, vph is calculated from \u03ba\nand C data by Eqs. (1) and (2), as vph = (3\u03ba)/(C *\n1.12w\u0304) \u223c 1600 m/s.23 On the other hand, vph can be\nestimated only from the low-temperature C data, assuming the Debye model. Thus obtained value of vph is\n\u223c 1800 m/s, which is in good agreement with the estimation from the \u03ba data. The result shows that the relation\nof Eqs. (1) and (2) is satisfied at the temperatures shown\nin Fig. 1(b) for the crystal used.\nNoting that phonon conductivity governed by the\nboundary scattering gives the maximum value of \u03baph (any\nadditional scattering would suppress the conductivity),\nwe can notice that \u03baph of Sample B cannot exceed \u03ba of\nSample A in Fig. 1(b), using Eqs. (1) and (2), because\nw\u0304 of Sample A and B is identical (Table I) and little\nx dependence is expected for Cph and vph . Therefore,\nthe result of the excess \u03ba in Sample B requires an additional excitations which can carry heat at low temperatures down to 0.28 K in the Mg-doped sample. Considering the AF ordering in the impurity-doped CuGeO3 , it is\n2\n\n\fmost likely that antiferromagnetic magnons are responsible for this excess low-temperature heat conductivity in\nthe Mg-doped sample.\n\n150\n\n0\n1.5\n\nSample B\n\n0.12\n\nSample B\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.1\nSample C\n(x 1.03)\n0.1\nT 3 [K3]\n\n0.2\n\nSample B\n(x = 0.016)\n\n100\n\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n\nSample A\n(x = 0)\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n3\n\n0.15\n\n0.02\n\n2\n\n0\n0.2\n\n3\n\nT [K ]\nFIG. 2.

On the other hand, as shown in the\nlower inset, the low-temperature \u03ba/w\u0304 data (T 3 < 0.1 K)\nof the two samples show only 3% difference, which is\nmainly due to the error in determining the distance between the gold wires connected to the thermometers.\nSince the result means that \u03ba differs in proportion to\nw\u0304 at low temperatures, it is strongly suggested that the\nCasimir's condition is satisfied for both samples and that\nboth \u03baph and the magnon heat transport \u03bam are governed\nby the boundary scattering there, i.e.,\n\n(a)\n1.6\n1.2\n\nSample D\n(x = 0.0216)\n\n0.8\nSample A\n(x = 0)\n\n0.4\n\nC [J / m3 K]\n\n0\n140\n\n(b)\n\n120\n100\n\nSample D\n(x = 0.0216)\n\n80\n60\n40\n\nSample A\n(x = 0)\n\n20\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n3\n\n0.15\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0.2\n\n\u03bamag / w [kW / m2 K]\n\n200\n\n0.1\n\n0.14\n\n\u03ba / w [kW / m2 K]\n\nC [J / m3 K]\n\n250\n\n0.3 Sample C\n0.2\n\n\u03bamag [W / m K]\n\n300\n\n\u03ba / w [kW / m2 K] \u03ba [W / m K]\n\n350\n\nof magnitude smaller than that of the Mg-doped samples, we can neglect Cph and assume Cm \u223c C for the\ndoped sample. \u03bam of the x = 0.016 sample is estimated\nby subtracting \u03ba of the pure sample and is plotted together in Fig. 2. The \u03bam (T ) data show exactly the same\ntemperature dependence as the C(T ) data below 0.46 K\n(T 3 < 0.1 K), indicating again that Eq. (3) is satisfied in\nthis temperature range. Assuming Jc \u223c 10Jb \u223c 100|Ja |\nc\nand \u03b1c \u223c 0.1,24 vm\nis estimated approximately to be\n70 m/s from Eq. (3). The AF-magnon energy is lower\nc\nthan qc vm\n\u223c 0.12 meV [qc (= \u03c0/4c) is the wave number\nat the center of the Brillouin zone and c (= 2.9 \u00c5) is\nthe distance between adjacent Cu atoms along the Cu-O\nchain]. Since this value is two orders of magnitude lower\nthan the SP gap (\u2206SP \u223c 2 meV), we can conclude that\nthe additional heat transport observed in the Mg-doped\nCuGeO3 is due to the in-gap AF-magnons.25\n\n3\n\nT [K ]\nFIG. 3.

(3), we can crudely estimate vm\nwith the\nvalue of Cm obtained by the independent specific-heat\nmeasurement and examine whether the magnon branch\nis in the SP gap. The specific heat of Samples A and B\nis shown in Fig. 2 as a function of T 3 in the temperature range below \u223c 0.58 K3 (T 3 < 0.2 K). Since C of\nthe pure sample (diamonds in Fig. 2), which represents\nCph in this temperature region, is more than one order\n\u03bam =\n\nThe magnon velocity can be estimated also for the\nx = 0.0216 sample (Sample D) in the same manner. In\norder to subtract \u03baph , it is convenient to compare \u03ba/w\u0304\nof Sample D to that of Sample A, which represents the\nphonon contribution. \u03ba/w\u0304 of Samples A and D is plotted against T 3 in Fig. 3(a). \u03ba/w\u0304 of Sample D is larger\nthan that of the pure sample. The difference corresponds\nto the magnon contribution \u03bam /w\u0304 of Sample D. In Fig.\n3(b), \u03bam /w\u0304 and independently obtained C data are plotted together. Following the same discussion as that for\nc\nthe x = 0.016 sample, vm\nis estimated approximately\nto be 140 m/s. The upper limit of the magnon energy\n3\n\n\fc\nqc vm\nis \u223c 0.23 meV, which is twice as high as that of the\nx = 0.016 sample but is still much lower than the \u2206SP .\n\n1\n\nM. Hase, N.

However, such\nincoherent excitations do not contribute to heat transport.\nAlso, magnetic specific heat is negligibly small, as will be\nshown later (Fig. 2).\n21\nDefect scattering would give T -dependence of the mean\nfree path. Since scattering rate \u0393 of the defect scattering\ndecreases with temperature, it will exceed \u0393 of the boundary scattering at the low-T limit, so that the Casimir's\ncondition is satisfied. See Ref. 18, p. 73, for example.\n22\nP. D. Thacher, Phys.

Even when quantum fluctuations, which diminish the effective value of S to 0.2\ntimes smaller,27 is taken into account, the magnon velocity of as fast as \u223c 1000 m/s is expected, (assuming\nc\nJc = 120 K).24 Since we obtained much smaller vm\n, it\nis shown that effective S is significantly suppressed owing to the SP ordering. In the model of Refs. 9 and\n10, the staggered moment is strongly suppressed in between the impurity sites. As the result, a sort of spatially\n\"averaged\" spin, which is directly proportional to the\nmagnon velocity, becomes much smaller than 1/2. Our\nc\ncrude estimation from the low-temperature \u03ba gives vm\nof\nthe x = 0.0216 sample approximately twice as large as\nc\nthat of the x = 0.016 sample, indicating that vm\nrapidly\nincreases with x. Such x dependence is consistent with\nc\nthe calculation in Ref. 10. Note that vm\nof around 1300\nm/s can be estimated for the Zn-3.2%-doped sample from\nthe neutron data,11 which is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the value estimated for our x = 0.0216\nsample.\nIt should be emphasized that the mean free path\nof the AF-magnon in the SP gap reaches as long as\n1.12\u03b1c w\u0304 \u223c 18 \u03bcm, according to Eq. (3), i.e., the magnons\nare mobile to a distance 60,000 times longer than the\nspin-distance (c) without being scattered. Such coherent\nmotion of the magnons is only possible with extremely\nlong correlation length of the corresponding magnetic\norder.28 Therefore, the mixture of SP and AF ordering in\nthe doped CuGeO3 is certainly a true long-range order.\nIn summary, we have measured thermal conductivity\nof pure and Mg-doped CuGeO3 single crystals at very\nlow temperatures, in order to examine the anomalous\nlow-temperature phase in the impurity-doped CuGeO3 ,\nwhere SP and AF order coexists. While the lowtemperature thermal conductivity is dominated by \u03baph\nin the pure CuGeO3 , magnons also carry considerable\namount of heat in the Mg-doped samples. Estimating the\nmagnon velocity, we have shown that the AF-magnons\nare present in the SP gap, as predicted by Saito and\nFukuyama. It is demonstrated that thermal conductivity\nis a powerful tool in elucidating the low-energy magnetic\nexcitations in the disorder-induced AF phase of spin-gap\nsystems. Our next step is to examine the excitations in\nthe uniform AF phase in highly substituted CuGeO3 , and\nto seek differences from that of D-AF phase.\nWe acknowledge H.
