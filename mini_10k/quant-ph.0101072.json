Since this behavior justifies that the superpositions of atomic coherent states are relevant with respect to\nthe original problem of Schr\u00f6dinger, such a superposition is\nrightly called an atomic Schr\u00f6dinger cat state [21\u201323]. We\nalso note that there are several proposals for the experimental preparation of these type of states [24,25].\nNext, in section IV we present the decoherence and dissipation properties of atomic Schr\u00f6dinger cat states, based on\nnumerical computations of their time evolution. The time\nscales of decoherence and dissipation differ by orders of magnitude. Using this fact, we show how one can make a clear\ndistinction between these two processes despite of the interplay between them, and we define the characteristic time of\ndecoherence. This decoherence time strongly depends on the\ninitial conditions, notably, it is particularly large for a special\nset of initial cat states [22,26]. This will be termed as slow\ndecoherence in contrast with the general case which will be\nreferred to as rapid decoherence.\nThe interplay between decoherence and energy dissipation\nis the most appreciable in connection with the concept of\npointer states [3]. It will be shown that when the decoherence is rapid, then the constituent coherent states of the\ninitial state are pointer states to a very good approximation. However, when there is enough time for dissipation,\ni.e. when decoherence is slow, then the initial atomic coherent states themselves evolve into mixtures, and therefore a\nrefined scheme of decoherence holds.\nIn order to underline the contrast between rapid and slow\ndecoherence we superpose four atomic coherent states corresponding to the vertices of a suitably oriented tetrahedron.\nThe time evolution of this four component cat state will be\nstudied by the aid of the spherical Wigner function in section\nV. As it is expected, the interaction with the environment selects that pair from the initial superposition which constitutes\na long-lived cat state.\n\nWe investigate the time evolution of a superposition of\nmacroscopically distinct quantum states in a system of twolevel atoms interacting with a thermal environment of photon modes.

INTRODUCTION\nThe apparent lack of a superposition of macroscopically\ndistinct quantum states (Schr\u00f6dinger cats) has been an interesting and vivid problem since Schr\u00f6dinger's famous paper\n[1]. A successful approach, initiated by Zeh [2] and developed\nby Zurek [3], obtains the loss of quantum coherence as the\nconsequence of the unavoidable interaction with the environment. Theoretical studies in this framework have investigated\na variety of model systems usually coupled to a collection of\nharmonic oscillators as an environment. Fundamental work\nhas been done on this subject in [4\u201310], for reviews see [11,12].\nImportant experiments have been carried out during the last\nyears [13\u201315] and the possible production of long-lived quantum superpositions has gained wide attention because of their\nexpected use in quantum computation [16].\nIn the present paper we investigate a system which is a candidate for the experimental study of decoherence and possibly\nalso for practical applications. The model to be described in\ndetail in section II, consists of several identical two-level atoms\n(the system) interacting with a large number of photon modes\nin a thermal state (the environment). It has the advantage\nthat it is simple to make the correct transition from a microscopic system to a macroscopic one by increasing the number\nof atoms. We analyze the evolution of the reduced density\nmatrix of the atomic system by the appropriate master equation [17\u201319]. One of the main results of the present work is\nthat we show how one and the same solution of this master\nequation describes both decoherence and dissipation.\nBy analytical short-time calculations we show in section\n\nII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL\nWe consider a system of identical two-level atoms interacting with the environment of macroscopic number of photon\nmodes. With dipole interaction and in the rotating wave approximation the total system is described by the following\nmodel Hamiltonian:\nH = h\u0304\u03c9a Jz +\n\nX\nk\n\nh\u0304\u03c9k a\u2020k ak +\n\nX\nk\n\nh\u0304gk a\u2020k J\u2212 + ak J+ ,\n\n\u0001\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9a is the transition frequency between the two atomic\nenergy levels, \u03c9k denote the frequencies of the modes of the\nenvironment and gk are coupling constants. J+ , J\u2212 and Jz are\n\n1\n\n\fdimensionless collective atomic operators obeying the usual\nangular momentum commutation relations [27]. This Hamiltonian leads to the interaction picture master equation for the\nreduced density matrix of the atomic system, \u03c1 [17,18]:\n\n|\u03a8(0)i = |\u03c60 (0)i |0i ,\n\ni.e. p0 (0) = 1 and pk (0) = 0 for k 6= 0. Due to the interaction\nthis product state evolves into a more general Schmidt sum\nlike Eq. (3), or in other words it turns into an entangled state.\nThe time scale of this entanglement or de-separation can be\nobtained [29] in leading order of time as\n\n\u03b3\nd\u03c1(t)\n= \u2212 (hni + 1) (J+ J\u2212 \u03c1(t) + \u03c1(t)J+ J\u2212 \u2212 2J\u2212 \u03c1(t)J+ )\ndt\n2\n\u03b3\n\u2212 hni (J\u2212 J+ \u03c1(t) + \u03c1(t)J\u2212 J+ \u2212 2J+ \u03c1(t)J\u2212 ). (2)\n2\n\np0 (t) = 1 \u2212 At2 ,\n\nHere hni is the mean number of photons in the environment\nand \u03b3 denotes the damping rate. Note that the same master equation can be obtained by considering a low-Q cavity\ncontaining Rydberg atoms [19].\nIf the state of the atomic system was initially invariant with\nrespect to the permutations of the atoms, i.e. it was a superposition of the totally symmetric\nPDicke states [27], the\u0001dipole\ninteraction described by Hint = k h\u0304gk a\u2020k J\u2212 + ak J+ in (1)\nwould not destroy this symmetry. Therefore we may restrict\nour investigation of the N atom system to the totally symmetric N + 1 dimensional subspace of the whole Hilbert-space of\nthe atomic system. This subspace is isomorphic to an angular\nmomentum eigensubspace labeled by j = N/2. This model\nhas been proven to be valid in cavity QED experiments with\nmany atoms, as reviewed in [19].\nThe environment as a static reservoir (represented by\nthe thermal photon modes) continuously interacts with the\natomic system influencing its dynamics. As it is obvious, the\ndissipation of the energy leads to thermal equilibrium in the\nsystem, corresponding to the stationary solution of the master\nequation (2). However, as it will be shown here, the same master equation describes also a much more interesting process.\nThe continuous \"monitoring\" [3] of the atomic system by the\nenvironment results in the total loss of the coherence of the\nquantum superpositions in the system. This decoherence process is generally extremely fast compared to the dissipation,\nexcept for special initial conditions which will be discussed in\nsubsection IV A.\n\nA=\n\npk (t) |\u03c6k (t)i |\u03a6k (t)i ,\n\nX\n\n|h\u03c6k (0)| h\u03a6l (0)| Hint |\u03c60 (0)i |0i|2 .\n\n(6)\n\nk6=0,l6=0\n\nThis quantity can be called the rate of entanglement. Using the explicit form of the interaction Hamiltonian Hint , a\nstraightforward calculation leads to\nA = C (J+ , J\u2212 ) := hJ+ J\u2212 i \u2212 hJ+ i hJ\u2212 i ,\n\n(7)\n\ni.e. in our system the rate of entanglement is the normally\nordered correlation function of the operators J+ and J\u2212 .\nLet us turn to the case of finite temperatures, when the\ntotal system has to be represented by a mixed state even at\nt = 0. The linear entropy, defined as\nSlin = Tr(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c12 ),\n\n(8)\n\ncan be regarded as a relevant measure of decoherence [12,31].\nRestricting ourselves again to the initial regime of the time\nevolution, we can make use of the master equation (2) and\ncalculate the time derivative of the linear entropy at t = 0:\n\n\u0010 \u2202S \u0011\nlin\n\n\u2202t\n\n= \u03b3 (hni C (J\u2212 , J+ ) + (hni + 1) C (J+ , J\u2212 )) . (9)\nt=0\n\nThe normally (antinormally) ordered correlation function, C (J+ , J\u2212 ) (C (J\u2212 , J+ )), disappears in the eigenstate\n|j, m = \u2212ji (|j, m = ji) of J\u2212 (J+ ). However, the collective\natomic operators J\u2212 and J+ have no simultaneous eigenstates\nwhich would annullate the right hand side of Eq. (9). Nevertheless, we are going to show that if the number of atoms\nN = j/2 is large enough, then the correlation functions in Eq.\n(9) are negligible in a class of states called atomic coherent\nstates [20]. These states are labeled by a complex parameter\n\u03c4 = tan(\u03b2/2) exp(\u2212i\u03c6) (for the angles \u03b2 and \u03c6 see Fig. 1) and\ncan be expanded in terms of the eigenstates of the operator\nJz (Dicke states) as\n\nIn this section we apply general concepts to our system\nin order to find the initial states for the master equation (2)\nwhich are relevant to the original problem of Schr\u00f6dinger [1]\nconcerning the unobservability of macroscopic superpositions.\nFirst we consider the short-time behavior of the total system. The (by assumption pure) system+environment state,\n|\u03a8i can be written in the Schmidt representation [28\u201330,12]\nat any time as\n|\u03a8(t)i =\n\n(5)\n\nwith\n\nIII. THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE TIME\nEVOLUTION\n\nXp\n\n(4)\n\n|\u03c4 i =\n\n\u0012\nj\nX\n\nm=\u2212j\n\n2j\nj+m\n\n\u0013 21\n\n\u03c4 j+m\n|j, mi.\n(1 + |\u03c4 |2 )j\n\n(10)\n\nFor large j, the atomic coherent states are approximate\neigenstates of the operators J\u2212 and J+ [20,26]. This statement is understood in the sense that the square of the cosine\nof the angle \u03b1 between |\u03c4 i and J\u2212 |\u03c4 i:\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nwhere |\u03c6k i and |\u03a6k i are elements of certain orthonormal bases\n(Schmidt bases) of the system and the environment, respectively.\nAt zero temperature the photon field of the present model\nis in its pure vacuum state |0i, therefore the initial state factorizes as\n\ncos2 \u03b1 =\n\n|h\u03c4 |J\u2212 | \u03c4 i|2\nh\u03c4 | \u03c4 i h\u03c4 |J+ J\u2212 | \u03c4 i\n\n(11)\n\ndiffers from unity by a factor which scales as (j\u03c4 2 )\u22121 . Thus\n\u03b1 becomes negligible in the j \u2192 \u221e limit for finite \u03c4 [26].\nThe same statement holds for the operator J+ , therefore both\n\n2\n\n\fcorrelation functions in Eq. (9) are indeed negligible in the\natomic coherent states (10).\nThis suggests that the atomic coherent states are rather\nstable against the decoherence induced by the photon modes,\ni.e. they can serve as a model of classical-like macroscopic\nquantum states. This result is in analogy with the stability\nof the oscillator coherent states obtained in [31].\nTwo such states, |\u03c41 i and |\u03c42 i can be considered as macroscopically distinct, whenever the distance between the parameters \u03c41 and \u03c42 is sufficiently large on the complex plane. This\nimplies that the coherent superposition of these states, which\nwill be introduced in the next section, yields an appropriate\nmodel of the original paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nA. Time scales\nA typical result of the numerical integration of Eq. (2) is\nthat the time evolution of the states given by Eq. (12) can\nbe characterized by two different time scales, as illustrated by\nFig. 2, where the linear entropy and the energy of the atomic\nsystem is plotted versus time.\n\nN=500, <n>=1\n0,8\n\n\u03b22\n\n\u03c61\n\u03b21\n\nSlin\n\nDecoherence\n\n-150\n\ntd\n-160\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n-4\n\nt (10 /\u03b3)\n\nFIG. 2.

DECOHERENCE OF ATOMIC\nSCHR\u00d6DINGER CATS\n\n|\u03c41 i + |\u03c42 i\n\n-120\n\nAs we can see, there exists a time instant td (marked with\nan arrow in Fig. 2) when the character of the physical process\nchanges radically. Initially Slin (t) increases rapidly while the\ndissipated energy of the atoms is just a small fraction of that\npart of the energy which will eventually be transferred to\nthe environment. On the other hand, for longer times t \u226b\ntd both curves change on the same time scale. The energy\nof the atomic system decays exponentially as a function of\ntime allowing for identifying the characteristic time of the\ndissipation tdiss , with the inverse of the exponent. (We note\nthat in Fig. 2 the plotted time interval is much shorter than\ntdiss , thus the exponential behavior is not seen.) More detailed\ncalculations have shown that for high temperatures energy\nand linear entropy exhibit similar exponential behavior in the\nsecond regime of the time evolution. Their exponents coincide\nwith 2-3% relative error. This implies that the initial stage\nof the time evolution is dominated by decoherence while after\ntd the dissipation determines the dynamics. Accordingly we\ndefine the characteristic time of the decoherence as the instant\nwhen the slope of the curve Slin (t) decreases appreciably. We\nnote that td defined in this way is in accordance with the\ndecoherence time defined previously in [22] for a specific initial\nstate.\nIt is remarkable that although a few hundred atoms do not\nreally constitute a macroscopic system, the difference of the\ntime scales is obviously seen in Fig. 2. It is generally true\nthat the larger N is, the more naturally and sharply the time\nevolution splits into two regimes.\nNow we turn to the investigation of the dependence of the\ndecoherence time td on the initial conditions.\n\n\u03c41\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1.

The\nnumber of atoms is N = 500 and the average number of photons is hni = 1.\nThe distance between the actual density matrix \u03c1(t) and\n\u03c1cl , defined with\nD (\u03c1(t), \u03c1cl ) = Tr (\u03c1(t) \u2212 \u03c1cl )2 ,\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n(15)\n\nis always decreasing fast. Except for the case of slowly decohering cat states which will be discussed below, D (\u03c1(t), \u03c1cl )\nreaches its minimal value at the decoherence time, see Fig.\n4. This minimal value is very close to zero implying that the\ndensity matrix of the system at this instant is nearly the same\nas the classical density matrix (13). This fact justifies the definition of the characteristic time of the decoherence in section\nIV A, and it is in excellent agreement with the decoherence\nscheme (14).\nDue to the exceptionally slow decoherence, we have to modify this picture if the initial state is a symmetric superposition.\nIn this case the decoherence time is so long that the atomic\ncoherent constituents of the initial state are also appreciably\naffected by the time evolution until the decoherence time, td .\nThe state of the atomic system at td will be a mixture, which\nis the same as if the system had started from \u03c1cl at t=0. In\nother words the evolution follows the modified scheme:\n\nB. The direction of the decoherence\nWe saw in the previous subsection that the interplay between decoherence and dissipation is reflected in the time evolution of the superpositions given by Eq. (12). In this subsection we shall focus on the direction of the process resulting\nfrom the dynamics governed by the master equation (2).\nAccording to the general theory of environment induced decoherence [3,11,12,31,33], the interaction with a large number\nof degrees of freedom selects naturally the so-called pointer\nbasis [3] in the Hilbert-space of the system subject to decoherence. This process is claimed to favor the constituent states\nof the pointer basis in the sense that the system is driven\ntowards a classical statistical mixture of these states. Thus,\nfrom the present point of view \u03c1(td ) is the relevant quantity\nto be examined.\nRecalling the analytical results of sec. III, it seems plausible\nto expect that the atomic coherent states (10) will be pointer\nstates.\nBy introducing the density matrix which corresponds to\nthe classical statistical mixture of the initial coherent states:\n1\n(|\u03c41 ih\u03c41 | + |\u03c42 ih\u03c42 |) ,\n2\n\n0,3\n\n0,0\n\nFig. 3 shows the contour plot of the decoherence time versus the parameters \u03b21 and \u03b22 (see Fig. 1) of the initial atomic\nSchr\u00f6dinger cat state (12). We have set \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0 for simplicity. As we can see, the effect of decoherence is remarkably\nslower when \u03b21 \u2248 \u03b22 which was expected since in this case\nthe overlap of the two initial coherent states is not negligible, so these states can not be considered as \"macroscopically\ndistinct\". Much more surprising is the fact that cat states\nwhich were initially symmetric with respect to the (x, y) plane\n(i. e. \u03b21 \u2248 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b22 ) also decohere slower [22,32], but it is in accordance with the analytical estimations of Braun et. al. [26]\nIn the following sections we shall refer to these states as symmetric ones.\n\n\u03c1cl (\u03c41 , \u03c42 ) =\n\n0,4\n\nSlin\n\n0,0\n\nD(\u03c1,\u03c1cl)\n\n0,4\n\n0,0\n\n|\u03a812 ih\u03a812 | \u2192 \u03c1\u0303cl (\u03c41 , \u03c42 , t)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the time dependent classical density matrix \u03c1\u0303cl (\u03c41 , \u03c42 , t)\nis the one which would evolve from the statistical mixture (13)\n\u03c1cl (\u03c41 , \u03c42 ) = \u03c1\u0303cl (\u03c41 , \u03c42 , t = 0) according to the same master\nequation (2) as the actual atomic density matrix. The distance between the time dependent classical density matrix, \u03c1\u0303cl\nand \u03c1(t) becomes negligible at td , and asymptotically reaches\nzero for long times in the case of all the initial conditions.\n\n(13)\n\n4\n\n\ftion over the unit sphere (which is the appropriate phase space\nin the present case) being in a linear one-to-one correspondence with the density matrix of the atomic system.\nFollowing the construction of Agarwal [34], the Wigner\nfunction corresponding to a reduced density matrix \u03c1 of the\natomic system is defined as the expectation value of the operator kernel \u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6):\n\nV. WIGNER FUNCTIONS OF FOUR\nCOMPONENT SCHR\u00d6DINGER CAT STATES\nThe results of the previous section have shown that both\nthe characteristic time and the direction of the decoherence\nstrongly depend on the initial conditions. In this section we\nillustrate this fact by tracking the decoherence of the superposition of four atomic coherent states:\n|\u03c41 i + |\u03c42 i + |\u03c43 i + |\u03c44 i\n\n.\n|\u03a81234 i = p\nP\nh\u03c4 |\u03c4 i)\n2(2 + Re\ni>k i k\n\nW (\u03b8, \u03c6) = Tr (\u03c1\u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6)) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwith\n\nSince four points on the surface of a sphere are not distinguished with respect to each other if and only if they are the\nvertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in the sphere, we\nset the components of |\u03a81234 i according to this pattern. On\nthe other hand, the z axis is distinguished in the present model\nbecause of the form of the Hamilton operator (1), therefore\nwe orient the tetrahedron with one edge parallel to the z axis\nand the opposite edge parallel to the y axis, see Fig. 5. Although we have in principle two substantially different ways\nof considering the state represented by Fig. 5 as the superposition of two atomic Schr\u00f6dinger cat states, according to\nthe results of the previous section one expects that the environment naturally selects one of these possibilities via the\ndifferent time evolutions: the quantum coherence between the\ncomponents of the symmetric pair |\u03a812 i \u221d |\u03c41 i + |\u03c42 i disappears slowly, while all the other pairs are rapidly decohering\nsuperpositions.\n\n\u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\nN\nK\nX\nX\n\n\u2020\nTKQ\nYKQ (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n\n(19)\n\nK=0 Q=\u2212K\n\nHere the TKQ are the multipole operators and YKQ denote\nthe spherical harmonics [35]. For previous applications of the\nspherical Wigner function see [21,22,36\u201339].\nThe Wigner function (18) suggestively maps the time evolution of the state (17) onto the unit sphere, as shown in Fig.\n6. Here we present the state of the atomic system at three\ntime instants, and we plot the corresponding Wigner functions both as a polar plot and as a contour plot. Dark shades\nmean negative, light shades mean positive function values.\nThe four positive lobes, pointing from the center to the vertices of the tetrahedron shown in Fig. 5, correspond to the\nfour atomic coherent states in (17). Due to the dissipation\nall these lobes will move slowly downwards. The initial interference pattern (Figs. 6(a) and (b)) has the regularity of the\ntetrahedron, there are equally pronounced oscillations along\nall the edges, representing the quantum coherence between\nthe coherent states.\nFigs. 6(c) and (d) depict the situation after a time which\nis short in the sense that the the shapes of the lobes of the\ncoherent states are not appreciably affected (no dissipation),\nbut the interference is already negligible between them, except\nfor the single pair along the vertical edge of the tetrahedron.\nAs it is seen from Fig. 5 this is the pair which represented\ninitially the symmetric atomic Schr\u00f6dinger cat state \u221d |\u03c41 i +\n|\u03c42 i in (17). The coherence between the components of this\npair of states is nearly unaffected as shown by the strong\noscillations.\nA qualitatively different stage of the time evolution is\nshown in Figs. 6(e) and (f) at a later time. The coherent\nconstituents are already affected by the dissipation, the uppermost one rather strongly, but the quantum coherence between the components of the symmetric pair is still present.\nOn the contrary, the interference between all the other components has already disappeared.\n\nz\n\n\u03c41\ny\n\u03c43\n\nx\n\u03c42\n\n(18)\n\n\u03c44\n\nFIG. 5.

We plot the spherical Wigner function (18) both as\na polar plot (a, c, e) and as a contour plot (b, d, f). A polar plot is obtained by measuring the absolute value of the function\nin the corresponding direction, and the resulting surface is shown in light where the values of the Wigner function are positive,\nand in dark where they are negative. Similarly, light shades of the contour plot correspond to positive function values, while\ndark shades mean negative function values. Plots (a, b) show the initial state, i.e. the superpositon |\u03a81234 i (Eq. (17)) as shown\nin Fig. 5. In (a) we also label the lobes corresponding to the initial coherent constituents. Plots (c, d) show the spherical\nWigner function at t = 0.015/\u03b3, while plots (e, f) correspond to t = 0.04/\u03b3.\n\n7\n\n\fIn view of the present results, if the initial state of the\natomic system is a superposition of coherent states so that\nthere are symmetric pairs of coherent states in the expansion,\nthen the coherence between the components of these symmetric pairs will survive much longer than between any other\nterms.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n[1]\nWe have investigated the decoherence of superpositions of\nmacroscopically distinct quantum states in a system of twolevel atoms embedded in the environment of thermal photon\nmodes. Utilizing the Schmidt decomposition and the linear\nentropy, we have shown that atomic coherent states are robust\nagainst decoherence, both at zero and non-zero temperatures.\nThis result is in analogy with the harmonic oscillator case\nand justifies the definition of atomic Schr\u00f6dinger cat states as\nsuperpositions of atomic coherent states.\nBy solving the master equation (2) we have identified two\ndifferent regimes of the time evolution with the help of the linear entropy. The first one is dominated by decoherence while\nthe second one is governed by dissipation. Based on several computational runs focusing on the characteristic times\nit was found that td decreases much faster than tdiss as the\nfunction of the number of atoms, N . Consequently td becomes many orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic time of dissipation for macroscopical samples, and\neven for e.g. N = 500 atoms and an average photon number\nhni = 1 the ratio tdiss /td is around a few hundred depending\non the initial conditions. However, there are very important\nexceptional cases, called slow decoherence, when the atomic\ncoherent states constituting the initial atomic Schr\u00f6dinger cat\nstate are symmetric with respect to the equator of the Bloch\nsphere.\nUsing a new measure D, we have shown that at the characteristic time of decoherence the system is always very close\nto the state described by the time dependent classical density\nmatrix. Apart from the exceptional case of slow decoherence,\nthe coherent states appearing in (12) are approximate pointer\nstates. When due to its symmetry the initial cat state is a\nlong-lived superposition, also its constituent coherent states\nhave time to transform into mixtures until td . We have given\na modified scheme of decoherence which is valid also for slow\ndecoherence. Accordingly, the orthonormal pointer basis consists of the eigenstates of \u03c1\u0303cl (\u03c41 , \u03c42 , td ).\nWe have demonstrated the important difference between\nrapid and slow decoherence by tracking the time evolution of\na four component superposition with the help of the spherical\nWigner function. The initial interference pattern having the\nsymmetry of a tetrahedron rapidly disappears except for the\nsingle slowly decohering pair.\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n[24]\n\nThe authors thank F.
