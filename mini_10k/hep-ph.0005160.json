This solitons are associated with the nucleon\nand will be used for obtaining spatial structure information on baryons. Effectively, then, the\nbaryon or nucleon form factors can be extracted from the soliton model equations of motion.\nExperimentally measured form factors can be compared with these soliton predicted spatial\ndensities to test the model.\nThe present paper includes discussion of our recent work, extensions, and calculations\nof the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the generalized Skyrme model. This model\ninvolves the theoretical description of the dilaton-quarkonium scalar field and shows its importance in the description of soliton dynamics. We use \"dilaton-quarkonium\" scalar field\nto indicate the way we subdivide the gluon condensate in the calculation. This generalized\nmodel reproduces the experimental value of the nucleon mass, the input being the experimental value of the pion decay constant and the theoretically derived value of the Skyrme\nconstant, e = 2\u03c0.[1]. The naive, straightforward calculation of the electromagnetic form factors has shortcomings: the values of F\u03c0 and e give too small a nucleon size and the calculated\ncurves do not give the approximate dipole form factor values.\nThe generalized Skyrme model under consideration follows the formulation of Andrianov\net al. [2] This approach uses the framework of the joint chiral and conformal bosonization\nof the QCD Lagrangian, including chiral and scalar dilaton-quarkonium fields. In such a\nmodel the properties of the topological solitons are dramatically changed in numerical value\nfrom those in the original Skyrme model. Several authors have introduced an additional\nscalar field to the Skyrme model for different motivational reasons. For example, Riska\nand Schwesinger[3] appear to be the first to investigate the isospin independent part of the\nnucleon-nucleon spin-orbit interaction when a scalar field is added. A number of papers studied the effects a scalar \u03c3 meson would have by introducing it as a gluon condensate.[4],[5],[6],\nand also related, [2] and [7]. The purely theoretical and convincing reason is that with the\nintroduction of a scalar field, the conformal anomaly, one of the distinctive features of the\nQCD Lagrangian, is reproduced. In the SU(2) sector of this Lagrangian, one can construct\nan effective theory which reproduces the conformal anomaly in the framework of the effective Lagrangian method, introducing a field corresponding to scale invariance. As shown\nin [8], [9],and [10], it leads to the necessary strong attraction at intermediate internucleon\ndistances. In such an approach the starting point is the fermion integral over quark fields,\nin the low energy regime of QCD. The integral is specified by the finite mode regularization\nscheme with a cut-off that also plays the role of a low energy boundary. Performing the\njoint chiral and conformal bosonization on this integral leads to an effective action for chiral\nU(x) and dilaton \u03c3(x) fields. This Lagrangian favors the linear sigma model in terms of\nthe composite field U(x)exp(\u2212\u03c3(x)). The resulting effective Lagrangian[2], generalizing the\noriginal Skyrme Lagrangian is\nLef f (U, \u03c3) =\n\nF\u03c02\nexp(\u22122\u03c3)T r[\u2202\u03bc U\u2202 \u03bc U + ] +\n4\n2\n\n\fNf F\u03c02\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c3)2 exp(\u22122\u03c3) +\n4\n1\n+\nT r[\u2202\u03bc UU + , \u2202\u03bd UU + ]2 \u2212\n2\n128\u03c0\nCg Nf \u22124\u03c3\n4\n(e\n\u2212 1 + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b5\u03c3 ))\n48\n\u03b5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the pion decay constant is taken as the experimental value, F\u03c0 = 93MeV and Nf\nis the number of flavors. The gluon condensate, according to QCD sum rules, is Cg =\n(300 \u2212 400MeV )4 [11]. The first two terms are the kinetic terms for the chiral and scalar\nfields and the third term, the well-known Skyrme term. The effective potential for the scalar\nfield is the result of an extrapolation[2] of the low energy potential to high energies by use\nof a one-loop-approximation to the Gell-Mann Low QCD \u03b2 - function. The parameter \u03b5 is\ndetermined by the number of flavors Nf as \u03b5 = 8Nf /(33 \u2212 2Nf ).\n\n2\n\nThe Nucleon\n\nIn the baryon sector we choose the chiral field as the spherically symmetric ansatz of\nSkyrme and Witten, U(~x) = exp[\u2212i~\u03c4 ~nF (r)], where ~n = ~r/|~r|. It is convenient to introduce\na new field, \u03c1(x) = exp(\u2212\u03c3(x)).

The first calculation [1] in such a model yielded large deviations of the calculated form factors from\nthe dipole approximation formula. In the present work, we use the empirical value of the\npion decay constant and the theoretical value for the Skyrme term constant in the vector\nmeson dominance approach to obtain a good description of the form factor data in the finite\nrange of momentum transfer in the measurements. The vector mesons are included only as\nelements of the hadron substructure of the photon and are not considered as components of\nthe structure in the soliton self-dynamics. Implicit in the approach, though not explicitly\nproposed, is the possibility of having the role of vector mesons given by higher derivative\nterms in the effective Lagrangian for soliton dynamics [17]. For example, keeping terms to\nfour orders in the expansion of the effective Lagrangian would lead to a \u03c1 meson-like term\nand the sixth order terms would give \u03c9-like terms which are important in the calculations\nof the form factors at the larger momentum transfers.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.Nikolaev, O.Tkachev, V.Novozhilov, IL NUOVO CIMENTO, 1994, 107A(12), 2637.\n[2] Andrianov A.A., Andrianov V.A., Novozhilov Yu.V., Novozhilov V.Yu.
