Ce monopnictides, such as CeP and\nCeSb, are typical compounds, which show the very complicated phase diagram under the\nexternal field.1,2,3 Ce monopnictides are the semi-metals and the carrier concentrations are\nabout 0.01 per Ce ion, so that the Fermi surfaces of electrons and holes are very small.\nRecently, the Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds have also been investigated actively,\nbecause of the discovery of fascinating superconductivities and magnetic orders.4\nThe anomalous metal-insulator transition is observed in the Ce-based filled skutterudite\nCeOs4 Sb12 , where the charge density wave (CDW) or the spin density wave (SDW) transition\noccurs at 0.8 K with a gap opening of quasiparticle bands at low temperature region.5 The\nphase boundary shifts to the higher temperature region with an increase of the external\nmagnetic field,5,6 which is contrasted to the usual phase boundaries, which shift to the lower\ntemperature region by the field. CeOs4 Sb12 may also be considered as a low-carrier system\nwith the semi-metallic band structure.\nThe resistivity of CeOs4 Sb12 increases as \u03c1 \u223c T \u22120.56 even above the transition temperature\nwhen no magnetic field is applied6 , so that it seems that this material might be considered\nas an insulator. However, from the well-known relationship between the energy gaps and\nthe lattice constants6 , CeOs4 Sb12 should belong to the semi-metallic group. Therefore, we\nconsider that the basic band structure is a semi-metal, and the anomalous increase of the\nresistivity at low temperature may be due to disorder and/or magnetic impurity. Note that\ndisorder can affect the transport properties of small carrier system drastically. This problem\nis to be studied separately in the future.\nPreviously, we have investigated this anomalous metal-insulator transition by constructing the effective low energy model for CeOs4 Sb12 . We employed the semi-metallic band\nstructure motivated by the LDA band structure calculation7 and discussed magnetic properties. When the enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility appears with an increase\nof the external field, the phase boundary between the metallic state and the antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) state shifts to the high temperature region. Thus, the phase diagram\nobserved in CeOs4 Sb12 can be qualitatively reproduced.\nAlthough magnetic properties under the external field have been investigated for the\n2\n\n\fKondo insulator,8,9,10 we discuss not only the insulating systems but the semi-metallic systems in the present study, and investigate the generalized condition of the appearance of\nthe anomalous phase boundary in detail. A part of Sec. II of the present results has already\nbeen reported in the letter.11\nThis paper is organized as follows. We construct the effective model with tight-binding\nband of CeOs4 Sb12 and discuss magnetic properties under the external field in the next\nsection. In Sec. III, We introduce the two parabolic band model in order to consider the\nmagnetic response in detail and discuss the general conditions to realize the anomalous phase\ntransitions. Summary and discussions are given in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE MODEL FOR CEOS4 SB12\n\nIn this section, we investigate magnetic properties of a filled-skutterudite compound\nCeOs4 Sb12 . It is because this material may have the semi-metallic band structure and\nbecomes a typical low-carrier system with the anomalous phase boundary.\nThe temperature-field (T \u2212 B) phase boundary of the filled skutterudite CeOs4 Sb12 shifts\nto the higher temperature region with an increase of the external magnetic field.5,6 Although\nsuch an anomalous phase boundary has been observed in quadrupole ordered states12 , the\nmagnetic susceptibility measurement13 suggests the crystalline field ground state is \u03937 , which\nhas no quadratic moment. Note that although the Sb12 cluster has a Th symmetry, J = 5/2\nf 1 state of the Ce atom in the Sb12 cluster feels only the Oh part of the crystal field. Some\nexperiments suggest that SDW transition is realized in this material at TN = 0.8 K, below\nwhich the material changes from a metal to an insulator.6\nFor the filled-skutterudite compounds, rare earth ions placed in the center of the Sb12\nclusters form body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure, where the f orbitals on the rareearth ions strongly hybridize the p orbitals on X12 clusters. These p orbitals form wide\nconduction bands. We employ the periodic Anderson model consisted of the dispersive f\nband and the topmost of the conduction bands. The Hamiltonian is as follows:\nH =\n\nX\n\n\u01ebck c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 +\n\nk\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\u01ebfk fk\u03c3\nfk\u03c3\n\nk\u03c3\n\nX\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nVk c\u2020k\u03c3 fk\u03c3 + h.c + U\n\nk\u03c3\n\n3\n\nX\n\nnfi\u2191 nfi\u2193\n\n\f0\nEk\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.1\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\nN P\n\nH\n\nP N\n\nH\n\nFIG. 1: Non-interacting band structure at low energy region in the absence of the external field,\nwhere \u03b1c = 1.0, \u03b1f = 0.03, \u03b12 = 0.07, and Ef = 0.3, and V = 0.15. Fermi level lies at \u03c9 = 0. The\ninset shows the low-energy band structure.\n\n+ Bext\n\nX \u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c3 nck\u03c3 + \u03b2nfk\u03c3 ,\n\nk\u03c3\n\nwhere\n\nc\u2020k\u03c3\n\n\u2020\n(fk\u03c3\n)\n\n(1)\n\nand ck\u03c3 (fk\u03c3 ) are creation and annihilation operators of a conduction (f )\n\nelectron with the pseudo-spin \u03c3 (expressing \u03937 doublet) and momentum k. \u01ebck (\u01ebfk ) represents\nthe band dispersion of conduction (f ) electrons. For the filled-skutterudite compounds, we\ntake the BCC tight-binding bands with the nearest and the next-nearest hoppings, \u01ebck = \u03b1c tk\nand \u01ebfk = \u03b1f tk +Ef , where tk = cos(kx /2) cos(ky /2) cos(kz /2)+\u03b12(cos(kx )+cos(ky )+cos(kz )).\nVk is the hybridization between f and conduction electrons. Although the hybridization\ngenerally has the momentum dependence, we neglect this k dependence (Vk = V ), for\n\u2020\nsimplicity. nck,\u03c3 (nfk,\u03c3 ) represents a number operator (nck,\u03c3 = c\u2020k,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3 , nfk,\u03c3 = fk,\u03c3\nfk,\u03c3 ). U is\n\nthe Coulomb repulsion between f electrons. The last term of the Hamiltonian represents\nthe Zeeman effect and Bext is the applied magnetic field along z direction. \u03b2 is the effective\nmagnetic moment, which is 5/7 (=gJ hJz i=5/6 \u00d7 6/7) for Ce. In this section, \u03b1c is taken to\nbe unity, for simplicity, so that the values of other parameters and quantities will be given\nrelative to \u03b1c .\nIn the non-interacting case, Hamiltonian Eq. (1) is easily diagonalized, whose eigenvalues\nare given by\nEk\u00b1\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01ebck\n\n+\n\n\u01ebfk\n\n\u00b1\n\nq\n\n(\u01ebck\n\n\u2212\n\n\u01ebfk )2\n\n+ 4V\n\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n/2.\n\n(2)\n\nTaking account of the trend of the lattice constants of Ce-based skutterudite compounds and\n4\n\n\fenergy gaps, CeOs4 Sb12 should belong to the semi-metallic group.6 Figure 1 shows the noninteracting band dispersion in the absence of external magnetic field at low-energy regime.\nAlthough we employ the simple model, the obtained band structure captures the essential\nfeatures in comparison with the result of the LDA calculation7 at low energy region, where\nthe lower band at \u0393 point and the upper band at H point slightly intersect the Fermi level.\nOur obtained band dispersions also show the semi-metallic character.\nIn general, the Coulomb repulsion between f electrons is screened in the rare-earth metals.\nFurthermore, the effects of the Hubbard-type interaction may be suppressed by the external\nfield. Therefore, in order to investigate the Hamiltonian Eq. (1), we employ the random\nphase approximation (RPA), which is one of the mean-field approximations and is justified\nin the weak coupling regime. Then, magnetic susceptibilities for x and z directions are given\nby\n\u03c7\u00b1 (q) = \u03c7y (q) =\n\u03c7z (q) =\n\n\u03b2 2 \u03c70\u2191\u2193 (q)\n,\n2 1 \u2212 U\u03c70\u2191\u2193 (q)\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b2 2 \u03c70\u2191\u2191 (q) + \u03c70\u2193\u2193 (q) + 2U\u03c70\u2191\u2191 (q)\u03c70\u2193\u2193 (q)\n,\n4\n1 \u2212 U 2 \u03c70\u2191\u2191 (q)\u03c70\u2193\u2193 (q)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c70\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 is the band susceptibility and is defined as\n\u03c70\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (q) =\n\n\u2212T X f\ng (k + q, i\u03c9n )g\u03c3f \u2032 (k, i\u03c9n ),\nN k,\u03c9n \u03c3\n1\n\ng\u03c3f (k, i\u03c9n ) =\ni\u03c9n + \u03bc \u2212\n\n\u01ebfk\u03c3\n\nV2\n\u2212\ni\u03c9n + \u03bc \u2212 \u01ebck\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01ebck\u03c3 = \u01ebck + \u03c3Bext and \u01ebfk\u03c3 = \u01ebfk + \u03c3\u03b2Bext .\nNote that the band susceptibility \u03c7(q) consists of 4 \u00d7 4 matrix for each momentum q in\nthis treatment in an exact formulation. Since f electrons are strongly localized in comparison\nwith conduction electrons, the f -f component of the band susceptibility is dominant for the\neffect of the external field. Furthermore, since only the f electrons have the strong Coulomb\nrepulsion, the magnetic instability mainly results from f electrons. Hereafter, we consider\nonly the f -diagonal component, for simplicity.\nFigure 2 shows the momentum dependence of the band susceptibility. The maximum\npeak appears at q =\n\n2\u03c0\n(1, 0, 0).\na\n\nLet us discuss the instability for the ordered state. In the\n\nabsence of the external field, the band susceptibility \u03c70\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 is independent of the spin index.\nConsidering Eqs. (3) and (4) within RPA, the maximum peak at H point indicates that\n5\n\n\fBand susceptibility\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\u0393\n\nN P\n\n\u0393\n\nH\n\nP N\n\nH\n\nFIG. 2: Static band susceptibility for various momenta in the absence of the external field at\nT = 0.004.\n\nthe ordering vector is Q =\n\n2\u03c0\n(1, 0, 0),\na\n\nat which \u03c7\u00b1 (Q) and \u03c7z (Q) are strongly enhanced\n\nwith an increase of the Coulomb interaction. This behavior can be explained by the nesting\nproperty. Since the Fermi surfaces become small spheres at the top of the lower band (\u0393\npoint) and at the bottom of the upper band (H point), the particle-hole excitations can\neasily occur between these momenta, which can be easily understood in Fig. 1. The recent\nneutron scattering experiment for CeOs4 Sb12 shows that the ordering vector in the absence\nof the external field corresponds to\n\n2\u03c0\n(1, 0, 0).14\na\n\nTherefore, although the LDA results have a\n\nconduction band with a concave dispersion near \u0393 point in addition to the band we assumed,\nit may not affect magnetic properties of CeOs4 Sb12 .\nNext, we investigate the magnetic response under the external field. Figure 3 shows\nthe largest susceptibilities for the parallel component (\u03c7z ) and perpendicular component\n(\u03c7\u00b1 ) to the external field. For the perpendicular component (\u03c7\u00b1 ), the maximum occurs at\nQ=\n\n2\u03c0\n(1, 0, 0),\na\n\nwhich does not change as far as Bext < 0.2. On the other hand, the peak\n\nposition of the parallel component gradually changes with an increase of the external field.\nThe largest value of \u03c7\u00b1 is enhanced within small Bext range because the external field may\nchange the number of the states close to the Fermi level, which is discussed in Sec. III in\ndetail. This result indicates that the instability for the magnetic order is enhanced by the\nexternal field. The transition temperature TN of the metal-AFI transition is determined by\n1 \u2212 U\u03c70\u2191\u2193 (TN ) = 0 within RPA. Because of the enhancement of \u03c7\u00b1 , the phase boundary of\nthe metal-AFI transition shifts to the higher temperature region with an increase of Bext ,\nwhich is shown in Fig. 4.\n6\n\n\fLargest Susceptibilities\n\n1.4\n\n\u03c7 \u00b1 (q)\n\u03c7 z (q)\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nBext\n\nFIG. 3: Largest magnetic susceptibilities as a function of the external field at T = 0.003 where\nU = 0.

The\ninset shows the experimental result.6\n\nNote that except for Bext = 0, the direction of the magnetic moments are perpendicular\nto the external field in the ordered state in the present study. In the very weak field region,\nthe shift of the phase boundary is independent of the external field. Namely, the slope\nof the phase boundary as a function of temperature becomes infinite, which results from\nthe symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to the reversal of the direction of the field.\nHowever, since magnetic anisotropies exist in the realistic materials due to the coupling to\nthe lattice, the magnetic moment may not suddenly be directed to x or y axis, but only be\nslightly canted from z direction.\nFurther increasing the external field, the phase boundary is closed. The obtained anoma-\n\n7\n\n\flous T \u2212B phase diagram can quantitatively reproduce the experimental result of CeOs4 Sb12 ,\nwhich indicates that the effective model in this section may describe qualitative properties\nof this material.\n\nIII.\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS FOR ANOMALOUS PHASE DIAGRAM\n\nIn the previous section, we have obtained anomalous T \u2212B phase diagram by constructing\nthe effective model of CeOs4 Sb12 , where the enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility\n\u03c7\u00b1 with an increase of the external field was essential. In this section, we investigate in\ndetail the general condition to realize the anomalous phase diagram in the two-band system\nwith low carriers, such as the semi-metallic system shown in Fig. 1. For this purpose, we\nintroduce a simplified model Hamiltonian. Since the external field dependence of the band\nsusceptibility is directly related to the AFI-metal phase boundary within RPA, which was\ndiscussed in Sec. II, hereafter we focus on the band susceptibility.\nThe energy dispersions of the semi-metallic system close to the Fermi level are the almost\nparabolic structure with respect to momenta k with low carriers (Fig. 1 inset). Therefore,\nwe approximate the effective band dispersion close to the Fermi level by the two parabolic\nbands. Then the Hamiltonian for the band dispersions is given as\nH\u0303 =\n\nX\n\n\u01eb\u03b1k\u03c3 a\u2020k\u03b1\u03c3 ak\u03b1\u03c3 ,\n\n(7)\n\nk\u03b1\u03c3\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n\u2212{k2 \u2212 \u22062 } + \u03c3Bext (\u03b1 = 1)\n\u01eb\u03b1k\u03c3 = \uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b3{(k \u2212 Q)2 \u2212 \u2206 } + \u03c3Bext (\u03b1 = 2),\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere a\u2020k\u03b1\u03c3 (ak\u03b1\u03c3 ) is creation (annihilation) operator of an electron with the pseudo-spin \u03c3,\nmomentum k, and band index \u03b1(= 1, 2). We assume 2m = 1 for simplicity, and \u03b3 stands\nfor the curvature of the band 2 relative to that of the band 1 and the bottom of the band 2\nis located at k = Q. \u2206 stands for the overlap (\u2206 > 0) or gap (\u2206 < 0) between two bands.\nFigure 5(a) shows the schematic band dispersions of Eq.

The schematic behavior for the\nexternal field is shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). Note that the amplitude of the band diagonal\nsusceptibility (Eq. (12)) is small in comparison with that of the band off-diagonal component\nunder the weak external field.\n\n9\n\n\fA.\n\nAbsolute Zero Temperature\n\nAt absolute zero temperature (T = 0), we can analytically calculate Eqs. (9)-(12). The\nsemi-metallic state (\u2206 > 0) has small hole (band 1) and electron (band 2) Fermi surfaces.\nIn the absence of the external field, the volume of the Fermi surface of the band 1 is equal\n1\n2\nto that of the band 2. The radius of each Fermi surface is kF\u03c3\n= kF\u03c3\n=\n\nq\n\n\u2206\n2\n\n(\u2206 > 0), where\n\n\u03b1\nkF\u03c3\nis Fermi wave vector of band \u03b1 with the pseudo spin \u03c3. Therefore, the perfect nesting\n\nof the Fermi surfaces is realized, so that the band susceptibility always diverges at q = Q\nregardless of any spatial dimensions, where Q becomes the ordering vector. If the orbital\ndegeneracy remains, the perfect nesting condition may vanish even in the absence of the\nexternal field. The effect of the orbital degeneracy will be discussed in later section.\nThe radius of each Fermi sphere is gradually modified as the external field is applied.\nWhen both bands intersect the Fermi level which satisfies the following relations \u2206/2 +\n\u03c3Bext > 0 and \u2206/2 \u2212 \u03c3Bext /\u03b3 > 0, both Fermi wave vectors at small Bext are given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 k1\n\nF\u03c3\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n=\n\n2\nkF\u03c3\n=\n\nq\n\nq\n\n\u2206\n2\n\n+ \u03c3Bext\n\n\u2206\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3Bext\n.\n\u03b3\n\n(13)\n\nIf a larger external field is applied, band 1 with pseudospin \u2193 and band 2 with pseudospin\n\u2191 can not intersect the Fermi level, where the Fermi surfaces of band 1 with pseudospin \u2193\nand of band 2 with pseudospin \u2191 are lost.\nIf the curvature of the band 2 is equal to that of the band 1 (\u03b3 = 1), the volume of Fermi\nsphere of the band 1 with spin \u03c3 is always equal to that of the band 2 with spin \u03c3\u0304 even in\nthe presence of the external field, where the perfect nesting still remains between different\nbands. Therefore, when the infinitesimal Coulomb interaction is introduced, the magnetic\nsusceptibility always diverges regardless of the presence of the external field within RPA.\nSince the perfect nesting vanishes for \u03b3 6= 1 and Bext 6= 0, the band susceptibility remains\nfinite, so that magnetic instabilities are suppressed in comparison with the case of \u03b3 = 1.\nOn the other hand, if \u2206 < 0 where the band insulator with gap |\u2206| is realized, the\namplitude of the band susceptibility becomes small. When the gap vanishes by applying the\nexternal field, the band susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 (Q) diverges (\u03b3 = 1) and becomes enhanced to a\nlarge value (\u03b3 6= 1).\nHowever, our interest is the origin of the anomalous behavior of temperature-field phase\ndiagram. In next subsection, we discuss the magnetic response to the external field at finite\n10\n\n\ftemperature.\n\nB.\n\nLow Temperature Susceptibility\n\nMagnetic order cannot occur at finite temperature except for the three-dimensional case.\nHowever, in order to clarify the origin of the anomalous phase boundary, the magnetic\nsusceptibilities for various dimensions are investigated in detail within the mean-field level\nin the very low-temperature region (T = 0.01) in this subsection.\nSince, unfortunately, it is not easy to carry out the analytical calculations of the band\nsusceptibility at finite temperature, we numerically evaluate Eqs. (9)-(12). Note that since\nwe employ the parabolic band in energy dispersions, the bandwidth becomes infinite. In\norder to maintain the finite bandwidth, we restrict the wave-vectors within |kx | + |ky | < \u03c0,\n|ky | + |kz | < \u03c0, and |kz | + |kx | < \u03c0 in numerical calculations. However, this restriction is\nirrelevant for magnetic properties at low temperature and weak external field.\nThe density of states (DOS) reproduces \u03c1(\u03c9) \u223c |\u03c9|d/2\u22121 at \u03c9 \u223c 0 for d dimensions at\n\u2206 = Bext = 0, which is the well-known result. Because of the restriction of the wave-vectors,\nDOS rapidly decreases at sufficiently large |\u03c9| (> 5) region even in two and three dimensions.\nFirst, let us compare the amplitude of the perpendicular susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 (q) with that\nof the parallel susceptibility \u03c7\u0303z0 (q) under the magnetic field for various spatial dimensions\nat \u03b3 = 1. Figure 6 shows the largest values of the band susceptibilities at T = 0.01 in\nthe semi-metallic case for various dimensions. The perpendicular components of the band\nsusceptibilities become always larger than those of the parallel components in whole range\nof the external field and all dimensions. The largest values of the perpendicular components\nfor all dimensions appear at q = Q, which corresponds to the nesting vector, while the\nordering wave vectors of the parallel components are gradually shifted as the external field\nincreases. For the insulating case (\u2206 < 0), the perpendicular susceptibilities are always\nlarger than the parallel susceptibilities.\nSince these behaviors are similar to the results of Sec. II, qualitative properties of the\nanomalous phase-diagram obtained in Sec. II may be captured even in this simplified model.\nThe obtained result indicates that the magnetic instability perpendicular to the external field\noccurs in this system. Therefore, we hereafter focus on the behavior of the perpendicular\nsusceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 (q).\n11\n\n\fLargest susceptibility Largest susceptibility\n\n20\n(a) 1D\nperpendicular\nparallel\n\n10\n\n0\nperpendicular (b) 2D\nparallel\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n\nLargest susceptibility\n\n0\n8\n\nperpendicular\nparallel\n\n(c) 3D\n\n2\n\n8\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\nBext\n\nFIG. 6: Largest values of perpendicular and parallel components of band susceptibilities as a\nfunction of external field for (a) one dimension, (b) two dimensions, and (c) three dimensions at\nT = 0.01, \u2206 = 1, and \u03b3 = 1. The solid (dotted) lines stand for perpendicular (parallel) components.\nThe wave vectors in all perpendicular components are q = Q.\n\nAlthough the perpendicular susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 (q) consists of the band diagonal and the offdiagonal parts, the amplitude of the latter is greater than that of the former. Thus, magnetic\nproperties are almost determined by the off-diagonal part, which consists of two components,\n12\n\u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 and \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 terms. The schematic behavior of the band off-diagonal susceptibilities is shown\n\nin Fig. 5(b) and (c), where there are contributions from the band dispersions shifting away\nfrom the Fermi level and approaching the Fermi level with an increase of the external field.\nAlthough the perfect nesting still exists at \u03b3 = 1 even under the external field, the amplitude\n12\n\n\fLargest susceptibility Largest susceptibility\n\ntotal\nFig .5(b)\nFig .5(c)\n\n20 (a) 1D\n\n10\n\n0\n10\n5\n\n(b) 2D\n\ntotal\nFig .5(b)\nFig .5(c)\n\nLargest susceptibility\n\n0\n6\n\n(c) 3D\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\ntotal\nFig .5(b)\nFig .5(c)\n0.2 0.4 0.6\nBext\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 7: Largest values of perpendicular susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 and band off-diagonal components as a\nfunction of external field at \u2206 = 1, T = 0.01, and \u03b3 = 1 at low field region.

All wave\n\nvectors are q = Q.\n\nof the band susceptibility becomes finite due to the finite temperature effect even at q = Q.\nIn order to understand properties of the perpendicular susceptibilities, we show two offdiagonal components of the perpendicular susceptibilities in Fig. 7 for the semi-metallic\n12\ncase (\u2206 = 1). For one-dimensional system, \u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 (Fig. 5(b)) decreases while \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 (Fig. 5(c))\n\nincreases as the small external field is applied. For two-dimensional system, \u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 is almost\nindependent of the external field, while \u03c7\u030312\n\u2193\u2191 (Fig. 5(c)) is strongly suppressed at Bext > \u2206/2.\n12\nOn the other hand, \u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 increases while \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 decreases in three dimensions as the external field\n\n13\n\n\fis applied. In addition to these behaviors, the conspicuous changes appear at Bext \u223c \u2206/2 for\nall dimensional cases. This result indicates that the number of the states close to the Fermi\nlevel is directly related to the amplitude of susceptibility. With an increase of the external\nfield, the number of the states close to the Fermi level for the cases Fig. 5(b) and (c) is\nmodified. Thus, the weight of particle-hole excitations at low temperature also drastically\n12\nchanged by the external field, which affects the amplitude of \u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 and that of \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 .\n\nFor one-dimensional system, DOS \u03c1\u03b1 (\u03c9) with band index \u03b1 has a maximum peak on each\nband edge (\u03c9 = \u00b1\u2206/2). Therefore, when the overlap between two bands for \u03c7\u030312\n\u2193\u2191 (Fig. 5(c))\n12\ndisappears for by applying Bext \u223c \u2206/2, the amplitude of \u03c7\u030312\n\u2193\u2191 becomes maximum. For \u03c7\u0303\u2191\u2193\n\n(Fig. 5(b)), the change of the number of the states becomes small in comparison with that\n12\n12\nof Fig. 5(c). The total susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 is mainly determined by the sum of \u03c7\u0303\u2191\u2193 and \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 ,\n\nso that a enhancement of \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 for the external field appears.\nFor larger dimensions, the DOS is related to the structure of the perpendicular susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 . In the two-dimensional system, since DOS is independent of frequency \u03c9,\n12\n\u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 almost becomes constant. However, the overlap between two bands for \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 disappears\n\nat Bext > \u2206/2, so that the amplitude is reduced at Bext > \u2206/2. Therefore the total\nsusceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 is also reduced at Bext > \u2206/2. In the three-dimensional case, DOS for\n1\n\n1\n\neach band is \u03c11\u03c3 (\u03c9) = |\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206/2 \u2212 \u03c3Bext | 2 and \u03c12\u03c3 (\u03c9) = |\u03c9 + \u2206/2 \u2212 \u03c3Bext | 2 . The ratio of\nchange of the number of the states to the external field is approximately represented as\n1\n\n1\n\nd\u03c1(\u03c9)/dBext |\u03c9=0 \u223c |\u2206/2 + Bext |\u2212 2 for Fig. 5(b) and |\u2206/2 \u2212 Bext |\u2212 2 for Fig. 5(c) at sufficiently low temperature, so that the decrease of the number of the states for \u03c7\u030312\n\u2193\u2191 becomes\nslightly larger than the increase of the number of the states for \u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 in the small external\nfield region. Thus, the total perpendicular susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 is reduced at Bext < \u2206/2 while\nit is enhanced with further increase of Bext (> \u2206/2).\nAlthough the maximum of the band susceptibilities appears at the nesting vector at finite\ntemperature, the amplitude strongly depends on the structure of DOS close to Fermi level.\nIn the present study, our main objective is to explore the possibility of the anomalous phase\ntransition for three-dimensional realistic systems. Hereafter, we discuss magnetic properties\nmore in detail in three dimensions.\nIn Fig. 8, we show the perpendicular components of the band susceptibilities for various\n\u2206 in the three-dimensional system. The cusps appear around at Bext \u223c 5, which arise from\nthe band edge due to the introductions of the cutoff wave vectors.

The inset shows the low-field part.\n\nare absent, the amplitude gradually increases for the three-dimensional system in the present\nmodel.\nHowever, our aim is to clarify magnetic properties in the low field region. The difference\nin each perpendicular susceptibility particularly appears at Bext < |\u2206|/2. For the \u2206 < 0\ncase, which corresponds to a insulating state with a gap |\u2206|, the enhancements of the\nsusceptibilities for the external field can be realized at Bext > |\u2206|/2. When Bext = 0, there\nis no states close to the Fermi level at low temperature due to the existence of the insulating\ngap. When the gap in DOS vanishes due to the introduction of the external field (Bext \u223c\n12\n|\u2206|/2), \u03c7\u030312\n\u2191\u2193 is strongly enhanced. Since there is no states close to the Fermi level for \u03c7\u0303\u2193\u2191 in the\n\nwhole field region, the amplitude becomes almost constant at low temperature. Therefore,\nas far as the insulating state (\u2206 < 0) with a sufficiently small gap, the enhancement of the\nmagnetic susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 can be realized in the low field region. On the other hand, for\n\u2206 > 0, each band intersects the Fermi level and the semi-metallic state is realized, where\nthe overlap amplitude between two bands is \u2206 at Bext = 0. As the explanation for \u2206 > 0\nis given in Fig. 7, the perpendicular susceptibility \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 for the external field is suppressed\nwithin Bext < \u2206/2.\nNote here that the suppression of the perpendicular susceptibility in the three-dimensional\n15\n\n\fLargest value of \u03c7\n\n8\n\n(a) \u2206=-1\nT=0.01\nT=0.05\n6\nT=0.10\nT=0.20\nT=0.50\n4\n2\n(b) \u2206=1\nT=0.01\nT=0.05\nT=0.10\nT=0.20\n6\nT=0.50\n\nLargest value of \u03c7\n\n8\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nT\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 9: Largest values of perpendicular susceptibilities \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 as a function of external field for various\ntemperature at \u03b3 = 1 at (a) \u2206 = \u22121 (insulator) and (b) \u2206 = 1 (semi metal) for three-dimensional\nsystem.

Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of the\nperpendicular susceptibilities. For the insulating state, the enhancements of the perpendicular susceptibilities for the external field appear in all temperature regions at Bext > |\u2206|/2.\nOn the other hand, in the semi-metallic state, the perpendicular susceptibility is sensitive\nto temperature.

All wave vectors are\nq = Q.\n\ntibility for the external field is clearly shown at Bext < \u2206/2. However, the suppressions of\nthe perpendicular susceptibilities are weakened with an increase of the temperature. The\namplitude is almost independent of Bext (< \u2206/2) at T \u223c 0.1. At T > 0.1 the enhancement\nappears in overall range of the external field. The magnetic instability is determined by\n1 \u2212 U \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n0 \u2192 0 within RPA as discussed in the previous section. If the magnetic order caused\nby the Coulomb interaction is realized at the higher temperature range which exhibits the\nenhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility for the external field, the anomalous T \u2212 B\nphase diagram whose phase boundary monotonically shifts to the higher temperature region\nis obtained.\nThe effect of the curvature \u03b3 of parabolic dispersions is shown in Fig. 10. For all \u03b3, the\nenhancements appear at the low field region. However, the amplitude of the enhancement\nis the most conspicuous at \u03b3 = 1 where the nesting condition survives under the presence\nof the external field. Therefore, as the curvature of one band becomes close to that of the\nother, it is favorable to realize the enhancement of the susceptibility for the external field.\nFinally, let us consider the structure of the phase boundary by taking account of the structures of the perpendicular susceptibilities. Figure 11 shows the possible phase boundaries\nwithin RPA. In the insulating state (\u2206 < 0), the monotonic enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility appears within low field region at the wide temperature region. Then,\n17\n\n\f(b)\n\nBext\n\nBext\n\n(a)\n\nT\n\nT\n\nFIG. 11: Possible phase boundaries; (a) \u2206 < 0 (insulator) or \u2206 > 0 (semimetal) and higher\ntemperature region, (b) \u2206 > 0 (semimetal) and very low temperature region (T \u226a \u2206).\n\nobtained phase boundary always shifts to the high temperature region with an increase of\nthe external field (Fig. 11(a)). For the semi-metallic case (\u2206 > 0) in the higher temperature\nregion, the structure of the perpendicular susceptibility is similar to the insulating case, so\nthat the phase boundary shows also monotonic shift to the higher temperature region for\nthe external field. Thus the phase boundary also becomes the structure of Fig. 11(a).\nOn the other hand, for the semi-metallic case (\u2206 > 0) in very low temperature region,\nthe perpendicular susceptibility becomes the concave structure within the low field region.\nThus, when the magnetic order is realized in this temperature region, the phase boundary\nmay become nontrivial structure (Fig. 11(b)).\nTo summarize the parabolic band model at finite temperatures, the enhancement of the\nperpendicular susceptibilities by the external field can appear in the insulating states with\na small gap. On the other hand, for the semi-metallic states when the overlap between\ntwo bands is sufficiently small, the enhancement may appear except for very low temperature region (T \u226a \u2206). In very low temperature region, the perpendicular susceptibility for\nthe external field becomes concave structure, so that the phase-boundary may become the\nnontrivial structure.\nIn order to realize anomalous phase diagrams in the realistic semi-metallic/insulating\nmaterials, following conditions are required: (1) both the overlap and gap between two\nbands are sufficiently small; (2) the Fermi surfaces for electrons and holes in the semimetallic state are very small spheres. (3) the change of the density of states close to the\nFermi level caused by Bext becomes conspicuous; (4) the curvature of one band dispersion\nis close to that of the other.\n18\n\n\fIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the conditions for the appearance of the anomalous temperature vs.\nexternal field phase diagram in low-carrier two-band systems with a narrow gap or a smalloverlap (semi-metal). Employing the periodic Anderson model and the parabolic dispersion\nmodel close to the Fermi level, the magnetic susceptibilities are calculated by using RPA\nand magnetic properties are discussed under the external field.\nFor the filled-skutterudite compound CeOs4 Sb12 whose energy dispersions may have the\nsemi-metallic band structure, we construct the effective model by employing the periodic\nAnderson model with the dispersive f band, which reproduces the main features of the LDA\nresult close to the Fermi level. Considering magnetic properties, we show that the enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility for the external field is related to the anomalous\nphase diagram observed in experimental results.\nWe further introduce the two-band model with the parabolic dispersion in order to clarify\nthe origin of the anomalous phase boundary. The structure of the perpendicular susceptibility for the external field is discussed in detail. When a small insulating gap exists in the\nband structure in the absence of the external field, the magnetic susceptibility perpendicular\nto the external field is enhanced by the small field, which results from the disappearance of\nthe insulating gap due to the external field. On the other hand, in the semi-metallic case,\nthe realization of anomalous phase diagrams strongly depends on the structure of density of\nstates close to the Fermi level and the temperature region.\nWe consider the effects of Coulomb interaction only by using RPA. This method is one\nof the mean-field approximations and neglects the effect of quantum fluctuations which\nmay be particularly important in the vicinity of the quantum critical points.15 Therefore,\nif quantum fluctuations are taken into account by employing more accurate methods, such\nas the fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approximation, the phase boundary may quantitatively\nshift to the low temperature region.\nLet us consider the effect of the orbital degeneracy. Heavy fermion compounds have the\ndegeneracy of f orbitals of rare earth and actinide ions. We consider the simplest model\nwith a lower band and an upper band, where the effect of degeneracy of each band is\nnot considered. If one is single band and the others have degeneracy, the perfect nesting\ncondition is absent even at zero field. However, in the present study, we consider low-carrier\n19\n\n\ftwo-band models with a small overlap and a gap between two bands, where the electron\nand hole surfaces become very small spheres. Therefore, when the Fermi spheres become\nobscure at finite temperature region, the nesting vector does not change even if the orbital\ndegeneracy is considered. The structure of DOS close to Fermi level becomes most essential\nto the anomalous phase diagram. When the hole doping is also introduced, the nesting\ncondition becomes worse. However, as far as the concentration does not conspicuously\naffect the number of the states near the Fermi level, the doping effect is irrelevant at finite\ntemperature region in this study. Thus, we conclude that the orbital degeneracy does not\nchange the result presented here.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank M. Kohgi, K. Iwasa, H. Harima, H.
