For example in risk management applications, they directly affect the calculation\nof the value at risk or the expected shortfall. In the context of capital allocation, the correlation structure is key\nin the classical portfolio optimization problem, as shown\nin the seminal work of Markowitz (1952).\nGenerally, the quality of the estimated matrices increases with the length of the time series, i.e., the amount\nof data used. For small datasets the matrices have a large\nvariance and may even be singular or indefinite. In financial context, however, using long time series results\nin biased estimates of the correlation structure, since the\ndependence of asset returns is not constant in time (see,\ne.g., King and Wadhwani (1990) for an early review).\nThe problem is that standard estimators equally\nweight all parts of the dataset. By consequence, outof-date and improper information highly affect the estimates. This paper tackles this problem by introducing a\nnew weighted estimator of the correlation or covariance\nmatrix. This estimator makes use of enough data to adequately limit its variance but - in order to minimize its\nbias - focuses only on parts of the data where the market\nis in similar market conditions, i.e., it exhibits the same\ncorrelation structure.\nTo reduce the effects of time changing structures, common approaches in the literature choose time intervals\nwhere the structures are approximately constant. Examples of such approaches are exponentially weighted esti-\n\na) Electronic\n\nmail: michael@muennix.com\n\nmators like the RiskMetrics estimators (see, e.g., Longerstaey and Spencer (1996)) or the estimators discussed in\nLee and Stevenson (2003). Since these estimators only\nuse a small part of the data, they show a large variance.\nMoreover, whenever the number of effectively used observations is not large compared to the dimensions of the\ntime series, estimated correlation and covariance matrices may be regarded as completely random. Laloux et al.\n(1999) showed in an empirical example that in such cases\n94% of the spectrum of estimated correlation matrices\nequal the spectrum of random matrices and only their\nlargest eigenvalues may be estimated adequately.\nSolutions to this problem involve reducing the dimensionality of the problems by imposing some structure on\nthe correlations, e.g., by using factor models or shrinkage estimators as in Ledoit and Wolf (2004) or by noise\nreduction techniques, e.g., Random Matrix Filtering (see\nPlerou et al. (2002)) or Power Mapping (Sch\u00e4fer et al.\n(2009)). Other approaches reduce the dimensionality by\nusing conditional models of the correlation matrices going\nback to the work of Bollerslev (1986). A short overview\nof these practices may be found in Andersen et al. (2007).\nWith the availability of intraday high frequency financial data, it was expected that finer sampled data would\neffectively enlarge the datasets and improve estimates of\nparameters. However, when return data is observed on\nshorter time intervals, it is contaminated by market microstructure effects. These effects influence estimators\nand induce bias and noise (see, e.g., for a recent discussion Bandi et al. (2008)). Possible reasons include asynchrony and decimalization effects (see, e.g., M\u00fcnnix et al.\n(2010a,b)).\nSince the amount of data for the estimation may only\nbe increased by either considering a longer time period or\nby sampling on higher frequencies, the mentioned properties of financial time series limit the amount of usable\ndata. Longer time intervals bias the estimators due to the\n\n\f2\ntime changing nature of the matrices. Higher frequencies\nintensify the effects of the market microstructure on the\nestimators.\nIn this paper, we circumvent these limits. We propose to enlarge the amount of usable data by adaptively\nincluding different parts of the time series with similar\ncorrelation structures into the estimator. We therefore\nintroduce a similarity measure which measures the degree of similarity between days of the time series based on\nprobe correlation estimations. We demonstrate the application of the measure on assessing similarities on stock\nreturns from the S&P 500 index. The measure reliably\ndetects regime changes in the data as well as the special\nmarket situation during the financial crisis in 2008.\nThe similarity measure enables us to construct a\nweighting scheme for correlation or covariance estimators that attaches high weights on similar parts of the\ndata and suppresses distortions. In a simulation study,\nwe demonstrate that these similarity weighted estimators\nshow smaller bias and variance than unweighted or exponentially weighted estimators. The results hold for constant as well as for dynamic correlation structures in the\ndata. In a real data application we apply our estimator\nto covariance estimation in the context of mean-variance\nportfolio optimization. We use time-series of stocks from\nthe S&P 500 index and randomly choose stocks to build\nup portfolios. We show that optimal portfolios which\nare based on the similarity weighted covariance estimator\noutperform alternative approaches with respect to realized volatility and realized return.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the measure of similarity. In section III, a similarity based weighting scheme for estimators of correlation or covariance is constructed. Section IV contains a\nsimulation study analyzing variance and bias of the resulting estimators. In section V we empirically apply\nthe estimators in the context of mean-variance portfolio\noptimization. Section VI concludes.\nII.\n\nMEASURING MARKET SIMILARITY\n\nWe measure the degree of similarity \u03b6 in the market's\ncorrelation structure by the norm of the difference of the\ncorrelation matrices C(t1 ) and C(t2 ) of the times t1 and\nt2 , i.e.,\n\u03b6(t1 , t2 ) = C(t1 ) \u2212 C(t2 )\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ||C||2 represents the induced matrix 2-norm of the\nreal valued matrix C, which is the square root of largest\neigenvalue of the matrix C0 C.\nThe correlation matrices C(t1 ) and C(t2 ) are estimated on a backward-looking rolling window of length\nL. The window length L will be indicated by a superscript, i.e., \u03b6 L . If outliers are present in the data, the estimates are based on Spearman's rank correlation instead\nof Pearson's product moment correlation as this estimator is more robust to non-normal distributions.

Illustration of of the \u03b6 50 similarity measure for the\ncorrelation structure of the S&P 500 index from 2005 to the\nbeginning of 2010. Each point of the graphic reflects the degree of similarity between the days at its coordinates. The\ndark shaded areas indicate a correlation structure that is not\nsimilar to any other period before or after, while the white\nareas indicate high values of similarity. The region past Oct\n2008 can clearly be identified as the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. Furthermore, in Feb 2007 the correlation\nstructure of the assets changes.\n\nthe estimates should be unbiased for time varying correlations, the use of small window lengths is recommended.\nAs discussed in Laloux et al. (1999), this results in noisy\nestimates of the matrices and only the largest eigenvalues of the matrices are adequately estimated. However,\nthe similarity measure (1) is based on the 2-norm and\nthus depends only on this largest eigenvalue, which can\nbe estimated even for small values of L.\nFigure 1 illustrates the evolution of the similarity measure \u03b6 50 for the example of the 471 assets, that were continuously in the S&P 500 index between Aug 2005 and\nJan 2010. The similarity measure is evaluated for every day between Aug 2005 and Jan 2010 and depicted\nas a matrix. The axes represent time, therefore the evolution of the market related to a specific point in time\nis given by the upright (or vertical) intersection through\nthis point. Darker regions on this intersection are less\nsimilar and brighter regions more similar to the situation at the specific point in time. In this illustration,\nthe the financial crisis causes a shaded area from Oct\n2008 to Mar 2009. The correlation structure in this period is completely different from any period before. After\nthis period we find the market stabilizing: The correlation structure becomes similar to previous market states\nagain. Beside the financial crisis, we can find regions for\nany point in which the correlation structure was similar\nand regions where it was different.\nFurthermore, we are able to identify a regime switch\n\n\f3\n0.7\n\nthe timespan [t0 \u2212 L, t0 ], they share identical values with\nthe probe matrix at t = t0 . \u03b6\u0303 L (t, t0 ) is then dominated by\nthe amount of identical values and not by the estimated\nsimilarity. Therefore, the similarity measure is not reliable within this region and is set to the maximum value\nof the other timespans, resulting in a corrected measure\n(\nmax(\u03b6\u0303 L (t < t0 \u2212 L, t0 )) t \u2208 [t0 \u2212 L, t0 ]\n\u2217L\n\u03b6\u0303 (t, t0 ) =\n(3)\n\u03b6\u0303 L (t, t0 )\nt \u2208 [t0 \u2212 T, t0 \u2212 L[ .\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\nrs\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nA normalized weighting scheme for the estimation of the\ncorrelation or covariance matrix C(t0 ) or \u03a3(t0 ) at time\nt = t0 is then\n!\nt0\nX\n\u2217L\n\u2217L\nw(t, t0 , L) = \u03b6\u0303 (t, t0 )/\n\u03b6\u0303 (t, t0 ) , (4)\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n005\n\nt2\nOc\n\nr2\nAp\n\n006\n\nt2\n\nOc\n\n006\n\n007\n\nr2\n\nAp\n\n007\n\nt2\n\nOc\n\n008\n\nr2\nAp\n\n008\n\nt2\n\nOc\n\n009\n\nr2\n\nAp\n\nt2\nOc\n\n009\n\nFIG. 2.

Between Feb 2007 and Apr 2007 the overall level of correlation increases, indicating the new correlation regime.\nThe sharp transition on Feb 2007 was induced by large\noverall price drop of the stocks in the S&P 500.

The\nrestricted scheme ws is then given by\n\nSIMILARITY WEIGHTED ESTIMATORS\n\nThe similarity measure \u03b6 L may serve as a weighting\nscheme for estimators of correlation or covariance matrices. With respect to the reference point t0 the scheme\ninscribes high weights to periods where the market behaved in a similar manner. On the other hand, the periods in which the market behaved very differently are\nsuppressed. Therefore, consider the adapted similarity\nmeasure\n\n1\n\nt0\nX\n\nws (t, t0 , L) = |w \u2212 w(s) |+ /\n\nt\nX\n\n|w \u2212 w(s) |+\n\n(6)\n\nt=t0 \u2212T\n\nwith |w \u2212 w(s) |+ = max(w(t, t0 , L) \u2212 w(s) , 0).\nThe unbiasedness of the estimators (5) in time series, where the underlying correlation matrix is constant,\nis easily checked. However, due to fluctuations of the\nweights w, their variances are expected to be slightly\nlarger than for a constant non-adaptive weighting scheme\nw = 1/T.

Shown are the theoretical similarity matrices of the\nsecond and third scenario for the first 1000 trading days. In\nthe left figure, the discrete regimes of the second scenario are\nclearly visible. In the right figure the similarity matrix of the\nthird scenario is shown. It shows no sudden changes.\n\ncorrelations of the correlation matrix (\u03c1i,j ) of the 16 asset returns are equal to \u03c1 = 0.7 for i 6= j. In the second\nand third scenarios, the market consists of two equicorrelated branches, the first 8 assets with equicorrelation\nparameter \u03c11 and the second 8 assets with \u03c13 . Assets of\ntwo different branches are equicorrelated with equicorrelation parameter \u03c12 = 0.2. The equicorrelation parameters of the branches change over time, i.e., \u03c11 = \u03c11 (t)\nand \u03c13 = \u03c13 (t).\nIn the second scenario, the market switches deterministically in turn between three different regimes. Each\nregime lasts 100 trading days. In regime 1, the branches\nare equicorrelated with parameters \u03c11 = 0.7 and \u03c13 =\n0.3. In the second regime, these parameters are both\nequal to 0.5, in the third regime, they are 0.3 and 0.7,\nrespectively.\nIn the third scenario, the parameters \u03c11 (t) and \u03c13 (t)\nchange sinusoidally with the trading days t according to:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\n\u03c11 (t) = 0.4 + 0.3 sin\n2\u03c0\n600\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt \u2212 300\n\u03c12 (t) = 0.4 + 0.3 sin\n2\u03c0 .\n600\nFigure 3 depicts the theoretical similarity matrices of the\nsecond and third scenario for the first 1000 trading days.\nThe discrete regimes of the second scenario are clearly\nvisible while the similarity matrix of the third scenario\nshows no sudden changes.\nThe similarity weighted estimator is compared to\nbenchmark estimators. The first benchmark is the standard Pearson correlation estimator based on the last 300\nreturns. As the second benchmark, we use the RiskMetrics exponentially weighted correlation estimator. The\nestimator weights the j-th recent return with weight wj .\nThe weights are chosen according to\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 X\nn\n1 \u2212 \u03bbn\nwj =\n\u03bbj\u22121 ,\n1\u2212\u03bb\nj=1\nas suggested by Longerstaey and Spencer (1996).\n\nWe estimate the correlation matrix in all three scenarios for the days t = 1000, t = 2500 and t = 5000. To\nestimate mean and variance of the estimators, each simulation is independently repeated 400 times. The results\nare presented in tables I to III which show the means and\nsample standard deviations of the parameters of interest\nover the 400 repetitions for the 3 estimators.\nTable I shows the results of scenario 1. The parameter \u03c1i,j = 0.7 is estimated adequately in all cases, which\nconfirms that all estimators are unbiased in this setup.\nAs to be expected, the standard estimator has the lowest\nvariance. It uses a constant weighting scheme. This is\nknown to be optimal, when the underlying correlation is\nconstant. In this setup, the adaptive weighting scheme\nof the similarity weighted estimator should also equally\nweight all observations. However, due to stochastic fluctuations the weights vary. Therefore, the variance of the\nestimator is slightly larger than the variance of the standard estimator. The exponential weighted scheme suffers\nthe highest variance as it heavily weights the most recent\nobservations. This results in an unbalanced weighting\nscheme which is not optimal in this scenario.\nThe results of scenario 2 are shown in table II. The\nstandard estimator is highly biased since its weighting\nscheme weights data from all 3 regimes equally. Unlike the standard estimator, the exponential estimator\nweights the most recent observations most and therefore\nseems unbiased. Again, its variance is the largest among\nthe three considered estimators. The similarity weighted\nestimator shows variances comparable to the variance of\nthe unweighted estimator but is nearly unbiased. Table\nIII shows the results of scenario 3. Since in this scenario\nthe true parameters change continuously in time, the scenario tests if the adaptive scheme given by the similarity\nmeasure separates the similar regions from the dissimilar\nones in an adequate way. The results are analogue to\nthe results of scenario 2, but for the days 1000 and 2500\nalso the similarity weighted and exponentially weighted\nestimators deviate from the theoretical values. However,\nthey both are much closer to the theoretical value than\nthe unweighted estimator.\nIt is worthwhile to note that in all scenarios the bias\nof the similarity weighted estimator is similar to the bias\nof the exponentially weighted estimator. The standard\ndeviation of the similarity weighted estimator, however,\nis only slightly larger than the standard deviation of the\nunweighted estimator and much smaller than the standard deviation of the exponentially weighted estimator.\n\nV.\n\nAPPLICATION TO FINANCIAL DATA\n\nIn this section, we apply our estimator to financial data\nin the context of mean-variance portfolio allocation. The\napplication is motivated by Engle and Colacito (2006)\nwho showed that the realized volatility of theoretically\noptimal portfolios is lowest if the covariance matrices\nfor the optimization process are correctly specified.

We consider the minimum-variance portfolio\n(MVP ), i.e., the portfolio of minimal variance without\nfurther constraints, and the portfolio with minimal variance under the constraint of a fixed target portfolio return R (TRP ). The minimum-variance portfolio is the\nsolution of equation (8) when \u03b3 is set to zero, i.e., the\ninvestor is not risk tolerant.

(2010) argue that\nminimum-variance portfolios outperform various other\nstrategies of portfolio optimization, even with respect to\nthe their return.\nBy contrast, DeMiguel et al. (2009) raise the question\nwhether portfolio optimization pays out at all. In their\nresults, optimized portfolios do not significantly outperform naive diversified portfolios, i.e., portfolios where the\nsame amount 1/n is invested in n assets. We therefore\ninclude this naive portfolio in our study, even though the\nnaive portfolio does not depend on estimators of correlation or covariance. The portfolio strategies MVP and\nTRP allow to rank the estimators of the covariance structure according to the portfolio performance, while the\noutcomes of the naive portfolio confirm the overall plausibility of the results.\nThe basic idea of the study is to calculate optimal portfolios for every day of our dataset and to evaluate them\nover some investment horizon T with respect to risk (realized volatility) and return. We then compare the results\nof the different strategies and estimators.\nWe use the same dataset as in section II, i.e., the 471\nassets of the S&P 500 index that are included in the index\nfrom 2005 to the beginning of 2010. From this dataset, we\nrandomly choose 10 portfolio constellations of 100 stocks\neach. For every trading day from Aug 2008 to Nov 2009\nwe compute portfolio weights for the constellations regarding to the 3 strategies. The necessary covariance\nestimates rely on the similarity weighted estimator and\nalternatively on the unweighted estimator.

Window lengths between 30 to 70 trading days lead to similar results. However, the results for\nwindow lengths around 50 seem to be quite representative. The weighting scheme of the estimator includes the\ns = 300 most similar past days. The unweighted estimator is based on a moving window of 300 days. The\nweights of the target return portfolio rely on an additionally specified target return R and on estimates of the\nvector \u03bc of expected returns as well. The vector \u03bc is estimated by the returns of the portfolio's stocks for every\ntrading day from a moving window of 14 trading days.\nThe target return is then adaptively chosen to be 5\npercentage points above the average entree of \u03bc.\nThe evaluation results of realized volatility and returns\nare shown in Fig. 5, 4 and tables IV and V.
