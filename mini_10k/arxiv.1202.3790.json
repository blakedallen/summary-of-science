All active galactic\nnuclei are now believed to be similar objects, whose gross\nobservational features depend on the black hole mass, the\naccretion rate, the viewing angle and the presence of a jet\n(Rawlings 1994). Our understanding of finer details is, however, far from complete: each source has its own list of peculiarities that are difficult to explain coherently in the framework of the unified model. Furthermore, the values of the\nblack hole mass, that can be inferred only indirectly, are\nstill uncertain. Identification and analysis of peculiar features in single sources is thus important to improve our understanding of the AGN phenomenon. In this context the\nFermi blazar B2 0954+25A (= OK 290 = TXS 0953+254),\ndetected in the \u03b3\u2013ray band by the Fermi satellite, has several interesting features worth investigating. Interest for this\nsource has been stimulated by the wide range of values for its\nblack hole mass and width of hydrogen Balmer lines found\nin literature.\nAt optical wavelengths the source has been observed in\nat least three emission states: the partially jet dominated\nstate in 1987 (Jackson & Browne 1991), as observed by the\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: giorgio.calderone@mib.infn.it\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\nIsaac Newton Telescope (INT); the disk dominated state in\n2004, as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS,\nAbazajian et al. 2009); and the completely jet dominated\nstate in 2006, observed again with the SDSS. The optical\nspectrum reveals that the H\u03b2 emission line shows an asymmetry in its red wing, as observed in many AGNs. This\nasymmetry is one of the likely reasons for the different values of the black hole mass found in the literature. Depending\non the decomposition made to analyze the optical spectrum,\nthe FWHM of the H\u03b2 broad line may be lower than the\nthreshold of 2000 km s\u22121 , commonly used to classify Narrow\nLine Seyfert 1 (NLS1) sources, and the resulting black hole\nmass would be \u223c 108 M\u2299 (\u00a74.3.1). Although there is nothing\nspecial in the 2000 km s\u22121 threshold (e.g. Goodrich 1989;\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. 2001), we believe that such a low mass\nprovides a hint for a resemblance of B2 0954+25Awith NLS1\nsources (\u00a76). Indeed, its spectral energy distribution (SED)\nis almost identical to PMN J0948+0022 (Abdo et al. 2009b;\nFoschini et al. 2009), the first radio loud NLS1 detected by\nFermi. In this case the source would join the small group\nof radio\u2013loud NLS1 that have been detected by the Fermi\nsatellite (Abdo et al. 2009a,c; Foschini 2011).\nIn this work we present a multi\u2013wavelength study on B2\n0954+25A, with particular emphasis on the spectral analysis at optical wavelengths, broad\u2013band SED modeling and\nradio properties. Our aim is to provide a coherent picture of\nits physical properties, according to observational data. Our\n\n\f2\n\nG. Calderone et al.\n\nTable 1.

Here we provide\na brief description of data analysis for each of the facilities:\n\nTHE SOURCE B2 0954+25A\n\nThe source B2 0954+25A (z=0.712, Burbidge & Strittmatter 1972) is a compact, radio\u2013loud, flat\u2013spectrum radio\nquasar (FSRQ). It has been frequently used in statistical\nstudies on radio properties of quasars since it is a relatively\nluminous radio source (&1 Jy, Kuehr et al. 1981), whose\nemission extends to very low radio\u2013frequencies (74 MHz,\nCohen et al. 2007). The radio spectrum is usually flat and\nbecomes inverted during burst activity (Torniainen et al.\n2005). The jet is clearly visible in several radio maps: see e.g.\nthe VLA radio maps at 1.64 GHz in Murphy et al. (1993) and\nthe VLBA radio maps at 22 and 43 GHz in Lister & Smith\n(2000). The core component has angular size \u223c 0.23 \u00d7 0.07\nmas (at 15 GHz), corresponding to a linear size of 1.6 \u00d7 0.49\npc (Kovalev et al. 2005). Several components in the jet show\nsuperluminal motion (up to 12c, Kellermann et al. 2004). A\none\u2013sided jet (projected size \u223c50 kpc) extends from the core\nin the south\u2013west direction (Liu & Zhang 2002).\nIn the optical band, the source is unresolved, variable (Pica et al. 1988) and slightly polarized (1.29%, Wills\net al. 1992), with mi \u223c18 mag. The bolometric luminosity (estimated from SED fitting, Woo & Urry 2002) is\nlog(Lbol /erg s\u22121 ) = 46.59. Virial black hole mass estimates\nare log(M/M\u2299 )=8.7 (Liu et al. 2006) and log(M/M\u2299 )=9.5\n(Gu et al. 2001). Both these estimates rely on a FWHM estimate of the H\u03b2 emission line given in Jackson & Browne\n(1991), who found FWHM(H\u03b2) = 65 \u00c5 (rest frame), corresponding to \u223c4000 km s\u22121 . The source is also present in\nthe Shen et al. (2010, hereafter S10) catalog, which contains\nseveral measures obtained by automatically analyzing the\nSDSS/DR7 spectrum. S10 report a FWHM(H\u03b2) = 1870 km\ns\u22121 and log(M/M\u2299 )=8.6 (computed with H\u03b2), or 9.3 (computed with MgII). The spectrum analyzed in S10 is exactly\nthe same as the one we use in \u00a74.\nSeveral X\u2013ray facilities (Swift/XRT, Chandra, ROSAT,\nEinstein) observed the source at different times measuring\nfluxes in the range (2.5\u201320) \u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (\u00a72.1 and\nFig. 1). Finally, B2 0954+25A is present in both the 1yr\nand 2yr Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) point source\n\nFermi/LAT - The 2LAC catalog (Ackermann et al. 2011)\nreports a flux for the source of (2.1 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 at 618 MeV, and a photon index \u0393 = \u22122.39 \u00b1 0.08.\nWe also ran a likelihood analysis on the first 34 months\nof data collected by Fermi/LAT (using ScienceTools ver.\n9.23.1 and Instrument Response Function P6 V3) with time\nbins of one month, to check for the occurrence of major\nflares. We found no significant variability of the flux nor of\nthe spectral index, i.e. a constant flux and spectral index\nmodel fits well observational data and cannot be rejected on\nstatistical basis. The flux in the 0.1\u2013100 GeV band averaged\nover 34 months is compatible with the value reported in\n2LAC.\nSwift/XRT - On June 1st, 2007 Swift performed a pointed\nobservation (obsID 00036325002) of a nearby source, thus it\nhas been possible to extract data for B2 0954+25A. We extracted a spectrum using the xrtpipeline script and binned\nit to have at least 20 counts in each bin. Then we used\nXSPEC to fit a simple power law with the hydrogen column\nfixed to the Galactic value NH = 3.2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . The resulting de\u2013absorbed flux in the 0.3\u201310 keV energy band is\n(2.5 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and the photon index is\n\u0393 = 1.74 \u00b1 0.09.\nChandra - On June 20th, 2009 Chandra pointed our source.\nWe extracted a spectrum using the specextract script, with\na minimum of 30 counts in each bin, then performed a fit\nagainst a simple power law using Sherpa. Again the NH\ncolumn has been kept fixed to 3.2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . The resulting de\u2013absorbed flux in the 0.3\u201310 keV energy band is\n(1.32 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and the photon index is\n\u0393 = 1.75 \u00b1 0.07.\nGALEX - on Feb 5th, 2006 GALEX observed the source\nand provided the following photometric measurements:\n1 Nasa/IPAC Extragalactic Database http://http://ned.ipac.\ncaltech.edu/\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fB2 0954+25A: a typical blazar or a \u03b3\u2013NLS1?\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

Using a colour excess E(B\u2013V) =\n0.0377 we computed the de\u2013reddened fluxes using CCM 1989\nparametrization (Cardelli et al. 1989).

Both data sets have been de-reddened using Cardelli\net al. (1989).\n2MASS - An IR observation of the source has been performed on Nov 30th, 1998 and results are available in\nthe 2MASS catalog.

Calderone et al.\n\nfacilities described in \u00a72.1) is shown in Fig. 1. Grey crosses\nare from radio facilities, black squares are from Sloan photometry, red butterfly is from ROSAT, purple diamond\nis from Einstein. We added the data from Fermi/Large\nArea Telescope (LAT, black butterflies), Swift/X\u2013Ray Telescope (XRT, blue dots), Chandra (green butterfly), GALEX\n(orange open circles), Swift/UltraViolet Optical Telescope\n(UVOT) (blue circles) and 2MASS (red triangles). Colors of\nsimultaneous observations (Swift/XRT and UVOT, SDSS\nspectroscopic and GALEX) are the same. Looking at the\nSED in optical/UV it is clear that the source raised its flux\nby a factor \u223c10 in about one year. In June 2007 the source\nreturned to a lower state (in optical/UV) as shown by the\nSwift/UVOT measurements. Thus, the source shows at least\na \"low\" and a \"high\" state in optical/UV. A similar trend,\nalthough of smaller magnitude, is shown at X\u2013ray wavelengths with the lowest flux being measured by ROSAT and\nthe highest being measured by Einstein.\nIn the following sections we will focus on specific wavelengths range, namely radio (\u00a73) and optical (\u00a74), and then\nprovide an overall picture of the broad band SED (\u00a75).\n\n3\n\nRADIO PROPERTIES\n\nB2 0954+25A shows a flat radio spectrum from \u223c 108 Hz to\n\u223c 1011 Hz. At 5 GHz, the luminosity of the core is log(Lc /erg\ns\u22121 Hz\u22121 ) = 34.5, while that of the extended region is\nlog(Le /erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ) = 32.4, thus the source is highly core\u2013\ndominated with a core dominance parameter Rcd \u223c 100,\ni.e. at the higher end of the core\u2013dominance parameter distribution (Browne & Murphy 1987). The weakness of the\nextended emission is also evident at low radio frequencies,\nbecause the radio spectrum remains flat down to 74 MHz,\nwith a spectral index \u03b1 \u223c \u22120.2 between 74 and 365 MHz\n(F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ). Assuming a spectral index for the optically thin\nemission in the extended region of \u20130.7, and extrapolating\nthe flux from 5 GHz, the frequency at which the isotropic\nand the beamed jet luminosities are equal is \u223c10 MHz, in\nagreement with the observed overall flat radio spectral index. This suggests that the jet is well aligned along the line\nof sight.\nWe can compare the 74\u2013365 MHz radio spectral index \u03b1\nof B2 0954+25A with the distribution of the same spectral\nindex of other blazars. To this aim we show in Fig. 2 the\ndistribution of spectral index between the (observed) frequencies 74 and 365 MHz for three different blazar catalogs:\nCRATES (Healey et al. 2007, blue line), BZCAT (Massaro\net al. 2009, red line) and Fermi 2yr source catalog of AGN\n(2LAC, all \"CLEAN\" sources, Ackermann et al. 2011, black\nline). The radio fluxes to compute the spectral index are\ntaken from the VLA survey at 74 MHz (Cohen et al. 2007)\nand the Texas survey at 365 MHz (Douglas et al. 1996).\nThe number of sources detected at both frequencies is 1282\nfor the CRATES catalog; 605 for the BZCAT and 218 for\nthe Fermi 2LAC catalog. The distribution shows that only\n\u223c30% of the highly beamed blazars detected by Fermi have\na steep (\u03b1 < \u22120.5) spectral index between 74 and 365 MHz.\nRadio\u2013selected blazars from CRATES show a broader distribution with \u223c50% sources having spectral index <\u20130.5.\nThe BZCAT distribution is similar to CRATES, although\nwith a larger fraction of very flat or inverted radio sources.\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of spectral index between the (observed)\nfrequencies 74 and 365 MHz for three different blazar catalogs:\nCRATES (Healey et al. 2007, blue dashed line), BZCAT (Massaro et al. 2009, red dotted line) and Fermi 2yr catalog of AGN\n(Ackermann et al. 2011, 2LAC, black solid line). Thicker lines\nshow cumulative fraction (values on right axis). Radio fluxes to\ncompute the spectral index are taken from the VLA survey at\n74 MHz (Cohen et al. 2007) and the Texas survey at 365 MHz\n(Douglas et al. 1996).\n\nThe extended region of B2 0954+25A, as observed in\nthe 1.64 GHz VLA radio map, has a projected size of \u223c50\nkpc (Murphy et al. 1993; Liu & Zhang 2002). This is rather\nlarge, especially considering that the viewing angle \u03b8v is\nsmall, as suggested by the observed superluminal motion\n(12c, Kellermann et al. 2004) and by the SED modeling\n(\u00a73.5 and Tab. 5). Assuming \u03b8v in the range 3\u20136 degrees,\nthe de\u2013projected size is then in the range 0.5\u20131 Mpc, typically the size of a giant radio lobe.\nWe conclude that the radio properties of B2 0954+25A\nindicate a highly core dominated source, with an extended\ncomponent that, albeit reaching the dimension of a giant\nradio lobe, is rather weak, making the core dominance parameter very large, at the high end of the distribution values\nfor blazars.\n\n4\n\nOPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY\n\nWe used optical spectra from the Isaac Newton Telescope\n(INT) and from SDSS3 (see Fig. 3). The spectrum from\nINT (observed on 16th Dec. 1987) has been derived directly\nfrom the plot given in Jackson & Browne (1991, their Fig.\n2), thus it is suitable only for a qualitative analysis. The\nspectrum from SDSS (observed on 5th Jan. 2006) has been\nautomatically flux\u2013 and wavelength\u2013calibrated by the SDSS\npipeline (Stoughton et al. 2002), de\u2013reddened using Cardelli\net al. (1989) with E(B\u2013V)=0.0375 (Schlegel et al. 1998),\ntransformed to rest frame of reference using our redshift\nestimate (z=0.70747, \u00a74.1) and rebinned by a factor of 2\n3\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr7. Data from DR8 does not differ significantly from DR7.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fB2 0954+25A: a typical blazar or a \u03b3\u2013NLS1?\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Optical spectrum of B2 0954+25A observed by SDSS in 2006 (red line, flux scale on the left axis) and with the Isaac\nNewton Telescope (INT) in 1987 (black line, flux scale on the right axis). The range of values covered by both axes is exactly the same\n(\u223c 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ) so that spectra can be directly compared. SDSS spectrum have been de\u2013reddened using Cardelli et al.\n(1989) with E(B\u2013V)=0.0375, transformed to the rest frame using our redshift estimate (z=0.70747, see text) and rebinned by a factor\nof 2. The INT spectrum has been derived from the plot given in Jackson & Browne (1991, their Fig. 2) and transformed to rest frame.\nThe \"S\" letter denote a telluric line. Some of the most important emission lines are highlighted. The spectra show that the continuum\nhas changed both in intensity (by a factor \u223c5) and in slope. The intensity and shape of the Balmer lines seem to be the same in both\nspectra.\n\nFigure 4.

Calderone et al.\n\n(Fig. 3, see Fig. 5 for a closer view of the H\u03b2 and [OIII]\nregion).\nFig. 4 shows the profiles of the main emission lines,\nnamely MgII (2800\u00c5), H\u03b2 (4863\u00c5) and [OIII] (5007\u00c5),\nin velocity space. The spectrum has been continuum\u2013\nsubtracted and all profiles have been normalized to have\nmaximum of 1. Finally all profiles have been smoothed by a\n\u223c4 \u00c5 boxcar average to provide a clearer view. The dashed\nlines allow to approximately measure the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of each line.\nTo provide a better estimate of the FWHM of the H\u03b2\nand [OIII] line profiles we also performed a fit of the spectrum using five components model (Model 1): a power\u2013\nlaw to account for the continuum emission, four Gaussian\u2013\nshaped emission lines to account for the H\u03b2 (both narrow\nand broad component) and the [OIII] 4959\u00c5, [OIII] 5007\u00c5\nlines. FWHM and velocity offset of the narrow lines are\nforced to be the same. Results are shown in Fig. 5 (upper\npanel). To account for residuals in the 4830 \u2013 4900\u00c5 range\n(i.e. the asymmetry in the broad H\u03b2 line) we ran another\nfit by adding another emission line component named H\u03b2 \u2217\n(Model 2, Fig. 5 lower panel).\n4.1\n\nResults\n\nA qualitative comparison of the spectra by INT and SDSS\ntaken \u223c9 years apart (Tab. 2) shows that the continuum\nhas changed both in intensity (by a factor \u223c5) and in slope.\nThe intensity and shape of the Balmer line seem to be the\nsame in both spectra. In \u00a72.1 we also analyze the broad\u2013\nband SED (lower panel of Fig. 1) of the source, considering also the photometric data from SDSS, taken \u223c1 year\nbefore the SDSS spectroscopic observations. Again, we see\nthat a change in intensity of the optical emission of a factor \u223c10 occurred in just 1 year. Also, a change in slope\noccurred, as indicated by the photometric data in the 5\navailable bands. Thus, we conclude that B2 0954+25A has\nbeen observed in at least three emission states at optical\nwavelengths, which differs in intensity: from the dimmer one\n(SDSS/photometric), through an intermediate one (INT), to\nthe brighter one (SDSS/spectroscopic). The spectral slope\nis correlated to the change of state. As discussed in \u00a75.2,\nthe change of state can be simply explained as a change of\nmagnetic field. A change in accretion rate is not needed,\ntherefore we do not expect any change in line luminosity\nand profile. We will refer to these optical emission states as\nthe disk dominated one, the intermediate state and the jet\ndominated state respectively, and discuss their properties in\n\u00a75.2.\nA quantitative spectral analysis can only be performed\non the SDSS spectrum. Fig. 4 clearly shows that our value\nof z=0.70747 locates the peak of the [OIII] line exactly at 0\nin velocity space, while the MgII peak is redshifted by \u223c300\nkm s\u22121 and the H\u03b2 peak is blueshifted by \u223c100 km s\u22121 .\nAlso, the H\u03b2 profile shows a pronounced asymmetry on the\nred wing. Rough estimates of the FWHMs are: 3050 km s\u22121\nfor the MgII line, 2600 km s\u22121 for the H\u03b2 line and \u223c480 km\ns\u22121 for the [OIII] line.\nTo provide better estimates of luminosities, widths and\noffsets of emission lines, and eventually highlight some peculiarities in the spectrum, we performed a fit with the models\ndescribed above. The spectrum in the 4800 \u2013 5100\u00c5 region,\n\nas well as the fitting model and the single components, are\nshown in Fig. 5 (Model 1 in upper panel, Model 2 in lower\npanel). Results are shown in Tab. 3.\nModel 1: The resulting FWHM for the H\u03b2 line is\n(2830 \u00b1 220) km s\u22121 , while the FWHM of the narrow lines\nis (430 \u00b1 24) km s\u22121 , grossly consistent with the rough estimates obtained with Fig. 4. The model fits reasonably well\nthe spectrum, and the \u03c72 value is rather small. Also, the luminosity of the continuum at 5100\u00c5 and the spectral slope,\nas well as the sum of luminosities from broad and narrow\nH\u03b2 lines and [OIII] luminosities, are consistent with the fit\nperformed in S10 (Tab. 3), thus our model does not suffer\nfrom lack of iron line modeling (which is present in their fit).\nThe value of FWHM and velocity offset for both the broad\nand narrow components of H\u03b2 are however, quite different.\nThe strong discrepancies in FWHM between our results and\nthose from S10 are probably due to the fact that we had the\nopportunity to carefully check the results of the fit, while in\nS10 an automatic fitting pipeline had to be used to handle\nthe many spectra contained in the catalog.\nModel 2: The residuals of the fit in Model 1 (Fig. 5,\nupper panel) look random everywhere, except in two regions: 4840\u20134900\u00c5 and 4930\u20134945\u00c5, in which the residuals are quite \"coherent\", suggesting the presence of further\ncomponents. Although the model is far from being rejected\n(\u03c72red < 1) these residuals are due to the asymmetry in\nthe broad H\u03b2 profile discussed above, and to an additional\nemission line. Thus, we ran again the fit with a new broad\nH\u03b2\u2013like component, named H\u03b2 \u2217 in Tab. 3 (actually we are\nnot interested in the additional line at 4940\u00c5). Results are\nshown in Fig. 5 (lower panel) and Tab. 3. The extra component accounts well for the asymmetry of the H\u03b2 profile,\nand the residuals in the region now look random. The same\nconsideration as for Model 1 applies for the luminosity and\nslope of the continuum, and the luminosity of the H\u03b2 and\n[OIII] lines. Clearly, the putative broad H\u03b2 line is now much\nnarrower (\u223c1500 km s\u22121 ). Furthermore, the new H\u03b2 \u2217 component has the same FWHM and velocity offset as the broad\nH\u03b2 values given in S10. This provides a possible explanation\nfor the discrepancies between our results and those from S10.\nIn summary, our Model 2 seems to be the best description of the spectrum of B2 0954+25A in the 4810 \u2013 5100 \u00c5\nrange.\n4.2\n\nThe H\u03b2 line profile\n\nThe FWHM value of the H\u03b2 line profile reported in literature is 65 \u00c5 (Jackson & Browne 1991). As shown in Tab.\n4 the FWHM found with both Model 1 and 2 of our fit is\nsignificantly lower (46 \u00c5 and 24 \u00c5 respectively). Since the\nH\u03b2 profiles observed with INT and SDSS (Fig. 3) overlap\nperfectly, we can exclude a variation in the line profile, and\nconclude that previous value was likely overestimated. Moreover, the value reported in S10 is perfectly compatible with\nour estimate in Model 1 (48 \u00c5, Tab.4).\nFig. 5 show that the broad H\u03b2 emission line can hardly\nbe modeled with a single Gaussian profile, nor with any\nsymmetric line profile such as the often quoted logarithmic profile (Blumenthal & Mathews 1975), since the red\nwing is highly asymmetric. Iron emission lines in the range\n4840\u20134900 \u00c5 are usually much weaker than the Balmer lines\n(Capriotti et al. 1979), thus such profile is hardly the result\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fB2 0954+25A: a typical blazar or a \u03b3\u2013NLS1?\n\n7\n\nFigure 5.

Iron lines may be present\nbut their intensity is negligible, indeed our fitting procedure\nprovide the same results for line luminosities and width of\nnarrow lines as reported in S10 (\u00a74.1). Asymmetric H\u03b2 line\nprofiles are not new in Type 1 AGN spectra: both red and\nblue asymmetries has been observed in all kind of AGNs (e.g.\nCapriotti et al. 1979, 1980; Peterson et al. 1987; Stirpe 1990;\nRomano et al. 1996; V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. 2001), as well as profile variability (Osterbrock & Phillips 1977; Peterson 1987;\nStirpe et al. 1988). Several kinematic models have been proposed to explain such features in the broad Balmer spectra of\nAGN, including radial inflow or outflow, different geometries\nand multiple components BLR (e.g. Peterson 1987; Popovi\u0107\net al. 2004; Romano et al. 1996; Zhu et al. 2009), but no\none has yet reached a general consensus. This hints for the\npresence of non virialized components in the BLR region.\nThus, measures of FWHM performed on such profiles may\nnot be directly related to the underlying black hole mass.\nThis is the reason why we used the FWHM of just the main\nH\u03b2 line to estimate the virial black hole mass, neglecting the\nadditional H\u03b2 \u2217 component which account for the asymmetry. Doing so, the FWHM of H\u03b2 turns out to be about half\nthe FWHM of MgII (Fig. 4). Such differences are common\nin sources with small values of FWHM(H\u03b2): in the S10 catalog, the MgII line is wider than H\u03b2 for \u223c84% of the sources\nwith FWHM(H\u03b2)< 2000, and only 22% of the sources with\nFWHM(H\u03b2)> 4000.\n\nOf course the reasoning can be inverted: the \"real\" H\u03b2\nline profile may be much wider, but some intervening gas\ncould absorb radiation only on the blue side. Although we\nhave no evidence to exclude this hypothesis, the range of\nvalues for the black hole mass found in \u00a74.3 marginally supports the hypothesis that the real virialized line profile is the\none modeled with the main H\u03b2 component. This conclusion\nmay have important consequences on the classification of\nB2 0954+25A. Should the additional H\u03b2 \u2217 component vanish\nin future observations, the FWHM of the remaining, virialized, H\u03b2 component would be \u223c1500 km s\u22121 , and the source\nwould become a powerful \u03b3-RL-NLS1.

The former is obtained by scaling the luminosity of one emission line (e.g. H\u03b2) to obtain the total\nBLR luminosity, LBLR , through a template quasar spectrum\n(Francis et al. 1991). Lbol can then be computed by dividing LBLR by the covering factor, assumed to be 0.1. Black\nhole masses are usually estimated assuming virialized motion of BLR clouds. The BLR radius has been measured by\nmeans of the reverberation mapping technique (RM, Peterson 1993) for a few tens of objects, and a correlation between the continuum optical luminosity and the BLR size,\nhas been calibrated (R\u2013L relation, Kaspi et al. 2005; Vestergaard & Peterson 2006; Bentz et al. 2009), so that we can\ninfer RBLR size without the (very time\u2013consuming) RM observational campaigns. Thus, it is in principle possible to\nestimate black hole masses using single\u2013epoch optical spectroscopy (such as the SDSS spectrum of B2 0954+25A used\nin \u00a74) and a calibrated virial mass scaling relationship (such\nas those reported in Vestergaard & Peterson (2006)). There\nare, however, several caveats, such as the geometry and orientation of the BLR (Decarli et al. 2011), the role of radiation pressure (Marconi et al. 2008, 2009) and the way line\nprofiles should be analyzed to infer the orbital velocity of\nthe clouds. Indeed, the H\u03b2 broad line is often asymmetric,\nthus the broadening cannot be simply interpreted as being\ndue to orbital bulk motion. In these cases is not clear what\nmeasure should be taken for the line width. Note also that\nRM studies have been carried out mainly on radio\u2013quiet\nsources, i.e. sources in which synchrotron emission from a jet\nat optical/IR wavelengths is negligible with respect to the\nemission from the so called Big Blue Bump (BBB). Thus,\nthe R\u2013L relations are reliable only when the BBB is clearly\nvisible (Wu et al. 2004). Contribution from host starlight\nis also supposed to be an issue (e.g. Bentz et al. 2009), although only in low luminosity AGN (log(\u03bbL\u03bb ,5100\u00c5)<44.5,\nShen et al. 2010), therefore not in the case of B2 0954+25A.\nFinally, the 1\u03c3 statistical dispersion of virial mass scaling\nrelationships against RM\u2013based masses is estimated to be\n\u223c0.5 dex. The RM masses are in turn scattered by the same\nfactor around the M \u2013\u03c3 relation (Onken et al. 2004). The\nabsolute accuracy is therefore estimated to be of the order\nof 0.7 dex (Vestergaard & Peterson 2006).\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fB2 0954+25A: a typical blazar or a \u03b3\u2013NLS1?\nWe will consider virial mass estimates computed using both Model 1 and 2. Also, the SDSS spectrum of B2\n0954+25A has been taken when the source was in the jet\ndominated state, therefore we cannot use the continuum luminosity estimated from spectral analysis to infer the BLR\nsize. Instead, we will use optical data of the disk dominated\nstate, as observed photometrically by SDSS.\n\n4.3.1\n\nResults\n\nTo compute LBLR , and the disk bolometric luminosity Lbol ,\nwe use the composite quasar spectrum given in Francis et al.\n(1991), including the H\u03b1 contribution as in Celotti et al.\n(1997). The broad H\u03b2 line contributes to the entire LBLR\nwith a weight 22/555 (the Ly\u03b1 contributes for 100/555).\nUsing the luminosity of the H\u03b2 complex found with Model\n2 fitting (broad H\u03b2 line + H\u03b2 \u2217 component, log(L(H\u03b2)/erg\ns\u22121 ) = 43.4), and setting Lbol = 10LBLR , we estimate\nlog(Lbol /erg s\u22121 ) = 45.8. This value agrees with the one\nderived in \u00a75 through SED modeling: log(Lbol /erg s\u22121 ) =\n46. Instead, S10 reports log(Lbol /erg s\u22121 ) = 47, because\nS10 used an observation made when the source was in the\njet dominated state.\nTab. 4 reports the black hole mass estimates for B2\n0954+25A obtained using different methods and calibrations. For all estimates, except the last two, we used the\nvirial mass scaling relations. The first two estimates are\ncomputed using the FWHM estimates (of the broad component and the whole profile respectively) of the MgII emission line provided by S10, the continuum luminosity derived\nfrom SDSS photometry (when the source was in the disk\ndominated state) of log(\u03bdL\u03bd /erg s\u22121 ) = 45.7 and the same\ncalibrations used in S10: Shen et al. (2010) and Vestergaard\n& Osmer (2009) respectively. The mass estimates are very\nsimilar, so we will refer to them as the MgII virial mass\nestimates (log M/M\u2299 \u223c 9).\nThe next two estimates are computed using the FWHM\nof the H\u03b2 emission line fitted with a single Gaussian. Values\nfor FWHM are provided by S10 and by our Model 1 respectively, the continuum luminosity is derived from SDSS photometry (disk dominated state): log(\u03bdL\u03bd /erg s\u22121 ) = 45.3,\nand the calibration are from Vestergaard & Peterson (2006,\nsame as S10) and Bentz et al. (2009), respectively. This\npair of mass estimates are also very similar, so we will\nrefer to them as the single H\u03b2 virial mass estimates (log\nM/M\u2299 \u223c 8.5).\nNext estimate is computed using the FWHM of the H\u03b2\nemission line from Model 2, neglecting the additional H\u03b2 \u2217\ncomponent, and the calibration by Bentz et al. (2009).\nFinally, the last two rows of Tab. 4 report mass estimates obtained without using the virial method. For the\nfirst one we used the FWHM of the [OIII] line (provided\nby Model 2 fitting) as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion, and the calibration of the M \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation given\nin Tremaine et al. (2002, their Eq. 20). Updated calibration\ngiven in Graham et al. (2011) produces the same result. In\nthe last one we simply report the mass estimate obtained in\n\u00a75 through SED modeling. Notice that the last three methods yield very similar results (log M/M\u2299 \u223c 8), even if they\nhave been derived using different and independent methods.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n4.3.2\n\n9\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur black hole mass estimates are considerably lower than\nthose found in the literature (\u00a72). This is likely a consequence of the different values of the H\u03b2 line profile's width,\nas discussed in 4.2. Also, the mass given in S10 is probably overestimated since the continuum luminosity has been\nmeasured while the source was in the jet dominated state.\nTherefore, we will consider only our mass estimates given in\nTab. 4.\nIn particular, the estimate obtained with Model 2\n(neglecting the H\u03b2 \u2217 component), and the M -\u03c3 relation\n(log(M/M\u2299 ) \u223c8) are quite independent, thus they provide\ngreater confidence about the goodness of the mass estimate.\nModeling the disk dominated state with a standard (i.e.\nShakura & Sunyaev 1973) disk (\u00a75.2) yields estimates of\nthe black hole mass between (1.5 \u2212 5) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Smaller\nmasses are excluded because the disk would become super\u2013\nEddington, larger masses are excluded because, beside providing a worse fit to the near\u2013IR and optical data of the\n\"disk\u2013dominated\" state, they require a smaller ionizing luminosity, that becomes incompatible with the luminosity of\nthe broad line region. We therefore conclude that the black\nhole mass of B2 0954+25A is in the range log(M/M\u2299 ) =\n8\u20138.5.\n\n5\n\nMODELING THE SED\n\nTo model the SED we use the one\u2013zone leptonic model described in detail in Ghisellini & Tavecchio (2009), whose\nmain characteristics are briefly described in the Appendix.\nThe SED of the source is shown in Fig. 1. The lower panel\nshows a zoom of the optical, X\u2013ray and \u03b3\u2013ray data part of\nthe SED, together with the models used to interpret the two\nstates of the source. As discussed above, SDSS observed B2\n0954+25A in two occasions, approximately one year apart.\nIn the first observation the SDSS made the photometry in\nits usual optical filters (black squares in Fig. 1), while the\nspectrum, one year later, revealed a very high state, dominated by the beamed synchrotron emission (orange lines),\nin agreement with the GALEX observations (orange open\ncircles).\nFor the low optical state we have simultaneous UVOT\nand XRT Swift observations: the UVOT point (blue filled\ncircle) agrees with the photometric SDSS data points (black\nsquares) and with the 2MASS data (red triangles). We have\nthen modeled these data together with the XRT X\u2013ray data,\nassuming also that the average Fermi/LAT flux and spectrum is a good representation of the high energy emission of\nthis state.\nOn the other hand we have no information about the\nlevel of the \u03b3\u2013ray flux for the high optical state of the source.\nWe therefore assume that it corresponds also to a high state\nof the X\u2013ray emission, that can be represented by the maximum X\u2013ray flux observed (violet diamond point), and to\nthe same \u03b3\u2013ray flux.\nThe Chandra and Fermi data shown as green/black ties\nare simultaneous (even if the Fermi spectrum is the average of 34 months of observations), but we do not have\nany information about the optical\u2013UV state. During the 34\nmonths of Fermi observations, the \u03b3\u2013ray flux was rather\n\n\f10\n\nG. Calderone et al.\nTable 4. Black hole mass estimates using different methods and calibrations.

The one\u2013zone\nleptonic model (in which optical and \u03b3\u2013ray radiation are\nproduced by the same population of electrons) is perfectly\nsuitable to describe this SED. Detection of optical variability without corresponding changes in simultaneous \u03b3\u2013ray\nobservations would be, however, difficult to accomodate in\nthe framework of the one\u2013zone leptonic model.\nIn Tab. 5 we list the relevant parameters used to interpret the two states of the source, namely the disk and the jet\ndominated one. Tab. 6 reports the jet powers corresponding\nto the two states, calculated as explained in the Appendix.\n\n5.1\n\nGuidelines for the choice of the parameters\n\nAccretion disk - The luminosity of the accretion disk can be\nestimated through the luminosity of the broad emission lines\nLBLR , assuming a given value for the covering factor. As discussed in detail in \u00a74.3, we can estimate LBLR \u223c 6.3 \u00d7 1044\nerg s\u22121 . Assuming a covering factor of \u223c0.1, the disk luminosity is of the order of 1046 erg s\u22121 . Given the uncertainties about LBLR , derived using only the H\u03b2 line, the covering factor and the mass of the black hole (controlling the\nLd /Lion ratio), this estimate necessarily has an uncertainty\nof at least a factor 2.\nLocation of the emitting region - The SED in the low state\nshows that the high energy hump dominates the bolometric\noutput, as in other powerful Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars\n(FSRQs). In these objects it is likely that the emitting region\nis located inside the BLR, since in these cases the seed photons produced by the BLR, whose flux is seen enhanced in\nthe comoving frame of the emitting region, dominate the radiative cooling. We then assume Rdiss < RBLR , where Rdiss\nis the distance of the emitting region from the black hole,\n1/2\nand RBLR \u223c 1017 Ld,45 cm is the size of the BLR.\nMagnetic field - The value of the magnetic field is chosen\nin order to reproduce the ratio between the synchrotron and\nthe inverse Compton flux.\nBulk Lorentz factor - This has been chosen in order to\nreproduce the superluminal apparent velocity (\u03b2app \u223c 12,\nKellermann et al. 2004). This also fixes the viewing angle,\nthat must be of the order of 1/\u0393. Note that the value of \u0393\n\nlog M/M\u2299\n[4]\n9.0\n8.8\n8.6\n8.5\n7.9\n8.0\n8.2\n\nEdd. ratio\n[5]\n0.1\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n1.1\n0.9\n0.6\n\nCalib. ref.\n[6]\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(d)\n(e)\n\ndetermines the value of the radiation energy density of the\nexternal seed photons (\u221d \u03932 ) and hence the value of the\nmagnetic field required to have the observed synchrotron to\ninverse Compton luminosity ratio.\nInjected power - The power is injected throughout the\nsource in the form of relativistic electrons. Through the continuity equation we calculate the particle distribution as a\nresult of injection, cooling and possible pair production. The\ntotal injected power is such that the radiation produced by\nthese particles agrees with the observed data. The injected\ndistribution is assumed to be a smoothly broken power law.\nThe resulting distribution, modified by cooling, must agree\nwith the observed slopes.\n5.2\n\nResults\n\nThe most notable feature of B2 0954+25A is the large variability in the optical, from a disk to a jet dominated emission. This is interpreted as a change in the magnetic field,\nfrom \u223c 5 to 20 G, accompanied by an increase of the total\ninjected power (by a factor 2), and a decrease in the maximum particles energy and a flattening of the high energy\nslope of the particle distribution. The location of the emitting region is somewhat less in the high optical state. We\nmaintained the same bulk Lorentz factor. The power of the\njet of B2 0954+25A carried by the magnetic field is larger\nin the high optical state (factor 10), while the differences in\nthe other forms of power are minor. The jet power (Pp + Pe )\nis dominated by the bulk motion of protons. An electron to\n(cold) proton ratio of \u223c 1 results in Pp \u223c (2 \u2212 5) \u00d7 1047\nerg. The jet power decreases by a factor of 20 if there are 20\nelectron\u2013positron pairs per proton. Such a lepton to proton\nratio is about the maximum allowed to make the jet not to\nrecoil under the Compton drag effect (Ghisellini & Tavecchio\n2010). A value Pp \u223c 2 \u00d7 1046 erg s\u22121 makes the jet power\nsimilar to the accretion disk luminosity (which is slightly\nlarger than 1046 erg s\u22121 ). The minimum value of jet power\nis the one needed to produce the observed radiation, that\nis of the order of Pr \u223c Lobs /\u03932 = (3\u20137)\u00d71044 erg s\u22121 . Even\nthis absolute lower limit on the jet power contrasts with the\nabsence of a strong extended emission (see \u00a73). In fact, following Willott et al. (1999), we can estimate the jet power\nQ from the extended luminosity at 151 MHz.

We have used a black hole mass M = 1.5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . We\nhave also fitted the spectrum with larger black hole masses,\nand obtain equally good fits with M = 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (and\nLd /LEdd = 0.34) and M = 5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (and Ld /LEdd =\n0.17). Both these alternative solutions are acceptable since\nthey provide a sufficient Lion to photoionize the BLR. If\nM = 109 M\u2299 , instead, the computed disk emission shifts to\nsmaller frequencies (i.e. the disk becomes colder) and then\nwe are obliged to decrease its overall luminosity. As a consequence, we cannot reproduce the Swift/UVOT u point,\nand the ionizing luminosity becomes too small to efficiently\nphotoionize the BLR.\nThe picture that emerges is that of a typical Fermi\nblazar, with a flat radio spectrum produced by a powerful\njet, and black hole mass significantly smaller than 109 M\u2299 .\nThe source periodically cycles through different emission\nstates, characterized by different amount of power emitted\nby the jet. Although the SED parameters are only rough estimates of physical quantities, the possibility to model two\ndifferent states of the same source provides at least a clue\nthat the parameters kept fixed in both models (black hole\nmass, disk luminosity, BLR radius, covering factor) are reliable.\n\n6\n\nCOMPARISON WITH 3C 273 AND PMN\nJ0948+0022\n\nIn Fig. 6 we compare the broad band SED of B2 0954+25A\nto that of 3C 273 (upper panel) and PMN J0948+0022\n(lower panel). Both sources have been analyzed in Ghisellini\net al. (2010) and model parameters are reported in Tab.\n5 and 6. The radio spectrum of the prototypical blazar 3C\n273 shows a flat spectrum comparable in luminosity with B2\n0954+25A, although slightly steeper. At the lowest observed\nfrequencies the two SED are markedly different: whereas the\n74\u2013365 MHz radio spectral index of 3C 273 become steep\n(\u03b1 \u223c \u22120.5), the spectral index of B2 0954+25A remains\nflat (\u03b1 \u223c \u22120.2). As discussed in \u00a73, this behaviour can be\nexplained with a different amount of relativistic beaming\nwhich boosts the jet emission in B2 0954+25A. At shorter\nwavelengths 3C 273 is \u223c1 order of magnitude more powerful than B2 0954+25A. If emission in both sources occur at\napproximately the same Eddington ratio (0.4\u20130.6, Tab. 5)\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\nFigure 6. Comparison of the SED of B2 0954+25A with the SED\nof 3C 273 (top panel) and PMN J0948+0022 (bottom).\n\nas suggested by SED modeling, the luminosity ratio at optical/UV wavelengths (\u223c 3) provides an estimate for the mass\nratio. Since log(M/M\u2299 ) of 3C 273 is 8.9, for B2 0954+25A\nwe expect a mass of \u223c8.4. This is yet another indication that\nthe black hole mass of B2 0954+25A should be significantly\nsmaller than log(M/M\u2299 ) = 9.\nAlso, the SED of PMN J0948+0022 is very similar to\nthat of B2 0954+25A (in the disk dominated state), the only\ndifference being at \u03b3\u2013rays (where PMN J0948+0022 showed\nan exceptional flaring episode (Foschini et al. 2011)). Parameters from the SED modeling and jet powers are quite\nsimilar (Tab. 5 and 6). This similarities support our speculation on the possible classification of B2 0954+25A as a\n\u03b3\u2013NLS1.\nHowever, this similarity cannot be pushed too far, since\nB2 0954+25A lacks the strong iron emission that usually characterizes NLS1. Also, X\u2013ray photon index of B2\n0954+25Ais \u0393 = 1.74 (\u00a72.1), while that of NLS1 is typically\n\u0393 > 2.5 (Boller et al. 1996). However, consider that also\nthe other NLS1 detected by Fermi have a flat X\u2013ray spectrum (Abdo et al. 2009b,c) likely because the flat X\u2013ray jet\nemission dominates.\n\n6.1\n\nTypical Fermi blazar or \u03b3-NLS1?\n\nAs discussed in \u00a75 and \u00a76, B2 0954+25A is a typical Fermi\nblazar. However, the likely small black hole mass of B2\n0954+25A and the SED resemblance with prototypical \u03b3\u2013\nNLS1 PMN J0948+0022 suggest some similarities between\nthe two sources. B2 0954+25A does not meet the commonly\nadopted classification criterion for NLS1, namely a FWHM\n\n\f12\n\nG.

The spectral shape of the corona is assumed to be \u221d \u03bd \u22121 exp(\u2212h\u03bd/150 keV).\n\nof broad H\u03b2 <2000 km s\u22121 (Osterbrock & Pogge 1985).4\nHowever, the physical nature of such empirical threshold\nhas been often questioned (e.g. Goodrich 1989; V\u00e9ron-Cetty\net al. 2001) since all observational properties show a continuous transition at FWHM(H\u03b2) \u223c2000 km s\u22121 , i.e. properties\nof NLS1 and BLS1 sources are smoothly joined.\nAlternative criteria to distinguish among BLS1 and\nNLS1 sources have been put forward. Sulentic et al. (2000)\nproposed to increase the dividing threshold to 4000 km s\u22121 ,\nto select radio\u2013quiet sources with low mass and high accretion rate. V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. (2001) suggested to consider the\nstrength of FeII emission relative to H\u03b2 as a possible tracer\nof the Eddington ratio. Netzer & Trakhtenbrot (2007) proposed to classify as narrow\u2013line AGN (NLAGN) all sources\nexceeding an Eddington ratio of 0.25 (regardless of black\nhole mass).\nA small black hole mass is likely a characterizing property of NLS1 sources (Grupe & Mathur 2004). We would like\nto stress that if asymmetry in broad Balmer line profiles are\ndue to non-virialized components in the BLR, then only the\nvirialized one should be considered to estimate the black\nhole mass, and thus the NLS1 classification. In this case B2\n0954+25A would be classified as a powerful \u03b3\u2013NLS1, just\nlike PMN J0948+0022.\nSince the overall properties of B2 0954+25A are similar\nto both classes of Fermi blazars and \u03b3\u2013NLS1, we conclude\nthat it is one of those objects which smoothly joins the population of narrow\u2013line and broad\u2013line AGN.\n\n7\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we carried out an extensive analysis on the\nFermi blazar B2 0954+25A using archival data. We highlighted several peculiarities in the aim at providing a coherent picture of its physical properties. The main conclusions\nare as follows:\n\u2022 (\u00a72, \u00a72.1) the source B2 0954+25A is a strong \u03b3\u2013ray\nemitter, detected both in the 1yr and 2yr Fermi/LAT point\n\n4\n\nThe further criterion on flux ratio [OIII]/H\u03b2 <3 is almost always automatically satisfied when a broad H\u03b2 component is detected (e.g. Zhou et al. 2006).\n\nsource catalogs (Abdo et al. 2010, 2011). We find no significant variability of the flux nor of the spectral index in\nthe 0.1\u2013100 GeV band in the first 34 months of data from\nFermi/LAT.\n\u2022 (\u00a73) its radio spectrum is \"flat\" down to very low frequencies (74 MHz, Cohen et al. 2007), i.e. the optically thick\nsynchrotron emission from the jet is dominating over the optically thin, isotropic emission from extended region. This\nobservation indicates that the viewing angle must be small\n(3\u20136 degrees). The corresponding de\u2013projected size of the\njet is in the range 0.5\u20131 Mpc, the size of a giant radio lobe.\nThe isotropic and the beamed components should have equal\nluminosities at \u223c10 MHz.\n\u2022 (\u00a73, Fig. 2) the \"flatness\" of the radio spectrum at low\nfrequencies observed in B2 0954+25A is typical of Fermi\ndetected blazars (2LAC sample), i.e. well aligned blazars.\nRadio selected blazars show steeper spectra on average (e.g.\nthe CRATES sample).\n\u2022 (\u00a74.1, Fig. 1 and 3) B2 0954+25A has been observed in\nat least three different optical states: from a disk\u2013dominated\nstate, to a jet dominated one in which the synchrotron emission overwhelms the emission from the disk, via an intermediate state. The two extreme states differ by nearly one order\nof magnitude in luminosity. Despite the change in continuum luminosity, the broad hydrogen Balmer lines maintain\nthe same luminosity and line profile.\n\u2022 (\u00a74.1, Fig. 5, Tab. 3) the previously known estimate for\nthe FWHM of the broad H\u03b2 line profile (65 \u00c5 rest frame,\ncorresponding to \u223c4000 km s\u22121 ) from Jackson & Browne\n(1991) is probably overestimated. Also, the value of 1870\nkm s\u22121 reported in Shen et al. (2010) is probably due to a\npoor model fit. A more likely value is 46 \u00c5, corresponding\nto \u223c2800 km s\u22121 . The broad H\u03b2 line shows a pronounced\nasymmetry on the red wing, which require a second Gaussian\ncomponent (H\u03b2 \u2217 ) of similar FWHM, to be modeled. The\nvelocity offset of the H\u03b2 \u2217 is \u223c1200 km s\u22121 .\n\u2022 (\u00a74.1, Fig. 4) [OIII] 5007\u00c5 and MgII lines are quite\nsymmetric. The FWHM of the MgII line is \u223c 3050 km s\u22121 ,\nand the peak is redshifted by \u223c300 km s\u22121 with respect to\nthe redshift identified by the [OIII] line.\n\u2022 (\u00a74.3, \u00a74.3.2) the most likely value of the black hole mass\nis M \u223c (1\u22123)\u00d7108 M\u2299 , as suggested by several independent\nmethods. In particular, for the mass scaling relations we\nconsidered only the symmetric component of the H\u03b2 profile,\nand the continuum luminosity in the disk dominated state.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fB2 0954+25A: a typical blazar or a \u03b3\u2013NLS1?\n\u2022 (\u00a75, Fig. 1, Tab. 5, \u00a76) modeling the broad band spectral energy distribution, we derive physical parameters quite\ntypical of other Fermi blazars.\n\u2022 (\u00a76) We suggest to classify B2 0954+25A as a transition object between the class of FSRQ and \u03b3-NLS1, since\nit shows characteristic features of both classes (namely, the\nblazar appearance and the similarity with the SED of PMN\nJ0948+0022).\n\nAPPENDIX A: APPENDIX: SOME DETAILS\nON THE MODELING\nWe use the model described in detail in Ghisellini & Tavecchio (2009). The emitting region is assumed spherical, at a\ndistance Rdiss from the black hole, of size R = \u03c8Rdiss (with\n\u03c8 = 0.1), and moving with a bulk Lorentz factor \u0393. The\nbolometric luminosity of the accretion disk is Ld .\nThe energy particle distribution N (\u03b3) [cm\u22123 ] is calculated solving the continuity equation where particle injection, radiative cooling and pair production (via the \u03b3\u2013\n\u03b3 \u2192 e\u00b1 process), are taken into account. The created pairs\ncontribute to the emission. The injection function Q(\u03b3)\n[cm\u22123 s\u22121 ] is assumed to be a smoothly joining broken\npower\u2013law, with a slope Q(\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212s1 and \u03b3 \u2212s2 below and\nabove a break energy \u03b3b :\nQ(\u03b3) = Q0\n\n(\u03b3/\u03b3b )\u2212s1\n1 + (\u03b3/\u03b3b )\u2212s1 +s2\n\n(A1)\n\nThe total power injected into the source\nin the form of relR\nativistic electrons is Pi\u2032 = me c2 V Q(\u03b3)\u03b3d\u03b3, where V =\n(4\u03c0/3)R3 is the volume of the emitting region.\nThe injection process lasts for a light crossing time R/c,\nand we calculate N (\u03b3) at this time. This assumption comes\nfrom the fact that even if injection lasted longer, adiabatic\nlosses caused by the expansion of the source (which is traveling while emitting) and the corresponding decrease of the\nmagnetic field would make the observed flux to decrease.\nTherefore the calculated spectra correspond to the maximum of a flaring episode.\nAbove and below the accretion disk, in its inner parts,\nthere is an X\u2013ray emitting corona of luminosity LX (it is\nfixed at a level of 30% of Ld ). Its spectrum is a power law\nof energy index \u03b1X = 1 ending with a exponential cut at\nEc =150 keV. The specific energy density (i.e. as a function\nof frequency) of the disk and the corona are calculated in the\ncomoving frame of the emitting blob, and used to properly\ncalculate the resulting External inverse Compton spectrum.\nThe BLR is assumed to be a thin spherical shell, of radius\n1/2\nRBLR = 1017 Ld,45 cm. We consider also the presence of a\nIR torus, at larger distances. The internally produced synchrotron emission is used to calculate the synchrotron self\nCompton (SSC) flux. Table 5 lists the adopted parameters.\nTable 6 lists the power carried by the jet in the form of\nradiation (Pr ), magnetic field (PB ), emitting electrons (Pe ,\nno cold electron component is assumed) and cold protons\n(Pp , assuming one proton per emitting electron). All the\npowers are calculated as\nPi = \u03c0R2 \u03932 \u03b2c Ui\u2032\nUi\u2032\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere\nis the energy density of the i component, as measured in the comoving frame.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n13\n\nThe power carried in the form of the produced ra\u2032\ndiation, Pr = \u03c0R2 \u03932 \u03b2c Urad\n, can be re\u2013written as [using\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\nUrad = L /(4\u03c0R c)]:\nPr = L\u2032\n\n\u03932\n\u03932\n1\n= L 4 \u223c L 2\n4\n4\u03b4\n4\u03b4\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere L is the total observed non\u2013thermal luminosity (L\u2032\n\u2032\nis in the comoving frame) and Urad\nis the radiation energy\ndensity produced by the jet (i.e. excluding the external components). The last equality assumes \u03b8v \u223c 1/\u0393.\nWhen calculating Pe (the jet power in bulk motion of\nemitting electrons) we include their average energy, i.e. Ue\u2032 =\nne h\u03b3ime c2 .\n\nREFERENCES\nAbazajian K.
