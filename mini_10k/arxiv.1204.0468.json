In particular we will\nrefer to the compelling scenario where the Higgs is a bound state of a strongly interacting\ndynamics at the TeV scale [2]. It could be as light as 125 GeV, for example, if it is also\nthe pseudo-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously-broken global symmetry of the strong sector [3, 4].\nSuch scenario generally predicts strong coupling between the Higgs and the new heavy\nfermions emerging from the strong sector. The contribution to the composite Higgs production given by the decays of the heavy fermions is thus sizable. Analyses focused on this\ntype of channels can represent a very effective test of the composite nature of the Higgs,\nwhich could be revealed already at the early stage of the LHC. The composite nature of the\nHiggs boson can be properly analyzed from the strong scattering of Higgs and longitudinal\ngauge bosons. This requires, however, a much\n\u221a larger amount of integrated luminosity to be\n\u22121\ncollected at the LHC, about 300 fb with s = 14 TeV [9]. Present searches for the Higgs\nboson in the \"standard\" channels have begun to constraint small portions of the parameter\nspace of composite Higgs models [10]; they are not yet sensitive, however, to decay channels\nas h \u2192 bb\u0304. \"Alternative\" channels, as the one we are proceeding to analyze, could improve\nthe LHC sensitivity to this decay and extend the reach on the parameter space.\nThe composite Higgs production through the decays of heavy quarks has been recently analyzed in [11]. Two types of productions for the heavy fermions have been considered in this\nreport: the double production of vector-like quarks (see also [12]) and the production of a\nheavy fermion in association with its SM partner from the decay of a heavy gluon [14\u201317].\nIn this work we will consider the single production of a heavy fermion, which is mediated\nby the exchange of longitudinal electro-weak bosons [5, 6]. This type of production has been\n1\n\n\fanalyzed in [5] to study the prospects of discovering the heavy fermions, without considering\nthe Higgs production. In this paper we present a first analysis of the Higgs production mediated by the single production of a heavy fermion. As a first concrete case, we will focus our\nanalysis on the single production of a heavy bottom (B\u0303). The bottom partner can be realistically lighter than other heavy resonances and its exchange leads to a particularly promising\nfinal state with a distinctive topology. Other interesting channels, as we will highlight in\nSection 4, involve the single production of heavy top partners (a thorough analysis of these\nchannels has been recently performed in [19]). 1\nThe analysis we will perform considering the single production, as first pointed out in [5],\noffers, contrary to the other heavy-fermion-mediated production mechanisms, the possibility\nof measuring the Higgs coupling to heavy fermions, from which it could be possible to extract important informations on the theory, such as the value of the Yukawa coupling among\ncomposite states. A further advantage of this type of analysis resides in the fact that the\nsignal cross section drops slowerly than that of double production with the increasing of\nthe heavy fermion mass. Therefore, an analysis of single production is expected to be more\npowerful than an analysis of double production, in the case of heavy fermions with mass\nabove roughly 600 GeV (see also [6]). The heavy fermion production from a heavy gluon\nproves to be very powerful, with the possibility for a discovery at the early LHC run [13].\nIt has the disadvantage, however, to require the existence of a heavy gluon whose mass\nhas to be comprised in a range [\u223c m\u2217 , \u223c 2m\u2217 ], where m\u2217 denotes the mass of the heavy\nfermion, and to depend on several other parameters of the model, such as the top degree of\ncompositeness [14, 17]. The analysis we will perform, on the contrary, depends on just two\nparameters (in addition to the Higgs mass and branching ratios), the heavy-bottom mass\nand its coupling to the Higgs and electro-weak gauge bosons; it could be thus also easily\ngeneralized to other scenarios.\nTop partners which can be singly-produced by electroweak interactions also appear, for example, in Little Higgs models [20]. Analyses of single production in the context of Little\nHiggs theories can be found in [21].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the effective two-site model\nthat we adopt to study the phenomenology and we define the lagrangian which is relevant for\nour analysis. We derive the heavy bottom production cross section and the relevant decay\nrates. In Section 3 we study the prospects of observing B\u0303 \u2192 hb events at the LHC. We\nperform a Montecarlo simulation of the signal and the main SM backgrounds and outline a\nstrategy to maximize the discovery significance. We discuss the results obtained and draw\nour conclusions in Section 4. Finally, more details on the effective model and the expressions\nfor the Higgs coupling to the different heavy fermions can be found in Appendix A.\n1\nSuch analysis could give interesting informations on the theory, especially once results were compared\nwith those from the B\u0303 channel (see the discussion in Sec. 4 ).\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nA two-site effective theory for composite Higgs models\n\nAt energies below the compositeness scale, assumed to be of several TeV, composite operators\nexcite from the vacuum a tower of infinite resonances; we will work in the framework of\nan effective theory that includes only the lowest-lying resonances and reproduces the lowenergy limit of a large set of composite Higgs models and warped extra-dimensional theories\nwith a custodial symmetry in the bulk [25]. Specifically, we will adopt a \"two-site\" (TS)\ndescription [8], where two sectors, the weakly-coupled sector of the elementary fields and\nthe composite sector, that comprises the Higgs, are linearly coupled each other through\nmass mixing terms [26]. This leads to a scenario of partial compositeness of the SM; after\ndiagonalization the elementary/composite basis rotates to the mass eigenstate one, made up\nof SM and heavy states that are admixture of elementary and composite modes. Heavier\nparticles have larger degrees of compositeness: heavy SM particles, like the top, are more\ncomposite while the light ones are almost elementary.\n\n2.1\n\nThe model\n\nWe adopt the same two-site TS10 model introduced in ref. [17]. More details on the model\ncan be found in [18]. The two building blocks of the model are the elementary sector and\nthe composite sector. The composite sector has a SU (3)c \u00d7 SO(4) \u00d7 U (1)X global symmetry,\nwith SO(4) \u223c SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R . The particle content of the elementary sector is that of\nthe SM without the Higgs, and the SU (3)c \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y elementary fields gauge the\ncorresponding global invariance of the strong dynamics, with Y = TR3 + X.

We use an economical\nnotation where symbols denoting elementary (composite) fields before the rotation now indicate the SM (heavy) fields.\nAfter the EWSB, the SM top and bottom quarks acquire a mass, and the heavy masses in\neqs.(8) get corrections of order (vY\u2217 /MQ\u2217 )2 . In the following, we assume r \u2261 (vY\u2217 /MQ\u2217 ) \u001c 1\nand compute all quantities at leading order in r. We have the following expressions for the\ntop and bottom masses:\nv\nv\nmt = Y\u2217 s1 sR , mb = \u221a Y\u2217 s1 sbR .\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nsbR is forced to be very small, sbR ' 0 (cbR ' 1), in order for the model to reproduce the\nsmall ratio mb /mt (mb /mt \u223c sbR /sR ).\nIn the case of a right-handed top with a large degree of compositeness, sR ' 1 (cR \u001c 1),\nwe see from eq. (8) that heavy fermions in the Q\u030302/3 triplet as well the T\u03035/3 and the B\u0303\nbecome much lighter than other fermionic resonances, mT\u0303 cR \u001c mT\u0303 . The same happens for\nT5/3 and T2/3 in the case of a composite left-handed top, s1 ' 1 (c1 \u001c 1) . The appearance of\nrelatively light resonances is tightly connected to the presence of the custodial symmetry in\nthe composite sector; indeed, composite fermions which exhibit this behavior are generally\nknown as custodians [22\u201324]. In this analysis we will focus on the custodian B\u0303. Indirect\nbounds on the B\u0303 mass from flavor observables and electroweak precision tests are model\ndependent. A specific study of \u2206F = 1 constraints on the TS10 model considered in this\nanalysis is presented in [18]. In general, mass values roughly below 500 GeV are allowed for\nthis custodian heavy bottom (see also Ref. [27]). Moreover, also lighter B\u0303 could be easily\naccomodated if one considers particular assumptions on the flavor structure of the new\nstrong sector, like minimal flavor violation or CP invariance [28]. Mass values mB\u0303 . 500\nGeV are thus realistic in composite models of the type considered here and still allowed by\nexperimental constraints. Present searches for heavy vector-like quarks at the LHC [29] put\na still mild constraint, mB\u0303 & 420 GeV, on the B\u0303 mass. 2\n\n2.2\n\nB\u0303 single-production and decays\n\nThe interactions beyond the SM which are relevant for our analysis of the B\u0303 single production\nand subsequent decay into a composite Higgs can be restricted to the following terms:\n1 \b\nTr \u2202\u03bc H\u2020 \u2202 \u03bc H \u2212 V (H\u2020 H)\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212 Y\u2217 s1 cbR b\u0304L \u03c60 B\u0303R + t\u0304L \u03c6+ B\u0303R + h.c.\n\n \u0304 (i 6 \u2202 \u2212 m ) B\u0303 +\nLB\u0303,h =B\u0303\nB\u0303\n\n2\n\n(10)\n\nRef. [29] presents a search for pair production of heavy bottoms which decay predominantly as B\u0303 \u2192 W t.\nWe derive the limit mB\u0303 & 420 GeV from [29], considering a value BR(B\u0303 \u2192 W t) = 0.5 instead of BR(B\u0303 \u2192\nW t) = 1.\n\n5\n\n\fThe B\u0303 branching ratios (BR) are essentially fixed by the equivalence theorem to be\nBR(B\u0303 \u2192 WL t) ' 0.50, BR(B\u0303 \u2192 ZL b) ' BR(B\u0303 \u2192 hb) ' 0.25. The rate for the B\u0303 decays\ncan be found in Appendix A.1. They depend quadratically on the vertex\n\u03bb = Y\u2217 s1 cbR ' Y\u2217 s1 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich can be directly read from the lagrangian (10). We remind that Y\u2217 represents the\nYukawa coupling among composite states (see eq. (5)). The last equality in eq. (11) comes\nfrom the fact that sbR ' 0 (cbR ' 1), to reproduce the small ratio mb /mt . The \u03bb coupling of\nthe heavy bottom B\u0303 with the electro-weak bosons and the SM quarks affects both the decay\nand the single-production of the B\u0303. The single production is described by the diagram in\nFigure 1(a), where the intermediate exchange of a WL (ZL /h) mediates the production of\na B\u0303 in association with a top (bottom) and a light quark. In particular, we will focus on\nthe final state B\u0303t + jets, where the B\u0303 subsequently decays into a Higgs plus a bottom and\nthe top decays leptonically. We also consider the decay of the Higgs into a bb\u0304 pair, with the\nsame BR of that of a SM Higgs of 125 GeV.\nDespite we are referring to a specific composite Higgs model, our analysis could be easily\nextended to other scenarios, considering that it depends on just two parameters (once we fix\nthe Higgs mass and the h \u2192 bb\u0304 branching ratio):\nmB\u0303 .\n\n\u03bb,\n\n(12)\n\nAt the end we will analyze the LHC sensitivity on the (B\u0303 \u2192 hb)t + jets channel in the\n(mB\u0303 , \u03bb) parameter space. We now fix \u03bb = 3 and we consider several B\u0303 mass values. In the\nspecific case of TS10, \u03bb = 3 could be realized, for example, if we have a Yukawa coupling\nY\u2217 \u223c 3 (which is a reference value generally considered in composite Higgs models) and a\nleft-handed top with a large degree of compositeness, s1 \u223c 1.\nThe precise value for the B\u0303 BRs and width can be derived from Fig. 7 in Appendix A; in\nthe range of mass we will consider and for the reference value \u03bb = 3 we have\nBR(B\u0303 \u2192 hb) ' 0.26\n\n\u0393(B\u0303)/mB\u0303 ' 0.16\n\n(13)\n\n\u221a Fig. 1(b) shows\u221athe cross section for the B\u0303t + X + c.c. single production at the LHC with\ns = 14 TeV and s = 8 TeV, as a function of the B\u0303 mass. In Fig. 1(b) we consider both\nthe B\u0303 charges. Notice that, due to the different content of the up and down partons in the\n \u0304 is roughly 2 times that for B\u0303. We\nproton, the cross section for the single-production of B\u0303\n \u0304\nfind \u03c3(B\u0303)/\u03c3(\nB\u0303) ' 2 at 14 TeV LHC and ' 2.4 at 8 TeV LHC (these numbers slightly grow\nup with the increasing of the B\u0303 mass). In our analysis we will exploit mainly kinematic cuts\nand we will not make use of this charge asymmetry. Anyway it could represent a promising\nvariable to discriminate between signal and background, especially at 8 TeV.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn this section we discuss the prospects of observing the composite Higgs production in the\nchannel pp \u2192 (B\u0303 \u2192 (h \u2192 bb)b)t + X at the LHC.

We set the \u03bb coupling to the reference\nvalue \u03bb = 3; cross sections scale with \u03bb as \u03bb2 .\n\nFigure 1: B\u0303 single production.\nWe will present a simple parton-level analysis\n\u221a aimed at assessing the LHC discovery reach.\nWe consider two \u221a\ncenter-of-mass energies: s = 8 TeV, the energy of the current phase of\ndata taking, and s = 14 TeV, the design energy that will be reached in the second phase\nof operation of the LHC. Our selection strategy and the set of kinematic cuts that we will\ndesign do not depend, however, on the value of the collider energy. This is because they will\nbe optimized to exploit the peculiar kinematics of the signal, and a change in the collider\nenergy mainly implies a rescaling of the production cross sections of signal and background\nvia the parton luminosities, without affecting the kinematic distributions.\n\n3.1\n\nMontecarlo simulation of signal and background\n\nWe simulate the signal by using MadGraph v4 [30], after implementing the TS10 model with\nFeynrules [31], while for the background we make use of both MadGraph and ALPGEN [32]. 3\nIn our parton-level analysis jets are identified with the quarks and gluons from the hard\nscattering. If two quarks or gluons are closer than the separation \u2206R = 0.4, they are\nmerged into a single jet whose four-momentum is the vectorial sum of the original momenta.\nWe require that the jets and the leptons satisfy the following set of acceptance and isolation\n3\n\nThe factorization\nscales have been set to be equal and chosen as follows: Q = mB\u0303 /4\nq and renormalization\np\nP 2\n2\nfor the signal; Q = mW + j pT j for W W bb + jets; Q = m2W + p2T W for W bb + jets and W + jets.\n\n7\n\n\fmB\u0303\n\n5j\n\n0.4 TeV\n0.6 TeV\n0.8 TeV\n1.0 TeV\n1.2 TeV\n\n0.53\n0.56\n0.57\n0.57\n0.55\n\n4j (3j + 1M j)\n0.38\n0.37\n0.36\n0.36\n0.37\n\n(13%)\n(13%)\n(16%)\n(19%)\n(26%)\n\n3j\n0.08\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.08\n\nTable 1: Fraction of signal events where the jet content is reconstructed to be respectively 5j\n(where j denotes either a light jet or a b-jet), 4j and 3j, for different values of the B\u0303 mass and\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV.

Moreover,\nthe missing energy\n6 T of each eventPhas been computed by including a Gaussian resolution\npP E\ni\ni\n\u03c3(6ET ) = a *\ni ET is the scalar sum of the transverse energies of all\ni ET /GeV, where\nthe reconstructed objects (electrons, muons and jets). We choose a = 0.49. 4\nTable 1 shows the fraction of signal events where the jet content is reconstructed to be\nrespectively 5j (where\n\u221a j denotes either a light jet or a b-jet), 4j and\n\u221a 3j, for different values of\nthe B\u0303 mass and for s = 14 TeV (very similar numbers hold for s = 8 TeV). The numbers\nin parenthesis in the 4j column represent the percentage of the events, among those with\nfour jets, where the bb\u0304 pair from the Higgs merges into a single fat jet (which we denote as\nM j).\nThe events with 4j are mainly constituted by events where one jet is soft, with pT < 30\nGeV. Events where one jet is a merged jet increase with larger masses, because the Higgs is\nmore boosted in this case, but the percentage is not so relevant; sophisticated technique of\ntagging boosted object could not be useful in this case. Tab. 1 shows that the fraction of\nevents with four jets is not negligible. For this reason in our analysis we will select events\nwith at least four jets and exactly one lepton. We further require the b-tagging of at least\ntwo b-jets.\npp \u2192 l\u00b1 + n jets + E\n6 T,\n\nn \u2265 4,\n\nAt least 2 b-tag\n\n(16)\n\nwhere all objects must satisfy the acceptance and isolation cuts of eq.(15).\n4\n\nThis numerical value, as well as the b-tagging efficiency and rejection rate and the resolution parameters\nconsidered in the jet smearing, have been chosen according to the performance of the ATLAS detector [33].\n\n8\n\n\fThe largest SM background after the event selection of eq.(16) is the irreducible background W W bb + jets, which includes the resonant sub-processes W tb + jets (single top) and\ntt\u0304 + jets. The latter, in particular, gives the largest contribution. Other backgrounds which\nwill turn out to be relevant after imposing our full set of kinematic cuts are W bb + jets and\nW + jets, where at least two of the light jets are mistagged as b-jets .\nFor each event of the samples with b quarks (with only light jets), we estimate, taking into\naccount a binomial distribution, the efficiency \u03b5AL2b (\u03b6AL2b ) of tagging at least two b-jets as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u0012 nb \u0013\nnj\nk\nnb \u2212k\n\u03b5AL2b =\n(\u000fb ) (1 \u2212 \u000fb )\n,\n\u03b6AL2b =\n\u03b6b2 ,\n(17)\nk\n2\n2\u2264k\u2264nb\n\nwhere \u03b5b = 0.6 is the efficiency of the b-tag and \u03b6b = 0.01 is the probability of mistagging a\nlight jet as a b-jet. nb is the number of b quarks with |\u03b7b | < 2.5, nj is the number of light\njet with |\u03b7j | < 2.5. We found efficiencies of about 0.81 for the signal events (which have\ntypically four central b quarks), of about 0.35 for the W W bb + jets and the W bb + jets\nbackground (with typically two central b quarks) and of about 4 * 10\u22124 for the W + jets\nbackground.\nWe have simulated the W W bb events by using MadGraph, while the other backgrounds\nare generated with ALPGEN. For simplicity, in our analysis we include all the samples with\nincreasing multiplicity of light jets in the final state. This is a redundant procedure which\ncould lead to a double counting of kinematic configurations. A correct procedure would be\nresumming soft and collinear emissions by means of a parton shower, and adopting some\nmatching technique to avoid double counting. However, retaining all the W +n jets samples,\nwe expect to obtain a conservative estimate of the background. Moreover some of the cuts\nwe will impose tend to suppress the events with larger number of jets and thus to reduce\nthe amount of double counting.\n\n3.2\n\nReconstruction of the heavy bottom and of the Higgs resonances\n\nWe are focusing our analysis on the channel pp \u2192 (B\u0303 \u2192 (h \u2192 bb)b)t + X. The physical final\nstate is that in eq. (16).\nWe have n \u2265 4 jets in the final state; two of these jets should not come from B\u0303, one is\nthe b-jet from the top decay, the other is the light jet from the initial parton that emits the\nintermediate W . In order to reconstruct the B\u0303 resonance, we need to tag these two jets and\ndiscard them from the possible constituents of the heavy-bottom resonance.\nAt a first step we tag the top and its decay products. The procedure we adopt requires\nthe reconstruction of the momentum of the neutrino. The transverse momentum of the\nneutrino can be reconstructed from the transverse missing momentum;\nthis\nP\nP latter can be\nestimated, considering a pTT OT = 0 hypothesis, as pmiss\n=\n\u2212\np\n,\nwhere\npT is the sum\nT\nT\nover the pT of all the detected final states. Once we have estimated the neutrino transverse\nmomentum, we can derive the neutrino longitudinal momentum, pz , by requiring that the\nneutrino and the lepton reconstruct an on-mass-shell W , Ml\u03bd = 80.4 GeV. The condition\n2\n(E l + E \u03bd )2 \u2212 (plx + p\u03bdx )2 \u2212 (ply + p\u03bdy )2 \u2212 (plz + p\u03bdz )2 = MW\n\n9\n\n(18)\n\n\fgives two solutions for p\u03bdz . We find that in the ' 20% of the events, both for the signal\nand the background, the eq. (18) has imaginary solutions (this corresponds to the case of a\nquite off-shell leptonically decayed W ). In this case we decide to throw out the event. Our\nneutrino reconstruction procedure has, therefore, an efficiency of about the 80%. Once we\nhave reconstructed the momentum of the neutrino, we want to reconstruct the top which is\nin our signal and, in particular, to tag the jet associated to its decay. To do this, we first\nreconstruct the leptonically decayed W and then we consider all the possible W j combinations. In each event we have two W \u2192 l\u03bd candidates, one for each of the two solutions of\nthe neutrino longitudinal momentum, eq.(18). The W j pair that gives the MW j invariant\nmass closest to the top mass, mt = 174 GeV, is selected as the pair coming from the decay\nof the top. Notice that this procedure allows, as a bonus, to fully reconstruct the neutrino.\nThe top 4-momentum is then reconstructed by summing on the 4-momentum of the W and\nof the j that form the selected pair. At this stage of the analysis, we do not want yet to\ndistinguish between the signal and the background. Our aim is to recognize the top we know\nto be in the signal. Therefore, we choose to keep all the events in a Mtop wide range, [150\nGeV, 230 GeV], in order to catch the most part of the signal events.\nWe thus proceed to tag the light jet from the parton that emits the intermediate W . We\ncan do this by considering that this jet tends to be emitted at very high rapidity. As also\ndiscussed in [5] and first found in [7], the intermediate W tends to carry only a small fraction of the initial parton energy, in order to maximize its propagator. At the same time, it\nmust have enough energy to produce the heavy bottom. Thus, the quark in the final state\nthat originates from the parton emitting the W has a high energy and a small transverse\nmomentum (we find a ratio of about ten between the quark energy and the quark transverse\nmomentum). This results in a final light jet with high rapidity, |\u03b7| & 2.5. This is a peculiarity of the topology of the signal that we exploit to reconstruct the B\u0303 resonance and that we\nwill also further exploit to discriminate between the signal and the background. We check\nfrom the Montecarlo simulation that the light jet in the signal represents the jet (not coming\nfrom the top) with the highest rapidity in about the 80 \u2212 90% of the cases, the fraction is\n0.80 for mB\u0303 = 0.4 TeV and grows up to 0.89 for a B\u0303 of 1.2 TeV. We thus tag the light-jet, by\nassuming that it coincides with the jet (not coming from the top) with the highest rapidity.\nThe heavy-bottom is finally reconstructed by summing on the 4-momentum of all the jets\nin the final state except the jet coming from the reconstructed top and the tagged light-jet.\nThe Higgs can be reconstructed by considering that it is produced from the decay of the B\u0303\nin association with a bottom. This latter can be distinguished from the jets produced from\nthe Higgs decay, by the fact that it tends to be more energetic than the other jets, being it\ndirectly produced from the decay of the heavy fermion. Therefore, we reconstruct the Higgs\nby summing on the 4-momentum of all the jets from the heavy-bottom, with the exception\nof the most energetic jet among them.\nThe reconstruction of the B\u0303 and Higgs resonance is crucial for the discovery of such particles and to obtain an estimate value of their masses. The reconstruction of the intermediate\nfinal state B\u0303tj (see Figure 1(a)) is also very useful to design a strategy for the reduction of\nthe background.\n\n10\n\n\fLHC 8 TeV\n\nLHC 14 TeV\n\nacceptance\n\n\u03bd+top reco\n\nacceptance\n\n\u03bd+top reco\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 0.4 TeV\n\n30.8\n\n24.3\n\n235\n\n136\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 0.6 TeV\n\n4.42\n\n3.43\n\n37.2\n\n23.7\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 0.8 TeV\n\n1.01\n\n0.773\n\n9.63\n\n6.46\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 1.0 TeV\n\n3.11\n\n2.18\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 1.2 TeV\n\n1.14\n\n0.850\n\nW W bb\n\n3510\n\n2840\n\n16700\n\n13100\n\nW W bbj\n\n2160\n\n1730\n\n10600\n\n8510\n\nW W bbjj\n\n800\n\n633\n\n4640\n\n3560\n\nW bbjj\n\n137\n\n93.0\n\n573\n\n375\n\nW bb3j\n\n52.9\n\n36.2\n\n324\n\n213\n\nW 4j\n\n11.2\n\n7.61\n\n38.4\n\n25.0\n\nW 5j\n\n4.42\n\n3.05\n\n18.7\n\n12.3\n\nTotal\nbackground\n\n6680\n\n5350\n\n33000\n\n25800\n\nTable 2:\n\nCross sections, in fb, for the signal (with \u03bb = 3) and the main backgrounds after the\nselection (16) based on the acceptance cuts of eq.(15) and the b-tag efficiencies of (17) and after\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthe reconstruction of the neutrino and of the top quark, for s = 8 TeV and s = 14 TeV.\n\n3.3\n\nEvent selection\n\nIn Table 2 we report the value of the cross section for the signal and the main SM backgrounds\nafter the selection (16) based on the acceptance and isolation cuts of eq.(15)\n\u221a and the b-tag\ns = 8 TeV and\nefficiencies\nof\n(17)\nand\nafter\nthe\nneutrino\nand\ntop\nreconstruction,\nfor\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV.\nOne can see that at this stage the background dominates by far over the signal. We can\nhowever exploit the peculiar kinematics of the signal to perform a set of cuts that reduce the\nbackground to a much smaller level. One of the peculiarities of the signal is the presence of\nthe heavy fermionic resonance among the intermediate final states. Its production requires\nthe exchange of a large amount of energy and leads to very energetic final states. We find\nvery effective applying a cut on the invariant mass of all the B\u0303tj particles in the intermediate\nfinal state as well a cut on the transverse momentum of the jet with the highest transverse\nmomentum, among the final jets that do not come from the top. We will also apply a cut\non the pT of the second hardest jet (not coming from the top) and on the pT of the top. The\nother important characteristic of the signal topology, as already discussed, is the presence of\na final jet at very high rapidity. We exploit this feature imposing a cut on the rapidity of the\n11\n\n\fmost forward jet. Further conditions are imposed on the Higgs, which is slightly boosted,\nsince it comes from a heavy particle, and is emitted at quite low rapidity.\nWe show in Fig. 2 the pT distributions of the hardest (j(1)) and of the second hardest (j(2))\njet, not coming from the top, the pT distribution of the top and the Mtot invariant mass of\nthe system B\u0303tj, where the B\u0303, the top and the light-jet are the objects in the intermediate\nfinal state, which we have reconstructed following the procedure explained in Sec. 3.2 . In\nFig. 3 we show the |\u03b7| distribution of the jet with the highest rapidity (j(HR)), in Fig. 4\nwe report the distribution of the Lorentz factor of the reconstructed Higgs and of the Higgs\nrapidity. We show the distributions (normalized to unit area) for the total background and\nfor the signal referred to different B\u0303 mass values.\nAs expected, the signal from highest B\u0303 mass values has ever more energetic final particles;\nespecially the distributions on pT j(1) and on Mtot shift on larger values with the increasing\nof mB\u0303 . We find a set of optimized cuts that minimizes the integrated luminosity needed for\na 5\u03c3 discovery of the signal with mB\u0303 = 400 GeV. In the cases of higher B\u0303 masses we will\nrefine in a second step the cuts on Mtot and on pT j(1). We define the discovery luminosity to\nbe the integrated luminosity for which a goodness-of-fit test of the SM-only hypothesis with\nPoisson distribution gives a p-value = 2.85 \u00d7 10\u22127 , which corresponds to a 5\u03c3 significance in\nthe limit of a gaussian distribution.\nThese optimized cuts are:\npT j(1) > 170 GeV pT j(2) > 100 GeV\n\npT top > 100 GeV Mtot > 1.2 TeV\n\n|\u03b7j(HR) | > 2.5\n\npT j(HR) > 30 GeV\n\n\u03b3(h) > 1.4\n\n|\u03b7h | < 1.8\n\n(19)\nMh\u2212j < 70 GeV.\n\nThe cut pT j(HR) > 30 GeV is imposed in order to avoid possible conflicts with the jets\nfrom initial state radiation5 ; Mh\u2212j represents the invariant mass of the objects which form\nthe reconstructed Higgs, from which the most energetic jet (among them) is subtracted. The\ncut on Mh\u2212j reduces particularly the backgrounds with more than 5 jets in the final state.\nThe cross sections for the signal and the main backgrounds after the optimized cuts of eq.\n(19) are reported in the column of Table 3 labelled as opt. The left plot in Fig. 5 shows, after\nthe optimized cuts, the contour plot of the invariant mass of the objects selected (with the\nprocedure explained in Sec. 3.2) as the Higgs decay products, Mh , versus the invariant mass\nof the selected B\u0303 decay\n\u221a products, MB\u0303 , for the total background plus the signal at different\nB\u0303 mass values, at s = 8 TeV. After the optimized cuts the background is substantially\nreduced. The residual background is mainly formed by W W bb + jets events. We see, indeed,\nthat the most part of the events is distributed on a region around (mt , mW ) in the contour\nplot (MB\u0303 , Mh ) of Fig. 5 (left plot). The reconstruction we do tend to select, in the case\nof the W W bb + jets background (which is made for the most part by tt\u0304 + jets events) a\ntop instead of a B\u0303 and the W coming from this top instead of the Higgs. We see from the\nright plot on Fig. 5 that, after cutting away the (mt , mW ) region (we impose MB\u0303 > 230\n5\n\nWe checked that this cut can be also enhanced to 40 GeV without changing significantly the results.\n\n12\n\n\fLHC 8 TeV\n\nLHC 14 TeV\n\nopt\n\nopt+\n\nopt\n\nopt+\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 0.4 TeV\n\n1.7\n\n1.5\n\n14\n\n13\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 0.6 TeV\n\n0.56\n\n0.52\n\n5.1\n\n4.7\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 0.8 TeV\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n1.8\n\n1.7\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 1.0 TeV\n\n0.67\n\n0.64\n\nSignal mB\u0303 = 1.2 TeV\n\n0.28\n\n0.27\n\nW W bb + jets\n\n5.2\n\n1.1\n\n58\n\n11\n\nW bb + jets\n\n0.44\n\n0.24\n\n7.8\n\n2.9\n\nW + jets\n\n0.045\n\n0.025\n\n0.46\n\n0.21\n\nTotal\nbackground\n\n5.7\n\n1.4\n\n66\n\n14\n\nTable 3:\n\nCross sections, in fb, for the signal (with \u03bb = 3) and the main backgrounds after the\noptimized cuts of eq. 19 (opt) and after the further cuts: MB\u0303 > 230 GeV and Mh > 100 GeV\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(opt+), for s = 8 TeV and s = 14 TeV.\n\nGeV and Mh > 100 GeV) the background is strongly reduced and we can clearly distinguish\nthe excess of events in correspondence of the heavy-bottom and of the Higgs resonances.\nThe cross sections for the signal and the background after the optimized cuts plus the cuts\nMB\u0303 > 230 GeV and Mh > 100 GeV are shown in the opt+ column of Table 3.\nOnce we can recognize the heavy-bottom and the Higgs resonances we can also refine the\nanalysis by imposing a cut on MB\u0303 and on Mh . We require Mh to be comprised in the region\na region of \u00b1\u0393(B\u0303)\n[100 GeV, 150 GeV] and MB\u0303 to be in \u221a\n\u221a from the B\u0303 mass value; for B\u0303 masses\nabove 1 TeV (0.8 TeV) in the case s = 14 TeV ( s = 8 TeV) we impose a cut on MB\u0303\nof \u00b12\u0393(B\u0303) from its central value. Indeed, for higher B\u0303 masses the background is already\nstrongly reduced by a milder restriction on MB\u0303 . We also refine the cut on Mtot and on the\npT of the hardest jet according to the values shown on Table 4.\nThe final cross sections for the signal and the main backgrounds, after imposing the\noptimized cuts of\n\u221a eq.(19) plus the\u221arefined cuts of Table 4, are reported in Table 5 and 6\nrespectively for s = 8 TeV and s = 14 TeV.

We can generalize our results to different \u03bb values, by simply\nconsidering that the production cross section scales with \u03bb2 . B\u0303 BRs do not depend on \u03bb\nand, a part from the production cross section, the only residual dependence of our results\non \u03bb is in the B\u0303 total decay width, which depends on \u03bb quadratically. It is thus possible\nto estimate how the LHC discovery reach varies with \u03bb by simply rescaling the numbers in\nTables 5, 6 to take into account the change in the production cross section.\nThe result is reported in Fig. 6. The two\u221a\nplots show the region in the plane (mB\u0303 , \u03bb) where\na 5\u03c3 discovery is possible\nfor the LHC at s = 8 TeV with L = 30 fb\u22121 and L = 15 fb\u22121\n\u221a\n(upper plot), and at s = 14 TeV with L = 100 fb\u22121 (lower plot).\nWe did not take into account the variation with \u03bb of the B\u0303 total decay width. In the\nregion with \u03bb > 3 this latter is larger than the values considered in the analysis. In such\nregion, however, the significance goes down to values below 5\u03c3 only in correspondence of the\nhighest B\u0303 masses, for which we applied a quite mild cut, of \u00b12\u0393(B\u0303), on the invariant mass\nMB\u0303 . We thus believe that Fig. 6 traces a conservative picture of the LHC reach.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur results are summarized by Fig. 6. They show that, for a reference value \u03bb = 3 of the\nHiggs coupling to a heavy bottom B\u0303, the 8 TeV LHC with 30 fb\u22121 can discover a Higgs\nfrom a singly-produced heavy bottom if this latter has a mass mB\u0303 . 530 GeV (while an\nobservation is possible for mB\u0303 . 650 GeV). These values for the B\u0303 mass are realistic, for\nexample, in the case of a right-handed top with a large degree of compositeness. A possible\ncomposite nature of the Higgs could be thus revealed in the (B\u0303 \u2192 (h \u2192 bb)b)t + X channel\n18\n\n\fs = 8 TeV\n5\n5\u03a3 30 fb-1\n4\n\n3\u03a3 30 fb-1\n\n15 fb-1\n-1\n\n30 fb\n\n5\u03a3 15 fb-1\n\n\u039b\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nmB\u008e HGeVL\n\ns = 14 TeV\n\nL = 100 fb-1\n\n5\n5\u03a3\n4\n\n3\u03a3\n\n\u039b\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nmB\u008e HGeVL\n\nFigure 6:\n\nLHC discovery reach in the plane (mB\u0303 , \u03bb).

In the case of a custodian heavy bottom\nas light as ' 500 GeV, the 14 TeV LHC is sensitive to the measure of the \u03bb coupling in\nbasically the full range \u03bb > 1 predicted by the theory.\nThe single production of a heavy fermion is thus a very promising channel to observe the\nHiggs and to test its possible composite nature. The B\u0303t + X, in particular, proves to\nbe an interesting channel also for the discovery of the heavy bottom. Since BR(B\u0303 \u2192\nhb) ' BR(B\u0303 \u2192 Zb), results similar to those obtained in this work are expected from the\n(B\u0303 \u2192 (Z \u2192 hadrons)b)t + X channel if one adopts the strategy outlined here, with a variation in the cut on the Higgs (Z) invariant mass.\nIn this work we have studied the single production of a heavy bottom; further contributions\nto the composite Higgs production are expected from other heavy fermions. In Table 8 we\nfinally list all the channels where heavy fermions can mediate the production of a composite\nHiggs in the TS10; similar scenarios are expected in different composite Higgs models with\ncustodial symmetry. For each final state we indicate the type of mediating heavy fermion\nand the condition when this latter could be light. Comparative analyses of these channels\ncan shed light on the theory and on the EWSB mechanism; The measure of the \u03bb couplings\nof the Higgs to different heavy fermions could give the possibility of extracting the value of\nthe Yukawa coupling among composite states and the top degree of compositeness (see the\nexpressions for the \u03bb couplings in eq. (24) of the Appendix A).\n\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nI thank Roberto Contino for discussions and comments.
