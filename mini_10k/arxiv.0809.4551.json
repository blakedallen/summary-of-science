There is no a priori restriction on\neither the density or the temperature of the quantum fluid. Since, as explained in\nevery textbook on Statistical Mechanics, an ideal Bose fluid undergoes a transition\nfrom a normal fluid to one with a condensate component, one would expect that\nthe kinetic equation retains some information on how the condensate is formed\ndynamically.\nIn general, the appropriate kinetic equation is fairly complex and to analyse the\ndetails of the transition will be a difficult task. There is however one particular\ncase which has been investigated in considerable depth. It is assumed that the\nBose fluid is spatially homogeneous and the momentum distribution is isotropic.\nThe Bose particles are massive and interact only through s-wave scattering. The\ndistribution function f , as governed by the kinetic equation, depends then only on\nthe energy \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2265 0, and on time t, t \u2265 0. Based on theoretical considerations\nand numerical simulations the following scenario has been developed for the kinetics\nof the condensation process.R One\u221astarts with an initial distribution f (\u03b5, 0) = f (\u03b5)\n\u221e\nwhich has the density \u03c1 = 0 d\u03b5 \u03b5f (\u03b5). \u03c1 is assumed to be supercritical, \u03c1 > \u03c1c .\nThen the solution f (\u03b5, t) of the kinetic equation has a piece which concentrates near\n\u03b5 = 0 and nucleates the condensate at some finite time t\u2217 . More precisely,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b5f (\u03b5, t) = \u03b5freg (\u03b5, t) + n(t)\u03b4(\u03b5)\n(1.1)\nwith n(t) = 0 for t < t\u2217 and n(t) > 0 for t > t\u2217 . Here freg is a density without any\ndelta functions. In the limit t \u2192 \u221e, n(t) tends to \u03c1\u2212\u03c1c while the regular piece tends\n\u22121\nto the critical Bose-Einstein distribution (e\u03b2\u03b5\nR \u221e\u2212 1)\u221a with the inverse temperature \u03b2\ndetermined through the initial energy e = 0 d\u03b5 \u03b5\u03b5f (\u03b5). Near t\u2217 the solution has\na self-similar structure, which will be explained below.\nIn our contribution we investigate, in more detail than previous studies, the\nprecise mechanism of how the condensate is generated and annihilated (on the level\nof the Boltzmann-Nordheim kinetic equation). In particular we obtain additional\ninformation on the self-similar structure of the solution for t > t\u2217 . A numerical check\nof these predictions would help to further elucidate the kinetics of the Bose-Einstein\ntransition.\n\n2\n\nThe Boltzmann-Nordheim equation for the energy distribution\n\nWe use throughout dimensionless variables in units which minimize the number of\nprefactors. The physically correct dimensions are supplied, e.g., in [1]. Instead of\ndenoting the energy by \u03b5 it will be more convenient to use the neutral\u221ax, y, z. The\ndistribution function is denoted by f (x), f \u2265 0, with volume element xdx, x \u2265 0,\n2\n\n\f\u221a\nsince for \u03b5 = p2 /2 one has d3 p = d\u03a9p2 d|p| and p2 d|p| = 2\u03b5d\u03b5 in three dimensions.\nTo f we associate the density \u03c1 and energy e as\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c1(f ) =\ndx xf (x) , e(f ) =\n(2.1)\ndx xxf (x) .\n0\n\n0\n\nPhysically \u03c1 is the mass and e the energy per unit volume of the spatially homogeneous Bose fluid, but we stick to the more colloquial expressions.\nf (t) is governed by the kinetic equation\nd\nf (t) = C4 (f (t)) .\ndt\n\n(2.2)\n\nC4 is the collision operator which describes the scattering of two incoming to two\noutgoing particles, the 4-wave scattering in wave turbulence. For bosons, and under\nthe assumptions stated in the introduction, one obtains\n1\nC4 (f )(x) = \u221a\nx\n\nZ\n\ndydzI(x, y, z) f \u0303(x)f \u0303(w)f (y)f (z)\n\nD(x)\n\n\u0001\n\u2212f (x)f (w)f \u0303(y)f \u0303(z) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere f \u0303(x) = 1 + f (x), w = y + z \u2212 x, and the domain D(x) = {y, z|y \u2265 0, z \u2265 0, x \u2264\ny + z} for x \u2265 0. The integral kernel I results from working out the \u03b4-functions\nfor energy and momentum conservation of the full 3D collision operator, where x, w\nare the energies of the incoming and (y, z) the energies of the outgoing particles, see\n[1, 2] for details. I is defined by\n\uf8f1 \u221a\nw for y \u2264 x , z \u2264 x , 0 \u2264 w ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u221a\n\u221ax for x \u2264 y , x \u2264 z ,\nI(x, y, z) =\n(2.4)\nz for x \u2264 y , z \u2264 x ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u221a\ny for y \u2264 x , x \u2264 z .\n\nIf \u03c1(f ) < \u221e, e(f ) < \u221e and if f (t) is bounded, then one can easily work out that\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\nd\n\u03c1(f (t)) =\ndx xC4 (f (t))(x) = 0 ,\n(2.5)\ndt\n0\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\nd\ne(f (t)) =\ndx xxC4 (f (t))(x) = 0 .\n(2.6)\ndt\n0\nThus mass and energy are conserved. As we will see, if f which diverges at x = 0,\nthe conservation laws may break down.\nOn the kinetic level the entropy per unit volume is the one of a non-interacting\nBose fluid and hence given by\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\n\u221a\n(2.7)\ns(f ) =\ndx x f \u0303(x) log f \u0303(x) \u2212 f (x) log f (x) .\n0\n\n3\n\n\fFrom (2.2) it follows that\nd\ns(f (t)) = \u03c3(f (t))\ndt\nwith the entropy production\nZ\n\u03c3(f ) =\n\n0\u2264x,y,z<\u221e,x\u2264y+z\n\n(2.8)\n\ndxdydzI(x, y, z)(A \u2212 B) log(A/B) ,\n\nA = f \u0303(x)f \u0303(w)f (y)f (z) ,\n\n \u0303 .\nB = f (x)f (w)f \u0303(y)f(z)\n\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nClearly \u03c3(f ) \u2265 0.\nFor a stationary solution \u03c3(f ) = 0. Introducing \u03c8 = log(f \u0303/f ), the condition\n\u03c3(f ) = 0 is equivalent to \u03c8 being a collisional invariant, to say\n\u03c8(x) + \u03c8(y + z \u2212 x) = \u03c8(y) + \u03c8(z)\n\n(2.11)\n\nfor all x, y, z \u2265 0 such that x \u2264 y + z. (2.11) admits as only solutions the affine\nfunctions \u03c8(x) = c0 +c1 x. Together with the condition f \u2265 0 this yields as stationary\nsolutions of the Boltzmann-Nordheim equation the Bose-Einstein distributions\nf\u03b2,\u03bc (x) = (e\u03b2(x\u2212\u03bc) \u2212 1)\u22121 ,\n\n\u03b2 > 0,\u03bc \u2264 0,\n\nparametrized by the inverse temperature \u03b2 and the chemical potential \u03bc.\nAt given \u03b2 the maximal density is\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u221a \u03b2x\n\u221a\n\u22121\n\u22123/2\n\u03c1c =\ndx x(e \u2212 1) = \u03b2\n\u03c10 , \u03c10 =\ndx x(ex \u2212 1)\u22121\n0\n\n(2.12)\n\n(2.13)\n\n0\n\nand correspondingly the maximal energy is\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\nec =\ndx x(e\u03b2x \u2212 1)\u22121 x = \u03b2 \u22125/2 e0 ,\n0\n\ne0 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\n\u221a\ndx x(ex \u2212 1)\u22121 x .\n\n(2.14)\n\nHence there is the critical line\n(ec /e0 ) = (\u03c1c /\u03c10 )5/3\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich divides the (\u03c1, e) quadrant into the domain Dnor of normal fluid and the\ndomain Dcon with some fraction of condensate. If, for given initial f , (\u03c1(f ), e(f )) \u2208\nDcon , then \u03c1(f ) > \u03c1c and f (t) has no stationary solution to approach in the limit as\nt \u2192 \u221e. Based on equilibrium statistical mechanics, it is thus natural to extend the\nclass of stationary solutions to\n\u221a\nxf\u03b2,\u03bc (x) + ncon \u03b4(x) , ncon \u2265 0 ,\n(2.16)\nwith the condition that for ncon > 0 necessarily \u03bc = 0. The density of this distribution is denoted by \u03c1(\u03b2, \u03bc) = \u03c1(f\u03b2,\u03bc ) for \u03bc < 0 and by \u03c1(\u03b2, 0, ncon ) = \u03c1c + ncon for\n4\n\n\f\u03bc = 0. The condensate has zero energy. With this extension there is a one-to-one\nrelation \u03a6 between (\u03c1, e) and (\u03b2, \u03bc, ncon ).\nIf in equilibrium there is a \u03b4-function at x = 0, it seems natural to allow for\nsuch a singular contribution also in the dynamics. The precise formulation will be\nthe task of the next section. In fact, Lu [3] proves that, for any f with \u03c1(f ) < \u221e,\ne(f ) < \u221e, in the long time limit the solution f (t) converges to (2.16) with the\nparameters (\u03b2, \u03bc, ncon ) determined through the map \u03a6 from the initial data. The\nprecise statement requires some preparations and is therefore deferred to Appendix\nC.\n\n3\n\nCoupled equations for normal fluid and condensate\n\nIf there is a condensate at time t, the full distribution function is\n\u221a\n\u221a\nxftot (x, t) = xf (x, t) + n(t)\u03b4(x) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe adopt the convention that f always denotes a continuous function on R+ =\n(0, \u221e) such that \u03c1(f ) < \u221e, e(f ) < \u221e and with a possible divergence at x = 0. We\npostulate that (2.2), (2.3) remain valid when f is substituted by ftot . Inserting ftot\nin (2.3) yields products of the form f f f , \u03b4f f , \u03b4\u03b4f , \u03b4\u03b4\u03b4, f f , \u03b4f , and \u03b4\u03b4. Using the\ncontinuity of the integral kernel I, it can be shown that the contribution of products\nwith more than one \u03b4 vanishes [1, 4]. Therefore (2.2) turns into a coupled system of\nequations for f and n, apparently first derived in [5], which reads\nd\nf = C4 (f ) + nC3 (f ) ,\n(3.2)\ndt\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\nd\nn = \u2212n\ndx xC3 (f )(x) .\n(3.3)\ndt\n0\nThe collision operator C3 is familiar from 3-wave interactions. Here it arises since\none of the collision partners is at rest. Using isotropy and integrating over the\nmomentum and energy delta functions, one obtains,\nZ x\n\u0001\n2\nC3 (f )(x) = \u221a\ndy f \u0303(x)f (x \u2212 y)f (y) \u2212 f (x)f \u0303(x \u2212 y)f \u0303(y)\nx 0\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\n4\ndy f \u0303(x)f \u0303(y \u2212 x)f (y) \u2212 f (x)f (y \u2212 x)f \u0303(y) ,\n(3.4)\n+\u221a\nx x\nsee [1] for details.\nOf course, to properly justify (3.2), (3.3), one has to go back to the microscopic\nmodel of a fluid of weakly interacting bosons. One imposes an initial quasifree state,\nh*i, such that\nha(k)i = \u03b1\u03b4(k) , ha(k)a(k \u2032 )i = \u03b4(k)\u03b4(k \u2032 )\u03b12 ,\n\u0001\nha(k)\u2217 a(k \u2032 )i = \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 ) |\u03b1|2 \u03b4(k) + f (k 2 ) ,\n5\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fwhere a(k), a(k)\u2217 are the bosonic annihilation and creation operators labeled by momentum k \u2208 R3 . \u03b1 \u2208 C and |\u03b1|2 is the condensate density. The state h*i is invariant\nunder spatial translations. If the BBGKY hierarchy is quasifreely truncated at the\nsixth order, then at least formally one arrives at the coupled system (3.2), (3.3).\nC3 conserves energy, but not mass. By considering the H-Theorem as in (2.8), one\nconcludes that \u03c3(f ) = 0 is equivalent to \u03c8 = log(fe/f ) being a collisional invariant,\nin the sense that\n\u03c8(x) + \u03c8(y) = \u03c8(x + y)\n(3.6)\nfor all x, y \u2265 0. Clearly, \u03c8 must be linear. Hence the stationary solutions for C3 are\ngiven by f\u03b2,0 with \u03b2 > 0, where \u03b2 is determined by the initial energy e(f ).\nThe coupled system (3.2), (3.3) has an obvious defect. If n(0) = 0, then n(t) = 0\nfor all t, no condensate is nucleated. A second defect lies Rin the \u221a\ndefinite sign of the\n\u221e\nterm on the right hand side of (3.3). If f is bounded, then 0 dx xC3 (f )(x) \u2265 0, as\nwill be shown below. Hence, if present initially, the condensate density is monotone\ndecreasing. The derivation of (3.2), (3.3) provides no immediate indication of how\nthe condensate is generated. Only, since physically the total mass is conserved,\nthe mass lost by the normal component has to be identified with the mass of the\ncondensate.\nIn view of (2.5) valid for bounded f 's a natural guess is that the loss of mass for\n(3.2) is linked to the divergence of f at x = 0. The relevant properties are stated in\ntwo propositions, which will be proved in Appendix A.\nProposition 1. Let f be continuous on R+ , \u03c1(f ) < \u221e, e(f ) < \u221e, and let\nlim x7/6 f (x) = b,\n\nx\u21920\n\nThen\nlim\n\n\u03b4\u21920\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u03b4\n\nb \u2265 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u221a\ndx xC4 (f )(x) = \u2212\u03934 b3 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nHere \u03934 \u223c\n= 3.05 and the defining integral is provided in (A.13).\nProposition 2. Let f be continuous on R+ , \u03c1(f ) < \u221e, e(f ) < \u221e, and let\nlim xf (x) = a,\n\nx\u21920\n\nThen\nlim\n\n\u03b4\u21920\n\nHere \u03933 = \u22122\n\nR1\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u03b4\n\na \u2265 0.\n\n\u221a\ndx xC3 (f )(x) = \u2212\u03933 a2 + 2\n\ndxx\u22121 log(1 \u2212 x) = \u03c0 2 /3.\n\n(3.9)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndxxf (x) .\n\n(3.10)\n\n0\n\nRemark: In agreement with the fact that the condensate has zero energy, under the\ncondition (3.7) energy is still conserved in the sense that\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\n(3.11)\ndx xxCj (f )(x) = 0 for j = 3, 4 .\nlim\n\u03b4\u21920\n\n\u03b4\n\n6\n\n\f\u22c4\nIn (3.10) there is a loss of mass as \u03933 a and a gain given by the integral expression.\nWe interpret this as the corresponding loss/gain of the condensate. Therefore (3.2)\nand (3.3) are improved to\n2\n\nNote that for f\u03b2,0\n\nd\nf (t) = C4 (f (t)) + n(t)C3 (f (t)) ,\ndt\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\nd\n2\nn(t) = n(t) \u03933 a(t) \u2212 2\ndxxf (x, t) .\ndt\n0\none has\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\na=\u03b2 , 2\ndxxf\u03b2,0 (x) = \u03b2 \u22122 \u03933 .\n\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\n(3.14)\n\n0\n\nThus the Bose-Einstein distributions of (2.16) are indeed stationary solutions for\n(3.12), (3.13).\nIn (3.13) we did not include the term \u03934 b(t)3 , since b > 0 implies a = \u221e. Mass is\ntransferred between normal fluid and condensate only through nC3 . Thus it seems\nthat the coupled system (3.12), (3.13) still has the defect that, in case n(t) = 0, no\ncondensate can be nucleated. We will see in the next section, how this objection is\nmet.\nTentatively we assume that a solution f (t), n(t) to (3.12), (3.13) has the properties:\n(i) f (t) \u2265 0, n(t) \u2265 0 are continuous in t, \u03c1(f (t)) < \u221e, e(f (t)) < \u221e.\n(ii) f (t) : R+ \u2192 R+ is continuous and limx\u21920 xf (x, t) = a(t) exists with a(t) < \u221e.\n\n4\n\nScaling theory close to nucleation of condensate\n\nWe note that if n(t0 ) > 0 for some t0 , then n(t) > 0 for all t > t0 . Thus, if n(0) = 0,\nthere must be a first time, t\u2217 , such that n(t) = 0 for t < t\u2217 and n(t) > 0 for t > t\u2217 .\nOf course, depending on the initial f , one could have t\u2217 = \u221e. In this section we\nplan to study the solution close t\u2217 , the time of nucleation of the condensate. We\nmostly follow [6], but the post-nucleation seems to be novel.\n(i) n(0) = 0, t\u2217 < \u221e, pre-nucleation of the condensate.\nFor the scaling theory the quadratic terms of C4 can be neglected. Physically\nthis corresponds to the semiclassical approximation. Since n(t) = 0 for t < t\u2217 , we\nhave to study\nd\nf = C4,sc (f )\n(4.1)\ndt\nwith the semiclassical collision operator\nZ\n1\ndydzI(x, y, z) f (x)f (y)f (z) + f (w)f (y)f (z)\nC4,sc (f )(x) = \u221a\nx D(x)\n\u0001\n\u2212f (x)f (w)f (y) \u2212 f (x)f (w)f (z) .\n(4.2)\n7\n\n\fClose to x = 0 the scaling ansatz is\nf (x, t\u2217 \u2212 t) =\n\nx \u0001\n1\n,\n\u03c6\u2212\n\u03bd\n\u03c4 (t)\n\u03c4 (t)\n\n0 < t \u226a 1.\n\n(4.3)\n\nInserting in (4.1), (4.2) yields\n\u03c4 (t)\u2212\u03bd\u22121\n\n\u0001\nd\n\u03c4 (t) \u03bd\u03c6\u2212 (x) + x\u03c6\u2032\u2212 (x) = \u03c4 \u22123\u03bd+2 C4,sc (\u03c6\u2212 )(x) .\ndt\n\n(4.4)\n\nWe fix the time scale by setting \u03c4 2\u03bd\u22123 \u03c4\u0307 = 1. Then, for \u03bd > 1,\n\u00011/2(\u03bd\u22121)\n\u03c4 (t) = 2(\u03bd \u2212 1)t\n.\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe scaling function \u03c6\u2212 becomes then the solution of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem\nd\n\u03bd\u03c6\u2212 (x) + x \u03c6\u2212 (x) = C4,sc (\u03c6\u2212 )(x) .\n(4.6)\ndx\nFor \u03c4 \u226a x \u226a 1 the solution in (4.3) is assumed to be frozen at a definite power\nlaw. This yields the right boundary condition\n\u03c6\u2212 (x) \u223c\n= x\u2212\u03bd\n\nfor x \u2192 \u221e .\n\n(4.7)\n\nFor small x the, conventional, left boundary condition is\n\u03c6\u2212 (x) \u2192 \u03c60\n\nfor x \u2192 0 .\n\n(4.8)\n\nIn the limit x \u2192 0, (4.6) then yields, noting that the terms in C4,sc (\u03c6+ ) proportional\nto \u03c60 cancel each other,\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u03bd\u03c60 =\ndy\ndz\u03c6\u2212 (y)\u03c6\u2212 (z)\u03c6\u2212 (y + z) ,\n(4.9)\n0\n\n0\n\nwhich is consistent in the sense that both sides have the same sign.\n\u03bd and \u03c60 are free parameters. To have condensation at all, by Proposition 1\nnecessarily\n\u03bd \u2265 7/6 .\n(4.10)\nOn the other hand to have a finite mass in the interval 0 \u2264 x \u2264 \u03c4 (t) yields the upper\nbound\n\u03bd < 3/2 .\n(4.11)\nBecause of slow decay, the scaling function \u03c6\u2212 has infinite mass and energy. It would\nbe nice, if (4.6) would determine a unique value of \u03bd. But very little is known in\nthis direction.\nNumerically one finds that\n\u03bd = 1.234\n(4.12)\n8\n\n\fby fitting the power law of f (x, t\u2217 \u2212t) for x > \u03c4 , see [5, 7]. One also finds f (0, t\u2217 \u2212t) \u223c\n=\n\u2212\u03bd\n\u03c4 (t) \u03c60 consistent with the right boundary condition (4.8). We refer to [6] for\nadditional information on the eigenvalue equation (4.6).\nAt the onset of nucleation one has f (x, t\u2217 ) = x\u2212\u03bd , which is outside the space of\nsolutions. As we will argue next, for any t > t\u2217 the solution falls back into its proper\nspace.\n(ii) n(0) = 0, t\u2217 < \u221e, post-nucleation of the condensate.\nAs for t < t\u2217 we can work with the semiclassical approximation, which amounts\nto\nd\nf = C4,sc (f ) + nC3,sc (f ) ,\n(4.13)\ndt\nd\nn = n\u03933 a2 .\n(4.14)\ndt\nThe 3-wave semiclassical collision operator reads\nZ x\n2\nC3,sc (f )(x) = \u221a\ndy{f (x \u2212 y)f (y) \u2212 f (x)f (x \u2212 y) \u2212 f (x)f (y)}\nx 0\nZ \u221e\n4\ndy{f (x)f (y) + f (y)f (y \u2212 x) \u2212 f (x)f (y \u2212 x)} .

On the other hand a general \u03bde is of interest, since one can set t\u2217 = 0 and\nimpose by hand some power law for the intial distribution, i.e. one sets\nwith a cutoff function h so to have bounded \u03c1(f ), e(f ).

We conclude that the scaling\nfunction \u03c6+ satisfies\n\u2212 K1 (e\n\u03bd \u03c6+ + x\u03c6\u2032+ ) = C4,sc (\u03c6+ ) + K2 C3,sc (\u03c6+ )\n\n(4.28)\n\nwith the boundary conditions (4.17) and (4.23) and the two positive constants\nK1 = a20 T3 ( 32 \u2212 \u03bde)\u22121 ,\n\n1 \u03b3 \u0001\u03b3\n.\na20 t0 \u03933\n\nK2 =\n\n(4.29)\n\na0 and t0 are free parameters.\nThere is one important consistency check. In (4.28) we take the limit x \u2192 0.\nThe left hand side behaves as \u2212K1 a0 (e\n\u03bd \u2212 1)/x. For C4,sc we use, see Appendix A,\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u0001\u22121\n3\nlim xC4,sc (\u03c6+ )(x) = (a0 ) \u03934,1 , \u03934,1 =\ndy\ndz (y + z \u2212 1)yz\n. (4.30)\nx\u21920\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNumerically \u03934,1 = 1.645. Clearly, one cannot balance the negative \u2212K1 a0 (e\n\u03bd \u2212 1).\nTherefore, C3,sc must come into play. For small arguments the leading terms in the\nintegrand of C3,sc cancel and, to achieve the 1/x singularity, we have to assume the\nsubleading behavior\n\u03c6+ (x)\u22121 = a0 x + a1 x3/2\n10\n\nfor x \u2192 0 .\n\n(4.31)\n\n\fThen, see Appendix A,\nlim xC3,sc (\u03c6+ )(x) = \u2212(a0 )3 a1 \u03933,1 ,\nZ 1\n1\n\u03933,1 = \u2212\ndu\n(2 \u2212 4u\u22121/2 )(1 \u2212 u3/2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 u)3/2 ) .\nu(1 \u2212 u)\n0\n\nx\u21920\n\n(4.32)\n\nNumerically \u03933,1 = 5.56. We arrive at\n\u2212 K1 a0 (e\n\u03bd \u2212 1) = a30 \u03934,1 \u2212 K2 a30 a1 \u03933,1 ,\n\n(4.33)\n\nwhich determines a1 . Thus \u03c6+ has a subleading behavior as \u2212a1 x\u22121/2 for x \u2192 0.\nBy the same procedure one could, in principle, compute the next order corrections\nto \u03c6+ .\nAt first sight the nonlinear eigenvalue problems (4.6) and (4.28) look rather\nsimilar, except for a further collision operator and the change of sign on the left.\nOn physical grounds we expect however a very different solution behavior. (4.6)\nshould have a single eigenvalue, or possibly a discrete set of eigenvalues [6], while\n(4.28) should have for any \u03bde with 1 < \u03bde < 3/2 a solution satisfying the boundary\nconditions (4.17) and (4.23).\nPhysically the most interesting, and accessible, prediction is the exponent \u03b3 of\n(4.27) which governs the initial increase in the condensate density. If in (4.19). one\nsets 7/6 \u2264 \u03bde < 3/2, then, according to Proposition 1, C4 provides a mechanism for\nnucleation. Immediately, i.e. for any t > 0, the divergence at x = 0 drops to a(t)/x,\na(t) from (4.22). For \u03bde = \u03bd \u223c\n= 1.234 numerical simulations are available [7] and yield\n\u03b3 = 0.571 in good agreement with the prediction (4.27). At \u03bde = 7/6, (4.27) results\nin \u03b3 = 1. Aspects of this case have been established mathematically by Escobedo et\nal. and we state their results in Appendix B. Also the numerical solutions in [1, 5]\nclearly show a linear initial increase in the condensate density and the rapid switch\nfrom the initial divergence x\u22127/6 to the slower x\u22121 . For 1 < \u03bde < 7/6 and n(0) = 0,\nno mechanism for nucleation at time t = 0 is available. (Of course, at some later\ntime the scenario as described under (i) may set in). Thus to verify the prediction\n(4.27) one would have to start with some small n(0), so to set C3 in action.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the \"naive\" picture of the condensation process the distribution function f develops a \u03b4-like concentration close to the origin, either at some finite time or in the\nlong time limit. The Boltzmann-Nordheim kinetic equation tells a different story,\nhowever: If there is sufficient mass accumulated near the origin,\u221athe solution develops explosively a 1/x singularity at 0 (which is integrable for xdx). Once the\nsingularity is formed, mass of the normal fluid can be channeled\nR \u221e into the condensate.\nOn the other hand the condensate is annihilated at a rate 2 0 dxxf (x, t). For long\ntimes both processes balance so to approach the equilibrium condensate density.\n11\n\n\fA\n\nAppendix: Proofs of Propositions 1, 2 and Eqs.\n(4.30), (4.32).\n\nWe start with the slightly easier proof of Proposition 2.\nProof of Proposition 2: We have to study the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 of\nZ \u221e Z x\n\u0001\n2\ndx\ndy {f (x \u2212 y)f (y) \u2212 f (x)f (x \u2212 y) \u2212 f (x)f (y)} \u2212 f (x)\n\u03b4\n0\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u0001\n+4\ndx\ndy {f (x)f (y) + f (y \u2212 x)f (y) \u2212 f (x)f (y \u2212 x)} + f (y)\n\u03b4\n\nx\n\n= A1 (\u03b4) + A2 (\u03b4) + A3 (\u03b4) ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere A1 (\u03b4) is the integral with the first curly bracket, A2 (\u03b4) the one with the second\ncurly bracket, and A3 (\u03b4) is the sum of the two integrals linear in f .\nWe consider A1 (\u03b4). Each summand is linearly transformed such that the integrand is of product form, f (x)f (y).

For any f satisfying (B.1) to (B.3), there exists a unique solution, f (x, t), to (2.2), continuously differentiable in t for 0 < t < \u221e and continuous\nin x for 0 < x < \u221e, as well as a function b(t), satisfying\n0 \u2264 f (x, t) \u2264 Lx\u22127/6 e\u2212Dx ,\n\nx > 0,\n\n|f (x, t) \u2212 b(t)x\u22127/6 | \u2264 Lx\u2212(7/6\u2212\u03b4/2) ,\n0 \u2264 b(t) \u2264 L ,\n\nt \u2208 (0, T ) ,\n\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 1,\n\nt \u2208 (0, T ) ,\n\nt \u2208 (0, T ) ,\n\n(B.4)\n(B.5)\n(B.6)\n\nfor some positive constant L and for some T > 0, T depending on A, B, and \u03b4.\nTogether with our Proposition 1 it then follows that, for 0 \u2264 t < T ,\ne(f (t)) = e(f ) ,\n\u03c1(f (t)) = \u03c1(f ) \u2212 \u03934\nn(t) = \u03934\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(B.7)\n\nt\n\ndsb(s)3 ,\n\n(B.8)\n\n0\n\nt\n\ndsb(s)3 .\n\n(B.9)\n\n0\n\nThus the condensate density increases linearly in t for small t.\nIt would be of interest to extend such a result to the coupled system. As argued,\nwe expect that C3 dominates C4 and therefore in (B.5) the divergence at x = 0 should\ndrop from x\u22127/6 to x\u22121 , as also reported in [1] for numerical solutions.\nCurrently, the restriction to bounded T is needed for the proof. Whether there\nis really such a restriction can only be speculated. One could argue that by the\nchoice of initial conditions one has opened already a channel for the formation of\ncondensate.
