The talk is based on [3\u2104. Early in [7\u2104, Xu invented Morita equivalen e\nof Poisson manifolds with the inspiration from Rie\u001bel's Morita equivalen e of C\u2217 algebras. However it works only for integrable Poisson manifolds, i.e. those Poisson\nmanifolds who pro ess symple ti groupoids. A symple ti groupoid [6\u2104 is a Lie\ngroupoid S \u21d2 P with a symple ti form \u03c9 on S satisfying\npr1\u2217 \u03c9 + pr2\u2217 \u03c9 = m\u2217 \u03c9,\n(1)\non the set of omposable arrows S \u00d7P S (m is the multipli ation on S ). Then\nthe base P of the symple ti groupoid S \u21d2 P has an indu ed Poisson stru ture\nsu h that the sour e map s : S \u2192 P is a Poisson map and the target t : S \u2192 P\nis anti-Poisson. In fa t there is a one-to-one orresponden e between integrable\nPoisson manifolds and sour e-simply onne ted symple ti groupoids.\nMorita equivalen e of Lie groupoids is well-studied and now widely used in\nthe theory of di\u001berentiable sta ks. Roughly speaking, di\u001berentiable sta ks an be\nviewed as Lie groupoids up to Morita equivalen e (see for example [1\u2104). Adding\nompatible symple ti stru ture inside, [7\u2104 established Morita equivalen e of symple ti groupoids and proved further that Poisson manifolds P1 and P2 are Morita\nequivalent if and only if their symple ti groupoids are Morita equivalent.\nNow [4\u2104 [5\u2104 show that even a non-integrable Poisson manifold pro esses a sort\nof symple ti groupoid S \u21d2 P , but S is not anymore a manifold but an \u00e9tale\ndi\u001berentiable sta k1 whi h pro esses a ompatible symple ti form as in (1). Then\nthe one-to-one orresponden e is extended to the set of all Poisson manifolds and\nthat of sour e-2- onne ted symple ti sta ky groupoids (see Theorem 2.4).\nIn our program, we \u001crst build Morita equivalen e for sta ky groupoids, then we\nadd ompatible symple ti forms inside and build Morita equivalen e for symple ti sta ky groupoids and hen e for the base Poisson manifolds.\n1.\n\nSta ky groupoids and their prin ipal bundles\n\nWe \u001crst say a few more words on the sta ky groupoid G \u21d2 M we use. For\nan exa t de\u001cnition, we refer the reader to [8\u2104. The spa e of arrows G is a differentiable sta k, and the spa e of obje ts M is a manifold. It has s, t, m, e,\ni as sour e, target, multipli ation, identity, and inverse map respe tively, just as\nin the ase of Lie groupoids. The only di\u001beren e now is that the multipli ation\nis not stri tly asso iative but asso iative up to a 2-morphism \u03b1 whi h satis\u001ces a\n1An \u00e9tale di\u001berentiable sta k is a di\u001berentiable sta k presented by an \u00e9tale Lie groupoid.\nCareful readers \u001cnd out that S is presented by a groupoid and itself again is a groupoid over a\nmanifold P . But these two groupoids are two di\u001berent ones. In fa t putting them together we\n\nhave a Lie 2-groupoid [8\u2104.\n\n1\n\n\fpentagon ondition. The same happens to all the other identities we had before\nfor Lie groupoids. Namely all these identities su h as (gh)k = g(hk), 1g = g ,\net ., do not hold stri tly, but still hold up to something in a ontrolled way. This\n`2'-phenomenon is new when we step into the world of sta ks. It will ome ba k\nto haunt us all the time (for example De\u001cnition 1.1). The alternative way is to\nwork with Lie 2-groupoids whi h are essentially equivalent to SLie groupoids [8\u2104.\nWe established Morita equivalen e of Lie 2-groupoids there.\nTo shorten the notation, we all these sta ky groupoids SLie groupoids, and\nwhen G is further an \u00e9tale di\u001berentiable sta k, a W-groupoid2. A symple ti Wgroupoid is a W-groupoid whi h has a ompatible symple ti form as in (1).\nTo build Morita equivalen e, we \u001crst need the notion of prin ipal bundles of\nsta ky groupoids.\n\nDe\u001cnition 1.1 (SLie (W-)groupoid a tions). Let G be an SLie (W-)groupoid over\nM , X di\u001berentiable sta k and J : X \u2192 M a smooth morphism. A right G -a tion\non X is a smooth morphism\n\u03a6 : X \u00d7M G \u2192 X ,\n\nsatis\u001ces the following properties:\n(1) \u03a6 \u25e6 (\u03a6 \u00d7 id) = \u03a6 \u25e6 (id \u00d7 m) holds up to a 2-morphism a;\n(2) J \u25e6 \u03a6 = s \u25e6 pr2 , where pr2 : X \u00d7M G \u2192 G ;\n(3) \u03a6 \u25e6 (id \u00d7 (e \u25e6 J)) = id holds up to a 2-morphism b.\nThe 2-morphisms satisfy higher oheren es, whi h roughly says that the following\ndiagrams ommute:\n((xg1 )g2 )g3\ngOOO\nOOO\nOOO\nOO\n(x(g1 g2 ))g3\no7\no\no\no\no\nooo\nooo\n/ x((g1 g2 )g3 )\n\ngg\nggggg\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\nggggg\ns gggg\ng\n\n(xg1 )(g2 g3 )\nOOO\nOOO\nOOO\nOO'\nx(g1 (g2 g3 ))\n\nx(g * 1)\nFF\nt\nt\nFF\ntt\nFF\nt\nt\nFF\nt\nF\"\nztt\n/ xg\n(xg) * 1\n\nGiven su h an a tion, we an form a quotient sta k X /G as in [2\u2104. Unfortunately,\nthe quotient sta k is not always a di\u001berentiable sta k again. For this, we need\nprin ipality of the a tion.\n2The `W' omes from Alan Weinstein, who suggested this sta ky approa h to one of the\n\nauthors.\n\n2\n\n\fRe all that an a tion \u03a6 : X \u00d7M G \u2192 X of a Lie groupoid G \u21d2 M on a manifold\nX is prin ipal if and only if X/G is a manifold and pr1 \u00d7\u03a6 : X \u00d7M G \u2212\u2192 X \u00d7X/G X\nis an isomorphism. We have the following de\u001cnition:\n\nDe\u001cnition 1.2 (Prin ipal SLie (W-) groupoid bundles). Let G \u21d2 M be an\nSLie (-W) groupoid. A left G -bundle over a di\u001berentiable sta k X is a di\u001berentiable\n\nsta k X together with a smooth morphism \u03c0 : X \u2192 S and a right a tion \u03a6\nsatisfying\n(2)\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03c0 \u25e6 pr2\nup to a 2-isomorphism \u03b1 : \u03c0 \u25e6 pr2 \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6. (Here pr2 : G \u00d7M X \u2192 X is the natural\nproje tion.) The 2-isomorphism \u03b1 satis\u001ces a further oheren e ondition.\nThe bundle is prin ipal if \u03c0 is a surje tive submersion and\npr1 \u00d7 \u03a6 : X \u00d7M G \u2192 X \u00d7S X\n\nis an isomorphism. Then the a tion \u03a6 is also alled prin ipal.\n\nExample 1.3 (A point as a prin ipal Z bundle). A point pt is a prin ipal Z bundle\nover the sta k BZ. The a tion of Z on pt is trivial, so it is not prin ipal in the\nlassi al sense. However, pt is a prin ipal Z bundle as in De\u001cnition 1.2 be ause\npt \u00d7BZ pt = Z (see [1\u2104 for the de\u001cnition of \u001cbre produ t of di\u001berentiable sta ks)\nand\npt \u00d7 Z \u2192 pt \u00d7BZ pt,\n\nis an isomorphism of sta ks.\n\nTheorem 1.4. Let G be an SLie (W-) groupoid. If \u03c0 : X \u2192 S is a G -prin ipal\nbundle over S , then X /G is a di\u001berentiable sta k and is isomorphi to the base S .\nMoreover X /G is presented by a Lie groupoid whose spa e of arrows is E\u03a6 /G1 and\nwhose spa e of obje ts is X0 . Here X1 \u21d2 X0 is a Lie groupoid presentation of X ,\nG1 \u21d2 G0 is that of G and E\u03a6 is the H-S bibundle of the G -a tion \u03a6.\n2.\n\nMorita equivalen e of SLie groupoids\n\nDe\u001cnition 2.1 (Morita equivalen e of SLie groupoids). Two SLie groupoids G1 \u21d2\nM1 and G2 \u21d2 M2 are Morita equivalent if there is a di\u001berentiable sta k X and\n\ntwo smooth morphisms Ji : X \u2192 Gi (moment maps) su h that\n(1) J1 : X \u2192 M1 is a right prin ipal G2 -bundle;\n(2) J2 : X \u2192 M2 is a left prin ipal G1 -bundle;\n(3) \u03a62 \u25e6(\u03a61 \u00d7id) = \u03a61 \u25e6(id\u00d7\u03a62 ) holds up to a 2-isomorphism a whi h satis\u001ces\nsix higher oheren e onditions.\nIn this ase we all X a (G1 , G2 )-Morita bibundle.\n\nIt is simple to he k that Morita equivalen e is re\u001dexive (G itself is a (G, G )Morita equivalen e) and symmetri (use inverses to make right a tions into left\nand vi e-versa). However transitivity is nontrivial and we need to use Theorem\n1.4.\nMoreover we also have,\n3\n\n\fProposition 2.2. If two W-groupoids are Morita equivalent via Morita bibundle\nX , then X is an \u00e9tale di\u001berentiable sta k.\nProposition 2.3. Two W-groupoids Gi \u21d2 Mi are Morita equivalent via Morita\nbibundle X . If G1 \u21d2 M1 is a Lie groupoid, then X is a manifold and G2 \u21d2 M2 is\nalso a Lie groupoid.\nFinally, two symple ti W-groupoids (G1 , \u03c91 ) \u21d2 M1 and (G2 , \u03c92 ) \u21d2 M2 are\n\nMorita equivalent if they are Morita equivalent as SLie groupoids via a symple ti\n\n\u00e9tale sta k (X , \u03c9) satisfying\n\non G1 \u00d7M1 X ,\nwhere \u03a61 is the a tion of G1 on X , and the same for \u03c9 and \u03c92 .\npr1\u2217 \u03c91 + pr2\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03a6\u22171 \u03c9,\n\nTheorem 2.4. [5\u2104 For any symple ti W-groupoid G \u21d2 M , the base manifold M\nhas a unique Poisson stru ture su h that the sour e map s is Poisson. In this ase,\nwe all G a symple ti W-groupoid of the Poisson manifold M .\nOn the other hand, for any Poisson manifold M , there are two symple ti\ngroupoids G(M ) and H(M ) of M . G(M ) has 2- onne ted sour e \u001cbre and H(M )\nhas only 1- onne ted sour e \u001cbre.\nDe\u001cnition 2.5. Two Poisson manifolds M1 and M2 are alled strongly Morita\nequivalent if G(M1 ) and G(M2 ) are Morita equivalent as symple ti W-groupoids.\nRespe tively, they are alled weakly Morita equivalent if H(M1 ) and H(M2 ) are\nMorita equivalent as symple ti W-groupoids.\n\nStrong Morita equivalen e implies the weak one, and weak Morita equivalen e\noin ides with the lassi al one in [7\u2104 when applied to integrable Poisson manifolds.\nBut strong Morita equivalen e is something new. For example, in [7\u2104, with their\nusual symple ti forms, R2 and the 2-sphere S 2 are Morita equivalent sin e all the\nsimply onne ted symple ti manifolds are Morita equivalent in the lassi al sense.\nBut they are not strongly Morita equivalent be ause they have di\u001berent \u03c02 groups.\nIn fa t, only 2- onne ted symple ti manifolds are strongly Morita equivalent to\nea h other. We hope this \u03c02 -phenomenon will help in symple ti geometry, for\nexample, in the aspe t of preservation of prequantization.\n\nReferen es\n[1\u2104 K. Behrend and P. Xu.
