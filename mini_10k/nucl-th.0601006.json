We can establish a new picture, the perfect fluid sQGP core and the dissipative hadronic\ncorona, of the space-time evolution of produced matter in relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC.\nIt is also shown that the picture works well also in the forward rapidity region through an analysis\nbased on a new class of the hydro-kinetic model and is a manifestation of deconfinement.\n\nThe agreement of ideal hydrodynamic predictions [1] of integrated and differential\nelliptic flow and radial flow patterns with Au+Au data at RHIC energies [2, 3, 4, 5] is\none of the main lines of the announcement, \"RHIC serves the perfect liquid\" [6]. We\nfirst study the sensitivity of this conclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions in\nthe hadron phase. It is found that an assumption of chemical equilibrium neglecting viscosity in the hadron phase in hydrodynamic simulations causes accidental reproduction\nof transverse momentum spectra and differential elliptic flow data. From a systematic\ncomparison of hydrodynamic results with the experimental data, dissipative effects are\nfound to be mandatory in the hadron phase. Therefore, what is discovered at RHIC is\nnot only the perfect fluidity of the sQGP core but also its dissipative hadronic corona.\nAlong the lines of these studies, we develop a hybrid dynamical model in which a fully\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic description of the QGP phase is followed by a kinetic\ndescription of the hadron phase. We show rapidity dependence of elliptic flow from this\nhybrid model supports the above picture. Finally, we argue that this picture is a manifestation of deconfinement transition.\nA perfect QGP fluid is assumed in most hydrodynamic simulations. While one can\nfind various assumptions in the hadron phase, e.g. (1) ideal and chemical equilibrium\n(CE) fluid, (2) ideal and chemically frozen fluid (or partial chemical equilibrium, PCE),\nor (3) non-equilibrium resonance gas through hadronic cascade models (HC). Hydrodynamic results are compared with the current differential elliptic flow data, v2 (pT ), in\nFig. 20 in Ref. [7] with putting an emphasis on the difference of assumptions in the\nhadron phase. The classes CE and HC reproduce the pion data well. On the contrary,\nresults from the second class, PCE, deviate from these hydrodynamic results and experimental data. To claim the discovery of perfect fluidity, we need to understand the\ndifference among hydrodynamic results. v2 is roughly proportional to pT in low pT region for pions. In such a case, the slope of v2 (pT ) can be approximated by v2 /hpT i.\nIntegrated v2 is generated in the early stage of collisions. Whereas differential v2 can be\nsensitive to the late hadronic stage since mean transverse momentum hpT i continues to\nvary.

(Left) Mean transverse momentum for pions as a function of thermal freezeout temperature\n\u221a\nat b = 5 fm in sNN = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. Solid (dashed) line shows a result with an assumption\nof an ideal, chemical equilibrium (chemically frozen) hadronic fluid. (Right) Pseudorapidity dependence\nof elliptic flow from hydro and hydro+hadronic cascade models are compared with data [4].\n\nincluding contribution from resonance decays are calculated at a RHIC energy by utilizing hydrodynamic simulations [8]. hpT i for pions in the chemically frozen hadronic\nfluid decreases with decreasing T th . This is due to longitudinal pdV work done by fluid\nelements. Whereas hpT i in chemical equilibrium increases during expansion. The total number of particles in a fluid element decreases due to the assumptions of chemical\nequilibrium and entropy conservation in the hadron phase. Then the total energy is distributed among the smaller number of particles as a fluid element expands. This is the\nreason why the different behavior of hpT i appears according to the assumption of chemical equilibrium/freezeout. Under the chemical equilibrium assumption, increase of hpT i\nis commonly utilized to fix T th by fitting pT slope. However, this is attained only by neglecting particle ratio. On the other hand, the slope of differential elliptic flow v2 /hpT i\nis reproduced by canceling increase behaviors of both v2 and hpT i [8]. Agreement of the\nCE model with pT spectra and v2 (pT ) data is merely an accident in the sense that this\nmodel makes full use of neglecting particle ratio to reproduce them. So the HC model\nturns out to be the only model which reproduces properly particle ratio, pT spectra and\nv2 (pT ) data. Therefore a picture of the dissipative hadronic corona together with the\nperfect fluid sQGP core is consistent with these experimental data observed at RHIC.\nAccording to the above discussion, we incorporate a hadronic cascade model, JAM\n[9], into our dynamical framework [10]. Details of the hybrid model is found in Ref. [11].\nFigure 1 (right) shows pseudorapidity dependences of v2 from this hybrid model and\nideal 3D hydrodynamics with T th = 100 and 169 MeV. Here critical temperature and\nchemical freezeout temperature are taken as being Tc = T ch = 170 MeV in the hydrodynamic model. In the hybrid model, the switching temperature from a hydrodynamic description to a kinetic one is taken as Tsw = 169 MeV. Ideal hydrodynamics with\nT th = 100 MeV which is so chosen to generate enough radial flow gives a trapezoidal\nshape of v2 (\u03b7 ) [12]. A large deviation between data [4] and the ideal hydrodynamic result is seen especially in forward/backward rapidity regions. When hadronic rescattering\n\n6\n\n\feffects are taken through the hadronic cascade model instead of perfect fluid description\nof the hadron phase, v2 is not so generated in the forward region due to the dissipation and, eventually, is consistent with the data. So the perfect fluid sQGP core and the\ndissipative hadronic corona picture works well also in the forward region. It should be\nnoted that, recently, this conclusion is found to depend on centralities and how to initialize hydrodynamic fields: There is a room for initial QGP viscous effects in peripheral\ncollisions in CGC initial conditions. For a detailed discussion, see Ref. [11].\nWe can establish a new picture of space-time evolution of produced matter from a\ncareful comparison of hydrodynamic results with experimental data observed at RHIC.\nWhat is the physics behind this picture? \u03b7 /s is known to be a good measure to see the\neffect of viscosity where \u03b7 is the shear viscosity and s is the entropy density. \u03b7 /s might\nbe small in the QGP phase, which is comparable with the minimum value 1/4\u03c0 [13], and\nthe perfect fluid assumption can be valid. While \u03b7 /s becomes huge in the hadron phase\nand the dissipation cannot be neglected. Shear viscosities of both phases are found to\ngive \u03b7 \u223c 0.1 GeV/fm2 around Tc [8]. So shear viscosity itself appears to increase with\ntemperature monotonically. The \"perfect fluid\" property of the sQGP is thus not due\nto a sudden reduction of the viscosity at the critical temperature Tc , but to a sudden\nincrease of the entropy density of QCD matter and is therefore an important signature of\ndeconfinement.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the United States Department of Energy under Grant\nNo. DE-FG02-93ER40764.
