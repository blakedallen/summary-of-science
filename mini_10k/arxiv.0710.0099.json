Introduction\nSolitary waves are self-guided wave packets as they propagate in nonlinear media,\nremaining localized and preserving their own shape. However, they are dramatically\naltered when collide with one another. Strictly speaking, only the special case of Kerr\nnonlinearity is integrable by the inverse scattering transform method. Soliton belongs\nto a special family of solitary waves that are unaffected by collisions. They are particlelike wave packets supported by the nonlinear action and their collision behavior are\nstrongly depends upon the relative phase between the interacting solitons [1]. With\nsuch asymptotically linear superposition of nonlinear interaction, a new window of\nsoliton-based photonics can be employed in different optical switching devices and\ncommunication systems [2].\nDuring last decade, photonic crystals, artificial periodic structures with the\nmodulation in the refractive index, provide an efficient control of wave transmission\nand localization, making it possible to tailor dispersion, diffraction, and emission\nof electromagnetic waves [3]. Combination of Kerr nonlinear material and photonic\ncrystals, nonlinear photonic crystals have revealed a wealth of nonlinear optical\nphenomena and, in particular, self-trapped nonlinear localized modes in the form of\nso called gap solitons [4, 5, 6]. Gap solitons are unique solutions which can be formed\nno matter in focusing or defocusing media due to the change of the dispersion/diffraction\neffect caused by the photonic lattices [7]. Current technology in reconfigurable optical\nlattices, such as photorefractive crystals [8] and nematic liquid crystals [9], also pave a\nnew way to control solitary waves by varying the lattice depth and period.\nWith both benefits from photonic crystals and solitons, gap soliton is believed to\nbe an important key footstone in soliton-driven photonics. For Kerr-type nonlinear\nphotonic crystals, the bifurcation and stability of gap solitons in internal reflection and\nBragg gap regions are studied with local nonlinear response [10]. However, the limited\nmobility of gap soliton in the transverse directions due to corresponding lattice potentials\ndraws great concerns for various switching and routing operations [11, 12]. Recently it\nhas been predicted that with non-locality solitons can move across the lattice drastically\neasily in the internal reflection region [13]. Nonlocal effect comes to play an important\nrole as the characteristic response function of the medium is comparable to the transverse\ncontent of the wave packet [14]. Experimental observations of nonlocal response\nalso have been demonstrated in various systems, such as photorefractive crystals [15],\nnematic liquid crystals [16], and thermo-optical materials [17]. The study of nonlocal\nnonlinearity brings new features in solitons [18], such as modification of modulation\ninstability [19], azimuthal instability [20], and transverse instability [21]. Suppression\nof collapse in multidimensional solitons [22], change of the soliton interaction [23],\nformation of soliton bound states [24] and unique families of dark-bright soliton pairs\n[25] are also predicted recently.\nFor nonlocal nonlinear medium, the non-locality is known to improve the\nstabilization of solitons due to the diffusion mechanism of nonlinearity. Nevertheless,\n\n\fElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\n\n3\n\nto the best of our knowledge, the existences, stabilities, mobilities, and collisions of\ngap solitons in Bragg gap regions have not been reported. In this work, we extend\nthe concept of gap solitons in nonlocal nonlinear photonic crystals [13], from internal\nreflection to Bragg gap regions. The propagation and stability of gap solitons with\nan imprinted transverse index modulation under the influence of nonlocal effect are\nstudied. With the oscillation nature of wave packets in the Bragg regions, we show that\ngap soliton are more stable and movable even with a small degree of non-locality.\nThis work is organized as follows, first we show that in the band gap region nonlinear\nBloch wave can support bright soliton solutions. Families of even and odd modes of\nbright gap solitons imprinted onto Bloch wave in local and nonlocal non-linearities\nare found numerically. Then the modulation instability of these nonlocal gap soliton\nfamilies are analyzed by a standard linear stability analysis, and the Peierls-Nabarro\n(PN) potentials that inhibit the mobility of the gap solitons are also calculated in terms\nof nonlocality. Finally, we address the transverse mobility and soliton interactions under\nthe influence of non-locality with the presence of periodic potentials. Based on the\ndramatic reduction of the PN potential barrier for gap solitons in Bragg regions, we\ndemonstrate a non-trivial elastic-like collision between gap solitons, which should be\nuseful for optical switching devices based on soliton collisions.\n2. Nonlocal solitons in Bragg gaps\nWe consider a wave packet propagating along the z axis in the nonlocal nonlinear\nphotonic crystals with a Kerr-type nonlinearity and an exponential-type nonlocal\nresponse, which can be modeled by the modified nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\u2202\u03a8 1 \u2202 2\n+\n\u03a8 \u2212 V (x)\u03a8 + n(x, z)\u03a8 = 0,\n(1)\n\u2202z\n2 \u2202x2\n\u22022n\n(2)\nn \u2212 d 2 = |\u03a8|2 ,\n\u2202x\nwhere \u03a8 is the envelope function of the wave packet, x is the transverse coordinate, and\nn(x, z) is the refractive index profile induced by the exponential-type kernel function\nresponding to the intensity soliton intensity [26]. V (x) is the periodic potential provided\nexternally in the transverse direction. The coefficient d stands for the degree of\nnonlocality which governs the diffusion strength of refractive index.\ni\n\n2.1. Linear band diagram\nThe periodicity of potential V (x) in Eq.(1) suggests that the stationary states can be\nexpanded by Bloch waves \u03a8(x, z) = f (x)eikx+ibz , where f (x + T ) = f (x) is a periodic\nfunction with period T . If the medium is linear, n(x, z) = 0, we can drop the nonlinear\nindex response and rewrite Eq.(1) in terms of f (x),\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk2\nd\n1 d2\n\u2212\n+ ik\n\u2212 V (x) f = bf,\n(3)\n2 dx2\n2\ndx\n\n\fElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\n\n4\n\nBand\u2212Diagram ( b\u2212V )\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n5\n\nA\nC\n\nb\n\n0\n\u22125\n\nB\nD\n\n\u221210\n\u221215\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1st;k=\u00b1\u03c0/T\n\n1st;k=0\n\nA\n\n3\n\n4\n\nV0\n\n2nd;k=\u00b1\u03c0/T\n\nB\n\nT/2 \u2212T/2\n\n\u2212T/2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2nd;k=0\n\nD\n\nC\n\nT/2 \u2212T/2\n\nT/2\u2212T/2\n\nT/2\n\nFigure 1.

Different gap\nregions are marked as internal reflection and Bragg gap regions.\n\nwhere k is the transverse wave vector of the wave packet and b is the longitudinal wave\nvector. The linear wave spectrum consists of bands of eigenvalues bn,k in which k(b)\nis a real wave number of the amplitude-bounded oscillatory Bloch waves. The bands\nare separated by gaps where the wave functions are not stationary with Im(b) 6= 0. In\nthe absence of nonlinearity, the solution at the band edge is exactly periodic stationary\nBloch waves; however, in the presence Kerr nonlinearity, bright gap solitons arise from\nthe forbidden gaps in linear case. Figure 1(a) shows the linear band-gap diagram on the\nplane (b,V0 ) that is obtained by solving the linear eigenvalue problem in Eq.(3). Different\nBloch wave patterns at different band edge are plotted in Fig. 1(b) for a comparison.\nIn the numerical calculations, we employ V (x) = \u22123cos(4x) as an example and the\ncorresponding dispersion relation is depicted in Fig. 2 where the value of longitudinal\n\n\f5\n\nElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\nBifurcation Diagram\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\neven mode\n4\n\n25\n\n20\n\nBrag g Gap\n\nInternal Refle ction\n\nd =2\n\nd =2\n\nU\n\n15\n\n10\n\n4\n2 d=0.5\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n0\n10 \u221210\n\n4\n2 d=2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n10 \u221210\n0\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n4\nd=0.5\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n0\n10 \u221210\n\n4\nd=2\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n0\n10 \u221210\n\n(c) odd mode\nd =0\n\nd =0\n\n5\n\n0\n\u22124\n\n2 d=0\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\u221210\n0\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nb\n\n4\nd=0\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\u221210\n0\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nFigure 3.

The green, red, and blue lines are the field u(x), nonlinear index modulation\nn(x), and periodical potential V (x), respectively.\n\nwave vector b for each band edge is addressed. Based on our definitions, a semi-infinite\ninternal reflection region exists for b > 0 while finite Bragg gap regions exist for b < 0,\nas indicated in Fig.2.\n2.2. Bright gap soliton in nonlocal medium\nBy applying the Bloch solution near the band edge of linear eigenvalue problem as an\ninitial trial solution, we find different families of bright gap solitons \u03a8(x, z) = u(x)eibz\nnumerically with a standard relaxation technique and the boundary conditions u(\u00b1\u221e) \u2248\n0. Families of nonlinear gap soliton solutions can be found, as shown in Fig. 3(a).\nHere the bifurcation curves for gap solitons of even-mode and odd-mode in the internal\nreflection and the first Bragg gap regions through the relations of b and soliton power\nR\nU \u2261 |\u03a8(x)|2 d x are shown in red and blue lines, respectively. The two distinct types\nof solitons, on-site (even-mode) and off-site (odd-mode), are defined by their relative\nposition of the center of wave functions with respect to external periodic potential [27].\nIn other words, those centered on the minimum and the maximum potential of the\nlattice are classified as on-site and off-site. Solutions of these gap solitons for on-site\nand off-site modes in the first Bragg gap region for different strength of non-localities,\nd = 0, 0.5, and 2, are plotted in Fig. 3(b, c) corresponding to the red and blue curves\nin Fig. 3(a).\nIn comparison to the local nonlinear medium, d = 0 in Fig. 3(a), as expected nonlocality effect increases the formation power for gap solitons. As a result, the gap soliton\nsolutions, even- and odd-modes both, have a broader width of profile and a smaller level\nof amplitude. In addition to the localized wave packet, gap solitons also have similar\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\fElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\n\n6\n\noscillatory tails as linear Bloch modes in the bands. The oscillatory tails are significant\nin particular near the edge of linear band. Compared to the solitons in the first Bragg\ngap region, gap soliton solutions in the internal reflection region have smooth envelope\nfunction and no oscillation tails are observed [13]. Additionally, the nonlinear refractive\nindex distribution n(x) in the internal reflection region is a smooth symmetric bell-like\nshape without pronounced local maximums on top of it. In the following, we would\nshow that the oscillation nature of Bloch wave makes solitons in the Bragg gap regions\nexhibit better stability and higher mobility.\n2.3. Stability of gap solitons\nThe stability of gap soliton solutions is calculated through linear stability analysis, with\nthe perturbed gap soliton solutions,\nu = u0 (x)eibz + \u01eb[p(x)ei\u03b4z + q(x)e\u2212i\u03b4 z ]eibz ,\n\n(4)\n\nn = n0 + \u2206n\n\n(5)\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere \u01eb \u226a 1, u0 (x) is the unperturbed solution, and Im{\u03b4} indicates the growth rate\nof the perturbations. We linearize Eq.(4,5) around the stationary solution and obtain,\nto the first order in \u01eb, the linear eigenvalue problem for the perturbation modes:\n!\n!\n!\nL\u03020 + N\u03020\nN\u03020\np\np\n=\u03b4\n(6)\n\u2212N\u03020\n\u2212L\u03020 \u2212 N\u03020\nq\nq\nwhere\nL\u03020 \u2261 n0 \u2212 V(x) \u2212 b +\n\n1 \u22022\n,\n2 \u2202x2\n\nand\n\u2202 2 \u22121\n) .\n\u2202x2\nWe solve the eigenvalue problem in Eq.(6) for unstable eigen functions with imaginary\nor complex propagation constant \u03b4 by standard matrix eigenvalue packages. As the case\nof local nonlinear photonic crystals, it turns out that the on-site (even-mode) soliton\nfamily is modulationally stable while the off-site (odd-mode) soliton family is not [10].\nFigure 4(a,b) illustrate that nonlocal effect significantly reduces the growth rate of\nunstable spectral mode for off-site solitons in the internal reflection [13] as well as the\nfirst Bragg gap regions. Furthermore, off-site gap solitons in the first Bragg gap region\nsuffer stronger suppression of instability due to the diffusion of refractive index than the\ncase in the internal reflection region.\nAs seen in Fig. 4 clearly, with a small strength of non-locality the modulation\ninstability of gap solitons in Bragg gap region is impressively suppressed. A simple\nreason is that nonlocal effect can smooth over the oscillation tails of refractive index\nn due to the diffusion mechanism. In other words, the smoothness of refractive index\nn indicates that the effective potential Vef f = V (x) \u2212 n(x) turns more broadened.\nTherefore, as the strength of long range interaction increases, soliton solutions become\nN\u03020 \u2261 |u0 |2 (1 \u2212 d\n\n\f7\n\nElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1.5\n\nIR\n\nd=0\n\n1.5\n\nBG\n\n1\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n1\n\nd=0\n\nd=2\n\n0.5\n\nd=4\n\n0.5\n\nd = 12\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nU\n\n8\n\nd=2\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nU\n\nFigure 4.

Because gap soliton solutions in the Bragg gap regions access oscillation\ntails and their profiles extend more apparently in space, in such a way the nonlocal effect\nbecome more apparently to smooth out the effective potential and to stabilize solitons.\n\n2.4. Mobility and collision of gap solitons\nIn this section we study the mobility of these gap soliton solutions by calculating their\nPeierls-Nabarro (PN) potential barrier which is introduced as the height of an effective\nperiodic potential generated by the lattice discreteness. PN potential barrier defines the\nminimum energy required to move the center of mass of a localized wave packet by one\nlattice site [28]. Extending this definition to the continuous system, we can define PN\n\n\fElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\n\n8\n\nFigure 6. Collision of two solitons in photonic crystals with local (a) and nonlocal\n(b) non-linearities. The degree of non-locality is set as d = 0.5.\n\npotential barrier as the difference of system Hamiltonian between even-modes (on-site)\nand odd-modes (off-site), i.e.\n\u03b4H = Heven \u2212 Hodd\n#\nZ \u221e\"\n2\n1 2\n\u2202u\n\u2212 |u| n dx.\nH=\n\u2202x\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nConsequently, PN potential states the smallest amount of energy that a gap solitons\nneeded to gain in order to start moving along the lattice. It is clearly seen that in the\nfirst Bragg gap region the PN potential barrier is drastically reduced in comparison to\nthe local nonlinearity, d = 0, as well as the internal reflection region, as shown in Fig.\n5(a). With the oscillation tails similar to the linear Bloch waves, nonlocal solitons in\nthe Bragg gap regions are more stable and more movable than those in the internal\nreflection band [13]. The higher the barrier \u03b4H, the larger the incident kinetic energy\nrequired to overcome the barrier. The reduction of the PN barrier is confirmed by\nnumerical simulations of Eq.(1) for gap solitons with fixed power but different initial\nkinetic energies. The initial conditions for Fig. 5(b) are set with u(x, z = 0) = u0 ei\u03b1x ,\nwhere u0 is the stationary solution in Bragg gap region and \u03b1 stands for transverse\nmomentum at incidence. When soliton crosses the lattice it radiates and loses energy.\nEventually these gap solitons are captured by one of the lattice channel. However, while\nthe nonlocality effect comes to play, the total effective potential is shallowed by long\nrange interaction. These nonlocal gap solitons are more free to move in the transverse\ndirection due to a lower PN potential height.\nBased on the results of the PN potential barrier reduction for solitons in the Bragg\ngap regions with non-locality, we demonstrate a potential-free collisions between two gap\nsolitons within the photonic crystals. It is well known that without periodic potentials,\nsolitons experience elastic collisions when the relative phase between them is in-phase.\nThe elastic collision between two solitons is destructed in the photonic systems due to\n\n\fElastic-like Collision of Gap Solitons in Bragg Gap Regions\n\n9\n\nthe confinement of the PN potential barrier, as shown in Fig.6(a) for the local case with\nd = 0. But with nonlocal nonlinear response, in Fig.6(b) we show that gap solitons can\nrevive an elastic-like collision even in the photonic systems. In principle, the collisions\nbetween gap solitons are very complicated and unpredicted due to the interplays among\nnonlinearity, periodic potential height, and dispersion/diffraction effects. Nonetheless,\nin this simulation, only with a small strength of non-locality, d = 0.5 one can have a\nclear picture of gap soliton interactions.\n3. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the existence of gap soliton solutions in nonlocal nonlinear\nphotonic crystals in the internal reflection and Bragg gap regions. The stability and\nmobility of such novel gap solitons are calculated through the linear stability method\nand the Peierls-Nabarro potential barrier. Compared to the internal reection region,\nnonlocal gap solitons in the Bragg gap regions become not only more stable but also\nmore movable due to the oscillation tails of wave packets. Moreover we reveal that it\nis possible to have elastic-like collisions between gap solitons with the help of a small\nstrength of nonlocal effect. Supported by the result of this study and current technology\nabout controllable nonlocal nonlinear media, such as photorefractive crystals, nematic\nliquid crystals and thermo-optical materials, we believe the results in this work should\nprovide a new way for soliton-based photonic devices.\nAuthors are indebted to Tsin-Fu Jiang and Yinchieh Lai for useful discussions.
