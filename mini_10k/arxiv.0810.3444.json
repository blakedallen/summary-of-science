INTRODUCTION\nFlavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays are forbidden at tree level in the standard model (SM). They can\nproceed through loop processes \u2013 an example is displayed in Fig. 1 \u2013 at a considerably suppressed rate. The modes\nunder study have additional helicity and GIM suppression, and have SM branching fractions beyond the reach of\ncurrent experiments. The largest predicted branching fraction is about 4 \u00d7 10\u22129 for the decay Bs0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , the\nothers being more than an order of magnitude smaller.\n\nFigure 1: Short distance Feynman diagrams for D0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .\n\nA primary interest in these modes is as probes of new physics (NP). NP can enter either at tree level, or through\nloop processes, and can increase the branching fraction by orders of magnitude. These modes provide the best limits\non a number of NP scenarios.\nLepton-flavor violating (LFV) decays are strictly forbidden in the SM, so observation is a clear sign of NP. (The\nLFV in neutrino oscillations plays an insignificant role in the decays studied here.)\n0\n0\n0\nCDF searched for the decays B(s)\n\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , B(s)\n\u2192 e+ e\u2212 , B(s)\n\u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 , and D0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . (Inclusion of change\nconjugate modes is assumed throughout.) The searches share many features. The search is performed relative to a\nnormalization mode chosen for its similarity to the search mode. This avoids the difficulty of determining absolute\nefficiencies, and largely cancels many systematics.\nThe selection criteria for the search mode are optimized in an unbiased manner, with the events in the search\nwindow blinded. A Monte Carlo with a detailed detector simulation is used to simulate signal events. Background is\nestimated from sideband data, data before lepton identification, and Monte Carlo when appropriate. The production,\nacceptance, and reconstruction efficiency of the search mode are determined relative to the normalization mode.\nWith the selection optimized, the data is unblinded. None of the investigated decays showed a significant signal after\nunblinding, so branching fraction limits are determined, for example, as:\n\nB\n\nlim\n\n(Bs0\n\n+ \u2212\n\n\u2192e e )=\n\n\u0012\n\nNelim\n+ e\u2212\nNK + \u03c0 \u2212\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u01ebK + \u03c0 \u2212\n\u01ebe+ e\u2212\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nfd\nfs\n\n\u0013\n\nB(Bd0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\n-1\n\nCDF RUN II Preliminary ( 2 fb )\n2000\n1800\n\nEvent/20MeV/c2\n\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n4.8\n\n4.9\n\n5.0\n\n5.1\n\n5.2\n\nM(\u03c0+ \u03c0-)\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n5.5\n\n5.6\n\n5.7\n\n5.8\n\n2\n\nGeV/c\n\n0\nFigure 2: Two track \u03c0\u03c0 mass plot.

Equation 1 is\nfor Bs0 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , and the obvious substitutions yield the expressions for the other modes.\nIn the following section we present some of the specific challenges of each analysis, then summarize the results and\ndiscuss limits on NP that can be derived.\n\n2. THE ANALYSES\n0\nThe B(s)\n\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 analysis for 2 fb\u22121 of integrated lumninosity is published [1] and will be omitted in this proceeding\nin the interest of devoting more space to the unpublished results. The limits are displayed in Table I.\n0\n0\n\u2192 e+ e\u2212 decays are normalized to the charmless Bd0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay [2]. The\nThe B(s)\n\u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 and B(s)\n+ \u2212\nnumber of K \u03c0 decays is extracted from data collected by a two-track, separated vertex trigger (TTT) from 2 fb\u22121\nof integrated luminosity. This trigger selects events with two oppositely charged tracks with transverse momenta\nabove 2 GeV/c, impact parameters between 140 \u03bcm and 1000 \u03bcm to the beam spot, and a transverse decay length\n0\ngreater than 200 \u03bcm. The decays B(s,d)\n\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + K \u2212 reconstructed from the trigger track-pairs are\nindistinguishable in the invariant mass plot (Fig. 2), and are separated on a statistical basis as described in [3].\nThe e\u03bc and ee decays are extracted from this same data by reconstructing the trigger track-pairs as either e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213\nor e+ e\u2212 and then requiring the tracks be matched to hits in the muon detectors, or to an energy cluster in the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter. Additional background suppression for electrons is provided by requiring an ionization\nenergy loss, dE/dx, in the outer tracker inconsistent with hadrons. For electrons, bremstrahlung in the detector\ncan result in significant energy loss producing a tail in the reconstructed invariant mass distribution. To maintain\ngood acceptance, a generous search window is used, \u00b13\u03c3 around the nominal Bs or Bd mass for the e\u03bc modes, and\n(\u22126\u03c3, +3\u03c3) for the ee modes. The backgrounds are primarily combinatorial and from misidentified B 0 \u2192 hh\u2032 decays.\nThe unblinded mass plots (Fig. 3) reveal two events in the Bd0 \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 and e+ e\u2212 mass windows, one event in the\nBs0 \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 and e+ e\u2212 mass windows.

Two body D0 decays\nare reconstructed from the trigger tracks in events selected by the TTT from 360 pb\u22121 of integrated luminosity.\nCombinatorial background to the normalization and search channels is greatly reduced by requiring an associated\npion from the decay chain D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + . The small mass difference between pions and muons leads to invariant\nmass distributions that overlap significantly as shown in Fig. 4.

The large peaks are normalization mode D0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. The vertical\ndotted lines indicate the \u03bc\u03bc search window.\n\nA careful study of background sources revealed that a significant background exists from pairs of real muons coming\nfrom the sequential decay chain B \u2192 D\u03bcX and D \u2192 \u03bcY . This background is suppressed using a likelihood ratio\nbased on decay length, decay length significance, and impact parameter of the candidate D0 to the primary vertex.\nWhen the data is unblinded we observe three central-central events, zero central-extension events, and one\nextension-extension event, consistent with the background estimate.

RESULTS\nThe limits from these analyses are displayed in Table I, along with the previous best published limit and the\nexperiment that produced it. From these limits we derive limits on NP models.
