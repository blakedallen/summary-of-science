Let R1 and R2\nbe the radii of the particles and \u2206h their initial vertical\nspacing. At time t = 0 we release the particles to collide\nwith the floor. The question for the maximum height\nreached by the upper sphere after the collision is then\na common textbook problem. The textbook solution is\nbased on the assumption that the collisions of the lower\nparticle with the floor and the subsequent collision of the\nlower particle with the upper one are separate two-body\ninteractions which may be treated independently, that\nis, one disregards the duration of the collisions. Whether\nthis assumption is justified depends, of course, on the\ninitial conditions, the particle sizes and the material parameters.\nThe experimental investigation of the described problem is tricky as even a small deviation from the vertical\nalignment of the initial positions of the spheres leads to\nconsiderable post-collisional velocities in horizontal direction, in particular, if more than two balls are involved.\nSimple but effective techniques were introduced[1\u20133],\nwhich allow for experiments with chains of up to about\n\n7 aligned balls.\nIn this paper we will show that although the problem\nlooks simple, there may emerge rather complex behavior\nincluding multiple collisions. The simple solution mentioned above is, thus, only a special case of a more general\nsolution.\n\nII.\n\nINDEPENDENT COLLISION MODEL\nA.\n\nCollision Scenario\n\nTo introduce our notation and for later reference let us\nfirst reproduce the solution for the independent collisions\nmodel (ICM), that is, the final velocity of the upper ball is\nthe result of a) the inelastic collision of the lower ball with\nthe floor and b) the inelastic collision of the lower ball\nwith the upper ball. Note that here and in the following\nwe restrict ourselves to the situation where m1 > m2 .\nFor the opposite case, m1 < m2 , it may be shown that\nthe sketched sequence of collisions fails, even under the\nassumption of perfectly elastic collisions[1, 4].\nInelasticity of the balls is described by the coefficient\nof restitution which relates the precollisional relative velocity vij = vi \u2212 vj of colliding particles, i and j to the\n0\npost-collisional one, vij\n= vi0 \u2212 vj0 ,\n\u000e\n0\n\u03b5 = \u2212vij\nvij .\n\n(1)\n\nThe lower sphere (m1 ) reaches the floorqat time t10 =\nq\n(0)\n2 (0)\ng (z1 \u2212 R1 ) at the velocity v10 = \u2212 2g(z1 \u2212 R1 )\n0\n= \u2212\u03b5v10 . The first\nfrom where it is reflected with v10\nindex always denotes the considered particle and the second its collision-partner. Index 0 stands for the floor,\n1 for the lower and 2 for the upper sphere. Upper index (0) stands for initial values. Post-collisional values\nare marked by primes. The particles collide then at\nt12 = t10 \u2212 v10\u2206h\n(1+\u03b5) \u2261 t10 + \u2206t whereby the upper sphere\n(0)\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch of the problem.\n\n0\nis located at position z21 = z21\n= \u2212 21 gt212 + z2 with the\n(0)\n(0)\ninitial height z2 = z1 + R1 + R2 + \u2206h. At t12 the lower\n\n\f2\n0\nparticle has the velocity v12 = \u2212g\u2206t + v10\nand the upper\nv21 = \u2212gt12 . Employing the collision rule, Eq. (1), and\nconservation of momentum, we obtain the final velocities\n\nm2 v21 + m1 [v12 + \u03b5(v12 \u2212 v21 )]\nm1 + m2\nm1 v12 + m2 [v21 + \u03b5(v21 \u2212 v12 )]\n=\nm1 + m2\n\nv20 =\n\n(2)\n\nv10\n\n(3)\n\nand the relative velocity\nvr0 = v20 \u2212 v10 .\n\n(4)\n\nIn the case of elastic (\u03b5 = 1) and instantaneous (\u2206h \u2192 0)\ncollisions we find\n3\u2212\u03bc\n1+\u03bc\n1 \u2212 3\u03bc\n= \u2212v10\n.\n1+\u03bc\n\nv20 = \u2212v10\nv10\n\nwith\n\n\u03bc=\n\nm2\nm1\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nFor \u03bc = 1/3 the lower sphere loses all its kinetic energy\n(v10 = 0) and the upper sphere rebounds with twice its\ninitial velocity. In the limit \u03bc \u2192 0 we recover the well\nknown textbook result v20 = \u22123v10 , that is, the upper\nball rises to about nine times of its initial dropheight\n(0)\n(z2max = 9z2 \u2212 8(2R1 + R2 )).\nThe system of bouncing balls can be exhaustively described also for more than two spheres [5], provided the\ncollisions are considered as isolated events, that is, only\ntwo-particle interactions are taken into account.\n\nB.\n\nCoefficient of Restitution Resulting from the\nSolution of Newton's Equation\n\nThe contact of viscoelastic spheres is described by the\n(modified) Hertz contact law [6]. In this article we will\nuse a simplified force law since it allows for a exhaustive analytical solution of the problem. To justify this\napproximation, we will show later by means of numerical simulations that the more correct Hertz contact force\nleads to qualitatively identical results, see Appendix B.\nWe describe the contact of dissipatively interacting\nparticles, i and j, by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\ni\nF \u03beij , \u03be \u0307ij = min 0, \u2212k\u03beij \u2212 \u03b3 \u03be \u0307ij\n(7)\nas a function of the mutual compression\n\u03beij (t) = max [0, Ri + Rj \u2212 |~\nri (t) \u2212 r~j (t)|]\n\n(8)\n\nand the compression rate \u03be \u0307ij = d\u03beij (t)/dt, where Ri is\nthe radius of particle i and ~ri (t) is its position at time t.\nThe expression in square brackets in Eq. (7) may become\npositive during the expansion phase, that is, the (positive) dissipative force may overcompensate the (negative)\n\nelastic force which would lead to a resulting erroneous attractive force, see e.g. [7]. Therefore, the min[. . . ] function is applied to take into account that the interaction\nforce is always repulsive (negative).\nConsider an isolated pair of colliding particles i and j\n \u0307 = 0) at\napproaching one another at impact rate v = \u03be(t\nt = 0. Using the force, Eq. (7), we obtain the relative\nvelocity after a collision by solving Newton's equation of\nmotion,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n \u0308\n \u0307\nmeff\n(9)\nij \u03beij = F \u03beij , \u03beij ,\nwith the effective mass meff\nij = mi mj / (mi + mj ) and initial conditions \u03beij (0) = 0 and \u03be \u0307ij (0) = v. The collision is\ncomplete at time tc when \u03be \u0308ij (tc ) = 0 [7].\nOf course, for a pairwise collision the final velocity as\nobtained from Eq. (1) must coincide with the final velocity as obtained from integrating Newton's equation of\nmotion. Therefore, the solution \u03be \u0307ij (tc ) of Eq.

Thus, \u03b5 may\nnot be considered as a pure material constant.\nIII.\n\nSIMULTANEOUS CONTACTS\nA.\n\nEquations of Motion\n\nThe ICM fails if we take into account the finite duration of the collisions. In this case, it may happen that\n\n\f3\n\nthe collision of the particles (process b) starts yet before\nthe collision of the lower particle with the floor (process\na) has terminated. In this case we have a three-particle\ninteraction of the floor and both balls which cannot be\nresolved using the concept of the coefficient of restitution.\nIn this case, the final velocity of the upper particle must\nbe determined by integrating Newton's equation of motion for the three-particle system which requires the detailed knowledge of the interaction forces. Consequently,\nwe have to solve the set of Newton's equations\n\nThe latter assumption implies the somewhat unphysical fact that the lower side of the large sphere (where it\ncontacts the floor) is characterized by a larger dissipative\nconstant \u03b301 6= \u03b312 than its upper side (where it contacts\nthe smaller sphere). We will justify this assumption in\nApp. C where we show that the perhaps more plausible assumption \u03b301 = \u03b312 , implying \u03b501 6= \u03b512 , leads to\nqualitatively identical results.\nIV.\n\nm1 z\u03081 + m1 g + F12 \u2212 F01 = 0\nm2 z\u03082 + m2 g \u2212 F12 = 0 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Fij is the model-specific interaction law between\nparticles i and j and the floor is considered as particle 0\n(with m0 \u2192 \u221e).\nThe failure of the simplifying ICM was discussed in the\ncontext of the closely related problem of Newton's cradle.\nA simple analysis reveals immediately that the textbooklike explanation using isolated collisions is insufficient [8].\nInstead, the details of the interaction force must be taken\ninto account. The explanation of Newton's cradle is far\nfrom being simple and there is an intensive and controversial discussion about this seemingly simple classroom\nexperiment [9\u201316].\nThe necessity of considering the details of the interaction force becomes obvious immediately when considering colliding rods instead of spheres [17\u201319]. In fact, the\ninvestigation of longitudinal waves in colliding bodies and\nthe corresponding duration of the collision is a classical\nproblem of mechanics, investigated by some of the most\neminent scientists, such as Poisson [20], Boltzmann [21]\nand other important scientists [22\u201324]\n\nB.\n\nBASKETBALL \u2013 TENNIS BALL PROBLEM\nA.\n\nCollision Sequence\n\nLet us assume two vertically aligned balls (the basketball \u2013 tennis ball problem) as sketched in Fig. 1. We\nintegrate Newton's equation of motion, Eq. (14), for this\nsystem numerically and obtain the forces between the\nbottom and the lower sphere and between both spheres,\n(b)\n(e)\nsee Fig. 2. For time t01 \u2264 t \u2264 t01 the lower particle is in\n\nComparison with the ICM\n\nIn Sec. II B we conclude the coefficient of restitution\nfrom the interaction force. Using this result, we can compute the final relative velocity vr0 by means of Eq. (4),\nemploying the assumption of independent collisions. Alternatively we can obtain vr0 by solving the set of equations (14) numerically. The latter approach does not require any assumption on the sequence of the collisions.\nWe will see that both results may deviate considerably\naccording to rather complex dynamics of the system.\nIn order to compare both results by means of Eq. (13)\nwe map the constants of the force law to the coefficient\nof restitution (k, \u03b3, meff ) \u2194 \u03b5.\nWe assume that the collisions between the lower sphere\nand the floor (ij = 01) and between the spheres (ij = 12)\ntake place at the same coefficient of restitution. Since the\neffective mass enters Eq. (13), for given material stiffness,\nk = const., Eq. (13) then provides a relation between \u03b5\nand \u03b3ij , thus, we can determine \u03b3ij by specifying \u03b5 as a\ncontrol parameter of the problem.\n\nFIG. 2: Forces F01 and F12 obtained from solving Eqs. (14).\nDuring the contact between the lower particle and the floor\nthere occur multiple contacts between the spheres (full line).\nFor discussion see the text. Parameters: R1 = 10 cm, R2 =\n(0)\n1 cm, \u2206h = 0.1 mm, z1 = 0.6 m, k = 5.0 * 107 N/m, \u03b5 = 0.7\n(corresponding to hard rubber).\n\ncontact with the floor as indicated by the force F01 6= 0.\nDuring this interval the balls are in contact repeatedly,\n(b)\nstarting at time (first contact) t12 and ending (last con(e)\ntact) at time t12 as indicated by F12 6= 0. An interesting\n(b)\ndetail is the discontuity of F01 at t = t01 which is a\nconsequence of the force law, Eq. (7): At the instant of\nthe contact where \u03be01 \u2192 0, the elastically restoring term,\nk\u03be01 , vanishes whereas the (repulsive) dissipative term,\n\u03b3 \u03be \u030701 , has a finite value as soon as the particles get into\ncontact.\nThe existence of multiple collisions shown in Fig. 2\nshows that the ICM described in Sec. II fails for the cho-\n\n\f4\n\nsen set of parameters which provokes mainly two questions:\n1. How many contacts between the spheres occur and\nhow does their number depend on the system parameters (\u2206h, R1 , R2 , \u03b3ij or \u03b5 respectively)?\n2. If multiple collisions take place, when does the collision sequence terminate?\nDepending on the system parameters we may obtain\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\n(e)\nt12 \u2264 t01 or t12 > t01 , therefore, the second question\nmust be answered by a definition: The collision-sequence\nterminates at time t = tf (see Fig. 2) when the last contact between the spheres ceases, before the large sphere\ncollides with the floor for the second time.\nTo answer the first question, we refer to Fig. 3 which\nillustrates the sequence of collisions in dependence of the\ncoefficient of restitution \u03b5 for fixed \u2206h and R1 /R2 . The\n\nFIG. 3: Sequence of collisions for varying coefficient of restitution. The dashed line shows the end of the contact between\n(e)\nthe lower sphere and the floor, t01 . The fat line corresponds\nto the force drawn in Fig. 2 (R1 = 10 cm, R2 = 1 cm,\n(0)\n\u2206h = 0.1 mm, z1 = 0.6 m, k = 5.0 * 107 N/m).\n\nvalue of \u03b5 was adjusted by varying \u03b3, according to Eq.\n(13) while keeping k = 5.0 * 107 N/m invariant. Figure 3\nshould be read horizontally (for fixed value of \u03b5): each\nblack or grey line marks time intervals when the particles\nare in contact. For elastic balls, \u03b5 = 1, and the chosen\nparameters there occur 3 collisions. For sufficiently large\n\u2206h, this number may be unity, that is, the independentcollisions condition is fulfilled (see below). Keeping \u2206h,\nk and the radii R1 and R2 constant and decreasing \u03b5,\nthe number of contacts increases. This is due to the fact\nthat the relative velocity of the balls decreases because\nof inelastic collisions and, thus, the intervals of free flight\nbecome shorter while the duration of the contacts depends only weakly on the value of the inelasticity. For\nyet smaller \u03b5 the relative velocity after the k th contact\n\nmay be small enough such that the lower ball catches up\nwith the upper because of its upwards acceleration due\nto its contact with the floor. This effect makes some freeflight intervals vanish for decreasing \u03b5 and, thus, reduces\nthe number of contacts. Summarizing, for each set of\nparameters {\u2206h, R1 , R2 , k} the number of collisions as\na function of \u03b5 is a function with a single maximum.\nFor the force law Eq. (7) the basketball \u2013 tennis ball\nproblem may be solved analytically by a piecewise procedure, see App. A. To check against numerical errors,\nthe horizontal gray lines (in between the black lines) show\nthe same information as the result of an analytical theory\nwhich agrees perfectly with the numerical data.\nThere is an interesting case when the final velocity of\nthe lower ball after losing contact with the floor is only\nslightly larger than the velocity of the upper ball after\nthe previous collision. Since both balls move only under\nthe action of gravity, the balls may collide an ultimate\ntime even after the contact between the lower ball and\nthe floor has already finished. These events may be seen\nin Fig. 3 as narrow spikes at \u03b5 \u2248 0.78, \u03b5 \u2248 0.67, etc.\nThe number of contacts of the spheres as a function of\n\u03b5 and the initial distance \u2206h is shown in more detail in\nFigure 4 (top). As explained above for each value of \u03b5\nthere is an interval for \u2206h which maximizes the number\nof contacts.\nFor the interaction force, Eq. (7) the ratio tc,01 /tc,12 of\nthe contact duration of the collision lower sphere/ground\ntc,01 and the contact duration of the collision lower/upper\nsphere tc,12 increases with m1 /m2 (or R1 /R2 , respectively). Consequently, the number of contacts increases\nwith R1 /R2 , shown in Fig. 4 (bottom). On the other\nhand, increasing R1 /R2 also increases the initial relative\nvelocity between the two spheres and with that the intervalls of free flight, what in turn reduces the possible\nnumber of contacts. Whereas the effect explained first\nis dominating, the interplay of both effects explaines the\nrather complex behaviour shown in the bottom panel of\nFig. 4.\nFrom Figs. 3 and 4 we see that for a vast range of\nparameters the true collision scenario as obtained from\nthe integration of Newton's equations of motion deviates\ndrastically from the independent-collision scenario outlined in Sec. II.\n\nB.\n\nEffective Coefficient of Restitution\n\nBy solving Newton's equation, we can compute the\nfinal relative velocity vr0 = v2 (tf ) \u2212 v1 (tf ) which corresponds to Eq. (4) obtained from the ICM. To compare\nboth results, we compute vr0 by integrating Eq. (14) using\nthe interaction force Eq. (7) for a certain set of parameters {\u2206h, m1 , m2 , k} and a specified \u03b5 = \u03b5spec (which in\nturn determines \u03b3 via Eq. (13)). Then, by inverting Eq.\n(4) we determine the coefficient of restitution \u03b5 = \u03b5eff\nwhich would yield the same final relative velocity for the\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 4: Number of contacts between the spheres as a function\nof \u03b5 and \u2206h (top) and \u03b5 and R1 /R2 (bottom). The dashed\nlines show the value of \u2206h and R1 /R2 used in Fig. 3; the\n+ symbol shows the parameters used in Fig. 2. The solid\nline in the lower panel indicates R1 /R2 = 1. (Parameters:\nk = 5.0 * 107 N/m, R1 = 10cm and R2 = 1cm (top) and\nk = 5.0 * 107 N/m, R2 = 1cm and \u2206h = 0.1mm (bottom))\n\nICM. If \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec \u2248 1, both models yield the same result, that is, the ICM is an acceptable approximation.\nOtherwise, the ICM fails.\nConsider the dependence of \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec on the initial distance \u2206h. For large \u2206h the lower sphere leaves the floor\nbefore it contacts the upper one, that is, the ICM holds\ntrue. Figure 5 (top) shows that \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec \u2192 1 with increasing \u2206h. Moreover, as expected for \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec \u2192 1\nthere is only one contact which is a necessary (but not\nsufficient) precondition for independent collisions. Figure\n5 (bottom) is a magnification of the range of small \u2206h.\nAs discussed before, the number of contacts as a function\nof \u2206h has a maximum. The oscillations in the number\nof contacts as a function of \u2206h for very small \u2206h correspond to the spikes shown in Fig. 3 where the lower\nsphere catches up with the upper after the lower sphere\nhas already left the ground.\nSimilarly, Fig. 6 shows \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec as a function of\nR1 /R2 . Since increasing R1 /R2 increases the number of\ncontacts, \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec decreases and thus, as expected, the\n\nFIG. 5: \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec as a function of \u2206h and the corresponding\nnumber of contacts (right axis, top). The bottom figure shows\na magnification of the small \u2206h range. Parameters: R1 =\n10cm, R2 = 1cm, k = 5.0 * 107 N/m, \u03b5spec = 0.9.\n\nFIG. 6: \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec as a function of R1 /R2 (with R2 = 1cm) and\nthe corresponding number of contacts (right axis). Further\nparameters: k = 5.0 * 107 N/m, \u03b5spec = 0.8, \u2206h = 0.1mm.\n\nICM invalidates with increasing R1 /R2 .\nWhile for most values of the parameter space\n\u03b5eff /\u03b5spec < 1, there is a small interval of R1 /R2 where\n\n\f6\n\n\u03b5eff /\u03b5spec > 1 (inset in Fig, 6) which is a deviation\nfrom the ICM too. Here, because of the similar durations of the contact upper sphere/lower sphere and lower\nsphere/floor, the lower sphere still being in contact with\nfloor pushes the upper one upward. As far as we see, this\nis the only (tiny) effect which allows for \u03b5eff > \u03b5spec .\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe considered the motion of two vertically aligned\nspheres which are released to collide with the floor under\nthe action of gravity. For the analysis of the dynamics\nof this textbook problem (basketball \u2013 tennis ball problem) we used two complementary methods. First we described the system exploiting the independent collision\nmodel (ICM) which assumes instantaneous collisions between the spheres and between the lower sphere and the\nfloor. The collisions are described by a single number, the\ncoefficient of restitution, \u03b5, and the duration of the collisions is neglected. Second, we described the dynamics by\nanalytically and numerically solving Newton's equation\nof motion. Here the collisions are characterized by an\n \u0307 For the case of the linear\ninteraction force law, F (\u03be, \u03be).\ndashpot model used here, the force is a function of the\nelastic and dissipative parameters k and \u03b3. Since there\nis a direct relation between \u03b5 and {k, \u03b3}, we can compare the results of the ICM and the solution of Newton's\nequations.\nWe specify two characteristics of the process, a) the\nfinal relative velocity, v 0 , between the spheres and b) the\nnumber of collisions between the spheres during the process. If the approaches were equivalent, we should obtain\nequivalent results for a) and b).\nObviously, in case of the ICM there is only one collision between the spheres and the final result for v 0 is the\nsolution of a textbook problem, Eq. 4. In the article we\nshow that Newton's equations yield a different scenario,\nincluding multiple collisions and the ICM is only valid in\na certain limit, that is, the ICM fails for a wide range of\nparameters.\nTo quantify the deviations, we solve Newton's equations with parameters k and \u03b3 that correspond to a certain specified coefficient of restitution \u03b5 = \u03b5spec . Then we\ncompare this value with the effective coefficient of restitution, \u03b5eff , obtained from the final relative velocity as obtained from Newton's equation. The value \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec = 1\nwould indicate that both models agree. Our results reveal, however, a dramatic deviation from this ideal behavior. In Figs. 5 and 6 we see that in contradiction to\nthe ICM, the ratio \u03b5eff /\u03b5spec may adopt any value from\nalmost zero up to slightly larger than one, that is, the\nICM fails dramatically.\nWhile our subject, the basketball \u2013 tennis Ball problem, is only a cute but relatively unimportant toy problem, our results may have serious consequences for numerical simulation techniques of granular many-particle\n\nproblems. There exist two established simulation techniques for the simulation of granular systems, Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Event-driven Molecular Dynamics (EMD). While MD solves Newton's equations of motion for all N particles constituting the granular system,\nthus, solves a system of 3N (without rotation) coupled,\nstrongly non-linear differential equations, EMD describes\nthe dynamics of the N -particle system as a sequence of\npairwise collisions. The latter approach allows for a great\nspeedup of the numerical simulation since instead of solving computer-time intensive solutions of differential equations, we only have to compute postcollisional velocities\nfrom the precollisional ones, as a function of the coefficient of restitution for each pair of colliding particles,\n{~vi , ~vj , \u03b5} \u2192 {~vi0 , ~vj0 } via a simple propagation function.\nIn between the collisions the particles follow simple ballistic trajectories.\nIt is obvious, that EMD allows for very efficient simulations as compared with MD, in particular for large\nN \u223c 106 . . . 108 , however, this speedup comes for the\nprice of the assumption of independent collisions, that\nis, EMD assumes instantaneous collisions neglecting the\nduration of the collisions. While this assumption may be\njustified in a granular gas where the mean free flight time\nis large as compared to the typical duration of collisions,\nit fails for dense systems. Our simple one-dimensional,\n3-particle system shows that the failure may be dramatic.\nFor the analytical calculations presented in this article we made two major assumptions whose justification\nmight not be obvious beforehand: First we assumed a\nlinear-dashpot force, Eq. 7, for the interaction of viscoelastic spheres. This force allows for a simple mapping\nof the constants k and \u03b5 to the coefficient of restitution\nwhich is, moreover, a constant in this case. Of course, the\ninteraction of spheres is described by a (modified) Hertz\nlaw which leads to a impact velocity dependent \u03b5. We\ncould perform the entire calculation presented here also\nfor the Hertz law, however, at a much larger mathematical effort (see [25] for a similar calculation). We prefer\nhere the simplified force and demonstrate in Appendix B\nthat the Hertz law leads to qualitatively identical results.\nThe second simplification concerns the assumption of\na universal coefficient of restitution for the description of\nthe collisions between the particles and between the lower\nparticle and the floor. Since the effective mass enters the\nmapping between the force constants and \u03b5, the assumption of a universal \u03b5 implies that the lower sphere is characterized by a certain set of parameters {k, \u03b3} when colliding with the floor, but by a different set of parameters\nwhen colliding with the upper sphere. The alternative\nassumption of invariant material parameters is, perhaps,\nmore plausible but leads then to different values of the\ncoefficient of restitution for particle-particle and particlefloor collisions. While these alternative assumptions lead,\nof course, to different results, in Appendix C we demonstrate that the qualitative properties of the dynamics are\nthe same for both assumptions.\n\n\f7\n\nAppendix A: Analytical description\n\nFor an approximative analytical description, we assume that the motion of the large ball is not affected by\nthe small ball. This adiabatic approximation becomes\nexact for R1 \u001d R2 and Eqs. (14) decouple and may\nbe solved piecewise. We obtain four different types of\ncollective motion:\nType A): The balls are isolated from one another and\nfrom the floor. Here the particles move along ballistic\ntrajectories\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nz1,free (t) = \u2212gt2 /2 + v1 t + z1\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nz2,free (t) = \u2212gt2 /2 + v2 t + z2 .\n\n(A1)\n\nType D): The balls are in contact with each other but not\nwith the floor. Here the lower sphere follows a ballistic\ntrajectory disregarding the force resulting form the contact with the upper one (adiabatic approximation) and\nthe upper sphere moves as described in type C) but now\ndriven by the motion z1,free (t) of the lower sphere:\nm2 z\u03082 = \u2212m2 g + k2 [R1 + R2 \u2212 (z2 \u2212 z1,free )]\n\u2212 \u03b32 (\u017c2 \u2212 \u017c1,free ) . (A5)\nAgain we do not provide the lengthy but straightforward\nsolution z2,air (t) of Eq. (A5) here.\nWe keep in mind that balls i and j (with i = 0 representing the floor) are in contact if the mutual compression\n\u03beij is positive and the interaction force Fij is repulsive.\nThen we obtain the analytical solution of the problem,\nz1 (t) and z2 (t), from combining the analytical solutions\nof the cases A-D by means of the following scheme:\n\nIn our notation vi and zi stand for the positions and\nvelocities of the particles at the instant when the system\nenters a type of motion for the k th time, that is, they are\ninitial conditions of the piecewise analytical solution.\n\n1.

IV\nare more than just artifacts of the simplified interaction\nforce Eq. (7). The reason of the deviation of the effective coefficient of restitution from the specified coefficient\n\n\f8\n\nshown in Figs. 5 and 6 are the described multiple collisions arising from the finite duration of the collisions.\nTherefore, here we show that multiple collisions also appear for the much more realistic interaction force Eq.\n(B1). To this end we reproduce Fig. 3 where the time\nintervals of particle contacts are shown in dependence of\nthe (specified) coefficient of restitution.\n1.\n\nh\ni\np\nF (\u03beij , \u03be \u0307ij )\n3/2\n \u0307ij ,\n=\nmin\n0,\n\u2212k\u03be\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\u2212\n\u03b3\nij\nij\nmeff\nij\n\n(B1)\n\nwith\n\u03c1\u2261\n\nq\n\neff\nRij\n\n3 (1 \u2212\n\n2.\n\nBasketball \u2013 Tennis Ball Problem for\nViscoelastic Balls\n\nViscoelastic Spheres\n\nThe force law, Eq. (7), is convenient as it leads to\na coefficient of restitution, Eq. (13), in an elementary\nway. However, this force law is a strong simplification.\nPerhaps the simplest particle interaction model which is\nnot in conflict with basic mechanics of materials, is the\ncontact of viscoelastic spheres, i and j [6], given by\n\n2Y\n\nh2 = \u22121.153, h3 = 0, h4 = 0.798, h5 = 0.267, . . . (see [25]\nfor the numerical values hk ). Note that in contrast to the\nprevious case, Eq. (13), here the coefficient of restitution\ndepends on the impact velocity v.\n\n\u03bd2)\n\n, k\u2261\n\n3 \u03c1A\n\u03c1\n, \u03b3\u2261\n,\neff\n2 meff\nmij\nij\n\n(B2)\n\nthe Young modulus Y , the Poisson ratio \u03bd, the effeceff\ntive radius Rij\n= Ri Rj / (Ri + Rj ) and the effective mass\neff\nmij = mi mj / (mi + mj ). Again we use the mutual compression and the compression rate to describe the contact\ndynamics (see Eq. (8)). The dissipative constant A is a\nfunction of the material viscosity; see [6] for details. For\nelastic spheres, A = 0, we recover the classical Hertz\ncontact force [26].\nA necessary prerequisite for deriving Hertz's law of\ncontact and its generalization to viscoelastic spheres, Eq.\n(B1), is the assumption of small particle deformation,\nthat is, the interaction force causes only local displacements in the region of the contact area. Moreover, the\nimpact rate must be small as compared to the speed of\nsound to allow for a quasistatic approximation, see [6].\nMore complex deformations including surface waves and\noscillations, e.g. [27], are not considered here. Such oscillations may also give rise to multiple collisions between\nparticles and yet more complicated particle-particle interaction.\nThe relation between the coefficient of restitution and\nthe parameters of the force law, corresponding to Eq.\n(13), may also be obtained for the case of viscoelastic\nspheres. The calculation is cumbersome [25, 28] (a simplified version is based on a dimension analysis [29]), here\nwe present only the result:\n\u03b5(v) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nhk \u03b2 k/2 v k/10 ,\n\n(B3)\n\nk=0\n\nwith the initial conditions \u03beij (0) = 0, \u03be \u0307ij (0) = v and\nwith \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b3k \u22123/5 and the pure numbers h0 = 1, h1 = 0,\n\nJust as in Sec. IV we use the coefficient of restitution \u03b5\nto characterize the system's dissipative properties, due to\nthe dissipative constant A in the force law, Eq. (B1). We\nproceed on the lines of Sec. IV A: We specify \u03b5, the Young\neff\nmodulus Y , the poisson ratio \u03bd, the effective radius Rij\neff\nand mass mij and solve Eq. (B3) numerically for the\ndissipative parameter A. Additionally, we specify the\ninitial velocity vin = 3 m/s since for the viscoelastic force\nlaw the coefficient of restitution depends on the impact\nrate. As in Sec. IV, the assumption of a universal value\nof the coefficient of restitution to describe both particleparticle and particle-floor contact results in the rather\nartificial fact that the spheres cannot consist of the same\nmaterial. This assumption is necessary to use the quite\ndescriptive quantity \u03b5 as a control parameter. In App.\nC we will release this assumption and show that it does\nnot qualitative change the system's behavior.\nFigure 7 shows the sequence of collisions, corresponding to Fig. 3 for the linear-dashpot force. The figures\nreveal the same structure of the collision scenario, that\nis, the viscoelastic force, Eq. (B1), leads to qualitatively\nthe same results as the linear-dashpot model and, thus,\njustifies application of the simplified force Eq. (7) in Sec.\nIV.\n\nFIG. 7: Same as Fig. 3 but for viscoelastic spheres. Parameters: (R1 = 10cm, R2 = 0.25cm, \u2206h = 0.1mm,\nY = 5.0 * 107 N/m2 , \u03bd = 0.45).

Thus, we can no\nlonger use \u03b5 as characteristic value. Instead, to characterize the interaction we use the dissipative material\nparameter A which enters the force law, Eq. (B1).\n\nThe sequence of collisions shown in Fig. 3 has the same\nstructure as for the assumption of a universal coefficient\nof restitution with only minor quantitative differences.\nStill there occur multiple collisions and consequently the\neffects described in Sec. IV persist. Hence the assumption of a universal coefficient of restitution is justified.\n\nwork?, Am. J. Phys. 50, 977 (1982).\n[12] J. C. Piquette and M.-S.
