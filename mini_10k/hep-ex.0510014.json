An extensive collection\nof figures of data is given here. Also technical points of discrepancies between\nanalyses are discussed in detail. A section involving these technical points is\ndenoted by an asterix.\nThis work has been assisted greatly by a working group on Scalars, established at Hadron05. I am grateful to the large number of contributors to\nthis working group. Opinions have frequently differed, so the responsibility\nis mine for trying to arrive at a consensus; at several points I need to explore\nconflicts of opinion and sometimes try to reach a conclusion.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThe \u03c3 pole\n\nEarly evidence for the \u03c3 pole arose from elastic scattering data. Markushin\nand Locher [1] summarise many determinations. Renewed interest was sparked\noff by E791 data on D + \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 + [2]. The \u03c0\u03c0 mass projection, shown in\nFig. 1, has a low mass peak which was fitted by a pole shown in the first entry\nof Table 1 below. Their fit assumed a Breit-Wigner resonance\nq with \u0393(s) \u221d\n\u221a\n\u03c1(s), where \u03c1(s) is Lorentz invariant phase space 2k/ s = 1 \u2212 4m2\u03c0 /s and\nk is centre of mass momentum. This choice for \u0393(s) will later be shown to\nbe inappropriate, but correcting it to a better form introduces only changes\nof detail. Oller has refitted the data in a way consistent with Chiral Perturbation Theory; there is some increase in the width of the pole [3].\n\nFigure 1: The \u03c0\u03c0 mass projection of E791 data for D + \u2192 \u03c0 + (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ), (a)\nwithout, (b) with \u03c3 in the fit.\n\nHigher statistics data from BES II [4] on J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are shown in\nFig. 2. They are dominated by f2 (1270), b1 (1235) and \u03c3, which is clearly\nvisible as a flat band along the upper right-hand edge of the Dalitz plot in\n(b). The 0+ contribution is shown in (e). There is a marginal 2 standard\ndeviation contribution from f0 (980). In order to test the sensitivity of the\nextrapolation to the pole, four types of parametrisation were tried. All are\nconsistent with an average pole position M = (541 \u00b1 39) \u2212 i(252 \u00b1 42) MeV.\n\n3\n\nHow to parametrise the \u03c3\n\nFig. 3(a) shows the intensity of \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering v. mass.

They proposed that massless \u03c0\nof zero momentum have zero elastic amplitude. If the I = 0 S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\namplitude is expanded as a power series f = am2\u03c0 + bk 2 , consistency between\ns, t and u channels requires f \u221d (s \u2212 0.5m2\u03c0 ) and a zero at the Adler point\nsA = 0.5m2\u03c0 . Fig. 3(b) shows the result of dividing Fig. 3(a) by (s \u2212 sA )2 .\nInstantly one sees a resemblance with the \u03c3 peak of Fig. 2. So the solution\nto the puzzle is that the matrix element for \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering is strongly\ns-dependent: a situation unlike most other resonances.\n\nFigure 3: (a) The \u03c0\u03c0 intensity in elastic scattering, (b) with the Adler zero\ndivided out.\nLet us write the elastic \u03c3 amplitude as\nTel00 = (\u03b7 exp(2i\u03b4) \u2212 1)/2i\nN(s)\nNel (s)\n=\n= 2\n.\nD(s)\nM \u2212 s \u2212 iNtot (s)\n\n(1)\n\nHere Nel (s) is real for s \u2265 0. The phase variation comes purely from D(s);\nthis denominator is universal for all processes involving a \u03c0\u03c0 pair. [That is\nthe assumption on which the Particle Data Tables are based]. For elastic\nscattering, the Adler zero in N(s) nearly cancels the \u03c3 pole for low masses.\nHowever, the numerator N(s) is not universal; it is quite different for production processes, where the left-hand cut is distant. Later, it will be shown\nthat E791 data for D + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + require N(s)prodn = 1 within errors.\nThe production amplitude will therefore be written\n00\nTprodn\n= \u039b/D(s),\n\nwhere \u039b is a complex coupling constant.\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fFigure 4: Contours of intensity for (a) production, (b) elastic scattering.\n\nFig. 4 sketches contours of constant intensity for (a) production, (b)\nelastic scattering. In the latter case, the effect of the Adler zero is to suppress\nthe intensity near s = 0. The elastic phase shift on the real s axis (where\nexperiments are done) reaches 90\u25e6 only at M > 900 MeV, far above the\nposition of the pole. It is this feature which confuses many people. However,\nthe phase varies rapidly off the real axis because the width increases with s\nand because of consequent effects of analyticity.\nA simultaneous fit is made to BES II data, Ke4 [6] and Cern-Munich data\n[7] using the empirical form:\nN(s) = M(s \u2212 0.5m2\u03c0 ) exp[\u2212(s \u2212 M 2 )/A](1 + \u03b2s)\u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 (s) + M\u03934\u03c0 (s).\n\n(3)\n\nThe exponential is required by \u03c0\u03c0 elastic data to cut off N(s) above 1 GeV.\nThe term M\u03934\u03c0 accounts for 4\u03c0 inelasticity above \u223c 1 GeV, but has little\neffect on the \u03c3 pole. Note from Fig. 2(e) that the \u03c3 intensity fitted to BES\ndata falls to a low value above 1 GeV. The \u03c3 pole is therefore distinct from\nthe broad f0 (1535) fitted by Anisovich et al. [8]. It is also distinct from the\nbroad pole fitted around 1 GeV by Au, Morgan and Pennington [9].\nBelow the KK threshold, the elastic amplitude must follow the unitarity\ncircle. There are small contributions from the low mass tails of f0 (1370),\nf0 (1500), etc. and a contribution from f0 (980) which is large around 1 GeV.\nThese are included by writing\n00\nT\u03c0\u03c0\n= (S\u03c3 S980 S1370 S1500 \u2212 1)/(2i),\n\n5\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere S is the S-matrix \u03b7 exp(2i\u03b4) = 2i(1 + T ) for each individual resonance.\nBelow the KK threshold, \u03b7 = 1 for all amplitudes, so phases due to individual\nresonances add.\nFor production, there are hundreds of open channels for D and J/\u03a8 decays. Within individual channels, unitarity plays a negligible role. In the\nstandard isobar model, amplitudes are added using a complex coupling constant \u039b = g exp(i\u03c60 ) for each amplitude; the phase \u03c60 is constant over the\nwhole Dalitz plot. For J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c3, \u03c60 is the phase of \u03c3\u03c9 elastic scattering at\nthe J/\u03a8 mass; it is unknown, so g and \u03c60 need to be fitted to the data.\nThe Ke4 data are available up to 380 MeV and there is then a gap in\nelastic scattering data until 560 MeV, where Cern-Munich data begin. The\n\u03c3 pole lies in the mass range where there are no elastic data. Although this\ngap may be bridged by using dispersion relations, the production data are\nobviously important in filling the gap directly.\n\n4\n\nThe phase of the \u03c3\n\nIn the BES data, the b1 \u03c0 channel contributes 41% intensity and \u03c3\u03c9 19%.\nThere are strong interferences between them which determine the phase variation of the \u03c3 with mass. The data have been divided into bins 100 MeV\nwide from 400 to 1000 MeV. Fig. 5 shows phases for individual bins, keeping\nmagnitudes fixed at values from the global fit: this achieves optimum accuracy, since there is noise in the magnitude in individual bins if it is set free.\nThe full curve shows the phase from elastic scattering data. The agreement\nwith the bin-by-bin fit shows that the Breit-Wigner form of eqn. (1) indeed\naccounts for the phase in all data. The implication is that the data at low\nmass may be described by a single resonance, except for well understood\ncontributions from f0 (980), f0 (1370) and f0 (1500). It is not necessary to\ninclude a background amplitude. Another way of stating this is that if any\nbackground is present, it is the same in both elastic scattering and production and may be absorbed algebraically into the parametrisation of the \u03c3\namplitude.\nWithin the scalar working group, it has been suggested that phases could\nbe modified by rescattering of pions from \u03c3 decay off the \u03c9; although this\nmust happen at some level, its contribution seems to be below the level of\nexperimental errors at present.\n6\n\n\fFigure 5: The phase of the \u03c3 amplitude in mass bins 100 MeV wide, compared\nwith the global fit (full curve), a Breit-Wigner of constant width (dashed)\nand a Breit-Wigner with \u0393 \u221d \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 (dotted).\nThe dotted curve of Fig. 5 shows the phase variation if the amplitude for\nthe \u03c3 is expressed in the form \u0393 \u221d \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 . This gives a marginally poorer fit, but\ncannot be distinguished cleanly using the BES data. Unfortunately, the b1\nband runs off the corner of the Dalitz plot and does not interfere significantly\nwith the \u03c3 below 400 MeV.\n\n5\n\nTheory\n\nIt is important to realise that there is a large background of theoretical work\non elastic scattering and related processes like \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 KK.\nColangelo, Gasser and Leutwyler [10] have made a precise determination\nof the \u03c3 pole from elastic scattering and Ke4 data without using production\ndata. They use crossing symmetry to calculate the amplitude on the left-hand\ncut (s < 0) from amplitudes at s > 4m2\u03c0 (right-hand cut). For a given s and\nt, the two are related by a simple isospin matrix; the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave amplitudes\nis then evaluated from an integration over the appropriate range of t (and\nlikewise for P and D-waves, including appropriate Legendre polynomials).\nAs a further constraint, they use fixed t dispersion relations (Roy equations).\n7\n\n\fState\n\nReference\n\nData\n\n\u03c3\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[10]\n[13]\n[25]\n[27]\n[30]\n[32]\n[31]\n[36]\nhere\n[3]\n[12]\n[14]\n[15]\n[24]\n[37]\n[12]\n[39]\n\nD + \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 +\nD + \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 +\nJ/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c9(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\n\u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\nD + \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 +\nD + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 +\nJ/\u03a8 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 +\nJ/\u03a8 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 +\nK\u03c0 \u2192 K\u03c0\nall\n+\nD \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 +\nK\u03c0 \u2192 K\u03c0\nK\u03c0 \u2192 K\u03c0\nK\u03c0 \u2192 K\u03c0\nK\u03c0 \u2192 K\u03c0\nJ/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\n\u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and KK\np\u0304p \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c9\u03b7\u03c0 0\n\n\u03ba\n\nf0 (980)\na0 (980)\n\nPole position\n(MeV)\n(489 \u00b1 26) \u2212 i(173 \u00b1 26)\n470 \u2212 i220\n(541 \u00b1 39) \u2212 i(252 \u00b1 42)\n(470 \u00b1 30) \u2212 i(295 \u00b1 20)\n445 \u2212 i221\n(470 \u00b1 50) \u2212 i(285 \u00b1 50)\n(455 \u00b1 36) \u2212 i(190 \u00b1 36)\n(721 \u00b1 61) \u2212 i(292 \u00b1 131)\n(760 \u00b1 41) \u2212 i(420 \u00b1 75)\n(841 \u00b1 82) \u2212 i(309 \u00b1 87)\n(722 \u00b1 60) \u2212 i(386 \u00b1 50)\n750+30\n\u221255 \u2212 i(342 \u00b1 60)\n710 \u2212 i310\n(770 \u2212 i(250 \u2212 425)\n(708 \u2212 i305)\n(753 \u2212 i235)\n(594 \u00b1 79) \u2212 i(362 \u00b1 322)\n(998 \u00b1 4) \u2212 i(17 \u00b1 4)\n994 - i14\n(1036 \u00b1 5) \u2212 i(84 \u00b1 9)\n\nTable 1: Summary of pole positions.\n\nThis extends greatly the range of s in which the S-wave is known and fixes the\n00\nI = 0 and 2 scattering lengths accurately. In this work, Re T\u03c0\u03c0\nis accurately\ndetermined and contains a very clear Adler zero at s = 0.45m2\u03c0\u03c0 (displaced\nby a tiny amount from Weinberg's prediction because of higher powers of k).\nThe published work fits \u03c0\u03c0 masses up to 800 MeV and demands a \u03c3 pole at\nM = (470 \u00b1 30) \u2212 i(295 \u00b1 20) MeV, i.e. about 2 standard deviations from the\nBES experimental value. Further work is in progress, to extend the fitted\nmass range to 1150 MeV, above f0 (980) and the KK threshold.\nIn a series of papers [11-16], Oset, Oller, Pelaez and collaborators have\nfitted data using 'unitarised' Chiral Perturbation Theory. In outline, they\n8\n\n\fuse ChPT for lowest order and take rescattering from the next order. They\nsuccessfully fit not only the I = 0 S-wave, but also reproduce the repulsive\nI = 2 S-wave. Their pole positions are given in Table 1.\nSchechter's group has also contributed a series of papers on all of \u03c3, \u03ba,\nf0 (980) and a0 (980) [17\u201321]. This work examines possible mixing between\n2-quark and 4-quark states.\nZheng and collaborators at Peking University have developed new types\nof dispersion relations and have applied them to analysis of data on the \u03c3\nand \u03ba [22\u201325]. In particular,\n\u221a they clarify how unphysical sub-threshold poles\ncan originate from the 1/ s dependence of phase space factors; they also\nshow that a pole is possible without the phase shift reaching 90\u25e6 , as may well\nhappen in K\u03c0 scattering. Thirdly, in Ref. 25, they repeat the analysis of\nColangelo et al. with different dispersion relations fitting the left-hand cut;\nthey confirm the necessity for the \u03c3 pole.\n\n6\n\nK-matrix fits\n\n\u2217\n\nFocus data on D + \u2192 3\u03c0 exhibit a similar low mass peak to E791 data [26]. If\nit is fitted with a Breit-Wigner with \u0393 \u221d \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 , there is a pole at M = (455 \u00b1\n36) \u2212 i(190 \u00b1 36) MeV [27]. However, Focus show that their data can also be\nfitted with a K-matrix parametrisation of Anisovich and Sarantsev [28] which\ndoes not include a \u03c3 pole. This provides an escape route for those who do\nnot wish to believe in the \u03c3 pole. The Babar collaboration has likewise found\nthat their data can be fitted by the same K-matrix parametrisation [29]. This\npoint requires some detailed and (unfortunately) critical comments.\nThere are several problems. The K-matrix parametrisation includes low\nmass poles at \u223c 600 and 1200 MeV and at s = \u22123 GeV2 . Focus report their\nparametrisation fully, so it is straightforward to follow details of the fit.\nThe first point is that the low mass region is being fitted by 3 poles instead\nof 1. This introduces large flexibility into the fit.\nThe second point is that the pole below threshold plays a major role,\nbut is questionable. If it is a zero of D(s), it is a very deeply bound state\nwhich is more questionable than the \u03c3. A more likely interpretation is a\npole of N(s). However, the N function is different for \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering\nand production reactions. So there is no reason to think that a pole fitted\nto elastic scattering will be appropriate to production. Furthermore, the N\n9\n\n\ffunction is normally interpreted as providing driving forces which generate\nthe amplitudes on the right-hand cut, e.g. resonances. Including them as\nspecific poles in searching for resonances looks like double-counting.\nThere is a third problem. In the K-matrix approach, \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering\nbelow the KK threshold is fitted not only by K11 (i.e. \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0) but also\nby the analytic continuation of K12 below the KK threshold. In the case of\nD decays, this corresponds to D \u2192 (KK)\u03c0, followed by KK rescattering to\n\u03c0\u03c0. This component should be constrained to reproduce data on D \u2192 KK\u03c0\nabove threshold; however, that has not been done.\nIn K-matrix fits to \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering below the KK threshold, I know\nfrom personal experience that there is \u221a\nlarge cross-talk between K11 and K12 .\nK12 increases below threshold as |k|/ s where |k| is the magnitude of the\nvirtual momentum in the KK channel. The increasing K12 as s \u2192 0 looks\nnot unlike a \u03c3 pole. The extrapolation below KK threshold is reliable only\nclose to threshold. In the Flatt\u00e9 formula for f0 (980), as an example, it\nplays an important role in contributing to the real part of the amplitude\nnear resonance. However, far from threshold the extrapolation is hazardous.\nThis is a general problem which has been seen elsewhere. For example, in\ncalculations of charmonium levels, open charm states with large decay widths\nperturb energy levels by major amounts.\nMy view is that there is a stabilising factor which needs to be brought into\nplay. It is common experience that form factors play a role above threshold\nwith a radius of order 0.6\u20130.8 fm. If such a form factor is needed above\nthreshold, the analytic continuation below threshold breaks down because\nit depends critically on the imaginary part of the amplitude extending to\ninfinity. With a form factor, the continuation below threshold can instead\nbe done using a dispersion integral:\n1\nRe K12 (s) =\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nIm K12 (s\u2032 )ds\u2032\ns\u2032 \u2212 s\n\n(5)\n\nI have carried out calculations along these lines. The form factor gives Im K12\na localised peak close to threshold and the result is that Re K12 drops fairly\nrapidly below threshold. In practice, it falls below threshold with a form\nsimilar to the fall-off above threshold, e.g. exp(\u2212\u03b1|k|2 ). This behaviour is\ntotally different from the analytic continuation without a form factor, and\ncan easily lead to an order of magnitude reduction in Re K12 by the time\none reaches the position of the \u03c3 pole. Focus show in their Figs. 7 and 8, the\n10\n\n\fmagnitudes they fit to sub-threshold KK, 4\u03c0, \u03b7\u03b7 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 amplitudes; all are\nvery large compared with fitted values of these amplitudes above threshold,\ntypically by one to two orders of magnitude. It seems physically unreasonable\nthat channels like \u03b7\u03b7 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 , which are quite small in the physical region,\nshould make large sub-threshold contributions.\nPutting this point in a different way, why stop at the 4\u03c0 channel above\nthreshold? Why not include an infinity of open channels at high mass: 6\u03c0,\n8\u03c0, . . . 100\u03c0 . . . This leads to the possibility of fitting all mesons resonances\nas interferences between an infinity of distant high-mass singularities. This\ncontradicts the conventional view that low mass peaks may be attributed to\nnearby singularities unless there is a specific convincing alternative.\nMy impression is that the K-matrix is dependable above threshold, where\nit is fitted directly to data on the inelastic channels. But below threshold, it\nintroduces excessive flexibility. What is urgently needed is to constrain it to\nfit the left-hand cut as well, following the work of Colangelo et al.\nConversely, a criticism of published fits based on the T-matrix is that they\nignore sub-threshold contributions from 4\u03c0, KK and \u03b7\u03b7. A more rigorous\nexpression for the Breit-Wigner denominator of eqn. (1) is\nD(s) = M 2 \u2212 s \u2212 m(s) \u2212 iNtot (s)\nZ\nM2 \u2212 s\nNtot (s\u2032 )ds\u2032\nm(s) =\n.\n\u03c0\n(s\u2032 \u2212 s)(M 2 \u2212 s\u2032 )\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nIn work not yet published, I have used this full form. It takes account of\nthe opening of the inelastic channels and also the effect of the dispersive\ncontribution in eqn. (3) to Re K11 . The detailed parameters of the fit\nchange, but effects on the position of the \u03c3 pole are within the presently\nquoted errors. The essential reason for this is that the BES data define the\nposition and width of the peak unambiguously. What happens is that the\nadditional term m(s) in the denominator is accomodated by corresponding\nchanges in the already flexible form of N(s).\n\n7\n\nThe \u03ba pole\n\nE791 data on D + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + provided the first evidence for the \u03ba pole\nfrom production data [30].

A combined fit to these and other data will be shown\nbelow.\nNext, BES II data on J/\u03a8 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 + provide further evidence for\nthe \u03ba in the channel J/\u03a8 \u2192 K \u2217 (890)\u03ba [31,32]. The scatter plot and mass\nprojections are shown in Fig. 6; histograms show the fit. There are clear\npeaks due to K \u2217 (890), K0,2 (1430), \u03c1(770), \u03c1(1270), K1 (1270 + 1400) and\nK1 (1770). If one selects K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 pairs within 50 MeV of 892 MeV, the mass\nprojection of the other K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 pair is shown in panel (f). A broad K\u03c0 S-wave\ncomponent is visible under the K \u2217 (890). Fig. 7 shows the effect of factoring\nout K\u03c0 phase space in the 4-body system. There is a broad peak below 750\nMeV, which is fitted as the \u03ba signal.\nData over the whole of phase space are fitted. Full details are given in\nRef. [32]. The fit is made simultaneously to BES data and LASS data [33]\non the K\u03c0 I = 1/2 S-wave. Eqn. (1) is used with\n\u221a\nN(s) = M(s \u2212 sA ) exp(\u2212\u03b1 s)\u03c1K\u03c0 (s)\n(8)\nwith sA = m2K \u221a\n\u2212 0.5m2\u03c0 .

There\nis destructive interference between \u03ba and K0 (1430); their coherent sum is\nshown by the dashed histogram in Fig. 8(c). Sensitivity to this interference\nis one reason for fitting the LASS data simultaneously; it is absent in those\ndata, where the phases of the two components add. A second reason is to\nexamine whether eqn. (8) fits both sets of data successfully.\nSince K1 decays populate the low mass K\u03c0 range, it is essential to demonstrate that K1 decays do not reproduce the \u03ba peak. Omitting the \u03ba leads to\na fit worse by > 1000 in log likelihood.\nAn essential feature of the analysis is the separation of the 1430 MeV\nK\u03c0 peak between K0 (1430) and K2 (1430). This separation can be made\ncleanly only by analysing angular correlations between K \u2217 (1430) and the\naccompanying KJ (1430) ('entanglement'). The result is that the peak is\n(75 \u00b1 3)%K0 (1430) and 25%K2 (1430).\nThe \u03ba pole optimises at M = (760\u00b120(stat)\u00b140(syst))\u2212i(420\u00b145\u00b160)\n14\n\n\fMeV. The K0 (1430) is fitted with a Flatt\u00e9 formula including coupling to K\u03b7 \u2032 ;\nit requires g 2 (K\u03b7 \u2032 )/g 2(K\u03b7) = 1.0 \u00b1 0.3. A detail is that the Adler zero is\nalso included into the width of the K0 (1430) so that there is an Adler zero\nin the full K\u03c0 S-wave; this zero improves the fit noticeably.\n\n8\n\nThe \u03ba phase\n\nThe phase variation of the \u03ba with mass is well determined in two ways which\nagree. Firstly, there is a large interference between channels K \u2217 (980)\u03ba and\nKK1 (1270 + 1400). Secondly, there is a large interference between \u03ba and\nK0 (1430), which both contribute to the K\u03c0 S-wave.\nA bin-by-bin fit has been made where the \u03ba signal is fitted in magnitude\nand phase in 10 individual bins 100 MeV wide. Results are shown in Fig. 9\nand are in good agreement with the global fit (full curves). [The data points\nhave been adjusted for the phase \u03c60 of the isobar model, so that the \u03ba phase\nis zero at threshold]. The agreement between the bin-by-bin fit and the full\ncurve shows that the phase variation can be fitted by the same D(s) in both\ncases, i.e. purely by a resonance.\n\nFigure 9: Points show (a) the phase (b) the magnitude of the \u03ba amplitude,\ndetermined bin-by-bin; curves shows the global fit.\nThere is a point of general interest concerning the \u03ba phase. If there is\na pole near threshold, why does the observed phase not go through 90\u25e6 at\nlow mass? This is a subtle point. The clue is that the \u03ba pole lies in the\ncomplex s-plane almost below the KK threshold. The factor (s \u2212 sA ) in\neqn. (8) develops an imaginary part as one goes off the real s-axis. Also\nthe phase space factor \u03c1(s) becomes complex. The combined effect of these\n15\n\n\ftwo effects is to produce a phase rotation of nearly 90\u25e6 as one moves off the\nreal s-axis to the pole. At the pole, the phase does indeed go through 90\u25e6 .\nBut on the real s-axis, the constraint of unitarity holds the phase at zero\nat the K\u03c0 threshold. There is a retardation of the \u03ba phase along the real\ns- axis of roughly 90\u25e6 with respect to the pole, although there is also some\ns-dependence. This was pointed out by Oller [3]; a corresponding smaller\neffect occures likewise for the \u03c3 pole. On the real s-axis, one is really seeing\nthe upper side of the \u03ba and \u03c3 poles but with retarded phases caused by the\ncurious effects of analyticity near threshold. This is an unfamiliar situation\nand has caused widespread confusion.\nA criticism has been made that \u03ba and K0 (1430) cannot be separated in\nthe K\u03c0 S-wave. If so, phases could be adjusted freely in the bin-by-bin fit,\nbut the fit resists that. Secondly, the criticism is logically incorrect. The argument is that magnitudes and phases of both \u03ba and K0 (1430) can be fitted\nfreely as a function of s. If that were true, it would always be impossible\nto separate any two resonances with the same J P in a single channel. However, analyticity requires that real and imaginary parts of the amplitude are\nrelated and cannot be fitted independently. In the conventional approach,\neach resonance is fitted by a Breit-Wigner amplitude where magnitude and\nphase are parametrised by a single function of s. There is indeed flexibility\nin N(s) for the \u03ba, but only limited flexibility; to a first approximation, the\nreal part of the amplitude is close to the gradient of the imaginary part, as\nin the simple Breit-Wigner formula. The upshot is that the observed intensity in the K\u03c0 S-wave as a function of s is determined by the intensities of\nthe individual \u03ba and K0 (1430) and the real part of the interference between\nthem. These three terms have distinctively different s-dependence and cannot be confused, except within statistics of each component. Furthermore,\ninterferences of both \u03ba and K0 (1430) with KK1 (1270 + 1400) provide an independent determination of phases. The agreement with the phase in LASS\ndata also seems hardly fortuitous.\n\n9\n\nThe BES fit to the \u03ba\n\nAn independent analysis of exactly the same data has been reported by the\nBES group [31]. I do not have the figures, so it is necessary to refer to\nRef. [31]. This analysis parametrises the \u03ba in the same general form as\n16\n\n\fthe Ishida model [34]. The K\u03c0 S-wave amplitude is fitted as the sum of\na conventional Breit-Wigner amplitude with \u0393 \u221d \u03c1K\u03c0 plus an incoherent\nbackground which is adjusted to fit the remaining intensity as a function of\nmass. The Breit-Wigner amplitude is fitted with M = 878 \u00b1 23+64\n\u221255 MeV\n+48\nwith \u0393 at this mass of 499 \u00b1 45\u221272 MeV. The corresponding pole position is\n+48\nM = (841 \u00b1 30+81\n\u221273 ) \u2212 i(309 \u00b1 45\u221272 MeV.\nThere are some important technical differences between the two analyses.\nIn my analysis, one of the phase determinations comes from interference between \u03ba and K0 (1430). Ref. [31] states that the BES analysis omits this interference. Secondly, because of the interference between K0 (1430) and \u03ba, it is\nimportant to separate the channels K \u2217 (890)K2(1430) and K \u2217 (890)K0 (1430).\nThis separation requires analysis of the full angular correlations between decays of K \u2217 (890) and KJ (1430). The BES analysis does not consider K \u2217 (890)\ndecays [31] and therefore separates K0 (1430) and K2 (1430) only from the\nline-shape. Thirdly, the BES analysis does not include interference between\n\u03ba and K1 \u2192 \u03c1K. For these reasons, the phase of the \u03ba is not determined in\nthat analysis.\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-\n\nsB = m (K \u03c0B+ )\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nsA = m2(K-\u03c0A+ )\n\nFigure 10: The Dalitz plot for E791 data for D + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + .\n\n17\n\n\f10\n\nRe-analysis of E791 data\n\nThe Dalitz plot for E791 data on D + \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + is shown in Fig. 10.\nAlong the K \u2217 (890) bands, there is an obvious asymmetry due to interference\nwith the K\u03c0 S-wave. A new fit has been reported recently where the magnitude and phase of the K\u03c0 S-wave anplitude are fitted separately in 37 mass\nbins [35]. Results for the magnitude and phase of the K\u03c0 S-wave amplitude\nwill be shown below in Figs. 11 and 12(f).\nI have carried out a combined fit to these new E791 data, together with\nLASS data and BES, with the objective of separating \u03ba and K0 (1430) signals.\nThe BES data define well the K0 (1430) peak, which is much more conspicuous\nthere than in either LASS or E791 data. To a first approximation, the BES\ndata do not determine the \u03ba parameters strongly; they are determined mainly\nby the LASS and E791 data.\nIn the E791 fit (and also Ref. [30]), the amplitude for production includes\na form factor F = exp(\u2212\u03b1q 2 ), where q is the momentum of the \u03ba in the Ds\nrest frame and \u03b1 = 2.08 GeV\u22122 . I have varied the exponent \u03b1 and results are\nshown in Fig. 11. Panel (a) uses \u03b1 = 0 and achieves the best fit. In (b)\u2013(d)\n\u03b1 is increased in equal steps to the E791 value in (d). There is an obvious\npreference for \u03b1 close to 0. In fact \u03b1 optimises at 0 within experimental\nerror for both magnitude and phase. This corresponds to a point-like decay\nDs \u2192 \u03ba\u03c0 with an RMS radius < 0.38 fm with 95% confidence.\nFits to the BES II data and LASS data are shown in Fig. 12. In BES\ndata, the K0 (1430) is a large signal with well defined centroid and width.\nThe fit to this peak is shown in Fig. 12(e) using 25% K \u2217 (890)K2 (1430) and\n75% K \u2217 (890)K0 (1430), as determined from the fit to BES data alone. Figs.\n12(c) and (d) show that the fit to the magnitude and phase of the \u03ba in BES\ndata is acceptable. Figs. 12(a) and (b) show the fit to LASS data. There\nis a small systematic discrepancy around 1.2 GeV which resists a variety of\nparametrisations. It could be associated with the onset of KK\u03c0\u03c0 inelasticity\nwhich is presently unknown.\nFrom the combined fit, the \u03ba pole position is M = (750+30\n\u221255 ) \u2212 i(342 \u00b1 60)\nMeV. This compares with a fit to LASS data alone M = (722 \u00b1 60) \u2212 i(386 \u00b1\n50) MeV [36]. This interpretation of E791 data brings results into good\nagreement with both LASS and BES II data.\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 11: Fits to the magnitude of the \u03ba amplitude in E791 data from Ref.\n[35], for four values of \u03b1 in the form factor; \u03b1 is in units of GeV\u22122 .\n\n11\n\nf0(980)\n\nBES II data on J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c6K + K \u2212 both contain prominent f0 (980)\nsignals [37]. The data are fitted with the Flatt\u00e9 formula\nf = 1/[M 2 \u2212 s \u2212 i(g12 \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 + g22 \u03c1KK )].\n\n(9)\n\nFitted parameters are M = 965 \u00b1 8(stat) \u00b1 6(syst) MeV, g12 = 165 \u00b1 10 \u00b1 15\nMeV, g22 /g12 = 4.21 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b1 0.21. There is a second sheet pole at (998 \u00b1 4) \u2212\ni(17 \u00b1 4) MeV, very close to the KK threshold, and a distant third sheet\npole at (851 \u00b1 28) \u2212 i(418 \u00b1 72) MeV. The dominance of the narrow second\nsheet pole is used by Baru et al. [38] to argue that the f0 (980) is mostly a\nKK bound state resembling the deuteron.\nThe best current determination of the parameters of a0 (980) is from Ref.\n[39]. The second sheet pole is at M = (1032 \u00b1 5) \u2212 i(85 \u00b1 9) MeV, and the\n19\n\n\fFigure 12: Fits to (a) and (b) the phase and magnitude of LASS amplitudes\nfor elastic scatering, (c) and (d) the phase and magnitude in BES data, (e)\nthe 1430 MeV peak in the K\u03c0 mass projection of BES data, (f) the fit to\nE791 phases with \u03b1 = 0.\n\nthird sheet pole at M = (981 \u00b1 8) \u2212 i(304 \u00b1 26) MeV. This behaviour is much\nmore like a conventional resonance than f0 (980).\nIt is often argued that they are anomalously narrow states and therefore\ndecay weakly. This is quite wrong. The coupling of f0 (980) to KK corresponds to a width of 695 MeV when \u03c1KK \u2192 1. The resonance appears as a\nnarrow cusp at the KK threshold because the KK channel opens extremely\nrapidly; the increase in the total width pulls the intensity in the \u03c0\u03c0 channel\ndown sharply at threshold, making the resonance appear narrow.\nThere is another interesting way of viewing this effect. The amplitude for\n\n20\n\n\fKK \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 is given by\nf=\n\nq\n\n2g\u03c0 gK k\u03c0 kK /s\n\n1\n\u221a\n2\nkK M 2 \u2212 s \u2212 2i(g\u03c02 k\u03c0 + gK\nkK )/ s\n\n(10)\n\nwhere k\u03c0 and kK are centre of mass momenta. The cross section for this\nprocess goes as 1/kK near threshold; this is the familiar 1/v law for decay to\nopen channels near threshold. The imaginary part of the amplitude follows\nthe optical theorem\nIm f = kK \u03c3tot\n(11)\nand therefore has a step at threshold. From the dispersion relation for the\namplitude\nZ\n1 Im f (s\u2032 )ds\u2032\nRe f =\n,\n(12)\n\u03c0\ns\u2032 \u2212 s\nthe effect of the step is to generate a narrow peak in the real part at threshold.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 13 for the scattering length observed for f0 (980).\nIt is a general feature of the opening of any threshold. It provides a mechanism by which a resonance can be attracted to a threshold by the additional\nattraction of the threshold. It seems likely that this is the explanation of\nhow f0 (980) and a0 (980) are captured by the KK threshold.\n\nFigure 13: Real and imaginary part of the amplitude for KK \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0.\n\n21\n\n\f12\n12.1\n\nWhat are \u03c3, \u03ba, f0(980) and a0(980)?\n\u03c3 models and Chiral Symmetry breaking\n\nThe saga begins in the early 1960's. At this time, it was a puzzle why\nthe lightest mesons were the \u03c0 and the K, whereas ground-states of eveneven nuclei were 0+ . This led Schwinger to postulate the existence of a \u03c3\nmeson. A second puzzle was the Goldberger-Treiman relation and the fact\nthat the axial weak current is nearly conserved, like the vector current. In an\neffort to save the Goldberger-Treiman relation from renormalisation effects,\nGell-Mann and Levy invented Chiral Symmetry [40] and the linear \u03c3 model,\nplacing the pion and the \u03c3 on an equal basis. Nambu and Jona-Lasinio\ninvented the non-linear \u03c3 model [41]. Today it is still an open question\nwhether these models have any connection with the observed \u03c3 pole.\nWhen QCD emerged, it was clear that Chiral Symmetry is broken by the\nappearance of mass terms of the form mq q\u0304 in the Lagrangian. Today it is\nalmost universally accepted that Chiral Symmetry is spontaneously broken.\nSpontaneous breaking of a symmetry leads to the existence of a massless\nGoldstone boson. Many examples are known in condensed matter physics.\nA classic example is ferromagnetism where, below a critical point, spins align\nspontaneously; there is an associated massless magnon responsible for spinwaves. In a crystal, the regular spacing of atoms spontaneously creates order;\nthe phonon is the associated massless particle.\nIt is widely believed that the pion is almost massless because of Chiral\nSymmetry breaking; this leads to the Adler zero, which has played a prominent role in fitting the data on \u03c3 and \u03ba. The small mass of the pion derives\nfrom the small masses of u and d quarks. Gell-Mann, Oakes and Renner\nshowed [42] that\n*\n+\nmu + md u\u016b + dd \u0304\n2\n\u221a\nm\u03c0 =\n.\n(13)\nf\u03c02\n2\n0+\nHere, f\u03c0 is the pion decay constant. It is intriguing that the mass of the pion\nis related to the density of 0+ fluctuations. It is not presently clear whether\nthese fluctuations have any relation to \u03c3, etc.\nA confined quark will surround itself with a cloud of gluons and seaquarks. Two sets of authors [43,44] suggest that the resulting constituent\nquarks will acquire a mass of roughly one-third the mass of the nucleon. A\n\u03c3 made of two such constituent quarks would have roughly the right mass.\n22\n\n\fHowever a problem with this scheme is that one would then expect the \u03c3\nto have a brother with I = 1 at a very similar mass, whereas the a0 (980) is\n\u223c 400 MeV heavier.\n\n12.2\n\nJaffe's model\n\nThis problem led Jaffe to propose that \u03c3 and its relatives are q 2 q\u0304 2 states\n[45]. His suggestion is that there is a pairing interaction forming diquarks in\nthe flavour 3 configuration: ud, ds and us. Then 3 and 3\u0304 make a colourless\n\u221a\n \u0304 the \u03ba+ is us\u0304dd,\n \u0304 a0 is ss\u0304(u\u016b \u2212 dd)\n \u0304 2\nnonet. The \u03c3 is the I = 0 member\nu\ndd\u016b,\n0\n\u221a\n \u0304\nand f0 (980) is ss\u0304(u\u016b + dd)/\n2. This scheme neatly explains why a0 and\nf0 are degenerate in mass and heavier than the \u03c3 by twice the mass of the\ns-quark. It also neatly fits in with the intermediate mass of the \u03ba. Maiani et\nal. advocate the same scheme [46].\nAn interesting experimental question is whether there is a further ss\u0304ss\u0304\nstate. This is foreign to Jaffe's scheme. GAMS have reported tentative\nevidence for a narrow state in \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 at 1914 MeV, almost exactly the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032\nthreshold [47]. Such a state would decay easily to \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 and would be more\nprominent there than in \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 , just as f0 (980) is more prominent in J/\u03a8 \u2192\n\u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 than in J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c6K + K \u2212 : more phase space.\nThere is support for Jaffe's scheme from recent Lattice QCD calculations\nof Okiharu et al. [48]. They find configurations of Fig. 14(a) at large radii\nand those of Fig. 14(b) at small r. Lattice QCD calculations favour the\nmulti-Y-shaped flux-tube configuration for the connected 4-quark system.\nOne can rationalise this scenario with the argument that quarks at large r\nare non-perturbative and acquire mass from dressing. Another view of this\nis that it costs energy to establish a flux tube between quarks separated\nradially. The massive q 2 q\u0304 2 configuration can decay by fission to two lighter\npions at small r.\nThere is experimental support for the notion that decays to \u03c0\u03c0 are at\nshort range. The \u03c3 amplitude is known v. momentum k up to nearly 2\nGeV/c. Its Fourier transform then determines the radial dependence of the\nmatrix element; the RMS radius of the matrix element is 0.4 fm [36].\nThere is one important problem with Jaffe's scheme in its simplest version.\nThe ratio r = g 2 (f0 (980) \u2192 KK)/g 2 (a0 (980) \u2192 KK) = 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 disagrees\nwith the ratio 1 predicted from Jaffe's model. [One cannot escape from this\nproblem if f0 (980) and a0 (980) are 2-quark states. Detailed arithmetic on\n23\n\n\fFigure 14: (a) a connected tetraquark configuration, (b) a 'two-meson' configuration.\n\nbranching ratios, making use of mixing between f0 (980) and \u03c3, predicts a\nratio slightly below 1.]\nT\u00f6rnqvist [49] points out that both a0 (980) and f0 (980) must contain\na KK component in their wave functions. His eqn.

[T\u00f6rnqvist's equation is\nwritten in terms of q q\u0304, but could equally well be reformulated in terms of\n4-quark states]. His formula is easily evaluated to find the K K\u0304 components\nin a0 (980) and f0 (980) as functions of s. At the K K\u0304 threshold, the binding\nenergy \u2192 0 and the KK wave function extends to infinity, so the KK fraction\n\u2192 1. Results are shown in Fig. 15 by the dotted curves. This figure also\nshows line-shapes as the full curves. The mean KK fraction integrated over\nthe line-shape is > 60% for f0 (980) and half this for a0 (980).\nSuppose decays to \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c0\u03b7 occur at small r, following the Lattice QCD\npicture. [There will also be some 4q \u2192 KK decay at small r]. When such\ndecays occur, the passive kaonic cloud at large r is left 'in the air' (adiabatic\napproximation), and contributes to 'fall-apart' decays. The intensity of these\nfall-apart decays is proportional to the KK intensity in the wave function,\nand reduces the discrepancy with Jaffe's model by a factor 2. However, this\nargument does not account for f0 (980) lying closer to the KK threshold than\na0 (980); that must be taken from experiment.\n\n24\n\n\fFigure 15: Line shapes of f0 (980) and a0 (980), full curves; the KK fraction\nin the wave function, dotted curves; 0.1\u00d7RMS radius, dashed curves.\n\n12.3\n\nCDD poles\n\nThere is another important distinction between \u03c3 (and its family) and the\naccepted q q\u0304 states. In \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering, \u03c1 and f2 exchanges in u and\nt channels generate attraction. If one takes the K-matrix in the s-channel\nfrom these Born terms, the unitarised amplitude K/(1 \u2212 i\u03c1K) reproduces\nthe observed \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave quite well up to 1 GeV and beyond [50,51]. Similar\nexchanges are roughly sufficient to generate f0 (980) and a0 (980).\nIn this respect, \u03c3 and its relatives behave completely differently to regular\nq q\u0304 states like \u03c1, \u03c9, K \u2217 (890) and \u03c6. These cannot be derived from t and uchannel exchanges. It was this fact which led to the quark model. The\ncommonly accepted q q\u0304 resonances appear as CDD poles [52]; these are poles\nwhich identically satisfy dispersion relations with no apparent connection\nwith driving terms in N(s) on the left-hand cut.\nFor this reason, some people view \u03c3, \u03ba, f0 (980) and a0 (980) as molecular\nstates made of mesons. There is, however, an alternative view. In nucleonnucleon physics, the observed partial waves can be explained in terms of\nmeson exchanges. It is conventional to view these exchanges as generating\na potential V (r). In meson physics, it is equally possible to take the view\nthat \u03c0\u03c0 elastic scattering is telling us about the confining potential itself.\n25\n\n\fRegular q q\u0304 states are confined within this potential; their leakage out of the\npotential dictates their decay widths. These widths must come out so that\nthey satisfy analyticity over left and right-hand cuts.\nAny connection of the \u03c3, \u03ba, f0 (980) and a0 (980) poles to this potential is\npresently speculative. The formation of nuclei is clearly a phase transition.\nChiral Symmetry breaking is also clearly a phase transition; Lattice QCD\ncalculations tell us that the phase boundary is at about 160 MeV. An important question if whether Confinement is the same phase transition as Chiral\nSymmetry breaking. Present indications from Lattice QCD calculations are\nthat it has a similar transition temperature.\n\n12.4\n\nThe scheme of Van Beveren and Rupp\n\nAnother interesting, related scheme is that of Van Beveren and Rupp [53-55].\nThey set out to model the spectrum of all mesons from the lightest to charmonium and bottomonium. This is done with either a harmonic oscillator\npotential [53], which can be handled algebraically, or any kind of confinement spectrum in a more general approach [54,55]. To allow for decays, they\ncouple q q\u0304 states to outgoing mesons through a transition potential. Ideally,\nthis transition potential has a 3 P0 dependence on radius r [53], but in most\ncalculations it is approximated by a \u03b4 function at r = 0.6\u20130.7 fm or smaller\n(for heavy q-qbar systems). Their equations include a relativistic reduced\nmass for the two outgoing mesons. This reduced mass generates a zero in\nthe amplitude very similar to the Adler zero.\nIn this scheme, f0 (1370), a0 (1450), K0 (1430), etc. are regular though\nunitarised q q\u0304 states; \u03c3, \u03ba, f0 (980) and a0 (980) appear as 'extra' states created\nby coupling of q q\u0304 to mesonic decays. The \u03c3 and \u03ba were indeed predicted\nrather well in 1986 [53]. It is instructive to vary the coupling constant \u03bb\nbetween confined states and mesons. For very weak coupling, \u03c3 and \u03ba appear\n\u221a\nas continuum states with infinitely large widths, i.e. at very large \u2212Im s.\nFig. 16 shows the analogous Ds (2317) situation. As the coupling between\nconfined q q\u0304 states and outgoing mesons is increased, the continuum state\nmoves towards the real axis; simultaneously, the cs\u0304 state acquires a width\nand moves off the real s axis. In this way, they account for the Ds (2317)\nlike \u03c3 and \u03ba, i.e. as an extra, \"molecular\" state, created by coupling of the\nDK continuum to regular cs\u0304 0+ state; the latter are pushed to a higher mass\nthan that of the usual funnel potential [55].\n26\n\n\f0.75\n2.2 \u2022 \u271b 2.4\n\u2732 \u2022\n\n2.0\n\nRe(E)\n\n2.6\n\n0.5\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 0.3\n0.3 \u2022\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u2704\u2704\u2717\n\n\u2765\n\u274d\n\u03bb\u274d\n\n-0.2\n\n\u2022\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n-0.4\n\n\u2022 0.2\n-0.6\n\u2022 0.15\n-0.8\nIm(E)\n\nDK S wave\n\nFigure 16: Trajectories as a function of coupling constant \u03bb to decays.\n\n12.5\n\nExtrapolation to Nc 6= 3\n\nTheorists have tried varying the numbers of colours using Unitarised Chiral Perturbation Theory [56,57]. They find that as Nc increases, \u03c3 and \u03ba\nfade away into the continuum. [Ref. [58] agrees that they change by large\namounts, but reaches different conclusions about the precise change]. This\nis in contrast to the \u03c1 which survives largely unchanged as NC increases.\nThat is further evidence that the light scalars have a different character to\nconventional q q\u0304 states.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.E.
