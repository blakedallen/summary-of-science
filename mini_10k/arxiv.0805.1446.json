A size of these dimensions of the order of\na TeV\u22121 allows for the possibility of observing their effects on low energy processes. The\nsimplest enlargements of Minkowski space by one extra dimension, going back to Kaluza\nand to Klein [2], consists of enlarging ordinary Minkowski space, M4 , to M4 \u00d7 S1 , where\nS1 is a circle of radius R. In this work we introduce a further modification by allowing\na magnetic flux b to thread the circle S1 ; this will result in nontrivial periodicity for the\nphases of charged particle fields. In addition, such phases will make various interactions,\nspecifically electromagnetism, P and T noninvariant allowing for the presence of electric\ndipole moments.\nConstraints on the radius of the fifth dimension, R, are obtained by attributing the\ndifference between theoretical and experimental values of muon magnetic dipole moment,\n\u03b4(g\u22122)/2 , to the extra dimension. In turn, the value of the flux b will either be bounded\nby limits on the neutron electric dipole moments (edm) or place an upper bound, within\nthis model, on the muon edm. It turns out that for certain values of b/R the corrections\nto the magnetic moment are very small allowing for large values of R and in turn large\ncontributions to the edm's of some of the charged particles.\nIn restricting five dimensional QED with a compact fifth dimension one encounters the\nproblem of the fifth component of the gauge potential turning into an unwanted massless\nscalar particle. The standard method that prevents the appearance of such a state is to\ncompactify the fifth dimension on the orbifold S1 /Z2 rather than on S1 . In addition to this\norbifold compactification we shall also eliminate the unwanted massless fields by explicitly\nintroducing a large mass for the fifth component. The values of \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 and of the edm's\nare significantly different for these two approaches. Both compactification formalisms are\npresented in Sec. II Generic results for \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 and for the edm are discussed in Sec. III while\nthe numerical results and application to \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 of the muon and the edm's of the muon and\nneutron are discussed in Sec. IV.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nFIVE DIMENSIONAL QED WITH A MAGNETIC FLUX\nA.\n\nCompactification on a circle with explicit A5 mass\n\nOn the space M4 \u00d7 S1 , with M4 denoting ordinary Minkowski space-time and S1 a circle\n\nof radius R, the action for a charged four component fermion, \u03a8(xA ), and a gauge potential,\nAB (xA ), is\nS=\n\nZ\n\n1\n1\nd5 x \u03a8\u0304(i\u2202 A \u2212 e\u2032 AA )\u0393A \u03a8 \u2212 m\u03a8\u0304\u03a8 \u2212 FAB F AB + AA M AB AB .\n4\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nThe upper case super and subscripts are the five dimensional coordinates, with A =\n0, 1, 2, 3, 5, the coordinates xA = (x\u03bc , y), with 0 < y \u2264 2\u03c0R and FAB = \u2202A AB \u2212 \u2202B AA .\nThe five dimensional Clifford algebra is spanned by \u0393A = (\u03b3\u03bc , i\u03b35 ). As discussed in the\nIntroduction, we allow for the possibility of giving A5 a mass by hand. We find it convenient\nto develop the formalism using a general mass matrix M AB ; in the end four dimensional\nLorentz invariance will be reappear when only M 5,5 6= 0.

For large n the terms in the summations behave as 1/n making it\nappear divergent; however, this leading contribution cancels between n and \u2212n resulting in\na convergent series for both \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 and F3 .\nFor the F2 (n, b, R; A\u03bcn ) we have\nF2 (n, b, R; A\u03bcn )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(\n\n1\u2212z\n4z(1 + bn/R2 ) \u2212 2z(1 + z)\ndz 2\n2\n2\nz \u2212 2z(1 + nb/R ) + mn\n\nh\ni\nR2\n\u2212 2 (1 \u2212 z) z(1 + m2n ) \u2212 2m2n + (1 + bn/R2 )(1 \u2212 2z + m2n )\nn\nZ 1\n(1 \u2212 z)2 (z \u2212 1 + 2b2 /R2 )\n,\nF2 (b, R; A5 ) =\ndz\n2\n(1 \u2212 z)2 + zM55\n0\n\n)\n\n.

This results in an unwanted extra massless field. Compactifying the fifth dimension on an orbifold S1 /Z2 , which for practical purposes means that we expand all fields that\nappear at the n = 0 level, \u03a8 and A\u03bc , in even powers of n, while A5 in odd powers. Now\na periodic gauge transformation eliminates A5 completely. The expressions in (15) are as\nbefore except the summation is only over even n and terms involving A5 are absent.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\u03b4(g\u22122) limits\n\nFIG. 2: \u03b4(g\u22122) for various values of 1/mR as a function of b/mR; massive A5 (left) and orbifold\ncompactification (right); note that for b/mR = 0.9, \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 is negative. The horizontal line\nindicates the difference between Standard Model theory and experiment for the muon [5]\n\nLimitations on the compactification radius R are most readily obtained from limits of\n7\n\n\fthe contribution of propagation in the extra dimensions to the anomalous magnetic moment\n(15). To this end we will use results obtained by the E821 collaboration [5] on (g \u2212 2)/2 of\nthe muon. The correction to the anomalous magnetic moment are presented in Fig 2; for\nthe case of a massive A5 we used the value of M55 = 1/R. (In this range of parameters the\nlog-log plot is approximately linear. This is not true for lower values of 1/mR, a region of no\npresent interest.) The difference between Standard Model calculations and experiment are\n1.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 . For no magnetic flux, b = 0, this yields an upper limit on the compactification\n\nradius of 1/R \u2265 3400 m\u03bc or 1/R \u2265 360 GeV [6] for a massive A5 , and a looser bound\nof 1/R \u2265 480 m\u03bc = 50 GeV for orbifold compactification. With increasing values of the\nmagnetic flux, the limits become progressively weaker. In the interval 0.6 < b/mR < 0.9,\nand for the range of mR considered, the value of \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 changes sign; in the neighborhood\nof b/mR \u223c 0.7 (massive A5 ) or b/mR \u223c 0.71 (orbifold compactification) \u03b4(g\u22122)/2 is between\n\n10\u22122 and 10\u22124 otimes that for other values of b/mR. In this region of b/mR values of 1/R\nas low as 20 GeV for a massive A5 and 0.5 GeV for orbifold compactification are compatible\nwith the data.\n\nB.\n\nElectric dipole moment limits\n\nFIG. 3: F3 for various values of 1/mR as a function of b/mR; massive A5 (left) and orbifold\ncompactification (right)\n\n8\n\n\fWe now turn to results for electric dipole moments. These are presented in two ways:\nas a function of 1/mR for various values of b/mR, Fig. 3 and as a function of b/mR for\nfixed R, Fig. 4. The log-log plots continue to be linear to larger values of 1/mR; however\nas the difference between results for the various b/mR's is more manifest if the results are\npresented for a limited range of 1/mR.\n\nFIG. 4: F3 for orbifold compactification for various values of b/mR as a function of 1/mR; massive\nA5 (left) and orbifold compactification (right)\n\n1.\n\nMuon edm\n\nUsing the central value in Ref. [7], namely d\u03bc \u2264 3.7 \u00d7 10\u221219 e cm as an upper bound for\n\nthe edm of the muon results in F3 \u2264 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 ; for any flux this requires an unreasonably\n\nlarge compactification radius, namely 1/R < 200 m\u03bc for a massive A5 and 1/R < 20 m\u03bc for\norbifolding compactification. For 1/R = 3000, the maximum value of F3 = 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 yields\nan upper limit of d\u03bc \u2264 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221222 e cm for a muon edm.\n2.\n\nNeutron edm\n\nA similar study of the neutron edm yields the most stringent limits. In the nonrelativistic quark model the magnetic moments of the neutron and proton can be understood by\n9\n\n\fassigning to quarks a Dirac magnetic moment and a mass of roughly one third that of the\nhadron [8], implying 1/R \u2265 1000 mquark . The limit |dn | < 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221226 e cm [9] implies for\n\nFIG. 5: Combined b \u2212 R limits obtained from data on the neutron edm. The allowed region is\nbelow and to the right of the curves.\n\nthe constituent up quarks |du | \u2264 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221226 or F3,u \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 which in turn implies\n\nb/R \u2264 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 . For a massive A5 , a value of b/R \u223c 0.6 is consistent with the neutron\ndata for 1/R \u2265 60 TeV while the limit is 6 TeV for orbifold compactification. For both\ncompactification schemes the allowed regions in the b \u2212 R space are presented in Fig. 5.\n3.\n\nElectron edm\n\nFrom de \u2264 1.6 \u00d710\u221227 e-cm [10] we obtain F3,e \u2264 8 \u00d710\u221217 which implies, for b/me R = 0.3\na limit of 1/R \u2265 10 GeV. A smaller 1/R, say 1/R = 300 GeV would require b/me R = 0.03.\nOrbifold compactification and b/me R = 0.3 requires 1/R \u2265 500 GeV.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFor b = 0 the residual discrepancy between theory and experiment on (g \u2212 2)/2 of the\nmuon, Fig 2,provides the best limit on a compactification radius, namely 1/R \u2265 360 GeV\n10\n\n\ffor a massive A5 or 1/R \u2265 50 GeV for orbifold compactification. As The magnetic flux\nincreases these limits become weaker. For b/mR not taken to be very small, limits on the\nneutron edm (relying on the nonrelativistic quark model) provide the strongest constraints\non the compactification radius, reaching into the TeV region for 1/R, Fig. 5.\n\n[1] For an extensive introduction and review to both UED dimensions and ones where only gravity\npropagates into the bulk see G.
