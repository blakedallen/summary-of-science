Introduction and aim\nOn several occasions, it was suggested by different authors to model bodily tides with superposition of two symmetrical bulges. One\nbulge is always aimed at the secondary, and thus implements the instantaneous reaction of the primary's shape and potential to the\ntide-rising gravitational pull exerted by the secondary. This portion of the tide is called \"adiabatic tide\" (Zahn 1966a,b) or \"elastic\ntide\" (Ferraz Mello 2012; Krasinsky 2006). The second bulge is assumed to align orthogonally to the direction to the tide-raising\nsecondary, and thus is set to implement the entire nonelastic portion of the primary's deformation. This, second bulge is called\n\"dissipative tide\" (Zahn 1966a,b; Krasinsky 2006) or \"creep tide\" (Ferraz Mello 2012).\nIn this note, we demonstrate that the two-bulge method is not a separate approximation, but ensues directly from the Fourier\nexpansion of a linear tidal theory equipped with an arbitrary rheological model involving a departure from elasticity.\n\n2. The static linear theory of bodily tides\nLet a spherical primary of radius R be subject to the gravitational pull by a secondary of mass M sec , residing at the position\nr \u2217 = (r\u2217 , \u03c6\u2217 , \u03bb\u2217 ) , where r\u2217 \u2265 R . At a surface point R = (R, \u03c6, \u03bb) of the primary body, the tidal potential generated by the secondary\ncan be expanded over the Legendre polynomials Pl (cos \u03b3) as\n\u2217\n\nW(R , r ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=2\n\nl\n\u221e\nG M sec X \u0012 R \u0013\nWl (R , r ) = \u2212\nPl (cos \u03b3) .\nr\u2217\nr\u2217\nl=2\n\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nHere G denotes Newton's gravity constant, while \u03b3 is the angular separation between the vectors r \u2217 and R pointing from the\nprimary's centre. The longitudes \u03bb, \u03bb\u2217 are measured from a fixed meridian on the primary body, the latitudes \u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 being reckoned\nfrom the equator. The index l is conventionally named as the degree. In (1) the l = 0 term is missing, because it corresponds to the\nprincipal, Newtonian part of the secondary's potential, and is not a part of the perturbation. Omission of the l = 1 term is a more\nsubtle point related to the fact that we are describing the motion of the secondary relative to the primary body, and not relative to an\ninertial frame (see equations 8 - 11 in Efroimsky & Williams 2009).\nWithin the linear theory, the l th term Wl (R , r \u2217 ) of the secondary's potential generates a linear alteration of the primary's shape.\nThis alteration, in its turn, causes a linear amendment Ul (r) to the gravitational potential of the primary, where linear means: linear\n1\n\n\fMichael Efroimsky: Justification of the two-bulge method in the theory of bodily tides\n\nin Wl (R , r \u2217 ) . The theory of potential requires that outside the primary body Ul (r) should scale with the distance as r\u2212(l+1) . Hence\nthe said change in the primary's potential may be written down as\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\nUl (r) = kl\nWl (R , r \u2217 ) ,\n(2)\nr\nwhere R is the mean equatorial radius of the primary, R = (R , \u03c6 , \u03bb) is a point on the primary's surface, while r = (r , \u03c6 , \u03bb)\nis an exterior point right above the surface point R , at a radius r \u2265 R . The numerical factors kl are the degree-l Love numbers\ncalculated from the rheology of the primary body.\nThe overall tidally caused change of the primary's potential thus amounts to\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\nX\nX\nU(r) =\nUl (r) =\nkl\nWl (R , r \u2217 ) .\n(3)\nr\nl=2\nl=2\n\n3. Dynamical linear theories of bodily tides\nIn realistic situations, the disturbing potential is evolving, so equation (1) assumes the form of\n\u2217\n\nW(R , r (t) ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=2\n\n\u221e\nG M sec X\nWl (R , r (t) ) = \u2212\nr \u2217 (t) l=2\n\u2217\n\nR\nr \u2217 (t)\n\n!l\n\nPl (cos \u03b3(t) ) .\n\n(4)\n\nThen one should expect the distortion of the primary, as well as the corresponding amendment to its potential at an exterior point\nr , to become a function of time: U(r, t) .\n3.1. Elastic dynamical tides\n\nHad the tides contained only instantaneous, elastic components, the expressions for the tidal potential would mimic (2 - 3). At each\ninstant of time t , the degree-l term of the tide-raising potential W of the orbiting secondary would generate instantaneously an\nappropriate degree-l term of the tidal potential of the primary:\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\n(elastic)\nUl (r, t) = kl\nWl (R , r \u2217 (t) ) ,\n(5)\nr\nso the total tidal amendment to the potential of the primary would look:\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\nX\nX\n(elastic)\n(elastic)\nWl (R , r \u2217 (t) ) .\n(6)\nU(r, t) =\nUl (r, t) =\nkl\nr\nl=2\nl=2\nNeedless to say, in realistic materials the internal friction prevents the tidal deformation from being instantaneous.\n3.2. Realistic dynamical tides\n\nTo describe deviation from elasticity, we spell the two basic assumptions whereon a linear dynamical theory of bodily tides is based:\n[1] tidal deformation is linear with respect to the stress generated by the tide-raising potential;\n[2] the deformation is not fully elastic: it incorporates both an immediate and delayed portions (delayed \u2013 relative to the tide-raising\npotential).\nMathematically, assumption [1] means that an infinitesimal increment \u2206Wl (R , r \u2217 (t \u2032 ) ) , whereby the perturbing potential increased at the time t \u2032 in the past, results in a proportional present-time increment of the tidally distorted shape of the primary and,\naccordingly, in a proportional increment of the tidal amendment to its potential:\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\nkl (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) \u2206Wl (R , r \u2217 (t \u2032 ) ) ,\n(7)\n\u2206Ul (r, t) =\nr\nkl (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) being a function describing the delayed reaction of the shape. The mathematical form of this function is defined by the\nrheology of the body and by its self-gravitation.\nThus the addition Ul to the primary's potential gets expressed through the tide-raising potential Wl by a linear integral operator:\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1 Z t \u2032 =t\n\u0005\nUl (r, t) =\nkl (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) W l (R , r \u2217 (t \u2032 ) ) dt \u2032 ,\n(8)\nr\nt \u2032 =\u2212\u221e\noverdot denoting a time derivative. Integration of (8) by parts renders:\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1 Z t\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\n[kl (0)Wl (t) \u2212 kl (\u221e)Wl (\u2212\u221e)] +\nk\u0307l (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) Wl (R , r \u2217 (t \u2032 ) ) dt \u2032 ,\nUl (r, t) =\nr\nr\n\u2212\u221e\n2\n\n(9)\n\n\fMichael Efroimsky: Justification of the two-bulge method in the theory of bodily tides\n\nwhere the relaxed term \u2212 kl (\u221e)W(\u2212\u221e) should be neglected. Indeed, the current events cannot be influenced by the perturbation\nWl (\u2212\u221e) in the infinite past, wherefore kl (\u221e) = 0 . Of the remaining two terms, the unrelaxed term kl (0)Wl (t) reflects the elastic\npart of the deformation, while the integral expresses the delayed components \u2013 viscous and anelastic.\nAssumption [2] means that both the unrelaxed term kl (0)Wl (t) and the delayed term given by the integral should be kept. As\nexplained in Efroimsky (2012a,b), the relaxed term may be easily incorporated into the integral, where it should show up multiplied\nwith a Heaviside step function \u0398(t \u2212 t \u2032 ) . Then our expression for the tidal potential will acquire the simple form of\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1 Z t \u0005\nUl (r, t) =\n(10)\nkl (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) Wl (R , r \u2217 (t \u2032 ) ) dt \u2032 ,\nr\n\u2212\u221e\nkl (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) now incorporating both the delayed-reaction terms and the elastic term kl (0) \u0398(t \u2212 t \u2032 ) . The elastic part will enter the kernel\n\u0005\n\nkl (t \u2212 t \u2032 ) as kl (0) \u03b4(t \u2212 t \u2032 ) , with \u03b4(t \u2212 t \u2032 ) being the Dirac delta function. Integration of this term will furnish kl (0)Wl (t) , as in (9).\n\n4. Fourier components of tidal stresses and strains\n4.1. Tidal modes and tidal frequencies\n\u0005\n\nThe sidereal angle and the spin rate of a tidally-perturbed primary are normally denoted with \u03b8 and \u03b8 , while the node, pericentre,\nand mean anomaly of a tide-raising secondary, as seen from the primary, are denoted with \u03a9 , \u03c9 , and M.\nIn the Darwin-Kaula theory, the tide-raising potential W, the primary's deformation, and the tidal amendment U to the primary's\npotential are expanded over the modes\n\u03c9lmpq \u2261 (l \u2212 2p) \u03c9\u0307 + (l \u2212 2p + q) \u1e40 + m (\u03a9\u0307 \u2212 \u03b8\u0307) \u2248 (l \u2212 2p + q) n \u2212 m \u03b8\u0307 ,\n\n(11)\n\nl, m, p, q being integers, and n being the mean motion. Dependent upon the values of the mean motion, spin rate, and the indices,\nthe tidal modes \u03c9lmpq may be positive or negative or zero.\nThe actual forcing frequencies of the resulting stresses and strains in the primary's material are the absolute values of the tidal\nmodes:\n\u03c7lmpq \u2261 | \u03c9lmpq | ,\n\n(12)\n\nso these frequencies are always positive.\n4.2. Fourier expansions\n\nIn practical calculations, it is extremely convenient to employ complex stresses and strains, under the convention that the actual,\nphysical quantities are the real parts of their complex counterparts. This way, the Fourier series for the stress and strain look:\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03bd (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh\n\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03bd (\u03c7 s ) cos \u03c7 s t + \u03c6\u03c3 (\u03c7 s )\n\ns=0\n\nu\u03b3\u03bd (t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\ns=0\n\ni\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\ns=0\n\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011 i\nRe \u03c3\u0304\u03b3\u03bd (\u03c7 s ) exp i\u03c7 s t\n,\n\n\u221e\nX\nh\ni\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011 i\nu\u03b3\u03bd (\u03c7 s ) cos \u03c7 s t + \u03c6u (\u03c7 s ) =\nRe \u016b\u03b3\u03bd (\u03c7 s ) exp i\u03c7 s t\n,\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\ns=0\n\n\u03b3\u03bd being tensor indices, and s being a concise notation for lmpq.

However, there also is an\nimportant difference between (16) and (17). While the stresses and strains are habitually expanded in (16) over positive frequencies\n3\n\n\fMichael Efroimsky: Justification of the two-bulge method in the theory of bodily tides\n\n\u03c7 only, the potentials in (17) are expanded over the tidal modes \u03c9 , which can be positive or negative or zero, as demonstrated in\nthe Darwin-Kaula theory of tides.\nIt is of course a common fact that a real function can be decomposed into a Fourier series or integral over only positive frequencies. This way, expansions of the potentials over \u03c7 \u2261 |\u03c9| may appear to be sufficient, because a contribution from some negative\ntidal mode \u03c9 < 0 can be shown to coincide with the contribution from the appropriate positive mode |\u03c9| > 0 . Therefore, (17) may\nbe rewritten simply as\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ni\u03c7t\ni\u03c7t\nWl (t) = Re\nW\u0304l (\u03c7) e d\u03c7\nand\nUl (t) = Re\n\u016al (\u03c7) e d\u03c7 ,\n(19)\n0\n\n0\n\nwhere W\u0304l (\u03c7) = 2 W\u0304l (\u03c9) and \u016al (\u03c7) = 2 \u016al (\u03c9) .\nSurprisingly, the theory of tides is a rare exception from the rule, in that this theory does distinguish between the contribution\nfrom a negative tidal mode and that from a positive mode of the same absolute value. Fortunately, the difference shows up only at\nthe stage when one calculates tidal forces or torques (Efroimsky 2012a,b). As in the current paper we discuss potentials only, we\nshall ignore this subtlety and shall employ (19) instead of (17).\n4.3.

The kernels k\u0307l (t \u2212 t ) are named Love functions, a\nterm suggested by Churkin (1998). The functions k\u0304l (\u03c7) are called complex Love numbers, in understanding however that these\n\"numbers\" change with frequency. An approach similar to (22) was taken by Mathis and Le Poncin Lafitte (2009). These authors\nintroduced a complex impedance as the ratio between the complex Love number and the static Love number. Their equation (107)\nis equivalent to our (22), up to a convention on the sign of the argument.\nWe see from (21) that at each frequency \u03c7 , the negative argument \u01ebl (\u03c7) is a measure of lagging of the spectral component\nUl (\u03c7) , relative to appropriate spectral component Wl (\u03c7) :\n\u03c6Ul (\u03c7) = \u03c6Wl (\u03c7) \u2212 \u01ebl (\u03c7) .\n\n(23)\n\n5. Decomposition of a tidal mode into an in-phase part and an in-quadrature (lagging by 90o ) part\nIn the expression (21), we may set the initial phase of W\u0304l (\u03c7) to be zero, and reckon the phase of \u016al (\u03c7) from W\u0304l (\u03c7) . This will enable\nus to single out, in \u016al (\u03c7) , a part which is in phase with W\u0304l (\u03c7) , and also to see what part of \u016al (\u03c7) is out of phase with W\u0304l (\u03c7) .\nAccording to (23), nullification of the phase of W\u0304l (\u03c7) makes the phase of \u016al (\u03c7) equal to the negative argument of k\u0304l (\u03c7) . So\n(21) will assume the form of\n\u0012 R \u0013l+1\ni\u03c7t\n\u2212 i \u01ebl (\u03c7)\ni \u03c7 t \u2212 i \u01ebl (\u03c7)\n,\n(24)\nWl 0 (\u03c7) e\nkl 0 (\u03c7) e\n=\nUl 0 (\u03c7) e\nr\nwhere we introduced simplified notations Ul 0 (\u03c7) , Wl 0 (\u03c7) and kl 0 for real amplitudes:\nUl 0 (\u03c7) \u2261 | \u016al (\u03c7) |\n\n,\n\nWl 0 (\u03c7) \u2261 | W\u0304l (\u03c7) |\n\n,\n\nkl 0 (\u03c7) \u2261 | k\u0304l (\u03c7) | .\n\n(25)\n\nBy means of the Euler formula, (24) can be trivially expanded as\n\u0003\n\u0002\nUl 0 (\u03c7) cos (\u03c7t \u2212 \u01ebl (\u03c7) ) + i sin (\u03c7t \u2212 \u01ebl (\u03c7) )\n\u0012 R \u00132l+1\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(26)\nkl 0 (\u03c7) cos \u01ebl (\u03c7) \u2212 i sin \u01ebl (\u03c7) Wl 0 (\u03c7) cos(\u03c7t) + i sin(\u03c7t) .\nr\nThe actual, physical tide-raising potential Wl (\u03c7) is the real part of the complex W\u0304l (\u03c7). So it is rendered by Wl0 (\u03c7) cos(\u03c7t) , where\nwe set the initial phase nil, as agreed above. Similarly, the actual, physical tidal potential Ul (\u03c7) is the real part of the complex Ul (\u03c7),\nand it reads as:\n=\n\nUl0 (\u03c7) cos \u01ebl (\u03c7) cos(\u03c7t) \u2212 Ul0 (\u03c7) sin \u01ebl (\u03c7) sin(\u03c7t)\n=\n4\n\n\u0012 R \u00132l+1\nr\n\nkl0 (\u03c7) cos \u01ebl (\u03c7) Wl0 (\u03c7) cos(\u03c7t) +\n\n\u0012 R \u00132l+1\nr\n\nkl0 (\u03c7) sin \u01ebl (\u03c7) Wl0 (\u03c7) sin(\u03c7t) .\n\n(27)\n\n\fMichael Efroimsky: Justification of the two-bulge method in the theory of bodily tides\n\nIn this expression for the actual real Ul , we see not one but two terms. One is the elastic part of the tide, a part that is in phase with\nthe real Wl . This is the term proportional to cos(\u03c7t) :\n(in phase)\n\nUl = Ul0 (\u03c7) cos \u01ebl (\u03c7) cos(\u03c7t) =\n\n\u0012 R \u00132l+1\nr\n\nkl0 (\u03c7) cos \u01ebl (\u03c7) Wl0 (\u03c7) cos(\u03c7t) ,\n\n(28)\n\nWe see that the \"response factor\" is equal to kl0 (\u03c7) cos \u01ebl (\u03c7) , where kl0 (\u03c7) is the real amplitude of the complex Love number (call\nthis amplitude dynamical Love number).\nThe second component is the in-quadrature term, which is proportional to sin(\u03c7t) :\n(in quadrature)\n\nUl = \u2212 Ul0 (\u03c7) sin \u01ebl (\u03c7) sin(\u03c7t) =\n\n\u0012 R \u00132l+1\nr\n\nkl0 (\u03c7) sin \u01ebl (\u03c7) Wl0 (\u03c7) sin(\u03c7t) .\n\n(29)\n\nNaturally, the expression of this term via Wl contains kl0 (\u03c7) sin \u01ebl (\u03c7) .\nTherefore, as soon as we express Ul via Wl by an integral operator permitting delayed action (Eqn. 9), we automatically arrive\nat the two components of the tidal Ul , at each frequency involved, \u2013 the adiabatic component and the dissipative component (using\nthe terms of Zahn 1966) or the elastic one and the creep one (as Ferraz-Mello 2012 named them).1\nSimilar decomposition will take place for the harmonic modes of the primary's surface elevation, except that the Love number\nhl will be involved instead of kl . For the principal, {lmpq} = {2200} , tidal mode, this situation is illustrated, in a very exaggerated\nmanner, by Figure 1.\n\nFig. 1. Decomposition of the semidiurnal tide into the elastic and dissipative components.\nThe primary is spinning at the rate \u03b8\u0307 , with \u03b8 being its sidereal angle. The secondary is orbiting the primary with the mean motion n .\nThe ellipse shaded green depicts the principal, semidiurnal mode of the tides exerted on the primary by the secondary. This is the mode\nnumbered with {lmpq} = {2200} . The semimajor axis of the green ellipse deviates from the direction towards the perturber by a geometric lag angle. For the semidiurnal tide, this angle is equal to 12 \u01eb2 (\u03c92200 ) , where \u01eb2 is the phase lag as a function of the principal tidal mode \u03c92200 .\nIt is shown here, in an exaggerated manner, how the principal tidal mode gets decomposed into two components. One is the elastic bulge depicted by the ellipse aligned with the perturber. Another is the dissipative bulge depicted with the ellipse aligned orthogonally.\n\nIt should finally be mentioned that in the case of stars and giant planets it is, technically, difficult to solve the emerging hydrodynamical problem analytically. Therefore, in practical calculations of fluid equilibrium tides in such bodies, the two-bulge method\nis the only known elegant option of getting an acceptable analytical solution. One first solves the hydrodynamical equations governing the adiabatic component (26). The adiabatic adjustment of the structure is deduced from the hydrostatic balance. Then, since\nthe velocity field is preserved along isobars, one obtains the radial component of the adiabatic velocity field induced by the tide.\nThe subsequent calculation of the horizontal component is based on the velocity field being divergence-free. The knowledge of the\nadiabatic velocity field makes it possible to determine the viscous force. This force drives the dissipative component of the velocity\nfield. The process leads to mass redistribution inside the body, and thus to perturbation of the density and gravitational potential\n(27). The described, two-bulge approach is available because in the fluid equilibrium tide the dissipative component is much weaker\nthan the adiabatic component. The method is implemented, e.g., in the work by Remus et al. (2012a), which furthers the original\ntwo-bulge approach offered by Zahn (1966).\n1\n\nAlso see the work by Krasinsky (2006), who employed the terms elastic and dissipative.\n5\n\n\fMichael Efroimsky: Justification of the two-bulge method in the theory of bodily tides\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn this short note, we pointed out a simple rule linking the two methods (or, possibly better to say, two languages), in which bodily\ntides have been described by different authors. The language of complex amplitudes is more economical and is conventional to\nthose who studied the theory of vibrations, in physics or engineering. The language of two bulges turns out to be equivalent to that\nof complex amplitudes. Although less economical mathematically, the two-bulges language has some illustrative power, and may\nbe employed (like, e.g., in Remus et al. 2012a,b) on a par with the more concise method of complex amplitudes.\nImportantly, the existence of two mutually orthogonal bulges at each tidal frequency is not a separate approximation (as was\npresumed by some of the devotees of the two-bulge method), but is a consequence of the linearity assumption implemented by\nthe integral operator (10). As soon as we say that the tidal deformation is linear but not fully elastic \u2013 this deformation can be\ndecomposed, at each tidal frequency, into an in-phase and an in-quadrature part.\n\n7.
