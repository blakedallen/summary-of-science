I NTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, the study of cognitive radios from an\ninformation theoretic perspective has gained prominence\n[1]. As the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\ndetermines the ways and bands in which cognitive radios can\nbe used, it is imperative that we understand the fundamental\nlimits of these radios to benchmark gains from their design\nand deployment. Cognitive radio channels refer to those\nmedia of communication in which cognitive radios operate,\nthereby efficiently utilizing available resources. Moreover,\nsince most wireless systems these days use multiple antennas\nat the transmitter and receiver, it is important that we study\nthe limits in a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)\nsetting. The situation considered in this paper is different\nfrom the traditional class of MIMO problems on account of\nthe intelligent and adaptive capabilities of the cognitive radios.\nBased on the model proposed in [2], the cognitive\nradio channel is an interference channel [3][4][5][6] with\ndegraded message sets in which the transmitter with a\nsingle message is called the \"primary\" or \"licensed\" user\nwhile the transmitter with both message sets is called the\n\"secondary\" or \"cognitive\" user. In this paper, we study the\nsum capacity of cognitive radios in a MIMO setting where\nboth the primary and secondary transmitter and receivers\nhave multiple antennas and the noise is Gaussian. The sum\ncapacity enables the design of a MIMO cognitive radio\nsystem by specifying the sum rate required for the primary\nand the secondary users. Recently, an achievable region was\nfound and shown to be optimal for the sum rate of the primary\nand secondary users [7] under certain conditions on channel\nparameters. Though an achievable coding strategy based on\nCosta's dirty paper coding [8] was shown to be optimal,\n\nan optimization over transmit covariances is required. The\noptimization to determine the sum capacity is in general a\nnonconvex problem and is hence computationally difficult\n[9].\nIn this paper, we find that the nonconvex problem\nformulation is similar to a MIMO Broadcast Channel\n(BC) sum capacity problem formulation [10]. We therefore\ntransform the nonconvex problem into a convex problem by\nusing \"duality\"' techniques as detailed in [10]. As a result\nwe obtain a convex-concave game which can be solved in\npolynomial time. We propose efficient algorithms to find the\nsaddle point of the problem and hence compute the sum\ncapacity and optimal transmit policies.\nThe convex-concave game formulation of the sum capacity\nof the MIMO Cognitive Channel (MCC) is a minimax\nproblem in which the inner maximization corresponds to\ncomputing the sum capacity of a MIMO Multiple Access\nChannel (MAC) subject to a sum power constraint. There are\nmany efficient algorithms in literature that solve saddle point\nproblems and they are analogous to convex optimization\ntechniques like interior point and bundle methods [11].\nHowever these algorithms are both much more involved than\nour algorithm and offer limited intuition about the structure of\nthe optimal value. Our algorithm is based on the sum power\niterative waterfilling algorithm for BC channels [12], but is\nsignificantly different as the waterlevel is no longer given,\nbut has to be discovered through adaptation. We thus call\nthis strategy, the adaptive sum power waterfilling algorithm,\nto achieve our objective of solving the minimax problem.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\nthe system model is described and in Section III, we state the\nsum capacity problem for MCC. In Section IV, the convex\nproblem formulation is described. In Section V, we propose\nthe algorithm and numerical results are given in Section VI.\nWe conclude the paper in Section VII.\nII.

F ORMULATION AS A C ONVEX P ROBLEM\nThe inner maximization in the sum capacity of the MCC,\nstated above, corresponds to computing the sum capacity\nof a degraded broadcast channel in which the transmitters\ncooperate with a sum power constraint. This is illustrated in\nFig. 2. We observe from the expression for the sum capacity\nin (1) that the inner maximization problem is not a concave\nfunction of the covariance matrices Qp and \u03a3c,c . Thus\nit is difficult to solve the entire problem using numerical\ntechniques. However, as in [12], we can use \"duality\" to\ntransform the inner maximization problem into a sum capacity\nproblem for the MAC with the same sum power constraint.\nThis can be done because it is shown in [10] that sum\ncapacity of the BC is exactly equal to the sum capacity of\nthe dual MAC. These results enable us to convert the original\nproblem to a convex-concave game.\nZpn\n\nPrimary Receiver\n\nK\u03b1\n\nCognitive Receiver\n\nJoint Source\n\nX n(mp, mc)\nPower Constraint\n\nPp + \u03b1Pc\n\nWe propose a class of algorithms to compute the sum\ncapacity of the MCC. These algorithms are motivated by the\nsum power water-filling algorithms developed for computing\nthe sum capacity and obtaining the optimal transmit policies\nfor the MIMO BC. As in [12], we obtain a dual convex\nproblem corresponding to a MAC. This dual MAC problem is\na convex problem and thus can be solved using the multitude\nof convex solvers in polynomial time. Our intention, as that\nin [9][13] is to exploit the problem's structure to yield a more\nintuitive and easy-to-implement algorithm for this problem.\nSpecifically, it is to derive an algorithm that reflects and\nconverges to the KKT conditions corresponding to cognitive\nradio sum capacity.\n\nBefore proceeding further, we review the waterfilling algorithm for the single user point to point MIMO case. Consider\nthe problem,\n\nYcn\nZcn\nFig. 2.\n\nV.

This was then extended to\nBCs by the sum power iterative waterfilling algorithm in\n[13], which is based on the dual MAC's KKT conditions.\nWhile neither of these two algorithms works directly\nfor the MIMO cognitive radio channel, we use analogous\nprinciples to derive an adaptive sum power iterative algorithm.\n\nYpn\nG\u03b1\n\noutputs a set of BC covariance matrices which achieve the\nsame sum rate as the MAC covariance matrices.\n\nmax\n\nMIMO Broadcast Channel\n\nTr(S)\u2264P, S\u00170\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n0\n0\n, where the zero matrices have ap0 \u03a3c,c\npropriate dimensions such that \u03a3c,c has dimension nc,t \u00d7 nc,t\nand Qc has dimension (np,t + nc,t ) \u00d7 (np,t + nc,t ). The sum\ncapacity of the MCC can therefore be expressed as\nLet Qc =\n\nCMCC = inf max log|I + G\u2020\u03b1 S1 G\u03b1 + K\u2020\u03b1 S2 K\u03b1 |\n\n(3)\n\nLet the eigen values of the covariance matrix S of size n\u00d7n be\n\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn and the singular values of the channel matrix\nH be \u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3n . Then the waterfilling solution is given\nby\n\u03bbi + 1/\u03c3i2 = K, if\n\n1/\u03c3i2 < K\n\n(4)\n\n1/\u03c3i2\n\n\u03b1>0 S1 ,S2\n\nsubject to S1 , S2 \u0017 0, Tr(S1 ) + Tr(S2 ) \u2264 Pp + \u03b1Pc\n\n1\nlog|I + H\u2020 SH|.\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the maximization is performed over covariance matrices\nS1 and S2 , which are obtained using BC-to-MAC transformations of Qp and Qc such that the sum of the traces of S1\nand S2 satisfies the sum power constraint Pp + \u03b1Pc . This\nnew problem is concave in the covariance matrices S1 and\nS2 and convex in the scalar \u03b1 with linear power constraints\nand is thus a convex-concave game. The proof of the fact\nthat the problem is convex in \u03b1 is given in the appendix.\nThis min-max problem can be solved by using interior point\nmethods or other equivalent convex optimization methods for\nsaddle point problems which have polynomial time complexity\n[11]. Once the optimal S1 and S2 are obtained, we can apply\nthe MAC-to-BC transformation [10] to obtain the optimal\ntransmit policies of our original problem. The MAC-to-BC\ntransformation, takes a set of MAC covariance matrices and\n\n\u03bbi = 0, if\n\u2265 K,\n(5)\nP\nwhere K is a constant such that i \u03bbi = P . KKT conditions,\nalong with complementary slackness yield conditions (4) and\n(5) [14][15]. We now recall the sum power iterative waterfilling solution for the MIMO MAC as studied in [13]. The\nproblem is stated below:\nX \u2020\n1\nH i Si H i |\n(6)\nlog|I +\nP max\nTr(\nSi )\u2264P, Si \u00170 2\ni\n\nThe KKT conditions for this problem are similar to the\npoint to point case except that in the MAC case, the\nchannel H in (3) for User i is replaced\nby the effective\nP\nchannel matrix Hi,ef f = Hi (I + j6=i H\u2020j Sj Hj ). In the\nsum power waterfilling algorithm, we waterfill for all the\nusers simultaneously, while in individual power iterative\nwaterfilling, user waterfilling is sequenced [12].\n\n\fThe problem considered in this paper has a min-max formulation as given in (2) unlike the pure max formulations\nfor the MAC and BC capacity problems [12][13]. The idea\nbehind our algorithm is to start with a feasible choice for\n\u03b1. For a given \u03b1, the joint water-filling on the two users is\nthe optimal strategy for the inner maximization problem. In\n(2), we perform a joint water-fill exactly once for the inner\nmaximization, use this solution to solve the outer minimization\nwith respect to \u03b1 and iterate between the two. Thus, we end\nup with one maximization problem (for a choice of \u03b1) given\nby\n\na joint waterfill with power Pp + \u03b1(n\u22121) Pc .\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n{S1 , S2 } = argmax log|I + G\u2020\u03b1(n\u22121) T1 G\u03b1(n\u22121)\nT1 ,T2\n\n+ K\u2020\u03b1(n\u22121) T2 K\u03b1(n\u22121) |\nsubject to T1 , T2 \u0017 0 and\nTr(T1 ) + Tr(T1 ) \u2264 Pp + \u03b1(n\u22121) Pc .\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n4) Use S1 and S2 from Step 3 to obtain \u03b1(n) by solving\nthe following univariate optimization problem.\n(n)\n\nS1 , S2 = argmax log|I +\nT1 ,T2\n\nG\u2020\u03b1 T1 G\u03b1\n\n+\n\n\u03b2>0\n\nwhere \u03b3 =\n\nsubject to T1 , T2 \u0017 0, Tr(T1 ) + Tr(T1 ) \u2264 Pp + \u03b1Pc\nand a minimization problem (for a given choice of covariances) as:\n\u03b1 = argmin log|I + G\u2020\u03b2 \u03b3S1 G\u03b2 + K\u2020\u03b2 \u03b3S2 K\u03b2 |\n\u03b2>0\n\nwhere \u03b3 =\n\nPp + \u03b2Pc\nis a scalar\nPp + \u03b1(n\u22121) Pc\n\nand \u03b1(n\u22121) is the previous iterate of \u03b1.\nThe solution of one is fed to the other, and the process\nis repeated until convergence. This forms the core of the\nadaptive sum power iterative waterfilling algorithm.\nWe refer to the procedure detailed above as Algorithm\n1. As the minimization with respect to \u03b1 can be somewhat\ninvolved (even though \u03b1 is a scalar), we construct another\nalgorithm we call Algorithm 2. In Algorithm 2, we only\nobtain a descent at each iteration by a simple line search\nlike Newton search. We do not solve the outer minimization\nproblem completely at every iteration as in Algorithm 1,\nwhich further simplifies the overall algorithm. In Section VI,\nwe illustrate through examples that this highly simplified\nalgorithm, with one waterfill and one descent in each iteration\nhas nearly as good a convergence rate as exact solutions\nat each step. In the following, n refers to the iteration number.\nMain Algorithm (Algorithm 1):\n1) Initialize \u03b1(0) to any number greater than 0.\n2) Generate the effective channels as\n(n)\n\nG\u03b1,ef f =\n(n)\n\nK\u03b1,ef f =\n\n(n\u22121)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\nK\u03b1(n\u22121) I + G\u2020\u03b1(n\u22121) S1\n(n)\n\nPp + \u03b2Pc\nis a scalar.\nPp + \u03b1(n\u22121) Pc\n\n5) Return to Step 2 until parameters converge.\nAs mentioned before, the above algorithm is a very intuitive\nextension to the sum power waterfilling algorithm for the\nMIMO BC channel. The intuition arises from the fact that\nat the saddle point, the KKT conditions must be satisfied for\nboth the max and the min problems. Although we may not be\nable to always guarantee convergence of the algorithm to the\noptimal solution, when it does converge, the algorithm takes\nvery few iterations to do so.\nVI. N UMERICAL R ESULTS\nIn this section we present numerical results to compare\nthe behavior of Algorithms 1 and 2. In Fig. 3, we plot the\nsum rate versus the number of iterations for a MCC with two\nantennas at both the primary and cognitive receiver and one\nantenna each at the primary and cognitive transmitter with\npower constraints Pp = Pc = 5. The channel matrices are\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22120.4326 \u22121.6656\nG\u03b1 =\n0.1253\n0.2877\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 \u22121.1465\nand K\u03b1 =\n0 1.1909\nwhen \u03b1 = 1. We find that both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2\nconverge to the same sum rate. However this may not always\nhappen depending on the initial conditions chosen for the\nNewton search. We also observe that in some cases Algorithm\n1 converges in fewer iterations when compared to Algorithm\n2.\nVII.
