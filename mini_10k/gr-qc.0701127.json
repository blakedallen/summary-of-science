Different spacetimes could exist and our universe would be just one more among that\nensemble of completely causally disconnected spacetimes.\nActually, it was Giordano Bruno who first realized that\nthere could exist many other worlds other than ours [1].\nThis idea has triggered several centuries later the development of different theories of the multiverse, this time\nwith quite less risks. Quite possibly, the best known is the\nmany-universes theory derived from the relative-stateformulation due to Everett when applied to cosmology\n[2, 3], which states that all branches of a wave function\nfor the universe correspond to equally real different universes existing in parallel within an overall multiverse.\nBut there are multiverse models, too that appear outside the quantum realm, in the framework of general relativity. One example of a multiverse that does not make\nexplicit recourse to a quantum formalism could be the\nchaotic inflationary multiverse [4]. In every flat space\nwhich has an event horizon, such as it happens in the\ninflationary universe, a closed causal region of spacetime\nis settled which can be influenced by observers. Since\nthe universe is flat, it is infinite so for observers who are\nspace-like separated by distances greater than the sum of\ntheir respective distances to the event horizons, their respective causal domains are disjoint and therefore every\ninflationary domain can be interpreted as a single universe in the framework of this classical multiverse. Another possible multiverse may appear when we consider\nthe current accelerated expansion of the Universe. If we\nchoose as dark energy phantom energy [5], then a singularity is predicted to occur in the finite future [6]. This\nsingularity divides the universe into two classically non-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nsalvarp@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\npra@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\na.rozas@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\np.gonzalezdiaz@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\n\nconnected regions, before and after the singularity [7].\nHere an idea of the multiverse would also appear because\nthat model necessarily requires a precise discretization of\nthe parameter in the equation of state, if one wants to\nconsider the region after the big rip as a part of the whole\nspacetime. Each value of the discretized parameter of the\nequation of state would then describe a single universe in\nthe context of an in infinite multiverse.\nRecently, string theory has also resorted to the multiverse idea to interpret the multiplicity of positive- energy\nvacua which rises up to order 10100 to 10500 [8]. The different subuniverses described by this string landscape [9]\ncould be different regions of space, different eras of time\nin a single big bang, different regions of spacetime or different parts of quantum mechanical Hilbert space ( being\nthese alternatives not mutually exclusive) [10].\nFurthermore, another multiverse model has been discussed by Smolin [11], who conjectured that new universes are spawned within black holes, and that this kind\nof baby universes will inherit the physics of the parent\nuniverse but with small random variations. The process could continue ad infinitum. Universes that produce\nmany black holes would induce more progeny too, representing the largest volume of space.\nOn the other hand, in the ekpyrotic model of Steinhard and Turok [12], a brane collides with a confining\nthree-dimensional boundary to a four-dimensional space\nto create the big bang. The four-dimensional space can\nbe foliated with any number of branes each of which, in\nthe absence of collisions, constitutes a universe.\nWithin the framework of the current accelerated expansion of the universe mentioned above, we have considered in this paper a new model in which we have taken\ninto account the existence of a negative cosmological constant. A spacetime with a negative cosmological constant\nis worth investigating, since it allows a consistent physical\ninterpretation and naturally appears in elementary particle theories. Indeed, in string theory, as in supergravity\ntheories, the vacuum has a negative energy density, which\nmeans that it is described by anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In an important advance to understand quantum\nissues in strong gravitational fields it was conjectured in\n1997 that string theory in an AdS background is equiv-\n\n\f2\nalent to a conformal field theory (CFT) [13]. This is a\nbeautiful and concrete example of the holographic principle in quantum gravity [14]. It is with this motivation\nthat we in this paper consider a cosmic model of dark\nenergy with a negative constant vacuum energy.\nIf we consider a quintessence field to describe dark energy, one can describe it as a perfect fluid with an equation of state p = w\u03c1 = w\u03c10 (a(t)/a0 )\u22123(1+w) , where p and\n\u03c1 are the pressure and energy density of the fluid, respectively, and w a constant parameter. The Friedmann\nequation for this flat model, which contains a negative\ncosmological constant \u039b, can be written as\nH 2 = \u2212\u03bb + Ca\u22123\u03b2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03bb = |\u039b|/3, where \u03bb < 8\u03c0\u03c10 /3 in order for H0 to be\nreal; C = 8\u03c0\u03c10 /(3a\u22123\u03b2\n) and \u03b2 = 1 + w. By integrating\n0\nEq. (1), we can obtain the cosmic scale factor, yielding\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u03b2 1/2\na(t) = a0 cos\n\u03bb (t \u2212 t0 )\n2\n2\n\u00131/2\n\u0013# 3\u03b2\n\u0012\n\u0012\n3\u03b2 1/2\nC \u22123\u03b2\na\n\u22121\n\u03bb (t \u2212 t0 )\nsin\n(2)\n.\n+\n\u03bb 0\n2\nFor the case in which the dark energy is phantom energy, that is, when \u03b2 < 0, this factor is converted into\n2\n\u2212 3|\u03b2|\n\n, (3)\na(t) = a0 [cos (\u03b1(t \u2212 t0 )) \u2212 b sin (\u03b1(t \u2212 t0 ))]\n\u0001\n1/2\n1/2\nand b = 8\u03c0\n. It is easy to\nwhere \u03b1 = 3|\u03b2|\n2 \u03bb\n3\u03bb \u03c10 \u2212 1\nsee that the scale factor diverges an infinite number of\ntimes along the full time interval. Each of such divergences actually describes a big rip singularity that takes\nplace at\n\"\u0012\n\u0013\u22121/2 #\n2\n2n\u03c0\n8\u03c0\u03c10\ntbrn = t0 +\n\u22121\n+\narctg\n,\n3\u03bb\n3|\u03b2|\u03bb1/2\n3|\u03b2|\u03bb1/2\n(4)\nwith n any natural number. We recover the expression\nfor the big rip time obtained in a quintessence model of\nphantom energy without cosmological constant [6], when\nwe set n = 0 in expression (4) and expand it for \u03bb << 1,\ntbr = t0 +\n\n1\n1/2\n\n|\u03b2| (6\u03c0\u03c10 )\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nIn the light of Eq. (4) we can in fact see that this\nmodel will have infinite big rip singularities. This can\nbe interpreted as follows: classically, a singularity cuts\noff the space time, so the different regions between big\nrips would be isolated. Thus, each of them would correspond to a different universe, independent of the rest,\ni.e., another spacetime. But, as Eq.(3) tell us, these independent universes are identical among them and have\nthe same physical characteristics. All of them begin at a\nbig rip singularity, and then progressively contract until\na given, constant, minimum value of the scale factor,\n\u00131/3\u03b2\n\u0012\n8\u03c0\u03c10\n> 0,\n(6)\namin = a0\n3\u03bb\n\nafter which the given universe starts expanding, all the\nway in an accelerated fashion, to again reach the next\nbig rip singularity, (see Fig. 1). The minimum value in\nEq. (6) has been obtained from the extremum value that\ncorresponds to equating to zero Eq. (1). The lifetime of\nevery of these universes is given by\ntu =\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n3|\u03b2|\u03bb1/2\n\n(7)\n\nIt follows from Eq. (7) that the smaller \u03bb the longer the\nuniverse life tu . It can be seen that if \u03bb = 0, where we\nrecover the quintessence model of phantom energy, these\ntime differences are infinite, as in this model of usual\nphantom there is a unique big rip.\nGiven that, as we have said before, the infinite singularities have cut off the spacetime generating infinite\ncausally disconnected spacetimes, we can re-scale and redefine the time in each of these spacetimes in some appropriate form, independently in each of them. This way,\nthe scale factor reaches its minimum value in the zero of\nthe so obtained new symmetrical time of symmetry. The\naforementioned scale factor can be written in a more compact form as\na(\u03c4 ) = amin (cos\u03c4 )\n\n2\n\u2212 3|\u03b2|\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwith the new time \u03c4 covering the interval (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) in\nevery universe, reaching the initial and final big rips at\nthe extrema. Each of the universes in the multiverse is\nsomething as though it were a faster-expanding de Sitter\nspace defined along a finite time interval.\nIf we assumed that all these universes are classically\nidentical and that our universe is in fact described by\nthis model, we could dare to claim that such universes\nare governed by the same physical laws as ours, given\nthat all of them would then be exactly physically equivalent. Classically, the existence of life in our universe\nmight be justified as a byproduct of the anthropic principle in its various formulations. If we think that life exists\nbecause the initial conditions of our universe allow it to\noccur, the physical equivalence of the various universes\nwould imply that, classical life existed such as we know\nit in all of them. But if we considered the emergence of\nlife as a process somehow dependent on quantum effects,\nas it seems to be the case, it would no longer be consistent to extrapolate ideas about such existence based on\na classical extension of the physical laws.\nWe could envisage a model where the expansion is not\ncaused by a phantom fluid, but by dark energy itself, i. e.,\n\u03b2 > 0 in the equation of state. In this case, we would also\nobtain a multiverse scenario with the same characteristics among the universes, but these would now be closed\nuniverses that would decelerate from a big bang until\nits scale factor reached a finite maximum value (given by\nEq.(6) with \u03b2 > 0), from that value onwards the universe\nwould contract in size until finally it died in a big crunch\nsingularity (see Fig. 1); being therefore unable to explain\nthe current accelerated expansion of our universe.\n\n\f3\n\nScale factor\n\n(a )\n\n(b )\nTime\nFigure 1: Time evolution corresponding to a universe\nequipped with a negative cosmological constant and: (a)\nquintessential dark energy with \u03b2 > 0 and (b) phantom energy\nwith \u03b2 < 0.\n\ncaused by this fluid, in such a way that it would cause not\njust one but infinite big crunches. Hence in both cases\nwe obtain a classical multiverse scenario, in which the\nuniverses are identical among them. This scenario could\nbe altered if we included the evolution of astronomical\nobjects in this model [15].\nAs we said before, the models suggested in the present\npaper are purely classical, therefore considering quantum\neffects would probably smooth out the singularities [16],\nin such a way that we would no longer have an infinite\nset of isolated spacetimes, so implying the loss of the\nmultiverse scenario.\nThe appeal of the multiverse models lies on that it\npoints toward a less predominant position of what we call\nour universe in nature. It could well be that, once again,\nwe would have missed the denomination of a physical\nsystem and, in a similar way to terms such as atom or\nelementary particles were once wrongly used to denote\nwhat it turned out to be essentially divisible systems, we\ncould well be now applying the term \"universe\" to what\nis nothing but just a single part or product of it [17].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIn view of the results obtained in this work, it is worth\nmentioning that whereas the insertion of a negative cosmological constant in a phantom energy model has the effect of repeating the big rip singularity an infinite number\nof times, the analogous consideration of this in a model\nwith dark energy slows down the accelerated expansion\n\n[1] D.
