INTRODUCTION\n\nSingle donor systems in silicon have been the subject\nof much research in recent years from both theorists and\nexperimentalists alike. While a number of experiments\nhave probed into the physics of single donors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\nmany others have concentrated on precision control and\nfabrication of qubits based on individual donors [6, 7].\nApart from the initially predominant effective mass based\napproaches for donor modeling [8, 9], a number of other\ntechniques have been successfully applied to study realistic devices and interpret experimental results in detail\n[10, 11, 12].\nAlthough the initial qubit proposals utilized the spin\nof the donor electron or nucleus to encode qubits [13, 14,\n15], one can also envisage fabricating and controlling the\ncharge degrees of freedom of a simple donor molecule: a\nsingly ionized double donor system [16]. Steps along this\ndirection have been achieved with charge state transfer\nbetween two P donors in silicon reported [17], and a single electron in a donor-interface double well forming a\nnew hybrid molecular system [3]. Despite possessing the\ndisadvantages of shorter decoherence times, such a charge\nqubit system is easier to probe experimentally and may\nhelp to demonstrate the feasibility of theoretical quantum\ncomputation concepts. The donor based charge qubit is\nalso more amenable to measurements as the donor electron can be localized to particular impurities with relative ease by means of appropriate gate placement and\nvoltage pulses. Microwave driven experiments have already been proposed to investigate the parameter space\nand physical operation of such devices [18]. Precision\nplacement of a few donors has also been achieved recently, highlighting the urgency for a detailed theoretical\nstudy of a full charge qubit device before its physical realization is achieved [17]. Charge qubits also form the\nbuilding blocks of the coherent charge transfer mecha-\n\nnism proposed in Ref [19]. In such a scheme, quantum in\nformation encoded in the spin or in the charge of a donor\nelectron can be transported coherently through a chain of\nionized donors by an adiabatic pathway realized through\nvoltage pulses applied to electrical gates. Termed as Coherent Tunneling Adiabatic Passage (CTAP), this mechanism may provide a robust way to transfer information\nin a circuit of donor spin qubits [20, 21].\nAn important parameter of interest in a P2 + molecule\nis the tunnel coupling between the two impurity quantum dots defined by the coulomb potential of each donor\nnucleus. This coupling is expressed as the difference between the two lowest eigen states of the molecular system. A previous work [22] had utilized Kohn-Luttinger\n[23] type effective mass based variational envelope functions modulated by Bloch states of the six conduction\nband valleys of Si to show that the tunnel coupling suffers\nfrom the same sensitivity to relative donor placements as\nthe inter-donor exchange coupling for spin qubits. In Ref\n[24], the same approach was used to show that the tunnel\ncoupling can be controlled smoothly by constant electric\nfields for both homo and hetero polar donor species. As\nexperiments are getting closer to fabricating an actual\ndonor based charge qubit system [17], it is important to\ndevelop a detailed theoretical model that analyzes the\nvarious aspects of qubit control and design space, and\npredicts accurate numbers for quantities likely to be measured by experiments. Our goal in this paper is to serve\nthis very purpose by modeling the P2 + molecule with a\ncomprehensive numerical approach.\nWe employ atomistic tight-binding theory with a\nmodel for P impurity in Si that accurately captures the\nbasic single donor physics such as the valley-orbit split\ndonor spectrum. By solving the full tight-binding Hamiltonian for realistic systems of about 3 million atoms, we\nare able to obtain any number of states of the P2 + spectrum. Previous works [22, 24] on donor charge qubits\n\n\f2\nhave ignored the effects of the excited manifold on device\noperations. However, in the presence of significant gate\nbias, these excited states can disrupt normal device operation by entering the manifold of states used in quantum\ncomputing operations. Furthermore, effects of realistic\ngate potential profiles on the tunnel coupling need to be\ninvestigated as opposed to the simplistic constant electric fields used in earlier works. A gate can also cause\nsurface ionization of the bound electron at higher biases,\nthus limiting the control regime in practice. Presence\nof nearby interfaces can significantly distort the donor\nwave functions and affect charge qubit operations. Since\nthe previous works concentrated on bulk systems, these\neffects have been neglected.\nIn our tight-binding model coupled with electrostatic\ngate potentials from a commercial Poisson solver [25], we\ncan investigate all these effects under one framework with\nconsiderable accuracy. It is also important to go beyond\nthe effective mass theory (EMT) assumptions of only\nthe valley minima states contributing to the donor wave\nfunctions, and to consider a more comprehensive Bloch\nstructure of Si as is done in tight-binding. In the case\nof inter-qubit exchange coupling for spin qubits, Wellard\n[26] showed that oscillations of the exchange coupling\nJ(V) could be damped to some extent if an extended\nset of Bloch states is considered rather than the six valley minima states to expand the donor wave function.\nWellard et al. [26] also calculated the angular dependence of J(V) for a fixed radial separation of donors, and\nshowed that a gate bias was not able to alter J(V) significantly for certain angular separations between donors.\nIt remains to be seen if the tunnel coupling also suffers\nfrom this controllability problem.\nThis paper is organized into three parts. In Section\nI, the geometry of a P donor based charge qubit in Si\nis described, and the various control parameters studied\nhere are outlined. In Section II, the details of the tightbinding method is described. Section III presents the\nresults and discusses the controllability issues in detail.\n\nFIG. 1: The schematic of a donor based charge qubit device\nshowing the various design parameters. The surface gate voltage VS detunes the charge states of the donor molecule, while\nthe barrier gate voltage VB controls the tunneling barrier between the donors.\n\nDL from the lateral interfaces. Typical devices have dimensions 50 nm \u00d7 40 nm \u00d7 30 nm. While a larger device\nvolume would be ideal, the compute times increase much\nmore making the problem intractable. This device volume, however, captures most of the Physics of the double\ndonor molecule.\nFirst, we study the molecular spectrum of the system\nwithout any gate voltage taking into account the complicated band structure of Si. Then we investigate how this\nspectrum, and in particular the tunnel coupling, can be\ncontrolled by surface and barrier gates. Effects of design\nparameters such as LS , DV , R, \u0398, VS , and VB are also\nexplored. In particular, the energy gaps \u220612 and \u220623 are\nstudied. The energy gap \u220612 represents the energy difference between the 1st excited state (S2 ) and the ground\nstate (S1 ), while \u220623 represents the energy difference between the 2nd excited state(S3 ) and the 1st. The device\nschematic and notations of Fig 1 is used throughout this\npaper. The molecular states are labeled as S1 , S2 , S3 ,\nand so on, from more strongly bound to less (S1 being\nthe ground state).\n\nII. P2 + DONOR DEVICE GEOMETRY\n\nIII. TIGHT BINDING SOLUTION OF THE\nSOLID-STATE DONOR MOLECULAR SYSTEM\n\nA schematic of a P2 + donor molecular device in [001]\ngrown Si is illustrated in Fig 1. The P donors are separated by a distance R nm and an angle \u0398 measured from\nthe [100] axis. The donors form a molecular system analogous to H2 + except the Si band structure complicates\nthe scenario. A barrier gate (B-gate) is placed midway\nbetween the impurities and controls the potential barrier between them. A surface gate (S-gate) is placed a\ndistance LS (measured with respect to the center of the\nS-gate) away from the left impurity, and controls the detuning of the impurity states. the oxide thickness Tox is\n5 nm, while the gate lengths are 10 nm. The impurities\nare buried at a depth DV below the oxide and a distance\n\nThe approach used here is the semi-empirical tightbinding (TB) method [27] with the 20 band sp3 d5 s\u2217\nnearest-neighbor model. In this method, the Hamiltonian is expressed in real space with a basis of localized\natomic orbitals. The 20 band TB parameters for Si are\noptimized by genetic algorithm [28, 29] to reproduce the\nbulk band structure of the host. Once a set of such parameters are found, it can be used for atomistic modeling\nof a generic device made of the host. A single P impurity\nis represented by a coulomb potential screened by the\ndielectric constant of Si (\u01ebSi ) and subjected to a cut-off\npotential U0 at the impurity site. This core correcting\npotential U0 is adjusted to reproduce the single donor\n\n\f3\n\ne2\n4\u03c0\u01ebSi |R1 \u2212 R2 |\n\n+ eVG (VS , VB )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first term is the crystal Hamiltonian of Si, the\nsecond and third terms the potential energy due to the\ntwo donor nulcei, the 4th term the nuclear repulsion of\nthe two positively charged impurity cores, and the last\nterm the potential energy due to the surface and barrier\ngates obtained from a commercial Poisson Solver [25].\nThe single impurity potential is expressed as,\n\n\u221225\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221235\n\n\u221235\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221245\n\u221250\n\nr = Ri\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere Ri is the location of the i-th impurity. Interfaces\nare treated by closed boundary conditions with a model\nof surface passivation of dangling bonds [30]. The full\natomistic Hamiltonian of about 3 million Si atoms was\nsolved by a parallel Lanczos / Block Lanczos algorithm to\nobtain the eigenvalues and wavefunctions in the desired\nenergy range [29]. Each data point in this work required\nabout 6 hours on 48 processors [31].\nThe tight-binding method used here is under the hood\nof the the Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool (NEMO-3D)\n[29, 32], and had been successfully used to verify Stark\nshift of the hyperfine coupling between a donor and its\nnucleus [12] in good agreement with experiments [5] and\nwith momentum space methods [10]. The same method\nwas also applied to investigate the orbital Stark shift of a\ndonor-interface well system, and was verified with single\ndonor transport experiments in FinFETs [3].\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA. The molecular spectrum of P2 + at zero gate bias\n\nThe lowest 6 states of a single Group V donor in Si\nare of 1s type due to the six-fold degenerate conduction band minima of Si. The sharp confining potential in\nthe vicinity of the donor nucleus causes coupling between\nthe valleys, a phenomena termed as valley-orbit (VO) or\nchemical splitting. The net effect of the VO interaction\nis a splitting of the 6 1s states into a singlet (A1 ), triplet\n(T2 ) and a doublet (E1 ) orbital manifolds. The strength\nof this VO interaction varies from one donor species to\nanother, and is caused by a number of microscopic properties such as variation of the dielectric constant of Si\nfrom its bulk value, local strain originating from bonds\nbetween the donor and the Si atoms, and so on.

The binding energies\nshow smooth exponential decay with donor separation R\nfor impurities separated along [100] (Fig. 2a), but exhibit some oscillatory behavior for impurities separated\nalong [110] (Fig 2b), consistent with EMT descriptions\n[22]. For large enough R, the bonding and anti-bonding\npairs become almost degenerate, and the binding energies reduce to the single P binding energies with double degeneracies. At small R, the bonding state arising\nfrom one of the T2 states of each donor approaches the\nanti-bonding state arising from A1 states, causing \u220623\nto be comparable in magnitude to \u220612 . This situation\nis undesirable in quantum computer architectures since\nthe qubit Hilbert space, which usually consists of the\ntwo lowest eigenstates, needs to be well-isolated in energy from the rest of the manifold. A well-isolated qubit\nHilbert space makes the qubit less prone to decoherence\nand errors during operation. In this paper, we will use\n\u220612 = \u220623 as a threshold reference level for device operation. If \u220612 > \u220623 , the device is in an undesirable\noperation regime.

In the device geometry shown in\nFig 1, a positive bias to the surface gate lowers the potential of the left impurity relative to the right impurity.\nThe A1 state of the left donor moves farther below that\nof the right donor, and this increases \u220612 . The T2 state\nof the left donor moves closer to the A1 state of the right,\nwhich decreases \u220623 . Fig 3a and 3b show the variation of\n\u220612 and \u220623 respectively with an S-gate voltage for three\ndifferent donor separations along [100]. For larger impurity separations, the slopes of the \u220612 and \u220623 curves are\nsteeper. If the impurity separations are larger, then the\nleft impurity experiences a stronger S-gate potential than\nthe right impurity. If the impurities are closer, then the\nsame surface gate voltage provides less potential drop between the two impurities, and the surface gate response\nis weaker.\nTo elucidate the different voltage regimes shown in Fig\n3, it is helpful to look at the first three eigen states of\nthe whole device (top 3 rows of Fig 4) along with the\nnet electrostatic potential profile the device is operating\nunder (bottom row of Fig 4). Each column in Fig 4\nillustrates a snapshot of the donor molecule for a specific\nsurface gate voltage with two donors separated by 15.2\nnm along [100] (points marked by square data points in\nFig 3).\nAt VS = 0 (col. 3), the two donor wells are aligned\nin energy, giving rise to bonding and anti-bonding pairs.\nThe lowest two states (S1 & S2 ) are formed from the\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric superpositions of the A1\nstate of each donor. S3 is a bonding state arising from\nthe T2 states.\nAs VS is ramped up to 0.2 V (col. 4), the device is\nin the linear operation regime shown in Fig 3. The left\nimpurity is lower in energy than the right, giving rise to\na left localized ground state (A1 of left P) and a right\n\nFIG. 4: The three lowest states of the donor molecule at\nvarious surface gate voltages. The bottom row shows the\nnet electrostatic potential in the device, while the top 3 rows\nshows the first 3 wave function probability amplitudes. Each\ncolumn represents the device at a specific voltage.\n\nlocalized first excited state (A1 of right P), while state 3\narises from the T2 state of the left impurity. A plot of\nthe total potential shows that the surface gate expands\nthe potential contours of the left impurity relative to the\nright.\nIf the S-gate voltage is reversed in polarity to -0.2 V\n(column 2), the effects described above are reversed between the two impurities, with a right localized state appearing as the ground state.\nAt VS = 0.5 V (col. 5), a surface well is formed near\nthe gate, and quantum states begin to appear in this\nwell. In a finite sized nanostructure like this, whether\nthe lowest states are at the surface or at the donor is\ndetermined by which well is lower in energy. At VS = 0.5\nV, the surface well is almost as deep as the donor well.\nWhile the ground state of the system is still seen to occur\nin the left donor, the higher states occur in the surface\nwell. A small increase in bias at this point moves the\ninterface well deeper than the donor well, and produces\nionization of the donor electron. For a donor close to\nthe surface, the donor well can strongly couple to the\ninterface well, and give rise to the prospect of adiabatic\nionization [3, 11, 33, 34, 35]. Since the gate confined\nsurface states are closely spaced in energy compared to\nthe donor states, both \u220612 and \u220623 show a sharp decrease\nat the onset of this ionization process, as shown in Fig 3.\nAt VS = \u22120.5 V (col. 1), the interface well is raised\nin energy, and does not play a role. The gate voltage\nis high enough to push the T2 state of the right donor\nbelow the A1 of the left donor. When this happens, any\nsubsequent change of the gate bias causes a small change\nin \u220612 , and it flattens out, as shown in Fig 3a for the R =\n15.2 and 20.1 nm curves. This is expected as \u220612 is now\n\n\f5\nequal to the splitting betweeb the A1 and T2 of the the\nsame donor, and has a much weaker field response. The\n\u220623 curve captures the energy gap between the higher\nstates of the same donor, and tends to flatten out also.\nThe tunnel couplings therefore saturate in this voltage\nregime.\nSince \u220612 is to be less than \u220623 for the donor device,\nthe linear regimes about VS = 0 are important for coherent operations. The operational basis can be either\nthe left and right localized states at modest bias (linear\nregime), or the bonding and anti-bonding states near zero\nbias [16]. The ionization regime at high positive bias can\nbe important if the donor electron is to be shuttled from\none donor to another by transport along the interface [15]\nor if a measurement at the surface is to be performed [33].\n\n1.4\n\n12\n\n1.2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u039423 (meV)\n\nR: 10.8 nm\nR: 15.2 nm\nR: 20.1 nm\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nR: 10.8 nm\nR: 15.2 nm\nR: 20.1 nm\n\n6\n\n12\n\n4\n\n0.4\n\na)\n\u22120.5\n\nb)\n\n2\n\n0.2\n0\n\n8\n\n0\nVb (V)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n10\n0\nVb (V)\n\n0.5\n\n\u0394 12 (meV)\n\n\u039412 (meV)\n\nC. Barrier gate control\n\ntive B-gate lowers the potential in the barrier regions,\nand binds the electron more tightly between the donors,\nthe symmetric-anti-symmetric gap increases. Although a\nnegative S-gate bias causes detuning of the two impurities, it also lowers the potential in the barrier region, and\nthus compensates for the positive barrier gate. Hence,\nto obtain the same zero-field symmetric-anti-symmetric\ngap, a negative S-gate bias is needed, which explains the\nshift of the \u220612 -VS curve towards a negative VS when VB\nis held positive.\nSince the gates are separated by 15 nm in this case,\nthere is significant cross-talk between them. A positive Sgate therefore makes the surface well near B-gate deeper,\nand vice versa. As a result the ionization regime shifts\nto the left with increasing B-gate bias.\nSimultaneous S and B gate biases can be used to initialize the donor molecule system. At first, each donor\nhas one electron bound to it. To form a P2 + molecule,\none electron has to removed. This can be done by holding VB negative so as to raise the barrier between the left\nand the right donors, while applying a simultaneous positive bias to the S-gate to ionize the left donor electron\nto the surface well.\n\n8\n\nVb: 0.1 V\nVb: 0.3 V\nVb:\u22120.3 V\nVb:\u22120.5 V\n\n6\n4\n2\n\nFIG. 5: Barrier gate response of a) \u220612 and b) \u220623 for three\ndifferent donor separations with the donors 20.1 nm (DV )\nbelow the oxide.\n\nIn contrast to a surface gate, a barrier gate subjects\nboth donors to a similar potential. A positive barrier gate\nlowers the potential in the region between the two impurities, and increase hybridization of the left and right\ndonor states. A negative barrier gate raises the potential of this region, and provides more localization of the\nsingle donor states to each impurity. \u220612 and \u220623 are affected less by B-Gates than S-Gates, as exhibited by the\nsmaller slopes of the \u220612 -VB curves of Fig 5 compared to\nthose of Fig 3. The B-Gate also generates an interface\nwell which eventually ionizes the donors at high enough\ngate bias, causing a sharp fall in \u220612 and \u220623 .\nFig 6 shows how the tunnel coupling is affected when\nboth S-gate and B-gate biases are present simultaneously.\nIn each curve, the B-gate is held fixed at some voltage,\nand the S-gate is varied over a range of -0.5 V to 0.5\nV. It was shown in Fig 3 that at zero B-Gate bias, the\n\u220612 -VS curve shows a minimum at VS = 0. In the presence of a positive (negative) B-gate bias, this minimum\nshifts to a negative (positive) VS value.

Sensitivity to Donor Placement\n\nIn this section, we investigate the sensitivity of the tunnel coupling to relative donor placements along different\ndirections. In Fig 7, the radial separation between the\ndonors is held fixed at 10.8 nm, while the angular separation is varied from 0 to 450 at a fixed impurity depth\nof 20.1 nm. \u220612 and \u220623 are plotted in Fig 7a and 7b\nrespectively for three different gate configurations.\nAlthough the tunnel coupling shows some oscillatory\nbehavior with angular separation, both a barrier and a\nsurface gate voltage are each able to change the tunnel\ncoupling significantly. This shows that there is enough\ngate controllability irrespective of how the donors are\nplaced relative to each other.

Design issues: Gate placement and donor depth\n\n\u0394 12 (meV)\n\npling J(V) in Ref [26]. In contrast to the result obtained\nhere, the J(V) curve exhibited some gate controllability issues. For certain angular separations between the\ndonors, a gate voltage was not able to alter the magnitude\nof J(V) significantly. The absence of such controllability\nissues in this case is quite encouraging.\n\nof Fig 8b has a steeper slope for [111] donor separations\ncompared to the [100] and [110] separations.\nSimilarly, for [111] donor separations, an S-gate may be\nalmost equidistant from the two donors, and can act as a\nB-gate, thus reducing the voltage response of \u220612 significantly. This is evident by the smaller slope of the [111]\ncurve of Fig 8a compared to the other two curves. For the\ndevice structure considered here with donor separations\nalong [111], the radial distances between the S-gate center and the left and right donors were 26.7 nm and 25.1\nnm respectively. This shows that donor depth below the\ngate is an important feature in experimental design as\nsurface gates can act as barrier gates and vice-versa for\ncertain donor orientations.\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nVs (V)\n\nb)\n\na)\n\u22120.5\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\nVs (V)\n\n0.5\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nVb (V)\n\nFIG. 8: a) Surface and b) barrier gate response of \u220612 for\ndonors separated along three different directions. The device\nparameters: R=15.2 nm, LS =10.86 nm, DV =20.1 nm for\nR[100] and R[111].\n\nFigures 3 and 5 demonstrated smooth gate control\nover donors separated along [100]. Fig 8 demonstrates\nthat such smooth control also exists for donors separated\nalong other directions. In addition, Fig 8 also demonstrates some geometry effects that need to be considered\nin practical devices. Fig 8a shows the effect of an S-gate\non \u220612 for donors separated along three different directions, while Fig 8b shows the same for a B-Gate.\nThe striking feature of the curves is the asymmetry\nin voltage control between the [111] separation and the\nother two directions. If both impurities are not on the\nsame xz plane (Fig 1), which happens for [111] separation, then a B-gate may subject one donor to a higher\npotential than the other. This is more pronounced if the\ndonor depths below the gate are unequal by more than\ntens of lattice constants. In such a case, a B-gate can act\nas an S-gate, and the voltage response curve \u220612 -VB can\nshow a significantly larger response. The \u220612 -VB curve\n\nFIG. 9: Effect of surface gate placement on \u220612 . b) S-gate\nresponse of \u220612 for different donor depths. The impurities\nare separated by 15.2 nm along [100].\n\nFig 9a shows the effect of varying the distance between\nthe S-gate and the left impurity for two donors separated\nby 15.2 nm along [100]. The slope of the \u220612 -VS curve is\nsensitive to LS because it determines the potential contours the two impurities reside on. are on similar potential contours. It is seen that the slopes of the curves are\nthe steepest when LS is between 10.8 and 20.1 nm, suggesting that there may be an optimal gate distance from\ndonor for design purposes. A small LS of 0 or 5.5 nm\nis likely to subject both impurities to a strong potential.\nAs a result, the detuning is less responsive.\nIn Fig 9b, we show how the S-gate response of the\ntunnel coupling is modified for two different donor depths\nbelow the oxide. For both donors at a shallower depth of\n10.8 nm, the \u220612 -VS curve is steeper because proximity\nof the donors to the gate lends more control. The curve\nis also seen to flatten off before reaching the ionization\nregime. This is because the stronger potential brings the\nT2 state of left impurity below A1 state of the right, and\ncauses the tunnel coupling to become saturated before\nionization is reached. Any further increase in VS after\n0.2 V, simply captures the energy gap between the A1\nand T2 states of the left impurity. In contrast, the curve\n\n\f7\nfor 20.1 nm depth reaches ionization directly after the\nlinear regime.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nGate control of a P2 + molecular system was investigated in detail from a tight-binding approach. It was\nfound that excited states can place a limit on the range\nof operating voltages and donor separations. This arises\nfrom the necessity that the qubit Hilbert space needs to\nbe sufficiently isolated from the other states of the system\nfor robust coherent operation. Realistic TCAD [25] gate\npotentials were used to demonstrate that smooth controllability exists over the molecular states of the donors.\nThe detuning of two donors by a surface gate in various\nvoltage regimes was analyzed. It was also shown that the\ntunnel coupling is more sensitive to S-gate control than\nB-gate, with the exception of certain donor orientations\nfor which the S-gate can act like a B-gate and vice versa.\nSimultaneous operation with both S and B gates was\nshown to shift the minimum energy gap to non-zero gate\nconfigurations. Practical control of such a system is also\nlimited by interface ionization, and voltage regimes were\nestablished where this could take place. Sensitivity of\nthe tunnel coupling to donor placement was also investigated. Although the tunnel coupling exhibits oscillatory\nbehavior with donor separations in certain directions, it\nwas found that a gate voltage was always able to magnify\nit significantly. This confirms that the tunnel coupling\nis free from the voltage controllability issue observed in\nJ(V) [26].\nThe purpose of this work was to highlight the controllability and design issues that an experimental implementation and control of a P2 + molecular system would\ninvolve. The focus here has been not only on the physical\ntrends, but also on quantitative characterization of some\nquantities that are of interest to experimentalists. This\nP2 + molecule forms the building blocks of structures that\ncan utilize CTAP to transport information across qubits.\nRealization of CTAP in an actual donor array is likely to\ninvolve very precise gate control over quantum states of\ncoupled donors. This work lays the foundation for further work on CTAP that involves precision gate control\nto realize an adiabatic path for population transfer across\ndonor arrays.\nAcknowledgement: This work was supported by the\nAustralian Research Council, the Australian Government, and the US National Security Agency (NSA), and\nthe Army Research Office (ARO) under contract number\nW911NF-08-1-0527.
