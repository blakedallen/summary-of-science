The structure of K \u2212 pp reveals a molecular\nfeature, namely, the K \u2212 in \u039b\u2217 as an \"atomic center\" plays a key role in producing\nstrong covalent bonding with the other proton. We point out that strongly bound\nK\u0304 nuclear systems are formed by \"super strong\" nuclear force due to migrating real\nbosonic particles K\u0304 a la Heitler-London-Heisenberg, whereas the normal nuclear\nforce is caused by mediating virtual pions. We have shown that the elementary\nprocess, p + p \u2192 K + + \u039b\u2217 + p, which occurs in a short impact parameter and with a\nlarge momentum transfer, leads to unusually large self-trapping of \u039b\u2217 by the involved\nproton, since the \u039b\u2217 -p system exists as a compact doorway state propagating to\nK \u2212 pp.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1932, right after the discovery of the neutron, Heisenberg [1] tried to explain the nuclear\nforce (for instance, the proton-neutron interaction) with the idea of \"Platzwechsel\" of a\nmigrating particle, which had been known as the mechanism for the covalency in hydrogen\nmolecule, first clarified by Heitler and London in 1927 [2]. This \"molecule-type bonding\"\nmechanism can be written as\nHeitler \u2212 London \u2212 Heisenberg : e\u2212 p + p \u2194 p + e\u2212 p.\n\n(1)\n\nSince the \"e\u2212 p\" cannot be identified to the neutron for obvious reasons, this idea was\nunsuccessful, and was abandoned. Instead of a \"migrating real\" particle, Yukawa [3]\nintroduced a \"mediating virtual\" boson for explaining the nuclear force as\nNuclear force by Yukawa : p \u2194 \u03c0 + + n, n \u2194 \u03c0 \u2212 + p.\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fThis hypothetical particle was eventually discovered, and Yukawa' s idea of a mediating\nvirtual particle was established as the fundamental concept for understanding all the\nforces including the electroweak interaction. In the present paper we point out that the\nK\u0304 meson, as a \"real migrating\" particle, plays a unique role in producing strong bonding\nof nucleons as\nSuper strong nuclear force : K \u2212 p + p \u2194 p + K \u2212 p.\n(3)\nOne can say that this is the revival of the forgotten Heitler-London-Heisenberg scheme\nfor nuclear binding force. In the following sections we describe briefly how this view has\ncome out from our theoretical studies of an exotic bound system K \u2212 pp. We also foresee\nperspectives of this view toward kaon condensation. Full accounts of the results will be\npublished soon [4, 5].\n\n2\n\nKaonic nuclear bound states\n\nRecently, exotic light nuclear systems involving a K\u0304 (K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 ) meson as a constituent\nhave been predicted based on phenomenologically constructed K\u0304N interactions [6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11]. The basic ingredient for this new family of nuclear states, often called kaonic\nnuclear clusters, is the strongly attractive I = 0 K\u0304N interaction, which accommodates the\nK \u2212 p bound state, identified to the known \u039b(1405) resonance in the \u03a3\u03c0 channel (hereafter,\nexpressed as \u039b\u2217 ) with a binding energy of BK = 27 MeV and a width of \u0393 = 40 MeV [12].\nSince the \u039b(1405) resonance is largely populated in the K \u2212 absorption at rest in 4 He [13]\nand also in nuclear emulsion [14], it is very likely to be the I = 0 K\u0304N bound state. The\nK\u0304N interaction was also derived theoretically (see, for instance, Refs. [15, 16]).\nThe most spectacular property of the predicted kaonic nuclei is in their extremely\nhigh densities; the average density, \u03c1av \u223c 0.5 fm\u22123 , reaches about 3 times as much as\nthe normal nuclear density \u03c10 \u223c 0.17 fm\u22123 . This is an enormous contrast to the normal\nnuclear systems, in which the nuclear density is always a constant. The K\u0304 produces extra\nbinding of nucleons, which overcompensate the stiff nuclear incompressibility. In order to\nunderstand this feature we study the most fundamental unit, K \u2212 pp.\nThe lightest system following the \"\u039b(1405) = K \u2212 p Ansatz\", K \u2212 pp, was predicted to\nexist with M = 2322 MeV/c2 , BK = 48 MeV and \u0393 = 61 MeV [7]. Recently, Faddeev calculations have been carried out to obtain the pole corresponding to K \u2212 pp by Shevchenko\net al. [17] and by Ikeda and Sato [18]. Their results are consistent with ours.\n\n3\n\nStructure of K \u2212 pp\n\nIn our study the ATMS variational method [19] was employed together with the bare\nK\u0304N interaction of AY [6] and the bare NN interaction of Tamagaki [20]. The three-body\nvariational wave function of K\u0304NN with a number definition (1, 2, 3) = (K\u0304, N, N) is given\nas\n\u03a8 = [\u03a612 + \u03a613 ] |T = 1/2 >\n(4)\n2\n\n\fwhere\nI=0\nI=1\n\u03a612 = [f I=0 (r12 ) P12\n+ f I=1(r12 ) P12\n] \u00d7 fN N (r23 )f (r31 ),\nI=0\nI=0\nI=1\n\u03a613 = f (r12 )fN N (r23 ) \u00d7 [f (r31 ) P31 + f I=1(r31 ) P31\n],\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nI=0\nI=1\nwith P12\n= (1 \u2212 \u03c4~K * \u03c4~N )/4 and P12\n= (3 + \u03c4~K * \u03c4~N )/4. The functions f I=0 (rij ) and\nf I=1 (rij ) are scattering correlation functions of the particle pair (i, j) for the I = 0 and\nI = 1 K\u0304N interactions, respectively, and fN N (r23 ) is that for the NN pair, and f (ri,j ) is\nfor the off-shell case. The T = 1/2 state consists of two isospin eigenstates as\n\n|T = 1/2 >=\n\ns\n\n3\n(K\u03041 N2 )0,0 p3 +\n4\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\ns\n\n\u0014 s\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n(K\u03041 N2 )1,0 p3 +\n4\n3\n\ns\n\n2\n(K\u03041 N2 )1,1 n3 ,\n3\n\u0015\n\n(7)\n\nwhere (K\u03041 N2 )I,Iz is for the isospin (I, Iz ). Among these the first term corresponds to \u039b\u2217 p.\nThe predicted structure of K \u2212 p and K \u2212 pp is shown in Fig. 1. The \"nucleus\" pp does\nnot exist, but the K \u2212 can combine two protons into a strongly bound system, when they\nare in a spin-singlet state.\n\nFigure 1: (Upper) Schematic structure of K \u2212 p and K \u2212 pp. (Lower Left) The effective potentials for relative motions of N-(K\u0304N) and K\u0304-(NN), deduced from the exact variational\nwavefunction for K \u2212 pp. The K\u0304-N potential in \u039b(1405) is also shown. (Lower Middle)\nDensity distributions of various coordinates in K \u2212 pp as well as \u039b(1405) = K \u2212 p. (Lower\nRight) Comparison of the density distributions, r 2 \u03c1(rKN ), of the K\u0304-N distance in the\nK\u0304N pair in \u039b(1405) and in K \u2212 pp. The latter is decomposed into the I = 0 and I = 1\npairs. The density distribution in \u039b(1405) after multiplication of a factor 0.625 is also\nshown.\nThe effective potential energies as functions of the relative distances of K\u0304-(NN) and\nN-(K\u0304N) are extracted from the obtained total wave function, as shown in Fig. 1 (Left).\n3\n\n\fThe distributions of the relative distances and the momenta of the constituent particle\npairs, namely, K\u0304-N, K\u0304-(NN), (K\u0304N)-N, and N-N, were calculated, as shown in the\nmiddle. For comparison the K\u0304-N density distribution in free \u039b\u2217 is also shown. The NN rms distance is 1.90 fm, which is significantly smaller than the average inter-nucleon\ndistance in normal nuclei (2.2 fm [21]), and is much smaller than the rms distance of p-n\nin d (3.90 fm). The rms radius of K\u0304 with respect to (NN) is 1.35 fm, close to the rms\ndistance of K\u0304-N in \u039b(1405), 1.36 fm.\nWe compare in Fig. 1 (Right) the K\u0304-N distance distribution of the K\u0304N pair in K \u2212 pp,\nrms\n= 1.57 fm) is signif\u03c1K\u0304\u2212N (K \u2212 pp), with that in \u039b(1405), \u03c1K\u0304\u2212N (\u039b\u2217 ). The former (RK\u0304\u2212N\nicantly broader than the latter (1.36 fm). We decompose the density distribution into\nthe K\u0304N I=0 and K\u0304N I=1 parts, as shown. The I = 0-pair distribution has a shape closer\nto \u03c1K\u0304\u2212N (\u039b\u2217 ), whereas the I = 1 part is widely distributed due to the smaller attractive\ninteraction. When K \u2212 (1) resides with Proton (2) with a probability of 0.5, the I = 0\ncomponent of the wave function \u03a612 in (5) dynamically increases to 1 due to the strong\nK\u0304N I=0 interaction. Adding an intensity (0.5 \u00d7 1/4 = 0.125) from Proton (3), we expect\nthe total intensity to be 0.625 \u03c1K\u0304\u2212N (\u039b\u2217 ), which accounts for the calculated \u03c1K\u0304\u2212N (K \u2212 pp)\nvery well. This means that K \u2212 (1) in K \u2212 pp resides partially around Proton (2) in a\nform of \u039b(1405), and partially around Proton (3), as given by the total wave function.\nThis indicates that the structure of \u039b(1405) is nearly unchanged when it dissolves into\nthis \"nucleus\". In other words, the \u039b(1405) state, though modified, persists in a nuclear\nsystem. This aspect justifies the \u039b(1405) doorway model [7].\n\n4\n\nMolecular aspect of K \u2212 pp and super strong nuclear\nforce\n\nThe present kaonic nuclear cluster K \u2212 pp can be interpreted as a kaonic hydrogen molecular ion in the sense that K \u2212 migrates between the two protons, producing \"strong\ncovalency\" through the strongly attractive K\u0304N I=0 interaction. This is essentially the\nmechanism of Heitler and London [2] for hydrogen molecule, though the nature of the\ninteraction is totally different and the migrating particle is much heavier and bosonic.\nFigure 2 (Left) shows the adiabatic potential (V (R) R2 ), when a proton approaches a\n\u039b(1405) particle, as a function of the p-p distance. The deep potential indicates that\na proton approaching from a distant place to an isolated \u039b\u2217 gets quickly trapped and\ndissolved into the bound state of K \u2212 pp.\nFigure. 2 (Right) shows the projected distribution of K \u2212 along the p-p axis and the\ncontour distribition of K \u2212 , when the p-p distance is fixed to 2.0 fm (this case resembles the\nground state of K \u2212 pp, as the calculated rms distance is 1.9 fm). The K \u2212 is distributed,\nnot around the center of p-p, but around each of the two protons. The K \u2212 distribution is\ncomposed of the \"atomic\" part, as shown by brown dotted curves, and the exchange part\n(green broken curve) a la Heitler and London.\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: (Left) The adiabatic potential (V (R) R2 ), when a proton approaches a bound\nK \u2212 p \"atom\" (\u039b\u2217 ), as a function of the distance between p and p. For comparison the\nTamagaki potential for the normal VN N interaction is shown. (Right) The molecular\nstructure of K \u2212 pp. The projected density distributions of K \u2212 in K \u2212 pp with a fixed p \u2212 p\ndistance (= 2.0 fm) and the corresponding K \u2212 contour distribution are shown,\nWe emphasize that the strong I = 0 K\u0304N attraction produces a large exchange integral,\nX\n\n< \u03a61i |vK\u0304N (12) + vK\u0304N (13)|\u03a61j >= \u221252.6 MeV,\n\n(8)\n\n{i,j}={2,3},{3,2}\n\nwhich is the source for the deeper binding of K \u2212 pp as compared with K \u2212 p. Despite the\ndrastic dynamical change of the system caused by the strong K\u0304N interaction the identity\nof the \"constituent atom\", \u039b\u2217 , is nearly preserved because of the presence of a short-range\nrepulsion between the two protons. The molecule K \u2212 pp resembles a tightly bound \u039b\u2217 -p,\nwhich we call \u039b\u2217 p doorway in the formation process.\nThus, we have demonstrated that the strong K\u0304N attraction produces a very strong\nmolecular type bonding of the two protons. This adiabatic potential (red curve) as shown\nin Fig 2 (Left) can be called Super Strong Nuclear Force, as compared with the ordinary\nnuclear force (green curve). Not only the depth of the potential, but also the long range\nattractive part due to the covalent nature and the relatively smaller short-range repulsive\npart produce an enormous binding in K\u0304-migrating nuclear systems, as shown in Fig 2\n(Left). The \"super strong\" / \"normal\" ratio of the volume integrated strength is 4.1.\n5\n\n\f5\n\nDominance of \u039b\u2217p doorway in K \u2212pp production in\nN N collisions\n\nWe expect that the K \u2212 pp state as a \u039b\u2217 p composite can be formed in the p + p reaction:\np + p \u2192 K + + (\u039b\u2217 p) \u2192 K + + K \u2212 pp.\n\n(9)\n\nThe reaction diagram is shown in Fig. 3 (Left). Essentially, the spectral function for\n= K \u2212 pp is composed of the following three factors: i) the collision range 1/mB , taken\nto be the \u03c1 meson mass; mB = m\u03c1 = 770 MeV/c2 . ii) the momentum transfer, Q \u223c 1.6\nGeV/c, and iii) the structure function, depending on the rms distance R(\u039b\u2217 p) of the \u039b\u2217 -p\nsystem.\nThe calculated spectral function at Tp = 4 GeV at forward angle in the scale of\nE(\u039b\u2217 p) = 27 MeV \u2212 BK is presented in Fig. 3 (Right). Surprisingly, in great contrast to\nthe ordinary reactions, the spectral function is peaked at the bound state with only a small\nquasi-free component. This means that the sticking of \u039b\u2217 and p is extraordinarily large.\nThis dominance of \u039b\u2217 p sticking in such a large-Q reaction can be understood as originating\nfrom the matching of the small impact parameter with the small size of the bound state. It\nis vitally important to examine our results experimentally. An experimental observation\nof K \u2212 pp in pp collision may be revealed in a past experiment DISTO at Saclay [22] as\nwell as in a planned experiment at GSI [23]. If a bound-state peak is found, it will not\nonly confirm the existence of K \u2212 pp, but also prove the compactness of the K\u0304 cluster.\n\nFigure 3: (Left) Diagram for the p(p, K + )K \u2212 pp reaction. (Right) Calculated spectral\nshape for different rms distances R(\u039b\u2217 -p), arbitrarily chosen. The binding energy of\nK \u2212 pp is set to be 86 MeV for the K\u0304N interaction which is 17 % enhanced. In this case,\nR(\u039b\u2217 p) = 1.45 fm is realistic.\n\n6\n\n\f6\n\nWhy does K\u0304 produce shrunk nuclear systems?\n\nThe constancy of nuclear density, \u03c1 \u223c \u03c10 \u223c 0.17 fm\u22123 , which is believed to be almost the\nnuclear physics \"law\", results from the balance between the short-range nuclear repulsion\nand the long-range attraction of the ordinary nuclear force. In normal nuclei the average\ninter-nucleon distance is\ns\n3\ndN N \u223c 2 3\n\u223c 2.2 fm,\n(10)\n4\u03c0\u03c10\nwhen we adopt Bethe's estimate based on a close-packed sphere approximation [21]. The\nnucleon rms radius, rrms \u223c 0.86 fm, corresponds to a nucleon volume of vN \u223c 2.66 fm3\nand to a nucleon density of \u03c1N \u223c 0.38 fm\u22123 . This means that nucleons occupy the nuclear\nspace with a compaction factor of fc = \u03c1N /\u03c10 \u223c 2.3. This situation seems to be hardly\nchanged by the normal nuclear force.\nThe hard core part of the N-N interaction plays an essential role in keeping the nuclear\ndensity constant. In an intuitive picture it is related to the Pauli blocking in the u\u2212d quark\nsector. This situation is common for all hadron-hadron interactions except for the case\nof K\u0304, which, composed of s\u016b (K\u0304 0 ) or sd \u0304 (K \u2212 ), includes no (u, d) quark. Thus, the K\u0304N\ninteraction is expected to be dominated by the u \u2212 \u016b and d \u2212 d \u0304 attraction without shortrange repulsion. From this consideration we understand intuitively why normal nuclei are\ndifficult to compress and why only the K\u0304 meson produces dense nuclear systems. The\nintruding K\u0304 meson, as a \"messenger of \u016b/d \u0304 quark\", is expected not only to cause super\nstrong nuclear force by its strong binding and migration with protons, but also to relax\nthe NN repulsion due to a kind of \"anti-quark shielding\" effect: uud \u2212 s\u016b \u2212 uud. The\nlatter effect is not taken into account in our calculation, where the nucleons are treated\nas structureless elementary particles, but will certainly enhance the super strong nuclear\nforce.\nWhen the nuclear density exceeds the nucleon compaction factor, an additional effect\nmay come in, because the QCD vacuum is expected to vanish and chiral symmetry is\nrestored [24, 25, 26]. It is vitally important to investigate to what extent the involved\nhadrons keep their identities under such an extremely dense system.\n\n7\n\nThe super strong nuclear force toward kaon condensation\n\nWe have studied many other kaonic bound states [8]. The strong bonding produced by\na single K\u0304 was shown to saturate for 3-4 nucleons. We have also predicted the doubleK \u2212 clusters [9]. The species, K \u2212 K \u2212 pp, corresponds to the neutral hydrogen molecule,\nand has a large binding energy BKK = 117 MeV and a shrunk inter-nucleon distance,\nrms\nRN\n\u2212N = 1.3 fm [9]. Expecting that the kaonic bound states with a large number of K\u0304 will\nbe more deeply bound and stable, we proposed to search for them in high-energy heavy\nreactions [9].\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: (Left) Speculated K \u2212 p = \u039b\u2217 matter with a quasi-\u039b\u2217 as an \"atomic\" constituent,\nwhere K \u2212 's migrate among protons, producing high-density strange matter. (Right)\nSpeculated diagrams for the density dependences of the bound-state energies of various\nbaryon composite systems (pK \u2212 )m nn . The K\u0304N energy is represented by the red curve,\nand the nuclear compression by the black curve. The total energies for representative\nfractions of K \u2212 /N (=1/2, 1 and 3/2) are depicted by respective blue curves, showing\nminima at high density and low energy. Density-dependent enhanced K\u0304N interactions\nwith relativistic correction are assumed.\nWe can conceive a multi-K\u0304 system, as sketched in Fig. 4 (Left), where K \u2212 mesons\nmigrate coherently among protons. We speculate that the ground state of such a system\nshows a large energy gap. The above consideration naturally leads us to a regime of kaon\ncondensation [27, 28]. Namely, K\u0304 mesons, as intruders with \u016b and d \u0304 quarks, behave as\nstrong glue to combine surrounding nucleons to a dense system. The whole energy drops\ndown, depending on the composition of p, n and K\u0304. Intuitively, one can conceive energy\ndiagrams as shown in Fig. 4 (Right). There are three phases: the K\u0304 matter with energy\nEK (\u03c1), the \u039b matter with energy E\u039b (\u03c1) and the normal nuclear matter with EN (\u03c1). Only\nthe K\u0304 matter decreases in energy as the density increases. Then, there are three regimes\nfor the phase stability.\ni)\nii)\niii)\n\nEK (\u03c1) > E\u039b (\u03c1) : strong decay to \u039b\u2032 s\nEN (\u03c1) < EK (\u03c1) < E\u039b (\u03c1) : weak decay : \u03c4 \u223c sub \u2212 ns\nEN (\u03c1) > EK (\u03c1) : stable\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nKaonic nuclear clusters in the cases i) and ii) can be searched for in laboratory. The case\niii) corresponds to a stable kaonic matter which might exist as a strange star.\nIn the present paper we have clarified that the K\u0304 meson can produce an enormously\n8\n\n\fFigure 5: Summary of the three different interaction schemes for nuclear forces.
