Introduction\nThe X-ray emission from young supernova remnants\n(SNRs) provide a vital source of information about the\nproperties of shocked, rarefied plasma, properties of the\nambient medium around the remnants, and also about\nsupernova explosion models. With the current generation of X-ray telescopes, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and\nSuzaku, one can combine now the imaging and spectral\ninformation to study the extended emission from SNRs.\nMoreover, in the case of Chandra and XMM-Newton, dispersive spectrometers allows one to obtain high resolution\nspectra, providing more constraints on the plasma parameters, and on the dynamics of the plasma, through Doppler\nshifts and broadening. The XMM-Newton Reflection\nGrating Spectrometers (RGS) have the advantage that the\nspectral quality is less detoriated by the spatial extent of\nthe object, at least for sources with an angular extent of\n. 1 \u2032.\n\nFor that reason the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\nand the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) SNRs are particular well suited, since the relative proximity of the\nLMC means that many SNRs are bright enough to obtain high signal to noise spectra with both the CCD and\ngrating spectrometers. On the other hand, the distance of\nthe LMC, 50 kpc, is such that young SNRs have an extent less than 1 \u2032 , making them excellent targets for the\nXMM-Newton RGS. The XMM-Newton CCDs, with a\nresolution of \u223c 6 \u2032\u2032 , still allows one to study spatial variations, although Chandra obviously provides more spatial\ndetails. In addition, studying SMC/LMC remnants has the\nadvantage that the interstellar absorption is on average\nlower than for most of the Galactic remnants, and their\ndistance is known.\nXMM-Newton observations of several LMC/SMC\nremnants have been published: N132D (Behar et al.\n2001), 1E 0102.2-7219 (Rasmussen et al. 2001;\nSasaki et al. 2006), B0540-69.3 (van der Heyden et al.\n\n\f2\n\nKosenko et al.: The X-ray Spectra Of The SNR 0509-67.5\n\n2001), N103B (van der Heyden et al. 2002), and several\nSMC remnants (van der Heyden et al. 2004).\n\n2. The XMM-Newton data, reduction and\nanalysis\n\nHere we report on the X-ray spectrum of the\nSNR 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This\nobject was already examined by several authors, e.g.,\nWarren & Hughes (2004); Vink (2006); Badenes et al.\n(2008);\nRest et al.\n(2008);\nGhavamian et al.\n(2007); Rest et al. (2005); Badenes et al. (2007);\nHendrick & Reynolds (2001). The remnant has a spherical shape and is somewhat similar in age and size to\nTycho's SNR, which is also a Type Ia SNR. SNR 050967.5 has an angular diameter of 25\u2032\u2032 , corresponding\nto the radius of 3.6 pc (Warren & Hughes 2004). A\nrecent analysis by Rest et al. (2005), based on light echo\ndetection, and Badenes et al. (2008), based on modeling\nof the X-ray observation, suggest the age of the remnant\nto be \u223c 400 years. Estimates by Ghavamian et al. (2007)\ngives the values of 295 \u2212 585 years, consistent with the\nrough estimate \u223c 500 years by Vink (2006), based on a\npreliminary analysis of the XMM-Newton data.\n\nSNR 0509-67.5 was observed with the XMM-Newton Xray Observatory (obs ID 0111130201) for 35.9 ks on July\n4, 2000. The observatory contains three X-ray telescopes.\nBehind all of them are CCD detectors, collectively called\nthe European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC). Two of\nthem are MOS type CCD detectors called MOS1 and\nMOS2 (Turner et al. 2001), the other is of the pn-CCD\ntype (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001). The telescopes equipped with\nMOS CCD detectors in the focal plane contain also the\nReflective Grating Spectrometers (RGS), consisting of\nthe Reflective Grating Arrays, dispersing about 50% of\nthe X-rays to two CCD arrays (den Herder et al. 2001).\nXMM-Newton observations therefore provide simultaneous data from all five X-ray instruments: the two MOSCCDs, the pn-CCD, and the two RGS instruments.\nIn this paper we concentrate on the data obtained with\nthe MOS detectors and the RGS. Although the EPICMOS have a somewhat lower sensitivity than the EPIC-pn\ninstrument, they have better spectral resolution, which is\nimportant for line rich sources, such as SNRs.\nNote that Badenes et al. (2008) found an inconsistency between EPIC MOS1,2 and PN spectra. They investigated Si K\u03b1 line centroid location in the datasets of\nthese devices and found out that the line centroids of\nMOS and PN detectors are shifted with respect to each\nother. The authors rejected MOS1 and MOS2 data and\nconcentrated only on the Chandra and EPIC-pn spectra.\nWe confirm this inconsistency: analysis of the Si K\u03b1 centroid of MOS1,2 and PN data reveals that it is located at\n1.8503 \u00b1 0.0012 keV and 1.8298 \u00b1 0.0015 keV respectively (the errors are 1\u03c3 \u03c72 ). For the Fe K\u03b1 line we found\n6.495 \u00b1 0.048 keV and 6.442 \u00b1 0.025 keV. The discrepancies in the lines locations are about 1%. Nevertheless,\nthere are indications, that PN instrument has small gain\nproblems and sometimes a shifting of the PN energy\ngrid is required (private communications with N.Werner;\nWerner et al. 2006; de Plaa et al. 2004). Moreover, in our\nstudy, we were unable to find a fitting model with sensible\nparameters of the emitting plasma for the PN data, meanwhile a spectral model for the MOS data gives reasonable\nand satisfactory plasma parameters.\nThe EPIC data was slightly affected by background\nflaring (\"soft protons\"). As a result we cut out 3.4 ks of\nthe total observation. The MOS1 observation was done\nin small window mode, whereas the MOS2 data were\nmade in full frame mode. For MOS1, therefore, we could\nnot select a region to extract background spectra. For the\nMOS2 this was possible, but we found that the background correction was too small, and the account for it\ndid not change the fitted parameters. For that reason we\ndid not include background subtraction for our final analysis.\nThe RGS is a slitless spectrometer. For an extended\nsource this means that the spectrum is smeared by the\nimage of the source itself. For SMC/LMC remnants the\nsmearing is modest, but present, and it gives rise to\n\nA detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of\nSNR 0509-67.5 was made by Warren & Hughes (2004)\nand based on Chandra X-ray data. Their study revealed\nthat the remnant is rich in silicon, sulfur and iron, the bulk\nof the continuum emission has a non-thermal origin, and\nan estimate the circumstellar medium (CSM) density is\nof \u223c 0.05 cm\u22123 . The preferred model for the explosion\nwhich produced the remnant - is delayed detonation.\nRecently, Badenes et al. (2008) reported their study\nof the remnant's X-ray spectrum observed by Chandra\nand XMM-Newton observations. They performed hydrodynamical and X-ray spectral calculations of the remnant\nand concluded that it was an energetic, delayed detonation explosion of 1.4 \u00d7 1051 ergs with a nickel mass of\n0.97M\u2299 . In their numerical simulations the circumstellar\ndensity was set to nCSM = 0.4 cm\u22123 and the ratio of electron to ion temperatures to 0.02.\nFor illustrative purposes we show in Fig.1 some of\nthe Chandra X-ray images of the remnant in three different bands. The overall structure of the SNR shows a large\nscale inhomogeneity in the shell. The Southwest (SW)\npart of the remnant is somewhat brighter compared to the\naverage brightness.\nIn the current study we performed an analysis of the\nremnant employing XMM-Newton X-ray observations\nand spex fitting software (Kaastra et al. 1996). We also\nperformed hydrodynamical simulations of the SNR 050967.5, employing the hydrocode supremna (Sorokina et al.\n2004) to compare numerical predictions for the remnant\nwith the observations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First we describe\nbriefly the XMM-Newton data in \u00a72, then we discuss the\nX-ray spectrum in \u00a73. Numerical models for the SNR are\npresented in \u00a74. We discuss our results and outline them\nin \u00a75.\n\n\fKosenko et al.: The X-ray Spectra Of The SNR 0509-67.5\n\nFig. 1. Chandra images of the SNR 0509-67.5 in different\nX-ray ranges. From left to right: 0.45-1.75 keV, 1.8-2.5\nkeV, 2.5-6.0 keV (Warren & Hughes 2004).\n\na change in the line spread function. For our analysis\nwe incorporated this effect into the response matrix by\nconvoluting the standard (point source) response matrix\nwith the emissivity profile of the SNR, as obtained from\narchival Chandra observations. This procedure was also\nfor the RGS data of SN 1006 (Vink et al. 2003). As we\nshall show later, however, in the case of 0509-67.5 the\nDoppler line broadening is much larger than broadening\ndue to the spatial extent of the remnant.\nApart from adapting the RGS response matrix, all reduction for both MOS and RGS data was done using\nthe standard XMM-Newton software package SAS version 7.1.0.\n\n3. Spectral models\nThe X-ray spectra of the SNR were fitted with a nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) model, which is a part of\nthe spex fitting package (Kaastra et al. 1996). The package does not include a plane shock model (which takes\ninto account temperature and ionization timescale gradients), but it contains the most complete and up-todate set of atomic data. The use of a single ionization\ntimescale NEI model is justified in some cases, when\none needs to get rough estimates of basic SNR properties (e.g. Cassam-Chena\u0131\u0308 et al. 2004). The emission measure nH ne V in such a model can be used to estimate the\ncircumstellar medium density. Since continuum emission\nstems mostly from the shocked CSM, the value of nH can\ngive us directly an estimate of the unshocked environment\ndensity (depending on the assumed equation of state).\nCombined fitting of the spectra from RGS, EPIC:\nMOS1, MOS2 devices is presented in Fig.2.\n3.1. EPIC data\n3.1.1. Spectra parameters\n\nIn order to adequately fit the spectra we needed at least\ntwo thermal components: one NEI component is for the\nbulk of the X-ray line emission, and another one is\nto fit the Fe-K emission around 6.5 keV (see section\n3.1.2 for details on this component). We also investigated a model with an additional power law continuum,\nsince Warren & Hughes (2004) reported indirect evidence\nfor non-thermal continuum, probably synchrotron emission from > TeV electrons. The plasma parameters for the\n\n3\n\ntwo models are indicated in Table 1 as (th) and (th+pow).\nIn addition, we extracted also the spectrum from the enhanced SW region of the remnant. In general, the parameters are in agreement with the the ones obtained\nby Warren & Hughes (2004). The enhanced SW region\nshows higher ionization timescale, probably reflecting a\nhigher density.\nUsing the value of the emission measure, we can estimate the density of the CSM. Hydrogen emission measure (Table 1, MOS+RGS) is EM = ne nH V = 1.5 \u00d7\n1058 cm\u22123 and the remnant's size is R = 3.6 pc \u2243\n1019 cm. Assuming that the emitting shell has a width of\n\u2206R = R/12, so that the volume VX = Vtot /4 = \u03c0 R3 /3 \u2243\n1057 cm3 , we obtain ne nH \u2243 15 cm\u22126 . Furthermore, assuming that all the matter is ionized nH \u2243 4 cm\u22123 , we\nobtain that CSM number density for the remnant should\nbe nCSM \u2243 1 cm\u22123 for the neutral circumstellar environment, which appears to be the case for SNR 0509-67.5\n(Ghavamian et al. 2007). Here we assumed shock compression ratio to be 4 for non-relativistic matter with adiabatic index \u03b3 = 5/3. However, cosmic ray (CR) acceleration may play an important role in SNR dynamics. For a\ncosmic ray dominated shock the adiabatic approach that\nof a relativistic gas (\u03b3 = 4/3) gives rise to a compression factor of 7. Cosmic ray escape may even increase the\ncompression ratio beyond 7 (Berezhko & Ellison 1999).\nTycho's SNR provides some observational evidence for\nhigh compression factors (Warren et al. 2005). Therefore,\nin the case of 0509-67.5, the pre-shock density could be\nas low as nCSM . 0.6 cm\u22123 .\nAlso, two additional sources of uncertainty concerning the pre-shock density are the presence or absence\nof a non-thermal continuum, and chemical composition.\nIn particular, our above estimate assumes that most of\nthe continuum is bremsstrahlung from hydrogen-electron\ncollisions, whereas it is quite likely that parts of the\nremnant consist of pure metal plasmas, in which case\nbremsstrahlung comes from metal ions and the electrons\nthey provide, in general this lowers the density estimate.\nTherefore, our estimate of nCS M \u2243 1 cm\u22123 , should be considered as an upper limit.\nAbundances of chemical elements for the entire\nSNR (thermal and nonthermal continuum) and enhanced\nSW part for the simple NEI model are presented in\nFig.3. Abundances for some theoretical explosion models (Iwamoto et al. 1999; Woosley et al. 2007) are also\nshown. The accounting for the nonthermal continuum\ndoes not create a considerable difference in the abundances set, but naturally it makes the remnant more metalrich. One can see from the figure that the SW region is\nmore metal abundant compared to overall remnant values\n(2-3 times higher amount of metals).\nThe spex fitting shows no evidence for interstellar\nabsorption, which means that the value of NH is low\nfor this remnant. The column density value found by\nWarren & Hughes (2004) is NH \u2243 (5 \u2212 9) \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 .\nWhich is, indeed, the lowest value among all known LMC\nsupernovae remnants (Hughes et al. 1998).

Tycho's SNR or Cas A\nCassam-Chena\u0131\u0308 et al. 2006; Vink & Laming 2003). This\nvalue is close to the one obtained by Warren & Hughes\n(2004): 3.25 \u00b1 0.18. The extrapolation of the non-thermal\nradio flux (Hendrick & Reynolds 2001) to the X-ray\nrange yields F1keV = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 ph/s/cm2 /keV. Since\nthe X-ray synchrotron spectrum is likely to be affected by\nsynchrotron losses, this flux should be considered as an\nupper limit.\n3.1.2. Fe-K emission\n\nDespite of the low amount of iron in the shocked ejecta\ndeduced with single ionization timescale NEI model, the\nspectrum has a pronounced Fe K feature. Its centroid is\nlocated at 6.50 \u00b1 0.05 keV, which may correspond to\nthe ions from Fe VII (Kaastra & Mewe 1993) with ne t \u2243\n109 s/cm3 up to Fe XVII with ne t . 1010 s/cm3 . We fitted the Fe K line separately with the temperature kT = 3.5\nkeV and ionization timescale ne t = 109 s/cm3 . The ionization time is uncertain, but it is impossible to fit the Fe K\nemission with a component with ne t > 2\u00d7109 s/cm3 , since\nthen the spectrum would have exhibited much more Fe L\nemission than observed. Given the low ne t it is likely that\nthe Fe K emission is associated with pure Fe, recently\nshocked by the reverse shock.\nThe separate fitting of the Fe K feature allows us to\nmake a crude estimate of the amount of swept up iron\nlayer of the supernova ejecta. Assuming that the pressure\n\nFig. 3. Abundances of the entire remnant and its SW\nregion, obtained in fitting of the EPIC (MOS1 and\nMOS2) spectrum.

The line emission deficit around 1.2 keV\n\nThe EPIC (MOS1,2) models do not fit an excess of emission around 1.2 keV. This feature is also present in the\nEPIC-pn spectra, and is weakly visible in the RGS spectra. Therefore, this excess is likely to be real and not\ncaused by calibration errors or background features. It\nis possible to fit this region of the spectrum, but only if\nwe allow for unrealistic overabundances of either Na (approximately 5 times of Si) or Ni (4 times of iron).\n\n\fKosenko et al.: The X-ray Spectra Of The SNR 0509-67.5\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

So it is likely that the excess is due to incompleteness of the atomic database concerning Fe XVII,\nin particular due to line emission from the n = 4 to n = 2\nlevel. This is corroborated by the fact that the series limit\nof Fe XVII is at 1.26 keV, which also roughly marks the\nend of the emission excess. Some n = 4 \u2192 2 lines are\npresent in the SPEX code, but their emission strengths\nmay be underestimated. This may not be surprising, since\nthe code has been tested primarily on collisional equilibrium sources, whereas in NEI n = 4 \u2192 2 may be enhanced due to non-equilibrium effects, such as inner shell\nionization of Fe XVI.1\n3.2. RGS data\n\nThe high resolution RGS spectra allowed us to evaluate\nthe velocity broadening of the X-ray emission lines and\nmake an independent estimate of the CSM density. Thus,\nfrom the spectrum in energy range of 0.3 \u2212 2.5 keV we\nfind \u03c3v = 4900 \u00b1 420 km/s (which is the preferred value\nsince it is based on the RGS only). This gives us an upper\nlimit on the age of the SNR of t . R/vshock \u2243 540 \u00b1 50 yr\n(assuming vshock = 4/3\u03c3v ).\nThe first column in Table 1 shows the best fit parameters for the joint MOS+RGS analysis. However, we also\nfitted the RGS spectra separately with a single NEI model.\nIn this case the fitted parameters are quite different, in\nparticular the plasma temperature: kT e = 0.75+0.33\n\u22120.09 keV\n+0.25\n10\nand ionization timescale ne t = (1.28\u22120.33) \u00d7 10 s/cm3 .\nThe probable reason is that the RGS is mostly sensitive\nto the energies in 0.5-1 keV, so it misses the contribution from lines that mostly emit at higher temperatures\nand the continuum. In particular the OVII lines around\n0.55 keV/22 \u00c5 has much more statistical weight in the\n1\nWe discussed this issue with Dr. Kaastra, one of the authors\nof the SPEX code, who agrees that this may explain the lack of\na good fit around 1.2 keV.\n\nRGS spectra. The OVII line emission probably has contributions from a lower temperature plasma, that is not\npicked up by the MOS spectra. The discrepancy therefore points to the presence of temperatures gradients in\nthe SNR.\nIdeally, one would like to incorporate those gradients\ninto a more complete model of the X-ray emission from\nSNR 0509-67.5. We made an attempt to obtain such a\nmodel by fitting a joint MOS-RGS model with 3 NEI\ncomponents, one for the low temperature plasma, one for\nthe bulk of the MOS spectrum, and one for the Fe-K line\nemission. However, it turned out to be difficult to come up\nwith a unique, satisfying solutions, given the complexity\nof the parameter space. Moreover, it would still involve\nsome arbitrary choices. For example, it is not clear what\nto do with the abundances; assume one set of abundances\nfor the first two NEI components, but then we do not allow for possible abundance gradients that are also likely\nto be present. So in short, we have reached here the limit\nof what is possible with multiple components. The RGS\ndata, however, do show that the models in Table 1 are incomplete.\nOne of the advantages of the high spectral resolution\nof the RGS is that it is possible to obtain an estimate of\nthe nitrogen abundance. Nitrogen is not an ejecta product\nof Type Ia supernovae, so any nitrogen must come from\nthe shocked CSM. Therefore, the nitrogen abundance, together with the emission measure makes it possible to obtain an alternative estimate of the pre-shock CSM density,\navoiding some of the confusion due to mixture of pure\nmetal, ejecta components.\nThe hydrogen emission measure of the RGS fit is\nof ne nH V = 4 \u00d7 1059 cm\u22123 and emitting volume of\nVX \u2243 1057 cm3 yield [ne nH ]RGS \u2243 400 cm\u22126 . Taking into\naccount best-fit RGS amount of nitrogen XNRGS = 0.01\nand typical LMC abundance XNCSM = 0.4 (both in solar\nunits), we derive for the circumstellar matter [ne nH ]CSM =\n[ne nH ]RGS (XNRGS /XNCSM ) = 10 cm\u22126 . Thus for the shocked\nCSM (LMC abundances) nH = 3 cm\u22123 , which yields\nnCSM = 0.4 \u2212 0.8 cm\u22123 .\n\n\f6\n\nKosenko et al.: The X-ray Spectra Of The SNR 0509-67.5\n\n0.01\n\nCounts/s/\u00c5\n\n0.1\n\nW7 (Nomoto et al. 1984) and some of the 'mildly-mixed\"\ndelayed-detonation models (Woosley et al. 2007).\nFollowing the estimates of the CSM density derived\nfrom the spex spectral fitting, we surround the remnant\nwith uniform medium of \u03c1CSM = 3 \u00d7 10\u221225 g/cm3 .

Numerical models\nTo simulate the evolution of the remnant and to compare it with the observed data, we employed the hydrodynamical code supremna, which is explained in details in Sorokina et al. (2004). The code assumes spherical symmetry, but it incorporates many relevant physical processes, without which it is not possible to accurately predict peculiarities of SNR radiation, such as\ntime-dependent ionization, inner-shell collisional ionization, possible difference in temperatures of electrons and\nions, the influence of radiative losses, the account of\nelectron thermal conduction and nonthermal particles.\nThe calculations of the lines emission was based on\nGaetz & Salpeter (1983) and Mewe et al. (1985). The introduction of inner-shell ionization processes is described\nin Kosenko (2006).\nTo reproduce the observed remnant in numerical simulations we considered various physical conditions of the\nCSM and also different explosion models: deflagration -\n\nFirst, we used a \"basic\" approach, described\nin Sorokina et al. (2004) where electrons and ions\nare being heated partially due to artificial viscosity\nand degree of the electrons heating is controlled by a\nparameter qi , such that Pi = Pi (thermal) + qi Q and\nPe = Pe (thermal) + (1 \u2212 qi )Q, where Pe , Pi - electrons\nand ions pressure, Q - artificial viscosity (is the case\nwhen only collisional energy exchange takes place\nqi = 1 \u2212 me /mi , me , mi \u2013 electron and ion masses). Note\nthat since qi controls the efficiency of electrons heating\n(their temperature may vary theoretically from 10\u22124 T i to\nT i ), this parameter has a strong influence on the X-ray\nspectrum behavior (line fluxes with respect to free-free\ncontinuum).\nIn this framework we have found that the best fit (in\nterms of \u03c72 /d.o. f.) for the observed spectrum gives the\nvalue of qi = 0.99, which yields the typical ratio of\nT e /T i \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 for the case of W7 explosion model.\nWe also considered a library of thermonuclear explosion\nmodels by Woosley et al. (2007). We employed several\nof them with various amounts of iron and intermediate\nmass elements (IME). We have found that the explosion of a \"mildly-mixed\" delayed detonation model with\nE = 1.4\u00d71051 ergs, MNi = 0.5M\u2299 , MFe = 0.4M\u2299 , MIME =\n0.3M\u2299 (c050403m model in Woosley et al. 2007, notation) gives the best-fit to the observed EPIC MOS spectrum of the SNR with qi = 0.9 and thus T e /T i \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nThese values seem to be in reasonable agreement with\nthe relation T e /T i \u221d v\u22122\nS (vS - shock velocity) proposed by Ghavamian et al. (2000). Indeed, assuming for\nthe SNR 0509-67.5 shock front speed of vS \u2243 4/3v \u2243\n6000 km/s, according to Ghavamian et al. (2000, Fig.2)\nwe should expect T e /T i = 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nThe simulated (for these two explosion models) and\nthe observed X-ray spectra are presented in Fig.6. Note\nthat all of our models exhibit noticeable lack of flux in\nthe region of Fe L complex (compared to the observed\nspectrum). This is caused by some incompleteness of the\natomic data set for Fe L emission employed in our package, as verified by directly comparing a single NEI model\nas obtained by the supremna code and in spex. This issue\nwill be addressed in future updates of the supremna code.\nAt higher densities of the CSM, there is no the Fe L\nemission deficit, but in these models the expansion rate of\nthe shell and the radius of the contact discontinuity are in\n\n\fKosenko et al.: The X-ray Spectra Of The SNR 0509-67.5\n400 years\n\n6\n4\n2\n4\n\n3\n\nR\n\nCD\n\n, pc\n\nej\n\nvmax, 1000 km/s\n\n350 years\n\n7\n\n2\n\n\u221224\n\n\u03c1\n\n10\n, g/cm3\n\nCSM\n\n\u221224\n\n\u03c1\n\n10\n, g/cm3\n\nCSM\n\nFig. 5.

So the value of CSM density\nwas chosen to satisfy the observed velocity of the emitting\nejecta, the age and the geometrical size (assuming that the\nobserved edge of the remnant close corresponds to the location of the contact discontinuity) of the remnant for the\nconsidered explosion mechanisms. Figure 5 shows maximum velocity of the shocked ejecta and position of the\ncontact discontinuity depending on the assumed value of\nCSM density for the delayed detonation explosion model\nc050403 at the age of 350 (left panels) and 400 (right panels) years. The figure indicates that for an assumed age of\n400 years, the CSM density of 3 \u00d7 10\u221225 g/cm3 gives\na reasonable compromise between velocity and radius.\nAn assumption that the remnant may be as young as 350\nyears, allows the CSM to be denser than 5 \u00d7 10\u221225 g/cm3 ,\nbut in this case the synthetic X-ray spectra disagree with\nthe observed ones (there are major discrepancies in Fe L\nemission and Si K and S K lines fluxes). More energetic\n(E > 1.4 \u00d7 1051 ) progenitor could shift the allowable values of the density to higher ranges. We checked several\nof them, which contain more 5 6Ni, and which could be\nconsistent with the optical spectrum of the supernova, as\nextracted from the light echo (Rest et al. 2008).

Accounting for the cosmic rays\n\nWe introduced an additional component representing the\npressure and energy from (relativistic) cosmic ray particles, in a way that could be easily implemented within the\ncurrent framework of this code. This was done by altering\n(softening) the equation of state as follows:\n(\n\nP = Pg + 31 \u00e2T 4\nE = Eg + \u00e2T 4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Pg is the gas pressure, Eg is the gas internal energy, T is the \"temperature\" and \u00e2 is a free parameter\nmimicking the contribution of the relativistic particles.\nEffectively it means, that some part of the energy is transferred into relativistic particles, which behave similar to a\nphoton gas.\nDensity profiles for the cases with and without\nthis relativistic correction for the delayed-detonation\nc050403m (Woosley et al. 2007) model are presented\nin Fig.7. Note that in the case of the relativistic alteration\nof the equation of state (gray solid line), the density jump\nat the forward shock is enhanced, compared to the basic\nset up.

Also the\ndistributions of Si (black dash-dotted line) and Fe (gray\ndashed line) in the ejecta are shown.\n\nHowever, in reality the cosmic ray contribution to the\ninternal energy may be different for the forward and reverse shock. Recently, Helder & Vink (2008) established,\nthat in the case of the SNR Cas A, the reverse shock can\naccelerate cosmic ray particles up to energies of a few\nTeV.\nIn this set up, a configuration with the cosmic-ray energy density ECR = \u00e2T 4 of the order of 0.4Eg , produce a\nmodel which also gives a good fit to the observed spectrum. The modeled and observed X-ray spectra for this\napproach are presented in Fig.8.\nChevalier (1983) considered self-similar solutions for\na mixture of a fluid with \u03b3 = 5/3 and a relativistic gas\n(i.e., cosmic rays) with \u03b3 = 4/3. The effective adiabatic index was determined by a constant fraction of cosmic rays in total pressure. Later Blondin & Ellison (2001)\nused a constant value of effective \u03b3 which was taken\nsometimes even lower than 4/3 to allow for a stronger\ncompression ratio mimicking radiative shock waves. We\nnote that our parametrization, being also simple in comparison with a true cosmic rays model, is much richer\nthan used by Chevalier (1983); Blondin & Ellison (2001)\nin their purely hydrodynamic studies.

For\nexample, using the correlation \u03c1CSM v3S \u221d B2 from Vink\n(2006, Fig. 6) one might expect B . 100 \u03bcG.\nThe list of the typical properties of these models is\nalso presented in Table 2. In this case the difference\nbetween electron and ion temperatures is not so drastic: T e /T i \u2243 0.03, which is still in agreement with\nGhavamian et al. (2000), where at \u03b3 = 4/3 (relativistic\nequation of state) the SNR plasma velocities (of \u223c 4500\nkm/s) correspond to T e /T i \u2243 10\u22122 .\n\n5. Discussions and concluding remarks\nThe analysis of the XMM-Newton X-ray spectrum of the\nSNR 0509-67.5 allowed us to estimate basic parameters\nof the object and reveals several peculiar features.\nFirst of all we obtained reasonable and consistent estimates for the CSM density, using various methods: the\nEPIC MOS data fitting gives the estimates of the circumstellar medium density of nCSM . 0.6 cm\u22123 , the\nRGS spectral fitting of nitrogen abundance (which is\nnot a product of thermonuclear explosion) yield nCSM =\n0.4 \u2212 0.8 cm\u22123 .

Moreover the model was unable\nto reproduce the observed Fe K line, so the line was fitted separately. The centroid of Fe K line is located at\n6.50 \u00b1 0.05 keV, so it should be produced by low ionized\n(6 XVII) ions of iron. This could mean that the reverse\nshock of the remnant just recently reached and heated up\nthe iron core of the supernova. The Fe K feature enables\nus to make a crude estimate of the amount of heated iron\nof MFe \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 .\nIn a framework of a NEI model with fixed single\nionization timescale, abundances of the species lighter\nthan aluminum tend to be overestimated, meanwhile, the\namount of heavy species (iron group) tends to be underestimated (Hughes et al. 1998). For example, in the\nW7 model the Mg/Si line flux ratio is higher than observed (Fig.6, Fig.8), while Fig.3 shows that the Mg/Si\nabundance ratio is lower compared to the observed one.\nThe same is true for the iron abundance: Badenes et al.\n(2008); Rest et al. (2008) showed that the remnant has a\nvery large amount of iron, while the abundance of Fe, deduced from this simple fitting is considerably low. Note,\nhowever, that probably most of the Fe has not yet been\nheated by the reverse shock.\nIn this context (using only abundances derived from\nsingle ionization timescale NEI model) it is hard to determine the precise explosion mechanism. If we consider\nonly the species from Si to Ar, then a delayed-detonation\nmodel with MFe = 0.9 M\u2299 and an explosion energy of\n1.4 \u00d7 1051 ergs (Woosley et al. 2007) seems more preferable (Fig.3). The same tendency is confirmed by comparison of the observed spectra and the spectra from numerical simulations, performed in this study. This conclusion\nis in agreement with the results obtained by Badenes et al.\n(2008); Rest et al. (2008).\n\nA separate study of the remnant's bright southwest region shows that this spot appears to be more metal-rich:\nour fitting shows that it is at least twice more abundant in\nmetals than the average metallicity throughout the remnant. This points to either an asymmetric explosion of\nthe SNR or asymmetric CSM. Meanwhile note, that in\nGhavamian et al. (2007) it was mentioned that this region\nhas a blueshifted velocity excess. Which is a hint for an\nasymmetric explosion.\nThe numerical models are in agreement with the overall properties of SNR 0509-67.5 inferred from the studies\npresented in Section 3, which are as following: the CSM\ndensity \u03c1CSM \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u221225 g/cm3 , the age t = 350 \u2212 400\nyears, and the plasma velocities v \u2243 4000 \u2212 5000 km/s.\nThe ratio of electron to ion temperatures of T e /T i \u2243 0.01\nis in satisfactory agreement with the expansion velocity of\nthe remnant (Ghavamian et al. 2000), but heavily depends\non the assumed explosion model (see also Badenes et al.\n2006). Ejecta abundances govern electron population ne\nand thus, the X-ray spectral shape. The latter is used to\nfind the \"best-fit\" value of T e /T i .\nThe low value of T e /T i together with almost undetectable power-law emission point to the yet ineffective\nrole of plasma instabilities and/or magnetic field at this\nstage in this object. Nevertheless, the simulations also indicate that the energy of relativistic particles is probably\nnot negligible and may contribute up to \u223c 40% of thermal\nenergy, so the magnetic field (provided that ECR \u223c B2 /8\u03c0)\nmight be slightly higher, \u223c 500 \u03bcG, than the expected\nvalue of \u223c 100 \u03bcG based on the relation reported by Vink\n(2006), but within reasonable limits.\nWe have found satisfactory hydrodynamical models\nfor the remnant, but many problems still exist.\nIn our synthetic spectra some of the line centroids and\nline fluxes ratios do not perfectly fit the observations. This\nis partly due to limited set of explosion models available\nand to still appreciable number of free parameters (electron temperature, thermal conduction, magnetic fields,\n\n\f10\n\nKosenko et al.: The X-ray Spectra Of The SNR 0509-67.5\n\ncosmic ray particles, and other non-thermal and relativistic effects). For instance, more energetic explosion model\n(E > 1.4 \u00d7 1051 ) could produce a supernova remnant at\nthe age of 350 \u2212 400 years with required high ejecta velocity, observed radius, and more acceptable higher value\nof CSM density (up to 10\u221224 g/cm3 ). Nevertheless such a\nmodel should contain a lot of 56 Ni and small amount of Si\nand S. The X-ray spectra produced by such an explosion\nmodel disagree with the observed one which contains a\nvery well pronounced Si K and S K lines.\nMoreover, one of the shortcomings of the code is that\nfor the calculation of the X-ray emission, and for the reproduction of the observed spectrum around 1 keV, we\nneed to update the atomic data for Fe L code. A task that\nwe plan to undertake in the near future.\nTo create more or less reliable models for supernova\nremnants, further developments of the physics in hydrodynamical simulations are required. Self-consistent treatment of cosmic-rays acceleration is necessary. 3D simulations may shed some light on the influence of various instabilities on the SNR dynamics. Further analysis of high\nresolution X-ray spectra is needed to evaluate the conditions in other SNRs as well.\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to the referee C.
