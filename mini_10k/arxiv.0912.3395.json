Various methods of\ncontrol have been developed since the ground-breaking\nwork of Ott et al. (1990). One scheme where the control\nforce is constructed from time-delayed signals (Pyragas,\n1992) has turned out to be very robust and universal to\napply, and easy to implement experimentally. In this timedelayed feedback control the control signal is built from the\ndifference s(t)\u2212s(t\u2212\u03c4 ) between the present and an earlier\nvalue of an appropriate system variable s. It is noninvasive\nsince the control forces vanish if the target state (a periodic\nstate of period \u03c4 or a steady state) is reached. Thus the\nunstable states themselves of the uncontrolled system are\nnot changed, but only their neighbourhood is adjusted\nsuch that neighbouring trajectories converge to it, i.e., the\ncontrol forces act only if the system deviates from the state\nto be stabilized.\n\nsimplest model which may reveal features of interacting\nneurons consists of two coupled neural oscillators. Each of\nthese will be represented by a simplified FitzHugh-Nagumo\nsystem (FitzHugh, 1961; Nagumo et al., 1962), which is\noften used as a paradigmatic generic model for neurons,\nor more generally, excitable systems (Lindner et al., 2004).\nHere we use two identical FitzHugh-Nagumo systems with\nparameters corresponding to the excitable regime.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 1, we discuss\nthe dynamics of delay-coupled neurons and investigate the\nperiod of oscillations which can be induced for sufficiently\nlarge delay and coupling strength. The additional application of time-delayed self-feedback leads to complex scenarios of synchronized in-phase or antiphase oscillations,\nbursting patterns, or amplitude death. The stabilization\nof steady states in optical systems is studied in Sec. 2 in\nthe framework of a modified Lang-Kobayashi model of a\nsemiconductor laser where the time-delayed feedback is\nrealized by a Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator.\n\nv\u03071 = u1 + a\nu3\n\u000fu\u03072 = u2 \u2212 2 \u2212 v2 + C[u1 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 u2 (t)]\n3\n+K[u2 (t \u2212 \u03c4K ) \u2212 u2 (t)]\n\n1. NEUROSYSTEMS\nIn order to grasp the complicated interaction between\nbillions of neurons in large neural networks, those are often\nlumped into groups of neural populations each of which\ncan be represented as an effective excitable element that\nis mutually coupled to the other elements (Rosenblum and\nPikovsky, 2004; Popovych et al., 2005). In this sense the\n\nWe consider the simultaneous action of delayed coupling\nand delayed self-feedback. Here we choose to apply the\nself-feedback term symmetrically to both activator equations, but other feedback schemes are also possible. The\nequations of the system are given by\nu31\n\u2212 v1 + C[u2 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 u1 (t)]\n3\n+K[u1 (t \u2212 \u03c4K ) \u2212 u1 (t)]\n\n\u000fu\u03071 = u1 \u2212\n\nv\u03072 = u2 + a,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere subsystems Eqs. (1)-(2) and (3)-(4) represent two\ndifferent neurons (or neuron populations), ui (i = 1, 2)\ndescribing the activator (e.g., transmembrane voltages)\nand vi modelling the inhibitor (e.g., electrical conductances of the relevant ion currents across the respective\nmembranes). Here a is a bifurcation parameter whose\nvalue defines whether the system is excitable (a > 1) or\ndemonstrates periodic firing, i.e., autonomous oscillations\n(a < 1), \u000f is positive parameter that is usually chosen to be\nmuch smaller than unity, corresponding to fast activator\nvariables u1 , u2 , and slow inhibitor variables v1 , v2 .\nLet us illustrate the dynamics of a single neuron model by\nconsidering an uncoupled subsystem Eqs. (1) and (2) (C =\n\n\fe.g., due to neurovascular couplings that has a characteristic latency, or due to finite propagation speed along\ncyclic connections within a neuron sub-population, or they\ncould be realized by external feedback loops as part of\na therapeutical measure, as proposed by Popovych et al.\n(2005). This feedback scheme is simple to implement and\nquite robust. One distinct advantage of this method is its\nnoninvasiveness, i.e., in the ideal deterministic limit the\ncontrol force vanishes on the target orbit, which may be a\nsteady state or a periodic oscillation of period \u03c4 . In case of\nnoisy dynamics the control force, of course, does not vanish\nbut still remains small, compared to other common control\ntechniques using external periodic signals, for instance,\nin deep-brain stimulation to suppress neural synchrony in\nParkinson's disease (Tass, 2002).\n\nFig. 1. Panel (a): Phase portrait with nullcline of the single FitzHugh-Nagumo system without time-delayed\nfeedback.

This is realized by\nsmall random fluctations modeled as Gaussian white noise\nD\u03b6(t) with noise intensity D applied to Eq. (2). We fix\nD = 0.02, and also set a = 1.05, \u000f = 0.005. In Fig. 1(a)\nthe dashed blue and solid red curves show the nullclines\nof Eq. (1) and (2), respectively, which intersect at a fixed\npoint. The phase point that is initially placed at the fixed\npoint stays in its close vicinity if the applied random\nperturbation remains small. However, if the perturbation\nis larger than some threshold value, the phase point makes\na large excursion in the phase space before returning to the\nvicinity of the fixed point again. In Fig. 1(a) the black solid\nline illustrates such a phase trajectory and in Fig. 1(b)\nrealizations of u1 and v1 time series from Eqs. (1) and (2)\nare shown. The motion of the phase point consists of two\nstages: an activation time during which the system waits\nfor a sufficiently large perturbation before it can make an\nexcursion, and the excursion itself. The excursion time is\nalmost completely defined by the deterministic properties\nof the system and is hardly influenced by noise.\nThe synaptic coupling between two neurons in Eqs. (1)(4) is modelled as a diffusive coupling considered for\nsimplicity to be symmetric (Liley and Wright, 1994; Pinto\net al., 2000; De-Miguel et al., 2001). More general delayed\ncouplings are considered in (Buric and Todorovic, 2003).\nThe coupling strength C summarizes how information is\ndistributed between neurons. The mutual delay \u03c4 in the\ncoupling is motivated by the propagation delay of action\npotentials between the two neurons u1 and u2 .\nBesides the delayed coupling we also consider delayed\nself-feedback in the form suggested by Pyragas (Pyragas,\n1992), where the difference s(t) \u2212 s(t \u2212 \u03c4K ) of a system\nvariable s, e.g., activator or inhibitor, at time t and at\na delayed time t \u2212 \u03c4K , multiplied by some control amplitude K, is coupled back into the same system. Such\nfeedback loops might arise naturally in neural systems,\n\nBy a linear stability analysis, it can be shown that the\nfixed point remains stable for all values of K and \u03c4K in\ncase of a > 1, as without self-feedback (Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2008).\nRedefining \u03be = 1 \u2212 a2 \u2212 C \u2212 K, one obtains the factorized\ncharacteristic equation\n(5)\n1 \u2212 \u03be\u03bb + \u000f\u03bb2 = \u03bbKe\u2212\u03bb\u03c4K \u00b1 \u03bbCe\u2212\u03bb\u03c4\nSubstituting the Hopf condition \u03bb = i\u03c9 and separating\ninto real and imaginary parts yields for the imaginary part\n\u2212\u03be = K cos(\u03c9\u03c4K ) \u00b1 C cos(\u03c9\u03c4 )\n(6)\nThis equation has no solution for a > 1 since |\u03be| = a2 \u2212\n1 + C + K > C + K.\n\nFig. 2.

The transition between black and\ncolor marks the bifurcation line. Inset (a) shows the\noscillation period vs. \u03c4 in a cut at C = 0.8. Inset\n(b): schematic plot of the saddle-node bifurcation of\na stable (red solid line) and unstable (blue dashed)\nlimit cycle. The maximum oscillation amplitude is\nplotted vs. the delay time \u03c4 and the stable fixed point\nis plotted as a solid black line. The grey background\nmarks the bistable region. Parameters: a = 1.05,\n\u000f = 0.01, K = 0 (Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2008).\nIn Fig. 2 the regime of oscillations is shown in the parameter plane of the coupling strength C and coupling delay\n\u03c4 . The oscillation period is color coded. The boundary of\nthis colored region is given by the minimum coupling delay\n\n\f\u03c4min as a function of C. For large coupling strength, \u03c4min\nis almost independent of C; with decreasing C it sharply\nincreases, and at some small minimum C no oscillations\nexist at all. At the boundary, the oscillation sets in with\nfinite frequency and amplitude as can be seen in the insets\nof Fig. 2 which show a cut of the parameter plane at\nC = 0.8. The oscillation period increases linearly with \u03c4 .\nThe mechanism that generates the oscillation is a saddlenode bifurcation of limit cycles (see inset (b) of Fig. 2),\ncreating a pair of a stable and an unstable limit cycle. The\nunstable limit cycle separates the two attractor basins of\nthe stable limit cycle and the stable fixed point.\n\nFig. 3. Influence of delayed self-feedback upon coupled\noscillations. The mean interspike interval (ISI) is color\ncoded in the control parameter plane of the selffeedback gain K and delay \u03c4K . White areas mark\nregimes of irregular oscillations where the ISI variance\nbecomes large (> 0.01). Time series corresponding to\npoints (a)-(f) are shown in Fig. 4. Other parameters:\na = 1.3, \u000f = 0.01, C = 0.5, \u03c4 = 3 (Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2008).\nThe adopted form of control allows for the synchronization\nof the two cells not only for identical values of \u03c4 and\n\u03c4K , but generates an intricate pattern of synchronization\nislands or stripes in the (\u03c4, \u03c4K ) control parameter plane\n(Fig. 3) corresponding to single-spike in-phase and antiphase oscillations with constant interspike intervals, see\nalso Fig. 4(a)-(d). Further, for adequately chosen parameter sets of coupling and self-feedback control, we observe\neffects such as bursting patterns Fig. 4(f) and oscillator\ndeath Fig. 4(e). In addition to these effects, there exists\na control parameter regime in which the self-feedback has\nno effect on the oscillation periods (shaded yellow).\nFig. 3 shows the control parameter plane for coupling\nparameters of the uncontrolled system in the oscillatory\nregime (C = 0.5 and \u03c4 = 3). We observere three principal\nregimes: (i) Control has no effect on the oscillation period\n(yellow), although the form of the stable limit cycle is\nslightly altered (Fig. 4(a)). (ii) Islands of in-phase and\nantiphase synchronization (color coded, see Fig. 4 (b)(d)).(iii) Oscillator death (black) Fig. 4 (e)).\n2.

In dimensionless form,\nit consists of two differential equations for the slowly\nvarying amplitude (envelope) E(t) of the complex electric\nfield and the reduced carrier density (inversion) n(t).\nHere we consider a modification of the LK equations\nappropriate for multisection semiconductor lasers with an\ninternal passive dispersive reflector (Tronciu et al., 2000).\nThis is modeled by a gain function k(n) depending upon\nthe internal dispersive feedback from the Bragg grating.\nSuch a laser structure allows for more complex dynamic\nbehavior including self-sustained relaxation oscillations\n(intensity pulsations) generated by Hopf bifurcations, as\nhas been shown in the framework of traveling wave laser\nmodels (Bauer et al., 2004; Schikora et al., 2006). We\nare interested in the regime above a supercritical Hopf\nbifurcation where the fixed point in the uncontrolled\nsystem is unstable. Combining the rate equation for the\ncarrier density from Ref. (Tronciu et al., 2000) with the\nrate equation for the complex electric field, we obtain the\nfollowing form of modified LK equations:\ndE T\n= (1 + \u0131\u03b1) nE \u2212 Eb (t),\n(7)\ndt\n2\ndn\n2\n= I \u2212 n \u2212 (1 + n)k(n) |E| ,\n(8)\ndt\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the linewidth enhancement factor, I is the\nreduced excess injection current, T is the time scale ratio\n\n\fof the carrier lifetime \u03c4c and the photon lifetime \u03c4p , and\nEb (t) denotes the feedback term, which will be described\nin detail later.\nThe function k(n), which models the internal dispersive\nfeedback, is chosen as a Lorentzian, as proposed by Tronciu\net al. (2000):\nk(n) = k0 +\n\nAW 2\n2\n\n4 (n \u2212 n0 ) + W 2\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere A denotes the height, W is the width, and n0 is\nthe position of the resonance. The parameter k0 is chosen\nsuch that k(0) = 1 at the laser threshold. Througout the\nfollowing we will use the parameters A = 1, W = 0.02,\nand n0 = \u22120.034.\n\nFig. 5.

K\ndenotes an attenuator, R is related to the mirror\nreflectivity of the external resonator, \u03c4 is the round\ntrip time of the resonator, \u03c6 and \u03b4 are phase shift\nand latency time due to the distance between laser\nand resonator (Dahms et al., 2008).\nIn Eqs. (7), the feedback term Eb (t) has not been specified\nyet. In the following, we introduce the feedback term such\nthat it models a Fabry-Perot resonator. As opposed to the\noriginal LK model where only a single external mirror is\nconsidered, we take an external FP resonator with multiple\nreflections into account:\nEb (t) = \u03ba\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nelectric field can be arbitrarily fixed to \u03c8 = 0 (solitary\nlaser mode).\n\u221a\nUsing p\nthe abbreviations E(t)\n= T [\u03a90 + x(t)\n\u0001\u0003 + \u0131y(t)],\n\u0002\ndk\n\u03a90 = I/T and \u0393 = T \u22121 1 + I 1 + dn\nwith realn=0\nvalued x and y, the fixed point is located at (n = 0, x =\n0, y = 0).

(2000):\n\u03a90 = 0.06, \u03b1 = 5, \u0393 = \u22120.01 (corresponding to T = 500,\nI = 1.8, A = 1, W = 0.02, n0 = \u22120.034, and k0 = 0.993).\nThus the intrinsic period of the uncontrolled unstable\nfocus is T0 \u2248 \u03c0/\u03a90 \u2248 52.\nThe stability of the lasing fixed point is given by Eq. (11).\nWe solved this equation via Newton's method. Since the\ntranscendental equation has an infinite number of roots,\nwe scanned the complex plane as initial conditions of\nthe root-finding algorithm to locate the eigenvalue with\nthe largest real part. The parameter space consisting of\nK, \u03c4 , R, \u03c6, and \u03b4 is five-dimensional for fixed \u0393 and\n\u03a90 . To visualize the domain of control, we consider twodimensional sections of this parameter space.\n\nRm [E(t \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 m\u03c4 ) \u2212 E(t \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 (m + 1)\u03c4 )]\n\nm=0\n\n= \u03ba [E(t \u2212 \u03b4) \u2212 E(t \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03c4 )] + REb (t \u2212 \u03c4 ).\n(10)\n\u03c4 is the delay time (cavity round trip time), R is a memory\nparameter (mirror reflectivity), \u03b4 denotes the latency time\noriginating from a single round trip between the laser and\nthe resonator (see Fig. 5), and \u03ba = Ke\u2212i\u03c6 is the complex\nfeedback gain with amplitude K and the feedback phase\n\u03c6 which results from the associated optical phase shift.\nThroughout this work we use resonant feedback from the\nFP resonator.\nThe latency time \u03b4, i.e., the propagation time between\nthe laser and the FP, is correlated to the phase \u03c6 by the\nrelation \u03c6 = \u03a90 \u03b4, where \u03a90 is the frequency of the emitted\nlight. However, we consider the two parameters \u03c6 and \u03b4 as\nindependent variables because the phase \u03c6 can be tuned by\nsubwavelength changes of the separation between laser and\nFP resonator, on which scale the slowly varying amplitude\nE, which depends upon \u03b4, does not change. The effect of\nlatency in time-delayed feedback was already studied in\na general context in Refs. (Just et al., 1999; H\u00f6vel and\nSocolar, 2003; H\u00f6vel and Sch\u00f6ll, 2005; Dahms et al., 2007).\nTo investigate the stability of the cw laser emission, we\nwill perform a linear stability\n\u221a analysis of the lasing state\nis located at (n = 0, E = Ie\u0131\u03c8 ) where the phase of the\n\nFig. 6. Domain of control according to Eq. (11) in the\n(K, \u03c4 )-plane for different values of \u03c6. The color code\ndenotes the largest real part Re(\u039b) of the eigenvalues\n\u039b; only negative values are plotted. Panels (a), (b),\n(c), and (d) correspond to \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0/16, \u03c0/8, and\n3\u03c0/16, respectively. Other parameters: \u0393 = \u22120.01,\n\u03a90 = 0.06, \u03b1 = 5, R = 0.7, and \u03b4 = 0 (Dahms et al.,\n2008).\nIn Fig. 6, the domain of control is shown in the (K, \u03c4 )plane for different values of the phase: \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0/16, \u03c0/8,\nand 3\u03c0/16 in panels (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. The\ncolor code denotes the largest real part of the eigenvalues\nand is therefore a measure of stability. Note that only\n\n\fvalues of Re(\u039b) < 0 are plotted, thus the shaded regions\ncorrespond to a stable lasing fixed point, i.e., a stable cw\noutput. The control domains form tongues separated by\n(white) regions of no control around \u03c4 = nT0 with n\ninteger, just as in the generic model studied in Refs. (H\u00f6vel\nand Sch\u00f6ll, 2005; Dahms et al., 2007). It can be seen\nthat the domain of control shrinks with increasing phase.\nHere, the domains of control are cut off by boundaries\nfrom the upper left and right for increasing phase, leading\nto overall smaller regions of stability. The tongues of\nstabilization are also slightly distorted towards smaller\nvalues of \u03c4 . Additionally, in this picture, the regions of\noptimum stability, denoted by yellow color, are shifted\ntowards larger values of the feedback gain K.\n\nwhich yields for our parameters \u03c4opt \u2248 26.\n\nFig. 8. Domain of control in the (K, R)-plane for different\nvalues of \u03c6 and fixed optimum time delay \u03c4 = 26. The\ncolor code denotes the largest real part Re(\u039b) of the\neigenvalues \u039b; only negative values are plotted. Panels\n(a), (b), (c), and (d) correspond to \u03c6 = 0, \u03c0/16, \u03c0/8,\nand 3\u03c0/16, respectively. Other parameters as in Fig. 6\n(Dahms et al., 2008).\n\nFig. 7. Domain of control in the (K, \u03c4 )-plane for different\nvalues of \u03b4 and fixed \u03c6 = 0. The color code denotes\nthe largest real part Re(\u039b) of the eigenvalues \u039b; only\nnegative values are plotted. Panels (a), (b), (c), and\n(d) correspond to \u03b4 = 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5, respectively.\nOther parameters as in Fig. 6 (Dahms et al., 2008).\nNext, we will investigate the role of the latency time in\nthe (K, \u03c4 )-plane. In Fig. 7, the domain of control in the\n(K, \u03c4 )-plane is depicted for different values of the latency\ntime, i.e., \u03b4 = 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5, and fixed \u03c6 = 0. For\nlarger latency times, the domains of control shrink and\nit can also be observed that they are bent down towards\nsmaller values of the time delay \u03c4 . Note that the regions\nof optimum stability, denoted by yellow color, are only\nslightly affected by the change of the latency time.\nAll figures shown here were obtained for a fixed value of\nthe memory parameter R = 0.7 as used by Schikora et al.\n(2006). To investigate the dependence of the control on\nR, we display the domains of control in the (K, R)-plane\nfor different values of the phase (\u03c6 = 0, \u03c0/8, \u03c0/4, and\n3\u03c0/8) and fixed time delay \u03c4 = 26 in Fig. 8. This value\nof \u03c4 was chosen based on the results from the generic\nmodel considered by H\u00f6vel and Sch\u00f6ll (2005); Dahms et al.\n(2007), where it was shown that the optimum time delay\nis given by \u03c4 = T0 /2 = \u03c0/Im(\u039b0 ), where \u039b0 denotes the\neigenvalue of the uncontrolled system. In the LK model,\nthe imaginary part of the eigenvalues in the uncontrolled\nsystem\nis given by Eq. (11) with K = 0, i.e., Im(\u039b0 ) =\np\n4\u03a920 \u2212 \u03932 . This leads to an optimum time delay:\n\u03c0\n\u03c4opt = p 2\n,\n(12)\n4\u03a90 \u2212 \u03932\n\nNow, in Fig. 8, it can be seen that the domain of control\nin the (K, R)-plane has maximum size for \u03c6 = 0 for\nthis choice of the time delay \u03c4 . [See panel Fig. 8(a).]\nFor increasing phase, the domain of control shrinks while\nmoving to the upper right. Stability is then only achieved\nin a small region at large values of K and R. [See panels\nFig. 8(b) to (d).]\n\nFig. 9. Domain of control in the (K, \u03c6)-plane for different\nvalues of \u03c4 and fixed \u03b4 = 0. The greyscale (color code)\ndenotes the largest real part Re(\u039b) of the eigenvalues\n\u039b; only negative values are plotted. Panels (a) and\n(b) correspond to \u03c4 = 26 and 5, respectively. Other\nparameters as in Fig. 6 (Dahms et al., 2008).\nTo investigate the dependence of the domain of control\non the choice of the phase \u03c6 further, we consider another\ntwo-dimensional projection of the five-dimensional controlparameter space parameterized by feedback gain K and\nthe feedback phase \u03c6. This section is depicted in Fig. 9\nfor two different values of the time delay and fixed \u03b4 = 0.\nIn panel (a), the time delay is chosen as 26, which is the\noptimum \u03c4 according to Eq. (12). Here, it can be seen that\nthe optimum phase is located at slightly negative values\nfor small values of the feedback gain up to K \u2248 0.05.\nIncreasing K, the optimum phase changes its sign and is\nnow located at small positive values of \u03c6. For the case\nof \u03c4 = 5, which is depicted in panel (b), stability is\n\n\foverall enhanced drastically. The yellow areas, denoting\nregions of optimum stability, are located at negative \u03c6\nfor small K up to K \u2248 0.1. Control is possible even for\na small value of \u03c6 below \u2212\u03c0/2, if the feedback gain is\ntuned exactly to the small range of K \u2248 0.01. For larger\nfeedback gain with K > 0.1, the optimum value of \u03c6 is\nlocated at positive values. The region of optimum stability\nis located at large values of K around 0.2. The shape of\nthe control domain in Fig. 9 is markedly different from\nthat in the generic normal form model (see Figs. 6(c) and\n7(c) in Ref. (Dahms et al., 2007)), but appears to be in\nline with full device simulations within a travelling wave\nmodel (W\u00fcnsche et al., 2008).\nTo summarize, we have focused on simple rate equation\nmodels of neural systems and lasers, which contain a time\ndelay. In these systems, analytical results are important to\ncomplement computer simulations to determine whether\nthese systems fall into categories defined by the nature\nof their bifurcations. This way, we have gained a more\ngeneral understanding of the principles of dynamical patterns and their control. Delay dynamics can, on one hand,\nadd to the dynamic complexity and generate bifurcations,\nand, on the other hand, stabilize unstable states and\nsuppress complex dynamics. Even in the most generic\nneural systems described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, when coupled in a minimum network of two nodes\nwith delayed coupling and delayed self-feedback, we found\ncomplex scenarios of synchronized neuronal dynamics with\nin-phase or antiphase oscillations, bursting patterns, and\namplitude death. In the case of the multisection semiconductor laser with an internal passive dispersive reflector\nand external optical feedback described by the modified\nLang-Kobayashi model, we found that time-delayed selffeedback can stabilize the laser. In the regime above a\nsupercritical Hopf bifurcation, where the fixed point in\nthe uncontrolled system is unstable, unwanted intensity\npulsations can be suppressed by time-delayed feedback\ncontrol.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supaported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in the framework of Sfb 555.\nREFERENCES\nBauer, S., Brox, O., Kreissl, J., Sartorius, B., Radziunas,\nM., Sieber, J., W\u00fcnsche, H.J., and Henneberger, F.\n(2004).
