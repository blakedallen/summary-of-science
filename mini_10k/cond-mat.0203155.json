Monthus and H. Orland, Europhys. Lett. 55,\n132(2001)\"\n\nSomendra M. Bhattacharjee\nInstitute of Physics, Bhubaneswar 751 005, India;\nemail:somen@iopb.res.in\nGarel, Monthus and Orland[1] (to be referred to as GMO) in a study of\nDNA denaturation transition argued that the effect of mutual repulsion of\nthe two strands can be approximated by a long range interaction. Such a\nreplacement is unjustified and can lead to disastrous consequences.\nThe dimensionless Hamiltonian is\nH =\n\n2 Z\nX\n\n0\n\ni\n\nHev = u0\n\u2248\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\nds\n2\n\nN\n\nZ\n\n\u2202ri (s)\n\u2202s\n\n!2\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nN\n\nds V (r12 (s)) + Hev ,\n\n(1)\n\nN\n\n0\n\nN\n\nds\n\nds ds\u2032 \u03b4\u039b (r1 (s) \u2212 r2 (s\u2032 ))\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1d\n,\n| r12 (s) |d\u22122\n\n(3)\n\n(by GMO)\n\nwhere ri (s) is the d-dimensional position coordinate of a monomer point\nat a contour length s of chain i, each of length N, V is the base pairing\ninteraction at the same contour length (\"directed polymer\" interaction), Hev\nis the mutual excluded volume (ev) interaction represented by the u0 > 0\nterm with \u03b4\u039b (r) as the usual delta function with an ultraviolet cut-off \u039b in\nthe reciprocal space. The thermodynamic properties come from the partition\nR\nfunction Z = DRe\u2212H , where the integration is over the configurations of\nthe polymers. Eq. 3 is the replacement advocated by GMO, obtained by a\npartial sum over the polymer configurations given by the first term on the\nright hand side of Eq. 1. The base-pairing interaction V (r) has just been\nadded on to this effective repulsion in Eq. 16 of Ref. 1.\nIt is well-recognized that the self- and mutually avoiding chains can be\ndescribed by the prevalent renormalization group approach which predicts\nthat in the large length scale limit the chains are described[2] by the stable\nfixed point u\u2217 \u223c \u01eb \u2261 4 \u2212 d, where u is an appropriate running dimensionless\nvariable. From a dimensional analysis point of view, [u0 ] = [\u03b1d ] = Ld\u22124\nwhere L is a length scale but there is a major difference between the two\n1\n\n\fterms in the renormalization group (RG) framework[3, 4, 5]. While the u0\nterm flows under renormalization, thereby reaching a fixed point (fp) for\n\u01eb > 0, i.e., d < 4, the singular \u03b1d term does not get renormalized because\nof the analyticity of the RG transformation[3]. This tells us that for \u01eb \u2192 0\nthe renormalized dimensionless mutual avoidance, u, goes to zero (chains\nbehave like noninteracting random walkers up to log-corrections) but, on the\ncontrary, \u03b14 does not vanish. In technical terms, \u03b14 remains marginal while u\nis a marginally irrelevant variable at d = 4. In fact \u03b14 leads to continuously\nvarying exponents as GMO also rediscovered (see Eq. 33 of Ref. 1). For\n\u01eb > 0, u reaches a f.p. but \u03b1 does not. Therefore, Eq. 3, the replacement\nproposed by GMO, leads to a major contradiction, if we do not want to discard\nRG.\nLastly, the effects of long-range interactions for directed polymers, as done\nin Ref. [1] are already available in Refs. [3, 4, 5].\nI thank ICTP for hospitality.\n\nReferences\n[1] T. Garel, C. Monthus and H. Orland, Europhys. Lett. 55, 132 (2001).\ncond-mat/0101058\n[2] J. F.
