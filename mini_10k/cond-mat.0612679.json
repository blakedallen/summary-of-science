A fundamental question is when, and\nwhether, collective motion becomes important for understanding the macroscopic state of\nthe system [1]. This is a particularly complex issue for granular flows, where the material\nstructure remains amorphous on all scales. While a noticeable structural change would surely\nhelp pinpoint degrees of freedom that govern collective dynamics, granular flows require us\nto use the dynamics to search for structure.\nA central tool in this process is numerical simulation, and new insights from simulations\ncan provide important clues for theory. In the companion paper [2] we have presented\nevidence for a growing length scale related to correlations between grain forces. These\ncorrelations arise from force chain networks that span the space between grains and transmit\nforces elastically. The emergence of force networks alters the mechanisms of momentum\ntransfer, and contact force statistics depend on the size \u03be of force networks.\nSince contact forces are sensitive to the value of \u03be, the derivation of constitutive relations\nto describe the stress tensor must also be based on properties of the networks. While network\nproperties have been incorporated into previous studies of static granular packings [3, 4, 5,\n6, 7, 8, 9], the importance of force networks in the inertial regime has not been adequately\ntaken into account. Instead, constitutive relations are generally obtained using comparisons\nwith liquids [10, 11] and especially kinetic theory [12, 13, 14], which can be extended to treat\ndense materials [15, 16, 17] as long as correlations beyond nearest neighbors are absent.\nIn this paper we examine two models for constitutive relations in granular flow: kinetic\ntheory and a new model, referred to as the force network model. Kinetic theory is rooted in\nthe dilute limit and assumes no long range correlations between grains. The force network\nmodel is motivated by our simulations and attempts to capture the effects of finite sized\nforce networks in a mean-field framework, which spans system behavior from dilute to dense\nregimes.\nThe predictions of these models are compared using measurements of the stress tensor\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 , which is given by\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 V =\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nmi (v\u03b1i \u2212 u\u03b1 )(v\u03b2i \u2212 u\u03b2 ) +\n2\n\nc\nX\n\n{i,j}=1\n\nij\n\u03c3 ij\n\u03b1 F\u03b2 .\n\n(1)\n\n\fIn this equation, Greek subscripts denote components, Roman superscripts denote grains,\nand V represents the volume. The first term quantifies stress resulting from fluctuating\nvelocities, which is related to the mass of each grain mi and the difference between grain\nvelocity vi and average velocity u (where bold face symbols denote full, three component\nvectors). The second term arises from contacts between grains: it depends on the contact\nforces Fij and the distance between contacting grains \u03c3 ij . The sum is taken over all contacts\n{i, j} in the system.\nWe focus on the second term, called the static stress, since it is directly associated with\ncontact forces, and we specialize to non-frictional systems where \u03c3 ij \u00d7 Fij = 0. This allows\nus to write the static stress tensor \u03a3s\u03b1\u03b2 as\n\u03a3s\u03b1\u03b2 V =\n\nc\nX\n\n\u03c3\u0302\u03b1ij \u03c3\u0302\u03b2ij \u03c3 ij F ij ,\n\n(2)\n\n{i,j}=1\n\nwhere \u03c3 ij = \u03c3 ij \u03c3\u0302 ij and F ij is the magnitude of the contact force between pairs {i, j} of\ncontacting grains.\nWe begin in Section II with an investigation of dilute inertial flows and test the predictions\nof hard-sphere kinetic theory. In Section III we focus on dense inertial flows and introduce\nthe force network model.\n\nII.\n\nDILUTE INERTIAL FLOWS\n\nOver the past twenty five years [18, 19] the kinetic theory of dense gases has been generalized to include granular flows, where thermal fluctuations are absent and energy is dissipated\nat each contact. The dissipation mechanism most often considered is instantaneous collisions\nwith constant restitution coefficient\u2013 this is called hard-sphere kinetic theory [20] . In order\nto make progress using hard-sphere kinetic theory, it is necessary to begin by postulating that\nonly binary collisions occur between grains. Without this assumption, calculations quickly\nbecome intractable since high order correlations must be included in kinetic integrals.\nThe principal microscopic input to hard-sphere kinetic theory is the collision rule between\ngrains. This relates the initial velocities of two interacting grains {v\u2032 i , v\u2032 j } to their final\n\nvelocities {vi , vj }:\n\nj\n\ni\n\n(vj \u2212 vi ) * \u03c3\u0302 ij = \u2212e(v\u2032 \u2212 v\u2032 ) * \u03c3\u0302 ij .\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe normal coefficient of restitution e that appears in this equation determines the energy\ndissipated in each collision: for e = 1 the system is elastic and no energy is dissipated; as e\nis reduced to zero the energy dissipation scales as 1 \u2212 e2 .\nKinetic theory relies on the assumption that only binary collision are relevant and is\ntherefore expected to break down as the density of the flow increases and long-lasting contacts arise [21, 22, 23, 24]. Quantitative bounds over which the binary collision assumption\nholds have only recently been estimated [25, 26]. The Contact Dynamics (CD) algorithm\nused here to simulate granular flows is well suited for testing the relevance of the binary\ncollision assumption and bounding the dilute regime. Like hard-sphere kinetic theory, the\nCD algorithm employs a normal coefficient of restitution. However the CD algorithm does\nnot assume a priori that only binary collisions occur.\nOn the contrary, we observe that multi-grain contacts are the dominant interaction in\ndense flows. This is evident in force correlation measurements [2], which identify a growing\ncorrelation length \u03be. This length scale should be an indicator of the breakdown of the binary\ncollision assumption since it implies that grain forces are correlated over large distances and\ndo not simply depend on nearest neighbors. To see how this comes about, it is useful to\nmeasure the static stress tensor.\nEquation (2) gives the microscopic expression for the static stress tensor, which depends\non contact forces between grains. In the case that only binary collisions are considered, as\nin kinetic theory, the value of the static stress tensor is determined by inserting the binary\ncollisional force into Equation (2). The collisional force is the force that occurs between a\npair of colliding grains that are not part of a force network. Given the initial velocities v\u2032 i\nof grains i, the collisional force between two grains is given by\ni\nh\nj\ni\nij\nFbc\n= (1 + e)\u03bcij (v\u2032 \u2212 v\u2032 ) * \u03c3\u0302 ij /dt,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere e is the normal restitution coefficient, \u03bc = mi mj /(mi + mj ) is the reduced mass, and\n\u03c3\u0302 ij is the unit vector connecting the centers of grains i and j. This expression is equal\nto the change of momentum of grains i and j, per simulation time step dt, due to binary\ninteractions. Since all of the parameters can be measured in simulations, the collisional\nforce is a useful probe of the dynamics and was used in the companion paper to exhibit the\npresence of force networks.\n\n4\n\n\fInserting the collisional force into Equation (2) yields the \"collisional\" stress tensor\n\u03a3bc\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n=\n\nc\nX\n\nij\n\u03c3\u0302\u03b1ij \u03c3\u0302\u03b2ij \u03c3 ij Fbc\n,\n\n(5)\n\n{i,j}=0\n\nwhich is the stress tensor that all hard-sphere kinetic theories attempt to model [26]. This\nis because only binary collisions between grains are considered and contact forces can be no\nlarger than the value given in Equation (4).\nIf relevant interactions occur only via binary collisions, the collisional stress in Equation (5) and the static stress in Equation (2) are identical. However, a discrepancy between\nthe collisional and static stress tensors indicates that momentum transfer is not carried\nout by binary collisions alone. Comparing the static and collisional stress tensors in Equations (2) and (5) therefore provides an opportunity to test the binary collision assumption\nand thereby determine when kinetic theory can be applied to hard-sphere granular flows.\nIn Figures 1 and 2 we plot measurements of the static and collisional stress tensor, for a\nwide range of restitution coefficients and packing fractions, in terms of the pressure p and\nshear stress s, which are related to the stress tensors by\n1\n1\nbc\n{ps , pbc } = { (\u03a3s11 + \u03a3s22 ), (\u03a3bc\n11 + \u03a322 )},\n2\n2\ns\nbc\n{ss , sbc } = {\u03a3s12 , \u03a3bc\n}\n=\n{\u03a3\n12\n21 , \u03a321 }.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nIn Figures 1 and 2 both the collisional and static values of the pressure and shear stress\nare normalized by common factors that are explained later, in the paragraph beneath Equation (14). For now, it is only important to note that there is a regime where the binary\ncollision assumption holds and the normalized stress tensors are equal. The bounds of this\nregime depend on the value of both the restitution coefficient and the packing fraction. The\ndata supports a conclusion that the dilute regime is approached as density is reduced or\nrestitution is increased.\nInstead of characterizing the dilute regime in terms of restitution and packing, it is useful\nto relate it to the length scale \u03be. In Figures 1 and 2 we have colored the data points where\n\u03be/\u03beel > 1.25. For all of our data, this simple condition on \u03be nicely characterizes the dilute\nregime\u2013 if \u03be/\u03beel < 1.25 then the static stress tensor is approximately equal to the collisional\nstress tensor and the predictions of kinetic theory apply; if \u03be/\u03beel > 1.25 then interactions\nbetween networks of grains become important and kinetic theory does not apply. The\n5\n\n\fcrossover value of \u03be/\u03beel = 1.25 is also where the contact force distribution P (f ) loses its\npeak [2]. This provides further evidence that \u03be/\u03beel = 1.25 is a good quantitative bound for\nthe dilute regime.\nIn the dilute regime where \u03be/\u03beel < 1.25 and \u03a3s\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03a3bc\n\u03b1\u03b2 , we can test the predictions\nof hard-sphere kinetic theory for both the pressure and shear stress. These predictions\nhave been obtained recently [15, 16, 17] using the Chapman-Enskog expansion to solve\nthe Enskog equation. The Enskog equation determines the time dependence of the oneparticle probability distribution function (pdf) in terms of collision events between grains.\nCollision events consist of binary interactions and the time dependence of the one-particle\npdf can therefore be expressed in terms of just the two-particle pdf. For hard-sphere granular\nmaterials, Enskog's equation reads\n(\u2202t + v1 * \u22071 )f (1) (r1 , v1 , t) = JE [r1 , v1 ],\n\n(8)\n\nwith JE given by\nJE [r1 , v1 ] = \u03c3\n\nZ\n\ndv2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3\u0302\u0398(\u03c3\u0302 * g)(\u03c3\u0302 * g)\n\n(9)\n\n\u00d7[e\u22122 f (2) (r1 , r1 \u2212 \u03c3, v1\u2032 , v2\u2032 , t)\n\u2212f (2) (r1 , r1 + \u03c3, v1 , v2 , t)].\nPhysically, the time dependence of the one-particle pdf f (1) is related to a collisional term JE\nthat quantifies the probability to gain and lose contributions at a certain velocity v1 . The\nfirst term in JE gives the probability that a binary collision between grains results in a grain\nhaving velocity v1 , and the second term gives the probability that a binary collision occurs\ninvolving a grain that has velocity v1 , thereby reducing f (1) (v1 ). The binary collisions occur\naccording to Equation (3) and primed velocities represent pre-collisional values. \u0398 is the\nstep function and g = v1 \u2212 v2 .

The function \u03c7 is interpreted as the equilibrium correlation function at contact and\ndepends on the local value of the density.\nOnce the Enskog equation has been expressed in terms of only the one-particle pdf, it\ncan be solved using the Chapman-Enskog expansion [28, 29], which expands f (1) and JE\nin gradients of the mass density, momentum density, and energy density. This process has\nbeen carried out for granular shear flows to first order in the gradients in Refs.

The normalizing factors are given by p0 = nmT /2 and \u03b70 = m/\u03c3 T /2\u03c0,\n\nwhere m is the grain mass, \u03c3 the grain diameter, T the granular temperature, and n the\nnumber density. We measure all the variables of Equations (12) and (13) in simulations and\ntest the predictions of hard-sphere kinetic theory without fitting parameters. We use the\naverage value of grain mass and diameter for m and \u03c3, and determine \u03c7 by tracking the\nnumber of collisions that occur per second (which we denote by \u03c9) in equilibrium simulations\n\u221a\nwhere e = 1 and \u03b3\u0307 = 0 . Enskog theory relates \u03c7 to \u03c9 through the equation \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03b4T \u03c7n\u03c3.\nThis method for measuring \u03c7 has been used in other recent studies [30].\nWe plot the normalized predictions from Equations (12-14) in Figures 1 and 2, where\nthey are compared to data for the stress tensor. Since hard-sphere kinetic theory assumes\nbinary collisions, the predictions only apply to the dilute regime where \u03be/\u03beel < 1.25. These\nare the open symbols in Figures 1 and 2. We immediately notice that the prediction for the\npressure matches the measured pressure in all of the dilute systems we have investigated.\nConsidering that there are no adjustable parameters, this is a tremendous success for kinetic\ntheory.\n9\n\n\fThe prediction for the shear stress matches the data in the dilute regime only for large\nrestitution. As the restitution becomes smaller, the prediction for the shear stress begins\nto overestimate its measured value. This overestimation is due to pre-collisional velocity\ncorrelations, a mechanism that has been investigated in previous studies [31]. Since Equation (11) assumes no pre-collisional velocity correlations, if these correlations exist then the\naverage momentum transferred in each collision changes. If the pre-collisional normal velocities of two grains tend to be aligned (anti-aligned) then the average momentum transferred\ndecreases (increases), causing the kinetic theory prediction to overestimate (underestimate)\nthe measured values.\nIn the insets of Figures 1 and 2, we plot measurements of the pre-collisional velocity\ncorrelations Cv defined as\ni\n\nj\n\nCv = h(v\u2032 * \u03c3\u0302 ij )(v\u2032 * \u03c3\u0302 ij )i/T,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich are normalized by the granular temperature. This definition yields a positive value\nwhen pre-collisional grain velocities tend to be aligned, and for all restitution coefficients\nwe observe that the correlations are positive. In addition, the magnitude of the discrepancy\nbetween measured and predicted shear stress is roughly proportional to the size of the\nvelocity correlations. These observations support the conclusion that the errors in the kinetic\ntheory prediction are due to pre-collisional velocity correlations.\nTo summarize, the stress tensor predicted by hard-sphere kinetic theory matches data\nfrom our simulations in the dilute regime where \u03be/\u03beel < 1.25 and at high restitution coefficients. As the restitution coefficient is decreased in dilute flows, the prediction for the shear\nstress begins to fail due to the \"molecular chaos\" assumption of Equation (11). Additionally,\nas \u03be/\u03beel becomes larger than 1.25 in the dense regime, the hard-sphere kinetic theory predictions are inaccurate since the binary collision assumption is not valid. These observations\nindicate that the fundamental assumptions of molecular chaos and binary interaction do not\nalways apply, and must be addressed.\nRecent research [20, 32] has concentrated on refining the molecular chaos assumption\nto account for velocity correlations in the dilute regime, which have been measured extensively [31, 33, 34, 35, 36]. However in the dense regime, where networks of interacting\ngrains become important, even an exact inclusion of velocity correlations will not accurately\ndescribe the physics since the binary collision assumption does not apply.\n\n10\n\n\fIII.\n\nDENSE INERTIAL FLOWS\n\nDense inertial flows are not quasi-static and cannot be modeled by assuming binary\ninteractions between grains. They span the range of densities between the dilute and quasistatic regimes, and exhibit properties of both limits. Like dilute flows, dense inertial flows\nare characterized by a Bagnold rheology where the stress tensor is proportional to the square\nof the shear rate [37, 38, 39]. However, as in quasi-static flows, the value of the stress tensor\nalso depends on the properties of force chain networks. In fact, the size of the networks is\na parameter that is relevant in all regimes of granular flow. It varies continuously from the\ndilute regime, where interactions are binary and the network size is unity, to the quasi-static\nregime where force chain networks extend over the entire system. Since the behavior of\ngranular flows can be nicely characterized in terms of the network size, we focus here on\nthe role of force chain networks in determining the value of the stress tensor and construct\na force network model of momentum transport in granular materials. The basic idea is\nthat forces are transferred elastically through finite sized contact networks and the value of\nthe contact force between any pair of grains depends on both the relative velocity of the\ncontacting pair (a \"collisional\" contribution) and the values of the other contact forces in\nthe network, even those a long distance away (an \"elastic\" contribution). This leads to a\nprediction for the stress tensor that holds over the entire inertial regime and incorporates\nthe non-collisional stress that arises when force networks have formed.\n\nA.\n\nThe Force Network Model\n\nA central feature of dense granular materials is that forces can be transferred over distances much larger than the grain size. This is especially evident in static packings of grains,\nbut is also important when considering dense inertial flows. The only necessary requirement\nfor force propagation is the existence of connected networks of interacting grains. When\nthis requirement is met, elastic waves propagate through the networks at a speed set by the\nvalues of the moduli and there is an elastic component of the stress tensor. This elastic\ncontribution must be added to the collisional part of the stress in Equation (5). Therefore\nthe full static stress tensor is comprised of two terms: one describing the elastic response\nand one describing the collisional response.\n\n11\n\n\fFrom a microscopic viewpoint, the value of the stress tensor is determined by contact\nforces between grains, as in Equation (2). Therefore, in the presence of force networks,\nthese contact forces must also be comprised of collisional and elastic terms. The collisional\nterm is given by Equation (4) and represents the local force due to collisions between pairs\nof grains. It depends only on properties of the two contacting grains. The elastic term is a\nresult of elastic deformations in the contact network. It is a non-local force that arises from\nthe network applying an effective pressure on every pair of contacting grains.\nIn dilute flows only the collisional part of contact forces is non-zero and the stress tensor\nis well described by kinetic theory. In the quasi-static regime the elastic part of the forces\nis much larger than the collisional part, and the latter is usually disregarded. In dense\ninertial flows, both terms contribute. The force network model extends hard-sphere kinetic\ntheory by explicitly calculating the effects of elastic waves in force networks. This leads to\na prediction for the elastic portion of contact forces, which result from forces propagating\nthrough force networks at the elastic wave speed. Inertial flows correspond to the limit where\nforces propagate throughout the entire network before it is destroyed. This is equivalent to\nthe limit where the elastic wave speed is infinite, or the grains are perfectly rigid.\nMathematically, the contact force F ij between grains i and j is equal to the sum of a\ncollisional term, plus elastic effects from the network:\nij\nF ij = Fbc\n+\n\nlX\nmax\nl=1\n\nFlij .\n\n(16)\n\nIn this equation the first term is the collisional force, defined in Equation (4), and the\nsecond term arises from forces that propagate through paths in the force chain network, as\nillustrated in Figure 3. We split this term into contributions Flij that represent added forces\nfrom different path-lengths l. The total elastic force created by the network is therefore\nequal to the sum of the contributions Flij over all possible path-lengths l < lmax in the force\nnetwork.\nFigure 3 illustrates force propagation and defines the notion of path-length. For example,\nbecause grain d is in contact with grain e, this increases the force between grains e and f ,\nwhich increases the force between grains f and i, which has the net effect of increasing the\ncontact force between grains i and j. We denote this as a path of length three (l = 3) since\nde\nthe local force Fbc\nmust propagate through three links to influence the contact between i\n\nand j.\n12\n\n\fFIG. 3: A network of contacting grains. The contact force between the shaded grains i and j\nij\nis determined by the local collisional force Fbc\n, plus elastic contributions from forces propagating\n\nthrough the network. It is convenient to organize these non-local effects into contributions from\ndifferent path-lengths. On the top left is a path of size three where the local contact force between\ngrains d and e is transferred through the network to grain i. On the top right is a path of size two,\nand on the bottom right is a path of size one.\n\nThe net effect of forces propagating through different path-lengths can be calculated\nexplicitly in the limit of large elastic wave speeds. We begin by considering a path of length\nl = 1, as illustrated in Figure 3: because grain a is in contact with grain j, the local contact\naj\naj\nforce Fbc\nincreases the value of F ij by an amount equal to Fbc\nmultiplied by the cosine of\n\nthe angle between the unit vectors connecting contacts {a, j} and {i, j}. If we assume that\ngrain i has zi contacts labeled by m and grain j has zj contacts labeled by n, then the effect\nof all paths of length one is to increase F ij in Equation (16) by an amount\nF1ij\n\n=\n\nzi\nX\n\nm=1;m6=j\n\n\u03c3\u0302\n\nmi\n\n* \u03c3\u0302\n\nij\n\nmi\nFbc\n\n+\n\nzj\nX\n\nn=1;n6=i\n\nnj\n\u03c3\u0302 nj * \u03c3\u0302 ij Fbc\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302 ab is the unit vector connecting the center of grains a and b. This expression includes\nall of the effects from paths of length l = 1 on each of the contacting grains i and j.\nIn an analogous manner, the path from grain b to c to j in Figure 3 comprises a path of\nlength two (l = 2), which increases the value of F ij due to the local force between b and c.\nNote that we ignore the fact that the local force between c and j also increases F ij , since\nthis contribution was already included in Equation (17). The total additional force between\n\n13\n\n\fgrains i and j arising from paths of length two is given by\nzi\nzm\nX\nX\nij\npm\nmi\nij\nF2 =\n\u03c3\u0302 pm * \u03c3\u0302 mi Fbc\n\u03c3\u0302 * \u03c3\u0302\np=1;p6=m\n\nm=1;m6=j\nzj\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u03c3\u0302\n\nnj\n\nn=1;n6=i\n\n* \u03c3\u0302\n\nij\n\nzn\nX\n\nq=1;q6=n\n\nqn\n\u03c3\u0302 qn * \u03c3\u0302 nj Fbc\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere once again grain i has zi contacts labeled by m and grain j has zj contacts labeled by\nn. To calculate the effect of paths of length two, we also take into account the zm contacts\nof grain m, labeled by p, and the zn contacts of grain n, labeled by q.\nThe contributions to F ij from arbitrary path-lengths l can be determined by continuing\nthe above arguments. They depend on the coordination number z and are also sensitive to\nthe geometric arrangement of force networks. One important constraint arises as z becomes\nlarge, which is a result of energy conservation. If we consider the total energy T ij that an\narbitrary pair of contacting grains i and j contribute to the network, this must always be\nless than or equal to the total kinetic energy initially stored in the contact (via the kinetic\nenergies of grains i and j). This is because, while energy is conserved in this process, some\nis transferred to the elastic energy of the network and some remains as kinetic energy of\nij\ngrains i and j. The average collisional force hFbc\ni is proportional to the square of the relative\n\nvelocities [15] and thereby proportional to the kinetic energy of the contact. Therefore, on\naverage, the magnitude of the collisional force transferred to nearest neighbors must not be\nij\ngreater than hFbc\ni. This leads to the constraint equation\n\nT\n\nij\n\n\u2261\n\nD\n\nij\nFbc\n\nij\n\u2264 hFbc\ni,\n\nzi\nX\n\n\u03c3\u0302\n\nmi\n\nm=1;m6=j\n\nij\n\n* \u03c3\u0302 +\n\nzj\nX\n\nn=1;n6=i\n\n\u03c3\u0302\n\nnj\n\n* \u03c3\u0302\n\nij\n\n\u0001E\n\n(19)\n\nwhich is a global constraint. It ensures that the total energy supplied to the network never\nexceeds the initial kinetic energy as the elastic waves move from first nearest neighbors, to\nsecond nearest neighbors, and so on.\nEquations (17-19) model the physical origin of elastic forces that exist in dense granular\nmaterials and allow for a complete determination of Flij . The numerical value of the elastic\nforce between a pair of contacting grains is calculated by summing these contributions over\nall possible path-lengths l, as in Equation (16).\nThe maximum possible path length lmax is constrained by the size of the force networks.\nA straight chain of grains that spans the network has l\u2217 = \u03be/\u03beel \u2212 1. While there are also\n14\n\n\fnetwork spanning chains with l > l\u2217 , their contributions to elastic forces are diminished\nsince the magnitude of the collisional force at the end of the chain is reduced by the product\nof the cosine of the angles in the chain. We will therefore set lmax = \u03be/\u03beel \u2212 1 and only\nconsider the network spanning chains that give the largest contribution. This amounts to\ncompletely ignoring the effects of path lengths with l > lmax which increase the elastic force\nP\nij\non the contact {i, j} by an amount \u2206 = \u221e\nl=lmax +1 Fl . We do not expect this approximation\n\nto produce a large error in the total elastic force on {i, j} since \u2206 < Flijmax and, in general,\n\nij\nFl+1\n\u226a Flij for l < lmax .\n\nGiven the above analysis, it is possible to completely determine the stress tensor based\non properties of the force network and the collisional stresses. This is carried out in Subsection III B and the predictions are tested in Subsection III C.\n\nB.\n\nCalculating the stress tensor\n\nWe calculate the stress tensor by rewriting the equations of the force network model in\nterms of integrals instead of sums. Here we carry out this substitution for a two-dimensional\nsystem, although it can be generalized to higher dimensions. If we consider the average force\nbetween two grains that contact at an angle \u03b8, denoted F (\u03b8), then Equation (16) can be\ngeneralized to read\n\u03be/\u03beel \u22121\n\nF (\u03b8) = Fbc (\u03b8) +\n\nX\nl=1\n\nFl (\u03b8).\n\n(20)\n\nThis equates the average force between grains contacting at angle \u03b8 to the average collisional\nforce at that angle, plus elastic effects from the network. In what follows we will measure\n\u03b8 with respect to the axis of shear, so that \u03b8 = 0 corresponds to the axis where there is no\ngradient in grain velocities.\nGeneralizing Equations (17) and (18) to arbitrary path-length l gives\nFl (\u03b80 ) =\n\u00d7\n\nl Z\nY\ni=1\n\n\u03b8i\u22121 +2\u03c0/3\n\u03b8i\u22121 \u22122\u03c0/3\n\n\u0010X\n\nz(\u03b8i )\n\nd\u03b8i cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 )C(\u03b8i )Fbc (\u03b8l )\n\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\np z(\u03b8i ) z(\u03b8i ) \u2212 1 Pz(\u03b8i ) (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ) .\n\n(21)\n\nIn this equation, the sums from the Equations (17) and (18) have been replaced by integrals\nover \u03b8i , which is the angular orientation of each link in the chain. Each integral contains\n15\n\n\fa cosine that replaces the dot product. Note that the bounds of the integrals are arranged\nsuch that the grain at link i is not permitted to overlap the grain at link i \u2212 1. The function\nFbc (\u03b8l ) provides the collisional force at the end of the path. In order to properly characterize\nthe probability to have a contact at \u03b8i , we also introduce the functions z(\u03b8), C(\u03b8) and Pz(\u03b8) .\nC(\u03b8) gives the probability to have a single contact at angle \u03b8 [40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. In the\ncase that there are two (or more) contacts on a single grain, which is necessary to form a\nchain, this probability must be modified [45]. The function C(\u03b8i )Pz(\u03b8i ) (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ) gives the\nconditional probability to have a contact at \u03b8i , provided that there already is a contact at\n\u0001\n\u03b8i\u22121 and there are a total of z(\u03b8i ) contacts on the grain at \u03b8i . The function p z(\u03b8i ) is the\nprobability to have a grain with z(\u03b8i ) contacts, and the term in the parentheses captures\n\nthe average effect of all possible combinations of contact numbers and angles on each grain\nin the force chain.\nIt is useful to simplify Equation (21) by defining the function PC (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ), where\nC(\u03b8i )PC (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ) gives the probability to have a contact at \u03b8i , given that a contact already exists at \u03b8i\u22121 , averaged over all possible fluctuations in z(\u03b8i ). If we define\n(z \u2212 1)PC (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ) \u2261\n\nX\n\nz(\u03b8i )\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\np z(\u03b8i ) z(\u03b8i ) \u2212 1 Pz(\u03b8i ) (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere z is the average coordination number in the entire network, then Equation (21)\nsimplifies to\nFl (\u03b80 ) =\n\nl\nY\ni=1\n\n(z \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8i\u22121 +2\u03c0/3\n\n\u03b8i\u22121 \u22122\u03c0/3\n\nd\u03b8i cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 )PC (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 )C(\u03b8i )Fbc (\u03b8l ).\n\n(23)\n\nEquation (23) generalizes the sums in Equations (17) and (18) to arbitrary path length l.\nIt does so by averaging over one-particle distribution functions. These come in the form\nof the average collisional force Fbc (\u03b8), the average contact probability on a single grain\nC(\u03b8i )PC (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 ), and the average coordination number z. Naturally, there must not be\ncorrelations between these variables in order for the predictions to apply. The definition of PC\nensures that there are no correlations between the contact probabilities and the coordination\nnumber, but it is not guaranteed that the collisional forces are not correlated with the\nnetwork structure. In fact, when closed loops form in the force networks, the collisional\nforces and network structure do become correlated. Therefore, Equation (23) only applies\nas a mean-field approximation that ignores the correlations induced from loops in the force\n16\n\n\fnetworks. This is a valid approximation since the effect of a collisional force that propagates\naround a loop is reduced by the product of the cosine of the angles around the loop, which\nis quite small compared with direct propagation.\nTo solve the integrals in Equation (23), we change integration variables to xi = \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u22121 .\nThis results in the expression\nFl (\u03b8) =\n\nl\nY\ni=1\n\n(z \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0/3\n\n\u0014\n\ndxi cos(xi )P (xi )C \u03b8 +\n\n\u22122\u03c0/3\n\ni\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nl\nX\nxj Fbc \u03b8 +\nxj ,\n\u0015\n\n(24)\n\nj=1\n\nwhich incorporates the average effect of all forces that propagate through paths of length l\non contacts with orientation \u03b8.\nIn addition to force propagation based on the cosine of the angle between subsequent\ncontacts, we must also incorporate the global constraint from Equation (19). This can be\ngeneralized to\nT (\u03b8) = hFbc (\u03b8)i(z \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0/3\n\n\u22122\u03c0/3\n\ndxPC (x) cos(x)C(\u03b8 + x) \u2264 hFbc (\u03b8)i,\n\n(25)\n\nand restricts the total energy transferred through the network.\nEquations (24) and (25), combined with the basic force network Equation (20), comprise\nthe integral form of the force network model. In order to carry out the integrations, it is\nnecessary to know the functional form of C(\u03b8) and Fbc (\u03b8). These functions are \u03c0-periodic\nand can be written as Fourier Series, keeping only terms that are also \u03c0-periodic. Previous\nresearch on the contact probability [40, 41, 42, 43, 44] has shown that C(\u03b8) is well approximated by keeping only the lowest Fourier terms. We find that Fbc (\u03b8) has the same property.\nWe therefore approximate\n1\n(1 + ac sin 2\u03b8 + a\u2032c cos 2\u03b8),\n2\u03c0\nFbc (\u03b8) = hFbc i(1 + af sin 2\u03b8 + a\u2032f cos 2\u03b8).\nC(\u03b8) =\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nIn Figure 4 we plot data of these functions for a granular material with e = 0 and \u03bd = 0.79,\nalong with a fit to the above equations. The fit is constructed by computing the fabric\n(n)\n\ntensor \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03c3\u0302\u03b1 \u03c3\u0302\u03b2 i and force-fabric tensor \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 = hFbc \u03c3\u0302\u03b1 \u03c3\u0302\u03b2 i/hFbc i, where \u03c3\u0302\u03b1 is the \u03b1\ncomponent of the unit vector between contacting grain centers, Fbc is the collisional force\non the contact, and the average is taken over all contacts. The anisotropies in the contact\nand force distributions {ac , a\u2032c , af , a\u2032f } are related to eigenvalues of the fabric tensors [43],\n17\n\n\fC(\u03b8)\n\n0.3\n(a)\n\nF (\u03b8)\n\n(b)\n\nbc\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 4: Polar plots of measurements (data points) and fits (lines) of (a) the contact probability\ndistribution C(\u03b8) and (b) the collisional force distribution Fbc (\u03b8)/hFbc i for a granular material\nwith e = 0 and \u03bd = 0.79. The lines are fits of Equations (26) and (27), and the values of the\nFourier components are plotted in Figure 5.\n\nwhich are simple to measure. We see from the plots that this first-order approximation for\nthe contact probability and collisional force is quite good.\nWe have measured C(\u03b8) and Fbc (\u03b8) for a wide range of restitution coefficients and packing\nfractions. In Figure 5 we plot the value of the Fourier components from Equations (26)\nand (27), which characterize the functional form in all cases. These plots reveal that the\nanisotropy in both the contact probability and collisional force depends sensitively on the\nvalue of the packing fraction and restitution coefficient. The size of the components is of\norder 10\u22121 whereas the magnitude of the next order coefficients in the Fourier Series is much\nsmaller. This allows us to truncate the series in Equations (26) and (27) at first order and\nstill get good agreement to the actual data, as in Figure 4.\nNow that we have a functional form for C(\u03b8) and Fbc (\u03b8), we can solve for Fl (\u03b8) to first\n\norder in the Fourier components {ac , a\u2032c , af , a\u2032f }.

Thus \u03c3(\u03b8) = h\u03c3i. We can also use this same integral form to determine the collisional\nstress tensor by replacing F (\u03b8) with Fbc (\u03b8).\n19\n\n\fIn this paper we have concentrated on the pressure and shear stress. The pressure is\ngiven by one-half the trace of Equation (33) and the shear stress by either off-diagonal\nelement, but these two quantities do not fully describe the stress tensor. There is a third\nindependent term and, without loss of generality, we use \u03a311 . Inserting the solution for F (\u03b8)\nfrom Equations (20) and (32) into Equation (33), we arrive at the following constitutive\nrelations that fully describe the stress tensor:\n\u03be/\u03beel \u22121\nX\nps \u2212 pbc\n=\nmin[\u03a6(z \u2212 1), 1]l ,\npbc\n\n(34)\n\nl=1\n\n!\n\u03be/\u03beel \u22121\nl\nX\n1 X\nss \u2212 sbc\naf \u03a8l (z \u2212 1)l + ac\n\u03a8i (z \u2212 1)i min[\u03a6(z \u2212 1), 1]l\u2212i ,\n=\npbc\n2 l=1\ni=0\n\n\u03be/\u03beel \u22121\nX\n\u03a3s11 \u2212 \u03a3bc\n11\n=\npbc\nl=1\n\nmin[\u03a6(z \u2212 1), 1]l +\n\na\u2032f l\n\u03a8 (z \u2212 1)l\n2\n!\n\nl\na\u2032c X i\n\u03a8 (z \u2212 1)i min[\u03a6(z \u2212 1), 1]l\u2212i .\n+\n2 i=0\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nThese equations relate the static stress tensor to its collisional values, and properties of\nthe force networks. The left hand side (lhs) of each equation gives the difference between\nthe static and collisional values of stress. These differences are equal to network properties\non the right hand side (rhs) of each equation, which are summed over all possible force\nchain path lengths l in the network. A large number of network parameters appear in\nthese equations and makes the form rather complicated. This is to be expected, since the\nstructure of the force networks is complex and the predictions of Equations (34-36) span\nsystem behavior from very dilute granular materials with \u03c6 \u2248 0 to dense granular materials\nwith \u03c6 arbitrarily close to \u03c6c (and for all restitution coefficients e). The properties of the\nnetworks change considerably over this range of parameter space, and they must be retained\nin the Equations.\nSimple scaling relations can be obtained near certain packing fractions. For example, near\nthe network transition at \u03bdbc , Equations (34-36) predict that (\u03a3s\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03a3bc\n\u03b1\u03b2 ) \u221d (z \u2212 1). This is\nbecause, when \u03be/\u03beel \u2248 1 near \u03bdbc , the deviation from the collisional stress is dominated by\nforces transmitted between nearest neighbors. Therefore the excess number of contacts serves\nas the dominant scaling variable. In contrast, near the jamming transition at \u03bdc , networks\nare saturated so that Equation (19) takes its maximum value and all of the kinetic energy\nfrom each contact is transferred to the network. In this case the stress tensor should depend\n20\n\n\fe=0\ne=0.1\ne=0.25\ne=0.5\ne=0.75\ne=0.92\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\nZ\n\n3\nZ\n2.5\n2\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\ndt\ndt/4\ndt/10\n\n0.2\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\ne=0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03a6\n\n(a)\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\npacking fraction\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u03a8\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n0.4\nPSfrag replacements\n\nz\nz\n\n1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\npacking fraction\n\n\u03a6\n\u03a8\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\npacking fraction\n\nFIG. 6: (a) The coordination number z and (b) \u03a6 and \u03a8 (Equation (29)) for a wide variety of\npacking fractions and restitution coefficients. The line labels (e-values) in (b) are the same as\nin (a). Although z and \u03a8 depend sensitively on the value of \u03bd and e, the value of \u03a6 is always\napproximately 0.83.\n\non the size of the networks, and the constitutive relations indeed predict that \u03a3s\u03b1\u03b2 \u221d \u03be. This\nscaling is especially interesting since it suggests that the size of the networks is the important\nscaling variable, which might also control other features of the jamming transition. Indeed,\nonce \u03be becomes large, it is clusters of grains, and not individual grains, that serve as the\nbasic thermodynamic degrees of freedom.\nFinally, we consider the limit of \u03be/\u03beel \u2192 1 where force networks consist of only two grains.\n\nIn this limit the force network model predicts that \u03a3s\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03a3bc\n\u03b1\u03b2 , which is the appropriate result\nin the dilute regime where kinetic theory holds.\n\nC.\n\nTesting the predictions\n\nEquations (34-36) make predictions for all independent components of the stress tensor\nover the complete range of e and for \u03c6 < \u03c6c . The difference between the static and collisional\nvalues of stress is related to features of the force networks. These include the anisotropies\nin the contact probability and collisional force {ac , a\u2032c , af , a\u2032f }, the size of the force networks\n\u03be/\u03beel , the average coordination number z, and a pair of geometric variables {\u03a6, \u03a8} that are\ndefined in Equation (29) and are related to the distribution of contacts on single grains. All\nof these variables except z, \u03a6, and \u03a8 have been measured previously in this paper or in\nRef. [2]. Our next step is to measure z, \u03a6, and \u03a8.\n21\n\n\fIn Figure 6 we plot the values of z, \u03a6, and \u03a8 as measured in our simulations. We measure\nz by averaging over long-lived contacts, which are pairs of contacting grains that were also\ncontacting in the previous time step. This ensures that only the static backbone of the force\nnetwork is considered and that transient contacts do not artificially increase the coordination\nnumber. This measurement does not depend on the time step, as shown in the inset. We\nalso measure \u03a6 and \u03a8, as prescribed in Equations (22) and (29), by averaging over the same\nset of contacts. We observe that \u03a8 < \u03a6 for all granular materials we have considered.\nWe have now measured every variable in the constitutive relations of Equations (34-36).\nWe can therefore test the validity of the predictions without using any fitting parameters.\nDue to the complexity of the equations, it is convenient to plot the right hand side (rhs)\nof each equation versus the left hand side (lhs). This is shown in Figure 7 using all of the\ndata we have collected. Plotted in this way, the data for each component of the stress tensor\ncollapses onto the line predicted by the force network model over more than four decades.\nThis collapse is especially striking since the variables in the predictions have a wide variance\nas a function of both restitution coefficient and packing fraction.\nThe collapse of our data onto the predicted curves suggests that the force network model\ncaptures an essential property of granular materials over a broad range of densities and\nrestitution coefficients. The success of the model is based on visualizing granular materials\nas conglomerates of interacting networks, instead of collections of grains. Thus the packing\nfraction and restitution coefficient, which are grain properties, are substituted by the size,\ncoordination, and other properties of the networks. This allows for constitutive relations to\nbe determined analytically.\nFinally, it is important to remark that the constitutive relations from the force network\nmodel have been derived in the limit of perfectly rigid grains, which may not always apply to\nrealistic flows with finite grain stiffness. In the case of finite grain stiffness, there is a finite\nspeed vc at which forces propagate through the network. Combined with the lifetime of\nthe networks \u03c4c , this sets a maximum correlation length vc \u03c4c , since information can only be\ntransferred between a pair of grains if the network exists long enough to propagate it. This\nmaximum correlation length is a monotonically increasing function of the grain stiffness. If\nvc \u03c4c > \u03be, then the stress tensor can be described by Equations (34-36). However, if vc \u03c4c < \u03be,\nit is necessary to replace the length scale \u03be with vc \u03c4c . Because \u03be diverges as the material\napproaches the jamming limit and vc \u03c4c is always finite, we expect that for a given grain\n22\n\n\f1\n\ne=0\ne=0.1\ne=0.25\ne=0.5\ne=0.75\ne=0.92\nprediction\n\n10\n\n0\n\nlhs\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nPrediction from Eqn.

This critical packing fraction is\nalways in the inertial regime and must be strictly less than \u03bdc . Therefore, very close to\njamming, the elasticity of grains begins to play an important role. For all other packing\nfractions, the assumption of perfectly rigid grains is valid for natural and experimental flows.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe underlying microscopic interactions between grains have a large influence on macroscopic characteristics of granular flow. We have investigated two models of the stress tensor\u2013\nkinetic theory and the force network model\u2013 which make different assumptions about the\nmicroscopic interactions. Kinetic theory assumes that only binary collisions are relevant\nand calculates the stress tensor based on grain properties, whereas the force network model\nallows simultaneous interaction between many grains and calculates the stress tensor based\non properties of the resultant force networks.\nFor dilute flows, which occur when the size of the force networks is small, kinetic theory\nmakes accurate predictions. This is not surprising since small force networks imply localized\ninteractions and binary collisions. For dense flows, force networks extend beyond pairs of\ngrains and the predictions of kinetic theory no longer match data from simulations. This is\nbecause grain-grain correlations are induced via the force networks and kinetic theory does\nnot take them into account. However, correlations never exist between isolated networks,\nand by constructing the force network model based on network properties, we are able to\naccurately predict the stress tensor for both dilute and dense flows.\nThe force network model predicts all independent components of the stress tensor over\nthe entire inertial regime and matches data from simulations for more than four decades.\nExtensions of the model could be used to predict other quantities, including the contact\nforce distribution function P (f ). An integral part of any such theory is the finite size of the\nforce networks, which has important effects on the qualitative features of P (f ) [2]. Further\nextensions could also specify relations between network parameters and thereby simplify\nthe constitutive equations (34-36). While it is possible that the relations between network\nparameters are complicated and depend on many factors, it is likely that simple scalings\nexist near the network transition at \u03bdbc . For \u03bd \u2248 \u03bdbc the deviation between the static and\ncollisional stress tensors is proportional to (z\u22121) and it is likely that network parameters also\n24\n\n\fscale with powers of (z \u2212 1). In particular, it would be interesting to probe the dependence\nof \u03be on (z \u2212 1), although fluctuations in the parameters have complicated our measurement\nof this relation.\nFinally, while we have concentrated on the inertial regime, it is also important to understand how natural flows make the transition from dynamics dominated by inertia, to\nquasi-static dynamics, and ultimately to how the system jams. Along this sequence, the\nstiffness of the grains plays an increasingly active role in the dynamics. The force network\nmodel can accommodate the development of stiffness by incorporating a maximum length\nscale through which forces can propagate. Including this mechanism for a granular material\nmoving through \u03bdc may help connect the dense inertial regime with the quasi-static regime\nand facilitate a more complete understanding of dry granular materials.\nThis work was supported by the William M.
