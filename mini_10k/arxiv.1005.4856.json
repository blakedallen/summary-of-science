For the pnictides, both the static magnetic order in the parent compound\nand the \"resonance\" in the superconducting compounds occur\naround the in-plane wave vector (0.5,0.5) (using the 2-Fe unit\ncell), suggesting a \"collinear\" or \"C-type\" AF structure [see\nFig. 1 (a)].11,24,25\nThe situation is slightly different in another Fe-based superconductor family, the iron chalcogenide Fe1+\u03b4 Sex Te1\u2212x\n(the \"1:1\" compound). Here the parent compound has a \"bicollinear\" or \"E-type\" AF order [see Fig. 1 (b)],24\u201327 modulated along the (0.5, 0) in-plane direction. Furthermore, the\nsubstitution of Se for Te, which induces superconductivity,\ndoes not directly modify the density of electrons in the conduction bands. Despite these differences, the spin resonance\nobserved in the superconducting compositions of this family\nhas been found to occur at the same (0.5, 0.5) in-plane wavevector,28\u201334 as in the Fe pnictides, but rotated 45\u25e6 from the\nordering wave-vector of the parent FeTe compound. This sug-\n\ngests that the superconducting mechanism in the Fe pnictides\nand chalcogenides are likely to be quite similar. Nevertheless,\nthere has also been a report implying that superconductivity can coexist with the \"bicollinear\" structure on the atomic\nscale.35 Therefore, understanding how the magnetic structure\n(static or dynamic) evolves from the E-type bicollinear configuration of the parent compound to the C-type collinear configuration in the superconducting region in the 1:1 system is an\nimportant problem. There have been a number of theoretical\nstudies24,36 that provide some insight on this issue, but clearly\na more systematic experimental study is highly desirable.\nIn this paper, we present our work using neutron scattering\nto probe the magnetic order/fluctuations in a few samples from\nthe 1:1 family for Se dopings ranging from 30% to 50% and\nwith varying superconducting properties. Our results suggest\nthat static magnetic order exists in all non-superconducting\nsamples. (Here, by non-superconducting we mean an absence of bulk superconductivity.) This order is short-ranged\nand occur at in-plane wave-vectors of the type (0.5, 0). For\nthe fully superconducting samples, no static magnetic order\nis found. With the disappearance of static magnetic order,\nthe associated low energy magnetic excitations near (0.5, 0)\nalso go away, as one might expect. Magnetic excitations\nnear (0.5, 0.5) gradually become dominant as the material becomes more superconducting. While Se doping plays an essential role, it is clearly not the only determining factor regarding the superconductivity and the magnetic correlations.\nSamples with similar Se doping but differing in Fe content\ncan have very different superconducting properties and corresponding magnetic structures/fluctuations. Our results clearly\nindicate that static bicollinear (E-type) magnetic orders in the\n1:1 system compete with and suppress superconductivity. Superconductivity only appears when the system evolves toward\na fluctuating collinear C-type magnetic correlations, which\nappear to be universal across all known Fe-based supercon-\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: List of the Fe1+\u03b4 Sex Te1\u2212x samples used in our measurements, with their composition (\u03b4, x), superconducting transition temperature (Tc ), room-temperature lattice parameters (from powder xray diffraction), and crystal mass.\nSample\n\n\u03b4\n\nx\n\nSC30\nNSC30\nSC50\nNSC45\n\n0.00\n0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n\n0.3\n0.3\n0.5\n0.45\n\nTc\n(K)\n14\n\u2013\n14\n\u2013\n\na\n(\u00c5)\n3.815\n3.808\n3.811\n3.807\n\nc\n(\u00c5)\n6.140\n6.120\n6.129\n6.047\n\nmass\n(g)\n12.7\n7.4\n9.0\n6.4\n\nat around 14 K, SC50 is clearly better in quality as far as superconducting volume fraction is concerned. With a considerable portion of its bulk volume being non-superconducting,\nit is possible that there is phase separation in SC30. In fact,\nwhen measuring different small pieces (\u223c 1 mm size) from\nthe same SC30 sample, the superconducting volume can vary\nfrom . 10% to \u223c 80%, suggesting that the superconducting and nonsuperconducting phases could be macroscopically\nseparated in this sample.

The samples, their nominal compositions, and various characteristic\nproperties are listed in Table I. The bulk susceptibility results\nin Fig. 2 were obtained using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. From the magnetization measurements we can see that, although both superconducting samples show evidence of diamagnetic response\n\nNeutron scattering experiments have been carried out on\nthe triple-axis spectrometers SPINS (inelastic scattering measurements of magnetic excitations for SC30 and NSC30, and\nall elastic measurements for static magnetic order), and BT7 (inelastic scattering measurements for SC50 and NSC45)\nlocated at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. We used\nhorizontal beam collimations of Guide-80\u2032-S-80\u2032 -240\u2032 (S represents \"sample\") for the inelastic scattering measurements\non SPINS with fixed final energy of 5 meV and a cooled Be\nfilter after the sample to reduce higher-order neutrons; collimations of Guide-open-S-80\u2032-240\u2032 were used for the elastic measurements on SPINS, with an additional Be filter before the sample. At BT7, we used beam collimations of\nopen-50\u2032-S-50\u2032 -240\u2032 with fixed final energy of 14.7 meV and\ntwo pyrolytic graphite filters after the sample. The inelastic\nscattering measurements have been performed in the (HK0)\nscattering plane, as indicated in Fig. 1(c). The data are described in reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) of (a\u2217 , b\u2217 , c\u2217 ) =\n(2\u03c0/a, 2\u03c0/b, 2\u03c0/c). The elastic scattering measurements\n\n\f3\nhave been taken in the (H0L) scattering plane instead, since\nthe order in the parent compound occurs at half integer L\nvalues (AF order along the c-axis). All data have been normalized into absolute units (\u03bcB 2 *eV\u22121 /Fe), using incoherent\nelastic scattering intensities from the samples.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Elastic neutron scattering measurements performed on SC30 (top) and NC45 (bottom) near (0.5, 0, 0.5). (a) and\n(b) are intensity profiles along [100] direction (H-scans); (c) and (d)\nare scans along [001] direction (L-scans). (e) and (f) show the magnetic peak intensity at (0.5, 0, 0.5) vs. temperature. Corresponding\nscans measured at T = 34 K are used as background, and have\nbeen subtracted from all the data shown. The error bars represent the\nsquare root of the number of counts.\n\nThe static long-range magnetic order in the parent compound FeTe appears near (0.5, 0, 0.5), suggesting a bicollinear\nE-type AF structure. With small Se doping, it was suggested\nthat the order should gradually become short-ranged27,37 and\neventually disappear. Our results, however, suggest that the\norder can still remain with relatively large Se dopings.\nWe performed elastic magnetic scattering measurements on\nall samples. For the SC50 sample, there is no elastic magnetic\nintensity at (0.5, 0, 0.5), while magnetic peaks are observed\nfor all three other samples. In Fig. 3, we plot H and L scans\nthrough this AF wave-vector for the SC30 and NSC45 samples at T = 4 K. The same measurements for NSC30 have\nbeen published in a previous report (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 27).\nThe H and L scans performed at higher temperature (T=34 K)\nshow no peak structure and are therefore used as backgrounds\nto be subtracted from the data. All peaks are much broader\nthan the resolution, indicating the short-ranged nature of the\n\nmagnetic order. The H-scans are peaked near but not exactly\nat H = 0.5, similar to the results reported for NSC30 and another sample with 27% Se doping.27 The L-scans, however,\nare qualitatively different. In previous reports on lower Se\ndoped 1:1 compounds,27,32 the L-scan peaks around L = 0.5,\nand intensity always goes to zero at L = 0. So there the magnetic order is always AF along the L-direction, whether shortor long-ranged. Here we see that after background subtraction, the scattering intensity at L = 0 is still appreciable. This\nsuggests that although the magnetic order still has a modulation along the L-direction, which peaks around L = 0.5,\nfavoring an AF configuration between Fe planes, the order\nhas become much more two-dimensional. In the NSC45 sample, the 3D long-range bicollinear AF magnetic order of the\nparent compound has not been entirely destroyed, but rather\ngreatly reduced to 2D short-range order. The ordered moment\nper Fe is 0.015(4) \u03bc2B , much less than the value in the parent\ncompound with long-range order.26 It is nevertheless, enough\nto destroy superconductivity. With this static magnetic order\npresent, even with 45% Se doping, bulk superconductivity is\nstill not achieved. In the SC30 sample, although the sample\ndoes show a superconducting phase transition at around 14 K,\nthe superconducting volume is smaller than for the SC50 sample. The ordered moment is about 0.006(2) \u03bc2B /Fe, also much\nless than that in the NSC45 sample, indicating that this order\nmay be coming from only part of the sample. Therefore there\nis likely a phase separation in this SC30 sample, where two\nphases, one superconducting and another one with a shortrange magnetic order, coexist.\nWith the tendency of forming static bicollinear magnetic\nstructures in the non-superconducting samples, it is natural to\nexpect to see magnetic excitation spectra around the (0.5,0)\nin-plane wave-vector as well. Previous work has shown that\nthe energy dispersion and intensity modulation along the L\ndirection for magnetic excitations in the 1:1 compound is\nsmall.28,32 We can therefore choose to perform the inelastic\nscattering measurements in the (HK0) plane for L = 0. In\nFig. 4, we plot our results taken near (0.5, 0, 0). The top two\npanels [Fig. 4 (a) and (b)] show energy scans at (0.5, 0, 0)\nat T = 4 K and 25 K. Measurements for NSC45 and SC50\nwere taken on BT7 with a relatively coarse energy resolution\n(FWHM \u223c 1.7meV) compared to those on SPINS (NSC30\nand SC30, FWHM \u223c 0.3 meV), and have a large, resolutionlimited tail from scattering at ~\u03c9 = 0. Constant-energy scans\nat ~\u03c9 = 0.5, 2, and 5 meV [Fig. 4 (c) to (h)] along the K direction across (0.5, 0, 0) clearly show that for NSC30, SC30\nand NSC45, there is significant spectral weight at low energies\nhere. For both 30%-Se samples, where we have measurements\nwith higher energy resolution, one can see that the intensity at\n~\u03c9 = 0.5 meV increases on warming from 4 K to 25 K. The\nincrease is much less pronounced at ~\u03c9 = 5 meV. This behavior is likely due to a transfer of spectral weight from the\nelastic peak into low energy channels when the static order\ndissolves with heating. For SC50, the low-energy spin excitations near (0.5, 0, 0) are weak, and not strongly temperature\ndependent, which is consistent with the fact that there is no\nstatic order near (0.5,0) in this sample.

For\nSC50, a clear \"resonance\" is observed when comparing the\nenergy scans performed at 4 K and 25 K [see Fig. 5 (a) and\n(b)]. In panels (c) to (h), constant-energy scans at ~\u03c9 =5,\n6.5 and 12 meV performed in the direction transverse to Q =\n(0.5, 0.5) are shown. Similar to SC50, but less pronounced,\nwe can also see a \"resonance\" feature in SC30 in the scans of\n~\u03c9 = 6.5 and 5 meV.\nFor the non-superconducting samples, there is no temperature effect observed for data taken between 4 K and 25 K. For\nNSC30, we did a constant-energy scan near (0.5, 0.5) only at\n~\u03c9 = 6.5 meV, and the intensity is very low compared to either its own magnetic scattering near (0.5, 0) or those from\nthe other samples near (0.5, 0.5). It is clear that the low energy spin excitations are mostly focused around (0.5, 0) for\nNSC30. The NSC45 sample has Se doping very close to\nSC50, and also very similar magnetic excitation spectrum near\n(0.5, 0.5) compared to that from the latter in its normal state\n(T = 25 K). However, with no superconducting transition, its\nspectrum at low temperature (T = 4 K) does not differ much\nfrom that at T = 25 K.\nThe implications of our results are very clear for NSC30\nand SC50. For NSC30, a short-ranged static magnetic order\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Magnetic excitations for Fe1+\u03b4 Sex Te1\u2212x\nmeasured around (0.5, 0.5, 0).

Its low energy magnetic excitations are also focused near (0.5, 0). With the static\norder present, no superconductivity is achieved in this sample. For the SC50 sample, there is no static order and the low\nenergy magnetic excitation spectrum is mostly shifted to the\n(0.5, 0.5) region, corresponding to collinear C-type spin correlations. Similar to the situation in the \"122\"17,18 or \"1111\"\nsystems,11\u201316 this collinear configuration without static order\nappears to favor superconductivity.\nThe results for NSC45 are more complicated. Here, with\nSe doping close to SC50, the magnetic excitations near the\n(0.5, 0.5) point are rather similar to the superconductor, except that the \"resonance\" feature is missing. Apparently, having magnetic excitations near (0.5, 0.5) associated with the\ncollinear spin configuration is not sufficient for superconductivity to emerge. Also having a static 2D-like magnetic order\nwith bicollinear structure is able to completely suppress superconductivity in this sample. Of course, the tetragonal crystal structure gives no energetic distinction between the ordering wave vectors (0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0.5), so that the magnetic\nconfiguration is relatively soft. There is likely a mixed phase\nwhere the bicollinear and collinear magnetic configurations\ncoexist, on a microscopic level, similar to that of the mixed\nC-E phase in manganites,38 as suggested in Ref. 24\nThe case for SC30 is, in fact, quite intriguing. A 2D-like\n\n\f5\nshort-range static order exists at low temperature, while low\nenergy magnetic excitations are found both around (0.5, 0)\nand (0.5, 0.5) with comparable spectral weight. Therefore,\nthe magnetic excitation spectrum actually looks very similar to that in NSC45, yet there is bulk superconductivity in\nSC30 when the static magnetic order is also present. Compared to NSC45, the ratio of spectral weight near (0.5,0.5) to\nthat near (0.5,0) is higher in SC30, indicating a larger volume of the sample favoring a collinear spin configuration.\nThe \"resonance\" occurs below Tc , showing an enhancement\nof spectral weight only near (0.5, 0.5). This indicates that\nsuperconductivity only exists in the part of the sample with\ndynamic collinear spin correlations. Although it is conceivable that the static order and superconductivity could coexist\nin the same domains as suggested by previous \u03bcSR work,35\nit is also possible to have a system with macroscopic phase\nseparation, where the volume of local collinear or bicollinear\nregions are large enough to form separate domains. In this\ncase, the features near (0.5, 0) (elastic magnetic peak and low\nenergy magnetic excitations), and those near (0.5, 0.5) come\nfrom different regions. This scenario would be consistent with\nthe (varying) susceptibility results for different small pieces\ntaken at different locations from this sample, and agrees with\nresults from all other samples where static magnetic order and\nsuperconductivity do not coexist locally.\nWhy would samples with similar Se content (e.g., NSC30\nvs. SC30, NSC45 vs. SC50) show dramatically different behaviors? It is clear from previous work that the Fe content\nhas a significant impact on the magnetism.26,27 For example,\nhigher Fe content in the parent compound can drive the order from commensurate to incommensurate,26 while its effect\nhas been less clear for the superconducting region. It seems\nunlikely that the excess Fe atoms act simply as isolated magnetic moments that destroy the superconductivity, since our\nobservations of variations in static magnetic order and low\nenergy spin excitations cannot be explained in such a simple\nmanner. Theoretically, it has been predicted that lowering the\nheight of the chalcogen (Te/Se) positions can drive the \"1:1\"\nsystem from the bicollinear to the collinear spin configuration,24,39 and Fe interstitials will certainly have an impact on\nFe-Te/Se-Fe bond lengths and bond angles.

If the magnetic correlations in the\nsystem favor a bicollinear (E-type) spin configuration, which\nsometimes can eventually lead to static order, superconductivity is suppressed. The collinear (C-type) spin configuration,\nwhich is universal across the superconducting regions of all\nFe-based superconductor families, is necessary, but not sufficient, for the emergence of bulk superconductivity. There are\ncases where magnetic correlations favoring these two configurations coexist and compete. Overall, our results suggest that\nmagnetic correlations are important in the Fe-based superconductor families, and the proper tuning of these correlations\nmay be the key for enhancing superconductivity.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Weiguo Yin and Wei Ku for useful discussions.\nWork at Brookhaven is supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Science and Engineering,\nU.S. Department of Energy (DOE), under Contract No. DEAC02-98CH10886.
