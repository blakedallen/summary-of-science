The mass of the white dwarf slowly increases until it approaches the\nChandrasekhar limit where the star becomes thermally unstable. At this point fusion of\nCarbon and Oxygen begins near the center and quickly moves through most of the star before\ndegeneracy is lifted. The result is a spectacular and powerful explosion that is visible across\nmuch of the Universe. Since SN Ia arise from a narrow range of white dwarf masses, their peak\nluminosities are very consistent and they make excellent distance indicators (e.g., Phillips\n1993). SN Ia are powerful probes of cosmology and have been instrumental in narrowing the\nuncertainty in the Hubble parameter, discovery of the accelerating universe, and constraining\ndark energy models (Hamuy et al. 1995, 1996b; Riess et al. 2005, 1998; Perlmutter et al.\n1999; Riess et al. 2004; Astier et al. 2006; Riess et al. 2006; Wood-Vasey et al. 2007).\nBut the use of SN Ia as reliable distance indicators will always be questioned until the\nprogenitor and explosion physics are well-understood. What types of binaries create SN Ia?\nHow is matter transferred to the white dwarf without causing thermonuclear runaways on\nthe surface? Are there several types of progenitors?. These big questions remain to be\nanswered and detailed observations of hundreds of events have yielded few clues.\nIn 2002, Hamuy et al. (2003) identified a new kind of supernova. The early spectrum\nof SN 2002ic was a cross between a Type Ia event and a Type IIn (Deng et al. 2004, have\ncalled this type of supernova a \"IIa\"), showing P-Cygni features similar to SN Ia and resolved\nBalmer lines in emission. Type IIn supernovae are core-collapse explosions going off in dense\ncircumstellar environments (Schlegel 1990; Chevalier & Fransson 1994). They are relatively\ncommon since the massive stars that create core-collapse supernovae often have thick winds.\nIf the interpretations of the pre-explosion observations of SN 2005gl are correct, SN IIn could\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nbe associated in some cases with luminous blue variables (Gal-Yam et al. 2006).\nIn the case of SN 2002ic, the presence of Balmer lines with profiles characteristic of\nSN IIn, and the high luminosities and slow decline after maximum lead to the conclusion\nthat most of the energy came from the interaction of the ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Other Type IIn events (SN 1997cy, Germany et al. 2000; SN 1999E,\nRigon et al. 2003) have been re-classified as SN 2002ic-like that were caught late in their\nevolution (Hamuy et al. 2003; Wood-Vasey et al. 2004).\nSN 2002ic provided the first direct evidence that thermonuclear explosions can also occur in a dense medium, but in this case the circumstellar medium is probably generated by an\nAsymptotic Giant companion (Hamuy et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2004; Han & Podsiadlowski\n2006). However, there is still debate in the literature about the origin of SN 2002ic.\nLivio & Riess (2003) proposed the merger of two white dwarfs as a possible progenitor,\nwith the explosion occurring in the common envelope phase. Chugai et al. (2004) concluded\nthat the properties of the circumstellar interaction in 2002ic-like events can be broadly explained by the SN 1.5 scenario (Iben & Renzini 1983): the thermonuclear explosion of the\ndegenerate core of a massive AGB star. Recently, Benetti et al. (2006) questioned the earlier\ninterpretation of the observations and proposed that SN 2002ic can be equally well explained\nby the core collapse of a stripped-envelope massive star in a dense medium.\nSN 2005gj was discovered on 2005 September 28.6 (UT) by the SDSS-II Supernova Collaboration (Frieman et al. 2007) in gri images obtained with the SDSS-2.5m telescope at\nApache Point Observatory (APO). The new supernova (Barentine et al. 2005) was \u223c1\u2032\u2032 from\nthe center of its host galaxy at the position \u03b1 = 03h 01m 12.s 0, \u03b4 = +00\u25e6 33\u2032 13.\u2032\u2032 9 (J2000.0). It\nhad SDSS magnitudes (g, r, i) = (18.6, 18.6, 18.7) mag, obtained from PSF photometry after\nkernel-matching and subtraction of a template image in each band. The SN was independently discovered by the Nearby Supernova Factory on 2005 September 29 (Aldering et al.\n2006).\nSN 2005gj was classified as a Type Ia candidate from the first three epochs of the gri\nlight curve using a light curve fitting program, and was sent to the queue of the MDM-2.4m\ntelescope for spectroscopic confirmation. The optical spectrum obtained on 2005 October\n1 (UT) showed a blue continuum with resolved Hydrogen Balmer lines in emission, very\nsimilar to the spectrum of a young Type IIn supernova, but also with an unusual continuum\nshowing broad and weak absorption features. Further spectroscopic follow-up showed a\ndramatic evolution. The continuum became substantially redder and developed broad, PCygni features probably associated with blended lines of Fe-peak mass elements, similar to a\nType Ia SN a few weeks after maximum. The spectrum obtained on 2005 Nov. 12 (UT) was\nremarkably similar to that of the unusual Type Ia supernova SN 2002ic obtained on 2002\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nDec. 27 (UT) (Prieto et al. 2005).\nAldering et al. (2006) presented optical photometry and spectroscopy of this SN. Through\ndetailed analysis they confirmed its photometric and spectroscopic resemblance to SN 2002ic,\nconfirming it was a new case of a Type Ia explosion interacting with a dense circumstellar\nenvironment. From a spectrum obtained with the slit oriented to overlap with its host galaxy,\nthey calculated a redshift for the host of z = 0.0616 \u00b1 0.0002. SN 2005gj was not detected\nin the radio with the Very Large Array (Soderberg & Frail 2005) or in the X-ray with Swift\n(Immler et al. 2005).\nHere we present extensive follow-up photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia/Type IIn\nSN 2005gj during the first \u223c150 days after discovery. These are the most detailed observations ever obtained of a SN 2002ic-like event, and provide insight into the early evolution,\nprogenitor, and variety of these events. We also present a sensitive, early X-ray observation\nwith Chandra that gives an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of this peculiar object. We\ndescribe the optical and NIR photometry of SN 2005gj in \u00a7 2 and the optical spectroscopy\nin \u00a7 3. We describe the X-ray observation with Chandra in \u00a7 4. An analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data are presented in \u00a7 5. Finally, we discuss the significance of\nthe results in \u00a7 6. We will present later photometric follow-up and Spitzer/IRAC observations in Paper II. We adopt a cosmology with H0 = 72 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7 throughout the paper (see Spergel et al. 2006), which yields a distance modulus of\n\u03bc = 37.15 mag to the host of SN 2005gj.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nPhotometry\nSDSS and MDM\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) uses a wide-field, 2.5-meter\ntelescope (Gunn et al. 2006) and mosaic CCD camera (Gunn et al. 1998) at APO to survey the sky. The SDSS-II Supernova Survey, part of a 3-year extension of the original\nSDSS, uses the APO-2.5m telescope to detect and measure light-curves for a large number of supernovae through repeat scans of the SDSS Southern equatorial stripe (about\n2.5 deg wide by \u223c120 deg long) over the course of three 3-month campaigns (Sept-Nov.\n2005-2007). SN 2005gj was discovered in the second month of the first campaign (October 2005). Twenty epochs of ugriz photometry were obtained between 2005 Sep 26-Nov 30\n(U.T.). Details of the photometric system, magnitude system, astrometry and calibration are\ngiven in Fukugita et al. (1996), Lupton et al. (1999), Hogg et al. (2001), Smith et al. (2002),\nPier et al. (2003), Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2004), and Tucker et al. (2006). Additional griz imaging of\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSN 2005gj was obtained with the MDM Observatory 2.4m telescope using a facility CCD\nimager (RETROCAM; see Morgan et al. 2005, for a complete description of the imager).\nPhotometry of SN 2005gj on the SDSS images was carried out using the scene modeling\ncode developed for SDSS-II as described in Holtzman et al. (2007). A sequence of stars\naround the supernova were taken from the list of Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2007), who derived standard\nSDSS magnitudes from multiple observations taken during the main SDSS survey under\nphotometric conditions. Using these stars, frame scalings and astrometric solutions were\nderived for each of the supernova frames, as well as for the twenty five pre-supernova frames\ntaken as part of either the main SDSS survey or the SN survey. Finally, the entire stack of\nframes was simultaneously fit for a single supernova position, a fixed galaxy background in\neach filter (characterized by a grid of galaxy intensities), and the supernova brightness in\neach frame.\nThe supernova photometry in the MDM frames was also determined using the scene\nmodeling code. Since the MDM observations had different response functions from the\nstandard SDSS bandpasses, the photometric frame solutions included color terms from the\nSDSS standard magnitudes. To prevent uncertainties in the frame parameters and color\nterms from possibly corrupting the galaxy model (here affecting the SDSS photometry),\nthe MDM data were not included in the galaxy determination, but the galaxy model as\ndetermined from the SDSS was used (with color terms) to subtract the galaxy in the MDM\nframes. The resulting SN photometry from the MDM frames is reported on the native MDM\nsystem, since the color terms derived from stars are likely not to apply to the spectrum of\nthe supernova.\nFigure 1 shows a 3.5\u2032 \u00d7 3.5\u2032 field around SN 2005gj and 16 comparison stars used for\ncalibration of the SN magnitudes by SDSS and the Carnegie Supernova Group (CSP; see\n\u00a7 2.2 below for details). In Table 1 we present the SDSS ugriz and CSP u\u2032 g \u2032 r \u2032 i\u2032 photometry\nof the comparison stars in common. The final SDSS and MDM griz photometry is given in\nTable 2.\n\n2.2.\n\nCSP\n\nOptical photometry from the CSP was obtained with the Swope-1m telescope at LCO,\nusing a SITe CCD and a set of u\u2032 g \u2032 r \u2032 i\u2032 filters. A subraster of 1200 \u00d7 1200 pixels was read\nfrom the center of the CCD, which, at a scale of 0.435 \u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 , yielded a field of view\nof 8.7\u2032 \u00d7 8.7\u2032 . Typical image quality ranged between 1\u2032\u2032 and 2\u2032\u2032 (FWHM). A photometric\nsequence of comparison stars in the SN field was calibrated with the Swope telescope from\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nobservations of SDSS standard stars from Smith et al. (2002) during four photometric nights.\nSN magnitudes in the u\u2032 g \u2032 r \u2032 i\u2032 system were obtained differentially relative to the comparison\nstars using PSF photometry. In order to minimize the contamination from the host galaxy\nlight in the SN magnitudes, PSF-matched ugri template images from SDSS were subtracted\nfrom the SN images. On every galaxy-subtracted image, a PSF was fitted to the SN and\ncomparison stars within a radius of 3\u2032\u2032 . See Hamuy et al. (2006) for further details about\nthe measurement procedures.\nThe NIR photometry of SN 2005gj was obtained by the CSP using three different instruments/telescopes. A total of 15 epochs in Y , J and H filters were obtained using RetroCam,\nmounted on the Swope-1m telescope at LCO. A few additional epochs in Y JHKs were obtained with the Wide Infrared Camera (WIRC; Persson et al. 2002) mounted on the duPont2.5m telescope, and the PANIC camera (Martini et al. 2004) mounted on the Magellan-6.5m\nBaade telescope, both at LCO. We refer to Hamuy et al. (2006) and Phillips et al. (2007)\nfor details of the imagers and procedures to extract the SN photometry. The host galaxy\nwas not subtracted from the NIR frames; therefore the SN photometry contains an unknown\ngalaxy contamination component.\nThe final CSP u\u2032 g \u2032 r \u2032 i\u2032 photometry of SN 2005gj is given in Table 3 and Y JHKs photometry in Table 4. A minimum uncertainty of 0.015 mag in the optical bandpasses and\n0.02 mag in the NIR is assumed for a single measurement based on the typical scatter in\nthe transformation from instrumental to standard magnitudes of bright stars (Hamuy et al.\n2006).\n\n3.\n\nSpectroscopy\n\nThe spectroscopic observations of SN 2005gj are summarized in Table 6. They were\nobtained using five different telescopes/instruments at four observatories.\nA total of twelve spectra were obtained between early-October 2005 and late-January\n2006 with the Boller & Chivens CCD Spectrograph (CCDS) mounted at the MDM-2.4m telescope. This instrument uses a Loral 1200\u00d7800 pixel CCD with 15 \u03bcm pixel\u22121 and a 150 l/mm\ngrating (blazed at 4700 \u00c5). We used a 2\u2032\u2032 slit which gives a dispersion of 3.1 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 in the\nwavelength range \u223c3800\u20137300 \u00c5.\nEight spectra were obtained at LCO with the Wide Field Reimaging Camera (WFCCD)\nand the Modular Spectrograph (ModSpec) at the duPont-2.5m telescope, and LDSS-3 at the\nClay-6.5m telescope. In the case of WFCCD a 400 l/mm grism and a 1.6\u2032\u2032 slit were used,\nreaching a dispersion of 3 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 in the wavelength range \u223c3800\u20139200 \u00c5. For ModSpec we\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nused a 300 l/mm grating and a 1\u2032\u2032 slit that gave a dispersion of 2.45 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 in the range\n\u223c3800\u20137300 \u00c5. Further details of WFCCD and ModSpec can be found in Hamuy et al.\n(2006). For LDSS-3, which employs a STA0500A 4064 \u00d7 4064 pixel CCD, we used the VPH\nblue and red grisms, the latter with an OG590 filter to block second order contamination,\nwith a 0.75\u2032\u2032 slit reaching a dispersion of 0.70 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 and 1.12 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 in the blue and\nred sides of the spectrum, respectively.\nAdditionally we obtained two early spectra with the Double Imaging Spectrograph (DIS)\nmounted on the ARC-3.5m telescope at APO, and one spectrum with the Intermediate\ndispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS) at the WHT-4.2m telescope at the\nRoque de Los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain. The DIS spectrograph has blue\nand red detectors, each uses a Marconi 2048 \u00d7 1024 pixel CCD with 13.5 \u03bcm pixel\u22121 . We\nused a 300 l/mm grating and a 1.5\u2032\u2032 slit which gives a dispersion of 2.4 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 . The ISIS\nspectrograph has a blue and red arm, the blue arm using a EEV12 CCD and the red using\na MARCONI2 detector. We used a 300 l/mm grating in both the blue and red arm and a\n1\u2032\u2032 slit, which gives a dispersion of 0.86 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 in the blue and 1.47 \u00c5 pixel\u22121 in the red.\nMost of the spectra were obtained close to the parallactic angle to minimize relative\nchanges in the calibration of the blue and red parts of the spectrum due to differential refraction through the atmosphere. The spectroscopic reductions were performed using standard\nIRAF tasks and included: bias and overscan subtraction, flat-fielding, combination of 2-4\nindividual 2D spectra to reach the best signal-to-noise ratio in the final image, tracing and\nextraction of a 1D spectrum from the combined 2D image, subtracting the background sky\naround the selected aperture, wavelength calibration using an arc-lamp, and flux calibration.\nIn order to flux calibrate the spectra we observed 1-2 spectrophotometric standard stars per\nnight. The spectra from LCO, WHT and MDM were corrected by atmospheric telluric lines\nusing the spectrum of a hot spectrophotometric standard star and the spectra from APO\nwere corrected using a model atmosphere. This correction is not optimal for some of the\nspectra and there are evident residuals left in the corrected spectra.\nFigure 2 and 3 show a montage of the optical spectra of SN 2005gj obtained from\nOctober 2005 to March 2006. We have split them in two figures to avoid crowding. The\nposition of the most conspicuous spectral features have been indicated in this figure.\n\n4.\n\nX-ray Observation\n\nSN 2005gj was observed under Director's Discretionary Time for 49.5 ks on 2005 Dec\n11/12 (ObsID 7241) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Advanced CCD Imaging Spec-\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ntrometer (ACIS). The data were taken in timed-exposure mode with an integration time of\n3.2 s per frame, and the telescope aimpoint was on the back-side illuminated S3 chip. The\ndata were telemetered to the ground in \"very faint\" mode.\nData reduction was performed using the CIAO 3.3 software provided by the Chandra Xray Center1 . The data were reprocessed using the CALDB 3.2.2 set of calibration files (gain\nmaps, quantum efficiency, quantum efficiency uniformity, effective area) including a new bad\npixel list made with the acis run hotpix tool. The reprocessing was done without including\nthe pixel randomization that is added during standard processing. This omission slightly\nimproves the point spread function. The data were filtered using the standard ASCA grades\n(0, 2, 3, 4, and 6) and excluding both bad pixels and software-flagged cosmic ray events.\nIntervals of strong background flaring were searched for, but none were found.\nAbsolute Chandra astrometry is typically good to \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 5, and we sought to improve it\nby registering the Chandra image with an SDSS image. Chandra point sources were found\nusing the wavdetect tool, and their positions were refined using ACIS Extract version 3.101.\nFourteen X-ray sources had SDSS counterparts, which we used to shift the Chandra frame\nby a small amount (0.\u2032\u2032 15 in RA and 0.\u2032\u2032 07 in DEC). After the shift, the residual differences\nbetween the Chandra and SDSS sources had rms values of 0.\u2032\u2032 19 in RA and 0.\u2032\u2032 12 in DEC.\nWe extracted counts in the 0.5\u20138 keV bandpass from the position of the supernova using\na standard extraction region (\u223c1\u2032\u2032 radius), and we constructed response files with the CAIO\ntools and ACIS Extract. The background region is a source-free annulus centered on the\nposition of the supernova with inner and outer radii of 6\u2032\u2032 and 32\u2032\u2032 . Based on the 300 photons\ndetected in this region, we expect 0.3 background counts in our source extraction region.\nWe detect only two counts from the location of the supernova, but neither may be\nassociated with the supernova itself. The counts had energies of 4.0 keV and 6.5 keV, but\none would expect some emission in the 0.5\u20132.5 keV range since this is where Chandra has\nthe most collecting area. For example, the average effective area in each of the 0.5\u20132.5 keV,\n4.0\u20136.0 keV, and 6.0\u20138.0 keV bands is 470 cm2 , 270 cm2 , and 90 cm2 , respectively.\nWe calculate our upper limits using the Bayesian method of Kraft et al. (1991). For the\n0.5\u20134 keV band, the 68% (95.5%) upper limit to the source counts is 1.14 (3.05). For the\n0.5\u20138 keV band, the 68% (95.5%) upper limit is 3.52 (6.14).\nSince no Type Ia supernova has been conclusively detected in X-ray, we have no a priori\nexpectation of the spectral shape. We therefore adopt a simple absorbed power law with a\nphoton index of 2 and an absorbing column of nH = 7.08 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . For this choice of\n1\n\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nspectrum, the count rate to flux conversion is 5.2 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg/count in the 0.5\u20134 keV band\nand 6.9 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg/count in the 0.5\u20138 keV band.\nWe therefore arrive at 68% (95.5%) upper limits on the X-ray luminosity of 1.1 (2.9) \u00d7\n10 erg s\u22121 in the 0.5\u20134 keV band and 4.3 (7.6) \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 in the 0.5\u20138 keV band. Based\non the above statements concerning the Chandra effective area, we feel the 0.5\u20134 keV limit\nis a more appropriate limit.\n39\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nResults\n\nOptical light curves and colors\n\nFigure 4 shows the early SDSS and MDM ugriz light curves combined with the late time\ncoverage given by CSP u\u2032 g \u2032r \u2032 i\u2032 Y JHKs photometry. They give excellent multi-wavelength\noptical and NIR coverage and sampling of the first \u223c150 days after discovery (\u223c140 restframe days after the time of explosion).\nIn Table 5 we give important parameters derived from the light curves. We have a good\nestimate of the time of explosion of the SN at JD 2,453,637.93\u00b12.02 (September 24.4 UT,\n2005) calculated as the average time between the epoch when the supernova is detected at\n> 5\u03c3 in all filters at JD 2,453,639.94, and the last pre-discovery observation of the field\nat JD 2,453,635.91. The times and observed magnitudes at maximum in different filters\nare presented in Table 5. They are calculated from a high order polynomial fit to each\nlight curve. To estimate the errors we assume a gaussian distribution for the magnitude\nuncertainty at each epoch and filter (assuming they are not correlated from epoch to epoch),\nthen we draw randomly \u223c1000 simulated light curves and fit each one with the same high\norder polynomial. The 1\u03c3 uncertainties are taken as the rms deviation of the mean values\ncalculated from each simulated light curve.\nThe risetimes, defined as the time between explosion and maximum light, become longer\nat redder wavelengths. They are 13.5, 19.7, 33.7, and 46.9 days in ugri filters, respectively,\nwhich correspond to 12.7, 18.5, 31.7, and 44.2 days in the rest-frame of the supernova.\nWe also give in Table 5 the rest-frame magnitudes at maximum in different filters. They\nhave been corrected by Galactic extinction in the line of sight, using E(B \u2212 V )Gal = 0.121\n(SFD: Schlegel et al. 1998) and the Cardelli et al. (1989) (CCM) reddening law assuming\nRV = 3.1, and K-corrections (see below), which are not negligible in this object since it is at\nredshift z \u223c 0.062. We assume that the host galaxy extinction is negligible (Aldering et al.\n2006).\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nK-corrections have been calculated from the multi-epoch spectra presented in \u00a7 3. In\norder to estimate accurate K-corrections we need good spectrophotometric calibration in all\nthe wavelength range. Figure 5 shows the differences between the observed g \u2212r photometric\ncolors obtained from the light curves and the synthetic colors calculated directly from the\nspectra, as a function of the observed photometric colors. We use an 8th order polynomial\nfit of the light curves to obtain the observed g \u2212 r color at the epoch of a given spectrum to\nbetter than \u223c 0.03 mag. We can see that most of the spectra have good spectrophotometric\ncalibration in the wavelength range of g , r filters (3800\u20137000 \u00c5), with a residual color of\n\u223c0.05 mag rms (difference between observed and synthetic colors), but there are some obvious outliers. To correct the spectra and produce a better spectrophotometric calibration\nconsistent with the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) obtained from broadband\nphotometry we warp the spectra multiplying by a smooth function to match the observed colors, a technique commonly used for calculating K-corrections in Type Ia SN (Nugent et al.\n2002).\nFirst, we extrapolate the continuum in the blue and red sides of each spectrum presented\nin \u00a7 3 with a low order polynomial to have complete coverage of the SDSS ugriz filters\n(2000\u201311000 \u00c5). Using this extended version of the spectra we apply the CCM reddening\nlaw iteratively until the synthetic g \u2212 r color matches the observed color in each spectrum.\nThis procedure does not ensure that the calibration is good in the complete wavelength\nrange; therefore we multiply by a smooth spline with knots at the effective wavelength of\nthe SDSS filters until the synthetic u \u2212 g, g \u2212 r, r \u2212 i and i \u2212 z colors match the observed\ncolors obtained, again by using polynomial interpolation of the light curves.\nThe K-corrections for the same filter (Hamuy et al. 1993) calculated from the modified,\nspectrophotometrically calibrated spectra using SDSS passbands are listed in Table 7. The\nK-corrections are probably accurate to \u00b10.05 mag for g and r filters, and to \u00b10.1 mag for\nu, i and z where we had to extrapolate the spectra. However, our estimate is not precise\nand we can not exclude the possibility of even larger errors. After fitting with a low order\npolynomial we use the results to transform the observed SDSS magnitudes in Table 2 to the\nrest-frame.\nWe corrected the CSP u\u2032 g \u2032r \u2032 i\u2032 magnitudes to rest-frame SDSS ugri magnitudes using\ncross-filter K-corrections according to the prescription of Nugent et al. (2002). These take\ninto account the difference between the CSP and SDSS passbands convolved by the SED of\nSN 2005gj and allow us to put all the rest-frame magnitudes in the same system. We find\nthat the differences between the same- and cross-filter K-corrections are small (. 0.03 mag)\nat all epochs.\nFigure 6 shows the evolution of the rest-frame colors of SN 2005gj as a function of time\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nafter explosion. We have corrected the magnitudes by K-corrections and Galactic extinction\nin the line of sight. As a comparison we also plot the color evolution of the overluminous\nType Ia SN 1991T, a typical Type IIn SN 1999el (Di Carlo et al. 2002) (both obtained\nfrom spectral templates of P. Nugent 2 ), and two previous cases that are thought to be\nType Ia explosions in a very dense environment: SN 2002ic and SN 1997cy. For SN 2002ic\nwe use the published BV I photometry (Hamuy et al. 2003) corrected by Galactic extinction\n(E(B \u2212V ) = 0.06; SFD). We calculate cross-filter K-corrections using the calibrated spectra\nof SN 2005gj to transform observed magnitudes of the SN at z = 0.0667 (Kotak et al. 2004)\nto rest-frame SDSS magnitudes: B \u2192 u, V \u2192 g, I \u2192 i. The time of explosion of SN 2002ic\nis assumed to at \u2248JD 2,452,581.5 (2002, Nov. 3 UT; Deng et al. 2004). We obtain restframe colors in the SDSS system for SN 1997cy (Germany et al. 2000; Turatto et al. 2000) by\ntransforming the K-corrected V RI magnitudes in Germany et al. (2000) to gri magnitudes\nusing S-corrections calculated directly from spectra of SN 1997cy available online in the\nSUSPECT database 3 . We supplement this with synthetic colors from the spectra. We also\ncorrect by Galactic extinction in the line of sight (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.02; SFD) and assume the\ntime of explosion of SN 1997cy to be JD 2,450,582.5 (1997, May. 14 UT; Germany et al.\n2000), which is very uncertain, since it is taken as the time of detection of the gammaray burst GRB 970514, which may not have been associated with the SN. Magnitudes for\nSN 2002ic and SN 1997cy are not corrected by extinction in their host galaxies, which is\nunknown.\nInitially the evolution in rest-frame u \u2212 g and g \u2212 r colors of SN 2005gj, up to \u223c3040 days after explosion (\u223c10-20 days after maximum for a SN Ia), is roughly consistent with\nthe colors of SN 1991T but \u223c 0.2 mag redder in g \u2212 r, and evolves to redder colors at later\ntimes. SN 1991T reaches its maximum colors of (u \u2212 g)=1.5 mag and (g \u2212 r)=1.0 mag at\n\u223c50 days (30 days after maximum), and after that it enters the nebular phase and becomes\nbluer. At late times the u \u2212 g color of SN 2005gj has a slow linear increase and becomes\nsystematically redder than SN 1991T at > 70 days, while the g \u2212 r color stays approximately\nflat at (g \u2212 r)=0.5 mag (and bluer than SN 1991T) between 60 \u2212 110 days. The evolution\nin u \u2212 g color of SN 2002ic is very similar and consistent with SN 2005gj. SN 1997cy has a\nsimilar color evolution but it is \u223c0.2 mag bluer in g \u2212r color between 60\u2212100 days. However,\nGermany et al. (2000) give K-correction errors of \u223c0.15 mag and we have further applied\nS-corrections, therefore this does not imply a significant difference between SN 1997cy and\nthe other two Type Ia/IIn supernovae.\n2\n\nhttp://supernova.lbl.gov/\u223cnugent/nugent templates.html\n\n3\n\nhttp://suspect.nhn.ou.edu/\u223csuspect/\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe rest-frame r \u2212 i and i \u2212 z color evolution of SN 2005gj is very different from\nSN 1991T and closely follows the evolution of a SN IIn. The r \u2212 i colors of SN 1997cy are\nalso consistent with SN 2005gj. From these comparisons it is clear that the colors, a proxy\nfor the temperature of the photosphere, of SN 2005gj and two earlier cases of SN Ia strongly\ninteracting with their circumstellar medium are dominated by the radiation coming from the\nejecta-CSM interaction.\nIn Figure 7 we present the ugri light curves of SN 2005gj in absolute magnitudes. We\nalso show the light curves of SN 1991T, SN 2002ic and SN 1997cy obtained from the literature\nand corrected to SDSS rest-frame magnitudes as explained above.\nSN 2005gj has peak ugriz absolute magnitudes in the range \u221220.0 to \u221220.3 mag, this is\n\u223c 0.7\u22121.4 mag brighter than the overluminous Type Ia SN 1991T. The u light curve is consistent with a linear decline after peak luminosity at a constant rate of 0.027\u00b10.001 mag day\u22121 .\nThe g light curve has a \u223c 20 day plateau with roughly constant luminosity after maximum\n(20 \u2212 40 days after explosion), then the light curve declines linearly between 40 \u2212 100 days at\n0.018 \u00b1 0.001 mag day\u22121 and continues its linear decay at later times, but with a shallower\nslope of 0.007 \u00b1 0.002 mag day\u22121 . The r and i light curves have a similar plateau shape between 20\u221260 days and a constant linear decay at later times of 0.013\u00b10.001 mag day\u22121 . The\nchange in slope observed in the g-band at late times is less clear in ri, but still present. The\nsecondary maximum present in ri light curves of SN 1991T and other SN Ia is completely\nabsent in SN 2005gj.\nThe light curves of SN 2002ic are fainter than SN 2005gj at all times by 0.3 \u2212 0.6 mag\ndepending on the filter (0.3 \u2212 0.8 mag brighter than SN 1991T at peak). The initial decline\nrates from maximum of the u and g light curves of SN 2002ic are intermediate between\nthose of SN 1991T and SN 2005gj until around 40 days after explosion; after day 50 when\nthe ejecta-CSM interaction had become dominant in SN 2002ic (Hamuy et al. 2003), they\nclosely resemble the decline rates of SN 2005gj in the same bands. The i band light curve\nof SN 2002ic showed definite evidence for a weak secondary maximum, which is again intermediate in morphology between the strong secondary maximum observed in SN 1991T, and\nthe absence of such a feature in SN 2005gj. The gr light curves of SN 1997cy are consistent with linear decay of \u223c 0.008 mag day\u22121 , being \u223c 0.4 mag brighter than SN 2005gj at\n150 days. Unfortunately, the light curves of SN 1997cy start at \u223c 60 days after explosion\nand there is no information near peak to compare with the luminosities of SN 2005gj and\nSN 2002ic. However, if we extrapolate the gr light curves to the time of peak luminosity we\nfind that the absolute magnitudes at maximum of SN 1997cy would be within \u223c 0.2 mag of\nSN 2005gj. This has to be taken with caution because of the extrapolation and uncertain\ntime of explosion of SN 1997cy.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nNIR light curves\n\nWe used the CSP JHKs photometry obtained between 59-166 days after the explosion\n(rest-frame) to construct the absolute magnitude light curves of SN 2005gj. The observed\nmagnitudes were corrected by Galactic reddening in the line of sight (AJ = 0.108, AH =\n0.070, and AKs = 0.044 mag) and K-corrections. We calculated K-corrections for the same\nfilter using the spectral templates of P. Nugent for the Type IIn SN 1999el (which are derived\nfrom black-body curve fits to the photometry), because as we showed in \u00a7 5.1 the synthetic\ncolors obtained from the spectral templates approximate reasonably well the evolution of\nthe redder optical colors of SN 2005gj (i.e., r \u2212 i and i \u2212 z). The values of the K-corrections\nare consistent with being constant in this time range: KJ \u2248 \u22120.12 mag ,KH \u2248 \u22120.14 mag,\nKKs \u2248 0.16 mag.\nThe JHKs absolute magnitude light curves of SN 2005gj are presented in Figure 8.\nFor comparison we show the NIR light curves of a normal Type Ia obtained from synthetic\nphotometry of spectral templates and the Type IIn SN 1999el (Di Carlo et al. 2002). The\nType Ia light curves have been shifted in magnitudes to match the mean absolute magnitude\nat maximum of SN Ia (Krisciunas et al. 2004). SN 2005gj is 1.7 \u2212 3 mag brighter than a\nnormal SN Ia and SN IIn at 60 days after the explosion and declines in a slower fashion at\nlater times. A linear decay is a good fit in all NIR bandpasses at this late times (> 60 days\nafter explosion), with decline rates of \u223c 0.014 mag day\u22121 in J, \u223c 0.013 mag day\u22121 in H,\nand \u223c 0.011 mag day\u22121 in Ks . These values are similar to the decline rates in the optical ri\nbands.\nSince there are no template images of the host galaxy obtained in the NIR bands, the\nlight curves are preliminary and the analysis has to be taken with caution.\n\n5.3.\n\nBolometric light curve\n\nThe SDSS and CSP magnitudes were used to produce a quasi-bolometric light curve\nof SN 2005gj covering the optical wavelength range from 3000 \u2212 10, 000 \u00c5(u \u2192 z). We\ncorrected the magnitudes by Galactic extinction in the line of sight and K-corrections to\nobtain magnitudes in the rest-frame ugriz filters (see \u00a7 5.1 for details). We applied small\ncorrections to transform the magnitudes based in the SDSS photometric system into the\nAB system obtained from the SDSS website 4 . The AB magnitudes derived in this way\nare transformed directly to bandpass averaged fluxes using the definition of the AB system\n4\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr5/algorithms/fluxcal.html.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n(Oke & Gunn 1983) and they are assigned to the frequencies that correspond to the effective\nwavelengths of the SDSS ugriz filters, calculated from the filters using the definition in\nFukugita et al. (1996): 3567, 4735, 6195, 7510, and 8977 \u00c5. We use the trapezoidal rule\nto obtain the integrated flux from u to z, this is between \u03bb1 = 3340 \u00c5 and \u03bb2 = 9596 \u00c5,\nwhere the limits of the wavelength coverage are obtained from \u03bb1 = \u03bbef f,u \u2212 \u2206\u03bbu /2 and\n\u03bb2 = \u03bbef f,z + \u2206\u03bbz /2. We extrapolate linearly the u and z light curves at late times to fill\nin the lack of coverage of the SDSS in z, and CSP in u and z bands, including the MDM\nz-band data at these epochs. The integrated fluxes are converted to luminosity assuming\na luminosity distance to SN 2005gj of 268.5 Mpc and a spherically symmetric distribution\nof the output energy. We present the integrated, quasi-bolometric luminosities from u to i\n(L(u\u2192i) ) and from u to z (L(u\u2192z) ) as a function of time in Table 8.\nIn order to estimate bolometric UVOIR luminosities we calculate time dependent bolometric corrections to include the energy output of the SN at wavelengths bluer than u-band\n(\u03bb < 3340 \u00c5) and redder than z-band (\u03bb > 9596 \u00c5). We find that black-body distributions\nwith different temperatures are a reasonable approximation of the spectral energy distribution of SN 2005gj. We use \u03c72 -minimization to fit the optical SED with a two parameter\nblack-body function: temperature and a multiplicative scaling factor. The scaling factor is a\ncombination of fundamental constants and the square of the angular radius of the spherical\nblack-body: (Rbb /d)2 , where Rbb is the radius of the black-body and d is the distance to\nthe SN. We calculate time-dependent bolometric corrections by integrating the black-body\ndistributions in the ultraviolet and NIR/IR regions, and converting the integrated fluxes to\nluminosities as explained above. For the CSP data we also include NIR flux densities derived\nfrom the reddening and K-corrected Y JHKs magnitudes after fitting the light curves with\nlow order polynomials.\nAt early phases before peak the bolometric corrections account for \u223c 53 \u2212 65% of the\ntotal integrated luminosity, of which 85 \u2212 93% is from the ultraviolet part of the spectrum\nand only 7 \u2212 15% from the NIR/IR. As the supernova evolves, the ejecta expands and\nshocks the circumstellar gas. The energy emitted in the ultraviolet/blue part of the spectrum declines quickly after maximum light and most of the energy is emitted in the optical\nregion, coinciding with the appearance in the spectrum of emission/absorption features of\nthe intermediate and iron-peak elements (see \u00a7 5.4). Between 25 \u2212 150 days after explosion\nthe bolometric corrections account for \u223c 32 \u2212 45% of the total output luminosity, with the\nNIR/IR correction dominating completely over the blue/ultraviolet at > 60 days.\nThe bolometric UVOIR luminosities, black-body temperatures and radii derived from\nthe fits are presented in Table 8. The uncertainties in black-body temperatures and radii are\ncalculated using the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix obtained from the \u03c72 minimiza-\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ntion. We add a 10% error in the distance to the SN to the error in the black-body radii, which\ncomes from the random and systematic uncertainties in the value of the Hubble constant\n(Freedman et al. 2001; Riess et al. 2005). The uncertainties in the bolometric luminosities\nwere estimated by propagating errors through the trapezoidal integration of the SED, taking\ninto account: uncertainties in the photometry, light curve interpolation and fitting, Galactic\nextinction, K-corrections, and distance to the SN. To approximately take into\np account the\nerrors introduced by the bolometric corrections we multiplied these values by \u03c72\u03bd when the\nreduced \u03c72 is greater than 1.\nIn Figure 9 we show some examples of black-body fits to the optical SED at different\nepochs. At early times, shortly after explosion, the SED is very well fit by a hot \u223c13000 K\nblack-body. The temperature starts to decrease steadily close to the time of explosion to a\nconstant value of \u223c 6500 K at 60 days after. A black-body is still a reasonable approximation\nof the SED at later times, but the fits become poorer when emission/absorption features start\nto dominate the spectrum, which is represented in the \u03c72\u03bd of the fits (see Table 8).\nFigure 10 shows the bolometric light curve of SN 2005gj in the top panel and the evolution in temperature and radius from the black-body fits in the lower panels. The early data\nof the bolometric light curve are well fit by an exponential rise in luminosity, L(t) \u221d e0.17 t .\nThe time of maximum bolometric luminosity occurs between 6.6\u201318.8 days after explosion.\nAfter maximum, the bolometric light curve is very well approximated by an exponential\ndecay in luminosity, linear in the logarithmic scale shown in Figure 10, L(t) \u221d e\u22120.013 t\n(0.014 mag day\u22121 ). This is consistent with the exponential density distribution of the ejecta\nof Type Ia SN (Dwarkadas & Chevalier 1998), whereas the distribution of ejecta around corecollapse supernovae is better approximated by a power-law (Chevalier & Fransson 2003).\nExtrapolating the pre- and post-maximum fits we get a maximum bolometric luminosity of\nLmax\n= 5.6 \u00d7 1043 ergs\u22121 , which is \u223c3 times more luminous than the Type Ia SN 1991T\nbol\nat maximum light (Contardo et al. 2000; Stritzinger et al. 2006). Assuming a bolometric\ncorrection of 50% at maximum, we find that SN 2005gj was \u223c1.5 times more luminous than\nSN 2002ic.\n\n5.4.\n\nOptical spectroscopy\n\nIn Figure 11 we show a comparison of the spectra of SN 2005gj with spectra of SN 2002ic\nand SN 1997cy obtained at similar times after explosion. The spectra of SN 2005gj and\nSN 2002ic are very similar at all times. They are characterized by strong and broad\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nHydrogen-Balmer lines H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 in emission5 and a blue continuum at early times that\nbecomes redder and increasingly dominated by absorption/emission P-cygni profiles from\nFe-peak ions (e.g., Fe II, Fe III, Ni III, Si II, S II).\n\n5.4.1. Classification\nBenetti et al. (2006) proposed that SN 2002ic-like events are well explained by the corecollapse of a massive star in a dense medium, casting doubt in the previous classification\nof SN 2002ic as a Type Ia supernova. The authors found relatively good agreement at all\ntimes between the spectra of SN 2004aw (Taubenberger et al. 2006), a Type Ic supernova,\nand SN 2002ic.\nWe used the SuperNova IDentification code, SNID (Matheson et al. 2005; Miknaitis et al.\n2007; Blondin & Tonry 2007), to find the spectra that best match SN 2005gj at different\nepochs. SNID cross-correlates an input spectrum with a library of supernovae spectra. In\nthe library we included spectra of 5 normal SN Ia, two 1991T-like objects, two 1991bg-like\nobjects, 4 broad-lined SN Ic (or hypernovae), and 3 normal SN Ic (including SN 2004aw),\nthat were chosen to span a wide range of observed properties of SN Ia and SN Ic. In Table 9\nwe present the supernovae and the epochs of the spectra in the library. We fixed the redshift\nof SN 2005gj at z = 0.0616 and allowed for a range around the mean redshift of \u2206z = 0.02\nto find cross-correlation peaks. The Balmer lines in emission were clipped from the input\nSN 2005gj spectra to avoid spurious cross-correlation signal with library spectra that contain\nemission lines from the host galaxy.\nFigure 12 shows the spectra of SN 2005gj at four epochs and the library spectra with\nthe highest cross-correlation significance from SNID. Type Ia supernovae spectra are a better\nmatch to SN 2005gj at most epochs, with 20 of the 26 (77%) epochs having best matched a\ntype Ia spectrum (45%-91T, 45%-normal, 10%-91bg) and a similar fraction for the next-best\nmatches. The broad-lined SN Ic 1997ef and 2002ap are the best matching spectra for 6\nepochs, all of them between 26\u201346 days after explosion. We repeated the same procedure\nusing five spectra of SN 2002ic obtained between 24\u201384 days after explosion (Hamuy et al.\n2003). All the spectra of SN 2002ic are better matched with SN Ia, in contradiction with\nthe results obtained by Benetti et al. (2006).\nThe continuum of SN 2005gj is well approximated at all times by the sum of a scaled\nspectrum of the overluminous Type Ia SN 1991T, at the same epoch after explosion as\n5\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, H\u03b3 is also visible in the early spectra of SN 2005gj.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nSN 2005gj, and a fourth order polynomial. A normal SN Ia does not fit as well as SN 1991T.\nThis procedure is very similar to the fits to SN 2002ic (Hamuy et al. 2003) and SN 2005gj\n(Aldering et al. 2006) presented in previous studies. In Figure 13 we show examples of the\nspectra decomposition at four epochs. We excluded from the fit a region of \u00b1100 \u00c5 around\nthe H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines and obtained a good fit for the remainder of the spectrum.\n\n5.4.2. Balmer lines\nWe analyzed the Balmer emission features in the spectra using the sum of two Gaussian\ncomponents to model the line profiles. This decomposition gives much better fits for H\u03b1\nat all epochs than a single Gaussian and it is physically motivated (Chugai 1997a,b). The\nspectra of Type IIn SN show Balmer features with both a narrow and broad component that\ncan be explained by radiation coming from different regions of the ejecta/CSM, whether it is\ndirect emission from the shock-heated CSM (broad component) or emission from un-shocked\ngas photoionized by the SN radiation (narrow component). The H\u03b2 line is unresolved or\nonly marginally resolved for most of the spectra. Therefore a single Gaussian component was\nused to fit the line profile. We used a third order polynomial to model the local continuum\naround each line that was included in the Gaussian fits. It is important to stress that at late\ntimes there is a broad Fe II feature intrinsic to the supernova spectrum in the region of H\u03b1\n(see spectra in Figure 13) that makes the definition of the continuum less reliable and may\naffect the line measurements.\nThe results of the Gaussian fits to the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 emission features, integrated fluxes and\nFWHM, are shown in Table 10 as a function of epoch of the spectra. We have excluded the\ntwo spectra with better resolution because they show P-Cygni profiles (see below). We used\nthe flux calibrated spectra corrected to match the observed g, r magnitudes (as explained\nin \u00a7 5.1) and corrected for Galactic reddening in the line of sight. The FWHM of the\nGaussian profiles listed in Table 10 were corrected by the resolution of the spectrographs\n(from Table 6). We do not present the values when the component is unresolved. The errors\nquoted for the integrated fluxes are obtained by adding in quadrature an estimate of 10%\nerror assigned to the absolute flux calibration and the rms deviation of the Gaussian fits.\nFigure 14 shows the evolution in time of the FWHM (top left panel), H\u03b1 and H\u03b2\nluminosities (top right and bottom left panels) and the Balmer decrement (bottom right\npanel). The FWHM of H\u03b1 varies between \u223c 130 \u2212 500 km s\u22121 (narrow component) and\n\u223c 1200\u22123800 km s\u22121 (broad component), with the broad component showing a slow increase\nin time. The FWHM of H\u03b2 varies between \u223c 470 \u2212 1700 km s\u22121 and does not show evident\nevolution. The luminosities of H\u03b1-narrow and H\u03b2 lines evolve in a similar fashion, increasing\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nat early times to peak at \u223c 12 days with luminosities 6 \u2212 6.5 \u00d7 1040 ergs\u22121 , then they decay\nand stay roughly constant after 50 days. The evolution of H\u03b1-broad is similar during the first\n50 days, peaking at 1.1 \u00d71041 ergs\u22121 , but it shows an increase at later times. Compared with\nthe H\u03b1 luminosities observed in SN 2002ic, both components are \u223c 4 times more luminous.\nThe Balmer decrement, the ratio between H\u03b1 (sum of narrow and broad components)\nand H\u03b2 fluxes, stays approximately constant during the first 30 \u2212 40 days (mean = 2.5 and\nrms = 0.5) and is consistent with the theoretical value in Case B recombination of H\u03b1/H\u03b2 =\n2.86 (Osterbrock 1989). At later times it shows an steady increase, reaching H\u03b1/H\u03b2 \u223c 7\u221213\nat \u223c 80 days. In Case B recombination a Balmer decrement H\u03b1/H\u03b2 > 2.86 is usually\ninterpreted as evidence for the presence of internal extinction in the host; however, the\nlarge values observed at late times would produce an Na I D interstellar absorption doublet\neasily detectable in the spectra, which is not observed (see also Aldering et al. (2006)), and\nthe evolution in time is not expected. Aldering et al. (2006) proposed that the H level\npopulations are in Case C recombination, where the optical depth in the H\u03b1 line is high\nimplying high densities and greater importance of collisional processes. In this scenario, the\nobserved change in the Balmer decrement could indicate that collisional excitation becomes\nincreasingly important at later times (Branch et al. 1981; Turatto, et al. 1993). SN 2002ic\n(Deng et al. 2004) and other SN IIn, like SN 1988Z (Aretxaga et al. 1999) and SN 1995G\n(Pastorello et al. 2002), have also shown large values of the Balmer decrement and therefore\nmay have similar physical processes affecting the formation of the Balmer lines.\nIn Figure 15 we show the regions around H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 features in the best resolution\nspectra from ISIS and LDSS-3, obtained at 44 and 115 days after explosion, respectively. We\nclearly detect P-Cygni profiles in all these features, which indicates the presence of an outflow\nmoving at \u223c150-200 km s\u22121 ; however, these measurements are limited by the resolution of the\nspectra between \u223c130-180 km s\u22121 (FWHM). After correcting for the resolution we obtain an\noutflow velocity of 60-70 km s\u22121 . The detection of P-Cygni-like absorption rules out an H II\nregion in the line of sight that could be producing the narrow emission/absorption features;\nthe line profiles are intrinsic to the SN. Aldering et al. (2006) detected P-Cygni profiles in\nHe I, H\u03b1 and H\u03b2, in a high resolution spectrum obtained with LRIS+Keck 71 days after\nthe explosion. They derived a wind velocity of vw \u2248 60 km s\u22121 consistent with our estimate.\nKotak et al. (2004) also detected a P-Cygni profile in the a spectrum of SN 2002ic obtained\n256 days after explosion.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n5.4.3. Line identification near maximum\nWe used the parameterized resonance-scattering code SYNOW (Fisher et al. 1997; Fisher\n2000) to identify the lines in the spectra obtained near maximum light of SN 2005gj. SYNOW\nis a fast supernova spectrum-synthesis code used for direct (empirical) analysis of supernova\nspectra, mainly to identify the lines, their formation velocities and optical depths. The\ncode is based on simple assumptions: spherical symmetry, homologous expansion, a sharp\nphotosphere that emits a black-body continuous spectrum, and line formation by resonancescattering, treated in the Sobolev approximation. We have used the latest version of the\ncode that includes a Gaussian distribution of optical depths.\nFigure 16 shows the spectrum of SN 2005gj at 17 days after explosion (2 days before\ng maximum) and the best synthetic spectrum obtained with SYNOW. We also show for\ncomparison the spectrum of SN 1991T obtained at -3 days with respect to the time of\nB maximum. The spectra have been locally normalized as in Jeffery et al. (2006). The\nsynthetic spectrum has a black-body continuum temperature Tbb = 11000 K, photospheric\nvelocity vphot = 10000 km s\u22121 , and excitation temperature Texc = 10000 K. We find a\nreasonably good match with the spectrum of SN 2005gj using the following lines/multiplets:\nFe III \u03bb4404 and \u03bb5129, Si III \u03bb4561, Ni III, S II \u03bb5468 and \u03bb5633, and Si II \u03bb6355.\nThese lines are characteristic of the overluminous and spectroscopically peculiar, Type Ia\nSN 1991T around maximum light with strong Fe III features and weak S II doublet and Si II\n(Jeffery et al. 1992; Mazzali et al. 1995; Fisher et al. 1999).\nThe main discrepancy between the SYNOW modeling of SN 2005gj and SN 1991T is\nin the optical depths of the lines. The fit to SN 2005gj needs unphysically small optical\ndepths, approximately 1/10th of the values used for SN 1991T around maximum light. We\ninterpret this as an effect of the extra continuum radiation that is added by the ejecta-CSM\ninteraction, which is veiling (Branch et al. 2000) the supernova lines (e.g., Hamuy et al. 2003;\nAldering et al. 2006). This interpretation is supported by the good agreement obtained from\nfitting the spectra of SN 2005gj using a simple polynomial continuum added to the spectra\nof SN 1991T at the same epochs after explosion (see Figure 13).\n\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have presented extensive spectroscopy and optical/NIR photometry of SN 2005gj obtained by the SDSS-II and CSP supernova groups during the first \u223c150 days after explosion,\nand also an X-ray observation at 74 days that gives an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity.\nWe have shown the remarkable similarity in spectroscopic and photometric properties be-\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\ntween SN 2005gj and SN 2002ic, which is thought to be the first clear case of a thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion embedded in a dense CSM. The observational properties of SN 2005gj\nsupport this interpretation, they are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Spectroscopic evidence for a shock propagating into an Hydrogen-rich medium close\nto the site of the explosion inferred from the presence of Balmer lines with narrow\n(FWHM\u223c 200 \u2212 500 km s\u22121 ) and broad (FWHM\u223c 1500 \u2212 3000 km s\u22121 ) components\nat all times. The Balmer lines show P-Cygni profiles in the highest resolution spectra\nobtained at 44 and 115 days after explosion, these detections show the presence of a\nslow (\u223c 100 km s\u22121 ) moving outflow. Both observations support the interpretation of\nthe supernova ejecta interacting with a dense circumstellar material.\n\u2022 Spectrum evolves from a very blue continuum (13000 K black-body) similar to SN IIn\nat \u223c7 days after explosion to a redder continuum at later times with P-Cygni absorption/emission profiles. The strongest lines present around maximum are identified with\nsingly and doubly ionized iron-peak elements (especially strong Fe III, weak S II and\nSi II) and the spectra are well matched by the overluminous Type Ia SN 1991T diluted\nwith a polynomial continuum at similar times after explosion.\n\u2022 Very luminous and slowly declining bolometric light curve. The linear decay in luminosity after peak (\u223c 0.014 mag day\u22121 ) suggests an exponential density distribution of\nthe ejecta, which is consistent with the ejecta-density profiles obtained from simulations\nof SN Ia.\nThe data presented here on SN 2005gj makes the interpretation of 2002ic-like events\nas thermonuclear supernovae in a dense CSM, initially proposed by Hamuy et al. (2003),\nstronger. In contrast with Benetti et al. (2006), we find that the overall shape of the spectra\nof SN 2005gj are more consistent with spectra of SN Ia at different epochs. Specifically,\nType Ic SNe usually do not show the S II doublet at \u223c 5500 \u00c5 around maximum light; in\nfact SN 2004aw shows only two very weak notches at the wavelengths of S II near maximum\n(Taubenberger et al. 2006). This is one of the identifying features in SN Ia spectra, also\npresent in the overluminous SN 1991T (Phillips et al. 1992). In the spectrum of SN 2005gj\nobtained at 17 days (see Figure 16) we detect a weak double absorption that we identify with\nS II, that is much stronger in the spectrum of SN 2002ic around maximum light. We can\nsee on the top of Figure 11 that the spectrum of SN 2002ic obtained 24 days after explosion\nclearly shows this feature. Other conspicuous features observed in SN 2005gj and SN 2002ic\naround maximum are Fe III and Si II. These features are present in SN 1991T, but Fe III is\nnot observed and Si II is generally weaker in SN Ic.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nSN 2005gj has stronger ejecta-CSM interaction than SN 2002ic. The peak bolometric\nluminosity is \u223c 1.5 times brighter and the broad and narrow components of H\u03b1 are \u223c 4 times\nmore luminous in SN 2005gj. The fact that the SN 1991T features are weaker in SN 2005gj\ncompared with SN 2002ic at similar epochs is consistent with this interpretation, because the\nsupernova features are more diluted by the stronger continuum. The absence of evidence for\na secondary maximum in SN 2005gj, whereas the i band light curve of SN 2002ic does show\na hint of such a feature, is likewise consistent with the ejecta-CSM interaction in SN 2005gj\nhaving been stronger than in SN 2002ic.\n\n6.1.\n\nStructure of the CSM\n\nThe circumstellar interaction of core-collapse supernovae with a circumstellar medium\nhas been studied in detail in the literature (see Chevalier & Fransson (2003) for a review).\nWhen the fast moving ejecta encounters the approximately stationary CSM, a forward shock\nmoving into the CSM (also called circumstellar shock) and a reverse shock develops. The\nfast-moving shockwave implies large post-shock temperatures, therefore radiating energy in\nthe X-ray regime. The density distribution of the ejecta and the CSM can be well described\nby power-laws in radius, which leads to a set of self-similar analytical solutions for the\nevolution of the shock radius in time (Chevalier 1982). The physics of the ejecta-CSM\ninteraction in the case of thermonuclear supernovae is basically the same, the main difference\nis in the distribution of the ejected material which follows an exponential function in velocity\n(Dwarkadas & Chevalier 1998). In this case the solutions are no longer analytic. The density\nprofile of the shocked region is different in the case of exponential ejecta expanding into a\nconstant density medium, but the similarity increases for expansion into a wind profile whose\ndensity decreases as \u221d r \u22122 .\nA simple self-similar model of a SN shock expanding into a medium with a powerlaw density decline, as suggested for core-collapse SNe by Chevalier (1982), is ruled out\nfor this object by several observations: the exponential decrease in luminosity, suggesting\nan exponential ejecta density profile; the strange behavior of the broad and narrow H\u03b1\ncomponents; and the decrease in the blackbody radius at later times. Detailed calculations\nof the SN-CSM interaction would require highly detailed hydrodynamic modeling, which\nare beyond the scope of this paper. Instead herein we focus on trying to explain the basic\nfeatures of SN-CSM interaction as deduced from the observational data.\nThe initial velocity of a SN shock wave as it breaks out from the surface is at least of the\norder of 2 \u00d7 104 km s\u22121 . The broad H\u03b1 velocities that are seen in the first week or so are of\nthe order of 1500 km s\u22121 , and increase to more than twice this value after \u223c 50 days. These\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nvelocities are almost an order of magnitude smaller than expected SN blast wave velocities\nin the early stages, and a factor of few smaller even after \u223c 50 days. Furthermore, the\nSN shock velocity would be expected to gradually decrease as the shock moves outwards,\nwhereas the H\u03b1 profile actually indicates an increasing velocity after \u223c 50 days.\nFor these reasons, we suggest that the broad H\u03b1 lines do not indicate the SN velocity.\nInstead, we put forward a scenario of a shock expanding into a two-component ambient\nmedium: a low density wind in which are embedded high-density clumps. In this picture,\nthere should theoretically exist three different velocity components: a broad velocity component, which is not easily seen in this case, and is related to the velocity of the blast wave\nitself; an intermediate velocity component, which is what we have referred to as the broad\nH\u03b1 and is related to the velocity of the shock driven into the clumped material; and a\nnarrow velocity component, which may be related to the narrow H\u03b1 and is representative\nof the velocity of the ambient medium. This scenario is like the scenario put forward by\n(Chugai & Danziger 1994) to explain the origin of the broad, intermediate and narrow line\ncomponents in SN 1988Z. The large H\u03b1 luminosity of SN 2005gj at late times is very similar to that seen in other Type IIn SNe, and is especially large considering that this was\na Type Ia. However, there are significant differences. We do not see a really broad line\ncomponent representative of the SN velocity, although there are some suggestions that this\nmay be appearing at late times. In particular, the H\u03b1 profile of the spectrum obtained at\n\u223c 150 days is better fitted by three components, including a very broad component with\nFWHM \u2248 7000 kms\u22121 .\nOur scenario envisions the Type Ia SN shock wave expanding in a clumped medium\npresumably formed by mass-loss from a companion star. The broad component is not easily\nvisible in H\u03b1 initially because the forward shock is not radiative. The density of the clumps\nis much higher than that of the interclump (ambient) medium. When the SN shock wave\ninteracts with a dense cloud or clump, it drives a strong shock into the clump. A reflected\nshock is driven back into the expanding ejecta (Klein et al. 1994). Assuming pressure equilibrium, the ratio of the velocity of the clump shock to that of the blast wave is inversely\nproportional to the square-root of the ratio of the clump density to that of the interclump\nmedium. The optical emission arises from behind the clump shock, probably by reprocessing\nof the X-ray emission.\nIn this model, the intermediate component represents the velocity of the clump shock,\nwhich is probably radiative. If we assume that the initial velocity of the SN shock wave\nis \u223c 20000 km s\u22121 and the broad H\u03b1 emission velocity is \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 , then the ratio of\nvelocities is 13 \u2212 14. This indicates that the clump density is about 142 , or \u223c 200 times the\ninterclump density. Note that the optical emission, which goes as density squared, will then\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nbe 2002 times, or about 40,000 times greater compared to that from the interclump medium.\nThis is consistent with the fact that no broad line emission is seen from the interclump\nmedium. If the initial velocity is much higher, as is conceivable, the clump density could\nbe up to \u223c 50% higher, and the ratio between the emission from the dense clumps and\ninterclump medium even larger.\nWhat value of the clump density is suggested? A shock wave traveling at 1500 km s\u22121\nwould be radiative if it were expanding in a medium whose density is greater than \u223c\n106 cm\u22123 , whereas a 2500 km s\u22121 shock would require minimum densities of the order of\n107 cm\u22123 (Draine & McKee 1993) in order to be radiative. The CSM density, being two\norders of magnitude smaller, would then to be & 104 cm\u22123 . These are just minimum values,\nand it is conceivable that the actual clump density is much higher. This result is consistent\nwith the conclusion of Aldering et al. (2006).\nThe observations show that the broad H\u03b1 width increases after 50 days, suggesting\nan increase in the clump shock velocity at later times, which could perhaps be due to a\ndecrease in the clump density. Conversely, however, the luminosity of the H\u03b1 also increases,\nsuggesting an increase in the electron density. At the same time, we would expect the SN\nshock to be decreasing in velocity as it continues its outwards expansion.\nWe suggest that the way to reconcile these observations is a scenario in which the density\nwithin the clump medium starts out higher than 108 cm\u22123 , probably as high as 1010 cm\u22123 in\nthe first few days, and decreases gradually outwards. The almost constant behavior of the\nFWHM of the broad H\u03b1 suggests that the density profile of the ambient medium is flatter\nthan r \u22122 . Since we want the clump shock to be radiative even when the shock velocity\nis almost 3000 km s\u22121 , this suggest that the density at \u223c 150 days is greater than about\n107 cm\u22123 . And since the density is decreasing outwards, we infer that the density close in is\neven larger. Over the entire period of observations the clump density is large enough that\nthe shock driven into these clumps is always radiative. The density of the ambient medium\nis two orders of magnitude smaller, as discussed above. The high bolometric luminosity is\nconsistent with these values.\nFor the first \u223c 50 days the H\u03b1 emission arises only from the radiative shock driven into\nthe dense clumps. However, by \u223c 50 days the SN forward shock, which is decreasing in\nvelocity, enters the radiative regime, and the cooling shell of material begins to contribute\nto the H\u03b1 luminosity. The velocity of the SN shock is quite large, and its contribution\ninitially is not a large fraction of the total H\u03b1 luminosity. But as it expands outwards,\nits velocity decreases and the shock becomes more radiative, and the contribution to the\ntotal H\u03b1 luminosity increases, more than compensating for the decreasing density. If this\nconclusion is correct, then we would expect that a broad velocity component would be visible\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nin the H\u03b1 spectra, whose intensity would gradually increase with time even as the FWHM\ndecreases. Although the underlying supernova contamination makes it hard to isolate a\nbroad component, it is suggestive that by day \u223c 150 the spectrum is best fit by a third,\nmuch broader component of the velocity, thus providing support for this line of reasoning.\nFinally, in this model the narrow line emission arises from the unshocked slowly expanding ambient material, presumably the outflow that we find expanding at \u223c60 km s\u22121 . We\nnote that although the width of the narrow line H\u03b1 emission as listed is higher, it is still\nunresolved, and it is possible that within the limits of resolution the narrow line component\nand outflow velocity are indeed the same.\nTo summarize, in this model the Type Ia SN expands in a clumped ambient medium,\nwith the clump density about \u223c 200 times that of the surrounding medium close in to\nthe star, and decreasing as we go outwards. The H\u03b1 emission initially arises mainly from\nthe shock driven into the dense clumps. The SN shock propagating into the interclump\nmedium begins to enter the radiative regime around day 50, and its contribution to the H\u03b1\nemission gradually increases beyond that coming from the clumped medium, leading to the\ngradual rise in the H\u03b1 emission. We note that several features of this model are similar\nto the model presented by Chugai et al. (2004) for SN 2002ic, thus further supporting the\nsimilarity between the two supernovae.\nThe upper limit on the X-ray luminosity obtained at 74 days after the explosion can\nput a constrain on the mass loss rate from the precursor or companion (e.g., Immler et al.\n2006). Assuming that the X-ray luminosity is dominated by emission from the reverse shock\nwe obtain \u1e40 . 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (2\u03c3) using Equation 3.10 in Fransson et al. (1996). This\nvalue has to be taken as an approximate estimate because we are making several assumptions\nabout the physical properties of the ejecta-CSM interaction that should be calculated using\ndetailed hydrodynamical simulations: a constant velocity of the shock, Vsh \u2248 8000 km s\u22121 ;\na solar composition of the CSM material; an electron temperature at the reverse shock of\nTe = 107 K, which comes from the modeling of SN 2002ic (Nomoto et al. 2005); a flat\ndensity profile of the CSM, \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 ; and a power-law ejecta density profile with index n = 7\n(Nomoto et al. 1984).\nWe can also estimate a mass loss rate from the companion using the density of the\nambient medium (n \u223c 108 cm\u22123 ), the initial optical radius of the CSM (R \u2248 1015 cm), and\nthe velocity of the wind: \u1e40 = 4\u03c0 R2 v \u03c1, this is assuming a flat density profile for the CSM.\nWe obtain: \u1e40 \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is in agreement with the 2\u03c3 upper limit calculated\nfrom the X-ray luminosity.\nThe presence of Balmer lines in emission in the first spectrum obtained 6.6 days af-\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nter explosion shows that the ejecta started to interact with the CSM at an earlier epoch\n(Aldering et al. 2006). Extrapolating linearly to zero flux the early increase of H\u03b1 and H\u03b2\nfluxes we find that the ejecta-CSM interaction started 3 \u00b1 1 days after explosion, which\ngives an internal radius of the CSM Ri \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 1015 cm. The outer radius of the CSM\ncan be estimated assuming a constant velocity of the shock of Vsh \u2248 8000 km s\u22121 over the\nfirst year. We detect H\u03b1 in emission in a spectrum obtained at 368 days after explosion,\nwhich will be presented elsewhere, putting a lower limit on the outer radius of the CSM,\nRo & 3 \u00d7 1016 cm. This is also consistent with a Type Ia SN with an exponential ejecta\ndensity profile expanding outwards in a medium of average density & 107 cm\u22123 .\nIn the interpretation above we assume that the broad component of the Hydrogen\nBalmer lines originate in the dense clumps, while the narrow component arises from the\nphotoionized un-shocked gas. However, Thompson scattering of the lines has been considered\nas an alternative mechanism that can explain relatively well the symmetric line profiles of\nSN 2002ic (Wang et al. 2004) and SN 2005gj (Aldering et al. 2006). In this scenario, both\ncomponents would arise from a single high density region. The total mass of hydrogen in\nthe emitting region would be MH \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 (1010 /ne ) M\u2299 , where ne is the average electron\ndensity in the emitting zone, as calculated from the luminosity of the H\u03b1 line at maximum\nusing the Case B recombination coefficient. The electron density must be sufficiently high,\nne \u2248 1010 cm\u22123 , to be consistent with the line ratios of He lines observed in the spectra\n(Aldering et al. 2006), and a high electron density would explain the non-detection in X-ray\nand radio (Soderberg & Frail 2005). However, it is unlikely that this model would be able\nto explain the initial constancy and then rise of the broad H\u03b1 luminosity.\n\n6.2.\n\nRates, hosts galaxies and possible progenitors of SN 2002ic-like\nsupernovae\n\nThe SDSS-II Supernova Survey has a well understood discovery efficiency of SN Ia at\nlow redshift (z . 0.1), which allows us to obtain an accurate supernova rate measurement\ncontrolling systematic errors (Dilday et al. 2007). In the fall 2005 season there were a total\nof 16 spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia (including 1991T-like and 1991bg-like objects) at\nz < 0.12, one photometric identification, and the spectroscopically confirmed peculiar events:\nSN 2005hk (Phillips et al. 2007) and SN 2005gj. Since the detection efficiency of 2002ic-like\nobjects has not been carefully modeled, we can only put a lower limit on the fraction of these\nevents. The spectroscopic confirmation of one object at z < 0.12 puts a lower limit of 5+7\n\u22124 %\n(68% confidence) in the fraction of 2002ic-like events among SN Ia at low redshift. From the\npreviously known (2002ic) and probable events (1997cy and 1999E) the estimated fraction\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nis \u223c 1% of SN Ia discovered between 1997 and 2002, which is consistent with our limit.\nIn the fall of 2006 we obtained the spectrum of a slowly declining supernova that was\ndiscovered in 2005, but did not have a spectroscopic classification, SN 70176. To our surprise,\nthe late spectrum of SN 7017 resembles that of SN 2005gj one year after explosion and the\nearly photometry also shows similarities which lead us to classify it as the highest redshift\nSN 2002ic-like object observed to date, at z = 0.27 (Prieto et al. 2007, in preparation).\nConsidering SN 7017 in the spectroscopically confirmed sample of SN Ia during the 2005\nseason, a total of 129 SNe at z . 0.42, we have that 2/130 (1.5%) are SN 2002ic like objects,\nwhich is consistent with the low limit on the fraction at low redshift estimated before.\nHowever, this fraction has to be taken with extreme care and probably does not reflect\nthe true fraction. This is because the discovery efficiency of SN Ia declines as a function\nof redshift and the total number of spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia does not include SNe\nwith good Ia-like light curves that were not spectroscopically classified. A more careful study\nof the rates of SN 2005gj-like supernovae in the SDSS-II is planned for a future publication.\nThe host galaxies of supernovae can provide important clues about their progenitors.\nThe host of SN 2005gj is a very blue, low-luminosity dwarf (MB \u2248 \u221217), and has an irregular\nmorphology with no well defined core. Aldering et al. (2006) combined the SDSS photometry\nwith UV imaging from GALEX to construct an SED of the galaxy. They constrained the\nmetallicity to Z < 0.3 Z\u2299 , with a burst of star formation \u223c 200 Myr ago. SN 2002ic has a\nlate type (Sbc) spiral host with a well defined core. The host of SN 1997cy is also a blue, lowluminosity (MV \u2248 \u221218.2), and low surface brightness dwarf irregular galaxy (Germany et al.\n2000). GALEX has imaged the positions of SN 1997cy, 2002ic and 2005gj, and their hosts\ngalaxies are all detected in the Near-UV (NUV) band. Their absolute magnitudes in the\nNUV (AB magnitudes) are between -16.6 (SN 2005gj) and -17.3 (SN 1997cy and 2002ic).\nThey are low-luminosity late type galaxies, \u223c 1 \u2212 1.7 magnitudes fainter than L\u2217 galaxies\nobserved by GALEX at redshift z < 0.1 (Wyder et al. 2005). The host galaxy of SN 1999E is\na late spiral with a nuclear starburst first observed by the IRAS satellite (Allen et al. 1991).\nFrom 2MASS photometry, its absolute magnitude is 1 mag brighter than an L\u2217 galaxy in\nthe K-band (Kochanek et al. 2001). SN 7017 at redshift z = 0.27, has a blue, dwarf-like\nhost galaxy with absolute magnitude in B of \u221217.9.\nThe host galaxies of the five SN 2002ic-like objects known share some common properties: they are late type galaxies, irregulars and late spirals, most likely with recent star\nformation. Four of the host galaxies have low luminosities, similar to the Magellanic clouds,\n6\n\nThis is the internal name given by the SDSS-II Collaboration. It was not announced in an IAU circular\nbecause of the late spectroscopic classification.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nwhich indicates they are low metallicity systems. For example, a dwarf galaxy with intrinsic\nluminosity MB = \u221218 has an Oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.4 (van Zee et al.\n2006), which corresponds to 1/3 the solar Oxygen abundance (Delahaye & Pinsonneault\n2006). On the other hand, the host galaxy of SN 1999E has a K-band luminosity, that when\nconverted to metallicity using the luminosity-metallicity relationship derived by Salzer et al.\n(2005), makes it consistent with the solar value. The host luminosities are only an approximate indicator of their metallicities, therefore spectra of the hosts are needed to infer the\nmetallicities and star formation rates (SFRs) of these galaxies. However, it is interesting\nto note that the range of host galaxy properties of SN 2002ic-like events seem to be inconsistent with the host galaxies of GRBs associated with supernovae (Stanek et al. 2006) and\nbroad-lined type Ib/c SNe (Modjaz et al. 2007).\nType Ia supernovae are observed in all types of galaxies. There is a well established\ncorrelation between the morphology of their host galaxies and the peak luminosity of the\nSNe: brighter supernovae (1991T-like) tend to explode in late type spirals and irregulars with\nrecent star formation, while intrinsically fainter events (1991bg-like) are observed mainly in\nearly type galaxies with an old stellar population (Hamuy et al. 1995, 1996a; Branch et al.\n1996; Hamuy et al. 2000; Gallagher et al. 2005). This environmental effect and observations\nof the local supernovae rate as a function of host galaxy properties (Cappellaro et al. 1999;\nMannucci et al. 2005), motivated Scannapieco & Bildsten (2005) to parametrize the delay\ntime distribution, time between star formation and the appearance of SNe, and the rates\nwith a two-component model having a piece proportional to the SFR of the host galaxy (or\nprompt, they explode \u223c few \u00d7 108 yr after an episode of star formation), and a second piece\nproportional to the total stellar mass (delayed component, they explode on scales of a few\nGyr after the onset of star formation). The difference in age of the stellar populations of these\nsubclasses suggests that the progenitors may also be different: prompt SN Ia would come\nfrom more massive progenitors. The host galaxies of all five SN 2002ic-like events known\nare broadly consistent with the properties of the hosts of prompt SN Ia, which suggest a\nreal association given that the best studied SN IIa to date, SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj, have\nspectral characteristics similar to 1991T-like events.\nSeveral progenitors have been discussed in the literature for SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj.\nLivio & Riess (2003) proposed that SN 2002ic is a rare case of a double-degenerate binary\nsystem, a white dwarf (WD) and the core of an AGB star spiraling-in through gravitational\nwave losses, in which the explosion occurs during or immediately after the common-envelope\nphase (a few hundred to a few thousand years of duration). The difference in line strengths\nof the Balmer emission lines observed for SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj makes this scenario\nunlikely. Also, as Aldering et al. (2006) points out, in both SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj the\nmass loss stopped only a few years before explosion, which is too short compared with the\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\ntimescale for gravitational wave radiation to produce the merger of the core and the WD.\nAnother possible progenitor initially proposed by Hamuy et al. (2003) and favored by\nthe models of Chugai et al. (2004), is the explosion of the Chandrasekhar-mass CarbonOxygen core of a massive AGB star in a degenerate medium, a supernova Type 1.5 (Iben & Renzini\n1983), where the dense Hydrogen-rich CSM would come from the outer layers of the AGB.\nIn order for the core to grow to the Chandrasekhar mass, the radiatively driven winds from\nthe AGB have to be weak enough, a condition that is only met in a very low-metallicity\nenvironment like the Galactic halo (Zijlstra 2004). At face value, the range of host galaxy\nmetallicities for SN 2002ic-like events inferred from the luminosity-metallicity relation does\nnot support the SN 1.5 scenario, although admittedly these are average metallicities and do\nnot tell us the actual range of metallicities of the progenitors.\nHan & Podsiadlowski (2006) proposed that SN 2002ic could be produced through the\n\"super-soft channel\", the most common single-degenerate model for the progenitors of SN Ia.\nIn this scenario the white dwarf is accreting material from a main sequence, or slightly\nevolved, relatively massive companion (\u223c 3 M\u2299 ) and experiences a delayed dynamical instability that leads to a large amount of mass-loss from the system in the last few \u00d7 104 yr\nbefore the explosion. Aldering et al. (2006) notes that the estimated main-sequence mass of\nthe progenitor of SN 2005gj of \u223c 2 M\u2299 , calculated using the age of the starburst of its host\ngalaxy, is consistent with the Han & Podsiadlowski (2006) model. Also, the predicted fraction of SN Ia that would be produced through the \"delayed dynamical\" channel is 0.1-1%,\nconsistent with the limits we have obtain from the detection of SN 2005gj in the SDSS-II\nSurvey.\nIn general terms, the progenitor model proposed by Han & Podsiadlowski (2006) successfully reproduces the observational properties of SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj. However, it\nis still very early in the study of this new sub-class of SN Ia. It would be interesting to\nsee in the near future the results of theoretical modeling exploring other single degenerate\nconfigurations (e.g., AGB donor) and detailed hydrodynamical modeling of the ejecta-CSM\ninteraction of SN 2005gj using the observations of the early photometric and spectroscopic\nevolution presented in this work.\n\nWe are grateful for the assistance of the staffs at the many observatories (APO, MDM,\nLCO, ESO, La Palma) where data for this paper were obtained.

North is up and east is to the left. Sixteen comparison stars in common\nbetween SDSS and CSP used to derive differential photometry of the SN are labeled as in\nTable 1. The SN is close to the center of the field.\n\n\f\u2013 49 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Spectra of SN 2005gj obtained from Oct. 1 (\u223c7 days after explosion) to Nov. 28\n(\u223c61 days after explosion) of 2005. The sequence show the dramatic spectral evolution of\nthe SN from a very blue continuum with strong Hydrogen-Balmer lines in emission in the\nearly phases, resembling the spectrum of a Type IIn SN, to a Type Ia supernova-dominated\ncontinuum with broad absorption and emission features (P-cygni profiles) of blended Fe II\nand Fe III profiles. The spectra are shown in logarithmic flux scale and a constant shift\nhas been applied for clarity. The wavelength is in the rest-frame corrected using z = 0.0616\nfor the host galaxy. We show the UT date when the spectra were obtained and the epoch\n(rest-frame days after explosion) in parenthesis.\n\n\f\u2013 50 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Late time spectra of SN 2005gj obtained between Dec. 8, 2005 (\u223c71 days after\nexplosion) and Mar. 6, 2006 (\u223c152 days after explosion). The labels, axis and symbols are\nthe same as in Figure 2. The earth symbol shows the position of a telluric feature present in\nsome of the spectra.\n\n\f\u2013 51 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Observed light curves of SN 2005gj from SDSS (open circles), MDM (open squares)\nand CSP/Swope (filled triangles).

For comparison we also\nshow the color evolution of the overluminous Type Ia SN 1991T (solid line), the Type IIn\nSN 1999el (dashed line), and two previous cases of Type Ia strongly interacting with its\ncircumstellar medium, SN 2002ic (stars) and SN 1997cy (triangles).\n\n\f\u2013 54 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Absolute ugri light curves of SN 2005gj (filled circles). For comparison we also\nshow the absolute light curves of the overluminous Type Ia SN 1991T (solid line), SN 2002ic\n(stars) and SN 1997cy (triangles). The error bar in the lower right pannel represents the\ntypical error in the absolute magnitudes dominated by a 10% uncertainty in the Hubble\nconstant.\n\n\f\u2013 55 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Absolute light curves of SN 2005gj in the NIR: J (top panel), H (middle panel)\nand Ks (bottom panel). For comparison we also show the absolute light curves of a normal\nType Ia (solid line) and the Type IIn SN 1999el (open triangles). The error bar in the lower\nright of each panel represents the typical error in the absolute magnitudes dominated by a\n10% uncertainty in the Hubble constant.\n\n\f\u2013 56 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Examples of black-body fits (solid line) to the SED of SN 2005gj obtained by transforming the rest-frame ugriz magnitudes to monochromatic fluxes at the effective wavelength\nof the filters (filled circles). These examples show the quality (i.e., goodness-of-fit) range of\nthe black body fits at different epochs: \u03c72\u03bd =0.3 (left panel), 2.4 (middle), 4.4 (right). The\nunits of flux density in the y-axis are mJy = 10\u221226 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 .\n\n\f\u2013 57 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Top panel: Quasi-bolometric (open circles) and bolometric light curves of\nSN 2005gj (filled circles). The bolometric light luminosities were obtained after applying\nbolometric corrections calculated from black-body fits to the optical SED obtained from the\nugriz photometry. The dashed line shows the best-fit linear decay of 0.014 mag day\u22121 . The\nmiddle and bottom panels show the evolution of the black-body temperature and radius,\nrespectively.\n\n\f\u2013 58 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- Comparison of spectra of SN 2005gj at 26, 46, 62 and 83 days after explosion\nwith comparable epoch spectra of SN 2002ic (Hamuy et al. 2003) and SN 1997cy (from\nSUSPECT database). The spectra are plotted on a logarithmic flux scale and shifted by an\narbitrary constant. The wavelength was shifted to the restframe using z = 0.0616 of the\nhost galaxy (Aldering et al. 2006).\n\n\f\u2013 59 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Results of SNID. We show the spectra of SN 2005gj at four epochs (26, 37, 61, and\n85 days after explosion) and their best three cross-correlation library spectra. The spectra\nare plotted on a logarithmic flux scale and shifted by an arbitrary constant.\n\n\f\u2013 60 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Fits to the spectra of SN 2005gj. We model the spectra as the sum of two\ncomponents: (1) SN 1991T spectrum at the same epoch after explosion as SN 2005gj scaled\nby an arbitrary constant (blue line); (2) fourth order polynomial (green line). The results of\nthe fits are in red and the spectra of SN 2005gj, corrected by Galactic extinction in the line\nof sight are in black. The epochs of the spectra are shown in the upper right of each panel.\n\n\f\u2013 61 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- Results from the Gaussian fits to H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 emission features as a function\nof time.

The features show clear P-cygni profiles with weak absorption minima at \u223c\n\u2212200 kms\u22121 , demonstrating the presence of a slowly moving outflow.\n\n\f\u2013 63 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- Identification of lines in the spectrum of SN 2005gj obtained at 17 days after\nexplosion (2 days before g maximum). The red line shows the best fit synthetic spectrum\ngenerated with the SYNOW code. The lines of SN 2005gj are typical of SN 1991T around\nmaximum light (blue line), and very similar to the spectrum of SN 2002ic around maximum\n(green line). All the spectra have been locally normalized. We have subtracted a constant\nvalue to the spectra of SN 2002ic and SN 1991T for clarity.\n\n\f"}
