We give an example of a non-compact, locally compact\ngroup G such that its Fourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra B(G) is operator amenable. Furthermore, we characterize those G for which A\u2217 (G)-the spine\nof B(G) as introduced by M. Ilie and the second named author-is operator amenable and show that A\u2217 (G) is operator weakly amenable for\neach G.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. History and context. Let G be a locally compact group, and let\nL1 (G) and M(G) denote its group and measure algebra, respectively. In [12],\nP. Eymard introduced the Fourier algebra A(G) and the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes\nalgebra B(G) of G. In the framework of Kac algebras [11], A(G) and L1 (G)\nas well as B(G) and M(G) can be viewed as dual to one another: this duality\ngeneralizes the well known dual group construction for abelian groups.\nIt is a now classical theorem of B. E. Johnson [20] that L1 (G) is amenable if\nand only if G is an amenable group. On the other hand, A(G) is an amenable\nBanach algebra only if G has an abelian subgroup of finite index [15, 29].\nIn order to obtain the appropriate statement dual to Johnson's theorem,\nwe first need to recognize that L1 (G)-as the predual of the von Neumann\nalgebra L\u221e (G)-is canonically equipped with an operator space structure.\nIn [27], Z.-J. Ruan modified Johnson's notion of Banach algebraic amenability from [20] by considering only completely bounded module actions and\nderivations and obtained the notion of operator amenability. Since L\u221e (G)\nis abelian, the canonical operator space structure of L1 (G) is max L1 (G),\nso all bounded maps from L1 (G) are automatically completely bounded;\nconsequently, L1 (G) is operator amenable if and only if it is amenable. As\nthe predual of the group von Neumann algebra VN(G), the Fourier algebra A(G) also carries a natural operator space structure, and in [27], Ruan\nshowed that A(G) is operator amenable if and only if G is amenable. We\nfurther note that Johnson [21] proved that L1 (G) is always weakly amenable\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

On the other hand,\nA(G) is always operator weakly amenable [33, 31, 32].\nThe questions for which G the measure algebra M(G) is amenable or\nweakly amenable, respectively, were eventually settled by H. G. Dales, F.\nGhahramani and A. Ya. Helemskii [7]: M(G) is amenable if and only if\nG is discrete and amenable, and it is weakly amenable if and only if G\nis discrete. In abelian group duality-and more generally in Kac algebra\ntheory-, the property dual to discreteness is compactness. Thus, parallel\nto the L1 (G)-A(G) situation, one is led to expect that B(G) is operator\n(weakly) amenable if and only if G is compact, as was conjectured in both\n[30] and [33] (see also [17, Problem 9]). In fact, it was shown in [30] that\nB(G) is operator amenable with operator amenability constant C < 5 if and\nonly if G is compact. At the time [30] was written, the authors felt that the\ncondition imposed on the amenability constant was unnecessary.\nIn the present article, we refute our previous conjecture by exhibiting\nexamples of non-compact groups G for which B(G) is operator amenable.\nMoreover, we show that the operator amenability constant of B(G) for those\nG is precisely 5: this shows that the estimate for this constant from [30]\ncannot be improved. All of our examples, which are taken from work by\nL. Bagget [3] and G. Mauceri and M. A. Picardello [26], are separable Fell\ngroups with countable dual spaces.\nThe groups G for which B(G) is amenable were characterized in [15]: they\nare precisely those compact G with an abelian subgroup of finite index.\nIn analogy with the corresponding result for M(G), one might conjecture\nthat B(G) is weakly amenable exactly when G is compact with an abelian\nconnected component of the identity. Our examples show that that this\nnatural conjecture is false too.\nFurthermore, we establish some amenability results for the spine A\u2217 (G)\nof B(G), which was introduced and studied by M. Ilie and the second-named\nauthor in [18].\nAcknowledgment. The second author is pleased to acknowledge a stimulating discussion he had with Zhiguo Hu, about the role played by Fell\ngroups in generating counterexamples to natural conjectures about B(G).\n1.2. Definitions and notation. The Fourier and Fourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra, A(G) and B(G), of a locally compact group G were introduced in [12].\nthe Fourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra B(G) is the space of all coefficient functions\nof weakly operator continuous unitary representations on Hilbert spaces,\ni.e., B(G) = {G \u220b s 7\u2192 h\u03c0(s)\u03be|\u03b7i : (\u03c0, H) \u2208 \u03a3G , \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 H}, where \u03a3G\ndenotes the class of such representations. Using direct sums and tensor\nproducts of representations, it can be verified that B(G) is an algebra of\nfunctions. Moreover, B(G) is the dual space of the enveloping C\u2217 -algebra\nof G, and under this norm is, in fact, a Banach algebra. The left regular\nrepresentation (\u03bb, L2 (G)) is defined through left translation on the space of\n\n\fOPERATOR AMENABILITY OF B(G)\n\n3\n\nsquare integrable functions with respect to left Haar measure. The Fourier\nalgebra A(G) is the space of all coefficients of \u03bb, and is a closed ideal in\nB(G). Moreover, B(G) is the predual of the enveloping von Neumann algebra, W\u2217 (G), and A(G) is the predual of the group von Neumann algebra,\nVN(G) := \u03bb(G)\u2032\u2032 .\nIn its capacity as the predual of W\u2217 (G), B(G) is an operator space by [4].\nOur standard reference for operator spaces and completely bounded maps\nis [10]. Taking the adjoint of the multiplication map m0 : B(G) \u2297 B(G) \u2192\nB(G), one obtains a \u2217 -homomorphism-and thus a complete contraction-\nm\u22170 : W\u2217 (G) \u2192 W\u2217 (G)\u2297W\u2217 (G), where \u2297 denotes the von Neumann tensor product. Consequently, m0 extends to a complete contraction m :\nb\nb stands for the operator space projective\nB(G)\u2297B(G)\n\u2192 B(G), where \u2297\ntensor product [5, 9]. All in all, B(G) a completely contractive Banach algebra. It is clear that every closed subalgebra of B(G)-such as A(G)-is\nb\nalso a completely contractive Banach algebra. Note that that B(G)\u2297B(G)\nis canonically completely isometrically isomorphic to a closed subspace of\n\u223c\nb\nB(G\u00d7G), and that A(G)\u2297A(G)\n= A(G\u00d7G) holds completely isometrically\nisomorphically [9].\nIf A is a completely contractive Banach algebra, a completely bounded\nA-bimodule is an operator space V, which is a module for which the module\nmaps A \u00d7 V \u220b (a, v) 7\u2192 a*v and V \u00d7 A \u220b (v, a) 7\u2192 v*a extend to completely\nb \u2192 V and V \u2297A\nb \u2192 A. Dual modules of completely\nbounded maps A\u2297V\nbounded A-bimodules with the dual space operator space structure and\nthe dual action are also completely bounded A-bimodules. A completely\ncontractive Banach algebra A is said to be operator amenable if, for every\ncompletely bounded A-bimodule V, every completely bounded derivation\nD : A \u2192 V \u2217 is inner.\nThe concept of a bounded approximate diagonal can be readily adapted\nfrom the Banach algebra context [19] to the operator space setting: a completely contractive Banach algebra is amenable if, and only if, it admits a\nb\ncompletely bounded approximate diagonal, i.e., a bounded net (d\u03b1 )\u03b1 in A\u2297A\nfor which\n\u03b1\n\na*d\u03b1 \u2212 d\u03b1 *a \u2212\u2192 0\n\nand\n\n\u03b1\n\nm(d\u03b1 )a \u2212\u2192 a\n\nfor each a \u2208 A, where a*(b \u2297 c) = (ab) \u2297 c and (b \u2297 c)*a = b \u2297 (ca) for\nb \u2192 A is the multiplication map. We say that A\nb, c \u2208 A, and m : A\u2297A\nhas operator amenability constant C, or is C-operator amenable, if C is the\nlargest number for which lim sup\u03b1 kd\u03b1 k \u2265 C for any completely bounded\napproximate diagonal. (This notion is again adapted from the corresponding notion for Banach algebras, which was developed in [22] specifically to\naddress non-amenability of Fourier algebras for certain compact groups.)\nFollowing [2], we say that a (completely contractive) commutative Banach algebra A is (operator) weakly amenable if every (completely) bounded\nderivation D : A \u2192 V into a (completely) bounded symmetric bimodule-\ni.e., satisfying a*v = v*a for a \u2208 A and v \u2208 V-is zero.\n\n\f4\n\nVOLKER RUNDE AND NICO SPRONK\n\n2. Some operator amenable Fourier-Stieltjes algebras\nFor any prime number p, let Qp denote the field of p-adic numbers, which\nis a locally compact field. It is defined to be the completion of the rational numbers Q by the p-adic valuation | * |p , which is a multiplicative,\nnon-Archimedian valuation, i.e., satisfies |rs|p = |r|p |s|p and |r + s|p \u2264\nmax{|r|p , |s|p } for r, s \u2208 Qp . We then let Op := {r \u2208 Qp : |r|p \u2264 1}, the\np-adic integers, which is a compact open subring of Qp . The multiplicative\ngroup of Op is Tp := {r \u2208 Qp : |r|p = 1}. The family of sets {pk Op }\u221e\np=0\nforms a basis of neighborhoods of 0, so that Qp is totally disconnected.\nLet GL(n, Op ) denote the multiplicative group of n\u00d7n matrices with entries in Op and determinant of valuation 1. This compact group acts on the\nvector space Qnp by matrix multiplication, and we set\nGp,n := GL(n, Op ) \u22c9 Qnp .\nFor n = 1, this is the group Tp \u22c9 Qp of [3]. It is reasonable to call Gp,n the\n\"nth rigid p-adic motion group\".\nIn [26], it was shown-using the \"Mackey machine\"-that the dual space\nbp,n -the set of all (equivalence classes) of irreducible continuous unitary\nof G\nrepresentations of Gp,n -is countable. In fact each group Gp,n is of the form\nG = K \u22c9 A where\n(1) K is a compact group acting on an abelian group A, with each of\nthe groups separable, and\nb is countable and decomposes as K\nb \u25e6q \u2294 {\u03bbk }\u221e\n(2) the dual space G\nk=1\nb is the discrete dual space of K, q : G \u2192 K is the quotient\nwhere K\nmap, and each \u03bbk is a subrepresentation of the left regular representation.\nThe following was proven for Gp,1 independently in [25] and [35]. A\nproof for general Gp,n can be obtained in a similar way. For the reader's\nconvenience, we give a proof for general groups of the form G = K \u22c9 A\nsatisfying (1) and (2).\nProposition 2.1. For G = K \u22c9 A as above, B(G) = A(K)\u25e6q \u2295l1 A(G)\nholds.\nProof. Let u \u2208 B(G), so that u = h\u03c0(*)\u03be|\u03b7i for some (\u03c0, H) \u2208 \u03a3G and\n\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 H.

Hence, it follows from Proposition 2.1 that B(Gp,n ) is\ngenerated by idempotents as well.\nFrom the remarks following the proof of [2, Theorem 1.4], we thus obtain:\nCorollary 2.2. For each n \u2208 N, the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra B(Gp,n ) is\nweakly amenable.\nSince weak amenability implies operator weak amenability, Corollary 2.2\nalready shows that-contrary to what one might expect in view of [7]-there\nare non-compact, locally compact groups with an operator weakly amenable\nFourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra.\nWe shall now see that B(Gp,n ) is even operator amenable. In fact, we will\nwork again in the slightly more general setting of Proposition 2.1.\nTheorem 2.3. For G = K \u22c9 A as in Proposition 2.1, B(G) = A(K)\u25e6q \u2295l1\nA(G) is operator amenable with operator amenability constant 5.\nProof. This proof is adapted from [23, Theorem 3.1(i)].\nSince K and G = K \u22c9 A are amenable groups, it follows from (an inspection of) [27] that A(K)\u25e6q \u223c\n= A(K) and A(G) are each 1-operator amenable.\nLet (u\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208A be a norm 1 completely bounded approximate diagonal for A(G)\nand let (v\u03b2 )\u03b2\u2208B be such for A(K).

Since G is not compact, C < 5 cannot occur by [30, Theorem\n3.2]. Hence, C = 5 must hold.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.4. The operator amenability of B(G) in Theorem 2.3 can easily\nbe obtained by observing that A(G) is an operator amenable ideal in B(G)\nwith operator amenable quotient B(G)/A(G) \u223c\n= A(K) and then applying\nthe operator space analog of [28, Theorem 2.3.7]. The disadvantage in doing\nthis, however, is that it yields no information on the operator amenability\nconstant of B(G).\n\n\fOPERATOR AMENABILITY OF B(G)\n\n7\n\nRemark 2.5. In [30], we introduced, for an arbitrary locally compact group\nG, a decomposition B(G) = AF (G) \u2295l1 APIF (G), which can be interpreted\nas dual to the decomposition of M(G) into the discrete and the continuous\nmeasures. For non-discrete G, it is well known that there are continuous\nmeasures in M(G) \\ L1 (G), and we conjectured that, at least for amenable\nG, the inclusion A(G) \u2282 APIF (G) is proper unless G is compact [30, p. 681,\nRemarks (2)]. Theorem 2.3 shows that this conjecture is false.\n3. Operator amenability of the spine\n3.1. The spine of B(G). The main theorem of the previous section is actually a particular case of a more general result. The groups Gp,n are all\nnon-compact amenable groups for which A\u2217 (Gp,n ) = B(Gp,n ) holds, where\nA\u2217 (Gp,n ) is the spine of B(Gp,n ) as defined in [18]. In this section, we study\namenability properties for spines.\nWe recall the definition of the spine of a Fourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra B(G)\nof a locally compact group G below. Full details are presented in the article\n[18].\nLet Tnq (G) denote the family of all group topologies \u03c4 on G with the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022 The completion G\u03c4 of G with respect to the left uniformity generated\nby \u03c4 is a locally compact group. (This completion is unique up to\nhomeomorphic isomorphism, and it is the same completion as gained\nfrom the right uniformity.)\n\u2022 If \u03c4ap is the coarsest topology making the almost periodic compactification map \u03b7 : G \u2192 Gap continuous, then \u03c4 \u2287 \u03c4ap .\nWe call such topologies non-quotient locally precompact topologies. The family Tnq (G) is a semilattice, i.e., a commutative, idempotent semigroup, under\nthe operation (\u03c41 , \u03c42 ) 7\u2192 \u03c41 \u2228 \u03c42 , where \u03c41 \u2228 \u03c42 is the coarsest topology which\nis simultaneously finer than both \u03c41 and \u03c42 . In particular, this semilattice\nis unital with unit \u03c4ap .\nFor each \u03c4 \u2208 Tnq (G) we let \u03b7\u03c4 : G \u2192 G\u03c4 be the natural map into the\ncompletion. Then the Fourier algebra A(G\u03c4 ) is completely isometrically\nisomorphic to the subalgebra A\u03c4 (G) = A(G\u03c4 )\u25e6\u03b7\u03c4 of B(G). We have that\nA\u03c41 (G) \u2229 A\u03c42 (G) = {0} if \u03c41 6= \u03c42 and ku\u03c41 + u\u03c42 k = ku\u03c41 k + ku\u03c42 k for\nu\u03c4j \u2208 A\u03c4j (G) (j = 1, 2), in this case. The spine is then the algebra\nM\nA\u2217 (G) = l1 A\u03c4 (G),\n\u03c4 \u2208Tnq (G)\n\nwhich is graded over Tnq (G), i.e., u\u03c41 u\u03c42 \u2208 A\u03c41 \u2228\u03c42 (G) for u\u03c4j \u2208 A\u03c4j (G)\n(j = 1, 2).\nAs in [18, Section 6.2], we can calculate that Tnq (Gp,n ) = {\u03c4ap , \u03c4p,n } for\nany of the groups Gp,n , where \u03c4p,n is the given topology on Gp,n . Moreover,\nthe quotient map q : Gp,n \u2192 GL(n, Op ) is the almost periodic compactification map. Consequently, B(Gp,n ) = A\u2217 (Gp,n ) holds.\n\n\f8\n\nVOLKER RUNDE AND NICO SPRONK\n\n3.2. Operator amenability of A\u2217 (G). For our discussion of the operator\namenability of A\u2217 (G), we introduce some auxiliary notation. For any F \u2286\nTnq (G), let hF i denote the sublattice of Tnq (G) it generates, and define\nM\nA\u2217F (G) = l1 A\u03c4 (G).\n\u03c4 \u2208hF i\n\nNote that, if F \u2286 Tnq (G) is finite, then so is hF i.\nSince Tnq (G) is finite for each of the groups Gp,n , the following lemma\nextends (the qualitative part of) Theorem 2.3.\nProposition 3.1. Let G be an amenable, locally compact group, and let\nF \u2286 Tnq (G) be finite. Then A\u2217F (G) is operator amenable.\nProof. We shall prove that A\u2217F (G) is amenable by using induction on |F |.\nSuppose that |F | = 1, so that F = {\u03c4 } for some \u03c4 \u2208 Tnq (G). Since G is\namenable, so is G\u03c4 by [28, Proposition 1.2.1], which implies that A\u2217F (G) \u223c\n=\nA(G\u03c4 ) is operator amenable by [27].\nNow suppose that |F | > 1. Fix \u03c4 \u2208 F , let F \u2032 := F \\ {\u03c4 }, and set\nI\u03c4,F := A\u2217\u03c4 \u2228F \u2032 (G) + A\u03c4 (G),\nwhere \u03c4 \u2228 F \u2032 = {\u03c4 \u2228 \u03c4 \u2032 : \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 F \u2032 }. Then IF,\u03c4 is an ideal in A\u2217F (G) containing\nA\u2217\u03c4 \u2228F \u2032 (G) as an ideal. Since A\u2217\u03c4 \u2228F \u2032 (G) is operator amenable by the induction\nhypothesis, and since I\u03c4,F /A\u2217\u03c4 \u2228F \u2032 (G) is either A\u03c4 (G) or {0}, we conclude\nfrom the completely bounded analogue of [28, Theorem 2.3.10] that I\u03c4,F is\noperator amenable. Since A\u2217F (G) = A\u2217F \u2032 (G) + I\u03c4,F and A\u2217F \u2032 (G) is operator\namenable by induction hypothesis, a similar argument yields the operator\namenability of A\u2217F (G).\n\u0003\nIt is immediate from Proposition 3.1 that A\u2217 (G) is operator amenable if\nG is amenable and Tnq (G) is finite. We shall see that these are the only\nconditions under which A\u2217 (G) can be operator amenable.\nFor the the following lemma, note that, by linearity and continuity, the\nproduct of Tnq (G) extends to l1 (Tnq (G)) turning it into a Banach algebra.\nSince the canonical operator space structure of l1 (Tnq (G)) is max l1 (Tnq (G)),\nthis Banach algebra is canonically completely contractive.\nLemma 3.2. Let G be a locally compact group. Then the map\nX\n\u03a0 : A\u2217 (G) \u2192 l1 (Tnq (G)), (u\u03c4 )\u03c4 \u2208Tnq (G) 7\u2192\nu\u03c4 (e) \u03b4\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u2208Tnq (G)\n\nis a complete quotient map and an algebra homomorphism.\nL\nProof. Note that VN\u2217 (G) := l\u221e - \u03c4 \u2208Tnq (G) VN(G\u03c4 ) is the dual space of\nA\u2217 (G). For each \u03c4 \u2208 Tnq (G), let p\u03c4 \u2208 VN\u2217 (G) be the central projection\ncorresponding to the identity element of VN(G\u03c4 ).

This show that \u03a0 is\nindeed a complete quotient map.\nTo see that \u03a0 is multiplicative, let \u03c41 , \u03c42 \u2208 Tnq (G), and let u\u03c4j \u2208 A\u03c4j (G)\nfor j = 1, 2. It follows that u\u03c41 u\u03c42 \u2208 A\u03c41 \u2228\u03c42 (G) and thus\n\u03a0(u\u03c41 u\u03c42 ) = u\u03c41 (e)u\u03c42 (e)\u03b4\u03c41 \u2228\u03c42 = u\u03c41 (e) \u03b4\u03c41 u\u03c42 (e) \u03b4\u03c42 = \u03a0(u\u03c41 ) \u03a0(u\u03c42 ).\nBy linearity and continuity, this proves the multiplicativity of \u03a0.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 3.3. Let G be a locally compact group. Then A\u2217 (G) is operator\namenable if and only if G is amenable and Tnq (G) is finite.\nProof. The \"if\" part is provided by Proposition 3.1.\nFor the \"only if\" part, suppose that A\u2217 (G) is operator amenable. The\ncentral projection pG \u2208 VN\u2217 (G) corresponding to the identity operator in\nVN(G) forms a completely contractive projection onto A(G) via the predual\naction, A\u2217 (G) \u220b u 7\u2192 pG *u. Thus A(G) is a completely complemented ideal\nin A\u2217 (G) and hence is operator amenable by the completely bounded analog\nof [28, Theorem 2.3.7]. Therefore, by [27], G is amenable.\nSince A\u2217 (G) is operator amenable, so is its quotient l1 (Tnq (G)), and since\nthe canonical operator space structure of l1 (Tnq (G)) is max l1 (Tnq (G)), it\nfollows that l1 (Tnq (G)) is amenable in the purely Banach algebraic sense.\nFrom [16, Theorem 2.7], we conclude that Tnq (G) is finite.\n\u0003\nExample 3.4. Using computations from [18, Section 6], we obtain that A\u2217 (G)\nis operator amenable for G being any one of the following groups: the real\nnumbers R, the integers Z, the Euclidean motion groups M(n) = SO(n)\u22c9Rn\nfor n \u2208 N, the ax + b group, or Qp , where p is any prime. On the other\nhand, the spine fails to be operator amenable for any of the groups Rn or\nZn with n \u2265 2, for Q as a discrete group, and for any non-amenable group.\nRemark 3.5. For any locally compact group G, let B0 (G) denote the closed\nideal of B(G) consisting of functions vanishing at \u221e. For the Euclidean\nmotion groups, it is known (see, for example, the discussion on [6, p. 10])\nthat B(M(n)) = A(SO(n))\u25e6q \u2295l1 B0 (M(n)). We suspect that B0 (G) is never\noperator amenable when it is properly larger than A(G) (see [13] for situations in which this is known to be the case). This would entail that B(M(n))\ncannot be operator amenable.\nRemark 3.6. In view of Theorems 2.3 and 3.3, we a prepared to make the\nconjecture that, for a locally compact group G, the Fourier\u2013Stieltjes algebra\nB(G) is operator amenable if and only if B(G) = A\u2217 (G), G is amenable, and\nTnq (G) is finite.\nWe note:\nCorollary 3.7. Let G be a locally compact group. Then A\u2217 (G) is amenable\nif and only if G has an abelian subgroup group of finite index and Tnq (G) is\nfinite.\n\n\f10\n\nVOLKER RUNDE AND NICO SPRONK\n\nProof. If A\u2217 (G) is amenable, it is operator amenable, so that Tnq (G) must be\nfinite. Since A(G) is a complemented ideal of A\u2217 (G), it must be amenable,\ntoo. Hence, G has an abelian subgroup of finite index by [15, 29].\n\u0003\n3.3. Operator weak amenability of A\u2217 (G). In contrast to Theorem 3.3,\nwe have the following:\nProposition 3.8. Let G be a locally compact group G. Then A\u2217 (G) is\noperator weakly amenable.\nProof. Let V be an completely bounded symmetric A\u2217 (G)-bimodule, and let\nD : A\u2217 (G) \u2192 V be a completely bounded derivation. Then\nX\nD=\nD|A\u03c4 (G) .\n\u03c4 \u2208Tnq (G)\n\nholds. Since A\u03c4 (G) \u223c\n= A(G\u03c4 ) is operator weakly amenable by [33], it follows\nthat D|A\u03c4 (G) = 0 for each \u03c4 \u2208 Tnq (G) and thus D = 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.9. It is not clear at all for which locally compact groups G, the\nspine A\u2217 (G) might be weakly amenable (in the original Banach algebraic\nsense). The spine is weakly amenable for any compact group with an abelian\nconnected component of the identity by [15, Theorem 3.3] and also for any of\nthe groups Gp,n by Corollary 2.2. However, there are compact groups K for\nwhich A(K) is not weakly amenable [22]. If we let G be any discrete group\nfor which Gap admits such a group K as a quotient, then A\u2217 (G) appears not\nto be weakly amenable. Indeed, A\u03c4ap (G) \u223c\n= A(Gap ) is a quotient of A\u2217 (G).\nap\nFurthermore A(G ) contains an isometric copy of A(K). Thus, it appears\nunlikely that A(Gap ) is weakly amenable, and we conjecture the same for\nA\u2217 (G).\nReferences\n1. G.
