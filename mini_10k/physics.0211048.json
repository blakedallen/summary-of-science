Because the energy is recovered: (1) the radio-frequency\n(RF) power demand is considerably reduced (the RF-power only provides RF-regulation\nunder steady state operation) and thus the wall-plug efficiency is improved, and (2) the final\nbeam energy can be low and thus issues pertaining to high average current beam dumps\n(dump design, radiological issues,..) are relaxed [2, 3].\nThe operation of ERL-based FELs presents many beam dynamics challenges. These latter\nare principally related to energy jitter induced-instabilities [4], and to the proper longitudinal phase space manipulation, the object of the present paper. During deceleration, the\nfractional momentum spread of the beam becomes larger due to anti-damping and if not\nproperly controlled, can yield momentum spread beyond the acceptance of the downstream\nbeam-line.\nA high average power (kW-level) infrared (\u223c 5 \u03bcm) light source, the Ir-Demo, has recently\nconcluded operations at Jefferson Lab. In this facility, which has served as a proof-of-principle\nfor an FEL operated using the so-called same-cell energy-recovery (SCER) scheme, careful\nmeasurement of the longitudinal dynamics were conducted.\nIn the present paper we address the issues pertaining to the longitudinal phase space manipulations necessary in such ERL FELs. The paper is organized as followed: we discuss,\nin Section 2, general aspects of the longitudinal beam dynamics in an ERL-driven FEL and\nintroduce the energy compression scheme. In Section 3, we describe how in practice the\nlongitudinal phase space is manipulated for the specific case of the Ir-Demo FEL. The experimental characterization of this ERL light source is presented in Section 4. Finally, we\nsummarize our conclusions in Section 5.\n\n\fII.\n\nLONGITUDINAL DYNAMICS\n\nA generic ERL-driven FEL is pictured in Figure 1. The electron beam, assumed to be\nrelativistic (so that \u03b2 \u2243 1 and the momentum equals the energy), is injected in the ERL\nmain linac with an energy of \u03b3o , and rms energy spread \u03c3\u03b3o . The main linac consists of\nan RF-accelerating section providing an energy gain amplitude \u03b3rf and operating with a\nphase \u03c6rf (the phases being referenced to the maximum acceleration phase). The undulator\nis located downstream from the linac, after the beam has been compressed in a magnetic\nbunch compressor. After participating in the FEL process, the beam is recirculated and\nre-injected into the accelerating section (on the decelerating phase \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6rf ) via the so-called\nrecirculator. The recirculator has several functions:\n\n1. it bends the beam by a total angle of 360\u25e6,\n2. it provides tuning of the transport path length (to re-inject the beam into the accelerating section with the proper phase),\n3. it provides variable tuning of bunch time-energy chirp.\n\nIn the Ir-Demo, the decelerated beam is split off the main beam-line by a dipole and the\nbeam is dumped.\nThe longitudinal dynamics is given by three requirements: (1) the beam incoming energy\nneeds to be matched to the FEL resonance condition, (2) the beam must have a high peak\ncurrent at the undulator location, and (3) the recirculator should be optimized to minimize\nthe momentum spread after the deceleration so the spent beam is cleanly dumped.\n\nA.\n\nOperation of the free-electron laser\n\na. Energy gain through the RF-accelerating section: Downstream from the accelerating\nsection an electron, of coordinate s with respect to the bunch centroid, after the accelerating\n\n\fpass gains the energy:\n\u03b3U (s) = \u03b3o(s) + \u03b3rf cos(krf s + \u03c6rf ).\n\n(1)\n\n.\nwhere krf stands for the RF-field wave vector (krf = 2\u03c0/\u03bbrf , \u03bbrf being the RF-wavelength).\nThe average beam energy, h\u03b3U i, at the undulator location, is: h\u03b3U i = h\u03b3oi + \u03b3rf cos \u03c6rf\nb. The FEL resonance condition: Given the wavelength \u03bb at which the FEL must operate,\nthe electron beam energy must fulfill the resonance condition:\n\u03b3U =\n\ns\n\n\u03bbu\n(1 + K 2 /2)\n2\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bbu is the undulator period, and K the undulator parameter.\nc. The minimum bunch length condition: Since the injector cannot directly provide the\nrequired high-peak current, it is necessary to compress the electron bunch by means of magnetic compression. We characterize the compressor by its first order momentum compaction,\nC\nR56\n, defined as the linear dependence of the path length though the compressor on the frac-\n\ntional momentum offset \u03b4. Under such a linear assumption, an electron of initial coordinate\nC\n(si , \u03b4i ) is mapped to the final longitudinal position as: sf \u2243 si + R56\n\u03b4i . If we assume there\n\nis no local momentum spread, the minimum bunch length (sf = 0) is achieved when the\nincoming longitudinal position-momentum correlation satisfies the relation:\n\"\n\nd\u03b4\nds\n\n#\n\n= \u2212 R1C .\n\n(3)\n\n56\n\ns=0\n\nIn Eq. 3, we assume the fractional momentum offset is small enough that second order\ndependencies on this quantity are insignificant; i.e. we assume\n|\u03b4| \u226a |\n\nC\nR56\n|,\nC\nT566\n\n(4)\n\nC\nwhere T566\ndenotes the second order dependence of the path length in the compressor on\n\nthe fractional momentum offset. For an achromatic chicane, under the small bending angle\nC\nC\napproximation, we have [6] T566\n/R56\n\u2243 \u22123/2.\n\nEqs. 1, 2 and 3 yield the following values for the required phase and amplitude of the\naccelerating RF-section:\ntan \u03c6rf =\n\n\u03bbrf\n2\u03c0R56\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u03b3U\n,\n\u03b3U \u2212\u03b3o\n\nand\n\n(5)\n\n\f\u03b3rf =\n\nB.\n\n\u03b3U \u2212 \u03b3o\n.\ncos \u03c6rf\n\n(6)\n\nRecirculation\n\nd. Longitudinal phase space after the FEL interaction: After the electron bunch has contributed to the FEL process, an electron loses an energy of \u2206\u0393 on average and the fractional\nmomentum spread of the bunch is increased. The average energy downstream from the\nundulator is: h\u03b3U + i = h\u03b3U i \u2212 \u2206\u0393 .\ne. Longitudinal dynamics in the recirculator: As mentioned previously, the recirculator\nprovides a zeroth order optics knob: it allows one to tune the path length in such a way\nthat the beam centroid is injected in the RF-section with the phase \u03c8rf = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6rf . In\naddition, the recirculator is used to manipulate the longitudinal phase space, because it\nprovides 360\u25e6 bending and generates dispersion (to arbitrary order) which can be used to\ncontrol the linear and quadratic (and higher order) dependence of path length on fractional\nmomentum spread in the recirculator. Because the incoming momentum spread is large,\ndepending on the geometric arrangement of the bending system, a relation as in Eq. 4 may\nnot be satisfied, and hence higher order contributions to the longitudinal transfer map need\nto be included. It is necessary to expand the longitudinal map to the second order in \u03b4. Let\n.\nxU + = (x, x\u2032 ; y, y \u2032; s, \u03b4)U + = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 )U + be the coordinates of the electron at the\nundulator exit and xR , those after the recirculation, i.e. at the linac entrance. Under the\nsingle-particle-dynamics approximation, the transport from the undulator exit to the linac\nentrance can be modeled by the longitudinal map Z that is generally Taylor-expanded:\nZ\n\nxUk + \u2192 xR\nk =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2202Zk U + 1 X X \u2202 2 Zk\nU+ U+\n+\n+ O (xU + )3\nU + xi\nU+\nU + xi xj\n2 i j \u2202xi \u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n\n(7)\n\nwhich maps the k-th electron coordinate at the undulator exit to the entrance of the linac. We\nnow define the first and second order Taylor coefficient (following the transport convention) as: Rki = (\u2202Zk )/(\u2202xUi + ) and Tkij = 1/2 \u00d7 (\u2202 2 Zk )/(\u2202xUi + \u2202xUj + ). Using these definitions\nand only considering the s-coordinate we have:\nZ\n\nsU + \u2192 sR = (R55 +\n\n4\nX\n\nj=1\n\nT55j xUj + )sU + + T555 (sU + )2 + (R56 +\n\n5\nX\n\nj=1\n\nT56j xUj + )\u03b4 U + + T566 (\u03b4 U )2 + ....(8)\n\n\ff. Deceleration for energy recovery: As the beam is decelerated in the RF-section, an\nelectron of coordinate s\u2032 downstream of the recirculator will have the energy\n\u03b3D (s\u2032 ) = \u03b3R (s\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b3rf cos(krf s\u2032 + \u03c8rf ) ,\n\n(9)\n\ndownstream of the RF-section. Here \u03c8rf = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6rf and \u03b3R is the electron energy before\ndeceleration (i.e. at the recirculator exit). From this latter equation the average energy takes\nthe form: h\u03b3D i = h\u03b3o i \u2212 \u2206\u0393. The quantity of interest after deceleration is the fractional\nmomentum offset, \u03b4 D (s\u2032 ) = \u03b3D (s\u2032 )/h\u03b3D i \u2212 1;\n\u03b4 D (s\u2032 ) =\n\n\u03b3rf [(krf s\u2032 )2 /2 cos(\u03c8rf ) + krf s\u2032 sin(\u03c8rf )]\nh\u03b3U + i\n+ \u03b4 R (s\u2032 )\n, (10)\nh\u03b3U + i \u2212 \u03b3rf cos(\u03c8rf )\nh\u03b3U + i \u2212 \u03b3rf cos(\u03c8rf )\n\nwith \u03b4 R (s\u2032 ) being the fractional momentum offset upstream from the RF-section before the\nsecond pass. In Eq. 10, we have expanded the fractional momentum offset up to the second\norder in s\u2032 because the incoming bunch length, \u03c3s\u2032 , does not a priori satisfies the condition\n\u03c3s\u2032 \u226a 1/krf . Eqs. 8 and 10 suggest a mechanism for counteracting the momentum spread\ngenerated during deceleration. The method consists of setting up the recirculator in a way\nto impart both a linear and quadratic a position-energy correlation, and allowing the bunch\nto decompress before the decelerating pass. Formally one wants to match the linear and\nquadratic dependence of \u03b4 R to\n\"\n\nd\u03b4 D\nds\u2032\n\n#\n\ns\u2032 =0\n\nh\u03b3rf i\nd2 \u03b4 D\n=\u2212\nkrf sin(\u03c8rf ), and 2 \u2032\nh\u03b3U + i\nds\n\"\n\n#\n\n=\u2212\ns\u2032 =0\n\nh\u03b3rf i 2\nk cos(\u03c8rf )\n2h\u03b3U + i rf\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the latter equation insures the RF-induced curvature is canceled. The technique is\nillustrated in Figure 3. In this figure, the last row contains the longitudinal phase spaces\ndownstream from the linac after deceleration for three different choices of recirculator optics.\nPlot (A) illustrates that the phase space slope should be properly chosen, as otherwise\nexcessive energy spread results. Once the slope is properly chosen, plot (B) of this last row\nillustrates the importance of RF-induced curvature as an lower limit for momentum spread.\nIn plot (C) we show how, using the recirculator to impart a quadratic dependence of the\nfractional momentum spread on the longitudinal position upstream from the linac, allows\nthe compensation of RF-induced curvature which, in turn, greatly reduces the fractional\nmomentum spread. In this latter case the fractional momentum spread is limited by a 3rd\norder aberration (as seen by the \"S\" shape of the phase space).\n\n\fIII.\n\nEXAMPLE OF THE IR-DEMO\n\nIn the Ir-Demo (see top view in Figure 2), the electron beam, is generated by a 350 keV photoemission electron gun [7], and accelerated [8] to \u223c10 MeV by two superconducting\nradio-frequency (SRF) CEBAF-type cavities (5-cell \u03c0-mode standing-wave cavities largely\nof the same design as those in the CEBAF accelerator [9]) mounted as a pair in the so-called\n\"quarter cryounit\". The beam is then injected into the main linac which is composed of one\ncryomodule, containing 8 CEBAF-type SRF cavities. The linac can provide a net energy\ngain of approximately 37 MeV (but is operated to provide 28 MeV energy gain for the\nresults presented in this paper). The operating frequency of the RF-system is 1.497 GHz,\nso \u03bbrf \u2243 0.20026 m. This cryomodule is followed by two 4-bend achromatic chicanes that\nbypass the FEL resonator mirrors and provide longitudinal phase space manipulation. The\nfirst chicane, upstream from the undulator, serves as bunch compressor and the second\nchicane naturally decompresses the upright bunch. The undulator is located between the\ntwo chicanes. Soon after the downstream chicane the beam is recirculated, by the means\nof a recirculator with variable (linear and quadratic) momentum compaction and path\nlength, back to the entrance of the cryomodule. The path length is chosen so the second\npass bunches have the proper time of arrival: the electron bunches are on the decelerating\nphase of the radio-frequency wave. The electrons are decelerated down to 10 MeV and are\nseparated from the 48 MeV beam and dumped in the \"energy recovery dump\" by the means\nof the \"extraction chicane\".\n\nA complete description of the driver-accelerator can be found in References [2, 5]. In terms\nof the longitudinal beam dynamics, the first matching point is at the undulator location\nwhere a longitudinal waist (minimum bunch length) is required. Given the longitudinal\nphase space at the injector front-end, the SRF-linac settings must be tuned in amplitude\nand in phase for achieving the desired longitudinal phase space correlation, \u2243 d\u03b4/ds, to\nC\nmatch the momentum compaction R56\n\u2243 \u221228.8 cm of the first chicane according to Eq. 3.\n\nIn the nominal operating conditions, the aforementioned requirements result in operating\nthe linac \u03c6rf =\u221210 \u25e6 off crest for an accelerating voltage of approximately \u03b3rf me c2 =37 MeV\n\n\fto provide an FEL wavelength \u03bb \u22435 \u03bcm. Downstream from the undulator the beam-line\nconsists of (1) a magnetic chicane similar to the one upstream but which now acts as a\nbunch decompressor, and (2) a recirculation loop. The recirculation loop incorporates two\n180\n\n\u25e6\n\narcs linked by a straight line section, the \"return transport line\", which consists of six\n\nFODO cells having a 90\u25e6 betatron phase advance per cell. The arcs are based on the MITBates accelerator design [10]; they each provide a total bending angle of 180 \u25e6. They include\nfour wedge-type dipoles, each bending the beam by an angle of about \u00b128 \u25e6 alternatively,\ninstalled in pairs symmetrically around a 180 \u25e6 dipole. In addition to providing the desired\nbending, the arcs are also used to adjust the total beam path length of the recirculated\nbeam. For such purposes, the arc is instrumented with a pair of horizontal steerers located\nupstream and downstream the 180\nthe 180\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\ndipole to vary the reference orbit path length inside\n\nmagnet. This provides a path length adjustment of the order of \u00b1\u03bbrf /2 off the\n\nnominal length (\u2243 501.5 \u00d7 \u03bbrf ).\nTwo families of quadrupoles (the trim quadrupoles) and sextupoles are installed in the arc to\nprovide both linear and quadratic energy dependent path length variation that are necessary\nin the \"energy-compression\" scheme needed to properly energy recover the beam [11]. The\nquadrupoles act both on the linear and quadratic momentum compaction of the recirculator\nU +\u2192R\nU +\u2192R\n(these quantities are henceforth noted R56\nand T566\n) while the sextupoles only impact\n\nthe quadratic momentum compaction; the magnitude of the impact of these elements on the\nmomentum compaction is illustrated in Figure 4. When the quadrupoles and sextupoles\nA\n= 13.1 cm for a single\nare unexcited, the arcs are operated in a non-isochronous mode (R56\n\n180\u25e6 arc). However under nominal operation, i.e. when the FEL is operating and the linac\nis in energy recovery mode, because of the need for energy compression, the sextupoles and\nquadrupoles of one family are excited to proper values in order to provide the required\nparameters. The momentum compaction of the recirculation loop is related to those of the\nindividual components via:\nU +\u2192R\nC\nA1\nA2\nR56\n= R56\n+ R56\n+ R56\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the subscript C, A1 and A2 indicate the quantity corresponds respectively to the\n\"decompressor\" chicane, the first and second arc. Similar relations yield for the second\norder momentum compaction.\n\n\fIV.\n\nA.\n\nEXPERIMENT IN THE IR-DEMO\n\nMeasurement of the initial conditions at the undulator\n\nExperimentally, the accelerator module amplitude is set up accordingly to numerical simulation, then the phase is tuned to obtain the minimum bunch length at the undulator (i.e.\nthe highest peak current). The bunch length is monitored [12] by detecting the coherent\ntransition radiation (CTR) emitted in the backward direction as the electron bunch crosses\nan aluminum foil adjacent to the undulator. The power density radiated by a bunch of N\nelectrons is\n[\n\ndP\ndP\n]N = [\n]1 \u00d7 (N + N(N \u2212 1)|\nd\u03c9d\u03a9\nd\u03c9d\u03a9\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\ndtS(t) exp \u2212i\u03c9t|2 ) ,\n\n(13)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndP\nwhere [ d\u03c9d\u03a9\n]1 is the single electron power density. Thus since the Fourier transform of a\n\nbunch with characteristic length \u03c3s extends to frequency \u03c9 \u223c c/\u03c3s , detecting the CTR at\nfrequencies close to this frequency provides indirect information on the bunch length. An\nexample of such a measurement is presented in Figure 5.\nOnce the phase is properly tuned, the bunch length is measured by performing Michelson\ninterferometry [13, 14] of the CTR signal, since the radiation pulse emitted by the electron\nbunch mirrors the electron distribution. From the measured interferogram, one can deduce\nthe autocorrelation function and (in virtue of the Wiener Kintchine theorem) the power\nspectrum of the CTR. A logarithmic Hilbert-transform [15, 16] of the latter power spectrum\nallows one to reconstruct the electron longitudinal charge density. A typical measurement\nof an interferogram along with the subsequent calculations is shown in Figure 6. Routinely,\nthe bunch length achieved in the Ir-Demo FEL is approximately 100 \u03bcm (rms) for a bunch\ncharge of 60 pC.\nThe fractional momentum spread of the beam is deduced from a profile measured at the\nhigh dispersion point of the decompressor chicane; the three quadrupoles upstream from\nthe chicane are used to insure the betatron contribution to the beam profile is insignificant.\nIn Figure 7 we compare the fractional momentum profiles with and without operating the\nFEL (the FEL process can be turned on/off by tuning/detuning the length of the optical\n\n\fresonator). The typical rms fractional momentum spread before the FEL interaction is about\n0.4%, which grows to to 1.2% downstream from the FEL when the laser operates.\nAt the undulator location, the bunch length has been minimized, the longitudinal phase\nspace is thus expected to be up-right; i.e. no position-energy correlation exists.\n\nB.\n\nExperimental setup to measure longitudinal transfer maps\n\nThe measurements of the longitudinal transfer map Z is very difficult. Instead, we perform a\nperturbative measurement which provides information on the Taylor expansion of the map.\nThe technique consists of perturbing the initial conditions at a given location i (initial RFphase, \u03c6i = 2\u03c0si /\u03bbrf , or initial energy \u03b4 i ) and measuring the relative time-of-flight (TOF)\nto a downstream position f (the time-of-flight is also measured in RF-phase units). The two\naforementioned excitations allow the perturbative measurement of the \u2202sf /\u2202si or \u2202sf /\u2202\u03b4 i\nexpansions of the map which gives (see Eq. 8):\nX f \u2192i\n\u2202sf\nf \u2192i i\nf \u2192i\ns and,\nT55j xj + 2T555\n= R55\n+\ni\n\u2202s\nj\n\n(14)\n\nX f \u2192i\n\u2202sf\nf \u2192i i\nf \u2192i\nT56j xj + 2T566\n\u03b4.\n=\nR\n+\n56\ni\n\u2202\u03b4\nj\n\n(15)\n\nHenceforth we will term \u2202sf /\u2202si and \u2202sf /\u2202\u03b4 i respectively as \"compression efficiency\" and\n\"momentum compaction\" maps, and we will instead work in RF-phase unit: \u2202sf /\u2202si \u2192\n\u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03c6i and \u2202sf /\u2202\u03b4 i \u2192 \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03b4 i . In essence, the measurement of the compression efficiency\nor momentum compaction maps reduces to a relative TOF variation measurement.\nMeasurement of TOF is performed by detecting the phase of a signal produced by the\nTM010 waves excited as the electron bunches traverse a resonant 1.497 GHz stainless steel\ncavity [17, 19? ]. The principle of the TOF measurement is to measure the phase of the\nbeam induced voltage since it has constant phase with respect to the electron bunches. The\nphase of the rf signal coming from the cavity is mixed with the reference signal, which may be\nphase shifted by means of a programmable phase shifter. The mixer output, after removal of\n\n\fhigh frequency component with a low pass filter, is calibrated by performing a procedure that\nconsists of varying the phase shifter to find the output maxima from the mixer. Once the\nmeasurement is calibrated, the phase shifter phase is set so that for the nominal conditions\nof the machine the cavity is operated at zero-crossing of the mixer. Thus a change in TOF\ngive rise to a linear change in the mixer output.\nThe change in the TOF induced by perturbing the beam initial phase or energy condition\nupstream can provide \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03c6i or \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03b4 i respectively. In the Ir-Demo the former kind\nof measurement is performed by varying the phase of the photo-cathode drive laser (with\nrespect to the RF-master oscillator) whereas the latter type of measurement is done by\nmodulating the gradient of the last SRF-cavity of the cryomodule. In the accelerator three\npickup cavities have been installed. Their locations are downstream of: (1) the crymomdule\n(C1), the (2) first 180\n\n\u25e6\n\n(C2) and (3) second 180\n\n\u25e6\n\narc (C3). To expedite the measurements,\n\nthe quantity varied (i.e. laser phase for \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03c6i transfer map and cavity gradient for \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03b4 i\ntransfer map), is varied at 70 Hz during the acquisition of measurement data.\n\nC.\n\nNumerical model for calculation of longitudinal transfer map\n\nThe measurement of the compression efficiency map provides important information on the\nperformance of the bunching process and can give some insights on the bunch length. Because the map is measured between the photocathode and the pickup cavities, it cannot be\nsimulated using standard single particle dynamics codes, but needs to be computed using\na particle tracking code, e.g. parmela [20], which includes non relativistic effects such as\nphase slippage effects in accelerating cavities. The technique we have used to compare the\nmeasurements with numerical simulations is as follows: we use parmela to generate uniform\nmacroparticles distribution over a given extent in RF-phase (or time) at the photocathode\nsurface. The corresponding phase of emission \u03c6ik of the k-th macroparticle at the photocathode surface is recorded and the macroparticles populating this uniform distribution are\ntracked along the beam-line. For the tracking the space charge subroutine is not activated,\nand each macroparticle is assumed to be the bunch centroid of bunches emitted at different\ndrive-laser phase, we then compute the phase of arrival \u03c6fk at the desired pickup cavities. The\n\n\fcouple ({\u03c6ik , \u03c6fk }k=1,...,N ) directly gives the phase-phase transfer map which can be compared\nto the experimental data.\nIn order to generate energy-phase transfer maps, we use the arbitrarily high order code\nTLie [21] based on a symplectic integrator: the energy offsets achieved when modulating\nthe gradient of the last cryomodule cavity are directly used by the code to calculate the TOF\nup to the desired the pickup cavity. The couple ({\u03b4ki , \u03c6fk }k=1,...,N ) provides the energy-phase\ncorrelation and again can be compared with the data.\n\nD.\n\nPath length adjustment\n\nIn passing we note that one of the installed detectors can also be used to precisely setup the\npath length of the recirculator; in such a case the detector C1 is used. The beam is first\ndumped in the \"straight ahead dump\" (see Fig. 2) and the phase of the reference signal used\nfor C1 is shifted so that the signal at the mixer output is maximized. The beam is then\nrecirculated and the path length is varied using the dedicated horizontal steerers located\nat both entrance and exit of the two 180\u25e6 bends. The path length is optimized when the\nsignal measured at C1 is zeroed: this corresponds to the case when the beam induced voltage\ngenerated by the first pass and recirculated beams exactly cancel.\n\nE.\n\nExperiments and simulations\n\nThe compression efficiency and momentum compaction transfer map measurement have been\nextensively used during the commissioning of the Ir-Demo, to verify our model, but also in\nroutine operation, to insure the accelerator, and especially the recirculator loop, is properly\nset up.\n\n\f1.\n\nCompression efficiency\n\nIn Figure 8, we compare a typical measurements of the \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202\u03c6i maps at the three different\ndetectors (C1, C2, and C3) with the maps generated via simulations.\n\nWe generally\n\nobserve a good agreement with between the measurement and the expectations. The slight\ndisagreement, e.g. as the one observed at detector C3, is attributed to mis-steering in the\narc 2 which makes larger the contribution of the T55j terms (with j = 1, ..., 4) in Eq. 14.\nThe second arc transport is more vulnerable to such misalignments since the bunch length\nis larger compared to arc 1.\n\nMore quantitative information can be obtained by performing a nonlinear fit of the transfer\nmap presented in the Figure. This can give some insight on the linear R55 and quadratic,\nT555 compression efficiency coefficients between the photocathode and the pickup cavities:\nthe results are presented in Table I.\n\nThe compression efficiency map measurement was also used as a trouble shooting tool.\nIn Figure 11 we present a series of measurement we performed using the detector C2: the\ncompression efficiency was measured for three settings of one of the quadrupole pairs of arc 1:\n(a) the quadrupoles are excited to their nominal values, (b) they are turned off, and (c) they\nare powered to a value opposite to case (a). The comparison of the measured transfer map\nwith the simulated one shows some disagreement (at that time we could not accurately know\nprecisely the machine settings of the upstream beam-line, e.g., in the injector). However, if\none compares the difference measurement (i.e. calculated as (b)-(a) and (b)-(c)) with the\ncorresponding difference simulations, the agreement becomes very good. Such an example\nillustrates how a measurement of transfer maps for various perturbations of the lattice (here\nusing quadrupole pairs) can be used to verify that the different lattice elements that compose\nthe beam-line perform as expected. This method was in fact used to diagnose a reinjection\nphase error during commissioning [23].\n\n\f2.\n\nMomentum compaction:\n\nThe momentum compaction transfer map was measured by modulating the gradient of the\nlast cryomodule cavity by \u00b11%.\n\nThe linear expansion of the transfer map, R56 , was measured at both C2 and C3. In\nFigure 10, we compare the expected evolution of the linear momentum compaction for\ndifferent excitations of the \"trim quadrupoles\" with the measurement obtained at C2 and\nC3: the agreement is excellent. A more quantitative measurement was performed using\nC2, the momentum compaction from the cryomodule exit up to C2 was measured as a\nfunction of the trim quadrupole settings, the comparison of such a measurement with the\nexpected values obtained with the second order optics code dimad [22], again the good\nagreement confirms the usefulness of time-of-flight diagnostics for setting up the recirculation.\n\nThe sensitivity of the momentum compaction map to second order changes in the optics, e.g.\nimparted by the sextupoles, was also investigated. Figure 12 depicts the impact of exciting\none of the sextupole pairs of arc 2 on the map measured by the detector C3. The effect\nobserved in simulations and measurements is the same: in both cases exciting the sextupole\nimpress a positive curvature on the map \u2013 though the agreement is not absolute. This can\nagain be explained by the sensitivity of the nonlinear terms to mis-steering via the second\norder chromatic functions T56i (with i = 1, ..., 4). Especially when the FEL is operating, the\naforementioned effect is enhanced because of the large FEL-induced fractional momentum\nspread.\n\n3.\n\nOther experimental evidence of energy compression:\n\nThe primary evidence of the good performance of the energy compression scheme was\nour ability to recover 5 mA average current beam while lasing at high gain with an\naverage output power of 2.1 kW without any beam losses. The Ir-Demo is equipped with a\n\n\fhigh sensitivity protection system that can detect localized losses of beam as low as 1 \u03bcA [24].\n\nAnother validation of the method is to observe the beam transverse density on the energy\nrecovery dump aluminum window. Such a measurement was performed by detecting the\nbackward optical transition radiation (OTR) emitted at the interface vacuum/aluminum of\nthe window. The OTR images are detected with a charge couple device (CCD) camera and\ndigitized for analysis. At the window the dispersion (horizontal) is \u03b7 \u2243 1 m. The results of\nour observations are presented in Figure 13: when the longitudinal compression is properly\ntuned the beam is tightly focused whereas by slightly mis-setting one pair of sextupoles\n(which does not affect \u2212 to first order \u2212 the lattice functions), the beam horizontal size\nstarts to blow-up, indicating relatively poor energy spread.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have successfully characterized the energy compression scheme to recover the \"spent\"\nelectron beam after the FEL-process in the IR-demo. Such techniques are well adapted for\nenergy-recovering an electron beam in a moderate power FEL. For very high power FELs\nanticipated in the future, higher order corrections and/or the use of a dedicated \"accelerating\" section to impart the required position energy correlation might be needed. As an\nexample the forthcoming upgrade of the Ir-Demo to 10 kW requires the use of octupoles [25].\n\nThe techniques we have developed for characterizing the longitudinal lattice maps have\nproven to be a valuable tool both during the commissioning of the Ir-Demo FEL but also\nfor its day-to-day operation: under the nominal setup of the recirculator the map pattern is\nwell defined and changes of this pattern indicate one of the component in the recirculator or\nRF-system is not properly set. However there is room for improvement: we have shown that\nin some cases, e.g. due to mis-steering of the beam in the arcs, the extraction of quantitative\ninformation from the transfer map may turn out to be difficult. A way of improving this\nsituation is to measure the transfer map for different steering conditions. By doing such a\n\n\f\"two dimensional difference orbit\" measurement, one could get information on the coupling\nterms (e.g. T55j or T56j ) and thus correct accordingly the measurement to be less sensitive\nto misalignment.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was sponsored by US-DOE grant number DE-AC05-84ER40150, the Office of\nNaval Research, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Laser Processing Consortium.\n\n[1] Tigner M., Nuovo Cimento 37, 1228-1231 (1965)\n[2] Douglas D.R., Proc.
