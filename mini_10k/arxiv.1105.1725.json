In fact, several spectroscopic methods rely on the opportunity to chose a well\ndefined polarization state of the light. Spin [1] and angular resolved photo-electron spectroscopy, x-ray linear and\ncircular dichroism or resonant scattering of polarized xrays [2, 3] are only few examples. For this reason, light\npolarization-dependent spectroscopy using standard synchrotron radiation has become a very powerful tool to\nstudy the electronic and magnetic properties of matter\n[4, 5].\nThanks to a dramatic increase of photon peakbrilliance with respect to conventional sources, as well\nas to the possibility of controlling both the temporal duration and the spectral bandwidth of the produced light\npulses, free-electron lasers (FELs) will allow completely\nnew studies in the above mentioned research fields [6].\nSuch studies will also take advantage of well-defined and\neasily tunable light polarization. For the preparation\nof the scientific case of single-pass FELs, a fundamental question concerns the possibility of generating significant photon flux at higher harmonics of the fundamental\nwavelength, while maintaining polarization ductility.\nIn a FEL, harmonic generation is driven by the\nelectron-beam interaction with a radiation at a given\nfundamental wavelength, in the presence of the static\nand periodic magnetic field generated by an undulator\n[7\u201314]. Such interaction produces a significant modulation (called bunching) of the electron-beam density at the\n\nfundamental wavelength, and its harmonics. Harmonic\nbunching is the (nonlinear) source of FEL harmonic emission. The latter is orders of magnitudes stronger than the\nspontaneous incoherent emission and provides the possibility to extend the FEL tuning range towards short\nwavelengths.\nIn the simplest possible configuration, FEL harmonics\nare produced in the same undulator where radiation at\nthe fundamental wavelength is generated. This method\nis the standard one when the FEL light is obtained from\nSelf Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) [15], and\nis normally referred to as nonlinear harmonic generation\n(NHG).\nAn alternative approach to NHG for producing coherent harmonic emission relies upon the bunching created\nin an undulator, called the modulator, for generating coherent emission in a subsequent undulator, called the radiator, tuned at one of the harmonics of the modulator\n[16, 17]. This technique is usually called coherent harmonic generation (CHG). The implementation of CHG\nrequires the use of an external coherent source, acting as\na \"seed\", which is normally provided by one of the harmonics of a Ti: sapphire laser. These harmonics can be\nproduced either using a solid-state crystal, or a gas jet\n[18]. The seed-electron interaction in the modulator is\nnecessary to initiate the bunching process. Bunching is\nproduced at all (odd and even) harmonics. As a consequence, in the radiator, coherent emission may occur at\nany selected harmonics, no matter the radiator polarization. The situation changes when NHG is considered. It\nis well known that, in case of planar undulators, on-axis\nNHG occurs only at odd harmonics, while even harmonics are present only off-axis [7]. In [19] it has been experimentally demonstrated that, as in the case of spontaneous emission, the NHG signal generated by helical undulators is distributed off-axis. A quantitative estimate\nof the off-axis coherent harmonic flux is, however, still\nmissing. This lack of information is due to the absence,\n\n\f2\n~e\n~\ntric field envelope E\n\u22a5 = \u0112\u22a5 exp [\u2212i\u03c9z/c] does not vary\nmuch along z on the scale of the reduced wavelength\n\u03bb = \u03bb/(2\u03c0).

Recently,\nan analytical model has been proposed [20\u201323], relying\non the paraxial solution of Maxwell's equations. Such\na model confirms what has been found in [19], i.e. no\non-axis NHG in helical undulators, and provide a quantitative prediction of the far-field angular harmonic distribution.\nIn this paper, we perform a first quantitative experimental analysis of the angular distribution of FEL harmonic radiation generated by a helical undulator. In particular, we characterize the off-axis emission in NHG configuration. Obtained results are used to benchmark the\ntheoretical model proposed in [20\u201323].\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section II we\nbriefly review the theoretical model and discuss the angular characteristics of the predicted far-field harmonic\ndistribution. In Section III we present the experimental device we used to perform the measurements, i.e. the\nFEL installed at the Elettra storage-ring [25, 26]. In Section IV, experimental data are presented and compared\nto theoretical predictions. Finally, in Section V we draw\nconclusions and provide perspectives for future work.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe coherent emission in the far zone from modulated\nelectron beams in planar or helical undulators can be\nstudied by solving the paraxial Maxwell's equation for\nthe electric field in the space-frequency domain [20\u201323].\nLet us call the transverse electric field in the space~ (z, ~r , \u03c9), where, as shown in Fig.\nfrequency domain \u0112\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n1, ~r\u22a5 = x~ex + y~ey identifies a point on a transverse plane\nat longitudinal position z, ~ex and ~ey being unit vectors\nin the transverse x and y directions.\nThe paraxial approximation is well suited for modelling the emission from ultra-relativistic electrons (see\n[21, 22]). It relies on the assumption that the elec-\n\n(1)\n\n(where c is the speed of light in vacuum). The right\nhand side is determined by the trajectory of the source\nelectrons, and is written in terms of the Fourier transform\nof the transverse current density, ~j\u0304\u22a5 (z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c9), and of the\ncharge density, \u03c1\u0304(z, ~r\u22a5 , \u03c9), which will be considered as\ngiven macroscopic quantities. The Fourier transform of\nthe charge density can be written as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nso (z)\n\u2032\n~\n\u03c1\u0304 = \u2212e\n\u03c1(z, ~r\u22a5 \u2212 r o\u22a5 (z), \u03c9) exp i\u03c9\n,\nvo\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the minus sign on the right hand side is introduced for notational convenience. In the latter expression, the quantities r~\u2032 o\u22a5 (z), so (z) and vo are, respectively, the transverse position, the curvilinear abscissa\nand speed of a reference electron with Lorentz factor \u03b3\nthat is injected on axis with no deflection and is guided\nby the undulator field. Such electron follows a trajectory\n\u2032\n\u2032\nr~\u2032 o\u22a5 (z) = rox\n~ex + roy\n~ey , which assumes different forms,\nnamely:\nK\n[(cos(kw z) \u2212 1)~ex + sin(kw z)~ey ] (3)\nr~\u2032 o\u22a5 (z) =\n\u03b3kw\nif the electron propagates through a helical undulator and\nK\nr~\u2032 o\u22a5 (z) =\n(cos(kw z) \u2212 1)~ex\n\u03b3kw\n\n(4)\n\nif the undulator is planar. Here K = \u03bbw eHw /(2\u03c0me c2 )\nis the undulator parameter, \u03bbw = 2\u03c0/kw being the undulator period, e the electron charge, Hw the maximal\nmodulus of the on-axis magnetic field of the undulator,\nand me the rest mass of the electron. The corresponding\nvelocity is given by ~vo\u22a5 (z) = vox~ex + voy ~ey .\nSince we want to discuss an FEL process, \u03c1e in Eq. (2)\nis a slowly varying function of z on the wavelength scale\nand is peaked around the harmonics of the fundamental\n(i.e. at frequencies h\u03c9r = 2hkw c\u03b3\u0304z2 , \u03b3\u0304z being the average\nlongitudinal Lorentz factor, and h the harmonic number)\nwith bandwidth \u2206\u03c9/(h\u03c9r ) \u226a 1.\nMoreover, for each particle in the beam, the relative\ndeviation of the particles energy from \u03b3me c2 is small,\ni.e. (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3\u0304)/\u03b3 \u226a 1. Therefore, in first approximation, we\ncan neglect the difference between the average transverse\n\n\f3\nvelocity of electrons h~v\u22a5 i and ~vo\u22a5 , so that ~j\u0304\u22a5 \u2261 h~v\u22a5 i\u03c1\u0304 \u2243\n~vo\u22a5 \u03c1\u0304.\nFurthermore, we will be interested in the total power\nemitted and in the directivity diagram of the radiation\nin the far zone. We therefore introduce the far zone approximation calling the observation angle ~\n\u03b8 = ~r\u22a5o /zo (see\nFig.1), z0 being the distance from the middle of the undulator to the observer. We also set \u03b8 \u2261 |~\n\u03b8| and take the\nlimit for zo \u226b Lw , where Lw = Nw \u03bbw is the undulator\nlength.\nFinally, we introduce a coherent deflection angle, ~\u03b7(c) ,\nto describe the transverse deflection of the electron beam\nas a whole [30]. We therefore perform the following substitution:\nr~\u2032 o (z) \u2212\u2192 ~r(c) (z, ~\u03b7 (c) ) = r~\u2032 o (z) + ~\u03b7 (c) z .\n\n(5)\n\nIt follows that also ~vo (z) should be substituted with\n~v (z, ~\u03b7 (c) ), and that \u03b3\u0304z (z, ~\u03b7 (c) ) is now a function of both\nz and ~\u03b7(c) .

(13). For the calculation, use has been made of parameters reported in Table I, corresponding to the case of the\nElettra storage-ring FEL. In this case, light is emitted at the\nsecond harmonic of the radiator fundamental wavelength (i.e.,\nh = 2, corresponding to 260 nm), which is the third harmonic\nof the seed wavelength (780 nm).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nThe predictions of the model presented in the previous Section have been tested on the Elettra storage-ring\nFEL, whose scheme is shown in Fig. 4. The setup, which\nis based on two independent APPLE II undulators separated by a magnetic chicane, is very flexible: depending on the undulator configuration, both NHG and CHG\nschemes can be implemented. The laser pulse emitted\nby a Ti:sapphire laser (fundamental wavelength at 780\nnm) interacts with the electron bunch within the modulator, inducing an energy modulation in the electron\nbeam. After the conversion of the energy modulation\ninto spatial bunching, occurring into the magnetic chicane, the bunch enters the radiator and emits coherent\nradiation at one of the harmonics of the seed laser (the\nthird one, i.e. 260 nm, for the experiments presented in\nthis paper). The harmonic radiation is first monochromatized and then acquired on a digital oscilloscope by\nmeans of a photomultiplier tube (PMT), see Fig. 4. The\nlatter is fast enough to resolve the pulsed dynamics of the\nelectron bunch photoemission (nanonosecond scale), but\ndoes not allow to resolve the photon pulse shape (tens\nof ps). A diaphragm of 1.4 mm is placed downstream\nthe radiator, before the detector. The diaphragm is used\nto select only the portion of radiation emitted within a\nsmall cone close to the undulator axis (angular acceptance of about 100 \u03bcrad). By moving the diaphragm, it\nis possible to characterize the angular distribution of the\nproduced coherent radiation.\n\nFIG. 4: Schematic layout of the Elettra storage-ring FEL.\n\nFor the reported experiments, Elettra was operated in\nsingle-bunch mode at 0.75 GeV (\u03b3 \u2243 1468), the peak\nbunch current and its revolution period being, respectively, \u2243 10 A and 864 ns. The seed repetition rate is\n300 Hz. The laser pulse and the electron bunch duration\nare, respectively, 120 fs (rms) and about 35 ps (rms). A\nstable laser-electron synchronization with a jitter of few\nps [26] guarantees an efficient and stable seeding process,\nwith shot-to-shot fluctuations of the order of few percent.\nThe main experimental parameters, also used to obtain\nthe theoretical angular spectral flux reported in Figs. 2\nand 3, are reported in Table I. More detailed information\nabout the experimental setup, as well as about the performance of the Elettra storage-ring FEL, can be found\nin [26].\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this Section we present the experimental data and\nperform a quantitative comparison between experiments\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Main experimental parameters.\n\nA\nps\n%\n\u03bcm\n\u03bcm\n\n40\n\n6000\nCHG signal (W)\n\n10\n1468\n35\n\u2243 0.1\n0.6\n200\n10\n\n50x10\n\n30\n4000\n20\n2000\n10\n\n0\n\n\u223c 10\nGW\n780\nnm\n\u223c 120\nfs\nHoriz., Circ.\n0.10\n20\n\nm\n\n260\n\nnm\n\n3.19\n520\n\nnm\n\n4.63\nHoriz, Circ.\n\nand theory.\nA first set of measurements has been carried out in\nCHG configuration, tuning the radiator at 260 nm (third\nharmonic of the seed wavelength), in circular polarization. The intensity detected by the PMT, as a function\nof \u03b8y , is represented by the open circles in Fig. 5. As\nexpected (see Fig. 2), the intensity has a maximum in\ncorrespondence of the undulator axis (\u03b8y = 0).\nDue to some mechanical limitations intrinsic to our\ndevice, the diaphragm can be moved only downstream\nalong the vertical direction. As a consequence, no measurements have been performed along positive \u03b8y 's, nor\nalong the \u03b8x direction. Error bars represent the result of several independent measurements. Fluctuations\nare mainly due to FEL instabilities and to possible undesired slight shifts of the electron-beam trajectory in\nthe time period between successive measurements. Data\nhave been acquired at quite low average electron-beam\ncurrent (< 1 mA), that is in a regime characterized by\nrelatively long beam lifetimes (order of hours). However, since the harmonic intensity varies as the square of\nthe number of charges involved into the emission process\n[25], even small current variations may reflect in significant intensity fluctuations. In order to take this effect\ninto account, a correction factor has been applied to experimental data. In Fig. 5, continuous and dotted lines\nrepresent the theoretical predictions obtained using Eq.\n(13) and the parameters reported in Table I.

The continuous line has been\ninstead obtained by integrating the curve shown in Fig. 2\nalong \u03b8y , over an angle of 100 \u03bcrad around \u03b8x = 80 \u03bcrad.\nThe latter value corresponds to the best possible experimental accuracy in controlling the horizontal alignment\nbetween the electron beam and the undulator axis.\nThe same (experimental and theoretical) analysis has\nbeen carried out in NHG configuration. In order to reproduce as much as possible the experimental conditions\nof the CHG configuration, the radiator has been tuned at\n520 nm (in circular polarization). This avoids any seedelectron interaction inside the radiator and, as a consequence, prevents any undesired degradation of the beam\nquality (i.e., an increase of the beam energy spread).\nSince 520 nm is not a harmonic of the input seed wavelength, no bunching is produced in the modulator at such\nwavelength. As a consequence, there is no coherent emission at the fundamental wavelength of the radiator. However, one obtains coherent emission through NHG at 260\nnm and 130 nm (second and fourth harmonics, respectively, of the radiator wavelength). As for the case of\nCHG, the intensity of the coherent emission at 260 nm\nis detected using the PMT. Results are reported in Fig.\n6. As expected (see Fig. 3), due to the finite aperture\nof the diaphragm, NHG emission is not exactly zero on\naxis.\nIn order to check the agreement between measurements\n\n\f6\n300\n6000\n\n200\n4000\n150\n100\n2000\n\nDetected signal (a.u.)\n\nNHG signal (W)\n\n250\n\n50\n0\n\n0\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\u03b8y (\u03bcrad)\n\n200\n\n400\n\nFIG. 6: Intensity of NHG at 260 nm, second harmonic of the\nradiator fundamental wavelength, as a function of the angle\n\u03b8y .

In plotting experimental data, a correction factor has\nbeen used to take into account (slight) current variations occurred in the time period between successive measurements.\n\nand theory, one can compare the experimental and theoretical ratios between the peak CHG and residual NHG\non-axis intensities. Using the data reported in Figs.\n5 and 6, and considering the (more realistic) theoretical continuous curves, one gets an experimental ratio\nof about 60 and a theoretical one of 140. Taking into\naccount the above-mentioned experimental incertitude,\nas well as the approximations intrinsic to the theoretical\nmodel, the agreement can be considered satisfactory [33].\n\ncal undulators. Measurements carried out on the Elettra\nstorage-ring free-electron laser, have been compared to\nthe predictions from a model based on the analytical solution of the paraxial Maxwell equations. As we have\nshown, the agreement can be considered as satisfactory.\nThis result allows one to consider the theoretical model\nas a reliable tool for predicting the off-axis photon flux of\nnext-generation FELs, operated in Nonlinear Harmonic\nGeneration mode.\nIn fact, predictions are in general quite pessimistic.\nAs an example, calculations have been recently performed [27] for harmonic off-axis emission in the case\nof the FERMI@Elettra FEL [28], an FEL user facility\npresently under commissioning at Sincrotrone Trieste. In\nthe case of FERMI, operating at 5 nm in circular polarization, FEL saturation is easily reached and about 3*1012\non-axis photons/pulse at the fundamental wavelength are\nproduced. The flux reduction at the second (off-axis) harmonic, calculated using the theoretical model, is drastic:\nonly about 108 photons/pulse are expected at 2.5 nm.\nAn additional factor of about *104 is lost if considering\nthe third harmonic emission at 1.33 nm [27]. Having\nprovided an experimental validation of the theoretical\nmodel, we can conclude that collecting off-axis emission\ndoes not allow to recover a significant photon flux when\nthe FEL is operated in Nonlinear Harmonic Generation\nmode, with circularly polarized undulators.\nAs an alternative method to obtain significant (onaxis) circularly polarized harmonic radiation, one may\nconsider the possibility to operate the radiator in elliptically polarized mode. Such a method gave interesting\nresults in the case of spontaneous (linear) harmonic radiation [29]. As a future study, we plan to investigate its\nefficiency when applied to Nonlinear Harmonic Generation in FEL's.\n\nVI.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe performed a quantitative analysis of the angular\ndistribution of Nonlinear Harmonic Generation in heli-\n\nWe acknowledge useful discussions W.
