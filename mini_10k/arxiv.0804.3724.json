I NTRODUCTION\nGeneric properties of flows, especially of Riemannian geodesic flows, are a classical\ntopic in the theory of dynamical systems and in calculus of variations, with important\ncontributions by many authors. A well known result of the area is the so-called bumpy\nmetric theorem, originally formulated by Abraham [4], and proved in detail by Anosov\n[6], which states that the bumpy Riemannian metrics over a given compact manifold form a\ngeneric set. Recall that a metric is bumpy when all its closed geodesics are nondegenerate.\nRecently, B. White [27] has proven a nice formulation of the bumpy metric theorem in\nthe context of minimal immersions; more precisely, given a compact manifold M and a\nDate: November 27th, 2008.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57R45, 57R70, 57N75, 58E10.\nThe second author was partially supported by Regional J.

In the case M = S 1 , White's theorem does not reproduce exactly\nthe bumpy metric theorem, in that the result does not guarantee that iterates of a given\nclosed geodesic, which are not embeddings, are also nondegenerate. A key point in the\nproof of this result, which has a variational nature, is that the Jacobi differential operator\narising from the second variational formula of the area functional is a self-adjoint Fredholm\noperator. Inspired by White's result, the goal of the present paper is to initiate a study of\ngeneric properties of geodesics in semi-Riemannian manifolds, i.e., in manifolds endowed\nwith a non positive definite nondegenerate metric tensor. At the present stage, this is a\ntotally unexplored field. Motivations for the interest in such kind of dynamical systems\nare obviously related to Lorentzian geometry and General Relativity, to which this paper is\nultimately devoted, but also to Morse theory, as explained below, and to the general theory\nof semi-Riemannian manifolds. As a starting point for our theory, we consider the case\nof fixed endpoints geodesics in semi-Riemannian manifolds. We set ourself the task of\ndetermining whether the set of semi-Riemannian metrics on a fixed manifold M that:\n\u2022 have fixed index;\n\u2022 belong to some specific class, such as orthogonally split, globally hyperbolic, or\nare conformal to some given metric;\n\u2022 make any two arbitrarily fixed distinct points non conjugate along any geodesic,\nis generic. One should observe that in the non positive definite case, the Jacobi differential\noperator is not self-adjoint, or even normal, but the index form (i.e., the second variation\nof the geodesic action functional) along a given geodesic is represented by a self-adjoint\nFredholm operator. Recall that, given p, q \u2208 M , the nonconjugacy property above relatively to some semi-Riemannian metric g on M is equivalent to the fact that the g-geodesic\nR1\naction functional \u03a9p,q \u220b \u03b3 7\u2192 12 0 g(\u03b3\u0307, \u03b3\u0307) dt \u2208 R, defined on the Hilbert manifold \u03a9p,q\nof all curves of Sobolev class H 1 in M joining p and q, is a Morse function. Standard\nMorse theory does not apply to the semi-Riemannian geodesic action functional, due to\nthe fact that in the non positive definite case all its critical points have infinite Morse index. Recent developments of Morse theory, mostly due to the work of Abbondandolo and\nMajer (see [1, 2]) have shown that, under suitable assumptions, one can construct a doubly\ninfinite chain complex (Morse\u2013Witten complex) out of the critical points of a strongly indefinite Morse functional, using the dynamics of the gradient flow. The Morse relations for\nthe critical points are obtained by computing the homology of this complex, which in the\nstandard Morse theory is isomorphic to the singular homology of the base manifolds. Such\ncomputation is one of the central and highly non trivial issues of the theory. Remarkably,\nAbbondandolo and Majer have also shown that this homology is stable by \"small\" perturbations, so that in several concrete examples one can reduce its computation to a simpler\ncase. This occurs for instance in the case of the geodesic action functional in a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold, in which case the homology of the Morse\u2013Witten complex is\nstable by small C 0 perturbations of the metric. Thus, it becomes a relevant issue to discuss\nunder which circumstances a given metric tensor can be perturbed in a given class in such\na way that the nondegenericity property for its geodesics between two prescribed points is\npreserved. This problem is the original motivation for the results developed in this paper;\nwe basically give an affirmative answer to the genericity questions posed above, with three\nremarkable exceptions that will be discussed below.\nThe idea for proving the genericity of the nondegeneracy property for the critical points\nof a family of functionals, which follows a standard transversality approach (see the classical reference [5, Chapter 4], or the more recent [3, Section 2.11]), is the following. Assume\nthat one is given a Hilbert manifold Y , and a family of functionals fx : Y \u2192 R parameterized by points x in an open subset A of a Banach space X. In the geodesic case, Y is the\nHilbert manifold \u03a9p,q (M ) of curves between two fixed points in a manifold M , X is the\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n3\n\nspace of (0, 2)-symmetric tensors on M , and A is the open set of nondegenerate tensors\nhaving a fixed index. Then, one consider the set of pairs\n\b\nM = (x, y) : y is a critical point of fx ,\n\nwhich under suitable assumptions has the following important properties:\n\u2022 M is an embedded submanifold of the product X \u00d7 Y ;\n\u2022 the projection \u03a0 : M \u2192 X onto the first factor is a smooth nonlinear Fredholm\nmap of index 0;\n\u2022 the critical values of \u03a0 are precisely the set of x \u2208 A such that fx has some\ndegenerate critical point in Y .\nThus, the genericity of nondegenerate critical points is reduced to the question of regular\nvalues of a Fredholm map, to which Sard\u2013Smale theorem gives a complete answer. In order\nto make this setup working, one needs some regularity and Fredholmness assumptions,\nplus a certain transversality assumption that in the geodesic case reduces to the existence\nof some special tensors on the underlying manifold.\nThere are three cases in which the genericity property of nondegenerate geodesics either fails, or cannot be proven with the techniques of this paper. First, perturbations in a\ngiven conformal class are insufficient to eliminate degeneracies of lightlike geodesics. In\nfact, every conformal perturbation of a semi-Riemannian metric preserves lightlike pregeodesics and their conjugate points, so that nondegeneracy is not generic in a given conformal class. The second, and more intriguing, point that deserves further attention is the\ncase of geodesics with the same initial and endpoint and, more specifically, the case of\nperiodic geodesics. Note that in the case of periodic geodesics, the notion of nondegeneracy has to be modified, due to the fact that in the periodic case the tangent field to a\ngeodesic is always in the kernel of the index form. Every periodic geodesic produces a\ncountable number of distinct critical points of the action functional by iteration. In order to\ndevelop Morse theory, one clearly needs to have nondegeneracy of all this iterates, which\namounts to saying that the linearized Poincar\u00e9 map along the given geodesic should not\nhave any (complex) roots of unity in its spectrum. Due to some technical reasons, the\nmetric perturbations studied in this paper fail to produce the desired result in the case of a\n1-periodic geodesic \u03b3 some of whose iterates \u03b3 k admits a nontrivial periodic Jacobi field\nPk\nJ satisfying j=1 Jt+j = 0 for all t. Examples of this situation can be constructed easily,\nfor instance by considering periodic geodesics on a flat M\u00f6bius strip. Roughly speaking,\nPk\nthe field Vt = j=1 Jt+j indicates in which direction the metric should be stretched in\norder to destroy the degeneracy produced by the Jacobi field J. Due to this problem, all\nour genericity results use the (probably unnecessary) assumption that the endpoints should\nbe distinct. It is curious to observe that, also under this assumption, one does not avoid\nhaving to deal with portions of periodic geodesics (see Lemma 4.2), but this case is treated\nwith a little \"parity\" trick. We conjecture that most of the results of this paper should hold\nalso in the case of periodic geodesic (in the Riemannian case this is established in [4] and\n[6]), but the proof should be based on dynamical arguments, rather than variational. The\nthird situation where the transversality condition is not satisfied, and thus the genericity of\nmetrics with nondegenerate geodesics cannot be deduced by the theory in the present paper, is the case of stationary Lorentzian manifolds. We will show with an explicit example\nthat, in the class of stationary metrics on a manifold M having a prescribed vector field\nY \u2208 X(M ) as timelike Killing vector field, the transversality condition fails to hold along\na degenerate geodesic which is an integral line of Y .\nWe will now give a detailed technical description of the material discussed in the paper,\nwith a few additional remarks. In Section 2 we fix notations and discuss a few preliminary\nresults involving the functional analytical setup and the geometrical setup of the paper.\nIn the functional analytical part we determine a criterion for the surjectivity (Lemma 2.1)\nand a criterion for existence of a closed complement to the kernel (Proposition 2.3) of the\n\n\f4\n\nL. BILIOTTI, M. A. JAVALOYES, AND P. PICCIONE\n\ndirect sum of two bounded linear operators. These are used to determine transversality to\nthe zero section of a cotangent bundle for the partial derivative of a map defined on product\nspaces (Proposition 3.1). The main result of the geometrical part is Lemma 2.4, that gives\nthe existence of (global) sections of a vector bundle endowed with a connection, whose\nvalue and covariant derivative have been prescribed along a small immersed curve in the\nbase. In Section 3 we consider the abstract setup of a family of smooth functionals over a\nHilbert manifold, parameterized by points of (an open subset of) a Banach manifold. The\ncentral result, Corollary 3.4, uses a certain transversality assumption (see formula (3.1)) to\ncharacterize the Morse functionals in the family as regular values of a nonlinear Fredholm\nmap, yielding the desired genericity result via Sard\u2013Smale theorem. The main idea and\nthe proof of Corollary 3.4 follow closely B. White's arguments in the abstract setup of [27,\nSection 1]. In Section 4 we apply Corollary 3.4 to the fixed endpoint geodesic problem\nin several contexts. We will first consider (Subsections 4.1 and 4.2) the case of general\nsemi-Riemannian metrics on an arbitrarily fixed manifold, possibly non compact. When\ndealing with a non compact manifold M , there is no canonical Banach space structure on\nthe space of tensors on M , and in particular there is no way of describing semi-Riemannian\nmetric tensors as an open subset of a Banach space. Note that Sard\u2013Smale theorem uses\na Banach space structure in an essential way. One way to induce a Banach space norm\nin the space of tensors would be to use an auxiliary complete Riemannian metric gR on\nM , and then considering tensors of class C k on M whose first k (covariant) derivatives\nhave bounded gR -norm (see Example 1). However, a more general genericity statement\nis obtained by considering the notion of C k -Whitney type Banach space of tensors on M ,\nwhich is introduced in Subsection 4.1. A Banach space of tensors E is said to be of C k Whitney type if it contains all tensors of class C k with compact support (these are used in\nall our genericity results), and if its topology is finer than the weak C k -Whitney topology,\ni.e., if convergence in E implies C k -convergence on compacta. C k -Whitney type Banach\nspaces of tensors seem to provide a sufficiently general and adequate environment in which\none can prove genericity results based on Sard\u2013Smale theorem, including a large variety of\nsituations where one poses asymptotic conditions on the metric tensors. An argument by\nTaubes, pointed out to the authors by the referee, allows to extend all the genericity results\npresented in this paper to the more elegant context of the topology of C \u221e -convergence on\ncompact subsets. In Section 5 we will discuss the details of the argument.\nIn Subsection 4.3 we study the genericity property of metrics in a given conformal class.\nAs mentioned above, we restrict ourselves to the case of nondegeneracy of nonlightlike\ngeodesics between fixed endpoints. In subsection 4.4 we consider product manifolds M =\nM1 \u00d7 M2 , endowed with metric tensors that make the two factors orthogonal, and we\nprove a genericity result in this context. In Subsection 4.5 we consider globally hyperbolic\nLorentzian metric tensors; by a celebrated result of Geroch ([15]), recently improved by\nBernal and S\u00e1nchez ([8, 9]), these metrics form a subclass of the family of orthogonally\nsplit metric tensors in product manifolds M1 \u00d7 R. Finally, in Section 4.6, we will exhibit\na counterexample to the transversality condition in the stationary Lorentzian case.\n2. N OTATIONS\n\nAND\n\nP RELIMINARIES\n\n2.1. Functional analytical preliminaries. Let H be a Hilbert space with inner product\nh*, *i; given a closed subspace W \u2282 H, we will denote by PW : H \u2192 W the orthogonal\nprojection onto W .\nLemma 2.1. Let V be a Banach space, H a Hilbert space, L1 : V \u2192 H and L2 : H \u2192\nH be bounded linear operators, with Im(L2 ) closed; set L = L1 \u2295 L2 : V \u2295 H \u2192\nH, L(v, h) = L1\u0001(v) + L2 (h), v \u2208 V , h \u2208 H. Then, L is surjective if and only if\nPIm(L2 )\u22a5 Im(L1 ) = Im(L2 )\u22a5 . If in addition L2 is self-adjoint and PKer(L2 ) (Im(L1 ))\nis closed in Ker(L2 ) (this is the case, for instance, if Ker(L2 ) is finite dimensional, i.e., if\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n5\n\nL2 is Fredholm), then L is surjective if and only if for all h \u2208 Ker(L2 ) \\ {0} there exists\nv \u2208 V such that hL1 (v), hi =\n6 0.\nProof. The first statement is immediate. If L2 is self-adjoint, then Im(L2 )\u22a5 = Ker(L2 ).\nSince PKer(L2 ) (Im(L1 )) is closed, PKer(L2 ) \u25e6 L1 : V \u2192 Ker(L2 ) is not surjective if and\nonly if there exists h \u2208 Ker(L2 ) such that hPKer(L2 ) (L1 (v)), hi = hL1 (v), hi = 0 for all\nv \u2208 V . The conclusion follows.\n\u0003\nLet us recall that a closed subspace W of a Banach space V is said to be complemented\nif there exists a closed subspace W \u2032 \u2282 V such that V = W \u2295 W \u2032 ; such a space W \u2032 will\nbe called a complement of W in V .\nLemma 2.2. Let L : U \u2192 V be a linear map between vector spaces, and let S \u2282\nV be a finite codimensional\nspace. Then, L\u22121 (S) is finite\ncodimensional in U , and\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\ncodimU L (S) = codimV (S) \u2212 codimV Im(L) + S .\n\nProof. If \u03c0 : V \u2192 V /S is the projection onto the quotient, the linear map \u03c0 \u25e6 L : U \u2192\nV /S has kernel L\u22121 (S). Hence, \u03c0 \u25e6 L defines an injective linear map on the quotient\nU/L\u22121 (S) \u2192 V /S, and so:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ncodimV (S) = dim V /S = dim U/L\u22121 (S) + codimV /S Im(\u03c0 \u25e6 L)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= codimU L\u22121 (S) + codimV Im(L) + S . \u0003\n\nProposition 2.3. Let U , V , W be Banach spaces, L1 : U \u2192 W , L2 : V \u2192 W be\nbounded linear operators, and assume that Ker(L2 ) is complemented in V (this is the\ncase, for instance, if V is a Hilbert space, or if L2 is Fredholm) and that Im(L2 ) is finite\ncodimensional in W . Set L = L1 \u2295 L2 : U \u2295 V \u2192 W ; then, Ker(L) is complemented in\nU \u2295V.\n\nProof. Consider the (possibly not closed) subspace Im(L1 ) \u2282 W ; Im(L1 ) \u2229 Im(L2 ) has\nfinite codimension in Im(L1 ). Namely, if \u03c0 : W \u2192 W/Im(L2 ) is the quotient map, then\nthe restriction \u03c0|Im(L1 ) : Im(L1 ) \u2192 W/Im(L2 ) has kernel Im(L1 ) \u2229 Im(L2 ). Thus, one\n\u0002\n\u0003\nhas an injective linear map from Im(L1 )/ Im(L1 ) \u2229 Im(L\n\u0002 2 ) to the finite dimensional\n\u0003\nspace W/Im(L2 ), which proves our claim. Set Im(L1 ) = Im(L1 ) \u2229 Im(L2 ) \u2295 Z, with\nZ \u2282 W a (closed) finite dimensional subspace. We now claim that Ker(L1 ) has finite\n\u22121\ncodimension in L\u22121\n1 (Z); namely, one has an injective linear map from L1 (Z)/Ker(L1 )\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\nto Z. Set L1 (Z) = Ker(L1 ) \u2295 U , with U a (closed) finite dimensional subspace of\nU . Finally, let V \u2032 be a complement of Ker(L2 ) in V ; we will now show that U \u2032 \u2295 V \u2032 is a\ncomplement of Ker(L) in U \u2295 V . Assume (x, y) \u2208 U \u2032 \u2295 V \u2032 with L1 (x) + L2 (y) = 0;\nsince U \u2032 \u2282 L\u22121\n2 ), thus L1 (x) \u2208\n1 (Z), then\n\u0001 L1 (x) \u2208 Z. But L1 (x) = \u2212L2 (y) \u2208 Im(L\n\u2032\nZ \u2229 Im(L1 ) \u2229 Im(L2 ) = {0}, i.e., L1 (x) = L2 (y)\n=\n0.\nThus,\nx\n\u2208\nU\n\u2229\nKer(L1 ) = {0}\n\u0002\n\u0003\nand y \u2208 V \u2032 \u2229 Ker(L2 ) = {0}, which proves that U \u2032 \u2295 V \u2032 \u2229 Ker(L) = {0}.\nLet now (x, y) \u2208 U \u2295 V be arbitrary; write L1 (x) = L1 (u) + z, where u \u2208 U ,\nL1 (u) \u2208 Im(L2 ) and z \u2208 Z. Since z \u2208 Z \u2282 Im(L1 ), one has z = L1 (a) for some a \u2208 U \u2032 ;\nthus, x = u + a + b for some b \u2208 Ker(L1 ). Choose w \u2208 V \u2032 such that L1 (u) = L2 (w),\nand set y = c + v, where c \u2208 Ker(L2 ) and v \u2208 V \u2032 . Then, (u + b, c \u2212 w) \u2208 Ker(L),\n(a, v + w)\u0002 \u2208 U \u2032 \u2295 V \u2032 and (x, y) = (u + b, c \u2212 w) + (a, v + w), which proves that\nKer(L) + U \u2032 \u2295 V \u2032 ] = U \u2295 V .\n\u0003\n2.2. Geometric preliminaries. Let M be a smooth manifold with dim(M ) \u2265 2 and\nlet \u2207 be an arbitrarily fixed symmetric connection on T M . Given another (symmetric)\nconnection \u2207\u2032 on T M , there exists a (symmetric) (1, 2)-tensor \u0393 on M defined by:\n\u2207\u2032 = \u2207 + \u0393,\nthat will be called the Christoffel tensor of \u2207\u2032 relatively to \u2207. If \u2207g is the Levi\u2013Civita\nconnection of some semi-Riemannian metric tensor g on M , then using Koszul's formula,\n\n\f6\n\nL. BILIOTTI, M. A. JAVALOYES, AND P.

The curvature tensor Rg of the connection \u2207g will be chosen with the following\nsign convention: Rg (X, Y ) = [\u2207gX , \u2207gY ] \u2212 \u2207g[X,Y ] . The symbol exp will denote the\nexponential map of the connection \u2207.\nGiven a smooth vector bundle \u03c0 : E \u2192 M over M , we will denote by \u0393(E) the space of\nall smooth sections of E; given a smooth map between manifolds f : N \u2192 M , then f \u2217 (E)\nwill denote the pull-back bundle over N . The fiber \u03c0 \u22121 (x) over a point x \u2208 M will be\ndenoted by Ex ; the dimension of the typical fiber of E will be called the rank of E. In this\npaper, we will be mostly interested in tensor bundles over M , i.e., all those vector bundles\nobtained by functorial constructions from the tangent bundle T M and the cotangent bundle\nT M \u2217 . Given nonnegative integers r, s, we will denote by T M \u2217 (r) \u2297 T M (s) the tensor\nproduct of r copies of T M \u2217 and s copies of T M ; sections of T M \u2217 (r) \u2297 T M (s) are called\ntensors of type (s, r) on M .\nThe following is a result that says that we can find global sections of a vector bundle\nwith prescribed value and covariant derivative along a sufficiently short curve in M .\nLemma 2.4. Let \u03c0 : E \u2192 M be a smooth vector bundle endowed with\n\u0001 a connection \u2207,\nlet \u03b3 : [a, b] \u2192 M be a smooth immersion and let V \u2208 \u0393 \u03b3 \u2217 (T M ) be a smooth vector\nfield along \u03b3 such that Vt0 is not parallel to \u03b3\u0307(t0 ) for some t0 \u2208 ]a, b[. Then, there exists\nan open interval I \u2282 [a, b] containing t0 with the property that, given smooth sections H\nand K of \u03b3 \u2217 (E) with compact support in I and given any open set U containing \u03b3(I),\nthen there exists h \u2208 \u0393(E) with compact support contained in U , such that h\u03b3(t) = Ht\nand \u2207Vt h = Kt for all t \u2208 I.\nProof. Let I \u2282 ]a, b[ be a sufficiently small open interval such that \u03b3|I is an embedding\nand such that Vt is not parallel to \u03b3\u0307(t) for all t \u2208 I; let S \u2282 M be a smooth hypersurface\ncontaining \u03b3(I)\n\u0001 and such that V\u0001t 6\u2208 T\u03b3(t) S for all t \u2208 I. Choose a smooth section V \u2208\n\u0393 S \u2217 (T M ) such that V \u03b3(t) = Vt for all t \u2208 I. By possibly reducing the size of I\nand S, we can assume the existence of a small positive number \u03b5 and a diffeomorphism\ne \u2282 U , where U\ne is an open subset of M contained\n\u03c6 : S \u00d7 ]\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5[ \u220b (x, \u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03c6(x, \u03bb) \u2208 U\n\u2202\u03c6\nin U that contains \u03b3(I), such that \u2202\u03bb (x, 0) = V (x) for all x \u2208 S. For instance, such a\ndiffeomorphism can be constructed using the exponential\nmap exp\u2032 of some connection\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne\n\u2207 in T M by setting \u03c6(x, \u03bb) = expx \u03bbV (x) for all (x, \u03bb) \u2208 S \u00d7 ]\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5[. Clearly, U\ncan be chosen small enough so that E|Ue admits a trivialization; let r \u2208\n\u0001 N be the rank of\nE and let p(x, \u03bb) : Rr \u2192 E\u03c6(x,\u03bb) be a smooth referential of \u03c6\u2217 E|Ue with the property\nD\nthat d\u03bb\np(x, \u03bb) = 0, i.e., p is parallel along the curves ]\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5[ \u220b \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03c6(x, \u03bb). For\ninstance, such referential p can be chosen by selecting an arbitrary smooth referential of\nE along S, and then extending by parallel transport along the curve \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03c6(x, \u03bb). The\nproblem of determining the required section h is now reduced to the search of a smooth\nmap e\nh : S \u00d7 ]\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5[ \u2192 Rr having compact support such that:\n\u0001\n\u0001\u22121\n\u2022 e\nh \u03b3(t), 0 = p \u03b3(t), 0\nHt ;\n\u0001\n\u0001\u22121\n\u2202e\nh\n\u03b3(t), 0 = p \u03b3(t), 0\nKt ,\n\u2022\n\u2202\u03bb\ne\nfor all t \u2208 I. Once\n\u0001 such h has been determined, the desired section h will be obtained by\ne.\nsetting h \u03c6(x, \u03bb) = p(x, \u03bb) \u25e6 e\nh(x, \u03bb) for all (x, \u03bb) \u2208 S \u00d7 ]\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5[ and h = 0 outside U\ne\ne\ne\nThe function h can be constructed as follows. First,\nchoose\n\u0001\n\u0001 smooth maps H, K\u0001 :\ne \u03b3(t) = Ht and p \u03b3(t), 0 \u25e6\nS \u2192 Rr having compact support such that p \u03b3(t), 0 \u25e6 H\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n7\n\n\u0001\ne \u03b3(t) = Kt for all t \u2208 I. Finally, define e\ne\ne\nK\nh(x, \u03bb) = H(x)\n+ f (\u03bb)K(x),\nwhere\nf : ]\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5[ \u2192 R is a smooth function with compact support such that f (\u03bb) = \u03bb near\n\u03bb = 0. This concludes the construction and proves the Lemma.\n\u0003\nGiven a g-geodesic \u03b3 : I \u2192 M in M , a Jacobi field along \u03b3 is a smooth vector\u0001 field\nJ along \u03b3 that satisfies the second order linear equation (Dg )2 J(t) = Rg \u03b3\u0307(t), J(t) \u03b3\u0307(t)\nfor all t, where Dg denotes covariant differentiation along \u03b3 relatively to the connection\n\u2207g . The endpoints of \u03b3 are said to be conjugate along \u03b3 if there exists a non trivial Jacobi\nfield along \u03b3 that vanishes at both endpoints of I. Affine multiples of the tangent field \u03b3\u0307\nare Jacobi fields; conversely, the only Jacobi fields along \u03b3 that are everywhere parallel to\n\u03b3\u0307 must be affine multiples of \u03b3\u0307. Other than that, Jacobi fields are parallel to the tangent\nfield \u03b3\u0307 only at isolated points:\nLemma 2.5. Let \u03b3 : [a, b] \u2192 M be a geodesic in (M, g), and let J be a Jacobi field which\nis not everywhere parallel to \u03b3\u0307. Then, the set:\n\b\nt \u2208 [a, b] : Jt is parallel to \u03b3\u0307(t)\n\nis finite.\n\ng\nProof. Since \u03b3\u0307 is parallel,\nS the covariant differentiation operator D defines a connection\non the quotient bundle t\u2208[a,b] T\u03b3(t) M/R\u03b3\u0307(t) over the interval [a, b], that will be dee Moreover, by the anti-symmetry of the curvature tensor, the linear operator\nnoted by D.\ng\nR \u03b3\u0307(t), *)\u03b3\u0307(t) : T\u03b3(t) M \u2192 T\u03b3(t) M passes to the quotient and gives a well defined opet : T\u03b3(t) M/R\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2192 T\u03b3(t) M/R\u03b3\u0307(t). Thus, the class Je = J + R\u03b3\u0307 satisfies the\nerator R\ne 2 Je = R\neJ.\ne If the zeroes of Je were not isolated,\nsecond order linear differential equation D\ne\nthen J would be identically zero, i.e., J would be everywhere parallel to \u03b3\u0307.\n\u0003\n\n3. A N\n\nABSTRACT GENERICITY RESULT\n\nIn this section we will study the nondegeneracy of critical points of a smoothly varying\nfamily of variational problems; we will prove the result of [27, Theorem 1.2] in the context\nof Banach and Hilbert manifolds. The approach followed is classical (see [5, Chapter 4], or\n[3, Section 2.11]), and several of the results presented in this section are very likely already\nexisting in the literature in some form. The authors have found White's formulation of the\ntransversality assumption (see (3.1)) particularly well suited for their purposes, and decided\nto write complete proofs of its extension to the Banach manifold setting.\nRecall that, given Banach manifolds X and Y, a smooth submanifold Z \u2282 Y, and a\nC 1 -map F : X \u2192\u0001 Y, then F is said to be transversal to Z \u0001if for all x0 \u2208 F \u22121 (Z),\ndF (x0 )\u22121 TF (x0 ) Z is complemented in Tx0 X and Im dF (x0 ) + TF (x0 ) Z = TF (x0 ) Y.\nUnder these circumstances, M = F \u22121 (Z) is a smooth\u0001 embedded submanifold of X , and\nfor all x0 \u2208 M, Tx0 M is given by dF (x0 )\u22121 TF (x0 ) Z .\nProposition 3.1.

From (3.2), the image d\u03a0(x0 , y0 ) T(x0 ,y0 ) M is given by the inverse image\n\u0015\u22121 h \u0010 2\n\u0014 2\n\u0011i\n\u2202 f\n\u2202 f\n(x0 , y0 ) ;\n(x0 , y0 )\nIm\n2\n\u2202x\u2202y\n\u2202y\n2\n\nsince \u2202\u2202yf2 (x0 , y0 ) is Fredholm, its image has finite codimension in Ty0 Y . By Lemma 2.2,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nalso T(x0 ,y0 ) M has finite codimension in Tx0 X, so that d\u03a0(x0 , y0 ) T(x0 ,y0 ) M is closed\nand therefore Fredholm. In fact, since by assumption (3.1) the linear map\n\n\u22022f\n\u2202x\u2202y (x0 , y0 )\n\n\u2295\n\n\u22022f\n\u2202y 2 (x0 , y0 )\n\nis surjective, we have that by Lemma 2.2 the codimension of the image of\n\u0001\n2\n2\nd\u03a0(x0 , y0 )|T(x0 ,y0 ) M equals the codimension of Im \u2202\u2202yf2 (x0 , y0 ) ; as \u2202\u2202yf2 (x0 , y0 ) is a selfadjoint Fredholm operator, this codimension coincides with the dimension of\n\u0013\u22a5\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u0012 2\n\u2202 f\n\u2202 f\n(x0 , y0 )\n(x0 , y0 ) ,\n= Ker\nIm\n\u22022y\n\u22022y\nso that the Fredholm index of d\u03a0(x0 , y0 )|T(x0 ,y0 ) M is equal to zero.\nIt is easily seen that (x0 , y0 ) is a regular point of \u03a0|M , i.e., that d\u03a0(x0 , y0 )|T(x0 ,y0 ) M is\nsurjective, if and only if:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u0012 2\n\u2202 f\n\u2202 f\n(x0 , y0 ) ;\n(x0 , y0 ) \u2282 Im\n(3.3)\nIm\n\u2202x\u2202y\n\u2202y 2\n\u0010 2\n\u0011\u22a5\n\u0011\n\u0010 2\nusing again that Im \u2202\u2202 2fy (x0 , y0 )\n= Ker \u2202\u2202 2 fy (x0 , y0 ) , and taking orthogonal complements, (3.3) becomes:\n\u0013\n\u0013\u22a5\n\u0012 2\n\u0012 2\n\u2202 f\n\u2202 f\n(x0 , y0 ) .\n(x0 , y0 )\nIm\n\u2283 Ker\n\u2202x\u2202y\n\u2202y 2\n\u0010 2\n\u0011\nUsing assumption (3.1), (x0 , y0 ) is a regular point of \u03a0|M if and only if Ker \u2202\u2202yf2 (x0 , y0 )\n\nis trivial, i.e., if and only if x0 is a nondegenerate critical point of x 7\u2192 f (x, y0 ).\nThus, the set of x \u2208 X such that the functional Ax \u220b y 7\u2192 f (x, y) \u2208 R is a Morse\nfunction coincides with the set of regular values of the map \u03a0|M . The last statement\nfollows now immediately from Corollary 3.3 and Sard\u2013Smale's theorem (see [26]).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.5. We will apply Corollary 3.4 in situations where the Banach manifold X is\nindeed an open subset of a Banach space E. In this case, the partial derivative \u2202f\n\u2202x is a map\non X \u00d7 Y taking value in the fixed Banach space E \u2217 , and thus it can be differentiated with\nrespect to the second variable y. Given (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 M, we have two maps:\n\u22022f\n(x0 , y0 ) : E \u2192 Ty0 Y \u2217 ,\n\u2202x\u2202y\n\nand\n\n\u22022f\n(x0 , y0 ) : Ty0 Y \u2192 E \u2217 .\n\u2202y\u2202x\n\nUsing local charts and Schwarz Lemma, it is easy to see that these two maps are transpose\n\u22022 f\n(x0 , y0 ) as a bilinear form on E \u00d7 Ty0 Y\nof each other.

Given k \u2265 2 and \u03bd \u2208 {0, . . . , n}, we will denote by Metk\u03bd (M ) the set of all metric\ntensors g on M of class C k and having index \u03bd. This is a subset of the vector space\n\u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ) of all sections b of class C k of the vector bundle T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 such\nthat bx : Tx M \u00d7 Tx M \u2192 R is symmetric for all x.\nIt will be interesting to consider the case of non compact manifolds M , in which case\nthere is no canonical Banach structure on the space of tensors over M . In order to overcome\nthis problem, it will be useful to consider the following definition. A vector subspace E of\n\u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217) will be called3 a C k -Whitney type Banach space of tensor fields over\nM when:\n(a) E contains all tensor fields in \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ) having compact support;\n(b) E is endowed with a Banach space norm k * kE with the property that k * kE convergence of a sequence implies convergence in the weak Whitney C k -topology.\nMore explicitly, axiom (b) above means that given any sequence (bn )n\u2208N and an element\nb\u221e in E such that lim kbn \u2212 b\u221e kE = 0, and given any compact subset K \u2282 M , then the\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nrestriction bn |K tends to b\u221e |K in the C k -topology as n \u2192 \u221e.\n1. Example. Examples of C k -Whitney type Banach spaces of tensor fields over M can\nbe obtained easily introducing an auxiliary Riemannian metric gR on M , whose Levi\u2013\nCivita connection will be denoted by \u2207. The choice of the Riemannian metric gR induces\nnaturally a connection on all vector bundles over M that are obtained by functorial constructions from the tangent bundle T M . Moreover, for all r, s \u2208 N, we have Hilbert space\nnorms on every tensor product Tx M \u2217 (r) \u2297 Tx M (s) induced by gR ; all these norms will be\ndenoted by the same symbol k * kR . Then, we will denote by \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ) the\nsubset of \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ) consisting of all section b such that:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nj\n< +\u221e.\n(4.1)\nkbkk = max sup \u2207 b(x)\nj=0,...,k\n\nx\u2208M\n\nR\n\nWhen M is compact \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ) = \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ). Endowed with\nthe norm k * kk in (4.1), \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ) is a separable normed space, which\nis complete provided that the Riemannian metric gR is chosen to be complete. Clearly,\n\u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ) contains all elements in \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ) having compact\nsupport. Moreover, k * kk -convergence implies C k -convergence on compact sets. Thus,\n\u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217; gR ) is an example of C k -Whitney type Banach spaces of tensor fields\nover M .\n\nOther examples of C k -Whitney type Banach spaces of tensor fields over M can be\nobtained by considering elements in \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217) satisfying suitable boundedness\nassumptions at infinity on the first k covariant derivatives. Asymptotic flatness is a typical\nassumption, particularly fashionable among physicists.\n2For the remainder of the article, we will be somewhat sloppy about the use of the adjective \"smooth\". In\nthe case of manifolds, by smooth we will always mean \"of class C k , with k \u2265 3\", and in the case of tensors, in\nparticular metric tensors, smooth will mean \"of class C k , with k \u2265 2\". This guarantees that the corresponding\ngeodesic action functionals are of class at least C 2 . Clearly, manifolds are to be of class strictly larger than the\nrequired regularity class of tensors.\n3In this paper we will only be interested in metric tensor fields, but clearly a similar definition may be given\nfor tensor fields of all kind over M .\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n11\n\nIn the statements of some of our results, we will consider open subsets A of a given\nC k -Whitney type Banach space E of tensor fields over M , where the elements of A are\nassumed to be semi-Riemannian metric tensors of a given index. It is easy to show that,\nwhen M is not compact, the set Metk\u03bd (M ) \u2229 \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217; gR ) is not open in\n\u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ). A typical open4 subset of \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217; gR ) consisting\nof semi-Riemannian metric tensors of index \u03bd is:\no\nn\nMetk\u03bd,\u22c6 (M ; gR ) = b \u2208 Metk\u03bd (M ) \u2229 \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ) : sup kb\u22121\nk\n<\n+\u221e\n;\nR\nx\nx\u2208M\n\nb\u22121\nx\n\nhere,\nis the inverse of bx seen as a linear operator bx : Tx M \u2192 Tx M \u2217 . The assumption sup kb\u22121\nx kR < +\u221e is equivalent to requiring that the eigenvalue with minimum\nx\u2208M\n\nabsolute value of the gR -symmetric operator bx stays away from 0 uniformly on M .\nLet p, q \u2208 M be fixed points, and let \u03a9p,q (M ) denote the set of all curves \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 M\nof Sobolev class H 1 such that \u03b3(0) = p and \u03b3(1) = q; it is well known that \u03a9p,q (M )\nis endowed with\n\u0001 a Hilbert manifold structure modeled on the separable Hilbert space\nH01 [0, 1], Rn . For \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9p,q (M ), the pull-back bundle \u03b3 \u2217 (T M ) is endowed with a\nRiemannian structure on the fibers induced by the Riemannian structure gR . The tangent\nspace T\u03b3 \u03a9p,q (M ) is identified with the Hilbertable space of all sections V of \u03b3 \u2217 (T M ) having Sobolev class H 1 , and satisfying V (0) = V (1) = 0. For the purposes of this paper,\nthe choice of a specific Hilbert\u2013Riemann structure on the infinite dimensional manifold\n\u03a9p,q (M ) will not be relevant; however, it will be useful to have at disposal the following\ninner product on the tangent spaces T\u03b3 \u03a9p,q (M ):\nZ 1\n(4.2)\nh V, W i =\ngR (DR V, DR W ) dt.\n0\n\nHere, gR is an arbitrarily fixed complete Riemannian metric on M and DR denotes covariant differentiation of vector fields along \u03b3 with respect to the Levi\u2013Civita connection of\ngR .\n4.2. Genericity of metrics without degenerate geodesics. We will henceforth consider\na fixed C k -Whitney type Banach space E of tensor fields over M and a (non empty) open\nsubset A of E with A \u2282 E \u2229Metk\u03bd (M ). A complete Riemannian metric gR is also assumed\nto be fixed, in order to use the Hilbert manifold structure (4.2) in \u03a9p,q (M ). Consider the\ngeodesic action functional:\nF : A \u00d7 \u03a9p,q (M ) \u2212\u2192 R\ndefined by:\nF (g, \u03b3) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ng(\u03b3\u0307, \u03b3\u0307) dt.\n\n0\n\nThis is a map of class C k . More precisely, F is smooth (i.e., C \u221e ) in the variable g \u2208 A,\nwhile in the variable \u03b3 it is of class C k , the same regularity required for the metrics. This\nis easily proved, observing that taking j derivatives of F with respect to the variable \u03b3\ninvolves5 the first j derivatives of the metric g.\n4In order to see that the set Metk (M ; g ) is open in \u0393k (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; g ), one uses the fact that the\nR\nR\nsym\n \u0306 \u03bd,\u22c6\n \u0304\nfunction A 7\u2192 \u03bb\u2217 (A) = min |\u03bb| : \u03bb is an eigenvalue of A is Lipschitz continuous on the set of symmetric\noperators A on Rn . This is proved easily using the equality \u03bb\u2217 (A) = minkxk=1 kAxk, from which one\ndeduces that |\u03bb\u2217 (A) \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 (B)| \u2264 kA \u2212 Bk for all symmetric operators A and B.\n5For instance, the first derivative \u2202F (\u03b3 , g ) in the direction V \u2208 T \u03a9 (M ) is given by the integral\n\u03b3 p,q\n0 0\n\u2202\u03b3\nR1\ng0\ng0 is the covariant derivative of vector fields along \u03b3 relatively to the Levi\u2013Civita\n0 g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , D V ) dt, where D\nconnection \u2207g0 of g0 . This requires the Christoffel tensors of g, which are computed in terms of the first\n2\nderivatives of the metric coefficients. The second derivative \u2202\u2202\u03b3F2 (\u03b30 , g0 ) involves the curvature tensor of \u2207g0\n(see formula (4.3)), i.e., the second derivative of g. Higher order derivatives of F with respect to \u03b3 are computed\nin terms of higher order covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor of \u2207g0 .\n\n\f12\n\nL. BILIOTTI, M. A. JAVALOYES, AND P.

This is the classical index form of \u03b30\nrelatively to the metric g0 .\n2\n\nLemma 4.1. \u2202\u2202\u03b3F2 (g0 , \u03b30 ) is a Fredholm symmetric bilinear form on T\u03b30 \u03a9p,q (M ), i.e., it\nis represented by a self-adjoint Fredholm operator on T\u03b30 \u03a9p,q (M ) relatively to the inner\nproduct (4.2).\nProof. For all t \u2208 [0, 1], let At : T\u03b3(t) M \u2192 T\u03b3(t) M be the gR -symmetric automorphism such that g0 = gR (At *, *) on T\u03b3(t) M .

Namely, the difference E(V, W ) = \u2202\u2202\u03b3F2 (g0 , \u03b30 )(V, W ) \u2212 h \u03a6V, W i is\neasily computed as:\nZ 1h\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212 gR A\u2032 V, DR W ) + gR A\u0393R V, DR W + gR ADR V, \u0393R W\nE(V, W ) =\n0\ni\n+ gR (A\u0393R V, \u0393R W ) + gR (ARV, W ) dt,\nwhere \u0393R = Dg0 \u2212 DR is the Christoffel tensor of \u2207g0 relatively to \u2207R . Each term in\nthe right hand side of the above equality is bilinear in (V, W ), and does not contain any\nderivative of at least one of its two arguments, i.e., it is continuous relatively to the C 0 topology in one of its arguments. From the compactness of the inclusion H 1 \u0592\u2192 C 0 , it\n\u0003\nfollows easily that E is represented by a compact operator on T\u03b30 \u03a9p,q (M ).\nThe kernel of the index form\n\n\u22022F\n\u2202\u03b3 2\n\n(g0 , \u03b30 ) is the space of all Jacobi fields J along \u03b30\n2\n\n\u2202 F\nsuch that J(0) = J(1) = 0.

Let (M, g) be a semi-Riemannian manifold, and let \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 M be a\ngeodesic. Then, the set:\n\b\n(s, t) \u2208 [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] : s 6= t, \u03b3(s) = \u03b3(t)\nis finite, unless \u03b3 is a closed geodesic with period T < 1.\n\nProof. Assume the existence of sequences sn and tn in [0, 1], with sn 6= tn , \u03b3(sn ) = \u03b3(tn )\nand si 6= sj for all i 6= j (otherwise the pairs (sn , tn ) would be a finite number). Because\nof the local injectivity of \u03b3 we can assume that ti 6= tj for all i 6= j, and up to taking\nsubsequences, that lim sn = s and lim tn = t, with s, t \u2208 [0, 1]; we can also assume\nthat sn 6= s and tn 6= t for all n. Clearly, \u03b3(s) = \u03b3(t); since \u03b3 is locally injective (it\nis an immersion), then it must be s 6= t, say t > s. Set \u03bc(r) = \u03b3(r \u2212 t + s); this is a\ngeodesic, defined for r in a neighborhood of t, and such that \u03bc(t) = \u03b3(t). Moreover, set\nt\u2032n = sn \u2212 s + t; this is a sequence converging to t, and with t\u2032n 6= t for all n. We have\n\u03bc(t\u2032n ) = \u03b3(tn ) for all n, and this implies that the tangent vectors \u03bc\u0307(t) = \u03b3\u0307(s) and \u03b3\u0307(t)\nare linearly dependent. Since \u03b3 is affinely parameterized, it must be \u03b3\u0307(s) = \u03b3\u0307(t), which\nimplies that \u03b3 is periodic with period T = t \u2212 s \u2264 1. It can't be T = 1, i.e., s = 0 and\nt = 1, because otherwise it would be \u03b3(tn ) = \u03b3(sn ) = \u03b3(sn + 1) for all n, with tn < 1\nand sn + 1 > 1 converging to 1, contradicting the local injectivity of \u03b3 around 1.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.3. Let M be a smooth manifold, let E \u2282 \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ) be a C k Whitney type Banach space of tensors over M , with k \u2265 2, let \u03bd \u2208 {0, . . . , dim(M )} be\nfixed and let A \u2282 E \u2229 Metk\u03bd (M ) be an open subset of E.

We will prove the result as application of Corollary 3.4 to the geodesic setup above.\nIn view of the Fredholmness result of Lemma 4.1, we only need to check that the transversality condition (3.1) is satisfied in this context. We need to prove that, given a semiRiemannian metric g0 \u2208 A, a g0 -geodesic \u03b30 joining p and q, and a non trivial g0 -Jacobi\nfield V along \u03b30 , with V0 = V1 = 0, then there exists h \u2208 E for which the quantity in the\nlast term of (4.4) does not vanish. We will find such an h to be a symmetric (0, 2)-tensor\nof class C k having compact support in M , and thus h \u2208 E. Assume first that \u03b30 is not a\nportion of a closed geodesic in M with minimal period T < 1. Then, by Lemma 4.2, \u03b30\nhas at most a finite number of self-intersections. We can therefore find an open subinterval\nI \u2282 [0, 1] with the following properties:\n(a) t \u2208 I and s 6\u2208 I implies \u03b30 (s) 6= \u03b30 (t);\n(b) Vt is not parallel to \u03b3\u03070 (t) for all t \u2208 I.\nAs to property (b), observe that since V is a nontrivial Jacobi field which vanishes at the\nendpoints, then it is not everywhere multiple of \u03b3\u03070 , and by Lemma 2.5 the set of instants\nt at which Vt is parallel to \u03b3\u03070 (t) is finite. Choose now an open subset U \u2282 M containing\n\u03b30 (I) and such that\n\u0001\n\u21d0\u21d2 t \u2208 I;\n(4.5)\n\u03b30 (t) \u2208 U \u2229 \u03b30 [0, 1]\n\u0001\nfor instance, take U to be the complement of the compact set \u03b30 [0, 1]\\I . We will now use\nthe result of Lemma 2.4 applied to the case of symmetric (0, 2)-tensor fields, as follows.\nFor t \u2208 I, we choose Ht identically zero, and Kt a symmetric\nbilinear form on T\u03b3\u00010 (t) M\n\u0001\nR\n(depending smoothly on t) such that Kt \u03b3\u03070 (t), \u03b3\u03070 (t) \u2265 0 with I Kt \u03b3\u03070 (t), \u03b3\u03070 (t) dt >\n0. By possibly reducing the size of the interval I, we can assume that the thesis of\nLemma 2.4 applies, and we get a globally defined smooth symmetric (2, 0)-tensor h on\nM , having compact support contained in U , such that h\u03b30 (t) = 0 and \u2207Vt h = Kt for all\nt \u2208 I. For such h, by (4.5) we have:\nZ\nZ 1h\ni\n\u0001\nh(\u03b3\u03070 , DV ) + 12 \u2207h(V, \u03b3\u03070 , \u03b3\u03070 ) dt = 12 Kt \u03b3\u03070 (t), \u03b3\u03070 (t) dt > 0,\n0\n\nI\n\n\f14\n\nL.

Consider the following numbers:\n\b\n\b\nt\u2217 = min t > 0 : \u03b30 (t) = q , k\u2217 = max k \u2208 Z : kT < 1 ,\nfor which the following hold:7\n\nk\u2217 \u2265 1,\n\n0 < t\u2217 < T,\n\n1 = k\u2217 T + t\u2217 .\n\nThe geodesics \u03b31 = \u03b30 |[0,t\u2217 ] and \u03b32 = \u03b30 |[t\u2217 ,T ] join p and q (\u03b32 with the opposite orientation), and the first part of the proof applies to both \u03b31 and \u03b32 . Thus, we can find open\nintervals I1 = [a1 , b1 ] \u2282 [0, t\u2217 ] and I2 = [a2 , b2 ] \u2282 [t\u2217 , T ] such that:\n\u0001\n(a1) t \u2208 I1 , s \u2208 [0, t\u2217 ] \\ I1 \u0001\u222a [t\u2217 , T ] implies \u03b30 (s) 6= \u03b30 (t);\n(a2) t \u2208 I2 , s \u2208 [t\u2217 , T ] \\ I2 \u222a [0, t\u2217 ] implies \u03b30 (s) 6= \u03b30 (t).\n\nWe can also find open subsets U1 , U2 \u2282 M , with \u03b3(Ii ) \u2282 Ui , i = 1, 2, satisfying:\n(4.6)\n\n\u03b30 (t) \u2208 U1 \u2229 \u03b30 (I1 )\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u2203 r \u2208 {0, . . . , k\u2217 } such that t \u2212 rT \u2208 I1 ,\n\n\u03b30 (t) \u2208 U2 \u2229 \u03b30 (I2 )\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u2203 r \u2208 {0, . . . , k\u2217 \u2212 1} such that t \u2212 rT \u2208 I2 .\n\nFor j = 1, 2, consider the orthogonal Jacobi field W j along \u03b3j defined by:\nk\u2217\nX\n\nWt1 =\n\n(4.7)\n\nWt2 =\n\nVt+rT ,\n\nr=0\n\nkX\n\u2217 \u22121\n\nVt+rT .\n\nr=0\n\nIt is not the case that both W 1 and W 2 are everywhere parallel to \u03b3\u03070 on I1 and I2 respectively, for otherwise from (4.7) one would conclude easily that V would be everywhere\nparallel to \u03b3\u03070 (Lemma 2.5). Assume that, say, W 1 is not everywhere parallel to \u03b3\u03070 on I1 ,\ni.e., by Lemma 2.5, there are only isolated values of t where Wt1 is parallel to \u03b3\u03070 (t); the\nother case is totally analogous. By reducing the size of I1 , we can assume that Wt1 is never\na multiple of \u03b3\u03070 (t) on I1 . Now, the first part of the proof can be repeated, by replacing the\nJacobi field V with W 1 . We can find a globally defined symmetric (0, 2)-tensor h on M ,\nwith compact support contained in U1 , with prescribed value H and covariant derivative\nK in the direction W 1 along \u03b30 |I1 .

Perturbations of a metric in its conformal class. It is a natural question to ask\nwhether the genericity result of Proposition 4.3 remains true if one consider more restrictive classes of variations of a given metric. Particularly interesting examples are perturbations inside a given conformal class of semi-Riemannian metrics. However, one cannot\nexpect that the genericity result holds in this case, as the following example shows.\n2. Example. Let (M, g0 ) be a semi-Riemannian manifold, and let \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 M be a\nlightlike geodesic in M with p = \u03b3(0) and q = \u03b3(1) conjugate along \u03b3. Then, given\nany semi-Riemannian metric g on M which is conformal to g0 , there exists a suitable\n7Here the assumption that p 6= q is being used. Note that if p = q, then t = T , and the argument below\n\u2217\n\nfails.\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n15\n\nreparameterization \u03b3\ne of \u03b3 which is a lightlike g-geodesic, and such that p and q are conjugate8 along \u03b3\ne (see for instance [23, Theorem 2.36]). Thus, conformal perturbations do not\ndestroy degeneracy of lightlike geodesics.\nWe will show that, apart from the lightlike case, generic conformal perturbations are\nsufficient to destroy degeneracy. In view of Example 2, this is the best possible result.\nGiven a semi-Riemannian metric tensor \u1e21 on M of class C k , k \u2265 2, let us denote by\nk\nC (\u1e21) the set of all semi-Riemannian metrics on M that are globally conformal to \u1e21, i.e.,\nthe set of metrics of the form g = \u03c8 * \u1e21 for some function \u03c8 : M \u2192 R+ of class C k .\nAs above, when M is not compact, there is no natural topological structure on Ck (\u1e21) that\nmakes it homeomorphic to an open subset of a Banach space. Let us denote by C k (M )\nthe vector space of all real valued C k -functions on M . In analogy with the notion of C k Whitney type Banach spaces of tensor fields, let us call a C k -Whitney type Banach space\nof functions on M a vector subspace F of C k (M ) endowed with a Banach space norm\nk * kF satisfying:\n(a) F contains all the functions in C k (M ) having compact support;\n(b) k * kF -convergence implies C k -convergence on compact subsets of M .\nFor instance, given a complete Riemannian metric gR on M , a C k -Whitney type Banach\nspace of functions on M can be obtained by setting F = Ck (M ; gR ), which consists of all\nfunctions in C k (M ) that have gR -bounded derivatives up to order k.\nGiven a C k -Whitney type Banach space F of functions on M and a semi-Riemannian\nmetric tensor \u1e21 on M , let us denote by Ck (\u1e21; F ) the set:\n\b\nCk (\u1e21; F ) = \u03c8 * \u1e21 : \u03c8 \u2208 F .\nand by Ck+ (\u1e21; F ) the F -conformal class of \u1e21, defined by:\n\b\nCk+ (\u1e21; F ) = \u03c8 * \u1e21 : \u03c8 \u2208 F , \u03c8 > 0 .\n\nThe map \u03c8 7\u2192 \u03c8 * \u1e21 gives an identification of the set Ck (\u1e21, F ) with the Banach space F\n(and of Ck+ (\u1e21, F ) with the subset F+ of everywhere positive functions of F ); Ck (\u1e21, F )\nwill be thought as a metric space with the induced norm.\nProposition 4.4. Let M be a smooth manifold, \u1e21 a semi-Riemannian metric tensor on\nM of class C k , k \u2265 2, and let p, q \u2208 M be fixed distinct points. Let F \u2282 C k (M ) be\na C k -Whitney type Banach space of functions on M , and let A be a (non empty) open\nsubset of Ck (\u1e21; F ) contained in Ck+ (\u1e21; F ). Then, the set of metrics g \u2208 A such that every\nnonlightlike g-geodesic in M joining p and q is nondegenerate is generic in A.\nProof. Let g0 \u2208 A and \u03b30 be a non lightlike, i.e., g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , \u03b3\u03070 ) 6= 0, g0 -geodesic in M joining\np and q; let V be a nontrivial g0 -Jacobi field along \u03b30 that vanishes at both endpoints.\nWe will find a variation h of the form \u03c8 * g0 , with \u03c8 : M \u2192 R a smooth nonnegative\nfunction with small compact support, and for which the last term in (4.4) does not vanish.\nFor such a variation h, the last term of (4.4) is easily computed by choosing \u2207 to be the\nLevi\u2013Civita connection of g0 . Namely, in this case g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , DV ) vanishes identically; this\nis because the function g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , V ) is affine, and since it vanishes at 0 and at 1, it must be\nidentically zero, as well as its derivative g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , DV ). Thus, for such a variation h, the\nquantity h(\u03b3\u03070 , DV ) vanishes identically. Moreover, since \u2207g0 = 0, then \u2207h(V, \u03b3\u03070 , \u03b3\u03070 ) =\n8In the Lorentzian case, conjugate points along lightlike geodesics are preserved even by maps more general than conformal diffeomorphisms. It is not hard to prove (for instance, via bifurcation theory using [19,\nCorollary 11]) the following:\n\nLemma. Let (Mi , gi ), i = 1, 2, be Lorentzian manifolds, and let \u03a8 : M1 \u2192 M2 be a continuous injective\nmap that carries timelike curves to timelike curves and lightlike pre-geodesic to lightlike pre-geodesics. Then, \u03a8\ncarries pairs of conjugate points along lightlike geodesics into pairs of conjugate points along lightlike geodesics.\nNote that if \u03a8 as in the statement of the Lemma is a diffeomorphism, then necessarily \u03a8 is conformal, by a\nwell known result of Dajczer and Nomizu, see [13].\n\n\f16\n\nL. BILIOTTI, M. A. JAVALOYES, AND P. PICCIONE\n\nV (\u03c8) * g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , \u03b3\u03070 ). Since we are assuming that the constant g0 (\u03b3\u03070 , \u03b3\u03070 ) is not null, we\nhave now reduced the problem to determining a smooth nonnegative function \u03c8 with the\n\u0001\nR1\nproperty that 0 V \u03c8(\u03b30 (t)) dt 6= 0; we want such a function \u03c8 with compact support\nin M . For the construction of such \u03c8, the procedure is analogous to that in the proof of\nProposition 4.3, using Lemma 2.4. Assume first that \u03b30 is not a portion of a closed geodesic\nin M with minimal period T < 1. Then, by Lemma 4.2, \u03b30 has at most a finite number of\nself-intersections. and we can find an open subinterval I \u2282 [0, 1] satisfying properties (a)\nand (b) in the proof of Proposition 4.3, and an open subset U \u2282 M containing \u03b30 (I) and\nsuch that (4.5) Rholds. Now, choose a smooth function \u03b1 : I \u2192 R having compact support\nand such that I \u03b1(t) dt > 0. By Lemma 2.4 (applied to the case of the trivial vector\nbundle E over M whose fiber is one dimensional), we can find\n\u0001 a smooth map \u03c8 : M \u2192 R\nhaving compact support contained in U , such that \u03c8 \u03b30 (t) = 1 and Vt \u03c8) = \u03b1(t) for all\nt \u2208 I. With this choice, we have:\nZ\nZ 1\nZ\nby (4.5)\nVt (\u03c8) dt = \u03b1(t) dt > 0.\n(4.8)\nVt (\u03c8) dt =\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\nThis concludes the proof in the case that \u03b30 is not a portion of a closed geodesic. When\n\u03b30 is periodic with period T < 1, the construction is totally analogous to the proof of\nProposition 4.3. One defines Jacobi fields W 1 and W 2 as in (4.7), open intervals Ii \u2282 [0, 1]\nand open subsets Ui \u2282 M satisfying (4.6); by the same arguments, one obtains that at least\none of two Jacobi fields, say W i , is never parallel to \u03b3\u03070 (t) on Ii . Define \u03c8 : M \u2192 R\nas above replacing the Jacobi field V with W i and the interval\nI with Ii using a smooth\nR\nfunction \u03b1 : Ii \u2192 R with compact support and satisfying Ii \u03b1(t) dt > 0.

Orthogonally split metrics. Let us now take a product manifold M = M1 \u00d7 M2 ,\nwith dim(Mi ) = ni , i = 1, 2, and consider the subset Metksplit (M1 , M2 ) of Metkn2 (M )\nconsisting of all symmetric (0, 2)-tensors g of class C k on M such that:\n\u0001\n(a) g(x,y) (v1 , 0), (0, v2 ) = 0;\n(b) g(x,y) is positive definite on Tx M1 \u00d7 {0};\n(c) g(x,y) is negative definite9 on {0} \u00d7 Ty M2 ,\nfor all (x, y) \u2208 M1 \u00d7M2 , all v1 \u2208 Tx M1 and all v2 \u2208 Ty M2 . Elements of Metksplit(M1 ,M2)\nwill be called orthogonally split semi-Riemannian metric tensors on M1 \u00d7 M2 . More\ngenerally, a (0, 2)-tensor field b on M will be called orthogonally split if it satisfies\n\u0001\nb(x,y) (v1 , 0), (0, v2 ) = 0\n\nfor all (x, y) \u2208 M1 \u00d7 M2 , all v1 \u2208 Tx M1 and all v2 \u2208 Ty M2 .\nLet E \u2282 \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ) be a C k -Whitney type Banach space of tensors on M ;\nwe will denote by Metksplit (M1 , M2 ; E) the intersection Metksplit (M1 , M2 ) \u2229 E. Note that\nthe set Esplit consisting of all orthogonally split tensor fields in E is a (non trivial) closed\nsubspace of E. Non triviality follows from the fact that Esplit contains all the orthogonally\nsplit tensor fields on M having compact support.\n\nProposition 4.5. Let M1 and M2 be smooth manifolds, let E be a C k -Whitney type Banach\nspace of tensors on the product M = M1 \u00d7 M2 , and let A be an open subset of Esplit with\nA \u2282 Metksplit (M1 , M2 ; E). Given any two distinct points p, q \u2208 M , then the set of all\ng \u2208 A such that all g-geodesics in M joining p and q are nondegenerate is generic in A.\n9In fact, rather than (b) and (c), we will use the weaker assumptions that g is nondegenerate on T M \u00d7 {0}\n1\nand on {0} \u00d7 T M2 .\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n17\n\nProof. Let g0 \u2208 A be fixed and consider a g0 -geodesic \u03b30 = (x1 , x2 ) joining p and q, and\na nontrivial g0 -Jacobi field V = (V1 , V2 ) along \u03b30 which vanishes at the endpoints. The\nproof goes along the same lines as the proof of Proposition 4.3, with the difference that here\nthe variation h has to be found in the Banach space Esplit . Again, we will determine the\nvariation h to be an orthogonally split symmetric (0, 2)-tensor field having compact support\nin M . One has to repeat the proof of Proposition 4.3, which involves the construction of\na family of bilinear forms Kt on T\u03b30 (t) M = Tx1 (t) M1 \u2295 Tx2 (t) M2 with the property\n\u0001\nR\nthat I Kt \u03b3\u03070 (t), \u03b3\u03070 (t) dt > 0 on some given interval I. Recall that in the proof of\nProposition 4.3 we are choosing the family Ht to vanish identically. In\u0001 the case under\nconsideration, the desired Kt can be chosen such that Kt (v1 , 0), (0, v2 ) = 0 for every\nv1 \u2208 Tx1 (t) M1 , v2 \u2208 Tx2 (t) M2 and every t \u2208 I. Namely, it suffices to choose families of\nsymmetric bilinear forms Kti on Txi (t) Mi , i = 1, 2, satisfying\n(4.9)\n\n2 Z\nX\ni=1\n\nI\n\n\u0001\nKti \u1e8bi (t), \u1e8bi (t) dt > 0\n\n\u0001\nand set Kt (v1 , v2 ), (w1 , w2 ) = Kt1 (v1 , w1 ) + Kt2 (v2 , w2 ) for all t. The existence of\nfamilies Kti that satisfy (4.9) is easily proven, keeping in mind that \u1e8b1 (t) and \u1e8b2 (t) are not\nboth zero anywhere. Now, Lemma 2.4 is applied to the vector bundle E over M whose\n\u0001\nsections are the symmetric (0, 2)-tensors h on M satisfying h(x1 ,x2 ) (v1 , 0), (0, v2 ) = 0\nfor all xi \u2208 Mi and all vi \u2208 Txi Mi . In order to make the result of Lemma 2.4 compatible\nwith formula (4.4), one more detail needs to be clarified. Namely, one needs to consider\ne in T M ; more precisely,\na connection \u2207 in E which is inherited from a connection \u2207\ne on\n\u2207 has to be given as the restriction to the subbundle E of the induced connection \u2207\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nT M \u2297 T M . It will not be the case in general that connections on T M \u2297 T M restrict\nto E, i.e., that covariant derivatives of sections of E remain in E. In order to make the\ne restrictable to E, the corresponding connection \u2207\ne on T M has to be chosen\nconnection \u2207\nof the form:\ne = \u03c01\u2217 (\u22071 ) \u2295 \u03c02\u2217 (\u22072 ),\n\u2207\n\nwhere \u2207i is a connection on T Mi , and \u03c0i : M1 \u00d7 M2 \u2192 Mi is the projection, i = 1, 2.\nThis concludes the argument.\n\u0003\n\n4.5. Globally hyperbolic Lorentzian metrics. Let us now study the nondegeneracy problem for geodesics in globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. A time oriented Lorentzian\nmetric g on a connected manifold M is said to be globally hyperbolic if (M, g) admits a\nCauchy surface \u03a3, i.e., \u03a3 is a spacelike hypersurface of M which is met exactly once by\nevery non extendible causal curve. There are several equivalent notions of global hyperbolicity that will not be discussed here (see [7, 10, 24] for details). Let us recall that by a\nclassical result by Geroch [15], whose statement has been recently strengthened by Bernal\nand S\u00e1nchez in [8, 9], a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold (M, g) is isometric to a\nproduct \u03a3 \u00d7 R, where \u03a3 is any Cauchy surface of (M, g), endowed with an orthogonally\nsplit metric tensor which is positive definite on the factor \u03a3 and negative definite on the\none-dimensional factor R.

Note that G contains\nall pairs (\u03b1, \u03b2) of class C 2 having compact support, and its topology is finer than the weak\nWhitney C 2 -topology. As to the S\nsecond statement, it is enough to observe that A can be\ndescribed as the countable union n\u22651 A n1 ,n of open sets each of which contains a dense\nG\u03b4 with the desired property.\n\u0003\n4.6. Stationary Lorentzian metrics. Let us now consider the case of Lorentzian metrics\nadmitting a timelike Killing vector field; we will exhibit an example showing that the\ntransversality condition discussed in Subsection 4.2 does not hold in general in this class.\nLet (M, g) be a Lorentzian manifold, and assume the existence of a Killing vector field\nY on M . It is a simple observation that an integral line \u03b3 of Y is a geodesic in (M, g)\nif and only if at some point \u03b3(t0 ) of \u03b3 the function g(Y, Y ) has a critical point. Namely,\nsince g(Y, Y ) is invariant by the flow of Y , the existence of one critical point of g(Y, Y )\nalong \u03b3 is equivalent to the fact that every point of \u03b3 is critical for\u0001 g(Y, Y ). Now, \u0001\u03b3 is\na geodesic if and only if \u2207Y Y = 0 along \u03b3, i.e., if g \u2207Y (\u03b3(t)) Y, v = \u2212g \u2207v Y, Y =\n\n\f20\n\nL. BILIOTTI, M. A. JAVALOYES, AND P. PICCIONE\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 21 v g(Y, Y ) = 0 for all t and all v \u2208 T\u03b3(t) M , i.e., if and only if \u03b3(t) is a critical point\nof g(Y, Y ) for all t. The geodesics in (M, g) that are integral lines of Y will be called\nvertical.\nLet us show that, given a Lorentzian manifold (M, g) admitting a timelike Killing vector\nfield Y , the transversality condition may fail to hold along vertical geodesics in the class\nof all Lorentzian metrics on M that have the prescribed field Y as timelike Killing vector\nfield. A stationary Lorentzian manifold (M, g) is said to be standard if M is given by a\nproduct M0 \u00d7 R, where M0 is a differentiable manifold, and the metric tensor g is of the\nform:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(4.12)\ng(x,s) (v, r), (v\u0304, r\u0304) = gx (v, v\u0304) + gx \u03b4(x), v r\u0304 + gx \u03b4(x), v\u0304 r \u2212 \u03b2(x)rr\u0304,\nwhere x \u2208 M0 , s \u2208 R, v, v\u0304 \u2208 Tx M0 , r, r\u0304 \u2208 Ts R \u223c\n= R, g is a Riemannian metric tensor on\nM0 , \u03b4 \u2208 X(M0 ) is a smooth vector field on M0 , and \u03b2 : M0 \u2192 R+ is a smooth positive\nfunction on M0 . The field Y = \u2202s tangent to the lines {x0 } \u00d7 R, x0 \u2208 M0 , is a timelike\nKilling vector field in (M, g); an immediate computation shows that g(x,s) (Y, Y ) = \u2212\u03b2(x)\nfor all (x, s) \u2208 M0 \u00d7 R. Locally, every stationary Lorentzian metric tensor has the form\n(4.12). When the vector field \u03b4 in (4.12) vanishes identically on M0 , then the metric g is\nsaid to be standard static.\nLet \u2207 be the Levi\u2013Civita connection of the metric g in T M0 ; given a smooth map\nf0 : M0 \u2192 R, denote by \u2207f0 its gradient relatively to the metric g and by Hf0 (x) :\nTx M0 \u2192 Tx M0 , x \u2208 M0 , the Hessian of f0 relatively to g at the point x, which is the\ngx -symmetric linear operator on Tx M0 given by\u0001Hf0 (x)v = \u2207v (\u2207f0 ), for all v \u2208 Tx M0 .\nIf x is a critical point of f0 , then gx Hf0 (x)v, w\u0001 = d2 f0 (x)(v, w) is the standard second\nderivative of f0 at x. A curve \u03b3(t) = x(t), s(t) in M is a geodesic relatively to the metric\n(4.12) if and only if its components x and s satisfy the system of differential equations:\n\u0001\n\u0003\nd\u0002\n\u22c6\n2\nD\n1\nD\ngx \u03b4(x), \u1e8b \u2212 \u03b2(x) \u1e61 = 0,\ndt \u1e8b + dt (\u1e61 \u03b4) \u2212 \u1e61 (\u2207\u03b4) (\u1e8b) + 2 \u2207\u03b2(x) \u1e61 = 0,\ndt\n\nD\ndenotes covariant differentiation along x relatively\n\u2207, and\nwhere dt\n\u0001 to the connection\n\u0001\n\u22c6\n(\u2207\u03b4) is the (1, 1)-tensor on M defined by g (\u2207\u03b4)\u22c6 (v), w = g \u2207w \u03b4, w for all v, w \u2208\nT M . As observed above, if x0 is a critical point of \u03b2, i.e., \u2207\u03b2(x0 ) = 0, then the curve\n\u03b3(t) = (x0 , t), t \u2208 [0, 1], is a geodesic in (M, g).\nLet us consider for simplicity the static case, i.e., \u03b4 \u2261 0.

In the above formula and in the rest of\nthe section we will denote by a dot the derivatives of the components x and s of the curve\n\u03b3, and with a prime the derivatives of the component \u03c3 of the vector field V = (\u03be, \u03c3) along\n\u03b3. A pair (\u03be, \u03c3) is a Jacobi field along the geodesic \u03b3 = (x, s) if it satisfies the second\norder linear system of differential equations:\n(4.13)\n\nD2\ndt2\n\n\u03be \u2212 R(\u1e8b, \u03be) \u1e8b + \u03c3 \u2032 \u1e61 \u2207\u03b2(x) + 21 \u1e612 H\u03b2 (x)\u03be = 0,\n\nand\n(4.14)\n\nd\ndt\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0001\ng \u1e61 g \u2207\u03b2(x), \u03be + \u03b2(x) \u03c3 \u2032 = 0.\n\nIn order to construct the required example, let us consider a geodesic of the form \u03b3(t) =\n(x0 , t), t \u2208 [0, 1], where x0 \u2208 M0 is a critical point of \u03b2.

Note that\nD\n\u03be in this case equals the standard derivative \u03be \u2032 . Assume that this\nthe covariant derivative dt\nR1\nequation has a non trivial solution \u03be satisfying \u03be(0) = \u03be(1) = 0 and 0 \u03be(t) dt = 0. For\ninstance, one can take M0 = R, x0 = 0 and \u03b2(x) = 1 + 4\u03c0 2 x2 ; then, 12 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 (0) = 8\u03c0 2 , and\nthe differential equation \u03be \u2032\u2032 + 4\u03c0 2 \u03be = 0 has the solution \u03be(t) = sin(2\u03c0t) with the required\nproperties. Similar examples can be given easily in higher dimensions.\nAn infinitesimal variation h of g in the class of stationary metrics on M of the type\n(4.12) has the form:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(4.15)\nh(x,s) (v, r), (v\u0304, r\u0304) = hx (v, v\u0304) + gx \u03c1(x), v r\u0304 + gx \u03c1(x), v\u0304 r + \u03b6(x)rr\u0304,\nwhere x \u2208 M0 , s \u2208 R, v, v\u0304 \u2208 Tx M0 , r, r\u0304 \u2208 Ts R \u223c\n= R, h is a symmetric (0, 2)-tensor on\nM0 , \u03c1 \u2208 X(M0 ) is a smooth vector field on M0 , and \u03b6 : M0 \u2192 R is a smooth function\n\u0003\nR1\u0002\nD\non M0 .

G ENERICITY\n\nIN THE\n\nC\u221e\n\nCATEGORY\n\nIt is desirable to have a genericity result also in the space of C \u221e -metric tensors, endowed with the Whitney weak C \u221e topology (see for instance [18]). When the base manifold is non compact, the space of all symmetric tensors, endowed with the topology of C \u221e\nconvergence on compact sets, is a only a Frechet space, so that our Banach space approach\ndoes not apply directly. However, as it was brought to the attention of the authors by the\nreferee, there is an elegant argument due to Taubes that allows to extend to the C \u221e realm\nour results. The same idea was used in [14], which is where the authors learned about it;\nwe will sketch here the argument adapted to our situation.\nConsider a differentiable manifold M , a complete Riemannian metric gR on M , two\ndistinct points p, q \u2208 M , consider the sequence E k = \u0393ksym (T M \u2217 \u2297 T M \u2217 ; gR ) of C k Whitney type Banach space of tensor fields on M described in Example 1, Subsection 4.1.\n\u221e\nNote that the set of\nin each E k .

We will think of E as a Frechet space\nendowed with the family of seminorms k * kk defined in (4.1). In particular, E \u221e is a Baire\nspace, i.e., the intersection of a countable family of dense open subsets is dense.\nLet k0 \u2265 2 be fixed, and let A be an open subset of E k0 consisting of nondegenerate\ntensors, i.e., semi-Riemannian metrics on M . For k \u2265 k0 , set Ak = A\u2229E k ; this is an open\nsubset of E k . Define A\u2217 to be the subset of A consisting of all metric tensors for which\nall geodesics connecting p and q are nondegenerate. By assumption Ak,\u2217\nT = A\u2217 \u2229 Ak is a\ngeneric subset of Ak for all k \u2265 k0 . Finally, define A\u221e = A \u2229 E \u221e = k\u2265k0 Ak \u2282 E \u221e ,\nwhich is a dense subset of Ak for all k, and set A\u221e,\u2217 = A\u2217 \u2229 A\u221e . Note that A\u221e is an\n\n\f22\n\nL. BILIOTTI, M. A. JAVALOYES, AND P. PICCIONE\n\nopen subset of E \u221e , and thus it is also a Baire space; convergence in A\u221e implies C \u221e convergence on compact subsets of M . We want to prove that A\u221e,\u2217 is generic in A\u221e . To\nthis aim, denote by LR the length functional of curves relative to the Riemannian metric\ngR ; for all M > 0 define the following sets:\nAk,\u2217,M =\n\b\ng \u2208 Ak : all g-geodesic \u03b3 connecting p and q, with LR (\u03b3) \u2264 M , are nondegerate ,\n\nand\n\nA\u221e,\u2217,M =\n\n\\\n\nAk,\u2217,M .\n\nk\u2265k0\n\nT\u221e\nClearly, A\u221e,\u2217 = M=1 A\u221e,\u2217,M , thus, to prove our claim it suffices to show that A\u221e,\u2217,M\nis open and dense in A\u221e . The key observation is that for all k and M , Ak,\u2217,M is open\nin Ak . This follows from the following argument. Assume that gn \u2208 Ak \\ Ak,\u2217,M is a\nsequence converging to some g\u221e \u2208 Ak . Then, there exists a sequence \u03b3n : [0, 1] \u2192 M\nof gn -geodesics connecting p and q, with LR (\u03b3n ) \u2264 M for all n, and such that there is a\nnon trivial gn -Jacobi field Jn along \u03b3n with Jn (0) = Jn (1) = 0 for all n. Each Jn can be\nnormalized so that\nDgn\nJn (0) = 1\n(5.1)\ndt\ngn\n\nfor all n; here Ddt Jn is the covariant derivative of Jn along \u03b3n relatively to the Levi\u2013\nCivita connection of gn . Using the completeness of gR , by the theorem of Arzel\u00e1 and\nAscoli, we can assume that the sequence \u03b3n converges to a curve \u03b3\u221e connecting p and q;\nan immediate continuity argument shows that \u03b3\u221e is a g\u221e -geodesic with LR (\u03b3\u221e ) \u2264 M .\ngn\nBy (5.1), we can also assume that the sequence vn = Ddt J(0) \u2208 Tp M is convergent to\nsome v\u221e 6= 0. By continuity, the g\u221e -Jacobi field J\u221e along \u03b3\u221e satisfying J\u221e (0) = 0\ng\u221e\nand Ddt J\u221e (0) = v\u221e also satisfies J\u221e (1) = 0, i.e., \u03b3\u221e is a degenerate g\u221e -geodesic\nconnecting p and q, and g\u221e 6\u2208 Ak,\u2217,M . This shows that Ak,\u2217,M is open in Ak for every\nM > 0 and k \u2208 N \u222a {+\u221e}. Moreover, since Ak,\u2217,M contains Ak,\u2217 , then Ak,\u2217,M is also\ndense in Ak for all M . Finally, since A\u221e is dense in Ak and Ak,\u2217,M is open and dense in\nAk , then A\u221e \u2229 Ak,\u2217,M = A\u221e,\u2217,M is dense in Ak for all k, and thus A\u221e,\u2217,M is dense in\nA\u221e . This proves the genericity result in the C \u221e -category. Analogous results hold in all\nthe cases discussed in Section 4.\n6. A FEW\n\nFINAL REMARKS AND OPEN PROBLEMS\n\nLet us conclude with a few observations.\nFirst, one should observe that the genericity result for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian\nmanifolds stated in Subsection 4.5 is far from being conclusive, or exhaustive. Note for\ninstance that Proposition 4.8 does not apply to sets containing metric tensors g \u03b1,\u03b2 with\n\u03b2 an unbounded function on M . Several different statements of the genericity result are\npossible by the very same argument, simply by selecting the appropriate set of tensors and\nits Banach space structure that one wants to consider. It should also be mentioned that\nsomewhat stronger genericity results may be obtained by relaxing the global hyperbolicity\ncondition given in (4.11), in that the inequality may be required to hold in smaller regions\nof the spacetime. For instance, in [2] it is given a condition on the first derivative of the\nmetric coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 implying that all the geodesics between the prescribed points\np and q remain in a time-limited region of the spacetime. However, such stronger results\nwould certainly have a more involved statement, filled with technicalities that are probably\nnot appropriate for the purposes of the present paper. The interested reader will have no\nproblem in adapting the arguments in the proof of Proposition 4.8 to other specific cases.\nAs to the stationary Lorentzian case (Subsection 4.6), the negative result given by the\ncounterexample exhibited opens several interesting questions and conjectures that deserve\n\n\fGENERICITY OF NONDEGENERATE CRITICAL POINTS\n\n23\n\nfurther attention. First, it is natural to conjecture that, apart from vertical geodesics, stationary infinitesimal perturbations of the metric would suffice to destroy degeneracies. Should\nthis be the case, than a genericity result may be obtained by considering points p and q that\ndo not belong to the same integral line of the Killing vector field. A proof for the existence\nof appropriate infinitesimal perturbations would have to based on the following conjecture:\ngiven a non vertical geodesic \u03b3 = (x, s) and a nontrivial Jacobi field J = (\u03be, \u03c4 ) along \u03b3\nvanishing at the endpoints, then at some instants t, the vector \u03be(t) is not parallel to \u1e8b(t). A\ndirect proof of this fact, based on the Jacobi differential equations (4.13) and (4.14), seems\nto be rather involved, so that a suitable version of Lemma 2.5 would have to be proven.\nAnother interesting point would be to determine the genericity of the nondegeneracy property in the stationary Lorentzian case if one allows that also the Killing vector field Y may\nbe perturbed. We conjecture that the genericity property in this case would hold under no\nrestrictions on the endpoint.\nFinally, we would like to mention the case of closed geodesics, which is substantially\nmore involved than the fixed endpoint case. Let us recall that the first statement of the\nRiemannian bumpy theorem is due to Abraham, see [4], but to the authors' knowledge the\nfirst complete proof of it is due to Anosov, see [6]. A very interesting observation is that\na similar result does not hold for a general conservative Hamiltonian system, where one\ncan have degenerate periodic orbits that are not destroyed by small perturbations, as shown\nin [22]. Significative improvements of the bumpy metric theorem have been proven later\nby Klingenberg and Takens [21], who have shown genericity of the set of metrics with the\nproperty that the Poincar\u00e9 map of every closed geodesic and all its derivatives up to a finite\norder belong to a prescribed open and dense subset of the space of jets of symplectic maps\naround a fixed point.\nAs we have observed, the theory developed in this paper does not work in order to\nprove a genericity result for closed geodesics: iterates cannot be dealt with the perturbation\narguments discussed. Although parts of Anosov's proof of the bumpy metric theorem in\n[6] can be carried over to the semi-Riemannian case (namely, all the properties depending\non the linearized Poincar\u00e9 map), the positive definite character of Anosov's argument in\nsome parts of the proof cannot be extended directly to the semi-Riemannian case. For\ninstance, it is used in [6] a certain lower bound on the length of closed geodesics for all\nRiemannian metrics in a neighborhood of a given one; such bound certainly does not exist\noutside the Riemannian realm. A natural conjecture, or more exactly a wishful thinking at\nthis stage, is that bumpy metrics may be generic in sets of Lorentzian metrics satisfying\nrestrictive causality and geometric assumptions. A natural guess would be starting with\nthe stationary and globally hyperbolic case, where all closed geodesics are spacelike, and\nrecent developments of the variational geodesic theory (refs. [11, 12]) indicate a certain\nRiemannian behavior of the geodesic flow.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] A. A BBONDANDOLO , P. M AJER, A Morse complex for infinite dimensional manifolds. I, Adv.
