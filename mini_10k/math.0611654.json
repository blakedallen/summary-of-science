Magdalena Rodr\u0131\u0301guez\nSeptember 2, 2018\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1835, Scherk [11] showed a singly periodic minimal surface S in R3 , which\nmay be viewed as the desingularization of two vertical planes meeting at\na right angle. This surface S was generalized later on to a one-parameter\nfamily of singly periodic minimal surfaces S\u03b8 in R3 , where \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ] is the\nangle between the asymptotic vertical planes (in particular, S = S \u03c02 ). In\nthe quotient by its shortest period vector, each S\u03b8 has genus zero and four\nends asymptotic to flat vertical annuli. Annular ends of this kind are called\nScherk-type ends. These singly periodic Scherk minimal surfaces have recently been classified in [6] as the only properly embedded singly periodic\nminimal surfaces with four Scherk-type ends in the quotient.\nH. Karcher [2] generalized the previous Scherk minimal surfaces by constructing, for each natural n \u2265 2, a (2n \u2212 3)-parameter family of singly\nperiodic minimal surfaces with genus zero and 2n Scherk-type ends in the\nquotient. These surfaces, called saddle towers, are the only properly embedded singly periodic minimal surfaces in R3 with genus zero and finitely many\nScherk-type ends in the quotient, see [7]. Note that for n = 2 we obtain the\nsingly periodic Scherk minimal surfaces.\nLet us now recall the construction of the saddle towers: consider any\nconvex polygonal domain \u03a9n whose boundary consists of 2n edges of length\none, with n \u2265 2, and mark its edges alternately by \u00b1\u221e. Assume \u03a9n is\nnon-special (see definition 1 below). By a theorem of Jenkins and Serrin [1],\nthere exists a function un which solves the Jenkins-Serrin problem on \u03a9n ; i.e.\nun is a minimal graph defined on \u03a9n which diverges to \u00b1\u221e, as indicated by\nthe marking, when we approach to the edges of \u03a9n . The boundary of this\n1\n\n\fminimal graph consists of 2n vertical lines above the vertices of \u03a9n . Hence\nthe conjugate minimal surface of this graph is bounded by 2n horizontal\nsymmetry curves, lying in two horizontal planes at distance 1 from each\nother. By reflecting about one of the two symmetry planes, we obtain a\nfundamental domain for a saddle tower Mn with period T = (0, 0, 2) and 2n\nScherk-type ends in the quotient.\nDefinition 1 We say that a convex polygonal domain with 2n unitary edges\nis special if n \u2265 3 and its boundary is a parallelogram with two sides of length\none and two sides of length n \u2212 1.\nRemark 1 ([3]) The bounded convex polygonal domains with edges of length\none which fail to satisfy the hypothesis of the theorem of Jenkins and Serrin [1] are precisely the special domains.\nIn this paper we study the possible limits of saddle towers by taking\nlimits of sequences of minimal graphs un as above. We normalize so that the\nsegment of vertices (0, 0), (1, 0) is one of the edges of the convex polygonal\ndomain \u03a9n where un is defined, and such edge is marked by +\u221e.\nTheorem 1 Let Mn \u2282 R3 be a saddle tower with 2n Scherk-type ends in\nthe quotient, and \u03a9n be its associated normalized convex polygonal domain\nin the above construction. Suppose {\u03a9n }n does not converge to a straight\nline nor half a straight line. Then a subsequence of {Mn }n converges uniformly on compact sets of R3 with multiplicity one to either one of the saddle\ntowers with infinitely many ends described in [3], any singly periodic Scherk\nminimal surface, a doubly periodic Scherk minimal surface of angle \u03c02 , or a\nKMR example M\u03b8,\u03b1,0 studied in [9] (also called toroidal halfplane layer by\nKarcher [2]).\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we present some general results for minimal graphs explained\nin [3] and based on the ideas of Jenkins and Serrin, developed by Collin and\nMazet.\n\n2\n\n\fLet u = u(x1 , x2 ) be a solution of the minimal graph equation,\n!\n\u2207u\n= 0,\ndiv p\n1 + |\u2207u|2\n\n(1)\n\ndefined on a domain \u03a9 \u2282 R2 . By an elementary computation, we obtain\nu\nu\nthat the form d\u03c8u = \u221a x1 2 dx2 \u2212 \u221a x2 2 dx1 is closed. Hence it defines a\n1+|\u2207u|\n\n1+|\u2207u|\n\nfunction \u03c8u = \u03c8u (x1 , x2 ), called conjugate function of u, which is well defined\nup to an additive constant. In fact, \u03c8u coincides with the third coordinate\nfunction of the conjugate minimal surface of the graph of u, written as a\nfunction on the (x1 , x2 )-parameters (although such conjugate surface does\nnot coincide with the graph of \u03c8u ). It is straightforward to check that \u03c8u\nis a Lipschitz function, in particular it can be extended continuously to \u2202\u03a9.\nMoreover, the following lemma holds.\nLemma 1 Given a solution u of (1) on a domain \u03a9 \u2282 R2 , we have:\nR\n(i) For every domain D \u2282 \u03a9, \u2202D d\u03c8u = 0.\n(ii) Let T \u2282 \u2202\u03a9 be a bounded arc oriented as \u2202D. Then,\nZ\nd\u03c8u \u2264 |T |,\nT\n\nR\n\nand T d\u03c8u = |T | (resp. \u2212|T |) if and only if u diverges to +\u221e (resp. to\n\u2212\u221e) as one approaches T within \u03a9, in which case T must be a straight\nsegment.\nLet un be a solution of (1) on a domain \u03a9n \u2282 R2 . We define the limit\ndomain \u03a9\u221e of the domains \u03a9n as the set of points in R2 that admit a neighborhood contained in every \u03a9n , for n large enough, and say that {\u03a9n }n\nconverges to \u03a9\u221e . Consider the convergence domain of {un }n , defined as\nB(un ) = {p \u2208 \u03a9\u221e | {|\u2207un |(p)}n is bounded } .\nFor each component D of B(un ) and any point q \u2208 D, there is a subsequence\nof {un \u2212 un (qn )}n converging uniformly on compact sets of D to a solution\nof (1), where qn \u2208 \u03a9n with qn \u2192 q. Moreover,\n\u03a9\u221e \u2212 B(un ) = \u222ai\u2208I Li ,\n3\n\n\fwhere each Li , called a divergence line, is a component of the intersection of a\nstraight line with \u03a9\u221e . Clearly, to ensure the convergence of a subsequence of\nthe vertical translated un on \u03a9\u221e , it suffices to prove there are no divergence\nlines.\nLemma 2 Let {un }n be a sequence of minimal graphs as above, and denote\nby \u03c8n the conjugate function of un , for every n \u2208 N.\n(i) Let T be a straight segment\ncontained in a divergence line, T \u2282 \u03a9n for\nR\nn big enough. Then T d\u03c8n \u2192 \u00b1|T |.\n\n(ii) A divergence line cannot finish at an interior point of an open straight\nsegment T \u2282 \u2202\u03a9\u221e , if for each n there exists a straight segment Tn in\n\u03a9n such that un diverges to +\u221e when we approach Tn within \u03a9n and\nTn \u2192 T .\nFinally, we have the following uniqueness result for the limit u under some\nconstraints.\nLemma 3 ([4]) Let u, v be two solutions of (1) in a domain \u03a9, whose conjugate functions \u03c8u , \u03c8v are bounded in \u03a9 and coincide in \u2202\u03a9. Then u \u2212 v is\nconstant in \u03a9.\n\n3\n\nTaking limits of saddle towers\n\nFor every n \u2208 N, let \u03a9n \u2282 R2 be a non-special, convex, bounded polygonal\ndomain with 2n unitary edges. Denote its vertices as pni , i = 0, * * * , 2n \u2212 1,\nby following the natural cyclic ordering induced by the positive orientation\nof \u2202\u03a9n . Assume that pn0 = (0, 0) and pn1 = (1, 0) for every n \u2208 N. After\npassing to a subsequence, the sequence of domains {\u03a9n }n converges to either\na straight line, half a straight line, or a convex, unbounded, polygonal domain\n\u03a9\u221e with unitary edges, whose vertices are obtained as limits of the vertices\nof the domains \u03a9n . Assume that the two first cases do not happen.\nLet un be the solution to the minimal graph equation (1) on \u03a9n which\ntakes boundary values +\u221e on the edges (pn2i , pn2i+1 ), and \u2212\u221e on the edges\n(pn2i\u22121 , pn2i ), i = 0, * * * , n \u2212 1. Our aim consists of studying the possible limits\nfor {un }n .\n4\n\n\fWe denote by \u03c8n the conjugate function of un verifying \u03c8n (pn0 ) = 0. From\nR pn\nLemma 1-(ii) we have pnii+1 d\u03c8n = (\u22121)i , which implies that \u03c8n (pni ) is equal\nto 0 if i is even, and equal to 1 when i is odd. Moreover, \u03c8n is an affine\nfunction on each edge of \u03a9n , so 0 \u2264 \u03c8n \u2264 1 on \u2202\u03a9n . And by the maximum\nprinciple, 0 \u2264 \u03c8n \u2264 1 in \u03a9n .\nFinally, we will say that a vertex of \u03a9\u221e is even (resp. odd) if it is obtained\nas limit of vertices pn2i (resp. pn2i+1 ) of the domains \u03a9n , where i = 0, * * * , 2n\u22121\n(this is possible because we have fixed the vertices pn0 , pn1 ). In particular,\np0 = (0, 0) is an even vertex of \u03a9\u221e , and p1 = (1, 0) is an odd vertex.\nProposition 1 If the distance between any two vertices of \u03a9\u221e with different\nparity is strictly bigger than one, and qn \u2208 \u03a9n with qn \u2192 q \u2208 \u03a9\u221e , then\n{un \u2212 un (qn )}n converges to a minimal graph u\u221e with boundary values \u00b1\u221e\ndisposed alternately on \u2202\u03a9\u221e and whose conjugate graph lies in the horizontal\nslab {(x1 , x2 , x3 ) | 0 \u2264 x3 \u2264 1}.\nProof. Let us prove there are no divergence lines for {un }n in the setting of\nProposition 1. Suppose by contradiction that there exists one such divergence\nline L. We deduce from Lemma 2-(i) that L must have length no bigger than\none, since 0 \u2264 \u03c8n \u2264 1 for every n \u2208 N. Thus Lemma 2-(ii) says that L must\nbe a segment (of length at most one) joining two different vertices pi , pj\nof \u03a9\u221e . Let pni , pnj be vertices of \u03a9n such that pni \u2192 pi and pnj \u2192 pj . Since\nR pn\nR pn\n| pnij d\u03c8n | \u2192 |pi \u2212pj | by using Lemma 2-(i), but | pnij d\u03c8n | = |\u03c8n (pnj )\u2212\u03c8n (pni )|\ncan only equal 0 or 1, we deduce that the only possibility is |pi \u2212 pj | = 1, and\nso |\u03c8n (pnj ) \u2212 \u03c8n (pni )| = 1 for n large. In particular, the vertices pi , pj have\ndifferent parity and satisfy |pi \u2212 pj | = 1, which contradicts the hypothesis in\nProposition 1.\nHence there exists a subsequence of {un \u2212un (qn )}n converging on compact\nsubsets of \u03a9\u221e to a minimal graph u\u221e . Moreover, we deduce from Lemma 1(ii) that u\u221e takes boundary values \u00b1\u221e alternately on the unitary edges in\n\u2202\u03a9\u221e . Since the conjugate function \u03c8\u221e of u\u221e can be obtained as limit of\n{\u03c8n }n , we deduce that 0 \u2264 \u03c8\u221e \u2264 1 on \u03a9\u221e .\nFinally, we obtain from Lemma 3 that it is not only a subsequence but\nthe whole sequence {un \u2212 un (qn )}n what converges to u\u221e , and Proposition 1\nis proven.\n\n5\n\n\fRemark 2 From Lemma 3, we know that the graph u\u221e obtained in Proposition 1 must be half a singly periodic Scherk minimal surface of angle \u03c02 , if\n\u03a9\u221e is a halfplane; one of the graphs studied in [8] (i.e. a piece of a KMR\nexample M\u03b8,\u03b1, \u03c02 ), if the limit domain \u03a9\u221e is a strip; or one of the graphs\nconstructed in [3], in other case.\nNow suppose we are not in the setting of Proposition 1; this is, suppose\nthere exist two vertices pi , pj of \u03a9\u221e with different parity such that 0 6=\n|pi \u2212 pj | \u2264 1. It is not very difficult to check that \u03a9\u221e must be either a strip\nor a special, unbounded, convex polygonal domain, see Definition 2 below.\nDefinition 2 An unbounded convex polygonal domain is said to be special\nwhen its boundary is made of two parallel half lines and one edge of length\none (such a domain may be seen as a limit of special domains with 2n edges,\nwhen n \u2192 \u221e), see Figure 1.\nLet pnin , pnjn be two vertices of \u03a9n such that pnin \u2192 pi and pnjn \u2192 pj . Assume pi is an even vertex and pj is an odd vertex. Then \u03c8n (pnin ) = 0 and\nR pn\n\u03c8n (pnjn ) = 1, so | pnijn d\u03c8n | = 1. Thus we deduce from Lemma 1-(ii) that\nn\nthe straight segment (pi , pj ) is a divergence line. Moreover, we can similarly\nprove that, if pnin +1 , pnjn \u22121 (resp. pnin \u22121 , pnjn+1 ) are not consecutive vertices\nand for each index \u03b1 we denote by p\u03b1 the vertex of \u03a9\u221e so that pn\u03b1n \u2192 p\u03b1 ,\nthen the straight segment (pi+1 , pj\u22121) (resp. (pi\u22121 , pj+1 )) is a divergence line.\nFollowing this reasoning we obtain that the convergence domain B(un ) consists of consecutive translated rhombi with unitary edges (see Figure 1). By\nuniqueness we know that, after a suitable vertical translation, the graphs un\nconverge on each such rhombus to a fundamental piece of a doubly periodic\nScherk minimal surface. We then obtain the following lemma.\nLemma 4 If \u03a9\u221e is a special domain, the convergence domain of {un }n consists of consecutive translated rhombi R1 , R2 , . . . with unitary edges. Moreover, given q \u2208 Rk for some k = 1, 2, . . ., the sequence {un \u2212un (q)}n converges\nuniformly on compact sets of Rk to a fundamental piece of a doubly periodic\nScherk minimal surface.\nFor each n \u2208 N, let Mn be the saddle tower obtained from the graph un .\nTranslate each Mn so that it contains the origin of R3 , and let us now prove\n6\n\n\fFigure 1: An example of special, unbounded, convex polygonal domain.\nthat {Mn }n converges with finite multiplicity on compact sets of R3 to a\nminimal surface M\u221e . Since we are assuming that \u03a9\u221e is not half a straight\nline nor a straight line, there exists a uniform radius r0 > 0 such that, for\neach vertex pni of \u03a9n , the disk D(pni , r0 ) intersects \u2202\u03a9n only along its two\nedges with common endpoint pni . We can then prove as in [3], Section 4, that\nthere exists a constant C (independent of n) such that the Gauss curvature\nof Mn is bounded by C. By the Regular Neighborhood Theorem, or Rolling\n\u221a\nLemma [10, 5], Mn has an embedded tubular neighborhood of radius 1/ C.\nIn particular, we have\n\u221a local area bounds (more precisely, the area of Mn inside\nballs of radius 1/ C is bounded by some constant). By standard result, a\nsubsequence of {Mn }n converges with finite multiplicity on compact subsets\nof R3 to a minimal surface M\u221e .\nFrom Proposition 1, Remark 2 and Lemma 4, we obtain that M\u221e must\nbe the conjugate surface of the corresponding limit of the graphs un , i.e. a\nKMR example M\u03b8,\u03b1,0 , a singly or doubly periodic Scherk minimal surface,\nor one of the examples constructed in [3], which are singly periodic minimal\nsurfaces with genus zero and one limit end in the quotient by all their periods.\nFurthermore, sin M\u221e is not a plane, the multiplicity of convergence is one.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nRemark 3 When the domains \u03a9n converges to either a straight line or half\na straight line, it may be proven that the Gauss curvature of the saddle towers\nMn blows-up. And, after scaling to have curvature estimates, the graphs un\nconverge to half a helicoid (see [8] for a description of this limit). In fact,\nthis is the same helicoidal limit we obtain by taking limits from fundamental\npieces of doubly periodic Scherk minimal surfaces. Hence the scaled saddle\ntowers converge to a catenoid.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] H. Jenkins and J. Serrin. Variational problems of minimal surface type\nII.
