I NTRODUCTION\nUnderwater exploration represents a very important economic, technologic and scientific challenge. This is closely\nrelated to Arctic and Antarctic offshore resources, pollution monitoring, general oceanographic data collection and,\nrecently, to underwater actuation [1]. Due to very large\nunderwater areas and high damping properties of water,\napplication of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles\n(AUVs) in cooperative missions seems very promising [2].\nFor application of AUVs in networked or swarm mode,\nthere is a number of crucial issues: underwater sensing\nand communication (S&C), cooperation and mission control,\ndesign of AUV platforms, autonomous behavior and several\ncollective aspects of running multiple AUVs. In this work\nwe concentrate on minimalistic local S&C [3], and related\ncoordination strategies, being motivated by the following\nreasons [4].\nIn several past and running projects devoted to underwater\nswarms, such as AquaJelly [5], Angels [6], CoCoRo [7],\na number of AUV platforms and sensing technologies has\nbeen developed. These works indicated two important issues:\na successful AUV platform needs a dedicated combination\nof different S&C technologies, moreover capabilities of\nunderwater cooperation depends on the level of embodiment\n[8] of on-board S&C systems. In several cases, even a simple\nmulti-modal signal system leads to advanced cooperation [9]\n(see e.g. the case of multi-agent cooperation [10]).\nSince swarm approaches rely primarily on local interactions between AUVs [11], the paper is devoted to local\nS&C systems (unmodulated and modulated IR/blue light, RF\nand electric field), which can be used for robot-robot/robotobject detection and provide sub-modal information, such as\ndirection and distances, as well as can be used for analog and\ndigital communication [12]. These systems, developed for\nInstitute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, University of Stuttgart,\nUniversit\u00e4tstr. 38, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany, emails {Serge.Kernbach, Tobias.Dipper, Donny.Sutantyo}@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de, pre-print version, published in Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Mobile Robots\nand Competitions, Robotica 2011, Lisbon, pp.96-101\n\neach of the platforms is described in Sec. III, whereas Sec. II\nprovides general overview over different S&C technologies.\nIn Sec. IV we shortly sketch a few behavioral experiments\nwith these systems and finally in Sec. V conclude about\nuseful combinations of S&C and their embodiment for\ncollective underwater systems.\nII. C OMPARISON OF DIFFERENT S&C SYSTEMS\nIn this section we give a short overview over different\nstate-of-the-art S&C systems in an underwater environment,\nsee e.g. [13]-[14]. Four systems will be compared:\n\u2022 Sonar: Sonic waves travel very well under water and\nthe energy and build-space required for generating and\nreceiving them is very low. This approach is used in\nso-called acoustic modems [15]. Drawbacks of this\napproach are, firstly, the relatively low sound travel\nspeed of roughly 1500 m/s (much slower than any\nother S&C system), and, secondly, multiple reflections\ncausing essential distortions in the signal.\n\u2022 Radio: Electromagnetic waves are a standard communication method in air; its application under water creates\nseveral problems [16]. Due to water connectivity, the\nattenuation of radio waves depends on the used frequency, which in turn results in the size of antenna. High\nfrequencies (> 100 MHz) only need a small antenna\n(0.1 m) while their range is restricted to 2.5 m. Lower\nfrequencies (100 kHz) have a long range (100 m), but\nneed a large antenna (100 m).\n\u2022 Optical: Using light as a communication channel can\nprovide a compact size of transmitting equipment and\nacceptable range [14]. Due to the color dependent\nattenuation of light in water, the communication range\nvaries between a few centimeters in IR spectra and\nincreases to over a meter by using blue or green light.\n\u2022 Electric Field: This is a new communication approach.\nIt bases upon generating and measuring electric fields.\nThe build-size and energy required for this system is\nvery small. Unfortunately the attenuation of electric\nfields is very high, liming the range of this communication channel to less than 1 m. We will discuss this\napproach in Sec. IV-B.\nTable I shows an overview of the discussed approaches.\nSince the used AUVs operate in a swarm mode [17] (large\nnumber of AUVs, full decentralization, utilization of swarm\napproaches for coordination [18], application of evolutionary\napproaches [19], [20]), in this paper we concentrate on a\nlocal S&C approaches. The S&C is defined as local, when\nthe communication range Rc (i.e. communication volume\n\n\fChannel\nSonar (30 kHz)\nRadio (100 kHz)\nRadio (1 MHz)\nRadio (100 MHz)\nOptical unmodul.

Local\ncommunication range Rc can be approximated by\ns\nVsw\n,\n(1)\nRc =3\nN 4/3\u03c0\nwhere for Vsw = 5m3 and N = 20, Rc is about 0,4m. For the\nplatform size 10-15cm, this results in 3 to 4 times the robot\nlength. Generalizing the AUV size up to 50cm, we assume\nthat Rcl within 0,5-1,2m are local, whereas Rcg capable to\ncover the whole Vsw , i.e. 3-4m, are global. In the following\nsections we consider the developed optical and electric field\nS&C approaches which are related to Rcl .\n\nallows an inclined vertical movement). Due to visual effects,\nwhich are one of the main developmental goals of this\nplatform, it was decided to use unmodulated blue light. Since\nseveral communication approaches should remain invisible\nfor human observers and to make the system more stable\nto different illumination conditions, it was decided to use\nadditionally 36kHz modulated IR light. The platform possesses also very sensitive pressure and temperature sensors,\n3D accelerometer and energy sensor (additional RF system\nwas used for a backup communication with the host). The\nenergy part consisted of 4A/h LiPo accumulator with a\npower management circuitry and Hot-Swap controller for\nunderwater recharging. Due to low energy consumption, the\nautonomy lies between several hours and with autonomous\nrecharging is theoretically unlimited.\n3D omni-directional communication and sensing was one\nof the main technical requirements. Blue light and IR sensors\nare used in different ways. Since IR light is more dumped\nin water, IR channels are very useful for a short range\ndirectional communication. Blue light channels are used as\nunidirectional system, which was mainly used for navigation\napproaches based on optical pheromone in the improved version of the platform. To enable directional communication,\nthe original platform has 11 IR emitters and receivers with\nintegrated PCM decoder, see Fig. 2.\n\nIII. L OCAL S&R APPROACHES\nA. Multi-modal Optical System\nAs the first developed approach for combined S&C within\nRcl , we describe a specific bi-modal directional optical\nsystem, which underlies cooperative behavior of AquaJelly\nrobots [5]. AquaJelly was a project between Festo AG &\nCo. KG (coordinator and founder), Effekt-Technik GmbH,\nand University of Stuttgart intended to create a swarm (N =\n20\u221230 robots) of autonomous underwater robots, capable of\nmulti-modal interactions and underwater recharging. Robots\nhave been developed and manufactured within a very short\ntime of 8 months in 2007-2008.\n\nFig. 2. (Top-left) Placement of IR and blue light LEDs in the top of the\nring; (Top-righ) Molded ring in white polyurethane; (Bottom) Experimental\nmeasurement for IR communication/sensing.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nAquaJelly robots.\n\nTechnical requirements define robot-robot, robot-dockingstation, and collisions recognition; cooperative collision\navoidance; several types of cooperative behavior around\ndocking station, and vertical movement of robots (robots\npossess only vertical DoF with a balancing mechanism; this\n\nSpatial displacement has an important role, so sidewise\nIR emitters and receivers are set up each 60 degrees and\nseparated through thick a black-colored PCB on TOP and\nBOTTOM sides. Three IR sensors are positioned down-side\nand two up-side. Six blue light LEDs are installed on the\ntop of the platform and through mate cover created almost a\nhomogeneous \"light ball\" around the robot. All 17 communication channels are independent from each other through\nan analog multiplexor. To make the platform waterproof, the\nring with all sensors was molded in polyurethane. Blue light\nsystem has been used in analog mode, whereas IR used\na digital PCM-modulated signal. All sensors are directly\n\n\fconnected to I/O pins of the Atmel MCU, which can provide\naround 8-10mA current at 3V, opening angle of all LEDs is\nabout 10 degrees. Communication range of modulated IR\nis about 0,5m, see Fig. 2. Due to passive PCM filter, the\ncommunication range was fixed on this distance and used in\n4kbps communication mode. Average range of the analog\nblue light system is about 1-1,3m and can be varied by\nregulating intensity and number of LEDs.\nThe main idea for using two different optical systems was\na split between analog gradient-based interactions between\nrobots (visible for human observer) and digital channels\nused for robot-objects interactions and for communication,\nwhich synchronizes internal states of robots and docking station (invisible for observers). Thus, a combination between\nanalog omni-directional \"long-range\" and digital directional\n\"short-range\" optical systems used in different modifications\nAquaJelly robots allowed a wide range of different sensing\nand communication approaches, which result in interesting\ncooperative behavior of these platforms, see Sec. IV.\nB. Modulated and Encoded Blue Light\nAs a further development of the S&C system, described\nin the previous section, we intend to use only one light\nsystem with modulated blue light for both robot-robot/object\ndetection, distance measurement and digital communication.\nDigital optical communication is widely used due to its\nhigh bandwidth. However, the absence of gradient-based\noptical guide for sensing and localization makes the digital\nsystem less suitable for navigation purposes. Therefore specific protocols are required to extract sub-modal information\nabout distances and orientation from the digital channel.\nThe table II shows our underwater measurement results\nthat compare the common modulated IR and blue light\ncommunication in many modulation types at the bandwidth\nof 119kbps.\nModulation\ndirect\nIrDA\nTV Remote\nQAM\ndirect\nIrDA\nTV Remote\nQAM\n\nTransducer\nInfra-red\nInfra-red\nInfra-red\nInfra-red\nBlue LED\nBlue LED\nBlue LED\nBlue LED\n\nMaximum Communication/Sensing\n-/7 cm / 0-5 cm\n5 cm / 0-5 cm\n12 cm / 0-5 cm\n20 cm / - / 60 cm / 0-5 cm\n45 cm / 3-8 cm\n120 cm / 7-12 cm\n\nTABLE II\nR ANGE OF UNDERWATER OPTICAL COMMUNICATION FOR 119 KBPS .\n\nAs a digital communication transceiver, the blue light\nsystem needs modulator, amplifier, signal conditioner, and\nprotocol encoder/decoder. The one chip solution can be\nsolved by using a CS 8130 IrDA chip from Cirrus Logic.\nSince the blue light system has a directional S&C, two channels are not sufficient for the swarm robot to communicate\nin every direction. The half duplex behavior of each channel\nmakes one channel unable to be applied for sensing, because\nthe sensing mechanism requires to transmit and to receive\nthe sensing signal in one time. Therefore, the position of\nthe transmitter and receiver are swapped with neighboring\nchannels for sensing application.\n\nThe system must be configured and calibrated for finding\nthe best modulation type for underwater communication\nand sensing. According to the measurement results, both\nfor communication and sensing, the Quadrature Amplitude\nModulation (QAM) seems to be the best modulation for\nunderwater application. Fig. 3(a) shows the relation between\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 3. (a) Distance measurement with QAM blue light; (b) Active Sensing\nAlgorithm.\n\ncurrent sensitivity and communication distance. By using\nthis curve, an active sensing algorithm can be added to the\ninter-robot communication algorithm by varying the amplification and the sensitivity of the programmable amplifier\nvia software, see Fig. 3(b). The robot can approximate\nthe distance with other robots by gradually decreasing the\ncurrent sensitivity while communicating each other. The\ndeveloped inter-robot communication algorithm has three\nphases. First, when two robots are in the communication\nrange, they begin to establish the communication by sending\ntheir IDs to each other. Second, the communicating robots\nare approximating their distance by gradually decreasing the\ncurrent sensitivity within the programmable gain amplifier.\nTherefore, after knowing their own position, behavioral or\ncooperation phased can be performed. A robot will continuously iterate the first phase if there is no other robots in the\ncommunication range. Hence an obstacle might reflect the\ntransmitted signal and the robot would receive back the first\nphase communication packet that contains its own ID.\nC. Electric Sense\nAfter experimenting with optical S&C systems, we implemented another approach, which is inspired by weakly\nelectric fish. These animals are capable of producing an\nelectric field which they can use for localisation and communication [6]. Here we try to use this bio-inspired approach\nfor analog communication and navigation in robot swarms.\nElectric fields. Electric charges generate electrical fields\nin their vicinity. Electric fields are vector fields. For a point\n~ can be calculated at each point\ncharge Q the field intensity E\n~r as\n~ = Q * ~r\n(2)\nE\n4\u03c0\u000f0 \u000fr r3\nwith the permittivities \u000f0 (vacuum) and \u000fr (relativ) [21].\nThe field vectors of multiple point charges follow the\nsuperposition principle. In our robot the electric field is generated by a dipole. The field intensity is proportional to the\ncharge in the electrodes, which themselves are proportional\nto the applied voltage to the electrodes:\nQ=C *U\n\n(3)\n\n\fwith the voltage U and the capacity C.\nCommunication. The intensity of an electric field can\nthen be detected by measuring the differential potential\nbetween two electrodes in the field. This potential is proportional to the electric field intensity, which itself is proportional to the output voltage of the sender. By modulating the\noutput voltage of the sender, information can be transmitted.\nLocalization. By using multiple pairs of electrodes in the\nreceiver it is possible to calculate the bearing and distance\nto the sender. This is achieved by utilizing the drop in\nfield intensity with relation to the distance. A sinus wave\nis impressed on the sender's electrodes which creates an\noscillating electrical field. The field intensity depends mainly\non the amplitude and frequency of the output voltage and\nsome environmental conditions. The amplitude in the field\nintensity at a specific point ~r is proportional to the amplitude\nof the output voltage:\n~r\n(4)\nr3\nwith the amplitude of the output signal ao and measured\ninput ai , the frequency \u03c9 and the time t.\nIf sender and receiver are approximately in the same plane\nand the electrodes have the same orientation (compare Fig.\n4 left) (4) can be simplified to:\nu(t) = ao * sin(\u03c9t) \u223c E(t) \u223c ai * sin(\u03c9t) *\n\nF (\u03c9)\n(5)\nr2\nwith the frequency dependent proportionality factor F (\u03c9)\nand the distance r between sender and receiver. Measuring\nthe sinus amplitude (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) at four points with\na specific geometrical pattern (Fig. 4 right) leads to the\nfollowing equations:\nao * sin(\u03c9t) = ai * sin(\u03c9t) *\n\na1 =\na3 =\n\nAo\nF (\u03c9)\nAo\nF (\u03c9)\n\n*\n*\n\n1\n(r\u2212s*cos \u03b1)2 ,\n1\n(r+s*cos \u03b1)2 ,\n\na2 =\na4 =\n\nAo\nF (\u03c9)\nAo\nF (\u03c9)\n\n*\n*\n\n1\n(r\u2212s*sin \u03b1)2\n1\n(r+s*sin \u03b1)2\n\n(6)\nsender\nr\n\ny\n\nreceiver\n1\nas\n2\n4\n\nx\n\n3\n\nDesign limitations. This approach has two design limitations: it requires the sender and receiver electrodes to have\nthe same orientation (i.e. vertical) and to be roughly in the\nsame plane (horizontal to the orientation):\n\u2022 The first limitation holds no practical difficulties. Our\nrobot maintains a specific orientation, caused by its\ncenter of gravity. By placing one of the sender and\nreceiver electrodes on top and one on the bottom of\nthe robot the orientation is always vertical.\n\u2022 The derivation above is only correct if sender and\nreceiver are on the same plane, which is horizontal to\nthe orientation of their electrodes. In a three dimensional\nenvironment this is not always true, but usually the\nworking space is wider than it is high, even in a 3D\nenvironment.\nEven so, we are working on overcoming these limitations.\nWe are confident that the second can be eliminated by\nrearranging the receiver electrodes. To overcome the first\nlimitation additional electrodes may be needed.\nIV. E XPERIMENTS\nAs described in the previous sections, different local S&C\nsystems utilize the same hardware components for sensing\nand communication. Moreover, they use modal and submodal approaches, which provide not only message transmission, but also deliver spatial information about position\nand distances of robots and objects. In this section we describe several behavioral experiments, performed with these\nsystems.\nA. Experiments with Bi-modal Optical System\nOne of the implemented scenarios with AquaJelly robots\nhad the following form, see Fig. 5. In water, a robot sends\nsequentially in all IR channels its own ID. Listening and\nsending times are selected as approx. 95% listening and 5%\nsending, so that all robots most of time silently observe the\nenvironment. Receiving another-than-own ID means meeting\nanother robot, whereas non-ID IR light means own reflection\nfrom passive objects. Granularity of IR channels is enough\nfor rough collision avoidance with objects, e.g. walls of\nthe aquarium. Collision avoidance based on digital channels\nare impossible for more than two robots (or robot and\nobject). In opposite, blue light channels emit almost all time.\n\nFig. 4. Position and orientation of sender and receiver electrodes, top-(left)\nand side-view (right)\n\nIn setting up these equations it is assumed that r >> s\nso that the error in the angle \u03b1 and distance r between the\ndifferent sensors is minimal. In (6) the proportional factor\nand output amplitude can be eliminated, under the condition\nof r > s leading to:\np\np\na1 /a3 + 1\na2 /a4 + 1\nr = s * cos \u03b1 p\n, r = s * sin \u03b1 p\n(7)\na1 /a3 \u2212 1\na2 /a4 \u2212 1\n|\n{z\n}\n|\n{z\n}\nu1\n\nand\n\u03b1 = arctan\n\nu2\n\nu1\nu2\n\n(8)\n\nFig. 5. Experiment with collective decision making during the docking\napproach.\n\nSince light has additive properties, when two robots meet\neach other, intensity of light in the point of light-spheresintersection creates a light gradient and can be locally\nsensed by both robots. Especially interesting is the light\n\n\fgradient when several robots meet each other; they create\ncomplex gradients, which can be used for precise multi-robot\nnavigation. Unfortunately, blue-light sensors continuously\nreceive signals from their own light sphere so that no efficient\ncommunication is possible in this mode.\nInitially all robots are fully charged. When a robot has\na low energy value, it swims up and recharges. With the\nprogress of experiment, more and more robots swim up for\nrecharging. In this way, several robots meet in the upper\npart of the aquarium and compete for the docking station,\nsee Fig. 5(from left to right). Since only a robot with\nlowest energy value should recharge, all robots bilaterally\nexchange values of their own energy level. The robot with\nthe lowest energy value can swim up. This local behavior\nleads to the following interesting collective behavior. Due\nto light gradient created by many robots, all robots exert\n\"optical pressure\" on each other, and collectively swim\ndown, whereas only one most \"hungry\" robot swims up and\nrecharges, see Fig. 5(right).\nB. Experiment with Encoded Blue Light\nIn order to investigate the modulated blue light S&C\nsystem, we used underwater submarine toy as a mechanical\nplatform with new electronic components for locomotion,\ncomputational and S&C capabilities. This submarine has\nthree degrees of freedom and three actuators for moving forward/backward, turning left/right, and diving up to 1 meter.\nThe necessary modifications of the submarine including the\nreplacement of the original electronic parts with the new\ndesigned electronic boards, and drilling some new holes\non the robot's body for communication/sensing transducers\nplacements. Cortex3 LM3S316 microcontroller with 25MHz\nof clock frequency, 16kb of internal flash ROM, and 16kb\nof RAM has been used in the platform. Two motor drivers\nand two navigational sensors are placed on the main board\nof the electronic platform. The combination of the available\nPWM output from Cortex3 and motor driver perform the\nability to control the swimming velocity via software. A\ndigital compass and pressure sensor are added as a threedimensional orientation sensor (an low-frequency RF part is\nforeseen for a backup communication with host).\n\ntype of optical characteristic, which create different reflection\nbehavior for the blue light. Therefore, white papers can be\nput outside the aquarium walls to increase the reflection\ncapability of the optical sensor.\nFor testing the communication and active sensing capabilities, one robot is deployed underwater and a static\nencoded blue light transceiver is installed on the aquarium\nwall as a measurement reference point, see Fig. 6(right).\nThe static transceiver can illuminate several type of light\nsignals if it receives a specific blue light packet data from the\nswimming robot. Different types of blinking signals are used\nto examine the functionality of the active sensing capability.\nThis approach underlies several other experiments, where\na few passive robots are identified by one active AUV as\nforaging targets.\nC. Experiment with Electric Field\nThe circuit for electric field communication is very simple.\nIt consists mainly of a digital-analog-converter (DAC) for\nthe sender and four amplifiers (OP) with analog-digitalconverters (ADC) for the receiver (Fig. 7).\n\u2022 Sender: The output of the 14-bit DAC is directly tied to\none of the sender electrodes while the other is connected\nto VCC/2. The electrodes are in direct contact with the\nsurrounding water. The output of the DAC can be set\nto a voltage between GND and VCC. This setup allows\ncontrol of the field intensity and polarity.\n\u2022 Receiver: The receiver has four pairs of electrodes in\nthe water to measure the difference in the potential\nof the electric field in four places. The electrodes use\ncapacitors as highpass-filters to filter DC signals. The\nsignals are amplified by differential OPs (magnitude\n1000) and digitized by 14-bit ADCs.\nFor the experiments the sender and receiver are put under\nwater (Fig. 4 right). The receiver has a sampling rate of\n10 kHz. The measured data is transmitted to a PC, where\nthe bearing and distance are calculated.\n\nFig. 7.\nbearing\n\nFig. 6. (Left) Autonomously swimming AUV recognizes obstacles with\nthe digital S&C system (active sensing); (Right) Experiments with digital\ncommunication.\n\nDuring the experiment, robot is deployed into the aquarium fulfilled with several obstacles. The available obstacles\nand aquarium's walls are used to examine the sensing capability, see Fig. 6(left). Both types of obstacles have different\n\nExperiment electric field: test circuit, video stream, calculated\n\nIn the experiment the sender was moved around the\nreceiver and the received data was recorded together with\na video tape of the experiment for comparison (Fig. 7).\nThe true bearing was extracted from the video stream and\ncompared with the from the electrical sensor data calculated\nbearing. Fig. 8 shows the result.\nFor 50% of the measuring points the error is less than 5\u25e6\nand it exceeds never more than 15\u25e6 . This might be further\nimproved by increasing the magnitude of the amplifiers and\nreducing the noise through optimized circuits and digital\nfilters.\n\n\f400\nvideo stream\nelectric sensor\n\n350\n\nangle (\u00b0)\n\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\nmeasuring point\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nFig. 8.

C ONCLUSION\nIn this work we considered several optical and electricfield-based approaches for sensing and communication\nwithin Rcl . Together with S&C approaches for Rcg , such as\nacoustic and low-frequency RF, they represent the available\nspectra of S&C technologies for underwater networked and\nswarm robotics. As indicated in the Sec. IV and from other\nperformed experiments, these approaches combine communication with localization, distance measurement and object\ndetection. In several cases, such a sub-modal information is\navailable even during communication and can be used for\nvery efficient behavioral strategies.\nEach of the considered S&C system has its own benefits\nand weaknesses. It seems that no current single system is\ncapable of achieving all the requirements on Rcl /Rcg , sensing,\nminimal build space, energy consumption and complexity.\nTherefore the best approach lies in combining several of\nthe available systems, for example in the way shown in\nFig 9. The optical system provides split wave-length depenblue/green LEDs\n\nblue/green\nphotodiodes\nhydrophone\nelectrodes\ncyan LED/\nphotodiodes\n\nFig. 9.\n\ngain control\n\nmulti-channel\noperational\namplifier\n\nDAC\nADC\n\nBUS, MCU\n\nPiezo Buzzer\n\nIrDA\n\nCombination of different S&C approaches.\n\ndent channels. It can be used in analog and digital mode\nwith existing control circuits for IR systems (e.g. IrDA or\ndifferent modulations e.g. PCM/QAM), which with small\nmodifications can be used for green, cyan and blue light. The\nrange and bandwidth are sufficient for local communication.\nThe channel is directional which can be of benefit for swarmbased coordination approaches. Additionally the reflection in\nanalog mode can be used for navigation and detection tasks.\nThe electrical sensor is a good supplementary element to\ndirectional optics. Electric fields-based channels are omnidirectional; hardware required for generation and detection\nof electric fields utilizes off-the-shelf components and is\ncompact and energy efficient. It can be used to calculate the\nbearing between sender and receiver, i.e. for self-localization.\nThe range is small but sufficient for Rcl .\n\nIt is also necessary to supplement these S&C systems by\nacoustic or ultra-low-frequency RF to provide global communication. Sonar requires a bit larger hardware equipment\nthan the optical system. With additional components, it can\nbe used for measuring distances to obstacles. RF systems\nrepresent a trade-off between the frequency (i.e. communication distances) and the size of integrated antennas (i.e. the\nsize of platform). The control circuits are more complex than\nthose for optic or acoustic approaches. Since bandwidth for\nlow-frequency RF is not sufficient for application of standard\nprotocols (e.g. ZigBee), global RF communication represents\nsome open problems. If more than one receiver is used,\nthe bearing between sender and receiver can be calculated.\nHowever this would make the hole system more complex\nand expensive. Comparing acoustic and low-frequency RF\napproaches for Rcg , acoustic one is more favorable due to\nmore less complex hardware. Usage of global communication for networked and swarm systems should be reduced to\nabsolute minimum (see for instance minimalistic approaches\nfor cooperation and decision making [22], [23]).\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe ANGELS and CoCoRo projects are funded by the\nEuropean Commission within the work programm \"Future and Emergent Technologies\" and \"Cognitive Systems\nand Robotics\" under the grant agreements no. 231845 and\n270382.
