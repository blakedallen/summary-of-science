Furthermore,the impurity band supports ferromagnetism with the induced magnetic\nmoment approaching 1\u03bcB per defect in the limit of infinite quasi-particle lifetime.\nPACS numbers: 81.05.Uw, 61.72.J-, 71.15.-m, 75.75.+a\n\nRecent experimental realization of single-layer\ngraphene[1, 2]has raised much interest in studying 2D\nDirac fermions in the context of condensed matter\nphysics. One of graphene's peculiar properties is the\nanomalous electronic properties associated with defects\nand disorders. The notable example is the observed ferromagnetic state induced by bombarding graphene with\nprotons[3]. Another example is the finite conductivity\nat the Dirac point[4], indicating the absence of strong\nlocalization in graphene. These observations appear\nto deviate from what is expected for ideal and clean\ngraphene. Since real graphene must involve disorders, it\nindicates that disorders may play an important role in\nthese phenomena.\nTheoretically, it is known that the Dirac equation\nsupports localized solutions in the presence of disorders. For instance, edge states would appear and are\nlocalized near the zig-zag edge[5]. These localized solutions thus provide support for the observed magnetism in carbon nanoribbons when the Coulomb interaction is included[6]. In general, magnetism due to defects in graphene gets widely support either by calculations based on tight-binding models or first-principle\ncalculations[7, 8, 9]. However, results obtained are varying and appear to be sensitive to sizes and boundary\nconditions of the system[11]. It is not firmly established\nthat ferromagnetism can exist in graphene[8]. On the\nother hand, theoretical work on the transport property\nof graphene also shows varying results on conductivity\nwhile experimental data consistently indicates that the\nconductivity is larger than the value 4e2 /\u03c0h obtained by\nmany calculations[12]. It is therefore important to have a\nmore reliable method for analyzing disordered graphene.\nExperimentally, there are many possible forms of defects in graphene[2, 13]. However, large defects with truly\nlocalized states interact via RKKY interaction and tend\nto induce antiferromagnetism[10]. Thus these defects do\nnot contribute the observed ferromagnetism. Theoretically, it is known that the electronic state near a point\ndefect or a disk-like defect on graphene is semi-localized\nwith amplitude decaying as 1/r when the distance r of\n\nthe electron to the defect is large[14, 15]. The semilocalization implies that disk-like defects interact directly\nand thus may be the source for ferromagnetism. Furthermore, it explains the dependence on sizes and boundary\nconditions for numerical results. In particular, it implies\nthat disk-like defects interact strongly and can not be\ntreated perturbatively. Hence it calls for an appropriate\nmethod to take the semi-localization into consideration.\nIn this Letter, we show that the semi-localization nature of defect states enables an impurity band form near\nzero energy. The existence of impurity band explains\nboth the absence of localization and possible existence\nof ferromagnetism in graphene. Specifically, we shall investigate an infinite graphene with randomly distributed\npoint defects, characterized by an on-site potential u. In\nthe large u limit[16], it is shown that the electronic spectrum due to randomly distributed point defects can be\nmapped into that of a random matrix. As a result, an\nimpurity band with density of state characterized by the\nWigner semi-circle law[17] forms. This impurity band\nappears to be observed in previous numerical results[14].\nDue to the appearance of anomalous density of states\nnear the Dirac point, we show that the conductivity\nis enhanced beyond 4e2 /\u03c0h . By further including the\nCoulomb interaction, it is shown that the impurity band\nsupports ferromagnetism with induced magnetic moment\ndepending on quasi-particle lifetime and defect density.\nWe start by considering one point defect in graphene.\nLet the Hamiltonian for electrons in the \u03c0 band of an\ninfinite graphene be H0 and the defect is located at ~r = 0.\nThe wavefunction \u03c8 for an electron then satisfies\n(H0 + u\u03b4~r,0 ) \u03c8(~r) = E\u03c8(~r).\n\n(1)\n\nThe solution \u03c8 can be found by resorting to the Huygens'\nprinciple which implies the existence of a particular solution propagating outwards from the defect to infinity.\nObviously, this solution represents a state localized near\nthe defect and is simply the Green's function, G(~r, ~r\u2032 , E),\nwhich satisfies (E \u2212H0 )G(~r, ~r\u2032 , E) = \u03b4~r,~r\u2032 . Since both H0\n\n\f2\nand E are real, it is suffice to take a particular solution\n\u03c8p (~r) = ARe [G(~r, 0, E)] ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A is a normalization constant. Clearly, because\nu\u03b4~r,0 \u03c8(~r) = u\u03b4~r,0 \u03c8(0), to satisfy Eq.(1), one requires\nA\u03b4~r,0 = u\u03b4~r,0 \u03c8p (~r) = Au\u03b4~r,0 Re [G(0, 0, E)]. Hence the\ncondition for the existence of the localized state at E0 is\n1\n= Re [G(0, 0, E0 )] .\n(3)\nu\nThe above condition can be also reached by summing\nthe Dyson series in which Gu (~r, ~r\u2032 , E) = G(~r, ~r\u2032 , E) +\nG(~r, 0, E)G(0, ~r\u2032 , E)/[1/u\u2212G(0, 0, E)] with Gu being the\nGreen's function in the presence of the defect. Clearly,\nE0 obtained in Eq.(3) specifies the pole in Gu . In the\nlimit u \u2192 \u221e, only when Re [G(0, 0, E0 )] = 0 supports\na localized state. For general u, the intersection of the\ncurve Re [G(0, 0, E)] with 1/u gives the energy E0 of the\nlocalized state. Direct numerical calculations show that\nnear E = 0, Re [G(0, 0, E)] \u2248 \u2212\u03b3E. Hence for finite and\nlarge u, E0 \u223c 1/u and in the limit u \u2192 \u221e, E0 approaches\n0. Here \u03b3 characterizes the slope of the Green's function\nnear E = 0. To the leading order of inverse quasi-particle\nlifetime, \u03b4, one finds\n\u221a Z\n1\nd2 k\n3\n,\n(4)\n\u03b3=\n2\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03b4 2 + |Ek |2\nwhere \u00b1|Ek | are the energy spectra of the \u03c0 band. It\nshows that \u03b3 goes to infinity as \u03b4 approach zero.\nNote that \u03c8p is a particular solution with the boundary condition: \u03c8 \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e. Specifically, \u03c8p (~r) goes\nas 1/r when r \u2192 \u221e[14, 15]. Since 1/r is not squareintegrable, \u03c8p is known as a semi-localized state. The\nsemi-localization implies the solution to Eq.(1) depends\non the boundary condition. In general, the localized state\nhybridizes with extended states at the same energy. The\ndegree of hybridization is determined by the boundary\ncondition. In the case when \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6k as r \u2192 \u221e with \u03c6k\nbeing the plane wave function with Ek = E0 , by appropriate superposition of \u03c6k and Im [G(~r, 0, E)], one obtains \u03c8(~r) = \u03c6k (~r) + uG(~r, 0, E0 )\u03c8(0), which reproduces\nthe usual scattering solution obtained by the LippmannSchwinger equation. In this case, after expressing \u03c8(0)\nby \u03c6k (0), it is clear that \u03c8(~r) is still dominated by the\nsemi-localized part, G(~r, 0, E0 ).\nAs indicated in the above, since G(~r, 0, E0 ) dominates\nin the weight even if it can hybridize with extended\nstates, it is therefore sufficient to consider \u03c8p . In particular, it implies that defects would couple strongly when\nmany defects are in present. The strong coupling implies that point defects can not be treated perturbatively.\nClearly, the above construction can be generalized to the\ncase with NI impurities located at ~ri with i = 1, 2, 3, * * * ,\nand NI . In this case, we have the obvious solution\n\u03c8p (~r) =\n\nNI\nX\ni=1\n\nAiE Re [G(~r, ~ri , E)] .\n\n(5)\n\nAs a generalization of Eq.(3), the energy of semi-localized\nstates satisfy\n1/u \u2212 g11\n\u2212g12\n\u2212g13\n\u2212g21\n1/u \u2212 g22\n\u2212g23\n\u2212g31\n\u2212g32\n1/u \u2212 g33\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\u2212gNI 1\n\u2212gNI 2\n\u2212gNI 3\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\u2212g1NI\n*\n\u2212g2NI\n*\n\u2212g3NI\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 1/u \u2212 gNI NI\n\n= 0,\n\n(6)\nwhere gij \u2261 [ReG(~ri , ~rj , E)] = gji . For low density of\ndefects, one expects that energies of semi-localized states\nare near 0. Since Re [G(0, 0, E)] \u2248 \u2212\u03b3E for E \u223c 0, in\nthe limit of u \u2192 \u221e, Eq.(6) reduces\n0\n0\n\u03b3E\n\u2212g12\n\u2212g13\n0\n0\n\u2212g21\n\u03b3E\n\u2212g23\n0\n0\n\u2212g31\n\u2212g32\n\u03b3E\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212gN\n\u2212g\n\u2212g\n1\nN\n2\nNI 3\nI\nI\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n0\n* \u2212g1N\nI\n0\n* \u2212g2NI\n0\n* \u2212g3N\nI\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* \u03b3E\n\n= 0,\n\n(7)\n\n0\nwhere gij\n\u2261 Re [G(~ri , ~rj , 0)]. For randomly distributed\npositions of defects, Eq.(7) implies that except for the\nscaling factor \u03b3, energies of the electronic states are exactly the eigenvalues of a symmetric random matrix. In\nthe limit NI \u2192 \u221e, it is known that the density of \u03b3E\nfollows the Wigner semi-circle law[18]. Converting the\nWigner semi-circle law to the density of electronic states,\nD(E), we find\nnI \u03b3 p 2\n4\u2206 \u2212 \u03b3 2 E 2 ,\n(8)\nD(E) =\n2\u03c0\u22062\n\n0 2\nwhere nI is the density of defects and \u22062 = NI h(gij\n) i\nwith h* * *i denoting the average over positions of defects.\nThus the electronic states due to defects form an impurity band with width w being determined by \u2206 via the\nrelation w = 4\u2206/\u03b3. We note in passing that Eq.(6) can\nbe also obtained by summing the Dyson series for gij .\nHowever, the existence of the impurity band is a nonperturbative result which can not be obtained by summing each averaged term (averaged over the impurity\npotential) in the Dyson series.\nFor randomly distributed defects on graphene with N\nlattice points, the probability for aP\ndefect being located\n0 2\n0 2\n) /N 2 , which\nat ~ri is 1/N . Hence < (gij\n) >= ij (gij\n0 2\nshows that < (gij\n) > is nothing but the Fourier trans0 2\nformation of (gij\n) at ~k = 0. We find \u22062 = \u03b3nI /2 and\np\nhence w = 8nI /\u03b3, which vanishes when \u03b4 goes to zero.\n0\nNote that because gij\ndoes not vanish only when i and j\nbelong to different sublattices, the impurity band results\nfrom the bipartite nature of graphene.\nWe first address the issue on possibility of magnetism\ninduced by the impurity band. We note that the impurity\nband is a flat-band with hopping connecting every pair\nof defects. According to the mechanism for flat-band\n\n\f3\nTo extend the above analysis to finite density of defects, we first note that the normalization\nof the waveP\nfunction in Eq.(5) implies that h ~r \u03c8p2 (~r)i = 1. If we\nset E \u223c 0, we find hAiE AjE i = \u03b4ij /NI \u03b3. By expanding\nP\n\u2020\n\u2020\nCi\u03c3\n= E,j AjE g(~ri , ~rj , E)CE\u03c3\nand approximating E to\n\u2020\n0 in g(~ri , ~rj , E), it is clear that hCi\u03c3\nCi\u03c3 i is determined by\n\u2020\nhCE\u03c3\nCE\u03c3 i. We find that the competition between ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and nonmagnetic states is\ndetermined by the exchange energy\nhHC iexchange\nFIG. 1: Locations of defects that favor the spin-triplet state\nwhen two electrons filled in semi-localized state of two defects.\nHere one defect is fixed at the center, marked by X, while\nthe other defect is denoted by a solid dot only when the spintriplet is favored. Here sizes of the dots represent the strength\nof the triplet state.\n\nferromagnetism[19], the impurity band supports ferromagnetism for the case when the system can be modeled\nby the Hubbard model. However, since screening is considered to be less severe in two dimension, it calls for\nusing more realistic Coulomb potentials. To investigate\nthe magnetic property due to realistic Coulomb potential, we calculate the exchange energy for the impurity\nband due to unscreened long-range Coulomb interaction\nHC =\n\ne2 X \u2020\n1\nCi\u03c3 Ci\u03c3\nC \u2020 \u2032 Cj\u03c3\u2032 .\n8\u03c0\u01eb0\n|~\nr\n\u2212\n~rj | j\u03c3\ni\n\u2032\n\n(9)\n\ni,j,\u03c3,\u03c3\n\nWe start by considering an undoped graphene with two\ndefects, in which semi-localized states are filled with two\nelectrons. In this case, solutions to Eq.(7) split into E+\nand E\u2212 . with the splitting, E+ \u2212 E\u2212 = 2|g 0 (~ri \u2212 ~rj )|.\nHence the splitting oscillates in the same way as g 0 does\nand vanishes when i and j belong to the same sublattice. Obviously, two electrons can be filled in E\u00b1 separately or filled in the same states with the spin state\nbeing singlet. If the Hund's rule dominates, two electrons fill in E\u00b1 separately with their spins being in the\ntriplet state. Based on solutions to Eq.(6) and the corresponding wavefunctions, both Coulomb and exchange\nintegrals are calculated so that the preferred spin state\ncan be found. Fig. 1 shows our numerical calculations on\nlocations of defects that favor the spin-triplet state for\nu = \u221e. Here one defect is fixed at the center, marked\nby X, while the other defect is shown by a solid dot only\nwhen the spin-triplet is favored. It is seen that for large\ndistances when the splitting is small, spin triplet state\nis always favored; while the spin singlet state is favored\nonly for some of lattice points at short distances when\nthe splitting is large and exchange energy gain does not\nwin over the splitting.\n\ne2 (n2\u2191 + n2\u2193 ) X\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\u01eb0 \u03b3 2\n|~\nr\n\u2212\n~rj |\ni\ni,j\n\nNI\nX\n\nk=1\n\n0 0\ngik\ngjk\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(10)\nwhere n\u03c3 = N\u03c3 /NI are fractions of electrons in the state\nwith the z component of spin being \u03c3. In the ferromagnetic state, n\u2191 6= n\u2193 . Therefore, the Fermi energies for\ndifferent spin states are also different. Let E\u03c3 be the\ncorresponding Fermi energy in the spin state \u03c3. The total energy in the impurity band for each spin state is\nR E\u03c3\ndEED(E). For an undoped graphene, E\u2193 = \u2212E\u2191 .\n\u2212w/2\np\nWe find that n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 = 2(y 1 \u2212 y 2 + sin\u22121 y)/\u03c0 with\ny = \u03b3E\u2191 /2\u2206, while the change of the total energy in the\nimpurity band per side is\n\u2206k =\n\ni\n2nI w h\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 y 2 )3/2 .\n3\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nUsing Eq.(10), the dependence of the exchange energy\nper site on n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 can be extracted and we find\n\u0010 p\n\u00112\n\u221a\ne2\n(2+ 3)n2I y 1 \u2212 y 2 + sin\u22121 y ,\n3\n4\u03c0 \u01eb0 a\n(12)\nwhere a = 2.46\u00c5 for graphene. In deriving Eq.(12), we\n0\nhave expressed gij\nand 1/|~ri \u2212~rj | in the momentum space\nand approximated functions that are smooth in q by the\ncorresponding values at Dirac points. It is clear that minimizing \u2206k+\u2206Eexchange with respect to y determines the\ninduced magnetic moment. Note that the value y0 where\nthe p\nminimum occurs is determined by the intersection\nof y 1 \u2212 y 2 + sin\u22121 y and sy with s = 0.072w(eV )/nI .\nFig. 2(a) shows a typical dependence of magnetic moment\nper defect (m\u03bcB ) on the width (w) of the impurity band\nfor fixed defect density. It is clear that increasing the\nbandwidth would reduce the induced magnetic moment,\nwhich is consistent with the trend shown in Fig. 1. In the\nlimit of infinite quasi-particle\nlifetime, because \u03b3 goes to\np\ninfinity and w = 8nI /\u03b3, s approaches zero. Hence y0\napproaches one so that the induced magnetic moment\napproaches 1\u03bcB per defect, in consistent with the first\nprinciple calculation[8]. On the contrary, when temperature increases, \u03b4 increases and \u03b3 decreases, hence the\ninduced magnetic moment decreases. For fixed quasiparticle lifetime, because \u2206k and \u2206Eexchange have dif3/2\nferent nI dependence: \u2206k \u223c nI and \u2206Eexchange \u223c n2I ,\n\u2206Eexchange = \u2212\n\n\f4\nmagnetic moment approaches 1\u03bcB per defect in the limit\nof infinite quasi-particle lifetime and a threshold in defect\ndensity is required to stabilize ferromagnetism at fixed\ntemperatures. Finally, the impurity band enhances the\nconductivity at the Dirac point to the order of 4e2 /h, in\nconsistent with experimental observations.\n\n1\n\nm\n\n(a)\n0.5\n\n0\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\nWe thank Profs.

Here \u03b4 = 0.001t. Clearly, for\nfixed quasi-particle lifetime, a threshold in defect density is\nnecessary to stabilize the ferromagnetic state.\n\ntheir competition leads to a threshold in the defect density to induce ferromagnetism, as shown in Fig. 2(b).\nWe now address the issue of the transport property by\nexplicitly calculating the conductivity using the Kubo\nformula[20]. Here the total current is give by J~ =\nP\n\u2020\nCj\u03c3 with t being the hopping ampliiet/h\u0304 j,\u03b4 ~\u03b4Cj+\u03b4\u03c3\ntude and ~\u03b4 connecting nearest neighbors. In zero temperature, we find the dc conductivity is given by\nx\n\u2032\n\u03c3 = 2\u03c0h\u0304N hJEE\n\u2032 iD(E)D(E )|\nE=0,E \u2032 =0 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we have expressed Ci\u03c3 in terms of CE\u03c3 .

For\n2 2\nsmall \u03b4, because I \u223c 1/(2\u03c0t \u03b4 ), we find \u03c3 is larger\nthan the value 4e2 /h by the factor w2 /4\u03c0\u03b4 2 . Since typical mean free path for graphene is about 30 nanometers,\nnI \u223c 10\u22125 \u221210\u22126. Therefore, for \u03b4/t \u223c 10\u22123 , we find that\nthe enhance factor is from the order O(1), in agreement\nwith experimental observations[12].\nTo summarize, we show that point defects on graphene\nare strongly correlated so that an impurity band near\nzero energy forms with the density of state characterized\nby the Wigner semi-circle law. It is shown that the impurity band supports ferromagnetism with induced magnetic moment depending on quasi-particle lifetime and\ndefect density. Furthermore, we find that the induced\n\n[1] K. S.
