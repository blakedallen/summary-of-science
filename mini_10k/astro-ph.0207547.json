We investigate the role of rotational effects in inducing asymmetry\npresent above \u223c 5 GeV in the double-peak lightcurves of the bright EGRET pulsars: Vela, Crab, and Geminga. According to Thompson (2001), the trailing peak\ndominates over the leading peak above \u223c 5 GeV consistently for all three pulsars, even though this is not the case over the entire energy range of EGRET, i.e.\nabove \u223c 100 MeV. We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations of electromagnetic cascades in a pulsar magnetosphere within a single-polar-cap scenario\nwith rotationally-induced propagation effects of the order of \u03b2 (where \u03b2 is the\ndimensionless local corotation velocity). We find that even in the case of nearly\naligned rotators with spin periods of P \u223c 0.1 s rotation may lead to asymmetric (with respect to the magnetic axis) magnetic photon absorption which in turn\nleads to asymmetric gamma-ray pulse profiles.

Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n44, B1951+32, and B1055-52) extend up to <\n\u223c 10 GeV. All three pulsars feature gamma\n\nlightcurves characterised by two strong peaks separated by 0.4 to 0.5 in rotational phase.\n\nThese double-peak pulses are asymmetrical and their profiles change with energy. Above\n\u223c 100 MeV the leading peak (LP) is stronger than the trailing peak (TP) in the case of\nthe Vela and the Crab pulsars, and the opposite is true for Geminga. However, for all\nthree pulsars their leading peaks exhibit lower energy cutoffs - around \u223c 5 GeV - than the\ntrailing peaks (TP). In other words, the trailing peaks dominate over the leading peaks\nabove \u223c 5 GeV (Thompson 2001). In the case of the Vela pulsar and Geminga, this effect\nis accompanied by the softening of the spectrum of the leading peak (Fierro et al. 1998,\nKanbach 1999). Potential importance of the double-peak pulse asymmetry in the case of\nVela was already acknowledged \u2013 at the time when the COS-B data became available \u2013\nby Morini 1983 who attempted to explain the asymmetry with a hybrid model, with two\ndifferent mechanisms responsible for the formation of the leading and the trailing peak.\nHigh-energy cutoffs in pulsar spectra are interpreted within polar cap models as due\nto one-photon absorption of gamma-rays in strong magnetic field with subsequent e\u00b1 pair creation. A piece of observational support for such an interpretation comes from\na strong correlation between the inferred 'spin-down' magnetic field strength and the\nposition of the high-energy cutoff (Baring & Harding 2000, Baring 2001). This in turn\nopens a possibility that the observed asymmetry between LP and TP, i.e. the dominance\nof LP over TP above \u223c 5 GeV, is a direct consequence of propagation effects (which\neventually lead to stronger magnetic photon absorption for photons forming LP than\nTP) rather than due to some inherent property of the gamma-ray emission region itself.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the role of pulsar rotation in a built-up of\nsuch asymmetry in the double-peak pulse profiles. We consider purely rotational effects:\ndue to presence of rotation-induced electric field E, aberration of photon direction and\nslippage of magnetosphere under the photon's path. In section 2 we compare them with\nsome other effects which may be responsible for the asymmetry (like various distortions\nof the magnetic field structure). In section 3 we show that the rotation effects result in\nan asymmetric pair production rate for the leading and the trailing part of the magnetosphere even in the case when the magnetic field structure and the population of radiating\nparticles are symmetric around the magnetic pole. In section 4 asymmetric pulse profiles are calculated as a function of photon energy and then the model predictions of\nthe ratio of fluxes in the leading and trailing peaks are compared with the inferred ratio\nfor Vela at different energy bins. In section 5 we address the significance of rotationdriven asymmetry across the pulsar parameter space. Our main results are discussed in\nSection 6.\n\n\fJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n3\n\n2. Symmetric features of the model\nIt has been argued in many studies of radio properties of pulsars (eg. Blaskiewicz et\nal. 1991, Gangadhara & Gupta 2001) that a rigidly rotating static-like dipole can be\nused as a good approximation of dipolar magnetic field as long as only most important\nrotation effects, of the order of \u03b2 = v/c (where v is the local corotation velocity and c is\nthe speed of light), are to be considered. According to order-of-magnitude estimates, small\ndistortions of the dipolar magnetosphere induced by rotationally-driven currents can be\nneglected: longitudinal currents suspected to flow within the open field line region cannot\nmodify B by a factor exceeding \u03b2 3/2 whereas toroidal currents due to plasma corotation\nchange B barely by a value of the order of \u03b2 2 . A more comprehensive discussion of the\ninfluence of currents on the magnetospheric structure can be found in Beskin (1999) and\nreferences therein.\nBelow we follow the approximation of a rigidly rotating static-like dipole: at any\ninstant the magnetic field has the shape of a static dipole in the frame which corotates\nwith a neutron star. Moreover, the magnetosphere is assumed to be filled out everywhere\nwith the Goldreich-Julian charge density, so that a rotation-induced electric field E =\n\u2212\u03b2 \u00d7 B is present in the OF, whereas E \u2032 = 0 in the frame corotating with the star. We\nneglect deviations from this corotational electric field which are present in the chargedeficient polar gap region \u2013 they do not exceed a factor of \u03b2 3/2 .\nIn our Monte Carlo simulations (section 4) development of gamma-ray radiation is\nbased on the model of Daugherty & Harding 1982, with primary electrons being injected\nalong magnetic field lines at an altitude of a few neutron star radii, at the magnetic\ncolatitude corresponding to the last open magnetic field lines, and uniformly in the\nmagnetic azimuth. The electrons are assumed to accelerate instantly to the energy E0 \u223c\n\n107 MeV and subsequently to cool down emitting curvature photons. Some of the photons\n\ninduce in turn electromagnetic cascades which propagate outwards in a form of a hollow\ncone beam (see Dyks & Rudak 2000 for detailed description of directionality aspects of\nthe casades as well as viewing geometry).\n\n3. Rotation-driven asymmetry\nIn this section we present in detail the mechanisms which lead to rotation-induced asymmetry in the (otherwise axially symmetric) hollow-cone gamma-ray beam. For the sake\nof better demonstration of the effects we consider an exaggerated case: propagation of\na photon in the equatorial plane of a fast orthogonal rotator. Fig. 1 shows the case for\nthe rotation period P = 1.5 ms: photons of the same energy in the corotating frame\n(CF) are emitted from two opposite points on the outer rim of the polar cap tangentially to the magnetic field lines in the CF. To follow their straight-line propagation in\nthe inertial observer frame (OF) three effects have to be taken into account: 1) In the\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Dyks & B.

Top view of orthogonally rotating pulsar with the spin period P = 1.5 ms; the\nsense of rotation is counter-clockwise (indicated); the cartesian coordinates are in units of\nthe light cylinder Rlc = cP/2\u03c0. The magnetic field lines are approximated with the staticlike dipole of the magnetic moment \u03bc (indicated). Two photon trajectories (starting from\ntwo opposite points on the polar cap) in the inertial observer frame (OF) are marked\nwith two long dotted lines. These are the prototypes of the leading peak (on the left) and\nthe trailing peak (on the right). In the corotating frame (CF) these trajectories follow\nthe long dashed lines. Short segments of the dotted-line trajectories (OF) have been\ntransformed via rotation to several actual photon locations in the magnetosphere, and\nthus they indicate the local propagation directions \u03b7\u0302 of the photons in OF. Solid arrows\nat these locations point along the directions \u03b7\u0302 F P of local free propagation in OF. Note\nmuch larger angles between \u03b7\u0302 F P and \u03b7\u0302 for the photons of the leading peak than for the\nphotons of the trailing peak.\n\nOF the photons propagate at an aberrated direction (dotted lines in Fig. 1) and differ\nin energy. 2) The rotation-induced electric field E = \u2212\u03b2 \u00d7 B, which is present in the\nOF, modifies the rate of the magnetic photon absorption in a different way for photons\nforming the LP than for photons forming the TP. 3) The electromagnetic field in the OF\nis time-dependent: because of the rotation the photons propagate through different parts\nof the magnetosphere.\nWe find that the second effect - due to rotationally induced E - plays a dominant role\nin generating the asymmetry in the magnetic absorption rate R between photons of the\nLP and the TP. An importance of a weak electric field E \u22a5 B for the rate R was for the\n\n\fJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n5\n\nfirst time recognized by Daugherty & Lerche (1975) who presented also its quantitative\ntreatment. A consequence of its presence is that the rate R does not vanish along the\ndirection of local B any more, and becomes non-axisymmetric with respect to it as well.\nInstead, the rate R vanishes along two new directions which lie in the plane perpendicular\nto E and deviate from B by angle \u223c E/B in such a way that in a local coordinate frame\nwith \u1e91 k B, \u0177 k E, and x\u0302 k E \u00d7 B the \"free propagation\" direction \u03b7\u0302 F P = [\u03b7xF P , \u03b7yF P , \u03b7zF P ]\n\nhas two solutions: [E/B, 0, \u00b1(1 \u2212 E 2/B 2 )1/2 ]. For definiteness, hereafter we will consider\nphotons which propagate outwards within the regions above the northern magnetic pole\n(i.e. with propagation vectors \u03b7\u0302 satisfying \u03b7\u0302 * B > 0) which corresponds to the case of\n\n\u03b7zF P = +(1 \u2212 E 2 /B 2 )1/2 . Fig. 2 shows the mean free path \u03bbmfp = c/R for the magnetic\n\nphoton absorption for different directions in the plane perpendicular to E. The rate R was\ncalculated by performing Lorentz transformation to a frame in which E \u2032 = 0 and then\napplying a purely magnetic formula.

Six lines in Fig. 2\ncorrespond to six values of the ratio E/B: 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, and 0.999. Note that the\nfree propagation direction deviates from the local B by angle \u03b8F P which increases with\nincreasing contribution of the electric field: \u03b8zF P \u2261 arccos(\u03b7zF P ) = arcsin(E/B) \u2243 E/B.\nMoreover, R increases (\u03bbmfp decreases) monotonically with increasing angle 6 (\u03b7\u0302, \u03b7\u0302 F P ). As\nlong as E \u226a B, magnetic photon absorption rate R remains approximately symmetric\naround the free propagation direction \u03b7\u0302 F P .\nThe directions of \u03b7\u0302 F P at various points within the magnetosphere are shown in Fig. 1\nin the OF (with solid arrows). At the points of photon emission the direction \u03b7\u0302 F P overlaps\nwith the photon direction \u03b7\u0302 since this is where the angle \u03b8B between the photon direction\nand the magnetic field line equals \u03b8B \u2243 E/B and consequently R = 0 (Harding et al.\n1978, Zheng et al. 1998). Initially, therefore, the rate R is the same for photons emitted\nfrom two opposite sites of the polar cap rim which in this picture give rise to the leading\npeak and the trailing peak. But as the photons propagate outward their \u03b7\u0302 begin to\ndeviate from local free propagation directions \u03b7\u0302 F P opening thus a possibility for magnetic\nphoton absorption and electron-positron pair creation. Three effects are responsible for\nit to happen: (1) curvature of the magnetic field lines, (2) increase of E/B with altitude,\nand (3) slippage of magnetic field lines under the photon's path. For a static-like dipole\n(assumed in section 2) the curvature of lines is symmetric with respect to the magnetic\naxis. Consequently, symmetry is expected between the rates of magnetic absorption for\n\n\f6\n\nJ. Dyks & B.

Directional dependence of the mean free path \u03bbmfp for magnetic absorption of a\nphoton emitted at the center of the reference frame (with the coordinates [0, 0]) is shown\nfor six values of E/B (denoted with six different line types). The electric field vector\nE is pointing at the right angle to the page, and toward the reader; the E \u00d7 B vector\nis parallel to the horizontal axis, and pointing to the left. The mean free path \u03bbmfp is\nsymmetric with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\nLP photons and TP photons. Any asymmetry between the LP and the TP may occur via\nthe effects (2) and (3) only. Whenever the curvature of magnetic field lines happens to be\nrelatively large (which is the case at the polar cap rims of pulsars with P \u223c 0.1 s) the effect\n(1) significantly dominates over (2) and (3), which means that the resulting asymmetry\nis quite subtle. However, for a relatively small curvature of magnetic field lines (and\nappreciable local corotation velocities \u03b2) the resulting asymmetry becomes pronounced\n[note that these 'favourable' conditions are fulfilled within outer-gap accelerators].\nWe find that the effect (2) \u2013 the presence of electric field \u2013 is crucial for generating\nthe asymmetry. The way in which this effect operates can be most clearly assessed by\ninspecting Fig. 2. Let us consider a photon propagation vector \u03b7\u0302 anchored at the origin of\nframe in the figure. For photons emitted close to the star, both in the LP and the TP, \u03b7\u0302\ninitially points along the \u03b7\u0302 F P direction which differs only slightly from the direction of B\nin Fig. 2 since E \u226a B. As the LP photon moves away from emission point, its propagation\nvector rotates clockwise in Fig. 2 which reflects the fact that B diverges from \u03b7\u0302 due to\nthe magnetic field line curvature. At the same time, however, the directional pattern of\n\u03bbmfp rotates counterclockwise due to increase in E/B which additionally enhances the\nabsorption rate. In the case of the TP photon, however, both its propagation vector \u03b7\u0302\n\n\fJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n7\n\nand the directional pattern of \u03bbmfp rotate in the same direction (counterclockwise) with\nrespect to B in Fig. 2 so that the absorption rate is weakened. Thus, for photons within\nthe LP the effects (1) and (2) cummulate, whereas for the TP they effectively tend to\ncancel out each other, and the expected asymmetry between the peaks is due to stronger\nabsorption suffered by photons within the LP than by photons of the same energy within\nthe TP. Accordingly, the high energy cutoff in the LP spectrum will occur at a slightly\nlower energy than the cutoff in the TP spectrum. The slippage (3) affects this picture\nin the way which depends on both the rotation period and the photon position within\nthe magnetosphere, but an overall picture remains unchanged. For most rotation periods\n(P > a few ms), the slippage reduces the asymmetry only marginally. For the fastest\nrotators (P \u223c 1.5 ms) it enhances the asymmetry by making photons of the TP to\npropagate along the free propagation direction (or, equivalently, along the magnetic field\nlines in the CF). The latter case is presented in Fig. 1 where the photon propagation\ndirection \u03b7\u0302 as seen in the OF (dotted lines) and the local free propagation direction \u03b7\u0302 F P\nin the OF (solid arrows) are shown for several positions along the photon trajectory in\nthe CF. Strong absorption within the LP is anticipated, whereas within the TP \u03b7\u0302 nearly\ncoincides with \u03b7\u0302 F P .\nAnother way to understand this asymmetry is to follow photon trajectories in a\nreference frame (with primed quantities) where the condition\nE\u2032 = 0\n\n(2)\n\nis fulfilled. In such a frame, an asymmetry in R\u2032 (cf. eq.(1)) for the LP and TP photons\n\u2032\narises from transformation properties of \u03b8B\n(aberration), \u03b5\u2032 (red- or blue-shift), and B \u2032 .\n\nOne of the reference frames satisfying the condition (2) is a reference frame of local E \u00d7B\ndrift. Denoting dimensionless drift velocity \u03b2 D = E \u00d7 B/B 2 , the transformations read:\n\nB\n,\n\u03b3D\n2 1/2\n[(\u03b7x \u2212 \u03b2D )2 + \u03b7y2 (1 \u2212 \u03b2D\n)]\n\u2032\nsin \u03b8B\n=\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7x \u03b2D )\n\u03b5\u2032 = \u03b5 \u03b3D (1 \u2212 \u03b7x \u03b2D ),\n\nB\u2032 =\n\n(3)\n\nIn the equatorial plane of orthogonal rotator \u03b7y = 0 so that \u03b7x = \u2213 sin \u03b8B , where the\nsigns 'minus' and 'plus' correspond to the leading and the trailing peak, respectively. The\n\u2032\ntransformation of propagation angle reduces then to sin \u03b8B\n= |\u03b7x \u2212 \u03b2D |/(1 \u2212 \u03b7x \u03b2D ). The\n\n\u2032\nTaylor expansion of sin \u03b8B\n, \u03b5\u2032 , and B \u2032 around \u03b2D = 0 reveals that a difference between the\n\nmagnetic absorption rates in the locally drifting frame and in the OF results primarily\nfrom the aberration of photon direction, whereas the changes in \u03b5 and B are second\norder effects. Obviously, the aberration is asymmetric for the LP and the TP (\u03b7x < 0\nand \u03b7x > 0, respectively). Fig. 1 presents this 'aberration effect' in the rigidly corotating\nframe, where E \u2032 = 0 is assumed. Photon trajectories in this frame (dashed curves)\n\u2032\nindicate clearly that photons of the leading peak encounter larger B\u22a5\nthan photons of\n\nthe trailing peak of the same energy.\n\n\f8\n\nJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n4. Numerical modelling of the gamma-ray data\n\nWe performed Monte Carlo simulations of curvature-radiation-induced electromagnetic\ncascades developing above a polar cap. The cascade development due to magnetic photon\nabsorption accompanied by e\u00b1 -pair creation and then synchrotron emission was followed\nin a 3D space in order to analyse pulse properties. As an example we choose a model\nwith basic parameters of the Vela pulsar: Bpc = 6.8 TG, P = 0.0893 s. In order to meet\nobservational restrictions for the Vela, both spectral and temporal, the following general\nrequirements within polar-cap scenarios had to be satisfied: 1) a polar-cap accelerator\nshould be placed a few stellar radii above pulsar's surface (Dyks et al. 2001); 2) an\ninclination angle \u03b1 of the magnetic dipole with respect to the spin axis must not be\nlarge, and the pulsar has to be a nearly-aligned rotator (Daugherty & Harding 1994).\nRecently Harding & Muslimov (1998) proposed a physical mechanism for lifting the polar\ncap accelerator up to 0.5 \u2212 1 RNS above the surface. However, this altitude is still too\nlow to explain the 10 GeV radiation emerging the Vela magnetosphere unattenuated.\nTherefore, we placed the polar-cap accelerator at the altitude of h0 = 4 RNS to ensure\nthat the magnetosphere is not entirely opaque to curvature photons of energy <\n\u223c 10\nGeV (see Dyks et al. 2001 for the detailed model spectral fitting for the Vela pulsar).\n\nSimilarly, Miyazaki & Takahara (1997) achieved the best agreement between the observed\nand their modelled pulse profiles of the Crab pulsar placing the accelerator at h0 = 4 Rns .\nTo reproduce the observed peak-to-peak separation \u2206peak \u2243 0.42 (Kanbach et al. 1994)\nwe assumed (after Dyks & Rudak 2000) for the inclination angle \u03b1 and the observer's\nangle \u03b6obs (an angle between the line-of-sight and the spin axis) that \u03b1 = \u03b6obs = 7.6\u25e6 .\nOur numerical results are presented in Fig. 3 (a + b). The three columns of Fig. 3 show\n(from left to right): 1) mapping onto the parameter space \u03b6obs vs. \u03c6 of outgoing photons\nwith energy \u03b5 > \u03b5limit (where \u03c6 denotes a phase of rotation), 2) double-peak pulse profile\ndue to these photons when \u03b6obs = 7.6\u25e6 , and 3) phase-integrated energy spectrum of these\nphotons, with the position of \u03b5limit indicated with dotted vertical line. The eight rows\ncorrespond to 8 different values of \u03b5limit: 1, 10, 102 , 103 , 4*103 , 6*103 , 8*103 , and 104 MeV\n(top to bottom). An asymmetry in the double-peak profiles is noticable even though the\nrotator is nearly aligned: at the highest energies, above \u223c 6 GeV, the leading peak LP\nis less intense than the trailing peak TP (three lowermost panels in the middle column\nin Fig. 3 b). This is a direct result of stronger magnetic absorption of the LP photons\ncomparing to the TP photons. The distribution of these photons in the corresponding\npanels of \u03b6obs vs. \u03c6 (the left column) shows that at viewing angles \u03b6obs larger than 7.6\u25e6\n(not allowed due to the fixed peak-to-peak separation of 0.42) the asymmetry in pulse\nprofile would be even stronger. This demonstrates an increasing role of rotational effects\nas the distance from the spin axis increases.\n\n\fJ. Dyks & B.

Continuation of Fig. 3 a.\n\ne\u00b1 pair production rate. Consequently, higher number of low-energy synchrotron photons\nemerges at the LP than at the TP. This is the reason for a dominance of the LP over\nthe TP below \u223c 100 MeV, noticable in Fig. 3 a. Combining the results from both energy\ndomains, a characteristic inversion in the relative strentgh of the LP and the TP occurs\nacross the gamma-ray energy space. A qualitatively similar inversion of peak intensities\ntakes place in the gamma-ray double-pulse of the Vela pulsar (Thompson 2001).\nThe beam of synchrotron radiation in our cascades occupies a very narrow range of\nmagnetic colatitudes; in other words - it is highly anisotropic. The reasons for this include a very limited range of altitudes at which the e\u00b1 pairs are created and the effects\nof relativistic beaming. By comparison, curvature radiation below \u223c 100 MeV is much\nless anisotropic. Therefore, the prominent peaks visible at \u03b5 < 100 MeV (two uppermost\npanels of Fig. 3 a) consist almost entirely of synchrotron radiation (SR) photons, whereas\nthe apparently flat wings outside the peaks (i.e. within the \"offpulse\" region corresponding to high altitudes) are composed of curvature radiation (CR) photons. A close-up view\nof the double-peak pulse profile for \u03b5 > 1 MeV shown in Fig. 4 reveals that the CR wings\n\n\fJ. Dyks & B.

Note the relatively weaker wings outside the peaks and much softer\n\nspectrum in comparison with the previous case of E0 = 107 MeV (Fig. 3 a, third row\nfrom the top). The data for the Vela pulsar are laid over the model spectrum: boxes\nare the data from the first COMPTEL source catalogue (see Table 3 in Sch\u00f6nfelder et\nal. 2000), and dots (plus an upper limit above 10 GeV) are the EGRET data (Thompson\net al. 1997). The flux level \u03b5F\u03b5 is in MeV cm\u22122 s\u22121 units.\n\nrelative to the intensity of peaks depends sensitively on the richness of the cascades, i.e.\non the multiplicity M (the number of created pairs per primary electron). The results\ndiscussed above and presented in Fig. 3 had been obtained for the initial energy of primary\nelectrons E0 = 107 MeV which yielded M = 73. By increasing the initial energy E0 up\n\nto 2 * 107 MeV the multiplicity reaches M = 830 and the corresponding pulse profile\nat 100 MeV (left panel of Fig. 5) changes notably with respect to its counterpart of\nFig. 3 a. It reveals now a much lower level of wings outside the peaks. Equally important\nis the change in the shape of the phase-averaged energy spectrum which becomes much\nsofter by gaining more power in the low-energy range (right panel in Fig. 5). Both new\nfeatures are in rough agreement with the data for the Vela pulsar, contrary to the case\nwith E0 = 107 MeV. It is interesting to note that the association of the broad peaks at\n100 MeV with the relatively hard spectrum (Fig. 3 a) on one hand, and of the narrow\npeaks with the soft spectrum (Fig. 5) on the other hand do resemble qualitatively the\nobserved characteristics of Geminga and the Vela pulsar, respectively.\nWe may now test our model of the double-peak asymmetry by confronting the numerical results obtained for specific pulsar parameters with the data for real objects. Since\nthe effect is induced by magnetic absorption the expected weakening of the leading peak\nwith respect to the trailing peak occurs only in the vicinity of the high-energy spectral\n\n\fJ.

Therefore, it is essential to have a good photon statistics also at the highest energy bins, i.e. above 1 GeV.

We used the EGRET data for Vela to calculate\nthe ratio (denoted as P 2/P 1) of the photon counts in the LP and the TP (denoted as\nP 1 and P 2, respectively). For each energy bin (the energy bins cover the range between\n\u223c 30 MeV and \u223c 10 GeV) we calculated P 1 (P 2) by summing up all photons within\nthe range \u03c6lp \u00b1 0.05 (\u03c6tp \u00b1 0.05) in phase, where \u03c6lp (\u03c6tp ) is the phase of maximum\nin the LP (the TP) at 100 MeV. Fig. 6 shows the observational points as well as their\nestimated errors1 along with the results of model calculations performed for three different altitudes: h0 = 2RNS , 3RNS , and 4RNS . The overall qualitative and quantitative\nbehaviour of P 2/P 1 for the EGRET data is very similar to the dependence presented by\nKanbach et al. 1980 for the COS-B data. The data points certainly can acommodate our\nmodel. However, to answer the question of whether it would be inevitable to invoke any\nadditional processes to reproduce the increase in P 2/P 1 inferred from the data requires\nbetter photon statistics at the spectral cut-off and careful statistical analysis.\n\n1\n\nDetailed analysis of the data will be presented elsewhere (Wo\u017ana et al. 2002, in preparation).\n\n\f14\n\nJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n5. Rotational asymmetry as a function of pulsar parameters\nThe asymmetry effects are marginal for nearly aligned pulsars with periods P \u223c 0.1 s. For\nthe above-described model of Vela, they are noticeable only because of the high altitude\n\u25e6\nof the accelerator (h0 = 4RNS ). However, for highly inclined (\u03b1 >\n\u223c 45 ) and fast pulsars\n(P <\n\u223c 10 ms) the rotational effects result in asymmetry of considerable magnitude. If\n\ndetected by GLAST, GeV emission from such objects would provide powerful diagnostics\nof the polar cap model. Below we present the magnitude of such asymmetry predicted\nfor a wide range of parameters for fast pulsars.\nAs a measure of rotational effects we consider the escape energy \u03b5esc which is defined\nas a maximum energy of a photon (and the photon is emitted tangentially to its 'parent'\nmagnetic field line; a footpoint of this line has magnetic colatitude \u03b8) for which the\nmagnetosphere is still transparent, i.e. for which the optical depth integrated along the\nphoton trajectory is less than 1. This energy was calculated with our numerical code and\nthe results are shown below. For the sake of comparison with the case of no rotational\neffects we recall a simplified, yet quite accurate2 for magnetic fields weaker than \u223c 0.1Bcr ,\nanalytic formula which (after e.g. Bulik et al. 2000) reads\n\u03b5esc (\u03b8) =\n\n\u03b8pc\n* \u03b5esc (\u03b8pc ),\n\u03b8\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u03b5esc (\u03b8pc ) \u2248 1 GeV\n\n\u0012\n\nBpc\n0.1 Bcr\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\u03b8pc\n0.01 rad\n\u0012\n\u00135/2\nrm\n\u00d7\n.\nRNS\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\n(6)\n\nHere rm is the radial coordinate of the emission point (with spherical coordinates (rm ,\n\u03b8m , \u03c6m ) in the right-handed frame with \u1e91-axis along the dipole axis) and \u03b8 \u226a 1 rad is\nthe magnetic colatitude of a footpoint of the parent magnetic field line at the neutron\nstar surface. For field lines originating at the polar-cap rim one should take then \u03b8 = \u03b8pc ,\np\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b8pc = arcsin( (RNS /Rlc )) \u2248 1.45 * 10\u22122/ P radians, and Rlc = cP/2\u03c0 is the light\n\ncylinder. Note, that the escape energy of eq.(5) is symmetrical with respect to the dipole\n\naxis and goes to infinity at the magnetic pole (\u03b8 = 0). Such a behaviour is not the case,\nhowever, when the rotational effects discussed in section 3 are taken into account.\nIn Figs. 7, 8, and 9 we present the values of \u03b5esc obtained numerically for fast rotators\nwith Bpc = 1 TG, and emission points located on the polar cap surface, i.e. rem = RNS\nwas assumed everywhere. Let us begin with the case of orthogonal rotators (i.e. \u03b1 = 90\u25e6 )\n- these are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Here we consider emission points lying along the\ncrossection of polar cap surface with the equatorial plane of rotation (hence, the results\nwould be relevant for observers located at \u03b6obs = 90\u25e6 ). Fig. 7 shows how \u03b5esc varies\nwith location of the emission point across the polar cap.

The escape energy \u03b5esc of photons from the polar cap surface of an orthogonal\nrotator with Bpc = 1012 G is shown as a function of normalized magnetic colatitude\n\u03b8/\u03b8pc of the emission points. The points are assumed to lay along the cross-section of\nthe polar cap surface with the equatorial plane of rotation, thus location of each point\nis determined by \u03b8/\u03b8pc in the range [0, 1], and the magnetic azimuth \u03c6m equal either to\n\u03c0/2 (for the leading half of the polar cap) or \u2212\u03c0/2 (for the trailing half). Three solid\nlines are labelled with the corresponding spin periods P of 0.1 s, 10 ms, and 1.5 ms.\nMoreover, to illustrate the difference with the case when rotational effects are ignored,\neach solid line is accompanied by a dashed line drawn according to eq.(5).\nis determined by the normalized magnetic colatitude \u03b8/\u03b8pc in the range [0, 1] and the\nmagnetic azimuth \u03c6m equal either to \u03c0/2 (for the leading half of the polar cap) or \u2212\u03c0/2\n(for the trailing half). The spin periods of 0.1 s, 10 ms, and 1.5 ms were considered.\nIn order to quantify the asymmetry in \u03b5esc between the leading and the trailing parts\nof the polar cap we introduce the following parameter:\nResc (\u03b8) =\n\n\u03b5tp\nesc\n\u03b5lp\nesc\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\u03b5lp\nesc \u2261 \u03b5esc (\u03c6m = \u03c0/2, \u03b8),\n\u03b5tp\nesc \u2261 \u03b5esc (\u03c6m = \u2212\u03c0/2, \u03b8).\n\n(8)\n\nFor example, Resc (\u03b8pc ) gives the asymmetry between two opposite points located on the\nouter rim of the polar cap. For spin periods around 0.1 s, typical for the known gammaray pulsars, Resc (\u03b8pc ) remains close to unity; e.g. for the case of P = 0.1 s in Fig.7,\n\n\f16\n\nJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\nResc (\u03b8pc ) \u2243 1.3. However, for P smaller than 0.01 s the parameter Resc (\u03b8pc ) becomes\ndefinitely larger: \u223c 2.5 for P = 0.01 s and \u223c 30 for P = 1.5 ms. Thus, for pulsars with\n\nP <\n\u223c 0.01 s and large inclination angles \u03b1 we predict a notable difference (in excess of\nhalf a decade in photon energy) between the positions of high-energy spectral cutoff in\nthe gamma-ray emission from the leading and the trailing part of the polar cap.\nAnother interesting implication of fast rotation is that \u03b5esc has finite values for any\n\u03b8, including \u03b8 = 0 (the magnetic pole), in contrast to the 'static' case of eq. (5). This can\nunderstood in the following way: consider emission points with decreasing colatitude \u03b8 in\nthe leading part of the polar cap. As we approach the dipole axis (\u03b8 \u2192 0), \u03b5esc increases\nbecause the decreasing curvature of magnetic field lines leads to smaller angles between\nB \u2032 and the photon propagation direction \u03b7\u0302 \u2032 in the corotating frame CF. However, photon\ntrajectory bends backwards in the CF (see dashed lines in Fig. 1), which implies that also\n\u2032\nphotons emitted at \u03b8 = 0 along the straight dipolar axis will quickly encounter B\u22a5\n6= 0,\n\nthus being subject to the magnetic absorption. Entering now the trailing part of the polar\ncap leads to further increase of \u03b5esc . This is because magnetic field lines start to bend in\nthe same direction as the photon trajectory in the CF (in other words - the efficiency of\nabsorption decreases for emission points in the trailing part of the polar cap). Eventually,\nat some point (we denote it as \u03b80 ) the escape energy reaches a maximum. This is the\npoint where the magnetic field slippage along with the aberration of photon direction\nensure small angles between B \u2032 and \u03b7\u0302 \u2032 over large distances in the photon trajectory.\nTherefore, the faster is the rotation, the larger is the colatitude \u03b80 of that point. For\nexample, \u03b80 /\u03b8pc \u2243 0.15 for P = 0.1 s whereas \u03b80 /\u03b8pc \u2243 0.42 for P = 0.01 s (see Fig. 7).\nFor P = 1.5 ms this maximum occurs\n\n3\n\nclose to the outer rim (in the trailing part) and\n\ntherefore huge asymmetry with respect to the leading rim is predicted: Resc (\u03b8pc ) \u2243 30.\nWith further increase of \u03b8 (towards the trailing rim of the polar cap) local magnetic field\nlines start to bend stronger than the photon trajectory in the CF, and this is why \u03b5esc\n3\n\nIt is easy to reproduce the behaviour of \u03b80 /\u03b8pc as a function of P in Fig. 7 with analytic\n\nformula: The maximal value of B\u22a5 (r)/Bpc encountered in a static dipolar field by a photon\nemitted along the local field line at \u03b80 is approximately equal to 0.1 \u03b80 (Sturrock 1971, also\nFig.1 in Rudak & Ritter 1994). This occurs always at r0 = 4/3 RNS , regardless the value of\n\u03b80 . The angle \u03c8 between the photon propagation direction and the local field line at r0 is\n\u2032\n\u03c80 \u2248 B\u22a5 (r0 )/B(r0 ) and therefore \u03c80 \u2248 0.1 \u03b80 (4/3)3 . To minimize B\u22a5\n(r0 ) as much as possible\n\nin the case of rotation, the aberration angle due to local linear velocity \u03b2(r0 ) = 4/3 RNS /Rlc\nshould be close to \u03c80 . Since \u03b2(r0 ) \u226a 1, the aberration angle is \u223c \u03b2(r0 ). Therefore, we obtain\n2\nthe condition 0.1 (4/3)2 \u03b80 \u2248 \u03b8pc\nwhich gives\n\n\u03b80\n\u2248 0.08 P \u22121/2 .\n\u03b8pc\nThis formula overestimates the locations of maxima in Fig. 7 by a factor \u223c 2 only.\n\n(9)\n\n\fJ.

This\n\nenergy was calculated for a fixed position \u03b8fxd of emission point, in order to highlight\nits dependence on rotation. We chose three pairs of oppositely located emission points\nat: \u03b8fxd = 2\u25e6 .6, 8\u25e6 .3, and 22\u25e6 , which corespond to \u03b8pc for P = 0.1 s, 10 ms, and 1.5 ms,\nrespectively. As in Fig. 7, the emission points were placed at the neutron star surface,\nin the equatorial plane of orthogonal rotator.

As rotation becomes faster (P around \u223c 0.1\ntp\ns) \u03b5lp\nesc (\u03b8fxd ) and \u03b5esc (\u03b8fxd ) start to diverge due to the asymmetric influence of E.

For increasing \u03b8fxd (2\u25e6 .6,\n8\u25e6 .3, and 22\u25e6 in Fig. 8), the asymmetry parameter Resc (\u03b8fxd ) decreases for slow rotators\n\n(P >\n\u223c 0.1 s), and it increases for fast (millisecond) rotators.\n\n\f18\n\nJ.

Note, that unlike in Fig. 8, the emission points are now placed at\n\u03b8 = \u03b8pc , i.e. at the rim of polar cap corresponding to P . In the case of small inclinations\n(eg. \u03b1 = 10\u25e6 ), the resulting ratio Resc (\u03b8pc ) remains close to unity even for millisecond\nperiods. The general increase in \u03b5esc with P increasing, noticeable in Fig. 9, reflects the\napproach of emission points to the dipole axis, where the curvature of magnetic field\n\u221a\nlines is small. The trend is well described by \u03b5esc \u221d P as given by eq. (6). In the range\n\n\u25e6\nlp\ntp\nof spin periods below \u223c 0.1 s and with \u03b1 >\n\u223c 45 , the difference between \u03b5esc and \u03b5esc\n\nbecomes pronounced, especially for highly inclined millisecond pulsars. If detected by\nGLAST, high-energy emission from such objects would provide an ideal test of the polar\ncap model.\nHowever, for the asymmetry effects to be detectable, an additional condition (apart\nfrom short period and large inclination) must be fulfilled: the viewing geometry must\nbe of the 'on-beam' type, i.e. the observer's line of sight must cross the narrow beam of\nradiation at the high-energy cutoff - where the magnetic absorption operates. If this is\nthe case, the asymmetry in the absorption may be noticeable even in the phase-averaged\nspectra. As an example, we show in Fig. 10 the phase-averaged spectrum calculated for\na millisecond pulsar with P = 2.3 ms, Bpc = 109 G, \u03b1 = 60\u25e6 , and for \u03b6obs = 60\u25e6 .

The density distribution\nof primary electrons over the polar cap, which was assumed in this calculation, had a\nmaximum at the polar cap rim and was uniform in magnetic azimuth \u03c6m . The magnetic\ncolatitude profile of this distribution had a gaussian shape centered at \u03b8 = \u03b8pc , with a\nwidth \u03c3 = 0.05 \u03b8pc . The initial energy of primary electrons was equal to 2 * 107 MeV.\nNote the step-like decline near \u223c 100 GeV.\n\nleading and the trailing peak the spectrum at its high-energy cutoff assumes a step-like\nshape: below \u2243 105 MeV the spectrum consists of photons from both the leading and\n\nthe trailing peak, whereas between \u223c 105 MeV and \u223c 5 * 105 MeV only photons of the\ntrailing peak contribute to the spectrum; at \u03b5 \u2243 \u03b5lp\nesc the level of the spectrum drops by\n\na factor of \u223c 2. In these particular calculations of the spectrum, we assumed that the\ndensity distribution of primary electrons over the polar cap is dominated by an outer-rim\ncomponent (see the captions to Fig. 10 for details of the distribution).\nIf, however, an emission from the inner part of the polar cap were to contribute\nconsiderably to the outer-rim emission, the step-like shape shown in Fig. 10 would be\nsmoothed out, because of contribution of many spectra with different values of \u03b5esc . In\nsuch a case the polar cap origin of the observed radiation could be easily revealed by\nnoting strong differences between the high-energy spectral cutoffs in different ranges of\nthe rotational phase (i.e. phase-resolved spectra would have to be obtained). The first\nobvious candidate to check for this effect (e.g. with GLAST) seems to be J0218+4232 \u2013\nthe only gamma-ray pulsar among all millisecond pulsars (Kuiper et al. 2000). However,\nthis pulsar appears to be a candidate for an 'off-beam' case (see Dyks & Rudak 2002 for\ndetails).\n\n\f20\n\nJ. Dyks & B.

The magnetic field only acts as a scaling factor: \u03b5esc \u221d B \u22121 ;\ncf. eq. (6).\n\n6. Discussion\nWe have shown that pulsar rotation induces an asymmetry in the magnetic absorption\nrate with respect to the magnetic dipole axis. Its consequences are potentially interesting\nin constraining the phase-space of parameters in the polar cap models of high-energy radiation, provided that very high quality gamma-ray data (e.g. as expected from GLAST)\nare at hand. Its magnitude depends mainly on the linear velocity \u03b2 of the magnetosphere at sites of particle acceleration and magnetic photon absorption. When the region\nof electron acceleration is placed just above the neutron star surface rotation does not\nproduce any detectable effects even for relatively fast rotating young gamma-ray pulsars.\nHowever, it has been argued that at least in the case of the Vela pulsar, such a situation\nis difficult to reconcile with the spectral high-energy cutoff at about 10 GeV (e.g. Dyks\net al. 2001). We find then that raising the accelerator up to \u223c 4 neutron star radii (in the\nspirit of Harding & Muslimov 1998) above its polar cap produces asymmetric gamma-ray\npulse profiles even in the case of nearly aligned rotators with a spin period of P \u223c 0.1 s.\nThe resulting features - softer spectrum of the leading peak and the dominance of the\ntrailing peak above \u223c 5 GeV - do agree qualitatively with the EGRET data of the bright\ngamma-ray pulsars (Thompson 2001).\nWe are far from concluding that the rotation effects alone can account for the observed\nasymmetry in the double peaks of the bright EGRET pulsars. On the contrary - some\naxial asymmetry intrinsic to the region of electron acceleration is inevitable in order to\nexplain the double-peak properties at 100 MeV of Geminga and B1706-44, where the\nleading peak is weaker than the trailing peak. Strong deviations of the actual magnetic\nfield structure from the pure dipole at the stellar surface (eg. Gil et al. 2002) might be\nresponsible for maintaining axial asymmetry at the site of electron acceleration (unlike\nthe symmetric initial conditions introduced in Section 2). This in turn would lead to\nelectromagnetic cascades whose properties vary with magnetic azimuth. It is important,\nhowever, that the propagation effects due to rotation work in the right direction, i.e. they\nexplain qualitatively the observed weakening of the leading peak with respect to the\ntrailing peak. We emphasize that this weakening occurs only in the vicinity of the (phaseaveraged) high-energy spectral cutoff, where the flux level decreases significantly.\nAnother consequence of the magnetic absorption of high energy photons is a noticeable\nchange in the separation \u2206peak between the two peaks in the pulse, taking place near the\nhigh-energy spectral cutoff (Dyks & Rudak 2000). In the model discussed above, with\nelectrons ejected only from a rim of the polar cap, the higher energy of photons requires\n\n\fJ. Dyks & B. Rudak: Asymmetry in the lightcurves of EGRET pulsars\n\n21\n\nhigher emission altitudes to avoid absorption. Therefore, a slight increase in \u2206peak is\nvisible in the three lowermost pulse profiles in Fig. 3 b. However, if the emission from the\ninterior of the polar cap were included, just the opposite behaviour would occur: \u2206peak\nwould decrease near the high-energy cutoff in the spectrum. This is because in this case\nof a \"filled polar cap tube\", the highest energy non-absorbed photons are emitted closer\nto the magnetic dipole axis (see Fig. 2 in Dyks & Rudak 2000). The latter case agrees\nqualitatively with the marginal decrease in peak separation found in the EGRET data\nfor Vela (Kanbach 1999).\nStimulated by high-quality observations of gamma-ray pulsars anticipated with\nGLAST we analysed in Sect. 5 the importance of rotation-driven asymmetry in magnetic absorption for a broad range of pulsar parameters. A decline in gamma-ray flux\nat high-energy spectral cutoff should inevitably be accompanied by strong changes in\npulse profiles: whereas at lower photon energies the profile is determined by the density\ndistribution of primary electrons over the polar cap and the efficiency of photon emission\nmechanism, in the vicinity of the cutoff it becomes additionally constrained by likely\nhigh values of the asymmetry parameter Resc (\u03b8pc ) - the situation anticipated for fastly\n\u25e6\nrotating (P < 0.01 s), and highly inclined (\u03b1 >\n\u223c 45 ) pulsars.\n\nAcknowledgements.
