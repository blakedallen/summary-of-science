Assuming that the jets are aligned with the spin of the black hole\n(BH) at their origin these sources can be explained by rapid realignment\nof the jet: The coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (BHB), a\nproduct of a galaxy merger, quickly realigns the jet (. 107 yr), with the spin\nof the merged black hole being dominated by the orbital angular momentum\nof the BHB [3, 4, 5, 1]. In at least two XRGs (NGC 326 and 3C 52) the\nridges of the secondary lobes have been observed to be offset from each other\nlaterally by about their width, hence showing a Z-shaped symmetry about\nthe nucleus. As the galaxy merger proceeds and the captured galaxy spirals\nto the common center it induces a rotational stream-field in the ISM on large\nscales. If its trajectory passes through the polar regions of the primary galaxy,\nthe ram pressure of the rotating ISM bends the original jet into Z-shape [2].\n\n2 Deprojection of ZRGs & Results\nBecause the pre-merger spin of the primary BH and the orbital angular momentum of the merging BHB are not correlated the distribution of the angle\nbetween them is \u221d sin \u03b8jet , peaking at 90\u25e6 . Since the post-merger spin is\ndominated by the orbital angular momentum, the angle between pre- and\npost-merger jet follows the same distribution. This corresponds to the requirement that in Z-shaped radio galaxies (ZRGs) the secondary's trajectory\npasses through the polar regions of the primary galaxy. Spiralling inwards\nthe ram pressure of the rotating ISM balances that of the jet in a distance r\nand the jet, with a power close to the FR I/II transition, will be bent into a\nZ-shape.\nWith the observed projected lateral offset of the ridges yp in the known\ndistance D of the galaxy we can determine the angle \u03b8jet between the preand post-merger jets in dependence on the bending radius r and the angle\n\u03b8los between our line of sight (LOS) and the post-merger jet. There are three\npossible orientations of the jets and the LOS relative to each other. The\n\n\f2\n\nChristian Zier\n\nrequirement of \u03b8jet and \u03b8los to be large (& 60\u25e6 ) imposes certain limits on the\nbending radius: Only for r & yp /2 first the orientation with both, the LOS\nand the receding part of the pre-merger jet in the same hemisphere, which\nis \u221a\ndefind by the post-merger jet as polar axis, becomes possible. At r \u2248\nyp 3/2 also both other orientations enter the region of allowed angles, but\nare less likely. For NGC 326 and 3C 52 we obtain the limiting radii 10, 17 kpc\nand 25, 43 kpc respectively [6]. This result, based on geometrical arguments\nonly, is consistent with the location of \u223c 50 kpc where the ram pressure of\na FR I/II-jet equates that of the rotating ISM. The peoperties of the gas\nstream which are required to bend the jet in Z-shape (M \u2248 109 M\u2299 , v \u2248\n200 km/s, r \u2248 30\u2013100 kpc) are also in very good agreement with observations\nand numerical simulations of galaxy mergers (see references in [6]).\n\n3 Discussion & Conclusions\nOur results strongly support to the merger model for XRGs, and ZRGs as\na special subclass with \u03b8jet \u2248 90\u25e6 . They also strengthen the conjecture that\na jet is aligned with the spin of the BH at its base and that the jet flips\ninto the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the pre-merger BHB.\nWe also could restrict the bending radius to the range 30\u2013100 kpc. Another\nimportant result is that most likely the LOS and the receding part of the\npre-merger jet are in the same hemisphere whose polar axis is defined by the\npost-merger jet. Knowing the correct orientation we also know the sense of\nrotation and consequently the direction of the spin of the post-merger BH.\nThese conclusions have also an important impact on the conjecture favoured\nby some authors that after a merger of two galaxies the decay of the BHB\nstalls due to the depletion of the so-called loss cone. In contradiction the\nexistence of XRGs and ZRGs proves that the binary has merged. In ZRGs it\nprobably merges on timescales of some 108 yr after the bending of the jet in\na distance of about 50 kpc. Thus, in a way, the bending starts a stop watch\nfor the rest of the merger.
