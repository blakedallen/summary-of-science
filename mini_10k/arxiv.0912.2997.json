Cosmic Depressions\nVoids have been known as a feature of galaxy surveys since the first surveys were\ncompiled 15,37,25. Voids are enormous regions with sizes in the range of 20 \u2212 50h\u22121\nMpc that are practically devoid of any galaxy, usually roundish in shape and occupying the major share of space in the Universe. Forming an essential ingredient\nof the Cosmic Web 11 , they are surrounded by elongated filaments, sheetlike walls\nand dense compact clusters. Following the discovery by Ref. 60 and 61 of the most\ndramatic specimen, the Bo\u00f6tes void, a hint of their central position within a weblike\narrangement came with the first CfA redshift slice 65 . This view has been dramatically endorsed and expanded by the redshift maps of the 2dFGRS and SDSS surveys\n17,104 . They have established voids as an integral component of the Cosmic Web.\nThe 2dFGRS maps and SDSS maps (see e.g. fig. 1) are telling illustrations of the\nubiquity and prominence of voids in the cosmic galaxy distribution.\nIn a void-based description of the evolution of the cosmic matter distribution,\nvoids mark the transition scale at which density perturbations have decoupled from\n1\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nFig. 1. SDSS is the largest and most systematic sky survey in the history of astronomy. It\nis a combination of a sky survey in 5 optical bands of 25% of the celestial (northern) sphere.\nEach image is recorded on CCDs in these 5 bands. On the basis of the images/colours and their\nbrightness a million galaxies are subsequently selected for spectroscopic follow-up. The total sky\narea covered by SDSS is 8452 square degrees. Objects will be recorded to mlim = 23.1. In total\nthe resulting atlas will contain 108 stars, 108 galaxies and 105 quasars. Spectra are taken of\naround 106 galaxies, 105 quasars and 105 unusual stars (in our Galaxy). Of the 5 public data\nreleases 4 have been accomplished, ie. 6670 square degrees of images is publicly available, along\nwith 806,400 spectra. In total, the sky survey is now completely done (107%), the spectroscopic\nsurvey for 68%. This image is taken from a movie made by Subbarao, Surendran & Landsberg\n(see website: http://astro.uchicago.edu/cosmus/projects/sloangalaxies/). It depicts the resulting\nredshift distribution after the 3rd public data release.

On the basis\nof theoretical models of void formation one might infer that voids may act as the key\norganizing element for arranging matter concentrations into an all-pervasive cosmic\nnetwork 55,86,114,97 . As voids expand, matter is squeezed in between them, and\nsheets and filaments form the void boundaries. This view is supported by numerical\nstudies and computer simulations of the gravitational evolution of voids in more\ncomplex and realistic configurations 68,86,24,115,33,16,71 . A marked example of\nthe evolution of a typical large and deep void in a \u039bCDM scenarios is given by the\ntime sequence of six frames in fig. 2.\nSoon after their discovery, various studies pointed out their essential role in\nthe organization of the cosmic matter distribution 55,86 . Their effective repulsive\ninfluence over their surroundings has been recognized in various galaxy surveys in\nthe Local Universe.\n1.1. Voids: cosmological importance\nThere are a variety of reasons why the study of voids is interesting for our understanding of the cosmos.\n\u2022 They are a prominent aspect of the Megaparsec Universe, instrumental in the\nspatial organization of the Cosmic Web.\n\u2022 Voids contain a considerable amount of information on the underlying cosmological scenario and on global cosmological parameters. Notable cosmological\nimprints are found in the outflow velocities and accompanying redshift distortions 22,68,90 . Also their intrinsic structure, shape and mutual alignment are\nsensitive to the cosmology, including that of dark energy 74,66,81 . The cosmological ramifications of the reality of a supersized voids akin to the identified\nones by ref. 89 and ref. 35 would obviously be far-reaching.\n\u2022 The pristine low-density environment of voids represents an ideal and pure setting for the study of galaxy formation and the influence of cosmic environment\non the formation of galaxies. Voids are in particular interesing following the observation by Peebles that the dearth of low luminosity objects in voids is hard\nto understand within the \u039bCDM cosmology 78 .\n1.2. Void Sizes\nFor the most systematic and complete impression of the cosmic void population\nthe Local Universe provides the most accessible region. Recently, the deep view\nof the 2dFGRS and SDSS probes (see fig. 1) has been supplemented with highresolution studies of voids in the nearby Universe. Based upon the 6dF survey 45 ,\nFairall (person. commun.) identified nearly all voids within the surveyed region out\nto 35, 000 km s\u22121 . It is the 2MASS redshift survey 52 \u2013 the densest all-sky redshift\nsurvey available \u2013 which has provided a uniquely detailed and complete census of\nlarge scale structures in our Local Universe 29 .\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n4\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nVoids in the galaxy distribution account for about 95% of the total volume\n58,27,28,49,83,88,80 . The typical sizes of voids in the galaxy distribution depend on\nthe galaxy population used to define the voids. Voids defined by galaxies brighter\nthan a typical L\u2217 galaxy tend to have diameters of order 10 \u2212 20h\u22121Mpc, but voids\nassociated with rare luminous galaxies can be considerably larger; diameters in the\nrange of 20h\u22121 \u2212 50h\u22121 Mpc are not uncommon 49,83 . Firm upper limits on the\nmaximum void size have not yet been set. Recently there have been claims of the\nexistence of a supersized void, in the counts of the NVVS catalogue of radio sourcs,\nand of its possible imprint on the CMB via the ISW effect in the form of a 5\u25e6 CMB\n'Cold Spot' 89 . A systematic search for such supervoids, and superclusters, in the\nLuminous Red Galaxy (LRGs) sample from the SDSS survey has indeed provided\none of the strongest claims for a significant (4\u03c3) detection of the ISW effect in the\nWMAP maps 35,36 . If this will be confirmed it will pose an interesting challenge\nto concordance cosmological scenarios 53 .\nAt the low end side of the void size distribution, a few studies claim to have found\nwhat may be the smallest genuine voids in existence. On the basis of the Catalog\nof Neighbouring Galaxies 57 , ref. 106 identified a total of some 30 minivoids, each\ncompletely devoid of galaxies, with sizes of 0.7 \u2212 3.5h\u22121 Mpc.\n2. Formation and Evolution of Voids\nAt any cosmic epoch the voids that dominate the spatial matter distribution are a\nmanifestation of the cosmic structure formation process reaching a non-linear stage\nof evolution.\nVoids emerge out of the density troughs in the primordial Gaussian field of density fluctuations. Early theoretical models of void formation concentrated on the\nevolution of isolated voids 47,55,5,8 . As a result of their underdensity voids represent a region of weaker gravity, resulting in an effective repulsive peculiar gravitational influence. Initially underdense regions therefore expand faster than the\nHubble flow, and thus expand with respect to the background Universe. Fig. 2 illustrates the evolution of a spherical isolated void. As matter streams out of the void,\nthe density within the void decreases, with isolated voids asymptotically evolving\ntowards an underdensity \u03b4 = \u22121, pure emptiness. The same expanding and evacuating behaviour of void regions apply in the far more complex circumstances of\nthe real cosmic matter distribution. The illustration of a void in a \u039bCDM Universe\nis illustrated in fig. 2 by a sequence of 6 timesteps. Because the density within\nunderdense regions gradually increases outward, we see a decrease of the corresponding peculiar (outward) gravitational acceleration: void matter in the centre\nmoves outward faster than void matter towards the boundary. This leads to matter\naccumulating in ridges which surround the void, while the interior evolves into a\nuniform low-density region resembling a low-density homogeneous FRW Universe.\nThe steepness of the resulting density profile depends on the protovoid depression\n72 . In nearly all conceivable situations the void therefore appears to assume a bucket\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n5\n\nshape, with a uniform interior density depression and a steep outer boundary (fig. 2,\nright frame).\nA characteristic evolutionary timescale for voids is that of shellcrossing. This\nhappens when interior shells of matter take over initially exterior shells. Ref. 5\ndemonstrated that once voids have passed the stage of shellcrossing they enter\na phase of self-similar expansion (fig. 2). Subsequently, their expansion will slow\ndown with respect to the earlier linear expansion. This impelled ref. 8 to identify\nvoids in the present-day galaxy distribution with voids that have just reached the\nstage of shell-crossing. It happens when a primordial density depression attains\na linearly extrapolated underdensity \u03b4v = fv = \u22122.81 (for an EdS universe, see\nsec 4.1). A perfectly spherical \"bucket\" void will have expanded by a factor of 1.72\nat shellcrossing, and therefore have evolved into an underdensity of \u223c 20% of the\nglobal cosmological density, ie. \u03b4v,nl = \u22120.8. In other words, the voids that we\nsee nowadays in the galaxy distribution do probably correspond to regions whose\ndensity is \u223c 20% of the mean cosmic density (note that it may be different for\nunderdensity in the galaxy distribution).\nNote that while by definition voids correspond to density perturbations of at\nmost unity, |\u03b4v | \u2264 1, mature voids in the nonlinear matter distribution do represent highly nonlinear features. This may be best understood within the context of\nLagrangian perturbation theory 92 . Overdense fluctuations may be described as a\nconverging series of higher order perturbations. The equivalent perturbation series\n\nFig. 2. Spherical model for the evolution of voids. Left: a pure (uncompensated) tophat void\nevolving up to the epoch of shell-crossing.

Shell-crossing, and the formation of a ridge, happens only if the initial profile is\nsufficiently steep.\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n6\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nFig. 3.

Void Dynamics\nFigure 4 shows a typical void-like region in a \u039bCDM Universe. It concerns a 2563\nparticles GIF N -body simulation 59 , encompassing a \u039bCDM (\u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b =\n0.7, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc) density field within a (periodic) cubic box with length\n141h\u22121Mpc and produced by means of an adaptive P3 M N -body code.\nThe top left frame shows the particle distribution in and around the void within\nthis 42.5h\u22121 Mpc wide and 1h\u22121 Mpc thick slice through the simulation box. In the\nsame figure we include panels of the density and velocity field in the void, determined\nby means of a DTFE reconstruction 94,93,116 . The void region appears as a slowly\nvarying region of low density (top righthand frame). Notice the clear distinction\nbetween the empty(dark) interior regions of the void and its edges. In the interior\nof the void several smaller subvoids can be distinguished, with boundaries consisting\nof low density filamentary or planar structures.\nThe general characteristics of the expanding void are most evident when following the density and velocity profile along a one-dimensional section through the\nvoid. The bottom-left frame of fig. 4 shows these profiles for the linear section along\nthe solid line indicated in the other three frames. The density profile does confirm\nto the general trend of low-density regions to develop a near uniform interior density surrounded by sharply defined boundaries. Nonetheless, we see that the void is\ninterspersed by a rather pronounced density enhancement near its centre.\nThe flow in and around the void is dominated by the outflow of matter from the\nvoid, culminating into the void's own expansion near the outer edge. The comparison with the top two frames demonstrates the strong relation with features in the\nparticle distribution and the density field. Not only it is slightly elongated along\nthe direction of the void's shape, but it is also sensitive to some prominent internal\nfeatures of the void. Towards the \"SE\" direction the flow appears to slow down near\na ridge, near the centre the DTFE reconstruction identifies two expansion centres.\nThe void velocity field profile is intimately coupled to that of its density field. The\nlinear velocity increase is a manifestation of its general expansion. The near constant\nvelocity divergence within the void conforms to the super-Hubble flow expected for\nthe near uniform interior density distribution. Because voids are emptier than the\nrest of the universe they will expand faster than the rest of the universe with a net\nvelocity divergence equal to\n\u03b8 =\n\n\u2207*v\n= 3(\u03b1 \u2212 1) ,\nH\n\n\u03b1 = Hvoid /H ,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is defined to be the ratio of the super-Hubble expansion rate of the void\nand the Hubble expansion of the universe.\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n8\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nFig. 4.

The reconstruction of the density and velocity field in our local cosmos\non the basis of the 2MASS redshift survey has indeed resulted in a very interesting\nand complete view of the dynamics on Megaparsec scales. This conclusion agree\nwith that reached on the basis of an analysis of the peculiar velocity of the Local\nGroup by ref. 109.

Void Shapes and Tides\nRef. 55 pointed out that any (isolated) aspherical underdensity will become more\nspherical as it expands. The effective gravitational acceleration is stronger along the\nshort axis than along the longer axes. For overdensities this results in a stronger\ninward acceleration and infall, producing increasingly flattened and elongated features. By contrast, for voids this translates into a larger outward acceleration along\nthe shortest axis so that asphericities will tend to diminish. For the interior of voids\nthis tendency has been confirmed by N-body simulations 115 .\nIn reality, voids will never reach sphericity. Even though voids tend to be less\nflattened or elongated than the halos in the dark matter distribution, they are\nnevertheless quite nonspherical: ref. 81 find that they are slightly prolate with axis\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n11\n\nratios of the order of c : b : a \u2248 0.5 : 0.7 : 1. This agrees with the statement by ref. 95\nand ref. 74 that in realistic cosmological circumstances voids will be nonspherical.\nThis is also quite apparent in images of, for example, the Millennium simulation 99 .\nThe flattening is a result of large scale dynamical and environmental factors,\namongst which we can identify at least two important factors 81 . Even while their\ninternal dynamics pushes them to a more spherical shape they will never be able\nto reach perfect sphericity before encountering surrounding structures such as overdense filaments or planar walls. Even more important may be the fact that, for\nvoids, external tidal influences remain important: voids will always be rather moderate densities perturbations since they can never be more underdense than \u03b4 = \u22121.\nExternal tidal forces are responsible for a significant anisotropic effect in the development of the voids. In extreme cases they may even cause complete collapse of the\nvoid.\n\nFig. 7. Anisotropic Void Expansion and Collapse.

Ellipsoidal Voids\nThe major influence of external tidal forces on the evolution of voids can be understood by assessing the evolution of homogeneous underdense ellipsoids 55 . To\nsome extent, the Homogeneous Ellipsoidal Model 54,117,26,10,23 represents a better\ndescription for the evolution of voids than that of collapsing overdense peaks. Overdense regions contract into more compact and hence steeper density peaks, so that\nthe area in which the ellipsoidal model represents a reasonable approximation will\ncontinuously shrink. On the other hand, we have seen the natural tendency of voids\nis to develop an increasingly uniform interior density field (see fig. 2): while they\nexpand their interior gets drained of matter and develops a flat \"bucket-shaped\"\ndensity profile.\nIn many respects the homogeneous model is a better approximation for underdense regions than it is for overdense ones. Evidently, the approximation is restricted\nto the interior and fails at the void's outer fringes because of its neglect of the domineering role of surrounding material, such as the sweeping up of matter and the\nencounter with neighbouring features.\nThe homogeneous ellipsoidal model assumes an object to be a region with a\ntriaxially symmetric ellipsoidal geometry and a homogeneous interior density, embedded within a uniform background density \u03c1u . Consider the simple situation of\nthe external tidal shear directed along the principal axes of the ellipsoid. The gravitational acceleration along the principal axes of an ellipsoid with over/underdensity\n\u03b4 can be evaluated from the expression for the corresponding scale factors Ri ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n2\n1+\u03b4\nd2 Rm\n=\n\u22124\u03c0G\u03c1\n(t)\n+\n(\u03b1\n\u2212\n)\n\u03b4\nRm \u2212 \u03c4m Rm + \u039bRm , (3)\nu\nm\n3\n2\n3\ndt2\nwhere we have also taken into account the influence of the cosmological constant \u039b.\nThe factors \u03b1m (t) are the ellipsoidal coefficients specified by the integral equation,\nZ \u221e\nd\u03bb\n\u03b1m (t) = R1 (t)R2 (t)R3 (t)\n(4)\nY3\n\u00011/2 .\n0 (R2 (t) + \u03bb)\nR2n (t) + \u03bb\nm\nn=1\n\n(ext)\n\nThe influence of the external (large-scale) tidal shear tensor Tmn enters via the\neigenvalue \u03c4m . From eqn. 3, it is straightforward to appreciate that as \u03b4 grows\nstrongly nonlinear, the relative influence of the large-scale (near-)linear tidal field\nwill decline. However, the density deficit \u03b4 of voids will never exceed unity, |\u03b4| < 1,\nso that the importance of the factor \u03c4m remains relatively large. Its impact can be\nso strong that it not only effects an anisotropic expansion of the void, but even may\nmanage to make an initially spherically expanding void to collapse (see fig. 7).\n3.2.2. Void Alignments\nLarge scale tidal influences not only manifest themselves in the shaping of individual voids. They are also responsible for a distinct alignment of substructures along\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n13\n\na preferred direction, while they are also instrumental in their mutual arrangement and organization. Locally, the orientation of a void turns out to be strongly\naligned with the tidal force field generated by structures on scales up to at least\n20 \u2212 30h\u22121 Mpc. This goes along with a similar mutual alignment amongst voids\nthemselves. They have strongly correlated orientations over distances > 30h\u22121 Mpc\n81 , a scale considerably exceeding the typical void size. It forms a strong confirmation of the large scale tidal force field as the dominant agent for the evolution and\nspatial organization of the Megaparsec Universe, as emphasized by the Cosmic Web\ntheory 11 .\n4. Void Sociology\nComputer simulations of the gravitational evolution of voids in realistic cosmological\nenvironments do show a considerably more complex situation than that described\nby idealized spherical or ellipsoidal models 68,86,24,115,33,16,71 . In recent years\nthe huge increase in computational resources has enabled N-body simulations to\nresolve in detail the intricate substructure of voids within the context of hierarchical cosmological structure formation scenarios 70,34,46,2,33,16,71 . They confirm\nthe theoretical expectation of voids having a rich substructure as a result of their\nhierarchical buildup (see e.g. fig. 2).\nRef. 97 treated the emergence and evolution of voids within the context of hierarchical gravitational scenarios. It leads to a considerably modified view of the\nevolution of voids. The role of substructure within their interior and the interaction\nwith their surroundings turn out to be essential aspects of the hierarchical evolution\nof the void population in the Universe. An important guideline are the heuristic void\nmodel simulations by ref. 24, and the theoretical void study by ref. 91 within the\ncontext of a Lagrangian adhesion model approach by ref. 91. As argued by ref. 97,\nthe hierarchical development of voids, akin to the evolution of overdense halos, may\nbe described by an excursion set formulation 85,9,96 .\nIn some sense voids have a considerably more complex evolutionary path than\noverdense halos. Two processes dictate the evolution of voids: their merging into\never larger voids as well as the collapse and disappearance of small ones embedded\nin overdense regions (see fig. 8).\n4.0.3. Void Merging\nFirst, consider a small region which was less dense than the critical void density\nvalue. It may be that this region is embedded in a significantly larger underdense\nregion which is also less dense than the critical density. Many small primordial density troughs may exist within the larger void region. Once small density depressions\nlocated within a larger embedding underdensity have emerged as true voids at some\nearlier epoch, their expansion tends to slow down.\nWhen the adjacent subvoids meet up, the matter in between is squeezed in\nthin walls and filaments. The peculiar velocities perpendicular to the void walls\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n14\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nFig. 8. The two modes of void evolution: void merging (top row) and void collapse (bottom\nrow). Top: three timesteps of evolving void structure in a 1283 particle N-body simulation of\nstructure formation in an SCDM model (aexp = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5). The sequence shows the gradual\ndevelopment of a large void of diameter \u2248 25h\u22121 Mpc as the complex pattern of smaller voids and\nstructures which had emerged within it at an earlier time, merge with one another. It illustrates\nthe void-in-void process of the evolving void hierarchy. Bottom: a choice of three collapsing voids\nin a constrained N-body simulation, each embedded within an environment of different tidal shear\nstrength. The arrows indicate the velocity vectors, showing the infall of outer regions onto the void\nregion. As a result the voids will be crushed as the surrounding matter rains down on them.\n\nare mostly suppressed so that the flow of matter is mostly confined to tangential\nmotions. The subsequent merging of the subvoids is marked by the gradual fading\nof these structures while matter evacuates along the walls and filaments towards\nthe enclosing boundary of the emerging void 24 (also see top row fig. 8). The\ntimescale on which the internal substructure of the encompassing void is erased\nis approximately the same as that on which it reaches maturity.\nThe final result is the merging and absorption of the subvoids in the larger void\nemerging from the embedding underdensity. Hence, as far as the void population is\nconcerned only the large void counts, while the smaller subvoids should be discarded\nas such. Only a faint and gradually fading imprint of their original outline remains\nas a reminder of the initial internal substructure.\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n15\n\n4.0.4. Void Collapse\nA second void process is responsible for the radical dissimilarity between void and\nhalo populations. If a small scale minimum is embedded in a sufficiently high large\nscale density maximum, then the collapse of the larger surrounding region will\neventually squeeze the underdense region it surrounds: the small-scale void will\nvanish when the region around it has collapsed completely. Alternatively, though\nusually coupled, they may collapse as a result of the tidal force field in which they\nfind themselves. If the void within the contracting overdensity has been squeezed to\nvanishingly small size it should no longer be counted as a void (see fig. 8, bottom\nrow).\nThe collapse of small voids is an important aspect of the symmetry breaking\nbetween underdensities and overdensities. In the primorial Universe, Gaussian primordial conditions involve a perfect symmetry between under- and overdense. Any\ninspection of a galaxy redshift map or an N-body simulation shows that there is\na marked difference between matter clumps and voids. While the number density\nof halos is dominated by small objects, void collapse is responsible for the lack of\nsmall voids.\n4.1. Void Excursions\nMarked by the two processes of merging and collapse, the complex hierarchical\nbuildup of the void population may be modelled by a two-barrier excursion set formalism 97 . The barriers refer to the critical (linear) density thresholds involved with\nthe merging and collapse of voids. Whenever the linearly extrapolated (primordial)\n\u03b4L (~r, t|R) on a scale R,\n\u03b4L (r, t|R) =\n\nD(t)\n\u03b4L (r, ti |R) ,\nD(ti )\n\n(5)\n\nexceeds a density threshold fc it will collapse. For an Einstein-de Sitter \u03a9m = 1\nUniverse the critical value has the well-known value fc \u2243 1.686 40 . A void will\nform when an underdensity reaches the critical density threshold of shell-crossing,\ncorresponding to a value of fv \u2243 \u22122.81 for spherical voids in an Einstein-de Sitter\nUniverse. The linear density growth factor D(t), normalized to unity at the present\nepoch, follows from the integral 44,77,42,64 ,\nZ a\nda\u2032\n5 \u03a9m,0 H02\nH(a)\n(6)\nD(t) = D(t, \u03a9m,0 , \u03a9\u039b,0 ) =\n\u20323\n3 \u2032 .\n2\n0 a H (a )\nEmerging from a primordial Gaussian random field, many small voids may coexist\nwithin one larger void. Small voids from an early epoch will merge with one another\nto form a larger void at a later epoch. The excursion set formalism takes account\nof this void-in-void configuration by discarding these small voids from the void\ncount. To account for the impact of voids disappearing when embedded in collapsing\nregions, the two-barrier formalism also deals with the void-in-cloud problem.\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n16\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nBy contrast, the evolution of overdensities is governed only by the cloud-incloud process; the cloud-in-void process is much less important, because clouds\nwhich condense in a large scale void are not torn apart as their parent void expands\naround them. This asymmetry between how the surrounding environment affects\nhalo and void formation is incorporated into the excursion set approach by using\none barrier to model halo formation and a second barrier to model void formation.\nOnly the first barrier matters for halo formation, but both barriers play a role in\ndetermining the expected abundance of voids.\nThis image of void formation in the dark matter distribution has been elaborated\nby ref. 30 to describe the implications for voids in the galaxy distribution.\n4.2. Voidpatch Theory\nThe extended Press-Schechter formulation of hierarchical void evolution is a local\ndescription and fails to take into account the proper spatial and geometric setting\nand configuration underlying the process.\nThe peakpatch formalism introduced by ref. 10 represents a more proper nonlocal description of the hierarchical buildup of structures. Framed in an elaborate\nanalytical framework it involves a natural definition of a peaks physical extension,\nand takes into the account of the anisotropic nature of gravitational collapse and of\nthe relative location and size of peaks in and around evolving density peaks.\nAlong similar lines ref. 82 have phrased a voidpatch formalism to follow the\nhierarchical buildup of voids. It will allow a much better understanding of the configuration, shape and substructure of individual voids emerging in a cosmic density\nfield. It will also help towards the identification of collapsing subvoids and help\ntowards evaluating the impact of the various dynamical influences.\n4.3. Void Population Statistics.\nThe analytical evaluation of the two-barrier random walk problem in the extended\nPress-Schechter approach leads directly to a prediction of the distribution function\nnv (M ) for voids on a mass scale M (or corresponding void size Ra ). The resulting\nvoid spectrumb . is peaked, with a sharp cutoff at both small and large values of the\npeak mass Mv,\u2217 (fig. 9, bottom lefthand frame),\nnv (M ) dM \u2248\nr\na The\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n2 \u03c1u\n\u03bdv (M )\n\u03bdv (M ) exp \u2212\n2\n\u03c0 M\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\u001b\n\u001a\n2\n4\nd ln \u03c3(M )\nD\n|fv | D\n\u22122 4 ,\nexp \u2212\n2\nd ln M\nfc 4\u03bdv\n\u03bdv\n\nconversion of the void mass scale to equivalent void radius R is done by assuming the simplest\napproximation, that of the spherical tophat model.

The large mass cutoff of the void spectrum is similar to the\nones for clusters and reflects the Gaussian nature of the fluctuation field from which\nthe objects have condensed. The characteristic void size increases with time: the\ngradual merging of voids into ever larger ones is embodied in a self-similar shift of\nthe peak of the void spectrum.\nWhen evaluating the corresponding fraction of contained in voids on mass scale\nM, f (M ) = M nv (M )/\u03c1u (top lefthand frame, fig. 9), we see that this also peaks\nat the characteristic void scale. It implies a mass fraction in voids of approximately\nthirty percent of the mass in the Universe, with most of the void mass to be found\nin voids of this characteristic mass.\nWhile the two-barrier excursion set formalism offers an attractive theoretical\nexplanation for the distinct asymmetry between clumps and voids and for the peaked\nvoid size distribution, realistic cosmological simulations are needed to identify where\nthe disappearing small-scale voids are to be found in a genuine evolving cosmic\nmatter distribution. Using the GIF N-body simulations of various CDM scenarios,\nref. 79 has managed to trace various specimen of this unfortunate void population.\nSubvoids in the interior of a larger void tend to merge with surrounding peers while\nthe ones near the boundary get squeezed out of existence. These do not collapse\nisotropically, but tend to get sheared by their surroundings.\nAn important aspect of the implied void population is that it is approximately\nspace-filling. It underlines the adagio that the large scale distribution of matter may\nbe compared to a soapsud of expanding bubbles. This follows from evaluation of the\ncumulative integral\nZ \u221e\nM \u2032 nv (M \u2032 )\ndM \u2032 .\n(9)\nFV (M ) \u2261\n(1.7)3\n\u03c1u\nM\nwhere the factor 1.7 is an estimate of the excess expansion of the void based upon\nthe spherical model for void evolution (see footnote). The top righthand panel of\nfig. 9 shows the resulting (current) cumulative void volume distribution: for a finite\nvalue of void radius R the whole of space indeed appears to be occupied by voids,\nwhile the bottom righthand frame shows the gradual shift of the cumulative volume\ndistribution towards larger voids. In other words, the correct image appears to be\nthat of a gradually unfolding bubbly universe in which the average size of the voids\ngrows as small voids merge into ever larger ones.\n4.4. Void Substructure\nAn important issue within the hierarchically proceeding evolution of voids and the\nCosmic Web is the fate of its substructure. In voids the diluted and diminished\ninfrastructure remains visible, at ever decreasing density contrast, as cinders of\nthe earlier phases of the void hierarchy in which the substructure stood out more\nprominent\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n19\n\nN-body simulations show that voids do retain a rich infrastructure. Examples\nsuch as the top row of fig. 8, and images of the Millennium simulation 99 show that\nwhile void substructure does fade, it does not disappear. We may find structures\nranging from filamentary and sheetlike structures to a population of low mass dark\nmatter halos and galaxies (see e.g. ref. 115 & 34). Although challenging, these may\nalso be seen in the observational reality. The galaxies that populate the voids do\ncurrently attract quite some attention (see next section). Also, the SDSS galaxy\nsurvey has uncovered a substantial level of substructure within the Bo\u00f6tes void,\nconfirming tantative indications for a filamentary feature by ref. 102.\nThe gradual fading of the initially rich substructure as a void expands, and its\nmatter content evacuates its interior, is clearly visible in the development of the\nvoid region in fig. 2. This may be seen as the slowing of structure growth in the\nlow-density environment of voids. In their analytical treatment, ref. 33 described\nhow the evolving substructure in a void could be translated into structure evolving\nin a lower \u03a9 Universe, including the implicit change in spectral characteristics of\nthe density field (see ref. 69 for a reappraisal and criticism of some of the technical\nissues).\nThe resulting observation is one in which the density distribution in a void\nregion undergoes a manifest and continuous transformation towards an ever larger\ndominating scale, while it mostly retains the topological characteristics of the initial\ndensity field. In a sense, it reflects of the buildup of the Cosmic Web itself, its basic\npattern already recognizable in the primordial matter distribution 11 .\n\n5. Void Galaxies\nA major point of interest is that of the galaxies populating the voids, the void galaxies. The pristine environment of voids represents an ideal and pure setting for the\nstudy of galaxy formation. Largely unaffected by the complexities and processes\nmodifying galaxies in high-density environments, the isolated void regions must\nhold important clues to the formation and evolution of galaxies. This has made\nthe study of the relation between void galaxies and their surroundings an important aspect of the recent interest in environmental influences on galaxy formation\n102,63,84,56,38,39,49,50,87,88,105,75,76,14,113,100.\nAmongst the issues relevant for our understanding of galaxy and structure formation, void galaxies have posed several interesting riddles and questions. Arguably\nthe most prominent issue is that of the near absence of low-luminosity galaxies in\nvoids, while \u039bCDM cosmology expects voids to be teeming with dwarfs and low surface brightness galaxies. A manifest environmental influence which still needs to be\nunderstood is the finding that void galaxies appear bluer, a trend which continues\ndown into the most rarefied void regions. Another issue of interest is whether we\ncan observe the intricate filigree of substructure in voids, expected as the remaining\ndebris of the merging voids and filaments in the hierarchical formation process.\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n20\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nFig. 10.

Void galaxy properties\nVoid galaxies do appear to have significantly different properties than average field\ngalaxies. They appear to reside in a more youthful state of star formation and\npossess larger and less distorted supplies of gas. Analysis of void galaxies in the\nSDSS and 2dFGRS indicate that void galaxies are bluer and have higher specific\nstar formation rates than galaxies in denser environments 38,39,87,88,75,73,3,110.\nWhile these trends appear to be quite general, controversy persists in the literature as to whether or not galaxies in voids differ in their internal properties from\nsimilar objects in denser regions. Part of this relates to the selection of void galaxies. There are distinct differences between the majority of these galaxies, residing in\nthe moderate underdense environment near the boundary, and those in the deepest\nrealms, \u03b4 < \u22120.8, where some 10% of the void galaxies resides. The most recent\nresults on the basis of SDSS DR6 110 and 2dFGRS 3 do indicate that these are\nintrinsic differences: at fixed morphology and luminosity the faintest void galaxies\nare intrinsically bluer and have higher star formation rates. It may certainly be true\nthat, following the interpretation by ref. 3, because structure grows more slowly in\nthe low-density environment of voids the galaxy population in voids is younger. An\nadditional effect may be that star formation events may be triggered more easily\nby galaxy encounters in the low velocity dispersion environment of voids 38 .\nInterestingly, voids also contain nearly normal ellipticals 73,19 . It seems that\nthe red sequence of ellipticals in the color-magnitude diagram from SDSS is almost\nindependent of environment 73 , contrasting sharply to the significant blueward shift\nof the blue sequence in voids 7,73 . If major mergers produce ellipticals, it is not\nobvious how galaxies in the least dense regions, where interactions are rare, acquire\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n21\n\nthese properties. Careful examination of ellipticals in voids may therefore reveal\nimportant clues to the balance of nature vs. nurture in galaxy formation.\n5.2. Gas content of void galaxies: the WSRT HI void galaxy\nsurvey\nEven though a crucial factor for understanding their recent formation and star\nformation history, less is known about the gas content of void galaxies. Possible\nsystematic trends in the ratio of hydrogen mass to stellar mass are crucial for\nunderstanding the influence of the void environment on the galaxies' star formation\nhistory. The morphology of the gas layer, in particular that of the outskirts, may\nreflect their isolated existence.\nThe earliest systematic survey of HI in void galaxies is that of the galaxies in the\nBo\u00f6tes region 102 . It comprised pointed observations of 24 IRAS selected galaxies.\nSixteen were detected with sufficient amounts of hydrogen, most of which were\nlate-type, gas-rich and usually disturbed systems. Interesting was the finding of 18\nnew galaxy companions in the vicinity of the known galaxies. Nonetheless, most of\nthe observed galaxies were residing in the outer realms of the void and with some\nreason might have been identified with the moderate density environment of walls.\nAn important additional HI study of void galaxies involved the search for dwarf\ngalaxies in the Local Void 57 . The fact that they were only found at the edge of\n\nFig. 11. The SDSS void galaxy selection procedure. Shown is the location of galaxy void078\nin our sample.

It is one of the most lonely\ngalaxies in the Universe, with no NGC and UGC galaxy within 4 Mpc ! Shown are the\nHI intensity map superimposed on SDSS g band optical image (left), the velocity map\n(centre) and the position-velocity diagram along the major axis. The total HI mass in the\npolar ring is 2.0 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . See Stanonik et al. 2009a.\n\nFig. 12.\n\nthe void and avoid its interior represents a major challenge for our understanding of\ngalaxy formation. Some well-known nearby luminous galaxies whose HI layers have\nbeen studied in detail, ie. NGC6946 and M101, are actually found within the Local\nVoid. It is rather intriguing that e.g. NGC6946 is known to undergo a substantial\nlevel of gas inflow and has a large gas disk bearing the marks of numerous recent\nsupernovae 12 . Galaxies in and around voids are also searched for in the HIPASS\n62 and ALFALFA survey 32 .\nThe most sensitive and systematic study of gaseous void galaxies is our (ongoing)\nWSRT HI survey of SDSS galaxies. It consists of a sample of around 55 galaxies,\nsufficiently large to probe the morphological diversity of void galaxies and voids of\ndifferent size, shape and underdensity.\nIt involves a unique selection procedure in that it is based upon finding void\ngalaxies in the deepest underdensities of the DTFE reconstruction of the density\nfield (DTFE: Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator) in the (DR7) SDSS redshift\nsurvey 94,93,116 . Fig. 11 illustrates the void galaxy selection pipeline. Each sample\ngalaxy is optically selected from SDSS/DR7 and has to be located in the central\ninterior region of a nearby void identified from the SDSS survey. Al sample galaxies\nare at a considerably closer distance than the Bo\u00f6tes void. Most galaxies in our\nsample are blue, a few red (see 10 specimen fig. 10).\nResults of the pilot study are reported in ref. 100 and ref. 101. With 14 detections\nout of of 15 void galaxies, the detection rate of the pilot survey has been 93% 101 .\nThe one without a detection is the reddest galaxy in the sample. The HI content\nof the 14 detected galaxies ranges from \u223c 6.5 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 to \u223c 4.8 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . Their\noptical radii are small, 5-10 kpc, while they have HI disks that extend far beyond\nthe optical and appear to be in regular rotation. Nearly 2/3rd appear asymmetric or\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nCosmic Voids\n\n23\n\nslightly warped at the faintest contour levels. Three galaxies turn out to be uniquely\ninteresting systems. One is part of a system of three galaxies, all aligned in the plane\nof the sky, stretching out over 57 kpc, and connected by an HI bridge possibly related\nto a tenuous void filament. A second galaxy shows regular disk rotation in its HI\ndistribution. However, optically it exhibits a clumpy, knotty morphology similar to\nthat seen in chain-galaxies forming at high redshift. It also has a companion.\nThe most outstanding specimen of the sample is a polar disk galaxy 100 (see\nfig. 12). Amongst the most lonely galaxies in the universe (4 Mpc up to the nearest\nUGC and NGC galaxy), it has a massive, star-poor HI disk that is perpendicular to\nthe disk of the central void galaxy. No optical counterpart to the HI disk has been\nfound, even though the central galaxy is actively forming stars. The ring reveals a\nregular rotation pattern.\nThe galaxy is located within a what looks like a tenuous wall in between two\nlarge roundish voids. The central optical disk is strongly inclined with respect to the\nsurrounding wall (\u223c 60\u25e6 \u2212 70\u25e6 ). The unique void environment forces a reappraisal of\nthe traditionally assumed formation mechanisms for such polar ring galaxies, by a\nclose interaction or merger. Its existence may point to a slow HI accretion dictated\nby the unique environment, possibly at the crossing point of the outflow from the\ntwo voids.\n\n5.3. Missing Void Dwarfs: \u039bCDM challenged ?\nWith respect to their spatial distribution, void galaxies are found to display a significant luminosity dependence. The consensus is that there is a good statistical\nagreement between theory and observation of the large voids defined by L\u2217 galaxies\n51,18,46,108 . The observed density contrast of bright galaxies in large voids, around\n1/10 of the cosmic mean 50,51 , is consistent with theoretical predictions.\nHowever, conflicts arise when we look at the distribution and properties of lower\nluminosity/mass objects. From optical and HI surveys, ref. 57 found that the density\nof faint (\u221218 < MB < \u221212) galaxies is only 1/100 that of the mean. This forms a\nmarked contrast to the prediction by high-resolution \u039bCDM simulations that voids\nhave a density of low mass (109 M\u2299 < M < 1011 M\u2299 ) halos that is 1/10 that of the\ncosmic mean 111,46,107.\nThe dearth of dwarf and/or low surface brightness void galaxies represents a\nmajor challenge for the standard cosmological view of galaxy formation. The simplest models of galaxy formation 67 predict that voids would be filled with galaxies\nof low luminosity, or galaxies of some other uncommon nature 48 . Ref. 78 pointed\nout that the observed salient absence of dwarf galaxies in nearby voids could possibly involve strong ramifications for the viability of the \u039bCDM cosmology on small\nscales. Branded with the name void-phenomenon, the issue has been marked as a\n\"a crisis for the CDM model\" since Peebles strongly emphasized the notion that\nnearby voids do NOT appear to contain the expected population of dwarf and/or\n\n\fSeptember\n17,\nvoids.cospa2008.weygaert\n\n24\n\n2018 16:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nRien van de Weijgaert\n\nlow surface brightness galaxies.\nVarious processes and influences have been forwarded as an explanation for the\nmissing void dwarfs within the context of existing galaxy formation theories. These\ninvolve environmental properties of dark matter halos and astrophysical procesess,\nranging from supplementary baryonic physical processes and radiation feedback\nprocesses.\nThe nature of the environmental influence on the formation of halos has been\naddressed in a variety of studies. High-resolution simulations now clearly predict\ndependence of the shape, concentration, spin, and mean age of formation of halos\non their environment 98,31,112,43,1,41 , particularly so for lower mass halos. Because\nthe mass function of halos shifts to lower masses in voids these effects should be most\nnoticeable among void galaxies 34,33 . Ref. 30 and ref. 108 modelled the dependence\nof the properties of galaxies on the halos they inhibit to infer the properties of voids\nin the galaxy distribution. According to ref. 108, halo models would explain away\nthe void phenomenon. However, the implied spatial segregation between galaxies of\ndifferent luminosities in and near voids does not bear much resemblance to reality.\nThe issue still seems far from solved and progress will depend largely on insights\noffered by new observational data.\nAmongst the most plausible astrophysical explanations for the absence of dwarfs\nin voids is the ionizing influence of the UV background in suppressing the star\nforming capacity of low mass halos 4 . However, ref. 46 showed that these effects\nwould not explain the distribution of dwarf galaxies in voids. Also the suggestion\nthat supernova feedback would be instrumental in evicting gas from the shallow\npotential wells of the dwarfs does not seem to offer an explanation. Simulations by\nref. 103 showed that most internal properties of dwarf galaxies can be reproduced\nwithout invoking supernova feedback.\nAcknowledgments\nOur voyage along the empty realms of our universe has been made possible by the\nmany inspiring and instructive discussions and keen insights of those who shared the\nexperience along minor or major parts of the journey.
