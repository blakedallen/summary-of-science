Even in refined versions of that model the calculated decay width of the \u2206(1232)\nis typically less than half of the empirical value, while those of the N(1440) and the \u2206(1600)\nare even smaller [1, 2]. Explicit coupled channel treatments of the interacting \u03c0 \u2212 N \u2212 \u2206\nsystem [3, 4] show that this problem is likely to arise from coupling to explicit pion degrees\nof freedom, which are missing in the qqq valence quark model. This suggests that the\nquark model be extended to include explicit sea-quark (q q\u0304) configurations. The presence of\nsuch sea-quark configurations in the proton has in fact been experimentally demonstrated\n[5, 6, 7, 8].\nHere such an extension of the valence quark model is made to include those qqqq q\u0304 components in the proton and the \u2206(1232) wave function, which are likely to require the lowest\nexcitation energy, in order to study the effect of these qqqq q\u0304 components on the calculated\nelectromagnetic decay rates of the \u2206(1232). As in a previous study of the effect of qqqq q\u0304\ncomponents on the calculated pion decay rate of the \u2206(1232), it is found that transitions\nbetween the qqqq q\u0304 components in the resonances and in the nucleon themselves leads to\nmodifications of only a few percent [9]. On the other hand the direct quark-antiquark annihilation transitions between the qqqq q\u0304 components in the resonances and the qqq component\nof the proton is significant.\nThe confining and hyperfine interactions between the quarks can also trigger such quarkantiquark annihilation transitions. In the case of pion decay the confining interaction leads\nto an enhancement of the net effect of annihilation transitions on the calculated decay rates.\nHere it is found to have the opposite effect in the case of the electromagnetic decays, unless\nthe interaction potential is attractive at short range . The magnitude of the confinement\ntriggered annihilation transitions is estimated with two schematic models (linear and harmonic) for the confining interaction. Given the opposite effects of the confinement triggered\nannihilation transitions in pion and electromagnetic decay, the conclusion is that this effect\nshould be of minor net significance.\nIt is found that the effect of the direct annihilation transitions on the calculated helicity\namplitudes for gamma decay of \u2206(1232) is to bring them closer to the empirical values. A\n2\n\n\fprobability of \u223c 20% for the qqqq q\u0304 component in the \u2206(1232) leads to a reduction of the\nunderprediction of \u223c 1.7 in the valence quark model to \u223c 1.5. This leads to a corresponding\nreduction of the underprediction of the radiative width by about half.\nThe quark-antiquark annihilation transitions bring the calculated helicity amplitude ratio\nA3/2 /A1/2 into agreement with the empirical ratio. As a consequence they lead to a nonvanishing value for the calculated E2/M1 ratio REM , which falls within the empirical range.\nThe paper is structured in the following way. In section II the effect of transitions between\nthe qqqq q\u0304 components wave functions of proton and \u2206(1232) in qqqq q\u0304 configurations are\ncalculated. In Section III the corresponding annihilation transitions qqqq q\u0304 \u2192 qqq\u03b3 are\nconsidered. Section IV contains a concluding discussion.\n\nII.\n\nTRANSITIONS BETWEEN qqqq q\u0304 COMPONENTS IN \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 DECAY\n\nConsider \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 decay that arises from the direct electromagnetic coupling to constituent quarks: qq\u03b3. To lowest order in the photon momentum the transition amplitude\nobtained from the electromagnetic \u03b3\u03bc coupling for pointlike quarks is then\nTi =\n\nq\nei\n\u03c3i\u2212 k\u03b3 ,\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ei and m are the electric charge and mass of the quark that emits the photon, respectively. The momentum of the final right-handed photon is taken to be in the direction of\nthe z-axis: ~k = (0, 0, k\u03b3 ) with k\u03b3 =259 MeV in the center of mass frame of \u2206(1232).\nThe \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 transition is described by the two independent helicity amplitudes:\nnq\n3 3\n1 1 X\nTi | \u2206+ ,\n|\ni,\nA 3 = hp,\n2\n2 2\n2 2\ni\n\nnq\n1\n3 1\n1 X\nA 1 = hp,\nTi | \u2206+ ,\n\u2212 |\ni.\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\ni\n\n(2)\n\nThese represent the helicity components 3/2 and 1/2 of the \u2206(1232) on the direction of the\nphoton momentum. In eq. (2) nq is the number of constituent quarks.\nThe spatial wave function of the quarks in the spatially symmetric ground state will be\nschematically described by the harmonic oscillator wave function:\n\u03c932 3/4 \u2212\u03bei2 \u03c932 /2\n.\n\u03c60 (\u03bei ) = ( ) e\n\u03c0\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe scale of the oscillator parameter \u03c93 may be set by the empirical radius of the proton as\n\u03c93 = 1/rp \u2243 225 MeV. In (3) \u03be~i , i=1, 2, are the standard Jacobi coordinates of the 3-quark\nsystem. The helicity amplitudes for \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 decay in the conventional qqq configuration\n\nare then:\n(3q)\n\nA3\n2\n\n(3q)\n\nA1\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nk\u03b3 2\n6 e q\nk\u03b3 (1 \u2212 2 ) ,\n3 2m\n6\u03c93\n\u221a\nq\n2 e\nk\u03b3 2\n=\u2212\nk\u03b3 (1 \u2212 2 ).\n3 2m\n6\u03c93\n=\u2212\n\n(4)\n\nHere m is again the constituent quark mass. These expressions yield the usual quark model\n\u221a\n(3q)\n(3q)\nvalue for the ratio of the helicity amplitudes: A 3 /A 1 = 3. If the constituent quark\n2\n2\n\u221a\n(3q)\nmass is taken to be 340 MeV, these expressions lead to the values A 1 = \u22120.083/ GeV and\n2\n\u221a\n(3q)\nA 3 = \u22120.143/ GeV. These values are smaller by factors 1.6 and 1.8, respectively, than\n2\n\u221a\nthe corresponding experimental values A 1 = \u22120.135 \u00b1 0.006/ GeV and A 3 = \u22120.255 \u00b1\n2\n2\n\u221a\n0.008/ GeV [10].\nConsider now qqqq q\u0304 admixtures in the proton and the \u2206+ . Positive parity demands\nthat these have to be P \u2212wave states. The spin dependence of the hyperfine interaction\nbetween the quarks implies that the qqqq q\u0304 configurations that have the lowest energy, and\nwhich are most likely to form notable admixtures in the baryon states, are those that have\nthe most antisymmetric qqqq configurations, which are compatible with the requirement\nof overall antisymmetry. In the case of the nucleon this state has the mixed spin-flavor\nsymmetry [4]F S [22]F [22]S and in the case of the \u2206(1232) the mixed spin-flavor symmetry\n[4]F S [31]F [31]S [11].\nThe qqqq q\u0304 component in the proton, with a qqqq configuration with spin-flavor symmetry\n[4]F S [22]F [22]S has mixed spatial symmetry [31]X , and may be represented by the wave\nfunction:\nAp5 X X\n[1111]\n\u03c8p (MS ) = \u221a\n(1, 1/2, m, s| 1/2, MS ) C[211]a,[31]a\n2 a,b m,s\n\n[211]C (a) [31]X,m (a) [22]F (b) [22]S (b) \u03c7\u0304s \u03c6({ri }) .\n\n(5)\n\nHere MS denotes the spin-z component of the state and Ap5 is the amplitude of the con[1111]\n\nfiguration. The symbol C[211]a,[31]a is a S4 Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The color, space and\nflavor-spin wave functions of the qqqq subsystem have here been denoted by their Young\npatterns respectively. The sum over a runs over the 3 configurations of the [211]C and [31]X\n4\n\n\frepresentations of S4 , and the sum over b runs over the 2 configurations of the [22] representation of S4 respectively [12]. Note that as the isospin of the qqqq of the [22]F configuration\nis 0, the antiquark can only be a d \u0304 quark in this configuration.\nThe corresponding qqqq q\u0304 configuration in the \u2206(1232), with the flavor-spin symmetry\n[4]F S [31]F [31]S in the qqqq configuration may be represented by the wave function:\n(J)\nA X X\n(J)\n[1111]\n\u03c8\u2206+ (MS ) = \u221a\u22065\n(1, 1, m, M| J, j)(J, 1/2, j, s| 3/2, MS ) C[211]a,[31]a\n3 a,b m,s,M,j;T,t\n\n(1, 1/2, T, t|3/2, 1/2)[211]C (a) [31]X,m (a) [31]F,T (b) [31]S,M (b) \u03c7\u0304t,s \u03c6({ri }) .\n\n(6)\n\nHere J denotes the total angular momentum of the qqqq system, which takes the values\n(J)\n\n1 and 2, and A\u22065 is the amplitude of the configuration in the \u2206(1232). The sum over a\nagain runs over the 3 configurations of the [211]C and [31]X representations of S4 . Here\nthe sum over b runs over the 3 configurations of the [31] representation. Here the isospin-z\ncomponent of the 4-quark state is denoted T and that of the antiquark t, which results in\nthe quark combination uuddd\u0304 for T=0, t=1/2 and uuud\u016b for T=1, t=\u22121/2. Since there is\nno isospin flip in the transition operator (1), only the five quark configuration uuddd\u0304 in \u2206+\ncontributes to the direct transition \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3.\nThe orbital wave function of the P-shell qqqq states [31]X in eqs. (5) and (6) are described\nby the product of the S-wave and P-wave harmonic oscillator functions:\n\u03c6\u03030 (\u03bei ) = (\n\n\u03c952 3/4 \u2212\u03bei2 \u03c952 /2\n,\n) e\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c6\u03031m (\u03bei ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c95 \u03bei,m \u03c60 (\u03bei ) .\n\n(7)\n\nHere the oscillator parameter \u03c95 is that for the qqqq q\u0304 system. The operators \u03bei , i=1..3, are\nthe standard Jacobi coordinates for the five-quark system in the spherical basis [11].\nThe calculation of helicity amplitudes for the transition between the qqqq q\u0304 components\nin proton and \u2206 is straightforward and leads to:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 3\ne q\nk\u03b3 2\n(5q)\nk\u03b3 (1 \u2212 2 ) ,\nA3 = \u2212\n(\u03b4J1 + 5\u03b4J2 )\n2\n9\n2m\n5\u03c95\n2\nq\n\u221a\n2\ne\nk\u03b3\n(5q)\nk\u03b3 (1 \u2212 2 ) .\nA 1 = \u2212 (\u03b4J1 + 5\u03b4J2 )\n2\n9\n2m\n5\u03c95\n\n(8)\n\nFrom eqs. (4) and (8) one obtains the ratio between the helicity amplitudes for direct\ntransition when the qqqq q\u0304 configurations in proton and \u2206+ (1232) are included to be:\nA3\n\n2\n\nA1\n2\n\n(J)\n\n=\n\n5q\nAp3 A\u22063 A3q\n3 + Ap5 A\u22065 A 3\n2\n\n2\n\n(J)\n\n5q\nAp3 A\u22063 A3q\n1 + Ap5 A\u22065 A 1\n2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n=\n\n\u221a\n\n3,\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhich is the standard quark model result. Here Ap3 , Ap5 are the amplitudes for the qqq\n(J)\n\nand qqqq q\u0304 components of the proton and the \u2206(1232) respectively, and A\u22063 , A\u22065 are the\namplitudes for the corresponding components of the \u2206(1232).\nThe magnetic dipole M1 and electric quadrupole E2 moment contributions to \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3\ndecay are related to the helicity amplitudes as [10]\n\u221a\n1\nM1 = \u2212 \u221a (3A 3 + 3A 1 ) ,\n2\n2\n2 3\n\u221a\n1\nE2 = \u221a (A 3 \u2212 3A 1 ).\n2\n2\n2 3\n\n(10)\n\nSince the contribution from the direct transitions between qqqq q\u0304 components of the\n\u221a\n\u2206(1232) and the nucleon leaves the calculated ratio A 3 /A 1 unchanged from the value 3\n2\n\n2\n\ngiven by the qqq configuration with spatially symmetric wave functions(9), they leave the\nE2 amplitude unchanged at 0.\nWhile direct transitions between the qqqq q\u0304 components in proton and \u2206 do not change\nthe calculated value for the E2 /M1 ratio for \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 decay, they do affect the calculated\ndecay width. In terms of the helicity amplitudes, the decay width is given by [10],\nk\u03b32\n2Mp\n[|A 3 |2 + |A 1 |2 ],\n\u0393=\n2\n2\n\u03c0 (2J + 1)M\u2206\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Mp and M\u2206 are the masses of proton and the \u2206, respectively, and J = 3/2 is the\nspin of \u2206. By taking into account the normalization of the wave functions of proton and\n\u2206(1232) in both the qqq and qqqq q\u0304 configurations, the enhancement of the calculated decay\nwidth that arises from the direct transitions between the qqqq q\u0304 components is:\n\n\u03b4=\n\n\u0393\n=\n\u03933q\n\nX\n\n\u03bb=1/2,3/2\n\n(3q)\n\n|Ap3 A\u22063 A\u03bb\n\n(J)\n\n(5q)\n\n+ Ap5 A\u22065 A\u03bb |2\n\n(3q)\n\n(5q)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n|A 3 |2 + |A 1 |2\n\n.\n\nWith the present wave function model, (4), (8), this leads to the expression:\n\u221a\n\u221a (2)\n2\n(1)\n\u03b4 = |Ap3 A\u22063 +\nAp5 (A\u22065 + 5A\u22065 )|2 ,\n3\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nif the radii of the 3- and the 5-quark components are taken to be equal, so that\n\u03c95 =\n\ns\n\n6\n\u03c93 .\n5\n\n(14)\n\nIt is worth noting that the condition (14) is not necessary for the eq. (9). The numerical\neffect of the 5 quark components is small even when the probability of the qqqq q\u0304 components\n6\n\n\fof the proton and the \u2206(1232) are larger than 10%. With 10% probability for the qqqq q\u0304\ncomponent in the nucleon and \u2206(1232), in which the proportion of the J = 1 and J = 2\nqqqq states in \u2206(1232) are assumed to be 50% and 50%, respectively, the effect of the\nqqqq q\u0304 component is to enhance the calculated values of both helicity amplitudes by a factor\n\u221a\n\u03b4 \u223c 1.01, and the decay width by a factor \u03b4 \u223c 1.02. With the enhancement factor 1.01 the\nhelicity amplitude A 1 is smaller than the empirical value by a factor 1.6, and the calculated\n2\n\nvalue of A 3 smaller by a factor 1.7 than the corresponding empirical value. Hence the net\n2\n\neffect of the transition between the qqqq q\u0304 component in the \u2206(1232) and proton is to increase\nthe decay width by only a few percent at most.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nq q\u0304 ANNIHILATION TRANSITIONS IN \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 DECAY\nDirect annihilation transitions\n\nThe Dirac (\u03b3\u03bc ) coupling for pointlike quarks used in previous section leads to following\nthe q q\u0304 \u2192 \u03b3 transition operator for the transition \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 illustrated in in Fig. 1:\nTa =\n\n4\nX\n\n1\nei \u03c3i\u2212 q ,\nk\u03b3\ni=1\n\n(15)\n\nwhere ei is the electric charge of the quark that annihilates the anti-quark and \u03c3i\u2212 is the\nspin lowering operator. The \u03c3i\u2212 in eq. (15) requires the annihilating quark to have the spinz component 1/2, which, in combination with the anti-quark with spin-z component 1/2,\nproduces the final photon with angular moment L = 1, Lz = 1. Note there is no contribution\nfrom transitions of the reverse type qqq \u2192 qqqq q\u0304.\nThe helicity amplitudes for the qqqq q\u0304 \u2192 qqq+\u03b3 transition are obtained as matrix elements\nof the operator (15) between the proton in qqq configuration and \u2206 in qqqq q\u0304 configuration\n(6). Note that both of the quark combinations uuddd\u0304 and uuud\u016b in the \u2206+ contribute to\nthe qqqq q\u0304 \u2192 qqq + \u03b3 transition through dd \u0304 \u2192 \u03b3 and u\u016b \u2192 \u03b3, respectively.

It may be seen from eq. (16) that the P \u2212shell\nqqqq configuration in \u2206 does not contribute to the decay amplitudes with helicity 1/2.\nThe matrix element in orbital space may be approximately evaluated with a power series\nexpansion in k\u03b3 , with the result [9]:\n\n\u221a\n\u03c93 \u03c95 3 k\u03b3 2\n3 k\u03b32\nhT i \u2243 ( 2 )\n(1 \u2212\n).\n\u03c9\n\u03c95 4\n20 \u03c952\n\nHere the normalization factor (\u03c93 \u03c95 /\u03c9 2 )3 , with \u03c9 =\n\n(17)\n\nq\n\n(\u03c932 + \u03c952 )/2, comes from the different\n\nvalues of the size parameters \u03c93 in eq. (3) and \u03c95 in eq. (7).\nThe helicity amplitudes for the direct annihilation process are obtained by taking the\nproduct of the matrix elements in SFC space (16) and orbital space (17) as\nq\n\u221a\nk\u03b3\ne\n\u221a (1)\n3 k\u03b32\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n10\n3 5\n(2)\nAp3 ( 5A\u22065 + A\u22065 )( 2 )3\n(1 \u2212\n)\nAa 3 = \u2212\n2\n45\n\u03c9\n\u03c95\n20 \u03c952\nq\n\u221a\ne\nk\u03b3\n3 k\u03b32\n2 30\n(2) \u03c93 \u03c95 3\n1\n(1 \u2212\nAp3 A\u22065 ( 2 )\n).\nAa = \u2212\n2\n135\n\u03c9\n\u03c95\n20 \u03c952\n8\n\n(18)\n\n\f\u221a\n\nAs the ratio of these amplitudes differs from\n\n3 they lead to a non-vanishing value for the\n\nE2/M1 ratio.\nAssuming again that the probability of the qqqq q\u0304 configuration in both the proton and\nthe \u2206(1232) is 10%, in which the J = 1 and J = 2 qqqq states of the \u2206(1232) are assumed\nto have the proportion of 50% and 50%, respectively, the direct annihilation transition leads\nto an enhancement of the calculated value for the helicity amplitudes A 1 and A 3 factors\n2\n\n2\n\n1.01 and 1.08 respectively. When these enhancement factors are combined with those that\narise from transitions between the qqqq q\u0304 components, the combined enhancement factor for\nthe calculated value of the helicity amplitude A 1 is 1.12 and that for the amplitude A 3 is\n2\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1.18. When the standard qqq quark model values, -0.083/ GeV and -0.143/ GeV, for these\ntwo amplitudes are multiplied by the corresponding enhancement factors, the net calculated\n\u221a\n\u221a\nvalues for the two amplitudes become A 1 = \u22120.093/ GeV and A 3 = \u22120.171/ GeV,\n2\n\n2\n\nrespectively. The first of these two values is smaller by a factor 1.4 than the corresponding\nempirical value, and the second is smaller by a factor 1.5 than the empirical value. The\ncalculated ratio of the two helicity amplitudes, A 3 /A 1 = 1.84 is however considerably closer\n2\n2\n\u221a\nto the empirical value 1.89 than the value 3 \u2243 1.73 that is obtained in the qqq and qqqq q\u0304\nquark model. Assuming a 10% probability of the qqqq q\u0304 component in the proton and 20%\nin the \u2206(1232), with equal proportion of the J = 1 and J = 2 qqqq states in \u2206(1232), the\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncalculated helicity amplitudes increase to A 1 = \u22120.096/ GeV and A 3 = \u22120.180/ GeV.\n2\n\n2\n\nThese values lead to the ratio A 3 /A 1 = 1.88, which very close to the empirical value, and\n2\n\n2\n\nto an enhancement of the calculated decay width by 1.5.\n\nB.\n\nAnnihilation with quark-quark confinement interactions\n\nQuark-antiquark annihilation transitions can be triggered by the interactions between\nthe quarks in the baryons. The most obvious such triggering interaction is the confining\ninteraction. Recently it has been noted that the confining interaction may contribute significantly to the calculated pion decay width of the \u2206 [9]. A similar effect naturally also\nshould be expected in the case of the transition \u2206+ \u2192 p\u03b3 (Fig. 2). To lowest order in the\nquark momenta the amplitude for this confinement triggered annihilation mechanism may,\nin the case of a linear confining interaction, be derived by making the following replacement\n\n9\n\n\fP\n\n\u03b3\nk\u03b3\n\n\u2206\n\nq\n\nq\n\nFIG. 2: Confinement induced qqqq q\u0304 \u2192 qqq\u03b3 annihilation process\n\nin the transition operator for direct annihilation (15):\nei \u03c3i\u2212 \u2192 ei \u03c3i\u2212 (1 \u2212\n\ncrij \u2212 b\n).\n2m\n\n(19)\n\nHere c is the string tension, rij is the distance between the two quarks that interact by the\nconfining interaction and b is a constant, which shifts the zero point of the confinement.\nThis replacement applies both in the case of scalar and vector coupled confinement. If the\nconfining interaction is assumed to have the color coupling ~\u03bbC * ~\u03bbC , the string tension c\ni\n\nj\n\nshould be the same for all the qq and q q\u0304 pairs in the qqqq q\u0304 system, and half of the value for\nquark pairs in three-quark systems [16]. Here we use the value c = 280 MeV/fm [9].\nFrom this expression it follows that for b > 0, which implies that the effective confining\npotential is negative at short range, and which is suggested by phenomenological study of\nthe D and Ds meson spectra [13], the confining interaction reduces the net annihilation\namplitude. This situation is similar to that in electromagnetic decay of heavy quarkonia\nand heavy light mesons [14, 15].\nThe orbital matrix element of the annihilation process with the linear interaction \u2212(cr \u2212\n10\n\n\fb)/2m between quarks is given by [9]\n\u221a\n\u03c93 \u03c95 3 c k\u03b3 128 15\nhTconf i = \u2212( 2 )\n( )\nK(k\u03b3 ) .\n\u03c9\nm\u03c9 \u03c95 375\u03c0\n\n(20)\n\nHere the function K(q) is defined as\nK(q) =\n\n\u03c955\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd\u03be \u03be 4\n\nj1 (\u03b2q\u03be) \u2212\u03b12 \u03be2\ne\nk(\u03c9\u03be) .\n\u03b2q\u03be\n\n(21)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 in this expression are defined as \u03b1 = 2\u03c95 / 5 and \u03b2 = 2 3/5,\nrespectively.

(23) to that in eq. (4), (8), (18),\nthe confinement triggered annihilation reaction reduces the calculated values of the helicity\namplitudes, and increases the disagreement with the empirical values. The quantitative\nimportance of this effect does of course depend on the value of the constant b. If this is\ntaken to be \u223c 480 MeV, the matrix element of the amplitude of the confinement triggered\nannihilation transition vanishes. The contribution of the annihilation transition triggered by\nlinear confinement to the \u2206(1232) \u2192 p\u03b3 decay is therefore insignificant when the constant\nin the linear confining interaction is taken to be in the range by 350 \u2212 500 MeV (Table I).\nThis range is only slightly larger than the values employed in the literature on heavy flavor\nspectroscopy [15].\nTo have an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the magnitude of the contribution\nof the confinement triggered annihilation process, we also consider the case of harmonic\n11\n\n\fTABLE I: Calculated helicity amplitudes, the ratio between the helicity amplitudes and the enhancement of calculated electromagnetic decay width from the qqq quark model value (\u03b4) for\ndifferent values of the constant b in the linear confining potential.

As in addition the increase of the calculated A 3 helicity amplitude is larger\n2\n\nthan that of the A 1 amplitude, the calculated ratio A 3 /A 1 may be brought into agreement\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nwith the empirical values by introduction of such qqqq q\u0304 admixtures into the quark model\nwave functions for the nucleon and the \u2206(1232) resonance.\nThese results are consistent with the conclusion based on studies of the coupled channel\nN \u2212 \u2206 \u2212 \u03c0 system, that the effect of the \"pion cloud\" around the baryons is significant, and\nresponsible for \u223c 30% of the N \u2212 \u2206 transition magnetic moment.\n13\n\n\fThe change of the calculated ratio of the helicity amplitudes A 3 /A 1 from the quark model\n2\n2\n\u221a\nvalue 3 to 1.88 is consistent with the magnitude expected on the basis of the large NC\nlimit of QCD [17]:\nA 3 /A 1 =\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n\n3 + O(1/Nc2) .\n\n(28)\n\nEquivalently, the ratio E2 /M1 of the multipole amplitudes is predicted to be order 1/Nc2 .\nIntroduction of 10 \u2212 20% admixtures of qqqq q\u0304 components in the wave functions of the\nnucleon and the \u2206(1232) resonance was however not found to be sufficient to completely\nremove the underprediction of the empirical values of the helicity amplitudes A 1 and A 3 in\n2\n\n2\n\nthe quark model. Additional annihilation mechanisms that are triggered by the interaction\nbetween the quarks may be required for this purpose. As an example of such a mechanism\nthe annihilation mechanism that is triggered by the confining interaction was considered\nhere. In the case of linear confinement it was however found that this mechanism only leads\nto an additional enhancement if the linear interaction potential is large an negative at short\nrange, which may not be phenomenologically realistic.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nResearch supported in part by the Academy of Finland grant number 54038\n\n[1] B.
