Thus these types of transformations are completely determined by their\nlocal actions on the two-points subsets of the groups in question.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe study of automorphism groups of algebraic structures is of great importance in every\nfield of mathematics. In a series of papers (see [1, 6, 4] and the references therein) we\ninvestigated these groups from the point of view of how they are determined by their\nlocal actions. Our investigations were motivated by the paper [2] of Kadison on local\nderivations and by a problem of Larson in [3] initiating the study of local automorphisms\nof Banach algebras. The structures that we treated so far were mainly C \u2217 -algebras and we\nconsidered the following question: When is it true that any local automorphism, that is,\nany linear transformation which pointwise equals an automorphism (this automorphism\nmay, of course, differ from point to point) is an automorphism?\nIt is easy to see that if we drop the assumption of the linearity of the transformations\nin question, then the corresponding statements are no longer true. However, if instead of\nlinearity plus locality we assume the so-called 2-locality, then we can obtain positive results\n(for the first such result see [12]). 2-locality means that our transformation (linearity is not\nassumed any more) is supposed to be equal to an automorphism at every pair of points.\nNotice that in this way we arrive at a question that can be raised in any algebraic structure.\nFor example, this observation motivated us to consider the problem for the orthomodular\n\n2\n\n\fposet of all projections on a Hilbert space whose structure plays a fundamental role in\nthe mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics (see [5]).\nIn the present paper we study the analogous problem in the case of two important\ngroups appearing in pure algebra and in the theory of operator algebras. They are the\nunitary group and the general linear group.\nWe begin with some notation and definitions. Throughout the paper H denotes a\ncomplex infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space. By B(H), U(H), GL(H), and A(H)\nwe denote the algebra of all bounded linear operators on H, the multiplicative group of all\nunitary operators on H, the general linear group on H consisting of all bounded invertible\nlinear operators on H, and the set of all additive maps on H (that is, the set of all maps\nA : H \u2192 H satisfying A(x + y) = Ax + Ay (x, y \u2208 H)), respectively. For T \u2208 B(H) we\ndenote its spectrum by \u03c3(T ).\nA mapping \u03c6 : GL(H) \u2192 GL(H) is called a 2-local automorphism of the general linear\ngroup if for every X, Y \u2208 GL(H) there is an automorphism \u03c6X,Y of the group GL(H),\ndepending on X and Y , such that \u03c6X,Y (X) = \u03c6(X) and \u03c6X,Y (Y ) = \u03c6(Y ). In the case\nof the unitary group the situation is somewhat different. Because of certain reasons (see,\nfor example, Theorem 2.1), U(H) is considered here as a topological group and by an\nautomorphism of U(H) we mean a uniformly continuous group-automorphism. Now, not\nsurprisingly, a mapping \u03c6 : U(H) \u2192 U(H) is called a 2-local automorphism of the unitary\ngroup if for every X, Y \u2208 U(H) there is an automorphism \u03c6X,Y of U(H) (in the above\nsense), such that \u03c6X,Y (X) = \u03c6(X) and \u03c6X,Y (Y ) = \u03c6(Y ).\n\n2\n\nLocal automorphisms of the unitary group\n\nIt was proved in [10] that any uniformly continuous group isomorphism between the\nunitary groups of two AW \u2217 -factors is implemented by a linear or conjugate-linear *isomorphism of the factors themselves. As a particular case, concerning B(H) we have\nthe following result.\nTheorem 2.1 (Sakai) Let \u03c6 : U(H) \u2192 U(H) be a uniformly continuous automorphism.\nThen there exists either a unitary or an antiunitary operator U on H such that\n\u03c6(V ) = UV U \u2217\n\n(V \u2208 U(H)).\n\n(1)\n\nAs for the 2-local automorphisms of the unitary group U(H) we have the following\nstatement. In the proof we use the notation x \u2297 y which denotes the operator on H\ndefined by\n(x \u2297 y)(z) = hz, yix\n(z \u2208 H)\nfor any x, y \u2208 H.\nTheorem 2.2 Every 2-local automorphism of U(H) is an automorphism.\n3\n\n\fProof. Let \u03c6 : U(H) \u2192 U(H) be a 2-local automorphism. For every projection\nP \u2208 B(H), the operator I \u2212 2P is unitary. Since \u03c6 is locally of the form (1), we obtain\nthat \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ) = I \u2212 2P \u2032 for some projection P \u2032 . Consider the transformation\nP 7\u2212\u2192 (I \u2212 \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ))/2.\nThis is a 2-local automorphism of the orthomodular poset of all projections on H. By\n[5, Proposition], it is an automorphism and there is either a unitary or an antiunitary\noperator U on H such that our transformation is of the form\nP 7\u2212\u2192 (I \u2212 \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ))/2 = UP U \u2217 .\nWe have \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ) = U(I \u2212 2P )U \u2217 for every projection P . Transforming the original map\n\u03c6 by this operator U, we can suppose without loss of generality that \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ) = I \u2212 2P\nfor every projection P . Let V \u2208 U(H) and pick an arbitrary unit vector x \u2208 H. Let P\nbe the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by x, that is, let P = x \u2297 x. By\nthe local property of \u03c6 we have an either unitary or antiunitary operator UV,P such that\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c6(V ) = UV,P V UV,P\nand \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ) = UV,P (I \u2212 2P )UV,P\n. Since \u03c6(I \u2212 2P ) = I \u2212 2P , it\n\u2217\nfollows that P = UV,P P UV,P . We compute\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nh\u03c6(V )x, xix \u2297 x = x \u2297 x * \u03c6(V ) * x \u2297 x = UV,P P UV,P\nUV,P V UV,P\nUV,P P UV,P\n=\n\u2217\n\u2217\nUV,P P V P UV,P\n= UV,P * hV x, xix \u2297 x * UV,P\n.\n\nSince UV,P is either linear or conjugate-linear, we have either\nh\u03c6(V )x, xix \u2297 x = hV x, xiUV,P x \u2297 UV,P x\nor\nh\u03c6(V )x, xix \u2297 x = hV x, xiUV,P x \u2297 UV,P x.\nWe deduce that for every x \u2208 H either\nh\u03c6(V )x, xi = hV x, xi\nor\nh\u03c6(V )x, xi = hV x, xi\nholds true. It is rather elementary to verify (see [5, Lemma]) that this implies that\neither \u03c6(V ) = V or \u03c6(V ) = V \u2217 . We show that either \u03c6(V ) = V for every V \u2208 U(H)\nor \u03c6(V ) = V \u2217 for every V \u2208 U(H). To see this, observe that \u03c6(iI) is either iI or\n\u2212iI. First assume that \u03c6(iI) = iI. We assert that in this case we have \u03c6(V ) = V\n(V \u2208 U(H)). Suppose on the contrary that there is a non-selfadjoint unitary operator V\nfor which \u03c6(V ) = V \u2217 . Let \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(V ). By the spectral theorem of normal operators we can\nchoose a sequence (xn ) of pairwise orthogonal unit vectors in H such that hV xn , xn i \u2192 \u03bb.\nWe extend (xn ) to a complete orthonormal sequence (x\u2032n ) in H. Pick pairwise different\n4\n\n\fcomplex numbers \u03bbn of modulus 1 from the open upper half-plane and consider the unitary\nP\noperator W = n \u03bbn x\u2032n \u2297 x\u2032n . By the local property of \u03c6 we have an either unitary\n\u2217\n\u2217\nor antiunitary operator Ui,W such that \u03c6(iI) = Ui,W iIUi,W\nand \u03c6(W ) = Ui,W W Ui,W\n.\nSince we have supposed that \u03c6(iI) = iI, it follows that Ui,W is unitary. So, \u03c6(W ) =\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\nn \u03bbn Ui,W xn \u2297 Ui,W xn and, on the other hand, we know that \u03c6(W ) = W or \u03c6(W ) = W .\nThese result in \u03c6(W ) = W . Once again, by the local property of \u03c6 we have an either\nunitary or antiunitary operator UW,V such that\n\u2217\n\u03c6(W ) = UW,V W UW,V\n\n\u2217\nand \u03c6(V ) = UW,V V UW,V\n.\n\nSince \u03c6(W ) = W , it follows that UW,V is necessarily linear and from the equalities\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u03bbn x\u2032n \u2297 x\u2032n = W = \u03c6(W ) = UW,V W UW,V\n=\n\nn\n\nX\n\n\u03bbn UW,V x\u2032n \u2297 UW,V x\u2032n\n\nn\n\nwe conclude that UW,V is diagonizable with respect to (x\u2032n ). Therefore, we can compute\nhxn , V xn i = hV \u2217 xn , xn i = h\u03c6(V )xn , xn i =\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhUW,V V UW,V\nxn , xn i = hV UW,V\nxn , UW,V\nxn i = hV xn , xn i.\n\nIf n goes to infinity, we obtain that \u03bb = \u03bb. Since \u03bb was an arbitrary element of \u03c3(V ), we\ninfer that V = V \u2217 which is a contradiction. So, we have \u03c6(V ) = V for every V \u2208 U(H)\nand this shows that \u03c6 is an automorphism of U(H). We now consider the case when\n\u03c6(iI) = \u2212iI. Similarly as above one can verify that then we have \u03c6(V ) = V \u2217 (V \u2208 U(H)).\nBy the local property of \u03c6 it follows that for every V, V \u2032 \u2208 U(H) there exists an either\nunitary or antiunitary operator U such that V \u2217 = UV U \u2217 and V \u2032 \u2217 = UV \u2032 U \u2217 . If V is\ndiagonal with respect to an orthonormal basis defined in the same way as W and V \u2032\npermutes the same basis, then one can easily arrive at a contradiction.\nThe proof of the theorem is now complete.\n\n3\n\nLocal automorphisms of the general linear\ngroup\n\nWe first remark that we were unable to find the description of the general form of automorphisms of GL(H) in the literature. However, applying a result of Radjavi [7] on\na factorization of invertible operators into a product of involutions and some automatic\ncontinuity techniques it is possible to obtain the general form of the automorphisms of\nGL(H) as a consequence of results of Rickart on the isomorphisms of some analogues of the\nclassical groups [8, 9]. So, we begin with a statement on the form of the automorphisms\nof the general linear group GL(H).\nTheorem 3.1 Let \u03c6 : GL(H) \u2192 GL(H) be an automorphism of the general linear group.\nThen \u03c6 is of one of the following forms:\n5\n\n\f(i) there exists a bounded linear invertible operator T : H \u2192 H such that\n\u03c6(X) = T XT \u22121\n\n(X \u2208 GL(H)),\n\n(ii) there exists a bounded conjugate-linear invertible operator T : H \u2192 H such that\n\u03c6(X) = T XT \u22121\n\n(X \u2208 GL(H)),\n\n(iii) there exists a bounded linear invertible operator T : H \u2192 H such that\n\u0010\n\n\u03c6(X) = T X \u22121 T \u22121\n\n\u0011\u2217\n\n(X \u2208 GL(H)),\n\n(iv) there exists a bounded conjugate-linear invertible operator T : H \u2192 H such that\n\u0010\n\n\u03c6(X) = T X \u22121 T \u22121\n\n\u0011\u2217\n\n(X \u2208 GL(H)).\n\nRemark. If \u03c6 is of type (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), then for every X \u2208 GL(H) we have\n\u03c3(\u03c6(X)) = \u03c3(X), \u03c3(\u03c6(X)) = \u03c3(X), \u03c3(\u03c6(X)) = (\u03c3(X))\u22121 , \u03c3(\u03c6(X)) = \u03c3(X)\u22121 , respectively.\nProof. Let \u03c6 : GL(H) \u2192 GL(H) be an automorphism. By a result of Rickart [8,\nTheorem 5.1], [9, Theorem I], \u03c6 must be either of the form \u03c6(X) = \u03c4 (X)T XT \u22121 or of\nthe form \u03c6(X) = \u03c4 (X)(T X \u22121 T \u22121 )\u2217 , where \u03c4 : GL(H) \u2192 C is a multiplicative map and\nT : H \u2192 H is a bijective additive map satisfying T (\u03bbx) = f (\u03bb)T x, \u03bb \u2208 C, x \u2208 H, for\nsome ring automorphism f of C (one has to be careful when applying the result of Rickart\nsince S \u2217 in his papers denotes the adjoint of an operator S defined as for Banach space\noperators, while here, of course, S \u2217 denotes the adjoint in the Hilbert space sense). Let\nus first show that \u03c4 (X) \u2261 1. Since \u03c4 (I) = 1 we have \u03c4 (S) \u2208 {\u22121, 1} for any involution\nS \u2208 GL(H), that is, for any S satisfying S 2 = I. According to [7] every element of GL(H)\ncan be written as a product of involutions, and consequently, the range of \u03c4 is contained\nin {\u22121, 1}. An arbitrary involution S can be expressed as S = (I \u2212 P ) \u2212 P where P is an\nidempotent. For R = (I \u2212 P ) + iP we have S = R2 , and therefore, \u03c4 (S) = 1. Applying\n[7] once again we conclude that \u03c4 is identically equal to 1.\nTherefore, either \u03c6(X) = T XT \u22121 or \u03c6(X) = (T X \u22121T \u22121 )\u2217 . In the second case we\ncan compose \u03c6 by X 7\u2192 (X \u2217 )\u22121 to conclude that in both cases X 7\u2192 T XT \u22121 is an\nautomorphism of GL(H). We have to prove that f : C \u2192 C is either the identity or\nthe complex conjugation and that T is bounded. To prove this one can apply automatic\ncontinuity techniques (note that for this part of the proof the assumption that H is\ninfinite-dimensional is indispensable). However, we shall use a shorter way of reducing\nthe problem to a known result.\nSo, assume that \u03c6(X) = T XT \u22121 is an automorphism of GL(H). Clearly, \u03c6\u22121 (X) =\n\u22121\nT XT . Define additive mappings \u03c8, \u03c6 : B(H) \u2192 A(H) by \u03c8(X) = T XT \u22121 and\n6\n\n\f\u03c6(X) = T \u22121 XT , X \u2208 B(H). If |\u03bb| > ||X||, then \u03c8(X) = \u03c8(X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03c8(\u03bbI) \u2208\nGL(H) + GL(H) \u2282 B(H). So, \u03c8 is a multiplicative map from B(H) into B(H) which\nis also bijective since \u03c6 : B(H) \u2192 B(H) is its inverse. By [11] there exists a bijective\nbounded linear or conjugate-linear map S : H \u2192 H such that T XT \u22121 = SXS \u22121 for every\nX \u2208 B(H), or equivalently, the additive map S \u22121 T commutes with every X \u2208 B(H). It\nfollows that T = \u03bbS for some nonzero scalar \u03bb. This completes the proof of the statement\nthat every automorphism \u03c6 of GL(H) has one of the forms (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).\nIn the proof of the main result of this section we shall need the following lemma.\nLet K be a nonempty subset of the complex plane and let \u03bb be a complex number. We\nuse the following notation: K \u2212 \u03bb = {\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb : \u03bc \u2208 K}, K = {\u03bc : \u03bc \u2208 K}, and\nr(K) = sup{|\u03bc| : \u03bc \u2208 K} \u2208 [0, \u221e]. If also 0 6\u2208 K, then K \u22121 = {\u03bc\u22121 : \u03bc \u2208 K}.\nLemma. Let K be a nonempty compact subset of C and \u03bb a complex number such\nthat Im \u03bb > r(K) + 1. Then 0 6\u2208 K \u2212 \u03bb, K \u2212 \u03bb =\n6 (K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 , K \u2212 \u03bb 6= K \u2212 \u03bb, and\nK \u2212 \u03bb 6= (K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 .\nProof. Clearly, 0 6\u2208 K\u2212\u03bb and |\u03bb| > r(K)+1. It follows that r(K\u2212\u03bb) \u2265 |\u03bb|\u2212r(K) > 1.\n1\nfor some \u03bb0 \u2208 K. Since\nOn the other hand, r((K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 ) = |\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\n0|\n1\n1\n1\n\u2264\n\u2264\n< 1,\n|\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 |\n|\u03bb| \u2212 |\u03bb0 |\n|\u03bb| \u2212 r(K)\nwe have r(K \u2212 \u03bb) > r((K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 ) = r((K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 ), which further yields that K \u2212 \u03bb 6=\n(K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 and K \u2212 \u03bb 6= (K \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 . Furthermore, our assumption implies that K \u2212 \u03bb\nbelongs to the open lower half-plane, and consequently, K \u2212 \u03bb 6= K \u2212 \u03bb. This completes\nthe proof.\nTheorem 3.2 Every 2-local automorphism of GL(H) is an automorphism.\nProof. Assume that \u03c6 is a 2-local automorphism of GL(H). Composing it with\nan appropriate automorphism of GL(H) we can assume with no loss of generality that\n\u03c6(2iI) = 2iI. It follows from the Remark that \u03c6X,2iI has to be of type (i) for every\nX \u2208 GL(H). In particular, we have \u03c3(\u03c6(X)) = \u03c3(X) (X \u2208 GL(H)), and \u03c6(\u03bbI) = \u03bbI\n(\u03bb \u2208 C). Denote by S the set of all operators X \u2208 GL(H) satisfying \u03c3(X) 6= \u03c3(X) and\n\u03c3(X) 6= \u03c3(X)\u22121 , \u03c3(X) 6= (\u03c3(X))\u22121 . If X \u2208 S and Y is an arbitrary element of GL(H)\nthen \u03c6X,Y has to be of type (i). In particular, \u03c6X,Y (\u03bbI) = \u03bbI (\u03bb \u2208 C).\nNow, let X \u2208 B(H) be any bounded linear operator on H. Denote by LX the set of all\ncomplex numbers \u03bb such that X \u2212\u03bbI is an invertible operator contained in S. By Lemma,\nthis set is always nonempty. We define \u03c8 : B(H) \u2192 B(H) by \u03c8(X) = \u03c6(X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 LX . First we have to show that \u03c8 is well-defined. So, assume that \u03bc also\nbelongs to LX . Then we already know that \u03c6X\u2212\u03bbI,X\u2212\u03bcI is of type (i), and consequently,\n\u03c6(X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI = \u03c6X\u2212\u03bbI,X\u2212\u03bcI (X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI =\n7\n\n\f\u03c6X\u2212\u03bbI,X\u2212\u03bcI (X) = \u03c6(X \u2212 \u03bcI) + \u03bcI.\nNext, we show that the restriction of \u03c8 to GL(H) coincides with \u03c6. In order to do this\nwe first observe that if \u03c6 : GL(H) \u2192 GL(H) is an automorphism of type (i) and if X, Y\nare arbitrary elements of GL(H) such that X + Y is also invertible, then \u03c6(X + Y ) =\n\u03c6(X) + \u03c6(Y ). So, for any X \u2208 GL(H) and \u03bb \u2208 LX \\ {0} we have\n\u03c8(X) = \u03c6(X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI = \u03c6X,X\u2212\u03bbI (X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI =\n\u03c6X,X\u2212\u03bbI (X) + \u03c6X,X\u2212\u03bbI (\u2212\u03bbI) + \u03bbI = \u03c6X,X\u2212\u03bbI (X) = \u03c6(X).\nIt is well-known that every algebra automorphism of B(H) is inner. We show that \u03c8 is a\n2-local automorphism of B(H), that is, for every pair X, Y \u2208 B(H) there exists a bounded\nlinear invertible S : H \u2192 H such that \u03c8(X) = SXS \u22121 and \u03c8(Y ) = SY S \u22121 . By Lemma\nwe know that there exists \u03bb \u2208 C such that \u03bb \u2208 LX \u2229 LY . The automorphism \u03c6X\u2212\u03bbI,Y \u2212\u03bbI\nis of type (i), and therefore spatially implemented by a bounded linear invertible operator,\nsay S. Then\n\u03c8(X) = \u03c6(X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI = \u03c6X\u2212\u03bbI,Y \u2212\u03bbI (X \u2212 \u03bbI) + \u03bbI =\nS(X \u2212 \u03bbI)S \u22121 + \u03bbI = SXS \u22121 ,\nand similarly,\n\u03c8(Y ) = SY S \u22121 .\nApplying the result of the second author [12] on 2-local automorphisms of B(H)\nwe conclude that there exists a bounded linear invertible operator T : H \u2192 H such\nthat \u03c8(X) = T XT \u22121 for every X \u2208 B(H). Consequently, \u03c6(X) = T XT \u22121 for every\nX \u2208 GL(H). This completes the proof.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe express our gratitude to Professor R.V.
