The first and simplest theoretical model of the accretion disks was constructed by imposing strong\nsimplifications on the dynamics and geometrical properties of the disk [1, 2]. In this so-called steady-state thin\naccretion disk model a geometrically thin but optically thick disk was considered in a hydrodynamic approximation\nby neglecting any magnetic fields in the environment of the black hole and the disk. In their early analysis, Novikov\nand Thorne [2] modeled accreting matter as a rotating fluid. This hydrodynamic approximation also holds in the\npresence of a magnetic field as long as the deviation from geodesics of the photon trajectories is less than the Larmor\nradius (which in turn is small compared to the Schwarzschild radius). However, the discovery of the Blandford-Znajek\nmechanism - describing how rotational energy can be extracted from a black hole via magnetic field lines emanating\nfrom its event horizon - indicated that magnetic fields can have a considerable effect both on the evolution of the\nKerr black holes and on the accretion processes feeding the black hole with mass energy [3]. Later on magnetosphere\nmodels were introduced for both static and rotating black holes, which allowed the study of the both the effects of\nthe flux lines connecting the black hole to the accretion disks [4, 5], and magnetohydrodynamic flows in geometrically\nthick disks [6, 7]. Accretion disk instabilities were also recently discussed in Ref. [8]. The black hole spin evolution due\nto accretion, in connection with radiation efficiency, when both jets and magnetic fields are present was investigated\nin Ref. [9]. Another approach for studying magnetosphere models of Schwarzschild black holes with non-magnetized\naccretion disks consists in solving the Grad-Shafranov equation, derived from the Einstein-Maxwell equations. A\nstationary axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere in a Schwarzschild geometry was studied in Ref. [10]. In this model\nthe black hole is connected by the magnetic field lines to a thin Keplerian disk. A uniform magnetic field at the event\nhorizon was found to be a reasonable assumption in the nonrotating limit. It also turned out that a uniform radial\nmagnetic field is still an excellent approximation for slowly rotating Keplerian disks.\nA static and spherically symmetric black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field was presented\nby Preston and Poisson [11]. An accretion disk in this geometry will have slightly modified properties compared to\nthe vacuum case, due to the weak magnetic field of this space-time. This is what we propose to study in this paper.\nThe Preston-Poisson metric was derived based on the light-cone gauge introduced in Ref. [11] for perturbed\nSchwarzschild black holes. This gauge preserves three convenient properties of the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates of the Schwarzschild metric. Namely (i) the advanced-time coordinate v is constant on incoming light cones\nthat converge toward the center, (ii) the polar and azimuthal angles are constant on the null generators of each light\ncone, (iii) the radial coordinate is an affine-parameter distance along each generator. In the unperturbed scenario\nthere is a fourth property, (iv) the radial coordinate r is an areal radius or curvature coordinate [12], defined by the\ncondition that the area of the 2-spheres with constant r is 4\u03c0r2 as in flat space. This fourth property is however not\nobeyed in a generic perturbed scenario.\nAs an application of the formalism Preston and Poisson have derived the perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric\narising from the immersion of the black hole into an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. By carefully performing\nthe integration, in top of the modifications induced by the magnetic field, they derive an additional tidal perturbation,\ndue to distant structures. Thus the Preston-Poisson perturbative solution represents a magnetized black-hole spacetime in which the tidal gravity is not directly tied to the magnetic field. In this sense it is a generalization of the\n\n\f2\nexact, two-parameter Schwarzschild-Melvin metric family, where all perturbations are of magnetic origin [13].\nThe magnetic field generates a quadrupolar deformation of the event horizon. Despite the penetration of the\nmagnetic field lines below the horizon its area stays unchanged. This is a combined consequence of the HawkingHartle formula [14], according to which the change of the area during the quasi-static perturbation is determined\nby the flux of energy T rr crossing the horizon; and of the particular form of T rr for this specific black hole, which\nvanishes on the horizon (at least to B 2 order, where B is the strength of the magnetic field).\nIn Ref. [15] Konoplya has rewritten the Preston-Poisson metric into a diagonal form by a suitable redefinition of\nthe radial variable and a replacement of the null coordinate by a temporal variable. For the latter a tortoise-type\ntransformation was employed. Then he has analyzed the motion of particles around such black holes. He has studied\nequatorial orbits and found that the tidal perturbations from surrounding sources have significant influence on the\nmotion of test particles. The time delay and the bending angle characterizing massless particles together with the\nbinding energy of massive particles have increased, while the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit is decreased\ndue to the presence of tidal forces.\nOur aim here is to study the accretion processes onto Preston-Poisson black holes, which incorporate both magnetic\nand tidal perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole. In Section 2 we present a short summary of the accretion\nprocess in the absence of the magnetic fields.\nIn Section 3 we briefly review the Preston-Poisson metric both in its original light-cone gauge form, and in the\ncoordinates presented in Ref. [15], employing also the analysis of the curvature invariants from Appendix A. We\nestablish the radial range over which this geometry describes a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole.\nWe analyze the geodesic motion in the equatorial plane in terms of an effective potential in Section 4.\nHere we also present the numerical study of the modifications induced by the magnetic field and tidal perturbations\nin the disk radiation, temperature profile, spectrum, luminosity and energy conversion efficiency for the PrestonPoisson black hole. For this we employ the explicit form of the energy-momentum tensor given in Appendix B.\nFinally, Section 5 contains the Concluding Remarks.\nII.\n\nTHE ACCRETION PROCESS\n\nIn the steady state accretion disk model physical quantities describing matter fields are averaged over the characteristic time scale \u2206t, total azimuthal angle 2\u03c0 and accretion disk height H (defined by its maximum half thickness).\nThe matter in the accretion disk is modeled by an anisotropic fluid, where the density \u03c10 of the rest mass (the\nspecific heat is neglected), the energy flow vector q a and stress tensor tab are defined in the averaged rest-frame of the\norbiting plasma with 4-velocity ua . The invariant algebraic decomposition of the stress-energy tensor is\nT ab = \u03c10 ua ub + 2u(a q b) + tab ,\nwhere ua qa = 0 = ua tab .\nIn this hydrodynamic approximation Page and Thorne [17] have derived the law of rest mass conservation, stating\nthat the time averaged rate of rest mass accretion is independent of the radius: \u1e400 \u2261 dM0 /dt = \u22122\u03c0r\u03a3ur = const.\n(Here t and r are the time and radial coordinates and \u03a3 is the averaged surface density). The integral form of the\nconservation laws of angular momentum and energy was also derived by averaging the continuity equation and the\ntotal divergence of the density-flux 4-vectors J a = T ab \u03c6b (angular momentum density-flux) and E a = \u2212T ab tb (energy\ndensity-flux), respectively. Here \u03c6a = \u2202/\u2202\u03c6 and ta = \u2202/\u2202t are the Killing vectors of the axially symmetric geometry\nand \u03c6 is the azimuthal coordinate.\nFrom the integral form of the conservation laws of energy and angular-momentum and the energy-angular momene,r = \u03a9L\ne ,r , Page and Thorne have expressed the time-averaged vertical component F (the photon flux)\ntum relation E\nof the energy flow vector q a as\nF (r) =\n\n\u1e400\n\u2212\u03a9,r\n\u221a\ne \u2212 \u03a9L)\ne 2\n4\u03c0 \u2212g (E\n\nZ\n\nr\n\nrms\n\ne \u2212 \u03a9L)\ne L\ne ,r dr .\n(E\n\n(1)\n\ne L\ne and \u03a9 = d\u03c6/dt are the specific energy, specific angular-momentum and angular velocity of the orbiting\nHere E,\nplasma particles with respect to the coordinate time t. The above formula is valid under the assumption that the\ntorque of the infalling matter on the disk vanishes at the inner edge of the disk (since the accreting matter reaching\nthe marginally stable orbit rms falls freely into the hole and cannot exert any considerable torque).\nSupposing that the electron-scattering opacity is negligible and the accretion disk is optically thick, the disk surface\nradiates a black body spectrum. Then the surface temperature T (r) of the disk is given by F (r) = \u03c3T 4 (r), with the\n\n\f3\nStefan-Boltzmann constant \u03c3. The disk luminosity L (\u03c9) is calculated as function of T (which is in turn expressed in\nterms of the thermal photon flux) as\nZ \u221e\nrdr\n4\u03c9 3\ncos \u03b9\n,\n(2)\nL (\u03c9) =\n\u03c0\nrms exp (\u03c9/T ) \u2212 1\nwhere \u03b9 is the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. For simplicity we assume cos \u03b9 = 1.\nAnother important characteristics of the mass accretion process is the efficiency with which the central object\nconverts rest mass into outgoing radiation. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of two rates evaluated at infinity: the\nrate of the radiated energy of photons escaping from the disk surface to infinity over the rate at which mass-energy is\ntransported to the black hole [2, 17]. If all emitted photons escape to infinity, the efficiency is given in terms of the\nspecific energy measured at the marginally stable orbit rms as\nems .\n\u01eb=1\u2212E\n\n(3)\n\nFor Schwarzschild black holes the efficiency \u01eb is about 6%, irrespective of whether photon capture by the black\nhole is taken into account or not. However, for rapidly rotating black holes, the efficiency \u01eb is found to be 42.3%,\ndecreasing slightly to 40% with photon capture by the black hole included [18].\nIII.\n\nPERTURBED SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE REGION OF THE PRESTON-POISSON\nSPACE-TIME\n\nIn this section we review the Preston-Poisson metric, both in the original light-cone gauge coordinates employed in\n[11] and in the coordinates introduced in Ref. [15]. The latter is essential in studying the accretion processes in the\nremaining part of the paper. Then we analyze the equatorial geometry and we establish the radial range where the\ninterpretation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole holds.\nThe Preston-Poisson metric represents a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole with perturbations caused by (i) an\nasymptotically uniform magnetic field B and (ii) independent tidal effects, described by a parameter K. The perturbations are such that the perturbed space-time is stationary and axially symmetric. In lowest order the rotational\nKilling vector of the space-time can be used to define the asymptotically uniform magnetic field [16], through the\n4-potential [11]\nAa = (0, 0, 0, B/2) .\nThe metric given in the light-cone gauge [in the Eddington-Finkelstein type coordinates (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6)] is\n\u0002\n\u0003\ngvv = \u2212f \u2212 19 B 2 r(3r \u2212 8M ) \u2212 19 B 2 (3r2 \u2212 14M r + 18M 2 ) \u2212 K(r \u2212 2M )2 (3 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 1) ,\ngvr = 1 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\ngv\u03b8 = 23 B 2 (r \u2212 3M ) \u2212 2K(r \u2212 2M ) r2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng\u03b8\u03b8 = r2 \u2212 13 B 2 r2 \u2212 B 2 M 2 \u2212 K(r2 \u2212 2M 2 ) r2 sin2 \u03b8 ,\n\u0003\n\u0002\ng\u03c6\u03c6 = r2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2212 31 B 2 r2 + B 2 M 2 + K(r2 \u2212 2M 2 ) r2 sin4 \u03b8 ,\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f = 1 \u2212 2M /r and M is the mass of the corresponding Schwarzschild black hole. This form of the metric\nis accurate up to (B 2 , K) order. [These are Eqs. (3.43)-(3.47) of Ref. [11] with the change of notation E \u2192 K.\nThey are also given as Eqs.(3)-(6) of Ref. [15], however the last term of the respective Eq.(3) should be corrected as\n\u2212K(r \u2212 2M )2 , while the last term of Eq.(4) as \u22122K(r \u2212 2M ).]\nThe area of spheres with radius r is modified by the magnetic field as\nZ \u03c0q\n\u0001\n2 d\u03b8 = 4\u03c0r2 1 \u2212 2 B 2 r2 ,\nAr=const = 2\u03c0\n(6)\ng\u03b8\u03b8 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u2212 g\u03b8\u03c6\n9\n0\n\nthus r fails to be a curvature coordinate.\nIn the perturbed space-time \u2202/\u2202t = (1, 0, 0, 0) remains a Killing vector.

(10)-(13) of Konoplya, however, the last term in the first line of Eq.

The area of the event horizon computed in these coordinates confirms\nEq. (8).\nNevertheless, the metric at the horizon is in fact perturbed, as can be seen by an explicit computation of the\ncurvature invariants, given in Appendix A. As the Kretschmann scalar Rabcd Rabcd and the Euler scalar \u2217 R\u2217abcd Rabcd\nshow an explicit \u03b8-dependence, we conclude that the horizon acquires the quadrupolar deformation.\nA glance at Eq. (11) shows that the interpretation of the Preston-Poisson metric as a perturbed black hole withstands\nonly while the parameters \u03b7B = B 2 r\u03042 and \u03b7K = K r\u03042 stay small.

We note that the back reaction of the disk on the static Preston-Poisson\ngeometry is neglected.\nIV.\n\nMODIFICATIONS IN THE ACCRETION INDUCED BY THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND TIDAL\nPARAMETER\n\nTo simplify our notation from now on we suppress the overbar from the Konoplya radial variable.\nA.\n\nOrbital motion in the equatorial plane\n\ne and specific angular momentum L\ne\nHere we analyze the radial dependence of the angular velocity \u03a9, specific energy E\nof particles moving in circular and equatorial orbits. The axially symmetric geometry is described by the metric (13)\n\n\f6\nand (18). In this approximation the off-diagonal components of the metric vanish and the geodesic equations for\nparticles orbiting in the equatorial plane of the black hole can be written as\n\u0012 \u00132\ndt\n2\ne2 ,\ngtt\n= E\nd\u03bb\n\u0012 \u00132\nd\u03c6\n2\ne2 ,\ng\u03c6\u03c6\n= L\nd\u03bb\n\u0012 \u00132\ndr\n2\ne2\n+ Vef\n(19)\n(gtt grr )2\nf (r) = E ,\nd\u03bb\nwhere \u03bb is the affine parameter, and the effective potential Vef f (r) is given by\n!\ne2\nL\n2\n.\nVef\nf (r) \u2261 gtt 1 + 2\nr\ne 2 and Vef f\nFrom the conditions Vef f = E\n1\nobtain\n\n,r\n\n(20)\n\n= 0, which define the circular orbits around the central object we\n\nd\u03c6\nu\u03c6\n\u03a9 =\n= t =\ndt\nu\n\ns\n\n\u2212gtt,r\n,\ng\u03c6\u03c6,r\ngtt\ne = \u2212ut = \u2212 p\n,\nE\n\u2212gtt \u2212 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a92\ne = u\u03c6 = p g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a9\nL\n\u2212gtt \u2212 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u03a92\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\ne 2 . Inserting Eq. (23) into Vef f,r = 0 the explicit expression\nSubstituting Eq. (23) into Vef f we obtain Vef f = E\n(21) for the angular velocity is recovered. The condition Vef f ,rr = 0 gives the marginally stable orbit (innermost\nstable circular orbit) rms .\nAs a first step we consider the radial dependence of the effective potential (20) of the perturbed Schwarzschild black\nhole and compare it with the non-perturbed case. In the left plot of Fig 2 we present the radial profile of the potential\nwith different values of the tidal parameter K in a magnetic field with fixed field strength of B = 10\u22124 M \u22121 . The\nparameter K is given as K = B 2 /2 + h, with h running between 10\u22124 M \u22122 and 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M \u22122 . Due to the presence\nof the asymptotically uniform magnetic field the perturbed Schwarzschild potential fails to be asymptotically flat, it\nactually diverges for r \u2192 \u221e.\nIncreasing the parameter K (or h) we also increase the steepness with which the potential tends to spatial infinity\nas we are receding from the central object. We have also checked that the divergent behavior of the potential appears\nalso if only one of the perturbations is present.\nOn the right plot of Fig 2 we have fixed K and set the magnetic field strength B to 10\u22124 M \u22121 , 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M \u22121 ,\n6 \u00d7 10\u22123M \u22121 and 10\u22122 M \u22121 , respectively. The variation of B modifies the steepness of how Vef f diverges for r \u2192 \u221e.\nWith increasing field strength the effective potential diverges faster in the spatial infinity.\nIn Fig 3 we present the radial dependence of the angular frequency, specific energy and specific angular momentum\nof the orbiting particle. All of these radial profiles indicate the perturbative presence of the asymptotically uniform\nmagnetic field. Close to the black hole the rotational velocity \u03a9 resembles the unperturbed Schwarzschild value. For\nhigher radii, however, each radial profile of \u03a9 has a less steep fall-off compared to the one for a standard accretion\ndisk in the non-perturbed system. Moreover, at certain radii \u03a9 is starting to increase. This unphysical model feature\ne and L\ne are also unbounded as r \u2192 \u221e.\nis explained in the following subsection. The radial profiles of E\nB.\n\nPhoton flux and disk temperature\n\nBy inserting Eqs. (21)-(23) into Eq.

As shown in Appendix B, the components\n\n1\n\ne = \u2212ut = gtt ut and\nFrom the normalization ua ua = \u22121 we get ut = (\u2212gtt \u2212 \u03a92 g\u03c6\u03c6 )\u22121/2 , which can be inserted into the expressions E\n\u03c6\nt\ne\nL = \u2212u\u03c6 = g\u03c6\u03c6 u = \u03a9gt\u03c6 u .

The solid line is the effective potential for a Schwarzschild black hole with the same total mass (B = 0 and K = 0).\nL\nOn the left plot B is set to 10\u22124 M \u22121 and the parameter h is running, while on the right h = 10\u22124 M \u22122 is fixed and different\nvalues of B are taken.\n\nTtr Ttz , T\u03c6r and T\u03c6z of the energy-momentum tensor for the magnetic field vanish. Since only these quantities appear in\nthe integral form of the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum specified for the steady-state equatorial\napproximation, the magnetic field does not contribute to the photon flux radiated by the accretion disk at all.\nTherefore, for a Schwarzschild black hole with magnetic perturbation we can employ the same flux formula as for\nvacuum.\nIn Fig 4 we plot the flux integral (1) for a black hole with mass 2\u00d7106M\u2299 and an accretion rate of 2.5\u00d710\u22126M\u2299 /yr,\nwith the same sets of values for the parameters B and K as for the effective potential. An increase of the parameters\nB and K results in smaller radii of both the marginally stable and largest radius bound orbits, which shifts both the\ninner and outer edges of the accretion disc towards the black hole. This can be seen in the plots of the flux emitted\nby the disk where the radial flux profiles shift to lower radii, compared with the radial distribution of F (r) for an\naccretion disk in Schwarzschild geometry.\nA closer comparison of the flux profile shapes with \u03a9 (r) on Fig 3 shows that for each parameter set the radius r2\nwhere F (r) = 0 holds is precisely where \u03a9 starts to increase. Going further outwards the flux would turn negative,\nindicating that the thin disk model breaks down at larger distances. Therefore we should consider our thin accretion\ndisk only extending between rms and r2 , letting the condition F (r) = 0 to determine the outer radius of the thin\ndisk.\n\u0001 \u22121\n\u22122\nOn the graphs\nthe approximate ranges of the perturbing\u0001 parameters are B \u2208 10\u22124 , 10\nM\nand K \u2208\n\u0001\n\u0001\n10\u22124 , 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M \u22122 . For these parameters \u03b7B \u2208 10\u22128 , 10\u22124 \u03b5\u22122 and \u03b7K \u2208 10\u22124 , 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03b5\u22122 , where \u03b5 = M/r\u0304\nis the post-Newtonian parameter. Thus the maximum values of both parameters \u03b7B and \u03b7K are of the order 10\u22124 \u03b5\u22122 .\nAs the accretion can be discussed only in the range where both the magnetic field and tidal effects can be considered\nas perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole, both parameters \u03b7B and \u03b7K have the upper limit 10\u22121 . Therefore\n10\u22124 \u03b5\u22122 . 10\u22121 and \u03b5 = M/r & 10\u22123/2 . As a consequence, the validity of the perturbed black hole picture holds in\nthe range\n2M . r\u0304 . 103/2 M \u2248 31M .\n\n(24)\n\nThe estimate of r1 \u2248 31M is in the range of the values for r2 readable from Fig 4. We have seen earlier that the\nperturbed black hole picture can be extended up to r1 only. Accretion disks are expected to exist only around central\nobjects. In the regions where the space-time is closer to a uniform magnetic field perturbed by a black hole, rather\nthan vice-versa, it is to be expected that accretion disks should not exist at all. As a first symptom of this, by\nincreasing the radius the thin disk approximation should become increasingly inaccurate. This is the reason why the\nradius r2 , where the thin disk approximation breaks down, has to be connected with r1 .\nWe note that r2 is more affected by the change of B or K then rms . For stronger perturbations the accretion disk\nis therefore located closer to the black hole and its surface area is reduced. However, the stronger magnetic field or\nhigher value of K increases the maximal intensity of the radiation without causing any significant shift in the peak of\nmaximal flux.\nSimilar signatures can be recognized in the radial profiles of the disk temperature, shown in Fig 5 for the same\n\n\f8\n2.5\u22c510-13\n\n1.5\u22c510-13\n\n1.0\u22c510-13\n\n5.0\u22c510-14\n\n20\nr/M\n\n30\n\n40\n\n10\n1.1\n\nB=0, h=0\nh=1x10-4\nh=2x10-4\nh=3x10-4\nh=4x10-4\n\n1.05\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n20\nr/M\n\n30\n\n40\n\n40\n\n50\n\nB=0, h=0\nB=1x10-4\nB=3x10-3\nB=6x10-3\nB=1x10-2\n\n1\n\n50\n\n10\n1\u22c51013\n\nB=0, h=0\nh=1x10-4\nh=2x10-4\nh=3x10-4\nh=4x10-4\n\n8\u22c51012\n~\nL (r) [cm2 s-1]\n\n~\nL (r) [cm2 s-1]\n\n30\n\n0.9\n10\n\n8\u22c51012\n\n20\nr/M\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n1\u22c51013\n\n1.0\u22c510-13\n\n50\n\n~\nE (r) [cm2 s-2]\n\n~\nE (r) [cm2 s-2]\n\n1.05\n\n1.5\u22c510-13\n\n5.0\u22c510-14\n\n10\n1.1\n\nB=0, h=0\nB=1x10-4\nB=3x10-3\nB=6x10-3\nB=1x10-2\n\n2.0\u22c510-13\n\n\u03a9(r) [rad s-1]\n\n2.0\u22c510-13\n\n\u03a9(r) [rad s-1]\n\n2.5\u22c510-13\n\nB=0, h=0\nh=1x10-4\nh=2x10-4\nh=3x10-4\nh=4x10-4\n\n6\u22c51012\n\n4\u22c51012\n\n2\u22c51012\n\n20\nr/M\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nB=0, h=0\nB=1x10-4\nB=3x10-3\nB=6x10-3\nB=1x10-2\n\n6\u22c51012\n\n4\u22c51012\n\n2\u22c51012\n10\n\n20\nr/M\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\n20\nr/M\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ne and specific angular momentum L\ne of particles orbiting around a perturbed\nFIG. 3: The angular velocity \u03a9, specific energy E\nSchwarzschild black hole of total mass M .

(2) and represented with the same values of the perturbations as for\nthe other plots. The characteristic shape of the spectra on Fig 6 shows a uniform increase at low frequencies (on a\nlogarithmic scale) followed by a sharp decrease at high frequencies, ending in a cut-off at \u223c 1016 Hz. Moreover, we\nnote that in the presence of perturbations the spectrum is blue-shifted in comparison with the Schwarzschild case.\nThe shift of the spectrum towards higher energies indicates that besides the accreted mass-energy also some magnetic\nfield energy is converted into radiation.\nFinally, we give the conversion efficiency \u01eb of the accreting mass into radiation in the perturbed system for the\ndifferent values of the parameters B and K employed earlier in our analysis. In Table I we give both the marginally\nstable orbit, at which the specific energy is evaluated in the calculation of \u01eb given in Eq.

Then a convenient way to determine the mass and the\nspin of the central black hole is to fit the flux profile and the spectrum derived from the simple disk model on the\nobservational data. For static black holes, the analysis of the deviations of the disk radiation from the Schwarzschild\ncase could indicate the presence of a magnetic field.\nIn this paper we have discussed the mass accretion process in the region of the Preston-Poisson space-time representing a Schwarzschild black hole perturbed by a weak magnetic field (which is however asymptotically uniform) and\na distant tidal structure. For this we have (a) determined the region where this interpretation holds; (b) corrected the\ndynamical equations of test particles valid in the equatorial plane; and (c) applied the hydrodynamic approximation\nfor the orbiting plasma.\nThe study of the perturbations included in the accretion process showed that (i) the thin disk model can be\napproximately applied until the radius where the perturbed Schwarzschild black hole interpretation holds; (ii) the\naccretion disk shrinks and the marginally stable orbit shifts towards the black hole with the perturbation; (iii) the\nintensity of the radiation from the accretion disk increases, while the radius where the radiation is maximal remains\nunchanged; (iv) the spectrum is slightly blue-shifted; and finally (v) the conversion efficiency of accreting mass into\nradiation is decreased by both the magnetic and the tidal perturbations.\nWe represent the system under discussion on Fig 7. Although the topology of magnetospheres around black holes is\n\n\f11\n\n30\n20\n10\nz\nM\n\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-30 -20 -10\n\n0\nr\nM\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFIG. 7: The black hole horizon, the thin accretion disk (between rms = 5.8M and r1 = 31M ) and the magnetic field topology\n(for B = 10\u22122 M \u22121 ).\n\nlikely to be more complicated than the simple model considered here, the blue shifted disk spectrum indicating that\nsome of the magnetic field energy also contributes to the radiation may be a generic feature, signaling the presence\nof a magnetic field. This conjecture is supported by the recent finding that symbiotic systems of black holes in fast\nrotation, accretion disk, jets and magnetic fields have a very similar magnetic field topology to the one represented\non Fig 7, consisting of open field lines only [9].\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Sergei Winitzki for interactions in the early stages of this work.

Throughout the computations\n(except otherwise stated) the coordinates (9)-(10) of Konoplya are used. The results are valid up to (B 2 , K) order.\nWe found that:\n(i) The perturbations are such that the Ricci scalar vanishes to (B 2 , K) order, R = 0.\n(ii) With the use of light-cone gauge coordinates the Kretschmann scalar K = Rabcd Rabcd is\nK=\nwhich on the horizon (7) becomes\nK|r=rH =\n\n\u0001\u0003\n48M \u0002\nM + Kr3 2 \u2212 3 sin2 \u03b8 ,\nr6\n\n\u0003\n3 \u0002\n1 + 16M 2 K \u2212 4M 2 (B 2 + 6K) sin2 \u03b8 .\n4M 4\n\n(A1)\n\n(A2)\n\nSince the Ricci scalar vanishes the contraction of the Weyl tensor gives the same expression, Cabcd C abcd = K.\nThe Kretschmann scalar calculated in the Konoplya coordinates (9)-(10) is\nK =\n\n48M\n{M + 2M B 2 r\u0304(2M \u2212 r\u0304) \u2212 2K r\u0304(4M 2 \u2212 2M r\u0304 \u2212 r\u03042 )\nr\u03046\n+r\u0304[3K(4M 2 \u2212 2M r\u0304 \u2212 r\u03042 ) \u2212 2M B 2 (3M \u2212 r\u0304)] sin2 \u03b8} ,\n\nwhich agrees with (A1) after the coordinate transformation (10).\n\n(A3)\n\n\f12\n(iii) The contraction of the Weyl tensor with the Killing vectors ta = (1, 0, 0, 0) and \u03c6a = (0, 0, 0, 1) is\nCabcd ta \u03c6b tc \u03c6d = C0303 =\n\n(2M \u2212 r\u0304) sin2 \u03b8\n{3M + [K(4M 2 \u2212 4M r\u0304 + 3r\u03042 ) \u2212 2M B 2 (M \u2212 r\u0304)]r\u0304\n3r\u03042\n+3M [2K(M 2 \u2212 M r\u0304 \u2212 r\u03042 ) \u2212 B 2 (M 2 \u2212 M r\u0304 + r\u03042 )] sin2 \u03b8} .\n\n(A4)\n\nThis quantity vanishes on the horizon.

Similar contractions with the Weyl tensor give identical results.\nOn the horizon, the Euler scalar becomes\n\u2217\n\nR\u2217abcd Rabcd = \u2212\n\n1\n{3 \u2212 4M 2 [2(B 2 \u2212 8K) + 3(B 2 + 8K) sin2 \u03b8]} .\n64M 8 sin2 \u03b8\n\n(A6)\n\nIn conclusion, as the Kretschmann scalar K and the scalar \u2217 R\u2217abcd Rabcd exhibit a \u03b8-dependence on the horizon, we\nconclude that despite the spherical shape of the horizon in the Konoplya coordinates, it has acquired a quadrupolar\ndeformation due to the perturbing magnetic and tidal effects.\nAppendix B: The energy-momentum tensor\n\nSince the coordinate transformation from the Eddington-Finkelstein type coordinates (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) to Konoplya coordinates [15] does not affect the angular variables \u03b8 and \u03c6 the form of the vector potential (4) remains unchanged in\nthe new coordinate system.
