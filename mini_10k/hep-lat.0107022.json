There are several\npuzzles that seem to have resisted a decade of efforts to\nunderstand them. The one we focus on involves the static\nscreening of certain excitations of the plasma.\n\nquestion we address.\nThe overlap Dirac operator (D) can be defined [14] in\nterms of the Wilson-Dirac operator (Dw ) by the relation\n\u2020\nD = 1 \u2212 Dw (Dw\nDw )\u22121/2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe computation of D\u22121 needs a nested series of two\nmatrix inversions for its evaluation (each step in the nu\u2020\nmerical inversion of D involves the inversion of Dw\nDw ).\nThis squaring of effort makes a study of QCD with dynamical overlap quarks very expensive. As a first step in\nthis direction, we chose to work with quenched overlap\nquarks: to study the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration and screening masses at high temperature.\nWe generated quenched QCD configurations at temperatures of T /Tc = 1.25, 1.5 and 2 on 4 \u00d7 83 and 4 \u00d7 123\nlattices (see Table I). The corresponding couplings are respectively \u03b2 = 5.8, 5.8941 and 6.0625. The configurations\nwere separated by 1000 sweeps of a Cabibo-Marinari update. A previous computation [15] with T = 0 quenched\noverlap quarks at the nearby couplings of \u03b2 = 5.85 and\n6.0 allows us to compare finite and zero temperature\nphysics.\n\u2020\nFor the matrix M = Dw\nDw , and a given source vector b, we computed y = M \u22121/2 b by a conjugate gradient\n(CG) version of a proposed Lancz\u00f6s method [16]. CG\ngives better control over errors than Lancz\u00f6s or other\nmethods based on approximations using Chebychev or\nReeves polynomials. In CG, the vector x = M \u22121 b is obtained by iterating the residual vector ri+1 = ri \u2212 \u03b1i M pi\nand the direction of change pi+1 = \u03b2i+1 pi + ri+1 , where\n\u03b1i = (ri , ri )/(pi , M pi ) and \u03b2i+1 = (ri+1 , ri+1 )/(ri , ri ).\nThe iterations are stopped when (ri , ri ) < \u01eb, for a predetermined tolerance \u01eb. Let Ns be the number of CGiterations at stopping. In the orthonormal basis made of\nqi = ri /(ri , ri )1/2 , the matrix M can be approximated\nby Q\u2020 T Q, where Q is made from the set {qi } and T is\na tridiagonal symmetric matrix of dimension Ns . The\nnon-zero elements of T are Ti,i = 1/\u03b1i + \u03b2i /\u03b1i\u22121 and\n\nIt has long been understood that the screening of currents in a plasma would give us information on its excitations. Currents with certain quantum numbers excite\nmesons from the vacuum at low temperatures, and should\nexhibit deconfinement related changes above the QCD\nphase transition temperature (Tc ) [5]. Detailed studies\nhave shown that this indeed does happen in the vector, and axial-vector channels: the screening above Tc\nis clearly due to nearly non-interacting quark anti-quark\npairs in the medium [6,7]. On the other hand, the scalar\nand pseudo-scalar screening masses show more complicated behavior- strong deviations from the ideal Fermi\ngas, and a strong temperature dependence. This puzzling behavior is generic- it has been seen in quenched\n[8] and dynamical simulations with two [9] and four flavors [5\u20137,10] of staggered quarks, as well as with Wilson\nquarks [11]. This is the puzzle that we address and solve\nin this letter.\nThe new technique we bring to bear on this problem is to use a version of lattice Fermions called overlap\nFermions [12]. It has the advantage of preserving chiral symmetry on the lattice for any number of massless\nflavors of quarks [13]. This is in contrast to other formulations such as Wilson Fermions which break all chiral symmetries or staggered Fermions which break them\npartially. Since the number of pions and their nature is\nintimately related to the actually realized chiral symmetry on the lattice, we should expect any realization of\nchiral Fermions on the lattice to provide insight into the\n1\n\n\f\u221a\nTi,i+1 = \u2212 \u03b2i /\u03b1i\u22121 . Denoting by \u039b the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of T , and by U its diagonalizer\nmade from the corresponding eigenvectors, the desired\nsolution is y = M \u22121/2 b \u2243 Q\u2020 U \u2020 \u039b\u22121/2 U Qb, when the CG\niterations are started with r0 = p0 = b.\n\nconfigurations we found zero and near-zero modes with\n\u22124\n\u03bc2 <\n\u223c 10 clearly seperated by a gap from the non-zero\n2\nmodes with 0.1 <\n\u223c \u03bc [19]. The non-zero modes clearly\ncame in degenerate pairs of opposite chiralities. For\nT = 1.5Tc and 2Tc the zero modes were all less than 10\u22127\nand of definite chirality. Their numbers decreased rapidly\nwith either increasing T or decreasing lattice size (see\nTable I for details). We constructed a gauge-invariant\nmeasure of localization [20] for a normalised eigenvector\n\u03a6(i) where i stands for position, spin and color, as the\nfollowing sum,\n\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n12\n\n0.02\n00\n0.1\n\n10\n8\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n6\n\n8\n\n0.08\n\n4\n10\n\n12\n\n2\n0\n\n\u03c3=\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\nX\n\nsites\n12\n\n0.02\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\nX\n\nspin,color\n\n\uf8f92\n\n\u03a6(i)\u03a6(i)\uf8fb .\n\n(4)\n\n10\n\n00\n\n8\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n6\n\n8\n\nThis varies from unity for an eigenmode localized at just\none site to 1/V for an eigenmode spread uniformly on\na lattice of volume V . On 4 \u00d7 123 lattices we found\n\u03c3 \u2243 (3 \u2212 8) \u00d7 10\u22123 for the zero modes and \u03c3 < 10\u22123 for\nthe non-zero modes (see Figure 1). At T = 1.25Tc we\n\u22124\nalso found near-zero modes with \u03bc2 <\n\u223c 10 . These were\nas localised as the zero modes, but came paired in parity\nlike the non-zero modes.\nThe zero modes of chiral Fermions are related to\ninstanton-like configurations [21]. These are, in turn,\nknown to break axial U (1) symmetry.

The zero eigenvector\n(top) is strongly localized while the non-zero eigenvector (bottom) is not.\n\nA massive overlap operator is defined by\nD(ma) = ma + (1 \u2212 ma/2)D,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m is the bare quark mass, a the lattice spacing,\nand D is defined in (1). We used the usual quark propagator, G(ma) = [1 \u2212 D/2]D\u22121 (ma) [14]. We computed\nG on 12 point sources (3 colors and 4 spins) for 10 quark\nmasses from ma=0.001 to 0.5 using a multimass inversion of D\u2020 D. The (negative) Wilson mass term in Dw ,\nwhich is an irrelevant regulator, was set to 1.8. The tolerance was \u01eb = 10\u22126 in the inner CG and 10\u22124 in the outer\nCG. A rough computation of the eigenvalues of D\u2020 D, \u03bc2 ,\nwas made on each configuration with a Lancz\u00f6s method\nin each chiral sector. Whenever \u03bc2 \u2243 O(10\u22125 ) was obtained, the few lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors were\nrefined to a precision of about 10\u22128 by a Ritz functional\nminimization.\nFor each configuration we verified that the GinspargWilson [17] relation is satisfied to an accuracy of 10\u22129 ,\nthus ensuring a very precise implementation of chiral\nsymmetry for our simulations. Another test of the precision of our measurements was provided by a check of the\nchiral Ward identity-\na 2 \u03c7P S =\n\n1 3\na h\u03c8\u03c8i,\nma\n\n\u03c9 = \u03c73S \u2212 \u03c70S =\n\n4 h(n+ \u2212 n\u2212 )2 i\n,\nm2\nV\n\n(5)\n\nwhere n+ and n\u2212 are the number of eigenvalues of D\nwith left and right handed chiralities, and the difference\nneeds to be evaluated only for the zero modes. In the\nquenched theory \u03c9, if non-zero, is singular in the m \u2192 0\nlimit since h(n+ \u2212 n\u2212 )2 i is independent of m. This is\nrelated to well known problems with \u03c70S in the quenched\ntheory [23]. Combining our data with [24], we find some\nevidence that h(n+ \u2212 n\u2212 )2 i/V falls as a high power of\nT /Tc. Nevertheless in quenched QCD, U (1) symmetry is\nnot completely restored even at 2Tc.\nOur measurement of h\u03c8\u03c8i comes from the diagonal\npart of G(ma) on the 12 sources used for each configuration. The analysis proceeds by writing G in terms of the\neigenvectors \u03a6\u03bc\u03b1 of D\u2020 D with eigenvalue \u03bc2 and chirality\n\u03b1,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere h\u03c8\u03c8i is the chiral condensate and \u03c7P S is the pseudoscalar susceptibility [18]. In all our computations we\nfound that the equality was satisfied to better than 1 part\nin 105 .\nFor most configurations we found that the spectrum\nof D\u2020 D starts well away from zero. However, for some\n\nGij =\n\nX\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03a6\u03bc\u03b1 (i)\u03a6\u03b2 (j)\n\nma\u03bb2 \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2212 i\u03bc\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 )\n, (6)\n\u03bc2 + (ma)2 \u03bb2\n\nwhere \u03bb2 = 1\u2212\u03bc2 /4. The contribution of a zero mode can\nbe easily read off from the equation above and is seen to\nbe proportional to \u03a6\u03a6 and 1/ma. Since the eigenvector\n2\n\n\fcorresponding to the zero mode is localized, its contribution to the condensate depends strongly on the spatial position of the source vector. The remaining modes\nare delocalized and closely spaced; so the overlap of the\neigenvector on the source is averaged out.\n\n1\n\nC(z)\n\n-1\n10\n\n-2\n10\n\n-3\n10\n\n0.86\n0.84\n\n-4\n10\n\na3<\u03c8\u03c8>/ma\n\n0.82\n0.80\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nz\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0.78\n0.76\n\nFIG. 3.

Data\nfor 1.5Tc and 2Tc are displaced in ma for visibility.\n\nIt is clear from the chiral Ward identity (3) that large\nfluctuations in h\u03c8\u03c8i due to the zero mode must also lead\nto similiar non-statistical fluctuations in CP S . Further,\nsince a zero mode contributes identically to CS and CP S ,\nthe two can even have the same sign if this contribution\nis large enough [26]. Ignoring the configurations with\nzero modes, the S and PS correlators do obey the identity in (7), suggesting that simple results could be seen\nby eliminating the zero mode contribution.\n\nOur precise determination of the eigenvectors and\neigenvalues allows us to subtract out the zero mode contributions in (6), although it can sometimes be a couple\nof orders of magnitude larger than the remainder. The\nsubtracted condensate is strikingly identical to that seen\nin the sample without zero modes, at all the couplings\nand lattice sizes studied. We found that h\u03c8\u03c8i varies linearly with ma and goes to zero as ma \u2192 0. This is how\nchiral symmetry restoration manifests itself in quenched\nQCD.\nIn the thermodynamic and continuum limits, it is not\nclear whether the near-zero modes are related to chiral\nsymmetry breaking; on any finite V they are not, but\nin these limits they may accumulate at zero. If they do,\nthen h\u03c8\u03c8i would not go to zero with m even above Tc\nin the quenched theory. Clearly, one needs to examine\nthese limits very carefully. At T = 1.25Tc the number\nof near-zero modes is insignificant, but it seems that for\nT < 1.25Tc their numbers will be larger [24] and the\nm \u2192 0 limit will have to be taken after the V \u2192 \u221e\nlimit. Quite likely, such a limit may have to be taken at\nmore than one lattice spacing.\nFor lattice Fermions which satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson\nrelation [17], the following identities hold in the chirally\nsymmetric phase as ma \u2192 0,\n\nOne way to do this is to use the measured \u03a6's to\nsubtract the zero modes and construct a new correlator\nC P S (z). Alternatively, we could consider the difference,\n(CS (z) \u2212 CP S (z))/2, which should equal C P S (z). Figure\n3 exhibits the comparison of the three correlators. Similar excellent agreement is also seen for these correlators\nfor all ma < 0.1 and at other T .\n\n(7)\n\nAfter subtracting the effects of the zero mode, we find\nthat the correlator identities are satisfied for the S/PS\nsector as well as V/AV. In addition, CV is described well\nby an ideal gas of overlap quarks on the same lattice, as illustrated in Figure 4 (although the figure shows this only\nfor one quark mass and T , this is true for all T \u2265 1.25 Tc\nand all ma < 0.1). While CP S seems to differ from the\nideal gas result, the measured values of the PS screening\nmasses, MP S , are only 10% smaller than ideal gas screening masses. This difference is small enough to be plausibly explained in a weak-coupling computation, quite\nunlike earlier results from staggered or Wilson quarks.\n\nHere C is the screening correlation function in the spatial z direction of an operator summed in the other three\ndirections. The subscripts P S refer to a pseudo-scalar\noperator, S to a scalar, V to a vector and AV to an\naxial-vector [25]. We find that the V and AV correlators\nindeed agree at all z and at all temperatures we studied. This is in agreement with our conclusion that the\ntemperature range we studied has chiral symmetry.\n\nDifferences between T = 0 mesons and our measurements are extremely clear. For T \u2265 1.25Tc, MP S is constant and non-vanishing for ma <\n\u223c 0.1. In the same temperature range, the ratio mP S (T )/mV (T ) is within 10%\nof unity and quite different from the measured values at\nT = 0 at nearby couplings \u03b2 [15]. Thus, the simple picture that emerges is a property of the high temperature\nphase of (quenched) QCD.\n\nCS (z) = \u2212CP S (z)\n\nand CV (z) = CAV (z).\n\n3\n\n\f1\n\n[7] R. V. Gavai and S.

The screening correlators on 4.123 lattices at\nT = 1.5Tc for ma = 0.001, in analyses without zero modes.\nThe V/AV correlators (boxes) agree very well with the ideal\ngas computation (solid line), and the S/PS correlators (circles) are also similar.\n\nIn conclusion, working with chiral (overlap) Fermions,\nwe have found several new results and a consistent picture\nof the high temperature phase of quenched QCD. Axial\nU (1) symmetry is not restored even at 2Tc. As a result\nthe thermal ensemble contains gauge fields which give rise\nto Fermion zero modes of definite chirality. When the effect of these modes is subtracted, h\u03c8\u03c8i vanishes in the\nzero quark mass limit, showing that chiral symmetry is\nrestored. Simultaneously, parity doubling is seen in the\nspectrum of screening masses, which are close to those\nexpected in an ideal Fermi gas, even for the S/PS sector.\nSince some of these results are not obtained with staggered quarks, it is an interesting question whether the\ntwo flavor QCD phase transition is properly described\nby such a representation of quarks.\nSome interesting problems remain to be solved. At\nT \u2264 1.25 Tc , there are near-zero modes. It cannot be\nruled out that these modes shift the quenched chiral symmetry restoration point away from Tc . However, this\nquestion is crucially related to the evolution of near-zero\nmodes with lattice volume and spacing. Hence the nature\nof these complications, and the question of whether they\nare quenched artifacts or remain in full QCD, will only\nbecome clear with further studies which are underway.\nThis work was funded by the IFCPAR as its project\n2104-2.\n\nT /Tc\nV Nc N0 N0\u2032 h\u03c8\u03c8i/(mT 2 ) MP S /T\n1.25 4 \u00d7 123 50 18 4\n13.24 (9)\n6.0 (2)\n1.50 4 \u00d7 123 50 8\n0\n13.31 (8)\n6.0 (1)\n2.00 4 \u00d7 123 50 1\n0\n13.44 (6)\n6.0 (1)\n1.50\n4 \u00d7 83 100 1\n0\n13.36 (5)\n6.0 (2)\n2.00\n4 \u00d7 83 26 0\n0\n13.34 (8)\n6.0 (1)\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nElectronic mail: gavai@tifr.res.in\nElectronic mail: sgupta@tifr.res.in\nElectronic mail: lacaze@spht.saclay.cea.fr\nProceedings of the Quark Matter 2001 meeting.\nC.
