Time\nconstraints, however, tend to focus the attention of most\nintroductory electromagnetism (EM) courses to the analytical solution of only a few highly symmetrical cases,\nsuch as the field along the axis of a circular coil or inside\nan infinite solenoid1\u20135 . Nevertheless, many applications\nrequire at least an estimate of the full vector field in regions away from the axis6,7 , which involve mathematical\ntools often not discussed at the introductory level. On\nthe other hand, most EM courses already dedicate a fair\namount of time teaching students to identify and solve\nelectrostatic problems using the Laplace equation. In\nsome cases the same methods can be applied to magnetostatic problems, sometimes leading to useful insights.\nSadly, most students do not usually appreciate the\nsimilarities between the two classes of problems8 due\nto a limited exposure to practical examples involving\nthe magnetostatic potential. We feel that this ability\nis useful9 , particularly because scalar potentials are generally more intuitive and easier to visualize. Besides, a\nunified treatment could be pedagogically relevant in generalizing the discussion of the multipole expansions10\u201312 .\nTherefore, the primary goal here is to present a couple of\npedagogical examples illustrating the application of the\nmagnetostatic potential method to real solenoids.\nIn addition, these examples also offer the opportunity\nto discuss in the classroom axisymmetric fields evaluated\noff-axis, without the need to introduce the formalism of\nelliptic integrals. Although other methods for finding\noff-axis magnetic fields have been mentioned earlier in\n\nthe literature6,7 , to our knowledge this has not been presented from such a simple and intuitive viewpoint.\nMoreover, as further motivation, we have chosen an example that brings a real and practical application from\nthe cutting edge of research into the classroom: a nonuniform solenoid used in many research laboratories to\nproduce beams of slow (cold) atoms. This solenoid, called\na Zeeman-slower13\u201315 , is used in conjunction with appropriately prepared laser beams to slow down and cool neutral atoms, from hundreds of Kelvin to milliKelvin temperatures, by combining the action of radiation pressure\nwith the Zeeman effect. This device is one of the staple\ndevelopments in the area of laser cooling16,17 , and one of\nthe enabling technologies leading to the 1997 Nobel prize\nin Physics18 . The techniques for laser cooling and trapping of atoms have produced many dramatic advancements in our understanding of quantum physics19 , including the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation20 ,\nwhich was recognized with another Nobel prize18 in 2001.\nIn both cases, magnetic fields have been an important\npart of experimental design and data interpretation. Educators can astutely use the solenoid discussed here, as\nwell as the references herein, to introduce and discuss\nsome of these modern developments in quantum physics,\nmaking the subject even more interesting to students.\n\nII.\n\nREVIEWING SOME BASIC CONCEPTS\n\nWe begin here by recalling the fundamental equation\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nof magnetostatics : \u2207 \u00d7 H = J , where H is the mag\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nnetic field and J the current density. Typically H is\n\u2192\n\u2212\nrelated to the magnetic induction field B by some con-\n\n\f2\nstitutive relation expressing the properties of a particular material. For linear and isotropic materials, with a\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nmagnetic permeability \u03bc, B = \u03bc H and in a current-free\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nregion \u2207 \u00d7 B = 0, implying that B = \u2212 \u2207\u03c6M . Since\n\u2192\n\u2212 \u2192\n\u2212\nMaxwell's equations also state that \u2207 * B = 0, this results in \u22072 \u03c6M = 0, which is Laplace's equation for the\nmagnetic potential \u03c6M , in any current-free region.\nAlthough Laplace's equation is only typically valid in\na region free of charges or currents, these are allowed to\nexist on or outside a surface S surrounding that region.\nThe solutions of Laplace's equation present three important properties: superposition, smoothness and uniqueness. The property of superposition results from the fact\nthat Laplace's equation is a linear equation. Smoothness\nimplies that no solution in a region V of space, bounded\nby a surface S, can present either a maximum or a minimum within V (extreme values can occur only at the\nsurface S). The third property is the one most relevant\nto us here, as it states3 that if one finds a solution \u03c6M , in\na region of space consistent with the prescribed boundary conditions, that solution is unique up to an additive\nconstant. Therefore, it does not matter what particular\nmethod is used to find the solution. Once an appropriate\nsolution is found, it is uniquely valid.\nHowever, despite the obvious similarities between the\nelectrostatic and magnetostatic potentials, there are indeed reasons why the analogy can only be taken so far8,10 ,\nand is not widely explored further in textbooks. The first\n\u2192\n\u2212\none arises whenever J 6= 0, in which case it is not trivial\n\u2192\n\u2212\nto write a relation between \u03c6M and J . The second complication occurs due to the fact that the scalar potential\nis generally a multiply valued function, requiring a prescription specifying where it can be used. However, as it\nhas been shown by Bronzan10 , these complications can\nbe overcome, permitting one to exploit the advantages of\nthe concept of a scalar magnetic potential.\n\nIII.\n\nWe start by considering the field in the interior of a finite uniform solenoid carrying a current I, as illustrated\nin Fig. 1. For generality and convenience, we describe\nthe problem using spherical coordinates. In this geometry it is easy to note that due to the axial symmetry of\nthe problem the field B(z) depends only on z = r cos \u03b8.\nThe magnetostatic potential can be found using for a\nboundary condition the magnitude of the field along z,\nwhich is readily available through simple summation formulas over the approximately circular coils forming the\nsolenoid.\nIn spherical coordinates, the solution of the axisymmetric scalar potential \u03c6M can be written in the form:\n\u03c6M (r, \u03b8) =\n\n`=0\n\n`\n\na` r +\n\nb`\nr`+1\n\n\u0013\nP` (cos \u03b8),\n\nx\nr\n\nR\n\n\u03b8\n\nz\n\nL\n\nb)\n\nx\n\nB\u03b8\n\nBr\n\nr\n\u03b8\n\nz\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of a finite and homogenous solenoid. The relevant coordinates are presented in (a),\nwhile their details are shown in (b). The crosses (dots) represent current flowing into (out of) the plane of the page.\n\nwhere a` and b` are coefficients to be determined and the\nP` represents a Legendre polynomial of order `.\nBecause we are mainly interested in the values of the\nfield inside the solenoid, we set b` = 0 to avoid the singularity at r = 0. As a result, the potential takes the\nsimpler form:\n\u03c6M (r, \u03b8) = a0 + a1 rP1 (cos \u03b8) + a2 r2 P2 (cos \u03b8) + . . . . (2)\nFor points along the z-axis, we have cos \u03b8 = 1 and\nEq. (2) becomes\n\u03c6M (z) = a0 + a1 z + a2 z 2 + a3 z 3 + . . . .\n\n(3)\n\nIncidentally, we can in general also expand the scalar\npotential in a Taylor series around some point z0 ,\n(z \u2212 z0 )2 \u2202 2 \u03c6M\n\u2202\u03c6M\n|z0 +\n|z0 + . . . ,\n\u2202z\n2!\n\u2202z 2\n(4)\nand comparing it to Eq. (3), for z0 = 0, we obtain the\ncoefficients a` in terms of the series expansion\n\u03c6M (z) = \u03c6M (z0 )+(z\u2212z0 )\n\nTHE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A FINITE\nUNIFORM SOLENOID\n\n\u221e \u0012\nX\n\na)\n\n(1)\n\n1 \u2202 ` \u03c6M (z)\n|z=0 .\n(5)\n`! \u2202z `\nIn this way, the full scalar potential becomes analytically\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\ndeterminable, allowing us to evaluate B = \u2212 \u2207\u03c6M at\nany point in space where equations (2) and (4) appliy.\nAs a first example, let us now consider the case of\na finite solenoid of length L and radius R, carrying a\nuniform current I. If the solenoid has N turns per unit\nlength, the magnetic field along the z-axis can be easily\ncalculated by integrating the expression for the axial field\nof a circular current loop1 , resulting in:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nz\nz\n+\n\u2212\n\uf8fb,\nB(z) = \u03b1 \uf8f0 q\n\u2212q\n(6)\n2\n2\nR2 + z+\nR2 + z\u2212\na0 = \u03c6M (0); . . . ; a` =\n\n\fL\n2,\n\nwhere z\u00b1 = z \u00b1\nsince\n\n\u00c8B\u00c8, Bz , B \u03a1 @mTD\n\nand \u03b1 = \u03bc0 N I/4\u03c0 in SI units.

All the\nresults were evaluated off-axis, at \u03c1 = 8 cm, and the analytical\nresults are shown for expansions up to third (dashed-black)\nand fifteenth (solid-red) orders. The inset in (a) shows the\ngood agreement obtained near z=0.\n\nFurther, in Fig. 3, we compare the analytical results\nobtained by keeping the first eight terms in the expansion (corresponding to the fifteenth order in r) against\nthe numerical calculations shown in Fig. 2. In addition,\nFig. 3 also shows the good partial agreement obtained using the third order approximation, extending to distances\nup to about half the size of the solenoid. Note that, for\na real finite system, the disagreement increases rapidly\nafter some point. That can be improved significantly by\nincluding higher order terms, allowing for a much better\napproximation near the edges, as shown in Fig. 3. However, due to the simplifications made, the approximate\nanalytical result does not contain all the physics of the\nproblem. For instance, it does not accurately describe the\nfield outside the solenoid, and it will most likely fail out-\n\nwhere Bb , B0 and \u03b2 are constants. Such a field is suitable\nfor slowing atomic beams using laser light13 . The field\nof Eq. (16) causes a spatially varying Zeeman effect that\ncompensates for the changing Doppler shift of the moving\natoms, thus keeping them in resonance with the light as\nthey decelerate along the beam path. This technique is\ncalled Zeeman slowing13 , and the parabolic shape is chosen to keep the radiation pressure constant, typically at\na rate of \u223c 106 m/s2 , throughout the Zeeman solenoid15\nshown in Figure 4.\nIn general, the atomic beam encompasses a certain\nsolid angle as it traverses the solenoid and most atoms\nfollow trajectories which do not lie exactly on the axis.\nSince the resonance condition with the laser depends on\nboth the magnitude (via the detuning) and direction (via\nthe polarization) of the magnetic field, the knowledge\nof the off-axis field is important in understanding how\nlight interacts with atoms at different points inside the\nsolenoid.\nThe magnetic potential along the z-axis, in this case,\ntakes the form\nZ\n3\n2 B0\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2z) 2 , (17)\n\u03c6M (z) = \u2212 B(z 0 )dz 0 = \u2212Bb z +\n3 \u03b2\nwhere the constant of integration has been suppressed.\nFollowing the same steps in section III, and after calculating the derivatives and solving for the coefficients\na` , we obtain the general form of the magnetic potential\nfor the Zeeman solenoid:\n2 B0\n\u2212 (Bb + B0 )r cos \u03b8\n(18)\n3 \u03b2\n\u0001\n\u221e\nB0 X \u03b2 n\u22121 \u0393 n \u2212 21 n\n+\u221a\nr Pn (cos \u03b8),\n\u03c0 n=2 n!(2n \u2212 3)\n\n\u03c6M (r, \u03b8) =\n\nwhere \u0393(n) is the gamma function.

(16). Although caution may be\nnecessary when evaluating the field for \u03c1 = 0 (\u03b8 = 0), the\ncareful use of L'Hospital's rule ensures correct answers.\nNow, to compare these analytical approximations to\nthe experimental field represented in Fig. 5, we will follow a different approach. The motivation here is to mimic\na situation where the current distribution that generates\nthe field may not be known exactly, but the axial field\ncan be measured directly in the laboratory. This could\nbe the case in a real practical application, where imperfections in the winding pattern often are not considered\nin the ideal model. From the experimental data one can\nthen build a mathematical model, using either a fitting\nfunction (if the functional form is known or could be easily guessed), or by using an interpolating function, such\n\n\f6\nas a polynomial, to represent the data in a limited region\nof space. Here, since the approximate functional form of\nthe axial field is known, we will extract the model parameters by numerically fitting the data in Fig. 5, to Bz (z) in\nEq. (16), and substituting them in the expressions (21)\nand (22). Note that the limitations of this type of modeling may result in some inaccuracies, particularly close\nto the edges. In any practical situation one may need\nto explore different approaches to find a mathematical\nmodel accurate enough in the region of interest.\nAfter following these steps to model the data, we show\nin Fig. 6 a comparison between our analytical approximations and the numerical result (Fig. 5), that represent\nvery accurately the experimental field, as determined by\nmeasurements in our laboratory. There is a reasonable\nagreement between the solid lines, representing equations\n(21) and (22) and the data points, representing the numerically calculated field. Note that, in contrast to the\nuniform finite solenoid where the power series was used\nto approximate the exact solution, here the power series\nsimply approximates our model21 function. Therefore,\nincreasing the order22 of the expansion only improves\nthe agreement with the model (fitting) function, which\nrepresents the data only over a limited region and does\nnot contain all the information about the fields in the\nproblem. This is clearly visible in Fig. 6 where good\nagreement is found only in the range z \u2248 (0.4 to 1.2) m.\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nPresent address: Instituto de F\u0131\u0301sica de S\u00e3o Carlos, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, SP 13560-970, Brazil;\nElectronic address: srmuniz@ifsc.usp.br\nD.

In cases where the\ncurrent distribution is known, but the expression for the\nfield off-axis is non-trivial (for instance, given by elliptical integrals), one can still gain some insight by using the\nmethod described here. This simple analysis follows from\na straightforward analogy with the electrostatic boundary value problem, and can be useful in determining field\ninhomogeneities in various practical experiments involving solenoids. In the present article we have used an\nexample from contemporary atomic physics experiments\nto demonstrate the method. However, we believe that\na simplified version of this discussion (e.g.: the uniform\nfinite solenoid) could be used in a regular classroom setting, as a practical example of a calculation of off-axis\nmagnetic fields, for undergraduate courses and teaching\nlaboratories in physics and engineering.\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n21\n\n22\n\nJournal of Physics 46, 582\u2013583 (1978).\nC.
