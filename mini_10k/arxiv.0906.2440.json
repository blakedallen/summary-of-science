It was found that \u03b2-Sn nanowires are\nmetastable with zero band gap against to \u03b1-diamond nanowires. The relative energy of the studied wires tends to the energy of\nthe bulk silicon crystal in \u03b2-Sn phase.\n\nSilicon nanowires (SiNW) are the most perspective elements of nanotechnology. SiNW\ncan be used in nanoelectronics as field-effect transistors, diodes, logic gates, and more. A huge\nnumber of theoretical [1]-[7] and experimental [8], [9] papers devoted to investigation of\nproperties of SiNW were published in the last years.\nThe structure and properties of silicon nanowires and nanorods under high pressure is\nalmost a virgin field. Only two papers [10], [11] devoted to this topic were published. In these\nworks a study of the silicon nanowires (SiNW) in different high-pressured phases was reported.\nIn particular, it was found that the SiNWs start to transform from initial \u03b1-diamond to \u03b2-Sn\nstructure in the range of 7.5 to 10.5 GPa [10], [11]. Despite of low activity of investigations of\nhigh pressured nanowires a plenty of experimental [12]-[15] and theoretical [16]-[19] studies of\nthe high-pressure phases of bulk silicon were carried out.\nAn existence of silicon nanowires in new phases opens a new promising field in the\nnanomaterial science due to their useful electronic properties. In particular, the silicon nanowires\nin \u03b2-Sn phase have larger bulk modulus than the bulk module of corresponding crystal [11].\nThe main goal of this paper is an ab-initio study of hydrogen-covered thin \u03b1-diamond\nSiNWs as well as \u03b2-Sn SiNWs previously discovered in experiment [10], [11]. We believe that\nSiNWs in \u03b2-Sn phase could display metallic properties like bulk \u03b2-Sn silicon. The assumption\nwas confirmed by ab initio calculations given below.\nThe electronic structure calculations of a set of silicon nanowires were carried out using\ndensity functional theory (DFT) in the framework of local density approximation [20]-[22] with\nperiodic boundary conditions using Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Program [23]-[25]. We used a\nplanewave basis set, ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials [26] and a plane-wave energy cutoff\nequal to 200 eV. To calculate the equilibrium atomic structures, the Brillouin zone was sampled\n\n\faccording to the Monkhorst\u2013Pack [27] scheme with a 0.1 \u00c5-1 k-points density grid. To avoid\ninteractions with the wire periodic image, the neighboring SiNWs were separated by 15 \u00c5 in the\ntetragonal supercells. During atomic structure minimization, structural relaxation was performed\nuntil the change in total energy was less than 10-3 eV/atom.\nAt the DFT level of theory the lattice parameter of the \u03b2-Sn phases of bulk silicon was\npredicted\n\nwith\n\nan\n\nerror\n\nof\n\n1.5%\n\n(acalc = 4.76 \u00c5\n\naexp = 4.69 \u00c5, [15]; (c a )calc = 0.550 ,\n\n(c a )exp = 0.550 \u00b1 0.002 [15], 0.554 [13]). The energy difference between the \u03b1-diamond and \u03b2-Sn\nphases of silicon is 0.22 eV/atom, which is in close agreement with previous DFT calculations of\n0.22 [16] and 0.21 eV/atom [17].\nThe atomic structures of silicon in \u03b1-diamond ( m3 m cubic unit cell) and \u03b2-Sn phases\n(4/mmm tetragonal unit cell) are presented in Fig. 1a. Different symmetries dictate the different\nnotations of the crystallographic directions of the crystals. a and b crystallographic axes of the \u03b2Sn unit cell are rotated on 45o relative to the corresponding axes of the \u03b1-diamond cell. Due to\nthis and a = b \u2260 c in the tetragonal unit cell, the equivalent 100 , 010 and 001 directions in\n\u03b1-diamond phase correspond to equivalent 110 , 1 10 and non-equivalent 001 directions in\n\u03b2-Sn phase. We studied the 110 (Fig. 1b) and 001 (Fig. 1c) oriented SiNWs truncated from\nthe bulk silicon in \u03b2-Sn phase and compared them with 100 wires of different effective sizes\ntruncated from the bulk silicon in \u03b1-diamond phase (Fig. 1d). The size of studied SiNW was\nchosen according to Ref. [9] where the nanometer-size silicon wires were produced. For\nexample, the perspective views of 110 and 001 SiNWs in \u03b2-Sn phase are presented in Fig.\n1e.\n\n\fFig. 1. a) The \u03b1-diamond and \u03b2-Sn silicon unit cells; Side and cross-section views of\nb) 110 SiNW in \u03b2-Sn phase, c) 001 SiNW in \u03b2-Sn phase and d) 100 SiNW in \u03b1-diamond\nphase; e) The perspective view of 110 and 001 SiNWs in \u03b2-Sn phase.\n\nTo study the electronic structure and energetic stability of SiNWs, the uniformly\nhydrogen-covered silicon nanowires were calculated. Hydrogen passivation prevents\nreconstruction of surface of silicon wires under the study and conserves the conducting\nproperties of the materials. For example, unpassivated 100 oriented silicon nanowires in \u03b1diamond phase reveal metallic properties, whereas hydrogen passivation restores the\nsemiconducting band gap [7].\nIt was found that in comparison with the parent crystal, the deviation of the Si-Si bond\nlengths inside both 001 and 110\n\noriented \u03b2-Sn SiNWs is less than 1.5 % with wider\n\ndistribution of the bond lengths on the wires surface. Orientation and the surface relaxation of\nthe 110 \u03b2-Sn SiNWs determine wider bond length deviation on the surface (up to 4.4 %). The\n001 oriented \u03b2-Sn wires display smaller surface relaxation with deviation of the bond lengths\n\non the surface up to 2.7 %.\n\n\fTo determine the effective size of the nanowires under study, the area of perpendicular\ncross-section of the species [2], [3] was used. Some other methods, like the determination of a\nsingle effective diameter of a nanowire as the smallest diameter taken from a perpendicular cross\nsection [4] or the smallest cylinder containing a nanowire [5], [6] are not unambiguous and\ncannot be applied to species with complex shapes and different facets. The cross-section of\nSiNW was taken as the polygonal region which was defined by the surface hydrogen atoms.\nThe 1D nature and high surface tension of the wires are expected to imply an increasing\nof the strain of the structures. The dependence of SiNWs relative energies upon the cross-section\narea is presented in Fig. 2. The nanowires relative energy is defined as energy per atom of a wire\nof given cross-section area relatively to the energy per atom of bulk silicon in \u03b1-diamond phase.\n\n2.0\n<100> \u03b1-SINW\n<110> \u03b2-SiNW\n<001> \u03b2-SiNW\n\n1.8\n\nErel, eV/atom\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n2\n\nFig. 2.

The relative energy of SiNWs in \u03b1-diamond phase is marked by filled\ncircles with solid approximating curve. The relative energy of bulk silicon in \u03b2-Sn phase is\nmarked by horizontal dashed line.\n\n\fThe dependence of nanowires relative energy upon the size can be approximated by the\npower law. The data points of the energy were fitted to Erel = A*Sc + E0 where E0 is the energy of\nthe corresponding crystal, S is the cross-section area, A and c are fitting parameters. The E0 for\nSiNWs in \u03b1-diamond phase was defined as 0 and for SiNWs in \u03b2-Sn phase as 0.22 eV/atom. The\nA and c parameters calculated using E0 values are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1 A and c parameters of approximating curves of dependences of strain energies upon\ncross-section area of the studied SiNWs.\nSiNW in \u03b1-diamond\n\nSiNW in \u03b2-Sn phase oriented in\n\nphase oriented in 100\n110\n\ndirection\n\n001\n\ndirection\n\ndirection\nA\n\n7.859\n\n5.373\n\n8.439\n\nc\n\n-0.3603\n\n-0.285\n\n-0.3483\n\nThe SiNWs in \u03b1-diamond phase are energetically favorable the SiNWs in \u03b2-Sn phase\nwith close cross-section areas. The difference of the energies of the wires in \u03b2-Sn phase of\ndifferent orientations tends to zero with increasing of the wire size.\nSiNWs in \u03b2-Sn phase display metallic properties like bulk \u03b2-Sn silicon. In the case of\nbulk \u03b2-Sn silicon obtained results agree with previously reported theoretical [18], [19] and\nexperimental [13], [14] papers. It should be mentioned that metallic nature of \u03b2-Sn SiNW and \u03b1diamond SiNW without surface passivation is different. The metallic properties of \u03b2-Sn SiNW is\ninduced by high pressure whereas metallic behavior of \u03b1-diamond SiNW without surface\npassivation is induced by the surface states.\nThe electronic band structures of the nanowires oriented in the same direction are similar.\nAlso the band structure of studied SiNWs is similar to parent crystal bands in the corresponding\ndirections. For example, the band structures of bulk silicon in \u03b2-Sn phase and 001 silicon\nnanowire in \u03b2-Sn phase with cross-section area 19 \u00c5 \u00d7 19 \u00c5 = 361.2 \u00c52 are presented in Figures\n3a and 3b, respectively.
