AD Leo produces intense, quasi-steady chromospheric and coronal\nemissions, with a 0.1\u20132.4 keV X-ray luminosity of 7\u00d71028 erg s\u22121 (H\u00fcnsch et al. 1999),\nC IV \u03bb 1548 luminosity of 9.5\u00d71026 erg s\u22121 Hawley et al. (2003) and quiescent 20 cm radio\nluminosity of 5.5\u00d71013 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 (Jackson et al. 1989). The star is also highly variable,\nproducing flares at radio, optical, UV, EUV, and X-ray wavelengths (e.g., Bastian et al.\n1990; Hawley & Pettersen 1991; Hawley et al. 2003, 1995; Favata et al. 2000).\nInvestigations of AD Leo's coronal characteristics led G\u00fcdel et al. (2003) to suggest\nthat AD Leo is constantly undergoing small-scale coronal flare events, which explains the\nlow-level variability as well as the intriguing plasma characteristics: namely, the high coronal\nelectron densities of several \u00d7 1010 cm\u22123 and a concentration of plasma at temperatures 6\u201320\nMK. Coronal densities and temperatures of this order are typically seen on the Sun during\nflares but not in quiescence. The distribution of flare frequency with energy on AD Leo is\nsteep enough that flares may account for the entire observed X-ray luminosity, making the\ndisparate nature of AD Leo's corona compared with the Sun's corona even more striking.\nRadio bursts on AD Leo have been observed for many years, beginning with a report\nby Spangler et al. (1974). Radio bursts on AD Leo are characterized by large flux density\nenhancements \u2013 as large as \u2248 500 times the quiescent flux density level of \u2248 2 mJy \u2013 that\ncan occur on very short time scales (< 0.02 seconds). The degree of circular polarization of\nthe radio bursts is typically very high, often reaching 100% (Lang et al. 1983; G\u00fcdel et al.\n1989; Bastian et al. 1990; Abada-Simon et al. 1997). The observations imply extremely large\nbrightness temperatures during radio bursts, Tb \u2265 1015 K, and suggest that one or more\ncoherent radiation mechanisms operate in the corona of AD Leo. Both plasma radiation\nmechanisms and the cyclotron maser instability have been suggested as a means of accounting\nfor the coherent radio emissions. Neither has been definitively ruled out by the observations.\nSpectroscopic investigations of the coherent radio bursts on flare stars have typically\nbeen hampered by relatively long integration times (Bastian & Bookbinder 1987; G\u00fcdel\net al. 1989) and/or limited bandwidths (e.g., Bastian et al. 1990; Abada-Simon et al. 1997).\nThe necessary combination of high time resolution and broadband frequency coverage has\nonly been available infrequently (Stepanov et al. 2001; Za\u012dtsev et al. 2004), precluding the\nmeans to measure key parameters such as the intrinsic bandwidth of the radio bursts, thereby\nhampering their interpretation.\nThe recent upgrade of the Arecibo Observatory 305 m telescope has yielded a number of\nimportant improvements that motivated us to revisit the problem of coherent radio bursts on\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nAD Leo. First, the installation of a ground screen mitigates the problem of beam spillover,\nenabling users to track targets for longer periods of time with high sensitivity. Second, due\nto more complete illumination of the 305 m primary by the Gregorian feed (illumination\narea 213 m\u00d7237 m at zenith), the sensitivity of the telescope has improved. Finally, with\nthe installation of Gregorian optics, a new broadband feed, and wideband receivers, the\ninstantaneous bandwidth accessible has improved enormously. The relative bandwidth now\naccessible to Arecibo with the L-band wide receiver is \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = 36%, ten times the relative\nbandwidth previously available at Arecibo (Bastian et al. 1990), and more than three times\nthe maximum relative bandwidths observed elsewhere (Stepanov et al. 2001; Za\u012dtsev et al.\n2004). We therefore initiated a pilot program to observe dMe flares stars with the Arecibo\n305 m telescope in June 2003, resulting in the detection of two radio bursts.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed AD Leo from 2003 June 12\u201315, during which time approximately 16 hours\nof data were collected. The observations were made using the \"L-band wide\" dual-linear feed\nand receiver, which provides frequency coverage from 1.15\u20131.73 GHz, with the Wideband\nArecibo Pulsar Processor (WAPP) backend. The WAPP was selected because it provides the\nmeans of observing a large instantaneous bandwidth with excellent spectral and temporal\nresolution. The WAPP provides four data channels, each of 100 MHz bandwidth. These\nwere deployed across the L-band wide receiver as follows: 1120\u20131220 MHz, 1320\u20131420 MHz,\n1420\u20131520 MHz, and 1520\u20131620 MHz. A gap was deliberately left between 1220\u20131320 MHz\nto avoid the strong radio frequency interference (RFI) present in this frequency range. Nevertheless, the effects of other sources of RFI could not be entirely avoided in the frequency\nbands observed. We employed a data acquisition mode where data were sampled with a time\nresolution of 10 ms; 128 spectral channels were sampled across each 100 MHz channel, yielding a spectral resolution of 0.78 MHz. All four correlation products were recorded between\nthe native-linear X and Y feed elements (XX, YY, XY, YX) with three-level sampling.\nThe beam size using the L-band wide receiver at 1.4 GHz is \u2248 3.1\u00d73.5 arcminutes in\nazimuth and zenith angle. The 1\u03c3 noise uncertainty ranges from 28\u201343 mJy per frequency\nand time bin for the different WAPPs. Interferometric measurements of AD Leo's 1.4 GHz\nflux density during periods of apparent quiescence are \u2248 2 mJy (Jackson et al. 1989), well\nbelow the confusion limit of Arecibo at the observed frequencies (\u2248 16\u201338 mJy from 1120\nMHz to 1620 MHz). Our observing strategy was to observe the target, AD Leo, for 10 minute\nscans, and then to inject a correlated calibration signal to determine antenna temperatures.\nWhile there is a bright background radio source located \u2248 2.3 arcminutes away from AD Leo\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(Seiradakis et al. 1995) and therefore within the primary beam, we utilized a \"time-switching\"\nscheme to difference times of burst activity (\"on\") and the quiescent state plus background\n(\"off\"). This procedure enabled us to estimate the antenna temperature and flux density\nthrough the use of gain curves as a function of azimuth and zenith angle.\n\n3.\n\nData Analysis and Results\n\nTwo radio bursts were identified in the WAPP data. The first radio burst occurred\nfrom approximately 22:35:20\u201323:36:30 UT on 2003 June 13 and the second occurred from\napproximately 20:05:40\u201320:06:30 UT on 2003 June 14. We now describe the observations,\ntheir analysis, and results for each event in turn.\n\n3.1.\n\nEvent on June 13\n\nFigure 1 displays the dynamic spectrum of the event June 13 in both the Stokes I (total\nflux) and V (circularly polarized flux) parameters. The radio burst is characterized by the\nfollowing general properties:\n\u2022 The burst duration is a few 10s of seconds.\n\u2022 The peak flux is \u2248 200 mJy.\n\u2022 The flux is strongly modulated in time, showing discrete features that have rise times\nof \u2248 20 ms.\n\u2022 The radio burst displays clear substructure in the time-frequency domain.\n\u2022 The radio sub-bursts are highly circularly polarized (> 90%).\nIn these respects, the properties of this radio burst are quite similar to those of strong radio\nbursts reported previously (Lang et al. 1983; G\u00fcdel et al. 1989; Bastian et al. 1990; AbadaSimon et al. 1997) in this frequency band. Indeed, noting the fast rise times of discrete\nsub-bursts, a light travel time argument implies source sizes l \u2248 c\u2206t \u223c 9 \u00d7 108 cm, or 4% of\nthe stellar radius, R\u22c6 . Using this scale as an estimate of the source size (Rs < 6000 km),\nthe observed bursts are consistent with brightness temperatures TB > 4 \u00d7 1014 K. Such large\nbrightness temperatures in AD Leo's corona require a coherent emission process.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nGiven the greatly increased bandwidth of these observations, a number of new properties\nof coherent radio bursts on AD Leo can be identified and analyzed. In particular, multitudes\nof time-resolved and spectrally-resolved structures are present in the spectrum (see Figures 2\nand 3). We note that the presence of this fine structure is incompatible with diffractive\nscintillation resulting from propagation of the signal from AD Leo to the telescope. The\nbandwidth and time scale characteristic of scintillation are expected to be of order several\nGHz and \u223c 106 sec, respectively. We therefore believe the observed fine structure is intrinsic\nto the source. We refer to these fine structures as \"sub-bursts\". The start frequency, duration, bandwidth, and drift rate of individual sub-bursts can be characterized, offering new\nconstraints on the emission mechanism responsible for the observed emission.\n\n3.1.1. Methodology\nIn order to characterize quantitatively the multitudes of fast-drift radio sub-bursts that\ncomprise this event, we employ an algorithm based on Aschwanden & Benz (1986), originally used to analyze solar radio bursts at decimeter wavelengths. We note that the discrete\nradio sub-bursts observed on AD Leo are well-resolved in frequency. Therefore, the dynamic\nspectrum was binned over 4 adjacent frequency channels to improve the signal to noise ratio\nwithout loss of spectral information. Threshold fluxes were calculated using rms flux values\nfrom \"off\" times for each WAPP data channel; a 3\u03c3 flux density threshold of \u2248 45 mJy was\napplied using the binned dynamic spectrum. Then, first and second derivatives are computed, and times when the conditions\n\n\u2202Sij /\u2202ti > 0,\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202 2 Sij /\u2202t2i < 0,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2202Si+1,j /\u2202ti+1 < 0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Sij is the flux density at time i and frequency channel j, were used to identify peaks\nin each channel. The time, frequency, and flux density of each pixel which satisfied the\nabove conditions were recorded. Individual sub-bursts were identified using an algorithm to\ngroup peaks across channels. This is an IDL procedure adapted from a photometry routine\nin the IDL Astronomy User's Library1 to group stars with non-overlapping PSF profiles into\ndistinct groups. Instead of using (x,y) as distances, the data points are (time,frequency) and\nthe distances of any given point from any other point in time and frequency are calculated\n1\n\nAvailable at http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/contents.html.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nseparately. The critical grouping describes the distances in time and frequency within which\nthe peaks must lie to be in the same group. We explored the probability space of these critical\ngrouping time and frequency values, to determine those values in which the probability of\nhaving > n peaks occurring at random was sufficiently low, \u226410\u22125 , and found that requiring\nn to be 5 and restricting tcrit \u226420 ms, \u03bdcrit \u2264 20 MHz was sufficient to meet this condition.\nUsing this procedure, we identified 313 individual sub-bursts.\nInverse drift rate, start frequency, duration, and bandwidth for the sub-bursts were\nthen determined. We filtered the data for bursts which appeared to continue beyond our\nfrequency limits, and required that the flux spectrum of the burst at a given time was\nGaussian-like, estimating the bandwidth from the FWHM of a third degree polynomial fit\nto the flux spectrum (Csillaghy & Benz 1993). The burst duration was calculated as the\nmedian FWHM of a parabolic fit to the temporal variations of all frequency channels in which\npeaks were identified. The start frequencies and inverse drift rates were calculated for subbursts which had more than one unique time peak. Out of 313 discrete events identified by\nthe above procedure, we determined bandwidth and duration for 180 sub-bursts, and inverse\ndrift rate and start frequencies for 121 sub-bursts. Figure 4 displays the distributions of\nthese four quantities.\n\n3.1.2. Rates and Durations\nThe median sub-burst duration is 0.03 seconds. The average sub-burst rate is 13 per\nsecond during the time when bursting activity is evident, with a maximum of \u2248 45 s\u22121 .\nLight curves of the bursting behavior in two different bands are illustrated in Figures 2 and\n3. A power spectrum analysis of light curves reveals no evidence for periodicities in the data,\nalthough previously reported bursts do show quasi-periodic oscillations in some cases (Lang\n& Willson 1986; Bastian et al. 1990; G\u00fcdel et al. 1989; Stepanov et al. 2001).\n\n3.1.3. Start Frequencies and Bandwidths\nThe bursts are confined to frequencies above 1350 MHz, reaching a peak just below a\nfrequency of 1500 MHz. Figure 2 shows that the sub-bursts appear to be fast-drift structures.\nSome structures drift to higher frequencies with time, while others drift to lower frequencies\nwith time.\nFigure 4 details the distribution of bandwidths. The median fractional bandwidth is\n5%, with individual bursts having measured bandwidths up to 15%. The minimum and\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nmaximum bandwidths we are able to determine with our data are \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd=1% and 36%,\nrespectively.\n\n3.1.4. Inverse Drift Rates\nFigure 4 displays the inverse drift rate distribution for events with nonzero duration;\nthe observed distribution is symmetric. The absolute value of the smallest inverse drift rates\nmeasurable with our data set arise from a combination of the minimum duration and maximum bandwidth, 0.01 s and 487 MHz, respectively, or 2\u00d710\u22125 s MHz\u22121 . A Gaussian fit to\nthe distribution, illustrated in Figure 4 has a FWHM of 4.5\u00d710\u22124 s MHz\u22121 , corresponding\nto a characteristic drift rate of 2.2 GHz s\u22121 . The distribution of inverse drift rates is incompatible with interstellar dispersion, which would be expected to have a value \u2248 \u22121.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\ns MHz\u22121 for the dispersion measure of AD Leo (\u223c0.5 pc cm\u22123 ) at these frequencies (Rybicki\n& Lightman 1979).\n\n3.2.\n\nEvent on June 14\n\nThe dynamic spectrum of the event on June 14 in Stokes I and V is displayed in Figure 5.\nWhile similar in duration to the June 13 event, it otherwise differs significantly from it. The\nJune 14 emission is characterized by a smooth variation with time rather than the spiky\nemission seen on June 13. By eye the event appears to contain sub-structure, and we\nexplored the possible existence of quasi-periodic oscillations in the data. Although there\nwere peaks in the periodograms at 0.5 and 40 Hz for each rebinned channel, these periods\nappeared in the data directly preceding and following the event as well, casting doubt on\nthe reality of finer temporal scale structures in the event.\nLight curves (Figure 6) show that the time variation of the emission has an approximately Gaussian variation. Both the duration of the emission and the time of peak flux\nevolve towards lower frequencies. The data were averaged in frequency by a factor of 10 and\nin time by a factor of 20 to ameliorate the statistics, and were then fit to a Gaussian time\nprofile in each frequency bin. Figure 7 displays the variation of the Gaussian parameters\n(center, width, peak). The peak times of the Gaussians drift with frequency at a rate of\n\u221252 MHz/s from 1120\u20131490 MHz, a drift rate that is far smaller than those characteristic of\nthe sub-bursts observed on June 13. The event apparently extends to both lower and higher\nfrequencies. The lower limit on the bandwidth of the emission is therefore \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd > 36%.\nThe duration of the event decreases with frequency. As was the case for the June 13 event,\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe degree of circular polarization is high (> 50%), but less well constrained than the June\n13 event as a result of the poorer signal to noise ratio.\nThe lack of temporal and spectral fine structures prevents us from using such features\nto constrain the source size. Presuming the source is comparable in scale to the star itself\n(lS \u2248 R\u22c6 \u2248 0.5R\u2299 ), a brightness temperature of \u2248 2 \u00d71011 K is obtained. This might suggest\nthat an incoherent emission mechanism (e.g., synchrotron radiation) is feasible. However,\nthe high degree of circular polarization indicates otherwise. We conclude that, like the June\n13 event, the June 14 event is likely due to a coherent emission mechanism. If so, the source\n\u22121/2\nscale lS may be considerably smaller than the size of the star: lS \u2248 5 \u00d7 1010 TB10 cm, where\nTB10 is the brightness temperature in units of 1010 K.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have concluded that, given the extremely high brightness temperatures and the\nhigh degree of circular polarization observed, a coherent emission mechanism or mechanisms\nis/are responsible for the radio bursts observed on AD Leo on 2003 June 13 and 14. We now\ndiscuss each event in turn.\n\n4.1.\n\nJune 13 Event\n\nIt is useful to draw parallels between the properties of the June 13 radio burst observed\non AD Leo and radio bursts observed in the solar corona, recognizing that such parallels must\nnot be given undue emphasis. A summary of different types of solar radio bursts is given\nin Table 1 of Dulk (1985). More recently, work on decimeter- wavelength and microwave\nsolar bursts has been summarized by Bastian et al. (1998). A striking feature of the June\n13 event is the presence of multitudes of fast drift sub-bursts. This might suggest that a\nphenomenon analogous to solar decimetric type III bursts (type IIIdm) or solar spike bursts\nmay be relevant.\nLike meter wavelength type III radio bursts, type IIIdm bursts are fast-drift bursts\nthat occur as a result of the nonlinear conversion of plasma waves (Langmuir\nwaves) to\np\n1/2\n2\nelectromagnetic radiation at the local electron plasma frequency \u03bdpe = e ne /\u03c0me \u2248 9ne\nkHz or its harmonic 2\u03bdpe . The Langmuir waves are believed to be excited by the passage of a\nsuprathermal electron beam propagating at a speed of \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.3c. If the beam propagates\nfrom lower (denser) to greater (more rarefied) heights in the corona, the radio emission\ndrifts from high to low frequencies. If the beam propagates from greater to lower heights,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe radio emission drifts with time in the opposite sense. In some respects, type IIIdm may\nbe regarded as the high frequency extension of classical type III radio bursts. However, for\nmetric type III bursts the vast majority drift from high to low frequencies, indicating a beam\nexciter that propagates from high to low densities in the corona. The same is not true for\ntype IIIdm bursts. In particular, the majority of type IIIdm bursts drift with frequency in\nthe opposite sense to that of metric type IIIs, indicating most are due to electron beams\npropagating from lower to higher densities.\nCloser examination of the properties of the sub-bursts determined in \u00a73.1 suggests that\nthe June 13 event bears closer resemblance to solar decimetric spike bursts. Decimetric spike\nbursts have generated interest since their discovery (Dr\u00f6ge 1977) as phenomena possibly\nclosely linked with magnetic energy release in the solar corona (Benz 1986). They differ\nfrom type III dm bursts in several critical respects. First, their instantaneous bandwidths\ntypically are an order of magnitude less than those of type IIIdm bursts. Second, their\ndurations are also roughly an order of magnitude smaller than those of type IIIdm bursts.\nIndeed, the decay times of the decimeter spike bursts may be consistent with electron-ion\ncollisional damping (G\u00fcdel & Benz 1990), unlike those of type III and type IIIdm bursts.\nThird, again in contrast to type IIIdm bursts, the degree of circular polarization of spike\nbursts tends to be high, at least for those observed on the disk of the Sun where propagation\neffects are expected to be small (G\u00fcdel & Zlobec 1991). Unlike type III or type IIIdm bursts,\nthe distribution of frequency drifts shows no strong preference for predominantly positive\nor negative drifts. A study by G\u00fcdel & Benz (1990) demonstrated that the distribution of\ninverse drift rates of solar decimetric spikes is roughly symmetric at 362 and 770 MHz. These\nwere interpreted as a nearly isotropic distribution of exciter directions within the context of\nplasma radiation.\nTo a striking degree, the June 13 event is similar in its properties to solar decimetric\nspike bursts, an exception possibly being the durations of the discrete bursts, which appear\nto be a few times longer than solar spike bursts at the same frequency, a point to which we\nreturn below. While plasma radiation produced by the nonlinear conversion of Langmuir\nwaves excited by the passage of an electron beam is the accepted emission mechanism for type\nIII and type IIIdm bursts on the Sun, the emission mechanism for decimetric spike bursts\nis more controversial. One possibility is the electron cyclotron maser (ECM) mechanism,\nwhich operates at the fundamental or harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency \u03a9Be =\neB/2\u03c0mc = 2.8B MHz when 0.3 < \u03c9pe /\u03a9Be < 1 (see, e.g., Fleishman & Melnikov 1998, for\na review). The other possibility is a plasma radiation process. Neither mechanism has been\nshown unambiguously to be the mechanism responsible for solar decimetric spike bursts.\nLikewise, neither mechanism can be firmly identified as that responsible for the spike bursts\non AD Leo although, for reasons we now outline, a plasma radiation mechanism is favored.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe primary reason we favor plasma radiation over the ECM is that in the hot, dense\ncorona of AD Leo, radiation generated by the ECM at the first or second harmonic of\n\u03a9Be can be readily gyroresonantly absorbed at the second or third harmonic layers, respectively. Although the situation may be avoided or mitigated (see Fleishman & Melnikov\n1998, and references therein) in the solar corona, the problem is exacerbated in the corona\nof AD Leo, which is significantly hotter than the Sun's. Whereas the bulk of solar X-rayemitting thermal plasma in quiescence is 1\u20132 MK, AD Leo's corona is dominated by 6\u201320\nMK soft X-ray-emitting plasma. Since the gyroresonance absorption coefficient increases as\n\u03bagr \u223c T s\u22121, where s = 2, 3 is the harmonic of the absorbing layer, the absorption is significantly greater in the corona of AD Leo than it is in the Sun's corona. In contrast to ECM\nradiation, plasma radiation is most susceptible to free-free absorption. Unlike gyroresonance\nabsorption, however, the efficacy of free-free absorption decreases with increasing plasma\ntemperature as \u03baf f \u221d T \u22123/2 . Hence, the higher temperature of AD Leo's corona favors the\nescape of radiation generated via a plasma radiation mechanism over that generated by the\nECM mechanism if \u03c9pe > \u03a9Be . For fundamental plasma radiation, this suggests B < 500 G,\na condition easily and widely met in the corona of AD Leo. Moreover, Za\u012dtsev et al. (2000)\nhave argued that plasma radiation mechanisms operate significantly more efficiently in the\nhot corona of late-type stars.\nAssuming, therefore, that the burst emission on AD Leo is due to fundamental plasma\nradiation, the symmetry of the inverse drift rate distribution implies an isotropic distribution of exciters with respect to the electron density gradients. If a given exciter is a beam\npropagating through AD Leo's corona, the drift rates imply (e.g., Benz 2002)\nd\u03bd\n\u2202\u03bd \u2202ne\n\u2202s\n=\ncos \u03c6 ,\n(4)\ndt\n\u2202ne \u2202h\n\u2202t\nwhere ne is the ambient electron density, h is the vertical height, \u2202h = \u2202s cos \u03c6, cos \u03c6 is\nthe angle between the beam direction and the vertical, and \u2202s/\u2202t = v is the propagation\nspeed. Approximating the density variation as an exponential with a scale height Hn , this\nequation can be rewritten \u03bd\u0307 \u223c \u2212(\u03bdv cos \u03c6)/(2Hn ) and so v \u223c \u22122Hn \u03bd\u0307/\u03bd cos \u03c6. Taking the\nFWHM inverse drift rate of 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 s MHz\u22121 , \u03bd\u0307 = 2.2 GHz s\u22121 , v \u223c 4Hn for \u03c6 \u2248 45\ndegrees. Constraining v to be 0.1c \u2212 0.5c suggests a scale height of order 1 \u2212 4 \u00d7 109 cm.\nThe isothermal scale height for a 10 MK plasma around a star of mass \u223c0.3 M\u2299 and radius\n\u223c0.3R\u2299 is about a factor of ten larger than this scale height, suggesting that the scale height\ndeduced from the drift rate may indicate an inhomogeneity size scale in AD Leo's corona\nwithin which the sub-burst exciters are propagating. Interestingly, if we constrain the event\nduration (\u03c4 \u223c0.03 s) to be of order the Coulomb deflection time, the temperature in the\nsource can in turn be constrained:\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n4/3\n\nT \u223c 8000\u03bd6 \u03c4 2/3 \u2248 13MK\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bd6 is the observed frequency in MHz. This value is comparable with coronal temperatures inferred from SXR observations.\n\n4.2.\n\nEvent of June 14\n\nThe second event is markedly different from the June 13 event. It is characterized by a\nsmoothly varying continuum in time and frequency. As shown in \u00a73.2, the time variation of\nthe emission at a given frequency is well-approximated by a Gaussian profile. The Gaussian\nwidth and the time of maximum progressively increase with decreasing frequency. In contrast\nto the fast-drift bursts in the June 13 event, which had characteristic drift rates of 2.2 GHz\ns\u22121 , the drift rate of the June 14 event is \u221252 MHz s\u22121 . The drift of the event could be\ndue to a disturbance propagating through AD Leo's corona. Under this interpretation, the\nobserved drift rate value of \u221252 MHz s\u22121 implies that the disturbance is propagating outward;\ntaking \u03bd = 1490 MHz for the approximate starting frequency, at coronal temperatures\n(T = 106 , 107 K), the observables constrain the propagation speed to be (1200, 1.2\u00d7104 ) km\ns\u22121 , assuming that it is fundamental plasma emission. Associating the observed frequencies\nwith fundamental plasma emission produces a constraint on the ambient electron density,\nne \u22643\u00d71010 cm\u22123 , which is consistent with measurements of cool SXR-emitting coronal\nmaterial (ne \u22643\u00d71010 cm\u22123 at T\u223c2MK; van den Besselaar et al. 2003). These speeds are\nconsistent with the Alfv\u00e9n speed in a medium with B \u2264 100 (1000) G, ne \u2264 3 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22123\nfor 1200 (1.2\u00d7104 ) km s\u22121 , respectively. The maximum duration (FWHM) is \u223c23s, which\nimplies that the extent of the atmosphere through which the disturbance propagated is 0.1\n(1) R\u22c6 , for v =1200 (1.2\u00d7104 ) km s\u22121 , respectively. Such a source size, coupled with the\nestimates of the maximum flux density, constrain the brightness temperature to be 6\u00d71011 \u2013\n6\u00d71013 K.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe have presented wideband dynamic spectra of two radio bursts observed on the dMe\nflare star AD Leo. The observed properties of the two bursts indicate that a coherent emission\nmechanism is responsible. A plasma radiation mechanism is favored. The first event, on\n2003 June 13, contained multitudes of fast-drift bursts that were similar in their properties\nto solar decimetric spike bursts. In particular, the distribution of their bandwidths, inverse\ndrift rates, and the high degree of circular polarization were qualitatively and quantitatively\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nsimilar to solar spike bursts. The distribution of durations were a factor of \u223c 3 greater than\ntheir solar analogs. The observations are consistent with the idea that the spike bursts are\ndue to fundamental plasma radiation driven by electron beam exciters. The burst durations\nare consistent with the collisional decay time. We attribute the fact that they are longerlived than their solar analogs to the greater temperature of the coronal medium on AD Leo.\nThe second event, on 2003 June 14, was different in character from the first event, being\ncharacterized by a smoothly varying continuum and frequency drift rate significantly smaller\nthan the fast-drift bursts on June 13. The emission mechanism responsible for the burst is less\ncertain, but if it is plasma radiation, the observed drift rate is consistent with a disturbance\npropagating in the stellar corona with a speed comparable to the local Alfv\u00e9n speed.\nWe conclude by pointing out that the upgrades to the Arecibo Observatory and the\nGreen Bank Telescope now open up wide regions of frequency space which can be observed\nsimultaneously at high time resolution. These advances in technology allow for dynamic\nspectrum analysis of bursting phenomena on stars using techniques used for decades on\nthe Sun. Such instrumental advances allow an investigation of plasma physics in stellar\nenvironments on the smallest spatial and temporal scales yet obtained. These investigations\nare crucial to establishing the extent to which solar phenomena can be applied in extreme\nstellar environments.\nWe thank Phil Perillat and Avinash Deshpande at NAIC for their outstanding assistance\nin making this observational program a success.

The\nwhite lines in the top panel indicate the characteristic drift rate of 2.2 GHz s\u22121 from a\nreference time and frequency point of (129.09 s, 1480 MHz), for beams directed along and\nin the opposite sense to the electron density gradient.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Distributions of inverse drift rates, start frequencies, bandwidths, and durations\ncalculated for bursts seen in the 1120\u20131620 MHz spectral region of AD Leo, during 22:35:00\u2013\n23:36:40 UT on June 13. Top left panel shows inverse drift rate distributions based on time\npeaks for events with nonzero duration and filtered for the flux spectrum shape (see text\nfor details); a Gaussian fit to the distribution has a FWHM of 4.5\u00d710\u22124 s/MHz. The top\nright panel displays distribution of start frequencies; this confirms that most of the subbursts occur at frequencies higher than \u22481350 MHz. Bottom left panel displays bandwidth\ndistribution and bottom right panel display distribution of durations for events, subject to a\nfilter; see text for details. The median bandwidth is 5% and the median duration is 0.03 s.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Dynamic spectrum of slowly drifting behavior seen on AD Leo with the Arecibo\nObservatory. Frequency increases down and time increases to the right. Frequency coverage\nextends from 1120\u20131220 MHz, 1320\u20131589 MHz; gaps are due to RFI excision or poor bandpass response. (a) Dynamic spectrum of total intensity variations. (b) Dynamic spectrum\nof circular polarization variations.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Light curves of event on June 14 at four different frequency ranges. Data have been\nbinned by a factor of 10 in frequency and 20 in time. The data dropout at \u223c129 seconds at\nall frequencies is due to the appearance of a periodic radar signal causing RFI; this data has\nbeen discarded. This event is characterized by a smooth, Gaussian-like modulation and the\ndrift to lower frequencies at later times is evident.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Variation of Gaussian parameters during event on 14 June 2003. Top left panel\nshows the central time of the Gaussian fit for each frequency bin; the linear fit to \u03bd \u2264 1490\nMHz is \u221252 MHz s\u22121 . Numbers indicate times at which flux spectra are illustrated in\nbottom right panel. Dashed vertical and horizontal lines indicate the approximate time\nand frequency, respectively, of the burst start. Top right panel shows increase of Gaussian\nFWHM with time; the slope of the linear fit is 1.2 FWHM (s) s\u22121 . The vertical dashed line\nindicates the approximate time at which the burst started, as deduced from the upper left\npanel. Bottom left panel displays increase of burst duration towards smaller frequencies; the\nsolid line is a second degree polynomial fit to the data. The vertical dashed line indicates\nthe approximate frequency at which the burst started. Bottom right panel displays the flux\nversus frequency at several points during the burst; numbers refer to times denoted in top\nleft panel.\n\n\f"}
