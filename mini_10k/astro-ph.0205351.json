(1993) and Kim, Goobar and Perlmutter (1996) (hereafter H93 and KGP96)\nthe K-corrections for samples of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were presented at both low- and\nhigh-redshift respectively. In H93 they dealt explicitly with the standard single filter K-corrections\n(KBB and KV V ). KGP96 developed the \"cross-filter\" K-corrections (KBR and KV R ) necessary\nfor the determination of the cosmological parameters from high-redshift SNe Ia. Cross-filter Kcorrections are necessary in the high-redshift searches since it allows one to work with the rest-frame\noptical light (where we have a good understanding of SNe Ia) and search photometrically where\nthe observed light from a redshifted SN Ia is the brightest. Unlike the traditional single-filter Kcorrection only a small amount of extrapolation over a given spectrum is necessary. The only cost\nincurred by using cross-filter K-corrections is the small uncertainty in the zero points of the filter\nsystem. Figure 1 shows both an ideal case (at z = 0.47) where the B- and V -band filters nicely\nmatch the de-redshifted R- and I-band filters (and the cross-filter K-corrections are insensitive to\nthe underlying spectrum) and a less desirable one (at z = 0.65) which involves some extrapolation\nor interpolation.\nThe dominant problem in applying K-corrections on real data is that one rarely has both photometric and spectroscopic observations of the same supernova at the same phase of its evolution.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nAs a result, we are obligated to resort to existing libraries of supernova spectra from which we are\nto draw an appropriate K-correction for the photometric measurement in question. The spectra\nand time-series evolution of SNe Ia are remarkably homogeneous (Filippenko 1997) but differences\ndo exist (Nugent et al. 1995; Branch, Fisher & Nugent 1993) which are undoubtedly linked to the\nvariety of SN Ia light-curve shapes and possible foreground extinction.\nThe purpose of this paper is to further the work in KGP96 by synthesizing our current understanding of the spectra and light curves of SNe Ia to provide the best possible method for\ndetermining their K-corrections along with their associated errors. In particular we wish to focus\non the effects that light-curve shape and reddening have on the K-corrections. One should note\nthat the method presented here was developed and used for the analysis of the 42 high-redshift\nsupernovae by the Supernova Cosmology Project (in Perlmutter et al. (1999), hereafter SCP99);\nit was also shared in advance of publication with the High-Z Supernova Search Team (HZSST)\nfor their analysis of 14 additional high-redshift supernovae (Riess et al. 1998a) and it was briefly\ndiscussed in \u00a7 5 of Gilliland, Nugent & Phillips (1999).\n\n2.\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe magnitude of a SN Ia in filter y can be expressed as the sum of its absolute magnitude\nMx , cross-filter K-correction Kxy , distance modulus \u03bc and extinction due to dust in both the host\ngalaxy, Ax , and our galaxy, Ay .\nmy (t(1 + z)) = Mx (t, s) + Kxy (z, t, s, Ax , Ax )\n+\u03bc(z, \u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b , Ho ) + Ax (t) + Ay (t).\n\n(1)\n\nHere t refers to the epoch when the SN Ia is being observed, s is the stretch-factor [as described in\nPerlmutter et al. (1997), hereafter SCP97] and z is the redshift. The stretch-factor, s, simultaneously parameterizes three aspects of the SN Ia light curve. First, it is responsible for changing the\nshape of the light curve. From an s = 1 template, which is similar to the Leibundgut template for\nSNe Ia (Leibundgut 1988), almost all known light curves for SNe Ia can be reproduced surprisingly\nwell from the U -band through the V -band (over the time range \u221220 . t \u2212 t0 . +40) by stretching\nthe time axis of the light curve about maximum light by the factor s. This fact is highlighted in\nFigure 2 where we can see the large reduction in photometric scatter after the application of the\nstretch correction (see Goldhaber et al. (2001) for a quantitative study of this B-band stretch-factor\nfit). For the set of nearby supernovae in Figure 2 the peak-to-peak scatter for all photometric bands\nabout a s = 1 template decreases by a factor of 3 and 2 for +15 and +40 days after maximum\nlight respectively after the stretch correction is applied to the data. Second, a relationship exists\nbetween the peak magnitude in B for a SN Ia and s that can be expressed as follows (SCP99):\nMB (t = 0, s) = MB (t = 0, s = 1) \u2212 \u03b1 \u2217 (s \u2212 1).\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThis is very similar to the relationship found by Phillips (1993) where a correlation between the\npeak brightness and the decline of the light curve from maximum light to +15 days (\u2206m15 (B)) was\npresented. The broader light curves (smaller \u2206m15 (B)) are intrinsically brighter, and the narrower\nlight curves (larger \u2206m15 (B)) are intrinsically fainter. Finally, there is a relationship between the\ncolor of SNe Ia and s at peak B brightness which can be expressed as follows:\nB \u2212 V (t = 0) = \u2212\u03b2 \u2217 (s \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03b3.\n\n(3)\n\nThis equation shows that the broader, brighter SNe are slightly bluer as well. (Note that the best\nfit values for the constants in Eqn's 2 & 3 and their uncertainties can be found in SCP99. See also\nPhillips et al. (1999) for similar relationships with respect to \u2206m15 (B).)\nThe cross-filter K-corrections presented in this paper were calculated as they were in KGP96:\n\u0012R\n\u0013\n\u03bbZ(\u03bb)Sx (\u03bb)d\u03bb\ncounts\n= \u22122.5 log R\nKxy\n+ 2.5 log(1 + z)\n\u03bbZ(\u03bb)Sy (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nR\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bbF (\u03bb)Sx (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nR\n+2.5 log\n.\n(4)\n\u03bbF (\u03bb/(1 + z))Sy (\u03bb))d\u03bb\n\nHere F (\u03bb) is the spectral energy distribution (SED) at the source (in this case a supernova), Sx (\u03bb)\nand Sy (\u03bb) are the effective transmission of the x and y-bands and Z(\u03bb) is an idealized local stellar\nspectral energy distribution for which U = B = V = R = I = 0 in the photometric system used\nhere. Kxy is defined as in Eq. 1. We have calculated the K-corrections as integrals of photon\ncounts since here we have assumed a count-based photometric system. For a full description of why\na count-based system is prefered see the appendix.\nAs can be seen in Eq. 1 the K-corrections are dependent on anything which affects the observed\nspectrum. This not only includes the obvious effects of redshift, z, and the spectral epoch, t, but the\neffects of stretch, s, and extinction, AX and AY , as well.1 As pointed out in Nugent et al. (1995)\nindividual spectral features also vary slightly as a function of stretch in addition to the overall\nchange in the broad slope of the SED mentioned above. Thus ideally what we need is a set of\ntemplate SNe Ia spectra that cover a wide range in stretch, time and wavelength. Unfortunately at\nthis time such a set of spectra is not available. However, as we will show, a very good approximation\ncan be made that nicely accounts for almost all the spectroscopic differences among SNe Ia in order\nto accurately reproduce their K-corrections.\n\n3.\n\nThe Recipe\n\nWe would like to develop a simple yet effective method for determining K-corrections that encompasses the effects of stretch and extinction, overcomes gaps in existing spectroscopic data sam1\n\nNote that a further complication, not considered in this paper, would be for extinction along the line of sight\nthat occurred neither in our galaxy nor in the host galaxy of the supernova.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nples, and quantifies the uncertainties. H93 noted the following characteristic of the K-corrections\nfor SNe Ia. \"One of the most interesting features of this family of curves is their resemblance with\nthe B \u2212V color curve of Ne Ia, implying that the K term is basically driven by the color of the SN.\"\nIn Figure 3 we present the K-corrections for a typical, s = 1.0, SN Ia at a variety of redshifts along\nwith its B \u2212 V color curve. The similarity of these curves is striking and for very good reason. It\nis the overall shape of the SED, i.e. the broad color differences rather than the individual spectral\nline features, which more than any other factor, determines the K-correction. In this paper we\nrefer to these \"overall SED colors\" to describe the SED shape averaged over \u223c1000\u00c5 bins.\nGiven this behavior we propose the following recipe for determining the K-corrections for a\nSN Ia.\n1. Create a single template spectral grid of flux as a function of wavelength and time for a\ns \u2248 1.0 SN Ia using all available \"Branch Normal\" SNe Ia (Branch, Fisher & Nugent 1993).\n2. Flux calibrate the spectra in the grid so that they yield as a function of time the standard\nrelative magnitudes (in U BV RIJHK) of a s = 1.0 SN Ia.\n3. Adjust the overall SED colors for each time step of the grid to account for (a) extinction\nbased on a given supernova's measured EB\u2212V and (b) the color differences as a function\nof the measured stretch factor of a given supernova. Both of these color adjustments are\nperformed using a slope correction that follows the Cardelli et al. (1989) reddening law; as\nexplained below, the stretch color differences have a very similar wavelength dependence.\n4. For a given SN Ia measured properties (s, z, EB\u2212V ) calculate the K-correction for each date,\nt, using integrals over the color-adjusted grid as in Eq. 4.\n5. Propagate uncertainties in s, z, EB\u2212V , t and in the constants of Eq 3 to estimate the Kcorrection uncertainties.\n\n4.\n\nTesting the Method\n\nGiven the recipe outlined above we are now in a position to test the validity of calculating Kcorrections from a single template of time evolving spectra, where the SED of any given spectrum\ncan be altered to match the differences in stretch and/or extinction. Furthermore, we need to test\nthe effects of interpolation in time between samples of observed spectra. While the database of\nSNe Ia has grown considerably in the past few years, there are very few spectra at a given epoch\nfor a given supernova that go from the UV through IR. Additionally, for a given supernova, there\nare often large gaps in the spectral sequence, brought about by the supernova going behind the\nsun, a full moon or lack of continuing access to telescope time.\nWe have made a couple of hypotheses here that we must test. Do different SNe Ia (s, E(B \u2212V ))\nat the same epoch have the same K-correction after a color-adjustment on the overall SED color\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nis applied (step 3 above)? We test this by examining the K-corrections for two very different\nSNe Ia 1992A and 1991T. The stretch values for these supernovae are nearly at opposite ends of\nthe observed range, 0.80 and 1.09, and their reddening corrected B \u2212 V colors at maximum light\nwere -0.01 and -0.07 respectively (SN 1991T suffered from an extinction of E(B \u2212 V ) \u2248 0.2). In\nFigure 4a we see KBR at z = 0.35 for both these supernovae and we note differences of at least\n0.1 to 0.2 mag. over this time range. We chose this redshift, which involves a fair amount of\nextrapolation between the rest-frame B-band and de-redshifted R-band filters, to highlight the\ndifferences between the two SNe. In Figure 4b we have applied a slope correction to each of the\nsupernova's spectra so that they have the same B \u2212 V colors as an s = 1.0 SN Ia at every epoch.\nThe slope correction was performed by altering the flux using the reddening law of Cardelli et al.\n(1989) (either making them bluer or redder accordingly). This is a reasonable approach since, while\nnot exact, van den Bergh (1995), Riess et al. (1996) and Tripp & Branch (1999) have noticed that\nthe intrinsic relationship between MV and B \u2212 V for SNe Ia of varying stretch is quite similar to\nthat of a typical dust reddening law. The result of these \"color corrections\" to the spectra is that\nthe K-corrections now lie on top of each other with differences between the curves of at most 0.02\nmag. It is well known that these particular supernovae show several differences spectroscopically\n(e.g. see Nugent et al. (1995) and Branch, Fisher & Nugent (1993)), however, for the K-corrections\nthese differences are quite small compared to the effect of the overall SED colors.\nWe do note the following exception to this method. SN 1991bg, a peculiar, sub-luminous SN Ia\n(with s < 0.7), has a large trough in its spectra due to several strong Ti II spectral lines (Filippenko\net al. 1992). This feature is over 400\u00c5 wide and persists quite strongly for several months. The\ncolor difference between a s = 1.0 SN Ia and a 91bg-like supernovae at maximum light is > 0.8 in\nB \u2212 V , and is due almost completely to the presence of these Ti II lines. The \"color correction\"\nmethod mentioned above will not work with these types of SNe Ia. Instead, one would have to\ncreate a set of template spectra based solely on 91bg-like supernovae.\nHow well do the temporal interpolations work? Since we see that it is the overall SED colors\nwhich are the largest factors in the K-correction, and not individual spectral features, we have\nsome confidence in interpolating between different supernovae across a wide range of epochs. A\ntest of this method is seen in Figure 5. Here we once again display KBR for a z = 0.35 SN Ia with\ns = 1.0 along with three other sets of K-corrections, chosen to mimic the effect of mis-identifying\nthe date of a spectrum or poorly interpolating between dates. These K-corrections were calculated\nby forcing the spectra within 10 days of a given point on the light curve to have the same colors as\nthe SN Ia has at that central point. This was done for maximum light, +10 days and +20 days.\nThe difference in the K-corrections is, at most, 0.05 mag over the entire 20 day window and .\n0.02 mag. for a 10 day window. Thus the spectral feature evolution of a SN Ia has a negligible\ncontribution to the change in the K-correction over periods of roughly one week compared to the\nchanges in the overall SED colors. This also gives us confidence in interpolating between spectra\nof slightly separated epochs, so long as the overall SED colors are correct.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n5.\n\nSN Ia Template\n\nTable 1 lists the SNe Ia used to construct the template. In Table 2 we list the U BV RIJHK\nmagnitudes used to determine the overall SED colors for this s = 1.0 SN Ia template. Note that this\nis a preliminary template and will certainly change in the future as more and better observations of\nSNe Ia are obtained. The preliminary nature of this template has no effect on the results presented\nin this paper, since our goal here is to stress the method rather than the actual values for the Kcorrections. The color template was created from four primary sources. The B- and V -band light\ncurves come from the data of Riess et al. (1999a) and the R, I light curves from Knop (2002) (see\nalso Goldhaber et al. (2001) for comparable B-band templates). . The JHK photometry comes\nfrom the work of Elias et al. (1981) and the U -band data from the work in Branch et al. (1997).\nThe early, rising, portion of the light curve, which is well mapped out in B and V prior to -10 days,\nwas extrapolated in all other filters in a smooth way such that the explosion date for this SN Ia\noccurs 20 days before maximum light in B.\nThe set of observed spectra was assembled in a two dimensional grid of flux as a function of time\n(1 day bins with \u221219 < t < 70) and wavelength (10 \u00c5 bins with 2500 \u00c5 < \u03bb < 25000 \u00c5). If two or\nmore spectra on a given day overlapped we used their noise-weighted average. All the spectra were\nthen \"color corrected\" by the method outlined above to have the colors listed in Table 2. To fill in\nthe temporal gaps, a simple linear interpolation was applied throughout the set. Extrapolation was\nonly used prior to day \u221214 and just for the UV after day +45. The entire set was then smoothed\nin a given wavelength bin, using a gaussian-weighted boxcar approach, over time (a \u03c3 = 2 days was\nused). This removed any \"glitches\" (such as poor cosmic-ray subtractions, etc.) from the overall\ntemplate. Finally a last \"color correction\" was applied to this grid of spectra.2 In Figure 6 we\npresent a sampling of the template from two weeks before to four weeks after maximum light.\n\n6.\n\nError Budget\n\nWe now turn our attention to the error associated with making a given K-correction. We have\nalready considered the first component of this error in \u00a7 4. This is the error incurred when using\nthe template method and is a result of the effectiveness of the \"color correction\" across the SN Ia\nsub-type and the interpolation in time of the spectra. In the worst-case-scenario for rest-frame\noptical cross-filter K-corrections (z \u2248 0.35) there is < 1% rms dispersion over the entire light curve\ndue to differences in supernova sub-type, and < 1% dispersion due to interpolations in time of the\nspectra, when constrained to \u00b1 4 days.\nThe second component of the error is purely observational and depends on two factors: (1) the\n2\n\nNote that since there is so little spectroscopy available for \u03bb > 10000 \u00c5 for SNe Ia we just assumed monotonically\ndecreasing fluxes as a function of wavelength in these regions which reproduced the photometry. We included this\nregion of the spectrum purely for convenience in preparation of future work on bolometric light curves.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nalignment of the de-redshifted filter (on which the K-correction will be performed) with respect to\nthe rest-frame filter and (2) the photometric error on the observed color of the supernova. This\noverall observational error vanishes for either perfectly matched filters or zero error in the color\nmeasurement.\nTo illustrate this error we present in Figure 7 KBR as a function of z. Here we have calculated\nthis K-correction for three different cases in which we assign an uncertainty in R \u2212 I of 0.02, 0.05\nand 0.10. The most striking fact about this graph is how the uncertainty in KBR vanishes at\nz = 0.49, where the rest-frame B and de-redshifted R-band filters nicely overlap, regardless of the\nuncertainty in the color measurement. One also notices how the uncertainty in the K-correction\nflares out at the upper and lower ranges in redshift. In practice, when trying to obtain rest-frame\ncorrected B-band photometry, KBR is not used for SNe Ia with z . 0.3 or z & 0.7. A switch is\nmade to KBV or KBI , respectively, to perform the K-correction. At these redshifts, where the\nrest-frame B and de-redshifted R-band filters barely overlap, the uncertainty in the observed color\nof the supernova translates directly into a larger uncertainty in the K-correction. For example, at\nz = 0.3 we note that \u03c3KBR \u2248 \u03c3B\u2212V . While this may seem like it would impart a large uncertainty\nin the corrected B-band magnitude it is in fact dwarfed by the error in the extinction correction.\nGiven that AB = 4.1E(B \u2212 V ) we see the fact that \u03c3AB is a factor of four larger than the \u03c3KBR .\nThus the major problem facing individual high-redshift SN Ia photometry will always lie in the\naccuracy of multi-color photometry, not in performing K-corrections.\n\n6.1.\n\nProblems with Restframe U -band Photometry\n\nAs automated searches for supernovae continue to progress, one of the greatest problems faced\nin the reduction of this data concerns our knowledge of the rest-frame UV light. Many problems\nexist with current U -band photometry from an observational standpoint alone (Richmond et al.\n1995). When this is coupled with the large intrinsic variations among similar SNe Ia in the UV\n(Branch et al. 1997) and the larger uncertainties in absolute UV photometry due to extinction,\none can easily see that that working in this area of the spectrum is problematic at best. Here we\nprovide two examples of how the above stated problems affect our current understanding of SNe Ia.\nThe highest redshift SNe Ia that have been confirmed spectroscopically are SN 1998eq (Aldering\net al. 1998) at a z = 1.20 and SN 1999fv (Coil et al. 2000) at a z = 1.19\u00b10.02. Both supernovae were\ndiscovered in the I-band. The SCP was able to follow SN 1998eq in the J-band with NICMOS\non board the HST while the HZSST obtained a deep image of SN 1999fv in the J-band from\nthe ground (Tonry 2000). Both teams will rely on the I-band photometry of the supernovae to\ndetermine the shape of its light curve (the I-band maps almost directly with the rest-frame U -band\nat these redshifts) and use the J-band photometry to infer the peak rest-frame B-band magnitude.\nHowever, current uncertainties in the intrinsic U \u2212 B colors of SNe Ia are quite large. A s = 1.0\nSNe Ia has \u03c3U \u2212B \u2265 0.1 which implies an uncertainty in AB \u2265 0.5 (AB = 4.8EU \u2212B ) (Branch\net al. 1997; Perlmutter et al. 1998). Without any other constraints on the total reddening these\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nsupernovae become quite ineffective in discriminating between various cosmological models.\nNot only does our current understanding of the UV affect our interpretation of the very highredshift SNe Ia, but it affects our knowledge of nearby supernova and therefore our current understanding of the relationship between light-curve shape and peak brightness as well. In Table 3 we\npresent the differences between SN 1992A and SN 1994D in their rest-frame U \u2212 B and B \u2212 V\ncolors and in KBB if these SNe Ia were found at a redshift of z = 0.1. These two SNe Ia have very\nsimilar stretches (s \u2248 0.81) but very different colors in the blue as is seen quite clearly in Figure 4\nof Patat et al. (1996). Table 3 highlights how these differences lead to very different K-corrections\nas a function of time. Depending on the sampling, a SN Ia observed at this redshift whose Kcorrection did not account for color differences in the UV could yield reduced B-band light-curve\nshapes which are incorrect by >10%. This difference would create a 0.17 magnitude offset in the\ndistance modulus (see Eq. 2). SNe Ia at this redshift are particularly important for the Hubble\ndiagram since they are well out in the Hubble flow and thus unaffected by host galaxy peculiar\nvelocities. One possible explanation of the difference in the UV color can be found in the work of\nH\u00f6flich et al. (1998) where the metallicity of the progenitor can have a strong influence on the UV\nspectrum. Lentz et al. (2000) has quantified these effects by varying the metallicity in the unburned\nlayers and computing their resultant spectra at maximum light with the spectrum synthesis code\nPHOENIX (Nugent et al. 1997; Nugent 1997). The differences seen in the theoretical calculations\neasily span the range seen between SNe 1994D and 1992A and are quite plausible as an explanation\nfor the large intrinsic scatter in the UV for SNe Ia given the range in progenitor environments for\nthese objects (Hamuy et al. 2000).\nWe conclude this section with a final note on how the intrinsic differences in the U -band\nphotometry can affect a bias on the high-redshift search for SNe Ia. Given the differences seen\nin the U \u2212 B colors for the two SNe Ia above, we can perform a simple Monte-Carlo search for\nsupernovae along the lines of Gilliland, Nugent & Phillips (1999), to estimate the likelihood of\nfinding the bluer SN 1994D's over the redder SN 1992A's. In Figures 8, 9 and 10 we have plotted\nthe discovery rate for a search with a 50-50 split between supernovae like 1994D and those like\n1992A. In the R-band search we have modeled the Monte Carlo after a typical 4-m telescope run\nlike those carried out by the SCP (SCP99) and HZSST (Riess et al. 1998a) between 1995 and 1998.\nThe search covers 4 square degrees with a 28 day separation between the reference and discovery\nimages and has limiting magnitudes, typical for those searches, of 23.0, 23.5 and 24.0. What is\nclearly seen from the figures is the strong bias above a redshift of 0.5 (where the restframe U -band\nlight slips into the R-band filter) for discovering blue SNe Ia. Of the SNe Ia presented in the\naforementioned papers over 33% are at z > 0.5 and thus susceptible to this bias. More recently the\nsearches conducted by both teams have been carried out in the I-band with the goal of discovering\neven higher redshift supernovae. For this Monte Carlo we assumed a search gap of 28 days and 1\nsquare degree to limiting magnitudes of 24.0, 24.5 and 25.0. Going to the redder filter we see the\nbias affecting the search for z > 0.9.\nHow would such an effect alter the measurement of the cosmological parameters? First one\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nwould have to know the relative rates of 94D-like to 92A-like supernovae at any given redshift\nwhich is completely uncertain at the moment. However, even assuming an equal distribution of the\nrate of both populations, on face value there would be little difference. Both SN 1992A and SN\n1994D appear to have similar absolute peak brightnesses in the restframe B-band given the intrinsic\nuncertainties in the SN Ia calibration and the distances to their host galaxies (Ajhar et al. 2001).\nThe major difference would lie in color corrections based on the uncertainties in the K-corrections\nfor those supernovae at redshifts where the restframe U -band light contaminates the correction to\nthe B-band measurement. Given a split distribution and the Monte Carlo simulations above we\nwould expect to find, on average, bluer supernovae at higher redshift and potentially underestimate\nthe correction due to host galaxy extinction. This would lead one to overestimate distances to these\nobjects.\nHowever, in general, this effect is quite limited. This is due to the fact that the total amount\nof reddening a supernovae can have which is discovered near the edge of detection is quite small.\nThis is further amplified by the fact that since one is looking at the rest-frame UV light, which\nsuffers a higher relative extinction, even less reddening is allowed before the supernova becomes too\nextinguished to discover. Even for those 94D-like supernovae with a small amount of extinction\nthat still get discovered, the effect of under-correcting for extinction, and thus overestimating the\ndistance to those supernovae, is compensated by the fact that these supernovae are brighter in the\nUV and the flux in the observed filter is higher than average.\nIn practice, as was reported in Knop (2002), one can use both the 94D-like templates and the\n92A-like templates to compute the K-corrections for the high redshift supernovae. The differences\nin the overall fits to the cosmological parameters are quite small, though one definitely produces\nsystematic differences in the color distributions of the high-redshift supernovae based on the choice\nof template. The simple solution to this problem is to observe the high-redshift SNe Ia farther\ninto the red where the restframe U -band light does not play a significant role in determining the\ncorrected B-band magnitude.\n\n6.2.\n\nProblems with Restframe I-band Photometry\n\nOne of the interesting characteristics of SNe Ia is the shape of the light curves in the near IR. In\nthe I-band there exists a secondary peak which occurs more strongly, and at a slightly later epoch,\nfor the more luminous supernovae while less luminous SNe Ia like SN 1991bg hardly show this\nsecondary peak at all (e.g. see Hamuy et al. (1996); Riess et al. (1999b); Krisciunas et al. (2001)).\nThis feature in the I-band light curves is in part due to the presence of the strong emission from\nthe Ca II IR triplet. The emission is delayed in the brighter supernovae and is much stronger when\nit peaks compared to the fainter supernovae.\nIn the restframe, the I-band straddles this P-Cygni profile which is almost 1000 \u00c5 wide as\nseen in Figure 11. Even for low-z supernovae this feature poses a problem. At a redshift of just\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\na few percent (z \u2248 0.05) the I-band filter moves completely off the emission feature. Thus Kcorrections which are based on the template method outlined above which can not compensate for\nthe change in this feature's strength due to epoch and luminosity-class can be in significant error.\nIn Strolger et al. (2002) differences approaching 0.3 magnitudes were seen using various template\nmethods compared to using the actual supernovae spectra to perform the K-correction. Clearly the\nsolution to this problem is to derive separate templates based on luminosity class for performing\nthe K-corrections. This is exactly the same type of problem mentioned before in the B-band for\nthe low-luminosity SNe Ia due to the presence of the Ti II trough.\n\n7.\n\nReddening\n\nWe now turn our attention to the effects of reddening on the light curves of SNe Ia. There are\ntwo factors we must consider here. First, as pointed out by KGP96, the observed color excess of a\nSN Ia will vary slightly with time because the rapidly varying SED shifts the effective wavelength\nof each filter. Second, Phillips et al. (1999) (hereafter P99) have noted that the observed decline\nrate of a SN Ia is a weak function of the dust extinction which affects the light curves. Both of\nthese effects directly impact one's ability to accurately measure the light-curve shape and peak\ncorrected-magnitude of a SN Ia.\nWe start with a few definitions. E(B \u2212 V )true is a measure of the absorbing gas and dust along\nthe line of sight to the supernova, not the observed color excess, E(B \u2212 V )obs , which will vary with\nsupernova epoch and total extinction. In Figure 12 we have plotted the relative variations of\nRX = AX /E(B \u2212 V )\n\n(5)\n\nas a function of time. The calculations were performed for B, R and I (V = RB \u2212 1.0 by definition\nand thus is not shown) using the spectral template of \u00a7 5. We display both RBobs and RBtrue .\nEach serves a purpose for performing color corrections depending on whether one wants to correct\nphotometry based on their observed colors, or if one a priori knows E(B \u2212 V )true along the line\nof sight to the SN Ia in question. Over the first 40 days of the light curve RB is found to vary\nconsiderably, \u22120.1 . RB . 0.4. The variation is caused by the rapid evolution in the spectra of\nSNe Ia around maximum light noted by the change in \u03bbef f as mentioned above.\nP99 found the following relationship between the true decline rate and the observed decline\nrate as a function of E(B \u2212 V )true .\n\u2206m15 (B)true \u2243 \u2206m15 (B)obs + 0.1E(B \u2212 V )true\n\n(6)\n\nThis shows that from peak to +15 days the light curves of SNe Ia get broader as they become\nmore extinguished by dust. In Figure 13 we plot the relative difference in B-band magnitude\n(normalized at maximum light) between an unextinguished light curve and several increasingly\nextinguished light curves. These curves were calculated using the spectral template from \u00a7 5 and\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe same reddening law employed by P99 (Cardelli et al. 1989). Here one can clearly see the result\nfound by P99, however, the pre-maximum portion of the light curve does not behave in a similar\nway. Our results show that extinguished light curves are narrower prior to maximum light and\nbroader past maximum light. The explanation for this result is quite simple. For a given epoch,\na reddened spectrum produces a shift in the effective wavelength, \u03bbef f , of the spectrum, F (\u03bb),\nintegrated through the filter, S(\u03bb), toward the red. \u03bbef f is given by the following equation:\nR\n\u03bbF (\u03bb)S(\u03bb)d\u03bb\n.\n(7)\n\u03bbef f = R\nF (\u03bb)S(\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\nIn Figure 14 we have plotted \u03bbef f as a function of time for various levels of extinction in the Bband. We note that a supernova naturally becomes cooler and redder as a function of time after\nmaximum light and for a given amount of extinction there is also the expected shift in the effective\nwavelength. Thus a simple minded explanation for the change in a heavily reddened SN Ia's B-band\nlight curve is that the shift in effective wavelength makes the light curve act more like a V -band\nlight curve, which is broader after maximum light but narrower prior to it (see Table 2). Therefore,\nit would be incorrect to interpret the equation in P99 as something which is applied to a given\n\u2206m15 (B)light-curve class. Rather it should only be used in the strict interpretation of \u2206m15 (B),\nthe change in magnitude from peak to +15 days.\n\n8.\n\nExamples of Extinction and K-correctionson Observed Data\n\nIn this section we look at the application of the template method with regards to both reddening\ncorrections on three nearby SNe Ia and K-corrections on one of the SCP's first set of seven highredshift supernovae.\n\n8.1.\n\nSNe 1998bu, 1986G and 1996ai\n\nSNe 1998bu (Suntzeff et al. 1999; Jha et al. 1999), 1986G (Phillips et al. 1987) and 1996ai (Riess\net al. 1999b) were three well observed SNe Ia caught prior to maximum light and followed regularly\nfor over two months in multiple filters. All three suffered from a large amount of extinction: SN\n1998bu had E(B \u2212V ) \u2248 0.37, SN 1986G had E(B \u2212V ) \u2248 0.6 and SN 1996ai had E(B \u2212V ) \u2248 1.68.3\nAs outlined in the previous section, the biggest effect that the reddening has on a SN Ia\n(outside of the obvious color change) is its ability to alter the observed stretch of the light curve.\nFor these three SNe the B-band stretch should be decreased from the observed values by the\n3\n\nHere the values for the extinction were determined via a fitting method which incorporates the spectral template\nmentioned in \u00a7 5. Within their corresponding uncertainties, they agree with the values published in the photometry\npapers mentioned above.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nfollowing amounts: SN 1998bu \u2013 3%, SN 1986G \u2013 5% and SN 1996ai \u2013 11%. Eq. 2 implies that\nwithout performing the aforementioned correction to the stretch due to the extinction along the\nline of sight to the supernovae their distance moduli would be overestimated by 0.05, 0.09 and 0.19\nmag respectively.\nA secondary effect one needs to consider is that a given stretch implies a particular B \u2212 V color\nevolution for the supernova. If one used the peak observed B \u2212 V color of these supernovae coupled\nwith their observed B-band stretch they would falsely arrive at a higher value of EB\u2212V for each.\nThis is simply due to the fact that the observed B-band stretch of an extinguished SN Ia is broader\nthan its true, intrinsic stretch and a narrower stretch SN Ia is redder than a broader one. Therefore\nusing the stretch corrections to the extinguished SNe above coupled with Eq. 3 we see that the\ntrue value of AB would be altered by the following amounts: SN 1998bu \u2013 0.02, SN 1986G \u2013 0.04\nand SN 1996ai \u2013 0.09 mag. This goes in the opposite direction of the corrections outlined above\nand thus slightly mitigates the overall effect that reddening has on the distance determinations\nto SNe Ia. However ignoring this effect increases the overall dispersion in the stretch luminosity\nrelationship.\n\n8.2.\n\nSN 1994H\n\nAs seen in SCP99, SN 1994H (one of the first seven supernovae published in SCP97) was one\nof two large outliers in the Hubble diagram of the SCP's high-redshift SNe Ia. It was also one\nof the few supernovae without a spectrum to confirm its classification and it was excluded from\nall of the primary fits of SCP99. Using a brute-force multi-dimensional \u03c72 fitting program which\nincorporates the template in \u00a7 5, we have calculated the best fit to the light curve of this supernova\n(a modified version of this method was used in SCP99. From this we find the best fit stretch to\nbe s = 0.90 \u00b1 0.06. The supernova had an observed color which was bluer than B \u2212 R = 0.7 at\n0.0\u00b10.6 days at the 95% confidence limit. A SN Ia at this redshift (z = 0.374) and stretch will\nhave an unextinguished B \u2212 R color of 1.63\u00b10.05 (the error bars are the result of the uncertainties\nin the time of maximum light and stretch). The difference between the observed color and the one\ncalculated for a SN Ia of this stretch are many standard deviations apart. Reddening, of course,\nonly makes this supernova more discrepant.\nThis result, seen in SCP99, differs from the result first presented in SCP97 due to the fact\nthat the fitting procedure used at that time did not vary the K-corrections as a function of stretch.\nAt this redshift, where the extrapolation is large, these differences are considerable. For SCP97\nthe stretch was determined to be 1.09\u00b10.05, which would place this supernova in the very broad\u2013\nbright\u2013blue category of SN Ia along the lines of SN 1991T(Phillips et al. 1992). The B \u2212 R color of\na SN 1991T-like supernova at this redshift is B \u2212 R \u2248 1.0 \u00b1 0.15, which, as pointed out in SCP97,\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nis only in mild disagreement with the observed color.4 .\nThe implication of this result is that SN 1994H was most likely a Type IIL or II-n supernova\ncaught at an early phase. Given that most SNe II look like blackbodies early in their light curves,\nthe B\u2212R color of 0.7 mag is not too surprising. In fact, the color at this redshift implies a blackbody\ntemperature of 9750 \u25e6 K, which is quite consistent with a SN II at this phase. Given a cosmology\nof h = 0.635, \u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 with a KBR = \u22120.68 for a 9750 \u25e6 K blackbody, we find that\nSN 1994H would have an MB ' \u221219.60. This would make it a rather luminous SN II along the\nlines of SN 1979C (Branch et al. 1981; de Vaucouleurs et al. 1981). This result strengthens the case\nfor the primary cosmology fit of SCP99 which excluded SN 1994H.\n\n9.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a method for performing generalized K-corrections for SNe Ia which allows\nus to compare these objects from the UV to near-IR over the redshift range 0.0 < z < 2.0 along\nwith the corresponding uncertainties currently associated with this method. These uncertainties\nare in general much smaller when compared to the uncertainties in the extinction corrections.\nFuture data will certainly improve upon this method considerably, especially if properly calibrated\nspectral templates can be acquired for each sub-class of SNe Ia. We have also examined the effects\nof reddening on the light curves of nearby SNe Ia and how our current, poor understanding of the\nbehavior of SNe Ia in the UV effect the use of SNe Ia at both high- and low-redshift.\nWe would like to thank Mark Phillips for many helpful discussions, particularly those concerning the U - and I-band photometric measurements of nearby SNe Ia. We would also like to thank\nAdam Riess and Weidong Li for a discussion that led to a great simplification of the section on\nextinction corrections and Robert Knop on supplying R- and I-band templates of nearby SNe Ia\nprior to publication.

The distance modulus is measured as the difference\nbetween observed and absolute magnitudes of a \"standard candle\" after K-correction (Oke &\n4\n\nIn addition, one should note that improved final-reference photometry taken of SN 1994H after SCP97 was\npublished produced small changes in the overall light-curve shape.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nSandage 1968) for the redshifting of its spectrum. The theoretical value for \u03bc is related to the\nluminosity distance dL (z) defined such that a source with luminosity L at redshift z has observed\nenergy flux f as if the energy has been diluted to the surface of a sphere with radius dL , i.e.\nL = 4\u03c0d2L f (e.g. Carroll et al. (1992)). Cosmological parameters can then be measured from their\nfunctional dependence on dL .\nObservations are in fact made with photon counters (CCD's, photo-multipliers) and the luminosity distance is not the same as the \"photon luminosity distance\" d\u03b3 ; if N is the photon\nluminosity and n is the observed photon flux, then N = 4\u03c0d2\u03b3 n where dL = d\u03b3 (1 + z)1/2 . This\nhas lead to some confusion as to whether a \"photon\" distance modulus should be used to measure cosmological parameters, whether the magnitude system is photon-based or energy-based, and\nwhich K-corrections should be applied. Such distinctions which previously have been unimportant\nare significant as we move into an era of precision cosmology. In this appendix we rederive and\nexpand upon the K-correction results of Schneider et al. (1983). We comment on the magnitude\nsystem and the Johnson-Cousins system in particular (\u00a7 A.1). We find that any ambiguity can\nbe removed with the proper definition of the K-correction for which we derive the equations for\nboth photon and energy systems (\u00a7 A.2). We conclude that although the differences between the\ntwo K-corrections are small, the distinction between energy and photon systems is important for\nplanned future high-precision supernova experiments (\u00a7 A.3).\n\nA.1.\n\nMagnitude Systems\n\nThe primary standards of a photometric system can have their magnitudes measured either by\ntheir energy or photon flux ratios. Unless a photon\u2013energy conversion correction is later applied,\nthe flux system is determined by the detectors used to measure the primaries. The type of detector\nused in subsequent observations does not determine whether the magnitude system is photon or\nenergy based; in principle the color and airmass corrections put observed magnitudes into the\nprimary system.\nThe Johnson-Cousins magnitude system prevalent today is a photon system, what Johnson &\nMorgan (1953) describe as \"a system of photoelectric photometry\". As described in Johnson &\nMorgan (1951), their observational setup employed a photomultiplier as a detector, with the counts\nbeing the number of \"deflections\" recorded by a potentiometer. After an airmass correction these\ncounts were directly converted to magnitudes. The secondary stars of Landolt (1973, 1983, 1992)\n(whose raw data also were obtained with photon counters) are calibrated via Johnson and Cousins\nprimary standards and thus must be in the photon system. Observed magnitudes are therefore\nphoton-based and should be analyzed as such.\nAn illustrative example of where there is a numerical difference between the two magnitude\nsystems is a star that has the same integrated B-band energy flux as Vega (which for simplicity\nwe consider to be the zero point of the magnitude system) but has a different photon flux since it\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nhas a different spectral energy distribution (SED). Relative magnitude measurements with a single\nfilter of a set of stars with similar spectral energy distributions are independent of whether we are\nphoton counting or measuring energy; two stars with the same SED but differing brightness will\nhave\n\u2206m = m\u03b32 \u2212 m\u03b31 = m\u01eb2 \u2212 m\u01eb1\nwhere m1 and m2 are the stars' magnitudes. It follows that since the zeropoint of magnitude system\nis based on Vega, the energy and photon magnitudes of A0V stars are identical: m\u03b3A0V = m\u01ebA0V .\nAs an aside, one of the Johnson & Morgan (1953) criteria for a photometric system is \"a\ndetermination of the zero point of the color indices in terms of a certain kind of star which can\nbe accurately defined spectroscopically.\" Such knowledge, along with the shapes of the passband transmission functions, do allow for calculated transformation between photon and energy\nmagnitude systems. Indeed, much effort has been placed in measuring and modeling the intrinsic\nSED of Vega (Dreiling & Bell (1980) and references therein).\n\nA.2.\n\nThe K-correction\n\nWe explicitly review the K-correction calculation of Kim et al. (1996) that has been used in\nSCP cosmological analysis. To remove any ambiguity we define the K-correction Kxy such that\n\u03b1\nm\u03b1y = Mx\u03b1 + \u03bc(z) + Kxy\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = {\u03b3, \u01eb} for photon or energy magnitude systems. The observed magnitude in passband\ny is my and the absolute magnitude in passband x is Mx . We adopt the theoretical expression\nfor the distance modulus, \u03bc, based on luminosity distance. In other words, the functional form of\n\u03bc(z; H0 , \u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) in Equation A1 is identical for photon and energy systems. Given f\u03bb (\u03bb) as the\nenergy flux density of a supernova 10 parsecs away, we can compute the corresponding energy and\nphoton fluxes at high redshift.\nf\u03bb (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nn\u03bb (\u03bb)d\u03bb =\nf\u03bbz (\u03bb)d\u03bb =\nnz\u03bb (\u03bb)d\u03bb =\n\n\u03bbd\u03bb\nhc f\u03bb (\u03bb)\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n10pc\nd\u03bb\n\u03bb\nf\n\u03bb\n1+z\n1+z\ndL (z)\n\u03bbd\u03bb\nhc(1+z) f\u03bb\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bb\n1+z\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n10pc\ndL (z)\n\nEnergy flux density in d\u03bb bin of a supernova 10 parsecs away\nPhoton flux in d\u03bb bin of a supernova 10 parsecs away\nEnergy flux density in d\u03bb bin of a supernova at z\n\u00112\n\nPhoton flux density in d\u03bb bin of a supernova at z\n\nThe (1 + z)\u22121 terms in the redshifted flux densities are due to wavelength dilution (Oke & Sandage\n1968). The ratio between high and low-redshift photon flux is a factor 1 + z greater than the\ncorresponding ratio for energy flux which suffers from redshifted energy loss.

(The transmission functions give the fraction of photons transmitted at a given\nwavelength where we assume no down-scattering.) For the standard star (i.e. calibrator) SED Z(\u03bb)\nwe assume the existence of a standard star with identical properties as the supernova, i.e. with\nexactly the same color and observed through the same airmass. Pragmatically, this assumption\naffirms perfect photometric calibration to all orders of color and airmass. For convenience, we\nchoose these secondary standards to have 0 magnitude. In principle, a different standard will be\nneeded for each filter, choice of photon or energy flux, and each source SED. Each standard is\n\u03b1 where X = {U, B, V, R, I, . . .} and \u03b1 = {\u03b3, \u01eb} for photon or energy flux as defined\nlabeled ZX\nearlier.\nEquations A3 and A4 generalize the K-corrections of Schneider et al. (1983)5 and are precisely\nthose given and calculated in KGP96. In that paper, it was found that the differences between the\n\u01eb \u2212 K \u03b3 | < 0.07 magnitudes. They are a function\ntwo K-corrections are non-zero but small, |Kxy\nxy\nof redshift, filters, and supernova epoch and thus can cause small systematic shifts in light-curve\nshapes and magnitude deviations in the Hubble diagram. The use of the incorrect K-correction\nwill have a significant effect on experiments with small < 0.1 targeted magnitude errors.\n\u03b3\n\u01eb\nTo illustrate, in Figure 15 we plot KBZ\n\u2212 KBZ\n(where Z refers to the passband and not\nredshift) for a standard Type Ia supernova at B maximum and 15 rest-frame days after maximum\nout to z = 2. The differences are close to zero at z \u223c 1.1 where B(\u03bb/(1 + z)) \u223c Z(\u03bb). Beyond this\noptimal redshift, the differences can be > 0.01 magnitudes. The redder color of the supernova at\nthe later epoch gives relatively larger photon K-corrections over almost all redshifts.\n\nThe similarity in the two K-corrections is due to two competing terms that nearly cancel.\nA photon K-correction is 1 + z brighter because the supernova does not suffer redshifting energy\nloss. However, the zeropoint of the redder filter used to observe the redshifted supernova is larger\nsince an A0V photon spectrum is flatter than its energy spectrum. This makes the observed\nsupernova magnitude numerically fainter. Consider the special case where Sy (\u03bb) = Sx (\u03bb/(1 + z)).\n5\n\nNote that in the notation of Schneider et al. (1983), f\u03bd and f\u03bd(1+z) are the same function evaluated at different\nfrequencies.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nWith perfect filter-matching the specifics of the supernova spectrum are unimportant and the Kcorrections depend on the zeropoints:\n!\nR \u01eb\nZ\n(\u03bb)S\n(\u03bb)d\u03bb\nx\n\u01eb\n(A5)\nKxy\n= \u22122.5 log R x\u01eb\nZy (\u03bb)Sy (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nR\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(1 + z) \u03bbZx\u03b3 (\u03bb)Sx (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\u03b3\nR\n(A6)\nKxy = \u22122.5 log\n\u03bbZy\u03b3 (\u03bb)Sy (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nR\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(1 + z) < \u03bbx > Zx\u03b3 (\u03bb)Sx (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nR \u03b3\n= \u22122.5 log\n(A7)\n< \u03bby > Zy (\u03bb)Sy (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\nwhere < \u03bb > is the effective wavelength of the standard through the filter. As long as the standard\nstar is well behaved, we expect the effective wavelength of the redshifted filter to be 1 + z greater\nthen that of the restframe filter < \u03bby >\u223c (1 + z) < \u03bbx > so that\n!\nR \u01eb\n(\u03bb)S\n(\u03bb)d\u03bb\nZ\nx\n\u01eb\n\u03b3\n= Kxy\n.\n(A8)\nKxy\n\u223c \u22122.5 log R x\u01eb\nZy (\u03bb)Sy (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nChoosing filters that accept the same spectral region at both low and high redshifts not only reduces\nerrors but also reduces the difference between energy and photon K-corrections.\n\nThe effect of using the \"energy\" distance modulus in defining the K-correction in Equations A1,\nA3, and A4 are seen in the open-filter K-corrections. When Sx = Sy = 1, the energy K-correction\n\u01eb = 0. For the photon K-correction we find K \u03b3 = \u22122.5 log (1 + z),\nis unnecessary and indeed Kxy\nxy\nthe difference between \"energy\" and \"photon\" distance moduli.\nA simple measure for the difference between single-filter K-corrections is the ratio in effective\nwavelength of a redshifted and unredshifted source through that filter. For example, sources with\npower-law SED's have identical photon and energy K-corrections. For low-redshift objects the\ndifference in effective wavelength should be very small (unless they have pathological spectra)\nand thus make little difference in distance determinations. For example, a Type Ia supernova at\nmaximum at z = 0.1 observed through the B-band would have a distance modulus error of 0.02\nmagnitudes if the wrong K-correction were applied.\n\nA.3.\n\nFinal Notes on K-corrections\n\nIn this appendix we have shown that the measurements mY (z)\u2212MX do depend on whether the\nmagnitude system is based on energy or photon flux. Although the \"photon luminosity distance\"\nis shorter than the standard luminosity distance, we can still use the relation mY (z) = MX +\n\u03bc(z) + KXY with the appropriate definitions of the K-corrections; the ones of Kim et al. (1996)\nare appropriate. With this definition, the standard equations linking the energy distance modulus\nto cosmology are applicable. The Johnson-Cousins magnitude system is in fact photon-based.\n\u03b3\nTherefore, the KXY\nK-correction should and has been used in the supernova cosmology analysis\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nof the SCP. Although application of the incorrect K-correction would contribute negligibly to the\nerror budget of the current supernova sample, the distinction is important for precision experiments\nthat require 0.02 magnitude accuracies, such as the Supernova Acceleration Probe. With the choice\nof well-matched filters, differences between energy and photon K-correction can be minimal.\nUsing the \"count\" distance modulus based on d\u03b3 in Equation A1 would provide a more physically satisfying definition of the count K-correction. Recall that \u03bc\u01eb = \u03bc\u03b3 + 2.5 log (1 + z). Then\nthe extra 2.5 log (1 + z) in the K-correction would give\nR\n\u0012R\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bbZx\u03b3 (\u03bb)Sx (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\u03bbf\u03bb (\u03bb)Sx (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\u03b3\nKxy = \u22122.5 log R\n.\n(A9)\n+ 2.5 log R \u2032\n\u03bbZy\u03b3 (\u03bb)Sy (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\u03bb f\u03bb (\u03bb\u2032 )Sy ((1 + z)\u03bb\u2032 )d\u03bb\u2032\n\nIn other words, the K-correction would depend simply on the ratio of supernova photons in the\nrest-frame filter and a blue-shifted observer filter, and the zeropoint. This methodology would\npreserve the physical meanings that we associate with both distance modulus and K-correction.\nFor simplicity, however, we here adopt the energy distance modulus for both K-corrections to be\nconsistent with the literature and to ensure unambiguity when referring to K-corrected magnitudes\nand distance moduli.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAjhar, E.
