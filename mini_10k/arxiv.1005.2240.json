Later on, Jacobson [4] has demonstrated\nthat Einstein equations (describing relativistic gravitation) could be derived by combining general thermodynamic pictures with the equivalence principle. Padmanabhan [5]\nhas observed that the equipartition law for horizon degrees of freedom combined with the\nSmarr formula leads to the Newton's law of gravity.\nRecently, Verlinde has proposed the Newtonian force law as an entropic force (nonrelativistic version) by using the holographic principle and the equipartition rule [6]. If it\nis proven correct, gravity is not a fundamental interaction, but an emergent phenomenon\nwhich arises from the statistical behavior of microscopic degrees of freedom encoded on\na holographic screen. In other words, the force of gravity is not something ingrained in\nmatter itself, but it is an extra physical effect, emerging from the interplay of mass, time,\nspace, and information.\nAfter his work, taking the apparent horizon as a holographic screen (HS) to derive the\nFriedmann equations [7], derivation of the Friedmann equations using the equipartition\nrule and unproved Unruh temperature [8, 9], the modified equipartition rule to discuss\nthe large scale universe [10], and the correction to the entropic force by the correctedentropy [11] were investigated for cosmological purpose. The connection to the loop\nquantum gravity [12], the accelerating surfaces [13], holographic actions for black hole\nentropy [14], and application to holographic dark energy [15] were considered from the\nview of the entropic force. Furthermore, cosmological implications were reported in [16,\n17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], an extension to the Coulomb force [23], and the symmetry aspect of\nthe entropy force [24] were investigated. The entropic force was discussed in the presence\nof black hole [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The Schwarzschild spacetime was introduced to define\nthe holographic screen properly [30] and the entropic force did not always imply the\nNewtonian force law when imposing the non-gravitational collapse condition [31].\nHowever, one of urgent issues to resolve is to answer to the question of how one can\nconstruct a spherical holographic screen of radius R which encloses a source mass M\nlocated at the origin to understand the entropic force. This is a critical and important\nissue because the holographic screen (an exotic description of spacetime) originates from\nrelativistic approaches to black hole [32, 33] and cosmology [34]. Verlinde has introduced\nthis screen by analogy with an absorbing process of a particle around the event horizon\nof black hole. Considering a smaller test mass m located at \u2206x away from the screen\n2\n\n\fand getting the change of entropy on the screen, its behavior should resemble that of a\nparticle approaching a stretched horizon of a black hole, as described by Bekenstein [2].\nBefore proceeding, we would like to mention what is the difference between Newtonian\ngravity and general relativity [35]. First Newtonian gravity is an action-at-a-distance, that\nis, the gravitational influence propagates instantaneously (c \u2192 \u221e), implying the violation\nof causality. Second, Newtonian gravity is ignorant of the presence of horizon where the\nrelativistic effects are supposed to dominates. For example, the horizons are considered\nas either the event horizon of black hole or the apparent horizons in the FriedmannRobertson-Walker (FRW) universe. Comparing Newtonian gravity and general relativity\nin cosmology is different than in the case of isolated, asymptotically flat systems [36]. For\nisolated systems, both Newtonian gravity and general relativity are well-defined. In contrast, while relativistic cosmology is well-defined, there is no unique way to accommodate\nNewtonian theory of cosmology because the Newtonian equations are only defined up to\nboundary terms which have to be specified at all times.\nHence it is not easy to implement the entropic force into the cosmological setting. In\nthe literatures [7, 9, 11], the authors did not mention explicitly how the entropic force (3)\nworks for the cosmological purpose. It seems that the entropic force is not realized in the\nNewtonian cosmology unless the holographic screen is clearly defined.\nIn this work, we investigate intensively how the Newtonian cosmology is realized from\nthe Poisson equation and Euler equation, the energy consideration, and spherical cavity\ntogether with the cosmological principle. If the boundary surface enclosing the cavity\nfilled with the dust matter (or a source mass M) were replaced by the holographic screen\nto which the equipartition rule and the holographic principle are applied, the entropic\nforce would derive the evolution of the dust matter-dominated universe.\n\n2\n\nEntropic force\n\nWhen a test particle with mass m is close to a surface S (holographic screen) with distance\nh\u0304\n), the change of entropy on the\n\u2206x (compared to the Compton wave length \u03bbm = mc\nholographic screen takes the form [6]\n\u2206S = 2\u03c0kB\n\n\u2206x\n\u2192 2\u03c0m\u2206x\n\u03bbm\n\n(1)\n\n2\nin the natural units of h\u0304 = c = kB = 1 and G = lpl\n. Considering that the entropy of\na system depends on the distance \u2206x, an entropic force Fent could be arisen from the\nanalogy of the biophysics\nFent \u2206x = T \u2206S\n(2)\n\n3\n\n\fwhich may be considered as an indication that the first law of thermodynamics is realized\non the holographic screen. Plugging (1) into (2) leads to an important connection between\nentropic force and temperature on the holographic screen\nFent = 2\u03c0mT.\n\n(3)\n\nIt implies that if one knows the temperature T on the holographic screen, the entropic\nforce is determined by (3). Therefore, a key step is to determine the temperature on\nthe holographic screen. Let us assume that the energy E is distributed on a spherical\nshape of holographic screen with radius R and the mass M is located at the origin of\ncoordinate as the source mass. Then, we may introduce the equipartition rule to define\nthe temperature T [37, 5], the equality of energy and mass, and the holographic principle\nto give the number of states N, respectively, as\n1\nNT,\n2\nE = M,\nA\nN =\nG\nE =\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwith the area of a holographic screen A = 4\u03c0R2 . These are combined to determine the\ntemperature on the holographic screen\nT =\n\nGM\n.\n2\u03c0R2\n\n(7)\n\nSubstituting (7) into (3), the entropic force is realized as the Newtonian force law\nFent =\n\nGmM\n.\nR2\n\n(8)\n\nOn the other hand, considering that Unruh has proposed the connection between\nacceleration and temperature\na\n\u2192 T,\n(9)\nTU =\n2\u03c0\nEq.(3) leads to the second law of Newton\nFent = ma.\n\n(10)\n\nWe remind the reader that TU is the bulk temperature, while T is the boundary surface\ntemperature.\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nNewtonian cosmology from the Poisson equation\n\nWe start with the Poisson equation for the Newtonian potential \u03c6 [38]\n\u03c6,ii = 4\u03c0G\u03c1\n\n(11)\n\nwith i = 1, 2, 3. The continuity and Euler equations of fluid dynamics are given by\n\u03c1\u0307 + \u03c1vi,i = 0,\n1\nv\u0307i + \u03c6,i + p,i = 0,\n\u03c1\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere vi is the velocity field and p is the pressure. Homogeneity implies that the density\nand pressure are merely functions of time: \u03c1(t) and p(t). Also the velocity field is the same\nrelative to all observers, which implies vi = Vij (t)xj . Substituting the Poisson equation\ninto the Euler equation leads to the fact that the Newtonian potential must take the form\n\u03c6 = aij (t)xi xj + a(t).\n\n(14)\n\nHence, the Newtonian approximation of a homogeneous cosmology is determined by\naii = 4\u03c0G\u03c1, \u03c1\u0307 + \u03c1Vii = 0, V \u0307ij + Vik Vkj = aij .\n\n(15)\n\nBefore we proceed, we mention that the relativistic (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker: FRW)\ncosmology is based on the isotropy and homogeneity. Thus, we will only consider the\nisotropic case where (15) becomes shear-free and rotation-free. However, in general, the\nNewtonian cosmology is anisotropic where there exist shear and rotation. To this end, we\nconsider the following SO(3) decomposition\n1\nVij = \u03b8\u03b4ij + \u03c3ij + wij ,\n3\n\n(16)\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b8 = Vii , \u03c3ij = (Vij + Vji ) \u2212 \u03b8\u03b4ij , wij = (Vij \u2212 Vji ).\n2\n3\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n\nHere, the trace part \u03b8 denotes the expansion, the trace-free symmetric tensor \u03c3ij represents the shear, and the anti-symmetric tensor wij describes the rotation. Plugging this\ndecomposition into the Euler equation, and setting \u03c3ij = 0 and wij = 0 for a shearfree and rotation-free fluid, we obtain the equation for \u03b8 and the diagonalization of aij ,\nrespectively,\n1\n1\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2212 \u03b82 \u2212 4\u03c0G\u03c1, aij = akk \u03b4ij\n3\n3\n5\n\n(18)\n\n\fwith continuity equation\n\u03c1\u0307 + \u03c1\u03b8 = 0.\n\n(19)\n\n \u0307\n\nR\u0303\nin terms of a Newtonian scale factor R\u0303, the\nRewriting the expansion parameter \u03b8 = 3 R\u0303\nsolution to the continuity equation (19) is\n\n\u03c1=\n\nC\u2032\n,\nR\u03033\n\n(20)\n\nwith C \u2032 a constant.\nUsing (20) in the Euler equation, we see that the isotropic and homogeneous Newtonian\ncosmology is described by\naii = 4\u03c0G\u03c1,\n \u0308\n4\nR\u0303\n= \u2212 \u03c0G\u03c1,\n3\nR\u0303\nC\u2032\n\u03c1 =\n.\nR\u03033\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\nAt this stage, we mention the FRW case whose equations are given by the Friedmann\nequation without the tilde ( \u0303) notation\n\u1e58\nR\n\n!2\n\n8\nk\n= \u03c0G\u03c1 \u2212 2 ,\n3\nR\n\n(24)\n\nand the Raychaudhuri equation\n!\n\n(25)\n\n\u1e58\n= 0.\nR\n\n(26)\n\nR\u0308\n4\u03c0G\n\u03c1 + 3p ,\n=\u2212\nR\n3\nfrom which one may obtain the Bianchi identity\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3 \u03c1 + p\n\n!\n\nWe note the difference that R(t) is the relativistic scale factor in (24)-(26), while R\u0303(t) is\nthe Newtonian scale factor in the Newtonian cosmology (21)-(23).\nWe are now in a position to compare these two theories. The general relativistic theory\nis well-posed. Equations (24) and (25) are consistent with the Bianchi identity. In the\nNewtonian theory there is only one equation (21), and there is no completeness because\n(21) does not give (22) and (23), and nor is the theory well-posed. Also, notice that in the\ngeneral relativistic theory, pressure occurs in the dynamics of the theory, whereas in the\n6\n\n\fNewtonian theory, pressure does not occur anywhere in the dynamics and is only defined\nthrough an equation of state. Equation (22) has the same form as the Raychaudhuri\nequation (at least when p = 0).\nLet us answer to the question of how do R(t) and R\u0303(t) differ. Considering\naii\n\n \u0308\nR\u0303\n= \u22123 , a(t) = \u0226,\nR\u0303\n\n(27)\n\nthe Poisson equation (21) yields\n \u0308\n4\nR\u0303\n= \u2212 \u03c0G\u03c1.\n3\nR\u0303\n\n(28)\n\nThis is again the Raychaudhuri equation of general relativity for the dust matter p = 0.\nHence, the general relativistic scale factor R(t) is equivalent to the Newtonian scale factor\nR\u0303(t). However, it is argued that Newtonian cosmology is applicable only when confined\nto a neighborhood of the observer, corresponding to distances which are small compared\nto the Hubble distance dH = 1/H. Therefore, it is problematic to define the apparent\nhorizon as the holographic screen in the Newtonian cosmology. For a flat spacetime, the\napparent horizon occurs at rA = 1/H.\nFurthermore, the Newtonian theory suffers in that varying the equation of state p = \u03c9\u03c1\nwill have no effect on the outcome of the solutions for \u03c1(t) and R\u0303(t). This is because the\npressure does not appear in the dynamical equations. Thus, we may at most reproduce\nthe results of the matter-dominated case of general relativity. Finally, it is worth to note\nthat the Friedmann equation (24) was missed in the Newtonian cosmology. This equation\ncould be realized from another approach of Newtonian mechanics together with its energy\nconsideration.\nConsequently, the Euler equation (13) leads to the Raychaudhuri equation (22) for the\ndescription of Newtonian cosmology when combined with the cosmological principle.\n\n4\n\nNewtonian cosmology from energy\n\nIn this section, we will show how the Friedmann equation (24) comes out from the Newtonian mechanics. We propose that a system of the universe consists of a number N of\ngalaxies with their mass mp and position rp (t) = rp (t)r\u0302 as measured from a fixed origin\nO [39]. Then the kinetic energy T of the system is given by\nN\n1X\nmp \u1e59p2 .\nT =\n2 p=1\n\n7\n\n(29)\n\n\fThe gravitational potential energy V is\nVg = \u2212G\n\nN\nX\n\nmp mq\n.\np<q |rp \u2212 rq |\n\n(30)\n\nThen, the total energy E of this system is given by\nE=\n\nN\nN\nX\n1X\nmp mq\nmp \u1e59p2 \u2212 G\n.\n2 p=1\np<q |rp \u2212 rq |\n\n(31)\n\nSuppose that the distribution and motion of the system is known at some fixed epoch\nt = t0 as an initial condition. Invoking the cosmological principle of homogeneity and\nisotropy, the radial motion at any time t is then given by rp (t) = S(t)rp (t0 ) where S(t)\nis a universal function of time which is the same for all galaxies and is related to the\nNewtonian scale factor. Substituting this into Eq.(31) leads to an energy relation\nE = A\u1e60(t)2 \u2212 G\n\nB\n,\nS(t)\n\n(32)\n\nwhere coefficients A and B are positive constants given by\nA=\n\nN\nN\nX\nmp mq\n1X\nmp [rp (t0 )]2 , B =\n.\n2 p=1\np<q |rp (t0 ) \u2212 rq (t0 )|\n\n(33)\n\nHere B contains the gravitational configuration of the system at the initial time t = t0 .\nEq.(32) is one form of the cosmological differential equation for a scale factor S(t). If\nthe universe is expanding, A-term decreases since the total energy remains constant as\nB-term decreases. Therefore, the expansion must slow down. Introducing the Newtonian\nscale factor with S(t) = \u03bcR\u0303(t), Eq.(32) takes the form\n \u03072\nC1\nk\nR\u0303\n=G\n\u2212\n,\nR\u03032\nR\u03033 R\u03032\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the constants C1 and k are defined by C1 = \u03bcB3 A and k = \u2212 \u03bcE2 A . When E = 0, \u03bc is\narbitrary. However, if E 6= 0, one can choose \u03bc2 = |E|/A so that k = 1, 0, \u22121. That is,\nthe sign of E determines the evolution of the universe: for E < 0, it will contract, while\nfor E > 0 it will expand. This equation is the same form of the Friedmann equation (24)\nof a relativistic cosmology. We mention that there exist ambiguities in determining the\ncosmological parameters C1 and k. However, we note that the term in the left-hand side\nof Eq.(34) originates from the kinetic energy, the first term (last term) in the right-hand\nside come from the potential energy (total energy). In order to derive the Raychaudhuri\nequation, one may use the conservation of energy (\u0116 = 0) to find\n \u0308\nGC1 1\nR\u0303\n=\u2212\n.\n2 R\u03033\nR\u0303\n8\n\n(35)\n\n\fC \u2032 , the above equation leads to the Raychaudhuri equation (25) with p = 0.\nIf C1 = 8\u03c0\n3\nOne may attempt to interpret (35) as the Newtonian force equation for a test mass with\nm = 1 on a S 2 of a proper radius of r\u0302 = r R\u0303(t). Here, R\u0303 is the Newtonian scale factor\nto describe the evolution of the matter-dominated universe. However, it is not clear that\n(35) is interpreted as the Newtonian force law.\nFinally, we have derived the Friedmann equation (34) from the energy condition together with cosmological principle.\n\n5\n\nNewtonian force law on an expanding cavity\n\nLet us introduce an expanding cavity of radius r\u0302 centered at O whose volume is V =\n4\u03c0r\u0303 3 /3. According to the Gauss theorem in Newtonian mechanics (Birkoff's theorem\nin general relativity), the net gravitational effects of a uniform external medium on a\nspherical cavity is zero. In other words, the force acting on a test mass located at the\nboundary of \u2202V = S 2 is the gravitational attraction from the matter internal to r\u0302 only,\nwhich may be considered as a point mass M at O. This is close to the situation to\ndefine the entropic force. However, we never choose this boundary as the holographic\nscreen. Here, we follow the classical approach to finding the Newtonian force law. The\nmechanical energy of a test particle at the boundary is given by the sum of kinetic and\ngravitational potential energy as\n1 2 4\u03c0\n1 2 GmM\n= mr\u0303 \u0307 \u2212\nGm\u03c1r\u0303 2 ,\nU = mr\u0303 \u0307 \u2212\n2\n2\nr\u0303\n2\n3\n\n(36)\n\nwhere the mass inside the cavity is\nM = \u03c1V.\n\n(37)\n\nRewriting the physical distance r\u0303 in terms of the comoving distance r and the Newtonian\nscale factor R\u0303 as\nr\u0303 = r R\u0303(t),\n(38)\nthe energy conservation law leads to\n2\n4\u03c0\n1\nGm\u03c1R\u03032 r 2 .\nU = mR\u0303 \u0307 r 2 \u2212\n2\n3\n\n(39)\n\nThis can be rearranged into the Friedmann equation as\n \u03072\nk\u0303\n8\u03c0G\nR\u0303\n=\n\u03c1\n\u2212\n,\n3\nR\u03032\nR\u03032\n9\n\n(40)\n\n\fwhere\n\n2U\nmr 2\nwhich is the same form as k in (34) when the correspondence is assumed to be\nk\u0303 = \u2212\n\nE \u2190\u2192 U, \u03bc \u2190\u2192 r, A \u2190\u2192\n\nm\n.\n2\n\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\nHence, we note that k\u0303 is constant, implying that U \u221d r 2 . This means that while U is\nconstant for a given particle, it changes if one looks at different comoving separations r.\nDifferentiating the energy conservation (36) with respect to time t (U\u0307 = 0), we have\nthe Newtonian force law on m located at the boundary surface\n \u0308 =\u2212\nmR\u0303\n\nGmM\n,\nR\u03032\n\n(43)\n\nwhich states clearly that the only force on m is due to the mass M inside the cavity. In\nderiving (43), we used the constant of mass M in the cavity\n\u1e40 = 0.\n\n(44)\n\nWe note that dividing the Newtonian force law (43) by m leads to the Raychaudhuri\nequation (35) which is an accelerating equation for the Newtonian cosmology. This means\nthat in the Newtonian cosmology, the Newtonian force law determines the acceleration of\nthe cosmological evolution. One may consider that (43) is the Newtonian force law for a\nmass m which is circulating around the source mass M because the left land side seems\nto be a centripetal force. However, for cosmological purpose, we consider the motion in\nthe radial direction but not the motion in the tangential direction.\nAt this stage, we introduce the first law which takes the form\ndE + pdV = T dS.\n\n(45)\n\nWe apply the first law of thermodynamics to an expanding cavity of unit comoving radius\nwith r = 1 filled by M. Using E = M, the first law leads to\ndM = T dS\n\n(46)\n\nwhich for an isoentropic expansion of dS = 0, it leads to (44) and finally\n \u0307\nR\u0303\ndM = 0 \u2192 \u1e40 = 0 \u2192 \u03c1\u0307 + 3 \u03c1 = 0,\nR\u0303\nwhere the last expression is simply the continuity equation (19) for the dust matter.\n10\n\n(47)\n\n\fConsequently, we have found the Newtonian force law on the test particle m located\nat the boundary of an expanding cavity from the energy consideration together with the\nconstant mass (continuity equation). We have considered regions smaller than the Hubble\nhorizon (r\u0303 \u226a 1/H) and the expansion velocity are small (v \u226a c) and thus, nonrelativistic\ndynamics are used. In this case, the first law of thermodynamics simply implies the\ncontinuity equation for the dust matter.\n\n6\n\nEntropic force and cosmological implications\n\nIn order to see what happens when the entropic force was introduced to describe the\ncosmology, let us consider a few of relevant works. For this purpose, a radical change\nshould be made such a way that the boundary surface enclosing the spherical cavity is\nreplaced by the holographic screen:\nboundary surface (\u2202V) \u2212\u2192 holographic screen (HS).\n\n(48)\n\nAccording to Ref.[9], the Raychaudhuri equation (22) was obtained by considering\nboth the equipartition rule (4) and the (Unruh) temperature\nT\u2217 =\n\nr R\u0308\nar\n=\u2212\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(49)\n\non the boundary screen \u2202V enclosing the spatial region of volume V = 43 \u03c0r\u0302 3 with r\u0302 =\nrR(t). Here, ar = \u2212d2 r\u0302/dt2 is considered as the physical acceleration for a radial comoving observer located at a point of the boundary screen. However, it is well-known that the\nproper acceleration vanishes for a comoving observer in the relativistic FRW approach.\nHence it is strange to introduce the (Unruh) temperature T\u2217 in the nonrelativistic approach. Explicitly, in order to derive the Raychaudhuri equation (22), they have used the\nequipartition relation directly\nNT\u2217\n.\n(50)\nE(= M) =\n2\nHowever, the (Unruh) temperature T\u2217 was not proven to be valid for this case. Padbanabhan [8] has shown that there is no simple justifications for defining T\u2217 using the\nacceleration of geodesic derivation vector and thus, his successes of obtaining the Raychaudhuri equation must be considered as fortuitous. This suggests that the recovery of\nthe Raychaudhuri equation from the equipartition rule together with the temperature T\u2217\nseems to be accidental. Otherwise, one has to explain why the equipartition rule with\nT\u2217 is equivalent to the Raychaudhuri equation for the dust matter. This could not be\n11\n\n\fexplained in view of the (nonrelativistic) entropic force because the equipartition rule was\nused to define the temperature on the holographic screen. We note that the temperature\nT\u2217 is positive only for a deceleration of matter-dominated universe. On the other hand,\nT\u2217 is negative for an acceleration of \u03c9 < \u22121/3, which shows that T\u2217 is not acceptable\nwhen extending other matter contents. Although they were succeeded in deriving the\nFriedmann equation (24) from the Raychaudhuri equation (25) by replacing the source\nmass M by the Tolman-Komar mass and integrating the resulting equation, it has nothing\nto do with a nonrelativistic force law of (2) and (3) because they have used the equipartition rule (50). Furthermore, it is not clear why the equipartition rule does provide the\nRaychaudhuri equation which corresponds to the Newtonian force law in the cosmological\nsetting.\nAs a slightly different approach, the author [11] has imposed the Newtonian force law\nfor a test particle m near the boundary screen \u2202V directly\nF = mr R\u0308 = Fent , Fent\n\n\"\n\n\u03b2 G\n\u03b3 G2\nGMm\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\u2212\nR2\n\u03c0 R2 4\u03c0 2 R4\n\n#\n\n(51)\n\nto find the corrected-Raychaudhuri equation by considering the corrected-entropy\nSc (A) =\n\nh A i\nG\nA\n+ \u03b3 + ***.\n\u2212 \u03b2 ln\n4G\n4G\nA\n\n(52)\n\nIt seems that this approach mimics the Newtonian cosmology because (51) is the same as\nin (43) when disregarding the correction terms. However, the origin of the force (Fent ) is\ndifferent from the Newtonian cosmology because he has used the equipartition rule and\nholographic principle prior to the derivation of the corrected-entropic force Fent on the\nholographic screen.\nThe other is a derivation of Friedmann equation by using the apparent horizon as the\nholographic screen and taking into account the differential of equipartition rule (equivalently, the first law of thermodynamics) [7]. They have started with considering the\nrelativistic FRW metric to define the apparent horizon. Hence, this is surely a relativistic\napproach. As was previously emphasized, it is unlikely to define the apparent horizon in\nthe nonrelativistic Newtonian cosmology. This amounts to introducing the Schwarzschild\nspacetime to define a proper holographic screen [30]. If one introduces the apparent\nhorizon rA properly, thermodynamics is defined by giving the Hawking temperature\nTA =\n\n1\n1\n, rA = q\n2\u03c0rA\nH 2 + k/R2\n\n(53)\n\nwith the Hubble parameter H = \u1e58/R. In this case, the differential of the equipartition\n12\n\n\frule is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics as\ndEA =\n\nTA\ndrA\nNA\ndTA +\ndNA =\n\u2190\u2192 dEA = TA dSA\n2\n2\nG\n\n(54)\n\nwhere\n\n4\u03c0rA2\n= 4SA .\n(55)\nG\nHence, the equipartition rule is nothing new but redundant. Supplying the perfect fluid\nas the energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd + pg\u03bc\u03bd like\nNA =\n\ndEA = 4\u03c0r\u0303A2 T\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc k \u03bd dt\n\n(56)\n\nthey have led to the Friedmann equation (24) and then, the Raychaudhuri equation (25).\nHowever, this approach is not a non-relativistic approach and thus has nothing to do with\nthe entropic force defined in (2) and (3), since the Friedmann equation was derived from\nthe first law of thermodynamics (differential of equipartition rule but not equipartition\nrule itself).\nFinally, we do not mention the entropic force applications to the accelerating universe [15, 21] and the inflation [40] because these issues are beyond the Newtonian cosmology.\n\n7\n\nDiscussions\n\nFirst of all, we wish to point out the difference between Newtonian gravity and general\nrelativity [35]. Newtonian gravity is an action-at-a-distance which means that the gravitational influence propagates instantaneously, implying the violation of causality. Also,\nNewtonian gravity is ignorant of the presence of horizon where the relativistic effects are\nsupposed to dominates. For example, the horizons are considered as either the event horizon of black hole or the apparent horizons in the FRW universe. It is suggested that the\nabsence of horizon does not enable to implement the holographic screen in the Newtonian\ngravity (cosmology). The holographic principle (holographic screen) appears in the black\nhole which is formed after the gravitational collapse through the supernova explosion and\nin the FRW universe based on the cosmological principle when using the relativistic approach [41]. In this sense, the holographic principle seems to have nothing do to with the\nNewtonian gravity (cosmology).\nIt seems that the entropic force (2) based on the biophysics is not realized in the\nNewtonian cosmology unless the holographic screen is implemented. Actually, there is no\njustification (48) of taking the boundary surface (\u2202V ) enclosing an expanding cavity V as\n13\n\n\fthe holographic screen (HS) which contains space, time, and information. Presumably, if\nthe holographic screen were introduced in the Newtonian mechanics, one would propose\nthe equipartition rule on the holographic screen. This means that gravitational attraction\ncould be the result of the way that information about material objects is organized in\nspace. Accordingly, we could define the entropic force to reproduce the Newtonian force\nlaw. This is a way of realizing an entropic force as an emergent phenomena which arises\nfrom the statistical behavior of microscopic degrees of freedom encoded on the holographic\nscreen [6]. However, this approach is too abstract to realize the entropic force. Thus, the\nVerlinde's proposition on the entropic force may be a hand-waving dimensional argument\non the gravitational (cosmological) side.\nIn conclusion, we have not confirmed the connection between Newtonian cosmology\nand entropic force. We hope that the Newtonian cosmology may provide a simple testbed\nto prove the entropic force.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was in part supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National\nResearch Foundation (NRF) of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and\nTechnology (NO.2010-0028080).\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
