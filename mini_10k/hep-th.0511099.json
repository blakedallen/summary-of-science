Introduction and Summary\nThe study of geometric transitions has been an extensive field of research in the past\nfive years. It started with the seminal papers [1][2][3] where the idea of connecting open\nstring theory with branes to closed string theory with fluxes was spelled out. The upshot\nwas a powerful recipe to derive effective field theory results from string theory compactification with branes and fluxes. Spectacular results have been obtained subsequently in many\ndirections. For example, earlier development of the string flux compactifications [4][5] now\napplied to this scenario, showed a new \"democratic\" way to think about effective theories\ncoming from string compactifications.\nThe direction opened in [3], based on the previous work on topological strings [6],\nhad a powerful impact on stretching the skills to use string theory to describe explicitly\nlarge classes of effective field theories. By matching effective field theory quantities such\nas gluino condensate and meson vacuum expectation values with geometrical objects, one\ncan use compactification details to get new insights into the strongly coupled field theories.\nThere were several avenues to accomplish that. One was to use matrix models to obtain\n1\n\n\feffective potentials and their extrema [7][8]. Another one was to translate geometrical\nresults regarding period matrices into field theory language [9][10][11][12]. A dynamical\nway to undertand the above match is to use an M theory description where the branes and\ngeometries have a description in terms of unique M5 branes [13][14][15][16].\nMore recently it has become clear that some aspects of geometric transitions in [3]\nhave to be reconsidered to accomodate some \"exotic\" NS forms that are needed to have\na precise match between field theory and geometric quantities. This was pointed out in\n[17] for compact manifolds and has been succesfully implemented for geometric transitions in [18][19]. This implementation requires a departure from the compactification with\nSU (3) holonomy, i.e. standard Calabi-Yau manifolds, to a larger class of manifolds with\nSU (3) structure, i.e. non-K\u00e4hler manifolds. The same happens in M theory where the G2\nholonomy condition should be dropped in favor of a more general G2 structure condition.\nHowever the above development of geometric transition [3], although spectacular\nin many respects, lacked the preciseness of the equivalent Klebanov-Strassler [1] or\nMaldacena-Nunez [2] models because of the absence of a complete supergravity description\nof the system. An attempt to get the full supergravity description was started in a series\nof papers [18], [19] by following a duality chain that used some aspects of T-duality and\nmirror symmetry advocated in [20]. The program of following this chain by a step-by-step\napplication of known dualities turned out to be highly non-trivial because the duality rules\nwere suited to some regime of parameter space that were opposite to the regime that we\nwould be interested in for studying geometric transitions. Nevertheless, with some subtle\nmanipulations we obtained the right metric in type II and M-theories. However, the metric\nthat we got in [18] and [19] turned out to be only a local description of a much more involved\nglobal framework. The global framework involves non-trivial orientifold actions giving rise\nto other D-branes and orientifold planes in addition to the already present wrapped five\nbranes. Our ideas can be summarized as follows.\nThe starting point of our program is a type IIB solution which is locally the one of [21].\nRecall that the solution of [21] describes D5 branes wrapped on the resolution two-cycle\nof a resolved conifold, exactly what one wants for an IR description of a N = 1 gauge\n\ntheory. The full global solution of [21] is not supersymmetric as discussed in [22], [18].\nTherefore, to get a supersymmetric background we embed this solution into an F-theory\nsetup. In terms of type IIB language this is done by considering extra D7/O7 branes\n\non a particular six dimensional manifold whose local metric (i.e. in the region where the\neffects of background D7/O7 branes are negligible) looks similar to the metric of [21], but\n2\n\n\fnow written in terms of local coordinates. From the F-theory point of view this is simply\na compactification on a fourfold with G-fluxes [4][23]. We will present the details of the\nconstruction of this fourfold in sec. 2.1. In short, the fourfold is a T 2 fibration over a\nsix-dimensional base that locally resembles a resolved conifold with fractional D3 branes1 .\nThe base is not a Calabi-Yau manifold because c1 6= 0 but will be K\u00e4hler2 . This is similar\nto the embedding of the Klebanov-Strassler background [1] in F-theory [5]. In this case,\n\nthe F-theory base is again approximately a conifold, and the G-fluxes appear in IIB as\nHNS and HRR fluxes.\nIn the light of these considerations, the field theory results should also be reinterpreted\nto accomodate the new branes and orientifolds. It is inherent to geometric transitions that\nthe gluino condensate in the brane side is identified with geometrical structures in the flux\nside. For the N = 1 theory on the D5 branes this means identification of \u039b3 with the size\nof S 3 cycles. In the setup presented here, additional fundamental matter is introduced.\n\nIn type IIB this corresponds to the D7 branes situated on top of the O7-planes. Their\ndistance from the resolution cycles is the mass of the corresponding fundamental quarks3 .\nConsider now a scenario where the D5 branes wrapped on the resolution two-cycle are\nclose to one orientifold plane. Clearly, then the other three orientifold O7 planes will be\ntoo far away from the wrapped D5 branes to be considered a part of the effective theory,\nso effectively there are only 4 relevant D7 branes on top of one O7 plane. This implies\nfor the field theory that the global picture represents an N = 1 SU (N ) gauge theory with\n\nmatter in the fundamental representation and flavor group SU (2)4 , the quark masses of the\nflavors being m and the scale of the theory being \u039bglobal . The global picture is obtained by\n1\n\nIn [18] we constructed a fourfold with non\u2013degenerating T 2 fiber. From our discussion,\n\nthis would capture only the local behavior of the system as the degeneration points of the fiber\n(alternatively the positions of the seven branes) are not in the local neighborhood.\n2\n\nThe base could be Calabi-Yau only at one special point \u2212 the orientifold point [24]. Clearly\n\nwe will not be in this region if we want to move the seven branes far away.\n3\n\nThere are two different matter multiplets (or flavor degrees of freedom) here in the UV. One\n\nof them are the matter multiplets coming from the strings that stretch between full and fractional\nD3 branes. These form the bi-fundamental matters, and are in general charged under both the\ngauge groups in the ultaviolet. The second one come from the strings stretching between full and\nfractional D3 branes, and the seven branes. They are the fundamental matters. At the far IR,\nwhen the D3 branes cascade away leaving only the fractional D3 branes, the theory will only have\nfundamental matter multiplets and no bi-fundamental matters. In this paper we will concentrate\nonly in this region, leaving a more detailed discussion of the UV behavior for the sequel.\n\n3\n\n\fstarting with N = 1 Sp(2N ) gauge theory and giving an expectation value to the adjoint\n\nHiggs which breaks Sp(2N ) to SU (N ) and the global group from SO(8) to SU (2)4 . The\n\nlocal picture therefore represents a pure N = 1 SU (N ) theory which is the effective theory\nafter integrating out the massive quarks with a scale\n\n4 3N\u22124\n\u039b3N\nlocal = m \u039bglobal .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThus, to go from a local picture to a global picture one has to integrate in the massive\nquarks as in [25]. We will soon see that the local picture is forced upon us by the identifications of geometric transitions.\nThe local geometry versus global geometry issue is also discussed in [5] where the\nlocal Klebanov-Strassler solution [1] gets the extra flavor group G globally. This makes\nthe Klebanov-Strassler solution an effective theory. The only difference is that in their\ncase the solution of [1] is supersymmetric, whereas our starting point, the solution of [21]\nis not. This can be understood from the fact that [1] uses integer and fractional D3 branes,\nthe latter being wrapped D5 on vanishing cycles. This is a susy configuration. When the\nvanishing cycle becomes finite (the conical singularity is resolved), the fractional D3 branes\nbecome genuine D5 wrapped on 2-cycles which4 , together with the integer D3 branes, are\nin general a non-susy system5 .\nFrom the type IIB solution one can infer a mirror IIA solution [18]. The result is a\nfamily of non-K\u00e4hler manifolds, the non-K\u00e4hlerity coming from the presence of type IIB\nNS flux. This means that the geometric transitions of [3] can actually be generalized to\nnon\u2013K\u00e4hler manifolds, as presented in [18].\nThe non-K\u00e4hlerity in type IIA theory is proportional to the NS flux so the non-K\u00e4hler\ngeometry can be considered as a function of the type IIB NS flux. However, in type IIB we\nknow from [9] that the NS flux is proportional to the coupling constant of the dual gauge\n4\n\nWe will also refer to these branes as fractional D3 branes.\n\n5\n\nAs we will discuss in sec. 2.1, it doesn't really matter if there might exist such a solution\n\nthat preserves supersymmetry (i.e allows primitive three form fluxes). Of course, to discuss the\ngeometric transition of N = 1 SU (N ) theory with fundamental flavor transforming under a group\nG, we have to introduce D7/O7 branes along with the fractional and whole D3 branes [26] (see\nalso [27] where somewhat equivalent construction, but only with D7 branes, are made to study\nKlebanov-Strassler model [1] with fundamental flavors). Our local metric studied earlier in [18],\n[19] is much more robust and it only depends on the topology of the resolved conifold.\n\n4\n\n\ftheory, and therefore the non-K\u00e4hlerity of type IIA solutions are inversely proportional to\nthe coupling constant of the field theory. Thus we see two possible limits:\n(a) The NS flux is (almost) zero. Then 1/g 2 in field theory is also near zero which means\nwe are in the extreme IR. So the K\u00e4hler limit of our solution is dual to the extreme IR in\nthe field theory.\n(b) The NS flux is large so the deviation from K\u00e4hlerity is big. Then 1/g 2 in the field\ntheory is large which means that we are in the far UV of the field theory.\nOur solution maps naturally to the one discussed in [28], where an interpolating\nsolution between the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) solution [1] and the Maldacena-Nunez (MN)\nsolution [2] was considered, with the MN solution obtained in the extreme IR. Both these\nbackgrounds are in type IIB. In the limit (a), our solution for wrapped D5 branes will only\nhave RR flux. This is similar to the MN solution. In the limit (b) and any intermediate\ncase between (a) and (b), our solution will have both NS and RR flux. This is a KlebanovStrassler type solution6 . The difference between our analysis and [28] is the fact that\nwe have an interpolating IIA solution, which appears very naturally in the form of the\nnon-K\u00e4hler deformation of the deformed conifold.\nThe distinction global/local picture translates onto the type IIA case. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in sec. 6. The wrapped D5 branes become wrapped D6 branes and\nthe stacks of D7/O7 become stacks of D6/O6 which are now located at fixed points of\na specific orientifold operation. The global group is SO(4)8 . In terms of field theory,\nthe global picture represents an N = 1 SU (N ) theory with matter in the fundamental\n\nrepresentation and a maximal flavor group SU (2)16 . If in the global picture, the field\ntheory has the same scale \u039bglobal and all the flavors have the same mass m, then the local\nscale is again given by the relation (1.1). This means that the mirror symmetry passes a\nfield theory consistency condition, namely, the scales of the effective theories are the same\nin type IIA and type IIB.\nWe will discuss in sec. 7 how our IIA solutions fit into the class of known susy backgrounds with torsion. For example, one type of solutions are discussed in [29] with nontrivial RR two-form and nontrivial dilaton. Here the nonzero components of the torsion\nclasses are W2+ , W4 , W5 . The second type of solutions are the half-flat solutions which were\n6\n\nA word of caution here. In [19] we showed that the gravity dual of N = 1 SU (N ) gauge\n\ntheory looks very similar to the Klebanov-Strassler [1] background with three form fluxes. However\nthere were some small differences which we will elaborate on later.\n\n5\n\n\ffirst discussed in [17] and are obtained as mirrors of type IIB solutions with NS flux. For\nthe half-flat solutions W1+ , W2+ , W3 are nonzero. The half-flat solutions were lifted to G2\nmanifolds by using Hitchin's Hamiltonian flow in [30].\nOur solution will be neither of the type discussed in [29] nor half-flat. Due to the elaborate F\u2013theory setup in IIB we will have fluxes turned on the lift to M\u2013theory that destroy\nthe G2 holonomy. We therefore expect only a G2 structure manifold7 . Furthermore, we\nonly have the local metrics available, so our torsion class analysis should not be taken too\nseriously. We cannot make statements about the global topology of our IIA backgrounds.\nThe local solutions are not susy and will therefore not obey any classification for susy\ntorsional backgrounds such as [29] or [17].\nIn contrast, in the heterotic theory we will propose, in sec. 3, a global background\nthat reduces in the local limit to the one proposed in [19]. The global background will\nlook very similar to the MN background [2], although it can in general differ from the\nMN background [2] by warp factors in the metric, but satisfies the torsional relation at\nleast in the limit where it agrees with MN. The method to construct heterotic solutions\nis to start with a slightly different F\u2013theory setup. We can trade the D7/O7 stacks for\nD9/O9. This way we reach a type I picture related to a heterotic picture by an S-duality.\nThis mapping implies a possible geometric transition for heterotic strings, as observed in\n[19]. The global heterotic solution is not neccesarily dual to a global type IIB solution\nas this would imply going away from the orientifold limit. Since the type II transitions\ncan be understood by studying the topological sector, we can use a half-twisted version to\nunderstand the transition for the (0,2) theories [31][32][33]. This will be addressed in sec.\n3.1 and sec. 3.2.\nWe will also study heterotic vector bundles in sec. 4. They are associated with the\nglobal group G that we encounter in IIB. The global symmetries appear as gauge symmetries of the SO(32) bundle in the heterotic side. In sec. 4.2 we will discuss possible ways\nto pull bundles across a conifold transition.\nAs we discussed above, the global type IIB picture leads us to the global type IIA\nmodel. This is basically the mirror of the type IIB background (once we take into account\nall the subtleties). In type IIA, however, we encounter some interesting scenarios. First,\n7\n\nThus the holonomy could even be SU (2) in some of these models. However, susy will be\n\ndetermined not by the holonomy but by the structure. So G2 structure but SU (2) holonomy will\npreserve N = 1 susy in 4 dimensions.\n\n6\n\n\fwe find that the global picture is generated from a specific orientifold action. Due to the\ninherent orientifold action we find some gauge fluxes that are secretly localised on the D6\nbranes. Some part of these fluxes may even give rise to three-from fluxes in the internal\nspace, although their effect in the local region of interest may be negligible. Globally\nthey might have some effects. Secondly, the same orientifold action produces three-form\npotentials that are not pure gauge. We find this a novel aspect of our model. The three\nform potentials are responsible for a smooth flop operation in the M-theory lift of our\nmodel. This was anticipated in [34] and [35], and here we provide the first concrete\nrealisation. These details will be presented in sec. 6; and in sec. 7 we will argue how these\nfluxes determine the torsion classes both before and after geometric transitions in type IIA\ntheory.\nBefore we go into the detail discussions of the above aspects, we should point out a\nsimple T-dual version in type IIA of the full type IIB global picture. First, one shouldn't\nconfuse this T-dual model with the mirror type IIA model. The mirror is a different\nduality that captures the full content of our type IIB model. The brane dual that we are\ntalking of are in the same spirit as [36], [37] and it captures only some aspects of our full\ntype IIB global picture. Nevertheless, many of the UV expectations will be clear from the\nT-dual. First, the resolved conifold will T-dualise into two intersecting NS5 branes, and\nthe fractional D3 branes will become half-D4 branes. This is same as our model in [13] and\n[14]. The D7/O7 system will T-dualise into a D6/O6 system that will be parallel to one\nof the NS5 branes and in fact will coincide with the NS5 branes. This is somewhat similar\nto the model advocated in [38] and in [27]. We differ from [38] in two respects: one, our\nbrane construction is the T-dual of a resolved conifold, and two, we have both full D4 and\nhalf-D4 branes. The model of [38], that is T-dual to a conifold, takes only full D4 branes,\nand therefore could study gauge theories with vanishing Beta-function only. We also differ\nfrom [27] because [27] studies the T-dual of a Klebanov-Tseytlin model [39] with D7 branes\nas flavors. As we know [39] behaves badly at the IR because of naked-singularity there,\nand Klebanov-Strassler [1] will be the right model to study IR of a confining gauge theory.\nSo the model advocated by [27] can say nothing about the IR behavior that we would be\ninterested in. Plus the flavors are given by only D7 branes in [27], that in general should\nbe viewed from an F-theory perspective which is lacking in [27]8 .\n8\n\nThese issues were in fact already pointed out in [27], although no solutions were presented\n\nthere.\n\n7\n\n\fIn the rest of the paper we will solve all the issues that could in principle plague the\nmodels of [38] and [27]. As discussed above, we can show much more than merely giving\nthe global story. We can discuss the full dynamics of geometric transitions in all string\ntheories, including M-theory.\nWe start by revisiting the root of all of these issues: the resolved conifold.\n\n2. Resolved conifold revisited\nThe original study of open-closed string duality in type II theory starts with D6 branes\nwrapping a three cycle of a non-compact deformed conifold. Naively one might expect the\ndeformed conifold to be a complex K\u00e4hler manifold with a non-zero three cycle. However\nas discussed earlier in [18] this is not quite correct, and the manifold that actually would\nsolve the string equations of motion is a non-K\u00e4hler deformation of the deformed conifold.\nIt also turns out that the manifold has no integrable complex structure, but only has an\nalmost complex structure. This is consistent with the prediction of [3]. The non-K\u00e4hlerity\nof the underlying metric can be easily seen from its explicit form9\nds2IIA\n\nh\ni2\n\u03bc\nb\nb\n= g1 (dz \u2212 bz\u03bc dx ) + \u22061 cot \u03b81 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b8i d\u03b8i ) + \u22062 cot \u03b82 (dy \u2212 by\u03b8j d\u03b8j ) + ..\n\n+ g2 [d\u03b812 + (dx \u2212 bx\u03b8i d\u03b8i )2 ] + g3 [d\u03b822 + (dy \u2212 by\u03b8j d\u03b8j )2 ] + g4 sin \u03c8 [(dx \u2212 bx\u03b8i d\u03b8i ) d\u03b82\n+ (dy \u2212 by\u03b8j d\u03b8j ) d\u03b81 ] + g4 cos \u03c8 [d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b8i d\u03b8i )(dy \u2212 by\u03b8j d\u03b8j )].\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the coefficients gi and the coordinates \u03b8i , \u03b8bi etc. are defined in [18]. The background\nhas non-trivial gauge fields (that form the sources of the wrapped D6 branes) and a non-\n\nzero string coupling (which could in principle be small).\n\nExistence of such an exact supergravity background helps us to obtain the corresponding mirror type IIB background. One would expect that this can be easily achieved using\n9\n\nIn deriving the metric, we took a simpler model where all the spheres were replaced by\n\ntori with periodic coordinates (x, \u03b81 ) and (y, \u03b82 ). The coordinate z formed a non-trivial U (1)\nfibration over the T 2 base. The replacement of spheres by two tori is directly motivated from\nthe corresponding brane constructions of [36],[37], where non-compact NS5 branes required the\nexistence of tori instead of spheres in the T-dual picture. In fact there is a deeper reason behind\nthis choice. The metrics that we studied earlier in [18] and [19] are actually local descriptions of a\nmuch more elaborate global story. As we will show, the local description only allows tori. We will\nsoon provide a derivation that will justify all the assumptions taken. In fact we will see that most\nof the assumptions are imposed on us by some stringent requirements on the type IIB metric.\n\n8\n\n\fthe mirror rules of [20]. It turns out however that the mirror rules of [20], as discussed\nin [19] and [18], do not quite suffice10 . A detailed analysis of this is presented in [19]. As\ndiscussed in [18] and [19], we have to be careful about various subtle issues while doing\nthe mirror transformations:\n(a) The mirror rules of [20] tells us that any Calabi-Yau manifold with a mirror admits,\nat least locally, a T 3 fibration over a three dimensional base. This seems to fail for\nthe deformed conifold as it does not possess enough isometries to represent it as a T 3\nfibration11 . On the other hand, a resolved conifold does have a well defined T 3 torus over\na 3-d base, which can be exploited to get the mirror (see also [40]). It also turns out that\nthe T 3 torus is a lagrangian submanifold [41], so a mirror transformations will not break\nany supersymmetry.\n(b) Viewing the mirror transformation naively as three T-dualities along the T 3 torus\ndoes not give the right mirror metric. There are various issues here. The rules of [20]\ntell us that the mirror transformation would only work when the three dimensional base\nis very large. The configuration that we have is exactly opposite of the case [20]. Recall\nthat our configuration lies at the end of a much larger cascading theory. By UV/IR\ncorrespondences, this means that the base manifold is very small. Furthermore we are at\nthe tip of the geometric transition and therefore we have to be in a situation with very\nsmall base (in fact very small fiber too). In [19] and in [18] we showed that we could still\napply the rules of [20] if we impose a non-trivial large complex structure on the underlying\nT 3 torus. The complex structure can be integrable or non-integrable. Using an integrable\ncomplex structure, we showed in [19] and in [18] that we can come remarkably close to\ngetting the right mirror metric. Our conjecture there was that if we use a non-integrable\ncomplex structure we can get the right mirror manifold.\nIt seems therefore natural to start with the manifold that exhibits three isometry\ndirections - the resolved conifold. We can, however, not use the metric for D5 branes\nwrapping the S 2 of a resolved conifold as derived in [21], because it breaks all supersymmetry [22]. The metric that we proposed in [18] (where we kept the harmonic functions\nundetermined) is very close to the metric of [21] but differs in some subtle way:\n(a) The type IIB resolved conifold metric that we proposed in [18] is a D5 wrapping a two\ncycle that preserves supersymmetry. We will discuss this issue in more detail below.\n10\n\nThe mirror transformations used in [18] was to take a specific type IIB background and get\n\nthe metric (2.1).\n11\n\nThere is a subtlety about the local and global pictures that we will clarify soon.\n\n9\n\n\f(b) As explained in [18], [19], our IIB manifold also has seven branes (and possibly orientifold planes) along with the type IIB three-form fluxes. The metric constructed in [21]\ndoesn't have seven branes but allows three-form fluxes.\nThe local behavior of the type IIB metric is expressed in terms of non-trivial complex\nstructures \u03c41 and \u03c42 as dz1 = dx \u2212 \u03c41 d\u03b81 and dz2 = dy \u2212 \u03c42 d\u03b82 . The local metric then reads\nds2 = (dz + \u22061 cot \u03b81 dx + \u22062 cot \u03b82 dy)2 + |dz1 |2 + |dz2 |2\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere all the warp factors can locally be absorbed in to the coordinate differentials. In\nthis formalism the metric may naively look similar to the one studied in [21] but the global\npicture is completely different from the one proposed by [21].\n2.1. The full global picture\nTo consider the full global picture, let us consider an F-theory compactification on a\nfourfold which is a non-trivial T 2 fibration over a resolved conifold base. For simplicity we\nwill consider a compact base, although the non-compact base would be easy to generalize.\nTo preserve charge conservation, therefore we will remove the D5 branes for the time being.\nTwo results are immediately obvious:\n(a) Since the fourfold is a Calabi-Yau, the base will no longer remain a Calabi-Yau resolved\nconifold, and will have non zero first Chern class. The non zero first Chern class comes\nprecisely from the seven branes in the picture. Although not Calabi-Yau, the base is still\nK\u00e4hler12 .\n(b) In the presence of fluxes the metric of the fourfold only changes by an overall conformal\nfactor and therefore modulo this subtlety, we can consider a Calabi-Yau fourfold for our\ncase.\nIn the following we will also be able to shed light simultaneously on the fourfold after\nthe geometric transition in type IIB theory.\nWe start by considering F theory on a base B (whose local metric is given in (2.2)),\nso that X \u2192 B is an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold. Suppose that B contains a\n\nsmooth curve E \u2243 P 1 with normal bundle O(\u22121) \u2295 O(\u22121), and that there is a conifold\n12\n\nThus when the seven branes are kept at large distances, the torus fibration will look effectively\n\ntrivial in local region away from the seven branes. Here the manifold will effectively simulate\nvanishing first Chern condition. This will be useful later when we will try to give a topological\ntheory description for our background.\n\n10\n\n\ftransition from B to B \u2032 obtained by contracting the P 1 to a conifold and then smoothing.\nThis gives another elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold X \u2032 \u2192 B \u2032 .\n\nWe compute the Euler characteristic of X by topology. Recall that the Weierstrass\n\nmodel for X is obtained as a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in the projective bundle\nP = P(OB \u2295 OB (2KB ) \u2295 OB (3KB )).\n\n(2.3)\n\ny 2 = 4x3 \u2212 g2 x \u2212 g3\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith equation\n\nwhere y is a coordinate on the bundle OB (3KB ) and x is a coordinate on the bundle\n\nOB (2KB ) (hence they live in the dual bundles OB (\u22123KB ) and OB (\u22122KB ) respectively).\nThe third homogeneous coordinate z in the P 2 fiber corresponding to the factor OB has\n\nbeen suppressed. We also have that gk is a section of OB (\u22122kKB ) for k = 2, 3.\n\nThe elliptic fiber is generically smooth, but is a cuspidal cubic over points of B where\n\ng2 = g3 = 0, and is a nodal cubic over points of B where the discriminant13 \u2206 = g23 \u221227g32 =\n0 but g2 and g3 are not simultaneously zero. The zero locus of \u2206 is a complex surface S\ncontaining the curve D defined by g2 = g3 = 0.\nSince the Euler characteristic of a smooth cubic curve, nodal cubic curve, resp. cuspidal cubic curve are respectively 0, 1, 2 we obtain\n\u03c7(X) = 0 * \u03c7(B \u2212 S) + 1 * \u03c7(S \u2212 D) + 2 * \u03c7(D) = \u03c7(S) + \u03c7(D).\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe now make the following claim: \u03c7(X \u2032 ) = \u03c7(X), i.e the Euler characteristics do not\nchange under geometric transition.\nTo see this, note first that by the adjunction formula, KB is trivial after restriction\nto E. That means that g2 and g3 restricted to E are sections of the trivial bundle, i.e.\nconstants. Choosing these constants to be nonzero and generic, we see that S \u2229E is empty.\n\nFor X \u2032 \u2192 B \u2032 we adopt corresponding notation S \u2032 , C \u2032 , g2\u2032 , g3\u2032 . We can also contract\n\nE to a conifold B0 and adopt similar notation S0 , D0 , (g2 )0 , (g3 )0 . Note that g2 and g3\n\nuniquely fix (g2 )0 and (g3 )0 by assigning to the conifold point the (constant) value of g2\nresp. g3 on E. Since S \u2229 E is empty, we learn that S0 does not contain the conifold, hence\n\nS0 \u2243 S and D0 \u2243 D. Thus \u03c7(X) = \u03c7(X0 ). Now we see that S \u2032 and D\u2032 are deformations\n13\n\nNot to be confused with \u2206i , the warp factors appearing in the metrics.\n\n11\n\n\fof S0 and D0 which avoid the conifold, so have the same Euler characteristic. It follows\nthat \u03c7(X \u2032 ) = \u03c7(X0 ) = \u03c7(X).\nTo illustrate this a bit more, let us consider an example. Consider a singular quadric\nhypersurface in P 4 with coordinates (x0 . . . , x4 ) defined by the equation\nx21 + x22 + x23 + x24 = 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThis is B0 . The point (1, 0, 0, 0, 0) is the conifold. It has two K\u00e4hler small resolutions,\nrelated by flops. One of them, call it B, can be described by blowing up the plane defined\nby x1 = x2 = 0. This also leads to a toric description if desired. The conifold transition is\ncompleted by taking the equation of B \u2032 to be:\nx21 + x22 + x23 + x24 = tx20\n\n(2.7)\n\nfor any nonzero value of t. The Euler characteristics can be computed by schubert [42],\nobtaining 19728 for \u03c7(X) and \u03c7(X \u2032 ). This is perfectly consistent with the result derived in\n[14] (see also [13]) where the F-theory background for a fourfold after geometric transition\nwas derived. The resulting Euler characteristics evaluated there were precisely 19728,\nconfirming the generic derivation presented here.\nThe above picture is not complete unless we devise a way to add five branes in the\nsetup. This would mean that we take a non-compact base. The analysis of adding five\nbranes to the picture has been given in [18]. The novelty of this derivation is that we are\nno longer required to consider a local picture where the fourfold is viewed as a product\nmanifold (as in [18]). The full global picture implies the existence of seven branes on a\nsix dimensional manifold that has a blown up P 1 with wrapped D5 branes on it. This\ntherefore raises the question: can we show now that the correct local metric for our case\nis (2.2) as we have the full global picture at hand?\nKnowing the local type IIB metric before the geometric transition will clarify many of\nthe assumptions that we used in [18]. The metric that has been proposed in [21] is not the\nfull global picture because it does not contain information about seven branes etc. in the\nmetric (not to mention the issue of supersymmetry). It could at best be valid locally, but\nnot in the global coordinates the metric has been formulated in. We will therefore rewrite\n12\n\n\fthe metric of [21] using only local coordinates. The proposed metric of D5 wrapped on a\nP1 of a resolved conifold is given by [21]:\nh\n1\nds2 = h\u22121/2 ds20123 + h1/2 \u03b3 \u2032 dr\u0303 2 + \u03b3 \u2032 r\u0303 2 (d\u03c8\u0303 + cos \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c6\u03031 + cos \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c6\u03032 )2 +\n4\ni\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ \u03b3(d\u03b8\u03031 + sin \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c6\u03031 ) + (\u03b3 + 4a )(d\u03b8\u03032 + sin \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c6\u03032 ) ,\n4\n4\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the coefficients etc. are defined in [21], [18]. Globally this metric breaks supersymmetry, and the harmonic function h doesn't contain the information about the seven\nbranes (and orientifold seven planes). To rewrite the metric, let us define the coordinates\nin the following way:\n2z\n\u03c8\u0303 = h\u03c8i + q \u221a ,\n\u03b30\u2032 h0\n\n\u03c6\u03032 = h\u03c62 i + p\n\n2x\n,\n\u03c6\u03031 = h\u03c61 i + p \u221a\n\u03b30 h0 sin h\u03b81 i\n2\u03b81\n\u03b8\u03031 = h\u03b81 i + p \u221a ,\n\u03b30 h0\n\n2y\n\u221a\n(\u03b30 + 4a2 ) h0 sin h\u03b82 i\n\nr\nr\u0303 = r0 + q \u221a\n\u03b30\u2032 h0\n\n2\u03b82\n\u03b8\u03032 = h\u03b82 i + p\n\u221a\n(\u03b30 + 4a2 ) h0\n\nwhere h0 = h(r0 ), \u03b30 = \u03b3(r0 ) are constants measured at r = r0 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe coordinates\n\n(x, y, \u03b81, \u03b82 , z, r) are small deviations from their respective expectation values. Therefore\nwriting the metric using these coordinates will only give information about a small local\nregion. The metric after coordinate redefinitions (2.9) will take the following form:\nds2 = dr 2 + (dz + \u220601 cot h\u03b81 i dx + \u220602 cot h\u03b82 i dy)2 + (d\u03b812 + dx2 ) + (d\u03b822 + dy 2 ) + .... (2.10)\n\u221a\nwhere we have absorbed \u03b30\u2032 h0 in the defination of dr, and the dotted terms are higher\norders in (x, y, \u03b81, \u03b82 , z, r). Furthermore the coefficients \u220601 , \u220602 appearing in (2.10) are\ndefined as:\n\u220601 \u2261 \u22061 (r0 ) =\n\ns\n\n\u03b30\u2032\n\u03b30\n\nr0 ,\n\n\u220602 \u2261 \u22062 (r0 ) =\n\ns\n\n\u03b30\u2032\nr0\n(\u03b30 + 4a2 )\n\n(2.11)\n\nComparing the metric (2.10) with the one from [18], i.e (2.2), we see that (2.10) is the\nlimit of (2.2) when \u03b81 \u2192 h\u03b81 i and \u03b82 \u2192 h\u03b82 i (along with r = r0 ) in (2.2)! Thus (2.2) is\n\nthe correct local description of D5 branes wrapped on P1 of a resolved conifold that would\n13\n\n\fpreserve supersymmetry14 . Not only that, now we see why we expect two tori instead\nof two spheres in our metric (2.2). Locally a sphere is similar to a degenerating torus,\nand therefore expanding the sphere metric with coordinates (\u03c6i , \u03b8i ) (i = 1, 2) about a\npoint (h\u03c6i i, h\u03b8i i) we get the metric of a torus. In fact the tori in (2.10) are with complex\nstructures \u03c41,2 = i, which we boosted to obtain the appropriate large complex structure\n\nlimit [18]. Finally, as we have argued earlier, (2.2) is also consistent with the T-dual brane\npicture [37], [36] where it is natural to obtain flat tori from brane configurations. Thus all\nof these fit perfectly now.\nBefore moving ahead, let us entertain another possible scenario. The metric (2.8) is\nnon-supersymmetric, and therefore susceptible to quantum corrections. A generic quantum correction may change all the warp factors, and could even make the two spheres\nasymmetric (or even squashed). However if we remove the wrapped D5 branes, then the\nmetric (2.8) is the metric of a resolved conifold that could become supersymmetric in the\nabsence of fluxes. Question now is how robust is our local description (2.2)? Our local\ndescription along with the seven branes should preserve susy even in the presence of fluxes,\nas we argued above. To check this, let us assume that instead of (2.8) we start with another\nmore generic metric whose explicit form can be written as\nds2 = F0 (r\u0303) ds20123 + F1 (r\u0303) dr\u0303 2 + F2 (r\u0303) (d\u03c8\u0303 + cos \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c6\u03031 + cos \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c6\u03032 )2 +\ni\ni h\nh\n+ F3 (r\u0303) d\u03b8\u030312 + F4 (r\u0303) sin2 \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c6\u030321 + F5 (r\u0303) d\u03b8\u030322 + F6 (r\u0303) sin2 \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c6\u030322\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere Fi (r\u0303) are the warp factors, and the two spheres are now asymmetric and squashed.\nThe above metric (2.12) could either be interpreted as the deformation of (2.8) after\nquantum corrections, or as a generic type IIB metric on a resolved conifold with wrapped\nD5 branes. Whatever be our interpretation, far away from the wrapped D5 branes we\nshould simply see the resolved conifold part, as the effect of wrapped D5 branes would\nbe negligible. Furthermore primitivity is also restored at large distances, and this would\nimply that the warp factors should approach the values set by (2.8) with h(r\u0303) \u2192 1. We\n\nare of course not so concerned about the global behavior as we want to study the local\n14\n\nThus the replacement \u22060i (r0 ) cot h\u03b8i i \u2192 \u2206i (r0 ) cot \u03b8i in (2.10) is the local back-reactions\n\nof the added seven branes to finally convert (2.10) to (2.2) and preserve supersymmetry. When\nthe F-theory torus do not degenerate in local neighborhood, like what we took in [18], then the\nmetric (2.2) has very small \u03b8i dependences which means we are in the limit (2.10). Thus h\u03b8i i \u2192 \u03b8i\nkeeping r = r0 , is exactly what we meant by delocalization in [18].\n\n14\n\n\fmetric so that we can put in D7 branes and O7 planes in the system. The local metric\ncan be easily extracted from (2.12) using the small expansion trick that we had devised\nearlier. In the present case, the small expansion will be\nz\ny\n\u03c8\u0303 = h\u03c8i + p\n,\n\u03c6\u03032 = h\u03c62 i + p\nF2 (r0 )\nF6 (r0 ) sin h\u03b82 i\nr\nx\n,\nr\u0303 = r0 + p\n\u03c6\u03031 = h\u03c61 i + p\nF4 (r0 ) sin h\u03b81 i\nF1 (r0 )\n\u03b82\n\u03b81\n,\n\u03b8\u03032 = h\u03b82 i + p\n\u03b8\u03031 = h\u03b81 i + p\nF3 (r0 )\nF5 (r0 )\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere it is assumed that none of the warp factors Fi (r\u0303) would vanish near r\u0303 \u2192 r0 .\n\nFurthermore our small expansion for the warp factor\nFi (r\u0303) = Fi (r0 ) + p\n\n\u2202Fi\nr\nF1 (r0 ) \u2202 r\u0303\n\nr\u0303=r0\n\n\u2248 Fi (r0 ) for r \u2192 0\n\n(2.14)\n\nis thus justifiable. Therefore plugging (2.13) into (2.12), we can easily show that the local\nmetric is exactly of the form (2.10) with the only difference being that the \u22060i are now\ndefined as\n\nF2 (r0 )\n\u220602 = p\nF6 (r0 )\n\nF2 (r0 )\n,\n\u220601 = p\nF4 (r0 )\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich reduce to (2.11) once we remove the quantum corrections.\n\nOur small calculation discussed above actually has some profound consequences. It\ntells us that (2.2) is not only the right local metric for our case, but also that (2.2) is not\naffected by the details of the quantum corrections envisioned on (2.8). All the possible\ncorrections simply change the warp factors \u22061 and \u22062 . But there is an even more intriguing\npossibilty related to footnote 5 that we mentioned earlier. Imagine we do manage to find\na supersymmetric wrapped D5 brane system. The new metric should look like (2.12)\nprecisely because (2.12) captures all the essentials of a metric of D5 wrapped on two cycles\nof a resolved conifold. Thus the quantum corrected metric for (2.8) and the expected susy\nsolution will bear strong resemblance. However in both cases the local metric is exactly\n(2.2) so our local description with the metric (2.2) will not change and we can consider\nseven branes in the system to study N = 1 gauge theory with flavors. Integrating out\n\nthe flavors (i.e seven branes are far away or non-degenerating F-theory torus of [18]) is\nequivalent to considering the metric (2.10) locally and this is what was taken in [18]15 .\n15\n\nTo make this precise, the (r0 , h\u03b8i i) in eq. 5.2 of [18] is the (r0 , h\u03b8i i) of (2.9) here also.\n\n15\n\n\f2.2. Field Theory Interpretation\nIn geometric transitions, gluino condensates are identified with sizes of geometrical\ncycles. In the global picture discussed in the previous section, this identification will be\nbetween the gluino condensate describing the IR of the N = 1 SU (N ) theory and the size\n\nof the S 3 cycle in the deformed geometry.\n\nTo understand what happens in the local picture let us start from the discussion of\ntype I in [43]. On one wrapped D5 brane the field theory is N = 1 Sp(2) with some twisting\n\nof the normal bundle in order to account for the wrapping on a 2\u2013cycle. It also contains\n\n32 Sp(2) \"half-hypermultiplets\" which will become massive due to Wilson lines. After a\nT-duality to type IIB, we get a D5 wrapped on a P 1 cycle. If one concentrates on the\nvicinity of a single fixed point and the D7 branes which are located around this fixed point,\nthis gives rise to an Sp(2) or SU (2) theory with 4 massive flavors and a superpotential\nW =\n\nX\n\nmi Qi Q\u0304i + Qi AQ\u0304i ,\n\ni\n\ni = 1, * * * , 4\n\n(2.16)\n\nBecause of the Wilson lines in type I, the gauge group Sp(2) breaks to U (1) and the masses\nof the fundamental flavors will change as mi \u00b1 a, where a is the expectation value of an\n\nadjoint Higgs field.\n\nThe difference between global and local picture then amounts to whether or not we\nconsider the fundamental flavors to be part of the gauge theory16 . If we integrate out the\nflavors, then the IR gauge coupling of the effective theory will be constant.\nIf we do not integrate out the flavors, the gauge coupling constant will be given by\n1\n\u03c4 (z) = \u03c40 +\n2\u03c0i\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\nlog (z \u2212 m2i ) \u2212 4log z\n\n!\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere z is the complex direction orthogonal to the D7 branes. As \u03c4 depends on the size\nof cycles in the metric (2.1), functions like g2 are part of \u03c4 and will depend nontrivially on\nz, too. But the D7 branes are extended in directions both parallel and orthogonal to the\nP 1 cycle in the resolved conifold, therefore they will also be both parallel and orthogonal\nto the S 3 cycle in the deformed conifold. The coupling \u03c4 will then depend on both the\n16\n\nThe other flavors corresponding to the other three fixed points are already integrated out\n\nfrom an even richer theory. We will consider an intermediate scale to accomodate only one flavor\nfrom a specific fixed point.\n\n16\n\n\fintegral over A-cycle and B-cycle. The identification between \u03c4 and\n\nR\n\n(\u03c7 + ie\u22122\u03c6 ) HNS\n\nwill change if \u03c4 is given by (2.17). This is to be compared with the case in [16] where the\nflavors were introduced as infinite D5 branes wrapped on 2-cycles which do not intersect\nthe P 1 cycles and which become part of the S 3 after the transition.\nThis modifies the approach of [3] if the flavors introduced by D7 branes are still part of\nthe theory, but the original geometric transition (on the level of the effective field theory)\nis obtained if the flavors are integrated out.\nIn the case of N D5 branes in type I (and several D5 branes in IIB), we find gauge\ngroup Sp(2N ), which is then broken by the adjoint Higgs field to SU (N ). Again, the usual\ngeometric transition arises if all massive flavors are integrated out.\nThe local picture constructed in [18] and in [19] captures almost all the details of\ngeometric transitions envisioned by [3], as in this limit the effect of D7/O7 branes is\ninvisible. If the flavors corresponding to D7 branes are integrated in, then the picture of\n[3] has to be extended accordingly to accomodate the flavor degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, unless mentioned otherwise, we will stick with the simplest model where the D7\nbranes and orientifold seven planes are far from the resolution two-cycle of our manifold.\n2.3. Topological aspects and excursions into generalized geometries\nThe analysis of supersymmetry in type IIB theory that we gave above therefore relies\nheavily on the correct choices of NS and RR fluxes (including the RR fluxes from seven\nbranes). On the other hand, the topological sector of this model, which would be - say\nafter geometric transition - a B-model on a deformed conifold has no dependence on the\nRR fields. Does that mean that we are allowed to choose any arbitrary background HRR\nfields? We will at least show that the RR fields are quantized without leaning on the\nassumption that they are governed by the number of branes before geometric transition\n(because that would already assume correctness of the geometric transition).\nAn alternative verification of the quantization of RR fields can be done by considering\nwhich correlation function we expect to measure. Taking into account the HNS fields, the\nfermionic part of a Green-Schwarz superstring can be written as\ng\nkl \u1e57 q\u0307 r s\n\u03c8 \u03c8 \u03c8 \u03c8\nSfermionic\n= 4i\u03c8 p \u2206+ \u03c8 p + 4i\u03c8 q\u0307 \u2206\u2212 \u03c8 q\u0307 + Rijkl \u03c3\u1e57ijq\u0307 \u03c3rs\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere (\u03c8 p , \u03c8 q\u0307 ) are the two inequivalent spinor representations of the transverse D4 and\n[i\n\nj]\n\nthe sigma matrices are defines as \u03c3\u1e57ijq\u0307 \u2261 \u0393r[\u1e57 \u0393q\u0307]r with a similar definition for the other\n17\n\n\f\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0 \u0393ipq\u0307\ncomponents. The Gamma matrix has 8 \u00d7 8 blocks given as \u0393 \u2261\nwhich are\n\u0393i\u1e59s\n0\nused to define the \u03c3's above. In this notation we have to specify what we mean by the\ni\n\ncovariant derivative \u2206\u00b1 and Rijkl . The most generic definition of the covariant derivative\nwill be given as [44],[45]:\n\u2206\u00b1 \u03c8\nwhere\n\n1\nH\n2\n\nq(q\u0307)\n\n= \u2202\u00b1 \u03c8\n\nq(q\u0307)\n\n1\n+\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03c9\u2212 H\n2\n\n\u0013ab\n\npq(\u1e57q\u0307)\n\n\u03c3ab\n\n\u03c8 p(\u1e57)\n\n(2.19)\n\nforms the torsion and we have chosen the torsional connection \u03c9+ \u2261 \u03c9 \u2212 12 H,\n\nand not the other one i.e \u03c9\u2212 (see [45] for details on this). Observe that in the absence of\nHNS there is no such ambiguity and the GS superstring can be defined unambiguously.\nThe curvature Rijkl that we defined above is actually measured w.r.t. the connection\n\u03c9+ . We could also measure the curvature w.r.t. the other connection \u03c9\u2212 . If we define\n\n+\n\u2212\nRijkl\n\u2261 Rijkl and Rijkl\nas the other curvature17 , then the following identity can be easily\n\nverified:\n\n+\n\u2212\nRijkl\n= Rijkl\n\u2212 2H[ijk,l]\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhich also serves as the definition of the torsion [44], [45], [46]. We want to concentrate\non the topological nature of these models.\nAn efficient way to study the topological theory is to convert the GS fermions into NS\nforms, i.e measure the fermions as worldsheet fermions with (p, q) U (1) charges. This will\nelucidate the (2,2) nature of the lagrangian. Thus we will have\nj\ni\n(\u03c8 p , \u03c8 q\u0307 ) \u2192 (\u03c8\u00b1\n, \u03c8\u0304\u00b1\n) \u2208\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1/2\n1/2\n1/2\n1/2\nK\u03a3 , K\u0304\u03a3 \u2297\u03c6\u2217 T (1,0) M , K\u03a3 , K\u0304\u03a3 \u2297\u03c6\u2217 T (0,1) M\n\n!\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the two dimensional world-sheet and the background manifold is given by M\nwith a particular choice of almost complex structure. Therefore the 2d local complex\n\ncoordinates would be (z, z\u0304) and the corresponding 6d ones would be (T (1,0) M, T (0,1)M).\n\nThe manifold M therefore admits an almost complex structure which may or may not\n\nbe integrable. In type IIB M will be a conformally K\u00e4hler manifold with an integrable\n\ncomplex structure [19], whereas in type IIA, M will in general be a non-K\u00e4hler manifold\n17\n\n(\u00b1)i\n\n(\u00b1)i\n\nThe definition of these curvatures are Rjkl = \u2202k \u0393lj\n\nthe torsional connection.\n\n18\n\n(\u00b1)i\n\n(\u00b1)m\n\n+ \u0393km \u0393lj\n\n\u2212 (k \u2194 l) where \u0393\u00b1 is\n\n\fwith a non-integrable complex structure [18]. The sigma model action can now be rewritten from (2.18) to\nn\nSfermionic\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nj\nj\ni k j l\ni\ni\n\u03c8\u2212 \u03c8\u0304+ \u03c8\u0304\u2212\n= 2i(gij\u0304 + Bij\u0304 ) \u03c8\u0304\u2212 \u2206+ \u03c8\u2212 + \u03c8\u0304+ \u2206\u2212 \u03c8+ + Ri+j\u0304kl\u0304 \u03c8+\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere the curvature etc. are measured w.r.t. the right connection. Observe the appearance\nof g + B in the above action. This takes care of the torsion.\nThe topological twist in the absence of torsion acts on the bundle in the following\nway: it converts one of the fermion to a world-sheet one-form and the other fermion to a\nworld-sheet zero form [47]. In particular its action is:\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\ni\n(\u03c8+\n, \u03c8\u2212\n) \u2192 (\u03c8zi , \u03c7i ) \u2208 K\u03a3 \u2297 \u03c6\u2217 (T (1,0) M), \u03c6\u2217 (T (1,0) M)\n\n(2.23)\n\nwith a similar kind of action for the other pair. This implies that the correlation function\nof operators < O1 O2 O3 ....On > is given by the integral of the top form on the manifold\nM. Generically, operators in the twisted sigma model are of the form18\n\nOf = fi1 ...ip j\u03041 ...j\u0304q \u03c7i1 ...\u03c7ip \u03c7j\u03041 ...\u03c7j\u0304q = fi1 ...ip j\u03041 ...j\u0304q dZ i1 ...dZ ip dZ\u0304 j1 ...dZ\u0304 jq\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhich is basically a (p, q) form on the manifold M because (Z i , Z\u0304 j ) are the complex\n\ncoordinates on the manifold determined by an almost complex structure.\n\nIn the presence of torsion the issue of a topological twist is much more complicated.\n(2,2) nonlinear sigma models (before twist) with H \u2261 HNS = dB 6= 0 were first discussed\n\nin [49]. In fact the earlier mentioned two different spin-connections \u03c9\u00b1 will become useful\n\nnow19 . Due to the existence of \u03c9\u00b1 , there are two different complex structures compatible\nw.r.t. to the choices of torsional spin-connections [49]. These complex structures can then\nbe used to decompose the fermionic components of the (2,2) sigma model [50]. The zero\nmode distribution will be similar to the case without torsion:\nk\u2213 \u2261 dim ker \u2206\u00b1 \u2212 dim ker \u2206\u2020\u00b1\n18\n\nFor a review of topological correlation function the readers may want to refer to the original\n\nwork of Witten [47], or some of the recent review papers [48].\n19\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe heterotic side of the story is completed in [45],[46].\n\n19\n\n\fimplying vanishing first Chern-classes20 . Once such constraints are observed, the twisting\nproceeds in the standard way (see [50] for recent discussion where the techniques of [51]\nis used to do the twisting). A generic operator in such a twisted model looks similar to\n(2.24), and is therefore related to the cohomological states of the underlying manifold.\nThe above form of the correlation function and the operators solve the RR\u2013flux question we raised. Since the correlators involve (p, q) forms, they are related to H p,q of the\nmanifold M. Its elements are quantized and normalizable forms of the manifold, and\ntherefore the RR forms will be given by quantized normalizable three forms. And indeed,\nthese forms are related to the number of wrapped D5 branes in the dual picture21 .\nThe analysis presented so far only skims the surface of a much more rigorous structure.\nNot only the twisting can be elaborated for sigma models with (2, 2) supersymmetry, but\nthey also have a deeper connection to generalized complex structures developed by Hitchin\n[52] and Gualtieri [53]. These will be studied in the sequel to this paper. We will also try to\nconnect the type II solutions that we presented in [18] and [19] with the Hitchin\u2013Gualtieri\nsystem. A more recent paper analyzing some aspect of this connection is [50].\nBefore we proceed with the analysis of topological aspects of (2, 2) models, let us make\na few observations. These will be useful to relate the analysis to heterotic (0, 2) models.\nFirst, the (2, 2) action can be written in a concise way using superfield notation as [49]:\nS=\n\nZ\n\nh\ni\nd2 \u03c3d2 \u03b8 gij D\u03b1 \u03a6i D\u03b1 \u03a6j + Bij D\u03b1 \u03a6i (\u03c3 3 D)\u03b1 \u03a6j + ...\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhere \u03c3 3 is the third Pauli matrix and the dotted terms involve the four\u2013fermi terms. As\nis clear from the above action, the superfields \u03a6i , i = 1, .., d realize only the (1, 1) part of\nthe action. Additional supersymmetry can be implemented w.r.t. the two allowed choices\ni\nof the complex structure J\u00b1j\nas22\ni\ni\n\u03b4\u01eb \u03a6i = \u2212i(\u01eb+ D\u2212 \u03a6j )J+j\n+ i(\u01eb\u2212 D+ \u03a6j )J\u2212j\n20\n\n(2.27)\n\nThis doesn't mean that the target manifold has to be K\u00e4hler. In [45], [46] numerous non-\n\nK\u00e4hler manifolds have been constructed with vanishing first Chern class.\n21\n\nThe dual picture that we are talking about here is only the far IR story a-la [1]. We can also\n\nbuild a setup with spatially varying NS and RR fluxes (or infinite sequences of flop transitions in\nthe dual) like [12] but will not do so here.\n22\n\nWe are using both D\u00b1 and \u2206\u00b1 to write the derivatives in a sigma-model. The distinction\n\nbetween them should be clear from the context.\n\n20\n\n\f(2.27) is a combination of two different variations: one for chiral superfields in a (2,2)\nsigma model, and the other one for a twisted23 chiral superfield (see sec. 8 of [49]). This\nmeans that the very existence of Bij fields in the background implies a (2,2) sigma model\naction coupled to twisted chiral fields24 . This is basically the content of the action (2.26)\nas twisted chiral fields (say \u03b7 p ) couple with chiral fields (say \u03a6q ) as [49]:\nScoupling =\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd2 \u03c3d2 \u03b8 Kpq\u0304 (Da \u03a6p )(\u03c3 3 D)a \u03b7\u0304 q\u0304 + Kp\u0304q (Da \u03a6\u0304p\u0304 )(\u03c3 3 D)a \u03b7 q\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhich is precisely the B field coupling in (2.26) if we interpret \u03a6i as a superfield with both\nchiral and twisted chiral components.\nThe above observation has in fact interesting consequences for the connection of this\nmodel with generalized complex geometry developed recently by Hitchin [52] and Gualtieri\n[53]. This connection is explored in a series of papers [55],[56]. We only give a brief\naccount here and leave the detailed discussion for future work. The starting point is the\nobservation repeatedly mentioned above, namely: the action (2.26) as constructed naively\nshows (1,1) world\u2013sheet supersymmetry. The additional supersymmetry is implemented\nvia the transformation (2.27) which eventually enhances it to (2,2).\nWhere does the mathematical structure of generalized complex geometry fit into this?\nNote that once we have the (2,2) action in this form we can easily relate it to the fermionic\nterm in (2.18) or (2.22). Defining the bosonic part of \u03a6i as X i , the action (2.26) takes the\nfollowing form:\n1\nS=\n8\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nZ\n\nh\ni\n1 g\nd2 \u03c3 (gij + Bij )\u2202+ X i \u2202\u2212 X j + Sfermionic\n.\n4\n\n(2.29)\n\n23\n\nNot to be confused with the topological twist that we perform on this model.\n\n24\n\nAs is obvious from the above analysis, in the absence of B-field the target manifold has to\n\nbe K\u00e4hler for (2.27) to exist [54]. The presence of B fields allows two different complex structures\ni\nthat are covariantly constant w.r.t. to the two connections \u03c9\u2213 , respectively. The two complex\nJ\u00b1j\n\nstructures appearing in the susy variation (2.27) are perfectly consistent with the fact that chiral\nand twisted chiral superfield susy transformations require two different complex structures. These\ntwo choices of complex structure differ by the Pauli matrix \u03c3 3 , and this is the reason why \u03c3 3\nappears in the sigma-model action (2.26). All these details fit nicely with the expected theory\nof chiral and twisted-chiral superfields, as shown in [49]. Furthermore, as noted in [50], this\nbi\u2013Hermitian structure satisfies the definition for a twisted generalized K\u00e4hler target [53].\n\n21\n\n\fWritten this way, the action will require no other corrections25 and consequently be anomaly free. Observe that the right moving sector has eight fermions denoted as \u03c8 p in (2.18).\nOn the other hand, the left moving sector also has eight fermions denoted as \u03c8 q\u0307 . Together\nthey give rise to the (2,2) world sheet action. The bosonic part (i.e. the X i part) of the\nabove action can be re\u2013written in the following way:\nZ\n1\n1\n1\nSbosonic = p\u03bc \u2227 dX \u03bc + \u03b8 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc \u2227 \u03b7\u03bd + G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc \u2227 \u2217\u03b7\u03bd + B\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03bc is a one\u2013form on the world\u2013sheet and G\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd are related to the open\u2013string\ndata of a Seiberg\u2013Witten non\u2013commutative theory [57]. The above form of the action first\nappeared in [58] and is subsequently used by [55].\nSupersymmetrizing (2.30) is not difficult. The original action (2.29) is supersymg\nmetrized using Sfermionic\nterms. Here we see that susy requires the following substitutions\n\n\u2202\u00b1 X i \u2192 D\u00b1 \u03a6i ,\n\n\u03b7\u03bc \u2192 \u03a8\u00b1\u03bc ,\n\n(G\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ) \u2192\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\nE(\u03bc\u03bd) , E[\u03bc\u03bd] .\n\n(2.31)\n\nWe can now write the most generic action using the ingredients of (2.31) and (2.30). This\nwill typically look like:\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nSgen = d2 \u03c3d2 \u03b8 a1 D+ \u03a6\u03bc \u03a8\u2212\u03bc +a2 D\u2212 \u03a6\u03bc \u03a8+\u03bc +a3 \u03a8+\u03bc \u03a8\u2212\u03bd E \u03bc\u03bd +a4 D+ \u03a6\u03bc D\u2212 \u03a6\u03bd B\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhere ai are some unknown coefficients. In writing the above action we strictly followed\n(2.30). This would explain the non\u2013existence of terms like D+ \u03a6\u03bc D\u2212 \u03a6\u03bd E\u03bc\u03bd in the action.\nIn [55] it was pointed out that that to achieve (1,1) supersymmetry, the coefficients in\n(2.32) have to be precisely\na1 = 1,\n\na2 = \u22121,\n\na3 = \u22121,\n\na4 = 1.\n\n(2.33)\n\nAbove technique therefore demonstrates a simple way to obtain a supersymmetric action\nfrom the bosonic action of [58]. The next question will is: under what conditions does\n(2.32) have (2,2) supersymmetry? Since we have already fixed the unknown coefficients\nai , the only other way is to look for target space geometry. This is exactly where the\nmathematical construction of generalized complex geometries fits in! It turns out, as was\ndiscussed by Lindstrom in [55] (see the first paper in the list), the target manifold has to\n25\n\nFor example Chern-Simons corrections.\n\n22\n\n\fbe a bi\u2013Hermitian or, equivalently, twisted generalized K\u00e4hler manifold [53] to attain the\nfull (2,2) world\u2013sheet supersymmetry.\nThe discussion how the manifolds constructed in [18] and [19] fit into this (twisted)\ngeneralized complex framework will be left for the sequel to this paper. Our aim in the\nnext section is to study the heterotic side of the story, i.e. (0,2) models. We will be able to\nprovide a full global description of the particular setup initiated in [19]. But before doing\nso, let us conclude this section by pointing out one obvious result: integrating out \u03a8\u00b1\u03bc in\n(2.32) reproduces back (2.29).\n\n3. Global Heterotic models\nIn the type II analysis in [18], [19] and above we showed that the global descriptions\nfor the geometric transition backgrounds are particularly involved. In type IIB we gave a\nlocal metric, and the global background is a K\u00e4hler manifold with additional D7 branes\nand O7 planes. On the other hand, the type IIA background is locally and globally non\u2013\nK\u00e4hler. We now want to discuss the type I/Heterotic models whose local descriptions were\npresented in [19]. These backgrounds turned out to be, not surprisingly, non\u2013K\u00e4hler (but\ncomplex) manifolds. In the following we present global descriptions of these models.\n3.1. Heterotic (0,2) models: brief discussion\nTo develop (0,2) models in the context of complex structures and not generalized\ncomplex structures, we have to go back to (2.29). In this action we have the freedom to\nadd non\u2013interacting fields. This ruins the carefully balanced (2,2) supersymmetry of this\nmodel. We can use this to our advantage by adding non\u2013interacting fields only in the\nleft\u2013moving sector. This breaks the left moving supersymmetry, and one might therefore\nhope to obtain an action for (0,2) models from (2.29), at least classically. On the other\nhand, a possible (0,2) action is also restricted because this will be the action for heterotic\nstring. It turns out, there are few allowed changes one can do to find the classical (0,2)\naction from a given (2,2) action:\n\u2022 Keep the right moving sector unchanged, i.e. \u03c8 p remain as before.\n\n\u2022 In the left moving sector, replace \u03c8 q\u0307 by eight fermions \u03a8a , a = 1, ...8. Also add 24\nadditional non\u2013interacting fermions \u03a8b , b = 9, ...32.\n\n\u2022 Replace \u03c9+ by gauge fields A, i.e. embed the torsional spin connection into the gauge\nconnection.\n\n23\n\n\fThe above set of transformations will convert the classical (2,2) action given in (2.29)\nto a classical (0,2) one. One might, however, wonder about the Bianchi identity in the\nheterotic theory. The type IIB three\u2013form fields are closed, whereas heterotic three\u2013form\nfields satisfy the Bianchi identity. One immediate reconciliation would be that because of\nthe embedding \u03c9+ = A, the heterotic three\u2013form should be closed. This may seem like an\nadmissible solution to the problem, but because of subtleties mentioned in [45], [59], [60]\nthe above embedding will not allow any compact non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifolds to appear in the\nheterotic theory. Therefore, as a first approximation, we will assume an embedding of the\nform\n\u03c9+ = A + O(\u03b1\u2032 ).\nUsing this the new action with (0,2) supersymmetry becomes:\nZ\nh\n1\n2\nS=\nd\n\u03c3\n(gij + Bij )\u2202+ X i \u2202\u2212 X j + i\u03c8 p (\u2206+ \u03c8)p + i\u03a8A (\u2206\u2212 \u03a8)A +\n8\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\ni\n1\nij\n\u03c8 p \u03c8 q \u03a8A \u03a8B + O(\u03b1\u2032 )\n+ Fij(AB) \u03c3pq\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere due to the embedding (3.1), Fija forms the Yang\u2013Mills field strength measured w.r.t.\n\na\nLie algebra matrices TAB\n. The fermion indices are A = 1, ..., 32, which means there are 32\n\nfermions, and hence T a form tensors of rank 16. The reader can easily identify the above\naction as an action for a heterotic sigma model with torsion [44], [45], [46], [61], [62], [63],\n[64]. The action of the Laplacian (2.19) changes accordingly to\ni\nB\n\u2206\u2212 \u03a8A = \u2202\u2212 \u03a8A + AAB\ni (\u2202\u2212 X ) \u03a8\n1\npq q\n\u2206+ \u03c8 p = \u2202+ \u03c8 p + (\u03c9+ )ab \u03c3ab\n\u03c8\n2\n1\nHijk = (Bij,k + Bjk,i + Bkj,i ) .\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nAs expected, this set of actions (3.3) determines the (0,1) supersymmetric heterotic sigma\nmodel [62]. This is similar to the (1,1) action for the type II case. The full (0,2) susy will\nbe determined by additional actions on the fields (exactly as for the (1,1) case before).\nThe above set of manipulations that convert a classical (2,2) action to a classical (0,2)\none will help us to understand various things about the heterotic theory using data of type\nII theories. In particular we would like to ask the following questions:\n\u2022 Can we use this to find new torsional background in heterotic theory? In [19] we provided\n\na possible background in heterotic theory which might show geometric transition. However, this background was duality chased from the orientifold corner of type IIB theory.\n24\n\n\fThis means, in particular, that quantum corrections would modify both type II as well\nas the heterotic background once we shift the type IIB background from the orientifold\npoint. Although it is possible to infer the quantum corrections to the type IIB background\n(i.e. from F-theory), the corresponding correction in the heterotic picture is not easy to\ndetermine. Therefore, using above manipulations we might be able to infer a possible\nbackground in heterotic theory that would show geometric transition.\n\u2022 From above manipulations we also observe that both metric and Bij fields can be taken to\nthe heterotic side. However, this is only possible if the original (2,2) background does not\nhave any HRR fields. In the presence of HRR the simple manipulations that we performed\ncannot give a (0,2) or a (0,1) model. We are therefore particularly interested in type\nII models that allow only for an NS three\u2013form, like MN [2]. When both NS and RR\nbackgrounds are present, it might still be possible to perform above manipulations if one\ncan find an equivalent U\u2013dual background. This U\u2013dual background will in general not\nbe K\u00e4hler (not even conformally K\u00e4hler). Observe that these U-dualities do not require\nthe original background to be at the orientifold point. This is therefore different from the\nanalysis performed in [4], [23]26 .\n\u2022 Once a particular heterotic background is found one has to address the issue of vector\n\nbundles27 . Two sets of questions arise:\n\n(a) What are the allowed vector bundles on the manifold? How do we study the stability\nof these bundles?\n(b) How do we pull bundles through a geometric transition (or conifold transition)?\nThe first issue, of the existence of the bundle, can be inferred from the detailed analysis\ngiven (at least for the U (1) case) in [46], [66]. However, the situation here may become a\n26\n\nAnother interesting question would be to allow for both NS and RR background in the S\u2013\n\ndual type I picture. This is a highly restrictive scenario as the allowed values of NS fluxes in the\nS\u2013dual type I picture are only two discrete choices [65].\n27\n\nThe vector bundles that we are interested in are a subgroup of the SO(32) bundle of the\n\nheterotic theory. In fact, there are two possible bundles here. If the proposed heterotic background\nis dual to an SU (N ) gauge theory, where N is the number of wrapped NS5 branes, then the SU (N )\ngauge group may also appear in the geometry. This would be a much more involved case. If a\ndual theory exists, we have to determine the full UV behavior of this theory. We can assume (as\nin the type II cases) that the geometric dual just describes the far IR of a much more detailed\ntheory, and \u2212 if we also assume that the theory will eventually confine \u2212 then SU (N ) will be\nbroken. This means we only have to consider SO(32) (or possibly its subgroup because of the\nembedding (3.1)). More details will follow.\n\n25\n\n\flittle simpler than the one in [46], because of the embedding (3.1). This embedding implies\nthat for a given complex structure J\n \u0304 = 0 + O(\u03b1\u2032 ) .\ni\u2202 \u2202J\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis means we can study the stability of bundles using the recent analysis of Li and Yau [67]\nand Fu and Yau [68]. The second issue, of pulling the bundles through a conifold transition,\nis important if we want to present a heterotic model that does show geometric transition.\nIn [46] it was shown how bundles can be pulled through flops. Here we would like to study\na more subtle phenomena: the analysis of the bundles after geometric transition.\n\u2022 Our manipulations can now be used to understand half\u2013twisted sigma models from type\nII twisted models. The half\u2013twist is performed only to the right moving sector of the\n\nsigma model (3.2). This was presented first in [51]. Our aim is to understand in more\ndetail the Chiral de Rham complex CDR [69]. Because of the embedding (3.1), we expect\na connection between the chiral differential operators CDO [69], [70] and the chiral de\nRham complex. This issue has also recently been addressed by Witten [33]. CDO's are\nrelevant for the study of conformal field theories for models that are twisted or half-twisted.\nTherefore, all the relevant operators in the theory are written as BRST exact operators\nw.r.t. the BRST charge Q. In this way the CFT (which is also a TFT) is different from\nthe usual CFT for string sigma models. As discussed in [33], under the embedding (3.1),\nthe CDO is then a half\u2013twisted version of a sigma model with (2,2) supersymmetry called\nthe CDR.\n3.2. Heterotic (0,2) models: detailed discussion\nTo use the sigma-model analysis that we presented in the above section, we have to\ndetermine a particular heterotic background and show that such an equivalent background\ncan also appear in the type IIB set-up. In our earlier paper [19] we provided a heterotic\nbackground that has non-trivial dilaton, metric and torsion. The explicit vielbeins for this\nbackground after geometric transition were given in [19] as:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\ne1 = (h2 + a22 h1 )\u2212 2 (C \u2032 D\u2032 )\u2212 4 (dy \u2212 byj d\u03b6 j ), e2 = (h4 + a21 h1 )\u2212 2 (C \u2032 D\u2032 )\u2212 4 (dx \u2212 bxi d\u03b6 i )\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\ne3 = \u221a (h3 h4 ) 2 (C \u2032 D\u2032 )\u2212 4 (d\u03b81 + \u03b34 d\u03b82 ), e4 = \u221a (h3 h4 ) 2 (C \u2032 D\u2032 )\u2212 4 (d\u03b81 + \u03b35 d\u03b82 )\n2\n2\n\u20321\n\n1\n\n1\n\ne5 = \u03b3 2 H 4 (C \u2032 D\u2032 )\u2212 4 dr,\n\n1\n\n1\n\ne6 = h12 (C \u2032 D\u2032 )\u2212 4 dz\n(3.5)\n26\n\n\fwhere, as one might recall from [19], the vielbeins e1 and e2 are simple because Re \u03c41 = 0,\nwhereas the vielbeins e3 and e4 contain mixed components because Re \u03c42 6= 0, where\nd\u03c71 \u2261 dx + \u03c41 dy,\n\nd\u03c72 \u2261 d\u03b81 + \u03c42 d\u03b82 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nIt was pointed out that for the background after transition the complex structure is specified by Re \u03c41 = 0, Re \u03c42 6= 0, whereas the opposite holds true for the background before\ntransition. The variables \u03b34 and \u03b35 appearing in (3.5) are defined as:\n\u03b34 = Re \u03c42 \u00b1 Im \u03c42 ,\n\n\u03b35 = Re \u03c42 \u2213 Im \u03c42\n\n(3.7)\n\nwith \u03c42 defined above in (3.6).

H is a warp factor due to D5 and D7-\n\nbranes as well as O7\u2013planes, but it was not further specified in [19]. Using the above\ndefinitions the metric after geometric transition is simply ds2 = \u03b7ab ea eb with ea = ea\u03bc dx\u03bc .\nThis is equivalent to:\nds2 = A1 dz 2 + A2 (dy \u2212 byj d\u03b6 j )2 + A3 (dx \u2212 bxi d\u03b6 i )2 + A4 |d\u03c72 |2 + A5 dr 2\n\n(3.9)\n\nwith the coefficients Ai are written in terms of hi , ai etc. as\nA2 =\n\n1\n(h2 +\n\na22 h1 )\n\nh1\n,\nA1 = \u221a\nC \u2032 D\u2032\n\n\u221a\n,\nC \u2032 D\u2032\n\nA3 =\n\nh3 h4\nA4 = \u221a\n,\nC \u2032 D\u2032\n27\n\n1\n(h4 +\n\na21 h1 )\n\n\u221a\n\u03b3\u2032 H\nA5 = \u221a\nC \u2032 D\u2032\n\n\u221a\n\nC \u2032 D\u2032\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fThe metric (3.9) is somewhat similar to the type I picture developed earlier in [19].

We need stable vector\nbundles satisfying torsional DUY equations. This will be dealt a little later. Here we make\nthe following observations:\n\u2022 In this background the dilaton is proportional to the warp factors appearing in the metric.\n\nThis is consistent with the expectations for a torsional background [44],[61],[4], [23], [45],\n[71].\n\u2022 As emphasized in [19], it could be possible that the dual background before geometric\ntransition is related to N S5 branes wrapped on two cycles of the non-K\u00e4hler manifold.\n\nThese stem from D5\u2013branes wrapped on a two cycle of a resolved conifold (which survives\nthe orientifold operation) in IIB. After the geometric transition we get a heterotic background which has only fluxes but no branes. The question here is whether we can shrink\nthe two cycle on which we have wrapped N S5 branes and get another background with\nfluxes. At a more fundamental level, can the closed string background with fluxes compute\nanything of the world volume dynamics on the wrapped N S5 branes? To get an answer\nto this question, we have to carefully study the heterotic background.\n\u2022 We would also like to give a heterotic background that is away from the orientifold\npoint (in IIB). This is a tricky question, because the U-dualities by which we obtained\n\nour heterotic background are only defined for type IIB theory at the orientifold point. To\nfind a more generic heterotic background we could rely on the sigma\u2013model derivation. It\nstates that a specific torsional background in type IIB theory may be lifted to heterotic\ntheory as long as there are no RR background fluxes. One such RR\u2013flux free background is\nknown in type IIB theory: it is the Maldacena-Nunez torsional background [2]. However,\nthis cannot be lifted naively because the three\u2013form is closed and the background has no\nvector bundles. We will show that a similar background can be found in heterotic theory\nfor some specific choices of bij in (3.9).\n28\n\n\fThe issue of vector bundles is important. It can be easily shown that the action (3.2)\nis invariant under supersymmetry transformation by a spinor \u03c3 provided\nFija \u0393[i \u0393j] = 0,\n\n\u2202\u03c3 =\n\n1 ab [b a]\n\u03c9 \u0393 \u0393 \u03c3.\n2 \u2212\n\n(3.12)\n\nThis ensures N = 1 supersymmetry for the background (3.9). Observe also the appearance\n\nof the other spin-connection \u03c9\u2212 in the susy transformations. This stems from the relation\nof the (0,2) sigma model with the (2,2) sigma model. The reader will also recognize that\nthe first condition in (3.12) is J ij Fija = 0 for a fundamental form Jij that is covariantly\nconstant with respect to a connection with torsion.\nAt this point one can also entertain the following puzzle: if the metric (3.9) is related\nto some wrapped NS5 branes in the dual theory, then two different theories on the NS5\n+\nbranes seem possible: a (2,0) theory with self-dual B\u03bc\u03bd\nfield28 and a (1,1) gauge theory. It\n\nturns out that U-dualities from type IIB background always lead to the (1,1) theory and\nnot the (2,0) theory29 .\nWe now turn to the issue of finding a heterotic metric away from the type IIB orientifold limit. First, we see that the metric (3.9) can be re\u2013written in the following way:\nds2 =A1 dz 2 + A2 dy 2 + A3 dx2 + A4 |d\u03c72 |2 + A2 b2yj (d\u03b6 j )2 +\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ A3 b2xi (d\u03b6 i )2 \u2212 2 A2 byj dy d\u03b6 j + A3 bxi dx d\u03b6 i\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere \u03b6 i = \u03b8i are the coordinates along angular directions. We allow for a generic choice\nof type IIB BNS fields at the orientifold point given by:\nb = bx\u03b81 dx \u2227 d\u03b81 + bx\u03b82 dx \u2227 d\u03b82 + by\u03b81 dy \u2227 d\u03b81 + by\u03b82 dy \u2227 d\u03b82 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nApparently, this choice of BNS field is more generic than the one for the type IIB background in [19]. Does the type IIB theory allow such a choice of BNS field? For an arbitrary\nchoice of type IIB metric the answer is of course no. However, using the construction in\n[19], we see that the type IIB geometry at the orientifold point is T 2 \u00d7 T 2 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 R, with R\n\nbeing the direction parameterized by dr 2 . It was shown in [19] that this kind of type IIB\n28\n\nThis is the world volume B + field, and shouldn't be confused with heterotic torsion.\n\n29\n\nThe (2,0) theory on the other hand can be derived directly from M-theory on an interval a-la\n\nHorava\u2013Witten [72]. In fact SO(32) heterotic theory yields a (1,1) five\u2013brane theory and E8 \u00d7 E8\ngives the (2,0) theory [73],[74].\n\n29\n\n\fgeometry and a BNS field with choice (bx\u03b81 , by\u03b82 ) only, requires the two T 2 tori (\u03c71 , \u03c72 ) in\n(3.6) to have the following complex structures (after geometric transition):\ns\n\n\u03c41 = i\n\nh2 + a22 h1\n,\nh4 + a21 h1\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\n1\n2\n2\n2\na1 a2 h1 + i h2 h3 h4 \u2212 a1 a2 h1 .\n\u03c42 =\nh3 h4\n\n(3.15)\n\nWe see that one of the tori is a square torus, whereas the other is not. Such a compactification is a non\u2013compact version of T 6 flux compactifications studied in [4], [23]30 . Therefore\nit allows for all possible fluxes that are invariant under orbifold and orientifold actions.\nThe choice of BNS field (3.14) is clearly invariant under such actions, and is therefore a\nvalid choice for the IIB background.\nWe now focus on relating the heterotic background (3.13) from [19] to a background\nsimilar to Maldacena\u2013Nunez with the metric of a deformed conifold and BNS field, but no\nRR\u2013flux. A first step would be to achieve a metric with two square tori, accompanied by\nan appropriate change in fluxes. Here we will assume that we can consistently employ the\nother choice of IIB BNS in (3.14), i.e\nb = bx\u03b82 dx \u2227 d\u03b82 + by\u03b81 dy \u2227 d\u03b81\n\n(3.16)\n\nalong with the \u03c72 torus in the heterotic metric (3.13) converted to a square one. The\nsupersymmetry of the background will be restored by a modified type IIB BRR field, so\nthat both (\u03c71 , \u03c72 ) tori are now square.\nOnce we change BRR in type IIB, the heterotic torsion will change completely from the\none in (3.11). Similarly the coefficients in the metric (3.13) will have to be re\u2013evaluated.\nThe question is if we can determine a valid torsional background now31 .\nIn the following we will show that the metric and the torsion can be determined to\nsatisfy the torsional relation from the superpotential [75], [76], [77]\nH = e2\u03c6 \u2217 d e\u22122\u03c6 J\n\n\u0001\n\n(3.17)\n\nwith the dilaton \u03c6, the torsion H and the fundamental 2-form J. Alternatively, once we\nknow a particular metric - and the dilaton from the warp factors - the torsion can be\n30\n\nAny orientifold action will not be visible in the metric as each of these terms are invariant\n\nunder any such actions.\n31\n\nThe dilaton will be determined from the warp factors in the metric.\n\n30\n\n\fevaluated via (3.17). We will also be able to infer possible deviation of the metric that\nwould lead to N = 2 spacetime supersymmetry.\n\nOur starting metric is (3.13), where we account for the changes made to BNS (3.16)\n\nand the complex structure of the \u03c72 torus by letting the coefficients Ai be arbitrary. Let\n\u03c42 = i|\u03c4 | in (3.6). The choice (3.16) leads to dy d\u03b81 and dx d\u03b82 cross\u2013terms in the metric.\nRequiring those to have the same prefactor can be achieved by\nA3 = A2 by\u03b81 b\u22121\nx\u03b82 .\n\n(3.18)\n\nFurthermore imposing equal prefactors on dy 2 and d\u03b822 leads to\nA4 = |\u03c4 |\u22122 A2 (1 \u2212 by\u03b81 bx\u03b82 ) .\n\n(3.19)\n\nAfter that the metric becomes:\nh\n\u0001\n2\n\u22122\nds2 = A1 dz 2 + A2 (dy 2 + d\u03b822 ) + by\u03b81 * b\u22121\n\u2212 |\u03c4 |\u22122 by\u03b81 * bx\u03b82 + b2y\u03b81 d\u03b812\nx\u03b82 dx + |\u03c4 |\ni\n\u2212 2 by\u03b81 (dy d\u03b81 + dx d\u03b82 ) + A5 dr 2 + ds20123 .\n\n(3.20)\n\n2\n\nIf we furthermore restrict also dx and\n\nd\u03b812\n\nto have equal coefficients, the b field becomes\n\n\u0012\n\nbx\u03b82 = |\u03c4 |2 by\u03b81\n\nconstrained, too:\nA3\n\nA2\n=\n,\n|\u03c4 |2\n\nA4 = A2\n\n\u0013\n1\n2\n\u2212 by\u03b81 ,\n|\u03c4 |2\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere A1 is still arbitrary. The final metric, after we do all these substitutions, becomes\n\nh\ni\n1\nds2 = A5 dr 2 +A1 dz 2 +A2 (dy 2 +d\u03b822 )+ 2 (dx2 +d\u03b812 )\u22122 by\u03b81 (dy d\u03b81 + dx d\u03b82 ) (3.22)\n|\u03c4 |\n\nalong with flat Minkowski spacetime. To bring (3.21) into some familiar form, we perform\nthe following set of transformations:\ny \u2192 sin h\u03c8i y + cos h\u03c8i \u03b82\n\u03b82 \u2192 \u2212cos h\u03c8i y + sin h\u03c8i \u03b82\n\n(3.23)\n\nz \u2192 z + a1 cot h\u03b81 i x + b1 cot h\u03b82 i y\nwith (\u03b81 , x, r) remaining unchanged. We have also denoted the expectation values of the\nangles as h\u0398i, with \u0398 = (\u03b82 , \u03c8, \u03b81) and a1 , b1 are constants. Furthermore, in our notation\nd\u03c8 is related to dz (see sec. 5 of [18] for notations).\n31\n\n\fThe metric (3.22), after inserting in the set of transformations (3.23), takes the following form:\nds\n\n2\n\n\u0010\n\u00112\nh\ni\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n= A1 dz + a1 cot h\u03b81 i dx + b1 cot h\u03b82 i dy + A2 (dy + d\u03b82 ) + 2 (dx + d\u03b81 ) +\n|\u03c4 |\nh\ni\n\u2212 2 A2 by\u03b81 sin h\u03c8i(dy d\u03b81 + dx d\u03b82 ) + cos h\u03c8i(d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx dy) + A5 dr 2 .\n(3.24)\n\nOne observes that for non\u2013constant \u0398, the metric will be exactly a warped deformed\nconifold32 . In the following we will therefore try to answer the following questions:\n\u2022 When can we have non-constant \u0398?\n\u2022 What is the background dilaton?\n\u2022 What will be the torsion for this background?\n\u2022 What are the stable vector bundles allowed for such a torsional background?\nAnother related question would be to ask for the allowed deformations of the above metric\n(3.24) that would preserve N = 2 supersymmetry. Of course once we make \u0398 non-constant,\n\nboth dilaton and torsion will have to change so that the background still preserves N = 1\n\nsupersymmetry. Therefore deforming away from N = 1 supersymmetry should be non\u2013\n\ntrivial.\nComing back to the metric (3.24), we see that (3.24) has a close relation with\nMaldacena\u2013Nunez (MN) N = 1 supergravity solution. The MN solution [2] is a warped\n\ndeformed conifold, with the metric taking the following form33 :\n\n\u00112\nN\u0010\nd\u03c8 + cos \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c62 +\n4\n\u0011 N\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0010\nN 2g\nd\u03b8\u030312 + sin2 \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c621 +\ne + a2 d\u03b8\u030322 + sin2 \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c622 +\n+\n4\n4\ni\nNah\ncos \u03c8(d\u03b8\u03031 d\u03b8\u03032 \u2212 sin \u03b8\u03031 sin \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c61 d\u03c62 ) + sin \u03c8(sin \u03b8\u03031 d\u03c61 d\u03b8\u03032 + sin \u03b8\u03032 d\u03c62 d\u03b8\u03031 )\n\u2212\n2\n(3.25)\n\nds2MN = N dr 2 +\n\n32\n\nThis doesn't mean that the metric will be conformally Ricci-flat. By warped deformed conifold\n\nwe mean generic warping and not just conformally warped. We will soon distinguish between the\nvarious possible warpings allowed in these set-ups.\n33\n\nThe metric written in [2] uses left-invariant one-forms. One can easily show the following\n\nresult by writing the metric in components.\n\n32\n\n\fwhere we have used (\u03b8\u03031 , \u03b8\u03032 ) in (3.25) to distinguish it from (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) used in (3.24). In fact\nto see the relation between (3.25) and (3.24) we have to use local coordinates. Let us\ntherefore use the following substitutions:\n\u03c8 = h\u03c8i + z, \u03b8\u03031 = h\u03b81 i + \u03b81 , \u03b8\u03032 = h\u03b82 i + \u03b82\ny\nx\n,\n\u03c62 = h\u03c62 i +\n\u03c61 = h\u03c61 i +\nsin h\u03b81 i\nsin h\u03b82 i\n\n(3.26)\n\nalong with the following definitions for a and g (we follow the notation of [28]):\na(r) = \u2212\n\n2r\n,\nsinh 2r\n\ne2g = 4r coth 2r \u2212\n\n4r 2\n\u22121\nsinh2 2r\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhich are in fact necessary to make (3.25) a solution to the string equation of motion.\nRecall however that the MN solution (3.25) is a metric in type IIB theory with closed\nthree\u2013form field HNS and non\u2013trivial dilaton. This solution has vanishing HRR , axion and\nfive\u2013form. To establish the connection between (3.25) and (3.24), let us substitute (3.26)\nin (3.25) letting (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , x, y) \u2192 0. Under these assumptions (3.25) takes the following form\n(ignoring numerical factors of\nds2MN\n\nN\n4\n\nfor simplicity):\n\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0001\n= dz + cot h\u03b81 i dx + cot h\u03b82 i dy + e2g + a2 (dy 2 + d\u03b822 ) + (dx2 + d\u03b812 ) +\nh\ni\n\u2212 2 a sin h\u03c8i(dy d\u03b81 + dx d\u03b82 ) + cos h\u03c8i(d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx dy) + 4 dr 2 + ......\n(3.28)\n\nwhere the dotted terms are corrections that are higher orders in (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , x, y).\nComparing (3.28) with our metric (3.24), we see that they are of the same form up\nto higher order corrections on (3.28). Therefore one might be tempted to conjecture that\ndeforming away from the point (h\u03b81,2 i, h\u03c61,2 i) should give the global description of the\n\nheterotic metric (3.24). One possible solution for the coefficients Ai in (3.24) (or in (3.13))\nthat allows for non-constant \u0398 would then be:\nN\nA5\n= ,\nA1 = A3 =\n4\n4\n\nN (e2g + a2 )\nA2 =\n,\n4\n\nwhere we have re\u2013introduced the numerical factor of\n\nN\n4.\n\nN e2g\nA4 = 2g\ne + a2\n\n(3.29)\n\nFinally, the type IIB BNS field\n\nand the (\u03c71 , \u03c72 ) tori will have the following form:\nb = a dx \u2227 d\u03b82 +\nd\u03c71 = dx + i dy,\n\na\ndy \u2227 d\u03b81\n+ a2\np\nd\u03c72 = d\u03b81 + i e2g + a2 d\u03b82 .\n\ne2g\n\n33\n\n(3.30)\n\n\fUnder the above choices of coefficients, our metric (3.24) agrees exactly with the MN\nmetric (3.25). Of course we should remind the readers that we have not yet derived the\ncoefficients of (3.24) from our duality chain. We haven't identified a dual background\nbefore geometric transition that would allow us to do so. So (3.29) is simply a possibility\nat this point (albeit a strong one).\nIt is also worth mentioning that the MN background was derived for the IR regime\n(for small r). The same is true for our local IIB metric. However, once we infer the local\nheterotic metric and then lift it to a global background, there is no a\u2013priori restriction to\nbe in the IR. Our global solution should be valid for UV as well, but since MN fails in this\nregime, we will not specify the coefficients in the global metric. The UV limit for the MN\nbackground has been found in [28] and we will come back to this issue later.\nIn the case where the coefficients Ai in (3.24) are different from the one considered\n\nin (3.29), our ansatz would be the global form of the metric (3.24) with non\u2013constant \u0398.\nThe heterotic metric is finally given by:\n\u0001\n2\nds2het = ds20123 + A1 (d\u03c8 + a1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + b1 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) + A3 d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 +\nh\n\u0001\n+ A2 d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 \u2212 2 A2 by\u03b81 cos \u03c8 (d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 d\u03c62 )+\ni\n+ sin \u03c8 (sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 d\u03b82 + sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 d\u03b81 ) + A5 dr 2\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere (\u03c8, \u03b81,2, \u03c61,2 ) are the global coordinates; and we have kept the warp factors Ai\n\narbitrary. Notice that the above metric written in terms of global coordinates has a lesser\nnumber of isometries than (3.24) written in terms of local coordinates. In fact (3.24) is\na T 3 fibration over a three\u2013dimensional base, i.e in SYZ [20] form, whereas (3.31) cannot\nbe brought into SYZ\u2013form at all. This observation may also resolve one puzzle regarding\nmirror transformation of a resolved or deformed conifold. The resolved conifold has a\nnatural T 3 torus built inside it irrespective of whether we use global or local coordinates.\nOn the other hand a deformed conifold is not a T 3 fibration over a three dimensional\nbase. But when we use local coordinates to write the metric of a deformed conifold, we\nregain some of the isometries, and then a SYZ\u2013form for the deformed conifold can be\nwritten. This is precisely the reason for the success of the duality chain proposed in [18]\nand [19]. Since this duality chain involves T\u2013dualities, it seems impossible that one could\nloose isometries along the way. Thus, the metrics of [18], [19] all have three isometries in\nterms of local coordinates used therein. This is perfectly consistent with the arguments in\nthis article.\n34\n\n\fThe above metric (3.31) is another example of a warped deformed conifold. When\nthe warp factors Ai are different from (3.29) this metric does not coincide with the MN\nmetric (3.25). We should now compare this with other available warped\u2013deformed\u2013conifold\nsolutions:\n\u2022 The Klebanov-Strassler (KS) metric of [1], and\n\n\u2022 The Geometric transition dual metric of [19], [18].\nBoth of these are in type IIB theory with background NS and RR fluxes. Furthermore\nwhereas the KS solution [1] is written in terms of global coordinates (\u03c8, \u03b81,2, \u03c61,2 , r), the\nsolution presented in [19], [18] are written only in terms of local coordinates (z, x, y, \u03b81,2).\nThe full global picture involves seven branes and orientifold planes, as discussed earlier.\nTo compare all the different pictures, let us cite the metric of a simple (i.e. Ricci\u2013flat)\ndeformed conifold [78], [79], [80]:\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(d\u03c8\n+\ncos\n\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n+\ncos\n\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n)\n+\nK\ncosh\n\u03c1\nd\u03b8\n+\nsin\n\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n+\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n3K 2\nh\n\u0001\n+ K cosh \u03c1 d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 \u2212 2K cos \u03c8 (d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 d\u03c61 d\u03c62 )+\ni\n2\nd\u03c12\n+ sin \u03c8 (sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 d\u03b82 + sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 d\u03b81 ) +\n3K 2\n(3.32)\n\nds2DC =\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the \"radial\" coordinate, and K = K(\u03c1) =\n\n(sinh 2\u03c1\u22122\u03c1)1/3\n21/3 sinh \u03c1\n\n(see [78], [1], [79],\n\n[80] for more details). The metric (3.32) shows the same warp factors for the two spheres\nparameterized by (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) and (\u03b82 , \u03c62 ). So does the KS solution [1]. On the other hand,\nall the other solutions, Maldacena-Nunez (3.25), the geometric transition solutions of [19],\n[18], and the heterotic solution (3.31) have different warp factors for the two spheres (or\nthe two tori in case of [19], [18]). For example, the IIB solution for gravity dual presented\nin [19] is given (in local coordinates) by:\nds2IIB = h1 (dz + a1 dx + a2 dy)2 + h2 (dy 2 + d\u03b822 ) + h4 (dx2 + h3 d\u03b812 ) +\n\u221a\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ h5 sin \u03c8 (dx d\u03b82 + dy d\u03b81 ) + cos \u03c8 (d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx dy) + \u03b3 \u2032 H dr 2\n(3.33)\n\nwhere hi and ai were defined in (3.8). The global picture for this solution has not been\nworked out yet. But comparing locally shows that the solution of [19], i.e. (3.33), forms\na new class of supergravity dual with markedly different warping behavior of a deformed\n\nconifold metric. This results from the different, more elaborate set-up of [19] and [18]\ncompared to [1] and [2].\n35\n\n\fWe still have to determine the torsion for our background (3.31), where we will use\n(3.29) since we know it results in a valid background in terms of global coordinates34 .\nWe need the fundamental 2\u2013form J in terms of vielbeins ei and the dilaton. Since the\nbackground has changed, the vielbeins are not those in (3.5). Instead we choose:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nN g\nN\n5\n2\n1\ne d\u03b82 , e =\n(d\u03c8 + cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )\ne = N dr, e =\n2\n2\n\u221a\nN\n3\n(sin \u03c8 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 + cos \u03c8 d\u03b81 \u2212 a d\u03b82 )\ne =\n2\u221a\ni\nN h g\ne4 = \u2212\nB e sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 + A(cos \u03c8 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03c8 d\u03b81 + a sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 )\n\u221a2 h\ni\nN\nA eg sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2212 B(cos \u03c8 sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03c8 d\u03b81 + a sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 )\ne6 = \u2212\n2\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhich gives rise to the metric (3.31) with Ai defined as in (3.29). It was pointed out in [28]\n\nthat these are the correct vielbeins for observing the SU (3) structure of this background\nand they were first given in [81]. They are not quite those of the deformed conifold since\n\nour background (3.31), as noted earlier, is neither a Ricci\u2013flat deformed nor a conformally\ndeformed conifold35 .

The derivation would be\nequivalent, the appropriate coefficients for the vielbeins can be found in [28].\n35\n\nAlthough not a conformally deformed conifold, our model will have many of the characteristic\nfeatures of a deformed conifold as can be seen from (3.31). For example there will be a threecycle that can undergo a geometric transition. The three cycle will also have a similar Hopffibration structure as a deformed conifold. This is clear from the d\u03c8 fibration structure of (3.31).\nThese similarities will be exploited in the next section to study the vector bundles across conifold\ntransitions.\n\n36\n\n\fFrom the value of J one can easily see that the manifold is non-K\u00e4hler. This is of course\nexpected because the local metric is also non-K\u00e4hler with torsion. The background dilaton\ncan be extracted from the warped metric (3.31) or from [2], [81], and is given by\n2\u03a6\n\ne\n\neg+2\u03a60\n=\nsinh 2r\n\n(3.37)\n\nwhere \u03a60 is some constant value that could be fixed from the U\u2013dual type IIB background.\nWith the dilaton (3.37) one computes\n\u22122\u03a6\n\nd(e\n\n\u22122\u03a6\n\nJ) = e\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u22122\ndr \u2227 J + dJ .\n\u2202r\n\n(3.38)\n\nThe Hodge dual of this expression is most easily found in terms of vielbeins, since in a\nnon\u2013coordinate basis simply:\n\u2217 (e\u03b11 \u2227 e\u03b12 \u2227 e\u03b13 ) =\n\n1 \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03bc1\n\u01eb\n\u2227 e\u03bc2 \u2227 e\u03bc3 .\n\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 e\n3!\n\n(3.39)\n\nWe choose the orientation so that \u01eb123456 = 1.

More\ndetails on this will be presented elsewhere.\n\n37\n\n\fThe 3\u2013form (3.40) is the torsion for our background (3.31) with dilaton (3.37).

At this point the attentive reader might question the existence of torsion\nand warped solution from the point of view of [59], [60], [45]. We seem to have used an\nembedding where \u03c9+ = A, i.e. the gauge connection A is embedded in the torsional spin\nconnection, and not the one of (3.1). We hasten to point out that this is justified as long as\nthe underlying manifold is non\u2013compact. For compact non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifolds the situation\nis much more subtle and delicate as was pointed out in the series of papers [45], [75], [46].\nTo complete the analysis of the proposed heterotic background (3.31) with torsion (3.42)\nand dilaton (3.37) we need to consider two more issues:\n\u2022 The existence of vector bundles, and\n\n\u2022 The global behavior of by\u03b81 , bx\u03b82 and |\u03c4 |.\nThe vector bundles will be studied in the next section. Here we concentrate on the behavior\nof by\u03b81 and bx\u03b82 . In the process we will also be able to study the complex structure |\u03c4 | in\ndetail.\n\nThe global behavior of type IIB B\u2013fields by\u03b81 and bx\u03b82 can only be determined after we\nsolve the background equation of motions. However, the situation is complicated because\nof the additional seven branes and orientifold planes. That was one of the motivations for\nusing local coordinates in the first place, because we lack the global metric in IIB.\n38\n\n\fNevertheless, the global behavior of the IIB B\u2013fields can be extracted from the relation\nbetween type IIB and heterotic picture. Recall that the global heterotic metric (3.31)\ncontains the global IIB B\u2013fields, and was obtained by connecting the local pictures in\nboth theories and then using the similarity of the heterotic metric with Maldacena-Nunez\n[2] to obtain the global picture. In our case of interest, a background with only NS flux,\nwe know MN to be a valid solution in the IR. Comparing (3.31) with the MN metric\ndetermines B 37 . For small r:\n14\n2\nbx\u03b82 = \u22121 + r 2 \u2212 r 4 + O(r 6 )\n3\n45\n10 2 446 4\nr + O(r 6 )\nby\u03b81 = \u22121 + r \u2212\n3\n45\n\n(3.43)\n\nNear r \u2192 0 both B\u2013field components are constant as one might have expected. Having\n\ndetermined the B field we can also fix the \u03c72 -torus in (3.6). The complex structure is\ngiven as\n\n8\n32\n|\u03c4 |2 = 1 + r 2 \u2212 r 4 + O(r 6 )\n3\n45\n\n(3.44)\n\nwhich tells us how the (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) torus varies as we move along the radial direction. In fact,\nnear r \u2192 0: \u03c42 \u2261 i|\u03c4 | = i which, along with \u03c41 = i, completely specifies the IR behavior in\n\nIIB.\n\nThe discussion in [2] does not extend to the UV regime. Here we can rely on the\nanalysis of [28] which embeds the MN background in a class of interpolating solutions\nbetween MN and KS. Using their results we can obtain the large r behavior of the B\u2013\nfields:\nbx\u03b82 = \u22122 e\u22122r + auv (2r \u2212 1) e\u2212\n\u22122r\n\nby\u03b81 = \u22122 e\n\n10r\n3\n\n\u2212 10r\n3\n\n\u2212 auv (2r \u2212 1) e\n\n14r\n1 2\nauv (2r \u2212 1)2 e\u2212 3 + O(e\u22126r )\n2\n14r\n1 2\n\u2212 auv (2r \u2212 1)2 e\u2212 3 + O(e\u22126r )\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhere auv = \u2212\u221e corresponds to MN in the interpolating scenario. The complex structure\n\nthen results in\n\n4r\n\n|\u03c4 |2 = 1 + 2 e\u22124r \u2212 auv (2r \u2212 1) e\u2212 3 +\n\n1 2\n8r\n16r\nauv (2r \u2212 1)2 e\u2212 3 + O(e\u2212 3 ).\n2\n\n(3.46)\n\nNotice that for r \u2192 \u221e the B\u2013fields vanish and the complex structure approaches again\n\n\u03c42 = i and \u03c41 = i.\n37\n\nOne might as well solve the heterotic equations of motion (see also [28]).\n\n39\n\n\fThis finalizes the study of the heterotic background (3.31). Before we move on to\nstudy vector bundles we would like to comment on possible deformations to N = 2 susy.\nLet us go back and consider (3.20), written in terms of local coordinates. We have already\nobserved that in this metric the relative coefficients of dy 2 and d\u03b822 are the same, whereas\nthe relative coefficients of dx2 and d\u03b812 are different. Instead of requiring the latter also to\nbe equal let us keep them inhomogeneous. We furthermore assume that the B\u2013fields go to\nzero in the following way:\nby\u03b81\n\n\u2192 g1 \u01eb,\n\nbx\u03b82\n\n\u2192 g2 \u01eb\n\n(3.47)\n\nwith \u01eb approaching zero. Under this requirement the ratio of by\u03b81 and bx\u03b82 approaches\nby\u03b81\nbx\u03b82\n\n=\n\ng1\ng2\n\nalthough individually they are very small everywhere. Using (3.47) and the\n\ncoordinate transformation (3.23) we obtain the following local form of the metric in the\nlimit \u01eb \u2192 0:\n\n\u0010\n\u00112\nds2 = A1 dz + a1 cot h\u03b81 i dx + b1 cot h\u03b82 i dy + A2 (dy 2 + d\u03b822 ) +\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng1\n1\n2\n2\n+ A2\ndx + 2 d\u03b81 + A5 dr 2 + ds20123\ng2\n|\u03c4 |\n\n(3.48)\n\nwhere Ai can be generic functions of the local coordinates, and a1 , b1 are constants38 . If\nwe set a1 = 0, b1 = 1, we arrive at a metric that is the local form of the N = 2 metric\nstudied by [82]. We can therefore conjecture our metric (3.48) to have the global form\n(recall (3.26) for the relation between local and global coordinates):\n\u0010\n\u00112\nds2 = A1 d\u03c8 + cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 + A2 (d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 ) +\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ng1\n2\n2\n2\n+ A2\nd\u03b8 +\nsin \u03b81 d\u03c61 + A5 dr 2 + ds20123 .\n|\u03c4 |2 1 g2\n\n(3.49)\n\nTo determine the precise values of the various coefficients we can compare (3.49) to the\nN = 2 metric of [82] (see also [83]):\n\u0010\n\u00112\ne\u2212x\n2\ncos\n\u03b8\nd\u03c8\n+\ncos\n\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n+ F (r) (d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 ) +\n1\n2\n2\ngc2 \u03a9\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2202F\nex\n2\n2\n2\n2 2x\n+ F (r)\ndr 2\nd\u03b8 +\nsin \u03b81 d\u03c61 + gc e\ngc2 F (r) 1 \u03a9 gc2 F (r)\n\u2202r\n\nds2 = ds20123 +\n\n38\n\nFor N = 1 case studied earlier, a1 = b1 = 1.\n\n40\n\n(3.50)\n\n\fwhere gc is the coupling constant and F (r) is a function of the radial coordinate r [82].\nThe other two variables, \u03a9 and ex are defined in terms of the coordinates, gc , F (r) and an\nintegration constant \u03ba, as (see [82] for derivations):\n2\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\u2212x\n\n\u03a9 = e cos \u03b81 + e\n\n2\n\nsin \u03b81 ,\n\n\u22122x\n\ne\n\n1 + \u03ba e\u22122gc F\n= 1\u2212\n2gc2 F.\n\n(3.51)\n\nComparing (3.49) and (3.50), it is obvious that with the correct identifications of the\ncoefficients Ai and g1 , g2 , |\u03c4 | we can obtain an N = 2 deformation of our background (3.31).\nThe appropriate dilaton \u03a6 and torsion H for this case have already been considered in [82]\n\nand therefore we will not re\u2013derive the torsion for this background. The interested reader\nmay find all the details in [82].\nOne final comment on the metrics (3.49) and (3.50): Notice that the relative coefficients of d\u03b812 and sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 are different. This is reminiscent of a similar behavior that we\nencountered for the type IIB N = 1 metric (3.33) (see also [19] for derivation). In (3.33)\nthe local metric showed equal coefficients for (dy, d\u03b82) but different relative coefficients for\n(dx, d\u03b81 ). Since we encounter the same behavior for the N = 2 case herein, this might\n\nbe an indication that the metric (3.33) actually shows N = 2 supersymmetry, and only\nthe NS and RR fluxes break the supersymmetry to N = 1. If the above statement is\n\ntrue (we have not verified this yet) this would be perfectly consistent with the predictions\n\nfor geometric transitions considered in [84], [9], [12], [11], [14], [13], [15], [10] where it was\nclearly stated that the underlying manifolds preserve N = 2 supersymmetry and the fluxes\nbreak susy from N = 2 to N = 1.\n\n4. Pulling Rank 2 vector bundles through conifold transitions\nIn the previous subsection we gave a detailed construction of a heterotic background\non a manifold that resembles a warped deformed conifold. To complete the story we need\nto study vector bundles on the manifold, and also discuss how the bundles are pulled\nthrough conifold transitions. In the following therefore we will address these questions in\nsome detail.\nSince the analysis will involve some mathematics that might not be too well-known\nto physicists, we will start by discussing some standard facts about rank 2 vector bundles.\nFor simplicity of exposition, we specialize to vector bundles on Calabi-Yau threefolds.\n41\n\n\f4.1. The Serre construction\nConsider a holomorphic rank 2 vector bundle E on a Calabi-Yau threefold X satisfying\nanomaly cancellation. Pick a holomorphic section s \u2208 H 0 (X, E), and suppose that the set\n\nof zeros of s is a smooth complex curve C \u2282 X.39 Multiplication and wedging by s gives\nan exact sequence\n\n0 \u2192 OX \u2192 OX (E) \u2192 OX (detE).\nHere and in the sequel, OX (E) as usual denotes the sheaf of holomorphic sections of the\n\nvector bundle E. The notion of a sheaf gives a framework for simultaneously discussing\nsections over arbitrary open sets.\n\nNote that detE is the trivial bundle by the condition c1 (E) = 0, so we can rewrite\nthe above as\n0 \u2192 OX \u2192 OX (E) \u2192 OX .\nThe sections in the image of the rightmost map clearly vanish on C. Denoting the sheaf of\nfunctions vanishing on C by IC ,40 the above exact sequence induces a short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 OX \u2192 OX (E) \u2192 IC \u2192 0.\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe Serre construction allows us to reverse this process to give a construction of E\nfrom C and some extra data. The Serre construction is explained in [85].\nThe exact sequence (4.1) describes OX (E) as an extension of IC by OX . Such exten-\n\nsions are classified by the Ext group Ext1 (IC , OX ). There are the same groups as have\nappeared in the physics literature in describing open string states at large radius.\nExt groups enjoy a number of properties, explained in [85].\n\u2022 If E and F are any sheaves, then Ext0 (E, F ) \u2243 Hom(E, F ).\n\n\u2022 If E is a vector bundle and F is any sheaf, then Exti (O(E), F ) \u2243 H i (X, O(E \u2217 ) \u2297 F ).\n\n\u2022 If 0 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E \u2192 E2 \u2192 0 is a short exact sequence of sheaves and F is any sheaf, then\nthere are long exact sequences\n\n* * * \u2192 Exti (E2 , F ) \u2192 Exti (E, F ) \u2192 Exti (E1 , F ) \u2192 Exti+1 (E2 , F ) \u2192 * * *\n39\n\nThe existence of such a section is in a sense not really a restrictive assumption. If O(1)\n\nas usual denotes the hyperplane bundle on X given by the realization of X in some IPn , then\nE \u2297 O(N ) admits such a section for N sufficiently large.\n40\n\nWarning: IC is not a line bundle.\n\n42\n\n\fand\n* * * \u2192 Exti (F , E1) \u2192 Exti (F , E) \u2192 Exti (F , E2 ) \u2192 Exti+1 (F , E1 ) \u2192 * * *\nThe ideal sheaf IC fits into the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 IC \u2192 OX \u2192OC \u2192 0,\nwhere the last nontrivial map is the restriction map. It follows that the desired Ext group\nExt1 (IC , OX ) fits into the short exact sequence\nExt1 (OX , OX ) \u2192 Ext1 (IC , OX ) \u2192 Ext2 (OC , OX ) \u2192 Ext2 (OX , OX ).\nBy the properties of Ext, we have that Exti (OX , OX ) \u2243 H i (X, OX ). But H 1 (X, OX ) =\nH 1 (X, OX ) = 0 for Calabi-Yau threefolds. We conclude that\nExt1 (IC , OX ) \u2243 Ext2 (OC , OX ).\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe now need some mathematical results which generalize Serre duality and the adjunction formula. For this, we first need to introduce local Exts. As a preliminary, we discuss\nthe case of Ext0 first, i.e. Hom. Given bundles E and F , we have the group Hom(E, F ),\nbut we also have a local version, namely the bundle E \u2217 \u2297 F . In sheaf language, we would\n\nwrite the sheaf Hom(O(E), O(F )), which is nothing but the sheaf O(E \u2217 \u2297 F ). This is the\n\nsame thing as Ext0 (O(E), O(F )) by definition. The connection between local and global\nHom (or equivalently Ext0 ) is\n\nH 0 (X, Hom(O(E), O(F ))) \u2243 Hom(O(E), O(F )).\nAn analogous equality is true for arbitrary sheaves which are not necessarily the sheaves\nof sections of a holomorphic vector bundle.\nGiven sheaves E, F , we have the local Ext sheaves Exti (E, F ). These enjoy several\n\nproperties, some analogous to the properties of Ext groups. These properties are all\nexplained in [85].\n\u2022 If E and F are vector bundles, then Ext0 (O(E), O(F )) \u2243 O(E \u2217 \u2297 F ).\n\n\u2022 If E is a vector bundle and F is any sheaf, then Exti (O(E), F ) = 0 for i > 0. This is a\n\nlocal version of a corresponding property for Ext groups, since higher cohomology vanishes\non disks.\n43\n\n\f\u2022 If 0 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E \u2192 E2 \u2192 0 is a short exact sequence of sheaves and F is any sheaf, then\nthere are long exact sequences of sheaves\n\n* * * \u2192 Exti (E2 , F ) \u2192 Exti (E, F ) \u2192 Exti (E1 , F ) \u2192 Exti+1 (E2 , F ) \u2192 * * *\nand\n* * * \u2192 Exti (F , E1) \u2192 Exti (F , E) \u2192 Exti (F , E2 ) \u2192 Exti+1 (F , E1 ) \u2192 * * *\nBut it is not the case that H 0 (X, Exti (O(E), O(F ))) \u2243 Exti (O(E), O(F )) for i > 0.\n\nInstead there is a more complicated relation between local and global Ext groups described\n\nby a spectral sequence. Rather than beginning a lengthy digression into the formalism of\nspectral sequences, we content ourselves with a simple consequence which suffices for our\npurposes.\n\u2022 If E, F are sheaves and Extj (E, F ) = 0 for j < i, then H 0 (X, Exti (O(E), O(F ))) \u2243\nExti (O(E), O(F )).\n\nWe now apply this to duality. We have, as explained in [86],\ni\n\nExt (OC , OX ) \u2243\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03a91C\n0\n\ni=2\ni<2\n\nSo the final bullet above applies, and we conclude that\nExt1 (IC , OX ) \u2243 Ext2 (OC , OX ) \u2243 H 0 (C, \u03a91C ).\nPutting this all together, E can be recovered from the curve C and a holomorphic 1-form\non C.\nNow let C be an arbitrary smooth curve and \u03c9 a holomorphic 1-form on C. Reversing\nthe above construction, we get an extension\n0 \u2192 OX \u2192 E \u2192 IC \u2192 0\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhose extension class in Ext1 (IC , OX ) corresponds to \u03c9 under the above isomorphisms.\n\nWe cannot conclude that E is a vector bundle, only that it is a sheaf. Furthermore, a local\n\ncalculation shows that E fails to be (the sheaf of sections of) a vector bundle precisely at\n\nthe points of C where \u03c9 vanishes. If C is a smooth curve of genus g and \u03c9 is not identically\nzero, then there are 2g \u2212 2 such points (including multiplicity).\n44\n\n\fWe conclude that we get a vector bundle only for g = 1. But as elliptic curves are\nabundant on Fano or Calabi-Yau threefolds B, we learn that rank 2 bundles are straightforward to construct on these threefolds.\nWe now have to satisfy anomaly cancellation, which we presume to be of the form\nci (E) = ci (B) for i = 1, 2. From (4.3), we get c1 (E) = 0 and we compute that c2 (E) is\nrepresented by the homology class of the curve C. So we clearly cannot use the above\nform of the Serre construction if c1 (B) 6= 0. But we can easily cancel the anomaly by\n\ntensoring E by an appropriate line bundle in many cases. And since most bundles cannot\n\nbe produced by the Serre construction, there is no reason to doubt that the anomaly can\nbe cancelled for most or even all B by using more general bundles. The above comments\nnotwithstanding, we will stick with the Serre construction for now so that we can be more\nprecise.\nTo cancel the c1 anomaly, we have to replace E by E \u2297 L, where L is a line bundle\n\nwith 2c1 (L) = c1 (B). Note that not every element of integral cohomology is divisible by 2,\nso L need not exist. But in a rough sense, \"about half\" of the B's have this property. For\nexample, for a hypersurface B \u2282 P4 of odd degree 2n + 1, we have c1 (B) = O(4 \u2212 2n) so\nwe can take L = O(2 \u2212 n).\nNow\n\nc2 (E \u2297 L) = c2 (E) + c1 (E) * c1 (L) + c1 (L)2 = c2 (E) + c1 (L)2 ,\nso we just have to take any elliptic curve C representing the cohomology class c2 (B) \u2212\n\nc1 (L)2 , and anomaly cancellation is satisfied. It is very easy to find such curves, at least\nas long as c2 (B) \u2212 c1 (B)2 /4 is non-negative, since elliptic curves abound on Fano and\nCalabi-Yau threefolds B.\n\n4.2. Conifold Transitions\nIt is now a simple matter to use the results of the previous section to pull the bundle\nE \u2297 L through the conifold transition, at least as far as the complex structure is concerned.\nThe metric will be left for future work.\n\nWe first note how the Chern classes of B change under a conifold transition [87]:\nc1 (B) = c1 (B \u2032 ),\n\nc2 (B) = c2 (B \u2032 ) \u2212 [E],\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere we are using the notation introduced in sec. 2.1, i.e. E \u2282 B is the P1 that contracts\n\nto the conifold B0 , which then smooths to B \u2032 . If we let C \u2282 B and C \u2032 \u2282 B \u2032 be the\n45\n\n\felliptic curves used in the Serre construction to construct bundles E, E \u2032 , it follows from\n\n(4.4) and the calculation of the Chern classes in the previous section that we must require\nC = C \u2032 \u2212 E, and then we will be done.\n\nThis situation is easy to arrange. We let C0 \u2282 B0 be an elliptic curve containing the\n\nconifold with the required cohomology class. Then C0 deforms to the desired elliptic curve\n\nC \u2032 \u2282 B \u2032 . On the other end of the transition, the preimage of C0 under the contraction\nmap B \u2192 B0 is a reducible curve of the form C + E, where C projects isomorphically to\n\nC0 , hence is elliptic. So C = C \u2032 \u2212 E in the required sense, and we get bundles E \u2297 L and\n\nE \u2032 \u2297 L which satisfy the required properties. Note that we have used (4.4) to identify the\n\nappropriate bundle L on B with another bundle on B \u2032 which has also been denoted by L.\n\n5. M-theory and non-K\u00e4hler manifolds\nSo far we have discussed the issues of vector bundles for the kind of heterotic compactifications related to geometric transitions. In this section we want to address a more\ngeneric question: Under what condition does a F-theory (or an equivalent M-theory) compactification) with fluxes allow K\u00e4hler or non-K\u00e4hler manifolds with vector bundles? In\nother words, how does the back\u2013reaction of vector bundles affect the underlying heterotic\ngeometries?\nA brief discussion of this issue appeared in [88], where it was discussed that localized\nand non\u2013localized fluxes from M-theory play an important role in determing the precise\nback\u2013reaction effects on the underlying geometry. The conclusion was that the heterotic\nmanifold is always non\u2013K\u00e4hler when there are only non\u2013localized M\u2013theory fluxes. On\nthe other hand, in the presence of only localized fluxes, the manifold may or may not be\nK\u00e4hler. The generic formula for the non\u2013K\u00e4hlerity is given by the relation:\ndJ = \u03b1\u2032 \u2217 [\u03a93 (\u03c9+ ) \u2212 \u03a93 (A)] + e\u22122\u03c6 d\u03c6 \u2227 J\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere A is the one-form gauge bundle and \u03c6 is the heterotic dilaton. Apparently, even\nin the absence of a background three\u2013form, the manifold can become non\u2013K\u00e4hler due to\nvector bundles and non\u2013trivial dilaton. Thus, K\u00e4hlerity is restored only when\n\u03c9+ = A,\n\n\u03c6 = constant\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhich is precisely the condition studied in [89]! Here we have derived the condition by\ndemanding a K\u00e4hler compactification from the generic equation for dJ.\n46\n\n\fLet us now imagine that we do not turn on any non\u2013localized gauge fluxes and at\nthe same time do not allow the standard embedding. Then naively we would expect to\nget a non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifold with the non\u2013K\u00e4hlerity coming precisely from the difference\n\u03a93 (\u03c9+ ) \u2212 \u03a93 (A) (and the dilaton). In fact, the three\u2013form fluxes will typically look like\n[75], [46]\n\n\u0010\n1 \u0303\n1  \u0303  \u0303  \u0303\u0011\n\u03b1\u2032\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\nTr \u03c90 \u2227 f \u2227 f + f \u2227 R\u03c90 + f \u2227 df \u2212 f \u2227 f \u2227 f + O(\u03b1\u20322 )\nH = f+\n2\n2\n6\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere f = \u03b1\u2032 [\u03a93 (\u03c90 ) \u2212 \u03a93 (A)] and \u03c90 is the gravitational spin-connection at zeroth order\nin \u03b1\u2032 (see [46] for more details). We have also defined f \u0303 as a one\u2013form created from f\nusing the vielbeins, and\n2\nR\u03c90 = d\u03c90 + \u03c90 \u2227 \u03c90 .\n3\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe above three\u2013form back-reacts on the geometry to make the space non\u2013K\u00e4hler. Thus,\nvector bundles without the standard embedding seem to be allowed only on non\u2013K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds. This would seem to contradict the result of [90] where it was found that a\nfractional gauge Chern\u2013Simons term can appear in an ordinary K\u00e4hler compactification.\nHowever, this apparent puzzle can be resolved by taking the background gaugino condensate into account41 . This can be explained as follows:\nThe existence of torsion in the heterotic theory is a direct consequence of G\u2013fluxes in\nM\u2013theory [4], [91], [23]. As mentioned above, there are two kinds of fluxes: localized and\nnon\u2013localized ones [45], [46]. M\u2013theory anomaly cancellation (i.e. non\u2013zero Euler number)\nrequires fluxes for consistency. Considering only non\u2013localised fluxes gives rise to heterotic\ntorsion. But this picture is in general not complete. This is because localized fluxes\nat the orbifold singularities are inevitable consequences of the existence of normalizable\nharmonic forms near the singularities [92]. The situation becomes more involved because\nof the presence of non\u2013localized fluxes that back\u2013react on the harmonic forms by reverse\u2013\nbackreacting on the geometry. In a generic situation, the harmonic forms may not be\neasy to evaluate. However for our case this could be done [92]. A more standard analysis\nof how both kinds of fluxes conspire to give the right Bianchi identity in the heterotic\ntheory has been presented in [45]. We will not go into details here, and conclude that flux\n41\n\nThe gaugino condensate contributes to the (3,0) and the (0,3) part of the three\u2013form, and\n\ncan break susy. But we will consider a condensate that preserves susy.\n\n47\n\n\fcompactifications in M\u2013theory generically lead to vector bundles in the heterotic side, and\nin special cases, also to torsion42 .\nTo conclude, the manifold can still become non\u2013K\u00e4hler in the absence of flux via the\nrelation (5.1). In [90] the \u03a93 (\u03c9) term was cancelled by one of the Chern-Simons terms of\nthe gauge fields. Therefore, the non\u2013K\u00e4hlerity in this model arose from vector bundles of\none of the E8 gauge groups. To obtain a Calabi\u2013Yau space we need dJ = 0. This can only\nbe true with an additional contribution to the superpotential of [75], [76]. This additional\ncontribution has been worked out in [77] following the work of [93] (see also [94] for some\nrecent works). The equation for non\u2013K\u00e4hlerity is now given by\ndJ = \u03b1\u2032 \u2217 [\u03a93 (\u03c9+ ) \u2212 \u03a93 (A)] \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 \u2217 h\u03c7\u0304A \u0393\u03c7A i + e\u22122\u03c6 d\u03c6 \u2227 J\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere \u03c7A are the gaugino fields of heterotic theory.\nThe above equation can in principle have solutions with dJ = 0 if the dilaton is chosen\nto be constant. In fact, both the gaugino condensate term and the anomaly term are of\nthe same order in \u03b1\u2032 if we ignore the O(\u03b1\u20322 ) terms from (5.3). If we cancel the \u03a93 term\n\nwith one of the E8 terms \u03a93 (A1 ) in (5.5), then dJ vanishes (for a constant dilaton) iff we\nchoose a negative sign for the condensate. This could in principle resolve the puzzle raised\nfor [90]. Furthermore, the above identification restricts the possible values for the gaugino\ncondensate.\nTo summarize, a dynamical way to study a flux background is to take our proposed\nsuperpotential and solve for dJ using the various contributions (tree level, perturbative\n42\n\nRecall that the complex three\u2013form that appears in heterotic theory in the presence of torsion\n\nhas to be imaginary self\u2013dual (ISD) to preserve supersymmetry in four dimensions. This implies\nthe background equation (5.1). This equation is more general than the constraint derived in\n[61],[44], [59] and it reduces to the known form when the manifold is complex [75]. This equation\nmakes the non\u2013K\u00e4hler nature of the manifold manifest. Observe, that if we scale the metric then\nthe three\u2013form H scales linearly, too. On the other hand, from the Bianchi identity we observe\nthat the three\u2013form does not scale (at least to the lowest order in \u03b1\u2032 ). This implies that the radial\nmodulus should get stabilized [45], [75]. This argument, although correct, is rather naive at this\npoint. The fact that the Bianchi identity does not scale is only true for the K\u00e4hler case. In the\nnon\u2013K\u00e4hler case the three form appears on both sides of the identity (as we saw in the derivation\nof the correct background three\u2013form). Therefore the correct way to study the potential for the\nradial modulus would be to evaluate the three\u2013form flux order by order in \u03b1\u2032 and use the kinetic\nterm to calculate the potential. This was done in [75], [46].\n\n48\n\n\fand non-perturbative). If dJ = 0 with integrable complex structure we obtain K\u00e4hler CY\ncompactifications. All other cases, i.e. when dJ 6= 0 with integrable or non\u2013integrable\ncomplex structure, will correspond to non\u2013K\u00e4hler compactifications. In this case the radius is stabilized at tree level. In the K\u00e4hler case, the radius is fixed non\u2013perturbatively\n[95],[96],[90]. In both cases the \u03c3\u2013model conformal invariance is restored at that particular\nradius.\nThus, along with the mathematical analysis of vector bundles in sec. 4, we have a\nnearly complete picture of the gravity dual in heterotic theory. Recently, a detailed study\nof vector bundles on compact non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifolds that are some T 2 bundle over a K3\nbase (the examples studied in [4], [23], [91], [97], [45], [75], [46]) was presented in [68] (see\nalso [67] for earlier works on the subject from a mathematical point of view and [66], [46]\nfor a physical point of view).\n\n6. Global type IIA background\nWe have now sufficiently elaborated on the heterotic and the type IIB setup. In type\nIIB the local metric is the metric of D5 branes wrapped on a two\u2013 cycle of a resolved\nconifold a-la [21]. The global picture is obtained from an F\u2013theory background that we\ndiscussed in sec. 2.1, and has F\u2013theory seven\u2013branes distributed in some particular way\ndetermined by an underlying Weierstrass equation. The whole configuration preserves\nN = 1 supersymmetry.\nWe will now discuss the global type IIA background, which will turn out to have\nintersecting D6\u2013branes and O6\u2013planes on a geometry that looks locally like the non\u2013\nK\u00e4hler deformed conifold constructed in [18]. However, the F\u2013theory setup will change\nthe allowed fluxes, which have to be invariant under a certain orientifold action. This will\naffect the metric only in a minor way, but we will show that we find fluxes which cannot be\ncompletely gauged away. This is in contrast to the M\u2013theory lift advocated in [18], where\nour non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifold lifted to a purely geometrical background in 11 dimensions. The\nbackground constructed here will lift to an 11\u2013dimensional background with G\u2013fluxes. We\ncomment on the implications for G2 structure versus G2 holonomy in the next section.\n49\n\n\f6.1. Type IIA background revisited\nThe full global type IIA is now determined as a mirror of the global IIB background.\nThe local metric was already discussed in [18] and [19]. The mirror D6 branes in the local\npicture now wrap the three cycle of a non\u2013K\u00e4hler deformed conifold. Globally there are\nadditional D\u2013branes and O\u2013planes. They are the mirror of the type IIB D7/O7 system. To\nspecify the precise coordinates of the branes in type IIA picture, let us consider carefully\nthe orientations of the branes in type IIB case. In the local type IIB background, the\nresolved conifold has two two\u2013tori oriented along (x, \u03b81 ) and (y, \u03b82 ). The U (1) fibration\nis given by the coordinate z, and the radial direction is r. In this local framework, let\nus assume that the D5 branes wrap the torus (y, \u03b82 ) and are stretched along spacetime\ncoordinates x0,1,2,3 . A mirror transformation results in D6 branes oriented along (z, x, \u03b82 )\nand stretched along the usual spacetime directions x0,1,2,3. The local non-K\u00e4hler metric of\na deformed conifold is given by (2.1). The three\u2013cycle is a U (1) fibration over a compact\ntwo\u2013dimensional space specified by (\u03b1, \u03b2) such that\nds22 = g\u03032 d\u03b81 (d\u03b81 \u2212 2\u03b1) + g3 dy(dy \u2212 2\u03b2)\n\n(6.1)\n\nforms another two dimensional subspace inside the non\u2013K\u00e4hler deformed conifold43 . If we\ndenote the type IIB BNS as (bx\u03b81 , by\u03b82 ) \u2261 (b1 , b2 ), then the differential forms (\u03b1, \u03b2) and\nthe function g\u03032 are\n\n\u03b1 = sin(2 tan\u22121 b1 ) dx,\n\n\u03b2 = b2 dy,\n\ng\u03032 = g2 (1 + b21 )\n\n(6.2)\n\nwith g2 , g3 defined in [18], [19] and in (2.1). The metric of the three\u2013cycle can now be\nwritten as ds23 = Gmn\n\uf8eb\nGzz Gzx\n\uf8ec\nG=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed Gxz Gxx\nG\u03b82 z G\u03b82 x\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n43\n\ndy m dy n with y m = (z, x, \u03b82 ), and\n\uf8f6\nGz\u03b82\n\uf8f7\nGx\u03b82 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nG\u03b82 \u03b82\n\ng1\ng1 \u22061 cot \u03b8b1\n\n\u2212g1 b2 \u22062 cot \u03b8b2\n\ng1 \u22061 cot \u03b8b1\n\ng2 + g1 \u220621 cot2 \u03b8b1\n\n\u2212g1 b2 \u22061 \u22062 cot \u03b8b1 cot \u03b8b2\n\n\u2212g1 b2 \u22062 cot \u03b8b2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\u2212g1 b2 \u22061 \u22062 cot \u03b8b1 cot \u03b8b2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\ng\u03033 + g1 b22 \u220622 cot2 \u03b8b2\n(6.3)\n\nIn the language of the non\u2013K\u00e4hler metric, the U (1) fibration is over the full four\u2013dimensional\nsubspace and is not restricted to the 2d base (\u03b1, \u03b2).\n\n50\n\n\fwith g\u03033 defined as g\u03033 = g3 (1 + b22 ). (6.3) is the precise metric of the three\u2013cycle on which\nwe have wrapped D6 branes in the local geometry.\nTo study the full global picture, we have to contemplate a few possible scenarios in\ntype IIB theory, all resulting from different torus fibrations of the F\u2013theory fourfold:\n(1) The F\u2013theory torus is fibered non\u2013trivially over the two\u2013dimensional torus parametrized\nby (x, y). This would mean that the seven branes wrap directions (z, \u03b81 , \u03b82 ) and are\nstretched along the non\u2013compact directions (r, x0,1,2,3).\n(2) The F\u2013theory torus is fibered non\u2013trivially over a different two dimensional torus\nparametrised by (x, \u03b81 ). Here the seven branes would wrap directions (y, \u03b82 , z), and are\nstretched along the same non\u2013compact directions as above.\n(3) The F\u2013theory torus is fibered non\u2013trivially over a compact two dimensional surface\nparametrised by (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ). The seven branes in this scenario will wrap directions (x, y, z)\nand are stretched along the other non\u2013compact directions as above.\nThree T\u2013dualities along (x, y, z) will act non\u2013trivially in all these cases. Let us consider\ncase (1) first. Two T\u2013dualities along (x, y) will take us to type I SO(32) theory. This is\nprecisely the background studied in [19]. An S\u2013duality to this background will give us the\nrequired heterotic manifold, whose global geometry we studied in section 3.\nA further T\u2013duality along z direction to the type I geometry will take us to type IIA.\nIn fact, the type IIA background is an orientifold background. But since an orientifold\noperation is not a symmetry of type IIA theory, we should also accompany the orientifold\naction \u03a9 with a space reversal along the z direction, Iz : z \u2192 \u2212z. Thus the duality chain\nfor this case is\n\nType I on\n\nSz1\n\u03a9\n\nTz\n\u2212\u2192\n\nType IIA on\n\nSz1\n\u03a9 * Iz * (\u22121)FL\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere Tz denote T\u2013duality along the z direction and (\u22121)FL changes the sign of the left\u2013\nmoving Ramond sector. The two fixed points of Iz are the two O8 planes, their charge\nbeing cancelled by D8\u2013branes [72], [98].\n\nThe global picture has therefore wrapped D6\u2013branes on three\u2013cycle of a non\u2013K\u00e4hler\nmanifold, along with a D8 \u2212 O8 system at the two fixed points of z (or \u03c8 in global coordinates). The D8 \u2212 O8 system intersects the D6 branes along a compact two dimensional\ntorus (x, \u03b82 ) and the 3+1 dimensional non\u2013compact spacetime x0,1,2,3.\n51\n\n\fIn case (2), a mirror transformation gives rise to another type IIA background modded\nout by an orientifold action. The precise duality chain is\nType IIB on\n\nT5\n\u03a9 * Ix\u03b81 * (\u22121)FL\n\nTxyz\n\u2212\u2192\n\nType IIA on\n\nT5\n\u03a9 * Iyz\u03b81 * (\u22121)FL\n\n(6.5)\n\n2\n2\nwhere the T 5 torus is given by T 5 = T(x\u03b8\n\u00d7 T(y\u03b8\n\u00d7 Sz1 , with Sz1 forming the U (1)\n1)\n2)\n\nfibration discussed above. The fixed points of this action are the O6 planes whose charges\n\nare cancelled by D6\u2013branes. This D6 \u2212 O6 system intersects with the other wrapped D6\nbranes along the same compact two\u2013torus (x, \u03b82 ) and the 3+1 dimensional non\u2013compact\n\nspacetime.\nFinally, in case (3), we expect the type IIA orientifold operation to be \u03a9 * Ixyz\u03b81 \u03b82 *\n\n(\u22121)FL . The fixed points of this action are the O4 planes which need D4 branes to cancel\n\nthe total charge locally. These four\u2013branes are oriented along the non\u2013compact directions\n(r, x0,1,2,3), and therefore overlap with the wrapped D6 branes only along the spacetime\ndirections.\nLet us now study the metric. Case (1) with intersecting D6 \u2212 D8 \u2212 O8 system cannot\n\nbe the global completion of our type IIA background. Recall, that the original type IIB\n(local) metric is not invariant under the orientifold operation of case (1) [19]. There are\ncross terms in the metric that are not invariant under orientation reversal. The invariant\npart of the metric can eventually give us a valid heterotic background, but it lacks the\ncross terms characteristic for the deformed conifold. This will not lead to the non\u2013K\u00e4hler\ndeformed conifold we require for the geometric transtition in IIA\n\n44\n\n.\n\nOne can also easily rule out case (3), where the F\u2013theory fibration is along the compact\ndirection (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) in the local picture. A coordinate reversal transformation I\u03b81 \u03b82 : \u03b8i \u2192 \u2212\u03b8i\n\ndoes not appear to be a symmetry of the local metric (2.2). So the metric cannot provide\nthe type IIA global picture.\nThis leaves us with case (2) where the F\u2013theory torus is fibered over the (x, \u03b81 ) torus.\nNot only is the IIB metric (2.2) invariant under (x, \u03b81 )\n\n\u2192 (\u2212x, \u2212\u03b81 ), but also the two\n\ntori with non\u2013trivial complex structure (boosted by f1,2 ). This means that after a mirror\n44\n\nNote, that even an attempt to obtain a IIA background in this scenario is futile, because the\n\nglobal metric in type I/heterotic lost its isometry along z (or \u03c8). Therefore we cannot perform\nthe last T\u2013duality that would lead to a IIA background. But, as explained above, even if it was\npossible to T\u2013dualize along non\u2013isometry directions (see e.g. [99]) the resulting background would\nnot be the one we require in IIA.\n\n52\n\n\ftransformation we will have a global intersecting D6 \u2212 O6 \u2212 D6 system in type IIA with\n\na local configuration of wrapped D6 branes on the three cycle of a non\u2013K\u00e4hler deformed\n\nconifold. Since no part of the metric is projected out under orientifold operation, this will\nserve as the full global picture in type IIA.\nHaving obtained a complete global picture in terms of D7/O7 in type IIB or D6/O6\nin type IIA, we now turn to the question what the global picture means in terms of the\nunderlying N = 1 gauge theory. The answer, as anticipated in section 2.2., is simple\nbecause in type IIB the existence of D7/O7 implies global symmetries in the gauge theory\n[26]. In our case the global symmetry will be SU (2)16 instead of the expected SO(8)4\nbecause of Wilson lines. This means that we are actually studying N = 1 SU (N ) gauge\n\ntheory with fundamental flavors transforming under the global symmetry SU (2)16 .\n6.2. More subtleties\n\nThe above conclusion, although correct, is unfortunately premature. The underlying\norientifolding/orbifolding operation makes the situation rather tricky.\nFirst, observe that the type IIB orientifold operation has a non\u2013trivial effect on the\nBNS and BRR fields. The original choice of BNS fields (bx\u03b81 , by\u03b82 ) are projected out. This\nwould mean that the fibration structures in the type IIA local metric would also have to\nchange. In fact the three cases studied earlier give rise to the following choices of type IIB\nBNS fields:\n\u2022 Case (1): \u03a9 and Ixy allow bx\u03b81 , bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 , by\u03b82 . We used these choices to determine\n\nthe heterotic manifold after geometric transition in earlier sections.\n\u2022 Case (2): \u03a9 and Ix\u03b81 only allow bx\u03b82 and by\u03b81\n\n45\n\n. This implies that the metric in IIA\n\nwill have a different fibration structure compared to the one that gave rise to the heterotic\nbckground.\n\u2022 Case (3): \u03a9 and I\u03b81 \u03b82 also allow bx\u03b81 , bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 , by\u03b82 . However this choice of orien-\n\ntifolding is not useful enough to get a global IIA metric, as we discussed above.\n\nThe type IIA local metric will change accordingly to accomodate the actions of O6\nplanes. The metric still remains a non\u2013K\u00e4hler deformation of a Calabi-Yau deformed\n45\n\nThe orientifold action also allows for other components of BN S fields like bxz , bxr , bz\u03b81 , br\u03b81\n\nbut we can set them to zero and study the theory with only two components consistently.\n\n53\n\n\fconifold, but is now given as\nds2IIA = g1\n\nh\ni2\ndz + \u22061 cot \u03b8b1 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) + \u22062 cot \u03b8b2 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) + ... +\n\n+ g2 [d\u03b812 + (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 )2 ] + g3 [d\u03b822 + (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )2 ] + g4 sin \u03c8 [(dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) d\u03b82\n+ (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) d\u03b81 ] + g4 cos \u03c8 [d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 )(dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )].\n\n(6.6)\n\nOne can also check that the metric remains invariant under the orientifold operation \u03a9 *\n\nIyz\u03b81 when rotating by \u03c8 as in [18]. This implies that we should set \u03c8 = h\u03c8i in (2.9).\nAllowing for non\u2013constant \u03c8 (i.e. extending \u03c8 to z) would result in a non\u2013trivial constraint\n\non the warp factor g4 in (6.6):\ng4 = g4 (r, \u03b81 , \u03b82 )|r=r0 =\n\nX\n\nan \u03b812n+1 g\u03034 (r0 , \u03b82 )\n\n(6.7)\n\nn\n\nwhere an are some non\u2013zero numbers and g\u03034 is another function of (r = r0 , \u03b82 ).\nOne might also contemplate a more generic relation between \u03c8 and z as \u03c8 = f (z).\nFor the metric (6.6) to remain invariant under orientifold action, the function f (z) has to\nsatisfy\nf (z) + f (\u2212z) = \u03c0.\n\n(6.8)\n\nAlthough such a choice would put no constraints on the warp factors gi in (6.6), the functional dependence would not be consistent with the simple choice of the small coordinate\nshifts in type IIB (2.9). Therefore, (6.7) seems to be the only reasonable constraint we can\nimpose on the warp factor g4 .\nThe next subtleties are related to the choice of B fields in type IIB. The new choice\nof BNS fields (bx\u03b82 and by\u03b81 ) will induce the following BNS fields in the mirror type IIA\nbackground:\nBIIA =\n\np\n\np\np\nh\u03b1i1 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 d\u03b81 \u2212 h\u03b1i2 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03b82 + A h\u03b1i1 d\u03b81 \u2227 dz +\np\n+ B h\u03b1i2 (dy sin \u03c8 \u2212 cos \u03c8 d\u03b82 \u2212 by\u03b81 sin \u03c8 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 dz\n(6.9)\n\nwhere h\u03b1ii and (A, B) were defined in [18], [19]. We wrote the BNS field using h\u03b1ii to\n\nemphasize the fact that some of the terms are pure gauge (see [19] for more details on\nthis). Does that means that we can gauge them away? It turns out that because of the\npresence of D6 branes, we cannot gauge away all components of BNS . The ungauged part\n\nof the BNS field will appear as gauge fluxes on the D6 branes.\n54\n\n\fSince this issue is a little subtle, we will tread carefully in the following. We can\nperform a \u03c8 rotation on (y, \u03b82 ) as in (3.23) by identifying h\u03c8i = \u03c8 (see also [18]). This\n\nwill change the BNS field into\n\nBIIA = (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 d\u03b8\u03031 \u2212 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 + (d\u03b8b1 + d\u03b8b2 ) \u2227 dz\n\n= bx\u03b82 d\u03b8\u03031 \u2227 d\u03b82 + by\u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 + dx \u2227 d\u03b8\u03031 \u2212 dy \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 + (d\u03b8b1 + d\u03b8b2 ) \u2227 dz\n\n(6.10)\n\nwhere we have isolated the B\u2013field part that depends on the type IIB B\u2013fields. The\nquantities appearing here are defined as:\nh\ni\n1\nb 1)\nln(k cos \u03b81 + \u2206\n\u03b8\u03031 = \u2212 \u221a\nk b1\n\u0014p\n\u0015\n1\nk\nsin\n\u03b8\n1\n\u03b8b1 = \u221a\nb1 arctan\nb1\nk b1\n\u2206\nr\nq\nb1 \u2212 a 1\nb\n1 \u2212 k 2 sin2 \u03b81\nk =\n,\n\u22061 =\na1\n1\n1\nh\u03b1i1 =\n\u2261\n2\n2\n0 2\n0 2\n1 + (\u22061 ) cot \u03b81 + (\u22062 ) cot h\u03b82 i\na1 + b1 cot2 \u03b81\nwith an equivalent description for \u03b8\u03032 and \u03b8b2 .\n\n(6.11)\n\nUsing this one can show that the b\u2013\n\nindependent parts of (6.10) are pure gauge.\n\nHow many components of the b\u2013independent part of (6.10) can be gauged away? In the\n\nabsence of D6 branes, all the components can be gauged to zero. Ignoring the spacetime\norientations of the six\u2013branes and planes, we see that the b\u2013independent part of (6.10)\nthat would appear as gauge flux F on the wrapped D6 branes would be\nFz\u03b82 =\n\nlim\n\u01eb\u21920\n\ni\nh\np\n\u01eb\u22121 B h\u03b1i2 d\u03b82 \u2227 dz\n\n(6.12)\n\non a non\u2013trivial two\u2013cycle inside the three\u2013cycle of the non\u2013K\u00e4hler deformed conifold.\nThis gauge flux is very large and will provide a non\u2013commutativity parameter to the\ngauge theory on wrapped D6 branes46 . All other b\u2013independent components of (6.10) are\ngauge equivalent to zero47 .\nLet us now consider the b\u2013dependent part of (6.10). The type IIA B\u2013field depends on\nthe type IIB components (bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 ) which could have non\u2013zero field strength. Because of\n46\n\nObserve that the 3 + 1 dimensional N = 1 SU (N ) gauge theory is still commutative.\n\n47\n\nObserve that there are no possibilities of any pinning effect [100] or any dipole behavior [101]\n\nhere. For topologically trivial cycles, we would have encountered more involved scenarios.\n\n55\n\n\fthe underlying mirror transformation the components of (6.10) should be independent of\n(x, y, z). Furthermore, the b\u2013dependent terms in (6.10) have wedge structures of the form\nd\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 and d\u03b8\u03031 \u2227 d\u03b82 . If the components (bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 ) were functions of (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) only and\n\nnot of r, the radial coordinate, we would find dBIIB 6= 0, dBIIA = 0, i.e. the type IIA B\u2013\n\nfield (6.10) will have no field strengths, whereas the type IIB B\u2013field will have a non\u2013zero\n\nfield strengths48 . Such B\u2013field components are projected out at the orientifold point, but\naway from the orientifold point49 we can have bx\u03b82 = bx\u03b82 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) and by\u03b81 = by\u03b81 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ).\nTherefore, if we we want to gauge away as many components of HIIA as possible, our first\nans\u00e4tze for the type IIB B\u2013field components would be\nbx\u03b82 =\n\nX\n\nbmn cotm \u03b81 cot2n \u03b82 ,\n\nby\u03b81 =\n\nm,n\n\nX\n\nckl cotk \u03b81 cot2l \u03b82\n\n(6.13)\n\nk,l\n\nwhere bmn and ckl are integers independent of (x, y, z, \u03b8i, r). The precise numbers will\nbe determined by the background equations of motion. Plugging this ansatz (6.13) into\n(6.10), one of the b\u2013dependent component takes the following form:\nby\u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 =\n\nX\nk,l\n\nckl d\u03981 \u2227 d\u03982\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhich is again a pure gauge. Similarly, the other b\u2013dependent component can also be\nexpressed as a pure gauge. The variables \u0398i are defined in terms of \u03b8i as\n\u03981 =\n\nZ\n\nk\n\ncot \u03b81 ,\n\n\u03982 =\n\nZ\n\ncot2l \u03b82\n.\na2 + b2 cot2 \u03b82\n\n(6.15)\n\nExpressing (6.10) in terms of \u0398i , none of these components are parallel to the six\u2013branes.\nThus, they would not contribute to fluxes in type IIA theory and could be completely\ngauged to zero. Then the only non\u2013trivial effect from type IIA B\u2013field will be the appearence of the gauge flux (6.12) on an internal two\u2013cycle of the non\u2013K\u00e4hler deformed\nconifold50 .\n48\n\nType IIB NS threeform field HIIB \u2261 H components will be Hx\u03b81 \u03b82 = \u2202[\u03b81 b|x|\u03b82 ] and Hy\u03b81 \u03b82 =\n\n\u2202[\u03b82 b|y|\u03b81 ] .\n49\n\nIn fact away from the orientifold point, all components of the B\u2013field can be allowed.\n\n50\n\nThe reader might wonder about switching on a type IIB component bz\u03b82 which in type IIA\n\nwould be mirror to a component parallel to the six\u2013branes. However, such a component would\nbe projected out in IIB by the orientifold operation. Away from the orientifold point, such a\ncomponent will be allowed.\n\n56\n\n\fAbove analysis assumed the seven branes of type IIB being far away so that we are no\nlonger at the orientifold point. This is consistent with the picture of integrating out all the\nflavors to study N = 1 pure SU (N ) Yang\u2013Mills theory. The choice of type IIB BNS \u2013field\n\ndetermines the allowed components of the type IIB BRR \u2013field from the linearized equation\nof motion\nHRR = \u22176 HNS\n\n(6.16)\n\nwhere the Hodge\u2013\u22176 is w.r.t. the six dimensional internal space. (6.16) allows for the\nfollowing components of HRR \u2261 h: hyzr and hxzr . This is equivalent to choosing \u2202BRR \u2261\n\u2202B as \u2202r Bxz and \u2202r Byz . This means that one particular consistent choice of B\u2013fields in\n\ntype IIB away from the orientifold point is\nBNS : [bx\u03b82 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), by\u03b81 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 )]\n\nBRR : [Bxz (r), Byz (r)] .\n\n(6.17)\n\nSo now the natural question would be: which B\u2013field components in type IIB and type\nIIA are allowed at the orientifold point? Observe that the choice of B\u2013fields away from the\norientifold point (6.17) is not very symmetric. It would seem more natural to switch on\nsimilar components for both BNS and BRR (see the solutions in [1] and [21]). A possible\nchoice at the orientifold point, that also satisfies (6.16), would be to define the BNS \u2013field\nas BNS : [bx\u03b82 (r), by\u03b81 (r)] and the field strengths as:\nHNS : [Hx\u03b82 r = \u2202r bx\u03b82 ,\n\nHy\u03b81 r = \u2202r by\u03b81 ]\n\nHRR : [hx\u03b82 z = \u22176 Hy\u03b81 r ,\n\nhy\u03b81 z = \u22176 Hx\u03b82 r ] .\n\n(6.18)\n\nAre these choices of B\u2013fields away from the orientifold point (6.17) and at the orientifold\npoint (6.18) consistent? We propose the following scenario:\n\u2022 Locally, the radial dependence in (6.18) will not be visible because of (2.9). Thus, HNS\n\nand HRR are very small in our region of interest.\n\n\u2022 Once we go away from the orientifold point, then non\u2013perturbative effects will change\nthe background [43]. In particular, bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 will now also depend on \u03b8i .\n\nThus, given a background (6.18) we can deform it into (6.17) with non\u2013perturbative\ncorrections. The deformation happens when we want to move the seven branes away from\nthe wrapped D5 branes. This is the case when one of the orientifold points coincides\nwith the resolution two\u2013cycle of the F\u2013theory base discussed in sec. 2.1. So we can still\nremain at the orientifold point if the resolution two\u2013cycle does not coincide with any of\nthe orientifold points. This is again similar to the situation encountered in the F\u2013theory\n57\n\n\fconstruction with Klebanov\u2013Strassler base [5]. The seven branes and orientifold points do\nnot coincide with the conifold point (where we have wrapped D5 branes).\nBefore moving ahead let us clarify one more point. The BRR fields for the two cases\nthat we discussed above i.e (6.17) and (6.18), would seem to imply that we have changed\nthe orientation of the wrapped D5 branes. Recall that our initial wrapped D5 branes\nwere on a two-torus along (y, \u03b82 ) directions. However the choice (6.18) would seem not to\nallow such wrapped D5 branes. This is an illusion, because the choice (6.18) will change\ncompletely as soon as we go away from the orientifold point. Once we are away from the\norientifold point, the sources for the wrapped D5 can be easily shown to be present there.\nHowever, there is another much deeper reason why we can allow all kind of configurations\nof wrapped D5 branes in our scenario. This has to do with the fact that we are defining\nthe background only locally. In the local version, the type IIB metric can be rewritten as\nds2 = dr 2 + (dz + A dx + B dy)2 + (d\u03b812 + dx2 ) + (d\u03b822 + dy 2 ) + ....\n\n(6.19)\n\nwhere we can extract the values of A and B from (2.10) as:\nA = \u220601 cot h\u03b81 i + O(\u03b81 ),\n\nB = \u220602 cot h\u03b82 i + O(\u03b82 )\n\n(6.20)\n\nwhich tells us that they are basically constants. This would imply that the fibration\nstructure can be written as dz\u0303 \u2248 dz + A dx + B dy. Therefore from the above local\nmetric, D5 branes wrapping directions (y, \u03b82 ), can be easily traded with (r, y) directions\n\nand vice-versa. So the precise way by which we can go from the global type IIB model\nto the local metric (2.2) is to put non-trivial complex structure on the (x, \u03b81 ) and (y, r)\ntori, trade the local r coordinate with local \u03b82 and then redefine the dz\u0303 fibration structure\naccordingly. This way configuration at the orientifold point, and configuration away from\nthe orientifold point will be identical.\nThus at the orientifold point, we can stick with our configuration (6.18). Now assuming\nsuch a scenario simplifies the ensuing analysis, because we do not have to worry about\nnon\u2013perturbative corrections from the splitting of orientifold\u2013seven planes in type IIB, the\nresulting O6 planes in type IIA will not split either. We then employ the following generic\nchoice of type IIB RR field:\nBRR = c1 dx \u2227 dz + c2 dx \u2227 dy + c3 dx \u2227 d\u03b82 +\n+ c4 dy \u2227 d\u03b81 + c5 dz \u2227 d\u03b81 + c6 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82\n58\n\n(6.21)\n\n\fwhere we have allowed for two new components c2 and c6 that are naively allowed under\norientifold action. The coefficients ci are in general functions or (r, \u03b81 , \u03b82 ). The BNS\ncomponents are still (bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 ). With this choice of BRR , we obtain the following one\u2013\nform field A in the mirror type IIA:\nA=\n\n2AB\n(c1 \u2212 \u03b1Bc2 ) (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) + (c1 \u2212 2\u03b1Bc2 ) (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2212 c2 dz\n1 + A2\n\n(6.22)\n\nwhere we used the freedom of choosing the orientation of BNS similar to [18]. The fibration\nstructure of the metric (6.6) remains as before. The one\u2013form (6.22) will be sourced by\nthe wrapped D6 branes.\nApart from the one form, there will also be three\u2013forms in the mirror IIA. They arise\nprecisely because of our choices of BNS components in IIB. They are given by:\nC =\n\nCxy1 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03b81\n+ Cxy2 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 d\u03b82\n+ Cxz1 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81 + Cyz2 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b82\n\n(6.23)\n\n+ Cxz2 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b82 + Cyz1 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81\nwhere the coefficients are defined in the following way:\n2\u03b1f1 c1 A2 B 2\n+ 2\u03b1B(c4 \u2212 f1 c2 )\n1 + A2\ni\n2\u03b1AB 2 h\n=\n\u2212\nc\n+\nf\n(Bc\n\u2212\nc\n)\n3\n2\n1\n2\n1 + A2\n2f1 c1 A2 B\n= c4 \u2212 f1 c2 +\n, Cyz2 = \u2212c3 + f2 (Bc1 \u2212 c2 )\n1 + A2\ni\n2AB h\n=\n\u2212\nc\n+\nf\n(Bc\n\u2212\nc\n)\nCyz1 = A f1 c1\n3\n2\n1\n2 ,\n1 + A2\n\nCxy1 = \u2212c5 + f1 c1 +\nCxy2\nCxz1\nCxz2\n\n(6.24)\n\nWe can make the following interesting observations:\n\u2022 All individual coefficients can be separated into fi \u2013dependent and fi \u2013independent parts.\n\n\u2022 The terms containing f1 are always accompanied by d\u03b81 . The same statement is true for\n\nthe f2 \u2013dependent terms. These terms (like f1 d\u03b81 and f2 d\u03b82 ) are exact functions, and can\ntherefore be written in terms of d\u03b8\u0303i of (6.11).\n\u2022 The fi \u2013dependent terms are also accompanied by either c1 or c2 or both.\n\nThis raises the suspicion that maybe all RR\u2013fluxes are pure gauge artifacts, too. We\n\nwill show in the following that this is not the case, but that we obtain G\u2013fluxes which will\n59\n\n\fcontribute to M\u2013theory fluxes. These, in turn, allow for a smooth flop transition, avoiding\nthe singular point in the conifold transition.\n\nIt suffices first to consider a simple case where some of the coefficients ci in (6.21)\nare allowed to vanish. What is the minimum number of ci that have to be non\u2013zero?\nObviously, the one\u2013form (6.22) depends only on c1 and c2 . Since this has to be non\u2013zero\nbecause of the wrapped D6\u2013branes, we will make the simplifying assumption that all other\nci vanish. This doesn't quite work because if c2 is non-zero, then from (6.21) we see that\nthis switches on a component dx \u2227 dy. But from (6.18) we know that such a component\ndoesn't exist, at least for the simplfied case that we wanted to analyse. Thus we take:\nCase 1 :\n\nc1 = c1 (\u03b82 ),\n\nc2 = c3 = c4 = c5 = c6 = 0\n\n(6.25)\n\nwhere the \u03b82 dependence of c1 is motivated from the choice of background HRR in (6.18)51 .\nThis implies for the type IIB HRR fields:\nhxz\u03b82 =\n\n\u2202c1\n,\n\u2202\u03b82\n\nhyz\u03b81 = 0\n\n(6.26)\n\nwhich is consistent with the expected components of HRR in type IIB from (6.18) if bx\u03b82\nalso vanishes, or is independent of the radial coordinate. Thus the choice (6.25) implies\nthat we choose in type IIB the local metric (2.2) and the B-fields:\nBNS = by\u03b81 (r) dy \u2227 d\u03b81 ,\n\nBRR = c1 (\u03b82 ) dx \u2227 dz\n\n(6.27)\n\nand in mirror type IIA the following background\nds2IIA\n\nh\ni2\nb\nb\n= g1 dz + \u22061 cot \u03b81 dx + \u22062 cot \u03b82 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) + ... +\n\n+ g2 [d\u03b812 + dx2 ] + g3 [d\u03b822 + (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )2 ] + g4 sin \u03c8 [dx d\u03b82 +\n\n+ (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) d\u03b81 ] + g4 cos \u03c8 [d\u03b81 d\u03b82 \u2212 dx (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )]\n\nA =\nBIIA\n51\n\n(6.28)\n\n2ABc1\ndx + c1 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )\n1 + A2\n= by\u03b81 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032\n\nThere is a little more to it. The choice of HRR as in (6.25) also means that we have chosen\n\nthe orientation of the wrapped D5 branes in our type IIB model. As we saw earlier, it doesn't\nreally matter how the D5 branes are wrapped as long as we are taking consistent background NS\nand RR fields satisfying equations of motion and correct orientifold projections. Clearly (6.21)\nsatisfies the second constraint, and we can make sure that (6.25) will satisfy both the constraints.\nFurthermore as we will see below, many more cases can be entertained in our global picture.\n\n60\n\n\fWe now see that the choice (6.25) simplifies the coefficients (6.23) quite a bit. Infact,\nP6\ncombining (6.25), (6.11) in (6.23) we can re-express (6.23) as C =\n1=1 Ci with\n\u0010\n2\u03b1c1 A2 B 2 \u0011\nc1 +\ndx \u2227 dy \u2227 d\u03b8\u03031\n1 + A2\n2\u03b1AB 2 c1 b\n=\nd\u03b82 \u2227 dx \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )\n1 + A2\n2ABc1 b\nd\u03b81 \u2227 dx \u2227 dz\n=\n1 + A2\n= c1 d\u03b8b2 \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 dz\n\nC1 \u2261 C[xy1] =\nC2 \u2261 C[xy2]\nC3 \u2261 C[xz1]\nC4 \u2261 C[yz2]\n\nC5 \u2261 C[xz2] =\n\n2ABc1 b\nd\u03b82 \u2227 dx \u2227 dz,\n1 + A2\n\n(6.29)\n\nC6 \u2261 C[yz1] = c1 dy \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b8b1\n\nwhere we have separated the terms with d\u03b8\u0303i and d\u03b8bi as defined in (6.11).\n\nThe existence of the C field component Cxz2 implies that we can define a combination\nV =\n\n\u221a\n\ndet G + i|C5 |\n\n(6.30)\n\nwhere G is the metric of the three\u2013cycle along (x, z, \u03b82 ) directions (6.3) and |C5 | from\n(6.29) is the coefficient along d\u03b6 \u2261 dx \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b82 but now evaluated for c1 = c1 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) by\ndeforming away from the orientifold point. Therefore, the effective volume of the three\n\u221a\ncycle along (x, z, \u03b82 ) is V and not just det G from (6.3). This implies that in the limit\n\u221a\n\ndet G \u2192 0,\n\n|V| \u2261\n\np\n\ndet G + |C5 |2 \u2192 |C5 |\n\n(6.31)\n\nwhich is non-zero. Thus, when we lift the type IIA background to M\u2013theory as in [18]\nto a seven dimensional manifold with G2 structure, a flop operation is a completely non-\n\nsingular operation. This is perfectly consistent with the predictions of [34] and [35] and\njustifies the analysis of [18].\nRecall that the type IIA BNS fields were almost all pure gauge52 . Let us now show\nthat this is not the case for BRR . We can simply evaluate the field strenths of the fluxes.\nThe G\u2013fluxes are found to be\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nA2\n\u03b1A\n\u2202\n\u2202\nGxy\u03b81 \u03b82 =\n(c1 + 2\u03b1c1 B 2 ) d\u03b8\u03031 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2212 2B 2 c1\nd\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8b2 dx \u2227 dy\n1 + A2 \u2202\u03b82\n\u2202\u03b81 1 + A2\n(6.32)\n52\n\nOf course this does not mean that they can all be gauged away. As discussed above, gauge\n\nflux along the brane world volume cannot be gauged away.\n\n61\n\n\fwhich is still non\u2013zero even in the local limit where A, B and \u03b1 are just constants. The\nmost important G\u2013flux component is\nGxz\u03b81 \u03b82 =\n\n\"\n\n\u2202\n2A2 \u2202\n(Bc1 ) d\u03b8\u03031 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2212 2Bc1\n2\n1 + A \u2202\u03b82\n\u2202\u03b81\n\n\u0012\n\nA\n1 + A2\n\n\u0013\n\n#\n\nd\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8b2 dx \u2227 dz (6.33)\n\nwhich shows that |C5 | cannot be gauged away. Finally, there is one more component that\nis similar to the type IIB RR three form (6.26). It is given by\nGyz\u03b81 \u03b82 =\n\n\u2202c2\nd\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 \u2227 dy \u2227 dz\n\u2202\u03b81\n\n(6.34)\n\nwith all other components vanishing. The existence of these G\u2013fluxes is precisely the reason\nwhy our M\u2013theory manifold does not have a G2 holonomy, but only a G2 structure. In\n\nthe next section we discuss the implications for SU (3) and G2 torsion classes in IIA and\nM\u2013theory, respectively.\n\nFor completeness let us also mention that our background may also have non\u2013zero\n\nfive\u2013form\nCxyz\u03b81 \u03b82 = c6 + f1 c3 \u2212 f2 (1 + f1 )c4 + B(c5 \u2212 f1 c1 )f2 .\n\n(6.35)\n\nFor the simple background (6.25) this is a pure gauge, and will therefore not affect type\nIIA dynamics.\nOur next simple case would be when we allow all the components in (6.18). This\nwould imply that both the BNS components (bx\u03b82 , by\u03b81 ) are non-zero. The ci in (6.21) will\nbe\nCase 2 :\n\nc1 = c1 (\u03b82 ),\n\nc4 = c4 (z),\n\nc2 = c3 = c5 = c6 = 0\n\n(6.36)\n\nand the type IIA metric will become (6.6) instead of (6.28). The type IIB threeform will\nhave both the components, with hyz\u03b81 now given by hyz\u03b81 =\n\n\u2202c4\n\u2202z\n\nand hxz\u03b82 as before\n\n(6.26). It is also easy to see that the C components Cxy2 , Cyz2 , Cyz1 and Cxz2 will also\n\nremain as before (6.29). The only changes will be to the following components: Cxy1 and\nCxz1 , and they will be given by\n\u03b4C[xy1] = 2\u03b1Bc4 dx \u2227 dy \u2227 d\u03b81 ,\n\n\u03b4C[xz1] = c4 dx \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81\n\n(6.37)\n\nThese changes will be reflected on the G-fluxes also. As one would have expected, the\nchanges in the G-fluxes will be precisely from the additional c4 terms. In fact we will have\n62\n\n\fone new component of G-flux in addition to the ones that we already evaluated in (6.32),\n(6.33), (6.34)53 . This is given by\nG[xyz\u03b81 ] = \u22122\u03b1B\n\n\u2202c4\ndx \u2227 dy \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81\n\u2202z\n\n(6.38)\n\nThe five form, which is now given by\nh\ni\nC[xyz\u03b81 \u03b82 ] = \u2212 c4 d\u03b8\u03041 \u2227 d\u03b8\u03032 \u2212 c1 d\u03b8\u03031 \u2227 d\u03b8b2 \u2227 dx \u2227 dy \u2227 dz\n\n(6.39)\n\nstill remains a pure gauge. We have also defined \u03b8\u03041 = \u03b81 + \u03b8\u03031 . From above we see that\nthe case of flop in the M-theory lift of our background still remains non-singular. The\nflux configurations are now much more involved, but the basic physics have not changed.\nOne little concern here would be the c4 (z) part. This is explicitly a function of z and\ntherefore might create problems for our T-duality transformations. One could overcome\nthis problem by making a T-duality transformation on the HRR directly following the rules\ngiven in [102]. All we now require is to make hyz\u03b81 independent of z direction. For our\ncase, this doesn't seem to be of any concern.\nThe above discussion then leads us to describe yet another case, that could in principle\noccur if we make the field strengths in type IIB independent of the duality directions. This\nwould be when in (6.21) we allow\nCase 3 :\n\nc1 = c1 (\u03b82 ), c3 = c3 (z), c4 = c4 (z), c5 = c5 (y), c2 = c6 = 0 (6.40)\n\nFor this case, the HRR would be more complicated than the ones that we had earlier. The\ncomponents of HRR would become\nhxz\u03b82 =\n\n\u2202c1\n\u2202c3\n\u2212\n,\n\u2202\u03b82\n\u2202z\n\nhyz\u03b81 =\n\n\u2202c5 \u2202c4\n\u2212\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n\n(6.41)\n\nBoth these components are to be arranged so that they satisfy the type IIB equation of\nmotion. Since the BNS components have remained unchanged we can easily satisfy the\nimaginary self-duality condition of the type IIB three form fluxes. Rest of the analysis\nfollows a straightforward route, using the mirror rules. The type IIA metric and the\none-forms remain same as before, but the three forms and their corresponding G-fluxes\nchange.\n53\n\nThese components of G-fluxes will not change although the corresponding C-fields have\n\nchanged.\n\n63\n\n\fBefore we go into the analysis of torsion classes, consider two other hypothetical\nscenarios. First one is a charge zero configuration. Due to the F-theory construction behind\nour type II models, the global charges all cancel when we consider compact fourfold in sec.\n2.1. Imagine we continue the charge zero configuration even after we allow non-compact\nfourfolds. Of course such a charge zero state will allow only a finite number of fractional\nD3 branes. Next, let us also allow local charge cancellation. This way in (6.21) we can\nallow:\nCase 4 :\n\nc3 = c3 (z), c4 = c4 (z), c1 \u2192 0, c5 = c2 = c6 = 0\n\n(6.42)\n\nFor this case the HRR can be easily extracted from (6.41) now. The three-forms are\nvery interesting now. They will be completely independent of f1 or f2 . The non-zero\ncomponents will be given by\nCxy2 = \u2212\n\n2\u03b1c3 AB 2\n,\n1 + A2\n\nCxz2 = \u2212\n\nCxz1 = c4 ,\n\n2c3 AB\n,\n1 + A2\n\nCyz2 = \u2212c3\n\n(6.43)\n\nwith all other components vanishing. The G-fluxes for such a configuration are simpler\nthan the earlier examples. This is because of the coordinate structure of c3 and c4 . One\ncan easily show that the G-fluxes will be independent of c4 , and will be given entirely by\nc3 as\nGxyz\u03b82\nGxz\u03b81 \u03b82\n\n2\u03b1AB 2 \u2202c3\n2 \u2202\n,\nG\n=\n2c\nB\n=\nxy\u03b8\n\u03b8\n3\n1\n2\n1 + A2 \u2202z\n\u2202\u03b81\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\n\u2202\n= 2Bc3\n\u2202\u03b81 1 + A2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1A\n1 + A2\n\n\u0013\n\n(6.44)\n\nwhere the relevant component of G-flux Gxz\u03b81 \u03b82 vanishes in the local region implying that\nthe corresponding potential Cxz\u03b82 can be gauged away. The operation of flop in M-theory\nmay however still remain non-singular because globally the G-flux component Gxz\u03b81 \u03b82 is\nnot expected to vanish.\nThe second one, although not very important for our main line of thought followed\nin this paper, is another generalisation that could be done to (6.21). What we mean is to\nadd two more terms to (6.21) that are invariant under our global orientifold operation in\ntype IIB theory. The only allowed ones are\nCase 5 :\n\nc1 = c1 (\u03b82 ), ci = 0,\n\n\u03b4BRR = c7 dr \u2227 dx + c8 dr \u2227 d\u03b81\n\n(6.45)\n\nwhere the total type IIB background RR field will be BRR + \u03b4BRR and i = 2, ..., 6. We\nare also assuming that c7 , c8 would in general be functions of (\u03b8i , z).\n64\n\n\fThis change in type IIB BRR field will effect the mirror picture. It turns out that the\ntype IIA one form will not change at all from the value derived earlier in (6.22). However,\nthe mirror type IIA three form will now change from the one derived earlier in (6.23) to\n\u03b4C = Cryz dr \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 dz + Crxz dr \u2227 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 dz\n+ Crxy dr \u2227 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 )\n\n(6.46)\n\nwhere as before, the total three form field will be C + \u03b4C, and the coefficients in (6.46) are\n\nnow given by\n\nCryz = c7 ,\n\nCrxz =\n\n2c7 AB\n,\n1 + A2\n\nCrxy =\n\n2\u03b1c7 AB 2\n1 + A2\n\n(6.47)\n\nLooking carefully at the additional components of the three form we observe that the three\nform component Crxz is exactly equal to the part of Cxz\u03b82 if we replace c7 \u2194 \u2212c3 . In fact\n\nall the above components are exactly the same under the substitution. What does this\nmean? We already gave an answer to this question when we discussed the local equivalence\nbetween the r and \u03b82 directions. Under this equivalence we clearly see why c7 and c8 terms\nof (6.45) do not contribute to the one form (6.22). Furthermore it is also clear why c8 term\ndo not contribute to the three form above.\nThe equivalences between (r, \u03b82 ) and (c7 , \u2212c3 ) are also consistent with the wrapped\n\nD5 brane scenario. Recall that because of the orientifold action the D5 branes can be\nthought to be along the (r, y) directions in the internal space. This would imply that we\nshould look for the combination\nV2 =\n\n\u221a\n\ng1 g2 gr +\n\n2i c7 AB\n1 + A2\n\n(6.48)\n\nas our complexified volume, where g1 , g2 , gr are the warp factors in the type IIA metric\n(6.6). This combination goes over to the original combination (6.30) once we go away from\nthe orientifold limit and consider c1 in (6.21) as c1 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ). In the same scenario we can\ndefine another effective volume along (x, z, \u03b82 ) direction as\n\nV3 =\n\ns\n\n2i c3 AB\ng1 g42 sin2 h\u03c8i\n\u2212\ng1 g2 g3 \u2212\n4\n1 + A2\n\n(6.49)\n\nwhich has somewhat similar behavior as (6.48) and would match precisely with (6.48) if\ng3 = gr and h\u03c8i small. The connection to (6.30) will now be the following. Away from the\n65\n\n\forientifold point bx\u03b82 and by\u03b81 will be functions of (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) also. This would mean that we\nhave the other two components bx\u03b81 and by\u03b82 . The D5 branes in type IIB can be assumed\nto warp directions (y, \u03b82 ) and then the volume element will be (6.30). Our picture at the\norientifold point with volume element (6.48) should be considered at this stage as a toy\nmodel that is helpful in clarifying all the expected details that one would expect from a\nmodel away from the orientifold point. Thus (6.49) will serve as an intermediate scenario\nbetween (6.48) and (6.30).\nNow from the earlier discussion we should expect that the c8 term in (6.45) only\ncontributes to the five form, exactly the way c6 term contributes to the five form. This is\neasily verified by computing the mirror five form\n\u03b4C5 = \u2212(c8 + c7 f1 ) dr \u2227 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b82 d\u03b82 ) \u2227 (dy \u2212 by\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81\n\n(6.50)\n\nwhere one can show that the other expected components of the five form Crxyz\u03b82 and\nCrxz\u03b81 \u03b82 are proportional to \u01ebf1 and since f1 goes like f1 \u223c\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u01eb\n\nthese components go to\n\nzero when \u01eb \u2192 0. Finally, if we also take\n\nhxzr \u2261\n\nc8 = 0,\n\n\u2202c7\n\u2202z\n\n(6.51)\n\nwhere hxzr is the type IIB three form, then one can show that the additional contribution\nto the five form (6.50) is also a pure gauge. With this the analysis of type IIA will be\ncomplete.\n\n7. Torsion classes\nAfter all the detailed discussion about the global type IIA manifolds, we will now\nattempt to classify the IIA non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifolds that we constructed. As already pointed\nout in [18] we do not find a half\u2013flat manifold after performing three T\u2013dualities with\nfluxes. This might appear to contradict current literature on this subject, but we will\nshow the contrary. First, it has been shown that lifting a 10dim manifold on a twisted\ncircle (i.e. with gauge field as in our case) can still give a supersymmetric M\u2013theory\nbackground, even if the 10dim manifold was not half\u2013flat. But we can only obtain torsion\nclasses for our local background, which does not show supersymmetry. We therefore neither\nexpect a half\u2013flat manifold nor the one discussed in [29] on the grounds of supersymmetry.\nFurthermore, we actually do not expect a 11dim manifold with G2 holonomy, since our\nM\u2013theory background has flux turned on.\n66\n\n\f7.1. SU (3) and G2 structure manifolds\nIt is by now widely known that string theory backgrounds with fluxes do not require a\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifold (with SU (3) holonomy). The 4dim N = 1 supersymmetry condition\nof a covariantly constant spinor is relaxed to the existence of a globally defined spinor\n\nthat is constant with respect to a torsional connection. This reduces the structure group\nof the 6dim manifold from SO(6) to SU (3) and the intrinsic torsion decomposes under\nrepresentations of SU (3). In particular, the torsion lies in 5 classes [66], [103]: \u03c41 \u2208\n\nW1 \u2295 W2 \u2295 W3 \u2295 W4 \u2295 W5 .\n\nThe failure of the torsional connection to be the Levi\u2013Civita connection is measured\n\nin the failure of fundamental 2\u2013form and holomorphic 3\u2013form to be closed. Defining a set\nof real vielbeins {ei } one can define an almost complex structure as\nE1 = e1 + i e2\nE2 = e3 + i e4\n\n(7.1)\n\nE3 = e5 + i e6\nwhich gives rise to a (1,1)\u2013form w.r.t. this almost complex structure\nJ = e1 \u2227 e2 + e3 \u2227 e4 + e5 \u2227 e6 .\n\n(7.2)\n\nSimilarly, one defines a holomorphic 3\u2013form w.r.t. this almost complex structure\n\u03a9 = \u03a9+ + i \u03a9\u2212 = (e1 + i e2 ) \u2227 (e3 + i e4 ) \u2227 (e5 + i e5 ) ,\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere \u03a9\u00b1 are the real adn imaginary part of \u03a9, repectively. J and \u03a9 fulfill the compatibility\nrelations\n\nJ \u2227 \u03a9+ = J \u2227 \u03a9\u2212 = 0\n2\n\u03a9+ \u2227 \u03a9\u2212 = J \u2227 J \u2227 J .\n3\nThe torsion classes are then determined by the following forms:\n\n(7.4)\n\nW1 \u2194 dJ (3,0)\n\n(2,2)\n\nW2 \u2194 (d\u03a9)0\n\n(2,1)\n\nW3 \u2194 (dJ)0\n\nW4 \u2194 J \u2227 dJ\nW5 \u2194 d\u03a9(3,1) ,\n67\n\n(7.5)\n\n\fwhere the subscript 0 refers to the primitive part, i.e. in the cases in question \u03b2 \u2208\n\nVp,q\n0\n\nif\n\n\u03b2 \u2227 J = 0. It is immediately obvious that complex manifolds have to have vanishing W1\n\nand W2 and K\u00e4hler manifolds are determined by \u03c41 \u2208 W5 . Decomposing \u03a9 = \u03a9+ + i \u03a9\u2212\nwe can write more precisely\n\nd\u03a9\u00b1 \u2227 J = \u03a9\u00b1 \u2227 dJ = W1\u00b1 J \u2227 J \u2227 J\n(2,2)\n\nd\u03a9\u00b1\n\n= W1\u00b1 J \u2227 J + W2\u00b1 \u2227 J\n\n(7.6)\n\ndJ (2,1) = (J \u2227 W4 )(2,1) + W3 ,\nso W1 is given by two real numbers, W1 = W1+ + W1\u2212 , W2 is a (1,1) form and W3 is a\n(2,1) form. With the definition of the contraction\n\u21c0:\n\n^\n\nk\n\nT\u2217 \u2297\n\n^\n\nn\n\nT \u2217 \u2212\u2192\n\n^\n\nn\u2212k\n\nT\u2217\n\n(7.7)\n\nand the convention e1 \u2227 e2 \u21c0 e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e3 \u2227 e4 = e3 \u2227 e4 we define\n1\nJ \u21c0 dJ\n2\n1\nW5 = \u03a9+ \u21c0 d\u03a9+ .\n2\nW4 =\n\n(7.8)\n\nA half\u2013flat manifold is specified by \u03c41 \u2208 W1+ \u2295 W2+ \u2295 W3 , which follows from J \u2227 dJ = 0\n\nand d\u03a9\u2212 = 0, but d\u03a9+ 6= 0 (this lead to the terminology \"half\u2013flat\"). Note that the\n\nassignment of \u03a9\u2212 and \u03a9+ may be switched.\n\nSimilar statements hold true for M\u2013theory on 7\u2013manifolds, which would require G2\nholonomy to preserve 4dim N = 1 supersymmetry in the absence of flux. The funda-\n\nmental object now is a nowhere vanishing 3\u2013form \u03a6 and its failure to be closed and/or\nco\u2013closed determines the torsion. The relevant structure group is G2 and the intrinsic\ntorsion decomposes under this group. This results in 4 torsion classes for the 7\u2013manifold:\n\u03c42 \u2208 X1 \u2295 X2 \u2295 X3 \u2295 X4 . There are given by\nd\u03a6 = X1 (\u2217\u03a6) + X4 \u2227 \u03a6 + X3\n4\nd(\u2217\u03a6) =\nX4 \u2227 (\u2217\u03a6) + X2 \u2227 \u03a6 .\n3\n\n(7.9)\n\nIn [52],[66] it was demonstrated how a manifold with SU (3) structure can be lifted on a\ntrivial circle or interval to a G2 holonomy. One defines the G2 invariant 3\u2013form as\n\u03a6 = \u03a9+ + J \u2227 e7\n68\n\n(7.10)\n\n\fwhere e7 parametrizes the 7th direction, such that the resulting 7\u2013manifold is M \u00d7 I with\n\nI \u2282 IR. This produces Hitchin's flow equations if the 6\u2013manifold is half\u2013flat.\n\nIn contrast, we are more interested in the case discussed in [29]. Starting with an\n\nSU (3)\u2013structure manifold X they constructed a G2 \u2013structure manifold Y as a lift over a\ntwisted circle with dilaton and gauge field:\nds2Y = e\u22122\u03b1\u03c6 ds2X + e2\u03b2\u03c6 (dz + A)2 .\n\n(7.11)\n\nWe will adopt the string frame in which \u03b1 = 1/3 and \u03b2 = 2/3. In this case one should\ndefine the 3\u2013form on the 7\u2013manifold rather as\n2\n\n\u03a6 = e\u2212\u03c6 \u03a9+ + e\u2212 3 \u03c6 J \u2227 e7 .\n\n(7.12)\n\nThis gives straightforward relations between the torsion classes Wi and Xj that generally\n\ninvolve the field strength F = dA and the dilaton \u03c6. It was shown in [29] that requiring G2\n\nholonomy (i.e. d\u03a6 = d(\u2217\u03a6) = 0 or equivalently Xi = 0) leads to the following constraints\n\non the SU (3) torsion classes:\n\nW1\u00b1 = W2\u2212 = W3 = W4 = 0\n(1,1)\n\nW2+ = \u2212e\u03c6 F0\n\n,\n\nW5 =\n\n1\nd\u03c6 .\n3\n\n(7.13)\n\nNote, that only in the string frame W4 = 0, otherwise it is also proportional to d\u03c6. This\n(1,1)\n\nshows that the 6\u2013manifold does not need to be K\u00e4hler (if F0\n\nto be half-flat either (it still could be if d\u03c6 = 0).\n\n6= 0), but it does not need\n\nThis short discussion was intended to clarify that half\u2013flat manifolds are not the only\nmanifolds that can be lifted to a G2 holonomy. One has to be specific about which type of\nlift is chosen. It is immediately clear that our scenario requires the 7-th direction to be a\ntwisted circle, since the IIA background has a gauge field A. But since we have also other\nbackground fluxes turned on, we obtain a torsional M\u2013theory background after the lift.\nTherefore, the manifold we propose in IIA is neither half\u2013flat nor has it torsion restricted\nto W2+ \u2295 W5 .\n\nWe now turn to the question what type of manifold we have constructed in IIA. Unfor-\n\ntunately, we had to take a local limit of the metric to be able to perform T\u2013dualities from\nIIB to IIA. Therefore, the global information about our manifold is lost. It does strictly\nspeaking not make sense to discuss the metric (2.1) when one is looking for topological\n69\n\n\fproperties, such as torsion classes. In the local background supersymmetry is not visible,\nbut for the global supersymmetric background we do not know the metric. At this point\nthere is no way out of this dilemma and we have to postpone the topological analysis of\nthe supersymmetric background to future work.\nHowever, we find it instructive to discuss the torsion of the local metric found in [18]\nas an example. This is not the background obtained from the F\u2013theory construction in\nIIB, but shows a different fibration structure. This does not have major consequences for\nthe torsion classes, we therefore restrict ourselves to this case.\n7.2. Torsion classes before geometric transition\nIn this section we will only discuss the IIA case. It is shown that with a quite generic\nansatz for the almost complex structure we can find a symplectic structure on the local\nmetric, but no half\u2013flat structure54 . One possible choice for vielbeins in IIA is\n\u0001\n\u221a\ne1 = dr ,\ne2 = g1 dz + A(dx \u2212 bx\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) + B(dy \u2212 by\u03b82 d\u03b82 )\ns\ns\n1 4g2 g3 \u2212 g42\n1 4g2 g3 \u2212 g42\nd\u03b82 ,\ne4 =\n(dy \u2212 by\u03b82 d\u03b82 )\ne3 =\n2\ng2\n2\ng2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\ng4\ne5 = g2 sin \u03c80 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) + cos \u03c80 d\u03b81 +\nd\u03b82\n2g2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\ng4\ne6 = g2 cos \u03c80 (dx \u2212 bx\u03b81 d\u03b81 ) \u2212 sin \u03c80 d\u03b81 \u2212\n(dy \u2212 by\u03b82 d\u03b82 )\n2g2\n\n(7.14)\n\nFollowing the discussion in [81] we write down the most generic candidate for a fundamental\n2\u2013form\nJ =\n\nX\ni<j\n\naij ei \u2227 ej ,\n\n(7.15)\n\nwhere the coefficients aij could in principle depend on all coordinates. This has to be\ncompatible with an almost complex structure JBA = \u03b4 AC JCB , i.e. we require J 2 = \u22121. If\n\nwe furthermore make the assumption that a13 = a14 = 0,55 the almost complex structure\n54\n\nThis statement holds true if one considers the IIA background abtained from IIB with ori-\n\nentifold action, but the precise torsion classes differ.\n55\n\nThis seems sensible because it holds for all known conifold geometries [81], and basically only\n\nimplies that the complex vielbein containing dr does not contain e3 and e4 . It can still contain\ndy and d\u03b82 , since those also appear in e5 and e6 .\n\n70\n\n\ftakes a particularly simple form [81]. The complex vielbeins can be written as\nE1 = e1 + i e2\nE2 = e3 + i (X e4 \u2212 P e6 )\n\n(7.16)\n\nE3 = e5 + i (X e6 + P e4 ) .\nwith the restriction P 2 +X 2 = 1. In the following we will make the simplifying assumption\nthat P (and therefore X) is a function of r only.\nWith this setup, J and \u03a9 are defined and one can calculate dJ and d\u03a9. One immediately notices that W4 = 0, because\n\u0011\n4g2 g3 \u2212 g42 \u0010\n\u2032\n\u2032\nP (r)P (r) + X(r)X (r) dr \u2227 dx \u2227 dy \u2227 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 ,\nJ \u2227 dJ = \u2212\n2\n\n(7.17)\n\nwhich is identically zero because of P (r)2 + X(r)2 = 1. It is nevertheless not a half-flat\nmanifold, because there is no choice of P (r) that makes either d\u03a9+ = 0 or d\u03a9\u2212 = 0.\nWe can, however, choose P (r) to give a symplectic structure. Consider W1\u00b1 given by\n\nd\u03a9\u00b1 \u2227 J = W1\u00b1 J \u2227 J \u2227 J:\nW1+\nW1\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\ng1 (4g2 g3 \u2212 g42 ) \u2032\np\nP (r) dr \u2227 dx \u2227 dy \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82\n2 1 \u2212 P (r)2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\np\n1 \u221a\n2\n2\n2\n= \u2212\ng1 P (r)(g4 \u2212 4g2 g3 ) + g4 4g2 g3 \u2212 g4 1 \u2212 P (r) \u00d7\n4\n\u0001\nb\u2032x\u03b81 (r) + b\u2032y\u03b82 (r) dr \u2227 dx \u2227 dy \u2227 dz \u2227 d\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03b82 .\n\n=\n\n(7.18)\n\nNote that in our local background the function gi are simply constants and we have assumed\nthe IIB BNS \u2013field components to have r\u2013dependence only. Obviously, W1+ vanises if P (r)\n\nis constant (the prime denotes derivative w.r.t. r).

In the limit that we took when performing\nthe T\u2013dualities to go from IIB to IIA, this is exactly the same as the IIB dilaton and\nconstant (at least in the local limit). We see that the geometric transition maps the\ntorsion classes W2\u00b1 and W5 into themselves. By using the Hitchin flow equations, this\nmeans that the corresponding G2 torsion classes are mapped into themselves. But we\nknow that the flop just replaces the usual x11 lifting direction with the fiber direction\ninside the Hopf fibration S 3 /ZZN over S 2 . These two circles are used to lift SU (3) torsion\nclasses to G2 torsion classes and this tells us that the G2 torsion classes are not changed\nduring the flop.\n73\n\n\f8. Conclusions and Future Directions\nGeometric transitions are a powerful method to connect string theory and field theory.\nThey have been used extensively to check and predict effective results in field theory from\nstring theory. In this project, which is a continuation of our previous work [18], [19],\nwe addressed several questions related to the geometric transition framework and reached\nconclusions which point out some subtle modification of the original framework of [3].\nFirst, we showed that, in terms of SUGRA solutions, an acceptable way to to construct a SUSY solution is to consider a global picture with additional branes and planes.\nAway from the wrapped D5 branes on resolution two cycles of our manifold, there are\nadditional seven branes and orientifold seven planes during the geometric transition. Such\na configuration has two immediate advantages: on the one hand their presence allows a\nconsistent lift to a SUSY F\u2013theory picture and on the other hand they do not directly\ninfluence the effective theory as they can be viewed as massive flavors that are integrated\nout. If we consider them as part of the effective theory (by raising the energy scale of the\ntheory), the field theory would be an SU (N ) gauge theory with fundamental flavors. This\nis a somewhat different configuration from the original framework of [3] (see also [16]) and\nwould change the geometric transition identifications. These further complications will\ntranslate into a currently unknown metric for D5\u2013D7 system.\nSecond, the local picture that we proposed in this paper captures the dynamics of\nN = 1 SU (N ) gauge theory without any flavors. The local picture also explains the fact\n\nthat in the mirror IIA picture our non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifold is not expected to resemble any\n\nof the examples proposed in the literature [104]. Globally, in type IIA there are extra D6\nbranes which correspond to massive flavors which are integrated out to obtain the local\nmodel. In both type IIA and type IIB, the global framework involves subtle orientifold\nactions that have roots in our proposed F\u2013theory setup56 .\nAnother important topic in our work was to deepen the evidence of a heterotic transition, even though the usual topological string methods are still missing for the (0,2)\n56\n\nIt would be interesting to see whether the global M-theory lift of our type IIA background\n\nis connected to any of the solutions presented in [105]. A way to search for such a solution is\nto consider the solutions of [105] and look for four dimensional slices of the seven dimensional\nmanifolds that would resemble Atiyah-Hitchin spaces. In addition to that, if the local form of the\nmetric resembles the local M-theory metric presented in [18], then this solution can be a candidate\nfor our global M-theory picture. More details on this will be presented in the sequel.\n\n74\n\n\ftheories. We managed to show that there is a surprising analogy between two hitherto\ndifferent solutions, namely, the Maldacena\u2013Nunez solution [2] in type IIB and the heterotic\ndual to the type IIB solution proposed in [19]. In fact, an interesting generalization of the\nMaldacena\u2013Nunez solution with several warp factors was mapped to a global heterotic\nsolution which then takes us away from the orientifold point. The existence of such a mapping indicates the possibility that our global heterotic model may indeed be dual to the\ntheory on wrapped heterotic NS5 branes. However, to make this more concrete we need\nto provide more evidence, and the simple identification between two metrics is probably\nnot too rigorous.\nOur discussion is just the tip of an iceberg. Clearly, much work remains in order to\nclarify above points. It would be interesting to find information about the global picture by\nintegrating in the massive flavors. This would imply changes in HNS and HRR due to the\npresence of D7 branes which consequently change the dual gauge theory57 . This method\nshould remove the non\u2013SUSY problems of [21] and offer us consistent global geometry.\nOur work should also be viewed as connecting gauge theories with the dynamics\nof non\u2013K\u00e4hler manifolds. This would open up an extensive direction of research. An\nimmediate next step would be to further connect our results with the generalized complex\ngeometries of Hitchin [52] and Gualtieri [53], which unify metric and NS field. It should also\nbe possible to consider the heterotic solution in the context of Chiral de Rham complex\nand chiral differential operators. This would provide a method for performing genuine\nheterotic topological computations with important application in describing moduli spaces\nof N = 1 theories.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Allan Adams, Katrin Becker, Robert Brandenberger, Atish Dabholkar, Ji-Xiang Fu, Rhiannon Gwyn, Shamit Kachru, Jan Louis, Dave Morrison, Eric\nSharpe, Nemani Suryanarayana, Andy Strominger, Wati Taylor, Li-Sheng Tseng, Cumrun\nVafa and Shing-Tung Yau for useful discussions and correspondences.
