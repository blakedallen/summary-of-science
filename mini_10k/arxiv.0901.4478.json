Lie in the 19th century. They appear widely, sometimes as reflect of certain linear phenomena,\nand sometimes as genuine non-linear superposition (see Example 6.1). The local characterization of ordinary differential equations admitting superposition\nlaws was partially done by S. Lie and G. Sheffers in [11]. In the last quarter\nof 20th century, superposition laws attracted again the attention of pure and\napplied mathematicians. Shnider and Winternitz, in [16], classify the germs of\nlow dimension differential equations admitting superposition laws. This work\ncan be seen as a classification of germs of homogeneous spaces. There is also\na number of applied papers on the subject, including [18, 17, 15, 9, 7, 4, 5]. A\ngood treatment of superposition laws can be seen in the textbook [8], and there\nis a monography completely devoted to the subject [3].\nHowever, the theoretical approach to superposition laws relies is Lie's characterization. This is a local result, and avoid the global problem of construction\nof group. This problem was tackled first by Vessiot in [19], who analyzed the\n\u2217 This research has been partially supported by grant MCyT-FEDER MTM2006-00478of\nSpanish goverment, and the Sergio Arboleda University Research Agency CIVILIZAR.\n\n1\n\n\fsame subject that Lie, but under a slighly different point of view, more related\nwith differential Galois theory. Instead of taking the Lie algebra of the group\nfrom the joint invariants, Vessiot extract the group structure directly from the\nsuperposition law. This idea is systematically used along Section 6. Those are\nthe key points that allow is to relate superposition of solutions with differential\nGalois theory.\nIn the original infinitesimal Lie's approach, it is necessary to integrate a Lie\nalgebra of autonomous vector fields, in order to obtain a number of arbitrary\nconstants that correspond to joint invariants \u2013 by joint invariants we mean\nfirst integral of the differential equation lifted to the cartesian power. But, in\nthe general case, there are not appropiated joint invariants (see Example 4.1).\nInstead of this, we recover at least a foliation on the cartesian power of the\nphase space, and each leave of the foliation correspond to a determination of\nthose theoretical arbitrary constants. This defect was noticed by Cari\u00f1ena,\nGrabowsky and Marmo [6]. They substitute the notion of superposition law\nfor the milder notion of local superposition; then the classical statement of Lie\nholds. Here we give the conditions for the existence of a superposition law in\nthe global classical sense, that is, a globally defined map that allow us to recover\nthe general solution.\nAn ordinary differential equation admitting a fundamental system of solutions is, by definition, a system of non-autonomous differential equations,\ndxi\n= Fi (t, x1 , . . . , xn ) i = 1, . . . , n\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nfor which there exists a set of formulae,\n\u03c6i (x(1) , . . . , x(r) ; \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) i = 1, . . . , n\n\n(2)\n\nexpressing the general solution as function of r particular solutions of (1) and\nsome arbitrary constants \u03bbi . This means that for r particular solutions\n(i)\n(i)\n(x1 (t), . . . , xn (t)) of the equations, satisfying certain non-degeneracy condition,\n(1)\n(r)\nxi (t) = \u03c6i (x1 (t), . . . , x(1)\n(3)\nn (t), . . . , xn (t); \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn )\nis the general solution of the equation (1). In [12] Lie also stated that the arbitrary constants \u03bbi parametrize the solution space, in the sense that for different\nconstants, we obtain different solutions: there are not functional relations between the arbitrary constants \u03bbi . The set of formulae \u03c6i is usually referred to\nas a superposition law for solutions of (1).\nThe class of ordinary differential equations admitting fundamental systems of\nsolutions, or superposition laws, was introduced by S. Lie in 1885 [11], as certain\nclass of auxiliary equations appearing in his integration methods for ordinary\ndifferential equations. Further development is due to Guldberg and mainly to\nVessiot [19]. The characterization of such class of differential equations is given\nby S. Lie and G. Scheffers in 1893 [12], and it is know as Lie's superposition theorem, or Lie-Scheffers theorem. There is a Lie algebra canonically attached to\n2\n\n\fany non-autonomous differential equation, the so called Lie-Vessiot-Guldberg or\nenveloping algebra. Lie superposition theorem states that a differential equation admit a superposition law if and only if its enveloping algebra is finite\ndimensional. This result, as observed by some contemporary authors (see [3]\nand [6]), is not true in the general case. In fact, Lie theorem characterizes a\nbigger class of differential equations, whichever admit certain invariant foliation\nknown as local superposition law. Here we find the characterization of differential equations admitting superposition laws in the classical sense. In order to\ndo so, we introduce the concepts of Lie-Vessiot systems and pretransitive Lie\ngroup actions. Finally we obtain the whole picture of global superposition laws.\nTheorem 2 (Global Lie). A non-autonomous complex analytic vector field\n~ in a complex analytic manifold M admits a superposition law if and only if\nX\nit is a Lie-Vessiot system related to a pretransitive Lie group action in M .\nUsing this global philosophy it is easy to jump into the algebraic category.\nFirst, is follows easly that rational (id est, given by rational functions of the\ncoordinates) superposition laws lead to rational actions of algebraic groups.\n~ be a non-autonomous meromorphic vector field in an\nTheorem 3 Let X\nalgebraic manifold M that admits a rational superposition law. Then, it is a\nLie-Vessiot system related to an algebraic action of an algebraic group G if M .\nThis result allow us to connect Lie's result with the frame of differential\nGalois theory. The main purpose of differential Galois theory is to classify differential equations with respect to their integrability and reducibility, and of\ncourse, solve those that are integrable. The first step in differential Galois theory is the theory due to Picard and Vessiot that deals with linear differential\nequations. In this frame, there is a correspondence betweend linear differential equations and their differential Galois groups, which are algebraic groups\nof matrixes. Being the Lie-Vessiot systems a natural generalization of linear\nequations, then it is expectable to generalize the differential Galois theory for\nthem. In [10], E. Kolchin gives the theory of strongly normal extensions, a\ngeneralization of Picard-Vessiot theory in which the Galois group are arbitrary\nalgebraic groups. However, this theory deals with differential field extensions\nand not with differential equations. Thus, the connection with superposition\nlaws remained hidden for long time. This connection was first noticed by J. Kovacic, and exposed in a series of lectures (including his conference in Algebraic\nMethods in Dynamical Systems, Barcelona 2008). Here we give this connection\nin a explicit way.\n~ be a non-autonomous meromorphic vector field in an\nTheorem 4 Let X\nalgebraic manifold M with coefficients in the Riemann surface S that admits\na rational superposition law.

Moreover, if G is the algebraic group of transformations in M induced by the superposition law, each\n~ G induce an\nparticular solution \u03c3(t) of the associated automorphic system Ain\n3\n\n\finjective map,\nAutM(S) (L) \u2192 G.\nwhich is an anti-morphism of groups.\n\n2\n\nNon-autonomous Complex Analytic Vector Fields\n\nNotation.

Let us consider a superposition law for X,\n\u03c6 : U \u00d7 M \u2192 M,\n\nU \u2282 M r,\n\n7\n\n\u03c6 = (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ).\n\n\fWe write the general solution,\nx(t) = \u03c6(x(1) (t), . . . , x(r) (t); \u03bb).\n\n(6)\n\nThe local analytic dependency with respect to initial conditions ensures that\n\u2202(\u03c61 ,...\u03c6n )\nthe partial jacobian \u2202(\u03bb\ndoes not vanish. Therefore, at least locally, we\n1 ,...,\u03bbn )\ncan invert with respect to the last variables,\n\u03bb = \u03c8(x(1) (t), . . . , x(r) (t), x(t)).\nFrom that, the components \u03c8i of \u03c8 are first integrals of the lifted vector field\n~ r+1 . We consider the sheaf of rings \u03a8 generated by these functions \u03c8i . This\nX\nis a sheaf of regular rings of dimension n. By construction F\u03a8 is transversal to\nthe fibers of the projection M r \u00d7 M \u2192 M r . We conclude that this sheaf is a\n~ \u0003\nlocal superposition law for X.\n\n4\n\nLocal Superposition Theorem\n\nTheorem 1 ((Local Superposition Theorem [6])) The non-autonomous vec~ in M admits a local superposition law if and only its enveloping\ntor field X\nalgebra is finite dimensional.\nOnce we understand the relation between superposition law and local superposition law, we see that Lie's original proof is still valid. Here we follow\n[12]. However we detail some points that were not explicitly detailed and remain\nobscure in the original proof.\nIt is clear that the finiteness of the enveloping algebra is not a sufficient\ncondition for the existence of a superposition law. It is neccesary to integrate\nthe enveloping algebra into a Lie group action.\nFor instance, any non-linear autonomous vector field has a one dimensional\nenveloping Lie algebra, but it is widely know that the knowldedge of a number\nof integral curves of a generic non-linear vector field do not lead to the general\nsolution. Some people can argue that this case is too degenerated because the\nenveloping algebra of an autonomous vector field is too small in dimension.\nHowever, we can construct of a differential equation in dimension 4, having\nan enveloping Lie algebra of dimension 4 for which no superposition Law is\nexpectable.\nExample 4.1 Let us consider the direct product of the well known Lorentz\nsystem and a Riccati equation\n\u1e8b =\n\n\u03c3(y \u2212 x)\n\n\u1e8f\n\u017c\n\nx(\u03c1 \u2212 z) \u2212 y\nxy \u2212 \u03b2z\n2\n2u\n\u2212 2 \u2212 u2\nt\nt\n\n=\n=\n\nu\u0307 =\n\n8\n\n\fbeing \u03c3, \u03b2, and \u03c1 parameters. We can apply Lie test and we arrive to de\nconclusion that the enveloping algebra is of dimension 4 and have the following\nsystem of generators.\n~1\nX\n\n=\n\n\u03c3(y \u2212 x)\n\n~2\nX\n\n=\n\nu2\n\n~3\nX\n\n=\n\n~4\nX\n\n=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ (x(\u03c1 \u2212 z) \u2212 y)\n+ (xy \u2212 \u03b2z)\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n\n\u2202\n\u2202u\n\u2202\nu\n\u2202u\n\u2202\n\u2202u\n\n~ =X\n~1 \u2212 X\n~2 + 2X\n~\nOur original vector field is X\nt 3 \u2212\nthis system admits a superposition Law,\n\n2 ~\nt2 X4 .\n\nLet us assume that\n\n\u03c6 : (C4 )r \u00d7 C4 \u2192 C4 .\nThe solutions of the Riccati equation in (7) can be easily found, and they turn\n1+2at\nto be of the form u(t) = t(1+at)\nwith a constant. Therefore, the solutions of\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1+2at\nwhere (x(t), y(t), z(t)) is a solution\n(7) are of the form x(t), y(t), z(t), t(1+at)\nof the Lorentz system. By taking suitable values for a1 , . . . , ar , we can put the\ncorresponding solutions of the Riccati equation inside the superposition law,\nproject C4 onto C3 , and we will get a map \u03c6\u0304 of the same kind that \u03c6,\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n1 + 2ai t\n\u03c6\u0304 : (C3 )r \u00d7 C4 \u2192 C3 , (xi , yi , zi , \u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03c0x,y,z \u03c6 xi , yi , zi ,\nt(1 + ai t)\nthat gives us the general solution of the Lorentz system in function of r known\nsolutions and 4 arbitrary constants. Of course, the existence of such a map for\nthe Lorenz atractor equations is not expectable at all.\n\nLocal Superposition Law Implies Finite Dimensional\nEnveloping Algebra\n~ admits a local superposition law \u03a8 in OM r+1 .

We say that\na subset H is a complex analytic subgroup of G if it is both a subgroup and a\ncomplex analytic submanifold of G. In the usual topology, the closure H\u0304 of a\nsubgroup of G is just a Lie subgroup, and it is not in general complex analytic.\nInstead of H\u0304 we consider the complex analytic closure,\n\\\nH\u0303 =\nG\u2032\nG\u2032 complex analytic.\nH\u2282G\u2032\n\nThis is the smaller complex analytic subgroup containing H.\nInvariant Vector Fields\nEach element \u03c3 \u2208 G defines two biholomorphisms of G as complex analytic\nmanifold.

It is quite\ninteresting that right translations are the symmetries of left translations and\nviceversa. This simple fact has amazing consequences in the theory of differential\nequations.\nRemark 5.1 Let f : G \u2192 G be a map. Then, there is an element \u03c3 such that\nf is the right translation R\u03c3 if and only if f commutes with all left translations.\nLet us consider X(G) the space of all regular complex analytic vector fields\nin G.

The\nsame discussion holds for left invariants vector fields. We denote by L(G) the\nLie algebra of left invariants vector fields in G.\nNote that the inversion morphism that sends \u03c3 to \u03c3 \u22121 is an involution that\nconjugates right translations with left translations. Then, it sends right invariant vector fields to left invariant vector fields. Thus, R(G) and L(G) are\nisomorphic Lie algebras.\nExponential Map\n~ \u2208 R(G).

For a point x \u2208 M we denote by Hx the isotropy\nsubgroup of elements of G that let x fixed, and Ox for the orbit G * x of x. Let\nus remind that an action is said to be transitive if there is a unique orbit; it\nis said free if for any point x the isotropy Hx consist of the identity element\ne \u2208 G. The kernel K of the action is the intersection of all isotropy subgroups\n\u2229x\u2208M Hx . It is a normal subgroup of G. The action of G in M is said to be\nfaithful if its kernel consist only of the identity element.\nDefinition 10 A G-space M is a homogeneous G-space if the action of G in\nM is transitive. A principal homogeneous G-space M is a G-space such that the\naction of G in M is free and transitive.\nBy a morphism of G-spaces we mean a morphism f of complex analytic manifolds which commutes with the action of G, f (\u03c3 * x) = \u03c3 f \u0307(x). Whenever it does\nnot lead to confusion we write homogeneous space instead of G-homogeneous\nspace on so on.\nLet M be a G-space. For any x in M the natural map,\nG \u2192 Ox\n\n\u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c3 * x\n\ninduces an isomorphism of Ox with the homogeneous space of cosets G/Hx ; it\nfollows that any homogeneous space is isomorphic to a quotient of G.\nA point x \u2208 M is called a principal point if and only if Hx = {e} if and\nonly if Ox is a principal homogeneous space. In such case we say that Ox is a\nprincipal orbit.\nDefinition 11 For a G-space M we denote by M/G the space orbits of the\naction of G in M .\n\n18\n\n\fThe main problem of the invariant theory is the study of the structure of such\nquotient spaces. In general this space of orbits M/G can have a very complicated\nstructure, and then it should not exist within the category of complex analytic\nmanifolds. This situation is even more complicated in the algebraic case.\nFundamental Vector Fields\n~ of the Lie algebra R(G) can be considered\nLet M be a G-space.

Thus, if the action is faithful then it is injective; its image\nis isomorphic to the quotient R(G)/R (\u2229x\u2208M Hx ).\nDefinition 12 We denote by R(G, M ) the Lie algebra of fundamental vector\nfields of the action of G on M .\nThe flow of fundamental vector fields is given by the exponential map in the\ngroup G:\n~M\n~ * x.\n\u03a6A : C \u00d7 M \u2192 M, (t, x) 7\u2192 exp(tA)\nBasis of an Homogeneous Space\nHere we introduce the concept of basis and rank of homogeneous spaces. This\nconcept has been implicitely used by S. Lie and E. Vessiot in their research on\nsuperposition laws for differential equations. However, we have not found any\nmodern reference on this point. From now on, let us consider an homogeneous\nspace M .\nDefinition 13 Let S be any subset of M .

We denote R(G, M )\nthe Lie algebra of fundamental vector fields of the action of G on M (Definition\n12).\nFor each r \u2208 N, G acts in the cartesian power M r component by component.\nThere is a minimum r such that there are principal orbits in M r . If M is an\nhomogeneous space then this number r is the rank of M (Definition 16).\nDefinition 17 We say that the action of G on M is pretransitive if there exists\nr \u2265 1 and an analytic open subset U \u2282 M r such that:\n(a) U is union of principal orbits.\n(b) The space of orbits U/G is a complex analytic manifold.\nProposition 6 If M is a G-homogeneous space of finite rank, then the action\nof G in M is pretransitive.\nProof. Let r be the rank of M . The set B \u2282 M r of principal points of\nM is an analytic open subset (Proposition 5). Let us see that the space of\norbits B/G is a complex analytic manifold. In order to do so we will construct\nan atlas for B/G. Let us consider the natural projection:\nr\n\n\u03c0 : B \u2192 B/G,\n\nx\u0304 7\u2192 \u03c0(x\u0304) = Ox\u0304 .\n\n21\n\n\fLet us consider x\u0304 \u2208 B; let us construct a coordinate open subset for \u03c0(x\u0304). Ox\u0304 is\na submanifold of B. We take a submanifold L of B such that Ox\u0304 and L intersect\ntransversally in x\u0304,\nTx\u0304 U = Tx\u0304 Ox\u0304 \u2295 Tx\u0304 L.\nLet us prove that there is an polydisc Ux\u0304 , open in L and centered on x\u0304, such\nthat Ox\u0304 \u2229 Ux\u0304 = x\u0304. The action of G on B is continuous and free. So that, if the\nrequired statement statement holds, then there exists a maybe smaller polydisc\nVx\u0304 centered in x\u0304 and open in L such that for all \u0233 \u2208 Vx\u0304 the intersection of O\u0233\nwith Vx\u0304 is reduced to the only point \u0233. Thus, Vx\u0304 projects one-to-one by \u03c0.\n\u223c\n\n\u03c0 : Vx\u0304 \u2212\n\u2192 V\u03c0(x\u0304)\n\n\u0233 7\u2192 \u03c0(\u0233) = O\u0233\n\nV\u03c0(x\u0304) is an open neighborhood of \u03c0(x). The inverse of \u03c0 is an homeomorphism\nof such open subset of B/G with a complex polydisc. In this way we obtain\nan open covering of the space of orbits. Transitions functions are the holonomy\nmaps of the foliation whose leaves are the orbits. Thus, transition functions are\ncomplex analytic and B/G is a complex analytic manifold.\nReasoning by reductio ad absurdum let us assume that there is not a polydisc\nverifying the required hypothesis. Each neighborhood of x in L intersects then\nOx in more than one points.

The action of G is free, so that, for\neach i \u2208 N there is an unique \u03c3i \u2208 G such that \u03c3i (x\u0304i ) = x\u0304. We write these\nr-frames in components,\nx\u0304 = (x(1) , . . . , x(r) ),\n\n(1)\n\n(r)\n\nx\u0304i = (xi , . . . , xi ),\n\nwe have that for all i \u2208 N and k = 1, . . . , r,\n(k)\n\nx(k) = \u03c3i (xi ).\nFor all i \u2208 N and k = 1, . . . , r, let us denote,\n(k)\n\nHx(k) ,x(k) = {\u03c3 \u2208 G | \u03c3 * xi\ni\n\n22\n\n= x(k) },\n\n\f(k)\n\nthe set of all elements of G sending xi to x(k) . This set is the image of the\n(k)\nisotropy group Hx(k) by a right translation in G. When xi is closer to x(k)\nthis translation is closer to the identity. We have,\n\u03c3i \u2282\n\nr\n\\\n\nHx(k) ,x(k) ,\ni\n\nk=1\n\nand from that,\nlim \u03c3i \u2208\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nr\n\\\n\nHx(k) ,\n\nk=1\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nbut this intersection in precisely the isotropy group of x\u0304 and then \u03c3i \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 e.\nOn the other hand there is a neighborhood of x\u0304 in Ox\u0304 that intersects L only\nin x\u0304. So that there is a neighborhood Ue of the identity in G such that Ue * x\u0304\nintersects L only in x\u0304. From certain i0 on, \u03c3i is in Ue , and then \u03c3i = e. Then\nx\u0304i = x\u0304, in contradiction with the hypothesis. \u0003\nRemark 5.3 Pretransitive actions are not uncommon. For example, if M and\nN are G homogeneous spaces of finite rank, then M \u00d7 N is not in general an\nhomogeneous space, but it is clear that it is a pretransitive space.

Then, G inherits this algebraic structure. It is clear that the\ncomposition law and the action are then algebraic. \u0003\n\n8\n\nStrongly Normal Extensions\n\n~ be a non-autonomous meromorphic vector field in an alFrom now on, let X\ngebraic manifold M with coefficients in the Riemann surface S that admits a\nrational superposition law.

Then, superposition laws fall into the differential Galois\ntheory developed in [10].\nThe field M(S) of meromorphic functions in S is a differential field, endowed\nof the derivation \u2202, its field of constants if clearly C. For a differential field K\nwe denote its field of constants by CK . Let K, L be two differential fields.\nBy a differential field morphism we mean a field morphism \u03c6 : K \u2192 L which\n\n30\n\n\fcommutes with the derivation. When we fix a non-trivial (and then injective)\ndifferential field morphism, K \u2282 L we speak of a differential field extension.\nBy a K-isomorphism of L we mean a differential field morphism from L into\na differential field extension of K that fix K pointwise. We will denote by\nAutK (L) the set of differential automorphisms of L that fix K pointwise.\nThe following lema tell us that the vector field X can not have movable\nsingularities.\n~ is holomorphic in M \u00d7S \u00d7\nLemma 6 There is a discrete set R in S such that X\n\u00d7\nbeing S = S \\ R.\ns\nX\n~ i,\n~ =\u03b4+\nfi (t)X\nX\ni=1\n\nbeing the fi (t) meromorphic functions in S with poles in R.\n~ is defined at least at one point of\nProof.

It follows that the fiber t = t0 does not meet\n~\nthe singular locus of X.\n~ should be an union of fibers of the proyection\nThus, the singular locus of X\n~ is\nS \u00d7 M \u2192 S. Those fibers should be isolated, because the vector field X\nmeromorphic. \u0003\n\u00d7 to be the universal\nFrom now on we consider S \u00d7 as above, and we set Sf\n\u00d7\ncovering of S .\n\nLemma 7 Any germ of solution x(t) defined in S \u2032 \u2282 S \u00d7 can be prolonged into\na solution defined in the universal covering Sf\u00d7 of S \u00d7 .\n\nProof. It is enough to see that any solution can be analitically prolongued\nalong any diffentiable path. Let \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 S \u00d7 be a differentiable path. For any\npoint t\u0304 in the image of \u03b3 we consider a simply connected open neighborhood Ut\u0304\nsuch that there exist a fundamental system of solutions xt\u03041 , . . . xt\u0304r defined in Ut\u0304 .\nNow, we apply that the interval [0, 1] is compact, so we can take just a finite\nnumber of open subsets U1 , . . . , Un . In each one of this open subset the general\nsolution exist for any initial condition. So that, we can continue any solution\ndefined around \u03b3(0) along \u03b3 to \u03b3(1). \u0003\n~ defined in Sf\u00d7 . Then, we can consider\nLet x(t) be a particular solution of X\nM(S) \u2282 M(S)hx(t)i, the differential field extension spanned by the coordinates\nof x(t) in any affine chart.\n\n31\n\n\fLemma 8 Let x\u0304(t) = (x1 (t), . . . , xr (t)) be a fundamental system of solutions\n~ and \u03c3(t) a solution of the associated automorphic system A.\n~ Then\nof X,\nM(S)hx\u0304(t)i = M(S)h\u03c3(t)i.\nProof. First, there exist a r-uple \u03bb\u0304 in U such that x\u0304(t) = \u03c3(t) * \u03bb\u0304. Then,\nit is clear that the coordinates of x\u0304(t) are rational functions on the coordinaes\nof \u03c3(t), i. e. M(S)hx\u0304(t)i \u2282 M(S)h\u03c3(t)i. The converse follow from the fact that\nthere is a surjective morphism \u03c0 : U \u2192 G that sends x\u0304(t) to a solution \u03c4 (t) of\n~ Then the coordinates of \u03c4 (t) are, by this proyection, rational funcions of the\nA.\ncoordinates of x\u0304(t) and we have that M(S)h\u03c4 (t)i \u2282 M(S)hx(t)i. Finally, by\nProposition 7 (iii), we know that \u03c4 (t) and \u03c3(t) are related by a left translation\nin G, so that M(S)h\u03c3(t)i coincides witn M(S)h\u03c4 (t)i. \u0003\n~ or equivBy the above Lemma 8 any fundamental system of solutions of X,\n~\nalenty any solution of A span the same differential field extension of M(S).\nThen, we can define:\n~ to the differential field\nDefinition 20 We call the Galois differential field of X\nM(S)hx\u0304(t)i spanned by the coordinates of a fundamental system of solutions\nx\u0304(t), defined in Sf\u00d7 .\n\n~ We have\nFrom now on we denote by L to the Galois differential field of X.\nf\n\u00d7\n~\nthat M(S) \u2282 L \u2282 M(S ). It is clear that if x(t) is a particular solution of X\nthen M(S)hx(t)i is contained in L.\nDefinition 21 Let K be a differential field whose field of constants if C.

Let L be the Galois differenial field of X.\nM(S) \u2282 L is a strongly normal extension in the sense of Kolchin. Moreover,\neach particular solution \u03c3(t) of the associated automorphic system induce an\ninjective map,\nAutM(S) (L) \u2192 G.\nwhich is an anti-morphism of groups.\nProof. We consider, as above, \u03c3(t) a solution of the associated automorphic system, so that L = M(S)h\u03c3(t)i. Let F : L \u2192 U be a M(S)-isomorphism.\nThen, acting coordinate by coordinate F (\u03c3(t)) is an element of G with coordinates in U. Let us recall F fixes M(S) pointwise, we have that the coordinates\n32\n\n\fF (\u03c3(t)) satisfy all the differential equations satisfied by the coordinates of \u03c3(t)\n~ Let us denote\nwith coefficients in M(S). Then F (\u03c3(t)) is a solution of A.\nF (\u03c3(t)) = \u03c4 (t).\nBy the properties of automorphic systems, we have that \u03c3(t)\u22121 * \u03c4 (t) which\nis an element of G with coordinates in U is constant, that is, its coordinates are\nin CU . Let us call it \u03bb = \u03c3(t)\u22121 * \u03c4 (t). Then, we have L * \u03c3L \u2282 L(\u03bb) \u2282 L * CU ,\nand we conclude that M(S) \u2282 L is a strongly normal extension.\nLet us construct the anti-morphism of groups above stated. We fix the\n~ Let F be a K-automorphism of L. By the above argusolution \u03c3(t) of A.\n~ so that there exist a unique \u03bbF such that\nment F (\u03c3(t)) is also a solution of A,\nF (\u03c3(t)) = \u03c3(t) * \u03bbF . Then we define:\n\u03a6\u03c3 : AutM(S) (L) \u2192 G,\n\nF \u2192 \u03bbF .\n\nIf we consider a pair of automorphisms F, and G, we have:\nF (G(\u03c3(t)) = F (\u03c3(t)) * \u03bbG ) = \u03c3(t) * \u03bbF \u03bbG ,\nso that it is clear that it is anti-morphism. Finally, for proving that this map\nis injective it suffices to recall that \u03c3(t) spans L. Thus, if an automorphism let\n\u03c3(t) fixed then it is the identity. \u0003\nRemark 8.1 This problem was also apprached in a purely algebraic way, with\nno explicit relation with superposition laws.
