On one\n\nhand these extremely high magneti\n\n\u001duxes are not observed in the solar\n\natmosphere, on the other hand the \u001duxes of energeti\n\nele trons dedu ed\n\nfrom the hard X-ray observations (e.g., RHESSI ) are related with su h high\nele tri\n\nurrents of the order of\n\n\u001celds indu ed in the\n\n1017 A.
