In order to make meaningful predictions about such systems\none can consider statistical ensembles that represent different realizations of the couplings.\nFor a particular realization of the couplings one is generally interested in finding algorithms\nto determine properties such as the spectrum, partition function, the ground-state or the\nground-state energy. Algorithms with a running time that is a polynomial in the problem\nsize are called efficient, in contrast with inefficient procedures that take super-polynomial or\nexponential running times. Connections between disordered systems in statistical physics and\nquestions of computational complexity have been extensively explored, see e.g. [2] and [3].\nIn this paper we find a new application of computational complexity tools to spin glass\nproblems, namely a rigorous approximation algorithm to determine the ground-state energy of\na classical or quantum Ising spin glass on a planar graph. It has been shown that to determine\nthe ground-state energy of a classical Ising spin glass on a 2D lattice with linear terms exactly\nis computationally hard, or NP-complete [4]. Terhal and Oliveira showed that determining\nthe smallest eigenvalue of a quantum Ising spin glass of n qubits on a planar graph with\n1/poly(n) accuracy is QMA-complete [5]. Aharonov et al. [6] showed that even determining\nthe smallest eigenvalue for qudits on a line is QMA-complete. Therefore the running time of\nany algorithm for computing the ground state energy exactly must scale super-polynomially\n\u2217 IBM\n\nWatson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA 10598. nikhil@us.ibm.com\nWatson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA 10598. sbravyi@us.ibm.com\n\u2021 IBM Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA 10598. bterhal@gmail.com\n\n\u2020 IBM\n\n1\n\n\fwith the number of spins n (under the assumption P6=NP). Thus it is natural to look for\napproximation algorithms that solve the problem in polynomial time at the cost of providing\na slightly non-optimal solution.\nLet us define the (quantum) Ising spin glass problem precisely. Let G = (V, E) denote any\ngraph with n vertices and let u, v \u2208 V be vertices of the graph. One can associate a 2-local\nIsing spin glass Hamiltonian H with interaction graph G = (V, E),\nX\nX\nQu,v +\nLu = Q + L.\n(1)\nH=\nu\u2208V\n\n(u,v)\u2208E\n\nHere Qu,v is quadratic in Pauli operators and Lu is linear. We assume that ||Qu,v ||, ||Lu || \u2264\npoly(n). It is also assumed that Tr H = 0. We obtain the classical Ising spin glass, the\nfunction H(S), by setting Qu,v = cuv Su Sv and Lu = du Su for classical spins Su = {\u22121, 1},\ni.e.\nX\nX\nH(S) =\ncuv Su Sv +\ndu Su\n(2)\nu,v\n\nu\n\nIn the classical case cuv and du can be given as some m-bit numbers. Bieche et al. [7] has\nshown that for planar graphs G the problem of determining the minimum value of H(S) (the\nground-state energy) and the associated assignment S can be solved efficiently if there are no\nlinear terms (i.e. all du = 0).\nOur approximation algorithm for the classical and quantum Ising spin glass is relevant\nin light of the recent research on quantum adiabatic approaches for finding the ground-state\nof a classical or quantum Ising spin glass and solving other NP-complete problems. The\nparadigm of adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) was first introduced in [8]. An adiabatic\ncomputation proceeds by slowly varying the system's Hamiltonian starting from some simple\nHamiltonian H0 at the time t = 0 and arriving to, for example, a classical Ising spin glass\nHamiltonian H at t = T (the final Hamiltonian can also capture other NP-hard problems).\nThe adiabatic theorem, see e.g. [9], guarantees that if one starts from the ground state of H0\nand the running time T is large compared to the inverse spectral gap at all times then the\nfinal state is close the ground-state of H.\nIf we assume the validity of the conjecture that a quantum computer can not solve NPcomplete nor QMA-complete problems (see for classical spin glasses the analysis in [10, 11]) it\nfollows that AQC is a means to obtain an approximation to the ground-state and the groundstate energy. The quality of this approximation and its dependence on the hardness of the\nproblem and the adiabatic path are at present not well understood. Some experiments on\na physical realization of the classical Ising model in a transverse field show that quantum\nannealing can lead to faster equilibration of the system [12]. Also, it was recently shown that\na quantum algorithm can provide a square-root speed-up over a classical simulated annealing\nalgorithm [13]. These results do not show that the Ising spin glass problem becomes easy\non a quantum computer, but point to possible advantages of using a quantum computer to\nobtain efficient approximation algorithms. Recently the company D-wave has claimed to have\nimplemented the Ising spin glass Hamiltonian (with additional edges on the diagonals of the\nlattice) and an adiabatic evolution for 16 qubits on a 4 \u00d7 4 square lattice, see [14]. The hope of\nthis endeavor is that such system outperforms classical computers in (approximately) solving\noptimization problems.\nGiven these claims and results about quantum speed-ups it is clearly interesting to consider\nhow well an approximation to the ground-state energy can be obtained by purely classical\nalgorithmic means.\n2\n\n\fThe area of approximation algorithms is an active area of research in computer science,\nsee e.g. [15]. Such algorithms are often of practical importance for generic hard problems\nfor which we are willing to trade off the relative quality of the approximation versus the\nrunning time of the algorithm. Three main types of approximations to optimization problems\ncan be distinguished. A problem is said to have a polynomial time approximation scheme\n(PTAS) if given any \u01eb > 0, there is an algorithm A\u01eb which for any instance I produces a\nsolution within (1 \u00b1 \u01eb) times the optimal solution. In addition A\u01eb has a running time which\nis a polynomial in the input size of I. Observe that the running time of a PTAS is only\nrequired to be polynomial in input size, and it can have an arbitrary dependence on \u01eb (for\nexample n1/\u01eb or 21/\u01eb poly(n) are valid running times for a PTAS). A stronger notion is that\nof a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), where the running time of the\napproximation scheme is required to be polynomial both in the size of the input and in (1/\u01eb).\nFor the classical Ising spin glass problem an instance is a particular graph and set of values\nof the weights cuv and du . The optimal solution is the minimum value of the energy H(S).\nFor the Ising spin glass problem on planar graphs, we can exclude the possibility of a\nFPTAS (assuming P 6= NP). This is due to the fact that the problem is NP-hard even when\ncuv , du are restricted to be either \u22121, 0 or +1 [4]. Let us assume that we have a FPTAS and\nset \u01eb = \u03b4/poly(n) for some constant \u03b4. This gives a polynomial-time algorithm to approximate\nminS H(S) with an error which is at most \u03b4 minS H(S)/poly(n). This is sufficient accuracy\nto solve the NP-complete problem exactly since H(S) is at most poly(n) and the difference\nbetween the minimum of H(S) and the value right above it (i.e. the energy gap) is at least\n1, that is, independent of n.\nA class of classical optimization problems for which the objective function can be efficiently\napproximated with a relative error \u01eb for some fixed \u01eb is called APX. It is known that some\nproblems in APX do not have a PTAS (under the assumption P6=NP), for example, Minimum\nVertex Cover and Maximum Cut problems, see [16]. In other words, for such problems no\npolynomial-time algorithm can make the relative error smaller than some constant threshold\nvalue \u01eb0 . Problems having this property are called APX-hard. One can use the relation\nbetween the Ising spin glass problem and the Maximum Cut problem, see [17], to show that\nthe former is APX-hard if defined on arbitrary graphs. This is the reason why the present\npaper focuses only on planar graphs.\nNote that the existence of a PTAS for a Hamiltonian H does not imply the existence\nof a PTAS for the trivially related problem of finding the ground-state energy of H + aI,\nwhere a is a constant; this is because the PTAS produces a solution with small relative error.\nOur PTAS for the quantum and classical Ising spin glass problem can bePtranslated to an\napproximation algorithm with an absolute error at most \u01ebW , where W = (u,v) ||Quv || (see\ne.g. Eq. (6) for the classical error analysis). Clearly, while comparing the quality of an\napproximation obtained using AQC and the classical PTAS the relevant figure of merit must\nbe an absolute error, because the Hamiltonians H and H + aI are physically equivalent. Note\nthat when we state our running times for the approximation algorithms, we state the worstcase running time depending on some guaranteed error-bound. In practice, running times\nmay be much faster if heuristic methods are used within the approximation algorithm. Such\nheuristic methods cannot guarantee an error-bound, but may work well for average-case or\n'real-life' instances.\nWe will first consider the classical Ising spin glass on a graph G which is a two-dimensional\n1\nlattice, and give a PTAS for this case. It has a running time T = O(n4 \u01eb ), see Section 2.1. The\nintuitive idea behind this construction is simple. Assume, for simplicity, that all couplings\nbetween spins have similar strength. Then one can subdivide a 2D lattice into blocks of size\n3\n\n\fL \u00d7 L by omitting the edges connecting these subblocks. The total contribution of these\nomitted boundary edges scales as 4L \u00d7 Ln2 = O(n/L) and hence for large, but constant,\nL = 1/\u01eb the error that one makes by omitting these edges is bounded by at most O(\u01ebn). This\nproves that there exists an approximation algorithm with absolute error. However one can\nshow that the ground-state energy scales with n (see e.g. the rigorous Theorem 1) and thus\nthe error will be proportional to the ground-state energy which is exactly what is desired for\nthe PTAS.\nIn our formulation of the problem, not all edges on the 2D lattice have similar strength,\nhence somewhat more elaborate arguments are needed to show the existence of a PTAS.\nFor general planar graph this situation is more involved. Vertices in the graph can have\narbitrary high degree and\nwith small\nP it is not clear how to divide up the graph into sub-blocksP\nboundaries. Let W = (u,v) ||Qu,v || for the quantum Isin spin glass and W = (u,v) |cuv |\nfor the classical Isin spin glass, see the definitions of the Hamiltonians in Eqs. (1,2). In the\n'classical' Theorem 1 and its quantum counterpart, Theorem 2, we will show that the groundstate energy of an Ising spin glass on a planar graph is less than \u2212cW for some constant\nc. This rigorously expresses the intuitive physical notion that the ground-state energy is\nextensive in the system size n. The idea of the PTAS is then as follows. We take out a\nsubset of edges in the planar graph for which (i) one can show that they contribute at most\n\u01ebW to the Hamiltonian and (ii) by taking out these edges one ends up with a set of simpler\ndisconnected graphs on which one can solve the problem efficiently (in poly(n)2O(1/\u01eb) time).\nLet H\u0303 denote the (classical or quantum) Hamiltonian for the problem where we have taken out\nthese edges. Since we only take out edges (and no vertices), a state with minimum energy for\nH\u0303 is also a state for H. Let \u03bb(H) denote the ground-state energy of H. By Weyl's inequality\n|\u03bb(H) \u2212 \u03bb(H\u0303)| \u2264 ||H \u2212 H\u0303|| \u2264 \u01ebW . Using Theorems 1 and 2 we can relate W back to the\nlowest eigenvalue of H and hence show that the PTAS outputs a (quantum) state which has\nenergy at most O(\u01eb\u03bb(H)) higher than the true ground-state energy.\nHow do we take out edges from the original planar graph? In the classical case, see\nSection 2.5, we take out edges related to a so-called outerplanar decomposition of a graph. In\nthis way we end up with disconnected graphs which have a constant tree-width. It is known\nhow to solve the classical spin problem on graphs with bounded tree-width (using dynamic\nprogramming).\nIn the quantum case we cannot chose this procedure since the quantum problem on a\ngraph with bounded-tree width, or even on a tree, can still be hard, see [6]. This points to\nan interesting difference between the quantum and the classical Isin spin glass.\nIf, in the quantum case, we restrict ourselves to graphs with bounded-degree, we can\napply a procedure that removes edges and leaves a set of disconnected graphs each of which\nhas constant size (related to \u01eb), see Section 3.1. Determining the ground-state energy of a\nHamiltonian in a space of constant dimension can be done classically. Note that this PTAS\noutputs a classical description of a quantum state which has an energy O(\u01eb\u03bb(H))-close to the\ntrue ground-state energy.\nOur last result finds a PTAS for the quantum problem on a star graph, see Section 4.\nThe complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem on this graph is not known. For the star\ngraph it is not clear how to take out edges without introducing a large error. Hence we will\nuse a different technique which uses symmetry and the rounding of interactions. In effect, we\nconstruct a Hamiltonian H\u0303 for which \u03bb(H\u0303) and its ground-state can be determined efficiently\nand ||H \u2212 H\u0303|| \u2264 \u01ebW . The construction works as long as all terms in H have norms in a\nrange [a, 1] for a constant a. Such condition was not present in the other PTAS constructions.\nExtensions of this technique may be important for addressing the general quantum problem\n4\n\n\fon planar graphs.\nWe note that our technique for the classical planar graph problem, i.e. using an outerplanar\ndecomposition of the graph, is fairly standard for solving hard classical problems on planar\ngraphs. In fact, many problems admit a PTAS on planar graphs even though approximating\nthem on general graphs is known to be NP-hard, see [18, 19, 20]. While our techniques are\nsimilar to those of [19] and [20] at a conceptual level, our results do not follow directly from\ntheir work and require some new ideas. The main difficulty is that the Hamiltonian involves\nboth positive and negative terms which can possibly cancel out.\n2\n\nClassical Hamiltonians on planar graphs\n\n2.1 The 2D Lattice Case\nConsider\n\u221a the\n\u221a classical Ising spin glass Hamiltonian Eq. (2) defined on a 2D square lattice of\nsize n \u00d7 n. Let \u01eb > 0 be a fixed small constant. Without loss of generality let us assume\nthat t = 1/\u01eb is an integer. For i = 0, . . . , t \u2212 1, let Xi denote the set of vertices u = (x, y) on\nthe horizontal lines defined by {y \u2261 i (modulo t) }. Similarly, let Yi denote the set of vertices\non the vertical lines defined by { x \u2261 i (modulo t) }, see Figure 1. We define the Hamiltonians\nHix (S) and Hjy (S) as follows. Hix includes all terms du Su , u \u2208 Xi and all terms cuv Su Sv\nsuch that (u, v) is a vertical edge that has exactly one end-point in Xi . Similarly Hjy includes\nall terms du Su for u \u2208 Yj and and all terms cuv Su Sv such that (u, v) is a horizontal edge\nPt\u22121\nthat has exactly one end-point in Yj . It is easy to see that i=0 Hix (S) + Hiy (S) = 2H(S)\u2217.\nThis implies that there exists an i and b = x or y such that Hib (Sopt ) \u2265 H(Sopt )/t or\nH(Sopt ) \u2212 Hib (Sopt ) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)H(Sopt ), where Sopt is a spin configuration with the minimum\nenergy.\nj\n\nj+t\n\nj+2t\n\ni\n\ni+t\n\ni+2t\nFig. 1. Sets of vertices on horizontal lines Xi and sets of vertices at vertical lines Yj . Drawn are\nalso some vertical edges that are part of Hix and horizontal edges that are part of Hjy .\nb\nFor any i and b = x, y consider a Hamiltonian Hsub,i\n(S) = H(S) \u2212 Hib (S). Note that\n\u221a\nthis \u221a\nHamiltonian\ndescribes the Ising model defined\non a set of \u01eb n disconnected strips of size\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\nn and \u01eb n disconnected lines of size n. The latter corresponds to sets of edges that\n\u01eb \u00d7\nb\nhave both endpoints in Xi or Yi and thus contains no linear terms. It means that Hsub,i\n(S)\nis invariant under flipping all the spins in any connected component of Xi (if b = x) or Yi (if\nb = y). Besides, as shown in the previous paragraph, there exists a choice of i and b such that\nb\nHsub,i\n(Sopt ) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)H(Sopt ).\n\u2217We\n\nnote that a similar decomposition could be obtained for qubits on the square lattice with additional\ndiagonal interactions. In such case we would define four Hamiltonians corresponding to lines of vertical,\nhorizontal, diagonal-\\, and diagonal-/ vertices with the edges incident on these vertices.\n\n5\n\n\f\u2032\nb\nLet Sopt\nbe a spin configuration that achieves the minimum of Hsub,i\n(S) for some fixed i\n\u2032\nand b. Note that Sopt assigns values to all the vertices of the lattice. Using the symmetry\nb\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof Hsub,i\n(S) mentioned above, one can choose Sopt\nsuch that Hib (Sopt\n) \u2264 0. Indeed, if b = x\nx\n\u2032\nx\nthen Hi (Sopt ) changes a sign under flipping all the spins in Xi while Hsub,i\n(S) is invariant\nunder this flip (the same argument applies to b = y). Therefore, for any i and b one has\n\u2032\nb\n\u2032\nb\n\u2032\nb\nH(Sopt ) \u2264 H(Sopt\n) \u2264 Hsub,i\n(Sopt\n) and for some i and b one has Hsub,i\n(Sopt\n) \u2264 Hsub,i\n(Sopt ) \u2264\nb\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)H(Sopt ). Thus the minimum energy of Hsub,i (S) over all i, b, and S approximates\nH(Sopt ) within a factor 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\nb\nIt follows that we can get a PTAS by finding the minimum of Hsub,i\n(S) over all choices\nof i = 0,\u0002 . . . , t \u2212\u221a1, b = x, y, and\u221aall spin\nconfigurations\nS.\nThe\nrunning\ntime\nof this PTAS is\n\u0003\n\u221a\nT = 2\u01eb * Tstrip ( n, 1\u01eb ) + Tstrip ( n, 1) * O(\u01eb n), where Tstrip (r, s) is the running time needed\nto find the optimal solution for the Ising spin glass Hamiltonian on a r \u00d7 s strip. One can\neasily show that\nLemma 1 There is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimum solution\nfor a r \u00d7 s lattice-blocks using space O(2s ) and time O(r4s ).\nProof: Let Bi denote the lattice B restricted to row i or less (Br = B). Let S be {\u22121, +1}\nvector of size s and for i \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, let V (i, S) be the optimum value of the Hamiltonian\nrestricted to Bi such that the variables on the i-th row have assignment S. The dynamic\nprogram computes and stores V (i, S) for all i and S starting sequentially from i = 1. This\nsuffices as the optimum solution for B is exactly minS V (r, S).\nFor i = 1, the quantity V (1, S) can be easily computed for each S. Suppose V (i, S) has\nbeen computed and stored for all S. For an assignment S of row i + 1 and an assignment S \u2032 of\nrow i, let Z(i + 1, S, S \u2032) denote the contribution of all terms to the Hamiltonian corresponding\nto vertices on row i + 1, and edges in Bi+1 with at least one end point in row i + 1. Since the\nassignment S on row i + 1 can only affect Z, it follows that\n\nV (i + 1, S) = min\n(V (i, S \u2032 ) + Z(i + 1, S, S \u2032 )).\n\u2032\nS\n\n(3)\n\nSince Z(i + 1, S, S \u2032 ) can be computed in time O(s) and V (i, S \u2032 ) are already stored, computing\nV (i + 1, S) for all S takes time O(s2s *2s ). We can speed up this procedure somewhat to O(4s )\nby considering the assignments S \u2032 in say the Gray code order (where successive assignments\ndiffer in exactly 1 variable), and hence only O(1) work needs to be done per assignment S \u2032 .\n\u2737\nThus using the dynamic program leads to a PTAS with an overall running time T =\n1\nO(n4 \u01eb ).\n2.2 Quantum Speed-Up?\nLet us consider how a quantum computer could improve these running times. A possible\napplication of quantum searching is inside the dynamic programming. Since many classical\napproximation algorithms rely on dynamic programming, this could be an important area of\napplications for quantum searching. For each row of s spins the dynamic program performs\n2s minimizations and the minimum is over a function which takes 2s values. There exists\na quantum algorithm for finding the minimum of a function [21] which provides a squareroot speed-up over a brute-force classical minimization. This algorithm uses the Grover\nsearch algorithm as a subroutine. However in the dynamic program, part of the input to this\nfunction is stored which implies that this is a problem of searching in a real database. In\nthe database setting one has to consider the additional time/hardware overhead in accessing\nthe spatially extended database. Optical or classical wave implementations of this type of\n6\n\n\fsearching have been considered, see [22]. Whether this application of Grover's algorithm in\ndynamic programming is of genuine interest will depend how its physical implementation\ncompetes in practice with the capabilities of classical computers.\nAn alternative, less efficient, way to divide up the lattice is to remove edges that connect\nsubblocks of L \u00d7 L spins. This leads to a classical approximation algorithm with running\n2\ntime O(2O(1/\u01eb ) ). In this scenario, a direct quantum search algorithm can help in finding the\nminimum energy of each block, but note that this quadratic improvement would still lead to a\n2\nrunning time which scales as 2O(1/\u01eb ) which is worse than the dynamic programming method.\n2.3 General Planar Graphs\nLet us now consider the general case of planar graphs. In the lattice case we used the symmetry\nof the lattice to argue that there exists a small subset of edges such that they have a small\ncontribution to the Hamiltonian and removing them decomposes the lattice into small disjoint\nblocks. For general planar graphs we cannot use this argument due to the lack of symmetry\nand hence we argue indirectly. We show that the magnitude of the optimal solution is at\nleast a constant fraction of the sum of the absolute values of quadratic terms corresponding\nto the edges. This allows us to find a subset of edges with relatively small weight such that\nremoving them decomposes the graph into simpler disjoint graphs for which the problem can\nbe solved directly. Since the removed edges have small weight adding them back in does not\nincrease the Hamiltonian by too much, irrespective of whether they are satisfied or not.\n2.4 Main theorem and Its Proof\nP\nFor a planar graph G = (V, E) let W = (u,v)\u2208E |cuv |. The key to our PTAS is the following\nresult that shows that the value of the optimal assignment scales linearly with W :\nTheorem 1 If G is planar, then H(Sopt ) \u2264 \u2212W/3.\nWe begin with a simple property of the optimal solution (the one that minimizes H(S))\nthat holds for an arbitrary graph. Let us write the Hamiltonian as H(S) = Q(S) + L(S),\nwhere Q(.) is the contribution of the quadratic (2-local) terms and L(.) is the contribution of\nthe linear (1-local) terms.\nClaim 1 There exists an optimal\nsolution Sopt such that H(Sopt ) \u2264 0 and L(Sopt ) \u2264 0.\nP\nProof: It is clear that S H(S) = 0 (this is the traceless condition). This implies that\nthere must exist a spin configuration with negative energy and thus H(Sopt ) is negative. The\nsecond part can be argued by assuming the contrary (L(Sopt ) > 0) and then noting that the\nsolution with opposites signs \u2212Sopt is better than Sopt itself. \u2737\nThus we note that it suffices to show that minS Q(S) \u2264 \u2212W/3 since Claim 1 shows that\nminS H(S) \u2264 minS Q(S). Hence we consider planar graphs with only quadratic terms in\nH(S), i.e. we assume that du = 0 for all u. Recall that Bieche et al. [7] has shown that this\nproblem can be solved exactly in polynomial time. Our proof of Theorem 1 builds on the\nideas of Bieche and so we first describe these ideas. We begin with some notation.\nA graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane such that no edges cross. This drawing\ndefines disjoint regions in the plane that are called faces. A cycle in a graph is a collection of\nedges (u1 , u2 ), (u2 , u3 ), . . . , (ul\u22121 , ul ) where ul = u1 . Given two cycles C1 and C2 , their sum\nC1 \u2295 C2 is defined as the symmetric difference of C1 and C2 . The faces of planar graph form\na cycle basis, that is, every cycle can be expressed as a sum of faces. Given an assignment S,\nan edge (u, v) is called unsatisfied if u and v are not assigned according the sign of cuv (i.e. if\ncuv \u2265 0 but Su Sv = 1 or if cuv < 0 but Su Sv = \u22121). A face F is called frustrated if it contains\nan odd number of edges with positive weight. A key observation is that for any assignment, a\nfrustrated face must always contain an odd number (hence at least one) of unsatisfied edges.\n7\n\n\fConversely, if J is a subset of edges such that each frustrated (resp. non-frustrated) face\ncontains exactly an odd (resp. even) number of edges in J, then there is anP\nassignment S\nsuch that the unsatisfied edges are exactly those in J. Thus, Q(S) = \u2212W + 2 (u,v)\u2208J |cuv |.\nBieche et al. [7] showed that for planar graphs finding such a set J with minimum weight\nis equivalent to finding the minimum weight T -join in the dual graph G\u2217 (these terms are\ndefined below). Let us remark that the total number of frustrated faces is even because each\nedge (u, v) with cu,v > 0 has exactly two adjacent faces.\nFor a planar graph G, its dual graph G\u2217 is defined as follows: G\u2217 has a vertex for each face\nin G. Vertices u and v in G\u2217 are connected by an edge if and only if the faces corresponding\nto u and v in G share a common edge. Given a G, the dual G\u2217 is not necessarily unique (it\ndepends on the drawing of G), however G\u2217\u2217 = G. A subset of edges E \u2032 is called a cut-set\nif removing them disconnects the graph into two or more components. For planar graphs,\nevery cut-set in the dual graph G\u2217 corresponds to a cycle in G. We shall see below that sets\nof unsatisfied edges J in G can be identified with T -joins in the dual graph G\u2217 , where T is a\nset of frustrated faces.\nLet G = (V, E) be a graph with edge weights, and let T be a subset of vertices T \u2286 V\nsuch that |T | is even. A T -join is a collection of edges J such that each vertex in T is adjacent\nto an odd number of edges in J and each vertex in V \\ T is adjacent to an even number of\nedges in J. The minimum weighted T -join problem is to find a T -join with minimum weight,\nand this can be found in polynomial time using matchings. As we mentioned above finding\nthe optimal assignment is equivalent to finding the minimum weight T -join in G\u2217 where T\nto be the set of vertices corresponding to the frustrated faces in G, and where an edge e\ncorresponding to (u, v) in G has weight w(e) = |cuv |.\nWe will use a polyhedral description of T -joins. For a subset of edges J, let v(J) denote\nthe corresponding |E|-dimensional incidence vector (with 1 in the i-th coordinate if edge i\nlies in J and 0 otherwise). For a subset of vertices X, let \u03b4(X) denote the set of edges with\none end point in X and other in V \\ X. Given a graph G and the set T , we say that a subset\nof edges J is an upper T -join if some subset J \u2032 of J is a T -join for G. Let P be the convex\nhull of all vectors v(J) corresponding to the incidence vector of upper T -joins. P is called the\nup-polyhedra of T -joins. Edmonds and Johnson [23] gave the following exact description of\nP (see the book by Schrijver [24], Chapter 29, par. 1-6 for further details).\nX\nx(e) \u2265 1, for all sets X s.t. |X \u2229 T | is odd,\n(4)\ne\u2208\u03b4(W )\n\n0 \u2264 x(e) \u2264 1\n\nfor all edges e.\n\n(5)\n\nThis implies that any feasible solution x to the P\nsystem of inequalities above can P\nbe written\nas a convex combination of upper T -joins, i.e. x = \u03b1i v(Ji ) where 0 \u2264 \u03b1i \u2264 1 and i \u03b1i = 1.\nIn particular this implies that\nCorollary 1 If all the edge weights w(e) are non-negative, then given any feasible\nP assignment\nx(e) satisfying the inequalities above, there exists a T -join with cost at most e w(e)x(e).\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 1.\nLemma 2 Let G be a simple (with no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices) planar\ngraph with weights |cuv | on the edges, and let G\u2217 be its dual graph. For any subset\nP of vertices T\nof G\u2217 such that |T | is even, the minimum weighted T -join has weight at most ( (u,v) |cuv |)/3.\nProof: Each cut-set J of G\u2217 corresponds to a cycle in G. Since G is simple, each cycle has\nlength at least 3, and hence each cut-set J of G\u2217 contains at least 3 edges. Consider the\n\n8\n\n\fassignment x(e) = 1/3. It clearly satisfies Eq. (5). Moreover it also satisfies Eq. (4) as\n\u03b4(X) \u2265 3 for all X \u2282 V , X =\n6 V . The result then follows from Corollary 1.\n\u2737\nLemma 2 implies Theorem 1 immediately, since the value of the optimal assignment is \u2212W\nplus twice the weight of the optimal T -join which is at most \u2212W + 2W/3 = \u2212W/3. Observe\nthat Theorem 1 is tight, as seen from the example where G is a triangle with edge weights\n+1, +1 and \u22121. Here W = 3, but the optimal spin assignment has value \u22121. The condition\nthat G is simple is necessary. Otherwise, consider the graph on two vertices with two edges,\none with weight \u22121 and other with weight +1. Here W = 2, but the optimal assignment has\nvalue 0.\n2.5 The Approximation Algorithm\nGiven Theorem 1, the PTAS follows using some ideas in [20]. We begin by describing the\nnotions of p-outerplanar graphs and tree-widths. An outerface of a planar graph drawn in the\nplane is the set of edges that constitute the boundary of the drawing. For a tree, the outerface\nis the set of all the edges. An outerplanar or 1-outerplanar graph is a planar graph that has\nan embedding in the plane with all vertices appearing on the outerface. Hence examples of\n1-outerplanar graphs are trees or the graph consisting of two cycles that share a common\nvertex. One can define a p-outerplanar graph recursively as (see the example in Figure 2):\nDefinition 2 (p-outerplanar graphs) A p-outerplanar graph is a planar graph that has an\nembedding in the plane such that removing all the vertices on the outer face gives a (p \u2212 1)outerplanar graph.\n\nFig. 2. A planar graph which is drawn as a 4-outerplanar graph.\n\nThe notion of tree decompositions (TD) was introduced by Robertson and Seymour [25],\nsee also [20, 26]. Roughly speaking, a TD allows one to map the Ising spin Hamiltonian H(S)\non a graph G = (V, E) to a new spin Hamiltonian Htree (\u0398) that depends on spins \u0398t \u2208 {0, 1}b\nliving at vertices t of some tree T . The spin \u0398t represents the \"opinion\" that a vertex t has\nabout value of spins Su in some subset of vertices Bt \u2286 V called a bag. Accordingly, \u0398t\nmay take 2b values, where b is the number of spins in Bt . Suppose we can form m bags\nB1 , . . . , Bm \u2286 V associated with the m vertices of T such that (i) every vertex u \u2208 V is\ncontained in some bag Bt ; (ii) for every edge (u, v) \u2208 E, some bag Bt contains both u and v;\n(iii) a set of bags containing any given vertex of G forms a subtree of T . These data specify\na TD of G with a size m and a tree-width b \u2212 1. The rules (i),(ii) guarantee that one can\ndistribute the terms cuv Su Sv and du Su of the Hamiltonian H(S) over the bags B1 , . . . , Bm\nsuch that every\none bag. This distribution defines Hamiltonians\nP\nP term appears in exactly\nHtree,t (\u0398t ) = (u,v)\u2208Bt cuv Su Sv + u\u2208Bt du Su , where the spins Su are determined by \u0398t .\nPm\nDefine Htree (\u0398) = t=1 Htree,t (\u0398t ). For every edge (s, t) \u2208 E(T ) let us say that \u0398s and\n\u0398t are consistent on (s, t) iff their opinions about any spin u \u2208 Bs \u2229 Bt agree. The rule\n(iii) guarantees that \u0398 is consistent with some spin configuration S iff (\u0398s , \u0398t ) are consistent\n9\n\n\fon every edge of T . Accordingly, minS H(S) = min\u2032\u0398 Htree (\u0398), where min\u2032 means that the\nconsistency condition on every edge of T is imposed. The optimal solution \u0398 can be found very\nefficiently using the standard dynamic programming approach since the problem is defined\non a tree. It requires a running time of O(m4b ), see [26].\nIt is known that a p-outerplanar graph has a TD with a size m = 2n \u2212 1 and a tree-width\nat most 3p \u2212 1. Such a TD can be computed in time O(pn), see [27]. Summarizing, the\nminimum energy of the Ising spin glass Hamiltonian on a p-outerplanar graph with n vertices\ncan be found in time T = O(n26p ).\nOur algorithm works as follows. Given the planar graph G, one first constructs a drawing\nof G in the plane. This can be done in linear time, using for example the algorithm of Hopcroft\nand Tarjan [28]. This gives an outerplanar decomposition of G, see e.g. Fig 2. Say it is houterplanar (h could be as large as O(n)). Partition the vertices into levels V1 , . . . , Vh where\nV1 is the outer face and Vi is the outer face obtained by removing V1 , . . . , Vi\u22121 . Let Ei be a\nset of edges that go from Vi to Vi+1 . For j = 0, . . . , t \u2212 1, let Gj be the union of sets Ei for all\ni = j (modulo t). (Recall that t \u2261 1/\u01eb.) As each edge lies in at most one set Gj , there exists\nsome index j such that the sum of |cuv | over all edges in Gj is at most \u01ebC. Remove all the\nedges in Gj from the graph G. This decomposes G into a disjoint collection of t-outerplanar\ngraphs F1 , F2 , . . . , F\u01ebh . We find the minimum energy separately on each of these subgraphs.\nNow consider thePquality of the solution obtained for the decomposed problem. Let\n\u2032\n. By\nHsub,j (S) = H(S) \u2212 (u,v)\u2208Gj cuv Su Sv and let the optimal solution for Hsub,j be Sopt\nthe reasoning above there exists j such that\n\u2032\nHsub,j (Sopt\n) \u2264 Hsub,j (Sopt ) \u2264 H(Sopt ) + \u01ebW.\n\n(6)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n) \u2264 H(Sopt )+2\u01ebW \u2264 (1\u22126\u01eb)H(Sopt )\n)+\u01ebW . Thus H(Sopt\n) \u2264 Hsub,j (Sopt\nFurthermore, H(Sopt\nby Theorem 1. It follows that we can get a PTAS with a relative error 6\u01eb by trying all possible\n\u2032\n\u2032\nj = 0, . . . , t\u22121 and choosing the optimal solution Sopt\nthat yields the smallest value of H(Sopt\n).\nP\n\u01ebh\n\u2032\n6t\n6t\nFor a fixed j finding Sopt requires time Tj =\na=1 O(|Fa |2 ) = O(\u01ebn2 ). Thus the\nPt\u22121\noverall running time of the PTAS is T = j=0 Tj = O(n26/\u01eb ). Choosing \u03b4 = 6\u01eb this implies\nthat the algorithm obtains an assignment with the energy at most (1 \u2212 \u03b4)H(Sopt ) in time\nO(n236/\u03b4 ).\n\n3\n\nQuantum Ising Spin Glass\n\nThe following theorem is the quantum equivalent of Theorem 1 and will be instrumental in\nproving our results:\nP\nTheorem 2 The minimum\neigenvalue \u03bb(H) of H for a planar graph \u03bb(H) \u2264 \u2212 u ||Lu ||/5\u2212\nP\nW/(5 * 35 ), where W = (u,v)\u2208E kQu,v k.\nProof: The strategy will be to upper bound \u03bb(H) by \u03bbsep (H), where \u03bbsep is the minimal\nenergy achieved on tensor products of states |0i, |1i, |+i, |\u2212i, | + ii, | \u2212 ii, where\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u00b1i = (|0i \u00b1 |1i)/ 2, | \u00b1 ii = (|0i \u00b1 i |1i)/ 2.\nIt is enough to prove that \u03bbsep is an extensive quantity and this can be achieved using the\nclassical result, Theorem 1. Let us first prove the Theorem for the special case then L = 0, that\nis H = Q involves only interactions quadratic in Pauli operators. For every edge (u, v) \u2208 E\nthe interaction Qu,v generally involves all 9 combinations of Pauli operators. We will choose\none of them that has the largest magnitude and call it a dominating coupling (ties are broken\narbitrarily). For example, if Qu,v = 3Xu \u2297 Yv \u2212 4Zu \u2297 Xv , then the edge (u, v) has dominating\ncoupling \u22124Zu \u2297 Xv . We have\n10\n\n\fLemma 3 Suppose Qu,v has a dominating coupling cuv Pu\u03b1 \u2297 Pv\u03b2 , where P \u03b1 , P \u03b2 \u2208 {X, Y, Z}.\nThen\n1\n(7)\n|cuv | \u2265 kQu,v k.\n9\nProof: Indeed, otherwise the triangle inequality would imply kQu,v k \u2264 9|cuv | < kQu,v k.\n\u2737\nWe shall now partition the edges E into several subsets E = \u222aj Ej , such that the dominating\ncouplings in each subset Ej commute with each other, that is, the sum of dominating couplings\nover Ej is equivalent to a classical Ising Hamiltonian up to a local change of basis. First of all,\nsince G is a planar graph we can color its vertices by {1, 2, 3, 4} such that adjacent vertices\nhave different colors. A map f : V \u2192 {X, Y, Z} that assigns a Pauli operator to every vertex\nof G will be called a Pauli frame if f (u) depends only on a color of u. Consider the following\nPauli frames.\n1 2 3 4\nX X X X\nX Y Z Y\nX Z Y Z\nY X Z Z\nY Y Y X\nY Z X Y\nZ X Y Y\nZ Y X Z\nZ Z Z X\nThis table forms an orthogonal array of strength two with alphabet {X, Y, Z}, that is every\npair of columns contains every possible combination of two Pauli operators exactly one time.\nLet f1 , . . . , f9 be the corresponding Pauli frames.

We can show that, similar as in the\nclassical case (see Claim 1), the following holds:\nLemma 4 One can choose a ground-state |\u03c80 i of Q such that h\u03c80 |L|\u03c80 i \u2264 0.\nProof: Consider an anti-unitary operator W (known as Kramers-Wannier duality) such that\nO\nW |\u03c6i =\nYu |\u03c6\u2217 i,\nu\u2208V\n\nwhere the complex conjugation is performed in |0i, |1i basis. One can check that Pu\u03b1 W =\n\u2212W Pu\u03b1 for any single-qubit Pauli operator Pu\u03b1 . It follows that\nLW = \u2212W L.\n\nQW = W Q,\n\nThus, if one defines a state |\u03c60 i = W |\u03c80 i, one gets\nh\u03c60 |L|\u03c60 i = \u2212h\u03c80 |L|\u03c80 i,\n\nh\u03c60 |Q|\u03c60 i = h\u03c80 |Q|\u03c80 i.\n\nIt follows that |\u03c60 i is also a ground state of Q and one of the expectations values h\u03c60 |L|\u03c60 i\nor h\u03c80 |L|\u03c80 i is non-positive.\n\u2737\nNow define 5 states \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c15 such that\n(i) For j = 1, . . . , 4 a state \u03c1j sets qubits u \u2208 V of color j to the ground state of Lu ; all other\nqubits are set to the maximally mixed state.\n(ii) \u03c15 is a ground state of Q such that Tr(\u03c15 L) \u2264 0.\nThen one has the following inequalities\nTr(Q \u03c1j ) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , 4, and Tr(Q \u03c15 ) = \u03bb(Q).\nX\nkLu k for j = 1, . . . , 4, and Tr(L \u03c15 ) \u2264 0.\nTr(L \u03c1j ) = \u2212\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nu : color(u)=j\n\nLet \u03c1 be the uniform probabilistic mixture of \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c15 .

Then, given any \u01eb > 0, there is a subset of edges\nE \u2032 with total weight at most \u01ebW such the removing these edges decomposes the graph G into\ncomponents each of which has weak diameter at most c/\u01eb with respect to G. Here c is fixed\nconstant independent of \u01eb.\nHere is the definition of a weak diameter:\nDefinition 1 Weak Diameter: Let G = (V, E) be a graph and let G\u2032 = (V \u2032 , E \u2032 ) be a\nsubgraph of G. We say that G\u2032 has weak diameter d with respect to G, if for any two vertices\nv, w \u2208 V \u2032 , their distance in G is at most d.\n12\n\n\fIf G is a planar graph with maximum degree d, Theorem 3 implies that each component can\nhave at most dO(1/\u01eb) vertices and hence the minimum eigenvalue problem for a Hamiltononian\nO(1/\u01eb)\nH restricted to every component can be solved in time 2d\n.\nThere is a linear time algorithm to determine the set of edges E \u2032 . The algorithm works as\nfollows: Let \u03b4 = \u01eb/3. Root the graph G at arbitrary vertex and consider the breadth first tree.\nA vertex is said to be at level i, if it is at distance i from the root. For j = 0, . . . , 1/\u03b4 \u2212 1, let\nEj denote the set of edges that connect two vertices at level i and i + 1 where i \u2261 j (modulo\n1/\u03b4). Choose the set Ej with least weight and remove these edges from G. Let G1 denote\nthe obtained graph. Now consider each of the components of G1 and apply this procedure\nagain to obtain the graph G2 . Finally, apply the same procedure to G2 to obtain G3 (one\napplies the procedure three times because planar graphs K3,3 minor free). The result of Klein,\nPlotkin and Rao [29] shows that G3 has weak diameter at most O(1/\u03b4) = O(1/\u01eb). Moreover\nthe weight ofP\nedges removed is\nPat most 3\u03b4 = \u01eb fraction of the total weight.\nLet H = (u,v)\u2208E Qu,v + u\u2208V Lu be a quantum Ising spin glass Hamiltonian defined on\na graph G = (V, E). Define a weight associated with an edge (u, v) as kQu,v k. Let Hsub be\na Hamiltonian obtained from H by keeping all the linear terms Lu and the quadratic terms\nQu,v associated with edges of a subgraph G3 defined above. By definition of G3 one has\nkH \u2212 Hsub k \u2264 \u01ebW and thus |\u03bb(Hsub ) \u2212 \u03bb(H)| \u2264 \u01ebW . Theorem 2 implies that |\u03bb(Hsub ) \u2212\n\u03bb(H)| \u2264 c\u01eb|\u03bb(H)| for some numeric constant c. Thus one can approximate \u03bb(H) with any\nO(1/\u01eb)\nfixed relative error \u01eb in time n2d\n.\n4\n\nQuantum Ising Spin Glass Problem on a Star Graph\n\nThe construction of PTAS for classical Hamiltonians on planar graphs presented in Section 2\nrelies on the fact that the classical problem on a tree (or any graph of constant treewidth) can\nbe solved efficiently using the dynamic programming. Unfortunately, this method does not\nwork for quantum Hamiltonians. In this section we develop a new technique that allows one\nto obtain a PTAS for the quantum Ising spin glass Hamiltonian on a star graph - a tree that\nconsists of n + 1 vertices with one vertex having degree n and n vertices having degree 1. The\ncorresponding graph is G = (V, E), where V = {0, 1, . . . , n} and E = {(0, 1), (0, 2), . . . , (0, n)}.\nWe shall refer to spins sitting at vertices 1, 2, . . . , n as bath spins and the spin sitting at the\nvertex 0 as central spin (by analogy with the central spin problem studied in condensed matter\nphysics [32]). Let the Hamiltonian be\nH = H0 +\n\nn\nX\n\nH0,j\n\n(14)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere H0 is a linear term acting on the central spin and H0,j is the interaction between the\ncentral spin and j-th bath spin (which can include both quadratic and linear terms).\nTheorem 3 Suppose there exist constants 0 < a \u2264 b such that a \u2264 kH0,j k \u2264 b for all\nj. Then one can approximate the smallest eigenvalue \u03bb(H) with a relative error \u01eb in time\n\u2212O(1)\nn\u01eb\n.\nIn the rest of this section we prove Theorem 3. We start from proving that \u03bb(H) can be\ncomputed exactly in time poly(n) as long as the number of distinct interactions H0,j is bounded\nby a constant. We shall use\nLemma 5 Suppose the interactions H0,j are the same for some subset of bath spins S \u2286\n{1, . . . , n}. Then one can choose a pure ground state of H symmetric under permutations of\nspins in S.\n\n13\n\n\fProof: Without loss of generality S = {1, 2, . . . , k}. Let |\u03a8i be a ground state of H.\nDenote Wj,k the swap of qubits j and k. Assume that |\u03a8i is not symmetric under permutations\nof spins in S. Without loss of generality, W1,2 |\u03a8i 6= |\u03a8i. There are two cases: (i) W1,2 |\u03a8i\nis proportional to |\u03a8i. Then W1,2 |\u03a8i = \u2212|\u03a8i, since W1,2 has eigenvalues \u00b11. Therefore\n|\u03a8i = |\u03a8\u2212 i12 \u2297 |\u03a8else i, where |\u03a8\u2212 i = \u221a12 (|01i \u2212 |10i) is the singlet state and |\u03a8else i is some\nstate of spins {0, 3, 4, . . . , n}. The second case is (ii) W1,2 |\u03a8i and |\u03a8i are linearly independent.\nThen the anti-symmetrized state |\u03a8\u2032 i = |\u03a8i \u2212 W12 |\u03a8i is non-zero. On the other hand, |\u03a8\u2032 i is\na ground state of H since W12 commutes with H. We conclude that |\u03a8\u2032 i = |\u03a8\u2212 i12 \u2297 |\u03a8else i.\nIn both case we conclude that H has a ground state |\u03a8i = |\u03a8\u2212 i12 \u2297 |\u03a8else i.\nSince the energy of a state depends only upon the reduced density matrices \u03c10,j , we can\nreplace the antisymmetric singlet |\u03a8\u2212 i by the symmetric EPR state |\u03a8+ i without changing\nthe energy. On the other hand, any state with energy equal to the ground-state energy must\nbe a ground state. We conclude that H has a ground-state |\u03a8i = |\u03a8+ i12 \u2297 |\u03a8else i.\nBy iterating the arguments above one concludes that H has a ground state\n+\n|\u03a8i = |\u03a8+\n12 i \u2297 * * * \u2297 |\u03a8k\u22121,k i \u2297 |\u03a8else i \u2261 |\u03a8S i \u2297 |\u03a8else i.\n\n(15)\n\nwhere |\u03a8else i is some state of all spins j \u2208\n/ S (if k is odd then there will be one unpaired spins\nin S; this will not change the arguments below very much). Now we can symmetrize |\u03a8i by\nbrute force method. Let\n1 X\n\u03a0=\nW (\u03c4 )\nk!\n\u03c4 \u2208Sk\n\nbe the projector onto the symmetric subspace, where W (\u03c4 ) is the unitary operator implementing a permutation \u03c4 of k spins in S. Note that the state |\u03a8S i in Eq. (15) has non-negative\namplitudes in the standard basis. Therefore W (\u03c4 ) |\u03a8S i also has non-negative amplitudes.\nTherefore \u03a0 |\u03a8S i 6= 0, and, accordingly, |\u03a8\u2032 i = \u03a0S \u2297 Ielse |\u03a8i is a non-zero state symmetric\nunder permutations of spins in S. On the other hand, since W (\u03c4 ) commutes with H, |\u03a8\u2032 i is\na ground state of H.\n\u2737\nThis result implies that we can look for a ground state that \"occupies\" only a |S| + 1\ndimensional subspace of the 2|S| dimensional Hilbert space describing spins in S. If we have\nM distinct interactions, the dimension of the space in which the optimization takes place is\nM\n\u03a0M\nwhich is polynomial in n. Thus the optimization problem for constant\ni+1 (|Si | + 1) \u2264 n\nM can be solved efficiently in n.\nIn order to map the general problem onto one in which we have constant number of distinct\ninteraction, we apply a coarse-graining procedure to the general Hamiltonian Eq. (14). One\ncan show\nLemma 6 For any 0 < a < 1 define a set Ma of 2-qubit Hamiltonians H satisfying a \u2264\nkHk \u2264 1. For any \u01eb > 0 there exist 2-qubit Hamiltonians G1 , . . . , GM , M = O((a\u01eb)\u221232 ) such\nthat min\u03b1 kG\u03b1 \u2212 Hk \u2264 \u01eb kHk for any H \u2208 Ma .\nProof: It is enough to satisfy min\u03b1 kG\u03b1 \u2212 Hk \u2264 \u01eba. A 2-qubit Hamiltonian satisfying\nkHk \u2264 1 lives in a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 * * *\u00d7 2 cube in R32 . Construct \u01eba-mesh, count the number of points.\n\u2737\nNow we are ready to prove Theorem 3. Without loss of generality, b = 1 (otherwise\nmultiply H by b\u22121 ). Applying Lemma 6 to every interaction H0,j one can partition the\nn bath spins into M = O((a\u01eb)\u221232 ) subsets S1 , . . . , SM such that kH0,j \u2212 G\u03b1 k \u2264 \u01eb kH0,j k\nPM P\nfor all j \u2208 S\u03b1 . We define a coarse-grained Hamiltonian H\u0303 = H0 + \u03b1=1 j\u2208S\u03b1 G\u03b1 [j].\n14\n\n\fHere\nPn the notation G\u03b1 [j] means that G\u03b1 acts on the spins 0 and j. We have kH \u2212 H\u0303k \u2264\n\u01eb j=1 kH0,j k \u2264 \u01eb5 *35 |\u03bb(H)| where the second inequality follows from Theorem 2. Therefore,\n|\u03bb(H) \u2212 \u03bb(H\u0303)| \u2264 c\u01eb|\u03bb(H)| for some numeric constant c. The classical PTAS will find the\nground-state (that is, a poly(n)-sized classical description of this state) and the ground-state\n\u2212O(1)\nenergy \u03bb(H\u0303) of the coarse-grained Hamiltonian. Lemma 5 implies that it requires time n\u01eb\n.\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nAn important open question is whether there exists a classical or quantum PTAS for the general quantum Ising spin glass problem on planar graphs. It is clear that some new techniques\nwill be needed to settle this problem. A simpler problem in this realm would the quantum\nIsing spin glass problem on a tree with unbounded degree. Note that even in the simplest\ncase of star graphs the existence of PTAS for the quantum problem is not proved (Theorem 3\nassumes the constant lower and upper bounds on the norm of interactions H0,j ).\nOne interesting approach to address these quantum problem may be to consider quantum\nor classical algorithms that output the thermal state e\u2212H/T /Z at temperature T for the Ising\nspin glass problem. Such thermal state will typically provide a PTAS for the ground-state\nenergy problem. One can prove this by showing that the average energy hHiT = TrHe\u2212H/T Z\nis bounded as |hHiT \u2212 \u03bb(H)| \u2264 2nT . This bound follows from the fact that for the free-energy\nF (T ) we have |F (T ) \u2212 hHiT | \u2264 nT and |F (T ) \u2212 \u03bb(H)| = |F (T ) \u2212 F (0)| \u2264 nT . When the\nground-state energy \u03bb(H) scales with n (e.g. for bounded weights |cuv | \u2264 c, ||Quv || \u2264 c one\ngets this from Theorems 1 and 2), the error in the approximation can be made \u01eb\u03bb(H) for T =\nO(\u01eb). This also shows that finite but small temperature implementation of adiabatic quantum\ncomputation will generally provide a PTAS-approximation to the ground-state energy problem\n(assuming that, say, for bounded-degree graphs beyond the planar ones, the ground-state\nenergy will be extensive, scales with n).\nThe difference between classical and quantum behavior on tree graphs is also witnessed by\nthe fact that the algorithm of classical belief propagation (for zero temperature this essentially\ncorresponds to dynamic programming) converges efficiently on trees, whereas quantum belief\npropagation will only work when additional conditions are fulfilled [30, 31]. It is expected\nthat for bounded-degree trees the quantum belief propagation algorithm of [31] at finite\ntemperature T will give rise to a PTAS.\nAcknowledgements\nSB and BMT acknowledge support by NSA and ARDA through ARO contract number\nW911NF-04-C-0098.\n1.
