Recent STAR results on the\nfirst measurement of W boson production in polarized p\n~+p\n~ collisions will be shown.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe spin structure and dynamics of the nucleon is one of the fundamental and unresolved\nquestions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Contrary to atomic physics where the total\nangular momentum of an atom can be accounted for by basic quantum theory in terms of its\nunderlying atomic constituents, a complete theoretical description of the proton spin decomposed\nin terms of contributions from quark and gluon angular momenta and spins is still missing.\nVarious experimental programs have been conducted in the past to deepen our understanding\non the proton spin. Deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments have clearly established that\nthe quark spin contribution is small and accounts\n\u221a for only \u2248 25% of the proton spin [1, 2].\nHigh energy polarized p~ + p~ collisions at s = 200 \u2212 500 GeV at RHIC provide a unique\nway to probe the proton spin structure and dynamics using hard scattering processes [3].\nThe production of jets and hadrons\n\u221a is the prime focus of the gluon polarization studies. The\n\u2212(+)\nproduction of W\nbosons at s = 500 GeV provides an ideal tool to study the spin-flavor\nstructure of the proton. This has been pointed out at the very early design stages of the polarized\nproton collider program at RHIC [4].\nThe first global analysis of polarized DIS data, as well as results obtained by the PHENIX\n[5] and STAR [6] experiments in polarized p~ + p~ collisions at RHIC placed a strong constraint\non the gluon spin contribution in the gluon momentum range of 0.05 < x < 0.2, and suggested\nthat the gluon spin contribution is not large in that range [7].

Recent STAR 2006 ALL inclusive jet result.\ndistribution function, \u2206g, through inclusive measurements has been, so far, the prime focus of\nthe STAR physics analysis program of the Run 3/4 [8], Run 5 [6] and Run 6 [9] data samples.\nInclusive measurements, such as inclusive jet production, integrate over a fairly large x region for\na given jet transverse momentum region. While those measurements provide a strong constraint\non the value of \u2206g integrated over a range in x, those measurements do not permit a direct\nsensitivity to the actual x dependence. This motivates the need for correlation measurements\nin polarized p~ + p~ collisions.\nThe STAR collaboration has presented a first measurement of the longitudinal spin transfer\n+\nDLL in inclusive \u039b (\u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 ) and\n\u221a \u039b\u0304 (\u039b\u0304 \u2192 p\u0304\u03c0 ) production in polarized proton-proton collisions\nat a center-of-mass energy of s = 200 GeV [10]. This measurement may provide constraints\non strange (anti) quark polarization [11] and can yield new insight into polarized fragmentation\nfunctions.\n\u221a\nThe first data taking period in 2009 of polarized p~ + p~ collisions at s = 500 GeV opens\na new era in the study of the spin-flavor structure of the proton based on the production of\n \u0304 collisions\nW \u2212(+) bosons. W \u2212(+) bosons are produced predominantly through \u016b + d (u + d)\nand can be detected through their leptonic decay. Quark and anti-quark helicity distribution\nfunctions are probed at large scales set by the mass of the W boson (Q \u223c mW ) where theoretical\ncalculations are well under control. The theoretical framework is well developed to describe the\nproduction of W bosons in high-energy polarized p~ + p~ collisions including the description of\nthe W decay leptons subject to experimental cuts, such as the transverse momentum pT and\npseudo-rapidity \u03b7 of the final-state leptons [12, 13]. This development profits from a rich history\nof hadroproduction of weak bosons at the CERN SPS and the FNAL Tevatron and provides a\nfirm basis to use W production as a new high-energy probe in polarized p~ + p~ collisions [14].\nThe STAR Collaboration has provided critical measurements on the sudy of transverse spin\neffects in polarized p+ p collisions at RHIC. An overview of these results is discussed in a\nseparate paper [15].\n\n\fALL\n\np+p $ #0 + X, s = 200 GeV, -.95 < \" < .95\n\n0.1\nGRSV standard\nGRSV ! g = 0\nGRSV ! g = -g\nGRSV ! g = g\nGS-C\n\n0.08\n0.06\n\n!0\n\n0.04\n\n(a)\n\n0.02\n-0\n-0.02\n\nSTAR run 6 preliminary\n\n-0.04\n-0.06\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nALL\n\nALL\n\npT [GeV/c]\n\n(b)\n\n0.08\n\n2006 STAR Preliminary\n\n2006 STAR Preliminary\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n0.2\n\n-\n\n-0.04\n\n!\n0.3\n\n-0.06\n-0.08\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nz = p (!)/p (jet)\nT\n\nT\n\n(c)\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.2\n\n+\n\n!\n0.3\n\nLO MC Evaluation\nGRSV-STD\nGS Set C\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nGRSV-ZERO\nDSSV\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nz = p (!)/p (jet)\nT\n\nT\n\nFigure 2.

The jet sample was required to be within a fiducial range of\nof R \u2261\n\u22120.7 < \u03b7Detector < 0.9 for the 2006 data sample with a cone radius of R = 0.7. The dominant\nfraction of jet events in the 2006 data sample are based on a jet patch (JP) trigger that required\na minimum energy deposition for a group of towers over a region of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 1.0 \u00d7 1.0. This\ntrigger was taken in coincidence with a minimum-bias condition using the STAR Beam-Beam\nCounter (BBC).\nThroughout the following discussion, four gluon polarization scenarios have been used as\ninput to NLO perturbative QCD calculations of ALL . The GRSV standard case refers to\na global analysis fit of polarized DIS data [16]. The case for a vanishing gluon polarization\n(GRSV-ZERO) and the case of a maximally positive (GRSV-MAX) or negative (GRSV-MIN)\ngluon polarization have also been considered. The GS-C [17] set of \u2206g is reflected by a large\npositive gluon polarization at low x, a node around x \u223c 0.1 and a negative gluon polarization\nat large x at a scale of Q2 \u223c 1 GeV2 .\nFigure 1 shows the most recent STAR preliminary result of ALL for inclusive jet production\nas a function of pT based on the 2006 data sample of 4.7 pb\u22121 . Typical beam polarization values\nduring the 2006 data-taking period were 55 \u2212 60%. The leading systematic uncertainty comes\nfrom the trigger and jet reconstruction biases. Differences between observed and true jet pT are\nestimated using PYTHIA and GEANT simulations and result in corrections being applied to the\njet pT values. Additionally, the trigger conditions at STAR can artificially bias the analyzed data\n\n\f3\n\n10\n\nCounts\n\nData\n\n2005 STAR\nPreliminary\n105\nd\u03c3 (pb/GeV/c2)\ndM\n\n3\n\n10\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\n1\n\n104\n\nSimulation\n2\n\n10\n\n2005 STAR Preliminary\n2005 STAR Data\n3\n\n10\n\nSystematic Uncertainties\nNLO Calculation (de Florian, et al.)\n\n103\n\n2\n\n10\n\nNLO with Hadronization and UE Corrections\n\n102\n10\n10\n\n10\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100 110\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nM=\n\n60\n\n\u221a\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100 110\n\nx1 x2 s\n\n0.5\n-0.2\n\n10-1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\np+p \u2192 Jet + Jet + X at\nR cone = 0.4\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\ns = 200 GeV\n\n1.5\n\n0.2 < \u03b7 < 0.8, |\u0394 \u03b7| < 0.5\n1.4\n|\u0394 \u03c6| > 2.0\n1.3\n10% Normalization Uncertainty\n(not included)\n1.2\n\n(data-theory)/theory\n\nRatio\n\nRatio\n\n1\n1.5\n\n0.6\n\nRatio\n\n20\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.7\n\n-0.5\n0\n\nScale Uncertainty on NLO, \u03bc = 2M, M/2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n20\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n30\n0.6\n\n0.8 40 1\n\nx1\n\u03b73 + \u03b74 = ln\nx2\n\n50\n\n0.560\n0\n\n70\n0.05\n\n\u2217\n\n0.1\n\n800.15 90\n100 0.3110\n0.2\n0.25\nInvariant Mass (GeV/c2)\n\ncos \u03b8 = tanh\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03b73 \u2212 \u03b74\n2\n\n\ufffd\n\nFigure 3.

Two primary sub-detectors, the STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter\n(BEMC) and respective Shower Maximum Detector (SMD) are employed to reconstruct decay\nphotons from mid rapidity neutral pions. Charged pion production is of particular interest\nsince the difference of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetries for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 production,\nALL (\u03c0 + ) - ALL (\u03c0 \u2212 ), tracks the sign of \u2206g, due to the opposite signs of the polarized distribution\nfunctions for up and down quarks. The STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC) offers robust\nreconstruction and identification of charged pions up to a transverse momentum of 15 GeV/c.\nParticle identification is accomplished using measurements of ionization energy loss in the TPC.\nFigure 2 (a) shows ALL for neutral pion production at mid rapidity as a function of pT\nbased on the 2006 data sample [18]. This new measurement is shown in comparison to NLO\ncalculations assuming different gluon polarization scenarios [9, 18]. This measurement reaches\nto higher pT values compared to previous measurements by PHENIX [19] and STAR [20]. At the\npresent level of precision, the data excludes extreme gluon polarization scenarios. The STAR\ncollaboration has recently presented also results for neutral pion production at forward rapidity\n\n\fSTAR preliminary - Run 6\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.

These measurements provide an important milestone for future photon-jet\ncoincidence measurements at STAR.\nFigure 2 (b) and (c) show STAR's new preliminary result of ALL for charged pion (\u03c0 \u2212 and\n+\n\u03c0 ) / jet correlation measurements at mid rapidity. Charged pions are reconstructed opposite\na jet that triggered the experiment. The data are shown versus z \u2261 pT (\u03c0)/pT (jet) and were\nobtained in 2006 [22]. Full NLO calculations for this observable have recently been released\n[23]. These calculations will provide the basis for charged pion results to be included in a global\nanalysis. The data shown for charged pion production are compared to a LO MC evaluation of\nALL excluding extreme scenarios of \u2206g. The measurement of ALL (\u03c0 + ) is of particular interest,\nsince its analyzing power is large because of the large ug scattering contribution to the production\ncross section and sizable \u2206u/u. In the future, more precise measurements of ALL (\u03c0 + ) have a\ngreat potential for providing a better understanding of \u2206g.\n4. Status and prospects of di-jet production\nCorrelation measurements such as those for di-jet production allow for a better constraint of\nthe partonic kinematics and thus the shape of \u2206g. At LO, the\ninvariant mass, M , is\n\u221a di-jet\n\u221a\nproportional to the product of the x values of the partons, M = s x1 x2 , whereas the pseudorapidity sum of the final-state jets, \u03b73 + \u03b74 , is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the\nx values, \u03b73 + \u03b74 = ln (x1 /x2 ). Photon-jet coincidence measurements are expected to provide\na theoretically clean way to extract \u2206g. A LO extraction of \u2206g alone would allow a modelindependent way to constrain the x dependence, which would be an important contribution,\nwithout making an a priori assumption on the\nof \u2206g as is currently required\n\u221a functional form \u221a\nin a global analysis. Measurements at both s = 200 GeV and s = 500 GeV are preferred to\nmaximize the kinematic reach in x and possibly provide a means to observe effects of scaling\nviolations at fixed x by measuring different pT values. The wide acceptance of the STAR\nexperiment permits reconstruction of di-jet events with different topological configurations,\n\n\f2009 STAR Data (\u221as=500GeV)\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nW candidate event\n\n(c)\n\nZ0 candidate event\n\nDi-Jet candidate event\n\n\u221a\nFigure 5.

This, together with the variation of the\ncenter-of-mass energy, is expected to constrain \u2206g over a wide range in x of approximately\n\u223c 2 * 10\u22123 < x < 0.3 for di-jet and photon-jet events. The NLO framework for correlation\nmeasurements exists and therefore those measurements can be used in a global analysis [24].\nFigure 3 shows a comparison of STAR 2005 di-jet data and a PYTHIA Monte-Carlo\nsimulation with the yield at the top and the ratio at the bottom for the invariant mass M , the\npseudo-rapidity sum \u03b73 + \u03b74 and the cosine of the partonic center-of-mass scattering angle cos \u03b8\u2217\ndetermined from the pseudo-rapidities of both final-state jets. The normalization between data\nand Monte-Carlo is fixed by the invariant mass distributions. The same normalization factor is\nthen applied to both other di-jet distributions. Data and Monte-Carlo are found to be in good\nagreement.\nFigure 4 (a) shows the statistical precision of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, ALL ,\nas a function of the di-jet invariant mass, M . Those uncertainties, extracted from the 2006 data\nsample, are compared to a LO MC evaluation of ALL computed with a PYTHIA MC sample\nusing different event weights to account for different polarized gluon distribution functions of\nGRSV [16] and DSSV [7]. The size of the statistical uncertainty at the highest invariant mass\nbin is at the level of the difference between GRSV-STD and DSSV.\nFigure 4 (b) shows the expected precision\n\u221a for the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, ALL ,\nfor di-jet production as a function of M/ s for different topological combinations of the STAR\nBEMC and the STAR Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) acceptance regions.

In contrast, a kinematic region of\nlarger x values is probed at predominantly symmetric partonic collisions such as the one shown\nin the lower right panel. The effective variation of x1 and x2 is roughly equal and given by the\nhorizontal axis of the lower right panel.

Asymmetric cuts are imposed for the LO MC and the NLO determination of\nmin(pT ) \u2265 7 GeV/c and max(pT ) \u2265 10 GeV/c. The result of a LO MC evaluation using GS-C\n[17] for \u2206g is also shown. GS-C is still consistent with the current inclusive jet results [9]. A\ncone radius of R = 0.7 has been used. Good agreement is found between a LO MC evaluation\nof ALL and a full NLO calculation. Scale uncertainties are found to be small in comparison to\nthe variation of the chosen polarized gluon distribution functions, in particular, at large values\nof M .\nWhile inclusive measurements from STAR have provided important constraints on \u2206g, and\nwill continue to do so, the impact of correlation measurements to the x dependence should\ngreatly enhance our understanding of \u2206g.\n5.

Only their tower response\nhas been taken into account in this analysis. The BEMC was used to measure the transverse\nenergy, ET , of e\u00b1 . The suppression of the QCD background by several orders of magnitude was\nbased on the TPC, BEMC and EEMC. Figure 5 shows event displays from the 2009 data taking\nperiod for a W candidate event (a), a Z 0 candidate event and a di-jet candidate event (c). A\nlego plot is shown in Figure 6 displaying the BEMC ET and the TPC pT distribution for a W\ncandidate event at the top and a di-jet candidate event at the bottom.\n\u221a\nProton-proton collision events focusing on W production at s = 500 were identified by a\ntwo-step energy requirement in the BEMC. Electrons and positrons from W production at mid\nrapidity are characterized by large ET peaked at \u223c MW /2 (Jacobian peak). At the hardware\ntrigger level (L0), a high tower (HT) calorimetric trigger condition required ET > 7.3 GeV\nin a single BEMC tower. At the software trigger level (L2), a dedicated trigger algorithm\nwas developed that required that a 2 \u00d7 2 tower cluster ET sum exceeds 13 GeV. The offline\nselection of W candidate events is based on kinematical and topological difference between\nleptonic W \u00b1 decays, and QCD background events as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Events\nfrom W \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bd decays contain a nearly isolated e\u00b1 with a neutrino in the opposite direction\nin azimuth. The neutrino escapes detection, leading to a large missing energy.\nFigure 7 illustrates the basic idea of the selection of W candidate events.

The TPC high-pT entry appears in the\nsame \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 region as the large BEMC ET entry. Both BEMC SMD layers show a large energy\ndeposition at the same location in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 plane as the TPC high-pT and the BEMC highET entry. An electron candidate is defined to be any TPC track with pT > 10 GeV/c that is\nassociated with a primary vertex with |z| < 100 cm, where z is the distance along the beam\ndirection. A 2 \u00d7 2 BEMC tower cluster ET sum is required to be larger than 15 GeV. The excess\nBEMC ET sum in a 4 \u00d7 4 tower cluster centered around the respective 2 \u00d7 2 tower cluster is\nrequired to be below 5%. In addition, the distance between the 2 \u00d7 2 cluster tower centroid\nand the TPC track is required to be less than 7 cm. A near-cone is formed around the electron\ncandidate direction with a radius in \u03b7-\u03c6 space of R = 0.7. The excess BEMC and TPC ET sum\nis required to be less than 12% of the 2 \u00d7 2 cluster ET . The away side requirement is based\non a cut on the BEMC and TPC ET sum to be less than 8 GeV. This sum is extended over\nthe full \u03b7 range of the BEMC and EEMC and \u2206\u03c6 = 0.7 as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows\nthe evolution of all cuts for the BEMC 2 \u00d7 2 ET distribution. A clear Jacobian peak emerges\ncharacteristic for W production in contrast to QCD background dominating the low ET region.\nA data-driven procedure was applied to estimate the level of QCD background events.\nThe first part consists of an estimate of the impact of the missing calorimeter coverage for\n\u22122 < \u03b7 < \u22121 on the cluster ET distribution. This estimate was obtained by performing a\nparallel analysis without the EEMC as an active detector. The difference in yield of accepted\nevents as a function of ET provides an absolute estimate for the missing calorimetric coverage.\nThe remaining background is estimated by fitting a separate QCD shape distribution in ET to the\nregion of ET < 19 GeV shown as the black histogram in Figure 9. The fitted QCD background\ndistribution is shown by the blue histogram in Figure 9. The background subtracted distribution\nis shown by the yellow histogram. Figure 9 also shows the distribution from a PYTHIA MonteCarlo simulation.
