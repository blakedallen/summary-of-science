Similar limits have been noticed before for specific forms\nof the distribution function, but here we establish this as a general result.\nSubject headings: stellar dynamics - methods: analytical - galaxies: kinematics and dynamics\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nNumerical simulations of halo formation provide strong evidence that the inner parts of dark matter halos are strongly\ncusped. Typically, the density profile \u03c1 behaves like r\u2212\u03b3 ,\nwhere \u03b3 lies between 1 and 1.5 (Navarro, Frenk, & White\n1995; Moore et al. 1998). Although this numerical result\nseems well established, observational evidence that dark halos are cusped has been surprisingly elusive. A disparate\nbody of data \u2013 including the rotation curves of dwarf spiral galaxies (Palunas & Williams 2000; de Blok et al. 2001),\nthe kinematics of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(Kleyna et al. 2003), and mass models of gravitational lens\nsystems (Tyson, Kochanski, & dell'Antonio 1998) \u2013 seem to\nfavor constant-density cores.\nRecently, Hansen (2004) claimed that the only density\nslopes permitted by the spherically symmetric and isotropic\nJeans equations are 1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 3 if the phase-space density-like\nquantity, \u03c1/hv2 i3/2 , follows a power law (Taylor & Navarro\n2001). This result was inferred from the condition that\nthe power-law solution of the Jeans and Poisson equations\nis physical, subject to the \"equation of state\" (EOS), \u03c1 \u221d\nc\nr\u2212p hv2r i , where p and c are constants. He further argued\nthat, for the system with an anisotropic velocity dispersion\ntensor, 1 + \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 3. Here the anisotropy parameter is\n\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 hv2T i/(2hv2r i), where hv2r i and hv2T i are the radial and\nthe tangential velocity second moments (Binney & Tremaine\n1987). Given the nearly isotropic conditions found in the central parts of simulated dark halos, this already seems to indicate that the density profile cannot be shallower than \u03c1 \u223c r\u22121 .\nThe idea of looking for constraints between the central density slope and the anisotropy is an excellent one. In \u00a7 2,\nwe show that the inequality \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 is a necessary condition for the nonnegativity of the distribution function (DF).\nThis generalizes two well-established results: (1) a spherical\nsystem with a hole in the center cannot be supported by an\nisotropic velocity dispersion tensor (i.e., \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 = 0; see\nTremaine et al. 1994), and (2) a spherical system with particles in purely radial orbits cannot be supported by a density\n1\n\nInstitute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, Madingley Road,\nCambridge, CB3 0HA, UK\n2 MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics & Space Research, Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139\n\ncusp shallower than the isothermal cusp (i.e., \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 = 2; see\nRichstone & Tremaine 1984). In \u00a7 3, we study the scale-free\npower-law cusps that inspired Hansen (2004) and show that\nthe inequality \u03b3 \u2265 1 + \u03b2 is related to the boundary condition at\ninfinity rather than at the center. Finally, in \u00a7 4, we consider\nthe generalization of the theorem to tracer populations in an\nexternally imposed cusped potential \u2013 for example, to stars\nmoving around a central black hole. In particular, with the\npotential cusped as r\u2212\u03b4 (0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1), we find that the inequality becomes \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 + ( 12 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b4. While a similar limit has been\nnoted in the literature for the case in which the DF is scale-free\n(White 1981; de Bruijne, van der Marel, & de Zeeuw 1996),\nwe derive the limit as a general condition for a DF with a centrally diverging (and not necessarily self-consistent) potential.\n2. PROOF OF A CUSP SLOPE-ANISOTROPY THEOREM\n\nHere we shall prove that if the density is cusped like r\u2212\u03b3\nnear the center, then the limiting value of \u03b2 at the center may\nnot be greater than \u03b3/2. This relation is indeed suggested by\nsolving the Jeans equation for constant \u03b2. That is, the onedimensional radial velocity dispersion obtained as the solution, in general, diverges at the center if \u03b3 < 2\u03b2, which is unphysical unless the central potential well depth is infinite. In\nfact, we will show that the inequality \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 is the necessary\ncondition for the nonnegativity of the DF.\n2.1. Constant Anisotropy Distribution Functions\nFirst, let us suppose that the DF is given by the Ansatz3\nf (E, L) = L\u22122\u03b2 fE (E),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L is the specific angular momentum, and fE (E) is a\nfunction of the binding energy E alone. This seems as though\nit is a restrictive assumption, but this is not really the case.\nRather, equation (1) arises naturally as the most divergent\nterm in a Laurent series expansion with respect to L at L = 0\nfor a very wide class of DFs. By integrating equation (1) over\n3 Strictly speaking, the Ansatz is valid only for \u03b2 < 1. However, it can be\nextended to \u03b2 = 1 using the relation lim\u03b2\u21921 [L2\u03b2 /\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2)] = \u03b4(L2 ), where\n\u03b4(x) is the Dirac delta \"function.\" Subsequently, equations (2)\u2013(5) are still\nvalid for f (E, L) = \u03b4(L2 ) fE (E) as the \u03b2 = 1 limit simply without the \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\nfactor.\n\n\f2\n\nAN & EVANS\n\nvelocity space, we find that the density is given by\nZ \u03c8\n\u22122\u03b2\n\u03c1 = r D\u03b2\n(\u03c8 \u2212 E)1/2\u2212\u03b2 fE (E) dE,\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nD\u03b2 =\n\n(2\u03c0)3/2 \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n,\n2\u03b2 \u0393(3/2 \u2212 \u03b2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the relative potential and \u0393(x) is the gamma function. The unknown function fE (E) can be found from the formula (Cuddeford 1991; Kochanek 1996; Wilkinson & Evans\n1999; An & Evans 2006; Evans & An 2006)\n\"Z E\n#\n1 dn h\nd\u03c8 dn+1 h\n+ \u03b1\nfE (E) = C\u03b2\n(4)\n\u03b1\nn+1\nE d\u03c8n \u03c8=0\n0 (E \u2212 \u03c8) d\u03c8\nC\u03b2 =\n\n(2\u03c0)3/2\u0393(1\n\n2\u03b2\n.\n\u2212 \u03b1)\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n\n(5)\n\nHere h = r2\u03b2 \u03c1 is expressed as a function of \u03c8, and n = \u230a 32 \u2212 \u03b2\u230b\nand \u03b1 = 32 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 n are the integer floor and the fractional part\nof 32 \u2212 \u03b2. It is a simple exercise to show that the anisotropy\nparameter for this model is the same as the parameter \u03b2 in the\nexpression of DF (eq. 1).\nBy considering the limit of equation (2) as r \u2192 0 one can\ninfer that \u03c1 should diverge at least as fast as r\u22122\u03b2 if \u03b2 > 0\nand cannot approach zero faster than r2(\u2212\u03b2) if \u03b2 < 0 unless\nthe integral vanishes in the same limit. This in fact is the\nbasic argument that leads to the theorem. In the following, we\nprovide a more stringent proof of the theorem.\n2.1.1.

General (Analytic) Distribution Functions\nThis result is in fact far more general than the assumed\nAnsatz for the DF (eq. 1). For example, Ciotti & Pellegrini\n(1992) found the same limit (\u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 = 0) for the Osipkov\n(1979a,b)-Merritt (1985) type DF, which is manifestly not in\nthe form of equation (1). We extend the limit derived in the\npreceding section to a wide class of DFs by the following simple argument. In general, any analytic DF can be expressed\neither as sums of equation (1) or in terms of a Laurent series\nexpansion with respect to L at L = 0 (really a special class of\nthe former). Then since L = rvT , as r \u2192 0, the DF is dominated by the term associated with the leading order of L, and\nconsequently so is the behavior of the density near the center.\nIt is also straightforward to show that the anisotropy parameter at the center is indeed determined by \u03b20 , where '\u22122\u03b20 ' is\nthe power to the leading term of L. The desired result therefore follows from the preceding proof for the special case of\nthe DF with a single term. In Appendix, we discuss the conditions of applicability of the proof more mathematically and\nargue that the theorem holds for all physically reasonable DFs\nof spherical systems.\nWe find that the cusp slope\u2013anisotropy theorem (\u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2) is\nactually quite reasonable. It implies that, if the anisotropy is\n\n\fCUSP SLOPE\u2013CENTRAL ANISOTROPY THEOREM\nradially biased (\u03b2 > 0) near the center, the density is cusped,\nand that, unless the cusp slope is steeper than that of isothermal cusp (\u03b3 = 2), there is a finite upper limit to \u03b2 that is\nstrictly smaller than unity. Similarly, if the density is cored\n(\u03b3 = 0), the central anisotropy is either tangentially biased or\nat most isotropic.\n3. SCALE-FREE DENSITY PROFILE\n\nRecently, Hansen (2004) derived a similar but stricter inequality \u03b3 \u2265 1 + \u03b2, based on the condition that there exists\na physical power-law solution to the spherically symmetric\nJeans and Poisson equations with the EOS, \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212p hv2r ic .\nSince \u03b2 \u2264 1, his result is stronger than our result. However,\nwe note that his result is strictly valid only if both \u03c1 and hv2r i\nbehave as the pure power law extending globally to the infinity. In fact, we find that the condition \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2+1 originates from\nthe boundary condition at infinity rather than at the center and\nthus argue that the result should be understood to refer to the\nasymptotic density power index at infinity, not the central density slope. In particular, the supposed piece of evidence cited\nby Hansen (2004) for his inequality (\u0141okas & Hoffman 2000;\nsee also Bouvier & Janin 1968) is in fact due to the constraint\nimposed by \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 on the central slope through the positivity\nof the DF (\u00a7 2; see also Richstone & Tremaine 1984), since\nit involves the case of purely radial motion (\u03b2 = 1) for which\nthe two limits coincide (\u03b3 \u2265 2).\nThe general integral solution of the Jeans equation with\nconstant \u03b2 can be written by admitting an integration constant\nB\u0303,\nZ r\nd\u03c8\ndr\u2032 r\u20322\u03b2 \u03c1(r\u2032 )\nr2\u03b2 \u03c1hv2r i = B\u0303 +\n.\n(21)\ndr r=r\u2032\nr0\nThe potential gradient (i.e., the local gravitational acceleration) can be found from the enclosed mass\nZ r\nGMr\nd\u03c8\n=\u2212 2 ;\nMr = Mr0 + 4\u03c0\n\u03c1(r\u2032 )r\u20322 dr\u2032 , (22)\ndr\nr\nr0\nwhere the negative sign is due to our choice of sign for \u03c8.\nIf we assume a strict power-law behavior for the density as\n\u03c1 = Ar\u2212\u03b3 , where A > 0 is constant, then Mr is given by (\u03b3 , 3)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3\u2212\u03b3\nMr = Mr0 + 4\u03c0A(3 \u2212 \u03b3)\u22121 r3\u2212\u03b3 \u2212 r0 .\n(23)\n\nIf the power law extends to the center, the result must be valid\nfor the choice of r0 = 0. However, then the mass within any\nfinite radius Mr always diverges for \u03b3 \u2265 3 even if M0 is finite,\nand therefore the model is unphysical. The resulting upper\nlimit \u03b3 < 3 is well established. By substituting equation (22)\nand \u03c1 = Ar\u2212\u03b3 in equation (21), hv2r i as a function of r (\u03b3 , 3,\n\u03b3 , \u03b2 + 1, and \u03b3 , 2\u03b2 \u2212 1) is found to be\n2\u03c0GA\nhv2r i = Br\u03b3\u22122\u03b2 \u2212 r2\u2212\u03b3\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 + 1)\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n4\u03c0GAr03\u2212\u03b3\nGMr0 \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n1 \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\uf8fa ,\n+ \uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212\n(24)\nr (3 \u2212 \u03b3)(2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 1) 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 1 \uf8fb\n\nwhere B is an integration constant to be determined from the\nboundary condition. Here if we assume strictly scale-free behavior for \u03c1, equation (24) is valid everywhere extending from\nr = 0 to r = \u221e. With r0 = 0 and M0 = 0, we can show that the\ncondition for hv2r i to be nonnegative everywhere leads to the\ninequality \u03b3 > \u03b2+1, as found by Hansen (2004), and B \u2265 0. In\naddition, the self-similarity implies strict power-law behavior\nfor hv2r i as well. Since A > 0, this can only be obtained with\nthe choice of B = 0. In fact, the choice of B = 0 can independently be deduced from the boundary condition at infinity.\n\n3\n\nThat is, hv2r i is nondivergent for a finite potential (\u03b3 < 2), or if\nthe potential diverges (\u03b3 > 2), the velocity dispersion cannot\ndiverge faster than the potential does.\nHowever, if we relax the assumption that \u03c1 is strictly scalefree everywhere and replace it with \u03c1 being locally well approximated by the power law near the center, equation (24)\nis valid only for the region where \u03c1 \u2248 Ar\u2212\u03b3 , so the condition that hv2r i is nonnegative only needs to be checked for this\nregime. Provided that the power law provides a good approximation to the behavior of \u03c1 near the center and that we limit\nour attention to a self-consistent density-potential system, it\nis reasonable to choose r0 = 0 and M0 = 0. Then for \u03b3 > 2\u03b2,\nwith any positive constant B, equation (24) returns the correct\nbehavior of the velocity dispersion near the center, although\nits validity does not extend to infinity. For \u03b3 > \u03b2 + 1, the\nvelocity dispersion (r0 = M0 = 0) is given by\n#\n\"\n2\u03c0GA\n2(\u03b3\u2212\u03b2\u22121)\n2\n2\u2212\u03b3\n.\n(25)\n+ Br\nhvr i = r\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 1)\nNear the center, we find that hv2r i \u223c A\u2032 r2\u2212\u03b3 , where A\u2032 is a\npositive constant. This is just the approximate local powerlaw behavior of the velocity dispersion near the center (valid\nlocally for any B). In addition, if \u03b2 + 1 < \u03b3 \u2264 2, the central velocity dispersion is finite. Although hv2r i diverges at the\ncenter if \u03b3 > 2 \u2265 \u03b2 + 1, this behavior can be physical because the self-consistent potential well depth for this case is\nalso infinite. On the other hand, if \u03b3 < \u03b2+1, the same velocity\ndispersion can be written as\n#\n\"\n2\u03c0GA\n.\n(26)\nhv2r i = r\u03b3\u22122\u03b2 B \u2212 r2(\u03b2+1\u2212\u03b3)\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3)(\u03b2 + 1 \u2212 \u03b3)\nIn other words, since \u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b2 < 2 \u2212 \u03b3 if \u03b3 < \u03b2 + 1, the leading term for the velocity dispersion near the center is given\nby hv2r i \u223c Br\u03b3\u22122\u03b2 provided that B , 0. While not strictly\nscale-free, the local behavior of the velocity dispersion near\nthe center can still be approximated as a power law, and furthermore, as long as B > 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b2 < 2 \u2212 \u03b3, it is\npositive and finite. While we note that for a sufficiently large\nr, equation (26) eventually becomes negative, since the r2\u2212\u03b3\nterm becomes dominant as r \u2192 \u221e, this does not restrict the\ncentral power index for density, provided that the behavior of\n\u03c1 starts to deviate from \u223c Ar\u2212\u03b3 (toward the steeper falloff) at\nsmaller r than the value at which hv2r i = 0 in equation (26).\nLet us consider the explicit example of the Hernquist (1990)\nmodel, which has a r\u22121 density cusp (i.e., \u03b3 = 1). The radial velocity dispersion of the constant-\u03b2 model is (see, e.g.,\nBaes & Dejonghe 2002; Evans & An 2005)\n\u0012\nr\na \u0013\nGM\n,\n(27)\n1,\n5;\n6\n\u2212\n2\u03b2;\nhv2r i =\nF\n2\n1\n(5 \u2212 2\u03b2) (r + a)2\nr+a\nwhere the potential is given by \u03c8 = GM/(r + a). It is straightforward to show that, for 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 21 , hv2r i is everywhere positive finite with its leading order behavior near the center given\nby \u223c r1\u22122\u03b2 (if \u03b2 = 21 , then hv2r i = \u03c8/4; see also Evans & An\n2005). On the other hand, if \u03b2 < 0, the leading order for hv2r i\nnear the center is found to be \u223c r with a positive coefficient.\nFor the isotropic case (\u03b2 = 0), the elementary functional expression for the velocity dispersion is given in equation (10)\nof Hernquist (1990), whose leading order behavior is found to\nbe \u223c r ln r\u22121 (see, e.g., eq. 11 of Hernquist 1990).\nAs another example, we consider the dark matter profile\nproposed by Dehnen & McLaughlin (2005). They solved the\nspherically symmetric Jeans and Poisson equations with the\nsame EOS as in Hansen (2004). However, they found a family\n\n\f4\n\nAN & EVANS\n\nof \"realistic\" models with a finite mass and an infinite extent.\nWith \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212p hv2r i3/2 , the inner density cusp of their models\nis given by \u03b3 = (7 + 10\u03b20 )/9, where \u03b20 is the anisotropy parameter at the center. It is clear that for all members of these\nmodels \u03b3 < \u03b20 + 1, since \u03b20 \u2264 1 < 2, thus violating the inequality \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 + 1. On the other hand, our result \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2\nindicates that they are physical if and only if \u03b20 \u2264 78 . In fact,\nhv2r i near the center for this family behaves as \u223c r(7\u22128\u03b20 )/9 , and\nthus the limit \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 is equivalent to the condition that the\ncentral velocity dispersion is finite.\nA similar analysis of equation (24) can be applied to discover the asymptotic behavior of the velocity dispersion at\ninfinity. Suppose that \u03c1 asymptotically approaches a power\nlaw for a sufficiently large r. Then for the same range, equation (24) is a valid expression for hv2r i, provided that the power\nlaw \u223c A\u03c1\u2212\u03b3 describes the asymptotic behavior of \u03c1 and Mr0 is\nthe mass within r0 . Here B = 0 from the boundary condition\nat infinity. If the total mass is finite (\u03b3 > 3 > \u03b2 + 1 > 2\u03b2 \u2212 1),\nwe can simply set r0 = \u221e and M\u221e = M, where M is the total\nmass. Then since \u22121 > 2 \u2212 \u03b3, the asymptotic behavior of the\nvelocity dispersion is given by hv2r i \u223c (\u03b3 + 1 \u2212 2\u03b2)\u22121GM/r,\nwhich is consistent with Keplerian falloff. For an infinitemass system, we find that 2 \u2212 \u03b3 > \u22121, and thus the leading\nterm of hv2r i for r \u2192 \u221e is \u223c A\u2032 r2\u2212\u03b3 . Here A\u2032 is a positive constant if \u03b3 > \u03b2+1, whereas it is a negative constant if \u03b3 < \u03b2+1.\nIn other words, from the condition of nonnegativity of the velocity dispersion toward infinity, we actually recover the inequality of Hansen (2004), \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 + 1, although here \u03b3 and \u03b2\nare the asymptotic density power index and the anisotropy parameter at infinity. Although the velocity dispersion diverges\nas r \u2192 \u221e if \u03b3 < 2, the behavior may be acceptable because\nthe potential also diverges with the same power index, so the\nsystem is still bounded.\n4. CENTRAL BLACK HOLE\n\nWe have found one further example of a cusp slope\u2013\nanisotropy relationship in the literature. White (1981) found\na relation4 by studying the special case of scale-free densities\nin scale-free potentials, namely\n\u03b4\n+ \u03b2(2 \u2212 \u03b4),\n(28)\n2\nwhere \u03b4 is the central power-law index for the potential (i.e.,\n\u03c8 \u223c r\u2212\u03b4 ), which may be externally imposed. Note the change\nof the notation from White (1981). The form of the limit given\nin equation (28) is actually that of de Bruijne et al. (1996),\nwho performed a similar study to White (1981) but allowed\nfor flattening. This result was derived from a specific functional form for the DF, and in particular assumed that fE (E) is\nscale-free. We note that, since \u03b2 \u2264 1, the inequality \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 is\nautomatically satisfied if \u03b3 \u2265 2. For \u03b3 < 2, the self-consistent\npotential-density has a finite central potential, so \u03b4 = 0. In\nthis case, equation (28) reduces to \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2. However, in the\npresence of a central black hole (\u03b4 = 1), equation (28) provides us with a different limit \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 + 12 , which is stricter than\n\u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 if \u03b2 < 21 .\nHere we note that this limit can, without assuming that the\ndensity or DF is scale-free, be derived from the nonnegativity\nof the DF for a massless tracer population in the Keplerian potential of a central point mass. Let us suppose that the DF for\n\u03b3\u2265\n\n4 The inequality given in White (1981) or de Bruijne et al. (1996) did not\ninclude the case of equality because of the specific form of the scale-free DF.\nThe general result actually extends to include the case of equality through the\ntransition of the power-law distribution to the Dirac delta distribution.\n\na massless tracer population is given by equation (1). (The\nresults can then be extended to more general DFs using the\nidentical argument of \u00a7 2.2.) Next, we assume that these tracers are subject to the potential \u03c8 = GM/r of a point mass at\nthe center. Then the number density of the tracer population\nn can be found from integration of the DF over velocity space\nas in equation (2);\nZ\n\u00131/2\u2212\u03b2\nD\u03b2 GM/r \u0012 GM\n\u2212E\nfE (E) dE\nn = 2\u03b2\nr\nr\n0\nZ GM/r\nD\u03b2\n= \u03b2+1/2\n(GM \u2212 rE)1/2\u2212\u03b2 fE (E) dE.\n(29)\nr\n0\nFor \u03b2 < 12 , we find that\nd \u0010 \u03b2+1/2 \u0011\nr\nn = \u2212D\u0303\u03b2\ndr\n\nZ\n\nGM/r\n\n0\n\nE fE (E) dE\n\u22640\n(GM \u2212 rE)1/2+\u03b2\n\nfor any nonnegative DF.

In fact, if the external potential\nis replaced by \u03c8 = C/r\u03b4 in equation (29), it is easy to see\nthat equation (28) simply follows from an essentially identical\nargument with \u03b3 = \u2212(d ln n/d ln r) being the central power\nindex for the number density of the tracer population.\nIn fact, the result can still be obtained without assuming the\nspecific form of (scale-free) potential. That is, provided only\nthat \u03b4 = \u2212 limr\u21920 (d ln \u03c8/d ln r) and 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1, we find from\nequation (2) that\n!1/2\u2212\u03b2\nZ\nE\n\u03c81/2\u2212\u03b2 \u03c8\nfE (E)dE,\n(33)\n1\u2212\nn = D\u03b2 2\u03b2\n\u03c8\nr\n0\n\u2212\n\nand thus for \u03b2 < 21 , we have\nZ \u03c8\nE fE (E) dE\nd \u0010 2\u03b2 \u03b2\u22121/2 \u0011\n= D\u0303\u03b2\nnr \u03c8\n\u2265 0.\n2\n1/2+\u03b2\nd\u03c8\n0 \u03c8 [1 \u2212 (E/\u03c8)]\n\n(34)\n\nHowever, of course,\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd \u0010 2\u03b2 \u03b2\u22121/2 \u0011 nr2\u03b2\u22121 \u03c8\u03b2\u22121/2 d\n=\nnr \u03c8\nln nr2\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b2\u22121/2\nd\u03c8\nd\u03c8/dr d ln r\n\"\n!\n#\n2\u03b2 \u03b2\u22123/2\nd ln n\n1 d ln \u03c8\nnr \u03c8\n\u2265 0, (35)\n+ 2\u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2212\n=\nd ln \u03c8/d ln r d ln r\n2 d ln r\nand by taking the limit r \u2192 0,\n\u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 +\n\n!\n1\n\u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4.\n2\n\n(36)\n\nHere note that limr\u21920 (d ln \u03c8/d ln r) = \u2212\u03b4 \u2264 0. This also indicates that the result is still valid even if the self-gravity of the\ntracer population is appreciable, as long as the potential (that\nmay be decoupled from the density) is divergent at the center.\nIf \u03b2 = 21 , the limit given in equation (28) is, in fact, identical\nto \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 = 1. Since the derivation of the limit in \u00a7 2 for \u03b2 =\n1\n2 does not use the assumption of self-consistency, it is still\napplicable here. Therefore, the limits in equations (32) and\n(36) can be extended to \u03b2 \u2264 21 . For 12 < \u03b2 \u2264 1, the limit \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2\nis actually stronger than equation (28) (note that 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1).\n\n\fCUSP SLOPE\u2013CENTRAL ANISOTROPY THEOREM\nHowever, with a centrally diverging potential (i.e., \u03c80 = \u221e),\nthe proof given in \u00a7 2.1.2 is not directly applicable. Instead,\nfrom equation (13), we now find that limr\u21920 k, where k =\nnr2\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b2\u22121/2 either is finite and nonzero or diverges to positive\ninfinity. Following exactly the same argument as in \u00a7 2.1.2\napplied to k = nr2\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b2\u22121/2 instead of h = \u03c1r2\u03b2 , we have\n!\nd ln k\nd ln n\n1\nd ln \u03c8\nlim\n= lim\n+ 2\u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2212\n\u2264 0, (37)\nlim\nr\u21920 d ln r\nr\u21920 d ln r\n2 r\u21920 d ln r\nwhich translates to equation (36), and thus we can extend the\nlimit of equation (36) to \u03b2 > 12 as well.\nThe limit \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 + 12 for \u03b4 = 1 indicates that a spherical\nisotropic system subject to a Keplerian potential should possess a central density cusp at least as steep as r\u22121/2 . Similarly,\nif an isotropic stellar system is subject to a divergent dark matter potential due to a cusped profile with a slope steeper than\nthat of the isothermal cusp, the stellar system should also be\ncusped with its cusp slope constrained to be \u03b3\u22c6 \u2265 (\u03b3DM /2)\u22121,\nwhere \u03b3\u22c6 is the cusp index for the stellar system and \u03b3DM \u2265 2\nis that of the dark matter profile. Of course, if \u03b3DM < 2, the\ncentral potential is finite provided that there is no other source\nof divergent potential, and thus the limit simply reduces to\n\u03b3\u22c6 \u2265 0. On the other hand, if the system were mildly radially\nanisotropic (near the center), that is to say \u03b2 \u2248 21 , the limit for\nthe supportable cusp slope would be steeper, much like \u03b3 & 1.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have proved, for a very wide class of steady-state gravitating system, a theorem constraining the central cusp slope\n\n5\n\nof the density profile \u03b3 (eq. 20) and the central velocity\nanisotropy \u03b2. Specifically, the inequality \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 is a necessary condition for the nonnegativity of the distribution function (DF). If there is a divergent external potential, decoupled from the density profile, then the inequality generalizes\nto \u03b3 \u2265 2\u03b2 \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 12 )\u03b4. Here the external potential diverges as\n\u223c r\u2212\u03b4 at the center. Finally, if the external potential is due to\na central black hole, it reduces to \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 + 21 . We expect our\nresult to be useful in the study of dense stellar systems, or in\nthe building of extreme stellar dynamical models.\nAs most N-body simulations predict only very modest\nanisotropies (\u03b2 \u2248 0) in the very center, the application of\nour result does not directly constrain the central density profile (\u03b3 & 0). While the inequality derived by Hansen (2004),\nnamely, 1 + \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b3 < 3, appears to be stronger than our result, his lower limit is only strictly applicable to the scale-free\npower-law density profile of infinite extent. It appears that\n\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 + 1 actually constrains the asymptotic behavior of the\ndensity power index and the anisotropy parameter at infinity\nrather than at the center.\n\nWe thank P.

We argue that it is almost always possible to reduce most well-behaving\nDFs to the form of equation (1). That is, for a general DF of a spherically symmetric system in equilibrium, the reduction is\npossible if there exists \u03b1 < 2 such that\nfE (E) = lim L\u03b1 f (E, L),\n(13)\nL\u21920\n\nwhere fE (E) should be finite and nonzero for values of E at least in some nonempty subset of all the accessible values of\nE \u2208 [0, \u03c80 ].
