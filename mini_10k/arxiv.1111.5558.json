How could the Planck length, lP = h\u0304G/c3 \u223c 10\u221235 m, affect our understanding of space-time and quantum theory? To have a chance to answer this question, we\nshould first understand how lP could be made compatible with the principles of relativity and\ngeneral covariance. The tension between the coexistence of relativity and an invariant length\nscale is mainly due to our view that space-time assumes a Minkowskian continuous structure\nup to arbitrarily short scales. In this sense, to accommodate lP within our physical theories\nit may be useful to follow Riemann's advise and modify conventional geometric concepts as\none applies them both in the direction of the immeasurably large , and in the direction of the\nimmeasurably small. Einstein modified the space-time structure and dynamics at large scales,\nbut kept the Minkowskian structure locally. Here it will be shown that a further revision of\nthe classical space-time structure and dynamics at microscopic scales allows to introduce lP in\nan invariant and universal way compatible with general covariance. The resulting theory has\ninteresting phenomenological aspects. On the one hand, we find that particles with different\nenergy-momentum densities perceive different background geometries, a property closely related\nto doubly or deformed special relativity (DSR) [1, 2] and its gravitational extension, known as\nRainbow Gravity (RG) [3]. On the other hand, the cosmological dynamics of the theory closely\nmatches that of GR at all times except near the big bang singularity, which is replaced by a\nregular bounce that occurs near the Planck density.\nPalatini approach to the idea of fundamental length. Special relativity was built by\nrequiring that the speed of light were an invariant and universal magnitude. To combine the\nspeed of light and the Planck length in a way that preserves the invariant and universal nature\nof both quantities, we first note that c2 has the dimensions of a squared velocity but that c is not\n1\n\nPublished under license in Journal of Physics: Conference Series by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n\fa 3-velocity. Analogously, we may see lP2 as an invariant with dimensions of length squared but\nlP not being a 3-length2 . Dimensional compatibility with a curvature suggests that lP2 \u2261 1/RP\ncould be introduced in the theory via the gravitational sector. The situation is not as simple as\nit may seem at first because an action like\nh\u0304\nS[g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c8] =\n16\u03c0lP2\n\nZ\n\ni\n\u221a h\nd4 x \u2212g R + lP2 R2 + Sm [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c8] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Sm [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c8] represents the matter sector, contains lP but not in the invariant form that we\nwished. In fact, the field equations that follow from (1) are equivalent to those of a Brans-Dicke\ntheory with \u03c6 \u2261 1 + 2R/RP , a non-zero potential V (\u03c6) = R4P (\u03c6 \u2212 1)2 , and w = 0 [4]. As is\nwell-known, in Brans-Dicke theory the observed Newton's constant is promoted to the status\nof field: Gef f \u223c G/\u03c6. This allows the effective Newton's constant Gef f to change in time and\nin space and, which makes lPef f also vary in space and time. This is quite different from the\nassumed constancy and universality of the speed of light in special relativity and is closer to the\nphilosophy of varying speed of light theories [5]. The situation does not improve if we introduce\nhigher curvature invariants in (1) because they generate new degrees of freedom which turn\nNewton's constant into a dynamical field.\nA way out of this problem can be found by modifying the geometric structure of the theory. If\nwe construct the theory \u00e0 la Palatini [6], that is in terms of a connection not a priori constrained\nto be given by the Christoffel symbols, then the resulting equations do not necessarily contain\nnew dynamical degrees of freedom (as compared to GR), and the Planck length may remain\nspace-time independent in much the same way as the speed of light. The field equations that\nfollow from (1) when metric and connection are varied independently are\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\n1\n\u2212gfR g\u03b2\u03b3 = 0 ,\nfR R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393) \u2212 f g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\u03b1\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f = R + lP2 R2 , fR \u2261 \u2202R f , and \u03ba2 \u2261 8\u03c0G. The connection equation can be easily\nsolved after noticing that the trace of (2), RfR \u2212 2f = \u03ba2 T , represents an algebraic relation\nbetween R \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393) and T , which implies that R = R(T ) and hence fR = fR (T ). For the\nparticular Lagrangian (1), we find that R = \u2212\u03ba2 T , like in GR. The connection turns out to\nbe the Levi-Civita connection of an auxiliary metric h\u03bc\u03bd conformally related with the physical\nmetric, h\u03bc\u03bd = fR (T )g\u03bc\u03bd . We can now rewrite (2) as follows\nG\u03bc\u03bd (h) =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\n\u03ba2\n\u2212hh\u03b2\u03b3 = 0 ,\nT\u03bc\u03bd + \u039b(T )h\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\u03b1\nfR (T )\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u039b(T ) \u2261 (f \u2212 RfR )/(2fR2 ) = \u2212(\u03ba2 T )2 lP2 . Note that fR\u03ba(T ) \u2261 8\u03c0G/(1 \u2212 \u03ba2 T /RP )\nand the function \u039b(T ) can be seen as a T -dependent Newton's constant and cosmological constant, respectively. This structure is very similar to that proposed in [3] for RG,\nG\u03bc\u03bd (E) = 8\u03c0G(E)T\u03bc\u03bd (E) + g\u03bc\u03bd \u039b(E), with the difference that the energy E of the particle\nprobing the geometry is here replaced by T which is a generally covariant function of its energydensity. From the structure of (3) and the relation g\u03bc\u03bd = (1/fR )h\u03bc\u03bd , it follows that g\u03bc\u03bd is affected\nby the matter-energy in two different ways. The first contribution corresponds to the cumulative effects of matter, and the second contribution is due to the dependence on the local density\ndistributions of energy and momentum. In fact, the structure of (3) is similar to that of GR,\nwhich implies that h\u03bc\u03bd is determined by integrating over all the sources (gravity as a cumulative\neffect). Besides that, g\u03bc\u03bd is also affected by the local sources via the factor fR\u22121 (T ). To illustrate\n2\n\nNote that this idea is radically different from lattice-type approaches to the problem of a minimum length.\n\n\fthis point, consider a region of the spacetime containing a total mass M and filled with sources\nof low energy-density as compared to the Planck scale (|\u03ba2 T /RP | \u226a 1). For the quadratic\nmodel f (R) = R + R2 /RP , in this region (3) boils down to G\u03bc\u03bd (h) = \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd + O(\u03ba2 T /RP ), and\nh\u03bc\u03bd \u2248 (1 + O(\u03ba2 T /RP ))g\u03bc\u03bd , which implies that the GR solution is a very good approximation\n. This confirms that h\u03bc\u03bd is determined by an integration over the sources, like in GR. Now, if\nthis region is traversed by a particle of mass m \u226a M but with a non-negligible ratio \u03ba2 T /RP ,\nthen the contribution of this particle to h\u03bc\u03bd can be neglected, but its effect on g\u03bc\u03bd via de factor\nfR\u22121 = 1 \u2212 \u03ba2 T /RP on the region that supports the particle (its classical trajectory) is important. This phenomenon is analogous to that described in RG, where particles of different energies\n(energy-densities in our case) perceive different metrics. Our approach, however, naturally cures\nthe so-called soccer ball problem for macroscopic bodies thanks to the dependence of the metric on\nthe local energy-momentum densities rather than on the total energy-momentum of the particle.\nBeyond f (R) theories. The energy-density properties of the Palatini theory (1) is\nmaintained with a much richer phenomenology when the f (R) family is extended to Palatini\nf (R, Q) Lagrangians, where Q \u2261 R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd , and R\u03bc\u03bd is the symmetric Ricci tensor. In this\ncase, the connection can also be expressed as the Levi-Civita connection of a metric h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd related\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a3 \u03bd\n\u03b1\nwith g\u03bc\u03bd by h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = g\u221adet\n, where \u03a3\u03b1 \u03bd = fR \u03b4\u03b1\u03bd + 2fQ P\u03b1 \u03bd and P\u03bc \u03bd = R\u03bc\u03b1 g\u03b1\u03bd are functions of\n\u03a3\nT\u03bc \u03bd = T\u03bc\u03b1 g\u03b1\u03bd and, therefore, depend on the local densities of energy and momentum (see [7, 8]\nfor details). The field equations for the metric can be written in compact form as\nf\n1\n( \u03b4\u03bc \u03bd + \u03ba2 T\u03bc \u03bd ) .\nR\u03bc \u03bd (h\u0303) = p\ndet \u03a3\u0302 2\n\n(4)\n\nFor a scalar field with kinetic energy \u03c7 \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 and Lagrangian L = \u03c7 + 2V (\u03c6), h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd and\ng\u03bc\u03bd turn out to be related by\ng\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n\u039b2\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6\nh\u0303\u03bc\u03bd +\n\u03a9\n\u039b1 + \u03c7\u039b2\n\n(5)\n\n2fQ \u03bb + f2R , \u039b2 =\n2fQ (\u2212\u03bb \u00b1\nwhere \u03a9 = [\u039b1 (\u039b1 + \u03c7\u039b2 )]1/2 , \u039b1 =\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bb = f /2 + fR /8fQ \u2212 \u03ba L/2. For the particular model f (R, Q) = R \u2212\nenergy-density limit |\u03ba2 L/RP | \u226a 1 leads to\np\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd (h\u0303) \u2248 \u03ba2\n\np\n\n\"\n\n\u03ba2\nV\n(V \u2212 \u03c7\u0303)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 +\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd +\n2\nRP\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\np\n\n\u03bb2 + \u03ba2 \u03c7)/\u03c7, and\nQ\nR2\n2RP + RP , the low\n\n2\u03ba2 V 2 + \u03ba2 \u03c7\u03032\n4\n\n!\n\nh\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n\n#\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is in agreement with GR up to corrections of order O(1/RP ). Note that to this order\n\u03c7 \u2248 h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c7\u0303. Similarly as in the f (R) case, this indicates that h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd is mainly determined\nby integrating over the sources (cumulative effects of gravity), whereas \u03a9 and the last term of\n(5) represent the local energy-density contributions to the metric. The DSR limit of this theory\ncan be obtained by neglecting the cumulative effects of gravity, which corresponds to the limit\nh\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2248 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd . In this limit, for the f (R, Q) model of above the metric becomes\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2248 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\n2\u03ba2\n(V \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6) + O\n+\nRP\n\n1\nRP2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nFrom (7) we see that the leading order corrections to the Minkowski metric are strongly\nsuppressed by inverse powers of the Planck curvature, which indicates that a perturbative study\nof such contributions in field theories should be feasible at low energy densities (see [7] for\n\n\fmore details). At high densities, however, non-perturbative effects arise. To illustrate this\npoint, consider the scalar Q in the f (R, Q) model of above with a perfect fluid of density \u03c1 and\npressure P\nQ=\n\n3RP2\n8\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f01 \u2212\n\n2\u03ba2 (\u03c1\n\n+ P)\n\nRP\n\n+\n\n2\u03ba4 (\u03c1\n\n3P )2\n\n\u2212\n3RP2\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n\n1\u2212\n\n4\u03ba2 (\u03c1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n+ P)\uf8fb\n\nRP\n\n\u2248 QGR +\n\n3(P + \u03c1)3\n+ ... .\n2RP\n\n(8)\nAt low densities the GR solution is recovered but, as\napproaches unity, important\ndepartures from GR must arise to avoid that the argument of the square root of (8) becomes\nnegative. This implies that \u03c1 and P must be bounded if the dynamics is to be consistent. And\nthis is so regardless of the symmetries of the theory. In the case of an isotropic FRW universe\nwith constant equation of state w = P/\u03c1, the Hubble function in the spatially flat case is [9]\n4\u03ba2 (\u03c1+P )\nRP\n\nf + \u03ba2 (\u03c1 + 3P )\n1\n,\nH =\nh\ni2\n6(\u039b1 \u2212 \u039b2 )\n1 + 32 \u22061\n2\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u22061 = \u2212(1 + w)\u03c1\u2202\u03c1 \u03a9. At low densities, this expression exactly recovers the linear \u03c1dependence of GR, but near the Planck scale, when \u03ba2 \u03c1/RP \u223c 0.1, its behavior changes reaching\na maximum and then vanishing at a higher density, which implies a cosmic bounce (see [7, 9] for\nillustrative plots). These isotropic bouncing solutions occur for all equations of state comprised\nwithin the interval \u22121 < w < 11 and persist in anisotropic (Bianchi I) spacetimes [9]. It should\nbe noted that the effective dynamics of isotropic loop quantum cosmology [10] for a massless\nscalar was exactly reproduced by an f (R) Palatini theory in [11]. The extension of that result\nto other matter sources and spacetimes with less symmetry could be naturally implemented in\nthe context of f (R, Q) theories.\nIn this talk I have shown that without imposing any a priori phenomenological structure,\nPalatini models predict an energy-density dependence of the geometry that closely matches\nthe structure conjectured by Magueijo and Smolin in [3, 2] but without the problems of that\napproach. At the same time, it avoids the big bang singularity in quite general situations and for\nreasonable sources of matter and energy such as dust and radiation. This confirms that Palatini\ntheories represent a new and powerful framework to address different aspects of quantum gravity\nphenomenology. An important lesson that can be extracted from this analysis is that quantum\ngravitational phenomena associated with a minimum length scale may arise non-perturbatively,\nbeing the perturbative corrections strongly suppressed.\nAcknowledgments.
