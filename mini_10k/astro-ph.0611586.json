INTRODUCTION\n\nStar formation is a highly clustered process. A\nlarge fraction of stars form in clusters, as determined in our local Galactic neighborhood (Lada & Lada\n2003), in interacting galaxies like the Antennae\n(Fall, Chandar, & Whitmore 2005), and in dwarf starburst galaxies such as NGC 5253 (Tremonti et al. 2001).\nThe most massive star clusters, & 105 M\u2299 , are known as\nsuper star clusters (SSCs), and examples are found in all\nof these galactic types (Clark et al. 2005; Mengel et al.\n2002; Turner, Beck, & Ho 2000).\nThe study of SSCs is important for a number of reasons. Their extreme physical properties present new\nchallenges for star-formation theories. For example, their\nlarge masses and relatively small sizes mean that their\nnatal gas clouds must have very high pressures due to\nElectronic address: jdowell@astro.indiana.edu\nElectronic address: buckaleb@erau.edu\nElectronic address: jt@astro.ufl.edu\n4 Previous Address:\nDept. of Physics & Astronomy\nUniversity of Wyoming\n1000 E.

The stellar densities of the final clusters are not likely to be that much\ngreater than typical rich young Galactic star clusters,\nsuch as the Orion Nebula Cluster, but if the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) is similar, then there are more massive\nOB stars present, potentially thousands within just a few\nparsecs of each other.\nYoung SSCs are likely to be similar to the progenitors of globular clusters (Gonz\u00e1les-Delgado et al. 1997;\nZhang & Fall 1999) although this requires an evolution\nof the initial cluster mass function (ICMF) from a powerlaw form to a log-normal form, likely to occur through\npreferential disruption of lower-mass clusters. Thus,\nstudying nearby populations of SSCs may shed light on\nprocesses similar to those occurring in the early phases\nof galaxy formation.\nFrom a practical point of view, young SSCs are the easiest clusters to identify in magnitude limited surveys of\nexternal galaxies, and so corrections for incompleteness\nare relatively small, allowing for more accurate determination of the ICMF. However, a disadvantage is that\nSSCs are relatively rare, so a large sample of galaxies\nneeds to be surveyed to build up a good statistical sample.\nWhile SSCs occur in many different types of galac-\n\n\f2\ntic environments, there are many prominent examples in irregular and dwarf irregular galaxies.\nFor example, NGC 5253 hosts a 106 M\u2299 SSC\n(Turner, Beck, & Ho 2000), Henize 2 \u2212 10 hosts several\nforming SSCs as revealed in the radio and mm continuum\n(Kobulnicky & Johnson 1999; Johnson & Kobulnicky\n2003), NGC 1569 hosts three SSCs (Gilbert & Graham\n2003), SBS 0335-052 hosts a 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 cluster\n(Plante & Sauvage 2002), and NGC 1705 and IC 4662\nhost SSCs (Johnson, Indebetouw, & Pisano 2003). Several other dwarf starburst galaxies with SSCs are described by Beck, Turner, & Kovo (2000).\nBillett, Hunter, & Elmegreen (2002) discussed how the\nmost massive cluster in a galaxy depends on the mass\nfunction and the size of the galaxy (see also Hunter et al.\n2003). They argued that the most massive clusters in\ndwarf irregular galaxies are more massive than would be\nexpected if their star cluster populations are similar to\nthose of normal disk galaxies. They suggested that this\nresult could imply that the ICMF of dwarf galaxies is\nnot a continuous power law and that the SSCs have a\ndifferent origin perhaps related to special galactic circumstances, such as an interaction with another galaxy.\nHowever, care needs to be taken with the selection of\nthe galaxy sample; for example, if only dwarf irregular\ngalaxies with prominent SSCs are considered, then the\nresult will be biased. The continuity of the ICMF in\ndwarf galaxies is an issue that we specifically address in\nthis paper. It is important to quantify potential differences in the ICMFs in different types of galaxies since it\nmay illustrate how the star-formation process responds\nto environmental factors.\nTo characterize properly the masses of a population of\nstar clusters, we need to measure the ICMF. We shall see\nthat it can often be well fit by a power law,\ndN (M )\n(1)\n\u221d M \u2212\u03b1M .\ndM\nThe masses of clusters are not easily determined observationally. Dynamical masses from spectroscopic\nstudies have been possible only for a handful of\nSSCs (Mengel et al. 2002; McCrady, Gilbert, & Graham\n2003). Most previous studies of cluster populations have\nconcentrated on the luminosity function (LF), which also\noften resembles a power law,\ndN (L)\n(2)\n\u221d L\u2212\u03b1L .\ndL\nFrom a sample of spiral galaxies, Larsen (2002) found\n2.0 . \u03b1L . 2.4.\nIn the Antennae galaxies,\nWhitmore et al. (1999) found \u03b1L \u2243 2.1. Fall (2006)\nhas discussed the relations between luminosity and mass\nfunctions in more detail.\nFor unresolved clusters, conversion from luminosity\nto mass requires knowledge of the age, metallicity, and\nreddening of the cluster together with a model for the\ncluster's stellar evolution and an assumed IMF for the\nstars. Multi-color photometry is a minimum observational requirement for performing this conversion on a\ncluster-by-cluster basis and is the approach adopted in\nthis paper using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data.\nBillett, Hunter, & Elmegreen (2002) performed a similar\nanalysis for nearby dwarf irregular galaxies using a heterogeneous dataset from the HST archives. Their study\n\nhas the advantage of high spatial resolution, but the disadvantage of a limited spectral coverage (and thus more\nof an uncertain conversion from luminosity to mass).\nHunter et al. (2003) used ground-based data to study the\ncluster populations of the Large and Small Magellanic\nClouds, concluding that 2.0 . \u03b1M . 2.4. Zhang & Fall\n(1999) found \u03b1M \u2243 2 for young (.160 Myr) clusters\nwith masses 104 . M . 106 M\u2299 in the merging galaxies NGC 4038/4039 using multi-wavelength, broadband\nHST photometry. Based on the LFs of Galactic HII regions, McKee & Williams (1997) concluded \u03b1M \u2243 2 for\nclusters and associations.\nAlternatively, the conversion from luminosity to mass\ncan be made on a statistical basis, given assumptions\nabout the star-formation history. Larsen (2002) showed\nthat a cluster population with mass function with \u03b1M =\n2 from 103 M\u2299 < M < 105 M\u2299 and a uniform distribution\nof ages between 107 and 109 yr has an approximately\npower-law LF in the range \u221211 < MV < \u22128 with \u03b1L =\n2.72.\nComparisons of ICMFs in different galaxy types are interesting because it informs us about the star-formation\nprocess and how it may depend on different physical conditions. For example, Elmegreen & Efremov (1997) argued for a universal formation mechanism for open and\nglobular clusters because the ICMF was similar to the\nmass spectrum of interstellar clouds. Differences in the\nmass function between dwarf galaxies and normal disk\ngalaxies would cast doubt upon this assertion. Dwarf\ngalaxies have quite different physical properties compared to normal disk galaxies such as typically lower\nmetallicities and less shear due to differential rotation,\nand the influence of these factors on the star-formation\nprocess may imprint itself on the ICMF.\nIn this paper, we determine the ICMF for 13 irregular galaxies within 10 Mpc with data obtained from the\nfifth data release (DR5) of the SDSS. We compare this\nto the ICMF derived from SDSS DR5 data of three spiral galaxies, also within 10 Mpc. In Section 2, we discuss the SDSS DR5 data, the selection of our two galaxy\nsamples (irregulars and spirals), and the procedures for\nfinding clusters and deriving their magnitudes. Section\n3 deals with extinction, age, and mass determinations of\nthe individual star clusters. We consider the ICMF in\nSection 4; in particular we ask if the ICMFs of irregular and spiral galaxies are consistent with being drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution. We fit the observed\nICMFs with power laws and derive their parameters. We\ndiscuss the implications of our findings in Section 5 and\nsummarize in Section 6.\n2. SDSS DATA AND PHOTOMETRY\n2.1. Sample Selection\n\nThe galaxies used in this study, listed in Table 1,\ncame from a search of the Third Reference Catalog of\nBright Galaxies (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991, hereafter\nRC3). The selection criteria for RC3 galaxies were a B\nmagnitude \u226415, a Hubble stage number of 9.0\u221210.0, and\na radial velocity \u2264750 km s\u22121 (i.e., a distance \u226410 Mpc\nassuming H0 =75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). The list of galaxies\nwas then cross referenced to determine the inclusion in\nSDSS DR5 (Adleman-McCarthy et al. 2007), producing\n13 galaxies, which defines our irregular galaxy sample.\nSDSS DR5 g \u2032 images of these galaxies are shown in Fig-\n\n\f3\nures 1-3.\nWe also studied a small sample of three spiral galaxies\nwith SDSS data (NGC 4571, NGC 4713, NGC 5457),\nranging between Hubble types Sb and Sd, and distances\nfrom 5.8 to 9.5 Mpc (see Table 1). SDSS DR5 g \u2032 images\nof these galaxies are presented in Figure 3.\n2.2. Photometry\nThe only post-processing necessary for the SDSS images was to register those images (u\u2032 , i\u2032 , and z \u2032 ) with respect to the g \u2032 image coordinate system for each galaxy.\nClusters were located using the SExtractor automatic\ncatalog generation routine (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) on\nthe SDSS g \u2032 image of each galaxy. Young clusters are\nexpected to be generally brightest in this band. To aid\nin the location of potential clusters embedded in the diffuse light the images were convolved with a Mexican-hat\nprofile, with a FWHM comparable to the stellar PSF. We\nselected objects with signal-to-noise \u2265 1.5, chosen after\nsome experimentation as the optimum value to allow selection of relatively faint clusters but without too many\nfalse detections.\nOnce the candidates were located, SExtractor was used\nto perform flux measurements in all four bands using elliptical Kron apertures of these objects. During these\nmeasurements, as part of the automated process, the influences of nearby objects were taken into account and\nmasked. The degree of crowding of the typical star cluster environments in the irregular and spiral galaxy samples are similar although there is substantial variation\nwithin each sample.\nOnce the fluxes and apertures for each potential cluster\nwere returned, the list of potential clusters was filtered\nto remove candidates with large photometric errors because of apertures that extend too close to frame edges or\nthat overlap too much with adjacent sources. We also removed objects with sizes \u2265 1.5 times that of the median\nstellar aperture, which corresponds to a size of about\n50 pc at a typical distance of 5 Mpc, since these objects\nare likely to be blends of multiple clusters.\nNext, the ratio of instrumental fluxes, f , to the reference flux, f0 , of cluster candidates were corrected for\natmospheric extinction via\n\nf /f0 \u22120.4(a+k\u00d7ma )\n10\n,\n(3)\n54s\nwhere a is the magnitude zero-point for the given bandpass, k is the extinction coefficient, and ma is the airmass. All parameters were obtained from the SDSS exposure parameter file associated with each science image.\nOnce this correction has been made, the true fluxes are\nconverted to magnitudes on the inverse hyperbolic sine\nmagnitude system using\n2.5\nsinh\u22121 ((f /f0 )true /(2b) + ln(b)),\n(4)\nm=\u2212\nln(10)\n(f /f0 )true =\n\nwhere b is a band-dependent softening parameter (see\nLupton, Gunn, & Szalay 1999, for a complete description).\nFor each irregular and spiral galaxy, local Galactic extinction was removed using the value of AV obtained\nfrom the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED).\nWe converted this extinction to the u\u2032 g \u2032 i\u2032 z \u2032 system using\nTable 6 of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998).\n\nAbsolute u\u2032 , i\u2032 , and z \u2032 magnitudes for each cluster were also computed using distances from literature\nsearches. For all galaxies except NGC 4214, the distance\nwas calculated from the radial velocities corrected for\nthe infall of the Local Group toward the Virgo cluster\n(Terry, Paturel, & Ekholm 2002) and a Hubble constant\nof 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . For NGC 4214, the distance given\nin Ma\u0131\u0301z-Alpell\u00e1niz, Cieza, & MacKenty (2002) was used.\n3. DETERMINATION OF EXTINCTION, AGE, AND MASS\nVIA THE COLOR3 PLOT\n\n3.1. Evolutionary Models\n\nStarburst99 version 5.0 (Leitherer et al. 1999) spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) were generated for an instantaneous burst model with 106 M\u2299 total cluster mass,\nSalpeter IMF, upper and lower stellar mass limits of\n0.1M\u2299 and 120M\u2299, ages 0.01 Myr to 1 Gyr in steps of 0.5\nMyr, and metallicities of Z = 0.004, 0.008, and 0.02. The\nmodel SEDs include contributions from both the stellar\ncomponent and a nebular continuum (see Leitherer et al.\n1999, for a description of the nebular conditions modeled). The u\u2032 g \u2032 i\u2032 z \u2032 magnitudes were generated from these\nmodel SEDs to derive the extinctions, ages, and masses\nfound below. Model colors were used for age determination while model absolute magnitudes were used for mass\ndetermination.\n3.2. Overview of Color3\n\nThe color3 (color versus color versus color) method\nthat we introduce here is an improvement of the age determination method of Hunter et al. (2003). The method\nis improved by using three broadband colors rather than\ntwo to decrease the effects of color degeneracy encountered between 7 and 21 Myr, and it also attempts to\nestimate the metallicity of the galaxy by minimizing the\nglobal uncertainty in the derived reddening. The color3\nmethod consists of two routines: the dereddening routine and the mass determination routine. Internal reddening is determined by shifting the cluster colors along\nan RV = 3.1 reddening line in the color-color-color plot\nuntil the clusters reach a minimum (least-squares) distance from the model curve. The minimum distance was\ndetermined by computing all possible reddening values\nbetween a cluster's initial position and the bluest u\u2032 \u2212 g \u2032\nand g \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 model colors in increments of 0.005 mag. In\nthe event that removing any additional reddening from\nthe cluster results in it moving away from the model on\nthe color-color-color diagram an AV of zero is adopted.\nThe length of the translation is then converted into an\nAV for the star cluster, and reddening corrections are\napplied to the absolute magnitudes.\nAt this point, an age and its uncertainties can be derived for the cluster by determining the model age corresponding to the closest model point to the cluster. The\nuncertainties of the colors are first translated the same\nAV length along the reddening line toward the model\ncurve. Next, the uncertainties are used to define an ellipsoidal region. This region is then divided into subregions where the central colors of each are compared to\nthe model in order to find their corresponding ages. The\ngreatest age found is taken to be the upper limit while\nthe least is taken to be the lower limit. After cluster\nages and uncertainties were derived from the observed\ncolors, the minimum age uncertainty of each cluster was\n\n\f4\nset to the larger of 10% of the age or 1 Myr, based on\nthe expected systematic uncertainties in the star cluster models and the expected age spreads of massive star\nclusters (Tan & McKee 2004).\nThis method is carried out on all three model metallicities, and the results compared. The comparison examines the number of clusters for which ages have been determined and selects the model that results in the largest\nnumber of clusters. The metallicity associated with this\nmodel is taken to be the metallicity of the galaxy. This\ntechnique is equivalent to minimizing the global error\nbetween the observed colors and those predicted by the\nmodel. In the event that two or more models have the\nsame number of clusters, the reddening dispersion is then\ncompared. The model that corresponds to the minimum\nreddening dispersion is taken to be the correct metallicity. We expect the derived reddening to be constrained\nacross the galaxy as many of the galaxies in our sample are face-on. The galaxies being face-on implies that\nreddening experienced by any given star cluster should\nbe dominated by the Galactic reddening in all but the\nyoungest clusters. It should be noted that this method\ndoes not serve as a rigorous determination of the metallicity of each galaxy.\nFor this work, the three broadband colors used were\nu\u2032 \u2212 g \u2032 , g \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032 , and i\u2032 \u2212 z \u2032 . The u\u2032 \u2212 g \u2032 and g \u2032 \u2212 i\u2032\ncolors were chosen to help differentiate between young\nclusters and older stellar populations. The i\u2032 \u2212 z \u2032 color\nwas chosen since these two filters are not significantly\naffected by emission lines. Figure 4 shows an example\nof how this method derived the reddening and age of\na 5.81+1.00\n\u22121.00 Myr cluster in DDO 165 in addition to the\ndereddened colors of all clusters in DDO 165.\nOnce an age and its uncertainty has been determined,\nthe mass determination routine is called. This routine\nuses an age and three absolute magnitudes to determine\na mass for the cluster via the ratio of the observed flux\nin each of the three bandpasses to the model fluxes. The\nuncertainty in the mass is determined by using the uncertainties in the absolute magnitudes as well as the uncertainty in the age. The absolute magnitudes u\u2032 , i\u2032 , and\nz \u2032 were used in this work for mass determination since\ng \u2032 is more susceptible to contamination due to nebular\nemission lines.\n3.3. Age Limit to Select Young Cluster\n\nWe focus on young (\u2264 20 Myr) clusters as these\nprobe the initial cluster mass function most directly. From observations of clusters in the Milky\nWay (Lada & Lada 2003) and other galaxies (e.g.\nFall, Chandar, & Whitmore 2005), it appears as if a\nlarge fraction of clusters suffer from \"infant mortality\",\ni.e. they are only weakly gravitationally bound, if at\nall, and suffer disruption so the mass function of older\nclusters is significantly modified from the ICMF. The\nyounger clusters also have a higher light-to-mass ratio so\na magnitude limited survey can probe their mass function down to smaller masses than is possible for older\nclusters. The age limit of 20 Myr also counters the problem of heavy foreground Galactic stellar contamination\nin the 20-50 Myr age range.\nTable 2 contains the positions; absolute magnitudes;\nand derived reddenings, ages, and masses for the young\nclusters that comprise our sample. Note that this table\n\nis available in full in the electronic version of the paper.\nThe locations of these clusters in their host galaxies are\ncircled in the g \u2032 images found in Figures 1-3.\n3.4. Sources of Contamination\n\nSince we focused on the youngest star clusters,\nemission-line contamination of the broadband colors was\npossible. In addition, since the star-formation histories\nof these galaxies are unknown, red stellar populations\nfrom an earlier epoch may contaminate the star cluster\ncolors. We removed those clusters from our ICMF analysis that had apparent red stellar population contamination and emission line contamination using the method\ndescribed by Hunt, Thuan, & Izotov (2003). These considerations were used to create the excluded color region\nneeded by the dereddening routine. An additional filter\nwas applied to remove candidate clusters whose dereddened colors were greater than 3\u03c3 and 0.50 mag away\nfrom the model colors. This relatively high level of 3\u03c3\nwas chosen to counteract the color3 method's tendency\nto exclude clusters with small photometric uncertainties.\nThe 0.50 mag floor was added to address systematic uncertainties and includes considerations for uncertainties\nin the metallicities, reddening, and photometry. Of the\n2,184 potential star clusters identified in this survey, only\n48 (2.2%) were rejected by the color filters or by being\n3\u03c3 and 0.5 mag away from the theoretical model colors.\nOur subsequent analysis will assume that there is no bias\nintroduced by this cut.\nAnother source of contamination is from foreground\nstars, background galaxies, supergiants, and stellar\nblends. Using SDSS data helps limit the likelihood of\nimaging foreground stars by restricting the galaxy sample to high Galactic latitudes. To determine the contamination level due to foreground stars and background\ngalaxies we examined the fields around the 13 irregular\ngalaxies. Using SExtrator, we created a sample of field\nobjects and applied the same selection criteria to them as\nwe did the clusters. This field sample then had ages and\nmasses derived using color3. This allowed us to estimate\nthe sky density of these stars and galaxies to be, on average, 0.28 contaminants per square arcminute. From this,\nwe estimate that both the irregular and spiral galaxy\nsamples are contaminated below the 10% level.\nSupergiants and stellar blends are dealt with using a\nmass cut-off of 104.4 M\u2299 . Hence, all clusters with masses\nbelow this level are expected to have some degree of contamination. This cut-off is roughly equivalent to excluding young clusters with MV > \u22129. Subsequent analysis\nin this paper will ignore lower-mass clusters.\nA summary of the effect on the sample sizes for the various rejection methods used in this paper can be found in\nTable 3. It should be noted that relatively large fractions\nof identified sources are rejected at the various stages of\nthis analysis. Most of these are because of poor photometry (in any of the four bands), which can be due to the\nclusters being relatively faint, in relatively crowded regions, or extended (and thus likely to be blends of more\nthan one cluster).\n3.5. Sources of Systematic Error\nThe variety of rejection methods introduced to deal\nwith the relatively poor angular resolution of the SDSS\ndata (see \u00a72.2) and the various sources of contamination\n\n\f5\n(\u00a73.4) are potential sources of systematic error. From\nTable 3 it is clear that the size of the initial sample is\naffected most by rejection techniques that use a combination of SExtractor quality flags and photometric aperture\nsize. The initial sample selection is strongly influenced\nby the angular resolution, especially in regions where\nthe diffuse galactic light is prominent. The detection\nmethod described in \u00a72.2 minimizes the effect of diffuse\nlight on source selection for the majority of the starforming area of each galaxy. Detections in the nuclear\nregions, however, are still limited due to a combination\nof strong galactic light and the proximity of sources to\neach other. This proximity makes it difficult to estimate\nthe flux contributions of the other sources and increases\nthe uncertainty in the fluxes to > 10%. This has a potential to influence the derived ICMF in two ways. First,\nit reduces the overall number of clusters that are used to\ndetermine the ICMF and can increase the uncertainties\nin the power-law fits. Second, some galaxies (e.g., NGC\n4449, [B\u00f6ker et al. 2001]) have numerous young clusters\nthat are the result of a nuclear starburst. In not being able to accurately measure clusters that may be part\nof such a nuclear starburst, the initial sample may be\nskewed toward older clusters where sufficient time has\npassed so that \"infant mortality\" (Lada & Lada 2003),\nover the first 20 Myr, has altered at least the low-mass\nend of the ICMF. In addition, the rate of nuclear starburst activity may be different between the galaxies that\ncompose the irregular and spiral samples, thus leading to\ndifficulties in comparing the two derived ICMFs.\nThe photometric problem of many sources in close\nproximity to each other also manifests itself in regions where potential clusters themselves are highly clustered. If young star clusters preferentially form clustered\naround their parent giant molecular cloud (GMC), then\nexcluding these clusters would bias the selection method\nagainst the youngest clusters. Within each sample this\ncould lead to the ICMF being derived from a population\nof clusters that has already undergone some evolution\nand disruption. In addition, the degree of clustering in\nirregular and spiral galaxies may be different due to the\nlarge difference in galactic properties (Section 1). This\ndifference would make direct comparisons between the\ntwo samples more difficult.\nSubsequent analysis in this paper assumes that the potential systematic errors in the sample selection method\naffect both the irregular and spiral samples to the same\nextent. Furthermore, we assume that the potential systematic errors do not bias our derived ICMFs in such a\nway that a direct comparison between the two samples\nis inappropriate.\nSystematic errors can also be introduced by the color3\nanalysis method both through limitations in the analysis\napproach and through the low spatial resolution of the\ndata. de Grijs et al. (2005) reviewed a variety of broadband imaging techniques, including a multi-parameter\nminimization technique similar to the color3 method used\nhere, that are used to derive star cluster parameters. Using HST data for 17 clusters in NGC 3310 and 20 clusters\nin the Antennae galaxies they study the absolute systematic uncertainties associated with these broadband methods. In Tables A1-A10 of de Grijs et al. (2005) they find\nthat multi-parameter minimization techniques systematically derive higher cluster masses than other methods.\n\nHowever, they note that the relative age and mass distributions within a population of clusters are robust across\nthe various methods, i.e., observed features in either distribution are likely to be related to features in the true\ndistribution. Thus, any systematic errors introduced by\nthe analysis method are not likely to influence the overall\nshape of the derived ICMF.\n4. DERIVATION OF THE ICMF AND COMPARISON\nBETWEEN IRREGULAR AND SPIRAL GALAXIES\n\n4.1. Completeness Corrections\nThe completeness and sample bias corrections described by Larsen (1999) were applied to all galaxies with\n20 or more detected clusters. For these tests, 30 sets of\nrandomly generated artificial clusters with masses between \u223c 104.4 and 106.5 M\u2299 were inserted into the g \u2032\nimage of each galaxy. The number of artificial clusters\nwas set to one-quarter the number of clusters found. This\ndynamic factor helps to reduce overcrowding in smaller\ngalaxies while better sampling larger galaxies. The magnitudes used for these test clusters came from the appropriate metallicity Starburst99 models. We limited\nthe completeness and bias corrections to clusters more\nmassive than \u223c 104.4 M\u2299 to avoid contamination contributed by supergiants and stellar blends. The artificial\nclusters used in this test were uniformly distributed in\nage between 2 and 20 Myr. Masses were sampled from a\npower-law distribution with an index of -1.7. The spatial\ndistribution of these clusters was determined by fitting an\nellipse to the observed cluster distribution and altering\nthe semi-major axis until & 90% of the observed clusters\nwere contained in this ellipse. Once these parameters of\nthe ellipse were determined, the artificial clusters were\nrandomly distributed throughout its interior. As a final\nmeasure to insure that clusters generated were as authentic as possible, random amounts of reddening were\nadded to the model magnitudes. The reddening was uniformly distributed between an AV of 0.02 mag and the\nmedian reddening magnitudes determined for the particular galaxy. At this point, the artificial clusters were\nadded to the images using IRAF's \"mkobjects\" routine.\nOnce the artificial clusters were added to the images,\nthe SExtractor routine was executed on the images using the parameters found in \u00a72.1. The returned object\nlist was then compared with the list of artificial clusters\nto determine the number of clusters recovered. These\nresults were then averaged across the various samples to\narrive at the completeness corrections presented in Table\n4 for both the irregular and spiral samples. For the lowest\nmass bin that we consider, 104.40 \u2212104.60 M\u2299 , we estimate\nthat our method of finding young clusters is 79% complete for the irregular galaxy sample and 92% complete\nfor the spiral galaxy sample. Higher angular resolution\noptical searches by HST would help us to probe regions\nof diffuse stellar light deeper and detect the less massive\nclusters with a higher detection rate.\n4.2. Variation of Cluster Frequency within the Galaxy\n\nSamples\nIt should be noted that the frequency at which massive clusters appear in our galaxy samples varies greatly.\nFrom Table 1 we see that three galaxies dominate the\nirregular sample of massive (> 105 M\u2299 ) clusters: NGC\n\n\f6\n4449, NGC 4485/4490, and NGC 4656. Using our derived Hubble flow distances and the apparent B -band\nmagnitudes from the RC3 yields absolute magnitudes of\n\u221218.8, \u221217.5, and \u221218.7, respectively. This range of\nmagnitudes places these galaxies at the high end of the irregular galaxy luminosity distribution. Only one of these\ngalaxies, NGC 4656, has a classification other than ImB.\nIts classification of SB/Sm(p) is likely due to its optical\nappearance (see Figure 2) being almost linear, with the\npossible remnant of a spiral arm toward the northeast.\nIn the small spiral sample, NGC 5457 contributes\nabout 90% of the massive clusters. Thus, our comparison of the mass functions of the two galaxy samples is\nin essence a comparison of the clusters in NGC 5457 to\nthose in NGC 4449, NGC 4485/4490, and NGC 4656.\nLarger samples of galaxies are needed to improve upon\nthis situation.\n4.3. The Initial Cluster Mass Functions\nThe young (\u2264 20 Myr) clusters were binned logarithmically by mass using the bin-sizing method described\nin Scott (1979). This sizing procedure takes into consideration the standard deviation of the data along with\nthe total number of data points to reduce any bias introduced by binning. For our data set, this resulted in a bin\nsize of 0.20 dex. We applied completeness corrections to\neach bin and assumed a combination of Poissonian uncertainty and uniform systematic uncertainties of 30% in\nthe bin amplitudes. Histograms for both samples are presented in Figure 5. In each case, the distribution of clusters spans approximately the same range in mass. Thus,\ndespite being physically smaller and possessing different\ninternal conditions, irregulars are capable of producing\nclusters with the same mass range as spirals.\n(M)\n\u221d M \u2212\u03b1M , to the ICMF in\nWe fit power laws, dNdM\n5\n7.5\nthe range 10 M\u2299 < M < 10 M\u2299 , assuming errors for\neach bin that are a combination of Poisson and a 30%\nsystematic error added in quadrature. For the irregular\nICMF, we derive \u03b1M = 1.88 \u00b1 0.09 and for the spiral\nICMF we derive \u03b1M = 1.75\u00b10.06. The histograms along\nwith linear regression fits are plotted in Figure 6.\nThe power-law indicies that we derive for these ICMFs\nare comparable to, though somewhat shallower than,\nthose derived by some other researchers. For example,\nHunter et al. (2003) found an index of \u22122.0 to \u22122.4 for\nLMC and SMC clusters in the mass range \u223c103 \u2212106 M\u2299 .\nLarsen (2002) found an index of \u223c \u22122.0 for clusters in\ndisk galaxies. Zhang & Fall (1999) found the same index\nof \u22122 for young (.160 Myr) clusters with masses 104 .\nM . 106 M\u2299 in the merging galaxies NGC 4038/4039.\nCresci, Vanzi, & Sauvage (2004) found a index of \u22121.56\nfor young (. 20 Myr) clusters in the mass range \u223c 104 106 in the irregular galaxy NGC 5253.\nHowever, the absolute values of the power-law slopes\nare likely to be influenced by the differing spatial resolutions of these studies. In particular our analysis uses\nSDSS data with relatively poor spatial resolution compared to, for example, HST images so it is likely that\nsome of our more massive clusters are, in fact, blends\nof adjacent smaller clusters, and this could affect the\nshape of the derived ICMF. As an example of this kind of\neffect, in the Antennae galaxies Whitmore & Schweizer\n(1995) found a cluster LF with a power-law slope of \u22121.8\n\nusing pre-refurbished HST data while Whitmore et al.\n(1999) found a slope of \u22122.1 using higher resolution,\npost-refurbished HST data. In a future study, we will\nexamine this effect in a subset of our cluster samples using HST data.\nAnother factor that could lead to systematic variations\nin the cluster mass functions between different studies is\nthe varying amounts of spectral coverage of the observations, leading to different uncertainties in the accuracy of\nderived cluster ages, reddening, and masses. The SDSS\ndata that we use here have the advantage of a relatively\nbroad spectral coverage and is homogeneous across our\nsamples.\nFrom our results, there is some evidence from the\nlowest-mass bins (M < 105 M\u2299 ) in both the spiral\nand irregular samples that the single power-law description may break down at these masses, even after completeness corrections have been made. We detect relatively few clusters in the mass range 104.4 M\u2299 < M\n< 105 M\u2299 , and this contrasts with some previous studies\n(e.g., Hunter et al. 2003 study of the LMC and SMC). It\nis possible that our completeness correction has been underestimated; for example, some of the filtering that we\ncarry out for the cluster sample based on colors and nebular line contamination may tend to remove lower-mass\nclusters, and this possible bias is hard to quantify. Another possibility is that, again, the relatively poor spatial\nresolution of our galaxy images may cause us to group\ntogether associations of several smaller clusters into a\nsingle object, which we treat as a \"cluster\". The size of\nthe point-spread function is several tens of parsecs at the\ntypical distance of galaxies in our sample. This hypothesis could be tested by seeing if the young association (i.e.\ngroups of young stars within \u223c 50 pc of each other) mass\nfunctions in the LMC, SMC, and nearby spirals show a\nbreak at \u223c 105 M\u2299 .\nOur ICMF power-law index of \u22121.88\u00b10.09 for irregular\ngalaxies over the mass range 104.4 -107.5 M\u2299 is consistent\nwithin the uncertainties to that derived from the spiral\ngalaxy sample, i.e. \u22121.75 \u00b1 0.06.\nWe have also compared the spiral and irregular raw\nICMFs (i.e. with no completeness corrections applied)\nfor masses above 104.4 M\u2299 using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest. There are 321 such clusters in the irregular galaxies and 358 in the spirals. This test yields a p-value of\n0.633, indicating that the distributions are statistically\nindistinguishable.\n5. DISCUSSION: IMPLICATIONS FOR STAR-FORMATION\nTHEORIES\n\n5.1. Effect of Galactic Shear\n\nThe ICMFs in dwarf and spiral galaxies appear to be\nvery similar in spite of the relatively major differences\nbetween these galaxy types.\nIrregular galaxies tend to have rotation curves that are\nrising with increasing galactocentric radius. This contrasts with the more nearly flat rotation curves of typical spiral galaxies, such as those making up our sample of spirals. In particular NGC 5457 is classed with a\nHubble stage of 6.0 and has an extended Hubble type of\nSABcd(rs), indicating it is a mixed bar and non-barred\ntype, somewhere in between Sc and Sd in terms of the\nwinding of the arms, and the internal organization in\nthe galaxy consists of a mixture between an inner ring\n\n\f7\nand spiral arms. The rotation curve of this galaxy is not\nas flat as a classic, earlier-type spiral, i.e. it shows a\nsharp increase within the innermost 1 kpc, then is flat\nout to \u223c5 kpc, then increases again, peaking at about\n250 km s\u22121 around 8 kpc (Sofue et al. 1999). However,\nit should be noted that we do not generally have detailed information on the rotation curves of the galaxies\nin our irregular and spiral samples. A flat rotation curve\nmeans that gas experiences large shearing motions due\nto differential rotation in the disk. This enhances the\ncollision rate between GMCs (Tan 2000). Shear is absent in a rotation curve that rises linearly with radius\n(i.e. solid body rotation). The observed similarity of\nthe ICMFs in irregular and spiral galaxies implies that\nthe process determining the masses of clusters does not\ndepend on galactic shear and is, thus, probably operating on scales smaller than the tidal radius of giant\nmolecular clouds in a typical flat rotation curve spiral,\ni.e. . 100 pc. Zhang, Fall, & Whitmore (2001) and\nWhitmore et al. (2005) found a similar lack of influence\nof shearing velocity gradients on cluster formation in the\nAntennae galaxies.\nAccording to the model for star-cluster formation by\nElmegreen & Efremov (1997), the mass function of clusters reflects that of unstable interstellar gas clouds, and\na universal cluster mass function from galaxy to galaxy\nreflects the universal nature of turbulence, at least on\nscales relevant to star cluster formation. Our results are\nconsistent with this universal model.\nOne explanation for the global star formation rates in\ngalaxies (Kennicutt 1998) is the triggering of star formation by cloud collisions (Tan 2000), the rate of which\ndepends on the galactic shear rate. The main prediction of this model is a smaller star-formation efficiency\nper orbital time in irregular galaxies compared to spirals.\nThe data presented in this paper can be used to estimate\nglobal star-formation rates in these galaxies. With data\non the gas content of the star-forming regions of these\ngalaxies (e.g. Leroy et al. 2005), this question will be\nable to be addressed.\n5.2. Effect of Metallicity\nIrregular galaxies, being typically of smaller mass and\nwith a higher gas fraction than normal spiral galaxies,\ntend to have much lower metallicities. This does not appear to have any bearing on the ICMF. Note that the\nrange in metallicity of the Starburst99 models considered, Z \u223c 0.004-0.02, is not an accurate assessment of\nthe range in metallicities of our galaxy samples, and the\nmetallicity recorded in Table 2 for each galaxy is a somewhat arbitrary choice intended to maximize the number\nof clusters found by the color3 method (see \u00a73.2). Good\nmeasurements of the metallicities of the galaxies in our\nsamples are not generally available, so a more quantitative discussion of the range of metallicity over which the\nICMF is invariant is not possible at this stage.\nOne mechanism by which metallicity might be expected to affect star formation involves the degree of\nionization and heating inside molecular clouds due to\nfar-UV photons. In a higher metallicity cloud with a\nhigher dust-to-gas ratio and higher mean extinction, the\nfar-UV photons do not penetrate as easily. If magnetic\nfields are important for preventing GMC collapse and\nthus regulating star formation (McKee 1989) and if the\n\ncreation of magnetically super-critical regions occurs primarily via ambipolar diffusion in regions of low ionization, then one expects such regions to require smaller\namounts of shielding gas in a higher metallicity galaxy.\nIn other words, shielding a given mass of gas in a lowmetallicity galaxy requires it to be in the center of a\nmore massive GMC, i.e. with a larger total mass surface density, \u03a3, than in a high-metallicity galaxy. The\npressure due to the self-gravity of the gas will be of order\n\u2243 G\u03a32 , and the combination of higher pressure and more\nsurrounding material may lead to higher star-formation\nefficiencies and higher-mass clusters. See Tan & McKee\n(2004) for a more extensive discussion of feedback processes in forming SSCs. Since we do not observe such a\ndifference in the ICMFs of (presumably lower metallicity) irregulars and (presumably higher metallicity) spirals, we conclude that either magnetically super-critical\nregions are created by turbulent diffusion of field strength\nrather than ambipolar diffusion or that other processes,\nsuch as turbulent fragmentation, set the ICMF on scales\nsmaller than the super-critical regions of GMCs.\n5.3. Continuity of the ICMF\n\nSince the derived star cluster masses presented for the\nirregular galaxy sample cover a wide range of masses, we\nare able to examine the question of the continuity of the\nICMF discussed in Billett, Hunter, & Elmegreen (2002).\nThe significant linear correlation p-value (< 0.01) for the\npower-law fits implies that the ICMF is well modeled by\na single power law in the \u223c 104.4 -107.5 M\u2299 mass range.\nWe conclude that the ICMF in our sample of irregulars is\nwell described by a continuous power law. Due to completeness and stellar contamination issues in the lower\nmass bins, the only conclusion that can be drawn about\nthe issue of continuity is that if a break in the power law\nexists, it occurs for clusters with masses < 3 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 .\nIt should be noted that a power-law index of \u03b1M < 2\nimplies that the total star formation occurring in clusters (in a given mass range) is dominated by that in\nthe largest clusters. If the ICMF does not significantly\nsteepen below 5 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 , then our results imply that\nthe star formation in irregular and spiral galaxies is dominated by that occurring in SSCs or super associations.\nHowever, the derived power-law indicies of our ICMFs\nare close to \u22122, and at this value each logarithmic interval in cluster mass contributes equally to the total mass\nof new stars.\n5.4. Evolution of Extinction\n\nWe expect that younger clusters should suffer from a\ngreater amount of local extinction relative to older clusters. To test this hypothesis, we examined how the local\nextinction estimate for our clusters varied with cluster\nage. In Figure 7, we see an apparent decrease in the\ncluster extinction with age. We also note that there are\nno clusters younger than 5 Myr that have an AV less than\n0.1 mag while 15% of clusters in irregulars and 28% of\nclusters in spirals older than 5 Myr have an AV less than\n0.1 mag. Performing a linear fit between the extinctions\nand ages we derive that an average cluster in an irregular galaxy has AV decrease by 0.19 mag Myr\u22121 , while\nan average cluster in a spiral galaxy has AV decrease by\n0.16 mag Myr\u22121 .\n\n\f8\nThe above results imply that 5-10 Myr is the characteristic timescale for a cluster to destroy or move away from\nits natal molecular cloud, which is consistent with estimates of this timescale based on studies of young Galactic star clusters (Leisawitz, Bash, & Thaddeus 1989).\nWhitmore & Zhang (2002) and Mengel et al. (2005)\nhave found similar results from extragalactic studies of\nmassive young clusters.\nWe examined the mass dependence of these relations,\ndefining a \"low-mass\" sample from 104.4 to 105 M\u2299 and\na \"high-mass\" sample from 106 to 107.5 M\u2299 . The highmass clusters in irregular and spiral galaxies start with\nhigh values of mean AV at zero age of 5.29 and 5.41 mag,\nrespectively. The corresponding values for the low-mass\nclusters are 1.95 and 1.44 mag. The rates of decrease of\nAV are -0.29 and -0.33 mag Myr\u22121 for the high-mass clusters in irregular and spiral galaxies, respectively, while\nthe rates are \u22120.14 and \u22120.10 mag Myr\u22121 for the lowmass clusters, respectively. Thus the 5-10 Myr timescale\nfor reduction in extinction is similar for all these subsamples.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented the age and masses determined for\n321 young (\u2264 20 Myr) star clusters in 13 irregular galaxies and 358 young star clusters in three spiral galaxies\nbased on an automated analysis of SDSS data. From\nthis, we have found the irregular ICMF to be well fit by\n(M)\n\u221d M \u2212\u03b1M with \u03b1M = 1.88 \u00b1 0.09\na power law dNdM\nfor clusters over the 104.4 -107.5 M\u2299 mass range. The\n\nequivalent index for the spiral ICMF was found to be\n\u03b1M = 1.75 \u00b1 0.06. The irregular and spiral ICMFs are\nstatistically indistinguishable in spite of expected differences in galactic shear and metallicity.\nOur derived ICMFs are slightly top-heavy compared to\nsome previous studies, perhaps because of the generally\npoorer spatial resolution of the SDSS data; it is likely\nthat many of our more massive \"clusters\" are blends of\nadjacent smaller clusters. Nevertheless, this does not\naffect our conclusion on the similarity of the irregular\nand spiral ICMFs since these data were analyzed in the\nsame way and share the same systematic errors.\nWe also find a characteristic timescale of about 510 Myr for clusters to move away from or destroy their\nnatal gas and dust clouds.\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for detailed comments that led to a significantly improved paper.

Statistically, these two distributions are indistinguishable.\n\n\f16\n\nFig. 7.- Visual extinction versus age of young massive clusters in irregular (left) and spiral (right) galaxies. We see an apparent evolution\nin the extinction of clusters as they age. Clusters younger than 5 Myr always have at least a few tenths of a magnitude of local V -band\nextinction. Clusters with ages 5 Myr or older have a &50% chance of being relatively free (AV < 0.1 mag) of extinction. This 5-10 Myr\ntimescale is thus the characteristic time for massive clusters to destroy or move away from their natal dust clouds. Note that some of\nthe relatively high values of extinction at later ages are likely caused by our line-of-sight intercepting local, but unrelated, clouds in the\nhost galaxies. The concentration of clusters at particular ages is due to extremities of the tracks of model cluster evolution in color space,\nto which the color3 method concentrates clusters with relatively large photometric uncertainties by adjusting the amount of extinction.\nThus some of the scatter in the derived extinction is also likely to be due to a combination of photometric errors coupled with systematic\nuncertainties in the positions of the tracks of model clusters in color space. Nevertheless, the evolution of the mean cluster extinction does\nappear to show a real decrease to very small values over about 5-10 Myr.\n\n\f17\nTABLE 1\nProperties of the Galaxies Used in this Survey\nGalaxy\n\nR.A.\n\nDec.\n\nHubble Stage\n(Type)\n\n9.0 (SA(s)m)\n10.0 (Im)\n10.0 (Im(p))\n10.0 (IAB(s)m)\n10.0 (ImB)\n10.0 (ImB(sp))\n9.0 (SB/Sm(p))\n10.0 (ImB)\n10.0 (Im)\n10.0 (ImA)\n10.0 (Im)\n10.0 (Im)\n10.0 (ImB)\n\n(J2000.0)\n\nMB\n\nv\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nDistance\n(Mpc)\n\nNcluster\nM > 105 M\u2299\n\n-17.3\n-16.8\n-14.8\n-17.1\n-18.8\n-17.5\n-18.7\n-16.0\n-13.0\n-16.4\n-15.3\n-11.6\n-16.1\n\n699\n464\n415\n291\n422\n690\n646\n663\n249\n683\n312\n400\n426\n\n9.32\n6.19\n5.53\n2.98\n5.63\n9.20\n8.61\n8.84\n3.32\n9.11\n4.16\n5.33\n5.68\n\n5\n8\n7\n9\n55\n90\n65\n1\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1\n\n-17.0\n-17.7\n-20.8\n\n435\n715\n503\n\n5.80\n9.54\n6.71\n\n2\n33\n379\n\nIrregulars\nNGC 2552\nNGC 3738\nNGC 4190\nNGC 4214\nNGC 4449\nNGC 4485\nNGC 4656\nIC 3521\nUGC 6541\nUGC 7408\nDDO 165\nDDO 167\nDDO 168\n\n08h 19m 20.s 53\n11h 35m 48.s 79\n12h 13m 44.s 73\n12h 15m 39.s 17\n12h 28m 11.s 90\n12h 30m 31.s 13\n12h 43m 57.s 73\n12h 34m 39.s 50\n11h 33m 28.s 90\n12h 21m 15.s 01\n13h 06m 24.s 85\n13h 13m 22.s 73\n13h 14m 27.s 95\n\n+50\u25e6 00\u2032 34.\u2032\u2032 7\n+54\u25e6 31\u2032 26.\u2032\u2032 0\n+36\u25e6 38\u2032 02.\u2032\u2032 9\n+36\u25e6 19\u2032 36.\u2032\u2032 8\n+44\u25e6 05\u2032 39.\u2032\u2032 6\n+41\u25e6 42\u2032 04.\u2032\u2032 2\n+32\u25e6 10\u2032 05.\u2032\u2032 3\n+07\u25e6 09\u2032 37.\u2032\u2032 0\n+49\u25e6 14\u2032 14.\u2032\u2032 0\n+45\u25e6 48\u2032 40.\u2032\u2032 8\n+67\u25e6 42\u2032 25.\u2032\u2032 0\n+46\u25e6 19\u2032 13.\u2032\u2032 2\n+45\u25e6 55\u2032 08.\u2032\u2032 9\n\nNGC 4571\nNGC 4713\nNGC 5457\n\n12h 36m 56.s 37\n\n+14\u25e6 13\u2032 02.\u2032\u2032 5\n\n12h 49m 57.s 87\n14h 03m 12.s 59\n\n+05\u25e6 18\u2032 41.\u2032\u2032 1\n+54\u25e6 20\u2032 56.\u2032\u2032 7\n\nSpirals\n6.5 (SAd(r))\n7.0 (SABd(rs))\n6.0 (SABcd(rs))\n\nReferences.\n- Coordinates and radial velocities were taken from NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\n(NED), and morphologies are from RC3.\nDistances are from LEDA (Patureal et al. 2003) except for\nMa\u0131\u0301z-Alpell\u00e1niz, Cieza, & MacKenty (2002) (NGC 4214).
