This result strongly suggests that the\nitinerancy in both hole and electron channels is the essential factor for the occurrence of\nsuperconductivity in iron chalcogenide superconductors.\nKEYWORDS: iron chalcogenide, FeTe, Hall effect, thin films, two-band model\n\nIron-pnictide1) and iron-chalcogenide2) superconductors are interesting materials when\ncompared with cuprate superconductors. In both compounds, superconductivity is induced by\nchemical substitution to a parent antiferromagnet suggesting a possible common mechanism\nresulting in a similar phase diagram. However, the nature of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nstate is qualitatively different. Cuprates are characterized as single-band metals and become\nan insulator, while iron-based superconductors are characterized as multi-band metals,3\u20135)\nand exhibit metallic behavior even in the AFM state.6) Actually undoped parent compounds\nof iron-based superconductors are compensated metals, where both electrons and holes contribute to the electrical transport. Therefore, this difference should be carefully considered\nwhen discussing the phase diagram, and it is important to understand how electrons and\nholes contribute to the electrical transport and superconductivity.\nThe multi-band nature of iron-based superconductors has been predicted by several\nband calculations carried out for LaFeAsO,3) BaFe2 As2 ,7) and Fe(Se,Te).8) In LaFeAsO and\nBaFe2 As2 , superconductivity is induced by chemical substitution of elements with different\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: ichiro@criepi.denken.or.jp\n1/??\n\n\fJ.

Se and Te take the same valence state, and the band structures are quite\nsimilar to each other.8) Hall effect measurements are one of the powerful techniques to trace\nhow the electronic state changes from FeTe with Se substitution.13) In this letter, we report\non the detailed Hall-effect measurements in the parent compound FeTe thin films, and try to\napply two-band Drude picture to demonstrate an interplay of electrons and holes using resistivity and Hall coefficients data. Although the band calculation predicts the sufficient amount\nof electron and hole density in FeTe, difference of the magnitude of mobility is remarkable\nnot only in the paramagnetic (PM) but also in the AFM states, which suggests the absence\nof interplay between two types of carriers.\nThin film samples were prepared by pulsed-laser deposition using a stoichiometric FeTe\nsintered target.13, 14) We choose MgO(100) as a substrate following the results of substrate\nselection in the growth of Fe(Se0.5 Te0.5 ) thin films.15) A metal mask was used to make the\nfilm in a six-terminal shape. Three FeTe films with different thicknesses are compared in the\npresent study: The thickness of samples A, B, and C is 40, 400, and 165 nm, respectively. The\ncrystal structure is characterized by an x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM), and the charge transport is characterized by Physical Properties Measurement System\n(Quantum Design).\nFigure 1(a) shows x-ray diffractions of the three samples. Sample C shows almost perfect\nc-axis orientation, while the other two contain the (101)-oriented domains. In sample A,\nthe 101 reflection is far intense than the 00l reflections. In sample B the intensity of the 00l\nreflections becomes strong but still the portion of the (101)-oriented domains are not small. We\nshould note, however, that even in sample A high-resolution transmission microscopy (TEM)\nobservation demonstrates a highly c-axis oriented structure [Fig. 1(b)]. We can see a sharp\ninterface between MgO and FeTe similar to the case of Fe(Se0.5 Te0.5 ) films on MgO,15) but\nsimultaneously some deteriorated layer is observed at the surface probably due to oxidation\nduring long-time expose in the air. The calculated c-axis lengths from the 00l reflections are\n6.258 \u00c5, 6.300 \u00c5, and 6.285 \u00c5 for samples A, B, and C, respectively.\nSamples A and B exhibit higher resistivities than sample C does as shown in Fig. 1(c),\nprobably because of the admixture of the (101)-oriented domains. The difference is consistent\nwith that \u03c1 along the FeTe layer is slightly lower than that perpendicular to it. It should be\nnoted that \u03c1 of sample C almost equals to that of bulk single crystals ever reported,16) indi2/??\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nLetter\n\ncating that sample C exhibits an intrinsic in-plane electric transport. Trace of the tetragonalto-monoclinic structural phase transition is not observed in samples B and C. In bulk samples,\nresistivity exhibits a discontinuous jump at Ttm = 68 K,16, 17) but samples B and C exhibit\nonly a rounded peak in \u03c1 around T = 80 K followed by a rather smooth decrease to low\ntemperatures as reported.18, 19) However, except for the absence of sharp drop at Ttm , overall\ntemperature dependence of \u03c1 is similar between the films and bulk crystals. Thus, crossover\nfrom tetragonal to monoclinic phases is likely to take place, and hence, we safely assume that\nan AFM long-range order is present in samples B and C at low temperatures. In contrast to\nthem, \u03c1 shows a steep drop at T = 57 K in sample A, indicating the presence of a first-order\ntransition.\nAnother important feature is that sample A shows a steep drop of resistivity below 11 K.\nThis can be attributed to the onset of superconductivity, because a typical suppression of the\ntransition temperature (Tc ) with external magnetic field is observed as shown in the inset of\nFig 1(d). The superconductivity was less obvious immediately after the growth of films, but\nshowed up after two months, and then became unchanged. Thus, this superconductivity seems\nto be due to an aging effect discussed for Fe(Te,Se) polycrystalline samples.20\u201322) However,\nwe cannot exclude a possible epitaxial strain effect discussed by Han et al.,19) because the\nc-axis length is far shorter in sample A than in samples B and C. Whatever the reason is, our\ninterest is focused on how the appearance of superconductivity is related to the normal-state\nelectric transport.\nThe Hall effect is investigated in the same way as was performed to Fe(Se,Te) thin films.13)\nWe first measure the transverse resistivity by sweeping the magnetic field between -9 T \u2264\n\u03bc0 H \u2264 9 T applied normal to the film surface, and then extract an asymmetric component\nto determine the Hall resistivity \u03c1xy . Figures 2(a) - 2(c) show the field dependence of \u03c1xy at\ndifferent temperatures. We find that samples A and B show steep increase up to \u03bc0 H = 2 T,\nwhich is due to an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). \u03c1xy can be expressed as \u03c1xy = B*RH + \u03c1s ,\nwhere B is the magnetic flux density, and \u03c1s is the anomalous term of the Hall resistivity.\nOn the other hand, no trace of AHE is detected in sample C evoking that AHE is not a\nphenomenon intrinsic to FeTe. The inset of Fig. 2(d) shows B dependence of d\u03c1xy /dB. This\ngives a rough measure to determine which field range is appropriate for the linear fitting to\n\u03c1xy , and we determine to fit the data at 2 \u2264 \u03bc0 H \u2264 4 T. It should be noted that the degree of\nlinearity in high-field region is not significantly different among the three films, which indicates\nthat the effect of AHE is limited in the weak-field region.\nThe field-dependence of \u03c1xy at low temperatures shows contrasting results from\n3/??\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nLetter\n\nFe(Se0.5 Te0.5 ). In our previous study of Fe(Se0.5 Te0.5 ) thin films,13) \u03c1xy exhibits a strong\nnonlinearity to the field at low temperatures, which was considered as a strong evidence of\nthe collapse of the condition of compensated metals, i.e. electron density 6= hole density. Such\nbehavior is hardly observed in FeTe except for the data at limited temperature regions; one is\naround T = 40 - 70 K where the slope of \u03c1xy changes from positive to negative, and the other\nis T = 10 K for sample A only. There are two possible reasons for this strong suppression of\nnonlinearity. One is that electron density is equal to hole density, and the other is that the\nmobility of one-type carrier is far larger than that of the other carrier. We will discuss it later.\nTemperature dependence of RH is summarized in Fig. 2(d). It is surprising that all three\nfilms follow almost the same lines in the high-temperature region, which indicates that the\nmixture of the (101)-oriented domain does not give a strong influence to RH . The inset of\nFig. 2(d) demonstrates that at T = 300 K the slope of \u03c1xy is similar to each other in spite of the\ndifference of \u03c1s . The deviation from the high-temperature trend becomes obvious below 100 K.\nRH 's start to decrease rapidly, change sign from positive to negative, and then are roughly\nsaturated below 30 K. The value at the lowest temperature T = 10 K is -6.72 \u00d7 10\u221210 m3 /C,\n-2.38 \u00d7 10\u22129 m3 /C, and -2.71 \u00d7 10\u22129 m3 /C for samples A, B, and C, respectively. The values\nfor samples B and C are roughly consistent with the recently reported numbers in bulk single\ncrystals.23)\nIn order to obtain further insight to the behavior of electrons and holes, it is useful\nto evaluate the mobility of carriers. However, it is unrealistic to directly deal with the five\nconduction bands of FeTe. We thus adopted a reduced two-band model containing one electron\nband and one hole band. In the two-band Drude model, resistivity and Hall coefficients can be\ndescribed as \u03c1 = 1/e(\u03bch nh + \u03bce ne ) and RH = (\u03bc2h nh \u2212 \u03bc2e ne )/e(\u03bch nh + \u03bce ne )2 , where \u03bch , \u03bce ,\nnh , and ne are hole mobility, electron mobility, hole density, and electron density, respectively.\nOnce nh and ne are given, we can calculate \u03bch and \u03bce . As was first predicted theoretically,24)\nand was later confirmed by neutron-diffraction studies,25, 26) FeTe has a bicollinear AFM\norder in low-temperature region. Therefore, we may apply the calculated carrier densities\nby Ma et al.,24) to our mobility estimation, in which nh (ne ) = 2.26 (2.38) \u00d7 1027 m\u22123\nare reported. Ma et al. also reported the carrier densities in the nonmagnetic state as nh\n= ne = 4.77 \u00d7 1027 m\u22123 (corresponding to a compensated metal),24) and at first glance\nthese values correspond to the high-temperature state. However, the presence of free localized\nspins above Ttm has been reported by magnetic susceptibility.27, 28) This means that the hightemperature region should be regarded as a Curie-Weiss type paramagnetic state, and hence\nthose calculated for the nonmagnetic state are likely overestimated. We thus need to apply\n4/??\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nLetter\n\nthe carrier densities calculated for the paramagnetic state, and use the following values nh\n(ne ) = 1.07 (1.26) \u00d7 1027 m\u22123 . which will appear elsewhere in near future.29)\nCalculated mobility is summarized in Figs. 3(a)-(c). At high-temperature (T \u2265 70 K), we\nplot \u03bch and \u03bce not only for the paramagnetic case but also the nonmagnetic case for comparison. It is easily seen that the \u03bce takes negative values in the whole temperature region in\ncommon to all the films, and thus this assumption looks unrealistic. In the paramagnetic case,\nwe obtained rather reasonable values of mobilities, and we discuss them hereafter. The electric\ntransport is dominated by holes at high temperatures; \u03bch exceeds \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121 for\nsamples A and B, while \u03bch of sample C reaches almost 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121 , which is the\nmain reason of the lower resistivity of sample C. \u03bce 's commonly show small values for three\nsamples; \u03bce 's are approximately half of \u03bch , indicating that the contribution of n-type carrier\nis strongly suppressed in the paramagnetic (PM) state. This is surprising because the band\ncalculation predict almost similar band mass for both the electron pocket around M point and\nthe hole pocket around \u0393 point.8, 24) We may infer that this large difference in the character\nof p- and n-type carriers is dependent on the more detailed structure of the Fermi surfaces,\nwhich will be clarified with ARPES and/or another methods.\nThe dominancy of holes is completely interchanged when the antiferromagnetic long-range\norder is evolved. Once FeTe goes into the AFM state, \u03bch starts decreasing and simultaneously\n\u03bce starts increasing. Strikingly, \u03bch is completely suppressed to zero in samples B and C, which\nindicates that the p type carrier has been almost localized. On the other hand, the evolution\nof \u03bce is remarkable, and its magnitude exceeds the value of \u03bch in the PM state. This large\nenhancement of \u03bce is the main reason of metallic, (d\u03c1/dT > 0), conduction in the AFM\nstate. Another important finding is that the suppression of \u03bch is less emphasized in sample\nA. The suppression of \u03bch actually occurs in sample A, but the minimum value of \u03bch remains\nat sufficiently high value as 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121 , which is comparable to \u03bce . Therefore, we\nmay expect in sample A that both electrons and holes coexist as itinerant carriers even in the\nAFM state.\nThe mobility analysis indicates that \u03bch remains finite in superconducting sample while\nit goes to almost zero in nonsuperconducting samples. In other words, sufficient itinerancy is\nnecessary for the occurrence of superconductivity in both electron and hole bands. This result\nprefers a scenario of pairing mechanism requiring an interband scattering between p- and\nn-type Fermi surfaces, and hence supports either s++ -wave or s\u00b1 -wave pairing states,4, 5, 30)\nwhile it may exclude the possibility of simple anisotropic s- and d-wave pairing state in which\ngap opens independently on each Fermi surface. One may claim that the strong suppression\n5/??\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nLetter\n\nof \u03bch to zero is just an artifact of the calculations. However, we have confirmed that a slight\nchange in the carrier density never alters the tendency that superconducting sample exhibits\nhigher hole mobility than that nonsuperconducting one does, and hence, the correlation of\nsuperconductivity with the itinerancy of holes and electrons seems to be robust. It should\nbe noted that our analysis taking only two bands into account does not loose generality for\nthe real five band transport. We should emphasize again that the present results discuss an\nextreme case where \u03bch is almost zero at low temperatures. In this case, we may safely conclude\nthat all holes are not mobile, and the qualitative discussion carried out before is still valid.\nIn conclusion, we measured the Hall effect for nonsuperconducting and superconducting\nFeTe thin films in detail. Temperature dependence of the Hall coefficients is analyzed by\na semiclassical two-band Drude model with the aid of calculated carrier density. The estimated mobility of n- and p-type carriers demonstrates a remarkable interchange across the\nantiferromagnetic transition. In the antiferromagnetic state, the mobility of p-type carriers of\nnonsuperconducting FeTe is suppressed to almost zero, while it remains finite in superconducting FeTe, which indicates that the necessity condition for the occurrence of superconductivity\nis that both electrons and holes remains itinerant.\nThe authors are grateful to Z. -Y.
