To cite\njust a few specific examples, impurities can improve the\nvoltage holdoff capability of insulating materials1 , they\nare critical for the optical properties of most laser materials and gemstones, and they turned out to be the secret\nof ancient Damascus steel blades.2\nStill, the physics of impurity systems is not well developed. The local crystallographic structure around impurities is unknown in most cases, although it is an essential piece of information to undestand their influence\non the physical properties of the host and to carry out\nab initio simulations of these materials. This situation is\ndue to the experimental and theoretical difficulties that\nare met to obtain microscopic information on impurity\nsystems. From the theoretical point of view, quantum\ncalculations of impurity systems require the use of large\nsupercells that have long not been computationally manageable. From the experimental point of view, impurity\nsystems can only be measured with methods which can\nselectively probe certain atomic species. Among such\nmethods, many of them, such as electronic paramagnetic\nresonance, give only indirect information on the position\nand nature of the atoms surrounding the impurity. Due\nto the advent of third-generation synchrotron radiation\nfacilities, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is now\nable to investigate impurities in solids.\nThe extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region of a XAS spectrum provides quantitative\n\ninformation about the short range organization around\nthe absorbing atom (coordination number, interatomic\ndistances). The x-ray absorption near-edge structure\n(XANES) region usually gives qualitative information\nabout the atomic arrangement up to the medium range\norder. XANES is sensitive to the electronic structure\n(bonding) and probes the empty states of solids. In the\ncase of dilute elements in single crystals, especially at\nthe K edge of 3d transition elements, collecting EXAFS\nspectra with a good signal-to-noise ratio is a difficult task,\nbecause the intensity of diffraction peaks becomes much\nlarger than the EXAFS signal. Taking the example of\nimpurities in corundum \u03b1-Al2 O3 ,3 good EXAFS spectra\ncould be collected for 10000 wt.ppm Cr3+ impurities, but\nthe usable energy range obtained for 1500 wt.ppm Fe3+\nimpurities was already quite limited, and the concentration of coloring impurities is often an order of magnitude\nlower than this. In such cases, XANES becomes a practicle and precious technique to get information about the\nlocal structure of the absorbing atom.4 However, the analyzis of the experimental XANES data is not straightforward because of the photoelectron multiple-scattering\nprocesses that occur in the near-edge region. Ab initio\nXANES simulations are then required to relate the experimental spectral features to the local geometry around\nthe aborbing atom.\nRecently, an efficient first-principle approach based on\nplane-wave pseudopotential formalism has been developed to calculate K-edge XANES spectra.5 Here we apply this method to the K-edge of substitutional paramagnetic impurities in aluminum oxide. More precisely, we\ninvestigate the structural modifications of the corundum\n\n\f2\ncrystal structure induced by the presence of substitutional Ti3+ , Cr3+ or Fe3+ . This system is chosen because\ncorundum containing transition metal impurities is important for laser applications and as gemstones. Colorless\ncorundum (\u03b1-Al2 O3 ) becomes red ruby, pink sapphire, or\nyellow sapphire when a small amount of Cr3+ , Ti3+ , or\nFe3+ ions substitute for Al3+ ions, respectively.6,7 The\ncolor of blue sapphire is due to the presence of (Fe-Ti)\npairs in \u03b1-Al2 O3 .\nFor this investigation, polarized XANES spectra are\nmeasured and calculated. Corundum belongs to the trigonal Bravais lattice, the optical axis being parallel to the\n[111] direction of the trigonal unit cell (i.e. to the c-axis\nof the hexagonal cell). Corundum is then a dichroic compound in the electric dipole approximation. The dichroic\nsignal is a direct signature of the departure of the impurity site from octahedral symmetry.3 XANES calculations are performed from structural models resulting\nfrom ab initio energy minimization calculations. The\nagreement of our experimental and theoretical spectra\ndemonstrates that precise structural information can be\nextracted from the anglular-dependent XANES spectra,\nprovided the electronic potential is accurately modelled.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nCrystallographic structure of \u03b1-Al2 O3 and\nsamples description\n\n6\n) space\nCorundum (\u03b1-Al2 O3 ) belongs to the R3\u0304c (D3d\ngroup.8 The trigonal unit cell contains two Al2 O3 formula\nunits. The atomic environment of aluminum is illustrated\nin Fig. 1. The atomic site of aluminum is a distorded octahedron with a 3 (C3 ) local point symmetry. The AlO6\noctahedron is characterized by two different Al-O interatomic distances. If we consider that the absorbing atom\nis denoted by Al in Fig. 1, the nearest three oxygen atoms\nare labeled O1 in Fig. 1. The farther three oxygen atoms,\nlabeled O2 , form a face shared by two octahedra along\nthe three-fold symmetry axis. Beyond the coordination\nshell of aluminum, the next two neighbors are aluminum\natoms, labeled Al1 and Al2 in Fig. 1, and are relative\nto face-shared octahedra and edge-shared octahedra, respectively.\nThree synthetic single crystals of doped \u03b1-Al2 O3 (obtained by the Verneuil process) are used for this study: a\nred ruby (\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ ), a blue sapphire (\u03b1-Al2 O3 :FeTi) and a pink sapphire (\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Ti3+ ). The impurity\nconcentration in each sample is given in table I. They are\nmeasured with the Cameca Microbeam electron microprobe at the CAMPARIS analytical facility of Paris. A\n30 kV acceleration with a 15 nA beam current, defocused\nto 10\u03bcm, is used. X-ray intensities are corrected for deadtime, background, and matrix effects using the Cameca\nZAF routine. The standards used are \u03b1-Al2 O3 , \u03b1-Cr2 O3 ,\n\u03b1-Fe2 O3 and TiO2 . The blue sapphire sample is chosen to represent the model compound of iron impurity\n\nFIG. 1: Aluminum atomic site in corundum. Left: the corundum structure is represented as a stacking of AlO6 octahedra\n(the trigonal cell and the three-fold symmetry axis are indicated). Right: zoom of the black-framed region of the left\npanel. The aluminum site with its O1 , O2 , Al1 and Al2 first\nfour neighbors are indicated.\n\nin corundum (\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Fe3+ ). It is indeed preferred to a\nyellow sapphire sample, that only contains iron impurities, because synthetic yellow sapphires are known to be\ninhomogeneous.9 Consequently, in this study, we assume\nthat the low concentration of titanium (750 wt.ppm)\ncompared to that of iron (1500 wt.ppm) does not affect\nthe site relaxation around iron.\nTABLE I: Impurity concentration (in wt.ppm) in the three\ndoped \u03b1-Al2 O3 samples.\nSamples\nCr (wt.ppm) Fe (wt.ppm) Ti (wt.ppm)\nRed ruby\n10000 (\u00b1 1000)\nBlue sapphire\n1500 (\u00b1 50) 750 (\u00b1 30)\nPink sapphire\n540 (\u00b1 30)\n\nThe samples are cylindrically shaped: 15 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness for the ruby sample, and 5 mm\ndiameter and 1 mm thickness for the sapphire samples.\nThey are cut so that the optical axis is in the plane of\nthe disk surface, and the [101\u0304] direction of the trigonal\ncell is orthogonal to the disk surface.\n\nB.\n\nX-ray absorption measurements\n\nX-ray absorption measurements are carried out at the\nEuropean Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) on the\nID12 beam line, which is dedicated to polarization dependent spectroscopies.10,11 The monochromatic x-ray beam\nis obtained through a double Si(111) crystal monochromator, with a resolution \u2206E/E \u2243 10\u22124 . The oriented\nsamples are placed on a rotating holder with the normal\nof the disk surface parallel to the x-ray wave vector and\nto the rotation axis. The fluorescence intensity is measured by eight detectors symmetrically set around the\n\n\f3\nx-ray beam.\nXANES spectra are recorded for several angles \u03b8 between the optical axis of the sample and the x-ray polarization vector. We note \u03c3k and \u03c3\u22a5 the absorption cross\nsection obtained with \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 , respectively.\nIn the electric dipole approximation, the isotropic signal is given by (\u03c3k + 2\u03c3\u22a5 )/3, and the dichroic signal is\ngiven by the difference \u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3\u22a5 . The measurement of\nx-ray absorption spectra of impurities in crystals is impeded by the presence of large diffraction peaks. In order\nto decrease the intensity of diffraction peaks and elastic\nscattering, V and Mn filters (50 \u03bcm width) are used for\nthe Cr K edge in ruby and the Fe K edge in blue sapphire, respectively. By so doing, the spectra recorded for\nthe two angles \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 are not affected by\ndiffraction peaks. On the contrary, no filter is available\nfor the Ti K edge and the absorption was measured for\n100 angles \u03b8 from 0 to 360\u25e6 . The \u03c3k and \u03c3\u22a5 spectra are\nreconstructed from this amount of data by using a Fourier\ndecomposition to remove the contribution of diffraction\npeaks to the spectra.\n\nC.\n\nCalculation methods\n\nThe starting point of any XANES ab initio calculation\nis a structural model. Two structural models are considered for each compound. The first one, called non-relaxed\nmodel, corresponds to the substitution of one aluminum\natom by one impurity Ti, Cr or Fe in the \u03b1-Al2 O3 , without relaxing its structure. The second one, called relaxed\nmodel, is the result of ab initio energy minimization calculation carried out on the non-relaxed model. This calculation is performed using Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics with simulated annealing12 as implemented in the\nCPMD code.13 The XANES calculations are then carried\nout within the scheme of the PARATEC code,14 using the\nformalism described in Ref.5 Both codes are based on the\ndensity functional theory (DFT) within the spin polarized local density approximation (LSDA), and use planewave basis set and norm-conserving Troullier-Martins\npseudopotentials15 in the Kleinman-Bylander form.16 In\nthe following, we give all the parameters used in both\nkinds of calculation.\n\n1.\n\nStructural model construction\n\nThe structural models are constructed from the lattice\nparameters and atomic positions resulting from a previous ab initio calculation, performed by Duan et al.17,18 in\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 . In Ref.17 , the trigonal unit cell parameters are\naR = 5.11 \u00c5 and \u03b1 = 55.41\u25e6, the aluminum atoms are\nin 4 c symmetry sites19 with x = 0.352 and the oxygen\natoms are in 6 e symmetry sites19 with x = 0.555. We\nverify by using CPMD that this corundum optimized structure obtained by Duan et al. corresponds to atomic forces\nless than 2.10\u22123 Ry/\u00c5. Since we use periodic bound-\n\nary conditions, we consider 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercells. The\nsupercells contain 80 atoms: 48 oxygen atoms, 31 aluminum atoms and 1 transition metal atom (Ti, Cr or Fe)\nin substitution for aluminum. With such large supercells, the interaction between two impurities (belonging\nto two neighboring cells) is negligible. These supercells\ndefine the non-relaxed models mentioned above. The relaxed models are obtained by minimization of the energy\nof the non-relaxed supercells. All atoms are allowed to\nrelax, while the lattice constants are fixed. The impurities considered in this study are known to be in a highspin state,20 therefore the spin multiplet imposed on the\ntrivalent impurities are S= 12 for Ti3+ ([Ar]4s0 3d1 ), S= 23\nfor Cr3+ ([Ar]4s0 3d3 ), and S= 25 for Fe3+ ([Ar]4s0 3d5 ).\nThe parametrization of the norm-conserving TroulliersMartins pseudopotentials is given in Table II. The wave\nfunctions and the charge density were expanded in plane\nwaves with cutoff of 80 Ry and 320 Ry, respectively. Since\nthe supercell is rather large, and since the systems are insulating materials, the Brillouin zone is only sampled at\nthe \u0393 point.\nTABLE II: Parametrization used for the generation of the\npseudopotentials.

The method uses periodic boundary conditions, plane-wave basis-set, pseudopotentials\nand reconstructs all-electron wave functions within the\nprojector augmented wave (PAW) framework.22 In order to allow the treatment of large supercells (hundreds\nof atoms), the scheme uses a recursion method to construct a Lanczos basis and then compute the cross section as a continued fraction,23,24 in the electric dipole\nand quadrupole approximations.25 Electric quadrupole\ntransitions are relevant for the pre-edge region, in particular at the K-edge of transition metals. The absorption cross section is calculated beyond the \"muffin-tin\"\napproximation, that is known to limit the applications\nof the multiple scattering theory traditionally used for\nXANES simulations.26,27,28\nXANES spectra are computed at the transition metal\nK edge for both relaxed and non-relaxed models of the\nthree compounds, using the 80-atom supercells described\nin the previous subsection. For the pseudopotentials construction, we again use the parametrization given in Ta-\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nStructural model analysis\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nFe\nCr\nTi\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n30\n\n40\n\nFIG. 2: Energy dependence of the \u03b3 parameters used for the\nconvolution of the XANES spectra at the Ti, Cr and Fe K\nedges in doped \u03b1-Al2 O3 . The zero in the energy scale refers\nto the highest occupied level in the corresponding structure.\n\nble II. In order to take into account the core-hole effects\nin the calculations, the Ti, Cr and Fe pseudopotentials\nare generated with only one 1s electron. The spin multiplet degeneracy is set by imposing the number of up and\ndown states given by the CPMD code. Convergence of the\nXANES theoretical spectra is reached for the following\nset of parameters: a 64 Ry energy cutoff and one k-point\nfor the self-consistent spin-polarized charge density calculation, and 32 k-points29 for the absorption cross section\ncalculation. An energy dependent broadening parameter\n\u03b3 is used in the continued fraction (see Ref.5,21 ) in order to account for the two main photoelectron damping\nmodes.30 This width \u03b3 corresponds through the timeenergy uncertainty relations to a lifetime of the photoelectron. At low energy, the lifetime of the photoelectron\nis only limited by the core-hole lifetime within the plasmon pole approximation. The parameter \u03b3 was then set\nto a constant, which corresponds to K level full width at\nhalf maximum given by Krause and Oliver.31 At higher\nenergy, the kinetic energy of the photoelectron is great\nenough so that it can interact with the electron gas of\nthe system. Its amplitude is damped, provoking a sharp\ndecrease in the lifetime. Therefore the \u03b3 parameter was\nset to rapidly increase, and then to have a smooth linear\nbehaviour. The \u03b3 energy-dependent parameters used in\nthis study are displayed in Fig. 2.\n\nIII.\n\nThe relaxed models of \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ and \u03b1Al2 O3 :Fe3+ are already described and discussed in a previous work.3 However, in order to compare with the relaxed model of \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Ti3+ , most of the results of Ref.3\nare recalled here.\nThe analysis of the relaxation can only be done by careful comparison of the relaxed and non-relaxed supercells.\nThis is achieved by comparing clusters that are built\nfrom the supercells using the method detailed in Ref.3\nThese clusters are centered on the impurity and contain\n66 atoms (5.2 \u00c5 radius). In order to avoid the influence\nof the impurity displacement in the relaxed model, we\ndefine the mass center \u03a9 of each cluster by calculating\n~ = P 1 P mi OM\n~ i , where O is the impurity posiO\u03a9\ni\ni mi\ntion, Mi refers to all the atoms within a given cluster\nexcept the impurity and mi is the mass of the atom i.\nFor each atom i around the impurity, we evaluate the\nnorm of the displacement vector, V~i ,\ni\ni\n|V~i |2 = (Xrelaxed\n\u2212 Xnon-relaxed\n)2\ni\ni\n2\n+ (Yrelaxed \u2212 Ynon-relaxed )\ni\ni\n)2 ,\n+ (Zrelaxed\n\u2212 Znon-relaxed\ni\ni\ni\nwhere\n(Xnon-relaxed\n, Ynon-relaxed\n, Znon-relaxed\n)\nand\ni\ni\ni\n(Xrelaxed, Yrelaxed , Zrelaxed) are the cartesian coordi~ i vector in the non-relaxed and relaxed\nnates of \u03a9M\nclusters, respectively.\nThe angular relaxation was\nalso determined.\nIt was defined by the quantity\n\u03b4\u03b8 = \u03b8non-relaxed \u2212 \u03b8relaxed , where \u03b8relaxed and \u03b8non-relaxed\n~ i directions and the C3\nare the angles between the \u03a9M\naxis in the relaxed and non-relaxed clusters, respectively.\nThe comparison of the relaxed and non-relaxed clusters\nleads to the following conclusions.\n0.4\n\n\u03b4\u03b8 = \u03b8non-relaxed- \u03b8relaxed (\u00b0)\n\n\u0393/2 (eV)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3+\n\n\u03b1-Al2O3:Ti\n\n-0.4\n0.4\n0\n\n\u03b1-Al2O3:Cr\n\nO\nAl\n\n-0.4\n\n3+\n\n0.4\n0\n\n\u03b1-Al2O3:Fe\n\n-0.4\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n3+\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nDistance from the impurity atomic site (\u00c5)\n\nThis section is organized as follows.

These bond lengths are compared with the experimental and calculated Al-O and Al-Al interatomic\ndistances in \u03b1-Al2 O3 and to the M-O and M-M distances in \u03b1-M2 O3 . It is worth noting that the distances indicated for\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 relative to Ref.18 are the M-O and M-Al distances in the non-relaxed models.\nCompound\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 (exp.8 )\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 (calc.18 )\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Ti3+ (this calc.)\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ (calc.3 )\n\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Fe3+ (calc.3 )\n\u03b1-Ti2 O3 (exp.8 )\n\u03b1-Cr2 O3 (exp.48 )\n\u03b1-Fe2 O3 (exp.48 )\n\ndAl\u2212O1\ndAl\u2212O1\ndTi\u2212O1\ndCr\u2212O1\ndFe\u2212O1\ndTi\u2212O1\ndCr\u2212O1\ndFe\u2212O1\n\nInteratomic distances (in \u00c5)\ncation-oxygen\ncation-cation\n=1.86\ndAl\u2212O2 =1.97\ndAl\u2212Al1 =2.65\ndAl\u2212Al2 =2.79\n=1.84\ndAl\u2212O2 =1.95\ndAl\u2212Al1 =2.62\ndAl\u2212Al2 =2.77\ndTi\u2212Al1 =2.72\ndTi\u2212Al2 =2.83\n=1.97\ndTi\u2212O2 =2.07\ndCr\u2212Al1 =2.64\ndCr\u2212Al2 =2.80\n=1.95\ndCr\u2212O2 =2.00\ndFe\u2212Al1 =2.72\ndFe\u2212Al2 =2.83\n=1.92\ndFe\u2212O2 =2.10\ndTi\u2212Ti2 =2.99\ndTi\u2212Ti1 =2.59\n=2.01\ndTi\u2212O2 =2.08\ndCr\u2212Cr2 =2.88\ndCr\u2212Cr1 =2.65\n=1.96\ndCr\u2212O2 =2.01\ndFe\u2212Fe2 =2.97\ndFe\u2212Fe1 =2.90\n=1.94\ndFe\u2212O2 =2.11\n\nNorm of the displacement vector (\u00c5)\n\n(M = Ti, Cr or Fe). The angular relaxation is found\nto be very small (i.e. less than 0.8 degrees). This is\nillustrated in Fig. 3, which gives \u03b4\u03b8 as a function of the\ndistance between the impurity and its neigboring atoms\nin the relaxed clusters.\nSecond, a displacement of the impurity from the initial\naluminum site is observed in the three relaxed models.\nThis displacement occurs along the C3 axis, but its absolute value depends on the impurity. Chromium is displaced by 0.03 \u00c5 towards Al1 atom, titanium is displaced\nby again 0.03 \u00c5 but in the opposite direction, and iron\nis further moved (0.09 \u00c5 towards Al1 atom). The small\ndisplacement of chromium is in agreement with various\nexperimental studies of the literature.32,33,34,35,36 The result for iron is consistent with an analysis of electronic\nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, that gives\na displacement of 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5.37\n\u03b1-Al2O3:Ti\n\n0.1\n\n3+\n\n0.05\n0\n\n3+\n\n\u03b1-Al2O3:Cr\n\nO\nAl\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n3+\n\n\u03b1-Al2O3:Fe\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nDistance from the impurity atomic site (\u00c5)\nFIG. 4: Radial relaxation around the paramagnetic impurities in doped \u03b1-Al2 O3 : norm of atomic displacement vectors\n(oxygen atoms in solid line with circles and aluminum atoms\nin dashed line with triangles) as a function of distance from\nthe impurity in the relaxed model.\n\nThird, an increase of distances within the coordination shell of the impurity is observed. This result is\n\nexpected since the ionic radii of Ti, Cr and Fe in octahedral site38 (rTi3+ = 0.670 \u00c5, rCr3+ = 0.615 \u00c5 and\nrFe3+ = 0.645 \u00c5) are all greater than the ionic radius\nof aluminum (rAl3+ = 0.535 \u00c5). The calculated M-O1\nand M-O2 bond lengths in doped \u03b1-Al2 O3 were found to\nbe close to M-O1 and M-O2 bond lengths in the corresponding metal oxides, \u03b1-M2 O3 (\u03b1-Ti2 O3 , \u03b1-Cr2 O3 and\n\u03b1-Fe2 O3 ). On the contrary, the distances M-Al1 and MAl2 were less affected by the relaxation process: they are\ncloser to Al-Al1 and Al-Al2 bond lengths in corundum\nthan the M-M1 and M-M2 distances in the corresponding\noxides \u03b1-M2 O3 . Tab.III gathers the M-O1 , M-O2 , M-Al1\nand M-Al2 distances in \u03b1-Al2 O3 :M3+ deduced from the\ncalculation, and compares them with the corresponding\ndistances in \u03b1-Al2 O3 , \u03b1-Ti2 O3 , \u03b1-Cr2 O3 and \u03b1-Fe2 O3 ,\nresulting from x-ray diffraction experiments. One can remark in Tab. III that the Ti-O1 and Ti-O2 bond lengths\nin \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Ti3+ (1.97 \u00c5 and 2.07 \u00c5) are quite similar to\nthose in \u03b1-Ti2 O3 (2.01 \u00c5 and 2.07 \u00c5). Besides, the TiAl1 and Ti-Al2 distances in \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Ti3+ (2.72 \u00c5 and\n2.83 \u00c5) are closer to the Al-Al1 and Al-Al2 distances\nin corundum (2.65 \u00c5 and 2.79 \u00c5) than to the Ti-Ti1\nand Ti-Ti2 distances in \u03b1-Ti2 O3 (2.59 \u00c5 and 2.99 \u00c5).\nOne can notice that the experimental distances Cr-Cr1\nin \u03b1-Cr2 O3 and Al-Al1 in \u03b1-Al2 O3 are both equal to\n2.64 \u00c5. Thus one expects that Cr-Al1 distance in ruby\n(\u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ ) should be around 2.64 \u00c5. The calculated\ndistances of \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ are slightly larger (+0.015 \u00c5)\nthan those determined from EXAFS measurements on\npowder samples,36 and in good agreement (+0.005 \u00c5)\nwith EXAFS measurements performed and on the same\nsingle crystal as the one used in the present study.3\nThey are also consistent with data extracted from optical spectroscopy.39 For \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Fe3+ , the calculated distances are in agreement with EXAFS experiments3 and\nwith EPR results.37\nFinally, the M-O and M-Al distances deduced from\nthe ab initio relaxation calculations suggest that the\nstructural relaxation around the transition metal impurities is quite local and mainly concern the coordination shell. This point is confirmed by the calculations of\n\n\f6\n\nB.\n\n2\n\nAbsorption (arbit. units)\n\nthe atomic displacements between the relaxed and nonrelaxed. Fig. 4 represents the norm |V~i | as a function of\nthe distance between the impurity and its neighbors in\nthe relaxed model. It clearly shows that the oxygen coordination shell absorbs almost the relaxation. The displacement of atoms farther than 2.5\u00c5 from the impurity\nis less than 0.035 \u00c5. Comparing the three compounds,\none also observes that the relaxation is slightly larger\naround titanium and iron than around chromium.\n\n(\u03c3//+2\u03c3\u22a5)/3\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nPre-edge\n\n0.05\n\n0.5\n\nCore-hole effects\n\nThe influence of the core-hole can be described by calculating a self-consistent potential around a core-hole or\nby solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation.40,41 For impurity\nsystems, solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation is probably\nbeyond the reach of available computer programs. Moreover, it was already observed that both methods give\nquite similar results.5 Therefore, we shall describe the\ninfluence of the core-hole by calculating a self-consistent\npotential in the presence of a 1s core-hole.\nCalculated spectra performed with or without the presence of a 1s core-hole on the chromium absorbing atom\nare compared in Fig. 5. It clearly appears that the corehole is needed to obtain a good agreement with the experimental curve. In particular, the intensity and the\nenergy positions of the features within the 6005-6017 eV\nenergy range are not well reproduced if the core-hole is\nnot taken into account in the calculation. We have noticed similar behaviors due to the presence of the corehole at the titanium and iron K-edges in \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Ti3+\nand \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Fe3+ , respectively.\nOn the other hand, the presence of the core-hole has a\nnon-negligible impact in the pre-edge region. This is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5, which represents the pre-edge\nregion (5985-5998 eV) of the Cr K edge in \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ .\nAn interpretation of this region in terms of group theory\nhas been detailed in Ref.42 In the pre-edge region both\nelectric dipole (1s \u2192 p) and quadrupole (1s \u2192 3d) transitions occur. Since the site of the impurity in doped \u03b1Al2 O3 is not centrosymmetric, the p states are present in\nthe pre-edge through p \u2212 d hybridization. electric dipole\n(1s \u2192 p) and quadrupole (1s \u2192 3d) transitions occur.\nSince the site of the impurity in doped \u03b1-Al2 O3 is not\ncentrosymmetric, the p states are present in the pre-edge\nthrough p\u2212d hybridization. The calculated curves shown\nin the inset of Fig. 5 are the sum of both contributions.\nFor the calculation of electric quadrupole transitions, the\ndirection of the wave vector of the photon beam, k, has to\nbe specified. In the experiments, the single crystals were\nplaced on the rotating holder so that the wave vector\nwas parallel to the [101\u0304] crystallographic direction. Consequently, the spectra (\u03c3k + 2\u03c3\u22a5 )/3 shown in Fig. 5 are\ncalculated with k//[101\u0304].43 The two features of the experimental pre-edge are reproduced with or without the 1s\ncore-hole (see inset of Fig. 5).

A similar energy shift due to the corehole was already observed for electric quadrupole transitions at the Ti K pre-edge in rutile.44 Unfortunately,\nhere the shift induced by the presence of the core-hole\nis not large enough to give a perfect agreement with experiment. This problem may be due to the limit of the\ndensity functional theory within LDA to model the core\nhole-electron interaction for empty d states of 3d transition metals. LDA+U calculations could possibly improve\nthe agreement in the pre-edge region. Indeed in Ref.45 ,\nthe authors show that LDA+U calculations performed on\nruby essentially affect the positions of Cr d level relative\nto the valence and the conduction band.\n\nC.\n\nComparison between experimental and\ncalculated XANES spectra\n\nFig. 6 compares experimental XANES data with the\ntheoretical spectra obtained with the relaxed models.\nThe (\u03c3k + 2\u03c3\u22a5 )/3 and \u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3\u22a5 signals are displayed at\nthe Ti K edge for the pink sapphire sample (Fig.6a), at\nthe Cr K edge for the ruby sample (Fig.6b) and at the\nFe K edge for the blue sapphire sample (Fig.6c).\nOne observes that the experimental spectra present\ncomparable overall shapes. The Fe K edge seems to be\nless resolved than the Ti and Cr K edges, probably due\nto the following two reasons: (i) the core-hole lifetime is\nshorter at the Fe K-edge (1.25 eV) than at the Cr Kedge (1.08 eV) and at the Ti K-edge (0.94 eV);31 (ii)\nthe instrumental resolution is estimated to 0.9 eV at the\nFe K-edge while it is 0.6-0.7 eV at both the Cr and Ti\nK-edges.

At least to a certain extent, these spectra could\nbe considered as the signature of a transition metal ion\nwith a +III oxydation state in six-fold coordinated environment. However it is here necessary to perform calculations to go farther in the XANES analysis.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 6 that a good agreement is obtained between experimental data and calculated spectra\ncarried out on the relaxed structural models. The agreement is especially good for ruby at the Cr K edge, where\nenergy positions and relative intensities of the various features are well reproduced. It should be emphasized that\nnot only the averaged (\u03c3k + 2\u03c3\u22a5 )/3 spectra are correctly\nreproduced, but also the dichroic signal, from which more\nprecise structural information could be extracted. Such\na good agreement with angular dependent spectra has\nbeen also obtained with the same calculation method: at\nthe Al K edge in corundum21 and at the Si K edge in\n\u03b1-quartz.5\nWe have seen in Sec. III A that the differences between the relaxed and non-relaxed structures are essentially concerned with the interatomic distances within\nthe coordination shell of the impurity. Therefore, it is\ninteresting to test the sensitivity of XANES to such subtle structural modifications. Fig. 7 compares \u03c3k and \u03c3\u22a5\nexperimental spectra with the corresponding calculated\nones performed from both non-relaxed and relaxed models. First of all, it is worth noting that the differences\nobserved between calculated spectra are small but not\nnegligible. For all compounds, peaks labeled g in \u03c3k and\nlabeled I and J in \u03c3\u22a5 are too strong in the non-relaxed\ncalculated spectra. Consequently, these features (all located at about 30 eV above the edge) are clearly correlated to the first interatomic distances around the impurity. The same conclusion can be made for the shoulders\nlabeled A and B in \u03c3\u22a5 and b in \u03c3k . Especially at the Cr\nK edge in \u03c3\u22a5 signal, one can see that the double-feature\n(D and E) is better reproduced by the relaxed calculation\nthan by the non-relaxed one.\nIn a previous study,3 the relaxed model was validated\nup to the second neighbors around the impurity by comparison with EXAFS measurements. Here, thanks to the\nvery good agreement obtained between experimental and\nrelaxed calculated XANES spectra, the relaxed structural\nmodel is again validated and this time to greater extent.\n\n7135\n\n7145\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n7155\n\n\u03c3\u22a5\n7125\n\n7135\n\n7145\n\n7155\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 7: Comparison between \u03c3k (left) and \u03c3\u22a5 (right) experimental data (thick solid line) and calculated spectra obtained\nwith both relaxed model (thin solid line) and non-relaxed\nmodel (dashed line): a) the Ti K edge in pink sapphire, \u03b1Al2 O3 :Ti3+ ; b) the Cr K edge in ruby, \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Cr3+ ; c) the\nFe K edge in blue sapphire, \u03b1-Al2 O3 :Fe-Ti.\n\nous theoretical structural models using the full-potential\npseudopotential self-consistent method of Ref.5 The good\nagreement obtained between experimental and calculated\nspectra permits the validation of the structural models.\nWe have also pointed out the importance of the electronic potential construction to carry this study to a suc-\n\n\f9\ncessful conclusion. These results opens new applications\nin XANES analysis, in particular for dilute samples for\nwhich good quality EXAFS measurements are difficult to\ncollect.\n\nInformatique Scientifique in Orsay, where all the calculations of this study were carried out.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to acknowledge the computational support of\nthe French Institut du D\u00e9veloppement et de Recherche en\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nH.
