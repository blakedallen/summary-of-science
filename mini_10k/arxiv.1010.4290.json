Large-volume neutrino observatories have successfully measured and confirmed the existence of neutrino\nmass [4]. Nevertheless, neutrinos make only a small contribution to the dark matter density,\nP\nm\u03bd\n< 0.006,\n(4)\n\u03a9\u03bd =\n93.14 eVh2\nP\nwhere m\u03bd < 0.28 eV and h is the dimensionless Hubble\nparameter [3, 5]. Furthermore, formation of large-scale\nstructure in the Universe constrains the neutrino component of the dark matter [6]. Simulations of structure\nformation require a significant nonrelativistic, or \"cold,\"\ndark matter density [7], which cannot arise from standard\nmodel neutrinos.\nA number of suitable dark matter candidates arise\nfrom theories that propose physics beyond the standard\nmodel. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [8]\nare the most studied class of such dark matter particles. In particular, many R-parity-conserving weak-scale\nsupersymmetric (SUSY) theories offer a natural dark\nmatter candidate in the form of the lightest superpartner [1, 9, 10], often a neutralino. Massive, electrically\nneutral, and stable, the lightest neutralino, \u03c7\u030301 , of many\nSUSY theories is an excellent WIMP candidate. SUSY\ntheories contain a vast space of unknown free parameters,\nwhich are constrained by requiring consistency with existing empirical particle physics and astrophysics knowledge. Popular techniques for additionally restricting the\n\n\u22121 \u22121\n\n10\n10\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\nAstrophysical evidence strongly suggests that matter\nconstitutes approximately one quarter of the energy density of the Universe. Baryons in stars and intergalactic\ngas account for only a small fraction of the matter density, while the majority of the Universe's matter is of an\nunknown composition, collectively termed dark matter\n(DM) due to its apparently nonluminous nature [1]. Observations of large-scale structure and supernovae, combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background, imply a total matter and energy density close or\nequal to the critical density [2]. In terms of the critical\ndensity, the matter and energy budget breaks down as\nfollows:\n\nEvent rate (kg keV d )\n\n10\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\nRecoil energy (keV)\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1. (color online). Expected differential event rates for\n5 GeV/c2 (top panel) and 100 GeV/c2 (bottom panel) WIMPs\nscattering from Ge (blue/solid) and Si (red/dashed) targets.\nAll event rate calculations are based on the standard halo\nmodel described in [14], for an arbitrarily chosen WIMPnucleon cross section of 1x10\u221241 cm2 . Each energy spectrum\ncuts off abruptly at a maximum recoil energy due to the assumed galactic escape velocity. We use the 544 km/s galactic\nescape velocity from [15], while all other halo parameters are\ntaken from [16], and the local WIMP density is assumed to\nbe 0.3 GeV/cm3 .\n\nextent of the free parameter space result in a lower bound\non the \u03c7\u030301 mass of \u223c40 GeV/c2 [11]. Efforts to explore\na wide range of SUSY free parameter space indicate\nthat \u03c7\u030301 masses as low as a few GeV/c2 can be accommodated [12]. Under some scenarios, a relatively light\nWIMP could resolve the apparent conflict between the\nDAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal and the null\nresults of other experiments [13].\nIf WIMPs are the dark matter, they form a spherical\ncloud (or halo) in which the luminous portions of the\nMilky Way are embedded, and will scatter very rarely off\nthe nuclei in terrestrial matter. Direct detection experiments seek to observe and measure the kinetic energy, in\nthe keV range, of the recoiling nuclei. The expected spectrum of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils decreases rapidly\nwith increasing recoil energy, with the mean recoil energy directly proportional to the reduced mass of the\nWIMP-nucleus system. Events with the lowest recoil energies are most numerous for all WIMP masses, and thus\ndirect detection experiments generally strive for low recoil energy thresholds. Sensitivity to low recoil energies\nis particularly crucial for experiments seeking to detect\nlight WIMPs. Figure 1 illustrates expected spectra of\nnuclear-recoil energies for two types of target nuclei for\ntwo WIMP masses.\nThe advantages of a low threshold must be weighed\nagainst the degradation of background rejection capability at low recoil energies. Furthermore, the intrinsic rates\nof some categories of background may also increase at low\n\n\f3\nenergies. Finally, special care is required to account for\nthe effects of non-zero energy resolution at energies near\nthe electronic-noise level.\nIn this work we describe a new analysis of data from\nthe Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment,\nwith special attention to events of low recoil energy. In\norder to access this low-energy parameter space, we forgo\nthe pulse-shape discrimination techniques used to reject\nnear-surface background events in previous CDMS analyses. In contrast to previous CDMS results, the signal\nregion of this analysis will be populated by a number\nof background events. We adopt an inclusive philosophy that maximizes the detection efficiency at low energy while limiting the rate of nonphysical sources of\nbackground, such as electronic noise. This low-threshold\nanalysis sacrifices some of the strengths of the CDMS experiment's traditional background discrimination methods for a chance to probe previously untested low-mass\nWIMP parameter space.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND TECHNIQUE\nA.\n\nApparatus\n\nThe data reported on here were recorded during the\nfinal exposure of the first six CDMS II detectors at the\nStanford Underground Facility (SUF) [17, 18]. The SUF\nsetup provided a high level of shielding against external\nsources of radiation. The SUF was a shallow site with\n\u223c17 meters water equivalent overburden, effectively stopping hadronic cosmic rays and reducing the muon flux by\na factor of 5. The remaining incident muons were tagged\nwith a high-efficiency, hermetic plastic scintillator muon\nveto, allowing offline rejection of muon-coincident detector interactions. The muon veto enclosed several layers\nof tightly packed passive shielding. A 15 cm-thick outer\nlead shield and 25 cm-thick outer polyethylene shield surrounded the detector cold volume to attenuate external\nphotons and degrade external neutrons, respectively. Inside the radiopure copper walls that delineated the innermost 20 mK cold volume, 1 cm of ancient lead and an\nadditional 11 kg of polyethylene surrounded the detector\nassembly, providing further shielding.\nIn the center of the apparatus six Z-sensitive\nIonization- and Phonon-mediated (ZIP) detectors [19]\nwere arranged in a vertical stack (\"tower\"), with adjacent detectors separated by 2.2 mm with no intervening\nmaterial. Table I indicates the detector names, materials,\nmasses and relative positions within the tower.\nEach detector has two ionization electrodes deposited\non its bottom surface; a circular inner electrode (\"qinner\") covering 85% of the physical area, and an annular outer electrode (\"q-outer\") which permits identification and rejection of events with energy depositions\nwithin the outer detector volume. Photolithographed\nonto the top side of each Ge (Si) detector were 4144\n(3552) Al and W superconducting Quasiparticle-trap-\n\nTABLE I. The first six CDMS II detectors are listed in order\nof their relative positions (from top to bottom) within the\ndetector tower, indicating each detector's name, material, and\nmass.\nName\n\nMaterial\n\nMass (grams)\n\nZ1\n\nGe\n\n230.5\n\nZ2\n\nGe\n\n227.6\n\nZ3\n\nGe\n\n219.3\n\nZ4\n\nSi\n\n104.6\n\nZ5\n\nGe\n\n219.3\n\nZ6\n\nSi\n\n104.6\n\nassisted Electrothermal-feedback Transition-edge sensors\n(QETs). The 1036 (888) QETs in a given Ge (Si) detector quadrant are electrically connected, resulting in four\nindividually read out phonon sensors whose shared borders orthogonally bisect the surface. By measuring timing and pulse height differences between the sensors, we\ncan reconstruct an event's position in the plane parallel to\nthe detector's top and bottom surfaces (\"xy-position\").\nFollowing amplification by a SQUID array [20] and\nroom temperature electronics, two copies of each detector's four phonon signals were generated at the hardware level. A band-pass filtered analog sum of one set\nof phonon signals (the \"triggering phonon energy\") was\ncompared to a low-level discriminator threshold. The\nresulting logical pulses were OR'ed across all six detectors to form the experimental trigger. The second set of\nphonon signals were individually digitized, subjected to\na software optimal filter, and summed to constitute the\n\"reconstructed phonon energy.\" The hardware band-pass\nfilter's poles were chosen to resemble the software filtering as closely as possible. The energy deposition used to\ntrigger the data acquisition system is therefore very similar to the energies evaluated in software during offline\nanalysis, but not exactly the same. The discriminator\nthresholds were carefully tuned to the lowest levels possible to ensure that the overall trigger rate of .1 Hz during\nWIMP search was dominated by true particle interactions, while simultaneously allowing occasional triggers\ndue to electronic-noise fluctuations.\n\nB.\n\nMeasurement technique\n\nEnergy deposited by recoils causes two types of signals in our detectors. Most of the energy is deposited\nas a spectrum of high frequency athermal phonons. In\naddition, electron-hole pairs are created. The average deposited energy per pair created is \u01eb=3.0 (3.8) eV for Ge\n(Si) [21] (see also Appendix C in [22] for a detailed discussion of \u01eb). To measure the ionization, the QET side of\nour detectors was held at ground, and a bias voltage be-\n\n\f4\ntween -3 V and -6 V was applied to the electrodes on the\nother detector side, causing drift of liberated electrons\n(holes) to the QET (electrode) side. Charge-sensitive\namplifiers with field-effect transistor front-ends amplified\nthe signals on the electrodes and enabled inference of\nthe \"ionization energy\" Q from the total liberated ionization. The total phonon signal is comprised of three\nparts: 1)phonons produced promptly by the recoil (\"primary phonons\"); 2)phonons produced by the drifting ionization (\"Neganov-Luke phonons\" or \"drift heat\" [23]);\nand 3)phonons produced when electrons and holes recombine, usually at the detector surfaces (\"recombination phonons\"). The QETs and their amplification system enabled deduction of the energy Ptotal from the total\nphonons. The \"recoil energy,\" Erecoil , is equal to the sum\nof the primary and recombination phonon energies, and\ncan be deduced by subtracting off the drift heat:\nErecoil = Ptotal \u2212\n\neV\nQ,\n\u01eb\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V is the absolute value of the bias voltage, and e\nis the charge of the proton.\nThe CDMS detectors use these two sensor technologies to discriminate nuclear recoils, produced by WIMP\ncandidates, from much more numerous electron recoils,\nproduced mostly by background photons. The detectors\nprovide a simultaneous measurement of ionization and\nphonons for each particle-interaction event within the\ntarget. The ratio of ionization to recoil energy (\"ionization yield\" Y \u2261 Q/Erecoil) is higher for electron recoils than for nuclear recoils, and provides near-perfect\nevent-by-event discrimination for recoil energies in excess of 10 keV. However, the ionization yield is broadened\nby electronic noise for recoil energies lower than 10 keV,\nand discrimination power is lost for recoil energies below\nabout 2 keV.\nThe energy scale for Q and Erecoil was calibrated by\nelectron recoils caused by gamma-ray sources. The resulting ionization yield for electron recoils is (on average) equal to unity by construction. However, nuclear recoils cause less ionization, and generally follow the theory\nby Lindhard et al. [24]. Nuclear recoils from a neutron\nsource allowed determination of the energy dependence\nof their ionization yield, which smoothly increases from\n\u223c0.2 at Erecoil =2 keV to \u223c0.4 at 100 keV.\nThe ionization yield for nuclear recoils with recoil energies less than 2 keV is difficult to measure directly with\nZIP detectors. However, measurements using Ge detectors have been performed for energies as low as \u223c0.25 keV\n(see Fig. 3 in Appendix III in [25] for example), and\nagree well with Lindhard et al.'s model. We therefore\nextrapolate via a power law from 2 keV to lower energies such that the ionization yield is zero at 0 keV. The\nextrapolation is needed only to estimate the energy dependence of a few detection efficiencies for the lowestenergy nuclear recoils. At these low energies, the recoil\nenergy is less than (but nearly equal to) Ptotal , and the\nextrapolation is used to estimate recoil energy from Ptotal\n\nvia a small correction. Any uncertainty related to this\nsmall correction is therefore small as well. Alternative\nextrapolation methods have been used to test the effect\nthat uncertainty in the ionization yield for low-energy\nnuclear recoils might have on our ability to detect light\nWIMPs. We have determined that any systematic uncertainty introduced by our particular choice is small compared to the other sources of uncertainty discussed in\nSection IV D.\nAs discussed earlier, in this paper we extend the lowest\nrecoil energies to the 1 keV (2 keV) range for Ge (Si) targets. Nuclear recoils with such low energies will appear to\ndeposit very small ionization energy, in the tenths of keV.\nAlthough earlier CDMS analyses implemented minimum\nrequirements on the ionization energy, in this analysis\nwe have avoided any minimum requirement on Q. We\nemphasize that our hardware trigger used only the total\nphonon energy, which slightly exceeds the recoil energy\nfor nuclear recoils.\n\nC.\n\nRecoil-energy estimators\n\nOne way to estimate the recoil energy is with both\nmeasured Ptotal and measured Q used in Eq. 5 on an\nevent-by-event basis. This method incorporates errors\non both these measured quantities into the estimate of\nErecoil , and introduces significant correlations between\nErecoil and the ionization yield. This is the traditional\nCDMS method for estimating recoil energy because it is\naccurate even if it is not known whether an event is an\nelectron or nuclear recoil. The analysis cuts and their\nefficiencies (described in Section III B) use this event-byevent recoil-energy estimate when needed. We refer to\nthis estimate as the \"Q-corrected\" recoil energy to distinguish it from an alternative method discussed below.\nThroughout this paper, the recoil energy is always Qcorrected unless otherwise stated.\nThe recoil energy can also be estimated from Ptotal\nalone by scaling it to reflect the average ionization yield\nresponse measured from calibration samples. For example, since the ionization yield for electron recoils is on\naverage equal to one, the ionization energy for electron\nrecoils is on average equal to the recoil energy itself. Replacing Q by Erecoil in Eq. 5 yields Erecoil equal to onehalf (one-third) of Ptotal for Ge ZIP detectors operated\nwith a -3 V (-6 V) bias voltage. We refer to this estimate\nas the recoil energy corrected by electron-recoil ionization yield, or \"YER -corrected\" recoil energy. Due to its\nsuperior spectral resolution, it is particularly useful when\nstudying ZIP-detector response to x-ray and gamma-ray\nsources (see Fig. 6 for example).\nA similar recoil-energy estimate can be made for nuclear recoils. The reduced drift heat associated with\nnuclear recoils is energy dependent, and can be subtracted according to the mean ionization yield measured\nfrom 252 Cf calibrations (dashed line in Fig. 4 for example). The resulting recoil-energy estimator has the\n\n\f5\nadvantage of including electronic noise from only the\nphonon channel. We refer to this estimate as the recoil energy corrected by nuclear-recoil ionization yield,\nor \"YNR -corrected\" recoil energy. Discussed in more detail in Section III A, the hardware and software energy\nthresholds employed in this analysis depend solely on the\ntotal phonon signal. The associated threshold efficiencies (see Figs. 2 and 3, and Table II for example) for\ndetecting nuclear recoils are therefore functions of the\nYNR -corrected recoil energy.\n\nD.\n\nData samples\n\nThe first tower of CDMS II ZIPs was commissioned at\nthe SUF in the second half of 2001, and WIMP-search\ndata were recorded between December 2001 and June\n2002. Collectively termed \"Run 21,\" the WIMP search\nwas split into two distinct operational periods. The Ge\n(Si) detectors were initially operated with a -3 V (-4 V)\nbias voltage for 94 days between December 2001 and\nApril 2002, yielding just over 66 live days (henceforth\nreferred to as the \"3V data\"). These data were originally analyzed with a 5 keV analysis threshold, and the\nresulting exclusion limit on the spin-independent WIMPnucleon cross section is still one of the strongest constraints on low-mass WIMPs [17]. An additional 52 live\ndays of previously unpublished data were recorded over a\nperiod of 74 days between April and June 2002. In an attempt to reduce the surface-event background, we experimented with a -6 V bias voltage during this latter part\nof the run (henceforth referred to as the \"6V data\"). Although the larger bias voltage improved charge collection\nfor events near the detector surfaces, it also degraded the\nphonon pulse rise-time information used to reject surface\nevents. Overall, the rate of surface events leaking into the\nsignal region following a surface-event rejection analysis\nwas slightly greater for the 6V data. CDMS ZIP detectors have since been operated with the lower bias voltage\nsettings. In this paper we analyze data from both charge\nbias runs.\nA mixture of WIMP-search and calibration data was\nrecorded during Run 21. Detector response to electron recoils was tested by introducing a 60 Co gammaray source just inside the outer lead shielding. Three\ngamma-ray calibrations were performed for each voltage bias. Relatively short exposures conducted before\nrecording any WIMP-search data were followed by more\nextensive exposures midway through and after WIMPsearch runs. These data were primarily used for an eventby-event correction of the phonon signals for observed\nposition- and energy-dependent response functions (\"position correction\"). The xy-position information available from the modularity of the phonon sensors was used\nto correct variations in the reconstructed optimal-filter\npulse height due to variation in pulse shape with event\nposition, yielding improved phonon energy resolution.\nWith part of the outer polyethylene shielding removed,\n\nthe detectors were also exposed to a 252 Cf neutron source\nto calibrate their response to nuclear recoils. Neutron\ncalibrations were performed at the beginning and end of\nthe WIMP searches for each bias voltage. The ionization yield distributions obtained from these data helped\ndefine the nuclear-recoil signal region that WIMPs are\nexpected to populate. Nuclear-recoil detection efficiencies were estimated from these data as well.\nAlthough the hardware thresholds were tuned to occasionally trigger on electronic noise, the rate was far\ntoo low for proper characterization of the distribution\nof subthreshold noise pulses, and for estimates of nearthreshold efficiencies. To understand the near-threshold\nphenomena, samples of detector performance without the\ntrigger bias (\"nontriggered data\") are critically important. During Run 21, nontriggered data were obtained\nby invoking a randomly generated software trigger, resulting in a periodic sampling of the electronic-noise environment. These events constitute \u223c5% of all triggers,\nand can be considered a third type of calibration data.\nDue to the low rate of true particle interactions in the\ndetectors, randomly triggered events usually consisted\nof only noise fluctuations, with a very low probability\nof measuring a non-zero energy in any of the detectors'\nsensors. While useful for determining daily noise levels,\nthe randomly triggered data are inadequate for efficiency\nestimates since so few have energies near the detector\nthresholds. Furthermore, due to a timing artifact associated with the implementation of the random trigger,\nthese data were plagued by a low rate of unrepresentative noise traces. When reconstructed, the problematic\ntraces contribute non-Gaussian tails to each detector's\nunderlying electronic-noise distribution. Consequently,\nif the randomly triggered noise distributions are scaled\nto an exposure equivalent to the WIMP-search data and\nthen subjected to the WIMP-search cuts, the resulting\nrate of noise pulses in the signal region is grossly overestimated. We therefore made no use of nontriggered data\nfor characterizing resolutions and efficiencies.\nFortunately, an alternate sample of data that avoids\nthe trigger bias was acquired during normal, triggered\nreadout. Although most triggers were associated with\nan energy deposition in a single detector, traces for all\nsix detectors were recorded and analyzed. Data from the\ndetectors that did not trigger (\"other-detector triggers\")\nprovide a fair and representative sample of each detector's subthreshold noise distribution. Provided the noise\ndistribution is constructed from events where the triggering detector was not an adjacent detector, non-Gaussian\ntails are avoided. Events for which the triggering detector\nwas either directly above or below often contained small\nenergy depositions due to true multiple-detector interactions. This class of events includes a sampling of recoil\nenergies up to and exceeding the detector trigger thresholds, providing events with which to probe near-threshold\nbehavior. Some of these had energies exceeding their detector's trigger threshold and are not truly nontriggered\nevents, but rather events with a delayed trigger that oc-\n\n\f6\n1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\n\n3\n\nTrigger efficiency\n\nCounts / 0.25 keV\n\n10\n\n0.25\n10\n\nTABLE II.

For this detector the hardware trigger is\n100% efficient for energies above \u223c3 keV.\n\ncurred during a readout instigated by another detector.\nA logical-pulse-based post-trigger history of when these\ndelayed triggers occurred was recorded for each detector and event, and is the basis of the hardware trigger\nefficiency estimates detailed in the next section.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nNoise and thresholds\n\nTo be considered viable WIMP candidates, events were\nrequired to exceed hardware and software thresholds in\nphonon energy. We used data from other-detector triggers to measure the corresponding detection efficiencies\nas a function of reconstructed phonon energy. Since the\ntriggering phonon energy was slightly different from its\noffline reconstructed counterpart, the hardware threshold efficiencies as a function of the latter are not simple\nstep functions. To characterize the hardware threshold\nefficiencies, we first evaluate the reconstructed phonon\nenergy in the 50 \u03bcs following the time of each otherdetector trigger. Generally these reconstructed phonon\nenergies are Gaussian distributions centered at zero energy, consistent with electronic noise (\"noise cores\"). Oc-\n\nSoftware (keV)\n\ncasionally nonzero energies were reconstructed, augmenting each noise core with an approximately uniform distribution extending to higher energies. Sometimes the\npresence of a logical pulse from the low-level discriminator threshold was recorded in the post-trigger history of\nan other-detector trigger. We used events with logicalpulse presence to obtain the distribution in reconstructed\nphonon energy of successful triggers, and then divided by\nthe distribution of all (unsuccessful and successful) triggers to characterize the hardware threshold efficiency, as\nillustrated for one Ge detector in Fig. 2.\nA reconstructed phonon energy threshold (\"software\nthreshold\") was applied based upon the essentially Gaussian behavior of the reconstructed phonon energy. A\nGaussian fit to the noise core of each day's randomly triggered events was performed, and we required that events\nexceed a threshold of 6\u03c3 above the mean (for that day) in\nreconstructed phonon energy to be considered a WIMP\ncandidate. The 6\u03c3 thresholds for the Z2 and Z3 3V data\nwere the most stable, varying by less than 5% from day\nto day, while those for the Z1 data were the least stable, varying by as much as 50%. The software threshold\nefficiencies were calculated using the same method employed for the hardware trigger efficiency estimates described above, and differ from step functions because of\ntime variations in the Gaussian fit parameters. Table II\nsummarizes the average hardware and software phonon\nenergy thresholds.\nThe topmost Ge detector (Z1) is not included in Table II because it was rejected as a low-threshold detector.\nZ1 suffered from particularly strong dependence of pulse\nheight on xy-position for which the gamma calibration\nposition correction was unable to fully compensate. The\ncorrected energy resolution and associated 6\u03c3 thresholds\nare three to four times larger than those of the other Ge\ndetectors, yielding not only a larger analysis threshold,\nbut also causing the ionization yield-based discrimination to break down at a higher energy.

(color online). Fits to binned estimates of the hardware (orange/light solid) and software (blue/dashed) phonon\nenergy threshold efficiencies are multiplied, yielding the combined threshold efficiencies (black/dark solid) for typical Ge\n(top panel, Z5 6V data) and Si (bottom panel, Z4 3V data)\ndetectors as a function of YNR -corrected recoil energy.\n\nlow-mass WIMP sensitivity is critically dependent on its\ndetection threshold, data from Z1 would contribute very\nlittle to the reach of this analysis while allowing a disproportionate number of background events to leak into the\nsignal region. Z1 was only used to veto multiply scattering events.\nEach detector's final threshold efficiency is a product\nof its hardware and software threshold efficiencies. As\na function of reconstructed phonon energy, the software\nthreshold efficiencies nearly resemble step functions, rising to 100% more quickly and at lower energies than the\nhardware efficiencies. Consequently, the combined efficiencies differ from the hardware trigger efficiencies only\nfor very low energies. Figure 3 illustrates the combined\nefficiency for typical Ge and Si detectors. For all but one\ndetector the combined thresholds at 50% efficiency are\nequal to the hardware thresholds listed in Table II. During one week of the 3V data run, Z4's phonon noise was\nabnormally high, causing an extended period of higher\nsoftware thresholds. The effect on the software and combined efficiencies is shown in Fig. 3. The resulting combined threshold of 1.9\u00b10.1 keV is the largest among the\naccepted low-threshold detectors.\n\nB.\n\nAnalysis cuts and efficiencies\n\nWIMP candidates were required to pass a variety of\nstringent data-quality cuts. Events for which any part\nof the data record was incomplete or inconsistent were\nexcluded. Excessively noisy traces as well as traces with\nmultiple pulses (\"pileup\") were rejected based on the performance of the optimal-filter fits to the ionization sig-\n\nnals. Fits with unusually large \u03c72 values were removed\nfrom consideration. Noisy traces and pileup were further\nsuppressed by requiring the variances of the phonon and\nionization traces' prepulse baselines to be within 5\u03c3 of\nthe average behavior for randomly triggered noise traces.\nTogether, the data-quality cuts exhibit no energy dependence, and have a combined WIMP detection efficiency\nof \u223c99%. This applies for each detector type and for\nboth the 3V and 6V data.\nIf this analysis were restricted to recoil energies greater\nthan 2 keV, the above data-quality cuts would be sufficient. Throughout the 6V data run, however, the second Ge detector (Z2) was subject to intermittent periods of high trigger rates (\"event bursts\") due to sub2 keV pulses. Many followed cryogenic and detector servicing periods during which detector temperatures were\nelevated. Consequently, we conclude that these event\nbursts were not due to physical recoils in the detector,\nand were considered periods of poor data quality. Close\nexamination of the phonon traces for these events revealed elevated prepulse baselines with nominal variability, allowing them to pass the standard data-quality cut\ndescribed above. Discrimination parameters based on\nthe traces' average prepulse baselines were developed to\ncut the event bursts. Application of the cut reduces Z2's\n6V WIMP search from 52 days to 20 days, while reducing the corresponding number of WIMP candidates by a\nfactor of \u223c30. Despite being isolated to a single detector and less than half of the WIMP-search data, without\nthis cut the burst events would be the dominant source\nof background invading the signal region.\nA fiducial-volume cut based on the ionization signals\nrejects recoils that occurred near detector edges. The qinner signal estimates an event's ionization energy, while\nthe q-outer signal is required to be consistent with noise.\nCrosstalk between the inner and outer electrodes adds a\nsmall contribution to the q-outer signal proportional to\nthe q-inner pulse amplitude. To model this dependence,\nthe q-outer noise levels were parametrized as a function\nof q-inner energy, yielding 2\u03c3 q-outer \"noise bands\" designed to accept 95.5% of events within the fiducial volume. Phonon sensors of the adjacent detector also induced signals in the electrodes, initially causing a loss\nof otherwise viable events. To retain these events, the\nfiducial-volume cut was modified to reject only events\nthat exceed their noise band's upper limit, increasing the\ncut's expected acceptance to 97.7%. Combining the acceptance with the physical coverage of the q-inner electrode yields an expected fiducial volume of \u223c83% of the\ngross detector mass. We measured the efficiency of the\nfiducial-volume cut for recoil energies between 4 keV and\n100 keV with nuclear-recoil calibration data from 252 Cf\nexposures. The average efficiency agrees well with physical expectation, varying between \u223c81% (Z4 3V data) and\n\u223c83% (Z2 3V data). Over the measurable energy range,\nthe efficiency of the cut exhibits a weak energy dependence, generally decreasing with increasing recoil energy.\nThe Z4 6V data are the most extreme, where the effi-\n\n\f8\n1.2\n1\n0.8\nIonization yield\n\nciency smoothly decreases from \u223c84% at 4 keV to \u223c79%\nat 100 keV. For recoil energies less than 4 keV, a nuclearrecoil event's q-inner and q-outer signals are difficult to\ndistinguish from electronic noise, and the fiducial-volume\ncut is unable to differentiate events within the fiducial\nvolume from those that occurred near a detector's outer\nedge. Due to increased acceptance, the efficiency of the\nfiducial-volume cut should therefore increase rapidly as\nthe recoil energy decreases toward 0 keV. Since we were\nunable to measure this low-energy behavior, we made the\nconservative choice to linearly extrapolate the efficiency\nfor recoil energies less than 4 keV to match the efficiency\nmeasured at 4 keV.\nThe energy deposited by a WIMP in one of our detectors would be so localized and infrequent that only events\ncaused by backgrounds will cause significant energy depositions in two or more detectors simultaneously. We\ntherefore impose a \"single-scatter\" criterion, requiring\nsignal events to have had a significant energy deposition\nin no more than one detector. Since the phonon signal\nprovides the most sensitive indicator for a particle interaction in our detectors, we based the single-scatter cut\non the 6\u03c3 software thresholds described above and in Table II. An event is considered a single scatter if only one\ndetector has a reconstructed phonon energy exceeding its\nsoftware threshold. With an experimental trigger rate of\n.1 Hz, the probability of more than one pulse occurring\nwithin our .2 ms digitization time is negligible. The efficiency of the single-scatter cut is therefore nearly 100%,\nwith the near-threshold behavior taken into account by\nthe software threshold efficiency described above and in\nFig. 3.\nCandidate events must occur when there is no activity in the muon veto. A time history of muon veto activity (\"veto hits\") was recorded for each ZIP-triggered\nevent at an average rate of \u223c5 kHz. This rate far exceeds\nthe true rate of incident muons. Due to large and awkward counter geometries, many of the plastic scintillator\ncounters had regions with poor light collection. To ensure efficient tagging of muons passing through these regions, the photomultiplier tubes monitoring each counter\nwere operated at very high gains, causing regions with\nsuperior light collection (particularly near the photomultiplier tubes) to be partially sensitive to environmental\ngamma radiation. We achieved a muon tagging efficiency\nof >99.9% by rejecting a relatively high rate of ZIP detector interactions that were accidentally coincident with\ngamma rays registering as veto hits. An event is vetoed\nif there were any veto hits in the 50 \u03bcs to 80 \u03bcs preceding the triggering phonon pulse, allowing for a significant\ndifference in veto and phonon signal arrival times. The\nveto signals were effectively instantaneous relative to the\nmore slowly rising phonon pulses. The longer delay was\nassigned to events with recoil energies .3.5 keV, allowing smaller phonon pulses sufficient time to rise past the\nhardware trigger thresholds. WIMP detection efficiency\nis lost due to veto hits from gamma-ray activity.

Unvetoed single scatters passing the fiducial-volume and dataquality cuts are displayed for events consistent with the\nnuclear-recoil criterion (orange/light dots), and some that are\nnot (black/dark dots). A substantial gamma-ray flux from the\n252\nCf source populates the \"electron-recoil band\" near an ionization yield of 1. Two lines at \u223c10.4 keV and \u223c66.7 keV resulting from decays of Ge isotopes can be distinguished among\nthe electron-recoil events. As described in Section III C, the\nlow number of events above the nuclear-recoil band between\n2 keV and 6 keV recoil energy qualitatively demonstrates that\nchanneling does not significantly diminish this experiment's\nefficiency for detecting low-mass WIMPs.\n\napplication of the veto cut ranges from \u223c67% to \u223c78%.\nThe final selection criterion requires a candidate event\nto have an ionization yield consistent with being a nuclear recoil, thereby discriminating against the otherwise\noverwhelming rate of electron recoils. Several short exposures to the fission neutrons from a 252 Cf source provided sufficient nuclear-recoil events to parametrize each\ndetector's ionization yield response as a function of recoil energy. When binned according to recoil energy, a\ndetector's ionization yield distribution for nuclear recoils\nis well described by a Gaussian for energies as low as\n2 keV.

The electron-recoil energy scale\nwas initially calibrated with 662 keV gamma rays from a\n137\nCs source as part of a series of short diagnostic and debugging runs conducted at the very beginning of Run 21.\nThe gamma rays emitted by 137 Cs are lower in energy\nrelative to the &1 MeV gamma rays emitted by 60 Co,\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n10\nRecoil energy (keV) [Y \u2212corrected]\n\n100\n\nER\n\nFIG. 6.

Three peaks due\nto internal decays of unstable Ge isotopes are clearly visible\nat 1.3 keV, 10.4 keV and 66.7 keV.\n\nallowing easier calibration of the Si detectors for which\nsuch energetic photons are only partially contained.\nEach Ge detector's electron-recoil energy scale was\nconfirmed and monitored using three distinct energy\npeaks that conveniently span our analysis energy range.\nBoth 68 Ge and 71 Ge are unstable isotopes; 68 Ge is produced by cosmic rays, while 71 Ge by thermal neutron\ncapture. The former is long lived with a half-life of \u223c271\ndays and was primarily produced during detector construction and testing at sea level, while the latter is short\nlived with a half-life of 11.43 days and was primarily produced during exposure to the 252 Cf source [26]. Both isotopes typically decay through electron capture followed\nby emission of x-rays or Auger-electrons, of 10.4 keV for\nK-capture (\u223c90%) or 1.3 keV for L-capture (\u223c10%). We\nmeasured the ratio of L- to K-captures to be 0.122\u00b10.009,\nin good agreement with the ratio of 0.12 listed in [26].\nThe cosmogenically-induced meta-stable 73m Ge state decays through successive emission of 53.4 keV and 13.3 keV\nphotons, resulting in a 66.7 keV peak at the upper end\nof our energy range. The spectrum for an example Ge\ndetector shown in Fig. 6 clearly shows the three peaks\nfrom electron recoils induced by the above processes. To\nimprove spectral resolution, Fig. 6 is plotted as a function of YER -corrected recoil energy. A similar spectrum\nwith corresponding features can be constructed from the\nionization signal as well.\nThe Ge lines allowed measurement of the Ge phonon\nand ionization energy resolutions across our full analysis energy range. The fractional energy resolutions for\nelectron recoils vary from 8.8% (Z5 6V phonon channel) to 26.0% (Z3 3V ionization channel) at 1 keV, and\nfrom 2.0% (Z3 and Z5 3V ionization channels) to 5.4%\n\n\f10\n\nYNR -corrected (eV)\n\nQ-corrected (eV)\n\nDetector\n\n3V\n\n6V\n\n3V\n\n6V\n\nZ2\n\n95\n\n88\n\n223\n\n387\n\nZ3\n\n126\n\n114\n\n282\n\n477\n\nZ4\n\n208\n\n196\n\n398\n\n538\n\nZ5\n\n113\n\n102\n\n258\n\n450\n\nZ6\n\n185\n\n179\n\n434\n\n678\n\n(Z2 3V phonon channel) at 100 keV. As there are no\npeaked features due to internal Si isotope decays, the\nsame could not be done for the Si detectors except at\nzero energy, where resolution was determined solely by\nelectronic noise.\nA low-threshold analysis must take into account the\neffect of non-zero energy resolution near the detection\nthreshold. The dominant contribution to the resolution near threshold for all detectors was from electronic\nnoise. We therefore dropped the energy-dependent terms\nof each detector's energy resolution when calculating\nWIMP exclusion limits, and simply applied the zeroenergy resolution where needed. Exclusion limits calculated with omission of the energy-dependent terms give\nmore conservative limits than would be obtained with inclusion of those terms, and omission allows the Si and Ge\ndetectors to be treated in the same manner.\nAs will be discussed in more detail in Section IV C,\nwe made use of two forms of zero-energy resolution when\ncalculating WIMP exclusion limits: the YNR -corrected\nand the Q-corrected recoil-energy resolutions. The former is needed to include the effect of subthreshold pulses\noccasionally triggering the experiment due to phononnoise fluctuations, and therefore does not include any\nnoise contributions from the ionization channel. The latter represents the resolution intrinsic to the combined\nefficiency of the analysis cuts, and includes ionization as\nwell as phonon noise. The other-detector triggered data\nwere used to measure the YNR -corrected and Q-corrected\nrecoil-energy resolutions at 0 keV. The results are listed\nin Table III for the viable low-threshold detectors.\nThough the electron-recoil calibration is valuable for\nmeasuring detector performance, the nuclear-recoil energy scale is most important to WIMP searches.

Exponential fits are overlaid for\nboth data (blue/dark solid) and Monte Carlo (orange/light\nsolid). Despite the clear disagreement in absolute event rate,\ncomparison of the fitted decay constants provides a calibration of the nuclear-recoil energy scale for each target material. There is a 16\u00b13% discrepancy in the Si energy scale. A\nsmaller discrepancy is observed in the Ge energy scale, and is\nwithin two standard deviations (statistical) of expectation.\n\netry. In order to improve statistical power, we summed\nthe observed events to produce mean Ge and Si recoil\nspectra. Figure 7 shows the Monte Carlo and data distributions for both detector types with exponential fits,\nwhere the Si (Ge) spectra are well described by one (two)\ndecaying exponential(s). Comparison of the fitted decay\nconstants tests our nuclear-recoil energy scale without\nbeing sensitive to the obvious disagreement in absolute\nrate. Although difficult to perceive in Fig. 7, there is a\nsubstantial 16\u00b13% discrepancy in the Si detectors' energy scale. Without distinctive energy peaks with which\nto confirm the energy scale, we resolved the discrepancy\nby adjusting the Si recoil-energy scale upwards by 16%,\nwhich has the effect of making the Si upper limit (discussed in Section IV C) more conservative. The Si hardware and software thresholds and analysis cut efficiencies\ndiscussed above reflect this correction. A smaller discrepancy exists for the Ge detectors, where the low-energy\nportion of the recoil distribution is overestimated relative\nto the Monte Carlo, and the high-energy portion is underestimated. We did not make an analogous correction\nbecause the discrepancy is smaller (within two standard\ndeviations of expectation), and the calibration done with\nelectron-recoil peaks is more reliable. The choice to not\ncorrect the Ge recoil-energy scale leads to a slightly more\nconservative exclusion limit for low-mass WIMPs.\nThe effect \"ion channeling\" might have on a direct\ndetection experiment's energy scale has received con-\n\n\f11\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121 \u22121\n\nEvent rate (kg keV d )\n\nTABLE IV.

Early models [29, 30] for a NaI scintillation detector suggested that\na potentially significant fraction of recoiling nuclei might\nbe \"channeled\" between rows and planes within a detector's crystalline lattice, allowing them to interact more\nweakly with atomic cores and deposit more energy in\nthe form of ionization. The full recoil energy from a\nWIMP interaction might therefore be detected via electron recoils, beneficially lowering a NaI detector's effective energy threshold for nuclear recoils. In our detectors, the larger ionization signal associated with channeling would cause an elevated ionization yield for nuclear recoils, tending to push channeled nuclear recoils\ncloser to the electron-recoil population. Ion channeling\nwould therefore have a negative effect upon our nuclearrecoil acceptance efficiency. If the effect is particularly\npronounced for low recoil energies as suggested in [30],\nthe low-mass WIMP sensitivity of this analysis could be\nseverely impacted.\nAn upper limit on the fraction of channeled events near\nthreshold can be calculated with the 252 Cf data plotted\nin Fig. 4. For recoil energies between 2 keV and 6 keV,\nthe fraction of events with ionization yield above the\nnuclear-recoil band is less than 4%. Although this rate is\nhigher than the rate of electron recoils observed without\nthe source present, neutron interactions with materials\nnear the detectors can lead to secondary gamma rays.\nIn particular, neutron captures on hydrogen in the inner polyethylene shielding yield a continuum of electronrecoil energies due to the 2.2 MeV photons released in the\nprocess, biasing our channeling upper limit high. There\nwere also several \u223c1 MeV photons emitted directly from\nthe 252 Cf source with each fission. A limit on the channeling fraction that is less conservative, by incorporating a Monte Carlo estimate of the rate of nonchanneled\nelectron recoils during 252 Cf calibrations, is beyond the\nscope of this paper. Nevertheless, we do not see significant evidence of a channeling effect in our data that is\n\nGe\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\nRecoil energy (keV)\n\n100\n\nFIG. 8. (color online).

The uncorrected event rates (blue/dark thin\nsolid) are compared to the efficiency corrected event rates.\nThe latter are successively corrected by the exposure-weighted\ndetector-averaged efficiencies of the analysis cuts (black/dark\nthick solid), and then by the detector-averaged hardware and\nsoftware thresholds (orange/light thin solid).\n\nlarge enough to appreciably affect the efficiencies estimated in this analysis. We therefore ignore the effect of\nion channeling, a decision that is supported by the recent\nand more sophisticated models developed by Bozorgnia\net al. [31], which indicate that ion channeling for cryogenic Ge and Si targets is effectively nonexistent for low\nrecoil energies.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCandidate events\n\nFollowing application of the analysis cuts and phonon\nsoftware thresholds, a substantial residual rate of events\nis observed in the low-threshold signal region. We restrict our attention to events with recoil energies between\n0.5 keV (1 keV) and 100 keV for the Ge (Si) detectors,\nyielding a total of 1080 Ge and 970 Si candidate events.\nThe number of raw live days and corresponding number\nof candidate events for each detector and bias voltage are\nlisted in Table IV. The combined Ge and Si recoil-energy\nspectra are shown in Fig. 8, where the event rates have\nbeen successively corrected by the average efficiencies for\nthe analysis cuts, and then by the average hardware and\nsoftware thresholds. Since the recoil-energy spectra and\nthe former efficiencies are functions of Q-corrected recoil\nenergy, before dividing out the latter efficiencies they are\nconverted from YNR -corrected to Q-corrected recoil energy by smearing with the ionization noise.\n\n\f12\nB.\n\nBackgrounds\nZ5 (Ge)\n\nElectron\nCapture\nLines\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nElectron Recoils\n\n1\nIonization yield\n\nAlthough the recoil spectra resemble in shape the distributions expected for WIMP interactions, the events in\nthe signal region are likely due to several types of unrelated background processes consisting of electron recoils,\nzero-ionization events, 14 C contamination particular to\nZ6, and nuclear recoils from cosmogenic neutrons. We\nwill not subtract these events, but will accept them as\ncandidates for the purpose of calculating upper limits on\na WIMP signal; this is the most conservative treatment\nof these data.\nA few background populations are particularly evident\nin plots of ionization yield versus recoil energy. The signal regions and candidate events for representative Ge\nand Si detectors are displayed in Fig. 9. The most easily\nidentified background is specific to the Ge detectors. The\ndistinct 1.3 keV line between 1 keV and 3 keV in recoil energy accounts for a substantial number of the candidate\nevents. On average, the internal electron capture x-rays\nor Auger-electrons from the decays of 68 Ge and 71 Ge have\nunit ionization yield. Due to the relatively low signal-tonoise ratio at these energies in both phonons and ionization, however, electronic noise induces a large tail of\nelectron recoils to low ionization yield. The feature is\ntilted with respect to the recoil-energy axis because of\nanticorrelation between the numerator and denominator\nof the ionization yield expression. Leaked electron recoils\nfrom the 1.3 keV line account for \u223c20% of the Ge candidates in the 3V WIMP search, and for approximately\none-third (Z3) to one-half (Z2 and Z5) of the Ge candidates in the 6V WIMP search. The fraction is greater for\nthe 6V data because extensive 252 Cf neutron calibrations\nwere performed prior to this data period, enhancing the\nlevels of 71 Ge via thermal neutron capture.\nAlthough more prominent for the Si detectors, both\nthe Ge and Si detectors are afflicted by a distribution\nof events with nearly zero ionization yield. Close examination reveals that these \"zero-charge\" events possess\nionization signals indistinguishable from electronic noise.\nThey are otherwise normal events with recoil energies\nas large as 100 keV in some instances. The distribution\nof zero-charge events for the Si detector in Fig. 9 spans\nthe full analysis energy range, and clearly crosses into\nthe signal region for recoil energies .7 keV, constituting the majority of this detector's candidate events. A\npossible explanation is that these events were the result\nof recoils that occurred near the side edges of the ZIP\ndetectors, where electric field lines did not span the detectors' 1 cm thicknesses. Ionization occurring along field\nlines that terminate on a detector's edge rather than on\nan electrode is not properly drifted across the crystal,\nresulting in no signals in either the inner or outer ionization electrodes. For recoil energies &10 keV, the zerocharge events' xy-positions can be reliably reconstructed,\nand tend to cluster near detector edges. Past analyses of CDMS data have avoided zero-charge events by\nrequiring WIMP candidates to have a minimum ioniza-\n\nIonization yield\n\n1\n\nZ4 (Si)\nNuclear Recoils\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nZero\nIonization\nEvents\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n10\nRecoil energy (keV)\n\n100\n\nFIG. 9.

Unfortunately, an ionization threshold\nwould severely limit our WIMP detection efficiency for\nrecoil energies .5 keV.\nThe significantly higher event rate for Z6 is believed to\nbe due to 14 C surface contamination. Prior to Run 21,\nduring testing at one of the CDMS test facilities, Z6 was\noperated in close proximity to a detector that had been\npreviously exposed to a 14 C calibration source with faulty\nencapsulation, accidentally contaminating one of its surfaces with a low level of the isotope. For this reason,\nZ6 was placed at the bottom of the detector tower with\nits contaminated surface facing away from the adjacent\ndetector. Beta decays of 14 C produce electrons with an\naverage energy of \u223c50 keV and a maximum energy of\n\u223c156 keV. Beta radiation in this energy range will interact entirely within a ZIP detector's \u223c10 \u03bcm surface\ndead layer, where the charge collection efficiency is considerably reduced. These events have reduced ionization\nyield, and populate the gap between the bands of electron and nuclear recoils when plotted in the fashion of\nFig. 9, with a substantial number leaking into the signal\nregion. Although surface events can be rejected with high\nefficiency for recoil energies &10 keV through a combination of phonon and ionization pulse timing parameters,\nthe near-threshold WIMP detection efficiency cannot be\npreserved.\nLeakage of electron recoils into the nuclear-recoil band\nis a component of each detector's candidate events, although the source is usually Compton scatters of pho-\n\n\f13\ntons. The discrimination based on ionization yield\nbreaks down as the recoil energy decreases, until at the\n\"crossover energy\" the electron- and nuclear-recoil bands\nsignificantly overlap. The crossover energy varies from\n\u223c3 keV (Z5 3V) to \u223c7 keV (Z6 6V). More NeganovLuke phonons are produced when the detectors are run\nat higher bias voltage, causing degradation in both the\nrecoil-energy resolution and the yield-based discrimination. Consequently, ZIP detectors perform better as lowthreshold detectors with the lower 3V bias voltage. Scaling calibration data from a 60 Co source results in the\nestimate that only a few Compton electron-recoil events\nper detector leak into the nuclear-recoil band for recoil\nenergies above the crossover energy. We have not devised a reliable method of estimating the contribution of\nCompton electron-recoil leakage for recoil energies below\nthe crossover energy. We estimate that 10% to 20% of\nthe WIMP candidates are actually electron recoils from\nCompton scatters.\nThe highest-energy signal events are largely due to the\nneutron background associated with the SUF's modest\noverburden. Muons (and hadronic showers produced by\nthem) occasionally broke apart nuclei in the rock surrounding the experiment, expelling high-energy neutrons\nwith sufficient energy to punch through our shielding\nand create lower-energy neutron secondaries within the\nshielding materials capable of producing signals above\nthreshold. The expected rate of these unvetoed neutron interactions as a function of recoil energy was simulated for the Ge detectors (dashed curve in Fig. 2 in\n[18]). With no efficiencies applied, the rate peaks at\n\u223c0.1 events kg\u22121 keV\u22121 d\u22121 at the 0.5 keV cutoff, and decays quasiexponentially to \u223c0.003 events kg\u22121 keV\u22121 d\u22121\nat 100 keV. Application of the Ge detectors' average detection efficiencies, followed by a scaling to the \u223c71 kgdays of Ge exposure, yields an expectation of \u223c66 neutrons among the 1080 Ge candidate events.\nAn accurate accounting of the contribution of each\nsource of background to the total number of candidate\nevents is difficult. Most candidate events have low recoil\nenergies for which our experimental variables are unable\nto differentiate among the various sources, particularly\nfor the zero-charge and Compton electron-recoil leakage\nbackgrounds. An approximate tally of the percentage of\ncandidate events due to each background source is listed\nin Table V for the combined Ge and Si detector ensembles, where an \"other\" category is included to indicate\nthe percentage of events that are not attributed to the\nbackground sources as described above. The other events\ncould be due to unidentified sources of background or\nWIMPs, but probably reflect systematic uncertainty in\nthe estimates for the known background sources.\n\nC.\n\nExclusion limits\n\nThe large uncertainties associated with our background sources preclude the subtraction of backgrounds.\n\nTABLE V.

We use the observed event rates to set upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic scattering cross section as a function of WIMP mass. Two\nlimits are calculated; the main result of this paper is a\ncombined Ge and Si exclusion limit based upon all 2050\nsignal events, while a secondary result focuses on the Si\ndata alone.\nTo calculate exclusion limits the observed event rates\nmust be compared to a hypothetical WIMP model. For\nconvenient comparison with the results of other direct\ndetection experiments, we work within the framework of\nthe \"standard\" halo model described in [14], but normalized to a local WIMP density of 0.3 GeV/cm3 . We also\nconformed to the dark matter community's standard assumptions for the WIMP characteristic and mean Earth\nvelocities of 220 km/s and 232 km/s, respectively [16],\nwhile assuming the more recently estimated value of\n544 km/s for the galactic escape velocity [15]. The effect\nof the galactic escape velocity on these results is discussed\nin more detail in Section IV D.\nLimits were calculated using a version of Yellin's \"optimum interval\" method [32] that has been extended to\naccommodate high statistics [33]. For each choice of\nWIMP mass, the limit is essentially determined by a\nsingle energy interval for which the number of observed\nevents is particularly low relative to the expected number of WIMP events. An appropriate statistical penalty\nis applied for choosing the interval that sets the best\nlimit, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit. This\nmethod is especially effective at discriminating against\nbackgrounds which are distributed differently from the\nexpected signal.\n\n\f14\n\u221238\n\n10\nWIMP\u2212nucleon cross section (cm2)\n\nTo calculate a single exclusion limit, the data from the\nindividual Ge and Si detectors have to be appropriately\ncombined. Traditionally, CDMS has combined the detector ensemble into a single averaged detector, where the\nindividual-detector masses and efficiencies are averaged\naccording to their exposures. This \"averaged\" method\nfor combining detectors makes use of the entire exposure,\nand comingles the candidate event energies for different\ndetectors before forming the energy intervals required by\nthe optimum interval method. Figure 8 represents the\naveraged version of the candidate event data for this analysis. The averaging method is appropriate when the detectors involved have approximately equal sensitivity to\nWIMP interactions, as was the case for previous CDMS\nWIMP-search results in which the analyses were either\nbackground-free or nearly so.\nWhen the averaging technique is applied to detectors\nwith variable event rates, the detectors with especially\nhigh event rates effectively pollute the lower-rate detectors by filling in the most sensitive intervals with a disproportionate number of events. For this reason, we decided\nto adopt a novel \"serialization\" technique for combining\nthe detector data. Energy intervals are separately prepared for each detector in order to preserve the most\nsensitive intervals. The intervals are then concatenated\nin an arbitrary order which, to avoid possible bias, was\nselected before the effect of the order was known. We\nchose to place the 3V data before the 6V data, and then\nto order them according to their position within the detector tower (from top to bottom). If the limit-setting\nintervals do not span multiple detectors, the order will\nnot affect the result. This technique allows the optimum interval method to calculate the limit from the best\nindividual-detector energy intervals. The resulting limit\nreflects only a fraction of the exposure, rather than the\ntotal exposure for the entire detector ensemble. This is\na trade-off we decided to accept before calculating the\nlimits. Each detector is clearly background-limited, particularly near threshold where our low-mass WIMP sensitivity resides. Trading exposure for cleaner energy intervals should yield stronger limits for low masses. In hindsight, this turned out to be true for WIMP masses less\nthan 8 GeV/c2 . The serialization technique also allows\nfor different detector types within the detector ensemble,\nproviding a natural method for combining the Ge and Si\ndata.\nTo include the effect of non-zero energy resolution\nproperly, expected WIMP rates were separately calculated for each detector and WIMP search (3V and 6V\ndata) in a series of steps. The limit was calculated for\n75 WIMP masses between 1 GeV/c2 and 100 GeV/c2 .\nAt each mass, the halo model predicts the differential WIMP-nucleon scattering rate in terms of an ideal,\nperfect-resolution recoil energy (see Fig. 1 for example).\nEach detector's ideal spectrum was then convolved with\nits YNR -corrected recoil-energy resolution listed in Table III (first two columns).

After application of these phonononly efficiencies, the spectrum was further smeared to\ninclude the electronic noise of the ionization channel via\na second convolution with the quadrature difference between the Q-corrected (third and fourth columns of Table III) and YNR -corrected recoil-energy resolutions. The\nthreshold-reduced expected WIMP spectrum, in terms\nof Q-corrected recoil energy as measured by a ZIP detector, was then multiplied by the remaining analysis cut\nefficiencies, which either depend weakly on this energy\nestimator or are constant. Finally each detector's doubly smeared and efficiency-reduced expected WIMP rate\nwas scaled by the detector's mass and exposure (listed\nin Tables I and IV). The resulting distribution of expected events per Q-corrected keV for each detector was\nused to construct a cumulative probability that describes\nhow likely it is that a WIMP interaction deposited an\nenergy within each energy interval defined by that detector's candidate event energies.

Comparison of 90% confidence\nlevel upper limits from the combined Ge and Si (black/dark\nsolid, our main result) and Si only (gray/light solid) data,\nwith those from XENON100 with constant (orange/light\ndotted) or decreasing (orange/light dashed) scintillation efficiency extrapolations at low energy [37], CoGeNT [35]\n(+), and CRESST [38] (blue/dark dash-dotted). Our limits (and XENON100's) assume a galactic escape velocity of\n544 km/s [15], while the CRESST limit uses 650 km/s and the\nCoGeNT limit uses 600 km/s. See also Fig. 12 in which limits\nfor other escape velocities are compared.\n\nual probability distributions were serialized as described\nabove, and a combined Ge and Si (Si only) optimum interval upper limit was calculated at each WIMP mass.\nNote that although particular care was taken to include\nthe effect of non-zero energy resolution for this result, it\nwould have made only a trivial contribution to the sensitivities of previous CDMS results due to their higher\nthresholds.\nThe resulting exclusion limits are shown in Fig. 10,\nand partially exclude parameter space associated with\npotential signals from the DAMA/LIBRA [13, 34] and\nCoGeNT [35] experiments. The former includes the\n(small) effect of ion channeling as modeled by Bozorgnia\net al. [31]. The combined Ge and Si limit cuts through\nthe middle of the 99% confidence level signal region associated with Hooper et al.'s [36] simultaneous fit to the\nDAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT data, and excludes new parameter space for WIMP masses between 3 GeV/c2 and\n4 GeV/c2 . Our limits are compared to those from other\nexperiments with strong low-mass WIMP sensitivity in\nFig. 11. The additional information required to reproduce our results can be found in [39], and includes the\nefficiencies and candidate event energies for each detector\nand voltage bias.\nA limit based on the Ge data alone was also calculated,\nand found to be almost equal to the combined Ge and\nSi limit (the difference is imperceptible in Fig.s 10 and\n12). The serialization technique sets the limit according\n\nto the most sensitive detectors. The Ge detectors were\nmore sensitive across the range of WIMP masses considered, yielding a combined Ge and Si limit that is almost\nthe same as the Ge only limit. We decided beforehand\nthat the combined detector limit would be our main result, but that we would publish the Ge only and Si only\nlimits as well. The limit for low masses (.6 GeV/c2 )\nwas determined by Z2 3V and 6V intervals, while a combination of the Z5 3V, Z5 6V, and Z2 3V data set the\nlimit for WIMP masses &10 GeV/c2 . The sensitivity in\nthe intervening mass range was dominated by the Z3 3V\ndata. Each Si detector contributes to the Si only sensitivity, with the Z6 data providing the best limit for\nmasses .4 GeV/c2 , and the Z4 data for larger WIMP\nmasses. None of the intervals chosen by this serialized\nimplementation of the optimum interval method spanned\nmore than one detector, confirming that the order of the\nserialization is unimportant.\n\nD.\n\nSystematic studies\n\nA recent study by Smith et al. [15] analyzed the highest velocity halo stars in an early release of data from\nthe RAVE survey [40], and derived a loose but convincing constraint on the galactic escape velocity. At the\n90% confidence level, their preferred range of escape velocities is 498 km/s to 608 km/s, with a median value\nof 544 km/s. Though based on an otherwise identically\nnormalized standard halo model, the results for the other\nexperiments shown in Figs. 10 and 11 assume a variety of\ngalactic escape velocities which are generally larger. The\nCRESST [38] limit is based on a much larger 650 km/s\nvalue, while the DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT results (including the Hooper et al. region) use 600 km/s. Although\nwe have chosen to adopt the more recent measurement of\n544 km/s for this paper, additional limits were calculated\nto see the effect of the larger, 650 km/s escape velocity.\nThere is very little visible difference in the main result\nfor WIMP masses larger than 4 GeV/c2 , while the Si only\nlimit assuming the lower escape velocity is as much as\n20% weaker for WIMP masses between 6 GeV/c2 and\n10 GeV/c2 . The effect of changing the escape velocity\nbecomes important for masses less than 4 GeV/c2 . Limits based on the 650 km/s and 544 km/s galactic escape\nvelocities for WIMP masses down to 1 GeV/c2 are compared in Figure 12. Regions corresponding to Smith et\nal.'s 90% confidence interval are plotted as well. The effect is nearly maximal for a 2 GeV/c2 WIMP mass, where\nthe combined Ge and Si limits span over an order of magnitude, and the Si only limits span over two orders of\nmagnitude.\nThe detection efficiencies associated with each detector's hardware and software phonon thresholds, and analysis cuts, were estimated directly from data. In each case,\nthe estimates are based on a finite number of events,\nresulting in statistical uncertainties.

The 90% C.L. upper limits from\nthe combined Ge and Si and Si only data for WIMP masses\ndown to 1 GeV/c2 and an assumed galactic escape velocity of\n544 km/s [15] (black/dark solid and gray/light solid, respectively), compared to limits from the same data for an escape\nvelocity of 650 km/s [16] (black/dark dashed and gray/light\ndashed, respectively). The ranges of combined Ge and Si\n(blue/dark shaded) and Si only (yellow/light shaded) limits\ncorresponding to the 90% C.L. range of escape velocities found\nby Smith et al. [15], and the limits from the CRESST [38]\n(blue/dark dash-dotted, 650 km/s) and CoGeNT [35] (+,\n600 km/s) experiments are shown as well.\n\nmental sensitivity for WIMP masses less than 6 GeV/c2 .\nThe combined Ge and Si exclusion limit for a 5 GeV/c2\nWIMP, for example, is \u223c20% weaker when the 90% C.L.\nlower limit efficiencies (1.28\u03c3 less than the mean) are\nsubstituted for the best-fit mean efficiencies. The effect is maximal for a 1 GeV/c2 WIMP, where the same\nWIMP exclusion limit is a factor of 5 weaker. Again,\nwe decided to adopt a conservative approach and employ the 90% C.L. (statistical) lower limit efficiencies in\nall our WIMP exclusion limit calculations. The best-fit\nmean efficiencies are compared to these reduced efficiencies in Fig. 5 for representative Ge and Si detectors. All\nfigures and tables in this paper preceding Figs. 10\u201312 reflect the best-fit mean efficiencies where applicable, while\nFigs. 10\u201312 are based on reduced detection efficiencies\nsuch as those shown in Fig. 5.\nThe combined Ge and Si exclusion limit was also\ntested for sensitivity to uncertainties in the Ge detectors' electron-recoil energy scales. Each Ge ZIP's YER corrected and Q-corrected recoil energy scales for electron recoils were checked for the entire 3V and 6V WIMP\nsearches using the lines described previously. The three\npeaks' mean energies were estimated with Gaussian fits\nrelative to energy scales originally derived from short\n137\nCs calibrations. Deviations between the observed\nand expected peak energies were generally within statistical fluctuations. A few detectors, however, exhibited sizable phonon signal overestimates for the 1.3 keV\n\nline. The worst case was for the Z2 6V data, where the\nYER -corrected recoil energy was over measured by \u223c6%,\nand the Q-corrected recoil energy was over measured by\n\u223c16%. The latter is worse because it includes an ionization signal under-measurement in conjunction with a\nphonon signal over-measurement. An ad hoc recalibration of the Ge recoil-energy estimators was performed\nand the WIMP exclusion limits were recalculated. Because the energy scale discrepancies mostly involve recoilenergy overestimates, the combined Ge and Si limit based\non the recalibrated energy scales is slightly stronger. The\nlimit is mostly insensitive to the recalibration, however,\nwith the difference in limits only becoming visible by eye\nfor the lowest WIMP masses. The effect is maximal for\na WIMP mass of 1 GeV/c2 , where the recalibrated limit\nis a factor of \u223c2 stronger. The final limits shown in\nFigs. 10\u201312 are based on the original Ge detectors' energy scales, a slightly conservative choice that avoids the\nsystematic uncertainty associated with the ad hoc recalibration.\n\nIt is easy to imagine that our low-mass WIMP sensitivity might be heavily reliant on the lowest-energy trigger\nefficiency, and on our inclusion of the effect of non-zero\nenergy resolution near threshold. If true, then relatively\nmodest unknown systematic uncertainties in the hardware trigger efficiencies could lead to large uncertainties in the WIMP exclusion limits. The combined Ge\nand Si limit was tested for sensitivity to potential trigger efficiency systematic uncertainty in two ways. First,\neach detector's hardware trigger efficiency was set equal\nto zero wherever it drops below 10%, eliminating the\nlowest-energy detection efficiency. The limit based on\nthe reduced trigger efficiencies is reassuringly not much\nweaker than the limit using the full efficiencies. The\ndifference is maximal at 1 GeV/c2 , where the reducedefficiency limit is \u223c3% weaker. Second, the sensitivity to\npossible systematic uncertainty associated with the inclusion of near-threshold energy resolution was tested by\nsmearing the hardware trigger efficiencies by 50% of the\nYNR -corrected recoil-energy resolutions (\u223c50 eV for Ge,\nand \u223c100 eV for Si) before applying them in the limit\ncalculation described above. This addresses a concern\nthat there might be an unknown extra resolution factor\nincluded in the hardware trigger efficiency estimates due\nto the difference between the phonon signal that triggers\nthe experiment and the offline reconstructed phonon energy. It would actually be more appropriate to deconvolve the trigger efficiencies, but the reverse operation is\neasier to implement, and although it will give a stronger\nrather than weaker limit, the size of the effect should be\nsimilar. The resulting limit is indeed stronger, but only\nslightly so. The size of the effect reaches a maximum for\na 1 GeV/c2 WIMP mass, where the difference is \u223c5%.\nOur low-mass WIMP sensitivity appears to be relatively\ninsensitive to systematic uncertainties in the hardware\ntrigger efficiencies.\n\n\f17\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWithin the dark matter community, possible signals\nfrom the DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT experiments have\naroused renewed interest in relatively low-mass WIMPs.\nDespite substantial backgrounds, CDMS ZIPs are excellent low-threshold detectors. The analysis presented\nhere is background-limited and conservative, yet sets\ncompetitive limits for low WIMP masses on the spinindependent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross section. Under standard halo assumptions, we partially exclude the parameter space favored by interpretations of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation and CoGeNT excess as WIMP signals. Ignoring the effect due to uncertainty related to the galactic escape velocity, the limits\nare robust for WIMP masses greater than \u223c2 GeV/c2 .\n\nof information for probing low-mass WIMP parameter\nspace.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe methods developed for this low-threshold analysis are not limited to the Run 21 shallow-site data. An\nupcoming analysis based on CDMS II data taken at our\ndeep site in the Soudan Mine employs a similar but lowerbackground analysis technique, and achieves similar\nrecoil-energy thresholds for a significantly greater exposure. We have also experimented with operating CDMS\ndetectors at very high bias voltages (\u223c100 V), sacrificing\nour two-channel discrimination in favor of ultra-low energy thresholds (\u223c50 eV) via Neganov-Luke phonon amplification [41]. The CDMS II data are a rich source\n\nThe CDMS collaboration gratefully acknowledges the\ncontributions of numerous engineers and technicians; we\nwould like to especially thank Judith Alvaro-Dean, Jim\nBeaty, Sam Burke, Daniel Callahan, Pat Castle, John\nEmes, Merle Haldeman, David Hale, Michael Hennessey,\nWayne Johnson, Jim Perales, Garth Smith and Astrid\nTomada.
