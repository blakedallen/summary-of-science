This has\nallowed the observation of single matter wave bright solitons with thousands of atoms [1] or a train of solitons\n[2] with 7 Li atoms trapped in a one-dimensional (1D)\ngeometry. These solitons are quantum bound states of\na mesoscopic gas, which opens up fascinating possibilities: Apart from testing mean field predictions in these\nsystems [3], one can address truly quantum problems, issuing from the quantum nature of the gas center of mass.\nIn particular, it was recently proposed to use a BoseEinstein condensate in interferometric experiments to\ntest the existence of decoherence mechanisms not predicted by usual quantum mechanics and that would show\nup for very massive particles [4]. Experiments have succeeded in observing interferences with molecules as big as\nfullerenes and there is a need for more massive interferometric objects [5]. A soliton with a small number of 100\n7\nLi atoms has the same mass as C60 , with appealing new\nfeatures: It does not have internal bound states other\nthan its ground state, it can be reversibly dissociated in\nan unbound atomic gas via a Feshbach resonance, and it\nallows the exploration of a new regime, in which the center of mass kinetic energy of the interfering object is of\nthe same order as the binding energy of its constituents.\nFurthermore, thanks to the extremely low temperatures accessible in atomic gases, down to 0.45nK [6], and\nthe weak decoherence present in these systems [7], one\nmay hope to split the center of mass wavefunction of the\nsolitonic gas in two wavepackets that would keep their\nmutual coherence over mesoscopic distances, say a fraction of a millimeter, much larger than the size of the soliton. The gas would then have simultaneously non-zero\nprobability amplitudes of being in two different spatial\nlocations, thus forming a mesoscopic Schr\u00f6dinger cat in\nreal space. One may then ascertain the presence of a cat\nstate by recombining and interfering these two mesoscopically different quantum states of the gas. This would\nconstitute a generalization to many atoms of the oneion experiment of [8]. While mesoscopic Schr\u00f6dinger cat\nstates have been reported for radiation fields [9] they have\nnot been reported yet with ultracold atoms, and atom op-\n\ntics with a quantum soliton is a promising alternative to\nexisting ideas for cat production in these systems [10].\nThe dynamics of the center of mass wavepacket during\nthe scattering of the soliton on a barrier raises non trivial\ntheoretical issues, since the presence of the barrier makes\nthe 1D many-body problem non integrable via the Bethe\nAnsatz. We thus construct an approximate effective lowenergy Hamiltonian for the center of mass of the gas, and\nwe derive a rigorous upper bound on the resulting error.\nThe starting point is the many-body Hamiltonian in\n1D, for N bosonic particles of mass m interacting via\nthe usual contact interaction of coupling constant g, in\npresence of the barrier potential U (x) \u2265 0:\n\u0015\nN \u0014 2\nX\nX\npi\n\u03b4(xi \u2212 xj ).\n(1)\n+ U (xi ) + g\nH=\n2m\ni<j\ni=1\nThis is conveniently rewritten as H = P 2 /(2M )+Hin +V ,\nsingling out the kinetic energy of the center of mass\n(M = N m is the total mass and P the total momentum of the gas), the so-called internal Hamiltonian Hin\nand the sum of the N barrier potentials, V . Without\na barrier (V \u2261 0) there is full separability between the\ncenter of mass and the internal variables, so that we split\nthe Hilbert space as a tensorial product of center of mass\nand internal variables. Hin is diagonalized with the Bethe\nansatz [11]: For N fixed, its ground state is its single discrete eigenstate, the quantum soliton |\u03c6i of energy E0 (N )\n[12], separated from a continuum of solitonic fragments\nby an energy gap which is minus the chemical potential,\nmg 2 N (N \u2212 1)\n. (2)\n8~2\nIn presence of a barrier, we consider the scattering state\n|\u03a8i of the soliton with an incoming center of mass\nwavevector K > 0. We restrict to a low incoming kinetic energy to have elastic scattering,\n|\u03bc| = E0 (N \u2212 1) \u2212 E0 (N ) =\n\n~2 K 2\n< |\u03bc|.\n(3)\n2M\nFar from the barrier, one can then observe only a nonfragmented soliton, to the right with the transmission\namplitude t, to the left with the reflection amplitude r.\nE \u2212 E0 \u2261\n\n\f2\nIn this elastic regime, an effective hermitian Hamiltonian\nmay be defined, introducing the projector P = ICoM \u2297\n|\u03c6ih\u03c6| acting as the identity on the center of mass and\nprojecting the internal state on its ground state, so that\nP|\u03a8i = |\u03a6i \u2297 |\u03c6i.\n\n(4)\n\nFar from the barrier, \u03a6(X) is simply the center of mass\nwavefunction, X being the center of mass position. The\nso-called PGP formalism, where G is the resolvent of the\nfull Hamiltonian [13], then gives the exact equation\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nP\n~2 K 2\n|\u03a6i =\n+ V\u0304 (X) + \u03b4V |\u03a6i.\n(5)\n2M\n2M\nThe first contribution to the effective potential, in the\nright hand side of (5), is the convolution of the barrier\npotential with the internal density profile of the soliton:\nZ +\u221e\nV\u0304 (X) = h\u03c6|V |\u03c6i =\ndx U (X \u2212 x)\u03c1(x|0) (6)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03c1(x|0) is the mean density of particles in the soliton knowing that the center of mass is localized in X = 0.\nIt was calculated with the Bethe ansatz [14] and is well\napproximated for N \u226b 1 by the mean field density profile\n\u03c1(x|0) \u2243 N/[4\u03be cosh2 (x/2\u03be)], where the mean field soliton size is \u03be = ~2 /(m|g|N ).

We shall neglect this contribution but\nnot without a justification. From the fact that QHQ \u2265\nE0 + |\u03bc|, a consequence of the positivity of P 2 /2M and\nV , and of the energy gap of Hin , we see in the regime (3)\nthat the operator \u2212\u03b4V is positive and bounded as\n\u2212 \u03b4V \u2264 W (X) \u2261\n\nh\u03c6|V 2 |\u03c6i \u2212 V\u0304 (X)2\n.\n|\u03bc| \u2212 ~2 K 2 /2M\n\n(8)\n\nWhen one neglects \u03b4V in (5), the exact \u03a6(X) is replaced\nby \u03a60 (X), which involves the same incoming wave eiKX ,\nbut with outgoing waves eiK|X| whose transmission and\nreflection amplitudes t0 and r0 are only approximate. We\nhave rigorously bounded the resulting errors. We discuss\nhere only the experimentally relevant case of an even barrier U (x) = U (\u2212x).

An axial\nGaussian laser beam confines N \u2243 100 atoms of 7 Li in\nthe y \u2212 z plane, with a resulting transverse harmonic\noscillator length a\u22a5 = (~/m\u03c9\u22a5 )1/2 \u2243 0.54\u03bcm, where\n\u03c9\u22a5 \u2243 2\u03c0 \u00d7 4.8KHz is the transverse oscillation frequency.\nIn this optical wave guide, the interacting gas has a one\ndimensional character if 2\u03be \u226b a\u22a5 . In order to make\ncooling of the gas not too challenging, we take a not too\nlarge soliton length \u03be \u2243 0.9\u03bcm; the resulting 3D scattering length, a \u2243 \u2212a2\u22a5 /(2N \u03be) \u2243 \u22121.72nm is in the interval of values (\u2212\u221e, \u22121.5nm) accessible with the Feshbach resonance [1]. Initially the gas is also harmonically\ntrapped along x with an oscillation frequency \u03c9. The gas\nis assumed to be cooled to the temperature T = 0.45nK\n[6]. This axial trap is so weak that it very weakly affects the internal solitonic variables, ~\u03c9 < |\u03bc|/10, but it\nis strong enough that the center of mass of the gas, still\nseparable in a harmonic trap, has a negligible probability\nexp(\u2212~\u03c9/kB T ) < 1/10 to be in an excited state. These\ntwo constraints impose the weak value \u03c9 \u2243 2\u03c0 \u00d7 23.5Hz.\nThey also imply |\u03bc|/kB T \u2243 25, so that the internal variables of the soliton are frozen in their ground state.\nAt t = 0, the gas is launched with a total momentum\n~K0 such that\n|\u03bc|\n~2\n~2 K02\n.\n=\n\u2243\n2M\n2\n16m\u03be 2\n\n(15)\n\n\f\u03a6(X) \u221d eiK0 X e\u2212(X\u2212X0 )\n\n2\n\n(\u2206K)\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nWith a sudden opening of the axial trap [18],\n~2 (\u2206K)2 /2M = ~\u03c9/4 and \u2206K/K0 \u2243 0.22 \u226a 1: This\nwavepacket is quasi-monochromatic. Smaller values of\n\u2206K may be obtained by a more clever opening procedure\nof the trap, within times \u223c 1/\u03c9 [19]. The wavepacket is\nthen scattered on a broad Gaussian barrier centered in\nx = 0 (here X0 < 0), a beam-splitter, created by a laser\nbeam of waist b = 5\u03be \u226b \u03be and of intensity adjusted to\nsatisfy the half-transmission probability condition (11).\nIn any realistic case, \u2206K remains much larger than \u03b4K,\nso the wavepacket experiences a mere filtering in Fourier\nspace, the components with K > K0 being transmitted\nand the ones with K < K0 being reflected [20]. As a\nconsequence, the wavepacket also splits in real space in\na transmitted part and a reflected part, that nicely separate since their mean velocity exceeds their spreading\nvelocity: A mesoscopic Schr\u00f6dinger cat is born.\nHow to prove this experimentally ? The first step is to\ncheck the absence of fragmentation: A photo of the gas\nby absorption imaging should show, for any realization\nof the experiment, that all the particles are clustered in\na single lump of size \u03be, randomly situated to the left\nor to the right of the beam-splitter. The second step\nis to check that the two wavepackets are coherent, by\nrecombining them and looking for interference fringes,\nwith a fringe spacing \u03c0/K0 . The recombination of the\ntwo wavepackets is obtained by their total reflection on\nmirrors, produced by two Gaussian laser beams centered\nin x = L/2 and x = \u2212L/2, L \u226b 1/\u2206K, with the same\nwaist as the beam splitter but with a higher intensity\n(say, twice as high). The reflected wavepackets interfere\naround x = 0, the beam splitter being switched off [21].\nWe have studied the proposed experiment by a numerical solution of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation for the center of\nmass wavefunction, with the initial condition (16) and\nthe same approximate effective Hamiltonian as in scattering theory:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n~2 2\n\u2202X + V\u0304 (X, t) \u03a6(X, t)\n(17)\ni~\u2202t \u03a6(X, t) = \u2212\n2M\nThe center of mass probability distribution |\u03a6(X, t)|2 is\nplotted at key times in Fig.1. To quantify the contrast of\nthe interference fringes, we also Rplotted the modulus of its\n+\u221e\nFourier transform, s(Q, t) = \u2212\u221e dX e\u2212iQX |\u03a6(X, t)|2 .\nWhen the two wavepackets overlap, sharp peaks in |s(Q)|\nindeed form in Q \u2243 \u00b12K0, with a contrast |s| \u2243 0.32.\nThis is a high value, as the ideal case of two overlapping\nplane waves \u03a6(X) \u221d eiK0 X + e\u2212iK0 X gives 1/2.\nThe high contrast interference fringes in Fig.1 are however for the center of mass probability distribution, not\n\n|s(Q,t)|\n\nt=0\n\n|\u03a6(X,t)|\n\nThe corresponding velocity is ~K0 /M \u2243 0.37mm/s. Simultaneously the axial trap is switched off, to free the\ncenter of mass of the gas, with an initial wavepacket\n\n2\n\n3\n\nt=0.63\nt=0.79\nt=1.14\nt=1.31\nt=1.36\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n-40 -20\n\n0 20\nX [\u03be]\n\n40\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n5\nQ [1/\u03be]\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: Evolution of the center of mass wavefunction of a\nsolitonic gas with N = 99 atoms, by integration of (17) for\nthe initial condition (16), with \u2206K \u2243 0.093K0 , X0 = \u221215\u03be.\nLeft panel: |\u03a6(X, t)|2 (solid lines), effective potential V\u0304 (X, t)\n(dashed lines). Right panel: modulus of the Fourier transform\ns(Q, t) of |\u03a6(X, t)|2 ; the vertical lines are in Q = \u00b12K0 . The\ntime is in units of M L/~K0 . At t = 0.63 the state is a cat. At\nt = 1.31 the two reflected cat components strongly interfere,\ntwo narrow peaks of height 0.315 emerge on |s(Q)| in Q =\n\u00b12K0 . Maximal interference occurs at t = 1.36. The last line\nis an average over a Poisson distribution for N , with a mean\nvalue N\u0304 = 99; the peak height in |s(Q)| is reduced to 0.062.\n\nfor the atomic density, which raises the question of their\nobservability by usual fluorescence imaging. The mean\natomic density \u03c1(x) is the convolution of |\u03a6(X)|2 with\nthe internal soliton density \u03c1(x|0); since the soliton size\n\u03be is as large as the fringe spacing \u03c0/K0 , one finds that the\ncontrast of the fringes in \u03c1(x) is several orders of magnitude smaller than in |\u03a6(X)|2 . This problem can be\nsolved by increasing, just before imaging, the intensity of\nthe laser producing the transverse trapping by a factor\nabout 21, which reduces the transverse harmonic oscillator length to \u00e3\u22a5 = 0.25\u03bcm and brings the soliton close\nto its collapse threshold N |a|/\u00e3\u22a5 \u2243 0.67 [22]. Furthermore fluorescence imaging can be optimized to measure\ndirectly the quantity |s(2K0 )|, by exciting the gas with a\nlaser standing wave along x, produced by the superposition of two laser waves of wavevectors ~k\u00b1 = (\u00b1kx , ky , 0)\nat some angle with the x axis such that ~k+ \u2212~k\u2212 = 2K0~ex .\nThe resulting fluorescence rate in direction ~n per unit\nof solid angle is given in the Born approximation by\n2\nPN\nd\u0393/d\u03a9 \u221d h i=1 e\u2212ik~n*~ri e(~ri ) i, with validity conditions\ndiscussed in [23]. Here e(~r ) is the laser electric field. The\nemission rate \u0393\u03a9 of photons in the solid angle \u03a9 of the\ndetection lens is an oscillating function of the location of\nthe antinodes of the laser standing wave with respect to\nthe interference pattern in |\u03a6(X)|2 , with a contrast\n\u0393max\n\u2212 \u0393min\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n= |s(2K0 )|Sin (\u03a9).\nmax\n\u0393\u03a9 + \u0393min\n\u03a9\n\n(18)\n\n\f4\nThe reduction factor Sin (\u03a9) is a function of the 3D static\nstructure factor of the soliton for fixed center of mass\nposition, that we approximate with the 3D mean field\ntheory. By using a lens of optical axis along ~k+ + ~k\u2212\nwith a numerical aperture 0.4, one finds the remarkably\nhigh value Sin (\u03a9) = 0.84, thanks to a superradiant effect\n[23], which also concentrates 16% of the fluorescence in\nthe 4% solid angle fraction collected by the lens.\nIt remains to check that decoherence is negligible during the transit time ttrans = M L/~K0 . 200ms of the\ncat state in the interferometer. In cold atom experiments, the main source of decoherence is particle losses:\nA single loss event would destroy the cat, since it \"measures\" the positions of one or several atoms and localizes the center of mass of the gas within the soliton\nsize \u03be. The usual\nR loss rate formula for m-body loss is\ndN/dt = \u2212Km d3 r nm (~r ); here one should take for n\nthe 3D density profile for a fixed center of mass position,\nthat we approximate with the mean field theory. For onebody losses due to collisions with the background gas, one\nshould have a loss probability K1 N ttrans < 1/10, which\nimposes the reasonable lifetime K1\u22121 > 200s. For threebody losses due to formation of deeply bound dimers,\nthe loss constant K3 for 7 Li at the considered magnetic\nfield B is not known. Since |a| is smaller than the Van\nder Waals length 3nm, as it is for B = 0, we use the\nB = 0 prediction of [24], applying the factor 6 reduction\nfor a condensate, K3 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u221241 m6 /s, which leads to a\nnegligible loss event probability 13 |dN/dt|ttrans \u2248 0.03.\nIn present experiments the number of atoms N fluctuates from one realization to the other around the desired\nmean value N\u0304 . Since the launch velocity ~K0 /M is fixed,\nK0 is proportional to N and also fluctuates [25]. A first\nside effect is that the half-transmission probability condition may be violated away from N = N\u0304 ; fortunately\nthis is not the case for a broad barrier b \u226b \u03be, since both\nterms of (11) are proportional to N . A second side effect\nis that the fringe spacing \u03c0/K0 will fluctuate, which will\nblur the fringes. A simple way to estimate this is to as2\n2\nsume that |\u03a6(X)|2 \u221d |eiK0 X + e\u2212iK0 X |2 e\u2212X /2\u03c3 at the\noverlap time. Averaging over a Poisson distribution for\nN with \u03c3 and K0 /N fixed leads to, for |X| \u226a \u03c0 N\u0304 /K\u03040 :\nh|\u03a6(X)|2 i \u2243\n\n2\n2\ni\ne\u2212X /2\u03c3 h\n\u2212X 2 /2\u03c3c2\n1\n+\ne\ncos(2\nK\u0304\nX)\n.\n0\n(2\u03c0)1/2 \u03c3\n\nThe fringes persist\n\u221a around the origin over a distance \u03c3c =\nN\u0304 1/2 /(2K\u03040 ) = 2\u03be. |s(2K\u03040 )| is then reduced by a factor \u03c3c /(\u03c3 2 + \u03c3c2 )1/2 . Estimating \u03c3 from Fig.1 leads to a\nreduction factor 5 close to the numerical one (see Fig.1).\nIn conclusion, we propose to produce a coherently bilocalized gas by scattering an atomic quantum soliton on a\nbarrier. We have performed a detailed analysis of this\nidea, which raises challenging experimental aspects of\npreparation and detection, but also non trivial theoretical aspects since this is a many-body problem. We find\n\nthat a gas with N \u2243 100 7 Li atoms can be prepared in a\ncoherent superposition of being at two different locations\nseparated by \u223c 100\u03bcm, and that this can be proved by\nan interferometric measurement.\nOne of us (C.W.) acknowledges financial support from\nthe European Union (contract MEIF-CT-2006-038407).\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with A.
