Introduction.\nAlgebraic hypersurfaces with many Aj -singularities have been studied in [17] by extending a\nconstruction of S.V. Chmutov [5], who used generalizations of the Chebyshev polynomials known\nas folding polynomials [15, 22]. Chmutov constructions produce surfaces having a high number\nof nodes or A1 -singularities, although for degrees d = 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 there are examples with a\nhigher number [2, 11, 18, 21]. Nodal surfaces of several degrees have also been used to construct\ntwo-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds, also known as K3-surfaces. This is the case for the 600\nnodal Sarti dodecic, a surface having a quotient which is a K3-surface [3]. New lower bounds\nfor the number of singularities Aj on a hypersurface of degree d in the complex projective space\nPn (C) are obtained for many cases in [17].\nTwo types of simple arrangements [14] of lines \u03a31 , \u03a32 , containing the prototiles of substitution\ntilings, have been introduced in [10]. Real variants of Chmutov surfaces [4] can be derived\nwith the folding polynomials defined as products of lines in \u03a31 . The mirror symmetric simple\narrangements \u03a32 , \u03a3\u03042 , with cyclic symmetries C3 , have one more triangle than \u03a31 , and this\nproperty can be used to construct surfaces with more singularities. This is due to the fact that\nthe corresponding polynomials have the same extreme values (-1 for all the minima and 8 for\nthe maxima) in all the critical points with critical value of the same sign, which on the other\nhand coincide with those of the real folding polynomials constructed with \u03a31 . The triangular\nshapes appearing in the simple arrangements are the prototiles of substitution tilings, derived\nwith a general construction based on simplicial arrangements of lines [7]. A wide variety of tiling\nspaces can be defined having different types of topological invariants [8, 9], which are significant\nin several contexts, like the study of the energy gaps in the spectrum of the Schroedinger\n\n\fequation with tiling equivariant potentials. In this work, the construction of new types of\nhypersurfaces with many Aj -singularities is done with the polynomials associated with \u03a32 and\n\u03a3\u03042 . Mathematica [23], Singular [13] and Surfer [6, 16] computing and geometric visualization\ntools are used.\n2. Surfaces with many A1 -singularities\nLet TdC (w) \u2208 R[w] be the Chebyshev polynomial of degree d with critical values -1,+1 and\nFd (u, v) the folding polynomials associated to the system of roots A2 . An explicit formula\nfor the folding polynomials of degree d, which are symmetric (Fd (u, v) = Fd (v, u)) with real\ncoefficients, is Fd (u, v) = 2 + jd (u, v) + jd (v, u), where\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\njd (u, v) = det \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nu\n2v\n3\n0\n0\n...\n...\n0\n\n1\nu\nv\n1\n0\n...\n...\n...\n\n0\n1\nu\nv\n1\n...\n...\n...\n\n0\n0\n1\nu\nv\n...\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\nu\n...\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n...\nv\n1\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n0..\n...\nu\nv\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\nu\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nChmutov constructs surfaces Chd (u, v, w) := Fd (u, v) + (TdC (w) + 1)/2 having many nodes.\nIn [4] it is shown that the Chmutov construction can be adapted to give only real singularities.\nThe real folding polynomials Fd (x, y) are obtained when u = x + iy, v = u\u2217 = x \u2212 iy. The plane\ncurve Fd (x, y) is a product of d lines in simple arrangements \u03a31 having critical points with only\nthree different critical values: 0,-1 and 8. The surface Chd (x, y, z) is singular exactly at the\npoints where the critical values \u03b6 of Fd (x, y) and (TdC (z) + 1)/2 are either both zero, or one is\n-1 and the other +1.\n\u0001\nThe polynomials Fd (x, y) have d2 real critical points with value \u03b6 = 0 and, when d \u2208 Z3 ,\n1 2\n3 d \u2212 d real critical points with \u03b6 = \u22121. The other critical points also have real coordinates and\ncritical value \u03b6 = 8. The number of maxima can then be obtained by applying the following\nLemma 1. [19, 4] Let f be a real simple line arrangement consisting in d \u2265 3 lines. f has\n\u0001\nexactly d\u22121\nbounded open cells each of which contains exactly one critical point. All the\n2\ncritical points of f are non-degenerate.\nIt is possible to construct polynomials for some degrees with one more critical point with\n\u03b6 = \u22121. For m = 3q, q = 1, 2, 3, ... the simple arrangement \u03a3\u03042 consists in the lines L\u0304k,m (x, y) = 0,\nwith\nk\u03c0\nk\u03c0\nk\u03c0\nL\u0304k,m (x, y) := y \u2212 (cos\n\u2212 x)tan\n\u2212 sin\n(1)\n3m\n6m\n3m\nwhere k \u2208 Z and L\u03043m,m (x, y) = 0 is interpreted as the line x = \u22121. The polynomials obtained\nwith L\u0304k,m (x, y) are defined as\nC\nJ \u0304m\n(x, y) := 3\n\n1\u2212(\u22121)m\n4\n\n(\u22121)b\n\nq+1\nc+1\n2\n\nm\u22121\nY\n\nL\u03046\u03bd+1,m (x, y) \u2208 R[x, y]\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bd=0\nC (x, y) = J \u0304C (x, \u2212y). They have only three different critical values: 0,-1, 8, and by\nand Jm\nm\nC (x, y), we get\nchanging the variables x = (u + v)/2, y = i(v \u2212 u)/2 in Jm\nC\nC\nC\u2217\n(u, v) = \u22121 + jm\n(u, v) + jm\n(u, v)\nJm\n\n\fC (u, v) has now complex coefficients. The polynomials corresponding to d = 3, 6, 9, are\nwhere jm\n\n3\nj3C (u, v) = \u2212bu3 + uv,\n2\n9\nj6C (u, v) = (2 \u2212 8b)u3 \u2212 bu6 + 6uv + 6bu4 v \u2212 u2 v 2 ,\n2\nj9C (u, v) = (9 \u2212 27b)u3 \u2212 9bu6 \u2212 bu9 +\n\n27\nuv \u2212 (9 \u2212 54b)u4 v + 9bu7 v \u2212 27u2 v 2 \u2212 27bu5 v 2 + 15u3 v 3 ,\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\nC (v, u) are not symmetric and\nwith b = e\u2212i 3 . In contrast with Fd (u, v), the polynomials Jm\nC (u, v) := J C (u\u2217 , v \u2217 ) = J C (v, u). The surfaces with affine equations [10]\nJ \u0304m\nm\nm\nC\nQC\nm (x, y, z) := Jm (x, y) +\n\n(\u22121)m+1 C\n(Jm (z, 0) \u2212 1 + (\u22121)m+1 2) = 0\n4\n\n(3)\n\nhave a number of real nodes, or A1 -singularities, higher than the real variants of the Chmutov\nsurfaces with the same degree. The first surface in the series defined by Eq.(3) is equivalent\nto the Cayley cubic, a well known example having four ordinary double points, the maximum\npossible number in degree 3. The Chmutov surface of the same degree has three nodes.\n3. Hypersurfaces with many Aj -singularities.\n2\n2\n2\nAn Aj -singularity on a hypersurface in Pn (C) has the local equation xj+1\n0 +x1 +x2 +...+xn\u22121 = 0.\nC (x, y) and J \u0304C (x, y) can be used for the construction of hypersurfaces with\nThe polynomials Jm\nm\nmany Aj -singularities.\n\nFigure 1.\nPlane trees for Belyi polynomials.(a)The two types of substitution rules. (b)\n2 (z), q = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, obtained by applying alternatively the\nPlane trees corresponding to B\u03043q\nsubstitutions to the right most vertex.\nA polynomial in one variable with no more than two different critical values is called a Belyi\npolynomial. The proof of its existence is based on the theory of Dessins d \u0301Enfants. A graph\n\n\fwithout cycles with a prescribed cyclic order of the edges adjacent to each vertex is called a\nplane tree [1]. A plane tree has a natural bicoloring of the vertices. For any plane tree, there\nexists a Belyi polynomial whose critical points have the multiplicities given by the number of\nedges adjacent to the vertices minus one and viceversa. Degree-d Chebyshev polynomials are\nthe Belyi polynomials whose plane tree has the form of the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra\n2 (z) (see Appendix\nAd+1 . The plane trees of a family of Belyi polynomials that we denote by B\u03043q\nB), can be obtained by a substitution process as indicated in Fig.1. After the first step, which\nis given in the left part of Fig.1a, we apply alternatively to the right most white vertex, the\ntwo substitution rules given in Fig.1a. The next four steps, corresponding to q = 2, 3, 4, 5 are\nshown in Fig.1b. The generalization of the Chmutov \u0301s construction given in [17] for the study\nof singularities of type Aj in P3 (C) consists in considering surfaces with affine equations\nFd (x, y) + Gjd (z) = 0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Gjd (z) are Belyi polynomials. In general there is no explicit formula for them, and they\ncan be computed only for low degree d by using Groebner basis. However, in some cases, there\nare explicit expressions that can be obtained from classical Jacobi polynomials Pkl,m (z) [20] by\nstudying the three-parameter family of polynomials\na/c,\u2212b\n\nGa,b,c (z) = z a Pb\u22121\n\n(1 \u2212 2z)c\n\n(5)\n\nThe order of a zero z0 of dPdz(z) , which is a critical point of P (z) with critical value \u03b6 = P (z0 ),\nis called its multipicity \u03bd (all the derivatives of P (z) up to order \u03bd vanish at z0 ). The zeros of\ndGa,b,c\nwith critical value \u03b6 = 0 have orders \u03bd = a \u2212 1, c \u2212 1, ..., c \u2212 1, while the unique remaining\ndz\nroot r = 1 has \u03bd = b \u2212 1 with critical value \u03b6 = 1.\nWe denote by \u03bcAj the number of Aj \u2212singularities (\u03bcAj (d) if we want to specify the degree\nC (x, y) or J \u0304C (x, y) in Eq.(4) we can get in some cases surfaces\nd). If we replace F3q (x, y) by J3q\n3q\nwith a higher \u03bcAj . In what follows, we use Ga,b,c (z) in order to give explicit expressions for\nsome singular surfaces. Even when the number of singularities of a given type is equal to the\none obtained in [17], the surfaces show a higher number of other types. The lines L\u0304k,m (x, y) = 0\nand L\u0304l,m (x, y) = 0, where\nL\u0304k,m (x, y) = y + tk,m x \u2212 Bk,m\n\n(6)\n\nk\u03c0\nwith tk,m = tan 6m\n, Bk,m = (3tk,m \u2212 t3k,m )/(1 + t2k,m ), intersect in the point\n\n(\n\nBk,m \u2212 Bl,m Bl,m tk,m \u2212 Bk,m tl,m\n,\n)\ntk,m \u2212 tl,m\ntk,m \u2212 tl,m\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is denoted, for a given m, by pk\u2229l .\nProposition 1. The surfaces J6C (x, y) + G2,2,4 (z) = 0 in P3 (R) have \u03bcA1 = 22 and \u03bcA3 = 15.\nIn P4 (R) the three-fold J6C (x0 , x1 ) \u2212 J6C (x2 , x3 ) = 0 has \u03bcA1 = 283.\nProof. The points corresponding to the minima of J6C (x, y) are, up to three-fold rotation,\np0\u22296 , p0\u222912 , p2\u22298 with critical value \u03b6 = \u22121 and the maximum with critical value \u03b6 = 8 is in\np4\u222910 . Except for the minima situated at the origin (p0\u222912 in this case), the action of the cyclic\ngroup C3 gives the remaining distinct critical points for this and the examples that follows. By\nrepresenting the points in the plane by complex numbers, we find that the minima are in\n0, \u03b1, r\u03b1, r2 \u03b1, 2, 2r, 2r2\n\n\f\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nwhere \u03b1 = ei 9 , r = ei 3 .

We notice that J15\n3,4,4 (z) = 0 has one more A3 singularity than the surfaces with the same degree having the highest known \u03bcA3 [17]. Continuing\nalong this lines, degree-3q surfaces in P3 (R) with singularities of type A2q\u22121 , q = 1, 2, ... can be\nC (x, y) or J \u0304C (x, y).\nobtained by adding Gq,2,2q (z) to Jm\nm\nC (x, y):\nNodal hypersurfaces in Pn (R) can be constructed also with the help of Jm\nb n\u22122\nc\n2\n\nX\nk=0\n\nC\n(\u22121)k Jm\n(x2k , x2k+1 ) =\n\n(\u22121)m+n + (\u22121)m+1 C\n(Jm (xn\u22121 , 0) \u2212 1 + (\u22121)m+1 2)\n8\n\n(8)\n\nFor instance J6C (x0 , x1 ) \u2212 J6C (x2 , x3 ) = 41 (3 \u2212 J6C (x4 , 0)) in P5 (R) has 1059 nodes. These can be\ncomputed having in mind the results in Prop.1 and the fact that 41 (3 \u2212 J6C (x4 , 0)) has 3 critical\npoints with \u03b6 = 0 and 2 critical points with \u03b6 = 1.\n\n\fThe methods given above can be extended in order to construct hypersurfaces in Pn (C), n > 4\nwith many Aj -singularities, by using Ga,b,c (xn\u22121 ) instead of the right-hand side of Eq.(8). In\nthis way we get, for example, the hypersurface J6C (x0 , x1 ) \u2212 J6C (x2 , x3 ) = G2,2,4 (x4 ) in P5 (R)\nwith 388 nodes and 283 A3 -singularities.\nThere is a dynamical formulation in terms of a uniparametric family of line configurations [9]\nwhich can be used to get deformations of the surfaces, where some singularities disappear and\nothers arise. It gives a way to transform the surfaces based on \u03a31 into the surfaces based on \u03a32\nand \u03a3\u03042 , representing a topology change that would correspond to a kind of phase transition in\na physical context.\nWe have studied hypersurfaces with a high number of singularities, improving the known\nlower bounds in some cases. Open questions that should be addressed are the search of maximal\nsimple arrangements of lines giving polynomials with the same critical values, and deformations\nof the surfaces to get others with new types of singularities.\n\nFigure 2.\nExamples with real singularities: a) A degree 6 surface with \u03bcA1 = 22 and\n\u03bcA3 = 15.b) A nonic surface with \u03bcA1 = 19 and \u03bcA2 = \u03bcA5 = 36. c) A nonic with \u03bcA4 = 55.\n\n4.

Lexicographical and degree reverse lexicographical monomial\nordering are denoted by lp, dp, and vdim(std(I)) is the vector space dimension of the ring\nmodulo de ideal I. Short input is used (e.g. 3x2 \u2212 x3 is denoted by 3x2 \u2212 x3).

In a similar way, if we analyze f = J9C (x, y) + G3,3,3 (z),\nwe get \u03c4 = 254, which corresponds to a surface with 127 cusps as in Prop.2.\n5. APPENDIX B: Belyi polynomials.\nIn this appendix we obtain several Belyi polynomials.

We notice that B\u030492 (z) has complex coefficients even if we take u \u2208 R. It\nhas the same planar tree as G3,3,3 (z) in Prop.2, but the polynomial derived from the classical\nJacobi polynomial is simpler.\nThe surfaces J9C (x, y) + G29 (z) = 0, with G29 (z) = (B92 (z) + 1)/2 and G29 (z) = (B\u030492 (z) + 1)/2,\nC (x, y)+(B\u0304 2 (z)+1)/2 = 0 have b 3q\u22121 c\u2212b 3q c\nhave 110 and 127 cusps respectively. The surfaces J3q\n3q\n2\n3\nmore cusps than those constructed in [17] with Fd (x, y).\nC (x, y).
