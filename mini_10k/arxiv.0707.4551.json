Previously we suggested a new preon model of composite quark-leptons and\nf6 gauge symmetry group. We assumed that preons are\nbosons with the 'flipped' E6 \u00d7 E\ndyons having both hyper-electric g and hyper-magnetic g\u0303 charges, and these preons-dyons\nare confined by hyper-magnetic strings which are an N = 1 supersymmetric non-Abelian\nflux tubes created by the condensation of spreons near the Planck scale. In the present paper\nwe show that the existence of the three types of strings with tensions Tk = kT0 (k = 1, 2, 3)\nproducing three (and only three) generations of composite quark-leptons, also provides three\ngenerations of composite gauge bosons ('hyper-gluons') and, as a consequence, predicts the\nfamily replicated [E6 ]3 unification at the scale \u223c 1017 GeV. This group of unification has\nthe possibility of breaking to the group of symmetry: [SU (3)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)Y ]3 \u00d7\n[U (1)(B\u2212L) ]3 which undergoes the breakdown to the Standard Model at lower energies.\nSome predictive advantages of the family replicated gauge groups of symmetry are briefly\ndiscussed.\nKey words: preon; dyon; monopole; unification; E6\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 81T10; 81T13; 81V22\n\n1\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\nMultiple point principle and AntiGUT\n\nUp to the present time the vast majority of the available experimental information in high energy\nphysics is essentially explained by the Standard Model (SM). The gauge symmetry group in the\nSM is:\nSM G = SU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y .\n\n(1)\n\nAll accelerator physics is in agreement with the SM, except for neutrino oscillations. Presently\nonly this neutrino physics, together with astrophysics and cosmology, gives us any phenomenological evidence for going beyond the SM.\nThe experiment confirms the existence of three generations (families) of quarks and leptons in\nthe SM. If there exists also one right-handed neutrino per family, then the SM contains 48 fermion\nfields and could be described by the enormous global group SU (48) \u00d7 U (1). But Nature chooses\nonly small subgroups of this global group. The answer is given by simple principles (see for\nexample [1]): the resulting theory has to be (i) free from anomalies, and (ii) free from bare\n\u22c6\nThis paper is a contribution to the Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference \"Symmetry in\nNonlinear Mathematical Physics\" (June 24\u201330, 2007, Kyiv, Ukraine).

But the largest semi-simple groups\nalso are possible.\nThe extension of the SM with the family replicated gauge group (FRGG):\nG = (SM G)3 = SM G \u00d7 SM G \u00d7 SM G = [SU (3)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)Y ]3\n\n(2)\n\nwas suggested in [2, 3] (see also review [4]). The appearance of heavy right-handed neutrinos at\nMSS \u2248 1015 GeV was described by the generalized FRGG-model [5, 6, 7, 8]:\nGext = [SM G \u00d7 U(B\u2212L) (1)]3 = [SU (3)Y ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)Y ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)(B\u2212L) ]3 .\n\n(3)\n\nIt was assumed that any new physics appears only near the Planck scale. Such a \"desert\nscenario\" was accompanied by the Multiple Point Principle (MPP) suggested in [9].\nA priori it is quite possible for a quantum field theory to have several minima of its effective\npotential as a function of its scalar fields. MPP postulates: all the vacua which might exist in\nNature are degenerate and should have approximately zero vacuum energy density (cosmological\nconstant). According to the MPP, there are two vacua in the SM (and its extension) with the\nsame energy density, and all cosmological constants are zero or approximately zero [10, 11] (see\nalso review [12]) what is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe model [5, 6, 7] in conjunction with MPP [9] fits well the SM fermion masses and mixing\nangles and describes all neutrino experimental data [13] (see below Section 7). This approach\nbased on the FRGG-model was previously called Anti-Grand Unified Theory (AntiGUT).\nIn the present paper we discuss \"AntiGUT\" as a consequence of the existence of SUSY\nGUT [E6 ]3 near the Planck scale, which is predicted by our new preon model [14, 15, 16]\nproducing three generations of composite quark-leptons and bosons. By this reason, we prefer\nnot to use the name \"AntiGUT\" for the FRGG model (3) and call it simply \"FNT-model\"\n(Froggatt\u2013Nielsen\u2013Takanishi model [5, 6, 7, 13]).\n\n1.2\n\nHeterotic superstring theory E8 \u00d7 E8\u2032\n\nSuperstring theory gives the possibility to unify all fundamental gauge interactions with gravity.\nThe authors of [17, 18, 19] have shown that superstrings are free of gravitational and Yang\u2013\nMills anomalies if the superstring theory is described by the gauge group of symmetry SO(32)\nor E8 \u00d7 E8 . A more realistic candidate for unification is the \"heterotic\" superstring theory\nE8 \u00d7 E8\u2032 suggested in [20, 21, 22]. This ten-dimensional Yang\u2013Mills theory can undergo a compactification. The integration over six compactified dimensions leads to the effective theory\nwith E6 gauge group of symmetry in four dimensions. The group E8 is broken, but E8\u2032 remains unbroken and plays the role of a hidden sector in SUGRA. As a result, we obtain the E6\nSUSY-GUT in the four-dimensional space.\n\n\fPreon Model and Family Replicated E6 Unification\n\n2\n\n3\n\nA new preon model of composite particles\n\nIn this paper, as in [14, 15, 16], we present a new model of preons making composite quarkleptons and (gauge and Higgs) bosons described by the three types of supersymmetric 'flipped'\nE6 gauge groups of unification.\nf6 . Here E6 is a non-dual sector\nWe start with the 'flipped' supersymmetric group E6 \u00d7 E\nf6 is a dual sector with the hyper-magnetic\nof theory with the hyper-electric charge g, and E\ncharge g\u0303.\n\n2.1\n\nPreons are dyons confined by hyper-magnetic strings\n\nThe main idea of our investigations, published in [14, 15, 16], is an assumption that preons are\ndyons confined by hyper-magnetic strings which are created by the condensation of spreons near\nthe Planck scale.\nJ. Pati first suggested [23, 24] to use the strong U (1) magnetic forces to bind preons-dyons\nin composite objects. This idea is extended in our model in the light of recent investigations of\ncomposite non-Abelian flux tubes in SQCD [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].\nf6 gauge theory for preons in 4DConsidering the N = 1 supersymmetric flipped E6 \u00d7 E\ndimensional space-time, we assume that preons P and antipreons P c are dyons with charges\n(ng, mg\u0303) and (\u2212ng, \u2212mg\u0303), respectively, residing in the 4D hypermultiplets:\nH = (P, P c )\nand\nH\u0303 = (P\u0303 , P\u0303 c ).\nf6 . We assume that the dual sector E\nf6\nHere \"P\u0303 \" designates spreons, but not the belonging to E\ne\nis broken in our world for \u03bc \u2264 \u03bc\u0303crit (where \u03bc is the energy scale) to some group G.\nAs a result, near the Planck scale preons and spreons transform under the hyper-electric gauge\ne according to their fundamental representations:\ngroup E6 and hyper-magnetic gauge group G\n\u0001\nP, P\u0303 \u223c (27, N ),\nP c , P\u0303 c \u223c 27, N ,\n\ne group.

We assume that\nLet us consider now the breakdown of E6 and E\nHiggses belonging to the 78-dimensional representation of E6 lead to the following breakdown:\nE6 \u2192 SU (6) \u00d7 SU (2) \u2192 SU (6) \u00d7 U (1),\n\n\fPreon Model and Family Replicated E6 Unification\n\n5\n\nwhere SU (6) \u00d7 U (1) is the largest relevant invariance group of the 78 [33]. Below we shall show\nthat just this breakdown provides the spreon condensation and existence of the second vacuum.\nIn this investigation, in contrast to our previous papers [14, 15], we suggest to consider several\ntypes of possible chains for the SM extension by family replicated gauge groups leading to the\n[E6 ]3 unification near the scale \u223c 1017 GeV (according to the predictions of superstrings [17]).\nThe chain (explained by the FNT-model [5, 6, 7, 13]):\nSU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y \u2192 SU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Z \u00d7 U (1)X\n\u2192 [SU (3)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)Z ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)X ]3\n\n(4)\n\n1) can be extended by 'flipped' models [34]:\n\u2192 [SU (5) \u00d7 U (1)X ]3 \u2192 [SU (5) \u00d7 U (1)Z1 \u00d7 U (1)X1 ]3\n\u2192 [SO(10) \u00d7 U (1)X1 ]3 \u2192 [E6 ]3 ,\n\n(5)\n\n2) or by three ways connected with the left-right symmetry [35, 36, 37]:\n\u2192 [SU (4)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)R ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)Z ]3\n\u2192 [SO(10) \u00d7 U (1)Z ]3 \u2192 [E6 ]3 ,\n3\n\n3\n\n(6)\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\u2192 [SU (4)C ] \u00d7 [SU (2)L ] \u00d7 [SU (2)R ] \u00d7 [U (1)Z ]\n\u2192 [SU (6) \u00d7 SU (2)R ]3 \u2192 [E6 ]3 ,\n3\n\n3\n\n(7)\n3\n\n\u2192 [SU (3)C ] \u00d7 [SU (2)L ] \u00d7 [SU (2)R ] \u00d7 [U (1)X ] \u00d7 [U (1)Z ]\n\u2192 [SU (3)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (3)L ]3 \u00d7 [SU (3)R ]3 \u2192 [E6 ]3 .\n\n(8)\n\nIn the present paper we have investigated only the case 1) of the 'flipped' models. We\nhave chosen this case with the aim to obtain a minimum of the effective potential at the scale\n\u223c 1018 GeV (see below Section 6).\nWe have assumed as an Example 5 of [34] the breakdown of each supersymmetric 'flipped'\nSU (5) \u00d7 U (1)X to the non-supersymmetric gauge group SU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Z \u00d7 U (1)X\nat the scale \u223c 1015 GeV, using the condensates of the Higgs bosons belonging to the 5h + 5\u0304h ,\n10H +10H , 15H \u2032 +15H \u2032 and 24-dimensional adjoint A representations of the flipped SU (5). Then\nthe final unification group is the flipped [E6 ]3 at the scale \u223c 1017 GeV. It is obvious that in this\ncase each E6 is broken to SO(10) \u00d7 U (1)X1 by condensates of the Higgs bosons belonging to the\n27h + 27h , 351H + 351H , 351\u2032 H \u2032 + 351\u2032 H \u2032 and 78-dimensional adjoint A representations of the\nflipped E6 . In the intermediate region we have the condensates of the Higgs bosons belonging\nto the 10h + 1\u03040h , 45H + 45H , 54H \u2032 + 54H \u2032 and 45-dimensional adjoint A representations of the\nflipped SO(10).\nFig. 3 presents a qualitative description of the running of the inverse coupling constants\n\u22121\n\u03b1i (x) near the Planck scale predicted by the case 1) of our model in the one-loop approximation\nof the above-mentioned Example 5 of [34]. Here for \u03b1i = gi2 /4\u03c0 index i corresponds to the\ngroups (4) and (5): i = 1, 2, 3, X, Z, X1, Z1, 5, 10; x = log10 \u03bc(GeV), and \u03bc is the energy scale.\nOf course, we must understand that the one-loop approximation running of \u03b1\u22121\ni (x) is not\nvalid in the non-perturbative region AB. Two points A and B, shown in Fig. 3, correspond\n(see [14, 15]): 1) to the scale Mcrit of the breakdown E6 \u2192 SU (6) \u00d7 U (1) (point A), and 2) to\n^\n]\nfcrit of the breakdown E\nf6 \u2192 SU\nthe scale M\n(6) \u00d7 U\n(1) (point B). We see that near the scale\nMC \u2248 1018 GeV there exists just the theory of non-Abelian flux tubes, which was developed\nrecently in [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In contrast to [14, 15, 16], it is necessary to choose MC < MP l\nwith the aim not to come in conflict with gravity.\n\n\f6\n\nC.R. Das and L.V.

The figure provides a qualitative description of the running of \u03b1\u22121 (x) near the Planck scale\npredicted by the present preon model. The family replicated gauge group of symmetry [E6 ]3 exists in\nthe region of energies MSSG \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 Mcrit . The point A at the scale of energy \u03bc = Mcrit indicates\nfcrit\nthat hyper-electric preon strings exist for \u03bc \u2265 Mcrit. The point B corresponds to the scale \u03bc = M\nf\nand indicates that hyper-magnetic preon strings exist for \u03bc \u2264 Mcrit . The curve AB corresponds to the\nregion of spreon condensation, where we have both hyper-electric and hyper-magnetic strings. The point\nfcrit we have the running of \u03b1\u22121 (x) for\nC corresponds to the second vacuum of our theory. For \u03bc \u2265 M\nmonopolic \"quark-leptons\", but gravity (SUGRA) transforms the trans-Planckian region. We assume\nthat our theory is valid only up to the scale \u223c 1018 GeV (point C).\n\nWe assume the condensation of spreons near the scale MC . One can combine the Z6 center\nof SU (6) with the elements exp(i\u03c0) \u2208 U (1) to get topologically stable string solutions possessing\nboth windings, in SU (6) and U (1). Henceforth, we assume the existence of a dual sector of the\n^\n]\ntheory described by SU\n(6) \u00d7 U\n(1), which is responsible for hyper-magnetic fluxes. Then we\nhave a nontrivial homotopy group:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nSU (6) \u00d7 U (1)\n= Z6 ,\n\u03c01\nZ6\nand flux lines form topologically non-trivial Z6 strings.\nBesides SU (6) and U (1) gauge bosons, the model contains thirty six scalar fields charged\n]\n^\nwith respect to U (1) and U\n(1) which belong to the 6-plets of SU (6) and SU\n(6). Considering\nscalar fields of spreons\n\b\nP\u0303 = \u03c6aA ,\na, A = 1, 2, . . . , 6,\n\nwe construct their condensation in the vacuum:\nP\u0303vac = P\u0303 aA = v * diag(1, 1, . . . , 1),\n\na, A = 1, . . . , 6.\n\nThe vacuum expectation value (VEV) v is given in [25] as\np\nv = \u03be \u226b \u039b4 ,\n\n\fPreon Model and Family Replicated E6 Unification\n\n7\n\nwhere \u03be is the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos D-term parameter in the N = 1 supersymmetric theory and \u039b4\nis its 4-dimensional scale. In our case:\nv \u223c MC \u223c 1018 GeV,\nbecause spreons are condensed near the scale MC .\nNon-trivial topology amounts to the winding of elements of the matrix\n\b\nP\u0303 = \u03c6aA ,\na, A = 1, 2, . . . , 6,\nand we obtain string solutions of the type:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP\u0303string = v * diag ei\u03b1(x) , ei\u03b1(x) , . . . , 1, 1 ,\n\nwhere\n\nx \u2192 \u221e.\n\nAssuming the existence of a preon P (or spreon P\u0303 ) and antipreon P c (antispreon P\u0303 c ) at the\nends of strings with hyper-magnetic charges ng\u0303 and \u2212ng\u0303, respectively, we obtain the six types\nof strings having their fluxes \u03a6n quantized according to the Z6 center group of SU (6) [20]:\n\u03a6n = n\u03a60 ,\n\nn = \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13.\n\nThe string tensions of these non-Abelian flux tubes were also calculated. The minimal tension is:\nT0 = 2\u03c0\u03be,\nwhich in our preon model is equal to:\nT0 = 2\u03c0v 2 \u223c 1036 GeV2 .\nSuch an enormously large tension means that preonic strings have almost infinitely small \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0,\nwhere \u03b1\u2032 = 1/(2\u03c0T0 ) is the slope of trajectories in the string theory.\nThe six types of preonic flux tubes oriented in opposite directions give us the three types of\npreonic k-strings having the following tensions:\nTk = k * T0 ,\n\nwhere k = 1, 2, 3.\n\nThen hyper-magnetic charges of preons (spreons) and antipreons (antispreons) are confined by\nthree types of string.\nAlso preonic strings are extremely thin. It was shown in [14, 15] that the radius Rstr of the\nflux tubes is very small: Rstr \u223c 10\u221218 GeV\u22121 .\n\n4\n\nOrigin of three generations\n\nWe have obtained three, and only three, generations of fermions and bosons in the superstringinspired 'flipped' E6 model of preons. This number \"3\" is explained by the existence of just three\nvalues of hyper-magnetic flux tubes which bind the hyper-magnetic charges of preons-dyons. At\nthe ends of the preonic strings there are placed hyper-magnetic charges:\n\u00b1g\u03030 ,\n\nor\n\n\u00b1 2g\u03030 ,\n\nor\n\n\u00b1 3g\u03030 ,\n\nwhere g\u03030 is the minimal hyper-magnetic charge. Then all the bound states form three generations: for example, three 27-plets of E6 corresponding to the three different tube fluxes. We have\nobtained a specific type of \"horizontal symmetry\" explaining flavor. It was shown in [14, 15]\nthat the model explains the hierarchy of the SM masses naturally.\n\n\f8\n\nC.R. Das and L.V. Laperashvili\n\nFigure 4. Vector gauge bosons belonging to the 78 representation of the flipped E6 and Higgs scalars \u2013\nsinglets of E6 \u2013 are composite objects created (a) by fermionic preons P , P c and (b) by scalar spreons\nP\u0303s , P\u0303sc . Both of them are confined by hyper-magnetic strings.\n\nWe also have obtained three types of gauge boson Ai\u03bc (where i = 1, 2, 3 is the generation\nindex) belonging to the 27 \u00d7 27 = 1 + 78 + 650 representations of E6 .\nFig. 4 illustrates the formation of such hyper-gluons (Fig. 4(a)) and also hyper-Higgses\n(Fig. 4(b)).\nThe existence of three generations of hyper-gluons predicts the family replicated [E6 ]3 unification near the scale \u223c 1017 GeV. Here the number of families is equal to the number of generations:\nNfam = Ngen = 3. The dynamical assumption of the three families in our preon model is based\non the existence of the three types of flux tubes (\"strings\") connecting preons-dyons in the three\n(and only three) types of hyper-gluons which create just the [E6 ]3 unification.\n\n5\n\nFamily replicated [E6 ]3 unif ication\n\nThe illustrative picture given in Fig. 3 presents the existence of [E6 ]3 unification in the region\nof energies MSSG \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 Mcrit , where the unification scale MSSG \u2248 1017 GeV.\nHere it is necessary to distinguish E6 gauge symmetry group for preons from E6 for quarkleptons. The points A and B of Fig. 3 respectively correspond to the breakdown of [E6 ]3\nf6 ]3 in the region AB of spreon condensation. In that region we have the breakdown of\nand [E\nf6 ):\nthe preon (one family) E6 (or E\n\u0010\n\u0011\n^\n]\nf6 \u2192 SU\nE6 \u2192 SU (6) \u00d7 U (1)\nor E\n(6) \u00d7 U\n(1) .\n\nFig. 3 shows that the group E6 is broken in the region of energies \u03bc \u2265 Mcrit producing hyperfcrit ) corresponding\nelectric strings between preons. The point A (B) indicates the scale Mcrit (M\nf6 ). At the point B hyper-magnetic strings are produced and exist in\nto the breakdown of E6 (E\nfcrit confining hyper-magnetic charges of preons. As a result, in the\nthe region of energies \u03bc \u2264 M\nfcrit\nregion \u03bc \u2264 Mcrit we see quark-leptons with hyper-electric charges, but in the region \u03bc \u2265 M\nmonopolic \"quark-leptons\" \u2013 particles with hyper-magnetic charges \u2013 may exist. However, in\nthis region which is close to MP l , our theory is not correct: gravity (SUGRA) begins to work,\nand monopoles are absent in our world.\nThe dotted curve in Fig. 3 describes the running of \u03b1\u22121 (\u03bc) for monopolic \"quark-leptons\"\ncreated by preons which are bound by supersymmetric hyper-electric non-Abelian flux tubes.\nThe curve AB corresponds to the region of spreon condensation, where we have both hyperelectric and hyper-magnetic strings. The point C corresponds to the second vacuum of our\nfcrit we have the running of monopole coupling constant. The corresponding\ntheory. For \u03bc \u2265 M\n\u22121\n\u03b1 (x) is shown in Fig. 3 by the dotted curve. But our theory is valid only up to the scale\n\u223c 1018 GeV (point C of Fig. 3). Gravity (SUGRA) transforms the trans-Planckian region, and\nwe do not know anything about the behavior of theory in the region of dotted curve.\n\n\fPreon Model and Family Replicated E6 Unification\n\n5.1\n\n9\n\nThe breakdown of [E6 ]3 to the FNT-model\n\nIn general, it is quite possible to obtain the FNT-model considering the chain (4), (5) of the\n'flipped' models at lower energies.\nWe may assume the breakdown of the supersymmetric 'flipped' [SU (5)]3 to the non-supersymmetric FRGG:\n[SU (3)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)Z ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)X ]3\n\n(9)\n\nat the scale \u223c 1015 GeV, what was shown in Fig. 3. Then the final unification group is the\nflipped [E6 ]3 at the scale MSSG \u2248 1017 GeV.\nWith the aim to confirm the FNT-model scenario [5, 6, 7, 13], we must assume that the\nchain (5) from [SU (5)]3 to [E6 ]3 is realized in the very narrow interval of energies. For example,\nin contrast to Fig. 3, we can consider the breakdown of the supersymmetric 'flipped' [SU (5)]3 to\nthe non-supersymmetric FRGG (9) at the scale \u223c 1017 GeV, assuming that MSSG \u2248 1017.5 GeV.\nShortly speaking, the group of unification [E6 ]3 undergoes an almost direct breakdown to the\nFRGG group (9).\nAs we have mentioned previously, the condensation of spreons near the scale MC predicts the\nexistence of a second minimum of the effective potential at the scale \u03bc \u223c 1018 GeV (see Fig. 1),\naccording to the Multiple Point Principle [9, 10, 11, 12].\n\n6\n\nMinimum of the ef fective potential near the Planck scale\n\nIt is not easy to guess how Nature can choose its path from the SM to the Planck scale. Different\npaths essentially depend on the fact whether the intermediate symmetry groups show asymptotically free or asymptotically unfree (or depressed) behavior of running gauge couplings. Such\na behavior is connected with the number of representations of the Higgs bosons providing the\nbreaking of the intermediate symmetry gauge groups down to the SM (what was considered in\nSection 3 for SU (5) and SO(10) groups of the chain (5)).\nIn our preon model the condensation of spreons is possible only if we have a minimum of the\neffective potential near the Planck scale. Not each of the paths (4)\u2013(8) can give such a minimum.\nThe paths (6)\u2013(8) of the case 2) of Section 3 are presumably asymptotically free and do not\ngive a minimum of the effective potential. As it was shown in [34], the E6 -unification can give\nsuch a minimum for the chain (4), (5) if there exist symmetry breaking Higgs bosons belonging\nto the representations given in Section 3 by the Example 5 of [34]. This is a simplest example,\nbecause more complicated cases can be considered.\nIn the non-Abelian theory, one usually starts with a gauge field F\u03bc\u03bd (x) derivable from a potential A\u03bc (x):\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc (x) \u2212 \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd (x) + ig[A\u03bc (x), A\u03bd (x)].\nConsidering only gauge groups with the Lie algebra of SU (N ), we have:\nA\u03bc (x) = tj Aj\u03bc (x),\n\nj = 1, . . . , N 2 \u2212 1,\n\nwhere tj are the generators of SU (N ) group.\nIn general, the perturbative effective potential is given by the following expression (see [38,\n39, 40, 41]):\n(0)\n\nVeff =\n\n2\n\u03b1\u22121\neff (F ) 2\nF\n16\u03c0\n\nwith\n\nj\nF 2 \u2261 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF j\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03bc GeV)4 .\n\n(10)\n\n\f10\n\nC.R.

This minimum is given by the requirement: Veff = Veff\n= 0,\naccording to the Multiple Point Principle.\n2\n\u22121\nHere \u03b1\u22121\neff (F ) = \u03b1 (x) of our theory. However, the expression (10) is not valid in the nonperturbative region, because the non-perturbative vacuum contains a condensation of flux tubes\n(hyper-electric flux tubes in our theory of preons), according to the so called \"spaghetti vacuum\"\nby Nielsen\u2013Olesen [42]. By this reason, we subtract the contribution of the condensed fluxes\nfrom the expression (10):\n\nVeff =\n\n\u22121\n2\n2\n\u03b1\u22121\neff (F ) \u2212 \u03b1eff (F0 ) 2\nF ,\n16\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere F02 = (MC GeV)4 . From (11) we have:\nVeff (x) =\n\n\u03b1\u22121 (x) \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 (xc ) 4x\n10 .\n16\u03c0\n\nThe behavior of the effective potential Veff (x) is given in Fig. 5, where we see a second minimum\nnear the Planck scale at the point \u03bc = MC = 1018 GeV. For this minimum we have:\n\u2032\nVeff = Veff\n= 0,\n\naccording to the MPP [9, 10, 11, 12]. But at the scale MC our theory stops (it is not valid),\nand we do not know the development of our theory up to the Planck scale and further \u2013 in\ntrans-Planckian region.\n\n7\n\nFNT-model, its advantages and shortcomings\n\nIf one extends the SM with the FNT-model (3) (or with any FRGG-model) not considering its\nGUT's origin, then the theory has some problems. Such a theory\ni) would not account for the quantization of electric (or magnetic) charge, or for any quantum\nnumbers of the members in a family, without additional assumptions;\n\n\fPreon Model and Family Replicated E6 Unification\n\n11\n\nii) cannot give a prediction for the weak angle;\niii) cannot automatically possess B\u2013L as a local symmetry and the righthanded neutrinos:\nthey are put in by hand.\nBut SUSY GUTs solve these problems in a compelling manner. GUTs have a predictive\npower concerning the representations occurring in the SM. By this reason, it is useful to start\nwith a SUSY GUT theory explaining the origin of the one or another FRGG-model if we have\nindications that this model is valid. SUSY GUT [E6 ]3 predicted by our preon model can be an\nexplanation of the FNT-model.\nHowever, in a slightly broader way we could think about comparing of the two competing\ntypes of models and see how well they fit and explain the putting of representations for the\nmatter fields. Such an investigation was published for the FNT-model in [5, 6, 7, 8, 13]. It\nwas shown that 6 different Higgs fields: \u03c9, \u03c1, W , T , \u03c6W S , \u03c6B\u2212L break the FNT-model to\nthe SM. The field \u03c6W S corresponds to the Weinberg\u2013Salam Higgs field of Electroweak theory.\nIts vacuum expectation value (VEV) is fixed by the Fermi constant: h\u03c6W S i = 246 GeV, so that\nwe have only 5 free parameters \u2013 five VEVs: h\u03c9i, h\u03c1i, hW i, hT i, h\u03c6B\u2212L i to fit the experiment in\nthe framework of the SM. These five adjustable parameters were used with the aim of finding\nthe best fit to experimental data for all fermion masses and mixing angles in the SM, and also\nto explain the neutrino oscillation experiments. It is assumed that the fundamental Yukawa\ncouplings in our model are of order unity and so we make order of magnitude predictions.\nExperimental results on solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino oscillations from Sudbury\nNeutrino Observatory (SNO Collaboration) and the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration have been\nused to extract the following parameters:\n\u2206m2solar = m22 \u2212 m21 ,\n\n\u2206m2atm = m23 \u2212 m22 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8solar = tan2 \u03b812 ,\n\ntan2 \u03b8atm = tan2 \u03b823\n\nwhere m1 , m2 , m3 are the hierarchical left-handed neutrino effective masses for the three families.\nThe typical fit for the FNT-model is shown in Table 1. As we can see, the 5 parameter order\nof magnitude fit is encouraging.\nHere attention may drawn to the fact that for quite a long time now BNP-model (2) by\nBennett\u2013Nielsen\u2013Picek [2] and FNT-model have been to assume that any physics beyond the\nSM will first appear at roughly the Planck scale (see [2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 43, 44]). A justification\nfor continuing to use this so-called \"desert scenario\" could be to demonstrate that the effects\nof the U(1)(B\u2212L) gauge group associated with the appearance of heavy right-handed neutrinos\nat \u223c 1015 GeV can be neglected for our study of the values of the fine structure constants near\nthe Planck scale.\nAssuming such a desert, in earlier works invented the MPP/AntiGUT gauge group model [2,\n3, 9] for the purpose of predicting the Planck scale values of the three Standard Model Group\n(SMG) gauge couplings [2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 43, 44], these predictions were made independently\nfor the three gauge couplings of SU (3), SU (2) and U (1) gauge theories.\nAccording to the BNP-model (2), the fundamental group SM G3 undergoes spontaneous\nbreakdown to the diagonal subgroup at the energy scale \u03bc = \u03bcG \u223c 1017 GeV:\nSM G3 \u2192 SM G3diag = {g, g, g|g \u2208 SM G} \u223c\n= SM G.\nFor this diagonal subgroup (SM G)3 diag , which is identified with the usual SMG, the gauge\ncouplings are predicted to coincide with the experimental gauge group couplings at the Planck\nscale which in turn are related with critical (i.e., multiple point) couplings for SM G3 [9] as\nfollows (see also [43, 44]):\n\u22121\n\u03b1\u22121\n1,exp (\u03bcP l ) = 6\u03b11,crit ,\n\n\u22121\n\u03b1\u22121\n2,exp (\u03bcP l ) = 3\u03b12,crit ,\n\n\u22121\n\u03b1\u22121\n3,exp (\u03bcP l ) = 3\u03b13,crit .\n\n\f12\n\nC.R.

Using renormalization group\nequations (RGEs) with parameters experimentally established at the Electroweak (EW) scale, it\nis possible to extrapolate the experimental values of the three inverse running constants \u03b1\u22121\ni (\u03bc)\nfrom EW scale to the Planck scale. The precision of the LEP data allows us to make this\nextrapolation with small errors [45] even when we ignore the appearance of the U (1)(B\u2212L) group\nat the \u03bcseesaw \u223c 1015 GeV. Doing the RG extrapolation of the \u03b1\u22121\ni (\u03bc) with one Higgs doublet\nand using the assumption of no relevant new physics up to \u03bc \u2248 \u03bcP l lead to the following values\n(see the Particle Data Group results [45]):\n\u03b1\u22121\n1,exp (\u03bcP l ) \u2248 55.4 \u00b1 6,\n\n\u03b1\u22121\n2,exp (\u03bcP l ) \u2248 49.0 \u00b1 3,\n\n\u03b1\u22121\n3,exp (\u03bcP l ) \u2248 53.0 \u00b1 3.\n\n(12)\n\nIn [2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 43, 44] BNP-model gives an explanation of these values of the SM coupling\nconstants existing near the Planck scale.\nAlso it is necessary to emphasize that FRGG models are extremely useful for the existence of\nmonopoles in our Universe. Values (12) mean that monopoles are absent in the SM: they have\na huge magnetic charge and are completely confined or screened. Supersymmetry does not help\nto see monopoles.\nIn theories with the FRGG-symmetry the charge of monopoles g\u0303i (\u03b1\u0303 = g\u0303 2 /4\u03c0) is essentially\ndiminished. FRGGs of type [SU (N )]Nfam lead to the lowering of the magnetic charge of the\nmonopole belonging to one family:\n\u03b1\u0303one family =\n\n\u03b1\u0303\n.\nNfam\n\nFor Nfam = 3, for [SU (2)]3 and [SU (3)]3 , we have:\n(2,3)\n\n\u03b1\u0303one family =\n\n\u03b1\u0303(2,3)\n.\n3\n\n\fPreon Model and Family Replicated E6 Unification\n\n13\n\nFor the family replicated group [U (1)]Nfam we obtain:\n\u03b1\u0303one family =\n\n\u03b1\u0303\nN\u2217\n(1)\n\nwhere N \u2217 = 21 Nfam (Nfam + 1). For Nfam = 3 and [U (1)]3 , we have: \u03b1\u0303one family = \u03b1\u0303(1) /6 (six\ntimes smaller!). This result was obtained previously in [9, 46, 47]. We conclude: FRGG models\nhelp to observe monopoles in Nature.\nRecent investigations [43, 44] are devoted to the Planck scale values of monopole coupling\nconstants. With help of MPP and FRGG-models we discover new possibilities for monopoles,\nfor dual charges in general.\n\n8\n\nConclusions and discussions\n\nIn the present paper we have developed a new model of preons suggested in [14, 15, 16]. According to this model, preons construct composite quark-leptons and (gauge and Higgs) bosons which\nare described by the three types of supersymmetric 'flipped' E6 gauge groups of unification. Crucial points of this model are: 1) the E6 -unification for preons inspired by Superstring theory\n[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], and 2) the dynamical assumption that preons are dyons confined by\nsupersymmetric non-Abelian hyper-magnetic flux tubes of type suggested in [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].\nThe E6 gauge group of symmetry can be broken into SU (6) \u00d7 U (2) \u2013 from one side, and\ninto SO(10) \u00d7 U (1) \u2013 from the second side. We have assumed that near the Planck scale\nHiggses belonging to the 78-dimensional representation of E6 gave the breakdown E6 \u2192 SU (6)\u00d7\nSU (2) \u2192 SU (6)\u00d7U (1), where SU (6)\u00d7U (1) is the largest relevant invariance group of the 78 [33].\nAssuming the condensation of spreons near the Planck scale, we have combined the Z6 center\nof SU (6) with the elements exp(i\u03c0) \u2208 U (1) to get topologically stable string solutions possessing\nboth windings, in SU (6) and U (1). Just this Z6 center of SU (6) explains the existence of the\nthree types of preonic k-strings associated with the three generations of quarks-leptons and\nbosons. Thus, in our preon model the dynamical properties of preons-dyons predict the three\n(and only three) generations (families) of composite quarks-leptons and bosons. In particular,\nsuch a dynamical picture leads to the existence of the three types of gauge bosons Ai\u03bc (where\ni = 1, 2, 3 is the generation index) belonging to the 27 \u00d7 27 = 1 + 78 + 650 representations\nof E6 . These three generations of hyper-gluons predict the family replicated unification [E6 ]3 =\nE6 \u00d7 E6 \u00d7 E6 near the scale \u223c 1017 GeV.\nIn the present paper we have considered the possibility of the further breakdown of the\nSUSY GUT [E6 ]3 into the Froggatt\u2013Nielsen\u2013Takanishi (FNT) model [SU (3)C ]3 \u00d7 [SU (2)L ]3 \u00d7\n[U (1)Y ]3 \u00d7 [U (1)(B\u2212L) ]3 [5, 6, 7, 13], existing at lower energies. We have discussed in Section 7\nall shortcomings and advantages of this model. Among its shortcomings we have no possibility\nto predict U (1)B\u2212L gauge group of symmetry and seesaw scale.\nWe have presented the following advantages of the FNT-model: the possibility to fit the SM\nparameters (masses and mixing angles), the description of the Planck scale values of the three\nSM gauge couplings, the prediction of the Planck scale values of monopole couplings etc.\nIn Section 6 we have presented investigation of the existence of the second minimum of the\neffective potential in our preon model, in accordance with the Multiple Point Principle suggested\nin [9, 10, 11, 12].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors deeply thank Professor H.B.
