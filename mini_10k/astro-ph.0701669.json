Introduction\nSupernovae explosion rates provide important information on the evolutionary scenario of SN progenitors, the star formation history of the Universe and ISM physic\n(See Refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). In recent years many SN surveys have been conducted\naimed to the detection of SN candidates to measure the SN rates as function of\nredshift. Most of them are designed to search SNe for their use as cosmological\nprobes (Refs 7, 8, 9) and, as a consequence, they are strongly biased towards type\nIa and they provide no information on the evolution of core-collapse SN rates. Recently we completed the first phase of a long term project aimed to measure the\nrate at intermediate redshift for all SN types (Ref 10) which allow to derive the first\nestimate of the core-collapse SNe rate at redshift z \u223c 0.3. The next step we have\nproposed is to perform a more efficient search at VST and to optimize the search\nstrategy we have written a simulation tool able to predict the numbers of SNe of\ndifferent types which are aspected to be discover in a magnitude-limited survey.\n1\n\n\f1st Workshop of Astronomy and Astrophysics for Students- Naples, 19-20 April 2006\n\n2\n\nTrim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\n1st Workshop of Astronomy and Astrophysics for Students\n\n2. Simulation Tool\nOur simulation is based on several assumptions: 1) galaxy luminosity density and\nrate evolution with redshift are described by a power law (see Ref 10); 2) the\ngeometry of Universe is flat with H0 = 75kms\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3 (see Ref 11); 3) the light\ncurves for different SNe types in the SN rest frame do not change with redshift. We\nhave created a catalogue of SN spectra extended from the UV to the infrared using\nspectra taken from IUE, HST and Asiago archives. The first step has been to join\nthe different spectral ranges obtaining homogeneus, extended spectra. With redshift\nthe observed SNe spectrum is stretched and shifted toward longer wavelengths and\nthe SN apparent magnitude is different from that measured in the SN rest frame.\nUsing our spectral library we estimated the K-correction as a function of redshift\nfor different SN types and filters combination. In particular we have estimated Kcorrection for the Sloan filter set. Besides we have determined the optimal filter band\nto maximize the number of detectable SNe. Finally, using the control time method,\nwe have determined the temporal interval between observations which optimize the\nsearch efficiency.\n3. Conclusions\nWe have computed the expected SN counts as a function of redshift by summing\nthe contribution of individual SN types. The number of SNe expected during the\nthree years of our VST SN search is \u223c300, a good statistics to improve the SN\nrate. Because of the lack of UV SN observations at high redshift our K-correction\nestimates are uncertain. On the other hand at this distance optical search should\nbe replaced by infrared ones because the optical emission of high redshift SNe is\nvery low. Another useful result is, at different redshift, the limit on the frequency\nof observations over which there is no gain as far as concern the number of SN\ndetection. We aim to extend the scope of our simulation tool to the planning of\nSN search with a generic observing facilities. In particular we are interested to the\nsimulation of a SN search with the new wide field infrared facility VISTA.\nReferences\n1. P. Madau, M. Della Valle & N. Panagia, MNRAS 297, L17 (1998).\n2. R.
