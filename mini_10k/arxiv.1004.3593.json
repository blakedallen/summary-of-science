A pair of points (x, y) in a Riemannian manifold (M, g) is said to\nhave the finite blocking property if there is a finite set P \u2282 M \\ {x, y} such\nthat every geodesic segment from x to y passes through a point of P .

Introduction\nLet M be a closed C \u221e manifold, and let g be a C \u221e Riemannian metric on M.\nWe consider a geodesic as a mapping \u03b3 : I \u2192 M , where I is an interval of positive\nlength, and \u03b3 is parametrized by arc length. Two geodesics \u03b3i : Ii \u2192 M , i = 1, 2\nwill be considered to be the same if and only if \u03b31 = \u03b32 \u25e6 \u03c6, where \u03c6 is a translation\nthat maps I1 onto I2 . Let x and y be points in M , possibly with x = y. When we\nsay that a geodesic \u03b3 : [c, d] \u2192 M is from x to y, we mean \u03b3(c) = x and \u03b3(d) = y.\nGiven a Riemannian metric g on M , a blocking set for (x, y) is defined to be a\nsubset P of M \\{x, y} such that every geodesic from x to y passes through a point in\nP . The pair (x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 M is said to have the finite blocking property for g if there\nexists a finite blocking set for (x, y). If every (x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 M has the finite blocking\nproperty, then (M, g) is called secure. (See [7] and [4] for an explanation of this\nterminology.) A Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called insecure if it is not secure,\nand it is called totally insecure if no pair (x, y) has the finite blocking property.\nFurthermore, it is called uniformly secure if there exists a positive integer n such\nthat any pair of points (x, y) has a blocking set with at most n elements.\nGiven a manifold M, it is natural to ask the following:\nQuestion. Which pairs of points (x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 M and which Riemannian metrics\ng on M are such that (x, y) has the finite blocking property for g?\nOur contribution in this direction is Theorem 1.1 below, which says that any\ngiven pair of points (x, y) fails to have the finite blocking property for a dense G\u03b4\nset of metrics. We will give the proof in Section 3.\nWe let G denote the set of C \u221e Riemannian metrics on M . For k = 1, 2, . . . , \u221e,\nthere exists a complete metric on G whose topology coincides with the C k topology\non G. In particular, the Baire category theorem applies to G with the C k topology.\nWhen we refer to the C k topology on M \u00d7 G or M \u00d7 M \u00d7 G, we mean the product\ntopology, where we take the manifold topology on M and the C k topology on G.\nTheorem 1.1. Let M be a closed C \u221e manifold of dimension at least two, and let\nG be the space of C \u221e Riemannian metrics on M . The following three statements\nhold.\n1\n\n\f2\n\n(1) Let x and y be two points in M , possibly with x = y. Let G = {g \u2208\nG : (x, y) fails to have the finite blocking property for g}. Then G contains the intersection of a countable collection of sets that are C 1 -open and\nC \u221e -dense in G. Thus, G contains a dense G\u03b4 set in the C k topology for\nk = 1, 2, . . . , \u221e.\n(2) Let G\u0303 = {(x, y, g) \u2208 M \u00d7 M \u00d7 G : (x, y) fails to have the finite blocking\nproperty for g}. Then G\u0303 contains the intersection of a countable collection\nof sets that are C 1 -open and C \u221e -dense in M \u00d7 M \u00d7 G. Thus, G\u0303 contains\na dense G\u03b4 set in the C k topology for k = 1, 2, . . . , \u221e.\n(3) Let \u011c = {(x, g) \u2208 M \u00d7 G : (x, x) fails to have the finite blocking property\nfor g}. Then \u011c contains the intersection of a countable collection of sets\nthat are C 1 -open and C \u221e -dense in M \u00d7 G. Thus, \u011c contains a dense G\u03b4\nset in the C k topology for k = 1, 2, . . . , \u221e.\nFrom (2) and (3), we can deduce the following corollary.\nCorollary 1.2. Let M be a closed C \u221e manifold of dimension at least two and\nsuppose k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , \u221e}.\n(1) There exists a dense G\u03b4 set G1 in G with the C k topology, so that for each\ng \u2208 G1 , there is a dense G\u03b4 subset R1 := R1 (g) of M \u00d7 M such that each\n(x, y) \u2208 R1 fails to have the finite blocking property for g.\n(2) There exists a dense G\u03b4 set G2 in G with the C k topology, so that for each\ng \u2208 G2 , there is a dense G\u03b4 subset R2 := R2 (g) \u2286 M such that for each\nx \u2208 R2 , (x, x) fails to have the finite blocking property for g.\nV. Bangert and E. Gutkin obtained stronger results for the case when the dimension of M is two and the genus is positive [1]. They proved that if M has genus\ngreater than one, then every Riemannian metric is totally insecure. Moreover, if\nM has genus one, they showed that non-flat metrics are insecure and a C 2 -open,\nC \u221e -dense set of metrics are totally insecure. These results provide evidence that\n(c) follows from (a) in the following conjecture, which originally appeared in [4] and\n[9]. A proof that (c) implies (b) is given in [8].\nConjecture 1.3. Let (M, g) be a closed C \u221e Riemannian manifold. The following\nstatements are equivalent.\n(a) (M, g) is secure.\n(b) (M, g) is uniformly secure.\n(c) g is a flat metric.\nWhile Conjecture 1.3 concerns the finite blocking property for all pairs of points,\nTheorem 1.1 shows that the finite blocking property can be destroyed for any given\npair of points, under some small perturbation of metric.\nIn the next section, we will present some results which will be used to prove\nTheorem 1.1. We refer the reader to [6] for background information about geodesics\nand conjugate points.\nWe thank Chris Connell for a helpful conversation that led to an improvement\nto our original version of Theorem 1.1.\n2. Some preliminary results\nWe begin with the following classical result by J. P. Serre [12], [10], [2], [11].\n\n\f3\n\nTheorem 2.1. Let (M, g) be a closed C \u221e -Riemannian manifold, and let x, y \u2208 M .\nThen there exist infinitely many geodesics from x to y.\nThe following lemma allows us to \"merge\" two foliations by geodesics for a\nRiemannian metric g into a new foliation by geodesics for a small perturbation of\ng, provided the two original foliations are C \u221e -close.\nFor a, b > 0, we let Ia denote the open interval (\u2212a, a) \u2282 R, and we let Bb denote\nthe open ball {w \u2208 Rn\u22121 : |w| < b}, where n is the dimension of the manifold M\nunder consideration.\nLemma 2.2. Let (M, g) be a closed C \u221e Riemannian manifold of dimension n \u2265 2,\nand let G be the set of C \u221e Riemannian metrics on M . Suppose N is an open\nneighborhood of g in G with the C \u221e topology. Choose a, b > 0, and let F = {f \u2208\nC \u221e (Ia \u00d7 Bb , M ) | f satisfies (i), (ii), (iii) below }.\n(i) The map f is a C \u221e -diffeomorphism onto its image.\n(ii) For all p \u2208 Bb , the map t 7\u2192 f (t, p) , for t \u2208 Ia , is a geodesic (for the\nmetric g).\n(iii) For all t \u2208 Ia , the (n \u2212 1)-dimensional submanifold {f (t, p) : p \u2208 Bb } is\nperpendicular (in the metric g) to all the geodesics in (ii).\nWe consider F with the relative topology induced from the C \u221e compact-open topology\non C \u221e (Ia \u00d7 Bb , M ). Suppose f0 \u2208 F . Then there exists an open neighborhood\nF0 \u2286 F of f such that for all f1 , f2 \u2208 F0 , there exists g\u0303 \u2208 N such that the following\nconditions are satisfied.\n(1) g\u0303 agrees with g on the complement of f1 (Ia/2 \u00d7 Bb/2 ) \u2229 f2 (Ia/2 \u00d7 Bb/2 ).\n(2) There is a family of g\u0303-geodesics \u03b3p : Ia \u2192 f1 (Ia \u00d7 Bb ) \u222a f2 (Ia \u00d7 Bb ), for\np \u2208 Bb/4 , such that\n(\nf1 (t, p), if t \u2208 (\u2212a, \u2212a/4);\n\u03b3p (t) =\nf2 (t, p), if t \u2208 (a/4, a).\n(3) If f1 (t, 0) = f2 (t, 0) for all t \u2208 Ia , then \u03b30 (t) = f1 (t, 0). This implies that\nthe map t 7\u2192 f1 (t, 0) for t \u2208 Ia , is a geodesic for g\u0303 as well.\nProof. Let (ai )0\u2264i\u22645 and (bj )0\u2264j\u22645 be strictly decreasing sequences of positive numbers, where a0 = a, a3 = a/2, a5 = a/4, b0 = b, b1 = b/2, and b5 = b/4. Let\nRi,j = Iai \u00d7 Bbj , for 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 5.\nLet h : R \u2192 [0, 1] be a C \u221e function such that\n(\n0, if t \u2264 \u2212a5 ;\nh(t) =\n1, if t \u2265 a5 ,\nand let H : M \u2192 [0, 1] be a C \u221e function such that\n(\n0, if x \u2208 M \\ f0 (R3,3 );\nH(x) =\n1, if x \u2208 f0 (R4,4 ).\nGiven f0 \u2208 F , the required open neighborhood F0 will be chosen so that functions\nf1, f2 \u2208 F0 satisfy the properties given below. We begin by requiring f1 , f2 to be\nsufficiently close to f0 in the C 0 topology so that\n(2.1)\n\nf2 (Ri+1,j+1 ) \u2286 f1 (Ri,j ) and f1 (Ri+1,j+1 ) \u2286 f2 (Ri,j ), for 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 4.\n\n\f4\n\nWe define \u03c6 : R1,1 \u2192 R0,0 by\n\u03c6(t, p) = (1 \u2212 h(t))(t, p) + h(t)(f1\u22121 \u25e6 f2 (t, p))\nfor (t, p) \u2208 R1,1 , where '+' denotes the usual vector addition in Rn . We have\n\u03c6(t, p) \u2208 R0,0 , because f1\u22121 \u25e6 f2 (R1,1 ) \u2286 R0,0 (by (2.1)), and \u03c6(t, p) is a convex\ncombination of f1\u22121 \u25e6 f2 (t, p) and (t, p).\nNext we consider f\u02c6 := f1 \u25e6 \u03c6 : R1,1 \u2192 f1 (R0,0 ). If f1 and f2 are close to f0 in\n\u221e\nC (R0,0 , M ), then \u03c6 is close to the inclusion map R1,1 \u0592\u2192 R0,0 in C \u221e (R1,1 , R0,0 ),\nand f\u02c6 is close to f0 in C \u221e (R1,1 , M ). We require f1 and f2 to be sufficiently close\nto f0 in C \u221e (R0,0 , M ) so that the following four conditions are satisfied:\n(2.2)\n\nf\u02c6 : R1,1 \u2192 M is a diffeomorphism onto its image,\n\n(2.3)\n\nf\u02c6(Ri+1,j+1 ) \u2286 f0 (Ri,j ) \u2229 f1 (Ri,j ) \u2229 f2 (Ri,j ), for 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 4,\n\n(2.4)\n\nf0 (R3,3 ) \u2286 f\u02c6(R2,2 ), and\n\n(2.5)\n\n(f1 ((\u2212a1 , \u2212a2 ] \u00d7 Bb2 ) \u222a f2 ([a2 , a1 ) \u00d7 Bb2 )) \u2229 f\u02c6(R5,2 ) = \u2205.\n\nFor (t, p) = (t, p1 , . . . , pn\u22121 ) \u2208 R2,2 , we define a Riemannian metric \u011d at f\u02c6(t, p) \u2208\nf\u02c6(R2,2 ) by\n!\n\u2202 f\u02c6 \u2202 f\u02c6\n(2.6)\n= 1,\n,\n\u011d\n\u2202t \u2202t\n!\n\u2202 f\u02c6 \u2202 f\u02c6\n\u011d\n(2.7)\n= 0, and\n,\n\u2202t \u2202yk\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202f1 \u2202f1\n\u2202f2 \u2202f2\n\u2202 f\u02c6 \u2202 f\u02c6\n= [1 \u2212 h(t)]g\n,\n,\n,\n+ h(t)g\n,\n\u011d\n\u2202pk \u2202pl\n\u2202pk \u2202pl\n\u2202pk \u2202pl\nfor 1 \u2264 k, l \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nWe know that, for i = 0, 1, 2, the original metric g satisfies\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u2202fi \u2202fi\n= 1, and\n,\n\u2202t \u2202t\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202fi \u2202fi\n,\n= 0, for k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\ng\n\u2202t \u2202pk\ng\n\nin the region fi (R0,0 ).\nWe define the required Riemannian metric as\ng\u0303 = H \u011d + (1 \u2212 H)g,\nwhere we interpret H \u011d to be 0 when H = 0.\nIf (t, p) \u2208 [\u2212a1 , \u2212a5 ] \u00d7 Bb1 , then h(t) = 0 and \u03c6(t, p) = (t, p); if (t, p) \u2208\n[a5 , a1 ] \u00d7 Bb1 , then h(t) = 1 and \u03c6(t, p) = f1\u22121 \u25e6 f2 (t, p). Thus\n\n(2.8)\n\nf\u02c6(t, p) =\n\n(\n\nf1 (t, p), if (t, p) \u2208 [\u2212a1 , \u2212a5 ] \u00d7 Bb1 ;\nf2 (t, p), if (t, p) \u2208 [a5 , a1 ] \u00d7 Bb1 .\n\n\f5\n\nTherefore \u011d agrees with g on f\u02c6(R2,2 \\ R5,2 ). If f1 and f2 are close to f0 in\nC \u221e (R0,0 , M ) , then \u011d is C \u221e -close to g on f\u02c6(R2,2 ) \u2287 f0 (R3,3 ). Since g\u0303 = g on\nM \\ f0 (R3,3 ), we may choose F0 sufficiently small so that g\u0303 \u2208 N for f1 , f2 \u2208 F0 .\nTo summarize, we have chosen F0 sufficiently small so that if f1 , f2 \u2208 F0 , then\n(2.1),(2.2),(2.3),(2.4), and (2.5) hold, and g\u0303 \u2208 N .\nNow we verify that (1), (2), and (3) hold.\nThe region where \u011d is defined and not equal to g is contained in f\u02c6(R5,2 ), which\nis a subset of f1 (R3,1 ) \u2229 f2 (R3,1 ), by (2.3). Therefore g\u0303 = g on the complement of\nf1 (R3,1 ) \u2229 f2 (R3,1 ), which is conclusion (1).\nSince H = 1 on f0 (R4,4 ) \u2287 f\u02c6(R5,5 ), we have g\u0303 = \u011d on f\u02c6(R5,5 ). For each p \u2208 Bb5 ,\nwe define a curve \u03b3p : Ia \u2192 M as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2f1 (t, p), if t \u2208 (\u2212a, \u2212a2 ];\n\u03b3p (t) = f\u02c6(t, p), if t \u2208 (\u2212a2 , a2 );\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nf2 (t, p), if t \u2208 [a2 , a).\nIt follows from (2.8) that these curves are smooth. Moreover, these curves are\ng\u0303-geodesics, because g\u0303 = g on f1 ((\u2212a, \u2212a2 ] \u00d7 Bb5 ) \u222a f2 ([a2 , a) \u00d7 Bb5 ) (by (2.5)),\n\u011d = g = g\u0303 on f\u02c6((Ia2 \\ Ia5 ) \u00d7 Bb5 ) = f1 ([\u2212a2 , \u2212a5 ] \u00d7 Bb5 ) \u222a f2 ([a5 , a2 ] \u00d7 Bb5 ),\ng\u0303 = \u011d on f\u02c6(R5,5 ), and the curves t 7\u2192 f\u02c6(t, p) are \u011d-geodesics for all p \u2208 Bb2 (by\n(2.6) and (2.7)). This proves conclusion (2). If f1 (t, 0) = f2 (t, 0) for t \u2208 Ia , then\n\u03c6(t, 0) = (t, 0) and f\u02c6(t, 0) = f1 (t, 0) for t \u2208 Ia1 . Therefore the g\u0303-geodesic \u03b30 is the\nsame as t 7\u2192 f1 (t, 0), which establishes (3).\n\u0003\nWe now define a notion of merging for two geodesics. This will be used in Lemma\n2.4 below.\nDefinition 2.3. Let M be a C \u221e -manifold, and let g, g\u0303 be Riemannian metrics on\nM . Suppose U is an open set in M , t0 \u2208 R, and \u03b3i : [r\u0302i , \u015di ] \u2192 M , i = 1, 2, are\ng-geodesics such that\n(2.9)\n\n{t \u2208 [r\u0302i , \u015di ] : \u03b3i (t) \u2208 U } = (ri , si ), where r\u0302i < ri < t0 < si < \u015di .\n\nWe say that a g\u0303-geodesic \u03b3 : [r\u03021 , \u015d2 ] \u2192 M , merges \u03b31 and \u03b32 within U if there exist\nr\u0303, s\u0303 such that r1 < r\u0303 < t0 < s\u0303 < s2 , \u03b3(r\u0303, s\u0303) \u2286 U , \u03b3(t) = \u03b31 (t) for r\u03021 \u2264 t \u2264 r\u0303, and\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b32 (t) for s\u0303 \u2264 t \u2264 \u015d2 .\nThe following lemma allows us to merge two geodesics according to Definition\n2.3. K. Burns and G. Paternain have a similar result in the 2-dimensional case [5].\nLemma 2.4. Let (M, g) be a closed C \u221e Riemannian manifold of dimension n \u2265 2,\nand let N be an open neighborhood of g in the C \u221e topology. Suppose U is a convex\n(with respect to g) open set in M and (x0 , v0 ) \u2208 T 1 U. Then there exists an open\nneighborhood V of (x0 , v0 ) in T 1 U such that for any (xi , vi ) \u2208 V, i = 1, 2, if\n\u03b3i : [r\u0302i , \u015di ] \u2192 M are g-geodesics that satisfy (2.9) and (\u03b3i (t0 ), \u03b3i\u2032 (t0 )) = (xi , vi ), for\ni = 1, 2, then there exists g\u0303 \u2208 N which agrees with g on M \\ U , and a g\u0303-geodesic \u03b3\nthat merges \u03b31 and \u03b32 within U .\nProof. Let \u03b30 : [r\u03020 , \u015d0 ] \u2192 M be a g-geodesic such that (\u03b30 (t0 ), \u03b30\u2032 (t0 )) = (x0 , v0 )\nand (2.9) is satisfied for i = 0 and some choice of r0 , s0 . By replacing U by a\nsmaller convex open neighborhood of x0 , if necessary, we may assume there exist\n\n\f6\n\nC \u221e orthonormal vector fields E1 , . . . , En on U such that En (\u03b30 (t)) = \u03b30\u2032 (t) for\nall t \u2208 (r0 , s0 ). We may assume that t0 = 0. Choose T such that 0 < T < |r0 |\nand x\u03030 := \u03b30 (\u2212T ) is not conjugate to x0 along \u03b30 |[\u2212T, 0]. For u \u2208 U and z =\n(z1 , . . . , zn ) \u2208 Rn , let\n(2.10)\n\n\u03a6(u, z) = z1 E1 (u) + * * * + zn En (u) \u2208 Tu U.\n\nDefine \u03c6 : {p = (p1 , . . . pn\u22121 ) \u2208 Rn\u22121 : |p| < 1} \u2192 {w \u2208 Rn : |w| = 1} by\n(2.11)\n\n\u03c6(p) = (p1 , . . . pn\u22121 , 1 \u2212 (p21 + * * * + p2n\u22121 )1/2 ).\n\nSince x\u03030 and x0 are not conjugate along \u03b30 |[\u2212T, 0] , there exist \u00e3, b\u0303 > 0 such that\nthe map\nf0 (t, p) := expx\u03030 (\u03a6(x\u03030 , (t + T )\u03c6(p))),\ndefined for (t, p) \u2208 I\u00e3 \u00d7 Bb\u0303 , is a C \u221e diffeomorphism onto its image, and its image is\ncontained in U. Note that f0 (0, 0) = x0 . Moreover, there exist a, b with 0 < a < \u00e3,\n0 < b < b\u0303, an open neighborhood A of Id in SO(n), and an open neighborhood \u0168\nof x\u03030 in U such that for x\u0303 \u2208 \u0168 and A \u2208 A, the map\nf (t, p) := expx\u0303 (\u03a6(x\u0303, (t + T )A(\u03c6(p)))),\ndefined for (t, p) \u2208 Ia \u00d7 Bb is a C \u221e diffeomorphism onto its image, and its image is\nin U . Now choose V to be an open neighborhood of (x0 , v0 ) in T 1 U such that for\neach (x, v) \u2208 V, the geodesic \u03b3\u0303 with (\u03b3\u0303(0), \u03b3\u0303 \u2032 (0)) = (x, v) satisfies x\u0303 := \u03b3\u0303(\u2212T ) \u2208 \u0168\nand there exists A \u2208 A with \u03a6(x\u0303, A(\u03c6(0))) = \u03b3\u0303 \u2032 (\u2212T ). We also require V to be small\nenough so that x\u0303 is sufficiently close to x\u03030 and A can be chosen sufficiently close to\nId, so that f is in the neighborhood F0 of f0 given in Lemma 2.2. (The hypothesis\n(iii) in Lemma 2.2 for f0 , as well as f1 , f2 defined below, follows from the Gauss\nLemma.)\nLet (xi , vi ) \u2208 V, i = 1, 2, and suppose \u03b3i : [r\u0302i , \u015di ] \u2192 M , i = 1, 2, are g-geodesics\nsuch that (2.9) is satisfied and (\u03b3i (0), \u03b3i\u2032 (0)) = (xi , vi ). Let ri , si , i = 1, 2, be as in\n(2.9). For i = 1, 2, define\nfi (t, p) := expx\u0303i (\u03a6(x\u0303i , (t + T )Ai (\u03c6(p)))),\nfor (t, p) \u2208 Ia \u00d7 Bb , where x\u0303i := \u03b3i (\u2212T ), and Ai \u2208 A is such that \u03a6(x\u0303i , Ai (\u03c6(0))) =\n\u03b3i\u2032 (\u2212T ). Then fi (t, 0) = \u03b3i (t) for t \u2208 Ia . From Lemma 2.2, we obtain g\u0303 \u2208 N which\nagrees with g on M \\ U so that conclusion (2) of Lemma 2.2 holds. Finally, we\ndefine the required g\u0303-geodesic \u03b3 : [r\u03021 , \u015d2 ] \u2192 M as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03b31 (t), if t \u2208 [r\u03021 , \u2212a];\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b30 (t), if t \u2208 (\u2212a, a);\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b32 (t), if t \u2208 [a, \u015d2 ],\nwhere \u03b30 is as in Lemma 2.2(2).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.5 below allows us to destroy conjugate points along a geodesic by\nmaking a small perturbation of the metric. A two-dimensional version of this\nlemma is contained in [5].\nLemma 2.5. Let (M, g) be a closed C \u221e Riemannian manifold of dimension n \u2265 2,\nand let N be an open neighborhood of g in the C \u221e topology. Let x, y \u2208 M and\nsuppose \u03b3 : [0, L] \u2192 M is a g-geodesic from x to y. Let 0 = t0 < t1 < * * * < tl = L,\nwhere l \u2265 1, and define zk := \u03b3(tk ) for k = 0, . . . , l. Suppose s0 \u2208 (tj , tj+1 ) for\n\n\f7\n\nsome j \u2208 {0, . . . , l \u2212 1} and u0 := \u03b3(s0 ) is not a self-intersection point of \u03b3 (i.e.,\nu0 \u2208\n/ \u03b3([0, T ] \\ {s0 })). Let U0 be an open neighborhood of u0 . Then there exists\n\u011d \u2208 N that agrees with g on M \\ U0 such that the following conditions hold:\n(1) \u03b3 is also a unit speed geodesic for \u011d.\n(2) If k1 and k2 are integers such that 0 \u2264 k1 \u2264 j and j + 1 \u2264 k2 \u2264 l, then zk1\nis not conjugate to zk2 along \u03b3|[tk1 , tk2 ] in the \u011d metric.\nProof. It suffices to prove the lemma for the case l = 1 and 0 = t0 < s0 < t1 = L,\nbecause we can then obtain (2) in the general case through a finite sequence of\nperturbations of the metric (within N ) corresponding to each possible pair (k1 , k2 )\nwith 0 \u2264 k1 \u2264 j and j + 1 \u2264 k2 \u2264 l. Each successive perturbation adds one\nmore pair (k1 , k2 ) such that zk1 is not conjugate to zk2 along \u03b3|[tk1 , tk2 ], and the\nperturbations can be taken small so that no new conjugacies are introduced between\nsuch pairs of points.\nWe now assume l = 1 and 0 = t0 < s0 < t1 = L . By perturbing s0 slightly, if\nnecessary, we may assume that x is not conjugate to u0 along \u03b3|[0, s0 ]. We may also\nassume that the open neighborhood U0 of u0 is chosen so that {t \u2208 [0, L] : \u03b3(t) \u2208\nU0 } = (s0 \u2212 \u03b7, s0 + \u03b7) for some \u03b7 with 0 < \u03b7 < min(s0 , t1 \u2212 s0 ). Let U be an open\nneighborhood of x disjoint from U0 . Suppose \u03c4 \u2208 (0, s0 \u2212 \u03b7) is such that \u03b3|[0, \u03c4 ] is\none-to-one, and whenever 0 < t \u2264 \u03c4, x is not conjugate to \u03b3(t) along \u03b3|[0, t], and\n\u03b3(t) is not conjugate to y along \u03b3|[t, L]. Let E1 , . . . , En be C \u221e vector fields along\n\u03b3|[0, \u03c4 ] with \u03b3 \u2032 (t) = En (\u03b3(t)) for t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ]. Let \u03a6 and \u03c6 be as in (2.10) and (2.11)\nfor u \u2208 \u03b3([0, \u03c4 ]). Since x is not conjugate to u0 along \u03b3|[0, s0 ], there exist \u00e3, b\u0303 > 0\nsuch that the map\nf1 (t, p) := expx,g (\u03a6(x, (t + s0 )\u03c6(p)),\ndefined for (t, p) \u2208 I\u00e3 \u00d7 Bb\u0303 , is a C \u221e diffeomorphism onto its image, and its image\nis in U0 . (The 'g' in the subscript indicates we are referring to the exponential map\n \u0303 0 < \u03b4\u0303 < \u03c4 , such\nfor the metric g. ) There exist a, b, \u03b4\u0303 with 0 < a < \u00e3, 0 < b < b,\nthat the map\nf2 (t, p) := expx\u0303,g (\u03a6(x\u0303, (t + s0 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c6(p)),\ndefined for (t, p) \u2208 Ia \u00d7 Bb is a C \u221e diffeomorphism onto its image, and its image is\n \u0303 Let f0 be the restriction of f1 to Ia \u00d7 Ib , and\nin U0 for any x\u0303 := \u03b3(\u03b4) with 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b4.\nlet F0 be as in Lemma 2.2. We choose \u03b4 sufficiently small so that f2 \u2208 F0 . Since\nf1 (Ia/2 \u00d7 Bb/2 ) \u2229 f2 (Ia/2 \u00d7 Bb/2 ) is a subset of U0 , Lemma 2.2 implies that there is\na \u011d \u2208 N which agrees with g on M \\ U0 and Lemma 2.2(2) holds with g\u0303 replaced\nby \u011d. We also obtain Lemma 2.2(3) with g\u0303 replaced by \u011d, because f1 (t, 0) = f2 (t, 0)\nfor t \u2208 Ia . Therefore \u03b3 is also a geodesic for \u011d. For p \u2208 Bb/4 , let \u03b3p be as in Lemma\n2.2(2) and define \u03c3p : [0, L] \u2192 M by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif t \u2208 [0, s0 \u2212 a];\n\uf8f2expx,g (\u03a6(x, t\u03c6(p)),\n(2.12)\n\u03c3p (t) = \u03b3p (t \u2212 s0 ),\nif t \u2208 (s0 \u2212 a, s0 + a);\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nexpx\u0303,g (\u03a6(x\u0303, (t \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c6(p)), if t \u2208 [s0 + a, L].\n\nThen \u03c3p is a \u011d-geodesic that merges, within U0 , a g-geodesic originating at x with\ninitial velocity \u03a6(x, \u03c6(p)) and a g-geodesic that is at x\u0303 with velocity \u03a6(x\u0303, \u03c6(p)) at\ntime \u03b4. Thus, for p \u2208 Bb/4 ,\n(2.13)\n\nexpx,\u011d (\u03a6(x, t\u03c6(p))) = expx\u0303,g (\u03a6(x, (t \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c6(p))\n\n\f8\n\nfor s0 + a \u2264 t \u2264 L. Since x\u0303 is not conjugate to y along \u03b3|[\u03b4, L] in the metric g,\nexpx\u0303,g is locally a diffeomorphism near (L \u2212 \u03b4)\u03b3 \u2032 (\u03b4). By (2.13), this implies that\nexpx,\u011d is locally a diffeomorphism near L\u03b3 \u2032 (0). Therefore x is not conjugate to y\nalong \u03b3 in the \u011d metric.\n\u0003\nA geodesic lasso is defined to be a closed curve which is a geodesic except at one\npoint, where it fails to be regular. The following Lemma 2.6 allows us to perturb a\ngeodesic so that it avoids a finite set of points on M , and it also allows us to change\na closed geodesic to a geodesic lasso.\nLemma 2.6.

Let {t \u2208 [0, L] : \u03b3(t) \u2208 Z} = {tk : k = 0, . . . , l}, where\n0 = t0 < * * * < tl = L, l \u2265 1, and define zk := \u03b3(tk ), for k = 0, . . . l. Assume that\n(i) x is not conjugate to zk along \u03b3|[0, tk ], for k = 1, . . . , l.\n(ii) zk is not conjugate to y along \u03b3|[tk , L], for k = 0, . . . , l \u2212 1.\nSuppose s0 \u2208 (0, L), u0 := \u03b3(s0 ) is not a self-intersection point of \u03b3, and u0 \u2208\n/ Z.\nLet U0 be an open neighborhood of u0 . Then there exist open neighborhoods W1\nand W2 of \u03b3 \u2032 (0) and \u03b3 \u2032 (L) in Tx1 M and Ty1 M , respectively, such that for any\nw1 \u2208 W1 \\ {\u03b3 \u2032 (0)} and any w2 \u2208 W2 \\ {\u03b3 \u2032 (L)}, there exists g\u0303 \u2208 N that agrees with\ng on M \\ U0 and a g\u0303-geodesic \u03b3\u0303 : [0, L] \u2192 M from x to y such that \u03b3\u0303 \u2032 (0) = w1 ,\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2032 (L) = w2 , \u03b3\u0303((0, L)) \u2229 Z = \u2205, and x is not conjugate to y along \u03b3\u0303 for g\u0303.\nProof. We may assume that Z \u2282 \u03b3([0, L]). By replacing U0 by a smaller open\nneighborhood of u0 if necessary, we may assume that U0 is convex for g, U0 \u2229Z = \u2205,\nand {t \u2208 [0, L] : \u03b3(t) \u2208 U0 } = (s0 \u2212 \u03b7, s0 + \u03b7), for some \u03b7 > 0.\nSince x is not conjugate to zk along \u03b3|[0, tk ] for k = 1, . . . , l, and expx,g is locally\na diffeomorphism near 0 \u2208 Tx M , there exist neighborhoods Vk of tk \u03b3 \u2032 (0) in Tx M ,\nfor k = 0, . . . , l, such that the maps expx,g : Vk \u2192 M are diffeomorphisms onto\ntheir images. Also,\n(2.14)\n\nZ \u2229 expx,g ({t\u03b3 \u2032 (0) : t \u2208 [0, L]} \\ (V0 \u222a * * * Vl )) = \u2205,\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nbecause (exp\u22121\nx,g Z) \u2229 {t\u03b3 (0) : t \u2208 [0, L]} = {t0 \u03b3 (0), . . . , tl \u03b3 (0)}. By the continuity\nof expx,g , we can choose W1 sufficiently small so that (2.14) still holds for \u03b3 replaced\nby any g-geodesic \u03b31 : [0, L] \u2192 M with \u03b31 (0) = x and \u03b31\u2032 (0) \u2208 W1 . If \u03b31\u2032 (0) \u2208\nW1 \\ {\u03b3 \u2032 (0)}, then {t\u03b31\u2032 (0) : t \u2208 (0, L]} \u2229 (V0 \u222a * * * \u222a Vl ) does not contain any of\ntk \u03b3 \u2032 (0), k = 0, . . . , l. Thus, (2.14) for \u03b31 implies that \u03b31 ((0, L]) \u2229 Z = \u2205. Similarly,\nif W2 is sufficiently small, then for any g-geodesic \u03b32 : [0, L] \u2192 M with \u03b32 (L) = y\nand \u03b32\u2032 (L) \u2208 W2 \\ \u03b3 \u2032 (L) , we have \u03b32 ([0, L)) \u2229 Z = \u2205.\nLet v0 = \u03b3 \u2032 (s0 ) and let V be an open neighborhood of (u0 , v0 ) in T 1 U0 satisfying\nthe conclusion of Lemma 2.4 (with U replaced by U0 and x0 replaced by u0 ). In\naddition to the requirements of the preceding paragraph, we require W1 and W2 to\nbe sufficiently small so that if \u03b3i : [0, L] \u2192 M , i = 1, 2, are such that \u03b31 (0) = x,\n\u03b31\u2032 (0) \u2208 W1 , \u03b32 (L) = y, and \u03b32\u2032 (L) \u2208 W2 , then there exist ri , si with 0 < ri < s0 <\nsi < L, such that {t \u2208 [0, L] : \u03b3i (t) \u2208 U0 } = (ri , si ) and (\u03b3i (s0 ), \u03b3i\u2032 (s0 )) \u2208 V.\nSuppose w1 \u2208 W1 \\ {\u03b3 \u2032 (0)} and w2 \u2208 W2 \\ {\u03b3 \u2032 (L)}, and let \u03b3i : [0, L] \u2192 M ,\ni = 1, 2, be g-geodesics such that \u03b31 (0) = x, \u03b31\u2032 (0) = w1 , \u03b32 (L) = y, and \u03b32\u2032 (L) = w2 .\nBy Lemma 2.4, there exists a metric g\u0303 \u2208 N that agrees with g on M \\ U0 and a\ng\u0303-geodesic \u03b3\u0303 : [0, L] \u2192 M that merges \u03b31 and \u03b32 within U0 . Since U0 \u2229 Z = \u2205 and\n\n\f9\n\n\u03b31 ((0, L)) \u2229 Z = \u2205 = \u03b32 ((0, L)) \u2229 Z, we have \u03b3\u0303((0, L)) \u2229 Z = \u2205. By Lemma 2.5 we\ncan make a small additional perturbation of the metric g\u0303 within U0 , if necessary,\nto arrange for x and y to not be conjugate along \u03b3\u0303.\n\u0003\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nWe now use the results of Section 2 to prove Theorem 1.1. The notation tr(\u03b3)\nwill mean the trace of a curve \u03b3 : I \u2192 M , i.e., tr(\u03b3) = {\u03b3(t) : t \u2208 I}.\nProof. Let (x, y, g) \u2208 M \u00d7 M \u00d7 G, and let n \u2208 N. We consider the statement\nS(x, y, n, g) : there exist g-geodesics \u03b3i : [0, Li ] \u2192 M from x to y, i = 1, . . . , n,\nwhich satisfy the following four properties:\n(i) If x 6= y, then the set of tangent vectors\n{\u03b31\u2032 (0), \u03b32\u2032 (0), . . . , \u03b3n\u2032 (0)}\nat x are pairwise linearly independent, and the set of tangent vectors\n{\u03b31\u2032 (L1 ), \u03b32\u2032 (L2 ), . . . , \u03b3n\u2032 (Ln )}\nat y are pairwise linearly independent. If x = y, then the set of tangent\nvectors\n{\u03b31\u2032 (0), \u03b31\u2032 (L1 ), \u03b32\u2032 (0), \u03b32\u2032 (L2 ), . . . , \u03b3n\u2032 (0), \u03b3n\u2032 (Ln )}\nare pairwise linearly independent. Thus we cannot join \u03b3i to \u03b3j smoothly\nat x or at y, for any i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\n(ii) For each i = 1, . . . , n, we have \u03b3i ((0, Li )) \u2229 {x, y} = \u2205. That is, \u03b3i meets x\nand y only at its endpoints.\n(iii) Any three of \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n are concurrent only at x and at y.\n(iv) The point x is not conjugate to y in the metric g along \u03b3i |[0, Li ], for i =\n1, . . . , n.\nWe define Hn (x, y) := {g \u2208 G : S(x, y, n, g) is satisfied}. We make the following\nclaim:\nClaim 3.1. (a) Hn (x, y) is C \u221e -dense in G and (b) there is a C 1 -open neighborhood\nGn (x, y) of Hn (x, y) in G such that parts (i), (ii), and (iii) of S(x, y, n, g) are satisfied\nfor all g \u2208 Gn (x, y).\nT\nClaim 3.1 implies that the set Gn (x, y) is a dense G\u03b4 set for G with the C k\ntopology,Tfor k = 1, 2, . . . , \u221e. Suppose P \u2286 M \\ {x, y} is a set with m points,\nand g \u2208 Gn (x, y). Since g \u2208 G2m+1 , we can find 2m + 1 g-geodesics that satisfy\n(iii). If P were a blocking set for (x, y), then by the pigeonhole principle, at least\nthree of these geodesics would pass through the same point in P , which leads to\ncontradiction. Hence there is no finite blocking set for (x, y), and Theorem 1.1(1)\nfollows from Claim 3.1.\nen := {(x, y, g) \u2208 M \u00d7 M \u00d7 G : S(x, y, n, g) is satisfied}\nSimilarly, if we define H\nbn := {(x, g) \u2208 M \u00d7 G : S(x, x, n, g)} is satisfied}, and we prove the foland H\nT\nT\nlowing claims, then Theorem 1.1(2),(3) will follow by considering Gen and Gbn ,\nrespectively.\nen is C \u221e -dense in M \u00d7 M \u00d7 G and (b) there is a C 1 -open neighClaim 3.2.

For n = 1, let N be\nany non-empty C \u221e -open set in G, and let g \u2208 N . Let \u03b3 : [0, L] \u2192 M be a ggeodesic from x to y. By restricting the domain of \u03b3, if necessary, we may assume\nthat \u03b3((0, L)) \u2229 {x, y} = \u2205. Then we let l = 1 and 0 = t0 < t1 = L in Lemma\n2.5. By Lemma 2.5, there exists \u011d \u2208 N such that \u03b3 is also a unit speed geodesic\nfor \u011d and x is not conjugate to y along \u03b3. If (x, \u03b3 \u2032 (0)) 6= (y, \u03b3 \u2032 (L)), then we let\ng1 = \u011d, and \u03b31 = \u03b3. If (x, \u03b3 \u2032 (0)) = (y, \u03b3 \u2032 (L)), that is, \u03b3 is a closed geodesic, then\nwe apply Lemma 2.6 to obtain g1 \u2208 N and a g1 -geodesic lasso \u03b31 : [0, L] \u2192 M with\n\u03b31 (0) = \u03b31 (L) = x but \u03b31\u2032 (0) 6= \u03b31\u2032 (L), and x \u2208\n/ \u03b31 ((0, L)). Then (i) , (ii), and (iv)\nare satisfied, and (iii) is vacuous. Since N is arbitrary, H1 (x, y) is C \u221e -dense.\nNext we suppose Hn\u22121 (x, y) is C \u221e -dense for some n \u2265 2, and we will prove\nthat Hn (x, y) is C \u221e -dense. Let N be any non-empty C \u221e -open set in G. There\nexist gn\u22121 \u2208 Hn\u22121 (x, y) \u2229 N and gn\u22121 -geodesics \u03b3i : [0, Li ] \u2192 M from x to y,\ni = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, so that properties (i) - (iv) are satisfied with n replaced by n \u2212 1.\nBy Theorem 2.1, there exists a gn\u22121 -geodesic \u03b3 : [0, L] \u2192 M from x to y, distinct\nfrom \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 . If x = y, we also require \u03b3 to be distinct from \u2212\u03b31 , . . . , \u2212\u03b3n\u22121 ,\nwhere \u2212\u03b3i is \u03b3i traversed in the opposite direction.\nBy (i) and (ii), we have tr(\u03b3) * tr(\u03b31 ) \u222a * * * \u222a tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ). However, it may happen\nthat tr(\u03b3) contains one (or more) of the sets tr(\u03b31 ), . . . , tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ). If x = y, then we\ncan restrict the domain of \u03b3, if necessary, so that tr(\u03b3) does not contain any of the\nsets tr(\u03b31 ), . . . , tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ). If x 6= y, then we can restrict the domain of \u03b3, if necessary,\nto obtain a gn\u22121 -geodesic from x to y such that one of the following happens: (a)\ntr(\u03b3) does not contain any of the sets tr(\u03b31 ), . . . , tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ); (b) \u03b3 consists of one\nof \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 preceded by a gn\u22121 -geodesic from x to x; (c) \u03b3 consists of one of\n\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 followed by a gn\u22121 -geodesic from y to y. If (a) holds, then we assume\nthat tr(\u03b3) does not contain any of the sets tr(\u03b31 ), . . . , tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ), and the rest of\nthis paragraph can be skipped. So assume that one of cases (b) or (c) hold, and\nassume that the domain of \u03b3 has been restricted so that cases (b) and (c) do not\nhold for any further restriction to a proper closed subinterval of the domain. Let\nu0 \u2208 tr(\u03b3)\\[tr(\u03b31 )\u222a* * *\u222atr(\u03b3n\u22121 )] be such that u0 is not a self-intersection point of \u03b3,\nand let U0 be an open neighborhood of u0 such that U0 \u2229[tr(\u03b31 )\u222a* * *\u222atr(\u03b3n\u22121 )] = \u2205.\nBy Lemma 2.5, we can make a perturbation of the gn\u22121 metric within U0 such that\n\u03b3 remains a geodesic, the new metric is in N , and neither of x or y is conjugate\nto either of x or y along an arc of \u03b3. Then Lemma 2.6 applies with Z = {x, y}.\nThus we may again perturb the metric within U0 to produce a new metric \u011d \u2208 N\nand a \u011d-geodesics \u03b3\u0302 close to \u03b3 and different from \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 , such that \u03b3\u0302 meets\nx and y only at its endpoints. In particular, tr(\u03b3) does not contain any of the sets\ntr(\u03b31 ), . . . , tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ). Since U0 \u2229 [tr(\u03b31 ) \u222a * * * \u222a tr(\u03b3n\u22121 )] = \u2205, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 remain\ngeodesics for \u011d.\nFrom the preceding paragraph, we have a metric \u011d \u2208 N and a \u011d-geodesic \u03b3\u0302 :\n[0, L] \u2192 M from x to y such that \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 are \u011d-geodesics and tr(\u03b3\u0302) does not\ncontain any of the sets tr(\u03b31 ), . . . , tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ). Then tr(\u03b3\u0302) \u2229 [tr(\u03b31 ) \u222a * * * \u222a tr(\u03b3n\u22121 )]\nis a finite set. If n = 2, let Z = {x, y}; if n > 2, let Z be the collection of all\nintersection points between the trace of any two of \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 . From (i) and (ii),\nwe know that Z is a finite set. We also have x, y \u2208 Z. We want to perturb \u03b3\u0302 so\n\n\f11\n\nthat it does not meet Z except at its endpoints. Let \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 (Z) \u2229 [0, L] = {t0 , . . . , tl },\nwhere 0 = t0 < * * * < tl = L, and denote zk := \u03b3\u0302(tk ), for k = 0, . . . , l. Let\ns1 \u2208 (t0 , t1 ) , s2 \u2208 (tl\u22121 , tl ), s1 < s2 , u1 := \u03b3\u0302(s1 ), u2 := \u03b3\u0302(s2 ) be such that\nu1 , u2 \u2208\n/ tr(\u03b31 ) \u222a * * * \u222a tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ) and u1 , u2 are not self-intersection points of \u03b3\u0302.\nWe can apply Lemma 2.5 twice with s0 = si and U0 = Ui for i = 1, 2, where\n(U1 \u222a U2 ) \u2229 [tr(\u03b31 ) \u222a * * * \u222a tr(\u03b3n\u22121 )] = \u2205. Thus we obtain a metric \u1e21 \u2208 N such\nthat \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 are \u1e21-geodesics, and conditions (i) and (ii) in Lemma 2.6 hold\nfor g replaced by \u1e21 and \u03b3 replaced by \u03b3\u0302. Hence, by Lemma 2.6, there is a metric\ng\u0303 \u2208 N such that \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 are g\u0303-geodesics, and there is a g\u0303-geodesic \u03b3\u0303 from x\nto y that is different from \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 , and does not meet any point of Z except\nat its endpoints. Moreover, by Lemma 2.6, we may choose g\u0303 and \u03b3\u0303 so that x and\ny are not conjugate along \u03b3\u0303 in the g\u0303-metric. All of the perturbations of the metric\ncan be done outside a neighborhood of tr(\u03b31 ) \u222a * * * \u222a tr(\u03b3n\u22121 ). We let gn = g\u0303. Then\n\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 are gn -geodesics, and (iv) remains true for \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\u22121 with the metric\ngn . Thus properties (i)-(iv) hold for \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n , where \u03b3n = \u03b3\u0303, and g is replaced by\ngn . Since N is arbitrary, we conclude that Hn (x, y) is C \u221e -dense. This completes\nthe proof of Claim 3.1(a).\nClaim 3.2(a) and Claim 3.3(a) follow from Claim 3.1(a), because H\u0303n is C \u221e dense in each fiber {(x, y)} \u00d7 G, and \u0124n is C \u221e -dense in each fiber {x} \u00d7 G.\nNext we want to prove Claim 3.1(b). Let g \u2208 Hn (x, y), and suppose \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n\nare g-geodesics that satisfy properties (i)-(iv).\nIf we consider geodesics as curves in T 1 M , then they are solutions to a system\nof first order ordinary differential equations whose coefficients depend only on the\nfirst derivatives of the metric. For the purpose of defining C 1 distances between the\ngiven geodesics \u03b3i and nearby curves \u03b3\u0303i , we extend the domain of \u03b3i to [0, Li + 1].\nThe C 1 distance will be measured with respect to the natural metric on T 1 M\ninduced by g. For any \u01eb > 0 there exists a C 1 neighborhood N1 of g in G and a\n\u03b4 = \u03b4(\u01eb) > 0 such that: if \u011d \u2208 N1 and \u03b3\u0303i is a \u011d-geodesic with \u03b3 \u0303i (0) = \u03b3i (0) and\n|\u03b3 \u0303i \u2032 (0) \u2212 \u03b3i\u2032 (0))| < \u03b4, then the C 1 distance between \u03b3\u0303i |[0, Li + 1] and \u03b3i |[0, Li + 1] is\nless than \u01eb. We choose \u01eb > 0 such that if the C 1 distance between \u03b3\u0303i |[0, Li + 1] and\n\u03b3i |[0, Li + 1] is less than \u01eb, |Li \u2212 L\u0303i | < \u01eb, and \u03b3\u0303i (L\u0303i ) = y, then conditions (i)-(iii)\nhold with \u03b3i replaced by \u03b3\u0303i , and Li replaced by L\u0303i .\nBy (iv), y is not g-conjugate to x along any of \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n . We choose open\nneighborhoods U1 , . . . , Un of L1 \u03b31\u2032 (0), . . . , Ln \u03b3n\u2032 (0) in Tx M , respectively, and an\nopen neighborhood U of y in M , so that\nexpx,g : Ui \u2192 U\nis a local diffeomorphism, for i = 1, . . . , n. By replacing U and Ui by smaller open\nneighhorhoods, if necessary, we may assume that if \u03b3\u0303i\u2032 (0)L\u0303i \u2208 Ui , then |Li \u2212 L\u0303i | < \u01eb\nand |\u03b3 \u0303i \u2032 (0) \u2212 \u03b3i\u2032 (0)| < \u03b4.\n/ expx,g (\u2202Bi )\nIf Bi \u2282 Ui is an open ball centered at Li \u03b3i\u2032 (0) with Bi \u2282 Ui , then y \u2208\nand the topological degree of expx,g |\u2202Bi is nonzero at y. Any continuous map\nfi : Bi \u2192 U that is sufficiently close to expx,g |Bi in the C 0 topology also satisfies\ny \u2208\n/ fi (\u2202Bi ) , and the topological degree of fi |\u2202Bi is nonzero at y. This implies\ny \u2208 fi (Bi ). (See, for instance, Theorem 1.1 of [3].) Now we choose a C 1 -open\nneighborhood N2 \u2282 N1 of g such that if g\u0303 \u2208 N2 , then expx,g\u0303 is sufficiently C 0 -close\nto expx,g on Bi , i = 1, . . . , n, so that there exist yi \u2208 Bi with expx,g\u0303 yi = y. For\ng\u0303 \u2208 N2 , let \u03b3 \u0303i , i = 1, . . . , n, be g\u0303-geodesics defined on [0, L\u0303i ] such that \u03b3\u0303i\u2032 (0)L\u0303i = yi .\n\n\f12\n\nThen conditions (i)-(iii) hold for \u03b3i , Li , g replaced by \u03b3\u0303i , L\u0303i , g\u0303 , respectively. Thus\nthere exists a C 1 -open neighborhood Gn of Hn such that conditions (i)-(iii) hold\nfor all g\u0303 \u2208 Gn .\nThis finishes the proof of Claim 3.1(b), and thus the proof of Theorem 1.1(1).\nThe proofs of Claims 3.2(b) and 3.3(b) are similar to the proof of Claim 3.1(b),\nexcept we do not assume that \u03b3 \u0303i (0) = \u03b3i (0). This completes the proof of Theorem\n1.1.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] V. Bangert and E. Gutkin, Insecurity for compact surfaces of positive genus, Preprint,\narXiv:0908.1138.\n[2] M.
