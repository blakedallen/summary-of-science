This can be described as a\nquantum correlation of the systems. We shall clarify the nature of this nonlocality by considering the EPR effect for spinning particles propagating in\nan external gravitational field. It is not evident that the correlation must\nexist in this case because there is no 'natural' correspondence between the\ndirections in the two spatially separated regions in a curved space-time. We\nshall however see that an approximate correlation may exist even in this\ncase and that the correlated directions are connected with each other by the\nparallel transport along the world lines of the particles.1 This proves that\nthe apparent non-locality is in fact of a local nature.\nIt is well known that the EPR effect may be realized with the help of\ntwo spin 1/2 particles forming in the decay of a scalar particle and therefore\nhaving correlated spin projections. In this case the measurement of the spin\nprojection of the first particle resulting say in m(1)\nz = 1/2 (spin up) makes\nthe spin projection of the other particle definite, m(2)\nz = \u22121/2 (spin down),\nwhich may be verified by its measurement.\nThis phenomenon is well understood and easily explained by the consideration of the state of both particles after the decay:\n1\n\u221a (| \u2191i1 | \u2193i2 \u2212 | \u2193i1 | \u2191i2 ) .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nThis so called entangled state means that the projections of the spins of both\nparticles on the same axis z are correlated: the measurement of them always\ngives opposite results. After some period of free evolution the particles may\nhave moved far away from each other, but the spin state of both particle and\ntherefore the correlation of the spin projections will be the same.\nThe localization of the particles in two spatially separated regions (the key\npoint for the EPR paradox) is no obstacle for a correct formulation of such\na correlation 'in ordinary conditions'. Indeed, the statement \"two particles\n1\n\nIn quantum mechanics the concept of a world line may be introduced in the framework\nof an approximation, see later.\n\n2\n\n\flocated in different space regions have opposite spin projections on axis z\"\nhas quite a definite meaning under the condition that the gravitational field\nacting on the particles is negligible.\nThe situation however radically changes if the particles move in a substantial gravitational field. In this case the statement \"If m(1)\nz = 1/2, then\nm(2)\n=\n\u22121/2\"\nhas\nno\nsense\nfor\nspatially\nseparated\nparticles,\nbecause, in the\nz\nabsence of teleparallelism, the axis z in the region where the second particle\nis located may be chosen independently of the z axis in the vicinity of the\nfirst particle.\nThe following questions naturally arise: 1) Does a quantum correlation\nmaintain between the spins of two particles when the particles move in a\ngravitational field and 2) if it exists, how may this correlation be specified\n(what directions in the two distant regions are correlated)? We shall consider\nthese questions first on the intuitive level and then in the framework of the\npath-integral description of a spinning particle in an external gravitational\nfield (in a curved space-time). The conclusion will be that the correlation is in\nthis case approximate and has to be formulated with the help of the parallel\ntransport along the trajectories (world lines) of the correlated particles.\n\n2\n\nArguments of plausibility\n\nLet in a space-time point O a spin-0 particle decay forming two particles of\nspin 1/2, which then propagate to the space-time points A1 , A2 . If this takes\nplace in the flat (Minkowski) space-time (see Fig. 1 left), then, because of\nthe teleparallelism, a single, globally defined reference frame may be defined\nin the space-time. The axis z chosen in point A1 may correctly be used in\nan arbitrary point in the whole space-time. Therefore, no question arises as\nto what is the z-direction in the point A2 . The correlation between the two\nparticles may be described in terms of this common z-direction as it has been\nmade in Introduction.\nIf however the space-time is curved (Fig. 1 right), then the z-direction\ndefined in a certain manner in point A1 does not determine any z-direction\nin other points, among them in point A2 .\nThe reason for this difficulty is that there is no global notion of the zdirection or more generally of spacial directions or space-time directions.\nSuch notions may be introduced in an arbitrary (space-time) point A with\n3\n\n\fA1\n\nA2\n\nA1\n\nA2\n\nt\nr\n\nO\n\nO\n\nFigure 1: Two spinning particles propagating in the flat (left) or curved\n(right) space-time. In the latter case there is no globally defined notion of\nz-direction. Instead one has to use local frames. However the natural (in\nrespect to the given particles) correspondence between the local frames in\nthe points A1 and A2 may be established by the parallel transport along the\ncurve A1 OA2 consisting of the world lines of the particles.\nthe help of a local frame n, which is a basis of the tangent space to the curved\nspace-time in the given point. However local frames in different points may\nbe chosen independently of each other, so there is no natural correspondence\nbetween the local frame n1 in the point A1 and the local frame n2 in the\npoint A2 .\nThe correlation between the spin projections in the points A1 and A2\ncan be formulated only if some unambiguous correspondence is established\nbetween local frames n1 and n2 in the points A1 and A2 in such a way that\nthe choice of one of them determines the other. This correspondence must be\nbased on some essential features of the physical process under consideration.\nIf a certain curve connecting the points A1 and A2 is chosen, then the\ncorrespondence between n1 and n2 may be established with the help of the\noperation of parallel transport along this curve. It is quite evident that the\nonly relevant curve for this aim is the curve A1 OA2 composed of the world\nlines of the particles, so it is natural to choose this curve for the parallel\ntransport of the local frames.\nThus, it seems plausible that the EPR correlation in a gravitational field\nis the following. Choose an arbitrary local frame n1 in point A1 and define\nthe spin projection of the first particle with respect to the z-axis of this\nlocal frame. Then perform the parallel transport of this local frame to the\n4\n\n\fpoint O along the curve A1 O (the world line of the first particle but passed\nbackwardly in time) and then along the world line OA2 of the second particle\nto the point A2 . A local frame n2 in the point A2 results. Define a spin\nprojection of the second particle with respect to the z-axis of this frame.\nThe correlation formulated in Introduction should exist between the thus\ndefined spin projections.\nThis scheme seems plausible, but of course it must be proved in the\nframework of the dynamical consideration. Particularly, it has to be justified 1) that the operation of parallel transport must be taken to identify\nz-directions in the locations of the two particles and 2) that the curve for\nthis parallel transport must be composed of the world lines of the particles.\nMoreover, in the plausible formulation we used the purely classical notion\nof a world line of a particle which may only approximately be applied in\nthe case of quantum particles. These points will be made more precise in\nthe next section in the course of the dynamical consideration on the basis\nof the path- integral approach. It will be shown that the above-mentioned\ncorrelation may actually arise for particles in a gravitational field, but only\napproximately, if the particles are localized around the points O, A1 , A2 in\nregions which are narrow in comparison with the distances OA1 and OA2 . In\nthe general case the correlation of spin projections emerging in the decay is\ndestroyed during the propagation of the particles in the gravitational field.\n\n3\n\nDynamical proof\n\nIn this section we shall shortly introduce a formalism for the description\nof a relativistic spinning particle moving in a curved space-time. Then this\nformalism will be applied to analyze EPR corralations in a curved space-time.\n\n3.1\n\nThe evolution of a relativistic spinning particle\n\nLet \u03c8(x) (with x being a space-time point) is an arbitrary solution of the\n(covariant) Klein-Gordon (KG) equation and U(x, x\u2032 ) an arbitrary Green\nfunction of this equation:\n(\u2737 + m2 )\u03c8(x) = 0,\n(\u2737 + m2 ) U(x, x\u2032 ) = \u2212i\u03b4(x, x\u2032 ).\n5\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\fThen for an arbitrary four-dimensional region \u03a9 having a characteristic function \u03b7\u03a9 (x) (the function which is equal to unity in \u03a9 and zero outside) the\nfollowing relation holds:\n\u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\n\u2194\n\u2032\n\u03c3 \u03bc U(x, x\u2032 ) \u2207 \u03bc\u2032 \u03c8(x\u2032 ) = \u03b7\u03a9 (x)\u03c8(x).\n\n(4)\n\nHere the three-dimensional integration over the boundary \u2202\u03a9 of \u03a9 is performed with the measure determined by the three-form\n\u03c3\u03bc =\n\n1q\n\u2212g(x) \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03bb dx\u03bd \u2227 dx\u03c3 \u2227 dx\u03bb ,\n6\n\n(5)\n\n\u2194\n\u2207\u03bc is a covariant derivative and \u2207 \u03bc denotes\n\u2194\n\u03c6(x) \u2207 \u03bc \u03c8(x) = \u03c6(x)\u2207\u03bc \u03c8(x) \u2212 (\u2207\u03bc \u03c6(x))\u03c8(x).\nThe relation (4) may be derived from Eq. (3).\nLet \u03a9 be a 4-dimensional region containing the point x and restricted\nby two space-like surfaces, one in the future and the other in the past of\nx. Then the integral (4) is performed over these two surfaces. However for\na positive-frequency solution of the KG equation (describing a particle but\nhaving no counterpart related to an antiparticle)2 and for U(x, x\u2032 ) being the\ncausal propagator the integral over the future surface is zero. Therefore,\nonly the integral over the past surface S survives in this case (this may be\ninterpreted as the property of positive frequencies to propagate only forward\nin time):\nZ\n\u2194\n\u2032\n\u03c8 (+) (x) = i\n\u03c3 \u03bc U(x, x\u2032 ) \u2207 \u03bc\u2032 \u03c8 (+) (x\u2032 ).\n(6)\nS<x\n\nThis is the evolution law for a relativistic particle which may have nonzero spin. To analyze the problem of correlation we need to investigate\nproperties of the propagator U(x, x\u2032 ). We shall do this with the help of the\npath-integral presentation of this propagator.\n2\n\nThe positive-frequency function is defined in the region of interest (where the particle\npropagates) if a time-like Killing vector field exists in this region.\n\n6\n\n\f3.2\n\nThe path integral for the propagator\n\nDifferent and not always equivalent definitions of the path integral in a curved\nspace-time may be given [2, 3, 4]. We shall use the definition of [3] which is\nequivalent to that one in [4].\nIt turns out that it is much simpler to give a path-integral representation\nnot for the causal propagator U(x, x\u2032 ) (which is a 2-point function) but for\nthe corresponding integral operator U defined as follows:\n(U\u03c6)(x) =\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd4 x \u2212g(x) U(x, x\u2032 ) \u03c6(x\u2032 ).\n\n(7)\n\nThe path-integral definition of this operator may be given in the following\nway [3]. First the operator U may be expressed in terms of the operator U\u03c4\ndepending on 'proper time' \u03c4 (which is sometimes called historical time or\nsimply fifth parameter [5]):\nU=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\nd\u03c4 e\u2212im \u03c4 U\u03c4 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe operator U\u03c4 may be expressed in the form of a path integral:\nU\u03c4 =\n\nZ\n\nd[\u03be] e(\u2212i/4)\n\nR\u03c4\n0\n\nd\u03c4 \u03be\u0307 \u03b1 \u03be\u0307\u03b1\n\nD[\u03be].\n\n(9)\n\nHere the integration is carried out over all paths [\u03be] in Minkowski space.\nPaths may be defined as elements of the group of paths (classes of continuous curves) [6] or simply as continuous curves having the fixed initial point\n(say, the origin of Minkowski space) and an arbitrary final point. The covariant displacement operator D[\u03be] is defined as an ordered exponential of the\nintegral along [\u03be]:\n!\nZ\n\nD[\u03be] = P exp\n\n[\u03be]\n\nd\u03be \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 .\n\n(10)\n\nThis is in fact the operator of parallel transport along those curves in the\ncurved space-time which have the curve [\u03be] (in Minkowski space) as their\nevolvent, see [3, 7]. The integral in Eq. (10) includes the operator of the\ncovariant derivative but carrying the Lorentzian index \u03b1 instead of the world\nindex \u03bc :\n(11)\n(\u2207\u03b1 \u03c6)(x) = n\u03bc\u03b1 (x) (\u2207\u03bc \u03c6)(x).\n7\n\n\fThis formula makes use of a field n(x) = {n\u03bc\u03b1 (x)} of local frames (a section of\nthe fiber bundle of orthonormal local frames) which may be chosen arbitrarily\nand then used in this and the subsequent formulas. For the spinning particle\ncorresponding to the representation D of the Lorentz group, the covariant\nderivative \u2207\u03bc with the world index \u03bc is defined as follows3 :\n#\n\n\"\n\n\u2202\nf\n+ D(M\n(\u2207\u03bc \u03c8)(x) =\n\u03bc (x)) \u03c8(x)\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\n(12)\n\nf is the representation of the Lorentzian Lee algebra corresponding\nwhere D\nto the representation D of the Lorentz group.

As a consequence\nof Eq. (13) and the definition (8), the causal propagator U(x, x\u2032 ) satisfies\nEq. (3), i.e., it is a Green function of the KG equation.\n\n3.3\n\nAnalysis of the propagator\n\nWe see that the evolution (6) of the particle is described by the propagator\nwhich is expressed in the form of a path integral by Eqs. (7, 8, 9) containing\nthe operator (10) of parallel transport. Let us assume that the initial state\nof the particle is localized in a rather small region of the spacelike surface\nS which may be, in a reasonable approximation, presented by a single point\n(the point O in Fig. 1) and the final state is also concentrated in a small\nregion (near the point A1 or A2 ) of the corresponding space-like surface.\n3\nWe make use here of the conventional definition of the covariant derivative instead of\nthe equivalent definition in terms of the fiber bundle of local frames which has been used\nin [3]\n\n8\n\n\fIt is known that the main contribution to the path integral is given by\nthose paths which are close to geodesic lines (this is valid if the initial and\nfinal points are not too close to each other). Let us assume (this assumption\nwill be discussed later) that the uncertainties of the position in the initial and\nin the final state of each particle are small in comparison with the distance\nbetween its initial and final positions. Then all the paths which substantially\ncontribute to the path integral for the given particle are close to the same\ngeodesic, namely the geodesic line connecting the point of the initial localization O of the particle with the point of its final localization (A1 or A2 ). Let\nus denote the corresponding geodesics as \u03b31 =OA1 and \u03b32 =OA2 . Therefore,\nall paths essentially contributing to the evolution of the particle are close to\n\u03b31 for the first particle and close to \u03b32 for the second particle.\nThe contribution of each path in Eq. (9) is expressed through the parallel\ntransport along this path. For the paths giving the main contribution (close\nto the geodesic \u03b31 or \u03b32 ) the corresponding parallel transports are close to the\nparallel transport along the corresponding geodesic, \u03b31 for the first particle\nand \u03b32 for the second particle. Therefore, we are led to the following conclusion: If the initial spin state of the particle is described by a function referred\nto some local frame n0 in the initial point O, then the final spin state is approximately described by the same function but referred to the local frame\n(in the final point A1 or A2 ) which is obtained from n0 by the parallel transport along the corresponding geodesic \u03b31 or \u03b32 . Let us denote the resulting\nlocal frames n1 for the first particle and n2 for the second particle.\nSumming up, the spin state of the first particle in the final point A1 is\ndescribed by the same function as in the initial point O but if the initial spin\nstate refers to the local frame n0 and the final spin state refers to the local\nframe n1 obtained from n0 by parallel transport along \u03b31 . The same is valid\nalso for the second particle, but with n2 and \u03b32 instead of n1 and \u03b31 .4\nThis evidently justifies the statement made in Sect. 2 about EPR correlations in a gravitational field. Indeed, the correlation between spin states\n4\n\nThis statement may be technically elaborated, most conveniently with the help of\nwave functions defined as functions on the fiber bundle of local frames. A spin state of\na localized particle may be described by a function on the corresponding fiber of local\nframes in the point of localization. If a reference local frame is given, then the function\non the fiber (representing the spin state) is reduced to the function on the Lorentz group.\nThe same function on the Lorentz group but referring to the parallelly transported local\nframe will present the final spin state of the particle.\n\n9\n\n\fof the two particles is formed at the moment of their formation at a single\npoint O. Then the particles propagate to different points A1 , A2 . If this\npropagation may, in a good approximation, be presented as the propagation\nof the localized states along the geodesics \u03b31 and \u03b32 , then the spin state of\neach particle will be parallelly transported into the new point of localization\nalong the corresponding geodesic. The correlation of the initial spin states\nis described with reference to the same local frame n0 (at the point O which\nis common for both particles). Therefore the correlation between the final\nspin states must be described in just the same way but with reference to the\nparallelly translated local frames (correspondingly n1 and n2 ). The relation\nbetween these local frames is evident: n2 may be obtained from n1 by the\nparallel transport backward along the world line OA1 =\u03b31 of the first particle\n(which results in n0 ) and then forward along the world line OA2 =\u03b32 of the\nsecond particle. Finally n2 is the parallel transport of n1 along the curve\nA1 OA2 =(\u03b31 )\u22121 \u03b32 .\nThe preceding conclusions were based on the assumption that the initial\nstate of each particle is localized in a rather small region and the propagation of each particle may, in a good appoximation, be presented by a single\npath coinciding with the corresponding geodesic line. Let us discuss this\nassumption.\nAt the first glance it is hardly possible to justify the assumption that the\nevolution of each particle may be accurately enough presented by only one\ngeodesic \u03b31 or \u03b32 . Indeed, because of the uncertainty of the initial linear\nmomentum the localization in the final point is poorer than it is in the initial\npoint; the longer period of propagation the poorer the localization. The\nparticle may be considered localized about the final point A1 or A2 only if\nthe period of propagation is rather short. However for a short period of\nevolution it is impossible to neglect the paths which strongly deviate from\ngeodesics. This leads to a contradiction which hardly may be resolved.\nIn this latter argument we refer to the final localization which is the result\nof the free evolution. This localization is poor because of the spreading\nof the wave packet. However, what we really need is the localization of\nthe particles in the measurement here under consideration. Let not only\nthe spin projections, but simultaneously with this the coordinates of the\nparticles are measured. Then the resulting uncertainty of the coordinate will\nbe determined by the precision of the measurement of the coordinate. In\nother words, in the process of the measurement of the spin projection the\n10\n\n\fparticle may be localized in an arbitrarily narrow region about the point A1\nor A2 (these points are determined only in the process of this localization\nduring the measurement of the spin projections). In this case only those\npaths in the path integral are relevant which lead to this region. We may\nconclude then that only a rather narrow bunch of paths contributes to that\ncomponent of the state which is essential for the analysis. If the region of\nthe final localization is narrow enough, then all relevant paths are close to\nthe corresponding geodesic (\u03b31 or \u03b32 ), so the assumption we have accepted\nin the analysis of the spin corelation is justified.\nThis completes the dynamical proof of the statement which has been\nfromulated in Sect. 2 on the basis of plausible arguments.\nIt is of course possible that one meets another situation when the assumption taken above is invalid. Let the localization of the particles (initially or\nfinally or both) be not enough strong to justify the approximation of a single path. Then we have to apply a more strict approximation taking into\naccount more than one path of propagation of each particle. In this case the\ninitial correlation between the spin projections of the two particles (necessarily resulting in the decay of a scalar particle) is destroyed in the course of the\npropagation. The longer the propagation and the stronger the gravitational\nfield, the poorer is the correlation. In general the EPR correlation between\nspin projections does not exist.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe conclusion drawn from the previous consideration may be formulated as\nfollows. What is usually called quantum non-locality (or the correlation of\nthe EPR type) is in fact a correlation between the results of the measurements of two spatially separated systems. However this apparently non-local\nphenomenon is preceded by 1) establishing the correlation between the two\nsystems in a single point O (locally) and then 2) bringing the correlated\nsystems to the separated points A1 and A2 during the evolution (propagation). Both operations are local. Thus, the final correlation is prepared in\nthe course of the local processes.\nThis is made explicit by the above consideration of the EPR effect in an\nexternal gravitational field. We have seen that the spin states of the particles\nin the points A1 and A2 are correlated if they are referred to such local frames\n11\n\n\fn1 and n2 in these points that n2 results from the parallel transport of n1\nalong the line A1 OA2 consisting of the two geodesics, OA1 and OA2 .\nThus, in the case of the gravitational field (when there is no teleparallelism) the very specification of the correlation may be made only in terms\nof the world lines (classical trajectories) of the particles (essentially local\nobjects). In general no EPR correlation exists in a gravitational field. The\nreason for this is that different local processes (essentially different paths)\nare coherently superposed.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe work was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\nunder grant 436 RUS 17/1/99.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
