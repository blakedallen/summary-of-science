However, the effect of Fe doping on\nthe superconducting properties of MgB2 remains controversial. In this work, we present results of nanoscale Fe particle doping in to MgB2. The Fe doping experiments were performed using both bulk and\nthin film form.

There is no evidence for Fe substitution for Mg. The transition\ntemperature decreased modestly with increasing Fe doping levels. The Jc(H) performance was severely\ndepressed at above 3wt% doping level. The detrimental effect of nano-scale Fe doping on both Tc and\nJc(H) is attributable to the grain decoupling as a result of magnetic scattering of Fe-containing dopants\nat grain boundaries.\nIntroduction\nThe topic of Fe doping into high temperature superconductors (HTS) has been extensively studied and\na large number of papers published in the literature. This is because Fe can substitute into the Cu site in\ncuprates up to 1/3 of Cu without phase segregation. It was also of interest to study the effect of the\nferromagnetism of Fe on the superconductivity. There is a fair amount of agreement on the effect on\nthe superconducting characteristics of doping Fe into a given cuprate. A typical example of an HTS\ncompounds for the study of the effect of Fe doping is YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO). In this case, the\ndepression of superconductivity is largely attributable to the Cu valence and structure change rather\nthan any magnetic property change as a result of Fe doping [1]. It is interesting to note that the effects\non Tc by magnetic (e.g. Fe) and non-magnetic element (e.g. Zn) are comparable for YBCO while the\ndominating factors are the structure change, oxygen content and Cu site where substitution takes place,\non a Cu plane or in a Cu chain.\nIn contrast, there is little work on the effect of Fe doping on the superconducting behavior of MgB2.\nThis is largely due to the fact that Fe is relatively inert to MgB2 and has been widely used as a sheath\nmaterial for fabrication of metal-clad MgB2 wire and tapes. However, the magnetism of Fe doping as\nan additive may have a significant effect on the superconductivity of MgB2. This effect could be more\ndramatic if the Fe additives are at nano-scale. Jin et al. have studied the effect of Fe addition on Tc and\nthe Jc \u2013 H characteristics of MgB2 [2]. They found that 5wt% Fe addition had no effect on Tc and a\nnegative effect on Jc. However, it had the least negative effect on Jc \u2013 H behavior of all the elements\nthey studied, including Cu, Ag, Y, Ti, and Mo. From their results using Mossbauer spectroscopy and\nXRD, Kuzmann et al suggested that Fe substitutes into the Mg site in the MgB2 lattice, resulting in\nmodest depression in Tc [3]. These authors did not study the effect of Fe doping on Jc(H). Recently,\nProzorov et al. applied a sonication method to produce magnetic Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in the\nMgB2 bulk, resulting in a superconductor-ferromagnetic composite which exhibited enhancement of\nthe magnetic hysteresis due to the improved vortex pinning by the magnetic nanoparticles [4]. In\n1\n\n\fconventional superconductors, submicron magnetic dots in a specially designed pattern have been used\nas artificial pinning centers in superconductor thin films [5,6]. Because of the important role of Fe as a\ncommonly used sheath material for the fabrication of MgB2 there is an urgent need to clarify the effects\nof Fe doping on the superconducting properties, in particular on the flux pinning.\nIn this article, we present results on the effects of nano-scale Fe doping in both bulk and thin film on\nthe lattice structure, Tc and Jc \u2013 H characteristics of MgB2. The results from both bulk and thin films\ndemonstrate that nano-Fe doping modestly depressed Tc and severely damaged the Jc in-field\nperformance. There is no evidence to suggest that Fe particles act as pinning centres. We interpret this\nnegative effect of Fe doping on Jc(H) in terms of magnetic scattering by Fe dopants.\nExperimental details\nMgB2 pellet samples were prepared by an in-situ reaction method, described in detail previously\n[7]. Powders of magnesium (99%) and amorphous boron (99%) were well mixed with Fe nanoparticle\npowder (spherical morphology, size 25nm and surface area 40-60 m2/g) with the atomic ratio of MgB2\nand with 0, 1, 5wt% Fe addition. Pellets 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness made under a\nuniaxial pressure were sealed in an Fe tube and then heated at 800oC for 30min in flowing high purity\nAr, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature.\nThe Fe doped MgB2 thin films were prepared using a pulsed laser deposition technique with the ex\nsitu annealing described previously [8]. In this procedure, a boron precursor film was deposited from a\nboron target in 10-7-10-6 Torr vacuum. For Fe doping, a target-switching method was employed. In this\nmethod, two targets were mounted onto a carousel. They were a boron target (84% density) and an iron\ntarget, respectively. The Fe added B precursor film was achieved by sequentially ablating the B and the\nFe target 10 times during the deposition. In each round, the Fe target was ablated for 2 pulses at 1 Hz\nlaser repetition frequency, and the B target was ablated for 30 sec at 10Hz. We calibrated the growth\nrate of Fe film and B film under our deposition conditions and controlled the number of laser pulses on\neach target to make the Fe content in the final ex situ annealed MgB2 film equal to 3 wt%. The\nsubstrate was also kept at 250oC during the deposition. The precursor film was then wrapped with Ta\nfoil and sealed in a stainless steel tube in Ar atmosphere together with Mg pellets. The tube was put\ninto a 900oC furnace and kept for 30min. The heating rate and cooling rates are both about 180oC/min.\nMagnetization was measured from 5 to 30 K in magnetic fields up to 9 T using a 9 T Physical\nProperty Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). Bar-shaped samples of about the same size\nwere cut from the as-sintered pellets to minimize size-dependent effects [9]. Magnetic Jc values were\ndetermined from the magnetization hysteresis loops using the appropriate critical state model. An\nempirical magnetic irreversibility line Hirr was defined as the field at which Jc falls to 100 A/cm2.\nLattice structure and phase compositions were examined using XRD and transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the morphology of the samples.\nResults and Discussion:\nFig. 1 shows XRD patterns for the Fe doped and un-doped bulk samples with pure Si as the\nstandard. The XRD pattern for the un-doped sample is consistent with the published indices of MgB2\nwith a trace amount of MgO. For the Fe doped samples, at an Fe doping level of 2wt% or above, FeB\nphase is clearly seen as one of main impurities along with MgO and unreacted Mg. The presence of the\nunreacted Mg is due to the formation of FeB which caused a deficiency of B. Because of the reaction\nbetween B and Fe a sample with the nominal composition of Mg0.96Fe0.04B2 (Fe doping level equal to\n5wt%) was made in the same way in order to maintain the stoichiometry of MgB2. However, there is no\n2\n\n\fsignificant difference between the XRD patterns of this sample and that with 5wt% Fe addition. From\nthe XRD pattern we cannot detect any free Fe presence in the Fe doped samples. To confirm the FeB\ncompound formation during the doping process, we intentionally added more nano-Fe. With a further\nincrease of Fe doping level to 10wt%, in addition to FeB a new compound of Fe2B was detected.\nFig. 2 shows the transition temperature (Tc) for the doped and un-doped samples determined by ac\nsusceptibility measurements. For thin film samples, the Tc showed little difference between the 3wt%\nFe doped sample and the un-doped one. For the pellet samples, the Tc obtained as the onset of magnetic\nscreening for the un-doped sample was 38.6K with a transition width of 1.1K. For the doped samples,\nthe Tc decreased with increasing doping level and the transition became broad. Tc drops by 4.6K with a\ntransition width of 7.9K at the Fe doping level of 5wt%. For the sample with the nominal composition\nof Mg0.96Fe0.04B2 (equal to 5wt% Fe addition) it's the Tc was 35.6 K, 3 K lower than for the un-doped\nsample. In comparison with substitution cases such as C and Al, the effect of Fe doping on Tc is not too\ndrastic. However, compared with other non-magnetic additives the depression of Tc by Fe doping is\nslightly stronger. For example, Tc only drops by 1.3K at a doping level of 15wt.% nano SiC in MgB2\n[7] and by 1.5K at 10wt% of nano-Si doping [10]. This indicates that the depression of Tc by nano-Fe\ndoping is attributable to magnetic scattering by the ferromagnetic particles.\nFig. 3 shows the Jc(H) curves for the un-doped and Fe-doped MgB2 samples at 20K for different\ndoping levels. It should be noted that the Fe doping not only depressed the zero field Jc but also\ndamaged the Jc(H) behaviour in magnetic fields. At a 5wt% Fe doping level, the Hirr (as defined as the\nfield value at Jc = 100A/cm2) dropped from 4.7T to 1.9T at 20K. For the sample with the nominal\ncomposition of Mg0.96Fe0.04B2 the Jc(H) performance is better than with 5wt% doping, but follows the\nsame trend. To confirm the negative effect of Fe doping on Jc(H), we present the Jc(H) results of the\n3wt% Fe doped MgB2 thin film in Fig. 4. It is clear that the Jc(H) performance in magnetic field was\nseverely depressed due to the Fe doping, consistent with the bulk samples. Because the Fe doped thin\nfilms were made using the pulsed laser deposition technique there is no doubt that the Fe particle size is\nat nanometer scale and Fe distribution is highly uniform within the MgB2 matrix.\nDiscussion:\nIn contrast to HTS, MgB2 has a relatively large coherence length and small anisotropy. Accordingly\nthe fluxoids to be pinned are string-like and amenable to pinning by particles, precipitates, etc. This\nopens a window to the success of chemical doping in this material. Many additives (reactive or nonreactive to MgB2), such as Si [10], Y2O3 [11], Ti, Zr [12], ZrSi2, WSi2, ZrB2, Mg2Si, and SiO2 [13]\nhave been reported to have a positive effect on flux pinning. Under controlled conditions, some\nsubstitution elements such as C [14], SiC [7] and Al [15] have shown a significant enhancement in Hc2\nand Jc(H) performance. Only a few dopants, such as Cu, showed any negative effect because of strong\nreaction with Mg. It is particularly interesting to note that many of these dopants such as SiC, Si, Y2O3,\nTi, and Zr have shown an enhancement effect on flux pinning even though they actively reacted with\neither B or Mg to form compounds. In comparison, the nano-particle Fe doping has a dramatic\ndepressing effect on Jc(H). Our results are not in agreement with a recent report which claiming that\nfine Fe2O3 particles acted as efficient pinning centres to enhance Jc [4]. Our findings also do not\nsupport those studies using an array of magnetic dots in low temperature superconductor films [5,6]. It\nshould, however, be pointed out that the latter case is quite different from our experimental conditions.\nTheir Fe dots were designed to be spaced of 600nm apart and to have a dot size of 100nm, while our Fe\nparticles were smaller and the space between them was much smaller and randomly distributed. Also,\ntheir thin films were made of Nb and tested in a very low field regime (< 0.15T).\nThe possible mechanisms for such a negative effect on Jc(H) are proposed to be (1) Fe substitution\nfor Mg which was not found in our study as discussed above; and (2) magnetic scattering of Fe\nparticles that caused depression of superconductivity and weak links at grain boundaries. Kuzmann et\n3\n\n\fal. [3] and Guo et al. [16] suggested possible Fe substitution in the Mg site in the MgB2 lattice [3].\nBecause these techniques were applied to an entire sample the claim of Fe substitution for Mg was\ninconclusive. In the present study, we found no convincing evidence of Fe substitution for Mg. If Fe\nsubstituted for Mg we would see a change in the lattice parameter as a result of Fe doping because the\nFe+3 ion radius (0.55A) is much smaller than Mg+2 (0.72A). However, we found no change in the lattice\nparameters with increasing Fe doping level. Fig. 5 shows a comparison between the XRD patterns of\nthe un-doped and 5wt% doped samples. The insets show the (001) and (002) peaks for the two samples.\nThere is no sign of a shift in these peaks even though we used a very slow scan rate. This indicates that\nthere were no changes in a- and c- axis lattice parameters due to Fe doping. Furthermore, as FeB peaks\nwere clearly visible even at a 2wt% Fe doping level it is evident that the Fe is largely in the form of\nFeB rather than in the form of any substitution. However, it should be pointed out that we cannot\ncompletely rule out Fe substitution for Mg as the current techniques have a limited detection level.\nTEM examination and EDS analysis revealed the following features of Fe doped sample. Fe\ncontaining particles are uniformly dispersed within the matrix with no indication of agglomerates. Fig 6\nshows TEM images of a 5wt% Fe doped sample. In one case round and dark pure Fe particles of 4050nm size were observed at grain boundaries as shown by the arrow in Fig. 6 (a). Some pure Fe\nparticles of approximately 20nm in size were also observed in this sample (arrows in Fig. 6(b)). FeB\nparticles are also another type of Fe containing particles observed in this experiment as shows for\nexample in Fig. 6 (c). As can be seen, FeB particles are much larger (about 100 nm) and are highly\ntwinned while normal Fe does not have such a high density of twins. The FeB is characterized by\nelectron diffraction and energy dispersion X-ray analysis (EDS). Due to the large difference between\nthe size of pure Fe particles and the size of FeB particles and the small number of pure Fe particles, the\nvolume fraction of FeB would be significantly higher than pure Fe, which is consistent with the results\nof XRD where only FeB is detected. EDS analysis of the MgB2 grains showed a small peak of Fe, but\nthis again may be from Fe containing compounds as the grain size of MgB2 is very small, about 100nm.\nThus far, the evidence for Fe substitution for Mg remains inconclusive.\nBecause of the large coherence length of MgB2 many nano-particles at grain boundaries do not\ncause weak links but act as effective pinning centres which has been well demonstrated by a number of\ndoping studies [7, 9-15]. In the case of Fe doping, FeB particles at grain boundaries cause grain\ndecoupling because FeB particle scattering affects a much larger volume surrounding the particle than\nnonmagnetic particles. Thus, the superconductor volume decreaded with increasing Fe doping level,\nresulting in the reduction in zero field Jc. With larger amounts of Fe, the layer decoupling the grains\nwas thicker, Fe containing compounds become weak links rather than flux pinning centres. This is a\ntypical characteristic for HTS in which weak links are the dominating factor for current flow. We do\nnot have this weak link characteristics even at higher doping levels for non-magnetic dopants [16].\n20%SiC addition to MgB2 not only showed no such weak link feature but had a strong enhancement\neffect on Jc(H) [17]. Especially we should stress that SiC also strongly reacted with Mg to form Mg2Si\nand all the additives and reaction products stay at grain boundaries. It is evident that MgB2 is highly\ntolerant of nonmagnetic impurities but susceptible to ferromagnetic impurities.\nAlthough the Fe doping showed a negative effect on both Tc and Jc(H) this negative effect may not\nbe too drastic in an Fe sheath situation as the contact area between the Fe sheath and the MgB2 is much\nsmaller than the case of nano-Fe particle doping. The reaction between Fe and B is only limited in the\ninterface region. Moreover, the reactivity of Fe is much lower than that of many elements such as Cu,\nAg, Ti, etc. In addition, the ferromagnetic property of the Fe sheath provides a magnetic shielding\neffect that enhances the Jc(H) performance in a low field regime as reported previously [18]. This\npositive effect of magnetic shielding counterbalances the small negative effect of the Fe sheath on\nJc(H).\n\n4\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that nano-scale Fe particle doping depressed both Tc and Jc(H)\nin both bulk and thin film samples. Because of their high reactivity, in the in-situ process the nanoscale Fe particles reacted with B to form FeB and Fe2B which were homogenously distributed within\nthe matrix of bulk and thin film MgB2. Fe substitution for Mg is unlikely but remains inconclusive. The\nstrong depression in Jc(H) performance by nano-Fe particle doping is attributable to the decoupling\neffect of Fe-containing particles within the grains and at grain boundaries.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors thank M.
