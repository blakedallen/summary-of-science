China\n\nAbstract:\nHere we report a new quaternary iron-arsenide superconductor Nd[O1-xFx]FeAs, with the onset\nresistivity transition at 51.9 K and Meissner transition at 51 K. This compound has the same\ncrystal structure as LaOFeAs, and becomes the second superconductor after Pr[O1-xFx]FeAs that\nsuperconducts above 50 K.\n\n1\n\n\fThe recently discovered quaternary arsenide oxide superconductor La[O1-xFx]FeAs with the\nsuperconducting critical transition temperature (Tc) of 26 K [1], has been quickly expanded to\nanother family of high-T c superconducting systems besides copper oxides by the replacement of\nLa with other rare earth elements, such as Sm, Ce, and Pr etc. [2-4], where the Pr[O1-xFx]FeAs\nthat synthesized under high pressure has become the first non-cuprate superconductor having a Tc\nabove 50 K. All these arsenide (including phosphide) superconductors formed in the same\ntetragonal layered structure with the space group P4/nmm that has an alternant stacked Fe-As\nlayer and RO (R = rare earth metals) layer. Here we report the discovery of a new superconductor\nin this family, the neodymium-arsenide Nd[O1-xFx]FeAs with a resistivity onset Tc of 51.9 K,\nwhich is the second non-cuprate compound that superconducts above 50 K.\nThe superconducting Nd[O1-xFx]FeAs samples were prepared by a high pressure synthesis\nmethod directly. Nd pieces, As, Fe, Fe2O3, FeF3 powders (the purities of all starting chemicals are\nbetter than 99.99%) were mixed together according to the nominal stoichiometric ratio of\nNd[O0.89F0.11]FeAs, then ground thoroughly and pressed into small pellets. The pellets were\nsealed in boron nitride crucibles and sintered in a high pressure synthesis apparatus under the\npressure of 6 GPa and temperature of 1300oC for 2 hours. Here the adoption of high pressure\nsynthesis is mainly due to the severe fluorine loss that we observed when using the common\nvacuum quartz tube seal method [1]. The press-seal of high pressure synthesis is better for\nsynthesizing gas-releasing compound, while the disadvantage is that the short synthesis time and\nunstable condition are difficult for producing single-phase sample. The structure of the samples\nwas characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on an MXP18A-HF type\ndiffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation from 20o to 80o with a step of 0.01o.\nThe XRD patterns indicate that all samples include mixed phases, while the main phase adopts\nthe same PrOFeAs structure as shown in Fig. 1. The impurity phases have been determined to be\nthe known oxides, arsenides, and fluorides that are formed by starting chemicals, which do not\nsuperconduct at the measuring temperature. The existence of impurity phases is due to the\ninsufficient synthesis time that can be tolerated by our high-pressure apparatus. Comparing with\nthe Pr[O0.89F0.11]FeAs superconductor, the right-shifted XRD peaks indicate a shrinkage of lattice\nparameters for this Nd[O0.89F0.11]FeAs superconductor. A detailed study of the superconducting\nphase diagram will be reported later.\nThe resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe method. The results are shown in Fig. 2.\nA clear resistivity drop was observed as the temperature is down to 51.9 K, and the resistivity was\n2\n\n\funmeasurable below 48.8 K. The middle of the superconducting transition is at 50.1 K.\nComparing with Pr[O0.89F0.11]FeAs superconductor, the Tc (zero) increases about 5 K while the Tc\n(onset) has no obvious change. Currently we believe that the chemical pressure caused by the\nshrinkage of crystal lattice promotes the increase of T c [5], which is indeed observed by our series\nof superconducting samples with different rare earth metal substitutions. This observation is also\nconsistent with a theoretical expectation proposed in Ref. [6], where it is indicated that the Tc may\nbe enhanced by the increase of hopping integral, which can be achieved by the shrinkage of the\nlattice.\nThe magnetization measurements were performed on a Quantum Design MPMS XL-1 system\nduring warming cycle under fixed magnetic field after zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling\n(FC) process. The AC-susceptibility data (with the measuring frequency of 997.3 Hz and the\namplitude of 0.3 Oe) and DC-susceptibility data (measured under a magnetic field of 1 Oe) are\nshown in Fig. 3 (we note that the background is caused by magnetic impurities). The sharp\nmagnetic transitions on both of AC and DC susceptibility curves indicate the good quality of this\nsuperconducting component. The onset diamagnetic transition determined from the differential\nZFC curve is 51 K, which is a little higher than that of Pr[O0.89F0.11]FeAs superconductor. Since\ncurrently the best synthesis condition for this superconducting system is in exploring, a higher Tc\nin this family is still expected.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nWe thank Mrs. Shun-Lian Jia for her kind helps in resistivity measurements.
