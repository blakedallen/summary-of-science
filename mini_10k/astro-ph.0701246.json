INTRODUCTION\n\nWe seek clues to the stellar origin of long-duration\nGamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) by comparing the chemical abundances at the sites of the broad- lined Type Ic\nsupernovae (SN Ic) that accompany some GRB with the\nbroad-lined SN Ic that have no observed GRB. In nearby\nGRB, after the afterglow has faded, if the spectrum of\nthe underlying event is observed, it is that of a broadlined SN Ic (e.g., Galama et al. 1998; Stanek et al. 2003;\nHjorth et al. 2003; Modjaz et al. 2006). These are supernovae whose spectra show no trace of hydrogen or of\n\u2217 THIS\n\nPAPER INCLUDES DATA GATHERED WITH THE\nMMT OBSERVATORY, A JOINT FACILITY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, AND WITH THE 6.5 METER MAGELLAN TELESCOPES LOCATED AT LAS CAMPANAS OBSERVATORY,\nCHILE.\n1 Department of Astronomy, UC Berkeley, 601 Campbell Hall,\nBerkeley, CA, 94704; mmodjaz@astro.berkeley.edu\n2 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden\nStreet, Cambridge, MA, 02138; kirshner,pchallis@cfa.harvard.edu.\n3 Hubble Fellow.\n4 University of Hawaii, 2680 Woodlawn Drive, Honolulu, HI\n96822;kewley@IfA.Hawaii.Edu.\n5 Department of Astronomy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;kstanek,prieto@astronomy.ohio-state.edu.\n6 Department of Physics, 225 Nieuwland Science Hall, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556; pgarnavi@nd.edu.\n7 Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University, Peyton Hall, Ivy Lane, Princeton, NJ 08544-1001;\njgreene@astro.princeton.edu.\n8 Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, 2575\nSand Hill Road, MS 29, Menlo Park, CA 94025\n\nhelium and whose line widths approach 30,000 km s\u22121\n(e.g., Galama et al. 1998; Patat et al. 2001; Pian et al.\n2006). Type Ic supernovae with broad lines are also seen\nwithout an accompanying GRB. We have studied these\nobjects, and their hosts, to try to learn more about the\nconditions that lead a massive star to have the special\nkind of core collapse that leads to the formation of a jet\nand a GRB (see Woosley & Bloom 2006 for a review).\nSome models of core collapse in massive stars produced to match these spectra have large kinetic energies (EK > 1052 erg; Iwamoto et al. 1998; Mazzali et al.\n2003), and thus, have led to the use of the term \"Hypernova\". However, since the computed EK are modeldependent (Maeda et al. 2006) and for some cases not\nnecessarily larger than those of normal core-collapse SN\n(Mazzali et al. 2006a), we prefer to use names that reflect the directly observed properties, without any implication on the overall energy budget for the event. Thus,\nwe call them \"broad-lined SN Ic\", and abbreviated as\n\"SN Ic (broad)\", and for comparison, we henceforth call\nand abbreviate broad-lined SN Ic associated with GRB\nas \"SN Ic (broad & GRB)\" (see \u00a7 2.2).\nA number of studies have been conducted on\nthe environments of GRBs to help constrain their\nprogenitors.\nObservations of host galaxies of\nnearby GRBs (z <0.25) indicate that they are\nfaint, blue, star-forming galaxies with low metallicities9 (Prochaska et al. 2004; Sollerman et al. 2005;\n9\n\nHere we refer to the term \"metallicity\" as represented by the\n\n\f2\nModjaz et al. 2006; Stanek et al. 2006; Thoene et al.\n2006; Wiersema et al. 2007; Margutti et al. 2007). Studies of GRB hosts at cosmological distances draw a similar\nconclusion (Fruchter et al. 1999; Le Floc'h et al. 2003;\nFynbo et al. 2003; Fruchter et al. 2006): GRB hosts\ntend to be consistently dimmer and more irregular than\ngalaxies that host core-collapse SN at comparable redshifts and GRBs appear concentrated in the highest\nsurface brightness areas of their blue hosts. In addition, Kewley et al. (2007) and Brown et al. (2007) have\ndiscovered a number of extremely metal poor galaxies that do not follow the regular galaxy luminositymetallicity (hereafter L \u2212 Z) relationship (Garnett 2002;\nTremonti et al. 2004), just like the nearby GRB host\ngalaxies. For the same MB , they are more metalpoor than Irregulars, normal Blue Compact Galaxies and normal star-forming galaxies (see also Figure\n3 in Savaglio et al. 2006 for a similar trend for hosts\nof higher z GRBs). Thus, based on observations,\nFruchter et al. (2006) and Stanek et al. (2006) argue that\nlow metallicity is required for GRB progenitors, in line\nwith theoretical GRB models that suggest rapidly rotating massive stars at low metallicity (Hirschi et al.\n2005; Yoon & Langer 2005; Woosley & Heger 2006;\nLanger & Norman 2006) as likely progenitors. Low\nmetallicity seems to be a promising route for some\nstars to avoid losing angular momentum from mass\nloss (Vink & de Koter 2005; Crowther & Hadfield 2006).\nHigh angular momentum and a massive core are key\ningredients for producing a GRB jet. If the abundances in the star are low enough, then hydrogen\nand helium can mix into the burning zones of the\nstar, leading to a star with low hydrogen and helium abundances and a large core mass just before explosion (Hirschi et al. 2005; Yoon & Langer 2005;\nWoosley & Heger 2006; Langer & Norman 2006). This\nmechanism for producing a gamma-ray burst seems plausible for producing a broad-lined SN Ic at the same time,\nas observed.\nHowever, the SN Ic that are observed to erupt without\na GRB may provide essential clues to complete this picture. If low metal abundance always accompanies jet formation in the core collapse of massive stars, then broadline SN Ic intrinsically without GRBs should be found in\nmetal-rich galaxies. This is the hypothesis we test here,\nusing the available list of broad-lined SN Ic and our own\nuniform determinations of the local metal abundance.\nThough the present sample is small, it is intriguing, and\nwe look forward to future discoveries that can test the\nconclusions presented here.\nAfter the discovery of SN 1997ef, around 15 additional\nbroad-lined SN Ic were discovered, which have spectroscopic properties similar to the broad-lined SN Ic-GRB\nwhen studied in detail. Studying the full class of broadlined SN Ic may help us understand the mechanism for\nproducing jet-driven explosions. Since these SN are more\nfrequent than nearby GRBs, we may gain clues more\nrapidly than waiting for the detection of the next nearby\nGRB. Three of the nearby SN-GRB have gamma-ray\nenergies 2\u22124 orders of magnitude lower compared to\ncosmological ones and might belong to a different class\ngas-phase oxygen abundance, and use these two terms interchangibly. See \u00a7 5.1 for details.\n\nof GRBs that is much more frequent (by a factor of\n102 \u2212 103 ), but not observable at high z due to their low\ngamma-ray energies (Cobb et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2006;\nGuetta & Della Valle 2006). Thus, it is still worthwhile\nto investigate the specific conditions which give rise to\nlow-z GRBs, even if those insights cannot be directly\napplied to cosmological, high-energy GRBs.\nPrevious work has investigated the metallicity dependence of GRBs; however these studies\n(Wolf & Podsiadlowski 2007) are based on indirect\nmeasures of galaxy metallicity. Not only do these\nrelations contain significant scatter (Tremonti et al.\n2004), but there is evidence that the L \u2212 Z relation is no\nlonger linear at very low metallicity for certain galaxies\n(Kewley et al. 2007; Brown et al. 2007; Kniazev et al.\n2003). In this paper, we present the measured metallicities of a statistically significant sample of broad-lined\nSN Ic environments, derived in the same fashion, with\nwhich the SN-GRB host sample should be and will be\ncompared. This study constitutes the first of its kind\nfor core-collapse supernovae.\nIn \u00a7 2.1 we summarize the sample of broad-lined SN\nIc with GRBs from the literature, while in \u00a7 2.2 we introduce our sample of local broad-lined SN Ic and their\nhosts and discuss the role of selection effects in \u00a7 2.3. We\nthen present the spectroscopic observations in \u00a7 3 and\nderive galaxy parameters in \u00a7 4. We discuss our results\nand their implications in \u00a7 5 and summarize in \u00a7 6. In\nthis paper, we adopt the following values of the cosmological parameters: Ho = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3,\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n2. SN HOST GALAXY SAMPLES\n\n2.1. Sample of Broad-lined SN Ic with GRBs and their\nHosts\nThere are currently four nearby secure cases of\ndirect SN-GRB associations: the temporal and spatial\ncoincidence between SN 1998bw and GRB 980425\n(Galama et al. 1998) and the metamorphosis of the\nGRB afterglow spectra into that of a supernovae\nfor the following SN-GRB: GRB 030329/SN 2003dh\n(Stanek et al. 2003; Hjorth et al. 2003; Matheson et al.\n2003); GRB 031203/SN 2003lw (Malesani et al. 2004;\nMazzali et al. 2006b); GRB/XRF 060218/SN 2006aj\n(Modjaz et al. 2006; Pian et al. 2006; Mazzali et al.\n2006a; Campana et al. 2006; Mirabal et al. 2006;\nSollerman et al. 2006; Cobb et al. 2006).\nWe also\ninclude the host of XRF 020903, that had a clear\nsupernova signature in its light curve (Bersier et al.\n2006) and in its afterglow spectrum (Soderberg et al.\n2005), but we do note that this SN confirmation has a\nlower degree of certainty than the other GRB-SN associations.10 The nearby SN connected with GRBs have\nbeen well-observed and in all cases, their host-galaxy\nproperties and emission line fluxes measured. We list in\nTable 1 the SN-GRB sample, and the references include\npublished host galaxy emission line fluxes which we\ndirectly use when deriving metallicities in \u00a7 5.1. While\nthere are certain conditions that might favor detecting\ncertain SN spectroscopically in GRB afterglows (e.g.,\n10 There is some evidence of spectroscopically confirmed\nsupernovae for other GRBs, however with less confidence\n(Della Valle et al. 2003; see Woosley & Bloom 2006 for a full list).\n\n\f3\ngood burst localization, weak GRB afterglow, low\nredshift), a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of\nthis paper, and we refer the reader to the discussion in\nWoosley & Bloom (2006).\n2.2. Sample of Broad-lined SN Ic and their Hosts\nIn our study, we include the host galaxies of the four\nbroad-lined SN Ic which are well-documented in the literature and whose properties have been observed and modeled: SN 1997ef and SN 1997dq (Iwamoto et al. 2000),\nSN 2002ap (e.g., Gal-Yam et al. 2002; Mazzali et al.\n2002; Foley et al. 2003), and SN 2003jd (Mazzali et al.\n2005). We also include SN 2003bg, which was classified\nas a broad-lined SN Ic (Filippenko & Chornock 2003). It\nthen developed P Cygni absorption features of hydrogen\n(Hamuy et al. 2003), but did not display any H emission in late-time spectra as expected in Type II SN (M.\nHamuy et al., in prep.). Thus, we count SN 2003bg as a\nbroad-lined SN Ic, with some hydrogen possibly due to\nISM interactions (Soderberg et al. 2006a). In addition,\nwe searched the International Astronomical Union Circulars (IAUCs)11 for announcements of broad-lined SN\nIc. We list the sample for which we obtained data in\nTable 2. Column (1) indicates the supernova, column\n(2) its host galaxy, columns (3) and (4) the Hubble type\n(in the RC3 system) and redshift of the host galaxy as\nlisted in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)\nor as determined by the SDSS pipeline for SDSS galaxies. Columns (5) and (6) list the offsets in RA and DEC\nof the SN from the host galaxy nucleus. The discovery\nIAUC and the circulars with the spectroscopic SN identification are listed in column (7). In column (8) we list\nthe fashion in which the broad-lined SN Ic were discovered: \"T\" stands for cases where the SN host galaxy\nwas targeted, while \"Non-T\" SN hosts were not. The\nlatter group consists of SN that were found in rolling,\nwide-field and non-targeted searches, or in backgroundgalaxies of fields with targeted galaxies. The discovery\nmethod is important for assessing the significance of selection effects in our sample. We discuss the implications\nand significance of column (8) in the following section in\nmore detail.\n2.3. Controlling for Selection Effects\nGRBs and SN are usually found in dramatically different ways. GRBs are discovered in wide-field, nearly allsky searches with Gamma-Ray satellites such as BATSE,\nHETE or Swift, whose afterglow studies have lead to the\ndiscovery of SN in certain GRBs.\nMost traditional searches for nearby SN, however, are\ngalaxy-targeted searches. The successful Lick Observatory SN Search (LOSS, Filippenko et al. 2001) and\nmany amateur SN searches possess a relatively small\nfield-of-view (FOV, 8.\u2032 7 \u00d7 8.\u2032 7 for LOSS) and have a\ndatabase of galaxies that they monitor nightly. Thus,\nthey include well-known and inevitably, more luminous galaxies (e.g., Li et al. 2001; Gallagher et al. 2005;\nMannucci et al. 2005). In particular, the LOSS database\nof 10341 galaxies with measured MB -values has a mean\n(median) value at the galaxy magnitude of MB = \u221219.9\n(MB = \u221220.1) mag with a standard deviation of 1.3 mag\n\n(J. Leaman, private communication). We are aware that\nselection effects can be introduced by different methods\nof discovery.This is why we have worked hard to include\nSN that were found in host galaxies that had not been\ntargeted for search. We believe they provide a better\nmatch to the host galaxies that are selected by the appearance of a GRB.\nThose 6 broad-lined SN were found either via the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) SN survey12 , or via the\nTexas SN Survey13 (Quimby 2006) that are both rolling\nsearches with a large FOV (1\u22123 square degrees) and thus\ncan be considered galaxy-impartial surveys. In other\ncases, they were found in background galaxies of LOSS\ntarget fields (W. Li, private communication), and thus,\ncan also be considered SN with non-targeted host galaxies. Assuming the sample of SDSS star-forming galaxies\nfrom Tremonti et al. (2004) is representative of the galaxies surveyed by the SDSS-II SN search, the mean (median) galaxy luminosity is MB \u223c \u221219.0 (MB \u223c \u221219.1)\nmag, i.e., one magnitude fainter than the mean value\nfor the LOSS sample. Moreover, the untargeted searches\nemploy image-subtraction techniques and thus are sensitive to SN occuring at the center of galaxies.\nFor completeness, we analyze and discuss spectra of\nall SN Ic (broad). But when directly comparing to the\nsample of SN Ic (broad & GRB), we only include SN Ic\n(broad) found in the same, non-targeted fashion in order\nto minimize discovery selection effects. The sample size\nof SN Ic (broad) that are free of galaxy-selection effects\nis comparable to that of SN-GRB.\n2.4. GRB Non-Detections\nHere we investigate whether the broad-lined SN Ic in\nTable 2 had a detected GRB.\nWang & Wheeler (1998) suggested that SN 1997ef\nand SN 1997dq were associated with GRB 971115 and\nGRB 971013, respectively. However, their spatial and,\nmore stringently, their temporal concurrences are much\nweaker than for GRB 980425/SN 1998bw (for detailed\ndiscussion see Li 2006 and Woosley & Bloom 2006).\nThus, claims of GRB associations for SN 1997ef and\nSN 1997dq are much less compelling than those for cases\nsuch as GRB 980425/SN 1998bw. Furthermore, no GRB\nwas found to be associated with SN 2002ap (Hurley et al.\n2002).\nMazzali et al. (2005) have argued for an off-axis GRB\nin SN 2003jd via late-time spectral signatures of an aspherical explosion seen from along the equatorial plane.\nOn the other hand, Soderberg et al. (2006c) present a\nsearch for late-time radio emission of a sample of 68 SN\nIb/c and argue against a GRB-connection for SN 2003jd,\nas well as for all non-SDSS SN of our sample (except\nSN 2005nb). We discuss if SN 2003jd had an off-axis\nGRB in more detail in \u00a7 5.2, along with the broader\nquestion of viewing angle effects.\nFor the rest of the broad-lined SN Ic in our sample, we\nconsulted the GRB localizations14 and did not find any\nsignificant spatial (within \u00b1 2 deg) nor temporal (within\n\u00b1 20 days) concurrences. Thus, we assume that no GRBs\nwere observed for those broad-lined SN Ic.\n12\n13\n\n11\n\nhttp://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/cbat.html\n\n14\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/supernova/aboutsprnova.html\nhttp://grad40.as.utexas.edu/ quimby/tss/index.html\nSee http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ jcg/grbgen.html\n\n\f4\n3.

Telluric lines were removed\nfollowing a procedure similar to that of Wade & Horne\n(1988) and Matheson et al. (2000). The final flux calibrations were derived from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars.\nIn Table 3 we list the details of our spectroscopic\nobservations. Exposures over multiple nights were averaged for SN 1997ef and SN 2003jd to increase the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In four cases (UGC 4107,\nNGC 7080, MCG-01-59-21, UGC7230, i.e. hosts of SN\n1997ef, 1998ey, 2003jd and SN 2005nb respectively), a\nspline fit to the continuum was subtracted, in order to\neliminate the supernova contribution. This procedure\nis adequate to study the emission line component of\nthe host galaxy at the position of the SN. Since the\nSN features are very broad (\u223c 10,000\u221230,000 km s\u22121 )\ncompared to the nebular galaxy emission lines (200\u2212400\nkm s\u22121 ), there are no significant errors (. 5 %) in the\nemission line measurements due to interpolation errors.\nFigure 1 shows the emission-line spectra of four host\ngalaxies at the position of the SN, with the SN spectrum subtracted. In Figure 2, we present central spectra\nobtained with Clay+LDSS3 and FLWO1.5m+FAST.\n\nMCG\u221201\u221259\u221221 ( SN2003jd )\n\n0.5\n0.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\nUGC07230 ( SN2005nb )\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\nFig. 1.- Host-galaxy spectra of four local broad-lined SN Ic\nat the SN position, with the SN spectrum subtracted.

CfA Data\nEight of the total of 17 host-galaxy spectra were obtained with the 6.5 m Clay Telescope of the Magellan Observatory located at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO),\nwith the 6.5 m Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) and the\n1.5 m Tillinghast telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO). The spectrographs utilized\nwere the LDSS-3 (Mulchaey & Gladders 2005) at LCO,\nthe Blue Channel (Schmidt et al. 1989) at the MMT, and\nFAST (Fabricant et al. 1998) at the FLWO 1.5m telescope.

Small-scale adjustments derived from night-sky lines in the observed frames were\nalso applied. The spectra were always taken at or near\nthe parallactic angle (Filippenko 1982) and at low airmass.

The\nspectra were acquired with the SDSS 2.5m telescope\nusing fiber-fed spectographs, with the fiber subtending\na diameter of 3\u2032\u2032 (for a full discussion of aperture effects see Tremonti et al. 2004). Exposure times had\nbeen chosen to lead to a signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) of\nat least 4 at g=20.2 mag and range from 2160 \u22125500\nsec.

Frieman, private communication). Nevertheless, this normalization\nconvention does not change our metallicity determinations as they\nare based on line flux ratios.\n\n3.3. Emission Line Measurements\nThe focus of this paper is the analysis of the nebular\nemission lines of broad-lined SN Ic host galaxies. However, for spectra of galaxy nuclei, the presence of stellar\nabsorption features may contaminate the emission components, especially the Balmer lines (e.g., Tremonti et al.\n2004; Moustakas & Kennicutt 2006a). This is not a concern for spectra of HII regions near or at the position\nof the SN, as there the light-weighted emission is contributed foremost by hotter stars with weak Balmer lines.\nIn our sample of 9 central spectra, we encountered seven\ncentral spectra with significant stellar features. To remove the starlight we utilize the method of stellar template subtraction (see Ho 2004 for a full discussion of\nthe different techniques); in particular, we employ the\nstandard principal component analysis (PCA) technique\ndeveloped by Hao et al. (2005) for use on SDSS data\n(see also Greene & Ho 2004). Using an approach pioneered by Bromley et al. (1998) for the Las Campanas\nRedshift Survey (see also Connolly et al. 1995), we employ the methods of Hao et al. (2005) to use a library of\nSDSS spectra for absorption-line galaxies that is transformed into an orthogonal basis of \"eigenspectra\" spanning the variance in the sample. We model the absorption and continuum part of the input galaxy spectrum\nas a linear combination of eight eigenspectra plus an additional A-star component. The PCA method is especially powerful since it does not assume single-metallicity\npopulations, uses the homogeneous survey-data of SDSS\nas templates, need not include the galaxy velocity dispersion and spans a large range in galaxy properties\nwith a very small number of components. In Figure 3\nwe plot the affected original spectra (top) and spectra\nafter subtracting the modeled stellar continuum (bottom) : the SDSS spectra of NGC 3810, UGC 4107,\nSDSS J213756.52-000157.7, SDSS J222532.38+000914.9,\n17\n\nSee http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/6dFGS/\n\n\f6\nand SDSS J115913.13-013616.0, i.e., the host galaxies of\nsupernovae 1997dq, 1997ef, 2005ks, 2006qk, and 2007I\nrespectively. Thus, we arrive at emission-line spectra.\nFor M 74, UGC11301, and SDSS J211520.09-002300.3,\nthe host galaxies of SN 2002ap, 2005da and 2005fk, respectively, we are unable to recover any emission lines in\ntheir central regions, due to the low surface-brightness\nor absence of H II regions. Since M 74 is a nearby, wellobserved star-forming spiral galaxy, we consult the literature for the emission-line fluxes of its H II regions as a\nfunction of radius (see \u00a7 5.1). For the hosts of SN 2005da\nand 2005fk, we are not able to measure emission-linebased metallicities and refrain from using Lick indices, as\nsystematic offsets plague different metallicity methods.\nThe low surface-brightness or absence of H II regions implies little instantenous (i.e., in the last \u223c 3 million years)\nstar formation for these galaxies.\nAfter properly correcting all spectra for their recession velocities (as listed in Table 2), we measure optical emission line properties by fitting Gaussians to the\nindividual spectral lines via the splot routine in IRAF.\nThe emission-line fluxes and their statistical errors are\ngiven in Tables 4 and 5. For the derivation of the statistical errors, we follow P\u00e9rez-Montero & D\u0131\u0301az (2003)\nand use spectra before continuum-subtraction to measure\ntheir noise properties. The total errors are computed by\nadding the statistical errors and the 5% flux calibration\nerror in quadrature.\nIn the subsequent analysis, we correct the line fluxes for\nGalactic reddening, according to Schlegel et al. (1998),\nand for intrinsic reddening by using the observed Balmer\ndecrement, if H\u03b2 emission line is detected. We assume case B recombination and thus, the standard\nvalue of 2.86 as the intrinsic H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio (Osterbrock\n1989), and apply the standard Galactic reddening law\nwith RV = 3.1 (Cardelli et al. 1989). Tables 6 and\n7 list in column (9) the color excess due to the SN\nhost galaxy E(B \u2212 V )Host derived from the observed\nBalmer decrement, a robust indicator of the amount\nof dust (e.g., Calzetti et al. 1994; Kewley et al. 2002;\nMoustakas & Kennicutt 2006b).\n4. DERIVED HOST-GALAXY PROPERTIES\n\n4.1. Galaxy Luminosities\nWe drew the host-galaxy luminosities from the LyonMeudon Extragalactic Database (HyperLEDA)18 as\ntheir sample has been homogeneously compiled. We\nadopted as galaxy luminosities the values listed as mabs\nin HyperLEDA, i.e. the absolute B-band magnitude,\nMB , corrected for Galactic and internal extinction and\nk-corrections.\nWe applied a similar procedure to derive absolute\nmagnitudes for the hosts of Sloan SN that were not\nlisted in HyperLEDA. We retrieved the host-galaxy Petrosian magnitudes from SDSS DR519 and corrected for\nGalactic extinction using the tabulated reddening values\nand a standard Galactic reddening law with RV = 3.1\n(Cardelli et al. 1989). We applied k-corrections calculated via kcorrect (v.3.220 ), which was developed by\n18\n19\n20\n\nSee http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/\nSee http://cas.sdss.org/dr5/en/tools/explore/.\nSee http://cosmo.nyu.edu/blanton/kcorrect/\n\nBlanton et al. (2003) for use with the SDSS filter set,\nin order to obtain the absolute B-band magnitude MB .\nThe full list is given in column (2) of Tables 6 and 7.\n4.2. Metallicities and Star Formation Rates\nThe nebular oxygen abundance is the canonical choice\nof metallicity indicator for ISM studies, since oxygen is the most abundant metal in the gas phase,\nonly weakly depleted, and exhibits very strong nebular lines in the optical wavelength range (Tremonti et al.\n2004; Kobulnicky & Kewley 2004).\nThus, wellestablished diagnostic techniques have been developed\n(e.g., Osterbrock 1989; Pagel et al. 1979). We compute host gas-phase oxygen abundance for both SN\nIc (broad) and of SN Ic (broad & GRB) using three\ndifferent and independent metallicity diagnostics. Using three independent calibrations that utilize different\nsets of lines for computing the oxygen abundance, we\ncan check if any of our results depend on the choice\nof diagnostic. Furthermore, since different metallicity\ncalibrations can have large systematic offsets between\neach other (Ellison et al. 2005; Ellison & Kewley 2005;\nKewley et al. 2007), we compute abundances for host\ngalaxies of both SN Ic (broad) and SN Ic (broad &\nGRB) in the same scale and compare their relative\nvalues. The three well-known diagnostics used here\nare: 1) the iterative strong-line diagnostics calibrated\nby Kewley & Dopita (2002) (henceforth KD02) and updated by Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004), 2) the calibration\nby McGaugh (1991) (henceforth M91) and 3) the diagnostic of Pettini & Pagel (2004) in the direct electron\ntemperature (Te ) scale. Details about each calibration\ntechnique will be given below. For the SN Ic (broad), we\nfurthermore list central abundances in Table 6 and those\nat the SN position separately (Table 7) as spiral galaxies\npossess observed radial metallicity gradients, from metalrich centers to metal-poor outskirts (e.g., van Zee et al.\n1998; Bell & de Jong 2000; Kewley et al. 2005). For the\nSN observed with GRB, we consulted the literature for\nthe emission line fluxes at the GRB-SN sites (Table 1)\nand list the abundances computed with the same three\ndiagnostics in Table 8.\nKD02 use a host of stellar population synthesis and\nphotoionization models to derive their metallicity diagnostics. Oxygen abundances derived iteratively in this\nmanner are listed in column (3) of Tables 6, 7, and 8,\ncorrected for extinction [column (9)]. For the metallicity range of log (O/H)+12\u22658.5, the KD02 method\nmainly uses the [N II] \u03bb6584/[O II] \u03bb3727 ratio, while\nfor the low-metallicity regime, the R23 diagnostic, defined as R23 = ([O II] \u03bb3727+ [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007)/H\u03b2,\nis usually employed. If neither H\u03b2 nor [O II] \u03bb3727 are\nobserved, we adopt the [N II] \u03bb6584/H\u03b1 method from\nKobulnicky & Kewley (2004) with the KD02 calibration,\nassume a normal ionization parameter (q = 2 \u00d7 107 ) and\nnote those cases in the tables.\nAs alternatives, we also provide metallicity determinations using the well-known strong-line calibration of\nMcGaugh (1991) (henceforth M91) in column (4) and\nPettini & Pagel (2004) (henceforth PP04) in column (5).\nM91 provides a theoretical calibration of the R23 parameter via photoionization models that produce oxygen abundances that are comparable in accuracy to direct methods that rely on the measurement of nebular\n\n\f7\ntemperature. The PP04 calibration, on the other hand,\nis predominantly based on an empirical fit to the electron temperature (Te )-abundances (using the lines of\n[O III] \u03bb4363 and [O II] \u03bb3727) of H II regions. This\nmethod is often referred to as the \"direct\" abundance\nmethod, as accurate abundance measurements can be\nobtained directly from line ratios of auroral to nebular\nline intensities, such as [O III] \u03bb4363/\u03bb5007 that indicate the electron temperature. However, the Te method\nsaturates at higher metallicities (log (O/H)+12 \u22658.4),\nprobably due to the additional cooling of [O III] lines in\nthe IR which is not accounted for in current Te prescription, and hence PPO4 include six R23 -derived metallicities to extrapolate to higher metallicities. The PPO4\nscale is typically \u223c 0.2 dex lower than the theoretical\nstrong line methods such as KD02. The exact cause of\nthis discrepancy is highly debated (for a discussion see\ne.g., Garnett et al. 2004a,b; Stasi\u0144ska 2005), and it might\nbe due to temperature variations that are not considered properly in the Te prescription (Bresolin 2006). For\nthe host galaxies of SN Ic (broad), we used the recommended [O III]/[N II]-based prescription of PP04 (henceforth called PP04-O3N2). For the host galaxies of SN Ic\n(broad & GRB), we list in Table 8 their oxygen abundances in the Te scale, either via direct measurements\nof [O III] \u03bb4363 or by converting KD02 abundances into\nTe -based ones. Since the PP04 calibration is tied to the\nTe -abundances, the inter comparison should be valid. We\nnote that the GRB-SN abundances in the scales of KD02\nand Te were already computed in Kewley et al. (2007).\nWe furthermore use the direct Te -based abundance for\nthe host of GRB/XRF 060218/SN 2006aj as derived from\nthe recent detection of [O III] \u03bb4363 (Wiersema et al.\n2007), which is the same as the Te -converted KD02 abundance from Kewley et al. (2007).\nWe compute the uncertainties in the measured metallicities by explicitly including the statistical uncertainties\nof the line flux measurements and those in the derived\nSN host galaxy reddening, and by properly propagating\nthem into the metallicity determination. Details are discussed in \u00a7 4.3.\nFor M 74, the host of SN 2002ap, we took the measured\nemission line fluxes of individual HII regions in M 74 and\ntheir deprojected galactocentric radii from McCall et al.\n(1985); Ferguson et al. (1998); van Zee et al. (1998);\nBresolin et al. (1999) and Castellanos et al. (2002). Having computed the oxygen abundances in the three metallicity scales, we fit for the observed M 74 abundance gradient and obtain radial gradients of \u22120.49\u00b10.04 dex/\u03c125 ,\n\u22120.49\u00b10.05 dex/\u03c125 , and \u22120.45\u00b10.05 dex/\u03c125 ,in the\nscales of the KD02, M91 and PP04(O3N2), respectively,\nwhere \u03c125 stands for the isophotal radius. With an extrapolated central metallicity as listed in Table 6 and the\nappropriate gradient, we compute the metallicity at the\nradial de-projected distance of SN 2002ap (4\u2032 38\u2032\u2032 ), and\nlist them in Table 7. We note that the oxygen abundance at the SN position is similar to the value quoted\nin Smartt et al. (2002) and Crockett et al. (2007) in the\nappropriate scales. The uncertainty in the value of \u03c125\nfor M 74 introduces the (small) uncertainty of 0.02 dex\nin the oxygen abundance value, which we include in the\nuncertainty budget.\nFor NGC 3810 and MCG-05-10-15, the hosts of\nSN 1997dq and 2003bg, we do not possess spectra taken\n\nat the SN positions, which are 52\u2032\u2032 and 30\u2032\u2032 , respectively,\nfrom the galaxy centers. At the distance of SN 1997dq\n(\u223c 18 Mpc, from HyperLEDA) and of SN 2003bg (\u223c\n16 Mpc, from HyperLEDA), the SN de-projected galactocentric distances amount to \u223c 4.5 kpc and 2.4 kpc,\nrespectively. Assuming usual metallicity gradients of\n\u223c \u22120.05 dex kpc\u22121 for MB = \u221220 mag spirals and\nof \u223c \u22120.1 dex kpc\u22121 for MB = \u221217.5 mag galaxies\n(Garnett et al. 1997; Henry & Worthey 1999), i.e., similar to the host galaxies, we adopt SN metallicity values\nthat are 0.2 dex lower than that of the nucleus for both\ngalaxies (see Table 7). In order to account for the uncertainty in the extrapolated abundances at the SN site, we\nadded in quadrature the spread in metallicity gradients\n(choosing a conservative value of 0.1 dex) observed for\ngalaxies of corresponding luminosity to the uncertainty\nin the central abundance.\nWe note that we were not able to compute reliable\nmetallicities and star formation rates for the host galaxy\nof SN 2005kz. Its spectrum is dominated by the AGN\nand its line ratios of [N II]/H\u03b1, [O III]/H\u03b2, [O I]/H\u03b1 are\ncharacteristic of a composite starburst/Seyfert2 object\n(Kewley et al. 2006). Thus, we only list SN 2005kz's\nhost galaxy MB in Table 6, along with the MB of hosts\nof SN 2005da and 2005fk.\nUsing the H\u03b1 emission line strengths listed in Tables 4\nand 5, we derive extinction-corrected local H\u03b1 luminosities and extinction-corrected local star formation rates\n(SFRs) (Kennicutt 1998), and list them in columns (6)\nand (7) of Tables 6, 7 and 8. We note that these values are lower limits to the global SFR since the galaxies\nhave larger angular diameters than the slit sizes used,\nexcept for SDSS J030829.66-005320.1, the host galaxy\nof SN 2005kr. When available, we use the line ratio of\nS II \u03bb6717 and S II \u03bb6731 combined with the Mappings\nphotoionization code (Sutherland & Dopita 1993) and a\n5-level model to compute electron densities in the S+\nzone (column 8).\n4.3. Uncertainties in Metallicity Measurements\nWe explicitly include the effect of the statistical errors\nin the line measurements on the metallicity determinations. For each metallicity diagnostic, we compute the\nminimum and maximum oxygen abundance value for the\ngiven statistical uncertainties in the line measurements\nand assign them as bounds for the most positive and\nnegative errors. These are listed in Tables 6 and 7, directly following the reported abundance value as determined from the measured line values. In the computation, we also include the effect of the statistical error in\nthe H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio that influences the measured Balmer\ndecrement and therefore the derived reddening. Because\nof logarithmic dependence of the metallicity diagnostics\non line ratios, the computed abundance uncertainties are\nsometimes not symmetric around the reported values.\nFurthermore, we checked whether a change in the Case\nB recombination value from 2.85 to e.g., 3.1 (typical of\nAGN) makes a difference in the derived metallicities from\n[N II]/[O II], and the effect is minor (< 0.03 dex).\nIn the optical, the choice of extinction curve makes\nnegligible difference to the extinction correction of optical line ratios (see e.g., the review by Calzetti 2001).\nWe have tested this ourselves by applying three different extinction curves to [N II]/[O II]: the Whitford\n\n\f8\nReddening curve, as parameterized by Miller & Mathews\n(1972), the parameterization by Cardelli et al. (1989),\nand that by Osterbrock (1989). We find that metallicities derived from [NII]/[OII] using different optical\nextinction curves are identical. The same conclusion\nwas obtained by Moustakas & Kennicutt (2006a) and\nMoustakas & Kennicutt (2006b), who explored the effect of different extinction curve on oxygen abundance\ndeterminations of a sample of 417 nearby galaxies with\na diverse range of galaxy types and histories.\nFor the SN-GRB sample, the line flux errors are not\navailable for the majority of GRB host spectra in the\nliterature and we therefore assign a uniform conservative\nerror of 0.1 dex.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nWe find that the host galaxies of broad-lined SN Ic\nhave the following properties: they are mid- to latetype spirals (consistent with the host-galaxy morphological classifications found for the host galaxies of SN\nIb and SN Ic in van den Bergh et al. 2005 and references therein), their B-band luminosities range between\n\u221217 < MB < \u221222 mag, and their central oxygen abundances span 8.63 <12+log(O/H)KD02 <9.15. Along with\ntheir SFRs and electron densities, they appear to conform to the general population of normal local star forming galaxies (for comparison with SDSS star forming\ngalaxies, see 5.1 and Figure 5).\n5.1. Comparison with SN-GRB Sample\nIt is the main goal of this study to compare the physical\ncharacteristics of host galaxies of SN Ic (broad) that had\nno observed GRBs to those of SN-GRB hosts.\nFirst, we find that the SFR values are similar between the two samples, with SFR(H\u03b1)\u223c 0.1\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nOne exception appears to be MCG-05-10-15, the host\nof SN 2003bg, which has a value of 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , not\ncorrected for extinction. However, most of our local\nSFR values of SN Ic (broad) are lower limits to the\nglobal values, and thus they are probably larger than\nthose of the GRB-SN host sample. Furthermore, considering the much smaller masses for the GRB hosts\nas indicated by their lower luminosities, the specif ic\nSFR (SFR normalized to galaxy mass) of GRB hosts are\nlarger than those of SN Ic hosts, and of SDSS galaxies in\ngeneral (Christensen et al. 2004; Gorosabel et al. 2005;\nSollerman et al. 2005; Savaglio et al. 2006; Thoene et al.\n2006). A comparison between the electron densities does\nnot yield any statistical significant results, as only one\nSN-GRB host has a measured electron density. All measured electron densities lie within the range of observed\nvalues for galaxies and HII regions.\nNext, Figure 5 shows the main result of our comparison: we plot host galaxy metallicity (as expressed\nin terms of oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) with the\nKD02 calibration) and host galaxy luminosity (MB ) of\nbroad-lined SN Ic without observed GRBs (called \"SN Ic\n(broad)\", circles) and with GRBs (called \"SN Ic (broad\n& GRB)\", squares). Objects whose host galaxies had\nnot been targeted during the discovery have an extra\ncircle (for SN without GRBs) or an extra square (for SN\nwith GRBs) around their plotted symbol. We note that\nthree of the five broad-lined SN Ic found in the lower\n\nluminosity galaxies (MB > \u221219 mag) were discovered\nby the SDSS-II SN Survey, which is a galaxy-impartial\nsurvey. For the broad-lined SN Ic we only plot abundances measured at or extrapolated to the SN position.\nThese plotted values are lower than the values we measure for the center of the same host galaxies (see Table 6) presumably due to metallicity gradients as discussed in \u00a7 . The SN-GRB host abundances also reflect the metallicity at the SN-GRB position, since they\nwere either measured specifically at the SN position (for\nGRB 980425/SN 1998bw), or the SN reside in the nucleus\nof their dwarf-galaxy hosts that are chemically homogeneous (Kobulnicky & Skillman 1997). Due to the short\nlife times of the massive SN progenitor stars (t . 10\nMillion years for MZAMS & 20 M\u2299 , e.g., Woosley et al.\n2002), we regard the metallicities at the SN position as\nnatal metallicities.\nFor reference, we also plot the luminosities of local (0.005< z <0.2) SDSS star forming galaxies from\nTremonti et al. (2004). The plotted central oxygen abundances were re-calculated in the KD02 scale, using the\npublished emission line fluxes, to be internally consistent. We used the DR2 values with a SNR-cut of 5\nfor the emission line fluxes. Their loci on Figure 5 illustrate the well-studied luminosity-metallicity (L \u2212 Z)\nrelationship for disk galaxies (e.g., Rubin et al. 1984;\nGarnett 2002; Tremonti et al. 2004), which has been also\nobserved for dwarf irregular galaxies (Searle & Sargent\n1972; Lequeux et al. 1979; Skillman et al. 1989; Pilyugin\n2001; Garnett 2002) and for blue compact galaxies\n(Campos-Aguilar et al. 1993; Shi et al. 2005). We note\nthat the SDSS metallicities were derived using fibers with\n3\u2032\u2032 in diameter, corresponding to a mean projected fiber\nsize of \u223c4.6 kpc for that sample (Tremonti et al. 2004),\nand that they therefore generally reflect central metallicities (see also Kewley et al. 2005). Hence, a detailed comparison between the distribution of abundances at the SN\nsites and those of SDSS galaxies is not warranted, and\nthe SDSS loci should be regarded as indicating a general\ntrend.\nThere is a bimodal distribution of host-galaxy luminosities and metallicities: the luminosities of the hosts for\nthe SN-GRB are generally low, while the SN Ic (broad)\nhosts extend to high galaxy luminosities. What is more,\nthe SN-GRB have low metallicity environments while SN\nIc (broad) are found in systematically higher metallicity environments. We plot as a dotted line the value\nof 12+log(O/H)KD02 \u223c8.5 that appears to be the dividing line for the oxygen abundance between SN with and\nwithout observed GRBs. While this GRB host-galaxy\npreference compared to other galaxies has been noted before (e.g., Prochaska et al. 2004; Gorosabel et al. 2005;\nSollerman et al. 2005; Modjaz et al. 2006; Stanek et al.\n2006; Kewley et al. 2007), we emphasize that we are comparing now the host galaxies of SN with the same spectral characteristics. Thus, our comparison includes any\nconditions required to produce envelope-stripped corecollapse SN and we can test whether low metal abundance is a sufficient condition for the evolution of the\nmassive progenitor through the stages that lead to a\nGRB jet. Using the host metallicities with the KD02\ncalibration of SN Ic (broad & GRB) and of SN Ic\n(broad) found in non-targeted fashion, we conduct a simple Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test. We find that the\n\n\f9\n\nFig. 5.- Host galaxy luminosity (MB ) and host galaxy metallicity (in terms of oxygen abundance) at the sites of nearby broad-lined\nSN Ic (\"SN Ic (broad)\": blue filled circles) and broad-lined SN Ic connected with GRBs (\"SN (broad & GRB)\": red filled squares; see also\nStanek et al. 2006; Kewley et al. 2007). Extra circles and squares designate SN which were found in a non-targeted fashion. The oxygen\nabundances are in the Kewley & Dopita (2002) (KD02) scale and represent the abundance at the SN position. Due to radial metallicity\ngradients, the gas abundance at the SN position is lower than the central galaxy abundance for some SN (compare Tables 6 and 7). Labels\nrepresent the SN names while one (\"020903\") refers to its associated GRB. Yellow points are values for local star-forming galaxies in SDSS\n(Tremonti et al. 2004), re-calculated in the Kewley & Dopita (2002) scale for consistency, and illustrate the empirical luminosity-metallicity\n(L \u2212 Z) relationship for galaxies. Host environments of GRBs are systematically less metal-rich than host environments of broad-lined SN\nIc where no GRB was observed. The dotted line at 12+log(O/H)KD02 \u223c8.5 designates the apparent dividing line between SN with and\nwithout observed GRBs.\n\nprobability that both sets of host metallicities have been\ndrawn from the same parent population is low, namely\n\u223c 3%.\nMoreover, we plot in Figure 6 the comparison between\nthe two host samples and the local SDSS galaxies in the\nmetallicity scales of M91 and of PP04-O3N2, with the\nlatter being effectively in the Te scale. While the absolute values of the abundances are different in different scales, as expected, the bimodal distribution persists\n\nin each scale and thus, is independent of the choice of\nmetallicity diagnostic. The K-S Test applied to the host\nabundances of SN Ic (broad & GRB) and SN Ic (broad)\nfound in a non-targeted fashion yields low probabilities\nof 4% (M91-based abundances) and 3% (Te -based abundances) that they are drawn from the same population.\nFor each scale, we plot as a dotted line the boundary\nthat separates the two samples: 12+log(O/H)M91 \u223c8.4\nand 12+log(O/H)Te \u223c8.1. Although our sample is small\n\n\f10\nour findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low\nmetal abundance is the cause of some very massive stars\nbecoming SN-GRB.\nOf course, a question of interest for GRB-modelers\nis how these cut-off values in oxygen abundance compare to solar metallicity. The answer is not clear due\nto the problems that plague absolute metallicity determination: it depends on which of the three metallicity scales is adopted and whether one uses the high\nvalue for solar oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)=8.9,\nDelahaye & Pinsonneault 2006) or the lower, revised\nsolar abundance (12 + log(O/H)=8.7, Asplund et al.\n2005). Thus, the cut-off value can range between 0.2\n\u22120.6 Z\u2299 . Nevertheless, our main conclusions do not depend on the absolute metallicity scale.\nWe note that Tremonti et al. (2004) computed the\nmetallicity of the host galaxy of SN 2007I with their diagnostics, using the same SDSS emission line spectrum\nwe used. Their value, 12+log(O/H)Tremonti04 = 8.3, is\n0.4 dex lower than 12+log(O/H)KD02 = 8.71 \u00b1 0.04,\nbut similar to 12+log(O/H)PP0403N2 = 8.39+0.4\n\u22120.17 . We\nattribute this difference to the absence of [O II] in the\ngalaxy spectrum which precludes the usage of the reliable\nKD02 methods (using [NII]/[OII] or R23 ), and instead\nnecessitates using [NII]/H\u03b1. Thus, the reliable metallicity for this galaxy is in the PP04 scale. Nevertheless, this\ncaveat does not change our conclusions as the GRB-SN\nmetallicities are even lower than 12+log(O/H)PP0403N2\n= 8.4.\nAt face value, our results differ from various studies in\nthe literature, which have concluded that high-z GRB\nhosts are not necessarily low-metallicity systems. However, there might be intrinsic differences in GRB population at low and high z \u2212 as mentioned, the low-z GRBs\nmight constitute a different class of low-luminosity GRBs\nthat are not detected at higher z (Cobb et al. 2006;\nLiang et al. 2006; Guetta & Della Valle 2006). Moreover, most of the techniques for measuring abundances\nat higher z are different from our direct approach:\nthey either use absorption techniques in GRB afterglows\n(Prochaska et al. 2007 and references therein) or infer\nthe metallicity using galaxy luminosity and color via\nthe L \u2212 Z relation (Berger et al. 2006). Attempts to\ndirectly measure GRB host metallicities at higher redshifts via emission line diagnostics remain inconclusive\n(Savaglio et al. 2006, S. Savaglio in prep.).\nRecently, Wolf & Podsiadlowski (2007) suggested that\nif there were a sharp cut-off for the metallicity dependence of cosmological GRBs, assuming that the GRBhosts follow the standard L \u2212 Z relationship at z \u223c 0.7,\nit would lie at around 12 + log(O/H)lim \u223c 8.7 \u00b1 0.3 in\nthe scale of Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004). They claimed\nto rule out GRB models that require sharp metallicity\ncut-offs well below one-half the solar abundance (assuming the value of 8.7 as the solar oxygen abundance), since\nthose models would predict GRB hosts that need to be\nmuch less luminous than the observed hosts in the sample of Fruchter et al. (2006). Interestingly, even though\ntheir assumptions rely on the conforming behavior of\nGRB hosts, and they investigate cosmological GRBs,\ntheir findings are consistent with our results. Ongoing\nattempts to directly measure host galaxy metallicities\nof cosmological GRBs (e.g., Savaglio et al. (2006)) are\n\nexpected to clarify this debate, though long integration\ntimes and NIR spectra will be required for the bulk of\nthe cosmological GRBs due to their high redshift (with\na mean z \u223c 3 for the Swift GRBs).\n5.2. Viewing Angle Effects and Caveats\nCosmological GRB are highly collimated events, with\nbeaming angles \u03b8 \u223c 4 \u2212 10 deg (Frail et al. 2001;\nGuetta et al. 2005), while the low-luminosity, nearby\nGRB appear to be less beamed (Guetta & Della Valle\n2006). Thus, one might argue that the lack of observed\ngamma-ray emission for the SN Ic (broad) presented in\nthis study is due to viewing angle effects, i.e. the GRB\noccurred but our line-of-sight was not aligned with the\njet axis.\nWe have good reason to believe that this is probably\nnot the case for at least six of the twelve of the objects in\nour sample. Soderberg et al. (2006c) searched for radio\nemission in 68 local SN Ib and SN Ic at late times (after 0.5\u221220 years), when the GRB, if present, is expected\nto become isotropic and emit in the radio regime. They\ndid not detect late-time radio emission and therefore exclude an off-axis jet-driven SN engine in the following\nSN of our sample: SN 1997dq, SN 1997ef, SN 1998ey,\nSN 2002ap, SN 2003jd, and in addition, SN 2005da\n(Soderberg & Kulkarni 2005) and SN 2005kz (Soderberg\n2005). We note that the conclusions of Soderberg et al.\n(2006c) rely on modeling GRB radio properties based\non those observed for GRB 980425/SN 1998bw. Including GRB/XRF 060218/SN 2006aj, Soderberg et al.\n(2006b) infer that less than one in three broadlined SN may have a radio luminosity comparable\nto GRB/XRF 060218/SN 2006aj. For SN 2003bg,\nstrong early-time X-ray and radio emission was detected\n(Soderberg et al. 2003; Pooley & Lewin 2003) and interpreted as signs of interactions between SN ejecta and\ndense CSM (Soderberg et al. 2006a).\nThere was no such radio search for emission in the SN\nfound by the Sloan-II SN survey from our sample. Thus,\nthe viewing angle issue remains a caveat for these SN.\nAs noted above, Mazzali et al. (2005) argue for an offaxis jet in SN 2003jd, since they interpret double-peaked\noxygen and magnesium profiles observed in its late-time\nspectra as signs of an aspherical, axisymmetric explosion\ncaused by a jet. However, asphericities have been observed in other core-collapse SN (e.g, Leibundgut et al.\n1991), most notably in SN 1987A (e.g., Wang et al.\n2002), and might not necessarily signal the presence of a\nrelativistic jet of material. Polarization studies suggest\nclear asphericity in ejecta of all types of core-collapse\nSN, which increases with decreasing envelope mass (see\nLeonard & Filippenko 2005 for a review). These results\nindicate that asphericity might be an ubiquitous feature\nof the conventional neutrino-driven process of core collapse, occasionally damped by the additional envelopes\nof hydrogen and helium. In order to fully observationally probe the range of geometries realized during the explosion of massive stars, a systematic study of late-time\nspectral features for a large sample of stripped-envelope\ncore-collapse supernovae (i.e., SN Ib, Ic, IIb) is necessary. Such a study is presently underway and includes\na SN Ib, SN 2004ao that displays a double-peaked profile of oxygen with the same width and characteristics as\nseen in SN 2003jd (Modjaz 2007).\n\n\f11\n\nFig. 6.- Similar to Figure 5, but using different metallicity diagnostics; Kewley & Dopita (2002) (KD02) as in Figure 5 (left); McGaugh\n(1991) (M91, middle); and Pettini & Pagel (2004) (PP04-O3N2), which is effectively on the Te scale, (right). As before, host galaxy\nluminosity (MB ) and host galaxy metallicity (in terms of oxygen abundance) at the SN site are plotted for nearby broad-lined SN Ic (\"SN\nIc (broad)\"; blue filled circles) and for broad-lined SN Ic connected with GRBs (\"SN (broad & GRB)\"; red filled squares). Extra circles\nand squares designate SN which were found in a non-targeted fashion. Host environments of GRBs are more metal-poor than environments\nof broad-lined SN Ic where no GRB was observed, independent of the abundance scale used. Yellow dots designate the SDSS galaxy values\ncalculated in the respect metallicity scales.\n\nFurthermore, Li (2006) describes tentative evidence\nfor a relationship between Epk , the peak of the gammaray spectrum of four GRBs with associated SN, and the\npeak luminosity (MSN ) of their associated SN, such that\nGRBs with harder gamma-ray spectra have associated\nSN that are more luminous. Furthermore, he suggests\nthat the Epk of the putative GRBs if they occurred in association with supernovae 2002ap and 1997ef would have\nbeen located in the UV regime due to the low SN luminosities and that those GRBs would have had very low\ngamma-ray energies (Li 2006). If true, those explosions\nwould hardly qualify as bona fide \"gamma-ray\" bursts.\nIn any case, caution should be exercised when extending\na relationship based on four objects to a range outside\nthat probed by the data, and future nearby GRB-SN\nought to be used to verify the Epk -MSN correlation of Li\n(2006).\nThus, we conclude that observations do not support associated off-axis GRBs with six broad-lined SN Ic, while\nwe cannot exclude the possibility of off-axis GRBs in the\n\nSDSS-SN of our sample.\n6. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY\nIn this paper we presented spectroscopic data of a statistically significant set of host galaxies of 12 nearby\n(z <0.14) broad-lined SN Ic with no observed GRBs.\nUsing the galaxy emission-line measurements corrected\nfor stellar absorption and extinction, we derived central oxygen abundances and abundances at the SN\nposition based on strong-line diagnostics that span\n8.5 <12+log(O/H)KD02 <9.1 on the Kewley & Dopita\n(2002) scale, 8.5 <12+log(O/H)M91 <8.9 on the\nMcGaugh (1991) scale, and 8.2 <12+log(O/H)P P 04 <8.9\non the Pettini & Pagel (2004) scale, which effectively\nuses the Te scale. Furthermore, we computed local star\nformation rates for central regions, as well as for regions\nat the position of the SN, and drew from the literature\nthe host galaxy B-band luminosities, which range between \u221217 < MB < \u221222 mag. This study, which constructed local chemical abundances for the locations of\n\n\f12\nindividual supernovae of type Ic (broad), is the first of\nits kind. To our knowledge, a broader application of this\napproach to other core-collapse supernovae has not been\ncarried out.\nWe compared the properties of our host sample with\nthe properties of five nearby SN-GRB hosts, for which\nwe derived chemical abundances using the same three\nmetallicity diagnostics as for SN without observed GRBs.\nBroad-lined SN Ic without GRBs tend to consistently\ninhabit more metal-rich environments, and their host\ngalaxies, for the same luminosity range (\u221217 < MB <\n\u221221 mag), are systematically more metal-rich than corresponding GRB host galaxies. The trend is independent of the choice of diagnostic and cannot be due to\nselection effects as we include six SN found in a similar non-targeted manner as GRB-SN. The boundary between broad-lined SN Ic that have a GRB accompanying\nthem and broad-lined SN Ic without a GRB lies at an\noxygen abundance of \u223c 12+log(O/H)KD02 \u223c 8.5, which\ncorresponds to 0.2\u22120.6 Z\u2299 depending on the adopted\nmetallicity scale and solar abundance value. This correlation is consistent with the argument that (local) longduration GRBs require low-metallicity environments for\njet production. If this correlation holds up as the samples\ngrow, it would be consistent with the idea that low metal\nabundance is a significant factor that allows a very massive star to become both a broad-lined SN Ic and a GRB\nwhen it collapses. On the other hand, if broad-lined SN\nIc without an accompanying GRB are found in galaxies\nwith low metal abundance, then a more complicated set\nof conditions than simply metal abundance will need to\nbe considered.\nSince 3/5 of the broad-lined SN Ic harbored in\nlow-luminosity galaxies were found by the SDSSII SN Survey, we note the importance of rolling,\ngalaxy-impartial SN surveys to uncover the population of SN in dwarf galaxies.\nFuture impartial,\nlarge and deep photometric surveys such as PanSTARRS (Tonry & Pan-STARRS Team 2005), Skymapper (Granlund et al. 2006), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) (Pinto 2004) will hence greatly\ncontribute to the understanding and study of stellar explosions in different galactic environments. Finally, we\nrecommend observational metallicity studies of a statistically significant set of SN Ib, SN Ic, broad-lined SN\nIc and SN II as to investigate any metallicity effects on\nthe properties of core-collapse SN and on the extent of\nprior mass loss, which are expected on theoretical (e.g.,\nWoosley et al. 2002; Woosley & Janka 2005) and stellar\nevolutionary grounds (Crowther & Hadfield 2006).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nM.M. would like to thank Jesse Leaman for making\ndata available before publication and John Moustakas\nfor compiling the published HII region line fluxes for\nM 74.
