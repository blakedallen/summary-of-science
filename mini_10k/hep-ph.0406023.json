The results are calculated for a model\ndecay operator within the point-form spectator approximation. It is found that\nmost theoretical values underestimate the experimental data considerably.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt has long been of interest to describe strong decays of baryon resonances\nwith realistic constituent quark models (CQM). Most of the modern calculations have investigated the effects of the dynamics of the underlying CQM,\nthe nature of the decay operator (e.g., elementary emission vs. quark pair\ncreation) or relativistic corrections 1,2,3,4 . In addition one has faced considerable uncertainties regarding the phase-space factor, since the transition\namplitudes have not been derived in a relativistically invariant manner. Recently, we obtained direct predictions of a relativistic CQM from a Poincar\u00e9\ninvariant calculation of baryon resonance decays in the pion channel 5 .\nThe decay operator was based on the point-form spectator approximation\n(PFSA), an approach that already proved successful in the description of\nthe electroweak structure of the nucleons 6 .\n2. Theory\nHere, we study the \u03c0 and \u03b7 decays of N and \u2206 resonances in a relativistic\napproach. Specifically, the theory is formulated along Poincar\u00e9-invariant\nquantum mechanics 7,8 . We adhere to its point-form version, since it allows to calculate the observables in a manifestly covariant manner 9 . This\napproach, being distinct from a field-theoretic treatment, relies on a rela1\n\n\fDecember 15, 2018\n\n21:7\n\nProceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nMelde\n\n2\n\ntivistically invariant mass operator with the interactions included according\nto the Bakamjian-Thomas construction 10 . Thereby it fulfils all symmetries\nrequired by special relativity. At this instance, we use a rather simplified\nmodel for the decay operator, because our first goal is to set up a fully\nrelativistic CQM formulation of strong decays of baryon resonances.\nBaryons are simultaneous eigenstates of the mass operator M\u0302 and the\nfour-velocity operator V\u0302 (or equivalently of the four-momentum operator\n\u02c6 and its z-component \u03a3\u0302. We\nP\u0303 \u03bc ), the total-angular-momentum operator J,\ndenote these states by the corresponding eigenvalues |v, M, J, \u03a3i. The transition amplitude for the decays is defined in a Poincar\u00e9-invariant fashion,\nunder overall momentum conservation (M vin \u2212 M \u2032 vout = Q\u03c0 ), by\nF (in \u2192 out) = hvout , M \u2032 , J \u2032 , \u03a3\u2032 | D\u0302\u03b1 |vin , M, J, \u03a3i\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u223c d3 k2 d3 k3 d3 k2\u2032 d3 k3\u2032 \u03a8\u22c6M \u2032 J \u2032 \u03a3\u2032 ~ki\u2032 ; \u03bc\u2032i \u03a8MJ\u03a3 ~ki ; \u03bci\nY 1\u22c6\nY 1\nD\u03c32\u2032 \u03bc\u2032 [RW (ki\u2032 , B (vout ))]\nD\u03c32i \u03bci [RW (ki , B (vin ))]\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03c3i\n\n\u03c3i\u2032\n\nhp\u20321 , p\u20322 , p\u20323 ; \u03c31\u2032 , \u03c32\u2032 , \u03c33\u2032 | D\u0302\u03b1\n\n|p1 , p2 , p3 ; \u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the baryon wave functions \u03a8\u22c6M \u2032 J \u2032 \u03a3\u2032 and \u03a8MJ\u03a3 enter as representations of the rest-frame baryon states hM \u2032 , J \u2032 , \u03a3\u2032 | and |M, J, \u03a3i, respectively.\nIn a first attempt, we assume a decay operator in the PFSA with a\npseudo-vector coupling.

Results\nIn table 1 we show the direct predictions for the decay widths in the pion\nchannel for the Goldstone-Boson-Exchange (GBE) 11 and the One-Gluon\nExchange (OGE) 4 CQMs calculated in PFSA. We also include corresponding results for the Instanton-Induced CQM (II) obtained in a Bethe-Salpeter\n\u2217\napproach 12 . It is clearly seen that all but one (the N1535\n) decay widths are\nconsiderably underestimated for all of these relativistic models. Furthermore there is a general trend in the results, namely, the larger the branching\nratio into \u2206\u03c0, the bigger the deviation of the theoretical results from the\nexperimental data. This becomes apparent from the comparison in the last\nfour columns of table 1, where we have quoted the \u2206\u03c0 branching ratios\nand expressed the theoretical predictions as percentage values relative to\nthe experimental widths given by the PDG 13 .\nTable 1.
