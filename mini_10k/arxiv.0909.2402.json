The Zeeman split of the dimer triplet by a staggered field\nis observed at low temperature. With the increase of temperature the effect of random field is\ndetected by a drastic broadening of the triplet excitation. Basic dynamics of dimer in the staggered\nand random fields are experimentally identified in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 .\nPACS numbers: 75.10.Jm, 75.25.+z, 75.50.Ee\n\nExcitations in quantum spin liquids can be viewed as\nstrongly interacting bosonic quasiparticles. This circumstance enables experimental studies of the physics of Bose\nliquids in prototypical quantum magnetic materials1,2,3 .\nSuch experiments are often possible under conditions\nthat can not be realized in more conventional models,\nsuch as 4 He4,5 and ultracold trapped ions6,7 . One recent\ntopic of interest is teh behavior of bosonic quasiparticles\nin the presence of disorder. Exotic new phases such as\nthe Random Singlet state8 , Bose and Mott glasses9 have\nbeen predicted for systems with quenched disorder. In\nreal prototype materials one usually tries to create such\ndisorder by chemical doping10,11 . In the present work\nwe demonstrate an alternative approach: a random magnetic field created by disordered (paramagnetic) ions. We\nshow that such a random field acting on a simple dimerbased quantum spin liquid dramatically alters the excitation spectrum.\nLet us consider the effect of different types of magnetic fields on an isolated S = 1/2 dimer, as shown in\nFig. 1. In a uniform field the excited triplet is split into\nthree levels. Eventually, at high field, |S = 1, S z = 0i\nwill cross the singlet ground state. In the presence of\ninter-dimer interactions, BEC of magnon will occur. If\nlocal fields applied to each dimer spin are antiparallel\nto each other (referred to as \"staggered field\" hereafter)\nthe triplet is split into a singlet and a doublet. The singlet ground state becomes mixed with |S = 1, S z = 0i\nand the total spin is no longer a good quantum number.\nEven in an infinitesimal staggered field the ground state\nbecomes ploarized. Now, if the field direction is spatially\nrandomized, each dimer will experience both a staggered\nand uniform component. The corresponding energy levels can be calculated numerically. The resulting density\nof state (DOS) for excitations in a set of N dimers is\nplotted in the right panel in Fig. 1. The DOS lower and\nhigher boundaries of the DOS spread coincide with the\nlevels of |Sz = 1i and |Sz = \u22121i in the uniform field.\nThe quantum ferrimagnet Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 12 is a rare\npotential realization of this random field effect.

In\nthe adiabatic approximation, the quantum spins are effectively under the internal field from the much slower\nfluctuating classical spins. In this compound, the staggered nature of the exchange field is due to the magnetic structure. The staggered magnetization curves of\ndimers in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 14 were experimentally obtained\nby measuring the temperature dependence of sublattice\nmoments in neutron diffraction. At high temperature, in\nthe paramagnetic phase, the classical spins are thermally\ndisordered and the effective field on the quantum spins is\nrandomly oriented. Then the system can be considered\nas the ensemble of N dimers in a random quasi-static\nfield. As shown in Fig. 1 the effect of this random field\nis to broaden the dimer excitations at T > TN .\nIn the previous inelastic neutron scattering study\nit was shown that the energy scales of excitations in\nthe Fe chains and Cu dimers are well separated13,15 .\nThe lower energy excitations up to 10 meV are Febased spin waves. Preliminary powder experiments13\nand comparative studies in an isostructural compound\nCu2 Sc2 Ge4 O13 16 associated the dispersionless excitations at 24 meV with Cu-dimers.

By adopting a high resolution setup, we identify the split peaks due to the staggered exchange field.\nFurthermore, we observe a drastic broadening of the peak\nprofile at T > TN that can be ascribed to randomly oriented field from thermally fluctuated Fe moments.\nHigh quality single crystals were grown by floating zone\nmethod. The crystal (monoclinic P 21 /m) were found to\nbe twinned, so that both microscopic domains share a\u2217\n- b\u2217 plane. To avoid complications due to twinning, we\nrestrict the measurements to the a\u2217 - b\u2217 plane. In the\nsetups Ia and Ib PG (002) were used for both monochromator and analyzer. The Soller collimations were 48' 60' - 60' - 120' and open - 80' - 80' - open for Ia and\nIb, respectively. In setup II, to achieve high energy resolution, PG (004) for monochromator and PG (002) for\nanalyzer with 30' - 20' - 40' - 120' were used. The setups\nIa and II were performed on HB1 spectrometer in HFIR,\nORNL. The setup Ib was performed on TAS1 spectrometer in JRR-3M, JAEA. In all setups final energy of the\nneutron was fixed at Ef = 14.7meV and PG filter was\ninstalled after the sample to eliminate higher order contamination. A closed cycle He refrigerator was used to\nachieve low temperatures.\nIn a series of energy scans in a wide range of (h k 0)\nspace shown in Fig.2(a) two dispersionless peaks are readily identified: a pronounced one at ~\u03c9 \u223c 24 meV and a\nweaker feature at ~\u03c9 \u223c 31 meV. The experiments were\nperformed in setups Ia and Ib. The former is consistent with the Cu-centered magnetic excitation in previous studies13,16 . Constant energy scan at ~\u03c9 = 24 meV\nand its temperature dependence are shown in Fig.2(b).\nThe observed sinusoidal intensity modulation is characteristics of dimer excitations and is observed in a wide\ntemperature range. In fig. 2(c) the temperature dependence of the peak intensity is shown. The intensity at\nq = (0 2.5 0) was measured at each temperature and then\nsubtracted as background. The decrease of the intensity\nat high temperature is common behavior for magnetic\nexcitations in local spin clusters. The smaller peak at\n~\u03c9 \u223c 31 meV was identified as a Fe-centered excitation,\nas will be discussed below.\nTo obtain a more detailed profile, we performed an\nenergy scan using setup II at T = 2.0 K. As shown in\nFig. 3 it is revealed that the primary peak at ~\u03c9 = 24\nmeV actually has a shoulder structure. The main peak\nis located at 23.5 meV, and a smaller bump is centered\naround 25.0 meV. This splitting is attributed to the staggered exchange field from the adjacent Fe moments. The\nmain peak corresponds to the excitation doublet and the\nsmall one to the singlet.\nEnergy scans collected at several temperatures are\nshown Fig. 4(a). The small peak at ~\u03c9 \u223c 31 meV in\nFig. 2 is temperature independent and has been subtracted from the data. Well-defined peaks are observed\nat all temperatures.

The temperature dependence of peak positions\n(b), widths (c) and integrated intensities (d), as estimated\nfrom Gaussin fits.\n\nintensity decreases by 10 \u223c 20%. It is noted that in the\nprevious powder experiment the peak cannot be distinguished at T \u2265 41 K13 . This is because the powder integration in wide q space collects phonon excitations and\naccidental suprious peaks, masking magnetic excitations\nat higher temperatures.\nFor T < TN we will consider the following effective\nHamiltonian:\nH = JCu S1 * S2 + g\u03bcB S1 * h1 + g\u03bcB S2 * h2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h1 = (0 0 h) and h2 = (0 0 \u2212 h). Here the zaxis is chosen along the ordered Cu moment. The ground\nstate energy EG decreases with the field, EG = \u2212JCu /4\u2212\np\n2 /2, and the excitation triplet splits into\n(2g\u03bcB h)2 + JCu\na singlet and doublet.

For g\u03bcB h \u226a \u2206, the neutron\n\nThe doublet and singlet terms correspond to transverse\nand longitudinal spin fluctuation, respectively. A(h) and\nB(h) are h dependent parameters with A(h) \u2264 1, B(h) \u2264\n1, and A(0) = B(0) = 1. Since the staggered field stabilizes the polarized spin configuration and suppresses\nlongitudinal fluctuation, B(h) decrease with h. Meanwhile A(h) is almost constant in the low field. P (T )\nis a temperature factor, P (T ) = 1/{1 + 2 exp(\u2212\u03b2\u2206d ) +\nexp(\u2212\u03b2\u2206s }. q is the scattering vector, d is the spin separation in each dimer, and \u03b8 is the angle between q and the\nmoment of Cu. We used mCu = (-0.227, 0.035, -0.301)\n\u03bcB 14 to calculate \u03b8. Two types of domains, namely antiferromagntic and crystallographic ones due to twinning,\nare considered.\nThe peak profile in Fig. 3 is reasonably well reproduced\nby the cross section convoluted by experimental resolution function with \u2206s = 25.0 meV and \u2206d = 23.5 meV.\nFrom eqs.(2) and (3), JCu = 22.0 meV and h = 51 T are\nobtained. Let us check the consistency of h with the previous study14 . From the staggered magnetization curve\nby neutron diffraction JCu\u2212Fe /JCu = 0.105 was obtained.\nHere JCu\u2212Fe is the interaction between Cu and Fe spins.\nUsing the molecular field relation h = mFe JCu\u2212Fe /(g\u03bcB )2\nand previously obtained parameters, h \u223c 40 T is estimated. Thus statically estimated value is consistent with\nthat obtained in the present dynamic measurement.\nThe energy splitting between the singlet and doublet\nstates is about 1.5 meV. This value is small compared\nenergy resolution in the typical experimental setup. In\nsetup Ia and Ib at T < TN , therefore, staggered field effect is smeared and two terms in eq.(4) are integrated.\nThen the cross section is approximately equivalent to\nthat at h = 0. Indeed, the constant energy scan at T\n= 3.3 K in Fig. 2(b) is reasonably fitted by dimers cross\nsection in zero field shown by the thick curve.\nAt T > TN effective field on the Cu dimers is randomly oriented. We consider an ensemble of N dimers in\nrandom field. The randomly oriented field h is assumed\nto have a constant magnitude in eq.(1). The resulting\nDOS of the excited states is then calculated numerically.\nThe neutron cross section is assumed to be approximately\nproportional to the DOS,\nk\u2032\nd2 \u03c3\n= (\u03b3r0 )2 sin2 (q.d)f (q)2 Prand (T )D(~\u03c9) (5)\nd\u03a9dE\nk\nR\nwith\nD(\u01eb)d\u01eb = 3N and Prand (T ) = N/(N +\nR\n\u2212 k \u01ebT\nD(\u01eb)e B d\u01eb). The data collected at T \u2265 54 K are well\nreproduced by this cross section convoluted by experimental resolution function, as indicated by solid curves in\nFig. 4(a). The obtained fit parameters are JCu = 22.3(4)\nmeV and h = 41.(8) T. The values are reasonably consistent with those obtained at T \u2264 TN . The q dependence\n\n\f4\nof the cross section is the same as for zero field, and is\ngiven by dimer structure factor sin2 (q.d). Indeed, the q\nscans at 80 K and 300 K in Fig. 2(b) are reproduced by\nthis model. The temperature dependence in Fig. 2(c) is\nwell accounted for by the temperature factor Prand (T ).\nWe shall now discuss the small decrease of the intensity at T < TN in Fig. 4(d). At T > TN dimer spins\nare fluctuated equally in all directions and the dynamical spin correlation is fully detected by neutron. In the\nordered state the polarized magnetic ordering suppresses\nthe longitudinal fluctuation of Cu spins. To estimate\nthe reduction of the longitudinal excitation we calculate\nB(h = 51T) = 0.77. The reduction of B(h) is about 20%\nthat is consistent with the experiment. This means that\n51 T is rather modest compared with the intradimer interaction JCu = 22 meV. If the effective field was large\nand the moment were fully polarized, the suppression\nwould be more drastic. Such a situation is in fact realized in Haldane spin chains coupled to rare earth moment in Pr2 BaNiO5 with fully saturated Ni2+ moment\nat T < TN 17 . The Haldane-gap mode lost half of its\nintensity at T < TN and it was ascribed to the total\nsuppression of longitudinal mode.\nFinally we will mention the temperature independent\nsmall peak at ~\u03c9 \u223c 31 meV in Fig. 2(a). If the Fe S = 5/2\nchains were perfectly isolated from the Cu subsystem,\nthe Fe excitation spectrum would be dominated by one-\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n12\n\ntmasuda@yokohama-cu.ac.jp\nCondensed Matter Science Division, Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6393, USA\nT.

However, a recent theory predicts that the introduction of Cu dimer enhances\nthe multi-magnon excitation of Fe spins at ~\u03c9 = 10JFe ,\n15JFe , 20JFe and 25JFe . According to the Bond operator\nmethod18,19 the excitation at ~\u03c9 = 20JFe is the particularly enhanced20 . Since JFe = 1.6 meV15 , the observed\nsmall peak at ~\u03c9 = 31 meV could be ascribed to the Fe\ncentered longitudinal excitation. Further details will be\npublished somewhere else.\nTo conclude, we have experimentally investigated the\ndynamics of S = 1/2 dimers in staggered and random\nfields in Cu2 Fe2 Ge4 O13 . The staggered field is realized at\nT < TN and produces a splitting of the excitation triplet.\nAt T > TN a random exchange field produces a drastic\nbroadening of these modes. In teh future, polarized neutron experiments may be useful to separate the longitudinal and transverse excitations. Recently Cu2 CdB2 O6 21\nand Cu3 Mo2 O9 22 identified as new realizationsof the coupled dimers and chains models. Particularly in the latter\ncompound, the dimer energy is close to that of the chains,\nand more complex physics is expected.\nProf. M. Matsumoto is greatly appreciated for fruitful discussion.
