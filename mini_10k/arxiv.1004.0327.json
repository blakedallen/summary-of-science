The Brill\u2013Noether theorem asserts that when the Brill\u2013Noether\ns on\nnumber \u03c1(g, s, m) is nonnegative, \u03c1 computes the dimension of the space of series gm\ns 's on a general\na general curve C of genus g, and that when \u03c1 is negative, there are no gm\ncurve. The main qualitative result of [2] is a Brill\u2013Noether-type result for pairs of linear\nseries. A recap is as follows.\ns has a d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-plane provided\nWe say that an s-dimensional linear series gm\nan inclusion\ns\u2212d+r\ns\ngm\u2212d\n+ p1 + * * * + pd ,\u2192 gm\n(1.1)\ns intersects a (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)exists. Geometrically, (1.1) means that the image of the gm\ns\ndimensional linear subspace of P in d-points; such a linear subspace is a \"d-secant (d\u2212r\u22121)plane\".\nNext, let\n\u03bc(d, r, s) := d \u2212 r(s + 1 \u2212 d + r).\n\nThe invariant \u03bc computes the expected dimension of the space of d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes\ns . We prove [2, Thm. 1]:\nalong a fixed gm\ns with\nIf \u03c1 = 0 and \u03bc = \u22121, then a general curve C of genus g admits no linear series gm\nd-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes.\n\n1\n\n\fIn fact, Farkas [9] has proved, more generally, that when \u03c1 + \u03bc < 0, a general curve C\ns with d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes.\nof genus g admits no linear series gm\nAn immediate corollary of the theorem is that whenever \u03c1 = 0 and \u03bc = \u22121, curves with\nd-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes sweep out a divisor inside Mg .\nA couple of words are in order regarding the linear series parameter r. To avoid trivialities, we must have\n1 \u2264 r \u2264 s.\nEach specialization of r defines an infinite family of examples, indexed by the incidence\nparameter d. The two most natural choices are r = 1 and r = s, and in this paper we focus\non the former, which corresponds to the situation studied by Lehn [24] in the context of the\nHilbert scheme of points on a surface. Note that the case r = 1 is \"tautological\" in that it\ncorresponds to the situation in which the evaluation map\nV \u2192 H 0 (L/L(\u2212p1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 pd ))\n\n(1.2)\n\ncorresponding to a given linear series (L, V ) fails to be surjective along a d-tuple of points\np1 , . . . , pd on the curve in question. In general, r is the corank of the map (1.2).\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is an enhanced version of the second part of my doctoral thesis, which was\ncarried out under the supervision of Joe Harris.

In Section 2, we attempt to\nsolve the problem of computing the expected number of linear series with exceptional secant\nplanes in a given one-parameter family by computing the number of exceptional series along\njudiciously-chosen \"test families\". Our general secant plane formula reads\nNdd\u2212r\u22121 = P\u03b1 \u03b1 + P\u03b2 \u03b2 + P\u03b3 \u03b3 + Pc c + P\u03b40 \u03b40\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, c, and \u03b40 are certain tautological invariants associated to the given family.\nFive relations are needed to determine the tautological coefficients P\u03b1 , P\u03b2 , P\u03b3 , Pc , and P\u03b40 .\nWhenever r = 1 or r = s, we find four out of the five relations needed; in general, we\nconjecturally obtain four out of five relations, with a fourth relation hinging on a conjecture\nabout secant planes to K3 surfaces (Conjecture 1, Section 2.2), which we prove under a\ncurvilinearity hypothesis in Theorem 1.\nIn Section 3, we specialize to the case r = 1, where our results are strongest. The\nbasic reason for this is the existence of a comparatively simple generating function for the\n2d\u22122 , namely [2, Thm 4]:\nexpected number Nd of d-secant (d \u2212 2)-planes to a gm\n\u0012\n\u00132g\u22122\u2212m\nX\ng\u22121\n2\nd\nNd (g, m)z =\n* (1 + 4z) 2 .\n(1.4)\n1/2\n(1 + 4z) + 1\nd\u22650\n2\n\n\fOur derivation of (1.4) in our earlier paper [2] follows from the fact that for all d \u2265 2, Nd\nthe degree of a corank-one degeneracy locus of a certain map of vector bundles over the dth\nCartesian product of a curve. Applied to this map, Porteous' formula expresses the degeneracy locus as a determinant in the Chern classes of the vector bundles. A combinatorial\nanalysis enables us to reinterpret this determinant graphically, in terms of weighted counts\nof subgraphs of the complete labeled graph on d vertices. An extension of the same analysis\nyields a graphical interpretation of the missing tautological coefficient P\u03b3 . Nevertheless,\ndeducing a generating function for the coefficients P\u03b3 on the basis of combinatorics alone\nseems difficult.\nIn Section 3.2, we use our generating function for Nd , the relations among tautological\ncoefficients already obtained from evaluating the general secant plane formula (1.3) along\nspecial families, and a conjectural fifth relation obtained via multiple-point formulas in\nSection 4, to (conjecturally) determine generating functions for the tautological coefficients\nP , whenever r = 1. In Section 3.3, we use the generating functions determined in Section 3.2\nin order to realize each of the tautological coefficients P as linear combinations of generalized\nhypergeometric functions.\nIn Section 4, we deduce a conjectural fifth relation among tautological secant plane\ndivisor coefficients whenever r = 1 or r = s, by calculating secant plane formulas in a\nvariety of particular cases. Our computations are based on an application of Kleiman's\nmultiple point formula [18] to the projection of an incidence correspondence of curves and\nsecant planes onto a Grassmann bundle of secant planes. In Section 4.3, we list secant plane\nformulas in a number of particular examples. Most of these enumerative formulas are new.\nSection 5 is devoted to a discussion of Le Barz's cycle-theoretic approach to secant\nplanes, as detailed in [22, 23]. We recast his calculations in a slightly larger degree of\ngenerality, and obtain generalizations of a normal bundle formula [22, Prop. 3bis] of his.\nOur main purpose, however, is to lay the foundation for a future adaptation of Le Barz's\napproach to the setting of one-parameter families.\nIn Section 6.1, we review Deepak Khosla's computation of the Gysin pushforward from\ns ) to A1 (M\nfg,1 ), where M\nfg,1 \u2282 Mg,1 is a partial compactification of the space of smooth\nA1 (Gm\nmarked curves of genus g. Indeed, the present paper should be viewed as a companion to\n[17]. Applying Khosla's result, we compute the coefficients b\u03bb and b0 associated to the Hodge\nclass and the boundary class of irreducible nodal curves, respectively, of secant plane divisor\nclasses on Mg . As a consequence, we deduce in Section 6.2 that the slope of secant plane\ndivisors is computed by bb\u03bb0 whenever r = 1 or r = s and g \u2264 23. We then specialize to the\ncase r = 1, and use our hypergeometric formulas for tautological coefficients to prove, in\nTheorem 5, that secant plane divisors on Mg are nonempty when r = 1. The class of each\nsecant plane divisor depends on the incidence degree, d, as well as a second parameter, a.\nIn Section 6.4, we determine explicit formulas for the slopes of secant plane divisors\nin the case r = 1, for small values of a. We also determine the asymptotics of the slope\nfunction as d approaches infinity, for arbitrary (fixed) values a.\nIn Section 7, we compute the coefficients b1 and b2 (corresponding to boundary classes\n\u03b41 and \u03b42 , respectively)) of secant plane divisors on Mg , as functions of b\u03bb and b0 . Our\nTheorem 7 states that the pullback of any secant plane divisor class Sec under the map\nj2 : M2,1 \u2192 Mg given by attaching marked genus-2 curves to a general \"broken flag\" curve\nis supported along the locus of curves with marked Weierstrass points.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nOne-parameter families of curves with linear series\n\nGiven a complete curve B, let \u03c0 : X \u2192 B denote a flat family of curves over B whose\ngeneric fiber is smooth, with some finite number of special fibers that are irreducible curves\ns . That is, X comes\nwith nodes. We equip each fiber of \u03c0 with an s-dimensional series gm\nequipped with a line bundle L, and on B there is a vector bundle V of rank (s + 1), such\nthat\nV ,\u2192 \u03c0\u2217 L.\nIf \u03bc = \u22121, we expect finitely many fibers of \u03c0 to admit linear series with d-secant (d\u2212r \u22121)planes. We then ask for a formula for the number of such series, given in terms of tautological\ninvariants associated with the family \u03c0.\nZiv Ran's work on Hilbert schemes of nodal curves [26, 27] shows that the number of\nd-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes is a function Ndd\u2212r\u22121 of tautological invariants of the family \u03c0,\nnamely:\n\u03b1 := \u03c0\u2217 (c21 (L)), \u03b2 := \u03c0\u2217 (c1 (L) * \u03c9), \u03b3 := \u03c0\u2217 (\u03c9 2 ), \u03b40 , and c := c1 (V)\nwhere \u03c9 = c1 (\u03c9X /B ) and where \u03b40 denotes the locus of points b \u2208 B for which the corresponding fiber Xb is singular.\nMore to the point, Ndd\u2212r\u22121 computes the degree of a the rank-(d \u2212 r) locus for a map\nof vector bundles\nV \u2192 T d (L)\n(2.1)\n[d]\n\nover the Hilbert scheme XB of degree-d subschemes of fibers of \u03c0. Above a point with\nsupport (p1 , . . . , pd ), the map (2.1) is precisely the evaluation map (1.2) mentioned earlier.\nFor any fixed choice of s, Porteous' formula, in tandem with Ran's calculus for intersections\n[d]\nof tautological classes on XB , enables us to deduce that\nNdd\u2212r\u22121 = P\u03b1 \u03b1 + P\u03b2 \u03b2 + P\u03b3 \u03b3 + Pc c + P\u03b40 \u03b40\n(2.2)\nwhere the arguments P are polynomials in m and g with coefficients in Q.\nBecause such a formula (2.2) in tautological invariants exists, the problem of evaluating\nit reduces to producing sufficiently many relations among the coefficients P . In [2], we\nobtain three of these. Namely, we have:\n1. 2mP\u03b1 + (2g \u2212 2)P\u03b2 + (s + 1)Pc = 0.\nThis relation arises because (2.2) is invariant under the renormalization L 7\u2192 L \u2297\n\u03c0 \u2217 O(D) that trivializes V.\n2. Pc = \u2212A(d, g, m), where A(d, g, m) is the number of d-secant (d \u2212 r)-planes to a\ngeneral curve of degree m and genus g in Ps+1 that intersect a general line.\nThis relation arises from evaluating (2.2) along the family of projections of a general\ncurve of degree m in Ps+1 from points along a disjoint line.\n3. (\u22122m \u2212 2g)P\u03b1 + (2 \u2212 2g)P\u03b2 + (\u2212m \u2212 1)Pc = (d + 1)A0 (d, g, m), where A0 (d, g, m) is\nthe number of (d + 1)-secant (d \u2212 r)-planes to a general curve of degree (m + 1) and\ngenus g in Ps+1 .\nThis relation arises from evaluating (2.2) along the family of projections of a generic\ncurve of degree m + 1 in Ps+1 from points along the curve.\n4\n\n\fNote that the families corresponding to the second and third relations are isotrivial.\n\n2.1\n\nA non-isotrivial family arising from K3 surfaces\n\nLet S denote a K3 surface in Ps , such that\nPic S = ZH \u2295 Z[C].\nwhere H is the class of a hyperplane section, while C is a smooth, irreducible curve of\ngenus g such that C * H = m. Such surfaces exist, for a dense set of (d, m, s), by [20, Thm.\n1.1]. The base locus of a pencil of curves of class [C] consists of [C]2 = (2g \u2212 2) points.\nAccordingly, we set\nX = Bl2g\u22122 pts S and B = P1 ,\nand let \u03c0 : X \u2192 B denote the projection associated to a particular choice of base point.\nClearly, c1 (L) = H. Likewise, the relative dualizing sheaf of our family is given by\n\u03c9X /P1 = \u03c9X \u2297 \u03c0 \u2217 OP1 (2).\nNow let f denote the class of a fiber of \u03c0, and let Ei , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2g \u2212 2, denote the classes of\nthe exceptional divisors of the blow-up X \u2192 S. Then\n\u03c9 = KX + 2f\n=\n\n2g\u22122\nX\n\n\u0012\nEi + 2 [C] \u2212\n\ni=1\n\n2g\u22122\nX\n\n\u0013\nEi\n\ni=1\n\n= 2[C] \u2212\n\n2g\u22122\nX\n\nEi .\n\ni=1\n\nWhence,\n2\n\n\u03b3 = 4[C] +\n\n2g\u22122\nX\n\nEi2 = 6g \u2212 6, \u03b1 = H 2 = 2s \u2212 2, and\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b2 = 2[C] * H = 2m.\nWe compute \u03b40 as follows. Let C2 \u2282 H 0 (OS (C)) denote the two-dimensional subspace\nof sections defining our pencil. Let X2 denote the fiber product X \u00d7P1 X , equipped with\nprojections \u03c01 and \u03c02 onto each of its factors. Now let\nE := (\u03c01 )\u2217 (\u03c02\u2217 OX (C) \u2297 OX2 /OX2 (\u2212\u2206));\nover p \u2208 P1 , Ep comprises sections of OS (C) modulo those vanishing to order 2 at p.\nNote that the singular fibers of \u03c0 comprise the locus where the evaluation map\nev\nC2 \u2297 OS \u2212\u2192 E\nfails to be surjective. It follows that \u03b40 = c2 (E). On the other hand, it is not hard to see\nthat there is an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 OS (C) \u2297 TS\u2217 \u2192 E \u2192 OS (C) \u2192 0;\n5\n\n\fit follows that\nct (E) = ct (OS (C)) * ct (OS (C) \u2297 TS\u2217 )\n= (1 + t[C]) * (1 + t(\u03b11 + 2[C]) + t2 (\u03b11 [C] + [C]2 + \u03b12 ))\nwhere \u03b1i = ci (TS\u2217 ). We deduce that\n\u03b40 = 2\u03b11 [C] + 3[C]2 + \u03b12 .\nHere \u03b11 = c1 (KS ) =\n\nP2g\u22122\ni=1\n\nEi , while\n\u03b12 = 24\n\nis the topological Euler characteristic of S. It follows that \u03b40 = 6g + 18.\nFinally, the vector bundle V \u2192 P1 is trivial, since the Ps to which the fibers of X \u2192 P1\nmap is fixed. So c = 0.\nTherefore, the third family yields the relation\n(2s \u2212 2)P\u03b1 + 2mP\u03b2 + (6g \u2212 6)P\u03b3 + (6g + 18)P\u03b40 = NK3\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere NK3 denotes the number of fibers of \u03c0 with exceptional secant plane behavior.\n\n2.2\n\nThe value of NK3\n\nIf r = 1, then \u03bc = \u22121 forces d = 2s \u2212 1 and d \u2212 r \u2212 1 = s \u2212 2, so S admits no d-secant\n(d \u2212 2)-planes, by [19, Thm. 1.1]. It follows that NK3 = 0 when r = 1. At the other\nextreme, if r = s then the assumption that \u03bc = \u22121 forces\nd = 2s \u2212 1 and d \u2212 r \u2212 1 = s \u2212 2.\nBy B\u00e9zout's theorem, the degree-(2s \u2212 2) surface S admits no (s \u2212 2)-planes, so again we\nhave NK3 = 0.\nFor a general choice of (d, m, r, s), the value of NK3 is unclear. However, we conjecture\nthat the following is true.\nConjecture 1. Let S \u2282 Ps be a K3 surface with Picard group\nPic S = ZL \u2295 Z\u039b\nwhere\nL2 = 2s \u2212 2, \u039b2 = 2g \u2212 2, and \u039b * L = m.\nIf\n\u03c1(g, s, m) = 0 and \u03bc(d, s, r) = \u22121,\n\n(2.4)\n\nthen S admits no d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes, except possibly when m = 2s and g = s + 1.\n\n6\n\n\fNB: The hypothesis that \u03c1(g, s, m) = 0 implies that\nm = s(a + 1), and g = (s + 1)a,\n\n(2.5)\n\nfor some positive integer a. When a = 1, i.e., when m = 2s and g = s+1, the curves of class\nL on S are canonical curves. As soon as any such curve admits a d-secant (d\u2212r\u22121)-plane, it\nadmits an r-dimensional family of such secant planes. Consequently, those canonical curves\nwith d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes comprise a locus of codimension at least 2. As a result, the\ncase a = 1 has no bearing on our determination (in Sections 4-6) of the classes of secant\ns or M .\nplane divisors on Gm\ng\nThe remainder of the section will be devoted to a proof of the following result.\nTheorem 1. With the same hypotheses on S as in Conjecture 1, S admits no curvilinear\nd-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes.\nProof. Assume, for the sake of argument, that S admits a curvilinear d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)plane. Let Z \u2282 S denote the corresponding subscheme. Since Z is curvilinear, Z is\ncontained in a smooth hyperplane section Y of S, not necessarily unique.\nNote H 1 (S, L) = 0, because L is globally generated. Whence, the exact sequence defining Z in S\n0 \u2192 L \u2297 IZ/X \u2192 L \u2192 L \u2297 OZ \u2192 0\ninduces an exact sequence\nev\n0 \u2192 H 0 (S, L \u2297 IZ/S ) \u2192 H 0 (S, L) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (S, OZ ) \u2192 H 1 (S, L \u2297 IZ/S ) \u2192 0\nin cohomology. Here h0 (S, OZ ) = d, and rk(ev) = d \u2212 r because Z determines a d-secant\n(d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-plane to S, by assumption. It follows that\nh1 (S, L \u2297 IZ/S ) = r.\nOn the other hand, we clearly have\nL \u2297 IY /S \u223c\n= OS ,\nwhile the adjunction theorem on S implies IZ/Y (KS + L) \u223c\n= OY (KY \u2212 Z), i.e., that\nL \u2297 IZ/Y \u223c\n= OY (KY \u2212 Z).\nIt follows that the exact sequence of (twisted) ideal sheaves\n0 \u2192 L \u2297 IY /S \u2192 L \u2297 IZ/S \u2192 L \u2297 IZ/Y \u2192 0\ninduces an exact sequence\nH 1 (S, OS ) \u2192 H 1 (S, L \u2297 IZ/S ) \u2192 H 1 (Y, OY (KY \u2212 Z)) \u2192 H 2 (S, OS )\n\u2192 H 2 (S, L \u2297 IZ/S )\n\n7\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fin cohomology. Here H 1 (S, OS ) = 0, while\nH 2 (S, OS ) \u223c\n= H 0 (S, KS )\u2228 \u223c\n= H 0 (S, OS )\u2228 \u223c\n= C,\nH 1 (Y, OY (KY \u2212 Z)) \u223c\n= H 0 (Y, OY (Z)), and\nH 2 (S, L \u2297 IZ/S ) \u223c\n= H 2 (S, L) \u223c\n= H 0 (S, \u2212L)\u2228 = 0.\nBy (2.6), it follows that Z defines a gdr with \u03c1(g, r, d) = \u22121 along the canonical curve Y .\nNote that Lazarsfeld's theorem [21, Lem. 1.3] states that provided there are no multiple\nor reducible curves of class L on S, the gdr defined by Z is Brill\u2013Noether general, which\nyields the desired contradiction. More precisely, Lazarsfeld shows that provided a certain\nvector bundle F admits no nontrivial endomorphisms, there are no multiple or reducible\ncurves of class L on S. Further, as was pointed out in [11], to show that F admits no\nnontrivial endomorphisms, it suffices to show that on X there is no decomposition\nL=M +N\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere M and N are effective and verify h0 (M ) \u2265 2, h0 (N ) \u2265 2.\nTo see why, recall that the argument of [21, Lem. 1.3] establishes that if F admits\nnontrivial endomorphisms, then c1 (F \u2217 ) = L decomposes nontrivially as a sum of effective\nclasses M + N , where\nf) and N = c1 (N\ne)\nM = c1 (M\nf and N\ne of F \u2217 . But Lazarsfeld also shows\nfor suitably chosen coherent sheaf quotients M\n\u2217\nf\ne are also generated by their\nthat F is generated by its global sections, so det M and det N\n0\nglobal sections (and are nontrivial); it follows that h (M ) \u2265 2 and h0 (N ) \u2265 2.\nTo show that no decomposition (2.7) exists, we assume the opposite and argue for a\nf and det N\ne are\ncontradiction. Note that if a decomposition (2.7) exists, then because det M\n1\n1\ngenerated by their global sections, h (M ) = h (N ) = 0, and the Riemann-Roch formula\nyields\n1\n1\nh0 (M ) = 2 + M 2 and h0 (N ) = 2 + N 2 .\n2\n2\nSince h0 (M ) \u2265 2, h0 (N ) \u2265 2, we have\nM 2 \u2265 0 and N 2 \u2265 0.\n\n(2.8)\n\nM * \u039b \u2265 0 and N * \u039b \u2265 0.\n\n(2.9)\n\nOn the other hand, we also have\n\nNow let\nM = \u03b1L + \u03b2\u039b and N = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)L \u2212 \u03b2\u039b.\n\n8\n\n\fThen\nM 2 = (\u03b1L + \u03b2\u039b)2\n= \u03b12 (2s \u2212 2) + \u03b2 2 (2g \u2212 2) + 2\u03b1\u03b2m \u2265 0,\nN 2 = ((1 \u2212 \u03b1)L \u2212 \u03b2\u039b)2\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b1)2 (2s \u2212 2) + \u03b2 2 (2g \u2212 2) \u2212 2(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b2m \u2265 0,\nM * \u039b = (\u03b1L + \u03b2\u039b) * \u039b\n= \u03b1m + \u03b2(2g \u2212 2) \u2265 0, and\nN * \u039b = ((1 \u2212 \u03b1)L \u2212 \u03b2\u039b) * \u039b = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)m \u2212 \u03b2(2g \u2212 2) \u2265 0.\nNote that the last two inequalities combine to yield\n0 \u2264 \u03b1m + \u03b2(2g \u2212 2) \u2264 m.\n\n(2.10)\n\nThere are now two cases to consider, namely: (\u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 < 0), and (\u03b1 < 0, \u03b2 > 0). The\nargument is virtually identical in either case; we present it in the first case.\nFirst, observe that (2.10) implies that\n\u2212\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n(2g \u2212 2) \u2264 m \u2264 \u2212\n(2g \u2212 2).\n\u03b1\n(\u03b1 \u2212 1)\n\n(2.11)\n\nSimilarly, the inequality deduced from M 2 \u2265 0 above implies that\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nm \u2264 \u2212 (s \u2212 1) \u2212 (g \u2212 1).\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\n(2.12)\n\nNow let x = \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 > 0. Then (2.12) may be rewritten as\n(g \u2212 1)x2 \u2212 mx + (s \u2212 1) \u2265 0.\nThe left-hand side of (2.11) forces\np\nm2 \u2212 4(g \u2212 1)(s \u2212 1)\n, i.e.,\nx\u2264\n2g \u2212 2\np\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm \u2212 m2 \u2212 4(g \u2212 1)(s \u2212 1)\n\u2212\u03b2 \u2264\n\u03b1.\n2g \u2212 2\nm\u2212\n\nThe right-hand side of (2.11) now forces\np\n\u03b1\nm \u2264 (m \u2212 m2 \u2212 4(g \u2212 1)(s \u2212 1))\n, i.e.,\n\u03b1\u22121\np\nm2 \u2212 4(g \u2212 1)(s \u2212 1)\n1\n1\u2212 \u22641\u2212\n, i.e.,\n\u03b1\nm\nm\n\u03b1\u2264 p\n.\n2\nm \u2212 4(g \u2212 1)(s \u2212 1)\nNext, we apply (2.5), with a \u2265 2. We deduce that \u03b1 \u2264 1 necessarily, except when a = 2,\nwhen \u03b1 = 2 is also a possibility.\nSimilarly, if (\u03b1 < 0, \u03b2 > 0), we conclude that \u2212\u03b1 \u2264 1 except possibly when a = 2, when\n\u03b1 = \u22122 is also a possibility.\nWe now analyze the possibilities that remain.\n9\n\n\f\u2022 If \u03b1 = 1, then the left-hand side of (2.10) yields \u2212\u03b2 \u2264\n\u03b2 = 0.\n\nm\n2g\u22122\n\n=\n\ns(a+1)\n2(s+1)a\u22122 ,\n\nwhich forces\n\n\u2022 Similarly, if \u03b1 = 0, then the right-hand side of (2.10) yields \u03b2 = 0.\ns(a+1)\nm\n\u2022 If \u03b1 = \u22121, then the right-hand side of (2.10) yields \u03b2 \u2264 g\u22121\n= (s+1)a\u22121\n, so that\n\u03b2 = 0 or 1. Then (2.10) forces \u03b2 = 1. But then M *L = (\u2212L+\u039b)*L = m\u2212(2g\u22122) \u2265 0\nforces m \u2265 2g \u2212 2, which contradicts (2.5).\n\n\u2022 If a = 2 and \u03b1 = \u22122, then the right-hand side of (2.10) forces \u03b2 \u2264 2. So either\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u22122, 1), or (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u22122, 2). But the left-hand side of (2.10) precludes\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u22122, 1), and the condition that N 2 \u2265 0 precludes (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u22122, 2).\nWe conclude immediately.\nIn light of the preceding result, to prove Conjecture 1 it would suffice to show that\nthe curvilinear locus is open in the space of d-secant (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-planes to S. Perhaps the\nsmoothability tests developed recently by Erman and Velasco [8] can help shed light on this\nproblem of deformation theory.\n\n3\n\nThe case r = 1\n\nAs mentioned in the Roadmap, our results are strongest when r = 1, in which case our\n2d\u22121 's. In this situation, the basic\nsecant plane formula counts d-secant (d \u2212 2)-planes to gm\ninvariants A(d, g, m) and A0 (d, g, m) defined in Section 2 satisfy\nA(d, g, m) = A0 (d \u2212 1, g, m),\nbecause d-secant (d \u2212 1)-planes to a curve C of degree m and genus g in P2d that intersect\na disjoint line l are in bijection with d-secant (d \u2212 2)-planes to the image \u03c0l (C) of C under\nthe projection with center l.

Any such monomial m may be encoded as a (multi)graph, whose\nedges eij , which may appear with multiplicity, are in bijection with the small diagonals \u2206ij\ndividing m.

In fact, since\nthe aim of this subsection is to calculate P\u03b3 , it suffices to consider families \u03c0 : X \u2192 B all of\nwhose fibers are smooth. Accordingly, we work on the relative Cartesian product XBd , relative\nthan the relative Hilbert scheme XBd .

In this section, we will describe\nan alternative method for computing secant plane divisor classes. Using this alternative\napproach, we are led to the following conjecture, which is borne out in every computable\ncase.\nConjecture 3.

As before,\nwe let \u03c0 : X \u2192 B denote a one-parameter family of curves, whose total space X comes\nequipped with a line bundle L, and whose base space B comes equipped with a rank-(s + 1)\nvector bundle V ,\u2192 \u03c0\u2217 L. When either r = 1 or r = s (and, conjecturally, in general), the\nfact that NK3 = 0 expresses the coefficient P\u03b40 in terms of the other secant plane divisor\ncoefficients, none of which depend upon the number of singular fibers in \u03c0. Consequently,\nwe will assume that every fiber of \u03c0 is a smooth curve. As before, the pair (L, V) defines\na map f : X \u2192 PV \u2217 of B-schemes, whose fibers over points in B are maps from curves to\ns-dimensional projective spaces.\nNow let G denote the Grassmann bundle of (d \u2212 r \u2212 1)-dimensional subspaces of fibers of\nPV \u2217 over B, and let IX \u2282 X \u00d7B G denote the incidence correspondence canonically obtained\nfrom f . The secant plane locus of interest to us is (the pushforward to B of) Kleiman's dth\nmultiple-point locus [18] associated with the projection \u03c1 : IX \u2192 G. Because every fiber\n22\n\n\fof \u03c0 is a smooth curve, \u03c0 is a curvilinear map. Consequently, according to [15], the Chow\nclass mk of the kth multiple point locus of \u03c1 satisfies\nmk = \u03c1\u2217 \u03c1\u2217 mk\u22121 +\n\nk\nX\n(\u22121)i pi mk\u2212i\n\n(4.3)\n\ni=1\n\nfor certain polynomials pi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k in the Chern classes of the virtual normal bundle N\u03c1\nof \u03c1. Note that [16, bot. p.11] gives an explicit generating series for the polynomials pi .\n\n4.2\n\nEvaluation of multiple-point formulas\n\nEvaluating the iterative formulas (4.3) requires computing the Chern classes of the virtual\nnormal bundle N\u03c1 . These we calculate as follows. Letting QG denote the quotient bundle\non G, note that because IX \u2282 X \u00d7B G is the zero locus of the natural map of vector bundles\nL\u2217 \u2192 QG ,\nits normal bundle NIX /X \u00d7B G is simply the pullback of L \u2297 QG to IX . On the other hand,\nNIX /X \u00d7B G and N\u03c1 fit into an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 TX /B \u2192 NIX /X \u00d7B G \u2192 N\u03c1 \u2192 0,\nwhich implies that their Chern polynomials are related by\nct (N\u03c1 ) = c(\u2212TX /B )c(NIX /X \u00d7B G )\n= (1 + t\u03c9 + t2 \u03c9 2 )c(NIX /X \u00d7B G )\nwhere \u03c9 = c1 (\u03c9X /B ) is the first Chern class of the relative dualizing sheaf of \u03c0.\nIt is now a relatively straightforward matter to write a computer program to compute\nsecant plane divisor classes; this we have done in Maple [25].

Le Barz adopts a different approach to the enumeration of secant planes\nof (fixed) projective curves, based on the theory of excess intersection. Here we review his\nmethod, recasting it in slightly more generality, compare it to our own, and suggest how\none might adapt it to the setting of one-parameter families of curves with linear series.\n\n5.1\n\nCycles in the Grassmannian associated to secant planes\n\nLet n \u2265 1, and assume that C \u2282 Pn is a smooth curve of degree m and genus g. Fix d0 < n,\nand set G := G(d0 , n). Requiring a d0 -plane to intersect C is a codimension-(n \u2212 d0 \u2212 1)condition; accordingly, those d0 -planes that have degree-k intersections with C have expected\ncodimension k(n \u2212 d0 \u2212 1) in G. While it is not necessarily the case that the actual and\nexpected codimensions agree, nevertheless there is always a well-defined k-secant cycle class\n0\nSeck (C) \u2208 Ak(n\u2212d \u22121) (G), obtained as follows.\n24\n\n\fLet S denote the tautological rank-(d0 + 1) subbundle of G, and let T = P(S) ,\u2192 G \u00d7 Pn\nbe the corresponding projective bundle. Then\nCok (d0 , n) := T [k]\nis the incidence scheme of pairs (\u039b, Y ) where Y \u2282 \u039b is a scheme of k coplanar points. The\nincidence scheme comes equipped with projections s and t to G and (Pn )[k] , respectively.\n0\nHere s : Cok (d0 , n) \u2192 G is a fibration with d0 k-dimensional fiber (Pd )[k] . Whence,\ndim Cok (d0 , n) = d0 k + (d0 + 1)(n \u2212 d0 ).\nThe incidence scheme contains a distinguished subscheme\nZ := t\u22121 (C [k] )\nmade up of pairs (\u039b, Y ) with Y \u2282 \u039b \u2229 C. Note that the embedding of C in Pn canonically\ninduces a codimension-(nk \u2212k) embedding of C [k] in (Pn )[k] , for every positive integer k \u2265 1.\nThe expected dimension of Z is thus\nexp. dim Z = dim Cok (d0 , n) \u2212 (nk \u2212 k)\n= (d0 + 1)(n \u2212 d0 ) + k \u2212 k(n \u2212 d0 ).\nOn the other hand, when k is sufficiently large relative to m and n, we have\nZ\u223c\n= C [k] \u00d7 G(C)\nwhere G(C) \u2282 G is the subvariety of d0 -planes containing C. In particular, the difference\nbetween the actual and expected dimensions of Z is\ne = k + (d0 \u2212 \u03b3)(n \u2212 d0 ) \u2212 [(d0 + 1)(n \u2212 d0 ) + k \u2212 k(n \u2212 d0 )]\n= (k \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 1)(n \u2212 d0 )\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = dim \u0393 is the dimension of the linear span \u0393 of C. Note that G(C) = G(\u0393).\nFinally, let j denote the inclusion of Z in Cok (d0 , n), and set\n0\n\nSeckd ,n (C) := s\u2217 j\u2217 (C [k] * Cok (d0 , n)).\n\n5.2\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe case r = 1\n\nWe have\nZg,m (z) =\n\nX\n\ndeg(Secdd\u22122,2d\u22122 (C))td .\n\nd\u22650\n\nLe Barz's determination of Zg,m (z) is based on 2 principles, namely:\n1. Zg,m (z) satisfies a multiplicativity property; namely,\nZg1 +g2 \u22121,m1 +m2 (z) = Zg1 ,m1 (z) * Zg2 ,m2 (z).\n25\n\n(5.3)\n\n\f2. For any particular values of g and m, Zg,m (z) may be computed using Fulton's excess\nintersection formula, in tandem with Schubert calculus.\nMultiplicativity. Let C1 and C2 be disjoint smooth curves in P2d\u22122 of degrees m1 , m2\nand genera g1 , g2 , respectively. By cleverly specializing the relative positions of C1 and C2 ,\nLe Barz shows [23, Lemme 2] that the number of d-secant (d \u2212 2)-planes to C1 \u222a C2 is given\nby\nd\nX\nNd =\nNi Nd\u2212i ,\ni=0\n\nwhich immediately implies (5.3).\nf\n\nDetermination of Zg,m (z) for particular values of g and m. Let C ,\u2192 Pn be a\nsmooth curve of genus g, embedded via a linear series of degree m. Correspondingly, for\nevery integer k \u2265 1, there is an induced inclusions of Hilbert schemes f [k] : C [k] ,\u2192 (Pn )[k] .\nAs explained in [22], for k >> 0, the excess intersection formula realizes the intersection\nproduct (5.2) as the eth Chern class of the virtual normal bundle\nF := t\u2217 Nf [k] \u2212 NZ/Cok (d,n)\nwhere e is defined as in (5.1).\nThe fundamental exact sequence. Let Tk \u2282 C [k] \u00d7 C denote the tautological incidence\ncorrespondence, equipped with its natural projections pk and q to C [k] and C, respectively.\nMoreover, let\n\u03c6k+1 : C [k] \u00d7 C \u2192 C [k+1]\ndenote the map defined by summation of cycles.\nA result of Ran [26] establishes that the bundles Nf [k] relate to one another via the\nfollowing short exact sequences, for all k \u2265 1:\n0 \u2192 q \u2217 Nf \u2297 O(\u2212Tk ) \u2192 \u03c6\u2217k+1 Nf [k+1] \u2192 p\u2217k Nf [k] \u2192 0\n\n(5.4)\n\nNote that Nf = f \u2217 TPn /TC . Whence, an easy application of the Euler sequence for Pn\nyields\nct (Nf ) = 1 + Lt\nwhere L = [(n + 1)m + 2g \u2212 2]{pt}.\nThe Chern polynomial of Nf [k] splits linearly. It is natural to pull back the fundamental exact sequence (5.4) to the Cartesian product C k+1 . In doing so, we adopt the following\nnotational convention: for all l \u2265 k, the symmetric product C [k] in (5.4) is the quotient of\nthe first k copies of C in the Cartesian product C l . Doing so allows us to unambiguously\nomit pullbacks. The sequence (5.4) pulls back to the following sequence on C k+1 :\n0 \u2192 Nf \u2297 O(\u2212\u2206k+1 ) \u2192 Nf [k+1] \u2192 Nf [k] \u2192 0\n\n26\n\n(5.5)\n\n\fwhere \u2206k+1 is the \"large\" diagonal comprising (k + 1)-tuples (xi )k+1\ni=1 such that xj = xk+1\nk\nfor some index 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. It follows immediately that on C , the Chern polynomial of Nf [k]\nsplits linearly in the same fashion as the kth secant bundle:\nct (Nf [k] ) =\n\nk\nY\n\n[1 + (L \u2212 \u2206j )t]\n\n(5.6)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u22061 := 0. Indeed, it is a conceivable that the graph-theoretic interpretation of Nd , and\nof tautological coefficients (in the setting of one-parameter families of curves) described in\nSubsection 3.1 can be explained on the basis of Le Barz's cycle-theoretic approach, though\nwe haven't pursued this.\nPreliminaries regarding the Chern classes of NZ/Cok (d,n) . Let \u0393 denote the linear\nspan of C, and let G(C) = G(\u0393) \u2282 G(d, n) denote the subvariety of d-planes containing C.\nLet W := Cok (d, n), and Y := s\u22121 G(C). Note that Z is contained in Y , and we have\nct (NZ/W ) = ct (NZ/Y )ct (NY /W )|Z .\nMoreover, because s is a fibration,\nNY /W = s0,\u2217 NG(X)/G(d,n) = s0,\u2217 NG(\u0393)/G(d,n)\nwhere s0 = s|Y .\nNow note that\nNG(\u0393)/G(d,n) = (Q0 )\u2295\u03b3+1\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere Q0 is the tautological quotient bundle on G(C), and \u03b3 = dim(\u0393). Indeed, when \u0393 is\na point, (5.7) follows easily from the standard description of the tangent space to G(d, n),\nand the exact sequence that realizes NG(\u0393)/G(d,n) as a quotient of TG(d,n) . In general, (5.7)\nfollows inductively, using a filtration of \u0393 by a complete flag of linear subspaces.\nIt follows that\nct (NY /W ) = s0,\u2217 ct (Q0 )\u2295\u03b3+1 .\n\n(5.8)\n\nThe Chern polynomial of NZ/Y may be computed as follows. Let fe : G(\u0393) \u00d7 X \u2192 P(S|G(\u0393) )\ndenote the canonical inclusion. Whenever k is large, we have NZ/Y = Nfe[k] , where\nfe[k] : G(\u0393) \u00d7 C [k] \u2192 P(S \u2217 |G(\u0393) )[k]\nis the canonically-induced inclusion of Hilbert schemes. The obvious generalizations of (5.4)\nand (5.5) allow ct (Nfe[k] ) to be computed inductively, given ct (Nfe).\nAn auxiliary exact sequence, and a key technical lemma for normal bundles.\nThe calculation of Nf [k] and Nfe[k] fits into the following more general framework. Namely,\nlet B be a variety, and let E be a rank-(n + 1) vector bundle over B. Let \u03a3 = P(E \u2217 )\ne be a fixed (\u03b3 + 1)-dimensional vector space, with\nbe the corresponding Pn -bundle. Let \u0393\n27\n\n\fe \u2217 ). Here B \u00d7 \u0393 \u2282 \u03a3 is a trivial subbundle. Now let C \u2282 \u0393 denote a fixed smooth\n\u0393 = P(\u0393\ncurve of degree m and genus g with linear span \u0393. We have embeddings\nfe[k] : B \u00d7 C [k] ,\u2192 (\u03a3/B)[k]\nfor all k \u2265 1, where (\u03a3/B)[k] denotes the kth relative Hilbert scheme of the B-scheme \u03a3.\nIn [22], Le Barz computes Nge[k] in the cases where C is either a line or a conic; because\nof the multiplicativity property (5.3) of Zg,m (z), these two cases suffice. To do so, he uses\nan immediate generalization of the fundamental exact sequence (5.4) that relates Nfe[k] and\nNfe[k+1] , namely:\n0 \u2192 q \u2217 Nfe \u2297 O(\u2212Tk ) \u2192 \u03c6\u2217k+1 Nfe[k+1] \u2192 p\u2217k Nfe[k] \u2192 0\n\n(5.9)\n\nHe also makes use of two crucial additional inputs. The first of these is the fact that\nthe classes of the tautological divisor and the pullback via the summation map \u03c6[k+1] :\nC [k] \u00d7 C \u2192 C [k+1] of the hyperplane class Hk on C [k] \u223c\n= Pk are given, respectively, by\nTk = Pk + kQ, and \u03c6\u2217k Hk = Pk + Q\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere Pk = p\u2217k Hk , and Q = q \u2217 {ptC }.\nThe second input is the following short exact sequence on C \u223c\n= P1 , valid for all k \u2265 1:\n0 \u2192 O(\u2212(k \u2212 1)) \u2192 O\u2295k \u2192 O(1)\u2295k\u22121 \u2192 0.\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe auxiliary sequence (5.11) becomes useful when pulled back to C [k] \u00d7 C \u00d7 B, where it\nimplies that for all k \u2265 1 and for every vector bundle \u039e on C [k] \u00d7 C \u00d7 B,\n0 \u2192 \u039e(\u2212(k \u2212 1)Q) \u2192 \u039e\u2295k \u2192 \u039e(Q)\u2295k\u22121 \u2192 0\n\n(5.12)\n\nis exact. Applying (5.12), (5.4), and the first input (5.10) exactly as in the proof of [22,\nProp. 3], we deduce the following result for degree-m rational curves.\nTheorem 3. For all k \u2265 1, m > 1,\nct (Nfe[k] ) = ct (\u00ca)m+1 * ct (\u00ca \u2297 O(\u2212Hk ))k\u2212m\u22121 * (1 \u2212 Hk t)k+1\u2212(\u03b3+1)m\n\n(5.13)\n\ne\nwhere \u00ca = E/(B \u00d7 \u0393).\nThe formula (5.13) generalizes Le Barz's [22, Prop. 3bis]. In fact, however, we can go\nfurther. Namely, assume that g > 0. In that case, the analogue of the hyperplane class Hk\nis played by the class xk of the locus Xk, \u2282 C [k] comprising k-cycles whose support contains\na fixed point in C. Indeed, as explained in [1, Ch. 7, Prop. 2.1], O(Xk, ) is canonically\nisomorphic to the polarization O(1) on the projective bundle given by C [k] \u2192 Pick (C)\nwhenever k \u2265 2g \u2212 1.\nAccordingly, applying [1, p. 338], we find that for g \u2265 1, the analogue of the first input\n(5.10) is given by\nTk = Pk + \u03b3 + kQ, and \u03c6\u2217k Hk = Pk + Q\n(5.14)\nwhere Pk = p\u2217k xk , Q is as before, and \u03b3 is the (1, 1)-part of the class of the diagonal\n\u2206 \u2282 C \u00d7C. Recall that the (1, 1)-parts of H \u2217 (C [k] \u00d7C, Q) and H \u2217 (C \u00d7C, Q) are isomorphic\nfor all k \u2265 1.\n28\n\n\fSimilarly, it is natural to ask for analogues of the auxiliary short exact sequences (5.11) and\n(5.12). For the purposes of intersection theory, however, we need only the resulting Chern\npolynomial identity\nct (\u039e)k = ct (\u039e(\u2212(k \u2212 1)Q)ct (\u039e(Q))k\u22121 ,\n(5.15)\nwhich holds irrespective of the genus of C.\nIt now follows by the same argument used in the case of rational curves that\nct (Nfe[k] ) = c\u03b3 * ct (\u00ca)m+1 * ct (\u00ca \u2297 O(\u2212Hk ))k\u2212m\u22121 * (1 \u2212 Hk t)k+1\u22122g\u2212(\u03b3+1)m .\nwhere c\u03b3 is a contribution arising from \u03b3. For k = 1, c\u03b3 = 1. When k = 2, a straightforward\ncalculation using (5.9), (5.14), (5.15), and the splitting principle yields c\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3t)n+1 .\nMore generally, we have c\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3t)(k\u22121)(n+1) , from which we deduce the following result,\nvalid for embedded curves of positive genus.\nTheorem 4. For all k \u2265 1,\nct (Nfe[k] ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3t)(k\u22121)(n+1) * ct (\u00ca)m+1 * ct (\u00ca \u2297 O(\u2212Hk ))k\u2212m\u22121 * (1 \u2212 Hk t)k+1\u22122g\u2212(\u03b3+1)m .\n(5.16)\nExtending the cycle-theoretic method to one-parameter families of curves. A nice\nproject would be to generalize the results described above to the setting of one-parameter\nfamilies of curves. A potential application would be a proof of Conjecture 3, by applying a\ngeneralization of (5.16) and its consequences to a suitably chosen collection (varying with\nthe incidence parameter d) of non-isotrivial families of smooth curves. Note that the fibers\nof such a family will necessarily be of positive genus; otherwise the Hodge class \u03b3 will\nevaluate to zero along along the family. On the other hand, we may suppose that s, the\ndimension of the ambient projective space, remains fixed as d increases; this is a key feature\nof the cycle-theoretic method. A final point is that when r = 1, the classes of the Schubert\nmonomials that appear in the calculation of ce (F) are each point classes, i.e., of degree 1\n[23, Lemme 1]. (The Chern classes of the tautological quotient bundle on the Grassmannian\nare special Schubert cycles, which explains their appearance here.) This is an important\nparticularity of the r = 1 case, which we expect continues to hold in the relative setting.\n\n6\n\ns\nSecant plane divisors on Gm\nand on Mg\n\nThus far, we have seen how to determine the coefficients P\u03b1 , P\u03b2 , P\u03b3 , and P\u03b40 of secant\ns . For the sake of calculation, we have assumed\nplane divisors on the space of linear series Gm\n\u03c1 = 0; whenever this is the case, every secant plane divisor pushes forward to a divisor on\nMg .

Moreover, in\nthat the classes of the corresponding secant plane divisors on Gm\nlight of the calculation carried out for the first test family in Section 2, the desired nonvanishing property will follow from showing that the tautological coefficient Pc = Pc (d, g, m)\nis nonzero for every specialization\n\ng = a(s + 1) = 2ad, and m = (a + 1)s = (2d \u2212 1)(a + 1)\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere a and d are positive integers, a \u2265 2. (Note that the equations (6.8) encode the fact\nthat \u03c1 = 0. The possibility that a = 1 is precluded because in that case the corresponding\n2d\u22121 are canonical, and do not determine a divisor in G 2d\u22121 , essentially because every\nseries gm\nm\ncanonical curve that admits a (d \u2212 2)-secant plane admits a one-parameter family of such\nplanes.)
