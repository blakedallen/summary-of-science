INTRODUCTION\n\nThe \"greybody factor\" \u0393l (\u03c9) is an important quantity to understand the absorption\nand emission phenomena of a black hole. It is this factor which makes a black hole to\nbe different from a black body. The physical origin of this factor is an effective potential\nbarrier generated by a black hole spacetime. For example, the potential for the massless\nscalar generated by the 4d Schwarzschild spacetime is\nrH\nVeff (r\u2217 ) = 1 \u2212\nr\n\u0012\n\nrH l(l + 1)\n+\nr3\nr2\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhen the wave equation is expressed in terms of the \"tortoise\" coordinate r\u2217 = r +\nrH ln(r/rH \u2212 1), where rH is an horizon radius and l is an angular momentum of the scalar.\nThis potential generally backscatters a part of the outgoing radiation quantum machanically,\nwhich results in the frequency-dependent greybody factor \u0393l (\u03c9). This factor , therefore, appears in the black hole's thermal radiation formula\ndH X \u0393l (\u03c9) (2l + 1)\u03c9\n=\n\u03c9/TBH \u2212 1\nd\u03c9\n\u03c0\nl e\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere TBH is an Hawking temperature. Eq.(1.2) shows how the greybody factor and the\nPlanck factor play important roles in the emission rate of energy.\nIn addition to the radiation formula (1.2) the factor \u0393l (\u03c9) is important to compute the\npartial absorption cross section \u03c3l (\u03c9) of the black hole. The explicit relation1 between \u03c3l (\u03c9)\nand \u0393l (\u03c9) for the 4d massive scalar is\n\u03c3l (\u03c9) =\nand v =\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c92v2\n\n(2l + 1)\u0393l (\u03c9)\n\n(1.3)\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 m2 /\u03c9 2 and m is particle's mass. Thus one can compute \u03c3l from \u0393l straight-\n\nforwardly or vice versa.\nMany computational techniques for calculation of the absorption cross section in the\nvarious 4d black hole were developed long ago [1\u20137]. The main streams of this procedure\n\n1 The\n\nrelation between \u03c3l (\u03c9) and \u0393l (\u03c9) in higher dimensions is given in Eq.(4.23).\n\n3\n\n\fare to derive the solutions of the given wave equation in the near-horizon and asymptotic\nregimes separately and to match them in the appropriate intermediate place. Following\nthis procedure Unruh [6] computed the low energy absorption cross section for the massive\nscalar and Dirac fermion in the 4d Schwarzschild background. It is instructive to introduce\nan explicit expression of Ref. [6] for the massive scalar:\n(\u03c3l )unruh =\nTl =\n\n\u03c0\nk2 v2\n\n(2l + 1)Tl\n\n(1.4)\n\uf8ee\n\nl\nY\n\u03c0(l!)4 22l+2 (1 + v 2 )k 2l+3 v 2l\nk(1 + v 2 )\n\uf8f0s2 +\n(2l!)4 (2l + 1)2 [1 \u2212 exp {\u2212\u03c0k(1 + v 2 )/v}] s=1\n2v\n\n!2 \uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb.\n\nThe most interesting one Eq.(1.4) suggests is the fact that the low-energy absorption\ncross section for S-wave is equal to the horizon area in the massless limit. This is an\nuniversal property for the minimally coupled massless scalar. This universality indicates\nthat the low-energy cross section encodes information on the near-horizon structure of black\nhole. Another interesting result of Ref. [6] is the fact that the low-energy absorption cross\nsection for Dirac fermion with mass \u03bc is exactly 1/8 of that for scalar with mass m if \u03bc = m.\nIt is still unclear at least for us the physical origin of this ratio factor.\nThe universality is re-examined in the arbitrary dimensional spherically symmetric black\nhole [8]. Ref. [8] has shown that the low-energy absorption cross sections for scalar is equal to\nthe horizon area while that for spin-1/2 particle is an area measured in a flat spatial metric\nconformally related to the true metric. The universality for the minimally coupled massless\nscalar is extended to the p-brane-like objects [9] and its generalization to the massive scalar\nis discussed recently [10\u201312]. In particular, it is shown in Ref. [11] that the mass-dependence\nof the absorption cross section is very sensitive to the near-horizon structure of spacetime.\nThe computation of the low-energy absorption cross section is also important subject in\nthe context of string theories and brane-world scenario. In string theories the black hole is\neffectively represented by a collective states [13] and the relevant low energy excitations of\nthis effective description are the right- and left-moving modes of the string. The computation\nof the low-energy absorption cross section with this picture suggests that the effective string\ntheory for the black hole is \"heterotic\", i.e. the right-moving sector has both fermionic and\n4\n\n\fbosonic degrees of freedom, while the left-moving sector has only bosonic degree of freedom\n[14,15].\nIn the context of the brane-world scenario the most remarkable fact is that the fundamental Planck mass can be low as a TeV scale. This TeV-scale gravity is realized by making\nuse of the large extra dimensions [16,17] or warped extra dimensions [18]. One of the striking\nconsequences arising due to the TeV-scale gravity is that the future high-energy colliders\nsuch as the CERN Large Hadron Collider can be a black hole factory [19\u201321]. If the black\nholes can be really produced in the future collider, one can examine the quantum gravity\neffects of black hole in the laboratory such as Hawking radiation and/or information loss\nproblem [22,23]. Thus, it is important to investigate the absorption and emission problems\nin this context. Recently works along this direction were done [24\u201326]. In Ref. [24] the\nlow-energy absorption problems for massless bulk and brane-localized scalar are examined.\nIn Ref. [25] same problems for brane-localized massless particle with spin 1/2 and 1 are\nexamined. The absorption and emission problems for the brane-localized particles in the\nfull range of energy are numerically studied in Ref. [26].\nIn this paper we would like to extend Ref. [24,25] by considering the massive spin-0 and\nspin-1/2 particles in the (4 + n)-dimensional Schwarzschild background. Although the spin\ncan be introduced in the curved spacetime with ease by making use of the Newman-Penrose\nformalism [27], we will introduce it in the more traditional Dirac form. In section II we\nwill compute the low-energy absorption cross section for the brane-localized massive scalar.\nIt is shown in this section that our final result for the low-energy absorption cross section\nhas a correct massless limit. However, the 4d limit of it is not exactly same with Eq.(1.4),\nbut coincides with the low-energy expansion of Eq.(1.4). The reason for this is explained in\nthe appendix. In section III the low-energy absorption cross section for the massive Dirac\nfermion is computed by solving Dirac equation. The final form of the low-energy absorption\ncross section \u03c3j (\u03c9), where j is a total angular momentum, is just sum of two contributions\nfrom orbital angular momenta l = j \u00b1 1/2, i.e. \u03c3j (\u03c9) = \u03c3j,l=j+1/2(\u03c9) + \u03c3j,l=j\u22121/2(\u03c9). While\nthe introduction of spin via usual Newman-Penrose formalism generally does not allow to\n5\n\n\fcompute each contribution, our introduction of spin enables us to compute \u03c3j,l=j+1/2(\u03c9) and\n\u03c3j,l=j\u22121/2(\u03c9) separately. It is shown in this section that the contribution from lower l-state is\nlarger than that from higher l-state in the massive case. However, these two contributions to\n\u03c3j (\u03c9) are exactly same in the massless limit. It is also shown that the ratio of the absorption\ncross section for massive scalar and massive Dirac fermion is 2(n\u22123)/(n+1) , which gives a factor\n1/8 when n = 0 as Unruh found. In section IV the low-energy absorption cross section for\nbulk scalar is computed. It is shown that the massless and S-wave limit of our result for\nthe absorption cross section is same with the area of the horizon hypersurface. Thus, the\nuniversality for S-wave is preserved in the higher-dimensional theories. In section V a brief\nconclusion is given.\n\nII. LOW-ENERGY ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION FOR BRANE-LOCALIZED\nSCALAR\n\nThe various higher-dimensional black hole solutions of the Einstein equation were discussed in detail in Ref. [28]. The explicit expression of the (4+n)-dimensional Schwarzschild\nsolution in terms of the usual Schwarzschild coordinates is in the following:\nds2 = \u2212h(r)dt2 + h(r)\u22121 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92n+2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\nh(r) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nrH\nr\n\n\u0013n+1\n\n(2.2)\n\nand the angular part is given by\nd\u03a92n+2\n\n=\n\n2\nd\u03b8n+1\n\n2\n\n+ sin \u03b8n+1\n\nd\u03b8n2\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+ sin \u03b8n * * * + sin \u03b82\n\n\u0010\n\nd\u03b812\n\n2\n\n+ sin \u03b81 d\u03c6\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n***\n\n\u0013!\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe horizon radius rH is related to the black hole mass M as following:\nn+1\nrH\n=\n\n8\u0393\n\n\u0010\n\nn+3\n2\n\n(n + 2)\u03c0\n\n\u0011\n\nn+1\n2\n\nM\nM\u2217n+2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere M\u2217 = G\u22121/(n+2) is a (4 + n)-dimensional Planck mass and G is a Newton constant.\n6\n\n\fSince we are interested in the scalar localized on the brane in this section, we assume\nthe scalar field \u03a6 is a function of only t, r, \u03b81 , and \u03c6. Thus, letting \u03a6 = e\u2212i\u03c9t R\u03c9l (r)Yl (\u03b81 , \u03c6)\nyields a following radial equation\n\"\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n(\n\nh(r) d\ndR\nl(l + 1)\nh(r)r 2\n+ \u03c9 2 \u2212 h(r) m2 +\n2\nr dr\ndr\nr2\n\n)#\n\nR = 0.\n\n(2.5)\n\nFor the quantum-mechanical interpretation we can change Eq.(2.5) into the following\nSchr\u00f6dinger-like equation\n\u2212\n\n1 d2 \u03c8l\n+ Vef f (r\u2217 )\u03c8l = \u03c9 2 v 2 \u03c8l\n2Mef f dr\u22172\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere\nn\n\nR = r 2 \u03c8l ,\n\nr\u2217 = rH ln h\n\n(2.7)\n\n2n+4\n\n\u22121\n2\nn+1\nMef\nf = 2(n + 1) (1 \u2212 h)\n\nVef f (r\u2217 ) = h\n\nl(l + 1) \u2212\n\nn\n2\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(n + 1) \u2212 n2 h\n\nr2\n\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 h)m2 .\n\nUnlike the usual 4d black hole case the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation (2.6) involves not only\nthe effective potential but also the effective position-dependent mass. Thus, it seems to be\ndifficult to get a direct quantum-mechanical interpretation from (2.6). However, one can\nroughly estimate the effect of extra dimension in the absorption cross section. For simplicity\nlet us consider the massless limit. The effective potential as a function of r\u2217 is plotted in\nFig. 1 at fixed l. Fig. 1 indicates that the potential barrier height seems to increase with\nincreasing the number of extra dimensions. Since the greybody factor usually decreases\nwhen potential barrier becomes higher and the absorption cross section is proportional to\nthis factor, one can conjecture that the existence of the extra dimensions may reduces the\nabsorption cross section, which explains Fig. 1 of Ref. [26]. The detailed analysis of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger-like equation (2.6) will be discussed elsewhere.\nIn Ref. [6] Unruh derived the low-energy absorption cross section by solving the wave\nequation, i.e. the corresponding equation of Eq.(2.5) in 4d Schwarzschild black hole, in\n\n7\n\n\fthe near-horizon, asymptotic and intermediate regions separately and matching the nearhorizon and asymptotic solutions via the solution in the intermediate region. One may\nfollow this procedure, but it seems to be impossible unlike 4d case to derive a solution in\nthe intermediate region analytically. Thus, we adopt an alternative method introduced by\nMaldacena and Strominger in Ref. [14]. As will be shown in the next section, however,\nthis alternative method does not work when we discuss the absorption problem for Dirac\nfermion. In that case we will adopt the Unruh's original method.\nChanging a variable makes Eq.(2.5) to be\nd2 R\n2n + 1\n1\n(mr)2 + l(l + 1)\ndR\n(\u03c9r)2\nR = 0.

Thus\nour result (2.18) recovers not only the massless limit but also 4d limit.\nAt this stage one may question why our 4d limit is not exactly Eq.(1.4) but low-energy\nexpansion of it. In fact, Unruh derived Eq.(1.4) by expressing the asymptotic solution in\nterms of the Coulomb wave functions. The multiplicative factor and exponential factor\nin Eq.(1.4) are results of these Coulomb wave functions. In Appendix, however, we will\nshow that the expression of asymptotic solution in terms of the Coulomb wave functions\nis impossible except n = 0. This is why the 4d limit of our result gives the low-energy\nexpansion of Eq.(1.4).\n\nIII. LOW-ENERGY ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION FOR DIRAC FERMION\n\nIn this section we will compute the low-energy absorption cross section for the massive\nDirac fermion in the Schwarzschild background defined on the bulk. As commented earlier,\nspin of the particle can be introduced more conveniently by exploiting the Newman-Penrose\nformalism. However, it is more straightforward to introduce it in the traditional Dirac form,\nwhich we will follow in this section. As will be shown shortly, furthermore, our introduction\nof spin enables us to compute each contribution to the low-energy partial absorption cross\nsection. The usual Newman-Penrose formalism does not provide this information. It usually\ngives the total sum of it. Thus, we can determine which contribution is dominant.\nLet us start with Dirac equation\n10\n\n\f[\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03bc ) + \u03bc] \u03c8 = 0\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is a mass of the fermion and \u0393\u03bc is a spin-affine connection. Since we are interested\nin the Dirac fermion localized on the brane, we assume \u03c8 is function of t, r, \u03b8 = \u03b81 and \u03c6.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe gamma matrices in this background can be easily chosen as \u03b3 t = \u03b3 0 / h, \u03b3 r = h\u03b3 3 ,\n\u03b3 \u03b8 = \u03b3 1 /r, and \u03b3 \u03c6 = \u03b3 2 /r sin \u03b8 where \u03b3 i are the ordinary flat-space Dirac matrices defined\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b3 0 = \u2212i \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 0 \uf8f7\n0 \u22121\n\nand \u03c3 i are usual Pauli matrices.\n\n\u03b3 i = \u2212i \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\ni\n\n0\n\u2212\u03c3\n\ni\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03c3 \uf8f7\n0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe spin-affine connection in the (4 + n)-dimensional Schwarzschild background can be\nstraightforwardly computed with use of the affine connections and the results are\n(1 + n)(1 \u2212 h) 3 0\n\u0393t = \u2212\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u0393r = 0\n4r\n\u221a\n\u221a\nh 3 1\nh\n1\n\u0393\u03b8 =\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u0393\u03c6 =\nsin \u03b8\u03b3 3 \u03b3 2 + cos \u03b8\u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nThen, Dirac operator \u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03bc ) + \u03bc reduces to\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03bc ) + \u03bc = \u2212i \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\nwhere\n\n\u0124 =\n\n\u221a\n\nh\u03c3 3 Dr +\n\n\u221a1 \u2202t\nh\n\n+ i\u03bc\n\n\u2212\u0124\n\n\u0124\n\u2212 \u221a1h \u2202t + i\u03bc\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03c31\n\u03c32\nD\u03b8 +\n\u2202\u03c6\nr\nr sin \u03b8\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nand\n1 (n + 1)(1 \u2212 h)\n+\nr\n4hr\ncot \u03b8\n.\nD\u03b8 = \u2202\u03b8 +\n2\nDr = \u2202r +\n\n(3.6)\n\nIn order to perform the separation of variables we take an following ansatz\n\u03c8=\n\n\uf8eb\n\ne\u2212i\u01ebt \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nrh\n\n1\n4\n\n\uf8ed\n\nG(r)\u0398\u0302(\u03b8, \u03c6)\n3\n\n\u2212iF (r)\u03c3 \u0398\u0302(\u03b8, \u03c6)\n11\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fwhere \u0398\u0302(\u03b8, \u03c6) is angle-dependent two-component spinor.

If one introduces a spin by NewmanPenrose formalism, only the greybody factor for each j-level can be calculated, which is just\nsum of \u0393j,k>0(\u01eb) and \u0393j,k<0(\u01eb). Since, however, we introduced a spin by usual Dirac form,\nwe are able to calculate \u0393j,k>0(\u01eb) and \u0393j,k<0(\u01eb) individually, where the former corresponds\nto l = j + 1/2 and the latter to l = j \u2212 1/2. Thus we can determine which contribution\nof angular momentum quantum number is dominant. If, for example, j is fixed, there are\ncontribution to the greybody factor from l = j + 1/2 (or k = l) and l = j \u2212 1/2 (or\nk = \u2212l \u2212 1). Then Eq.(3.37) and (3.38) indicate\n\u0393j,k=j+ 1\n2\n\n\u0393j,k=\u2212j\u2212 1\n2\n\n=\n\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\u22641\n1+\u03bb\n\n(3.39)\n\nThus the contribution from l = j \u2212 1/2 to the greybody factor is larger than that from\nl = j + 1/2. However, in the massless limit two contributions are exactly same.\nThe absorption cross section for fixed j is given by\n\u0011\n\u03c0(2j + 1) \u0010\n1 (\u01eb)\n1 (\u01eb) + \u0393\n\u0393\nk=\u2212j\u2212 2\nk=j+ 2\n2\u01eb2 v 2\n4j+2\n\u03c0(2j + 1) (2\u03c0)2\u2212 n+1\n=\n(\u01ebvrH )2j+1 .\n2\n3\n2j\n2\n\u01ebv\n2 \u0393 (j + 1)\n\n\u03c3j (\u01eb) =\n\n16\n\n(3.40)\n\n\fNow, let us consider the limiting cases. In the massless limit Eq.(3.40) shows\n4j+2\n\n\u03c3jm=0 (\u01eb)\n\n\u03c0(2j + 1) (2\u03c0)2\u2212 n+1\n=\n(\u01ebrH )2j+1\n\u01eb2\n22j \u03932 (j + 1)\n\n(3.41)\n\nwhich exactly coincides with Eq.(45) of Ref. [25].\nNext, let us consider the case of the lowest angular momentum quantum number, i.e.\nj = 1/2. In this case the absorption cross section becomes\n\u03c3j= 1 (\u01eb) =\n2\n\n\u03c0 3n\u22121 2\n2 n+1 rH .\nv\n\n(3.42)\n\nSince Eq.(2.19) indicates the low-energy absorption cross section for S-wave is\n\u03c3l=0 =\n\n2\n4\u03c0rH\n,\nv\n\n(3.43)\n\nthe ratio between \u03c3j=1/2 and \u03c3l=0 when \u01eb = \u03c9 and \u03bc = m becomes\n\u03c3j= 1\n2\n\n\u03c3l=0\n\nn\u22123\n\n= 2 n+1 .\n\n(3.44)\n\nThus we get \u03c3j=1/2 /\u03c3l=0 = 1/8 when n = 0, which Unruh found in his seminar paper in Ref.\n[6]. Thus, our result Eq.(3.44) is a generalized ratio between the low-energy absorption cross\nsections for spin-1/2 and scalar particles in the higher-dimensional brane-world theories. In\nconclusion, our result (3.40) correctly reproduces the n = 0 limit as well as 4d limit.\n\nIV. LOW-ENERGY ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION FOR BULK SCALAR\n\nIn this section we will discuss on the low-energy absorption problem for the minimallycoupled massive scalar which lives in the bulk. Thus, we should assume the scalar field\n\u03a6 is function of all bulk coordimates.

The 4d limit of \u03c3l is easily computed by letting n = 0, which is exactly\nsame with Eq.(2.20). Also the massless limit of Eq.(4.23) exactly coincides with Eq.(5.4) of\nRef. [26]. Thus our result has correct 4d and massless limits.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe low-energy absorption cross section for the brane-localized massive scalar, branelocalized massive Dirac fermion, and massive bulk scalar are explicitly computed when the\nbackground is (4 + n)-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime.\nFor the case of the brane-localized massive scalar our result (2.18) has a correct massless\nlimit. But the 4d limit of Eq.(2.18) is not exactly same with the Unruh's 4d result (1.4), but\ncoincides with its low-energy expansion. The reason for this is clarified in the appendix.\n21\n\n\fFor the case of the brane-localized Dirac fermion we introduced the particle's spin using the traditional Dirac form instead of the Newman-Penrose formalism. Thus, we should\ncompute the spin-affine connections and separate the Dirac equation to derive a radial equation, which were performed explicitly in section III. Our introduction of spin enables us to\ncompute the contributions to the low-energy absorption cross section from the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l. Since, for spin-1/2 particle, total angular momentum\nquantum number j is contributed from l = j \u00b1 1/2, the ratio of \u03c3j,l=j+1/2 and \u03c3j,l=j\u22121/2 is\ngiven in Eq.(3.39). This equation indicates that the contribution from lower orbital angular\nmomentum is larger than that from higher orbital angular momentum in the massive case.\nHowever, two contributions are exactly same in the massless limit. The ratio of \u03c3j=1/2 and\nthe low-energy absorption cross section for S-wave massive scalar turns out to be dependent\non the number of extra dimensions as 2(n\u22123)/(n+1) . Thus, we can reproduce the ratio factor\n1/8 at n = 0 which was shown by Unruh in Ref. [6]. Of course, our result has a correct\nmassless limit.\nFor the case of the bulk scalar our result (4.23) for the low-energy absorption cross\nsection is shown to have correct massless and 4d limits. Especially, the cross section for\nthe massless S-wave is exactly same with the area of the horizon hypersurface, which is a\nhigher-dimensional generalization of the universality for S-wave.\nThe extensions of our paper can be pursued in the several different directions. Firstly,\none may consider the low-energy absorption cross section for a massive particle which has\nan arbitrary spin. In this case we should derive a radial master equation using the NewmanPenrose formalism. Then, it may be possible to examine the effect of spin in the absorption\nand emission problems of the higher-dimensional theories. Similar approach can be applied\nto generalize Ref. [15]. Then we may understand the effect of particle's mass in the stringy\ndescription of black hole.\nSince the matching method between the near-horizon and asymptotic solutions introduced in Ref. [10,11] gives an information on the high-energy absorption cross section, it\nmay be possible to extend our paper to the extremely high-energy domain. It is of inter22\n\n\fest to check the effect of the extra dimensions in the high-energy absorption and emission\nproblems.\nAnother extension of the present paper is to examine the absorption and emission problems in the entire range of energy. This can be performed numerically by following our\nrecent paper [12]. In Ref. [12] the absorption cross section for massive S-wave in the 4d\nblack hole background exhibits a pecular behavior, i.e. decreasing behavior with increasing\nenergy in the extremely low-energy regime. This behavior, as a result, breaks the universality for S-wave. It is interesting to check whether or not similar behavior exists in the\nhigher-dimensional theories.\nThe most interesting one seems to be to understand the physical origin of the ratio factor\n2(n\u22123)/(n+1) . Since the absorption cross section for the brane-localized massless S-wave is fixed\n2\nat 4\u03c0rH\n, this ratio factor indicates that the absorption cross section for the Dirac fermion\n\nincreases when the extra dimensions exist. Especially, for the infinite extra dimensions the\ncross section for fermion becomes maximum, twice the cross section for scalar. Thus this\nratio factor can be important to determine the number of the extra dimensions in the future\ncollider.\n\nAcknowledgement: This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant\n(KRF-2003-015-C00109).\n\n23\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] S.

Since the barrier height increases with increasing the number of extra\ndimensions, this figure indicates the existence of the extra dimensions may decrease the absorption\ncross section for the massive scalar.\n\n28\n\n\fVeff\n\nn=4\n9\n\nn=2\n6\nn=0\n\n3\n\n0\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\nFig. 1\n\n29\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nr*\n\n\f"}
