The topic of this lecture is the \"tropical approach\" in mathematics, which has gotten a lot of attention recently in combinatorics, algebraic\ngeometry and related fields. It offers an an elementary introduction to this\nsubject, touching upon Arithmetic, Polynomials, Curves, Phylogenetics and\nLinear Spaces. Each section ends with a suggestion for further research. The\nbibliography contains numerous references for further reading in this field.\nThe adjective \"tropical\" was coined by French mathematicians, including\nJean-Eric Pin [19], in the honor of their Brazilian colleague Imre Simon [23],\nwho was one of the pioneers in min-plus algebra. There is no deeper meaning\nin the adjective \"tropical\". It simply stands for the French view of Brazil.\n\n1\n\nArithmetic\n\nOur basic object of study is the tropical semiring (R \u222a {\u221e}, \u2295, \u2299). As a\nset this is just the real numbers R, together with an extra element \u221e which\nrepresents infinity. However, we redefine the basic arithmetic operations of\naddition and multiplication of real numbers as follows:\nx \u2295 y := min(x, y)\n\nand\n\nx \u2299 y := x + y.\n\nIn words, the tropical sum of two numbers is their minimum, and the tropical\nproduct of two numbers is their sum. Here are some examples of how to do\nSupported as a Clay Mathematics Institute Senior Scholar at the IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute, July 2004\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\farithmetic in this strange number system. The tropical sum of 3 and 7 is 3.\nThe tropical product of 3 and 7 equals 10. We write this as follows:\n3\u22957 = 3\n\n3 \u2299 7 = 10.\n\nand\n\nMany of the familar axioms of arithmetic remain valid in tropical mathematics. For instance, both addition and multiplication are commutative:\nx\u2295y = y \u2295x\n\nand\n\nx \u2299 y = y \u2299 x.\n\nThe distributive law holds for tropical addition and tropical multiplication:\nx \u2299 (y \u2295 z)\n\nx \u2299 y \u2295 x \u2299 z.\n\n=\n\nHere is a numerical example to show distributivity:\n3 \u2299 (7 \u2295 11) = 3 \u2299 7 = 10,\n3 \u2299 7 \u2295 3 \u2299 11 = 10 \u2295 14 = 10.\nBoth arithmetic operations have a neutral element. Infinity is the neutral\nelement for addition and zero is the neutral element for multiplication:\nx \u2295 \u221e = x\n\nx \u2299 0 = 0.\n\nand\n\nElementary school students tend to prefer tropical arithmetic because the\nmultiplication table is easier to memorize, and even long division becomes\neasy. Here are the tropical addition table and the tropical multiplication table:\n\u2295\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n3\n1\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n5\n5\n\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n6\n\n\u2299\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n2 3 4 5\n3 4 5 6\n4 5 6 7\n5 6 7 8\n6 7 8 9\n7 8 9 10\n8 9 10 11\n9 10 11 12\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\nBut watch out: tropical arithmetic is tricky when it comes to subtraction.\nThere is no x which we can call \"10 minus 3\" because the equation 3\u2295x = 10\nhas no solution x at all. To stay on safe ground, in this lecture, we shall\ncontent ourselves with using addition \u2295 and multiplication \u2299 only.\n2\n\n\fIt is extremely important to remember that \"0\u2032\u2032 is the multiplicatively\nneutral element. For instance, the tropical Pascal's triangle looks like this:\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n*** ***\n***\n***\n*** ***\nThe rows of Pascal's triangle are the coefficients appearing in the Binomial\nTheorem. For instance, the third row in the triangle represents the identity\n(x \u2295 y)3\n\n=\n=\n\n(x \u2295 y) \u2299 (x \u2295 y) \u2299 (x \u2295 y)\n0 \u2299 x3 \u2295 0 \u2299 x2 y \u2295 0 \u2299 xy 2 \u2295 0 \u2299 y 3.\n\nOf course, the zero coefficients can be dropped in this identity:\n(x \u2295 y)3\n\n=\n\nx3 \u2295 x2 y \u2295 xy 2 \u2295 y 3.\n\nMoreover, the Freshman's Dream holds for all powers in tropical arithmetic:\n(x \u2295 y)3\n\n=\n\nx3 \u2295 y 3 .\n\nThe validity of the three displayed identities is easily verified by noting that\nthe following equations hold in classical arithmetic for all x, y \u2208 R:\n3 * min{x, y}\n\n=\n\nmin{3x, 2x + y, x + 2y, 3y}\n\n=\n\nmin{3x, 3y}.\n\nResearch problem: The set of convex polyhedra in Rn can be made into\na semiring by taking \u2299 as \"Minkowski sum\" and \u2295 as \"convex hull of the\nunion\". A natural subalgebra is the set of all polyhedra which have a fixed\nrecession cone C. If n = 1 and C = R\u22650 then we get the tropical semiring. Develop linear algebra and algebraic geometry over these semirings, and\nimplement efficient software for doing arithmetic with polyhedra when n \u2264 4.\n\n2\n\nPolynomials\n\nLet x1 , x2 , . . . , xn be variables which represent elements in the tropical semiring (R \u222a {\u221e}, \u2295, \u2299). A monomial is any product of these variables, where\n3\n\n\frepetition is allowed. (Technical note: we allow negative integer exponents.)\nBy commutativity, we can sort the product and write monomials in the usual\nnotation, with the variables raised to exponents:\nx2 \u2299 x1 \u2299 x3 \u2299 x1 \u2299 x4 \u2299 x2 \u2299 x3 \u2299 x2\n\n=\n\nx21 x32 x23 x4 .\n\nA monomial represents a function from Rn to R. When evaluating this\nfunction in classical arithmetic, what we get is a linear function:\nx2 + x1 + x3 + x1 + x4 + x2 + x3 + x2\n\n=\n\n2x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + x4 .\n\nEvery linear function with integer coefficients arises in this manner.\nFact 1. Tropical monomials are the linear functions with integer coefficients.\nA tropical polynomial is a finite linear combination of tropical monomials:\np(x1 , . . . , xn )\n\n=\n\na \u2299 xi11 xi22 * * * xinn \u2295 b \u2299 xj11 xj22 * * * xjnn \u2295 * * *\n\nHere the coefficients a, b, . . . are real numbers and the exponents i1 , j1 , . . . are\nintegers. Every tropical polynomial represents a function Rn \u2192 R. When\nevaluating this function in classical arithmetic, what we get is the minimum\nof a finite collection of linear functions, namely,\n\u0001\np(x1 , . . . , xn ) = min a + i1 x1 + * * * + in xn , b + j1 x1 + * * * + jn xn , . . .\nThis function p : Rn \u2192 R has the following three important properties:\n\u2022 p is continuous,\n\u2022 p is piecewise-linear, where the number of pieces is finite, and\n\u2022 p is concave, i.e., p( x+y\n) \u2265 21 (p(x) + p(y)) for all x, y \u2208 Rn .\n2\nIt is known that every function which satisfies these three properties can be\nrepresented as the minimum of a finite set of linear functions. We conclude:\nFact 2. The tropical polynomials in n variables x1 , . . . , xn are precisely the\npiecewise-linear concave functions on Rn with integer coefficients.\n\n4\n\n\fy\n\nb\u2212a c\u2212b d\u2212c\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: The graph of a cubic polynomial and its roots\nAs a first example consider the general cubic polynomial in one variable x,\np(x)\n\n=\n\na \u2299 x3 \u2295 b \u2299 x2 \u2295 c \u2299 x \u2295 d.\n\n(1)\n\nTo graph this function we draw four lines in the (x, y) plane: y = 3x + a,\ny = 2x + b, y = x + c and the horizontal line y = d. The value of p(x) is the\nsmallest y-value such that (x, y) is on one of these four lines, i.e., the graph\nof p(x) is the lower envelope of the lines. All four lines actually contribute if\nb \u2212 a \u2264 c \u2212 b \u2264 d \u2212 c.\n\n(2)\n\nThese three values of x are the breakpoints where p(x) fails to be linear, and\nthe cubic has a corresponding factorization into three linear factors:\np(x)\n\n=\n\na \u2299 (x \u2295 (b \u2212 a)) \u2299 (x \u2295 (c \u2212 b)) \u2299 (x \u2295 (d \u2212 c)).\n\n(3)\n\nSee Figure 1 for the graph and the roots of the cubic polynomial p(x).\nEvery tropical polynomial function can be written uniquely as a tropical\nproduct of tropical linear functions (i.e., the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nholds tropically). In this statement we must underline the word \"function\".\n5\n\n\fDistinct polynomials can represent the same function. We are not claiming\nthat every polynomial factors into linear functions. What we are claiming is\nthat every polynomial can be replaced by an equivalent polynomial, representing the same function, that can be factored into linear factors, e.g.,\nx2 \u2295 17 \u2299 x \u2295 2\n\n=\n\nx2 \u2295 1 \u2299 x \u2295 2\n\n=\n\n(x \u2295 1)2 .\n\nUnique factorization of polynomials no longer holds in two or more variables.\nHere the situation is more interesting. Understanding it is our next problem.\nResearch problem: The factorization of multivariate tropical polynomials\ninto irreducible tropical polynomials is not unique. Here is a simple example:\n(0 \u2299 x \u2295 0) \u2299 (0 \u2299 y \u2295 0) \u2299 (0 \u2299 x \u2299 y \u2295 0)\n= (0 \u2299 x \u2299 y \u2295 0 \u2299 x \u2295 0) \u2299 (0 \u2299 x \u2299 y \u2295 0 \u2299 y \u2295 0).\nDevelop an algorithm (with implementation and complexity analysis) for\ncomputing all the irreducible factorizations of a given tropical polynomial.\nGao and Lauder [12] have shown the importance of tropical factorization for\nthe problem of factoring multivariate polynomials in the classical sense.\n\n3\n\nCurves\n\nA tropical polynomial function p : Rn \u2192 R is given as the minimum of\na finite set of linear functions. We define the hypersurface H(p) to be the\nset of all points x \u2208 Rn at which this minimum is attained at least twice.\nEquivalently, a point x \u2208 Rn lies in H(p) if and only if p is not linear at x.\nFor example, if n = 1 and p is the cubic in (1) with the assumption (2), then\n\b\nH(p) =\nb \u2212 a, c \u2212 b, d \u2212 c .\nThus the hypersurface H(p) is the set of \"roots\" of the polynomial p(x).\nIn this section we consider the case of a polynomial in two variables:\nM\np(x, y) =\ncij \u2299 xi \u2299 y j .\n(i,j)\n\nFact 3. The tropical curve H(p) is a finite graph which is embedded in the\nplane R2 . It has both bounded and unbounded edges, all edge directions are\nrational, and this graph satisfies a zero tension condition around each node.\n6\n\n\fThe zero tension condition is the following geometric condition. Consider\nany node (x, y) of the graph and suppose it is the origin, i.e., (x, y) = (0, 0).\nThen the edges adjacent to this node lie on lines with rational slopes. On\neach such ray emanating from the origin consider the first non-zero lattice\nvector. Zero tension at (x, y) means that the sum of these vectors is zero.\nOur first example is a line in the plane. It is defined by a polynomial:\np(x, y)\n\n=\n\na\u2299x \u2295 b\u2299y \u2295 c\n\nwhere a, b, c \u2208 R.\n\nThe curve H(p) consists of all points (x, y) where the function\np : R2 \u2192 R ,\n\n(x, y) 7\u2192 min a + x, b + y, c\n\n\u0001\n\nis not linear. It consists of three half-rays emanating from the point (x, y) =\n(c \u2212 a, c \u2212 b) into northern, eastern and southwestern direction.\nHere is a general method for drawing a tropical curve H(p) in the plane.\nConsider any term \u03b3 \u2299 xi \u2299 y j appearing in the polynomial p. We represent\nthis term by the point (\u03b3, i, j) in R3 , and we compute the convex hull of\nthese points in R3 . Now project the lower envelope of that convex hull into\nthe plane under the map R3 \u2192 R2 , (\u03b3, i, j) 7\u2192 (i, j). The image is a planar\nconvex polygon together with a distinguished subdivision \u2206 into smaller\npolygons. The tropical curve H(p) is the dual graph to this subdivision.\nAs an example we consider the general quadratic polynomial\np(x, y)\n\n=\n\na \u2299 x2 \u2295 b \u2299 xy \u2295 c \u2299 y 2 \u2295 d \u2299 x \u2295 e \u2299 y \u2295 f.\n\nThen \u2206 is a subdivision of the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 2) and (2, 0).\nThe lattice points (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) are allowed to be used as vertices in\nthese subdivisions. Assuming that a, b, c, d, e, f \u2208 R are general solutions of\n2b \u2264 a + c , 2d \u2264 a + f , 2e \u2264 c + f,\nthe subdivision \u2206 consists of four triangles, three interior edges and six\nboundary edges. The curve H(p) has four vertices, three bounded edges and\nsix half-rays (two northern, two eastern and two southwestern). In Figure 2,\nH(p) is shown in bold, and the subdivision \u2206 is shown in thin lines.\nFact 4. Tropical curves intersect and interpolate like algebraic curves do.\n1. Two general lines meet in one point, a line and a quadric meet in two\npoints, two quadrics meet in four points, etc....\n7\n\n\fFigure 2: The subdivision \u2206 and the tropical curve\n2. Two general points lie on a unique line, five general points lie on a\nunique quadric, etc...\nFor a general discussion of B\u00e9zout's Theorem in tropical algebraic geometry, and for many pictures illustrating Fact 4, we refer to the article [20].\nResearch problem: Classify all combinatorial types of tropical curves in\n3-space of degree d. Such a curve is a finite embedded graph of the form\nC\n\n=\n\nH(p1 ) \u2229 H(p2 ) \u2229 * * * \u2229 H(pr )\n\n\u2282\n\nR3 ,\n\nwhere the pi are tropical polynomials, C has d unbounded parallel halfrays in\neach of the four coordinate directions, and all other edges of C are bounded.\n\n4\n\nPhylogenetics\n\nAn important problem in computational biology is to construct a phylogenetic\ntree from distance data involving n taxa. These taxa might be organisms or\ngenes, each represented by a DNA sequence. For an introduction to phylogenetics we recommend [11] and [21]. Here is an example, for n = 4, to\nillustrate how such data might arise. Consider an alignment of four genomes:\n8\n\n\fHuman:\nMouse:\nRat:\nChicken:\n\nACAAT GT CAT T AGCGAT . . .\nACGT T GT CAAT AGAGAT . . .\nACGT AGT CAT T ACACAT . . .\nGCACAGT CAGT AGAGCT . . .\n\nFrom such sequence data, computational biologists infer the distance between\nany two taxa. There are various algorithms for carrying out this inference.\nThey are based on statistical models of evolution. For our discussion, we\nmay think of the distance between any two strings as a refined version of the\nHamming distance (= the proportion of characters where they differ). In our\n(Human, Mouse, Rat, Chicken) example, the inferred distance matrix might\nbe the following symmetric 4 \u00d7 4-matrix:\nH M R C\nH 0 1.1 1.0 1.4\nM 1.1 0 0.3 1.3\nR 1.0 0.2 0 1.2\nC 1.4 1.3 1.2 0\nThe problem of phylogenetics is to construct a tree with edge lengths which\nrepresent this distance matrix, provided such a tree exists. In our example,\na tree does exist. It is depicted in Figure 3. The number next to the each\nedge is its length. The distance between two leaves in the tree is the sum\nof the lengths of the edges on the unique path between the two leaves. For\ninstance, the distance in this tree between \"Human\" and \"Mouse\" equals\n0.6 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1.1, which is the corresponding entry in the 4 \u00d7 4-matrix.\nIn general, considering n taxa, the distance between taxon i and taxon j is\na positive real number dij which has been determined by some bio-statistical\nmethod. So, what we are given is a real symmetric n \u00d7 n-matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 d12 d13 * * * d1n\n\uf8ec d12 0 d23 * * * d2n \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nD = \uf8ec d13 d23 0 * * * d3n \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ec ..\n..\n..\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ed .\n.\n.\n.\n. \uf8f8\nd1n d2n d3n * * * 0\nWe may assume that D is a metric, i.e., the triangle inequalities dik \u2264\ndij + djk hold for all i, j, k. This can be expressed by matrix multiplication:\n9\n\n\f0.4\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.6\n0.2\n\nHuman\n\n0.1\n\nMouse\n\nRat\n\nChicken\n\nFigure 3: A Phylogenetic Tree\nFact 5. The matrix D represents a metric if and only if D \u2299 D = D.\nWe say that D is a tree metric if there exists a tree T with n leaves, labeled\n1, 2, . . . , n, and a positive length for each edge of T , such that the distance\nfrom leaf i to leaf j equals dij for all i, j. Tree metrics occur naturally in\nbiology because they model an evolutionary process that led to the n taxa.\nMost metrics D are not tree metrics. If we are given a metric D that arises\nfrom some biological data then it is reasonable to assume that there exists\na tree metric DT which is close to D. Biologists use a variety of algorithms\n(e.g. \"neighbor joining\") to construct such a nearby tree T from the given\ndata D. In what follows we state a tropical characterization of tree metrics.\n\u0001 Let X = (Xij ) be a symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal whose\nn\ndistinct off-diagonal entries are unknowns. For each quadruple {i, j, k, l}\n2\n\u2282 {1, 2, . . . , n} we consider the following tropical polynomial of degree two:\npijkl\n\n=\n\nXij \u2299 Xkl \u2295 Xik \u2299 Xjl \u2295 Xil \u2299 Xjk .\n\n(4)\n\nThis polynomial is the tropical Grassmann-Pl\u00fccker relation. It defines a\n(n2 ) . The tropical Grassmannian is the\nhypersurface H(pijkl ) in\nthe\nspace\nR\n\u0001\nintersection of these n4 hypersurfaces. This is a polyhedral fan, denoted\n\\\nn\nGr2,n =\nH(pijkl )\n\u2282 R( 2 ) .\n1\u2264i<j<k<l\u2264n\n\n10\n\n\fFact 6. A metric D on {1, 2, . . . , n} is a tree metric if and only if its negative\nX = \u2212D is a point in the tropical Grassmannian Gr2,n .\nThe statement is a reformulation of the Four Point Condition in phylogenetics, which states that D is a tree metric if and only if, for all 1 \u2264 i <\nj < k < l \u2264 n, the maximum of the three numbers Dij + Dkl , Dik + Djl\nand Dil + Djk is attained at least twice. For X = \u2212D, this means that the\nminimum of the three numbers Xij +Xkl , Xik +Xjl and Xil +Xjk is attained\nat least twice, or, equivalently, X \u2208 H(pijkl ). The tropical Grassmannian\nGr2,n is also known as the space of phylogenetic trees [5]. The combinatorial\nstructure of this beautiful space is well-studied and well-understood.\nOur research suggestion for this section concerns a certain reembedding\nof the tropical Grassmannian Gr2,n into a higher-dimensional space.\nResearch problem: Let n \u2265 5 and consider a metric D on {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nThe triple weights of the metric D are defined as follows:\nDijk\n\n:=\n\nDij + Dik + Djk\n\n(1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 n).\n\nn\nn\nThis formula specifies a linear map \u03c8 : R( 2 ) \u2192 R( 3 ) . Our problem is to\ncharacterize the image \u03c8(Gr2,n ) of tree space Gr2,n under this linear map.\nThis problem arises from phylogenies of sequence alignments in genomics.\nFor such taxa, it can be more reliable statistically to estimate the triple\nweights Dijk rather than the pairwise distances Dij . Pachter and Speyer [18]\nshowed that tree metrics are uniquely determined by their triple weights, i.e.,\nthe map from Gr2,n onto \u03c8(Gr2,n ) is a bijection. Find a natural system of\nn\ntropical polynomials which define \u03c8(Gr2,n ) as a tropical subvariety of R( 3 ) .\n\n5\n\nLinear Spaces\n\nThis section is concerned with tropical linear spaces. Generalizing the notion\nof a line from Section 3, we define a tropical hyperplane to be a subset of Rn\nwhich has the form H(l), where l is a tropical linear form in n unknowns:\nl(x)\n\n=\n\na1 \u2299 xn \u2295 a2 \u2299 x2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 an \u2299 xn .\n\nHere a1 , . . . an are arbitrary real constants. Solving linear equations in tropical mathematics means computing the intersection of finitely many hyperplanes H(l). It is tempting to define tropical linear spaces simply as intersections of tropical hyperplanes. However, this would not be a good definition\n11\n\n\fbecause such arbitrary intersections are not always pure dimensional, and\nthey do not behave the way linear spaces do in classical geometry.\nA better notion of tropical linear space is derived by allowing only those\nintersections of hyperplanes which are \"sufficiently complete\". In what follows we offer a definition which is a direct generalization of our discussion in\nSection 4. The idea is that phylogenetic trees are lines in tropical projective\nspace, whose Pl\u00fccker coordinates Xij are the negated pairwise distances dij .\n\u0001\nn\nWe consider the nd -dimensional space R( d ) whose coordinates Xi1 ***id\nare indexed by d-element subsets {i1 , . . . , id } of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let S be any\n(d\u22122)-element subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} and let i, j, k and l be any four distinct\nindices in {1, . . . , n}\\S. The corresponding three-term Grassmann Pl\u00fccker\nrelation pS,ijkl is the following tropical polynomial of degree two:\npS,ijkl\n\n=\n\nXSij \u2299 XSkl \u2295 XSik \u2299 XSjl \u2295 XSil \u2299 XSjk .\n\n(5)\n\nWe define the three-term tropical Grassmannian to be the intersection\n\\\nn\nGrd.n =\nH(pS,ijkl) \u2282 R( d ) ,\nS,i,j,k,l\n\nwhere the intersection is over all S, i, j, k, l as above. Note that in the special\ncase d = 2 we have S = \u2205, the polynomial (5) is the four point condition in\n(4), and Grd,n is the space of trees which was discussed in Section 4.\nWe now fix an arbitrary point X = (Xi1 ***id ) in the three-term tropical\nGrassmannian Grd.n . For any (d + 1)-subset {j0 , j1 , . . . , jd } of {1, 2, . . . , n}\nwe consider the following tropical linear form in the variables x1 , . . . , xn :\nlX\nj0 j1 ***jd\n\n=\n\nd\nM\nr=0\n\nXj0 ***jbr ***jd \u2299 xr .\n\n(6)\n\nThe b means to omit jr . The tropical linear space associated with the point\nX is the following set:\n\\\n\u2282 Rn .\nLX =\nH(lX\nj0 j1 ***jn )\nHere the intersection is over all (d+1)-subsets {j0 , j1 , . . . , jd } of {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nThe tropical linear spaces are precisely the sets LX where X is any point\nn\nin Grd,n \u2282 R( d ) . The \"sufficient completeness\" referred to in the first paragraph of this section means that we need to solve linear equations using\n12\n\n\fCramer's rule, in all possible ways, in order for an intersection of hyperplanes to actually be a linear space. The definition of linear space given here\nis more inclusive than the one used in [10, 20, 24], where LX was required to\ncome from ordinary algebraic geometry over a field with a suitable valuation.\nFor example, a 3-dimensional tropical linear subspace of Rn (a.k.a. twodimensional\nplane in tropical projective (n \u2212 1)-space) is the intersection of\n\u0001\nn\ntropical hyperplanes, each of whose defining linear form has four terms:\n4\nlX\nj0 j1 j2 j3 = Xj0 j1 j2 \u2299 xj3 \u2295 Xj0 j1 j3 \u2299 xj2 \u2295 Xj0 j2 j3 \u2299 xj1 \u2295 Xj1 j2 j3 \u2299 xj0 .\nWe note that even the very special case when each coordinate of X is\neither 0 (the multiplicative unit) or \u221e (the additive unit) is really interesting.\nHere LX is a polyhedral fan known as the Bergman fan of a matroid [2, 25].\nTropical linear spaces have many of the properties of ordinary linear\nspaces. First, they are pure polyhedral complexes of the correct dimension:\nFact 7. Each maximal cell of the tropical linear space LX is d-dimensional.\nEvery tropical linear space LX determines its vector of tropical Pl\u00fccker\ncoordinates X uniquely up to tropical multiplication (= classical addition)\nby a common scalar. If L and L\u2032 are tropical linear spaces of dimensions d\nand d\u2032 with d + d\u2032 \u2265 n, then L and L\u2032 meet. It is not quite true that two\ntropical linear spaces intersect in a tropical linear space but it is almost true.\nIf L and L\u2032 are tropical linear spaces of dimensions d and d\u2032 with d + d\u2032 \u2265 n\nand v is a generic small vector then L \u2229 (L\u2032 + v) is a tropical linear space\nof dimension d + d\u2032 \u2212 n. Following [20], it makes sense to define the stable\nintersection of L and L\u2032 by taking the limit of L \u2229 (L\u2032 + v) as v goes to zero,\nand this limit will again be a tropical linear space of dimension d + d\u2032 \u2212 n.\nResearch Problem: It is not true that a d-dimensional tropical linear space\ncan always be written as the\n\u0001 intersection of n \u2212 d tropical hyperplanes. The\nn\ndefinition shows that d+1 hyperplanes are always enough. What is the\nminimum number of tropical hyperplanes needed to cut out any tropical\nlinear space of dimension d in n-space? Are n hyperplanes always enough?\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
