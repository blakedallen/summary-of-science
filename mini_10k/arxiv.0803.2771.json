We prove the Hausdorff property of the N\u00e9ron modle of the family of\nintermediate Jacobians which is recently defined by Green, Griffiths and Kerr assuming\nthat the divisor at infinity is smooth. Using their result, this implies in this case the\nanalyticity of the closure of the zero locus of an admissible normal function. The last\nassertion is also obtained by Brosnan and Pearlstein generalizing their method in the\ncurve case.\n\nIntroduction\nLet H be a polarizable variation of Z-Hodge structure of weight w < 0 on a complex\nmanifold S. Let JS (H) denote the family of intermediate Jacobians over S. A normal\nfunction is a holomorphic section of JS (H) satisfying the Griffiths transversality, and\ncorresponds by a well-known theorem of Carlson [3] to an extension class of the trivial\nvariation ZS by H in the abelian category of mixed Z-Hodge structures [6]. A normal\nfunction is called admissible [10] if the corresponding extension is an admissible variation\nof mixed Hodge structure in the sense of [9], [13]. This condition corresponds to certain\nconditions on the local monodromy and the logarithmic growth at infinity of the normal\nfunction, see [8]. By M. Green and P. Griffiths (see [1]) we have the following\nConjecture 1. The zero locus of an admissible normal function is algebraic if S is algebraic\n(where w = \u22121).\nLet S\u0304 be a smooth partial compactification of S such that D := S\u0304 \\ S is a divisor with\nnormal crossings. Then Conjecture 1 is easily reduced to\nConjecture 2. The closure of the zero locus of an admissible normal function in S\u0304 is\nanalytic (where w = \u22121).\nIn the curve case these conjectures were solved by P. Brosnan and G. Pearlstein [1]\nwhere the assertion was equivalent to the discreteness of the closure. In this paper we\nprove\nTheorem 1. Assume D is smooth. If w = \u22121, then Conjecture 2 is true, and moreover,\nthe closure of the zero locus is contained in S if the local cohomological invariant of the\nadmissible normal function is nonzero and the local monodromy of H is unipotent. The\nDate : Apr. 8, 2009, v.4\n\n1\n\n\fsame assertions hold for w < \u22121 if we assume further that the local cohomological invariant\nof the admissible normal function is torsion.\nWe are informed that the first assertion is also obtained by P. Brosnan and G. Pearlstein generalizing their method in [1], see [2]. From Theorem 1 we can deduce\nCorollary 1. Assume S admits a smooth compactification S\u0304 such that D = S\u0304 \\ S is\nsmooth. Then Conjecture 1 holds where w = \u22121. For w < \u22121 it holds if furthermore the\nlocal cohomological invariant of the admissible normal function is torsion.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is reduced to the case where the local monodromy is unipotent.\nLet JS\u0304Z (H) denote the Zucker extension of JS (H), see [14]. Let JS\u0304GGK (H)0 denote the\nsubspace of JS\u0304Z (H)|D defined by the quotient of the monodromy invariant subspace. This\nis the identify component of the N\u00e9ron model JS\u0304GGK (H) which is recently defined by\nM. Green, P. Griffiths and M. Kerr, see [8]. Using their result, Theorem 1 is then reduced\nto the following\nTheorem 2. The Zucker extension JS\u0304Z (H) has a structure of a complex Lie group over\nS\u0304, and it is a Hausdorff topological space on a neighborhood of JS\u0304GGK (H)0 .\nThis is essentially equivalent to Corollary (2.7) which is deduced from Theorem (2.1).\nThe latter is proved by generalizing some arguments in [10] used to define the structure of\na complex Lie group on the Zucker extension JS\u0304Z (H) in the curve case. The proof consists\nof elementary calculations for norm estimates. Note that the Zucker extension outside the\nmonodromy invariant subspace is not necessarily Hausdorff, see e.g. [10], Remark 3.5 (iv).\nAs a corollary we get\nTheorem 3. The N\u00e9ron model of Green, Griffiths and Kerr JS\u0304GGK (H) is Hausdorff where\nw = \u22121.\nIn Section 1 we review some basic facts from the theory of Zucker extensions, admissible normal functions and limit mixed Hodge structures, and prepare some notation. In\nSection 2 we first show Theorem (2.1) on the norm estimate, and then prove Theorems 1\u20133.\n1. Preliminaries\nIn this section we review some basic facts from the theories of Zucker extensions, admissible\nnormal functions, and limit mixed Hodge structures, and prepare some notation.\n1.1. Family of intermediate Jacobians. Let S be a complex manifold of dimension n,\nand let H = ((L, F ), LZ) be a polarizable variation of Z-Hodge structure of weight w < 0\non S. Here (L, F ) is the underlying filtered locally free sheaf and LZ is the underlying\nZ-local system. We assume that LZ is torsion-free in this paper. Let V be the vector\nbundle on S corresponding to the locally free sheaf L/F 0 L, and let \u0393 \u2282 V denote the\nsubgroup over S corresponding to the subsheaf LZ \u2282 L/F 0 L. where the last injectivity\nfollows from the condition that the weight of H is negative. The family of intermediate\nJacobians is defined by\nJS (H) = V/\u0393,\n2\n\n\fwhere the quotient is set-theoretically taken fiberwise. This has a structure of a complex\nmanifold over S.\n1.2. Zucker extensions. Let S\u0304 be a partial compactification of S such that S\u0304 and\nD := S\u0304 \\ S are smooth. Let j : S \u2192 S\u0304 denote the inclusion. Let Lb be the Deligne\nextension of L such that the eigenvalues of the residues of the logarithmic connection\nare contained in [0, 1), see [5]. By Schmid [11], the Hodge filtration F on L is uniquely\nextended to a filtration F on Lb such that GrpF Lb are locally free (i.e. F p Lb = Lb \u2229 j\u2217 F p L).\nb \u2192 S\u0304 denote the vector bundle corresponding to the locally free sheaf L/F\nb 0 L.\nb\nLet \u03c0 : V\n0b\nb\nb\nb\nLet \u0393 be the subgroup of V over S\u0304 corresponding to j\u2217 LZ \u2282 L/F L. We define the Zucker\nextension by\nb \u0393.\nb\nJ Z (H) = V/\nS\u0304\n\nWe will show in Section 2 that it has a structure of a complex Lie group over S\u0304, see [10]\nfor the curve case.\nbD be the restriction of V\nb over D, and V\nb Inv be the union of the subspaces defined\nLet V\nD\nb := L/m\nb s Lb for s \u2208 D, where ms is the maximal ideal at s. The subspace\nby Ker N \u2282 L(s)\nb Inv will be denoted by J GGK (H)0 .\nof J Z (H) defined by the quotient of V\nD\n\nS\u0304\n\nS\u0304\n\n1.3. Admissible normal functions. A normal function is a holomorphic section \u03bd of\nJS (H) satisfying the Griffiths transversality. By Carlson [3] it corresponds to an extension\nclass of ZS by H giving a short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 H \u2192 H\u2032 \u2192 ZS \u2192 0.\n\n(1.3.1)\n\nA normal function \u03bd is called admissible with respect to a partial compactification S\u0304 of\nS if H\u2032 is an admissible variation of mixed Hodge structure ([9], [13]) with respect to S\u0304,\nsee [10]. Here S\u0304 is as in (1.2). In the unipotent monodromy case H\u2032 should satisfy the\nfollowing two conditions:\n(i) Grp GrW Lb\u2032 are locally free.\nF\n\nk\n\n(ii) The relative monodromy filtration exists.\n\nBy [8] these conditions in case w = \u22121 are equivalent respectively to\n(i)\u2032 A lifting \u03bde of \u03bd in V has logarithmic growth.\n\n(ii)\u2032 The local cohomological invariant \u03b3(\u03bd) is torsion, see also [10], Remark 1.6 (iv).\n\nHere the local cohomological invariant \u03b3(\u03bd) \u2208 H 1 (S, LZ ) = Ext1 (ZS , LZ ) is defined by\npassing to the underlying short exact sequence of Z-local systems of (1.3.1) after shrinking\nS\u0304 sufficiently, or by considering the 'monodromy' of a lifting \u03bde of \u03bd in V, see [8].\nIt is known that the normal function is extended to a section of the Zucker extension if\nand only if the local cohomological invariant \u03b3(\u03bd) vanishes, see e.g. [10], Prop. 2.3 and 2.4\n(and [7] for the geometric case). For example, if the local cohomological invariant vanishes,\nthen the normal function is given by the difference between two splittings \u03c3Z , \u03c3F of the\nunderlying short exact sequence of locally free sheaves of (1.3.1)\n0 \u2192 Lb \u2192 Lb\u2032 \u2192 OS\u0304 \u2192 0,\n3\n\n\fwhere \u03c3Z is defined over Z and \u03c3F is compatible with F . Moreover we have\nTheorem (Green, Griffiths, Kerr [8]). The above normal function passes through the\nsubspace JS\u0304GGK (H)0 .\nThis is proved by using the Griffiths transversality, see [8] for details.\n1.4. Limit mixed Hodge structure. From now on, assume S = \u2206\u2217 \u00d7 \u2206n\u22121 and\nS\u0304 = \u2206n where \u2206 is a polydisk. Let t = (t1 , t2 , . . . , tn ) be the coordinate system of \u2206n .\nSet S \u2032 = \u2206n\u22121 and t\u2032 = (t2 , . . . , tn ).\nLet H = ((L, F ), LZ) be a polarizable variation of Z-Hodge structure of weight w < 0,\nb F ) be as in (1.2). Assume the local monodromy T around t1 = 0 is unipotent.\nand let (L,\nSet N = log T . By Schmid [11] we have the limit mixed Hodge structure of H at 0\nH = (HZ , (HQ , W ), (HC ; W, F )) (or (HZ , W, F ) to simplify the notation).\nBy [5] (and [12] in the geometric case) HC can be defined as\nb (:= L/m\nb 0 L),\nb\nHC = L(0)\n\nb\nwhere m0 is the maximal ideal at 0, and F is the quotient filtration of F on L.\nFor A = Z, Q, R, HA is defined by\n(1.4.1)\nwhere\n\ne \u2217 \u00d7 S \u2032 , (\u03c1 \u00d7 id)\u2217 LA ),\nHA = \u0393(\u2206\ne \u2217 := {z \u2208 C | Re z > r0 } \u2192 \u2206\u2217\n\u03c1:\u2206\n\nis a universal covering defined by z 7\u2192 exp(2\u03c0iz) (with r0 > 0) and LA = LZ \u2297Z A for\nA = Q, R. We have the isomorphism (see [5])\nHC = HA \u2297A C,\ninduced by the injection HA \u2192 HC associating\n(1.4.2)\n\n\u0169 = exp(\u2212zN )u \u2208 Lb to u \u2208 HA ,\n\n1\nwhere z = 2\u03c0i\nlog t1 . Note that (1.4.2) gives a trivialization of the locally free sheaf Lb\n(which depends on the coordinate t1 ). In particular, {\u0169i } is a basis of Lb if {ui } is a basis\nof HA .\nThe weight filtration W is given by the monodromy filtration associated to N = log T\nup to the shift by w. This is characterized by the two conditions: N (Wj HA ) \u2282 Wj\u22122 HA\nfor any j, and\n\n(1.4.3)\n\n\u223c\n\nW\nN i : GrW\nw+i HA \u2212\u2192 Grw\u2212i HA\n\n4\n\nfor i > 0.\n\n\fIf A = C, this is compatible with F (up to a shift). We may assume for the proof of\nTheorem (2.1) that (1.4.3) holds also for A = Z replacing LZ if necessary (using the fact\nthat the action of N on GrW coincides with that of T \u2212 id). Note that\nN : (HZ , W, F ) \u2192 (HZ , W, F )(\u22121)\nis a morphism of mixed Z-Hodge structures (see [6] for the Tate twist), and hence K :=\nKer N is a mixed Z-Hodge structure of weights \u2264 w. Since w < 0, we have the injectivity\nof\nKZ \u2192 KC /F 0 KC .\n1.5. Two splittings of the weight filtration.

The\nexistence of \u03b1C is equivalent to that of a basis (vi,p,k ) of GrpF P GrW\nw+i HC such that vi,p,k\np\ni+1\nis represented by an element of F Ww+i HC annihilated by N\nwhere P GrW\nw+i denotes\nW\ni+1\nthe primitive part defined by Ker N\n\u2282 Grw+i . Here the problem is the annihilation by\ni+1\nN , and the existence is reduced to the surjections\nN i+1 : F p Ww+i\u22121 HC \u2192\n\u2192 F p\u2212i\u22121 Ww\u2212i\u22123 HC\n\nfor i > 0.\n\nThis is further reduced to the surjections\nN i+1 : F i GrW\n\u2192 F p\u2212i\u22121 GrW\nw+j HC \u2192\nw+j\u22122i\u22122 HC\n\nfor j \u2264 i \u2212 1,\n\nand follows from (1.4.3). The argument is similar for \u03b1Q , and it induces \u03b1R . We may\nassume for the proof of Theorem (2.1) that \u03b1Q induces the isomorphism \u03b1Z replacing\nLZ if necessary. However, \u03b1R is not compatible with \u03b1C unless W splits over A in a\ncompatible way with the Hodge filtration F .

We start with the following\n(a) Reduction to the case of a nilpotent orbit with S \u2032 = pt.\nUsing the trivialization of the vector bundle Lb given by (1.4.2), there is\nM (t) \u2208 HomC (F 0 GC , G<0\nC ) \u2297C \u0393(S\u0304, OS\u0304 ),\n\nsuch that the fiber of F 0 Lb at t \u2208 S\u0304 is expressed by the graph of M (t) using the following\ndirect sum decomposition in the notation of (1.7):\n0\nGC = G<0\nC \u2295 F GC .\n\nNote that M (0) = 0. Here GC is identified with HC by \u03b1C in (1.5.2).\n8\n\n\fBy the inverse of (1.4.2), \u1e7d \u2208 GC corresponds to a multivalued section v of L, which\nis expressed as\nP\n\n(2.3.1)\n\nk\u22650\n\ne O ).\nN k \u1e7d \u2297 z k /k! \u2208 GC \u2297C \u0393(S,\ne\nS\n\nb (see (1.8.3)) is given by\nUsing the above decomposition, its image in V\n\ne\n\u03c6(v) = \u03c6\u2032 (v) \u2212 M (t)\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (v) \u2208 G<0\nC \u2297C \u0393(S, OS\ne) with\nP\nP\n\u03c6\u2032 (v) = k\u22650 pr1 (N k \u1e7d) \u2297 z k /k!, \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (v) = k\u22650 pr2 (N k \u1e7d) \u2297 z k /k!,\n\n0\nwhere pr1 : GC \u2192 G<0\nC and pr2 : GC \u2192 F GC are the projections associated to the above\ndecomposition. By (1.6.2) we have\n\n|\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (\u03b9(u); z, t\u2032 )|k \u2264 CA(u, z)/y k \u2264 CA(u, z) for any 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m,\nwhere C > 0 is independent of u, z, t\u2032 (and 1 \u2264 y \u2264 |z| \u2264 2y because r \u2265 1).

Then\n|M (t)\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (\u03b9(u); z, t\u2032 )|k \u2264 \u03b5A(u, z)/y k\n\nfor any 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m,\n\nif 1/r and \u03b7 are sufficiently small (depending only on C \u2032 , m and \u03b5). So we may replace \u03c6\nand \u03b5 in (2.1.1) by \u03c6\u2032 and 2\u03b5 respectively. Thus the assertion is reduced to the case H is a\nnilpotent orbit, where M (t) = 0 and \u03c6\u2032\u2032 = 0.

In\nthis case we have A(u(i) , z) = |u(i) |, and this can be bounded essentially by |v (i) | using the\ninjectivity of\nGZ \u2229 Ker N \u2192 GC /F 0 .\nSince u \u2208 GZ \\Ker N , we see that (2.3.5) holds also in this case if we assume in the notation\nof (1.9.2) r is sufficiently large compared to\n\u03b5\u2032 |v (i) |/\u03b5E(GZ ).\nThus (2.3.5) holds for any i.

Since the assertion depends only on the underlying variation of R-Hodge structure,\nwe may assume that H is defined only over R (forgetting the Q-structure). Furthermore,\nif H = H\u2032 \u2295 H\u2032\u2032 and the assertion holds for H\u2032 , H\u2032\u2032 , then the assertion also holds for H\n(modifying \u03b5 if necessary). Indeed, for u = u\u2032 + u\u2032\u2032 and v = v \u2032 + v \u2032\u2032 with u\u2032 , v \u2032 coming from\nH\u2032 and similarly for u\u2032\u2032 , v \u2032\u2032 , we have\n|\u03c6(\u03b9(u\u2032 ), z) \u2212 v \u2032 |k \u2264 |\u03c6(\u03b9(u), z) \u2212 v|k \u2264 2\u03b5A(u\u2032 , z)/y k ,\nif A(u\u2032 , z) \u2265 A(u\u2032\u2032 , z). Thus the assertion is reduced to the case dim P GrW\nw+i HR = 1 or\nW\n2. In the two-dimensional case, take a basis (v, v\u0304) of P Grw+i HC which is compatible with\nthe Hodge decomposition.\nThen av + a\u2032 v\u0304 is real if and only if \u0101 = a\u2032 .

For f \u2208 C[z], set\nbk = (dk (f \u2212 a)/dz k )(z0 ).\nThere is g(z) \u2208 C[z]\u2264n\u2212n1 such that\nf (z) \u2212 a =\n\nP\n\n0\u2264k<n1\n\n(bk /k!)(z \u2212 z0 )k + g(z)(z \u2212 z0 )n1 .\n\nUsing the binomial coefficients, we see that\n(2.5.2)\n\nA((z \u2212 z0 )k , z0 ) = A((z \u2212 z\u03040 )k , z0 ) \u2264 C(k)y0k ,\n\nwhere C(k) > 0 depends only on k. Applying the Leibniz rule to g(z)(z \u2212 z0 )n1 and using\n(2.5.1), we then get\nA(f \u2212 a, z0 ) \u2264 \u03b5C1 A(f, z0 ) + C2 A(g, z0 )y0n1 ,\nwhere C1 , C2 > 0 (depending only on n, n1 ). This implies\n(2.5.3)\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5C1 )A(f, z0 ) \u2264 C2 A(g, z0 )y0n1 + |a|.\n\nOn the other hand, the above equation can be modified as\nP\n\u1e21(z) = (z \u2212 z\u03040 )\u2212n1 ((f \u0304(z) \u2212 a\u2032 ) + (a\u2032 \u2212 \u0101)) \u2212 0\u2264k<n1 (b\u0304k /k!)(z \u2212 z\u03040 )k\u2212n1 .\n\nThen (2.5.1) implies similarly\n\n|(dk \u1e21/dz k )(z0 )| \u2264 \u03b5C3 A(f, z0 )/y0k+n1 + C4 (|a| + |a\u2032 |)/y0k+n1\n12\n\nfor 0 \u2264 k < n2 ,\n\n\fwhere C3 , C4 > 0 (depending only on n, n1 ). Assuming \u03b5 \u2264 (2C1 )\u22121 and using (2.5.3), we\nthen get\n|(dk \u1e21/dz k )(z0 )| \u2264 \u03b5C5 A(g, z0 )/y0k + C6 (|a| + |a\u2032 |)/y0k+n1\n\nfor 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 n1 ,\n\nwhere C5 , C6 > 0 (depending only on n, n1 ). Combined with (2.5.2), this implies\nA(g, z0 ) \u2264 \u03b5C7 A(g, z0 ) + C8 (|a| + |a\u2032 |)/y0n1\n\nfor 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 n1 ,\n\nwhere C7 , C8 > 0 (depending only on n, n1 ). Assuming \u03b5 \u2264 (2C7 )\u22121 , we deduce from this\nand (2.5.3)\nA(f, z0 ) \u2264 C9 (|a| + |a\u2032 |),\nwhere C9 > 0 (depending only on n, n1 ). So the assertion follows. This completes the\nproofs of Lemma (2.5), Proposition (2.4) and Theorem (2.1)(i).\n2.6. Proof of Theorem (2.1)(ii). We have vk = 0 since k > 0 and v \u2208 Ker N . So it is\nenough to show\n|\u03c6(\u03b9(u); z, t\u2032 )|k \u2264 \u03b5A(u, z)/y k\n\n(j)\n\nif uk\u2032 = 0 for k \u2032 \u2265 k.\n\nThen the assertion is reduced to the nilpotent orbit case by (2.3.2) (replacing \u03b5, \u03b5\u2032 , r if\nnecessary). In this case we have\n|\u03c6(\u03b9(u); z, t\u2032 )|k = 0\n\n(j)\n\nif uk\u2032 = 0 for k \u2032 \u2265 k,\n\nbecause \u03b9i,j,k = 0 for k < 0 by (1.6.2). So the assertion follows.\nFrom Theorem (2.1) we can deduce\nb Inv , there is a sufficiently small open neighborhood Up of p\n2.7. Corollary.

Proof of Theorem 1. Taking a finite covering, the assertion is reduced to the case\nwhere the local monodromy is unipotent. Let \u03bd be an admissible normal function such\nthat the local cohomological invariant \u03b3(\u03bd) is torsion, see (1.3). Then there is a normal\nfunction \u03bc whose associated exact sequence (1.3.1) splits after tensoring with Q and such\nthat\n\u03b3(\u03bd) = \u03b3(\u03bc).\nLet \u03bde, \u03bc\ne be multivalued holomorphic sections of V lifting \u03bd and \u03bc respectively. Since \u03bc\nvanishes by the scaler extension Z \u2192 Q, there is a positive integer m such that m\u03bc = 0,\n1\n\u0393. Set\ni.e. \u03bc\ne is a multivalued section of m\n\u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd \u2212 \u03bc,\n\n\u03bde\u2032 = \u03bde \u2212 \u03bc\ne.\n\nFor the study of the zero locus of \u03bd, it is then sufficient to consider the intersection\n\u03bde\u2032 \u2229 (\u0393 \u2212 \u03bc\ne) (\u2282 \u03bde\u2032 \u2229\n\n(2.9.1)\n\n1\n\u0393),\nm\n\ninstead of \u03bde \u2229 \u0393.

(Indeed, if \u03bc\ne\u2032 + \u03bc\ne is a\n\u2032\nmultivalued section of \u0393, then \u03bc\ne coincides with \u2212e\n\u03bc replacing \u03bc\ne if necessary, and hence \u03bc\ne\nis univalent. But this contradicts the condition that \u03b3(\u03bc) = \u03b3(\u03bd) 6= 0.) This implies that\nthe zero locus of \u03bd is empty on a neighborhood of 0.\n1 b\n\u0393 with \u03b3(\u03bd) = 0, then we may assume \u03bc\ne = 0, \u03bde\u2032 = \u03bde, m = 1, and\nIf \u03bde\u2032 (0) \u2208 m\nfurthermore \u03bde(0) = 0 replacing \u03bde if necessary. So the assertion follows from (2.9.2).\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.\n\n2.11. Proof of Theorem 3. By definition [8] (see also [10]), the N\u00e9ron model JS\u0304GGK (H)\nis the union of Y\u03bd := JS\u0304GGK (H)0 |U(\u03bd) , where \u03bd runs over normal functions defined over open\nsubsets U (\u03bd) \\ D which are admissible with respect to U (\u03bd). We have the identifications\nY\u03bd |U(\u03bd)\u2229U(\u03bd \u2032 )\\D \u223c\n= Y\u03bd \u2032 |U(\u03bd)\u2229U(\u03bd \u2032 )\\D ,\n\ninduced by \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd \u2032 over U (\u03bd) \u2229 U (\u03bd \u2032 ) \\ D if the cohomology classes of \u03bd and \u03bd \u2032 are different.\nIn case they coincide, then the isomorphisms is extended over U (\u03bd) \u2229 U (\u03bd \u2032 ). Moreover we\nmay assume that the \u03bd are torsion since w = \u22121.
