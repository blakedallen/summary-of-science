The latest experiment of this class is the polarized M\u00f8ller scattering. As only the electrons are involved, theory calculations at quantum\nloop levels can be performed free of hadronic uncertainties making it an ideal process for\nprecision SM testing; any deviation from expectations will also be a clear signal of new\nphysics beyond the SM.\nA while ago, an experiment of this type has been successfully completed [2], where parityviolating measurements have been made from the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons \u2013 either left-handed (LH) or right-handed (RH) \u2013 on an unpolarized electron target.\nAt a momentum transfer of Q2 = 0.026 GeV2 , the left-right asymmetry\nALR \u2261\n\nd\u03c3L \u2212 d\u03c3R\n,\nd\u03c3L + d\u03c3R\n\n(1)\n\nhas been measured to an accuracy of approximately 20 ppb, and the weak angle determined\nto be sin2 \u03b8W = 0.2397 \u00b1 0.0010 (stat.) \u00b1 0.0008 (syst.), with its running established at the\n6\u03c3 level. In the SM, ALR arises from the interference between the electromagnetic and the\nweak neutral currents, and is given by\nh\ni\nG\u03bc Q2\n1\u2212y\n2 MS\n\u221a\nASM\n=\n1\n\u2212\n4\nsin\n\u03b8\n,\nLR\nW\n2\u03c0\u03b1 1 + y 4 + (1 \u2212 y)4\n\nQ2 = ys ,\n\ns = 2me Ebeam ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere G\u03bc = 1.16637(1) \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 , \u03b1\u22121 = 137.0356, and terms involving the electron\n\nmass me have been dropped when appropriate. The electroweak corrections matching this\nexperimental accuracy and more is given in Ref. [3]. The value of the weak angle at Q2 = 0\nMS\n= 0.23867 \u00b1 0.00016 in an updated analysis [4]. We use this value in\nis found to be sin2 \u03b8W\n\nall our numerical calculations below.\nRecently, a 12 GeV energy upgrade to the intense electron facility at JLAB has been\napproved. This raises the possibility of measuring ALR to an accuracy of 1 ppb. Since the\ntheoretical uncertainty can in principle be calculated to this accuracy, a successful measurement will be sensitive to the new physics at the several TeV scale, which is also the physics\nlandscape to be explored by the LHC.\nAlso recently, an anomalous abundance of positron flux in cosmic radiation has been\nreported by the PAMELA collaboration [5]. This confirms the excess previously observed\n2\n\n\fby the HEAT [6] and AMS [7] experiments. The ATIC [8] and PPB-BETS [9] balloon\nexperiments have also recorded similar excess. One possible origin is from a hidden sector\nand low scale dark matter annihilation [10]. The hidden sector scale is O(GeV), and so is\nat the opposite end of the new heavy physics. The characteristic of this class of model is\nthat possible couplings to SM matter fields must be extremely weak. A very simple model\nwas constructed previously to study this possibility [11], and M\u00f8ller scattering was found to\ngive very stringent constraints.\nMotivated by all these encouraging developments, we examine in detail how an improved ALR measurement could shed light on new physics. We focus here on classes of\nnon-superymmetric new physics and how they might manifest themselves in precision polarized M\u00f8ller scattering. It is well known that ALR can be used to probe the existence\nof doubly charged scalars and extra Z \u2032 bosons. The doubly charged scalars are interesting\nin their own right, and they also arise in Type II seesaw models for neutrino masses [12].\nFor extra Z \u2032 bosons, the literature is particularly rich with well motivated models. These\ninclude models of grand unified theory (GUT) based on the E6 or SO(10) gauge group [13],\nhidden sector Z \u2032 models [11, 14], and left-right symmetric [15] and warped extra-dimensional\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) [16] models based on the gauge group SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L .\n\nThe effects of a new particle such as the doubly charged scalar of the extra Z \u2032 boson can\nbe encoded in an effective operator approach, which for ALR involve only two dimension six\noperators:\nO1 = \u0113\u03b3 \u03bc L\u0302e \u0113\u03b3\u03bc L\u0302e ,\n\nO2 = \u0113\u03b3 \u03bc R\u0302e \u0113\u03b3\u03bc R\u0302e ,\n\n1\nL\u0302 = (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) ,\n2\n\n1\nR\u0302 = (1 + \u03b35 ) .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nIn the next section, we describe this effective operator approach.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. III, we discuss the classes of new\nphysics models. Besides updating relevant known results, we also present a new calculation\nof the contributions in the Minimal Custodial RS (MCRS) model with bulk symmetry\nSU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L , and we give comparisons with the usual four dimensional\nleft-right symmetric models. Sec. IV contains our conclusions. The details of the MCRS\nmodel and the specifics of the fermion localization are collected into Appendix. A.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nEFFECTIVE OPERATORS\nA.\n\nHigh Scale New Physics\n\nIf the new physics is at a scale higher than the Fermi scale v \u2243 247 GeV, an effective\noperator approach is powerful and avoids much model dependence. Denoting the scale of\nnew physics by \u039b and assuming that the SM gauge group holds between \u039b and v, the effective\nLagrangian with dimension six four-lepton operators added is given by\nL = LSM + L6 ,\ncLL\ncLR\ncRR\n\u22122L6 = 2 (L\u0304a \u03b3 \u03bc La )(L\u0304b \u03b3\u03bc Lb ) + 2 (L\u0304a \u03b3 \u03bc La )(eR \u03b3\u03bc eR ) + 2 (eR \u03b3 \u03bc eR )(eR \u03b3\u03bc eR )\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\ndLL\n+ 2 (L\u0304a \u03b3 \u03bc Lb )(L\u0304b \u03b3\u03bc La ) + h.c. ,\n\u039b\n\n(4)\n\nwhere a, b are SU(2) indices, and L = (\u03bd, e)TL . The subscripts L and R denote the usual\nchiral projection. We have included only terms relevant for the calculation of ALR , i.e. the\nfirst generation leptons. Note that for scattering of a polarized beam on a polarized target,\nthere is also a scalar operator that contributes:\nLs =\n\ncS\nLeR eR L + h.c.\n2\u039b2\n\n(5)\n\nA full analysis of dimension six leptonic operators can be found in Ref. [17].\nThe Wilson coefficients c and d are given by specific models at \u039b. One has to do a\nrenormalization group (RG) running analysis to determine their values at the relevant low\nenergy scale where the experiments are performed. The RG equations for these coefficients\ncan be found in Ref. [17]. Numerically, we find that the RG running effects are not significant.\nThey give about a 4% effect running between \u039b (typically a few TeV) and v, and hence can\nbe neglected in the first approximation. Below v the running is governed by the well known\n\u03b2QED funtions. Including them leads to a change of about 10% in the values of the coefficients\n\u221a\nbetween \u039b and s \u2243 0.1 GeV. We neglect these small RG running effects below which would\nnot impact our analysis given the current level of precision in the experimental inputs and\nthe exploratory nature of our study.\nThe asymmetry ALR is found by calculating the diagrams depicted in Fig. 1 The shaded\nblob schematically includes all new physics effects such as Z-Z \u2032 mixing and virtual exchanges\n\n4\n\n\fe\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\n\u03b3, Z\n\ne\n\nFIG. 1: Feynman diagrams contributing to ALR . The shaded blob contains all new physics effects.\n\nof new particles. For \u039b2 \u226b s \u226b m2e valid for the 12 GeV experiment, one has\nALR = ASM\nLR + \u03b4ALR\n4G\u03bc s\ny(1 \u2212 y)\n=\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03b1 1 + y 4 + (1 \u2212 y)4\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n1\nMS\n\u2212 sin2 \u03b8W\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nc\u2032 \u2212 cRR\n\u221a\n+ LL\n4 2G\u03bc \u039b2\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere y = \u2212 st , c\u2032LL = cLL + dLL , and \u03b4ALR denotes the deviation of the asymmetry from the\nSM prediction arising from new physics. The one-loop SM radiative corrections are encoded\nin the precise value of sin2 \u03b8W evaluated in the MS scheme. The effective operators, O1,2 ,\ncan arise from numerous new physics models, and those coming from the tree-level exchange\nof virtual particles are the most important. We thus examine models with at least an extra\nneutral gauge boson, Z \u2032 , or doubly charged scalars below in Sec. III, where we give Wilson\ncoefficients in various models. Of course there could be extra charged gauged bosons that\nalso contribute in specific models, but these typically come in at the loop level and so are\nless important.\nWe remark here that the new physics effects in M\u00f8ller scattering can also come in through\nthe Zee coupling being modified. This is particularly evident in cases when the heavy states\nof the new physics also have very small couplings to electrons so that the virtual exchange\nprocess is suppressed both by the propagator effect and the small coupling. Example of\nthis can be found in the extra hidden sector/shadow U(1) and RS models which we discuss\nbelow in Sec. III D and III E.\n\nB.\n\nLow Scale New Phyiscs\n\nFor the class of models where new physics arise at a scale \u039b . v, two effects are at work.\nThe first is due to the exchange of the new low mass particle. The propagator effect has to\n5\n\n\fbe compensated by its small couplings to the electrons of different chiralities. The second\nis due to the modification of the SM Z coupling to the electrons. Well known examples are\nmodels with extra Z \u2032 that can mix with the Z. Details are given below in Sec. III.\n\nIII.\n\nMODEL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIn this section, we discuss how new physics can be probed by polarized M\u00f8ller scattering\nin various non-supersymmetric extensions of the SM. We begin with models that contain\nextra neutral Z \u2032 bosons. A comprehensive review on the physics of Z \u2032 can be found in\nRef. [18].\nIrrespective of the ultimate origin of the extra neutral gauge boson, its interactions can\nbe described by the gauge group, SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)\u2032 , at a scale not too high compare\n\nto v [19].

After the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry, this\nmass term will lead to a mass mixing among W3 , B, and X fields which depend on zH .\nFor models with zH = 0 but a non-vanishing kinetic mixing between the neutral gauge\nbosons, the transformation between the weak and mass basis is given by\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\u03b3\n1 0 0\ncW \u2212sW 0\nB\u2032\n\uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ecW3 \uf8f7 = \uf8ecsW cW 0\uf8f7 \uf8ec0 c\u03b7 \u2212s\u03b7 \uf8f7 \uf8ec Z \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\u2032\nZ\u2032\n0 s\u03b7 c\u03b7\n0\n0 1\nX\n\n(10)\n\nwhere sW (cW ) denotes sin \u03b8W (cos \u03b8W ), and similarly for the angle \u03b7.

There are also no kinetic mixing, and the mass\nmixings between the gauge bosons of the extra U(1) factors and the SM Z are phenomenologically found to be negligible. The X boson above is now a linear combination of the \u03c8\nand \u03c7 gauge bosons\nX \u03bc (\u03b2) = B\u03c8\u03bc sin \u03b2 + B\u03c7\u03bc cos \u03b2 ,\n\n(17)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nwhere B\u03c8,\n\u03c7 are gauge fields of the U(1)\u03c8, \u03c7 respectively.

We\nuse the Tevatron limits on the ZI\u2032 and Z\u03b7\u2032 masses to illustrate the current collider constraints\non the new physics scale \u039b for the GUT extra neutral gauge bosons 2 . The 95% confidence\nlevel (CL) lower mass limit for ZI\u2032 (Z\u03b7\u2032 ) is MZI\u2032 > 729 GeV (MZ\u03b7\u2032 > 891 GeV), representing\nthe lowest (highest) exclusion limit in the CDF search [22]. The SLAC E158 measurement\nof the left-right asymmetry [2] gives\nALR = 131 \u00b1 14 (stat) \u00b1 10 (syst) ppb .\n1\n\n2\n\n(19)\n\nAs can be seen from Eq. (14), with \u2206 \u223c O(100) GeV and MX & O(1) TeV expected, the Z0 \u2212 X mass\nmixing is small with sin \u03b8 . O(0.01). We thus follow common practice and neglect the small corrections\nto ALR due to the mass mixing and the concurrent modification in the gauge-fermion couplings, which\nare proportional to (sin \u03b8)2 .\np\np\nIn our notation, ZI\u2032 and Z\u03b7\u2032 are just X with tan \u03b2 = 3/5 and \u2212 5/3 respectively. See Eq. (17).\n\n9\n\n\f\u22127\nTaking ASM\nfor Q2 = 0.026 GeV2 and y = 0.6, one can infer from this that\nLR = 1.47 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22120.337 < \u03b4LR < 0.122 at 95% CL 3 . Lastly, as a benchmark assume that the total 1\u03c3 error\n\nof the new JLAB measurement of ALR to be 1 ppb with a central value given by the SM\nvalue, ASM\nLR , one expects in such a case |\u03b4LR | < 0.0136 at 95% CL. We see from Fig. 2 that\ncurrent experiments do not constrain TeV scale GUT new physics, but the upcoming 1 ppb\nJLAB experiment can be expected to do so.\n\nB.\n\nLeft-Right Symmetric Models\n\nFor left-right symmetric models, the gauge group is taken to be SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7\nU(1)B\u2212L . The SU(2)R is broken down to a U(1)R by a triplet Higgs field at a scale greater\nthan a few TeV, leaving SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L . In this case, the U(1)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L is\n\nequivalent to the U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)\u2032 [19]. The charges zf and zH can be determined by enforcing\nanomaly cancellation conditions (see below). We find\nc\u2032LL \u2212 cRR =\n\n\u0001\n1\n3gY2 \u2212 gR2 ,\n4\n\n(20)\n\nwhere gR is the gauge coupling of SU(2)R . Interestingly, note that even if gR = gL , \u03b4LR will\nnot vanish. We plot in Fig. 3 the resulting \u03b4LR for left-right symmetric models, as well as\nthe relevant SLAC E158 constraint and that projected from the JLAB 1 ppb measurement.\nAs a comparion, we plot also the curve that arises from the ZLR 95% CL lower mass limit,\nMZLR > 630 GeV, obtained from the combination of electroweak data, direct Tevatron and\nindirect LEP II searches [18]. We see that current experiments do offer, if only barely, some\nconstraints on the TeV scale new physics here compared to the GUT case. But for useful\nones, the precision of the upcoming JLAB experiment is still much needed.\n\nC.\n\nSU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)X Models\n\nThere are interesting bottom up models where the extra U(1) factors are not immediately\nrelated to the remnant of some broken down non-abelian groups. The prime example is the\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L model. The assumption is that the SM is charged under U(1)X ,\n3\n\nWe have followed the more common practice here in taking the 1\u03c3 total error as the statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties added in quadrature.

All limits are given at 95% CL.\n\nand since this group is known to be anomalous, one has to demand anomaly cancellations for\nchiral fermions under the full SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)X . As neutrinos are massive,\nwe introduce one sterile neutrino, NR , per family and denote its charge by zN . Assuming\nthese charges are family independent, we have seven independent charges zf , zN , and zH .\nThe anomaly conditions arise from\n[SU(3)]2 U(1)X ,\n\n[SU(2)]2 U(1)X ,\n\n[U(1)Y ]2 U(1)X ,\n\n[U(1)X ]3 .\n\n(21)\n\nThe mix gravitational and U(1)X anomaly give the same condition as [U(1)X ]3 and is redundant. The Yukawa terms that give quark and lepton masses yielded one additional\ncondition. Thus there are two independent charges, which we choose to be zL and ze . The\nother charges are\n1\nzQ = \u2212 zL ,\n3\n\n2\nzu = zL \u2212 ze ,\n3\n\n4\nzd = \u2212 zL + ze ,\n3\n\nzN = 2zL \u2212 ze ,\n\nzH = zL \u2212 ze . (22)\n\nFor the interesting case where X = B \u2212 L, we have the familiar lepton and baryon\n\nnumber assignments, and zH = 0. More importantly, if the extra Z \u2032 arises directly from the\nbreaking of a gauged U(1)B\u2212L , M\u00f8ller scattering will yield only the SM result, since in that\ncase zL = ze ; this leads immediately to c\u2032LL \u2212 cRR = 0. In general, zL 6= ze , and we find\nc\u2032LL \u2212 cRR = g \u20322 (zL2 \u2212 ze2 ) ,\n11\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere g \u2032 is the gauge coupling constant of the U(1)X . Note that in this analysis the masses\nof the sterile neutrinos do not come into play. Hence the details of the mechanism for\ngenerating active neutrinos masses will not change our results. We plot in Fig. 4 contours\nof constant \u03b4LR as a function of g \u2032zL and g \u2032ze for \u039b = 1 TeV.

The extra U(1)hid\nis a gauge symmetry of a hidden sector with its own scalar sector. The hidden sector and\nthe SM communicate through hidden scalars couplings with the SM Higgs [11] and kinetic\nmixing [23].

We see that the neutral current\n\ncouplings are not only rotated as indicated by the c\u03b7 factor, but they also contain an extra\npiece proportional to the fermion hypercharge due to the U(1)-U(1)X mixing. Hence we\nneed to re-examine the electroweak precision data using the full couplings as well as taking\ninto account the effects due to virtual Z \u2032 exchanges.\nAs mentioned above, there are two interesting limits with very different phenomenologies\ndepending on whether MX is greater or less than MW , which correspond to high or low scale\nnew physics.\n\n1.\n\nMX \u226b MW\n\nFrom Eq. (11) we can see that \u03b7 \u226a \u01eb and the mixing can be ignored. The most stringent\nconstraints come from electroweak precision measurements at the Z-pole. As for M\u00f8ller\nscattering, the exchange of the Z \u2032 gives negligible effect because its large mass and very\nsmall coupling to the electrons (see Eq. (25)).

The gauge hierarchy problem\nis solved when the warp factor is taken to be k\u03c0rc \u2248 37 [16]. This sets the scale for the\nnew physics to mKK \u2248 4 TeV where the lowest Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation first arises 4 .\nThe bulk SU(2)R factor protects the \u03c1 parameter in the effective 4D theory from excessive\ncorrections coming from KK excitations, and is broken by orbifold boundary conditions on\nthe UV boundary (brane); this is a 5D generalization of the case studied in Sec. III B. A\nbrief summary of the model is given in Appendix A, which sets our notations.\nIn the MCRS model, \u03b4LR arise due to the interactions of KK excitations of the neutral\ngauge bosons and the charged leptons. Contributions come either from direct virtual exchanges of neutral gauge KK modes, or through the Ze\u0113 coupling been modified due to\nmixings of SM modes with KK modes. The latter involve both fermions and gauge bosons,\n4\n\nNote this is at the higher end of the LHC discovery limits.\n\n15\n\n\fand is similar to the shadow Z \u2032 case discussed above. More details of the vertex correction\ndue to KK mixings can be found in Appendix A.\nA generic feature of the extra dimensional models is that gauge-f f \u0304 couplings are not\nflavor diagonal in the mass eigenbasis. To calculate the contributions to \u03b4LR in the mass\neigenbasis requires the knowledge of both the LH and RH rotation matrices, which are\ndetermined by the mass matrix of the charged leptons and their localization in the extra\ndimension (see Ref. [26]). In Table II, we list the contributions pertinent to the case of\npolarized M\u00f8ller scattering 5 .

This is because the gauge KK modes are heavy\n\n6\n\nand\n\ncouplings of the electron to gauge KK modes are small. Note that the LL-type contribution\nis always greater that of the RR-type. This is a consequence of the fact that the LH charge is\ngreater than the RH charge, i.e. |QLZ (e)| > |QR\nZ (e)|. Note also the new physics contributions\nare quite stable across the configurations, indicating their robustness with respect to the\nvariations in the charged lepton mass matrix. The MCRS values of \u03b4LR at mKK \u2248 4 TeV\nare well within the projected JLAB limits of |\u03b4LR | < 0.0136.\nF.\n\nDoubly Charged Scalars\n\nDoubly charged scalars P \u00b1\u00b1 are motivated by Type II seesaw neutrino mass generation\nmechanisms. They can be either SU(2)L singlets or triplets, and they carry two units\nof lepton number. The contribution of P \u00b1\u00b1 to M\u00f8ller scattering depends on only two\nparameters, viz. its mass, MP , and its coupling to electrons, yee .

We plot the \u03b4LR arising from doubly charged scalars coupling only to RH electrons\nin Fig. 6, as well as the relevant constraints from the SLAC E158 and the projected JLAB\n1 ppb measurement.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have examined in detail the implications of a very high precision polarized M\u00f8ller\nscattering experiment on new physics beyond the SM, which is well known to be sensitive to\nextra Z \u2032 and doubly charged scalars in the few TeV mass range.

The solid, dashed, and dotted lines denote cases where\n\u039b = 1, 2, 4 TeV respectively. The horizontal lines marks the SLAC E158 upper limit, \u03b4LR = 0.122,\nand the projected JLAB upper limit, \u03b4LR = 0.0136. All limits are given at 95% CL.\n\na measurement can be particularly useful if such a state is found at the LHC. If a doubly\ncharged scalar were discovered at the LHC, a measurement of the \u03b4LR will determine its\nYukawa couplings to electrons, and the sign of \u03b4LR will determine whether it couples to LH\nor RH electrons (negative for the former, positive for the latter). Such scalars also carry\ntwo units of lepton number, hence measurements of \u03b4LR will in turn have impact on the\npredicted rates of neutrinoless double beta decays of nuclei [12], thus providing invaluable\ninformation on the origin of neutrino masses. Similarly, if an extra Z \u2032 were discovered,\nmeasuring \u03b4LR will shed light on its origin. We have given detailed calculations for various\nclasses of models including the E6 GUT model, left-right symmetric model, and two examples\nof non-anomalous U(1).\nFor high scale new physics, we found if the new particle is of the more exotic type such\nas a hidden/shadow Z \u2032 or the pure KK Z \u2032 in warped extra-dimension RS scenarios, \u03b4LR\nmeasures the change in the effective Ze\u0113 couplings as compare to the SM, and it is not\nsensitive to the mass of these new gauge bosons. In the scenario where the new physics is of\na very low scale (\u226a v), and a Z \u2032 with a small mass exists that couples very weakly to SM\nfermions, a \u03b4LR measurement gives even more valuable information not available from high\nenergy hadron collider experiments. We have shown that the SLAC E158 experiment can\nalready tightly constrains the mixings of this type of Z \u2032 with the SM Z. The smallness of the\nmixings allowed conforms with string-theoretic expectations, as well as phenomenological\n\n18\n\n\fdeterminations [11]. On the other hand, the positive deviation from the SM expectation in\nthe measured value of muon g \u2212 2 cannot be accommodated by such a light shadow Z \u2032 since\nit gives a negative contribution. To the best of our knowledge there is no cleaner or better\nmeasurements on couplings of a hidden/shadow Z \u2032 to electrons. These are valuable inputs\nto dark matter model building employing a hidden or shadow sector.\nIt is clear that an extra Z \u2032 or doubly charged scalars with masses in the 1 to 2 TeV\nrange can be found at the LHC relatively easily. We have shown that \u03b4LR can provide\ncross checks on these measurements as well as independent information on the couplings to\nelectrons of different chiralities. If the masses are & 4 TeV, discovery at the LHC will take\nlonger, and may have to await an intensity upgrade to the Super LHC (SLHC). Then it is\neven more important to do a high precision \u03b4LR measurement. The current reach of new\nphysics of a 10 ppb measurement achieved at SLAC is around 1 to 2 TeV. Given the same\ncouplings, a 1% measurement will probe new physics at a scale \u039b \u223c 3 \u2212 6 TeV, and so is\nnicely complementary to the SLHC. This is true in particular for the MCRS model, as the\nquark sector flavor bounds already constrained the masses of the lowest KK modes to be in\nat or above this range.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe research of W.F.C. is supported by the Taiwan NSC under Grant No. 96-2112M-007-020-MY3.

To solve the hierarchy problem, one takes\nk\u03c0rc \u2248 37. The warped down scale is defined to be k\u0303 = ke\u2212k\u03c0rc .

(A7) are found with \u03c1ij and \u03c6ij randomly generated in the\nintervals (0, 2) and [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) respectively. In the following, for each of the five charged lepton\nconfigurations determined by the c-parameter sets cL and cE , we list for a typical solution\nthat passes all current LFV constraints the mass eigenvalues, the magnitude of the complex\nmass matrix, |M|, of the solution, and the magnitude and phase of the corresponding 5D\nYukawa coupling matrix 7 . All numerical values are given to four significant figures (except\n\nfor the mass eigenvalues, which required more accuracy to distinguish m\u03c4 ). The mass\neigenvalues agree with the charged masses at 1 TeV found in Ref. [29] to within one standard\n7\n\nWe need not list arg M because it is the same as \u03c6, as can be seen from Eq. (A7).\n\n22\n\n\fdeviations quoted.\n\u2022 Configuration I:\ncL = {0.6265, 0.5562, 0.5002} ,\n\ncE = {\u22120.6911, \u22120.5806, \u22120.5192}\n\n{me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 } = {4.95902 * 10\u22124 , 0.104688, 1.77976}\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0.0003248 0.004970 0.04274\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n|M| = \uf8ec 0.001416 0.04607 0.3908 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0.009891 0.2738 1.717\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec 0.2714 \u22120.8414 \u22123.055\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0.6598 0.2733 0.4445\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1 = \uf8ec0.3272 0.2883 0.4624\uf8f7 , \u03c6 = \uf8ec\u22121.509 2.910 \u22121.787\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\u22121.294 1.547\n0\n0.6022 0.4513 0.5351\n\n(B1)\n\n(B2)\n\n(B3)\n\n\u2022 Configuration II:\n\ncL = {0.6474, 0.5802, 0.5172} ,\n\ncE = {\u22120.6714, \u22120.5566, \u22120.5026}\n\n{me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 } = {4.95902 * 10\u22124 , 0.104688, 1.78001}\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0.0003856 0.008502 0.03564\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n|M| = \uf8ec 0.002473 0.04427 0.3681 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0.009663 0.2984 1.718\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u22122.562 \u22121.623\n3.094\n0.7999 0.4591 0.5226\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1 = \uf8ec0.5945 0.2770 0.6256\uf8f7 , \u03c6 = \uf8ec\u22121.491 \u22120.6484 \u22120.05579\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\u22121.274 2.565\n0\n0.4253 0.3419 0.5346\n\n(B4)\n\n(B5)\n\n(B6)\n\n\u2022 Configuration III:\n\ncL = {0.6903, 0.5694, 0.5165} ,\n\ncE = {\u22120.6269, \u22120.5683, \u22120.5029}\n\n{me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 } = {4.95902 * 10\u22124 , 0.104688, 1.77966}\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0.0006886 0.002653 0.009256\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n|M| = \uf8ec 0.01672 0.1594 0.5872 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0.03637 0.1366\n1.670\n23\n\n(B7)\n\n(B8)\n\n\f\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u22122.730\n\u22122.449\n0.7525\n1.375\n0.8461\n0.5746\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1 = \uf8ec0.6662 1.014 0.7273\uf8f7 , \u03c6 = \uf8ec\u22120.9022 \u22120.2020 \u22123.037\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n1.814\n2.844\n0\n0.3606 0.2163 0.5147\n\uf8eb\n\n(B9)\n\n\u2022 Configuration IV:\n\ncL = {0.6908, 0.5786, 0.5142} ,\n\ncE = {\u22120.6277, \u22120.5583, \u22120.5057}\n\n{me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 } = {4.95902 * 10\u22124 , 0.104688, 1.77990}\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0.0007459 0.002838 0.01386\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n|M| = \uf8ec 0.01879 0.1771 0.5452 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0.03762 0.2517 1.669\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n1.701 1.106 \u22121.161\n1.556 0.6898 0.9268\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1 = \uf8ec 1.009 1.108 0.9381\uf8f7 , \u03c6 = \uf8ec\u22121.361 \u22121.094 2.471 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n0\n\u22122.407 0.6682\n0.3642 0.2838 0.5176\n\n(B10)\n\n(B11)\n\n(B12)\n\n\u2022 Configuration V:\n\ncL = {0.6477, 0.5689, 0.5002} ,\n\ncE = {\u22120.6714, \u22120.5681, \u22120.5190}\n\n{me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 } = {4.95902 * 10\u22124 , 0.104688, 1.78002}\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0.0006072 0.005543 0.01604\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n|M| = \uf8ec 0.001143 0.03729 0.2536 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0.01666 0.4850 1.696\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n0.5492 \u22122.288 1.186\n1.268 0.4201 0.3330\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1 = \uf8ec0.1955 0.2316 0.4316\uf8f7 , \u03c6 = \uf8ec0.04108 \u22121.505 \u22121.032\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u22121.560 2.667\n0\n0.5200 0.5493 0.5265\n\n[1] C.
