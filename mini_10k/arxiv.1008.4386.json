Introduction\nBranching Brownian Motion (BBM for short) is a continuous-time Markov branching\nprocess which is constructed as follows: a single particle performs a standard Brownian\nMotion x issued on some probability space (\u03a9, F , P) with x(0) = 0, which it continues\nfor an exponential holding time T independent of x, with P [T > t] = e \u2212t . At time T ,\nthe particle splits independently of x and T into k offsprings with probability pk , where\nP\u221e\nP\u221e\ndef P\nkp\n=\n2,\nand\nK\n=\np\n=\n1,\nk\nk\nk k(k \u2212 1)pk < \u221e. These particles continue\nk=1\nk=1\nalong independent Brownian paths starting at x(T ), and are subject to the same splitting\nrule, with the effect that the resulting tree X contains, after an elapsed time t > 0, a\nrandom number, n(t), of particles located at x1 (t), . . . , xn(t) (t). Clearly, En(t) = et . With\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndef\nu(t, x) = P max xk (t) \u2264 x ,\n(1.1)\n1\u2264k\u2264n(t)\n\na standard renewal argument, first observed by McKean [23], shows that u(t, x) solves the\nKolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov or Fisher (F-KPP) equation,\n\u221e\n\nX\n1\nut = uxx +\npk uk \u2212 u,\n2\nk=1\n(\n1, if x \u2265 0,\nu(0, x) =\n0, if x < 0.\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe F-KPP equation is arguably one of the simplest p.d.e. that admits traveling wave\nsolutions. It is well known that there exists a unique solution satisfying\n\u0001\nu t, m(t) + x \u2192 \u03c9(x),\nuniformly in x, as t \u2192 \u221e,\n(1.3)\n\nwith the centering term, the front of the wave, given by\n\u221a\n3\nm(t) = 2t \u2212 \u221a log t,\n2 2\n\n(1.4)\n\nand \u03c9(x) the unique (up to translation) distribution function which solves the o.d.e.\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c9xx + 2\u03c9x + \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9 = 0.\n(1.5)\n2\nThe leading order of the front has been established through purely analytic means by Kolmogorov, Petrovsky and Piscounov [20]. The far more delicate issue of the logarithmic\ncorrections has been settled by Bramson [8], who exploited the probabilistic interpretation\nof the F-KPP equation in terms of BBM. Both F-KPP equation and BBM have attracted\na great deal of interest ever since: the reader is referred to the very partial list [1, 2, 14, 15]\nfor results of analytical flavor, and to [3, 13, 18, 19, 21, 24] for more probability-oriented\nwork.\nThe large time asymptotic of the maximal displacement of BBM is a paradigm for the\nbehavior of extrema of random fields, which is a classical problem in probability theory.\nIn the case of BBM, the correlations among particles are given in terms of the genealogical\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n3\n\ndef\n\ndistance: for i, j \u2208 \u03a3t = {1, . . . , n(t)} and conditionally upon the branching mechanism,\nit holds\nE [xi (t) * xj (t)] = Qt (i, j),\n\n(1.6)\n\ndef\n\nwhere Qt (i, j) = sup{s \u2264 t : xi (s) = xj (s)} is the time to first branching. (In spin glass\nterminology, Qt (i, j) is the overlap between configuration i and j). Since Qt can take any\nvalue in [0, t], one might expect that the maximal displacement of BBM lies considerably\nlower than in the independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) setting. Somewhat surprisingly, this is not the case: to leading order, it coincides with that of \u230a e t \u230b independent\ncentered Gaussians of variance t, in which case the correct centering is well known to be\n1\ndef \u221a\nr(t) = 2t \u2212 \u221a log t.\n(1.7)\n2 2\nWe will refer henceforth to the Gaussian i.i.d. setting as the Random Energy Model of\nDerrida, or REM for short [12]. The law of the maximum of a REM\u0010is known \u0011to belong\n\u221a\ndef\nto the domain of attraction of the Gumbel distribution, G(x) = exp \u2212 e \u2212 2x , see e.g.\n[22]. Although BBM does not belong to this universality class (it is straightforward to\ncheck that G does not solve (1.5)), the distribution of its maximum is still Gumbel-like.\nIndeed, denoting by\ndef\n\nZ(t) =\n\nn(t) \u0010\nX\n\u221a\nk=1\n\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\u221a\n2t \u2212 xk (t) exp \u2212 2\n2t \u2212 xk (t)\n\u0011\n\n(1.8)\n\nthe so-called derivative martingale, Lalley & Sellke [21] proved that Z(t) converges weakly\nto a strictly positive random variable Z, and established the integral representation\nh\n\u221a i\n\u2212 2x\n(1.9)\n\u03c9(x) = E e \u2212CZ e\n\n(for some C > 0). This exposes the law of the maximum of BBM as a random shift of\nthe Gumbel distribution.\nIt is also known that the limiting derivative martingale has infinite mean, E[Z] = +\u221e.\nThis affects the asymptotics to the right to the extent that\n1 \u2212 \u03c9(x) \u223c x e \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n2x\n\n,\n\nx \u2192 +\u221e,\n\n(1.10)\n\nwith \u223c meaning that the ratio of the terms converges to a positive constant in the considered limit (see e.g. Bramson [9] and Harris [18]). Tails of the form (1.10) have recently\nstarted to appear in different fields, see e.g. the studies on Spin Glasses with logarithmic correlated potentials [16, 11]; there is thus strong evidence for the existence\nof a\n\u221a\n\u2212 2x\nfor\nnew universality class different from the Gumbel (which has tail 1 \u2212 G(x) \u223c e\nx \u2192 +\u221e).\nContrary to the statistics of the maximal displacement, nothing is known on a rigorous\nlevel about the full statistics of the extremal configurations (first-, second-, third-, etc.\nlargest) in BBM. Such a statistics is completely encoded in the extremal process, which is\nthe point process associated to the collection of points shifted by the expectation of their\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n4\n\nmaximum (lower order included), namely\ndef\n\nNt =\n\nn(t)\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b4xi (t) ,\n\ndef\n\nxi (t) = xi (t) \u2212 m(t).\n\n(1.11)\n\nIn fact, it is not even known whether Nt converges to a well defined limit at all, although\none can easily see that the collection of laws is tight, see Proposition 2.7 below. On a nonrigorous level, the situation is only slightly better, see Section 2.3 below for a discussion\nof some recent work by Brunet & Derrida [10].\nThe extremal process of the REM is well known to \u221a\nbe given in the limit of large times by\n\u2212 2x\na Poisson point process with exponential density e\nd x on R. Given the Gumbel-like\nbehavior (1.9), one may (perhaps) be tempted to conjecture that the limiting extremal\nprocess of BBM is a randomly shifted Poisson point process, but the work by Brunet &\nDerrida mentioned above provides strong evidence against this: BBM seems to belong,\nas far as statistics of extremal particles are concerned, to a new universality class, which\nis expected to describe the extrema of models \"at criticality\", such as the 2\u2212dim Gaussian free field [4], directed polymers on Cayley trees [13], or spin glasses with logarithmic\npotentials [16, 11].\nIn this work we obtain some first rigorous results on the statistics of the extremal\nparticles of BBM. Although we cannot yet characterize the limiting extremal process, a\nclear picture of BBM at the edge emerges from our analysis, which we believe will prove\nuseful for further studies.\n2. Main results\n2.1. The genealogy of extremal particles. The major difficulty in the analysis of\nthe BBM stems from the delicate dependencies among particles, which are due to the\ncontinuous branching. A first, natural step towards the extremal process is to study it at\nthe level of the Gibbs measure, which is less sensitive to correlations. The Gibbs measure\nis the random probability measure on the configuration space \u03a3t attaching to the particle\nk \u2208 \u03a3t the weight\nn(t)\n\nX\nexp \u03b2xk (t)\ndef\nG\u03b2,t (k) =\n, where Zt (\u03b2) =\nexp \u03b2xj (t),\nZt (\u03b2)\nj=1\ndef\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 > 0 is the inverse temperature. A first study of the Gibbs measure of BBM was\ncarried out by Derrida & Spohn [13]. Through comparisons with Derrida's GREM, and\nexploiting the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities introduced in the context of the SherringtonKirkpatrick model [17], Bovier & Kurkova [7] put on rigorous\n\u221a ground the findings by\nDerrida & Spohn, thereby proving in particular that, for \u03b2 > 2, the law of the normalized\ntime to first branching under the product Gibbs measure over the replicated space \u03a3t \u00d7\u03a3t\nconverges in distribution to the superposition of two delta functions,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQi,j (t)\nlim G\u03b2,t \u2297 G\u03b2,t\n\u2208 d x = co \u03b40 ( d x) + (1 \u2212 co )\u03b41 ( d x).\n(2.2)\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n5\n\nfor some \u03b2-dependent 0 < co < 1. Hence, the support of the Gibbs measure is restricted to\n\"almost uncorrelated\" particles. Since the Gibbs measure favors extremal configurations,\none may wonder whether a similar result holds true also at the level of the extremal\nprocess. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. In fact, we prove\na stronger result which concernsnthe unnormalizedotime to first branching of extremal\ndef\nparticles: denoting by \u03a3t (D) = i \u2208 \u03a3t : xi (t) \u2208 D the set of particles falling into the\nsubset m(t) + D, we have:\nTheorem 2.1 (The genealogy of extremal particles.). For any compact D \u2282 R,\nh\ni\nlim sup P \u2203i, j \u2208 \u03a3t (D) : Qt (i, j) \u2208 (r, t \u2212 r) = 0.\nr\u2192\u221e t>3r\n\n(2.3)\n\nExtremal particles thus descend from common ancestors which either branch off \"very\nearly\", i.e. in the interval (0, r), or \"very late\", i.e. in the interval (t \u2212 r, t), in the course\nof time. The proof of Theorem 2.1 is given in Section 4 and relies on results about the\nlocalization of the paths of the extremal particles which is of independent interest. Such\nresults on the localization of the paths, and the heuristics behind Theorem 2.1 are presented in Section 2.2.\nLet us remark in passing that a complete description of the genealogy for a related\nmodel, branching Brownian motion with absorption, has been recently obtained by Berestycki, Berestycki, and Schweinsberg [5]. In this model, the Brownian particles possess a\nnegative drift and are killed upon reaching zero. They show that, for a particular choice\nof the drift (for which the population is roughly of order N) and an appropriate time scale\n(of order (log N)3 ), the genealogy of uniformly sampled particles converges as N \u2192 \u221e\nto the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent. It is unlikely that the same limit holds for the\ngenealogy of extremal particles of BBM. In fact, this is suggested by Theorem 2.1, since\nit shows that the branching times are strongly concentrated on early and late times as\nopposed to the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent where all branching times can occur with\npositive density.\n\n2.2. Localization of the paths of extremal particles. Our approach towards the\ngenealogy of particles at the edge of BBM is based on characterizing, up to a certain level\nof precision, the paths of extremal particles. As a first step towards a characterization, we\nwill prove that such paths cannot fluctuate too wildly in the upward direction. In order\nto formulate this precisely, we introduce some notation. For \u03b3 > 0, we set\n(\ns\u03b3\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 2t\ndef\nft,\u03b3 (s) =\n(2.4)\n(t \u2212 s)\u03b3 2t \u2264 s \u2264 t .\nThe upper envelope at time t, denoted Ut,\u03b3 , is defined as\ndef\n\nUt,\u03b3 (s) =\nNotice that Ut,\u03b3 (t) = m(t).\n\ns\nm(t) + ft,\u03b3 (s).\nt\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n6\n\nTheorem 2.2 (Upper Envelope). Let 0 < \u03b3 < 1/2. Let also y \u2208 R, \u01eb > 0 be given. There\nexists ru = ru (\u03b3, y, \u01eb) such that for r \u2265 ru and for any t > 3r,\nh\ni\nP \u2203k \u2264 n(t) : xk (s) > y + Ut,\u03b3 (s), for some s \u2208 [r, t \u2212 r] < \u01eb .\n(2.6)\nspace\n\nThe picture emerging from Theorem 2.2 is depicted in Figure 1.\nUt,\u03b3 (s) = st m(t) + O(s\u03b3 , (t \u2212 s)\u03b3 )\n\nm(t) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2t \u2212\n\n3\n\u221a\n2 2\n\nlog t\n\ns\nm(t)\nt\n\ntime\n\nt \u2212 ru\n\nru\nt\n2\n\nt\n\nFigure 1. The upper envelope\nOur choice of the upper envelope is not optimal.\nAs was pointed out by an anonymous\n\u221a\nreferee, Lalley & Sellke [21] have shown that 2t \u2212 maxk\u2264n(t) xk (t) \u2192 +\u221e almost surely.\n(This is essentially a consequence of the convergence of the martingale Z(t).) In particular,\nthis implies that to given \u01eb > 0, and r large enough,\ni\nh\n3\nP \u2203k \u2264 n(t) : xk (s) > y + m(s) + \u221a log s, for some s > r < \u01eb .\n2 2\ns\nSince m(s) \u2264 t m(t) (for s > e), this is an improvement over (2.6), but only for s not\ntoo close to t. (For example, it holds for s \u2264 t \u2212 \u03b4(t) for \u03b4 \u223c (log t)1/\u03b3 .) For the later\ntimes, of order one away from t, a finer argument is needed. A slight refinement of the\napproach of Bramson [8] can be used to obtain an envelope where f is of logarithmic order\non the entire interval [r, t \u2212 r]. It is based on the simple observation that particles that\ntouch the upper envelope during the interval [r, t \u2212 r] would reach at that time values\nthat are so large that their offsprings at time t could easily jump to heights well above\nthe established value of the maximal displacement. We choose the upper envelope Ut,\u03b3\nsince its form is simple throughout the interval and since it requires relatively little work.\nIt steadily follows from the estimate of the right tail of the maximal displacement, as\nobtained by Bramson in [8, Prop. 3]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh \u221a i\nP max xk (t) \u2265 m(t) + Y \u2264 \u03ba(1 + Y )2 exp \u2212 2Y ,\n(2.7)\nk\u2264n(t)\n\n\u221a\nwhich is valid for 0 < Y < t and where \u03ba > 0 is a numerical constant. (Here and\nhenceforth, we denote by \u03ba a positive numerical constant, not necessarily the same at\ndifferent occurrences).\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n7\n\nThe construction of an upper envelope is very useful for the results on the genealogies,\nas we shall briefly elucidate. Remark first that correlations among particles force the\nfront of BBM to lie lower (by a logarithmic factor) than the one of the REM. This has\nconsiderable impact on the finer properties of BBM. A simple calculation reveals already\nthat something unusual is going on: to leading order in t, the mean number of exceedances\nof a level x is given by\n\u0012 2\u0013\net\nx\nE[#{i \u2264 n(t) : xi (t) > x}] \u223c \u221a\n(2.8)\nexp \u2212\n2t\n2\u03c0t\nNote that this quantity is not sensitive to correlations. For the level of the maximum\nin the REM, x = r(t), this quantity is of order one, as t \u2191 \u221e, while at the level of the\nmaximum of BBM, x = m(t), it is of order t! As a consequence, Theorem 2.1 does not\nfollow by a straigthforward application of the Markov inequality and classical Gaussian\nestimates. Theorem 2.2 is a first, fundamental step to overcome this difficulty. In fact,\nthis theorem tells us that one can additionally require that paths of extremal particles\nnever cross the upper envelope (up to an error which can be made as small as wished).\nPrecisely, extremal particles perform Brownian motion starting in zero conditioned to\nreach certain values at given times. This can be reformulated in terms of a Brownian\nbridge of length t starting at 0 and ending at m(t) (omitting lower orders) that is not\nallowed to cross the upper envelope. This idea is omnipresent in Bramson's paper [8], and\nis used extensively in the present work. By the very definition of the upper envelope, the\nsituation is equivalent to a Brownian bridge (starting and ending at time t at zero) which\nis not allowed to cross the curve ft,\u03b3 for most of its lifespan. The probability of such an\nevent is inversely proportional to the length of the bridge, and will hence compensate the\nextra t factor observed above. (In fact, the probability that the Brownian bridge remains\nbelow any concave curve such ft,\u03b3 is of the same order of magnitude as if it is required to\nstay below a straight positive line, as long as \u03b3 < 1/2.)\nA second consequence of Theorem 2.2 which plays a crucial role in the proof of Theorem\n2.1 is a phenomenon we will refer to, by a slight abuse of terminology, as entropic repulsion.\nDue to the strong fluctuations of the unconstrained paths, particles which at some point\nare close to the line s 7\u2192 st m(t) have plenty of chances to hit the upper envelope in the\nremaining time. One expects that a natural way to avoid this is for the paths to lie well\nbelow the interpolating line for most of the time. (In other words, a typical Brownian\nbridge that is conditioned to lie below the curve ft,\u03b3 for most of the interval of time must\nlie well below 0; this is not surprising in view of the fact that the conditioned Brownian\nbridge resembles a Bessel bridge [25]). This turns out to be the case, the upshot being\nthat the upper envelope identified in Theorem 2.2 can be replaced by a lower \"entropic\nenvelope\", E, under which paths of extremal particles lie with overwhelming probability.\nSuch a phenomenon is strongly reminiscent of the entropic repulsion encountered in the\nstatistical mechanics of membrane models, see e.g. Velenik's survey [29].\nTo formulate this precisely, we need some notation. With f as in (2.4) and \u03b1 > 0 we\ndenote by entropic envelope the curve\ndef s\nEt,\u03b1 (s) = m(t) \u2212 ft,\u03b1 (s).\n(2.9)\nt\nNotice that Et,\u03b1 \u226a Ut,\u03b1 .\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n8\n\nTheorem 2.3 (Entropic Repulsion).

Remark that such path-localizations evidently cannot hold true for times which\nare close to 0 or t, and this is the reason why \"very old\" resp. \"very recent\" ancestries\nare indeed not only possible, but, as we believe (see Section 2.3 below) also crucial for the\npeculiar properties of the extremal process of BBM.\n\nUt,\u03b3 (s) = st m(t) + O(s\u03b3 , (t \u2212 s)\u03b3 )\n\nm(t) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2t \u2212\n\n3\n\u221a\n2 2\n\nlog t\n\nEt,\u03b1 (s) = st m(t) \u2212 O(s\u03b1 , (t \u2212 s)\u03b1 )\n\nre\n\ntime\n\nt \u2212 re\nt\n\nFigure 2. Entropic repulsion\nRemark 2.4. Energy/entropy considerations provide a straightforward explanation of the\nmechanism underlying Theorem 2.3: at any given time s \u2208 [r, t \u2212 r] (for r large enough\nbut finite), there are simply not enough particles at heights \u2265 st m(t) \u2212 ft,\u03b1 (s) for their\noffsprings to be able to make large jumps allowing them to reach at time t the edge.\nThe entropic repulsion is a crucial ingredient in the proof of Theorem 2.1. In fact,\nconsider two extremal particles, say i and j, that reach, at time t, heights of about m(t),\nand assume that the common ancestor of these particles branched at times well inside the\ninterval [0, t]: for concreteness, assume that Qt (i, j) = t/3. By Theorem \u221a\n2.3, the common\nancestor of the particles at time t/3 lies at heights of order (at most) 2(t/3) \u2212 (t/3)\u03b1\nfor some 0 < \u03b1 < 1/2, omitting logarithmic corrections. In order for a descendant, say\nparticle i, to be on the edge at time t, the ancestor must thus produce a random\ntree\n\u221a\nof length (2/3)t where at least one particle makes the unusually high jump 2(2/3)t +\n(t/3)\u03b1 . \u221aOne can\nthis is indeed possible: there are to leading order\n\u0001 easily check that \u221a\n\u03b1\nexp + 2(t/3) particles at levels 2(t/3) \u2212 (t/3)\u03b1 , and the probability of such a big\n\u221a\n\u0001\njump in the remaining time interval is of order exp \u2212 2(t/3)\u03b1 , the product being thus\nof order one. But to have the particle j reach the same levels and overlapping for t/3\n\n\fGENEALOGY OF BRANCHING BROWNIAN PARTICLES\n\n9\n\nof its lifetime with i amounts to finding within the same tree of length (2/3)t yet a\nsecond particle which makes the unusually high jump.\nThe\nsuch\n\u221a\n\u221a of finding\n\u0001 probability\n\u0001\ntwo particles is to leading order at most exp + 2(t/3)\u03b1 exp \u22122 2(t/3)\u03b1 , which is\nvanishing in the limit of large times. Of course, this is valid only to leading order and\nfor a fixed value of the overlap, the nature of the continuous branching compounding the\ndifficulties, but the reasoning is in its essence correct. In fact, for technical reasons, we\nneed yet another piece of information about paths of extremal particles: namely that they\ncannot lie too low, which is again to be expected from an energy/entropy perspective.\nTheorem 2.5 (Lower Envelope).

As mentioned in the introduction, it is not known at the time of the writing whether the extremal\nprocess Nt of BBM converges as t \u2192 \u221e to a well defined point process. On the other\nhand, the tightness of the family (Nt )t\u22650 is not hard to establish.\nProposition 2.7 (Local Finiteness). For any y \u2208 R and \u03b5 > 0, there exists N = N(\u03b5, y)\nand t0 = t0 (\u03b5, y) such that for t \u2265 t0 ,\nP[Nt [y, \u221e) \u2265 N] < \u03b5 .\n\nIt is possible to prove the proposition using the localization of the paths described in\nthe above section. We present here a simpler and more robust proof which has been\nsuggested by an anonymous referee.\nProof. Suppose the assertion does not hold. Then it is possible to find y \u2208 R, \u01eb > 0 and\na sequence of times (tN ) such that\nP[NtN [y, \u221e) \u2265 N] \u2265 \u03b5 , uniformly in N.\n\n(2.13)\n\nOn the other hand, by the convergence of the law of the maximum (1.3), for any \u03b4 > 0,\nwe can find a\u03b4 \u2208 R independently of t such that\nlim P[max xk (t) \u2264 m(t) + a\u03b4 ] \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4 .\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nk\n\n(For example, take a\u03b4 such that \u03c9(a\u03b4 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b4.)\nNow pick \u03b4 = \u03b5/2, where \u03b5 is as in (2.13). Then it must be that, for N large enough,\nthe events\n{NtN [y, \u221e) \u2265 N} and {max xk (tN + 1) \u2264 m(tN + 1) + a\u03b5/2 }\nk\n\nhave a non-trivial intersection whose probability is bounded below by \u03b5/2 uniformly in N.\nWe show that this is impossible. The intersection is included in the event that N particles\nabove y at time tN produces an offspring at time tN + 1 whose maximum is smaller or\nequal to m(tN + 1) + a\u03b5/2 .

First, they\nshow evidence that the statistics of the gaps between the leading particles differ from those\nof the Derrida-Ruelle cascades [26], that are known to be the limiting extremal process\nof the GREM processes, as shown by Bovier & Kurkova [6]. The statistics of the gaps of\nthe cascades are the same as those of Poisson point processes with exponential density.\nFor instance, the expected distance Dt (n, n + 1) between the nth and (n + 1)th particle is\nproportional to 1/n. For the extremal process of BBM, Brunet & Derrida argue that\nlim Dt (n, n + 1) \u2243\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+ ...,\nn n log n\n\n(2.14)\n\nParticles at the edge of BBM are thus more densely packed than in Poisson processes of\nexponential density; this in particular entails that the statistics of the particles at the\nedge of BBM cannot be given by any of the cascades.\nBrunet & Derrida also conjecture that the extremal process of BBM retains properties\nof Poisson point processes with exponential density, namely the invariance under superposition: the collection of a finite number of i.i.d. copies of the process, with possibly\nrelative shifts, has the same law for the gaps as the process itself.\nAlthough we cannot prove any of the Brunet-Derrida conjectures, our results let them\nappear rather natural. In fact, Theorem 2.1 suggests the following picture for the extremal\nprocess of BBM, which is depicted in Figure 4 below.\nFirst, the result does not rule out ancestry in the interval [0, r] (in the limit of large times\nand for large enough r): this \"free evolution\" seems to naturally generate the derivative\nmartingale appearing in the work of Lalley & Sellke's [21].\nSecond, ancestry over the period [t \u2212 r, t] being also allowed, it is obvious that small\ngrapes of length at most r = O(1) (for t \u2192 \u221e), i.e. clusters of particles with very recent\ncommon ancestor, appear at the end of the time-interval. This suggests that particles at\nthe edge of BBM should be more densely packed than in the REM case, in agreement\nwith (2.14).\nFinally, since the ancestors of the extremal particles evolved independently for \"most\"\nof the time (in the interval [r, t\u2212r]), the extremal process must exhibit a structure similar\nto Poisson process with exponential density: this makes plausible the invariance under\nsuperposition of the law of the gaps proposed by Brunet & Derrida.\nIn other words, the limiting extremal process of BBM seems to be given by a certain\nrandomly shifted cluster point process. A rigorous analysis is however technically quite\ndemanding, as it must take into account the self-similarity of BBM which is responsible\n(in particular) for the onset of the small branches. Unfortunately, this issue is still elusive.\nA less ambitious but still interesting goal would be to unravel the poissonian structure\nwhich evidently hides behind the limiting extremal process. We plan to report on this in\nfuture work.\n3.
