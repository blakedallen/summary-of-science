We can define the pure\norbital limit Hc20 and the Pauli paramagnetic limit HP ,\nwhich are theoretically obtained by taking into account\nonly the orbital effect and paramagnetic\neffect, respec\u221a\ntively. The Maki parameter \u03b1 \u2261 2Hc20 /HP expresses\nthe strength ratio of the two pair-breaking effects.\nIn conventional metal superconductors, the orbital\npair-breaking effect dominates the system (Hc20 \u226a HP )\nbecause of the large Fermi velocity. Partial destruction\nof the superconductivity due to the orbital effect creates\nvortexes, which form a lattice below the upper critical\nfield, and causes the order parameter to become nonuniform.\nIn contrast, in purely Pauli limited superconductors,\nanother type of nonuniform superconductivity has been\nproposed by Fulde and Ferrell [2] and Larkin and Ovchinnikov [3]. In magnetic fields, the Fermi surfaces of the\nup- and down-spin electrons are displaced due to the Zeeman energy. If the up- and down-spin electrons on the\ndisplaced Fermi surfaces form Cooper pairs, they should\nhave a finite center-of-mass momentum. The superconducting state of such Cooper pairs is called the Fulde\u2013\nFerrell\u2013Larkin\u2013Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. It is easily\nverified that the finite center-of-mass momentum results\nin spatial modulations and nodes of the order parameter in real space. As a result, spin polarization energy\n\nis gained by the depaired electrons near the nodes, while\nthe condensation energy is lost.\nTherefore, a necessary condition for the occurrence of\nthe FFLO state is that the superconductivity survives in\nhigh fields such that \u03bce H \u223c \u22060 , for which the loss of\ncondensation energy due to modulation of the order parameter is compensated by a gain in polarization energy.\nHere, \u03bce and \u22060 denote the electron magnetic moment\nand the zero field energy gap of the superconductivity.\nThis condition can be expressed as Hc2 \u223c HP , where\nHc2 denotes the upper critical field, because HP \u223c \u22060 .\nTherefore, the orbital pair-breaking effect needs to be\nvery weak for the FFLO state to occur.\nThis is one of the reasons why the FFLO state has not\nbeen observed in conventional metal superconductors.\nGruenberg and Gunther found that the FFLO state occurs only when the Maki parameter \u03b1 is large (\u03b1 >\n\u223c 1.8) in\nisotopic superconductors [4]. Such a large Maki parameter is usually difficult to realize in alloy type II superconductors, though it is achievable in some exotic superconductors, such as organic superconductors [5], heavy\nfermion superconductors [6], and oxide superconductors,\nbecause of their narrow electron bands, large effective\nmasses, and quasi-two-dimensionality.\nBecause of the orbital pair-breaking effect, and the formation of the vortex lattice state, the dependence of the\norder parameter on the spatial coordinates perpendicular to the magnetic field is described by the superposition of the Abrikosov functions. Therefore, there may\nbe additional modulations due to the FFLO state only\nin the direction parallel to the magnetic field, as Gruenberg and Gunther have proposed [4]. We examined the\n\n\f2\ncoexistence of the vortex states with higher Landau level\nindexes n and the FFLO state in d-wave superconductors in our previous paper [7], and obtained phase diagrams for some cases. Recently, in a model of the quasitwo-dimensional heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 ,\nAdachi and Ikeda have shown that the first-order phasetransition to a coexistence state occurs taking into account the higher Landau level indexes [8].\nBulaevskii examined film superconductors at T = 0\nin tilted magnetic fields, and obtained cascade transitions between the states with different n's when the direction of the magnetic field changes. It was shown\nthat the upper critical field tends to approach that of\nthe FFLO state when the magnetic field approaches the\nparallel direction. Buzdin and Brison also obtained cascade transitions at finite temperatures in two- and threedimensional isotropic superconductors [9]. We extended\nBulaevskii's theory to finite temperatures in s- and dwave superconductors [10]. We also reproduced the cascade transitions solving the gap equation, and clarified\nthe behavior in the limit of a parallel field. We analytically demonstrated that the Landau level index n of the\nvortex state diverges in the temperatures region where\nthe FFLO state occurs in the limit. As a result, the\nenvelope of the cascade transition lines approaches the\nFFLO critical field when the field orientation approaches\nthe parallel direction. The coexistence state is continuously reduced to the pure FFLO state. We obtained a\nrelation between n and the FFLO vector q, which connects the vortex states and the FFLO state in the limit.\nThe present study extends our previous theory to the\ncoexistence state in three dimensions.\nNear critical fields, the order parameter of the pure\nFFLO state can be expressed by a linear combination\nof exponential functions exp[iqm * r], where qm are the\ndegenerate FFLO wave vectors with optimum values determined from the structures of the Fermi surfaces and\nthe pairing interactions, and the temperature. The free\nenergies of such states were compared in a three dimensional isotropic system by Larkin and Ovchinnikov [3],\nMatsuo et al. [11], Bowers and Rajagopal [12], and Mora\nand Combescot [13], and in two-dimensional systems by\nthe author [14] and Mora and Combescot [15]. Larkin\nand Ovchinnikov [3] showed that the state expressed\nby \u2206(r) \u223c cos(q * r) has a lower free energy than the\nstate \u2206(r) \u223c exp[iq * r] proposed by Fulde and Ferrell.\nThe author has shown that the square, triangular, and\nhexagonal states have lower free energies than the state\n\u2206(r) \u223c cos(q * r) at low temperatures in two dimensions [14]. Mora and Combescot have shown that the\nstates described many cosine functions have lower free\nenergies than the state \u2206(r) \u223c cos(q * r) in three dimensions when the first-order phase transition is taken into\naccount [13]. The possibility of the first-order transition\nwas addressed also by Larkin and Ovchinnikov [3].\nWhen the magnetic field is not oriented in the optimum\ndirection of q of the pure FFLO state, or when more\nthan two qm 's contribute to the linear combination for\n\nthe pure FFLO state, it may appear that the coexistence\nstate is not reduced to the pure FFLO state in the limit\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, because in the coexistence state q can have a\nnonzero component only in the direction of the magnetic\nfield. In actuality, however, the Landau level index n\nof the coexistence state diverges and the components of\nq perpendicular to the magnetic field are realized [16].\nThis behavior is analogous to that in two-dimensional\nsystems in a tilted magnetic field. In the present paper,\nwe demonstrate this behavior in quasi-two-dimensional\nsystems by an analytical proof and concrete numerical\ncalculations.\nFor simplicity, we adopt an effective mass model\nassuming that the first-order transition is suppressed,\nto demonstrate the continuity between the coexistence\nstates and the pure FFLO state. In actuality, in the effective mass model with very large \u03b1, the first-order transition would occur at a slightly higher field than that of\nthe second-order transition [13]. In this case, the secondorder transition curve below the first-order transition\ncurve is regarded as that of the metastable transition,\nwhich can be realized when the system is supercooled.\nRecently, we have obtained a result which also suggests that the Landau level index n increases with \u03b1 in\nan anisotropic Ginzburg\u2013Landau model near the tricritical point [17]. Comparing the phase diagrams with and\nwithout the orbital effect, we have found that the areas\nof the coexistence states with n > 0 in the former phase\ndiagrams correspond to the areas of the pure FFLO state\nwith q\u22a5 6= 0 in the latter phase diagrams.\nIn section 2, we present our formulation. In sections\n3 and 4, we examine the pure FFLO state and the coexistence state, respectively. In section 4, we show the\ncrossover from the pure FFLO state to the coexistence\nstate and the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. In section 5, we show the\nnumerical result for finite temperatures. In section 6, we\nsummarize and discuss the results.\n\nII.\n\nFORMULATION\n\nWe examine a model described by the Hamiltonian\nH = H 0 + Hm + H \u2032 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nH0 =\n\nXZ\n\nd3 r \u03c8\u03c3\u2020 (r)\n\n\u03bc\u03c3\n\nHm =\n\ne \u00012\n\u2202\n1\n\u2212 A\u03bc \u03c8\u03c3 (r), (2)\n\u2212i~\n2m\u03bc\n\u2202x\u03bc c\n\nXZ\n\nd3 r \u03c3h \u03c8\u03c3\u2020 (r)\u03c8\u03c3 (r),\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2032\n\nH =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd r\n\nZ\n\nd3 r \u2032 \u03c8\u2191\u2020 (r)\u03c8\u2191 (r)V (r \u2212 r \u2032 )\u03c8\u2193\u2020 (r \u2032 )\u03c8\u2193 (r \u2032 ).\n(4)\n\n\f3\nHere, we have defined the effective masses m1 = mx ,\nm2 = my , m3 = mz , Zeeman field h = \u03bce |H|, and vector potential A, where \u03bce and H denote the magnitude\nof the electron magnetic moment and the magnetic field\nH = rotA. We consider pairing interactions of the form\nV (p, p\u2032 ) = g\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b1 (p\u0302)\u03b3\u03b1 (p\u0302\u2032 ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the suffix \u03b1 expresses a symmetry.\nIn the effective mass model of Eq.

Then, the Fermi surface in p\u0303\nspace becomes spherically symmetric, and we can define a constant Fermi momentum p\u0303F and Fermi velocity\n\u1e7dF = \u1e7dF p\u0303/|p\u0303| with a constant magnitude \u1e7dF = p\u0303F /m\u0303,\nfor the scaled momentum p\u0303.\nNow, we derive the gap equation. The calculation is a\nstraightforward extension of the previous studies [7, 10,\n18, 19].

For non-s-wave pairing,\nboth the direction and the magnitude of q\u0303 are optimized.\nDepending on the symmetries of \u03b3\u03b1 (p) and the Fermi\nsurface, and the temperature, there may be 2, 4, 8, 16 * * * fold degeneracies with respect to the direction of q\u0303. We\nwrite the optimum q\u0303's as q\u0303m with m = 1, 2, * * * , M .

In contrast, for anisotropic\nsuperconductors, the mass anisotropy affects the upper\ncritical field equation through the deformation of \u03b3\u03b1 (p\u0302\u2032 )\nwhen it is expressed in p\u0303 space [19].\n\n(11)\n\nThe upper critical field Hc2 is the highest |H| among\nthose which give a nontrivial solution of \u2206(r). We note\nthat Eq. (10) is the same as that of a system with a spherically symmetric Fermi surface except that the argument\np\u0302\u2032 = p\u2032 /|p\u2032 | of \u03b3\u03b1 (p\u0302\u2032 ) is different from the integral vari\u02c6 \u2032 = p\u0303\u2032 /|p\u0303\u2032 | = p\u0303\u2032 /p\u0303F .

Every degenerate q\u0303m does\nnot necessarily appear in the linear combination of the\nphysical state. The most well-known form is that expressed by the linear combination of eiq\u0303*r\u0303 and e\u2212iq\u0303*r\u0303 ,\ni.e., \u2206(r) \u221d cos(q\u0303 * r\u0303). For the second-order transition\nand s-wave pairing, this state is the physical state in the\neffective mass model.\nHere, we note that q\u0303m are not necessarily parallel\nto the magnetic field, when the orbital effect is negligible. The number and directions of the optimum q\u0303m\nwhich contribute to the physical state also depend on\nthe structures of the Fermi surface and the pairing interactions [20, 21], and the temperature [10, 22\u201324]. In\nthe present effective mass model, since the electron dispersion becomes isotropic in p\u0303 space as seen in Eq. (13),\nthe Fermi-surface anisotropy does not remove the infinite\ndegeneracy of the optimum q\u0303m for s-wave pairing.\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\nCOEXISTENCE STATE\n\nIn this section, we take into account both the orbital\nand paramagnetic pair-breaking effects.

In\ngeneral, Abrikosov functions with different n's can be\nmixed.\nThe magnetic field |H| appears both in the Hamiltonians H0 and Hm . The field |H| which originates from\nA in H0 is responsible for the orbital effect, and appears\nin the gap equation as a dimensionless parameter am |H|\nwith the coefficient am defined by\nm\u0303\n2|e| \u0010 vF \u00112\nam \u2261 \u221a\n.\nmx my c 2\u03c0Tc(0)\n\n(29)\n\n\f5\nIn contrast, the field |H| included in the Zeeman field\nh in Hm is responsible for the Pauli paramagnetic pairbreaking effect. For this field, it is convenient to define\n(0)\nthe dimensionless parameter \u03bce |H|/(2\u03c0Tc ).

In the limit mx \u226b my , mz , we need to consider\nAbrikosov functions with infinitely large Landau level\nindex n.

(37) and (39), we\nfind that when mx \u226b my , mz , the coexistence states\n(k)\n2\n/2, 0)\n\u2206(r) \u2248 \u2206n \u03c6n (x\u0303, \u1ef9)eiq\u0303*r\u0303/~ with (n, q\u0303z ) \u2248 (q02 \u03be \u0303H\nand those with (n, q\u0303z ) = (0, \u00b1q0 ) have upper critical fields\nclose to each other.\nVI.\n\ns-WAVE PAIRING\n\nIn this section, we consider an s-wave superconductor\nas an example. Since \u03b3s (p) = 1, the gap equation (10)\nis exactly the same as that of the isotropic model except\nthat the vector potential A is scaled as Eq. (7) and the\neigenfunctions are distorted. Because the Zeeman field\nh is not scaled, in contrast to the vector potential A,\nthe Maki parameter \u03b1 changes from \u1fb1 as expressed in\nEq. (32).\nWe expand the gap equation (19) with respect to the\noperators \u03b7\u0303, and obtain the eigenfunctions\n\u2206(r) = \u2206n \u03c6(k)\nn (x\u0303, \u1ef9) exp[iq\u0303z z\u0303/~],\n\nfor a given n. If we consider that n is always finite for the\nlimit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, Eq. (43) is reduced to q\u0303z = \u00b1q0 , and the\nHc2 equation (42) is reduced to that of n = 0. Therefore,\nwhen mx is very large, states with any finite n have upper\ncritical fields very close to that of the state with n = 0\nand q\u0303z = \u00b1q0 . However, because the index n needs to\nbe optimized for each situation, it can be infinitely large.\nFor the state with infinitely large n, such that n \u221d \u03b1 \u221d\n2\n, Eq. (43) results in |q\u0303z | < q0 and q\u0303\u22a5 6= 0.\n\u03be\u0303H\nThis can be verified also by numerical calculations.\nFigure 1 shows the temperature dependences of the critical fields of states of various n. At each temperature, the\nstate with the highest critical field is physical. It is found\nthat vortex states with n = 0, 1, 2 occur depending on the\ntemperature, and that the envelope is very close to the\ncurve of the two-dimensional limit. It is also found that\n(0)\nthe wave vector q becomes nonzero below T \u2248 0.51\u00d7Tc .\nFigure 2 shows the behavior of the critical field for each\nn at low temperatures. We obtain qz 6= 0 below the temperature where the solid and dotted curves branch off.\n(0)\nInterestingly, below T \u2248 0.18 \u00d7 Tc , the upper critical\nfield of the coexistence state with n = 2 and q\u0303z 6= 0 exceeds that in the limit zm \u2192 \u221e.

When\nH k [0, 0, 1], the effective Maki parameter \u03b1 is proportional to (mx my /m2z )1/6 . Therefore, when mx \u226b mz ,\nthe orbital pair-breaking effect becomes weak, and the\nsuperconductivity survives up to a higher field, where\nthe FFLO state is favored.\nIn the coexistence state, the FFLO modulation occurs\nin the direction of the magnetic field, and is smoothly\nreduced to that of the pure FFLO state in the twodimensional limit (mx /mz \u2192 0), when the directions of\nthe magnetic field and q of the pure FFLO state coincide. In contrast, when their directions differ, it may\nappear that the coexistence state is not reduced to the\npure FFLO state continuously. However, in actuality,\nmodulation perpendicular to the magnetic field is realized in large n vortex states. The physical origin of\nthe order parameter modulation in vortex states with\nhigher Landau levels is the spin polarization energy as in\nthe pure FFLO state. The coexistence states with optimum n have upper critical fields close to that of the pure\nFFLO state. Hence, a cascade transition occurs when\n\u03b1 is large, analogously to the exactly two-dimensional\nsystem in a tilted magnetic field [9, 10, 25\u201329]. In the\ntwo-dimensional limit mx \u2192 \u221e, the Landau level index\n1/6\nn increases as n \u221d \u03b1 \u221d mx . As a result, the coexistence\nstate indexed by (n, qk ) (or the pure vortex state indexed\nby n when qk = 0) is continuously reduced to the pure\nFFLO state with q = (qk , q\u22a5 ).\nThe relations (37) and (39) connect the coexistence\nstates of Eq. (41) and the pure FFLO state in the twodimensional limit. The pure FFLO state with q\u22a5 6= 0\ncorresponds to the coexistence state with n \u221d \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e,\nand the upper critical fields of the coexistence states converges to that of the pure FFLO state. This behavior has\n\n\f8\nbeen confirmed also by numerical calculations.\nFrom these results, we can conclude that the FFLO\nstate obtained in a theoretical model without orbital effects may emerge as the vortex states with higher Landau\n\nlevel indexes in real materials where orbital effects are inevitable. In particular, the order parameter modulation\ndue to the higher Landau level index is a mark of the\nFFLO modulation perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\n[1] B.S. Chandrasekhar, Apply. Phys.
