While the equilibrium fluctuation probability is determined by the Boltzmann distribution, there is no similar general principle away from equilibrium. The underlying reason is the absence of time reversal symmetry between the relaxation and excitation dynamics in\nout-of-equilibrium systems. As a consequence, the most\nprobable fluctuation path is not determined by the relaxation trajectory of the underlying deterministic system.\nAn important class of stochastic non-equilibrium systems is reaction kinetics, or birth-death, systems [2].\nRather than being caused by external factors, the noise\nin these systems is intrinsic, as it originates from discreteness of the reacting agents and random character of\ntheir interactions. When the typical number of agents\nis large, the Fokker-Planck (FP) approximation to the\nmaster equation, see e.g. Ref. [2], can accurately describe small deviations from the probability distribution\nmaxima. It fails, however, in determining the probability\nof large fluctuations [3, 4, 5]. Therefore, developing adequate theoretical tools for dealing with large fluctuations\nis an important task.\nOne of the areas where the birth-death models have\nbeen very successful is mathematical epidemiology, see\nRefs. [6]. In this Letter we consider two closely related models of spread of disease in a population. Although they have served as standard multi-population\nepidemiological models, the analysis of large fluctuations\nin each of these models has not been satisfactory. We will\nuse the two models as prototypical examples of multidimensional stochastic non-equilibrium systems.\nObserving the dynamics of a disease in a finite population, one notices the remarkable phenomenon of extinction of the disease in a finite time. The expected time\nto extinction (and the possibility to affect it) is of great\npractical interest. Here we develop an efficient theoretical\napproach capable of computing, among other things, this\nquantity. The approach employs the probability generating function formalism in conjunction with the eikonal\n\napproximation. In this way the problem is reduced to the\ndynamics of an effective classical Hamiltonian system.\nThe intrinsic-noise-induced extinction of the disease proceeds, with a high probability, along the optimal path:\na special (heteroclinic) trajectory in the phase space of\nthe classical Hamiltonian flow. An additional challenge\nof this type of problems is in the fact that the emerging\nmulti-dimensional Hamiltonian flows are generally nonintegrable. We compute the optimal path, and the mean\nextinction time of the disease, numerically and also obtain analytical results close to a bifurcation point.\nModel. Let us consider two stochastic epidemiological models: the endemic SI model and the endemic SIR\nmodel. In the SI model the host population is divided\ninto two dynamic sub-populations: Susceptible (S) and\nInfected (I). The model is specified by the set of reactions and their rates given in Table 1. We can always\nrepresent the renewal rate (an independent parameter of\nthe model) as \u03bcN , where N scales as the total population size in a steady state. Taking \u03bcI > \u03bc, one allows an\nincreased death rate of the infected.\nEvent\nInfection\nRenewal of susceptible\nDeath of susceptible\nDeath of infected\n\nType of transition\nS \u2192 S \u2212 1, I \u2192 I + 1\nS \u2192S+1\nS \u2192S\u22121\nI \u2192I\u22121\n\nRate\n(\u03b2/N )SI\n\u03bcN\n\u03bcS\n\u03bcI I\n\nTABLE I: Transition rates for the stochastic SI model\n\nThe endemic SIR model deals, in addition to the Sand I-sub-populations, with a third sub-population: Recovered (R), with the recovery rate \u03b3I. It is assumed that\nthe recovered cannot become susceptible. The death rate\nof the recovered is \u03bcR R. The endemic SIR model (which\ngeneralizes the original SIR model: the one without renewal and death) gives a satisfactory description to the\nspread of measles, mumps and rubella [6].\nLet us briefly review the deterministic, or mean-field\n\n\f2\nversion of the SIR model:\n\u1e60 = \u03bcN \u2212 \u03bcS \u2212 (\u03b2/N )S I ,\nI \u0307 = \u2212\u03bcI I \u2212 \u03b3I + (\u03b2/N )S I ,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\u1e58 = \u2212\u03bcR R + \u03b3I .\n\n(3)\n\nAs the dynamics of S and I decouples from that of R,\nthe SIR model is effectively two-population, and we will\nnot deal with the R-dynamics. Furthermore, one immediately notices that, by putting \u03bcI + \u03b3 = \u0393, the S- and\nI-dynamics in the SIR model becomes identical to that\nin the SI model, up to interchange of \u03bcI and \u0393. This also\nholds for the stochastic versions of the two models, and\nso we can treat them on equal footing, using \u0393 for the\neffective death rate constant of infected.\nFor a sufficiently high infection rate, \u03b2 > \u0393, there is\nan attracting fixed point\nS\u0304 =\n\n\u0393\nN,\n\u03b2\n\n\u03bc(\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393)\nI \u0304 =\nN\n\u03b2\u0393\n\n(4)\n\nwhich describes an endemic infection level, and an unstable fixed point S\u0304 = N, I \u0304 = 0 which describes an uninfected population. At \u03bc < 4 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393)(\u0393/\u03b2)2 the attracting\nfixed point is a stable focus, while in the opposite case\nit is a stable node. The inverse of the real part of the\neigenvalues (for the focus), or the inverse of the smaller\nof the eigenvalues (for the node) yields the characteristic\nrelaxation time \u03c4r towards the \"endemic point\".\nThe stochastic formulation of the SI and SIR models accounts for the demographic stochasticity and random character of contacts between the susceptible and infected. The master equation for the probability Pn,m (t)\nof finding n susceptible and m infected individuals has\nthe form\n\u1e56n,m = \u03bc [N (Pn\u22121,m \u2212 Pn,m ) + (n + 1)Pn+1,m \u2212 nPn,m ]\n+ \u0393 [(m + 1)Pn,m+1 \u2212 mPn,m ]\n+ (\u03b2/N ) [(n + 1)(m \u2212 1)Pn+1,m\u22121 \u2212 nmPn,m ] , (5)\nand the total population size is fluctuating in time. We\nwill be interested in the regime where the fluctuations are\nrelatively weak. In this case, after the relaxation time\n\u03c4r a long-lived (quasi-stationary) distribution is formed\nthat has a bi-variate gaussian peak with relative width\n\u223c N \u22121/2 around the stable state (4) of the mean-field description [7, 8, 9]. The long-time behavior of the stochastic model is quite remarkable: due to a rare sequence of\ndiscrete events the disease goes extinct in a finite time.\nGiven that a major outbreak of the disease occurred,\nwhat is the mean extinction time \u03c4 of the disease? For\nthe endemic SIR model this question was addressed previously [7, 8] in the framework of the van Kampen system size expansion that brings about the approximate\nFP equation [2]. Our approach considerably (exponentially) improves on these earlier results. In the regime we\nare interested in \u03c4 is exponentially large compared with\n\nthe relaxation time \u03c4r . The presence of the large parameter facilitates the use of the eikonal approximation:\neither directly in the master equation, as suggested by\nDykman et al. [10], or in the evolution equation for the\nprobability generating function, as suggested by Elgart\nand Kamenev [4].\nProbability generation function and eikonal approximation. We adopt the latter approach and introduce\ngenerating function G(pS , pI , t) =\nP\u221e the nprobability\nm\np\np\nP\n(t).\nOnce G(pS , pI , t) is found, the\nn,m\nn,m=0 S I\nprobabilities Pn,m (t) are given by the coefficients of its\nTaylor expansion around pS = pI = 0. Using the master equation (5), we obtain an evolution equation for G:\n\u2202t G = \u0124G with the effective Hamiltonian operator\n\u0124 = \u03bc(pS \u2212 1)(N \u2212 \u2202pS ) \u2212 \u0393(pI \u2212 1)\u2202pI\n\u2212 (\u03b2/N )(pS \u2212 pI )pI \u2202p2S pI .\n\n(6)\n\nIn contrast to the FP equation this equation is exact [11].\nThe eikonal ansatz is G(pS , pI , t) = exp[\u2212S(pS , pI , t)],\nwhere S \u226b 1. Neglecting the second derivatives of S\nwith respect to pS and pI , we arrive at a Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation \u2202t S + H = 0 in the p-space with the classical\nHamiltonian H(S, I, pS , pI ):\nH = \u03bc(pS \u22121)(N \u2212S)\u2212\u0393(pI \u22121)I \u2212(\u03b2/N )(pS \u2212pI )pI SI ,\n(7)\nwhere S = \u2212\u2202pS S and I = \u2212\u2202pI S. The structure of fourdimensional (4D) phase space, defined by the Hamiltonian (7), provides a fascinating and instructive insight\ninto the disease extinction dynamics. As H does not\ndepend explicitly on time, it is an integral of motion:\nH(S, I, pS , pI ) = E = const. All the mean-field trajectories, described by Eqs. (1) and (2), lie in the zero-energy,\nE = 0, two-dimensional plane pS = pI = 1. The attracting fixed point (4) of the mean-field theory becomes\n \u0304 1, 1] in the 4D phase space\na hyperbolic point A = [S\u0304, I,\nwith two stable and two unstable eigenvalues (the sum of\nwhich is zero) and respective eigenvectors. There are two\nmore zero-energy fixed points in the system: the point\nC = [N, 0, 1, 1] which is present in the mean-field description and the non-mean-field point B = [N, 0, 1, \u0393/\u03b2]\nwhich we call fluctuational. Both of them are hyperbolic and describe extinction of the disease. The presence of a fluctuational fixed point, related to extinction,\nis characteristic of a class of stochastic birth-death systems [4, 7, 12, 13].\nThe most probable sequence of discrete events, bringing the system from the endemic state to extinction of the\ndisease, is given by the optimal path that minimizes the\naction S [10, 14]. The optimal path must be a zero-energy\nheteroclinic trajectory. This trajectory exits, at t = \u2212\u221e,\nthe \"endemic\" point A along its two-dimensional unstable manifold and enters, at t = \u221e, the fluctuational disease extinction point B, along its two-dimensional stable manifold. As in one-dimensional birth-death systems\n[4, 12], one can show that there is no trajectory going\n\n\f3\ndirectly from A to C. Therefore, the fluctuational extinction point B, not present in the mean-field dynamics,\nplays a crucial role in the disease extinction.\nUp to a pre-exponent, the mean extinction time of the\ndisease is \u03c4 \u221d \u03c4r exp(S0 ) [15], where\nZ \u221e\n \u0307 dt ,\n(8)\n(pS \u1e60 + pI I)\nS0 =\n\nA\nA\n\nB\n\nB,C\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nrespectively.\nOptimal path and action: numerical examples. We\ncomputed the optimal path numerically for different parameters. To find the optimal path one needs to adjust\na single shooting parameter: the angle between two unstable eigendirections of the endemic fixed point A. Two\ntypical examples of numerically computed optimal paths\nare shown in Figs. 1 and 2 [where 4K\u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b4)2 > 1, and\nthe endemic point is a focus] and in Figs. 3 and 4 [where\n4K\u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03b4)2 < 1, and the endemic point is a node]. Figures 1a and 3a show projections of the optimal paths\non the (x, y) plane. For comparison, they also show the\nmean-field trajectories (px = py = 0) originating in the\nvicinity of the no-disease point x = y = 0, describing an\nepidemic outbreak and approaching the endemic point.\nIn contrast to equilibrium systems, the optimal path of\na large fluctuation is different from the corresponding\nrelaxation path. Notice that, although for K = 20 the\nextinction proceeds along a spiral, the difference between\nthe two spirals is striking. Figures 1b and 3b show projections of the optimal paths on the (px , py ) plane. The\noptimal paths are presented in more detail in Figs. 2 and\n4, where the time dependences of x, y, px and py are\nshown. The rescaled action along the optimal path in this\nexamples is \u03c3 \u2243 6.12\u00d710\u22123 for K = 20 and \u03c3 \u2243 0.145 for\nK = 1.8, providing sharp estimates to the logarithm of\nthe corresponding mean extinction times of the disease.\nOptimal path and action: asymptotic theory in the\nvicinity of the bifurcation point.

As in any generic multi-dimensional\nHamiltonian system, the optimal path can be computed\nonly numerically. In the following we present two typical examples of such computation, and also consider an\nimportant limit when the computation can be performed\nanalytically, by exploiting time scale separation. First we\nintroduce new coordinates x = S/N \u2212 1 and y = I/N ,\ntime t\u0303 = \u03bct, momenta px,y = pS,I \u2212 1 and bifurcation\nparameter \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 \u0393/\u03b2, 0 < \u03b4 < 1. The action (8) can\nnow be rewritten as S0 = N \u03c3, where \u03c3(K, \u03b4) is the action\nalong the optimal path, generated by the Hamiltonian\n\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n0\n\nHdL\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nt\n\nFIG. 2: Optimal path for K = 20 and \u03b4 = 0.5.

Let\nus introduce rescaled variables: q1 = x/\u03b4, q2 = yK/\u03b4,\np1 = px /\u03b4 2 , and p2 = py /\u03b4. This rescaling is motivated\nby the values of the coordinates of the fixed points, and\nreflects the important feature that, at \u03b4 \u226a 1, the fluctuations in the number of susceptible are much weaker\nthan the fluctuations in the number of infected. Neglecting higher order terms in \u03b4, we arrive at the following\napproximate equations of motion:\nq\u03071 = \u2212q1 \u2212 q2 ,\n\u1e571 = p1 \u2212 q2 p2 ,\n\nq\u03072 = K\u03b4 q2 (1 + q1 + 2p2 ) ,\n(10)\n\u1e572 = K\u03b4 (p1 \u2212 p2 \u2212 p22 \u2212 q1 p2 ) .\n\nThe fixed points become A = [\u22121, 1, 0, 0], B =\n[0, 0, 0, \u22121], and C = [0, 0, 0, 0]. For K\u03b4 \u226a 1 the subsystem (q1 , p1 ) is fast, whereas (q2 , p2 ) is slow. On the\nfast time scale (that is, the time scale \u03bc\u22121 in the original,\ndimensional variables) the fast subsystem approaches the\nstate q1 \u2243 \u2212q2 and p1 \u2243 q2 p2 which then slowly evolves\naccording to the equations\nq\u03072 \u2243 K\u03b4 q2 (1\u2212q2 +2p2 ) , \u1e572 \u2243 K\u03b4 p2 (2q2 \u22121\u2212p2 ) (11)\nthat are Hamiltonian, as they follow from the reduced\nHamiltonian Hr (q2 , p2 ) = K\u03b4 q2 p2 (1 \u2212 q2 + p2 ).

The optimal extinction path goes along the zeroenergy trajectory 1 \u2212 q2 + p2 = 0 [16]. Evaluating the\naction (8) along this line, we find in the leading order:\n\u0002\n\u0003R0\nS0 \u2243 N \u03b4 3 /(K\u03b4) 1 p2 dq2 = N \u03b4 2 /(2K). For the mean\nextinction time of the disease we obtain\n2\n\nln(\u03c4 )/N \u2243 \u03b4 2 /(2K) = [\u03bc/(2\u03b2)] (1 \u2212 \u0393/\u03b2) ;\n\n(12)\n\nthis asymptote is valid when S0 \u226b 1.\nDykman et al. [13] have recently shown that reduced\nHamiltonian dynamics of the same type as Eqs. (11)\nholds, close to the bifurcation point, in the endemic SIS\nmodel: still another two-population stochastic epidemic\nmodel where the infected individuals again become susceptible upon recovery.\nIn summary, we have developed the eikonal theory for\nstochastic multi-population birth-death systems. The\ntheory is especially suitable for analysis of large fluctuations, such as disease extinction. For the SI and SIR\nmodels we have found the optimal path to extinction of\nthe disease and the mean extinction time. The optimal\npath to extinction, including its remarkable oscillatory\nbehavior, is not model-specific. It should be observable\nin stochastic simulations of a broad class of models, and\nin real data on fade out, of infectious diseases in small\ncommunities.\nWe are very grateful to M.
