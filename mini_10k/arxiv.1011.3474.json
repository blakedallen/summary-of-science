In numerous papers (see\ne.g. the latest reviews [1\u20138], books [9\u201311] and citing\ntherein) the physical, cosmological and astrophysical aspects of dark energy are elucidated. But the main question \"which field from the large number of candidates is\npreferable in the light of obtained up to now observational\ndata?\" remains without answer. The \"goodness of fit\"\nof many of them, which are quite different, for the same\ndataset is so close that the problem of principal distinguishability of scalar field models of dark energy arises.\nIn the paper we analyze this problem for the subclass of\nminimally coupled dynamical scalar fields.\nIn the fluid approach the minimal number of dark energy parameters required for description of the dynamical and clustering properties of a scalar field is three:\nthe current density parameter \u03a9de , equation of state\n(EoS) parameter w and effective sound speed c2s . They\nin the general case are functions of the scale factor a\n(or redshift z = a\u22121 \u2212 1). The last function can be\ndeduced from scalar field Lagrangian when it is given.\nThe function w(a) usually is defined ad hoc. At the current level of possibility of constraining the dark energy\nparameters by observations the simplest linear function\nw(a) = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a) [13, 14] is widely used. Two constants w0 and wa (present values of w and its first derivative with respect to the scale factor with opposite sign)\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: novos@astro.franko.lviv.ua\naddress: olka@astro.franko.lviv.ua\n\u2021 Electronic address: apus@astro.franko.lviv.ua\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nare determined together with density parameter \u03a9de and\nother cosmological parameters, the minimal set of which\ncontains six ones: density parameter of baryons \u03c9b , density parameter of cold dark matter \u03c9cdm , Hubble constant\nH0 , spectral index of initial matter density power spectrum ns (scalar mode), amplitude of initial matter density power spectrum As and reionization optical depth\n\u03c4rei . The current observational data on Supernovae type\nIa light curves, CMB anisotropy and large scale structure\nof the Universe allow the possibility to determine most\nof them with high accuracy. The exception is parameter wa : its uncertainty is so large, that the character of\nvariation of EoS parameter \u2013 increasing or decreasing \u2013\nis not recognized (see, for example, [15\u201317]).\nIn the paper [18] we have determined the parameters of scalar field models of dynamical dark energy\nwith the other parametrization of EoS, which follows\nfrom assumption that the temporal derivative of dark\nenergy pressure is proportional to the temporal derivative of its energy density. This parametrization involves two free parameter w0 and we , which are the values of EoS parameter at current and early epochs respectively. The mean likelihood distribution obtained\nby the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method\nfor the available dataset on CMB anisotropy, power\nspectrum of spatial inhomogeneities in distribution of\ngalaxies and SN Ia photometric curves has two peaks\nwith corresponding sets of best fitting parameters pi =\n(\u03a9de , w0 , we , \u03c9b , \u03c9cdm , H0 , ns , As , \u03c4rei ), i = 1, 2 (Table I). The first of them corresponds to the scalar field\nmodel with decreasing EoS parameter, the second one\nto the scalar field model with increasing EoS parameter.\nSince the \u2212 log L's for both p1 and p2 are close, we have\nconcluded that these models are indistinguishable by the\nused dataset. This situation is the same for both classical\nand tachyonic scalar fields. Moreover, they are indistinguishable too.\n\n\f2\nIn this paper we analyze the quantitative differences of\nthis four models of dark energy \u2013 classical and tachyonic\nscalar fields, each with p1 and p2 parameter sets, and\ndiscuss the possibility of their distinguishing in the light\nof available and expected observational data.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we\ndiscuss the scalar field models of dark energy and determination of their parameters. Section III is devoted\nto the analysis of background dynamics in the models\nwith increasing and decreasing EoS parameters of scalar\nfield and diferences of SN Ia light curves. In Section\nIV the differences of matter density and CMB temperature fluctuations power spectra of all models are analyzed\nand compared with corresponding observational uncertainties. Section V summarizes the results of analyses\nand presents the conclusions.\n\nwhere a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the\nscale factor a. It has the analytic solution:\nw(a) =\n\n(1 + we )(1 + w0 )\n\u2212 1,\n1 + w0 \u2212 (w0 \u2212 we )a3(1+we )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c2a (de) we have denoted by we since it corresponds\nto the EoS parameter at the beginning of expansion\n(we = w(0)), which we call early EoS parameter. One\ncan see also that other constant value here, the integration constant w0 \u2261 w(1), is EoS parameter at the current\nepoch. The differential equation (1) with (3) has the analytic solution for \u03c1de :\n(0) (1\n\n\u03c1de (a) = \u03c1de\n\n+ w0 )a\u22123(1+we ) + we \u2212 w0\n,\n1 + we\n\n(4)\n\n(0)\n\nII.\n\nMODELS\n\nWe analyze the dynamics of expansion and the large\nscale structure formation of the spatially flat Universe\nfilled with the non-relativistic particles (cold dark matter\nand baryons), relativistic ones (thermal electromagnetic\nradiation and massless neutrino) and minimally coupled\nscalar field with given Lagrangian. We apply Einstein\nequations in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nmetric for background dynamics and Einstein-Boltzmann\nsystem of equations in the synchronous gauge for the evolution of linear perturbations. The line-element of FRW\nmetric is ds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)d\u03c3 2 , where d\u03c3 2 is timeindependent Euclidian metric of 3-space and a(t) is the\nscale factor, which we normalize to 1 at current epoch\nt0 : a(t0 ) = 1. Below we put the speed of light equal to 1\n(c = 1), therefore the time has the dimension of a length,\nthe Hubble constant of an inverse length, the mass has\ndimension of energy, velocity is dimensionless and so on.\nWhen Hubble constant appears in the traditional dimension of [km/(s*Mpc)] the speed of light appears in [km/s].\n\nA.\n\nScalar field models\n\nThe next specification of the scalar field model is used:\nits equation of state is Pde (a) = w(a)\u03c1de (a) and the temporal derivative of the dark energy pressure is proportional to the temporal derivative of its energy density,\n\u1e56de = c2a (de) \u03c1\u0307de , where the coefficient c2a (de) , often called\n\"adiabatic sound speed\", is constant. The last condition\ntogether with the differential energy-momentum conservation law, which in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmetric is\na\u03c1\u2032de = \u22123(1 + w(a))\u03c1de ,\n\n(1)\n\ngives the ordinary differential equation for w(a):\naw\u2032 = 3(1 + w)(w \u2212 c2a (de) ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1de = 3H02 \u03a9de /8\u03c0G is the dark energy density at\ncurrent epoch. It is regular function of a for any values of\nw0 and we , excluding singular point a = 0 for we > \u22121.\nThe pressure of fields with parametrization (3) is regular\nfunction of a too:\n(0)\n\nPde (a) = we \u03c1de (a) + (w0 \u2212 we )\u03c1de ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is the generalized linear barotropic equation of\nstate. That is why we call such models \"the scalar field\nmodels of dark energy with barotropic equation of state\".\nFor the quintessential scalar field (we , w0 > \u22121) both\nfunctions, \u03c1de (a) and \u2212Pde (a), decrease monotonously\n(0)\nand tend to the asymptotic value (we \u2212 w0 )\u03c1de /(1 + w0 ),\nthe sign of which depends on the ratio of values of we\nand w0 . It means that Pde (a) and \u03c1de (a) can change\nthe sign at different moments of time depending on\nthe relation between we and w0 . For example, in the\ncase of quintessential scalar field (we , w0 > \u22121) with\nw0 > we the pressure changes the sign from minus\nto plus at a(P =0) = [(1 + w0 )we /(we \u2212 w0 )]1/3(1+we )\nand the density changes the sign from plus to minus at\na(\u03c1=0) = [(1 + w0 )/(we \u2212 w0 )]1/3(1+we ) . In the opposite\ncase (we > w0 ) their signs (P < 0, \u03c1 > 0) always remain\nunaltered.\nNote that substituting (3) into r.h.s. of (2) we see\nthat the sign of w\u2032 is completely determined by the\nsign of \u2212(1 + w0 )(we \u2212 w0 ). So, for quintessential field\nw(a) is monotonously decreasing (w\u2032 < 0) function when\nwe > w0 . The repulsion property of such field raises with\ntime. When we < w0 , w(a) is monotonously increasing\n(w\u2032 > 0) function. The repulsion property of the field\nin this case recedes with time. For the phantom field,\nfor which w0 < \u22121, the conditions for raising and receding repulsion properties of the field are opposite. In the\nparticular case we = w0 the EoS parameter is constant,\nw\u2032 = 0. Another particular case we = \u22121 or w0 = \u22121 is\nsimply \u039b-term (w = const = \u22121). It must be noted also,\nthat w(a) in the form (3) does not allow the phantom\ndivide (w = \u22121) crossing since in this point \u1e56de and \u03c1\u0307de\nbecome 0, but it is applicable in both ranges w > \u22121 and\nw < \u22121 separately.\n\n\f3\n\nParameters\n\np1\n\np2\n\n\u03a9de\n\n0.72+0.04\n\u22120.06\n\n0.71+0.04\n\u22120.05\n\nw0\n\n-0.93+0.13\n\u22120.07\n\n-0.99+0.16\n\u22120.01\n\nwe\n\n-0.97+0.97\n\u22120.03\n\n-0.05+0.05\n\u22120.94\n\n10\u03c9b\n\n+0.017\n0.225+0.017\n\u22120.013 0.225\u22120.012\n\n\u03c9cdm\n\n+0.010\n0.111+0.013\n\u22120.012 0.113\u22120.013\n\nH0\n\n69.2+4.2\n\u22125.1\n\n68.6+4.7\n\u22124.4\n\nns\n\n0.97+0.05\n\u22120.03\n\n0.97+0.05\n\u22120.04\n\nlog(1010 As ) 3.07+0.11\n\u22120.08\n\n3.09+0.10\n\u22120.09\n\n\u03c4rei\n\u2212 log L\n\n\b\n\n0.4\n\n\u0007\n\n0.6\n\n\u0005\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\u0001\n\n0.8\n\n\u0002\n\n0.6\n\nw0\n\n\u0003\n\n0.4\n\n\u0004\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\nFIG. 1: Two-dimensional mean likelihood distribution in the\nplane we \u2212w0 for the combined dataset WMAP7+SDSS LRG\nDR7+SN Union2+HST+BBN.

Therefore, these fields are quite different, can affect the evolution of dark matter perturbations and leave \"fingerprints\" in the large scale structure\nof the Universe, as it was shown in our previous papers\n[18, 20, 21]. The goal of this paper is the analysis of possibility of distinguishing the scalar fields with KG and\nDBI Lagrangians by available observational data.\nFor calculation of the dynamics of expansion of the\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: The power spectra of CMB temperature fluctuations (left) and matter density ones (right) for cosmological models\nwith classical and tachyonic scalar fields (CSF and TSF respectively) with two sets of the best fitting parameters from Table\nI. The corresponding observational data from WMAP7 and SDSS LRG DR7 are shown by the filled circles.\n\nUniverse, the evolution of perturbations in all components, the power spectra of matter density perturbations\nand CMB anisotropy we have used the publicly available\ncode CAMB [23, 24], modified to include the presented\nhere expressions (3), (4), (11) and equations (6)-(7).\nB.\n\nDetermination of DE and cosmological\nparameters\n\nTherefore, the scalar field model of dark energy, described in the previous subsection, involves three parameters \u03a9de , we and w0 which must be determined by\ncomparison of the calculated predictions on dynamics\nof expansion and large scale structure of the Universe\nwith corresponding observational data. Since all predictions and data are related with other components (dark\nmatter, baryons, thermal cosmic radiation) it should be\ndone jointly with other cosmological parameter. Concentrating on the analysis of possibility of determination\nof dark energy parameters we consider the cosmological\nmodel with minimal set of six parameters: density parameter of baryons \u03c9b , density parameter of cold dark\nmatter \u03c9cdm , Hubble constant H0 , spectral index of initial matter density power spectrum ns , amplitude of initial matter density power spectrum As and reionization\noptical depth \u03c4rei . So, we have nine unknown parameters, but the number of independent ones is eight, since\nwe have assumed the spatial flatness of the Universe.\nIndeed, the dark energy density parameter \u03a9de in this\ncase can be calculated from the zero curvature condition:\n\u03a9de = 1 \u2212 \u03a9b \u2212 \u03a9cdm , where \u03a9b = \u03c9b h2 , \u03a9cdm = \u03c9cdm h2 ,\nwhere h \u2261 H0 /100km/s * Mpc.\nTo determine the best fitting values and confidential\nranges of the scalar field parameters together with other\ncosmological ones in our previous work [18] we have performed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis\nfor the set of current observational data, which include\nthe power spectra from WMAP7 [25, 26] and SDSS DR7\n\n[27], the Hubble constant measurements [28], the light\ncurves of SN Ia [29] and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nprior [30].\nWe have used the publicly available package CosmoMC\n[32, 33], which includes the code CAMB [23, 24] for calculation of the model predictions for sampled sets of 8\ncosmological parameters: we , w0 , \u03c9b , \u03c9cdm , H0 , ns , As\nand \u03c4rei . The CosmoMC code has been modified to be\nrun with the proposed here parametrization of dark energy EoS parameter (3). The flat priors \u22121 < w0 , c2a \u2264 0\nhave been used to take into account the quintessential\nproperties of scalar fields with KG and DBI Lagrangians\n(lower limit) and the constraints following from observational data related to the recombination and nucleosynthesis epochs (upper one).\nWe have performed two MCMC runs for the eightparametric flat cosmological model with the classical\nscalar field. Each run had 8 chains and the number of\nsamples in each chain was \u223c 200 000. For the first run\nwe have used only the mentioned above flat prior for we .\nThe set of best fitting parameters determined by this run\nis marked by p1 and presented in the Table I together\nwith 1\u03c3 confidential ranges. All parameters, excluding\nwe , are well constrained, the one-dimensional posterior\nand mean likelihood distributions are close and similar\nto Gaussian (half-Gaussian for w0 ), confidential ranges\nare narrow. The EoS parameter at early epoch we is essentially unconstrained: its 1\u03c3 confidence range is wide\nand coincides practically with the allowed by prior range\n[-1, 0]. The mean likelihood and posterior are different\nand the likelihood is bimodal, as it is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe first peak is close to -1, another one to 0. The best\nfitting value of we in the set p1 corresponds to the first\npeak. In this case we < w0 which means that the best\nfitting scalar field model of dark energy has receding repulsion properties (w\u2032 > 0).\nIn order to obtain the best fitting parameters corresponding to the second peak of the likelihood distribution we have performed analogical run with additional\n\n\f5\ncondition we > w0 . The set of best fitting parameters\ndetermined by this run is marked by p2 and presented\nin the Table I. Now, the best fitting value of we corresponds to the second visible in the upper left corner\nof Fig. 1 peak of mean likelihood distribution. In this\ncase we > w0 and we can say that the best fitting scalar\nfield model of dark energy has raising repulsion properties (w\u2032 < 0).\nAs we see, large variation of we does not change essentially other parameters: each parameter from the set p2\nis in the 1\u03c3 range of the corresponding one from the set\np1 and vice versa. The \u2212 log L's (last row of the Table I)\nfor both sets are very close. The power spectra of matter\ndensity perturbations and CMB temperature fluctuations\nfor both sets of the best fitting parameters p1 and p2 are\npresented in Fig. 2. For the same sets of parameters we\nhave calculated also the spectra for tachyonic scalar field\nmodels of dark energy. For all four models corresponding\nlines are superimposed and well match the observational\nspectra. Therefore, we have double degeneracy: in type\nof the dynamics of scalar field (receding-raising repulsion\nproperties) and its Lagrangian (classical-tachyonic). Is it\npossible to distinguish them in principle? It is subject of\nthe next sections.\n\nIII. DYNAMICS OF EXPANSION OF THE\nUNIVERSE, SN IA LIGHT CURVES AND\nSTATEFINDERS\n\nAt first we analyze the evolution of scalar field parameters in the homogeneous (background) Universe. The\ntime dependences of the EoS parameter and the ratio\nof scalar field energy density to dark matter density in\nthe models with best fitting parameters p1 and p2 are\npresented in Fig. 3. As we see, in spite of closeness\nof these values for both parameter sets in the current\nepoch (a = 1), they are quite different in past (a < 1)\nand future (a > 1). The EoS parameter in the model\nwith p1 increases monotonically from -0.97 at the beginning of expansion to -0.93 at the current epoch and\nwill continue increasing in future up to discontinuity of\nthe second kind, caused by the energy density crossing of\nzero (a(\u03c1de =0) = 950). Immediately after that the Universe reaches the turnaround point (ata = a(\u03c1de =0) + \u03b4a,\n\u03b4a/a \u226a 1) and begins to collapse [18]. At the early\nepoch the scalar field energy density is insignificant similarly to the cosmological constant. In the model with p2\nthe EoS parameter decreases monotonically from -0.05\nat the early epoch to -0.99 now and will asymptotically\napproach -1 in far future. The energy density in the\nearly epoch traces the density of dark matter. In future it will asymptotically approach the constant value\n(\u221e)\n(0)\n\u03c1de = \u03c1de (we \u2212 w0 )/(1 + we ). So, the future of the\nUniverse with such field is de Sitter expansion.\nThe evolution of potentials and kinetic terms of classical and tachyonic scalar fields for models with the best\nfitting parameters p1 and p2 is shown in the Fig. 4. One\n\nFIG. 3: The dependences of EoS parameter (top panel) and\nratio \u03c1de /\u03c1m (bottom panel) on the scale factor for models\nwith best fitting parameters p1 and p2 . The current epoch\ncorresponds to a = 1.\n\ncan see, that both fields are quite different for p1 and\np2 parameter sets, but for each of them the potentials of\nboth fields are similar, while kinetic terms are different.\nIn all cases scalar fields roll slowly to the minima of their\npotentials. In the models with p1 parameter set it will be\nreached in finite time (\u2248 268 Gyrs, turnaround point),\nin the models with p2 one \u2013 at infinite time. Near the\nturnaround point in the model with p1 the kinetic terms\nof both fields become dominating (top panels of Fig. 4),\nquintessential scalar fields behave as the k-essential ones.\nUsing the dependences of densities of each component on the scale factor one can deduce from the Einstein\nequations the following equations for the background dynamics:\np\nH = H0 \u03a9r /a4 + \u03a9m /a3 + \u03a9de f (a),\n(12)\n1 2\u03a9r /a4 + \u03a9m /a3 + (1 + 3w)\u03a9de f (a)\n, (13)\nq =\n2\n\u03a9r /a4 + \u03a9m /a3 + \u03a9de f( a)\nwhere f (a) = [(1 + w0 )a\u22123(1+we ) + we \u2212 w0 ]/(1 + we ),\n\u03a9m = \u03a9b +\u03a9cdm is the density parameter of matter (nonrelativistic) component at current epoch, \u03a9r = \u03a9\u03b3 + \u03a9\u03bd\nis the density parameter of relativistic component at current epoch, H \u2261 \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter (expansion\nrate) for any moment of time and q \u2261 \u2212\u00e4/aH 2 is the\nacceleration parameter for any moment of time. They\ndescribe completely the dynamics of expansion of the homogeneous isotropic Universe.\nThe temporal dependences of H and q for models with\np1 and p2 are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that their\npast evolution (a \u2264 1) is practically indistinguishable,\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 4: Evolution of potentials and kinetic terms of classical (left column) and tachyonic (right column) scalar fields for models\nwith best fitting parameters p1 (top panel) and p2 (bottom panel).\n\nbut future one is different. In both models the accelerated\nexpansion began at a \u2248 0.58. At current epoch the acceleration parameters are q0 \u2248 \u22120.57 in the model with p1\nand q0 \u2248 \u22120.52 in the model with p2 . In the last model it\nwill continue decreasing in future, approaching asymptotically -1 as in de Sitter inflation. In the model with p1 the\nacceleration parameter will reach minimal value qmin \u2248\n\u22120.87 at a(qmin ) \u2248 4.95 and then will begin to increase.\n1/3(1+we )\nAt a(q=0) = [(1 + w0 )(1 + 3we )/(we \u2212 w0 )/2]\n\u2248\n570 the accelerated expansion will be altered by decelerated one. The pressure will become positive at\n1\na(w=0) > [we (1 + w0 )/(we \u2212 w0 )] 3(1+we ) \u2248 678 and in\nfinite time according to (5) will reach the constant pos(max)\n(0)\n(0)\nitive value Pde\n= (w0 \u2212 we )\u03c1de \u2248 0.035\u03c1de causing\nthe turn around at a \u2248 960 and collapse. So, the cosmological model with p1 has future finite-time Big Crunch\nsingularity.\nFig. 5 illustrates the model degeneracy: two different\nscalar field models of dark energy are indistinguishable\nby the dynamics of expansion of the Universe. How deep\nis this degeneracy? To answer this question we have calculated the relative differences \u2206H(a)/H(a) and \u2206q/q0\nof models with p1 and p2 . The results are presented in\nFig. 6. One can see that the appreciable difference (1%)\nof H in models with p1 and p2 in the past (a < 1) appears at redshifts z > 1 (a < 0.5) and reaches 2% at\nhigh z. The relative difference of acceleration parameters in these models is maximal (\u2248 8%) at current epoch\n(a \u2248 1) and \u2248 5% at the beginning of accelerated expansion (a \u2248 0.4 \u2212 0.6).\nSince both values are usually determined from the luminosity distance-redshift relation, it is interesting to\n\ncompare the difference of distance moduli\n(m \u2212 M ) = 5 log dL + 25,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\nc\ndL =\n(1 + z)\nH0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ndz \u2032\nq\n,\n1\n\u03a9m (1 + z \u2032 )3 + \u03a9de f ( 1+z\n\u2032)\n\nfor these models with observational uncertainties of their\ndeterminations from the light curves of SN. In Fig. 7 we\npresent the distance moduli for both models and relative difference of them together with corresponding current observational data [31]. Both models match observational data on SN SDSS distance moduli equally good,\nthe difference between them does not exceed 0.1%, which\nis essentially lower than dispersion of observational points\naround of the best fitting curve. To distinguish them\nother tests based on accurate measurements of acceleration parameter in the vicinity of the Local Group should\nbe proposed or radical improvement of the accuracy of\nexisting ones should be made.\nIf in the future high-precision observations it is\npossible to measure the second derivative of H then\nstatefinder parameters r = 1 + 3\u1e22/H 2 + \u1e26/H 3 and\ns = (r \u2212 1)/[3(q \u2212 1/2)], introduced by [34], can be used\nfor distinguishing the scalar field models with different\ntime variable EoS parameters. For matter plus dark\nenergy dominated epoch they can be presented in our\nparametrization (3) as follows:\nr = 1 + 4.5(1 + w)we \u03a9de (a),\n\ns = (1 + w)we /w,\n2\n\nwhere \u03a9de (a) \u2261 8\u03c0G\u03c1de (a)/3H . Their dependences on\nscale factor a for the best fitting models p1 and p2 are\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: The dynamics of expansion of the Universe with\nbarotropic dark energy: H(a) (top panel) and q(a) (bottom\none) for the p1 and p2 models.\n\nFIG. 7: Top panel: The distance moduli (m \u2212 M )(z) for\nmodels with p1 and p2 (lines) and SN SDSS data with\ndifferent fittings of SN Ia light curves (signs).

One can see that the differences between\ns(p1 ) and s(p2 ) at high z as well as between r(p1 ) and\nr(p2 ) at low z are essentially larger than for parameters\nH and q (Fig. 5 and 6).\nIV.\n\nMATTER DENSITY AND CMB POWER\nSPECTRA\n\nLet us analyze the large scale structure and CMB\nanisotropy characteristics calculated for models with\np1 and p2 parameter sets, their differences and model\ndistinguishability in the light of them. The dark energy\n\nFIG. 8: Statefinder parameters r and s for models with p1\nand p2 .\n\naffect these characteristics via dynamics of expansion of\nthe homogeneous Universe (scale-independent growth\nfactor) and gravitational interaction between perturbations of all components for the same k-mode. The\nevolution of scalar field density perturbations depends\nalso on c2s , therefore the influence of them on the\nmatter density ones will be different for KG and DBI\nLagrangians. Using the modified CAMB code we have\nintegrated the Einstein-Boltzmann system of equations\n\n\f8\nfor all components (scalar field, dark matter, baryons,\nthermal radiation, massless active neutrinos) in the\ncosmological models with parameter sets p1 and p2 .\nThe results for baryons, cold dark matter and scalar\nfields with KG/DBI Lagrangians (wave number of\nperturbations k = 0.05 Mpc\u22121 ) are shown in Fig. 9.\nIn the case of model with p1 the evolution tracks of\nscalar field density perturbations are similar for both\nLagrangians, but they differ in the case of model with\np2 . Since scalar field density perturbations are not\nobservable, let us look how they influence the evolution\ntracks of matter density perturbations. For this purpose\nin Fig. 10 we present the differences\n\u2206\u03b4(cdm) /\u03b4(cdm) =\n\u0001\n\u03b4(cdm) (p1 ; a) \u2212 \u03b4(cdm) (p2 ; a) /\u03b4(cdm)(p1 ; a)\nfor\nKG\nand\nDBI\nscalar\nfield\nmodels\n(left panel) as well as \u0001 \u2206\u03b4(cdm) /\u03b4(cdm)\n=\n\u03b4(cdm) (CSF; a) \u2212 \u03b4(cdm) (TSF; a) /\u03b4(cdm)(CSF; a) for p1\nand p2 parameter sets (right panel). The differences\nbetween models with p1 and p2 for scalar fields with KG\nand DBI Lagrangians reach \u223c 2% at the current epoch.\nIn the case of p1 parameter set the scalar field with\nDBI Lagrangian is indistinguishable from the scalar field\nwith KG one (dashed line in right panel of Fig. 10). In\nthe case of p2 parameter set the difference between both\nfields does not exceed 0.3%. It means that at the current\nlevel of accuracy of observational data and numerical\ncodes for calculations of model predictions they cannot\nbe distinguished too. For final conclusion other k-modes\nshould be analyzed.\nFor such purpose we have calculated by the modified\nversion of CAMB the power spectra of matter density\nperturbations for the same four models P (CSF, p1 ; k),\nP (CSF, p2 ; k), P (T SF, p1 ; k) and P (T SF, p2 ; k) (right\npanel of Fig. 2). The relative differences \u2206P/P are\npresented for them in Fig. 11. The observational relative\n1\u03c3 errors of SDSS LRG DR7 data [27] are shown there\ntoo. The maximal differences between spectra in models\nwith p1 and p2 are at k \u223c 0.01 h/Mpc (\u2248 8% in the\nmodels with CSF and \u2248 6% in the models with TSF). At\nlower scales, k \u223c 0.1 h/Mpc, they are \u223c 4 \u2212 5%, that is\nlower than the observational uncertainties at this scales.\nIn the case of p1 parameter set the models with CSF\nand TSF are indistinguishable, the relative difference\nis less than 0.1%. In the case of p2 parameter set it is\nmaximal (\u2248 1.5%) at k \u223c0.01 h/Mpc, but it is \u2248 0.6%\nat k \u223c0.1 h/Mpc, where observational uncertainties\nare lowest, \u2248 6%. So, the possibility of distinguishing\nCSF from TSF by P is unpredictable. And vice versa,\ndistinguishing of the model with p1 from one with p2\nby the matter density power spectrum data expected in\nupcoming decade looks possible.\nLet us analyze now the possibility of distinguishing\nthese four models by observational data on CMB\nanisotropy. In Fig. 2 the angular power spectra of\nCMB temperature fluctuations ClT T [12] for them are\npresented in left panel. All four lines are visually\nsuperimposed and go near most points in their 1\u03c3 error\nbars. The relative differences between them \u2206ClT T /ClT T\n\nas well as relative 1\u03c3 errors of WMAP7 data [25, 26] are\nshown in Fig. 12. The maximal differences (\u223c 3 \u2212 4%)\nbetween ClT T of models with p1 and p2 are at low\nspherical harmonics, where cosmic variance is too large\nto distinguish between such models. In the range of\nacoustic peaks l \u223c 100 \u2212 700, where observational data\nare most accurate (\u223c 2%), the difference between ClT T\nof models with p1 and p2 is somewhat smaller (\u2264 1.5%).\nSo, the expected data releases on CMB anisotropy\nfrom WMAP and Planck teams would probably allow\nthe possibility to answer the question \"which scalar\nfield dark energy, with decreasing or increasing EoS\nparameter, fills our Universe?\". To answer the question\n\"which is the field Lagrangian?\" it will be harder in\nthe case of decreasing EoS parameter and practically\nimpossible in the case of increasing one (see right panels\nof Figs. 10-12).\nTo support the latter conclusions let us compare\nthe relative differences of CMB temperature fluctuations \u2206ClT T /ClT T and polarization \u2206ClEE /ClEE power\nspectra in models with both fields and parameter sets\nwith the observational uncertainties, modelled for the\nPlanck satellite in the following way. Assuming that\nthe noise part is due to the combined effect of Gaussian\nbeam and spatially uniform Gaussian white noise, for\nthe experiment with known beam width and sensitivity\nthe noise power spectrum for each channel can be\napproximated as follows:\n\"\n#\n\u03b8f2 whm\njj\n2\n2\nNl = \u03b8f whm \u03c3j exp l(l + 1)\n,\n8 log 2\nwhere j stands for either T T or EE, \u03b8f whm is the full\nwidth at half maximum of the Gaussian beam and \u03c3j\nis the root mean square of the instrumental noise. The\nnon-diagonal noise terms vanish since the noise contributions from different maps do not correlate. For the\nexperiments with more than one channel the total noise\npower spectrum is obtained as:\n1\njj(tot)\nNl\n\n=\n\nnX\nchan\n\n1\n\njj(i)\ni=1 Nl\n\n,\n\nwhere nchan is the number of channels. The described\nprocedure was proposed by [38] and implemented in their\ncode FuturCMB [39], which we use here.\nIn Fig. 13 we show the estimated errors for the Planck\nexperiment with 3 channels (for each of them \u03b8f whm , \u03c3T\nand \u03c3E are 9.5 arcmin, 6.8 \u03bcK per pixel and 10.9 \u03bcK\nper pixel; 7.1 arcmin, 6.0 \u03bcK per pixel and 11.4 \u03bcK per\npixel; 5.0 arcmin, 13.1 \u03bcK per pixel and 26.7 \u03bcK per\npixel correspondingly). The observed sky fraction is assumed to be fsky = 0.65. The models with the same\nfields but different parameter sets p1 and p2 can be distinguished by the data with such precision. For the CMB\ntemperature fluctuations power spectrum the difference\nbetween studied models exceeds the estimated error level\nat high spherical harmonics, while for the polarization\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 9: Evolution of linear density perturbations of cold dark matter (dash-dotted line), baryons (dotted) and scalar field\n(solid) for models with p1 and p2 .

Moreover, the degeneracy between them limits strongly the possibility to test whether\nw is constant or not. Our results, presented in the Tab.\n2 of [18], confirm that. We have used the set of observational data including the light curves of SN Ia, the\npower spectra from WMAP7 and SDSS DR7, the Hub-\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 11: Left panel: the relative difference of matter density power spectra \u2206P/P in the models with best fitting parameters\np1 and p2 for classical and tachyonic scalar fields.

Processing of the MCMC chains for eight-parametric models (p = (\u03a9de , w0 , we , \u03c9b , \u03c9cdm , H0 , ns , As , \u03c4rei )) gives\nmarginalized posterior and likelihood distributions as\nwell as the best fitting values of parameters and their\nconfidential ranges. For the most parameters the posterior and likelihood distributions are unimodal and similar, the confidential ranges are narrow. The exception\nis we , for which the marginalized posterior distribution\nis unimodal, but marginalized mean likelihood distribution is bimodal. The values of maximal likelihood for\nboth peaks are very close. The first peak corresponds\nto the scalar field model of dark energy with increasing\nEoS parameter, the second to model with decreasing one.\n\nThe question is: which accuracy of observational data is\nnecessary to distinguish these two models of dark energy?\nWe have shown, that the difference of luminosity distance\nmoduli \u2206(m \u2212 M ) in the models with decreasing and increasing EoS parameter does not exceed 0.1% (Fig. 7),\nwhile the most accurate observational data on SN luminosity distances (SN SDSS, MLCS2k2 and SALT2 [31])\ndisperse around the best fitting model line in the range of\n\u223c 2%. Therefore, the radical improvement of statistical\nand systematic uncertainties of data is necessary for distinguishing between these models of dark energy. Then\nthe statefinder parameters r and s [34] allow the possibility to differentiate effectively the scalar field models of\ndark energy with increasing and decreasing EoS parameters.\nTo diminish or remove the degeneracy between dark\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 13: Left: the relative differences of CMB temperature fluctuations \u2206ClT T /ClT T and polarization \u2206ClEE /ClEE power\nspectra (from top to bottom) in the models with classical and tachyonic scalar fields for two sets of the best fitting parameters\np1 and p2 . Right: the relative differences of CMB temperature fluctuations \u2206ClT T /ClT T and polarization \u2206ClEE /ClEE power\nspectra (from top to bottom) in the models with two sets of the best fitting parameters p1 and p2 for either classical or\ntachyonic scalar field. Dots show the observational uncertainties, modelled for the Planck satellite.\n\nenergy, dark matter and curvature parameters other data\nmust be also improved. The difference of the matter power spectra is maximal (\u223c6-8%) at scales 0.1-0.5\nh\u22121 Gpc (left panel of Fig. 11). The maximal accuracy of matter density perturbations power spectra obtained in the current sky surveys reaches \u223c6% at scales\n\u223c 50 h\u22121Mpc (SDSS DR7), which is somewhat above the\ndifference between model power spectra at this scales. If\nexpected data from the next releases are 1.5-2 times more\naccurate, then they allow us to distinguish surely the\nmodels with decreasing and increasing EoS parameters.\nThe important data in the used set are the data on CMB\nanisotropy, as the difference of angular power spectra of\nCMB temperature fluctuations is \u223c1-4%, which is somewhat smaller than accuracy of the current measurements\nby WMAP at scales \u223c 0o .5\u22122o (l \u223c 100\u2212500) (left panel\nof Fig. 12). We believe that the expected data release\nfrom WMAP team (nine-year observations) and particularly expected Planck data together with other improved\ndata will make it possible to determine whether the EoS\nparameter of dark energy is increasing, decreasing or constant.\nPossibility of distinguishing the scalar field models of\ndark energy with different Lagrangians is less optimistic.\nWe have analyzed only two from many proposed in the\nliterature ones and found that differences between predictions of such models are essentially lower than accu-\n\nracy of current observational data. So, the scalar fields\nwith KG and DBI Lagrangians are indistinguishable at\nthe current level of accuracy of observational data (right\npanels of Fig. 10-12). Only in the case of decreasing EoS parameter the scalar fields with KG and DBI\nLagrangians are potentially distinguishable, perhaps already by Planck data. But in the case of increasing EoS\nparameter they are practically indistinguishable, since\ndifferences for them are \u226a 0.1%, which is essentially\nlower than the accuracy of theoretical and computer calculations of predictions. These small differences have the\nsimple explanation: in such case the densities of scalar\nfields were too low in the past and did not leave the\nfingerprints in the CMB anisotropy and LSS. This conclusion can be generalized for any type of scalar fields quintessence, phantom, quintom, etc.\nWe have considered the principal possibility of distinguishing the scalar fields with decreasing and increasing EoS parameters and two Lagrangians in cosmological\nmodels with the minimal set of parameters. Adding extra\nparameters \u2013 masses of active neutrinos, sterile neutrino,\ntensor mode, primordial magnetic fields, etc. \u2013 weakens\nconstraints on dark energy parameters and possibility to\ndistinguish the different scalar fields modelling it. So,\nonly join progress of theory, laboratory experiments, astrophysical and cosmological observations will lead to the\nunveiling of nature of dark energy.\n\n\f12\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the project of Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (state registration number 0110U001385), research program \"Cos-\n\n[1] E.
