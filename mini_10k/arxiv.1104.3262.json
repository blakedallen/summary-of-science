Introduction\nThe azimuthal anisotropy of hadron production in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions,\nknown under the term elliptic flow, has proved to be an important observable [1, 2, 3]. In\nparticular, its observed size lead to conclusions that concern the time of thermalisation\n[4, 5] and the influence of shear and bulk viscosity [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. To get to\nthese important and interesting characteristics of the bulk matter one must, however,\nreasonably quantify the influence of other effects [12, 13, 14]. Among them there is\nour ignorance about the actual initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution of the\nfireball as well as the role of fluctuations in the initial conditions [15, 16, 17]. Also, the\ntransition from dense hydrodynamic matter to more dilute hadronic gas, which could\nslip out of equilibrium and later freezes-out, may also impact the momentum anisotropy\n[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In this paper we describe a contribution to the elliptic flow which\nmay be important at the LHC energy and possibly also at RHIC.\nThe standard interpretation of the elliptic flow is that it is caused by the anisotropy\nof the pressure gradients within the excited matter. They are larger in the direction of\nthe impact parameter, which is usually called 'in-plane' direction. (The other transverse\ndirection is denoted 'out-of-plane'.) The anisotropic pressure gradients lead to different\naccelerations of the collective flow in the different directions. The fireball then finally\nexpands faster in the in-plane direction. Therefore, more hadrons are emitted in this\ndirection and their transverse momentum spectra are flatter than in the out-of-plane\ndirection. The measured size of this anisotropy, its dependence on the transverse\n\n\f2\nmomentum and on particle species depend on many effects. The one among them\nwe want to focus at is the dependence on viscosity, since one would like to extract this\ntransport coefficient from the data [14].\nThus, if there is an additional cause for the azimuthal anisotropy of hadron\nproduction, this might influence the statements concerning fast thermalisation and\nmaybe even modify the conclusion about low viscosity. In this paper, we consider\nsuch a mechanism.\nAt the LHC, jets and minijets are produced copiously. Their energy loss when\ncrossing the deconfined matter is so huge that only a few of them appear as distinguished\njets [23, 24, 25, 26]. They rather transfer their energy and momentum into the bulk\nmatter and initiate collective phenomena there [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].\nMomentum must be conserved and thus the momentum of the hard parton must be\ntransformed into momentum of a stream of matter (a wake), a Mach cone wave, or\nsomething like this. Much interest is currently devoted to such effects.\nA question arises, what would be the result of many such streams if they all are\ninitiated in the fireball? Some of these streams could merge and either cancel or flow in\na new direction so that energy and momentum are conserved. Original hard partons are\nproduced with no preferred transverse direction. The first expectation would be that\nthe large number of fluid streams they initiate cancel out in some way and in the end\nthere remains just thermalised matter with some energy density and no macroscopic\nflow. However, in non-central collisions the argument might not be so straightforward.\nThe streams have random directions, but their spatial distribution is not isotropic,\nsince it is given by the initial collision geometry. In the in-plane direction the fireball is\nnarrower. Thus there is a good chance that two streams having finite width and flowing\nin the out-of-plane direction will meet (see Figure 1). On the other hand, streams could\nmore easily pass each other without interacting when produced in the in-plane direction.\nThus-very grossly-streams perpendicular to the reaction plane cancel each other while\nthose flowing in directions parallel to the reaction plane survive. As a result, the flow\nof bulk matter receives some feeding from hard partons and this feeding exhibits signs\nof a positive elliptic flow.\nNote that the scenario proposed here is related in its spirit to hydrodynamic\nsimulations with hot spots in the initial conditions which are simulated on the eventby-event basis [15, 16, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Contribution to elliptic flow of the bulk from\nsemi-hard partons has also been considered in [35, 36].\nObviously, this argument is very schematic and to make it more sound one would\nneed to integrate over all possible directions of the streams. The proper way to do so\nwould be the use of a hydrodynamic simulation with included energy and momentum\ndeposition from hard partons. At present, such simulations are not available due to\ntechnical complexity. Therefore, in order to obtain simple estimates of the possible size\nof the effect, we rather construct a simple toy model, which resembles the effect.\nIn our toy model which is introduced in the next Section, we represent the flowing\nstreams by flying blobs of matter with specified size. If two blobs meet, they merge into a\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of the likeness or unlikeness of two streams to meet. Left: two\nstreams flowing in the out-of-plane direction are likely to meet. Right: as the fireball\nis elongated out of the reaction plane, two streams which flow in the in-plane direction\nhave more space to pass each other without merging.\n\nheavier blob which moves so that energy and momentum are conserved. Originally, many\nblobs are generated. Their number and momenta correspond to the expected number\nand momenta of hard partons. In the end, after merging of all blobs which should have\nmerged, they all evaporate pions. In Section 3 we then analyse the distributions of these\npions. It turns out that about 25% of the observed integrated elliptic flow may be due to\nour effect. We also find that this contribution is very strongly fluctuating. Conclusions\nare summarised in Section 4.\n2. The toy model\nStreams within the fluid are represented by blobs. For each blob first its four-velocity is\ngenerated. The momentum is generated according to the calculated distributions of the\nproduced hard partons in transverse momentum and rapidity. For rapidity distributions\nat LHC and RHIC we assume that they are uniform in the central two units of rapidity.\n2.1. Momentum distribution\nTransverse momentum spectra have been calculated and the differential cross section\nfor gluon production in proton-proton collision was parametrised as\nd\u03c3N N\n1 1 d\u03c3N N\nB\nE\n=\n=\n,\n(1)\ndp3\n2\u03c0 pt dpt dy\n(1 + pt /p0 )n\nwhere p0 , B, and n are parameters. The parametrisation works fine in the pt interval\nfrom 2.5 to 12 GeV/c. Calculated spectra deviate from this parametrisation for higher\npt . Note, however, that production of jets at such high pt is rare and thus does not\ncontribute much to the total yield and can be assumed to have small effect on the bulk\n\n\f4\nwhen large number of collisions is analysed. For a simulation at LHC energies we chose\nB = 14.7 mbarn/GeV2 , p0 = 6 GeV, and n = 9.5.\nNow we calculate the total number of blobs in a non-central symmetric collision of\ntwo nuclei with mass numbers A at the impact parameter b (b = |~b|). The cross-section\nfor the production of the leading particle with pt larger that pm is then obtained by\nintegrating eq. (1)\nZ \u221e Z ymax\nd\u03c3N N\ndpt dy .\n(2)\n\u03c3(pm ) =\nymin dpt dy\npm\nThe mean total number of leading particles with pt > pm is then\nNj (pm , b) =\n\nA2 TAA (b) \u03c3(pm )\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 TAA (b)\u03c3(pm ))A\n\n2\n\n.\n\nIn the last equation we introduced the overlap function\nZ\nTA (~r) TA (~r \u2212 ~b) d2~r ,\nTAA (b) =\noverlap\nq\n2\nTA (~r) = 2 \u03c10 RA\n\u2212 r2 .\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere TA (~x) is the nuclear thickness function. The radius of the nucleus is RA and for\nthe sake of our estimates we have assumed very simple profile with constant nuclear\ndensity \u03c10 .\n2.2. Evolution of blobs\nThe blobs represent streams of bulk matter and carry the momentum of the leading\npartons. Once the momentum of the blob is given, for the simulation we need to\ndetermine the velocity of the blob. It will be close to c since all energy of the partons\nis basically due to momentum. Technically, we choose a very small off-shell mass of\nm = 1 GeV. Then, the velocity of a blob with transverse momentum pt and rapidity y\nis\nv \u03bc = (mt cosh y, pt cos \u03c6, pt sin \u03c6, mt sinh y) ,\n(6)\np\nwhere mt = p2t + m2 and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is generated randomly from a uniform\ndistribution.\nJets are produced in pairs which are roughly back to back in the transverse plane\n(but not longitudinally) so that the total transverse momentum vanishes. However, in\nthe parametrisations of the leading parton differential cross section we have assumed\nsome broadening of the transverse momentum due to intrinsic hkt2 i. Since this is an\ninitial state effect, it follows that the total transverse momentum of the hard parton\npair should be of the order hkt2 i. Following this geometry we find that the away-side\nparton is not directed precisely in the oposite way but may deviate from this direction\nby some angle \u03b1 of the order\n\u03b12 '\n\nhkt2 i\n.\np2t\n\n(7)\n\n\f5\nHere, we have assumed that hkt2 i \u001c p2t . Thus the azimuthal angle of the generated away\nside leading parton shall deviate from the opposite direction\np by this \u03b1, which will be\ngenerated from a Gaussian distribution with the width hkt2 i/p2t . In case of small pt\nthis may become a large number. Thus if hkt2 i/p2t > 0.7 we shall fix the width to 0.7.\nThe transverse positions at which the blobs start moving are distributed according\nto the density of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions\n\u03c1b (~r) = TA (~r)TB (~r \u2212 ~b)\n\n(8)\n\nThe time at which the blob is created is delayed by some formation time \u03c40 (set\nusually to 0.6 fm/c) multiplied by \u03b3. The longitudinal position is then \u03c40 v3 . Longitudinal\nrapidity is chosen from a uniform distribution.\nTwo blobs merge when they approach each other in their pair CMS closer than 2Rb ,\nwhere Rb is a model parameter which we will vary in our simulations. In this formulation\nit is the size of a blob but it actually represents the radius of the fluid stream. In the\nmerger a new blob with the same size and a higher energy content is created. It will\nmove with velocity v and the direction of the velocity is chosen such that energy and\nmomentum are conserved.\nWhen there are no more mergers the blobs evaporate into pions. In the rest frame of\nthe blob, pions emitted by that blob are distributed thermally with a kinetic temperature\nT . In our simulation we choose T=160 MeV.\n3. Elliptic flow\nThe elliptic flow coefficient v2 is defined as the second order Fourier coefficient in the\ndecomposition of the azimuthal single-particle distribution [2]\ndN\n= N0 (1 + 2v2 cos[2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )] + . . .) ,\n(9)\nd\u03c6\nwhere \u03c60 is the angle of the event plane. We have written this relation for midrapidity\nso that certain symmetry constraints apply. Since in our simulation we know the\norientation of the reaction plane, we can always use the coordinate frame in which\n\u03c60 = 0 and determine v2 from\nR 2\u03c0\nP (\u03c6) cos(2\u03c6) d\u03c6\nv2 = 0 R 2\u03c0\n.\n(10)\nP\n(\u03c6)\nd\u03c6\n0\nP (\u03c6) =\n\nWe measure v2 in each event as the average of cos(2\u03c6) over all particles and then we\ntake the average over all events.\nIn Figure 2 we show the azimuthal distributions summed over all simulated events.\nFor the most central classes we simulated more than 150,000 events and for centralities\nover 50% the samples count 100,000 events. For the analysis we accepted pions in\nrapidity window from \u20131 to 1.\nIn the histograms we clearly see that the production of final state hadrons is\ncorrelated with the reaction plane.

Histograms of the azimuthal distributions of pions integrated over pt .\nDifferent panels correspond to different radii of the streams Rb and different centrality\nclasses, as indicated in the panels.\n\nwith a non-flow effect stemming from correlation of individual hadrons with each other.\nThe difference between results of simulations with two chosen radii of streams is not\nvery large.\nIn order to better see how the anisotropy depends on centrality and the size of\nthe streams we plot in Figure 3 the elliptic flow parameter v2 as function of centrality.\nAs expected, v2 increases when departing from central events towards more peripheral.\nThis growth turns into decrease for the most peripheral collisions due to lower density\nof streams where the chance of mergers is smaller. The integrated v2 in our simulations\nreaches up to about 0.02. Note that this amounts up to 25% of the integrated v2\nmeasured in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV [41] and a similar share of the elliptic flow\nat RHIC [42, 43]. Thus we want to conclude that the proposed effect of momentum\nfeeding from hard leading partons with subsequent stream interaction may contribute\nconsiderably to the observed elliptic flow.\nWe also found in the simulation that v2 exhibits large fluctuations of the order\nof mean value or even more in some cases. This follows from the nature of the effect\nwhich crucially depends on the mergers of streams and vanishes if no such effect occur\nin a given event.

Conclusions\nOur study qualitatively shows that in nuclear collisions at the LHC relevant effect for\nmomentum anisotropy may be the transfer of momentum from the leading hard partons\nto hydrodynamic medium. Crucial ingredient is the interaction of streams induced in\nthe bulk medium. They may merge and flow together. The net effect is the deflection\nof some of the streams from the out-of-plane direction into the in-plane direction.\nThe toy model simulation amounted to 25% of the elliptic flow that is measured\nin Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. The conclusion is that the effect may be important\nand should be included in simulations aimed at extraction of bulk matter properties by\ncomparing to experimental data. So far, simulations with one jet depositing momentum\ninto bulk matter have been performed [33]. However, to our best knowledge no\nhydrodynamic simulations exist, where the effect of energy and momentum feeding\nfrom many hard partons would be investigated.\nAcknowledgements In its initial phase, this work was supported by the Hungaro-Slovak\ncollaboration grant No. SK-HU-029-06 (SK) and SK 20/2006 (HU).
