Grunwladzka 6, PL60-780 Pozna\u0144, Poland\n\nAbstract\nComment on the Waliszewski's article \"A principle of fractal-stochastic dualism and Gompertzian dynamics of growth and self-organization\" (BioSystems 82 (2005)61-73) is presented. It has been proved\nthat the main idea of this work that Gompertzian dynamics is governed\nby the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation including anharmonic Morse potential\nhas been already introduced by Molski and Konarski in 2003. Some\ninconsistencies and mathematical errors in the Waliszewski's model are\nalso pointed out.\n\nIn a recent article published in BioSystems [1] an idea has been developed that the Gompertzian dynamics of growth [2] is governed by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger-like equation including Morse potential widely applied in spectroscopy of diatomic systems [3, 4]. In particular the equation of growth has\nbeen proposed [1]\n\u2212\nin which\n\n1\n1 d2 f (t)\n+ ae\u2212bt \u2212\n2\n2\nb dt\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u00152\n\nf (t) = ea(1\u2212e\n\n1\nf (t) = f (t),\n4\n\n(1)\n\n)\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212bt\n\nis one of the representations of the Gompertz function. Although the author\npublished Eq.(1) as his finding, an identical equation\n\u2212\n\nd2 G(t) a2\n2b\n+\n1 \u2212 e\u2212at\n2\ndt\n4\na\n\u0012\n\n1\n\n\u00132\n\nG(t) =\n\na2\nG(t)\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\fhas been already introduced by Molski and Konarski in 2003 [5] for Gompertz function specified in the form\nG(t) = G0 e a (1\u2212e\nb\n\n\u2212at\n\n),\n\n(4)\n\nin which a and b are retardation and regression rate constants. To compare\nEqs.(3) and (1) we rewrite the former to the form\n1 d2 G(t) 1\n+\n\u2212 2\na dt2\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nb \u2212at 1\ne\n\u2212\na\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n1\nG(t) = G(t).\n4\n\n(5)\n\nA look into Eq.(1) and Eq.(5) reveals that these equations are identical to\nwithin constants a and b redefined in the Gompertz function (2) by the\nauthor [1].\nThe author [1] (p.65) has posed an important question whether the\nrelationship between the operator differential equation (1), the Gompertz\nfunction (2) and the Morse-like anharmonic potential represents a universal\nrelationship underlying the growth and self-organization of dynamics of a\nsupramolecular cellular system or it is a kind of mathematical illusion. To\nunswer this question a space-dependent Morse [6] function has been taken\ninto consideration [1]\n\u0010\n\nU (x(t)) = D 1 \u2212 e\u2212bx(t)\n\n\u00112\n\n(6)\n\nin which D and b are dissociation and range potential constants whereas\ndistance x(t) is expressed as a continuous function of time. According to\nthe author [1] (Eq.(11)) the potential (6) can be related to the Gompertz\nfunction (2)\n\u221a\n\u2212bt\n(7)\nf (t) = ea(1\u2212e ) = e U (t)\nat the assumptions\nx(t) = t\n\na=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\nD.\n\n(8)\n\nThe assumption a = D leading to Eq.(7) has no physical meaning as\nthe constant a in the Gompertz function (2) is dimensionless whereas D in\nEq.(6) stands for dissociation energy of the system [6]. Hence, proposed\nby the author relation (7) linking Gompertz function (2) and the Morse\npotential (6) is a mathematical illusion.\nAnother inconsistency appears in the derivation of the anharmonic potential for the expanding metabolizing cellular mass [1] (Eq.(20) ) from the\n\n2\n\n\fMaclaurin expansion of the Morse function (6)\n\u2202U\nU (x(t)) = U (x(t) = 0) +\n\u2202x(t)\n\u0012\n\n\u22022U\n\u2202x(t)2\n\n1\nx(t) +\n2\nx(t)=0\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\nx(t)2 + ......\nx(t)=0\n\n(9)\nwhich is reduced to the second order harmonic term\n\u22022U\n\u2202x(t)2\n\n1\nU (x(t)) =\n2\n\n!\n\nx(t)2 .\n\n(10)\n\nx(t)=0\n\nAccording to the author, x(t) has been considered in the form [1]\na\n\nx(t) = e bs (1\u2212e\n\n\u2212bt )+ 1\nbs\n\nln\n\nV0\nas\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nHere as and bs stand for scaling coefficient and spatial fractal dimension,\nrespectively, whereas V0 is the initial volume of cells. After substitution\nEq.(11) into Eq.(10) the latter is named by the author [1] (p.66) ...the potential energy of the anharmonic oscillator for interacting supramolecular\ncellular systems which exist and interact in fractal time-space. This interpretation is internally inconsistent as the second order term of the Maclaurin\nexpansion (9) is interpreted as a harmonic potential and not anharmonic one.\nIn particular the second order derivative in Eq.(10) calculated at the fixed\npoint x(t) = 0\n!\n\u22022U\n= 2Db2 = k\n(12)\n\u2202x(t)2 x(t)=0\nis the force constant of a harmonic oscillator. In view of this it is unclear:\n(i) why the force constant in [1] (Eq.(19)) has been calculated without fixing\nx(t) = 0, although the author uses the proper definition of k given by\nEq.(12);\n(ii) why in the calculation of the potential energy of the anharmonic oscillator for interacting supramolecular cellular systems the harmonic\nterm Eq.(10) instead of the anharmonic Morse potential Eq.(6) has\nbeen used;\n(iii) how the plot of the anharmonic potential [1] (Eq.(20)) in dependence\non the x(t) variable can be generated [1] (Fig.1) if U (x(t)) in the\nauthor's model depends both on time t and x(t) coordinate.\n\n3\n\n\fWe conclude that the proper form of anharmonic potential intended to be\nderived by Waliszewski should be a combination of Eq.(6) and Eq.(11) yielding\n!\nU (t) = D 1 \u2212 e\u2212be\n\na (1\u2212e\u2212bt )+ 1 ln V0\nas\nbs\nbs\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nUnfortunately, even the aforementioned equation is incorrect as the basic\nequation [1] (Eq.(13))\nV = as x(t)bs = V0 e1\u2212e\n\n\u2212bt\n\n(14)\n\nemployed to derive Eq.(11) has no physical meaning. It is as limx(t)\u21920 V0 e1\u2212e\nV0 , whereas limx(t)\u21920 as x(t)bs = 0.\nBesides the aforementioned inconsistencies one may find in [1] numerous\nmathematical errors and other unphysical assumptions specifed below.\n\u221a\n(i) Eq.(11) in [1], is not only unphysical but also contains the error: D\nshould be replaced by D.\n\n\u2212bt\n\n(ii) The Maclaurin series given by Eq.(18) in [1] is incorrect as it does\nnot contain multiplicative factors 1/n!. In consequence this equation\ncontains three mathematical errors.\n(iii) Eq.(B.4) in [1] e1\u2212e = at tbt has no physical meaning as limt\u21920 e1\u2212e =\n1, whereas limt\u21920 at tbt = 0. In consequence the relationships (3) and\n(B.6) derived in [1] are incorrect.\n\u2212bt\n\n\u2212bt\n\n(iv) The plot in Fig.4 [1] does not represents FGauss (t) as on the plot\n\u221a for\nt = 0, FGauss (0) = 1, whereas it should be FGauss (0) = [1/(2.5 2\u03c0)].\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
