However, there are many unanswered questions that remain\nregarding gravity which motivate the exploration of alternate theories: What are the true natures of dark matter\nand dark energy? How should we formulate a quantizable theory of gravity? What drove inflation in the early\nUniverse? Is GR the only theory that is consistent with\ncurrent observations? Moreover, the majority of the tests\nthat have been carried out to date have been in the weakfield, low-energy regime [1, 2]: in the laboratory [3, 4],\nwithin the Solar System [5, 6] or using binary pulsars [7].\nIt is not unreasonable to suppose that GR would begin\nto break down at higher energies.\nOver the coming decade, a new avenue for testing relativity will be opened up, through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) using the existing ground-based GW\ndetectors, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (LIGO) [8, 9], Virgo [10] and GEO [11, 12],\nand the proposed space-based GW detector, the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [13, 14]. These\ndetectors will observe GWs generated during the inspiral and merger of binary systems comprising one or more\nblack holes (BHs). The GWs are generated in the strongfield regime, while the components are highly relativistic and the spacetime is evolving dynamically: GW astronomy will open a new window into the strong-field\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ncplb2@ast.cam.ac.uk\njgair@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\nregime of gravity, complementing traditional electromagnetic observations [15]. A comparison of the GWs observed from such systems with the predictions of GR will\nprovide powerful tests of the theory in a region yet to be\nexplored.\nThe radiation generated during the final merger and\nringdown of two BHs will offer tests of GR in the highest energy and most dynamical sector, but it is thought\nthat the most sensitive tests will come from LISA observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) [16].\nAn EMRI involves the inspiral of a stellar-mass compact\nobject, a white dwarf, neutron star or BH, into a massive\nBH in the centre of a galaxy. The mass of the compact\nobject is typically 1\u201310M\u2299, while the mass of the massive BH (for sources in the LISA band) will be \u223c 105 \u2013\n107 M\u2299 , so the mass-ratio is of the order of \u223c 10\u22127 \u201310\u22124 .\nThis extreme mass-ratio means that the inspiral proceeds\nslowly, and on short timescales the compact object acts\nlike a test particle moving in the background spacetime\nof the central BH. LISA will detect \u223c 105 cycles of gravitational radiation generated while the compact object is\nin the strong field of the spacetime, and this encodes a\ndetailed map of the spacetime structure outside the central BH. This idea was first elucidated by Ryan [17, 18],\nwho showed that, for an arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric spacetime in GR, the multipole moments of the\nspacetime enter at different orders in an expansion of the\nfrequency of small vertical or radial oscillations of circular, equatorial orbits. As these frequencies are in principle observable in the GWs generated during an inspiral,\nit should be possible to measure the multipole moments\nfrom an EMRI observation and hence test whether the\ncentral object is a Kerr BH: according to the no-hair\ntheorem, a Kerr BH is described completely by its mass\n\n\f2\nM and spin angular momentum J [19\u201323], and its mass\nmultipole Ml (M0 \u2261 M ) and mass-current multipole moments Sl (S1 \u2261 J) are determined from these according\nto [24]\n\u0012\n\u0013l\nJ\nMl + iSl = M i\n.\n(1)\nM\nThe multipole expansion is not a convenient way to characterize arbitrary spacetimes, since the Kerr metric itself\nrequires an infinite number of multipoles to fully characterize. Subsequent authors have instead adopted the\napproach of considering bumpy BH spacetimes [25\u201328],\nwhich deviate from the Kerr metric by a small amount\nand depend on some parameter, \u01eb, such that \u01eb = 0 is precisely the Kerr solution. Relatively small perturbations\nto the Kerr solution can be detected in EMRI observations due to small differences in the precession frequencies that accumulate over the 100 000 waveform cycles\nthat will be detected. There are also certain qualitative features that could be smoking-guns for a departure\nfrom the Kerr metric, such as ergodicity in the orbits [28],\npersistent resonances [29] or a shift in the frequency of\nplunge [28, 30].\nThe majority of the work to date has focused on spacetimes that are solutions in GR, but which deviate from\nthe Kerr solution. However, if GR was not the correct\ntheory of gravity, this could also lead to detectable signatures in the observed gravitational waves. Certain alternative theories of gravity, including f (R), do admit the\nKerr metric as a solution, since it has vanishing Ricci tensor, R\u03bc\u03bd = 0 [31, 32]. However, the Kerr metric need not\nbe the expected end state of gravitational collapse [33]. If\na Kerr BH existed in an alternative theory, the geodesics\nwould be the same, but the energy flux carried by the\nGWs could still be different, and so differences would\nshow up in the rate of inspiral; although in many cases\nthese differences do not appear at leading order. In most\ncases, however, either the Kerr metric is not admitted\nas a solution, or it is not the correct metric to describe\ncollapsed objects [32]. Waveform differences then show\nup as a result of the differences in the instantaneouslygeodesic orbits of the compact object involved in the\nEMRI. Since the leading-order energy-momentum tensor\nof the GWs often takes the same form as in GR [34], this\nis the primary effect and means the problem of testing\nalternative theories through EMRI observations is equivalent to the spacetime mapping programme within GR\ndescribed previously.\nAs a consequence of the difficulties of solving for GW\nemission in alternative theories, work on testing alternative theories of gravity using LISA EMRIs has so far\nbeen restricted to a few cases. In Brans-Dicke gravity, in\nwhich the gravitational field is coupled to a scalar field,\ndifferences show up due to a modification to the inspiral rate that arises from dipole radiation of the scalar\nfield [35]. Neutron star EMRIs are required since the\ndipole radiation depends on a sensitivity difference between the two objects, and the sensitivity is the same for\n\nall BHs. Lower mass central BHs provide the most powerful constraints, but a LISA observation of a neutron\nstar EMRI into a 104 M\u2299 BH could place constraints on\nthe Brans-Dicke coupling parameter that are competitive with Solar System constraints [35]. In dynamical\nChern-Simons modified gravity, the action is modified\nby a parity-violating correction, inspired by string theory [36, 37]. In this case, the BH solution differs from\nthe Kerr solution at the fourth multipole, l = 4, but\nthe energy-momentum tensor of gravitational radiation\ntakes the same form as in GR [38]. LISA observations\nof EMRIs should place constraints on the Chern-Simons\ncoupling parameter that are an order of magnitude better than will be possible from binary pulsar observations,\nalthough a full analysis accounting for parameter degeneracies has not yet been carried out [38].\nIn this work, we focus our attention on metric f (R)gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified\nby replacing the Ricci scalar R with an arbitrary function f (R). This is one of the simplest extensions to standard GR [39, 40]. It has attracted significant interest\nbecause the flexibility in defining the function f (R) allows a wide range of cosmological phenomena to be described [41, 42]. For example, Starobinsky [43] suggested\nthat a quadratic addition to the field equations could\ndrive exponential expansion of the early Universe [44]:\ninflation in modern terminology. In this model f (R) =\nR \u2212 R2 /(6\u03a52 ); the size of the quadratic correction can be\ntightly constrained by considering the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated during inflation [45, 46].\nUsing the results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe [47, 48], the inverse length-scale can be constrained\n\u22121\nto \u03a5 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 (50/N )lP\n[40, 49], where N is the number of e-folds during inflation and lP is the Planck length.\nWe consider simple f (R) corrections within the framework of linearized gravity, and explore what constraints\nLISA might be able to place on the form of f (R) (we will\nnot consider cosmological implications where terms beyond linear order could play a significant role). We will\nsee that, although the field equations for f (R)-gravity do\nadmit the Kerr metric as a solution [31, 33], this is not\nnecessarily the metric that describes the exterior of collapsed objects. We consider the modifications to geodesic\norbits in the weak-field of the f (R) spacetime exterior\nto massive objects and, assuming this also describes the\nweak-field external to a BH, we estimate how observable\nthe differences in the precession frequencies will be by\nLISA. We will also describe Solar System and laboratory\nconstraints that can be placed on the same model. The\noverall conclusion is that LISA could place constraints\non f (R)-gravity, which may be more powerful than those\nin the Solar System, but not as powerful as constraints\nfrom laboratory experiments. However, the LISA observations will probe a different energy scale, so these\nconstraints will still be important, particularly if we regard f (R) as an effective theory that could be different\nin different regimes.\nThis paper is organised as follows. We begin with a\n\n\f3\nreview of the f (R) field equations. In Sec. III we derive\nthe linearized equations and in Sec. IV we apply these to\nfind wave solutions. These results can be used to study\nhow gravitational radiation is modified for f (R)-gravity.\nThey are largely known in the literature, but are worked\nout here ab initio; they are included as a compendium\nof useful results within a consistent system of notation.\nTo be able to accurately model gravitational waveforms\none needs to know how an object will inspiral. Accordingly, we derive an effective energy-momentum tensor\nfor gravitational radiation in Sec. V, following the shortwavelength approximation of Isaacson [50, 51]. In Sec. VI\nwe look at the effects of introducing a source term and derive the weak-field metrics for a point source, a slowly rotating point source, and a uniform density sphere, recovering some results known for quadratic theories of gravity.\nThese are used in Sec. VII to compute the frequencies of\nradial and vertical epicyclic oscillations about circularequatorial orbits in the weak-field, slow-rotation metric,\nand hence to construct an estimate of the detectability\nof the f (R) deviations in LISA EMRI observations. For\ncomparison, in Sec. VIII, we describe the constraints on\nf (R)-gravity that can be obtained from Solar System and\nlaboratory tests. We conclude in Sec. IX with a summary\nof our findings.\nThroughout this work we will use the timelike sign\nconvention of Landau and Lifshitz [52]:\n1.

While this action may\nnot encode the true theory of gravity it could contain\nsufficient information to act as an effective field theory,\ncorrectly describing phenomenological behaviour [55]; it\nmay be that as an effective field theory, a particular\nf (R) will have a limited region of applicability and will\nnot be universal. We will assume that f (R) is analytic\nabout R = 0 so that it can be expressed as a power series [31, 54, 56\u201358]\nf (R) = a0 + a1 R +\n\na2 2 a3 3\nR + R + ...\n2!\n3!\n\n(4)\n\nSince the dimensions of f (R) must be the same as of R,\n[an ] = [R](1\u2212n) . To link to GR we will set a1 = 1; any\nrescaling can be absorbed into the definition of G.\nVarious models of cosmological interest may be expressed in such a form, for example, the model of\nStarobinsky [49]\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u0013\u2212n\nR2\n1+ 2\nf (R) = R + \u03bbR0\n\u22121 ,\n(5)\nR0\ncan be expanded as\nf (R) = R \u2212\n\n\u03bbn 2 \u03bbn(n + 1) 4\nR +\nR + ...\nR0\n2R03\n\n(6)\n\nConsequently such a series expansion can constrain\nmodel parameters, although we cannot specify the full\nfunctional form from only a few terms.\nThe field equations are obtained by a variational principle; there are several ways of achieving this. To derive\nthe Einstein field equations from the Einstein-Hilbert action one may use the standard metric variation or the\nPalatini variation [53]. Both approaches can be used for\nf (R), however they yield different results [39, 40]. Following the metric formalism, one varies the action with\nrespect to the metric g \u03bc\u03bd . Following the Palatini formalism one varies the action with respect to both the metric\ng \u03bc\u03bd and the connection \u0393\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd , which are treated as independent quantities: the connection is not the Levi-Civita\nmetric connection.1\nFinally, there is a third version of f (R)-gravity: metricaffine f (R)-gravity [63, 64]. This goes beyond the Palatini formalism by supposing that the matter action is dependent on the variational independent connection. Parallel transport and the covariant derivative are divorced\nfrom the metric. This theory has its attractions: it allows\n\n1\n\nImposing the condition that that the metric and Palatini formalisms produce the same field equations, assuming an action\nthat only depends on the metric and Riemann tensor, results in\nLovelock gravity [59]. Lovelock gravities require the field equations to be divergence free and no more than second order; in\nfour dimensions the only possible Lovelock gravity is GR with a\npotentially nonzero cosmological constant [60\u201362].\n\n\f4\nfor a natural introduction of torsion. However, it is not\na metric theory of gravity and so cannot satisfy all the\npostulates of the Einstein equivalence principle [1]: a free\nparticle does not necessarily follow a geodesic and so the\neffects of gravity might not be locally removed [59]. The\nimplications of this have not been fully explored, but for\nthis reason we will not consider the theory further.\nWe will restrict our attention to metric f (R)-gravity.\nThis is preferred as the Palatini formalism has undesirable properties: static spherically symmetric objects described by a polytropic equation of state are subject to\na curvature singularity [40, 65, 66]. Varying the action\nwith respect to the metric g \u03bc\u03bd produces\nZ \u001a\n\u221a\n1\n\u03b4S =\nf \u2032 (R) \u2212g [R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd + g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003]\n16\u03c0G\n\u001b\n1\u221a\n\u2212 f (R)\n(7)\n\u2212gg\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4g \u03bc\u03bd d4 x,\n2\n\nwhere \u0003 = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd is the d'Alembertian and a prime\ndenotes differentiation with respect to R. Proceeding\nfrom here requires certain assumptions regarding surface terms. In the case of the Einstein-Hilbert action\nthese gather into a total derivative. It is possible to subtract this from the action to obtain a well-defined variational quantity [67, 68]. This is not the case for general\nf (R) [69]. However, since the action includes higherorder derivatives of the metric we are at liberty to fix\nmore degrees of freedom at the boundary, in so doing\neliminating the importance of the surface terms [39, 70].\nSetting the variation \u03b4R = 0 on the boundary allows us\nto subtract a term similar to in GR [71]. Thus we have\na well-defined variational quantity, from which we can\nobtain the field equations.\nThe vacuum field equations are\nf\nf R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f + g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003f \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n2\nTaking the trace of our field equations gives\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nf \u2032 R + 3\u0003f \u2032 \u2212 2f = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nActing upon this with the covariant derivative\n8\u03c0G\u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = \u2207\u03bc G\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n= R\u03bc\u03bd \u2207 f + f \u2207 R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u2212 (\u0003\u2207\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bd \u0003) f \u2032 .\n(14)\n\u03bc \u2032\n\na0 = 0.\n\n(10)\n\n(\u0003\u2207\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bd \u0003) f \u2032 = R\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc f \u2032 ,\n\nf\ng\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n8\u03c0G\u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\nIII.\n\nB.\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd ;\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(13)\n\n(19)\n\nSimilarly, the trace h is given by\n(20)\n\nAll quantities denoted by \"h\" are strictly O(\u03b5).\nThe linearized connection is\n\u0393(1)\n\nIf we introduce matter with a stress-energy tensor T\u03bc\u03bd ,\nthe field equations become\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we have used the Minkowski metric to raise the\nindices on the right, defining\n\nh = \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd .\n(12)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere, more formally, we mean that h\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b5H\u03bc\u03bd for a\nsmall parameter \u03b5.2 We will consider terms only to O(\u03b5).\nThus, the inverse metric is\n\nConservation of energy-momentum\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nLINEARIZED THEORY\n\nWe start our investigation of f (R) by looking at linearized theory. This is a weak-field approximation that\nassumes only small deviations from a flat background,\ngreatly simplifying the field equations. Just as in GR,\nthe linearized framework provides a natural way to study\nGWs. We will see that the linearized field equations will\nreduce down to flat-space wave equations: GWs are as\nmuch a part of f (R)-gravity as of GR.\nConsider a perturbation of the metric from flat\nMinkowski space such that\n\nso that in a vacuum\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(16)\n\nConsequently energy-momentum is a conserved quantity\nin the same way as in GR, as is expected from the symmetries of the action.\n\nh\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7 \u03bc\u03c3 \u03b7 \u03bd\u03c1 h\u03c3\u03c1 .\n(11)\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is a useful geometric identity [72]. Using this\n\nIn analogy to the Einstein tensor, we define\nG\u03bc\u03bd = f \u2032 R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f \u2032 + g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003f \u2032 \u2212\n\n\u03bc\n\nThe second term contains the covariant derivative of the\nEinstein tensor and so is zero. The final term can be\nshown to be\n\n(9)\n\nIf we consider a uniform flat spacetime R = 0, this equation gives [56]\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u03c1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\n1 \u03c1\u03bb\n\u03b7 (\u2202\u03bc h\u03bb\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd h\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bb h\u03bc\u03bd ).\n2\n\n(21)\n\nIt is because we wish to perturb about flat spacetime that we\nhave required f (R) to be analytic about R = 0.\n\n\f5\nTo O(\u03b5) the covariant derivative of any perturbed quantity will be the same as the partial derivative. The Riemann tensor is\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd h\u03bb\u03c1 + \u2202 \u03bb \u2202\u03c1 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03c1 h\u03bb\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bb \u2202\u03bd h\u03bc\u03c1 ),\n2\n(22)\nwhere we have raised the index on the differential operator with the background Minkowski metric.

This will not suffice here, but let us look\nfor a similar solution\nh\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n=\n\nR(1) \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03c1 h\u03c1\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03c1 h\u03c1\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd h \u2212 \u0003h\u03bc\u03bd ), (23)\n2\n\nwhere the d'Alembertian operator is \u0003 = \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd . Contracting this with \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd gives the first-order Ricci scalar\nR(1) = \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03c1 h\u03c1\u03bc \u2212 \u0003h.\n\n\u2032\n\nf (R) = 1 + a2 R\n\n(1)\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\nThe only rank-two tensors in our theory are: h\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ,\nR(1) \u03bc\u03bd , and \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd ; h\u03bc\u03bd has been used already, and we wish\nto eliminate R(1) \u03bc\u03bd , so we will try the simpler option\nbased around \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd . We want B\u03bc\u03bd to be O(\u03b5); since we\nhave already used h, we will try the other scalar quantity\nR(1) .

Consider waves in a\nvacuum, such that G\u03bc\u03bd = 0. Using a standard Fourier\ndecomposition\nh\u03bc\u03bd = b\nh\u03bc\u03bd (k\u03c1 ) exp (ik\u03c1 x\u03c1 ) ,\nb \u03c1 ) exp (iq\u03c1 x\u03c1 ) ,\nR(1) = R(q\n\n(45)\n(46)\n\nwhere k\u03bc and q\u03bc are four-wavevectors. From (44) we\nknow that k\u03bc is a null vector, so for a wave travelling\nalong the z-axis\nk \u03bc = \u03c9(1, 0, 0, 1),\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency. Similarly, from (28)\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n(48)\nq \u03bc = \u03a9, 0, 0, \u03a92 \u2212 \u03a52 ,\n\nfor frequency \u03a9.

For \u03a9 < \u03a5, we find an\nevanescently decaying wave. The travelling wave is dispersive. For waves made up of a range of frequency components there will be a time delay between the arrival of\nthe high-frequency and low-frequency constituents. This\nmay make it difficult to reconstruct a waveform, should\nthe scalar mode be observed with a GW detector [79].\nFrom the gauge condition (38) we find that k \u03bc is orthogonal to b\nh\u03bc\u03bd ,\nh\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\nk\u03bcb\n\n(50)\n\n(52)\n\nFor nonzero R(1) (as required for the Ricci mode) there\nis no way to make a gauge choice such that the trace\nh will vanish [76, 78]. This is distinct from in GR. It\nis possible, however, to make a gauge choice such that\nthe trace h will vanish. Consider a gauge transformation\ngenerated by \u03be\u03bc which satisfies \u0003\u03be\u03bc = 0, and so has a\nFourier decomposition\n\u03be\u03bc = \u03beb\u03bc exp (ik\u03c1 x\u03c1 ) .\n\n(53)\n\nh\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 h\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03be\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd \u03be\u03bc \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03c1 \u03be\u03c1 ,\n\n(54)\n\nA transformation\nIV.\n\n(51)\n\nLet us consider the implications of (43) using equations\n(28) and (35),\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0003 4a2 R(1) + h = 0\n\n(43)\n\nInserting this into (40), with b = \u22121, we see\n1\n\u2212 \u0003h\u03bc\u03bd = G (1) \u03bc\u03bd ;\n2\n\nin this case\n\nwould ensure both conditions (38) and (44) are satisfied [53].

In this gauge we have\nh\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 a2 R(1) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\nThus h\u03bc\u03bd behaves just as\ndefine\n\uf8ee\n0\ni\nh\n0\n\uf8ef\nb\nh\u03bc\u03bd = \uf8f0\n0\n\nits GR counterpart; we can\n\n0\n0\nh+ h\u00d7\nh\u00d7 \u2212h+\n0 0\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\uf8fa\n,\n0\uf8fb\n0\n\n(58)\n\nwhere h+ and h\u00d7 are constants representing the amplitudes of the two transverse polarizations of gravitational\nradiation.\nIt is important that our solutions reduce to those of GR\nin the event that f (R) = R. In our linearized approach\nthis corresponds to a2 \u2192 0, \u03a52 \u2192 \u221e. We see from (48)\nthat in this limit it would take an infinite frequency to\nexcite a propagating Ricci mode, and evanescent waves\nwould decay away infinitely quickly. Therefore there\nwould be no detectable Ricci modes and we would only\nobserve the two polarizations found in GR. Additionally,\nh\u03bc\u03bd would simplify to its usual trace-reversed form.\n\n\f7\nV.\n\nENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR\n\nWe expect gravitational radiation to carry energymomentum. Unfortunately, it is difficult to define a\nproper energy-momentum tensor for a gravitational field:\nas a consequence of the equivalence principle it is possible to transform to a freely falling frame, eliminating the\ngravitational field and any associated energy density at\na given point, although we can still define curvature in\nthe neighbourhood of this point [53, 77]. We will do\nnothing revolutionary here, but will follow the approach\nof Isaacson [50, 51]. The full field equations (8) have\nno energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field\non the right-hand side. However, by expanding beyond\nthe linear terms we can find a suitable effective energymomentum tensor for GWs. Expanding G\u03bc\u03bd in orders of\nh\u03bc\u03bd\nG\u03bc\u03bd = G (B) \u03bc\u03bd + G (1) \u03bc\u03bd + G (2) \u03bc\u03bd + . . .\n\n(59)\n\nWe use (B) for the background term instead of (0) to\navoid potential confusion regarding its order in \u03b5. So far\nwe have assumed that our background is flat; however,\nwe can imagine that should the gravitational radiation\ncarry energy-momentum then this would act as a source\nof curvature for the background [80]. This is a secondorder effect that may be encoded, to accuracy of O(\u03b52 ),\nas\nG (B) \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212G (2) \u03bc\u03bd .\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd is the background metric. This changes our\ndefinition for h\u03bc\u03bd : instead of being the total perturbation from flat Minkowski, it is the dynamical part of the\nmetric with which we associate radiative effects. Since\nwe know that G (B) \u03bc\u03bd is O(\u03b52 ), we decompose our background metric as\n\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + j\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03bb\n\nwhere j\u03bc\u03bd is O(\u03b52 ) to ensure that R(B) \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 is also O(\u03b52 ).\nTherefore its introduction will make no difference to the\nlinearized theory.\nWe will consider terms only to O(\u03b52 ). We identify\n(1) \u03c1\n\u0393\n\u03bc\u03bd from (21). There is one small subtlety: whether\nwe use the background metric \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd or \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd to raise indices\nof \u2202\u03bc and h\u03bc\u03bd . Fortunately, to the accuracy considered\nhere, it does not make a difference; however, we will consider the indices to be changed with \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd . We will not\ndistinguish between \u2202\u03bc and \u2207(B) \u03bc , the covariant derivative for the background metric: to the order of accuracy\nrequired covariant derivatives would commute and \u2207(B) \u03bc\nbehaves just like \u2202\u03bc . Thus\n\u0011\nh \u0010\n\u03c1\n1\n\u0393(1) \u03bc\u03bd = \u03b3 \u03c1\u03bb \u2202\u03bc h\u03bb\u03bd \u2212 a2 R(1) \u03b3\u03bb\u03bd\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n+ \u2202\u03bd h\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 a2 R(1) \u03b3\u03bb\u03bc\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bb h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 a2 R(1) \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(65)\n\n(60)\n\nand\n\nBy shifting G (2) \u03bc\u03bd to the right-hand side we create an\neffective energy-momentum tensor. As in GR we will average over several wavelengths, assuming that the background curvature is on a larger scale [34, 53],\nD\nE\nG (B) \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 G (2) \u03bc\u03bd .\n(61)\n\n\u0393(2)\n\nBy averaging we probe the curvature in a macroscopic region about a given point in spacetime, yielding a gaugeinvariant measure of the gravitational field strength. The\naveraging can be thought of as smoothing out the rapidly\nvarying ripples of the radiation, leaving only the coarsegrained component that acts as a source for the background curvature.3 The effective energy-momentum tensor for the radiation is\n1 D (2) E\nt\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n(62)\nG \u03bc\u03bd .\n8\u03c0G\nHaving made this provisional identification, we must\nset about carefully evaluating the various terms in (59).\nWe begin as in Sec.

In linearized theory our f (R) reduces to quadratic\ntheory, as to first order f (R) = R + a2 R2 /2.\nExtending this result to a slowly rotating source with\nangular momentum J, we then have the additional\nterm [77]\nh\n\n0i\n\n=\u2212\n\n2G ijk\n\u01eb Jj xk ,\nc2 r 3\n\n(101)\n\n\f10\nwhere \u01ebijk is the Levi-Civita alternating tensor.

This is not the first-order\nlimit of the Kerr metric (aside from as a2 \u2192 0, \u03a5 \u2192 \u221e).\nIn f (R)-gravity Birkhoff's theorem no longer applies [85\u201389]: the metric about a spherically symmetric mass does not correspond to the equivalent of the\nSchwarzschild solution. The distribution of matter influences how the Ricci scalar decays, and consequently\nGauss' theorem is not applicable.

However, we expect a solution\nto have the appropriate limiting form as given above.\nIt has been suggested that since R = 0 is a valid solution to the vacuum equations, the BH solutions of GR\nshould also be the BH solutions in f (R) [31, 33]. However, while the Kerr solutions are solutions of the vacuum field equations, the presence of a source complicates\nthe issue; it may be that the end point of gravitational\ncollapse is not the Kerr solution, and so astrophysical\nBHs in f (R)-gravity may not be the same as their GR\nequivalents. We have seen that having a nonzero stressenergy tensor at the origin, because of (28), forces R to\nbe nonzero in the surrounding vacuum, although it will\ndecay to zero at infinity [90]. While one cannot generalise straightforwardly from our simple \u03b4-function sources\n\nto complete BH solutions, because of the horizon in the\nBH spacetime, these solutions suggest that astrophysical\nBHs could be different from the Kerr solution.6 If astrophysical BHs are not described by the Kerr metric, these\nweak-field metrics provide a reasonable candidate for the\nalternative form.\nIf the astrophysical BHs in f (R)-gravity have a different structure from their GR counterparts it should be\npossible to distinguish between theories by observing the\nBHs that form. It is this possibility that we focus on in\nthe next section. Even in the event that the BH spacetimes do coincide, we could still detect differences in the\nproperties of extended sources.\nB.\n\nIt is useful to transform the weak-field metric, (102),\nto the more familiar form\n4GJ\nsin2 \u03b8d\u03c6dt \u2212 B(e\nr )de\nr 2 \u2212 re 2 d\u03a92 .\nre\n(106)\nThe coordinate re is a circumferential measure, as in the\nSchwarzschild metric, as opposed to r, used in preceding\nsections, which is a radial distance (an isotropic coordinate) [53, 90].

We will\nconsider the epicyclic motion produced by perturbing a\ncircular orbit. There are two epicyclic frequencies associated with any circular-equatorial orbit, characterizing\nperturbations in the radial and vertical directions respectively [95]. We will start by deriving a general result for\nany metric of the form of (106), and then specialise to our\nf (R) solution. We will work in the slow-rotation limit,\nkeeping only linear terms in J.\nAn orbit in a spacetime described by (106) has as constants of motion: the orbiting particle's rest mass, the energy (per unit mass) of the orbit E and the z-component\nof the angular momentum (per unit mass) Lz .

In\nprinciple, the deviations will be observable if the orbit\nlooks sufficiently different from orbits in the Kerr metric.8\nTo quantify the amount of difference, we need to identify orbits between the two spacetimes, and for circularequatorial orbits there is a natural way to do this: by\nidentifying orbits with the same frequency \u03c90 , since this\nis a gauge-invariant observable quantity [96]. The quantity\n\u2206(\u03c90 , \u03a5) = \u03a9(\u03c90 , \u03a5) \u2212 \u03a9(\u03c90 , \u03a5 \u2192 \u221e)\n\n(128)\n\ncharacterizes the rate of increase in the phase difference\nbetween the f (R) trajectory and the Kerr trajectory with\nthe same frequency and spin parameter.9 A physical\neffect is in principle observable if it leads to a significant phase shift in a gravitational waveform over the\nlength of an observation. Thus, a simple criterion for\nthe f (R) theory to be distinguishable from GR would\nbe that Tobs \u2206 > 2\u03c0, for observation period Tobs . This\nis a significant oversimplification, since we have assumed\nthat only the orbital frequency has been matched to a\n\n8\n\n9\n\nB\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nB\n\n\u20322\n\nL2z\n\nB\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nB\n\n\u20322\n\n2B\n\n\u2032\n\n(127)\n\nTo simplify (125) we have used conditions imposed by\nsetting V and \u2202V /\u2202e\nr equal to zero for circular, equatorial\norbits. These results hold for any metric of the general\nform (106), subject to the slow-rotation condition, which\nwe have used to linearize in J at various stages.\nA.\n\n!\n\nthe energy or angular momentum. However, these corrections\nare quadratic in the amplitude of the perturbation, and so we\ncan ignore them at linear order.\nHere we assume that the end point of gravitational collapse is\nnot the Kerr solution, and that the weak-field f (R) metric is a\nreasonable approximation to the true astrophysical BH solution.\nIf it were Kerr, the epicyclic frequencies would not differ between\nf (R) and GR.\nBy comparing the trajectory to the \u03a5 \u2192 \u221e limit of the trajectory\nrather than the exact Kerr result ensures that we are taking the\nsame slow rotation limit in both cases, and will not be dominated\nby O(J 2 ) corrections.\n\nKerr value, while small changes in the other parameters\nsuch as the BH mass and spin, the orbital eccentricity\nand inclination, and so on, could mimic the effects of an\nf (R) deviation. On the other hand, we are also keeping\nthe orbital frequency fixed whereas we will observe inspirals, and this tends to break the parameter degeneracies.\nSince we are interested in extreme-mass-ratio systems,\nfor which the inspiral proceeds slowly, it is likely that\nwe are being over-optimistic, so these results can be considered upper bounds on what could be measurable. A\nfuller analysis accounting for parameter correlations and\ninspiral is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe timescale of the systems we are considering is set\nby the BH mass, and the quantities M \u03c90 and M \u2206 are\nmass-independent. A duration of a typical EMRI observation with LISA will be of the order of a year, and so\nthe criterion for detectability becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nM\nyr\nGM \u2206 = 9.8 \u00d7 10\u22127\n.\n(129)\n106 M\u2299\nTobs\nIn Fig. 1 we show the region of \u03a5-\u03c90 parameter space\nin which f (R) gravity could be distinguished from GR,\nas defined by this criterion. Each curve represents a\nparticular choice for GM \u2206, and the region below the\ncurve is detectable in an observation characterized by\nthat choice for M \u2206. Equation (129) indicates that the\ncurve GM \u2206 = 10\u22126 is what would be achieved in a\none-year observation for a 106 M\u2299 mass BH. The curves\nGM \u2206 = 10\u22125 /10\u22127 are the corresponding results for a\n107 /105 M\u2299 mass BH, while the curve GM \u2206 = 3 \u00d7 10\u22127\nrepresents what would be achieved in a three-year observation and so on. We show results for two different\nchoices of spin, a = J/(GM 2 ) = 0 and a = 0.5, and\nit is clear that there is not too much difference between\nthe two; although the vertical epicyclic frequency is only\nmeasurable for a 6= 0 since it coincides with the orbital\nfrequency for a = 0 because of the spherical symmetry\nof the potential. The results for the radial epicyclic frequency do not differ hugely between a = 0 and a = 0.5\nin this weak-field metric approximation. We note also\nthat we show results only for prograde orbits. For a 6= 0,\nwe can also compute results for retrograde orbits, and\nthese differ from the prograde results but only by a small\namount which is almost indistinguishable on the scale of\nthese plots.\n\n\f13\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\u22128\n\n\u22128\n\nGM\u2206 = 3\u00d710\n\u22127\nGM\u2206 = 1\u00d710\u22127\nGM\u2206 = 3\u00d710\n\u22126\nGM\u2206 = 1\u00d710\n\u22126\nGM\u2206 = 3\u00d710\n\u22125\nGM\u2206 = 1\u00d710\n\n0\n\n0\n\nGM\u03a5\n\n10\n\nGM\u03a5\n\n10\n\nGM\u2206 = 3\u00d710\n\u22127\nGM\u2206 = 1\u00d710\u22127\nGM\u2206 = 3\u00d710\n\u22126\nGM\u2206 = 1\u00d710\n\u22126\nGM\u2206 = 3\u00d710\n\u22125\nGM\u2206 = 1\u00d710\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n10\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nGM\u03c90\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nGM\u03c90\n\nFIG. 1. Region of parameter space in which f (R) theories can be distinguished from GR when the central BH has spin a = 0\n(left panel) or a = 0.5 (right panel). Each curve corresponds to a particular specification of the detectability criterion given in\n(129) in the text, as identified in the key. Dashed lines correspond to measurements of the vertical epicyclic frequency, while\nsolid lines represent measurements of the radial epicyclic frequency. The region below the curve could be distinguishable in a\nLISA observation with that detectability value.\n\nOur conclusion from Fig. 1 is that, broadly speaking,\nwe would be able to distinguish spacetimes with GM \u03a5 .\n1, for a 106 M\u2299 BH this corresponds to \u03a5 . 10\u22129 m\u22121 .\nSomewhat larger values are accessible at higher frequencies, but this conclusion must be treated somewhat cautiously, as the inspiral would pass through that region\nfairly quickly, and those orbits correspond to relatively\nsmall values of the orbital radius at which the approximations that we made deriving the weak-field metric begin\nto break down. For this criterion, the radial epicyclic frequency is always a more powerful probe than the vertical\nepicyclic frequency. This is to be expected, since the latter is generally smaller in magnitude and so fewer cycles\naccumulate over a typical observation.\nVIII.\n\nSOLAR SYSTEM AND LABORATORY\nTESTS\nA.\n\nPost-Newtonian parameter \u03b3\n\nThe parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism\nwas created to quantify deviations from GR [1, 2]. It\nis ideal for Solar System tests. The only parameter we\nneed to consider here is \u03b3, which measures the spacecurvature produced by unit rest mass.

However, the experimental bounds for \u03b3 are derived assuming\nthat it is a constant [2]. Since this is not the case, we\nwill rederive the post-Newtonian, or O(\u03b5), corrections to\nphoton trajectories for a more general metric. We define\n\u0001\n(133)\nds2 = P (r)dt2 \u2212 Q(r) dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 .\n\nwhere for a point mass\nU (r) =\n\n3 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03a5r)\n.\n3 + exp(\u2212\u03a5r)\n\n10\n\n(136)\n\nOur f (R) theory is equivalent to a Brans-Dicke theory with a\npotential and parameter \u03c9BD = 0 [97, 98].

We must use\nother experiments to put constraints upon f (R).\n\nB.\n\nWe can also use the epicyclic frequencies derived in\nSec. VII for the classic test of planetary precession in the\nSolar System. Radial motion perturbs the orbit into an\nellipse. The amplitude of our perturbation \u03b4 gives the\neccentricity e of the ellipse [100]. Unless \u03c90 = \u03a9rad the\nepicyclic motion will be asynchronous with the orbital\nmotion: there will be precession of the periapsis. In one\nrevolution the ellipse will precess about the focus by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c90\n\u031f = 2\u03c0\n\u22121\n(148)\n\u03a9rad\nwhere \u03c90 is the frequency of the circular orbit, given in\n(118).

We\nwill use the deviation in perihelion precession rate from\nthe GR prediction to constrain the value of \u03b6, and hence\n\u03a5 and a2 . All the precession rates are consistent with\nGR predictions (\u2206\u031f = 0) to within their uncertainties.\nAssuming that these uncertainties constrain the possible deviation from GR we can use them as bounds for\nthe f (R) corrections. Table II shows the constraints for\n\u03a5 and a2 obtained by equating the uncertainty in the\nprecession rate \u03c3\u2206\u031f with the f (R) correction, and similarly using twice the uncertainty 2\u03c3\u2206\u031f . The tightest\nconstraint is obtained from the orbit of Mercury. Adopting a value of \u03a5 \u2265 5.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 m\u22121 , the cutoff frequency\nfor the Ricci mode is \u2265 0.16 s\u22121 .

VIII C, it is possible to place stronger constraints\non \u03a5 using laboratory experiments.\nC.\n\nFifth-force tests\n\nFrom the metric (100) we see that a point mass has a\nYukawa gravitational potential [82, 83, 86]\n\u0014\n\u0015\nexp(\u2212\u03a5r)\nGM\n1+\n.\n(153)\nV (r) =\nr\n3\nPotentials of this form are well studied in fifth-force\ntests [1, 3, 4] which consider a potential defined by a\ncoupling constant \u03b1 and a length-scale \u03bb such that\n\u0010 r \u0011i\nGM h\n1 + \u03b1 exp \u2212\n.\n(154)\nV (r) =\nr\n\u03bb\nWe are able to put strict constraints upon our lengthscale \u03bbR , and hence a2 , since our coupling constant \u03b1R =\n1/3 is relatively large. This can be larger for extended\nsources: comparison with (105) shows that for a uniform\nsphere \u03b1R = \u039e(\u03a5L) \u2265 1/3.\n\n\u03a5/10\u221211 m\u22121\n51.3\n24.6\n18.6\n11.9\n2.87\n1.63\n0.56\n0.33\n0.25\n\n|a2 |/1018 m2\n1.3\n5.5\n9.6\n24\n410\n1200\n11000\n31000\n55000\n\nThe best constraints at short distances come from the\nE\u00f6t-Wash experiments, which use torsion balances [103,\n104]. These constrain \u03bbR . 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 m. Hence we determine |a2 | . 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2 . A similar result was obtained\nby N\u00e4f and Jetzer [83]. This would mean that the cutoff frequency for a propagating scalar mode would be\n& 4 \u00d7 1012 s\u22121 . This is much higher than expected for\nastrophysical objects.\nFifth-force tests also permit \u03bbR to be large. This degeneracy can be broken using other tests; from Sec. VII\nwe know that the large range for \u03bbR is excluded by planetary precession rates. This is supported by a result of\nN\u00e4f and Jetzer [83] obtained using the results of Gravity\nProbe B [6].\nWhile the laboratory bound on \u03bbR may be strict\ncompared to astronomical length-scales, it is still much\ngreater than the expected characteristic gravitational\nscale, the Planck length lP . We might expect for a nat2\n2\n); however lP\n=\nural quantum theory that a2 \u223c O(lP\n\u221270\n2\n2.612 \u00d7 10\nm , thus the bound is still about 60 orders of magnitude greater than the natural value. The\nonly other length-scale that we could introduce would be\ndefined by the cosmological constant \u039b. Using the concordance values [47] \u039b = 1.26 \u00d7 10\u221252 m\u22122 ; we see that\n\u039b\u22121 \u226b |a2 |. It is intriguing that if we combine these two\nlength-scales we find lP /\u039b1/2 = 1.44 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2 , which\nis of the order of the current bound. This is likely to be\n\n\f16\na coincidence, since there is nothing fundamental about\nthe current level of precision. It would be interesting to\nsee if the measurements could be improved to rule out a\nYukawa interaction around this length-scale.\n\nIX.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have examined the possibility of testing f (R) type\nmodifications to gravity using future gravitational-wave\nobservations and other measurements. We have seen that\ngravitational radiation is modified in f (R)-gravity as the\nRicci scalar is no longer constrained to be zero and, in\nlinearized theory, there is an additional mode of oscillation, that of the Ricci scalar. This is only excited above a\ncutoff frequency, but once a propagated mode is excited,\nit will carry additional energy-momentum away from the\nsource. The two transverse GW modes are modified from\ntheir GR counterparts to include a contribution from the\nRicci scalar, see (41a), which will allow us to probe the\ncurvature of the strong-field regions from which GWs\noriginate. However, further study is needed in order to\nunderstand how the GWs behave in a region with background curvature, in particular, when R is nonzero.\nFrom linearized theory we have deduced the weakfield metrics for some simple mass distributions and\nfound they are not the BH solutions of GR. Additionally,\nBirkhoff's theorem no longer applies in f (R)-gravity. If\nthe end point of gravitational collapse is not the Kerr solution, LISA observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals\nwill be sensitive to small differences in the precession frequencies of orbits, as small differences lead to secular dephasings that accumulate over the 100 000 waveform cycles LISA will observe. By computing epicyclic frequencies for the weak-field, slow-rotation metric we were able\nto estimate the constraints that might come from such\nobservations. These indicated that deviations would only\nbe detectable when |a2 | & 1017 m2 , assuming an extrememass-ratio binary with a massive BH of mass \u223c 106 M\u2299 .\nWe also discussed constraints that could be placed from\nSolar System observations of planetary precessions and\nfrom laboratory experiments. While the LISA constraints would beat those from Solar System observations\n(which presently give |a2 | . 1.2 \u00d7 1018 m2 ), considerably\nstronger constraints have already been placed from fifthforce tests.13 Using existing results from the E\u00f6t-Wash\nexperiment, we can constrain |a2 | . 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2 . For\nthis range of a2 , we would not expect the propagating\nRicci mode to be excited by astrophysical systems as the\ncutoff frequency is too high. But, even in the absence of\nexcitation of the Ricci mode, gravitational radiation in\n\nf (R)-gravity is still modified through the dependence of\nthe transverse polarizations on the Ricci scalar.\nAlthough the constraints from astrophysical observations will be much weaker than this laboratory bound,\nthey are still of interest since they probe gravity at a\ndifferent scale and in a different environment. It is possible that f (R)-gravity is not universal, that it is different\nin different regions of space or at different energy scales.\nWe could regard the f (R) model as an approximate effective theory, and argue that the range of validity of a\nparticular parameterization is limited to a specific scale.\nFor example, we could imagine that the effective theory\nin the vicinity of a massive BH, where the curvature is\nlarge, is different from the appropriate effective theory in\nthe Solar System, where curvature is small; or f (R) could\nevolve with cosmological epoch so that it varies with redshift. The limit on a2 from gravitational-wave observations will depend upon the BH mass, orbital radius and\nobservation time, but it is clear that if the laboratory\nbound is indeed universal there should be no detectable\ndeviation: observation of a deviation would thus prove\nnot only that GR failed, but that the effective a2 varied\nwith environment.\nOne method of obtaining a variation is via the\nchameleon mechanism, where f (R)-gravity is modified in\nthe presence of matter [105\u2013107]. In metric f (R)-gravity\nthis is a nonlinear effect arising from a large departure\nof the Ricci scalar from its background value [40]. The\nmass of the effective scalar degree of freedom then depends upon the density of its environment [57, 108]. In\na region of high matter density, such as the Earth, the\ndeviations from standard gravity would be exponentially\nsuppressed due to a large effective \u03a5; while on cosmological scales, where the density is low, the scalar would\nhave a small \u03a5, perhaps of the order H0 /c [105, 106]. The\nchameleon mechanism allows f (R)-gravity to pass laboratory, or Solar System, tests while remaining of interest\nfor cosmology. In the context of gravitational radiation,\nthis would mean that the Ricci scalar mode could freely\npropagate on cosmological scales [109]. Unfortunately,\nsince the chameleon mechanism suppresses the effects of\nf (R) in the presence of matter, this mode would have to\nbe excited by something other than the acceleration of\nmatter. Additionally since electromagnetic radiation has\na traceless energy-momentum tensor it cannot excite the\nRicci mode.14 To be able to detect the Ricci mode we\nmust observe it well away from any matter, which would\ncause it to become evanescent: a space-borne detector\nsuch as LISA could be our only hope.\n\n14\n\n13\n\nThe LISA constraint relies upon the assumption that the weakfield metric does describe the exterior of a BH; there is no such\ncaveat on the Solar System constraint since the weak-field metric\nis undoubtedly applicable for the spacetime exterior to the Sun.\n\nThe standard transverse polarizations of gravitational radiation\nhave an energy-momentum tensor that averages to be traceless,\nalthough this may not be the case locally [110]; the contribution to the gravitational averaged energy-momentum tensor from\na propagating Ricci mode does have a nonzero trace, see (86).\nIn any case it is doubtful that gravitational energy-momentum\ncould act as a source for detectable radiation.\n\n\f17\nAs the chameleon mechanism is inherently nonlinear, it\nis difficult to discuss in terms of our linearized framework.\nTreating f (R) as an effective theory, we could incorporate\nthe effects of matter by taking the coefficients {an } to be\nfunctions of the matter stress-energy tensor (or its trace).\nIn this case, the results presented here would hold in\nthe event that the coefficient a2 is slowly varying, such\nthat it may be treated as approximately constant in the\nregion of interest. The linearized wave equations, (28)\nand (44), retain the same form in the case of a variable\na2 , the only alteration would be that a2 R(1) replaces R(1)\nas subject of the Klein-Gordon equation. In particular,\nthe conclusion that \u03b3 = 1 is unaffected by the possibility\nof a variable a2 .\nAn interesting extension to the work presented here\nwould be to consider the case when the constant term\n\nin the function f (R), a0 , is nonzero. We would then be\nable to study perturbations with respect to (anti-)de Sitter space. This is relevant because the current \u039bCDM\nparadigm indicates that we live in a universe with a positive cosmological constant [47, 111]. Such a study would\nnaturally complement an investigation into the effects of\nbackground curvature on propagation.\n\n[1] C. M. Will, Living Reviews in Relativity, 9 (2006).\n[2] C. M.
