The simplest and historically the first of these models, named after Eguchi and\nKawai [3], is simply obtained by a full dimensional reduction of a pure gauge theory to zero\ndimensions. The corresponding action reads\nS=\u2212\nwhere\n\u03bb\n\nabcd\n\n1\n=\n4\n\n1\n1\ntr ([A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]2 ) \u2261 \u2212 2 \u03bbabcd Aa\u03bc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd Ad\u03bd ,\n2\n4g\n4g\n\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\na\u2194b\na c b d\ntr ([t , t ][t , t ]) + (a \u2194 b) + (c \u2194 d) +\n.\nc\u2194d\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the Greek indices label the D dimensions (of the original gauge theory space-time)\nand the Roman indices label the adjoint representation of the gauge group SU(N) with generators ta . Various quantities are obtained by taking \"path integrals\" (which are ordinary\nintegrals for this zero-dimensional case):\nZ\nhf (A)i = dAa\u03bc f (A)e\u2212S[A].\n(3)\nOf particular interest is the reduced model analog of the Wilson loop:\n\uf8ee L\n\uf8f9\nZ0\nZ\n1\nW [\u03be(s)] =\ndAa\u03bc tr P exp \uf8f0i ds \u03be\u0307 \u03bc(s)Aa\u03bc ta \uf8fb e\u2212S[A]\nN\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\ndAa\u03bc e\u2212S[A]\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\n(i)\n\nn\n\n0\nZL0\n0\n\nds1\n\nZL0\n\ns1\n\nds2 * * *\n\nZL0\n\nsn\u22121\n\nn\n1 Y  \u0307\u03bck\n\u03be (sk )Aa\u03bckk tak .\ndsn tr\nN k=1\n\n(4)\n\nEven though the Eguchi-Kawai model was originally hoped to reproduce large N properties of the gauge theory from which it is obtained by dimensional reduction, it later turned\nout that this equivalence is undermined by a spontaneous breakdown of the RD symmetry\nthat shifts the values of the matrices A by matrices proportional to unity. Variations of\nthe Eguchi-Kawai model (the so-called twisted [4] and quenched [5] models) have been proposed to reproduce the large N limit of the gauge theory (in particular, the reduced model\nWilson loop of the type (4) would actually equal the gauge theory Wilson loop in the large\nN limit). However, they have been subsequently shown to suffer from non-perturbative\nproblems [6]. A new generation of reduced models has been subsequently developed [2, 7],\nand it is believed to reproduce correctly the properties infinite volume gauge theories. All\nthese more sophisticated reduced models are closely related to the original Eguchi-Kawai\nmodel, even if computationally less tractable.\nIn this paper, all derivations will be performed in the context of the Eguchi-Kawai model.\nThe ideas are nevertheless quite general and should apply to more realistic reduced models\n1\n\n\fas well. This, however, would require a systematic development of the large D techniques\n(see below) for a broader class of reduced models. Likewise, introducing supersymmetry\nmay protect the above-mentioned RD symmetry from spontaneous breaking, and would\nmake the straightforward reduced model obtained by dimensional reduction of the gauge\ntheory describe the large N limit (see [8], for recent considerations in the context of string\ntheory, see [9]).\nA further significant simplification occurs in reduced models when the number of matrices D (corresponding to the number of space-time dimensions of the original gauge theory)\nbecomes large. For the Eguchi-Kawai model, this simplification can be demonstrated by\nthe following technique [10]. (The large D techniques have been recently applied to matrix\nquantum mechanics [11] as well, though matrix integrals will remain our main focus in the\npresent paper.) One first introduces an auxiliary field hab , which is a real symmetric tensor,\nwith the following action.\n1 abcd\n\u03bb (hab hcd \u2212 Aa\u03bc Ab\u03bc hcd \u2212 hab Ac\u03bd Ad\u03bd )\n4g 2\n1 abcd\n1\n=\n\u03bb hab hcd + Kab Aa\u03bc Ab\u03bc ,\n2\n4g\n2g\n\nS[A, h] =\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere K is a dimensionless kernel\n1\nKab = \u2212 \u03bbabcd hcd\ng\n\n(7)\n\nfor the Gaussian quadratic form of Aa\u03bc . Integrating out the auxiliary field, one reproduces\nthe original action (1).\nSince (6) is quadratic in Aa\u03bc , it can be integrated out first. The propagator for Aa\u03bc is\ngiven by\nhAa\u03bc Ab\u03bd i = g\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd (K \u22121 )ab .\n(8)\n\u221a\nBy rescaling the h as h\u0303ab = hab /g D, which is now dimensionless, we can rewrite the\neffective action as\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 abcd\nD\nTr ln K + \u03bb h\u0303ab h\u0303cd .\n(9)\nSeff =\n2\n2\nTherefore, in the large D limit, the integration over h\u0303 is dominated by the saddle point and\none can perform a systematic 1/D expansion. The saddle point equation can be given as\n(K \u22121 )cd\n\n\u03b4Kdc\n+ \u03bbabcd h\u0303cd = 0.\n\u03b4 h\u0303ab\n\n(10)\n\n(0)\n\nWe denote the relevant saddle point h\u0303ab , and if one assumes that it preserves the SU(N)\n\u221a\n(0)\nsymmetry, h\u0303ab = v\u03b4ab . From the saddle point equation (10), we obtain v = 1/ 2N, i.e.,\nh\u0303ab = \u221a\n2\n\n1\n\u03b4ab .\n2N\n\n(11)\n\n\fThe saddle point values of K and its inverse (which is all one needs for computations to\nleading order in 1/D) are\nKab =\n\n\u221a\n\n2ND\u03b4ab ,\n\n(K \u22121 )ab = \u221a\n\n1\n\u03b4ab .\n2ND\n\n(12)\n\nThen, from (8), to compute the value of a certain observable to leading order in 1/D, one\nsimply needs to contract all the A's with\nhAa\u03bc Ab\u03bd i = \u221a\n\ng\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4ab .\n2ND\n\n(13)\n\nand sum over all such contractions.\nIt is interesting to see what these techniques have to say about the expectation value\nof the Wilson loop (4), a crucial observable for gauge theories. It may come as a disappointment that there is no non-trivial large D limit for any fixed Wilson loop (i.e., Wilson\nloop for a given contour). A simple fixed Wilson loop singles out directions in the space\nof the Aa\u03bc 's. On the contrary, in a theory with a large number of degrees of freedom (such\nas a large D limit of reduced models), simplifications occur for observables averaged over\na significant fraction of these degrees of freedom, not for observables to which just a few\ndegrees of freedom contribute.\nMathematically, one can try to take a na\u0131\u0308ve large D limit of the Wilson loop (4). For\nsimplicity, one can take the contour to be rectangular in the (1, 2)-plane. Then, only powers\nof A1 and A2 appear in the expansion of the path-ordered exponential\nin (4). According to\n\u221a\n(13) contractions of A1 and A2 will always produce factors of g/ 2ND. On the other hand,\norganizing the large N and D limit as a power expansion in 1/N and 1/D requires keeping\nthe modified 't Hooft coupling g 2 ND fixed [10]. Hence, any combination of powers of A1\nand A2 will be suppressed by powers of 1/D in the large D limit, and the D \u2192 \u221e limit of\nthe simple rectangular Wilson loop will equal 1, containing no information on the dynamics\nof the theory. It is only when one considers combinations of the sort A\u03bc A\u03bc that contracting\nthe \u03bc and \u03bd indices in (13) lends an additional factor of D, and hence a non-trivial D \u2192 \u221e\nlimit. This is in agreement with the heuristic observations of the previous paragraph.\nThere is a natural modification of the traditional Wilson loop observable that does not\nsuffer from the lack of a meaningful and tractable large D limit. Namely, one can perform\naveraging of the Wilson loop over a large number of different contours. If the chosen\nensemble of contours is rich enough, many directions (many different Aa\u03bc 's) will contribute,\nand the large D limit will become dynamically non-trivial. In this paper, we shall consider\nthe simplest ensemble of uncorrelated random walks (Brownian motion). However, the idea\nis quite general and should apply to more complex ensembles of loops as well.\nThe Brownian randomized Wilson loops are certainly quite different from the regular\nWilson loops familiar to the reader. For one thing, the typical fractal dimension [12] of\na random walk trajectory is 2 (and it is nowhere differentiable). Still, one can give two\nreasons why considering sums over such ensembles of contours is a reasonable idea. First, (in\na Euclidean theory) real trajectories of quantum particles (quarks) have fractal dimension\n2 (and not 1 like the idealized infinitely heavy quark implicit in the usual Wilson loop).\n3\n\n\fSecond, the difference between regular and random Wilson loops appears to diminish in\na sense for a large number of dimensions (which is the case that concerns us here). To\nclarify this, one can consider a random walk with L steps on a D-dimensional hypercubic\nlattice. This walk would occupy a volume with LD/2 points, whereas the walk itself contains\nL points, so (since there are no long range correlations) one can estimate the fraction of\nself-intersections (relatively to the total number of points) as L/LD/2 . So, of course, in two\ndimensions self-intersections typically occupy a finite fraction of the entire trajectory and\nthere is nothing like a notion of the perimeter and interior of the loop. Yet, in a very large\nnumber of dimensions, intersections become progressively more rare, and one should expect\nthe random Wilson loops to look more and more tame.\nIn what follows, we shall consider two cases of Wilson loop randomization. First, we\nshall generate the Wilson loop contour by a completely unconstrained random walk. In this\ncase, the contour does not necessarily start and end at the same point, so a gauge theory\ninterpretation of such a 'loop' is questionable (as it is not gauge invariant). However, the\ncomputation is particularly simple for this case, hence it is a nice toy model to develop the\nrelevant techniques. Thereafter, we shall consider a sum over closed Wilson loops generated\nby a random walk constrained to return to its origin.\n\n2\n\nOpen Wilson loops (a toy example)\n\nWe shall now proceed implementing the Wilson loop randomization program outlined in\nthe introduction. To this end, we define the Brownian average of the Wilson loop as\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee 2\nL\nZ\nZ\nZ /\u03b5\n1\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nWBr (L) = d\u03be(s)\u03b4[\u03be\u0307 2 \u2212 1] dAa\u03bc tr P exp \uf8f0i\nds \u03be\u0307 \u03bc(s)Aa\u03bc ta \uf8fb e\u2212S[A]\nN\n0\n\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd\u03be(s)\u03b4[\u03be\u0307 \u2212 1]\n\nZ\n\ndAa\u03bc e\u2212S[A]\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\nn\n\ni\n\n2\nL\nZ /\u03b5\n\nds1\n\n0\n\n2\nL\nZ /\u03b5\n\ns1\n\nds2 * * *\n\n2\nL\nZ /\u03b5\n\nsn\u22121\n\nn\n1 Y  \u0307\u03bck\ndsn tr\n\u03be (sk )Aa\u03bckk tak .\nN k=1\n\n(14)\nThe measure of the integration over paths \u03be(s) can be straightforwardly understood: we\nare integrating over all functions \u03be(s) subject to the constraint \u03b4[\u03be \u03072 \u2212 1] enforcing s to be\nthe proper length parameter of the path. Note that we have replaced the total length of\nthe path L0 by a formally divergent expression L2 /\u03b5, where \u03b5 is a cut-off associated with\nintegrating over \u03be(s). This is essential to maintain a meaningful continuum limit (as we\nshall see below explicitly). Indeed, random paths of a finite total length collapse to a point\nin the continuum limit. It is only paths of length L2 /\u03b5 that occupy a finite region of space\n(whose size is of order L) as \u03b5 is taken to 0. This is immediately related to the fractal\ndimension of a random walk being equal to 2.\nThe path integral over \u03be in (14) may appear complicated due to the non-linear constraint\nimposed by \u03b4[\u03be \u03072 \u2212 1]. This complexity is, however, spurious. The key idea for taking such\npath integrals over random walks is that the measure is completely factorized (\u03b4[\u03be \u03072 \u2212 1]\n4\n\n\fis a product of \u03b4-functions at each point) and has the form of a factorized probability\ndistribution in the celebrated central limit theorem of probability theory (with the limit of\na large number of independent random variables being simply the continuum limit of the\npath integral). Then the result of the path integration (at least for observables depending\non integrals of \u03be \u0307 over finite intervals, rather than values of \u03be \u0307 at a point) does not depend in\n \u0307 but only on the variance of\nthe continuum limit on the precise form of the distribution of \u03be,\nthis distribution. Hence, \u03b4[\u03be \u03072 \u2212 1] can be replaced by a product of Gaussian distributions,\nwhich is straightforwardly treated in a path integral.\nThere are many ways to implement the measure\ntransformation we have just described.\nR\nFor example, [13] transforms the measure d\u03be(s)\u03b4[\u03be\u0307 2 \u2212 1] using a Lagrange multiplier\nbefore invoking the central limit theorem. Here, we shall take a more straightforward\nroute, manipulating the continuum limit of the measure in (14) directly. (An alternative\njustification for all these formal manipulations with the path integral can be obtained, for\nexample, by considering the continuum limit of random walks on a hypercubic lattice, which\nis an exactly solvable problem.)\nLet us first consider (for simplicity) the expectation value of a general observable de \u0307 but not on the values of \u03be \u0307 at a point (note that (14) is not\npending on \u03be (integral of \u03be),\nquite of that form, but similar ideas apply, as we shall discuss below):\nZ\nhF i = d\u03be(s)\u03b4[\u03be\u0307 2 \u2212 1]F (\u03be(s1 ), * * * , \u03be(sk )).\n(15)\n(We shall assume s1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 sk .) Generically, one can expand F in a power series with\nterms of the form\n(\u03be(sk ))ak * * * (\u03be(s1 ))a1 .\n(16)\nUsing \u03be(si ) = (\u03be(si ) \u2212 \u03be(si\u22121 )) + (\u03be(si\u22121 ) \u2212 \u03be(si\u22122 )) + * * * + (\u03be(s1) \u2212 \u03be(0)) (we assume that\nthe random walk starts at \u03be(0) = 0), it can also be re-written as a sum of terms of the form\n\uf8f6bk\n\uf8f6b1\n\uf8ebs\n\uf8eb sk\u22121\nZ0\nZ\nds \u03be \u0307\uf8f8 * * * \uf8ed ds \u03be\u0307 \uf8f8 .\n(\u03be(sk ) \u2212 \u03be(sk\u22121))bk * * * (\u03be(s1) \u2212 \u03be(s0 ))b1 \u2261 \uf8ed\nsk\n\n(17)\n\ns1\n\n \u0307 and the factors in the\nSince the measure in (15) is pointwise factorized with respect to \u03be,\n \u0307\nlast expression depend on \u03be(s) in non-intersecting ranges, the expectation value will likewise\nfactorize (with an appropriate normalization of the path integral). It is therefore enough\nto consider the expectation value of just one factor:\nI(s, s\u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\uf8eb s\u2032\n\uf8f6b\nZ\ndv(s)\u03b4[v 2 (s) \u2212 1] \uf8ed ds v(s)\uf8f8 ,\n\n(18)\n\ns\n\nwhere we have renamed \u03be \u0307 to v. All the other observables of the type we are presently\nconsidering will be expressed as sums of products of such expectation values.\n5\n\n\fAs was to be expected, (18) is again of the form characteristic of the central limit\ntheorem: a large (infinite in the continuum limit) number of uncorrelated variables with\nidentical distributions, only appearing as an averaged combination in the observable to be\nstudied. To study the continuum limit more explicitly, it is convenient to discretize the path\nintegral in (18), splitting the interval (s, s\u2032 ) into (s\u2032 \u2212 s)/\u03b5 points separated by distance \u03b5.\nOne then obtains\nZ\nY\nX\n\u2032\nI\u03b5 (s, s ) = dvi\n\u03b4(vi2 \u2212 1)(\u03b5\nvi )b .\n(19)\ni\n\nThis integral will, ofP\ncourse, vanish for symmetry reasons unless b is even. Furthermore,\nwhen we expand (\u03b5 vi )b , any terms containing odd powers of vi will vanish after the\nintegration. Hence, the structure of the expanded b-power of the sum will be as follows:\nthere will be ((s\u2032 \u2212 s)/\u03b5)b/2 terms which are products of b/2 values of vi2 at different points.\nFor any terms with a higher power of vi , one will obtain a smaller number of terms ( (s\u2032 \u2212s)/\u03b5\nto a power less than b/2) as more points have to coincide while picking vi 's from the sum.\nHence such terms will come with a greater power of \u03b5 (than the terms containing only vi2 )\nand will not contribute to (19) in the \u03b5 \u2192 0 limit. Therefore, the leading small \u03b5 behavior\nof (19) is\n\u0001b/2\nI\u03b5 (s, s\u2032) = \u03b5(s\u2032 \u2212 s)hv 2 i\n,\n(20)\nR\nwhere hv 2 i \u2261 dvv 2 \u03b4(v 2 \u22121) = 1. (As already mentioned under (14), to obtain a continuum\nlimit one needs to scale positions on the random walk as s \u223c 1/\u03b5, which includes scaling\nthe total length of the trajectory as L0 \u223c 1/\u03b5.)\nNote that (20) is very insensitive to the shape of the distribution of v (as is typical of the\nsituations in the spirit of the central limit theorem): any other distribution (different from\n\u03b4(v 2 \u2212 1)) with the same hv 2 i will give the same result for (20), and hence for expectation\nvalues of any quantities of the type (15). In particular, we can replace \u03b4(v 2 \u22121) by a Gaussian\ndistribution exp(\u2212v 2 ) (again,\nthe normalization of the\nR measure\n\u0001 does not concern us here).\nQ\nIn the continuum limit, exp(\u2212vi2 ) becomes exp \u2212 dsv 2/\u03b5 , which is in agreement with\nthe continuum Gaussian measure obtained in [13]. The conclusion is that, for any quantity\nof the type (15), the random walk measure can be replaced as\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\nd\u03be(s) \u03b4[\u03be\u0307 \u2212 1] \u2192 d\u03be(s) exp \u2212 ds \u03be \u0307 /\u03b5 ,\n(21)\n\nwithout affecting the continuum limit (i.e., a random walk with a fixed speed becomes\nreplaced by a walk with a Gaussian distribution of speeds, which is much more convenient\nto deal with in a path integral).\nEven though the randomized Wilson loop (14) is not, strictly speaking, of the form (15)\nas the different integrations of \u03be \u0307 are entangled with each other, a similar argument (though\nmore cumbersome to typeset) leads to the conclusion that the integration measure in (14)\ncan be replaced as in (21) as well, without affecting the continuum limit. (The key idea\nis again that, after discretization, the only terms contributing to the continuum limit are\nproducts of vi2 at different points, and terms containing higher powers of vi are suppressed\nby powers of \u03b5. Hence, only the expectation value of v 2 contributes to the continuum limit,\n6\n\n\fand the (factorized) measure can be replaced by any other (factorized) measure with the\nsame expectation value of v 2 . We use this freedom to replace the integration measure by\nthe Gaussian one.)\nIn this section, we are considering \u03be(s) to be entirely unconstrained. In this case, the\nend point of the 'loop' does not have to coincide with the starting one. In a gauge theory,\nsuch a Wilson 'loop' would have to vanish by gauge invariance. However, in Eguchi-Kawai\nmodels this vanishing does not occur due to the breakdown of the RD symmetry. Hence,\nthere is no straightforward relation between computations with closed and unconstrained\nWilson loops (the situation may be better in more sophisticated reduced models, where\nopen Wilson loops would have to vanish just as they do in gauge theory, and would thus\ngive a zero contribution to the sum over all loops). Nevertheless, we shall pursue the\ncomputation of the unconstrained average to develop the relevant techniques, as this case\nenjoys a great algebraic simplicity. We shall follow up with a consideration of a sum over\nclosed loops in the next section.\nBefore we proceed evaluating the averaged Wilson loop (14), we shall consider the\nleading large N large D behavior of\nZ\n1\na\u03bc1 ***\u03bc2n = dAa\u03bc e\u2212S[A] Aa\u03bc11 * * * Aa\u03bc2n\ntr [ta1 * * * ta2n ] .\n(22)\n2n\nN\nContracting all the A's according to (13), we obtain\na\u03bc1 ***\u03bc2n =\n\nX \u0012\n\n{i(r)j(r)}\n\ng\n\u221a\n2ND\n\n\u0013n\n\nn\nY\n1\ntr [ta1 * * * ta2n ]\n\u03b4\u03bci(r) \u03bcj(r) \u03b4ai(r) aj(r) .\nN\nr=1\n\n(23)\n\nHere, we have introduced pairings {i(r), j(r)} that for each pair number r give the two\nmembers of the pair i(r) and j(r), and the sum is over all such pairings. It is well-known\nfrom the usual considerations of the large N limit of gauge theories (see, e.g., [1, 13]) that\nthe leading large N contribution into tr [ta1 * * * ta2n ] /N comes from planar contractions and\nit is equal to N n for any such planar contraction. 'Planar' in our context means that if all\nta 's are represented as dots on a horizontal straight line, and all the contractions \u03b4ai(r) aj(r) in\n(23) as arcs in the upper half plane connecting the corresponding points, such a diagram can\nbe drawn without any intersections. The result can be represented pictorially as 'rainbow\ndiagrams' or 'arches' of the type depicted in Fig. 1. As only such diagrams are retained in\nthe large N limit, one obtains\n\u221a !n n\nX\nY\ng N\n\u221a\na\u03bc1 ***\u03bc2n =\n\u03b4\u03bci(r) \u03bcj(r) .\n(24)\n2D\nr=1\nplanar{i(r)j(r)}\n\n7\n\n\f0\n\nL0\nFigure 1: Example of a rainbow diagram.\nWe now proceed evaluating the randomized Wilson loop.

With such\na match, each \u03b4 \u03bck \u03bcl from the contraction (26) will hit the corresponding \u03b4\u03bci(r) \u03bcj(r) in (25)\nproducing a factor of D. For any other contraction pattern, the number of powers of D\nwill always be smaller, rendering such terms irrelevant in the large D limit. Bearing these\nobservations in mind, we obtain\n\nWBr (L) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\n2\nL\nr !n LZ2 /\u03b5\nZ /\u03b5\n\u03bb\n\u2212\u03b5\nds2n\nds1 * * *\n2\n\n0\n\ns2n\u22121\n\nX\n\nn\nY\n\nplanar{i(r)j(r)} r=1\n\n\u03b4(si(r) \u2212 sj(r) ),\n\n(27)\n\nwhere we have introduced the modified 't Hooft coupling \u03bb \u2261 g 2 ND.\nThe rest of the computation becomes very simple now. The integration variables are\narranged as s1 \u2264 s2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 s2n . A \u03b4-function \u03b4(si(r) \u2212 sj(r) ) enforces si(r) = sj(r) and hence,\nall si 's with i between i(r) and j(r) should be equal to each other. Each such equality would\nmake the integral vanish, except that the singularity in the \u03b4-function can compensate for\nequality of two of the si 's (but not more). That means that the integral in (27) will vanish\n8\n\n\funless all the pairings are adjacent (j(r) = i(r) + 1). (This property can be derived more\ncleanly by considering a smeared \u03b4-functions \u03b4(s) = {1/2\u2206 if |s| < \u2206, 0 otherwise} with \u2206\nthat has to be taken to 0. One will then see that any integrals with non-adjacent pairings\nwill be proportional to positive powers of \u2206 and thus vanish in the limit recovering the\n\u03b4-function proper.)\nThere is evidently only one rainbow diagram with only adjacent pairings for each n.\nFurthermore,\n2\n2\nL\nL\n\u0012 2 \u0013n\nZ /\u03b5\nZ /\u03b5\nn\nY\n1\nL\nds2n\n\u03b4(s2r\u22121 \u2212 s2r ) = n\nds1 * * *\n.\n(28)\n2 n! \u03b5\nr=1\n0\n\ns2n\u22121\n\nHence,\n\u221e\nX\n1\nWBr (L) =\nn\n2 n!\nn=0\n\nr !n\nr !\n\u03bb\nL2 \u03bb\n\u2212L\n.\n= exp \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(29)\n\nSo at the end of the day, all the dependences on the random path integration cut-off \u03b5 have\ncancelled out (this simply reflects the fact that we have chosen the correct renormalization\nof the path length L0 = L2 /\u03b5 to maintain a finite spatial extent of the random walk), and\nwe obtain a very attractive expression for the averaged Wilson loop (since L is the typical\nspatial extent of the random walk, L2 is the typical area of its cross-section).\nAs explained above, the derivations of this section are a toy example and do not bear\nan immediate relationship to the gauge theory (because the Wilson loops are not closed,\nand because of the spontaneous symmetry breakdown issues in the Eguchi-Kawai model).\nHowever, one may hope that the attractive mathematical structure we have displayed will\nsurvive in more realistic examples. Furthermore, in the next section, we shall repeat the\npresent computation for the more realistic case of closed Wilson loops and derive (with\nconsiderably more effort) a somewhat more complicated formula resembling (29).\n\n3\n\nClosed Wilson loops\n\nWe shall now constrain the Wilson loop trajectory \u03be(s) to start and end at 0. This results\nin a physically meaningful summation over gauge-invariant closed Wilson loops.\nUp to (25), the derivation is exactly the same as in the previous section.1 Thereafter,\n \u0307\nTechnically, for closed loops, \u03be(s)\nare not completely independent at different points, as there is one\nR L0\n \u0307\nglobal constraint 0 ds \u03be = 0. This constraint, however, does not upset the application of the central limit\nRL\n \u0307\n \u0307 =\ntheorem.\u0010Indeed, one\u0011 can make different \u03be(s)\ncompletely uncorrelated by explicitly inserting \u03b4( 0 0 ds \u03be)\nR\nR L0\n \u0307\ndk exp ik 0 ds \u03be \u0307 . With an unconstrained integration over \u03be(s),\none can consider again the expectation\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR\nR L0\nvalue of the type (15) and include dk exp ik 0 ds \u03be \u0307 as a part of F . The derivations between (15) and\n1\n\n(21) will then apply, the measure will become replaced by the Gaussian one, after which one restores\nRL\n \u0307 and removes it re-introducing the Dirichlet boundary conditions \u03be(0) = \u03be(L0 ) = 0. The result\n\u03b4( 0 0 ds \u03be)\nis the original closed loop integral, but with the \u03b4-function measure replaced by the Gaussian measure, as\nin (21). Again, a variation of this argument will apply to the expectation value of the Wilson loop, which\nis not, strictly speaking, of the form (15).\n\n9\n\n\fto contract the \u03be's, one needs to use the Dirichlet Green function on a line:\nh\u03be \u03bc1 (s1 ) \u03be \u03bc2 (s2 )i = \u03b5\u03b4 \u03bc1 \u03bc2 D(s1 , s2 ),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmax(s1 , s2 )\nD(s1 , s2 ) = min(s1 , s2 ) 1 \u2212\n.\nL0\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\n \u0307\n(Once again, L0 = L2 /\u03b5.) Or, for \u03be:\nh\u03be \u0307\u03bc1 (s1 )\u03be \u0307\u03bc2 (s2 )i = \u03b5\u03b4 \u03bc1 \u03bc2 D(s1 , s2 ),\n\n(32)\n\nD(s1 , s2 ) \u2261 \u2202s1 \u2202s2 D(s1 , s2 ) = \u03b4(s1 \u2212 s2 ) \u2212\n\n1\n.\nL0\n\n(33)\n\nThen,\n\nWBr (L) =\n\n2\nL\nr !n LZ2 /\u03b5\nZ /\u03b5\n\u03bb\n\u2212\u03b5\nds2n\nds1 * * *\n2\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\ns2n\u22121\n\n0\n\nX\n\nn\nY\n\nplanar{i(r)j(r)} r=1\n\nD(si(r) , sj(r) ).\n\n(34)\n\nThis expression only differs from (27) by the second (constant) term on the right-hand\nside of (33). Yet, such a minor difference turns out to complicate the remaining derivation\nconsiderably.

Expanding the\nproduct in the above formula, one will have a collection of terms with different numbers\nof \u03b4-functions. As explained under (27), these integrals will vanish, unless all the pairings\nappearing in the \u03b4-function are adjacent (j(r) = i(r) + 1). If that is so, a general term of\nthis type will have k \u03b4-functions whose argument is a difference of adjacent si 's (denoted\nsp(l) and sp(l)+1 ), and it can be evaluated as\nZ1\n0\n\nds1 * * *\n\nZ1\n\ns2n\u22121\n\nds2n\n\nk\nY\nl=1\n\n\u03b4(sp(l) \u2212 sp(l)+1 ) =\n\n1\n.\n\u2212 k)!\n\n2k (2n\n\n(36)\n\nWe now introduce Rmn , the number of rainbow diagrams (Fig. 1) with m adjacent and\nn non-adjacent pairings, and consider a rainbow diagram with a total of n points, m of\nwhich are adjacently-paired. For all non-adjacently-paired points, the \u03b4-function term in\n(35) cannot contribute. For the adjacently-paired points, one can have contributions from\nk\nboth \u03b4-function and constant term. Furthermore, for k \u03b4-functions, there are Cm\nways to\nchoose their positions on the m arches connecting adjacent points, all resulting in the same\n10\n\n\fvalue of (36). Hence, (35) can be re-written using (36) as\nr !n n\n\u221e\nm\nk\nX\nX\nX\n\u03bb\n(\u22121)n\u2212k Cm\nWBr (L) =\n\u2212L2\nRm,n\u2212m\n2\n2k (2n \u2212 k)!\nn=0\nm=0\nk=0\nr !n+m m\n\u221e\nk\nX\nX\n(\u22121)k Cm\n\u03bb\n.\n=\nRmn L2\nk (2(n + m) \u2212 k)!\n2\n2\nm,n=0\nk=0\n\n(37)\n\nWhat remains now is to evaluate the rainbow numbers Rmn and to resum (37).\nThe rainbow numbers satisfy a recursion relation\nRm+1,n+1 = Rm,n+1 +\n\nm+1\nn\nXX\n\nRkl Rm+1\u2212k,n\u2212l\n\n(38)\n\nk=1 l=0\n\nwith the boundary conditions\nRn0 = 1,\n\nR1n = 1 (any n),\n\nR0n = 0 (n > 0).\n\n(39)\n\nThis recursion relation can be easily understood: consider a rainbow with m + 1 adjacent\nand n + 1 non-adjacent pairings. If the first point is connected to the second one (i.e.,\nadjacently paired), the remaining diagram is a rainbow with m adjacent and n + 1 nonadjacent pairings. This gives the first term. Alternatively, the first point can be connected\nto another point with an even number. Then, the arch coming out of the first point will\nsplit the diagram into two smaller rainbow diagrams (under this arch and outside this arch)\nwith a total number of m + 1 adjacent and n non-adjacent pairings. This gives the second\nterm.\nThe recursion relation (38) is closely reminiscent of the one\nP for Catalan numbers. This\nis not surprising, since the total number of rainbows Rn = m Rm,n\u2212m is precisely given\nby Catalan numbers (see p. 222-223 of [1]). To solve the recursion relation, one introduces\na generating function\n\u221e\nX\nR(x, y) =\nRmn xm y n ,\n(40)\nm,n=0\n\nwhich allows to rewrite (38) and (39) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n1\nR(R \u2212 1)\nR\u2212\n=\nR\u2212\n+\n.\nxy\n1\u2212x\ny\n1\u2212x\nx\n\n(41)\n\nThis quadratic equation is solved by\nx\u2212y\u22121\nR=\u2212\n\u00b1\n2y\n\ns\u0012\n\n11\n\nx\u2212y\u22121\n2y\n\n\u00132\n\n1\n\u2212 .\ny\n\n(42)\n\n\fKeeping (40) in mind, we must choose a solution non-singular at the origin, which is the\none with a minus sign. This non-singular solution can also be re-written as\nR=\n\np\n\n1\u2212x+y+\n\n2\n.\n(1 \u2212 x + y)2 \u2212 4y\n\n(43)\n\n\u221a\nAs a cross-check, the generating function for the Catalan numbers (1 \u2212 1 \u2212 4x)/2 should\nresult from setting x = y, which is indeed the case.

The scale\ndependence of the expectation values of such randomized Wilson loops turns out to be\nstrongly reminiscent of the area law.\nIt would be interesting to generalize the present considerations for randomized Wilson\nloops to more realistic reduced models [2, 7]. This should be possible once the large D limit\nhas been worked out for those theories. The area law seems to emerge quite naturally from\nthe algebraic structures appearing in the randomized Wilson loop computations (a series\nin powers of L2 , i. e., the area, with alternating signs and factorial denominators). It will\nnot be surprising if analogous computations for more realistic cases display an area law as\nwell.\nIt is also interesting to speculate how much the behavior of randomized Wilson loops\nconstrains the behavior of individual Wilson loops. The area law decrease for large Wilson\nloops is very fast, and having individual Wilson loops decreasing slower than the area\nlaw would seem in conflict with the fast decrease of the randomized average. Should it\nbe possible to show that expectation values of individual Wilson loops are positive, the\nfast decrease of the randomized average will become even more constraining (if a sum of\npositive numbers is small, it constrains the magnitude of individual entries in the sum).\nA better understanding of the relations between randomized and individual Wilson loop\naverages could also help to establish the randomized Wilson loop analyzed here as an order\nparameter for the confining phase of the gauge theory (cf. the preceding remarks on the\narea law behavior). These issues certainly deserve further investigation.\nSince the matrix integral (1) appears as a small volume limit of compactified gauge theory (irrespectively of the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence), our present derivations formally apply\n13\n\n\fto the study of that limit as well. The caveat is that the matrix model Wilson loop (4) does\nnot appear to have special significance, unless it can be related to the gauge theory Wilson\nloop via the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence. Some applications of the high temperature/small\nvolume limit of gauge theories can be found in [14].\nIt is instructive to examine our results in the light of numerical findings reported in [15].\nIn that publication, area law for Wilson loop expectation values has been seen via numerical\nsimulations for sufficiently large rectangular Wilson loops in bosonic and supersymmetric\nmatrix models similar to (1). This observation was perceived as an evidence that the\nEguchi-Kawai equivalence holds for sufficiently large spatial scales (since the corresponding\ngauge theories are confining and should indeed exhibit the area law). The validity of\nthe Eguchi-Kawai equivalence for sufficiently large scales has been further heuristically\nlinked to another numerical result described in [15]: the smallness of Polyakov lines of\nsufficiently large circumference. Since vanishing of Polyakov lines would imply a lack of\nspontaneous breaking of the U(N) center symmetry and hence exact validity of the EguchiKawai equivalence, the observed smallness of Polyakov lines was seen as an additional\nindication of approximate validity of the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence for sufficiently large\nspatial scales (physically, above the characteristic size of confined one-particle states). All\nthese observations mesh quite well with the derivations presented here: if the heuristics\nof [15] is taken one step further, one may hypothesize that the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence\napplies to randomized Wilson loops of sufficiently large characteristic size (L). Then the\npresent results will have direct implications for gauge theory irrespectively of spontaneous\nbreaking of the U(N) center symmetry that undermines exactness of the Eguchi-Kawai\nequivalence. Of course, such claims are far from high standards of rigor, as are those of\n[15]. Whatever the case, the derivations presented here can be seen as a first step towards\nanalytic understanding of the numerical observations reported in [15].\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Gautam Mandal, Takeshi Morita, Takuya Okuda and Mithat \u00dcnsal\nfor valuable discussions.
