Besides the\nBose-Einstein condensates (BEC) [1, 2, 3], one can now study degenerate atomic Fermi gases [4] and\nbose-fermi mixtures [5]. These systems offer great promise to exhibit new and interesting phenomena of\nquantum many-particle physics.\nSogo and Yabu [6] studied the ground state properties of fermi gas composed by two spin components\nwith various repulsive interaction and showed the phase transition between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states. Furthermore we extended this study on the spin phases of the ground state to that for\nthe asymmetric gas with a nets spin in the presence of an external magnetic field and gave the phase\ndiagram about these spin phases [7].\nAn important diagnostic signal for many-body systems is the spectrum of collective excitations. Such\noscillations are common to a variety of many-particle systems and are often sensitive to the interaction\nand the structure of the ground state. In ref.[7] we have also studied the spin excitation on the dipole and\nmonopole oscillations in the two-component fermion condensed system. The frequencies of the collective\noscillations with the out-of-phase show the dependence on the fermion-fermion interaction while those\nwith the in-phase are not sensitive to the interaction. Particularly the frequencies of the out-of-phase\nmodes show rapid changes in the phase transition between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic spinphases.\nThe monopole oscillations can be defined only in the spherical symmetric system. In usual experiments\ntraps have elliptically deformed shapes, where the monopole oscillations are coupled with the quadrupole\noscillations. If the trap is largely deformed with the axial symmetry the oscillations must be decoupled\ninto the modes of oscillations along the transverse and longitudinal directions; we shall call them the\n\n\f2\ntransverse breathing (TB) and longitudinal breathing (LB) modes.\nIn this paper we study the coupled oscillation states of the two component fermi gases between the TB\nand LB modes in deformed traps. The oscillation behaviors are expected to show various features as the\ndeformation of the trap is changed.\nThe underlying theoretical tool to treat dynamic problems of dilute quantum gases is the timedependent mean field theory. This is reduced to the random-phase approximation (RPA) for small\namplitudes, and the theory in this form has been applied to density oscillations of these systems [8, 9, 10].\nWhen the single-particle spectrum is regular, the long-wavelength excitations are collective and simpler\nmethods can be used to calculate the frequencies, in particular with sum rules [11] or the scaling approximation. In this work we calculate the frequencies of these collective oscillations by using the scaling\nmethod [12, 13]. This scaling method is physically quite transparent, but it is in fact equivalent to the\ntheory based on energy-weighted sum rules [13], as used for example in ref. [11].\nWe will only consider here the case of positive scattering lengths which correspond to a repulsive\ninteraction. When the interaction is attractive, the system is superfluid in its ground state and the\nexcitation properties are controlled by the energy gap. In addition we will focus only on the collective\noscillations in the paramagnetic spin phases, and do not deeply discuss those in the ferromagnetic regime.\nIn the next section we will explain our formulation, and show calculational results in Sec. 3. In Sec.4\nwe will summarize our work.\n\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nWe begin with the expression for the energy of a dilute trapped condensate in the mean-field approximation:\nET =\n\nZ\n\nd3 r [\n\n3\nm\n~2 X X\n\u03c4s,j + (\u03a92T r12 + \u03a92T r22 + \u03a92L r32 )(\u03c11 + \u03c12 ) + gF \u03c11 \u03c12 ]\n2m s=1,2 j=1\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwith\n\u03c4s,j =\n\u03c1s =\n\nocc\n\u2217\nX\n\u2202\u03c8n,s\n\u2202\u03c8n,s\n\nn\nocc\nX\n\n\u2202rj\n\n\u2202rj\n\n\u2217\n\u03c8n,s\n(r)\u03c8n,s (r),\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nn\n\nwhere \u03c8ns are orbital wave functions indexed by orbit n and component s = 1, 2, \u03a9L,T are the longitudinal\nand transverse frequencies of the trapping field and gF is the coupling strength of a contact interaction.\nHere we assume that all fermions have the same mass, m, but we do not need to treat these components\nas the spin state of the same fermion.\nIn order to study the collective oscillation, we introduce the following scaling for the fermion wavefunction:\n(0) \u03bbT ,s (\u03c4 )\n(e\nrT ; e\u03bbL,s (\u03c4 ) r3 ),\n\u03c8n,s (r, \u03c4 ) = ei\u03be(r ,\u03c4,s) e\u03bbT ,s (\u03c4 )+ 2 \u03bbL,s (\u03c4 ) \u03c8n,s\n1\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n\u03be(r, \u03c4, s) =\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n~ 1\n\u03bb\u0307T,s (\u03c4 )r 2T + \u03bb\u0307L,s (\u03c4 )r32\nm 2\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\n(0)\n\nwhere \u03c8n,s is the wave-function in the ground state, \u03bbT,L (s) are the time-dependent collective coordinates\nfor the oscillation, and \u03bb\u0307T,L (s) are the time-derivatives of \u03bbT,L (s) . The factor exp(i\u03be) is the Gallilei\ntransformation factor which is determined to satisfy the continuum equation.\nLet us obtain the total energy under the above scaling by substituting the wave-function (4) into the\ntotal energy functional (1). The total energy becomes\nZ\nn\no\n~2 X\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nET =\nd3 r (\u2207\u03be)2 \u03c1s + e2\u03bbT ,s (\u03c4s,1 + \u03c4s,2 ) + e2\u03bbL,s \u03c4s,3\n2m s=1,2\nX Z\n\b\n1\nd3 r e\u22122\u03bbT ,s \u03a92T (r12 + r22 ) + e\u22122\u03bbL,s \u03a92L r32 ) \u03c1(0)\n+ m2\ns (r),\n2\ns=1,2\nZ\n(0)\n(0)\n+ge2\u03bbT ,1 +\u03bbL,1 +2\u03bbT ,2 +\u03bbL,2 d3 r \u03c11 (e\u03bbT ,1 rT ; e\u03bbL,1 r3 )\u03c12 (e\u03bbT ,2 rT ; e\u03bbL,2 r3 )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the superscript (0) indicates \u03c4s,j and \u03c1s at the ground state.\nIn this work we use the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation to evaluate the above total energies. The\nTF approximation makes the spherical symmetric in the momentum distribution at each position and\ngives the following relation:\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c4s,1 = \u03c4s,2 = \u03c4s,3 =\n(0)\n\nIn addition the ground state densities \u03c1s\n\n5\n2\n1\n3\n(6\u03c0 2 ) 3 \u03c1(0)\n.\ns\n10m\n\n(7)\n\nbecome functions of \u03a9T (r12 + r22 ) + \u03a9L r32 .\n\nHere we can then make a change of variables to simplify the appearance of the Thomas-Fermi equations\nas follows.\nm 2 g 0 \u03a9j\nxj = (\n)rj\n(j = 1 \u223c 3),\n3\u03c0 2 ~3\n\u0010 mg \u00113 2\n0\n\u03c1(0)\n(s = 1, 2),\nns =\n~2\n9\u03c0 4 s\n4m12 g08 \u03a9L \u03a92T\n\u1ebcT =\nET ,\n(3\u03c0 2 )7 ~21\ngF\ng =\ng0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere g0 is a certain coupling constant which is chosen later.\nWith the scaled variables and the Thomas-Fermi approximation, the expression for the total energy at\nthe ground state is\n(0)\n\n\u1ebcT =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x {\n\nX 3 5\n( ns3 + x2 ns ) + gn1 n2 },\n5\ns=1,2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere x2 = |x|2 . The TF equations for the densities n1,2 are derived by variation of the energy with a\nconstrain on the fermion numbers. This yields\n2\n\nn13 + gn2 = e1 \u2212 x2 = ef + B\u0303 \u2212 x2\n2\n\nn23 + gn1 = e2 \u2212 x2 = ef \u2212 B\u0303 \u2212 x2\n\n(10)\n\nIn this equation e1 and e2 are the Lagrange multiplier to constraint the numbers of the fermion-1, N1\nand -2, N2 , respectively, and they are rewritten with ef and B\u0303; these ef and B\u0303 have the meanings of the\n\n\f4\nFermi energy and the external magnetic field in fermion gas when the two components of fermions are\ndescribed with two different spin states of one fermion.\nIn this expression the ground state is determined by the three variables, g, ef and B\u0303, but the two\nvariables, g and ef , are not independent because of the scale symmetry in eq.(10) [6, 7]. In this work\nwe choose g0 as a critical coupling constant of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase transition at a\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nfixed chemical potential in the symmetric system \u03c11 = \u03c12 . With this choice the fermi energy is fixed\nto be ef = 20/27. The solution of these equations is discussed in detail in ref. [7].

We can obtain these decoupled modes by taking C12 = C14 = C23 = C34 = 0.\nIn the symmetric system, n1 = n2 , furthermore, the two kinds of modes are further decoupled into the\nin-phase (\u03bbL(T ),1 = \u03bbL(T ),2 ) and the out-of-phase (\u03bbL(T ),1 = \u2212\u03bbL(T ),2 ) modes; namely the four excited\noscillations are decoupled into the in-phase transverse breathing (ITB), in-phase longitudinal breathing\n(ILB), out-of-phase transverse breathing (OTB) and out-of-phase longitudinal breathing (OLB) modes.\nThe oscillation frequencies in the symmetric system become\n2(T\u0303 1 + X\u0303 1 ) \u2212 V1 2\n\u03c9T ,\nX\u0303 1\n2(T\u0303 1 + X\u0303 1 ) \u2212 12 V1 2\n=\n\u03c9L ,\nX\u0303 1\n\n2\n\n\u03c9Tin =\nin\n\u03c9L\n\n2\n\n2\n\nout\n\u03c9L\n\n2\n\n2(T\u0303 1 + X\u0303 1 ) \u2212 V1 \u2212 45 V3\n\n\u03c9T2 ,\nX\u0303 1\n2(T\u0303 1 + X\u0303 1 ) \u2212 21 V1 \u2212 53 V3 2\n=\n\u03c9L ,\nX\u0303 1\n\n\u03c9Tout =\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nwhere the superscripts 'in' and 'out' indicate the in-phase and out-of-phase modes, respectively, and the\nsubscripts 'T' and 'L' denote the oscillations in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively.\nNote that T\u0303 1 = T\u0303 2 , X\u0303 1 = X\u0303 2 and so on.\nNext we discuss the oscillations in the near-spherical symmetric system, \u03c9L \u2248 \u03c9T \u2248 1. In this system\nthe oscillation modes are decoupled into the monopole and quadrupole oscillation modes.\nBy taking the collective coordinates to be \u03bbL,i = \u03bbT,1 = \u03bbi , we can obtain the frequencies of the\nmonopole oscillations with the following equation:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8f9 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb\n4(\nT\u0303\n+\nX\u0303\n)\n\u2212\n3V\n\u2212\nV\nV\n2X\u0303 1 0\n\u03c9\n1\n1\n1\n1\n3\n3\n\uf8f8=0\n\uf8f8\uf8fb \uf8ed\n\uf8f0\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 2 \u2212\uf8ed\n\u03a92M\n\u03bb2\nV3\n4(T\u0303 2 + X\u0303 2 ) \u2212 3V2 \u2212 V3\n0 2X\u0303 2\n\n(23)\n\nwith\n1\n1 2\n1\n= ( 2 + 2 ).\n2\n\u03a9M\n3 \u03c9T\n\u03c9L\n\n(24)\n\n\f6\nBy taking the collective coordinates to be \u03bbT,i = \u2212\u03bbL,i /2 = \u03bbi , similarly, we can also calculate the\nfrequencies of the quadrupole oscillations with\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f9 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n1\n2\nV\n2(T\u0303 1 + X\u0303 1 ) \u2212 51 V3\n\u03bb\nX\u0303 1 0\n\u03c9\n3\n1\n5\n\uf8f8=0\n\uf8f8\uf8fb \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f0\uf8ed\n\u2212\uf8ed\n1\n1\n\u03a92Q\n\u03bb\nV\n2(\nT\u0303\n+\nX\u0303\n)\n\u2212\nV\n0 X\u0303 2\n2\n2\n2\n5 3\n5 3\n\n(25)\n\nwith\n1 1\n2\n1\n= ( 2 + 2 ).\n2\n\u03a9Q\n3 \u03c9T\n\u03c9L\n(0)\n\nIn the symmetric system \u03c11\n\n(26)\n\n(0)\n\n= \u03c12 , these modes are also decoupled to the in-phase and the out-of-\n\nphase modes.

As mentioned in the previous section we fix the fermi energy to be ef = 20/27, which makes\nthe parametric and ferromagnetic spin phase transition at g = 1 when B\u0303 = 0.\nDensity profiles illustrating these three regimes are shown in Fig. 1. The panels show the densities as\na function of distance x in a weak magnetic field (g 2 \u00d1B = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) and at three different interaction\nstrengths: g = 0.5(a), 0.95(b) and 1.05(c). The solid and dashed lines represent the scaled density distribution of major and minor components of fermions. From top to bottom, the panels show paramagnetic\n(a,b) and ferromagnetic (c).\nNext we calculate the collective oscillations by solving eigenvalue equation (20). In this equation we\nobtain four eigenvalues corresponding to collective oscillation frequencies. For convenience we define these\nfour frequencies as \u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 and \u03c94 in order of the frequencies from the larger one to the lower one. In\naddition we refer to the four collective modes with the frequencies \u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 and \u03c94 as modes-1, -2, -3\nand -4, respectively.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the frequencies of oscillations as functions of the deformation parameter dT L =\nln(\u03c9L /\u03c9T ) at the coupling constant g = 0.3 (a), = 0.6 (b) and = 0.9 (c). The solid lines represent the\nfirst and third frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c93 , and the chain-dotted lines indicate \u03c92 and \u03c94 . In these calculation\nwe take the magnetic field to be g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 , where the system is almost symmetric between the\ntwo component, N1 \u2248 N2 . In the same figures, furthermore, we also plot the frequencies of the transverse\nand longitudinal breathing modes with the dashed and dotted lines, respectively.\nFirst we see the strong level mixing between modes-2 and -3 at two deformation parameters, dT L = d1\nand d2 (d1 < 0 < d2 ). When dT L < d1 and d2 < dT L , the frequencies in the full calculation (solid lines)\n\n\f7\nare almost the same as those in the calculations decoupled with the transverse and longitudinal modes\n(dashed and dotted lines), though they are quite different when d1 < dT L < d2 .\nIn Fig. 3 we also give the same quantities but with g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 . The system is not symmetric\nn1 6= n2 , but the results are quite similar to those in Fig. 2 though the difference in the frequency at the\nlevel mixing points between the modes-2 and -3 is a little larger than those in Fig. 2.\nFor future discussions we refer to the three deformation parameter regions, dT L < d1 , d1 < dT L < d2\nand d2 < dT L as the prolate deformed, the semi-spherical and the prolate deformed regions, respectively.\nThe transverse and longitudinal breathing oscillation modes are almost decoupled in both the oblate and\nprolate deformed regions, while these modes are coupled in the spherical region.\nIn order to know the level mixing behaviors more, we calculate the four following components:\n1\n\u03bbin\nT = \u221a (\u03bbT,1 + \u03bbT,2 ),\n2\n1\nout\n\u03bbT = \u221a (\u03bbT,1 \u2212 \u03bbT,2 ),\n2\n\n1\n\u03bbin\nL = \u221a (\u03bbL,1 + \u03bbL,2 ),\n2\n1\nout\n\u03bbL = \u221a (\u03bbL,1 \u2212 \u03bbL,2 ),\n2\n\n(29)\n(30)\n\nin\nout\nwhere \u03bbin\nand \u03bbout\nT , \u03bbL , \u03bbT\nL are components of the ITB, ILB, OTB and OLB modes, respectively. In\n\nFig. 4 we show the components of the eigenvectors at the mode-1 (a), the mode-2 (b), the mode-3 (c)\nand the mode-4 (d) with g = 0.9 and g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124. The solid, chain-dotted, dashed and dotted lines\nin\nout\nrepresent \u03bbin\nand \u03bbout\nT , \u03bbL , \u03bbT\nL , respectively.\n\nThe results show that the phase of the modes-1 and -4 are in-phase in all dT L regime. When the\nsystem is oblate deformed (dT L << 0). the mode-1 is almost the ITB mode. As dT L increase, the system\napproaches the spherical, the ILB component in the mode-1 mode gradually becomes larger. When the\nsystem becomes spherical (dT L = 0), the mode-1 becomes a mixed mode with the ITB and ILB in the\nsame ratio: namely the mode-1 is the monopole oscillation. As the system is further deformed to the\nprolate shape, the transverse component decreases and the longitudinal one increases and the oscillation\nbecomes the in-phase longitudinal oscillation in \u03c9L /\u03c9T \u2192 \u221e limit.\nThe mode-4 has the same behavior, but its phase is out-of-phase; the OTB mode when dT L < d1 , the\nout-of-phase monopole mode at dT L = 0 and the OLB mode when dT L > d2 .\nThe variations of the modes-2 and -3 show more complicated behaviors. The mode-2 is mainly the\nOTB mode in the oblate deformed region (dT L < d1 ), and the OLB mode in the prolate deformation\nregion ( dT L > d2 ). The mode-3 is the ILB mode in the oblate deformation, and the ITB mode in\nthe prolate deformation. At dT L = d1 and d2 , the modes-2 and -3 make the level mixing and exchange\ntheir roles. Namely the modes-2 and -3 are in-phase out-of-phase oscillations in the semi-spherical region,\nrespectively. As dT L approaches zero, the TB and LB oscillation modes are mixed. At dT L = 0, the modein\n2 becomes the in-phase quadrupole oscillations, (\u03bbin\nL = \u22122\u03bbT ) and the mode-3 becomes the out-of-phase\n\nones, respectively.\nThus we know that the four modes agree with the frequencies of the TB and LB modes, when \u03c9L /\u03c9T >>\n1 (dT L >> 0), and \u03c9T /\u03c9L >> 1 (dT L << 0). On the other hand these modes show different behaviors\nin the nearly spherical symmetric system (dT L \u2248 0), where the collective oscillations are described as the\ncoupled modes of the monopole and quadrupole oscillations.\nIn Fig. 5, furthermore, we show the same quantities in Fig. 4 but with g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 . The feature\n\n\f8\ndiscussed above is less clear, but also seen in the case of the strong magnetic field.\nWhen g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 , the number asymmetry is not so small, N1 & N2 . The mixing between the\nin-phase and out-of-phase modes is very small in modes-1 and -4. The similar result was shown for the\nmonopole oscillation in the spherical trap. Even in modes-2 and -3, this mixing is seen only in the region\nnear dT L \u2248 d1 and dT L \u2248 d2 . Hence we can disregard the mixing between the in-phase and out-of-phase\nmodes in qualitative discussions, and consider that modes-2 and -3 exchange their roles around dT L \u2248 d1\nand dT L \u2248 d2 .\nIn order to know more details of the deformation dependence, we should examine relations between\nthe frequencies of the collective oscillations and the coupling constant g. First we show the frequencies\nof the monopole and quadrupole oscillations versus the coupling constant g in the spherical symmetric\nsystem (\u03c9L = \u03c9T ) with the g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 in Fig. 6. The solid and dashed lines represent the results of\nthe monopole and quadrupole oscillations. In the completely spherical symmetric system the monopole\nand quadrupole states are decoupled, and there is no level mixing between these two modes. In the\nparamagnetic phase (g . 1.0), larger frequencies correspond to the in-phase oscillation modes both in the\nmonopole and quadrupole modes. The monopole modes make the level mixing between the in-phase and\nout-of-phase modes in the ferromagnetic phase (g . 1.0), while the quadrupole modes do not show the\nlevel mixing. As the coupling becomes larger, the frequency of the oscillation modes except the in-phase\nmonopole oscillation mode decreases monotonically until g \u2248 1.0, and increases above that, while the\nfrequencies of the in-phase monopole oscillation are almost invalid. When the coupling constant increases\nfurther, the level mixing between the two modes of the monopole oscillation occurs.\nNext we study the non-symmetric system, where all the four modes can be mixed. In Fig. 7 we show\nthe frequencies of the mode-1, -2, -3 and -4 as the functions of the coupling constant with \u03c9L /\u03c9T = 1.5\n(dT L = 0.41) (a), \u03c9L /\u03c9T = 0.7 (dT L = \u22120.36) (b), \u03c9L /\u03c9T = 0.5 (dT L = \u22120.69) (c) and \u03c9L /\u03c9T = 0.3\n(dT L = \u22121.2) (d). In these figures we see again that the levels between modes-2 and -3 are mixed at\na certain g. When \u03c9L /\u03c9T = 0.7 (Fig. 7), for example, the frequencies of modes-1 and -2 are \u03c9 = 2\u03c9T ,\nand those of modes-3 and -4 are \u03c9 = 2\u03c9L at g = 0. As the coupling becomes larger, the frequencies of\nmodes-2 and -4 monotonously decreases while those of modes-1 and -3 is almost invalid, and then the\nthe level mixing between modes-2 and -3 occurs at g \u2248 0.37.\nAs the deformation parameter dT L increases, the difference between \u03c9T and \u03c9L becomes larger, and\nthe level mixing occurs at larger coupling constant. As the deformation parameter further increases,\nthe level mixing disappears when dT L < d1 because the minimum value of \u03c92 is larger than \u03c93 , and\nthe level mixing cannot occur. The \u03c92 becomes minimum at the border between the paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic phases g \u2248 1, where the level mixing occurs when dT L = d1 .\nIn Fig. 8 we show the components of the eigenvectors at the mode-1 (a), the mode-2 (b), the mode-3\n(c) and the mode-4 (d) with g 2 B\u0303 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 and \u03c9L /\u03c9T = 0.7. The mode-1 and the mode-4 are almost\nITB and OLB modes in the weak coupling region, respectively. As the coupling, g, increases, the ILB\nand OTB components are gradually mixed in both the modes. In the case of the mode-1, this mixing is\nsmall, while in the mode-4 the OLB and OTB components are more largely mixed, particularly around\ng \u2248 1.\nIn this figure, furthermore, we can also see the level mixing between modes-2 and -3. At g = 0 the\n\n\f9\nmode-2 and the mode-3 are the ILB and OTB modes. As the coupling increases, the ITB and OLB\ncomponents are more mixed in the mode-2 and the mode-3, respectively. At g \u2248 0.37 the level mixing\noccurs. The strength of the components is exchanged between the modes-2 and -3.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper we study the collective breathing oscillations in the deformed traps. The oscillations\ncontain the four kinds of the oscillation, ITB, OTB, ILB and OLB modes. When the shape of the\ntraps are largely deformed, either oblate or prolate, these modes are decoupled. As this shape becomes\nclose to being spherical, the transverse and longitudinal modes are coupled, and make the monopole\nand quadrupole oscillations. The borders between these coupling and decoupling are at dT L \u2248 d1 and\ndT L \u2248 d2 , where the OTB and ILB modes make level crossing.\nIn the deformed traps the frequencies of the ITB and ILB modes agree with twice of the trap frequencies\nand are not so different from those of the non-interacting system. The frequencies of the OTB and OLB\nmodes show some coupling dependence and give information of the interaction, Their qualitative behaviors\nare however similar to those in the dipole oscillation [7].\nIn the semi-spherical traps, on the other hand, the collective oscillations exhibit more complicated behavior because of the level mixing. Hence we can get significant information on many body system of fermi\ngas by investigate breathing oscillations with the various fermion-fermion couplings and deformations of\nthe trap near being spherical (0.4 . \u03c9L /\u03c9T . 1.6).\nIn this work we do not discuss extremely deformed system (\u03c9T \u2192 \u221e or \u03c9L \u2192 \u221e). In such extreme\nconditions the system becomes a quasi-low dimension one [14], and the collective oscillation can be\nexpected to show quite different behaviors from those in our work [15].\n\n\f10\n\n[1] For reviews, see: A.S.
