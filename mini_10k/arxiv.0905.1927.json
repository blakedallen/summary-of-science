INTRODUCTION\nComets formed relatively far from the Sun, beyond the \"frost line,\" and they reside for\nlong periods of time in the outer Solar System. Their abundances can therefore provide\nclues to the formation and evolution of the Solar System. The original structures and\ncompositions of ices contained within their nuclei (i.e., native ices) should reflect local\nconditions (chemistry, temperature, degree of radiation processing) prevalent when and\nwhere they formed (e.g., DiSanti and Mumma 2008, Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2004, Irvine\net al. 2000, Mumma et al. 1993). Although comets contain relatively primitive icy\nmaterial remaining from the epoch of Solar System formation, the extent to which they\nare modified from their initial state is a fundamental question in cometary science.\nThe current orbits of comets provide information on their recent dynamical\nhistory, however tracing cometary origins is complicated by their radial migration in the\nproto-planetary disk and by dynamical interactions with the growing giant planets\n(Levison and Morbidelli 2003, Gomes et al. 20055, Tsinganis et al. 20055, Morbidelli et\nal. 2008). Such interactions placed comets into (at least) two principal present-day\nreservoirs: the Oort cloud (OC) and the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt (KB), thought to be the\nprincipal source regions for \"nearly-isotropic\" (long-period, dynamically-new, and\nHalley-type) comets and \"ecliptic\" (e.g., Jupiter-family) comets (JFCs), respectively.\nComet nuclei remain largely unaltered until perturbed into the inner Solar System (Stern\n2003, Gladman 2005), at which time sublimation of surface (or near-surface) native ices\nreleases parent volatiles into the coma where they can be measured spectroscopically.\nSpectroscopic investigations reveal chemical diversity among comets, based on\nstudies of parent volatiles at infrared (e.g., Mumma et al. 2003, DiSanti and Mumma\n2008) and radio wavelengths (e.g., Biver et al. 2002), implying a range of natal\nconditions experienced by pre-cometary ices (see also Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2004).\nFundamental clues to natal conditions can be provided both by measuring native ice\nabundances within an individual comet, and by building a taxonomy through\ncompositional comparisons among comets from both OC and KB populations.\nThis paper combines post-perihelion infrared and millimeter spectral\nobservations of the long-period comet C/2006 M4 SWAN (hereafter C/2006 M4) that\ncharacterize its native ice composition. Discovered on 20 June 2006 with the Solar Wind\nANisotropy instrument (SWAN) of the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (Matson and\nMattiazzo 2006 IAUC 8729), C/2006 M4 was initially assigned an eccentricity e = 1.0\n\n5\n\nIn particular, these papers detail the recently developed \"Nice Model.\"\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 4 of 27\n\nbased on 39 observations spanning 12-21 July 2006 (Teamo and Hoenig 2006 IAUC\n8733; see also MPEC 2006-N38).\nInclusion of additional astrometric observations led to a slightly hyperbolic orbit\n(see JPL's HORIZONS website: url http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi), suggesting that\nC/2006 M4 may be entering the solar system for the first time (i.e., that it may be\ndynamically new). However, the original value for 1/a (0.000194 AU-1; Nakano 2008)\nplaces its aphelion at 1.03x104 AU, indicating a dynamical origin in the inner Oort cloud\nreservoir and calling into question its dynamical status (returning long-period versus\nnew). In any case, our observations occurred post-perihelion, so even if dynamically new\nany radiation (or cosmic ray) processed outer layers (over its residence time in the Oort\ncloud) would likely have been lost through erosion prior to our observations, making our\nmeasurements a probe of less processed underlying material.\nVisual estimates projected C/2006 M4 to reach magnitude 6 (or brighter) by mid\nOctober 2006 (IAUC 8766; CBET 738), however it experienced approximately a 1.5-2magnitude surge in brightness around 24 October, followed by a sharp decline (Yoshida\n2007); we incorporate this into our analysis in Section 4.2. Optical imaging revealed a\nprominent ion tail but no discernable dust tail, suggesting that the observed coma was\ncomposed primarily of gaseous species. This made C/2006 M4 a good target for our\nstudy.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n2.1 Target-of-opportunity observations at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility\nThe comet was discovered after the normal application deadline for the Fall 2006\nproposal cycle. A target-of-opportunity request was submitted to use the long slit\nCryogenic Echelle Spectrometer (CSHELL; Tokunaga et al. 1990) at the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility on Mauna Kea, HI, based on its favorable geocentric velocity (see\nTable 1) and (especially) its availability during daylight hours since night time observing\nwas fully scheduled.\nA total of eleven hours of clock time were granted at the IRTF. We used\nCSHELL with a 1 arc-second-wide slit, resulting in a spectral resolving power (\u03bb/\u0394\u03bb) of\n~ 25,000 that permitted studies of individual line intensities. Flux calibration was\nachieved through observations of the IR standard star BS7235 using a wide (4 arcsecond) slit.\nThe CSHELL observations targeted specific emissions from CO, CH4, C2H6, and\nCH3OH, and these were measured simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with H2O (or\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 5 of 27\n\nits proxy OH*) to ensure reliable mixing ratios between trace constituents and water (Fig.\n1). The significant geocentric velocity (\u0394-dot) of C/2006 M4 displaced its lines of CH4\nand CO from their opaque telluric counterparts to regions of exceptionally high\natmospheric transmittance (80 \u2013 90 percent).\n[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]\nMeasuring HCN in comets represents a principal means of probing nitrogen\nchemistry in the early solar system, and is fairly routine with modern infrared\nspectrometers, even in less productive comets (see, e.g., Magee-Sauer et al. 1999, MageeSauer et al. 2002, Mumma et al. 2003, Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2004, Magee-Sauer et al.\n2008, DiSanti and Mumma 2008, and references therein). Our observing plan included a\nCSHELL setting that targets both HCN and C2H2. However, we were unable to utilize it\ndue to the extremely limited amount of observing time available for C/2006 M4,\nespecially considering that a stringent test of abundances (particularly that of C2H2)\nwould have required a time on source comparable to that spent on the setting that samples\nH2O emission near 3450 cm-1 (Table 1).\nWe used the standard ABBA observing sequence, with an east-west (along-slit)\nnod of 15 arc-seconds (half the slit length) between A- and B-beam positions (e.g., see\ndiscussions in Dello Russo et al. 2004, DiSanti et al. 2006). The observations were\nconducted during daylight, so the CSHELL CCD guider could not be used. Instead,\nfollowing every 1 \u2013 2 ABBA sequences (approximately 5 \u2013 10 minutes of clock time) the\ncomet was imaged through the CSHELL open (30 x 30 arc-second) aperture, to reposition it in the slit and to update tracking rates as warranted. Cometary drift was\ngenerally 1 \u2013 2 arc-seconds or less (approximately commensurate with the seeing\nconditions), and was primarily along the length of the slit. This preserved cometary\nsignal in the slit and made it possible (upon reduction), based on temporal interpolation\nof comet positions in the images, to spatially register all A and B scans separately prior to\ncombining them.\nThe low dust continuum emission made imaging the comet during daytime\nchallenging. We found that its visibility peaked near 3.52 \u03bcm, corresponding to the\napproximate center of the CH3OH \u03bd3 band (with Q-branch at 3.516 \u03bcm, or 2844 cm-1), as\nmethanol was relatively abundant in C/2006 M4 (see below) and so contributed most of\nthe intensity at this wavelength. To minimize potential shifts in wavelength calibration\nand mismatches in flat fielding, the echelle grating was kept stationary for the duration of\neach given setting. The CSHELL low resolution (\u03bb/\u0394\u03bb ~ 80) circular variable filter (used\nfor transmitting only the desired echelle order) was tuned to 2844 cm-1 for imaging the\ncomet between spectral sequences.\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 6 of 27\n\n[INSERT TABLE 1]\n2.2 Millimeter observations with ARO 12-m telescope\nObservations of C/2006 M4 were conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO)\n12-m telescope on Kitt Peak, AZ (Table 1). The ARO 12-m observations targeting HCN\nand CS in C/2006 M4 were conducted during several observing runs spanning 2006\nOctober 30 to November 10. Dual-channel SIS mixers operated in single-sideband mode\nwith image rejection around 20 dB were employed in the 2 mm (for the J = 3 \u2013 2\ntransition of CS) and 3 mm (for J = 1 \u2013 0 of HCN) bands, and filter banks having\nresolutions of 250 and 100 kHz, respectively, were used as back-ends. The spectral\ntemperature scale was determined by the chopper-wheel method, corrected for forward\nspillover losses, and is given in terms of antenna temperature, TR* (K). The radiation (or\nequivalent brightness) temperature, TR, is then derived from the corrected beam\nefficiency, \u03b7c, as TR = TR*/\u03b7c. The ephemeris employed was JPL reference orbits #10 for\nOctober and #11 for November. Nearby planets were used to check focus and positional\naccuracy at regular intervals. Data were taken in position-switching mode with the off\nposition located +30 arc-minutes west in azimuth. HCN and CS were clearly detected in\nthe millimeter observations (Fig. 2).\nAt millimeter wavelengths, HCN is the standard against which abundances of\nother cometary volatiles (both parent and daughter species) are measured, and the limited\nobserving time available for C/2006 M4 with CSHELL made the millimeter observations\nof paramount importance.

The dimensionless factor qscale accounts for loss of flux due to aperture effects or\nbeam dilution.\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 7 of 27\n\n3.1 Production rates from infrared spectra\nWe used customized IR data processing algorithms to produce orthogonal spatial-spectral\nframes from the raw CSHELL data (Villanueva et al. 2006, DiSanti et al. 2006, DiSanti\net al. 2001). Wavelength calibration was applied to these processed data through\ncomparison of observed sky radiance with spectra synthesized using a rigorous line-byline, layer-by-layer radiative transfer model of the terrestrial atmosphere (GENLN2,\nEdwards 1992). We updated this model to properly include pressure-shift coefficients\nalong with the latest spectroscopic parameters (Villanueva et al. 2008).\nAssuming optically thin conditions, column densities were determined from the\nCSHELL data using line fluxes (Fline, W m-2), corrected for atmospheric transmittance at\neach Doppler-shifted line frequency, and fluorescence g-factors (W molecule-1):\n\nN IR =\n\n4 \u03c0 Fline\nR 2h ,\n\u03a9 gline,1AU\n\n(2)\n\nin which \u03a9 (ster) is the solid angle subtended by the beam \u2013 we used 15-row spectral\nextracts (i.e., a 1x3 arc-second aperture) centered on the nucleus for our analysis. This\n\u20ac\ntranslated to approximately\n800x2400 km at the comet on UT November 7, and 840x2500\nkm on November 10. For the CSHELL observations, the fraction f(x) in Eq. 1 is calculated\nfor square pixels (with x being the ratio of pixel size to photo-dissociation scale length; see\nthe Appendix of Hoban et al. 1991 for details) assuming constant gas production and\nuniform outflow at constant speed (taken to be 800 Rh-0.5 m s-1, consistent with line widths\nmeasured in the ARO spectra; see below).\nThe factor qscale (> 1 for our CSHELL observations) corrects for slit losses due to\nseeing and to potential drift of the comet arising from uncorrected errors in telescope\ntracking, in particular as arise from (slight) drift perpendicular to the slit. The production\nrate corresponding to qscale = 1.0 is referred to as the nucleus-centered Q; qscale is typically\ndetermined from the sum of spatial profiles for several lines because this summed profile\nhas higher signal-to-noise compared with individual line profiles. Applying qscale to the\nnucleus-centered Q for each line yields its global Q. The overall molecular production rate\nis then the weighted mean of line-by-line global Qs (Table 2). The methodology for\ndetermining molecular production rates is detailed in the literature (e.g., Magee-Sauer et al.\n1999, Dello Russo et al. 2000, DiSanti et al. 2001, DiSanti et al. 2006, Magee-Sauer et al.\n2002, Bonev 2005).\n[INSERT TABLE 2]\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 8 of 27\n\n3.2 Production rates from millimeter observations\nAbundances for HCN and CS were derived from the ARO 12-m observations assuming\nthe source filled the (circular) beam of the telescope. Again assuming the emissions to be\noptically thin (based on intensities of HCN hyperfine components; see Fig. 2A), the\ncolumn density was calculated as:\nN radio =\n\n3k\n3\n\n\u222b T dv\nR\n2\n\uf06f\n\n\u03b6\n\n1/ 2 rot\n\u2212E j / kT rot\nj\n\n8\u03c0 \u03bd Sij \u03bc g e\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nin which \u03bd (MHz) is the frequency, \u222b TRdv1/2 (K km s-1) represents the integrated intensity\ncorrected for main beam efficiency, Sij\u03bco2 is the line strength (\u03bco being the permanent\n\u20ac\ndipole moment,\nin Debye), \u03b6rot is the rotational partition function, and g j and Ej are\nrespectively the statistical weight and energy of the upper rotational state.\nFor the millimeter observations, the factor Abeam from Eq. 1 is given by\n\u03c0(Dbeam/2)2, where the beam diameter Dbeam = \u0394 tan(1.22\u03bb/Dtel)\u20acand Dtel = 12 m; this\ntranslates to approximately Dbeam = 5.44 x 104 km at the comet for the HCN observations\nand 3.28 x 104 km for the CS observations. Assuming the source fills the beam, qscale =\n1.0 and, if solely native production and spherically-symmetric gas outflow at constant\nspeed in the coma are assumed, f(x) can be calculated following Yamamoto (1982).\nUsing a Monte Carlo formalism (as was done here) results in essentially the same\nproduction rates as those given by the strictly spherically-symmetric case. Terrestrial\natmospheric opacity is included in the calibration of the millimeter observations.\nHCN and CS were assumed to be parent species, and their production rates were\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo model for a purely native source (Milam et al. 2006;\nRemijan et al. 2008). The model traces the trajectories of molecules that are ejected from\nthe comet surface and enter the telescope beam. Input parameters include molecular\nlifetime, gas outflow velocity, telescope beam size, and observed column density. From\nour line profiles (Fig. 2) we measured outflow velocities of ~ 730 m s-1 and ~ 1000 m s-1\nrespectively for HCN and CS, and adopt 800 Rh-0.5 m s-1 in our analysis, as stated\npreviously.\nIf CS is a photo-destruction product of CS2 (Snyder et al. 2001), only slight\nadjustments to the input parameters are introduced in calculating Q. Under this\nassumption, lifetimes and velocities of both parent (CS2) and daughter (CS) are used,\nwhile other input parameters are held unchanged from their values assuming CS itself is a\nparent species. Because CS2 has a very short photo-dissociation scale length (~ 300 km,\ncorresponding to \u03c4 ~ 370 Rh2 s; Huebner et al. 1992), much smaller than the beam radius\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 9 of 27\n\n(1.64 x 104 km), this translates to a negligible change in QCS compared with its value\nassuming CS to be a parent.\n[INSERT TABLE 3]\n3.3 Rotational temperatures\nFor both the CSHELL and ARO observations, a small number of lines were measured.\nFor this reason, knowledge of rotational temperature (Trot) in the coma is needed to\nestablish the population distribution among rotational levels and thereby determine\naccurate column densities from measured line intensities. (The dependence on Trot is\n\u2212E / kT\nexplicitly manifested through gline in Eq. 2, and through e j rot / \u03b6 rot in Eq. 3.)\nObtaining a reliable measure of Trot requires measuring lines that sample a range\nin rotational energy. Because each CSHELL setting encompasses a limited spectral\n\u20ac number),\n\u20ac and also due to the limited\nrange (approximately 0.23% of the central wave\nIRTF time available to measure the chemistry of C/2006 M4, only the 3452 cm-1 water\nsetting satisfied this criterion \u2013 we measured Trot = 77 +29/-14 K for H2O on November 10,\nbased on four lines sampling rotational energies ranging from ~ 40 \u2013 400 cm-1 (see inset\nto Fig. 1E). We therefore adopt Trot = 80 K in reporting global production rates for\nmolecules observed with CSHELL (Table-2), and list column densities and production\nrates for HCN and CS assuming 60, 80, and 100 K (Table 3). In Table 4, we report\nmixing ratios (i.e., abundances relative to H2O) for 60, 80, and 100 K for species\nmeasured with CSHELL. For HCN and CS, we present mixing ratios for 60 and 80 K,\nincorporating differences in estimated overall gas production between ARO and\nCSHELL observations resulting from the reported outburst (see Section 4.2).\n4. DISCUSSION\nOur combined IR and millimeter results reveal an interesting parent volatile composition\nfor C/2006 M4. Some intriguing possibilities for the processing history of its precometary ices emerge, particularly when compared with other comets previously\ncharacterized. A comparison among comets provides a context for inferring where\n(perhaps also when, for how long, and/or to what degree) processing occurred.\n4.1. Dependence of abundances on rotational temperature\nIn Table 4 we list mixing ratios (abundances relative to H2O) at Trot = 60, 80, and 100 K\nfor CO, C2H6, CH3OH, and CH4 in C/2006 M4. The abundances of CO, C2H6, and\nCH3OH are independent of assumed rotational temperature to well within 1\u03c3 uncertainty.\nThis is primarily because the settings targeting their emissions include multiple lines that\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 10 of 27\n\nsample a range of rotational energies. The abundance of CH4 is somewhat more sensitive\nto Trot, as is that of HCN (Table 4).\n[INSERT FIGURE 3]\nAssuming Trot for the ARO observations agrees with that measured with CSHELL\nfor H2O, the abundance of HCN can be expressed relative to the weighted mean of H2O\nproduction rates for November 7, 9, and 10 (Fig. 3), however this comparison is\ncomplicated. The aperture for CSHELL (~ 800 x 2400 km; Section 3.1) is small\ncompared with the ARO beam sizes (5.4 x 104 km for HCN, 3.3 x 104 km for CS; Section\n3.2), so we must allow for possible differences in beam-averaged Trot. Perhaps more\nsignificantly, the ratio HCN/H2O cannot be adequately assessed without also accounting\nfor differences in modeled water production rate between times of ARO and CSHELL\nobservations due to the decaying outburst (Table 4 note e, Fig. 4, and Section 4.2). The\nabundance of CS is expressed relative to HCN (see Section 4.4) as is customary with\nmillimeter observations (Biver et al. 2002, Biver et al. 2006; see Section 4.4).\n[INSERT TABLE 4]\n4.2. Accounting for temporal variability\nThe temporal coverage of HCN and CS with ARO encompassed that of the CSHELL\nobservations (Table 1), however three of the four dates on which HCN was observed and\ntwo of four dates on which CS was observed were prior to our CSHELL run. C/2006 M4\nexperienced a significant outburst on UT 24 October followed by a steep decline in\nactivity (see Yoshida 2007). Therefore, we also report a mixing ratios for HCN and CS\nbased on the estimated contemporaneous H2O production rate for each.\nTo accomplish this, we reproduced the light curve of C/2006 M4 using fitted\nexpressions that relate its visual magnitude to Rh and \u0394 (Yoshida 2007). We then applied\nthe expression (Jorda et al. 2008) relating Q(H2O) to visual magnitude (reduced to \u0394 = 1\nAU) based on 234 measurements in 37 comets. The resulting \"activity curve\" is shown\nin Fig. 4 \u2013 we note that our points from Fig. 3 are grouped tightly about this fit. Based on\nthe weighted mean UT date for the HCN observations (November 3.0), this suggests a\ncommensurate fitted value of Q(H2O) = 2.05 x 1029 molecules s-1. We list our \"most\nprobable\" HCN abundance (0.13 \u00b1 0.02 percent), assuming Trot = 60 K for HCN and Trot\n= 80 K for H2O. For comparison, we also list its abundance assuming both HCN and\nH2O are characterized by Trot = 80 K (see Table 4, note 'e'). Therefore, unless Trot for\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 11 of 27\n\nHCN is well above 100 K (which seems very unlikely), HCN is depleted in C/2006 M4\ncompared with its \"normal\" abundance as measured in the IR (see discussion in Section\n4.4).\nHowever, our most probable mixing ratio for HCN is consistent with values found\nfor the majority of 24 comets observed at millimeter wavelengths (see Figs. 1 and 2 of\nBiver et al. 2002, and Section 4.4). This may reflect what appears to be differences\nbetween HCN abundances derived from IR and millimeter observations, the latter being\nsystematically lower by a factor of ~ 2 among measured comets (e.g., see Magee-Sauer et\nal. 2008, and references therein). This can be tested through coordinated observations.\n[INSERT FIGURE 4]\n4.3. Relation to the chemistry of oxidized carbon\nAn important recognized path for converting CO to the chemically linked molecules\nH2CO and CH3OH is H-atom addition reactions on surfaces of icy interstellar grains prior\nto their incorporation into the nuclei of comets (Hudson and Moore 1999, Watanabe and\nKouchi 2002, Hiraoka et al. 2002, Watanabe et al. 2004). This process is analogous to\nproduction of cometary ethane through hydrogenation of C2H2, proposed to explain the\nrelatively high abundance of C2H6 to CH4 first observed in C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake)\n(Mumma et al. 1996). Subsequent studies routinely reveal high C2H6 abundances in\ncomets, orders of magnitude higher than the amount of C2H6 produced through gas phase\nnebular chemistry (Prinn and Fegley 1989). This demonstrates that H-atom addition is\nlikely a common and important process in the evolution of such grains.\nLaboratory experiments show hydrogenation of CO to be efficient only at very\nlow temperatures (~-10-\u2013-20-K), the yields being highly dependent on fluence (i.e.,\ndensity) of atomic hydrogen, temperature (i.e., H-atom retention time), and whether CO\nis housed structurally with H2O in the ice (e.g., see Watanabe et al. 2004). One measure\nof this conversion can be represented by the sum of H2CO and CH3OH abundances\ndivided by the sum of all three abundances (DiSanti et al. 2002).\nDue to the limited amount of available observing time, we were unable to observe\nH2CO in C/2006 M4. Despite this, the severely depleted abundance of CO coupled with\nsomewhat enriched CH3OH (Table 4) suggests highly efficient conversion of CO,\napproximately 90 percent or higher -- note that, by the above definition, the presence of\nnon-negligible H2CO would further increase the conversion efficiency. This measure\nassumes that all CO converts to H2CO or CH3OH, and that these two molecules arise\nsolely from H-atom addition to CO, thereby representing a limiting case.\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 12 of 27\n\nThis interpretation of measured abundances may be compromised if icy grains in\nthe inner proto-solar nebula were thermally processed prior to their final incorporation\ninto the nucleus. It is possible that the grains incorporated into C/2006 M4 originally had\na higher endowment of CO that later was preferentially lost through vaporization in\nsubsequent warmer nebular environs. In this case one might also expect depletion of the\nonly slightly less volatile CH4, however methane falls in the \"normal\" range in this comet\n(Table 4). Alternatively, some fraction of the initial CO budget may subsequently have\nbeen locked up in complex organic material, for example the \"CHON\" particles\ndiscovered during the Giotto encounter with comet 1P/Halley (Kissel et al. 1986;\nHuebner 1987; Mitchell et al. 1987; Milam et al. 2006). The very weak observed optical\n/ IR continuum in C/2006 M4 implies a low abundance of approximately micron-sized\ngrains, so a commensurate paucity of smaller grains (e.g., CHON) might be expected. In\nany case, observed and primordial (pre-cometary) abundances of CO could differ\nsubstantially, and our measured conversion efficiency may reflect processing history of\nices more than natal conditions in the proto-solar cloud.\nInter-comparison of abundances for CO, H2CO, and CH3OH in comets, molecular\ndisks around young stars, and proto-stellar cloud cores would be particularly valuable for\nunderstanding the (potential) processing (chemical and/or thermal) experienced by\norganic matter during different stages of planetary system formation. However, such\nstudies are beyond the scope of the present paper.\n4.4. Abundance comparisons with other comets\nComparisons among comets suggest interesting possibilities. The molecules in Table 4\nare listed from left to right in order of increasing vacuum sublimation temperature. We\narbitrarily adopt the following classifications for mixing ratios relative to those measured\nin four OC comets (which we refer to tentatively as \"organics-normal\" comets; see notes\n'a' and 'f' in Table 4). \"Severely\" refers to values that are three standard deviations (3\u03c3)\nor more and more than a factor of two from normal, while \"slightly\" (or \"somewhat\")\nrefers to values between 1\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 or within a factor of two from normal. A range of\nnative ice compositions is seen even among the small number of comets measured in\ndetail (about two dozen between IR and millimeter regimes; Mumma et al. 2003,\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2004, Crovisier 2007, DiSanti and Mumma 2008 and references\ntherein)6.\nOrganics-normal comets show chemical signatures similar to (although not\nidentical to) those observed in dense interstellar clouds (Mumma et al. 2003; Bockel\u00e9e6\n\nNote that these classifications are based on small number statistics.\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 13 of 27\n\nMorvan et al. 2004; Charnley and Rodgers 2008), suggesting the ices incorporated into\nthe nuclei of these comets experienced processing at low temperatures. Compared with\nthe composition-normal group of comets, our measurements of C/2006 M4 indicate\nseverely depleted CO and somewhat enriched CH3OH, while CH4 and C2H6 are consistent\nwith normal. After accounting for estimated differences in gas production between IRTF\nand ARO observations (Fig. 4), our abundance of HCN is somewhat depleted relative to\nnormal IR values in comets but is consistent with that found in the majority of comets\nmeasured at millimeter wavelengths (see Table 4, note 'e'), which cluster near HCN/H2O\n~ 0.1 percent (see Figs. 1 and 2 in Biver et al. 2002). Our abundance ratio CS/HCN is\n0.63\u00b10.101 and 0.59\u00b10.094 for Trot = 60 K and 80 K, respectively; this incorporates\ndifferences in the mean UT for HCN and CS observations assuming their production\nrates track that estimated for H2O (Fig. 4). The ratio CS/HCN in C/2006 M4 falls within\nthe range (0.5 \u2013 1.2) measured at millimeter wavelengths in nine of 24 comets (Biver et\nal. 2002) plus 153P/Ikeya-Zhang (Biver et al. 2006). Of these ten comets, seven have\nprobable Oort cloud origin and three are JFCs.\nThe hyper-volatiles CO and CH4 exhibit the largest variations in abundance\namong comets, however they are not correlated, demonstrating that thermal\nconsiderations alone cannot explain molecular abundances in comets (Gibb et al. 2003).\nFully interpreting the large variation in CO abundances among comets involves\ndistinguishing the amount initially condensed onto grains versus the degree of subsequent\nalteration, for example through H-atom addition or incorporation into complex molecules\nas discussed previously.\nInspection of Table 4 shows that our abundances of CO and CH3OH in C/2006\nM4 were very similar to those in Comet 8P/Tuttle (B\u00f6hnhardt et al. 2008), the\ncomposition of which also suggested highly efficient conversion of C2H2 to C2H6\n(exceeding 85%). (Because C2H2 was not measured in C/2006 M4, this comparison is\nnot possible.) However, C/2006 M4 had normal abundances of CH4 and C2H6, 2 \u2013 3\ntimes higher than their corresponding values in 8P/Tuttle (Bonev et al. 2008; B\u00f6hnhardt\net al. 2008). Provided our \"most probable\" abundance for HCN in C/2006 M4 is valid,\nthis makes HCN only somewhat less depleted than its value in Comet Tuttle (Bonev et al.\n2008), notwithstanding the systematic difference between HCN abundances based on IR\nand millimeter observations mentioned previously (Section 4.2). We note that\npreliminary results from IRAM and CSO measurements (Biver et al. 2008a) place the\nabundance of HCN in 8P/Tuttle towards the low end of the distribution measured among\ncomets.\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 14 of 27\n\nLow CO abundances were also observed in long-period comet C/1999 S4\n(LINEAR) and JFC 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, however in contrast to C/2006 M4\nthese comets showed severe depletions in most parent volatiles, including CH3OH but not\nHCN (Mumma et al. 2001, Villanueva et al. 2006, Kobayashi et al. 2007, Dello Russo et\nal. 2007, DiSanti et al. 2007a). Enriched abundances were observed in long-period comet\nC/2001 A2 (Biver et al. 2006, Gibb et al. 2007, Magee-Sauer et al. 2008), and more\nrecently in JFC 17P/Holmes during its sudden outburst in October/November 2007\n(Salyk et al. 2007, Dello Russo et al. 2008, Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan 2008, Biver et al. 2008b),\nsuggesting a more nearly interstellar chemistry. For both relatively depleted and enriched\ncomets, this demonstrates that compositional similarities exist between comets that likely\ncome from different dynamical reservoirs (OC for C/1999 S4 and C/2001 A2, KB for\n73P and 17P), and suggests distinct processing histories for depleted, organics-normal,\nand enriched comets. Our results for C/2006 M4 appear to be most closely in line with\nthe normal group of comets, although differences exist as discussed above.\nIf formation temperatures were comparable to those experienced by organicsnormal comets, and assuming H-atom addition dominates conversion of CO (see Section\n4.3), it is possible that the higher CH3OH/CO ratio in C/2006 M4 implies a greater\navailability (e.g., a higher density) of atomic hydrogen in its formation environment.\nAlternatively, H-atom addition reactions could have taken place over a longer period of\ntime in the case of C/2006 M4, leading to excess methanol at the expense of CO.\n5. SUMMARY\nWe conducted post-perihelion observations of parent volatiles in the long-period comet\nC/2006 M4 (SWAN) on three UT dates using CSHELL at the NASA-Infrared Telescope\nFacility 3-m telescope, and on seven UT dates using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12m telescope. Our measured abundances for C2H6, CH4, HCN, CO, CH3OH, and CS were\ncompared to their values in other comets, as part of our ongoing efforts to build a\ntaxonomy based on composition. The values for C2H6 and CH4 were consistent with\nthose found in the organics-normal class of comets. After accounting for differences in\noverall cometary activity between millimeter and infrared (H2O) observations, HCN was\nsomewhat depleted compared with its abundance in most comets observed in the IR.\nHowever, it was consistent with that measured in the majority of comets at millimeter\nwavelengths, as was CS/HCN based on its value measured in ten comets. Compared with\nthe organics-normal group, CO was severely depleted (by a factor of four or more) while\nCH3OH was somewhat enriched (by about 50 percent), and their abundances were\nconsistent with those measured in the Halley-family comet 8P/Tuttle. The large\nabundance ratio CH3OH/CO may indicate highly efficient H-atom addition reactions on\n\n\fUnedited Preprint, Accepted for Publication in Icarus, 11 May 2009\n\npage 15 of 27\n\npre-cometary grain surfaces, provided that CO was not subsequently lost through nebular\nprocessing and/or locked up in more complex material such as CHON grains. Assuming\nmeasured abundances reflect processing at very low temperature (~ 10 \u2013 20 K), then\ncompared with organics-normal comets this may indicate larger hydrogen densities in the\nnascent environment of C/2006 M4, or alternatively that its pre-cometary ices\nexperienced surface chemistry over a longer period of time.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the NASA Planetary Astronomy (RTOP 344-32-98) and\nAstrobiology (RTOP 344-53-51) Programs.

Uncertainties represent 1\u03c3, and upper limits represent 3\u03c3.\nHeavy (shaded red) and light (pink) solid boxes indicate respectively severely and slightly\nenriched abundances, and heavy (green) and light (yellow) dashed boxes indicate severely and\nslightly depleted abundances compared with abundances measured for the majority of Oort cloud\ncomets (see \u00a74.4). Unless otherwise noted, abundances are taken from DiSanti and Mumma\n(2008) and Mumma et al. (2003), and the original papers referenced therein should be cited.\nb\nValues for CO pertain to release solely from the nucleus (i.e., the native source).\nc\nVacuum sublimation/condensation temperatures (Yamamoto 1985; Crovisier 2007).\nd\nThis work. Values represent mean mixing ratios for all dates measured. Uncertainties include\nthose in \u0393 and qscale (Table 2), except when co-measured with H2O, as are CO in the 2152 cm-1\nsetting and CH4 in the 3041 cm-1 setting (co-measured with OH*; Fig. 1D). Values for CH4 and\nCH3OH from November 10 incorporate the mean Q(H2O) as calculated from H2O in the 3452\ncm-1 setting and from OH* in the 3041 cm-1 setting.\ne\nThis work. These entries use the contemporaneous value for Q(H2O) estimated from the activity\ncurve of Fig. 4. For our \"most probable\" abundance for HCN, we take Trot = 80 K for H2O and\n60 K for HCN, resulting in a mixing ratio of 0.126 percent as shown (see text).\nf\nRefers to the mean of values for four OC comets (C/1996 B2 Hyakutake, C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp,\nC/1999 H1 Lee, and 153P/Ikeya-Zhang) having similar abundances for C2H6, C2H2, HCN, and\nCH3OH (for abundances in individual comets, see Mumma et al. 2003). A range of values is\nlisted for CO and CH4 because the mean dispersion in their abundances among these comets (i.e.,\ntheir standard distribution about the mean, or the standard error) is more than twice the error in\nthe mean associated with their individual uncertainties of each value (the stochastic error). For\nC2H6, C2H2, HCN, and CH3OH, the mean and the larger of stochastic and standard errors are\nlisted.\ng\nB\u00f6hnhardt et al. (2008); h Mean of abundances from B\u00f6hnhardt et al.
