Introduction\nElectromagnetic surface waves (SW) [1] provides\nus with new possibilities of engineering photonic devices and optical applications. Due to their purely twodimensional character of propagation they are predetermined to be used in the field of planar optics. The main\nconstrain in the application of electromagnetic surface\nwaves are radiation losses due to the scattering of the\nwave at surface inhomogeneities. The transmission of\nthe surface plasmon through a single permittivity step\n[2, 3] might be accompanied with the excitation of the\nbroad spectra of plane waves. The surface wave can\nlose more than 40% of its energy. This instability of\nthe surface wave represents a strong constrain in the development of a surface wave optics since constructing\noptical devices based on multiple interfaces is rather ineffective.\nThe TM surface waves are excited at the metal dielectric interface, where the dielectric permittivity \u01eb\nchanges its sign [5, 6]. The construction of new metamaterials with negative magnetic permeability [7] opens\na possibility to study also TE surface waves [8, 6]. In\nthis letter, we show that radiation losses due to the propagation of the TE waves at the surface of negative permeability material are three orders of magnitude smaller\nthan that for the TM wave at the metal-dielectric surface.\n\nEmail address: peter.markos@stuba.sk (Peter Marko\u0161)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n2.

The interface between the two dielectrics is\nlocated in the x = 0 plane, and creates the permittivity\nstep: \u01ebd (x) = \u01eb1 (x < 0) and = \u01eb2 (x > 0). Our aim is\nto calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients\nof the TE SW propagating through this permittivity discontinuity.\nTo compare the obtained data with those for the\nTM SW at the metal-dielectric interface, we consider\nthe lossles Drude formula for the permittivity of metal\n\u01ebmetal (\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 \u03c92p /\u03c92 and the same dispersion relation\nfor the permeability of NPM:\n\nand\nH j\u03b1\n\ni\n\uf8f1 h\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2212e\u2212ikz j\u03b1 z + r j\u03b1 eikz j\u03b1 z\nN j\u03b1\n\uf8f2\nh\ni\nkk \u00d7 \uf8f4\n=\n\uf8f3\nz0 k0 \u03b1 \uf8f4\n\u2212t j\u03b1 e\u2212ikzm j\u03b1 z /\u03bcm\n\nz>0\n(7)\nz < 0.\n\nti\u03b1 = (1 \u2212 ri\u03b1 ) and ri\u03b1 = (kzmi\u03b1 \u2212 kz\u03b1 \u03bcm )/(kzmi\u03b1 + kzi\u03b1 \u03bcm )\nare transmission and reflection amplitudes for the plane\nwave \u03b1 incident at the interface of ith dielectric and\nNPM.\nIn what follows, we use the matrix\nZ \u221e\nij\nEi\u03b1 H j\u03b2 dydz.\n(8)\nC\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\u2212\u221e\n\nii\nThe requirement C\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 determines the normalization constants Ni\u03b1 .

Also, we assume \u03bcmetal = 1 (nonmagnetic) and \u01ebNPM = 1 for our NPM. This choice of\nparameters give us clear confrontation between behavior of the TM and TE SW on the surface of metal and\nof NPM.

Owing to the nonhomogeneous z dependence of electric and magnetic\nfield of the surface wave, the matching of the tangential components of the fields at the x = 0 interface is\npossible only with the assistance of plane waves. We\nconsider N plane waves with the same frequency \u03c9 and\ndifferent z components of the wave vector kz = kmax \u03b1,\n\u03b1 = 1, . . . N.

The transmission vanishes when approaching the critical angle given by (11) for sin \u03b82 = 1. Naturally, reflection must increase to one, as passing the\ncritical angle.\n\n4.3. Oblique angle incidence\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the dependence of the transmission, reflection and scattering losses on the angle of incidence.

The most important result is that the\nradiative losses due to the scattering are much smaller\nthan that for the TM surface wave propagating along the\nmetal-dielectric interface. Therefore, the TE polarized\nsurface wave is a very good candidate for applications\nin the two-dimensional optics.\n\n0.3\n\nFigure 4: Transmission, reflection and scattering losses for the TE\nsurface wave as a function of angle of incidence at the interface with\n\u01eb1 = 1, \u01eb2 = 6.

Dot-dashed line marks critical angle\nfor planar waves incident on interface between similar dielectrics and\ndashed line represents actual critical angle for the surface wave.\n\nThis work was supported by project APVV n. 51003505 and project VEGA 0633/09.\n\n4.4. Spatial distribution of the fields\nAs discussed above, the propagation of a surface\nwave through the interface is always accompanied by\nthe radiation of plane waves. The plane waves are necessary to balance the inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields of the surface waves. To explain the origin of\nextremely small radiation losses of the TE surface wave,\nwe plot in Fig. 5 the components of the wave vector for\nboth TM and TE surface waves. The main difference\nbetween the two waves lies in the permittivity dependence of \u03bad . Contrary to the TM wave, we find that \u03bad\ndepends only weakly on the dielectric permittivity for\nthe TE wave. Consequently, weak radiative fields are\nsufficient to correct the field discontinuity on both sides\nof the x = 0 interface, so that radiative losses are small.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. V. Zayats, I.
