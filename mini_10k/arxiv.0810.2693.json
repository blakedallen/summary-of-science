INTRODUCTION\nToday polarimetry is the sub-topic of X-Ray Astronomy for which we have the maximum gap between the\nexpectations deriving from theoretical analysis and the achievements deriving from experiments.1, 2 Indeed\nthis branch of astronomy has suffered limitations due to the lack of sensitivity of the previously flown X-ray\npolarimeters, based on the classical techniques of measurement, namely the Bragg diffraction at nearly 45 degrees\nand the Thomson scattering at nearly 90 degrees.\nThe development of new devices which can exploit the photoelectric effect to derive the polarization of the\nabsorbed photons has renewed the interest in this branch of X-ray astronomy. Their operation is based on\nthe reconstruction of the direction of emission of photoelectrons by means of pairs created by ionization in a\ngas. Since photoelectric absorption is intrinsically wide-band with respect to the Bragg diffraction and can be\nexploited at lower energies with respect to the Thomson scattering, this kind of devices are characterized by a\nfar higher sensitivity than the X-ray polarimeters built so far.\nThe detection of polarization requires a large number of photons (105 - 106 ) to reach minimum detectable\npolarizations of a few percent, i.e. in the range of interest for astrophysical sources. To reach a sufficient collecting\narea to perform measurements in a reasonable observing time, these devices can be efficiently employed with\nX-ray optics, and many proposals have been presented.3\u20135 Two profiles of missions are emerging:\nFurther author information: (Send correspondence to Fabio Muleri)\nFabio Muleri: E-mail: Fabio.Muleri@iasf-roma.inaf.it, Telephone: +39-0649934565\n\n\f\u2022 a pathfinder mission, with a medium X-ray optics, which could perform the study of galactic and bright\nextragalactic sources in a few days;\n\u2022 a large observatory, following the pathfinder mission, which could be dedicated to the study of the faint\nextragalactic sources with a large area.\nIn both cases, the detector is aligned with the optics, namely the photons are incident nearly orthogonally\nwith respect to the instrument. Then, the symmetry around the optical axis assures that systematic effects are\nnegligible, at least at first order.\nDespite this essential employment of photoelectric polarimeters has not been realized yet, new possibilities\nare already emerging. Indeed it has been proposed to employ this kind of polarimeters to build small and cheap\ninstruments with large field of view to perform polarimetry of transient and bright sources like Gamma Ray\nBurst.6\nIn this paper, we analyze the possible use of the Gas Pixel Detector, one of the most advanced project\nin the field of photoelectric polarimetry, as a large field of view instrument by means of theoretical analysis\nand measurements. We will explore the systematic effects arising when polarized and unpolarized photons are\nincident at large angle with respect to the perpendicular to the instrument, and will present some basic tools to\ndisentangle the systematics from the actual polarized response. The bases of this analysis were already presented\nby Muleri in 2005.7\n\n2. THE GAS PIXEL DETECTOR\n8\u201310\n\nThe Gas Pixel Detector,\ndeveloped by the INFN of Pisa, is one of the most advanced X-ray polarimeter\nbased on the photoelectric effect. It is basically a gas detector with fine 2-D position resolution, made of a gas\ncell with a beryllium X-ray window, a gas electron multiplier (GEM) and, below it, of a pixellated plane which\ncollects the charges generated in the gas. Its operating principle is shown in Fig. 1. When a photon crosses the\nthin beryllium window and is absorbed in the gas, a photoelectron is emitted preferentially along the electric\nfield of the absorbed photon, i.e. in the direction of polarization. As the photoelectron propagates, it is scattered\nby charges in the nuclei and loses its energy by ionization. Its path is traced by the generated electron-ion pairs,\nwhich are amplified by the GEM and collected on the fine sub-divided pixel detector. Hence the detector sees\nthe projection of the track of the photoelectron.\nWhen the incident radiation is linearly polarized, the histogram of the angles of emission of a large number\nof photoelectrons is modulated with an amplitude proportional to the degree of polarization. The Gas Pixel\nDetector derives the amplitude and the phase of this modulation by analyzing the projection of the track on the\ndetector and then reconstructing the angle of emission of each photoelectron.\nThis approach is successful only if the tracks are resolved by the detector in many pixels. Indeed, photoelectrons are subjected to nuclear scatterings in the gas and then the first part of the track must be resolved,\nsince it's the only part that carries memory of the polarization. Moreover, the ejection of the photoelectron is\nvery likely followed by the production of an Auger electron, which must be distinguished because its direction\nof emission is isotropic.\nThe current version of the GPD has 105k pixels with 50 \u03bcm pitch in a hexagonal pattern. The version\nemployed for the measurements reported below was filled and sealed with a mixture composed by 30% helium\nand 70% DME at 1 atm, with a gas cell 1 cm thick and the GEM at 400 \u03bcm from the detector. Since the helium\nis nearly transparent for photons at a few keV, the DME acts as quencher and absorber of photons.\n\n3. ANALYSIS OF THE PHOTOELECTRIC DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION\nThe direction of emission of a photoelectron carries memory of the polarization of the absorbed photon, namely\nthe probability that a photoelectron is emitted in the direction of polarization is modulated with a cos2 \u03c6 term,\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle between the direction of emission and polarization (see Fig. 2).\n\n\fFigure 1. Principle of operation of the GPD.\n\nIf we consider only the absorption of shells with spherical symmetry, i.e. 1s and 2s, which give the larger\ncontribution to the photoelectric absorption in the working condition of the GPD, the differential cross section\nof the photoelectric effect is:\nd\u03c3\nsin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03c6\n(1)\n\u221d\n4,\nd\u03a9\n(1 + \u03b2 cos \u03b8)\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the direction of the photon and that of the photoelectron (see again Fig. 2).\nz\nPlane orthogonal to the\ndirection of incidence\n\nPolarization\ny'\nx'\n\nIncoming\nPhoton\n\nPlane parallel to detector\n\n\u03b8\nConversion Point\n\n\u03c6\n\ny\n\nx\nPhotoelectron\n\nDetector\n\nFigure 2. Definition of the emission angle of photoelectrons.\n\nThe Eq. 1 includes the relativistic correction (1+\u03b2 1cos \u03b8)4 , where \u03b2 is the velocity of the emitted electron in\nunits of the speed of light. Without this relativistic correction, the photoelectrons are emitted preferentially into\nthe plane perpendicular to the direction of incidence, with a symmetry between the emission above and below\n\n\fthis plane. The lack of this symmetry induced by the relativistic correction makes the emission probability higher\nin the semi-space opposite with respect to the direction of photon. This effect of \"forward folding\" is shown in\nFig. 3, where the energy of photoelectrons is 50 keV to stress the relativistic effects. The photons are absorbed\nin the center of the sphere of unit radius, in the point (0,0,0), and the directions of emission of photoelectrons\nare traced by the red points which are concentrated in the semi-space z < 0. Note also that the projection of the\ndirections of emission on the xy plane is not changed by the relativistic effects, namely it still follows a cos2 \u03c6\ndependency and no photoelectrons are emitted orthogonally to the direction of polarization.\n\nFigure 3. Forward folding due to the relativistic correction to the differential photoelectric cross section. The direction\nof incidence of the photons is the black continuous line, while the direction of polarization is gray. The photons are\nabsorbed in the center of the sphere of unit radius, in the point (0,0,0), and the directions of emission of photoelectrons\nare traced with the red points on the sphere. The projection of the plot on the xy plane is also shown. The red, green\nand blue dashed lines are respectively the x, y and z axes. The energy of the photoelectrons was set to 50 keV to show\nthe relativistic effects more clearly.\n\nThe modulation of the direction of emission of photoelectrons, as measured by a polarimeter based on the\nphotoelectric effect like the GPD, can be derived from Eq. 1. At this aim, we must distinguish between the\nintrinsic modulation M\u20320 (\u03c6\u2032 ), namely the modulation in the reference frame x'y'z' of the photons (see Fig. 2 and\nFig. 4(b)), the intrinsic one in the reference of the detector xyz, M0 (\u03c6), and that measured by a polarimeter\nM(\u03c6).\nIf the hypothesis of absorption from only shells with spherical symmetry is satisfied, the modulation M\u20320 for\npolarized photons can be simply derived from Eq. 1 by integrating over angles \u03b8:\nZ \u03c0\nd\u03c3 \u2032\nsin2 \u03b8\u2032 cos2 \u03c6\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2 \u2032\npol\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(2)\nM0 (\u03c6 ) =\n\u221d\n4 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 \u221d cos \u03c6 ,\n\u2032\nd\u03c6\u2032\n0 (1 + \u03b2 cos \u03b8 )\nwhere the term sin \u03b8\u2032 derives from d\u03a9\u2032 = sin \u03b8\u2032 d\u03b8\u2032 d\u03c6\u2032\nIn the same way, if photons are unpolarized,\nunpol\n\nM\u20320 (\u03c6\u2032 ) =\n\nd\u03c3 \u2032\n\u221d\nd\u03c6\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n0\n\nsin2 \u03b8\u2032\n(1 + \u03b2 cos \u03b8\u2032 )\n\n4\n\nsin \u03b8\u2032 d\u03b8\u2032 \u221d 1.\n\n(3)\n\n\fIf the photons are incident orthogonally to the detector, the frames of reference x'y'z' and xyz are identical\n(see Fig. 2), and hence:\nM0 (\u03c6) \u2261 M\u20320 (\u03c6\u2032 ).\n(4)\nIn the hypothesis that the polarimeter has negligible systematic effects, the direction of the emission will\nbe reconstructed correctly with a probability, which in general depends on energy, identical in every direction.\nHence, the modulation M(\u03c6) measured by the detector is proportional to the intrinsic one (in the frame of\nreference of the detector), plus a constant which takes into account the errors in the process of measurement,\ni.e. the probability to reconstruct the direction of emission incorrectly:\n\u001a pol\nM0 (\u03c6) = cos2 \u03c6\nM(\u03c6) = M * M0 (\u03c6) + C with\n,\n(5)\nunpol\nM0 (\u03c6) = 1\nwhere M and C are constants. Eq. 5 is the canonic function employed to fit the modulation of the histogram of\nthe direction of photoelectrons with an X-ray polarimeter like the GPD.\nThe modulation factor \u03bc, namely the amplitude of the response of the instrument for completely polarized\nphotons, can be derived from Eq. 5:\n\u03bc=\n\nmax {M} \u2212 min {M}\nM\n=\n,\nmax {M} + min {M}\nM +2*C\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the last passage is allowed only if the M0 (\u03c6) function is normalized to unity.\n\n4. EXPECTED MODULATION FOR INCLINED PHOTONS\nIf the GPD is employed as narrow field instrument with an X-ray optics, the photons are incident nearly perpendicularly to the plane of detector, with an angle determinated by the focusing of the optics but always of the\norder of a few degrees. In this case, systematic effects are small and also reduced, even out of the optical axis,\nsince the azimuthal angles are different for each photon and hence different systematic effects sum incoherently\n(see Fig. 4(a)). Instead, for instruments with large field of view, photons coming from a source are all incident\nwith a large and identical inclination.\nHere we want to explore the systematic effects arising when the inclination angle \u03b4 is greater than a few\ndegrees, for polarized and unpolarized radiation. We limit ourself to the condition of inclination orthogonal to\nthe direction of polarization with the following assumptions:\n1. the direction of polarization is along the x axis;\n2. the inclination of an angle \u03b4 is performed around y axis (see Fig. 4(b)).\nThe function M0 (\u03c6) can be derived with the same procedure presented in Sec. 3, with the important difference\nthat, in this case, the references x'y'z' and xyz are not identical.

Note also that, when \u03b4 = 0\u25e6 , the\nfunctions are proportional to the functions reported in Eq. 5, obtained when photons are incident perpendicularly\nto the detector.\nThe function pol M0 (\u03c6, \u03b4, \u03b2) expresses the presence of a intrinsic constant term in the modulation curve for\ncompletely polarized and inclined photons, namely a costant contribution not due to the errors of measurement:\npol\n\nM0 (\u03c6 = 90\u25e6 , \u03b4, \u03b2) =\n\n2\nsin2 \u03b4 6= 0\n3\n\nif \u03b4 6= 0.\n\n(10)\n\nMoreover, when \u03b2 6= 0 and hence the relativistic correction is introduced, there is an asymmetry between the\ntwo peaks corresponding to the direction of polarization, which instead are identical when photons are orthogonal\nto the detector, deriving from the terms proportional to cos3 \u03c6 and cos \u03c6.\nInclined systematic effects can be visualized with the projection of the directions of emission of photoelectrons\nin the xy plane. While for orthogonal photons no photoelectrons tracks are projected in the y direction, namely\nin the direction orthogonal to the polarization (see Fig. 3), in case of inclined photons there is emission even in\nthis direction (see Fig. 5). Moreover, the emission on the left is more probable than that on the right (see again\nFig. 5) and this induces the asymmetry between the peaks of the modulation cuve.\n\n\fFigure 5. The same as Fig. 3, but for photons which are inclined of 30 degrees. Note that in this case there are tracks of\nphotoelectrons which are projected along the y axis, namely orthogonally to the direction of polarization. Note also the\ndifferent intensities of projections on the left and on the right, which indicate a different probability of emission.\n\nIn the case of unpolarized photons, a spurious modulation appears. In absence of the relativistic correction,\nthis contribution would be of the same form as a polarized signal:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n4\nunpol\n(11)\nM0 (\u03c6, \u03b4, \u03b2 = 0) = \u2212 sin2 \u03b4 cos2 \u03c6 + 2 \u2212 cos2 \u03b4 .\n3\n3\nHowever the presence of the relativistic correction introduces an asymmetry that allows, at least in principle,\nto distinguish it from the signal of polarized radiation.\n\n5. MEASUREMENT OF THE SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS FOR INCLINED\nRADIATION\nMuleri et al.11 presented a facility for the calibration of the next generation X-ray polarimeters, which allows to\nstudy the response of detectors to inclined, polarized and unpolarized radiation. We then employed this facility\nto measure the systematic effects presented in Sec. 4 (see Fig. 6).\nWe employed the 105k pixels, 50\u03bcm pitch, sealed version of the Gas Pixel Detector, described by Bellazzini\net al.,10 and filled with 30% helium and 70% DME mixture. Data were analyzed in the standard way, without\nany data selection in the shape of the tracks.\nIn Fig. 7 we report the modulation measured with the GPD in three different situations, fitted with the\nstandard cos2 function:\nM(\u03c6) = M * cos2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) + C.\n(12)\nIn particular, in Fig. 7(a) we show the response of the instrument to 3.7 keV polarized photons which are\nincident orthogonally to the detector. The fit is very good, as reported in Table 1, and a modulation factor\nof about 43% is obtained. Instead in Fig. 7(b) we report the modulation when the same kind of photons, i.e.\n3.7 keV polarized ones, are incident with an inclination of 40 degrees. In this case the fit is extremely poor, the\n\n\fFigure 6. The setup employed to perform the measurements at large angle of inclination. A complete description of the\nfacility used is presented by Muleri et al.11\n\npeaks are asymmetric and the modulation factor is by far lower, about 21%. These systematic effects were those\nexpected from the analysis performed in the Sec. 4, i.e. a reduction of the modulation due to a intrinsic constant\nterm and the asymmetry due to the relativistic correction. Eventually in Fig. 7(c) we report the response of\nthe instrument to unpolarized 5.9 keV obtained from a Fe55 radioactive source, inclined with respect to the\nperpendicular of the detector of 30 degrees. As expected, in this case a spurious and asymmetric modulation is\npresent and it mimics the effect of a polarized beam at the level of a few percent.\nAngular Distribution - iteration 1\n\nAngular Distribution - iteration 1\n\nAngular Distribution - iteration 1\n\n500\n\n400\n\n700\n\n350\n\n600\n\n300\n\n500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n200\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\nProb\n\n100\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n0.6229\n\nM\n\n275 \u00b1 4.9\n\nC\n\n179.7 \u00b1 2.5\n\nPhase\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n300\n\n92.06 / 97\n\n200\n100\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nPhi (rad)\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\n\n190.3 / 97\n\nProb\n\n4.929e-08\n\nM\n\n219.1 \u00b1 6.4\n\nC\n\n418.5 \u00b1 3.7\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\nM\nC\n\n100\n\nPhase\n\n50\n\n2\n\n3\nPhi (rad)\n\n0\n\n116.1 / 97\n\nProb\n\n150\n\nPhase -0.02049 \u00b1 0.01483\n\n-0.01535 \u00b1 0.00892\n\n0\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\n\n200\n\n400\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0.09012\n23.56 \u00b1 4.93\n288.7 \u00b1 3.0\n1.41 \u00b1 0.10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nPhi (rad)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7.

As in the case of Eq. 5, we fitted data with a function which is proportional to\nthe intrinsic modulation, plus a constant which takes into account the error in the process of measurement. We\n1\nto normalized to unity the function pol M0 (\u03c6, \u03b4, \u03b2) so\nintroduced the phase \u03c60 and the factor 4 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b4+\n\u03c0\u03b2\n|sin \u03b4|\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\nthat we can calculate the modulation factor with the usual formula \u03bc =\n\nM\nM+2*C .\n\nInstead, we employed:\nunpol\n\nM(\u03c6, \u03c60 , \u03b4 = \u03b4, \u03b2 = \u03b2) = M *\n\n\bunpol\n\nM0 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 , \u03b4, \u03b2) + C\n\n(14)\n\nfor fitting data for unpolarized radiation. Even in this case the shape of the modulation is fixed and only the\nnormalization can change.\nThe results of the fits are reported in Table 1. The agreement is quite good for all the measurements done.\nIn particular, taking into account the systematics, we can recover a good modulation factor even at 40 degrees,\nabout 33% against the 43% on axis. Instead the fit with the cos2 gives a modulation of about 21%, since it\ndoesn't take into account that there is a intrinsically unmodulated contribution.\nEventually we want also stress that the systematic effects presented are only visible in the unfolded modulation\ncurve, namely if the directions of photoelectrons are reconstructed on the whole round angle. Indeed, by assuming\nthat the modulation curve is periodic on 180 degrees, these systematics are confused and often not distinguishable\nfrom the actual signal.\nAngular Distribution - iteration 1\n\nAngular Distribution - iteration 1\n\nAngular Distribution - iteration 1\n\n500\n\n400\n\n700\n\n350\n\n600\n\n300\n\n500\n\n250\n\n300\n\n200\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\nProb\n\n100\n\nM\n\n275 \u00b1 4.9\n179.7 \u00b1 2.5\n\nPhase\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n200\n100\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nPhi (rad)\n\n0\n\n0.05416\n\nM\n\n334 \u00b1 9.5\n\nC\n\n338.5 \u00b1 5.6\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n100\n\n3\nPhi (rad)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n0.6711\n\nM\n\n78.61 \u00b1 11.26\n\nC\n\n196 \u00b1 15.0\n\nPhase -0.1118 \u00b1 0.0916\n\n50\n\n2\n\n90.32 / 97\n\nProb\n\n150\n\nPhase -0.02281 \u00b1 0.01444\n\n-0.01535 \u00b1 0.00892\n\n0\n\n120.4 / 97\n\nProb\n\n0.6229\n\nC\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\n\n300\n\n92.06 / 97\n\n\u03c72 / ndf\n\n200\n\n400\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nPhi (rad)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 8.

CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a feasibility study for testing the possible use of the Gas Pixel Detector as an X-ray photoelectric polarimeter with large field of view. Accurately analyzing the differential cross section of the photoelectric\n\n\fabsorption and performing measurements with polarized and unpolarized inclined photons, we have found that\nsystematic effects on the measured modulation exist for both polarized and unpolarized radiation when photons\nare not incident orthogonally to the detector. For polarized radiation, these systematics induce an intrinsic\nunmodulated contribution and an asymmetry between the peaks of the modulation curve corresponding to the\ndirection of polarization. While the former effect arises from the inclination of the photons and tends to reduce\nthe modulation factor, the latter is due to the relativistic correction of the differential photoelectric cross section\nwhich can only be distinguished in the unfolded modulation curve. Instead the systematics in the case of unpolarized radiation mimic the modulation induced by polarized photons and only a relativistic asymmetry, again\nvisible only in the unfolded modulation curve, can, in principle, disentangle the two situations.\nAfter discussing the systematics arising when polarized or unpolarized inclined beams are incident on the\ndetector, we have also presented functions to fit the modulation curves and correct the systematic effects. We have\nonly restricted the analysis in one of the simplest situation, assuming that the direction of polarization is parallel\nto the axis of inclination. Even if we can't today establish the feasibility of photoelectric polarmeter with large\nfield of view, good results are obtained by assuming that the inclination and the velocity of the photoelectrons are\nknown. This corresponds to assume that the instrument has both good imaging and spectroscopic capabilities,\nthat is the case of the GPD.\n\nAcknowledgments\nFM acknowledges financial support from Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) under contract ASI I/088/06/0.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Meszaros, P., Novick, R., Szentgyorgyi, A., Chanan, G.
