This type of transition depends to first order\nonly on the vector part of the weak interaction. The corrected\nF t value, determined from the experimental comparative lifetime, ft, is:\n\nF t = f t \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u03b4C + \u03b4N S ) \u00d7 (1 +\nK\n= 2\ngV \u00d7 hMF i2 \u00d7 (1 + \u2206R )\n\n\u2032\n\u03b4R\n)\n\n(1)\n\nand directly related to the vector\n\u221a coupling constant, g V . The\nmatrix element, hMF i, equals 2 for T=1 nuclei, ft is determined from the mass difference between the initial and final\nanalogue states, QEC , the half-life of the parent nucleus, T1/2 ,\nand the branching ratio (BR) for the super-allowed decay, while\n\u2032\n\u03b4C , \u03b4N S , \u03b4R\nand \u2206R are correction factors that must be determined by models [2,3]. K is a constant.\nFrom the corrected F t value, one can determine the vector\ncoupling constant, g V , and test the validity of the Conserved\na\nPresent address: TRIUMF, 4004 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver,\nBritish Columbia, V6T 2A3, Canada\nb\nPresent address: Instituut voor Kern- en Stralingsfysica, Celestijnenlaan 200D, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium\n\nVector Current (CVC) hypothesis of the weak interaction stating that the vector part of the weak interaction is not influenced\nby the strong interaction. Furthermore, the g V value combined\nwith the weak vector coupling constant for the purely leptonic\n\u03bc-decay, g \u03bcV , yields the up-quark down-quark element Vud of\nthe Cabibbo - Kobayashi - Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix:\n2\nVud\n=\n\ngV2\n2\ngV\u03bc\n\n=\n\nK\n2\n2gV\u03bc (1\n\n+ \u2206R )F t\n\n(2)\n\nPresently, this is the key ingredient in one of the most demanding tests of the unitarity of the CKM matrix that assures\nthe validity of the three-generation Standard Model.\nA recent review of super-allowed Fermi transitions reported\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nsuch measurements in 20 nuclei with ( T ;Tz ) = ( 1 ;\u22121, 0) [1].\nTwelve nuclei have a precision close to or better than 10\u22123 for\nthe experimental ingredients needed and were used to determine F t with a precision close to 10\u22124 . The reported average\nvalue is 3072.7\u00b10.8 s [1]. This yields a Vud value of 0.9738(4).\nThe nuclear \u03b2 decay provides the most precise determination\nof the up-quark down-quark element of the CKM matrix. We\nremind that Vud can also be determined from the neutron decay\nneutron\n\u03c0\u00b1\n(Vud\n= 0.9746(18)) and from the pion beta decay (Vud\n=\n0.9749(26)) [4].\nSince the 2005 review of Hardy and Towner, the 62 Ga superallowed decay reached the required precision in order to increase to thirteen the number of transitions used to determine\nF t and its present adopted value is 3071.4(8) s, leading to a\nvalue of 0.97418(26) for the Vud matrix element. These values\n\n\f2\n\nI. Matea et al.: Precise half-life measurement of the 26 Si ground state\n\nincorporate also the most recent calculation for the correction\nfactors [3].\nWhat gives credit to the nuclear result for the gV value is\nthe fact that a significant number of super-allowed transitions\nmeasured with high precision gives consistent results for F t.\nAn important work is in progress in order to add to the above\nmentioned 13 nuclei some of the other seven cited in [1]. None\nof these seven nuclei has a precise measurement of the superallowed BR due to the presence of Gamow-Teller transitions in\ncompetition with the super-allowed one. Concerning the halflife values, they are known with a relative precision worse than\n2*10\u22123 .\nWe report in this paper on half-life and BR measurements\nfor the decay of the 26 Si (Tz = \u22121) nucleus. The aim of the\nexperiment was to reach a precision of 10\u22123 for the measured\nhalf-life.\nPrevious measurements of the 26 Si half-life reported an average value of 2.234(12) s [5,6]. The BR and the QEC of the\nsuper-allowed decay are, respectively, 75.09(92) % and\n4836.9(30) keV [1]. The precision of the measured quantities\nis not sufficient to add the decay of 26 Si to the thirteen superallowed transitions testing the electroweak Standard Model.\n\n2 Experimental procedure\nThe experiment was performed at the Accelerator Laboratory\nof the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. We used the IGISOL technique\nwith the JYFLTRAP facility to separate pure samples of 26 Si.\n2.1 Production and separation\nThe ions were produced in light-ion induced fusion-evaporation\nreactions with a continuous 35 MeV proton beam having an\naverage intensity of 45 \u03bcA on a 2.3 mg/cm2 -thick nat Al target. After being slowed down and thermalized in the gas cell\nof the ion-guide [7], the different recoil ions were accelerated\nto 30 keV. They were submitted to a mass separation in a 55\u25e6\ndipole magnet having a resolving power of 500, and the A=26\nions were injected into a buffer-gas filled RF-quadrupole for\ncooling and bunching before injection into the first Penning\ntrap of the JYFLTRAP tandem trap system [8,9] for isobaric\nseparation [10]. The mass resolving power of the first trap was\nabout 50,000 for this experiment and the cyclotron frequency\nset to select 26 Si ions was 4134247 Hz.\nThe measurements were structured in cycles. A master cycle started with a 500 ms accumulation time in the RFQ followed by eight trap cycles and a decay measurement period.\nOne trap cycle (0.231 s) was structured as follows: 100 ms\n(cooling) + 10 ms (dipole excitation) + 120 ms (mass selective quadrupole excitation). The ions were then ejected from\nthe first trap, reflected by the second and recaptured again in\nthe first one for the next trap cycle. As a consequence, the contaminants were removed because they could not pass the 2 mm\ndiaphragm between the two traps and only 26 Si returned to the\nfirst trap. This multiple injection method was favored in order to overcome the space charge limit of the purification trap.\nIn parallel with one trap cycle, ions were cumulated into the\nRFQ for the next one. In the master cycle, the eighth trap cycle\n\nwas followed by a final cleaning (0.231 s) of the accumulated\nbunches and by a 24.4 s decay measurement. The decay window was triggered by the trap extraction signal and during the\ndecay measurement, the cyclotron beam was turned off in order\nto avoid any background in the experimental setup due to reactions on the target. Data were effectively taken over a period\nof 68 hours and we have accumulated a total of 3.559(2) * 106\n26\nSi ions.\n2.2 Experimental setup\nPurified samples of 26 Si were implanted on a 0.5 inch wide\nmovable tape placed at the end of the extraction beam line.\nThe implantation spot was surrounded by an almost 4\u03c0 cylindrical plastic scintillator, 2 mm thick with a 12 mm entrance\nhole, used to detect the positrons emitted in the \u03b2 + decay.\nThe scintillation light was collected by two 2-inch photomultiplier tubes through a special light guide. The two photomultipliers were used in coincidence in order to remove most of\nthe individual noise. The \u03b2 + -particle detection efficiency was\nabout 90 % [11]. Three 60% coaxial germanium detectors were\nplaced around the plastic scintillator in the horizontal plane at\n\u221290\u25e6 (Ge1), 0\u25e6 (Ge3) and 90\u25e6 (Ge2) angles with respect to\nthe extraction beam line in order to provide \u03b2\u2212\u03b3 coincidence\ndata. The detector labeled Ge3 was placed at 122.4 mm from\nthe implantation point, whilst the other two were placed closer,\nat 29.3 mm (Ge1) and 30.4 mm (Ge2). The germanium crystals\nwere surrounded by low-radioactivity lead bricks that reduced\nthe \u03b3 background by a factor of 4. The aim of the \u03b3 detection\nwas to measure the super-allowed BR and to monitor the background.\nFor the data taking we have used two independent data acquisition (DAQ) systems. The trigger for both DAQ systems\nwas the coincident \u03b2 signal from the two photomultipliers and\nit was allowed only during the decay measurement time window of the master cycle. The first system, simple but fast, DAQ A,\nwas running in a cycle-by-cycle mode and had two predefined\ndead times \u2212 2 and 8 \u03bcs. The corresponding data will be referred to as Data1 and Data2. The time precision of this DAQ\nwas determined by the clock of the PC on which it runs and\nit was far below 1 \u03bcs. The second system, DAQ B, providing\nevent-by-event data, had a predefined dead time of 100 \u03bcs and\nthe corresponding data will be referred to as Data3. For the\ntime stamp we used a 16-channel VME scaler that registered\nsignals from a 1-MHz high precision clock generator. For both\nDAQ systems, the dead times were chosen to be longer that any\npossible event treatment by the electronics or data processing.\nThe dead-time window was generated with a module having a\nprecision better than 10 ns. DAQ A registered only the time difference between the trap extraction signal and the subsequent\nevent triggers. With the DAQ B we could register also the energy signals from the germanium detectors in coincidence with\nthe trigger signal.\n2.3 Search for 26 Alm contamination\nAs mentioned above, the Penning traps were used to provide\na pure sample of 26 Si on the tape for the life-time measurements. A possible contaminant was 26 Alm having a half-life\n\n\fI. Matea et al.: Precise half-life measurement of the 26 Si ground state\n\nonly three times longer than the one of 26 Si. The contamination\nwith 26 Alm could come either from the reaction itself (26 Alm\nproduced and selected together with 26 Si), or from the decay of\n26\nSi during the selection and transport to the detection system.\n\n3\n\ntation frequency to a value between the cyclotron frequencies\nfor the selection of the two isobars. Using the same sequencing\nin the master cycle as for the half-life measurement, we have\nobtained the decay time spectrum presented in figure 1b). The\nnormalized \u03c72 indicated in fig. 1b) is obtained for a fit with\na constant function. Using a degree-one polynomial for the fit\ngives a slope that is compatible with zero in the error bars.\n\nFig. 2. Time spectrum for the test of side implantation. We present\nonly the data points accumulated after the tape was moved (see text\nfor more details). The decaying component comes from the 26 Si ions\nimplanted on the entrance window of the plastic scintillator which are\nnot removed with the tape move.\n\nFig. 1. a) Isobaric scan around 26 Si and 26 Alm : circles \u2212 20 Hz scan\nand squares \u2212 background scan. The background was measured by\ninserting a beam stopper in the line. b) Decay spectrum when the excitation frequency is set between 26 Si and 26 Alm , as indicated in part\na) of the figure.\n\nWe have performed several tests in order to verify the purity of the samples. For the first test, the centering cyclotron\nfrequency was switched off during the eighth cycle. Without\ncentering, no ion is supposed to survive the extraction from\nthe first trap after the last dipole magnetron excitation. This\nway, we could check that the magnetron excitation was strong\nenough to push all ions to radii bigger than 1 mm (the radius\nof the extraction hole) in the last trap cycle when we have the\nbiggest ion cloud in the trap. The corresponding time spectrum\naccumulated during the decay time window is constant with a\nnormalized \u03c72 of 1.\nAnother possible source of contamination with 26 Alm could\nbe an insufficient resolving power of the trap system. The 20 Hz\nstep frequency scan presented in figure 1a) was done in order to\nhave a rough estimate of such a possible overlap. Then, in order\nto check the background measurement, we have fixed the exci-\n\nA final test to check for the initial conditions as far as the\nimplanted sample was concerned was to verify that we implanted the ions entirely on the tape. To do so, we have changed\nonly the decay measurement cycle as follows: after the extraction signal sent by the trap, we have measured the deposited\nactivity for 1.3 s, moved the tape and continued to measure the\nactivity until the end of the 24.4 s decay measurement window. If any activity was implanted somewhere else than on the\ntape, like e.g. on the entrance window of the scintillator, the\nsecond part of the decay spectrum should still see the decay\nof 26 Si and, subsequently, of 26 Alm . The resulting spectrum is\npresented in fig. 2 and one can easily see that such was the case.\nFrom this measurement we have deduced that 2.97(14)% of the\nextracted 26 Si was not implanted on the tape. This means that\nat the end of a master cycle, when the tape was moved, there\nwas a remaining activity of 26 Alm that had to be taken into account for the next cycle in the fitting function. As an example,\nfor the highest counting rate per cycle during the experiment\n(about 550 implanted 26 Si ions/cycle), one can estimate that a\nmaximum of 2 atoms of 26 Alm originating from the side implantation of the previous cycle were present at the beginning\nof the next cycle. We can also safely suppose that there is no\n26\nSi left from one master cycle to the next. After this measurement, we added in the beam line a 50 mm thick collimator with\na 10 mm diameter close to the scintillator entrance window in\norder to avoid the side implantation. The fit used for the runs\nafter this change did not include anymore the influence of the\nside implantation.\nAs a further check for the absence of contaminants, we have\nanalyzed the gamma-ray spectra registered in coincidence with\n\n\f4\n\nI. Matea et al.: Precise half-life measurement of the 26 Si ground state\n\nFig. 3. Gamma spectrum in coincidence with a \u03b2 ray detected by the\nplastic scintillator. The X-rays are coming from the low-radioactivity\nlead bricks used to reduce the \u03b3 background.\n\nthe activity implanted on the tape. This allowed us to verify\nif there was any other \u03b3-ray emitting contaminant in the implanted sample. The spectrum is presented in figure 3. The only\n\u03b3-rays that are present come either from \u03b3 or positron scattering in the lead bricks surrounding the germanium detectors,\nfrom the positron-electron annihilation, or from the \u03b2 decay of\n26\nSi.\n\n3 Half-life results\nIn this section, we will first discuss in detail the results from\nthe three different data sets and the analysis procedure yielding\nthe final half-life value with its statistical error. We will also\ndiscuss the influence of different parameters on this final result.\n3.1 Analysis procedure\nThe fitting procedure can be found in more detail in [12]. The\nfirst step of the analysis was a decay cycle selection. We have\nselected all the cycles having a number of counts larger than 10.\nThere were no significant changes in the life-time value when\nthe minimum number of counts per cycle was varied up to 200.\nThe accepted cycles were then corrected for the dead-time.\nThe next step was a cycle-by-cycle fit. The function used\nfor the fit was defined to take into account the decay of 26 Si and\nof its daughter, 26 Alm . Five parameters were used: the number\nof 26 Si at the beginning of the decay cycle (NSi\n0 ), the half-life of\n26\nSi (TSi\n),\na\nconstant\nbackground,\nthe\nhalf-life\nof 26 Alm (TAl\n1/2\n1/2\n= 6.3450(19) s [1]) and the correction factor that takes into\naccount the side implanted 26 Si ions. The last two parameters\nwere fixed.\nDuring the fit, we imposed the condition that the normalized \u03c72 has to be two or better in order to accept the cycle. This\nprocedure rejects, e.g., cycles where problems with the HV of\nthe RFQ occurred. Increasing the limit from 2 to 2000 for \u03c72\nleaves the life-time unchanged. We have also excluded the first\nchannel from the fit, corresponding to the first 15 ms of the\n\nFig. 4. The time distribution obtained for a single run (full circles).\nThe full line is the result of the fit and the contributions from 26 Si,\n26\nAlm and the background are represented separately. A half-life of\n2.229(11) s was obtained for this run.\n\ndecay cycle that includes the period when we could still have\nincoming ions from the trap. This decision was supported by\nthe fact that the results including the first channel were quite\ndifferent (up to 0.7%) from the ones excluding it. We varied\nthe number of excluded channels at the beginning of the time\nspectra from 2 to 30 but with no significant change (less than\n0.04%) appearing in the resultant life-time.\nAll in all, about 2 to 3% of the cycles were rejected because the fit did not converge or the \u03c72 was higher than 2. The\naccepted cycles were further grouped into runs and the cumulated decay spectra were fitted again run-by-run with the same\nprocedure. One run contained between several to 400 cycles.\nFigure 4 shows the experimental decay-time spectrum decomposed into its different contributions from the decay of 26 Si,\n26 m\nAl , and of the background for one run.\nThe fit results of the three data sets and the associated normalized \u03c72 as a function of the run number are presented in\nfigure 5, left and center. The important scattering and the associated error bars for the half-life values from run 39 to 93\nare due to a low production/selection efficiency for 26 Si. We\nobtain a mean half-life of 2.2282(25) s for Data1, 2.2282(25) s\nfor Data2 and 2.2286(24) s for Data3. The resulting experimental half-life for the 26 Si ground state is 2.2283(25) s. This value\nis the weighted mean of the three data sets and the statistical\nerror is chosen to be the biggest one since the data sets are not\nindependent measurements.\nIn parallel, for each selected cycle, we have generated simulated data for which all characteristics except the half-life were\ndetermined by the fit of the corresponding experimental cycle.\nWe used a half-life of 2.228 s for the generation of the simulated spectra. The simulated data were then analyzed with the\nsame procedure as the experimental data. The results obtained\nfor the simulated data are summarized on the right side of figure 5.\n\n\fI.

Center: The normalized \u03c72 obtained from the fit of experimental data as a function of run number for the\nthree data sets. Right: Half-life results from the simulated data as a function of run number for the three data sets. For the simulations, we have\nused a half-life value of 2.228 s for 26 Si and the three data-sets were independently generated.\n\n3.2 Error budget\n\n3.2.2 Experimental conditions and systematic errors\n\nThe experimental half-life value cited above includes only the\nstatistical error obtained from the fit of time spectra of the 3\ndata sets. In the following, we shall discuss other sources of\nerrors for the measured value like, e.g., fixed parameters in the\nfit function, systematic errors due to experimental conditions,\netc.\n\nDuring the experiment we have made several modifications to\nthe electronics setup in order to check for systematic errors.\n\n3.2.1 Systematic errors associated with the fitting\nprocedure\nAs previously mentioned, we used a five parameter function\nto fit the experimental spectra. Two of these parameters were\nfixed: the life-time of 26 Alm and the percentage of side implanted 26 Si. In order to take into account the errors on these\nparameters, we have included them in the final result for the\nhalf-life of 26 Si by changing the fixed parameter values within\none sigma. This gives an error of 0.3 ms that will be referred to\nas the systematic error due to fixed parameters (SEFP).\nAlso, the half-life results from the three different data sets\nare slightly different from each other. To take this effect into\naccount, we have calculated the sum of squared differences between each value and the central mean value. This gives a systematical error of 0.2 ms to which we shall refer to as the error\ndue to dead-time corrections (SDT).\n\nTable 1. Error budget for the 26 Si life-time measurement. SHV-CFD\nis the error due to detector bias and threshold of constant fraction discriminators, SEFP is the error due to fixed parameters in the fit and\nSDT is due to dead-time corrections. The individual values are added\nquadratically to calculate the final error on the half-life of 26 Si.\nSource\nStatistical error\nSHV-CFD\nSEFP\nSDT\nFinal error\n\nUncertainty (ms)\n2.5\n1.0\n0.3\n0.2\n2.7\n\nThe HV of the photomultipliers was changed during the experiment from -1.73 kV to -1.92 kV along with the thresholds\nof the constant fraction modules used to trigger the photomultiplier signals. The two photomultipliers were always biased\nat the same value using one HV module (Ortec HV-556) with\n\n\f6\n\nI. Matea et al.: Precise half-life measurement of the 26 Si ground state\n\ntwo identical outputs. The experimental data presented in figure 5 can be structured in three main groups with respect to the\nHV and constant fraction threshold values: runs 39-93, runs\n96-99 and runs 103-119. Results from the fits of either group\nare consistent with each other at one sigma. Nevertheless, they\nintroduce a systematical error (referred to as SHV-CFD) calculated as the sum of squared differences between each value and\nthe half-life mean value weighted by the respective errors that\ngives a systematical error of 1 ms.\nIn table 1 we quote the contributions from different sources\nto the final error on the experimental half-life value.\n\n3.3 Final experimental result for the half-life\nThe final result for the half-life of the 26 Si ground state is\n2.2283(27) s. Previous measurements of the ground state halflife were reported by Hardy [5] (2.210(21) s) and Wilson [6]\n(2.240(10) s). In figure 6, one can see that the agreement is\nvery good between these values and our measurement.\n\nspectra of the three germanium detectors and we will present\nin the following the procedure we used to determine the BR.\nThe total photopeak \u03b3 efficiency (\u03b5T ) of the germanium\nsetup was measured using standard calibration sources of 134 Cs,\n137\nCs, 60 Co, 133 Ba and 228 Th. The 60 Co source had an activity\nknown with a precision better than 0.1%. The first step in the\nanalysis was the direct determination of the efficiency curve\nfrom the source measurements. This efficiency curve had then\nto be corrected for \u03b2-\u03b3 or \u03b3-\u03b3 summing effects. These corrections can be derived from simulations and one has to take\ninto account as exhaustively as possible all the mechanisms\nby which a \u03b2 or a \u03b3-ray can produce charges in the germanium crystals. For example, in the case of 137 Cs, the correction\nshould be close to 1 as there is only one \u03b3-ray and no \u03b2-\u03b3 summation (Q\u03b2 \u2212 being too low to have electrons with a kinetic\nenergy high enough to arrive in the germanium crystals).\nWe have used the GEANT4 package [13] to calculate the\ncorrection factors for the efficiency curve. The experimental\nsetup defined in the simulations included the vacuum chamber,\nthe lead used to screen the germanium detectors from the background radioactivity and the germanium detectors. The calibration sources were defined as being point-like since there is no\nsignificant change in the correction factors if one uses finite\nsize sources and we took into account their complete decay\nscheme. We have started with the simulation of single \u03b3-rays\n(thus, no summing effects) generated from the source position\nand counted the number of events in the photopeak (N\u03b3single ).\nThe next step was the simulation of the complete decay scheme\nof each source so that the \u03b2-\u03b3 or \u03b3-\u03b3 summing effects could be\ntaken into account. Then, the number of events in each photopeak divided by N\u03b3single for the same energy was the correction\nfactor used to obtain the corrected experimental single gamma\nefficiency curve.\nTable 2. Correction factors obtained from simulations for individual\n\u03b3 rays of calibration sources for each germanium detector.\nSource\n\n26\n\nFig. 6. Comparison of the present measurement of the Si half-life\nwith previous measurements reported in the literature. The full line\nindicates the weighted mean of all the existing measurements; the\ndashed lines indicate the error on the mean value.\n\n4 Branching ratio for the 0+ \u2192 0+ transition\nAs previously mentioned, the BR for the super-allowed decay\nwas already measured with a precision of about 1% [1]. It was\nobtained by measuring the absolute non-analogue \u03b2 + branching for the most intense \u03b3 transition (829 keV de-exciting the\nEx =1058 keV energy level in 26 Al) and the relative intensities\nof the other \u03b3 transitions relative to the 829 keV transition. This\naccuracy is not enough if we want to know the F t value for 26 Si\nwith a precision of several 10\u22124 .\nThe main purpose of the present experiment being the halflife measurement, we were not aiming to achieve the required\nprecision on the BR.

The results are represented in figure 7. One can easily see\nthat there is a systematical difference between the experiment\nand the calculations of about 20%. This can come from a lack\nof knowledge about the materials surrounding the implantation\n\n\fI. Matea et al.: Precise half-life measurement of the 26 Si ground state\n\n7\n\nTable 3.

The results\nare presented in table 3 and compared with the adopted values\nin [1]. We deduce then an absolute \u03b2-decay branch for nonanalogue transitions of 24.31(232)% resulting in a absolute \u03b2decay branch for the super-allowed transition of 75.69(232)%.\nFor the transitions that were not observed in our experiment we\nhave used the relative intensities from [1].\n\n5 Conclusions\nWe have performed a high-precision measurement of the halflife of 26 Si. The half-life was determined by detecting the \u03b2\nparticles from the decay of a 26 Si source produced and separated at the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4\nusing the IGISOL technique with the JYFLTRAP facility. The\nresult of T1/2 = 2.2283(27) s obtained in this work is in agreement with older half-life values from the literature. The present\nFig. 7.
