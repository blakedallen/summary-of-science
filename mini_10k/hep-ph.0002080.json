I sketch some pressing questions in several active areas of particle physics\nand outline the challenges they present for the design and operation of detectors.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMy assignment at the 1999 ICFA Instrumentation School is to survey some current developments in particle physics, and to describe the kinds of experiments we\nwould like to do in the near future and illustrate the demands our desires place\non detectors and data analysis. Like any active science, particle physics is in a\nstate of continual renewal. Many of the subjects that seem most fascinating and\nmost promising today simply did not exist as recently as twenty-five years ago.\nOther topics that have preoccupied physicists for many years have been reshaped\nby recent discoveries and insights, and transformed by new techniques in accelerator science and detector technology. To provide some context for the courses and\nlaboratories at this school, I have chosen three topics that are of high scientific\ninterest, and that place very different demands on instrumental techniques. I hope\nthat you will begin to see the breadth of opportunities in particle physics, and that\nyou will also look beyond the domain of particle physics for opportunities to apply\nthe lessons you learn here in Istanbul.\nI begin with the remarkable neutrino, a subatomic particle that our instruments\nmust be able to detect both by its presence and by its absence, depending on the\ncircumstances. In particular, I note the interest in observing and characterizing\nneutrino oscillations in order to determine the properties of the neutrinos, and\ndescribe some of the new instruments contemplated to do that. Then I will talk\nabout physics at the high-energy frontier, focusing on what we hope to learn from\n1)\n\nReview lecture given at the ICFA Instrumentation School, Istanbul, Turkey, June 30, 1999.\nInternet address: quigg@fnal.gov.\n3)\nFermilab is operated by Universities Research Association Inc. under Contract No. DE-AC0276CH03000 with the United States Department of Energy.\nFERMILAB\u2013Conf\u201300/041\u2013T\n2)\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n2\n\nthe top quark in the next set of experiments at Fermilab's Tevatron Collider. Third,\nI will tell you some of the ways we hope to explore the landscape of spacetime,\nand explore some of the signs we might find that the three-plus-one dimensions of\nordinary experience are not the whole story. My treatment of all of these will be\nschematic; in a single lecture, my intent is to raise questions and present a wide\nrange of challenges and opportunities.\n\nNEUTRINO PUZZLES\nNeutrinos are tiny subatomic particles that carry no electric charge, have (almost)\nno mass, move (nearly) at the speed of light, and hardly interact at all. They are\namong the most abundant particles in the Universe. As you listen to this lecture,\ninside your body are more than 10 million (107 ) relic neutrinos left over from the\nBig Bang. Each second, some 1014 neutrinos made in the Sun pass through you. In\none tick of the clock, about a thousand neutrinos made by cosmic-ray interactions\nin Earth's atmosphere traverse your body. Other neutrinos reach us from natural\nsources, including radioactive decays of elements inside the Earth, and artificial\nsources, such as nuclear reactors.\nOur awareness of neutrinos started with a puzzle in 1914 that led to an idea in\n1930 that was confirmed by an experiment in 1956. Today, neutrinos have become\nan important tool for particle physics and astrophysics, and fascinating objects of\nstudy that may yield important new clues about the basic laws of Nature.\n\nThe First Neutrino Puzzle\nThere was a neutrino puzzle even before physicists knew there was a neutrino.\nNatural and artificial radioactivity includes nuclear beta (\u03b2) decay, observed as\nA\n\nZ\u2192\n\nA\n\n(Z + 1) + \u03b2 \u2212 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2212 is the old-fashioned name for an electron and A Z stands for the nucleus\nwith Z protons and A \u2212 Z neutrons. Examples are tritium \u03b2 decay,\n3\n\nH1 \u2192\n\n3\n\nHe2 + \u03b2 \u2212 ,\n\n(2)\n\nneutron \u03b2 decay,\nn \u2192 p + \u03b2\u2212 ,\n\n(3)\n\n214\n\n(4)\n\nand \u03b2 decay of Lead-214,\n214\n\nPb82 \u2192\n\nBi83 + \u03b2 \u2212 .\n\nFor two-body decays, the Principle of Conservation of Energy & Momentum says\nthat the \u03b2 particle, or electron, should have a definite energy, indicated by the\n\n\fNumber of events\n\nFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n3\n\nExpected\nObserved\n\nBeta particle energy\nFIGURE 1. Expectations and reality for the beta decay spectrum.\n\nspike in Figure 1. What was observed was very different: in 1914, James Chadwick\n(later to discover the neutron) showed conclusively [1] that in the decay of Radium\nB and C (214 Pb and 214 Bi), the \u03b2 energy follows a continuous spectrum, as shown\nin Figure 1.\nHow could we account for this completely unexpected behavior? Might it mean\nthat energy and momentum are not uniformly conserved in subatomic events?4\nAlthough Chadwick did not discover the neutron until 1932, we can use a little\nchronological license to sharpen our puzzle by considering a cartoon of neutron \u03b2\ndecay. The continuous \u03b2 spectrum means that, in general, the products of the decay\nof a stationary neutron will not have balanced momenta (zero net momentum), as\nshown in the left-hand frame in Figure 2. For the products of a system at rest to\ndrift off in some direction flies in the face of physical intuition, though we have\nto concede that at the time, physicists' intuition was still largely derived from\nmacroscopic experience.\n4)\n\nNiels Bohr was willing to consider this possibility.\n\nproton\nn\n\nproton\nn\n\nelectron\n\nelectron's antineutrino\n\nelectron\n\nFIGURE 2. (Left) Apparent nonconservation of energy and momentum in neutron beta decay;\n(Right) Pauli's solution to the nonconservation of energy and momentum: a nearly massless,\nneutral, penetrating particle that we know as \u03bd\u0304e .\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n4\n\nThe Neutrino Conjectured and Observed\nThe \u03b2-decay energy crisis tormented physicists for years. On December 4, 1930,\nWolfgang Pauli addressed an open letter5 to a meeting on radioactivity in T\u00fcbingen.\nPauli could not attend in person because his presence at a student ball in Zurich\nwas \"indispensable.\" In his letter, Pauli advanced the outlandish idea of a new,\nvery penetrating, neutral particle of vanishingly small mass. Because Pauli's new\nparticle interacted very feebly with matter, it would escape undetected from any\nknown apparatus, taking with it some energy, which would seemingly be lost. The\nbalance of energy and momentum would be restored, as shown in the right-hand\nframe of Figure 2, by the particle we now know as the electron's antineutrino. The\nproper decay scheme for the neutron is thus\nn \u2192 p + \u03b2 \u2212 + \u03bd\u0304 .\n\n(5)\n\nPauli's new particle was indeed a \"desperate remedy,\" but it was, in its way, very\nconservative, for it preserved the principle of energy and momentum conservation\nand with it the notion that the laws of physics are invariant under translations in\nspace and time. The hypothesis fit the facts; after the discovery of the neutron in\n1932, Fermi named the new particle the neutrino, to distinguish it from the neutron,\nand constructed his four-fermion theory of the weak interaction. Experimental\nconfirmation of Pauli's neutrino had to wait for dramatic advances in technology.\nDetecting a particle as penetrating as the neutrino required a large target and\na copious source of neutrinos. In 1953, Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines [4] used the\nintense beam of antineutrinos from a fission reactor\nA\n\nZ\u2192\n\nA\n\n(Z + 1) + \u03b2 \u2212 + \u03bd\u0304 ,\n\n(6)\n\nand a heavy target (10.7 ft3 of liquid scintillator) containing about 1028 protons to\ndetect the reaction\n\u03bd\u0304 + p \u2192 e+ + n .\n\n(7)\n\nInitial runs at the Hanford Engineering Works were suggestive but inconclusive.\nMoving their apparatus to the stronger fission neutrino source at the Savannah\nRiver nuclear plant, Cowan and Reines and their team made the definitive observation of inverse \u03b2 decay in 1956 [5].\n5)\n\nPauli's letter (in the original German) is reproduced in Ref. [2]. For an English translation,\nsee pp. 127-8 of Ref. [3]. It begins, \"Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen, I have hit upon a\ndesperate remedy regarding . . . the continuous \u03b2-spectrum . . . \" Pauli concluded, \"For the moment\nI dare not publish anything about this idea and address myself confidentially first to you. . . . I\nadmit that my way out may seem rather improbable a priori . . . . Nevertheless, if you don't play\nyou can't win . . . . Therefore, Dear Radioactives, test and judge.\" Pauli's neutrino, together with\nthe discovery of the neutron, also resolved a vexing nuclear spin-and-statistics problem.\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n5\n\nThree Families of Leptons\nIn addition to the electron (e) and its neutrino (\u03bde ), we now recognize two other\npairs of pointlike, spin- 12 particles that are not affected by the strong interaction:\n\u03bde\ne\u2212\n\n!\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\u03bc\u2212\n\nL\n\n!\n\nL\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\u03c4\u2212\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nL\n\nThese particles are known as leptons, from the Greek \u03bb\u01eb\u03c0\u03c4 \u00f3\u03c2 = thin, inspired by\nthe small mass of the electron, muon, and their neutrinos compared with the mass\nof the proton and neutron, the lightest of the baryons (from the Greek \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 =\nheavy).6\nThe muon neutrino is created in charged pion decay,\n\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc\n\nand \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ,\n\n(9)\n\nand neutrino beams produced at accelerators are overwhelmingly muon neutrinos.\nThe two-neutrino experiment carried out at Brookhaven National Lab in the early\n1960s [6] demonstrated that the neutrinos produced in pion decays do not initiate\ninverse \u03b2 decay, so that \u03bd\u03bc is distinct from \u03bde .\nThe donut (direct observation of nu-tau) Experiment [7] under analysis at\nFermilab is a three-neutrino experiment. Using a prompt neutrino beam in which\ndecays of the charmed-strange meson\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4\n|\n\u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 + anything\n\n(10)\n\nprovide the \u03bd\u03c4 source, the experimenters aim to observe the reaction\n\u03bd\u03c4 N \u2192 \u03c4 + anything.\n\n(11)\n\nI expect to see results from donut in the year 2000.\n\nNeutrino Beams and Detectors\nNeutrinos traverse vast amounts of material. The fission antineutrinos detected\nby Cowan, Reines, and their collaborators have an inverse \u03b2-decay cross section\n\u03c3(\u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 e+ n) \u2248 10\u221243 cm2 . Accordingly, their interaction length,\nLint =\n6)\n\n1\n\u03c3(\u03bd\u0304e p \u2192\n\ne+ n)NA (Z/A)\u03c1\u0304\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nWe would not choose the same names today, knowing that the tau lepton is twice as massive\nas the proton . . .\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n6\n\nSolar diameter\n\nEarth diameter\nLunar diameter\n\nFIGURE 3. Interaction lengths for neutrino interactions on an isoscalar nucleon target (from\nRef. [8]).\n\nwhere NA = 6.022 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22123 is Avogadro's number, \u03c1\u0304 is the specific gravity of\nthe target, and Z/A is the proton fraction of the target nucleons, is very long. It\ncorresponds to about 1.7 \u00d7 1019 cm of water, or a column density of 1.7 \u00d7 1010\nkilotonnes per square centimeter. On average, a fission neutrino would traverse\nmore than four light-years of lead-the distance from Earth to \u03b1-Centauri-before\ninteracting. At higher energies, the cross section for the inclusive reaction \u03bd\u0304e p \u2192\ne+ + anything grows-at first \u221d E\u03bd , then more slowly-so the interaction length\ndecreases. The high-energy dependence of the \u03bdN interaction length is shown in\nFigure 3. The interaction length of a 100-GeV neutrino is approximately 25 million\nkilometers of water, or about 230 Earth diameters. If you should stand in Fermilab's\nneutrino beam, only one neutrino in 1011 will interact in your body.\nWhat are the consequences of the great interaction length? First, there is the\nmissing-energy signature for neutrinos. Second, there is the difficulty of detecting\nneutrino interactions. Third-because the other known particles all interact more\nthan neutrinos do-we have the possibility of preparing filtered neutrino beams,\nwhich we shall discuss in a moment. Fourth, because neutrinos can penetrate great\ncolumns of matter, whereas electromagnetic radiation is blocked by a few hundred\ngrams of material, it is appealing to consider the promise of neutrino astronomy\nfor peering into the hearts of dense structures or looking back at the state of the\nuniverse before recombination of ions and electrons into neutral atoms.\nAt high-energy accelerators, neutrinos are tertiary products of collisions\np + Target \u2192 many \u03c0, K ,\n\n(13)\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n7\n\nfollowed by the decays\n\u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc , K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ,\n\n(14)\n\nin an evacuated decay space up to a kilometer long. The decay region is followed\nby an earthen shield, perhaps made denser by the inclusion of blocks of iron or\nsteel, that absorbs photons, surviving mesons, and other hadrons, and ranges out\nmany of the muons. At Fermilab, the total length of the neutrino beam line is\nabout 3 km.\nIn the most recent study of deeply inelastic neutrino scattering at Fermilab, 800GeV protons from the Tevatron deliver 1010 neutrinos in 5 pings over 2.5 seconds\neach minute, spread over the 100 ft2 face of the NuTeV Detector. The detector is\nmade up of 690 T of iron, scintillator, and drift chambers. Events are studied from\na \"fiducial volume\" of 390 T. The 1010 neutrinos per minute produce about 10 \u2013 20\nevents that are recorded for off-line analysis. Experiments of this kind give us our\nbest look at the interior of the proton, and reveal its quark structure in exquisite\ndetail [9].\n\nNeutrino Mass\nNeutrinos are very light. No one has ever weighed a neutrino. The best kinematical determinations set upper bounds [10] on the dominant neutrino species emitted\n2\n2\nin nuclear beta decay (m\u03bde <\n\u223c 15 eV/c ), charged-pion decay (m\u03bd\u03bc < 0.19 MeV/c at\n2\n90% CL), and \u03c4 -lepton decay (m\u03bd\u03c4 < 18.2 MeV/c at 95% CL). Although there are\nprospects7 for improving these bounds-and the measurement of a nonzero mass\nwould constitute a real discovery-they are sufficiently large that it is of interest\nto consider indirect (nonkinematic) constraints from other quarters.\nIf neutrino lifetimes are greater than the age of the Universe, the requirement that\nneutrino relics from the Big Bang not overclose the Universe leads to a constraint\n2\non the sum of neutrino masses. For relatively light neutrinos (m\u03bd <\n\u223c a few MeV/c ),\nthe total mass in neutrinos,\nmtot =\n\nX\n\n1\n2\n\ngi m\u03bdi ,\n\n(15)\n\ni\n\nwhere gi is the number of spin degrees of freedom of \u03bdi plus \u03bd\u0304i , sets the scale of\nthe neutrino contribution to the mass density of the Universe, \u033a\u03bd = mtot n\u03bd \u2248\n112 mtot cm\u22123 . If we measure \u033a\u03bd as a fraction of the critical density to close the\nUniverse, \u033ac = 1.05 \u00d7 104 h2 eV/c2 cm\u22123 , where h is the reduced Hubble parameter,\nthen\n\u03a9\u03bd \u2261\n7)\n\nmtot\n\u033a\u03bd\n=\n.\n\u033ac\n94h2 eV/c2\n\n(16)\n\nSome of these prospects were reviewed at \u03bdFact '99 in Lyon by Alvaro De R\u00fajula, Ref.

A very conservative\nbound results from the assumption that \u03a9\u03bd h2 < 1: it is that mtot < 94 eV/c2 .\nRecent observations8 suggest that the total matter density is considerably smaller\nthan the critical density, so that \u03a9m \u2248 0.3. If we fix \u03a9\u03bd < \u03a9m and choose the\nplausible value h2 = 0.5 \u00b1 0.15, then we arrive at the still generous upper bound\n2\nmtot <\n\u223c 19 eV/c . Taking into account the best (and model-dependent) information\nabout the hot- and cold-dark-matter cocktail [13] needed to reproduce the observed\nfluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, it seems likely that cosmology\n2\nlimits mtot <\n\u223c a few eV/c . It is worth remarking that the cosmological desire for hot\ndark matter has been on the wane.\nIf neutrinos were exactly massless, neutrino physics would be simple. There\nwould be no pattern of masses to explain, no neutrino decays, no mixing among\nlepton generations, and no neutrino oscillations. The only question would be Why?\nIf neutrinos do have masses, the electroweak theory has more unexplained parameters: the neutrino masses, three mixing angles, and a CP-violating phase.\nNeutrinos may decay, and neutrinos can oscillate from one electroweak species to\nanother.\n\nNeutrino Oscillations9\nIn the quantum world, particles are waves. If neutrinos \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , . . . have different\nmasses m1 , m2 , . . . , each neutrino flavor may be a mixture of different masses.

Overall, a network of reactions we may summarize as\n4p \u2192 4 He + 2e+ + 2\u03bde + 25 MeV\n\n(23)\n\nleads to the spectrum of neutrinos11 shown in Figure 5. Because solar neutrinos\ninteract so feebly, they can only be detected in a very massive target and detector.\nThe Super-Kamiokande Detector in Japan consists of 50 000 tonnes of pure water\nviewed by 11 000 photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light. It is sited 1 km\nunder a mountain, under 3 kmwe. The great advantage of the Super-K detector is\nthat it detects neutrino interactions \u03bde + n \u2192 p + e\u2212 in real time, and determines\nthe neutrino direction from the electron direction. Super-K has demonstrated that\nthe brightest object in the neutrino sky is the Sun, which proves that nuclear fusion\npowers our star. The disadvantage of the water-Cherenkov technique (see Figure\n5) is that it is only sensitive to the highest-energy solar neutrinos.\nFive solar-neutrino experiments report deficits with respect to the predictions\nof the standard solar model: Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande using waterCherenkov techniques, SAGE and GALLEX using chemical recovery of germanium\nproduced in neutrino interactions with gallium, and Homestake using radiochemical\nseparation of argon produced in neutrino interactions with chlorine. These results\nsuggest the oscillation \u03bde \u2192 \u03bdx .\nCosmic rays that interact in Earth's atmosphere produce neutrinos in the decays\nof pions, kaons, and muons, in the approximate proportions \u03bd\u03bc : \u03bd\u0304\u03bc : \u03bde : \u03bd\u0304e ::\n2 : 2 : 1 : 1. Five atmospheric-neutrino experiments report anomalies in the\narrival of muon neutrinos: Kamiokande, IMB, and Super-Kamiokande using waterCherenkov techniques, and Soudan II and MACRO using sampling calorimetry.\nThe most striking result is the zenith-angle dependence of the \u03bd\u03bc rate reported\nlast year by Super-K [20,21], which is shown in Figure 6.

A single experiment reports the appearance of neutrinos that would not be\nseen in the absence of neutrino oscillations. The LSND experiment [22] reports the\nobservation of \u03bd\u0304e -like events is what should be an essentially pure \u03bd\u0304\u03bc beam produced\nat the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility, suggesting the oscillation \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e . This\nresult has not yet been reproduced by any other experiment.\nA host of experiments have failed to turn up evidence for neutrino oscillations\nin the regimes of their sensitivity. These results limit neutrino mass-squared differences and mixing angles. In more than a few cases, positive and negative claims\nare in conflict, or at least face off against each other. Over the next five years,\nmany experiments will seek to verify, further quantify, and extend these claims.\n\nThe Ultimate Neutrino Source?\nOur colleagues working to assess the feasibility of very-high-energy muon colliders\nhave given us the courage to think that it may be possible, not too many years in\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n12\n300\n\n300\n\ne-like sub-GeV\n200\n\n200\n\n100\n\n100\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u03bc-like sub-GeV\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\ncos\u0398\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos\u0398\n\n200\n\n200\n\n\u03bc-like multi-GeV\n\ne-like multi-GeV\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\ncos\u0398\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos\u0398\n\nFIGURE 6.

It is very exciting\nto think of the possibilities that millimoles of muons would raise for studies in\nfundamental physics.\nFrom the perspective of a muon collider, the 2.2-\u03bcs lifetime of the muon presents\na formidable challenge. But if the challenge of producing, capturing, storing, and\nreplenishing many unstable muons can be met, the decays\n\u03bc\u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03bd\u03bc \u03bd\u0304e ,\n\n\u03bc+ \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u03bde\n\n(24)\n\noffer delicious possibilities for the study of neutrino interactions and neutrino properties [23\u201325]. We would have at our disposal for the first time not only neutrino\nbeams of unprecedented intensity, but also controlled beams rich in high-energy\nelectron neutrinos. In a Neutrino Factory, the composition and spectra of intense\nneutrino beams will be determined by the charge, momentum, and polarization of\nthe stored muons. The beam from a \u03bc+ storage ring contains \u03bd\u0304\u03bc and \u03bde , but no \u03bd\u03bc ,\n\u03bd\u0304e , \u03bd\u03c4 , or \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 .

We could build it at\none laboratory, pitched at a deep angle, to illuminate a laboratory on the other\nside of the globe with a neutrino beam whose properties we can control with great\nprecision. By choosing the right combination of energy and destination, we can\ntune future neutrino-oscillation experiments to the physics questions we will need\nto answer, by specifying the ratio of path length to neutrino energy and determining\nthe amount of matter the neutrinos traverse. Although we can use each muon decay\nonly once, and we will not be able to select many destinations, we may be able to\nilluminate two or three well-chosen sites from a muon-storage-ring neutrino source.\nThat possibility-added to the ability to vary the muon charge, polarization, and\nenergy-may give us just the degree of experimental control it will take to resolve\nthe outstanding questions about neutrino oscillations.\nThe Detector Challenge. To distinguish oscillations among \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , and a\npossible fourth, \"sterile,\" neutrino \u03bds that does not experience weak interactions,\nwe require a target cum detector of several kilotonnes-perhaps several tens of\nkilotonnes-that can distinguish electrons, muons, and taus, and measure their\ncharges. This is a straightforward requirement for the muons, but the short-lived\n(0.3 picosecond) \u03c4 and the eager-to-shower electron are more difficult to deal with.\n\nWHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE TOP QUARK?\nTop is a most remarkable particle, even for a quark.12 A single top quark weighs\n175 GeV/c2 , about as much as an atom of gold. But unlike the gold atom, which\ncan be disassembled into 79 protons, 79 electrons, and 118 neutrons, top seems\nindivisible, for we discern no structure at a resolution approaching 10\u221218 m. Top's\nexpected lifetime of about 0.4 yoctosecond (0.4 \u00d7 10\u221224 s) makes it by far the most\nephemeral of the quarks. The compensation for this exceedingly brief life is a\nmeasure of freedom: top decays before it experiences the confining influence of the\nstrong interaction. In spite of its fleeting existence, the top quark helps shape the\ncharacter of the everyday world.\nThe discovery experiments were carried out at Fermilab's Tevatron, in which a\nbeam of 900-GeV protons collides with a beam of 900-GeV antiprotons.

Both the b-quark and the W -boson are themselves\nunstable, with many multibody decay modes. The b-quark's mean lifetime is about\n1.5 ps. It can be identified by a decay vertex displaced by a fraction of a millimeter\nfrom the production point, or by the low-momentum electron or muon from the\nsemileptonic decays b \u2192 ce\u03bd, b \u2192 c\u03bc\u03bd, each with branching fraction about 10%.\nThe W boson decays after only 0.3 ys on average into e\u03bd\u0304e , \u03bc\u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 , or a quark and\nantiquark (observed as two jets of hadrons), with probabilities 1/9, 1/9, 1/9, and\n2/3. The characteristic modes in which tt\u0304 production can be sought are shown with\ntheir relative weights in Figure 7. Dilepton events (e\u03bc, ee, and \u03bc\u03bc) are produced\nprimarily when both W bosons decay into e\u03bd or \u03bc\u03bd. Events in the lepton +\njets channels (e, \u03bc + jets) occur when one W boson decays into leptons and the\nother decays through quarks into hadrons. Another challenge to experiment is the\ncomplexity of events in high-energy p\u0304p collisions. The top and antitop are typically\naccompanied by scores of other particles. The discovery experiments scanned 106\nevents per second.\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n15\n\nFIGURE 8. A pair of top quarks reconstructed in the CDF experiment at Fermilab.

Boosting the Tevatron's energy to\n1 TeV per beam will increase the top yield by nearly 40%. Further enhancements\nto Fermilab's accelerator complex are under study. A decade from now, the Large\nHadron Collider at CERN will produce tops at more than ten thousand times\nthe rate of the discovery experiments. Electron-positron linear colliders or muon\ncolliders may add new opportunities for the study of top-quark properties and\ndynamics. In the meantime, the network of understanding known as the standard\nmodel of particle physics links the properties of top to many phenomena to be\nexplored in other experiments.\nHow can we expect new experiments to extend our knowledge of the top quark?13\nTevatron Run 2, to begin in March 2001, is to accumulate 2 fb\u22121 of integrated\nluminosity.

It should be possible to determine the t \u2192 bW coupling in\nsingle-top production: \u00b110% in Run 2, \u00b15% in Run 2bis . One of the exploratory\ngoals of the new round of experiments will be to search for tt\u0304 resonances, rare\ndecays, and deviations from the expected pattern of top decays. Finally, it may\nprove possible to begin to probe the ephemeral lifetime of top. On the theoretical\nfront, the large mass of top encourages us to think that the two problems of mass\nmay be linked at the electroweak scale.\n\nTop Matters!\nIt is popular to say that top quarks were produced in great numbers in the fiery\ncauldron of the Big Bang some fifteen billion years ago, disintegrated in the merest\nfraction of a second, and vanished from the scene until my colleagues learned to\ncreate them in the Tevatron. That would be reason enough to care about top: to\nlearn how it helped sow the seeds for the primordial universe that evolved into our\nworld of diversity and change. But it is not the whole story; it invests the top\nquark with a remoteness that veils its importance for the everyday world.\nThe real wonder is that here and now, every minute of every day, the top quark\naffects the world around us. Through the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, top quarks and antiquarks wink in and out of an ephemeral presence in\nour world. Though they appear virtually, fleetingly, on borrowed time, top quarks\nhave real effects.\nQuantum effects make the coupling strengths of the fundamental interactions-\nappropriately normalized analogues of the fine-structure constant \u03b1-vary with the\nenergy scale on which the coupling is measured. The fine-structure constant itself\nhas the familiar value 1/137 in the low-energy (or long-wavelength) limit, but grows\nto about 1/129 at the mass of the Z 0 boson, about 91 GeV/c2 . Vacuum-polarization\neffects make the effective electric charge increase at short distances or high energies.\nIn unified theories of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions, all the\ncoupling \"constants\" take on a common value, \u03b1U , at some high energy, MU . If we\nadopt the point of view that \u03b1U is fixed at the unification scale, then the mass of\nthe top quark is encoded in the value of the strong coupling \u03b1s that we experience\nat low energies.14 Assuming three generations of quarks and leptons, we evolve \u03b1s\ndownwards in energy from the unification scale.15 The leading-logarithmic behavior\nis given by\n1/\u03b1s (Q) = 1/\u03b1U +\n14)\n\n21\nln(Q/MU ) ,\n6\u03c0\n\n(28)\n\nAll the important features emerge in an SU (5) unified theory that contains the standardmodel gauge group SU (3)c \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y . The final result is more general.\n15)\nThe strategy is explained in Ref. [29].\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n1/\u03b1U\n\n18\n\n\u274a\n2mt'\n21/6\u03c0\n2mb\n\n\"1/\u03b1s\"\n\n23/6\u03c0\n2mt\n\n2mc\n25/6\u03c0\n\n27/6\u03c0\n\nMU\n\n\"log(E)\"\n\nFIGURE 10. Two evolutions of the strong coupling constant \u03b1s . A smaller value of the\ntop-quark mass leads to a smaller value of \u03b1s .\n\nfor MU > Q > 2mt . The positive coefficient +21/6\u03c0 means that the strong coupling\nconstant \u03b1s is smaller at high energies than at low energies. This behavior-\nopposite to the familiar behavior of the electric charge-is the celebrated property\nof asymptotic freedom. In the interval between 2mt and 2mb , the slope (33 \u2212\n2nf )/6\u03c0 (where nf is the number of active quark flavors) steepens to 23/6\u03c0, and\nthen increases by another 2/6\u03c0 at every quark threshold. At the boundary Q = Qn\nbetween effective field theories with n\u22121 and n active flavors, the coupling constants\n\u03b1s(n\u22121) (Qn ) and \u03b1s(n) (Qn ) must match. This behavior is shown by the solid line in\nFigure 10. The dotted line in Figure 10 shows how the evolution of 1/\u03b1s changes\nif the top-quark mass is reduced. A smaller top mass means a larger low-energy\nvalue of 1/\u03b1s , so a smaller value of \u03b1s .\nTo discover the dependence of \u039bQCD upon the top-quark mass, we calculate\n\u03b1s (2mt ) evolving up from low energies and down from the unification scale, and\nmatch:\n1/\u03b1U +\n\n21\n25\n23\nln(2mt /MU ) = 1/\u03b1s (2mc ) \u2212\nln(mc /mb ) \u2212\nln(mb /mt ).\n6\u03c0\n6\u03c0\n6\u03c0\n\n(29)\n\nIdentifying\n1/\u03b1s (2mc ) \u2261\n\n27\nln(2mc /\u039bQCD ) ,\n6\u03c0\n\n(30)\n\nwe find that\n\u039bQCD = e\u22126\u03c0/27\u03b1U\n\n\u0012\n\nMU\n1 GeV\n\n\u001321/27 \u0012\n\n2mt * 2mb * 2mc\n1 GeV3\n\n\u00132/27\n\nGeV .\n\n(31)\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n19\n\nThanks to QCD, we have learned that the dominant contribution to the lighthadron masses is not the masses of the quarks of which they are constituted, but the\nenergy stored up in confining the quarks in a tiny volume.16 Our most useful tool in\nthe strong-coupling regime is lattice QCD. Calculating the light hadron spectrum\nfrom first principles has been one of the main objectives of the lattice program,\nand important strides have been made recently. In 1994, the GF11 Collaboration\n[31]carried out a quenched calculation of the spectrum (no dynamical fermions) that\nyielded masses that agree with experiment within 5\u201310%, with good understanding\nof the residual systematic uncertainties. The CP-PACS Collaboration centered in\nTsukuba has embarked on an ambitious program that will soon lead to a full\n(unquenched) calculation [32].\nNeglecting the tiny \"current-quark\" masses of the up and down quarks, the scale\nparameter \u039bQCD is the only mass parameter in QCD. It determines the scale of\nthe confinement energy that is the dominant contribution to the proton mass. To\na good first approximation,\nMproton \u2248 C\u039bQCD ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality C is calculable using techniques of lattice\nfield theory.\nWe conclude that, in a simple unified theory,\nMproton\nmt\n\u221d\n1 GeV\n1 GeV\n\u0012\n\n\u00132/27\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\nThis is a wonderful result. Now, we can't use it to compute the mass of the\ntop quark, because we don't know the values of MU and \u03b1U , and haven't yet\ncalculated precisely the constant of proportionality between the proton mass and\nthe QCD scale parameter. Never mind! The important lesson-no surprise to any\ntwentieth-century physicist-is that the microworld does determine the behavior\nof the quotidian. We will fully understand the origin of one of the most important\nparameters in the everyday world-the mass of the proton-only by knowing the\nproperties of the top quark.17\n\nWHAT IS THE DIMENSIONALITY OF SPACETIME?\nOrdinary experience tells us that spacetime has 3 + 1 dimensions. Could our\nperceptions be limited? That is the question raised allegorically in Flatland, a\nVictorian fable published in 1880 by a British schoolmaster, Edwin Abbott Abbott\n(1839 \u2013 1926), and still widely available [34].\n16)\n\nAn accessible essay on our understanding of hadron mass appears in Ref. [30].\nFor a fuller development of the influence of standard-model parameters on the everyday world,\nsee Ref. [33].\n17)\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n20\n\nLike any question that tests our preconceptions and unspoken assumptions,\n\"What is the dimensionality of spacetime?\" is a legitimate scientific question,\nto which we should return from time to time. It is given immediacy by recent theoretical work. For its internal consistency, string theory requires an additional six or\nseven space dimensions, beyond the 3 + 1 dimensions of everyday experience. Until\nrecently it has been presumed that the extra dimensions must be compactified on\nthe Planck scale, with a compactification radius\nRunobserved \u2243\n\n1\nMPlanck\n\n=\n\n1\n= 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221235 m .\n19\n2\n1.22 \u00d7 10 GeV/c\n\n(34)\n\nPart of the vision of string theory is that what goes on in the small curled-up\ndimensions does affect the everyday world: excitations of the Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds\ndetermine the fermion spectrum, for example.18\nThe great gap between the electroweak scale of about 103 GeV and the Planck\nscale of about 1019 GeV gives rise to the hierarchy problem of the electroweak theory\n[36]. The conventional approach to new physics has been to extend the standard\nmodel to understand why the electroweak scale (and the mass of the Higgs boson)\nis so much smaller than the Planck scale. A novel approach that has evolved over\nthe past two years is instead to change gravity to understand why the Planck scale\nis so much greater than the electroweak scale [37]. Now, experiment tells us that\ngravitation closely follows the Newtonian force law down to distances on the order\nof 1 mm. Let us parameterize deviations from a 1/r gravitational potential in terms\nof a relative strength \u03b5G and a range \u03bbG , so that\nV (r) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\ndr1\n\nZ\n\ndr2\n\nGNewton \u03c1(r1 )\u03c1(r2 )\n[1 + \u03b5G exp(\u2212r12 /\u03bbG )] ,\nr12\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u03c1(ri ) is the mass density of object i and r12 is the separation between body\n1 and body 2. Elegant experiments that study details of Casimir and Van der\nWaals forces imply bounds on anomalous gravitational interactions, as shown in\nFigure 11. Below about a millimeter, the constraints on deviations from Newton's\ninverse-square force law deteriorate rapidly, so we are free to consider changes to\ngravity even on a small but macroscopic scale.\nThat is precisely the possibility raised by the interesting new idea that some extra\ndimensions of spacetime might be-relatively speaking-large.19 The new idea is\nto consider that the SU(3)c \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 U(1)Y standard-model gauge fields, plus\nneeded extensions, reside on 3 + 1-dimensional branes, not in the extra dimensions,\nbut that gravity can propagate into the extra dimensions. How does this hypothesis\nchange the picture? The dimensional analysis (Gauss's law, if you like) that relates\nNewton's constant to the Planck scale changes. If gravity propagates not only in\n18)\n\nFor a gentle introduction to the aspirations of string theory, see Ref.

Any particle can radiate a graviton into extra dimensions.\nAn extradimensional graviton is only gravitationally coupled, and so will not interact in the detector: the gravitons go off into extra dimensions and are lost.\nTheir signature is missing energy, E\n/ T . These processes, individually tiny, may\nbe observable because the number of excitable modes is very large. Many authors [39] have considered the gravitational excitation of a tower of Kaluza\u2013Klein\nmodes in the extra dimensions, which would give rise to a missing (transverse)\nenergy signature in collider experiments [40]. We call these excitations provatons,\nafter the Greek word \u03c0\u03c1\u00f3\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4 o for a sheep in a flock. For proton-antiproton collisions, the experimental signatures include p\u0304p \u2192 jet + E\n/ T (parton + graviton), and\np\u0304p \u2192 l+ l\u2212 + E\n/ T (l+ l\u2212 + graviton).\nThe Detector Challenge. To establish a jet+ E\n/ T signature at a hadron collider, we\nrequire a hermetic detector with well-controlled E\n/ T tails to establish and quantify\nthe missing-energy signature; highly efficient rejection of cosmic-ray and accidental\ntriggers; the ability to reject triggers originating from jet mismeasurements; and\ncontrol over physics backgrounds, including Z 0 + jets and W \u00b1 + jets. The experimental sensitivity to provatons depends on collider energy, luminosity, and species,\nand the number of large extra dimensions.\nA representative analysis of the constraints that may be inferred from anomalous\nsingle photon production at e+ e\u2212 colliders and from monojet production at hadron\ncolliders if no signal is seen is shown in Table 2. If a missing-energy signal is found,\nit will be a challenge to distinguish an extradimensional signal from the classic\nR-parity\u2013conserving signature for supersymmetry. We should be so lucky!\n\nThe Outlook for Extra Dimensions\nWe are only beginning to explore the possible implications of almost-accessible\nextra dimensions. Among the fascinating new worlds to explore are the Randall\u2013\nSundrum mechanism for localizing gravity in an extra dimension (in the vicinity of\na brane or domain wall) [42], and the speculation of Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz\nthat the fermion mass hierarchy reflects fermion wave packets separated in an\nextra dimension [43]. The characteristic missing-energy signature of a Kaluza\u2013Klein\n\n\fFERMILAB\u2013CONF\u201300/041\u2013T\n\n24\n\nexcitation will be hard to distinguish from other new physics. We need to think\nin more detail about the backgrounds and optimal search techniques. The search\nfor large extra dimensions reinforces the informative metaphor of a collider and its\ndetectors as an ultramicroscope. Are extra dimensions large enough to see? It is\nalso interesting to consider what might we observe above the threshold for exciting\nextra dimensions. Although the basic concepts that underlie these speculations\nhave a sound basis in string theory, most of the scenarios put forward so far have\nmore to do with storytelling than with theoretical rigor. However, it is plain that\nour inability to disprove at once the outlandish idea of large extra dimensions is a\nmeasure of the potential for experimental surprises, and an indication of Nature's\ncapacity to amaze us!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nTo a great degree, the progress of particle physics has followed from progress\nin accelerator science and instrumentation. There is no substitute for experiment,\nand experiment requires inventions in both hardware and software and continuous\ninnovation in analysis. The slogan, \"Yesterday's sensation is today's calibration\nand tomorrow's background,\"22 embodies both the challenge and the opportunity\nof advances in experimental technique.\nIn the middle of the revolution we are experiencing-indeed, making-in our\nconception of Nature, when we deal with fundamental questions about our world,\nincluding\nWhat are the symmetries of Nature, and how are they hidden from us?\nAre the quarks and leptons composite?\nAre there new forms of matter, like the superpartners suggested by supersymmetry?\nAre there more fundamental forces?\nWhat makes an electron an electron, a neutrino a neutrino, and a top\nquark a top quark?\nWhat is the dimensionality of spacetime?\nwe cannot advance without new instruments that extend our senses and allow us to\ncreate-and understand-new experience far beyond the realm of everyday human\nexperience.\nI wish you a productive two weeks in Istanbul, and hope that what you learn\nabout instrumentation, the spirit of experimentation, and the habits of mind necessary to make detectors act as reliable extensions of our senses will open new\nhorizons for you and for science.\n22)\n\nI believe that this formulation is due to V.
