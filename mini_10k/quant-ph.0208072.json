Today there remain two\nbig challenges for this approach: to form a relativistic version, and a version\nsuitable for quantum field theory (QFT). Here we shall address the latter.\nWe describe a general and particularly natural way of extending Bohmian\nmechanics to QFTs, explicitly giving the equations for a simple example.\nBohm himself proposed [2, p. 230] that Bohmian mechanics should be\nextended to QFT by means of the incorporation of the actual field configuration, guided by a wave functional (the state vector). In contrast, John Bell\nproposed a model [1, p. 173] in which, instead of the field configuration, the\nlocal beables are the fermion numbers at each site of a lattice discretizing 3space. We argue that it is instructive to modify Bell's proposal in two ways,\nand thus get a similar but even simpler theory with a direct connection to\nBohmian mechanics. Below, we give an explicit example of such a theory for\na particularly simple Hamiltonian.\nBell's model contains no beables representing the bosonic degrees of freedom (such as radiation), neither an actual field, nor actual particles, nor\nanything else; the existence of a radiation part of the state vector is relevant\nonly to the behavior of the fermions. This is certainly consistent and empirically irrefutable, but it is neither necessary (as our example below shows),\nnor even a natural view.1 In the model proposed below, the bosons have the\nsame status as the fermions: they are particles, described by their positions.\nThis, of course, should not be regarded as discouraging consideration of the\napproach based on actual field configurations.\nThe other deviation from Bell's proposal is the replacement of the lattice\nby continuous space. The lattice was introduced in the first place for the\npurpose of providing an effective ultraviolet cut-off and thus a well-defined\nHamiltonian. Such a cut-off, however, can also be realized by smearing out\nthe interaction Hamiltonian through convolution with, say, a sharply peaked\nbut bounded function \u03c6. The continuum analogue of the particle number\nat every lattice site is the position of all particles in ordinary space, with\nthe total number of particles N(t) possibly varying with time. However, in\n1\n\nAfter all, if the role of the wave function is to guide particles, it would seem that\nthere should be as many particles as there are variables in the wave function. In addition,\nthe Hilbert space of the radiation degrees of freedom (unlike the one for quark color) is\nnot a purely abstract Hilbert space, but is related to space-time points (via creation and\nannihilation operators, for example), a fact that would seem surprising if the state vector\nwere not related to space-time objects such as particles, strings, or fields.\n\n2\n\n\fthe model we propose the particles follow Bohmian trajectories, except when\nthere is particle creation or annihilation. (For a discussion of how Bohmian\nmechanics arises from a lattice model (in the absence of interaction) in the\nlimit of vanishing lattice width, see [8, 9].)\nOur proposal profits, we believe, from making this contact with Bohmian\nmechanics, since then every argument for taking the Bohmian trajectories\nseriously also provides some support for the proposal. Bohmian mechanics\nalso profits from this contact because the Bohmian trajectories can then be\ntaken seriously even in the framework of QFT.\nOur moving configuration Q(t) is constructed in such a way that it is\nrandom with distribution at time t equal to \u03c1(t) = |\u03a8(t)|2, where \u03a8(t) is the\n(position) Fock space representation of the state vector |\u03a8(t)i at time t. (For\na model in which there are only bosons, the n-particle component of \u03a8 is\n1\n\u03a8(n) (x1 , . . . , xn ) = \u221a h0|a(x1 ) * * * a(xn )|\u03a8i\n(1)\nn!\nR\nwhere |0i is the Fock vacuum and a(x) = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 d3 k eik*x ak is the boson annihilation operator at position x.) In particular, the probability that\nN(t) = n, i.e., that there are n particles at time t, equals the integral of \u03c1(t)\nover K (n) \u223c\n= (R3 )n (suitably symmetrized), the n-particle sector of configuration space-i.e., the L2 norm of the projection of |\u03a8i onto the n-particle\nsubspace of Fock space. A nontrivial superposition of quantum states with\ndifferent particle numbers leads to a probability distribution over different\nparticle numbers, among which only one is, of course, actually realized.\n\n2\n\nConfiguration Jumps\n\nThe Hamiltonian for QFTs is typically a sum of terms, each of which yields a\ncontribution to the motion we wish to propose. It is quite generally the case\nthat H = H0 + Hint where the free Hamiltonian H0 corresponds naturally\nto a deterministic motion-in the model considered here that of Bohmian\nmechanics, and in a relativistic model for example the Bohm\u2013Dirac motion\n[2, p. 274]-given by a (time-dependent) velocity field v = v \u03a8(t) (q, t), on\nconfiguration space K = \u222an K (n) , that defines the \"deterministic part\" of\nthe process, while the interaction term Hint corresponds to random jumps,\na continuum version of the process proposed by Bell [1, p. 173], defined by\njump rates \u03c3 = \u03c3(q \u2032 , q, t) = \u03c3 \u03a8(t) (q \u2032 , q) for a transition from q to q \u2032 at time t.\n3\n\n\f[This means that when the actual configuration Q at time t is q, then with\nprobability (density, with respect to q \u2032 ) \u03c3(q \u2032 , q, t) dt, Q will jump from (very\nnear) q to q \u2032 in the time-interval (t, t + dt).]2\nThe relevant continuum analogue of Bell's jump rates for H = Hint ,\nequations (6\u20138) of [1, p. 173], is\n\u0011+\n\u0010\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a8(q)hq|H\n|q\ni\u03a8(q\n)\n\u2212\nIm\nint\n2\n\u03c3 \u03a8 (q \u2032 , q) =\n(2)\n~\n\u03a8(q)\u03a8(q)\nwhere for particles with spin the two products in the numerator and the\nproduct in the denominator are local spinor inner products, and where we\nhave used the notation A+ = max(A, 0) for the positive part of A \u2208 R. This\nwill typically be well-defined (as jump rates), since the kernel hq|Hint |q \u2032i of\nthe (cut-off) interaction Hamiltonian of a QFT should involve nothing worse\nthan \u03b4-function singularities.\nThe complete process, corresponding to the total Hamiltonian, is then\ngiven by the deterministic motion with velocity v, randomly interrupted by\njumps, with rate \u03c3, after each of which the deterministic motion is resumed\nuntil it is again interrupted. As a function of t, each realization Q(t) is thus\npiecewise smooth. At the end of a smooth piece, Q jumps to the starting\npoint of the next smooth piece. What is stochastic about Q are the times\nat which the jumps take place, and the destinations of the jumps. The\nprobabilities for times and destinations are governed by the wave function.\nQ(t) is a Markov process.\nAs described, our process is so designed as to directly imply the following\nequivariance theorem: If Q(t0 ) is chosen at random with distribution |\u03a8(t0 )|2 ,\nthen at every later time t > t0 , Q(t) is distributed with density |\u03a8(t)|2 . (This\ncan also be explicitly checked by comparing the equation for \u2202(\u03a8\u03a8)/\u2202t as\nimplied by the evolution equation of the quantum state, i~ \u2202\u03a8/\u2202t = H\u03a8,\nand the master equation for the distribution of Q(t), which reads\n\u0010\n\u0011 Z\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u03c1(q, t) = \u2212\u2207* \u03c1(q, t) v(q, t) + dq \u2032 \u03c1(q \u2032 , t) \u03c3(q, q \u2032, t)\u2212\u03c1(q, t) \u03c3(q \u2032 , q, t) . )\n\u2202t\nK\nThe choice of jump rates that will make the |\u03a8|2 distribution equivariant\nis not unique. But the 'minimal' jump rates are unique, and these are the ones\n2\n\nOne can\nR regard the jumps as having two ingredients: A jump occurs with total rate\n\u03c3\u0304(q, t) = \u03c3(q \u2032 , q, t) dq \u2032 ; when a jump does occur, the destination is randomly chosen with\ndistribution \u03c3(q \u2032 , q, t)/\u03c3\u0304(q, t).\n\n4\n\n\fwe have chosen. Details on the choice of jump rates as well as an elucidation\nof the general mathematical structure underlying equivariant processes will\nbe presented in [3].\nCorresponding to the standard interaction terms in QFT, the possible\njumps are very restricted: there are only changes in the particle number by\n\u00b11, and possible types are (i) appearance or (ii) disappearance of a particle\n(while the others remain at their positions) or (iii) replacement of a particle\nby two others or (iv) the reverse of this. Type (i) is appropriate for, e.g.,\nphoton emission, (ii) for absorption, (iii) for pair creation and (iv) for pair\nannihilation. (It follows that there is no discontinuity in the individual particle world lines, in spite of the discontinuity in Q.) In our explicit model,\nonly types (i) and (ii) occur.\n\n3\n\nAn Explicit Model\n\nWe now present an explicit theory. It is based on a \"baby\" QFT taken from\n[6, p. 339] and [5], containing two species of particles, which we simply call\nelectrons and photons. Electrons, whose number stays constant, emit and\nabsorb photons. To keep things simple, we employ nonrelativistic dispersion\nrelations (as everything here is nonrelativistic) for both electrons and photons, and give the photon a positive (rest) mass. In addition, we ignore spin\nand polarization, and, of course, smoothen the interaction Hamiltonian.\nIn field theoretic language, we have a bosonic field \u03c6(x) = a\u2020 (x) + a(x),\nwith a\u2020 and a the photon creation and annihilation operators [cf. equations\n(4) and (5)] and a fermionic field \u03c8(x), and the Hamiltonian is the sum\nH\n\n= HF + HBZ + Hint\n3\n\n\u2020\n\n= (1/2mF ) d x \u2207\u03c8 (x)\u2207\u03c8(x) + (1/2mB )\nZ\n+g d3 x \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c6\u03c6 (x)\u03c8(x)\n\nZ\n\nd3 x \u2207a\u2020 (x)\u2207a(x)\n\n\u0001\nR\nwhere \u03c6\u03c6 (x) = d3 y \u03c6(x \u2212 y)a\u2020 (y) + \u03c6(x \u2212 y)a(y) is the cutoff bosonic\nfield, mF and mB denote the mass of the electrons and photons, and g is\na real Rcoupling constant. H commutes with the fermion number operator\nNF = d3 x \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8(x).\nSince the fermion number is conserved, we give it a fixed valueSN. The\n(m)\nconfiguration space (changing notation slightly from before) is K = \u221e\nm=0 K\n5\n\n\fwhere m is the photon number and\nK (m) := (R3 )N \u00d7 (R3 )m ,\n\nK (0) = (R3 )N .\n\nWe will denote the electron coordinates by x := x(N ) := (x1 , . . . , xN ) and\nthe photon coordinates by y := y (m) = (y 1 , . . . , y m ). The full configuration\nis thus given by q = (x, y) and, more explicitly, by q (m) = (x, y (m) ).\nIn terms of the wave function \u03a8 [the (position) Fock representation of the\nquantum state], the Hilbert space inner product is\n\u221e Z\nX\nh\u03a6|\u03a8i :=\nd3N x d3m y \u03a6(x, y) \u03a8(x, y) ,\nm=0\n\nK (m)\n\nand the contributions to the Hamiltonian assume the form\nX ~2\nHF = \u2212\n\u2206i\n2m\nF\ni\nHB = \u2212\nand\nHint = g\n\nN\nX\n\nX ~2\n\u2206j\n2mB\nj\n\ni\n\n\u03c6\u03c6 (x ) = g\n\ni=1\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\na\u2020\u03c6 (xi ) + a\u03c6 (xi )\n\n\u0001\n\n(3)\n\nwith creation and annihilation operators a\u2020\u03c6 and a\u03c6 acting on Fock space in\na smeared-out form:\nZ\n\u2020\na\u03c6 (x) =\nd3 u \u03c6(u \u2212 x) a\u2020 (u)\nZ\na\u03c6 (x) =\nd3 u \u03c6(u \u2212 x) a(u),\nwhere\n\u0001\n1 X\n\u03b4(y j \u2212 u) \u03a8(qbj ) ,\na\u2020 (u)\u03a8 (q (m) ) = \u221a\nm j\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u0001\na(u)\u03a8 (q (m) ) =\nm + 1 \u03a8 q (m) , u .\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\na\u2020\u03c6 (x) creates a new photon in state \u03c6 centered at x \u2208 R3 (which will be the\nposition of an electron), and a\u03c6 (x) annihilates a photon with \"form factor\"\n6\n\n\f\u03c6 at x.3 Here (q (m) , u) is the configuration with a photon at u added to q (m)\nand qbj is the configuration with the j-th photon deleted from q (m) .

The deterministic part of the\nmotion Q(t) = (X(t), Y (t)), corresponding to HF + HB , is the usual Bohm\nmotion\n\u0001\ni\n\u2202\u03a8/\u2202x\n(Q)\n~\n\u03a8\n\u1e8a i = vF,i\n(Q) :=\nIm\n,\n(7)\nmF\n\u03a8(Q)\n\u0001\n\u2202\u03a8/\u2202y j (Q)\n~\nj\n\u03a8\nIm\n(8)\n\u1e8e = vB,j (Q) :=\nmB\n\u03a8(Q)\nand it follows from (2) and (6) that only two kinds of jumps occur, with rates\nas follows:\n\u2022 The j-th photon vanishes, while all the other particles stay at their\npositions. Thus q \u2032 = qbj and the jump rate from q = q (m) to q \u2032 is\n2g h X\n\u03a8(qbj ) \u03c6(y j \u2212 xi ) i+\n\u03c3(q \u2032 , q) = \u221a\n\u2212\nIm\n.\n~ m\n\u03a8(q)\ni=1\nN\n\n(9)\n\n\u2022 A new photon appears at y \u2032 , while all the other particles stay at their\npositions.

There is less in this than meets the eye: The correspondence is\nan artifact of the way (2) is written, and if (2) had been written equivalently\nas\n\u0010\n\u0011+\n\u2032 )hq \u2032 |H |qi\u03a8(q)\nIm\n\u03a8(q\nint\n2\n\u03c3 \u03a8 (q \u2032 , q) =\n(11)\n~\n\u03a8(q)\u03a8(q)\nthe correspondence would have been reversed. Note also that if \u03c6 is supported\nby a \u03b4-ball around the origin of R3 , then photons can be created or annihilated\nonly in the \u03b4-neighborhood of an electron.4\nOur model is translation invariant (unless one introduces an additional\nexternal potential), time translation invariant, rotation invariant provided\n\u03c6 is spherically symmetric, time reversal invariant provided \u03c6 is real-valued,\nand gauge invariant provided one introduces an external vector potential-in\nall derivatives acting on electron coordinates-and an external scalar potential into HF . Galilean boost invariance fails, but not because of the Bohmian\nvariables; owing to the interaction term (6), it fails, in fact, for the evolution of the quantum state. The reason is that, roughly speaking, a photon\ngets created with wave function \u03c6 which cannot be Galilean invariant. Alternatively, one could say that under boosts with velocity u the form factor\n\u03c6(y \u2212 x) must be replaced by exp (imB u * y/~) \u03c6(y \u2212 x). Note that even\nwith the cutoff removed, i.e., for \u03c6(y) = \u03b4(y), the quantum dynamics is not\nGalilean invariant.\nIf we add to H a suitable confining potential (and \u03c6 is real-valued, and\nthe rest energy of the photon is made positive), it possesses a unique ground\nstate [7], and this ground state (like every nondegenerate eigenstate) is real\nup to an overall phase. Thus in this state the jump rates (9), (10) as well\nas the velocities (7), (8) vanish identically-nothing moves. Surprisingly,\nperhaps, the Bohmian particles do not perform any \"vacuum fluctuations\".\n4\n\nOne might suspect that if \u03b4 were small, there would be only a small probability\n(perhaps of order \u03b4 3 ) that a photon will come closer than \u03b4 to an electron. But equivariance\nimplies that this is not so: if a certain amount of |\u03a8(m) |2 flows to the sector K (m\u22121) , then\nthe probability for a photon to be annihilated is just as large.\n\n8\n\n\fAs in Bohmian mechanics, disentangled subsystems are governed by the\nsame laws as for the whole. More precisely, if \u03a6 and \u03a8 are two wave functions\nfrom Fock space having disjoint supports S\u03a6 and S\u03a8 in physical space R3 ,\n\u03a6 \u2297 \u03a8 defines another Fock state \u03a6 \u2299 \u03a8 after suitable symmetrization; if the\ndistance between S\u03a6 and S\u03a8 is at least the diameter \u03b4 of the support of \u03c6,\nthen in a system with wave function \u03a6 \u2299 \u03a8 the particles in S\u03a6 and those in\nS\u03a8 will not influence each other, each set moving independently according\nto the corresponding 'factors'. This is a consequence of the fact that the\nvelocities and jump rates are homogeneous of degree 0 in the wave function.\nWhile the other particles keep their positions when a photon is created\nor annihilated, their velocities may change discontinuously because (7) evaluated at the destination may differ from (7) evaluated at the point of departure. As a result, the world lines of all (possibly distant) particles, if\nthe particles are entangled, will have kinks at the times of particle creation\nor annihilation. These kinks will however not be visible in, say, a cloud\nchamber since the necessary entanglement is destroyed by the decoherence\nof the tracked particle with its environment, caused, say, by the particle's\ninteraction with the vapor.\n\n4\n\nRemoving the Cutoff\n\nRemoving the cutoff is of course problematical, which is why the cutoff was\nintroduced in the first place. However the problems arise primarily from the\nevolution equation of the wave function, not those of the Bohmian configuration, equations (7) through (10). Suppose that a family of \u03c6's is parametrized\nby \u039b \u2208 R, and that as \u039b \u2192 \u221e, \u03c6\u039b (y) approaches \u03b4(y). Then the limit\n\u039b \u2192 \u221e corresponds to \"removing the cutoff\". Unfortunately, the corresponding H \u039b will not converge in any reasonable sense. But there exist\nnumbers E \u039b tending to infinity [5] such that H \u039b \u2212 E \u039b does converge in a\nsuitable sense, and the evolution of the wave function is well-defined. This\nseems completely acceptable. We do not know whether the corresponding\nprocess Q\u039b approaches (given a fixed initial wave function) a limiting process\nQ\u221e . To decide this requires a careful mathematical study, but at least we\nsee nothing precluding this possibility: the velocity law is not affected by the\ncutoff, while absorption might become deterministic in the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e and\noccur whenever (and only when) a photon hits an electron.\nOther Hamiltonians, more sophisticated ones, are more problematical,\n9\n\n\fand do not possess a limit as \u039b \u2192 \u221e, even after subtracting an \"infinite\nenergy\". In some cases this is due to the creation of a large (average) number\nm\u039b of photons that goes to infinity with \u039b. On the other hand, it is not clear\nthat removing the cutoff is desirable or relevant. That is, there might exist\nan effective UV cutoff in nature, just as there is an effective IR cutoff (the\nfinite radius of the universe).\nBe that as it may, if the unitary evolution on some Hilbert space does\nnot survive the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e, we face a problem, one that seems particularly\nbad for Bohmian theories, which so heavily rely on the wave function and,\nconsequently, its having a well-defined unitary evolution. But appearances\nare misleading here. From a Bohmian viewpoint, the basic variable, bearing\nall the physical implications of the theory, is the configuration Q, whereas\n\u03a8 and H are only theoretical objects whose purpose is to generate a law of\nmotion for Q. And, indeed, a law for Q might arise as a limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e of the\nlaw induced by \u03a8\u039b and H \u039b ; it might be the case that while \u03a8\u039b and H \u039b do not\nhave a limit, the time evolution of Q is well defined in the limit. After all, this\nis precisely what occurs when one consider the limit ~ \u2192 0 of nonrelativistic\nquantum mechanics: while the Hamiltonian and wave function do not have\nany sensible limit, the law for Q does!\n\n5\n\nDeterminism\n\nWe close with a remark on (the lack of) determinism. It may seem surprising\nthat we abandon determinism. Was not the main point of hidden variables\nto restore it? Actually, no. What was important was to provide a clear\nand coherent account of quantum mechanics. The simplest such account, we\nbelieve, is provided by Bohmian mechanics, which happens to be deterministic. And the simplest such account of QFT seems to be of the sort we have\npresented here, which is stochastic.\n\nReferences\n[1] Bell, J.S.: Speakable and unspeakable in quantum mechanics.
