The influence of electrostatic interactions on the ordering of sodium ions in Nax CoO2 is studied theoretically\nthrough Monte-Carlo simulations. For large x small di- or tri-vacancy clusters are stable with respect to isolated Na vacancies.\nAt commensurate fillings these small clusters order in triangular superstructures. These results agree with recent electron\ndiffraction data at x = 1/2 and 3/4. We have performed neutron La\u00fce diffraction experiments at higher x, which confirm the\npredictions of this simple model. The consequences on the properties of the electronic charges in the Co layers are discussed.\n\nIn the past decade, Nax CoO2 has emerged as a system of fundamental interest because of its high thermoelectric power, unusual magnetic properties and possibility, when hydrated, to superconduct [1]. The density x of intercalated sodium atoms tunes directly the\ndensity of states of quasi-particles in the metallic CoO2\nsheets. For simple fractional f\u0131llings, electron diffraction\n(ED) experiments [2, 3] provide evidence for the ordering of Na+ ions at room temperature. This non-trivial\norder is generally believed to be the consequence of intricate interactions between Na+ ions, mobile electrons,\nand phonons. We show here that the dominant process\ndriving this ordering is simply the Coulomb potential between Na+ ions. Sodium ions can occupy sites between\noxygen atoms, which form two interpenetrating triangular lattices denoted Na1 and Na2 . Cobalt ions lie above\nand below Na1 sites, resulting in an extra energy cost\n\u2206 = \u2206c + \u2206sr relative to an Na2 site (\u2206c in the long-range\nCoulomb part and \u2206sr a short range repulsion between\nNa and Co ions shells). Na ions are bigger than the distance between nearest Na1 and Na2 sites, forbidding simultaneous occupancy of nearest-neighboring sites and\nthat makes Coulomb energy minimization highly nontrivial. Our model Hamiltonian includes: (i) a long-range\nCoulomb potential, e/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u03b50 r) (the dielectric constant,\ntaken as isotropic, is f\u0131xed at \u03b5 = 6 to account quantitatively for the variations of the chemical potential, in\nterms of x, measured in cell devices [4]); (ii) Na-Na ionshell repulsion V=0.04eV for neighbors on the same sub-\n\nlattice; and (iii) on-site energy \u2206sr = 0.01eV. A system\nof two sheets of Na ions, each containing a maximum\nnumber of 1176 ions, intercalated between two CoO2\nlayers (with periodic boundary conditions in 3 dimensions) is simulated at f\u0131nite temperature and f\u0131xed chemical potential \u03bc through a Grand-Canonical Monte-Carlo\nmethod. The hexagonal cell parameters a=2.84\u00c5 and\nc=10.87\u00c5 are f\u0131xed to those measured in the x = 0.75\nphase, and elastic deformations are neglected. We maintain neutrality at each step by varying the charges in the\nCo layers assuming a uniform spreading.\nThe organization of Na ions is driven by the spontaneous formation of multivacancy clusters, as illustrated\nin Figure 1. At large distance d, the repulsion energy between two vacancies decreases as 1/d. However neighboring vacancies can reduce their energy by promotion of\na Na2 sodium to the central Na1 site. The resultant cluster has a net charge 2e\u2212 spread over three sites and substantially lower energy, as the central sodium is now further from its neighbors. Formation of a tri-vacancy cluster follows a similar process and three vacancies combine\nwith three Na2 \u2192 Na1 promotions.\nMonte-Carlo results at room temperature are presented\nin Figure 2. The Na concentration versus chemical potential is characterized by plateaus at x = 31 , 12 , 57 , 43 , comparable to those appearing in electrochemical cells [4].\nThe the 21 -plateau corresponds to an {a'=2a-b, b'=2b}\nordered structure with equal occupation of Na1 and Na2\nsites in perfect agreement with ED spectra [2]. It can be\n\n\f1\n\n1.5\n\nproportion of Na2 ions\n\n3/4\n\n5/7\n\n0.6\n1/2\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n1/3\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n\u03bc (eV)\n\n-2\n\nFIGURE 2. Na concentration x (solid line) and relative proportion of Na2 sites (dashed line) versus chemical potential \u03bc\n\nIn conclusion, at x > 12 , the ordering of sodium ions\ngoverns the electronic and magnetic properties of quasiparticles (holes) in the Co layers. Pure electrostatics with\nnon-trivial constraints on a bipartite lattice leads to vacancy clustering. For simple fractional f\u0131llings di- and\ntrivacancy clusters order long range.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nK. Takada et al. Nature, 422, 53-55 (2003).\nH.W. Zandbergen et al.

The 57 structure is a {a'=2a+b, b'=-a+3b} triangular array of\ndivacancies. At x = 34 a triangular array {a' = 2a + 2b,\nb'= -2a+4b} of trivacancies is obtained, in agreement\nwith ED [2, 3]. No plateau is observed at higher x, but\nshort-range ordered random mixing of di- trivacancies\nappears in the simulations. Nevertheless, at x > 0.8 many\ncommensurate triangular arrays of di- trivacancies are\npossible and we have therefore investigated experimentally this range though neutron diffraction.\nSingle crystal data were collected on the SXD diffractometer at the ISIS pulsed neutron source, Rutherford\nAppleton Laboratory (UK) with area detectors covering\na solid angle of 2\u03c0 steradians. At x = 0.92 \u00b1 0.03, Figure 3 shows superstructure peaks appearing on a circle of\nradius q\u0303 \u2248 6.16nm\u22121 centered on the main Bragg points.\nThese are compatible with a triangular array of divacancies with unit-cell vectors {a'=3a+b, b'=-a+4b}.\nSodium ordering induces a periodic Coulomb potential in the Co layers. The depth of the electrostatic potential wells, \u2248100meV, is substantially larger than the\nquasi-particle hopping frequency \u224810meV and so will\nlocalize holes. While total energy differences are insignif\u0131cant (\u22480.1meV), the Coulomb landscape varies\ndrastically in terms of position of vacancy clusters in\nsuccessive layers along c. For x = 12 there are only\ntwo conf\u0131gurations. Figure 4 (a) corresponds to divacancies in successive layers displaced by b. It has a onedimensional character with high (dark) and low (light)\nCoulomb-potential stripes in agreement with the low\nand high spin charge-ordered stripes found using neutron diffraction [5]. A large magnetic f\u0131eld parallel to the\n(a,b) plane favors alignment of holes (divacancies) in the\nc-direction corresponding to Figure 4 (b) with 2D character and conducting Co ions at intermediate valencies\n(gray circles). This could explain the abrupt change from\nan insulating antiferromagnet to a conducting state with\nreconstruction of a 2D Fermi surface when a f\u0131eld of 40T\nis applied at T=50K [6]. The potentials corresponding to\nthe x = 57 and 43 structures are discussed in Ref. [7].\n\nd/a\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3\nd/a\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFIGURE 1. Di- and tri-vacancies.
