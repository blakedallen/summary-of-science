The topological cigar cohomology is the crucial ingredient in calculating\nthe closed string spectrum of topological strings on non-compact Gepner models.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nString theory is able to describe dynamics on highly curved space-times. Using exactly\nsolvable conformal field theories, Gepner constructed models with N = 2 supersymmetry\nin four dimensions, that describe string propagation on highly curved compact backgrounds\nwhich are special points in the moduli space of Calabi-Yau compactifications.\nTo code the non-trivial physics one is interested in, it often suffices to concentrate on a\nregion near a singularity, which may be embedded in a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold. It\nthen becomes interesting to describe and study exact conformal field theories that describe\nspecial points in the \"moduli space\" of non-compact Calabi-Yau's.\nFurthermore, if sufficient supersymmetry is preserved, the background allows us to study\na BPS sector of the full string theory, the topological string theory, which can be defined\nfor any flat 3 + 1 dimensional background tensored with a central charge c = 9 and N =\n2 superconformal field theory. The observables of the topological string theory lie in the\ncohomology of the BRST-operator of the twisted theory (one of the worldsheet supercharges\nof the untwisted model). We focus in this paper on the key ingredient to computing this\ncohomology, which is the calculation of the cohomology of the relevant non-rational conformal\nfield theory.\nA very large class of non-compact Gepner models (though not all [1, 2]) is obtained\nby tensoring N = 2 minimal models with N = 2 Liouville theories (either in heterotic or\ntype II string theory \u2013 we concentrate on the latter here). Equivalently [3, 4, 5, 6], we can\ntensor N = 2 minimal models with superconformal cigar conformal field theories. These\ntheories come equipped with an N = 2 superconformal algebra on the worldsheet and one\ncan construct four dimensional supersymmetric string backgrounds provided the internal\nCFT has a total central charge c = 9. This constraint leaves us with a very large class of\n1\n\nUnit\u00e9 Mixte du CRNS et de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, UMR 8549.\n\n1\n\n\fnon-compact Gepner models (see e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]). Note that in general, the\nlevel k of the cigar theory can take on integer, fractional, and even irrational values (when\ncombined with yet another cigar theory at irrational central charge).\nTo be more concrete, we give a few simple examples that illustrate these general ideas.\nLower dimensional or non-critical superstring backgrounds in even dimensions have been\nextensively studied since they were first discussed in [7]. The conformal field theory (CFT)\nthat describes these non-singular non-critical string vacua are a product of the flat space\ntheory in d dimensions and an N = 2 supersymmetric generalization of the cigar background:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nSL(2, IR)\n1,d\u22121\n\u00d7 ...\n(1.1)\nIR\n\u00d7\nU (1)\nk\nIn the minimal case in which there are no other factors present, the level of the coset CFT\nis fixed to be a rational number by demanding absence of the conformal anomaly at the\nquantum level, i.e. by requiring c = 15. This fixes the supersymmetric level k in terms of the\ndimension d\n\u0012\n\u0013\n6\n3d\n+ 3+\n= 15 .\n(1.2)\n2\nk\nMoreover, one can also consider backgrounds in which the level is not uniquely fixed by the\nconstraint on the central charge. This simplest example is the class of vacua\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nSU (2)\nSL(2, IR)\n1,3\n\u00d7\n(1.3)\nIR \u00d7\nU (1)\nU (1) m\nk\nhas c = 15 only if the supersymmetric level k of the cigar is given by the fraction\nk=\n\n2m\nm+2\n\nm = 2, 3, 4 . . .\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe level of the SU (2)-coset is quantized, as it descends from a compact group.\nThese backgrounds are especially interesting in the context of non-critical holography\n[3, 14] in which these closed string backgrounds are dual to certain non-gravitational theories\nobtained by taking a double scaling limit of strings on non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds of\nthe form\nx2 + y 2 + u2 + wm = \u03bc .\n(1.5)\nThe most well studied example is that of the deformed conifold (m = 2 or k = 1). For this\ncase, it has been proven [15, 16] that the B-model on the deformed conifold has a worldsheet\ndescription as a twisted supercoset SL(2, IR)/U (1) at level k = 1. A similar relationship for\nthe more general models in (1.3) has also recently been discussed in [17], by relating these\nmodels to double scaling limits of certain matrix models.\nGood progress in the k = 1 case was possible because the full set of observables in the\ntopologically twisted coset CFT was obtained by E. Frenkel in the appendix to [15]. In\nthis paper, we address in detail the cohomology of the cigar at any level k and exhibit the\ncomplete set of topological observables by adapting the purely algebraic techniques used in\nE. Frenkel's appendix to [15]. We will find that the topological observables are in one to\none correspondence with the singular vectors in the Wakimoto modules constructed over the\nSL(2, IR) current algebra. This is reminiscent of statements in earlier work on the relation\nbetween N = 2 topological singular vectors, and their relation to SL(2, IR) singular vectors\n[18, 19, 20].\n2\n\n\fThese non compact Gepner models are also intimately connected with some bosonic string\ntheories, the most well-known example being the relationship between the k = 1 cigar and the\nc = 1 string [15]. More recently, a particular class of correlation functions in the (integer) level\nk cigar times a level k minimal model has been mapped to those in the (k, 1) bosonic minimal\nstring [21, 22, 23] 2 . The results we obtain should be instrumental in further clarifying the\nrelation between topological cosets and bosonic string theories.\nOrganization\nIn section 2, we review the worldsheet formulation of the topologically twisted supercoset\nconformal field theory. In section 3, we compute the closed string cohomology of the twisted\nsupercoset. We first discuss the integer level case in some detail in section 3.3 to clarify the\ntechniques we use. The general proof for the rational level case is given in section 3.4. An\nappendix discusses a concrete example in detail which illustrates the abstract proof in the\nmain text. It also contains some of the background in affine algebra that is useful to fully\nprove the statements in the main text.\n\nThe twisted cigar at level k\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThe N = 2 superconformal symmetry\n\nTo begin with, we consider the N = 2 supersymmetric topologically twisted cigar at level k.\nWe briefly review the construction of the conformal field theory and the twisting procedure.\nThe N = 1 currents of the parent SL(2, IR) theory at level k has affine currents J a and\nfermions \u03c8 a that satisfy the OPE\nfcab J c\ngab k/2\n+\n(z \u2212 w)2\nz\u2212w\nab\nc\nif \u03c8\nJ a (z) \u03c8 b (w) \u223c c\nz\u2212w\ngab\n.\n\u03c8 a (z) \u03c8 b (w) \u223c\nz\u2212w\nJ a (z) J b (w) \u223c\n\nOur conventions are left-right symmetric, with gab = diag(+, +, \u2212) and f 123 = f\norder to define the N = 2 currents, we first define3\n\n(2.1)\n123\n\n= 1. In\n\ni a b\n\u03c8 \u03c8c .\n(2.2)\nj a = J a \u2212 J\u02c6a = J a \u2212 fbc\n2\nThe currents j a commute with the free fermions \u03c8 a and generate a bosonic SL(2, IR) at\nlevel k + 2. The Hilbert space of the original N = 1 SL(2, IR) model factorizes into a purely\nbosonic SL(2, IR) at level k+2 and three free fermions. We now implement the coset following\nKazama-Suzuki [25]. The currents of the N = 2 superconformal algebra are:\nr\n2 \u00b1 \u00b1\n\u00b1\nT = TSL(2,IR) \u2212 TU (1)\nG =\n\u03c8 j\nk\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\n2\n(2.3)\n\u03c8+ \u03c8\u2212 = \u2212 J 3 + \u03c8+ \u03c8\u2212\nJ R = \u2212 j3 + 1 +\nk\nk\nk\n2\n\nSee also [24] which relates twisted AdS3 \u00d7 S 3 with k units of flux through the S 3 to the bosonic (k, 1)\nminimal string.\n3\nWe follow the conventions in [15]. With these conventions, j 3 = J 3 + \u03c8 + \u03c8 \u2212 .\n\n3\n\n\fwhere we have defined \u03c8 \u00b1 =\n\n\u03c81\u221a\n\u00b1i\u03c82\n2\n\nand j \u00b1 =\n\nj 1\u221a\n\u00b1ij 2\n2\n\nand\n\n1\n1\nTU (1) = \u2212 J 3 J 3 + \u03c8 3 \u2202\u03c8 3 .\n(2.4)\nk\n2\nOne can check that these currents generate an N = 2 superconformal algebra with central\ncharge c = 3 + k6 .\n\n2.2\n\nGauging\n\nThe axial gauging of the coset is done by adding an extra boson X and superpartner \u03c8 X , and\nrestricting to the cohomology of an additional gauging BRST charge QU (1) , whose left-moving\ncurrent is\nr\nk\n3\nJBRST = C (J \u2212 i\n\u2202X) + \u03b3 \u2032 (\u03c8 3 \u2212 \u03c8 X ) .\n(2.5)\n2\nHere, (B, C) is a (1, 0) ghost system associated with this BRST symmetry with central charge\nc = \u22122. The field X indicates the boson which will be identified with the angular direction\nof the cigar geometry [26, 27]. The \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 superghosts combine with the fermions \u03c8 3 and \u03c8 X\nto form a Kugo-Ojima quartet that decouples from the cohomology [28]. We can therefore\nsafely ignore it in what follows.\nThe gauging current is defined to be\nr\nk\n3\n\u2202X\n(2.6)\nJg = J \u2212 i\n2\nFrom the definition, it is easy to check that it is a null-current and has non-singular operator\nproduct expansions with the energy momentum tensor T , and U (1)R current J R , and also\nwith itself. The BRST operator QU (1) of the cigar theory is defined to be\nI\nQU (1) = dz JBRST .\n(2.7)\nThe cohomology with respect to the gauging BRST operator is standard to compute [29][30].\nThe calculation essentially follows from the QU (1) exactness of both the total scaling operator,\nas well as the total charge in the gauged direction, and from the fact these operators are\ndiagonalizable in the Hilbert space. Those facts imply that non-trivial cohomology elements\ncarry no oscillator excitations in the original gauged direction, nor in the auxiliary direction\nX. Also, the gauging locks the charge in the direction X to the charge in the gauged direction\nof the original model. (There is a trivial degeneracy in the zero-mode of the ghosts which we\ncan safely ignore.) The details of this cohomological calculations are discussed in [30]. The\nnet result, as explained, is according to intuition: excitations in the gauged directions are\nremoved from the theory.\n\n2.3\n\nWakimoto Representation of SL(2, IR)\n\nIn what follows, we will make good use of the Wakimoto free field representation of the\nSL(2, IR) currents:\nj\u2212 = \u03b2\nr\n\nk\n\u2202\u03c6\n2\n\u221a\nj + = \u03b2 \u03b3 2 + 2k \u03b3 \u2202\u03c6 + (k + 2) \u2202\u03b3.\nj3 = \u03b2 \u03b3 +\n\n4\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fField\nX\n\u03c6\n(\u03c8 + , \u03c8 \u2212 )\n(\u03b2, \u03b3)\n(B, C)\n\n\u2206\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n(1/2, 1/2)\n(1, 0)\n(1, 0)\n\nQ\nq0\n\n2\nk\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nc\n1\n1 + k6\n1\n2\n\u22122\n\nTable 1: List of fields in the untwisted theory, their conformal weight \u2206, the background\ncharge Q for the bosons and the central charge c.\nThe energy momentum tensor in these variables is given by\n1\n1\n1\n1\nT(SL(2,IR) = \u03b2 \u2202\u03b3 \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u221a \u2202 2 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8 + \u2202\u03c8 \u2212 \u2212 \u03c8 \u2212 \u2202\u03c8 + .\n2\n2\n2\n2k\n\n(2.9)\n\nWe collect the various fields and some of their properties in Table 1.\n\n2.4\n\nTwisting\n\nWe consider the topologically twisted theory whose stress tensor is defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 R\nT \u2212\u2192 T + \u2202J \u2212 1 \u2212\n\u2202Jg\n2\nk\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere J R is the R-current that appears in (2.3). We have modified the usual definition\nof the twisted theory by adding a certain multiple times the gauging current Jg . As far\nas the physical obervables are concerned, this addition makes no difference, as all physical\nquantities are uncharged under the gauging current. However, the twist as defined in (2.10)\nmakes contact with early attempts [32, 21] to relate the twisted coset theory to a bosonic\nc < 1 string theory (i.e. c < 1 matter coupled to bc (reparametrization) ghosts). Let us\nsee how this comes about : using the explicit expressions for the currents in terms of the\nWakimoto free fields, the twisted energy momentum tensor in (2.10) can be written as\n1\nk+1 2\nk\u22121 2\n1\n\u2202 \u03c6 \u2212 (\u2202X)2 + i \u221a\n\u2202 X\nT = \u2212\u2202\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u221a\n2\n2\n2k\n2k\n1\n1\n3\n\u2212 \u03c8 + \u2202\u03c8 \u2212 \u2212 \u03c8 \u2212 \u2202\u03c8 + + \u2202(\u03c8 + \u03c8 \u2212 )\n(2.11)\n2\n2\n2\nWe collect in Table 2, the conformal dimensions and central charges of the twisted theory.\nWe remark here that the precise combination of R-current and gauging current in (2.10)\nwas chosen to get the coefficient of the last term in (2.11) to be precisely 3/2. From the\ntable, we see that this has caused the fermions on the cigar (\u03c8 + , \u03c8 \u2212 ) to have spins (\u22121, 2).\nFurthermore, we observe that the field content of the twisted theory is identical to the free\nfield formulation of the bosonic c < 1 string theory by identifying X with the matter field, \u03c6\nwith the Liouville field [31], and the fermions on the cigar with the (b, c) ghosts.\nThe above remark indicates that the results we obtain are pertinent to the tentative\ncorrespondence with bosonic string theories that was mentioned in the introduction (but we\nleave this question for future work). We continue to work with the (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03c6, X, b, c) variables\nin what follows, and will always consider states in the Hilbert space\nHsl2 \u2297 Hb,c \u2297 HX\n5\n\n(2.12)\n\n\fField\n\n\u2206\n\nX\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212i\n\n\u03c6\n+\n(\u03c8 , \u03c8 \u2212 )\n(\u03b2, \u03b3)\n(B, C)\n\n\u2212\n(\u22121, 2)\n(0, 1)\n(1, 0)\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\nQ\n\nc\nq \u0011\n\n2k \u2212 k2\nq\n\u221a\n2\nk + 2k\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n2\n\n1 \u2212 6 (k\u22121)\nk\n\n2\n\n1 + 6 (k+1)\nk\n\u221226\n2\n\u22122\n\nTable 2: List of fields in the twisted theory, their conformal weight \u2206, the background charge\nQ for the bosons and the central charge c.\nwhere sl2 in the subscript refers to the free field (Wakimoto) module of the bosonic SL(2, IR)\nalgebra at level k + 2 in terms of the (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03c6) variables, and Hbc and HX are the usual Fock\nspaces of the fermions and bosons. As we will see, an important grading on states in this\nproduct Hilbert space will be provided by the fermion number (charge under the bc current)\nwhich we will henceforth refer to as the ghost number, in analogy with the bosonic string.\n\n2.5\n\nThe total BRST operator\n\nIn the topologically twisted cigar theory, the BRST currents are given by\nI\nI\nI\n+\n+\n+ +\nQtop := Q = G = \u03c8 j = c j +\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhile the other twisted supercurrents are identified with\nG\u2212 = \u03c8 \u2212 j \u2212 = b \u03b2\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere we have used the Wakimoto representation for the currents, and the renaming:\nj\u2212 = \u03b2\n\n(\u03c8 + , \u03c8 \u2212 ) = (c, b) .\n\nand\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe quartet of the ghosts (\u03b2, \u03b3) and (B, C) have total central charge zero.\nWe now restrict to the cohomology of the two BRST charges associated with the gauging\nand twisting, and define the operator\n#\n!\n\"\nr\nZ\nk\n(2.16)\n\u2202X \u2212 cb + cj +\nQ = Qtop + QU (1)) = dz C j 3 \u2212 i\n2\nThus, we have a sum of two commuting BRST operators. We already gave an intuition for\nthe role of the BRST term associated to gauging. In the following we study the additional\neffect of the twisting on the set of observables, i.e. we compute the total BRST cohomology.\n\n3\n\nClosed string cohomology\n\nOur primary goal in this paper will be to compute the cohomology of Q in the Wakimoto\nmodules Wj for all positive values of the supersymmetric level k. The discussion is very much\ndependent on the submodule structure of the Wakimoto modules. In the following subsections, for the readers convenience, we will discuss cases with increasing difficulty, culminating\nin the general proof by induction for the most intricate case of rational level.\n6\n\n\fWe first collect a few general results about Wakimoto modules and their cohomology. As\nthe explicit Wakimoto representation of the current algebra generators suggest (see equation\n(2.8)), the Wakimoto modules Wj are defined by embeddings of the SL(2, IR) current algebra\ninto free fields such that the modules Wj are free over the Lie subalgebra spanned by jn3\nfor n < 0 and jn\u2212 for n \u2264 0 and co-free over the Lie subalgebra spanned by jn\u2212 for n > 0.\n(Co-free means that the dual representation is free with respect to this generator. Here, it is\nan invariant way of encoding that the operators \u03b3\u2212n act freely as creation operators on the\nvacuum.)\n\u2022 For j \u2265 \u2212 21 , the Wakimoto modules are isomorphic to the Verma modules built on the\nsame highest weight state while for j \u2264 \u2212 12 , it is the dual Wj\u2217 that is isomorphic to the\nVerma module. This was proven in [33] by explicitly comparing determinant formulae\ncomputed in the respective modules, and by constructing a bijective map. (We use here\nthat the supersymmetric level k of the cigar is positive.)\n\u2022 It should be noted then that since we can map Wakimoto modules to Verma modules,\nand vice versa, the results that we will derive for Wakimoto modules in the following\ncan straightforwardly be translated into complete results for the cohomology in Verma\nmodules as well.\n\u2022 For the dual Wakimoto module, a lemma in the appendix of [15] states that\nH q (Wj\u2217 ) = \u03b4q,1 {j}\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere q refers to the ghost number (of the corresponding operator) mentioned earlier.\nThe proof of this fact stated in [15] can be found by noting that the scaling operators\nin the (b, c) sector, as well as in the (\u03b2, \u03b3) sectors are BRST exact. Since both operators are diagonalizable, it follows that no non-trivial excitations in these directions\nare allowed for cohomologically non-trivial operators. Also, no \u03c6 oscillators are then\nallowed, because of the gauging of the U (1) current. Then, in this zero-level subspace,\none can explicitly find the form of the Qtop operator, which reduces to its zero-mode\nterm (Qtop = c0 j0+ ). It is then easy to show by direct calculation that the cohomology\ndoes indeed localize as claimed in the lemma in the appendix of [15], for any level k,\nand any dual Wakimoto module (see equation (3.1)).4\nIt turns out that the above rather straightforward calculation of a cohomology in a dual\nWakimoto module, in a specific free field realization, is the only calculation that needs to be\ndone explicitly. Indeed, we have now seen that Wakimoto modules and Verma modules are\ninterchangeable (in the sense of [33]). Moreover, the embedding diagrams between Verma\nmodules have been constructed in the ground breaking work [34] (see also [35]). It will\nturn out that the short exact sequences that follow from the embedding diagrams of Verma\nmodules, along with the specific cohomology computed above, contain sufficient information\nto compute the cohomology for all Wakimoto and Verma modules.\n\n3.1\n\nSingular vectors in Verma modules\n\nThe technique we use to compute the closed string cohomology relies on knowing the submodule structure of a given Wakimoto module, and hence on the structure of embeddings of\n4\nExplicitly, the one non-trivial state in the cohomology is the highest weight state of the dual Wakimoto\nmodule tensored with the down ghost vacuum.\n\n7\n\n\fsingular vectors in the module. Since Wakimoto modules are isomorphic to Verma modules\nor their duals, we can use the results on embedding diagrams for the latter. Recall that\nVerma modules can occur as submodules of a Verma module when they are built on singular\nvectors (which by definition are annihilated by all creation operators, and therefore constitute\na new highest weight state). A most useful result is then the location of the singular vectors\nwithin a given Verma module. The Kac-Kazhdan formula [36] states that a Verma module\nVj of spin j over the (supersymmetric) level k SL(2, IR) current algebra has singular vectors\nwhenever the spin j satisfies, for some integer r, s:\n2j + 1 = r + ks such that\n\nrs > 0\n\nor\n\nr > 0, s = 0 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nFor each solution, there is a singular vector labeled by the spin j \u2032\nj\u2032 = j \u2212 r\n\nand\n\n(3.3)\n\nand at relative conformal dimension \u2206h = rs with respect to the highest weight state in\nVj . It will turn out (see subsection 3.2) that when a Verma module has only one singular\nvector, the calculation of the cohomology is rather straightforward. It is also clear that in\nthe case when there are at least two solutions to the Kac-Kazhdan equation for a given value\nof the spin j and the level k, the level is rational. Thus, the case of irrational levels will be\n(implicitly) included when we discuss the general calculation for the case of a single singular\nvector.\n\n3.2\n\nLinear submodule structure\n\nWe start out our discussion with a very much restricted subset of all cases we consider,\nin order to connect with results already obtained in the literature first. Some steps of the\nderivation will be postponed until the full treatment in the next subsections, in order to first\nmotivate the use of the analysis.\nFor j values that satisfy 2j + 1 \u2208 kZZ, the submodule structure of the Wakimoto modules\nis very similar to those for the level k = 1, discussed in [15] and the singular vectors appear\nin a nested fashion. For j \u2265 0, the embedding diagram for the Wakimoto module Wj = Vj is\ngiven by:\nVj \u2212\u2192 V\u2212j\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Vj\u2212k \u2212\u2192 Vk\u2212j\u22121 . . . \u2212\u2192 V\u22121/2\n(3.4)\nwhere we have shown the end point V\u22121/2 of the embedding diagram that always arises for\nj half-integer. For j integer, the end point is always j = \u22121. We will derive this embedding\ndiagram in more detail in the next sections. Similarly, for j < 0, the sub-module structure\nof the Wakimoto module Wj is as follows :\nVj \u2190\u2212 V\u2212j\u2212k\u22121 \u2190\u2212 Vj+k \u2190\u2212 . . . \u2190\u2212 V\u22121/2\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe analysis of the cohomology is exactly as in the appendix to [15] and we obtain the\nfollowing result for the cohomology. (We restrict ourselves to the only non-trivial j-values,\n\n8\n\n\fwhich are either half-integer or integer.) We get:\n1\nk\nFor j = \u2212 , . . . , \u22121, \u2212 :\n2\n2\n1\nFor j > \u2212 :\n2\nFor j < \u2212\n\nk\n:\n2\n\nH 1 (Wj ) = {j}\nH 1 (Wj ) = {j, j \u2212 k, . . . , k \u2212 j \u2212 1, \u2212j \u2212 1}\n\nand\n\nH 2 (Wj ) = {j \u2212 k, j \u2212 2k . . . k \u2212 j \u2212 1, \u2212j \u2212 1}\nH 1 (Wj ) = {\u2212j \u2212 k \u2212 1 . . . , j}\n\nand\n\nH 0 (Wj ) = {\u2212j \u2212 k \u2212 1, . . . , j + k}\n\n(3.6)\n\nFollowing the discussion in [37], we can infer from these spin values and the ghost number\nat which the cohomology arises, the values of the momentum of the auxiliary boson X, and\nwrite explicit cohomology representatives. It is easy to check that these coincide in the case\nat hand with the representatives constructed in [21]. It was also observed there that those\nrepresentatives are valid only for 2j + 1 \u2208 kZZ, i.e. the case to which we restricted above.\nIn the coming sections, we will see that these are only a subset of all possible cohomology\nelements, and we now turn to finding these elements. Moreover, we give many more details\nof the derivation of the cohomology, and the above case will be included as a special case.\n\n3.3\n\nGeneral Result for integer level\n\nIn this section, we give a proof by induction for the cohomology of the BRST operator Q\nin the Wakimoto modules for integer level k generalizing the examples worked out in the\nappendix (which can be consulted first by the reader prefering a warm-up).

Let us elaborate a bit more on how the\nspin j-values of the dots can be derived. For k integer, there is a simple way to generate\nall spins j appearing in the embedding at one go by using affine Weyl reflections about\nthe spin values j = \u2212 12 and j = \u2212 k+1\n2 . We generate the diagram above using affine Weyl\nreflections and show, by analyzing the Kac-Kazhdan equation, that the j-values generated\nindeed correspond to all singular vectors.\nBy using reflections around the points j = \u2212 12 and j = \u2212 k+1\n2 , we can reflect any halfinteger j spin into the range\n1\n(k + 1)\n\u2264 j0 \u2264 \u2212 .\n(3.8)\n\u2212\n2\n2\nwhere j0 denotes all possible end-points to an embedding diagram. First of all, we remark\nthat all j0 within this bound have a trivial embedding diagram, consisting of a single point\n(since there are no singular vectors as is easily checked from the Kac-Kazhdan equation).\nThe embedding diagrams for other j-values can be built up inductively by adding a pair of\n9\n\n\fdots at each step. The j-values of the successive dots are obtained by affine Weyl reflections\nabout the values j = \u2212 12 and j = \u2212 (k+1)\n2 . At the first level, this leads to the j values\n{\u2212j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 k \u2212 1}. Affine Weyl reflections on these dots lead to the pair {j0 \u2212 k, j0 + k},\n{\u2212j0 \u2212 1 + k, \u2212j0 \u2212 2k \u2212 1} and so on. Thus, reading the diagram backwards, the pairs follow\nthe pattern {\u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk, \u2212j0 \u2212 1 \u2212 (n + 1)k} followed by the pair {j0 \u2212 nk, j0 + nk} and so on\nrecursively. In this way, embedding diagrams for all half-integer j can be constructed, and the\nprecise labeling of the dots obtained. We exhibit the embedding diagram for j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk\nas an example.\n/ V\u2212j0 \u22121+(n\u22121)k\nVj0 +nk\n>>\n@\ny<\ny\n>\n>>\nyy\ny\n>>\nyy\n>>\nyy\n>>\n...\nVj E\n>>\nEE\n>\nEE\n>>\nEE\n>>\nEE\n>\u001e\n\"\n/\nVj0 \u2212nk\nV\u2212j0 \u22121\u2212nk\n\nVj0 +k\n\n/ V\u2212j0 \u22121\nB\nII\n88\nII\n\u0006\u0006\n88\nII\n\u0006\n88\n\u0006\nII\nI$\n88 \u0006\u0006\u0006\n8\n\u0006\n...\n8\n\u0006\nVj 0\n\u0006\u0006 888\nu:\nu\n\u0006\nu\n88\n\u0006\nuu\n\u0006\u0006\n88\nuu\n\u0006\nu\n\u0006\nu\n\u001c\n/ V\u2212j0 \u2212k\u22121\nVj0 \u2212k\n\n(3.9)\n\nWe note that the case 2j + 1 \u2208 kZ is a special case of the above, in which the double string\nembedding diagram collapses onto a single string embedding diagram. That special case was\ntreated in subsection 3.2.\nSingular vectors\nFrom the embedding diagram, it is clear that there are four cases of j-values to be considered\n(for n > 0)\n\u2022 j0 + nk : As mentioned earlier, singular vectors are solutions to the Kac-Kazhdan\nequation (3.2), i.e. pairs of integers (r, s) such that r + ks = 2j0 + 2nk + 1. Let us\ndiscuss the solution set in some detail: taking (r, s) = (2j0 + 2nk + 1, 0), we get the\nsingular vector labeled by j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1 \u2212 nk. Increasing s by one, we get the solution\n(r, s) = (2j0 + 1 + (2n \u2212 1)k, 1) leading to the singular vector j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)k.\nProceeding this way, we find all s values from 1 up to s = 2n \u2212 1, in which case\nwe obtain the singular vector corresponding to j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1 + (n \u2212 1)k. If we define\n+ = {j + xk, j + (x + 1)k, . . . , j + yk}, and S \u2212 = {\u2212j \u2212 1 + xk, \u2212j \u2212 1 + (x +\nSx,y\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nx,y\n\u2212\n1)k, . . . , \u2212j0 \u2212 1 + yk}, then the singular vectors corresponds to the list S\u2212n,n\u22121\n.\n\u2022 j0 \u2212 nk : A similar analysis leads to the set of singular vectors identical to the case\n\u2212\nabove, and we get the list of singular vectors S\u2212n,n\u22121\n.\n\u2022 \u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk : We now get singular vectors of the form j0 \u00b1 mk with 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n, which\n+\n.\ncorresponds to the list S\u2212n,n\n+\n. We have thus verified that the\n\u2022 \u2212j0 \u2212 1 \u2212 nk : We get the list of singular vectors S\u2212n,n\nembedding diagram of V\u2212j0 \u22121+nk indeed coincides with (3.9).\n\nProof by induction\nWe now claim that the cohomology of the Wakimoto module is given in terms of the singular\nvectors appearing in the module. We will give the details of the proof in the case j =\n\u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk. The other cases can be proven similarly. We will prove this claim by induction,\n10\n\n\fby assuming that the result holds for all m \u2264 n \u2212 1 and then show that the result also holds\nfor m = n. For j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk, the embedding diagram is shown in (3.9). In this case, the\nfollowing short exact sequences are valid:\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(V\u2212j0 \u22121+(n\u22121)k \u2295 V\u2212j0\u22121\u2212nk ) \u2212\u2192 Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk \u2212\u2192 Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk ) \u2212\u2192 0\n(3.10)\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk ) \u2212\u2192 V\u2212j0 \u22121+nk \u2212\u2192 I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere Ij refers to the irreducible module obtained by modding out the singular vectors in\nVj . The second sequence indicates that when we mod out by the leading singular vectors,\nthe Verma module becomes irreducible, while the first sequence quantifies the fact that in\nthat modding, we have double counted the submodules common to the two leading singular\nvectors. Now, we observe that in order to compute the cohomology using induction, we also\nneed to postulate the cohomology of the various images of direct sums of Verma modules in\nother Verma modules. We postulate the following ansatz for the Wakimoto modules\n+\n\u222a {\u2212j0 \u2212 1 \u00b1 mk}\nH 1 (W\u2212j0 \u22121\u00b1mk ) = S\u2212m,m\n\n+\nH 2 (W\u2212j0 \u22121+mk ) = H 0 (W\u2212j0 \u22121\u2212mk ) = S\u2212m,m\n\n\u2212\nH 1 (Wj0 \u00b1mk ) = S\u2212m,m\u22121\n\u222a {j0 \u00b1 mk}\n\n\u2212\nH 2 (Wj0 +mk ) = H 0 (Wj0 \u2212mk ) = S\u2212m,m\u22121\n\n(3.12)\n\nand introduce the following ansatz for the cohomology of the image modules\nH 1 (Im(V\u2212j0 \u22121+(n\u22121)k \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121\u2212nk )) = singular vectors in Vj0 \u00b1nk\n2\n\n\u2212\n= S\u2212n,n\u22121\n\n(3.13)\n\n+\n= S\u2212(n\u22121),(n\u22121)\n\n(3.14)\n\nH (Im(V\u2212j0 \u22121+(n\u22121)k \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121\u2212nk )) = singular vectors in V\u2212j0 \u22121+(n\u22121)k\n\nwhere in the right hand side of (3.14), we could have used V\u2212j0 \u22121\u2212nk as well. Our ansatz can\nbe explained as follows: the ghost number one cohomology H 1 of the image of the sum of\ntwo Verma modules Vj1 \u2295 Vj2 is given by the set of singular vectors in the Verma module Vj\nin which j1 and j2 are the leading singular vectors. Similarly, cohomology at ghost number\ntwo H 2 of the image is given by the singular vectors in either Vj1 or Vj2 , which coincide in\nall cases we consider. We will see that this ansatz generalizes to the rational level case also.\nWe now have all the ingredients to complete our proof by induction. Let us consider the\nshort exact sequence in (3.10). By the induction hypothesis, we know the cohomology of the\nfirst and middle element in the sequence. Considering the long exact sequence of cohomology,\nand using the induction hypothesis, the long exact sequence collapses to\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0 \u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\u22121\n\u222a {j0 \u2212 nk, j0 + nk} \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk )) \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 H 2 (Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk )) \u2212\u2192 0 (3.15)\n\u2212\u2192 S\u2212(n\u22121),n\u22121\n\nSolving for the cohomology, we get H 0 (Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk )) = 0,\n+\nH 1 (Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk )) = S\u2212n,n\n2\n\n= singular vectors in V\u2212j0 \u22121+nk\n\n(3.16)\n\n= singular vectors in Vj0 \u00b1nk\n\n(3.17)\n\nH (Im(Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk )) =\n\n\u2212\nS\u2212n,n\u22121\n\n11\n\n\fwhere in (3.16) and (3.17), we indicate that the result is what one would expect, given our\nansatz for the cohomology of the image modules in (3.13) and (3.14). We also find that the\ncohomology of the dual of the image is exactly the same as this one, with the exchange of\nghost number zero H 0 and ghost number two H 2 cohomology. Let us now consider the short\nexact sequence dual to (3.11):\n\u2217\n0 \u2212\u2192 I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk \u2212\u2192 V\u2212j\n\u2212\u2192 Im\u2217 (Vj0 +nk \u2295 Vj0 \u2212nk ) \u2192 0\n0 \u22121+nk\n\n(3.18)\n\nNote that although we have taken the dual sequence, the irreducible module has remained unchanged, since it is canonically isomorphic to its dual. The long exact sequence corresponding\nto (3.18) now takes the form\n\u2212\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 0 (I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 H 1 (I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) \u2212\u2192\n\n+\n\u2212\u2192 H 2 (I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) \u2212\u2192 0 (3.19)\n\u2212\u2192 {\u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk} \u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\n\nwhich leads to\n\u2212\nH 1 (I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) = S\u2212n,n\n\n+\n.\nH 2 (I\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) = S\u2212n,n\n\n(3.20)\n\nWe now input all these results into the long exact sequence corresponding to the short sequence (3.11), and consequently it collapses to the following short sequence\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192 H 1 (V\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) \u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\n0 \u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\n\n+\n\u2212\u2192 0 (3.21)\n\u2212\u2192 H 2 (V\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) \u2212\u2192 S\u2212n,n\n\nThus, we finally get the non-zero cohomologies\n+\n\u222a {\u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk}\nH 1 (W\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) = S\u2212n,n\n\n+\nH 2 (W\u2212j0 \u22121+nk ) = S\u2212n,n\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhich agrees with the ansatz in (3.12) for m = n. Thus, we have proved the induction\nhypothesis for one case j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1 + nk, and all other cases can be computed similarly. Note\nthat we have also proven that the cohomologies localize on singular vectors (and precisely\nhow) in the case of integer level and for any spin. We now turn to the most intricate case of\nfractional level k.\n\n3.4\n\nThe cohomology for positive rational level\n\nWe consider the fractional level k = pq , where p, q are mutually prime strictly positive integers.\nWe already argued that this is going to be the most non-trivial case, since two or more\nsingular vectors in a given Verma module imply that k is fractional. Moreover, we note that\nfor fractional k, solutions to the Kac-Kazhdan equations will only occur for the set of spins\n1\n. We therefore from now on restrict to this non-trivial subset (since\nthat are multiples of 2q\nall other cases can be treated more straightforwardly).\n\n12\n\n\fEmbedding diagrams\nFor this case as well, we can algorithmically construct the embedding diagrams for all Verma\nmodules, using the results of Malikov [34] (see also [35]). The diagrams have the same\n\"double-string\" shape as before, but are now generated by \u03c1-centered affine Weyl reflections\nthat depend on the particular spin under study. We discuss in detail in the appendix A\nhow these embedding diagrams are constructed. Although this is the most systematic and\nall-at-once procedure, below, we will follow a more pedestrian route. We will reconstruct the\nembedding diagrams inductively simply by locating the singular vectors in a given module.\nAlthough this approach may be more accessible and constructive, its a posteriori justification\nlies in its agreement with the proof for the embedding diagram given in [34].\nThe cohomology for a simple case\nTo compute the cohomology, we follow an inductive procedure. First of all, when 2j + 1 is\nnot of the form\n2j + 1 = r + ks\n\nsuch that\n\nrs > 0 or\n\nr > 0, s = 0 ,\n\n(3.23)\n\nthen the module has no singular vectors and is irreducible. We have then that the Verma\nmodule is equivalent to its dual, and is equivalent to the Wakimoto module and its dual.\nThis is because for irreducible Verma modules, there exists a non-degenerate Shapolov form\nwhich can be used to construct a canonical isomorphism between the Verma module and its\ndual. This also implies that the cohomology of an irreducible module is the same as that\nof its dual. Thus all these modules have cohomology H n (Vj = Wj = Wj\u2217 ) = \u03b41,n {j}. This\ncompletes the calculation of the cohomology in the case of irreducible modules.\nThe cohomology in the case of one singular vector\nNext, we move on to the case where the Verma module Vj1 under consideration has precisely\none singular vector. The values of j1 for which this is the case can be parameterized by the\ncorresponding values of (r1 , s1 ), which are related to j1 by\n2j1 + 1 = r1 + ks1 .\n\n(3.24)\n\nWhen 2j1 +1 is positive, the couple (r1 , s1 ) satisfies r1 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p} and s1 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , q\u22121}.\nWhen 2j1 + 1 is negative, we have that r1 \u2208 {\u22121, \u22122, . . . , \u2212p} and s1 \u2208 {\u22121, \u22122, . . . , \u2212q}.\nWe have thus 2.p.q values of j1 with precisely one singular vector.\n(1)\n(1)\nThe singular vectors are at values of the spin j1 which are given by 2j1 + 1 = 2j1 + 1 \u2212\n2r1 = \u2212r1 + ks1 . (Note that this expression can be of either sign.) It is now not too difficult\nto prove that none of the Verma modules associated to the singular vectors can have any\nsingular vectors themselves. Thus, they are irreducible, and we have already computed their\ncohomology. We can then proceed to compute the cohomology for the case of one singular\nvector. We have the exact sequences:\n0 \u2212\u2192 Vj (1) \u2212\u2192 Vj1 \u2212\u2192 Ij1 \u2212\u2192 0\n1\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Ij1 \u2212\u2192 Vj\u22171 \u2212\u2192 Vj (1) \u2212\u2192 0 .\n1\n\nThe first sequence indicates that modding out by the single singular vector gives an irreducible\nmodule, while the second follows by dualizing and from the fact that the modules Ij1 and\n13\n\n\fVj (1) are irreducible. Suppose that j1 is positive; then Vj1 = Wj1 . Then we first use the\n1\nsecond exact sequence to compute the cohomology of Ij1 :\n(1)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Ij1 ) \u2212\u2192 {j1 } \u2212\u2192 {j1 } \u2212\u2192 H 2 (Ij1 ) \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n(3.25)\n\nWe thus have that\n(1)\n\nH 1 (Ij1 ) = {j1 }\n\nH 2 (Ij1 ) = {j1 }.\n\n(3.26)\n\nWe can feed this information into the first exact sequence and we obtain:\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 {j1 } \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Wj1 ) \u2212\u2192 {j1 } \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 H 2 (Wj1 ) \u2212\u2192 {j1 } \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhich gives us the result:\n(1)\n\nH 1 (Wj1 ) = {j1 } \u222a {j1 }\n\n(1)\n\nH 2 (Wj1 ) = {j1 } .\n\n(3.28)\n\nThese are the set of the parent spin and the singular vector, and the singular vector respectively.\nFor j1 negative, we have that the Verma module is equivalent to the dual Wakimoto\nmodule, and repeating the analysis above, we find that\n(1)\n\nH 1 (Wj1 ) = {j1 } \u222a {j1 }\n\n(1)\n\nH 0 (Wj1 ) = {j1 } .\n\n(3.29)\n\nThus we have computed the cohomologies for all modules with a single singular vector.\nThe location of singular vectors in Verma modules\nWe now turn to a classification of the cases where the parent module has precisely n singular\nvectors. It is not too difficult to see that these cases are described as follows. Define the spin\njn to be given by:\n2jn + 1 = rn + ksn .\n(3.30)\nFor positive spin, we have that jn lies in the set corresponding to rn \u2208 {(n \u2212 1)p + 1, (n \u2212\n1)p + 2, . . . , np} and sn \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1}. When 2jn + 1 is negative, we have that rn \u2208\n{\u2212(n \u2212 1)p \u2212 1, \u2212(n \u2212 1)p \u2212 2, . . . , \u2212np} and sn \u2208 {\u22121, \u22122, . . . , \u2212q}. We thus always have\n2.p.q values of jn with precisely n singular vectors. In the case of positive spin, which will\ntake to be the case for our calculations, we have that the singular vectors correspond to the\npairs (r, s) \u2208 {(rn , sn ), (rn \u2212 p, sn + q), . . . , (rn \u2212 (n \u2212 1)p, sn + (n \u2212 1)q)}.\nWe also have a claim that we will treat in more detail. Suppose we consider the module\nVjn , and label the leading singular vectors in them as Vj (1) and Vj (n) 5 . Now list the singular\nn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\nvectors in these modules. We will find below that these are in fact, the same list of vectors.\nOnce again, consider the leading singular vectors in this list of n \u2212 1 singular vectors, and\n(1,n\u22121)\n(1,1)\nlabel them Vjn\u22122 and Vjn\u22122 . Consider the singular vectors in these modules; we claim\n(and prove below) that the singular vectors in either of these modules make up the remaining\nn \u2212 2 singular vectors in the original module Vjn . This is key to writing down short exact\nsequences of Verma modules that will lead to computing cohomology.\n5\n\nThe notation is such that the subscript tells us the number of singular vectors in a given module, while\nthe superscripts keeps track of its line of descent from Vjn .\n\n14\n\n\fLet's prove these claims, and start with a spin jn module, associated to a module with\nn singular vectors. We have that 2jn + 1 = rn + ksn where (rn , sn ) are taken in the set\ndescribed above (and we take them to be positive for simplicity). The resulting spins of the\nmodules of the singular vectors are (ln = 1, 2, . . . , n):\n(l )\n\nn\n2jn\u22121\n+ 1 = \u2212rn + ksn + 2(ln \u2212 1)p.\n\n(3.31)\n\nIn particular, we have the spins which we believe to be the nearest to jn in the embedding\ndiagram of Vjn , namely those associated to ln = 1, n:\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n2jn\u22121 + 1 = \u2212rn + ksn = rn\u22121 + ksn\u22121\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n2jn\u22121 + 1 = \u2212rn + ksn + 2(n \u2212 1)p = rn\u22121 + ksn\u22121 .\n\n(3.32)\n\nIn the case of integer level, these appeared at an equal distance from jn but in the rational\nlevel, this need not be the case. Modules associated to each of these j values have n \u2212 1\n(n)\n(n)\n(1)\n(1)\nsingular vectors. Indeed, the associated pairs (rn\u22121 , sn\u22121 ) and (rn\u22121 , sn\u22121 ) are given by the\nformulae\n(1)\n\nrn\u22121 = p \u2212 rn \u2208 {\u2212(n \u2212 2)p, . . . , \u2212(n \u2212 1)p}\n(1)\n\nsn\u22121 = sn \u2212 q \u2208 {\u2212q, . . . , \u22121}\n(n)\n\nrn\u22121 = 2(n \u2212 1)p \u2212 rn \u2208 {(n \u2212 2)p, . . . , (n \u2212 1)p}\n(n)\n\nsn\u22121 = sn \u2208 {1, . . . , q} .\n\n(3.33)\n\nTheir ranges have been explicitly shown to make it clear that they indeed have n \u2212 1 singular\nvectors each. Let us now list the set of singular vectors in each of the modules Vj (1) and\nn\u22121\n\n(n)\n\n(1)\n\n)\n(1,l\njn\u22122n\u22121\n\nVj (n) .

The calculation of the cohomology is then\neasily adapted from the appendix to [15] and our subsection on the linear case for integer k.\n\n16\n\n\fThe knowledge of the embedding diagram allows us to write down the exact sequences:\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(Vj (1) \u2295 Vj (n\u22121) ) \u2212\u2192 Vj (1) \u2295 Vj (n)\nn\u22122\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\u22122\n\n\u2212\u2192 Im(Vj (1) \u2295 Vj (n) ) \u2212\u2192 0 (3.42)\nn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(Vj (1) \u2295 Vj (n) ) \u2212\u2192 Vjn \u2212\u2192 Ijn \u2212\u2192 0\nn\u22121\n\n(3.43)\n\nn\u22121\n\nThe second sequence codes the irreducibility of the module obtained by modding out by the\nleading singular vectors, while the first one encodes the double counting in this modding\nout. From here on, the proof for the cohomology of the BRST operator Q is identical to the\ninteger level case and we once again find that cohomology elements are given by the singular\nvectors. As for the integer level case, we need to postulate not only the cohomology of the\nWakimoto modules but also those of the image modules appearing in (3.42).

This is our answer for the cohomology of Wakimoto\nmodules and thus the complete set of topological observables for the level k = pq twisted\nSL(2, IR)/U (1) model.\n\n3.5\n\nAlternative proofs\n\nAn alternative inductive proof for the cohomology of the Wakimoto modules is possible,\nbased on another pair of short exact sequences7 . Again, for simplicity only, we restrict to\nthe case of positive 2jn + 1 = rn + ksn . The induction hypothesis consists of the validity of\nthe cohomology that we found above for modules with less than n singular vectors in (3.44),\nand, of the cohomology of the corresponding irreducible modules. (The latter cohomology\ndepends on the sign of the spin.) Now, we can construct a first short exact sequence by\nmodding out the Verma module of spin jn by one of its two leading singular vectors, say\n(1)\njn\u22121 , to produce a new module Xn :\n0 \u2192 Vj (1) \u2192 Vjn \u2192 Xn \u2192 0\nn\u22121\n\n0 \u2192 Ij (n) \u2192 Xn \u2192 Ijn \u2192 0.\n\n(3.52)\n\nn\u22121\n\nWe then used the module Xn in a second sequence which says that after eliminating the\n(n)\nfurther singular vector jn\u22121 (and none of its descendants since they have already been modded\nout), we obtain an irreducible module. Using these two short exact sequences and their duals\nit is not hard to show that the induction step can be proven (both on the cohomology of\nthe irreducible module and on the cohomology of the Wakimoto modules). For the reader's\n7\n\nWe would like to thank Edward Frenkel for indicating to us the idea behind this alternative proof.\n\n18\n\n\fconvenience we record an intermediate result, namely the cohomology of the modules Xn (for\njn positive):\n(1)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\nH 1 (Xn ) = {jn } \u222a {jn\u22122 , . . . , jn\u22122 }\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\nH 2 (Xn ) = {jn\u22121 } \u222a {jn\u22122 , . . . , jn\u22122 } .\n\n(3.53)\n\nFurthermore, from the first alternative proof follows a second. We could choose to mod out\nfirst by the other leading singular vector. We obtain the short exact sequences:\n0 \u2192 Vj (n) \u2192 Vjn \u2192 Yn \u2192 0\nn\u22121\n\n0 \u2192 Ij (1) \u2192 Xn \u2192 Ijn \u2192 0.\n\n(3.54)\n\nn\u22121\n\nThe proof follows familiar lines. We quote the intermediate result for the cohomology of the\nnew modules Yn :\n(1)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\nH 0 (Yn ) = {jn\u22122 , . . . , jn\u22122 }\n(1)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\n(1)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\nH 1 (Yn ) = {jn } \u222a {jn\u22121 , . . . , jn\u22121 } \u222a {jn\u22122 , . . . , jn\u22122 }\n(1)\n\n(n)\n\nH 2 (Yn ) = {jn\u22121 , . . . , jn\u22121 }.\n\n(3.55)\n\nNote that these modules have cohomology at three different ghost numbers.8\n\n4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOur main result is that the cohomology of the topologically twisted coset theory is given\nin terms of the singular vectors of the Wakimoto modules constructed over the SL(2, IR)\ncurrent algebra. The precise form in which this is realized can be seen in equation (3.44).\nWe conclude by making a few remarks on further avenues to explore, and on the uses of the\nrather technical results we have obtained regarding the topological observables of the cigar.\n\u2022 It is possible to give explicit representatives of the cohomology, using the formulae\nobtained for singular vectors in SL(2, IR) modules [38][39]. Following the analysis in\n[15], rewriting these cohomology elements in Wakimoto variables could be very useful\nin establishing the relation between twisted cosets and bosonic string theories.\n\u2022 It would be instructive to further analyze, as was done in [37] for the particular case\nof the topological cigar at level k = 1 (i.e. the conifold), how the operation of spectral\nflow acts on the observables of the topological cigar.\n\u2022 The relationship between the statement that the cohomology localizes on singular\nvectors and the statement [20] that N = 2 topological singular vectors always arise\n(through the Kazama-Suzuki map) from SL(2, IR) singular vectors are tantalizingly\nclose. It is fairly clear that clarifying the details of the relation will also illuminate the\nrole of spectral flow.\n8\n\nAlgebraically, it is intuitive that the two leading singular vectors give rise to proofs with slightly different\nstructure, since only one of the two leading singular spins is related to the parent spin by an elementary Weyl\nreflection, as defined and discussed in the appendix A.\n\n19\n\n\f\u2022 An important application we have in mind for these results is in the context of the\nN = 2 topological string (see e.g. [40] for a review). Now that we obtained the\nobservables on the topological cigar, the algorithm to obtain the closed string spectrum\nof topological strings on non-compact Gepner models consisting of (twisted) N = 2\nminimal models and topological cigars is clear. Indeed, the chiral cohomology on the\nN = 2 minimal models is straightforward to compute, and is well-known. (When\nworking with a unitary spectrum, the powerful results of [41] make the calculation\nmuch easier.) Furthermore, one could then combine left- and right-movers to form\na consistent spectrum, following Gepner's technique of GSO projecting onto integer\nU (1)R charges. In the present context, the GSO projection will boil down to a simple\norbifold by an abelian group that will depend only on the levels involved in the noncompact Gepner model. (This is clear from the form of the N = 2 U (1)R current in\nthese models and is for instance discussed in [9][10][11][12][13], following Gepner.) It\nwill then be very interesting to combine these observations together with the fact that\nthe N = 2 topological string basically corresponds to a bosonic string theory (see e.g.\n[40]). This would be a worldsheet approach to isolate integrable subsectors of string\ntheories on (non-compact) Calabi-Yau manifolds [42].\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Wendy Lowen for helpful correspondence and to Edward Frenkel for\ninsightful comments on these problems and on the appendix to [15].

In this appendix, we briefly review some of the mathematics involved in understanding the embedding diagrams. We hope this will make the relevant mathematics\nliterature more readable to the interested physicist.\nWe introduce some notation and refer to standard text books on affine algebras for further\ninformation on the following standard concepts. We introduce the algebra sl2 , where the\nnotation is meant to indicate that we consider the algebra over the complex numbers. We\nfollow (in this appendix only) su(2) conventions for the structure constants and metric of the\ncorresponding affine algebra (see e.g. [43] for standard conventions). The affine algebra has\nsimple positive roots \u03b11 (the simple positive root of the ordinary, horizontal su(2) subalgebra)\nand \u03b10 = \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b11 , where \u03b4 is the imaginary root. We take the algebra to be at (bosonic) level\nksu(2) .\nWe can define \u03c1-centered affine Weyl reflections (where \u03c1 is defined in the usual way, as\nhaving inner product equal to one with all positive simple roots). These \u03c1-centered affine\nWeyl reflections s\u03c1\u03b1 with respect to the root \u03b1 are given in terms of the affine Weyl reflections\n\n20\n\n\fs\u03b1 by the formula:\n2(\u03b1, \u03bb\u0302)\n(\u03b1, \u03b1)\n\u03c1\ns\u03b1 (\u03bb) = s\u03b1 (\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1.\ns\u03b1 \u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb\u0302 \u2212\n\n(A.1)\n\nWe will mostly refer only to the action of the \u03c1-centered affine Weyl reflections on the part of\nthe weight that lies in the direction of the horizontal su(2) subalgebra of the full Kac-Moody\nalgebra (i.e. the standard spin of the base representation). On the spin j of a representation\n(corresponding to a horizontal weight \u03bb1 = j\u03b11 , these Weyl reflections act as follows:\ns\u03c1\u03b11 +l\u03b4 (j) = \u2212l(ksu(2) + 2) \u2212 j \u2212 1\n\ns\u03c1\u2212\u03b11 +l\u03b4 (j) = l(ksu(2) + 2) \u2212 j \u2212 1.\n\n(A.2)\n\nFollowing [34] we also define an operation S on the spin and the level of the affine algebra\nwhich acts as (j, ksu(2) ) 7\u2192 (\u2212j \u2212 1, \u2212ksu(2) \u2212 4).\n\nA.1\n\nFlipping\n\nThe statements on the structure of the embedding of Verma modules derived in [34], and\nrestricted to the case of relevance here, can now be made more transparent, using the above\nnotations.\nFirst of all, the main theorem on the embedding structure in [34], in paragraph 2, case\nA, pertains to the case where the level of the sl2 algebra, which we have named ksu(2) is\nlarger than \u22122. However, the case of interest to us in the bulk can be reduced to this case\nvia the operation S. Indeed, consider a spin and bosonic su(2) level (jn , \u2212k \u2212 2) as in the\nbulk of our paper. (Note that ksu(2) = \u2212k \u2212 2, where k is the supersymmetric SL(2, R) level\nused in the bulk of the paper.) By acting with the operation S, we find the spin and level\n(\u2212jn \u2212 1, k \u2212 2). Since our supersymmetric level k is larger than zero, we do find that the\nnew bosonic level k \u2212 2 is larger than \u22122, and that we now therefore fall into the framework\nof the embedding diagrams discussed in paragraph 2, case A of [34].\n\nA.2\n\nConstructing the embedding diagram\n\nThe results of Malikov [34] then permit us to construct the embedding diagrams for all cases.\nIn particular, we concentrate on the most difficult case of k = p/q fractional (with p, q both\nstrictly positive mutually prime integers). First note that the Kaz-Kazhdan equation can be\nwritten more invariantly as being satisfied for an affine weight \u03bb when:\n2(\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1) = m(\u03b1, \u03b1)\n\n(A.3)\n\nfor some positive root \u03b1 and m \u2208 N0 (i.e. m a strictly positive integer). This translates\ndirectly into the equation used in the bulk of the paper. However, following [34], we will now\nconsider solutions to this equation for m any integer. In other words, we will study solutions\nto the equation:\n\u22122jn \u2212 1 = \u2212m \u2212 kn\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhich is the Kaz-Kazhdan equation for the flipped spin defined above, and with respect to\nthe flipped supersymmetric level k, and this for any integers m and n. Pick now the smallest\n21\n\n\fpositive integer n such that the equation is satisfied, and the smallest strictly negative integer\nn such that the equation holds. For the values jn defined in the bulk of the paper, in equation\n(3.30), it is not hard to see that these values correspond to sn , sn \u2212 q and sn + q, sn for jn\npositive and negative respectively. These, via the Kac-Kazhdan equations above correspond\nto positive affine roots which are, for 2jn + 1 positive:\n\u03b11 + sn \u03b4\n\u2212\u03b11 + (q \u2212 sn )\u03b4\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhile for 2jn + 1 negative, we consider the positive roots:\n\u03b11 + (q + sn )\u03b4\n\u2212\u03b11 \u2212 sn \u03b4.\n\n(A.6)\n\nThe results of [34] show that the embedding diagrams of the Verma module with spin j\ncan be constructed from an initial Verma module j0 by \u03c1-centered Weyl-reflecting from this\ninitial point, and adding a node to the embedding diagram for each step on the way to the\ndestination j. The node j0 corresponds to the unique spin satisfying the equations:\n0 \u2264 \u22122j0 \u2212 1 + sn k \u2264 p\n\n(A.7)\n\n0 \u2264 2j0 + 1 \u2212 sn k \u2264 p,\n\n(A.8)\n\nrespectively\n\nand lying in the orbit of j under the above \u03c1-centered Weyl reflections.\nSince this prescription is rather abstract (although already more concrete than the original\none [34]), let us first illustrate this in the case where the level k is integer, and see how we\nrecuperate the diagrams used in the bulk of the paper.\nThe case of k integer\nFor k integer, we have that q = 1, and that for 2jn + 1 positive, say, we have that sn = 0.\nConsequently, the allowed \u03c1-centered Weyl reflections are those with respect to \u03b11 and \u03b11 +\u03b4.\nThese are the standard \u03c1-centered Weyl reflections, and those are precisely the ones we used\nto construct the diagrams in the case of integer level. Moreover, the condition on the final\nspin becomes 0 \u2264 \u22122j0 \u2212 1 \u2264 k = p which is precisely what we found in the bulk of the\npaper.\nThe general case\nIn the general case too, one can show with a bit more tedious but straightforward calculations\nthat the above systematic construction of the embedding diagrams agrees on the nose with\nthe analysis in terms of singular vectors only performed in the bulk of the paper. In fact,\nthis justifies the approach in the bulk of the paper, via the detailed proof of Malikov of the\nembedding structure of all Verma modules for the affine sl2 algebra.\n\n22\n\n\fB\n\nA case study\n\nAs we have seen, for j-values that are not of the form 2j + 1 \u2208 kZZ, the sub-module structure\nis not linear. The simplest example of a non-linear embedding of sub-modules occurs when\nthe embedding diagram has only four entries (the \"rhombus\" diagram). From the general\nembedding diagram (3.9) for integer k, we see that this happens for j = j0 \u00b1 k. Let us discuss\neach of these cases in turn and demonstrate explicitly how one would compute cohomology\ninductively.\n\nB.1\n\nThe case j = j0 + k\n\nFor j > \u2212 12 , the Wakimoto modules are isomorphic to the Verma modules and we can read\noff the submodule structure from [34] to be (with Wj = Vj )\nV\n\n9 \u2212j0 \u22121II\nss\nII\ns\ns\nII\nss\nII\ns\nI$\nss\nV\nVj0 +k\n: j0\nKK\nuu\nKK\nu\nKK\nuu\nKK\nuu\nK%\nuu\n\n(B.1)\n\nV\u2212j0 \u2212k\u22121\n\nIn order to find the cohomology of Q in this module Wj , we have to first find the cohomology\nof the modules W\u2212j0 \u22121 and W\u2212j0 \u2212k\u22121 . However, these have linear sub-module structure and\ntheir cohomology can be computed using the techniques of Frenkel in [15]. Let us illustrate\nthis in the case of W\u2212j0 \u22121 = V\u2212j0 \u22121 , which has the embedding structure\nV\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2212\u2192 Vj0 .\n\n(B.2)\n\nNow, it follows that the following sequence of modules is a short exact sequence :\n\u2217\n0 \u2212\u2192 I\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2212\u2192 W\u2212j\n\u2212\u2192 Wj0 \u2212\u2192 0 .\n0 \u22121\n\n(B.3)\n\nSo far we have only focused on the modules over the SL(2, IR) current algebra. In order\nto compute the cohomology of the Q operator in (2.16), we have to tensor the SL(2, IR)\nmodules with the Fock modules over the (b, c) and X algebra. Although we will suppress\nthese tensor products while writing out the sequences of modules, it is good to keep in mind\nthat the states (observables) we will find as cohomology elements belong to the Hilbert space\nin (2.12).\nThe corresponding long exact sequence of cohomology is given by\n\u2217\n. . . \u2212\u2192 H q (I\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 H q (W\u2212j\n) \u2212\u2192 H q (Wj0 ) \u2212\u2192 H q+1 (I\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 . . .\n0 \u22121\n\n(B.4)\n\nUsing (3.1) and (3.6), our long exact sequence collapses to the following short exact sequences\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (I\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 {\u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 0\n0 \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192 H 2 (I\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(B.5)\n\nall other cohomology groups being trivial. We thus get H 1 (I\u2212j0 \u22121 ) = {\u2212j0 \u2212 1} and\nH 2 (I\u2212j0 \u22121 ) = {j0 }. Now consider the short exact sequence dual to the one considered above\n0 \u2212\u2192 Wj\u22170 \u2212\u2192 W\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2212\u2192 I\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2212\u2192 0 .\n23\n\n(B.6)\n\n\fOnce again, considering the corresponding long exact sequence and using the results derived\nso far, we get the collapsed short exact sequences for the cohomology\n0 \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192 H 1 (W\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 {\u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 0\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (W\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(B.7)\n\nSimilar manipulations can be done for j = \u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1 and we get the following result for\nthe cohomology :\nFor j = \u2212j0 \u2212 1,\nFor j = \u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1,\n\nH 1 (W\u2212j0 \u22121 ) = {\u2212j0 \u2212 1, j0 }\nH 2 (W\u2212j0 \u22121 ) = {j0 }\n\nH 1 (W\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 ) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, j0 }\nH 0 (W\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 ) = {j0 }\n\n(B.8)\n\nWe now have the ingredients necessary to compute the cohomology of Wj0 +k whose submodule\nstructure is shown in (B.1). We claim that the following sequences are exact\n0 \u2212\u2192 Ij0 \u2212\u2192 V\u2212k\u2212j0\u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2212\u2192 Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0\u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 0\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 Vj0 +k \u2212\u2192 Ij0 +k \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(B.9)\n(B.10)\n\nIn all, there are four unknown cohomologies, those of the modules Vj0 +k , Ij0 +k , and the\ncohomology of the image module that appears in sequence (B.9) and its dual. Using these\ntwo short exact sequences and their dual sequences, it is possible to compute the cohomology\nof all four modules.\nWe first solve for the cohomology of Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0\u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ). Using the fact that\n\u2217\nV\u2212j0 \u2212k\u22121 = W\u2212j\n0 \u2212k\u22121\n\nand V\u2212j0 \u22121 = W\u2212j0 \u22121 ,\n\n(B.11)\n\nthe long exact sequence corresponding to the short exact sequence in (B.9) collapses to\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 0 (Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 )) \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1, j0 } \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192 H 1 (Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 )) \u2212\u2192 0 (B.12)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192 H 2 (Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 )) \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(B.13)\n\nThis leads to\nH 1 (Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 )) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1}\nH 2 (Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 )) = {j0 } .\n\n(B.14)\n\nLet us now consider the sequence dual to (B.9). Using similar techniques, we find that the\ndual of the image module has the same cohomology, with H 0 replaced by H 2 . Let us now\napply these results to the dual of the exact sequence in (B.10):\n0 \u2212\u2192 Ij0 +k \u2212\u2192 Vj\u22170 +k \u2212\u2192 Im\u2217 (V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n(B.15)\n\nSince, Vj=j0+k = Wj0 +k , the corresponding long exact sequence collapses to\n0 \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Ij0 +k ) \u2212\u2192 {j0 + k} \u2212\u2192 0\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 H 2 (Ij0 +k ) \u2212\u2192 0\n24\n\n(B.16)\n\n\ffrom which we get H 1 (Ij0 +k ) = {j0 , j0 + k} and H 2 (Ij0 +k ) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1}. Now,\nwriting out the long exact sequence corresponding to the short exact sequence in (B.10) and\nusing all the results obtained so far, we get the following non-trivial long exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Wj0 +k ) \u2212\u2192 {j0 , j0 + k} \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192 H 2 (Wj0 +k ) \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 0 (B.17)\n\nThe long sequence breaks as shown in the equation into two subsequences, which can be\nsolved to obtain\nH 1 (Wj0 +k ) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1, j0 + k}\n\nH 2 (Wj0 +k ) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1}\n\nB.2\n\n(B.18)\n\nThe case j = j0 \u2212 k\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this section, there is another value of j for which the submodule structure is the same as in (B.1), j = j0 \u2212 k < 0. However, since for negative j,\nWakimoto modules are isomorphic to dual Verma modules [15], the directions in the arrows\nof the embedding diagram for the Wakimoto module are opposite to what was considered\nearlier (since Wj0 \u2212k = Vj\u22170 \u2212k ):\n\u2217\nV\u2212j\n0 \u22121\n\nVj\u22170 \u2212k\n\nt\ntt\ntt\nt\nt\ntz t\n\ncHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nH\n\ndJJ\nJJ\nJJ\nJJ\nJ\n\nvv\nvv\nv\nvv\nv{ v\n\n(B.19)\n\nVj\u22170\n\n\u2217\nV\u2212k\u2212j\n0 \u22121\n\nSince this case is different from the j > 0 case, let us go through the exercise of computing\ncohomology explicitly. The short exact sequences in (B.9) and (B.10) remain the same, with\nj0 +k replaced by j0 \u2212k. However, when writing out the long exact sequence of cohomologies,\nit is important to use the equality Vj0 \u2212k = Wj\u22170 \u2212k . With this in mind, let us proceed as before.\nThe computation of the cohomology of Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ) using the sequence in\n(B.10) remains unchanged. We are thus left with the sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im(V\u2212k\u2212j0\u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 Wj\u22170 \u2212k \u2212\u2192 Ij0 \u2212k \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n(B.20)\n\nThe corresponding long exact sequence breaks up into\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 0 (Ij0 \u2212k ) \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 0\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 {j0 \u2212 k} \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Ij0 \u2212k ) \u2212\u2192 {j0 , \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(B.21)\n\nleading to H 0 (Ij0 \u2212k ) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} and H 1 (Ij0 \u2212k ) = {j0 \u2212 k, j0 }. Consider now\nthe sequence dual to (B.20)\n0 \u2212\u2192 Ij0 \u2212k \u2212\u2192 Wj0 \u2212k \u2212\u2192 Im\u2217 (V\u2212k\u2212j0 \u22121 \u2295 V\u2212j0 \u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n25\n\n(B.22)\n\n\fThe long exact sequence is of the form\n0 \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 H 0 (Wj0 \u2212k ) \u2212\u2192 {j0 } \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192 {j0 , j0 \u2212 k} \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Wj0 \u2212k ) \u2212\u2192 {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1} \u2212\u2192 0 (B.23)\n\nwhich breaks into two shorter sequences (as indicated in the diagram). Solving for the\ncohomology groups, we get\nH 1 (Wj0 \u2212k ) = {j0 \u2212 k, \u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1}\n\nH 0 (Wj0 \u2212k ) = {\u2212k \u2212 j0 \u2212 1, \u2212j0 \u2212 1}\n\n(B.24)\n\nThe notable feature of this analysis is the following :\n\u2022 The spin j-values of the cohomology elements correspond to the singular vectors that\nappear in the original module. For both j = j0 \u00b1 k, the module generated by j = j0\nis not a submodule (i.e. j0 not a singular vector within the original module). This can\nbe explicitly checked by finding solutions to the Kac-Kazhdan equation in (3.2).\nThis feature generalizes to the generic case with more nodes and also to the rational case, and\nhas inspired our ansatz in (3.44) which we have proven in the main text using the method of\ninduction.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
