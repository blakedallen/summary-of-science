This seems to suggest that the little d-discs\noperad (or equivalently the notion of a d-algebra) gives a new way to\nunderstand the mathematical aspects of quantum gravity using holography. The strategy is as follows: we would like to learn something\nabout quantum gravity in (d + 1) dimensions: we use holography to\nreduce our original problem to a CFT in d-dimensions. The deep origin\nof this dimensional reduction lies on the fact that it is the area and\nnot the volume which appears in the formula giving the entropy of\nblack holes as described long ago by Hawking. Then we use d-algebras\n(i.e. the little d-discs operad) to study our d-dim CFT. The possible\nrelation between d-dim CFT and d-algebras comes from the lesson we\nhave learnt from strings (namely the 2-dim CFT case): the space of\nphysical states in closed string field theory (ie the BRST cohomology)\nhas a natural Gerstenhaber algebra structure and this by Cohen's theorem is related to the little 2-discs operad.

't Hooft [2] in Physics might be related to the Higher\nDimensional Deligne Conjecture in Mathematics due to Kontsevich. In 2000\nKontsevich and Soibelman [8] proved the original Deligne conjecture. A secong proof was given by Tamarkin (see [9]). Very recently yet another proof\nof the Deligne conjecture appeared which is due to A. Kohlhuber using the\narc operad.\nLet us roughly explain both these statements here and elaborate more\non them later: Holography is a statement about quantum gravity; in simple\nterms it says that quantum gravity must be a topological quantum field\ntheory.\nOn the other hand the original Deligne conjecture (due to Deligne as the\nname suggests, see [3]), it is about the Hochschild complex of associative\nalgebras; as it is well-known the Hochschild complex is very useful when one\nwants to study the theory of deformations of algebras.\nWe organise this article as follows: in section 2 we try to explain the\nnecessity for holography in physics starting from black hole puzzles; in section 3 we give the necessary mathematical definitions about operads and\nGerstenhaber algebras and we also state the two basic theorems: the first\nis due to F. Cohen and relates Gerstenhaber algebras with the little 2-discs\noperad and the second is D. Tamarkin's theorem on the formality of the little d-discs operad. In the last section we explain the relation between string\ntheory and the little 2-discs operad. Then as we shall see, one will be able\nto interpret Kontsevich's statement as a higher dimensional analogue of the\nabove relation.\n2\n\n\fWe start our discussion with possibly the most mysterious objects in the\nuniverse: Black Holes.\n\n2\n\nUnderstanding Black Holes from Strings: the\nneed for a nonlocality mechanism\n\nWe have gained some understanding on two important problems in black\nhole physics (abreviated to \"BH\" in the sequel) by using some recent results\nfrom string theory dualities (for more details one can see [1] which is a nice\nreview article):\n1. In general relativity we have the so-called \"no hair\" theorem which\nrefers to black holes. This is the statement that the configuration of a black\nhole solution given by the Schwarzchild metric is uniquely determined by its\nmass (= total energy) (we assume no more conserved quantities like electric\ncharge or angular momentum for simplicity). In other words we have only\none configuration (for a given mass) associated to the Schwarzchild solution.\nFollowing the usual definition for the classical entropy of a system\nS = kB ln\u03a9\nwhere \u03a9 is the number of microstates compatible with some given values of\nthe macroscopic parameters (eg temperature, pressure, volume etc) and kB\nis Boltzmann's constant, we immediately deduce that a BH must have zero\nentropy classically since ln1 = 0.\nBut then we encounter the qualitative argument originally due to Beckenstein that if this was indeed the case, then any object, e.g. some gas,\nfalling into a BH would contradict the second law of thermodynamics. To\navoid that one should associate a nonzero entropy (positive of course) to\nany BH. The precise value of the entropy S of a BH was then determined by\nthe Hawking area formula which, ignoring constants, reads (see for example\n[16])\nS\u223cA\nwhere A is the area of the event horizon. So if we denote by R the radius\nof the event horizon of a BH, its entropy is proportional to R2 and not proportional to R3 . The origin of BH entropy was understood to be quantum\n3\n\n\fmechanical.\nAt this point we should make a comment: the Hawking formula is quite\nsurprising, remarkable and counterintuitive since from what we know from\nthermodynamics the entropy of a system depends on its volume but in this\ncase of black holes a dimensional reduction occures and in fact the entropy\nis proportional only to the area of its event horizon.\nNonetheless we know that statistical physics gives a more fundamental\nexplanation of the laws of thermodynamics and moreover a correct \"wouldbe\" quantum theory of gravity should explain the origin of the quantum\nstates associated to a BH. So the challenge was to find a statistical explanation for the quantum states associated to a BH which give rise to its entropy\ndescribed by the Hawking formula.\nSuperstring theory can indeed, in some cases, provide an explanation for\nthe origin of quantum states associated to multicharged extremal black holes.\nAnd anyway string theory is arguably the best known candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The argument which explains the microscopic origin\nof BH entropy starting from string theory was originally due to Strominger,\nVafa, Horowitz and Maldacena and it is based on S-duality. The later is a\nstatement about an isomorphism between strong and weak coupling regions\nof superstring theory; equivalently it interchanges monopoles with charges\nin the theory (or equivalently it interchanges topology and dynamics) and\ngives us the ability to identify BPS superstring states which will either be\nperturbative states if they carry NS charges or D-branes if they carry R\ncharges in \"weak coupling\" region with extremal black holes carrying the\nanalogous type of charge in \"strong coupling\" region. We restrict our attention to BPS states (these are states whose mass does not receive any\nquantum corrections) because for simplicity we assume no backcreation for\nthe black hole (namely its mass which is equal to its energy remains constant). Briefly then the main idea behind this string theoretic explanation\nof the quantum states associated to a black hole is that since superstrings\nlive in 10-dim and BH in 4-dim, the remaining 6 compactified dimensions\nessentially provide a \"phase space\" which we quantize and thus we obtain\nthe states of the BH. (This picture is not utterly correct but we think captures the spirit of the argument and gives a clear picture conceptually). For\na possible noncommutative generalisation of the Beckenstein-Hawking areaentropy formula for BHs see [12].\n4\n\n\f2. The second problem we would like to consider in BH physics is the\nso-called \"information paradox\". Classically, nothing can escape the event\nhorizon of a BH (since that would require a velocity which is grater than\nthe velocity of light; one can use that as a definition of the \"event horizon\").\nYet quantum mechanically, since a BH has a positive entropy as we just\nargued above, assuming a thermodynamical behaviour, it should also have a\ncorresponding temperature from the well-known relation in thermodynamics\n(dM =)dE = T dS.\nThis is the Hawking temperature\nTH =\n\n~\u03ba\n2kB \u03c0\n\nwhere \u03ba is surface gravity (the acceleration felt by a static object at the\nhorizon as measured from the asymptotic region), and hence BH's should\nalso radiate.\nThis is the Hawking radiation. Then the problem with radiation carrying out the information of formation, assuming no quantum xeroxing, is to\nmaintain unitarity of the process as ordinary quantum mechanics requires.\nMore precisely, the way one computes Hawking radiation is by assuming a\ncodim-1 foliation of spacetime where the normal direction is time and this\nradiation process appears to be nonunitary. (For a more general discussion\nabout foliations and the relation between physical and topological entropy\none can see [11] and [12]).\nThus trying to avoid a classical contradiction with the 2nd law of thermodynamics we assumed that BH's have positive entropy (whose origin is\nquantum mechanical); yet this almost immediately created another contradiction with quantum mechanics: loss of unitarity in BH radiation. Unitarity\nis absolutely crucial in any quantum theory since it reflects the conservation\nof probabilities. So it seems that we didn't actually achieve very much: we\nsimply \"pushed\" the contradiction from the classical to the quantum realm.\nIt appears that the most economical (i.e. requiring the fewest changes to\nthings we already know in physics) way out is to assume that there is some\nphysical principle which does not allow this to happen. We enforce unitarity\n5\n\n\fthroughout by imposing a non-locality mechanism. One such mechanism is\nthe holography principle due to G. 't Hooft (see [2]). The original statement\nis the following:\n\"A quantum theory of gravity on a (d+1)-manifold with boundary should\nbe equivalent to a conformal field theory (CFT for short) on the boundary\n(which is a d-manifold) and this conformal field theory on the boundary must\nhave one degree of freedom per Planck area\".\nLet us elaborate more on this: since for BH we seem to lose any information passing the event horizon, it is reasonable to assume that in order\nto avoid this problem (along with its quantum mechanical incarnation of\nnonunitary radiation), everything that happens inside the black hole should\nbe described from data on its event horizon. It is clear we think that the\nmotivation for this dimensional reduction of quantum gravity in holography\ncame from the formula for the black hole entropy: the entropy of a black\nhole is proportional to the area and not the volume of the event horizon.\nAnother very useful way of thinking about the holography principle is\nthat it simply says that for a given 3-volume V in space the state of maximal\nentropy in nature is given by the largest BH that fits inside V , (silently we\nare making use of the Hawking formula which says that the entropy of a BH\nis proportional to the area of its event horizon).\nThis principle has a deep consequence on perturbative quantum field theory: BH's provide a natural cut-off limit since the above statement says\nthat for fermions for example one cannot have a huge amount of energy\nconcentrated in a tiny region of space because that would collapse into a\nBH.\nThere is also a superstring theoretic version of the holography principle\nusing string theory language, the so-called \"Maldacena conjecture\" which\nstates that string theory on the smooth manifold AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 is dual to\nN = 4 SYM SU (N ) gauge theory on the boundary of AdS5 . In this talk we\nshall primarily build our understanding of Kontsevich's statement based on\nthis string theoretic version of holography. However let us for the moment\ngo back to the original 't Hooft version of holography and ask:\n(Key Question:) What is a D = d CFT?\n6\n\n\fIn order to answer the above question and eventually understand Kontsevich's statement, we should start by trying to understand the D = 2 case\nfirst. We know from G. Segal what a D = 2 CFT is, so it seems that somehow we have to generalise his work.\nA good motivation to study D = 2 CFT comes from string theory itself,\none can say in fact that D = 2 CFT is intimately related to string theory:\nstrings are 1-dim objects which in time sweep out 2-manifolds called worldsheets; this is the higher dimensional analogue of the paths (1-dim geometric\nobjects) swept out in time by point particles. However now we are talking\nabout M-Theory in physics which generalises string theory and M-Theory\ncontains the M2 and M5 branes; these are 2 and 5-dim objects respectively\nwhose worldsheets are 3 and 6-dim manifolds. So apart from holography,\nthere is additional motivation coming from M-Theory to understand higher\ndimensional CFT's: a D = d CFT is the theory describing (d \u2212 1)-branes.\nNow we would like to describe briefly what string theory is classically:\nbasically it is a \u03c3-model, namely it describes harmonic maps \u03c6 : \u03a3g \u2192 X 10\nwhere \u03a3g is a Riemann surface of genus g representing the worldsheets of\nstrings and X is a 26-dim Riemannian manifold with a B-field. The dimensionality of X is fixed from consistency arguments (compatibility with\nspecial relativity and cancellation of the conformal anomaly). The B-field\nis a real valued 2-form which is used as a potential to gauge the worldsheets\nof the strings in order to get our Dirac phase factors; in fact one can think\nof it as the Poincare Dual (a 2-form) of the worldsheet which is a 2-manifold\n(it is the analogue of the gauge potentials in Yang-Mills theory, connection\n1-forms, although now it has to be a 2-form instead of a 1-form since we\nare talking about strings whose worlsheets are 2-manifolds whereas for point\nparticles we needed 1-forms because their \"worlsheets\" were 1-dim objects).\nThis picture needs to include fermions as well in order to be complete but\nwe shall not elaborate more on this. The introduction of fermions along\nwith supersymmetry reduces the dimensionality of X from 26 down to 10.\nThe quantum theory of strings is essentially a D = 2 CFT (plus a little\nbit more structure as we shall see later). In order to describe D = 2 CFT\none may use the original geometric approach due to G. Segal. This approach\nhowever does not lead to the statement of Kontsevich in a straightforward\nway. Moreover it is not easy to see how it can be generalised to higher\n7\n\n\fdimensions which is what we are after. Instead we shall adopt an algebraic\napproach using the language of operads; in fact we shall see the little 2-discs\noperad C2 (n) arising naturally in our discussion. This is the crucial step\nin order to understand Kontsevich's statement which is the higher dimensional version of this beautiful fact. The appearence of the operad C2 (n) in\nstring theory is not at all obvious and at least for us quite surprising. The\nlink between string theory and the little 2-discs operad C2 (n) comes from\na deep theorem due to Fred Cohen as we shall try to exhibit shortly. For\nsimplicity we shall restrict our discussion to closed strings. But we shall do\nthat in the last section because we need some mathematical definitions first.\nThe final remark here is that we would still like to generalise Segal's work\nand get a geometric definition of D = d CFT. Currently this seems out of\nreach since there are two reasons which make Segal's approach particularly\nnice for the D = 2 case (but at the same time act as barriers when trying\nto generalise into higher dimensions): the conformal group in this case is\ninfinite dimensional and hence contains a lot more information whereas in\nhigher dimensions the conformal group is only finite dimensional. The second reason is that the classification of (compact say) 2-manifolds is simple:\ncompact 2-manifolds are classified by their genus (ie the number of holes)\nwhereas for D = 3 it is not known if 3-manifolds can be classified and in\ndimensions D \u2265 4 we can only classify simply connected manifolds (in perturbative quantum field theory that means we can only talk about tree level).\n\n3\n\nA Mathematical Interlude\n\nIn this section now we shall give formal definitions.\nDefinition 1:\nA Gerstenhaber algebra (or a G-algebra) is a graded vector space V = \u2295i\u2208Z Vi\nwith a dot product x * y defining the structure of a graded commutative\nassociative algebra along with a bracket operation [x, y] of degree -1 defining\nthe structure of a graded Lie algebra such that the bracket is a derivation\nwith respect to the dot product, i.e. it satisfies the Leibniz rule\n[x, y * z] = [x, y] * z + (\u22121)(deg(x)\u22121)deg(y) y * [x, z]\nExamples:\ni.

The\ncup product is not graded commutative (it is only associative) but the induced operation on cohomology is graded commutative. Moreover the Gbracket induces an operation on cohomology which satisfies the Leibniz rule\nwith respect to the cup product, hence the Hochschild cohomology of any\nassociative algebra is in fact a G-algebra.\nWe shall briefly mention three more examples of G-algebras:\nii. Polyvector fields on smooth manifolds with wedge product and SchoutenNijenhuis bracket.\niii. Exterior algebra of a Lie algebra with wedge product and extension\nof the Lie bracket.\n\n9\n\n\fiv. (Rational) homology of double loop space with Pontrjagin product\nand Samelson bracket.\nDefinition 2:\nAn operad P (of vector spaces) consists of the following data:\na. a collection of vector spaces P (n), n \u2265 0,\nb. an action of the symmetric group Sn on P (n) for every n,\nc. an identity element idP \u2208 P (1),\nd. compositions m(n1 ,...,nk )\nP (k) \u2297 (P (n1 ) \u2297 ... \u2297 P (nk )) \u2192 P (n1 + ... + nk )\nfor every k \u2265 0 and n1 , ..., nk \u2265 0. These compositions have to be associative,\nequivariant with respect to the symmetric group actions and the identity\nelement idP has to satisfy the following naturality property with respect to\nthe composition:\nm(n) (idP , p) = p\nand\nm(n,1,...,1)(p, idP , ..., idP ) = p\nfor all p \u2208 P (n) (one can have a look at [4] for more details).\nExample: The \"endomorphism operad\" of a vector space V is given by\nP (n) := Hom(V \u2297n , V ) where the action of the symmetric group and the\nidentity element are the obvious ones and the compositions are defined by\nthe substitutions\n(m(n1 ,...,nk) (\u03c6 \u2297 (\u03c81 \u2297 ... \u2297 \u03c8k )))(v1 \u2297 ... \u2297 vn1 +...+nk )\n:= \u03c6(\u03c81 (v1 \u2297 ... \u2297 vn1 ) \u2297 ... \u2297 \u03c8k (vn1 +...+nk\u22121+1 \u2297 ...\n\u2297vn1 +...+nk ))\nwhere \u03c6 \u2208 P (k) := Hom(V \u2297k , V ), \u03c8i \u2208 P (ni ) := Hom(V \u2297ni , V ) and\ni = 1, 2, ..., k.\nDefinition 3:\nAn algebra over an operad P (of vector spaces), or a P-algebra, (or equivalently a representation of the operad P ), consists of a vector space A and a\ncollection of multilinear maps fn : P (n) \u2297 A\u2297n \u2192 A for all n \u2265 0 satisfying\nthe following axioms:\n10\n\n\fa. for any n \u2265 0 the map fn is Sn -equivariant,\nb. for any a \u2208 A we have f1 (idP \u2297 a) = a,\nc. all compositions in P map to compositions of multilinear operations in A.\nIn other words the structure of an algebra over P on a vector space A is\ngiven by a homomorphism from P to the endomorphism operad of A.\nOne can also define modules over algebras over operads.\nOne can construct operads denoted Assoc(n), Lie(n), P oisson(n), G(n),\nA\u221e (n), L\u221e (n), G\u221e (n) such that algebras over these operads are associative\nalgebras, Lie algebras, Poisson algebras, Gerstenhaber algebras and their\nhomotopic versions respectively but there is no operad for Hopf algebras\n(for more details see [4]).\nIn the definition of operads we can replace our vector space V by a compact topological space X and hence define operads over topological spaces\nreplacing tensor product with Cartesian product.\nThe analogue of the endomorphism operad will in this case be P (n) :=\n{ContinuousM aps : X n \u2192 X}. Then one can define algebras over topological operads accordingly.\nMore generally one can define operads and algebras over operads over\nobjects of any symmetric monoidal category C, namely a category endowed\nwith the functor \u2297 : C \u00d7 C \u2192 C, the identity element 1C \u2208 Obj(C) and the\nappropriate coherence isomorphisms for associativity and commutativity of\n\u2297-product.\nOperads themselves can be seen as algebras over the coloured operad.\n(see [8] p.12 Remark 1.)\nIn particular we would like to consider operads in the symmetric monoidal\ncategory Complexes whose objects are Z-graded complexes of abelian groups\nand arrows morphisms of complexes. These are called differential graded\noperads or dg-operads for short. So each component P (n) of an operad of\ncomplexes will be a complex, namely a vector space decomposed into a direct\nsum P (n) = \u2295i\u2208Z P (n)i and endowed with a differential d : P (n)i \u2192 P (n)i+1\nof degree +1 such that d2 = 0. Then every dg-operad P has a corresponding\nhomology operad denoted H\u2217 (P ).\n11\n\n\fKey idea:\nThere is a natural way to construct an operad of complexes from a topological operad by using essentially the singular chain complex of topological\nspaces.\nLet d \u2265 1 be an integer. Denote by Gd the (d + 1)-dimensional Lie group\nof affine transformations acting on Rd via u 7\u2192 \u03bbu + v where \u03bb > 0 is a\nreal number and v \u2208 Rd is a vector. This group acts simply transitively on\nthe space of closed discs in Rd and the disc with centre v and radius \u03bb is\nobtained from the standard disc\nD0 := {(x1 , ..., xd ) \u2208 Rd |x21 + ... + x2d \u2264 1}\nby a transformation from Gd with parameters (v, \u03bb).\nDefinition 4:\nThe little d-discs operad Cd (n) is a topological operad with the following\nstructure:\na. Cd (0) := \u2205,\nb. Cd (1) := \u2217,\nc. for n \u2265 2 the space Cd (n) is the space of configurations of n disjoint\nd-discs (Di )1\u2264i\u2264n inside the standard d-disc D0 .\nThe composition\nCd (k) \u00d7 Cd (n1 ) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Cd (nk ) \u2192 Cd (n1 + ... + nk )\nis obtained by applying elements from Gd associated with discs (Di )1\u2264i\u2264n in\nthe configuration in Cd (k) to configurations in all Cd (ni ), i = 1, 2, ..., k and\nputting the resulting configurations together. The action of the symmetric\ngroup Sn on Cd (n) is given by renumerations of indices of discs (Di )1\u2264i\u2264n .\nRemark: The little d-discs operad Cd (n) was introduced by Peter May\n(see [13]) and Boardmann-Vogt (see [14]), in the late 70's in order to describe\nhomotopy types of d-fold loop spaces, namely spaces of continuous maps\nd\nM aps(S+\n, X+ )\n\nwhere \"+\" denotes base point, X is a topological space, S d is the d-dim\nsphere. The little d-discs operad is the most important operad in homotopy\n12\n\n\ftheory.\nThe key result relating the little d-discs operad Cd (n) with d-fold loop\nspaces is that (with field coefficients) chains of d-fold loop spaces become\nnaturally d-algebras i.e. algebras over the operad ChainsCd (n). (In fact\nthe above statement is true even without taking \"chains\" in both sides).\nWe have the following well-known\nFact: The space Cd (n) is homotopy equivalent to the configuration space of\nn pairwise distinct points in Rd :\nF(n, Rd ) := (Rd )n \u2212 Diag = {(v1 , ..., vn ) \u2208 (Rd )n\n|vi 6= vj for i 6= j}\nDefinition 5:\nLet Cd \u0303(n) := F(n, Rd )/Gd which is also the Fulton-MacPherson operad\nF Md (n).\nFor n = 2, F Md (2) is homotopy equivalent to the (d \u2212 1)-sphere S d\u22121 .\nFor all n \u2265 3, F Md (n) is a manifold with corners which can be identified\nexplicitly.\nDefinition 6:\nFor d \u2265 0, a d-algebra is an algebra over the operad Chains(Cd ) in the\ncategory of complexes.\nOne then has:\nTheorem 1. (F. Cohen, see [6]).\nThere is a natural homotopy equivalence\nG(n) \u2243 H\u2217 [ChainsC2 (n)]\nRecall the fact that the Hochschild cohomology of any associative algebra has a natural G-algebra structure. The original Deligne conjecture\n(see [3]), was that the Hochschild complex of an associative algebra (or\nmore generally the Hochschild complex of an A\u221e -algebra as mentioned in\n[8]) itself carries a natural 2-algebra structure, i.e. it has an action of the\n\n13\n\n\foperad ChainsC2 (n). Its higher dimensional version due to Kontsevich says:\n\"For any d \u2212 algebra there is a natural action of a universal (in an appropriate sense defined up to homotopy) (d + 1) \u2212 algebra\".\nUseful facts:\nAssoc(n) \u2243 H\u2217 [ChainsC1 (n)]\nLie(n) \u2243 Hn\u22121 [ChainsC2 (n)]\nSince in general homotopic versions of various algebras appear when the\nproduct is originally defined on the cohomology and one wants to \"lift\"\nthe structure to the cochain level, one has the following general relations\nbetween algebras and their \"homotopic versions\":\nAssoc(n) \u2243 H\u2217 [A\u221e (n)]\nLie(n) \u2243 H\u2217 [L\u221e (n)]\nG(n) \u2243 H\u2217 [G\u221e (n)]\nAside: The above discussion was about the little discs operad and based\nloop spaces. One also has a variation of the above, the so called framed little d-discs operad denoted Cdf (n) which is related to free loop spaces. The\nframed little 2-discs operad C2f (n) is homotopic to the cactus operad and\nthe (rational) homology of the framed little 2-discs operad is homotopic to\nthe BV-operad. The main result is then that the (rational) homology of the\nfree loop space H\u2217 (LX) where X is a compact oriented manifold (after an\napropriate shift) has a BV-algebra structure, namely it is an algebra over\nthe Batalin-Vilkovisky operad. At this point we would like to remind the\nreader of the fact that BV-algebras appear in the Lagrangian formalism of\nfield theories whereas Gerstenhaber algebras appear in BRST cohomology\nwhich is Hamiltoniam formalism of a field theory. For more details on the\ncactus operad, free loops and BV algebras we refer to [10].\nThen the second important result is the following\nTheorem 2: (D. Tamarkin 1998, see [9]).\nIn characteristic zero, the operad Chains(Cd ) \u2297 R is formal, i.e. it is\nhomotopy equivalent to its corresponding homology operad.\n\n14\n\n\f4\n\nThe appearence of the operad C2(n) in string\ntheory\n\nAfter giving all these mathematical definitions we now return back to physics.\nG. Segal (see [15]), defined a D = 2 CFT as roughly a topological vector space HS 1 and to each cobordism (which physically represents a Feynman diagram for strings which are 1-dim objects with 2-dim worldsheets)\n\u03a3g : S 1\nS 1 we associate an operator U\u03a3g where \u03a3g is a Riemann surface\nof genus g with a conformal class on it. We can replace the boundary of \u03a3g\nwith more copies of S 1 representing more than one incoming and outgoing\nclosed strings. The case g = 0 corresponds to tree-level in physics.\nThe space of maps U\u03a3g is parametrised by A := Conf (\u03a3g )/Dif f (\u03a3g , \u2202\u03a3g )\nand A acts on HS 1 where the denominator denotes diffeomorphisms which\nbecome the identity on the boundary. A is only a semigroup under concatenation but it has a Lie algebra V ect(S 1 )C and its fundamental group is\nZ. We have a composition law on HS 1 for every conformal structure on \u03a3g\nwhich is associative up to the action of A.\nMore concretely we use Lagrangian formalism and write\nZ\ne\u2212S(\u03c6) D\u03c6\nU\u03a3g =\n\u03c6:\u03a3g \u2192R\n\nwhere\nS(\u03c6) :=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6 \u2227 \u2217d\u03c6\n\n\u03a3g\n\nIf we change the conformal class on \u03a3g by f , then U\u03a3g is multiplied\nby the factor ecL(f ) where c is the central charge and L(f ) is given by the\nLiouville formula\nZ\n1\n1\n[ df \u2227 \u2217df + f KG + (e2f \u2212 1)\u03c9G ]\nL(f ) =\n2\n\u03a3g 2\nwhere G is the metric with Gauss curvature K and volume form \u03c9G .\nMoreover HS 1 carries a projective representation of the cobordism category,\nthus each cobordism \u03a3g has associated to it a complex line bundle (in its\nmost general form these are tensor products of determinant line bundles\n\n15\n\n\fd\nwhich generalise the usual basis Ln = eih\u03b8 d\u03b8\nof V ect(S 1 )C ).\n\nThis geometric picture of G. Segal is very nice but when trying to generalise it in higher dimensions one faces problems.\nNow we shall modify Segal's definition using the more convenient language of operads, we follow [4]. We shall swich to Hamiltonian formalism\nand point out that our formalism below is less satisfactory than G. Segal's\nbecause it works only for genus 0 Riemannian surfaces but it is easier to\ngeneralise in higher dimensions. We shal explain in detail the structures\nappearing in the D = 2 case and then we shall try to see how much can be\nimmediately generalised to higher dimensions.\nBefore doing that we would like to make a comment: there are two ways\nto construct operads related to Riemann surfaces: the first one is by using\nmoduli spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces and compactify them, such\noperads are roughly denoted M (n); the second is by decorating the puctures\nwith local coordinates. One can sew two Riemann surfaces together unambiguously (up to modular equivalence) by using suitable local coordinates.\nLet R(n) be the moduli space of nondegenerate Riemann spheres \u03a3 with\nn labelled punctures and non-overlapping holomorphic discs at each puncture (holomorphic embeddings of the standard disc |z| < 1 to \u03a3 centered\nat the puncture). The spaces R(n), n \u2208 N\u2217 form an operad under sewing\nRiemann spheres at punctures (cutting out the discs |z| \u2264 r and |w| \u2264 r for\nsome r = 1 \u2212 \u01eb at sewn punctures and identifying the annuli r < |z| < 1/r\nand r < |w| < 1/r via w = 1/z). The symmetric group interchanges punctures along with the holomorphic discs.\nConsider the complexification V of the Virasoro algebra of complex valued vector fields on the circle, generated by elements Lm = z m+1 \u2202/\u2202z,\nm \u2208 Z, with the commutators [Lm , Ln ] = (n \u2212 m)Lm+n . Then one has:\nDefinition 7:\nA D = 2 conformal field theory at tree level consists of the following data:\n1. A topological vector space H called state space.\n2. An action T : V \u2297 H \u2192 H of the Virasoro algebra V on H.\n3. A vector |\u03a3 > \u2208 Hom(H \u2297n , H) for each \u03a3 \u2208 R(n) depending smoothly\non \u03a3. These data must satisfy the following relations:\n16\n\n\f4. T (v)|\u03a3 >= |\u03b4(v)\u03a3 >, where v = (v1 , ..., vn ) \u2208 V and \u03b4 is the natural\naction of V n on R(n) by infinitesimal reparametrisations at punctures. In\nparticular T (v)|\u03a3 >= 0 whenever v can be extended to a holomorphic vector field on \u03a3 outside of the discs.\n5. The correspondence \u03a3 7\u2192 |\u03a3 > defines the structure of an algebra over\nthe operad R(n) on the space of states H.\nSo briefly, the slogan is that a D = 2 CFT is an algebra over the operad\nR(n).\nDefinition 8:\nA string background (at the tree level) is a D = 2 CFT based on the vector\nspace H with the following additional data:\n1. A Z-grading H = \u2295i\u2208Z Hi on the state space.\n2. An action of the Clifford algebra C(V \u2295V \u2217 ) which is denoted b : V \u2297H \u2192\nH and c : V \u2217 \u2297 H \u2192 H for generators of the Clifford algebra, the degree of\nb is -1 and the degree of c is +1.\n3. A differential Q : H \u2192 H, Q2 = 0, of degree +1 called BRST operator\nsatisfying Qb + bQ = T .\nThe differential graded complex (H, Q) is called the BRST complex and\nthe degree is called the ghost number.\nOne of the nicest implications of a string background is the construction of a morphism of complexes \u03c9n : Hom(H, H \u2297n ) \u2192 \u03a9\u2217 (R(n)), from the\ncomplex of linear mappings between tensor powers of the BRST complex H\nto the de Rham complex of the space R(n).\nTaking the cohomology of the BRST complex gives the space of physical states. In physics this amounts to mod out gauge invariance (this is a\ncohomological approach to symplectic reduction in the case of a symplectic\nmanifold carrying a Lie group action which is more convenient in infinite\ndimensions, i.e. field theory).\nThen a closed string field theory is a string background together with\na morphism of operads \u03c8 : M (n) \u2192 R(n). This however does not readily generalise to higher dimensions since both operads M (n) and R(n) are\nrelated to moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. The aspect of closed string\nfield theory which will be useful for higher dimensional generalisations is the\n17\n\n\ffollowing:\nKey fact in physics: The space of physical states in closed string field\ntheory (namely BRST cohomology) has the structure of a Gerstenhaber algebra.\nLet us explain this a little bit more: from the work of G. Segal we knew\nthat in general D = 2 topological quantum field theories (and in particular\nclosed string field theory) are Z-graded commutative associative Frobenious\nalgebras, hence they are graded associative algebras. Yet it was observed by\nWitten and Zwiebach that closed string field theory also carries the structure of a Differential Graded Lie Algebra relative to another grading which\nis \"the associative grading - 1\". In fact these 2 structures can be combined\ntogether to give a G-algebra structure.\nNow we make use of Cohen's theorem saying that G-algebras correspond\nexactly to the homology of the chains of the little 2-discs operad and of\nTamarkin's result to deduce that the space of physical states of closed string\nfield theory (which is a special case of D = 2 CFT) has a natural (defined\nup to homotopy) 2-algebra structure.\nSo this is the important relation between strings and the operad C2 (n)\nthat plays the fundamental role to understand Kontsevich's statement which\nis then simply the higher dimensional version of the above fact which originally holds for strings (D = 2 case).\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nLet us start with some\nRemarks:\n1. The original Deligne conjecture, namely the case d = 1, was proved\nby Kontsevich and Soibelman in 2000 using ideas and techniques from Dan\nQuillen's homotopical algebra (see [5]), which roughly is a non-linear generalisation of homological algebra.\n\n18\n\n\f2. As Kontsevich explains in his article, from Deligne's conjecture and\nfrom Tamarkin's theorem (namely the formality of the operad ChainsCd (n)),\nfollows almost immediately his earlier result on deformation quantization of\nsymplectic (Poisson) manifolds for the case where the associative algebra of\ninterest is just the polynomial algebra in n variables\nA := R[x1 , ..., xn ].\nLet us recall that Kontsevich's result was that for the associative algebra A\nabove one has that its Hochschild complex C \u2217 (A, A) is homotopic as a Lie\nalgebra to its Hochschild cohomology H \u2217 (A, A). An equivalent statement is\nthat for the Euclidean space X = Rn , the Hochschild complex of the associative algebra of functions on X equipped with the Gerstenhaber bracket\nis homotopic as DGLA to the Z-graded superalgebra of polyvector fields on\nX equipped with the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket.\n3. The structure of an A\u221e -algebra has appeared recently in open strings.\nMoreover let us mention that one of the main examples of homotopy associative algebras (or A\u221e -algebras) is singular chains of based loops.\nPerhaps here we should mention another important result: the BRST\ncomplex of closed string field theory has also the structure of a G\u221e -algebra\n(see [4]). That makes someone to speculate on a relation between the operads G\u221e (n) and ChainsC2 (n). For example it is unknown if double loop\nspaces (which are the primary examples of 2-algebras) also carry a homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra structure.\nNow let us try to answer the following question: Why should physics care\nabout the Deligne conjecture? We think for 2 reasons:\ni. The fact that the Hochschild complex of an associative algebra is a\n2-algebra (original conjecture) is related to the action of the GrothendieckTeichmuller (G-T) group. The fact that the Hochschild complex plays the\nfundamental role in the theory of deformations of associative algebras explains why its study is important in quantum field theory if one adopts the\ndeformation quantization approach.\nIn other words the goal is to understand the action of the G-T group\non the space of all deformation quantizations on the associative algebra of\n19\n\n\ffunctions (in fact one needs a little more structure, i.e. a Poisson algebra\nstructure) on a given (spacetime or phase space respectively) manifold and\nthis is believed to be related to gauge symmetry. Yet all these are far from\nbeing clear at the moment. Let us briefly recall that the GrothendieckTeichmuller group can be defined as the automorphism group of the tower\nof the pro-nilpotent completions of the pure braid groups; the pure braid\ngroup of n strings is the fundamental group of the configuration space of n\npoints in the plane F(n, R2 ).\nii. Let us forget deformation quantization now and let's focus on holography: If one wants to understand (d+1)-dim quantum gravity, one approach\nis to follow holography. This means that equivalently one should understand\nD = d CFT. From the string theory example we have learnt that D = 2\nCFT is related to 2-algebras. It is then reasonable to expect that D = d\nCFT should be related to d-algebras. So the hope is that this higher dimensional Deligne conjecture will tell us something about the \"BRST complex\"\nwhose cohomology would describe the D = d CFT. So the D = d CFT is\na d-algebra and following the Hamiltonian formalism the space of physical\nstates will be expresseed as a cohomology; then the Deligne conjecture will\ncontain information about the cochain level of the cohomology. This information at the cochain level has a nice geometric interpretation as follows (if\none adopts the Lagrangian formalism of the theory):\nHolography tells us that (d + 1)-quantum gravity is reduced to some\n(conformal) field theory on the boundary. Obviously there are many (d+ 1)quantum gravity theories which will have the same boundary theory, simply because there are many (d + 1)-manifolds with the same d-manifold as\nboundary. Consider all (d + 1)-bulk theories then with the same boundary d-theory as some sort of an extra \"gauge freedom\", ie that they define a \"fibre\" over the fixed boundary d-theory. Equivalently, we have a\nwhole cobordismm class of a boundary theory consisting of bulk theories\nwhich, because of holography, are physically the same theory. Assuming\nthat the boundary theory is described by a d-algebra, we know that the\nGrothendieck-Teichmuller group acts in an analogous way that the gauge\ngroup acts in ordinary gauge theories (the fibres are essentially the gauge\norbits). The higher dimensional Deligne conjecture is another way to express\nthis action of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group which takes care of this\nextra gauge freedom arising from the fact that many (d + 1)-bulk theories\nhave the same resulting boundary d-theory. This is roughly the statement\n20\n\n\fthat the Hochschild complex of a d-algerba has a natural (appropriately defined up to homotopy) (d + 1)-algebra structure.\nYet this is not still the end of the story: the action of the G-T group is\nclosely related to the action of the motivic group: since the little d-discs operad is formal, we can form a torsor ; in general given any pair of equivalent\nobjects A and B in a category, we can form the space of all isomorphisms\nbetween the objects A and B denoted Iso(A, B). The groups of automorphisms of both A and B denoted Aut(A) and Aut(B) respectively act naturally on Iso(A, B) and their actions commute. A torsor is a structure that\nencodes this information. If we think of the formality of the operad Cd (n) as\ndefining a pair of equivalent objects in the category of Z-graded complexes,\nwe can indeed define a torsor and then the action of the G-T group will\nplay the role of say Aut(A) whereas the motivic group wil play the role of\nAut(B). Further evidence that our proposal to use d-algebras to describe\nD = d CFT is not at all unreasonable comes from the fact that Tamarkin in\norder to prove his formality theorem he made use of the Drinfeld-Kazhdan\nassociator whose origin is the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, namely it\ncomes directly from D = 2 CFT! (For the precise definitions of the motivic\ngroup and the Drinfeld-Kazhdan associator we refer to [7]).\nGoing back to physics a pessimist might argue that the holography principle does not really \"resolve\" the BH paradoxe; it simply pushes it even\nfurther to the realm of quantum gravity which is terra incognita for today's\nphysics. We however would like to adopt a more positive point of view: by\naccepting the validity of holography we can actually use it in order to learn\nsomething about quantum gravity and at the same time we try to understand its wider implications for physics. Finally we would like to mention\nthat there have been already some positive tests for the validity of holography mainly in the framework of some calculations related to its string\ntheoretic version (Maldacena conjecture).\nOperads (and the little discs operad in particular) currently should be\nseen more as an algebraic framework to conceptually understand higher dimensional CFT's. As a computational device in D = 2 CFT people use\nTopologiacl Vertex Operator Algebras (TVOA) as a tool to construct topological CFT but again their higher dimensional generalisation is not obvious.\nThe final comment we would like to make is the following: the structure\n21\n\n\fof a Gerstenhaber algebra which was observed in D = 2 CFT ment that the\ndot product (which gives the OPE) and the Lie bracket (which gives the\nconformal symmetry) are combined in a \"nice way\" in the space of physical states (ie that the bracket is a derivation with respect to the product).\nOur proposal that higher dimensional CFT's are described by d-algebras\nmeans that roughly we still have this nice combination in higher dimensions\nbetween the dot product and the Lie bracket. However in general a Gerstenhaber algebra \"does not care\" whether the Lie bracket comes specifically\nfrom conformal symmetry. Thus our proposal looks more like an algebraic\nframework to understand higher dimensional CFT and holography for the\nmoment; however if we want to make its relation with physics-with conformal symmetry in particular-more concrete and if we want to properly and\nfully justify the proposal that a d-algebra should describe D = d CFT, we\nwould have to add more specific information about conformal symmetry (Lie\nbracket) and dot product (OPE) in higher dimensions. So it seems that the\nproblem is not whether our proposal is valid but rather that it may be far\ntoo general to be of any practical use. In any case it helps conceptually we\nbelieve. For example one desired property would be to consider representations of the operad Cd (n) on the endomorphism operad of a Clifford algebra\n(and not just a vector space) in order to make the theory chiral. However\nfor the moment we do not know how to incorporate the Cardy condition in\nour formalism.\nAcknowledgements:\nThe author would like to thank Maxim Kontsevich and Graeme Segal\nfor useful discussions.
