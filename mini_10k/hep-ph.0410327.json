Introduction\nInclusive B-meson decays, such as charmless semileptonic B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 decays and penguininduced B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 decays, are of special interest because they are sensitive probes of electroweak parameters as well as new physics. Theoretical analysis of the corresponding (differential) decay rates has been developed on the basis of the operator product expansion\n(OPE) as a power series in \u039bQCD /mb .1) This provides justification for the parton model and\nalso the power corrections to it in terms of matrix elements of local operators.2) It is known,\nhowever, that the usual OPE becomes singular near the kinematic endpoint E/Emax \u223c 1\n\nfor the lepton (photon) energy spectrum in the decay B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 (B \u2192 Xs \u03b3); the endpoint\nregion plays an important role in experimental analysis, especially for the precise determi-\n\nnation of the CKM matrix element |Vub | from B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304, avoiding large backgrounds from\nthe decays into charmed particles, B \u2192 Xc l\u03bd\u0304. In the endpoint region, the hadronic decay\nproducts evolving from the u-quark (s-quark) in B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 (B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) have large energy\n\nbut small invariant mass, so that the hadronic final state becomes jet-like with collinear\ninteractions of an outgoing light quark. This implies that the short-distance expansion is\n\nnot applicable, receiving the light-cone singularity, and the OPE has to be reorganized with\nthe resummation of the most singular terms.3), 4) This is accomplished through the lightcone expansion, which is similar to the treatment in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering\n(DIS). As the result, at the leading power of \u039bQCD /mb , the shape of the decay spectrum is\ndescribed by an analogue of the leading twist in the DIS, i.e., by the factorization formula,\nwhere a structure function corresponding to the nonperturbative, long-distance (\u223c 1/\u039bQCD )\ncontribution is convoluted with the perturbatively calculable function.3)\u20135) The structure\nfunction, called the shape function, is process independent and universal in the sense that\nthe same shape function determines the decay spectrum of both B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 and B \u2192 Xs \u03b3.\n\nMore rigorous treatments of the factorization with three relevant mass scales, hard (mb ),\np\nhard-collinear ( mb \u039bQCD ), and soft (\u039bQCD ), have been presented recently in the framework of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET).6)\u20139) Those treatments have shown that the\nperturbatively calculable function is composed of two parts, the hard function due to the\nhard corrections and the jet function due to hard-collinear fluctuations associated with the\nlight-quark jet, and that the resulting factorization formulae for B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 and B \u2192 Xs \u03b3\nare valid to all orders in \u03b1s .5)\u20138)\nOne-loop corrections10) as well as the resummation of large (leading and next-to-leading)\nendpoint logarithms5), 7)\u20139), 11)\u201313) have been calculated for perturbatively calculable functions\nin the factorization formulae for B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 and B \u2192 Xs \u03b3. Also for the shape function,\n\none-loop renormalization group evolution has been studied by many authors.7)\u20139), 13)\u201315) Un2\n\n\ffortunately, however, our understanding of the nonperturbative boundary value in the corresponding evolution equation is still poor. There have been some attempts to constrain\nthe boundary value of the shape function by estimating the relevant nonperturbative effects,\ne.g., trying to relate the moments of the shape function with the fundamental parameters\nin the heavy-quark effective theory (HQET),3), 4), 16), 17) and examining the ambiguity (\"infrared renormalons\") of the perturbation series for the shape function.5), 13) Guided by such\nconstraints, one would construct ans\u00e4tze for the shape function, and eventually fit them to\nexperimental data to fix the remaining uncertainties.18), 19)\nIn attempting to reach this goal, it is desirable to analyze the operator structure of the\nshape function in QCD and clarify the maximal model-independent constraints among the\nmatrix elements of the relevant operators. However, a systematic study for this purpose has\nnot yet been carried out. In this paper, we discuss a systematic operator analysis for the\nshape function. Our approach is based on the exact identity for the bilocal heavy-quark\noperator, which we derive from the QCD equations of motion and heavy-quark symmetry.\nCombined with the light-cone expansion of the bilocal operator to separate the longitudinalmomentum dependence from transverse one, it is possible to derive a differential equation\nthat controls the longitudinal-momentum dependence of the shape function. We find that\nthe corresponding differential equation involves the \"source terms\" given by matrix elements\nof a finite set of higher-dimensional nonlocal operators. Those nonlocal operators represent\nthe \"kinetic energy distribution\" of the b-quark inside the B-meson and the four-parton\ncorrelations with additional quarks and gluons. Solving this differential equation, we express the shape function in terms of those nonlocal operators that explicitly represent the\nnonperturbative effects relevant for the shape function.\nWhen deriving the differential equation from the exact operator identity, and also when\nsolving the differential equation, we need to specify the boundary conditions for the shape\nfunction. In this paper, we employ the boundary conditions that the (non-negative) moments\nof the shape function as a function of the longitudinal momentum are finite. These conditions\nare equivalent to assuming that the nonlocal operators relevant to the shape function are\nthe generating functions of the corresponding local operators via the Taylor expansion, and\nhold trivially when ignoring renormalization effects.\u2217) However, recent results for the oneloop renormalization of the shape function in the MS scheme claim that the renormalization\neffects completely modify the mathematical properties as well as the physical interpretation\nof the shape function. In particular, a \"radiative tail\" is generated for the momentum\nrepresentation of the shape function, so that all non-negative moments become ultra-violet\nIt is well known that similar conditions are satisfied by the structure functions in the DIS, and that\nthey are preserved by including the radiative corrections.23)\u201326)\n\u2217)\n\n3\n\n\f(UV) divergent.7), 8), 13), 14) Because of this, the differential equation for the shape function\nand its solution discussed in this paper are exact up to the strong renormalization effects\nof order \u03b1s . However, it is important to emphasize that actually our results are useful\nand indispensable beyond the lowest order in the perturbative effects, i.e., for obtaining\nthe total behavior of the renormalized shape function: As noted in Refs. 7), 8), 13), the\nstrong UV behavior in the renormalization effects implies that, for a consistent treatment\nand interpretation, the renormalized shape function should be further \"factorized\" into the\n\"hard components\" involving the radiative corrections and the \"soft components\" involving\nall the nonperturbative effects. In the matching calculation to perform this factorization,\nthe first step is to list a basis of operators to describe the relevant soft components. The\nsolution given in the present paper provides a basis of nonlocal operators as well as the\ncorresponding local operator basis, including the four-parton correlation operators that were\npreviously unknown. Furthermore, our solution provides the complete tree-level result for\nthe hard components.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we demonstrate that the\n\nequations of motion and heavy-quark symmetry allow us to express the bilocal heavy-quark\noperator for the shape function in terms of a finite set of higher-dimensional nonlocal operators, which provides a new basis of nonlocal operators representing relevant soft components\nin the shape function. We also derive a corresponding local operator basis in \u00a73, which is\nrelevant when relating the soft components of the shape function to the HQET parameters.\nIn contrast to the previous works,3)\u20135), 13), 16), 17) our local operator basis is composed of an\nincreasing number of operators with increasing dimension; in addition to a few first operators\nwith low dimension, whose matrix elements give the well-known HQET parameters,3), 4), 16)\nwe find \"new\" operators with higher dimensions, whose matrix elements provide the \"generalized\" HQET parameters that represent the \"Fermi motion\" of the b-quark as well as the\nfour-parton correlation effects inside the B-meson. We also discuss simple estimates of some\nof these generalized HQET parameters and novel effects of the quark-gluon correlations. In\n\u00a74 we derive an explicit formula for the momentum representation of the shape function. Although this formula is subject to modification due to large radiative corrections, it deserves\nconsideration, because it expresses the \"Fermi motion\" of the b-quark in an explicit analytic\nform and the four-parton correlation effects in an integral representation. In \u00a75 we present\n\nour conclusions.\n\n4\n\n\f\u00a72. Nonlocal HQET operators and equations of motion\nThe factorization formulae for the decay spectrum in the inclusive B-meson decays are\nproved with the two-step matching, i.e., matching QCD onto SCET at a scale \u223c mb , followed\np\nby matching SCET onto HQET at a scale \u223c mb \u039bQCD .5)\u20139) The shape function is introduced\n\nat the second step by integrating out the final-state light-quark jet associated with the mass\np\nscale mb \u039bQCD , and it is defined as the B-meson matrix element of a gauge-invariant,\nbilocal light-cone operator in the HQET:3)\u20136)\n\nhB\u0304(v)|h\u0304v (z)[z, 0]hv (0)|B\u0304(v)i = f \u0303(t) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9ei\u03c9t f (\u03c9) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere z \u03bc denotes a light-like vector, z 2 = 0, v \u03bc is the 4-velocity of the B-meson (v 2 = 1), and\nt = v*z.

The\nfunctions f \u0303(t) and f (\u03c9) give the coordinate and (residual) momentum representations of the\nshape function, respectively. Due to the heavy-quark spin symmetry, there appears no other\nindependent function by taking matrix elements of the bilocal operators with other Dirac\nmatrices inserted.\nActually, the shape function (2.1) depends on the scale \u03bc at which the nonlocal light-cone\np\noperator is renormalized ( mb \u039bQCD & \u03bc & \u039bQCD ). It is known that the radiative corrections induce a Sudakov-type strong scale dependence on (2.1), governed by the corresponding\ncusp anomalous dimension,5), 13)\u201315) and, corresponding to this effect, f \u0303(t) in the MS scheme\nbecomes singular for short distances: f \u0303(0), as well as all derivatives of f \u0303(t) at t = 0, diverge.\nAs discussed in \u00a71, however, such singular UV behavior can be factorized from the \"soft\ncomponents\" of the shape function by an additional matching procedure, and we can ignore\nthe renormalization in order to disentangle the operator structure relevant for the soft components. Therefore, in the following, we work with \"naive\" mathematical properties for (2.1)\nthat are valid at lowest order in the perturbative effects, e.g., that f \u0303(0) = 1, and that f \u0303(t)\n5\n\n\fcan be Taylor expanded about t = 0. With these boundary conditions, the physical meaning\nof f (\u03c9) is that it is the distribution of the residual momentum k + = \u03c9v + of the heavy quark\ninside the B-meson.\u2217) A similar approach has been employed in Refs. 5) and 13) to analyze a\nfew first local operators in the Taylor expansion of h\u0304v (z)hv (0) about z\u03bc = 0, considering the\nsmall t expansion of f \u0303(t). Our approach corresponds to an extension of the analysis given in\nRefs. 5) and 13) by treating the relevant nonlocal operator h\u0304v (z)hv (0) directly. Although this\nis formally equivalent to treating all local operators in the Taylor expansion of h\u0304v (z)hv (0)\nsimultaneously, our nonlocal operator approach has the advantage of making the operator\nstructure for the soft components of the shape function most transparent.\nWe can utilize the nonlocal operator technique, which has been developed for analyzing\nthe (higher twist) nucleon structure functions23)\u201326) (see also Refs. 28) and 29)\u2217) ). The\nnonperturbative dynamics of the b-quark, surrounded by the light quarks, antiquarks, and\ngluons, reveals itself as the response of the nonlocal operator h\u0304v (z)hv (0) to the change of the\ninterquark separation and/or total translation, but the total translation is irrelevant for the\nforward matrix elements. The relevant response of the nonlocal operator is described by the\nexact operator identity\nZ 1\n\u2190\n\u03bc \u2202\nh\u0304v (x)hv (0) = h\u0304v (x)v * D hv (0) + i\nduu h\u0304v (x)gG\u03bc\u03bd (ux)v \u03bc x\u03bd hv (0) ,\n(2.3)\nv\n\u2202x\u03bc\n0\n\u2190\n\n\u2190\n\nwhere x\u03bc is not restricted on the light cone. D \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc +igA\u03bc and D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc are the\ncovariant derivatives, and G\u03bc\u03bd = (i/g)[D\u03bc , D\u03bd ] is the gluon field strength tensor. Taking the\nB-meson matrix element of the relation (2.3), the first term on the RHS vanishes, due to\n\u2190\n\nthe HQET equations of motion h\u0304v v * D = 0. We take the light-cone limit, x\u03bc \u2192 z\u03bc ; for the\ncalculation of the LHS, we actually need to extend the definition (2.1) to the case in which\nthe interquark separation is not light-like, where we have\nhB\u0304(v)|h\u0304v (x)hv (0)|B\u0304(v)i = f \u0303(v * x) + x2 F\u0303 (v * x) + O(x4 ) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhile, for the second term on the RHS, we introduce a three-parton correlation function\nR\u0303(t, u) as\n\u0012\n\u0013h\ni\nx2\n1\n\u03bd\nx\u03bc \u2212\nv\u03bc R\u0303(t, u) + O(x2 ) .\n(2.5)\nhB\u0304(v)|h\u0304v (x) gG\u03bc\u03bd (ux) x hv (0)|B\u0304(v)i =\n2\nv*x\n\nThen we obtain the following constraint equation due to the equations of motion:\nZ 1\ndf \u0303(t)\ni\n+ 2tF\u0303 (t) = t\ndu u R\u0303(t, u) .\n(2.6)\ndt\n2 0\n\nActually, the validity of this \"probabilistic interpretation\" appears to be critical, due to nonperturbative as well as perturbative effects. (See the discussion in \u00a7\u00a74 and 5 below.)\n\u2217)\nA similar extension has been employed for the B-meson light-cone wavefunctions.27)\n\u2217)\n\n6\n\n\fThis equation is formally similar to the corresponding differential equations for the twist-3\nnucleon structure functions,26) but an important difference is the participation of F\u0303 (t) in\n(2.6), which expresses the effect due to the deviation from the light-cone, as in (2.4). For\nthe nucleon case, contributions of this type correspond to twist-4 effects and decouple from\nthe equations at the twist-3 level, because the twist defined as \"dimension minus spin\" of\nthe relevant operators is a good quantum number. Although the twist counting of the shape\nfunction (2.1) would be twist-3, such a \"conventional\" twist is no longer a useful concept in\nthe HQET.\nIt is straightforward to see that the insertion of an arbitrary Dirac matrix \u0393 into (2.3)(2.4) does not lead to a new equation for f \u0303(t). This is unlike the case for the B-meson\nwavefunctions,27) and it is due to so strong constraints on the forward matrix elements\nimposed by the heavy-quark spin symmetry.\nTo proceed, we analyze the explicit operator structure of F\u0303 (t) in (2.6), which can be\nextracted from the next-to-leading term in the light-cone expansion of the nonlocal operator\nh\u0304v (x)hv (0) [see (2.4)]. For this purpose, we utilize an elegant method to construct the lightcone expansion:23), 24), 29) The leading term (lt) in the light-cone expansion, corresponding to\nthe leading twist operator in the DIS, obeys the equation\n\u0003\n\u22022 \u0002\nh\u0304\n(x)h\n(0)\n=0,\nv\nv\nlt\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhich ensures that all local operators arising in the Taylor expansion are traceless.

To separate contributions of different powers in x2 , it is convenient to exploit the lightcone expansion of exp(i\u03c9v * x) entering into the definition of the momentum representation\nof f \u0303(v * x),24), 29)\nZ\n\u0002 i\u03c9v*x \u0003\n\u03c9 2 x2 1\ni\u03c9v*x\ne\n= e\n\u2212\nduueiu\u03c9v*x + O(x4 ) ,\n(2.10)\nlt\n4\n0\n7\n\n\fwhere [ei\u03c9v*x ]lt is defined by a straightforward generalization of the procedure [. . .]lt of (2.8)\nto an arbitrary function of x. Substituting (2.9)-(2.10) into (2.4) and comparing both sides\nof the resulting equation, the leading terms reproduce the definition (2.1), and we get, from\nthe next-to-leading O(x2 ) terms,\n1\nF\u0303 (t) =\n4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\nduu\u03a6\u0303(ut) +\n4\n\nwith\n\u03a6\u0303(t) = hB\u0304(v)|\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd\u03c9\u03c9 f (\u03c9)\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nduueiu\u03c9t ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n.\n\n(2.12)\n\n0\n\n\u22022\nh\u0304v (x)hv (0)|B\u0304(v)i\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc\n\nx\u2192z\n\nHere, the second term on the RHS of (2.11) is the analogue of Nachtmann's correction in the\nDIS. An important point is that this term depends on f (\u03c9), and it produces an additional\nterm involving f \u0303(t) in (2.6). Substituting (2.11) into (2.6), we obtain\ndf \u0303(t)\n+ f \u0303(t) \u2212 1 = t2\nt\ndt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u0010\n\ndu u iR\u0303(t, u) \u2212 \u03a6\u0303(ut)\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(2.13)\n\nHere the RHS involves \u03a6\u0303 of (2.12), which is concerned with the effects of the transverse\nas well as longitudinal motion of the b-quark inside the B-mesons.

Substituting (2.14) into\n\u2190\n\u2190\n\u2190\n\u2190\n(2.12), the replacement D \u03bc \u2192D\u22a5\u03bc \u2261D \u03bc \u2212v\u03bc v * D can be made in the first term on the RHS\n\nby using the equations of motion for the effective heavy-quark field. Similarly, the equations\n\u0001\nP\nv\u03bd h\u0304v ta hv + q\u0304ta \u03b3\u03bd q , with the summation\nof motion for the gluons imply [D \u03bc , G\u03bc\u03bd ] = \u2212gta\nP\n( ) over the heavy (hv ) and light (q) flavors. Therefore, (2.12) can be expressed in terms\nof a set of many-body nonlocal operators. This pattern is similar to that for the twist-4\neffects in the DIS,23), 24) but one important difference is that the covariant derivative for the\n\ntransverse direction, D\u22a5\u03bc , acting on the quark fields cannot be completely eliminated in the\npresent case; participation of such a transverse derivative in a complete set of the higherdimensional operators is typical of the HQET.20), 21) In fact, the corresponding operator in\n\u2217)\n\nA similar identity for the case of the light quarks is discussed in Ref. 29).\n\n8\n\n\f(2.14) plays an important role in describing the Fermi motion effects in the B-mesons, as we\nshow below.\nThe matrix element of the derivative of the three-body operator in (2.14) can be calculated using (2.5). An important observation is that this contribution cancels the first term\niR\u0303(t, u) on the RHS of (2.13), so that the three-parton correlation R\u0303 decouples from our\ndifferential equation.

Fermi motion and four-parton correlation effects\nIn this section we derive an explicit formula for the momentum representation of the\nshape function, which is exact up to perturbative O(\u03b1s ) corrections. Although this formula\nsuffers from (large) perturbative corrections, it is useful for obtaining some insight into\nthe relevant nonperturbative effects, the Fermi motion of the b-quark, and the four-parton\ncorrelation effects, without recourse to the t-expansion as in (3.1). For this purpose, we\nderive the Fourier transformation of (2.19) into the residual momentum representation [see\n \u0303 Clearly, the first term, \u03b4(\u03c9), reflects\n(2.1)]. We obtain f (\u03c9) = \u03b4(\u03c9) + [contribution from J].\nthe lack of heavy-quark motion inside the B-mesons in the \"non-interacting limit\", and\nthe above decomposition of f (\u03c9) into the \"free\" term \u03b4(\u03c9) and the \"interaction-dependent\"\ncontribution from J \u0303 would be unsuitable to treat the nonperturbative part in the shape\nfunction. In order to avoid such an \"artificial\" singularity, we rearrange the terms in (2.19).\nActually, it is more convenient to make the corresponding rearrangement in our differential\nequation (2.13) by moving a certain term from the \"source\" on the RHS to the LHS, and\nthen solve the resulting equation with the new source. We decompose K\u0303(t) in (2.18) as [see\n(2.15)]\nK\u0303(t) = \u03c3 2 f \u0303(t) + \u03b4 K\u0303(t) ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe identity between matrix elements of the local operators, which is implied by (3.9) with n = 4\nand (3.10), would be subject to the perturbative O(\u03b1s ) corrections, but these corrections do not affect this\nsimple estimate.\n\u2217\u2217)\nFor the regions with mb \u226b 1/t, these power corrections are enhanced compared with the usual subleading corrections, which are suppressed by powers of \u039bQCD /mb .32) Physically, this corresponds to the situation\nin which the decay spectra in the endpoint region is smeared over a range \u2206 with mb \u226b \u2206 & \u039bQCD .7), 9)\n\u2217\u2217\u2217)\nFor recent progress in treating matrix elements of B-mesons in lattice QCD, see, e.g., Ref. 33).\n\u2217)\n\n12\n\n\fand move the first term with the constant \u03c3 2 to the LHS of (2.13). The residual term \u03b4 K\u0303(t)\nis treated as a source term. The explicit form of the residual term reads\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u2190\n2\n2\n(4.2)\n\u03b4 K\u0303(t) = hB\u0304(v)|h\u0304v (z) (D\u22a5\u03bc ) \u2212 \u03c3 hv (0)|B\u0304(v)i .\n\nThe rearrangement using (4.1) is motivated by the observation that the first term is special\namong the terms on the RHS of (2.18): Among the nonlocal operators of (2.15)-(2.17)\ncontributing to (2.18), the operator for K\u0303(t) has the lowest mass dimension, and it is expected\n\nto play a dominant role. In fact, only this contribution is of a bilocal nature as (2.15), as\nin the case of the shape-function operator (2.1), while the other contributions come from\ngenuine many-body operators. Noting the properties of the higher twist nucleon structure\nfunctions in the DIS,30) we conjecture that multi-parton correlation effects with increasing\nnumbers of partons are less important. We note that the operator for K\u0303(t) is a nonlocal\nversion of the kinetic energy operator of (3.7), and it should be relevant to the Fermi motion\nof the b-quark inside the B-meson; in (4.1) we have extracted the part proportional to f \u0303(t)\nfrom K\u0303(t) on the basis of the fact that K\u0303(t) and f \u0303(t) have similar bilocal natures, and thus\n\u03c3 would eventually correspond to the \"average measure\" of the transverse quark motion,\nas \u03c3 2 \u223c \u2212\u03bb1 [note that K\u0303(0) = \u2212\u03bb1 ].

For both functions, the variable \u03c9 has the physical meaning of the residual light-cone momentum carried\nby the b-quark. The quantity \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 for W (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032) represents the light-cone momentum carried by the gluon or the light q q\u0304-pair, while \u03be \u2212 \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03be for Y (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032, \u03be) represent the\n\nlight-cone momenta carried by the gluons. By inserting a complete set of states between\nthe constituent fields, we also get the support property: W (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032), as well as Y (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032, \u03be),\nvanishes unless \u03c9 < \u039b\u0304 and \u03c9 \u2032 < \u039b\u0304. Similarly, we deduce that \u03b4K(\u03c9) is a real function that\n\nvanishes unless \u03c9 < \u039b\u0304. Using these symmetry and support properties of \u03b4K, W and Y , it is\nstraightforward to see that I(\u03c9) of (4.4) vanishes unless \u03c9 < \u039b\u0304.\nWe solve (4.3) with the boundary conditions f (\u03c9) = 0 for \u03c9 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and the normalization\nR\ncondition d\u03c9f (\u03c9) = f \u0303(0) = 1 in the form\n\n(4.9)\n\nf (\u03c9) = f (0) (\u03c9) + f (1) (\u03c9) ,\n\nwhere f (0) (\u03c9) is the solution with the source I(\u03c9) set to zero, while f (1) (\u03c9) denotes the piece\ninduced by I(\u03c9).

The solution (4.9) with (4.10) and (4.11) represents an\nexplicit formula for the shape function, which satisfies the HQET equations of motion exactly.\nWe note that, if we take the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0, we get f (0) (\u03c9) \u2192 \u03b4(\u03c9), so that (4.10) and (4.11)\nwould reduce to the \"singular\" decomposition of f (\u03c9) without the rearrangement using (4.1).\nTherefore, (4.10) involves a nonperturbative effect represented by the parameter \u03c3, which\n\u221a\nsmears the singular behavior of \u03b4(\u03c9). If we choose, e.g., \u03c3 = \u2212\u03bb1 , the corresponding effect\n14\n\n\fwould be interpreted as the Fermi motion effect of the b-quark inside the B-meson. This\nchoice can be useful in practice, because, in the coordinate representation, we have\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221e\nX\nsin\n\u2212\u03bb\nt\nt2k \u03bbk1\n1\n(0)\n \u0303\n\u221a\nf (t) \u221a\n=\n,\n(4.12)\n=1+\n\u03c3= \u2212\u03bb1\n(2k)!(2k\n+\n1)\n\u2212\u03bb1 t\nk=1\nand the expansion on the RHS reproduces the first three terms of (3.1) exactly [see (3.6),\nand note that f \u0303(1) (t) \u221a\n= it3 W0,0 /36 + O(t4 )]. In fact, \"flat distribution\" (4.10) with\n\u03c3=\n\u2212\u03bb\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c3 = \u2212\u03bb1 exhibits behavior consistent with the Gaussian distribution around \u03c9 = 0 with\n\u221a\nthe width \u2212\u03bb1 , which was proposed in Refs. 5) and 13) as a nonperturbative ansatz valid\n\u221a\nin the vicinity of \u03c9 = 0. As an alternative to the choice \u03c3 = \u2212\u03bb1 , one may employ another\n\"optimized\" choice for \u03c3, which makes \u03b4 K\u0303(t) of (4.2) \"small\", so that \u03b4 K\u0303(t) could be treated\nas a perturbation.\nIt is well known that (2.1) should obey f (\u03c9) = 0 for \u03c9 > \u039b\u0304.3), 4), 16) Using the abovementioned support property for I(\u03c9), it is straightforward to show that our solution (4.9)\nindeed vanishes unless \u03c9 < \u039b\u0304,\u2217) reproducing the correct support property.\nOur solution reveals that the shape function is subject to nonperturbative effects due\nto the multi-parton correlation with additional quarks and gluons, which are represented\nby W (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032) and Y (\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032, \u03be), as in (4.11), (4.4). This indicates that f (\u03c9) is actually a\ncomplicated multi-particle object beyond a \"simple\" momentum distribution function. This\nis in contrast to the leading-twist nucleon structure functions in the DIS, but it is reminiscent\nof the character of the higher-twist ones.23), 25), 26) Our results, (4.11) and (4.4), are exact\nto lowest order in the perturbative effects, but the multi-particle character of f (\u03c9) should\npersist when perturbative corrections are included.\n\u00a75. Conclusion\nThe shape function of the B-meson is an important ingredient in the factorization formula of the differential rates of inclusive B-meson decays, such as B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 and B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304.\nWe studied the \"soft components\" of the shape function separately from the \"hard (perturbative) components\" relevant to its scale dependence, and we studied the model-independent\nconstraints on the soft components in the heavy quark limit. From the equations of motion\nand heavy-quark symmetry constraints, we derived a differential equation that relates the\nlongitudinal-momentum dependence of the shape function to matrix elements of the novel\nnonlocal operators. Solving this equation, we obtained a new basis of nonlocal operators,\nwhich describes the relevant soft components of the shape function in terms of the kinetic\n\u2217)\n\nThis is actually satisfied even in the case \u03c3 > \u039b\u0304, as well as for \u03c3 \u2264 \u039b\u0304.\n\n15\n\n\fenergy distribution and the four-parton correlations. We also derived the relations among\nthe matrix elements of local operators with arbitrary numbers of covariant derivatives. These\nrelations not only reproduce all the known results for a few covariant derivatives but also\ninclude new relations for more covariant derivatives. These relations are exact only when\nwe ignore the perturbative effects, but they are useful beyond the lowest order in the perturbative effects for the purpose of finding a basis of independent local operators with the\nsame dimension. Our relations indicate that the local operator basis is composed of an\nincreasing number of operators with increasing dimensions whose matrix elements give the\ngeneralized HQET parameters that represent the Fermi motion of the b-quark as well as the\nfour-parton correlation effects inside the B-meson. Our differential equation also yields the\nmomentum representation f (\u03c9) as a sum of the part f (0) (\u03c9) involving the Fermi motion and\nthe additional part f (1) (\u03c9) induced by more sophisticated correlation effects. The behavior\nof the \"leading\" part, f (0) (\u03c9), appears to be consistent with the existing nonperturbative\nansatz5), 13) for the shape function. Our momentum-representation formula is again exact\nup to perturbative corrections, but it provides insight into model building of the relevant\nnonperturbative effects.\nOur results reveal that, due to nonperturbative effects, f (\u03c9) is a much more complicated\nobject than the simple momentum distribution of the b-quark inside the B-meson: Nonperturbative effects induce the mixing of additional dynamical quarks and gluons, so that the\nshape function contains the soft components that represent the multi-particle correlation effects. In connection to this, it is interesting to note that a probabilistic interpretation of f (\u03c9)\nas the momentum distribution has been questioned from a different point of view, noting\nR\nthat d\u03c9f (\u03c9) is negatively divergent, due to the perturbative effects in (2.1), as mentioned\n\nin \u00a71.7), 8)\n\nThe \"full\" shape function (2.1) entering into the factorization formula for the inclusive\ndecay rates is obtained by combining the soft components with the hard components through\nthe matching procedure. We emphasize that (3.12) with (3.3)-(3.5) provides a local operator\n\nbasis that is necessary for parameterizing the soft components in the matching calculation.\nFurthermore, (3.1) with (3.2) completes the matching at the tree level for operators of\narbitrary dimension, and the corresponding leading-order matching coefficients can be easily\nread off from this formula. One can proceed to the one-loop matching calculations using\nour operator basis, and the loop effects will produce the mixing coefficients at the next-toleading order between the operators with the same dimension. Also, the nonlocal operator\nbasis provided by (2.15)-(2.17) may be useful, and (2.19) ((4.9) with (4.10) and (4.11))\ncompletes the corresponding leading-order matching in the coordinate (momentum) space.\nUsing the results of the matching calculations, a detailed study of the interplay between\n16\n\n\fthe strong perturbative effects in the hard components, which generate a Sudakov-type\nscale dependence, and the nonperturbative effects in the soft components, which have been\nunraveled in this paper, should clarify the behavior of the full shape function and its roles\nin decay rates. This will be studied in a separate publication.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank T. Onogi and S. Hashimoto for discussions that stimulated this investigation. The work of J.
