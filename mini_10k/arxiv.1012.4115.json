The experimental differential transmission are compared with a dynamical\ncalculation of the momentum-resolved hole distributions, which includes the carrier-carrier, carrierphonon and carrier-impurity interaction at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals. We obtain\ngood agreement with the experimentally determined hole-spin relaxation times, but point out that\ndepending on how the spin-polarization dynamics is extracted, deviations from an exponential decay at short times occur. We also study theoretically the behavior of the spin-relaxation for heavily\np-doped GaAs at low temperatures.\n\nResearch on spin dynamics and spintronics in semiconductors and metals covers an immense variety of applications\nin information storage and manipulation in carrier spins in solid state systems.1\u20133 Both storage and manipulation of\nspins are limited by spin relaxation, so that an understanding of spin relaxation processes is important.4,5 For ultrafast\nspin dependent dynamics on picosecond timescales, simplified relaxation-time approximations are no longer justified\nand a fully microscopic understanding of the complex spin dynamics is needed.6\u20138 While electron spin-dynamics\ncontinue to be extensively investigated in semiconductors due to their extremely long spin-relaxation times,9 holespin dynamics are intriguing for different reasons. In III-V semiconductors, hole dynamics is inherently different\nfrom that of electrons because of the strong spin-orbit coupling of the hole states. Thus, hole-spin relaxation and\nmomentum (energy) relaxation occur on a comparable ultrashort timescale.\nIn this paper, we connect differential transmission measurements of the hole-spin dynamics10 with a microscopic\ncalculation that includes the anisotropic band-structure as well as carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon/impurity scattering mechanisms at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals. Although our approach does not take into account\nall the intricacies of the dynamical multi-band screening (including phonon-plasmon coupling)11,12 and interband\npolarizations, it captures essential aspects of the spin dynamics of holes.13 We show that this calculation compares\nwell with measured hole-spin relaxation times, but that deviations from an exponential spin decay occur for short\ntimes depending on how the relaxation time is extracted. Further, we present results for the hole-spin relaxation at\nhigh p-doping, which underlies a recent treatment of GaAs-based ferromagnetic semiconductors.14\nRecent theoretical treatments of hole spin (and charge) dynamics in bulk GaAs have focused on the calculation of\nenergy-dependent spin relaxation-rates due to phonon/impurity scattering,15 the investigation of coherent hole (spin)\ndynamics in GaAs,16,17 and the influence of Dyakonov-Perel type precession effects due to spin-dependent splittings\nbetween hole bands in GaAs quantum wells.18 Very recently, additional contributions due to \"small\" band structure\neffects and the spin-orbit contribution to the hole-phonon interaction for holes in bulk GaAs have also been analyzed.19\nFrom an experimental point of view, hole-spin polarizations can be created efficiently using optical orientation\ntechniques.20 Because of the ultrashort lifetimes21 involved, it is difficult to unambiguously study hole dynamics\nin degenerate pump-probe experiments (i.e., experiments with the same pump and probe wavelengths) due to the\ncompeting presence of the coherent artifact on the same timescale22 and, to a lesser degree, the electron spin dynamics.9\nHole spin study, therefore, requires measurement of the spin-dependent carrier dynamics on ultrashort timescales\nusing a time-delayed, mid-infrared probe beam (i.e., a nondegenerate pump-probe experiment), which was realized\nonly much later10 than similar experiments on electrons.9\nWe focus here on the dynamics of the spin-polarized heavy hole subband. We have performed nondegenerate,\npolarization-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy at 300 K to measure the hole spin relaxation lifetime in intrinsic\nGaAs as a function of input pump fluence, F . In this setup, 1 W of average power from an 80 fs titanium:sapphire\nlaser (Spectra Physics Tsunami) operating at an 80 MHz repetition rate is used to pump a custom-designed optical\nparametric oscillator based on periodically-poled lithium niobate, as described in further detail in ref. 23. A portion of\nthe titanium:sapphire beam (\u2264 300 mW) is circularly polarized using a quarter wave plate and is used to photoexcite\nspin-polarized electron-hole pairs in the GaAs sample. The pump beam induces a circular birefringence and results\nin a time-dependent rotation of the transmitted probe polarization. To isolate the dynamics of the hole spin state\nfrom the electron spin, we probe the occupancy of the heavy hole and/or light hole subbands using a synchronized\nmid-infrared idler pulse (\u03bb = 3200 nm), which probes the induced transitions from the split off subband into the\nheavy hole subband. This wavelength directly probes states from the lower split-off hole subband to the heavy hole\n\n\f2\n0.35\n\n13.8 \u03bcJ cm\u22122, \u03c4s = 0.130 ps\n11.4 \u03bcJ cm\u22122, \u03c4s = 0.135 ps\n\n0.3\n\n8.9 \u03bcJ cm\u22122, \u03c4 = 0.145 ps\ns\n\n\u2206T /T (a.u.)\n\n0.25\n\n6.0 \u03bcJ cm\u22122, \u03c4s = 0.120 ps\n3.8 \u03bcJ cm\u22122, \u03c4s = 0.125 ps\n\n0.2\n\n2.6 \u03bcJ cm\u22122, \u03c4s = 0.130 ps\n\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n\n0\n\n200\n\nDelay(fs)\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nFIG. 1.

The\ninput probe beam is linearly polarized (x\u0302), which is an equal admixture of both the co-circularly polarized (\u03c3\u0302+ ) and\ncounter circularly polarized(\u03c3\u0302\u2212 ). A MgF2 linear polarizer is rotated 90\u25e6 with respect to the input polarization (i.e.,\nalong \u0177) and is used to measure the field rotation of the transmitted probe, which depends on the time-dynamics of\nthe the heavy hole occupancy state near the quasimomentum, k, of photogeneration. Using the measured absorption\ncoefficient of GaAs,24 the resulting carrier concentrations range from 5\u00d71016 cm\u22123 (F = 2.6 \u03bcJ cm\u22122 ) to 2\u00d71017 cm\u22123\n(F = 13.8 \u03bcJ cm\u22122 ). We fit the measured field rotation to a single exponential model and account for the finite pump\nand probe pulse widths by convolving the model function with a gaussian with a width of 120 fs (see ref. 10 for more\ndetails of the fitting model). We find no significant trend in the extracted lifetimes, which range from 120 fs to 145 fs,\nwithin the experimental error (\u00b120%) of this experiment.\nThe calculation of the hole-spin dynamics follow the procedure outlined in ref. 13. The electron and hole states\naround the fundamental bandgap needed as input for the dynamical calculation are determined from an 8-band Kane\nmodel H(~k) with six hole and two electron bands containing terms up to second order in k.25 By diagonalizing H(~k)\nwe obtain the \"intelligent basis\" (in the sense of ref. 26) for the hole states: |\u03bd, ~ki and their energy eigenvalues \u03b5\u03bd,~k .\nThe label \u03bd = (b, p) includes the band index b = E, HH, LH, SOH, (for electrons, heavy holes, light holes, and split-off\nholes) and the pseudospin p = 1, 2. The pseudospin can be introduced because the quasiparticle dispersions of all\nfour types of carriers are (nearly) doubly degenerate.\nThe dynamical equations governing the time evolution of the incoherent carrier distributions, n\u03bd,~k , under the\ninfluence of optical fields and scattering are:13,27\n\u2202\nn ~ = \u0393in\n(1 \u2212 n\u03bd,~k ) \u2212 \u0393out\nn k\n\u03bd,~\nk\n\u03bd,~\nk \u03bd,~\n\u2202t \u03bd,k\n\n(1)\n\n(plus a contribution from the optical excitation, which neglects the hole band coherences between hole states of the\n\"intelligent basis,\" or, equivalently, only describes contributions to the hole spin relaxation of the Elliott type26 that\narise from the ~k dependent mixing of different spins in the states |\u03bd, ~ki. Contributions to the spin relaxation via\ncoherent spin precession,i.e., Dyakonov-Perel-type spin dynamics,19 are neglected.\nThe dynamical in-scattering rate consists of the carrier-carrier interaction contribution (i.e., eq.

There is also a contribution similar to eq.

The anisotropies and high-dimensional scattering integrals result in a challenging numerical problem.\nWe incorporate the effects of the anisotropy by expanding n\u03bd,~k (t) into spherical harmonics Yl,m (k\u0302) up to order l = 4\nand retain only the expansion coefficients with radial or cubic symmetry, as these are the dominant symmetries of\nthe Hamiltonian H.25 This procedure, together with the use of static screening, v s (q) = e2 /[\u01eb0 \u01ebbg (q 2 + \u03ba2 )], reduces\nthe numerical complexity. Additional simplifications are achieved by including only the heavy-hole bands in the\ndynamical calculation as the number of optically excited light holes is much smaller,13 and by replacing the nonequilibrium electron distributions by equilibrium distributions with the lattice temperature. We then calculate the\nspin polarization of the HH band. In ref. 13, it was shown that the spin polarization is not identical to the DT signal\nthat is measured, but the deviations are small enough for the accuracy of the present comparison.\nWe include the carrier excitation by an ultrashort optical pulse using a \u03c3\u0302+ polarized plane wave traveling in the\n(001) direction (\u1e91) to generate an initial condition for the carrier distributions\nX\n~ 2 g(~\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5 ~ \u2212 \u03b5 ~ ) .\nn\u03bd,~k (t = 0) =\n|d~\u03bc\u03bd (~k) * E|\n(3)\n\u03bc,k\n\u03bd,k\n\u03bc\n\n~ is the laser field, and ~\u03c9 is the photon energy of the\nHere, d~\u03bc\u03bd (~k) = eh\u03bc, ~k|~r|\u03bd, ~ki are the dipole-matrix \u0001elements, E\n\u0001\nexciting field.

Fig. 2 shows\nthat hole spin-relaxation is rather insensitive to excited carrier densities on the order of 1017 cm\u22123 . The calculation\nalso predicts a very weak temperature dependence with a hole spin relaxation time of 250 fs for an excited density of\n1017 cm\u22123 at 4 K, which is somewhat shorter than the result predicted by the Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation-time.15\nIn Fig. 3, we simulate the momentum dependence of the spin polarization dynamics. We model the excitation by\nan 800 nm pump pulse that excites a carrier density of 1017 cm\u22123 . This leads to anisotropic initial hole distributions\nthat are peaked at momentum k = 0.3 nm\u22121 (after integration over the angular variables). Fig. 3 shows different spin\npolarizations calculated using the angle-averaged distributions n(k, t) for different modulus of the hole momentum k.\nThe decay of the spin polarization near the peak position of the initial distribution is nearly exponential, as can be\nseen from the linear curve shape on the logarithmic scale. The evolution of the spin polarization for larger and smaller\nmomenta (i.e, away from the momenta of the initially photoexcited holes) is significantly faster and non-exponential\nfor the initial \u223c 100 fs. After the initial non-exponential dynamics the spin-relaxation becomes exponential again with\nthe same time constant. The spin relaxation-time therefore depends on the way it is extracted from the calculation,\nas opposed to the case of electron spin-relaxation in p-doped GaAs where the spin relaxation time can be quite\nrigorously defined.29 The dashed lines in Fig. 3 correspond to experimental situations where pump and probe pulses\nare detuned, as was investigated in ref. 10 (see Fig. 5 therein), where no change in spin relaxation times for different\ndetuning between pump and probe pulses was found. The apparent discrepancy likely results from the analysis of the\nexperimental data via a convolution of Gaussians, which are used to describe both the pulse shapes and the dynamics\nof the material response. The analysis of the pump-probe experiment therefore presupposed an exponential decay of\nthe polarization, which turns out to be only somewhat longer than the experimental time resolution of about 100 fs10 .\n\n\f4\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nNormalized Polarization\n\nk=0.1nm\n\n\u22121\n\nk=0.3nm\n\n(peak)\n\n\u22121\n\nk=0.5nm\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nTime (fs)\n\nFIG. 3.

The dashed line\nresults if only scattering by from ionized donors is included.\n\nFor degenerate pump and probe, this analysis yields the exponential decay of the spin polarization in agreement with\nthe calculated result in Fig. 3. For non-degenerate situations the non-exponential features in Fig. 3 on timescales\nbelow 100 fs are not resolved. Their resolution would require a time resolution well below 100 fs.\nFinally, we examine the hole-spin relaxation dynamics in heavily p-doped GaAs at low temperatures (5 K) theoretically. By choosing these parameters, we estimate the hole-spin relaxation time for GaMnAs in the ferromagnetic\nphase at low temperatures, which has similar carrier doping levels. We model the optical excitation of nonequilibrium\ncarriers in p-doped GaAs by a pump laser with a wavelength of 400 nm. Choosing this wavelength ensures that the\noptical transitions are not blocked by holes even for very high doping densities. We assume initial carrier distributions\nof the form n0k = ndop\n+ nexc\nk , which contain both the influence of the doping and the optical excitation. All itinerant\nk\nholes introduced by the p-doping are assumed to be thermalized at the lattice temperature; they are modeled by\nunpolarized Fermi-Dirac electron distributions ndop = f (\u01ebek ) at lattice temperature with carrier density equal to the\ndensity of dopants. For the optical excitation we assume again an ultrashort pulse with a width of 15 meV. Fig. 4\nshows that the hole-spin relaxation drops to approximately 10 fs for doping densities typical for GaAs based magnetic\nsemiconductors. At these high doping densities, the rapid momentum relaxation due to scattering from the ionized\ndonors provides the main relaxation mechanism. The assumption of a hole spin relaxation time of \u223c10 fs in ref. 14\nmakes it possible to neglect a spin-bottleneck effect for ferromagnetic GaMnAs. Our results, based on a dynamical\ncalculation, support this assumption.\n\n\f5\nIn conclusion we examined ultrafast hole-spin relaxation using differential transmission measurements and a microscopic theoretical approach for different excitation conditions. Theory and experiment show that the hole-spin\nrelaxation time is approximately 100 fs and independent of moderate changes of the pump fluence at room temperature. The concept of spin-relaxation time is not, in general, applicable for non-degenerate pump-probe schemes,\nbut the deviations from the exponential decay of the spin-polarization are confined to time scales of less than 100 fs,\nand can therefore only be resolved by a time resolution well below 100 fs. These results also demonstrate the limited\nvalidity of a single spin relaxation-time for holes. Strong p-type doping shortens relaxation times significantly due to\nthe scattering from ionized donors. The calculated spin relaxation times support the assumption of very fast hole-spin\nrelaxation in ferromagnetic GaMnAs at low temperatures.\nWe acknowledge support by the DFG through GRK 792 and a grant for CPU time from the the NIC J\u00fclich.
