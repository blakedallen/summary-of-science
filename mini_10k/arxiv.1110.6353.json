O'Farrell\nDedicated to Paul Gauthier\nAbstract. An element g of a group is called reversible if it is conjugate in the\ngroup to its inverse. In this paper we review some results about the structure\nof groups involving the reversible elements and we pose some questions about\ngroups associated to a Banach algebra.\n\n1. Introduction\nDefinition 1.1. An element g of a group is called reversible if it is conjugate\nin the group to its inverse, i.e. there exists some map h, belonging to the group,\nsuch that the conjugate g h = h\u22121 gh equals g \u22121 . We say that h reverses g, in this\ncase.\nThis concept had its origins in the study of dynamical systems [Bir15]. Classical conservative systems such as the harmonic oscillator and a system of n bodies\nmoving under their mutual (Newtonian) gravitational attraction, and billiards (on\na table without pockets or corners!) have what is called a time-reversal symmetry:\na bijection of the phase space which conjugates the dynamical system to its inverse.\nI became interested in reversibility because I encountered reversible dynamical\nsystems when studying a number of different problems related to approximation:\n\u2022 Approximation by functions of the form F (x, y) = f (x)+ g(y) on compact\nsets in R2 [MO79, MO83].\n\u2022 Approximation by polynomials of the form p(z 2 , z\u0304 2 + z\u0304 3 ) on a disk in the\ncomplex plane [OSG02].\nI was not the first to find that an apparently undynamical problem had an essential\nconnection to some discrete dynamical system. In fact, this phenomenon has been\nnamed hidden dynamics by V.I. Arnold [Vor81]. Other problems of this type are:\n\u2022 Biholomorphic classification of a pair of tangent real-analytic arcs in the\nplane [AG05, Kas15, Nak98, Vor81, Vor82].\n\u2022 The polynomial hull of a disk having an isolated complex tangent [MW83,\nSG00].\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

O'FARRELL\n\nEach of these problems involves a pair of non-commuting involutions, and so\nrelates to a reversible element in some group of maps. Moreover, it turned out that\nthis connection to dynamics provided the key to resolving the problem.\nWith this in mind, I decided to come at the phenomenon from the other end,\nand to try to understand the phenomenon of reversibility in general. The natural\ncontext is the theory of groups, and I have been calculating examples, assembling\nwhat is known from the literature, and encouraging people to examine reversibility\nin their favourite groups. In fact, it turns out that there is a gigantic literature on reversibility in various different groups. Much of this falls into islands (or continents)\nof work, where the workers are unaware of the connection between this aspect of\ntheir field and of other fields. The work cuts right across the various fields of mainstream mathematics. See [AR95b, BR97, BR01, BR03, BR06, Bri96, Bul88,\nDev76, Djo67, GM03, GM04, Gon96, Goo99, Gow75, HK58, Kan01,\nLam92, LRC93, LR98, QC89, Rad81, Sar07, Sev86, Web96, Web98,\nWon66], and further references therein and below.\nIn this short paper, I review some results about reversibility and particularly\nfactorisation into reversible factors, and pose some questions about groups related\nto Banach algebras, specifically.\nI have drawn upon material in the draft of a book on aspects of reversibility\nthat is in preparation with Ian Short, and wish to acknowledge his help with this.\n2. Notation\nLet G be a group. We use the following notation:\nI = I(G) := {f \u2208 G : f 2 = id} - the set of involutions of G (including the\nidentity, id).\nRf = Rf (G) := {h \u2208 G : f h = f \u22121 } (where f h = h\u22121 f h) -the set of reversers\nof f .\nR = R(G) := {f \u2208 G : Rf 6= \u2205} - the set of reversible\nS\u221e elements.\nFor A \u2282 G, An := {f1 * * * fn : fj \u2208 A}, and A\u221e := n=1 An .\nElements of I 2 are called strongly-reversible. They are reversed by an involution.\nMembership in I n or Rn is a conjugacy invariant, and I 2 \u2282 R.\nI \u221e and R\u221e are normal subgroups of G.\n3. Example: GL(n, C)\nClassification of linear reversible maps on Cn is simple. Suppose F \u2208 GL(n, C)\n(the general linear group over the field C of complex numbers) is reversible. Since\nthe Jordan normal form of F \u22121 consists of blocks of the same size as F with\nreciprocal eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of F that are not \u00b11 must split into groups\nof pairs \u03bb, 1/\u03bb. Furthermore, we must have the same number of Jordan blocks of\neach size for \u03bb as for 1/\u03bb. Vice versa, if the eigenvalues of F are either \u00b11 or split\ninto groups of pairs \u03bb, 1/\u03bb with the same number of Jordan blocks of each size, then\nboth F and F \u22121 have the same Jordan normal form and are therefore conjugate to\neach other.\nIncidentally, each matrix A \u2208 GL(n, C) is mapped to a conjugate of its inverse\nby some outer automorphism of the group. In fact A 7\u2192 (At )\u22121 is an automorphism,\nand At is conjugate to A. There is a wider context concerning \"outer reversibility\"\nin a group.\n\n\fREVERSIBILITY\n\n3\n\n4. The Basic Questions\nIn each group, G, we ask:\n\u2022 Which f are reversible in G?\n\u2022 Which h reverse a given f ?\n\u2022 Describe I \u221e .\n\u2022 Describe R\u221e .\n\u2022 Is I n = I \u221e for some n?\n\u2022 Is Rn = R\u221e for some n?\n\u2022 Does every nonempty Rg have an element of finite order? If so, what\norders occur? Is min{o(h) : h \u2208 Rg } bounded, for g \u2208 R?\nIf g is reversible by some element of finite order, then it is the product of two\nelements of that (even) order. Thus results about Rn , combined with results about\nthe order of reverses, also give information about factorizing elements of G as a\nproduct of elements of at most a given order. Some find this interesting [HOR01].\nWe wish to encourage people to investigate the questions above in their favourite\ngroups. Many groups have been analysed, and in the next section we survey some\nof these results. But many groups remain to be investigated. In the final section,\nwe shall draw particular attention to groups associated to Banach algebras.\n5. Survey of Known Results\nWe now give a summary of some answers, in examples of various categories of\ngroups, with a sampling of relevant sources (by no means complete). Here, G always\ndenotes the group under consideration. We give no detail about the derivation of\nthese results, just references to the related literature. Some of the proofs are quite\ndeep, and they draw on diverse branches of mathematics.\n5.1. If G is abelian, then obviously R = I = I \u221e .\nIf G is free, then it is not hard to see that R = I = {1}.\n5.2. Finite Groups.

We may associate two collections of groups to A.\nIn each case, we ask the usual questions.\n6.1. A\u22121 and its subgroups. Suppose A has identity (or adjoin one, if not)\nand k1k = 1.\nReversibility in A\u22121 is not interesting unless A is noncommutative. Also central\nreversibles are just central involutions, so the real problems are about the quotient\nA\u22121\n\u2261 Inn(A).\nZ(A\u22121 )\nOne interesting subgroup is\nIso(A) = {x \u2208 A : kxk = kx\u22121 k = 1}.\nThis coincides with the subgroup (often denoted sf U (A) [All11]) of unitary elements, in case A is a C \u2217 algebra.\nOne may also focus on the connected component of 1 in either group, G, and\non the intersection G \u2229 E c with the commutator of any subset E \u2282 A.\nOne also has the normal subgroup\n{x \u2208 A : ka \u2212 1k < 1}\u221e , which lies in the group (exp A)\u221e .\nFor instance, Gustafson, Halmos, and Radjavi [GHR76] showed that for finitedimensional (real or complex) Hilbert spaces H, the group G = GL(H) has I 4 = I \u221e ,\nand they noted that for infinite-dimensional H, we have I 4 6= I 7 = GL(H). I don't\nknow whether 7 is the best possible value in that statement. What happens with\nother C \u2217 algebras?\nIt is known that for finite-dimensional GL(H), we have I 2 = R in G, and also\nin the unitary subgroup. What about other C \u2217 algebras?\n6.2. Aut(A) and its subgroups. The main interesting subgroup (apart from\nthe inner automorphism group, already mentioned) is the group of isometric isomorphisms. This is often the same as Aut(A).\nAs an example, when X is a locally-compact Hausdorff space and A = C0 (X, C),\nthen Aut(A) is isomorphic to Homeo(X), so we have seen answers in case X = R1\nand X = S1 . For the disk algebra, the automorphism group is isomorphic to\nPSL(2, R), so all elements are reversible. Similarly, for the polydisk algebra, the\nautomorphism group is isomorphic to the group of conformal automorphisms of the\npolydisk, which is isomorphic to the wreath product Sn \u2240 PSL(2, R), and again all\nelements are reversible.\nWe remark that the algebra of all formal power series in n indeterminates, with\ncomplex coefficients, has a natural Frechet algebra structure, and embeds in some\nBanach algebras [All11]. Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of\nformally-invertible formal germs mentioned already.\nReferences\n[AG05] P. Ahern and X.
