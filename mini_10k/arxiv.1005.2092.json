INTRODUCTION\n\nInterest in the MgB2-based materials for practical application despite the\ncomparatively low superconducting (SC) transition temperature, can be explained on the one\nhand, by the transparency of clean grain boundaries to current [1, 2], and the possibility to\nachieve high critical magnetic fields and critical current densities in polycrystalline material,\nwhich in turn leads to the simpler and cheaper preparation technique (than in the case of\nhigh-temperature superconductors), by aptitude of the materials for both the large scale\napplications and the electronic devices. On the other hand, this interest can be explained by\nthe intensive development of technologies that use liquid hydrogen as an alternative fuel for\nmotors, water and aviation transports as well as for cooling long power transmission lines,\nbecause the boiling temperature of liquid hydrogen (20 K) can be the working temperature\nfor MgB2-based superconductive materials. For the efficient application of MgB2-based\nsuperconductors a further improvement of the in-field Jc is of great importance.\nThere are two classes of properties that can be responsible for the Jc and might be termed\n'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' [3]. According to classification given in [3], intrinsic (i.e.\nintragranular) properties of polycrystalline MgB2 are the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2\nand flux pinning (or, alternatively, intragrain Jc). An enhancement of the extrinsic properties\n(connectivity and porosity) can be attained by substantial across-the-board increases in Jc and\ncan accompany an increase in the effective superconducting cross-sectional area for the\nconduction of transport current. Any kind of disorder potentially changes the MgB2\nsuperconducting properties. Disorder can be introduced in a controlled way by doping or\nirradiation, but often arises from the preparation conditions and generally decreases the\n\n\ftransition temperature. The connections between the grains remain weak, since dirty grain\nboundaries potentially reduce the critical currents. It was concluded that grain boundaries are\nthe dominant pinning centres in thin films, where high critical current densities close to 15%\nof the depairing current density were reached [2]. According to this, the expected maximum\nfor loss-free supercurrents is achieved in the case of the optimized pinning when nanosized\nMgB2 grains provide enough grain boundaries to reach the theoretical limit. The observations\nshow that grain boundary pinning may be dominant in consolidated MgB2 [4]. The bad\nconnectivity between grains reduces the critical currents by a factor of about five in today's\nbest 'high field superconductors'. The anisotropy further suppresses the critical currents at\nhigh magnetic fields and is successfully described by a percolation model. The introduction\nof disorder increases the upper critical field and reduces its anisotropy, leading to higher\ncurrents at high magnetic fields [2].\nThe introduction of dopants can have one or more effects, which may result in an increase\nin the bulk pinning strength [3]: (1) by increasing crystal's Hc2 and Hirr, (2) by forming a wide\ndistribution of point pinning centers and (3) by producing localized lattice strains, which also\ncontribute to flux pinning.\nPressure is of great importance in the manufacture of superconducting MgB2-based\nbulk materials. Pressure allows suppressing a volatility of Mg, impeding its oxidation, and\npromoting the formation of a mechanically stable denser structure. A denser material usually\nexhibits higher superconducting properties; it is more stable against degradation during\nexploitation, less reacts with a moisture, etc. Even in the case of pressureless synthesis (insitu) or sintering (ex-situ) a preliminarily densification (compaction), i.e. pressure treatment,\nplays a great role in attaining high superconducting and mechanical characteristics of the\nproduced materials. Recently the efficiency of high-pressure densification has been shown\nfor wire manufacturing process, in particular [5].\n\n\fDespite the comparatively simple lattice structure of MgB2, to find correlations between\nthe MgB2-based material structural features and its superconducting properties is a very\ncomplicated task. It can be explained by a considerable difficulty that arises from the\nelectronic structure, by the necessity to detect the amount and distribution of light element\nboron, to analyze the boron-containing compounds [6] in nanostructural materials, which are\noften porous and in addition, can easily react with oxygen and hydrogen.\nIn this paper we present the results of studying the structure, superconducting,\nthermophysical, and mechanical properties of the MgB2-based materials prepared by us insitu from Mg and B or ex-situ from MgB2 by different pressure-using techniques: high\npressures (2 GPa), hot pressing (30 MPa), spark plasma sintering (50 MPa), and isostatic\npressing (0.1 GPa) at 600\u20131200 oC. In the describing of correlations between structure and\ncritical current density the emphasis is given to high-pressure synthesized materials (without\nadditions and with addition of Ti, Ta, Zr, SiC) having higher superconducting and\nmechanical properties and high density. The influence of deviation from the stoichiometry of\nMgB2 up to MgB20 in the initial mixture of Mg and B on superconducting properties of highpressure-synthesized materials is considered. The quenching current and AC losses measured\nby inductive methods using rings, cut from materials synthesized at high-pressure and hot\npressing, are presented and analyzed from the point of view of the materials applicability in\ntransformer-type fault current limiters.\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL\n\nSamples were prepared using (1) high pressures, HP, in recessed-anvil high-pressure\napparatuses, , (under 2 GPa) [7], (2) hot pressing, Hot-P, ( under 30 MPa), (3) spark plasma\nsintering, SPS, (under 50 MPa), (4) hot isostatic pressing, HIP, (under 0.1 GPa gas pressure)\n\n\fand (5) pressureless synthesis, PL, (under 0.1 MPa of Ar). In the case of HP, Hot-P, SPS the\ncylindrical or rectangular blocks were produced from a mixture of Mg and B or MgB2 with\nand without additions. In the case of HIP and PL the ring-shaped items were manufactured\nfrom a mixture of Mg and B. The formation of rings were performed using broaching: the\ninitial mixture of powders was compacted between coaxial steel tubes by pushing the broach\ntool inside the hole of the inner steel tube while around the outer steel tube the compressive\npressure was created. During the synthesis or sintering the samples were in contact with\nhexagonal BN (HP, Hot-P), steel (HIP, PL) or graphite (SPS). The synthesis and sintering\nprocesses were studied in the 600\u20131200 oC temperature range. As the initial materials we\nused powders of MgB2 (I) with an average grain size of 10 \u03bcm and 0.8 % of O (H.C. Starck),\nMgB2 (II) of 98 % purity (Alfa Aesar), and MgB2 (III) with an average grain size of 4.2 \u03bcm,\n1.9% of O (H.C. Starck), and several types of amorphous boron: B(I) with grains <5 \u03bcm, 0.66\n% O (H.C. Starck), B(II) (HyperTech, USA), B(III) with grains of 4 \u03bcm, 1.5 % O (H.C.\nStarck), B(IV) of 95-97% purity, grains of 0.8 \u03bcm, 1.7 % of O (MaTecK ), and B(V) 1.4 \u03bcm,\n1.9% O (H.C. Starck); metal magnesium chips (I) (Technical Specifications of Ukraine 4810-93-88), powder of Mg (II) produced by HyperTech (USA), Ti (of size 1-3\uf020\uf06dm, MaTecK,\n99% purity), Ta (technical specifications 95-318-75, 1-3\uf020\uf06dm), Zr (of 2 - 5 \u03bcm, MaTecK, 9498% purity) or SiC (200\u2013800 nm, H.C. Starck). To produce MgB2-based materials, metal\nmagnesium turnings and amorphous boron were taken in the stoichiometric ratio of MgB2.\nTo study the influence of Ta, Zr, Ti or SiC, the powders were added to the stoichiometric\nMgB2 mixture in the amount of 10 wt%. The components were mixed and milled in a highspeed activator with steel balls for 1-3 min and then tabletized. To study the processes of the\nhigher borides formation, Mg and B (III) were taken in the MgB4-MgB20 stoichiometry and\nheated up to 800\u20131200 oC at 2 and 5.5 GPa for 1h.\n\n\fThe structure of the materials was analyzed using TEM, SEM, and X-ray diffraction. A\nZEISS EVO 50XVP scanning electron microscope (resolution of 2 nm at 30 kV), equipped\nwith: (1) an INCA 450 energy-dispersion analyzer of X-ray spectrums (OXFORD, England),\nwhich allows one to perform the quantitative analysis from boron to uranium with a\nsensitivity of 0.1 wt %; microprobe is 2 nm in diameter; (2) a HKL Canell 5 detector of\nbackscattering electrons (OXFORD, England), which can give (using the Kikuchi method)\nthe diffraction reflections of electrons from 10-1000 nm areas and layers were employed. For\nthe SEM study a JXA 88002 microscope was used as well. The microstructure analysis on\nthe nanometer scale was carried out using JEM-2100F TEM equipped with an Oxford INCA\nenergy detector. The quantitative TEM-EDX analysis of boron was performed using the\nOxford INCA energy program, microprobe is 0.7 nm diameter.\nThe values of jc were estimated by an Oxford Instruments 3001 vibrating sample\nmagnetometer (VSM) using Bean's model. Magnetization measurements were also carried\nout on Quantum Design PPMS equipped with vibrating sample magnetometer attachment.\nThe thermal conductivity at room temperature was measured using an \u0406\u04223-\u041c\u0425\u0422\u0406 special\ndevice for determination of a thermal conductivity coefficient by a nonstationary method. For\nRaman studies, we used a WiTec CRM-200 confocal imaging system with the HeNe laser\nexcitation (photon energy of 1.96 eV). The laser beam was focused on the sample using 20x\nor 100x objectives. The spectra were collected in back scattering geometry with a resolution\nof 2 cm-1. Incident laser power was measured directly on the sample stage and did not exceed\n2 mW in order to avoid sample heating.\nHardness was measured using a Mod. MXT-70 Matsuzawa microhardness tester, HV\n(using a Vickers indenter) and a Nano-Indenter II, HB (using a Berkovich indenter).\nThe transport critical current and AC losses were measured by the inductive methods (see\n[8, 9] using two MgB2 rings cut out from bulk cylinders using a comparatively simple cutting\n\n\fmethod developed by us. The method is nondestructive for material superconducting\nproperties and allows easily and precisely cutting brittle and reactive with water MgB2-based\nmaterials (even highly dense HP-synthesized ones). The rings were tested as elements of\ninductive fault current limiter models to investigate the influence of the connection between\ngrains on the quenching current as well as to determine the possibility of MgB2-based\nmaterial application for current limitation.\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\n3.1 Superconducting characteristics of the materials produced under different pressures.\n\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of the critical current density, jc, on the magnetic field at 20\nand 30 K measured by the magnetization method for the materials fabricated by different\npressure-using methods. The material's densities, \uf067, which were attained, are presented in\nTable 1. The highest \uf067 and jc are demonstrated by materials prepared at a pressure of 2 GPa.\nThe currently available high-pressure apparatuses (HPA) allow producing cylindrical blocks\nup to 62 mm in diameter and 20 mm in height under 2 GPa pressure and HPA for\nmanufacturing blocks up to 150 mm in diameter is being constructed.\nFigures 2a, b demonstrate the critical current density, jc, vs. magnetic field at 20 K of the\nhigh pressure-synthesized materials with and without additions produced from two different\ntypes of boron at the optimal temperatures from the point of view of highest jc in low and\nhigh magnetic fields. At 20 K the high-pressure-synthesized (in situ) MgB2-based materials\n1HP (with 10 wt.% of SiC additions) and 2HP (without additions) prepared from boron (I)\nand magnesium (I) demonstrated the highest jc in magnetic fields up to 5.5 and 4.5 T,\nrespectively, while the jc of 4HP material synthesized without additions from boron (II) and\n\n\ffine magnesium (II) was the highest in the fields above 5.5 T, Fig. 1a. The experiments show\nthat for 4HP material (without any additions) at 18.5 K the irreversible field was Hirr=15 T\n(Fig. 3a) and at 22 K the upper critical field was Hc2=15 T (Fig.3b) which are the highest\nvalues ever mentioned in the literature. For comparison the Hc2 = 14 T exhibited by the\ncarbon-doped magnesium diboride MgB2-xCx (x=0.1) at 18.5 K [10], while for 4HP such Hc2\nwas observed at 23 K. Since our measurements can be carried out only up to 15 T, it was not\npossible to experimentally find Hc2 at a temperature lower than 22 K.\nThe highest values of jc at 30 K in the fields below 1 T were obtained for the samples\nhigh-pressure synthesized in-situ without additions (Fig. 1 b) that can be attributable to their\nhigher transition temperature. The transition temperature, Tc, of the samples with SiC\nadditions prepared from the same initial boron under the same pressure-temperature-time\nconditions was somewhat lower as compared with that of the material without additions and\nthis was due to an increase of the amount of nonsuperconducting phase in the\nsuperconducting matrix. Unexpectedly high (ever observed) upper critical and irreversible\nfields as well as critical current density in magnetic fields higher than 5.5 T (Figs. 1 and 3,\ncurves 5) are demonstrated by rather porous\n\nHP4 material (Fig. 4) high-pressure\u2013\n\nsynthesized from fine magnesium (II) and boron (II) at a very low temperature (600 oC). But\nthis material has a low transition temperature of 34.5\u201334 K (Fig. 5, curve 8 ) and low values\nof critical current density in low magnetic fields (Figs. 1a, b). Attempts to increase the jc\nvalue of the material by increasing the synthesis temperature (under the same pressure-time\nconditions) failed: higher synthesis temperature resulted in a decrease of the material's jc in\nthe 10\u201335 K temperature and 0\u201310 T magnetic field ranges.\nAs it possible to see from the results shown in Fig. 2 such additions as SiC and Ti may\nincrease jc of high-pressure-synthesized MgB2-based materials at least in some magnetic\nfields, but the absolute values of jc depends on the type of initial boron and synthesis\n\n\ftemperatures Ts. Usually the materials synthesized at high pressure and temperature (1050\no\n\nC) exhibit high jc in zero, low, and medium magnetic fields (up to 4.5\u20137 T at 20 K), while\n\nthe materials synthesized at lower temperature (800 oC) have high jc in high magnetic fields.\nBut in principle high SC performance can be attained for the materials without additions.\nAs a rule, the materials high-pressure sintered (ex-situ) from a MgB2 powder, (3HP, for\nexample, Fig. 1), showed a somewhat lower jc than those synthesized (in-situ) from Mg and\nB. That seems is due to the formation of larger MgB2 clusters and less homogeneous\ndistribution of oxygen-enriched or other inclusions, which are located around clusters and can\nreduce connectivity in the material or can prevent from creating the homogeneous pinning\n(Figs. 6a, b, c). However, at present there is no certain explanation of this phenomenon.\nMaterials produced under lower pressures using hot pressing (30 MP) and spark\nplasma sintering (50 MPa) techniques, (6Hot-P and 5SPS, respectively in Fig. 1),\ndemonstrated lower magnetically estimated critical current densities and material's density\n(Table 1, Fig. 7) than those produced at high pressure, but their jc are still rather high for the\neffective application. Besides, lower pressure makes the manufacture of larger blocks and\nparts of easier.\nThe material of rings manufactured by HIP, 7 HIP, or pressureless synthesis, 8PL\n(under 0. 1 MPa of argon) exhibited the least jc and density (Fig. 1, Table 1), but in general\ntheir characteristics are high enough for the application as well.\n\n3.2 Structural features of the materials prepared at high pressure and hot pressing.\n\nFigure 8 presents structures of high-pressure-synthesized (in situ) materials aimed to\nshow their density (secondary electron image - SEI) and distribution of oxygen and higher\nborides inclusions (backscattering electron image - BEI). In backscattering electron regime or\n\n\fat compositional contrast images the brightness increases with increasing mean atomic\nnumber, Z', of the irradiated region, where Z'=\uf053ciZi and ci is the weight fraction of element\nZi. The structure of materials synthesized under high pressure can be near theoretically dense,\nsee, for example, Fig. 8 b. In previous publications [7, 11] we discussed the dependence of\ncritical current density on the amount, distribution, and size of \"black\" inclusions of higher\nborides, the stoichiometry of which in high-pressure (2 GPa) synthesized and sintered MgB2\nmaterials is usually near MgB12 (Fig. 8) and in materials obtained by hot-pressing (30 MPa) is\nnear MgB7 (Fig. 7). Despite the fact that higher borides are present in the structure of MgB2based materials in large quantities, they can not be practically revealed in X-ray patterns.\nThis can be explained by poor diffracted signals because of the low X-ray atomic scattering\nfactor of boron [6]; besides, inclusions of higher borides are dispersed in MgB2. The etalon\nX-ray pattern of MgB12 is absent in the database and the literature data are contradictive\n(some authors mentioned the orthorhombic structure of MgB12 [12] and the other ones\npointed out that it was rhombohedral or hexagonal [13]). Our numerous observations showed\nthat in the structures of high pressure synthesized MgB2-based materials with higher critical\ncurrent densities usually higher amount of fine dispersed MgB12 inclusions are present.\nFigures 6d and 8m demonstrate the absence of oxygen-enriched inclusions in the MgB2\nstructure around grains of higher borides. Up to now we have thought that inclusions of\nhigher borides and MgB12, in particular, can play a role of pinning centers in MgB2 but it may\nbe that in addition, they can affect the oxygen distribution in the MgB2 matrix and assist the\nformation of oxygen-enriched Mg-B-O inclusions, which can influence pinning as well.\nOur attempts to find correlations between the total oxygen content in the MgB2\nmaterials matrix, its amount in starting boron or magnesium diboride and critical current\ndensity were failed [14]. But it seems that more important for material's superconducting\nproperties is the oxygen distribution mode. By comparing the dependences of jc (Fig. 2),\n\n\fmaterials structures (Fig. 8) and results of SEM microprobe analysis it is possible to resume\nthe following. The matrix of all HP-synthesized samples contained Mg and B in near-MgB2\nstoichiometry and some amount of oxygen (5-10 wt.% or sometimes even more). Oxygen in\nMgB12 inclusions was practically absent (the fact that we found oxygen in a small amount of\n0.2-1.2 wt.% in these inclusions may be the result of \"touching\" by electron beam the area\naround the MgB12 inclusion). Our structural observations have shown that at a synthesis\ntemperature of about 800 oC oxygen is more homogeneously distributed in the matrix\nmaterial (Figs. 8d, e), but in the material synthesized at 1050 oC the distribution of oxygen in\nthe matrix is less homogeneous: the oxygen-enriched small areas form (more bright areas in\nFigs. 8 a, c) and with addition of Ta or Ti such areas are transformed into well delineated\ndispersed Mg-B-O inclusions (light or white inclusions in Figs. 8f-h). In the materials with\nSiC additions such Mg-B-O inclusions are observed as well (Fig. 8k, l), they are well seen in\nplaces where SiC inclusions are absent. The values of jc correlate well with such a so-called\nsegregation of oxygen in MgB2-based structures: usually the higher segregation corresponds\nto higher jc. The matrix of material with these oxygen-enriched inclusions produced at 1050\no\n\nC (from Mg and B with 10 wt.% of Ti additions) contains less oxygen (1.5 \u2013 5 %) than that\n\n(8 %) in low-temperature produced samples at 800 oC. The results of SEM microprobe study\nand SEM images (Fig. 9) give proofs that white inclusions formed consist of Mg, B and O\nand that amount of oxygen in them are higher than that in the surrounding MgB2 matrix.\nAs seen from the results shown in Fig. 2 and by other our mutual observations,\ndifferent types of amorphous boron as well as magnesium diboride produced even by the\nsame company after sintering or synthesis under the same high pressure\u2013high temperature\nconditions demonstrate rather different superconducting characteristics (for example,\ndependences of jc on magnetic field), while the reproducibility of these characteristics for\neach type of boron or magnesium diboride is very high. The difference in oxygen content\n\n\f(0.66\u20133.7 %) and materials grain sizes (0.8\u20139.6 \u03bcm) between the initial powders were not the\ndominant reasons. So, possibly some other admixture in the initial boron or magnesium\ndiboride can affect the materials behavior (with high probability it can be carbon and/or\nhydrogen), for example, the formation of magnesium hydride [15] or carbon incorporation in\nthe material structure and into magnesium diboride lattice, in particular [10].\nThe structure of the material with high Hc2 (4HP in Fig. 1) is very fine and complicated for\nthe investigation (Fig. 4).The dark grey matrix is of near MgB4 composition, black inclusions\nwith near the MgB20 stoichiometry are observed, the stoichiometry of the brightest white\ninclusions or spots are of near MgO composition. Less bright inclusions or spots contained\nMg, B and O, for example, the average composition of the area inside square \"A\" had\nstoichiometry close to MgB3.1O0.3 and the material matrix contains 7 wt% of oxygen.\nReflexes marked \"x\" at X-ray pattern may be assigned to higher borides. Despite the fact\nthat reflex at 2\uf051 = 26.8 o may be attributed to hexagonal BN the absence of nitrogen in the\nmaterial structure and the increase of reflex intensity with the increase of the amount of\nhigher borides and even with the amount of boron in higher boride gave us grounds to\nassociate its appearance with higher borides.\nFor our observation the improvement of materials jc in the case of SiC adding\noccurred when there was no notable interaction between SiC and MgB2 (when the X-ray\npattern contains reflexes of SiC, but no reflexes of Mg2Si and when reflexes of MgB2 are not\nshifted from the etalon positions). Additions of SiC also seem to promote the oxygen\nsegregation (Figs. 8j-l), besides, SiC grains may produce effective pinning by themselves.\nThe evolution of the material structure synthesized or sintered under high pressure (2\nGPa) allows us to propose the following correlations between the structural features and\nmaterials superconductive characteristics. Matrix contains oxygen, the ratio between B and\nMg in matrix is near to MgB2. Possibly oxygen solved in MgB2, lattice parameters of\n\n\fmagnesium diboride synthesized (ex-situ) or sintered (in situ) in the 700\u20131100\n\no\n\nC\n\ntemperature range varied as follows: a = 0.30747 \u2013 0.30822 nm and c = 0.35174 \u2013 0.35212\nnm and the MgB2 reflexes practically did not shift from their etalon positions. Only small\namount of MgO is usually present in the materials and its content does not depend on the\ntemperature- pressure conditions. At low temperature (700\u2013800 oC) grains of higher borides\nare forming (mainly of the MgB12 stoichiometry, while grains with composition near MgB1617\n\nor MgB20 can also be present), after cooling one can observe dispersed grains of higher\n\nborides in the MgB2 matrix. Larger amount of MgB12 and smaller MgB12 grains are usually\nobserved in materials with higher jc (especially in high magnetic fields). Oxygen is\npractically absent in the structure of higher borides and during crystallization it seems that\nhigher boride grains even promote the oxygen \"pushing away\" from the MgB2 matrix\nsurrounding the inclusions and thus cleaned the MgB2 grain boundaries from oxygen (see, for\nexample, Fig. 6d and 8m). Additions of Ti, Ta or Zr stimulate the formation of higher borides\nand absorb admixture hydrogen at low manufacturing temperatures, prevent harmful (for\nmaterial jc) MgH2 from being formed and thus, affect the oxygen distribution (segregation)\nstimulating the formation of Mg-B-O inclusions, which in turn can act as pinning centers in\nthe material.\nAt higher temperatures (900\u20131050 oC) even under high pressure (2 -5 GPa) admixing\nhydrogen usually \"leave\" the material structure. As the manufacturing temperature increases,\nthe amount of higher borides decreases but oxygen is redistributed into separate dispersed\nMg-B-O areas or inclusions (especially, when Ti or Ta is added), which can promote pinning.\nHigh manufacturing temperatures, as a rule, result in an increase of jc in low and medium\nmagnetic fields.\nOxygen does not usually solve in the structure of higher borides [7] but it can be\nincorporated in the MgB2 structure even without its essential disturbance [16]. According to\n\n\f[13], the reaction in Mg-B system starts from the MgB12 formation and then MgB2 forms, so\ngrains of MgB12 are possibly, centers of the MgB2 phase crystallization. As it was shown in\n[17] Ti, Ta, and Zr at low synthesis temperatures can react with hydrogen to form hydrides\n(Ta2H, TiH1,924, ZrH2), thus preventing the MgH2 forming and promoting the liberation of\nMg, which may react with boron. Because of this larger amount of dispersed MgB12\ninclusions or other higher borides can appear. As the synthesis temperature increases, Mg\nintensively diffuses toward grains of MgB12 or higher borides and react with them, so, they\nbecome smaller due to the formation of MgB2 at their periphery and because oxygen is absent\nin the structures of higher borides, the forming MgB2 matrix phase contains much less\noxygen and, may be because of this, it seems that oxygen or oxygen-enriched inclusions are\n\"pushed out\" from the area around the higher boride inclusion. So, on the one hand,\ninclusions of higher borides (or grain boundaries between MgB2 matrix and higher boride\ninclusions) can increase pinning, and on the other, higher borides can promote the \"cleaning\"\nof MgB2 intragrain boundaries from oxygen, thus improving connectivity and\nsuperconducting characteristics, jc, in particular.\n\n3.4 Raman spectroscopy study of Mg-B -based materials.\n\nThe presence of higher borides may influence the critical current density of\nmagnesium diboride-based materials. However, there exists the vagueness concerning\nappearance, composition and structure of higher boride phases (MgB4, MgB6 or MgB7,\nMgB12 , MgB16 or MgB17 and MgB20) in the literature.\nThe author of [12] reported the synthesis of an orthorhombic MgB12 single crystal,\nspace group Pnma with a = 1.6632(3)  \u030a nm, b = 1.7803(4) nm and c = 1.0396(2) nm from the\nelemental magnesium and boron in a Mg/Cu melt at 1600 oC (Cu, Mg and B mixed in the\n\n\fmolar ratio of 5:3:2) and claimed that according to the preliminary results, the single\ncrystalline samples were non-superconducting down to 2K. According to [13], the structure\nof the synthesized MgB12 and MgB20 materials was rhombohedral or trigonal with lattice\nparameters a = 1.1014(7) nm, c = 2.4170(2) nm) and\n\na = 1.09830(4) nm , c = 24.1561(2)\n\nnm, respectively. MgB7, crystallizes in the space group Imam with a = 0.5597(3) nm, b =\n8.125(3) nm , and c = 10.480(5) nm.\nWe synthesized materials with superconducting characteristics from the mixtures of\nMg and B taken in the 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:12, 1:17, 1:20 ratios exposed to 2 GPa and 800 or\n1200 oC for 1 h. In the case when the stoichiometry of the resulting material matrix was near\nMgB12 (confirmed by the SEM and TEM observations) the critical current density was rather\nhigh (up to 55 kA/cm2 in zero field and Hirr=7.2 T at 10 K and up to 45 kA/cm2 in zero field\nand Hirr=4,7 T at 20 K), and the materials had sharp SC transition at about 37 K (determined\nfrom the imagined and real parts of the AC susceptibility curves) [11]. The materials with\nthe highest jc and amount of superconducting phase (among those prepared from mixtures\nwith higher boron content than in case of Mg:B =1:2) were materials synthesized from\nmixtures with the Mg:B ratios of 1:8 [11] and 1:20 (Figs. 10b, d, f, h) at 2 GPa, 1200 oC for\n1 h. But when the Mg:B =1:8 mixture was exposed to 5.5 GPa, 1200 oC for 24 h we got\nessentially nonsuperconducting material (Fig.10g), which structure according to X-ray\nconsisted mainly of the MgB7 phase and rather big amount of MgO (Fig. 10a). However the\nSEM EDX study revealed that the matrix of this material was close to MgB12 in composition\n(Fig. 10e). Despite the fact that both matrixes had near MgB12 stoichiometry according to the\nSEM study (Figs. 10e, f), their superconducting properties (10g, h) and Raman spectra (10c,\nd) are very different. X-ray patterns of these samples are rather different as well. It should be\nnoted that very often a large amount of higher borides, which are present in the materials,\ncannot be revealed by X-ray diffraction because of the dominating reflexes of MgB2 phase\n\n\fdespite its fraction in the samples is very small. It seems that in contrary to X-ray, Raman\nspectroscopy may be of great help in distinguishing between phases of different\nstoichiometry in such cases.\n\n3.5 Mechanical characteristics of high pressure prepared Mg-B-based materials.\n\nThe hardness, fracture toughness and Young modulus of high-pressure manufactured\nmaterials were estimated by indentation methods. Despite the fact that an indentation load is\nincluded into the formulas for determining the mechanical properties, in the case of ceramic\nmaterials it is important to mention the indentation load because of the elastic aftereffect and\nchanging of the indent shape after removing the indenter. The elastic aftereffect results in an\nincrease of the estimated values of microhardness and fracture toughness as the indentation\nload decreases. The hardness or microhardness (estimated under a comparatively high load)\nis an integrated characteristic and gives a notion about the mechanical properties of a material\nas a whole, because the area of the indent is rather large and many grains appear under the\nindent. Using the nanohardness one can characterize mechanical properties of separate\nphases, which are present in the material if the size of their grains or the area occupied by the\nphase is enough for performing the study.\nThe microhardness of the material sintered at high pressure (2 GPa) and high temperature\n(800 oC), determined using a Vickers indenter (Hv) under a load of 4,9 N was: 12.65\uf0b11.39\nGPa (for the material without additions), 13.08\uf0b11.07 GPa for 10% Ta addition and 12.1\n\uf0b10.08 GPa for 2% Ti addition. The Vickers hardness under a 148.8 N load was Hv=10.12\uf0b10.2\nGPa. Because of the absence of cracks under a load of 4.9 N, the fracture toughness was\nestimated at a load of 148.8 N: K1C=4.4\uf0b1 0.04 MPa*m0.5 for the material without additions\nand K1C=7.6\uf0b1 2.0 MPa*m0.5 for the material with addition of 10% Ta.\n\n\fThe mechanical properties (Berkovich nanohardness and Young modulus) of MgB12\ninclusions (of about 10 \u03bcm in size) in the MgB2 matrix of high-pressure sintered material\nwere estimated using a Nano Indenter II nanohardness tester. The nanohardness of inclusions\nwith near MgB12 stoichiometry at a 60 mN-load is 35.6\uf0b10.9 GPa, which is higher than that\nof sapphire (31.1\uf0b12.0 GPa), while the nanohardness of the \"matrix\" under the same load was\n17.4\uf0b11.1 GPa only. The Young modulus is 213\uf0b118 GPa for the \"matrix\", 385\uf0b114 GPa for\nthe inclusion and 416\uf0b1 22 GPa for sapphire.\nThe Vickers microhardness (Hv) of the material with near MgB12 composition, prepared\nat 2 GPa and 1200 oC for 1 h was twice as high as that of MgB2 (25\u00b11.1 GPa and 12.1\u00b10.8\nGPa, respectively, at a load of 4.9 N).\nThe addition of Ti or Ta makes MgB2-based materials high-pressure produced at low\ntemperatures (700\u2013800 oC) denser and more mechanically stable due to the possibility to\nabsorb admixture hydrogen and thus, prevent pores and crack from being formed (especially\nin large blocks).\n\n3.5 Applicability of MgB2-based materials for current limitation.\n\nFigure 11 demonstrates the results of testing the ring cut from hot pressure (Hot-P)\nsynthesized block. The contactless transformer method is suitable for samples in the form of\nhollow superconducting cylinders and rings and allows one to achieve high currents flowing\nin the superconductor using the usual laboratory equipment. A ring forms the secondary coil\nof a transformer, in which the primary coil is connected with a circuit of an AC source. To\nincrease the coupling between the coils, the ring and primary coil are centered on a\nferromagnetic core. This method may be related to AC loss measurements in samples with a\ntransport current. The losses can be calculated from the primary coil current and voltage\n\n\fwaveforms. The analysis of these waveforms also allows studying the peculiarities of the\nmagnetic field penetration and quenching [8-9].\nThe dimensions of the tested rings were the following for ring 1: outer diameter \u2013\n21.3 mm, height - 14.1 mm, wall thickness \u2013 3.5 mm and for ring 2: outer diameter \u2013 45 mm,\nheight - 11.6 mm, wall thickness \u2013 3.3 mm (Fig. 11e). Ring 1 was tested in the temperature\nrange from 4.2 to 40 K; ring 2 \u2013 at 4.2 K (liquid helium). The behavior of the rings is similar\nand qualitatively independent of temperature. As an example the results for ring 2 are\npresented in Figs. 11. The quenching current determined from response of the transformer\ndevices, in which the secondary winding was fabricated as a superconducting ring, to a\ncurrent pulse. The quenching current is determined as a current corresponding to jump on the\nvoltage trace and is estimated at 24000 A. The critical current density is 63200 A/cm2. This\nvalue is about an order of magnitude lower than the critical value obtained from\nmagnetization experiment (6.105 A/cm2). This can be explained by the granular structure of\nthe superconductor, when the critical current density measured from magnetization is mainly\ndetermined by this density in granules but the transport critical current is determined by the\nproperties of intergranular area. At a lower voltage of source (125 V) (Fig. 11d) quenching is\nobserved after several periods of a current, during which the cylinder is heated. These losses\ntill quenching are about 17 J (Fig. 11b). Power of the losses is about 200 W. The VSM tests\nhave shown that SC characteristics (dependences of jc on H) of the HP-synthesized MgB2based material remained practically unchanged after 6 years of keeping in air at room\ntemperature.\nCooling of the high-temperature superconducting cylinders from BSCCO takes a\nprolonged time due to their low thermal conductivity (~ 1 W/K m) and after fault current\nlimitation superconducting properties do not recover for about 1 s as it is required for\napplication of these FCLs in power systems. The critical current of the BSCCO ring with a\n\n\fdiameter of 20 cm, thickness of 0.5 cm, and height of 10 cm is about 3.500 A at 77 K. At the\nsame time the critical current of the MgB2 ring with a diameter of 4.5 cm, thickness of 0.33\ncm and height of 1.2 cm is about 2.4 104 A at 4\u201310 K.\nThe thermal conductivity of HP\u2013synthesized MgB2\u2013based materials is much higher (53 \u00b12\nW/(m\u00d7K) at 300 K, Table 2) than of BSCCO, which is considered to be promising for\napplication in the transformer-type fault current limiters. The higher thermal conductivity and\nmuch more homogeneity of the superconducting properties of MgB2 synthesized under\npressure (Fig. 5, curves 1\u20133) should prevent the creation of overheated domains in the\ncondition when BSCCO can be destroyed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh pressure (2 GPa) synthesized or sintered materials under optimal conditions\nexhibited the higher critical current densities (estimated magnetically) and the lower porosity\nthan hot-pressed (30 MPa) or SPS-manufactured (50 MPa) ones. Synthesized in situ MgB2based materials usually demonstrate a somewhat higher jc than sintered ex situ. But for\npractical application all these materials have rather high superconducting and mechanical\ncharacteristics. It is surprising that a low-temperature (600 oC) high-pressure synthesized\nmaterial without additions having rather high porosity (around 17 %) demonstrated at 20 K\nextremely high Hc2 and Hirr (the highest ever observed, even higher than that of C-doped\nmaterials). By varying synthesis or sintering conditions as well as the amount and type of\nadditives (Ti, Ta, SiC) we can essentially affect critical current density of MgB2-based\nmaterials, may be it is because of the variation of the oxygen distribution in the materials\nstructure and the formation of dispersed Mg-B-O regions or inclusions with high\nconcentration of oxygen. Besides, it is possible to promote the higher borides formation in\nMgB2-based material matrix, influence their size and distribution, which in turn can affect jc.\n\n\fBut we cannot exclude that the higher borides du0ring their formation influence the oxygen\ndistribution in material matrix as well. The higher synthesis temperatures promote oxygen\nredistribution and segregation. In the case of SiC additions the increase of jc was observed\nwhen there was no interaction between MgB2 and SiC notable by the X-ray analysis and it\nseems that inclusion of SiC together with segregate oxygen-enriched inclusions can affect\npinning and may promote increasing of jc. Despite the possibility to influence SC\ncharacteristics using additions or varying manufacturing temperature our numerous\nexperiments have shown that the determinative role in attaining high superconductive\ncharacteristics of MgB2-based materials is played by the quality of initial boron or\nmagnesium diboride. Up to now it is not clear what characteristic or impurity played the main\nrole in the tested initial materials (several types of amorphous boron containing 0.66\u20133.7 %\noxygen and with average grain sizes of 0.8\u20134 \u03bcm and magnesium diboride with 0.8\u20133.5%\noxygen and 0.8\u20139.6 \u03bcm grains). It can be admixture of carbon or hydrogen, for example.\nIt has been shown that higher borides can be revealed in MgB2 using Raman\nspectroscopy. The Raman spectrum of that material that according to X-ray had MgB7\ncomposition (with some impurity MgO) has been obtained. But in contradiction with X-ray\ndata the SEM EDX study shows that the material had near MgB12 stoichiometry.\nThe tests of rings from the MgB2 demonstrated perspectives of their application in\ntransformer type fault current limiters. The high values of Hc2 attained make it possible the\nuse of bulk MgB2 in high magnetic fields, for manufacturing of magnets, etc.\n\nReferences\n\n1. C. Buzea and T. Yamashita, Supercond. Sci.
