There are two competing scenarios for the formation of bulges.\nOne assumes that the bulge and disk form independently, with the bulge preceding the disk (e..g.\nAndredakis, Peletier & Balcells 1995, hereafter APB95), while the other suggests that the disk\nforms first and the bulge emerges later from it by secular evolution (Courteau, de Jong & Broeils\n1996). However, recent analysis of a complete sample of early type disk galaxies (Khosroshahi,\nWadadekar & Kembhavi 2000, hereafter KWK) has shown that more than one mechanism of bulge\nformation may be at work. This is corroborated by recent HST observations, which show that\ndistinct bulge formation mechanisms operate for large and small bulges.\nRecent studies have revealed that the bulges of early type disk galaxies are old (Peletier et\nal. 1999). This is in agreement with semi-analytical results which claim that the bulges of field\n1\n\nInter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Post Bag 4, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411007, India;\nhabib@iucaa.ernet.in, yogesh@iucaa.ernet.in, akk@iucaa.ernet.in\n2\n3\n\nInstitute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences, P.

However, the formation mechanism of the bulges of late type spiral galaxies is likely to be\nvery different. For example, Carollo (1999) found that although a small bulge may form at early\nepochs, it is later fed by gas flowing into the galaxy core, possibly along a bar-like structure caused\nby instabilities in the surrounding disk. The situation becomes more complicated for intermediate\nsized bulges, with some having formed at early epochs and some relatively recently from gas inflows.\nCorrelations among global photometric parameters that characterize the bulge \u2013 such as colors,\nscale lengths etc. \u2013 can be used to differentiate between the competing bulge formation models.\nThese have the advantage of being independent of spectroscopic parameters such as velocity dispersion which are difficult to measure for bulges. Some of the photometric parameters such as the\ncolors are measured directly, while others like the scale lengths require elaborate bulge-disk decomposition using empirical models for the bulge and disk profiles. Conventionally, radial profiles\nof bulges (de Vaucouleurs 1959), like those of elliptical galaxies (de Vaucouleurs 1948), have been\nmodeled by the r 1/4 law. These are fully described by two parameters determined from the best\nfit model \u2013 the central surface brightness \u03bcb (0) and an effective radius re , within which half the\ntotal light of the galaxy is contained. In recent years an additional parameter has been introduced,\nwith the r 1/4 law replaced by a r 1/n law (Sersic 1968), where n is a free parameter (e..g. Caon\net al. 1993, APB95, KWK). The so called Sersic shape parameter n is well correlated with other\nobservables like luminosity, effective radius, the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio and morphological\ntype (APB95). In particular, it has been demonstrated that a tight correlation exists between log n,\nlog re and \u03bcb (0) (KWK).\nIn this letter we show that log n, log re and \u03bcb (0) for elliptical galaxies are tightly distributed\nabout a plane in logarithmic space, and that this photometric plane for elliptical galaxies is indistinguishable from the analogous plane for the bulges of early type disk galaxies. Throughout this\npaper we use H0 = 50 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5.\n\n2.\n\nTHE DATA AND DECOMPOSITION METHOD\n\nThe analysis in this study is based on the near-IR, K-band images of 42 elliptical galaxies,\nin the Coma cluster (Mobasher et al. 1999). This is combined with a complete magnitude and\ndiameter limited sample of 26 early type disk galaxies in the field (Peletier and Balcells 1997) from\nthe Uppsala General Catalogue (Nilson 1973). Details about the sample selection, observations and\ndata reduction are given in the above references. We chose to work with K band images because\nthe relative lack of absorption related features in the band leads to smooth, featureless light profiles\nwhich are convenient for extraction of global parameters.\nExtracting the global bulge parameters of a galaxy requires the separation of the observed light\ndistribution into bulge and disk components. This is best done using a 2-dimensional technique,\nwhich performs a \u03c72 fit of the light profile model to the galaxy image. A scheme is used in which\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\neach pixel is weighted by its estimated signal-to-noise ratio (Wadadekar, Robbason and Kembhavi\n1999).\nWe decomposed all the galaxies in our sample into a bulge component which follows a r 1/n\nlaw with\n1/n\nIbulge (r) = Ib (0)e\u22122.303bn (r/re ) ,\n(1)\nwhere bn = 0.8682n \u2212 0.1405, and r is the distance from the center along the major-axis. The disk\nprofile is taken to be an exponential Id (r) = Id (0)e\u2212(r/rd ) , where rd is the disk scale length and Id (0)\nis the disk central intensity. Apart from the five parameters mentioned here, the fit also involves the\nbulge and disk ellipticities. The model for each galaxy was convolved with the appropriate point\nspread function (PSF). Details of the procedure used in the decomposition of the disk galaxies are\ngiven in KWK. We have got good fits for all 42 of the 48 elliptical galaxies in the complete sample\nof Mobasher et al. (1999) for which we have data, and for 26 of the 30 disk galaxies in the complete\nsample of APB95. Twelve of the 42 elliptical galaxies show a significant disk (D/B & 0.2). Four\ndisk galaxies did not provide good fits because of their complex morphology (see KWK) and these\ngalaxies have been excluded from our discussion.\nIn Figure 1 we plot histograms showing the distribution of the shape parameter n for the\ntwo samples. For elliptical galaxies, n ranges from 1.7 to 4.7 with a clear peak around n = 4.\nThis observation is in agreement with the fact that de Vaucouleurs' law has historically provided\na reasonable fit to the radial profile of most (but not all) elliptical galaxies. For the disk galaxies\nn ranges from 1.4 to 5 with an almost uniform distribution within this range. The rather flat\ndistribution in n for the disk galaxies implies that de Vaucouleurs' law will provide a poor fit to\nthe bulges of these galaxies. This is indeed the case as demonstrated in de Jong (1996).\n\n3.\n\nTHE PHOTOMETRIC PLANE\n\nStudy of the correlations among the parameters describing photometric properties of elliptical\ngalaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies is essential in constraining galaxy formation scenarios. We\nfind that for the spiral galaxies sample, the bulge central surface brightness is well correlated with\nlog n, with a linear correlation coefficient of -0.88 (Figure 2). The corresponding coefficient for the\nelliptical galaxies, also shown in Figure 2, is -0.79. These relations are significant at > 99.99% level\nas measured by the Student's t test. There is a weak correlation between bulge effective radius and\nn for the disk galaxies (KWK) but such a correlation does not exist for the elliptical galaxies.\nAn anti-correlation between the effective radius and mean surface brightness within the effective\nradius \u2013 known as the Kormendy relation (Kormendy 1977, Djorgovski & Davis 1987)\u2013 has been\nreported in elliptical galaxies. In Figure 3 we plot the mean surface brightness within the effective\nradius against effective radius for the two samples. The elliptical galaxies are clustered around the\nbest fit line \u2013 h\u03bcb (re )i = 2.57 log re + 14.07 with rms scatter of 0.59 in mean surface brightness. A\nweaker relation with larger scatter exists for the bulges of the early type spiral galaxies suggesting\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\na formation history similar to that of elliptical galaxies. As we demonstrated in KWK, the bulges\nof late type spiral galaxies do not show a Kormendy type relation, suggesting a different formation\nhistory.\nIt is possible that some of the scatter seen in the Kormendy relation is caused by the effect\nof a third parameter, which can only be n in our scheme. We have applied standard bivariate\nanalysis techniques to obtain the best fit plane in the space of the three parameters log n, \u03bcb (0)\nand log re . We find that the least scatter around the best fit plane is obtained by expressing it in\nthe form log n = A log re + B\u03bcb (0) + constant, and minimizing the dispersion of log n as measured\nby a least-squares fit.\nThe equation of the best fit plane for the elliptical galaxies is\nlog n = (0.173 \u00b1 0.025) log re \u2212 (0.069 \u00b1 0.007)\u03bcb (0) + (1.18 \u00b1 0.05),\n\n(2)\n\nwhile for the bulges of the disk galaxies it is\nlog n = (0.130 \u00b1 0.040) log re \u2212 (0.073 \u00b1 0.011)\u03bcb (0) + (1.21 \u00b1 0.11).\n\n(3)\n\nThe errors in the best fit coefficients here were obtained by fitting planes to synthetic data sets\ngenerated using the bootstrap method with random replacement (Fisher 1993). The scatter in log n\nfor the above planes is 0.043 dex (corresponding to 0.108 magnitude) and 0.058 dex (corresponding\nto 0.145 magnitude) respectively.\nThe angle between the two planes is 2.41 \u00b1 1.99 deg; this error was also obtained by the\nbootstrap technique. The difference in angle between the two planes is only slightly more than the\n1\u03c3 uncertainty, which strongly suggests that the two planes are identical. We therefore obtained a\nnew equation for the common plane, combining the data for the two samples, which is:\nlog n = (0.172 \u00b1 0.020) log re \u2212 (0.069 \u00b1 0.004)\u03bcb (0) + (1.18 \u00b1 0.04),\n\n(4)\n\nThe smaller errors here are due to the increased size of the combined sample.\nA face-on and two mutually orthogonal edge-on views of the best fit plane for the two samples\nare shown in Figure 4. K1 , K2 and K3 are orthonormal vectors constructed from linear combinations\nof the parameters of the photometric plane. An additional representation of this best fit plane with\nlog n as the ordinate, together with the data points used in the fit, is shown in Figure 5. The rms\nscatter in log n here is 0.050 dex, corresponding to 0.125 magnitude. This is comparable to the rms\nerror in the fitted values of log n, so any intrinsic scatter about the plane is small.\nIt is possible that some of the observed correlation is produced due to correlations between\nthe fitted parameters of the bulge-disk decomposition. We have examined the extent of such an\ninduced correlation, using extensive simulations of model galaxies obtained using the observed\ndistributions of n, \u03bcb (0) and re for both samples. We chose at random a large number of n, \u03bcb (0)\nand re triplets from these distributions, with the values in each triplet chosen independently of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\neach other. Such a random selection ensured that there was no correlation between the input\nparameters. Other parameters needed to simulate a galaxy, like disk parameters, were also chosen\nat random from the range of observed values. We added noise at the appropriate level to the\nsimulated images and convolved the models with a representative point spread function. We then\nextracted the parameters for these galaxies using the same procedure as we adopted for the observed\nsample. Results from the fit to the simulated data do not show significant univariate or bivariate\ncorrelations between the extracted parameters. This indicates that the correlations seen in the real\ndata are not generated by correlated errors.\n\n4.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is tempting to investigate the use of Equation 4 as a distance indicator. The main source\nof uncertainty here is that the two distance independent parameters, log n and \u03bcb (0), are in fact\ncorrelated, leading to an increased error in the best-fit photometric plane, and hence in the estimated\nlog re values. This gives an error of 53% in the derived distance, which is similar to the error in\nother purely photometric distance indicators, but is significantly larger than the \u223c 20% error found\nin distances from the the near-IR fundamental plane, using both photometric and spectroscopic\ndata (e..g. Mobasher et al. 1999; Pahre, Djorgovski & de Carvalho 1998). However, data for the\nphotometric plane are easy to obtain, as no spectroscopy is involved and it should be possible to\nget more accurate distances to clusters by independently measuring distances to several galaxies in\nthe cluster.\nThe elliptical galaxies seem to form a more homogeneous population than the bulges of spiral\ngalaxies, as revealed from the distribution of their shape parameter, n. Considering that the nearinfrared light measures contribution from the old stellar population in galaxies (i.e., the integrated\nstar formation) and since the near-infrared mass to luminosity ratio (M/L)K is expected to be\nconstant among the galaxies, the relatively broad range covered by the shape parameter, n, for\nbulges of spirals reveals differences in the distribution of the old population among these bulges.\nEnvironmental factors could play an important role here, since the elliptical galaxies in our sample\nare members of the rich Coma cluster while the spiral galaxies are either in the field or are members\nof small groups. While elliptical galaxies and bulges appear to be different in the context of the\nKormendy relation, they are unified onto a single plane when allowing for differences in their light\ndistribution, as measured by the shape parameter, n. This supports the use of n as a fundamental\nparameter in studying elliptical galaxies and bulges of early type disk galaxies, similar to the\nvelocity dispersion in the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. The existence of a photometric\nplane for ellipticals and bulges of early-type disk galaxies further supports an independent study by\nPeletier et al. (1999) which found that bulges in early type disk galaxies and ellipticals have similar\nstellar content and formation epochs. It will be important to see whether the photometric plane\nfor lenticulars too coincides with the plane for elliptical galaxies and bulges of early type galaxies,\nto explore whether lenticulars indeed provide an evolutionary link between elliptical galaxies and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nearly type disk galaxies.\nThe observed tightness of the photometric plane provides a strong constraint on formation\nscenarios, and therefore it is required to study its physical basis. Recently Lima Neto, Gerbal\n& Marquez (1999) have proposed that elliptical galaxies are stellar systems in a stage of quasiequilibrium, which may in principle, have a unique entropy per unit mass \u2013 the specific entropy.\nIt is possible to compute the specific entropy assuming that elliptical galaxies behave as spherical,\nisotropic, one-component systems in hydrostatic equilibrium, obeying the ideal-gas equations of\nstate. Using the specific entropy and a analytic approximation to the three dimensional deprojection\nof the Sersic profile, they predict a relation between the three parameters of the Sersic law. This\nrelation defines a plane in parameter space which they call the entropic plane. The parameters\nused in their fit are not identical to ours, and therefore a comparison is not straightforward.\nThe photometric plane may be useful in probing the bulge formation mechanism in galaxies.\nIn this context it will be interesting to see whether the bulges of late type disk galaxies also share\na single plane with the bulges of early type disk galaxies and ellipticals. If they do, then a single\nmechanism for bulge formation in all types would be indicated. But if bulges in early and late type\ndisk galaxies are formed differently (Peletier et al. 1999, Carollo 1999) then a single plane is not\nexpected. It will also be of interest to compare scaling laws which follow from the photometric\nplane with those implied by the existence of the fundamental plane (Djorgovski & Davis 1987) of\nelliptical galaxies.\nWe thank S.
