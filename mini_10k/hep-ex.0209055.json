A thorough investigation of\nB decays requires the ability to study decay modes containing single photons,\n\u03c0 0 's, and \u03b7's. Total absorption shower counters made of scintillating crystals\nhave been known for decades for their superb energy and spatial resolutions.\nThe crystals act as both the shower development medium and light producer.\nLead tungstate (PbWO4 ) crystals are distinguished with their high density,\nshort radiation length and small Moliere radius. The CMS and ALICE experiments at the CERN LHC have chosen these crystals for their Electromagnetic\ncalorimeters [2],[3]. An electromagnetic calorimeter made of PbWO4 crystals\nhas also been selected as the baseline for the BTeV experiment. Unlike CMS\nor ALICE BTeV ECAL is not in a high magnetic field, so we can use photomultiplier tubes rather than avalanche photodiodes or vacuum phototriodes.\nThis should provide less noise and better resolution at low energies. According to the PbWO4 manufacturers specifications the expected light collection\nis \u22485000 photoelectrons at 1 GeV.\nThe performance of lead tungstate crystals produced in Bogoroditsk TechnoChemical Plant (BTCP) and Shanghai Institute of Ceramics (SIC) has been\nstudied at the accelerator U70 in Protvino, Russia in 2001. The specific goals\nwere to understand how to set specifications for crystal production and measure the predicted energy and position resolution.\n\n2\n\nTestbeam Facility\n\nThe BTeV ECAL testbeam setup consisted of a 5 \u00d75 array of PbWO4 crystals\ncoupled to ten-stage photomultiplier tubes, a beam with a momentum tagging\nsystem on individual particles and a trigger system using scintillation counters\n(see Fig. 1). The crystals had a square cross-section of 27\u00d727 mm2 and were\n220 mm long and wrapped with 170\u03bcm Tyvec.\nPbWO4 light yield strongly depends on temperature [2],[5]. To eliminate the\neffects of temperature variation crystals were placed inside a thermally insulated light-tight box. We controlled the temperature in the box using a\nLAUDA cryothermostat with an accuracy of \u00b10.1 \u25e6 C. To measure the temperature of the crystals, 24 separate temperature sensors were placed on the\nfront and rear ends of various crystals.\nA moving platform was used to inject the beam on different points of the\ncrystal matrix. The platform was designed to move in the both vertical and\n2\n\n\fhorizontal directions and was controlled remotely. The box was placed on a\nrevolving table mounted on the platform. Rotation of the table was important\nfor studying an angular resolution and optical transmission of the crystals.\nIn order to measure the energy resolution we need to take into account the\nelectron beam energy spread which was 2-3% at high energies up to 45 GeV\nand was 5-7% at low energies down to 1 GeV. These values are significantly\nlarger than expected performance of the crystals. Thus we constructed a system that measured the momentum of each electron in the beam [7]. It consisted\nof four drift chamber stations and an analyzing magnet. Three stations had\nX and Y chamber pairs, and the fourth one had only an X chamber pair.\nEach chamber covered an area about 20 \u00d7 20 cm2 . A gas mixture of 70% Ar\nand 30% isobutane was used. The position resolution of the chambers was\n160 \u03bcm. An electron momentum was measured with a resolution of 0.13% at\n45 GeV where the multiple scattering was negligible. At 1 GeV the resolution\nof 2% was caused mainly by multiple scattering of electrons on materials along\nthe beam line (the flanges of the vacuum tubes and drift chambers, 0.006 of\nradiation length in total.)\nThe positions of the beam telescope scintillating counters S1, S2, S3 and S4\nare shown in Fig. 1. Counters sizes were 10 cm in diameter for S1, S2 and\nS3 and 15 \u00d7 15 cm for S4. The coincidence of the signals from these counters\nformed the main beam trigger. The finger counters Fx and Fy with sizes 5 mm\nwere used mainly in calibration and precise energy resolution measurements\nto limit the beam size.\nData acquisition (DAQ) was CAMAC-based and PC-controlled using VME\n(see Fig. 2). The DAQ system consisted of\n\u2022 CAMAC crate with an ADC system for crystals readout,\n\u2022 TDC modules measuring the timing of drift chambers signals, and\n\u2022 trigger logic.\nU70 side\n\nM14\nBeam\n\n55mrad\nDC2\nECAL\n\nDC1\n\nDC3\nDC4\n\n5676\n\nS4,Fx,Fy,Veto\n\n1164\n\n4000\n\nS3\n\n1298\n\n5383\n\nS1,S2\n\nFig. 1. Testbeam setup. DC indicates sets of drift chambers, while M14 is a dipole\nbending magnet and ECAL is a calorimeter prototype. (All distances are in mm.)\n\n3\n\n\fA CES CBD8210 CAMAC branch driver VME board was used as an interface\nto the CAMAC crates. It also provided interrupts to control DAQ program\nflow. The DAQ programs ran in a PC under Linux operating system. A Bit3\nPCI-VME interface was used to communicate with the VME crate. The Fermilab software tool HistoScope was used both as run-control frame and for a\nsimple on-line analysis of the data. Data also were sent to another computer\nfor more detailed analysis and archiving. This was implemented by pipe and\nTCP/IP socket system calls. The slow control subsystem included\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nhigh voltage control and monitoring by LeCroy 1440 HV power supply,\ntemperature control of the crystal's box using the LAUDA cryothermostat,\nmonitoring of temperatures in the crystal matrix by a set of thermistors,\nmonitoring of the phototubes gains via pulsed LED,\nthe moving platform control elements.\n\nLight from each crystal was viewed by a PMT through an optical grease coupling. We used R5800 Hamamatsu phototubes equipped with transistorized\nbases developed at Fermilab. High voltage to the tubes was supplied by a\nLeCroy 1440 HV system. Signals were sent to the control room patch-panel\nwithout any connection to ground inside the crystal box to avoid ground loops.\nLeCroy 2285 15-bits integrating ADC modules were used to measure the signal charge within 150 ns gate, chosen to be somewhat longer than the natural\ndecay time of the crystals, where we expect 99% of the light in 100 ns. The\nADC sensitivity could be programmed with a power controller module. During\nmost of our studies we used 30 fC per count.\nSignals from drift chamber sense wires were sent to amplifier-discriminator\ncards that were installed on the chambers. We used UPD16 cards produced\nby the IHEP Electronics department with a 2.5 \u03bcA threshold. The output\nfrom the UPD16 was a balanced ECL signal with an 80 ns width. The output\nsignal went to a TDC input using a 60-meter twisted-pair cable and started the\nTDC conversion operation. The conversion was stopped by a delayed trigger.\nThe delay was chosen to have all start\u2013stop time values in the 1 ms timeout\nwindow. With a 10-bit TDC scale, the precision is 1 ns per count.\n\n3\n\nMonitoring System\n\nOne of the problems in high precision measurements is the long-term stability\nof measuring devices. Placing the crystal matrix together with photomultipliers into a thermoinsulated box we have reduced already the influence of the\ntemperature, which is the most important instability factor. But we still had\nsome electronics outside the box. Besides, some other factors (such as photomultiplier gain dependence on mean anode current) might cause drift in the\n4\n\n\fVME-PCI\n\nPC Linux\n\nVME\n\nanalysis\n\n2285\nADC\n\n2132\n\n2280\nADC\ncontroller\n\nTDC 3377\n\nCAMAC branch\n\nMove\n\nCurrentLoop 20mA\n\nCurrentLoop 20mA\n\nDAQ\n\nCBD8210\n\nPC Linux\n\nBit3 617\n\nEthernet\n\nTrigger Logic\n\nPMT signal\nHV\nLeCroy 1440\n\nThermistors data\nPWO box\nCryothermostat\n\nLED\n\nMoving platform\n\ngenerator\n\nLED strobe\nChambers\n\nBeam counters\n\nFig. 2. Testbeam DAQ diagram\n\noutput signal. To monitor and take into account possible drift, a LED pulser\nsystem was implemented. A generator fired the super-bright blue LED with\n470 nm wavelength, that provided light to 50 fibers. Each fiber was fed to one\n(crystal+PMT+ADC) channel of the setup. To monitor the stability of the\nLED pulser we used 2 PIN-diodes HAMAMTSU S6468-05 as well as a dedicated PMT with calibrated light from a light source with YAP:Ce crystal [6].\nThe LED pulses had the height 2\u20133 times less and the width similar to those\nof the scintillation light produced in the PbWO4 crystal by 27 GeV electron.\nThe LED was triggered by the DAQ system 10 times during each of the intervals between accelerator spills. This provided enough statistics to accurately\nmonitor the stability every few minutes. We had checked the stability of the\nLED pulser relative to the YAP:Ce calibrated light and found it was better\n0.1% during at least 15 hours.\n\n4\n\nCrystal Light Response Uniformity\n\nGEANT simulations show that an adequate light response uniformity along\nthe length of the crystal is a key to achieve excellent energy resolution (see\nFig. 8). The non-uniformity of the light yield (LY) along the crystal length\ncontributes to the constant term of the relative energy resolution.\nTo measure the LY uniformity, the 5 \u00d7 5 crystal matrix was rotated by 90\u25e6\naround the vertical axis and crystals were scanned using a muon beam in\n1 cm steps. The position of the muon track going through the crystal was\nreconstructed using the drift chambers. Pulse-height distribution collected for\n5\n\n\fFig. 3. Fit results for the energy loss distributions of 5 crystals as a function of\nthe position along the crystal. PMT position is at the X=0 cm. LY on Y -axis were\nnormalized to the LY at X=11 cm. Each plot corresponds to one crystal.\n\neach of the 1 cm intervals along the crystal lengths were fitted with a modified\nLandau distribution to obtain a peak position.\nThe peak position of the energy loss distribution for minimum ionizing particle\nas a function of the distance to the PMT is shown in Fig. 3. The PMT position\nis at X = 0 cm. The data were fitted in the region of the expected shower\nmaximum (3 to 10 X0 ) to a straight line in order to determine the slope of\nthe LY uniformity. The LY values were normalized to the value of LY at\nX = 11 cm.\nA distribution of the slopes of the LY uniformity was obtained for the groups\nof 25 crystals each from Bogoroditsk and Shanghai. The results are shown in\nFig. 4. No difference between the Bogoroditsk and the Shanghai crystals was\nobserved.\n6\n\n\fFig. 4. The distribution of the LY uniformity slope.\n\n5\n\nEnergy Resolution and Comparison With GEANT Simulations\n\nUsing the test beam setup described above the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter prototype (5\u00d75 matrix) were measured. The electron\nbeam was directed to the center of the matrix. To disentangle various contributions to the energy and position resolution six electron beam energies of 1,\n2, 5, 10, 27, and 45 GeV were used.\nTo measure a good energy resolution of the calorimeter prototype we had to\ntake into account a photomultiplier gain instability. Variations of the PMT\ngain were caused by the changes of the electron beam intensity. To monitor\nPMT gain we used LED pulser monitor system described above. Monitor\nsystem data were used to correct PMT gain. Fig. 5 (right), shows the average\npulse heights from LED pulser signals as a function of time. The left plot in\nFig. 5 shows a linear correlation between the average LED signal and electron\nbeam pulse height. The energy resolution before and after the PMT gain\ncorrection with the use of the LED data is presented in Fig. 6. All results\nbelow were obtained with PMT gain correction.\nThe energy resolution \u03c3E /E as a function of E is shown in Fig. 7. The energy\nresolution is described well using a function\n\u221a\n\u03c3E /E = a \u2295 b/ E \u2295 c/E [%],\n(1)\n7\n\n\fFig. 5.

(right) Dependence of the LED signal in\nADC counts vs the time (on the X axis). Each point is an average over 90 seconds.\nNote, the highly suppressed zero on the scales. (All data are at 27 GeV.)\n\nFig. 6. Energy resolution before and after the PMT gain correction using the LED\npulser information. Data are collected using a 27-GeV electron beam.\n\n8\n\n\fwhere E is in GeV, a represents a constant term arising from calibration errors,\nshower leakage, mostly from the back of the crystals, and non-uniformity in\nthe light collection efficiency along the length of the crystals. The stochastic\nterm, b = (1.8 \u00b1 0.1)%, arises from photon statistics and leakage of shower,\nmainly in the transverse directions outside the 5\u00d75 crystal array. The last term\nc = (2.4 \u00b1 0.2)%, sometimes called a noise term, usually arises from noise of\nthe photon detection electronics, which was negligible in our case. Instead,\nthe momentum measurement resolution arising from multiple scattering of\nthe electrons in the beam line is estimated to contribute 2.2% to this term\nand is, in fact, consistent with what we observe.\nThe measured constant term is a = (0.33 \u00b1 0.02)%. Our Monte Carlo studies\nshow that the shower fluctuation and non-uniformity contribute 0.23% and\n0.27%, respectively. The measured longitudinal non-uniformities were used as\ninputs in this Monte Carlo study. Adding these contributions in quadrature\n\nFig. 7. Measured energy resolution of the 5 \u00d7 5 crystal matrix. A curve shows\nexperimental data fit result.\n\n9\n\n\fwe estimate the constant term to be 0.35%, which is consistent with what we\nmeasure.\nThe same Monte Carlo studies show that shower fluctuation results in 0.72%\ncontribution to b. To estimate the other major contributions in the b term\nwe need to know the photo-electron yield. The vendors of the crystals BTCP\n(Bogoroditsk Techno-Chemical Plant), Russia and SIC (Shanghai Institute of\nCeramics), China measured this number to be about 10 pe/MeV using Cs137\nand Co60 gamma sources and 2\" PMT's with bialkali photo cathode, covering\nthe entire crystal end. Since the PMT's used in the beam test have sensitive\nareas of (22 \u00b1 1) mm diameter attached to the crystal ends measuring 27 mm\nsquare, the covered area is only (52 \u00b1 5)%. This implies that photo-electron\nyield in our beam test studies is 5 pe/MeV, and its contribution in the b term\nis (1.45 \u00b1 0.07)%. Combining these two contributions as well as an additional\nsmall contribution from the LY non-uniformity to the b term, we expect the\nstochastic term to be (1.68 \u00b1 0.07)%, which is consistent with the measured\nvalue of (1.8 \u00b1 0.1)%. We did not see big difference in energy resolution for\ncrystals produced in Bogoroditsk and Shanghai.\nThe results of GEANT version 3.21 [4] Monte Carlo predictions are compared\nwith the data in Fig. 8. Curve I includes the effects of shower fluctuation and\nleakages for our particular crystal size. The light yield non-uniformity along\nthe crystal contribution is added on curve II. Photon statistics is included into\nthe calculations in curve III. Dots in the Fig. 8 represent the experimental data\nwhich had have the effects of multiple scattering of the beam electrons and\ntagging system resolution removed.\nWe studied the dependence of the energy resolution on the angle of electron\nincidence on the crystals. No changes were observed up to a few degrees. In\nthe 5\u00d75 crystal array it began to deteriorate at angles greater than 5\u25e6 (see\nFig. 9). The effect is more-or-less constant over the energy range we studied.\n\n6\n\nTemperature Dependence of the Crystal Light Output\n\nWe made an independent measurement of a temperature variation effect on\nthe PbWO4 crystal light output. The temperature dependence measurements\nwere made at electron energies of 10 and 27 GeV. The rate of the temperature\nchange was about 1 \u25e6 C/hour during both the warm up and the cool down\nperiods. The temperature inside the box was measured using our 24 thermistors array, averaging the values. The temperature was measured once per spill\n(approximately 0.1 Hz). The slope of the change in the vicinity of 18 \u25e6 C was\nfound to be about -2% per \u25e6 C, in agreement with previous measurements.\nFig. 10 shows our measurements with 10 and 27 GeV electrons.\n10\n\n\f\u03c3\u0395/\u0395, %\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\nIII\n\n0.4\n\nII\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\nI\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\nE, GeV\n\n\u03c3\u0395(\u0398)/\u03c3\u0395(0)\n\nFig. 8.

We use only events with an electron hitting the central\ncrystal of the array for the further analysis to avoid shower leakage outside\nmatrix.\nIn this analysis, the crystals were divided into virtual squares of 1 mm2 . During\nthe accumulation of the data for shower profiles three two-dimensional arrays\n135\u00d7135 were used, where the two dimensions stood for x and y coordinates\nperpendicular to the beam. Each cell of the arrays corresponded to the 1 mm2\nof the crystal matrix. Each of the arrays contained number of events, the\nenergy sum, and the sum of the energy squared correspondingly. For any\nselected event only 25 cells in each of these arrays were used for accumulation.\nCoordinates of each cell to be filled were determined by the distances x and y\nof the center of each out of 25 crystals in the matrix relative to the electron\ncoordinates determined by the drift chambers.\nAfter the accumulation of the data was done, the arrays were modified. Considering a symmetry of the shower profile in the both projections, only 1/8 of\nthe full arrays are left. Thus we mapped the information from the cells symmetrical relative to the center of the 5\u00d75 matrix. Finally three \"triangular\"\ntables (the 5\u00d75 crystal matrix viewed from the center of the matrix appears\nas a triangle with 68 cells along the two equal sides, that is along 2.5 crystals\nwith a step of 1 mm) were determined. The first one contained the number of\nevents accumulated for each cell, the second one contained an average energy\n12\n\n\fFig. 11. Electromagnetic shower lateral profile for 45 GeV electrons.\n\ndeposit in particular cell, and the third one contained the r.m.s. (\u03c3) of this\naverage energy deposit. Each final table had 2346 elements. These tables were\naccumulated for the energies 1, 2, 5, 10, 27, and 45 GeV. The energy sharing\ninformation is important for developing an algorithm of a reconstruction of\ntwo gamma-quanta from two strongly overlapped showers at different energies.\nA typical electromagnetic shower profile, for 45 GeV electrons, is presented in\nFig. 11. It defines an average energy deposit, normalized on the total energy\ndeposit in the 5\u00d75 crystal array, in the crystal with a distance X between\nits center and an electron X-coordinate. The electron Y -coordinate here is\nwithin 1 mm slice of the crystal center. We found that the lateral shower profile\nchanges very slightly in the energy range 1\u201345 GeV. When an electron hits the\nsquare of 4\u00d74 mm2 in the center of middle crystal of the calorimeter prototype,\nabout 76% of the full energy is deposited in this crystal. The dependence of\nthe energy deposit on energy is presented in Fig. 12. In Table 1 the relative\nenergy deposit (in %) in the six crystals when an electron hits the square of\n4\u00d74 mm2 in the center of the matrix is presented. These six counters reproduce\n13\n\n\fRelative Energy Deposit,%\n\n82\n81\n\nMC simulation\n\n80\n79\n78\n77\n\nExperimental points\n\n76\n5\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nEnergy,GeV\nFig. 12.

Electrons hit a square of 4 \u00d7 4 mm2 in the center of the matrix.\n\nthe triangle matrix obtained as described above when each cell of the arrays\ncorresponds to a crystal. The upper lines of the numbers stand for an average\nover 1 and 2 GeV, while the bottom lines show values for 45 GeV. We see that\nwhile the energy changes by about a factor of 30, the shower profiles changes\nby only 1% in the center and at most 10% at the edges.\nThe test beam results on the electromagnetic shower lateral profile have been\ncompared with the GEANT 3.21 simulation results with tracing cuts of 500 KeV\nfor electrons/positrons and 60 KeV for photons. The GEANT 4 simulation\nwith the same tracing cuts and with the much lower 1 KeV production and\ntracing cuts gives very similar results. The GEANT simulation indicates that\nthe simulated shower transverse profile does not change with the incoming\nenergy. About 82% of the energy collected over 5 \u00d7 5 matrix is predicted by\nGEANT to be in the central crystal, but our measurements show only about\n76-77%. GEANT does better when considering the fraction of the energy contained in the 3 \u00d7 3 sub-array; GEANT predicts 97%, while the measurement\n14\n\n\fTable 1\nEnergy deposit in % when an electron hits the center of the crystal matrix.

It is also interesting that the shower profile simulated with GEANT is\na bit narrower in comparison to the experimental result. One of the possible\nexplanations may be Cherenkov's effect light contribution.\n\n8\n\nPosition Resolution and Comparison With GEANT Simulations\n\nThe position resolution of the calorimeter prototype was also obtained using\nthe test beam data. We used the center-of-gravity technique to define the\nmeasured coordinate in the crystal matrix and the drift chambers to define\nthe true coordinate of the particle hitting the crystals. This method requires\nthe knowledge of the energy and the angle of incidence of the particle in order\nto choose the right correction curve (so called, the S-curve) which will be used\nto correct the measured position. The measured position xmeas is defined as\nfollows:\nxmeas =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nEi * xi /\n\nn\nX\n\nEi ,\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Ei is the energy deposited in the i-th crystal and xi is the position of\nits center, relative to (0,0) for the central crystal, and n refers to the number\nof crystals in the sum. While for the energy resolution it is better to take\nn = 25, for the spatial resolution n prefers to be taken as 9 due to the influence\nof large energy fluctuations in the tails of an electromagnetic shower on the\nspatial resolution. The measured position versus the true position for 27 Gev\nelectrons for normal incidence is presented in Fig. 13 (S-curve). The weighted\nsum (2) biases the measurement towards the center of the crystal as can\nbeen seen in this figure. For normal incidence the correction S-curve is almost\nindependent of energy, most likely due to the fact that the Moliere radius has\na negligible energy dependence. The S-curve fit function was used to obtain\n15\n\n\fXcalc, cm\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nXtrue, cm\n\nFig. 13.

The dependence of the calculated coordinate in the\nPbWO4 matrix on the true coordinate defined by the drift chambers for 27\nGeV electrons is presented in Fig. 14. The width of the line in Fig. 14 gives\nthe calorimeter prototype position resolution.\nThe resolution, averaged over electrons spread across the entire central crystal\nwas calculated for several beam energies. The results are shown in Fig. 15. We\nobtained the following dependence of resolution on energy\n\n\u03c3x = (0.16 \u00b1 0.06) \u2295\n\n2.80 \u00b1 0.08\n\u221a\n,\nE\n16\n\n(3)\n\n\fXcalc, cm\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nXtrue, cm\n\nFig. 14.

We see\nthat the spatial resolution is better by almost a factor of three the edge of the\ncrystal relative to the center. As shown in Figure 16, experimental resolution\nin the center of the crystall is better than MC simulation, since GEANT\nsimulated shower is a bit narrower than measured.\nIn order to study the dependence of position resolution on the angle at which\nan electron hits the calorimeter prototype, the crystal matrix was turned by\n17\n\n\f\u03c3X, mm\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nE, GeV\n\n\u03c3X, mm\n\nFig. 15.

The\ndependence of position resolution on angle relative to the one at zero degree\nincidence for 10 GeV and 27 GeV electrons is given in Fig. 17. We see that\nposition resolution at 15 degrees is worse than at zero degree by a factor of\n1.5 at 10 GeV and 2.5 at 27 GeV.

When the matrix is turned at some angle, the additional contribution in position resolution comes from longitudinal fluctuations\nof the electromagnetic shower maximum. The geometrical factor of this effect\nis proportional to sin \u03b8.\n19\n\n\f9\n\nConclusion\n\nThe measurements of energy and position resolutions of Our electromagnetic\ncalorimeter prototype made of lead tungstate crystals for the BTeV experiment at Fermilab have been carried out at the IHEP test beam facility at\nthe Protvino 70 GeV accelerator. The crystals were produced in Bogoroditsk\n(Russia) and Shanghai (China) and were assembled in 5x5 arrays.\nStudies were made in the electron beam energy range from 1 to 45 GeV. The\nenergy tagged beam has allowed us to measure the stochastic term in energy\nresolution as (1.8\u00b10.1)%. We have not seen significant difference in energy\nresolution of the Bogoroditsk and Shanghai crystals. The non-uniformity of\nlight yield along the crystal has been measured with the use of the muon beam\nwhen the crystal matrix was rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the beam\ndirection. Taking into account this effect as well as photostatistics has resulted\nin good agreement between the measured energy resolutions and the GEANT\nMonte Carlo simulations.\nThe stochastic term in the dependence of position resolution on energy in\nour measurements is about 2.8 mm which is in agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations. For 27 GeV electrons position resolution is 750 \u03bcm in the center\nof the crystal, and is 250 \u03bcm at a boundary between two crystals.\nThe dependence of energy resolution on the angle at which particle hits the\ncrystals relative to the normal has been measured. Energy resolution does not\ndeteriorate until the angle is about 5\u25e6 . But there is significant dependence of\nposition resolution on the angle. The position resolution at 15\u25e6 is worse than at\n0\u25e6 by a factor of 1.5 at 10 GeV and 2.5 times for 27 GeV. Projective geometry\nrather than planar geometry has been chosen for the BTeV calorimeter.\nThe electromagnetic shower lateral profile changes very slightly in the energy\nrange 1\u201345 GeV. When an electron hits the center of the calorimeter prototype\nmade of a PbWO4 with the size 27 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 220 mm3 , about 76% of the full\nenergy is deposited in the central crystal. Shower shape tables were measured\nfor six energies within 1\u201345 GeV region. It will be important for developing\nan algorithm of a reconstruction of two gamma-quanta from two overlapped\nshowers at different energies. The shower profile simulated with GEANT is a\nbit narrower in comparison to the experimental result.\nThe temperature dependence of a crystal light output was measured to be\n-2.3%/\u25e6 C (at 18 \u25e6 C) for two electron beam energies, 10 and 27 GeV.\n20\n\n\f10\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank the IHEP management for providing us a beam line\nand accelerator time for our test beam studies.
