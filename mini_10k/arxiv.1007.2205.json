Let X be a reflexive Banach space. In this paper we give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for an operator T \u2208 K(X) to have the best approximation in numerical\nradius from the convex subset U \u2282 K(X), where K(X) denotes the set of all linear, compact\noperators from X into X. We will also present an application to minimal extensions with\nrespect to the numerical radius. In particular some results on best approximation in norm\nwill be generalized to the case of the numerical radius.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nLet X be a Banach space over R or C, we use BX for the closed unit ball and SX\nfor the unit sphere of X. The dual space is denoted by X \u2217 and the Banach algebra\nof all continuous linear operators on X is denoted by B(X). The numerical range of\nT \u2208 B(X) is defined by\nW (T ) = {x\u2217 (T x) : x \u2208 SX , x\u2217 \u2208 SX \u2217 , x\u2217 (x) = 1}*\nThe numerical radius of T is then given by\nk T kw = sup{|\u03bb| : \u03bb \u2208 W (T )}*\nClearly, k . kw is a semi-norm on B(X) and k T kw \u2264 kT k for all T \u2208 B(X). Therefore,\nthere are more operators for which kT k \u2265 1 but k T kw = 1 and this gives a motivation\nto study both the minimal projections and the best approximation with respect to\nk * kw . Naturally for kT k we are taking \"the supremum\" over (x, x\u2217 ) \u2208 B(X)\u00d7B(X \u2217 ),\nbut for k T kw \"the supremum\" is taken over those (x, x\u2217 ) for which x\u2217 (x) = 1.\nThe numerical index of X is defined by\nn(X) = inf{k T kw : T \u2208 SB(X) }*\nEquivalently, the numerical index n(X) is the largest constant k \u2265 0 such that\nkkT k \u2264k T kw\nfor every T \u2208 B(X). Note also that 0 \u2264 n(X) \u2264 1, and n(X) > 0 if and only if k * kw\nand k * k are equivalent norms.\nThe concept of numerical index was first introduced by Lumer [35] in 1968. Since\nthen much attention has been paid to this constant of equivalence between the numerical radius and the usual norm in the Banach algebra of all bounded linear operators\n0 Mathematics\n\nSubject Classification (2000): 41A35, 41A65, 47A12, 47H10.\n\nKey words: Numerical index, Numerical radius, Best approximation, Strongly unique\nbest approximation, Minimal extensions .\n\n1\n\n\fof a Banach space. Classical references here are [6], [7]. For recent results we refer the\nreader to [1], [2], [17], [18],[20], [33], [36].\nExistence and uniqueness of best approximation in particular subsets of U \u2282 B(X)\nin the operator norm is one of the basic questions of approximation theory. One very\nimportant case of U is a set of all linear continuous projections from a Banach space\nX onto its subspaces Y. More precisely, let Y \u2282 X be a linear, closed subspace. A\nlinear map P : X \u2192 Y is called a projection if P y = y for any y \u2208 Y. Clearly, if\nY 6= {0}, then kP k \u2265 1 for any projection P . The set of all projections going from X\nonto Y will be denoted by P(X, Y ). Minimal projections play a special role among all\nprojections. A projection Po \u2208 P(X, Y ) is called minimal if\nkPo k = inf{kP k : P \u2208 P(X, Y )} = dist(0, P(X, Y ))}.\nThere is a lot of previous research concerning minimal projections. Primarily this work\naddresses problems of finding minimal projections effectively and estimating norms of\nminimal projections and uniqueness of minimal projections. (e.g [1], [8]-[16], [19], [21],\n[22]-[29], [31], [32], [34], [37], [38], [40]-[42], [44]).\nNow suppose that V is a subset of a Banach space X and x0 \u2208 X \\ V . Denote by\nPV (xo ) the set of all best approximants to x0 in V. We say v0 \u2208 V is a strongly unique\nbest approximation (SUBA) to x0 if and only if there exists r > 0 such that for all\nu\u2208V\nkx0 \u2212 uk \u2265 kx0 \u2212 v0 k + rku \u2212 v0 k.\nIt is clear that if v0 is a SUBA then vo \u2208 PV (xo ). It is also easy to see that vo\nis the only element of best approximation. There are natural examples of SUBA.\nHere we mention the most important one. Let X = C[0, 1] and Vn be the subspace\nof polynomials of degree less than or equal to n. If f is any element of C[0, 1] and\nP0 \u2208 PVn (f ) then P0 is a SUBA to f .\nAlso strong unicity can be applied in the proof of the SUBA Theorem ([12], p.80\nin the case of polynomial approximation) concerning the Lipschitz continuity of the\nbest approximation operator. More precisely, let V \u2282 X and (xn ) \u2208 X with xn \u2192 x.\nSuppose PV (xn ) is a best approximation to xn in V and x has a SUBA element PV (x)\nwith the constant r > 0. Then\nkPV (xn ) \u2212 PV (x)k \u2264\n\n2\nkxn \u2212 xk.\nr\n\nAlso, the strong unicity constant plays a crucial role in the estimate of the error of\nthe Remez algorithm (see [12], p.97). For further details concerning strong unicity we\nrefer to [5], [12], [25], [26], [43].\nThe aim of this paper is to prove some criteria for best approximation and SUBA\nwith respect to the numerical radius and some related seminorms. More precisely, let\nX be a reflexive Banach space (we consider both the real and the complex cases) and\nlet K(X) denote the set of all compact oparators from X into X. Let us consider\nB = BX \u2217 \u00d7 BX\n\u2217\n\n(1.1)\n\nwith the Tychonoff topology induced by the weak -topology in BX \u2217 and by the weaktopology in BX . By the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem and the Tychonoff Theorem, B is\na compact set. Assume that W \u2282 B is a fixed, non-empty and compact subset of B.\nDefine for L \u2208 K(X)\nkLkW = sup{|x\u2217 (Lx)| : (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 W }.\n\n2\n\n\fIt is clear that k * kW is a semi-norm on K(X). Let\nW(X) = K(X)/(R),\nwhere (R) is an equivalence relation on K(X) \u00d7 K(X) defined by\nL (R) T if and only if kL \u2212 T kW = 0.\nNote that W becomes a Banach space with the norm\nk[L]kW = kLkW .\nHere the symbol [L] denotes the equivalence class of L with respect to (R).\nIn this paper we prove some criteria for best approximation and SUBA in the\nquotient space W(X) where X is a reflexive space. Also an application to minimal\nextensions with respect to the numerical radius will be presented. It is worth noticing\nthat [1] gives a characterization of minimal numerical-radius extensions of operators\nfrom a normed linear space X onto its finite dimensional subspaces and comparison\nwith minimal operator-norm extension.\nWe will use the following results throughout the paper. Let X be a Banach space\nand let ext(SX \u2217 ) denote the set of all extreme points of SX \u2217 . For any x \u2208 X set\nE(x) = {f \u2208 ext(SX \u2217 ) : f (x) = kxk}.\nWe have E(x) 6= \u2205 for any x \u2208 X, by the Banach-Alao\u011flu Theorem and the KreinMilman Theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. [5] Let V \u2282 X be a convex set and let xo \u2208 X. Then vo \u2208 V is a best\napproximation to xo in V if and only if for any v \u2208 V there exists f \u2208 E(x \u2212 vo ) with\nre(f (v \u2212 vo )) \u2264 0.\nIf V is a linear subspace, the above inequality can be replaced by\nre(f (v)) \u2264 0.\nHere for z \u2208 C, the symbol re(z) denotes the real part of z.\nTheorem 1.2. [43] Let V \u2282 X be a convex set and let xo \u2208 X. Then vo \u2208 V is a\nSUBA to xo in V with r > 0 if and only if for any v \u2208 V there exists f \u2208 E(x \u2212 vo )\nwith the following:\nre(f (v \u2212 vo )) \u2264 \u2212rkv \u2212 vo k\nIf V is a linear subspace the above inequality can be replaced by\nre(f (v)) \u2264 \u2212rkvk.\n\n2\n\nMain Results\n\nIn the complex case define for any \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]\nW\u03b8 = {(ei\u03b8 x\u2217 , x) : (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 W }\nand\nZ=\n\n[\n\u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0]\n\n3\n\nW\u03b8 .\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fSet for any T \u2208 W(X)\nWT = {(x\u2217 , x) \u2208 Z : x\u2217 (T x) = k[T ]kW }.\n\n(2.2)\n\nObserve that the above definition does not depend on a particular representation of\n[T ]. To define WT in the real case we should replace the set Z by\nZR = W \u222a {(\u2212x\u2217 , x) : (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 W }.\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe start with\nLemma 2.1. For any T \u2208 W, WT 6= \u2205.\nProof. Fix [T ] \u2208 W(X). First we consider the complex case. Since W is a compact\nset, the set Z defined by (2.1) is a compact set too. Fix L \u2208 [T ]. Define a function\n\u03a6(L) : Z \u2192 C by\n\u03a6(L)((ei\u03b8 x\u2217 , x)) = ei\u03b8 (x\u2217 Lx).\nNow we show that \u03a6(L) is a continuous function.\nTo do this, fix a net {z\u03b3 = (x\u2217\u03b3 , x\u03b3 )} \u2282 Z tending to z = (x\u2217 , x). Assume on the\ncontrary that \u03a6(L)(z\u03b3 ) does not converge to \u03a6(L)(z). Notice that Lx\u03b3 \u2192 Lx in the\nweak topology. Since L is a compact operator, passing to a subnet, if necessary, we\ncan assume that kLx\u03b3 \u2212 Lxk \u2192 0. Consequently,\n|x\u2217\u03b3 Lx\u03b3 \u2212 x\u2217 Lx| \u2264 |x\u2217\u03b3 (Lx\u03b3 \u2212 Lx) + (x\u2217\u03b3 \u2212 x\u2217 )Lx|\n\u2264 kLx\u03b3 \u2212 Lxk + |(z\u03b3\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 )Lx| \u2192\u03b3 0.\nwhich is a contradiction. Since \u03a6(L) is continuous and Z is a compact set there exists\nzo \u2208 Z such that\n\u03a6(L)(zo ) = sup{|\u03c6(L)(z)| : z \u2208 Z},\nwhich shows that WT 6= \u2205, as required.\nThe proof in the real case goes exactly in the same way with Z replaced by ZR defined\nby (2.3).\nTheorem 2.2. Let X be a reflexive Banach space and W \u2282 B be a fixed, non-empty,\ncompact subset of B. Let U \u2282 W(X) be a non-empty convex subset of W(X). An\nelement L \u2208 U is a best approximation to T \u2208 W(X) if and only if for any U \u2208 U\nthere exists (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 WT such that\nre(x\u2217 (U \u2212 L)x) \u2264 0.\n\n(2.4)\n\nProof. First we consider the complex case. Take Z defined by (2.1). Let C(Z) denote\nthe space of all continuous, complex-valued or real-valued functions defined on Z\nequipped with the supremum norm k * ksup . Let \u03a6 : W(X) \u2192 C(Z) be defined by\n\u03a6([L])(x\u2217 , x) = x\u2217 Lx\nfor any (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 Z. Reasoning as in Lemma (2.1) we can show, applying compactness\nof L, that \u03a6[L] is a continuous function on Z, where Z is endowed with the topology\ninduced from B given by (1.1). Moreover, \u03a6 is a linear isometry. Consequently L is a\nbest approximation to T in U if and only if \u03a6(L) is a best approximation to \u03a6(T ) in\n\u03a6(U). By Theorem (1.1) and the form of extreme points of the unit sphere in C \u2217 (Z),\n\n4\n\n\fthis is equivalent to the fact that for any \u03a6(U ) \u2208 \u03a6(U) there exist (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 Z such\nthat \u03a6(T \u2212 L)(x\u2217 , x) = k\u03a6(T \u2212 L)ksup and\nRe((\u03a6(U ) \u2212 \u03a6(L))(x\u2217 , x)) = re(x\u2217 (U \u2212 L)x) \u2264 0,\nwhich completes the proof in the complex case. The proof in the real case goes in the\nsame way with Z replaced by ZR given by (2.3).\nApplying Theorem (1.2) and a similar reasoning used in Theorem (2.2) we can\nprove:\nTheorem 2.3. Let X be a reflexive Banach space and W \u2282 B be a fixed, non-empty,\ncompact subset of B. Let U \u2282 W(X) be a non-empty convex subset of W(X). An\nelement L \u2208 U is a SUBA to T \u2208 W(X) with r > 0 if and only if for any U \u2208 U there\nexists (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 WT such that\nx\u2217 (U \u2212 L)x \u2264 \u2212rkU \u2212 Lkw\nRemark 2.4. Note that in Theorem (2.2) and Theorem (2.3) we can replace set WT\nby\nET = WT \u2229 (ext(SX \u2217 ) \u00d7 ext(SX )).\nIndeed let (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 WT satisfy re(x\u2217 (U \u2212 L)x) \u2264 0. Set\nNx = {z \u2217 \u2208 BX \u2217 : z \u2217 (x) = kxk = 1}.\nIt is clear that Nx is a nonempty, convex set and that ext(Wx ) \u2282 ext(SX \u2217 ). Consider\na function\ng(w\u2217 ) = re(w\u2217 (U \u2212 L)x).\nSince g is a linear functional on X \u2217 and re(x\u2217(U \u2212 L)x) \u2264 0, there exists z \u2217 in\next(SX \u2217 ) = ext(Wx ) with\nre(z \u2217 (U \u2212 L)x) \u2264 0.\nNow set\nNz \u2217 = {x \u2208 BX : z \u2217 (x) = kz \u2217 k = 1}.\nSince X is reflexive, by the James Theorem Nz \u2217 6= \u2205. Reasoning as we did above, we\nget that there exists z \u2208 extSX satisfying z \u2217 (z) = 1 with\nre(z \u2217 (U \u2212 L)z) \u2264 0,\nwhich shows our claim in the case of Theorem (2.2). The same reasoning works in the\ncase of Theorem (2.3).\nRemark 2.5. Note that in Theorem (2.2) and Theorem (2.3) we can replace K(X) by\nany subspcace D of K(X). In this case the equivalence relation (R) should be replaced\nby its restriction to D \u00d7 D.\nCorollary 2.6. Assume that X is a finite-dimensional space. For any number q with\n0 < q \u2264 1, set\nWq = {(x\u2217 , x) : x\u2217 (x) = q}.\nAlso define \"q-numerical range\" for T \u2208 B(X) by\nWq (T ) = {x\u2217 (T x) : kxk = kx\u2217 k = 1 (x, x\u2217 ) = q }\n\n5\n\n\fand\nkT kWq = sup{|\u03bb| : \u03bb \u2208 Wq (T )}.\nThen the conclusion of Theorems (2.2) and Theorem (2.3) remain true for the best\napproximation in W(X) with respect to k * kWq . If we put q = 1 we get criteria for the\nbest approximation with respect to the numerical radius.\nProof. Since X is finite-dimensional, the set Wq is a compact subset of B. Hence\nTheorem (2.2) and Theorem (2.3) can be applied to k * kWq .\nFor more details on q-numerical range we refer to [3].\nRemark 2.7. If X is reflexive and W = B = BX \u2217 \u00d7 BX , Theorem (2.2) and Theorem\n(2.3) have been proved in [37])(see also [26]).\n\n3\n\nAn Application\n\nInvestigating minimal projections in P(X, V ) \u2282 B(X) with respect to various seminorms on B(X) raises the question of on what subspaces of B(X) semi-norms are\nactually norms. The following lemma provides an answer to this question in the case\nof the numerical radius k * kw .\nLemma 3.1. Let X be a Banach space, V its n-dimensional subspace, and\nBV (X, V ) = {L \u2208 B(X, V ) : L|V = 0}.\nLet for A \u2208 B(V ),\nkAkw = sup{|v \u2217 Av| : (v \u2217 \u2208 BV \u2217 , V \u2208 BV , v \u2217 (v) = 1}.\nSuppose A \u2208 B(V ) \\ {0} with kAkw > 0 and A0 \u2208 B(X, V ) with A0 |V = A a fixed\noperator. Consider a subspace\nZA \u2282 BV (X, V )\ndefined by\nZA = span[A0 ] \u2295 BV (X, V )\nwhere by span[A0 ] we mean the subspace spanned by A0 . Then the semi-norm k.kw\ndefined with respect to the subspace ZA is actually a norm on ZA .\nProof. Let L \u2208 ZA \\{0}; we want to show kLkw > 0. Since L \u2208 ZA , then L = \u03b1A0 +L1\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 R and L1 \u2208 BV (X, V ).\nCase 1. Assume \u03b1 6= 0 :\nFrom our assumption kAkw > 0, we know that for some v \u2208 S(V ) and v \u2217 \u2208 S(V \u2217 )\nwith v \u2217 (v) = 1 we have |v \u2217 Av| > 0. Let x\u2217 \u2208 SX \u2217 be the Hahn-Banach extension of\nv \u2217 to X, then\nx\u2217 Lv = \u03b1x\u2217 A0 v + x\u2217 (L1 v).\nSince L1 v = 0 and A0 |V = A, x\u2217 Lv = \u03b1x\u2217 Av with \u03b1 6= 0 and |v \u2217 Av| > 0 and therefore\nkLkw > 0.\nCase 2. Assume \u03b1 = 0 :\nk\nX\nLet L \u2208 BV (X, V ) \\ {0} and set L =\nfi (*)vi where v1 , v2 , * * * , vk \u2208 V \\ {0} and\nf1 , f2 , *, fk \u2208 X \u2217 are such that\n\ni=1\n\n6\n\n\f\u2022 fi |V = 0 for i = 1, 2, * * * k\n\u2022 {fi }ki=1 is a linearly independent set.\nLet\n\nk\n\\\n\nX1 =\n\nker(fi ) and X2 =\n\nk\n\\\n\nker(fi ).\n\ni=2\n\ni=1\n\n(We put X2 = X if k = 1).\nSince {fi }ki=1 is linearly independent, we know V \u2282 X1\nX2 . Fix x \u2208 X2 \\ X1\nsuch that 0 \u2208\n/ PV1 (x) where V1 = span[v1 ]. By PV1 (x) we mean the set of best\napproximation to x from V1 . Without loss of generality assume kxk = 1.\nThen by the Hahn-Banach Theorem for any x\u2217 \u2208 S(X \u2217 ) with x\u2217 (x) = 1, we have\n\u2217\nx (v1 ) 6= 0 and hence\nx\u2217 Lx = x\u2217 (\n\nk\nX\n\nfi (x)vi ) = x\u2217 (f1 (x))v1 = f1 (x)x\u2217 (v1 ) 6= 0\n\ni=1\n\ngiving again kLkw > 0.\nRemark 3.2. Note that kIdV kw = 1. Hence k.kw is actually a norm in restriction to\nZIdV .\nIn [38] it was shown that for any three dimensional real Banach space X and any\nof its two dimensional subspace V if the infimum with respect to the operator norm\nover P(X, V ) is greater than one, then there exists the unique projection of minimal\noperator norm. Later in [25] (see also [26]) this result was generalized as follows:\nLet X be a three dimensional real Banach space and V a two dimensional subspace of\nX. Suppose A \u2208 B(V ) is a fixed operator. Set\nPA (X, Y ) = {P \u2208 B(X, Y ) : P |Y = A }\nand assume k P0 k>k A k, where P0 \u2208 PA (X, Y ) is an extension of minimal operator\nnorm. Then P0 is a SUBA minimal extension with respect to the operator norm.\nIn other words for all P \u2208 PA (X, Y ) one has\nkP k \u2265 kP0 k + r kP \u2212 P0 k\nDefinition 3.3. We say an operator 0 is a SUBA to Ao with respect to numerical\nradius in B(X) if A0 |V = A and there exists r > 0 such that\nkBkw \u2265 kA0 kw + r kB \u2212 A0 kw\nfor any B \u2208 B(X, V ) with B|V = A.\nA natural extension of the above result to k * kw is as follows:\nTheorem 3.4. Assume that X is a three dimensional real Banach space and let V be\na two dimensional subspace of X, and that A \u2208 B(V ) with kAkw > 0. Let\nA\n\u03bbA\nw = \u03bbw (X, V ) = inf{kA0 kw : A0 \u2208 B(X, V )\n\nA0 |V = A} > kAk,\n\nwhere kAk denotes the operator norm. Then there exists exactly one A0 \u2208 B(X, V )\nsuch that A0 |V = A and\n\u03bbA\nw = kA0 kw .\nMoreover, 0 is a SUBA to Ao with respect to numerical radius in BV (X, V ).\n\n7\n\n\fProof. Since kAkw > 0, by Lemma(3.1) k * kw is a norm on ZA . Since X is finitedimensional, any operator L \u2208 ZA posseses a best approximation in BV (X, V ) with\nrespect to the k * kw . Hence there exists Ao \u2208 PA (X, V ) such that kAo kw = \u03bbA\nw . Let\nWAo be defined by (2.2). Set for any (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 X \u2217 \u00d7 X and L \u2208 B(X)\n(x\u2217 \u2297 x)(L) = x\u2217 (Lx).\nNote that x\u2217 \u2297 x is a linear, continuous functional on B(X) for any (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 X \u2217 \u00d7 X.\nLet\nC = {x\u2217 \u2297 x : (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 WAo }.\nFirst we show that 0 \u2208 conv(C|BV (X,V ) ). Assume that this is not true. Since X is\nfinite-dimensional and C is a compact set, by the Carath\u00e9odory Theorem (see [12])\nconv(C|BV (X,V ) ) is also a compact set. Since 0 \u2208\n/ conv(C|BV (X,V ) ), by the Separation\nTheorem there exists L \u2208 BV (X, V ) such that\n(x\u2217 \u2297 x)(L) = x\u2217 (Lx) > 0\nfor any (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 WAo . By Theorem (2.2) applied to Ao and BV (X, V ), it follows that\nAo is not a minimal extension of A which is a contradiction. Consequently,\n0=\n\nk\nX\n\naj (x\u2217j \u2297 xj )|BV (X,V ) ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nj=1\n\nP\nwhere aj > 0 and kj=1 aj = 1. Let ko = min{k : k satisfies 3.1}. Note that\ndim(BV (X, V )) = 2, since dim(X) = 3, and dim(V ) = 2. Hence by the Carath\u00e9odory\nTheorem, (see [12]),we conclude that ko \u2264 3.\nNow we show that ko = 3. Assume this is not true. If ko = 1, then\n(x\u2217 \u2297 x)|BV (X,V ) = 0 for some (x\u2217 , x) \u2208 WAo . Fix f \u2208 X \u2217 \\ {0} satisfying V = ker(f ).\nSince\nkAo kw > kAk \u2265 kAkw\nit follows that f (x) 6= 0. Take L \u2208 BV (X, V ) given by Lz = f (z)Ao x. Note that\nx\u2217 (Lx) = f (x)x\u2217 (Ao x) = f (x)kAo kw 6= 0,\nwhich leads to a contradiction. Now assume that ko = 2. Then\n0 = a1 (x\u2217 \u2297 x)|BV (X,V ) + a2 (y \u2217 \u2297 y)|BV (X,V )\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere a1 > 0, a2 > 0 and a1 + a2 = 1. First we show that x and y are linearly\nindependent. If not, since kxk = kyk = 1, we have x = y or x = \u2212y. By (3.2) taking\nL = f (*)Ao x we get\n0 = a1 f (x)kAo kw + (1 \u2212 a1 )f (x)kAo kw\nwhich gives f (x) = 0. Hence kAo kw = kAkw \u2264 kAk which is a contradiction.\nNow we show that x\u2217 |V = by \u2217 |V for some b 6= 0. Note that, since x\u2217 (Ao x) =\n\u2217\ny (Ao y) = kAko , we have x\u2217 |V 6= 0 and y \u2217 |V 6= 0. If x\u2217 |V and y \u2217 |V were linearly\nindependent, then we could find v1 \u2208 V such that x\u2217 (v1 ) = 1 and y \u2217 (v1 ) = 0. Set\nS = f (*)v1 . By (3.2) applied to S we get\n0 = a1 f (x)x\u2217 (v1 ) = a1 f (x).\n\n8\n\n\fSince f (x) 6= 0, it follows that a1 = 0 is a contradiction. By (3.2) applied to L =\nf (*)Ao y we get\n0 = a1 bf (x)y \u2217 (Ao y) + (1 \u2212 a1 )f (y)y \u2217 (Ao y) = kAo kw (f (a1 bx + (1 \u2212 a1 )y)\nand consequently f (a1 bx + (1 \u2212 a1 )y) = 0. Since f (x) 6= 0 and f (y) 6= 0, we can find\nexactly one c1 > 0 such that f (c1 x + (1 \u2212 c1 )y) = 0 if f (x)f (y) < 0 or\nf (c1 (\u2212x) + (1 \u2212 c1 )y) = 0 if f (x)f (y) > 0.\nSince x and y are linearly independent we get that, b = 1 if f (x)f (y) > 0 and\nb = \u22121 if f (x)f (y) < 0. Consequently,\ny \u2217 (Ao (c1 x + (1 \u2212 c1 )y) = kAo kw\nif f (x)f (y) > 0 and\ny \u2217 (Ao (c1 (\u2212x) + (1 \u2212 c1 )y) = kAo kw\nif f (x)f (y) < 0. But this leads to kAo kw \u2264 kAk which is a contradiction. Hence we\nhave proved that ko = 3. By (3.1) we get\n0=\n\n3\nX\n\naj (x\u2217j \u2297 xj )|BV (X,V ) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere ai > 0, for i = 1, 2, 3 and a1 + a2 + a3 = 1.\nNow we show that for any i1 , i2 \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, i1 6= i2 , it follows that\ng1 = (x\u2217i1 \u2297 xi1 )|BV (X,V ) and g2 = (x\u2217i2 \u2297 xi2 )|BV (X,V ) are linearly independent. Without loss of generality we can assume that i1 = 1 and i2 = 2. If not, there exists a, b \u2208 R\nsuch that |a| + |b| > 0 and\nag1 + bg2 = 0.\n(3.4)\nSince ko = 3, we have a 6= 0, b 6= 0 and ab < 0. Without loss of generality, we can\nassume that a > 0. Multiplying (3.4) by \u2212a2 /b and adding it to (3.3) we get\n((a1 + a(\u2212a2 /b)(x\u22171 \u2297 x1 ) + a3 (x\u22173 \u2297 x3 ))|BV (X,V ) = 0.\nSince \u2212a2 /b > 0, and ko = 3, we get a contradiction, so g1 and g2 are linearly\nindependent.\nNow take any L \u2208 BV (X, V ), define with kLkw = 1. Since g1 and g2 are linearly\nindependent and by (3.3) there exists i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} such that (x\u2217i \u2297xi )(L) = x\u2217i (Lxi ) < 0.\nFor L \u2208 BV (X, V ), with kLkw = 1, define\ng(L) = min{(x\u2217i \u2297 xi )L : i = 1, 2, 3}.\nIt is clear that g is a continuous function on SBV (X,V ) and g(L) < 0 for any\nL \u2208 SBV (X,V ) . Since X is finite-dimensional, SBV (X,V ) is a compact set and\ns = sup{g(L) : L \u2208 SBV (X,V ) } < 0.\nNow take any L \u2208 BV (X, V ) \\ {0}. Then there exists i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} such that\ng(L/kLkw ) = (x\u2217i \u2297 xi )(L/kLkw ) \u2264 s.\nTheorem (2.3) implies that 0 is a SUBA to Ao , with r = \u2212s, and the proof is complete.\n\n9\n\n\fNotice if we take A = idV then kAkw = kAko = 1. In this situation Theorem (3.4)\ntakes the following form.\nTheorem 3.5. Assume that X is a three dimensional real Banach space and let V be\nits two dimensional subspace. Assume that\nV\n> 1.\n\u03bbid\nw\n\nThen there exists exactly one P0 \u2208 P(X, V ) of minimal norm. Moreover 0 is a SUBA\nto Po with respect to the numerical radius in BV (X, V ). In particular Po is the only\nminimal projection with respect to the numerical radius.\nRemark 3.6. In Theorem (3.4) the assumption that kAk < \u03bbA (X, V ) is essential.\n(3)\n\nIndeed, let X = l\u221e , V = {x \u2208 X : x1 + x2 = 0} and A = idV . Define\nP1 x = x \u2212 (x1 + x2 )(1, 0, 0)\nand\nP2 x = x \u2212 (x1 + x2 )(0, 1, 0).\nIt is clear that\nkP1 ko = kP1 kw = kP2 ko = kP2 kw = 1\nand P1 6= P2 . Hence there is no strongly unique minimal projection in this case.\nRemark 3.7. Theorem (2.3) cannot be generalized for real spaces X of dimension\nn \u2265 4.\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n, and let V = ker(f ), where f = (0, f2 , ..., fn ) \u2208 l1 satisfies\nIndeed let X = l\u221e P\nfi > 0 for i = 2, ..., n, n\ni=2 fi = 1 and fi < 1/2 for i = 1, ..., n. It is known (see [4],\n[37]) that in this case\n\u03bb(X, V ) = inf {kP k : P \u2208 P(X, V )} = 1 + (\n\nn\nX\n\nfi /(1 \u2212 2fi ))\u22121 > 1.\n\ni=2\nV\n\u03bbid\nw\n\nBy [1], \u03bb(X, V ) =\n(X, V ). Define for i = 2, ..., n yi = (\u03bb(X, V ) \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 2fi ). Let\ny = (y1 , ..., yn ) and z = (0, y2 , ..., yn ). Consider mappings P1 , P2 defined by\nP1 x = x \u2212 f (x)y\nand\nP2 x = x \u2212 f (x)z\n(n)\nl\u221e .\n\nIt is easy to see that Pi \u2208 P(X, V ), for i = 1, 2, P1 6= P2 . By ([37] p. 104)\nfor x \u2208\nV\nkPi ko = kPi kw = \u03bb(X, V ) = \u03bbid\nfor i = 1, 2.\nw\nRemark 3.8. Theorem (2.3) is not valid for complex three dimensional spaces.\n(3)\n\nLet X = l\u221e (in the complex case) and let\nV = {z \u2208 X : z1 + z2 + z3 = 0}.\nLet y = (1, 1, 1). We show that\nPz = z \u2212 (\n\nz1 + z2 + z3\n)y\n3\n\n10\n\n\fis a minimal projection in P(X, V ) with respect to the numerical radius and that\nkP kw = 4/3.\nLet f = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). It is easy to see that (compare with [37], p.103)\nkP k = max{|(P z)j )|, j = 1, 2, 3, kzk\u221e = 1}\n= max{|1 \u2212 fj yj | + yj (1 \u2212 fj ) : j = 1, 2, 3} = 4/3.\nNote that for j = 1, 2, 3\n(ej \u2297 xj )P = (P xj )j = 4/3,\nwhere x1 = (1, \u22121, \u22121), x2 = (\u22121, 1, \u22121) and x3 = (\u22121, \u22121, 1). Since ej (xj ) = 1 for\nj = 1, 2, 3, we have kP kw = 4/3. Also it is easy to see that\nWP = {(ej , xj ) : j = 1, 2, 3}.\nNotice that\n\n3\nX\n\n(ej \u2297 xj )|BV (X,V ) = 0\n\nj=1\n\nBy Theorem (2.2) and Remark (2.5), it follows that 0 is a best approximation to P\nin BV (X, V ) with respect to the numerical radius, which means that P is a minimal\nprojection with respect to the numerical radius.\nNow define z = i(1, 1, \u22122) and let L = f (*)z. It is clear that L \u2208 BV (X, V ). Note\nthat for j = 1, 2, 3\nre((ej \u2297 xj )L) = re(f (xj )zj ) = f (xj )re(zj ) = 0.\nBy Theorem (2.3), 0 is not a SUBA to P in BV (X, V ), which proves our claim.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. G.
