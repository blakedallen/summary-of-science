However, such scale dependence within the known terms of a series is widely\nregarded to be a reflection of the next-order uncertainty of that series. This folkloric assertion\nappears reasonable insofar as the series taken to all orders of perturbation theory must be\nindependent of the unphysical scale \u03bc. Indeed, the invariance of physical processes under\nchanges in \u03bc is the underlying justification for the renormalization-group equation.\nHowever, it is one thing to realize that \u03bc-dependence of a physical series disappears\nas the number of series terms increases, but quite another to say that the \u03bc-dependence\nexhibited at a given order of perturbation theory is indicative of truncation uncertainty\nassociated with our ignorance of the next-order term. In the present note, we demonstrate\nthat this stronger assertion is indeed correct within the context of MS QCD corrections\nto the inclusive electroproduction cross-section series R(s). Specifically, we demonstrate\nhow renormalization-group (RG) improvement of the terms within the known perturbative\nseries for this process replaces \u03bc-dependence with a new ambiguity contingent upon how\nthe perturbation-theory logarithm is defined, and that this ambiguity can be back-converted\ninto arbitrariness in any RG-optimal choice for the scale \u03bc. We are able to show, however,\nthat this new ambiguity does not enter the unimproved \u03bc2 = s perturbative series until the\n(RG-inaccessible) unknown next-order term, reflective of the truncation uncertainty of the\noriginal series.\nRadiative corrections to the inclusive electroproduction cross-section are scaled by a\nperturbative QCD series (S):\nR(s) \u2261\n\nX\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons)\n=\n3\nQ2f S.\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\nf\n\n(1)\n\nNeglecting quark masses, the perturbative series within Eq. (1) is of the form\nS =1+\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nxn (\u03bc)\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nm=0\n\nn=1\n\n2\n\nTn,m Lm ,\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere the nth power of the QCD couplant x(\u03bc) \u2261 \u03b1s (\u03bc)/\u03c0 is multiplied by a degree n \u2212 1\npolynomial in the logarithm L \u2261 log(\u03bc2 /s). The parameter \u03bc is the arbitrary renormalization scale that enters as a consequence of the perturbative renormalization procedure. The\ncoefficients Tn,0 have been calculated explicitly in the chiral limit from MS perturbation\ntheory out to n = 3 [1, 2],\n\n1\n\nnf = 3 :\n\nT1,0 = 1, T2,0 = 1.63982, T3,0 = \u221210.2839,\n\nnf = 4 :\n\nT1,0 = 1, T2,0 = 1.52453, T3,0 = \u221211.6856,\n\nnf = 5 :\n\nT1,0 = 1, T2,0 = 1.40924, T3,0 = \u221212.8046,\n\n(3)\n\nand for n \u2264 3, the coefficients Tn,m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2212 1) can easily be obtained from the\nprocess-appropriate RG equation [1, 4]:\nT2,1 = \u03b20 , T3,1 = 2\u03b20 T2,0 + \u03b21 ,\n\nT3,2 = \u03b202 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere [5]\n\u03b20 = (11 \u2212 2nf /3)/4, \u03b21 = (102 \u2212 38nf /3)/16,\n\u03b22 = (2857/2 \u2212 5033nf /18 + 325n2f /54)/64.\n\n(5)\n\nThe form of the series (2) is unaffected by a redefinition of the logarithm. If we redefine the\nlogarithm to be\nLk \u2261 log(k\u03bc2 /s) = L \u2212 log(k),\n\n(6)\n\nthe series (2) becomes\nS =1+\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\n\nx (\u03bc)\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nT\u0303n,m (Lk )m ,\n\n(7)\n\nm=0\n\nn=1\n\nwhere\nT\u03031,0 = T1,0 (= 1), T\u03032,0 = T2,0 \u2212 T2,1 log(k), T\u03032,1 = T2,1 ,\n1\n\nAlthough the form of (1) suggests that the singlet contributions proportional to x3\nbeen omitted, such singlet contributions have been absorbed into the values for T3,0 .\n\n3\n\n\u0010P\n\nf Qf\n\n\u00112\n\n[3] have\n\n\fT\u03033,0 = T3,0 \u2212 T3,1 log(k) + T3,2 log2 (k),\nT\u03033,1 = T3,1 \u2212 2T3,2 log(k), T\u03033,2 = T3,2 .\n\n(8)\n\nThus the redefinition (6) of the logarithm is compensated trivially by appropriate shifts in\nthe coefficients Tm,n , such that the series (2) and (7) agree order-by-order in the expansion\nparameter x(\u03bc). Note that incorporation of the redefined logarithm Lk (6) does not entail\nany compensating change in the renormalization scale \u03bc; the argument of x(\u03bc) has not been\naltered.\nIn refs. [6, 7], it is shown that truncations of the series (2) can be optimally RG-improved\nthrough inclusion of all terms in that series accessible via the RG-equation, an approach\nsuggested first (to our knowledge) by Maxwell [8]. Given the current determination of the\nMS QCD \u03b2-function to four orders in \u03b1s [9], one can show that knowledge of T1,0 is sufficient to determine all leading-logarithm coefficients Tn,n\u22121 ; knowledge of T2,0 is sufficient to\ndetermine all next-to-leading logarithm coefficients Tn,n\u22122 ; and knowledge of T3,0 is sufficient\nto determine all two-from-leading logarithm coefficients Tn,n\u22123 [6]. Thus one can obtain\nall-orders summations of sequentially-subleading logarithms within the series (2):\nS \u2192 S\u03a3 = 1 + x(\u03bc)\n+ x2 (\u03bc)\n+ x3 (\u03bc)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nTn,n\u22121 (x(\u03bc)L)n\u22121\n\nn=1\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=2\n\u221e\nX\n\nTn,n\u22122 (x(\u03bc)L)n\u22122\nTn,n\u22123 (x(\u03bc)L)n\u22123 + ...\n\nn=3\n\n= 1 + x(\u03bc)S1 (x(\u03bc)L) + x2 (\u03bc)S2 (x(\u03bc)L) + x3 (\u03bc)S3 (x(\u03bc)L) + ...\n(9)\nIn ref.

For example, if\nthe series (2) is truncated after its known O(x3 ) contributions, one finds for nf = 5 and\n\u221a\ns = 15 GeV that this truncated unimproved series (S (3) ) increases from 1.0525 to 1.0540\n\u221a\n\u221a\nas \u03bc varies from s/2 to 2 s, given 4-loop evolution of \u03b1s (\u03bc) from \u03b1s (Mz ) = 0.11800 [7].\n(3)\n\nBy contrast, a corresponding truncation S\u03a3 of the optimally RG-improved series (9) after\n(3)\n\nits x3 (\u03bc)S3 (x(\u03bc)L) term eliminates almost all such residual scale dependence; i.e., S\u03a3 stays\nbetween 1.0537 and 1.0538 over the same range of \u03bc [7]. Since Eqs. (2) and (9) are identical\nwhen L = 0, one can argue that such optimal RG-improvement favours the physical choice\n\u221a\n\u03bc = s for the renormalization scale occurring in the original series (2).\nHowever, this elimination of scale dependence appears to come at a price. Suppose one\nredefines the logarithm via Eq. (6) and then sums successively-subleading logarithms in the\nseries (7). One finds that this new summation-of-logarithms series differs from the series\n(9), even though the unimproved series (2) and (7) are order-by-order equivalent.

(8)] that T1,0 = T\u03031,0 = 1, one finds that corresponding truncations of the\nsummation-of-leading logarithms series are inequivalent because of their differing logarithms:\n(1)\n\n(17)\n\n(1)\n\n(18)\n\nS\u03a3 = 1 + x(\u03bc)/ (1 \u2212 \u03b20 x(\u03bc)L) ,\nS\u03a3\u2032 = 1 + x(\u03bc)/ (1 \u2212 \u03b20 x(\u03bc)Lk ) .\n\nIf both expressions are comparably free of residual \u03bc-dependence, we see that the \u03bc-dependence\nfrom the corresponding truncation of the unimproved series,\nS (1) = 1 + x(\u03bc),\n\n(19)\n\nappears to be replaced by the k-dependence in Eq. (18), a reflection of the arbitrariness in\nhow the logarithm is defined. Moreover, the (essentially \u03bc-independent) RG-improved series\n(13) coincides with the unimproved series (7) at Lk = 0, corresponding in this latter series\n6\n\n\fto a preferred value for \u03bc of \u03bc =\n\nq\n\ns/k, where k is arbitrary.\n\n2\n\nThus the ambiguity in\n\nthe renormalization-scale \u03bc chosen for the unimproved series is replaced by a corresponding\nambiguity in how the logarithms are to be defined in the improved series prior to their\nsummation.\nIn actual fact, such k-dependence can be subsumed entirely into the truncation uncer\u221a\ntainty of the Eq. (19) when \u03bc is chosen to be the external physical scale s. Thus, we argue\nthat the k-dependence of Eq. (18) is really a reflection of the error implicit in truncating the\nseries (2) after its first two terms (19). To see this, consider first the explicit \u03bc-dependence of\nthe one loop running couplant (\u03bc2 dx/d\u03bc2 = \u2212\u03b20 x2 ) about its RG-invariant reference value\n\u221a\nx( s):\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(20)\nx(\u03bc) = x( s)/ 1 + \u03b20 x( s) log(\u03bc2 /s) .\nIf we substitute Eq.

Moreover, its\n\u221a\ndependence upon log(k) [the logarithm ambiguity] occurs only in the next order of x( s),\ni.e., within a term not determined by the RG equation. Consequently, Eq. (21) is fully\n\u221a\nconsistent with the unimproved expression (19) when \u03bc = s, regardless of k.\nSurprisingly, we find that the transfer all k-dependence to the first post-truncation order\n(as well as the absence of any \u03bc-dependence in the first post-truncation order as well as in\nprevious orders) is upheld when the next two subsequent orders of perturbation theory are\ntaken into account.

(22), the O(x3 ) truncation of the unimproved\n\u221a\nseries (7) evaluated at \u03bc = s. The k-ambiguity ( i.e. the arbitrariness in how the logarithm\nis defined) is entirely absorbed in the not-yet-known next order of perturbation theory; indeed\n\u221a\nthis O (x4 ( s)) contribution is zero if k is chosen equal to one. Moreover, this contribution\ndoes not exhibit any renormalization scale dependence, which is not seen to arise until the\n\u221a\nO (x5 ( s)) contribution to Eq. (25). In other words, neither the k-ambiguity nor any \u03bcdependence occurs in terms that should be determined by the RG equation. The parameter\nk does not occur until the first RG-inaccessible order, and the parameter \u03bc does not occur\nuntil the second RG-inaccessible order.\nThus, if one implements RG-improvement on Eq. (22), which is just the series (7) truncated after calculationally known terms, by summing leading and two subsequently subleading sets of logarithms to all orders of perturbation theory, one finds that the arbitrariness\nin how the logarithm in the series (7) is defined does not enter the RG-improved expression\n\u221a\n(25) until the first post-truncation order of x( s), a term sensitive to the not-yet-known coefficient T4,0 . Consequently, the ambiguity in how the logarithm is defined can be absorbed\nin the truncation-uncertainty of the series. This uncertainty is decoupled from any residual\ndependence on the renormalization scale parameter \u03bc. The RG-improved expression (25) is\nseen to retain renormalization-scale independence even to this first post-truncation order.\nIn the truncation of a conventional perturbative series such as Eq. (2), minimization of\nthe residual scale dependence is known to be of value in extracting information about higher\norder terms. Such an approach has, for example, been employed in the extraction of \u03b1s\nfrom deep inelastic scattering structure functions [12]. Pertinent to our present analysis,\n9\n\n\fthe minimization of residual scale dependence has also proved useful in obtaining estimates\nof the (as-yet-uncalculated) series (2) coefficient T4,0 [13], estimates which appear to be\ncorroborated by the O(n2f ) contributions to the absorptive parts of the five-loop vectorcurrent vacuum polarization function [14] used to construct R(s). The values of log(k) that\nrespectively correspond to ref. [13]'s predicted values for T4,0 [-128 (nf = 3), -112 (nf = 4),\n-97 (nf = 5)] are log k = {\u22121.76, 1.41, 4.51} for nf = 3, log k = {\u22122.03, 1.26, 4.82} for\nnf = 4, and log k = {\u22122.38, 1.13, 5.10} for nf = 5.\nWithin Eq. (25), one might similarly speculate that minimization of the sensitivity of\n\u221a\nthe x4 ( s) coefficient to changes in k might also serve to predict T4,0 , or at least its approximate magnitude, consistent with Stevenson's Principle of Minimal Sensitivity [15]. If\n\u221a\none optimizes Eq. (25)'s x4 ( s) coefficient with respect to log(k), one obtains a quadratic\nequation whose solution yields two real optimization points. The larger of these points of\nminimal sensitivity to k yields values with the same sign and approximately double the\nmagnitude of ref. [13] predictions for T4,0 . However, values of log(k) for which A(k) = 0,\n\u221a\neliminating truncation uncertainty at O(x5 ) for \u03bc = s, respectively result in the predictions\nT4,0 = {\u2212117, \u2212126, \u2212133} for nf = {3, 4, 5}- values in reasonable agreement with the ref.\n[13] estimates. It is particularly of interest that such T4,0 estimates were obtained via the\nAdler function in the Euclidean momentum region [13], and that they nevertheless appear\nto be corroborated by the Minkowski region approach delineated above. Moreover, different\nchoices of renormalization scale do not have a significant effect on the values of log(k) that\neliminate the full O(x5 ) truncation uncertainty.\nTo summarize, residual renormalization-scale dependence of truncations of the perturbative series (7) [which is term-by-term equivalent to the original series (2)] no longer occurs\nwithin the optimally RG-improved series obtained through all-orders summation of leading\nand successively-subleading logarithms [7]. However, such RG-improved results now depend\non how the logarithm is defined, i.e., the parameter k in Eq. (6), even though truncations\n10\n\n\fof the unimproved series (7) are independent of this choice. Moreover, a clear correspondence (\u03bc =\n\nq\n\ns/k) exists between the \"k-ambiguity\" of the improved series and the scale\n\n\u03bc-dependence of the unimproved series. We have shown here that the ambiguity in how the\nlogarithm is defined is ultimately a reflection of the uncertainty deriving from truncation of\nthe series itself. Thus, residual renormalization-scale dependence is demonstrably a reflection\nof the uncertainty associated with the unknown next-order term.\nWe are grateful for research support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil of Canada (NSERC), and for discussions with A.
