We give conditions on the Lee vector field of an almost\nHermitian manifold such that any holomorphic map from this manifold\ninto a (1, 2)-symplectic manifold must satisfy the fourth-order condition of being biharmonic, hence generalizing the Lichnerowicz theorem\non harmonic maps. These third-order non-linear conditions are shown\nto greatly simplify on l.c.K. manifolds and construction methods and\nexamples are given in all dimensions.\n\n1. Introduction\nWhether seen as a generalization of closed geodesics or an infinite dimensional Morse theory, harmonic maps are one of the most important subjects\namong geometric variational problems. Their study has given rise to a whole\narray of questions from existence to regularity and stability and has been\nthe impetus to many new tools and techniques. The subtle balance of this\nproblem, born out of its dual nature, analytical and geometrical, has led to\nan existence theory marked by contrast between abundance results (the original Eells-Sampson theorem or maps between two-spheres), partial existence\n(e.g. from the two-torus to the two-sphere) and total lack, for example by\napplying the Bochner formula or sections with the Sasaki metric ([9, 10, 11]).\nWhen harmonic maps are absent or found wanting, one can seek mappings\nas close to harmonic as possible without actually being so, by devising a\nfunctional measuring the failure of harmonicity, i.e. the L2 -norm of the\ntension field, its vanishing characterizing harmonic maps. Critical points of\nthis bi-energy are called biharmonic maps and its associated Euler-Lagrange\nequation is a fourth-order system of elliptic PDE's. The high order of this\nequation as well as the explicit curvature term involved in it, make not\nonly existence results difficult to reach but even examples, or families of\nexamples, hard to come by. While some constructions exist, notably the\ncomposition of minimal immersions with the 45-th parallel map of spheres,\nin most instances biharmonic maps are few and far in between.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 32Q60, 58E20.\nKey words and phrases.

This\narticle was written while the third author was invited professor at the University of Brest.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. BENYOUNES, E. LOUBEAU AND R. SLOBODEANU\n\nOne redeeming feature is that, as a variational problem, all the techniques\nand tools employed to investigate harmonic maps can be tried on biharmonic\nmaps, in particular, and this in spite of the more analytical than geometrical\nessence of biharmonicity, constructions guided by geometric insight to reduce\nthe complexity of the problem. The first and foremost of such techniques is\nto work with equivariant maps and lower the number of variables, yielding\na fourth-order ODE, which carries its own difficulties (cf. [18]).\nAn alternative objective would be to decrease the order of the (system\nof) equations, combining an auxiliary equation with a geometric condition,\ne.g. turning harmonic maps into biharmonic ones by conformal transformations ([3]). In the context of Hermitian geometry, a readily available class\nof mappings is the holomorphic ones and the blue-print for this work is the\narticle of Lichnerowicz ([15]) giving conditions on almost complex structures\n(a cosymplectic domain and (1, 2)-symplectic target) ensuring that holomorphic maps are harmonic, hence uncoupling the second-order tension field into\ntwo first-order equations. For the fourth-order equation defining biharmonic\nmaps, there does not appear to be any corresponding (metric-independent)\nsecond-order condition which would enable an even splitting of the order of\nderivation between maps and complex structures.\nThe purpose of this article is to follow Lichnerowicz's original approach\nand show that it is indeed possible to determine conditions (necessarily\nweaker than in [15]) such that holomorphic maps satisfy the harder condition of biharmonicity, and produce examples. These conditions are perforce\nof third order and non-linear, and difficult to solve to the extent of being\nseemingly unproductive. Surprisingly, when working with the class of locally conformal K\u00e4hler (l.c.K.) manifolds, they become more amenable to\ngeometric interpretation to the point of allowing the construction of some\nexamples.\nIn the Gray-Hervella classification ([13]) of almost Hermitian manifolds,\n(1,2)-symplectic manifolds correspond to the class W1 \u2295 W2 , while the\ncosymplectic ones form W1 \u2295 W2 \u2295 W3 . If we assume the codomain to\nbe (1,2)-symplectic, in order to avoid recovering Lichnerowicz's result, the\nmost reasonable class to consider for the domain is W4 which contains l.c.K.\nmanifolds. These manifolds are defined by the existence of an open cover\nsuch that locally the metric is conformal to a K\u00e4hler metric and, crucially\nto us, this translates into the existence of a global closed vector field B,\nthe Lee vector field, proportional to the divergence of the almost complex\nstructure, whose dual one-form \u03b8 satisfies the integrability condition of the\nfundamental two-form \u03a9: d\u03a9 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03a9.\nLocally conformal K\u00e4hler manifolds have been extensively studied since\nVaisman's pioneering paper [28] and the monograph [21] and surveys [20, 23]\ngive an excellent account of the latest developments.\nOn the one hand, some manifolds not supporting any K\u00e4hler structure,\nturn out to admit l.c.K. metrics. Compact examples include diagonal Hopf\nmanifolds ([12]), Inoue surfaces ([27]) and the complex surfaces classified\n\n\fBIHARMONIC HOLOMORPHIC MAPS\n\n3\n\nby Belgun ([5]), Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds ([19]) and generalized Thurston\nmanifolds, while non-compact examples are rarer, e.g. [26]. On the other\nhand, on manifolds known to admit a K\u00e4hler structure one can take representatives in the conformal class of the original metric turning them into\n(non-K\u00e4hler) globally conformal K\u00e4hler (g.c.K) manifolds, or prescribe new\n(non-g.c.K.) l.c.K. metrics as in [28]. By the local nature of our equations,\nany example can serve as testing ground for the biharmonicity conditions\nof Theorem 1 and the wealth of l.c.K. geometry allows enough freedom to\nconstruct non-trivial examples on which holomorphic maps are automatically biharmonic. Note that neither of the two conditions of Theorem 1\nis automatically satisfied on l.c.K. manifolds and the final section should\nhelp establishing general conditions on almost Hermitian manifolds making\nholomorphic maps biharmonic.\nThroughout the paper, manifolds, metrics, and maps are assumed to be\nsmooth, and (M, g) is a connected Riemannian manifold. We denote by \u2207\nthe Levi-Civita connection of (M, g), and we use the following sign conventions for the curvature tensor field\nR(X, Y )Z = \u2207X \u2207Y Z \u2212 \u2207Y \u2207X Z \u2212 \u2207[X,Y ] Z,\nand \u2206f = trace \u2207df for the Laplacian on functions.\nIf (M, J) is an almost complex manifold, we denote its real and complex\ndimensions by dimR M = m and dimC M = n, so m = 2n. The splitting of\nthe complexified tangent bundle in \u00b1i-eigenspaces is T C M = T \u2032 M \u2295 T \u2032\u2032 M ,\nand an adapted orthonormal frame of the form {Zj = \u221a12 (ej \u2212 iJej ), Z\uf6be\u0304 =\nZ j }j=1,2,...,n will be called a Hermitian frame. Summation on repeated indices is also assumed.\n2. Biharmonic maps\nLet \u03c6 : (M, g) \u2192 (N, h) be a smooth map between Riemannian manifolds\nand let \u2207\u03c6 denote the usual connection on the pull-back bundle, \u03c6\u22121 T N .\nThe rough Laplacian and Ricci operator on a section v of \u03c6\u22121 T N are\ntrace(\u2207\u03c6 )2 v =\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\nRic\u03c6 v =\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u2207\u03c6\ne i \u2207e i v \u2212 \u2207\u2207M e v\nei i\n\nRN (v, d\u03c6(ei ))d\u03c6(ei ),\n\ni=1\n\nwhere {ei }i=1,...,m is any local orthonormal frame on M .\nRecall that the tension field of \u03c6 is defined as \u03c4 (\u03c6) = trace \u2207d\u03c6, where\n\u2207d\u03c6 is the second fundamental form of \u03c6. Then the bienergy of the map \u03c6\nis ([9])\nZ\n1\nE2 (\u03c6) =\n|\u03c4 (\u03c6)|2 \u03bdg ,\n2 M\n\n\f4\n\nM. BENYOUNES, E. LOUBEAU AND R. SLOBODEANU\n\nand \u03c6 is biharmonic if it is a critical point of E2 , equivalently, if it satisfies\nthe associated Euler-Lagrange equation, i.e. the vanishing of the bitension\nfield, ([14])\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(1)\n\u03c42 (\u03c6) = trace(\u2207\u03c6 )2 + Ric\u03c6 \u03c4 (\u03c6) = 0.\n\nClearly harmonic maps are biharmonic but, if M is compact and N has\nnon-positive sectional curvature, any biharmonic map is harmonic ([14]).\nFor isometric immersions, compactness cannot be dropped ([24]), nevertheless biharmonic surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean or hyperbolic\nspace forms must be minimal ([8, 14]) and in higher dimensions, biharmonic\nproperly immersed submanifolds in Ek are minimal ([1]).\nContrastingly for positively curved codomains constructions are known,\ne.g. biharmonic curves in Sn are explicitly known ([8]), and the composition\n\u221a\nof a minimal immersion with the 45-th parallel immersion \u221a\nof Sn\u22121 (1/ 2) in\nSn is biharmonic but not harmonic ([8]). Moreover, S2 (1/ 2) is essentially\nthe only nonharmonic biharmonic surface of S3 ([7]), while, in S4 there exist\nclosed orientable embedded nonminimal biharmonic surfaces of arbitrary\ngenus ([8]). In the non-orientable case, a nonminimal biharmonic embedding\nof RP 2 in S5 is explicitly given in [8].\nExamples of (conformal) biharmonic maps between equidimensional manifolds are also known in dimension 3 and 4 ([2, 3]), e.g. the inverse map of\nthe stereographic projection of S4 or the inversion on R4 \\ {0}.\nSubmersive biharmonic maps have also been constructed from the Hopf\nmap, after composition with an inversion or stereographic projection ([2]). A\nmore general scheme ([3, 25]) is to start with some harmonic map and render\nit biharmonic by conformal transformations of the (co)domain metric; this\nyields the construction of examples from R4 to R \u00d7 S2, from R3 to R2 or the\nidentity map of Rm\n+ . However the picture is more rigid in low dimensions,\nas a biharmonic Riemannian submersion from a 3-dimensional space form\ninto a surface is necessarily harmonic ([30]).\nThis quick review of the construction of (nonharmonic) biharmonic maps\nshows how sporadic the available examples are and highlights the need for\na more systematic approach. Since most of the techniques developed for\nharmonic maps apply to biharmonic maps, though usually harder to implement, in the next section we will follow Lichnerowicz' method to obtain\nconditions such that holomorphic maps become biharmonic.\n3. Biharmonic holomorphic maps\nThis section establishes conditions on the domain forcing holomorphic\nmaps into a (1, 2)-symplectic target, to be biharmonic. The key observation\nis that for such mappings the tension field is nothing but the image of the\n(scaled) Lee vector field and thus the computation of the bitension field\nonly requires a formula on the commutation of the differential of the map\nand second order covariant derivatives. This then easily leads, in Theorem\n1, to the identification of a pair of sufficient conditions on the Lee vector\n\n\fBIHARMONIC HOLOMORPHIC MAPS\n\n5\n\nfield. Though these equations are automatically satisfied by cosymplectic\nstructures, in general they are unwieldy and, in the following section, we\nwill have to consider a quite particular class of complex manifolds before\nbeing able to construct solutions. Since all of the computations are carried\nout on the complexification of the tangent bundle, the resulting conditions\ncan be re-written (Corollary 1) on the real tangent bundle, as required by\nthe nature of our problem.\nProposition 1.

Biharmonic holomorphic maps on l.c.K. manifolds\nIn this paragraph, we exploit the conditions of Theorem 1 on locally\nconformally K\u00e4hler manifolds. This class of complex manifolds provides a\nquite suitable framework for our problem on at least two accounts: first\nby mere definition their Lee vector fields do not vanish and therefore we\nsteer clear of the Lichnerowicz theorem and harmonic maps; second the\ncumbersome equations of Theorem 1 greatly simplify to take on a strong\ngeometric flavour (Proposition 2).\nThis adequacy is even more palpable in Proposition 3, when the equations\nare localized on conformally K\u00e4hler open subsets and transformed in terms\nof the conformal factor. Note that, as one should expect, we encounter one\nthe equations of [3], since the identity map will always be holomorphic.\nWhile biharmonicity in dimension four does not enjoy the conformal invariance of harmonic maps on surfaces, it has often been observed to possess\nsome distinct features, as illustrated by biharmonic morphisms or the stressenergy tensor. This phenomenon occurs again here in Proposition 4, where\nour equations in dimension four reformulate into purely geometric conditions\non the scalar and Ricci curvatures.\nDefinition 1. ([21]) A Hermitian manifold (M, g, J) is called locally conformal K\u00e4hler (l.c.K.) if each point admits a neighbourhood on which the\nmetric is conformal to a K\u00e4hler metric. This is equivalent to the existence\nof a (globally defined) closed one-form \u03b8, the Lee form, such that\nd\u03a9 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03a9,\nwhere \u03a9(X, Y ) = g(X, JY ) is the K\u00e4hler form. If \u03b8 is moreover exact, the\nmanifold is called globally conformal K\u00e4hler (g.c.K.).\nIf dimR M > 2, then for all vectors X and Y\n(7)\n\n(\u2207X J)(Y ) =\n\n1\n2\n\n(\u03b8(JY )X \u2212 \u03b8(Y )JX + g(X, Y )JB \u2212 \u03a9(X, Y )B) ,\n\nwhere the Lee vector field B =\n\n2\n2\u2212dim M J\n\ndiv J is the dual of \u03b8.\n\n\f8\n\nM.

This, in turn, is equivalent to Hess(e\u03b3 ) being\nJ-invariant, which is the local version of Condition (16) .\nFinally, the formula ([29]) s \u2212 s\u2217 = 2\u03b4\u03b8 + |\u03b8|2 shows Condition (17) to be\nequivalent to the equality of s and s\u2217 .\n\u0003\n5. Constructions and examples\nThe main advantage of Proposition 3 is that it is tailor-made for the construction of examples (necessarily non-compact by (12)). We first use it to\ngive a recipe producing solutions to our problem from a one-dimensional foliation on a K\u00e4hler manifold, provided its tangent vector field is holomorphic\nand exact and under a condition on the eigenvalues of the pullback metric\nfrom the leaf space. Though this requirement may seem rather strong at\nfirst, it actually turns out to give a unified approach to all three examples\nwe present. While the first one shows that solutions can even be obtained\non complex Euclidean spaces, Example 2 works for (the K\u00e4hler cone of) any\nSasakian manifold, but in both cases a restriction on the dimension limits\nthe solutions to complex surfaces. However, in Example 3, an Inoue-type\nconstruction on the product of any K\u00e4hler manifold and the upper half space\nis shown to yield examples in all dimensions.\nProposition 5. Let (M m , g, J) be a K\u00e4hler manifold and \u03c6 : M \u2192 (N m\u22121 , h)\na submersion with one-dimensional fibres spanned by a vector field V =\n\n\fBIHARMONIC HOLOMORPHIC MAPS\n\n11\n\ngrad F , where F is a positive smooth function on M . If V is a holomorphic\nvector field and the eigenvalues of \u03c6\u2217 h with respect to g satisfy\nm\u22121\nY\ni=1\n5\nY\ni=1\n\n4\n\n\u03bbi = F m\u22126 | grad F |,\n\u03bbi = 2F | grad F |,\n\nwhen m 6= 6;\n\nwhen m = 6,\n\n2\nln F (respectively \u03b3 = F ), when m 6= 6 (respectively m = 6)\nthen \u03b3 = m\u22126\nsatisfies the hypothesis of Proposition 3.\n\nLemma 1. Let \u03c6 : (M m , g) \u2192 (N m\u22121 , h) be a submersion and V a vertical\nvector field. Then\nQm\u22121 !\n\u03bbi\n= 0,\n(18)\ndiv V + V ln i=1\n|V |\nwhere \u03bb2i are the eigenvalues of \u03c6\u2217 h with respect to g.\nProof. Let \u03c6 : (M m , g) \u2192 (N m\u22121 , h) be a submersion and {Ei , U }i=1,...,m\u22121\nan orthonormal frame of eigenvectors of \u03c6\u2217 h, i.e. d\u03c6(U ) = 0 and \u03c6\u2217 h(Ei , X) =\n\u03bb2i g(Ei , X) for any vector X. Since, for any i, we have ([17])\nU (ln \u03bbi ) = g(\u2207Ei Ei , U ),\nthen\ndiv U + U\n\nln\n\nm\u22121\nY\ni=1\n\nand Equation (18) follows.\n\n\u03bbi\n\n!\n\n= 0,\n\u0003\n\nProof of Proposition 5. Let (M m , g, J) be a K\u00e4hler manifold, if V is gradient\nvector field on M , V = grad F , then JV is is a Killing vector field if and\nonly if V is (real) holomorphic. Then Equation (12) from Proposition 3\ntranslates into\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4\n(19)\ndiv V + V ln F m\u22126 = 0,\nfor m 6= 6, where F = e\n\n(20)\n\nm\u22126\n\u03b3\n2\n\n, and\n\ndiv V + V (2F ) = 0,\n\nfor m = 6, where F = \u03b3. Conclude by combining with Equation (18).\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 1. Let \u03b3 be a function on the complex Euclidean space (Cn , can).\nIn standard real coordinates, a Killing vector field has the general form\n\u03be(x1 , ..., x2n ) = (\u2212\u03b11 x2 , \u03b11 x1 , \u2212\u03b12 x4 , \u03b12 x3 , ...),\n\n\f12\n\nM. BENYOUNES, E. LOUBEAU AND R. SLOBODEANU\n\nwhere {\u03b1k }k=1,...,n are real constants. Therefore J(e(n\u22123)\u03b3 grad \u03b3) is a Killing\nvector field if and only if\n!\nn\nX\n\u03b1\nk\n1\nln\n+ x22k ) , when n 6= 3,\n(x2\n\u03b3(x) = n\u22123\n2 2k\u22121\nk=1\n\n\u03b3(x) =\n\n3\nX\nk=1\n\n\u03b1k 2\n(x\n+ x22k ),\n2 2k\u22121\n\nwhen n = 3.\n\nThis function is a solution of Equation (12) if and only if n = 2 and \u03b11 = \u03b12 ,\nand by Proposition 3, any holomorphic map from (C2 \\ {0}, |z|\u22124 can) into\na (1, 2)-symplectic almost Hermitian manifold will be biharmonic.\nThe following example can be seen as a generalization of Example 1 as\n(C2 \\ {0}, can) is isometric to the cone over the 3-sphere.\nExample 2. Let (C(S), J, gb) be the K\u00e4hler cone over a Sasakian manifold\n(S 2n\u22121 , \u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, g), that is C(S) = R\u2217+ \u00d7 S endowed with the almost complex\nstructure\nJ (X, f \u2202r ) = (\u03c6X \u2212 f \u03be, \u03b7(X)\u2202r ).\nand the warped product metric gb = dr 2 + r 2 g.\nLet \u03b3 = \u03b3(r) be a smooth real function on C(S). In this case, Equation\n(12) becomes\n\u03b3\u2032\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 + (2n \u2212 1) + (n \u2212 1)(\u03b3 \u2032 )2 = 0\nr\nwith the solution \u03b3 = \u2212 ln r 2 . For this function J(e(n\u22123)\u03b3 grad \u03b3) is a Killing\nvector field if and only if grad r 6\u22122n is holomorphic which is the case only\nwhen n = 2. Therefore, if S is a Sasakian 3-dimensional manifold, then,\nby Proposition 3, any holomorphic map from the (C(S), r \u22124 b\ng ) into a (1, 2)symplectic almost Hermitian manifold must be biharmonic.\nExample 3. Let H = {w = w1 + iw2 \u2208 C|w2 > 0} be the upper half plane\nand (K, k, J K ) be a K\u00e4hler manifold of complex dimension n \u2212 1. Consider\nthe product H \u00d7 K endowed with the K\u00e4hler metric\ng = f 2 (w2 )dw \u2297 dw + k,\n\nwhere f : (0, \u221e) \u2192 R is a smooth function. Let \u03b3 = \u03b3(w2 ) be a smooth real\nfunction on H \u00d7 K. For n 6= 3, the conditions of Proposition 3 become\nf F \u2032\u2032 \u2212 2f \u2032 F \u2032 = 0,\n\nand\n\n(n \u2212 3)F F \u2032\u2032 + 2(F \u2032 )2 = 0,\nwhere F = e(n\u22123)\u03b3 . For n = 3, the same conditions are, respectively\nwith the solution\n\nf \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 2f \u2032 \u03b3 \u2032 = 0\n\u03b3=\n\n1\nn\u22121\n\nln w2 ,\n\nand\n\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 + 2(\u03b3 \u2032 )2 = 0,\n1\n\u2212 n\u22121\n\nf (w2 ) = w2\n\n,\n\n\fBIHARMONIC HOLOMORPHIC MAPS\n\n13\n\nfor any n.\nThis actually produces examples in all dimensions, since any holomorphic\n2\n\nmap from the warped product (H \u00d7 K n\u22121 , g = dw \u2297 dw + w2n\u22121 k) into a\n(1, 2)-symplectic almost Hermitian manifold will be biharmonic.\nRemark 2. Examples 1 and 2 can be recovered from Proposition 5 with the\nradial projection\n(R\u2217+ \u00d7 S, gb) \u2192 (S, g)\n\nand Example 3 with the projection along the second component\nH \u00d7 K \u2192 R \u00d7 K,\n\n(w1 , w2 , x) 7\u2192 (w1 , x).\n\nwhere H \u00d7 K is endowed with the (K\u00e4hler) metric\n4/(2\u2212m)\n\ng = w2\n\n(dw12 + dw22 ) + k\n\nand R \u00d7 K with the product metric h = dw12 + k.\nIn all these cases the horizontal distribution is integrable.\nRemark 3. Let (M, g, J) be a K\u00e4hler manifold and \u03b3 a smooth function on\nM such that Id : (M, e2\u03b3 g) \u2192 (M, g) is a biharmonic morphism ([16]). Then\nany holomorphic map from (M, e2\u03b3 g, J) into a (1, 2)-symplectic manifold is\nbiharmonic.\nThis alternative construction of biharmonic holomorphic maps can only\noverlap with this paper for dim M = 4. This is the case of Example 1\n(which up to an isometry was given in [16]), but not of Example 3 since\nId : (H \u00d7 C, e2\u03b3 g) \u2192 (H \u00d7 C, g) is not a biharmonic morphism.\nReferences\n[1] K.
