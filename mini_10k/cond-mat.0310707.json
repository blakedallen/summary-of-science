The sequence makes the protein\nunique and assigns it a specific function within a biological organism. The reason is that the different types\nof amino acids vary in their response to the environment\nand in their mutual interaction. It is a challenging task to\nreveal on what general principles the folding process of a\nprotein is based. Models differ extremely in their level of\nabstraction, ranging from simple and purely qualitative\nlattice models to highly sophisticated all-atom off-lattice\nformulations with explicit solvent that partially yield results comparable with experimental data. Due to the\nenormous computational effort required for simulations\nof realistic proteins, usually characteristic properties of a\nprotein with a given sequence are studied in detail. Much\nsimpler, but by no means trivial, lattice models enjoy a\ngrowing interest, since they allow a more global view on,\nfor example, the analysis of the relation between sequence\nand structure.\nIn this paper, we shall focus ourselves on thermodynamic properties of lattice proteins at all temperatures.\nIn particular, this includes the investigation of the transitions between the different classes of states: lowestenergy states, compact globules, and random coils. Since\nthe ground-state\u2013globule transition occurs at rather low\ntemperatures, a powerful algorithm is required that in\nparticular allows a reasonable sampling of the low-lying\nenergy states. To this end we combined multicanonical\nstrategies [1\u20133] with chain growth algorithms [4\u20137] to a\nnew method [8] which works temperature-independent\nand directly simulates the density of states. This quantity contains all energetic information necessary for computing the mean energy, free energy, entropy, and specific\nheat for all temperatures. In the following, we present re-\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\nmichael.bachmann@itp.uni-leipzig.de\nwolfhard.janke@itp.uni-leipzig.de;\nHomepage: http://www.physik.uni-leipzig.de/CQT\n\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\nsults obtained from the application of this method to different lattice proteins with lengths up to 103 monomers,\nmodelled by the simplest lattice formulation for heteropolymers, the HP model [9]. In this model, only two\ntypes of monomers enter, hydrophobic (H) and polar (P)\nresidues. The model is based on the assumption that\nthe hydrophobic interaction is one of the fundamental\nprinciples in protein folding. An attractive hydrophobic interaction provides for the formation of a compact\nhydrophobic core that is screened from the aqueous environment by a shell of polar residues. Therefore the\nenergy function reads\nE=\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03c3i \u03c3j ,\n\n(1)\n\nhi,j<i\u22121i\n\nwhere hi, j < i \u2212 1i denotes summation over nearest\nlattice neighbours that are nonadjacent along the selfavoiding chain of monomers. A hydrophobic monomer\nat the ith position in the chain has \u03c3i = 1 and a polar\nmonomer is assigned \u03c3i = 0.\nThe first part of this paper, where we explain how our\nnew method works, will be of a more technical nature,\nwhile the second part is devoted to applications of this\nalgorithm to heteropolymers. In Section II we discuss\nthe main differences of Monte Carlo methods based on\nmove sets for updating conformations and chain growth\nalgorithms as well as their peculiarities. This is followed by Section III about the thermodynamic quantities that will be estimated with our method. Then, in\nSection IV, we enter into the description of the multicanonical chain growth algorithm. This technical part is\npreluded by recalling the essential ingredients of PERM\nand nPERMss\nis [4\u20137] as these are fundamental for setting\nup our algorithm. Then we proceed with the explanation\nof multicanonical chain growth and the determination of\nthe multicanonical weight factors. Section V is devoted\nto the validation of our method, and in Section VI we\npresent the results obtained with our algorithm. There\nwe focus on thermodynamic properties of heteropolymers\nwith sequences of more than 40 monomers. Finally, we\nsummarise the main aspects of this paper in Section VII.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMOVE SETS VS. CHAIN GROWTH\n\nPolymers fold on a lattice into conformations that are\nby definition self-avoiding. This takes into account the\nfinite volume and the uniqueness of the monomers. A\nlattice site can hence be occupied by a single monomer\nonly. This has the consequence that the number of very\ndense conformations of a polymer is by orders of magnitude lower than that of random coil states. In Monte\nCarlo simulations, particular attention must therefore be\ndevoted to efficient update procedures which also allow\nthe sampling of dense conformations. In polymer simulations, so-called move sets were applied with some success to study the behaviour near the \u0398 point, which denotes the phase transition, where polymers subject to\nan attractive interaction collapse from random coils to\ncompact conformations. Move sets being widely used\nusually consist of transformations that change the position of a single monomer and a single bond vector (end\nflips), a single monomer position but two bonds (corner flips), two positions and three bonds (crankshaft)\nor moves with more changes, and pivot rotations, where\nthe ith monomer serves as pivot point and one of the\ntwo partial chains connected with it is rotated about any\naxis through the pivot [10]. For (a-thermal) self-avoiding\nwalks the latter method is known to be very efficient [11].\nIt becomes inefficient, however, the more dense the conformation is. At low temperatures, the acceptance rate\nof locally changing a dense conformation decreases drastically and the simulation threatens to get stuck in a\nspecific conformation or to oscillate between two states.\nSince the search for ground states is an essential aspect\nof studying lattice proteins, the application of move sets\nis not very useful, at least for chains of reasonable length.\nA more promising alternative is the completely different approach based on chain growth. The polymer\ngrows by attaching the nth monomer at a randomly chosen next-neighbour site of the (n \u2212 1)th monomer. The\ngrowth is stopped, if the total length N of the chain\nis reached or the randomly selected continuation of the\nchain is already occupied. In both cases, the next chain\nis started to grow from the first monomer. This simple chain growth is also not yet very efficient, since the\nnumber of discarded chains grows exponentially with the\nchain length. The performance can be improved with the\nRosenbluth chain growth method [12], where first the free\nnext neighbours of the (n\u22121)th monomer are determined\nand then the new monomer is placed to one of the unoccupied sites. Since the probability of each possibility\nfor the next monomer to be set varies with the number\nof free neighbours, this implies a bias given by\n!\u22121\nn\nY\npn \u223c\n,\n(2)\nml\nl=2\n\nwhere ml is the number of free neighbours to place the\nlth monomer. The bias is corrected by assigning a Rosenbluth weight factor WnR \u223c p\u22121\nn to each chain that has\n\nbeen generated by this procedure. Nevertheless, this\nmethod suffers from attrition too: If all next neighbours\nare occupied, i.e., the chain was running into a \"dead\nend\" (attrition point), the complete chain has to be discarded and the growth process has to be started anew.\nCombining the Rosenbluth chain growth method with\npopulation control, however, as is done in PERM\n(Pruned-Enriched Rosenbluth Method) [4, 5], leads to\na further considerable improvement of the efficiency by\nincreasing the number of successfully generated chains.\nThis method renders particularly useful for studying the\n\u0398 point of polymers, since then the Rosenbluth weights\nof the statistically relevant chains approximately cancel\nagainst their Boltzmann probability. The (a-thermal)\nRosenbluth weight factor WnR is therefore replaced by\nWnPERM =\n\nn\nY\n\nml e\u2212(El \u2212El\u22121 )/kB T ,\n\n(3)\n\nl=2\n\n2\u2264n\u2264N\n\n(E1 = 0,\n\nW1PERM = 1),\n\nwhere T is the temperature and El is the energy of the\npartial chain Xl = (x1 , . . . , xl ) created with Rosenbluth\nchain growth. In PERM, population control works as follows. If a chain has reached length n, its weight WnPERM\nis calculated and compared with suitably chosen upper\nand lower threshold values, Wn> and Wn< , respectively.\nFor WnPERM > Wn> , identical copies are created which\ngrow then independently. The weight is equally divided\namong them. If WnPERM < Wn< , the chain is pruned\nwith some probability, say 1/2, and in case of survival,\nits weight is doubled. For a value of the weight lying\nbetween the thresholds, the chain is simply continued\nwithout enriching or pruning the sample.\nIn the recently developed new variants nPERMss\nis [6],\nthe number of copies is not constant and depends on\nthe ratio of the weight WnPERM compared to the upper\nthreshold value Wn> and the copies are necessarily chosen to be different (the method of selecting the copies is\nbased on simple sampling (ss) in nPERMss and a kind\nof importance sampling (is) in nPERMis). This proves\nquite useful in producing highly compact polymers and\ntherefore these new methods are very powerful in determining lowest-energy states of lattice proteins.\n\nIII. DENSITY OF STATES AND\nTHERMODYNAMIC QUANTITIES\n\nIn order to investigate the thermodynamic properties\nof lattice proteins accurate simulations are necessary.\nDue to the difficulties with the update of conformations\nat low temperatures and a primary interest in detecting\nlowest-energy conformations, only a few results of thermodynamic quantities are found in the literature. Nevertheless, the understanding of the conformational transitions and the dependence of their sharpness on the sequence is only possible with algorithms that yield good\n\n\f3\nresults for low as well as for high temperatures. Consequently, reasonable results can only be obtained, if the\nmethod allows the sampling of the entire energy space.\nAll energetic statistical quantities of the protein can\nbe expressed by means of the density of energetic states\ng(E), since the partition function of a lattice protein with\ngiven sequence can be written as\nX\nX\n(4)\ng(Ei )e\u2212\u03b2Ei ,\ne\u2212\u03b2E({x}) =\nZ=\ni\n\n{x}\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T is the inverse of the thermal energy in natural units. The sum in the first representation runs over\nall possible realisations of self-avoiding walks on the lattice, while in the second expression the sum is taken over\nall energetic states a lattice protein can adopt. Then,\nthe expectation value of any energetic observable O(E)\nis simply\n1 X\nO(Ei )g(Ei )e\u2212\u03b2Ei ,\nZ i\n\nhO(E)i (T ) =\n\n(5)\n\nand the mean energy as the negative logarithmic derivative of Z with respect to \u03b2 is given by\n1 X\nEi g(Ei )e\u2212\u03b2Ei .\nZ i\n\nhEi (T ) =\n\n(6)\n\nWith these expressions, the specific heat CV = dhEi/dT\nobeys the fluctuation formula\nCV (T ) =\n\n\u0001\n1\nhE 2 i \u2212 hEi2 .\n2\nT\n\n(7)\n\nMoreover, knowing g(E), the Helmholtz free energy is\nobtained from\nX\ng(Ei ) exp{\u2212\u03b2Ei }\n(8)\nF (T ) = \u2212T ln\ni\n\nand the entropy can be calculated as\nS(T ) =\n\n1\n[hEi(T ) \u2212 F (T )] .\nT\n\n(9)\n\nIn addition, non-energetic structural quantities are of\ninterest for discussing the compactness of conformations,\nsuch as the end-to-end distance\nRee = |xN \u2212 x1 |\nand the radius of gyration\nv\nu\nN\nu1 X\n(xl \u2212 x0 )2 ,\nRgyr = t\nN\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nl=1\n\nPN\nwhere x0 = l=1 xl /N is the centre of mass of the conformation (with all monomers having equal mass). For\n\nthe calculation of mean values of non-energetic quantities\nO, Eq. (5) is replaced by the general formula\nhOi (T ) =\n\n1 X\nO({x})e\u2212\u03b2E({x}) .\nZ\n\n(12)\n\n{x}\n\nIn the following, we shall focus ourselves on the study\nof these thermodynamic quantities for different HP lattice proteins and develop an algorithm that allows a direct simulation of the density of states.\n\nIV.\n\nMULTICANONICAL CHAIN GROWTH\nALGORITHM\n\nBefore we describe the idea behind the multicanonical chain growth algorithm and the iterative determination of the multicanonical weights which are related to\nthe density of states, we first recall the canonical chain\ngrowth variants nPERMss\nis , on which our algorithm builds\nup.\n\nA.\n\nCanonical Chain Growth\n\nIn the original chain growth algorithm PERM [4], the\nsample of chains with length n < N is enriched by identical copies if the weight factor (3) is bigger than a threshold value Wn> . In order to obey correct Boltzmann statistics, the weight is divided among the clones. If, however,\nWnPERM < Wn< , the chain is pruned with, e.g. probability\n1/2, requiring the weight of a surviving chain to be taken\ntwice. Then one attaches a new monomer at a randomly\nchosen free next-neighbour site of the previous one. This\nis done for all chains that still exist and the procedure is\nrepeated until the total chain length N is reached or the\ngrowth of a chain was terminated by a dead end or due\nto pruning. After all chains created within this tree have\ngrown until their end is reached and thus the present socalled tour is finished, a new growth process starts from\nthe first monomer, i.e., a new tour begins. Having created an appropriate number of chains with length n, they\nwill be canonically distributed at the given temperature\nT . In fact, this is also true for all partial chains with\nintermediate lengths n < N , but there are strong correlations between chains with different lengths n.\nIn the recently proposed new PERM variants\nnPERMss\nis (new PERM with simple/importance sampling\n(ss/is)) a considerable improvement is achieved by creating different copies, i.e., the chains are identical in (n\u22121)\nmonomers but have different continuations, instead of\ncompletely identical ones, since identical partial chains\nusually show up a similar evolution. Because of the different continuations, the weights of the copies can differ.\nTherefore it is not possible to decide about the number\nof copies on the basis of a joint weight. The suggestion\nis to calculate first a predicted weight which is then compared with the upper threshold Wn> in order to determine\n\n\f4\nthe number of clones. Another improvement of PERM\nbeing followed up since first applications to lattice proteins is that the threshold values Wn> and Wn< are no\nlonger constants, but are dynamically adapted with regard to the present estimate for the partition sum and\nto the number of successfully created chains with length\nn. The partition sum is proportional to the sum over the\nweight factors of all conformations of chains with length\nn, created with a Rosenbluth chain growth method like,\nfor instance, nPERMss\nis :\nZn =\n\n1\nMtours\n\nX\n\nnPERMss\nis\n\nWn\n\n(Xn,t ).\n\n(13)\n\nt\n\nHere, Xn,t denotes the tth generated conformation of\nlength n. The proportionality constant is the inverse\nof the number of successful tours, i.e., the number of\nchain growth starts Mtours that led to the generation of\nat least one chain of length n. Note that due to this\nnormalisation it is possible to estimate the degeneracy of\nthe energy states. This is in striking contrast to importance sampling Monte Carlo methods, where the overall\nconstant on the r.h.s. of Eq. (13) cannot be determined\nand hence only relative degeneracies can be estimated.\nSince nPERMss and nPERMis, respectively, are possible fundamental ingredients for our algorithm, it is useful to recall in some detail how these chain growth algorithms work. The main difference in comparison with the\noriginal PERM is that, if the sample of chains of length\nn \u2212 1 shall be enriched, the continuations to an unoccupied next-neighbour site have to be different, i.e., the\nweights of these chains with length n can differ. Therefore it is impossible to calculate a uniform weight like\nWnPERM as given in Eq. (3) before deciding whether to\nenrich, to prune, or simply to continue the current chain\nof length n\u22121. As proposed in Ref. [6], it is therefore useful to control the population on the basis of a predicted\nweight Wnpred which is introduced as\nnPERMss\nis\n\nWnpred = Wn\u22121\n\nmn\nX\n\nnPERMss\nis\n\n\u03c7\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nwhere mn denotes the number of free neighbouring\nsites to continue with the nth monomer. The \"impornPERMss\nis\ntances\" \u03c7\u03b1\ndiffer for nPERMss and nPERMis.\nDue to its characterisation as a simple sampling algorithm (nPERMss), where all continuations are equally\nprobable, and as a method with importance sampling\n(nPERMis), the importances may be defined as\n\u03c7nPERMss\n= 1,\n\u03b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212\u03b2(En(\u03b1) \u2212En\u22121 )\n(\u03b1)\ne\n.\n\u03c7nPERMis\n=\nm\n+\n\u03b1\nn\n2\n\n(15)\n(16)\n(\u03b1)\n\nThe expression for nPERMis involves the energy En of\nthe choice \u03b1 \u2208 [1, mn ] for placing the nth monomer and\n(\u03b1)\nthe number of free neighbours mn of this choice which\nis identical with mn+1 , provided the \u03b1th continuation\n\nwas indeed selected for placing the nth monomer. Since\n\u03c7nPERMis\ncontains informations beyond the nth continu\u03b1\nation of the chain, nPERMis controls the further growth\nbetter than nPERMss. The predicted weight for the nth\nmonomer is now used to decide how the growth of the\nchain is continued. If the predicted weight is bigger than\nthe current threshold, Wnpred > Wn> , and mn > 1, the\nsample of chains is enriched and the number of copies\nk is determined according to the empirical rule k =\nmin[mn , int(Wnpred /Wn> )]. Thus, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 mn different\ncontinuations will be followed up. Using nPERMss, the k\ncontinuations are chosen randomly with equal probability\namong the mn possibilities, while for nPERMis the probability of selecting a certain k-tuple A = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k } of\ndifferent continuations is given by\nP\n\u03c7\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208A\nP\nP\npA =\n.\n(17)\n\u03c7\u03b1\nA \u03b1\u2208A\n\nConsidering the probabilities pA as partial intervals of\ncertain length, arranging\nthem successively in the total\nP\ninterval [0, 1] (since A pA = 1), and drawing a random\nnumber r \u2208 [0, 1), one selects the tuple whose interval\ncontains r. This tuple of different sites is then chosen to\ncontinue the chain. The corresponding weights are [6]:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(\u03b1 )\n\u2212\u03b2 En j \u2212En\u22121\nmn\nnPERMss\nnPERMss\nis\nis\n\u0013 e\n\u0012\n= Wn\u22121\nWn,\u03b1j\n,\nmn\npA\nk\nk\n(18)\nwhere j \u2208 {1, . . . , k} is the index of the \u03b1j th continuation within the tuple A. In the special case of simnPERMss\n=\nple sampling this expression reduces to Wn,\u03b1\nj\n(\u03b1 )\n\nnPERMss\nWn\u22121\nmn exp[\u2212\u03b2(En j \u2212 En\u22121 )]/k. If the predicted\nweight is less than the lower threshold, Wnpred < Wn< ,\nhowever, the growth of this chain is stopped with probability 1/2. In this case, one traces the chain back to\nthe last branching point, where the growth can be continued again, or, if there are no branching points, a new\ntour is started. If the chain survives, the continuation\nof the chain follows the same procedure as described\nabove, butPnow with k = 1, where Eq. (17) simplifies to\npA = \u03c7\u03b1 / \u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 since A = {\u03b1}. In this case the weight\nof the chain is taken twice. For Wn< \u2264 Wnpred \u2264 Wn> , the\nchain is continued without enriching or pruning (once\nmore with k = 1).\nThe first tour, where the nth monomer is attached for\nthe first time, is started with bounds set to Wn> = \u221e and\nWn< = 0, thus avoiding enrichment and pruning. For the\nfollowing tours, we use\n\nWn> = C\n\nZn c2n\n,\nZ1 c21\n\n(19)\n\nwhere Z1 \u2261 c1 is the partition function of chains with\nlength unity and ci the number of created chains with i\nmonomers. The constant C \u2264 1 is some positive number\n\n\f5\nand controls the number of successfully generated chains\nper tour. For the lower bound we use Wn< = 0.2Wn> . All\nthese choices are in correspondence to Ref. [6].\n\ngn (E) \u223c\n\nB. Multicanonical Sampling of\nRosenbluth-Weighted Chains\n\nThe idea behind our multicanonical chain growth\nmethod is to flatten the canonical energy distribution\nprovided by nPERMss\nis . For a given temperature, the\nlatter algorithms yield accurate canonical distributions\nover some orders of magnitude. In order to construct\nthe entire density of states, standard reweighting procedures may be applied, requiring simulations for different temperatures [3]. The low-temperature distributions are, however, very sensitive against fluctuations of\nweights which inevitably occur because the number of\nenergetic states is low, but the weights are high. Thus,\nit is difficult to obtain a correct distribution of energetic\nstates, since this requires a reasonable number of hits of\nlow-energy states. Therefore we assign the chains an additional weight, the multicanonical weight factor Wnflat ,\nchosen such that all possible energetic states of a chain of\nlength n possess almost equal probability of realisation.\nThe first advantage is that states having a low Boltzmann\nprobability compared to others are hit more frequently.\nSecondly, the multicanonical weights introduced in that\nmanner are proportional to the inverse canonical distribution at temperature T , Wnflat (E) \u223c 1/Pncan,T (E), respective the inverse density of states\nWnflat (E) \u223c gn\u22121 (E)\n\nTaking this as the probability for generating chains of\nlength n, pn \u223c Wn , leads to the desired flat distribution\nHn (E), from which the density of states is obtained by\n\n(20)\n\nHn (E)\n.\nWnflat (E)\n\nThe canonical distribution at any temperature T is calculated by simply reweighting the density of states to this\ntemperature, Pncan,T (E) \u223c gn (E) exp (\u2212E/T ).\nC.\n\nIterative Determination of the Density of States\n\nIn the following, we describe our procedure for the iterative determination of the multicanonical weights, from\nwhich we obtain an estimate for the density of states.\nSince there are no informations about an appropriate\nchoice for the multicanonical weights in the beginning,\nwe set them in the zeroeth iteration for all chains 2 \u2264\nflat,(0)\nn \u2264 N and energies E equal to unity, Wn\n(E) = 1,\nand the histograms to be flattened are initialised with\n(0)\nHn (E) = 0. These assumptions render the zeroeth iteration a pure nPERMss\nis run.\nSince we set \u03b2 = 0 from the beginning, the accumulated histogram of all generated chains of length n,\nX nPERMss\nis\nHn(0) (E) =\nWn,t\n\u03b4E t E ,\n(25)\nt\n\nis a first estimate of the density of states. In order to\nobtain a flat histogram in the next iteration, we update\nthe multicanonical weights\nflat,(0)\n\nfor T \u2192 \u221e. Thus, only one simulation is required and a\nmulti-histogram reweighting is not necessary. An important conceptual aspect is the fact that the multicanonical\nweight factors are unknown in the beginning and have to\nbe determined iteratively.\nBefore we discuss the technical aspects regarding our\nmethod, we first explain it more formally. The energydependent multicanonical weights are trivially introduced into the partition sum (13) as suitable \"decomposition of unity\" in the following way:\nZn =\n\n1\nMtours\n\nX\n\nnPERMss\nis\n\nWn\n\n(Xn,t )\n\nt\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\n\u00d7Wnflat (E(Xn,t )) Wnflat (E(Xn,t ))\n.\n\n(21)\n\nSince we are going to simulate at infinite temperature, we\nexpress with (20) the partition sum which then coincides\nwith the total number of all possible conformations as\nZn =\n\n1\nMtours\n\nX\n\nWnflat,(1) (E) =\n\nWn\n\n(E)\n\n(0)\nHn (E)\n\n\u2200 n, E\n\n(22)\n\nt\n\nnPERMss\nis\n\n(1)\n\nss,(i)\n\n= 1. If\nIn the simple sampling case, we still have \u03c7\u03b1\nthe sample is enriched (Wnpred > Wn> ) the weight (18) of\na chain with length n choosing the \u03b1j th continuation is\nnow replaced by\nss,is\nss,is\n= Wn\u22121\nWn,\u03b1\nj\n\nk\n\n(Xn,t )Wnflat (E(Xn,t )).\n\n(23)\n\n(26)\n\nand reset the histogram, Hn (E) = 0.\nThe first and all following iterations are multicanonical chain growth runs and proceed along similar lines\nas described above, with some modifications. The prediction for the new weight follows again (14), but the\nimportances \u03c7is\n\u03b1 (15) are in the ith iteration introduced\nas\n\u0013\n\u0012\nflat,(i)\n(\u03b1)\n(En )\n1 Wn\nis,(i)\n\u03c7\u03b1\n= m(\u03b1)\n+\n.\n(27)\nn\n2 W flat,(i) (En\u22121 )\nn\u22121\n\nflat,(i)\n\ngn (E(Xn,t ))Wn (Xn,t )\n\nwith the combined weight\nWn (Xn,t ) = Wn\n\n(24)\n\n\u0012\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nWn\n(En j )\nmn\n\u0013\n,\nflat,(i)\nmn\npA Wn\u22121 (En\u22121 )\nk\n\n(28)\n\nwhere in the simple sampling case (ss) pA and the binomial factor again cancel each other. If Wn< \u2264 Wnpred \u2264\n\n\f6\nWn> , an nth possible continuation is chosen (selected as\ndescribed for the enrichment case, but with k = 1) and\nthe weight is as in Eq. (28). Assuming that Wnpred < Wn<\nand that the chain has survived pruning (as usual with\nprobability 1/2), we proceed as in the latter case and the\nchain is assigned twice that weight. The upper threshold\nvalue is now determined in analogy to Eq. (19) via\nWn> = C\n\nZnflat c2n\n,\nZ1flat c21\n\n(29)\n\nss,is\nWn,t\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\nZnflat =\n\nX\nt\n\nis the estimated partition sum according to the new distribution provided by the weights (28) for chains with n\nmonomers and Z1flat = Z1 \u2261 c1 . Whenever a new iteration is started, Znflat , cn , Wn< are reset to zero, and Wn>\nto infinity (i.e. to the upper limit of the data type used\nto store this quantity). If a chain of length n with the\nenergy E was created, the histogram is increased by its\nweight:\nX ss,is\nHn(i) (E) =\nWn,t \u03b4Et E .\n(31)\nt\n\nFrom iteration to iteration, this histogram approaches\nthe desired flat distribution Hn (E) and after the final\niteration i = I, the density of states is estimated by\n(I)\n\ngn(I) (E) =\n\nHn (E)\nflat,(I)\n\nWn\n\n(E)\n\n,\n\n2 \u2264 n \u2264 N,\n\n(32)\n\nin analogy to Eq. (24).\nIn our simulations, we usually performed up to 30\niterations. The runs 0 to I \u2212 1 were usually terminated after 105 \u2013106 chains of total length N had been\nproduced, while in the measuring run (i = I) usually\n107 \u2013109 conformations are sufficient to obtain reasonable\nstatistics. The parameter C in Eq. (29) that controls\nthe pruning/enrichment statistics and thus how many\nchains of complete length N are generated per tour,\nwas set to C = 0.01, such that on average 10 complete\nchains were successfully constructed within each tour.\nWith this choice, the probability for pruning the current chain or enriching the sample was about 20%. In\nalmost all started tours M at least one chain achieved\nits complete length. Thus the ratio between started and\nsuccessfully finished tours Msucc is approximately unity,\nMsucc /M \u2248 1, assuring that our algorithm performed\nwith quite good efficiency.\nUnlike typical applications of multicanonical or flat\nhistogram algorithms in importance sampling schemes,\nwhere all energetic states become equally probable such\nthat the dynamics of the simulation corresponds to a random walk in energy space, the distribution to be flattened\nin our case is the histogram that accumulates the weights\n\nof the conformations. Hence, if the histogram is flat, a\nsmall number of high-weighted conformations with low\nenergy E has the same probability as a large number of\nappropriate conformations with energy E \u2032 > E carrying\nusually lower weights. Therefore the number of actual\nlow-energy hits remains lower than the number of hits of\nstates with high energy. In order to accumulate enough\nstatistics in the low-energy region, the comparative large\nnumber of generated conformations in the measuring run\nis required.\nWe have also implemented multicanonical chain\ngrowth simulations, where we were going to flatten the\n\"naked\" energy distribution, i.e., we tried to equalise\nthe number of hits for all energetic states. The problem is that this contradicts the philosophy of Rosenbluth\nchain growth methods, where the bias connected with\nthe Rosenbluth weight controls the population of samples. Therefore lowest-energy states were not \"tuned\" by\nthis bias and not hit accordingly. For applications without special focus to the low-temperature region, it may\nbe, however, an appropriate alternative to the procedure\ndescribed above and should be pursued further.\n\nV.\n\nVALIDATION AND PERFORMANCE\n\nBefore we discuss the physical results obtained with\nthe multicanonical chain growth algorithm, we first remark on tests validating the method. We compared\nthe specific heat for very short chains with data from\nexact enumeration and found that our method reproduces the exact results with high accuracy. For a chain\nwith 42 monomers, where exact results are not available, we performed a multi-histogram reweighting [13]\nfrom canonical distributions at different temperatures obtained from original nPERMis runs. Here, it turned out\nthat our method shows up a considerably higher performance (higher accuracy in spite of lower statistics at\ncomparable CPU times). We also compared with implementations based on sophisticated importance sampling Monte Carlo schemes, e.g., we have also performed\nmulticanonical sampling [1, 2] and Wang-Landau simulations [14] in combination with conformational updates\ndifferent from chain growth (e.g. move sets as described\nin Section II). For the present applications, however, all\nof these attempts proved to be less efficient.\n\nA.\n\nComparison with Results from Exact\nEnumeration\n\nAs a first validation of our method, we apply it to\na set of 14mers with some interesting properties (see\nTable I) regarding the relation between their groundstate degeneracy and the strength of the low-temperature\nconformational transition between lowest-energy states\nand compact globules [8, 15]. In finite-size systems,\n(pseudo-)transitions are usually identified through struc-\n\n\f7\nTABLE I: Sequences, hydrophobicity nH , and global minimum energy Emin with degeneracy g0ex (without rotations, reflections, and translations) of the exactly enumerated 14mers\nused for validation of our algorithm.

Usually, it is hard to obtain a quite accurate\nestimation of the fluctuations in the low-temperature region. Thus it is a good test of our method to calculate\nfluctuating quantities for the 14mers listed in Table I\nand to compare with results that are still available by\nexactly enumerating all possible 943 974 510 conformations (except translations) [15]. Therefore we determined\nwith our method the densities of states for these 14mers\nand calculated the fluctuations of the energy around the\nmean value in order to obtain the specific heat according to Eq. (7). We generated 109 chains and the results for the specific heats turned out to be highly accurate. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1, where we have\nplotted for the exemplified 14mers the relative errors\n\u03b5(T ) = |CVex (T )\u2212CV (T )|/CVex (T ) of our estimates CV (T )\ncompared with the specific heats CVex (T ) obtained by the\nexact enumeration procedure. We see that, except for\nvery low temperatures, the relative error is uniformly\nsmaller than 10\u22123\n\nB.\n\nMultiple Histogram Reweighting\n\nThe calculation of the density of states by means of\ncanonical stochastic algorithms cannot be achieved by\n\nsimply reweighting one canonical histogram, obtained for\na given temperature, to as many as necessary distributions to cover the whole temperature region, since the\noverlap between the sampled distribution and most of\nthe reweighted histograms is too small [3]. As this simple reweighting only works in a certain region around\nthe temperature the simulation was performed, a multiple application of the reweighting procedure at different sampling temperatures is necessary [13]. For the sequence of a 42mer to be studied in detail in Section VI A,\nwe performed the multiple reweighting of 5 overlapping\nhistograms obtained by separate nPERMis runs at temperatures 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.5, and 3.0 in order to estimate\nthe density of states. The histograms as well as the resulting density of states are shown in Fig. 2, where we\nhave also plotted the density of states being obtained by\nmeans of our multicanonical sampling algorithm. Each\nof the histograms contains statistics of 8 \u00d7 107 chains.\nThis number was adequately chosen such that the density of states from histogram reweighting matches within\nthe error bars of the density of states obtained with our\nalgorithm that also inherently supplies us with the absolute density of states. Note that these absolute values\ncannot be obtained by means of the multiple-histogram\nreweighting procedure, where the normalisation is initially arbitrary. Our density of states was obtained by\naccumulating statistics of 5 \u00d7 107 chains. This means\nthat 8 times more chains were necessary to approximately achieve the accuracy with the multiple histogram\nreweighting method. The iterative period for the determination of the multicanonical weights is no drawback,\nas it takes in our implementation only 10% compared to\nthe production run. Therefore we conclude that our dynamical method is more efficient and also more elegant\nthan a static reweighting scheme, where also a reliable\nestimation of statistical errors is extremely cumbersome.\n\n70\n60\n50\nlog10 g(E), 40\nlog10 H T (E)\n30\n\nT = 0.3\n\nlog10 H T (E)\n\n0.5\n0.8\n1.5\n\n3.0\n\n20\nlog10 g(E)\n10\n0\n-35\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nE\n\nFIG. 2: Histograms H T (E) obtained by single nPERMis\nruns for 5 different temperatures T = 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.5, and\n3.0 (dashed lines).

Flat-Histogram Algorithms with Update\nMechanisms Different from Chain Growth\n\nThe calculation of the density of states for heteropolymers with less than 40 monomers does not represent a\nbig challenge. It is still possible to combine generalised\nensemble methods like multicanonical sampling [1, 2] or\nthe Wang-Landau method [14] with move sets including pivot rotations to yield reasonable statistics in the\nlow-energy sector. In order to avoid the sophisticated\nimplementation of the move sets, an alternative method\ncan be used, for instance, where the conformational information is encoded in a string of letters denoting the\ndirections F(orward), B(ackward), R(ight), L(eft), U(p),\nand D(own) the walker may follow in an embedded coordinate system. This structural sequence is then updated\nby simply changing a letter. All these methods require a\ntime-consuming self-avoidance check following each update. We have tested these combination of sampling and\nupdate methods for 14mers, where we could compare\nwith exact results from enumeration, and applied it to a\n30mer with 20 energy states with rather high degeneracies. All these states were frequently hit such that the results were reasonable for all temperatures. Remarkably,\nit turned out, however, that the sampling of low-energy\nstates becomes more problematic the lower the degeneracy of these states is. Either the algorithm got stuck\nafter hitting such a state, or it took a long time to find it\nfor the first time. These were indications for a \"hidden\"\nconformational barrier that could not be circumvented\nwith these procedures.\nApplying these methods to sequences with more than\n40 monomers did not yield reliable results. Low-energy\nstates were too rarely or never hit in long-term simulations. Performing a biased simulation by explicitly starting from a state with lowest energy, i.e., initialising with\na very dense conformation it took much too long until a\nnew self-avoiding conformation was found and accepted.\nComparing this with applications of the multicanonical\nchain growth method to these examples led us to the conclusion that, in the application to lattice proteins, chain\ngrowth methods are much more capable of avoiding such\nbarriers.\n\nVI.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn the following we focus on results which we obtained with the multicanonical chain growth algorithm\nfor heteropolymers with HP sequences of more than 40\nmonomers.\n\nA.\n\nLattice Model for Parallel \u03b2 Helix with 42\nMonomers\n\nWe consider a 42mer with the sequence PH2 PHPH2 PHPHP2 H3 PHPH2 PHPH3 P2 HPHPH2 PHPH2 P that\n\n0\n0th\n\n-5\n1st\n\n-10\n-15\n\ng E)\n\nlog10 (\n\n-20\n\n6th\n9th\n\n-25\n-30\n-35\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\nE\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n(i)\n\nFIG. 3: Estimates for the density of states g42 (E) for the\n42mer after different levels of iteration.

Moreover, the specific heat has a very pronounced low-temperature peak\nthat indicates a (pseudo-)transition between the lowestenergy states possessing compact hydrophobic cores and\nthe regime of the globule conformations. This transition\nis in addition to the usual one between globules and random coils.\nFigure 3 shows how the estimate for the density of\nstates of this 42mer evolves with increasing number of\niterations. The 0th iteration is the initial pure nPERMis\nrun at \u03b2 = 0. This does not render, however, a proper\nimage of the abilities of nPERMis which works much better at finite temperatures. Iterations 1 to 8 are used to\ndetermine the multicanonical weights over the entire energy space E \u2208 [\u221234, 0]. Then, the 9th iteration is the\nmeasuring run which gives a very accurate estimate for\nthe density of states covering about 25 orders of magnitude.

Here and in the following figures, the statistical errors were estimated by using the jackknife binning\nmethod [18]. The pronounced minimum in the end-toend distance can be interpreted as an indication of the\ntransition between the lowest-energy states and globules:\nThe low number of ground states have similar and highly\nsymmetric shapes (due to the reflection symmetry of the\nsequence) but the ends of the chain are polar and therefore they are not required to reside close to each other.\nIncreasing the temperature allows the protein to fold into\nconformations different from the ground states and contacts between the ends become more likely. Therefore,\nthe mean end-to-end distance decreases and the protein\nhas entered the globule \"phase\". Further increasing the\ntemperature leads then to a disentangling of the globules\nand random coil conformations with larger end-to-end\ndistances dominate.

The situation\nis much more diffuse in the temperature region, where\nthe globule \u2013 random coil transition should take place.\n2\nThe variance of the energy \u03c3E\nhas a peak at T = 0.73,\nnear the temperatures of the corresponding peaks of the\nderivatives (34) and (35) plotted in Fig. 5. The variances\n2\nof the end-to-end distance \u03c3ee\nand the radius of gyra2\ntion \u03c3gyr , however, do not exhibit at all a peak near this\ntemperature. Obviously, there is no unique behaviour of\nthese quantities which are usually used to identify conformational transitions in this temperature region. In Fig. 7\ncan,T\nwe have plotted the canonical distributions P42\n(E) for\ndifferent temperatures in the vicinity of the two transitions. From Fig. 7(a) we read off that the distributions\npossess two peaks at temperatures within that region\nwhere the ground-state \u2013 globule transition takes place.\nThis is interpreted as indication of a \"first-order-like\"\ntransition [19]. The behaviour in the vicinity of the globule \u2013 random coil transition is less spectacular as can be\nseen in Fig. 7(b), and since the energy distribution shows\nup one peak only, this transition could be denoted as being \"second-order-like\".

Fig. 6.\nFor higher temperatures, the distributions become narrower again.\nSince finite-size scaling is impossible because of\nthe non-continuable sequences of different types of\nmonomers, \"transitions\" between classes of protein\nshapes are, of course, to be distinguished from phase\ntransitions in the strict thermodynamic sense. In conclusion, conformational transitions for polymers of finite\nsize, such as proteins, are usually weak and therefore\ndifficult to identify. Thus, these considerations are, of\ncourse, of limited thermodynamic significance. From a\ntechnical point of view, however, it is of some importance\nas Markovian Monte Carlo algorithms can show up problems with sampling the entire energy space, as the probability in the gap between the two peaks can be suppressed\nby many orders of magnitude (what is obviously not the\ncase in our example of the 42mer) and tunnelings are\nextremely rare. Just for such situations, flat histogram\nalgorithms have primarily been developed [1, 2].\nB.\n\nTen Designed 48mers\n\nWe have also analysed the ten designed sequences with\n48 monomers given in Ref. [20]. The ratio between the\nnumbers of hydrophobic and polar residues is one half for\nthese HP proteins, i.e., the hydrophobicity is nH = 24.\nIn Table II we have listed the sequences and groundstate properties. The minimum energies we found coincide with the values given in Refs. [6, 7, 20]. Figure 8\nshows the densities of states for selected 48mers and the\nmulticanonical histograms of the production run. Note\nthat for Rosenbluth chain growth methods (a-thermal\nor at \u03b2 = 0) the histogram for chains of length N is\nobtained by accumulating their individual Rosenbluth\nweights WNR , which explains the poorer performance near\nthe minimum energy, where a small number of states enters with big weights. This differs from the usual procedure in algorithms with importance sampling, where\n\n\f11\n0.17\n\n1.2\n1.0\n\n48.1\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\nCV (T )/N\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\n0.11\nN\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\n0.4\n\n0.07\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.13\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n48.2\n\n0.15\nCV (T )/N\n0.13\n\n0.8\n\n0.11\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n0.03\n1.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.07\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n48.3\n\n0.15\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n1.0\n\n0.13\nhRee i(T )\n,\n0.11\nN\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\n0.4\n\n0.07\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.03\n1.0\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.15\nCV (T )/N\n0.13\n0.11\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n0.15\n\nCV (T )/N\n\n1.0\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\n0.11\nN\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\n0.4\n\n0.07\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n0.2\n\n0.07\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.03\n1.0\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\n0.11\nN\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.07\n\n0.2\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.13\nCV (T )/N\n0.11\n\n0.07\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n48.9\n\n0.05\n0.03\n1.0\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.2\n\n0.07\n0.05\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n0.4\n\n0.5\nT\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.03\n1.0\n0.17\n\n48.8\n\n0.15\n0.13\nCV (T )/N\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n0.11\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.07\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.05\n0.03\n1.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.03\n1.0\n\n0.17\n\n1.2\n\n0.13\n0.11\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.15\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n0.05\n\nT\n\nCV (T )/N\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.17\n\n0.4\n\n0.03\n1.0\n\n0.15\n\nT\n1.2\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n1.0\n\n0.13\n\nCV (T )/N\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n0.15\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.7\n\nT\n\n48.7\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.17\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.17\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n48.6\n\nT\n1.2\n1.0\n\n0.05\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\n0.3\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\n\n0.13\n\n0.2\n\n0.03\n1.0\n\nT\n\n48.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.17\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.17\n\nT\n1.2\n1.0\n\n0.7\n\n48.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\nCV (T )/N\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\nT\n\n0.17\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.05\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n\nT\n1.2\n1.0\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\nN\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n\n0.17\n\n1.2\n\n0.15\n\n48.10\n\n0.15\n\nCV (T )/N\n\n0.13\n\n0.8\n\n0.11\n\nCV (T )\n0.6\nN\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.09 hRgyr i(T )\nN\n\nhRee i(T )/N\n\n0.4\n\n0.07\n\nhRgyr i(T )/N\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nhRee i(T )\n,\nN\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.05\n0.03\n1.0\n\nT\n\nFIG. 10: Heat capacities CV (T ), mean end-to-end distances hRee i(T ), and mean radii of gyration hRgyr i(T ) of the ten designed\n48mers from Table II.\n\n\f12\nTABLE II: Properties of the 48mers.

These results were obtained by means\nof the density of states as sampled with our algorithm.\nFor T \u2192 0 the curves for both hEi and F merge into\nthe four different values of Emin (= \u221234, \u221233, \u221232,\n\u221231) while the entropy exhibits the ground-state degeneracies, S \u2192 ln g0 . Our estimates for the degeneracies g0 of the ground-state energies, and for compar<\ngiven in Ref. [20], are\nison, the lower bounds gCHCC\nlisted in Table II. The lower bounds were obtained\nwith the constrained-based hydrophobic core construction (CHCC) method [21]. Our values lie indeed above\nthese lower bounds or include it within the range of statistical errors. Notice that for the sequences 48.1, 48.5,\nand 48.8, our estimates for the ground-state degeneracy\n<\n. In these cases\nare much higher than the bounds gCHCC\nthe smallest frame containing the entire hydrophobic core\nis rather large (cube containing 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 36 monomers\nwith surface area A = 32 [bond length]2 ) such that enumeration of this frame is cumbersome. For 48.5 and 48.8,\nwe further found ground-state conformations lying in less\ncompact frames (48.5: A = 32, 40, 42, 48, 52, 54 [bond\nlength]2 , 48.8: A = 32, 40, 42 [bond length]2 ) and those\nconformations would require still more effort to be identified with the CHCC algorithm, which was designed to locate global energy minima and therefore starts the search\nbeginning from the most compact hydrophobic frames.\nThe ground-state energies of these examples are rather\nhigh (Emin = \u221231 for 48.8, and Emin = \u221232 for 48.1\nand 48.5) and therefore a higher degeneracy seems to be\nnatural. This is, however, only true, if there does not\nexist a conformational barrier that separates the compact H-core low-energy states from the general compact\nglobules.

The HP proteins 48.2, 48.3, and 48.9,\nwhich have the lowest minimum energy Emin = \u221234\namong the examples in Table II, have also the lowest\nground-state degeneracies. These three candidates seem\nindeed to exhibit a rather strong ground-state \u2013 globule\ntransition, as can be read off from the associated specific\nheats in Fig. 10.\nWe have again measured the mean end-to-end distances and mean radii of gyration which are also plotted\nas functions of temperature into Fig. 10. Both quantities usually serve to interpret the conformational compactness of polymers. For HP proteins, the end-to-end\ndistance is strongly influenced, however, by the types of\nmonomers attached to the ends of the chain. It is easily seen from the figures that the 48mers with sequences\nstarting and ending with a hydrophobic residue (48.1,\n48.2, and 48.6) have a smaller mean end-to-end distance\nat low temperatures than the other examples from Table II. The reason is that the ends can form hydrophobic\ncontacts and therefore a reduction of the energy can be\nachieved. Thus, in these cases contacts between ends are\nusually favourable and the mean end-to-end distance is\nclose to the mean radius of gyration. Interestingly, there\nexists indeed a crossover region, where hRee i < hRgyr i.\nComparing with the behaviour of the specific heat, this\ninterval is close to the region, where the phase dominated by low-energy states crosses over to the globulefavoured phase. The hydrophobic contact between the\nends is strong enough to resist the thermal fluctuations\nin that temperature interval. The reason is that, once\nsuch a hydrophobic contact between the ends is estab-\n\n\f13\nlished, usually other in-chain hydrophobic monomers are\nattracted and form a hydrophobic core surrounding the\nend-to-end contact. Thus, before the contact between\nthe ends is broken, an increase of the temperature first\nleads to a melting of the surrounding contacts. The entropic freedom to form new conformations is large since\nthe low-energy states are all relatively high degenerate\nand do not possess symmetries requiring an appropriate\namount of heat to be broken. For sequences possessing\nmixed or purely polar ends, the mean end-to-end distance and mean radius of gyration differ much stronger,\nas there is no energetic reason, why the ends should be\nnext neighbours.\nIn conclusion, we see that for longer chains the strength\nof the low-temperature transition not only depends\non low ground-state degeneracies as it does for short\nchains [15]. Rather, the influence of the higher-excited\nstates cannot be neglected. A striking example is sequence 48.4 with rather low ground-state degeneracy, but\nonly weak signals for a low-temperature transition.\n\nC.\n\nBeyond 100 Monomers ...\n\nThe final example we applied our algorithm to was\na 103mer as proposed in Ref. [22]. Until recently, the\n\"ground state\" was believed to have energy Emin =\n\u221249 [23]. The up-to-now best estimate was found with\nnPERMis to be Emin = \u221254 [6] and, with an additional\nbias suppressing contacts between H and P monomers,\neven Emin = \u221255 [7]. Our algorithm not only decreased\nthe lowest-energy value to Emin = \u221256 (see Fig. 11), but\nalso enabled us to obtain results for the thermodynamic\nquantities as in the previous examples. Figure 12 shows\nthe density of states which covers more than 50 orders of\nmagnitude from which we determined the specific heat\nshown in Fig. 13. The degeneracy of the lowest-energy\nstate Emin = \u221256 was determined to be of order 1016\nsuch that it seems likely that there exist still one or more\neven lower-lying energetic states.\n\n70\n\n60\n\ng E)\n\n50\n\nlog10 (\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\nE\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nFIG. 12: Density of states for the 103mer, ranging over more\nthan 50 orders of magnitude.\n\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn order to study heteropolymers at very low temperatures with reasonable accuracy, we developed a multicanonical chain growth algorithm based on recently improved variants of PERM. Comparing with exact enumeration data for HP lattice proteins with 14 monomers,\nwe validated that our method is suitable to accurately determine thermodynamic quantities for all temperatures.\nThen, we applied this algorithm to lattice proteins with\nsequences of more than 40 monomers known from literature. Additionally, we determined statistical properties for all temperatures for examples with up to 103\nmonomers. Since our algorithm allows the estimation of\nthe degeneracy of the energy states, we determined for\nall sequences the ground-state degeneracy as it is an indication for the \"uniqueness\" of the native state.\nIn particular, we presented a detailed investigation of a\nsequence of 42 monomers that has interesting characteristic properties, e.g., a quite low ground-state degeneracy.\nSince some results regarding the ground states and thermodynamic properties were available [19] it was a good\ncandidate for testing our algorithm and for checking the\nperformance of our method. For this sequence we analysed in detail the temperature-dependent behaviour of\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n\nC V (T )\nN\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\nFIG. 11: Conformation of the 103mer with the lowest energy\nfound, Emin = \u221256.\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nT\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nFIG. 13: Specific heat of the 103mer.\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n\f14\nradius of gyration, end-to-end distance, as well as their\nfluctuations, and compared it with the specific heat in\norder to elaborate relations between characteristic properties of these curves (peaks, \"shoulders\") and conformational transitions not being transitions in a strict thermodynamic sense due to the impossibility to formulate a\nthermodynamic limit for proteins. Therefore, we identified temperature regions, where global changes of protein\nconformations occur.\nFurthermore, we studied energetic and conformational\nthermodynamic quantities for the famous list of ten\n48mers given in Ref. [20] in great detail. These are nice\nexamples as they allow for the comparison of lattice proteins with similar properties (same number of monomers,\nidentical hydrophobicity) but sequences that differ in the\n\norder of hydrophobic and polar monomers. This also\nallowed us to study how conformational properties and\nthe strength of shape transitions depend on the protein\nsequence. As an interesting by-product, we not only\nconfirmed the known global-minimum energies for these\nexamples, but we even found a new minimum for the\n103mer being the longest sequence under consideration.\n\n[1] B.
