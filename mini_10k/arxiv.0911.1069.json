These objects have a large star\nformation rate per unit area compared to normal galaxies,\nand the time it would take to produce the current stellar\nmass at the current star formation rate is much less than the\nage of the Universe. These equivalent definitions (Kennicutt\n1998) cover galaxies with a wide variety of properties at\ndifferent redshifts. Distant Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs)\n(Steidel et al. 1996; Lowenthal et al. 1997), and closer Blue\nCompact Dwarfs (BCDs) (Cair\u00f3s et al. 2001) and Luminous\nCompact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) (Werk et al. 2004) fall under this category. This denotes their cosmological relevance\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jgallego@astro.ufl.edu\n\nand turns local starburst galaxies into unique laboratories\nto study the complex ecosystem of the star formation process throughout time when they can be properly and equally\nselected at different epochs of the Universe.\nLCBGs are small starburst systems that dominate\nthe number density of optically selected galaxies at z \u223c\n1 (Ferguson et al. 2004). The most comprehensive study\nof LCBGs at intermediate redshift to date is that of\nPhillips et al. (1997) and Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1997), who concluded that the LCBG class is a populated mixture of starbursts. About 60% of galaxies in their sample are classified\nas \"H II-like\" since they are similar to today's population\nof luminous, young, star-forming H II galaxies. The remaining 40% are classified as \"SB disk-like\" since they form a\nmore heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts similar to local starburst disk nuclei and giant irregular galaxies.\nFrom an observational point of view, LCBGs are, as\n\n\f2\n\nJ. P\u00e9rez-Gallego et al.\n\ndescribed by Werk et al. (2004), objects with (i) absolute\nblue magnitude (MB ) brighter than -18.5; (ii) effective surface brightness (SBe ) brighter than 21 B-mag arcsec\u22122 ; and\n(iii)(B \u2212 V ) color bluer than 0.6. In this observational parameter space defined by MB , SBe (B), and (B \u2212 V ), LBGs\nand the intermediate redshift LCBGs share the same optical properties. One can argue that the sharp borders used\nto classify them are artificial, but they serve the purpose of\nidentifying similar objects over a very large range of redshift, from z \u223c 0 to z \u223c 2. For instance, if one considers the limiting magnitude of deep wide-field Hubble Space\nTelescope imaging (IAB = 26 for extended objects with\nSBe (IAB ) = 24.5 mag arcsec\u22122 according to Scoville et al.\n(2007)), these limits correspond to rest-frame MB \u223c \u221218.5\nand SBe (B) \u223c 21 mag arcsec\u22122 . These selection criteria\nidentify objects not only with similar observational properties but also with similar physical properties. The galaxies\nin this morphologically heterogeneous starburst population\nform stars at around 10 \u2013 20 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , show velocity widths\nof 30 \u2013 120 km s\u22121 , are as compact as Re \u223c 2 \u2013 5 kpc, and\nhave metallicitites lower than solar.\nIn the last decade, various observational studies have\nhighlighted the key role that LCBGs play in galaxy evolution\nover cosmological time scales. We know now that LCBGs\ncontribute the most to the evolution of the blue L\u22c6 galaxies\nin the last \u223c 8 Gyrs (Lilly et al. 1998; Mall\u00e9n-Ornelas et al.\n1999; Melbourne et al. 2007). LCBGs are as well a major contributor to the observed increase in the star formation rate density of the universe from z = 0 to z \u223c\n1 (Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1997; Noeske et al. 2007; Vergani et al.\n2008). And, finally, and more interesting from a cosmological point of view, LCBGs may be lower mass counterparts\nof the star-forming galaxy population at z \u223c 3, including\nLBGs (Steidel et al. 2003).\nIn addition, LCBGs might hold the key to understanding the physical mechanisms that link the red and\nblue galaxy sequences. This division is one important observational result derived from color-magnitude diagrams\n(Cattaneo et al. 2006), but also seen in the luminosity function (Baldry et al. 2004; Bell et al. 2003), the joint color and\nstellar mass distribution (Baldry et al. 2004; Balogh et al.\n2004; Hogg et al. 2004), the stellar age and the star formation rate (SFR) (Kauffmann et al. 2003), the gas-to-stellar\nmass ratio (Kannappan 2004), and their local environment\n(Blanton et al. 2006). Current models explain both a truncation in the stellar mass of the blue sequence at M \u223c\n3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , and the break out of the red sequence at z\n\u223c 1.5 (Cattaneo et al. 2006). Galaxies grow along the blue\nsequence until gas accretion is halted by the critical shockheating mass of the host halo. They then redden and fade\nin luminosity, moving up to the red sequence, whose bright\nend is reached either by dissipationless or gas-rich mergers.\nThe majority of L\u22c6 galaxies at z > 1 are intrinsically bright,\nsmall and blue, and lie close to the critical stellar mass of\nthe blue sequence and at the bright end of the ubiquitous\nintermediate-z blue galaxy population that dominates the\nnumber counts in deep optical surveys. Therefore, LCBGs,\nwhich populate the high mass end of the blue sequence, are\nkey to explaining any scenario that deals with the division\nof galaxies into a blue and a red sequence.\nFurthermore, the lack of LCBGs in the local universe\n(Werk et al. 2004) raises the issue of how such an ubiqui-\n\ntous population has evolved over the last 9 \u2013 10 Gyr. Some\nauthors suggest LCBGs may be the progenitors of today's\nspheroidal galaxies and/or the spheroidal component of today's disk galaxies; both evolutionary scenarios are in agreement with the Cattaneo et al. (2006) model. The former are\nlow-mass (M < 1010 M\u2299 ) spheroidal galaxies or dwarf elliptical galaxies whose properties according to evolutionary\nmodels would be matched by a typical LCBG after a 4 \u2013\n6 Gyr fading process (Koo et al. 1994; Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1998;\nNoeske et al. 2006). The latter are present day small spirals, more massive (M \u223c 1010 M\u2299 ) than inferred from virial\nmasses, whose emission is mostly due to a vigorous central\nburst (Phillips et al. 1997; Hammer et al. 2001; Puech et al.\n2006).\nA key ingredient in the discussion of whether LCBGs\nevolve one way or another is their mass. A reliable determination of their masses is necessary to properly place LCBGs\nwithin one evolution scenario or the other, or to understand\nwhat makes them evolve one way or the other. Masses of\nLCBGs can be derived from their rotation curves and velocity widths, nevertheless one needs to be careful with those,\nsince most of these objects' kinematics might not be coupled\nto their masses due to supernova galactic winds, and minor\nand major mergers. While a thorough study of the kinematics of each galaxy solves this issue at lower redshifts where\nwe might be able to spatially resolve any kinematic decoupled component, at higher redshifts we need to be careful\nwhen coupling these objects' kinematics to their masses.\nInterest in LCBGs has multiplied following the initial observational results and theoretical models highlighted above, but their relation to today's galaxy population still remains unknown. In order to understand\nthe nature of LCBGs and its role in galaxy evolution\nwe have selected a representative sample of 21 LCBGs\nwithin 100 Mpc from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\n(Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2006), Universidad Complutense\nde Madrid (UCM) (Zamorano et al. 1994), and Markarian (Markarian et al. 1989) catalogs that best resemble the\nproperties of the distant LCBGs, ensuring that this sample,\nalthough small, is representative of the LCBG population\nas a class by covering the whole range in luminosity, color,\nsurface brightness, and environment. We are carrying out\na multiwavelength study of these nearby LCBGs, including\nthe optical, millimeter, and centimeter ranges. In this paper\nwe focus on the optical three dimensional (3D) spectroscopy\nof a single LCBG, NGC 7573. Garland et al. (2007) present\nour initial HI and CO results. The optical is the best understood spectral range in nearby galaxies, and systematic\nstudies at intermediate- and high-z with the new generation of near-infrared multi-object spectrographs and integral field units in 10-m class telescopes have already started\n(F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006; Puech et al. 2006). The derived 3D maps allow us to test model predictions on the\norigin and evolution of these massive starbursts. Insights\nabout the role of mergers and supernova galactic winds can\nbe obtained by, for instance, identifying decoupled kinematic\ncomponents within the velocity fields of these objects and\ncross-correlating these kinematic components with morphological information. Furthermore, clues about the trigger\nmechanism for the current burst in such galaxies may be\nfound.\nNGC 7673 (also known as MRK 325 and UCM\n\n\f3D Spectroscopy of Local Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies: Kinematics of NGC 7673\n\n3\n\nerties of NGC 7673 and compare the kinematical properties of the ionized gas to those of the neutral atomic\ngas (Garland et al. 2007).

Furthermore, its small size, high surface brightness,\nstrong emission lines and blue colors make of NGC 7673 a\nprototypical LCBG (see Table 1).\nH I 21 cm line mapping of NGC 7673 and its environment (Nordgren et al. 1997), which includes neighboring galaxy NGC 7677, roughly 7' to the southeast (3554 vs.\n3405 km s\u22121 ) (HG99) shows a small outer irregularity that\npoints to the latter. Nevertheless, a present major merger\nscenario has been rejected because of a remarkably constant velocity across the galaxy (Duflot-Augarde & Alloin\n1982). HG99 used data taken with DENSEPAK to study\nthe kinematics of a portion of the galaxy. They were limited\nby the pointing of the telescope and both the field of view\n(30 \u00d7 45 arcsec2 ) and the spatial resolution of the instrument. Their spatial resolution sampling of two thirds of the\ngalaxy, as seen in optical images, is highly improved by our\nsampling. Nevertheless, their spectral resolution (FWHM\n= 32 km s\u22121 ) allowed them to find that a two component\nmodel, one narrow (FWHM \u223c 55 km s\u22121 ) and one broad\n(FWHM \u223c 150 km s\u22121 ) fit the observed spectra. According\nto their analysis three are the possible explanations for the\npresence of such a broad component: (i) a consequence of\nintegrating over many ionized structures at different velocities; (ii) hot, turbulent gas confined to large cavities carved\nout by massive stars; and (iii) a starburst-powered galactic\nwind or similar break-out phenomenon. Furthermore, they\nexclude a present, but not past, interaction between NGC\n7673 and NGC 7677, indicating a minor merger as the trigger mechanism for the major starburst.\nIn this paper we focus on the optical kinematic prop-\n\n2.1\n\nSAMPLE SELECTION, OBSERVATIONS,\nAND DATA REDUCTION\nSample Selection\n\nOur sample of LCBGs in the local universe was chosen from the the Data Release 4 (DR4) of the\nSDSS (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2006), the UCM Survey (Zamorano et al. 1994), and the Markarian catalog\n(Markarian et al. 1989). The B magnitudes (MB ), surface\nbrightnesses (SBe ), colors (B \u2212 V ), and sizes (re ), of the\ncandidate objects in these catalogs were taken into account to select them as described in the Introduction, i.e.,\nMB < \u221218.5; SBe > 21 B-mag arcsec\u22122 ; and(B \u2212 V )< 0.6.\nFurthermore, objects with sizes larger than 4 arcsec and\ncloser than 100 Mpc were given priority to take full advantage of the instrument used. This yielded a sample of 22\nnearby LCBGs.\n2.2\n\nObservations\n\nObjects from our sample were observed using PPAK\n(Kelz et al. 2006) at the 3.5-m telescope in the Centro Astron\u00f3mico Hispano Alem\u00e1n1 (CAHA). PPAK is an integral\nfield unit (IFU) consisting of 331 science fibers with a diameter of 2.7 arcsec each, covering an hexagonal field of view\n(FOV) of 74 x 65 arcsec2 . Furthermore, there are 15 calibration fibers, and 36 sky fibers located 80 arcsec away from\nthe centre of the hexagonal FOV.\nPPAK observations of NGC 7673 were made during the\nnights of 2005 August 10 and 11 using two different setups (see Table 2). First, a 300 lines mm\u22121 grating (V300)\ncentered at 5316 \u00c5 was used. This low resolution configuration provided a spectral resolution of 10.7 \u00c5 FWHM\n(\u03c3 \u223c 255 km s\u22121 at 5316 \u00c5) covering the spectral range\nfrom 3600 to 7000 \u00c5, including H\u03b2 and H\u03b1. Three different\ndithering positions were observed to fill the gaps between\neach fiber and its next neighbors. Three exposures 330 s\nlong were taken for a total exposure time of 990 s per dithering position. The offsets applied between the three different\ndithering positions allowed us to fully cover the field of view\nof the galaxy and overcome the presence of holes between\nfibers in the detector (see Table 2).\n1\n\nBased on observations collected at the German-Spanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the Max-PlanckInstitut f\u00fcr Astronomie Heidelberg and the Instituto de Astrofsica\nde Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (IAA/CSIC).\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

This high resolution configuration\nprovided a nominal spectral resolution of 2.78 \u00c5 FWHM\n(\u03c3 \u223c 70 km s\u22121 at 5040 \u00c5), covering the spectral range\nfrom 4900 to 5400 \u00c5, including H\u03b2 and [OIII]\u03bb5007. Again,\nthree different dithering positions were observed. Three exposures, each one 900 s long, were taken for a total exposure\ntime of 2700 s per dithering position.\n\n2.3\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe data were reduced using R3D and E3D (S\u00e1nchez 2006),\nIRAF2 and our own custom software. All the images were\nbias-subtracted, flat-fielded, and cosmic-ray cleaned. The\n331 two-dimensional spectra per dithering position were\nthen properly extracted, distortion-corrected, wavelengthcalibrated, sky-subtracted, and flux-calibrated. Corrections\nwere also applied to minimize the differences between fiberto-fiber transmission. As for differential atmospheric refraction corrections, those were not applied for not being relevant (up to 0.2 and 0.4 arcsec in the x and y respectively).\nThe V300 wavelength calibration was performed using\na He lamp with eleven lines within the considered spectral\nrange. The rms of the best fit polynomial (n = 3) was\n0.12 \u00c5. A further analysis to evaluate the accuracy of our\ncalibration including sky lines reveals a final uncertainty in\nour calibration of 0.2 \u00c5 (10 km s\u22121 at 6000 \u00c5). For this\nanalysis five high signal-to-noise (S/N) sky lines from the\nwave-calibrated spectra covering the entire V300 spectral\n\nrange were fit by single Gaussian models for each fiber. The\ncentroids of these lines were then compared to those of the\nCAHA sky atlas (S\u00e1nchez et al. 2007). The uncertainty of\nour measurements was given by the standard deviation of\nthe resulting residuals, which is consistent within the entire\nV300 spectral range (i.e. for each sky line independently).\nOn the other hand, the V1200 wavelength calibration\nwas performed using both He and Cs lamps because the\nHe lamp lacked emission lines bluer than 5015 \u00c5. The Cs\nlamp was observed separately and both lamps were added\nto increase the spectral coverage. Furthermore, weak contamination lines from the Ar lamp used to illuminate the\ncalibration fibers were also used for this purpose. The rms\nof the best fit polynomial (n = 3) translated into an uncertainty of at least 0.25 \u00c5 (15 km s\u22121 ). The lack of sky\nlines did not allow us to carry on an analysis similar to\nthe one carried out for the V300. While this is critical in\nthe case we are interested in measuring the position of the\ncentroid of the emission lines, it is not if we are only interested in measuring the velocity widths. Thus, our data\ncan be wavelength-calibrated using the rest-frame positions\nof H\u03b2, [OIII]\u03bb4959, and [OIII]\u03bb5007, to measure velocity\nwidths with the spectral resolution of the detector. For that,\nwe wavelength-calibrated each of the fibers independently.\nWhen this is done the rms for this particular spectral range\nis 0.13 \u00c5 (7 km s\u22121 ).\n\n3\n3.1\n\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities\nfor Research in Astronomy (AURA) under cooperative agreement\nwith the National Science Foundation.\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS\nData Measurements\n\nEmission lines were fit by single Gaussian profiles both in the\nlow (V300, H\u03b1) and high resolution (V1200, [OIII]\u03bb5007)\nconfigurations. A minimum S/N of 13 in the flux detection\nwas required for the measurements to be considered. Below\n\n\f3D Spectroscopy of Local Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies: Kinematics of NGC 7673\n\n5\n\nthis the uncertainty associated with low S/N dominates over\nthe wavelength calibration uncertainty as the main source\nof error, according to our simulations.\nIn the outer areas of the galaxy, we spatially binned\nthe V300 data by co-adding fibers to achieve a minimum\nS/N of 13. This way, we were able to obtain eight new measurements for dithering position one and two, and six for\ndithering position three. Furthermore, fibers from different\ndithering positions were co-added to obtain four new measurements. Each of these measurements were linked to the\naverage position of the fibers co-added. These measurements\nmake the final map extend towards the lower surface brightness outskirts of the galaxy sampling an area about 10%\nbigger than before co-adding fibers.\nThe velocity map of the galaxy was derived from the\nH\u03b1 emission lines for each dithering position with the low\nresolution spectra. The data were interpolated down to a\nspatial resolution of 1 arcsec pixel\u22121 yielding a 60 \u00d7 60 pixel\nsquare grid. Each of the original fibers (i.e., original spatial\nresolution element) is therefore sampled by approximately\n3 \u00d7 3 pixel2 (i.e., \u223c 2.7 \u00d7 2.7 arcsec2 ). This keeps us from\noversampling the data, which may result in the appearance\nof artifacts (S\u00e1nchez 2006). The three maps were then registered and averaged pixel by pixel. Thus, both the spatial\nresolution and the error associated\nwith each measurement\n\u221a\nimproved by a factor of 3 (6 km s\u22121 for the V300 and\n4 km s\u22121 for the V1200).\nThe velocity width map of the galaxy was derived from\nthe [OIII]\u03bb5007 emission lines for each dithering position\nwith the high resolution spectra. This line was selected as the\none with highest S/N within the V1200 spectral range. The\ninstrumental broadening as measured in sky lines for each\nfiber was properly subtracted. The final map was produced\nas explained above with the difference that no binning was\npursued in this case since it would artificially broaden the\nemission lines. Furthermore, as in HG99, an attempt to find\nmultiple spectral components was made but the result was\nnot conclusive due to insufficient spectral resolution.\n\nFigure 2. PPAK H\u03b1 velocity map of NGC 7673 using the low\nresolution V300 configuration. The velocity map shows an asymmetric velocity field with at least two independent kinematic components in the northern side of the galaxy.\n\n3.2\n\nFigure 3. Rotation curves along the major axis of NGC 7673 for\ntwo different position angles. From our data we derive a PA equal\nto 168\u25e6 , versus 122\u25e6 from the Hyperleda catalog. The blue side\n(dashed), red side (dotted), and an average of both sides (solid)\nof the galaxy are plotted.\n\nVelocity Map\n\nThe velocity map of NGC 7673 can be seen in Figure 2.\nMeasurements of the velocity down to our S/N limit were\npossible for a region extending 40 arcsec in diameter. This\ncompares well with the effective radius of the galaxy, which\nis 8 arcsec (re = 1.9 kpc). Further away, the S/N was not\nhigh enough to proceed to the measurement of the velocity. Border and pixelization effects due to the interpolation\nprocess were not considered in the analysis. These effects\nmanifest as either a steep increase or steep decrease of the\nvelocity towards the edges of the available data.\nThe velocity map shows an asymmetric velocity field\nthat ranges from approximately -45 to 45 km s\u22121 . The velocities shown in the map are referenced to the redshift\nof the central peak velocity width of the galaxy (see Section 3.4). No absolute calibration of the recession velocity\nwas attempted. This redshift is 0.011293, smaller, but within\ntwo sigma of the one available in the Nasa Extragalactic\nDatabase (z = 0.011368).\nThe existence of an almost straight velocity contour\nthat crosses the galaxy from East to West through the central velocity width peak suggests that it actually traces the\n\nposition of the minor axis of the galaxy, yielding a major\naxis position angle (PA) equal to 168\u25e6 . A PA of 122\u25e6 derived from optical images (taken from HyperLeda3 ) was used\nin past studies of this galaxy. A rotation curve can be derived for both position angles by reading the measured velocities along the corresponding major axis (see Figure 3).\nA PA equal to 168\u25e6 provides a smoother rotation curve\nfrom which an uncorrected by inclination rotation velocity\nof about 30 km s\u22121 can be inferred.\nWhile the southern half of the galaxy is consistently\nmoving away from the observer, the northern half is not\nuniformly moving towards. Two discrete regions located in\nthe northern half of the galaxy are moving away from the\nobserver in opposite direction to their surroundings.\nFirst, we measure a smaller circular region, about 1 kpc\n3\n\nhttp://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/\n\n\f6\n\nJ. P\u00e9rez-Gallego et al.\n\nFigure 4. PPAK H\u03b1 velocity map contours overlaid on\nthe F555W WFPC2 image of NGC 7673. Clump B from\nDuflot-Augarde & Alloin (1982) can be identified with one of the\nindependent kinematic component. There is no optical counterpart of the second one.\n\nwide, about 10 arcsec north of the centre of the FOV. This\nregion is moving away from the observer at about 35 km s\u22121\nwith respect to its surroundings. Furthermore, this region,\nalthough confined to only the area of one fiber, was detected on the three independent dithering exposures. Second, we identify a bigger elongated region, about 3.5 kpc\nlong, which is located towards the northwest, about 2 kpc\naway from clump F. This is too far from the edge of the available data for us to consider it as a border effect. This region,\nconsiderably more extended than the previous one shows a\nsmoother velocity gradient. Nevertheless, it also peaks at\naround 35 km s\u22121 with respect to its surroundings. We discuss below whether these kinematically decoupled components show physical properties that differ from the rest of\nthe galaxy.\nWhen compared to the F555W WFPC2 image of NGC\n7673 (see Figure 4) two characteristics stand out: (i) the\nvelocity field is considerably more extended than the region\nwhere the more luminous star forming regions are confined;\nand (ii) while the smaller decoupled region appears to be\nlinked to clump B, no optical counterpart can be linked to\nthe bigger one.\nWe compare our results to those of HG99 (see Figure 5).\nUsing the PPAK H\u03b1 image of the galaxy and Figure 3 from\nHG99, our and their FOV were registered by finding the position of two fibers mapping the same region of the galaxy.\nThe DENSEPAK fiber array was drawn within the rectangular FOV on their figure for that purpose. This was needed\nbecause HG99 did not state the pointing position for their\nobservations. A velocity map using their measurements was\nthen produced down to a resolution of 1 arcsec using our interpolation method and reference system. This allowed us to\ndirectly compare both maps. The residual image reveals an\noffset of 20 km s\u22121 and a standard deviation of 12 km s\u22121 .\nWhile their better spectral resolution, as stated above, allowed them to look for multiple kinematic components, both\nour FOV and spatial sampling are better, which allows us to\nextend the study of the galaxy. The only notable difference\nbetween both maps is the presence of the small circular region in our data at the position of clump B. This could be\n\nFigure 5.

Both velocity maps are consistent within their respective\nuncertainties.\n\nFigure 6. PPAK H\u03b1 velocity map contours overlaid on VLA neutral atomic hydrogen velocity map of NGC 7673. The combined\nB+C+D arrays were used for the VLA map. The size of the beam\nis 6\". Both velocity maps are consistent within their respective\nuncertainties. The offset between both might be explained by the\ntwo plane-parallel disks as discussed in the text.\n\nexplained by both the sampling an the dithering technique\nwe used. Given the size of this feature, HG99 might have\nsimple missed it in between their fibers.\n3.3\n\nNeutral Hydrogen Gas\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.2, the velocity field of the galaxy\nderived from the centroids of the H\u03b1 emission line profiles\nshows asymmetries. The neutral hydrogen velocity field resembles the ionized one (see Figure 6) in extent down to\nthe detection limits, overall appearance, and velocity range\n(\u223c 90 km s\u22121 ) (Pisano et al. in prep.).\nBoth maps were registered using the header coordinates. For the registration process several images were used:\n\n\f3D Spectroscopy of Local Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies: Kinematics of NGC 7673\nF555 HST, H\u03b1 PPAK, 6cm VLA, 20 cm VLA, and DSS.\nThe uncertainty in the registration was established to be\nno higher than half an arcsecond. When the distributions\nof H I and H II are compared there is an obvious slight\noffset between them. The H II distribution extends slightly\nmore towards the northeast while the H I one extends considerably more towards the west. This difference might be\nexplained by two plane-parallel disks. The H II disk might\nbe thicker than the H I and only the nearest side might be\nvisible to us. If an inclination of 45\u25e6 is assumed for both\ndisks, a separation of about 1.7 kpc can be derived between\nthe nearest side of the thicker H II disk and the H I disk.\nThis is in agreement with the typical scale height of a thick\ndisk (Howk & Savage 2000). Nevertheless, the uncertainties\nassociated with these estimations are quite large.\nOn top of that, a residual image was generated by subtracting the optical velocity map from the radio one for the\nshared area. The resulting mean and standard deviation are\n0 and 15 km s\u22121 , which make them consistent with each\nother. When only the receding part of the galaxy was considered these numbers were 8 and 9 km s\u22121 respectively\nindicating that there is not a cancellation effect between the\nreceding and the approaching sides of the galaxy.\nOn the other hand, while the distribution of the H I\nresembles that of the ionized gas, the H2 distribution, as\ntraced by CO observations, is concentrated along clump A\n(Garland et al. 2005); no CO was detected in clump B. It\nis to be noted that the higher column densities of H I trace\nthe location of CO. This lack of CO detection in clump B\ncould be explained if the burst was quenching, opaque to CO\nradiation, or being injected with H I through galactic winds.\nAt the current SFR (CM09) the H I still present in LCBG\nNGC7673 (MHI = 4.09 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 according to Pisano et al.\n(2001)) would be exhausted in about 1 Gyr.\n3.4\n\n7\n\nFigure 7. PPAK [OIII]\u03bb5007 velocity width map of NGC 7673\nusing the V1200 configuration. The central peak roughly coincides with the luminosity-weighted center (photometric) and the\ncenter of the outer-isophotes (geometric) of the galaxy, and is\nassumed to be the dynamical center of the galaxy. Furthermore,\nthe minor axis of the galaxy as derived from the velocity contours\ngoes through this peak.\n\nVelocity Width Map\n\nThe velocity width map of the galaxy (see Figure 7 and Figure 8) can be used in combination with the velocity map\nto better understand the kinematic properties of the galaxy.\nIn virialized systems the velocity width peak tends to coincide with the centroid of the velocity map, assuming it is\norganized rotation which dominates the galaxy motions.\nThe velocity width map of NGC 7673 peaks (\u03c3 =\n54 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 ) around the centre of the FOV (see Figure 8), between clumps A and C. This position roughly\ncoincides with the luminosity-weighted centre (photometric) and the centre of the outer-isophotes (geometric) of the\ngalaxy. These are located respectively about 3 and 4 arcsec\n(920 and 690 pc respectively) towards the west of the centre\nof the FOV; these offsets are comparable to the size of one\nfiber. The geometric centre was found as the average of the\nposition of each fiber with signal from the galaxy; while the\nphotometric centre was found as the average position of each\nfiber with signal from the galaxy weighted by its integrated\nflux. Two additional elongated peaks in velocity width as\nlarge as the central one can be found to the northeast and\nnorthwest of the galaxy. The velocity width of the galaxy\nranges from about 15 to 60 km s\u22121 within a FOV covered\nby fibers for which S/N is at least 30.\nAs for the integrated velocity width HG99 found W20 =\n126 km s\u22121 (vrot = 0.5W20 / sin i). This is slightly larger than\n\nFigure 8. PPAK [OIII]\u03bb5007 velocity width map contours overlaid on the F555W WFPC2 image of NGC 7673. North is to the\ntop and East is to the left.\n\nthe value found by Pisano et al. (2001), W20 = 119 km s\u22121\nfrom Keck echelle spectroscopy. Furthermore, Pisano et al.\n(2001) find the H II profile to be narrower than the H I profile (119 versus 164 km s\u22121 ). From our integrated velocity\nwidth measurement, we find W20 = 159 km s\u22121 , closer to\nPisano et al. (2001). We estimate W20 \u221a\nby measuring \u03c3 and\nassuming a gaussian profile (W20 = 2 2 ln 5 \u00d7 \u03c3). Differences with HG99 might be attributed to our larger FOV,\nwhich, on the other hand, is large enough to resemble that\nof the H I observations of Pisano et al. (2001). The integrated velocity width of the galaxy was also measured after\nremoving clump B without recording meaningful differences\nin our measurement.\n\n\f8\n4\n4.1\n\nJ. P\u00e9rez-Gallego et al.\nDISCUSSION\nMinor Merger Scenario\n\nAs stated above, two independent kinematic components are\nfound in NGC 7673: a compact one with an optical counterpart (clump B); and an elongated one without one. The\nindependent kinematic component found at the location of\nclump B is interesting not only because of its optical counterpart but because of further evidence for decoupling that\nwe discuss below.\nA first attempt to investigate the nature of clump B\nwas made by calculating the [OIII]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 and [NII]/H\u03b1\nratios for the entire galaxy, and this component in particular, to study the possible presence of AGN activity. Nevertheless, these ratios, around 0.3 and -0.7 dex, respectively,\nare in agreement with those of an H II region (Osterbrock\n1989). Furthermore, the pressure derived for clump B from\nthe [SII]/H\u03b1 (\u223c 0.4) and [NII]/H\u03b1 (\u223c 0.2) ratios is also\nin agreement with that of a starburst (Rickes et al. 2008).\nFor clump B and the entire galaxy those ratios are considerably smaller than those found in LINERs, in agreement\nwith those found in starburst galaxies, and only close to\nthose found in Seyfert galaxies (see Figure 12 in Rickes et al.\n(2008)).\nAs mentioned above, HG99 were able to fit the H\u03b1\nemission lines of their IFU data with two Gaussian profiles throughout most of the galaxy. In particular, before\nHG99, Taniguchi & Tamura (1987) found two (one narrow,\none broad) kinematic components at the location of clump\nB, in the H\u03b1 emission line. Nevertheless, after simulating\nthose by using their measurements in combination with our\n[OIII]\u03bb5007 emission lines, spectral resolution, and noise,\nonly a marginal detection would have been possible. Thus,\nthe possibility of finding a second broad component at the\nposition of clump B by means of the analysis of the profiles\nof our emission lines was rejected.\nAnother possibility is that clump B peculiar kinematics\nare due to galactic winds and even though, as mentioned\nabove, the quality of our data keeps us from establishing\nany final word about the nature of this region, a further\nqualitative analysis is possible based on the H\u03b2 luminosity\n(LH\u03b2 ) measured by CM09 using\nL\n\nef f\n\n\u03b1\n\nH\u03b2\nQ = h\u03bdH\u03b2\nH\u03b2 \u03b1B\n(Osterbrock 1989), where Q is the number of photons\nharder than Ly\u03b1 emitted by a star forming region, h is the\nf\nPlanck constant, \u03bdH\u03b2 is the frequency of H\u03b2, \u03b1ef\nH\u03b2 is the\ncase B H I recombination coefficient for H\u03b2, and \u03b1B is the\nrecombination coefficient for H-like ions. Assuming then that\nall the stars in the star-forming region are O7 with a mass\nof 60 M\u2299 and a Salpeter Initial Mass Function (Salpeter\n1955) we find that 18500 stars are responsible for the ionization of the gas. While this is an approximation the presence of Wolf-Rayet features in our spectra (CM09) is consistent with massive stars. If all those stars were to explode\nas supernovae with an energy of 1051 erg, the total thermal\nenergy released (E = 1.85 \u00d7 1055 erg), would be unequivocally smaller than the binding energy (\u03a9G = 5.23\u00d71057 erg)\nas defined by (Yoshii & Arimoto 1987). Galactic winds cannot be then responsible for the kinematic properties of the\ncomponent associated with clump B. If we assume the total\nthermal energy released is transformed into kinematic en-\n\nFigure 9. 12 + log (O/H) vs. MB for a sample of intermediateredshift LCBGs (Hoyos et al. 2005). The position of NGC 7673\nand clump B are also shown as measured by CM09. The dashed\nline represents the luminosity-metallicity relation for local dIrr\n(Richer & McCall 1995). The solid line represents this relation\nfor extremely metal-poor BCGs (Kunth \u00d6stlin 2000). The uncertainties of our metallicity and luminosity measurements are\nsmaller than our symbols.\n\nergy, velocities up to 20 km s\u22121 are accounted for. Such a\nlow value is in disagreement with the broad component of\nTaniguchi & Tamura (1987) and could not be detected with\nour spectral resolution.\nOn the other hand, as stated by HG99, both photometric and spectroscopic similarities between NGC 7673 and\nNGC 3310 (a well known system largely classified as a minor merger) in both H II and H I data leads to consider\nNGC 7673 as a candidate for a major starburst triggered by\na minor merger. This minor merger with a dwarf companion\nwould account for the different bursts in the inner parts of\nthe galaxy and the different morphological features, such as\narcs, in its outer parts.\nMetallicity and continuum (5600 \u2013 5800 \u00c5) measurements of CM09 show marginally higher metallicity values,\nand a secondary peak (second in intensity after the central\none) at the location of clump B respectively. The metallicity values found by CM09 for clump B and its surroundings from [OIII]\u03bb4363 are respectively 8.07 \u00b1 0.06 dex and\n7.76 \u00b1 0.06 dex. These could be explained by the presence\nof an extremely giant H II region at the location of clump\nB within a lower metallicity environment. When we compare the metallicity and MB of clump B with a sample of\nintermediate-redshift LCBGs from Hoyos et al. (2005) (see\nFigure 9) clump B, less luminous and slightly less metallic,\nfalls closer to dwarf irregulars while NGC 7673 falls within\nthe region occupied by intermediate-redshift LCBGs,\nThe H\u03b2 luminosity and the velocity width of clump\nB follow the correlation found by Melnick et al. (1987) for\nnearby giant H II regions (see Figure 10). Nevertheless,\nclump B is brighter and considerably more massive than any\nof the nearby giant H II regions within their sample. Knowing that this correlation holds from nearby H II regions and\ngalaxies to the H II-like galaxies found at intermediate-, and\nhigh-redshift (Siegel et al. 2005), suggests that an infalling\ndwarf galaxy, instead of a giant H II region at the location of\nclump B might be responsible for its peculiar behavior. If the\nminor merger scenario were to be confirmed, the elongated\nindependent kinematic component cannot be disregarded as\na possible side effect within the minor merger scenario.\nFurthermore, CM09 measurements of the equivalent\nwidths of the underlying population absorption spectral fea-\n\n\f3D Spectroscopy of Local Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies: Kinematics of NGC 7673\n\nFigure 10. LH\u03b2 vs. \u03c3 for a sample of giant HII regions\n(Melnick et al. 1987). The position of NGC 7673 and clump B\nare also shown as measured by this work (\u03c3) and CM09 (LH\u03b2 ).\nThe solid line represents the correlation between these parameters. This correlation holds from giant HII regions to similar starburst galaxies observed at high redshift (Siegel et al. 2005). The\nuncertainties of our luminosity measurements are smaller than\nour symbols.\n\ntures (e.g., H\u03b2, H\u03b3) show a peculiarity at the location of\nclump B. While the strength of these features is noticeable\nthroughout the galaxy, it is almost nonexistent at the location of clump B. The strength of the equivalent width of\nthese features account for the age of the underlying population. Strong lines are mainly due to a population of A\nclass stars and correspond to systems a few hundred thousand years old. Weaker lines are typical of either younger\nor older populations. Nonetheless, clump B shows signs of\ndecoupling or differentiation, at the least marginally, with\nrespect to its environment from the point of view of both\nthe gas and the stars. Notice that as stated above no optical\ncounterpart can be linked to the bigger elongated region,\nand we found no signs of decoupling or differentiation other\nthan the kinematic signature.\n4.2\n\nGalactic kinematics play an important role on the measurement of masses of nearby and distant galaxies. Galaxies'\nmasses are related to their kinematics via the Virial Theorem. Nevertheless, we need to be careful when making the\nassumption that an object is virialized. By studying LCBG\nNGC7673, among other examples of local counterparts of\nthe distant starburst population, we can learn whether or\nnot most of these objects are virialized and how careful we\nneed to be when inferring their masses from their kinematics.\nIf we assume for NGC 7673 a peak to peak velocity\nrange as suggested by the rotation curve derived q\nabove (\u223c\n60 km s\u22121 ), the inferred rotational velocity vrot =\n\nof the neutral hydrogen estimated by Pisano et al. (2001)\n(MHI = 4.09 \u00d7 109 ). If the system is to be virialized the\nresulting rotational velocity would be vrot = 133 km s\u22121 .\nIn order for the rotation curve derived for a PA equal to\n168\u25e6 to agree with this vrot the inclination of the galaxy\nmust be close to 15\u25e6 , which on the other hand is not unreasonable when one takes a look at the optical image of\nthe galaxy. Nevertheless, this comparison depends strongly\nin a well established mass luminosity relation and current\nstudies (Matthew Bershady, private communication) seem\nto indicate that the mass luminosity relation for this particular kind of galaxies might be as much as five times lower,\nwhich would match better our photometric and dynamical\nmass estimates.\nFrom the velocity width measurements of our integrated\nPPAK data we find W20 = 159 \u00b1 4 km s\u22121 . If an inclination equal to 15\u25e6 is also to be considered and we use the\nrelation between W20 and vrot used by Pisano et al. (2001),\nthe rotational velocity would rise to vrot = 307 km s\u22121 .\nOn the other hand, a recent study by Andersen & Bershady\n(2009) show that for low-inclination systems like NGC 7673,\n2.9 vrot = W20 / sin i. This provides an uncorrected for inclination vrot = 55 km s\u22121 , which is closer to the uncorrected\nvalue we derived from our rotation curve (30 km s\u22121 ).\nAs it is, neither the peak to peak velocity range shown\nby the optical data nor the one shown by the radio data,\nseems to account for such a large vrot even though the entire\nFOV of NCG 7673 is covered in both cases. This suggests\nthat W20 and, therefore, FWHM and \u03c3, might not good indicators of the rotational velocities and subsequent dynamical mass of starburst galaxies like NGC 7673, and mostly\naccounts for the presence of kinematically decoupled components and asymmetries alike, and their position within the\ngalaxy.\n\n5\n\nMass\n\nMdyn G\nRe\n\ntranslates into a dynamical mass within Re (Re = 1.9 kpc)\nof around 8.0 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Pisano et al. (2001) inferred a dynamical mass of 2.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 within RHI (RHI = 8.3 kpc\n\u223c 4.5 \u00d7 Re ), or 5.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 within Re . In both cases an\ninclination of 45\u25e6 is assumed.\nOn the other hand, considering the K magnitude of\nNGC 7673 and assuming the mass luminosity relation\nM/LK = 0.51 for BCDs from P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003)\nwe derive a stellar mass of 1.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . A total mass\nof 1.9 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 is then calculated by adding the mass\n\n9\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFrom our study we conclude that even though NGC 7673\nshows an asymmetrical velocity map, a dynamical centre of\nthe galaxy and a position angle can still be inferred. The\nformer coincides roughly with the geometrical and photometrical ones, while the latter is found to be 168\u25e6 . Using\nthis centre if we consider a rotation curve along the major\naxis of the galaxy we derive a rotational velocity of about\n30 km s\u22121 before inclination corrections. For this rotational\nvelocity to account for the total mass of the system inferred\nfrom the K band magnitude and HI observations an inclination of 15\u25e6 is necessary.\nThe LCBG population may or may not consistently\nshow asymmetrical velocity fields, but being NGC 7673 a\nprototypical LCBG and taking into account recent results\nby \u00d6stlin et al. (2004) and Cumming et al. (2008) on two\nLCBGs, and preliminary results on other objects in our sample, we are inclined to believe that this might be a trend\namong this population of star forming galaxies. This behavior turns our data set into essential when approaching the\nstudy of these objects and showing the importance this effect might have when trying to derive rotational velocities\nand dynamical masses from long-slit spectroscopy of distant\nvigorous starburst galaxies, including LBGs. Our data set\nhas both a wide FOV to detect the galaxy down to the low\n\n\f10\n\nJ. P\u00e9rez-Gallego et al.\n\nsurface brightness outskirts, and a high spatial resolution\nthat allows for small decoupled kinematic components to\nbe found. An example is the compact small decoupled kinematic component found at the location of clump B in NGC\n7673. As discussed in Section 4.1, clump B shows no evidence for neither AGN activity nor SNe galactic winds and\nis in agreement with being either an extremely giant H II\nregion or an infalling dwarf galaxy. Even though the latter\nscenario is plausible both spectroscopically and photometrically, a high spectral resolution study is still necessary in to\nconfirm it.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank the many people who welcomed\nour project into the 3.5-m telescope in CAHA, where we\nalways felt at home, especially those cozy snowy nights\nfull of pastries and hot chocolates.
