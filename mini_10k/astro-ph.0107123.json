Introduction\nDealing with motion of real dust particles in the Universe, it may be important to consider action of electromagnetic radiation. Usage of correct equation of motion is inevitable, in that case.\n\nPoynting-Robertson effect (Robertson 1937) was used for several decades as a model equation of motion. However, since 1994 (Kla\u010dka 1994) equations of motion for real, arbitrarily shaped, particle were presented. The\nmost complete form was presented in Kla\u010dka (2000a) \u2013 covariant form of equation of motion. Later on, approximations to the first order in v/c (v \u2013 velocity of the particle with respect to the source of radiation, c \u2013 speed\nof light) for dust particles were presented: Kla\u010dka (2000b), Kla\u010dka and Kocifaj (2001). Application to larger\nbodies may be found in Kla\u010dka (2000c).\nThis paper presents covariant equation of motion of the particle in the electromagnetic radiation field for a little\ndifferent initial formulation. It is supposed that interaction between the particle and electromagnetic radiation\nis expressed in term of radiation pressure cross section matrix.\n2. Formulation of the problem\nLet the equation of motion of a particle in the electromagnetic radiation field is expressed in the form\ndp~\u2032\nd\u03c4\ndE \u2032\nd\u03c4\n\n=\n\n1 \u2032\nS\nc\n\n=\n\n0,\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u02c6\u2032\n\u2032 ~\nC Si\n(1)\n\nin the proper frame of the particle; S \u2032 is the flux density of the radiation energy, C \u2032 is pressure cross section 3\n\u02c6\n\u00d7 3 matrix, S~i\u2032 is unit vector of the incident radiation, \u03c4 is proper time, c is the speed of light.\nWe are interested in deriving equation of motion of the particle in the rest frame of the source: the particle\n\u02c6\nmoves with instantaneous velocity ~v with respect to the source, the unit vector of the incident radiation is S~i\nand other physical quantities measured in the rest frame of the source are also unprimed.\n3. Reformulation of the initial equation of motion\nLet the components of the pressure cross section C \u2032 3 \u00d7 3 matrix are given in a basis of orthonormal vectors\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\ne~\u2032b1 , e~\u2032b2 , e~\u2032b3 .\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\nLet us define a new orthonormal basis of vectors S~i\u2032 , e~\u20321 , e~\u20322 .

Covariant form of equation of motion\nComparison of our Eq. (6) with Eq. (7) in Kla\u010dka (2000a) enables immediately write covariant form of equation\nof motion, on the basis of Eq.

Conclusion\nWe have obtained covariant equation of motion for the particle moving in electromagnetic radiation field.\n\nWe have supposed that interaction between the particle and electromagnetic radiation is described by radiation\npressure cross section C \u2032 3 \u00d7 3 matrix. Simple transformations reduce this mathematical form of description\nto that presented in Kla\u010dka (2000a). This has enabled to write final Eq. (7).\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the VEGA grant No.1/7067/20.\n\nReferences\nKla\u010dka J., 1994, Earth, Moon, and Planets 64, 125-132.\nKla\u010dka J., 2000a, http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0008510.\nKla\u010dka J., 2000b, http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0009108.\nKla\u010dka J., 2000c, http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0009109.\nKla\u010dka J., Kocifaj M., 2001, JQSRT 70/4-6, 595-610.\nRobertson, H.
