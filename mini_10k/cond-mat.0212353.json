In such systems zeroenergy states6,7 (ZES) formed at interfaces affect crucially the transport properties through junctions. In\nnormal-metal / high-Tc superconductor8 junctions, for\ninstance, a large peak due to the ZES is observed in\nthe conductance at the zero-bias voltage 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 .\nThe resonant tunneling via the ZES enhances the Andreev reflection16 , which leads to the low-temperature\nanomaly in the Josephson current, e.g. between two\nd-wave superconductors 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 . The lowtemperature anomaly in the Josephson current is a rather\ncommon phenomenon for unconventional superconductors including those with spin-triplet pairing25 . The possibility of a logarithmic temperature dependence of the\ncritical Josephson current was also predicted for junctions between two SRO samples26,27,28 .\nThe Josephson current-phase relation can be decomposed into a series of contributions of different order\nJ=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(Jn sin n\u03c6 + In cos n\u03c6) ,\n\n(1)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the phase-difference across junctions. The\ncoefficients In vanish for all n as long as time reversal\nsymmetry is conserved, since in this case \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6 implies J \u2192 \u2212J. As we will deal in the following with a\nsuperconducting phase which break time reversal symmetry, we will keep these terms. In the most simple ap-\n\nproach, the lowest order contribution J1 vanishes, for a\njunction of the composition spin-singlet superconductor /\ninsulator / spin-triplet superconductor29,30,31,32,33,34 , because the wave function of the two superconducting condensates are in orbital and spin part orthogonal to each\nother. In this case the second order contribution with\nthe Josephson current proportional to sin 2\u03c6 is leading.\nThe presence of spin-flip scattering and the breaking of\nparity at the interface between different materials, would\ninvalidate this simple-minded argumentation. A magnetically active interface yielding spin-flip contributions occurs in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Obviously,\nspin-orbit coupling yields new selection rules, because\nspin and orbital \"angular momentum\" need not to be\nconserved independently, but rather only the \"total angular momentum\" has to remain unchanged in the tunneling process. Then lowest order coupling, J1 and/or I1 ,\ncan be finite25,29,30,34 , so that spin-orbit coupling modifies the current-phase relation of the Josephson effect between singlet and triplet superconductors qualitatively.\nIn this paper we study the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the Josephson effect for the example of\nthe chiral p-wave state which is most likely realized\nin SRO35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50 .This state\nbreaks time reversal symmetry with an angular momentum along the c-axis and has inplane equal spin pairing36 .\nSo far the transport properties in junctions consisting of\nSRO and s-wave superconductors or normal metals have\nbeen studied in both theories 51,52,53,54,55,56 and experiments57,58,59,60 . The effect of spin-orbit coupling, where\nit had been taken into account, was introduced in form\nof effective matrix elements only without the care of a\ndetailed microscopic model for their origin. Here we will\nconsider a model which explicitly introduces spin-orbit\ncoupling as an interface effect and allows us to study\n\n\f2\nthe symmetry related issues of the interface by direct\nvariation of coupling parameters. Our model ignores the\nspin-orbit coupling effects in the bulk of the two superconductors for the reason that details of the ionic lattice\nand the band structure would play an essential role, both\nof which are not easy to implement in a simple model of\nan unconventional superconductor. Furthermore, we aim\nhere also at effects of the ZES on the Josephson current\nin connection with the spin-orbit coupling.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec II, we explain\na theoretical model. The Josephson current is derived in\nSec. III. The conclusion is given in Sec.

In Fig. 2 (a), we\nshow the Josephson current as a function of \u03c6, where\n\u03b4\u03bc = 0, kF L = 0 and the integration with respect to \u03b8 in\nEq. (47) is carried out numerically. For simplicity we assume \u2206s = \u2206p and describe the temperature dependence\nof the pair potential by using the BCS theory. The pair\npotential at T = 0 is denoted by \u22060 . In this case, gJ = 1\nand there is no spin-orbit scattering at the junctions. The\nJosephson current is proportional to sin 2\u03c6 for high temperatures such as T /Tc = 0.2 \u223c 0.8 in (a). In a very low\ntemperature, T /Tc = 0.01 proportional to sin 4\u03c6 slightly\nmodifies the phase-current relationship. The maximum\namplitude of the Josephson current increases monotonically with decreasing temperatures as shown in Fig. 2\n(b).\nSince electronic structures in s-wave superconductor\nare different from those in SRO, complete transparency\nof the interface is unrealistic for real junctions. Moreover, we consider an insulating layer between the two\nsuperconductors. The calculated results are shown in\nFig. 3, where V\u03040 = 5.0, kF L = 0.6.

A similar behavior can be found in Josephson\neffects in SRO/I/SRO junctions, where the two superconductors are belonging to the different chirality26,27 .\nThe energy of the junction can be calculated from\nthe current-phase relationship by using a relation J =\ne\u2202\u03c6 E(\u03c6). In Fig. 5, we schematically illustrate the energy\nas a function of \u03c6. When the contribution of the spinorbit scattering is negligible, there are two energy minima\nat \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03c0/2 as shown with the solid line. These bistable\nstates may be used as a base of the quantum computing\ndevices63 . The spin-orbit scattering breaks the bistability\nas shown with the broken line, where energy at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2\nis slightly smaller than that at \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0/2. The energy\nminima do not shift away from \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03c0/2 even in the\npresence of the spin-orbit scattering. Thus, in the absence of the Josephson current, the phase-difference of\njunction is considerd to be either \u03c0/2 or \u2212\u03c0/2. In experiments, the effects of the spin-orbit scattering may\nbe measured from the difference in the critical Josephson current starting from two different energy minima.\nAn alternative method to confirm the effects of the spinorbit scattering is the measurement of the Shapiro step\nin I-V curve. It is also possible to observe directly the\nphase-current relationship23 .\n\nThe left hand side of Eq. (51) is 0.007 in Fig. 3 and 1.1\nin Fig. 4. To compare with experiments, Eq. (51) should\nbe put in another way,\nJc\n\u2264 \u03b1s \u223c 10\u22123 ,\n(\u03c0\u22060 /2eRJ )\n\n(52)\n\nwhere Jc is the critical Josephson current. In addition to\nthis, the first term becomes more dominant at temperatures close to Tc as shown in Fig. (4) (a). In this junction,\nthere are ZES states. However, there is no anomalous behavior of the Josephson current even in low temperatures\nas shown in Fig. (4) (b). As we see shortly this aspect\ncan be attributed to the fact, that it is the py (the transverse component of the pair wave function) which yields\nthe coupling to the s-wave superconductor through spinorbit scattering. According to Eq.(25), however, only the\npx -component generates the ZES, which couples in higher\n\nEnergy of Junction [\n\np\nwhere TN \u223c X/z0 because of z0 \u223c V\u030402 exp(2 V\u03040 LkF ) \u226b\nX. The first term is coming from the spin-orbit scattering and is proportional to cos \u03c6. In Eq.(1), J1 and I1 are\nproportional to TN , therefore they are proportional to gJ\nbecause a quasiparticle travels twice across the junction\nto contribute to J1 or I1 . A quasiparticle goes across the\nbarrier four times to contribute to the Josephson current\nproportional to sin 2\u03c6. Thus the second term of Eq. (50)\nis proportional to TN2 . Generally speaking, Jn and In are\nproportional to TNn and gJn .

Lichtenberg, Nature 372, 532\n\nFinally we summarize the results in this paper. We\ncalculated the Josephson current in s-wave superconductor / SRO by assuming the pair potential in Eq. (23) and\ncompare the results with another pairing symmetries as\nshown in Eqs. (53) and (54). When the triplet superconductors are described by px -wave symmetry, we find the\nlow-temperature anomaly in the Josephson current because the ZES are formed at the interface. We also find in\npx -wave symmetry that effects of the spin-orbit scattering\non the Josephson current are absent. It is obvious that\nspin-orbit coupling is associated with the transverse component py , which does not induce a ZES at the interface\nand consequently does not display the anomalous lowtemperature behavior of the maximal Josephson current.\nThus, the current-phase relation of the junction is connected with the order parameter phase of the transverse\ncomponent. This in the case of Eq. (54) \u03c6p and \u03c6p + \u03c0/2\nfor Eq. (23), since for the latter the py -component is multiplied by i in our definition. This finding of the coupling\nis entirely in agreement with the qualitative statements of\nprevious discussions of the Josephson effect of this kind,\nmediated via spin-orbit coupling29,30,31,32,33,34 . Furthermore, from Eqs.(50,56) we can conclude, that beyond\nthe finite spin-orbit coupling represented by the coupling\nconstant \u03b1s also the broken parity at the interface, i.e.\n\u03b4\u03bc 6= 0 is essential for a finite contribution through this\nchannel.\n\n2\n\n(1994).\nS.
