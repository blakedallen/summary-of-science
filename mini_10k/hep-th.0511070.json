Introduction\nAn important dynamical mechanism, by which fundamental particles acquire masses, is\nthrough interactions with vacuum condensates. Thus, a massive particle may carve out\naround itself a spherical region [1] or a shell [2] in which the condensate is suppressed,\nthus reducing the effective mass of the particle at the expense of volume and gradient\nenergy associated with the condensate. This picture has interesting phenomenological\nconsequences [1, 3].\nThis dynamical distortion of the homogeneous vacuum condensate configuration,\nnamely, formation of fermion bag solitons, was demonstrated explicitly by Dashen,\nHasslacher and Neveu (DHN) [4] many years ago, who studied semiclassical bound\nstates in the 1 + 1 dimensional Gross-Neveu (GN) model [5], using the inverse scattering\nmethod [6]. Following DHN, Shei [7] has applied the inverse scattering method to study\nsolitons in the 1 + 1 dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [8] in the large-N\nlimit.\nFermion bags in the GN model were discussed in the literature several other times\nsince the work of DHN, using alternative methods [9, 10, 11]. For a review on these and\nrelated matters (with an emphasis on the relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation) see\n[12]. For a more recent review of static fermion bags in the GN model (with an emphasis\non reflectionless backgrounds and supersymmetric quantum mechanics) see [13]. The\n\n\fFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\n2\n\nlarge-N semiclassical DHN spectrum of these fermion bags turns out to be essentially\ncorrect also for finite N, as analysis of the exact factorizable S-matrix of the GN model\nreveals [14].\nA variational calculation of these effects in the 1 + 1 dimensional massive\ngeneralization of the Gross-Neveu model, which we will refer to as MGN, was carried in\n[15] a few years ago, and more recently in [16]. Very recently, we studied static fermion\nbags in the MGN model [17], which we obtained using the inverse-scattering formalism,\nthus avoiding the need to choose a trial variational field configuration. Our main result\nin [17] is that the extremal static bag configurations are reflectionless, as in the massless\nGross-Neveu model. In the next section we briefly review the results of [17], leaving\ntechnical details out. Then, in Section 3, we show that a subclass of the reflectionless\nsolitons of [17] arise self-consistently in the 1 + 1 dimensional massive NJL (MNJL)\nmodel. The latter extends the results of [7, 18] for the massless NJL model. Solitons in\nthe MNJL model were also recently studied in [16], where a derivative expansion was\ncarried out around a particular soliton background of the corresponding massless NJL\nmodel.\n2. Solitons in the Massive Gross-Neveu Model\nOne way of writing the action for the MGN model is\n)\n(N\nZ\nX\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n,\nS = d2 x\n\u03c8\u0304a i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c8a \u2212 2 \u03c3 2 \u2212 2M\u03c3\n2g\na=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the \u03c8a (a = 1, . . . , N,) are massive Dirac fermions and \u03c3 is an auxiliary field.\nIntegrating the \u03c3 out results in an equivalent form of (1), with quartic fermion selfinteractions.\nAn obvious symmetry of (1) with its N Dirac spinors is U(N). Actually, (1) is\nsymmetric under the larger group O(2N) [4] (see also Section 1 of [13]). The fact that\nthe symmetry group of (1) is O(2N) rather than U(N) is related to the fact that it is\ninvariant against charge-conjugation, like the massless GN model. Consequently, the\nenergy eigenvalues of the Dirac equation associated with (1), [i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3(x)] \u03c8 = 0, come in\n\u00b1\u03c9 pairs.\nAs usual, the theory (1) can be rewritten with the help of the scalar flavor singlet\nauxiliary field \u03c3(x). Also as usual, we take the large N limit holding \u03bb \u2261 Ng 2 fixed.\nIntegrating out the fermions, we obtain the bare effective action\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nd2 x \u03c3 2 \u2212 2M\u03c3 \u2212 iN Tr log i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3 .\n(2)\nS[\u03c3] = \u2212 2\n2g\n\nNoting that \u03b35 (i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3) = \u2212(i\u2202/ + \u03c3)\u03b35 , we can rewrite the Tr log(i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3) as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nTr log \u2212(i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3)(i\u2202/ + \u03c3) . In this paper we focus on static soliton configurations. If \u03c3\n2\nR\n[Tr log(h+ \u2212\nis time independent, the latter expression may be further simplified to T2 d\u03c9\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2032\n\u03c9 ) + Tr log(h\u2212 \u2212 \u03c9 )] where h\u00b1 \u2261 \u2212\u2202x + \u03c3 \u00b1 \u03c3 , and where T is an infra-red\n\n\f3\n\nFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\ntemporal regulator. As it turns out, the two Schr\u00f6dinger operators h\u00b1 are isospectral\n(see Appendix A of [13] and Section 2 of [11]) and thus we obtain\nZ\nZ\u221e\n\u0001\nd\u03c9\n1\nd2 x \u03c3 2 \u2212 2M\u03c3 \u2212 iNT\nTr log(h\u2212 \u2212 \u03c9 2 ) .\n(3)\nS[\u03c3] = \u2212 2\n2g\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIn contrast to the standard massless GN model, the MGN model studied here is not\ninvariant under the Z2 symmetry \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b35 \u03c8, \u03c3 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3, and the physics is correspondingly\nquite different. As a result of the Z2 degeneracy of its vacuum, the GN model contains\na soliton (the so called CCGZ kink [19, 4, 9, 11, 13]) in which the \u03c3 field takes on equal\nand opposite values at x = \u00b1\u221e. The stability of this soliton is obviously guaranteed by\ntopological considerations. With any non-zero M the vacuum value of \u03c3 is unique and\nthe CCGZ kink becomes infinitely massive and disappears. If any soliton exists at all,\nits stability has to depend on the energetics of trapping fermions.\nLet us briefly recall the computation of the unique vacuum of the MGN model.\nWe shall follow [15]. For an earlier analysis of the MGN ground state (as well as its\nthermodynamics), see [20]. Setting \u03c3 to a constant we obtain\nh 2from (3) the\ni renormalized\n2\n2\n\u03c3\n1\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nlog e\u03bc\n\u2212 M(\u03bc)\u03c3 , where \u03bc is a\neffective potential (per flavor) V (\u03c3, \u03bc) = 4\u03c0\n2 + \u03bb(\u03bc)\n2\n\nsliding renormalization scale with \u03bb(\u03bc) = Ng 2 (\u03bc) and M(\u03bc) the running couplings. By\nequating the coefficient of \u03c3 2 in two versions of V , one defined with \u03bc1 and the other\nwith \u03bc2 , we find immediately that \u03bb(\u03bc1 1 ) \u2212 \u03bb(\u03bc1 2 ) = \u03c01 log \u03bc\u03bc21 and thus the coupling \u03bb is\nasymptotically free, just as in the GN model. Furthermore, by equating the coefficient\n(\u03bc)\nof \u03c3 in V we see that the ratio M\nis a renormalization group invariant. Thus, M and\n\u03bb(\u03bc)\n\u03bb have the same scale dependence.\nWithout loss of generality we assume that M(\u03bc) > 0 and thus the absolute\nminimum of V (\u03c3, \u03bc), namely, the vacuum condensate hm = h\u03c3i, is the\ni unique (and\n(\u03bc)\ndV\n1\nm\n1\n= m \u03c0 log \u03bc + \u03bb(\u03bc) \u2212 M\n= 0.\npositive) solution of the gap equation d\u03c3\n\u03bb(\u03bc)\n\u03c3=m\n\nReferring to (1), we see that m is the mass of the fermion. Using the explicit scale\n(\u03bc)\nm\ndependence of \u03bb(\u03bc), we can re-write the gap equation as \u03bb(m)\n= M\n, which shows\n\u03bb(\u03bc)\nmanifestly that m, an observable physical quantity, is a renormalization group invariant.\nThis equation also implies that M(m) = m, which makes sense physically.\nFermion bags correspond to inhomogeneous solutions of the saddle-point equation\n\u03b4S\n= 0. In particular, static bags \u03c3(x) are the extremal configurations of the energy\n\u03b4\u03c3(x,t)\n\n, subjected to the boundary condition that\nfunctional (per flavor) E[\u03c3(x)] = \u2212 S[\u03c3(x)]\nNT\n\u03c3(x) relaxes to its unique vacuum expectation value m at x = \u00b1\u221e. More specifically,\nwe have to evaluate the energy functional of a static configuration \u03c3(x), obeying the\nappropriate boundary conditions at spatial infinity, which supports K pairs of bound\nstates of the Dirac equation at energies \u00b1\u03c9n , n = 1, . . . , K (where, of course, \u03c9n2 < m2 ).\nThe bound states at \u00b1\u03c9n are to be considered together, due to the charge conjugation\ninvariance of the GN model. Due to Pauli's exclusion principle, we can populate each\nof the bound states \u00b1\u03c9n with up to N fermions. In such a typical multiparticle state,\nthe negative frequency state is populated by N \u2212 hn fermions (i.e., by hn holes or\n\n\fFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\n4\n\nantiparticles) and the positive frequency state contains pn fermions (or particles). We\nshall refer to the total number of particles and antiparticles trapped in the n-th pair of\nbound states \u03bdn = pn + hn as the valence, or occupation number of that pair.\nThe energy functional E[\u03c3(x)] is, in principle, a complicated and generally unknown\nfunctional of \u03c3(x) and of its derivatives (which furthermore, requires regularization).\n\u03b4E[\u03c3]\n= 0, as a functional equation for \u03c3(x), seems\nThus, the extremum condition \u03b4\u03c3(x)\nintractable. The considerable complexity of the functional equations that determine the\nextremal \u03c3(x) configurations is the source of all difficulties that arise in any attempt to\nsolve the model under consideration. DHN found a way around this difficulty in the case\nof the GN model [4]. They have used inverse scattering techniques [6] to express the\n(regulated) energy functional E[\u03c3] in terms of the so-called \"scattering data\" associated\nwith, e.g., the hamiltonian h\u2212 mentioned above (and thus with \u03c3(x)), and then solved\n\u03b4E[\u03c3]\n= 0 with respect to those data.\nthe extremum condition \u03b4\u03c3(x)\nThe scattering data associated with h\u2212 are [6] the reflection amplitude r(k) of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger operator h\u2212 at momentum k, the number K of bound states in h\u2212 and their\ncorresponding energies 0 < \u03c9n2 \u2264 m2 , (n = 1, . . . , K), and also additional K parameters\n{cn }, where cn has to do with the normalization of the nth bound state wave function \u03c8n\n2\nof h\u2212 . More precisely, the nth bound state wave function,\npwith energy \u03c9n , must decay\nas \u03c8n (x) \u223c const. exp \u2212\u03ban x as x \u2192 \u221e, where 0 < \u03ban = m2 \u2212 \u03c9n2 . If we impose that\n\u03c8n (x) be normalized, this will determine the constant coefficient as cn . (With no loss\nof generality, we may take cn > 0.) Recall that r(\u2212k) = r \u2217 (k), since the Schr\u00f6dinger\npotential V (x) = \u03c3 2 (x) \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 (x) is real. Thus, only the values of r(k) for k > 0 enter\nthe scattering data. The scattering data are independent variables, which determine\nV (x) uniquely, assuming V (x) belongs to a certain class of potentials which fall-off fast\nenough toward infinity. (Since the MGN does not bear topological solitons, neither h\u2212\nnor h+ can have a normalizable zero energy eigenstate. Thus, all the \u03c9n are strictly\npositive.)\nWe can apply directly the results of DHN in order to write down that part of E[\u03c3(x)]\nwhich is common to the MGN and GN models, i.e., E[\u03c3(x)] with its term proportional to\nM removed, in terms of the scattering data. For lack of space we shall not write DHN's\nexpression for the energy functional explicitly. Suffice it is to mention at this point that\nthe \"DHN-part\" of E[\u03c3(x)] depends on the reflection amplitude only via certain regular\ndispersion integrals of the quantity log[1 \u2212 |r(k)|2]. The well-known reflectionless nature\nof solitons in the GN model is a direct consequence of this simple fact.\nIn order to complete the task of expressing the effective action of the MGN model in\nterms of the scattering data, we have to find such a representation for the remaining piece\nR\u221e\n(\u03c3(x) \u2212 m) dx. The latter integral\nof E[\u03c3(x)] proportional to M, namely, for \u2212 M\n\u03bb \u2212\u221e\ncannot be expressed in terms of the scattering data based on the trace identities of\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger operator h\u2212 discussed in Appendix B of [4]. Evidently, new analysis is\nrequired to obtain its representation in terms of the scattering data. Happily enough,\n\n\fFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\n5\n\nwe were able to obtain such a representation in [17], which reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\u221e\nZ\u221e\nK\nX\nlog [1 \u2212 |r(k)|2]\nm \u2212 \u03ban\n1\n.(4)\ndk +\nlog\n(\u03c3(x) \u2212 m) dx =\n2\u03c0i\nim \u2212 k\nm + \u03ban\nn=1\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThus, the M-dependent part of E[\u03c3(x)], like its \"DHN-part\", depends on the reflection\namplitude only via the combination log[1\u2212|r(k)|2 ]. Combining these two terms together,\nit follows that \u03b4E reg [\u03c3(x)]/\u03b4r(k) = F (k) r \u2217 (k)/(1 \u2212 |r(k)|2 ), where F (k) is a calculable\nfunction, which does not vanish identically. Thus, r(k) \u2261 0 is the unique solution of the\nvariational equation \u03b4E reg [\u03c3(x)]/\u03b4r(k) = 0. Static extremal bags in the MGN model are\nreflectionless, as their counterparts in the GN model.\nExplicit formulas for reflectionless \u03c3(x) configurations with an arbitrary number\nK of pairs of bound states are displayed in Appendix B of [13]. Inpparticular, the one\nwhich supports a single pair of bound states at energies \u00b1\u03c9b (\u03ba = m2 \u2212 \u03c9b2 ), the one\noriginally discovered by DHN, is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1\nm+\u03ba\nm+\u03ba\n1\n\u2212 tanh \u03bax + log\n.(5)\n\u03c3(x) = m+\u03ba tanh \u03bax \u2212 log\n4\nm\u2212\u03ba\n4\nm\u2212\u03ba\n\nWe see that the formidable problem of finding the extremal \u03c3(x) configurations of\nthe energy functional E[\u03c3] is reduced to the simpler problem of extremizing an ordinary\nfunction E(\u03c9n , cn ) = E [\u03c3(x; \u03c9n , cn )] with respect to the 2K parameters {cn , \u03c9n } that\ndetermine the reflectionless background \u03c3(x). If we solve this ordinary extremum\nproblem, we will be able to calculate the mass of the fermion bag. This we did in\ndetail in [17]. Let us sketch the procedure and state the final result:\nThe bare regulated energy function E(\u03c9n ) which depends on the bare couplings \u03bb\nand M and on the UV-cutoff \u039b explicitly can be renormalized, in a manner essentially\nsimilar to the effective potential, as was described above. E is independent of the cn 's,\nwhich appear in the scattering data. (The latter are thus flat directions for the energy\nfunction and determine the collective coordinates of the soliton.) The renormalized\nP\nenergy function thus obtained is a sum of the form K\nn=1 f (\u03c9n , \u03bdn ) where f (\u03c9, \u03bd) is a\nknown function, which depends also on the physical mass m explicitly, and also through\nM (\u03bc)\n1\n= m\u03bb(\u03bc)\n. Thus, the extremum condition fixes each \u03c9n\nthe RG-invariant ratio \u03b3 = \u03bb(m)\nin terms of the number of the total number \u03bdn of particles and holes trapped in the\nbound states of the Dirac equation at \u00b1\u03c9n , and not by the numbers of trapped particles\nand holes separately (see (6)). This fact is a manifestation of the underlying O(2N)\nsymmetry, which treats particles and holes symmetrically. Moreover, it indicates [17]\nthat this pair of bound states gives rise to an O(2N) antisymmetric tensor multiplet of\nrank \u03bdn of soliton states. (As it turns out, only tensors of ranks 0 < \u03bdn < N correspond\nto viable solitons [17].) The soliton as a whole is therefore the tensor product of all these\nantisymmetric tensor multiplets. Finally, we showed in [17] that only the irreducible\n(K = 1) soliton was protected by energy conservation and O(2N) symmetry against\ndecaying into lighter solitons (or free massive fermions). Its profile is given by (5),\nwhere \u03ba = m sin \u03b8 (or, equivalently, \u03c9 = m cos \u03b8), with 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, and where \u03b8 is\n\n\fFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\n6\n\ndetermined by the extremum condition\n\u03bd\n\u03b8\n+ \u03b3 tan \u03b8 =\n.\n(6)\n\u03c0\n2N\nThe left-hand side of (6) is a monotonically increasing function. Therefore, (6) has a\n\u03c0\u03bd\n,\nunique solution in the interval [0, \u03c0/2]. This solution is evidently smaller than \u03b8GN = 2N\nthe corresponding value of \u03b8 in the GN model for the same occupation number. Thus,\nthe corresponding bound state energy \u03c9 = m cos \u03b8 in the MGN model is higher than its\nGN counterpart, and thus less bound. The soliton mass (i.e., the renormalized energy\nfunction, evaluated at the solution of (6)) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n1 + sin \u03b8\nM(\u03bd) = Nm\n.\n(7)\nsin \u03b8 + \u03b3 log\n\u03c0\n1 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nThis coincide with the corresponding results of variational calculations presented in\n[15, 16], which were based on (5) as a trial configuration. In fact, it was realized in [16]\n\u03b4E[\u03c3]\n= 0,\nthat the trial configuration (5) is an exact solution of the extremum condition \u03b4\u03c3(x)\nprovided (6) is used to fix \u03ba = m sin \u03b8.\n3. Reflectionless solitons in the Massive Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model\nIt is natural to inquire whether the results of the previous section carry over to the phenomenologically interesting MNJL model.\nThe action for the MNJL model may be writo\n\u0002\n\u0003\nR 2 nPN\n1\n2\n2\n/\n,\nten as a generalization of (1), S = d x\na=1 \u03c8\u0304a i\u2202 \u2212 (\u03c3 + i\u03c0\u03b35 ) \u03c8a \u2212 2g 2 (\u03c3 + \u03c0 \u2212 2M\u03c3)\nwhere \u03c0(x) is a pseudo-scalar auxiliary field. (Here we assumed that the 2 \u00d7 2 chiral\nmass matrix does not have a pseudo-scalar component, but this does not restrict the\ngenerality of our discussion in any way. This particular orientation of the mass matrix\ncan be always reached at by performing a global - and therefore, anomaly free- chiral\nrotation in the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c0 plane.)\nAs in our discussion of the MGN model, we can integrate out the fermions, and\nobtain the bare effective action\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nd2 x \u03c3 2 + \u03c0 2 \u2212 2M\u03c3 \u2212 iN Tr log i\u2202/ \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b35 . (8)\nS[\u03c3] = \u2212 2\n2g\nAs before, we take the large N limit, holding \u03bb \u2261 Ng 2 fixed. Unlike the NJL model,\nwith its continuum of degenerate vacua, the ground state of the MNJL model (8) is\nunique, as in the MGN model. It corresponds to a constant field configuration, where\n\u03c0 = 0 and where \u03c3 = m is determined by an equation identical to the one which arises\nin the MGN model.\nShei [7] has studied static solitons in the NJL model (i.e., M = 0 in (8)) using\ninverse scattering techniques. Similarly to DHN's results for the GN model, he concluded\nthat extremal soliton profiles are reflectionless. Some of his results were rederived in\n[18], using a certain method based on properties of the diagonal resolvent of the Dirac\noperator, (which was applied first to the GN model in [11]).\nCould Shei's analysis be extended to study solitons in the MNJL model, similarly to\nthe extension of DHN's inverse scattering analysis to the MGN model? Could it be that\n\n\f7\n\nFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\nthe self-consistent static soliton backgrounds in the MNJL model are reflectionless?\nIt seems that all we need in order to answer these questions is a generalization of\n(4) to the case in which the Dirac operator involves a pseudo-scalar background \u03c0(x).\nUnfortunately, we were not able (so-far) to find such a generalization, and therefore we\ncannot answer these questions in general at the moment. However, we were able to find\na particular family of self-consistent reflectionless static solitons in the MNJL model by\nmaking an educated guess, as we shall now explain.\nThe spectrum of the Dirac equation associated with (8) is not invariant against\ncharge-conjugation, unless \u03c0(x) \u2261 0. Thus, the bound states corresponding to a static\nsoliton background are not paired, in general. In particular, as has been shown by Shei,\nthere exist solitons in the NJL model which bind fermions into a single bound state.\nHowever, he has also found solitons with charge-conjugation-invariant spectrum (see\nEqs.(3.25)-(3.28) in [7]), with a pair of bound states \u00b1\u03c9b , in which \u03c0(x) = 0 identically,\nand \u03c3(x) is given by (5), which thus coincide with the DHN solitons in the GN model,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0\u03bd\n\u03c0\u03bd\nand MDHN (\u03bd) = 2N\u03c0m sin 2N\n. However, unlike in the GN\nfor which \u03c9b = m cos 2N\n\u03bd\nmodel, in the NJL model we must choose p = h = 2 (i.e., a soliton of this type must\ntrap an equal number of fermions and anti-fermions). The reason for this restriction is\nnot hard to understand physically: the total chiral rotation \u2206\u03b8, namely, the difference\n\u03c0(x)\nbetween the two ends of the one dimensional space, must be related to the\nin arctan \u03c3(x)\n2\u03c0n\n\nfermion number charge nf deposited in the soliton according to \u2206\u03b8 = \u2212 N f [21] (see\nalso Eqs. (5.10) and (5.22) in [18]). The soliton profile (\u03c3(x), \u03c0(x)) under consideration,\nstarts at the vacuum point (m, 0) at x = \u2212\u221e and returns to it at x = +\u221e. Thus,\n\u2206\u03b8 = nf = p \u2212 h = 0 for this soliton.\nNow, any static soliton profile in the MNJL model must start at the unique\nvacuum (m, 0) at x = \u2212\u221e and return to it at x = +\u221e. Thus, it should bring about\nnull total chiral rotation, precisely as Shei's charge-conjugation-invariant configuration\ndoes. Therefore, if the MNJL bears reflectionless static solitons, they must be of this\nform (or charge-conjugate invariant generalizations thereof, with more pairs of paired\nbound states). The only thing that should change compared to the NJL model is the\nquantization condition, relating \u03c9b and \u03bd.\nWe have verified that this is indeed the case, simply by substituting this\nconfiguration into the static inhomogeneous saddle-point equations associated with (8).\nVarying (8) with respect to \u03c0(x) we obviously obtain an equation identical in form to\nthat of the NJL model. (For the latter, see the second equation in (5.1) in [18]). Using\nthe explicit expressions for the entries of the diagonal resolvent of the Dirac operator\nwith a reflectionless (\u03c3(x), \u03c0(x)) background with two bound states (Eqs. (4.13) and\n(4.14) in [18] with paired bound states \u03c92 = \u2212\u03c91 ), we see that \u03c0(x) \u2261 0 is indeed a\nsolution of that equation. (Here, having p = h = \u03bd2 is essential.). This \u03c0-equation\nleaves \u03c91 an undetermined function of \u03bd. We still have to vary with respect to \u03c3(x).\nSubstituting the explicit expressions for the appropriate entries of the diagonal resolvent\nof the Dirac operator (Eqs.(4.13), (4.14) and (2.10) of [18]) in the saddle-point equation\narising from variation with respect to \u03c3(x), and using the simplifying identity Eq. (2.24)\n\n\fFermion Bag Solitons: Inverse Scattering Analysis\n\n8\n\nof [22], we arrive simply at the static saddle-point equation of the MGN model, which is\nsolved by \u03c3(x) given by (5) and the quantization condition (6), leading to soliton mass\n(7). Thus, a restricted subset of the extremal reflectionless solitons of the MGN model\nappear, not surprisingly, also in the MNJL model. For these solitons \u03c0(x) \u2261 0. The\nquestion whether these solitons exhaust all possibilities in the two-dimensional MNJL\nmodel remains open.\nReferences\n[1] T. D. Lee and G. Wick, Phys. Rev. D 9, 2291 (1974); R. Friedberg, T.D.
