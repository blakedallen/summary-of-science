E-mail: slavnov@goa.bog.msu.ru\nAbstract\nWe show that the principles of a \"complete physical theory\" and the conclusions of the\nstandard quantum mechanics do not irreconcilably contradict each other as is commonly\nbelieved. In the algebraic approach, we formulate axioms that allow constructing a renewed\nmathematical scheme of quantum mechanics. This scheme involves the standard mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Simultaneously, it contains a mathematical object\nthat adequately describes a single experiment. We give an example of the application of the\nproposed scheme.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the seminal work by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen [1], the main principles were formulated\nthat must be satisfied by a complete physical theory in the authors' opinion:\na. \"each element of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory\" and\nb. \"if we can confidently (i.e., with the probability one) predict the value of some physical\nquantity without perturbing the system in any way, then there exists an element of the physical\nreality corresponding to this physical quantity.\"\nThe standard quantum mechanics (the theory traced back to Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac, and\nvon Neumann) did not accept this maxim. A single experiment has no adequate counterpart\nin the mathematical formalism of the standard quantum mechanics. Moreover, the belief was\nfirmly established that such a counterpart cannot exist.\nIn this work, we attempt to formulate the basic points of a mathematical scheme of quantum\nmechanics satisfying two seemingly incompatible requirements. First, the standard mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics can be reproduced within this scheme. Second, this scheme\ninvolves a mathematical object that adequately describes a single experiment.\nMost of these points are formulated in [2]. We clarify and extend them here. In particular,\nwe essentially clarify the role of the measuring device. In this work, in variation with [2], greater\nattention is paid to mathematical aspects of the theory. A more detailed phenomenological\njustification of the axioms and the relations of the proposed approach to other versions of the\ntheory can be found in [2].\n\n2\n\nObservables and physical states\n\nThe proposal is to construct the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on the\nalgebraic approach to quantum theory [3], where observable quantities correspond to elements\nof some algebra. The main points of this algebraic approach can be formulated more simply if\nin addition to the directly observable quantities, their complex combinations are also included\n1\n\n\fin the consideration. These combinations are called dynamic quantities in what follows. We\naccept the following statement as the first postulate.\nElements of an involutive, associative, and (in general) noncommutative algebra A correspond to dynamic variables such that the following conditions are satisfied:\na. for each element R\u0302 \u2208 A, there exists a Hermitian element \u00c2 (\u00c2\u2217 = \u00c2) such that R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302 =\n2\n\u00c2 , and\nb. if R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302 = 0, then R\u0302 = 0.\nWe assume that the algebra has a unit element I\u02c6 and that Hermitian elements of A correspond to observable quantities. We let A+ denote the set of these elements.\nWe now formulate the second postulate.\nMutually commuting elements of the set A+ correspond to compatible (simultaneously measurable) observables.\nA specific feature of compatible observables is then that they allow a system of measuring devices whereby these observables can be repeatedly measured in an arbitrary sequence.\nThe results of a repeated measurement of observables are then unchanged. We say that the\ncorresponding measurements are reproducible.\nWe let Q\u03be (Q \u2261 {Q\u0302} \u2208 A+ ) denote the maximal real commutative subalgebra of the algebra A. This is the subalgebra of compatible observables. The subscript \u03be (\u03be \u2208 \u039e) distinguishes\ndifferent such subalgebras. If A is commutative (the algebra of classical dynamic variables), then\nthe set \u039e consists of one element. If A is noncommutative (the algebra of quantum dynamic\nvariables), then the set \u039e has the power of the continuum.\nHermitian elements of A are a latent form of observable quantities. The explicit form is\na certain number, which transpires in an individual observation. We assume that there exists\nsome physical reality that determines the result of such an individual observation. We call this\nphysical reality the physical state of the quantum object.\nIn what follows, we need the following definition [4]. Let B be a real (complex) commutative\nalgebra and \u03c6\u0303 be a linear functional on B. If\n\u03c6\u0303(B\u03021 B\u03022 ) = \u03c6\u0303(B\u03021 )\u03c6\u0303(B\u03022 ) for all B\u03021 \u2208 B and B\u03022 \u2208 B,\nthen the functional \u03c6\u0303 is called the real (complex) homomorphism on the algebra B.\nWe now formulate the third postulate.\nThe physical state of a quantum object involved in an individual observation is described by\na functional \u03c6(\u00c2) (in general, multivalued), with (\u00c2 \u2208 A+ ), whose restriction \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) to each\nsubalgebra Q\u03be is single-valued and is a real homomorphism (\u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) = A is a real number).\nA functional \u03c6 is multivalued because the result of an observation can depend not only on the\nquantum object under observation but also on properties of the device used for the observation.\nA typical measuring device consists of an analyzer and a detector. The analyzer is a device with\none input and several output channels. As an example, we consider the device measuring an\nobservable \u00c2. For simplicity, we assume that the spectrum of this observable is discrete. Each\noutput channel of the analyzer must then correspond to a certain point of the spectrum. The\ndetector registers the output channel through which the quantum object leaves the analyzer.\nThe corresponding point of the spectrum is taken to be the value of the observable \u00c2 registered\nby the measuring device.\nIn general, the value not of one observable \u00c2i but of an entire set of compatible observables\ncan be registered in one experiment. All these observables must belong to a single subalgebra\nQ\u03be . Each output channel of the analyzer must then correspond to a set of points of the spectra\nof the observables \u00c2i , one point for each independent observable. Obviously, the analyzer must\n2\n\n\fbe constructed appropriately. The analyzer constructed in this way (and the entire measuring\ndevice) is said to be compatible with the subalgebra Q\u03be .\nThe set of observables \u00c2i need not necessarily be registered by one device. A group of\nmeasuring devices (one complicated device) can be used for this purpose. In this case, the\nentire group (each of its elements) must be compatible with the subalgebra Q\u03be . We assume that\nthe restriction \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) of \u03c6 corresponding to a certain physical state describes the value of the\nobservable \u00c2 that is registered in this physical state by the measuring device compatible with\nthe subalgebra Q\u03be .\nWe assume that the compatibility of a device with a subalgebra is determined by classical\ncharacteristics (construction, spatial position, etc.) of the device. If the device is compatible\nwith a subalgebra Q\u03be , we say that it belongs to the type Q\u03be .\nOne observable can belong to two (and more) different subalgebras, \u00c2 \u2208 Q\u03be \u2229 Q\u03be \u2032 . If the\nfunctional \u03c6 is multivalued at a point \u00c2, it can occur that \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) 6= \u03c6\u03be \u2032 (\u00c2). Physically, this\nmeans that we can register different values of the same observable in the same physical state\nusing different measuring devices. Therefore, the functional \u03c6 does not describe the value of\nthe observable \u00c2 in a certain physical state. It describes the response of the measuring device\nof a certain type to the observable \u00c2. Accordingly, the physical reality is not the value of the\nobservable \u00c2 in a given physical state but the response of the measuring device to this state.\nIf the functional \u03c6 is single-valued at a point \u00c2, we say that the corresponding physical state\n\u03c6 is stable on the observable \u00c2. In this case, we can say that the observable \u00c2 has a definite\nvalue in the physical state \u03c6 and this value is the physical reality.\nThe functionals involved in the third postulate can be shown to have the following properties [4]:\n/1/ \u03c6\u03be (0) = 0;\n\u02c6 = 1;\n/2/ \u03c6\u03be (I)\n\n(1)\n\n/3/ \u03c6\u03be (\u00c22 ) \u2265 0;\n/4/ if \u03bb = \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2), then \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(\u00c2);\n/5/ if \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(\u00c2), then \u03bb = \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) for some \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2).\nHere, \u03c3(\u00c2) is the spectrum of the element \u00c2 in the algebra A. The corresponding properties of individual measurements are postulated in the standard quantum mechanics but are a\nconsequence of the third postulate here.\nThe multivaluedness of a functional \u03c6 allows introducing it consistently. This can be verified by direct construction. Evidently, it suffices to construct the restriction \u03c6\u03be of \u03c6 to each\nsubalgebra Q\u03be .\nWe describe several ways of constructing the functional \u03c6. The first is as follows. In each\nsubalgebra Q\u03be , we arbitrarily choose a system G(Q\u03be ) of independent generators. We next\nrequire \u03c6\u03be to be a certain mapping of G(Q\u03be ) to a real number set S\u03be (allowable points of the\nspectra for the corresponding elements of the set G(Q\u03be )). On the other elements of Q\u03be , the\nfunctional \u03c6\u03be is constructed by linearity and multiplicativity.\nIt is clear that this procedure is always possible if each functional \u03c6\u03be is constructed independently of the others. On the other hand, the functional \u03c6 resulting from this construction is\nhighly ambiguous.\nWe can attempt constructing a single-valued functional \u03c6. For this, we choose some subalgebra Q1 (of type Q) and let G(Q1 ) be a set of generators of Q1 . We define the restriction \u03c61\n\n3\n\n\fof \u03c6 to the subalgebra Q1 by requiring \u03c61 to be some mapping of G(Q1 ) to a real number set\nS1 (points of the spectra for the corresponding elements of Q1 ).\nWe next choose another subalgebra Q2 . With Q1 \u2229 Q2 \u2261 Q12 6= \u2205, we first construct a\nset of generators G12 of Q12 , and then supplement it with the set G21 to the complete set of\ngenerators of Q2 . The restriction \u03c62 is constructed as follows. If \u00c2 \u2208 G12 , then \u03c62 (\u00c2) = \u03c61 (\u00c2).\nIf \u00c2 \u2208 G21 , then the functional \u03c62 is defined such that it is a mapping of G21 to some allowable\nset of points in the spectra of the corresponding elements of the algebra Q2 .\nThe same scheme is used to construct the restrictions of the functional \u03c6 to other subalgebras\nQ\u03be . But this scheme can become inconsistent at a certain stage because the subalgebra Q\u03be can\nhave nonempty intersections with other subalgebras Q\u03be1 , Q\u03be2 , . . . , Q\u03ben for which the restrictions\nof \u03c6 are already fixed. The corresponding mappings can be nonallowable for elements of the\nsubalgebra Q\u03be .\nIn this case, we proceed as follows. Let k be the maximum number (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n) such that the\ndefinitions \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) = \u03c6\u03bei (\u00c2) are allowable for all i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k). With these definitions, we define\nthe functional \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) on the subalgebra Qk = [Q\u03be1 \u222a . . . \u222a Q\u03bek ] \u2229 Q\u03be . We next take some set\nG(k) of generators of the subalgebra Qk and supplement it with the set Gk to a complete set of\ngenerators of Q\u03be . On the generators in Gk , the functional \u03c6\u03be (\u00c2) is defined such that it realizes\nthe mapping of Gk to the set of allowable points of the spectra of the corresponding elements\nof Q\u03be . At this stage, the functional \u03c6 can become multivalued, and a single-valued functional\ntherefore cannot be constructed. But the arising ambiguity is minimal in a certain sense. It\nis therefore impossible to avoid ambiguity in the functional \u03c6 in the general case. Kochen and\nSpecker [5] have given a specific example of this case.\nBut it is always possible to construct a functional \u03c6 that is single-valued on all observables\nbelonging to any preset subalgebra Q\u03be . For this, it suffices to assign the subalgebra Q\u03be number\n1 (set \u03be = 1) and define the restriction \u03c61 of \u03c6 to Q1 as described above. We must next exhaust\nall subalgebras Qi (of type Q\u03be ) that have nonempty intersections with Q1 . To construct the\nrestriction \u03c6i of \u03c6 to each Qi , it suffices to use the recipe used in the previous version in\nconstructing the restriction \u03c62 . By construction, such a functional \u03c6 is single-valued on all\nelements belonging to Q1 . Different subalgebras Qi can have common elements that do not\nbelong to Q1 . On these elements, the functional \u03c6 can be multivalued.\nWe accept the following statement as the fourth postulate.\nThe equality \u03c6\u03be (\u00c21 ) = \u03c6\u03be (\u00c22 ) is satisfied for all \u03c6\u03be if and only if \u00c21 = \u00c22 .\nIn other words, the functional \u03c6 separates arbitrary two different observables. The equality\n\u00c21 = \u00c22 in particular denotes that both elements \u00c21 and \u00c22 simultaneously belong (or do not\nbelong) to a domain of the functional \u03c6\u03be .\n\n3\n\nThe quantum ensemble\n\nThe functional \u03c6 maps the set Q\u03be = {Q\u0302}\u03be into a real number set,\n\u03c6\n\n{Q\u0302}\u03be \u2212\u2192 {Q = \u03c6(Q\u0302)}\u03be .\nFor different functionals \u03c6i and \u03c6j , the sets {\u03c6i (Q\u0302)}\u03be and {\u03c6j (Q\u0302)}\u03be can be different or can\ncoincide. If \u03c6i (Q\u0302) = \u03c6j (Q\u0302) = Q for all Q\u0302 \u2208 {Q\u0302}, then the functionals \u03c6i and \u03c6j are said to be\n{Q}-equivalent. We let {\u03c6}Q be the set of all physical states to which there correspond {Q}equivalent functionals that are stable on the observables in the subalgebra {Q\u0302}\u03be . The set of the\ncorresponding physical states is said to be a (pure) quantum state and is denoted by \u03a8Q . The\nset of physical systems that are in these physical states is said to be the quantum \u03a8Q -ensemble.\n4\n\n\fStrictly speaking, the above definition of the quantum state is only valid for a physical\nsystem that does not contain identical particles. Describing identical particles requires some\ngeneralization of the definition of the quantum state [2].\nWe consider a quantum \u03a8Q -ensemble as a parent population (in the probability theory sense)\nand each experiment to measure an observable \u00c2 as a trial. As the event \u00c3, we consider the\nexperiment where the measured value of the observable \u00c2 is not greater than \u00c3, i.e., \u03c6(\u00c2) = A \u2264\n\u00c3. This event is not unconditional. By the second postulate, one trial cannot be an event for\ntwo noncommuting observables. The probability of the event \u00c3 is determined by the structure\nof the quantum ensemble and by this condition. Let this probability be equal to P (\u00c3).\n\u00c2\nWe let {\u03c6}\u00c2\nQ (with ({\u03c6}Q \u2282 {\u03c6}Q ) denote the set of physical states involved in a denumerable\nsampling from mutually independent random trials of measuring the observable \u00c2. We note that\nB\u0302\nif B\u0302 is an observable not commuting with \u00c2, then the probability that the sets {\u03c6}\u00c2\nQ and {\u03c6}Q\nintersect is equal to zero. Indeed, on the one hand, the observables \u00c2 and B\u0302 cannot be measured\nin one trial. On the other hand, the set {\u03c6}Q has the power of the continuum. Therefore, the\nprobability that the same state from {\u03c6}Q is repeated in two random denumerable samplings is\nequal to zero. Therefore, the additional condition is automatically satisfied with the probability\none for the described samplings.\nBy definition, the probability of the occurrence of an event \u00c3 in each of these trials is P (\u00c3).\nIt determines the probabilistic measure \u03bc(\u03c6) (\u03c6(\u00c2) \u2264 \u00c3) on any such sampling. The measure\n\u03bc(\u03c6) in turn determines a distribution of the values Ai = \u03c6i (\u00c2) of the observable \u00c2 and the\nmathematical expectation < A > in this sampling,\n< A >=\n\nZ\n\n{\u03c6}\u00c2\nQ\n\nd\u03bc(\u03c6) \u03c6(\u00c2).\n\nFor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, let the functionals \u03c6i \u2208 {\u03c6}\u00c2\nQ , then by Khinchin's theorem (the law of large\nnumbers; see, e.g., [6]), the random quantity \u0100n = (A1 + . . . + An )/n converges to < A > in\nprobability as n \u2192 \u221e. Therefore,\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u03c61 (\u00c2) + . . . + \u03c6n (\u00c2) =< A >\u2261 \u03a8Q (\u00c2).\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\nP- lim\n\n(2)\n\nFormula (2) defines a functional (the quantum average) on the set A+ . The totality of\nall quantum experiments unambiguously indicates that we must accept the following linearity\npostulate.\nThe functional \u03a8Q ( ) is linear on the set A+ .\nThis implies that\n\u03a8Q (\u00c2 + B\u0302) = \u03a8Q (\u00c2) + \u03a8Q (B\u0302)\nalso in the case where [\u00c2, B\u0302] 6= 0.\nQuantum experiments support one more postulate. To determine the probability P (\u00c3)\nexperimentally, we must conduct random tests. But these tests are often accompanied in practice\nby some condition because the quantum average of an observable is experimentally found using\nnot a random set of devices capable of measuring this observable but a certain type of such\ndevices. Devices of different types can be used in different series of experiments. Experience\nshows that the probability P (\u00c3) is the same in all these cases. The representativity postulate is\ntherefore true.\nThe probability P (\u00c3) of detecting an event \u00c3 for a system in any quantum state \u03a8Q is\nindependent of the type of the measuring device used for that purpose.\n5\n\n\fObviously, an ideal measuring device is understood here. Any realistic device introduces a\nsystematic error.\nWe now discuss how the representativity postulate requirement can be realized in the proposed approach. Let a functional \u03c6\u03bc be multivalued on an observable \u00c2. This is related to\nthe fact that the result of the observation of a certain quantum object can depend not only\non the internal properties of this object but also on the type of the device intended for investigating the observable \u00c2. We label different types of devices in some fixed manner. Let\n{D1 (\u00c2), D2 (\u00c2), . . . , Dn (\u00c2)} be the set of different types of devices. We label the values of a\nmultivalued functional \u03c6\u03bc on the elements \u00c2 in accordance with the labeling of the measuring\ndevices,\n\u03c6\u03bc (\u00c2) = {A\u03bc1 , . . . , A\u03bcn },\n(3)\nwhere A\u03bci is the indication of the device Di (\u00c2) in the physical state \u03c6\u03bc . Each specific device\nDi (\u00c2) has entirely definite physical characteristics and is therefore compatible with a certain\nsubalgebra Qi (\u00c2 \u2208 Qi ). In this sense, it \"knows\" which value of the functional to choose. For\na specific physical state, some (or all) values A\u03bci can coincide.\nWe next consider another functional \u03c6\u03bd , whose values on the observable \u00c2 are\n\u03c6\u03bd = {A\u03bd1 , . . . , A\u03bdn },\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdn is a certain permutation of \u03bc1, . . . , \u03bcn and A\u03bdi denotes the indication of the\ndevice Di (\u00c2) in the physical state \u03c6\u03bd . Let the functionals \u03c6\u03bc and \u03c6\u03bd coincide on the other\nobservables.\nIf a physical state \u03c6\u03bc belongs to the quantum state \u03a8Q = {\u03c6}Q , then the physical state \u03c6\u03bd\nalso belongs to \u03a8Q . Indeed, if \u00c2 \u2208 {Q\u0302}, then the functionals \u03c6\u03bc and \u03c6\u03bd are single-valued on\n\u00c2 and therefore coincide. If \u00c2 \u2208\n/ {Q\u0302}, then the functionals \u03c6\u03bc and \u03c6\u03bd coincide on Q\u0302 \u2208 {Q\u0302}\nby construction. This argument holds if we consider the functionals obtained by any other\npermutation of the indices \u03bc1, . . . , \u03bcn.\nWe now verify that for the representativity postulate to be satisfied, it suffices to require the\nrelative probabilities of hitting the states \u03c6\u03bc and \u03c6\u03bd to be the same. Indeed, let the device Di (\u00c2)\nbe used to find the mean values of the observable \u00c2 in a quantum state \u03a8Q experimentally and let\n\u03a8iQ (\u00c2) denote the result of this experiment. Theoretically, the quantity \u03a8iQ (\u00c2) is constructed\nas follows. We take some physical state \u03c6\u03bc . This state contributes A\u03bci to \u03a8iQ (\u00c2) with the\nweight w\u03bc (the probability of hitting the state \u03c6\u03bc ). We next take the state \u03c6\u03bd . It contributes\n\u00c2\u03bdi with the weight w\u03bd = w\u03bc . In the same way, we must take all the states obtained by other\npermutations of the arguments in (3) into account. Following the same scheme, we must then\ntake all the physical states that are not related to \u03c6\u03bc by a permutation of the arguments in\nEq. (3) into account.\nNow let the device Dj (\u00c2) be used to find the mean value. The result of this experiment is\ndenoted by \u03a8jQ (\u00c2). To calculate \u03a8jQ (\u00c2) theoretically, we use the above scheme. We again start\nwith the states \u03c6\u03bc , \u03c6\u03bd . . .. We then obtain a set of values A\u03bcj , A\u03bdj . . . that contribute to \u03a8jQ (\u00c2)\nwith the weight w\u03bc . But the sets (A\u03bci , A\u03bdi . . .) and (A\u03bcj , A\u03bdj . . .) differ by only a permutation\nof elements. Therefore, the total contributions of the physical states \u03c6\u03bc , \u03c6\u03bd . . . to \u03a8iQ (\u00c2) and\n\u03a8jQ (\u00c2)) are the same. Similarly, we consider the contributions of the physical states that are\nnot related to \u03c6\u03bc a permutation of arguments. It follows that \u03a8iQ (\u00c2) = \u03a8jQ (\u00c2).\nFor the representativity postulate to be satisfied, it now suffices to verify that for each\nphysical state \u03c6\u03bc , there exists the corresponding state of the type \u03c6\u03bd . Obviously, this is indeed\nso if one additional point is introduced into the constructive scheme of building the set of physical\n6\n\n\fstates described above. Along with each multivaled functional \u03c6\u03bc constructed in accordance with\nthe proposed scheme, all the functionals whose values are obtained by all possible permutations\nof the arguments in Eq. (4) must be introduced into the set of functionals.\nTherefore, although the devices Di (\u00c2) and Dj (\u00c2) can give different results for the same\nphysical state in individual observations, they give the same result for mean values of the observable \u00c2. The proposed model thus gives the same results for determining quantum mean\nvalues of observables as the standard quantum mechanics.\nAny element R\u0302 of the algebra A is uniquely represented as R\u0302 = \u00c2 + iB\u0302, where \u00c2, B\u0302 \u2208 A+ .\nTherefore, the functional \u03a8Q can be uniquely extended to a linear functional on A: \u03a8Q (R\u0302) =\n\u03a8Q (\u00c2) + i\u03a8Q (B\u0302).\nLet R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302 = \u00c22 \u2208 {Q\u0302} (\u00c2 \u2208 A+ ) If \u03c6 \u2208 {\u03c6}Q , then \u03c6(R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302) = A2 . Therefore,\n\u03a8Q (R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302) = A2 = \u03c6(\u00c22 )\n\n\u03c6\u2208{\u03c6}Q\n\n.\n\nIn accordance with inequality (1 /3/), we have A2 \u2265 0. In addition, it follows from condition\n(1 /1/) and the fourth postulate that sup \u03c6(R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302) > 0, if R\u0302 6= 0.\nWe define the norm of an element R\u0302 by\nkR\u0302k2 = sup \u03c6(R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302) = sup \u03a8Q (R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302).\n\u03c6\n\n(5)\n\nQ\n\nBecause \u03a8Q is a positive linear functional, all the axioms of a norm are indeed satisfied for\nkR\u0302k (see [2, 3]). Because \u03c6([\u00c22 ]2 ) = [\u03c6(\u00c22 )]2 , we have kR\u0302\u2217 R\u0302k = kR\u0302k2 , and A is therefore a\nC \u2217 -algebra. Thus, a necessary condition for the consistency of the linearity postulate is the\nfollowing requirement: the algebra A can be endowed with the structure of a C \u2217 -algebra.\nThis requirement can be formulated in purely algebraic terms because the relation [7]\n\u03c1(R\u0302) = kR\u0302k = \u03c11/2 (R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302).\n\n(6)\n\nis valid for a C \u2217 -algebra. Here, \u03c1(R\u0302) is the spectral radius of the element R\u0302, \u03c1(R\u0302) = sup\u03bb |\u03bbR |,\nwhere \u03bbR \u2208 \u03c3(R\u0302).\nUsing Eq.(1 /5/), we can rewrite relation (6) as\nkR\u0302k = [sup \u03c6(R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302)]1/2 .\n\u03c6\n\nwhich agrees with Eq. (5). Therefore, the spectral radius (a purely algebraic notion) of each\nelement of the algebra A must satisfy the norm axioms and the condition \u03c12 (R\u0302) = \u03c1(R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302).\nIn view of the above, it is useful to give a new formulation of the first postulate.\nElements of the algebra A that has the structure of a C \u2217 -algebra correspond to dynamic\nquantities.\nWe did not accept this formulation of the first postulate initially because it follows directly\nfrom the experiment that the observables have algebraic properties and the quantum mean\nvalues have the linearity property. But the mathematical relations involved in the definition of\na C \u2217 -algebra are not directly related to the experiment.\nPostulating that the observables belong to a normed algebra, we must consider the observables to be bounded. In any experiment, we always deal with bounded values of observables.\nNormalizability of the algebra is therefore not a restriction from the experimental standpoint.\nBut many unbounded operators, which are obviously not elements of a normed algebra, occur\nin the quantum theory. In the algebraic approach, \"unbounded observables\" are conventionally\n7\n\n\fconsidered as elements adjoint to the algebra of bounded dynamic quantities; in other words,\nunbounded observables are assumed to admit a spectral representation where the spectral projectors are elements of a normed algebra. The ensuing problems are common to the algebraic\napproach to quantum theory in general. We do not consider them here.\n\n4\n\nTime evolution and the ergodicity condition\n\nIn the standard quantum mechanics, the time evolution is determined by the Heisenberg equation\ni\nh\nd \u00c2(t)\n= i \u0124, \u00c2(t) ,\ndt\n\n\u00c2(0) = \u00c2,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u00c2(t) and the Hamiltonian \u0124 are operators in some Hilbert space. But for (7) to preserve\nits physical meaning, it suffices to consider \u00c2(t) and \u0124 as elements of some algebra (in particular,\nof A) or elements adjoint to the algebra.\nIn our case, the evolution equation can be rewritten in terms of physical states. We therefore\naccept the fifth postulate.\nA physical state of a quantum system evolves in time as\n\u03c6(\u00c2) \u2192 \u03c6t (\u00c2) \u2261 \u03c6(\u00c2(t)),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u00c2(t) is defined by Eq. (7).\nEquation (8) describes time evolution of a physical state entirely unambiguously. It is a different story, though, that an observation allows determining the initial value \u03c6(\u00c2) of a functional\nonly up to its belonging to a certain quantum state {\u03c6}Q [2]. Most of our predictions regarding the time evolution of a quantum object are therefore probabilistic. In addition, Eqs. (7)\nand (8) are valid only for systems that are not exposed to first-class actions (in von Neumann's\nterminology [8]), i.e., do not interact with a classical measuring device.\nWe now return to the linearity postulate. From the experimental standpoint, this postulate\nis well justified. But it is not quite clear whether it can be realized within the mathematical\nscheme considered here. It turns out that this postulate can be related to the time evolution of\nthe quantum system. For this, we must impose restrictions on the Hamiltonian \u0124.\nWe now accept the sixth postulate.\nThe Hamiltonian \u0124 is a Hermitian spectral (possibly, adjoint) element of the algebra A. The\nspectrum of \u0124 contains at least one discrete nondegenerate value E0 .\nThis implies that the Hamiltonian \u0124 has an integral representation of the form\n\u0124 =\n\nZ\n\np\u0302(dE) E,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere p\u0302(dE) are orthogonal projectors. Hereinafter integrations (and also limits) on algebra A\nare understood in sense of the weak topology of C \u2217 -algebra.\nSomewhat conventionally, we can represent p\u0302(dE) as\np\u0302(dE) = p\u0302p (dE) + p\u0302c (dE) =\n\nX\n\np\u0302n \u03b4(E \u2212 En ) dE + p\u0302c (dE).\n\n(10)\n\nn\n\nHere p\u0302p (dE) and p\u0302c (dE) concern to point and continuous spectrums, correspondingly. Besides,\np\u0302n p\u0302m = p\u0302m p\u0302n = 0 for m 6= n, p\u0302n p\u0302c (dE) = p\u0302c (dE)p\u0302n = 0. The sum over n in (10) must necessarily\ninvolve at least one term (n = 0) with a nondegenerate value E0 .\n8\n\n\fIn addition to this last restriction, other requirements are always assumed in considering\nany quantum mechanics model. Requiring a discrete point in the spectrum does not seem too\nrestrictive either. For example, a one-particle quantum system can have a purely continuous\nenergy spectrum. But it can be considered as a one-particle state of an extended system that\ncan also be in the vacuum state in addition to the one-particle state. The energy spectrum of\nthe extended system already has a discrete nondegenerate point in the spectrum.\nThe quantity E0 need not necessarily be the lower bound of the spectrum. By the nondegeneracy of E0 , we assume that the projector p\u03020 in decomposition (10) is one-dimensional. A\nprojector p\u0302 is said to be one-dimensional if it cannot be represented as\nX\n\np\u0302 =\n\np\u0302\u03b1 ,\n\np\u0302\u03b1 6= p\u0302,\n\np\u0302p\u0302\u03b1 = p\u0302\u03b1 p\u0302 = p\u0302\u03b1 .\n\n\u03b1\n\nLet us remark that, if two elements \u00c21 and A2 of algebra A have identical spectral representation of type (9), then they obey the fourth postulate. Therefore, such elements coincide.\nStatement 1.\nIf \u00c2 \u2208 A+ , then \u00c20 = p\u03020 \u00c2p\u03020 has the form \u00c20 = p\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2), where \u03a80 (\u00c2) is some functional.\nProof. Because [\u00c20 , p\u03020 ] = 0, it follows that \u00c20 and p\u03020 have the common spectral decomposition of unity. Because the projector p\u03020 is one-dimensional, the spectral decomposition\nof \u00c20 must have the form \u00c20 = p\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2) + \u00c2\u20320 , where \u00c2\u20320 is orthogonal to p\u03020 . Therefore,\n\u00c20 = p\u03020 \u00c20 = p\u03020 p\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2) + p\u03020 \u00c2\u20320 = p\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2). The statement is proved.\nStatement 2.\nThe functional \u03a80 (\u00c2) is linear.\nProof. Indeed,\np\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2 + B\u0302) = p\u03020 (\u00c2 + B\u0302)p\u03020 = p\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2) + p\u03020 \u03a80 (B\u0302).\nBecause p\u03020 6= 0, it follows that \u03a80 (\u00c2 + B\u0302) = \u03a80 (\u00c2) + \u03a80 (B\u0302), which was to be proved.\nA physical state \u03c60\u03b1 is said to be ground if \u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 ) = 1. By linearity, the functional \u03a80 (\u00c2)\nis uniquely extended to the algebra A, \u03a80 (\u00c2 + i B\u0302) = \u03a80 (\u00c2) + i\u03a80 (B\u0302), where \u00c2, B\u0302 \u2208 A+ .\nStatement 3. The functional \u03a80 (\u00c2) is positive.\nProof. In accordance with property (1 /3/), there is the inequality \u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302p\u03020 ) \u2265 0. On\nthe other hand,\n\u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302p\u03020 ) = \u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 \u03a80 (R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302)) = \u03a80 (R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302)\n. The statement is proved.\n\u02c6 = 1.\nStatement 4. The functional \u03a80 satisfies the normalization condition \u03a80 (I)\nProof. Indeed,\n\u02c6 = \u03a80 (I),\n\u02c6\n1 = \u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 I\u02c6p\u03020 ) = \u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 \u03a80 (I))\nwhich was to be proved.\nTo find the physical meaning of the functional \u03a80 , we consider an element \u0100 in the algebra\nA that corresponds to an observable \u00c2 averaged in time,\n1\n\u0100 = lim\nL\u2192\u221e 2L\n\nL\n\n1\ndt \u00c2(t) = lim\nL\u2192\u221e 2L\n\u2212L\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nL\n\ndt exp[\u2212i\u0124t] \u00c2 exp[i\u0124t].\n\n(11)\n\n\u2212L\n\nThe average is understood with respect to the weak topology of C \u2217 -algebra. Substituting the\nspectral decomposition of \u0124 in (11), we obtain\n1\n\u0100 = lim\nL\u2192\u221e 2L\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n\u2212L\n\ndt\n\n\"\nX\nn\n\np\u0302n \u00c2p\u0302n +\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n#\n\np\u0302c (dE)\u00c2p\u0302c (dE ) exp[i(E \u2212 E)] + B\u0302(t) ,\n9\n\n\fwhere\nB\u0302(t) =\n+\n\nX\u0014\nn\nn6X\n=m\n\np\u0302n \u00c2\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\np\u0302c (dE) exp[i(En \u2212 E)t] + p\u0302c (dE) \u00c2 p\u0302n exp[\u2212i(En \u2212 E)t]\n\np\u0302n \u00c2 p\u0302m exp[i(En \u2212 Em )t]\n\nn,m\n\nIt can be easily shown that the occurrence of time exponentials in this expression implies\nthe relation\nZ L\n1\nlim\ndt B\u0302(t) = 0,\nL\u2192\u221e 2L \u2212L\nand therefore\n\u0100 =\n\nX\n\np\u0302n \u00c2 p\u0302n + D\u0302,\n\nn\n\nwhere\n\n1\nD\u0302 = lim\nL\u2192\u221e 2L\n\nL\n\nZ\n\ndt\n\n\u2212L\n\nZ\n\np\u0302c (dE)\u00c2p\u0302c (dE \u2032 ) exp[i(E \u2032 \u2212 E)].\n\nIn a right-hand side of this equality the integrand \u00c2 exp[i(E \u2032 \u2212 E)] is majorized by magnitude\nk\u00c2k. Therefore,\nthe integrals and the limit exist. Because p\u0302c (dE) = p\u0302c p\u0302c (dE) = p\u0302c (dE)p\u0302c ,\nR\nwhere p\u0302c = p\u0302c (dE), we have D\u0302 = p\u0302c D\u0302 p\u0302c . Therefore,\n\u0100 =\n\nX\n\np\u0302n \u00c2 p\u0302n + p\u0302c D\u0302 p\u0302c .\n\nn\n\nWe now consider the value of the observable \u0100 in the physical ground state \u03c60\u03b1 ,\n\u03c60\u03b1\n\nX\n\np\u0302n \u00c2 p\u0302n + p\u0302c D\u0302 p\u0302c\n\nn\n\n!\n\n= \u03c60\u03b1 (p\u03020 \u00c2 p\u03020 ) + \u03c60\u03b1 (F\u0302 ),\n\n(12)\n\nP\n\nwhere F\u0302 = n6=0 p\u0302n \u00c2 p\u0302n + p\u0302c D\u0302 p\u0302c . We here use the linearity of the functional \u03c60\u03b1 on mutually\ncommuting elements p\u0302n \u00c2 p\u0302n , p\u0302m \u00c2 p\u0302m and p\u0302c D\u0302 p\u0302c . Because p\u0302n p\u03020 = p\u0302c p\u03020 = 0 for n 6= 0, the\nright-hand side of (12) can be rewritten as\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03a80 (\u00c2) + \u03c60\u03b1 (I\u02c6 \u2212 p\u03020 )F\u0302 (I\u02c6 \u2212 p\u03020 ) = \u03a80 (\u00c2) + \u03c60\u03b1 (I\u02c6 \u2212 p\u03020 )\u03c60\u03b1 (I\u02c6 \u2212 p\u03020 )F\u0302 (I\u02c6 \u2212 p\u03020 ) = \u03a80 (\u00c2).\nWe finally have\n\n\u03c60\u03b1 (\u0100) = \u03a80 (\u00c2).\nThe value of the observable \u0100 is the same in all physical ground states.\nThe functional \u03a80 has all the properties that must be possessed by a functional determining\nquantum mean values. It is linear, is positive, and is equal to unity on the unit element. In\naddition, it is continuous as a linear functional on the C \u2217 -algebra. Instead of the linearity axiom,\nwe can therefore accept the seventh postulate (the ergodicity axiom).\nThe mean value of an observable \u00c2 in the ground state of a quantum ensemble is equal to the\nvalue of observable \u0100 (time-averaged value of the observable \u00c2) in any physical ground state.\nTo construct the standard mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, we can now use\nthe canonical construction of Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS)(see, e.g., \u0010[3]).\n\u0011\nWe consider two elements R\u0302, \u015c \u2208 A equivalent if the condition \u03a80 K\u0302 \u2217 (R\u0302 \u2212 \u015c) = 0 is valid\nfor any K\u0302 \u2208 A. We let \u03a6(R\u0302) denote the equivalence class of the element R\u0302 and consider the set\n10\n\n\fA(\u03a80 ) of all equivalence classes in A. We make A(\u03a80 ) a\u0010linear space\u0011setting a\u03a6(R\u0302) + b\u03a6(\u015c) =\n\u03a6(aR\u0302 + b\u015c). The scalar product in A(\u03a80 ) is defined as \u03a6(R\u0302), \u03a6(\u015c) = \u03a80 (R\u0302\u2217 \u015c). This scalar\nproduct generates the norm k\u03a6(R\u0302)k2 = \u03a80 (R\u0302\u2217 R\u0302) in A(\u03a80 ). Completion with respect to this\nnorm makes A(\u03a80 ) a Hilbert space. Each element \u015c of the algebra A is uniquely assigned a\nlinear operator \u03a0\u03a8 (\u015c) acting in this space as \u03a0\u03a8 (\u015c)\u03a6(R\u0302) = \u03a6(\u015c R\u0302).\nWe note that using the ground state \u03a80 is not a necessary condition in the GNS construction. All our argument can be based not on the projection operator p\u03020 but on any other\none-dimensional projection operator p\u0302. In this case, there is also the equality\np\u0302\u00c2p\u0302 = p\u0302\u03a8p (\u00c2),\n\n(13)\n\n\u02c6 = 1.\nwhere \u03a8p (\u00c2) is a functional with the linearity and positivity properties; in addition, \u03a8p (I)\nInstead of the physical ground states \u03c60\u03b1 , we can use the basic physical states \u03c6p\u03b1 . These\nstates satisfy the condition \u03c6p\u03b1 (p\u0302) = 1. The set {\u03c6p\u03b1 } of physical states constitutes the base\nquantum state {\u03c6}p . Instead of the ergodicity axiom, we can postulate that the quantum average\nin the state {\u03c6}p is defined by the functional \u03a8p in Eq. (13). In this case, we lose the relation of\nthe quantum average to the time average. As a compensation, the theory becomes more flexible\nbecause the assumptions regarding the spectrum of the Hamiltonian become redundant.\n\n5\n\nAn example\n\nTo illustrate the above, we consider a quantum system whose observable quantities are described\nby Hermitian 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. The elements \u0124, p\u03020 , and \u00c2 are given by\n\u0124 =\n\n\"\n\nE0\n0\n0 \u2212E0\n\n#\n\n,\n\np\u03020 =\n\n\"\n\n0 0\n0 1\n\n#\n\n,\n\n\u00c2 =\n\n\"\n\na b\nc d\n\n#\n\n.\n\nObviously, p\u03020 \u03a80 (\u00c2) = p\u03020 \u00c2 p\u03020 = p\u03020 d, i.e.,\n\u03a80 (\u00c2) = d.\n\n(14)\n\nIn addition,\n1\n\u0100 = lim\nL\u2192\u221e 2L\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n\u2212iE0 t\u03c43\n\ndt e\n\niE0 t\u03c43\n\n\u00c2 e\n\n=\n\n\u2212L\n\n\"\n\na 0\n0 d\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c4i are Pauli matrices.\nAll physical states can easily be constructed. We consider a Hermitian matrix \u00c2, i.e., with\na\u2217 = a, d\u2217 = d, and c = b\u2217 . Any such matrix can be represented as\n\u00c2 = r0 I\u02c6 + r \u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere n\u0304 is the unit three-dimensional vector, \u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304) = (\u03c4\u0304 n\u0304). For Eq.(16) to be valid, we must\nr=\n\n(a \u2212 d)2\n+ b b\u2217\n4\n\n!1/2\n\n,\n\nr0 =\n\na+d\n,\n2\n\nb + b\u2217\nb \u2212 b\u2217\na\u2212d\n, n2 =\n, n3 =\n.\n2r\n2ir\n2r\nThe commutator of the matrices \u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304), \u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304\u2032 ) is nonvanishing for n\u0304\u2032 6= \u00b1n\u0304. Therefore, each\nmatrix \u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304) (up to a sign) is a generator of a real maximal commutative subalgebra. Because\n\u02c6 the spectrum of \u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304) consists of two points \u00b11.\n\u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304)\u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304) = I,\nn1 =\n\n11\n\n\fLet {f (n\u0304)} be the set of all functions taking the values \u00b11 and such that f (\u2212n\u0304) = \u2212f (n\u0304).\nA physical state is described by a functional whose value coincides with one of the points in the\nspectrum of the corresponding algebra element. For each point of the spectrum, there exists\nan appropriate functional. Therefore, to the set of physical states, there corresponds a set of\nfunctionals defined by\n\u03c6 (\u03c4\u0302 (n\u0304)) = f (n\u0304).\nTaking properties (1) into account (which must be possessed by each physical state), we obtain\n\u03c6(\u00c2) = r0 + r f (n\u0304).\n\n(17)\n\nThe ground state is any functional \u03c60\u03b1 such that\nf (n1 = 0, n2 = 0, n3 = 1) = \u22121.\nSubstituting the element \u0100 ((15)) in (17), we obtain\n\u03c60\u03b1 (\u0100) =\n\na+d a\u2212d\n+\n= d.\n2\n2\n\nThis agrees with (14).\nIn this model, we can do without multivalued functionals. If we considered the algebra of\nmatrices describing unit spin, multivalued functionals would inevitably arise. This was noted\n(in other terms) by Kochen and Specker [5].\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn principle, a physical state can be considered as a special hidden parameter. But because of\nthe multivaluedness of the functional \u03c6, the conditions of the Kochen and Specker no-go theorem\n[5] are not satisfied for this hidden parameter. It was noted in [2] that the conditions of the von\nNeumann no-go theorem [8] are not satisfied for \u03c6. In addition, it was also shown there that the\nconditions of Bell's theorem [9] are not satisfied for the functional \u03c6. Therefore, the arguments\nthat are usually adduced by opponents of the use of hidden parameters in quantum mechanics\nbecome inapplicable for the physical state.\nRegarding the multivaluedness of the functional \u03c6, the physical process that is usually called\na measurement should rather be called an observation. The term \"observation\" better expresses\nthe fact that the indication of the device in use has two causes: the physical state of the\nobserved object and the type of the device. The type of the device is then defined not only\nby the observable that it must register but also by an ignored parameter of the device. In the\nproposed approach, the type of the measuring device plays the role of such an ignored parameter.\nDifferent types of devices correspond to different maximal commutative subalgebras to which\na given observable belongs. Unlike the values of a hidden parameter, the value of the ignored\nparameter can in principle be established experimentally.\nThe result of an observation experiment (the physical reality) is thus determined by two\nother physical realities: the physical state of the observed object and the type of the observing\ndevice. In an individual quantum experiment, in contrast to a classical one, the second physical\nreality cannot be neglected in general. But even in the quantum case, it is possible not to take\nthe type of the measuring device into account in an experiment determining the mean values of\nan observable.\nAcknowledgments.
