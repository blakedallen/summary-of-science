We show that a finite cover is biholomorphic and isometric to\na flat torus bundle over a compact K\u00e4hler manifold N k with c1 < 0. This confirms a conjecture of Yau.

We also prove a global splitting result under the\nassumption of certain immersed complex submanifolds.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe uniformization theorem of Riemann surfaces says the sign of curvature\ncould determine the conformal structure in some sense. Explicitly, if the curvature is positive, it is covered by P1 or C. On the other hand, if the curvature is less\nthan a negative constant, it is covered by the unit disk D2 .\nIt is natural to wonder whether there are generalizations in higher dimensions.\nFor the compact case, the famous Frankel conjecture says if a compact K\u00e4hler\nmanifold has positive holomorphic bisectional curvature, then it is biholomorphic\nto CPn . This conjecture was solved by Mori [13] and Siu-Yau [15] independently.\nIn fact Mori proved the stronger Hartshorne conjecture. Later, Mok [12] solved\nthe generalized Frankel conjecture. The result says that, if a compact K\u00e4hler manifold has nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature, then the universal cover is\nisometric-biholomorphic to (Ck , g0 )\u00d7(Pn1 , \u03b81 )\u00d7***\u00d7(Pnl , \u03b8l )\u00d7(M1 , g1 )\u00d7***\u00d7(Mi , gi ),\nwhere g0 is flat; \u03b8k are metrics on Pnk with nonnegative holomorphic bisectional\ncurvature; (M j , g j ) are compact irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces.\nIf the curvature is negative, the current knowledge is much less satisfactory.\nFor example, a famous conjecture of Yau says if a complete simply connected\nK\u00e4hler manifold has sectional curvature between two negative constants, then it\nis a bounded domain in Cn . So far, it is not even known whether there exists a\nnontrivial bounded holomorphic function on such manifolds.\nAs in the Riemannian case, it is often important to understand the difference\nbetween the negatively curved case and the nonpositive case. The former tends to\nbe hyperbolic in some sense, while the latter usually possesses some rigidity properties. For compact K\u00e4hler manifolds with nonpositive holomorphic bisectional\ncurvature, there is a conjecture of Yau (page 2 of [17], also [16]):\nConjecture. Let M n be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive holomorphic\nbisectional curvature. Then there exists a finite cover M \u2032 of M such that M \u2032 is\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGANG LIU\n\na holomorphic and metric fibre bundle over a compact K\u00e4hler manifold N with\nnonpositive bisectional curvature and c1 (N) < 0, and the fiber is a flat complex\ntorus.\nRecall that a fiber bundle is called a metric bundle, if for any p \u2208 N, there is\nsome neighborhood p \u2208 U \u2282 N such that the bundle over U is isometric to the\nproduct of the fiber with U. In [22], Yau proved the following\nTheorem 1. Let M be a compact complex submanifold of a complex torus T n . Then\nM is a torus bundle over a complex submanifold N in T n such that the induced\nK\u00e4hler metric on N has negative definite Ricci tensor in an open dense set of N.\nSince complex submanifolds in T n has nonpositive holomorphic bisectional curvature, Yau's theorem confirms the conjecture when M is a complex submanifold\nof T n . Zheng [27] proved this conjecture under the extra assumption that M has\nnonpositive sectional curvature and the metric is real analytic. In [17], Wu and\nZheng proved this conjecture by only assuming that the metric is real analytic.\nThey first proved a local splitting result by a careful study of the foliation at the\npoints where the Ricci tensor has maximal rank. By real analyticity, the foliation\ncould be extended to the whole manifold. In this note we confirm the conjecture\nabove.\nTheorem 2. Let (M n , g) be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive holomorphic bisectional curvature. Then there exists a finite cover M \u2032 of M such that M \u2032\nis a holomorphic and metric fiber bundle over a compact K\u00e4hler manifold N k with\nnonpositive bisectional curvature and the Ricci curvature is strict negative in an\nopen set on N. Thus c1 (N) < 0. The fiber is a flat complex torus T . Furthermore,\nM \u2032 is diffeomorphic to T \u00d7N. Finally, if r is the maximal rank of the Ricci curvature\nof g, then r = k = Kod(M) where Kod(M) is the Kodaira dimension of M.\nCorollary 1. For any compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive bisectional curvature, the Kodaira dimension is equal to the maximal rank of the Ricci tensor.\nCorollary 2. Let M n be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive bisectional\ncurvature. If the Ricci tensor degenerates everywhere, i.e., the maximal rank of the\nRicci tensor is strictly less than n, then the universal cover splits off a nontrivial\ncomplex Euclidean factor holomorphically and isometrically.\nOne can ask a question similar to corollary 2 in the Riemannian setting. Namely,\nfor a compact Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature, if the\nRicci tensor degenerates everywhere, is it true that the universal cover has a nontrivial Euclidean factor? In Guler and Zheng's paper [7], a counterexample (due\nto Gromov) is given. We explain the example in some details (Page 2 in [7]) for\ncomparison with the K\u00e4hler case.\nTake a punctured torus Y and equip it with nonpositive curvature such that the\nmetric near the boundary is isometric to [0, 1] \u00d7 S1 . Take two copies of Y \u00d7 S1 and\nglue them along the boundary, but with the S1 factors switched. Then the resulting\n3-manifold M has nonpositive sectional curvature with Ricci tensor degenerates\neverywhere, but the universal cover does not contain an Euclidean factor.\n\n\fCOMPACT K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS WITH NONPOSITIVE BISECTIONAL CURVATURE\n\n3\n\nSimilarly a four manifold is obtained if we glue two copies of Y \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S1 by\nswitching some S1 factors. By theorem 2, this cannot be a counterexample in the\nK\u00e4hler case. The reason is that if we switch the S1 factor, the metrics match, but\nthe complex structures do not match!\nIt is interesting to compare the Riemannian case with the K\u00e4hler case. Here we\nare assuming that M is a compact (K\u00e4hler) manifold with nonpositive sectional\n(bisectional) curvature and the Ricci tensor degenerates (If M is only Riemannian,\njust ignore the parentheses).\n\u2022 If M is Riemannian, the universal cover of M does not necessarily have an\nEuclidean factor.\n\u2022 If M is Riemannian with real analytic metric, the universal cover of M does\nhave a nontrivial Euclidean factor.\n\u2022 If M is K\u00e4hler with real analytic metric, the universal cover of M has a\nnontrivial complex Euclidean factor (in metric and holomorphic sense).\n\u2022 If M is K\u00e4hler, the universal cover of M has a nontrivial complex Euclidean\nfactor (in metric and holomorphic sense).\nAmong the four conclusions, the first two are given in [7]; the third is proved in\n[17]; the last one is corollary 2.\nTheorem 3. Let (M n , g) be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive holomorphic bisectional curvature. Suppose N n\u2212k \u2282 M is a complete (compact or noncompact) immersed complex submanifold of M which is flat and totally geodesic. If\nin addition, Ric(M)|T N = 0, then M splits globally, i.e., the universal cover M\u0303 is\nisometric and biholomorphic to Cn\u2212k \u00d7 Y k where Y k is a complete K\u00e4hler manifold\nof dimension k.\nRemark. All assumptions in theorem 3 are \"local\" around N, except that the holomorphic bisectional curvature on M is nonpositive. Thus it might be interesting to\nsee that local assumptions imply global splitting. Theorem 3 also holds if we assume the manifold has nonnegative bisectional curvature. We can also weaken the\nconditions by assuming that M is complete with bounded curvature. Finally, note\nthat theorem 3 is not true for the Riemannian case.\nIn [17], Wu and Zheng studied the foliation given by the kernel of the Ricci\ntensor at the points where the Ricci tensor has the maximal rank. See section 2,\npart 3 for some explanations of this foliation. For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, define U(i) = {x \u2208\nM|rank(Ric(x)) = i}. If p is an interior point of U(i), then there is a foliation near\np given by the kernel of the Ricci tensor. We can extend the leaves as long as the\npoints are in the interior of U(i). It is natural to wonder the following:\nQuestion. Will the leaf through p touch the boundary of U(i)?\nIn [5], Ferus showed that if i is the maximal rank of the Ricci tensor, then the\nleaf through p will stay in U(i). Thus it is complete. We have a complete answer\nto the question above:\nCorollary 3. The leaf through p does not touch the boundary of U(i) if and only if\ni the maximal rank of the Ricci tensor on M.\n\n\f4\n\nGANG LIU\n\nNext we discuss two applications of theorem 2. The existence of canonical\nmetrics is a central topic in K\u00e4hler geometry. We shall restrict to the case when\nc1 \u2264 0. Yau [24] solved the famous Calabi conjecture. He proved that any compact\nK\u00e4hler manifold with c1 < 0 or c1 = 0 admits a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric. Aubin\n[1] also obtained the proof when c1 < 0. It is natural to ask whether there exist\ncanonical metrics on K\u00e4hler manifolds with nonpositive bisectional curvature.\nCorollary 4. Let (M n , g0 ) be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive holomorphic bisectional curvature. Then the manifold admits a canonical metric g\nwhich is locally a product of a flat metric with a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric with\nnegative scalar curvature. More precisely, (M, g) is locally biholomorphic and\nisometric to (Dn\u2212k , g1 ) \u00d7 (U k , g2 ). Here k = Kod(M); (Dn\u2212k , g1 ) is a flat complex Euclidean ball with small radius; (U k , g2 ) is a small ball in Ck such that\nRic(g2 ) = \u2212g2 .\nProof. According to theorem 2, there exists a flat fibration T n\u2212k \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192 N where\nM \u2032 is a finite cover of M. The universal cover M\u0303 is biholomorphic to Cn\u2212k \u00d7 \u00d1\nwhere \u00d1 \u2192 N is the universal covering. Since c1 (N) < 0, N admits a unique\nK\u00e4hler-Einstein metric g2 . Thus \u00d1 admits a complete K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric with\nnegative scalar curvature. Any element a \u2208 \u03c01 (M) induces a deck transformation f\non M\u0303 which descends to a biholomorphism of \u00d1. By Yau's Schwarz lemma [23],\nthe K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric on \u00d1 is unique. Thus f preserves the K\u00e4hler-Einstein\nmetric g2 on \u00d1. Therefore, the product metric on Cn\u2212k \u00d7 (\u00d1, g2 ) descends to a\nmetric on M which is canonical.\n\u0003\nIt is also interesting to analyze the long time behavior of the normalized K\u00e4hlerRicci flow\n\u2202gi j\n= \u2212Ri j \u2212 gi j\n(1)\n\u2202t\non such manifolds. Cao [3] proved that if a compact K\u00e4hler manifold (M, \u03c9) has\nc1 < 0 or c1 = 0 (without normalization), then the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow converges to\na K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric. Tsuji [21] and Tian-Zhang [20] proved that if a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold has c1 \u2264 0, then the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow has long time existence. In [18], Song and Tian considered the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow on an\nelliptic surface f : X \u2192 \u03a3 where some of the fibers may be singular. It was shown\nthat the flow converges to a generalized K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric. This result was\ngeneralized in [19] to the fibration f : X \u2192 Xcan where X is a nonsingular algebraic variety with semi-ample canonical bundle and Xcan is its canonical model.\nWe have a result in the similar spirit.\nCorollary 5. Let M n be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive bisectional\ncurvature. Then for any initial K\u00e4hler metric g(0), the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci\nflow converges in C \u221e (M) to the K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric factor in corollary 4.\nProof. Let M \u2032 be in theorem 2. We consider the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\non M \u2032 which is diffeomorphic to T \u00d7 N. Recall a theorem of M. Gill [6] which\ngeneralizes a theorem in [14] by Song and Weinkove,\n\n\fCOMPACT K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS WITH NONPOSITIVE BISECTIONAL CURVATURE\n\n5\n\nTheorem 4. Let X = Y \u00d7 T where Y is a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with negative\nfirst Chern class and T is a complex torus. Let \u03c9(t) be the normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci\nflow on X with any initial metric \u03c9(0), then \u03c9(t) converges to \u03c0\u2217 (\u03c9Y ) in C \u221e (X, \u03c90 )\nsense as t \u2192 \u221e where \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y is the projection and \u03c9Y is the K\u00e4hler-Einstein\nmetric on Y.\nNote that M \u2032 is not necessarily biholomorphic to T \u00d7 N. However, M \u2032 is locally\nbiholomorphic to T \u00d7 U where U is an open set in N. Thus there is a flat metric \u03c9T\non the fiber independent of the projection to N. Then one can check that the proof\nof theorem 4 in [6] works in this case without any modification. The projection of\nthe K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow from M \u2032 to M concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nThe proof of theorem 2 uses Hamilton's Ricci flow [8] and Hamilton's maximum principle for tensors [9][4][2], together with some argument in [17] by Wu\nand Zheng. We will use the invariant convex set constructed in [2] by B\u00f6hm and\nWilking. The key point is to prove that there exists a small \u01eb > 0 such that along\nthe Ricci flow, Ric(g(t)) \u2264 0 for all 0 < t < \u01eb (note that the holomorphic bisectional curvature is not necessarily nonpositive for small t). The final assertion\nrank(Ric(g(0))) = k will follow from an argument of Yu [26].\nRemark. There is a general philosophy that the Ricci flow makes the curvature\ntowards positive, e.g., Hamilton-Ivey pinching estimate [10][11]. So it might be\ninteresting to see that in our case, at least in a short time, the Ricci curvature\nremains nonpositive.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to express his deep gratitude to his former advisor, Professor Jiaping Wang, for his kind help and useful suggestions.

Preliminaries\nHamilton's Maximum Principle\nLet M n be a closed oriented manifold with a smooth family of Riemannian metrics g(t), t \u2208 [0, T ]. Let V \u2192 M be a real vector bundle with a time dependent\nmetric h and \u0393(V) be the vector space of smooth sections on V. Let \u2207tL denote\nthe corresponding Levi-Civita connection on (M, g(t)). Furthermore, let \u2207t denote\na time dependent metric connection on V. For a section R \u2208 \u0393(V), define a new\nsection \u2206t R \u2208 \u0393(V) as follows. For p \u2208 M choose an orthonormal basis of V p (the\nfiber of V at p) and extend it along the radial geodesics in (M, g(t)) emanating from\np by parallel transport of \u2207t to an orthonormal basis X1 (q), ..., Xd (q) of Vq for all q\nd\nP\nin a small neighborhood of p.

Roughly\nspeaking, Hamilton's maximum principle says that the dynamics of the parabolic\nequation (2) is controlled by the ordinary differential equation\ndR\n= f (R(p, t)).\ndt\nMore precisely, we have the following version of Hamilton's maximum principle [2][4]:\n(3)\n\nTheorem 5. For t \u2208 [0, \u03b4], let C(t) \u2286 V be a closed subset, depending continuously\non t. Suppose that each of the sets C(t) is invariant under parallel transport, fiberwise convex and that the family of C(t) (0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03b4) is invariant under the ordinary\ndifferential equation (3).

With the isometry u(t) :\n(W, k) \u2192 (T C M, gt ), we can pull back any complex vector bundle over M associated\nto the principle bundle P of unitary frames of (T C M, gt ).\nLet H be an 2n dimensional real vector space with complex structure J and Jinvariant inner product g(*, *). Define\nHC = H \u2297R C. Then\n\u221a we extend J and g\n\u221a\nlinearly to HC . Define U = {X \u2212 \u22121JX, X \u2208 H}, U = {X + \u22121JX, X \u2208 H}. Then\nU \u2295 U = HC . Let K be a subspace of \u22974 H \u2217 such that for any R \u2208 K,\n\u2022 R(x, y, z, w) = \u2212R(y, x, z, w) = R(z, w, x, y) for x, y, z, w \u2208 H;\n\u2022 R(x, y, z, w) + R(y, z, x, w) + R(z, x, y, w) = 0 for x, y, z, w \u2208 H;\n\u2022 R(X, Y, z, w) = 0 for X, Y \u2208 U, z, w \u2208 H (here we extend R complex linearly).\nThe curvature tensor R of the K\u00e4hler manifold (M, g) can be considered as a\nsection in the associated bundle\n(4)\n\nV = PW \u00d7U(n) K.\n\n\fCOMPACT K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS WITH NONPOSITIVE BISECTIONAL CURVATURE\n\n7\n\nHere PW is the unitary frame bundle.

Let M be a compact\nK\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive bisectional curvature. Then the Ricci form is\nnegative semi-definite. Let r be the maximal (complex) rank of the Ricci form and\nU be the open set on M where the rank of Ric is equal to r. Denote by L the\ndistribution in U given by the kernel of the Ricci tensor.\nBy linear algebra, the nonpositivity of the bisectional curvature implies that X \u2208\nL if and only if R(X, \u2217, \u2217, \u2217) \u2261 0, where R is the curvature tensor. So L is the kernel\nof the curvature tensor. Thus it is a foliation, whose leaves are totally geodesic, flat\ncomplex submanifolds of U. By a theorem of Ferus [5], each leaf of L is complete.\n3. The proof of theorem 2\n\u2202g\n\nProof. Let g(t) be the solution to the Ricci flow equation \u2202ti j = \u2212Rici j with g(0) =\ng. Let V be defined as in (4). Following B\u00f6hm and Wilking [2], we shall construct\na family of convex sets Vt of V which are invariant under parallel transport and Vt\nis invariant under the evolution equation (7) for small t. The precise statement is\nthe following:\nProposition 1. Let K2 be a positive constant. Then there exist positive constants\nK1 , K3 , \u01eb depending only on K2 and n such that \u01ebK1 \u2264 1, \u01ebK3 \u2264 21 and the following\nhold: For t \u2265 0, let Vt be a subset of K\u00e4hler curvature operators R in V satisfying\nthe following conditions:\n(1).

Moreover, Vt is invariant under the evolution equation (7) for 0 \u2264 t < \u01eb.\nProof. Through the course of the proof of proposition 1, we will assume \u01ebK1 \u2264 1.\nThe explicit values of \u01eb and K1 will be determined by the end of the proof of the\nproposition. It is clear that Vt is closed and invariant under parallel transport. Given\nany positive constants K2 , K1 , K3 , \u01eb, we prove Vt is fiberwise convex for each t. It\nis easy to see that (3) defines a convex set. Suppose R and S in V satisfy (1) and\n(2). For any 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1, define\nT = \u03bbR + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)S .\n\nObviously T satisfies (1).

For any a \u2208 [0, \u01eb),\nlet R\u03bb be the solution to (7) with the initial condition R\u03bb (a) = R(a) \u2212 \u03bbR\u2032 .

In the last step, we used that the\ndv dv\nkernel of Rict is parallel. Take s = dv\ndt . Then (24) and (25) imply Rict ( dt , dt ) = 0.\nThis means the kernel of Rict is invariant for 0 < t < \u01eb1 .\nBy proposition 1, the kernel of the Ricci tensor is the kernel of the curvature\noperator. De Rham theorem says the universal cover ( M\u0303, g(t)) has a flat factor\nCn\u2212k for 0 < t < \u01eb1 . By a holonomy argument, the universal cover ( M\u0303, g0 ) is\nbiholomorphic and isometric to Cn\u2212k \u00d7 Y k where Y k is a complete K\u00e4hler manifold\nwith nonpositive bisectional curvature.\nLet r be the maximal rank of the Ricci curvature of g = g0 . We follow the\nargument in [26] to show that r = k = dim(Y). It is clear that\nr \u2264 k,\n\n(26)\n\nsince the rank of Rict is k for 0 < t \u2264 \u01eb1 . Recall corollary C in [17] (page 277):\nTheorem 7. If M n is a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive bisectional curvature which has Ricci rank r < n, then the open set U in which the Ricci tensor has\nmaximum rank r in the universal cover M\u0303 is, locally, holomorphically isometric to\nLa \u00d7 Ya , where La is a complete flat K\u00e4hler manifold, and Ya is a K\u00e4hler manifold\nwith nonpositive bisectional curvature and negative Ricci curvature.\nWe apply theorem 7 to the compact K\u00e4hler manifold M in theorem 2. It is\nimmediate to see that dim(Ya ) = r since Ya has negative Ricci curvature. Let f\nbe the holomorphic immersion La \u2192 M\u0303 given by theorem 7. By the evolution\nequation of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow,\n\u221a\n\u2202\nRic = \u22121\u2202\u2202R\n\u2202t\n\u221a\nwhere R is the scalar curvature and Ric = \u22121Ri j dzi \u2227 dz j . Let p be any point\n(27)\n\nin f (La ). For ei \u2208 T p1,0 f (La ), by theorem 6, Ric(g(\u01eb1 )) \u2264 0 and Ricii (g(0)) = 0.\nTherefore\n(28)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n0 \u2265 f Ricii (g(\u01eb1 )) \u2212 f Ricii (g(0)) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22121\u2202i \u2202i\n\nZ\u01eb1\n0\n\nR(p, t)dt.\n\n\f14\n\nGANG LIU\n\nR\u01eb1\n(28) implies that \u2212 R(p, t)dt is a bounded plurisubharmonic function on La . Since\n0\n\nLa is flat, the function must be a constant. Therefore Ricii (g(\u01eb1 )) = 0 for any\nei \u2208 T 1,0 La . Then k = rank of Ric(g(\u01eb1 )) \u2264 n\u2212dim(La )= n \u2212 (n \u2212 r) = r. Combining\nthis with (26), we find r = k. Therefore, for the metric g = g(0), the Ricci curvature\nis negative somewhere on Y.\nRecall theorem E in [17] (page 278):\nTheorem 8. Let M n be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with real analytic metric and\nnonpositive bisectional curvature. Denote by r its Ricci rank. Then there exists a\nfinite covering M \u2032 of M, such that q : M \u2032 \u2192 N r is a holomorphic fiber bundle over\ncompact K\u00e4hler manifold N r with nonpositive bisectional curvature and c1 (N) < 0,\nwhile the fiber of q is a complex (n \u2212 r) torus T .\nFurthermore, M \u2032 is diffeomorphic to N\u00d7T , and q is a metric bundle, i.e., \u2200x \u2208 N,\nthere exists a small neighborhood x \u2208 V \u2282 N such that q\u22121 V is isometric to T \u00d7 V.\nIn Wu and Zheng's proof of theorem E, the real analyticity condition is only\nused to show that the universal cover splits as Cn\u2212r \u00d7 Y r where Y r is a simply\nconnected, complete K\u00e4hler manifold with nonpositive bisectional curvature, and\nthe Ricci tensor of Y r is negative definite somewhere. Since this is confirmed\nwithout assuming the real analyticity of the metric, Wu and Zheng's proof works\nin our case without any modification.\nNext we show r = k = Kod(M). Recall theorem 6.10(2) in [25]:\nTheorem 9. Let f : V \u2192 W be a finite unramified covering of complex manifolds.\nThen Kod(V) = Kod(W).\nSince M \u2032 is a finite cover of M, Kod(M) = Kod(M \u2032 ). Note that pluricanonical\nsections on M \u2032 could be reduced to pluricanonical sections on N. Thus Kod(M \u2032 ) =\nKod(N) = k, since c1 (N) < 0. The proof of Theorem 2 is complete.\n\u0003\n4. The proof of theorem 3\nProof. Let g(t) be the solution to the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow with g(0) = g. Then by\ntheorem 6, the Ricci curvature will be nonpositive in a short time. By assumption,\nN is an immersed totally geodesic flat complex submanifold of M and Ric(M)|T N =\n0. Applying equation (28), we find that Ric(M, g(t))|T N vanishes for small t > 0.\nThen rank(Ric(g(0)) = rank(Ric(g(t)) \u2264 k. By corollary 2, M\u0303 has a flat factor\nCn\u2212k .\n\u0003\nProof of corollary 3: Let r be the maximal rank of the Ricci tensor of M. We\nonly need to prove that if the leaf Ln\u2212i through p stays in the interior of U(i), then\ni = r. In this case, Ln\u2212i must be a complete totally geodesic immersed complex\nsubmanifold in M such that Ric(M)|T L = 0. By theorem 3, the universal cover of\nM splits off a factor Cn\u2212i . Thus r \u2264 n \u2212 (n \u2212 i) = i. The proof of corollary 3 is\ncomplete.\n\n\fCOMPACT K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS WITH NONPOSITIVE BISECTIONAL CURVATURE\n\n15\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
