These phenomena can be studied by\ndifferent theoretical approaches, including phenomenological\narguments [2], mean field models [12], functional renormalisation group for statics [13\u201339] and driven dynamics [40\u201347].\nThey were also studied with numerical techniques [48\u201351].\nIn several cases the experimental results seem to be in reasonable agreement with the theory (see [52] for vortex lattices,\n\n[53] for ferroelectrics , and [1] for magnetic interfaces), but\nsome discrepancies are still manifest, at least with the simplest theories, in some cases, e.g. the depinning of the contact\nline of a fluid [6, 7, 47].\nRecent theoretical progress allows not only for qualitative,\nbut also for quantitative tests. On one hand, for interfaces,\npowerful algorithms now allow to find the exact depinning\nthreshold and critical configuration on a cylinder [51, 54] and\nto study creep dynamics [55]. On the other hand the functional RG (FRG) has been extended beyond the lowest order\n(one loop), and it was shown that differences between statics\nand depinning become manifest only at two loops [13, 40],\n\u2206(u) 1\n\nw \u2212 uw \u2212 hw \u2212 uw i\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n20\n\n\u2206\u2217 (u)\n\n0.4\nw\n10200\n\n10400\n\n10600\n\n10800\n\n11000\n\n0.2\nm2 = 0.003\n\n2\n\n-20\n\n-0.2\n\nm2 = 1\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8u\n\n-40\n\nFIG. 1: Dynamical shocks (avalanches): position of a particle uw\npulled by a spring, of varying equilibrium position w, in a one dimensional random force landscape (with forces uniformly distributed\nbetween 0 and 1). The quasi-static motion shows a succession of\njumps, also called shocks. Decreasing the spring constant (the mass)\nfrom m2 = 0.01 (red) over m2 = 0.03 (green) to m2 = 0.001\n(blue), the shocks become larger and larger.\n\nFIG. 2: (a): The measured correlator \u2206(u) for a particle pulled in\na random potential (i.e. RB disorder) distributed\nuniformly in [0, 1],\nR\u221e\nand rescaled such Rthat \u2206(0) = 1 and 0 du|\u2206(u)| = 1. From\n\u221e\nbottom (which has 0 du\u2206(u) \u2248 0) to top the mass decreases from\n2\n2\nm = 1 (red) to m = 0.5 (green) to m2 = 0.003 (blue), where\nit has (up to small corrections) converged to the fixed point \u2206\u2217 (u).\nThis demonstrates in d = 0 the expected crossover from randombond to random-field disorder (see text). Note that the fixed point\nhas a cusp singularity at u = 0.\n\n\f2\ni.e. to second order in an expansion in d = 4 \u2212 \u01eb where d is\nthe internal dimension of the manifold. Such differences appear for instance in the roughness exponent \u03b6. The FRG is\na field theoretic tool for disordered systems, which captures\nthe complex glassy physics of numerous metastable states at\nthe expense of introducing, rather than a single coupling as\nin standard critical phenomena, a function, \u2206(u), of the displacement field u, which flows to a fixed point (FP) \u2206\u2217 (u).\nThis FP is non-analytic, as is the effective action of the theory.\nThe non-analyticity is a rather unconventional feature, and the\nvalidity of the approach has been questioned: one could argue\nthat, although \u2206\u2217 (u) is perturbative near d = 4, the second\nderivative \u2206\u2032\u2032 (0) has gone to infinity, hence we have left the\ndomain controlled by perturbation theory. To put this criticism to rest, one first shows how an observable of the experimental system can be defined, which is identical to the field\ntheoretic disorder correlator \u2206(u): the idea [56] is to add a\nquadratic confining potential to the system, which formally\nacts as a mass for the elastic modes of the interface. The disorder correlator \u2206(u), can then be measured directly as the\nsecond moment of the interface displacement.\nThis method has been used in a numerical simulation of interfaces in a disordered magnet, to compute numerically the\nzero-temperature FRG fixed-point function \u2206(u) in the statics, for interfaces (N = 1) using powerful exact minimization\nalgorithms [59]. A variety of disorder types, random-bond,\nrandom-field and periodic disorder were studied in various dimensions d = 0, 1, 2, 3. The results are close to 1-loop predictions and deviations are consistent with 2-loop FRG. The most\nimportant feature, namely a linear cusp in \u2206(u) was clearly\nseen. These results come in strong support for the underlying hypothesis of a non-analytic field theory, perturbatively\naccessible in a d = 4 \u2212 \u01eb expansion.\nIn our Letter [60], we have extended the method of [56, 59]\nto driven systems. In particular it allows to measure the FRG\nfixed-point function \u2206\u2217 (u) near the depinning transition at velocity v = 0+ . The form of this fixed point was obtained to\none loop [42, 43], but the remarkable fact is that it is only\nto two loop order that it differs from the static fixed point\n[13, 40]. Shortly after, this tiny difference was measured, beyond statistical uncertainties, together with the predicted linear cusp, in a numerical study [61] of a line driven in a one\ndimensional medium.\nIn this situation, it is useful to find a simple model, which\ncan be solved analytically, and exhibits many features of the\nmore complicated situation. Such a model is a particle in a\nrandom force landscape, pulled by a moving spring. Since\nthere is no internal degree of freedom, it is the d = 0 limit\nof the depinning fixed point for interfaces. Similar d = 0\ntoy models were very useful in the study of the statics. The\nuniversality classes there were found to be parameterized by\nthe exponent \u03b6 \u2265 1, with a (presumably unique) universal fixed-point function \u2206(u) = \u2212R\u2032\u2032 (u) in each case, with\nR(u) \u223c |u|\u03b3 at large |u|, with \u03b3 = 4 \u2212 4/\u03b6. Only in some\ncases this function was obtained analytically, e.g. for the case\n\u03b6 = 4/3 of the Sinai model [56], which corresponds to the\nrandom-field disorder class. It is thus quite interesting to obtain the corresponding results for the depinning fixed point.\n\nOf course another application of the d = 0 model is driving\na fixed-size manifold over very large distance, it eventually\nbehaves again as a particle with some effective random force\nlandscape.\nThe aim of this paper is to give a detailed account of the\nresults summarized in [60], and to present some new ones.\nWe summarize the basic ideas in section II, relegating details\nof the field-theoretic derivation in appendix A.\nIn section III, we give a detailed derivation of the analytical\nresults for the d = 0 particle model, focussing there on uncorrelated random forces. This yields an exponent \u03b6 in a continuous range 0 < \u03b6 \u2264 2 with corresponding fixed-point functions\n\u2206(u) easier to compute than in the statics. The result depends\non the tail of the distribution of the local random force, i.e.\nwe find the three main universality classes of extreme value\nstatistics: The Gumbel, Weibull and Frechet distribution.\nIn section IV, we calculate analytically the joint avalanche\nsize s and waiting-time w distribution. The avalanche distribution was computed recently [62] in a d = 4 \u2212 \u01eb expansion using FRG, and the present results hence correspond to\nthe d = 0 limit. There it was shown how the avalanchedistribution is related to the non-analyticity of the set of all\ncumulants of the displacement field.\nInterestingly, the problem of a particle driven in one dimension is related to the so-called record statistics [73, 74].\nIf the particle is pulled by a spring the problem is related to\nrecord statistics for random sequences with linear trends [76],\nwhose interest has been revived in the context of global warming models [75]. Translated into the language of records, we\nobtain in Section IV, the joint distribution of the time s between two successive records and their difference in value, w,\nfor a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with trends, i.e. variables Yn = Xn + cn where Xn are i.i.d. random variables,\nand c a drift. These results are obtained for the three classes\nof extremal statistics.\nIn section V, we check some of our above results numerically; we also study numerically a particle driven at non-zero\nvelocity v > 0, and find that the velocity smoothens the cusp\nin the force correlator.\nIn section VI we consider long-range correlated random\nforce landscapes, specifically the case of a Brownian force.\nFor this model, known as the ABBM model for domain wall\nmotion, remarkably, the stationary distribution of instantaneous velocities can be computed [77] for any non-zero average driving velocity v > 0. From that we obtain \u2206(u) for any\nv > 0. We also compute the quasi-static \u2206(u) and avalanche\ndistribution. It matches with the limit v \u2192 0+ , and shows\nhow the cusp is smoothened at v > 0.\nIn section VII we summarize some known results and some\nnew ones, common to record statistics and to the present\nmodel of a driven particle, either with no mass (fixed-force\ndriving, symmetric records), or with a mass (fixed-velocity\ndriving, records with drifts). In particular we study in detail\nthe record statistics for a Levy-walk landscape with drift.\nFinally we address the outstanding question of the depinning for systems which can move in more than one direction,\nalso termed \"N > 1\", with N the number of components\nof the displacement field u (e.g. N = 2 for a line moving\n\n\f3\nin three dimension). In particular there is still no satisfactory field theoretic description for this case based on FRG.\nThis question was studied by Erta\u015f and Kardar [63], but they\nmade the approximation that the disorder correlator only depends on the direction in which the system is driven. Considering two manifolds which are driven on trajectories far apart\nin the transversal direction, their renormalized disorder correlators should be independent, questioning the assumptions in\nthe Erta\u015f-Kardar approach. We have studied this situation in\nthe field theory [66] (see also some study at v > 0 in [67]),\nbut consistent and stable solution of the fixed-point equations\nseem quite complicated and are still lacking. In this situation it is important to have some numerical results as guide\nfor the analytical treatment. In section VIII, we therefore discuss the changes necessary to study an elastic manifold driven\nthrough a higher-dimensional random environment, and complement this in section IX by a numerical study of a particle\ndragged through a random energy landscape. Especially, we\nshow numerically, that the scaling exponents (\"roughness\") in\nthe direction of the driving \u03b6x and perpendicular to it \u03b6y are\ndifferent, and satisfy \u03b6x > \u03b6y . We also find, that the crosscorrelator in the transversal direction (i.e. the force correlator between forces in the direction x of the driving, and its\ntransversal one y, measured as a function of the transversal\ndistance uy , \u2206xy (ux = 0, uy ), is non-vanishing.\nII.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE METHOD\nA.\n\nGeneral framework\n\nWe consider the equation of motion for the over-damped\ndynamics of an elastic manifold parameterized by its timedependent displacement field u(x, t):\n\u03b7\u2202t u(x, t) = Fx [u(t); w(t)]\n(1)\nFx [u; w] = m2 (w \u2212 u(x)) + c\u22072x u(x) + F (x, u(x))\nwhere Fx [u(t); w(t)] is the total force exerted on the manifold (we note u(t) = {u(x, t)}x\u2208Rd the manifold configuration, x being its d-dimensional internal coordinate); \u03b7 is the\nfriction coefficient and c the elastic constant. Here at the bare\nlevel, the random pinning force is F (x, u) = \u2212\u2202u V (x, u) and\nthe random potential V has correlations V (0, x)V (u, x\u2032 ) =\nR0 (u)\u03b4 d (x \u2212 x\u2032 ). We consider first random-bond bare disorder with a short-ranged R0 (u). We have added a harmonic\ncoupling to an external variable w(t), a given function of time\n(in most cases we choose it uniform in x). This is the simplest generalization of the statics, where w(t) = w is timeindependent. It is useful to define the fixed-w energy\nZ\nm2\nHw [u] = dd x\n(u(x) \u2212 w)2 + V (x, u(x))\n(2)\n2\nw [u]\nassociated to the force Fx [u; w] = \u2212 \u03b4H\n\u03b4u(x) . If w(t) is an increasing function of t the model represents an elastic manifold\n\"pulled\" by a spring.\nWe first describe qualitatively how to measure the FRG\nfunctions and later justify why the relation is expected to\n\nbe exact. We are interested\nin the observable w(t) \u2212 h\u016b(t)i\nR\nwhere \u016b(t) = L\u2212d dd xu(x, t) is the center of mass position, and h. . . i denotes thermal averages, i.e. the ground\nstate at zero temperature. It represents the shift between the\ntranslationally averaged displacement and the center of the\nwell, i.e. the extension of the spring. It is thus proportional\nto the pulling force on the manifold, hence to the translationally averaged pinning force\nR minus the friction force, i.e.\nw(t) \u2212 \u016b(t) = m\u22122 (\u03b7v(t) \u2212 x F (x, u(x, t))) (if we use periodic boundary conditions inside the manifold). Of particular\ninterest are:\nw(t) \u2212 h\u016b(t)i = m\u22122 fav (t)\n\n(3)\nc\n\n(w(t) \u2212 h\u016b(t)i)(w(t\u2032 ) \u2212 h\u016b(t\u2032 )i) = m\n\n\u22124\n\nL\n\n\u2212d\n\n\u2032\n\nDw (t, t )\n\nwhere connected means w.r.t. the double average h...i. If we\nconsider a function w(t) such that dw(t)/dt > 0, one can also\nwrite:\nDw (t, t\u2032 ) = \u2206w (w(t), w(t\u2032 ))\n\n(4)\n\nAs written, the function \u2206w may in general depend on the\nhistory w(t). However we expect that for fixed L, m and\nslow enough w(t), e.g. w(t) = vt with v \u2192 0+ , one\nhas \u2206w (w(t), w(t\u2032 )) \u2192 \u2206(w(t) \u2212 w(t\u2032 )). This function\n\u2206(w \u2212 w\u2032 ), which is independent of the process w(t), is the\none defined in the F.T.. The derivation of this property is given\nin Appendix A to which we refer the reader for technical details. Note that we are discussing now N = 1 systems (interfaces), subtleties related to N > 1 are discussed in section\nVIII.\nLet us now describe T = 0 depinning. Quasi-static depinning is studied as the limiting case where dw/dt \u2192 0+ .\nThe quasi-static motion can be described as follows (in the\ncontinuum model). One starts in a metastable state u0 (x) for\na given w = w0 , i.e. a zero-force state Fx (u0 (x); w) = 0\nwhich is a local minimum of Hw0 [u] with a positive barrier.\nOne then increases w. For smooth short-scale disorder, the\nresulting deformation of u(x) is smooth. At some w = w1 ,\nthe barrier vanishes. For w = w1+ the manifold moves downward in energy until it is blocked again in a metastable state\nu1 (x) which again is a local minimum of Hw1 [u]. We are\ninterested in the center ofR mass (i.e. translationally averaged)\ndisplacement \u016b = L\u2212d dd x u(x). The above process defines a function \u016b(w) which exhibits jumps at the set wi . Note\nthat time has disappeared: evolution is only used to find the\nnext location. The first two cumulants\nw \u2212 u(w) = m\u22122 fc\n(w \u2212\n\nu(w))(w\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\nc\nu(w\u2032 )\n\n(5)\n=m\n\n\u22124\n\nL\n\n\u2212d\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2206(w \u2212 w ) (6)\n\nallow a direct determination of the averaged (m-dependent)\ncritical force fc and of \u2206(w). Note that u(w) a priori depends on the initial condition and on its orbit but at fixed m\none expects an averaging effect when w is moved over a large\nregion. This is further discussed below. Note that the definition of the (finite size) critical force is very delicate in the\nthermodynamic limit [38].\n\n\f4\nElastic systems driven by a spring and stick-slip type motion were studied before, e.g. in the context of dry friction.\nThe force fluctuations, and jump distribution were studied numerically for a string driven in a random potential [64]. However, the precise connection to quantities defined and computed in the field theory has to our knowledge not been made.\nThe dependence in m for small m predicted by FRG, \u2206(w) =\n\u2212\u03b6\n \u0303\nm\u01eb\u22122\u03b6 \u2206(wm\n) is consistent with observations of [64] but\n \u0303\nthe resulting \u2206(w) has never been measured. Fully connected mean-field models of depinning also reduce to a particle pulled by a spring, together with some self-consistency\ncondition. Ref. [43] discusses related issues in an expansion\naround mean field. As discussed below, our main remarks\nhere are much more general, independent of any approximation scheme, and provide a rather simple and transparent way\nto attack the problem.\nNote that the manifold in the harmonic well can be approximated by (L/Lm)d roughly independent pieces with\nLm \u223c 1/m. The motion of each piece over large distances\nresembles the one of a particle, i.e. a d = 0 model, but with a\nrescaled unit of distance in the u direction, um \u223c L\u03b6m \u223c m\u2212\u03b6 .\nThe \"effective force\" landscape seen by each piece becomes\nuncorrelated on such distances, and its amplitude scales as\nFm \u223c m2 um . Hence one is in a bulk regime not dominated\nby extremes, i.e. \u2206(w) probes only motion over order one\nunit. It is easy to check that an arbitrary initial condition joins\nthe common unique orbit after about one correlation length.\nHence the d = 0 model suggests that starting the quasi-static\nmotion in u0 and driving the manifold over w \u223c L\u03b6m should\nthen result in all orbits either converging or having statistically\nidentical properties. Note that if the manifold is driven over\nmore than L\u03b6 , a crossover to d = 0 behavior and extremal\nstatistics occurs, as studied in the next Section.\nThe averaged critical force, defined in (5), should, for d >\n0, go to a finite limit, with fc (m) = fc\u221e + Bm2\u2212\u03b6 from finite\nsize scaling. This has been recently tested in the numerics\n[61]. Although fc is not universal and depends on short-scale\ndetails, one easily sees that \u2212m\u2202m fc (m) depends only on one\nunknown scale. We note that the definition (5) coincides with\nthe one proposed recently as the maximum depinning force\nfor all configurations having the same center of mass u0 [38].\nSince \u016b\u2212w is a fluctuating variable of order (L/Lm )\u2212d/2 , the\ntwo definitions should coincide in the limit where L \u2192 \u221e,\nbefore m \u2192 0. The one point distribution of the critical force\nis obtained from the distribution of w \u2212 u(w), and to one loop\nis identical to the one obtained in [38] provided one uses there\nthe massive scheme.\nLet us now recall the field-theory predictions: The FRG\nequation at 2-loop order for the (rescaled) force correlator are\n[13]:\n\n\u2206(u)\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\nRF\n0.4\n0.2\n\nRB\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nu\n\n-0.2\n\nFIG. 3: Fixed-point functions \u2206\u2217 (u) for random-bond (RB) and\nrandom-field (RF) disorder (arbitrary scale).\n\nF(u)\n\nw\n\nu\n\nu(w)\n\nFIG. 4: Construction of u(w) in d = 0, for the pinning force F (u)\n(bold black line). The two quasi-static motions driven to the right and\nto the left are indicated by red and green arrows, and exhibit jumps\n(\"dynamical shocks\"). The position of the shocks in the statics is\nshown for comparison, based on the Maxwell construction (equivalence of light blue and yellow areas, both bright in black and white).\nThe critical force is 1/(2M ) times the area bounded by the hull of\nthe construction.\n\n\u03bb = \u22121 describes the statics, and \u03bb = 1 the depinning. For\nthe statics, \u2206(u) admits a potential solution (random-bond\nuniversality class) \u2206(u) = \u2212R\u2032\u2032 (u), with R(u) decaying to 0\nas u \u2192R \u221e, as illustrated on figure 3. This implies that the in\u221e\ntegral 0 du \u2206(u) remains unrenormalized. However at depinning, it flows, and no potential solution exists. For a large\nclass of bare disorder, the model should renormalize, as m\ndecreases, to the random-field fixed-point solution, \u2206\u2217RF (u),\nwhich is monotonically decaying and strictly positive. For the\nd = 0 toy-model discussed in the next section, this crossover\nis nicely seen in our numerical simulation with decreasing m,\nas is illustrated on figure 2. Therefore, in the following, we\ncan focus on the random-field universality class, i.e. shortrange correlated random forces.\n\nIII.

The vertical lines are the force barriers, the (red)\nincreasing lines the spring force m2 (u \u2212 w). A particle moves from\nleft to right, until it is stopped by a barrier (when the lines for spring\nforce and barrier forces intersect).\n\nIn the quasi-static limit where w is increased slower than\nany other time-scale in the problem, the zero force condition\nF (u) = m2 (u \u2212 w) determines u(w) for each w, starting\nfrom some initial condition. The graphical construction of\nu(w) is well known from studies of dry friction [? ]. When\nthere are several roots one must follow the root as indicated in\nFig. 4, where F (u) is plotted versus m2 (u \u2212 w). This results\nin jumps and different paths, u\u2191 (w) and u\u2193 (w) respectively\nfor motion to the right (forward) and to the left (backward).\nLet us call A the area of this hysteresis loop (the area of all\ncolored/shaded regions in Fig.4). It is the total work of the\nfriction force when moving the center of the harmonic well\nquasi-statically once forth and back, i.e. the total dissipated\nenergy. The above definition of the averaged critical force (5),\nassuming the landscape statistics to be translationally invariant and that one can replace disorder averages by translational\nones over a large width M (which certainly holds if force correlations are short-range correlated), gives\nm2\nfc = m (w \u2212 uw ) =\nM\n\nZ\n\ntr\n\n2\n\nM\n\n0\n\ndw (w \u2212 uw )\n\n(9)\n\nHence, subtracting the two paths gives\nm2\n1\nfc := (fc\u2191 \u2212 fc\u2193 ) = lim\nM\u2192\u221e 2M\n2\nA\n= lim\nM\u2192\u221e 2M\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nPw (j, F ) := Prob u(w) = j\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u0001\ndw u (w) \u2212 u (w)\n\nand Fj = F\n\n\u0001\n\n(11)\n\u0010\nPw;w\u2032 (j, F ; j , F ) := Prob u(w) = j and Fj = F\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0011\nand u(w\u2032 ) = j \u2032 and Fj \u2032 = F \u2032 (12)\n\nWe define:\nH(F ) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nP (f )df = 1 \u2212\n\nF\n\nF\n\nZ\n\nP (f )df\n\n(13)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nSince for u(w) = j to hold, one must have all Fk > m2 (k\u2212\nw) for all k < j and Fj < m2 (j \u2212 w), see Fig. 5, one has:\n\nM\n\n(10)\n\nR\n\nLet us now consider the asymptotic forward process\nu(w) := u\u2191 (w), defined in general as the smallest root of\nthe equation F (u) = m2 (u \u2212 w). The set of points (u, F (u))\nis the lightened portion of the F (u) curve, the rest being the\nshadow. If one starts in the shadow at w0 one joins at w1 the\nasymptotic process for all w > w1 . The difference w1 \u2212 w0\nis finite for finite m hence we will only study the asymptotic\nprocess. Note that the area of the shadow per unit length is the\ncritical force.\nWe now study short-range correlated random force landscapes. In the limit of interest, m \u2192 0, the scale of jumps\nbecomes large, and the finite range should be unimportant.\nHence it is equivalent, and more convenient, to consider a discrete model, u being integers. The variable w can be kept real.\nOne considers a discrete landscape F (u) = Fi independently\ndistributed with P (F ), and i integer variable. The process\nu(w) is then defined on integers. Its definition is shown in\nFig. 5.\nLet us compute for w\u2032 > w the following joint probabilities:\n\nPw (j, F ) = P (F )\u03b8(m2 (j \u2212 w) \u2212 F )\n\nwhere we have used u dw = w du and fc\u2193 < 0. One\ncan check that for m \u2192 0 this definition of fc becomes\nidentical to the one on a cylinder, fd , which for a particle\n(d = 0) is 2fd = fd\u2191 \u2212 fd\u2193 = maxu F (u) \u2212 minu F (u) with\n2fd M = limm\u21920 A(m). Since A depends on the starting\npoint, this definition holds after a complete tour, where the\nmaximum (minimal) pinning force was selected. One can also\ncompare with the definition of shocks in the statics. There, the\neffective potential is a continuous function of w. Therefore,\nwhen making a jump, the integral over the force must be zero,\nwhich amounts to the Maxwell construction of figure 4.\nR\n\nShort-range correlated force: a discrete model\n\n\u0001\nPw (j) = 1 \u2212 H(m2 (j \u2212 w))\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nH(m2 (k \u2212 w))\n\nH(m2 (k \u2212 w)) , (14)\n\nwhere the first line integrated over F yields the second (and\n\u03b8(x) denotes the unit step function).

One then finds the Gumbel distribution for the critical force, hence we call this class the Gumbel class.\n\n\f7\nLet us invert relation (27) and assume that the following\nexpansion holds at small m:\n\nOne also finds\n\u03c1m =\n\n1\n\u2212 ln a)\nm2\nln a\n= \u2212fc0 (m) \u2212 \u2032\n\u03b2 (\u2212fc0 (m))\n1 (ln a)2\n+ ...\n+ (\u03b2 \u22121 )\u2032\u2032 (ln 2 )\nm\n2\n1\nfc0 (m) := \u2212b\u22121 (m2 ) \u2261 \u2212\u03b2 \u22121 (ln 2 )\nm\n\nm2 (j \u2212 w) = \u03b2 \u22121 (ln\n\n(\u03b2 \u22121 )\u2032 (ln m\u22122 )\n1\n=\n1 .\n1\n2\nm2\n\u03b3A \u03b3 m (ln m\u22122 )1\u2212 \u03b3\n\nSince as confirmed below, \u03c1m \u223c m\u2212\u03b6 is the unique scale\nappearing also in the second cumulant (the disorder correlator\ndefined in FRG), we can identify for class Ia:\n(29)\n\nm\u2212\u03b6 = m\u22122 (ln m\u22122 ) \u03b3 \u22121 .\n\n(30)\n\nHence \u03b6 = 2, with additional logarithmic corrections, i.e. \u03b6 =\n2+ for \u03b3 < 1 and \u03b6 = 2\u2212 for \u03b3 > 1.\n\nwhere we know that a is a fluctuating number of order one\nwith an exponential distribution, P (a) = e\u2212a \u03b8(a). That gives\nthe distribution of the variable m2 (j \u2212 w).

An example is ln P (f ) =\n\u2212A(\u2212f )\u03b3 as f \u2192 \u2212\u221e.

One sees that the condition (33) is obeyed. Hence\nthis is still the Gumbel class, although we introduce a distinction for convenience. A similar asymptotics can then be performed:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u03b31\nA\nln a\n1 1\n2\nm (j \u2212 w) = \u2212x0 +\n+ A\u03b3\n1\n\u22122\nln m\n\u03b3\n(ln m\u22122 )1+ \u03b3\n(46)\nApart from the bound x0 , the result is the same as in class I\nwith \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3 (in the exponents only). Hence one finds again:\nfc (m) = fc0 (m) + cm2 \u03c1m\n\n(36)\n\nHence class-Ia condition is satisfied for any \u03b3, even for \u03b3 < 1.\nNote that pre-exponential algebraic factors to not change the\nresult.

An example is\nP (f ) = \u00c3(f + x0 )\u03b1\u0303 \u03b8(f + x0 )\nb(x) = A(x + x0 )\u03b1 \u03b8(x + x0 )\n\u03b1 = 2 + \u03b1\u0303\nA = \u00c3/[(2 + \u03b1\u0303)(1 + \u03b1\u0303)] .\n\n(50)\n(51)\n(52)\n(53)\n\n\f8\nOne must have \u03b1\u0303 > \u22121 hence \u03b1 > 1. The box distribution\ncorresponds to \u03b1\u0303 = 0, i.e. \u03b1 = 2. Here\nb\u22121 (y) = \u2212x0 + (y/A)1/\u03b1\n\n(54)\n\nwith y \u2265 0. Hence analogously to (29) and (30) we find from\n(27)\nm2 (u(w) \u2212 w) = m2 (j \u2212 w) = b\u22121 (m2 a)\n\u0012 2 \u00131/\u03b1\nm\na1/\u03b1 ,\n= \u2212x0 +\nA\n\nwhere now c = a\u22121/\u03b1 has a Frechet distribution P (c) =\n\u03b1c\u2212\u03b1\u22121 exp(\u2212c\u2212\u03b1 ) with parameter \u03b1 > 0 on the positive\nreal axis c \u2208]0, \u221e[ and the average critical force is:\nfc (m) = \u0393(1 \u2212\nwhere we have used c =\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\n1 2\n)m \u03c1m\n\u03b1\n\nda e\u2212a a\u22121/\u03b1 = \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b11 ), and\n1\n\n\u03c1m = A1/\u03b1 m\u22122(1+ \u03b1 ) .\n(55)\n\nwhere we recall that a is a random variable with distribution P (a) = e\u2212a \u03b8(a). For \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e one recovers the Gumbel class. Hence one finds for the fluctuating critical force\nfc (m) = m2 (u(w) \u2212 w) = m2 (j \u2212 w):\nfc (m) = fc0 (m) + cm2 \u03c1m\n\n(56)\n\nwhere now c = \u2212a1/\u03b1 has a Weibull distribution P (c) =\n\u03b1(\u2212c)\u03b1\u22121 exp(\u2212(\u2212c)\u03b1 ) with parameter \u03b1 on the negative\nreal axis c \u2208] \u2212 \u221e, 0[ and\nfc0 (m) = x0 .\n\n(57)\n\n(63)\n\n(64)\n\nThis corresponds to a roughness exponent\n\u03b6 =2+\n\n2\n.\n\u03b1\n\n(65)\n\nNote that for \u03b1 < 1 (\u03b1\u0303 < 3, \u03b6 > 4) the average critical force\nis infinite.\nWe will see that the Frechet class is a bit pathologic in the\nsense that \u2206(0) = \u221e for \u03b1 < 2. More generally cumulants\nof order larger than \u03b1 are infinite, i.e. they are associated to\na probability distribution with fat tails. This implies as usual\nthat these quantities are dominated by the largest events, hence\nthey are sensitive to how the continuous limit is constructed\nfrom the discrete model. For \u03b1\u0303 < 2 the integral in (28) is\ndivergent at its lower bound, hence undefined without a cutoff.\n\nThe averaged critical force is\n5.\n\n\u0012 \u00131/\u03b1\n1\n1\n2\nfc (m) = x0 \u2212\nm \u03b1 \u0393(1 + ) + . . . ,\nA\n\u03b1\nwhere we have used that\nalso finds that\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nda e\u2212a a1/\u03b1 = \u0393(1 +\n1\n\n\u03c1m = A\u22121/\u03b1 m\u22122(1\u2212 \u03b1 )\n2\n\u03b6 =2\u2212\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\u03b1 ).\n\n(58)\nOne\n\n(59)\n(60)\n\nwith 1 < \u03b1 < \u221e, hence 0 < \u03b6 < 2.\n4.\n\nFr\u00e9chet class (class II)\n\nThe Fr\u00e9chet class, or class II, is relevant for force distributions with large fluctuations, i.e. algebraic tails on an unbounded support. An example is P (f ) \u2248 \u00c3(\u2212f )\u2212\u03b1\u0303 \u0398(\u2212f ),\n\u03b1\u0303 > 1. One has b(x) = A(\u2212x)\u2212\u03b1 with \u03b1 = \u03b1\u0303 \u2212 2 and\n\u00c3 = A(\u03b1\u0303 \u2212 2)(\u03b1\u0303 \u2212 1). Since \u03b2(x) = \u2212 ln A + \u03b1 ln(\u2212x) and\n\u03b2 \u22121 (y) \u223c \u2212ey/\u03b1 one checks that the class-I condition (33) is\nnot fulfilled. Let us first study \u03b1\u0303 > 2, i.e. \u03b1 > 0:\nm2 (j \u2212 w) = \u2212A1/\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nm2 a\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n(61)\n\nHence one finds for the fluctuating critical force fc (m) =\nm2 (u(w) \u2212 w) = m2 (j \u2212 w):\nfc (m) = cm2 \u03c1m\n\n(62)\n\nComparison with extremal statistics\n\nUntil now it seems that we have recovered the standard extremal statistics classes for the distribution of the local critical\nforce. On one hand this is not surprising, since one expects,\nqualitatively, that the critical force for two independent consecutive regions in one dimension, be the maximum of the\nones for each single region. This is certainly an exact statement for the zero-mass case recalled in Section VII. Here, it\nis quite consistent with the identification of m2 (u(w) \u2212 w)\nas a fluctuating threshold force, a fact which maybe was not\nobvious from the start. However, note that the value of the\nparameter \u03b1 of the extremal statistics classes is shifted by one\nfrom the value it takes if one models the total critical force as\nthe extremal one fc = mini ({fci }) over N \u223c m\u22122 independent regions, each with its critical force fci distributed with\nPc (f ). In that case one has:\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015N\nRx\nProba(fc > x) =\nPc (f )\n\u2248 e\u2212N \u2212\u221e Pc (f ) (66)\nx\n\nwhich can be written equivalently as:\nZ x\na\nbc (x) :=\nPc (f )df =\nN\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(67)\n\nwhere a is a random variable of order one with an exponential\ndistribution, P (a) = e\u2212a \u03b8(a). A comparison with (28) shows\nthat the effective critical force in an independent region should\nbe chosen with a distribution with a tail:\nZ f\nPc (f ) =\nP (f \u2032 )df \u2032\n(68)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\f9\nfor large negative f . Hence there is a first coarse graining\nwhich transforms the tail of P (f ) into the tail of Pc (f ). Then\none can think of the resulting critical force as the maximum\nover N \u223c m\u22122 independent random variables distributed\nwith Pc (f ). Applied to Weibull and Frechet classes, (68) indeed accounts for the shift of the index \u03b1 by one.\nD. 2-point probabilities and the FRG correlator \u2206(w)\n\nIn addition to recovering the three extremal statistics\nclasses, which, as explained above, is not surprising if one\nthinks in terms of coarse grained independent random variables, there is a second, more remarkable property. We find\nhere that the 2-point correlation\nc\n\n(w \u2212 u(w))(w\u2032 \u2212 u(w\u2032 ))\nZ\n= dj dj \u2032 Pw,w\u2032 (j, j \u2032 )(w \u2212 j)(w\u2032 \u2212 j) \u2212 (w \u2212 j) (w\u2032 \u2212 j \u2032 )\n= m\u22124 \u2206(w \u2212 w\u2032 )\n\n(69)\n\ntakes, for all three classes, the following form at small m:\n \u0303\n\u2206(w) = m4 \u03c12m \u2206(w/\u03c1\nm) ,\n\n(70)\n\nwhere the scale \u03c1m \u223c m\u2212\u03b6 is the one identified in each case in\n \u0303\nthe previous section, and the fixed-point function \u2206(w)\nonly\ndepends on the universality class: it is unique and identical for\nall members of class I (Ia and Ib), continuously depending on\n\u03b1 (hence \u03b6) for classes II and III.\nLet us now give the joint probability in the continuum limit.\nFrom (18) and as was done to arrive to (23) one finds for w\u2032 >\nw:\nPw;w\u2032 (j, j \u2032 ) = [a\u2032w (j) \u2212 a\u2032w\u2032 (j)] a\u2032w\u2032 (j \u2032 )\n\u00d7e\u2212aw (j)\u2212aw\u2032 (j\n\n\u2032\n\n)+aw\u2032 (j)\n\n(71)\n\u03b8(j \u2032 > j)\n\nus check the normalizations.\nUsing that\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2212aw\u2032 (j \u2032 )\n\u2212aw\u2032 (j)\ndj\na\n(j\n)e\n=\ne\none\nobtains\n(writ\u2032\nw\nj\ning separately the two contributions):\nZ \u221e\ndj \u2032 Pw;w\u2032 (j, j \u2032 )\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(72)\n\n(73)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\nPw;w (j, j ) = Pw (j)\u03b4(j \u2212 j) .\n\n(74)\n\nFor all three classes one finds, starting from (37), (56) and\n(62) respectively\nj\u2212w =\u2212\n\nfc0 (m)\n\u2212 \u03c1m c(a) ,\nm2\n\n1.\n\nCalculation of \u2206(w) for class I\n\nWe define a1 := aw (j), a2 := aw\u2032 (j), a3 := aw\u2032 (j \u2032 ).\nGiven the previous remark to compute the cumulants we can\nset\nj \u2212 w = ln a1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nj \u2212 w = ln a3\n\n,\n,\n\nj \u2212 w\u2032 = ln a2\n\na2 /a1 = e\n\n\u2212W\n\n(78)\n,\n\n(79)\n\nwhere we denote W = w\u2032 \u2212 w > 0.

Waiting-time distribution\n\nUsing the method introduced in the previous section, see\nespecially Eq. (21) ff., one finds that the continuum limit for\nthe probability Pw (j; w\u2032 ) is\nPw (j; w\u2032 )dj = daw\u2032 (j)e\u2212aw (j) ,\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nH(m (p + j \u2212 w ))(\u2212\u2202w\u2032 Pw (j; w ))\n\nand we use again the notation a1 = aw (j) and a2 = aw\u2032 (j).\n\n(127)\n\nand of course Pw (j, w\u2032 , S = 0) = \u2212\u2202w\u2032 Pw (j; w\u2032 ), i.e. the\nprobability that u(w) = j and that the next avalanche occurs\nat w\u2032 (per unit dw\u2032 ). Of particular interest is:\nX\nPw (j, w\u2032 , S)\n(128)\nPw (w\u2032 , s > S) :=\nj\n\n= Proba(next avalanche is in [w\u2032 , w\u2032 + dw\u2032 ]\nand of size s > S )\n\nThis is illustrated on figure 7.\nWe now consider the limit m \u2192 0 in which the continuum limit can be used, and extract the distributions of waiting\ntimes and avalanche sizes. We find that they depend on the\nsame single scale \u03c1m as defined in the previous Sections. The\nwaiting time distribution is denoted below P (w) (and sometimes P (W )), and has thus the scaling form:\nP (w) = \u03c1\u22121\nm P\u0303 (w/\u03c1m )\n\n(129)\n\nHowever, to simplify notations, unless specified, we drop below the tilde on P\u0303 and formally replace \u03c1m \u2192 1 (formally,\nsince all statements below are about scaling forms in the limit\nm \u2192 0). When no confusion is possible we use the symbol w for either the argument of u(w) and the waiting time\nw = wi \u2212 wi\u22121 , and use W for the waiting time when confusion is possible. Similarly the avalanche size distribution is\nloosely noted with the same symbol:\nP (s) = \u03c1\u22121\nm P\u0303 (s/\u03c1m )\n\n(130)\n\nand we perform the same simplification in notations, and similarly for the joint distribution. The dependence on \u03c1m can be\nrestored by replacing in the final formulas\nj\nj\u2192\n\u03c1m\nw\nw\u2192\n\u03c1m\n\n(133)\n\n1.\n\nClass I (Gumbel)\n\nWe recall (75) for class I\nj \u2212 w = \u2212fc0 + ln a1\nj \u2212 w\u2032 = \u2212fc0 + ln a2\n\n(134)\n\nwhere fc0 is a non-fluctuating constant, and as in (79) a2 =\ne\u2212W a1 . Thus one finds:\nPw (j; w\u2032 )dj = e\u2212W da1 e\u2212a1\n\n(135)\n\nIntegrating over a1 in [0, \u221e[ one obtains\n\u2032\n\nPw (w\u2032 ) = \u03b8(w\u2032 \u2212 w) ew\u2212w .\n\n(136)\n\nFrom (136) we can infer the distribution P (W ) of waiting times W . Since the probability that a uniformly chosen w on Rthe real axis falls in an interval of size W is\nW P (W )/ d W W P (W ) (see figure 8), and that then the\nprobability of of w\u2032 \u2212 w is uniform, i.e. \u03b8(0 < w\u2032 \u2212 w <\nW )/W , multiplying the two expressions one finds the general relation:\nR\u221e\ndW P (W )\n\u2032\nRw\u221e\u2212w\n= Pw (w\u2032 ) .\n(137)\ndW\nW\nP\n(W\n)\n0\n\nThis is true only in the small-m limit (because of uniform\nmeasure assumption). For any member of class I we find the\ndistribution of \"waiting time\" W (restoring the dependence\non \u03c1m ):\n\u2212W/\u03c1m\nP (W ) = \u03c1\u22121\nm e\n\n(138)\n\n2.

We remind that\nin order to include \u03c1m , S gets rescaled as j and w.\n1.\n\nClass I (Gumbel)\n\nConsider now class I. In addition to (134) one has\nj + S \u2212 w\u2032 = \u2212fc0 + ln a3 .\n\n(155)\n\nHence we have a2 = e\u2212W a1 and a3 = e\u2212W \u2212S a1 where\nPw (j, w\u2032 , S)dj = [\u2212\u2202w\u2032 e\u2212W (da1 e\u2212a1 )]e\u2212a1 e\n\n\u2212W\n\n(eS \u22121)\n\n\u0001\n= e\u2212W da1 exp \u2212 a1 [1 + e\u2212W (eS \u2212 1)]\n(156)\nIntegrating over j and a1 respectively, we obtain the joint distribution:\n1\nPw (w\u2032 , s > S) = \u03b8(w\u2032 \u2212 w) w\u2032 \u2212w\n(157)\ne\n+ eS \u2212 1\n\nAgain this is the probability that if one observes the system\nat w, the next avalanche occurs at w\u2032 and has size s > S.\nThis allows to find the joint probability P + (W, s > S) that\nwn+1 \u2212 wn = W and the next avalanche is sn+1 > S (see\nAppendix V for further notations and definitions). Indeed one\nhas, by the same reasoning as above [94]:\nR\u221e\ndW P + (W, s > S)\nw \u2032 \u2212w\nR\u221e\n= Pw (w\u2032 , s > S)\n(158)\n+ (W, 0)\ndW\nW\nP\n0\nThis yields for class I:\n\n\u22121/\u03b1\n\nj \u2212 w = \u2212a1\n\nUsing the variable y > 0 such that a1\ny + W one now finds from (133):\n\nC.

W reproduces the waitingtime distribution (138). We thus obtain that the avalanche exponent, such that P (s) \u223c s\u2212\u03c4 at small 1 \u226a s \u226a \u03c1m , is here\n\u03c4 = 0.

For large S, the decay\nof (172) is P (s > S) \u223c P (S) \u223c exp(\u2212S \u03b1 ), i.e. a stretched\nexponent decay with exponent \u03b4 = \u03b1. Next, one checks that\nthe general relation involving the cusp is obeyed:\n\n \u0303 \u2032 (0+ ) = \u22121 from (87).

Red = data with error-bars. Blue = analytic solution (96) for \u03b1 = 3. The other parameters used in (50)\nff. are: \u00c3 = 1/\u03b3 and \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b31 \u2212 1. We have chosen \u03b3 = 1/2\nas an example, hence \u03b1\u0303 = 1, \u03b1 = 3, \u00c3 = 2, A = 13 . We use\nm2 = 0.0001, with 107 disorder points. One finds fc /m2 : \u2212599.8\n(numerics) versus \u2212597.79 (analytic).

This explains why the various classes are very close on figure\n13.\n\nthe force. i.e. the r.h.s. of equation (8) is positive. The point at\nwhich we stop defines u(w). We then update w \u2192 w+1. This\nis an approximation to the process defined in section III A, but\nsince jumps as well as waiting times diverge when m \u2192 0,\nthe scaling limit is the same. A second algorithm, described\nin Appendix C, was used to independently compute P (w) and\nP (s) (not shown), and check the present results.\n\nB. \u2206(w)\n\nWe have shown on figures 10, 11, and 12, comparisons between the numerically computed functions \u2206(u), and the analytical predictions. The corresponding analytical results are\nreferenced in the corresponding captions. Hence there is no\n\nadjustable parameter in figures 10 to 12 and the agreement is\nexcellent.\nAn general important question at depinning is whether the\nrandom bond class (i.e. uncorrelated potentials) flows to the\nrandom field one (uncorrelated forces). This appears clearly\nin figure 13, where we plot the rescaled (as explained in the\ncaption) \u2206(u), for the 3 disorders P1 (f ), P2 (f ), and P3 (f ),\ndefined in (193) ff. The cross-over as the mass decreases from\nRB disorder to RF disorder can also nicely be seen in our simulations, presented on figure 2. One expects that the random\nshort-ranged energy model, i.e. fi = ei \u2212 ei+1 with ei distributed with PRRB (e) should flow to the random force model\nwith P (f ) = e PRB (f + e)PRB (e), i.e. the convolution of\nPRB (e) and PRB (\u2212e). This is because the rare large forces\nare isolated and become uncorrelated. This predicts that the\nbox distribution for e should flow to the \u03b1 = 3 class III.\nWe have seen on Fig. 13 that the shapes of the correlator\nfunctions \u2206(u) (i.e. their rescaled form as explained in the\ncaption) are rather similar for the various universality classes,\nwhile their unrescaled forms are very different. These rescaled\nforms obtained from the analytical calculations are compared\nin Fig. 14.\n\nC. Shocks and Avalanches\n\nIn figure 1 we have shown the avalanches, also called dynamical shocks: As a function of w, we plot w \u2212 uw (minus\nits average), for different masses. First consider the smallest\nmass, m2 = 0.03. We see that w \u2212 uw is growing linearly\nwith w, before it jumps. The linear parts are those, at which\nthe particle is localized by a large disorder force, before jumping (in zero time at \u03b7v = 0) to a new position (vertical parts).\n\n\f19\n\u2206(u)\n\nWhen decreasing the mass, we see that the linear parts, i.e.\nthe \"time\" (i.e. distance in w) between jumps, as well as the\njumps itself become larger, while sharing parts of their trajectories. This can be interpreted as merging of the (dynamical)\nshocks.\nIn figure 15 we show the avalanche-size and waiting-time\ndistributions for P (f ) being the box distribution. It clearly\nshows that avalanche-size and waiting-times distributions are\nidentical, as follows for all disorder classes from (D3). Moreover, the result is in agreement with the parameter free prediction of eq. (172), using \u03c1m defined in equation (59).\n\n100\n\nIn this section, we consider the equation of motion at finite\nvelocity v, or rather at finite \u03b7v, since the latter is the parameter entering all equations.\nThe algorithm for finite \u03b7v is as follows: We generalize\nthe position ut \u2261 u(wt ) of the point to now take non-integer\nvalues. It follows the Langevin equation\n\u03b7\n\nd\nut = f[ut ] + m2 (ut \u2212 wt )\ndt\n\n(197)\n\n[u] := largest integer \u2264 u .\n\n(198)\n\nwhere\n\nCondition (198) reflects that the disorder only changes at discrete values of u.\nIn practice, we discretize (197) with a step-size \u03b4t = 1/100,\nintegrating this discretized equation of motion in time following the It\u00f4 scheme, and using wt = vt.\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b7 [ut+\u03b4t \u2212 ut ] = \u03b4t f[ut ] + m2 (ut \u2212 wt )\n(199)\nTo guarantee that our time discretization is fine enough, we\nreport \"maxslide\", the maximum of (199) encountered in a\nsimulation. For the simulation shown on figure 16, this was\n0.05. The figure shows \u2206(u) at \u03b7v = 0, calculated with the\ndiscrete algorithm used in the previous sections, and \u2206(u) at\n\u03b7 = 1, and v = 0.2. The microscopic disorder is a box distribution for the force, given by eq. (193). The result clearly\nshows a rounding of the cusp by the non-zero velocity.\n\n\u03b7v = 0\n\nLONG-RANGE CORRELATED FORCES\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n-4\n-6\n\n80\n\n-8\n\n60\n40\n\n-10\n\n\u03b7v = 0.2\n\n20\nu\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFIG. 16: Rounding of \u2206(u) through a finite velocity; \u03b7v = 0.2.\nInset: \u2206\u2032 (u). The disorder distribution is P (f ) = \u0398(0 \u2264 f \u2264 1),\nm2 = 0.003.\n\nAlthough in most cases random-force landscapes at depinning\nhave short-ranged correlations, these more exotic LR landscapes exhibit some interesting properties. Note that in the\nstatics the (very) LR correlated random potential landscape\ncorresponding to the case \u03b3 = 1 was studied by Sinai [71]. It\nwas found that shocks are dense there.\nQuite remarkably, exact results can be obtained for this\nmodel for any non-zero velocity v > 0, as first noticed by\nAlessandro, Beatrice, Bertotti and Montorsi [77] who introduced this model, hence referred to as ABBM model, as a\nrealistic description of the Barkhausen effect in metallic ferromagnets, and compared the results to experiments. The mass\nterm originates from the magnetostatic fields: the demagnetizing field (resulting from the effective monopoles sitting at\nthe end of the sample) provides a long-ranged restoring force\nwhich acts as a spring, precisely as in the model considered in\nthis paper (see also discussions in [79] and [78]).\nWe first obtain some results on the quasi-static model, then\nwe recall some results of the ABBM analysis at v > 0, and\nobtain from it the renormalized correlator at non-zero velocity.\n\u03c6(u)\n10 000\n\n8000\n\navalanche, S = 3785\n\n6000\n\nVI.\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\nD.

The system is discretized\nwith stepsize 1 in u direction.\n\n\f20\nWe then discuss how these results match at v \u2192 0+ .\n\n2.\n\nA. Quasi-static motion\n\nThe forward process u = u(w) is defined as the smallest\nroot of\n\u03c6(u) = u \u2212 m\u22122 F (u) = w .\n\n(201)\n\nFor \u03b3 = 1 the process \u03c6(u) is a Brownian motion (BM) of\ndiffusion constant D = \u03c3/m4 and upward drift b = 1. The\ntime of the Brownian is t \u2261 u. From Fig. 17 one sees that it\nbecomes a first-passage-time problem, i.e. u = u(w) is the\nfirst time the process \u03c6(u) reaches altitude w. Conversely\nthe process w(u) = maxu\u2032 \u2264u \u03c6(u\u2032 ), is the maximum position over all previous times reached by a brownian motion.\nTo avoid pathologies we assume a cutoff which makes F (u)\nsmooth at very short scales; equivalently we can discretize in\nu-direction, as was done to generate figure 17. In Appendix\nE we have collected some useful properties of first-passage\ntimes and maxima of the Brownian motion that we now use\nextensively. We refer to this Appendix for all details.\n\nIt turns out that the 1-point-probability and critical-force\ndistribution is a subtle issue for this model, due to the longrange nature of the landscape and the choice of boundary conditions. We do not discuss it in details here, but some considerations are given in the Appendix F. A full solution requires\na separate study.\nWe can still offer some simple remarks. If we know, e.g.\nby observation in a numerical simulation or an experiment,\nthat the process is such that u(w1 ) = w1 , then one can easily\ncompute, from the Markov property of Brownian motion, the\nprobabilities of all future events, i.e. the conditional probability for u(w2 ), . . . , u(wn ) with w1 < w2 < . . . < wn :\n(205)\nPw2 ,..wn (u2 , .., un |u(w1 ) = u1 ) =\nP (u2 \u2212 u1 ; w2 \u2212 w1 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 P (un \u2212 un\u22121 ; wn \u2212 wn\u22121 )\nwhere P (u; w) is the first-passage-time probability defined in\n(E7). Computing the moments one finds:\nu(wn ) \u2212 wn = u(w1 ) \u2212 w1\n\n[u(wn ) \u2212 wn \u2212 u(wp ) \u2212 wp\n\n1. Avalanche distribution\n\nFrom Fig. 17 one sees that the avalanche distribution P (s)\nidentifies with the return probability to the origin of the BM\nwith a drift b = 1 and diffusion constant D = \u03c3/m4 .\nP (s) \u2248 P (s; W0 )\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\n1/2\ns0\ns0\ns\ns0\n= \u221a\n,\n\u2212\ns\u22123/2 exp \u2212\n+\n2 \u03c0\n4sm 4s\n4sm\n(202)\n\nwhere u = s, P (u; W ) is defined in (E7), b = 1 and D =\n\u03c3/m4 . W0 is a non-universal short-distance scale. We have\ndefined s0 := W02 /D and sm := D the short-scale and largescale cutoffs for the avalanche size. In the limit of small m\none has s0 \u226a sm , allowing to drop the last term in (202).\nThere are many small avalanches of the order of s0 , i.e. the\ndistribution is concentrated at s0 . However the moments hsp i\nfor p > 1/2 are dominated by large avalanches. For s \u226b s0\none has:\nhsi\n1 \u2212s/(4sm )\nP (s) = \u221a\ne\n3/2\n2 \u03c0sm s\nsm = D = \u03c3m\u22124\n\n(203)\n(204)\n\n\u221a\nand hsi = sm s0 . This is exactly the distribution found in the\nmean-field theory of sandpiles [80] and of the random-field\nIsing model, and was recently shown to hold, using FRG [62,\n84], for elastic manifolds in d = 4. The random-walk picture\ngoes back to the so-called Galton process [83] for survival of\nfamily names (see [81] for a recent discussion in the context\nof depinning) which exhibits the same mean-field power-law\nbehavior at the threshold.\n\n2-point conditional distribution\n\n]2\n\nc\n\n= 2D|wn \u2212 wp |\n2\u03c3\n= 4 |wn \u2212 wp |\nm\n\n(206)\n\n(207)\n\nfor any n, p \u2265 1. This defines the renormalized correlator:\n\u2206(0) \u2212 \u2206(w) = \u03c3w ,\n\n(208)\n\ni.e. it is exactly the bare disorder correlator. Note that although this result was derived from a conditional probability, it is independent of the choice of u1 and w1 provided all\npoints wi to which it applies are larger than w1 . Note also\nthat although the 2-point correlator is the bare one, the higher\ncumulants are different: they are non-trivial and can be easily\ncomputed from (206). Hence the system flows to a non-trivial\nfixed point. Remarkably, one can check that (208) is an exact fixed point of the 2-loop FRG equation for \u2206\u2032 (u), i.e. the\nderivative of (7) [95] using the value \u03b6 = \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d (here\n\u03b6 = 4 which is the correct value for the present model).\nWe can also check that (208) satisfies the general relation\n\u2212\n\n2\u2206\u2032 (0+ )\n\u03c3\nhs2 i\n= 2 4 = 2sm =\n.\n4\nm\nm\nhsi\n\n(209)\n\nIn fact, we can also check some of the general relations discussed in [62, 84] for the so-called higher Kolmogorov cumulants, defined there:\nG(\u03bb) := exp(\u03bb[u(w) \u2212 w \u2212 u(w\u2032 ) \u2212 w\u2032 )] \u2212 1\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 4\u03bbsm\n\u2032 1\u2212\n\u2212 \u03bb] \u2212 1\n= exp [w \u2212 w ][\n2sm\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 4\u03bbsm\n\u2212 \u03bb (w \u2212 w\u2032 ) + O((w \u2212 w\u2032 )2 )\n=\n2sm\n(210)\nfor w > w\u2032 \u2265 w1 , using formula (E6) for the Laplace transform of the first passage time probability with b = 1 and\n\n\f21\nD = sm . This is related to the fact that the full distribution\nof avalanche sizes at the tree level (i.e. in mean field) in the\nfield theory coincides with the distribution of return times of\nthe 1-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\nB.\n\nMotion at finite velocity v > 0\n\nLet us now consider the case w(t) = vt, i.e. a particle\npulled by a spring at constant velocity:\n\u2202t u(t) = F (u(t)) + m2 (vt \u2212 u(t)) .\n\n(211)\n\nFor simplicity, we set \u03b7 = 1(it can be restored by setting t \u2192\nt/\u03b7 and v \u2192 \u03b7v). For v > 0 and since it is an over-damped\nequation of motion (no overshoot), the instantaneous velocity\nvt := \u2202t u is positive (possibly after a short transient), hence\none can write vt = v(u(t)), which satisfies:\n\u2202t vt = F \u2032 (u(t))vt + m2 (v \u2212 vt )\n\u0015\n\u0014\nv\n\u2212 1 + F \u2032 (u)\n\u2202u v(u) = m2\nv(u)\n\n(212)\n(213)\n\nSince for the Brownian-force landscape F \u2032 (u) is a white\nnoise, the second equation is a standard Langevin equation,\nhence the probability to observe v at u, given that the velocity\nis v0 at u0 satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation:\n\u2202u P = \u2202v [\u03c3\u2202v P + (\u2202v E(v))P ]\nE(v) = \u2212m2 v ln v + m2 v\n\n(214)\n(215)\n\nwith delta function initial condition. For u \u2192 \u221e it converges\nto the equilibrium measure:\nPeq (v) = Z \u22121 e\u2212E(v)/\u03c3\n2\n\n=\n\nm2 v/\u03c3\n\n2\n2\n(m /\u03c3)\nvm v/\u03c3 e\u2212m v/\u03c3\nv\u0393(m2 v/\u03c3)\n\n(216)\n\nOne can also directly work with (212), rewriting it as a\nstochastic equation [77]:\ndvt = dF (t) + m2 (v \u2212 vt )dt .\n\n(217)\n\ndF (t)2 = 2\u03c3vt dt is a Brownian motion up to a time\nreparametrization, and the factor vt can be seen by writing\nR\nR\ndu( dFdu(u) )2 = dtvt\u22121 ( dFdt(t) )2 . In It\u00f4 prescription this\nyields the Fokker-Planck equation for the probability Q(vt =\nv, t|v0 , t0 ) of velocity v:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(218)\n\u2202t Q = \u2202v \u03c3\u2202v (vQ) + m2 (v \u2212 v)Q\n= \u2202v [\u03c3\u2202v (vQ) + v(\u2202v E(v))Q]\n(219)\nHence the steady-state solution for t \u2192 \u221e is Qeq \u223c v\u22121 Peq ,\nthe velocity factor originating from the change of variable\nfrom u to t. One has [77]:\n2\n\n(m2 /\u03c3)m v/\u03c3 \u22121+m2 v/\u03c3 \u2212m2 v/\u03c3\nv\ne\nQeq (v) =\n\u0393(m2 v/\u03c3)\n\n(220)\n\nwhich yields the average velocity vQ = v, as expected,\nand the connected expectation of the square of the velocity\nQ,c\nv2\n= v m\u03c32 . Note that the average velocity using P is\nP\nv = v + m\u03c32 , hence it does not even vanish as v \u2192 0+ :\nthis is because most (in fact, as m \u2192 0, all) of the u segments belong to avalanches, yielding a finite average velocity\nif weighted by du, but that the fraction of time spent on them\ngoes to zero, consistent with v \u2192 0+ .\nABBM also noted that the correlation function\nZ\nC(t\u2212t0 ) := dvt dv0 (vt \u2212v)(v0 \u2212v)Q(vt , t|v0 , t0 )Qeq (v0 )\n(221)\n\nsatisfies the very simple equation (see also [85]):\n\u2202t C = \u2212m2 C\n\n(222)\n\nobtained by multiplying (218) by (vt \u2212 v)(v0 \u2212 v)Qeq (v0 ),\nintegrating over vt = v and v0 and using the fact that the\ncurrent J = \u03c3\u2202v vQ + m2 (v \u2212 v)Q vanishes at v = 0 and\nv \u2192 \u221e. After integration by parts one obtains (222).\nFrom this we can now obtain the renormalized disorder \u2206\nat v > 0 and discuss the crossover. One first notes that from\nthe definition (5), inserting w = vt and w\u2032 = vt\u2032 and taking\ntwo derivatives, one has\nC(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = (vt \u2212 v)(vt\u2032 \u2212 v) = \u2212v 2 m\u22124 \u2206\u2032\u2032 (v(t \u2212 t\u2032 )) .\n(223)\nSince from (222) and above,\n2\n\nC(t) = v\u03c3m\u22122 e\u2212m t ,\n\n(224)\n\n2\n\u03c3\n\u2206\u2032\u2032 (w) = \u2212 m2 e\u2212m w/v .\nv\n\n(225)\n\nwe obtain\n\nIntegrating twice we finally get:\n\u2206(0) \u2212 \u2206(w) = \u03c3w \u2212\n\n2\n\u03c3v\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212m w/v ) ,\n2\nm\n\n(226)\n\na formula valid for any v > 0. The integration constant has\nbeen fixed by either of the two equivalent conditions: (i) no\ncusp at w = 0; (ii) the large-w behavior is the same as in\nthe bare model, and as in the statics, i.e. in the limit v \u2192 0,\ngiven by (208). A non-zero velocity v > 0 thus smoothens\nthe cusp in a boundary layer of size w \u223c v/m2 , but the function remains non-analytic: there is a subcusp, i.e. a non-zero\n\u2206\u2032\u2032\u2032 (0+ ); indeed one has at small w:\n\u2206(0) \u2212 \u2206(w) =\n\nm2 \u03c3 2 m4 \u03c3 3\nw + O(w4 )\nw \u2212\n2v\n6v 2\n\n(227)\n\nThis indicates continuity of u(w(t)) but jumps in its derivative, the velocity. It remains to be understood whether this\nfeature is more general or if it is tied to the long-range nature\nof the random force landscape.\nThe distribution of avalanches times (in t) and sizes (in u)\nat v > 0 can be extracted by studying the returns \"near\" the\n\n\f22\norigin of the process , i.e. the return to the origin inside the\npotential well E(v). This is given by (212) or equivalently by\n\u0011\n\u0010v\n\u221a\n\u2212 1 du + 2\u03c3 dB ,\ndv = m2\n(228)\nv\n\nwhere dB(u) is a standard unit Brownian motion. Near\nv = 0 we can first ignore the drift term \u2212m2 du. Define the\nchange of variables y = 2\u03c3u, then v(u) = r(y = 2\u03c3u) =\nq\nPd\u0303\n2\n \u0303\ni=1 xi (y) is the norm of a d-dimensional BM in the variable y [92], which satisfies:\nd \u0303 \u2212 1\ndy + dB(y)\n2r\nm2 v\n.\nd \u0303 = 1 +\n\u03c3\n\ndr =\n\n(229)\n(230)\n\n \u0303\nThis yields the avalanche-size exponent \u03c4 = 2 \u2212 d/2,\nfor\n \u0303\nd \u2264 2, from the power law decay of first return probabilites of\na Brownian near the origin, see appendix G\n\u03c4=\n\n3 m2 v\n\u2212\n2\n2\u03c3\n\n(231)\n\nbelow a critical velocity v \u2264 \u03c3/m2 . This result was anticipated in Ref. [90, 91]. Note that the definition of avalanches\nat v > 0 is not clear cut and requires a small velocity cutoff\nnoted v0 . In Appendix E 3 it is shown that:\n1 \u0010 s0 \u0011\u03c4 \u22121 \u2212s0 /s\n1\ne\n(232)\nP (s) =\n\u0393(\u03c4 \u2212 1) s s\ns0 = v02 /(4\u03c3)\n\nbunch of small avalanches of the first kind separated by one of\nthe second kind. Eventually at larger velocities returns to the\norigin v0 \u226a v become very rare events and there is no real\nsense in which one can talk about avalanches.\nVII.\n\nDEPINNING AND EXTREME STATISTICS OF\nRECORDS\n\nA. Model without a mass: records without drifts\n\nFor a particle pulled through a random-force landscape it is\nalso possible to consider the problem without a parabola. The\nproblem is easier to solve, but the correspondence with the\nFRG calculations is much less clear. Let us give here some\nelementary results.\nWe now have to solve for the smallest root u(f ) of\nf = \u2212F (u)\n\n(234)\n\nwhere f is the applied force. We study the case where the\nforce is continually increased. The process u(f ) then has\njumps from ui to ui+1 as the force crosses the values fi ,\nwhich form an increasing sequence. These values are called\nthe record values for the process F (u), and the ui the record\ntimes. Statistics of records thus naturally occurs in the physics\nof depinning. The problem is to find the running maximum\n(i.e. the record) of an unbiased process, while in the case of a\nmass it had a drift. In the absence of a drift the only scale in\nthe problem is the system size M .\n\n(233)\n\nfor v0 \u226a v. Since the drift is neglected (233) holds only for\ns \u226a sm = \u03c3/m4 the large scale cutoff. The drift provides a\nlarge velocity cutoff v> = \u03c3/m2 in (216), (220) and a large\nrelaxation time cutoff t> = m\u22122 , with sm = v> t> . For\nlarger velocity v > \u03c3/m2 the behavior changes qualitatively.\nIt corresponds to d \u0303 > 2, see appendix G, and the most probable velocity in Qeq (v) is no longer near v = 0.\nMore details and the solution including the drift term, are\ngiven in Appendix E 3 for the various regimes. In particular\nit is shown that one recovers the quasi-static size-distribution\nobtained above in the limit v = 0+ [96]. For v \u2264 \u03c3/m2\nthe random walk v(u), in the continuum limit, comes back infinitely often near the origin (i.e. near v0 ), hence the role of the\ndrift term is mainly to cut off the rare large avalanches, very\nmuch like in the statics (see e.g. the discussion in [62, 84]).\nFor v > \u03c3/m2 the random walk in velocity space is still\ncertain to come back near the origin but only because of the\ndrift. There are then two types of avalanches. In a fraction\nof them (computed in Appendix E 3) the instantaneous velocity v does not reach v: these avalanches are still described by\nthe model without the drift (first-return \"time\", conditioned to\nreturn) and lead to power law distributions. In the rest, the velocity reaches v and equilibrates in the well E(v); the \"time\"\nbetween two\nreturns at small v0 \u226a v can then be estimated as\n2\n\u223c (v0 )\u2212m v/\u03c3 proportional to the inverse equilibrium probability (either Peq or Qeq depending on whether one is interested in avalanche size or duration). Typically there will be a\n\n1.\n\nUncorrelated forces\n\nLet us start with the discrete model of uncorrelated forces\nstudied in Section III A, characterized by a force distribution\nPf (F ) for each site. A similar problem was studied in [72]\n(section IV-B). There the probability distribution of the full\nrecord value sequence (f1 < f2 , . . . < fn , . . .) was obtained\nfor a semi-infinite line. It can be mapped onto a sum of independent variables as follows: The sequence distribution can\nbe obtained from\n\u03a6(fn ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nai\n\n(235)\n\ni=0\n\nfor any n > 1, where the ai are independent positive random\nvariables, each with an exponential distribution P (a)da =\ne\u2212a da. The function:\nZ f\n\u03a6(f ) = \u2212 ln\ndF Pf (F )\n(236)\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndescribes the tail of the distribution, here the smallest f . For\nstretched exponential tails, as in class I, the growth is fn \u223c\nn1/\u03b3 , while for power law tails, as in class II, the growth is\nexponential in n.\nAnother set of results, remarkably universal, is known\n[73, 74] for the probability P (N |M ) of the number of records\n\n\f23\nN , here equal to the number of jumps, for a system of size M\n(notations are inverted as compared to [73]). Then for an uncorrelated sequence of Fi it was shown [86] that at large M\n\u221a\nN = ln M + \u03be ln M ,\n(237)\n\nHence for large sizes M , the average number of jumps behaves as [73]:\n\nwhere \u03be is a univariate gaussian random variable [75, 76].\nHence the translationally-averaged avalanche size in absence\nof a mass should be\n\nThere are also results for the jump sizes si , named record\nages li in\u221aRef. [73]. The typical jump size is styp =\nM/N = \u03c0M /2 while the average maximal jump size is\nsmax =p0.626508M and the average minimal jump size is\nsmin = M/\u03c0 [73].\n\nN\nM\nM\n1 X\nsi =\n\u2192\n,\nN i=1\nN\nln M\n\n(238)\n\n. In the language of\ni.e. it is the typical avalanche size M\nN\nrecords the avalanche sizes si = ui+1 \u2212 ui are the time intervals between successive records, also called record ages. The\ntranslational average grows unboundedly with system size.\nHence there are very few avalanches and they are almost as\nlarge as the system. Note that, at variance with the results on\nthe sequence fi , this result is independent of the distribution\nPf (F ) for continuous distributions.\n2.\n\nIn the case of a landscape obtained as a discrete-time random walk, Fi = Fi\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7i where \u03b7i are uncorrelated random\nvariables drawn from the same symmetric continuous distribution P (\u2212\u03b7) = P (\u03b7), it was recently obtained in Ref.

Model with a mass: records with a drift\n\nThe usual problem of records with drifts [74] consists in\nstudying the sequence:\nYi = Xi + ci\n\n(241)\n\nwith c > 0 where the Xi are symmetric random variables.\nOne way to present the correspondence to the depinning\nmodel with a mass [97] is that\n\nForces correlated as a random walk\n\n2000\n\n2 \u221a\nN\u2248\u221a\nM\n\u03c0\n\n10 000\n\nXi = \u2212Fi ,\n\nc = m2 .\n\n(242)\n\nThe set of (upper) records Yip , p = 1, . . . , N , i = 1, . . . , M ,\ni.e. successive highest values, are the values m2 wp at which\na jump from up = ip to up+1 = ip+1 occurs in the process\nu(w).\n\n1.\n\nShort-range correlations\n\nIn the case of i.i.d. random variables with a drift it was\nshown that the total number of records N up to time M grows\nlinearly as N \u223c r(c)M with (normal) fluctuations which were\ncharacterized [74, 76]. However obtaining analytic results,\neven for r(c), for a general distribution was found difficult\nand some results were obtained only for special distributions\nP (F ) [74, 76]. The function r(c) is related to the avalanche\ndensity 1/ hsi = r(c), which is finite in presence of a mass,\nand is computed here for small m2 = c. We solved the problem for arbitrary distributions P (F ) and found universality in\nthe small c-limit, with three classes. In addition we obtained\nthe joint distribution P (w, s) of (i) the time s between one\nrecord and the next; (ii) the difference in value w with the\nprevious record [98]. These results were given in in Section\nIV.\n\n-2000\n\n2.\nFIG. 18: \u03c6(u) defined in (201) for f a random walk with D = 1.67\u00d7\n103 (blue). The dashed (red) line denotes \u03c6(u) = 0 (walk with no\ndrift). We show explicitly the graphical construction of u(w) for\nw = 3400, as well as a larger avalanche of size S = 4401. The\nsystem is discretized with stepsize 1 in u direction.\n\nLong-range correlations\n\nLet us now extend the discussion of Ref. [73] to records\nwith drift, i.e. depinning with a mass. Again we consider the\nrandom walk Xi = Xi\u22121 + \u03b7i with i.i.d. random variables\n\u03b7 = \u2212F of distribution Pf (\u03b7). The alert reader will note that\n\n\f24\nPf (\u03b7), Pava (s) and P (s) below denote three different probabilities and functions.\nPf (\u03b7) produces a correlated sequence\nPn\nXn \u2212 X0 = i=1 \u03b7i . For n \u2265 1 we set:\nP (n) = Prob(Xn < X0 \u2212 cn) = Prob(Yn < Y0 )\nQ(n) = Prob(Xi < X0 \u2212 ci, i = 1, . . . , n)\n(243)\n= Prob(Yi < Y0 , i = 1, . . . , n)\n(244)\n\nThe Sparre-Andersen theorem [87\u201389] states that\nQ(z) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nQ(n)z n = exp\n\nn=0\n\n\u221e\n\u0010X\nP (n) n \u0011\nz ,\nn\nn=1\n\n(245)\n\nsetting Q(0) = 1 by convention.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT AN\nN -COMPONENT DISPLACEMENT FIELD\n\nUp to now, we have considered particles, and more generally elastic objects and manifolds, whose position is a 1component function. We now consider particles or elastic objects embedded in higher dimensions N > 1. For simplicity,\nwe focus on a particle, but the considerations in this short section can be extended to d-dimensional elastic manifolds. In\nthe next section we consider an application to a particle driven\nin a 2-dimensional random energy landscape.\nConsider two particles, which see the same random energy\nlandscape, but which sit in different parabolas, labeled 1 and\n2. These parabola are chosen with the same curvature m2\nbut their centers differ, and can have very different trajectories, which we call {w1 (t)} and {w2 (t)}. An interesting\ncase is when the trajectories differ but the endpoints coincide\nw1 (ti,f ) = w2 (ti,f ) as in the example of figure 19. In that\nexample it is clear that\n|uw1 (tf ) \u2212 uw2 (tf )| \u2248\n\n\u221a fc\n2 2 .\nm\n\n(258)\n\ny\n\n2\n\nw2( t )\n\nw( tf )\n1\n\nw1( t )\nx\nFIG. 19: 2 particles dragged through a random energy landscape by\nparabolic potentials (springs) whose centers have identical starting\nand final positions but follow different paths {w1 (t)} and {w2 (t)}.\n\nThis is because there should be a non-zero critical force, fc ,\nand that each particle lags behind each parabola center wi (t),\nup to fluctuations, roughly in minus the direction of drift.\nThus the process uw depends on the trajectory w(t), and to define a single valued function uw , we have to restrict to a single\nwell-defined trajectory w(t) in a quasi-static limit. Consider\nnow figure 20. Both parabolas move with the same velocity\nv in x-direction. They are completely characterized by their\nposition w\n~ = {x = x0 + vt, ~y }, with w\n~ \u2208 RN , ~y \u2208 RN \u22121 .\nEspecially note that without loss of generality, x0 can be put\nto 0. Again we integrate the Langevin-equation (1), to define\n~u(w).\n~\nA more difficult question is whether ~u(w)\n~ depends on the\ninitial condition ~u(t0 ), and since we have set x0 to 0, implicitly on the starting time t0 . One expects (see next Section how\nit occurs) that the dependence of ~u(w)\n~ on t0 disappears in the\nlimit of t0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, and this is the limit we are interested in.\nThis could be checked, similar to the exact sampling method,\nsee e.g. [65], by starting at time t0 , and checking that at the\ntime of interest t, all trajectories from all possible initial conditions have converged towards a single one. If not, one starts\nat an earlier time t\u22121 , and checks again, repeating this procedure until all trajectories have converged. This defines a function ~u(w),\n~ which is now independent of the initial time and\nconditions. In the next section it will be checked numerically\nthat for a particle driven through a two dimensional bounded\nrandom energy landscape, all trajectories indeed converge, see\nfigure 21. It is also found there that the so-called no crossing\nproperty (Middleton theorem [58]) does not hold for N = 2:\nalthough violations appear to be rare there are some instances\nof two trajectories splitting up. This results from a second particle (more properly, a second trajectory of the same particle\nwith a different initial condition) arriving at a later time on the\nsame site: it then feels a stronger drive from the parabola and\nmay jump forward and pass the first particle. An example is\nshown in figure 21.\nHaving given an unambiguous definition of ~u(w),\n~ we can\ncalculate connected correlation functions of its moments,\n\n\f26\ny\n\n\u272f\n\u271f\n\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\n\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\n\n1\n\n0\nx\n\nFIG. 21: Trajectories of particles dragged from left to right by a parabolic well. Trajectories starting at different random initial positions all\nconverge towards the same trajectory, with the same position at a given time (which is not visible on the plot). The minimum position of the\nparabola in y-direction is indicated by a straight (orange/grey) line. At the right, we show our coordinate system. The inset at the top is a\nblowup of part of the curve. It shows a deviation from the no crossing property which holds for N = 1 (Middleton theorem [58]): Trajectories\nwhich are together can split up, even if later on they join again (see text).\n\nFIG. 22: Trajectories of 200 particles dragged from left to right. All particles start at (0,0). However, they sit in different potential wells (as\ndescribed in the main text). As can be seen, they mostly move together on preferred trajectories, before separating again. The endpoints are\njoined by yellow lines. m2 = 0.003. The particles in the two outer wells, as the center one, are marked in colors (red/blue, green). The well\nwas moved for a total of 1000 steps.\n\nwhich again define \u2206, (now a tensor), and higher cumulants.\nFor this tensor the driving direction x will play a special role\n(for N > 2 we expect isotropy in the other N \u2212 1 directions.\nThe calculation is done for a particle in the next section. Other\ndefinitions of ~u(w)\n~ could of course be given. The simplest one\nis to pick a fixed but different driving direction. From statistical isotropy of the disorder the results should be the same\nup to the rotation. We defer the study of more complicated\ndriving processes to future work.\n\nthe lowest final energy. We allow moves to the eight nearest\nneighbors numbered from 1 to 8 (starting at the center 0):\n\nIX. A PARTICLE DRAGGED IN TWO DIMENSIONS:\nd = 0, N = 2\n\nIf a move is possible, we perform it and then try other moves\nagain, until the particle finally gets stuck. If several moves are\npossible, we take the one which results in the largest descent\nin energy, i.e. we go into the direction of the maximum force.\nOnly then, we update the position of the parabola, by moving\nit from w to w + dw = w + vdt. We record the particle\nposition as a function of time t.\nWe first show numerically that there is a unique attractor\ntrajectory (see figure 21). Start particles at random positions,\nbut in the same parabolic well. Then move the parabola in\na given direction (here always to the right, also denoted the\nx-direction). One sees that trajectories converge, and particles will have the same position at a given time (not visible\n\nWe now study particles dragged through a 2-dimensional\nrandom-energy landscape.\nThe algorithm works as follows: We generate a randomenergy landscape on a square lattice. A particle in addition\nsees a parabolic well. The total energy is the sum of both.\nWe will mostly use a box distribution for the energy of a site,\nuniform in [0, 1]. Energies on different sites are uncorrelated.\nWe then update all particle positions: If a particle can move in\na direction s.t. it will lower its potential energy, it will do so.\nIf there are several such directions, it will choose the one with\n\n8\n\n1\n\n2\n\n7\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\f27\non figure 21, which only shows the world-lines.) This convergence can be understood from the fact that if two \"particles\"\n(in fact these are the same particle but with different initial\nconditions) meet at a site at the same time, their future evolution is identical. Hence the deep sites with low energies where\nthe particle gets temporarily stuck act as sinks where the trajectories merge. Clearly, the particle needs to be trapped long\nenough for the process to be efficient.\nOur proper simulation is done with many particles (here\n200), each sitting in a parabola which are displaced by one\nunit (or in general by dy) to the top. This gives us data-points\nin the y-direction. In the x-direction (in which we move the\nparabolas), we use that after some time t the parabola has been\ndisplaced by a distance vt. We denote the minimum of the\ni\nparabola wt,y and its ith component wt,y\nas\nwt,y := (vt, y) ,\n\n0\nwt,y\n:= vt ,\n\n1\nwt,y\n:= y\n\nm2\n0.00001\n0.00003\n0.0001\n0.0003\n0.001\n0.003\n0.01\n0.03\n0.1\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n\ncolor\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n0.02\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nx\n\n(259)\n\nThe particle sitting in this parabola will have position uwt,y ,\nwith components uiwt,y .

For smaller and smaller\nmasses, there will be more and more data-points. Steps in\nthe x-direction are necessarily discretized, of size dw = vdt.\nThis poses an additional problem not present for N = 1:\nthere choosing a dw too large results in a loss in precision\n(since some smaller jumps may be overrun) but does not have\ndramatic consequences for large jumps, especially does not\nchange the endpoint u(w), due to Middleton's theorem [58].\nIn contrast, for N = 2, if the parabola is not moved adiabatically , the particles will see a strong force forward, and\ntherefore be more likely to move forward, instead of sideward,\nthus embarking on a different trajectory. This may alter the\nwhole trajectory over a much larger region. In practice, we\ndecided to never move the parabola by more than one unit,\nbefore checking whether a move could be made. It may be a\npossible source for finite-size corrections. These will disappear if, and only if the critical force scales to zero for m \u2192 0,\nsince the energy gain for an elementary move is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0003\n1\nm2 \u0002\n2\n2\n2\n\u2248 fc\n(u + 1 \u2212 w) \u2212 (u \u2212 w) = m u \u2212 w +\n2\n2\n(264)\nHowever, fc goes slowly towards 1, by which it is bounded.\nUnfortunately we find e.g. fc (m2 = 0.01) = 0.464602,\nfc (m2 = 0.0001) = 0.785073.

The scaling collapse is perfect except for the two largest masses.\n\nthe step-size we have used is still too large. We have not attempted to use a smaller step-size due to the enormous computing powers needed. We nevertheless believe that the results\nare valid for the following reason: fc measures the time average of uw \u2212 w, but we have to know the forward force exerted\nby the spring, when the particle arrives at the trap, Clearly,\nthis must be much smaller, otherwise in a few steps the force\nwould have increased by 1, which is sufficient to overcome\nany barrier for the box-distributed random energies, and the\nparticle would not remain pinned for a long time. However\nwe see diverging trapping times in the simulations, thus the\nargument using eq. (264) is not valid.\nWe now present data for the force-force correlators in figures 23 to 27, for masses ranging from m2 = 0.1 to m2 =\n10\u22125 , descending in half-decades. A first and important qualitative conclusion to be drawn is that all correlators not only\ndepend on x, but also on y. This is in contradiction to the\nfixed-point structure used by Erta\u015f and Kardar [63], whose\n\u2206ij depends only on x but not on y.\nOur aim is to determine the scaling exponents \u03b6x and \u03b6y\nfrom the finite-mass scaling-ansatz, suggested by the FRG\nequations for this problem [66]:\n \u0303 ij (x, y) := m\u22124+\u03b6i +\u03b6j \u2206ij (xm\u2212\u03b6x , ym\u2212\u03b6y ) ,\n\u2206\nm\n\n(265)\n\n \u0303m \u2192 \u2206\n \u0303 for m \u2192 0.

CONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude we have shown how the renormalized disorder correlator \u2206(w), central to the Functional RG theory of\ndepinning, can be measured for a manifold of internal dimension d driven by a spring in a N = 1 random landscape. This\ncorrelator contains information about the stick slip motion of\nthe interface.\nWe have solved analytically the case d = 0 of a particle in a\nshort-range correlated pinning-force landscape, finding three\n\n\f29\nuniversality classes. In each case we have obtained the universal fixed-point forms for \u2206(w) for quasi-static driving, i.e. the\ndepinning fixed point. In all cases it exhibits the famous cusp\nat w = 0+ . We have also obtained the distribution of critical forces, avalanche sizes and waiting times, and checked\nthe general relations conjectured to hold between their moments and the cusp \u2206\u2032 (0+ ). While the exponent \u03b6 can take\nvarious values depending on the class, the avalanche-size exponent was found to be \u03c4 = 0 in all cases, which invalidates,\nat least at a naive level, the conjecture \u03c4 = 2 \u2212 2/(d + \u03b6). We\nalso found that the distribution of avalanche sizes and waiting\ntimes are identical in the scaling limit.\nWe have extended our results to a particle driven in a force\nlandscapes with the correlations of a random walk. In the\nBrownian case, known as the ABBM model for interface motion and Barkhausen noise, it is possible to solve for any driving velocity and check the quasi-static limit. Remarkably this\nmodel has much in common with the mean field theory of\navalanches and recent FRG results for avalanche distributions\nin d = 4. Since \u03b6 = 4, the avalanche exponent for v = 0+\nobeys, in that case, the conjecture \u03c4 = 2 \u2212 2/(d + \u03b6).\nIn each case we have emphasized the connections between\nthe depinning problem for a particle and the extremal statistics\nof records, with and without drifts.\nThese exact results in d = 0 provide interesting checks and\ninterpretations of the Functional RG theory, and help us understand what we should expect for manifolds.\nFinally, we started addressing the problem of depinning for\nN > 1, mostly numerically; even for a particle it is quite nontrivial. We have checked numerically the consistency of the\nmethod, based on the ergodicity in presence of driving via a\nquadratic well. Numerous open problems remain.\n\ndemonstrated, as e.g. extensions to N > 1 components is less\nstraightforward than in the statics [56, 57]. At a formal level\nhowever the arguments are rather similar.\nWe use notations of the text and consider the equation of\nmotion:\n\u03b7\u2202t u(x, t) = Fx [u(t); w(t)] + \u03be(x, t)\n(A1)\nFx [u; w] = m2 (w(x) \u2212 u(x)) + \u22072x u(x) + F (x, u(x))\nwhere w(t) is given, and \u03be(x, t) the thermal noise. We denote\nin general implicitly usxt = u(x, t; u0 (x, t0 ), F, \u03be) the solution\nfor given initial condition, disorder and thermal noise.\n\n1. Definition of functionals\n\nLet us first recall the definition of the useful functional of\nthe dynamical field theory. We write the dynamical (MSR)\naction S in compact notation as:\n1\nS[u, \u00fb] = \u00fb * g \u22121 * u + \u00fb * A(0) [u] \u2212 \u00fb * B (0) [u] * \u00fb .\n2\n+O(\u00fb3 )\n(A2)\nR\nFor any \"vectors\" u, v we denote u * v := xt uxt vxt (and\nadditional index contraction for N > 1), A and B are respectively vector and matrix functionals. gxy can be an arbitrary\n(time independent) symmetric matrix but the usual choice is\n(in Fourier) gq\u22121 = q 2 + m2 . The functionals defining the bare\naction are\nA(0) [u]xt = \u03b7\u2202t uxt\nB\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank Michel Bauer, Jean Philippe\nBouchaud, Andrei Fedorenko, Satya Majumdar and Alberto\nRosso for stimulating discussions, some in the context of the\nBeg-Rohu school \"Manifolds in random media, random matrices and extreme value statistics\", organized by Gulio Biroli\nand Claude Godreche, whom we gladly acknowledge.\nThis work was supported by ANR under program 05BLAN-0099-01, and in part through NSF under grant number\nPHY05-51164 during the program SLE06 at KITP.\n\nAPPENDIX A: DYNAMICAL ACTION AND OBSERVABLES\n\nIn this Section we establish the relation between the effective action and observables; this is an extension to the dynamics of the proof given in [56, 57] for the statics. It. This relation allows to measure the correlator of the dynamical FRG as\nexplained in the text. Since the dynamical field theory is significantly more complicated than the static replica field theory, the arguments presented here may be slightly less general\nand rely on further assumptions about the nature of the quasistatic limit and its ergodic properties, some remaining to be\n\n(0)\n\n[u]xt,x\u2032 t\u2032 = 2\u03b7T \u03b4xx\u2032 \u03b4tt\u2032 + \u22060 (uxt \u2212 ux\u2032 t\u2032 )\u03b4xx\u2032\n\n(A3)\n(A4)\n\nwhich is the standard MSR action averaged over disorder. The\nstatistical tilt symmetry (STS) of the bare action states that\nA(0) [u] and B (0) [u] are invariant under the change uxt \u2192\nuxt + \u03c6x . It implies the same symmetry for A[u] and B[u].\nThe generating function of connected correlations is\nZ\nh\nexp(W [w, \u0175]) := D[u] D[\u00fb] exp \u2212 S[u, \u00fb]\ni\n+ \u00fb * g \u22121 * w + \u0175 * g \u22121 * u , (A5)\n\nwhere the sources have been redefined, following [56, 57], in a\nconvenient way for the following. It also admits an expansion\nsimilar to the action:\n1\nW [w, \u0175] = \u0175 * g \u22121 * w \u2212 \u0175 * \u00c2[w] + \u0175 * B\u0302[w] * \u0175\n2\n+O(\u01753 )\n(A6)\n\nwhere the STS implies that \u00c2[w] and B\u0302[w] are invariant under\nthe change wxt \u2192 wxt + \u03c6x . Finally the effective action\nfunctional \u0393 is defined as usual as the Legendre transform of\nW:\nW [w, \u0175] + \u0393[u, \u00fb] = \u00fb * g \u22121 * w + \u0175 * g \u22121 * u .\n\n(A7)\n\n\f30\nIt admits the expansion:\n1\n\u0393[u, \u00fb] = \u00fb * g \u22121 * u + \u00fb * A[u] \u2212 \u00fb * B[u] * \u00fb\n2\n+O(\u00fb3 ) .\n(A8)\nSTS implies the same symmetry for A[u] and B[u] as for\nA(0) [u] and B (0) [u].\n\nMore relations can be derived e.g. by considering the formal\nexpansion (symbolically):\nW [w + \u03b4w, \u0175]\nX\nc\n1\n=\nh\u00fb..\u00fbu..uiw (g \u22121 \u03b4w)n1 (g \u22121 \u0175)n2\nn\n!n\n!\n1\n2\nn n\n1\n\n2\n\nHence one has:\n\u22121\nh\u00fbx\u2032 t\u2032 uxt iw = gxx\n\u2032 \u03b4tt\u2032 \u2212 (\u2207w \u00c2[w])x\u2032 t\u2032 ,xt\n\n2. Relations to observables\n\nThe functional W is directly related to observables, i.e. correlation functions, in the following way: Consider the average\nover solutions of the equation of motion,\nZ\nR\n\u22121\n\u22121\ns\nhe xt \u0175*g *u i\u03be,u0 = D[u]D[\u00fb] e\u2212Sw [u,\u00fb]+\u0175*g *uxt\nZ\n\u22121\n\u22121\n= D[u]D[\u00fb] ue\u2212S[u,\u00fb]+\u00fb*g *w+\u0175*g *u = eW [w,\u0175] (A9)\n\nHere Sw is the MSR action in presence of w, while S \u2261 Sw=0\nis the action defined above, in the absence of w. As usual, to\ntake into account the initial conditions (if necessary) all time\nintegrals start at t0 and an additional integral D[u0 ] P [u0 ] fixes\nits probability at t = t0 . Expanding the above average, one\nfinds:\n\nhuxt iw = wxt \u2212 gxy \u00c2yt [w]\n\n(A11)\n\nhuxt ux\u2032 t\u2032 iw \u2212 huxt iw hux\u2032 t\u2032 iw = gxy gx\u2032 y\u2032 B\u0302yt,y\u2032 t\u2032 [w] ,(A12)\nwhere summation (integration) over repeated indices is implicit. Until now wxt is arbitrary. For a uniform driving wt\none has:\nZ\n1\nh(wt \u2212 \u016bt )i = m\u22122 d\n\u00c2yt [w]\n(A13)\nL y\nh(wt \u2212 \u016bt )(wt\u2032 \u2212 \u016bt\u2032 )i \u2212 h(wt \u2212 \u016bt )i h(wt\u2032 \u2212 \u016bt\u2032 )i\nZ\n1\n= m\u22124 2d\n(A14)\nB\u0302yt,y\u2032 t\u2032 [w]\nL\nyy \u2032\nThese are the (spatially) local parts of the \u00c2 and B\u0302 functionals, and we expect:\nZ\n1\nlim\nlim\nlim d\n\u00c2yt [w] = fc\n(A15)\nL\u2192\u221e \u2202t w(t)\u21920+ T \u21920 L\ny\nZ\n1\nB\u0302yt,y\u2032 t\u2032 [w]\nlim\nlim\nlim 2d\nL\u2192\u221e \u2202t w(t)\u21920+ T \u21920 L\nyy \u2032\n\u02c6 t \u2212 wt\u2032 )\n(A16)\n= L\u2212d \u2206(w\n\n(A18)\n\nLet us also recall that the quadratic parts of W and \u0393 are (always):\nWquad [w, \u0175] = \u0175 * g \u22121 * R * g \u22121 * w\n1\n+ \u0175 * g \u22121 * C * g \u22121 * \u0175\n(A19)\n2\n1\n\u0393quad [u, \u00fb] = \u00fb * R\u22121 * u \u2212 \u00fb * D * \u00fb ,\n(A20)\n2\nwhere R and C are the exact response and correlation functions (in the absence of w) and C = Rt DR.\nFinally it is useful to mention the terms without disorder:\nA[u] = a * u\n\u2207u A[u] = at\ng \u22121 + a = R\u22121\n\u00c2[w] = \u00e2 * w\n\nW [w, \u0175] = \u0175 * g \u22121 * huiw\n1\n+ \u0175 * g \u22121 * (huuiw \u2212 huiw huiw ) * g \u22121 * \u0175\n2\n+O(\u01753 )\n(A10)\nNote that the (matrix) average huui \u2212 hui hui is not the\nconnected thermal average but the connected double (disorder+thermal) average. Note the index w which indicates that\nthe above averages, e.g. huxt iw , are averages w.r.t. Sw , i.e. in\npresence of the (given) driving wxt .

Legendre transform\n\nOur aim is to relate the functionals \u00c2 and B\u0302, which are\nobservables as established above, to the functionals A and B\nassociated to the effective action.\nLet us thus perform the Legendre transform. In this transformation one defines the functionals w[u, \u00fb] and \u0175[u, \u00fb]\nwhich allow to compute \u0393 from W using (A7). One has\n\u03b4\u0393\n= u + g * A[u] \u2212 g * B[u] * \u00fb + O(\u00fb2 ) (A29)\n\u03b4\u00fb\n\u03b4\u0393\n(A30)\n\u0175 = g *\n\u03b4u\n1\n= \u00fb + g * \u2207u A[u] * \u00fb \u2212 g * \u2207u \u00fb * B[u] * \u00fb + O(\u00fb3 )\n2\nThe inverse relations are useful as well:\nw=g*\n\n\u03b4W\n= w \u2212 g * \u00c2[w] + g * B\u0302[w] * \u0175 + O(\u01752 ) (A31)\n\u03b4 \u0175\n\u03b4W\n(A32)\n\u00fb = g *\n\u03b4w\n1\n= \u0175 \u2212 g * \u2207w \u00c2[w] * \u0175 + g * \u2207w \u0175 * B\u0302[w] * \u0175 + O(\u01753 )\n2\n\nu=g*\n\n\f31\nFrom (A29) and (A31) one deduces that\n\n4.\n\nw \u2212 u = g * A[u] + O(\u00fb) = g * \u00c2[w] + O(\u0175) .\n\n(A33)\n\nThis implies that\nA[u] = \u00c2[w] \u00fb=0 = \u00c2[u + g * A[u]] .\n\n(A34)\n\nwhich allows in principle to compute one functional from the\nother. One has the equivalent relation:\n\u00c2[w] = A[w \u2212 g * \u00c2[w]] .\n\n(A35)\n\nB[u] = \u2212g \u22121 * dw/d\u00fb ,\n\n(A36)\n\nMoreover\n\nwhere \u00fb should be set to zero at the end. We have used a\nnotation which makes the position of the indices clear. From\n(A30):\nd\u0175/d\u00fb = 1 + g * \u2207u A[u] \u2212 g * \u2207u \u00fb * B[u] + O(\u00fb2 ) (A37)\nNote the subtle difference with\n\u2190\n\n\u2190\n\ndw/du = 1 + g * A[u] \u2207u \u2212g * B[u] * \u00fb \u2207u +O(\u00fb2 ) . (A38)\nThis means that (at least at order O(\u00fb) = O(\u0175), but eventually even exact)\n\u0002\n\u0003t\n(A39)\ng \u22121 * dw/du = g \u22121 * d\u0175/d\u00fb\n\nEvaluation of the functionals\n\nLet us now evaluate the functionals \u00c2xt [{wyt }] and\nB\u0302xt,x\u2032 t\u2032 [{wyt }] in various situations.\nLet us consider first T > 0 equilibrium dynamics, i.e. a\ndriving function wyt which evolves infinitely slowly between\nwyt1 = w1 (y) and wyt2 = w2 (y) such that the system always\nremains in equilibrium (i.e. we consider the limit t2 \u2212t1 \u2192 \u221e\nat fixed w1 \u2212 w2 ). From (A11) and STS it is clear that\n\u00c2[w] = \u00c2[0] = 0 in that limit. This implies u = w in\n(A45) and also A[u] = 0. It then implies that B\u0302[w] = B[w]\nand one recovers the results of Ref. [56, 57] for the statics\nusing replicas. More precisely one expects in that limit that\nB\u0302yt,y\u2032 t\u2032 [w] = Byt,y\u2032 t\u2032 [w] = \u2202w1 (y) \u2202w2 (y\u2032 ) R[w1 , w2 ] where\nR\u0302 = R is the two-replica functional of the statics. Hence it\nis a statement only about the infinitely separated time part of\nthe B[w] functional and not about the smaller time separation\npart (which contains the renormalization of \u03b7 and highly complicated activated dynamics as described in [32]).\nConsider now T = 0 and wyt = w(t) = vt. From\ntranslational invariance \u00c2xt [w] (see e.g. (A11)) can only be\na time and space independent v dependent constant (assuming boundary conditions do not break translational invariance)\nwhich we choose to call f (m, v). Because of (A45) one must\nhave the equality\n\nFrom (A31) follows\n\nB[u] = \u2212g \u22121 * dw/d\u00fb\n\u0010\n\u0011.\n= \u2212g \u22121 d u + g * \u00c2[w] \u2212 g * B\u0302[w] * \u0175 + O(\u01752 )\nd\u00fb\n\u0010\n\u0011.\n= d \u2212\u00c2[w] + B\u0302[w] * \u0175 + O(\u01752 )\nd\u00fb\n\u2190\n\n= \u00c2[w] \u2207w *g * B[u] + B\u0302[w] * d\u0175/d\u00fb ,\n\n(A40)\n\nwhere it is implicit that \u00fb is set to zero at the end. It implies\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1 \u2212 [\u2207w \u00c2[w]]t * g *B[u] = B\u0302[w] (1 + g * \u2207u A[u])+O(\u00fb) .\n(A41)\nThis can also be written as:\n(d\u00fb/d\u0175)t * B[u] = B\u0302[w] * d\u0175/d\u00fb\n\n(A42)\n\nEquivalently:\nt\n\nB[u] = (d\u0175/d\u00fb) * B\u0302[w] * d\u0175/d\u00fb\n\n(A43)\n\nFinally, the relation between the B\u0302 and B functionals can be\nwritten as:\nt\n\nB[u] = (1 + g * \u2207u A[u]) * B\u0302[w]*(1 + g * \u2207u A[u]) , (A44)\nwhere in this relation u and w are related via:\nw \u2212 u = g * A[u] = g * \u00c2[w]\n\n(A45)\n\nIt can also be written equivalently as\n\u0011t\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nB\u0302[w] = 1 \u2212 g * \u2207w \u00c2[w] * B[u] * 1 \u2212 g * \u2207u \u00c2[w] .\n(A46)\n\n\u00c2xt [w] = Axt [u] = f (m, v)\n\n(A47)\n\nand u = w \u2212 m\u22122 f (m, v) = vt \u2212 m\u22122 f (m, v) in (A45). The\ndifference with the equilibrium statics is that this constant is\nnon-zero. This is allowed despite the STS symmetry because\nwe are considering the T = 0 limit first and the fact that w(t)\ndepends on t cannot be ignored even for v = 0+ . In that limit\none has fc (m, v = 0+ ) = fc\u2191 = \u2212fc (m, v = 0\u2212 ). Of course\nthe fact that the constant depends uniquely on v assumes some\nergodicity property, similarly if w(t) is a more complicated\nadiabatic function there could be in general some history dependence. These issues have been discussed in Section VIII.\nFor N = 1 we will rely on Middleton's theorem [58] which\nproves unicity of the solution. Note that at T > 0 (A47) remains true with a f (m, v, T ) such that f (m, 0, T ) = 0 in\nagreement with the discussion of the previous paragraph.\nSince the derivative of a constant is zero, using (A47) and\n(A44) we find that at T = 0 with the choice w = vt one has:\nByt,y\u2032 t\u2032 [u = u(t) = vt \u2212 m\u22122 f (m, v)]\n\u02c6\n= B\u0302yt,yt\u2032 [w] = \u2206(v(t\n\u2212 t\u2032 )) .\n\n(A48)\n\nDenoting Byt,yt\u2032 [u] = \u2206(u(t) \u2212 u(t\u2032 )) gives\n\u02c6\n\u2206(w) = \u2206(w)\n,\n\n(A49)\n\na result on which is based our measurement of \u2206(w) here and\nin [61].\n\n\f32\nAPPENDIX B: CALCULATION OF SOME INTEGRALS\n\nHere we compute the integrals in Eq.

This method does not seem very practical (see however\n[76]) and in the text we obtain the result by another method.\n\nDistribution of local area a = ws\n\ndy f \u2032\u2032 (y)e\u2212f (y+W )\u2212f (y+S)+f (y)\nZ \u221e\n.\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212f (y)\ndy f (y)e\n0\n\n(D3)\nwhere the denominator is such that the distribution is properly normalized. Also note that for some choice of variables,\none has to be careful with the bounds of integration, see the\nFr\u00e9chet classe, eq.

A of \u2212A P (w > W, s > S)\u03b4(A \u2212 W S),\nthe explicit derivative of A cancels the first term.\nInserting the integral representation (D3) for P (w >\nW, s > S) yields\nP (a > A) =\nZ\u221e\nZ\u221e\nA\u2202 dW\n\u2212\ndy f \u2032\u2032 (y) e\u2212f (y+W )\u2212f (y+A/W )+f (y)\n\u2202A\nW\n0\n0\nZ \u221e\ndy f \u2032\u2032 (y)e\u2212f (y)\n0\n\n(D5)\n\nNote that boundary terms from the partial integration in (D4)\nvanish except for w = 0 or s = 0, in which case A = 0. Thus\nwe could possibly have a term \u223c \u03b4(A). However we know\nthat for w = 0 we do not have a diverging probability for an\navalanche, and vice versa for w and s exchanged. The above\nresult can also be written as\nP (a > A) =\nZ\u221e Z\u221e\nw\n\u2212w\nA\u2202\ndw dy f \u2032\u2032 (y) e\u2212f (y+e )\u2212f (y+Ae )+f (y)\n\u2212\n\u2202A\n0\n0\nZ \u221e\ndy f \u2032\u2032 (y)e\u2212f (y)\n0\n\n(D6)\n\ny\n\nFor the Gumbel class, f (y) = e , and this yields the formula\ngiven in the text.\nAPPENDIX E: FIRST-PASSAGE TIMES AND AVALANCHE\nDISTRIBUTIONS\n\nIn this Appendix we recall the basic method of the backward diffusion equation to compute distributions of first pas-\n\n\f34\nsage times on a half line and an interval, and then extend it\nto compute the first-passage-time distribution in the velocitydiffusion equation of the ABBM model.\n1. First-passage-time distribution on a half line\n\nLet us call T (w\u2032 ; w) the first-passage time at w\u2032 of a BM\nstarting at position w < w\u2032 at time 0.

To see that, one introduces the diffusion kernel\non x \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, w\u2032 ] in presence of an absorbing boundary at\nx = w\u2032 , which satisfies:\n2\n\u2202t P = D\u2202x2 P \u2212 b\u2202x P = D\u2202w\nP + b\u2202w P\n(E3)\n\u2032\nP (x, t = 0|w, 0) = \u03b4(x \u2212 w) , P (w , t|w, 0) = 0\n\nBy definition of the exit time one has for p > 0:\nZ \u221e\nZ\ndt e\u2212pt \u2202t\nP (x, t|w, 0)\nG(w\u2032 , p; w) = \u2212\n0\nx<w \u2032\nZ\nP\u0302 (x, p|w, 0) ,\n(E4)\n=1\u2212p\nx<w \u2032\n\nwith P\u0302 the Laplace transform of P . The latter satisfies:\n2\npP\u0302 (x, p|w, 0)\u2212\u03b4(x\u2212w) = (D\u2202w\n+b\u2202w )P\u0302 (x, p|w, 0) . (E5)\n\nMultiplying with \u2212p and integrating over x from \u2212\u221e to w\u2032\nyields (E2).\nThe solution of (E2) including the boundary conditions is\n!\np\n2\nb\n\u2212\n4pD\n+\nb\n(w\u2032 \u2212 w) .

Eq.

First-passage-time distribution on an interval\n\nConsider now a Brownian starting at w in an interval\n[wa , wb ]. Consider the functions Ga (w, p), Gb (w, p) and\nG(w, p) = Ga (w, p) + Gb (w, p) which satisfy the same differential equation (E2) but with boundary conditions:\nGa (wa , p) = 1 ,\nGb (wb , p) = 1 ,\n\nGa (wb , p) = 0\nGb (wa , p) = 0\n\n(E13)\n\nThen G(w, p) = he\u2212pTab (w) i is the generating function for\nthe first exit time Tab (w) of the interval [wa , wb ] by a walker\nstarting at w \u2208 [wa , wb ] at time zero. It satisfies (E2) with\nboundary conditions G(wa , p) = 1 and G(wb , p) = 1. One\nfinds:\nsinh(\u03bc(wb \u2212 w))\nsinh(\u03bc(wb \u2212 wa ))\nb\nsinh(\u03bc(w \u2212 wa ))\nGb (w, p) = e 2D (wb \u2212w)\nsinh(\u03bc(wb \u2212 wa ))\n1 p\n4Dp + b2\n\u03bc=\n2D\nb\n\nGa (w, p) = e 2D (wa \u2212w)\n\n(E14)\n(E15)\n(E16)\n\n\f35\nOne checks that G(w, p = 0) irrespective of the sign of b as\nthe walk is certain to exit the interval.

The\nsmall avalanche cutoff s0 , necessary since 1/s\u03c4 is not normalizable at small s for \u03c4 > 1, is provided by v,v\u2032 and its full\nform can in principle be obtained by inverse Laplace transform from p to s of (E24).

It is then easy to inverse Laplace transform (E24) in\nthat limit and to obtain the probability that if the velocity at\nu = 0 is v, then the next stopping point u\u2032 is in the interval\nu\u2032 \u2208 [s, s + ds] as:\nG(0, s; v)ds =\ns0 = v2 /(4\u03c3) ,\n\n1 ds s0 \u03bc \u2212s0 /s\n( ) e\n\u0393(\u03bc) s s\n\u03bc = (1 \u2212 x)/2\n\n(E27)\n(E28)\n\nNext one can use the stationary distribution to find the probability that choosing a u = 0 the next stopping point is at s:\nZ \u221e\nm2 x\n2\u03c3\n(\ndvG(0, s; v)Peq (v) =\n) (4\u03c3)\u2212\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u0393(\u03bc)\u0393(x)vs\n\u03c3\n0\n\nwhere to be consistent we have assumed s \u226a sm = \u03c3/m4 .\nFor x > 1, the probability of ever reaching v\u2032 > 0 is G(p =\n\u2032\n0) = ( vv )x\u22121 < 1, from (E24).

On the other hand, the total area of the hysteresis\nloops per unit length cannot vanish\n- in fact from (F5) we can\n\u221a\nguess that it should grow as w. Hence by contrast with the\ncase of the uncorrelated force landscape, these two quantities\ncannot be equal.\nTo understand this apparent paradox let us note that to insure u(w = 0) = 0 one needs to impose rather strong conditions, e.g. F (u) = 0 for all u \u2264 0. Otherwise, there is a nonzero probability that the BM has taken values \u03c6(u) > w = 0\nin the past, i.e. for u < 0, which is in contradiction with\nu(w = 0) = 0. If we now want to use the hysteresis loop argument in a symmetric way, it would require a similar choice\nat some prescribed u(w = W ) = 0. But then (F2) and (206)\ndo not hold anymore (it holds for a Brownian unconstrained\nin the future). Since that procedure produces a non-stationary\nresult, we do not discuss it further.\n2.\n\nA more generic situation\n\nFirst note that shifting F (u) by a constant leaves (200) unchanged, but also shifts w \u2212 u(w) while it does not change\n\n\f37\nthe area of the hysteresis loop. Hence comparing fc (m) =\nm2 [w \u2212 u(w)] with the area of the hysteresis loop makes\nsense only for a statistically symmetric landscape. To get\nrid of this unimportant shift we can consider a distribution\nof forces symmetric around zero by setting F (u = 0) = 0.\nThis is one way to fix the problematic zero mode of the Brownian landscape. This does not mean that u1 := u(w = 0)\nis necessarily at zero. u1 is the position of the first crossing\nof \u03c6(u) = w = 0 by the BM. The probability distribution of\nu1 \u2264 0 is given by (see Appendix E):\nm2\n\n\u03a0last (u1 ) = p\ne\n4\u03c0\u03c3|u1 |\n\n\u2212m4 |u1 |/(4\u03c3)\n\n\u03b8(\u2212u1 )\n\n(F6)\n\nThis yields a critical force:\n\nfc (m) = \u2212m2 u1 =\n\n2\u03c3\nm2\n\n(F7)\n\nwhich makes more sense, i.e. it is positive and obeys the expected scaling.\nHowever, to be a bit more general, what we have just computed is the conditional probability Pw1 (u1 |F (ua ) = fa ) with\nthe choice ua = 0 and fa = 0 (which can be realized using\nshifts of the axis) and the additional choice w1 = ua \u2212 fa /m2\n(hence w1 = 0). One wonders whether the critical force depends on that choice.\nTo answer this question, we need to compute\nPw1 (u1 |F (0) = 0) as a function of w1 . There are two\ncases: If w1 < 0 then u1 \u2265 0 and one has\nPw1 \u22640 (u1 |F (0) = 0)\n\n= \u03b8(\u2212u1 )LT\u22121\np\u2192\u2212u1 Gb=|b| (|w1 |, p; 0)\u03a0last (p) .\n\n(F8)\n\nThis gives\n(|b||u1 |\u2212|w1 |)2\n|b|\n\u2212\n4D|u1 |\n.\ne\nPw1 \u22640 (u1 |F (0) = 0) = \u03b8(\u2212u1 ) p\n4\u03c0D|u1 |\n\nOne finds\nZ\n2D |w1 |\ndu1 u1 Pw1 \u22640 (u1 |F (0) = 0) = \u2212 2 \u2212\nb\n|b|\n\nHence we find, setting |b| = 1 and D = \u03c3/m4 , conditioned\nto F (0) = 0:\nm2 [w1 \u2212 u(w1 )] = 2\u03c3/m2 ,\n\nw1 \u2264 0\n\nm2 [w1 \u2212 u(w1 )] = 2(m2 w1 + \u03c3/m2 )e\u2212m\n\n(F12)\n4\n\nw1 /\u03c3\n\n,\n\nw1 \u2265 0\n\nFor the past (w1 \u2264 0) one recovers the previous result, while\nfor the future it decreases to zero at large w1 .\nWe could try to generalize further by picking a ua and averaging over fa with some distribution. Using the condition\nw = u \u2212 F (u)/m2 one can check that:\nPw1 (u1 |F (ua ) = fa ) = Pw1 \u2212ua +fa /m2 (u1 \u2212 ua |F (0) = 0)\nHence we can use the previous calculation. For fixed w1 , ua\nand fa one has:\nZ\n2\nm\ndu1 (w1 \u2212 u1 )Pw1 (u1 |F (ua ) = fa )\nZ\n= m2 du1 (w1 \u2212 u1 )Pw1 \u2212ua +fa /m2 (u1 \u2212 ua |F (0) = 0)\nZ\n2\n=m\ndu\u20321 (w1\u2032 \u2212 fa /m2 \u2212 u\u20321 )Pw1\u2032 (u\u20321 |F (0) = 0)\n\uf8f1\nfor w1 \u2212 ua + fa /m2 \u2264 0\n\uf8f2 2\u03c3/m2 \u2212 fa ,\n4 \u2032\n2\n\u2032\n2\n\u2212m\nw1 /\u03c3\n= 2(m w1 + \u03c3/m )e\n\u2212 fa\n\uf8f3\nfor w1\u2032 = w1 \u2212 ua + fa /m2 \u2265 0\n\n(F13)\n\nwhich can, in principle, be averaged on fa . It is not clear\nhowever at this stage which distribution to choose and how\nto relate these quantities to the area of the hysteresis loop.\nFurther work is needed to clarify these issues.\n\n(F9)\nAPPENDIX G: FIRST RETURN PROBABILITIES IN d\nDIMENSIONS\n\nIf w1 > 0 there are two subcases, and the total reads:\nPw1 \u22650 (u1 |F (0) = 0)\n\n= \u03b8(\u2212u1 )LT\u22121\np\u2192\u2212u1 Gb=\u2212|b| (w1 , p; 0)\u03a0last (p)\n+\u03b8(u1 )LT\u22121\np\u2192u1 Gb=|b| (w1 , p; 0)\n\u00d7(1 \u2212 Gb=\u2212|b| (w1 , p = 0; 0))\n\nwhich can be checked to be correctly normalized.

If the force landscape is smooth at short scale u0 , (233)\nholds only for s0 \u226b u0 . For s0 \u2264 u0 the short-scale cutoff\nfunction for P (s) is more complicated, but this has no consequence for the behavior for s0 \u226a s \u226a sm still given by\n(233). In the\n\u221a small v limit, there is a further crossover velocity vc = 4\u03c3u0 below which the short-scale cutoff function\nprogressively becomes the one of the quasi-static limit.\n[97] One can also set Xi = \u2212Fi /m2 and c = 1 as in Section VI.\n[98] With the same method one can obtain the difference in value w\nwith the next record.\n[99] Note that in fact this was already the case for some members of\n\n\f41\n1.
