For an introduction to the\nsubject, its connections with other areas and an exposition of the techniques\nused, we refer to the book [8]. Usually, one distinguishes hard obstacles,\nwhere the particle is killed upon hitting them, and soft obstacles where the\nparticle is only killed with a certain probability. A typical model treated\nextensively in [8] is Brownian motion in a Poissonian field of obstacles. The\nfollowing questions arise for this model: what is the asymptotic behaviour\nof the survival time? What is the best strategy of survival, i.e. what is\nthe conditioned behaviour of the particle, given that it has survived until\ntime n? An important role in answering these questions has been played by\nthe concept of \"pockets of low local eigenvalues\" (again, we refer to [8] for\nexplanations). A key distinction in random media is the difference between\nthe quenched probability measure (where one fixes the environment) and the\nannealed probability measure (where one averages over the environment).\nIn this paper, we are considering a discrete model with soft obstacles\nwhere there are two sources of randomness in the environment: the particle has random transition probabilities (which are assigned to the sites of\nthe lattice in an i.i.d. way and then fixed for all times) and the obstacles\nare also placed randomly on the lattice and then their positions remain unchanged. We investigate the tails of the survival time. Similar questions have\nbeen asked in [1] for simple random walk. The \"pockets of low local eigenvalues\" are in our case \"traps free of obstacles\": these are regions without\nobstacles, where the transition probabilities are such that the particle tends\nto spend a long time there before escaping. These regions are responsible\nfor the possibility of large survival time. We assume that the environments\n(transition probabilities and obstacles) in all sites are independent and obtain quenched and annealed bounds on the tails of the survival time in the\n2\n\n\fgeneral d-dimensional case. We then consider a simplified one-dimensional\nmodel (where transition probabilities and obstacles are independent and the\nRWRE only moves to neighbour sites), and obtain finer results for the tail of\nthe survival time. Having two sources of randomness in the environment, we\nstudy also the \"mixed\" probability measures (quenched with respect to the\nobstacles and annealed with respect to the transition probabilities and viceversa) and give results for the tails of the survival time with respect to these\nprobability measures. Further, we develop the analogy with the branching\nrandom walks in random environment (BRWRE) [4, 5], and provide quenched\nand annealed bounds for hitting times in the BRWRE model.\nNow we define the model formally. Denote by e1 , . . . , ed the coordinate\nvectors, and let k * k1 and k * k2 stand for the L1 and L2 norms in Zd respectively. The environment consists of the set of transition probabilities\n\u03c9 = (\u03c9x (y), x, y \u2208 Zd ), and the set of variables indicating the locations of\nthe obstacles \u03b8 = (\u03b8x , x \u2208 Zd ), where \u03b8x = 1{there is an obstacle in x}. Let\nus denote by \u03c3x = (\u03c9x (*), \u03b8x ) the environment in x \u2208 Zd , and \u03c3 = (\u03c9, \u03b8) =\n(\u03c3x , x \u2208 Zd ) stands for the (global) environment. We suppose that jumps\nare uniformly bounded by some constant m,\ne which means that \u03c9x (y) = 0 if\nkx \u2212 yk1 > m.\ne Let us denote by M the environment space where the \u03c3x are\ndefined, i.e.\nn\n\u0001\nM = (a(y))y\u2208Zd , b : a(y) \u2265 0, \u2200y \u2208 Zd ,\no\nX\nX\na(y) = 1 =\na(y), b \u2208 {0, 1} .\ny\u2208Zd\n\ny:kyk1 \u2264m\ne\n\nWe assume that (\u03c3x , x \u2208 Zd ) is a collection of i.i.d. random variables. We\ndenote by P the corresponding product measure, and by E its expectation.\nIn some cases these assumptions may be relaxed, see Remark 1.3 below.\nLet\np = P[\u03b80 = 1].\nWe always assume 0 < p < 1.\nHaving fixed the realization of the random environment \u03c3, we now define\nthe random walk \u03be and the random time \u03c4 as follows. The discrete time random walk \u03ben starts from some z0 \u2208 Zd and moves according to the transition\nprobabilities\nP\u03c3z0 [\u03ben+1 = x + y | \u03ben = x] = \u03c9x (y).\n3\n\n\fHere P\u03c3z0 stands for the so-called quenched probability (i.e., with fixed environment \u03c3) and we denote by Ez\u03c30 the corresponding expectation. Usually,\nwe shall assume that the random walk starts from the origin, so that z0 = 0;\nin this case we use the simplified notations P\u03c3 , E\u03c3 .\nFix r \u2208 (0, 1) and let Z1 , Z2 , . . . be a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random\nvariables with P\u03c3 [Zi = 1] = r. Denote by \u0398 = {x \u2208 Zd : \u03b8x = 1} the set of\nsites where the obstacles are placed. Let\n\u03c4 = min{n : \u03ben \u2208 \u0398, Zn = 1}.\nIntuitively, when the RWRE hits an obstacle, it \"disappears\" with probability r, and \u03c4 is the survival time of the particle.\nWe shall also consider the annealed probability law Pz0 = P \u00d7 P\u03c3z0 [*], and\nthe corresponding expectation Ez0 = EEz\u03c30 . Again, when the random walk\nstarts from the origin, we use the simplified notations P, E.\nThroughout this paper we suppose that that the environment \u03c3 satisfies\nthe following two conditions.\nCondition E. There exists \u03b50 > 0 such that \u03c9x (e) \u2265 \u03b50 for all e \u2208 {\u00b1ei , i =\n1, . . . , d}, P-a.s.\nFor (\u03c9, \u03b8) \u2208 M, let\n\n\u2206\u03c9 =\n\nX\n\ny\u03c9(y)\n\n(1)\n\ny\n\nbe the drift of \u03c9.\nCondition N. We have\nP[\u03b80 = 0, \u2206\u03c9 * a > 0] > 0 for all a \u2208 Rd \\ {0}.\nCondition E is a natural (uniform) ellipticity condition; Condition N is a\nstandard condition for RWRE and assures that the environment has \"traps\"\n(i.e., pieces of the environment free from obstacles from where it takes a long\ntime to escape). Let us emphasize that in this paper the term \"trap\" does\nnot refer to the disappearing of the particle; on the contrary, by \"the particle\nis trapped in some place\" we usually mean that the particle stays alive but\nis likely to remain in that place for a long time. Observe that Condition N\nimplies that the RWRE is (strictly) nestling, i.e. the origin is in the interior\nof the convex hull of the support of \u2206\u03c9 .\n4\n\n\fOur goal is to study the quenched and annealed tails of the distribution\nof \u03c4 : P\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n] and P[\u03c4 > n].\nFirst, we formulate the results on the tails of \u03c4 in the d-dimensional case\nunder the above assumptions:\nTheorem 1.1 For all d \u2265 1 there exist Kia (d) > 0, i = 1, 2, such that for\nall n\nP[\u03c4 > n] \u2264 exp(\u2212K1a (d) lnd n),\n(2)\nand\nP[\u03c4 > n] \u2265 exp(\u2212K2a (d) lnd n).\n\n(3)\n\nTheorem 1.2 For d \u2265 1 there exist Kiq (d) > 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 (also with the\nproperty Kjq (1) < 1 for j = 2, 4), such that for P-almost all \u03c3 there exists\nn0 (\u03c3) such that for all n \u2265 n0 (\u03c3) we have\n\u0001\nP\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n] \u2264 exp \u2212 K1q (d)n exp(\u2212K2q (d) ln1/d n) ,\n(4)\nand\n\n\u0001\nP\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n] \u2265 exp \u2212 K3q (d)n exp(\u2212K4q (d) ln1/d n) .\n\n(5)\n\nIn fact (as it will be discussed in Section 2) the original motivation for\nthe model of this paper came from the study of the hitting times for branching random walks in random environment (BRWRE), see [4]. The above\nTheorem 1.1 has direct counterparts in [4], namely, Theorems 1.8 and 1.9.\nHowever, the problem of finding upper and lower bounds on the quenched\ntails of the hitting times was left open in that paper (except for the case\nd = 1). Now, Theorem 1.2 of the present paper allows us to obtain the analogous bounds also for the model of [4]. The model of [4] can be described\nas follows. Particles live in Zd and evolve in discrete time. At each time,\nevery particle in a site is substituted by (possibly more than one but at least\none) offspring which are placed in neighbour sites, independently of the other\nparticles. The rules of offspring generation (similarly to the notation of the\npresent paper, they are given by \u03c9x at site x) depend only on the location\nof the particle. Similarly to the situation of this paper, the collection \u03c9 of\nthose rules (the environment) is itself random, it is chosen in an i.i.d. way\nbefore starting the process, and then it is kept fixed during all the subsequent\nevolution of the particle system. We denote by \u03c9 a generic element of the\nset of all possible environments at a given point, and we distinguish \u03c9 with\n5\n\n\fbranching (the particle can be replaced with several particles) and \u03c9 without branching (the particle can only be replaced with exactly one particle).\nThe BRWRE is called recurrent if for almost all environments in the process\n(starting with one particle at the origin), all sites are visited (by some particle) infinitely often a.s. Using the notations of [4] (in particular, P\u03c9 stands\nfor the quenched probability law of the BRWRE), we have the following\nProposition 1.1 Suppose that the BRWRE is recurrent and uniformly elliptic. Let T (0, x0 ) be the hitting time of x0 for the BRWRE starting from 0.\nb q (d) > 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, such that for almost all environThen, there exist K\ni\nments \u03c9, there exists n0 (\u03c9) such that for all n \u2265 n0 (\u03c9) we have\n\u0001\nb q (d)n exp(\u2212K\nb q (d) ln1/d n) .\nP\u03c9 [T (0, x0 ) > n] \u2264 exp \u2212 K\n1\n2\n\n(6)\n\nNow, let G be the set of all \u03c9 without branching. Suppose that it has positive\nprobability and the origin belongs to the interior of the convex hull of {\u2206\u03c9 :\n\u03c9 \u2208 G \u2229 supp P}, where \u2206\u03c9 is the drift from a site with environment \u03c9.\nSuppose also that there is \u03b5\u03020 such that\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP P\u03c9 [total number of particles at time 1 is 1] \u2265 \u03b5\u03020 = 1,\ni.e., for almost all environments, in any site the particle does not branch with\nuniformly positive probability. Then\n\u0001\nb 3q (d)n exp(\u2212K\nb 4q (d) ln1/d n) .\nP\u03c9 [T (0, x0 ) > n] \u2265 exp \u2212 K\n(7)\n\nNow, we go back to the random walk among soft obstacles. In the onedimensional case, we are able to obtain finer results. We assume now that\nthe transition probabilities and the obstacles are independent, in other words,\nP = \u03bc \u2297 \u03bd, where \u03bc, \u03bd are two product measures governing, respectively, the\ntransition probabilities and the obstacles. We further assume m\ne = 1 and\n+\n+\n\u2212\nwe denote \u03c9x = \u03c9x (+1) and \u03c9x = 1 \u2212 \u03c9x = \u03c9x (\u22121). Condition N is now\nequivalent to\ninf{a : \u03bc(\u03c90+ \u2264 a) > 0} < 1/2,\n(8)\nsup{a : \u03bc(\u03c90+ \u2265 a) > 0} > 1/2,\ni.e., the RWRE is strictly nestling.

A similar\nargument implies that \u03bal is well-defined.\nWe now are able to characterize the quenched and annealed tails of \u03c4 in\nthe following way:\nTheorem 1.3 For d = 1\nln P[\u03c4 > n]\n= \u2212(\u03bal (p) + \u03bar (p)).\nn\u2192\u221e\nln n\n\n(12)\n\nlim\n\nTheorem 1.4 For d = 1\n\u03bal (p) + \u03bar (p)\nln(\u2212 ln P\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n])\n=\nn\u2192\u221e\nln n\n1 + \u03bal (p) + \u03bar (p)\nlim\n\nP-a.s.\n\n(13)\n\nIn our situation, besides the quenched and the annealed probabilities, one\ncan also consider two \"mixed\" ones: the probability measure P\u03c9z = \u03bd \u00d7 P\u03c3z\nwhich is quenched in \u03c9 and annealed in \u03b8 and the probability measure P\u03b8z =\n\u03bc\u00d7P\u03c3z which is quenched in \u03b8 and annealed in \u03c9.

However, if one\nmodifies Condition N in a suitable way, we conjecture that Theorem 1.1 and\nTheorem 1.2 remain true if the environment is not i.i.d. but finitely dependent\n(for BRWRE, one can find generalizations of this kind in [5]).\n\n2\n\nProofs: multi-dimensional case\n\nIn this section, we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. In fact, the ideas we need\nto prove these results are similar to those in the proofs of Theorems 1.8\nand 1.9 of [4]. In the following, we explain the relationship of the discussion\nin [4] with our model, and give the proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, sometimes\nreferring to [4] for a more detailed account.\nProof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. The proof of (2) follows essentially the proof\nof Theorem 1.8 of [4], where it is shown that the tail of the first hitting\ntime of some fixed site x0 (one may think also of the first return time to\nthe origin) can be bounded from above as in (2). The main idea is that,\nas a general fact, for any recurrent BRWRE there are the so-called recurrent seeds. These are simply finite configurations of the environment, where,\nwith positive probability, the number of particles grows exponentially without help from outside (i.e., suppose that all particles that step outside this\nfinite piece are killed; then, the number of particles in the seed dominates a\nsupercritical Galton-Watson process, which explodes with positive probability). Then, we consider an embedded RWRE, until it hits a recurrent seed\nand the supercritical Galton-Watson process there explodes (afterwards, the\nparticles created by this explosion are used to find the site x0 , but here this\npart is only needed for Proposition 1.1).\n9\n\n\fSo, going back to the model of this paper, obstacles play the role of recurrent seeds, and the moment \u03c4 when the event {\u03ben \u2208 \u0398, Zn = 1} happens\nfor the first time is analogous to the moment of the first explosion of the\nGalton-Watson process in the recurrent seed. To explain better this analogy,\nconsider the following situation. Suppose that, outside the recurrent seeds\nthere is typically a strong drift in one direction and the branching is very\nweak or absent. Then, the qualitative behaviour of the process is quite different before and after the first explosion. Before, we typically observe very\nfew (possibly even one) particles with more or less ballistic behaviour; after,\nthe cloud of particles starts to grow exponentially in one place (in the recurrent seed where the explosion occurs), and so the cloud of particles expands\nlinearly in all directions. So, the first explosion of one of the Galton-Watson\nprocesses in recurrent seeds marks the transition between qualitatively different behaviours of the BRWRE, and thus it is analogous to the moment \u03c4\nof the model of the present paper.\nFirst, we prove (2) for d \u2265 2. For any a \u2208 Z, define Ka = [\u2212a, a]d .

Clearly, we have for d \u2265 2\nP[Mnc ] \u2264 C1 nd exp(\u2212C2 lnd n).\n\n(22)\n\nNow, suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 Mn . So, for any possible location of the particle\nup to time n, we can find a site with an obstacle which is not more than \u03b1 ln n\naway from that location (in the sense of L1 -distance). This means that, on\nany time interval of length \u03b1 ln n, the particle will disappear (i.e., \u03c4 is in this\ninterval if the particle has not disappeared before) with probability at least\nr\u03b5\u03b10 ln n , where \u03b50 is the constant from the uniform ellipticity condition.

Then,\nthe annealed upper bound (2) for d = 1 follows from (4) and (26).\nNow, let us prove the lower bound (3). This time, we proceed as in the\nproof of Theorem 1.9 from [4]. Denote by Sd\u22121 = {x \u2208 Rd : kxk2 = 1} the\nunit sphere in Rd , and, recalling (1), let \u2206\u03c9 be the drift at the point (\u03c9, \u03b8) \u2208\nM.

The cost of constructing piece of environment of size N (i.e., containing N sites) with such\nproperties does not exceed pN\n1 (item (ii)).\nd\nConsider any z \u2208 Z , B \u2282 Zd and a collection H = (Hx \u2286 M, x \u2208 B);\nlet us define\nS(z, B, H) = {\u03c3 : \u03c3z+x \u2208 Hx for all x \u2208 B}.\nIn [4], on S(z, B, H) we said that there is an (B, H)-seed in z; for the model\nof this paper, however, we prefer not to use the term \"seed\", since the role\nseeds play in [4] is quite different from the use of environments belonging\nto S(z, B, H) here.

Now, we explain how to obtain Proposition 1.1.\nTo prove (6), we proceed as in the proof of (4). As noted in the beginning\nof this section, the disappearing of the particle in an obstacle is analogous\nto starting an exploding Galton-Watson process in a recurrent seed. Denote\nby Te the moment when this happens, i.e., at least eC19 k new particles are\ncreated in this recurrent seed by time Te + k. Thus, one can obtain a bound\nof the form\n\u0001\nP\u03c9 [Te > n] \u2264 exp \u2212 C20 n exp(\u2212C21 ln1/d n) .\nThen, using the uniform ellipticity, it is straightforward to obtain that, waiting C22 n time units more (with large enough C22 ), one of the newly created\n(in this recurrent seed) particles will hit x0 with probability at least 1\u2212e\u2212C23 n ,\nand this implies (6).\nTo show (7), we note that, analogously to the proof of (5) that we are\n1/d\nable to create a seed which\n\u221a is free of branching sites of diameter C24 ln n,\nwhich lies at distance O( n) from the origin. Then, the same idea works:\nthe initial particle goes straight to the seed without creating new particles,\nand then stays there up to time n. The detailed proof goes along the lines\nof the proof of (5) only with notational adjustments.\n\u0003\n\n3\n3.1\n\nProofs: one-dimensional case\nPreliminaries\n\nWe define the potential, which is a function of the transition probabilities.\nUnder our assumptions it is a sum of i.i.d. random variables.

Suppose also that a\u2032 has maximal potential on [a, b] and c\u2032 has maximal potential on [b, c]. Then, for any x \u2208 (a\u2032 , c\u2032 ), it is straightforward to obtain a\nlower bound for the probability of confinement in the following way: write\nP\u03c3x [T{a,c} \u2265 t] \u2265 P\u03c3x [T{a\u2032 ,c\u2032 } \u2265 t], and then use Lemma 3.5 for the second term.\nThis reasoning will usually be left implicit when we use Lemma 3.5 in the\nrest of this paper.\n\n3.2\n\nProofs of Theorems 1.3\u20131.6.\n\nProof of Theorem 1.3. By Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.5, we have for all b1 , b2 \u2208\n(0, \u221e) and any \u03b5 > 0,\nP[\u03c4 > n] \u2265 P[A0 (1, b1 , b2 , n)]\n\u00d7\ninf\nP\u03c3 [\u03bet \u2208 (\u2212b1 ln n, b2 ln n), for all t \u2264 n]\n0\n\u03c3\u2208A (1,b1 ,b2 ,n)\n\n\u2265 C1 n(b1 +b2 ) ln(1\u2212p)\u2212\u03c8(1,b1 ,b2 )\u2212\u03b5\nfor all n large enough. Thus, recalling that\ne = inf {\u2212(b1 + b2 ) ln(1 \u2212 p) + \u03c8(1, b1 , b2 )},\n\u03c8(1)\nb1 ,b2 >0\n\nwe obtain\n\ne\n\nP[\u03c4 > n] \u2265 C2 n\u2212\u03c8(1)\u2212\u03b5 .\n\n(46)\n\nLet us now obtain an upper bound on P[\u03c4 > n]. Fix n, \u03b2 > 0, 0 < \u03b4 < 1.\nWe say that the environment \u03c3 is good, if the maximal (obstacle free) trap\ndepth is less than (1 \u2212 \u03b4) ln n in the interval [\u2212 ln1+\u03b2 n, ln1+\u03b2 n], that is, for\nall b1 , b2 > 0, x \u2208 [\u2212 ln1+\u03b2 n, ln1+\u03b2 n] the event Ax (1 \u2212 \u03b4, b1 , b2 , n) does not\noccur, and also\nmin{|\u0398 \u2229 [\u2212 ln1+\u03b2 n, 0]|, |\u0398 \u2229 [0, ln1+\u03b2 n]|} \u2265\n24\n\np ln1+\u03b2 n\n.\n2\n\n\fFor any \u03b5 > 0 we obtain that for all large enough n\ne\n\n1+\u03b2\n\nP[\u03c3 is not good] \u2264 C3 n\u2212\u03c8(1\u2212\u03b4)+\u03b5 ln\u03b2 n + e\u2212C4 ln\n\nn\n\n,\n\n(47)\n\nby Lemma 3.1.\nNote that if \u03c3 is good, then for every interval [a, b] \u2282 [\u2212 ln1+\u03b2 n, ln1+\u03b2 n]\nsuch that a, b \u2208 \u0398, \u0398 \u2229 (a, b) = \u2205 we have\nmax V (x) \u2212 min V (x) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) ln n.\n\nx\u2208[a,b]\n\nx\u2208[a,b]\n\nThus, for such an interval [a, b], on the event {\u03c3 is good}, Lemma 3.4 (with\nu = n\u03b4/2 ) implies that for any x \u2208 [a, b] we have\nh\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b4\nP\u03c3 \u03bet \u2208\n/ [a, b] for some t \u2264 n1\u2212 2 | \u03be0 = x \u2265 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n\ni\nn\u03b4/2\n.

First we obtain a lower bound on P\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n]. Fix a\nand let b1 , b2 be such that\ne\n\u03c8(a)\n= \u2212(b1 + b2 ) ln(1 \u2212 p) + \u03c8(a, b1 , b2 ).\n\nLet us show that such b1 , b2 actually exist, that is, the infimum in (38) is\nattained. For that, one may reason as follows. First, since \u03c8 \u2265 0, for any M0\nthere is M1 > 0 such that if min{b1 , b2 } \u2265 M1 then\n\u2212 (b1 + b2 ) ln(1 \u2212 p) + \u03c8(a, b1 , b2 ) \u2265 M0 .\n\n(50)\n\nThen, it is clear that for any fixed h > 0 we have limb2 \u21930 sup\u03bb>0 (\u03bbh\u2212b2 E\u03c1\u03bb0 ) =\n+\u221e, so (also with the analogous fact for \u03c110 ) we obtain that for any M0 there\nexists \u03b5 > 0 such that if min{b1 , b2 } < \u03b5 then (50) holds. Thus, one may\nsuppose that in (38) b1 and b2 vary over a compact set, and so the infimum\nis attained.\nLet us call such a trap (with b1 , b2 chosen as above) an a-optimal trap.\nNote that\nln P[A0 (a, b1 , b2 , n)]\ne\n\u2212\u03c8(a)\n= lim\n.\nn\u2192\u221e\nln n\ne\ne = 0 and 1 \u2212 a\nNote also that, since \u03c8(a)\nis an increasing function with \u03c8(0)\ne\nis a decreasing function, there exists unique a such that 1 \u2212 a = \u03c8(a).\ne\n\ne\n\nFix \u03b5\u2032 < 2\u03b5 . Consider an interval [\u2212n\u03c8(a)+\u03b5 , n\u03c8(a)+\u03b5 ].

The factor (r\u03b50)n\nappears in (51) because\nthe random walk should first reach the obstacle free a-optimal trap, and on\nits way in the worst case it could meet obstacles in every site.\nTo obtain the upper bound, take \u03b4 > 0 and consider the time intervals\nIk = [(1 + \u03b4)k , (1 + \u03b4)k+1).

Consider the event\nA = {\u03bet \u2208\n/ [\u2212n\u03b3 , n\u03b3 ] for some t \u2264 n}.\nWe then have\nP\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n] = P\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n, A] + P\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n, Ac ]\n\u2264 (1 \u2212 r)n\n\n\u03b3 (\u03b1 ln n)\u22121\n\n+ ((1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 e\u2212C1 n\n\n\u03b4/2\n\n))n\n\n1\u2212Fe \u03b1\u2212\u03b4\n\n.\n\nSince \u03b4 is arbitrary, analogously to the derivation of (57) from (56) one can\nobtain\n| ln(1 \u2212 p)|\nln(\u2212 ln P\u03b8 [\u03c4 > n])\nlim inf\n\u2265\n.\nn\u2192\u221e\nln n\n| ln(1 \u2212 p)| + Fe\n\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 1.5.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 1.6. Define\nRn\u03b5,+ (\u03c9) = min{x > 0 : in (0, x) there is a trap of depth (1 \u2212 \u03b5) ln n},\nRn\u03b5,\u2212 (\u03c9) = min{x > 0 : in (\u2212x, 0) there is a trap of depth (1 \u2212 \u03b5) ln n},\nand let Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9) = min{Rn\u03b5,+ (\u03c9), Rn\u03b5,\u2212 (\u03c9)}. For \u03b5 = 0, denote Rn (\u03c9) :=\nRn0 (\u03c9). The statements for Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9) and Rn (\u03c9) now follow from the definition\nof these random variables and the invariance principle.\nProof of (i). To obtain a lower bound, we just observe that by Lemma 3.5,\nwhen the random walk is in a trap of depth ln n, it will stay there up to\ntime n with a probability bounded away from 0 (say, by C1 ). Further, with \u03bdprobability (1 \u2212p)Rn (\u03c9)+1 there will be no obstacles in the interval [0, Rn (\u03c9)].\nThus, by the uniform ellipticity,\nR (\u03c9)\n\nP\u03c9 [\u03c4 > n] \u2265 C1 (1 \u2212 p)Rn (\u03c9)+1 \u03b50 n\n\n\u2265 e\u2212K2 Rn (\u03c9) .\n\nTo obtain an upper bound, we say that \u03b8 is k-good, if\n\u0398 \u2229 [\u2212j, 0] \u2265\n\npj\n2\n\nand\n\n\u0398 \u2229 [0, j] \u2265\n\npj\n2\n\nfor all j \u2265 k. Then,\n\u03b5\n\n\u03bd[\u03b8 is not Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9)-good] \u2264 e\u2212C2 Rn (\u03c9) .\n30\n\n(58)\n\n\fBy Lemma 3.4, for all large enough n\n\u03b5/2\n\nP\u03c3 [\u03bet \u2208 [\u2212Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9), Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9)] for all t \u2264 n] \u2264 e\u2212C3 n ,\nand so on the event {\u03b8 is Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9)-good}, we have\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\nP\u03c3 [\u03c4 > n] \u2264 e\u2212C3 n + (1 \u2212 r)Rn (\u03c9)p/2 .\nTogether with (58), this proves part (i), since it is elementary to obtain\nthat Rn\u03b5 is subpolynomial for almost all \u03c9. Indeed, as discussed in Remark 1.1, a comparison to [7] suggests that, for C4 large enough, Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9) \u2264\nC4 ln2 n ln ln ln n for all but finitely many n, \u03bc-a.s. Anyhow, one can obtain\na weaker result which is still enough for our needs: Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9) \u2264 ln4 n \u03bc-a.s.\nfor all but finitely many n, with the following reasoning: any interval of\nlength ln2 n contains a trap of depth at least ln n with constant probability.\nSo, dividing [\u2212 ln4 n, ln4 n] into subintervals of length ln2 n, one can see that\n2\n\u03bc[\u03c9 : Rn\u03b5 (\u03c9) \u2265 ln4 n] \u2264 e\u2212C5 ln n and use the Borel-Cantelli lemma.\n\n\u03ba\nProof of (ii). Take a = \u03ba+1\nand 0 < \u03b5 < a/\u03ba. In this case, by Lemma 3.3\n\u0001\na\nthere is a trap of depth \u03ba \u2212 \u03b5 ln n on the interval [0, na ), a.s. for all n large\nenough. Using Lemma 3.5, when the random walk enters this trap, it stays\n\u0001\na\nthere up to time n with probability at least 2n1a exp \u2212 \u03a53 ln(2na )n1\u2212 \u03ba +\u03b5 .\na\nFurther, the probability that the interval [0, na ) is free of obstacles is (1\u2212p)n ,\nand we obtain\na\n\nP\u03c9 [\u03c4 > n] \u2265 (1 \u2212 p)n \u03b5n0\n\u2265 e\u2212C6 n\n= e\u2212C6 n\n\na\n\na+2\u03b5\n\u03ba\n\u03ba+1 +2\u03b5\n\n\u0001\na\n1\n+\u03b5\na 1\u2212 \u03ba\nexp\n\u2212\n\u03a5\nln(2n\n)n\n3\n2na\n\n,\n\nas a was chosen in such a way that a = 1 \u2212\narbitrary, this yields\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\na\n\u03ba\n\n=\n\n\u03ba\n.\n\u03ba+1\n\nSince \u03b5 > 0 was\n\n\u03ba\nln(\u2212 ln P\u03c9 [\u03c4 > n])\n\u2265\n.\nln n\n\u03ba+1\n\nTo prove the corresponding upper bound, we proceed analogously to the\nproof of (12). We say that the obstacle environment \u03b8 is good (for fixed n),\nif\npna\nmin{|\u0398 \u2229 [\u2212na , 0]|, |\u0398 \u2229 [0, na ]|} \u2265\n.\n2\n31\n\n\fNote that\n\na\n\n\u03bd[\u03b8 is good] \u2265 1 \u2212 e\u2212C7 n .\nLet\nG = {\u03bet \u2208\n/ [\u2212na , na ] for some t \u2264 n}.\n\n1\u2212 a\n\nObserve that, by Theorem 1.2 from [6], we have P\u03c9 [G] \u2264 e\u2212C8 n \u03ba .
