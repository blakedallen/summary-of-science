With inclusion of explicit\nchiral symmetry breaking by the nonvanishing quark\nmasses, this symmetry-breaking pattern is visibly manifest in the spectrum of the low-mass pseudoscalar meson octet for Nf = 3. This octet figures as the massless Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral\nSU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R symmetry in the limit of massless u, d,\nand s quarks. An equivalent but not directly observable\nmanifestation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking\n(S\u03c7SB) is the appearance of a nonzero quark condensate. Its observable counterpart is the pion decay constant, f\u03c0 , which acts as an order parameter for S\u03c7SB and\ndefines a chiral-symmetry-breaking scale, 4\u03c0f\u03c0 \u223c 1 GeV,\nbriefly referred to as the chiral scale. Further evidence\nfor S\u03c7SB is the absence of parity doublets in the lower\nmass area of the hadron spectrum, an important example\nbeing the large mass gap between the \u03c1 (J P = 1\u2212 ) and\na1 (J P = 1+ ) mesons. Thus it is well established that at\nzero temperature, QCD is in the Nambu-Goldstone realization of chiral symmetry. Were it in the Wigner-Weyl\nrealization with a trivial vacuum and parity doublets, the\n\u03c1 and a1 would be degenerate. One expects this latter situation to be reached as the temperature is raised toward\na critical value, Tc \u223c 0.2 GeV, for the chiral transition.\nAround this point and beyond, the \u03c1 and a1 are expected\nto melt into the quark-antiquark continuum.\nLattice QCD results [1, 2] do indicate that the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is restored at high temperature. The spectral functions of chiral partners such\n\n\u2021 Temporary\n\naddress: Yukawa Institute of Theoretical Physics,\nUniversity of Kyoto, Japan\n\u2217 Electronic address: ykwon@ph.tum.de\n\u2020 Electronic address: sasaki@fias.uni-frankfurt.de\n\u00a7 Electronic address: weise@ph.tum.de\n\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\nas the (isovector) vector and and axial-vector mesons are\nthen supposed to become degenerate. In this context,\nconcerning the in-medium behavior of vector mesons,\nmeasurements of dileptons produced in relativistic heavyion collisions have attracted great interest over the past\ndecades (see, e.g., Ref. [3]). Dileptons as well as photons\nare excellent probes carrying information about vector\nmeson spectral functions at the high temperatures and\ndensities reached in the collision zone. In particular, the\n\u03c1 meson, as the lowest dipole excitation of the QCD vacuum, has been in the focus of such investigations.\nThe issue of in-medium hadronic properties persists as\na basic theme ever since the suggestion of Brown and Rho\n(BR) [4] that hadron masses should decrease systematically when a hadronic medium undergoes the transition\ntoward chiral symmetry restoration. The BR scaling hypothesis states that the dropping of hadron masses, with\nthe exception of the pion mass, should go in parallel with\nthe dropping of the pion decay constant f\u03c0 (here the one\nrelated to the time component of the axial current) in\nhot and dense hadronic matter. In general, a sufficient\ncondition for chiral symmetry restoration is that the inmedium mass difference between the \u03c1 and a1 mesons\ntends to zero, although it is not mandatory that the\nmasses vanish individually. In practice, however, these\nmass-shift scenarios are overshadowed by strong spectralbroadening effects. The \u03c1 and a1 resonances have large\nwidths already in the vacuum. Their interactions with\nhadrons in the medium increase their decay widths significantly through collision broadening. Distinguishing\n\"mass shift\" from \"broadening\" scenarios is obviously not\na meaningful issue once the spectral functions become\nvery broad and do not show clear resonance structures.\nIn a situation like this, it nevertheless still makes sense\nto perform a sum-rule analysis of such broad spectral distributions, focusing on their lowest moments and defining\na mean mass through the first moment of the in-medium\nspectral function. Such an analysis is made possible by\nidentifying the characteristic chiral-symmetry-breaking\nscale, \u039bCSB \u2248 4\u03c0f\u03c0 , with the continuum threshold separating the low-energy-resonance region from the highenergy continuum. Consider the example of the vector\n\n\fspectral function, to be specified in detail later:\nRV (s) = RVres (s) \u0398(sV \u2212 s) + RVcont \u0398(s \u2212 sV ) ,\n\nimply that the vacuum a1 and \u03c1 masses satisfy the wellknown relation\n\n(1)\n\nm2A = 2m2V .\n\nwhere RVres (s) denotes the resonance part. This lowenergy part is separated by the scale sV from the highenergy continuum part RVcont determined by perturba\u221a\ntive QCD. In vacuum, the identification sV = 4\u03c0f\u03c0\nis supported by current algebra relations and spectral\nsum rules, as we point out later. The extension to the\ncase of finite baryon density at zero temperature has\nbeen studied in our previous work [5] where it is demonstrated\nthat the aforementioned scale analysis works with\np\nsV (\u03c1) = 4\u03c0f\u03c0\u2217 (\u03c1) now interpreted in terms of the inmedium change of the chiral order parameter.\nBefore turning to finite temperatures, it is useful to\nrecall Weinberg's sum rules [6]. These sum rules are entirely based on current algebra and establish rigorous relations for the difference between vector and axial-vector\nspectral functions:\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds RV (s) \u2212 RA (s) = 0 ,\n(2)\n0\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds s RV (s) \u2212 RA (s) = 0 .\n(3)\n\nThe Weinberg sum rules are based on the observation\nthat chiral symmetry is restored in its Wigner-Weyl realization asymptotically, at high-energy scales, where QCD\nis perturbative. The duality between the resonant and\nasymptotic parts of the spectral functions derived from\ncurrent correlators is one of the basic ideas of QCD sum\nrules, to which we now proceed. The present study constructs finite energy sum rules (FESR) for \u03c1 and a1 meson at nonzero temperature and vanishing baryon chemical potential. We show how finite temperature FESRs\ncan provide constraints for the pattern and trend toward\nchiral symmetry restoration. Realistic vacuum spectral functions are employed as input in comparison with\nschematic \u03b4 function spectra, and the \u03c1-a1 parity-mixing\nscenario is used to describe temperature-dependent effects.\n2.\n\nAssume first the following schematic forms for the vector\nand axial-vector spectral functions:\n(4)\n\n\u0001\n \u0304 \u03bc d and\nwith the vector current jV\u03bc (x) = 21 \u016b\u03b3 \u03bc u \u2212 d\u03b3\n\u0001\n\u03bc\n \u0304 \u03bc \u03b35 d carthe axial-vector current jA\n= 21 \u016b\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 u \u2212 d\u03b3\nrying the quantum numbers of \u03c1 and a1 meson, respectively. The bracket hOiT indicates the thermal expectation value of an operator O,\n\nwhere c0 multiplying the continuum parts of the spectral\nfunctions is determined by perturbative QCD (c0 = 3/2\nin leading order for the \u03c1 and a1 channels). The equality of these vector and axial-vector continuum pieces is\nindicative of chiral symmetry restoration at high energy\nbeyond the scales sV,A . For the resonant parts, choose for\nsimplicity a zero-width ansatz (as realized in the large-Nc\nlimit):\n\nhOiT =\n\nwhere fV /A are dimensionless vector and axial-vector\ncouplings respectively. The a1 spectral function includes\na pion pole term with its residue determined by the pion\ndecay constant f\u03c0 . In the chiral limit (m\u03c0 \u2192 0), and\nassuming equal continuum thresholds for the vector and\naxial-vector channels, sV = sA , the Weinberg sum rules\n(2,3) read as follows:\n\nfV2 m4V \u2212 fA2 m4A = 0 .\n\n(10)\n\nOn the other hand, the operator product expansion\n(OPE) is used to represent the correlator at large spacelike momentum, q 2 = \u2212Q2 < 0:\n\u0012 2\u0013\nc2 c3\nQ\n+c1 + 2 + 4 +* * * ,\n12\u03c0 2 \u03a0(q 2 = \u2212Q2 ) = \u2212c0 Q2 ln\n\u03bc2\nQ Q\n(12)\n\n(6)\n\nThese equations, together with the KSRF relation [7, 8],\nfV2 m2V = 2f\u03c02 ,\n\ntr O exp (\u2212H/T )\n,\ntr exp (\u2212H/T )\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian.\nIn vacuum, the tensor correlation function (9) can be\nrelated to a single invariant correlator, \u03a0(q 2 ) = 31 g\u03bc\u03bd \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd .\nIn a medium, the longitudinal and transverse parts of the\ncorrelator differ as a consequence of broken Lorentz invariance. In the rest frame of the medium and for the case\nin which the mesons have vanishing three-momentum\nq = 0, however, longitudinal and transverse correlation\nfunctions coincide and again are given as a single function \u03a0(\u03c9, q = 0).

In practice, this uncertainty is not prohibitive\nsince the overall correction induced by c2 in Eq. (17)\nis small compared to the dominant term proportional to\ns20 (T ).\nApart from the in-medium modifications of the scalar\ncondensates, new spin-dependent operators appear in the\nOPE because of broken Lorentz invariance in the heat\nbath. Such operators are classified by their canonical dimension and twist (\u03c4 = dimension \u2212 spin). The c2 (T ) in\nthe sum rule for the first moment now includes the contribution from the twist-2 operator ST q\u0304\u03b3\u03bc D\u03bd q, where\nthe symbol ST makes the operator symmetric and traceless with respect to its Lorentz indices. The pion matrix\nelement of this operator in Eq. (19) is evaluated using its\nrelation to the quark distribution function in the pion [9].\nIn the actual calculation, this contribution to c2 (T ) is\nabout three times smaller than the leading T -dependent\ncorrection to the quark condensate in Eq. (20).\n\n4.\n\nA.\n\nSpectral functions with zero width\n\nIt is instructive to test the FESR for the vector and\naxial-vector spectral functions with zero width, the limiting situation realized in the large Nc limit of QCD:\nRV (s, T = 0) = 12\u03c0 2 fV2 m2V \u03b4(s \u2212 m2V ) ,\nRA (s, T = 0) = 12\u03c0 2 fA2 m2A \u03b4(s \u2212 m2A ) .\n\n(26)\n\nThe vector and axial-vector couplings, fV /A , are determined by\nfV2 m2V = 2f\u03c02 ,\n\nfA2 m2A \u2243 f\u03c02 +\n\nsA \u2212 sV\n.\n8\u03c0 2\n\n(27)\n\nThe first part is just the KSRF relation; the second one\nis derived by applying the KSRF relation to the first\nWeinberg sum rule in Eq. (6) and adding the correction\ncoming from the difference between sA and sV . Then the\nlowest two moments of the vector sum rule are:\n3\nsV (T ) \u2212 12\u03c0 2 f\u03c02 \u01eb(T ) ,\n2\n(28)\n3\n12\u03c0 2 fV2 m4V [1 \u2212 \u01eb(T )] = s2V (T ) \u2212 c2 (T ) ,\n(29)\n4\n12\u03c0 2 fV2 m2V [1 \u2212 \u01eb(T )] =\n\nwhere the a1 meson contribution has been omitted be\u221a\ncause in the actual calculation, sV is found to be located at sV \u2264 m2A so that the a1 pole does not contribute\nto the integrals of the spectral moments.\nWith this setup, the continuum threshold in the vector\n\u221a\nchannel is evaluated to be sV \u2243 1.1 GeV at T = 0 from\nthe sum rules, using f\u03c0 \u2243 87 MeV in the chiral limit and\n\u221a\nmV = 770 MeV. Note that sV turns out to be perfectly\nclose to the chiral scale, 4\u03c0 f\u03c0 .\np\nThe finite temperature behavior of sV (T ) extracted\nfrom the sum rules to leading order in \u01eb is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe sum rules for the lowest two moments give consistent\nresults at low temperature. However, although the iden\u221a\ntification sV = 4\u03c0f\u03c0 emerges naturally from Eq. (28) at\n\u221a\nT = 0, the temperature dependence of sV evolves more\nslowly than the canonical f\u03c0 (T ) = [1 \u2212 \u01eb(T )/2] f\u03c0 (T = 0)\nfound in chiral perturbation theory [10].\nDefining an average mass m\u0304 by the normalized first\nmoment of the spectral function,\nR\nds sR\nm\u03042 \u2261 R\n,\n(30)\nds R\n\nPHENOMENOLOGY AT LOW T\n\nThe mixing of vector and axial-vector correlation functions at finite temperature is introduced following Ref.\n[15] and translates correspondingly to the spectral functions:\nRV (s, T ) = [1 \u2212 \u01eb(T )] RV (s, 0) + \u01eb(T ) RA (s, 0) ,\nRA (s, T ) = \u01eb(T ) RV (s, 0) + [1 \u2212 \u01eb(T )] RA (s, 0). (24)\nThe mixing parameter \u01eb is given by the thermal pion loop\nintegral\nZ\n2\n1\nd3 p\n\u01eb(T ) = 2\n.\n(25)\n3\nE/T\nf\u03c0\n(2\u03c0) E(e\n\u2212 1)\nIn the chiral limit (m\u03c0 \u2192 0) it reduces to \u01eb = T 2 /(6f\u03c02 ).\nAt the temperature Td where \u01eb \u2243 0.5, the vector and\naxial-vector spectral functions are maximally mixed and\nbecome degenerate, RV (s, T ) = RA (s, T ). The tempera\u221a\nture at which this degeneracy takes place, Td = 3 f\u03c0 \u2243\n151 MeV (with f\u03c0 = 87 MeV in the chiral limit), is not\nfar from the characteristic temperature commonly associated with the chiral crossover transition (Tc = 170\u2212190\nMeV) [1, 2]. Of course, as one approaches this temperature range, terms of higher order in T 2 become important\nand need to be taken into account.\nIt was pointed out in Ref. [15] that the vector meson\nmass changes weakly at low temperature (i.e., at order\nT 2 ). We demonstrate this feature next by performing the\nFESRs introduced in the previous sections.\n\nwe confirm that the \u03c1 meson mass remains unchanged\nfor T 6= 0 and stays at the vacuum pole position, m\u0304V =\n770 MeV, to leading order in \u01eb. This is consistent with\nthe statement [15, 16] that the vector meson pole position\nremains unchanged at order T 2 .\nIn contrast to the \u03c1 meson case in which the a1 pole\ndoes not contribute to the integrals of the spectral moments (since sV \u2264 m2A ), the left-hand side of the sum\nrules in the axial-vector channel receives contributions\nfrom both \u03c1 and a1 poles.

It is important to\nrealize that sA , as it results from the consistency conditions of the sum-rule analysis, is different from (i.e.,\nsignificantly larger than) sV . In fact, the a1 mass itself is\ncomparable to 4\u03c0f\u03c0 so that the continuum threshold in\nthe axial-vector channel must necessarily be located at a\nhigher scale than sV once the large a1 width is taken into\naccount. Assuming sA = sV \u2261 s0 as in the schematic\nWeinberg sum rules (6), one finds that the leading order temperature dependence, 1 \u2212 2\u01eb, just drops out in\nEq.

The errors include uncertainties in the value of \u03b1s (entering the NLO perturbative\nQCD corrections) and of the gluon condensate.\n\naverage vector mass tends to slightly move upward with\ntemperature, picking up weight from the mixing with the\n\u221a\na1 , while sV moves downward. When using the tightly\nconstrained vacuum spectral functions as input at T = 0,\nit turns out that there can be a small (<5%) mismatch\nbetween the left-hand and the right-hand sides of the\n\u221a\nsum rules. The error assignments in the values of sV\nfrom the sum rule for the first spectral moment take this\nsmall uncertainty into account in Table I.

At\n\u221a\ntemperatures T > 140 MeV, however, solutions for sV\ncease to exist, and hence the average mass at that high\nT cannot be determined via Eq. (32). This is partly a\nconsequence of the restrictions imposed by the treatment\nto leading order in \u01eb(T ). Even more so, it is related to\nthe fact that, with realistic spectral functions, the broad\na1 distribution does not permit a separation of scales between low- and high-energy parts of the spectrum. The\nincreased mixing of the a1 into the \u03c1 spectrum at high\ntemperature enhances this effect. Thus, with realistic\nspectral distributions, the FESR approach has its applicability limited to the range well below the \"melting\"\ntemperature of the resonances.\n\nT 4 corrections\n\nEffects at order T 4 have been treated systematically in\nRef. [16]. It is shown there that these corrections amount\nto replacing the mixing parameter \u01eb by \u01eb \u2192 \u01eb(1 \u2212 \u01eb/2).\nThe temperature Td at which the \u03c1 and a1 spectral distributions\n\u221a become degenerate is now shifted upward to\nTd = 6f\u03c0 .\nThe T 4 correction incorporates interacting pions with\nnonvanishing momentum in the heat bath, which contribute to the Lorentz noninvariant part of the current\ncorrelation function. According to the Ref. [16], this contribution can be expressed in the frame with q = 0 as\nfollows:\n\u03a0V (q 2 = \u2212Q2 , T ) = \u03a0V (\u2212Q2 , T = 0)\n\u0010\n\u0003\n\u01eb\u0011\u0002\n\u2212 \u01eb 1\u2212\n\u03a0V (\u2212Q2 , T = 0) \u2212 \u03a0A (\u2212Q2 , T = 0)\n2\n4\u03c0 2 M2 4\nT ,\n+\n15 Q2\n(35)\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the difference between vector and axial-vector correlators serves as an order parameter of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking\nand restoration.

In this section, we illustrate how the sum rule works for the example of a chiral\neffective field theory in which the vector meson spectral\ndistribution can be explicitly calculated and tested with\nrespect to its sum-rule consistency. The example chosen\nis the chiral Lagrangian based on generalized hidden local symmetry (GHLS) [22], which explicitly includes the\naxial-vector meson in addition to pion and vector meson. Details of the formalism at one loop are found in\nRef. [23].\nThe parity mixing in the \u03c1 meson spectrum at finite\ntemprature is generated from a process in which \u03c0 and a1\nmesons circulate in a loop attached to the \u03c1 meson, with\nthe pion coming from the heat bath. In this approach\none does not have to rely on equations such as Eqs. (24)\nor (35).\n\nwith valence and sea quark distributions, v(x) and s(x),\nrespectively. We use the value M2 \u2243 0.12 as discussed in\n[16].\nBy transferring Eq. (35) to the FESR, it turns out\nthat Eq. (17) is modified by the new term of order T 4 as\nfollows:\nZ sV (T )\n16\u03c0 4 M2 4 c0 2\nT = sV (T ) \u2212 c2 (T ) ,\nds s RV (s, T ) \u2212\n5\n2\n0\n(37)\nwhile the denominator of Eq.

The primary\ntemperature dependence of the spectral function comes\nfrom \u03c1-a1 mixing in the thermal pionic medium. The a1\nmass, again identified with the normalized first moment\nof the axial-vector spectral distribution, decreases with\nrising temperature. This indicates the expected tendency\nof the \u03c1 and a1 spectra becoming identical (degenerate)\nwhen chiral symmetry is restored.

The sum\nrules for the lowest two spectral moments of vector and\naxial-vector spectral functions involve only the leading\nQCD condensates as corrections. With inclusion of perturbative QCD terms up to order \u03b13s , these sum rules\npermit a reliable quantitative analysis, unaffected by the\nlarge uncertainties from condensates of higher dimension\nsuch as the four-quark condensates.\nThe leading temperature corrections involve thermal\npion loops. To order T 2 , the temperature dependence is\ngenerated entirely by the \u03c1 \u2212 a1 mixing effect caused by\nthe nonvanishing \u03c1 \u03c0 a1 coupling in the presence of a pionic heat bath, as pointed out previously by Dey, Eletsky,\nand Ioffe [15]. To this order, there is no shift of the pole\nmass in the thermal vector meson propagator. Next-toleading effects of order T 4 involve \u03c0\u03c0 intermediate states\nand can lead to moderate mass shifts.\nIn the large-Nc limit the \u03c1 and a1 widths vanish. In this\nlimit, schematic distributions with \u03b4 function resonances\nand a step-function parametrization of the high-energy\ncontinuum, when inserted in the FESR analysis, reproduce the well-known current algebra and chiral sum rules.\nAs an interesting feature, one finds that at zero temperature the continuum threshold sV in the vector channel is\nidentified with the scale characteristic of spontaneous chi\u221a\nral symmetry breaking: sV = 4\u03c0 f\u03c0 . Above this scale,\nchiral symmetry is restored in its Wigner-Weyl realization. In the resonance region below this scale, the symmetry is in the spontaneously broken Nambu-Goldstone\nrealization.\nWhen realistic spectral functions with large widths are\nimplemented, this \"clean\" separation of scales is no longer\nrigorously maintained, but the FESR analysis is still useful, with the pole mass in the vector correlator now replaced by the normalized first moment of the spectral\ndistribution.

Such a\ntest can be performed by replacing the step function with\na ramp function to yield a smooth transition between\nresonance and continuum regions, as follows:\nR(s) = Rres (s) \u0398(s2 \u2212 s) + Rc (s) W (s) ,\nwhere the weight function, W (s),\n\uf8f1\n0\nfor\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nx \u2212 s1\nW (x) =\nfor\n\uf8f4\ns2 \u2212 s1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1\nfor\n\n(A1)\n\nis defined as\nx \u2264 s1\ns1 \u2264 x \u2264 s2\n\n(A2)\n\nx \u2265 s2 .\n\nThe step function behavior is recovered for W (x) in the\nlimit s1 \u2192 s2 .\n\n8\n\n\f1.155\n\nT=100 MeV\n\nsV @GeVD\n\n1.150\n\nZ\n\n1.145\n1.140\n1.135\n\ns2\n0\n\ns2\nds sRres (s) = 2\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nc0 + \u03b5 1 \u2212 c2\n2\n(A4)\nZ s2\nds sW (s) .\n\u2212 [c0 \u2212 Rres (s2 )]\ns1\n\n1.130\n\nSets of intervals [s1 , s2 ] are then determined so as to satisfy both sum rules (A3, A4), and the scale sV , defined\nby\n\n1.125\n1.120\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nSlope of W HsL @GeV-2 D\n\u221a\nFIG. 6: Dependence of sV [determined from Eqs.

In this test the uncertainties of \u03b1s (Q2 ) and of the\ngluon condensate have been disregarded for simplicity.\n\nBy using the function W (s), the modified sum rules for\nthe lowest two moments of the spectrum R(s) become\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ s2\n3\nds Rres (s) = s2 c0 + \u03b50 + c1 \u2212 12\u03c0 2 \u03a0(0)\n2\n0\nZ s2\n(A3)\nds W (s) ,\n\u2212 [c0 \u2212 Rres (s2 )]\ns1\n\n(1992).\n[14] B.
