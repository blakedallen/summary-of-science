The model is a discrete Hamiltonian with\ntwo coupling constants and a non-perturbative renormalization group that involves changes in only one of these couplings and is soluble analytically. The\nHamiltonian is the discrete analog to a continuum Hamiltonian previously\nproposed by us.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1971, one of us suggested that renormalization group equations could have limit cycle\nsolutions as well as fixed points when the renormalization group equations involve two\nor more coupling constants [1]. The 1971 paper did not mention the possibility that\nrenormalization group equations might have limit cycle solutions even for differential\nequations for only one coupling constant. But in 1993, the two of us defined a simple\nHamiltonian that requires the renormalization of just a single bare coupling constant g\u039b ,\nwhere \u039b is the cutoff [2]. The bare coupling constant, we demonstrated, exhibits limit\n1\n\nWork supported in part by KBN Grant No. 2 P03B 016 18.\n\n1\n\n\fcycle behavior in the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e. To be precise the coupling constant g\u039b was found\nto decrease steadily as \u039b increased, until g\u039b reached \u2212\u221e, after which it jumped to +\u221e\nand started its next cycle of steady decrease. However, we did not recognize or comment\nthat this behavior constituted a limit cycle. Moreover, the Hamiltonian we defined is\nsingular, in such a way that it presumably does not have well-defined s-wave scattering\nphase shifts. The model has well-defined bound states, and our renormalization group\nanalysis was based on keeping the finite bound state energies fixed as \u039b \u2192 \u221e.\nThe model Hamiltonian we published in 1993 has no known physical application.\nBut in 1999, Bedaque, Hammer, and Van Kolck showed that a three-body Hamiltonian\nwith two- and three-body delta function potentials and a cutoff in momentum space is\nrenormalizable and that the three-body coupling approaches a limit cycle as the cutoff\nlambda approaches \u221e [3], much as it does in our 1993 model. Bedaque et al built on\nearlier work of Thomas [4] and Efimov [5], that was recently reviewed by Nielsen, Fedorov,\nJensen, and Garrido [6]. However, the mathematics of the three body system is complex,\nand it is surely useful to have simpler models to study that exhibit limit cycles too.\nIn this paper, we discuss a discretized version of the Hamiltonian we introduced in\n1993. With a cutoff, the discretized model takes the form of a finite size matrix with\ndiscrete eigenvalues. The discrete matrix has a diagonal sub-matrix, plus two off-diagonal\npieces with two coupling constants. The Hamiltonian requires renormalization in the limit\nof infinite cutoff. Just as in the continuum case, the renormalization can be constructed\nanalytically and leads to a limit cycle in one of the two couplings, while the second\ncoupling constant stays fixed. But the analytically obtained limit cycle is defined only\nfor a discrete sequence of cutoffs, rather than for a continuously varying cutoff. Using\nnumerical procedures, it is possible to define and compute a renormalization process with\na continuously varying cutoff, but our studies with the continuous cutoff variation will\nnot be discussed here.\nThe finite matrix Hamiltonians can be diagonalized numerically, when the cutoff is\nsmall enough. The renormalizability of the Hamiltonians we will discuss here can be\ndemonstrated to high numerical accuracy with cutoffs small enough to allow numerical\ndiagonalization. We will provide the demonstration with a comparison of the eigenvalues\nof two matrices with two different cutoffs, one of size 37x37, the other of size 42x42.\nThe Hamiltonian to be used in this paper has the form\nHmn (gN , hN ) = (Em En )1/2 [\u03b4mn \u2212 gN \u2212 ihN smn ] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m and n are integers. For m = n, \u03b4mn = 1 and smn = 0. For m 6= n, \u03b4mn = 0 and\nsmn = (m \u2212 n)/|m \u2212 n|. The numbers En = bn with b > 1, are eigenvalues of the operator\nH0 that has matrix elements hm|H0 |ni = Hmn (0, 0). The eigenvalues are called kinetic\nenergies of the corresponding eigenstates, |ni. The remaining part of the Hamiltonian,\nHI = H \u2212 H0 , is called an interaction, and HI (0, 0) = 0. The largest energy allowed\nin the dynamics is \u039bN = bN , which defines the ultraviolet cutoff so that the subscripts\nm, n \u2264 N.\nThe continuous version of this model [2] is recovered in the limit b \u2192 1. The discrete\nmodel itself has been discussed in the case hN = 0 using similarity renormalization group\nidea [7] and Wegner's equation [8]. It was shown that the model exhibits asymptotic\nfreedom for hN = 0. Hamiltonians of Eq. (1) with hN = 0 can be derived in a number of\n2\n\n\fways, ranging from a discretization of a nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle\non a plane with a two-dimensional \u03b4-potential, to a discrete version of the transverse\ndynamics of partons in quantum field theory.\nAt first, the model with hN 6= 0 does not appear much different from the one with\nhN = 0. All Hamiltonians defined by Eq. (1) are hermitian and have a general ultraviolet logarithmically divergent structure. The divergence originates in the fact that\nthe far off-energy-shell matrix elements of Hmn , i.e. those with |m \u2212 n| \u226b 1, behave\nlike (Em En )1/2 . Therefore, perturbation theory produces large-energy contributions of\nP\nthe form i (Em Ei )1/2 (1/Ei ) (Ei En )1/2 , and every energy scale contributes a significant\namount to the sum, which grows linearly with the number of initially included scales,\nN = ln \u039bN / ln b. The dependence of the unrenormalized coupling constants gN and hN\non N, is expected to compensate this effect. As we will demonstrate below, when hN is\nnot zero, the model exhibits limit cycle behavior as N goes to infinity. We will prove this\nby deriving a renormalization group equation that determines gN \u22121 (used with a cutoff\n\u039bN \u22121 ), given gN and hN used with cutoff \u039bN , such that the low energy eigenvalues stay\nfixed.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the discrete RG flow of the\nmodel Hamiltonians H(gN , hN ) with N. The structure of eigenstates of these Hamiltonians is also briefly described. Section 3 shows a numerical example of the spectrum of\nrenormalized Hamiltonians and their discrete rescaling properties. The spectrum is found\nto contain a sequence of negative (bound state) eigenvalues, one per cycle. Section 4\nconcludes the paper.\n\n2\n\nRenormalization group trajectories\n\nThe eigenvalue problem\nN\nX\n\nHmn \u03c8n = E\u03c8m ,\n\n(2)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\ncan be solved for \u03c8m , m \u2264 N, assuming that one knows E, by using the Gaussian elimination procedure. In the first step one can express \u03c8N in terms of all other components,\n\u03c8n with n < N. In the next step, one expresses \u03c8N \u22121 in terms of components \u03c8n with\nn < N \u2212 1, and so on. In fact, this procedure can be carried out without knowing E if\nthe eliminated energy scales are much larger than E. Thus, when one is interested in the\neigenvalues of order bM with M \u2192 \u2212\u221e, one can eliminate states from some huge energy\nrange between \u039bN = bN and some fixed \u039b0 = bN0 , where N0 is much smaller than N and\nstill \u039b0 \u226b E. The new, much smaller eigenvalue problem will have the cutoff \u039b0 and\nthe corresponding coupling constants. When the recursion for the whole sequence of the\ncoupling constants (gN , hN ), (gN \u22121 , hN \u22121 ),..., (gN0 , hN0 ), is found, one can trace it back\nstarting from some assumed finite values (g0 , h0 ) at a finite N0 and see what happens with\n(gN , hN ) when the cutoff number N \u2192 \u221e.\nTo carry out the above procedure, it is convenient to introduce a small number \u1ebc =\nE/bN and write the eigenstate components in the form \u03c8n = bn/2 \u03c6n for all n \u2264 N. The\neigenvalue Eq. (2) becomes:\n\n3\n\n\f(1 \u2212 \u1ebc)\u03c6N = gN \u03c3N\n(1 \u2212 b\u1ebc)\u03c6N \u22121 = gN \u03c3N\n(1 \u2212 b2 \u1ebc)\u03c6N \u22122 = gN \u03c3N\n:\nn\n(1 \u2212 b \u1ebc)\u03c6N \u2212n = gN \u03c3N\n:\n,\n\n+ ihN \u03c3N \u22121 ,\n+ ihN (\u2212\u03c6N + \u03c3N \u22122 ) ,\n+ ihN (\u2212\u03c6N \u2212 \u03c6N \u22121 + \u03c3N \u22123 ) ,\n+ ihN (\u2212\u03c6N + ... \u2212 \u03c6N \u2212n+1 + \u03c3N \u2212n\u22121 ) ,\n\nwhere \u03c3i = ij=\u2212\u221e \u03c6j . If E and n are finite and N \u2192 \u221e, bi \u1ebc for i = 0, 1, ..., n on the left\nhand sides of the above equations do not count. The first step of the Gaussian procedure\ngives\n\u03c6N = (gN + ihN )\u03c3N \u22121 /(1 \u2212 gN ) .\n(3)\nP\n\nSubstituting this result into the remaining equations, one obtains a new set that does not\nexplicitly involve the component with largest kinetic energy but has a different coupling\nconstant instead. Namely,\n(1 \u2212 b\u1ebc)\u03c6N \u22121 = gN \u22121 \u03c3N \u22121 + ihN \u22121 \u03c3N \u22122 ,\n(1 \u2212 b2 \u1ebc)\u03c6N \u22122 = gN \u22121 \u03c3N \u22121 + ihN \u22121 (\u2212\u03c6N \u22121 + \u03c3N \u22123 ) ,\n:\nn\n(1 \u2212 b \u1ebc)\u03c6N \u2212n = gN \u22121 \u03c3N \u22121 + ihN \u22121 (\u2212\u03c6N \u22121 + ... \u2212 \u03c6N \u2212n+1 + \u03c3N \u2212n\u22121 ) ,\n:\n.\n2\nThe new coupling constant gN \u22121 = gN + (gN\n+ h2N )/(1 \u2212 gN ), while hN \u22121 = hN stays\nunchanged. Making p such steps, one transforms (gN , hN ) into (gN \u2212p , hN \u2212p ), where\nhN \u2212p = hN and\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\ngN\ngN \u2212p = hN tan arctan\n+ p arctan(hN ) .\n(4)\nhN\n\nIt is visible that gN \u2212p = gN when hN = tan(\u03c0/p). Equation (4) demonstrates that the\ncoupling constant gN completes a cycle when \u039bN is reduced to \u039bN /bp , and the cycle repeats\nitself in the further reductions. Fig. 1 shows these cycles for \u039b16 = b16 , g = 0.060606 [8],\nand h16 = tan(\u03c0/5). If g16 were zero, the cycle would be symmetric with respect to the\naxis gN = 0. On the other hand, components of the eigenvectors of H(gN , hN ) satisfy the\nrecursion\n1 \u2212 ihN \u2212 E/bn+1\n\u03c8n = b1/2\n\u03c8n+1 ,\n(5)\n1 + ihN \u2212 E/bn\nfor all N and n \u2264 N independently of the value of gN .\nNote that for real Hamiltonian matrices, i.e. for hN \u2192 0, Eq.

In contrast, for complex Hamiltonians, Eq.

The corresponding coupling constant h = tan(\u03c0/p) becomes then equal to\n\u03c0/p = (\u03c0 ln b)/ ln rc and the constant c in Eq. (7) becomes equal to \u03c0/ ln rc . This result\nshows that the limit b \u2192 1 in the discrete model reproduces the continuum case from\nRef. [2], and the period ratio is rc = exp(\u03c0/c) for all values of the imaginary part c of\nthe interaction term. The fixed-point behavior with asymptotic freedom is obtained only\nin the limit c \u2192 0, as the RG behavior in a one long cycle.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nNumerical example\n\nFor illustration of the limit cycle from Fig. 1 and to show the existence of bound state\nsolutions associated with it, Table 1 provides results of diagonalization of two Hamiltonian\nmatrices: H1 with m and n ranging from M = \u221225 to N = 16, and H2 with N = 11 and\nthe same M. Both Hamiltonians have the same values of b = 2, h16 = h11 = tan(\u03c0/5) \u223c\n0.726543, and g16 = g11 = 0.060606 [8]. The Hamiltonian H2 is considered a result of five\ndiscrete RG steps applied to the Hamiltonian H1 . The infrared cutoff M was introduced\nin order to use a computer for calculations. The lower is M the better is the agreement\nbetween the example and the cycle theory applicable for M \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The eigenvalues\nof small modulus (not too small, however, to stay away from the lower bound bM ) are\nidentical in both cases within the displayed numerical accuracy. For these eigenvalues,\nthe RG analysis of the previous section is fully confirmed. For eigenvalues close to the\nartificial lower bound bM , the finite size of the matrix changes the pattern in a certain\nway, which is not relevant here.\nThe scaling phenomenon of interest is described by showing the ratios of ratios of\nsuccessive eigenvalues for one matrix to two characteristic numbers. The negative eigenvalues, that correspond to bound states (En = bn are positive for all values of n), appear\nin a geometric sequence with quotient 32, with accuracy approaching several ppm in the\nbest cases. Thus, there is one bound state per cycle among the solutions. The positive\neigenvalues also appear in a geometric sequence, but with a quotient almost equal 25/4 ,\nwhich can be understood on the basis of dimensional analysis without inspecting details\nof the solution. Namely, after p reduction steps one eliminates p states from the dynamics\nand obtains the Hamiltonian H2 that is equivalent to b\u2212p H1 = H1 /32. Since in every\ncycle among the p states only p \u2212 1 have positive eigenvalues and the cycle repeats itself\nindefinitely, the ratio of the successive p\u22121 eigenvalues (if such a common quotient exists)\nmust satisfy the condition r p\u22121 = bp in order to scale properly from one cycle to another.\nTherefore, r = bp/(p\u22121) , and in the example one obtains the factor 321/4 . Deviations from\nthat rule within a single cycle cannot be understood so simply but the calculation shows\na repeating sequence within a cycle with all elements very close to r.\nHowever, the most prominent feature of the example is the appearance of one negative\neigenvalue in every cycle. It requires further studies to be fully understood. Here it is\nnoted that when the period p tends to infinity with hN \u2192 0, one recovers the case\nfrom Ref. [8], with asymptotic freedom and a bound state, but in infinitely many copies\nconnected together in a sequence. In every single long-cycle link in that chain, looked at\nin the direction of growing \u039b, the asymptotically free coupling decreases logarithmically\ntowards large energies until it eventually crosses zero, grows in size and turns up rapidly.\nA new generation bound state is uncovered at that scale, and a new cycle starts from a\nlarge coupling constant that decreases slowly again.\n\n6\n\n\fn\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n-9\n-10\n-11\n-12\n-13\n-14\n-15\n-16\n-17\n-18\n-19\n-22\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n\u039b = 216\n0.954734+05\n0.328953+05\n0.131845+05\n0.545303+04\n0.228087+04\n0.956198+03\n0.401063+03\n0.168593+03\n0.709615+02\n0.298253+02\n0.125234+02\n0.526682+01\n0.221724+01\n0.931986+00\n0.391347+00\n0.164586+00\n0.692886-01\n0.291245-01\n0.122296-01\n0.514332-02\n0.216526-02\n0.910135-03\n0.382169-03\n0.160723-03\n0.676587-04\n0.284359-04\n0.119370-04\n0.501683-05\n0.210854-05\n0.882705-06\n0.367003-06\n0.150481-06\n0.584264-07\n0.654169-08\n-.622117-06\n-.206506-04\n-.661561-03\n-.211707-01\n-.677466-00\n-.216826+02\n-.697598+03\n-.270871+05\n\nr\n0.819481\n0.953270\n0.983701\n0.994830\n0.997093\n0.997590\n0.999803\n1.001090\n0.999652\n0.998679\n1.000260\n1.001270\n0.999731\n0.998713\n1.000270\n1.001280\n0.999733\n0.998714\n1.000270\n1.001280\n0.999730\n0.998705\n1.000250\n1.001230\n0.999610\n0.998423\n0.999594\n0.999630\n0.995684\n0.988875\n0.975210\n0.923457\n0.266298\n0.964026\n0.998881\n0.999965\n0.999994\n0.999832\n0.994617\n0.824124\n-\n\n\u039b = 211\n0.298354+04\n0.102798+04\n0.412015+03\n0.170407+03\n0.712770+02\n0.298812+02\n0.125332+02\n0.526853+01\n0.221755+01\n0.932040+00\n0.391357+00\n0.164588+00\n0.692889-01\n0.291245-01\n0.122296-01\n0.514332-02\n0.216526-02\n0.910135-03\n0.382169-03\n0.160723-03\n0.676587-04\n0.284359-04\n0.119370-04\n0.501683-05\n0.210854-05\n0.882705-06\n0.367003-06\n0.150481-06\n0.584264-07\n0.654169-08\n-.622117-06\n-.206506-04\n-.661561-03\n-.211708-01\n-.677580+00\n-.217999+02\n-.846472+03\n-\n\nr\n0.819481\n0.953270\n0.983701\n0.994830\n0.997093\n0.997590\n0.999803\n1.001090\n0.999652\n0.998679\n1.000260\n1.001270\n0.999731\n0.998713\n1.000270\n1.001280\n0.999730\n0.998705\n1.000250\n1.001230\n0.999610\n0.998423\n0.999594\n0.999630\n0.995684\n0.988875\n0.975210\n0.923457\n0.266298\n0.964026\n0.998880\n0.999960\n0.999831\n0.994617\n0.824124\n-\n\nTable 1.

But the central result of our paper is that such a simple\nHamiltonian exhibits limit cycle behavior for non-zero h instead of a fixed point. Together\nwith the limit cycle found by Bedaque et al, and implicit in earlier work of Efimov and\nThomas, this raises the question of whether limit cycle behavior is a common feature\nof renormalized quantum theories, outside of those that have already been solved and\nare known to exhibit fixed points. The model analysis carried out here certainly needs\nimprovements, especially concerning details of the bound state formation and the sharp\nturn of the coupling where it approaches 1 and Eq. (4) produces a jump.\nSeparately from the existence of the limit cycle, the model is also valuable because it\ncan be studied using the similarity RG technique (see [8]), and the latter can be applied to\nHamiltonians in quantum field theories of major interest, such as QCD (see e.g. [9, 10]).\n(We do not expect QCD in particular to show limit cycle behavior: our comments about\nlimit cycles apply more to broad classes of Hamiltonians, most not yet examined, rather\nthan specific ones already examined as extensively as QCD has been.) The authors have\ngenerated numerical solutions to Wegner's differential equation in the model and found\ncontinuous similarity RG evolution of effective couplings with all key features described\nhere. Thus, when one uses the similarity scheme in studies of effective Hamiltonians in\nmore advanced models, one may also encounter complex RG scenarios. It remains to be\nseen if the model structure reappears in realistic quantum theories.\n\nReferences\n[1] K. G. Wilson, Phys. Rev. D3, 1818 (1971).\n[2] St. D. Glazek and K. G. Wilson, Phys. Rev.
