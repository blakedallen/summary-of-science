They\nall correspond to covalently bonded hydrocarbons with a C:H\nratio of 1. Interesting enough, four isomers have been found\nto be more stable than benzene, indeed an intriguing issue. By\nhydrogenation, a set of two dimensional materials is generated\nwith new physico-chemical properties: for instance, graphane\nis an insulator2,3 , with an energy gap as large as \u223c 6 eV6 ,\nwhile graphene is a highly conductive semi-metal. Furthermore, disordered hydrogenated samples show electronic and\nphonon properties quite different than the pristine material4 .\nAs far as the elastic behavior is concerned, it has been\nproved that hydrogenation largely affects the elastic moduli\nas well. By blending together continuum elasticity theory\nand first principles calculations, Cadelano et al.7 have determined the linear and non linear elastic moduli of three stable graphane isomers, namely : chair- (C-), boat- (B-), and\nwashboard- (W-) graphane. The resulting picture is very interesting: B-graphene is found to have a small and negative\nPoisson ratio, while, due to the lack of isotropy, C-graphane\nadmits both softening and hardening non linear hyperelasticity, depending on the direction of applied load.\nAlthough full hydrogen coverage is possible both in ordered\nand disordered configurations,5 it is more likely that a typical\nexperimental processing procedure generates samples with a\nC:H ratio larger than 1. In other words, we must admit that\ngraphane could exist not only in a large variety of conformers, included the amorphous one (hereafter referred to as Agraphane), but also in several forms characterized by different\nstoichiometry.\nIn this work we investigate the variation of the Young modulus of graphane versus the hydrogen coverage, in three stable\nconformers7 and in the amorphous one. The work is addressed\nto establish whether an incomplete sp3 hybridization affects\nthe elastic behavior and which is the trend (if any) of variation of the Young modulus versus hybridization, an issue of\nlarge technological impact. Our approach combines continuum elasticity (used to define the deformation protocol aimed\nat determining the elastic energy density of the investigated\nsystems) and first principles atomistic calculations (used to\nactually calculate such an energy density and the corresponding elastic moduli).\nAtomistic calculations have been performed by Density\n\nFunctional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Q UAN TUM ESPRESSO package8. The exchange correlation potential was evaluated through the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)\nparameterization9, using Rabe-Rappe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos\n(RRKJ) ultrasoft pseudopotentials10,11 . A plane wave basis\nset with kinetic energy cutoff as high as 24 Ry was used\nand the Brillouin zone (BZ) has been sampled by means of\na (4x4x1) Monkhorst-Pack grid. The atomic positions of the\ninvestigated samples have been optimized by using damped\ndynamics and periodically-repeated simulation cells. Accordingly, the interactions between adjacent atomic sheets in the\nsupercell geometry were hindered by a large spacing greater\nthan 10 \u00c5.\nThe Young modulus of the structures under consideration\nhas been obtained from energy-vs-strain curves, corresponding to suitable deformations applied to samples with different\nhydrogen coverage, namely: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The\ncorresponding simulation cell contained 8 carbon atoms and\n2, 4, 6, and 8 hydrogen atoms, respectively. For any possible\ncoverage (other than the 100% one), several different geometries (up to 10) have been considered, by randomly distributing hydrogen atoms according to different decoration motifs.\nThis implies that all data below are obtained through configurational averages, a technical issue standing for the robustness\nof the present results.\nFor any deformation the magnitude of the strain is represented by a single parameter \u03b6 .7 Thus, the energy-vs-strain\ncurves have been carefully generated by varying the magnitude of \u03b6 in steps of 0.001 up to a maximum strain \u03b6max =\n\u00b10.02. This choice warrants that the linear elastic regime\nwas carefully explored. All results have been confirmed by\nchecking the stability of the estimated elastic moduli over\nseveral fitting ranges for each sample. The reliability of the\npresent computational set up is proved by the estimated values for the Young modulus (E) and the Poisson ratio (\u03bd ) of\npristine graphene (corresponding to 0% of hydrogen coverage), respectively 349 Nm\u22121 and 0.15, which are in excellent\nagreement with recent literature.7,12\u201315 Similarly, our results\nE = 219 Nm\u22121 and \u03bd = 0.21 for stoichiometric C-graphane\n(corresponding to 100% hydrogen coverage) agree with data\nreported in Ref. 7, 16, and 17.\nAmong the systems here investigated, stoichiometric Cgraphane is elastically isotropic due to its crystallographic\n\n\f2\nsymmetry, while its non stoichiometric conformers with 25%,\n50% and 75% hydrogen coverage (see Fig. 1) are so by\nassumption (which is indeed reasonable by only assuming\nthat the hydrogen decoration in real samples is totally random). Similar properties hold for A-graphane. On the other\nhand, stoichiometric B- and W-graphane show an orthorhombic symmetry, which causes an anisotropic linear elastic behavior. Their non stoichiometric conformers could became\nisotropic due to the achieved disorder degree, as discussed below.\nThe two-dimensional elastic energy density (per unit of\narea) for systems with orthorhombic symmetry (namely, Band W-graphane) is expressed as18,19\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\nU = C11 \u03b5xx\n+ C22 \u03b5yy\n+ C12 \u03b5xx \u03b5yy + 2C44\u03b5xy\n(1)\n2\n2\nwhere x (y) indicates the zigzag (armchair) direction in the\nhoneycomb carbon lattice and \u03b5i j (i, j = x or y) is the infinitesimal strain tensor. By applying a loading at an angle \u03b8 with\nrespect to the zigzag direction, the corresponding Young modulus E(\u03b8 ) is written as7\nE(\u03b8 ) =\n\n2\nC11 C22 \u2212 C12\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\nC\nC\n\u2212C\nC11 s4 + C22 c4 + 11 C2244 12 \u2212 2C12 c2 s2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere c = cos \u03b8 , and s = sin \u03b8 . Eqs.(1) and (2) are also valid\nfor isotropy systems (namely, C- and A-graphane) provided\nthat it is set: C11 = C22 and 2C44 = C11 \u2212 C12 (Cauchy relation).\nThe Young modulus E(\u03b8 ) can be directly obtained from\nthe linear elastic constants Ci j , in turn computed through\nenergy-vs-strain curves corresponding to suitable homogeneous in-plane deformations. Only two in-plane deformations\nmust be applied to obtain all the independent elastic constants, namely: (i) an uniaxial deformation along the zigzag\n(or armchair) direction; and (ii) an hydrostatic planar deformation. Nevertheless, for the validation of the isotropicity\ncondition, two more in-plane deformations must be further\napplied: (iii) an axial deformation along the armchair (or\nzigzag) direction; and (iv) a shear deformation. The strain\ntensors corresponding to applied deformations depend on the\nunique scalar strain parameter \u03b6 7,15 , so that the elastic energy of strained structures defined in Eq.(1) can be written as\nU(\u03b6 ) = U0 + 12 U (2) \u03b6 2 + O(\u03b6 3 ), where U0 is the energy of the\nunstrained configuration. Since the expansion coefficient U (2)\nis related to the elastic constants Ci j , a straightforward fit provides the full set of linear moduli for all structures. Repeating\nthis procedure for several randomly distributed hydrogens in\ndifferent configurational symmetries (corresponding to C-, B-,\nW-, and A-graphane), the complete set of elastic constants Ci j\nhas been evaluated (as an average value) at various coverages.\nThe synopsis of the calculated elastic constants Ci j for all\ngraphane samples here investigated is reported in Table I, from\nwhich quite a few information can be extracted. As a preliminary remark, we stress that each hydrogenated conformer\nis characterized by a specific hydrogen arrangement and by\na different buckling of the carbon sublattice. Moreover, in\nnon stoichiometric samples hydrogen atoms can migrate (as\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1.

These features add further details to an\nalready complex situation, introducing another source of disorder. We, therefore, argue that the amorphous configuration\nshould be considered the most probable phase. Alternatively,\nthe above mentioned migration of hydrogen atoms could indeed generate phase separation into C-H and pure C domains,\nas discussed by Lin et al.20 .\nBy inserting the values reported in Table I into the Eq.(2),\nwe obtain the Young modulus E(\u03b8 ) for any hydrogen coverage, as shown in Fig.2. As a general feature, we state that\nthe change in hybridization has largely reduced the property\nof longitudinal resistance upon extension, as described by the\ngreatly reduced value of the Young modulus with respect to\nideal graphene (bold dashed line in Fig. 2).

In such a polar plot, an isotropic behavior corresponds to a circular line. This is always found for C- and\nA-graphane (as well as for ideal graphene), as expected. On\nthe other hand, above 75% hydrogen coverage, the B- and Wconformers show a strong \u03b8 -dependence in their elastic behavior (or, equivalently, of their Young modulus). Interesting\nenough, well below this coverage they almost behave isotropically.\nDeviations from the isotropic elastic behavior are quantitatively predicted by the calculation of the A = 4C44 /(C11 +\nC22 \u2212 2C12 ) ratio, which should be 1 for ideally isotropic\nsystems.

On the other hand, non stoichiometric Band W-samples with hydrogen coverage smaller than 75%\ndisplay a comparatively small anisotropy, corresponding to\nA = 1.0 \u00b1 0.2. Finally, these same systems with higher\nhydrogen coverage recover a full anisotropic behavior (A is\nlargely different than 1).\nIn conclusion, we have presented and discussed first principles calculations showing that the elastic behavior of graphene\nis largely affected by hydrogen absorption by the actual coverage. In particular, the Young modulus is greatly reduced upon\nhydrogenation, as also previously discussed in Ref. 17. An\nincomplete coverage generates a large configurational disorder in the hydrogen sublattice, leading to a larger corrugation\nwith respect to highly-symmetric C-graphane. Indeed, such a\ncorrugation of the carbon sublattice is a key feature affecting\nthe overall elastic behavior.\nWe acknowledge financial support by Regional Government of Sardinia under the project \"Ricerca di Base\" titled \"Modellizzazione Multiscala della Meccanica dei Materiali Complessi\" (RAS-M4C).
