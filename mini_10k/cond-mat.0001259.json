INTRODUCTION\n\nA central issue in the thermal properties of heavy-fermion compounds is the discovery\nof a non-Fermi liquid behavior in systems close to an antiferromagnetic quantum phase\ntransition [1]. Such a behavior has been discovered in a series of compounds containing\ncerium or uranium, for example, CeCu6\u2212x Rx (R=Au, Ag) [2], CeIn3 , CeP d2 Si2 [3],\nCeNi2 Ge2 [4], U1\u2212x Yx P d3 [5] and Cex La1\u2212x Ru2 Si2 [6]. In CeCu5.9 Au0.1 , the specific\n\u221a\nheat C depends on T as C/T \u223c \u2212ln(T /T0 ), the magnetic susceptibility as \u03c7 \u223c 1\u2212\u03b1 T ,\nand the T-dependent part of the resistivity as \u2206\u03c1 \u223c T (instead of C/T \u223c \u03c7 \u223c Const\nand \u2206\u03c1 \u223c T 2 in the Fermi liquid state). Most interestingly, the breakdown of the\nFermi liquid behavior can be tuned by alloying (chemical pressure) or by applying a\nhydrostatic pressure or a magnetic field. The origin of this NFL behavior is a problem\nof current debate.\nDifferent scenarios have been proposed in order to elucidate the non-Fermi liquid\n(NFL) behavior at the quantum critical point (QCP). On the one hand, there are scenarios involving strong disorder to account for the non-Fermi liquid properties, including\n(i) a distribution of the Kondo temperature P (TK ) [7] induced by disorder following a\ndistribution of the local density of states, and (ii) the possibility of the formation of a\nGriffiths phase at the quantum critical point [8,9]. On the other hand, starting from a\nclean or rather weakly disordered system, there is a scenario (iii) refering to the proximity of a quantum critical point in a theory of itinerant antiferromagnetism [10\u201317], in\nwhich the Fermi surface is coupled to critical collective antiferromagnetic excitations.\nAn alternative possibility has been recently put forward [18] on the basis of an analysis\nof the neutron scattering measurements in CeCu5.9Au0.1 . The unusual spin dynamics\nthat has been observed suggests (iv) the existence of critically screened local magnetic\nexcitations due to the formation of local moments. Finally, it has been proposed (v) a\nvariant of the quadropular Kondo effect [19] in which the interactions of the rare earth\n(actinide) internal degrees of freedom with the conduction electrons are reduced to a\nsingle impurity multichannel Kondo effect. As it stands, the situation remains highly\ncontroversial.\nIn this paper, we adopt the point of view (iii) of the proximity of a quantum critical\npoint. The effect of a non zero temperature on quantum critical points is a long-standing\nproblem encountered in itinerant magnetism. We refer to the papers of Hertz [20] and\nMillis [11] using renormalization group techniques, and of Moriya [21] introducing a\nself-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory of spin-fluctuations. These theories yield\na rich phase diagram with, in addition to the ordering temperature TN , a series of\ncrossover temperatures separating different regimes of behaviors. They are well adapted\nfor the treatment of spin fluctuations as present in the single-band Hubbard model but\nessentially do not account for the Kondo effect.\nIndeed, the model which is believed to describe the physics of heavy fermions is the\nKondo lattice model (KLM) [22] derived from the periodic Anderson model (PAM) in a\ngiven limit. The large N expansions [23] which have been carried out for these models\n(where N represents simultaneously the degeneracy of the conduction electrons and of\nthe spin channels) give a good description of the Kondo effect. But, unlike the abovementioned spin-fluctuation theories, they fail to account for the spin-fluctuations since\n2\n\n\fthe RKKY interactions only appear at the order 1/N 2 [24].\nHence our motivation to set up an approach of the S = 1/2 Kondo lattice model\n(N = 2) that enlarges the standard 1/N expansion theories up on the spin-fluctuation\neffects. Our previous paper [25], presented such an approach by performing a generalized\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation on the Kondo interaction term of the Hamiltonian\nwhich makes three types of fields (magnetization densities and Kondo-type) appear on\nan equal footing. The dynamical spin susceptibility was derived in a one-loop expansion\nassociated with the gaussian fluctuations of the magnetization density fields around\ntheir saddle-point values.\nWith the aim to describe the critical phenomena around the quantum critical point\nof the heavy-fermion systems, we propose to push the treatment of the S = 1/2 Kondo\nlattice model in a self-consistent one-loop approximation in complete analogy with the\nSCR theory of spin fluctuations developed for the Hubbard model [21,26,27]. As in itinerant magnetism, we will show how the system displays a quantum-classical crossover\nat finite temperature depending whether the temperature is lower or higher than the\ncharacteristic energy-scale of the collective mode associated with the magnetic instability. The low temperature behavior in the different regimes essentially depends on\nthe value of the dynamic exponent z of the mode and on the dimensionality d of the\nproblem. In the case of an antiferromagnetic instability, z is found to be equal to 2.\nHeavy-fermion systems are usually believed to be three-dimensional. However, a recent\nproposal [28] based on the neutron scattering data obtained in CeCu6\u2212x Aux stipulates\nthat the critical magnetic fluctuations which the quasiparticles are coupled to, are simply\ntwo-dimensional. So both situations d = 2 and d = 3 will be considered.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In part II, we introduce the selfconsistent one-loop approximation method for the Kondo lattice model using a generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation on the Kondo interaction term. The\napproach combines both aspects of the 1/N expansion and of the self-consistent renormalization theory of spin fluctuations. The calculations, presented in the functional\nintegral formalism, closely follow the presentation made by Hertz and Klenin [27] for\nthe Hubbard model. In part III, we extract the general expression of the dynamical\nspin susceptibility extending the results of the previous paper [25] to a self-consistent\ntreatment. Part IV gives a discussion on the nature of the damped collective mode associated to the proximity of the magnetic transition with a dynamic exponent z = 2 in the\nantiferromagnetic case. In part V, we derive the resulting quantum-classical crossover.\nThis occurs at a finite temperature T, which depends on how the energy of the mode, on\nthe scale of the magnetic correlation length \u03be compares to kB T . The low temperature\nbehavior of the system in the different regimes, separated by the crossover temperatures,\nis then discussed in part VI. Concluding remarks follow in section VII.\nII.

Details of the solution are given in Appendix A. It gives rise to the\nband structure illustrated in Figure 1 with the formation of a Kondo or Abrikosov-Suhl\nresonance pinned at the Fermi level and split by a hybridization gap defining two bands\n\u03b1 and \u03b2. The saddle-point solution transposes to N=2 the large-N results obtained\nwithin the slave-boson mean-field theories (SBMFT).\nThen we consider the self-consistent one-loop approximation beyond the saddle-point\nsolution in the magnetically-disordered phase \u03bef0 = \u03be c0 = 0. Following Read and Newns\n[29], we take advantage of the local U(1) gauge transformation of the lagrangian L\u2032 (\u03c4 ):\n\u2032\n\u03a6i \u2192 ri exp(i\u03b8i ); fi \u2192 fi\u2032 exp(i\u03b8i ); \u03bbi \u2192 \u03bbi + i \u2202\u03b8i /\u2202\u03c4 . We use the radial gauge in\nwhich the modulus of both fields \u03a6i and \u03a6\u2217i are the radial field ri , and their phase \u03b8i\n(via its time derivative) is incorporated into the Lagrange multiplier \u03bbi which turns out\nto be a field. Use of the radial instead of the cartesian gauge bypasses the familiar\ncomplications of infrared divergences associated with unphysical Goldstone bosons. We\nlet the fields fluctuate away from their saddle-point values : ri = r0 + \u03b4ri , \u03bbi = \u03bb0 + \u03b4\u03bbi ,\n\u03befi = \u03b4\u03be fi and \u03beci = \u03b4\u03be ci .

(7)\n\nAs in the conventional approaches to critical phenomena, we have integrated out the\nfermions and thereby reduced the problem to the study of an effective bosonic theory\ndescribing fluctuations of the ordering fields. But contrary to Hertz [20] and Millis\n[11], who considered a single field corresponding to the magnetization density of one\ntype of electron, our approach, starting from a different microscopic model, extends the\n5\n\n\fdescription to the case of several fields i.e. the Kondo fields (ri , \u03bbi ) on the one hand,\nand the f - and c- magnetization densities on the other.\nWe then propose to solve this field theory in a variational way.

The different buband equivalent expression for the transverse spin part D\n\u03bd\nS\nbles h\u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd )i in the latter expressions represent the susceptibilities \u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd ) (cf. ap(2)\npendix B) averaged over the distribution of fields exp[\u2212\u2206Seef f (r, \u03bb, \u03bef , \u03bec )]. At that\npoint, the problem is highly complex and cannot be solved exactly. Therefore, we introduce a local and instantaneous approximation which is equivalent to averaging over\ngaussian distributions of local fields (ri , \u03bbi , \u03befi , \u03beci ) with variances \u03c3r , \u03c3\u03bb , \u03c3f and \u03c3c\ndefined as\n\n6\n\n\f\u03c3f2 = 3\n\nX\n\nk\n\nq,i\u03c9\u03bd\n\nf (q, i\u03c9 ) ],\n[D\n\u03bd ff\nS\n\n(10)\n\nand similar expressions for the three other variances. Eq.(10) is obtained from Eq.(8) by\nletting the summation over (q, i\u03c9\u03bd ) act on the matrix elements only, hence defining the\nlocal and instantaneous fluctuations of the various degrees of freedom. One expects that\nat low temperatures, the fluctuations of ri , \u03bbi and \u03be ci only bring T 2 corrections to their\nsaddle-point values. Those corrections are negligible compared to the T -dependence\nbrought by the fluctuations of \u03be fi and will not be considered here. So we will neglect in\nthe following the fluctuations of ri , \u03bbi and \u03beci and focus on the fluctuations of \u03be fi only.\nThen h\u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd )i is simply given by\nR\n\n( D\u03befi \u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd , r0 , \u03bb0 , \u03befi , \u03bec0 ) exp[\u2212\u03bef2i /(2\u03c3f2 )])\nR\nh\u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd )i =\n.\n( D\u03befi exp[\u2212\u03bef2i /(2\u03c3f2 )])\n\n(11)\n\nEqs. (10-11) are the basic equations of the paper from which the dynamical spin\nsusceptibility is extracted and the critical phenomena around the quantum critical point\n(QCP) are studied. Let us note that, when the averages acting on the various bubbles\n\u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd ) in Eq.(9) are omitted, one recovers the standard results of the random phase\napproximation. As pointed out by Lonzarich and Taillefer [30], the corresponding selfconsistent renormalized spin fluctuation SCR-SF procedure can be analyzed within the\nGinzburg-Landau formalism in which the local free energy is expanded in terms of a\nsmall and slowly varying varying order parameter m(r) as f (r) = f0 + 21 a |m(r)|2 +\nP\n2\n1\nb |m(r)|4 + 21 c |\u2207mi (r)| + O(6) and the following approximation is made |m(r)|4 =\n4\nD\n\ni\n\nE\n\nE\n\nD\n\n|m(r)|2 |m(r)|2 . Hence |m(r)|2 is evaluated via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nIII. DYNAMICAL SPIN SUSCEPTIBILITY\n\nLet us now derive the expression of the dynamical spin susceptibility.

In the low frequency limit, one can easily check that the dynamical spin susceptibility may be written in terms of intra- and inter-band suceptibilities\ncorresponding respectively to particle-hole pair excitations within the lower \u03b1 band and\nfrom the lower \u03b1 to the upper \u03b2 band.\n\u03c7f f (q, i\u03c9\u03bd ) =\n\nD\n\nh\u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (q, i\u03c9\u03bd )i + \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (q, i\u03c9\u03bd )\nD\n\nE\n\n1 \u2212 JS2 h\u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (q, i\u03c9\u03bd )i \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (q, i\u03c9\u03bd )\n\nE.\n\n(15)\n\nThe expressions of the susceptibilities \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (q, i\u03c9\u03bd ) and \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (q, i\u03c9\u03bd ) corresponding\nto intra- and inter-band particle-hole excitations are given in Appendix B. The latter\nexpression is reminiscent of the behaviour proposed by Bernhoeft and Lonzarich [31] to\nexplain the neutron scattering observed in UP t3 with the existence of both a \"slow\" and\na \"fast\" component in \u03c7\" (q, \u03c9)/\u03c9 due to spin-orbit coupling. Also in a phenomenological\nway, the same type of feature has been suggested in the duality model developed by\nKuramoto and Miyake [32]. To our knowledge, the proposed approach provides the first\nmicroscopic derivation from the Kondo lattice model of such a behaviour. Expanding\nthe various susceptibilities \u03c6(q, i\u03c9\u03bd , r0 , \u03bb0 , \u03befi , \u03bec0 ) up to the second order in \u03befi , and\nmaking use of Eq. (11), one can draw from Eq.

We will successively present now (i) in section IV, the\nresult for the dynamical spin susceptibility in the random phase approximation (RPA)\ngiving information on the nature of the collective mode that is involved; (ii) then in\nsection V, the implications of that mode in the critical phenomena around the quantum\ncritical point.\n\n8\n\n\fIV. RPA-DYNAMICAL SPIN SUSCEPTIBILITY NEAR THE\nANTIFERROMAGNETIC WAVE VECTOR : DISCUSSION ON THE NATURE\nOF THE COLLECTIVE MODE\n\nAs pointed out at the end of section II, the random phase approximation (RPA)\ncorresponds to the absence of any averaging in the different equations. Thereby the\nexpression of the dynamical spin susceptibility at the RPA level is given by Eq. (16)\ntaking \u03c3f2 = 0. We now discuss the q- and \u03c9- dependence of the RPA dynamical spin\nsusceptibility around the antiferromagnetic wave-vector Q.\nThe bare intraband susceptibility \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (Q + q, \u03c9) is well approximated at |q| \u226a |Q|\n\u2032\nby a lorentzian \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (Q + q, \u03c9) = \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 /(1 \u2212 i\u03c9/\u03930 + bq 2 ) where \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 = \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1 (Q, 0) and\n\u03930 is the relaxation rate of order |yF | = TK . As expected for the antiferromagnetic\ncase, the relaxation rate remains finite when q goes to zero reflecting the fact that the\nfluctuations of the order parameter are not conserved. The bare interband susceptibility\n\u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (Q + q, \u03c9) can be considered as purely real and frequency independent equal to \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\nin the low frequency limit. Fig.3 gives the continuum of the intraband and interband\nparticle-hole excitations \u03c7\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u03b1 6= 0 and \u03c7\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u03b2 6= 0. Due to the presence of the hybridization\ngap in the density of states, the latter continuum displays a gap ranging from 2\u03c30 , the\nvalue of the direct gap for the wave-vector 0, to 2 |yF |, the value of the indirect gap at\nQ. The RPA dynamical spin susceptibility is given by\nA \u2032\u2032\n\u03c7RP\n(Q + q, \u03c9) = \u03c9\nff\n\n\u03c7\u2032f f (Q + q)\u0393(q)\n\u03c9 2 + \u0393(q)2\n\n(18)\n\nwith\n\u03c7\u2032f f (Q + q) =\n\n\u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 + \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\n(1 \u2212 Iq )\n\n\u0393(q) = \u03930 (1 \u2212 Iq )\nwhere Iq = I \u2212 bq 2 and I = JS2 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 (of order 1 near the antiferromagnetic instability).\n\u2032\nThe bulk staggered susceptibility \u03c7f f (Q) diverges at I = 1. The frequency depenA \u2032\u2032\ndence of \u03c7RP\n(Q + q, \u03c9) is a lorentzian with a vanishing relaxation rate \u0393(0) at the\nff\nantiferromagnetic transition. The corresponding excitation can be analyzed as an antiferromagnetic paramagnon mode that softens at the magnetic transition. Eq. (18)\nprovides us with the dispersion of that mode. The corresponding dynamical exponent z\nis found to be equal to 2 due to the overdamping of the mode when enters the continuum\nof the \u03b1-\u03b1 particle-hole excitations. We will show how the dynamic exponent z strongly\naffects the static critical behavior. This is due to the fact that, contrary to the T > 0\nphase transitions, statics and dynamics are intimately linked in quantum (T = 0) phase\ntransitions. We turn now to the resulting quantum-classical crossover occuring at finite\ntemperature.\n\n9\n\n\fV. CRITICAL PHENOMENA AROUND THE ANTIFERROMAGNETIC\nQUANTUM CRITICAL POINT (AF-QCP)\n\nThe parameter which controls the temperature dependence of the thermodynamical\nvariables near the AF-QCP is \u03c3f2 which expresses the thermal local fluctuations of the\nstaggered magnetization. Using Eqs. (17) and (18)\n\u03c3f2 =\n\nX\nq\n\nS(Q + q) \u223c\n\nZ\n\nS(Q + q)q d\u22121 dq,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere S(Q + q) is the static form factor\nS(Q + q) =\n\n3\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ncoth(\u03b2\u03c9/2)\u03c7f\u2032\u2032f (Q + q, \u03c9)d\u03c9.\n\n(20)\n\nDepending on the temperature-scale considered, quantum or classical behavior is\nobserved. In general, the thermal fluctuations \u03c3f2 of the magnetization should depend\non the total self-consistent renormalized dynamical spin susceptibility \u03c7f f \"(Q + q, \u03c9)\nas defined in Eq.(15). However, in practice, we will content with its truncated form\nA \u2032\u2032\n\u03c7RP\n(Q + q, \u03c9) derived at the RPA level. The temperature dependence of the static\nff\nform factor S(Q + q) is given by\nS(Q + q) =\n\nT\n6T \u2032\n\u03c7f f (Q + q) tan\u22121 (\n).\n\u03c0\n\u0393(q)\n\n(21)\n\nA first cross-over temperature TI = 2\u03930 (1 \u2212 I) appears which separates the quantum\nfrom the classical regime\n(i) T < TI : quantum regime. One can show that the static form factor S(Q + q)\nexhibits a quadratic temperature dependence\nS(Q + q) =\n\n6 \u03c7\u2032f f (Q + q) 2\nT ,\n\u03c0 \u03930 (1 \u2212 Iq )\n\n(22)\n\nThe thermal local fluctuations \u03c3f 2 of the magnetization are also quadratic as a function\nof the temperature. They can be easily evaluated from Eq.(21).\nTaking advantage of\nq\nd\u22121\nthe fact that the integrand S(Q + q)q\nis peaked at q1 = (1 \u2212 I)/b, the temperature\n2\ndependence of \u03c3f is also found to be quadratic\n\u03c3f 2 =\n\n3 \u03c7\u2032f f (Q) 2\nT ,\n2\u03c0 \u03930 (1 \u2212 I)\n\n(23)\n\nThe physics is quantum in the sense that the fluctuations on the scale of the magnetic\ncorrelation length \u03be have energy much greater that the temperature kB T .\n(ii) T > TI : classical regime. In this regime, the static form factor S(Q + q) shows\na linear temperature dependence. As long as q is smaller than the thermal cut-off q \u2217\ndefined by \u03c9max (q \u2217 ) = T , S(Q + q) takes the following form\n10\n\n\fS(Q + q) = 3\u03c7\u2032f f (Q + q)T.\n\n(24)\n\nThe thermal local fluctuations \u03c3f 2 of the magnetization are deduced from Eq. (21).\nThe main contribution arises from the integration over [q1 , q \u2217 ]. The result depends on\nthe dimensionality d. One finds \u03c3f 2 \u223c T 3/2 at d = 3 and \u03c3f2 \u223c T ln T at d = 2. This\nclassical regime corresponds to the case where the energy of the mode on the scale of \u03be\nbecomes less than kB T .\nTable I recapitulates the expressions that we get for the thermal local fluctuations\n2\n\u03c3f of the staggered magnetization depending on the temperature scale and on the dimensionality. Following Eq. (16), the staggered spin susceptibility is given by\n\u2032\n\n\u03c70f f (Q)\n\u03c7Q =\n,\n1 \u2212 I + \u03bb\u03c3f2\n\u2032\n\n(25)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c70f f (Q) = \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 +\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 . Incorporating the values of the thermal local fluctuations \u03c3f 2\nreported in Table I, we are able to identify a second cross-over temperature TII . Above\nTII , \u03c3f 2 becomes larger than (1 \u2212 I) and all the physical quantities are controlled\nby the temperature only. TII \u223c (1 \u2212 I)2/3 at d = 3 and TII \u223c (1 \u2212 I) at d = 2.\nAs expected in the two-dimensional case, the T = 0 transition is at its upper critical\ndimension since z + d = 4 in the antiferromagnetic case characterized by a dynamic\nexponent z = 2. That corresponds to the marginal case for which the intermediate\nregime TI < T < TII is squeezed out of existence. The results for the d = 3 and d = 2\ncases are respectively summarized in Figures 4 and 5 which picture the different regimes\nof behaviors reached depending on the values of the temperature T and of the control\nparameter I = J 2 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 . When I > 1, long-range antiferromagnetic order occurs when\nT is smaller than the N\u00e9el temperature TN . TN \u223c (I \u2212 1)2/3 at d = 3 and TN \u223c (I \u2212 1)\nat d = 2.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION\n\nThe low temperature physics is dominated by the presence of an antiferromagnetic\nparamagnon mode that softens at the magnetic transition. The results depend crucially\non the value of d + z where d is the spatial dimension and z is the dynamic exponent\nassociated to that mode. Due to the overdamping of the mode when it enters the\ncontinuum of intraband particle-hole excitations, the dynamic exponent z is found to\nbe equal to 2 in the antiferromagnetic case. As far as the dimensionality is concerned,\nthere is no doubt about the dimensionality associated with the heavy quasiparticles in\nthose systems that is clearly of 3. However the question about the dimensionality of the\ncritical magnetic fluctuations which the quasiparticles are coupled to, is still an open\nproblem. Up to now, it has been assumed that the critical fluctuations of the QPT are\ndominated by the three-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations. This would impose\na description by a quantum critical theory with d = 3, z = 2. Recently Rosch et al [28]\nproposed, on the basis of the neutron scattering data in CeCu6\u2212x Aux , that the critical\nmagnetic fluctuations are two-dimensional which leads to a QCP with d = 2, z = 2. Let\nus summarize the different regimes of behaviors that we get in each of those two cases\n11\n\n\f(z = 2 , d = 3 or 2) depending on the values of the temperature T and of the control\nparameter I = J 2 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 . As one can see, the results that we obtain are very similar to\nthose established by Hertz [20] and Millis [11] using renormalization group approaches\nin the spin-fluctuation theory.\n(i) Case d = 3. A long-range antiferromagnetic phase occurs when I > 1 below\nthe N\u00e9el temperature TN \u223c (I \u2212 1)2/3 . A first cross-over temperature TI \u223c (1 \u2212 I)\nseparates the quantum from the classical regime. In the regime I (I < 1) and T < TI ),\nthe physics is quantum in the sense that the energy of the relevant mode on the scale of\n\u03be is greater than the temperature kB T . Since d + z > 4, the T = 0 phase transition is\nabove its upper critical dimension and the various physical quantities depend upon the\nparameter\nI. The magnetic correlation length diverges at the magnetic transition \u03be \u223c\nq\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1/ (1 \u2212 I) and the staggered spin susceptibility behaves as \u03c7Q = \u03c70f f (Q)/(1 \u2212 I + aT 2 ).\nRegime II and III are both classical regimes characterized by large thermal effects since\nthe fluctuations on the scale of \u03be have energy much smaller than kB T . In Regime\nII\nq\n2/3\n(TI < T < TII with TII \u223c (1 \u2212 I) ), the magnetic correlation length \u03be \u223c 1/ (1 \u2212 I)\nis still controlled by (1 \u2212 I) even though modes at the scale of \u03be have energies less\nthan kB T . On the contrary, the staggered spin susceptibility is sensitive to the thermal\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfluctuations \u03c7Q = \u03c70f f (Q)/(1 \u2212 I + aT 3/2 ). In Regime III (T > TII ), the thermal\n\u2032\ndependence of physical quantities becomes universal and both \u03be and \u03c7Q are controlled\n\u2032\n\u2032\nby the temperature : \u03be \u223c 1/T 3/4 and \u03c7Q = \u03c70f f (Q)/T 3/2 .\n(ii) Case d = 2. Then, since z = 2, z + d = 4 and the T = 0 phase transition\nis at its upper critical dimension. The physics is qualitatively similar to the case d =\n3 with stronger fluctuation effects particularly in the classical regime. A long-range\nantiferromagnetic phase occurs when I > 1 below the N\u00e9el temperature TN \u223c (I \u2212 1).\nFor d = 2, the two cross-over temperatures TI and TII coincide so that Regime II\nof Figure 4 is squeezed out of existence. Regime I (T < TI with TI \u223c (1q\u2212 I)) is\nthe quantum regime in which the thermal fluctuations are negligible : \u03be \u223c 1/ (1 \u2212 I)\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand \u03c7Q = \u03c70f f (Q)/(1 \u2212 I + aT 2 ). Regime III (T > TI ) is the unique classical regime\ncharacterized by very strong fluctuation effects since kB T is larger than the energy of\nthe relevant mode on the scale of \u03be . Both the magnetic correlation length \u221a\nand the\nstaggered spin susceptibility are then controlled by the temperature : \u03be \u223c 1/ T ln T\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand \u03c7Q = \u03c70f f (Q)/(T ln T ).\nVII. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe considered the S = 1/2 Kondo lattice model in a self-consistent one-loop approximation starting from a generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation of the Kondo\ninteraction term. The model exhibits a zero temperature magnetic phase transition at\na critical value of the Kondo coupling. The transition is usually antiferromagnetic but\nit may be incommensurate depending on the bandstructure considered. The low temperature physics is controlled by a collective mode that softens at the antiferromagnetic\ntransition with a dynamic exponent z equal to 2.\n12\n\n\fA quantum-classical crossover occurs at a temperature TI related to the characteristic energy-scale of that mode. Heavy-fermion systems are usually believed to be\n3-dimensional. However since some recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments performed in CeCu6\u2212x Aux show that the critical magnetic fluctuations which the quasiparticles are coupled to, are 2-dimensional, we both considered the cases d = 2 and d = 3\nwith z = 2. The low-temperature behavior of the system is deduced, with predictions\nfor the temperature dependence of the physical quantities such as the magnetic correlation length \u03be and the staggered susceptibility \u03c7\u2032Q . A second crossover temperature\nTII appears above which the thermal dependence of \u03be and \u03c7\u2032Q becomes universal and is\nuniquely controlled by the temperature. It would be very interesting now to study the\ntemperature behavior of other physical quantities as the specific heat or the transport\nproperties.\nA number of significant issues remain to be addressed. Among others, we will mention the possibility of getting a different value of the dynamic exponent for instance\nz = 1 if nesting effects are considered corresponding to an absence of damping of the\nmode when located in the gap of excitations around the antiferromagnetic vector. Disorder is expected to play a crucial role in this problem. In that direction, some recent\nworks [34,17] pointed out the formation of some \"hot lines\", i.e., points at the Fermi\nsurface linked by the magnetic Q vector. On the hot lines, the quasiparticle scattering\nrate is linear in temperature while, away from the hot lines, it acquires the standard\nFermi liquid form in T 2 . At low temperature, the \"cold\" regions are shown to shortcircuit the scattering near those lines, and induce a T 2 behavior of the resistivity. The\ndisorder is found to emphasize the contribution of the hot lines, eventually leading to a\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior. It would be worthy to study the effects of the \"hot lines\" in\npresence of disorder within the critical phenomena description presented in this paper.\nWe would like to thank Nick Bernhoeft, Piers Coleman, Jacques Flouquet, Patrick\nA.

The low-lying excitations are\nquasiparticles of large effective mass m\u2217 as observed in heavy-Fermion systems. Also\nnote the presence of a hybridization gap between the \u03b1 and the \u03b2 bands. The direct\ngap of value 2\u03c30 is much larger than the indirect gap equal to 2|yF |.
