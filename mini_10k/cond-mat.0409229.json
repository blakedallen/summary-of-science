The effects\nof the interplay of diffusive and ballistic motion in the\ncase of fractal aggregates has been considered only recently [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The relative\nstrength of these two mechanisms will vary with cluster\nsize. This is the case, for example, in colloidal suspensions, where both the diffusivity and the sedimentation\nvelocity are usually expected to depend algebraically on\ncluster size. In this paper we study the effect of these\ntwo processes on the cluster structure.\nThe present understanding of colloidal aggregation\nunder gravitation is as follows. According to experiments [6, 8] sedimenting clusters do not rotate, their\nanisotropy is independent of their size, and they have\nno preferred orientation. Based on a scaling relationship\nbetween cluster size and sedimentation velocity the sedimenting clusters are argued to be self-similar and their\nfractal dimension to be significantly larger than that in\ndiffusion-limited aggregation. The restructuring of particles inside a cluster caused by hydrodynamic stresses was\nclaimed to be the reason for sedimenting clusters being\nmore compact. Recent simulations [9, 10] have shown\nthat even without restructuring it is possible to produce\nclusters with an apparent fractal dimension that is close\nto the value observed in experiments, if there is a ve-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ppv@fyslab.hut.fi\naddress: ehe@fyslab.hut.fi\n\u2021 Electronic address: mja@fyslab.hut.fi\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nlocity difference between clusters of different sizes. The\ncross-over to the sedimentation-dominated regime can be\nmeasured by directly observing the average size of the\naggregates; however in this regime the fractal dimension\nstill follows DLCA-like scaling [13].\nIn this article we study scaling properties of clusters, which are formed in cluster-cluster aggregation\nwhen both the diffusivity and the sedimentation velocity depend algebraically on cluster size. This induces a\ncross-over from diffusion-limited aggregation to a process\nwhere large clusters grow while settling by aggregating\nsmaller clusters from a time-dependent size distribution,\nns (t). We are mainly interested in generic features and\nhence concentrate on two dimensions, in which the effects\nof sedimentation on cluster structure can be studied with\nthe most ease numerically. To compare our results to the\nexisting ones, we also consider other structural characteristics on a qualitative level. For quantitative studies one\nshould study more elaborate models with hydrodynamics and other delicate issues involved. The main focus\nhere is on the self-similarity of aggregates, which is the\ncrucial assumption made in the analysis of data in previous, similar studies. For this purpose, we consider the\nscaling of four radii as a function of cluster size. These\nare indicated in figure 1.\nOur main result is that sedimenting clusters are not\nself-similar fractals. Hence, an algebraic relationship as assumed a priori here - between cluster velocity and\nits mass does not necessarily imply self-similarity of the\naggregates. The mean cluster width, considered in the\ndirection perpendicular to the sedimentation velocity,\ngrows algebraically as a function of cluster size but the\nmean cluster height does not follow a simple power-law,\nat least not in the size range considered. It is an open\nquestion as to whether the asymptotic scaling of the clusters transverse to the velocity follows the mean cluster\nwidth, or, vice versa; much larger simulations are needed\nto settle this issue. Also the principal radii of gyration,\n\n\f2\nconcludes the paper.\n\nII.\n\nFIG. 1: Illustration of the principal radii of gyration rmin and\nrmax calculated from the radius of gyration matrix T and the\nradii rx and ry , which point perpendicular and parallel to the\nsedimentation velocity (shown by the thick arrow), respectively. The longer side of the rectangle shown equals to the\nmaximal distance between any of the particles of the cluster\nand the angles \u03c6 and \u03b8 are used to measure the orientation\nwith respect to the direction of the sedimentation velocity.\n\ngiven by the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration matrix\n(see Fig. 1 and Eq. (5)), grow with rates that are not\nequal. We present a scaling argument that explains how\nthe width grows algebraically but simultaneously leaves\nthe origin of the actual value of the exponent open. The\nfact that this particular quantity exhibits scaling brings\nup some interesting issues, like where does the universal,\nPeclet-number independent value originate from?\nThe difference in the growth rates indicates that clusters can not be described simply using the fractal dimension and methods relying on isotropic scaling properties. For example, studies using the radius of gyration\ngive only an effective measure for the cluster structure.\nAnisotropic growth also implies that the cluster shape\nand its structure change in time, and we consider the\nformer in particular in detail. We also analyze the orientation of clusters and discuss the similarities and differences between our results and previous experimental and\nnumerical studies of the same phenomenon [8, 9, 10].\nThis paper is organized as follows. The model is defined in section II. A simulation method becoming the\nefficient the larger clusters become is introduced in section III. The scaling properties using the radius of gyration matrix are studied in section IV. Section V considers the anisotropy and orientation of clusters. Section VI\n\nMODEL\n\nConsider fractal clusters aggregating in a suspension.\nThe sedimentation caused by gravitation may be ignored for aggregates with characteristic radii smaller\nthan about 1 \u03bcm. In this region the essential features\nof the growth are well described by the diffusion-limited\ncluster-cluster aggregation (DLCA) model [1, 14]. The\nidea is that clusters move diffusively, and the diffusion\nconstant depends algebraically on cluster size: D(s) \u223c\ns\u03b3 . For a cluster diffusing in a quiescent fluid it can be\nargued that the diffusion exponent \u03b3 = \u22121/df , where df\nis the fractal dimension of the cluster [15, 16, 17]. Whenever clusters (particles are clusters of size one) collide,\nthey irreversibly aggregate together. No cluster restructuring is allowed.\nBoth the dynamics and the structure of clusters formed\nin the DLCA are well understood [1, 14]. Defining the\nnumber of clusters of size s at time t as ns (t), the\ncluster size distribution obeys dynamic scaling ns (t) =\nS(t)\u22122 f (s/S(t)), where the exponent \u22122 follows from\nmass\nand the average cluster size S(t) =\nP\nP 2 conservation\nz\ns sns \u223c t with z being the dynamic expos s ns /\nnent. In two dimensions the fractal dimension of clusters\nis df = 1.44 \u00b1 0.02 [18, 19] and including rotational diffusion or varying the value of \u03b3 has no essential effect on\nit [1, 14]. The anisotropy measured using the ratio of the\nprincipal axis of gyration is about 2.4 [20].\nHere the DLCA model is considered in the presence\nof the sedimentation of clusters. The force exerted on\na cluster sedimenting in a fluid consists of the buoyancy\nforce F~b = V \u2206\u03c1~g and the viscous drag force F~d = \u2212C~v ,\nwhere V is the volume of the object (for an aggregate\nconsisting of s particles it is s times the volume of a\nsingle particle), \u2206\u03c1 = \u03c1p \u2212 \u03c1f is the difference between\nparticle and fluid densities, ~g is the acceleration due to\ngravity, ~v is the sedimentation velocity and C is a positive constant depending on the specific form of the cluster [21]. For a ball of radius r the constant C = 6\u03c0\u03b7r,\nwhere \u03b7 is the kinematic viscosity. For complicated, say\nfractal-like objects, C is generally unknown and we make\nthe usual assumption that the aggregate will behave as\na compact object with an effective hydrodynamic radius\nRh , i.e. C \u223c Rh [15, 16, 22]. If one further assumes\na scaling relation between Rh and s, the sedimentation\nvelocity depends algebraically on cluster size v(s) \u223c s\u03b4 ,\nwhere \u03b4 is the sedimentation exponent. For a fractal one\nd\nwould have s \u223c Rhf resulting in \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 1/df but here\nwe just take this as an assumption since it is not a priori\nclear that the ensuing clusters are fractals with respect\nto drag resistance. As \u03b3 < 0 and \u03b4 > 0 aggregation\nis diffusion-limited for small clusters but becomes dominated by sedimentation for large ones.\nThe model described above neglects many issues related to real suspensions such as hydrodynamic interac-\n\n\f3\ntions, restructuring and rotation of clusters by diffusion\nor at aggregation to mention a few. However, our purpose is not to try to simulate all aspects of sedimentation driven aggregation but rather elucidate what kind\nof universal behavior one could expect to have. Hence,\nthe results reported should be considered on a qualitative level when comparing to experiments. We discuss\nfurther these issues and the assumptions behind \u03b3 and \u03b4\nin the conclusions, in the light of the simulation results\nobtained.\nA useful measure for the relative strengths of diffusion\nand sedimentation is the Peclet number [23]\nPe (s) = v(s)r/D(s),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r is the radius of a single particle and v = |~v |. As\nthe Peclet number depends on cluster size, in the following we use the one particle Peclet number Pe = Pe (1).\nFigure 2 shows examples of clusters formed in simulations\nfor different values of Pe.\n\nIII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS\n\nThe simulations are done on a two-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Initially a concentration \u03c6 of lattice sites are filled randomly. One\nfilled lattice site is considered as a single particle. In\nthe dynamics a particle or a cluster consisting of particles is selected randomly and time is incremented by\nN (t)\u22121 \u03a9\u22121\nmax , where N (t) is the number of clusters at\ntime t and \u03a9max is the maximum mobility of any of the\nclusters at that time. The cluster mobility is defined as\n\u03a9(s) = p\u2193\u2193 (s)+p\u2193\u2191 (s)+2p\u22a5 (s), where p\u2193\u2193 (s), p\u2193\u2191 (s), and\np\u22a5 (s) are proportional to the probabilities for a cluster\nof size s to move in the direction of the field, opposite to\nit and to the directions perpendicular to it, respectively.\nThe selected cluster (of size s) is moved if x < \u03a9(s)/\u03a9max ,\nwhere x \u2208 (0, 1) is a random number selected from a uniform distribution. If the selected cluster is not moved the\nsimulation proceeds by selecting another cluster, otherwise another random number y \u2208 (0, 1) is selected from\na uniform distribution. The cluster is moved to the field\ndirection if y \u2264 p\u2193\u2193 (s)/\u03a9(s), opposite to the field direction if p\u2193\u2193 (s)/\u03a9(s) < y \u2264 [p\u2193\u2193 (s) + p\u2193\u2191 (s)]/\u03a9(s), and\notherwise to one of the directions perpendicular to the\nfield with equal probabilities (= p\u22a5 (s)/\u03a9(s)). If after the\nmove the cluster has no overlap with others the move is\naccepted and another cluster is selected randomly. Otherwise the move is taken back and the cluster is aggregated with all the clusters it attempted to overlap before\nselecting a new cluster for the next attempt.\nThe terms p\u2193\u2193 (s), p\u2193\u2191 (s), and p\u22a5 (s) are of the form\n\u0001\n4Ck s\u03b3 + C\u2193 s\u03b4 + C\u21932 s2\u03b4 /2\n\u0001\np\u2193\u2191 (s) = 4Ck s\u03b3 \u2212 C\u2193 s\u03b4 + C\u21932 s2\u03b4 /2\np\u22a5 (s) = 2C\u22a5 s\u03b3 ,\np\u2193\u2193 (s) =\n\n(2)\n\nwhere C\u2193 , Ck , and C\u22a5 are non-negative constants chosen\nsuch that p\u2193\u2191 (s) > 0 for all cluster sizes. This choice gives\nfor the sedimentation velocity vs = C\u2193 s\u03b4 and for the diffusivities Dk (s) = Ck s\u03b3 and D\u22a5 (s) = C\u22a5 s\u03b3 , in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the field, respectively.\nIn the following we consider only the case Ck = C\u22a5 and\ndenote D(s) = Dk (s) = D\u22a5 (s). Physically, only the ratio\nof the sedimentation velocity to the diffusion constant is\nrelevant and hence we report the results as a function of\nthe one particle Peclet number Pe = C\u2193 /C\u22a5 . The exponents are taken to be \u03b3 = \u22120.70 and \u03b4 = 0.30, which\nare obtained from relations \u03b4 = 1 + \u03b3 and \u03b3 = \u22121/df\nusing the fractal dimension of DLCA clusters df = 1.44.\nThis is of course a valid choice initially, when DLCA is\nthe dominating process. It should be underlined that the\nmain point in these values is that eventually sedimentation will prevail, and that the both transfer mechanisms\nobey an algebraic dependence on the cluster size s.\nIt is known that in DLCA cluster structure, and especially the effectuve fractal dimension, depends on concentration [28]. In simulations reported here, the concentration is kept fixed to \u03c6 = 0.01. The DLCA calculations\nare done on a lattice of size Lk \u00d7 L\u22a5 = 4000 \u00d7 4000\nand when sedimentation is included 15000 \u00d7 2000 unless\nstated otherwise. To minimize finite size effects, all the\nsimulations are run under the conditions that none of the\nparticles has traveled the size of the lattice in the sedimentation direction and the size of the largest clusters is\nsmaller than half of the lattice size in any direction.\nThe above choice for p\u2193\u2193 (s), p\u2193\u2191 (s), and p\u22a5 (s) assumes\nthat sedimentation does not have any effect on the diffusion properties of a cluster. This may not be the case\nas the velocity fluctuations of sedimenting, compact, and\nnon-aggregating particles are larger in the sedimentation\ndirection than perpendicular to it [24, 25, 26]. The dependence of the strength of fluctuations on aggregate size\nis unknown, so we make the choice of isotropic fluctuations. The precise form of fluctuations should be unimportant as the upper critical dimension for sedimentation\ndriven aggregation is expected to be one [27].\nNext we shortly discuss the implementation of the algorithm. It is constructed to be efficient for low concentrations and for large cluster sizes. Although the method\nis described using a two-dimensional lattice, the generalization to higher dimensions and the continuum case is\nstraightforward.\nEach cluster is represented by a virtual rectangle,\nwhose size is the smallest possible one to enclose the\ncluster such that two sides of the rectangle are parallel to the sedimentation velocity (see Fig. 2). The sites\nbelonging to a cluster are stored with respect to the, say,\nlower left corner of the enclosing rectangle, for two reasons. The first one is to minimize the time needed to\nmove a cluster. Regardless of the cluster size a move can\nbe performed by updating one single value i.e. either the\nx- or y-coordinate of the lower left corner of the enclosing\nrectangle. The second reason deals with the collisions of\nclusters. It is fast first to check if the rectangles overlap\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: Typical clusters formed in simulations for Pe = 0.01, 1, and 10 (from left to right). They have 41167, 87585, and 80512\nparticles and are contained in rectangles of size 688 \u00d7 942, 1169 \u00d7 1307 and 1373 \u00d7 1625, respectively. The sedimentation\nvelocity points downwards.\n\neach other and only if they do to check for the overlap of\nthe clusters.\nObviously it would be very time-consuming to compare the rectangle that is moved to all the other rectangles. Hence, the whole system is divided into rectangular blocks and clusters are identified to belong into\nblocks according to the rectangles enclosing them. Then\nonly clusters belonging to the same block(s) have to be\nchecked.\nFigure 3 compares CPU-times using the implementation described above to that with a \"traditional\" algorithm, where clusters are represented as occupied sites\non a lattice and moved site by site. For average cluster\nsize smaller than about ten the traditional algorithm is\nfaster as one needs only to compare the occupancy of\na few sites. On the other hand, for large clusters the\nmethod using enclosing rectangles becomes much faster,\nbeing independent of cluster size, and usually only a couple of comparisons are needed to check the overlap of a\ncluster with others. In the \"traditional\" implementation\none needs of order S(t) comparisons, which slows down\nthe computation considerably when S(t) becomes large.\nIn the simulations reported here the \"traditional\"\nmethod is used for S(t) < 10 and the \"rectangle\" one\nfor S(t) > 10. Hence, most of the computation time\nis used when the average cluster size is small. To obtain good statistics from the interesting, large cluster\nsize region, we further apply a cloning method. It has\nproved to be efficient in many applications including, for\nexample, studies of percolation clusters, native states of\npolymers, and reaction-diffusion systems [29]. The basic idea is simple: at a fixed average cluster size Scopy\none makes ncopy copies of the cluster configuration and\n\ncontinues the Monte Carlo simulation independently for\neach of these systems. We use Scopy = ncopy = 10. We\ntested that the results obtained using copying were indistinguishable from the ones obtained without it. The\naverages reported in this article are taken over 40 runs\nwithout copying and 10 runs which were copied 10 times.\nTo increase the scaling window further would necessitate\nenormous CPU resources; even with the algorithm presented above we estimate that to augment the maximum\ncluster size by one order of magnitude would require of\nthe order of one CPU-year on a fast computer.\nNote that in the range of s-values shown, the typical\nscaling of S(t) is not algebraic manifesting a cross-over\nfrom diffusive to sedimentation-dominated dynamics [27].\nSince in the asymptotic regime the mean-field dynamic\nexponent z = 1/(1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 1/deff ), for any reasonable value\nof deff (the effective fractal dimension) z will have a value\nmuch larger than unity, and the cross-over effects are\nnoticeable since the DLCA value is much smaller.\nIV.\n\nSCALING PROPERTIES OF CLUSTERS\n\nComplex aggregates are often characterized be their\nfractal dimension df , which can be found by the relation\nof the cluster size to its characteristic radius\ns \u223c hRidf ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the brackets denote averaging over clusters of size\ns.

The larger and smaller eigenvalues of\nT , denoted by \u03bbmax and \u03bbmin , respectively, are related\nto the radius of gyration by Rg2 = \u03bbmax + \u03bbmin . The\nsquare roots of the eigenvalues, called the principal radii\n1/2\nof gyration, rmax,min = \u03bbmax,min , may be considered as\nlengths of an ellipsoid describing the cluster shape and\nthe corresponding normalized eigenvectors ~emax and ~emin\ndefine the directions of the principal axes. The preferred\ndirection is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the\nlarger eigenvalue. We further consider the radii in the\ndirections perpendicular and parallel to the field, which\n1/2\nare related to the T by the relations rx = Txx and ry =\n1/2\nTyy , respectively, and to the radius of gyration by Rg2 =\nrx2 +ry2 . Figure 1 depicts the four radii for a cluster formed\nwith Pe = 0.1 and of size 90110.\nFigures 4 (a) and 5 (a) show the growth of the average\nradii defined above as a function of the cluster size for\nPe = 1 and Pe = 10, respectively. Although the growth\nseems rather similar for different radii, the local slopes\n(shown in Figures 4 (b) and 5 (b)) change continuously\nwith the cluster size. Only the radius perpendicular to\n\nthe field obeys nice scaling of form hrx i \u223c slx with lx =\n0.61 \u00b1 0.01.\nThe overall behavior for other Peclet values (Pe = 0.01\nand 0.1; not shown) is rather similar and, especially, the\nvalue of lx is independent of the Peclet number. For\ncomparison, Figure 6 shows the scaling of the radius of\ngyration [Eq. (4)] as function of cluster size for various\nPeclet numbers. The local slopes reveal that only for\nthe DLCA there is a scaling relation between these two.\nFor a non-zero Peclet number one has to consider the\nscaling using the radius of gyration matrix [Eq. (5)] or\nsome other observable not relaying on isotropic scaling.\nOne should emphasize that for all Pe > 0 any asymptotic\nbehavior is still far away in the range of accessible radii\nof gyration; the actual values reflect more the cross-over\nin the cluster shape and internal structure (density) than\na tendency to e.g. become compact in the limit t \u2192 \u221e.\nThis can be underlined by comparing with the scaling of\nthe quantities, in Figs. 4 and 5.\nThe reasons for the existence or lack of scaling with\nrespect to rx and ry can be considered by a simple scaling\nargument. If rx scales with s, then also its derivative with\n\nT\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\ns\n1X\n\ns\n\n(~ri,\u03b1 \u2212 ~rCM,\u03b1 )(~ri,\u03b2 \u2212 ~rCM,\u03b2 )\n\ni=1\n\n\f6\n2\n\nrespect to s does so.

This is simply so because (see Fig. 2) the\nroughness of the lower part of a cluster growing via sedimentation will also play a role: many of the smaller clusters will be \"swallowed\" inside the fjords opening downwards. It seems feasible that this leads to a change in\nthe compactness of aggregates, which in turn results in\na non-algebraic relationship between ry and s. This is\nin fact a \"restructuring\" process, related to the changing\ncompactness of aggregates.\nNote the analogy with single cluster growth in various\nballistic growth models (with shadowing, see Ch. 5.7.2\nof [30]). There it is known that the bulk of the cluster\nbecomes compact (df = d), and that the boundary of\nthe cluster undergoes interesting roughening behavior. In\nour case, lx does not show signs of such a cross-over (to\ncompact geometry) though ly might do so asymptotically.\nThe equivalence to cluster growth is by no means clear\nin our case since the \"deposited\" clusters are sampled\nfrom the ns (t) at each t, the distribution of which is\nbroad (Fig. 7 demonstrates an example, see also ref. [31]).\nThese clusters have a typical width-to-height ratio depending on s, making the \"deposition problem\" much\nmore complicated than such ones usually are. This will\nremain true for any t, as the ns (t) remains non-trivial.\nThe implication is that for any finite Peclet number there\nshould be a slow cross-over process that depends selfconsistently on the ns (t) and on the cluster structure\nthat has been formed through sampling smaller clusters\nfrom the same. In any case, the fact follows that the\ncluster structure is anisotropic: the more recently aggregated parts of clusters are not scale-invariant with the\nparts that have been created earlier in the aggregation\nprocess.\nConsider next the local exponents. For typical cluster\nsizes the local exponents of hrmin (s)i and hrx (s)i seem to\nbe close to the same value (see Figs. 4 (b) and 5 (b)).\nAlso the slopes of hrmax (s)i and hry (s)i behave similarly\nfor large cluster sizes. This indicates that the cluster are\nelongated in the field direction, i.e., hry i > hrx i. The\nelongation is more pronounced for high Peclet numbers.\n\n\f7\n1\n\n100\n\n10\n0.6\nY\n\nN(s)\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\n100\n\ns\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFIG. 7: The averaged (40 runs) cluster size distribution ns (t)\nfor Pe = 1, at t = 1024.\n\nThe same conclusion is obtained by directly considering the angular distribution using the eigenvector corresponding to the larger eigenvalue (see Section V).\nAlthough in the size region studied hry i > hrx i, the local slope of hrx i is larger than that of hry i indicating that\nclusters grow faster in the direction perpendicular to the\nfield. This implies that very large clusters should become\nelongated perpendicular to the sedimentation direction.\nRough estimates for the crossover values are s = 8000,\n80000, and 300000 for Pe = 0.1, 1, and 10, respectively,\nand the corresponding radii of gyration 80, 200 and 500.\nThese values are, unfortunately, larger than we are able\nto simulate but should be achievable in experiments, see\nfor example [8]. The most important conclusion, is however a choice between two asymptotic scenarios. The\ndata implies that asymptotically hrx (s)i will scale with\nthe maximum radius. Hence, should this be the case,\nthere are two possiblities to begin with: either the maximum radius also starts to follow the hrx (s)i, with its\nscaling exponent (0.61 above), or then the asymptotic\nscaling of both could become volume-like (\u223c s0.5 ).\n\nV.\n\nANISOTROPY AND ORIENTATION\n\nNext we consider how the cluster shape evolves with\ntime. To have an easily comparable measure for clusters of different sizes, we consider the scaled half-width\nof a cluster as a function of its scaled height Y =\n(y \u2212 ymin )/(ymax \u2212 ymin ), where ymax and ymin are the\nmaximum and minimum y-coordinates of any of the particles in the cluster. The half-width at height Y is defined\nas\nw(Y ) =\n\n1 xmax (Y ) \u2212 xmin (Y )\n,\n2\nymax \u2212 ymin\n\n(9)\n\nwhere xmax and xmin are the maximum and minimum\nx-coordinates of any of the particles at that height.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n<w(Y)>\n\nFIG. 8: Average cluster half-width as a function of scaled\nheight for Pe = 0.01 (open symbols) and 10 (filled symbols).\nThe clusters are divided into four size categories: 2500 \u2212\n5000 ( ), 5000 \u2212 7500 (\u0003), 7500-10000(\u2666), 10000 \u2212 . . . (\u25b3).\n\nThe relative width of a cluster increases with size as\ncan be seen from Figure 8, in which the half-width is\nshown for two Peclet numbers. Note, that the relative\nwidth may well become larger than the height of a cluster. For Pe = 0.01 the clusters are symmetric with respect to the point Y = 0.5 but for Pe = 10 they are wider\nat the bottom. This is due to the fact that as large clusters sediment faster than small ones they gather mass at\nbottom side. In other words, the upper part of a cluster\nis shielded by its lower part. For large clusters this results\nin a triangular-like shape, a particularly nice example of\nwhich is shown in Fig. 2. The sedimentation driven aggregates are sparse and have complicated scaling properties (see Figs. 4 and 5) as the clusters formed in the\ndiffusion-dominated regime are themselves fractals. It is\nan open question as to what is the best characteristics of\nthis kind of anisotropic cluster shapes. One possibility\nwould be to look at the lower and upper parts separately\n(e.g. the widths thereof, after splitting the cluster at the\ncenter of mass).\nThe orientation of sedimenting clusters is considered\nusing the angle \u03c6 = arccos(~ey * ~emax ) between the eigenvector corresponding to the larger eigenvalue and the\nunit vector in the direction of the external field. Figure 9 shows the angular distribution for two values of the\nPeclet number.\nTo study the effect of cluster size on orientation the\nclusters are divided in five different size classes. There is\nno difference in orientation with respect to cluster size.\nThe main point, however, is that the clusters are orientated such that they prefer to have the longer principal axis aligned with the field and that the orientation\ndistribution depends on the Peclet number. For example, for Pe = 10, there are practically no clusters with\n\n\f8\n\n80\n\n60\n\n<\u03b8>\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n40\n\n\u03c6\n\n60\n\n0\n0\n\n80\n\nFIG. 9: Angular distribution with respect to the sedimentation direction for Pe = 1 (open symbols) and Pe = 10 (filled\nsymbols) and for several size classes: 1000 \u2212 2500 ( ), 25005000 (\u0003), 5000-7500 (\u2666), 7500 - 10000 (\u25b3) and 10000 . . .\n(\u25bd).\n\n\u03c6 > 45o . This is not in contrast to the conclusion made\nusing the half-width as there is an important difference\nbetween these two approaches, when one averages them\nover cluster sizes. The averaging of the principal radii\ngives information about the typical cluster shape whereas\naveraging cluster width takes into account the selection\nof a preferred direction. We believe, that if one could\nsimulate larger cluster sizes, another peak would start to\ngrow at \u03c6 = 90o .\nTo consider our simulations in the light of the\nthree-dimensional experiments we also calculate cluster\nanisotropy and orientation as in Ref. [8]. First, a cluster is enclosed in a rectangle, whose longer sides give the\nmaximal distance between any of the points in the cluster\nand the shorter ones just touch the cluster (see Fig. 1).\nThe cluster \"radius\" is defined as R = (L + l)/4, where L\n(l) denotes the length of the longer (shorter) edge. The\norientation is measured using the angle \u03b8 between the\nsedimentation velocity and the longer edge.\nFigure 10 shows the average anisotropy and the average orientation angle as a function of R. The averages\nare taken over intervals of length one, which explains the\nnoisiness of the data for large cluster sizes. There is a\nclear transient region, where both quantities vary with\ncluster size but for large clusters they become constant\nwithin statistical errors and the value of the anisotropy\nratio L/l \u2248 1.4. This is the same as the value of threedimensional clusters [8]. However, since rx and ry have\ndifferent scaling properties this would be a bit surprising, if it were the asymptotic value. It seems most likely\nthat the constant value reflects more the fact that the\nstatistics becomes sparse, with only a few clusters in this\nrange of R. One can compare the anisotropy to the ratio\nof rmax and rmin ; this starts for s small from the DCLA\nvalue and is thus different.

IV (s=80000).\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied the structure of two-dimensional clusters, which aggregate at contact and whose motion is\ndominated by diffusion for small cluster sizes and by sedimentation for large ones. Considering the eigenvalues\nof the radius of gyration matrix, we show that due to\nthe sedimentation the aggregates grow slower in the direction of the sedimentation velocity than perpendicular\nto it. Moreover, only the cluster width scales with cluster size and hence the clusters are not self-affine either,\nat the very least within the size range currently accessible in simulations. We underline that the data implies\na cross-over scale, at which the maximal cluster radius\n\n\f9\nwill begin to scale with the average cluster width, but no\nfurther conclusions can be drawn about this regime.\nInterestingly, the scaling exponent characterizing the\ngrowth of the width is independent of the Peclet number, which characterizes the strength of the influence of\nsedimentation on aggregation. It is the one that defines\n\"self-similarity\" in the growing aggregates, but only in\na limited sense since it concerns only a one-dimensional\ncharacteristics of the clusters (in contrast to e.g. a fractal dimension). The width scaling argument presented\nleaves open what the value of the width exponent would\nbe but hints about the reasons as to why scaling is obtained in this respect, only. Here the clear conclusion\nis that since the Peclet number has no influence on the\nvalue (\u2248 0.61) it appears to be a universal one, and as\nsuch should be measured experimentally. The value to\nbe obtained from three-dimensional experiments would\nhence be independent of the viscosity of the suspending\nliquid but not necessarily take the same value as obtained\nhere. Recent experiments have shown that the radius of\ngyration can be used to distinguish between the DLCA\nand sedimentation regimes, with a clear change in the\nrate of increase with time [13]. However, the fractal dimension was shown to initially remain at the corresponding DLCA value. We believe this underlines the fact that\nin such simulations as ours it is easier to concentrate on\nmeasures that characterize the behavior of the large aggregates, as for instance Rg (s).\nLet us next discuss the justification of the simulation\nrules with the asymmetric growth in mind. As far as\nthe growth is dominated by diffusion, the aggregates\nwill be self-similar and diffusion characterized through\nD(s) \u223c s\u03b3 is reasonable. When sedimentation starts\nto dominate this no longer holds but then the precise\ncharacterization of diffusion is unimportant anyway. In\nretrospect the algebraic dependence of the sedimentation\nvelocity on the cluster size is just a lucky choice, a posteriori justified by the fact that rx scales algebraically. On\nthe other hand, the relation \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 1/df is invalid. This\nraises the academic question that how does the value of\nthe universal exponent lx depend on the values of \u03b3 and\n\u03b4? One may argue as follows. As the fractal dimension\n\nof DLCA clusters is independent of \u03b3, it probably does\nnot change the scaling properties of sedimenting clusters\neither. However, \u03b4 may and probably will have an effect;\nat least on the universality grounds there is no reason\nwhy the value of lx would not change with \u03b4. It would of\ncourse be possible to attempt much more elaborate and\ntime-consuming simulations, in which the hydrodynamic\nradius of each aggregate is computed self-consistently.\n\n[1] P.

Larger clusters are always\nrelatively wider than their smaller counterparts. For\nsmall Peclet numbers the clusters are rather elliptic but\nthey became wider at the \"bottom part\" due to a shielding effect for large Peclet numbers. We also studied the\norientation of clusters with respect to the direction of\nthe sedimentation velocity. Clusters are oriented such\nthat their height is larger than the width, but eventually the situation should be the opposite as the cluster\nwidth grows faster than the height. The larger the Peclet\nnumber the stronger the cluster orientation anisotropy.\nThe inequality of the growth rates in different direction implies that the scaling properties of sedimenting\nclusters can not be studied using the radius of gyration,\nwhich implicitly assumes the clusters to scale similarly\nin different directions. As there exist data from experiments [8] and simulations [9, 10] considering aggregation\nof sedimenting clusters, it would be worthwhile to check\nfor the possibility of anisotropic growth in these cases,\ntoo. Experiments or simulations with larger aggregates\ncould also reveal if the height of sedimenting aggregates\nwill eventually scale with their size. It would definitely\nbe also of interest to make simulations in the three dimensional case, and if cluster restructuring or rotational\ndiffusion is allowed.\nAcknowledgments - The authors thank the\nAcademy of Finland, Center of Excellence program, for\nfinancial support.
