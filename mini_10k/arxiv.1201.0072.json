Buford Price, Chair\nWhen high-energy particles interact in dense media to produce a particle shower,\nmost of the shower energy is deposited in the medium as heat. This causes the medium\nto expand locally and emit a shock wave with a medium-dependent peak frequency on the\norder of 10 kHz. In South Pole ice in particular, the elastic properties of the medium\nhave been theorized to provide good coupling of particle energy to acoustic energy. The\nacoustic attenuation length has been theorized to be several km, which could enable a\nsparsely instrumented large-volume detector to search for rare signals from high-energy\nastrophysical neutrinos. We simulated a hybrid optical/radio/acoustic extension to the\nIceCube array, specifically intended to detect cosmogenic (GZK) neutrinos with multiple\nmethods simultaneously in order to achieve high confidence in a discovered signal and to\nmeasure angular, temporal, and spectral distributions of GZK neutrinos. Detecting \u223c100\n\nGZK events could help resolve the question of ultra-high cosmic ray acceleration and allow\n\nus to measure the total neutrino-nucleon cross section at \u223c100 TeV center-of-mass energy.\n\nOur simulation showed that such a hybrid array could detect 10-20 GZK neutrinos per year,\nhalf of which would be detected by both the radio and acoustic methods.\nThis work motivated the design, deployment, and operation of the South Pole\nAcoustic Test Setup (SPATS). The main purpose of SPATS is to measure the acoustic\nattenuation length, sound speed profile, noise floor, and transient noise sources in situ\nat the South Pole. We describe the design, performance, and results from SPATS. We\nmeasured the sound speed in the fully dense ice between 200 m and 500 m depth to be\n3878 \u00b1 12 m/s for pressure waves and 1975.8 \u00b1 8.0 m/s for shear waves. We measured the\n\n\f2\nacoustic amplitude attenuation length to be 316 \u00b1 105 m. We measured the background\nnoise floor to be Gaussian and very stable on all time scales from one second to two years.\nFinally, we have detected an interesting set of well-reconstructed transient events in over\none year of high quality transient data acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of what\nis next for SPATS and of the prospects for acoustic neutrino detection in ice.\n\nProfessor P.

Thank you to Rolf Nahnhauer, Sebastian B\u00f6ser, Delia Tosi, Kalle Sulanke, Christian Spiering, Bernhard Voigt, Elisa Bernardini,\nOxana Tarasova, and the whole IceCube group at DESY for being gracious hosts on several\nvery productive visits. Thanks also to the three restaurants in Zeuthen, where we spent\nmany hours first thinking about neutrino detector simulations and doing calculations on\nnapkins, then struggling with embedded Linux driver hacking for the SPATS DAQ, and\nfinally discussing results from SPATS (after successful installation in the ice!) over German\nbeers, Italian digestives, and Greek ouzos.\nThanks to Allan Hallgren, who hosted Sebastian and me for the first \"SPATS\nworking weeks\" to integrate the whole system in the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Laboratory in Uppsala, and\nwho worked harder and more joyfully than anyone else I've ever seen, during some tough\nand tiring seasons at the Pole. We could not have built SPATS without Spider Man the\n\n\f2\nsailor.\nThanks to the Berkeley guys: Andres Morey, David Hardtke, Ignacio Taboada,\nKurt Woschnagg, Kirill Filomonov, Ryan Bay, Bobby Rohde, and Michelangelo D'Agostino.\nI never thought a physics group could be so much fun. Thanks for New Orleans, for nights at\nthe kiddie table, for tie fridays and tie dinners, for coffee and lunch and coffee, for exploding\nstuff at the South Pole ten years ago, for the author list script, for the hooding and the\nchampagne cooler, and for the wall of love. As Kirill said, \"you can never have too much\nlove.\" Michelangelo, if you ever need someone to hold your hand on a flight to France, I'm\nthere. Go easy on the tires when you're parking.\nThanks to my two physics \"fathers,\" Giorgio Gratta and Buford Price, for supporting me while trusting me and giving me space to be independent and take on large\nresponsibilities, to make my own choices, and to grow into a mature scientist.\nThanks to my readers, Buford Price, Don Backer, and Bernard Sadoulet, and to\nmy collaborators, Rolf Nahnhauer, Delia Tosi, Naoko Kurahashi, and Christopher Wiebusch\nfor reading this dissertation closely and giving many valuable comments.\nFinally, thank you to my family: Aynsley, Mary, Matt, and Russell; and my friends:\nAlex S., Ann D., Becky B., Brenna H., Daisy P.

I've learned\nmore from you than a PhD could ever give me.\n\n\f3\n\nForeword\nLike many projects in particle physics and, increasingly, in astronomy, the work I\nreport here is the result of fruitful collaboration, both within the UC Berkeley Price group\nand with my collaborators in IceCube and in particular in SPATS. For the benefit of my\nthesis committee I summarize my own particular role in the work, as well as other projects\nI worked on in graduate school. I also give a brief account of the development of the SPATS\nproject from my perspective, focusing especially on the early development of SPATS.\nIn the first year of graduate school, I finished my work on the Study of Acoustic\nUltra-high energy Neutrino Detection (SAUND) project. I collaborated on this work with\nGiorgio Gratta and Nikolai Lehtinen. We developed a data acquisition system and installed\nit to read out seven underwater hydrophones at a naval array in the Bahamas. The system\nwas optimized to search for acoustic signals from ultra-high-energy neutrinos interacting in\nthe water. My personal responsibility in the project was to implement and install the data\nacquisition system, then to operate the experiment and analyze the data. This analysis\nwas published in the Astrophysical Journal [1]. Although our neutrino flux limit was not\ncompetitive with existing radio limits, it was the first search for astrophysical particles\nwith the acoustic method. It has been the only such limit for several years, although\nthe ACORNE group [2, 3] has now also determined a similar limit. In the Fall of 2003,\nGiorgio and I hosted the first acoustic neutrino detection workshop, which together with\nthe RADHEP workshop led to a series of successful ARENA workshops held so far in 2005,\n2006, and 2008, focusing on radio and acoustic detection of high energy particles.\nI've continued contributing to the SAUND project as a side project in graduate\nschool. Naoko Kurahashi and Giorgio Gratta have been doing most of the work, which\nconstitutes the SAUND-II project and is an order of magnitude more sensitive than SAUNDI. In this thesis I will not describe the SAUND work but instead refer you to [1] and [4].\nFrom water I turned to acoustic neutrino detection in ice and salt. This was\nbased on the theoretical work Buford Price had done to estimate how well acoustic waves\ncould propagate through both ice and salt. Starting with a productive visit to DESY\nZeuthen hosted by Rolf Nahnhauer in June 2004, I expanded the work I had done for\nSAUND to develop a software package for simulating acoustic neutrino detector arrays in\nwater, ice, and salt. The salt work was spurred by a SalSA workshop held at SLAC in\nFebruary 2005. In the spring of 2005, Buford, Sebastian B\u00f6ser, Rolf, Dave Besson and\n\n\f4\nI completed the simulation work that would motivate SPATS and the idea of a hybrid\nradio/acoustic/neutrino extension to IceCube [5]. For the simulation project, I generated\na common neutrino event set that we then fed to the three detector sub-arrays. Sebastian\nran the optical detector response simulation, Dave ran the radio simulation, and I ran the\nacoustic simulation. I then combined the output of the three sub-detector simulations to\ndetermine the neutrino sensitivity (effective volume vs. energy) and expected GZK event\nrate. These simulations indicated that we could detect more than 10 GZK events per year,\nwith about half of them detected by both the radio and the acoustic method, assuming the\ntheoretical acoustic attenuation model presented in [6], [7], and [8].\nAt the same time, we started designing an experimental setup to be deployed\nin IceCube holes at the South Pole, in order to measure the acoustic properties of the\nice in situ and determine the feasibility of acoustic neutrino detection there. This next\nstep was necessary to test the parameters we were assuming in our neutrino sensitivity\nsimulations, because many of them were theoretical estimates without experimental ground\ntruth. At the spring IceCube collaboration meeting in Berkeley in 2005, we (Buford Price\nand myself from Berkeley, Rolf Nahnhauer and Sebastian B\u00f6ser from DESY, and Allan\nHallgren from Uppsala) started sketching the design of SPATS, including the number of\nstrings, what instrumentation should be on each string, and how we would control it. Soon\nafterward Stephan Hundertmark, Per Olof Hulth, and Christian Bohm from Stockholm\nUniversity joined. The Berkeley group took responsibility for the data acquisition system\nincluding both the hardware and software. The DESY group was responsible for the in-ice\ninstrumentation, Uppsala for in-ice cables, and Stockholm for other surface equipment.\nThat summer (2005) we had regular phone calls to design what would be SPATS.\nI was responsible for designing the DAQ system, which meant that I spent much of the\nsummer researching various options for rugged computing to interface with the instrumentation in the ice, then ordering and testing the hardware. The first String PC arrived at\nthe end of Summer 2005, plunging me into months of hacking Linux embedded computing.\nWe could not get the solid state device that came with the systems to be readable, and\nfurthermore we had problems getting a stable operating system to run at all. Sebastian and\nI spent two caffeine-fueled months with Allan Hallgren in Uppsala University in the Fall\nof 2005, integrating the different SPATS components we had built at separate institutions,\ndesigning and building the Acoustic Junction Boxes, and testing everything.\nIn the winter of 2005-2006, Freija Descamps from Ghent University joined SPATS\n\n\f5\nand took on a large responsibility in testing and debugging the hardware of the first three\nstrings, for installation in the 2006-2007 season. Delia Tosi from DESY Zeuthen joined in\nthe summer of 2006 and also performed essential work on the final construction and testing\nof the first three strings. In the spring of 2006, Delia and Freija led the development of the\nretrievable pinger and String D hardware design and construction projects.\nYasser Abdou from Ghent joined soon after Freija and has focused on simulation\nstudies. The University of Wuppertal (Klaus Helbing, Timo Karg, and Benjamin Semburg)\nand RWTH Aachen groups also joined in 2006 and contributed toward String D development. The Wuppertal group has been responsible in particular for the HADES sensors. The\nAachen group (Christopher Wiebusch, Christian Vogt, Karim Laihem, Matthias Schunck,\nand Martin Bissok) developed the Aachen Acoustic Laboratory, featuring an IceTop tank\nin a freezer room, used to make large bubble-free ice blocks for sensor calibration and\nquantitative studies of the thermoacoustic effect in ice.\nFor the design, deployment, and commissioning of SPATS, my main responsibility\nwas the data acquisition system. In addition to selecting and designing the String PC\nsystems, I wrote most of the data acquisition software for SPATS. I started with a primitive\nset of software in the Fall of 2005, mostly featuring a single program that could read out\na single sensor channel with the option of simultaneously pulsing a transmitter either once\nor repeatedly. I continued expanding and improving the DAQ software during and after\ndeployment and commissioning. The software progressed from primitive to fully featured\nduring the first year of operation of SPATS (2007), with several milestones including GPS\ntime stamping, HV read-back readout, and long-duration threshold triggered acquisition to\ncomplement the forced-mode readout supported from the beginning.\nIn addition to the data acquisition software, I wrote and maintained an offline\nanalysis framework that several of us have used for SPATS analysis.\nI worked at the South Pole during three consecutive austral summer seasons (20052006, 2006-2007, and 2007-2008), for several purposes: IceCube string installation, IceCube\nStandard Candle installation, IceTop installation, SPATS string installation, and SPATS\npinger operation. Together with IceCube collaborators, I installed all four SPATS strings\nand participated in six of the ten retrievable pinger deployments. Those of us who had\nworked long hard hours in basement labs, slaving over tedious but interesting challenges\nto make SPATS a reality, were beaming during the successful deployment of each string\nand pinger. One friend who saw a photo of us after the first SPATS string deployment\n\n\f6\nsaid I looked like a new father, and indeed we were all happy fathers and mothers. This\nexcitement continued as we commissioned the array at the Pole and began the first data\ntaking campaigns, as well as long after we left our new children behind in the ice and got\nto know them from the North.\nI've contributed several pieces of analysis both at the science-results level and at the\nlower level of technical understanding of our detector. Especially in the beginning, SPATS\nhas benefitted from being a small enough project that analysis has been a collaborative\nprocess, often involving breakthroughs arising from discussions among multiple people.\nMuch of my own analysis effort was focused on using inter-string data to measure the\nattenuation length. This proceeded through a series of challenges, many of which were\novercome through improvements in data taking and analysis. One important discovery in\nthe process of this analysis was the presence of ADC clock drift in waveform averaging,\nwhich is now recognized to be an important feature in most of our analyses. I subsequently\ndeveloped several algorithms for correcting this clock drift, which have been used for many\nof our analyses. Another piece of low-level analysis was my work to explain that the strange\nspikes in our otherwise Gaussian noise amplitude histograms are due to binning effects in\nour ADC's.\nIn analyzing 2007-2008 pinger data, I realized that the mysterious \"after-pulses\" we\noriginally thought were reflections were actually shear waves. This was the first realization\nthat we detect shear waves (in addition to pressure waves) with SPATS, and we have\nsubsequently identified them from nearly all of our detected sources: in-ice transmitters,\nthe retrievable pinger operated in water, and ambient transients. The discovery of shear\nwave signals led me to focus on measuring both the pressure and shear wave speed vs.\ndepth, now our first SPATS measurement submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed\njournal. Finally, in the last year several of us have been analyzing data from the transients\ndata stream, our newest mode of SPATS operation and a rich data set. I completed the\nfirst analysis of this data with automated event reconstruction, discovering that we saw a\nhot spot in our data which we subsequently identified as an IceCube \"Rodriguez\" (Rod)\nwell. These are deep wells used as water reservoirs for the IceCube hot water drill system.\nSince then we have identified transient signals from most of the Rod wells drilled over the\nyears for IceCube construction, as well as from IceCube holes themselves. We have even\ndetected acoustic emission from an AMANDA Rod well last heated nine years ago.\nIn addition to my focus on acoustic research and development for IceCube, I helped\n\n\f7\nbuild a laser calibration device for IceCube (the \"Standard Candle\"). At Berkeley we built\ntwo of these devices, each of which features a pulsed Nitrogen laser pointed at the apex\nof a reflecting cone to generate a simulated Cherenkov cone in the ice. The two devices\nwere installed deep in the ice on two IceCube strings and have been used to validate and\ncalibrate the response of IceCube, both for position reconstruction and (especially) for the\nabsolute intensity calibration of IceCube, necessary to determine the energy of neutrinoinduced cascades. I was responsible for the optics in each of the two Standard Candles,\nwhich included mirrors, filters, fibers, and lenses to deliver the beam from the laser to the\ncone. This included two weeks of long nights at the South Pole in the 2007-2008 season\nto solve alignment problems that arose during shipping, capped by deploying the second\ndevice in the middle of the night and running it a few days later to see that it had survived\ndeployment to hundreds of atmospheres of pressure and was working well.\n\n\f8\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter we introduce the physics of extremely high energy neutrinos. We then explain\nthe mechanism of acoustic signal production by high energy particle showers and describe\nhow well it is currently understood in theory, in simulation, and in laboratory studies. We\nconclude with an overview of existing field studies exploring the use of acoustic techniques\nfor high energy neutrino detection.\n\n1.1\n\nAstrophysical neutrinos at extremely high energy (EHE)\nThe field of neutrino astronomy is progressing quickly. While no astrophysical\n\nsources of neutrinos have yet been detected other than the sun and Supernova 1987a, the\nBaikal, AMANDA, ANTARES, and IceCube experiments have set increasingly stringent\nlimits on neutrino fluxes over several orders of magnitude in energy, ruling out multiple\ntheoretical models in the process. Each of these experiments uses the optical Cherenkov\ntechnique to detect neutrinos interacting in a transparent medium (water or ice) to produce\ncharged particles. IceCube, now three-quarters constructed, is already by far the most\nsensitive neutrino \"telescope.\" It has a \u223c1 km3 instrumented volume and will operate for\n\na decade after construction is complete in early 2011.\n\nWhile these general-purpose neutrino telescopes have sensitivity between 1011 and\n1018 eV and are particularly optimized for discovery in the TeV (1012 eV) to PeV (1015 eV)\nregion, a second type of astrophysical neutrino detectors has also proliferated in the past\ndecade, optimized for EeV (1018 eV) energies. This energy range is considered \"extremely\nhigh energy\" (EHE). While the neutrino-nucleon interaction rate is higher in this energy\n\n\f9\nrange, the expected flux is lower, so very large instrumented volumes are necessary. Experiments have therefore depended on creative instrumentation techniques to monitor large\nnaturally occurring volumes of matter for neutrino interactions.\nExperiments in the EeV range have relied mostly on the radio Cherenkov techniques, with additional contributions from the optical Cherenkov technique and the extensive air shower technique. Although it is not yet competitive with these techniques, the\nacoustic technique has also been used to set neutrino flux limits, and has has been developed\nsteadily over the past few years.\n\n1.1.1\n\nTheories of EHE neutrino production\nFor the past decade there have ben two outstanding questions concerning ultra-\n\nhigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR): (1) Is there a GZK cutoff? (2) What is the source of the\ncosmic rays? The first question has now been resolved by the HiRes and Auger experiments.\nThe second is still one of the most important questions in astro-particle physics. Both\nquestions are intimately connected to extremely high energy (EHE) neutrinos.\nThe most important theoretical source of astrophysical neutrinos expected in the\nEeV (EHE) range is the \"cosmogenic\" or Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) neutrinos. These\nneutrinos are produced when ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR, with energies in excess of 1019 eV) interact with the cosmic microwave background at the delta resonance,\nproducing pions and nucleons which decay to neutrinos. The interaction length for this\nprocess is \u223c50 Mpc at 1019 eV.\n\nIn addition to producing neutrinos, this interaction is predicted to suppress the\n\nultra-high-energy cosmic ray flux above \u223c1019.5 eV, an effect known as the GZK cutoff.\n\nThe UHECR spectrum is otherwise described well by a broken power law over many orders\nof magnitude. The GZK mechanism is a solid prediction of basic particle physics and\nastrophysics and has therefore been an important focus of astro-particle physics. Absence\nof a cutoff would indicate something new either in the physics or in the astrophysics of the\nprocess, and would yield insight into the source of these ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. For\nseveral years there were indications from the AGASA experiment that the cutoff did not\nexist [9], which sparked intense activity in the field and a proliferation of exotic models.\nTheories of ultra-high energy neutrinos and charged cosmic rays fall for the most\npart into two categories. \"Bottom-up\" models invoke acceleration of hadrons by astro-\n\n\f10\nphysical engines such as gamma-ray bursts (GRB's) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). The\naccelerated hadrons provide detectable cosmic ray, neutrino, and photon fluxes. \"Topdown\" models instead invoke the decay of heavy exotic particles, again producing detectable\ncharged cosmic rays, neutrinos, and photons. The energy in these models comes from the\nrest mass of the exotic particles rather than from astrophysical accelerators.\nImprovements both in understanding detector systematics and in building larger,\nredundant detectors have improved our understanding of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in\nthe past several years. Both the HiRes experiment [10] and, with larger sensitivity, the\nAuger experiment [11] have refuted the AGASA result and measured with high confidence\na steepening of the UHECR spectrum around 4 x 1019 eV. The simplest explanation of this\nsteepening is the GZK mechanism.\nThe confirmation of the GZK cutoff increases our confidence that the GZK mechanism is a \"guaranteed\" source of EHE neutrinos. Other exotic theories, currently disfavored\nboth by the confirmation of the GZK cutoff and by increasingly stringent experimental constraints on the neutrino flux, include topological defect models [12] and Z-burst models [13].\nSeveral groups have calculated the predicted GZK neutrino spectrum. A baseline\nmodel, used to estimate the expected neutrino rate of many EHE neutrino experiments, was\ncalculated by Engel, Seckel, and Stanev (ESS) in 2001 [14]. The composition of UHECR is\ndifficult to measure and is poorly known. Most GZK neutrino calculations have assumed\nthe composition is predominantly protons. If the composition is heavy (iron-like) or mixed,\nthe GZK neutrino flux is expected to be lower than that in the pure proton case, for a\nfixed UHECR spectrum [15]. This is because if the energy of a primary UHECR is shared\nby multiple nucleons, the nuclei are first photodisintegrated by background photons. The\nresulting individual nuclei can then undergo the GZK process, but they have reduced energy\nrelative to the original nucleus. The number of protons available at the delta resonance is\nlower than in the case of pure proton primaries.\n\n1.1.2\n\nExperimental EHE neutrino results to date\nThree dense media have been instrumented (or considered for future instrumen-\n\ntation) for astrophysical neutrino searches: water, ice, and salt. These particular media\nhave been considered because they occur naturally in very large volumes, as is necessary to\nachieve the instrumented volumes on the order of 1-100 km3 necessary for extremely high\n\n\f11\nenergy neutrino detection.\nThe Baikal, ANTARES, NESTOR, and NEMO projects have used lake and sea\nwater, searching for optical Cherenkov signals. The SAUND experiment has searched for\nacoustic signals in sea water, as have the ACORNE and AMADEUS projects.\nThe AMANDA and IceCube projects have searched for optical Cherenkov signals\nwith instrumented ice. The RICE, FORTE, and ANITA projects have searched for radio\nCherenkov signals originating in the polar ice caps (Greenland and Antarctica). SPATS is\nnow searching for acoustic signals in South Pole ice.\nFinally, salt occurs naturally in underground domes (diapirs, or geological intrusions) that can be several km in width and height. They have been considered for radio\nCherenkov detection of neutrino interactions by the SalSA project, and measurements of\nsite properties (particularly attenuation length) have been made at several domes. These\nsalt domes could also be used for acoustic detection of neutrinos, although they typically\nhave layered heterogeneities that could significantly scatter the acoustic signals.\nMost of these projects instrument a large volume with sparse array and then search\nfor signals \"contained\" inside the array. Exceptions to this include ANITA, which uses a\nhigh-altitude balloon to search for radio signals from the Antarctic ice sheet, and FORTE,\nwhich used a radio satellite to search for signals from the Greenland ice sheet. Continuing\nto even further remote sensing of neutrinos, the GLUE project searched for radio Cherenkov\nsignals produced by neutrinos interacting in the moon.\nIn addition to water, ice, salt, and moon rock, the atmosphere can also be used as\na target medium for neutrino detection. Neutrino-induced showers are distinguished from\nhadron (cosmic ray) showers by searching for highly inclined, slightly downgoing (nearly\nhorizontal) air showers. These showers must have traversed a large column of density of air\nbefore interacting and therefore must be weakly interacting (neutrinos or something exotic).\nIn addition to slightly down-going events, slightly-up going neutrino events can also be\ndetected with air shower experiments. This type of search requires that a tau neutrino skims\nthe Earth (nearly horizontally) and interacts inside it via the charged-current interaction\nto produce a tau lepton, which then escapes the Earth and then decays to produce an\nair shower. In addition to slightly up-going Earth-skimming searches, searches can be\nperformed for the same phenomenon occurring via conversion inside a nearby mountain\nrather than the Earth.\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory has performed both down-going and up-going searches. [16].\n\n\f12\n\nFigure 1.1:\n\nCurrent flux limits from several experimental EHE neutrino searches:\n\nAMANDA, RICE, ANITA, Auger, FORTE, and HiRes. A range of theoretical models\nfor GZK neutrino fluxes is also shown. Experiments have now excluded the more optimistic\ntheoretical models. In the next few years ANITA, Auger, and IceCube will either exclude\nthe moderate models or detect GZK neutrinos if they are correct. Figure taken from [17].\nWhile the down-going search is sensitive to both charged-current and neutral-current interactions and to all neutrino flavors, the up-going search is sensitive only to tau neutrino\ncharged-current (CC) interactions. This is because electron neutrino CC interactions produce an electron that showers before escaping the Earth, and muon neutrino CC interactions\nproduce a single muon that can escape the Earth but then traverses the atmosphere without\nproducing a significant signal detectable by an air shower array. Despite being sensitive to\nonly a single flavor and a single interaction type, the up-going search is more sensitive than\nthe down-going search due to the large density of the Earth compared to the atmosphere.\nCurrent neutrino flux limits in the 1018 eV energy range are summarized in Figure 1.1.\n\n\f13\n\nFigure 1.2: Acoustic signal production by a neutrino-induced particle shower. A highenergy neutrino interacts to produce a hadronic (or electromagnetic) cascade, which heats\na long, thin volume of the medium. This filament is on the order of 10 cm diameter and\n10 m length. The thermal energy is deposited rapidly, faster than both the thermal and\nacoustic time scales. This rapid heating causes rapid expansion, resulting in an outgoing\nshock wave. Because the filament is long and thin, the radiation pattern is a wide, flat disk\nperpendicular to the filament. The acoustic pulse expands outward from the filament in a\nring shape, illuminating a disk of the medium perpendicular to the cascade. Figure taken\nfrom [18].\n\n1.2\n\nAcoustic detection of particle showers\nWhen high-energy particles interact in dense (solid or liquid) media to produce\n\nsecondary particles that eventually deposit most of the original particle energy as heat, the\nheat expands the medium locally causing a shock wave to be emitted (Figure 1.2). This\n\"thermoacoustic\" effect, first proposed in the 1950's, can be used to detect very high energy\nastrophysical particles. It is particularly well suited for neutrinos, which pass for the most\npart through the atmosphere and interact only when traversing a denser medium.\n\n\f14\n\n1.2.1\n\nTheory and simulation\nThe theory of the thermoacoustic effect was first established in the 1950's by\n\nGurgen Askarian [19]. In the 1970's a comprehensive treatment of the effect was developed,\nincluding computer-based calculations of the acoustic pulse produced by particle showers,\nby both Askarian [20] and by John Learned [21].\nDedenko, Butkevich, et al. performed calculations of the pressure pulse produced\nby neutrino interactions in the 1990's [22]. While the rough shape of the predicted pulses\nagreed, the normalization of the pressure pulse calculated by Learned, Askaryan, and Dedenko differed by an order of magnitude. None of these early calculations included the\nLandau, Pomeranchuk, Migdal effect (see Section 2.2.1).\nWe updated the treatment of Learned (in sea water) to include the LPM effect,\nin order to calculate the neutrino sensitivity of the SAUND experiment [23], [1]. The\nsame calculation framework used for SAUND was used for our studies of hybrid arrays in\nice [5]. Niess and Bertin also calculated neutrino-induced pressure signals [24] for both\nelectromagnetic showers and for hadronic showers. They included the LPM effect in the\nelectromagnetic showers but not in the hadronic showers.\nMost recently, the ACORNE group has done a careful study [2], simulating hadronic\nshowers by adopting the CORSIKA\n\n1\n\nair shower simulation package to work in water and\n\nice (including the LPM effect). They found that the radial distribution of energy deposition in the showers is peaked at smaller radii than for previous calculations, indicating that\nthe signal content of neutrino-induced acoustic pulses is peaked at higher frequencies than\npreviously calculated. Calculations by the three most recent groups ([1], [24], and [2] all\nagree within a factor of two in pressure amplitude).\n\n1.2.2\n\nExperiments in the laboratory\nThe calculations done by Learned were verified in the laboratory by Sulak et\n\nal. [25] using a proton beam at Brookhaven National Laboratory. This pioneering work\nverified many aspects of the thermoacoustic mechanism, and constrained contributions from\nother mechanisms (microbubble implosion and molecular dissociation) to be small. Several\naspects of the thermoacoustic mechanism were verified quantitatiely:\n1\n\nhttp://www-ik.fzk.de/corsika\n\n\f15\n1. The frequency of the acoustic signal was inversely proportional to the beam diameter\nc, and roughly equal to\n\nc\n2d\n\nwhere c is the sound speed.\n\n2. The acoustic pressure amplitude increased linearly with the deposited shower energy.\n3. The acoustic pressure amplitude scaled as 1/d2 , i.e. proportional to the the shower\nenergy deposition density for fixed total shower energy deposition.\n4. In tests comparing several different fluid target media, the acoustic pressure amplitude\nscaled with \u03b2/CP as expected, where \u03b2 is the thermal expansivity and CP is the\nspecific heat capacity, over more than an order of magnitude in \u03b2/CP .\n5. In water, \u03b2 increases with temperature and is negative for temperatures between 0 and\n4 \u25e6 C. As expected, the acoustic signal amplitude increased with temperature and was\ninverted in polarity for temperatures near 0, crossing zero amplitude at a few degrees.\nHowever, the exact zero-crossing temperature was 6 \u25e6 C. This offset could indicate a\nsmall contribution from a secondary mechanism other than the thermoacoustic effect.\nOthers (such as [26] and [27]) have followed up on Sulak's work to further characterize the thermoacoustic effect using proton beams dumped in water.\nThe thermoacoustic effect was first demonstrated in ice using a proton beam at\nthe University of Uppsala [28]. Work is underway to experimentally verify the quantitative\nproperties of the effect with a laser-induced signal in a large bubble-free block of ice at\nRWTH Aachen University [29].\n\n1.2.3\n\nExperiments in the field\nThe DUMAND group did pioneering work on neutrino astronomy in ocean water\n\nin the 1970's and 1980's, mostly focused on the optical Cherenkov method but also including\nthe acoustic method. In the last decade, the idea of acoustic neutrino detection has been\ntaken up again and tested by several groups at several sites. Recent summaries of this\nactivity include [30] and [31].\nOur group at Stanford was the first of these. We read out an array of seven\nunderwater microphones (hydrophones) on the sea floor in the Tongue of the Oceans, a\ndeep (\u223c1.5 km) ocean cul-de-sac in the Bahamas. The array is the Atlantic Undersea Test\nand Evaluation Center (AUTEC), operated by the U. S. Navy. Through an agreement\n\n\f16\nwith the Navy, our group operated the Study of Acoustic Underwater Neutrino Detection\n(SAUND) using the AUTEC hydrophones. We installed a simple single-PC DAQ system to\nread out the seven hydrophones and searched for neutrino-induced signals with the array.\nThe sensitivity of the array was first estimated in [23], and we presented the final analysis of\nthe data, including the first neutrino flux limit produced with the acoustic method, in [1].\nWe have now switched to a larger, upgraded array of 49 hydrophones and upgraded the DAQ\nsystem. This is the SAUND-II project. Data analysis is underway. One interesting spin-off\nresult from the SAUND-II project is that the data were used to verify for the first time [4]\na general model of underwater noise produced by surface wind acting on the surface [32].\nThe ANTARES (Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental\nRESearch) optical Cherenkov neutrino array, located in the Mediterranean sea, also has\nan active acoustic neutrino detection research and development program, Antares Modules\nfor Acoustic DEtection Under the Sea (AMADEUS). AMADEUS consists of six clusters\nof six acoustic sensors each. Within each cluster the sensors are arranged \u223c m from one\nanother. The distances between the clusters range from 15 m to more than 200 m [33].\n\nThe group has developed new source reconstruction techniques and applied them to the\nANTARES data [18], and has also characterized the noise environment and related it to\nwind patterns [33].\nA group in the United Kingdom (Acoustic COsmic Ray Neutrino Experiment,\nACORNE), has installed a data acquisition system at a military hydrophone array in Scotland. The group has acquired a large data set and searched it for acoustic neutrino signals [3]. They have also performed hydrophone array sensitivity studies [34], studied the\nproperties of hadronic shower deposition relevant to acoustic neutrino signal production [2],\nand developed new mathematical methods for simulating the acoustic signal induced by\nthermal energy deposition [35].\nAssociated with the NEMO (NEutrino Mediterranean Observatory) optical Cherenkov\nneutrino telescope project, the O\u03bdDE (Ocean noise Detection Experiment) project is also\nstudying acoustic neutrino detection in the Mediterranean Sea. The detector is located\n25 km off the shore of Sicily at 2 m depth. It consists of four hydrophones, whose data are\nbeing used to characterize the noise environment and to study cetacean (sperm whale, in\nparticular) activity. [36].\n\n\f17\n\nChapter 2\n\nSimulation of neutrino-induced\nsignals and detector sensitivity\nIn this chapter we give an overview of the physics of hadronic showers and introduce a\nnew parameterization of them, modified from a standard parameterization to include the\nLPM effect. We then describe the software package that has been developed to simulate\nthe acoustic signal as a function of sensor location, neutrino energy, and detector medium\nproperties, and give results for the acoustic radiation pattern calculated in various media\nas a function of neutrino energy. Finally we describe another software package that has\nbeen developed to determine the response (effective volume) of acoustic detector arrays as a\nfunction of neutrino energy. We conclude with some notes on neutrino event reconstruction\nwith acoustic signals.\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter we describe several levels of simulation that we have performed.\n\nFirst we describe a parameterization of hadronic shower energy deposition, which is necessary to determine the acoustic pulse produced by the hadronic shower. Next we describe\nsimulations of the acoustic pressure pulse as a function of time for arbitrary positions with\nrespect to the neutrino-induced shower location and orientation, for neutrinos of arbitrary\nenergy interacting in arbitrary media. We then apply this simulation in particular to water,\nice, and salt.\nNext we developed a package to simulate detector responses and neutrino flux sen-\n\n\f18\nsitivities for acoustic detector arrays intended to detect neutrino-induced acoustic pulses.\nWe developed a flexible framework to do this for arbitrary array designs in arbitrary media\nand have applied it to several example arrays. In particular (assuming the acoustic properties of South Pole ice expected from theoretical predictions, which are different from those\nwe have now measured) we determined that a large hybrid optical/radio/acoustic array\ncentered on the IceCube array could detect \u223c20 GZK events per year, with about half of\n\nthem detected by more than one method simultaneously.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nShower properties\nLandau, Pomeranchuk, Migdal (LPM) effect\nIn order to determine the acoustic signal induced by a particle shower, it is nec-\n\nessary to know the spatial distribution of thermal energy deposited by a particle shower in\na dense (solid or liquid) medium. The spatial distribution of the energy is as important as\nthe total energy deposited, and this distribution determines the frequency spectrum of the\nacoustic signal as well as its radiation pattern. We consider hadronic showers only. This is\nbecause electromagnetic showers are elongated dramatically by the Landau, Pomeranchuk,\nMigdal (LPM) effect, sufficiently to reduce the deposited energy density and therefore the\namplitude of the acoustic pulse.\nThe LPM effect is the following: ultra-high-energy interactions involve small transverse momentum transfer, occurring over a long time. The interaction time is long enough\nfor multiple scattering to occur. This reduces the cross section of both bremsstrahlung and\npair production interactions, effectively lengthening particle showers. The effect is large for\nelectromagnetic showers. It is small but finite for hadronic showers, and occurs via \u03c0 0 's in\nsub-showers of the hadronic shower. See [37] for a review of the LPM effect.\nThe development of hadronic showers in solids and liquids is essentially the same\nas the development of hadronics showers in air, where they have been studied extensively\nby extensive air shower (EAS) arrays. If column density (g/cm2 ) is used instead of distance,\nthe same treatment of hadronic showers can be used for air and for solids and liquids.\n\n\f19\n\n2.2.2\n\nMoli\u00e8re radius\nThe Moli\u00e8re radius, r1 , is the radius of a cylinder containing on average 90% of\n\nthe energy deposited in an electromagnetic shower initiated by an electron or photon [38].\n\n2.2.3\n\nRadiation length\nThe radiation length, Xrad , is the mean distance over which an electron's energy\n\nis reduced by one e-folding due to bremsstrahlung. The radiation length is also 7/9 of the\nmean free path for pair production by a photon with sufficient energy for pair production.\nSee [38] for more details.\n\n2.2.4\n\nShower \"age\"\nShowers of higher energy are longer and reach their maximum at greater depth in\n\nthe medium than showers of lower energy. The \"age\" parameter s is a standard quantity\nintroduced to quantify the longitudinal distance along a shower relative to its maximum\n(and therefore independent of energy), rather than relative to absolute distance in the\nmedium. The age is zero at the first shower interaction point, one at shower maximum, and\ntwo at the end of the shower (the point when the number of shower particles is less than\none). The age parameter was introduced for electromagnetic showers but can also be used\nfor hadronic showers. [39]\n\n2.3\n\nParameterization of hadronic showers\nWe use the hadronic shower parameterization (both longitudinal and radial) de-\n\nveloped for the SAUND project and described in [23, 1]. The parameterization accounts for\nelongation due to the LPM effect. Here are the full details of the parameterization, which\nwas developed by Nikolai Lehtinen for the SAUND project.\nThe hadronic shower parameterization we use is the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen\n(NKG) parameterization (presented e.g. in [39]), with the following features:\n1. We normalize to the total shower energy (rather than total number of particles).\n2. We use energy-dependent tail length and maximum shower depth parameterized from\nsimulations that include the LPM effect for hadronic showers [40].\n\n\f20\nAs presented in [39], the particle density in a hadronic shower as a function of\ndepth X and radius r can be approximated by the NKG parameterization,\nD(X, r) = N (x)\u03c1(r),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere we have decomposed the distribution into two independent functions, one\ngiving the longitudinal distribution and one giving the radial distribution. The two distributions are defined as follows (following the treatment of [39]):\n\nN (X) = Nmax\n\n\u0012\n\nX \u2212 X0\nXmax \u2212 X0\n\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u0013 Xmax \u2212X0\n\u03bb\n\ne\n\nXmax \u2212X\n\u03bb\n\n;\n\nN0\nf (s, r/r1 ),\nr12\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere\nf (s, r/r1 ) = (\n\n\u0393(4.5 \u2212 s)\nr\nr s\u22122\n) (1 + )s\u22124.5\n.\nr1\nr1\n2\u03c0\u0393(s)\u0393(4.5 \u2212 2s)\n\n(2.4)\n\nHere X0 is the interaction depth, Nmax is the maximum particle density, Xmax\nis the depth at which it occurs, \u03bb = 70 g/cm2 is the tail length, r1 is the Moli\u00e8re radius,\nand s is the shower age. This lateral distribution function is an analytical solution for\nelectromagnetic showers, developed by Kamata and Nishimura [41]. By choosing a constant\nvalue s = 1.25 (the effective age parameter), this function has been found experimentally\nto describe the average hadronic shower well. Choosing a coordinate system where X0 = 0\n(such that X is the longitudinal distance forward from the interaction point), and defining\nt = Xmax /\u03bb,\nN (X) = Nmax (\n\nX t t\u2212X/\u03bb\n)e\n.\nXmax\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe wish to renormalize such that the volume integral over the distribution is not\nthe total number of particles but is unity:\nZ\n\nD(X, r)2\u03c0rdrdX = 1.\n\n(2.6)\n\n\f21\nThen we can multiply by either total number of particles (or total shower energy) to get\nthe particle density (or energy density). The radial part is already normalized,\nZ\n\n\u03c1(r)2\u03c0rdr = 1,\n\n(2.7)\n\nif we choose\nN0 = 1.\n\n(2.8)\n\nSo it remains to normalize\nZ\n\nN (X)dX = 1.\n\n(2.9)\n\ntt\u22121\n.\net \u03bb\u0393(t)\n\n(2.10)\n\nThis is achieved by choosing\nNmax =\n\nResults from simulating hadronic showers including the LPM effect are presented in [40], for\nshower energies Esh = 104 , 106 , and 108 GeV. For reference we reproduce Figure 2 of [40]\nhere as Figure 2.1(a). We parameterize their results as follows:\nXmax = 0.9Xrad ln\n\n\u03bb=\n\nEsh\n;\nEcrit\n\nEsh\n1\n(130 \u2212 5 log 4\n) m.\n100\n10 GeV\n\n(2.11)\n\n(2.12)\n\nTo verify this parameterization, we can compare it directly to Figure 2.1(a). First we\nnormalize to total number of particles (rather than to unity as given by Equation 2.10) by\nobserving from Figure 2.1(a) that\nlog[Nmax ] \u2248 log[\n\nEsh\n] \u2212 0.2.\nGeV\n\n(2.13)\n\nSee Figure 2.1(b) for our parameterization with this normalization, to be compared with\nFigure 2.1(a).\nFigure 2.2 gives the the longitudinal distribution for a wider range of energies.\nFigures 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 give the radial distributions at 104 , 107 , and 1010 GeV.

N. Lehtinen, J. Vandenbroucke,\nand N. Kurahashi wrote a computer program to do this calculation. The program integrates\nover the energy deposition, including the contribution of each element of each spatial element\nto the acoustic signal, using a Green's function method. The program was described in [23]\nand [1].\nSeveral energy distributions are supported, including those for a spherical Gaussian, an electromagnetic shower (including the LPM effect), a hadronic shower, and an\nelectromagnetic discharge (such as that produced by a \"zapper\" calibration device developed for the SAUND project). The material properties can be specified and in particular\nsea water, South Pole ice, and salt dome media are supported.\nEach execution of the program calculates the pressure pulse at a grid of points,\n\n\f26\nTable 2.1: Material properties used in the simulation of neutrino-induced pressure pulses\nin sea water, South Pole ice, and salt.\nProperty\n\nSymbol (Units)\n\nSea water\n\nSouth Pole ice\n\nSalt\n\nTemperature\n\nT (\u25e6 C)\n\n15\n\n-51\n\n30\n\nSound speed\n\nvL (m/s)\n\n1530\n\n3920\n\n4560\n\nVolume expansivity\n\n\u03b2 (10\u22125 K\u22121 )\n\n25.5\n\n12.5\n\n11.6\n\nHeat capacity\n\nCP (J/kg/K)\n\n3900\n\n1720\n\n839\n\nPeak frequency\n\nfp (kHz)\n\n7.7\n\n20\n\n42\n\n0.153\n\n1.12\n\n2.87\n\nGruneisen parameter\n\n\u03b3=\n\nvL2 \u03b2/CP\n\nRadiation length\n\nXrad (m)\n\n0.361\n\n0.392\n\n0.0997\n\nMoli\u00e8re radius\n\nrM (m)\n\n0.0730\n\n0.0794\n\n0.0417\n\nCritical energy\n\nEcrit (GeV)\n\n0.0870\n\n0.0870\n\n0.0440\n\nsuch that a radiation pattern contour can be determined with a single program execution.\nExecution times are on the order of one pressure pulse (one point in the grid) per minute.\nThe material properties that we are using are given in Table 2.1. See [30] for\nfurther comparison of the three media.\n\n2.4.2\n\nAcoustic radiation pattern in water, ice, and salt\nWe used the software described above to calculate the acoustic radiation pattern\n\nfor neutrinos of various energies in each of the media. The software allows the user to choose\na medium, a medium attenuation model, a signal processing method (raw or matched filter),\nand a threshold. We assume that each neutrino of energy E\u03bd generates a hadronic shower\nof energy Ehad = yE\u03bd , where y = 0.2 for every interaction. We give radiation patterns\nfor multiple energies at a single threshold. The contours can be rescaled to determine the\nradiation pattern at other thresholds. For example, the contour for a 1018 eV neutrino with\na 10 mPa threshold is equivalent to the contour for a 1019 eV neutrino with a 100 mPa\nthreshold. In other words, the neutrino energy threshold scales linearly with the ambient\nnoise level. This follows from the linear dependence of the acoustic pressure amplitude on\nthe hadronic shower energy.\nAcoustic radiation contours for neutrino-induced signals in sea water are shown in\n\n\f27\n\nSea water: E\u03bd = 1022, 1023, 1024, 1025 eV\n\nDistance along shower (m)\n\n500\n\n0\n\n\u2212500\n0\n\n2\n4\n6\nDistance along pancake (m)\n\n8\n4\n\nx 10\n\nFigure 2.6: Acoustic radiation pattern induced by a neutrino interacting in sea water, for\nvarious neutrino energies.

The neutrino\ninteracts at a lateral coordinate of zero and a longitudinal coordinate of +9 m (offset from\nzero in order that the shower max and acoustic radiation pattern are centered close to a\nlongitudinal coordinate of zero).\n\n2.5\n\nA large hybrid optical/radio/acoustic extension of IceCube\nWe simulated a large hybrid optical/radio/acoustic extension of IceCube for GZK\n\nneutrino detection. The encouraging results of this simulation motivated us to develop\nSPATS, in order to measure the acoustic properties of the ice and gain technical experience\ntoward a larger detector array. The simulations indicated that we could detect \u223c10-20\n\n\f29\nGZK neutrinos per year, half of which were detected with both the radio and the acoustic\nmethod. The results of this simulation were presented in [5], which is included here as\nAppendix A.\nNote that these simulations used the theoretical estimates of acoustic attenuation\nin South Pole ice available at the time [8]. Our new experimental measurement of the\nattenuation (Chapter 8) shows that the true amount of attenuation is \u223c30 times larger\nthan the theoretical prediction used in the simulations.\n\n2.6\n\nAn intermediate-scale hybrid extension of IceCube\nFollowing the large hybrid detector simulation, we also simulated an intermediate\n\nhybrid detector which could be used to see a few GZK events and test the technology for\nthe large array. The results of this simulation are presented in [42].\n\n2.7\n2.7.1\n\nAcoustic and hybrid event reconstruction\nNeutrino event reconstruction with only three hit sensors\nAs described in Chapter 7, four or five hit receivers are generally necessary to\n\nreconstruct the location of a source. Such algorithms will be necessary to reconstruct most\nevents including background events which are expected to have roughly isotropic emission\npatterns for the most part.\nHowever, in the case of neutrino event reconstruction, three hits on three strings\nis actually sufficient for good reconstruction if there are no noise hits: a plane fit through\nthe hit sensors determines the plane of the very flat acoustic radiation \"pancake\". The\nupward normal to the fitted plane then gives the neutrino direction with \u223c1\u25e6 precision. If\n\nthe signal is really neutrino induced, the mirror symmetry about the fitted plane is broken\n\nby the fact that upgoing neutrinos in this high energy range are absorbed by the Earth, so\nonly downgoing neutrinos are detectable. Therefore the upward normal to the fitted plane\npoints to the direction from which the neutrino came.\nThree hits on three strings is sufficient for neutrino direction determination with\nthis method. Vertex position and energy can also be determined in many cases, even with\nonly three hits, as follows. A change of coordinates to the pancake plane means two hits\nconstrain the vertex to a hyperbola (not hyperboloid; it's a 2D problem now) and the third\n\n\f30\nhit identifies one or two points on the first hyperbola. In some cases a 4th hit is necessary\nto distinguish between two solutions to the intersection of two hyperbola. But in many\ncases with three hits, one of the two solutions is unphysical so three hits are sufficient to\ndetermine neutrino direction as well as vertex position and shower energy.\nThis assumes there are no noise hits and that the three hits are already identified to\nbe neutrino-induced. Including 4 or more hits (with amplitude information) will usually be\nnecessary to give some indication of the radiation pattern and thereby distinguish neutrino\nsignals from background transients.\n\n2.7.2\n\nEvent reconstruction with shear waves\nIn contrast to both radio and optical signals, two types of body waves are possible\n\nfor acoustic waves in solids: pressure (longitudinal) and shear (transverse) waves. There\nare also a variety of surface acoustic waves possible in solids, including Rayleigh waves.\nIn liquids, only longitudinal acoustic waves are supported. But in a solid such as ice, a\nsingle acoustic emission event can produce both pressure (P) and shear (S) waves. The S\nwave propagates at roughly half the speed of the P wave in many solid media including ice\n(see our experimental measurement of P and S wave speeds in South Pole ice, presented\nin Chapter 5). We have detected both P and S waves from both types of our emitters\n(frozen-in transmitters operated in ice, and retrievable pinger operated in water), as well\nas from ambient transient events. The detection of shear waves from the source surrounded\nby water in particular was a surprise and is discussed in Section 7.1.\nIt is possible that neutrinos produce shear waves in addition to pressure waves.\nWhile the pressure wave production has been verified and characterized in the laboratory by\nSulak et al. [25] as described in Chapter 1, little is known about shear wave production by the\nthermoacoustic effect. It has been argued on theoretical grounds [43] that thermoacoustic\nshear wave production should be suppressed. However, more laboratory work is necessary\nto resolve this question.\nIf particle showers do produce S waves as well as P waves, the S waves could contribute valuable information to the event reconstruction and background rejection potential\nof a detector array. The distance to an acoustic source can be resolved with a single module\nthat detects both a P and an S wave. If the acoustic emission is known to be isotropic,\nthe energy of the event can then be determined from a single module. In the case of\n\n\f31\npancake-shaped thermoacoustic radiation, more modules are likely necessary to determine\nthe shower energy, although the sharpness of the radiation pattern could be quantified in a\nbeaming factor and used to determine an order-of-magnitude estimate of the shower energy\ndespite the severely anisotropic radiation pattern. More generally, if P waves are detected\non one or more modules, detection of additional S wave hits on one or more modules can\nbe used to improve event reconstruction or reduce the number of hit modules necessary.\nOn the other hand, if particle showers are conclusively shown to not produce\nshear waves, the presence of shear waves in detected events could be a valuable handle for\ndistinguishing background signals from neutrino-induced signals. We have already shown\nwith SPATS that shear waves are present for at least one class of transient background\nevents (see Chapter 7).\n\n2.7.3\n\nHybrid reconstruction\nIf a future hybrid detector array detects signals from more than one of the possible\n\n(optical, radio, acoustic) methods, the information can be combined for improved event\nreconstruction. The challenge is that the signals propagate with speeds that differ by five\norders of magnitude. For example, the time for a radio signal to propagate \u223c1 km from\na source to a receiver is much smaller than the time for an acoustic signal to propagate\n\nthe same distance, and is in fact comparable to the time between individual samples in the\nacoustic signal. The na\u0131\u0308ve conclusion is that the uncertainty in the acoustic signal arrival\ntime is so large that it is impossible to combine the hits on the same footing with radio and\noptical hits, whose arrival time is determined much more precisely.\nNevertheless, the hit receiver information from the different methods can be put\non the same footing, such that any hit on any receiver is as valuable as any other regardless\nof the signal type, by expressing the propagation equations in terms of distances rather than\ntimes. The arrival times (and uncertainties of the arrival times) are simply scaled by the\npropagation speed. When this is done, the uncertainty due to time-of-arrival resolution for\nthe different methods is comparable. The method was described and demonstrated with a\nMonte Carlo simulation in [44].\n\n\f32\n\nChapter 3\n\nDesign of the South Pole Acoustic\nTest Setup\nIn this chapter we give an overview of the development of SPATS and describe the array\ngeometry and system design. We give details about the design of individual components\nof SPATS and of the retrievable pinger that was developed and operated with SPATS. For\nreference we include the surface layout of both the SPATS strings and the holes in which\nthe pinger was operated.\n\n3.1\n\nTimeline\nFollowing previous work on neutrino detector array simulation, sensor design, and\n\nlaboratory tests, we conceived and designed the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS)\nin 2005. Construction, integration, and testing proceeded through 2006. SPATS was initially conceived as three strings of acoustic sensors and transmitters, which were installed in\nthree IceCube holes in January 2007. Based on analysis of data from the first few months of\nSPATS in the three-string configuration, we decided to add a fourth string (with improvements in module design and layout relative to the first three strings). The fourth string\nwas constructed and tested in the remainder of 2007 and installed in December 2007. In\nthe same year (2007) we built a retrievable pinger, which we operated for the first time in\nDecember 2007 and January 2008. Analysis of that data led to a significantly improved\npinger, which we operated operated in December 2008 and January 2009.\n\n\f33\nTable 3.1: Tabulation of which instrumentation is at which depth in each of the four\nSPATS strings. \"HADES\" are the sensors of an alternative design. \"L emitter\" is an\nalternative type of emitter (produced by the Lausanne group), connected to the same type\nof transmitter module (HV pulser) as other transmitters.\nDepth (m)\n\nStrings A, B, and C\n\nString D\n\n80\n\nStage 1\n\n-\n\n100\n\nStage 2\n\n-\n\n140\n\nStage 3\n\nStage 1\n\n190\n\nStage 4\n\nStage 2 (inc.

Each string has seven acoustic stages, with each stage\nconsisting of one transmitter module and one sensor module. Strings A, B, and C were deployed in January 2007 and contain stages at depth 80, 100, 140, 190, 250, 320, and 400 m.\nString D was deployed in December 2007 and contains stages at depth 140, 190, 250, 320,\n400, 430, and 500 m. The instrumentation at each depth is summarized in Table 3.1. The\nhorizontal distances between strings are given in Table 3.2.\n\n3.3\n\nSystem overview\nA schematic of the SPATS array is given in Figure 3.2. Each of the SPATS strings\n\nwas deployed in an IceCube hole, alongside the IceCube string, after the IceCube string\nwas deployed and anchored. Each of the strings consists of seven acoustic \"stages\" each at\na different depth. Each stage consists of a transmitter module and a sensor module.\nThe transmitters and sensors are connected to the surface via analog signals along\n\n\f34\n\n600\nD (76)\n\nA (78)\nB (72)\n\n400\n\ny (m)\n\n200\n\nC (47)\n\n0\n\u2212200\n\u2212400\n\u2212600\n\u2212600\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n\n0\nx (m)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nFigure 3.1: Surface layout of the 59 IceCube strings deployed by the end of January 2009.\nThe four holes with SPATS strings are labeled by SPATS string ID (letter) and IceCube\nstring ID (number).\n\nTable 3.2: Horizontal distances between SPATS strings.\nBaseline\n\nDistance (m)\n\nAB\n\n124.8\n\nAC\n\n421.1\n\nAD\n\n249.2\n\nBC\n\n302.2\n\nBD\n\n330.3\n\nCD\n\n543.0\n\n\f35\n\nFigure 3.2: Schematic of the SPATS system design.\ncopper wires. At the surface of each string is an Acoustic Junction Box (AJB) inside\nof which is a waterproof compartment where the in-ice lines are connected to a rugged\nembedded computer (String PC). The four String PC's are connected to a central Master\nPC, a rack-mounted server indoors in the IceCube Laboratory. Power, communications,\nand timing are routed over surface cables from the Master PC to each of the String PC's.\nThe design of the SPATS system, and results from initial tests of SPATS hardware\nin the laboratory and in the field are described in detail in [43].\n\n\f36\n\n3.4\n\nIn-ice transmitters\nSPATS includes 28 transmitter modules (seven per string) frozen into the ice be-\n\ntween 80 m and 500 m depth. Each module consists of a ring-shaped piezoelectric ceramic\nemitter and a high-voltage (HV) pulser module. The emitter is in direct contact with the\nice. It is molded in epoxy for electrical insulation and is connected to the HV pulser via a\nshort, stiff HV cable. The emitter hangs directly beneath the HV module. The HV module\nfeatures a cylindrical steel pressure housing containing the HV pulser circuit. The housing\nis penetrated on the bottom by the HV cable going to the emitter, and on the top by an\n8-pin connector that mates to the cable going to the surface.\nThe 8 pins of the transmitter are described in Table 3.3. The transmitter receives\nboth +15 V and +12 V DC from the surface, as well as a steering voltage and a trigger\nsignal. The trigger is a digital signal. The rising edge of the trigger signal initiates charging\nof an LC circuit, and the falling edge discharges it to generate an HV (\u223ckV) pulse which\nis routed to the emitter. The width of the trigger pulse determines the charge time, which\ninfluences the strength of the HV pulse and therefore of the acoustic pulse. The amplitude\ncan also be determined by a DC \"steering voltage\". A periodic trigger signal can be used\nto pulse the transmitter repeatedly.\nEach of the transmitter modules also features a temperature or pressure sensor.\nThe transmitter of the deepest stage (Stage 7) of each string has a pressure sensor built\ninto a small port penetrating the pressure housing. This was used to verify the depth of the\nstring during deployment, determine the final installed depth of the string, and monitor the\nfreeze-in process. The other six stages of each string (Stages 1-6) have no pressure sensor\nand instead have a temperature sensor. The temperature sensors were used to monitor the\nfreeze-in process. Both the pressure and temperature sensors are \"PT1000\" devices that\noutput a current in the 4-20 mPa range.\nA down-scaled version of the HV pulse that is routed down to the emitter is routed\nup to the surface along a dedicated wire. The signal is digitized at the surface. The shape\nand amplitude of the pulse can both be determined with good fidelity. This is known as\nthe \"HV read-back\" signal and is valuable for verifying transmitter performance as well for\ntime-stamping the emission time of each transmitter pulse.\n\n\f37\nTable 3.3: Pinout of the SPATS transmitters.\nPin\n\nName\n\nFunction\n\n1\n\n+15 V\n\nDC power for transmitter\n\n2\n\nGND\n\nground for DC power\n\n3\n\nTRG\n\ntrigger signal\n\n4\n\nIret\n\nreturn (output) current from pressure/temperature sensor\n\n5\n\n+12 V\n\npower for pressure/temperature sensor (also necessary for HVRB)\n\n6\n\nVsteer\n\nsteering voltage, to control transmitter amplitude\n\n7\n\nHVRB\n\ndown-scaled version of the HV pulse routed to the emitter\n\n8\n\nHVRB GND\n\nground for the HVRB signal\nTable 3.4: Pinout of the SPATS sensors.\n\n3.5\n3.5.1\n\nPin\n\nName\n\nFunction\n\n1\n\n+15 V\n\nDC power for sensor\n\n2\n\nGND\n\nground for DC power\n\n3\n\nCH1- (A-)\n\nNegative side of Channel 1 differential output\n\n4\n\nCH1+ (A+)\n\nPostive side of Channel 1 differential output\n\n5\n\nCH2- (B-)\n\nNegative side of Channel 2 differential output\n\n6\n\nCH2+ (B+)\n\nPositive side of Channel 2 differential output\n\n7\n\nCH3- (C-)\n\nNegative side of Channel 3 differential output\n\n8\n\nCH3+ (C+)\n\nPositive side of Channel 3 differential output\n\nIn-ice sensors\n\"SPATS\" sensor design: First generation (Strings A, B, and C)\nEach of the first three strings features a sensor module in each stage. Each sensor\n\nmodule consists of cylindrical steel pressure vessel housing three disk-shaped piezoelectric\nceramic transducers. The pressure cylinder is oriented with its axis vertical on the deployed\nstrings. The three transducers are in the equatorial plane of the module and are separated\nby 120\u25e6 from one another to achieve good angular coverage by the module as a whole. Each\ntransducer is pressed against the inner surface of the pressure housing with a post and the\n\n\f38\ncontact force is adjusted with a screw. Each transducer along with its amplifier constitutes\na single sensor \"channel\".\nThe three channels of each module act independently, each with its own dedicated\nwires running to the surface. The pinout of the SPATS sensor modules is shown in Table 3.4.\nAcoustic signals hit the outside of the pressure module and propagate along it. For signals\nrecorded by more than one channel, the \u223c10 cm separation between channels results in\n\nresolvable time delays in the recorded signals, which can be used to determine the azimuthal\n\ndirection to the source. Alternatively if the source direction is known, the time delay can\nbe used to determine the orientation of the sensor module.\n\n3.5.2\n\n\"SPATS\" sensor design: Second generation (String D)\nBased on experience with the first three strings, the design of the sensors was\n\nimproved for String D. The coupling of the three transducers to the steel housing is equalized\nbetter, and the electronic design was also improved. Recordings with String D sensors have\na signal-to-noise ratio that is superior to that of the first three strings.\n\n3.5.3\n\n\"HADES\" design\nIn addition to five modules of the improved sensor design, two modules of an\n\nalternative design were included in String D. The alternative design is known as \"HADES\"\nand is described in detail in [45]. In contrast to the standard design, these sensors feature\na single piezoelectric transducer (rather than three independent transducers), molded in\nepoxy and in direct contact with the ice. The epoxy material was chosen to have acoustic\nimpedance intermediate between ice and the piezoelectric, to facilitate coupling and reduce\nresonance. The signal from the transducer is routed to amplifier electronics inside a steel\npressure housing of the same type used for other SPATS sensor modules, from where the\nsignal is routed to the surface in the same way as for the other sensors. The locations\nof standard SPATS vs. HADES sensors on String D are listed in Table 3.1. In HADES\nmodules, the single sensor is connected to channel 2, and channels 0 and 1 are not connected.\nThe SPATS and HADES designs are complementary, a feature which has been\nvaluable for several analyses. Relative to the standard SPATS sensor design, the HADES\ndesign features a flatter frequency response, a lower noise level, and a lower overall sensitivity.\n\n\f39\n\n3.6\n3.6.1\n\nCables\nIn-ice cables\nThe stages are connected to the surface both mechanically and electrically by a\n\ncable bundle. The bundle includes 14 cables each of the same design. Each of the 14\ncables runs from the surface to one transmitter or sensor module, such that the bundle\nthickness decreases with increasing depth. Each cable is sufficiently strong to bear the load\nof its module individually. The individual cables are not molded together but are wrapped\ntogether with a spiral of string. Each cable in the bundle consists of 8 copper wires along\nwith insulation, filler, and sheath.\n\n3.6.2\n\nSurface cables\nThe IceCube experiment features surface cables trenched \u223c1 m beneath the snow\n\nsurface. There is one surface cable for each IceCube string, running from the string to the\nIceCube Laboratory (located in the center of the array) through a network of such trenches.\nEach cable consists of an assembly of \"quads\", each quad containing four copper wires (two\npairs). We use two of these quads for each SPATS string. One wire pair in each of our two\nquads carries DC power at +48 V. The third pair is used for a DSL communications signal,\nand the fourth pair is used for an IRIG-B GPS timing signal.\n\n3.7\n\nSurface hardware\nIn addition to the hardware buried deep in the ice, surface hardware is necessary\n\nto control and read out the in-ice instrumentation. We described the design of the SPATS\ndata acquisition system (DAQ) in an article in Embedded Computing Design magazine [46].\n\n3.7.1\n\nMaster PC\nA central \"Master PC\" is installed in the IceCube Laboratory, in the center of\n\nthe IceCube array and several hundred meters across the ice surface from SPATS. This\nserver communicates with the computers installed at the surface of each SPATS string (the\n\"String PC's\"). The Master PC features a single GPS clock (which is connected to a GPS\nantenna on the roof of the ICL), as well as a SPATS Hub Service Board for each of the four\n\n\f40\nString PC's. Users can log on to the Master PC, and from there to each of the String PC's,\nto take data manually or to apply DAQ software upgrades. Standard data taking occurs\nautonomously. The Master PC is running a standard Linux operating system.\n\n3.7.2\n\nSPATS Hub Service Board (SHSB)\nThe Master PC includes one SHSB for each String PC. The SHSB is a custom\n\nPCI board, designed by Kalle Sulanke at DESY Zeuthen. The two surface cables arriving\nfrom each from each String PC connect to the SHSB. A driver written for the SHSB allows\nthe software commands on the Master PC to power each of the strings on/off, to monitor\nthe DSL communications and and IRIG timing signal to each string, and to monitor the\nvoltage and current of each of the power lines going to the strings.\n\n3.7.3\n\nAcoustic Junction Boxes (AJB's)\nNear each IceCube hole is a \u223c2 m deep, \u223c4 m thick, and \u223c10 m long trench that\n\nis dug for IceTop tanks and filled at the end of each construction season. In addition to the\nIceTop tanks, there is a Surface Junction Box (SJB) where in-ice IceCube cables are mated\nto surface IceCube cables.\nFor the four SPATS strings, there is in addition an Acoustic Junction Box (AJB)\nlocated in this trench. The in-ice SPATS cable bundle runs to this junction box. The AJB\ncontains DC-DC converters, a DSL modem, and a String PC. A printed circuit board (PCB)\ninside each AJB routes the signals between the cables entering the AJB and the devices\ninside the AJB.\n\n3.7.4\n\nString PC's\nInsisde of each AJB is a String PC. This is a rugged embedded computer following\n\nthe PC104 design (an industry standard for embedded computing). The PC104 standard\nis a modular design allowing individual cards each serving a different purpose (e.g. CPU,\nADC, DAC, GPS, or power supply) to be stacked together. The boards communicate with\none another via ISA (AT) and/or PCI buses that run vertically through the cards in the\nstack.\nOur String PC is composed of modules produced by the Real Time Devices (RTD\nEmbedded Technologies, Inc.) company. Each string PC consits of 6 modules in a rugged\n\n\f41\naluminum enclosure to provide heat sinking, grounding, and additional protection inside the\nAJB. The enclosure includes heat sinking fins for the CPU module, is splashproof, and has\na lid on the top module such that the entire PC104 stack is enclosed (except for connectors\nin the IDAN enclosure that allow cables to be connected to the outside of the enclosure).\nWe chose the \"extended range\" (ER) modules, which are rated for temperatures\nbetween -40 \u25e6 C and +85 \u25e6 . Here are the modules comprising each String PC\nCPU module\nThere is one CPU module per String PC (RTD model IDAN-CML47786HX650ER256D/D1GX). This module features a 650 MHZ Celeron CPU board with 256 MB of memory. The board also includes a 1 GB DiskOnChip flash disk module mounted directly on the\nboard. This module was intended to be used as the main disk for the system, but significant driver problems prevented us from running a stable operating system on it. Instead we\ninstalled separate DiskOnModule flash disks (see below). The The String PC's are running\na minimal Linux operating system.\nFlash disks\nInstead of spinning disks which would have a high failure risk operating at the low\ntemperature and humidity that the String PC's experience, we used robust low-temperature\nflash disks of the DiskOnModule model, made by PQI International. We used the \"wide\ntemperature\" version, rated for -40 \u25e6 C and +85 \u25e6 (same as all other String PC components).\nThese modules have the distinct advantage that they are molded with a standard 40-pin\nIDE connector and integrated IDE controller, such that they look like a standard hard disk\nto the CPU. We installed two modules per String PC (one master and one slave), each 1\nGB.\nAll eight DiskOnModules are essentially clones of one another, containing the\nnecessary operating system and data acquisition software. The systems were designed\nsuch that a direct serial connection from the indoor Master PC could be used to obtain a\nString PC console remotely, in order to perform low level maintenance and troubleshooting\nincluding viewing the BIOS at system startup, in order to change from one DiskOnModule\nto another. It is unclear if this emergency serial connection actually works, however, due\nto an issue in its wiring over the buried surface cables. There have not been any serious\n\n\f42\nproblems in the String PC's to date and none of the envisioned emergency resources have\nbeen necessary.\nRAM disks\nWhile physical flash disks are used to store the system for each String PC, flash\ndisks are known to survive a relatively small number of write cycles. Therefore they are\nrarely written to, and in particular we do not write acquired data to them. Instead we\nhave a 100 MB RAM disk running on each String PC. The RAM disk maps an area of\nRAM such that it looks to the operating system like a standard disk. The String PC's\nhave 256 MB of RAM, so \u223c156 MB remain for use as standard RAM. The String PC RAM\n\nis expected to survive many more write cycles than the flash disks, so this strategy was\nchosen to maximize the life of the String PC. In standard operation, the RAM disk acts as\n\na temporary buffer where data are written during a run. One binary file is written per run.\nAs soon as a run is completed, the data are automatically transferred to the Master PC,\ncompressed as they are transferred in order to save String PC - Master PC bandwidth and\nMaster PC disk space. The 100 MB RAM disk limits the total amount of data that can\nbe acquired in any one run by any one string to 100 MB. This is not a severe constraint\nin standard operation because the quota for for total SPATS data satellite transfer to the\nNorth is 150 MB per day.\nFast analog input/output module\nThere are three high-speed analog input/output modules per String PC (RTD\nmodel IDAN-SDM7540HR-8-68S). These boards have both analog-to-digital (ADC) and\ndigital-to-analog (DAC) channels. Each module supports an ADC bandwidth of 1.25 megasamples per second, which can be divided arbitrarily among 16 single-ended or 8 differential\nchannels, and can be configured as needed in software for each run (we use between 1 and 8\ndifferential channels). While this is the quoted bandwidth, in practice we have only achieved\n200 kilosamples per second (see Chapter 4. Digitized samples are stored in an 8 kilosample\nFIFO, which is read out by a driver.\nA valuable feature of these fast ADC boards is the \"SyncBus\" which we have\nused to connect all three boards per stack together. This allows a single clock signal to\nbe distributed between the boards. We use this to distribute a sample clock between the\n\n\f43\nboards, such that multiple channels per string are sampled synchronously. This is especially\nvaluable because while each board has its own clock the clocks drift relative to one another\n(and relative to absolute time). Using only one clock per String PC, and distributing it,\nsimplifies this problem.\nSlow analog input/output board\nThere is one low-speed analog input/output module per String PC (RTD model\nIDAN-6420HR-1-62S). These boards are similar to the fast boards but have a smaller sampling bandwidth and have a 1 kilosample FIFO instead of 8 kilosample. They also do not\nhave the SyncBus.\nRelay module\nThere is one relay module (RTD model IDAN-DM6952HR-62D) per String PC.\nThis module features two boards, each with 8 electrical relays for a total of 16 relays. One\nrelay is used to control power to each of the seven transmitter modules independently, and\none relay is used to control power to each sensor module independently. One relay is also\nused for the pressure sensor in the bottom transmitter module of each string. The final relay\nsimultaneously controls power to the six temperature sensors in the remaining transmitter\nmodules. The ability to specifically power up/down only the components we need at a\nparticular time enables us to save power. It also gives us the capability of isolating and\ndisabling particular channels in the event of severe damage such as power shorts which\ncould otherwise threaten the entire string.\n\n3.7.5\n\nDSL communictions\nA pair of ethernet extenders (Nexcomm NM220GKIT) is used to provide DSL\n\ncommunications between each string and the Master PC. Four DSL boxes are connected\nto the Master PC, and one is in each of the AJB's connected to the String PC. Each box\nconverts an ethernet signal to a DSL signal that is routed over the surface cable. The\ncommunication speed can be configured via DIP switches on the accessible (Master PC)\nside to be one of a set of speeds between 0.2 and 2.3 Mbps. 2.3 Mbps is currently used for\nall strings. This bandwidth is available in each of the two directions. We use encrypted\ncommunication protocols (SSH and SCP) for logging into the String PC's and transferring\n\n\f44\ndata from them, both in manual and autonomous data taking. The encryption overhead\nresults in an effective data transfer speed somewhat lower than the communication speed.\nThis speed limit is one of two bottlenecks in data acquisition and limits e.g. the total\nchannel multiplicity and sampling frequency that can be used in pinger data taking, where\nthe strategy is to acquire raw recordings for as long as possible from as many channels as\npossible simultaneously.\n\n3.7.6\n\nGPS timing\nA Meinberg GPS clock (PCI board) is installed in the Master PC and connected\n\nto a GPS antenna on the roof of the IceCube Laboratory. The GPS clock produces an\nIRIG-B timing signal which is distributed via the SHSB's over the surface cables to the\nString PC's. The String PC's sample the IRIG-B signal synchronously with the transmitter\nand sensor data in order to determine the absolute time of each sample of each waveform\nwith \u223c10 \u03bcs precision. IRIG-B is a standard digital timing signal that operates at 100\n\npulses per second. The rising edge of each pulse is aligned to absolute GPS time. The\nwidth of each \"high\" pulse encodes binary digits such that all 100 pulses of each one-second\nframe together specify the day of hear, hour, minute, and second at the first rising edge of\nthe frame.\n\n3.8\n\nRetrievable pinger\nA retrievable pinger was developed in 2007 and deployed in the 2007-2008 season.\n\nThe pinger, along with String D, was developed in order to measure the attenuation length\nafter we were unable to do so with the first three strings. The pinger was operated in each\nof six IceCube holes in the 2007-2008 season. An upgraded version was operated in each of\nfour IceCube holes in the 2008-2009 season. The pinger was deployed in each water-filled\nhole just after the IceCube drill was removed, just before an IceCube string was deployed\ninto it. Details about the design of the retrievable pinger are given in Chapter 5 and also\nin [47].\nIn the 2007-2008 season, the horizontal distances between SPATS strings and holes\nin which the pinger were operated ranged between 124.3 m and 543.0 m. In the 2008-2009\nseason, a much larger range of distances was achieved: 156.6 m to 1023.4 m. The horizontal\n\n\f45\ndistances between SPATS strings and holes in which the pinger was operated are given in\nTable 3.5.\n\n3.8.1\n\nVersion 1 (2007-2008 season)\nThe first version of the pinger was operated in six water-filled IceCube holes, as\n\nshown in Figure 3.3. The pinger was free to swing, twist, and bounce. This resulted in\nsignificant pulse-to-pulse and run-to-run variation, and in significant shear wave production.\n\n3.8.2\n\nVersion 2 (2008-2009 season)\nThe second version of the pinger was operated in four water-filled IceCube holes,\n\nas shown in Figure 3.3. For this version, centralizing spring ribs were added to the pinger\nassembly to keep it stable in the center of the IceCube hole during operation, in order to\nkeep the angle of incidence with the hole wall constant and reduce pulse-to-pulse variations,\nrun-to-run variations, and shear wave production.\n\n\f46\n\n600\n\nA (78)\n\nD (76) 77\n\n500\n\n69\n\n400\n\n70\n\nB (72)\n\n71\n\ny (m)\n\n300\n55\n\n200\n\nC (47)\n\n100\n0\n\u2212100\n\u2212200\n\u2212300\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n\n0\nx (m)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n(a)\n600\nD (76)\n\nA (78)\nB (72)\n\n400\n\ny (m)\n\n200\n\nC (47)\n37\n28\n\n0\n\n19\n\n\u2212200\n\n5\n\n\u2212400\n\u2212600\n\u2212600\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n\n0\nx (m)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.3: Surface layout of pinger deployments.

All\ntransmitters and nearly all sensor channels are in good health. The system as a whole\ncontinues to perform well, more than two years after being deployed and operated nearly\ncontinuously in harsh conditions. In particular, the system has survived several unplanned\npower outages. The String PC's recovered from power outages lasting up to \u223c48 hours,\n\nenough time for the computers to equilibrate to the -51 \u25e6 C ambient temperture 2 m below\nthe ice surface. Our ADC boards have presented some technical challenges which we summarize. The transmitters of the first three strings have some unexplained behavior, while\nthe transmitters of the fourth string are behaving as expected.\n\n4.1\n\nTransmitters\nThe transmitters of Strings A, B, and C behaved differently after deployment in\n\nthe ice than prior to deployment in laboratory tests. The electrical pulse shape generated\nby the HV pulser and discharged to the emitter was designed to be a simple unipolar pulse,\nand this shape was verified in the laboratory prior to deployment. For an example HV readback pulse recorded with an oscilloscope in the lab from a transmitter before deployment,\nsee Figure 4.1. For an example recorded with the SPATS DAQ, see Figure 4.2.\nThe pulse shape can also be read out after deployment using the HV read-back\nfeature. Note that the HV read-back pulse is down-scaled by a factor of 500 in amplitude,\nrelative to the HV pulse delivered to the piezoelectric ceramic, for both the String A/B/C\nand the String D design. The transmitters of Strings A, B, and C exhibit complex multi-\n\n\f49\n\nTDS 3054B\n\n19 Sep 2006\n\n18:13:10\n\nFigure 4.1: Example HV read-back pulse recorded with an oscilloscope in the laboratory\nprior to deployment, from a transmitter of the String A/B/C design. Note the clean,\nunipolar shape.\n\nFigure 4.2: Example HV read-back pulse recorded with the SPATS DAQ in the laboratory\nprior to deployment, from a transmitter of the String A/B/C design. Note the clean,\nunipolar shape.\n\n\f50\npolar HV read-back pulse shapes after deployment in the ice, in contradiction to the clean\nunipolar pulses measured in the laboratory prior to deployment.\nThe HV read-back pulses are only sampled at 308 kHz (by the \"slow\" ADC board),\ntoo small a frequency to resolve details in the \u223c10 \u03bcs HV read-back pulses. However, with\n\nappropriate clock drift correction in the offline processing, many pulses can be overlaid to\n\ndetermine the pulse shape with very large effective sampling frequency. This is a beneficial\neffect of the ADC clock drift. If there were no clock drift (and the sampling frequency were\na multiple of the transmitter pulse repetition rate), then corresponding samples of different\npulses would overlap exactly. The presence of clock drift, however, causes the sampling\nto scan (drift) over the pulse shape from one pulse to the next, resulting in an effective\nsampling frequency that is much larger than the nominal sampling frequency.\nHV read-back pulse shapes determined by averaging many individual pulses with\nclock drift correction are shown for Strings A, B, C, and D in Figures 4.3-4.6. These\nrecordings are from inter-string runs taken on December 27, 2007. The multiple oscillations\nand negative components of the waveforms on Strings A, B, and C are unexpected and not\nunderstood. The pulses were expected to be similar to those recorded in the laboratory\nbefore deployment: simple unipolar, positive pulses. One hypothesis is that the ground\nconnection in the transmitters changed after deployment.\nThere are apparently multiple classes of strange performance of the String A/B/C\ntransmitters, corresponding to multiple classes of pulse shapes in the HV readback recordings. AT2, AT3, AT4, BT2, CT3, and CT4 have very similar shape and amplitude.\nThe trigger signal generated by the DAC's in the String PC's and used to fire\nthe transmitters in the ice are square waves. The rising edge initiates charging of the LC\ncircuit in the HV pulser module, and the falling edge initiates discharge of this signal to the\npiezoelectric emitter. A periodic square wave can be used to fire the transmitter cyclically,\nwith the period of the wave determining the repetition rate of the transmitter. For the HV\nreadback pulses shown here, the repetition time was 55 ms. The width of the trigger pulse\n(time between rising and falling edges) can be optimized to maximize the acoustic signal\namplitude. For Strings A, B, and C, the optimum charge time (trigger width) is 5 ms.\nFor String D, it is 2 ms. For both types of transmitter, there is an electrical and acoustic\npre-pulse emitted at the time of the rising edge, in addition to the main pulse at the time\nof the falling edge.\nThe pre-pulses on String D are small.

In comparison with the transmitters\non Strings A, B, and C, the String D transmitters have an HV read-back pulse shape that is\ncloser to the expectation from laboratory measurements and indicates healthy performance\nin comparison with the transmitters on Strings A, B, and C.\n\n\f55\nquite large, often larger than the main pulse.\nFor the HV read-back plots, drift correction was not performed in the standard\nway of dead-reckoning the absolute time of each sample using the IRIG GPS signal. This\nis because the recordings are created by generating the transmitter pulses with a fast ADC\nboard and recording the HV readback signals with the slow ADC board on the same String\nPC. The two boards have different clocks with different drift rates. Correcting for the drift\nusing the dead-reckoning approach would require recording a signal from the fast board\n(to determine its drift rate) in addition to the slow board, which was not done when these\ndata were acquired. Instead of using that algorithm, we use an alternative drift correction\nalgorithm, which minimizes the width of the pulse, where \"width\" is defined to be the time\nover a pre-defined threshold. Minimizing this width with respect to the assumed clock drift\nachieves a very well aligned, coherent overlaid pulse.\nThe HV readback pulse shape is extremely stable, with negligible pulse-to-pulse or\nrun-to-run variation in the pulse signal shape, and with negligible noise in the recordings.\nTo produce the plots shown we first determined the drift rate, then overlaid the samples\nof 1000 pulses according to the actual repetition period (determined from the drift rate).\nEach set of 10 consecutive samples was then averaged together to produce a a waveform\nsampled with \u223c100 times greater effective sampling frequency than that used by the ADC\n\nto sample the original series of pulses.\n\nThe transmitter of Stage 1 of each string is not included in the plots. While\nwe do have the capability to record these HV readback pulses, they use a different ADC\nconfiguration and the software to take these runs is not yet implemented.\nFor these recordings, the transmitter steering amplitude was 1200 DAC counts\n(5.86 V) for String D and 1536 DAC counts (7.5 V) for Strings A, B, and C.\nNote that the curves resulting from overlying many curves have finite thickness,\nand some runs give thicker curves than others. This could be due to residual clock drift\nthat persists even after correcting for most of the drift. However it is actually due to the\nADC conversion jitter, which smears the curves by \u00b1 \u223c1 ADC count vertically. So the\n\nfinite thickness is due to vertical smearing, not horizontal smearing. The effect could be\nreduced by overlying fewer curves, or by averaging. More pulses than necessary are used\nfor the plots shown here.\nThe transmitters of String D were improved in design based on experience with\ntransmitters on Strings A, B, and C. The electrical design of the HV pulser was redesigned to\n\n\f56\nbe more robust with better signal to noise ratio. The String D transmitters are performing\nbetter than those on the first three strings, as can be seen from the shape of the HV\nread-back pulses.\nThe recorded inter-string transmitter signals from transmitters on the first three\nstrings (A, B, and C) are weaker in South Pole ice than expected (from amplitude vs.\ndistance measurements performed in water in Lake Tornetr\u00e4sk in Abisko, Sweden), by an\norder of magnitude in absolute amplitude. The explanation of this is unknown but may\nbe related to the strange pulse shape in the transmitters from these strings. The String D\ntransmitters were not tested in a lake before deployment.\nThe cleanness of the String D HV read-back pulses, and their similarity to those\nfrom pre-deployment laboratory tests, indicate that the String D transmitters are performing better than those on the first three strings (A, B, and C). Nevertheless, acoustic signals\nfrom the transmitters on the first three strings have clearly been detected by sensors on\nother strings hundreds of meters distant. The pulse shape emitted into the ice is likely\ndifferent from that expected from laboratory tests, but the signals can nevertheless be used\nboth for sound speed and attenuation measurements if analysis strategies are used that do\nnot depend on the shape or absolute normalization of the emitted transmitter signals. This\ncan be done by using a waveform energy method to integrate over the total energy in the\npulse (regardless of shape) and by leaving the overall normalization of the signal as a free\nfit parameter. Results using this strategy are presented in Chapter 8.\nOn String D in contrast to Strings A, B, and C, the pulse shape is very similar\nfrom one stage to the next. The amplitude decreases monotonically as the depth (cable\nlength) increases.\nIn addition to the pulse shape on String D being healthier, the String D pulse\nshapes are very similar from one transmitter module to the next. The amplitude of the\npulses decreases with increasing module depth. This is an expected effect due to voltage\ndrop of the transmitter amplitude steering voltage in the 500 m long in-ice cable. The HV\nread-back pulse itself is designed to not be affected by the long cable length (by using a\ndifferential signal), and therefore to represent the true HV pulse delivered to the piezoelectric\nemitter in the ice. On the other hand, the DC steering voltage as well as the DC power\nvoltage and ground level change with depth, and all of these affect the amplitude of the\npulse generated by the HV pulser module. Therefore for a fixed steering voltage at the\nsurface, the actual amplitude delivered by the HV pulser module and therefore the acoustic\n\n\f57\namplitude emitted by the transmitter decreases with increasing module depth. These two\nfeatures (independence of HV read-back amplitude on cable length, and dependence of\nsignal amplitude on cable length) are true for Strings A, B, and C as well as for String D.\n\n4.2\n4.2.1\n\nSensors\nGood and bad channels\nThe sensors are performing well, with 74 of 80 (93%) of deployed channels con-\n\nsidered \"good\". See Section 6.1 for a list of good/bad channels and discussion of their\nbehavior.\n\n4.2.2\n\nAzimuthal module orientation\nEach sensor module has three piezoelectric transducers inside, oriented 120\u25e6 apart\n\nin azimuth. The channels are labeled both with numbers and letters: A=2, B=1, C=0 (Note\nthe counter-intuitive mapping). Looking at the stages from above (with cable penetrator\npointing up), the channels are ordered with A, B, C in counter-clockwisse order. While\neach stage is fixed in orientation relative to the SPATS cable, the cable twists arbitrarily\nover its 400-500 m length and therefore the absolute orientation of the three channels inside\neach stage cannot be determined during deployment.\nHowever, the absolute orientation of each channel can be determined using arrival\ntime differences between the different channels.\nThis strategy was used successfully to determine the sensor module orientation\nin the Lake Tornetr\u00e4sk test. At this time the DAQ software was only capable of reading\nout two of the three channels simultaneously, and this was still sufficient to determine\nthe rough orientation of the module. Using all three channels, it should be possible to\ndetermine the absolute orientation of each module with \u223c10\u25e6 resolution. This could be\nvaluable for understanding the relative sensitivity of the different channels in each module,\n\nby understanding which channels are pointed toward the signal source and which have the\nmodule housing between the channel and the source.\nIn the lake test, a sensor module was fixed in one position, through a hole in the\nice covering the lake. A transmitter was then deployed 400 meters away from the sensor\nand pulsed repeatedly. It was then moved to another location such that data were collected\n\n\f58\nwith the transmitter 400 m distant in each of the cardinal directions from the sensor. A\ncompass was not used to determine the cardinal directions exactly, but the four positions\nare labeled approximately according to the cardinal directions. The software triggered the\ntransmitter and recorded the sensors using the same ADC clock, such that absolute acoustic\nsignal propagation time could be determined for each pulse without the need for any GPS\ntiming.\nResults from the lake test are shown in Figure 4.7. The path difference between\nthe channels is \u223c10 cm of steel. The measured difference in arrival times between the two\n\nchannels is in the range of \u223c 10-50\u03bcs, depending on the direction to the transmitter. The\nacoustic signal is expected to propagate through the steel cylinder at \u223c6000 m/s, giving an\n\nexpected time difference of \u223c20 \u03bcs. The time between ADC samples on each channel was\n0.8\u03bcs.\n\nThe difference in arrival times constrains the sensor module orientation: Channel\nC is pointed toward the southeast, B toward the northwest, and A toward the northeast.\nThe transit times were varying over time while the transmitter was in the \"North\" position.\nThis could be explained if the cable was rotating clockwise (as seen from the top) during the\nmeasurement, such that Channel B rotated toward the transmitter and Channel C rotated\naway. The total amount of rotation was less than 180\u25e6 over the duration of the \"North\"\nrecordings.\nThe orientation can be calculated quantitatively using a two-parameter fit: the\nazimuthal orientation of the module and the effective propagation speed through the pressure housing are free parameters. The model uses the actual distance between channels and\nallows the propagation speed as well as the orientation to vary. The chi-square statistic can\nbe minimized to determine the actual azimuthal orientation of the module. An example\nchi-square contour plot is shown in Figure 4.8.\n\n4.3\n\nString PC performance\nThe String PC's are performing well, even better than expected. Despite problems\n\ngetting a stable flash disk and a stable operating system in the laboratory, the String PC's\nhave performed well over more than two years buried under 2 m of ice at the South Pole.\nThere have been several planned and unplanned power outages when one or more strings\nhave been powered down for up to 48 hours. During such periods the String PC's cool down\n\n\f59\n\n(a) \"North\"\n\n(b) \"East\"\n\n(c) \"South\"\n\n(d) \"West\"\n\nFigure 4.7: Time of flight for each of two sensor channels in a sensor module in the lake\ntest. The transmitter was pulsed from four different directions at 400 m distance, while\nthe sensor was held stationary. The finite time between samples (0.8 \u03bcs) can be seen. The\noscillation period in the signal can also be seen in the \"East\" plot: for the Channel B events\nthe algorithm sometimes identified the first cycle correctly and sometimes missed it and\nonly found the second cycle. The cycle oscillation time is \u223c30 \u03bcs. The data constrain the\norientation of the sensor module.\n\n\f60\n\nFigure 4.8: Reduced-\u03c72 contours as a function of azimuthal orientation and effective propagation speed between sensor channels. This method has been demonstrated with two\nchannels per module using lake test data. It could be applied to South Pole data using all\nthree channels per module to determine the orientation of every SPATS module in the ice.\n\n\f61\nand approach the ambient temperature in the ice, then warm up over several hours after\nbeing powered up again.\nThe String PC's have recovered from each of these outages without any problems.\nIn some cases the baseline noise level has changed very slightly on sensor channels after\none of these power cycles. This could be due to a change in the absolute calibration of the\nADC's. They have an auto-calibration feature, which we are currently not using, which\ncould reduce this effect. However it is barely noticeable already.\n\n4.4\n\nADC performance\nThere have been several problems with both our fast and our slow ADC boards.\n\nSome of these have been solved by improving the driver software provided by the ADC\ncompany. Others have been mitigated by adapting our DAQ strategy.\n\n4.4.1\n\nDMA timeouts, ADC hanging, and ADC sampling frequency limitations\n\n\"Slow\" board: sampling frequency\nThe \"slow\" ADC boards we have (one per String PC, Real Time Devices model\nDM6420HR) are specified to operate at up to 500 kHz total sampling frequency (integrated\nacross channels). Initially we could only operate it at \u223c100 kHz before it hung. After\n\nseveral iterations of upgrading the driver, we now operate it at 308 kHz without problems.\nWe cannot achieve the specified 500 kHz and the company has acknowledged that this\nis probably impossible, at least with a Linux operating system. These boards are used\nprimarily for recording the HV read-back signals.\n\"Fast\" board: hanging, DMA timeouts, and sampling frequency\nThe \"fast\" ADC boards we have (three per String PC, Real Time Devices model\nSDM7540HR) are specified to operate at a maximum sampling frequency (integrated across\nchannels) of 1.25 MHz. Again we had severe problems achieving reasonable sampling until\nwe made significant modifications to the device driver.\nThe boards were chosen in order to use ADC boards 0, 1, and 2 to sample module\nchannels 0, 1, and 2 respectively. This would allow 1.25 MHz divided among 7 modules\n\n\f62\nper string to achieve 179 kHz sampling frequency per channel and sample all 21 channels\nper string simultaneously. Unfortunately we have only been able to achieve 200 kHz total\nsampling frequency per board, compared to the specified 1.25 MHz. As for the slow board,\nthe ADC company has confirmed that they do not know how to achieve the specified\nmaximum throughput in Linux, despite their advertisements of full Linux support.\nIncreasing the sampling frequency (or the run duration) causes runs to hang and\nrequire being killed by an external signal (from the user or from a watchdog script). These\nhanging events are caused by DMA time outs, and when they occur there is a kernel message\nthat there was a DMA time out. Currently we are able to acquire with one channel per\nboard per string, in order to read out three channels per string, at 200 kHz each, for\ntransient threshold-triggered runs of 45-minute duration. This results in a few percent of\nruns failing with DMA time outs. Increasing the sampling frequency, channel multiplicity,\nor run duration increases the failure rate. As a workaround, we execute all runs inside a\nwatchdog script that terminates hanging runs so that the next run can begin.\n\n4.4.2\n\nLeading zeros\nWith the \"fast\" board, even after the driver upgrades described above, the first\n\nread call of every run begins with a string of zero-valued samples returned by the driver.\nThere are typically on the order of a few thousand zeros at the beginning of every waveform\ndue to this problem. As a workaround, the software allows a user-configured \"dead time\"\nat the beginning of every run. This duration of samples is acquired and discarded so that\nthe actual waveform written to disk does not include any leading zeros. Using a dead time\nof 100 ms is sufficient to remove all leading zeros.\n\n4.4.3\n\nClock drift\n\nDescription of the clock drift problem\nOn each of the four strings there are four ADC boards, one \"slow\" and three \"fast\"\nmodels. The fast boards are used to digitize the sensor waveforms. The slow board is used\nto digitize the transmitter HV read-back signals, as well as for some transmitter control\nfunctions. Each board has its own sample clock, which is used to drive both ADC and\nDAC operation. The boards were discovered to drift over time. That is, the sample time\n(number of samples actually processed) deviates from the true time (number of samples\n\n\f63\nthat should have been processed according to the absolute amount of time that has passed)\nby an amount that increases over time. Put another way, the actual sampling frequency\ndiffers from the nominal sampling frequency. The deviation is typically on the order of a few\nparts per million. That is, the nominal time increases or decreases by a few microseconds\nper second, relative to the absolute time. We define the \"drift rate\" as follows:\ndrift rate d =\n\nactual sampling frequency\n\u2212 1.\nnominal sampling frequency\n\n(4.1)\n\nTypical drift rates are on the order of a few parts per million (positive or negative).\nClock drift is most important when averaging pulses over a long duration in the\ntime domain, and the severity of the problem increases with the recording duration. The\nproblem is severe for inter-string recordings of duration \u223c100 s and moderate for retrievable\n\npinger recordings of duration \u223c20 s.\n\nSolution to the clock drift problem\nWe have developed several algorithms to correct the clock drift problem. The best\none uses the IRIG GPS data stream, which is included in every sample of every waveform\n(as a single bit in the 16-bit word of each sample), to determine the absolute time of each\nsample directly. The algorithm works directly on each waveform (run), without any other\ninformation necessary. The algorithm works by first determining the rising edges in the\nIRIG data stream, which occur every 10 ms (absolute GPS time). These are then used\nto determine the \"transfer function\" that gives absolute time as a function of the sample\nnumber in the recording. The transfer function is automatically sampled every 10 ms by\nthe IRIG rising edges. This is frequently enough to determine the drift of the clock, but is\nmuch less frequent than typical sampling frequencies used for waveform recordings. We then\nfit a polynomial to the function for smoothness (without the polynomial, the function is\nonly defined every 10 ms and is discontinuous and introduces artifacts). For most waveform\ndurations (up to \u223c100 ms), a linear fit is sufficient. For longer durations, a second order\n\nfit is sometimes necessary (this means that we are including the \"drift of the drift\"). This\ntransfer function is then used to determine the absolute time (measured since the waveform\nacquisition began) of each sample, as a function of its sample number. After applying this\nclock drift correction algorithm, we know the time of each sample with \u223c10 \u03bcs accuracy.\n\n\f64\n\nChapter 5\n\nMeasurement of sound speed vs.\ndepth: pressure waves and shear\nwaves\nOur measurement of the speed of both pressure and shear waves as a function of depth in\nSouth Pole ice is the first measurement we completed with SPATS, and has been the focus\nof much of my personal analysis effort. I therefore include it as a stand-alone chapter, with\nall of my other analysis results described in the following chapter. The measurement has\nimplications for both neutrino astronomy and glaciology. A modified version of this chapter\nhas been submitted for publication and is available at [48].\nAbstract\n\nWe have measured the speed of both pressure waves and shear waves as a func-\n\ntion of depth between 80 and 500 m depth in South Pole ice with better than 1% precision.\nThe measurements were made using the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS), an array\nof transmitters and sensors deployed in the ice at South Pole Station in order to measure\nthe acoustic properties relevant to acoustic detection of astrophysical neutrinos. The transmitters and sensors use piezoelectric ceramics operating at \u223c5-25 kHz. Between 200 m and\n500 m depth, the measured profile is consistent with zero variation of the sound speed with\n\ndepth, resulting in zero refraction, for both pressure and shear waves.

These results\nhave encouraging implications for neutrino astronomy: The negligible refraction of acoustic\nwaves deeper than 200 m indicates that good neutrino direction and energy reconstruction,\nas well as separation from background events, could be achieved.\n\n5.1\n\nIntroduction\nThe speed of sound in ice has been studied in theory, in the laboratory, and in\n\nthe field. In addition to pure interest in elastic materials physics, the measurement has\napplications to both geophysics [49, 50] and neutrino astronomy [51]. At the South Pole,\none measurement was made previously for pressure waves at seismic frequencies, for depths\nbetween 0 m and 186 m (i.e., in the layer of surface snow that is not yet fully densified to\n\n\f66\nice, known as \"firn\"), using surface explosions [52].\nBeyond the South Pole, previous authors have also reported a variety of sound\nspeed measurements in a wide range of conditions including laboratory and field measurements. Field measurements have previously been made across the Antarctic and Greenland\nice sheets and in temperate glaciers. In principle the sound speed can vary from site to\nsite due to differences in bubble concentration, temperature, and grain orientation. The\ngrain orientation as a function of position in a glacier is the \"fabric.\" The fabric can have\na significant effect on the sound speed because the speed in monocrystalline ice varies by\n7% depending on the direction of propagation relative to the crystal axis [7]. If the grain\norientation is random, the sound speed is homogeneous and isotropic on macroscopic scales.\nIf there is non-random fabric, the sound speed can be inhomogeneous or anisotropic.\nWe report an in situ measurement made using transmitters and sensors deployed\nbetween 80 and 500 m depth and operating in the audible to ultrasonic band. In addition\nto making an independent measurement of pressure wave speed in the firn and extending\nWeihaupt's measurements from the firn deep into the bulk ice, we have measured for the\nfirst time the speed of shear waves in both the firn and bulk ice. Previously, the best\nestimate of South Pole shear wave speed was a model based on the pressure wave speed and\nPoisson's ratio [49], and only applied in the firn where pressure wave speed measurements\nwere available.\nSouth Pole ice is uniquely suited as a medium for detection of high-energy (1011 1020 eV) neutrinos of astrophysical origin. The interactions of these neutrinos in ice produce\noptical, radio, and acoustic radiation, each of which therefore provides a possible method\nof detecting the neutrinos. The optical method is well suited for neutrinos of energy up\nto 1017 eV, while the radio and acoustic methods are well suited for neutrinos of higher\nenergy. Deep ice at the South Pole has been shown to be extremely transparent in optical\nwavelengths [53]. The AMANDA [54] and IceCube [55] detectors have been developed to\nexploit this for optical neutrino detection. Antarctic ice is even more transparent in radio\nwavelengths [56, 57], and the Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment (RICE) [58] was operated to\nsearch for radio signals from astrophysical neutrinos. In situ measurements of the acoustic\nattenuation length in South Pole ice are in progress [51].\nTo detect the \"cosmogenic\" neutrinos of energy \u223c1017\u221219 eV produced by ultra-\n\nhigh-energy cosmic rays interacting with the cosmic microwave background radiation, a\ndetector with effective volume on the order of 100 km3 is necessary. While the optical\n\n\f67\nmethod is well understood and calibrated with atmospheric neutrinos, it is prohibitively\nexpensive to scale to such a size. The acoustic and radio methods, on the other hand, can\nin principle be used to instrument a large volume sparsely and achieve good sensitivity per\ncost in this energy range.\nThe acoustic radiation is produced by the \"thermoacoustic\" mechanism: A neutrino interacts to produce a shower of particles, which locally heats the medium, causing it\nto expand and produce a bipolar shock wave. The pulse width (peak frequency) and shape\ndepend on the sensor location relative to the shower. The acoustic source is simply the\nregion over which significant heat is deposited by the shower: a filament with length of a\nfew meters and diameter of a few centimeters. The filament is aligned along the incident\nneutrino direction. The acoustic radiation pattern is a wide, flat disk perpendicular to the\nfilament and therefore perpendicular to the neutrino direction [21]. The peak frequency is\n\u223c30 kHz at a distance of 1 km from the source, for points near the center of the radiation\n\npattern [35].\n\nSouth Pole ice is predicted to be especially well suited for acoustic detection of\nextremely high-energy neutrinos [8]. In comparison to ocean water, the signal amplitude is\npredicted to be larger in ice and the background noise has been determined by SPATS to\nbe much more stable in ice [59].\nAs a solid, ice also has the unique advantage that it can support shear wave\npropagation. If neutrinos produce shear waves in addition to pressure waves, a single\nacoustic sensor detecting both pulses could determine the distance to the interaction vertex\nas well as the particle shower energy. Multiple sensors seeing some combination of pressure\nand shear waves could reconstruct the neutrino energy and direction better than if pressure\nwaves alone were detected. However while much theoretical and experimental work has\nbeen done on pressure waves generated by the thermoacoustic mechanism, little work has\nbeen done on shear waves. It has been argued on theoretical grounds [43] that shear wave\nproduction by the thermoacoustic mechanism is suppressed, but other mechanisms could\nproduce shear waves and in any case laboratory measurements are necessary.\nThe South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS) [60] was installed to measure the\nacoustic properties of South Pole ice relevant to neutrino astronomy, in particular the sound\nspeed profile, the background noise (both the noise floor and the impulsive transients), and\nthe attenuation length. Here we focus on the first of these: the sound speed as a function\nof depth. Sufficiently mapping this profile in situ allows precise reconstruction of the lo-\n\n\f68\ncation of transient acoustic sources in the ice, which has now been achieved with SPATS\nusing the results presented here [61]. In addition to the neutrino astronomy applications\nwe consider here, transient source reconstruction could have interesting applications to geophysics. These could include acoustic emission from cracking in the bulk ice as well as from\nstick-slip movement at the bedrock interface [8, 62, 63]. Detecting, localizing, and characterizing either of these source classes would improve our understanding of glacial dynamics.\nMoreover, precise knowledge of the the sound speed profile itself is necessary to measure\nice thickness using reflection shooting [50].\n\n5.2\n5.2.1\n\nExperimental method\nFrozen-in sensors\nThe IceCube array is currently under construction. 40 IceCube holes were drilled\n\nprior to February 2008 (Figure 5.1). An additional 19 holes were drilled between December\n2008 and January 2009. Each IceCube hole contains a string with 60 digital optical modules\nbetween 1450 m and 2450 m depth. Each hole is drilled with hot water to produce a\nstanding water column \u223c60 cm in diameter and 2450 m in height. The instrumentation is\n\nthen installed in the hole and the water column re-freezes around it.\n\nThe SPATS array consists of 4 strings, each deployed alongside an IceCube string\nin an IceCube hole. A schematic of the array is given in Figure 3.2. Each SPATS string\ncontains 7 acoustic \"stages.\" Each stage comprises one transmitter module and one sensor\nmodule. For the measurement presented here, only the sensor of each stage was used and\na separate, retrievable pinger was used instead of the frozen-in transmitters. On Strings A,\nB, and C the stages are at 80, 100, 140, 190, 250, 320, and 400 m depth. On String D the\nstages are at 140, 190, 250, 320, 400, 430, and 500 m depth. Each acoustic sensor module\ncontains 3 piezoelectric sensor channels (each with its own pre-amplifier), with the exception\nof the modules at 190 m and 430 m depth on String D. Each of these two modules contains a\nsingle sensor channel of an alternative design (\"Hydrophone for Acoustic detection at South\nPole\", HADES [45]). The sensors are sensitive in the 5 to 100 kHz range. The signal of the\nfrozen-in transmitters (not used for this analysis) is broadband and peaked at \u223c50 kHz.\n\nThe analog output of each channel is transmitted along copper cables to the sur-\n\nface, where it is digitized at 200 kilosamples per second by a rugged embedded computer\n\n\f69\n(\"String PC\") installed in a junction box buried 2 m beneath the snow surface. Power, communications, and timing are distributed over surface cables several hundred meters long to\neach of the String PC's from an indoor server (\"Master PC\") in the IceCube Laboratory.\nIn addition to digitizing the sensor waveforms, the String PC time stamps them.\nAbsolute time stamping is achieved with an IRIG-B signal routed to the String PC's from\na GPS clock (Meinberg model GPS169PCI ) installed in the Master PC. A single IRIG-B\noutput from the clock is fanned out into four cables routed to the String PC's. The GPS\nclock is specified to produce IRIG-B rising edges within \u00b12 \u03bcs of absolute GPS time. The\n\ndelay introduced in the IRIG-B signals during propagation from Master PC to String PC\nis a few \u03bcs, negligible compared to other sources of timing uncertainty in this analysis.\nTo acquire the results presented here, each sensor channel was recorded continuously for 9 s in order to capture 9 consecutive pulses of the pinger which was operated at\n\na 1 Hz repetition rate. On each string the sensor channels were read out one by one and\nlooped over sequentially.\n\n5.2.2\n\nRetrievable pinger\nIn addition to the permanently deployed array of sensors and transmitters, a re-\n\ntrievable pinger was operated in six water-filled IceCube holes, prior to IceCube string deployment in each hole, during the 2007-2008 season.1 The pinger consisted of an isotropic\npiezoelectric emitter ball and a high voltage (HV) module. The HV module consisted of a\nhigh voltage generator circuit contained in a steel pressure housing. The emitter ball (model\nITC-1001 from the International Transducer Company) produced a broadband pulse peaked\nin the \u223c5-25 kHz range. It was suspended \u223c1.7 m below the HV module to reduce the effect\n\nof acoustic reflections off the steel housing. The pinger was deployed on a steel-armored,\n\nfour-conductor cable, which provided both the mechanical and electrical connection from\nthe pinger to the surface. It was lowered and raised from the surface with a winch. The\nlength of the cable was \u223c2700 m, most of which remained spooled on the winch throughout\n\nthe deployment.\n\nOn the surface, a GPS clock (Garmin model GPS 18 LVC ) was used to generate\na 1 pulse per second (PPS) signal, with the rising edge of each pulse aligned to the start of\neach GPS second. The PPS signal was routed over the armored cable to the pinger where\n1\nAn upgraded version of the pinger was operated in four holes in the 2008-2009 season. Here we focus\non results from the 2007-2008 season.\n\n\f70\nit served as a trigger signal to pulse the pinger at 1 Hz with emission at known absolute\ntimes (modulo 1 s). The rising edge of the PPS signal initiated charging of the HV pulser\ncircuit, followed by discharge a time te later, immediately resulting in acoustic emission.\nThis emission time delay introduced by the HV pulser was measured in the laboratory to\nbe te = 1.9 \u00b1 0.05 ms over the range of temperatures in which the pinger operated (\u221220 \u25e6 C\nto +20 \u25e6 C). The electrical pulse-to-pulse variation of the HV pulser module is negligible.\n\nThe electrical signal propagation speed through the \u223c2700 m cable is 67% of the\n\nspeed of light in vacuum according to the manufacturer's specifications, resulting in a \u223c13 \u03bcs\n\npredicted cable delay time. This delay was verified in the laboratory to be on the order of\n10 \u03bcs, negligible compared with other contributions to the timing uncertainty. The GPS\nclock is specified to produce rising edges synchronized with absolute time within \u00b11 \u03bcs.\n\nAlthough the electrical pulse applied to the transmitter is unipolar, both the trans-\n\nmitter and the sensors ring. This means that each pulse waveform contains many cycles\n(oscillations). The rising edge of the first one is used to determine the acoustic signal\npropagation time.\nThe pinger pulsed at 1 Hz repetition rate while it was lowered from the surface\nto a maximum depth of 400-500 m and then raised back to the surface. At each depth for\nwhich there was a frozen-in sensor on the recording SPATS strings, lowering was halted to\nkeep the pinger stationary for 5 minutes. This scheme guaranteed that every sensor channel\nof the SPATS array recorded one complete 9 s waveform while the pinger was stopped at\neach depth.\nIn addition to the expected pressure waves, shear waves were clearly detected\nfor many pinger-sensor configurations. Shear waves were previously detected from frozenin SPATS transmitters, but it was a surprise to detect them from the pinger operating in\nwater through which shear waves cannot propagate. While the shear waves from the frozenin transmitters were likely produced at the piezoelectric transducers themselves, the shear\nwaves from the pinger in water were likely produced by mode conversion at the water/ice\ninterface (hole wall). Such mode conversion would be suppressed if the incident angle were\nnormal, but if the pinger was not in the center of the hole the incident angle was oblique\nand shear wave production was favored. Pinger pressure wave and shear wave identification\nand characterization are presented in detail in [51]\nIn the 2008-2009 season the pinger was operated with a mechanical centralizer\nto keep it close to the center of the hole, and the shear wave production was suppressed\n\n\f71\nin that data compared to the 2007-2008 data analyzed here. The transmission (for both\npressure and shear waves) and reflection (for pressure waves only) coefficients in terms of\nthe incident angle are given by the Zoeppritz equations [64]. However they are difficult to\napply to this problem because the incident angle depends on the unknown lateral position\nof the pinger in the hole.\n\n5.3\n5.3.1\n\nData analysis\nGeometry\nWe analyzed two pinger-to-sensor hole combinations: Hole 69 to String D and\n\nHole 71 to String B. Two combinations were used both as a cross-check and to increase\nthe number of depths included in the analysis. The two hole combinations used for this\nanalysis are nearest neighbors in the IceCube grid (125 m nominal spacing). The horizontal\ndistances between the holes (measured by a surveyor) are 124.9 m for Hole 69 to String D,\nand 124.6 m for Hole 71 to String B.\nThere are three contributions to the uncertainty in the horizontal separation between the pinger and sensor. First, the center of each hole at the surface is determined by\nsurveying to \u00b10.1 m precision in each of the x and y coordinates. Second, each IceCube\nhole has a radius of \u223c0.3 m. Assuming the pinger could be located laterally anywhere in\n\nthe cylinder with equal probability, each of the x and y coordinates is within \u00b10.17 m of\n\nthe hole center at 68% confidence. Similar logic applies for the sensor. Third, the drill\nhead drifts laterally during drilling of each hole. Using inclinometers located on the drill\nhead, we estimate this drift to be \u00b10.5 m in each coordinate. This effect dominates the\n\nfirst two effects. Therefore the uncertainty in the horizontal location of each of the pinger\n\nand sensor is \u00b10.5 m and the uncertainty in the horizontal distance between the two is\n\u221a\n\u00b10.5 m \u00d7 2 = \u00b10.71 m.\nThe depth of each frozen-in SPATS sensor was verified during string deployment\n\nwith a pressure sensor. Each SPATS sensor depth is within \u00b12 m of nominal. The pinger\n\ndepth was monitored in two ways: using pressure sensors and counting the number of turns\nof the winch during lowering. These two measurements were averaged together to determine\nthe absolute pinger depth with \u00b15 m uncertainty. Due to a mistake made in converting\n\nwinch turns to depth (later corrected and verified with the pressure sensors), the pinger was\n\n\f72\n\nHole 69 to DS7\u22120 (Run 30733, 488.4 m depth) average waveform\n4\n3\n\nSensor voltage (V)\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n0\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\nTime (ms from start of GPS second)\n\n100\n\n(a)\nHole 69 to DS7\u22120 (Run 30733): vP = 3889.1 +/\u2212 37.8 m/s @ 488.4 m\n4\n3\n\nSensor voltage (V)\n\n2\n1\n\nwaveform error\nwaveform mean\nthreshold: 0.1 V\ntarrival\n\ntarrival +/\u2212 \u03b4tarrival\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\n34.4\n34.5\n34.6\n34.7\nTime (ms from start of GPS second)\n\n34.8\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.2: An example waveform recorded by a sensor. (a) shows the full average waveform\nresulting from averaging 9 pulses, accounting for clock drift. Both the pressure pulse and\nthe shear pulse are clearly visible above the noise. The small pre-pulse before the main\npressure pulse is an acoustic pulse initiated by the rising edge of the pinger trigger signal\n(the main pulse is discharged by the falling edge of the trigger signal, 1.9 ms later). (b)\nshows a close-up of the beginning of the main pressure wave. For each sample in the mean\nwaveform, the uncertainty is estimated to be \u00b11 standard error of the mean of the 9 samples\n\ncontributing to the average. The threshold used to determine the signal start time is shown,\nas are the signal start time and uncertainty of the start time.\n\n\f73\nstopped at depths that are systematically shallower than the instrumented sensor depths,\nby an amount that increases with depth. For the measurement with the sensor at 500 m\ndepth, the pinger was at 477 m depth. This has the effect that the relative uncertainty in the\nsound speed is \u00b10.6% for shallow depths (where it is dominated by the horizontal distance\n\nuncertainty) and increases to \u00b11% for deep depths (where the pinger depth uncertainty\n\ncontributes nearly as much as the horizontal distance uncertainty).\n\nWhile pressure and shear wave pulses were detected for many pinger-sensor combinations, for this analysis we selected only those with very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\nsufficient to not only resolve the pulse but also to resolve its start time precisely. For shear\nwaves, only String D had sufficient SNR to identify the pulse start time precisely. Within\nString D only the 5 non-HADES sensors had sufficient SNR, so there are 5 high-quality\nshear wave measurements. For pressure waves, all 7 String D sensors, and 5 of 7 String B\nsensors, had runs with sufficient SNR. This resulted in pressure wave measurements at 8\ndifferent depths, 4 of which have measurements with both strings. For those depths with\nsound speed measured redundantly, the results agree well.\n\n5.3.2\n\nPropagation time\nEach 9 s sensor waveform contains 9 pinger pulses, which were averaged together\n\nto increase the pulse SNR. For each pulse sample both the mean and the standard deviation amplitude were determined. This averaging procedure was designed to decrease the\n(incoherent) noise by a factor of 3 without affecting the signal amplitude.\nWhile the pinger emission is driven by a clock which is continuously synchronized\nwith GPS time, the sensor recording is driven by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)\nclock which drifts by an amount on the order of 10 \u03bcs per second. That is, the actual\nsampling frequency typically differs from the nominal sampling frequency by \u223c10 parts per\nmillion. Furthermore, the actual sampling frequency varies with time (the clock drift rate\n\nitself drifts). This means that pulse averaging using the nominal time of each acquired\nsample results in large decoherence and a false average waveform. This clock drift effect\nwas removed by using the true absolute time of each sample as determined continuously\nfrom the IRIG-B GPS signal. This is a 100 PPS digital signal that is sampled synchronously\nwith the sensor voltage data. Rising edges occur every 10 ms and pulse widths encode the\nabsolute time.\n\n\f74\nAfter applying the clock drift correction algorithm, the absolute time of each sample of the waveform is known with a precision of \u00b110 \u03bcs. These absolute times were used\nin the pulse averaging: Absolute sample times were wrapped modulo the pulse repetition\n\nperiod (1 second), and were then sorted and binned to determine the average time and\namplitude of each consecutive set of 9 samples. Figure ?? shows a typical average waveform\nrecorded by a sensor. Although the signal start time is clear in this example, for other\nwaveforms it was unclear if the algorithm selected the correct first signal oscillation or was\nwrong by \u223cone oscillation period. An uncertainty of \u00b10.05 ms was therefore assigned to\nthe start time for all waveforms.\n\nFor each averaged waveform, a bipolar discriminator was applied to determine the\nstart time. The noise level varied too much from channel to channel to use a fixed threshold,\nbut for each channel the first cycle of the pinger signal was clearly visible above the noise.\nTherefore a threshold was manually chosen for each channel. The first threshold crossing\nwas then verified by eye to be a good estimate of the signal start time for each channel. The\nuncertainty on this arrival time determination is estimated to be \u00b10.05 ms, corresponding\n\nto \u223c1 signal oscillation period.\n\nThe uncertainty of the emission time is simply that of the HV pulser time delay,\n\nincluding variation with temperature: \u00b10.05 ms.\n\n5.4\n5.4.1\n\nResults\nOverview\nFigure 5.3 shows our measurement of the sound speed versus depth for both pres-\n\nsure and shear waves.

As expected, the shear wave\nspeed at this depth (1921 \u00b1 11 m/s) is slower than in the deep ice.\n\n\f77\n\n2050\n\nShear wave speed (m/s)\n\nPressure wave speed (m/s)\n\n3950\n\n3900\n\n3850\n\n3800\n\n3750\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n400\nDepth (m)\n\n450\n\n2000\n\n1950\n\n1900\n\n1850\n\n500\n\n250\n\n3910\n\n450\n\n500\n\n2010\n\n3900\n3890\n3880\n3870\n3860\n3850\n\u22120.4\n\n350\n400\nDepth (m)\n\n(b)\nShear wave speed at 375 m depth (m/s)\n\nPressure wave speed at 375 m depth (m/s)\n\n(a)\n\n300\n\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\nPressure wave speed gradient (m/s/m)\n\n(c)\n\n0.4\n\n2000\n1990\n1980\n1970\n1960\n1950\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\nShear wave speed gradient (m/s/m)\n\n0.4\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5.4: Pressure wave (a) and shear wave (b) speed vs. depth between 250 and 500 m\ndepth.

This measurement was performed in January 1999 as part of deployment of\nthe AMANDA neutrino telescope. Dynamite was attached to detonation cord and lowered\nto a depth zd = 50 \u00b1 5 m in a mechanically drilled hole. This hole was located \u223c15 m\n\nhorizontally from AMANDA Hole 13, which had an acoustic sensor (hydrophone) at depth\nzh = 2250 \u00b1 10 m. The detonation cord had an active core of PETN (pentaerythritol\ntetranitrate). An electrical circuit near the blasting cap end of the cord triggered a digital\noscilloscope to start recording the hydrophone signal.\nA pulse was clearly visible above the noise, at an arrival time ta = 566 \u00b1 5 ms\n\nafter the trigger. Assuming the detonation signal propagated2 at vd = 6750 \u00b1 250 m/s\nthrough the cord of length L = 52 \u00b1 3 m, the measured pressure wave speed is\nvP =\n\nzh \u2212 zd\n= 3941 \u00b1 41 m/s.\nta \u2212 L/vd\n\n(5.7)\n\nThe precision achieved in this measurement is \u00b11.0%. It gives the pressure wave\n\nspeed averaged over the depth profile from 50 to 2250 m depth. It is consistent with the\nresult obtained from the piezoelectric instrumentation, despite the significantly different\nfrequency band and depth range. This integral, vertical measurement is complementary to\nthe differential, horizontal measurement. It provides a valuable cross check and extends the\nrange of measurement to nearly the entire thickness (2.8 km) of the South Pole ice. The\nexplosives measurement indicates that the pressure wave speed gradient is small not only\nin the 200-500 m depth range but also down to \u223c2 km depth.\n\n5.6\n5.6.1\n\nRefraction\nCalculated ray trajectories in firn and bulk ice\nWe have calculated the trajectory of individual acoustic rays to illustrate the\n\ndegree of refraction for various source depths and emission directions. Figure 5.5 shows\nexample ray trajectories calculated for pressure waves. The ray tracing was performed\n2\nThe detonation cord was \"Red Cord\" from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). ICI was purchased by\nOrica Mining Services Worldwide, which now makes the same cord under the name \"Cordtex Pyrocord\nDetonating Cord.\" The detonation velocity we use is taken from the manufacturer's data sheet.\n\n\f79\nTable 5.1: Error budget for two example data points. Each is for pinging from Hole 69 and\nreceiving on String D. While the error contribution from the horizontal distance is nearly\nthe same for all data points, the contribution from the pinger depth increases with depth.\nThis is because the vertical distance between the pinger and sensor increases with depth,\nand the error contribution is proportional to this difference.\nP wave\n\nS wave\n\nsensor depth (m)\n\n500\n\n140\n\npinger depth (m)\n\n477\n\n138\n\nsound speed (m/s)\n\n3889\n\n1921\n\nerror due to horizontal distance (%)\n\n0.54\n\n0.57\n\nerror due to pinger depth (%)\n\n0.72\n\n0.06\n\nerror due to sensor depth (%)\n\n0.29\n\n0.02\n\nerror due to emission time (%)\n\n0.15\n\n0.08\n\nerror due to arrival time (%)\n\n0.15\n\n0.08\n\ntotal error (%)\n\n0.97\n\n0.58\n\nusing an algorithm [65] that treats the ice as a layered medium, in each layer of which the\nsound speed gradient is constant. Because the gradient is constant in each thin layer, the\nray segment in each layer is an arc of a circle. This algorithm gives a fast and accurate\npiecewise second order approximation to the true ray path and simultaneously calculates\nthe integrated path length and travel time. Note that in the presence of a vertical velocity\ngradient, even horizontally emitted rays are refracted toward the direction of decreasing\nsound speed.\n\n5.6.2\n\nRadius of curvature in bulk ice\nBecause the trajectory of a ray in a medium with constant sound speed gradient\n\nis a circle, a convenient way to quantify the amount of refraction is the radius of curvature:\nR=\n\nv\n,\n|g|\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere v is the sound speed and g is the gradient of the sound speed. For pressure (shear)\nwaves, our joint fit for the sound speed and sound speed gradient gives a best fit radius of\ncurvature of \u223c44 km (\u223c29 km). With a 44 km radius of curvature, a ray of length L=1 km\n\n\f80\n(a possible propagation distance from source to sensor in a large neutrino detector) deflects\nby a small amount d with respect to straight-line propagation:\nd=\n\nL2\n= 11 m.\n2R\n\n(5.9)\n\nThis amount of deflection is smaller than the thickness of the radiation pattern induced by\na neutrino. Note that this is the deflection predicted using our best fit gradient. Because\nour measurement of the gradient is consistent with zero, the radius of curvature is also\nconsistent with infinity (zero deflection).\n\n5.7\n5.7.1\n\nDiscussion\nComparison with previous results\nKohnen [50] compiled sound speed measurements from Antarctica and Greenland.\n\nAfter applying quality selection criteria to the existing measurements, he found a simple\ndependence of both pressure wave speed and shear wave speed on temperature: vp =\n\u2212(2.30 \u00b1 0.17)T + 3795 and vs = \u2212(1.2 \u00b1 0.58)T + 1915, where vp is the pressure wave speed\n\nin m/s, vs is the shear wave speed in m/s, and T is the temperature in \u25e6 C.\n\nFigure 5.6 shows the data points compiled by Kohnen along with the new SPATS\nmeasurement reported here. Our pressure wave speed is slightly slower than the other\nmeasurements. The other measurements do not include error estimates, so it is difficult to\ndetermine whether our result is consistent with them. The other measurements were made\nwith refraction shooting, in which rays are traced from a surface explosion to a surface\nsensor, and the maximum speed below the firn is deduced by unfolding the refraction\nthrough the firn. Our in situ measurement is less susceptible to systematic effects because\nit uses unrefracted rays between sources and sensors buried in the deep fully densified ice.\nThe SPATS shear wave measurement is the first below -30 \u25e6 C. The shear wave fit\nby Kohnen was made using predictions at low temperature from the pressure speed and\nassuming temperature-independent Poisson's ratio. Our measurement agrees well with his\nprediction.\nA laboratory measurement of both pressure and shear wave speed in ice was reported recently [66]. A degassing system was used to produce a \u223c3 m3 block of bubble-free\nice in which the speeds were measured between 0 and -20 \u25e6 C. The measured speeds were\n\n\f81\n\nDepth (m)\n\n0\n100\n200\n300\n50 m\n\n100 m\n\nDepth (m)\n\n400\n0\n100\n200\n300\n150 m\n400\n0 100 200 300 400\nHorizontal distance (m)\n\n200 m\n0 100 200 300 400\nHorizontal distance (m)\n\nFigure 5.5: Calculated pressure wave ray trajectories using the measured sound speed as\na function of depth. Refraction is significant in the firn (shallower than \u223c174 m) and\nnegligible below it. Each panel shows rays emitted from a source at 50, 100, 150, or 200 m.\nRays are emitted every 10\u25e6 from vertical upward to vertical downward. The horizontally\nemitted ray is indicated by a dashed line. The Weihaupt profile is used for depths between\n0 and 174 m, and the SPATS linear best fit is used for depths between 174 and 500 m.\nAlthough the two results agree within their error bars in the region from 174-186 m depth,\nthe SPATS best fit predicts a sound speed slightly smaller than the Weihaupt results. The\ntwo curves intersect at 174 m and the SPATS fit is chosen in the overlap region so that\nthere is no kink in the velocity profile.\n\n\f82\nlarger than predicted from the Kohnen fit by \u223c50 m/s, perhaps due to the absence of\n\nbubbles or to grain orientation in the laboratory measurement.\n\nThe SPATS and Weihaupt results for pressure wave speed in South Pole firn are\nconsistent in their region of overlap. This is a valuable cross check because the two measurements use very different experimental methods and use signal frequencies that differ by\n4 orders of magnitude.\nWhile Weihaupt measured the pressure wave speed to a maximum of 186 m depth,\nall his measurements were in the firn ice (by necessity, because his measurement used waves\nthat were refracted back to the surface). We have confirmed Weihaupt's measurement in\nthe firn and extended it into the fully densified bulk ice, to a maximum depth of 500 m.\nMoreover, we have for the first time measured the shear wave speed in South Pole ice and\nhave done so both in the firn and bulk ice, at depths from 140 to 500 m depth.\n\n5.7.2\n\nImplications for neutrino astronomy and glaciology\nWe have determined that the sound speed gradient in deep South Pole ice is con-\n\nsistent with zero, and therefore that the amount of refraction of acoustic waves is consistent\nwith zero. This is in contrast with most deep ocean sites, where refraction due to a vertical\nsound speed gradient is a significant challenge for acoustic neutrino detection [1].\nOptical photons are scattered in the ice such that typical photons detected in the\nAMANDA and IceCube arrays have scattered several times, losing much of their directionality. Sophisticated algorithms have been developed to reconstruct the neutrino direction\nand energy, and the interaction location, in the presence of scattering [67]. Typically these\nalgorithms fit the full scattered waveform shape and then use the rising edge to determine\nthe arrival time of the \"direct\" unscattered photons.\nRadio waves are refracted significantly in the firn and negligibly in the deep ice.\nThe RICE experiment spans both the firn and the bulk ice and therefore must account\nfor refraction in its signal reconstruction, background rejection, and neutrino sensitivity\ndetermination. We note that while radio waves are refracted downward in the firn, acoustic\nwaves are refracted upward. This means that while surface radio noise is waveguided down\nto a possible deep detector, surface acoustic noise is refracted back to the surface, such\nthat the firn shields deep sensors from surface noise. This expectation is confirmed by the\nobservation that SPATS sensor ambient noise levels vary negligibly with time, despite the\n\n\fPressure speed (m/s)\n\n3950\n\nShear speed (m/s)\n\n83\n\n2000\n\nSPATS\nothers\n\n3900\n3850\n3800\n\u221260\n\n\u221250\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\nSPATS\nothers\n\n1980\n1960\n1940\n1920\n\u221260\n\n\u221250\n\n\u221240\n\u221230\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\nFigure 5.6: Compilation of sound speed vs. temperature in ice from different authors. Only\nfield (not laboratory) measurements are shown, and only measurements in the Greenland\nand Antarctic ice sheets (not temperate glaciers) are shown. The non-SPATS data compilation is taken from [50]. Previously the only shear wave measurements were between\n-15 and -30 \u25e6 C; SPATS has extended this to -51 \u25e6 C. The lines give Kohnen's fits, without\nre-fitting to include SPATS. The SPATS pressure wave result is slightly slower than previous results. The shear wave result matches the low-temperature prediction of Kohnen\n(made by assuming Poisson's ratio is temperature independent, predicting a shear wave\nspeed corresponding to each pressure wave speed, and fitting a straight line) very well.\n\n\f84\noperation of large construction equipment directly above the array during each South Pole\nseason [59].\nWe have shown that acoustic waves, similar to radio waves, propagate unrefracted\nin deep South Pole ice. This means the location of an acoustic source can be reconstructed\nquickly and precisely using analytical methods. Furthermore, our measurements imply that\nthe acoustic radiation pattern (like the radio radiation pattern) is affected negligibly by\nrefraction. This unique pattern (a wide, flat \"pancake\") could be used as a signature to\nseparate neutrino events from background events, which are likely to produce a spherical\nradiation pattern. The radiation pattern could also be used (along with signal arrival\ntime and amplitude) for neutrino event reconstruction. For example, the neutrino arrival\ndirection could be estimated by fitting a plane to the hit sensors; the upward normal points\nto the neutrino source [44].\nWe note that a similar array to RICE, deployed beneath the firn to avoid refraction,\nwould benefit similarly to the acoustic method from preserved radiation pattern. In fact,\ncodeploying acoustic and radio arrays in the same volume of ice could allow the two arrays\nto operate in hybrid mode, detecting a significant fraction of events in coincidence [5].\nIf both a pressure and a shear wave pulse from a neutrino are detected by a single\nacoustic sensor, the time difference between them could be used to estimate the distance\nto the source and from this the neutrino energy, with a single sensor. For distances less\nthan \u223c100 m, the precision of this reconstruction is dominated by the pulse arrival time\n\nresolution. If the timing resolution is \u223c0.1 ms, the distance resolution is \u223c1 m, independent\n\nof distance within this \"near\" regime. For distances larger than \u223c100 m, the distance\n\nreconstruction precision is limited by the precision of our sound speed measurement. Using\nthe \u223c1% sound speed measurement presented here, the distance could be determined with\n\n\u223c1% precision (that is, the distance precision scales with distance in this \"far\" regime).\n\nNow that the sound speed profile has been determined, it remains to determine the\n\nattenuation length and absolute noise level of South Pole ice, to determine its potential for\nacoustic neutrino detection. Data taking is ongoing with the SPATS array to achieve this\ngoal. Furthermore, new data taken with longer transmitter-sensor baselines could provide\nsound speed measurements with several times greater precision than presented here.\nIn addition to its neutrino astronomy applications, this measurement has glaciology\napplications. The horizontal and vertical measurements agree to better than 2%, while the\nsound speed in monocrystalline ice is known to vary by 7% with propagation direction\n\n\f85\nrelative to grain size. This indicates there is not significant grain alignment in the South\nPole fabric. Furthermore, the sound speed profile can be used to track both artificially\nproduced sounds (e.g. from explosives) and naturally occurring ones (e.g. seismic or acoustic\nemission events), both of which can contribute to our understanding of ice flow. SPATS\nis now operating in a mode to trigger on ambient impulsive transients. Such transients\nhave been detected in coincidence between multiple sensors hundreds of meters apart. The\nmechanism of these sounds is not yet understood but they could be due to stick-slip glacial\nflow at the bedrock interface or to (micro)cracks occurring in the bulk ice. Using the\nsound speed results presented here, the locations of these acoustic sources can be localized\nprecisely, information that could yield new insights into ice sheet dynamics.\n\n\f86\n\nChapter 6\n\nGaussian noise\nIn this chapter we summarize the background noise detected in the SPATS sensor channels.\nThe noise is very well described by a normal distribution, and is very stable over time.\nThese are beneficial features for operating a transient acoustic detector. We show the time\nevolution of the noise level in the sensors, both over a multi-year time period and during\nthe initial freeze in process, and show the noise distribution on each individual channel. For\nreference we tabulate the Gaussian noise parameters of each channels.\n\n6.1\n\nGaussian noise distributions (as of May 2009)\nFigure 6.1 shows a typical noise amplitude histogram. The data used are the\n\n\"monitor-noise\" stream, a data stream in which every channel is read out for 0.1 s once per\nhour, in forced mode. All noise samples from one month on one channel were combined to\nmake the amplitude histogram. The distribution is very well described by a Gaussian.\nFigures 6.2-6.5 show noise amplitude histograms for all channels of all strings. On\nStrings A, B, C, and D, there are 21+21+21+17 = 80 channels in all. As of May 2009,\nevery channel is well described by a Gaussian, with a few exceptions worth noting:\n1. AS1-2 has fat tails on both sides.\n2. AS3-0 is in saturation. Note the spikes at amplitude = \u00b12047 (the two extremes of\nthe ADC output). The small peaks at \u00b1 \u223c1300 ADC bins are interesting.\n\n3. AS3-1 and AS3-2 are Gaussian but with very large \u03c3, an order of magnitude larger\nthan on normal channels.\n\n\f87\n\nBS6\u22120 (May 2009)\n6\n\nLog10[Number of samples]\n\n5\n4\ndata\n\n3\n\nfit\n2\n1\n\n0\n\u2212200\n\n\u2212100\n\n0\n100\nAmplitude (ADC bins)\n\n200\n\nFigure 6.1: Noise amplitude histogram for an example channel, BS6-0.

channels on String D, not 21, because there is only one channel on\neach of the HADES stages (DS2 and DS6).\n\n\f92\nTable 6.1: Dead channels. The channels can be determined either by the noise amplitude\ndistribution shape, or by the amplitude of the fit to the Gaussian noise (\u03c3). Both methods\nresult in the same six channels being classified dead.\nSensor module\n\nDead channels\n\nAS3\n\n0, 1, 2\n\nCS1\n\n0, 1, 2\n\n4. BS4-2 has a fat tail, interestingly on only one side (the positive side).\n5. All 3 channels of CS1 have strange distributions. CS1-0 has a particular non-Gaussian\nshape. CS1-1 and CS1-2 also have a non-Gaussian shape, similar to one another but\ndifferent from CS1-0.\n6. The two HADES channels (DS2-2 and DS6-2) have excesses at high positive and negative amplitude. The excesses have a different shape than the fat tails in those SPATS\nchannels that have them. The fat tails are smooth deviations from the Gaussian fits\nand appear to be the normal behavior of the HADES channels.\nSix channels are considered \"dead\" and are excluded from most analyses. These\nchannels are listed in Table 6.1.\nThe parameters of the Gaussian fits to the amplitude distributions are shown for\nall channels in Table 6.2. These are the parameters of the fits shown in Figures 6.2-6.5,\nusing all data from May 2009. For each channel, both \u03bc and \u03c3 are given in ADC bins.\nNote that in the HADES modules only one channel is connected, and the other two are not\nconnected (NC). \"Dead\" channels are indicated in bold face. The set of six dead channels\n(as determined primarily from noise amplitude histogram shape) is exactly the same as the\nset of channels with Gaussian noise amplitude (\u03c3) greater than 100 ADC counts, so this\ncould have been used as the criterion to determine dead channels.\n\n6.2\n6.2.1\n\nTime evolution of Gaussian noise\nInitial noise evolution during freeze-in period\nThe Gaussian noise on each channel increased steadily after freeze-in for several\n\nweeks and then stabilized.

Channel\n0, 1, 2 is colored red, green, blue respectively. The spikes visible on top of the smoothly\nincreasing baseline are due to drilling of individual IceCube holes.\n\n\f95\nto the acoustic coupling of the modules to the bulk ice improving as the module freezes to\nthe ice and as its temperature drops to that of the surrounding ice. Figure 6.6 shows noise\nvs. time for all String D channels during the first few weeks after deployment. HADES\nchannels were operating with a gain that was too low for the data to be useful, and are not\nshown. The time that we completed String D deployment (01:14 UTC on December 24,\n2007) is shown with a vertical line. These plots show one point per run, with one run taken\nevery hour. From each run we extract a continuous recording of 0.1 s duration, sampled\nat 200 kHz sampling frequency. At least 0.1 s of data are recorded and discarded before\nselecting the 0.1 s recording to use, in order to avoid artifacts from the \"leading zeros\" ADC\nproblem. A histogram is built from the 20,000 sample amplitudes and a Gaussian curve is\nfit to the histogram as shown in Section 6.1.\nSimilar behavior was observed on Strings A, B, and C. The noise level of each\nchannel increased steadily over several weeks during the freeze-in process and then reached\na stable value for the next 1.5 (for String D) to 2.5 (for Strings A, B, and C) years until\nthe present.\nFrom freeze-in until now (a period of 1.5-2.5 years), the noise level on every channel\nhas been very stable. There is no evidence of noise variation occurring during short-term\nweather changes (storms) on the surface or during the intense periods of human activity\non the surface (using heavy construction equipment) extending from October to February\nduring IceCube construction in the austral summers.\nThere is one notable source of time variation in the Gaussian noise, which is the\nIceCube hot water drill. During construction seasons, we hear the drill go down and up\nagain in each hole that it drills. A spike is resolved by each sensor channel as it passes\nthe depth of the channel on the way down, and another spike is resolved on the way up.\nThe narrowness of this spike is interesting and may indicate directional acoustic emission\nfrom the IceCube drill. Another possible explanation is layering of the bulk ice acoustic\nproperties. But this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that we have detected acoustic\nsignals from a wide range of zenith angles from both the retrievable pinger and from frozenin SPATS sensors.\nWe do not hear any surface noise and indeed the only clear source of noise variation\nwe have seen is due to a source (the IceCube drill) below the surface, in the deep ice. This\nis in distinct contrast to ocean noise which varies strongly on multiple time scales and is\nknown to be correlated with surface wind. This could be confirmation of our expectation\n\n\f96\nthat the waveguide effect in the firn reflects surface noise back to the surface and shields\nthe deep ice from surface noise.\n\n6.2.2\n\nMulti-year noise evolution\nFigures 6.7-6.10 show the long-term evolution of the noise level on all SPATS\n\nstrings, from deployment to the present. These plots were made using the Gaussian fits\nfor each hourly run. Instead of including every run individually, the runs of each day were\naveraged together to produce a single data point for each day. The noise level is generally\nvery stable. Exceptions to this include:\n1. The noise levels slowly increase during the freezing period, asymptotically approaching\nthe stable frozen-in noise level. The time to achieve equilibrium apparently increases\nwith depth, reaching 6-12 months on the deepest modules. See for example the deepest\nString D module, where the equilibration time was \u223c12 months.\n2. In String D, which has sensors with the best signal-to-noise ratio, there is a hint of\nannual (seasonal) modulation in the noise level. Particularly in the channels with\nthe cleanest noise-vs-time behavior, there is apparently a minimum during the South\nPole summer and a maximum during the South Pole winter. It is not yet clear how\nsignificant this modulation is, or if it is a real effect in the ambient acoustic noise or\nan instrumental artifact such as variation in the surface ADC electronics. It will be\ninteresting to watch this trend over another annual cycle to see if it persists.\n3. Noise from drilling of individual IceCube holes is heard during the December-January\nannual IceCube construction season.\n4. On Strings A, B, and C, the noise behavior was more stable after January 2008 than\nbefore. In January 2008 our sensor operation protocol was changed: prior to this time\nwe powered off the sensor modules between runs; from this time to the present we\nleave the sensor modules powered on at all times.\n5. There are discontinuities when the strings are powered off, or data taking is stopped,\nfor short periods (happens only a few times per year). This is not surprising because\nwe have seen that sensors require some equilibration time to reach a stable noise\nlevel after being powered down, probably due to electronics self-heating equilibrating.\n\n\f97\n\nAS1\n\nAS2\n\n160\n\nAS3\n\n150\n\n8000\n7000\n\n120\n\n100\n\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\n140\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n80\n\n110\n\n60\nJul 07\n\n100\nJul 07\n\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n\nJan 08\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\nJan 09\n\nJul 09\n\nJan 08\n\n(a)AS1\n100\n\n115\n\n95\n\n110\n105\n100\n95\n\nJan 09\n\nJan 09\n\nJul 09\n\nJan 09\n\nJul 09\n\nAS6\n\n100\n\n90\n85\n80\n\n70\nJul 07\n\nJul 09\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\n110\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n75\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\nJan 08\n\n(c)AS3\n\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\n120\n\nJan 08\n\n0\nJul 07\n\nJul 09\n\nAS5\n\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\nJan 09\n\n(b)AS2\n\nAS4\n\n90\nJul 07\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\nJan 08\n\n(d)AS4\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\nJan 09\n\nJul 09\n\n(e)AS5\n\n60\nJul 07\n\nJan 08\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\n(f)AS6\n\nAS7\n10000\n\nGaussian noise \u03c3 (mV)\n\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n\u22122000\nJul 07\n\nJan 08\n\nJul 08\nTime\n\nJan 09\n\nJul 09\n\n(g)AS7\n\nFigure 6.7: Long-term evolution of noise level of each channel on String A.

String D deployment is indicated with a solid vertical line.\n\n\f101\nWhat is surprising is that sometimes the new steady-state noise level after power\ncycling is different from that prior to power cycling.\n6. Dead/bad channels generally fluctuate, sometimes dramatically, and often have very\nhigh output voltages (see discussion of dead/bad channels in Section 6.1).\n\n\f102\n\nChapter 7\n\nTransient events\nIn this chapter we present the acquisition and analysis of transient events with SPATS. Over\na year of high quality transients data have been acquired. We have detected both pressure\nand shear waves from individual transient events. Our offline coincidence determination\nand event reconstruction algorithms are described, and results of applying them to the data\nare presented. We clearly hear acoustic emission from recently drilled IceCube holes as well\nas from most of the large, shallow water wells drilled for use by both the IceCube drill and,\nremarkably, by the AMANDA drill. The AMANDA well was last heated nine years ago.\nWe estimate the improvement that could be achieved by upgrading from offline to online\ncoincidence and conclude that it is small.\n\n7.1\n\nInterlude: shear waves in SPATS\nAn interesting effect of acoustic studies in ice compared to water (where most\n\nprevious acoustic neutrino detection studies have been performed) is that ice can support\nshear waves in addition to pressure waves, while water can only support pressure waves.\nIt is unclear whether particle showers produce any shear waves via the thermoacoustic or\nother mechanisms, and laboratory work is underway to determine this.\nA surprising discovery that we made in the SPATS data is that both our frozen-in\ntransmitters and our retrievable pinger (operated in water-filled IceCube holes) produce\nshear waves detected in SPATS sensors. The shear wave characteristics are described in\ndetail in [51]. It is not very surprising that the frozen-in piezoelectric emitters produce a\ncomponent of shear in addition to pressure waves, via motion of the emitter relative to the\n\n\f103\nice. What is surprising is the detection of shear waves from the pinger operating in water.\nShear waves cannot propagate through fluids, so they must be produced by mode\nconversion from the pressure waves. This could occur during propagation through the bulk\nice, at grain boundaries, with small shear waves being produced throughout propagation\nof the primary pressure pulse. However these shear waves would be incoherent, occur at\nvarious times relative to the primary wave, and would likely be small amplitude and possibly\nburied in the noise.\nBecause single large-amplitude shear waves were detected in the pinger data, with\narrival times scaling with distance in a way that is consistent with emission near the same\nsource as the pressure waves, the likely explanation for shear wave production in the pinger\ndata is mode conversion at the water-ice interface (the hole wall). Such mode conversion\nis favored when a pressure wave impinges on an interface at glancing incidence, and is\nsuppressed under normal incidence. The acoustic analog of the Fresnel equations, giving\nthe transmitted and reflected amplitudes for both pressure and shear waves as a function\nof incidence angle and medium properties on both sides of the interface, are the Zoeppritz\nequations. They are described in [64].\nGiven the geometry of the pinger, the hole wall, and the sensor, there are two\nways of achieving glancing incidence and favoring shear wave production. In the horizontal\nplane (if the sensor and pinger are at the same depth), this can be achieved if the pinger\nis not centered in the hole, and/or if the hole is not exactly cylindrical. In the vertical\nplane, this can be achieved if the sensor is at a different depth than the pinger. By this\nmechanism shear waves can be produced even if the hole is cylindrical and the pinger is\nperfectly centered.\nIn the 2007-2008 season, the pinger had no centralizer and is believed to have\nbounced/swung/twisted in the hole. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the shear\nwaves were significantly suppressed in the 2008-2009 pinger data, for which the pinger was\ncentralized in the hole with brass spring ribs. Furthermore, in the 2007-2008 data there\nwas significant pulse-to-pulse variation among the nine pulses required in each nine-second\nrun. The pressure and shear wave amplitudes both varied from pulse to pulse. Moreover,\nthe amplitudes were anti-correlated, indicating that the total amount of energy was roughly\nconserved but the partitioning between transmitted pressure energy and transmitted shear\nenergy varied from pulse to pulse as the pinger swung in the hole and the angle of incidence\nchanged. This picture is consistent with that expected from the Zoeppritz equations.\n\n\f104\nTable 7.1: Time period of operation for each of the eight transients DAQ channel configurations used to date.

While we have heard pressure waves at up to \u223c1 km\n\ndistance, we have not yet heard shear waves beyond 200 m distance. This could be due\nto lower intrinsic amplitude in the shear waves, or it could be due to greater attenuation\nof the shear waves during propagation. It would be interesting to measure the shear wave\nattenuation in addition to the pressure wave attenuation that we have measured. Unfortunately we have been unable to do this so far because none of our shear wave data sets have\na sufficiently long baseline over which to distinguish attenuation from 1/r divergence.\n\n7.2\n\nTransients data taking\nOver the summer of 2008, a series of DAQ upgrades enabled SPATS to operate\n\nas a 4-string, 12-channel, high-duty transients detector. Every hour, a 45-minute run is\nexecuted simultaneously on each of the 4 strings. The run starts on the hour and finishes\n45 minutes after the hour. Three channels per string are read out, each at 200 kHz. The\nfinal 15 minutes of every hour are used for other types of data taking, including acquisition\nof raw noise recordings.\nThe strings run independently but simultaneously. Because of problems in the\nADC driver, some runs hang and need to be terminated. This happens to a few percent of\nruns.\n\n\f105\nTable 7.2: Two example channel configurations used for transient data acquisition.

Since then we have changed the configuration of channels and thresholds that we are using several times. A total of eight different configurations have been\nused. The configuration run periods are tabulated in Table 7.1. The details of two example\nconfigurations (the first configuration and the current configuration) are listed in Table 7.2.\nDuring the transient runs, each channel is triggered using a bipolar discriminator\nimplemented in software. Both a high and low threshold, in ADC counts, is specified for\neach channel. If that channel's output voltage becomes greater than or equal to the high\nthreshold, or less than or equal to the low threshold, the channel is triggered. When a\nchannel is triggered, the 1001 samples centered on the first triggering sample are written\nto disk. At 200 kHz sampling frequency, each captured waveform is of duration 5.005 ms.\n\n\f106\nAs in all runs, the waveform is time-stamped with the IRIG GPS signal online, and the\nabsolute time of the first sample of the waveform is written in the data stream. The three\nchannels per string are triggered independently.\nWhen a channel triggers, it is examined for triggers again starting with the first\nsample after the captured waveform (501 samples after the triggering sample of the captured\nwaveform). This choice ensures that many consecutive samples exceeding threshold do not\ncause individual triggers, while also ensuring that any samples meeting the trigger condition\nare written to disk in at least one event (and sometimes in two events). If a waveform is\nover threshold for a long time, it can result in many consecutive individual triggers.\n\n7.3\n7.3.1\n\nTrigger rates\nThreshold choice\nAs described earlier, the background noise on each channel is well described by\n\na normal distribution with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 (both measured in ADC\ncounts). We have determined \u03bc and \u03c3 for each channel and used it to choose high and low\ndiscriminator thresholds for that channel, corresponding to n\u03c3 from the mean. That is:\nTlow = round(\u03bc \u2212 n\u03c3)\n\n(7.1)\n\nThigh = round(\u03bc + n\u03c3),\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere Tlow is the low threshold and Thigh is the high threshold, both in ADC counts. The\nround function is used because although \u03bc and \u03c3 can take any real value, Tlow and Thigh must\nbe integers. This choice of thresholds allows us to directly choose the expected trigger rate\non each channel, such that the trigger rate is stable on each channel, the rate is consistent\nfrom channel to channel, and the number of high triggers is roughly equal to the number\nof low triggers.\nWe chose thresholds in order to trigger several times per minute per channel, or\n100-200 triggers per channel per 45-minute run. This rate was chosen to achieve \u223c100 MB\n\nof transients data per day in total for four strings, which fits safely in the daily SPATS\nbandwidth quota of 150 MB. In order to achieve this trigger rate, we chose n = 5.2 \u03c3 for\n\n\f107\nthe SPATS channels and n = 7.0\u03c3 for the HADES channels. In the following sections we\ncalculate the expected trigger rate and compare it with the actual rate.\n\n7.3.2\n\nExpected trigger rate from Gaussian noise\nIn the configuration we have used since SPATS was installed, the DAQ operates\n\non each sensor independently. If any sensor exceeds threshold, a waveform surrounding the\ntriggering sample is captured and written to disk. Analysis of coincidence between multiple\nsensor channels, and using such coincidence to perform source position and emission time\nreconstruction, is then performed offline.\nWith such a trigger we can calculate the expected trigger rate, under the hypothesis\nof Gaussian-only noise, as follows.\nThe probability of choosing a value x from a normal distribution (\u03bc, \u03c3) that is less\nthan x0 is given by the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution,\nP (x < x0 ) =\n\n1\nx0 \u2212 \u03bc\n[1 + erf[ \u221a ]],\n2\n\u03c3 2\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere erf is the error function. This function approaches 1 as x0 approaches \u221e, and it\n\napproaches 0 as x0 approaches \u2212\u221e. From this we can determine the probability that x is\ngreater than x0 :\n\nP (x > x0 ) = 1 \u2212 P (x < x0 ) =\n\nx0 \u2212 \u03bc\n1\n[1 \u2212 erf[ \u221a ]].\n2\n\u03c3 2\n\n(7.4)\n\nNext we can substitute our high threshold, Thigh , to determine the probability that\nany individual sample of the Gaussian noise is greater than it:\nP (x > \u03bc + n\u03c3) =\n\n1\nn\n[1 \u2212 erf[ \u221a ]],\n2\n2\n\n(7.5)\n\nand similarly we can calculate the probability that any sample is less than the low threshold:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\nP (x < \u03bc \u2212 n\u03c3) = [1 + erf[\u2212n 2]] = [1 \u2212 erf[n 2]],\n2\n2\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that the error function is odd. The result is that the probability\nof triggering high is equal to the probability of triggering low, as expected from the symmetry\nof the Gaussian distribution and our choice of thresholds centered on the DC offset.\n\n\f108\nThe probability of any one sample triggering is the sum of the probability of\ntriggering low and the probability of triggering high:\nn\n(7.7)\nP = 1 \u2212 erf[ \u221a ].\n2\nFinally, the trigger rate R is given by scaling this by the sampling frequency f :\nn\nR = f P = f (1 \u2212 erf[ \u221a ]).\n(7.8)\n2\nFor our choice n = 5.2\u03c3 used for SPATS channels, the probability of any one\nsample triggering is p = 1.99 x 10\u22127 . The single-channel trigger rate is 0.0399 Hz, or 2.39\nevents per minute. In each 45-minute run, we expect 108 events per channel, or \u223c1290\n\nevents for all 12 channels summed over 4 strings. At 2.089 kB per event, the expected data\nrate is 64.7 MB per day from transient runs, summed over all four strings.\n\n7.3.3\n\nActual trigger rate\nFigure 7.1 shows the number of triggers per run vs. time of day for all channels\n\non August 28, 2009, and Figure 7.2 shows the same plot for May 15, 2009. Several points\nare worth noting. First, the rate is very stable on each channel. This is a significant benefit\nof the Gaussianity of the noise distribution on each channel. It is a very different situation\nfrom hydrophone arrays in water, for example, where the noise level varies on multiple time\nscales and so do the trigger rates, unless sophisticated adaptive threshold algorithms are\nused [1, 4]. Second, the rate is consistent from channel to channel. This is the benefit\nof choosing channel-dependent thresholds of \u00b1n\u03c3 relative to the channel-dependent mean.\n\nThird, the trigger rate is comparable to that expected from Gaussian statistics.\n\nThe actual trigger rate is \u223c200 triggers per channel per run, compared with the\n\nexpected rate of \u223c100 triggers per channel per run from Gaussian statistics as estimated\n\nabove. The excess raises our typical daily data rate for transients data from \u223c65 MB per\nday to \u223c130 MB per day, still safely within our daily \u223c150 MB quota. There are several\n\npossible contributions to the discrepancy between the actual trigger rate and that expected\nfrom the Gaussian noise estimate:\n1. Non-Gaussianity of the background noise amplitude distribution.\n\n\f109\n\nString B\n250\n\n230\n\n240\nEvents per run per channel\n\nEvents per run per channel\n\nString A\n240\n\n220\n210\n200\n190\n180\n170\n\nAS6\u22120\nAS5\u22121\n\n160\n\nAS4\u22122\n\n150\n00\n\n03\n\n230\n\nBS6\u22120\n\n220\n\nBS5\u22121\nBS6\u22122\n\n210\n200\n190\n180\n170\n\n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\nHour of run on Aug 28 2008 (UTC)\n\n21\n\n160\n00\n\n00\n\n03\n\n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\nHour of run on Aug 28 2008 (UTC)\n\n(a)\nString C\n\n21\n\n00\n\nString D\n600\n\nEvents per run per channel\n\n220\nEvents per run per channel\n\n00\n\n(b)\n\n230\n\nCS6\u22120\n\n210\n\nCS5\u22121\n200\n\nCS4\u22122\n\n190\n180\n170\n\n500\nDS4\u22120\n400\n\nDS3\u22121\nDS2\u22122\n\n300\n200\n100\n\n160\n150\n00\n\n21\n\n03\n\n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\nHour of run on Aug 28 2008 (UTC)\n\n(c)\n\n21\n\n00\n\n0\n00\n\n03\n\n06\n09\n12\n15\n18\nHour of run on Aug 28 2008 (UTC)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 7.1: Number of triggered events per run vs. start time of run, for each channel of\neach string on August 28, 2008.

Variation in the Gaussian \u03bc and \u03c3 with respect to the values assumed in choosing the\ntrigger thresholds.\n3. Non-Gaussian impulsive transients (actual transient \"signals\" above the noise).\nFinally, while the trigger rate on each channel is stable over a long time scale, there\nare some clear differences between the rates in August 2008 and May 2009. In particular,\nin August 2008 the rates were more consistent from channel to channel, and in May 2009\nthere is more channel-to-channel variation in the trigger rates. This is likely because the\nGaussian noise \u03bc and \u03c3 have drifted slightly over many months, while we have not changed\nthe trigger thresholds over the same time period.\nThe hypothesis that the observed slow drift in trigger rates is due to slow drift in\nGaussian noise parameters can be tested with a calculation. As an example we consider\nchannel CS5-1, for which the mean trigger rate (in events per run) increased from 194 on\nAugust 28, 2008 to 288 on May 15, 2009. During this time period, the Gaussian noise\nof the channel did in fact drift slightly higher, such that the actual (low, high) thresholds\n(measured in number of \u03c3 from \u03bc) were (-5.20, +5.23) on August 28 but were (-5.13, 5.10)\non May 15. The thresholds were originally chosen to be at (-5.2, +5.2). The expected\nnumber of triggers per run for pure Gaussian noise is 108 events per run for a threshold of\n(-5.2, +5.2) and 183 events per run for a threshold of (-5.1, +5.1). For both time periods,\nthe difference between the actual and the expected Gaussian-only trigger rate is likely due\nto genuine non-Gaussian impulsive signal events above the noise. The conclusion is that for\nthis example time period, the trigger rate increased roughly by the proportion expected,\nin the same time period that the Gaussian noise increased while the absolute thresholds\nremained fixed.\nIf precisely stable event rates are necessary, the thresholds can be updated to\nmatch drifting Gaussian noise parameters every \u223cmonth. However, the drift is small and\n\nthere are also benefits of having absolute voltage thresholds that are constant over multiple\nmonths.\n\n7.4\n\nNoise hit cleaning with sample multiplicity cut\nBefore applying a coincidence requirement, we introduced a \"sample multiplicity\"\n\ncut. The purpose of this cut is to reduce the effect of noise hits. Most of our triggers\n\n\f112\nare \"Gaussian tail\" events in which a single sample fluctuated high in the Gaussian tails.\nThese events compose the Gaussian-only expected rate described above. For real acoustic\ntransients, we expect a coherent signal with a clear waveform shape different from the\nGaussian noise recordings in which each sample amplitude is independent of the others.\nExcept for events very close to threshold where we likely cannot distinguish them from\nnoise in any case, the real acoustic transients should have more than one sample meeting\nthe bipolar discriminator trigger requirement. Therefore for each event we count the number\nof samples passing the trigger (the \"sample multiplicity\") and require it to be greater than\none.\nThis cut reduces the rate of Gaussian noise hits by several orders of magnitude,\nwhile presumably having a small effect on real acoustic transients. The Gaussian noise\nrejection factor is estimated as follows. Whenever there is a trigger, the DAQ records 1001\nsamples from the triggering channel, centered on the first sample sample to meet the trigger\nrequirement. First we consider an arbitrary recording of 1001 samples (not necessarily one\nthat passed the trigger). Given an arbitrary recording of n = 1001 samples, we assume that\nif the recording is a Gaussian noise capture then all the samples are independent. Each\nsample has a probability p = 1.99 x 10\u22127 of meeting the trigger requirement, as shown in\nsection 7.3.2. The probability that exactly k of the n samples match the trigger requirement\nis given by the binomial distribution:\n\u0012 \u0013\nn k\nP (k) =\np (1 \u2212 p)n\u2212k .\nk\n\n(7.9)\n\nThis equation is plotted in Figure 7.3. Note that increasing k by 1 decreases the\nprobability of occurrence dramatically. In the general case,\nP (k + 1)\np n\u2212k\n=\n.\nP (k)\n1\u2212pk+1\n\n(7.10)\n\nFor our particular values of p and n, increasing k by 1 decreases the probability of occurrence\nby four orders of magnitude.\nTwo particular probabilities are worth calculating for what follows (we are assuming p << 1).\nP (0) = 1 \u2212 np;\n\n(7.11)\n\n\f113\nRecording of 1001 samples\n\nLog10[Prob. that k samples trigger]\n\n0\n\n\u22125\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221215\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221225\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nk\n\nFigure 7.3: For an arbitrary recording of n = 1001 independent noise samples, the probability that exactly k of them pass the trigger condition is given by the binomial distribution.\nWe have assumed the probability that any particular sample triggers is p = 1.99 x 10\u22127 , as\nis expected under our trigger conditions.\n\nP (1) = (np)[1 \u2212 p(n \u2212 1)].\n\n(7.12)\n\nWe are interested in the probability that two samples trigger in a single capture,\ngiven that one sample has triggered. First recall Bayes' Theorem:\nP (A)\n.\n(7.13)\nP (B)\nUsing this we can determine the probability that 2 or more samples pass the trigger, given\nP (A|B) = P (B|A)\n\nthat 1 or more samples pass the trigger:\n\nP (k \u2265 2|k \u2265 1) = P (k \u2265 1|k \u2265 2)\n\n1 \u2212 P (0) \u2212 P (1)\nP (k \u2265 2)\n=\n= p(n \u2212 1).\nP (k \u2265 1)\nP (0)\n\n(7.14)\n\nWe can cross-check this with another method. Given that the center sample in\nthe captured waveform of n = 1001 samples passed the trigger, what is the chance that at\nleast one of the remaining n \u2212 1 samples passed the trigger? It is the complement of the\n\nprobability that zero samples passed the trigger. Then using Equation 7.9, it is\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nn\u22121 0\np (1 \u2212 p)n\u22121\u22120 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)n\u22121 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p(n \u2212 1)) = p(n \u2212 1),\n0\n\n(7.15)\n\n\f114\nwhich is the same answer we got using the first method.\nFor our values of p and n, this gives a probability of 1.99 x 10\u22124 . This is the\nfraction of triggered events that have more than 1 sample passing the trigger, under the\nhypothesis that all samples are independently selected from the same Gaussian amplitude\ndistribution. That is, requiring at least two samples to pass the trigger condition for each\ntriggered waveform reduces the rate of Gaussian tail events by a factor of \u223c2 x 10\u22124 .\n\n7.5\n\nMulti-channel coincidence\nProcessing was performed offline to determine multi-channel coincidence clusters.\n\nFor each hour, it was first required that runs from all 4 strings were present. A small fraction\nof hours are excluded by this requirement because some runs are halted prematurely due\nto a hanging ADC driver. When this happens the runs are terminated by the DAQ and\ndeleted.\nThe DAQ executes one transients run per string per hour. Each run produces a\nsingle file. The maximum file size is \u223c34 MB (compressed) and occurs when the trigger rate\n\nis so high that it fills the 100 MB RAM disk with the file (before compression). A trigger\n\nrate orders of magnitude larger than typical is necessary to cause such a saturated run.\nWhen these runs occur the data are retained, but the run terminates as soon as the disk\nfills and therefore the run has an abnormally short duration. To avoid these saturated runs,\nonly runs of size < 10 MB were included. This requirement also improves offline processing\nbecause large runs take longer to process.\nOnly hours with all four single-string runs present were considered for further\nanalysis. For each hour, the runs from the four strings are merged and sorted to produce\na time-ordered list of single-channel triggers. Next the sample multiplicity cut described\nabove is applied. Finally, a coincidence window is applied to determine \"clusters\" of singlechannel triggers that could be causally related. A coincidence window of length 200 ms\nis used. The maximum distance between sensors in the 4-string SPATS array is 686 m\n(between CS1 and DS7). At 3878 m/s, these sensors are separated by 177 ms. The extra\n13% buffer achieved by using 200 ms allows for refraction and finite time resolution.\nFor each time-ordered list of single-channel triggers, one per hour, we loop over\nevents in the list to determine coincidence clusters. For each event i, we determine if any\nother events occurred within 200 ms after event i. If any did, we add them to a \"cluster\"\n\n\f115\nand search for any other events occurring within 200 ms of those events. The cluster is\nextended until there are no more events within 200 ms after the last event in the cluster.\nEach single-channel event belongs to either one cluster or no cluster. This algorithm ensures\nthat any two events within 200 ms are members of the same cluster. The duration of the\ncluster can in principle be much longer than 200 ms if the trigger rate is high, with the\nfirst and last events in the cluster separated by much more than 200 ms. But this happens\nrarely due to our very low trigger rate (\u223c0.07 events per channel per second without the\nsample multiplicity cut, and much lower with it).\nNext, we restrict the cluster by including only the first trigger on each sensor\nmodule: we only include the first hit at a given channel, and if two different channels of the\nsame module are hit, we only include the first hit. All other hits are ignored. This solves\nthree problems: multiple triggering on a single long pulse arriving at a single channel; shear\nwaves causing two pulses arriving at a single channel; and degeneracies in the reconstruction\nalgorithm due to including two hits at two channels of the same module, which occur at\nnearly the same time and the same location with respect to other modules and therefore do\nnot contribute independently to vertex reconstruction due to the small distance (\u223c10 cm)\nseparating channels of the same module.\nFor event reconstruction, we require that at least 3 strings were hit. This is because\nwhile 3 or 4 strings allows good vertex reconstruction, the 3D vertex cannot be determined\nif only 1 or 2 strings are hit (no matter how many modules on them are hit). If 1 string is\nhit, the source can only be constrained to a circle around the string. If only 2 strings are\nhit, the source can only be constrained to two points, mirror images of one another about\nthe plane defined by the two strings.\nFinally, we require that at least 5 modules are hit in the cluster in order to reconstruct it. The cuts used in transients analysis are summarized in Table 7.3.\n\n7.6\n\nReconstruction of source location and time\nConsider a signal emitted by a source at location r0 , at emission time t0 . Assume\n\nthe signal propagation speed is c and is homogeneous and isotropic throughout the propagation medium. The signal is detected by n receivers. The signal arrives at receiver i with\nlocation ri at time ti , i = 1...n. The challenge is to solve for (t0 , r0 ), given (ti , ri ).\nThis is a common problem with applications including: localization of emergency\n\n\f116\nTable 7.3: Parameters used in transients analysis.

A class of solutions uses the differences\nin arrival times at the various receivers, and is known as the \"time difference of arrival\"\n(TDOA) technique. The value of time differences of arrival follows from the fact that, while\nthe propagation time from the source to the receivers is not directly known, the differences\nbetween them are.\nIn three dimensions, any pair of receivers constrains the source to a hyperboloid,\nsymmetric about the axis between the two receivers. Adding a third receiver adds a second\nhyperboloid, whose intersection with the first hyperboloid is generally a curve. Adding\na fourth receiver (third hyperboloid) generally results in two point-like solutions. A fifth\nreceiver (fourth hyperboloid) is generally necessary to distinguish between the two solutions,\nas emphasized in [68]. However in some cases there is only one solution, and in many\ncases where there are two solutions one is unphysical, for example lying far outside the\ninstrumented volume.\nIf the propagation speed is homogeneous and isotropic, the problem can be solved\nanalytically as described in [69]. The solution is determined by first writing down the\npropagation equation, di = c\u2206ti , for each receiver. The system of n equations is linearized\nto a system of n \u2212 1 equations by subtracting off the equation for the first hit receiver. The\n\n\f117\nsystem can then be written as a matrix equation and solved robustly using singular value\ndecomposition (SVD). One benefit of this approach is that the n receivers are all treated on\nthe same footing, even if there are much more than 5 of them. The emission time is solved\nsimultaneously with the vertex position and both are determined with a direct analytical\nequation. No iterating over subsets of the n receivers, as is done by other algorithms, is\nnecessary.\nThis method can be further improved by subtracting the average equation, rather\nthan the first equation, from the system, as demonstrated in [70]. This method retains n\nequations rather than n \u2212 1 and can find unique solutions in many (but not all) cases where\nn = 4.\n\nWith SPATS we are currently reading out sensors between 250 m and 400 m depth,\nwhere we have measured the sound speed to be highly independent of depth. The analytical\nalgorithms therefore perform well, as long as the source is also deeper than \u223c200 m. For\n\nshallower sources, refraction in the firn (upper \u223c200 m of ice, which is still converting\n\nfrom snow and is less dense than the fully dense ice below) should be included. Unlike\nthe analytical, invertible problem described above, this is an inverse problem that must\nbe solved numerically. An algorithm that solves it was demonstrated in [1] and should\nwork well for SPATS. To begin with, however, we use the simpler and faster algorithm that\nrequires at least 5 receivers and is described in [69]. We have implemented this algorithm\nin MATLAB, and for events with 12 receivers hit it can reconstruct 3,000 events per second\non a 1.8 GHz Dual Core AMD Opteron 265.\nWhile the sample multiplicity cut described above rejects many of the noise hits,\nsome noise hits remain and cause false vertex localization. Refraction also causes systematic\nmis-reconstruction, an effect that is worst for sources in the firn and is worse for shallow\nevents than deep events within the firn. Because of these two effects, we introduced a final\nquality parameter defined as follows:\nv\nu n\nu1 X\n\u03c4 =t\n(ti \u2212 texpected\n)2 ,\ni\nn\n\n(7.16)\n\ni=1\n\nis the\nwhere ti is the actual experimental arrival time at sensor module i, and texpected\ni\nexpected arrival time under the hypothesis that the acoustic signal was emitted at the time\nand location given by the vertex reconstruction algorithm, and propagated at constant c to\n\n\f118\nthe receiver. This quality parameter \u03c4 is simply the root-mean-square of the time residuals\nof the actual arrival times with respect to the expected arrival times under the hypothesis\nof homogeneous c = 3878 m/s. For an event to be considered well-reconstructed, we require\n\u03c4 < 10 ms. This is a rather conservative cut designed to retain most events that have been\naffected by refraction, while rejecting events whose expected times dramatically mismatch\nthe actual times due to the presence of noise hits.\n\n7.7\n\nResults of transient source reconstruction\nWe ran the coincidence determination and event reconstruction algorithm descried\n\nabove on the full set of transients data collected to date (August 2008 - September 2009).\nBasic statistics of the data set are described in Table 7.4. During the South Pole summer\nseason (Nov-Feb), the live time for transients acquisition is reduced due to other types of\ndata taking such as pinger runs. However after this time period the duty cycle is stable\nat \u223c70%. In standard data taking, 25% of the live time is used for other types of data\ntaking such as raw noise recordings. The remaining 5% corresponds to time periods in\nwhich transient acquisition was running but all four strings did not contribute complete\ntransient runs, due to the ADC hanging problem (see Section 4.4.1).\nFigure 7.4 shows the layout of IceCube and SPATS during 2009. All 59 IceCube\nstrings deployed and operating during 2009 are shown. The 19 that were deployed in the\n2008-2009 season are colored red. Finally, the five Rodriguez, or \"Rod\" wells, are marked\nwith diamonds and labeled by season. Four of the Rod wells were drilled for IceCube, and\none was drilled for AMANDA.\nFigures 7.5-7.8 show the (x, y) distribution of reconstructed transient source locations for each of the 14 months of data taking. Figure 7.9 shows the (x, y) distribution of\nall transient vertex reconstructions for the entire 14-month run period. We clearly detect\nacoustic emission from both AMANDA and IceCube Rod wells, as well as from the IceCube\nholes themselves.\n\n7.7.1\n\nDetection of acoustic emission from AMANDA and IceCube Rodriguez wells\nA Rodriguez (\"Rod\") well is typically drilled at the beginning of each IceCube\n\nconstruction season (in November). A narrow (\u223c0.6 m diameter) hole is drilled to a depth\n\n\f119\n\nTable 7.4: Summary of transient event statistics. \"Runs\" includes all single-string runs\nfor the month, including those without 4 strings running at once and those with file size\n>10 MB. \"Good hrs\" is the total number of hours for which all four strings are present\nand have file size <10 MB. \"Live fraction\" is the total fraction of time in the month for\nwhich \"good\" transient runs were occurring, defined to be (45 minutes live per hour) / (60\nminutes) x (number of complete hours) / (number of hours in the month). The number of\nvertices after applying the \u03c4 cut is given, followed in parentheses by the number of vertices\nbefore applying the \u03c4 cut. Stable data taking began at the end of August 2008, so that\nmonth is incomplete. The run period considered in this analysis is 00:00 UTC on August 30,\n2008 through 23:45 UTC on September 30, 2009. The rate of transient events is gradually\ndecreasing, likely due to the Rod wells becoming quieter as their freeze-in proceeds. The\ntotal number of good hours analyzed is 8,013, corresponding to 250.4 days of live time given\nthat there are 45 minutes of live time per good hour.\nMonth\n\nRuns\n\nGood hrs\n\nLive fraction\n\nVertices\n\nVertices/hr\n\nAug 08\n\n143\n\n24\n\n-\n\n30 (43)\n\n1.25\n\nSep 08\n\n2,670\n\n623\n\n65%\n\n1028 (1333)\n\n1.65\n\nOct 08\n\n2,825\n\n655\n\n66%\n\n1158 (1445)\n\n4.54\n\nNov 08\n\n2,354\n\n484\n\n50%\n\n754 (927)\n\n1.56\n\nDec 08\n\n2,244\n\n411\n\n41%\n\n459 (618)\n\n1.12\n\nJan 09\n\n2,712\n\n571\n\n58%\n\n722 (940)\n\n1.26\n\nFeb 09\n\n2,626\n\n566\n\n63%\n\n260 (380)\n\n0.46\n\nMar 09\n\n2,814\n\n661\n\n67%\n\n349 (485)\n\n0.53\n\nApr 09\n\n2,749\n\n644\n\n67%\n\n361 (476)\n\n0.56\n\nMay 09\n\n2,781\n\n648\n\n65%\n\n292 (363)\n\n0.45\n\nJun 09\n\n2,837\n\n677\n\n71%\n\n53 (53)\n\n0.08\n\nJul 09\n\n2,928\n\n696\n\n70%\n\n71 (71)\n\n0.10\n\nAug 09\n\n2,920\n\n691\n\n70%\n\n79 (81)\n\n0.11\n\nSep 09\n\n2,817\n\n662\n\n69%\n\n62 (62)\n\n0.09\n\nTotal\n\n35,420\n\n8,013\n\n-\n\n5,678\n\n-\n\n\f120\n\n600\n\nA (78)\nB (72)\n\nD (76)\n400\n07\u221208\n\n06\u221207\n\ny (m)\n\n200\n\nC (47)\n99\u221200 04\u221206\n\n0\n\u2212200\n08\u221209\n\u2212400\n\u2212600\n\u2212600\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n\n0\nx (m)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nFigure 7.4: The 59-string IceCube configuration, in operation in 2009.

A heater is lowered to the bottom of the well and used to\n\ncreate a cavern of diameter \u223c15 m, i.e. a bulb at the bottom of the long neck. This well\n\nis used as a source for the heated and circulated water used by the IceCube hot water drill\nsystem. Another well of the same type, located close to the new South Pole Station, is used\nas the water source for all other purposes at the station.\nAs the season progresses, the well sinks deeper due to the ice below the well melting\nas a result of continuous heat input from the submerged heater. By the end of the season\nthe well is typically \u223c60-80 m deep. At this time the well consists of a long, narrow neck\n\ncapping a large bulb. For example, the 2007-2008 well shape is estimated to be as follows:\nneck of diameter \u223c0.6 m down to a depth of \u223c45 m, at which point it gradually widens,\nreaching \u223c16 m diameter at its deepest point (\u223c61.5 m). For each IceCube hole, \u223c20,000\n\ngallons of water are extracted from the Rod well. At the end of each season, the bulb has a\nlayer of water at the bottom, with a cavern of air on the top of the bulb and air filling the\nneck to the surface.\nAs can be seen in Figures 7.5-7.7, we clearly detect the IceCube Rod wells as\npoint-like acoustic emitters. A surprising fact is that we still hear Rod wells several years\n1\n\nThanks to Jeff Cherwinka and Jonas Kalin for providing the Rod well size and shape estimates given in\nthis section.\n\n\f125\n\n5678 vertices between 30\u2212Aug\u22122008 and 30\u2212Sep\u22122009\n600\nA (78)\nD (76)\nB (72)\n400\n\ny (m)\n\n200\n\nC (47)\n\n0\n\u2212200\n\u2212400\n\u2212600\n\u2212600\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212200\n\n0\nx (m)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nFigure 7.9: All 5,678 vertices reconstructed over the \u223c14-month run period.

For comparison, the IceTop tanks\n(water tanks comprising a surface air shower detector component of IceCube) of size \u223c1 m\n\ntake several months to freeze. Moreover, even after the water in the Rod wells has frozen,\nwe expect there to be a significant over-density that could take a long time to relieve and\ncould cause acoustic emission from cracking events.\nRod wells were also used for the AMANDA drill. The last AMANDA Rod well\nwas last heated during the 1999-2000 season. This well is located in the middle of the\nAMANDA array, near the 2004-2006 IceCube Rod well. Although these two sources are\nnear one another, two individual clusters of acoustic emission vertices can be resolved in\nthe SPATS data. It is remarkable that not only the oldest IceCube Rod well, last heated in\n2006, but also the last AMANDA Rod well, last heated in 2000, is still producing significant\nacoustic emission after nine years.\nWhile we have detected four of the five Rod wells, some contribute significantly\nhigher event rates than others. This is likely due to a combination of geometry (distance\nfrom SPATS strings) and volume of water left to freeze in the wells. The properties of each\nwell are as follows:\n1. 1999-2000 (AMANDA) well: The amount of water left in the well at the end of the\ndrilling season was medium to large.\n2. 2004-2006 well: A single well was used for both the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 seasons.\nThis well is likely deeper than others due to this re-use. It is expected to be very deep\nbut not very wide, with \u223c50,000 gallons of water remaining at the end of use.\n3. 2006-2007 well: Estimated to have been left with a moderate amount of water, maybe\nsimilar to the 2004-2006 well. This well was relatively deep and narrow.\n4. 2007-2008 well: This well was left with a very large amount of water, \u223c120,000 gallons\n\nor more. This is consistent with the fact that we observe many more acoustic emission\nevents from this well than from other wells. The well diameter was \u223c15 \u00b1 2 m. Six\ndays prior to the end of drilling, the well depth was 67 m and the water surface was\nat 61.5 m depth.\n\n5. 2008-2009 well: This well was left with very little water, \u223c10,000-15,000 gallons. This\nis consistent with the fact that we have not observed any acoustic events from this\n\n\f127\nwell, although the non-observation of acoustic emission could also be due to the large\ndistance of this well from SPATS sensors. At the end of the season, the diameter of\nthe Rod well bulb (as a function of depth) ranged between 6 and 17 m, with a mean\nof \u223c12 m. The final depth was 75.5 m and the final water surface was at 73 m depth.\n\n7.7.2\n\nDetection of acoustic emission from IceCube holes\nIn addition to the Rod wells, we clearly detected acoustic emission from many\n\n(more than half) of the IceCube holes that were drilled in the 2008-2009 IceCube construction season. Unlike the Rod wells, which have emitted over the many months we have been\nrunning our transients data acquisition, emission from each IceCube hole started typically\nfive days after drilling of the hole, and decreased after \u223ctwo weeks. This indicates that,\n\nlike the Rod wells, we hear the re-freeze process in the IceCube holes. The IceCube holes\nare much narrower than the bulbs in the IceCube holes so it is not surprising that their\nemission occurs over a shorter time period.\nFor the most part we hear transient events from the IceCube holes during their\nre-freeze phase, and do not hear transient emission from them while they are being drilled.\nInstead, we hear the IceCube drill itself, as it goes down and up in each hole, as a Gaussian\nnoise level increase, but generally we do not hear associated transient events. An exception to this is that for a single hole we have seen several transient events whose vertex\nreconstruction corresponds in space and time with the IceCube drill.\n\n7.7.3\n\n\"Smearing\" reconstruction artifact due to not including refraction\nin reconstruction\nAs can be seen in the transient vertex distributions, each source is smeared along a\n\nline relative to the point-like (in (x, y)) source expected. This is an artifact of not accounting\nfor refraction through the firn in the source reconstruction. Although the sensors being\nread out are deeper than the firn, much of the detected emission originates in the firn.\nIn particular, the Rod wells are only \u223c70 m deep, where the sound speed is significantly\nsmaller than in the deep bulk ice. A more accurate reconstruction algorithm would account\nfor refraction through the firn and is expected to remove the smearing artifact.\nOur hypothesis that the smearing is an artifact due to not including refraction\nhas been confirmed by Jens Berdermann (at DESY Zeuthen), who simulated vertical lines\n\n\f128\nof sources (point-like in (x, y) but with a range of z values) with and without including\nrefraction to determine \"true\" Monte Carlo propagation times. In each case an algorithm\nassuming zero refraction was used to reconstruct the sources. In the case with no refraction\nincluded in the true times, point-like (x, y) reconstructed source distributions were achieved.\nBut in the case where refraction was included in the calculation of the true travel times\nbut was not included in the reconstruction algorithm, the smearing effect seen in real South\nPole data was reproduced.\nThis smearing effect is therefore expected to be removed by applying a reconstruction algorithm that accounts for refraction. Such an algorithm was successfully applied in\nanalysis of SAUND data [1] and should be applied to SPATS data. Similar to the South\nPole data, we observed strange distributions in the SAUND data when refraction was not\nincluded, whereas the distributions were reasonable when refraction was included.\n\n7.8\n\nDetection of shear waves from transient events\nWe have detected shear waves from some of the background transient events. A\n\nsearch was performed by first reconstructing the vertices as described above (using the first\nhit per module). Because the coincidence algorithm automatically extends the time window\nas long as there are still hits within 200 ms of the last hit, shear waves are included in the\ncoincidence cluster determination as long as the source is within a few hundred m of the\nsensor. Because we only include the first hit per module, any detected shear waves are\nneglected in the currently used reconstruction algorithm. But we can search for shear wave\nhits after reconstruction by plotting arrival time vs. distance from reconstructed vertex, for\nall hits in a coincidence cluster.\nExamples of such plots are shown in Figures 7.10-7.13. In each plot, pressure waves\nare expected to lie on the steeper line, and shear wave pulses are expected to lie on the\nshallower line. For this study we focus on coincidence events from June 2009 with at least\n11 channels hit (out of 12 being read out). Most such events come from the region of the\n2004-2006 Rod well. The figures demonstrate that the detected events lie in four classes:\nshear detected on 0, 1, or 2 channels, or ambiguous shear detection due to long-duration\npressure emission which extends beyond the expected start time for shear emission.\nShear wave hits can be used to improve source position and time reconstruction.\nThey can also be used to improve event characterization for distinguishing neutrino sig-\n\n\f129\n\n06\u2212Jun\u22122009 05:09:42: vertex at (439, 107, \u2212138) m\nP expected\nS expected\nhit\n\nModule distance from vertex (m)\n\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\u2212200\n\u2212400\n\u22120.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\nTime since emission (s)\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nFigure 7.10: Distance to reconstructed vertex, versus time since reconstructed emission, for\nhits of a single coincidence cluster.

For example, if the thermoacoustic effect can be proven to\nnot produce shear waves, then the presence of shear emission in an event identifies it as\nbackground.\n\n7.9\n\nExpected threshold improvement with online coincidence\nMany detector arrays operate with multi-channel coincidence required online. For\n\nexample, both the SAUND and the HESS experiments have performed upgrades from offline\nto online coincidence. The rate of mutli-channel coincidence is lower than the rate of singlechannel events, so a lower threshold can be achieved for a fixed data rate. Another benefit\nof online coincidence is that the whole array (including non-triggering channels) can be\nread out when a trigger occurs. If the rate of noise triggers in the coincidence time window\nis small, then requiring multiple channels to be hit in this time window can provide a\nsignificant threshold improvement. However, if the rate of noise triggers in the coincidence\nwindow is large, then requiring coincidence does not provide a significant benefit.\nSuch an upgrade, from offline to online coincidence, could be applied to the SPATS\nDAQ. However, we show here that such an upgrade would only achieve a small threshold\nimprovement (15%).\nWe assume that such an online coincidence trigger would require 3 strings to be\nhit in a time window of 200 ms. We also assume that whenever a trigger occurs, we read out\nall 12 channels currently being read out for transient data acquisition. We also assume that\nthe same number of samples (1001) would be captured per channel, and that the amount\nof disk space required per event per channel would be the same as it is currently for offline\ncoincidence.\nIf a single channel on string S exceeds threshold (call this hit h), we require that\nat least one channel on each of at least two other strings (the two strings must be other\nthan S) also trigger within 200 ms after hit h. Let c be the probability that any particular\nchannel triggers in a 200 ms time window. For a sampling frequency f and time window t,\nthere are N = f t samples in the time window. In our case, f = 200 kHz and t = 200 ms,\nso N = 4 x 104 . Assume that the probability of any particular sample triggering is p. In\nSection 7.3.2 we calculated p as a function of the trigger threshold for Gaussian noise. The\n\n\f132\nprobability of a particular channel triggering in a time window t is then\nc = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)N .\n\n(7.17)\n\nFor s = 1.99e-7 and N = 4 x 104 , c = 7.94 x 10\u22123 . This is the probability that a\nparticular channel triggers in our 200 ms time window. Now let P be the probability that\nat least one channel out of three on a string trigger in the time window. It is given by\nP = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c)3 .\n\n(7.18)\n\n.\nFor our current settings, this is P = 2.36 x 10\u22122 . This is the probability that a\nparticular string is hit in our time window. Now we require that at least two strings other\nthan S are hit. This is given by\nG = 3P 2 \u2212 2P 3\n\n(7.19)\n\nFor our numbers, this gives G = 1.65 x 10\u22123 . Any time a particular channel\nexceeds threshold, G is the probability that we meet the global online coincidence trigger\nrequirement. This whole calculation assumes Gaussian noise triggers dominate.\nNow assume we read out all 12 channels any time the global trigger is satisfied.\nThis means that for the current DAQ settings, switching from offline to online coincidence\nwould lower the data rate by a factor of 12G = 1.98 x 10\u22122 . Alternatively, for a fixed\ndata rate, we can use this factor of \u223c50 to lower our threshold. This would raise the\nsingle-channel trigger rate by a factor of 50 while maintaining the same total data rate.\n\nSwitching from a threshold of 5.2\u03c3 to 4.42\u03c3 would give the desired factor of 50 increase in\nsingle-channel trigger rate. This is an improvement of 1 \u2212 4.42/5.2 = 15%.\n\n\f133\n\nChapter 8\n\nMeasurement of acoustic\nattenuation length\nIn this chapter we present our measurement of the acoustic attenuation length. We summarize results obtained from another analysis using pinger data, then give details of an analysis\nusing inter-string data. The conclusion from these two analyses, as well as others, is that\nthe attenuation is more than an order of magnitude larger than expected from theoretical\nestimates.\n\n8.1\n8.1.1\n\nInventory of data available for attenuation measurement\nInter-string\nThis was the methodology for which SPATS was originally designed. SPATS\n\nfrozen-in transmitters are recorded with frozen-in sensors on different strings. With the\nfirst three strings, the available baselines were insufficient to overcome the large systematic\nuncertainties, which motivated construction and deployment of String D. With String D,\nalong with improvements in data taking and processing (especially clock drift correction),\ninter-string signals can be detected between many transmitter-sensor combinations, and an\nattenuation measurement can be made. Data selection cuts are described below, but to\nsummarize: considering only horizontal propagation paths, high-quality inter-string recordings are available at depths of 100 m, 140 m, 190 m, 250 m, 320 m, 400 m. Unfortunately\nno data are available for the 80 m level, because it is controlled by a different ADC board\n\n\f134\nfrom the others, for which we have not (yet) developed the necessary DAQ software. We\ndescribe the inter-string attenuation analysis in detail below.\n\n8.1.2\n\nPinger\nIn the 2007-2008 pinger data taking campaign, data were taken for all 9 instru-\n\nmented SPATS depths. Unfortunately the pinger was swinging/bouncing/twisting significantly, and recordings by the same channel of the pinger operating in different IceCube\nholes produced irreproducible waveforms. This was improved significantly with the addition of centralizers for the 2008-2009 pinger data taking. The 2008-2009 pinger data have\nallowed our best determination of the attenuation length, and the data are much better for\nthis than the 2007-2008 data. However for this data taking campaign we focused on our\nbest five instrumented depths: 190 m, 250 m, 320 m, 400 m, and 500 m. Therefore we only\nhave good information about the depth dependence of the attenuation in this depth range.\nIt may be possible to extract a rough estimate from the 2007-2008 data, and a pinger campaign is planned for the 2009-2010 season to pin down the depth and frequency dependence\nof the attenuation. The pinger attenuation results are described in detail in [47] and [71].\n\n8.1.3\n\nGaussian and transient noise sources\nThe IceCube drill noise is heard as an increase in the Gaussian noise level as the\n\ndrill approaches a given SPATS sensor channel in depth. The noise then decreases as the\ndrill proceeds deeper. The drill is heard again, and recedes again, as the drill passes the\ndepth of the channel again on the way back up. Assuming the emitted drill noise is isotropic,\nthese data can be used to estimate the attenuation length.\nImpulsive transients can also be used to estimate the attenuation length. For\nexample, if a single transient event is observed by several sensors separated by hundreds of\nmeters, the transient source location can be reconstructed and studying the amplitude vs.\ndistance can then be used to constrain the attenuation length. An alternative method is\nto study the distribution of sources in space: for example if the distribution of background\nevents were homogeneous, and a cutoff in the observed rate were observed as a function\nof distance from the SPATS sensors, this could also be used to constrain the attenuation\nlength.\nBoth of these analyses are in progress.\n\n\f135\n\n8.2\n\nPinger attenuation measurement\nWe have used several methods to estimate the amount by which ice attenuates\n\nacoustic signals. We analyzed each of the following types of data to estimate the attenuation\nlength: Gaussian noise from the IceCube drill, inter-string data, pinger data, transients data.\nI focus on the results from the inter-string analysis, which has been my personal analysis\nfocus.\nParallel analyses were performed with the retrievable pinger, and are described\nin [71, 47]. The most successful pinger analysis used the data from the 4 pinger deployments\nof the 2008-2009 season. The 6 pinger deployments of the 2007-2008 season were not as\nuseful. The 2008-2009 data were of significantly higher quality for two reasons: (1) the\nrepetition rate was increased from 1 Hz to 10 Hz (except for one of the 2008-2009 pinger\ndeployments, for which the repetition rate was accidentally set to 8 Hz), which increased\n\u221a\nthe signal-to-noise ratio by 10 after waveform averaging; and (2) centralizing ribs were\nadded to the pinger assembly to prevent the swinging/bouncing/twisting motion that caused\nsignificant pulse-to-pulse variation in the 2007-2008 data.\nThe acoustic attenuation length was measured with better than 30% precision\nusing the following method, details of which are given in [47]. For each sensor channel,\npinger runs recorded at the same level in all 4 different pinger deployment holes were\nconsidered. For each, the pressure wave energy and effective amplitude were determined.\nThen the attenuation length \u03bb, as well as an overall normalization factor b, was fit for each\nsensor channel independently. The resulting independent estimates of \u03bb were consistent\nwith one another, and systematic effects were dramatically reduced because only one sensor\nchannel was used for each fit and because the 4 pinger holes lay roughly along a single line\nof sight as seen from the SPATS strings, such that azimuthal effects in both the sensors and\npinger were reduced. The b quantity fit for each channel constitutes an in situ estimate of\nits relative sensitivity.\n\n8.3\n8.3.1\n\nInter-string attenuation measurement\nData set\nSeveral different inter-string data sets were acquired with different parameters.\n\nSeveral iterations in data taking and analysis were taken over a two-year period as we\n\n\f136\nimproved both data taking and analysis techniques. Here I focus on the most recent (and\nmost useful) data set.\nFor this most recent data set, two data acquisition software upgrades were performed. First, the software was upgraded so that only one clock per string was used for\nall data taking, including both transmitter pulsing and sensor recording. Although each\nADC/DAC board has its own clock, a \"SyncBus\" connection allows the clock of any board\nto drive acquisition on another board or boards on the same String PC. We took advantage of this to use the first board on each string to control all boards on the string, so\nthat acquisition among the different boards (corresponding to different sensor channels)\nwas synchronous and only one clock's drift had to be monitored on each string.\nThe second upgrade was to record one channel of the sensor that is on the same\nstage as the firing transmitter. In addition to providing a useful \"intra-stage\" recording of\nthe transmitter signal at very close (<1 m) range, this includes a recording of the IRIG-B\nGPS signal in order to monitor the clock drift on the transmitting string.\nData were recorded for each transmitter recorded by each sensor in the SPATS\narray. In each run, one transmitter was pulsed with a 25 Hz repetition period for 40 s. All\ninter-string transmitter-sensor combinations were collected over a two-day period (April 1-2,\n2009). The transmitters are known to require several seconds to reach steady pulse-to-pulse\nperformance, likely due to self-heating of the electronics during initial operation followed\nby temperature equilibration. The pulse amplitude is initially somewhat larger than in the\nsteady state and then decays to the steady-state amplitude with a time constant of \u223c2 s.\n\nTo be sure we are recording in the steady state, we start the sensor recording 11 s after the\ntransmitter begins pulsing. In each run, all three channels of a single sensor module are\nrecorded continuously for 20 s, enough time to record 500 transmitter pulses. The three\nchannels are sampled synchronously, at 200 kilosamples per second on each channel.\n\n8.3.2\n\nSelection of transmitter-sensor combinations\nWe designed SPATS with many transmitters and sensors, for two purposes: relia-\n\nbility and redundancy. We did not know how much of the instrumentation would perform\nsufficiently well to be used for different analyses, particularly for the attenuation analysis\nwhich we knew would be most important. Furthermore, we did not know which systematic\neffects would be important. At first we attempted to combine all possible inter-string com-\n\n\f137\nbinations from a transmitter on one string to a sensor on another string. Results of this\nfirst analysis are reported in [72]. However, this analysis method suffers from the following\neffect: Given an arbitrary transmitter on one string and sensor on a different string, those\nfor which the transmitter and sensor are at different depths (\"diagonal\" paths) tend to be\nlonger than those for which the transmitter and sensor are at the same depth (\"horizontal\"\npaths). Stated another way, for inter-string combinations in the SPATS array geometry,\nboth the transmitter emission angle and the sensor arrival angle are correlated with the\ntransmitter-sensor distance. The transmitters are known to emit more in their equatorial\nplane that at diagonal angles, and the sensors are known to be more sensitive in the horizontal plane than for diagonal arrival angles. Taken together, these facts mean that the signal\nrecorded for diagonal paths (which tend to be longer than horizontal paths) are systematically smaller than for horizontal paths, due to the angular response of both transmitters and\nsensors. Because of the systematic correlation between path length and emission or arrival\nangle, measuring amplitude vs. distance is degenerate with measuring amplitude vs. zenith\nangle at sensor or transmitter. Instead of mapping out the attenuation of the length, we are\nmapping out the angular response of our sensors and transmitters if we include diagonal as\nwell as horizontal paths.\nBecause of this effect, we chose not to include diagonal transmitter-sensor paths\nand instead focused on single-depth, horizontal paths.\nThis analysis uses a single transmitter recorded by all sensor channels at the same\ndepth as the transmitter. A single transmitter is used because the different transmitters\nare known to have different inherent transmittivity and perhaps different coupling to the\nice with respect to one another. For each transmitter we perform a complete attenuation\nanalysis using all sensor channels as the same depth as the transmitter. We then repeat\nthis analysis for each transmitter (allowing transmittivity to be a free overall normalization\nconstant in the fits, different from transmitter module to module) and finally combine all\nattenuation results from all transmitters.\n\n8.3.3\n\nSensor and transmitter clock drift correction\nFor each sensor channel, the 500 consecutive pulses are averaged together to im-\n\nprove the signal-to-noise ratio. Each string uses a single clock to drive both its analogto-digital converters (ADC's) and its digital-to-analog converters (DAC's). The ADC's are\n\n\f138\n\n55 runs: \u22122.60538e\u221206 +/\u2212 2.3%\n\n\u22126\n\nx 10\n\n\u22122.45\n\u22122.5\n\u22122.55\n\u22122.6\n\u22122.65\n\u22122.7\n\u22122.75\n\n09:36\n10:48\n12:00\n13:12\n14:24\n15:36\nString A run start time on Apr 01 2009 (UTC)\n\n69 runs: \u22122.10643e\u221206 +/\u2212 2.5%\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22121.9\nDrift rate = (actual freq)/(nominal freq)\u22121\n\nDrift rate = (actual freq)/(nominal freq)\u22121\n\n\u22122.4\n\nx 10\n\n\u22121.95\n\u22122\n\u22122.05\n\u22122.1\n\u22122.15\n\u22122.2\n\u22122.25\n\n09:36\n12:00\n14:24\nString B run start time on Apr 02 2009 (UTC)\n\n(a)\n\u22127\n\nx 10\n\n43 runs: \u22125.1942e\u221207 +/\u2212 16.6%\n\n\u22124\n\u22124.5\n\u22125\n\u22125.5\n\u22126\n\u22126.5\n\u22127\n12:00\n\n\u22126\n\n1.12\nDrift rate = (actual freq)/(nominal freq)\u22121\n\nDrift rate = (actual freq)/(nominal freq)\u22121\n\n\u22123.5\n\n(b)\nx 10\n\n63 runs: 1.03377e\u221206 +/\u2212 1.3%\n\n1.1\n1.08\n1.06\n1.04\n1.02\n\n13:12\n14:24\n15:36\nString C run start time on Apr 01 2009 (UTC)\n\n(c)\n\n1\n12:00\n\n13:12\n14:24\nString D run start time on Apr 02 2009 (UTC)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 8.1: Drift rate vs. time for each of the 4 clocks (one per string) in the inter-string\ndata-taking campaign of April 1-2, 2009 (UTC). The drift rate was determined every time\nthe transmitter was run. Over the two-day data taking period, the drift rate on each string\nwas stable at the few-percent level, with the exception of String C. On String C the drift\nrate was small, so the absolute variation of the rate was small even though the relative\nvariation was larger than a few percent (16.6%). For each string we take the mean of the\ndrift rate measurements as an estimate of the drift rate for the entire data-taking period\nand use it for the inter-string attenuation analysis.\n\n\f139\nused to record the sensor waveforms, and the DAC's are used to pulse the transmitters. The\nclocks drift at a rate that is typically several parts per million, or tens of \u03bcs over the course\nof the 20 s waveform recording. This cumulative amount of drift is on the order of one signal\noscillation period and therefore can cause severe decoherence in the pulse averaging if the\nnominal rather than true sampling frequency is used. This clock drift effect is corrected\non the sensor side by using the IRIG-B GPS signal (which is recorded synchronously with\neach sensor channel recording) to determine the actual sampling frequency at the time of\nthe recording. This actual sampling frequency (which differs from the nominal sampling\nfrequency by several parts per million) is used in the pulse averaging.\nWe also must correct for the clock drift on the transmitting string. The drift\ncauses the actual transmitter repetition rate to be different from the nominal repetition\nrate by a few parts per million. Similar to the effect on the sensing string, this effect would\ncause decoherence by an amount on the order of a signal oscillation period, resulting in\ndestructive interference in the pulse averaging, if not accounted for. The actual repetition\nrate was measured for each run using IRIG-B GPS signals recorded on the transmitting\nstring while it was transmitting, by using the sensor recorded at the same stage as the\ntransmitter and applying the same drift determination algorithm as used for the sensing\nstring. The true repetition rate varied from string to string but was constant on each string\nat the few-percent level over the course of the two-day data taking campaign, as shown in\nFigure 8.1. Therefore the mean value of the transmitter repetition rate for each string was\nused in the pulse averaging.\n\n8.3.4\n\nWaveform averaging and signal pulse stability\nTo average the pulses, the actual (after drift correction) times of all samples in the\n\nrecording were wrapped in time modulo the repetition period. Each set of 250 consecutive\nsamples (one-half the number of pulses) was then grouped together to form one bin. In\neach bin the mean and standard deviation amplitude were then determined. This algorithm\nresults in a mean waveform with an effective sampling frequency twice as large as that used\nonline (because the number of points per bin is half of the total number of pulses, so the time\nbetween bins is half of the online sampling time). In addition to the mean, the uncertainty\nof each sample amplitude is estimated by this algorithm and is simply the standard error\n\u221a\nof the mean (standard deviation divided by 250) for each bin.

The time axis is centered with the maximum-amplitude\nsample at t = 0, and time is wrapped modulo the repetition rate (roughly 40 ms; the precise\nactual period accounting for clock drift is used). The pulse at t = 0 is the pressure wave,\nand the smaller pulse is the shear wave. In this example a shear wave is visible at a time\nof 31.0 ms after the pressure wave (equivalent to 9.0 ms before the pressure wave, modulo\n40 ms), as expected. The time window used for integration of the pressure wave signal is\nindicated with vertical lines. It begins 5 ms before the maximum-amplitude sample and\nends 26 ms after the maximum-amplitude sample.

Each waveform is centered on the\nmaximum-amplitude sample. The top row is String A; the middle row is String B; and\nthe bottom row is String C. The channels are ordered 0, 1, 2 from left to right. Each\nwaveform shows a well determined signal shape well above noise. The shape is, however,\nsignificantly different from channel to channel. This is due to both the azimuthal variation\nof the transmitter output, and the differing characteristic (resonant) response of each sensor\nchannel.\n\n\f143\nthe mean is used because the noise is stable and Gaussian, and therefore the mean of the\nGaussian can be determined with a precision greater than the width of the Gaussian by\n\u221a\n250.\nAn example average waveform is shown in Figure 8.2. The errors shown are statistical only and are the standard error of the mean from the waveform averaging procedure.\nThe small statistical errors indicate that the clock drift correction and waveform averaging\nalgorithms perform well. The errors include three components: pulse-to-pulse variation in\nthe signal, pulse-to-pulse variation in the noise, and residual clock drift. The pulse-to-pulse\nvariation in the signal waveform amplitude and shape is evidently very small. Moreover, the\npulse shape and amplitude are reproducible from run to run, as shown in Figure 8.3. The\nstatistical uncertainty on each waveform's shape and amplitude (including all three components) is small. That is, the voltage waveform is well-determined. This is the waveform\nas output by the sensor. What is more uncertain is the original acoustic pressure waveform (both the shape and the amplitude), before it is convolved with the sensor response\nwhich has both frequency and angular (both polar and azimuthal) dependence. This is the\ndominant systematic uncertainty and is addressed below.\nThe ratio between pressure and shear wave amplitude varies with transmittersensor configuration, but the shear waves are always lower amplitude than the pressure\nwaves.\nAlthough the pulses are very stable from run to run and pulse to pulse on a single\nsensor channel, the shape and amplitude differ significantly from channel to channel, as\nshown in Figure 8.4.\n\n8.3.5\n\nNoise stability\nThe acoustic noise conditions at South Pole have been determined by SPATS to\n\nbe very stable [59]. In particular we checked that they were very stable during the two-day\ninter-string data taking campaign. Several raw noise runs were recorded on each channel,\ninterspersed among the transmitter recordings, by recording with the same sampling frequency and duration but with no transmitter pulsing. The noise runs were processed with\nthe same waveform averaging algorithm as the transmitter runs. An example average noise\nrecording is shown in Figure 8.5. For each noise run, after waveform averaging the mean\namplitude (DC offset, \u03bc) and the standard deviation of the noise samples (\u03c3) was calcu-\n\n\f144\n\nDT0 to AS6\u22120 (Run 509487, 090402 12:54 UTC)\n15\nDC = \u22124.38 and std. = 4.66 for 16000 samples\n10\n\nAmplitude (mV)\n\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\u221210\n\u221215\n\u221220\n\u221225\n0\n\n10\n20\n30\nTime modulo 39.999959 (ms)\n\n40\n\nFigure 8.5: Example \"T0\" (noise) recording, which has been processed using drift correction\nand waveform averaging in the same way as for waveforms with a real transmitter pulsing.\nThe mean and standard deviation for the run are shown. Noise recordings like this were\nused to subtract the noise in the inter-string attenuation analysis\n\n\f145\nlated. Each of \u03bc and \u03c3, on each sensor channel, was stable at the few-percent level during\nthe two-day period.\n\n8.3.6\n\nWindowing\nFor each average waveform, in order to measure the signal amplitude or energy\n\ncontent we need to apply a time window in order to select the pressure wave signal and\nseparate it from the shear wave signal. The signal content often extends well beyond the\nmaximum-amplitude sample, so it is necessary to include as large a window as possible while\navoiding shear wave contamination. For the inter-string data set there are three possible\nwindowing algorithms:\n1. Full window (no windowing). This is the easiest choice but it suffers from shear wave\ncontamination.\n2. Dead-reckoning using emission and arrival times. This is in principle the best algorithm, but it requires a difficult sequence of steps to determine the emission time and\nfrom that to calculate the expected arrival times of both pressure and shear waves,\nwhen their separation, the repetition rate, and the times of flight are all on the order of tens of ms and the delay from the beginning of the transmitter firing to the\nbeginning of the sensor recording is on the order of 10 s. While the accounting is\nstraightforward for the pinger which has emission at a known time driven directly by\na GPS clock, it is difficult for the inter-string data where the transmitter emission\ntime is asynchronous and can occur at any time relative to GPS absolute time. While\npossible in principle, this is a difficult and unnecessary algorithm.\n3. Fixed-width windowing based on peak amplitude. This is the algorithm we use for this\nanalysis. From studying the timing and amplitude of pressure and shear waves in the\ninter-string data, we know that shear waves are always lower amplitude than pressure\nwaves. Therefore we can use the maximum amplitude of the average waveform to\ndetermine the pressure wave time. We then open a time window starting 5 ms before,\nand ending 26 ms after (chosen by visually inspecting all runs), this peak amplitude.\nBecause we only detect shear waves in the inter-string data for the nearest-neighbor\nstring combinations (String A and to String B and vice versa), this windowing is\n\n\f146\nsufficient to include all of the pressure signal while excluding all of the shear signal,\nfor all transmitter-sensor distances.\nAn example of the windowing algorithm applied to an average waveform is shown\nin Figure 8.2. For all average waveforms used in this analysis, the waveforms were examined\nby eye to verify that the windowing algorithm fully included the pressure wave while fully\nexcluding the shear wave.\n\n8.3.7\n\nSignal energy and effective amplitude\nBecause the waveform shape varies from channel to channel and we combine nine\n\ndifferent channels to fit for the attenuation length, the peak-to-peak amplitude is a bad\nchoice of amplitude estimate: it is sensitive to variation in the resonant behavior of the\nsensor. A better metric, which is not as sensitive to shape variation but is still dependent\non an overall sensitivity normalization, is the energy in the signal. Here we use energy in\nthe signal processing definition (sum of squared sample amplitudes, in arbitrary units), not\nin the physics sense (which would be proportional to the signal processing definition but\nnormalized correctly to give the physical energy in the electrical or acoustic pulse).\nFirst the total energy in the window-restricted waveform (including both signal\nand noise) was determined as\nES+N =\n\nn\nX\n\nVi2 ,\n\n(8.1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere n is the number of samples in the restricted time window, and Vi is the mean voltage\nof the ith sample. We include only the n samples inside the restricted time window. With\nthe window of width 31 ms described above, and effective sampling frequency of the average\nwaveform of 400 kHz, the number of samples in the restricted time window is n = 12,400\nfor all runs.\nNext the amount of noise energy present in the average waveform (within the\nrestricted time window) was calculated as\nEN = n(\u03bc2 + \u03c3 2 ).\n\n(8.2)\n\nThe first term in this equation is the noise contribution from the DC offset, and the second\nterm is the contribution from the standard deviation of the noise. The noise was subtracted\n\n\f147\nto estimate the amount of pressure signal energy in the restricted time window:\nES = ES+N \u2212 EN .\n\n(8.3)\n\nFinally, the \"effective amplitude\"\nA=\n\np\n\nES\n\n(8.4)\n\nwas introduced in order to directly fit for the amplitude attenuation coefficient rather than\nthe energy attenuation coefficient. The statistical uncertainty of the effective amplitude\nwas determined with standard error propagation using the statistical uncertainty of each\nmean waveform sample and of \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\n8.3.8\n\nRun selection\nThe algorithm described above was applied to every inter-string run to determine\n\nan effective pressure signal amplitude A, along with the statistical uncertainty of it, \u03b4A.\nThe statistical uncertainty is dominated by the effect of the random Gaussian background\n\u221a\nnoise varying from pulse to pulse. Although the noise is reduced by a factor of 250\nby the waveform averaging algorithm, for some transmitter-sensor combinations the signal\namplitude is nevertheless small enough that the signal is swamped by noise.\nFor attenuation analysis, in order to only include transmitter-sensor combinations\nwith signal-to-noise ratio sufficiently large to be sure that we are determining the transmitter\namplitude correctly and not just measuring a noise fluctuation, we required that the effective\namplitude signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = A/\u03b4A be larger than 5. This was chosen by visually\ninspecting waveforms: all waveforms with SNR larger than 5 had clear coherent waveform\npulses, while some waveforms with SNR as large as e.g. 4.8 had waveforms that were\ndifficult to distinguish from noise by visual inspection. After applying this SNR cut, there\nwere 93 unique transmitter-sensor combinations surviving.\nFor many transmitter-sensor combinations, more than one run was recorded as\na consistency check. These runs were used to verify that the average waveforms were\nreproducible in both amplitude and shape, as described above. For such combinations with\nmultiple runs taken, only the first run was used for attenuation analysis.\n\n\f148\n\n8.3.9\n\nFitting for attenuation\nThe waveform shape for each transmitter - sensor channel combination depends\n\non both the transmitter and the sensor channel. This is because both the transmitter and\nsensor resonate, and the resonance behavior of each transmitter and sensor is unique. In\naddition to the shape variation from transmitter to transmitter and sensor to sensor, there is\namplitude variation. That is, each transmitter has different transmittivity, and each sensor\nhas different sensitivity. Here we use a single transmitter for each analysis, but multiple\nsensor channels. Therefore in fitting for the attenuation length, the transmittivity is fit as\npart of an overall normalization factor that we do not care about, while the variation in\nsensitivity from channel to channel produces our dominant systematic uncertainty.\nFor each transmitter there are typically three sensor modules, each with three\nchannels, at the same depth on other strings. The acoustic attenuation was measured for\neach transmitter in the array, after applying the following two selection cuts to the data.\nFirst, the SNR > 5 cut described above was applied. Second, there had to be at least one\ngood channel at each of at least two distances from the transmitter, at the same depth as\nthe transmitter, in order for a fit to be performed for a given transmitter. Note that in the\nSPATS array geometry, only five of the nine instrumented depths are instrumented on all\nfour strings. 12 of the 28 SPATS transmitters met these selection criteria.\nFor each good sensor channel, the quantity\ny = ln(Ad)\n\n(8.5)\n\nwas calculated, where A is the effective amplitude in Volts and d is the transmitter-sensor\ndistance in meters. We then applied a linear fit for each of the 12 transmitters, using the\nmodel\ny = \u2212\u03b1d + b,\n\n(8.6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the acoustic attenuation coefficient in m\u22121 and b is a free normalization parameter\nrelated to the emission strength of the transmitter. Linear regression was applied to directly\ndetermine the best fit and uncertainty on each of the two parameters \u03b1 and b.\nBoth statistical and systematic uncertainty were included in the y value for each\nchannel recording each transmitter. The statistical contribution was determined with error\npropagation from the statistical uncertainty of the effective amplitude. The systematic\n\n\f149\n45 channels: mean = 8.69 and standard deviation = 0.86\n15\n\nCount\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\nBest\u2212fit b from single\u2212channel pinger analysis\n\n10\n\nFigure 8.6: Sensor sensitivity values from in situ calibration with pinger. The histogram\nshows the best-fit b values (b is the offset in the linear attenuation fit) for the 45 attenuation\nanalyses, one per channel, in the pinger analysis.\nuncertainty is dominated by the unknown relative sensitivity of the sensor channels. The\nsensitivity of each channel is defined to be the response function converting acoustic pressure\namplitude into electrical voltage amplitude. We estimate the sensor channel-to-channel\nvariation in sensitivity by treating the retrievable pinger results as an in situ calibration of\nthe sensor channels. Because the pinger analysis fits for the b parameter for each channel\nindependently, eb can be taken as a measure of the sensitivity of each channel.\n\n8.3.10\n\nSensor sensitivity systematics\nFor each sensor channel recording, the effective amplitude A and its statistical\n\nuncertainty \u03b4A were determined as described above. It is also necessary to estimate the\nsystematic uncertainty of A. As described above, we measure the attenuation length with\nthe inter-string data by performing multiple fits, each using a single transmitter and multiple\nsensor channels at the same depth. This method requires the sensitivity (conversion factor\nfrom pressure to voltage) of the different channels to be roughly equivalent, and the extent\nto which this is false must be included as a systematic uncertainty.\n\n\f150\n\n45 channels: mean = 7847 and standard deviation = 5368\n12\n10\n\nCount\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nChannel \"sensitivity\" = exp(Best\u2212fit b)\n\n2.5\n4\nx 10\n\nFigure 8.7: Sensor sensitivity values from in situ calibration with pinger (eb parameter).\nHistogram of eb for the 45 attenuation analyses, one per channel, in the pinger analysis. eb\nis a measure of the relative sensitivity of each channel.\n\n\f151\nBy taking the ensemble of all fitted b parameters for all channels we can estimate\nthe variation in the channel sensitivities. Figure 8.6 shows a histogram of the 45 fitted b\nparameters from the pinger analysis [47]. To convert this into relative sensitivity, we need\nto consider eb for each channel, as shown in Figure 8.7. The standard deviation of the eb\nmeasurements is 68% of the mean of the eb measurements. More directly, because we are\nusing the result of a fit in log space for another fit in log space, we can use the standard\ndeviation of the best-fit b values measured in the pinger analysis, which is 0.86.\nThe sensitivity is in general direction-dependent for each sensor channel. Because\nall retrievable pinger recordings were taken from nearly the same direction in azimuth, this\nis a reliable measurement of each channel sensitivity in the direction of the pinger. The\ninter-string recordings, in contrast, are taken from a wide range of azimuths. However,\nwe do not need to know the absolute value of each channel sensitivity for the inter-string\nanalyses; we only need to know the channel-to-channel variation which we take as a measure\nof the systematic uncertainty of each channel sensitivity. We assume that the variation in\nsensitivities measured in the pinger direction is a good estimate for other directions also.\nTherefore we take 0.86 as the systematic uncertainty on y for each of the channels in the\ninter-string analysis. This is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty of y for each\nchannel.\n\n8.3.11\n\nSummary of inter-string attenuation results\nAn example fit for the String D transmitter at 320 m depth is shown in Figure 8.8.\n\nResults of the 12 fits for the 12 transmitters are compiled in Figure 8.9. For each transmitter\ni, the best fit attenuation coefficient \u03b1i and uncertainty \u03c3i are shown. Many of the singletransmitter fits individually give a result consistent with zero attenuation. However, the\n12 results can be combined to improve the precision of the measurement. Determining the\nweighted mean of the measurements in the standard way (weighting by 1/\u03c3i2 ) gives a global\nbest fit \u03b1 =3.16 \u00b1 1.05 km\u22121 .

We conclude with some thoughts\non the outlook for acoustic neutrino detection in ice.\n\n9.1\n9.1.1\n\nAchievements to date\nThe story of SPATS\nWe started several years ago with sensor development neutrino sensitivity simu-\n\nlations, and a goal of hybrid GZK neutrino detection that required us to first determine\nthe acoustic properties of South Pole ice, similar to AMANDA's need to determine the\noptical properties of the ice in its early days. We started designing a project to make the\nnecessary measurements, SPATS, on napkins at the Berkeley collaboration in the spring of\n2005. Successful deployment of SPATS followed 18 months later with the installation of\nStrings A, B, and C in January 2007.\nWhile we learned a lot about noise conditions and made the first sound speed\nmeasurements with these strings, large systematic effects due to the unknown absolute,\nangular, and frequency responses of our sensors and transmitters, combined with the relatively short baselines available with the first three strings, prevented us from determining\nthe attenuation length. We installed a fourth string, String D, in the 2007-2008 South Pole\nseason, and we also operated a retrievable pinger in six water-filled IceCube holes. The\nnew string gave us more and longer baselines as well as improved sensors and transmitters.\n\n\f155\nThe retrievable pinger provided an interesting mystery: secondary waves detected under\nsome but not all pinger-sensor geometries. After thinking for some time that the secondary\nwaves were reflections, we realized they were shear waves and simultaneously understood\nthe smaller but also mysterious secondary waves we had seen in the inter-string data as\nshear waves. The data from the first season of pinger operation (with pinger Version 1)\nwere valuable for measuring the sound speed vs. depth of both shear waves and pressure\nwaves. However, both the first season of pinger data and the new four-string inter-string\ndata were insufficient to determine the attenuation length.\nIn the 2008-2009 season we deployed an improved pinger in four IceCube holes.\nThe pinger had an order of magnitude larger repetition rate and mechanical centralizers to\nprevent the motion of the pinger, which had caused severe variation in the pinger signal\nduring the first season. This new pinger data allowed us to determine the attenuation\nlength for the first time, and with good precision. Simultaneously, progress in accounting\nfor clock drift and optimizations in the data acquisition software allowed us to estimate\nthe attenuation length with four-string inter-string data taken in the spring of 2009. In\nthe summer of 2008 we also upgraded the data acquisition software to acquire high-quality\nmulti-channel background transient events, which have been successfully reconstructed.\nBy systematically addressing each of the challenges in our data from one year to\nthe next, and responding to each of them in successive South Pole seasons, we have now\ncompleted nearly all of our measurement goals with SPATS.\n\n9.1.2\n\nSound speed\nWe measured the sound speed as a function of depth, for both pressure and shear\n\nwaves, between 80 m and 500 m depth, with better than 1% precision. Our measurements\nare compatible with others where they overlap, and we have measured the pressure wave\nspeed for the first time beneath the firn and the shear wave speed for the first time at\nSouth Pole. Most importantly for neutrino detection, we showed that at depths below the\nfirn the level of refraction is small and therefore not a challenge to event reconstruction.\nThe results, our first complete analysis with SPATS, have been submitted to the Journal\nof Geophysical research.\n\n\f156\n\n9.1.3\n\nAttenuation length\nWe have measured the attenuation length to be 300 m \u00b1 100 m. The amount of\n\nattenuation is more than an order of magnitude larger than theoretical predictions. This\nshould be understood both because it is an interesting scientific question and because it will\nhelp us determine whether acoustic neutrino detection is still feasible. We emphasize that\nneutrino sensitivity does not scale directly with attenuation length, because 1/r divergence\nas well as the energy-dependent conversion of neutrino energy to acoustic radiation need to\nbe considered. Monte Carlo simulations are necessary to accurately estimate the neutrino\nsensitivity of a possible array. These simulations can be performed with more confidence\nnow that we have an experimental measurement of the attenuation length, rather than\nrelying on theoretical predictions as we did previously.\nDetermining the attenuation dependence on depth and frequency will help distinguish different theoretical models of the attenuation mechanism, and will determine if there\nis a favorable part of the (depth, frequency) phase space for neutrino detection. Although\nwork is underway on both topics, so far we cannot distinguish any depth or frequency\ndependence with the existing data.\nA paper on our attenuation length results is in preparation.\n\n9.1.4\n\nNoise floor\nWe have measured the noise floor to be very Gaussian, to be very stable with\n\ntime, and to decrease with increasing depth. The noise level in each channel has been\nstable over a \u223c2 year period, and in particular is not correlated with weather or human\nactivity on the surface. Each of these features is encouraging for neutrino detection, and is\n\nin contrast to liquid water environments where other neutrino detection studies have been\nperformed. The Gaussianity of the noise causes our trigger rates to be stable and predictable\nwith Gaussian statistics, where the Gaussian-tail events cause the bulk of triggers, and\nimpulsive transient events contribute a small additional component. Liquid water sites,\nin contradiction, typically have noise conditions that vary on multiple scales in both time\nand space, resulting in unstable trigger rates and/or the necessity of sophisticated adaptive\nthreshold algorithms.\nThe absolute noise level decreases with increasing depth. We predicted this before\ndeploying SPATS, under the hypothesis that the effect is caused by the waveguide effect\n\n\f157\nof surface noise being refracted back to the surface (toward lower wave propagation speed)\ndue to the sounds speed gradient in the firn. The SPATS sensors were initially calibrated\nonly in water, and now they are deployed in ice at low temperature and high pressure.\nThe response to temperature and pressure have now been characterized in the lab, but it\nremains to perform an absolute calibration in ice. Unfortunately it will not be possible to\nachieve a simultaneous calibration at high pressure, at low temperature, and in ice. Instead\nit will be necessary to assume that these three properties affect the response independently.\nWe are working to calibrate the sensor response as well as possible in ice. This will allow\nus to estimate the absolute noise level as a function of depth in South Pole ice. The noise\nlevel determines the neutrino energy threshold, given a particular sensor array geometry.\n\n9.1.5\n\nTransients\nThe stability and Gaussianity of the noise have allowed stable and reliable acqui-\n\nsition of transient background events. We have run with \u223c70% livetime since August 2008,\n\naccumulating more than 200 days of high-quality livetime reading out three sensor channels\nper string on each of our four strings. We can reconstruct the emission time and location\nof these events and have found several interesting features after doing so. Four of the five\nIceCube drill \"Rodriguez\" wells are present as strong and steady sources, as is an AMANDA\nRod well last heated nine years ago. Moreover, the individual IceCube holes drilled in December 2008 and January 2009 appeared as sources of transient acoustic noises, beginning\nemission \u223c5 days after drilling. The bulk of the emission is therefore associated with the\n\nre-freeze of the holes. For one hole close to SPATS, we also see some events during the\nactual drilling of the hole.\nWe do not see any events (from IceCube holes or Rodriguez wells) deeper than\n\u223c300 m. This is a mystery because we are reading out sensors both above and below this\n\ndepth. This could be due to variation in the ice properties, but a simpler explanation is\nthat the detected source distribution matches the intrinsic emission distribution. If this\nis true then acoustic emission is strongest at shallow depths and decreases with increasing\ndepth, perhaps due to the increasing ambient pressure.\n\nThe discovery and study of these sources has been a valuable verification of our full\nchain of hardware, online data acquisition software, and offline processing and reconstruction\nsoftware. The Rod wells and IceCube holes have served as useful calibration sources. It\n\n\f158\nis fortuitous that we upgraded the DAQ for this data in 2008, because the Rod wells have\nnow quieted down considerably, and we could only hear the nearest of the IceCube holes\nthat were drilled in December 2008 and January 2009. Many of the 2008-2009 holes will be\ndrilled farther from SPATS and it will likely be more difficult to hear them.\n\n9.2\n\nAttenuation: reconciling theory and experiment\nThe measured attenuation length of \u223c300 m is shorter than the theoretical expec-\n\ntation by more than an order of magnitude. We are considering several possible mechanisms\nfor this:\n1. The original theory presented in [8] evaluated attenuation as the sum of contributions\nfrom scattering and absorption. In the range of frequencies relevant to acoustic waves\nproduced by ultrahigh-energy neutrino cascades ( 10 to 80 kHz), scattering was\ndominated by Rayleigh scattering off of ice grain boundaries, with a fourth power\ndependence on frequency and third power dependence on diameter. The use of mean\ndiameter instead of the appropriate high moment led to a serious underestimate of\nthe contribution of scattering to attenuation. An improved calculation using recent\nmeasurements of ice grain size distributions at depths down to nearly 300 m in ice\nnear the South Pole suggests that scattering off the largest grains may account for\nthe 300 m attenuation length.\n2. Electrically charged linear dislocations in the ice crystals absorb energy from acoustic\nwaves at a rate proportional to the concentration of dislocations and to the square of\nwave frequency. They also slow the acoustic waves by an amount that, though small,\nmay be detectable by analyzing future pinger data at longer baselines with a larger\nsignal-to-noise ratio made possible by the larger repetition rate. Data on dislocation\nconcentrations in glacial ice, obtained since the evaluation in [8], suggest that their\ncontribution to absorption may account for the 300 m attenuation length.\n3. There may be layered density fluctuations in the ice, with the thickness of the layers\nin the 1-10 cm range and the magnitude of the density fluctuations at the \u223c0.1%\n\nlevel. Moreover, these layers undulate as a result of wind sculpting the snow surface1\n1\n\nThese undulations are called sastrugi.\n\n\f159\nat the time of deposition. The wavelength of these undulations is on the order of 1 m.\nTherefore sound rays crossing propagating horizontally could cross hundreds of layers\nin propagating hundreds of meters. Diagonal rays cross more layers than horizontal\nones, but even horizontal rays can cross many layers due to the undulations. Each\nlayer crossing causes some propagation loss due to acoustic impedance (Z = \u03c1v where\n\u03c1 is the density and v is the sound speed variation. Although the contribution of each\nlayer crossing may be small, the accumulation over hundreds of layer crossings could\nbe significant.\nThe three attenuation mechanisms depend differently on frequency and depth.\nFuture measurements could enable SPATS to determine their relative contributions by determining the frequency and depth dependence of the attenuation.\n\n9.3\n\nWhat's next for SPATS\nWhile the sound speed precision achieved is already good (better than 1%), it\n\ncould be improved perhaps by a factor of 2-3. The analysis used pinger data from the first\npinger season, over a distance of 125 m. The higher quality data from the second season\ncould be used, and larger baselines could be used. The inter-string data could also be used.\nThe limiting factors in the precision of this analysis are the precision with which we know\nthe distance between holes, and the precision with which we can resolve the rising edge of\neach signal pulse as recorded by a sensor. This resolution (on the rise time) is much smaller\nthan width of the pulse. So although the pulses can be seen clearly over large baselines,\nif the first oscillation of the signal cannot be clearly resolved above the noise then shorter\nbaselines must be used. This is why only the shortest baseline was used in the analysis of\nthe 2007-2008 data.\nIt is a high priority to distinguish both the depth and frequency dependence of\nattenuation. This is the primary goal of a new pinger data taking campaign planned for\nthe 2009-2010 season.\nNow that the transient detection and analysis chain has been verified with the\nIceCube holes and Rod wells, it is good that they are quieting down. So far we have only\ndetected emission from manmade sources. Detecting emission from inside the bulk of the\nglacier itself (away from manmade holes) could provide evidence for stick-slip processes\n\n\f160\nwithin the solid ice (in addition to the stick-slip motion thought to occur at the ice-bedrock\ninterface).\nWe plan to search for neutrino-induced signals in addition to glaciological signals.\nA null result could be used to set a limit on the neutrino flux. The main challenge to\nperforming a neutrino search is to understand the response of our sensors better, as they\nare known to be resonant sensors each with an unknown absolute response. It will likely be\nnecessary to incorporate the absolute calibration uncertainty as a systematic error band in\nthe neutrino flux limit.\n\n9.4\n\nOutlook for acoustic neutrino detection in ice\nWe have determined that below the firn, both the amount of refraction and the\n\nnoise level are low. Moreover, the noise level is very stable which allows very stable acquisition of transient events with a simple threshold trigger. All of these are beneficial for\ndetecting high-energy neutrinos acoustically. The amount of acoustic attenuation caused by\nthe ice, on the other hand, is significantly larger than previously theorized. It is important\nto understand why this is, and what it's mechanism is, in order to determine whether acoustic neutrino detection in ice is feasible. In particular, if the attenuation is due to scattering\nrather than absorption, it may still be possible to use the scattered energy.\nIn any case, the outlook for acoustic neutrino detection in South Pole ice is not as\ngood as that indicated by the simulations we performed several years ago. At that time we\nused the only knowledge of the acoustic ice properties we had, which were theoretical. Now\nthat we have solid measurements of the various properties, it will be interesting to update\nthe previous simulations. We can expect that the GZK rate achieved with the previous\narray geometry will be reduced, or alternatively that to achieve the same sensitivity, greater\ninstrumentation density is necessary.\nIt is now clear that the radio method can achieve superior sensitivity per cost\nthan both the acoustic and the optical methods, in the GZK energy range. While the\nprospects for multi-module, acoustic-only detection of GZK neutrinos by an autonomous\nacoustic array are reduced, individual hits from an acoustic array operated synchronously\nwith a radio array could still be valuable. This is true for both acoustic and optical hits.\nThe best configuration may be a large radio array that could trigger both an optical array\n(IceCube) and an acoustic array. If and when detection of the first GZK neutrinos is\n\n\f161\nclaimed (likely either by the Pierre Auger Observatory or by a radio experiment), the\nevents will likely be close to threshold and difficult to distinguish from both known and\nunknown backgrounds. Even a single hit on a single module of an alternative type (optical\nor acoustic) could provide much-needed confirmation of the discovery. Such information\ncould also significantly improve the direction and energy reconstruction of the events, which\nwill be the first quantities to determine once discovery is confirmed.\n\n\f162\n\nAppendix A\n\nSimulation of a hybrid\noptical/radio/acoustic extension to\nIceCube for EeV neutrino\ndetection\nThe results of this simulation encouraged us to pursue the idea of hybrid neutrino detection of\nthe South Pole and motivated the development of SPATS. It appeared as [5] and I reproduce\nit here for reference.\nAbstract\n\nAstrophysical neutrinos at \u223cEeV energies promise to be an interesting source\n\nfor astrophysics and particle physics. Detecting the predicted cosmogenic (\"GZK\") neu-\n\ntrinos at 1016 - 1020 eV would test models of cosmic ray production at these energies and\nprobe particle physics at \u223c100 TeV center-of-mass energy. While IceCube could detect \u223c1\n\nGZK event per year, it is necessary to detect 10 or more events per year in order to study\ntemporal, angular, and spectral distributions. The IceCube observatory may be able to\nachieve such event rates with an extension including optical, radio, and acoustic receivers.\nWe present results from simulating such a hybrid detector.\n\n\f163\n\nA.1\n\nIntroduction\nDetecting and characterizing astrophysical neutrinos in the 1016 eV to 1020 eV\n\nrange is a central goal of astro-particle physics. The more optimistic flux models in this range\ninvolve discovery physics including topological defects and relic neutrinos. Detecting the\nsmaller flux of cosmogenic (or Greisen, Zatsepin, and Kuzmin, \"GZK\") neutrinos produced\nvia ultra-high energy cosmic ray interaction with the cosmic microwave background would\ntest models of cosmic ray production and propagation and of particle physics at extreme\nenergies. With \u223c100 detected events, their angular distribution would give a measurement\nof the total neutrino-nucleon cross section at \u223c100 TeV center of mass, probing an energy\n\nscale well beyond the reach of the LHC. Hence, as a baseline, a detector capable of detecting\n\u223c10 GZK events per year has promising basic physics potential. If any of the more exotic\n\ntheories predicting greater EeV neutrino fluxes is correct, the argument in favor of such a\ndetector is even stronger.\nTo detect \u223c10 GZK events per year, a detector with an effective volume of\n\n\u223c100 km3 at EeV energies is necessary. In addition to the possibility of identifying neutrino-\n\ninduced air showers, there are three methods of ultra-high energy neutrino detection in solid\nmedia: optical, radio, and acoustic. Optical Cherenkov detection is a well-established technique that has detected atmospheric neutrinos up to 1014 eV and set limits up to 1018 eV\n\n[73]. Radio efforts have produced steadily improving upper limits on neutrino fluxes from\n1016 to 1025 eV [74, 75, 76]. Acoustic detection efforts are at an earlier stage, with one limit\npublished thus far from 1022 to 1025 eV [1].\nThe currently planned 1 km3 optical neutrino telescopes expect a GZK event\nrate of \u223c1 per year. It is possible to extend this by adding more optical strings for a\n\nmodest additional cost [77], but it's difficult to imagine achieving 10 or more events per year\nwith optical strings alone. The radio and acoustic methods have potentially large effective\n\nvolumes with relatively few receivers, but the methods are unproven in that they have\nnever detected a neutrino. Indeed, if radio experiments claim detection of a GZK signal, it\nmay be difficult to confirm that it is really a neutrino signal. However, it may be possible\nto bootstrap the large effective volumes of radio and acoustic detection with the optical\nmethod, by building a hybrid detector that can detect a large rate of radio or acoustic events,\na fraction of which are also detected by an optical detector. A signal seen in coincidence\nbetween any two of the three methods would be convincing. The information from multiple\n\n\f164\nmethods can be combined for hybrid reconstruction, yielding improved angular and energy\nresolution.\nWe simulated the sensitivity of a detector that could be constructed by expanding\nthe IceCube observatory currently under construction at the South Pole. The ice at the\nSouth Pole is likely well-suited for all three methods: Its optical clarity has been established\nby the AMANDA experiment [73], and its radio clarity and suitability for radio detection\nin the GZK energy range has been established by the RICE experiment [74]. Acoustically,\nthe signal in ice is ten times greater than that in water. Theoretical estimates indicate\nlow attenuation and noise [8], and efforts are planned to measure both [78] with sensitive\ntransducers developed for glacial ice [79]. Here we estimate the sensitivity of such a detector\nby exposing all three components to a common Monte Carlo event set and counting events\ndetected by each method alone and by each combination of multiple methods.\n\nA.2\n\nSimulation\nIceCube will have 80 strings arrayed hexagonally with a horizontal spacing of\n\n125 m. In [77], the GZK sensitivity achieved by adding more optical strings at larger\ndistances (\"IceCube-Plus\") was estimated, and the possibility of also adding radio and\nacoustic modules was mentioned. Here we consider an IceCube-Plus configuration consisting\nof a \"small\" optical array overlapped by a \"large\" acoustic/radio array with a similar number\nof strings but larger horizontal spacing. The optimal string spacing for GZK detection was\nfound to be \u223c1 km for both radio and acoustic strings. This coincidence allows the two\n\nmethods to share hole drilling and cable costs, both of which are dominant costs of such\narrays.\nThe geometry of the simulated array is shown in Fig. A.1. We take the optical\n\narray to be IceCube as well as a ring of 13 optical strings with a 1 km radius, surrounding\nIceCube. All optical strings have standard IceCube geometry: 60 modules per string,\nspaced every 17 m, from 1.4 to 2.4 km depth. Encompassing this is a hexagonal array of 91\nradio/acoustic strings with 1 km spacing. Each radio/acoustic hole has 5 radio receivers,\nspaced every 100 m from 200 m to 600 m depth, and 300 acoustic receivers, spaced every 5 m\nfrom 5 m to 1500 m depth. At greater depths both methods suffer increased absorption due\nto the warmer ice. The large acoustic density per string is necessary because the acoustic\nradiation pattern is thin (only \u223c10 m thick) in the direction along the shower.

Between 1016 and 1020 eV, the neutrino interaction length ranges between 6000\nand 200 km [80], so up-going neutrinos are efficiently absorbed by the Earth and only downgoing events are detectable. A full simulation would include the energy-dependent slow rolloff at the horizon. Here we assume all up-going neutrinos are absorbed before reaching the\nfiducial volume, and no down-going neutrinos are; we generate incident neutrino directions\nisotropically in 2\u03c0 sr. Vertices are also generated uniformly in a fiducial cylinder of radius\n10 km, extending from the surface to 3 km depth.\nThe Bjorken parameter y = Ehad /E\u03bd varies somewhat with energy and from event\nto event, but we choose the mean value, y = 0.2, for simplicity.

Note\nthat different channels were used for different combinations (see text).\n\n\f167\ntect both muons and showers, but here we only consider the muon channel; simulation of the\nshower channel is in progress. The radio and acoustic methods cannot detect muon tracks\nbut can detect electromagnetic and hadronic showers. Under our assumptions of constant\ny and no event-to-event fluctuations, all flavors interacting via both CC and NC produce\nthe same hadronic shower. Electron neutrinos interacting via the charged current also produce an electromagnetic cascade which produces radio and acoustic signals superposed on\nthe hadronic signals. However, at the energies of interest here, electromagnetic showers are\nlengthened to hundreds of meters by the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. This weakens\ntheir radio and acoustic signals significantly, and we assume they are negligible.\nFor simulation of the optical response, the standard Monte Carlo chain used in\ncurrent AMANDA-IceCube analyses [73] was performed. After the primary trigger requiring\nany 5 hits in a 2.5 \u03bcs window, a local coincidence trigger was applied: Ten local coincidences\nwere required, where a local coincidence is at least two hits on neighboring or next-toneighboring modules within 1 \u03bcs. Compared with [77], we used an updated ice model with\nincreased absorption, which may account for our factor of \u223c2 lower effective volume.\n\nEach simulated radio \"receiver\" consists of two vertical half-wave dipole antennas\n\nseparated vertically by 5 m to allow local rejection of down-going anthropogenic noise. We\nassume an effective height at the peak frequency (280 MHz in ice) equal to 10 cm, with\n\u00b120% bandwidth to the \u20133 dB points. As currently under development for RICE-II, we\n\nassume optical fiber transport of the signal to the DAQ, with losses of 1 dB/km (measured)\nthrough the fiber. The electric field strength E(\u03c9) is calculated from the shower according to\nthe ZHS prescription [81, 40]. Frequency-dependent ice attenuation effects are incorporated\nusing measurements at South Pole Station [56]. The signal at the surface electronics is then\ntransformed into the time domain, resulting in a waveform 10 ns long, sampled at 0.5 ns\nintervals, at each antenna. Two receivers with signals exceeding 3.5 times the estimated\nroot-mean-square noise temperature \u03c3kT (thermal plus a system temperature of 100 K)\nwithin a time window of 30 \u03bcs are required to trigger.\nThe unattenuated acoustic pulse P (t) produced at arbitrary position with respect\nto a hadronic cascade is calculated by integrating over the cascade energy distribution.\nThe cascade is parametrized with the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen parametrization, with \u03bb\n(longitudinal tail length) parametrized from [40]. The dominant mechanism of acoustic wave\nabsorption in South Pole ice is theorized [8] to be molecular reorientation, which increases\nwith ice temperature. Using a temperature profile measured at the South Pole along with\n\n\f168\nlaboratory absorption measurements, an absorption vs. depth profile was estimated. The\npredicted absorption length ranges from 8.6 km at the surface to 4.8 km at 1 km depth to\n0.7 km at 2 km depth. The frequency-independent absorption is integrated from source to\nreceiver and applied in the time domain.\nSouth Pole ice is predicted to be much quieter than ocean water at the relevant\nfrequencies (\u223c10-60 kHz), because there are no waves, currents, or animals. Anthropogenic\nsurface noise will largely be refracted back up to the surface due to the sound speed gradient\nin the upper 200 m of snow that is not fully dense (\"firn\"). For the current simulation we\nassume ambient noise is negligible compared to transducer self-noise. Work is underway\nto produce transducers with self-noise at the 2-5 mPa level [79]. For comparison, ambient\nnoise in the ocean is \u223c100 mPa [1]. The acoustic trigger used in this simulation required\nthat 3 receivers detect pressure pulses above a threshold of 9 mPa.\n\nA.3\n\nResults and conclusion\nTen-thousand events were generated at each half-decade in neutrino energy in a\n\ncylinder of volume 942 km3 . For each method and combination of methods, the number\nof detected events was used to calculate effective volume as a function of neutrino energy\n(Fig. A.2). This was folded with the GZK flux model of [14, 82] and the cross-section\nparametrizations of [80] to estimate detectable event rates (Fig. A.2). We use a flux model\nwhich assumes source evolution according to \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. This model is a factor of \u223c2 greater\n\nthan that for \u03a9\u039b = 0 evolution; it is unclear which model is correct [82]. For radio and\n\nacoustic, and their combination, all flavors and both interactions were included. For those\ncombinations including the optical method, only the muon channel has been simulated thus\nfar; including showers will increase event rates for these combinations.\nIt may be possible to build an extension like that considered here for a relatively\nsmall cost. Holes for radio antennas and acoustic transducers can be narrow and shallow,\nand both devices are simpler than photo-multiplier tubes. The necessarily large acoustic\nchannel multiplicity is partially offset by the fact that the acoustic signals are slower by five\norders of magnitude, making data acquisition and processing easier.\nThe IceCube observatory will observe the neutrino universe from 10's of GeV to\n100's of PeV. Our simulations indicate that extending it with radio and acoustic strings could\nproduce a neutrino detector competitive with other projects optimized for high-statistics\n\n\f169\nmeasurements of GZK neutrinos but with the unique advantage of cross-calibration via\ncoincident optical-radio, optical-acoustic, and radio-acoustic events.\n\n\f170\n\nBibliography\n[1] J.
