Evidence supporting this comes from: 1) the location of GRBs in regions of active star formation [2]; 2) the clear presence of supernovae\nof Type Ic-BL (\"broad-lined Ic\") in conjunction with three GRBs: 980425, 030329, and\n031203; 3) the presence of supernova-like bumps in most other GRBs where they might\nbe observed [3]; and 4) the similarity in energy between the beaming-corrected GRB\nenergy and that of a supernova.\nAccepting this as a starting point, an important question must be why some massive\nstars die as supernovae of the ordinary variety, while others die as GRBs. The fraction\nthat do die as GRBs is apparently very small. Taking an event rate of core-collapse\nsupernovae visible from the earth today as \u223c20 per 16 arc min squared per year [4], the\nintegrated rate of supernovae on the sky is about 6 per second. BATSE saw about a burst\na day. Correcting by a factor of 300 for beaming and another factor of three for Earth\noccultation and bursts that were missed for reasons other than beaming, the GRB sky\nrate is about 0.02 per second. That is, GRBs are a fraction of order 0.3% of all massive\nstar deaths. This fraction could be larger if there are numerous sub-luminous events like\n\n\fGRB 980425 or cosmic X-ray flashes (XRFs), and it might increase with redshift, but\napparently GRBs are a rare channel of massive star death.\nAnother interesting question is whether GRBs and ordinary supernovae are the extrema of a continuum of events or separate classes of explosions. The existence of such\ndiverse phenomena as XRFs, 980425, and GRBs with varying energy and supernova\nproperties suggests a continuum. So, too, does the growing class of \"hyper-energetic\" or\ngrossly asymmetric supernovae like SN 2005bf [5, 6, 7]. Add to this the fact that most\nbroad-lined Type Ic supernovae do not harbor GRBs [8], and a compelling case might\nbe made for some continuously variable parameter that dials between ordinary supernovae and energetic GRBs like 990123. Clearly, the difference is that GRBs concentrate\na significant fraction of their 1051 - 1052 ergs into highly relativistic (\u0393 > 200) beamed\nejecta while ordinary supernovae do not, but searches beyond that for a deeper physical\ncause take us into what is suspected, and away from what is certain.\n\nGRB PROGENITORS\nThe two key quantities that determine how a massive star dies are its mass and the\nrotation rate of its inner few solar masses. Stars that are more massive when they die\nare more likely to make black holes. More massive stars also evolve more quickly\nand may more effectively preserve the large angular momentum they have at birth\nin their core [9]. Rotation is a key ingredient in any successful GRB model. If the\nrotational energy of a neutron star is to provide the \u223c1052 erg inferred for some of the\nsupernovae accompanying GRBs, it must have a rotational period \u223c1 ms. This implies\na specific equatorial angular momentum, j \u2248 7 \u00d7 1015 cm2 s\u22121 (P/1 ms)(R/10 km)2 ,\nabout 20 or more times that of a typical pulsar. If a disk is to form around a black hole\none needs\nspecific angular momentum of the last stable orbit is\n\u221a more. At 3 M\u2299 , the\n16 cm2 s\u22121 (M /3M ) for a Schwarzschild black hole,\n=\n4.6\n\u00d7\n10\njlso = 2 3GM/c\nBH\n\u2299\n\u221a\nand jlso = 2/ 3GM/c = 1.5 \u00d7 1016 cm2 s\u22121 (MBH /3M\u2299 ) for an extreme Kerr hole.\nGiven that angular momentum increases monotonically with interior mass from 1.5 to 3\nM\u2299, the necessary values for neutron star models and black hole models are qualitatively\nsimilar.\nStudies of massive star evolution that include estimated magnetic torques [9] have\nshown that such large values of angular momentum are not easily achieved if the star\nspends much time as a red giant, or even if it loses its envelope early on, but has a\nhigh mass loss rate afterwords as a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star [10]. A frequently discussed\nscenario is a stellar merger, but the central region of a differentially rotating star that has\nlost its angular momentum is virtually impossible to spin up again. This limits viable\nmodels to those where the merger removes the envelope (with enough time still left for\nfor its dispersal), produces a compact helium star that never becomes a blue or red giant\nitself, and still does not slow down the denser, inner regions of the star.\nSeveral possibilities remain, however. One is that the magnetic torques used in the\nabove study were simply too large, but then one must take care both to produce the large\nnumber of slowly rotating neutron stars that are seen, and not overproduce GRBs. Another possibility is a binary merger between two massive stars, both of which are burning\nhelium in their centers [11]. The merger ejects both envelopes and the (now rapidly ro-\n\n\ftating) residual helium star evolves to produce the burst a few hundred thousand years\nlater, after the envelope has left the vicinity. Even then, though, the new helium star must\nlose a very limited amount of mass before dying, so it helps if the merger occurs late\nduring helium burning for one or both stars.\nA third possibility is that GRBs come from the merger of a black hole or neutron\nstar with either the helium core of a massive star [12, 13] or a white dwarf [14]. In\nthe former case, the giant star's envelope must be completely dispersed before the final\nmerger occurs. In the white dwarf case, one would not expect such a tight correlation\nwith star forming regions, but a fraction of GRBs could still be made this way. In both\nof these compact merger models, however, there is so much angular momentum that\nthe total duration of the event is quite long, longer than typical GRBs. It could be that\nthe observed burst only reflects the epoch of maximum accretion in which case both\nenduring activity and long precursors might be present. Or perhaps this model only\nmakes very long GRBs.\nA final possibility, and one that has received a lot of attention lately, is that GRBs\nresult from a rare channel of single star evolution in which red giant formation is avoided\naltogether. The possibilities here are exciting and warrant a more lengthy discussion.\n\nA Single Star Model\nIt has been recently realized [15, 16] that stars which rotate very rapidly on the main\nsequence, with equatorial speeds near 400 km s\u22121 instead of 200 - 300 km s\u22121 , may\nexperience nearly complete mixing on the main sequence [17, 18]. In fact, rotationallyinduced mixing in such stars, chiefly by Eddington-Sweet circulation, keeps the star's\ncomposition nearly homogeneous until the end of helium burning. A red giant is never\nformed and the star goes straight from the main sequence to being a Wolf-Rayet star.\nSuch stars will have more rapidly rotating iron cores when they die, though still not fast\nenough to be GRBs if the helium star loses a lot of mass. Because the progenitors are on\nthe very high end of the observed distribution function for O- and B-star rotation [19],\nGRBs will be a rare channel of star death.\nThis model has several beneficial features for GRBs. First, the progenitor star is\na compact WR star, mostly composed of oxygen with little helium at its surface - a\nWO star. This agrees well with the properties of those few GRB-supernovae that have\nbeen well studied spectroscopically. Second, it is possible to produce a wider range of\nGRB progenitor masses. Main sequence stars as light as 10 M\u2299 produce helium and\nheavy element cores that - modulo the mass loss - are about as large as that of a 25\nM\u2299 star with slow rotation (both about 9 M\u2299 ). Such big cores evolve rapidly, retain\ntheir angular momentum, and develop big iron cores when they die. They are more\nlikely to make black holes. Below about 10 M\u2299 , larger, possibly unphysical rotation\nspeeds are necessary on the main sequence to cause Eddington-Sweet circulation to mix\nthe star efficiently. On the upper end, very massive GRB progenitors can be produced\nfrom main sequence stars of more moderate mass than previously thought. For slowly\nrotating, solar-metallicity stars, the largest helium core that can exist when the star dies\nis around 15 M\u2299 , corresponding to a main sequence star of 35 M\u2299 . Heavier stars lose\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Convective history of a rapidly rotating 16 M\u2299 star that experiences nearly complete mixing\non the main sequence and avoids red giant formation. The left axis is the interior mass, cross hatching\nshows regions that are convective, and gray shading indicates specific nuclear energy generation on a\nlogarithmic scale (right gray-scale bar, in log ergs/g/s). The bottom axis is the time until death (on a\nlogarithmic scale). This model had an initial composition of one per cent solar and an equatorial velocity\nhalf way through hydrogen burning of 380 km s\u22121 . The final mass was 14.0 M\u2299 and the iron core mass\nwas 1.60 M\u2299 . The abundances in the surface convection zone of the presupernova star were 9.5% He, 30%\nC, 57% O, and 2.7% Ne. The radius was 4.1 \u00d7 1010 cm.\n\ntheir envelopes to winds and the resulting helium core shrinks by mass loss. But for these\nrapidly rotating, well-mixed stars, the upper bound on the helium core is, in principle,\nequal to the main sequence mass. Of course, mass loss, both on the main sequence and\nespecially as a WR star, will still shrink the mass. As we shall see shortly however,\nturning the metallicity down can alleviate the mass loss of a WR star, so that GRB\nprogenitors in low metallicity regions could have very big mass.\nAn upper limit to the helium core mass that comes from these rapidly rotating models\nis the first mass to encounter the pulsational pair instability [20], about 40 M\u2299 of helium\nand heavy elements. The evolved star experiences violent, repeated, nuclear-powered\nexplosions when the star ignites oxygen burning. Each outburst ejects solar masses of\nsurface material. This material surrounds the star when it finally dies (typically death\nhappens months to years later) and prevents a GRB from getting out (though such\nexplosions are interesting in their own right). For helium cores above about 65 M\u2299 ,\nthe pair-instability becomes so violent that it leads to the complete disruption of the star\nand no GRB will be made, but above 140 M\u2299 a new regime is encountered where black\nholes are formed and GRBs of a more energetic, longer-lasting variety become possible\n[21]. In slowly rotating stars, without mass loss, the pulsational pair instability is first\nencountered for main sequence stars of \u223c100 M\u2299 and black holes are made starting\n\n\fFIGURE 2. Specific angular momentum as a function of mass in two stars with initial mass 16 M\u2299\n[15]. Both models included angular momentum transport due to rotationally induced mixing processes\nand magnetic torques. The angular momentum is evaluated at the zero age main sequence (top line, solid),\ncentral helium depletion (dotted line, next down), carbon depletion (dashed line), and presupernova (dark\nsolid line). The top star had an equatorial rotation rate on the main sequence of 380 km s\u22121 , experienced\ncomplete mixing, and avoided ever making a red giant. The top star also had a Wolf-Rayet stellar mass\nloss rate corresponding to 1% solar metallicity. The bottom star had solar metallicity and a slower rotation\nrate on the main sequence, 215 km s\u22121 . The bottom star became a red supergiant, lost more mass, and\nproduced a slowly rotating iron core that would give a 8 ms pulsar period after collapse and neutrino loss.\nThe top star ended up with a higher mass and much greater rotation rate. This star would form a black\nhole accretion disk starting at 3.5 M\u2299 . Avoiding red giant formation and reducing the mass loss greatly\nincreases the probability of making a GRB.\n\nat about 260 M\u2299 , so these lower values for rapidly rotating stars are very significant\nchanges. The numbers are currently uncertain, however, because few rapidly rotating\nmodels have been calculated and the effect of the rotation on the pair instability has not\nbeen included in a self-consistent way.\nA final interesting consequence of rapid rotation and nearly homogeneous mixing, is\nthat single stars, even at low metallicity, can end their lives as compact WR stars without\nthe need of a binary companion to absorb the envelope. This has interesting implications\nfor making GRBs at high redshift.\n\n\fThe Metallicity Dependence of GRBs\nWhether the WR-star that serves as the progenitor of a GRB is made by merger or\nrotationally-induced mixing, it is essential that its mass loss, or more specifically, its\nangular momentum loss, be low. A massive WR star typically spends 0.5 to 1 million\nyears burning helium. If, during that time, its mass loss rate is over 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , it will\nlose a significant fraction of its mass. Magnetic torques maintain nearly rigid rotation\nduring helium burning, so the continued expansion of layers deep in the star to larger\nradius brakes the rotation of the inner core beyond what is needed later to make a GRB.\nMass loss is the enemy of GRBs.\nFortunately, it has been recently determined [22] that reducing the metal content of a\nWR star even by a factor of a few lowers its mass loss very appreciably, approximately\nas Z0.86 . Once the metallicity has been reduced by a factor of 10, typical mass loss rates\nfor 10 - 20 M\u2299 WR stars are \u223c10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and less. Losing less than a solar mass\nwould not greatly alter the final angular momentum distribution of a massive WR star,\nso at metallicities \u223c10% solar and less, GRBs should be plentiful. It is important to note\nthat the metallicity employed in the scaling here is the initial concentration of iron in the\nstar. It does not include the carbon and oxygen at the surface of a WC or WO star that\nwas made in the star itself during helium burning, at least not until the iron abundance\nbecomes so low that the mass loss is negligible anyway, roughly 0.01 solar.\nThis does not mean that GRBs cannot happen in regions with solar metallicity, only\nthat it is harder. Measured WR mass loss rates show a considerable spread and some\nmerger models might also still work. The magnetic torques estimated in the models are\nuncertain and, for stars that are highly deformed the angular dependence of the mass\nloss rate is an issue. Mass loss preferentially from the poles would reduce the amount of\nangular momentum carried away by each gram [23].\nHowever, the key role of mass loss and its strong metallicity dependence does suggest\nthat the fraction of massive stars dying while making GRBs may be larger in regions\nwhere less nucleosynthesis has occurred. As the metallicity declines it may also be possible to make more energetic, longer lasting bursts. Higher mass and angular momentum\nat death increase the reservoir of material that can accrete into a black hole. It may also\nlead to more rapidly rotating neutron stars in the millisecond magnetar model.\nThe low mass loss rate also has implications for the afterglow analysis, and a lower\ndensity may be more consistent with observations [24]. One must take care, however,\nsince the wind that is sampled in the afterglows was ejected during the post-helium\nburning evolution of the star, during which the mass loss rate may have varied from\nwhat is observed on the helium-burning main sequence.\n\nTHE THREE COMPONENTS OF A GRB\nA GRB with an energetic supernova accompanying it will have three components: 1)\na highly relativistic, \u0393 \u223c>200, central jet with an opening angle \u223c0.1 radian measured\nfrom the rotational axis; 2) a broader region of very energetic, but subrelativistic ejecta\nextending out to angles \u223c1 radian; and 3) slower moving ejecta in the equator. In general,\nregion 1 is responsible for the GRB, region 2 is necessary for the supernova and the\n\n\f( _ 200\n\nv ~ 0.1 c\n56Ni\n\n56Ni\n\n56Ni\n\n56Ni\n\nFIGURE 3. Schematic illustrating the three components of a typical GRB and its accompanying\nsupernova. A core relativistic jet (\u223c0.1 radian, \u0393 \u223c 200, KE \u223c 1051 erg) is responsible for the GRB\nand its afterglows. A broader angle, energetic outflow (\u223c 1 radian, v/c \u223c0.1, KE \u223c1052 erg) is responsible\nfor exploding the star and making the 56 Ni to power the light curve. A third component of low velocity\nmaterial exists in the equatorial plane of those models in which central mass ejection is blocked by an\naccretion disk (e.g., collapsars). This component typically fails to achieve ejection on the first try and falls\nback to power a continuing explosion.\n\n56 Ni\n\nto make it bright, and region 3 is naturally present in any model where outflow\nin the equator is blocked, e.g., by an accretion disk in the collapsar model. Region 2\nprobably contains most of the energy and is necessary because a narrow jet, by itself, is\nan ineffective way of blowing up a star or producing explosive nucleosynthesis. Region\n3 may move out initially, but is largely responsible for the \"fall-back\" that may keep\nan accretion-powered source active long after the initial burst is over. One might also\nproperly discuss a fourth region, the jet cocoon lying between regions 1 and 2, but here\nwe count that as part of the jet.\nIn the collapsar model [25], the jet is produced in the near vicinity of the black hole by\n\n\fneutrinos or MHD processes, while the large angle ejecta come from the disk wind. In\nthe millisecond magnetar model, theorists have yet to talk about the two components\nin any detail, but one might imagine a large angle component from filling a cavity\nwith nearly isotropic (thermal?) radiation, while simultaneously producing a narrower,\nelectromagnetically focused outflow. Without better knowledge of the physics of how\nthe relativistic jet is launched and the efficiency of the disk-wind, it is not possible to say\nwhat fraction of the energy goes into each of these components, but in all likelihood that\nfraction varies with the mass and angular momentum distribution of the presupernova\nstar. It is also worth keeping in mind that the central engine must not only maintain a\npowerful jet for at least the \u223c10 seconds it takes the jet to reach the surface of the star,\nbut must hold the direction of that jet steady to better than 3 degrees [26]. If the jet\nwavers by more than that, it becomes contaminated with too many baryons on the way\nout to make a GRB.\nIf the three components can vary independently, and it is hard to see why they\nwouldn't, one expects a wide variety of phenomena resulting from essentially the same\ncentral engine. These could include a) ordinary GRBs [Regions 1 and 2 strongly active];\nb) anisotropic broad-lined supernova without any GRB or bright afterglow [Region 1\ntrapped in the star, Region 2 dominant; e.g., ref. 8] c) GRBs with continuing activity\nafter the burst [Regions 1 and 3 active]; d) XRFs and SN 1998bw [either the cocoon\nof an ordinary GRB seen somewhat off axis or an ordinary GRB with higher baryon\nloading in the jet]; and others. In this context, SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh need not be\ntypical of all supernovae associated with GRBs or XRFs. There would be a continuum\nof events with the fainter GRBs and supernovae quite possibly the dominant case in a\nvolume-limited sample.\nIt must be one of the observational goals of the future to gather a sufficient sample\nto determine if this is true. Are GRBs and core-collapse supernovae a continuum of\nevents with a common central engine and a smoothly varying parameter - e.g., rotation underlying them all. Or are GRBs and supernovae two discrete, different classes of high\nenergy explosions. Personally, our underlying bias [27] is that rotation plays little role\nin most supernovae. These are the result of (slowly rotating) neutron star formation and\nneutrino transport. But \"GRBs\" are a diverse class of phenomena, overlapping common\nsupernovae in observable properties. Perhaps rotation powers them all? This is a very\nold question, but still a critical one. Just how do massive stars die (and explode)?\n\nGRBS AT HIGH REDSHIFT\nIf the properties of GRBs are sensitive to the metallicity as we have described, then\none expects systematic differences in the appearance of GRBs \"locally\" and at high\nredshift (where the metallicity is presumably low). On the average, though perhaps not\nindividually, GRBs in more metal-deficient regions will come from stars that are more\nmassive and that have lost less angular momentum. Their disks will draw from a larger\nreservoir of matter and, if, as seems reasonable, the total burst of energy correlates with\nthe total mass accreted, the GRB will last longer and have more energy. The supernova\ncomponent may also be brighter if the disk wind lasts longer and carries more mass.\nBigger helium stars are more tightly bound, however, and harder to explode [28], so the\n\n\fsupernova could experience significantly more fall-back. Continuing accretion activity\nwould be the norm.\nIt is also possible, in the collapsar model, to have too much angular momentum\n[25, 29, 30]. Angular momentum much in excess of 1017 cm2 s\u22121 will lead to a pile\nup in the disk at such large radii that neutrino dissipation is negligible. Unable to\ndissipate its binding energy, the disk becomes unstable and perhaps dominated by an\noutflow, accompanied by very little accretion. Such behavior has been seen recently in\nunpublished calculations by Weiqun Zhang and Andrew MacFadyen. Since the outflow\nhas too little energy to explode the whole star in one try, a limit cycle may operate\n(though this has yet to be followed on the computer). Since angular momentum increases\nmonotonically outwards in the equator of a GRB progenitor, material accretes efficiently\nuntil a limiting angular momentum is reached. During that time it maintains a strong jet\nwhich can escape the star and make a GRB. Eventually though, the angular momentum\nbecomes so large that the disk ceases to be an NDAF (neutrino-dominated accretion\nflow) and stagnates. Matter is still falling in, however, especially from high latitudes.\nMixing and shear will eventually reduce the angular momentum to the point where\naccretion can begin again, launch a new jet, and repeat the cycle. The characteristic\ntime scale would be given by mixing and fall back. A few hours is reasonable [31].\nThis physics is possibly reflected in the observed features of GRB 050904, the most\ndistant GRB discovered [32] and localized [33] so far (z = 6.29). This was a long,\nmulti-peaked, bright burst that lasted well over 205 seconds [34] and had an equivalent\nisotropic energy of 0.66 to 3.2 \u00d7 1054 erg [35, 36] and a beaming corrected energy of\n4 to 12 \u00d71051 erg. Repeated flaring activity was seen from the burst for 1.5 hours in\nthe rest frame [36]. While the properties of this burst are not dramatically different from\nsome others seen closer by, it does lie at an extreme of energy, duration and variability.\nIt will be very interesting to see if future bursts at this redshift and higher show these\nsame characteristics.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors appreciate helpful discussions with and access to the unpublished calculations of Andrew MacFadyen and Weiqun Zhang.
