The precise spatial\narrangement of such structures can result in\nsurprising optical properties that are not found in any\nnaturally occurring material3,4. Here, the designed\nactivity emerges from collective effects of singular\ncomponents equipped with limited individual\nfunctionality. Top-down fabrication of plasmonic\nmaterials with a pre-designed optical response in the\nvisible range by conventional lithographic methods\nhas remained challenging due to their limited\nresolution, the complexity of scaling, and the\ndifficulty to extend these techniques to three-\ndimensional architectures. Bottom-up molecular self-\nassembly provides an alternative route to create such\nmaterials which is not bound by the above\nlimitations5,6. We demonstrate here how the DNA\norigami method7 can be used to produce plasmonic\nmaterials with a tailored optical response at visible\nwavelengths. Harnessing the assembly power of 3D\nDNA origami8, we arranged metal nanoparticles (NPs)\nwith a spatial accuracy of 2 nm into nanoscale helices.\nThe helical structures assemble in solution in a\nmassively parallel fashion and with near quantitative\nyields. As a designed optical response, we generated\ngiant circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotary\ndispersion (ORD) in the visible range that originates\nfrom the collective plasmon-plasmon interactions\nwithin the nanohelices. We also show that the optical\nresponse can be tuned through the visible spectrum\nby changing the composition of the metal\nnanoparticles. The observed effects are independent\nof the propagation direction of the incident light and\ncan be switched by design between left- and right-\nhanded orientation. Our work demonstrates the\nproduction of complex bulk materials from precisely\ndesigned nanoscopic assemblies and highlights the\n\nenormous potential of DNA self-assembly for the\nfabrication of plasmonic nanostructures. Using the\npresented method, strategies can be conceived to\ncreate materials of negative refractive index9, which\nin turn would allow for applications such as\ncloaking10 or the construction of perfect lenses11.\nMetamaterials obtain their unique optical\nproperties from the precise arrangement of light\u2010\nsculpting elements in space. Owing to their surface\nplasmon resonances, metal nanostructures are\nparticularly promising components for such applications.\nTo obtain a metamaterial, the underlying (metal or\ndielectric) substrate must be structured on a length\u2010scale\nsmaller than the wavelength of the external\nelectromagnetic stimulus. For the visible range this\nimplies a characteristic scale of tens of nanometers, while\nfor infrared (IR) wavelengths this requirement is relaxed\nto hundreds of nanometers. Top\u2010down fabrication\nmethods are readily available for the latter length scale,\nand therefore remarkable progress has been already\nachieved in the IR in the past12\u201015. Realization of materials\nwith tailored optical response in the visible range,\nhowever, remains challenging due to the limited spatial\nresolution of standard lithographic techniques.\nWe here show that the extraordinary precision of\nDNA\u2010directed molecular self\u2010assembly makes it perfectly\nsuited for the creation of such materials. DNA self\u2010\nassembly allows for the sequence\u2010programmable spatial\narrangement of nanoscale objects, and this capability has\nalready provided the basis for a variety of applications in\nstructural\nbiology,\nnanoelectronics,\nand\nnanophotonics6,16\u201018. An important recent development\nhas been the introduction of the DNA origami technique,\nthrough which the assembly of nanoscale objects of\nunprecedented complexity has become feasible7,8. For\nDNA origami, hundreds of rationally designed \"staple\"\noligonucleotides are hybridized to a long single\u2010stranded\nDNA \"scaffold\" strand, which forces it to assume a specific\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. Assembly of DNA origami gold particle helices and principle of CD measurements. a, In our design, each DNA\u2010\nNP assembly is composed of nine 10 nm gold particles attached in a helical arrangement to the surface of a DNA origami 24\u2010\nhelix bundle. Each NP attachment site consists of three 15 nt long single\u2010stranded extensions of staple oligonucleotides. The\ngold nanoparticles carrying multiple thiol\u2010modified DNA strands, which are complementary to the staple extensions, were\nmixed with the assembled 24\u2010helix bundles and gel\u2010purified. b, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of assembled\nleft\u2010handed gold nanohelices (Scale bar: 100 nm). 97% of the NPs are assembled correctly. c, For CD measurements, the\ndifference in absorbance (\u2206A) between left\u2010handed circularly polarized light (LCP) and right\u2010handed circularly polarized light\n(RCP) of varying wavelengths through a cuvette containing a solution of gold nanohelices of a given handedness (here: left\u2010\nhanded) is recorded. \u2206A is represented as CD signal in dependence of the wavelength (cf. Fig. 2).\n\ntwo\u2010 or even three\u2010dimensional shape. The resulting\nobjects are fully addressable by their DNA sequence, and\nthis property can be utilized to decorate origami objects\nwith nanocomponents in a unique, sequence\u2010specific\nmanner.\nTo highlight the full power of this approach, we\naimed for the creation of plasmonic structures with an\noptical response that (i) originates from collective effects\nemerging from the precise spatial arrangement of\nproximal nanoparticles, and that (ii) requires genuinely\nthree\u2010dimensional structures. Helical arrangements of\nmetallic nanoparticles comply with these criteria. The\nresponse of helical structures to an electromagnetic field\nis associated with the effect of circular dichroism (CD),\nwhich denotes the differential absorption of left and right\ncircularly polarized light. This effect is well known from\n\"optically active\" chiral molecules, and in particular from\nbiomolecules such as DNA and proteins, which exhibit CD\nin the ultraviolet and IR range owing to electronic and\nvibronic excitations of their chiral secondary structure19.\nIt has been proposed theoretically that CD can be\nalso achieved in the visible through collective plasmon\nexcitations in chiral assemblies of metal nanoparticles20\nand it has been shown in several experiments that the CD\neffect can be transferred into the visible region by\ncombining the chiral morphology of organic molecules\nwith the plasmonic nature of metal particles21. There also\nhave been reports on DNA\u2010directed preparation of chiral\nmetal NP assemblies before22\u201024, however, the designs\nused in these studies were not suited to produce\ncontrolled and appreciable optical responses.\n\nThe design of our structures is presented in Figure\n1. They are based on DNA origami 24\u2010helix bundles that\noffer nine helically arranged attachment sites for ssDNA\u2010\ncovered plasmonic particles, here gold nanoparticles with\na diameter of 10 nm. The quality of the assemblies was\nassessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig\n1b). Since the strength of the optical activity critically\ndepends on the quality of the assembled structures25, we\nimproved our experimental protocol until we achieved a\nNP attachment yield of 95% and 97% per site and an\noverall yield of 70% and 80% of perfect assemblies of left\u2010\nand right\u2010handed helices with nine NPs, respectively\n(inset of Fig 1b). Most of the imperfect structures only\nexhibited a single defect within an otherwise well formed\nhelix.\nIn simple terms, the chiral response of our helical\nstructures to optical stimulation can be understood as\nfollows: due to the helical geometry of the gold\nnanoparticles, coupled plasmon waves propagate along a\nhelical path which leads to an increased absorption of\nthose components of the incident light that are in accord\nwith the handedness of the helices (Fig. 1c). Proving the\nsuccess of our approach, CD spectra measured on samples\nwith gold NP assemblies of both helicities exhibit the\ntypical signatures expected for a chiral optical response\n(Figure 2a). What is more, we find excellent agreement of\nour experimental results with theoretical calculations\nbased on classical electrodynamics. The strongest\nabsorption of circularly polarized light is predicted in the\nvicinity of the surface plasmon frequency of the metal\nnanoparticles (Fig. 2b), which is perfectly reproduced by\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2. Circular dichroism of self-assembled gold\nnanohelices. a, A dip (peak) in the CD spectrum of right\u2010 (left\u2010)\nhanded 10 nm gold particle helices becomes apparent at 524\nnm. This corresponds to the measured plasmon absorption peak\nof the samples (data not shown). Color frames indicate the\ncorrespondence between the spectra and the nanohelices\npresented in the TEM images (scale bars: 20 nm). b, The\ntheoretically predicted CD for such geometry of 10 nm gold\nnanoparticles exhibits the same features as the recorded data. c,\nThe optical activity of the nanohelices increases dramatically\nand the CD peak shifts to longer wavelengths with an increase of\nparticle size (cf. text).\n\nour assemblies. Strikingly, even the strength of the\nmeasured signals closely matches the magnitude\npredicted by the calculations.\nFrom our dipole theory20 we expected that the CD\nsignal becomes stronger when the particles are either\nlarger or arranged at a closer spacing:\n(Eq.1),\nwhere\n\nand\n\nare the particle and helix radii,\n\nrespectively. We therefore also tested the influence of\nparticle size on the CD signal by employing electroless\ndeposition of metal from solution26\u201028 onto 10 nm seeding\nparticles that were already assembled into the helical\ngeometry described in Fig. 1. CD measurements of these\n\"enhanced\" samples showed two notable effects (Fig. 2c):\ni) the signal strength increased up to 400 fold for NP\ndiameters of 16 \u00b1 2 nm, and ii) the absorption as well as\nthe CD peak shifted to longer wavelengths. These results\nare consistent with theoretical predictions for the\nplasmonic CD effect: A simple estimate for the increase of\nthe CD signal based on Eq. 1 already gives the right order\nof magnitude assuming 16 nm particle size: (16 nm/10\nnm)12 \u2248 280, while quantitative numerical calculations\n\npredict an enhancement of \u2248 500. As in the experiments,\nthe calculated CD for larger particles and the same helix\nradius is also red\u2010shifted (Fig. 2d), which is typical for\nstrongly interacting plasmonic nanocrystals29\u201031.\nThe bisignate appearance of the CD signals can be\nunderstood by considering the isotropic nature of our\nsamples, in which the nanohelices are randomly oriented\nwith respect to the direction of the incident light. The\ninteractions between the individual gold particles within\neach helix create a splitting between the longitudinal and\ntransverse modes of the electromagnetic wave, and these\nmodes typically have opposite chirality. As a result, the\nplasmonic CD spectrum acquires the characteristic dip\u2010\npeak shape.\nOur assembly method can be easily modified to\ngenerate a CD response also at other wavelengths. With\nthe intention to shift the optical response of the origami\nnanohelices, we plated silver onto pre\u2010assembled 10 nm\ngold particle helices, resulting in a silver shell of \u2248 3 nm\naround each of the gold NPs. Plasmon resonances in silver\noccur at a shorter wavelength than in gold, and as a\nconsequence the recorded CD spectra were shifted into\nthe blue spectral region (Fig. 3a). To fine\u2010tune the\nresponse to intermediate wavelengths, we further\nemployed mixtures of gold and silver ions in the plating\nsolution to achieve the growth of alloy shells around the\nseed particles. Fig. 3a also contains a TEM image and a\ncorresponding CD curve of an alloy\u2010coated structure. As\nexpected, the CD signal for the alloy helices is centered\naround an intermediate wavelength. Mixing of solutions\ncontaining different types of structures resulted in a\nlinear superposition of the corresponding spectra (Fig\n3b). These experiments clearly indicate the potential of\nour assembly method for the design and fabrication of\noptically active materials with customized spectral\nresponse.\nFinally, we set out to visualize the collective optical\nactivity of our self\u2010assembled nanohelices in a\n\"macroscopic\" optical experiment. By exposing gold NP\nhelices to excessive amounts of silver ions during\nelectroless metal deposition, we achieved a giant molar\nCD of \u2248 108 M\u20101 cm\u20101 (cf. 5\u201020 M\u20101 cm\u20101 per bp of dsDNA)\n(Fig. 3c). Droplets of such samples containing left\u2010handed\nor right\u2010handed helices were deposited next to each other\non a glass slide between two crossed linear polarizers. As\nshown in Fig. 4, the optically active fluids rotated the\npolarization of linearly polarized light depending on the\nwavelength of the incident light and the handedness of\nthe metal helices. This effect is closely related to the CD\neffect and is known as \"optical rotary dispersion\" (ORD).\nIn the case of our \"metafluids\", polarization of red light is\nrotated clockwise, whereas shorter wavelengths are\nrotated counter\u2010clockwise. As expected, a control sample\ncontaining isotropically dispersed 10 nm gold\nnanoparticles exhibited no such optical activity.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 3. Spectral tunability of optical activity. a, The plasmon\u2010frequency\u2010dominated CD response of the nanohelices can be\nshifted to shorter wavelengths by the growth of silver shells of several nanometer thickness onto the 10 nm gold nanoparticles\n(blue curve). CD response at Intermediate wavelengths can be achieved by the growth of Au\u2010Ag alloy shells (green curve). (scale\nbars: 20 nm). b, Mixing of solutions containing nanohelices of various metal compositions in one tube results in the superposition\nof the individual optical activities (solid black line: experiment; dashed black line: predicted superposition). The signal of the mixed\nfluid is rescaled to account for dilution effects due to the increase of the combined volume. c, If the metal deposition on the\nnanohelices leads to merging of the individual particles the signal strength can be increased even further (orange: left\u2010handed helix,\npurple: right\u2010handed helix). This fluid contains silver\u2010coated nanohelices at an estimated concentration of ~ 50 pM and was\nanalyzed in a cuvette with 3 mm optical pathlength. The molar CD is therefore on the order of 108 / M * cm.\n\nWe have demonstrated that the power of the DNA\norigami method allows the creation of artificial plasmonic\nmaterials with a designed and tunable optical response,\ni.e., we achieved optical activity by self\u2010assembly.\nPlasmonic circular dichroism and optical rotary\ndispersion were generated by arranging gold\nnanoparticles into helices of precisely specified geometry.\nThe optical response could be freely tuned over a large\nfraction of the visible spectral range by employing\ndifferent compositions of metals deposited on the 10 nm\ngold particles by electroless growth. Our experimental\nobservations can be quantitatively explained by\nconsidering plasmon\u2010plasmon Coulomb interactions\nwithin a nanoparticle helix. Since the materials produced\nand investigated in this study were self\u2010assembled in\n\nFigure 4. Optical rotary dispersion of self-assembled\ngold nanohelices. a, The macroscopic activity of the\nmetafluid can be demonstrated by the deposition of droplets\nof left\u2010handed and right\u2010handed nanohelices between two\ncrossed linear polarizers. b, Clockwise (top) or\ncounterclockwise (bottom) rotation of the polarizers reveals\nthe wavelength\u2010dependent optical rotation of light\ntransmitted through these droplets (Optical Rotary\nDispersion \u2013 ORD). Right\u2010handed helices rotate red light in\nthe positive direction and blue light in the negative direction.\nScale bar: 1 mm.\n\nsolution, the process is easily scalable to larger volumes\nas is required for macroscopic applications based on\nmaterials with isotropic optical activity. The potential for\nthe precise spatial arrangement of nanoparticles that\npossess specific electric or magnetic properties through\nDNA origami is immense, pointing towards the realization\nof a broad class of novel materials with artificial\nelectromagnetic properties.\nReferences\n1.
