Currently, the doped\nIII-V semiconducting nitrides, such as GaN and InN, by magnetic transition metal atoms\n(Cr, Mn, Fe ...etc) constitute promising candidates due to their predicted high (room) Curie\ntemperature [1]. However, major experimental limitations exist in this domain, such as low\nsolubility of the magnetic dopant for DMS which is related to the different crystal strcutures (between the host and the dopant) or the mismatch in resistivity for spin injection\nwhen a metallic ferromagnet and a semiconductor are joined together [2, 3]. For the cited\napplications, the late transition mononitrides, which have a metallic character, i.e. MnN,\nFeN and CoN, have recently attracted much interest (see [4] and reference therein). On the\nother side, the early ScN, TiN and VN nitrides, well known to crystalize in rocksalt (RS)\nstrcuture, were largely explored for their thermal and mechanical properties [5]. However,\nrecent progress in synthesis of stoichiometric pure ScN have reopened the debate about this\nnitride, especially for a possible use in the applications cited above. Early experiments\nreported ScN to be a semimetal [6], confirming the results [7] of density-functional theory\n(DFT) calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) [8, 9]. More recently,\nhowever, other experimental studies, by means of optical absorption, have found it as an\nindirect band gap semiconductor [10, 11, 12, 13] where a value of 0.9 eV was given by\nAl-Brithen et al [13]. After that and in order to overcome the well known drawbacks of\nthe LDA in (under)estimating the gap, several other theoretical investigations, using more\naccurate approximations going beyond the local density one, have been undertaken to explore ScN electronic structure [14, 15, 16, 17]. Based on ideas of GW approwimation [18],\nLambrecht [14] found an indirect \u0393-X gap for both GdN and ScN, with a value of 0.9 eV for\nthe latter. A full-potential calculation, using the screened-exchange local density (sX-LDA),\nhas shown that bulk ScN [16], as well as in thin films [19], is also semiconducting with an\nindirect gap of 1.58 eV in the bulk. However no gap value was provided from the surface\nstudy; nevertheless from the band structure plots, the gap value seems larger than 1.5 eV\n[19]. Very recently, Qteish et al [20] have theoretically invistigated ScN with pseudopotential calculations, using different approximations for the exchange-correlation effects. With\nmore recent quasiparticle approximation (OEP-cLDA-GW), see [20] and therein cited refer2\n\n\fences for more details, the authors again arrived at the experimental 0.9 eV gap value. It is\nimportant to note that for some authors [16, 20], the use of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), with different paramerizations, [21, 22] respectively, has led to a semimetalic\ncharacter. From the cited works, it is clear that the use of an accurate approximation of\nthe exchange-correlations effects is crucial in predicting the true energy gap, in as far as\nthis is exactly the physical quantity which is being investigated. With a lattice parameter\nof a = 4.5 \u00c5 [23, 24, 25], ScN mononitride is good lattice matched to the wide band-gap\nGaN semiconductor. Furthermore, its cubic rocksalt structure, like MnN (distorded-rocksalt\none) [26] or perhaps FeN [4], make it very attractive as a possible magnetic semiconductor\nwhen doped or substituted by magnetic atoms but. Unfortunately, only few reports are\navailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge only one recent exprimental study\non Sc(1\u2212x) Mnx N was carried out. Al-Brithen et al [27] have incorporated Mn to ScN and\nobtained Sc(1\u2212x) Mnx N nitrides solid solution up to x=0.25 with a face-centred tetragonal\nrocksalt-type structure. They found that 'ScMnN' lattice constants a and c follow linear Vegard's law going from pure ScN to pure \u03b8-phase MnN, but no magnetic data were given. On\nthe theoretical side, also the only study of Mn-doped ScN (calculations of 64 atom supercell\nof rocksalt ScN doped with a single Mn atom on a Sc site) have shown that the Mn atom\ninduces a localized state in the middle of the band-gap with a 2\u03bcB -3\u03bcB magnetic moment\n[2].\nDue to the lack of data on manganese doped ScN on one hand and in order to provide an\nimproved theoretical insight on the other hand, we carried out a comprehensive spin density\nfunctional calculation. In view of the large number of works on pure ScN , its study is briefly\nincluded here for sake of comparison and completeness. From this, the main purpose of the\npresent work is the investigation of the electronic and magnetic structures of Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N.\nBoth a cubic rocksalt (RS) and a face centered tetragonal rocksalt (fct-RS type) structures\nwere considered. The structural, electronic and magnetic properties are thus studied by\nanalyzing the calculated electronic structure, total energies and crystal field influence. Our\npaper will be organized as follows: A description of the computational details is given in\nsection 2. Our results for the calculated total energy and electronic structure of ScN are\npresented in section 3. Section 4 which is devoted to the Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N alloy is divided in\ntwo parts: in the first one the magnetic properties are discussed within the framework of\nthe Stoner theory of band ferromagnetism, while in the second one the electronic structure\n3\n\n\fis commented via partial density of states (DOS) and chemical bonding analysis. Finally a\nconclusion is given in the last section.\n\nII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nThe calculations of the present study are performed in the framework of the density functional theory [8, 9] using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew,\nBurke and Ernzerhof PBE parameterization for the effects of exchange and correlation [22].\nThis parameterization scheme was preferred over the LDA in view of its drawbacks in estimating total energies and lattice constants magnitudes.\nThe scalar-relativistic augmented spherical wave method (ASW) [28, 29] based on the\natomic sphere approximation (ASA) is mainly used. In this method, the wave function\nis expanded in atom-centered augmented spherical waves, which are Hankel functions and\nnumerical solutions of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, respectively outside and inside the so-called\naugmentation spheres. In order to optimize the basis set, additional augmented spherical\nwaves were placed at carefully selected interstitial sites. The choice of these sites as well as\nthe augmentation radii were automatically determined using the sphere-geometry optimization SGO algorithm [30]. Our choice of radii minimizing the overlap between ASA spheres\nwas as follows: rM n =1.34 \u00c5, rSc =1.36 \u00c5, rN = 1.14 \u00c5 and rES at ( 14 , 41 , 14 )=0.85 \u00c5; ES designate empty spheres with zero atomic number, introduced within the SGO algorithm. The\nbasis set consisted of Mn(4s, 4p, 3d), Sc(4s, 4p, 3d) and N(2s, 2p) valence states; ES were\ngiven basis set similar to N for allowing charge transfer. The Brillouin zone (BZ) integrations were performed with an increasing number of k-points (16x16x16) in order to ensure\nconvergence of the results with respect to the k-space grid. The convergence criterion is fixed\nto 0.001 mRy in the self-consistent procedure and charge difference \u2206 Q=10\u22124 between two\nsuccessive iterations. In order to establish a reference for the spin-polarized calculations we\nstarted with a set of spin-degenerate calculations. Such a configuration is however not relevant to a paramagnet which would only be simulated by a huge supercell entering random\nspin orientations over the different magnetic sites or alternatively by calling for disordered\nlocal moment approach, which is based on coherent potential CPA approximation [31] or\nfor the LDA+DMFT approach [32]. It allows assigning a role to the orbitals responsible of\nthe magnetic instability toward spin polarization in a mean field analysis using the Stoner\n4\n\n\ftheory of band ferromagnetism [33].\nFurther we examine the bonding using the \"Energy of Covalent Bond\" (ECOV) criterion\n[34] which merges both overlap Sij and Hamiltonian Hij (i, j being two chemical species)\nanalyses to extract chemical bonding characteristics. In ECOV plots along coordinate yaxis, a positive magnitude points to an antibonding character (destabilizing) , whereas a\nnegative value assigns a bonding character (stabilizing) of the bond.\nFor sake of completeness, we used two other complementary methods by providing\nthe electronic density of states of ScN and an optimized geometry for Sc3 MnN4 (i.e.,\nSc0.75 Mn0.25 N) lattice starting from experimental determinations using respectively a full\npotential LAPW method [35] and a pseudo-potential method [36].\n\nIII.\n\nBAND STRUCTURE OF SCANDIUM NITRIDE\n\nThe obtained numerical results for the electronic band structure of ScN are summarized in\ntable I together with some data from literature. Our calculated equilibrium lattice constant\nvalue of a = 4.5 \u00c5 is found in agreement with both experimental [23, 24, 25] and theoretical\n[16] works. The band structure is shown in figs. 1. From fig. 1-a, the valence band (VB) is\ndominated by nitrogen and one can count three p-like bands. This is illusttrated by the fat\nbands character weighted with N-2p states. An indirect \u0393-X character of the band gap (\u223c\n0.54 eV) is in agreement with recent experimental and theoretical reports but its magnitude\nis lower (see [14] and references therein). This reduced gap magnitude is due to the large\ndispersion of the bands along the \u0393-X-W direction which is generally exaggerated within\nexchange-correlation functionals based on the electron gas approximation used here. In the\nconduction band (CB), within an Oh -like crystal field, one can actually count 3 bands for\nthe t2g manifold followed at higher energy by two eg bands. The character of these bands is\nof Sc- 3d nature as shown by the fat bands as illustrated in fig. 1-b. However one can notice\na small Sc-3d weight within the VB which is a signature of the covalent bonding between\nSc and N.\nOur band structure results are confirmed by the plots of density of states (DOS). Fig.\n2-a shows the total and site projected density of states (PDOS) where the origin of energy\nis fixed at the maximum of VB. Nitrogen states are twice more intense than the Sc-3d states\nwhich are mainly empty and are found prevailing within the conduction band. They are\n5\n\n\fseparated by the energy gap. As a fact, Sc is at the beginning of the 3d transition metals\nperiod and 3d states are mainly found above EF as shown in fig. 1-b. From this only\nSc itinerant states, s, p-like, within the VB are found responsible of the mixing with N to\nensure for the chemical bonding. This illustrates the chemical picture of Sc\u03b4+ N\u03b4\u2212 with \u03b4 \u223c3,\nmeaning that the trivalent character of Sc is almost complete.\nUsing FP-LAPW within Wien2k-method [35] calculations with the same GGA functional\nfor ScN at experimental lattice constant, we also get the DOS. The calculations were carried\nwith a k point integration within the irreducible wedge of the BZ up 85 k points (2200 total\nk points) and a muffin-tin ratio rSc /rN =1,126. The DOS are shown in fig. 2-b in a narrow\nenergy window around the top of the VB. The overall shape and skyline of the VB DOS\nis very similar to the PDOS in fig. 2-a obtained by ASW calculations. A band gap of \u223c\n0.4 eV is identified and followed by a large dispersion of DOS as in fig. 2-b. The fact that\nin previous study [16] a zero gap was obtained with FLAPW calculations could be due to\nthe different choice of the muffin-tin radii of Sc and N (rSc /rN =1,7). As it is not the main\npupose of our present investigation, the reader is referred to the work of Qteish et al. [20]\nfor more details about ScN and its electronic band structure.\n\nIV.\n\nMAGNETIC\n\nPROPERTIES\n\nAND\n\nELECTRONIC\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nFOR\n\nSC0.75 MN0.25 N\nA.\n\nStructural stability and magnetic moment analysis\n\nBased on the recent experimental Sc(1\u2212x) Mnx N results [27], where a substitution up\nto x=0.25 is obtained, we have investigated the stability and magnetic properties of\nSc0.75 Mn0.25 N system. The results of this composition are obtained from calculations performed on Sc3 Mn1 N4 simple cubic cell in a face-centred lattice (drived from rocksalt ScN\nwith replacing one of the four Sc atoms in the cubic cell by Mn one). In a collective electrons\nscheme which is that of itinerant magnetism, such as the one used here, the magnetization\narises from interband spin polarization, i.e., it is mediated by the electron gas. The theoretical equilibrium volume and the structural preference of Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N are obtained by calculating the variation of the total energy versus the volume in a cubic rocksalt (RS) structure\nand in the experimental face centred tetragonal-rocksalt (fct-RS) one [27]. The instability\n\n6\n\n\ftoward magnetism in each structure can be obtained by comparing the spin-polarized (SP)\nand the non spin-polarized (NSP) total energy values at theoretical equilibrum volume.\nThe results for theoretical lattice constants, total energy and other equilibrium properties\nare summarized in table II for the two studied structures together with the experimental\ndata for the lattice constants. At self consistency little charge transfer could be observed\nbetween atomic species, mainly from Sc and Mn towards N and ES; the presence of the\nlatter allows ensuring for the covalence of the lattice by receiving small amounts of charge\nfrom N. It will be shown that the site projected DOS provide a better description of the\nquantum mixing between valence states.\nThe ferromagnetic state is largely preferred over the nonmagnetic one in the two structures. Our results from ASW computations (see table II) indicate that, like the experimental\nfinding [27], the ground state of Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N has an fct-RS structure rather than RS one\nwith a better agreement with respective experimental lattice constants\nFor the former (fct-RS), the equilibrium volume and thus the lattice constants (a and\nc) were obtained by optimizing the c/a ratio in a fixed volume and then by repeating for\ndifferent volumes from total energy calculations. The experimental lattice constants of\nSc1\u2212x Mnx N are found to decrease, as a function of Mn substitution, from ScN to \u03b8-MnN\n[27]. Note that the difference in atomic covalent radii of Sc (1.44 \u00c5) and Mn (1.39 \u00c5) may\nallow explaining the observed trend. We found an in-plane a parameter in good agreement\nwith experiment, whereas our out-of-plane one c is somewhat smaller than the reported one.\nThe structural stability of f ct-RS with respect RS has been further checked using geometry\noptimization with GGA pseudo-potentials within the VASP method [36]. Relaxation to\nzero strains confirmed through small energy differences that the tetragonal distortion RS \u2192\nf ct-RS is energetically favored.\nFor a possible instability towards an antiferromagnetic arrangement (AF), total energy\ncalculations of AF along [001] direction indicate that this AF order is less stable than the\nferromagnetic one. Structural distortions in Mn-containing compounds are often related to\nsome antiferromagnetic order. But as we have shown for the AF-[001] order, this should not\nbe the reason here because the ferromagnetic state is the most stable; at least for such low\namounts of Mn. However the presence of manganese in the trivalent matrix of ScN is likely\nto induce a nearly trivalent behavior of Mn (d4 ) which is a Jahn-Teller ion with a closely\nt32g e1g in the octahedral field of nitrogen. This argument could be in favor of the observed\n7\n\n\ftetragonal distortion of the lattice.\nThe non-spin polarized DOS of Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N are shown in Fig. 3. In this plot as well\nas in next ones, the energy reference is with respect to the Fermi level. The VB shows\nlarge contribution from nitrogen states, mainly s-like at -14 eV and p-like around -5 eV.\nThe latter are found to mix with itinerant states from both Mn and Sc. But the prevailing\nfeature of the DOS is the large intensity at EF mainly arising from Mn-d states. This\nindicates an instability towards spin polarization as it can be inferred from the Stoner's\ntheory [33] analysis. Within the Stoner theory of band ferromagnetism the large DOS at\nthe Fermi level is related to the instability of the non magnetic state with respect to the\nonset of intraband spin polarization when n(EF ).I>1. In this so called Stoner criterion I\nis the Stoner integral which, for Mn, is close to 0.43 eV [38]. With nM n (EF )= 9.9 eV\u22121 ,\nthe n(EF ).I value of 4.26 points to an unstable non magnetic state so that a large magnetic\nmoment on the Mn sites should occur when two spin populations are accounted for in the\ncalculations. As a consequence, the obtained ferromagnetic ground state is consistent with\nthe Stoner theory.\n\nB.\n\nSpin polarized electronic structure and chemical bonding\n\nThe magnetic and electronic structures are illustrated in Fig. 4, where the spin polarized densities of states (PDOS) and chemical bonding (ECOV) are plotted, for fct-RSSc0.75 Mn0.25 N alloy and indicating a metallic character. (Those corresponding to the rocksalt\nstructure are very similar and they are omitted here). From Fig. 4-a, a large exchange splitting can be noted for Mn atoms, with a nearly rigid band shift between the majority spin\n(\u2191) to lower energy and the minority spin (\u2193) to higher energy due to the gain of energy\nfrom exchange. This confirms the high magnetic moment value of 3.44\u03bcB calculated for\nMn atom. For Sc and N species, however, this splitting is almost absent (especially for\nthe former) which agrees again with the obtained values (0.01 and 0.04\u03bcB respectively). In\nthis context, we note that when the amount of Mn substitution is increased in Sc1\u2212x Mnx N\nfrom x=0.25 to x=0.75, at the same volume, complementary calculations show that the Mnmoment decreases from 3.44 to 2.99 \u03bcB respectively. This is due to the increased overlapping\nof the Mn-d orbitals when the number of Mn atoms is raised. Unfortunately, in as far as\nno experimental magnetic data are available, our present results could not be confronted\n8\n\n\fwith experiment. Nevertheless, in supercell calculations (1 Mn atom in 64 ScN supercell),\na magnetic moment of 2-3 \u03bcB was obtained [2]. The same figure shows that a large hybridization within the valence band, around -3 eV, exists between the 3d orbitals of the Mn\nand itinerant s, p states of Sc on one hand and the 2p ones of nitrogen on the other hand.\nThe important feature which should be noted in the Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N DOS, is its intensity in\nthe vicinity of the Fermi level. Although they are not completely vanishing, the Sc and N\ndensities are very low from -0.5 eV to 1 eV and there is nearly a gap of 1.5 eV were it not\nfor the presence of Mn states. However, Mn DOS are much larger in the vicinity of EF .\nWith respect to pure ScN, it seems here that the Sc and N densities around the Fermi level\nare nearly not affected by Mn substitution. From DOS curves, it can be concluded that\nthe major consequence of Mn-substitution in semiconducting ScN is to generate Mn-states\nsituated in the gap which makes the compound metallic.\nFor a better check of the chemical bonding within the nitride alloy, we show in figure\n4-b the ECOV curves representing the spin (\u2191) and spin (\u2193) populations for all atoms.\nIn this plot, the common feature for the two spin channels is their antibonding character\nat positive energies (conduction band). At the valence band, however, a difference exists.\nWhere the the spin (\u2193) interactions are entirely bonding, a sharp antibondng peak is located\njust below the EF level for the spin (\u2191) ones. This indicates roughly that the chemical bonds\nin Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N are spin resolved whereby the system is more bonded within minority spin\n(\u2193) states than within majority spin ones. These chemical bonding features agree well with\nthe densities of states analysis.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe main goal of the present work was to explore the properties of the recently grown\nMn-substituted Sc1\u2212x Mnx N with x=0.25 ternary alloys from first-principles. Using the selfconsistent DFT-based ASW method, the electronic properties of the scandium mononitride\n(ScN), which was recently found semicondctor and not semimetal as was suggested early, are\nfirstly reviewed. Structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N compound\nare then investigated. The calculated total-energy versus volume for ScN, in its known\nrocksalt structure, lead to a theoretical lattice parameter of a=4.5 \u00c5 in perfect agreement\nwith experiments. Like the recent experimental and theoretical reports, we have found ScN\n9\n\n\fas an indirect \u0393-X band gap semiconductor, but our calculated band width (0.54 eV) is\nlower than the (0.9 eV) experimentally suggested one. In view of the available theoretical\nreports, our main conclusion is that the use of an accurate approximation of the exchangecorrelations potential is crucial to predict the nature and the width of ScN gap. Concerning\nthe Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N nitride, it was considred in both: the perfect rocksalt structure and the\nexperimentally indexed face centred tetragonal-rocksalt (fct-rocksalt) one. The structural\nresults confrim the stability of the latter over the former, and a very good agreement is found\nfor the lattice constants where the calculations reproduce pefectly the experimental in-plane\na lattice constant.The out-of-plane c value is slightly lower than experiments. Magnetic\nmoments of 3.44, 0.01 and 0.04(\u03bcB ) were obtained for Mn, Sc and N atoms respectively, and\nconfirmed by the DOS plots which agree well with the rigid-band model of magnetism. With\nrespect to pristine ScN, our densities of states and chemical bonding analysis show that the\nMn-incorporation in ScN structure is responsible of the metallic character (by introducing\nMn-states at EF level). It also indicates that this does not affect significantly the original\nScN gap, where the Sc and N DOS intensities around EF remain very low. The chemical\nbonding in Sc0.75 Mn0.25 N is found to be spin resolved with a more bonded character with\nspin (\u2193) population than spin (\u2191) one.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge computational facilities provided by the M3PEC-M\u00e9socentre of the University Bordeaux 1 (http://www.m3pec.u-bordeaux1.fr), financed by the \"Conseil R\u00e9gional\nd'Aquitaine\" and the French Ministry of Research and Tecnology.
