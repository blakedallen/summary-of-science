Recent years have seen the\nidentification of continuous quantum phase transitions, or quantum critical\npoints, in a host of antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compounds. Studies of\nthe interplay between the various effects have revealed new classes of quantum critical points, and are uncovering a plethora of new quantum phases. At\nthe same time, quantum criticality has provided fresh insights into the electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties of the heavy-fermion metals. We review these developments, discuss the open issues, and outline some\ndirections for future research.\n\n1\n\n\fQuantum mechanics not only governs the subatomic world, but also dictates the organization of the microscopic particles in bulk matter at low temperatures. The behavior is strikingly\ndifferent depending on the spin (the internal angular momentum) of the constituent particles.\nParticles whose spin is an integer multiple of ~ are bosons. When cooled down to sufficiently\nlow temperatures, they will be described by the same wavefunction, thereby forming a \"condensate\". Particles whose spin is a half-integer of ~, on the other hand, are fermions satisfying\nthe Pauli exclusion principle; no two particles can have the same state. At absolute zero, they\noccupy the states with the lowest energies, up to an energy referred to as the Fermi energy. In\nthe momentum space, this defines a Fermi surface, enclosing a Fermi volume in which all the\nstates are occupied.\nWhen the particle-particle interactions are included, the behavior of such quantum systems\nbecomes even richer. These strongly correlated systems have taken the center stage in the field\nof quantum matter over the past two decades (1). High temperature superconductors, fractional\nquantum Hall systems, colossal magnetoresistive materials, and magnetic heavy-fermion metals\nare a few prominent examples. The central question for all these systems is how the electrons\nare organized, and, in particular, whether there are principles that are universal among the various classes of these strongly correlated materials. One such principle, which has come to the\nforefront in recent years, is quantum criticality (2).\nA quantum critical point (QCP) arises when matter undergoes a continuous transition from\none phase to another at zero temperature. A non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure,\ntunes the amount of zero-point motion of the constituent particles. In other words, it controls\nquantum-mechanical tunneling dictated by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, thereby changing the degree of quantum fluctuations. This is the analogue of varying the thermal fluctuations\nin the case of temperature-driven classical phase transitions, such as the melting of ice or the\nloss of ferromagnetic order in iron.\n2\n\n\fFigure 1A illustrates the temperature-pressure phase diagram observed in the heavy-fermion\nintermetallic compound CePd2 Si2 (3). At ambient pressure, CePd2 Si2 orders into an antiferromagnet, below the N\u00e9el temperature TN of about 10 K. Applying pressure reduces TN monotonically, eventually suppressing the antiferromagnetic order altogether and turning the system\ninto a paramagnetic metal. The putative critical pressure, pc , is around 2.8 GPa, where an antiferromagnetic QCP is implicated. The QCP, however, is not explicitly observed. Instead, a\n\"dome\" emerges at very low temperatures in the vicinity of pc , under which the system is a\nsuperconductor.\nThis phase diagram exemplifies a general point. It suggests that antiferromagnetic quantum criticality can provide a mechanism for superconductivity, an observation that may be of\nrelevance to a range of other strongly correlated systems such as high-Tc cuprates, organic superconductors and the recently discovered high-Tc iron pnictides. The formation of new phases\nnear a QCP may be considered the consequence of an accumulation of entropy, which is a\ngeneric feature of any QCP (4) and has recently been observed experimentally (4, 5, 6).\nA good example for such an antiferromagnetic QCP is the one observed in the compound\nYbRh2 Si2 (4). Here, the non-thermal control parameter is a (small) magnetic field. Figure\n1B brings out another important new insight that has been gained from the studies of heavyfermion antiferromagnets. Accompanying the QCP at zero-temperature is a finite parameter\nrange at non-zero temperatures in which the metallic state is anomalous (7, 8). Over this quantum critical regime, the electrical resistivity is linear in temperature \u2013 a telltale sign for an\nunusual metallic state. This non-Fermi liquid behavior (9), which goes beyond the standard\ntheory of metals, Fermi-liquid theory (10), is another phenomenon that is broadly relevant to\nthe physics of strongly correlated systems (11, 12).\nQuantum criticality has been implicated to one degree or another in a host of other heavyfermion metals (4, 13, 14). These include CeCu2 Si2 , the first superconductor to be observed\n3\n\n\famong heavy-fermion metals (15), and CeRhIn5 (16) (Figure 1C). Extensive theoretical studies\nhave led to a novel type of quantum criticality (17, 18, 19, 20). More recently, a plethora of new\nphases have been uncovered in heavy-fermion metals near a QCP (e.g., in Ir-doped YbRh2 Si2\n(8) and in \u03b2-YbAlB4 (21)). Together with the theoretical studies of the global phase diagram\nof the heavy-fermion metals (22, 2), these developments open up an entirely new frontier on the\ninterplay between quantum criticality and novel phases.\n\nQuantum Phase Transitions\nQuantum phase transitions result from the variation of quantum fluctuations. Tuning a control\nparameter at absolute zero temperature tilts the balance among the competing ground states\nassociated with conflicting interactions of quantum matter.\nHeavy-fermion metals comprise a lattice of localized magnetic moments and a band of conduction electrons (10). The exchange interaction between the local moments is primarily that\nmediated by the conduction electrons, the familiar Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY)\ninteraction. This interaction drives the local moments into an ordered pattern, much like H2 O\nmolecules are condensed into an ordered arrangement in ice. The Kondo-exchange interaction\nbetween the local moments and conduction electrons introduces spin flips, a tunneling process\nenabled by quantum mechanics. Correspondingly, increasing the Kondo interaction amounts\nto enhancing quantum fluctuations, which eventually destroys the magnetic order and yields a\nparamagnetic phase (23, 24).\nThe theory of classical phase transitions, formulated by Landau (25), is based on the principle of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Consider CePd2 Si2 at ambient pressure. In the paramagnetic phase, at T > TN , the spins are free to rotate. Upon entering the magnetically-ordered\nphase, this continuous spin-rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken; the spins must choose\npreferred orientations. In the Landau formulation, this symmetry distinction is characterized by\n4\n\n\fa quantity called order parameter; in our case, this is the staggered magnetization of the antiferromagnet. The order parameter is nonzero in the magnetically-ordered phase, but vanishes\nin the paramagnetic phase. The critical point arises when the phase transition is continuous,\ni.e., when the order parameter goes to zero smoothly. It is described in terms of the spatial\nfluctuations of the order parameter. These fluctuations occur over a characteristic length scale,\nwhich increases on approaching the critical point. At the critical point, the correlation length\nis infinite. Correspondingly, physical properties are invariant under a mathematical operation\nwhich dilates the lengths; in other words, they are scale invariant.\nA straightforward generalization of the Landau paradigm to QCPs gives rise to essentially\nthe same theoretical description (26). Quantum mechanics introduces a \"time\" axis: quantum\nstates evolve in time. (For quantum systems in equilibrium, the relevant quantum evolution is\nalong an imaginary time of length ~/kB T .) This introduces a time scale that accompanies the\ndivergent correlation-length scale. When the transition takes place at a finite temperature TN ,\n~/kB TN serves as the upper bound of the correlation time, and the ultimate critical behavior\nis still determined by the fluctuations in space only. When TN is driven to zero temperature,\nhowever, a divergent correlation time, \u03be\u03c4 , accompanies the divergent correlation length, \u03be, and\nboth must be taken into account even for equilibrium properties. Hence, the quantum critical\nfluctuations of the order parameter take place both in space and in time. The effective dimensionality of the fluctuations is d + z, where d is the spatial dimensionality and, z, the dynamic\nexponent defined in terms of the relationship \u03be\u03c4 \u221d \u03be z , describes the number of effective spatial\ndimensions that the time dimension corresponds to.\nHowever, it has been appreciated that this Landau paradigm can break down for QCPs.\nConsider the effect of the Kondo-exchange coupling. In addition to destabilizing the magnetic\norder, the Kondo interaction also introduces quantum coherence between the local moments and\nconduction electrons. Indeed, inside the paramagnetic phase, a process called Kondo screen5\n\n\fing takes place, which leads to a qualitatively new ground state in which the local moments\nand conduction electrons are entangled. Just as a continuous onset of magnetic order at zero\ntemperature introduces quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter, a critical onset\nof Kondo entanglement also yields its own quantum critical degrees of freedom. When that\nhappens, a new type of QCP ensues.\n\nKondo Effect and Heavy Fermions\nHistorically, the Kondo screening effect was introduced for dilute magnetic impurities in metallic hosts (10). By the 1970s, the notion that the Kondo phenomenon operates in a dense periodic\narray of magnetic Ce ions in intermetallic compounds, e.g. CeAl2 (27), was already in place.\nA characteristic scale, at which the Kondo screening initially sets in, is the Kondo temperature\nTK .\nThe list of heavy-fermion materials is long, and they are typically compounds containing\nrare-earths or actinides (including Yb, U, Np, in addition to Ce) with partially-filled 4f- or 5forbitals. Their defining characteristics is that the effective mass of the charge carriers at the\nlowest accessible temperatures is hundreds of times the bare electron mass.\nMicroscopically, heavy-fermion systems can be modeled as a lattice of localized f-electron\nmoments that are coupled to a band of conduction electrons. In the early 1980s, the description\nof the Kondo effect in the ground state of this Kondo lattice was formulated (10). The local moments lose their identity by forming a many-body spin singlet with all the conduction electrons,\nleading to an entangled state (Fig. 2A). The Kondo entanglement in the ground state makes the\nlocal moments, which are charge neutral to begin with, acquire the quantum numbers of the\nconduction electrons, namely spin-~/2 and charge-e. Correspondingly, \"Kondo resonances\"\nappear as charge carriers, and they remember their localized-moment origin by possessing a\nheavy mass. As the Kondo resonances are part of the electronic-excitation spectrum, they must\n6\n\n\fbe accounted for in the Fermi surface, leading to the notion of a large Fermi surface (Fig. 2B) \u2013\nthe picture of a heavy Fermi liquid.\nThe Kondo resonances can alternatively be thought of as the remnants of the original felectrons. They are de-localized because the 4f- or 5f- wavefunction has a finite overlap with\nthe ligand orbitals that form the conduction electrons. In other words, the f-electrons and conduction electrons are hybridized.\n\nQuantum Critical Points in Heavy Fermions\nTwo types of quantum critical points. The Kondo singlet in the ground state of a heavyfermion paramagnet represents an organized macroscopic pattern of the quantum many-body\nsystem (Fig. 2A). It endows the paramagnetic phase at zero temperature with a quantum order.\nThis characterization of the phase goes beyond the Landau framework. The Kondo-singlet state\ndoes not invoke any spontaneous breaking of symmetry, as the spins can orient in arbitrary\ndirections; no Landau order parameter can be associated to the Kondo effect. Two types of\nQCPs arise, depending on the behavior of the Kondo singlet as we approach the QCP from the\nparamagnetic side.\nWhen the Kondo singlet is still intact across the antiferromagnetic transition at zero temperature, the only critical degrees of freedom are the fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter.\nIn this case, the antiferromagnetically-ordered phase in the immediate proximity to the QCP\ncan be described in terms of a spin-density-wave (SDW) order of the heavy quasiparticles of\nthe paramagnetic phase. The QCP is referred to as of the SDW type, which is in the same\nclass as that already considered by Hertz (26, 28, 29, 30). On the other hand, when the Kondo\nsinglet exists only in the paramagnetic phase, the onset of magnetic order is accompanied by\na breakdown of the Kondo effect. The quantum criticality incorporates not only the slow fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order parameter, but also the emergent degrees of freedom\n7\n\n\fassociated with the breakup of the Kondo singlet. The corresponding transition is referred to as\nlocally critical (17, 18); the antiferromagnetic transition is accompanied by a localization of the\nf-electrons.\nThis distinction of the two types of QCPs can also be made in terms of energetics. The key\nquantity to consider is the energy scale E \u22c6 , which dictates the breakup of the entangled Kondo\nsinglet state as the system moves from the heavy-Fermi-liquid side towards the quantum critical\nregime. A reduction of the E \u22c6 scale on approaching the magnetic side is to be expected, as the\ndevelopment of antiferromagnetic correlations among the local moments reduces the strength\nof the Kondo singlet (17, 18, 19, 20). When E \u22c6 remains finite at the antiferromagnetic QCP,\nthe Kondo singlet is still formed, and the quantum criticality falls in the universality class of\nthe SDW type. When the E \u22c6 scale continuously goes to zero at the antiferromagnetic QCP, a\ncritical Kondo breakdown accompanies the magnetic transition. Notice that the TK scale, where\nthe Kondo screening initially sets in, is always nonzero near the QCP, even when E \u22c6 approaches\nzero.\nFigure 2 illustrates the consequence of the Kondo breakdown for the change of the Fermi\nsurface. When E \u22c6 is finite, the Kondo-singlet ground state supports Kondo resonances, and the\nFermi surface is large. When the E \u22c6 scale becomes zero, the ground state is no longer a Kondo\nsinglet and there are no fully-developed Kondo resonances. Correspondingly, the Fermi surface\nis small, incorporating only the conduction electrons.\nIn the Kondo-screened paramagnetic phase (Fig. 2A), the large Fermi surface is where the\nheavy quasiparticles are located in the momentum space (Figure 2B). As usual, such sharply defined Fermi surfaces occur below an effective Fermi temperature, TFL . Below this temperature,\nstandard Fermi-liquid properties, such as the inverse quasiparticle lifetime and the electrical\nresistivity being quadratically dependent on temperature, take place.\nIn the Kondo-destroyed antiferromagnetic phase (Fig. 2C), there is no Kondo singlet in\n8\n\n\fthe ground state and, correspondingly, static Kondo screening is absent. Kondo screening still\noperates dynamically, leading to an enhancement of the mass of the quasiparticles. The quasiparticles still have a Fermi-liquid form at low temperatures. In contrast to the case of the Kondosinglet ground state, these quasiparticles are adiabatically connected to the ordinary conduction\nelectrons and are located at the small Fermi surface (Fig. 2D).\nThe large number of available compounds is a key advantage in the study of quantum critical\nheavy-fermion systems. At the same time, it raises an important question: can we classify the\nquantum critical behavior observed in these heavy-fermion compounds? Below, we summarize\nthe evidence for such a classification in the systems that have been most extensively studied in\nthe present context.\n\nQuantum critical point of the spin-density-wave type.\n\nThe phase diagram for CePd2 Si2\n\n(Fig. 1A) (3) is reminiscent of theoretical discussions of unconventional superconductivity near\nan SDW instability. Unfortunately, because of the high pressure necessary to access the QCP in\nthis compound, it has not yet been possible to study either the order or the fluctuation spectrum\nnear the QCP. CeCu2 Si2 is an ideal system for such an investigation as, here, heavy-fermion\nsuperconductivity forms in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic QCP at ambient/low pressure.\nNeutron diffractometry revealed the antiferromagnetically-ordered state to be an incommensurate SDW with small ordered moment (about 0.1\u03bcB /Ce), due to the nesting of the renormalized\nFermi surface (31). Inelastic neutron-scattering studies on paramagnetic CeCu2 Si2 have identified fluctuations close to the incommensurate ordering wavevector of the nearby SDW and\nhave shown that such fluctuations play a dominant role in driving superconducting pairing (32),\nconfirming earlier theoretical predictions.\nAnother compound is CeNi2 Ge2 , where the magnetic instability may be achieved by slight\nvolume expansion. The critical Gr\u00fcneisen ratio in this system diverges as T \u22121 , which lends\n\n9\n\n\fsupport for a nearby SDW QCP (4).\nThere are also a few examples of magnetic quantum phase transitions induced by alloying\nwhich appear to fall in the category of the SDW QCP. In Ce1\u2212x Lax Ru2 Si2 , for instance, recent\ninelastic neutron-scattering experiments have provided such evidence near its critical concentration xc \u2248 0.075 (33).\n\nQuantum critical point involving a Kondo breakdown.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3A, inelastic\n\nneutron-scattering experiments on the quantum critical material CeCu5.9 Au0.1 revealed an energy over temperature (E/T ) scaling (34) of the dynamical susceptibility, with a fractional\nexponent (35). The same critical exponent is found to govern the magnetic susceptibility at\nwavevectors far away from the antiferromagnetic wavevector. These features are incompatible\nwith the predictions of the SDW theory (26, 28, 29, 30) and have provided the initial motivation\nfor the development of local quantum criticality (17). As such a QCP involves a breakdown of\nthe Kondo effect, it must be manifested in the charge carriers and their Fermi surfaces as well.\nDirect measurements of Fermi surfaces are typically done using the angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) spectroscopy. In spite of impressive recent developments, ARPES still\ndoes not have the resolution to study heavy-fermion metals in the required sub-Kelvin lowtemperature range. The other well-established means to probe Fermi surfaces is the de Haas-van\nAlphen (dHvA) technique which, however, requires a large magnetic field of several Teslas. A\nrare opportunity arises in CeRhIn5 , where a magnetic field of about 10 Tesla is, in fact, needed\nto suppress superconductivity and expose a quantum phase transition (Fig. 1C). From dHvA\nmeasurements performed in the field range 10-17 T, a pronounced jump in the Fermi surface\nwas seen in CeRhIn5 at the critical pressure of 2.3 GPa (36) (Fig. 3B). This, together with the\nobservation of a seemingly diverging cyclotron mass of the heavy charge carriers, is commonly\nconsidered as evidence for a Kondo-breakdown QCP (37). We caution that, for CeRhIn5 , this\n\n10\n\n\fissue remains to be fully settled; an alternative explanation based on a change of the valence\nstate of the Ce ions has also been made (38).\nThe heavy-fermion metal YbRh2 Si2 has provided an opportunity to probe the electronic\nproperties near an antiferromagnetic QCP involving a breakdown of the Kondo effect. As mentioned earlier, the very weak antiferromagnetic order of YbRh2 Si2 is suppressed by a small\nmagnetic field, giving way to non-Fermi liquid behavior (7). Furthermore, the magnetic field\ninduces a substantial change of the isothermal Hall coefficient. The latter has been shown to\nprobe, at low temperatures, the properties of the Fermi surface (39). A new temperature scale,\nT \u22c6 (B), was identified in the T \u2212 B phase diagram of YbRh2 Si2 (Fig. 1B); across this scale,\nthe isothermal Hall coefficient exhibits a crossover as a function of the applied magnetic field.\nThis crossover sharpens upon cooling. Extrapolation to T = 0 suggests an abrupt change of\nthe Fermi surface at the critical magnetic field BN , the field where TN approaches zero (39).\nFurther evidence for the inferred change of Fermi surface has come from thermotransport measurements (40). Across the T \u22c6 line, the low-temperature thermopower shows a sign change,\nsuggesting an evolution between hole-like and electron-like Fermi surfaces as illustrated in\nFig. 2B,D.\nFurther thermodynamic and transport investigations confirmed T \u22c6 (B) to be an intrinsic energy scale which vanishes at the antiferromangetic QCP (Fig. 4A) (41). The T \u22c6 scale is distinct\nfrom the Fermi-liquid scale, TFL , below which a T 2 resistivity is observed (Figure 4A). These\nproperties are naturally interpreted as signatures of a breakdown of the Kondo effect at the\nQCP, with the Fermi surface being large at B > BN (Fig. 2A,B) and being small at B < BN\n(Fig. 2C,D); T \u22c6 refers then to the temperature scale accompanying the Kondo-breakdown energy scale E \u22c6 introduced earlier. It is worth noting that the E \u22c6 scale is distinct from the aforementioned TK scale, which serves as the upper cut-off of the quantum-critical scaling regime\nand should therefore remain finite near the QCP. For instance, at the critical concentration of\n11\n\n\fCeCu6\u2212x Aux , TK has been observed in photoemission spectroscopy to be non-zero (42) even\nthough E \u22c6 is expected to vanish.\nA recent thorough study of the Hall crossover on YbRh2 Si2 single crystals of substantially\nimproved quality showed unequivocally that the width of the crossover at T \u22c6 (B) is strictly\nproportional to temperature, cf. Figure 4b (43). This indicates that the energy over temperature\nscaling also operates in this compound. Furthermore, it provides evidence that the Kondobreakdown effect indeed underlies such quantum critical scaling (43).\n\nGlobal Phase Diagram\nThe fact that, in YbRh2 Si2 , the multiple lines defining the Kondo-breakdown scale T \u22c6 , the\nFermi-liquid scale TFL , and the N\u00e9el-temperature scale TN all converge at the same magnetic\nfield in the zero-temperature limit raises the question of what happens when some additional\ncontrol parameter is varied. This global phase diagram has recently been explored by introducing chemical pressure to YbRh2 Si2 (8). The antiferromagnetic order is stabilized/weakened\nby volume compression/expansion (Fig. 4C-E), in accordance with the well-established fact\nthat pressure reinforces magnetism in Yb-based intermetallics. Unexpectedly, however, the\nT \u22c6 (B) line is only weakly dependent on chemical pressure. Under volume compression (3%\nCo-doping) the antiferromagnetic QCP occurs at a field substantially higher than B \u22c6 at which\nT \u22c6 \u2192 0 (Fig. 4E). In this situation, T \u22c6 is finite at the antiferromagnetic QCP. One therefore\nexpects that the SDW description will apply, and this is indeed observed (8). Under a small\nvolume expansion (2.5% Ir-doping), BN and B \u22c6 continue to coincide within the experimental\naccuracy (Fig. 4D). With a large volume expansion (17% Ir-doping), on the other hand, BN has\nvanished but B \u22c6 remains finite (Fig. 4C). This opens up a range of magnetic field in which not\nonly any magnetic ordering is absent, but also the Kondo-breakdown scale vanishes, suggesting a small Fermi surface. Hydrostatic-pressure experiments (44) on undoped YbRh2 Si2 give\n12\n\n\fresults comparable to those of the Co-doped materials with a similar average unit-cell volume,\nindicating that the crossing of TN (B) and T \u22c6 (B) as observed (8) for 7% Co-doped YbRh2 Si2\noriginates from the alloying-induced volume compression rather than disorder.\nThe results can be summarized in the global phase diagram shown in Fig. 4F. The transition\nfrom the small-Fermi-surface antiferromagnet to the heavy-Fermi-liquid state has three types. It\nmay go through a large-Fermi-surface antiferromagnet, as in the Co-doped cases. The transition\ncan also occur directly, as in the pure and 2.5%-Ir-doped compounds. Finally, it may go through\na small-Fermi-surface paramagnetic phase as in the case of the 6% Ir-doped YbRh2 Si2 (8). In\nthis phase, the electrical resistivity shows a quasi-linear temperature dependence (8).\nTheoretically, two kinds of antiferromagnet to heavy-Fermi-liquid transitions were already\nconsidered in the previous section. One way to connect them is to invoke a T = 0 global phase\ndiagram (22), spanned by two parameters associated with two types of quantum fluctuations.\nOne parameter, JK , describes the Kondo coupling between the conduction electrons and the\nlocal moments; increasing JK enhances the ability of the conduction electrons to screen the\nlocal moments and thereby reduces the magnetic order. The other parameter, G, is associated\nwith the interactions among the local moments and refers to, for instance, the degree of geometric frustration (45) or simply the dimensionality (17, 46); raising the parameter G boosts the\ninherent quantum fluctuations of the local-moment system and, correspondingly, weakens the\nmagnetism. In the two-parameter global phase diagram of Ref. (22), each kind of transition\nappears as a line of critical points: one line is associated with local quantum criticality, with the\nbreakdown of the Kondo effect occurring at the antiferromagnetic-ordering transition; the other\none is associated with SDW quantum criticality, in which case the Kondo breakdown can only\ntake place inside the antiferromagnetically-ordered region. This is consistent with Fig. 4F, in\nwhich BN and B \u22c6 coincide for a finite range of small Ir-concentrations. The extension of this\nglobal phase diagram is currently being actively pursued theoretically (2). When the quantum\n13\n\n\ffluctuations among the local moments are even stronger, a possibility exists for a paramagnetic\nphase with a suppressed Kondo entanglement and a concomitant small Fermi surface; this can\nbe compared with the region highlighted by the question marks in Fig. 4F. This phase could be\na spin liquid, or could be an ordered state (such as a spin-Peierls phase) which preserves the\nspin-rotational invariance. Understanding the nature of the novel phase represents an intriguing\nproblem worthy of further studies, both theoretically and experimentally.\nOther heavy-fermion systems may also be discussed in this two-parameter global phase\ndiagram. The zero-temperature transition in CeCu6\u2212x Aux as a function of doping or pressure\ncan be described in terms of local quantum criticality. As a function of magnetic field, for\nboth CeCu6\u2212x Aux (47) and CeIn3 (48), the Kondo breakdown seems to take place inside the\nantiferromagnetic part of the phase diagram. It will be instructive to see whether other heavyfermion materials can be used to map the global phase diagram and, in particular, display a\nparamagnetic non-Fermi liquid phase near a Kondo-breakdown QCP.\n\nConclusions and Outlook\nStudies in the last decade have firmly established the existence of quantum critical points in\nheavy-fermion metals. These transitions arise from the suppression of long-range antiferromagnetic ordering by tuning pressure, chemical composition or magnetic field. An important property of quantum critical points is the accumulation of entropy. Correspondingly, the Gr\u00fcneisen\nratio or the magnetocaloric effect diverges, which serves as an important thermodynamic characterization of the quantum critical points.\nTwo types of quantum critical points have been developed for antiferromagnetic heavyfermion systems.\n\nWhen a breakdown of the Kondo entanglement occurs inside the\n\nantiferromagnetically-ordered phase, the quantum critical point has the standard spin-densitywave form which conforms to Landau's paradigm of order-parameter fluctuations. When such\n14\n\n\fa Kondo breakdown happens at the onset of antiferromagnetism, a new class of quantum critical\npoint arises. Evidence for this local quantum criticality has come from the quantum-dynamical\nscaling and mass divergence in CeCu6\u2212x Aux and YbRh2 Si2 , the multiple energy scales observed\nin YbRh2 Si2 , and the jump of the Fermi surface in YbRh2 Si2 and CeRhIn5 .\nA strong case has been made that, in CeCu2 Si2 , the critical fluctuations of a spin-densitywave quantum critical point promote unconventional superconductivity. It is likely that the\nsuperconductivity in CePd2 Si2 has a similar origin. Whether the Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical points also favor superconductivity is less clear. CeRhIn5 under pressure and \u03b2YbAlB4 could be examples in this category, although the nature of quantum critical points in\nthese systems remains to be firmly established.\nMore recent studies have focused attention, both experimentally and theoretically, on the\nglobal phase diagram of antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion metals. Tantalizing evidence has\nemerged for a non-Fermi liquid phase without any magnetic ordering and with suppressed\nKondo entanglement. Whether such a state can, in fact, arise within the Kondo-lattice model is\nan intriguing open theoretical question. In the process of addressing such issues, it is becoming clear that quantum fluctuations in heavy-fermion systems can be tuned in more ways than\none. Different phases and quantum critical points may arise when a magnetic disordering is\ninduced by the Kondo coupling between the local moments and conduction electrons, or when\nit is caused by reduced dimensionality and/or magnetic frustration.\nTheoretically, an important notion which has emerged from studies in heavy-fermion systems is that quantum criticality can go beyond the Landau paradigm of fluctuations in an order\nparameter associated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking. This notion has impacted the\ndevelopments on quantum criticality in other systems, including insulating magnets. More generally, quantum criticality in heavy-fermion metals epitomizes the richness and complexity of\ncontinuous quantum phase transitions compared to their classical counterparts. New theoretical\n15\n\n\fmethods are needed to study strongly coupled quantum critical systems. One promising new\nroute is provided by an approach based on quantum gravity (49). Using a charged black hole\nin a weakly-curved spacetime to model a finite density of electrons, this approach has provided\na tantalizing symmetry reason for some fermionic spectral quantities to display an anomalous\nfrequency dependence when its momentum dependence is smooth. Whether a related symmetry principle underlies the dynamical scaling of the spin response at the Kondo-breakdown local\nquantum criticality is an intriguing issue for future studies.\nThe insights gained from these studies on the well-defined quantum critical points in various\nheavy-fermion metals have implications for other members of this class of materials as well as\nfor other classes of strongly correlated electronic systems. For example, an outstanding issue\nis the nature of the hidden-order phase in the heavy-fermion compound URu2 Si2 (50, 51). This\nphase is in proximity to some low-temperature magnetically-ordered phases, raising the question of the role of quantum phase transitions in this exciting system. In the cuprates, Fermisurface evolution as a function of doping has also been playing a prominent role in recent\nyears. In light of the discussions on the possible role of doping-induced quantum critical points,\nit appears likely that some of the physics discussed for heavy-fermion quantum criticality also\ncomes into play in the cuprates (52). For the iron pnictides, the magnetic/superconducting phase\ndiagram has also been observed to show a striking resemblance to Figure 1A. The interplay between magnetic quantum criticality, electronic localization, and unconventional superconductivity, which has featured so prominently in the systems considered here, is likely pertinent to\nheavy-fermion metals in general as well as other classes of correlated-electron materials, including the iron pnictides and organic charge-transfer salts. Finally, quantum phase transitions\nare also being discussed in broader settings, such as ultra-cold atomic gases and quark matter.\nIt is conceivable that issues related to our discussion here will come into play in those systems\nas well.\n16\n\n\fReferences and Notes\n1.

TN is the N\u00e9el transition temperature, and the corresponding antiferromagnetic order is illustrated in the inset. At the boundary of the antiferromagnetism, a phase of unconventional superconductivity arises. Tc corresponds to the superconducting transition temperature. (From Ref. (3).) (B) Field-induced quantum phase transition in\nYbRh2 Si2 . The blue regions label the Fermi-liquid behavior observed by measurements of electrical resistivity and other transport and thermodynamic properties; they correspond to T < TN\nat B < BN , and T < TFL at B > BN , where BN is the critical field at T = 0. The orange region\ndescribes non-Fermi liquid behavior that is anchored by the quantum critical point at B = BN .\n(From Ref. (7).) The T \u22c6 line delineates crossover behavior associated with the destruction of\nthe Kondo effect, as described in the main text. (From Ref. (8).) (C) The pressure-field phase\ndiagram at the lowest measured temperature (T = 0.5 K) in CeRhIn5 . The antiferromagnetic\norder, denoted by MO, at ambient pressure gives way to superconductivity, specified by SC, at\nhigher pressures. At B = 0, the antiferromagnetic order goes away when the pressure exceeds\nP1 . When the magnetic field exceeds just enough to suppress superconductivity, the system is\nantiferromagnetically ordered at lower pressures, P < P2 , but yields a non-magnetic phase at\nhigher pressures, P > P2 . The hatched line refers to the transition at P2 , between these two\nphases. (From Ref. (37).)\n\nFigure 2: Kondo entanglement and its breakdown in heavy-fermion metals. (A) Kondo-singlet\nground state in a paramagnetic phase, giving rise to a heavy Fermi liquid. The blobs with\norange arrows mark the mobile conduction electrons, while the thick black arrows denote localized magnetic moments. The purple profile describes the Kondo singlet in the ground state.\n(B) The Kondo singlet in the ground state gives rise to Kondo resonances, which must be incorporated into the Fermi volume. Correspondingly, the Fermi surface is large, with a volume that\nis proportional to 1 + x, where 1 and x, respectively, refer to the number of local moments and\nconduction electrons per unit cell. An SDW refers to an antiferromagnetic order which develops\nfrom a Fermi-surface instability of these quasiparticles. (C) Kondo breakdown in an antiferromagnetic phase. The local moments arrange into an antiferromagnetic order among themselves,\nand they do not form static Kondo singlets with the conduction electrons. (D) Kondo resonances\ndo not form in the absence of static Kondo screening. Correspondingly, the Fermi surface is\nsmall, enclosing a volume in the paramagnetic zone that is proportional to x. Dynamical Kondo\nscreening, however, still operates, giving rise to an enhancement of the quasiparticle mass near\nthe small Fermi surface.\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 3: Quantum critical properties of CeCu6\u2212x Aux and CeRhIn5 . (A) Quantum-dynamical\nE/T scaling of the inelastic neutron-scattering cross section S in CeCu5.9 Au0.1 . The measurements were performed at the antiferromagnetic wavevectors (where S is maximized), and the\nscaling collapse is constructed in the form of T \u03b1 S as a function E/T . The temperature and\nenergy exponent is fractional: \u03b1 = 0.75. The different symbols represent data taken in different\nspectrometers at the different peak wavevectors. Inset: The inverse of the bulk magnetic susceptibility, 1/\u03c7(q = 0) \u2261 H/M, and that of the static susceptibility at other wavevectors derived\nfrom the dynamical spin susceptibility through the Kramers-Kronig relation.
