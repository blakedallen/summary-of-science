This is important\nfor applications such as molecular angular momentum alignment as well as for the measurement\nof the transition dipole moment matrix element.\nPACS numbers: 33.40. +f, 42.50.Hz\n\n1\n\n\fStudies of coherence and quantum interference effects [1] such as Autler-Townes (AT)\nsplitting and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic and molecular systems have attracted a great deal of attention, because they yield a number of important\npotential applications including production of slow light [2], lasing without inversion [3],\npulse matching effects [4] and control of the index of refraction [5]. EIT was demonstrated\nfor the first time by Boller et al. [6] in an atomic \u039b-type Strontium system. It renders\nan otherwise optically thick medium transparent to a weak laser field. Most of the previous theoretical and experimental work on EIT is based on various three-level closed atomic\nsystems with different energy level configurations using both pulsed and continuous wave\n(cw) lasers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. To overcome inhomogeneous Doppler broadening it is generally\nexpected that high coupling field intensities are required for observation of AT splitting and\nEIT. Nevertheless, it has been shown that with proper selection of experimental parameters\nand beam geometry it is possible to overcome this difficulty and to demonstrate these effects\nin both atomic [8] and molecular systems [12, 13, 14] with coupling field Rabi frequencies\nproduced by commercially available cw lasers.\nIn our previous papers [12, 13] we emphasized that the AT effect can be used to directly\nmeasure the absolute value of the molecular transition dipole moment as well as to facilitate\ncontrol of molecular angular momentum alignment. In this Letter we investigate the role of\nthe inhomogeneous line broadening and how it affects the AT splitting in the fluorescence\nspectrum of levels |2i and |3i in a 3-level open molecular cascade system, when the coupling\nfield is on resonance with the |2i \u2212 |3i rovibronic transition. We have observed that the fluorescence line shape originating from the uppermost level of the cascade excitation scheme\ncritically depends on the probe laser/coupling field wavenumber ratio, while at the same\ntime the fluorescence line shape observed from the intermediate level is hardly affected at\nall. Based on our theoretical analysis to explain these observations, we provide here a description of the optimal conditions for AT splitting in terms of the coupling field wavenumber\ncompared to that of the probe laser as well as their relative propagation direction.\nFor the experimental set up adopted in our study we refer the reader to [12] and [13].\nSchematic illustrations of the Na2 energy levels for the cascade configuration discussed here\nare displayed in the two panels of Fig. 1 Case a) illustrates a situation in which the absolute\nvalue of the ratio k1 /k2 of the probe laser wave number to that of the coupling field is smaller\nthan unity. We define this ratio as positive for co-propagating beams and negative for the\n2\n\n\f|3>\nL2\nL2\n\n|4>\n\n|4>\n\n|2>\nL1\n\n|5>\n\n|5>\n\nL1\nCase a)\n\n|1>\n\nCase b)\n\nFIG. 1: The Na2 cascade excitation scheme for two different probe laser/coupling field wavenumber\nratio x = k1 /k2 , where k1 is the weak probe laser (thin arrow) and k2 is the strong coupling field\n(thick arrow). In case (a) this ratio is smaller than 1 and in case (b) it is larger than 1. The\n1 +\n1\nenergy levels chosen for case a) are: |1i = X 1 \u03a3+\ng (0,19), |2i = A \u03a3u (0,20), |3i = 2 \u03a0g (0,19), |4i =\n1 +\n1 +\n1 +\nA1 \u03a3+\nu (0,18) or A \u03a3u (0,20), and |5i = X \u03a3g (3,21). Those for case b) are: |1i = X \u03a3g (1,19), |2i\n1 +\n1 +\n1 +\n= A1 \u03a3+\nu (3,18), |3i = 4 \u03a3g (0,17), |4i=A \u03a3u (1,16) and |5i = X \u03a3g (2,19). The laser frequencies\n\nfor transitions |1i to |2i and |2i to |3i are L1 (14647.547 cm\u22121 ) and L2 (15888.065 cm\u22121 ) for case\na) and L1 (14828.639 cm\u22121 ) and L2 (13284.554 cm\u22121 ) for case b). Single channel side fluorescence\nwavenumbers were 15771.91\u00b10.3 cm\u22121 and 14167.36\u00b10.3 cm\u22121 for case a) transitions |3i to |4i\nand |2i to |5i, respectively. These values were 13522.93\u00b10.3cm\u22121 and 14672.59\u00b10.3cm\u22121 for case\nb). The lifetimes are 12.2ns for level |2i in cases a) and b) [15], and 21.0ns and 12.7ns for level |3i\nin cases a) and b) [16, 17, 18, 19].\n\ncounter propagating configuration. In case b) the absolute value of the k1 /k2 ratio is greater\nthan one instead. In addition to obeying this constraint on the transition frequencies, the\nselected energy levels were chosen to allow the generation of the largest Rabi frequency of\nthe coupling field, given the available laser sources [narrowband frequency stabilized dye and\nTitanium Sapphire lasers (Coherent Autoscan 699-29 and 899-29)]. Intermediate level |2i\n1\nbelongs to the Na2 A1 \u03a3+\nu state and the uppermost level belongs to the 2 \u03a0g state in case a)\n\nand to the 41 \u03a3+\ng state in case b), respectively, as indicated in the caption of Fig. 1, where,\nin addition, we provide the fluorescence detection wavelengths in wavenumber units. With\nthe coupling laser tuned to resonance, we scanned the probe laser and detected fluorescence\nfrom level |2i and from level |3i by isolating the desired fluorescence from the background\nradiation with a Spex 1404 double monochromator used as a narrow band filter.

The dotted line represents the simulations.\n\ncases a) and b) the fluorescence from the intermediate level |2i displayed the EIT pattern\nexpected in an open molecular system [12] as illustrated in Figs. 2 a) and b). However,\nthe AT splitting, which is generally present in the fluorescence spectrum from level |3i for\na sufficiently large coupling field Rabi frequency, is quite sensitive to the wavenumber ratio\nx = k1 /k2 . In case a) when the absolute value of this ratio is smaller than unity, we observed\na clear AT splitting, as shown in Fig. 3a, whereas in case b) with |k1 /k2 | > 1, we did not\nobserve evidence of this effect at all (see Fig. 3b).The Rabi frequencies of the coupling field\nwere 400MHz and 530MHz in case a) and b),respectively. Thus case b) should be more\nfavorable for the observation of AT splitting with regard to this parameter.\nWe simulated the experimental data by using stationary solutions of the density matrix\nequations of motion as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Our Rabi frequencies were 6 MHz and 400\n\n4\n\n\fMHz for the probe and coupling fields, respectively, for case a) and 36 MHz and 530 MHz\nfor case b). These values were determined from the calculated transition dipole moment\nmatrix elements [17], Franck Condon factors for known molecular potentials [16, 18, 19]\nand the measured E field amplitude in the interaction region [20]. Our results show that\nthe presence (or absence) of a splitting in the fluorescence spectrum of the upper level |3i\ndepends in a sensitive way on the wavenumber ratio of the probe and coupling field lasers.\nAs we explain below, the origin of this result is the Doppler broadening.\nIn order to gain physical insight into the behavior of the system we used the perturbative\nmodel discussed by Qi et al. in Ref. [12] for an open molecular cascade system. We have\ninvestigated the conditions under which the fluorescence spectrum from level |3i displays\nthe experimentally observed shown behavior in Figs. 3a. and 3b. The calculated Doppler\naveraged fluorescence spectrum from the upper level |3i (summed over the magnetic sublevels\nof the |2i \u2192 |3i transition), as a function of the detunings \u22061 = \u03c921 \u2212 \u03c91 + k1 vz and\n\u22062 = \u03c932 \u2212 \u03c92 + k2 vz of the probe and coupling fields, respectively, is given by\nX Z +\u221e\nI3 (\u22061 , \u22062 ) =\n\u03c1M\n33 (vz )N(vz )dvz ,\nM\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere z is the axis of propagation of the laser beams, v z is the z-component of the thermal\nvelocity of the molecules, N (v z ) is the Gaussian velocity distribution, and \u03c133 is the analytical\nexpression for the population of level |3i, given in Ref. 12. We were able to carry out the\nintegration of the Doppler integral analytically. However, the details of this calculation with\nthe full result will be reported elsewhere [21], because of the complexity of the mathematical\nexpressions and the limited space of the current manuscript. Based on this calculation\nthe intensity of the fluorescence spectrum I3 (\u22061 , \u22062 ) from level |3i is proportional to the\nfollowing factors:\nI3 (\u22061 , \u22062 ) \u221d\n\nw(zi )\n,\nz1 \u2212 z2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere w(zi ) is the Faddeeva function [22] and z1 and z2 are the roots of the denominator of\n\u03c133 (\u22061 , \u22062 ) from Ref. [12]. Our analysis indicates that the behavior of I3 stems from the\ntwo factors, w(zi ) and (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22121 .\nBased on the analytically calculated I3 (\u22061 , \u22062 ) we have derived expressions for the threshold Rabi frequency \u03a9T2 as a function of the ratio k1 /k2 above which AT splitting can be\nexperimentally observed.

This corresponds to a configuration in which the probe and coupling laser beams counter-propagate\nand |k1 /k2 | is smaller than unity. The dots in the figure identify the values of the k1 /k2\nratio that were used in our experiments. We have also investigated the dependence of this\nthreshold \u03a9T2 on the inhomogeneous Doppler linewidth \u2206\u03bdD . The 3 dimensional plot of\nFig. 5 shows a simulation with the same parameters as Fig. 4 where the 3rd dimension is\nrepresented by \u2206\u03bdD . The threshold Rabi frequency \u03a9T2 grows very rapidly with increasing\nDoppler linewidth in the region k1 /k2 < \u22121 and k1 /k2 > 0 and has no \u2206\u03bdD dependence at\nall in region \u22121 < k1 /k2 < 0. This result is unexpected, and quite interesting.

In this region only\na moderate coupling field Rabi frequency is required to split the experimental Optical Optical Double Resonance (OODR) spectrum and to observe the AT effect independent of the\n7\n\n\fDoppler linewidth \u2206\u03bdD . In order to explain this behavior we have to consider the expression\nfor I3 (\u22061 , \u22062 ) in Eq.2. First for \u22121 < x < 0 our analysis [21] shows that the splitting is\nmainly determined by:\n1\n\n2x(1 + x)[(\u22061 \u2212 i\u0393)2 + x(1 + x)\u03a922 ] 2\n1\n=\n1\nz1 \u2212 z2\n[(\u220621 \u2212 \u03932 + x(1 + x)\u03a922 )2 + 4\u03932 \u220621 ] 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u0393 is defined as \u0393 = \u03b312 (1 + x) \u2212 \u03b313 x.\nThis expression is independent of \u2206\u03bdD . Therefore the threshold \u03a9T2 becomes independent of\nthe Doppler linewidth. This has an important physical implication in that the AT splitting\nwill be equally well resolved independent of the magnitude of the Doppler broadening \u2206\u03bdD .\nOn the contrary, in the region where the ratio is x < \u22121 or x > 0 the AT splitting and the\nthreshold value of \u03a9T2 are determined by\n2\n\nw(zi ) \u221d e\u2212zi \u221d e\n\n\u2212\n\nf (\u03a92 ,x,\u03b3ij )\n(\u2206\u03bdD )2\n\n(5)\n\nfor sufficiently large |zi |, indicating a strong dependence on \u2206\u03bdD . Thus the increase in the\nvalue of \u2206\u03bdD leads to a rapid increase in the threshold Rabi frequency \u03a9T2 . This explains\nwhy the experimental spectrum in Fig. 3 does not show AT splitting, since our available\ncoupling Rabi frequency was 300\u223c350MHz, while the required value is of the order of a\nGHz, for this particular experiment.\nIn conclusion, our experimental results show profoundly different behavior of the AT\nsplitting in the spectra from the upper level in a Doppler broadened open molecular cascade\nsystem, while the fluorescence spectrum emanating from the intermediate level is almost\nunaffected. We have shown that this unexpected behavior is based on the presence of\nDoppler broadening and that it is strongly dependent on the ratio of the probe and coupling\nlaser wavenumbers. By analyzing the dependence of the threshold Rabi frequency \u03a9T2 on\nthe probe laser-coupling field wavenumber ratio and the Doppler linewidth \u2206\u03bdD we have\nprovided an overview of the optimal conditions for observing AT splitting in this excitation\nscheme.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation Awards PHY 0245311 and PHY\n0216187.
