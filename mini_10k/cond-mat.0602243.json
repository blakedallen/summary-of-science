There has been particular interest in non-local\neffects whereby layers separated from a magnetic layer influence its magnetization dynamics\nthrough non-magnetic (NM) metallic contact layers, i.e., via conduction electrons. Such\neffects were modeled and studied in the early 1970's by Silsbee et al. [1]. More recently, a\nscattering theory approach has been employed to describe the enhancement of the damping\n[2, 3]. There have also been experiments [4, 5, 6] which indicate quantitative agreement with\nthis theory based on interface parameters that can be determined from ab-initio calculations\n[7] as well as transport experiments [8].\nThe current interest in this mechanism is at least threefold. First, it is a fundamental\nmechanism of damping that can provide important information on interface and bulk spin\ndiffusion. Second, the effect is known to play an important role in current-induced magnetization excitations in spin-transfer devices [9]. In such devices, a few nanometer thick\nmagnetic layer is embedded between NM layers which separate it from a thick ferromagnetic layer that sets the spin-polarization of the current [10]. The threshold current density\nfor magnetic excitations is proportional to the damping [11]. In order to understand the\nphysics of spin transfer, it is therefore important to investigate the effect of adjacent NM\nlayers on the magnetic relaxation of ultra-thin films. Finally, from a technological point\nof view, this process provides a way to engineer the damping, which is important for high\nspeed magneto-electronic devices.\nMizukami et al. studied the Gilbert damping of sputtered NM|t Py|NM films as a function\nof the FM layer thickness (2 \u2264 t \u2264 10 nm) and for different adjacent non-magnetic metals\nNM=Cu, Pd and Pt using a X-band FMR technique [4]. The damping was found to be\nconsistent with the spin pumping picture: increasing with decreasing Py thickness for the\nfilms with NM=Pt and Pd only. Further, the magnetization damping of Cu|Py|L Cu|Pt\nstructures as a function of Cu layer thickness L and with fixed Py thickness, showed evidence\nfor a non-local effect. However, the non-local damping has been studied mainly in NM|t\nFM|NM structures as a function of the FM layer thickness and varying the material directly\nin contact with the FM layer [4, 6]. There have also been no experimental studies of\n2\n\n\fpolycrystalline Co layers, which are widely used in spin-transfer devices.\nIn this paper, we report systematic studies of the thickness dependence of the linewidth\nand Gilbert damping of ultra-thin Co layers in ||y1 Pt|Cu|t Co|Cu|y2 Pt|| structures. The\nthickness of the Cu layers in contact with Co is kept fixed at 10 nm, which is chosen to\nbe less than the spin-diffusion length in Cu. The Pt layers have no direct interface with\nthe FM layer. The structure is modified by removing one or both of the Pt layers (y1 or\ny2 = 0). The observation of changes in the Gilbert damping confirm the non-local nature\nof this damping mechanism and the data allow for quantitative analysis of the interface\nspin-mixing conductances in the scattering theory approach.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II, the film fabrication and the FMR\nsetup are described. Section III explains the method of analysis of the resonance field and\nlinewidth. In section IV, the resonance field and the effective demagnetization field are\nstudied as a function of Co layer thickness. The FMR linewidth and the Gilbert damping\ndata are presented. This is followed by a discussion of the dependence of the Gilbert damping\non the Co layer thickness for films with and without Pt and a quantitative analysis of the\ndata.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE\n\nFour series of films were fabricated with the layer structure ||y1 Pt|10 nm Cu |t Co|10\nnm Cu|y2 Pt|| on GaAs substrates. First, symmetric structures with a variable thickness\nof Co between Pt and Cu layers were grown with y1 = y2 = 1.5 nm and 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 nm.\nThe second set of samples were asymmetric, without the top Pt layer (y1 = 1.5 nm and\ny2 = 0), and with Co of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 nm thickness. In addition, films without Pt layers\n(y1 = y2 = 0), with Co of 2 and 3 nm thickness were fabricated. In the fourth and final\nset of films, the thickness of the Pt layers was varied from 0 to 5 nm in a symmetric way\nwith y1 = y2 = 0, 1.5, 3 and 5 nm with a fixed Co layer thickness of t = 2 nm. Note that\nthe studies in which Pt layer thicknesses were varied focused on thin Co layers because the\nnon-local effect on the damping were found to be significant only in Co layers thinner than\n4 nm.\nFilms were prepared by a combination of electron-beam (Co, Pt) and thermal (Cu)\nevaporation in an UHV system at a base pressure of 5\u00d710\u22128 Torr on polished semi-insulating\n3\n\n\f1.5\n\nNormalized intensity\n\nCo\n\nCu\n\nPt\n\n1.0\n\nt = 6 nm\n\n0.5\nt = 3 nm\n\nt = 1.5 nm\n\n0.0\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n-1\n\nQ (\u00c5 )\n\nFIG. 1: X-ray data of ||Pt|Cu|t Co|Cu|Pt|| films with t =1.5, 3 and 6 nm. The curves for the films\nwith 3 and 6 nm Co layer were shifted up for clarity. The vertical solid, dashed and dotted lines\nshow the Q for nominal fcc Pt, Cu and Co respectively.\n\n4 \u00d7 6 mm2 GaAs wafers. Note that the chamber is equipped of an in-situ wedge growth\nmechanism that enables the fabrication of a number of samples with different Co or Pt\nthickness in the same deposition run, without breaking vacuum. The evaporation rate for\nCo and Cu were 0.5 and 0.8 \u00c5/sec respectively.\nX-ray measurements were conducted on ||Pt|Cu|t Co|Cu|Pt|| with t = 1.5, 3 and 6 nm\n(Fig. 1). The reflectivity scans were taken at 19 keV using a Bicron point detector. The\nintensity was first normalized by a beam-monitoring ion chamber, and then each scan was\nrescaled to reach a maximum of one. The films are polycrystalline and Pt, Cu and Co have\nan fcc structure with (111) as the crystallographic growth direction. Note that the peak at\nQ\u223c 3 \u00c5\u22121 shifts slightly between the (111) nominal values for Co and Cu depending on how\nmuch Co is present. An undistorted bcc (the most intense peak of 110 for Co would be at\n3.15 \u00c5\u22121 ) is clearly not present, but a distorted bcc with a lattice of 2.8 \u00c5 cannot be ruled\nout. Note that the peak of intensity at Q \u2248 2.79 \u00c5 from the Pt layer is strong evidence\nagainst interdiffusion at the Pt|Cu interface.\nThe surface topography of the films ||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|| and ||Cu|Co|Cu|| were studied using\nnon-contact Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2). From the analysis of the AFM\nimages, a rms roughness of \u03c3 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 nm was found for films with Pt underlayer and\n\u03c3 = 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 nm for films without Pt. The lateral correlation length were \u03be = 19.6 \u00b1 1.7\n\n4\n\n\f10\n\nY Axis Title\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: Grey scale images of AFM scans performed on 1 \u03bcm2 areas of a magnetic film (a)\n||Cu|Co|Cu|| and (b) ||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|| with a Co layer of 2 nm thickness. The rms values of surface\nroughness is \u03c3 = 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 nm for (a) and \u03c3 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 nm for (b), and the lateral correlation\nlength is \u03be = 18.0 \u00b1 0.4 nm and \u03be = 19.6 \u00b1 1.7 nm respectively.\n\nnm and \u03be = 18.0 \u00b1 0.4 nm respectively. There is no clear difference in the rms roughness\nand the correlation length of the film with and without Pt, suggesting that 1.5 nm Pt does\nnot alter the growth of the subsequent Cu|Co|Cu trilayers. The rms roughness is about 6%\nof the film thickness, which is typical of films prepared by evaporation.\nFMR measurements were conducted in an in-plane field geometry at room temperature\nemploying a coplanar waveguide (CPW) as an ac magnetic field generator and inductive\nsensor [12]. The CPW was fabricated on a 350 \u03bcm thick semi-insulating and polished GaAs\nwafer from a 200 nm thick Au film patterned using bi-layer photolithographic process. It\nis characterized by a transmission line of 50 \u03bcm width, a gap to the ground plate of 32 \u03bcm\nand a length of 4 mm, which is designed to have 50 \u03a9 impedance above 4 GHz. The CPW\nwas placed into a brass cavity, with its ends connected directly to the ports of a Network\nAnalyzer. Care was taken to avoid magnetic components in the cavity and in all contacts\nto the CPW. FMR spectra were measured by placing the magnetic sample metal face down\non the CPW and sweeping the external magnetic field at fixed microwave frequency while\nmeasuring the S-parameters of the transmission line. Our setup enables measurement of the\nFMR response of Co layers as thin as 1 nm.

The resonance fields were\nalways in agreement with the readings from the Gaussmeter within 10-15 Gauss.\nThe FMR response was recorded at different frequencies in the range 4-25 GHz. The\nspectra is measured as the relative change in the transmitted power versus applied field. At\n13 GHz for example, the absorption from 5 nm thick Co film at resonance leads to a 0.66%\ndecrease in the transmission. Thus, the susceptibility of the magnetic films only causes a\nsmall change in the impedance of the CPW and the absorption line can be analyzed as a\nsmall perturbation to the CPW transmission.\n\nIII.\n\nMETHOD OF ANALYSIS OF THE RESONANCE FIELD AND LINEWIDTH\n\nThe dynamics of the magnetization can be described in the classical limit by the LandauLifshitz equation of motion:\n~\n~\n1 \u2202M\n~ \u00d7 \u2202M ,\n~ \u00d7H\n~ eff + G M\n=M\n\u03b3 \u2202t\n\u03b3 2 Ms2\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\n~ eff is the effective field, M\n~ is the magnetization vector and G is the Gilbert damping\nwhere H\nconstant. The gyromagnetic ratio, \u03b3 = g\u03bcB /~, is proportional to g, the Land\u00e9 gyroscopic\nfactor. For a film magnetized in the film plane in an ac field, the resonance condition is [13]:\n\n6\n\n\f\u0012\n\n2\u03c0f\n\u03b3\n\n\u00132\n\n= Hres (Hres + 4\u03c0Meff ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere for a continuous film, the effective demagnetization field is given by:\n4\u03c0Meff = 4\u03c0Ms +\n\n2Ks\n.\nMs t\n\n(3)\n\nMs is the saturation magnetization. The uniaxial anisotropy field Hs = 2Ks /Ms t is characterized by a 1/t thickness dependence, where the anisotropy originates from interface and/or\nstrain-magnetoelastic interactions. If Ks , the uniaxial anisotropy constant, is negative, Hs is\ndirected out-of the film plane, corresponding to a perpendicular component to the magnetic\nanisotropy. Note that by assuming Ms is independent of thickness the uniaxial anisotropy\nconstant, extracted from 4\u03c0Meff versus t, can be overestimated.\nThe Gilbert damping is determined by the frequency dependence of the FMR linewidth\n\u2206H [14]:\n\u2206H(f ) = \u2206H0 +\n\n4\u03c0G\nf,\n\u03b3 2 Ms\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the slope of \u2206H(f ) is the intrinsic contribution to the linewidth, and is proportional\nto the Gilbert damping constant G. \u2206H0 , the zero-frequency intercept, is usually considered\nto be an extrinsic contribution to the linewidth. \u2206H0 is sensitive to the film quality: the\nhighest quality films typically exhibit a smallest residual or zero field linewidth [14, 15].\n\nIV.\n\nRESONANCE FIELD\n\nFig. 4 presents the normalized FMR peak at 13 GHz for a selection of ||Pt|Cu|t Co\n|Cu|Pt|| films. The absorption lines were normalized by substracting the background signal\nand dividing by the relative change in transmission at resonance. The lineshape of the\nFMR curves is typically Lorentzian. Note that we observed asymmetric lineshapes at some\nfrequencies, associated with the measurement method. Distortion of the FMR lineshapes\noriginates from the mixing of the absorptive and dispersive components of the susceptibility\n(see Ref. [16]). Fig. 5 shows the thickness dependence of the resonance field Hres at 14 GHz\nfor films with and without 1.5 nm Pt. The resonance field is practically constant (Hres \u2248 1.2\nkOe) when the Co layer thickness is larger than 5 nm. For thinner layers, Hres increases with\ndecreasing t, reaching a value of 1.6 kOe for the film with 1 nm Co layer.

Films with equal Co layer thickness have\nnearly the same g and 4\u03c0Meff . This suggests that the Pt underlayer and capping layer do\nnot affect the magnetic properties of the films. The effective field exhibits a clear thickness\ndependence, decreasing from about 15 kOe to about 8 kOe when the Co thickness varies from\n10 nm to 1 nm (Fig. 7). The thickness dependence of the effective field can be understood\nas originating from the presence of an uniaxial anisotropy field that depends on thickness as\n1/t. The magnetization density is assumed to be independent of the film thickness, as Co\nand Cu are immiscible. The best fit to Eq. 3 gives a saturation magnetization density of\nMs = 1131 emu/cm3 and an uniaxial anisotropy constant Ks = \u22120.46 erg/cm2 . The value\nof Ms is smaller than the magnetization density of bulk fcc Co (Ms =1400 emu/cm3 ). The\nnegative sign of Ks reflects a perpendicular component of magnetic anisotropy. As noted\nearlier, the origin of this perpendicular anisotropy may be a magnetic anisotropy associated with Co|Cu interfaces or magnetoelastic interactions associated with strain in the Co\nlayers, which increases with decreasing Co thickness. The results are in good agreement\nwith magnetometry studies of 150 nm thick epitaxial Co|Cu multilayers grown on GaAs\nsubstrates, with Co layer thickness ranging from 0.5 to 4 nm [17]. The authors found an\naverage magnetization density Ms =1241 emu/cm3 and an anisotropy constant Ks = \u22120.47\nerg/cm2 . The weighted average value of the Land\u00e9 g-factor is g =2.49\u00b10.14 (inset of Fig.\n7). This is larger than the value reported in the literature for fcc phase Co (g=2.15) [18].\nNote that in thin layers there is a larger uncertainty in g making it difficult to determine\n\n9\n\n\fg-factor\n\n2.8\n\n2.4\n\n10\n\n4\n\nM\n\neff\n\n(kG)\n\n15\n\n2.0\n5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n||Cu|Co|Cu||\n\n10\n\nt (nm)\n\n||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu||\n\n0\n0.0\n\n||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|Pt||\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nt\n\n-1\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n-1\n\n(nm )\n\nFIG. 7: The effective demagnetization field 4\u03c0Meff vs. 1/t.

As mentioned earlier (section IV), we observed asymmetry in the FMR lineshape at some frequencies. In those cases, the half power linewidth was extracted using the procedure described\nin Ref. [16]. The linewidth at 10 and 14 GHz is plotted versus the thickness in Fig. 8\nfor the films with and without Pt. For thick films (t \u2265 5 nm) with two Pt outer layers,\n\u2206H is practically independent of thickness. However, the linewidth of thinner films (t < 5\nnm) increases strongly with decreasing Co layer thickness. The three series of films show\ndifferent increases of the linewidth for thin layers. For instance, the film with 2 nm Co layer\nthickness and no Pt has a linewidth of 120 Oe at 10 GHz. This is smaller than that of the\nfilm with a Pt underlayer (\u2206H=180 Oe), and that with two Pt layers (\u2206H=260 Oe). The\nfrequency dependence of \u2206H enables a determination of the Gilbert damping and the inhomogeneous contribution to the linewidth. Fig. 9 shows the frequency dependence of \u2206H\nfor a symmetric film with Pt layers (y1 = y2 = 1.5 nm) and a 3 nm thick layer of Co. The\nlinewidth depends linearly on frequency, with a zero frequency offset. Below 10 GHz, the\ndata points are more scattered. In this frequency range, the resonance field is of the order\nof or smaller than the film saturation field, and the absorption line becomes asymmetric.

The thickness dependence of the slope d\u2206H/df\nand intercept \u2206H0 are shown in Fig. 10. The two parameters exhibit similar thickness\ndependence: decreasing with increasing Co layer thickness. Therefore, both changes in the\nGilbert damping and inhomogeneous broadening contribute to the enhanced linewidth for\nthin layers. \u2206H0 approaches zero for thick Co reflecting the good quality of these layers.\nThe slope is also practically constant when t \u2265 5 nm, and it is about three times larger for\nthe thinnest films with two Pt layers.\n\n11\n\n\fH\n\n0\n\n(Oe)\n\n||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|Pt||\n||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu||\n\n200\n\n||Cu|Co|Cu||\n\n100\n\n-1\n(Oe.GHz\n\nd\n\nH / df\n\n)\n\n0\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n5\nt\n\n10\n\n(nm)\n\nFIG. 10: Thickness dependence of the two contributions to the linewidth: \u2206H0 and d\u2206H/df\n\nThe Gilbert damping G was estimated from d\u2206H/df (Fig. 10) with Eq. 4. The thickness\ndependence of the damping is shown in Fig. 11 for the films with and without Pt layers. The\ndamping of ||Cu|Co|Cu|| films is practically independent of the thickness, and it is about\nequal to the damping of the films with two Pt layers and thick Co layers (t > 5 nm). Note,\nhowever, that the inhomogeneous contribution to the linewidth increases with decreasing Co\nthickness (Fig. 10). The films with one or two Pt layers show an increase in the damping\nwhen the Co layer is thinner than 4 nm. 1.5 nm thick Pt layers are thus sufficient to lead\nto the enhancement of the damping.\nIn order to investigate whether the damping is a function of the Pt outer layers, films\nwith 2 nm thick Co layers and variable Pt layer thickness were studied. The film structure\nwas ||y Pt|Cu|2 nm Co|Cu|y Pt||. The results are shown in the inset of Fig. 11. The films\nwithout Pt have two times smaller damping than the films with Pt. However, remarkably,\nthe damping does not increase further as the Pt layer thickness is increased beyond 1.5 nm.\nIt saturates at a value of about 6 \u00d7 108 s\u22121 . This result clearly shows that the main origin\nof the enhancement of the damping in thin Co layers are the Cu|Pt interfaces. Note that\nthe films of this series, including the ones with y = 0 and y = 1.5 nm were fabricated a few\nmonths after the other series of films. It can be seen that the Gilbert damping of the samples\nwith y = 0 and y = 1.5 nm, plotted in the inset, are consistent with the films deposited\nearlier (shown in the main part of Fig. 11).\n12\n\n\f||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|Pt||\n\n)\n(x10\n\n8\n\n(x10\nG\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n8\n\ns\n\n-1\n\n||Cu|Co|Cu||\n\n3\n\nG\n\n10\n\ns\n\n-1\n\n)\n\n||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu||\n\n0\n\n||y Pt|Cu|2 Co|Cu|y Pt||\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\ny (nm)\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\nt (nm)\n\nFIG. 11: The magnetic damping versus ferromagnetic layer thickness.

In the present study, particularly from the effect of \"remote\" Pt\nlayers on the linewidth, it is clear that non-local interactions are important. We discuss this\nin detail below and follow this with a brief discussion of two-magnon scattering, which has\nbeen extensively discussed in the context of damping in ultra-thin films.\nThe dependence of G on the thickness of the FM and on the presence of the Pt can be\nunderstood in term of spin pumping induced enhancement of the magnetic damping. In this\nmodel, the precessing magnetization of the thin Co layer generates a spin current that flows\nthrough the Cu layers. In absence of Pt (||Cu|Co|Cu|| system), there is not a significant\nadditional damping with decreasing Co layer thickness because the Cu layers are 10 nm\nthick, which is much thinner than the spin diffusion length in Cu (\u03bbsd \u2248 350 nm at room\ntemperature [22]). When the Cu layer is adjacent to Pt, a strong spin scatterer, the spin\ncurrent is absorbed in Pt. There is no back flow of spin current. As a consequence, the\nGilbert damping of the FM is enhanced. For a symmetric film with two Pt layers, the effect\nis more pronounced because the pumping current is absorbed at the two interfaces with Pt.\nFurthermore, above 1.5 nm Pt, the Gilbert damping does not depend on the thickness of\n13\n\n\fPt. In assuming that the film is continuous, a Pt layer as thin as 1.5 nm is thus sufficient to\nact as a perfect spin sink, i.e., the entire spin current is absorbed. This is in agreement with\nthe results in Ref. [21], where it was reported that the spin loss parameter at the Pt|Cu\ninterface is 0.9 \u00b10.1, which implies about 70% spin randomization at the interface. For\nvery thin Co layers (t \u2264 4 nm), the non-local damping becomes predominant. It must be\nmentioned that for the films without Pt capping layer, the top Cu layer, which is in contact\nwith air, might be covered by a native oxide layer. The FMR measurements were conducted\nwithin a few days of fabrication of the films. While a priori the native oxide layer may\naffect the damping, our results indicate that this oxide layer must not play a very important\nrole. Indeed, assuming that the oxide layer acts as a spin scatterer, like Pt, it would then\nbe expected that the damping d\u2206H/df of ||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|| and ||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|Pt|| with the\nsame Co layer thickness will be equal. Fig. 10 shows that this is not the case.\nIn a symmetric structure ||NM2 |NM1 |FM|NM1 |NM2 ||, where NM2 is a perfect spin sink\nand NM1 thickness is much smaller than the spin diffusion length of the material, the Gilbert\ndamping is [3]:\n\u0010 g\u03bc \u00112 G\u0303\u2191\u2193 S \u22121\nB\neff\n.\nG(t) = G0 +\ne\nt\n\n(5)\n\nG0 is the residual Gilbert damping (bulk damping), S is the surface area of the sample and\n\u2191\u2193\n\n\u2191\u2193\n\nG\u0303eff is the effective spin mixing conductance. G\u0303eff accounts for the spin mixing conductance\nat the Co|Cu and Cu|Pt interfaces:\n1\n\u2191\u2193\nG\u0303eff S \u22121\n\n=\n\n1\n\u2191\u2193\nG\u0303Co|Cu S \u22121\n\n+\n\n1\n1\n+\n,\nGCu G\u0303Cu|Pt S \u22121\n\n(6)\n\nwhere GCu = 1/(2L\u03c1) is the conductance per spin of the Cu layer of thickness L and\nresistivity \u03c1. Using the literature value of the resistivity for pure Cu, \u03c1 = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u03a9m,\nthe conductance per spin of 10 nm Cu layer is GCu = 2.94 \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122 . In the films\n||Pt|Cu|Co|Cu|Pt|| studied here, the Cu thickness (10 nm) is much smaller than the Cu\nspin diffusion length. In addition, we found that a 1.5 nm Pt layer is sufficient to saturate\nthe additional Gilbert damping, and therefore is a perfect spin sink. The best fit of the\n\u2191\u2193\n\nthickness dependence of the magnetic damping gives G\u0303eff S \u22121 = (0.34 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122\nand G0 = 2.09 \u00b1 0.44 s\u22121 , using the average value of the g-factor reported in section IV.\nNote that the conductance per spin of a 10 nm Cu layer is about 10 times larger than\nthe estimated effective spin mixing resistance, meaning that the main contributions to the\n14\n\n\fresistance in the layered structures originates from that associated with the spin mixing at\nthe Cu|Co and at the Cu|Pt interfaces. After correction of the Sharvin conductance [3],\n\u22121\nthe effective spin mixing conductance is G\u2191\u2193\n= 0.26 \u00b1 0.04 \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122 . Using the\neff S\n\ntheoretical values of the mixing conductance for Cu|Co (0.55 \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122 ) and Cu|Pt\n(1.36 \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122 ) given in [3] and the conductance per spin of Cu as calculated above,\nthe effective spin mixing conductance of the films is predicted to be 0.34 \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122 .\nThe experimental value of the effective spin mixing is about 30% smaller than the calculated\nvalue. A similar FMR study was conducted on sputtered films with the same structure. An\n\u22121\neffective spin mixing conductance G\u2191\u2193\n= 0.41 \u00b1 0.05 \u00d7 1015 \u03a9\u22121 m\u22122 was found. The\neff S\n\nresult implies that the interface spin mixing conductance depends on the film deposition\nmethod.\nWe now briefly discuss FMR line broadening due to two magnon scattering. The scattering of magnons by defects and imperfections at the surface and interface of a thin ferromagnetic film produces modes that are degenerate with the FMR mode (k=0) [23], leading to\nan additional contribution to the linewidth. The mechanism is operative when the magnetization vector lies in the film plane, and it is not operative in the perpendicular geometry.\nRecently, Arias and Mills developed a theory of the two-magnon scattering contribution to\nthe FMR linewidth in ultra-thin films [24]. The theory was found to successfully explain\nthe frequency dependence of the linewidth of epitaxially grown thin films, with defects of\nrectangular shape [25, 26]. The AFM images (Fig. 2) show that there is no evidence of\nanisotropy in the topology of the defects at the surface of the polycrystalline films. In this\n2\ncase, according to [24], the two-magnon contribution is proportional to Hres\nand Hs2 . As\n\nshown in Fig. 9, the linewidth increases linearly with the frequency in the range 4-25 GHz.\nIn plotting the data as \u2206H versus Hres , the trend is similar to a square root dependence,\n2\nwhich does not agree with the expected Hres\ndependence predicted by [24]. Furthermore, the\n\nauthors calculated that one of the signatures of the linewidth broadening from two-magnon\nscattering is \u2206H \u221d Hs2 , where the coefficient of proportionality contains information related\nto the roughness of the film. As the uniaxial anisotropy Hs scales as 1/t (Eq. 3), it is\npredicted that the linewidth increases as 1/t2 for the very thin films. The insets of Fig. 8a\nand 8b shows the linewidth versus the Co layer thickness in log-log plot at two frequencies,\nf = 10 and f = 14 GHz respectively. From the linear best fit, we found that \u2206H increases\nas 1/tn with n \u2248 0.8. We can conclude that the Arias and Mills model of two-magnon\n15\n\n\fscattering contribution to the linewidth cannot be used to explain the thickness dependence\nof \u2206H. While, in general a two-magnon contribution to the linewidth may be present, it\ncannot explain the strong increase of the linewidth for very thin films. This can be seen by\ncomparing the films with two Pt layers and those with only the Pt underlayer. The films\ngrown with a Pt underlayer (y1 = 1.5 nm) and with or without top Pt (y2 = 1.5, 0 nm) are\nexpected to have similar microstructure, since the underlayer structure is identical (||1.5 nm\nPt|10 nm Cu). As a consequence, in the picture of two-magnon scattering induces linewidth\nbroadening, the linewidth of those films should be the same. However, the thickness dependence of \u2206H shows that the films with two Pt layers have a larger linewidth than those\nwith a single Pt layer.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have conducted a FMR study of polycrystalline ultrathin Co films embedded between\n10 nm Cu. The outer interfaces of Cu were placed in contact with different environments, by\nadding Pt layers. We have found that very thin Co layers magnetization relaxation processes\ndepend on the non-local environment. The Co layers exhibit a lower magnetization density\ncompared to the bulk material, and an uniaxial anisotropy field perpendicular to the film\nplane. The large difference between the g-factor value of the ultra-thin Co layer compared\nto the bulk fcc Co remains an open question.\nThe FMR linewidth, studied as a function of the Co layer thickness and of the nonlocal environment, increases with decreasing Co layer thickness. We have provided evidence\nthat the two-magnon scattering mechanism cannot explain the thickness dependence of\nthe linewidth. The inhomogeneous contribution to \u25b3H increases with decreasing Co layer\nthickness, independently of the presence of the Pt layer. However, the Gilbert damping, the\nintrinsic contribution to the linewidth, was found to be function of the Co layer thickness\nand depends on the non-local environment. In particular, the Gilbert damping increases\nsignificantly with decreasing Co layer thickness only in the presence of a Pt|Cu interface.\nThe thickness dependence of G is consistent with the theory of spin pumping. By changing\nthe outer interface environment of |Cu|Co|Cu| by adding or removing Pt in contact with Cu,\nwe gave unambiguous experimental evidence that the damping enhancement is a non-local\nmechanism. The non-local damping becomes predominant compared with other relaxation\n16\n\n\fmechanism when the Co layer is a few nanometer thick (t \u22644 nm).\nIn summary, the adjacent layers material as well as the non-local environment are critical\nfor understanding the magnetization relaxation in ultra-thin FMs. This important result\nmust be taking into account in the study of spin transfer devices.\nWe appreciate very stimulating discussions with C. E. Patton and J. Z. Sun. This research\nis supported by NSF-DMR-0405620 and by ONR N0014-02-1-0995.\n\n[1] R. H. Silsbee, A. Janossy, and P. Monod, Phys. Rev. B 19, 4382 (1979).\n[2] Y.
