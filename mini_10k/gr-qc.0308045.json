Introduction\nOne of the gravitational wave (GW) sources targeted by the current generation of\nground-based interferometric and resonant detectors is a stochastic background of\ngravitational waves (SBGW), produced by an unresolved superposition of signals of\nastrophysical or cosmological origin[1, 2, 3]. Direct observational limits can be set on a\nSBGW by looking for correlations in the outputs of a pair of GW detectors. This has\nbeen done using two resonant-bar detectors [4], two \"prototype\" interferometers [5],\nand is currently being done with the two kilometer-scale LIGO interferometers[6, 7]\n(IFOs). In this paper we describe the first known effort to set a limit on a SBGW with\ncorrelations between an IFO and a bar. This pair of detectors\u2013the LIGO Livingston\nObservatory (LLO)[8] in Livingston, LA and the ALLEGRO resonant bar detector[9]\nin Baton Rouge, LA\u2013is separated by only 40 km, the closest pair among the ten modern\nground-based GW detector sites. [10] This makes it an attractive pair for probing the\nstochastic GW spectrum around 900 Hz. In addition, the ALLEGRO bar can be\nrotated, changing the response of the correlated data streams to stochastic GWs and\nthus providing a means to distinguish correlations due to a SBGW from those due to\ncorrelated environmental noise.\nIn Sec. 2 we review the standard measure of stochastic background strength and\nthe cross-correlation technique used to search for a SBGW. In Sec. 3 we describe\nthe previous limits set on a SBGW with ground-based GW detectors. In Sec. 4 we\ndescribe the key features of the LLO-ALLEGRO correlation experiment in general.\nSection 5 describes the data taken during LIGO's E7 engineering run and the analysis\ncurrently underway using those data. Finally, Sec. 6 describes the prospects for future\ncorrelation experiments using ALLEGRO and LIGO science data.\n2. Stochastic Background Measurements\nA SBGW is assumed for simplicity to be isotropic, unpolarized, Gaussian, and\nstationary. Subject to these assumptions, the stochastic GW background is completely\ndescribed by its power spectrum. It is conventional to express this spectrum in terms\nof the GW contribution to the cosmological parameter \u03a9 = \u03c1/\u03c1crit :\n\u03a9GW (f ) =\n\n1 d\u03c1GW\nf d\u03c1GW\n=\n.\n\u03c1crit d ln f\n\u03c1crit df\n\n(1)\n\nNote that \u03a9GW (f ) has been constructed to be dimensionless, and represents the\ncontribution to the overall \u03a9GW per logarithmic frequency interval. In particular,\nit is not equivalent to d\u03a9GW /df . Note also that since the critical density \u03c1crit , which\nis used in the normalization of \u03a9GW (f ), is proportional to the square of the Hubble\nconstant H0 [11], it is convenient to work with h2100 \u03a9GW (f ), which is independent of\nH0\nthe observationally determined value of h100 = 100 km/\ns/ Mpc .\nThe standard method to search for such a background is to cross-correlate the\noutputs of two gravitational wave detectors [1]. If the noise in the two detectors\nis uncorrelated, the only non-zero contribution to the average cross-correlation will\ncome from the stochastic GW background. In the optimally-filtered cross-correlation\nmethod (described in more detail in [2, 12, 13]), one calculates a cross-correlation\nstatistic\nZ\nZ\ne )e\nY = dt1 dt2 h1 (t1 ) Q(t1 \u2212 t2 )h2 (t2 ) = df e\nh\u22171 (f ) Q(f\nh2 (f )\n(2)\n\n\fStochastic Background Search with ALLEGRO and LIGO\n\n3\n\nwhere h1,2 (t) are the data streams from the two detectors, e\nh1,2 (f ) are their Fourier\ne )) is a suitably-chosen optimal\ntransforms, and Q(t1 \u2212 t2 ) (with Fourier transform Q(f\nfilter. It is sensitive[12] to backgrounds on the order of\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\u0012 Z\n2\n\u03b312\n(f )\nUL\n.\n(3)\n\u03a9 \u223c T df 6\nf P1 (f )P2 (f )\nThis sensitivity improves with time and is limited by the power spectral densities\nP1,2 (f ) of the noise in the two detectors. The factor\nZ\n5\nab\n\u03b312 (f ) = d1ab dcd\nd2 \u03a9\u0302 ei2\u03c0f \u03a9\u0302*\u2206~x/c Pcd\n(\u03a9\u0302)\n(4)\n2\n4\u03c0 S 2\nin the numerator of the integral is the overlap reduction function [14], which describes\nab\nthe observing geometry. Here Pcd\n(\u03a9\u0302) is a projector onto symmetric traceless tensors\ntransverse to a direction \u03a9\u0302 and dab\n1,2 are the detector response tensors for the two\ndetectors. These are the tensors with which the metric perturbation hab at the detector\nshould be contracted to obtain the gravitational wave strain h = dab hab . If ua and va\nare unit vectors pointing in the directions of an IFO's two arms, its response tensor is\n1\n(5)\ndab = (ua ub \u2212 va vb )\n2\nwhile the response tensor for a resonant bar whose long axis is parallel to the unit\nvector wa is\ndab = wa wb .\n\n(6)\n\nThe overlap reduction function is equal to unity for the case of a pair of IFOs (or\nan IFO and a bar) at the same location with their arms aligned, and is suppressed\nas the detectors are rotated out of alignment or separated from one another. The\nfrequency dependence comes about for the following reason: if the wavelength is\ncomparable to or smaller than the separation between two detectors, the detectors\nwill see different phases of the wave at the same time, and this phase difference\nwill depend on the direction of propagation of the wave. Since the stochastic GW\nbackground is assumed to be isotropic, averaging over different propagation directions\nsuppresses the sensitivity of a pair of detectors to high-frequency waves. For example,\na wave whose wavelength is twice the distance between the two detectors will drive\nthem 180\u25e6 out of phase if it travels along the line separating them, but in phase if\nits direction of propagation is perpendicular to this line. Figure 1 shows the overlap\nreduction functions for several detector pairs of interest.\n3. Previous Results\nThe current best upper limit on a SBGW from direct observation with GW detectors is\nh2100 \u03a9GW (900 Hz) \u2264 60 [4], set by correlating the resonant bar detectors Explorer[15]\n(in Geneva, Switzerland) and Nautilus[16] (near Rome, Italy).\u2021 A broad-band limit\nof h2100 \u03a9GW (f ) \u2264 3 \u00d7 105 was set using a pair of \"prototype interferometers\" [5], and\nmore recently an analysis of E7 engineering data from the LLO and LHO sites [6] set\na limit of h2100 \u03a9GW (40\u2013215 Hz) \u2264 7.7 \u00d7 104 . Analysis [7] of LLO and LHO data from\nLIGO's first science run (S1) is expected to improve substantially upon this limit.\n\u2021 The same group had previously[17] set a limit of h2100 \u03a9GW (900 Hz) \u2264 100 using a single bar\ndetector.\n\n\f4\n\nStochastic Background Search with ALLEGRO and LIGO\n\nOverlap Reduction Function\n1\no\n\n0.5\n\nLLO-ALLEGRO (N18 W)\no\nLLO-ALLEGRO (N48 W)\no\nLLO-ALLEGRO (N63 W)\no\nLLO-ALLEGRO (N108 W)\nLLO-LHO\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nFigure 1.

The four\nLLO-ALLEGRO curves correspond to four orientations: \"N18\u25e6 W\" is nearly\nparallel to the y-arm of LLO (\"anti-aligned\"); \"N108\u25e6 W\" is nearly parallel\nto the x-arm of LLO (\"aligned\"); \"N63\u25e6 W\" is halfway in between these two\norientations (a \"null alignment\" midway between the two LLO arms); \"N48\u25e6 W\"\nis an intermediate alignment in which ALLEGRO was also operated during the\nE7 run.\n\nMore stringent upper limits can be set on astrophysical grounds. They are\ndetailed elsewhere [2, 3, 7], but we mention the bound from big-bang nucleosynthesis[11, 3], which states that a cosmological SBGW is limited by\nZ \u221e\ndf 2\nh100 \u03a9GW (f ) \u2264 10\u22125 .\n(7)\n10\u22128 Hz f\nThis broad-band limit tells us that any cosmologically interesting SBGW almost\ncertainly lies several orders of magnitude below the existing limits.\n4. ALLEGRO-LLO Correlations\nDue to the 3000 km distance between the two LIGO detectors, the overlap reduction\nfunction (see Fig. 1) limits the range of frequencies at which they are sensitive to\na stochastic background. The separation distance is half of a GW wavelength at a\nfrequency of 50 Hz, so the upper end of the frequency range is a few times this. (The\nlower end of the frequency range is set by the seismic noise in the two detectors.)\nThe ALLEGRO bar detector is far closer to the LIGO Livingston site than the LIGO\nHanford site is, with only about 40 km separating the two and a \"half-wavelength\"\n\n\fStochastic Background Search with ALLEGRO and LIGO\n\n5\n\nfrequency of 3750 Hz. Thus the observing geometry for ALLEGRO-LLO allows for\nobservations of correlations out to much higher frequencies. On the other hand, the\nsensitivity of ALLEGRO (see Fig. 2) is concentrated in two narrow frequency bands\nin the vicinity of 900 Hz, so correlations between ALLEGRO and LIGO Livingston\nprobe a different part of the frequency domain than correlations between the two\nLIGO detectors. The major challenge in detecting a SBGW is accounting for the\neffects of noise which may be correlated between the two detectors. Even in widely\nseparated detectors such as LLO and LHO there may exist correlations (the most\nobvious example being the due to the power line frequency and its harmonics) which\ncould mimic or mask a real SBGW. With detectors in much closer proximity, such\nas ALLEGRO and LLO, the problem could potentially be more severe. A method\nproposed by Lazzarini and Finn [18] is to rotate the ALLEGRO bar about a vertical\naxis and measure the cross-correlation for different alignments of the ALLEGRO-LLO\npair. Changing the alignment of the bar from one of the interferometer arms to the\nother changes the sign of the expected correlation due to a SBGW. Thus any correlated\nnoise which is independent of alignment can be removed. Another possibility is to\nrecord data with the bar aligned at 45\u25e6 from the arms where no correlation due to a\nSBGW is expected. This \"off source\" measurement gives an uncontaminated estimate\nof the cross-correlated noise.\n4.1. LLO-ALLEGRO Co\u0131\u0308ncidence Operation\nThe ALLEGRO detector took data during LIGO \"E7\" Engineering Run that took\nplace from December 2001 to January 2002. In the following section we discuss\nthe initial investigations underway. Following the the E7 run ALLEGRO went offline for a major upgrade. Beginning in the summer of 2002 a new transducer [19]\nwas installed which should substantially improve the sensitive bandwidth of the bar\ndetector. Figure 2 shows the projected improvement in bandwidth and sensitivity.\nThe installation was ongoing during the time of the LIGO S1 science run in AugustSeptember 2002. Following the installation, a series of cool-down attempts were made.\nA succession of repairs were done on the vacuum system and a successful cool-down\nwas finally made starting in February 2003. This allowed data to be taken with\nALLEGRO during approximately the second half of the LIGO S2 run.\n5. Investigations with LIGO Engineering Data\nFrom December 28, 2001 to January 14, 2002, LIGO held its seventh Engineering Run\n(E7), the last engineering run before the start of scientific operation in August 2002.\nThe ALLEGRO detector was in operation for the end of that run. Table 1 summarizes\nthe ALLEGRO data which overlap with science-quality LLO data.\nIf no excess correlations are found, and we assume that all of the ALLEGRO data\nhave a level of noise given by the solid curve in Fig. 2, and all of the LLO data are\nof a quality described by [21], (3) tells us to expect to set an upper limit of around\n1.2 \u00d7 104 .\u00a7\nAnalysis of the data described in Table 1 is currently in progress. In the remainder\nof this section, we outline some of the technical challenges involved in this analysis.\n\u00a7 This would actually be better than the limit of 7.7 \u00d7 104 set in [6], which is understandable because\nit involves only one engineering-quality LIGO data stream, while the LLO-LHO analysis involves two.\nThe sensitivity of at both LIGO sites improved markedly between E7 and the science runs.

Summary of ALLEGRO data co\u0131\u0308ncident with LLO operation during\nE7. The table lists ALLEGRO's alignment in degrees West of North, the resulting\nvalue of the overlap reduction function \u03b3(f ) (see Fig. 1) in ALLEGRO's sensitivity\nband, and the number of 15-minute segments of clean LLO data which co\u0131\u0308ncide\nwith ALLEGRO data in each alignment.\n\nFirst, the nature of the data recorded is different: LIGO data consists of a real\ntime series hL (t), sampled at 16384 Hz, which is related by a linear transfer function\nto the gravitational wave strain in the detector. The Fourier transform h\u0303L (f ) of this\ndata stream contains frequencies from \u22128912 Hz to 8912 Hz, although the negative\nfrequency components are all determined by the positive frequency ones. Because the\nALLEGRO detector's sensitivity is confined to a band with \u2206f < f , its data stream\nhA (t) is heterodyned (mixed with an oscillating signal at frequency fH = 907 Hz)\nand low-pass filtered (before it is digitized) and then sampled at the reduced rate\ni2\u03c0(\u2212fH t+\u03c6A )\nof 250 Hz. The result is to produce a complex signal hH\nhA (t)\nA (t) = e\ni2\u03c0\u03c6A\ncontains\ncompletely\nindependent\nwhose Fourier transform h\u0303H\n(f\n)\n\u2248\nh\u0303\n(f\n+\nf\n)e\nA H\nA\ndata at frequencies \u2212125 Hz < f < 125 Hz, which are approximations of the\nFourier transforms of the data in the original time series between (907 \u2212 125) Hz\n\n\fStochastic Background Search with ALLEGRO and LIGO\n\n7\n\nand (907 + 125) Hz.\nThe initial approach we are taking to correlating these data streams with different\nsampling frequencies is to heterodyne and resample the LIGO data in software\ni2\u03c0(\u2212fH t+\u03c6L )\n(producing an hH\nhL (t) whose Fourier transform is h\u0303H\nL (t) = e\nL (f ) \u2248\ni2\u03c0\u03c6L\n) and then correlate it with the ALLEGRO data as though they\nh\u0303L (fH + f )e\nwere any two heterodyned data streams. This requires a certain amount of care,\nbecause the phase \u03c6L at the start of a stretch of data of the reference oscillator for the\nLIGO heterodyning is specified (because it's done in software), while the phase \u03c6A of\nthe ALLEGRO reference oscillator is only known if it is experimentally determined. In\nprinciple, it is not difficult to keep track of this, but it is also possible to post-process\nthe cross-correlation statistics to account for ignorance of the phase difference \u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6L\nbetween the two oscillators.[23]\nAdditional technical challenges include converting ALLEGRO data into the frame\nformat used by LIGO[24] so that it can be processed by the LIGO Data Analysis\nSystem[25]. Fortunately, the LIGO stochastic search codes[13, 26, 27] have been\ndesigned with an eye to working on both heterodyned and non-heterodyned data,\nand the data structures describing site geometryk allow for either interferometric or\nresonant bar detector geometries.\n6. Future Outlook\nThe upper limit we expect to set from E7 data is several orders of magnitude above the\ncurrent direct observational limit[4] at the frequencies in question. But the practical\napplication of the LLO-ALLEGRO cross-correlation method to engineering data will\npave the way for future such observations, whose sensitivity is expected to improve\nfor several reasons:\n(i) Most substantially, the sensitivity of the LLO IFO has already improved\nmarkedly[22] and will continue to improve as the instrument approaches its design\nsensitivity[21].\n(ii) ALLEGRO's new transducer will increase the bandwidth of the bar detector (see\nthe dashed curve in Fig. 2).\n(iii) Future observing runs will provide more co\u0131\u0308ncident data than the 80 hours or so\ntaken during E7.\nAssuming a full year of co\u0131\u0308ncident data in optimal alignment, with LLO operating\nat design sensitivity and ALLEGRO operating at the sensitivity given by the dashed\ncurve in Fig. 2, we estimate using (3) that an upper limit could be set in the range\n890 < f < 930 of h2100 \u03a9GW (f ) . 10\u22122 .\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank everyone at the LIGO and ALLEGRO projects and especially\nthe LSC's stochastic sources upper limits group.
