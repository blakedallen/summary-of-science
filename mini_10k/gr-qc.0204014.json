Introduction\nRecently Damour and Nordtvedt [1] has been demonstrated quite generally that scalar tensor (ST) theories generically contain a natural attractor mechanism toward general relativity\n(GR). Such a possibility was also suggested previously [2,3] but only for some particular classes\nof models. This means ST theories are cosmologically evolved toward a state with no scalar\nadmixture to gravity during matter dominated era [1] or even during radiation era [3,4,5].\nThis attractor feature is important because it diminishes the doubt on the existence of massless scalar field with gravitational-strength coupling by providing reasonable explanation for\nthe small effect of the scalar fields (in comparison with curvature effect) in the present epoch\nwithout requiring any fine-tuned large value of the coupling parameter as needed in the case\nof celebrated Brans-Dicke (BD) theory [6]. It is worth mentioning that a scalar partner to\n\u2217\n\nEmail address: aru bhadra@yahoo.com\n\n1\n\n\fgravity is inevitable in most efforts at unifying gravity with the other interactions, such as superstring theories [7] or Kaluza-Klien theories [8]. In cosmology also, the scalar field is found\nto play an appreciable role by providing a natural way to overcome the fine tuning problem of\n\"new\" inflationary model of universe by terminating the inflationary era through nucleation of\nbubbles [9]. The present acceleration of the universe, as revealed from the observational data\nof the type 1a supernova [10], also can be accommodate with the scalar field coupled gravity\ntheories without the need of any new kind of matter field (so called \"Quintessence matter\")\nhaving a positive energy density but a negative pressure [11,12].\nThe attractor mechanism is based on the idea that a ST theory converges to GR for certain\nvalues of the characteristic coupling parameter \u03c9(\u03c6), which represents the strength of the coupling between the scalar field and the curvature. During cosmological evolution, the Einstein\nframe coupling parameter \u03b1(\u03c6\u0303) tends to zero [1] or equivalently in Jordan frame \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e\n\n(\u03b12 (\u03c6\u0303) \u2261\n\n1\n)\n3+2\u03c9(\u03c6)\n\nand this limit is usually regarded as GR limit of ST theories. However,\n\nrecently it has been shown that the BD theory, which is the simplest ST theory with constant\n\n\u03c9, does not necessarily reduce to GR in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e when the trace of the matter energy-\n\nmomentum tensor vanishes [13-16]. It is, therefore, important to examine the \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e limit\nof ST theories.\n\nIn the present work, we investigate \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e limit of ST theories in the radiation (and\nvacuum) universe. We shall rigorously show that the limit \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e does not reduce a ST\n\ntheory to GR. The cosmological evolution of the scale factor a(t) during radiation era will also\nbe analyzed, in presence of a scalar field satisfying the modified (explain below) Nordtvedt\nconditions [17].\nThe paper is organized as follows: the general field equations of ST theories are set up in the\nnext section. The non-convergence of ST theories to GR is discussed in sec. III. An exact\nsolution of scale factor a(t) in radiation universe is obtained in sec. IV for general ST theories\nunder modified Nordtvedt conditions, and the results are discussed in sec. V.\n\nII. Field equations\nHere we consider the most general ST theories of gravity with a single scalar field. In the\nJordan conformal frame (since experimentally observed quantities are those written in the\n\n2\n\n\fJordan frame, we shall work in this frame throughout the paper), the general form of the\naction describing a massless scalar-tensor theory of gravity in natural units (G = c = 1) is\n[17,18]\n1\nA=\n16\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\"\n\n\u03c9(\u03c6) \u03bc\u03bd\ng \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + 16\u03c0Lm\n\u2212gd x \u03c6R \u2212\n\u03c6\n4\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nwhere R is the Ricci scalar constructed from the metric g\u03bc\u03bd , and Lm is the Lagrangian density\n\nof ordinary matter which could include electromagnetic field, nuclear field etc. The principle\nof equivalence is guaranteed by requiring that the matter field Lagrangian can depend only on\nthe metric g\u03bc\u03bd but not on \u03c6. A variation of (1) with respect to g \u03bc\u03bd and \u03c6 yields, respectively,\nthe field equations\nR\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1\n8\u03c0\n\u03c9\n1\n1\n\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R =\nT\u03bc\u03bd + 2 \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6,\u03c3 \u03c6,\u03c3 + (\u03c6,\u03bc;\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737\u03c6) ,\n2\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n2\n\u03c6\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n8\u03c0\n\u03c9\u2032\n\u2737\u03c6 =\nT\u2212\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bd ;\n2\u03c9(\u03c6) + 3\n2\u03c9(\u03c6) + 3\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwith the energy momentum conservation equation\nT;\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u2737 \u2261 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd , T =T\u03bc\u03bc is the trace of the matter energy momentum tensor and \u03c9 \u2032 \u2261\n\nd\u03c9\n.\nd\u03c6\n\nIt is clear that the scalar field plays the role which in GR played by the gravitational constant,\nbut with \u03c6 now a dynamical variable.\nTo proceed further, we consider a homogenous and isotropic universe. The line element has\nthen a Robertson-Walker form:\ndr 2\nds = \u2212dt + a (t)\n+ r 2 d\u03a92 ;\n1 \u2212 kr 2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(5)\n\ncurvature constant k = \u22121, 0, +1 for an open, flat or closed universe respectively. The condition\n\nof homogeneity implies that the scalar field is only a function of the time coordinate, \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(t).\nFor the above line element, the Eq. (4) reduces to\n\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3 (\u03c1 + p) = 0\na\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere an over dot denotes d/dt. For a radiation universe with equation of state P = 13 \u03c1, the\nabove equation yields\n\u03c1=\n\n3\n\u0393a\u22124\n8\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u0393 is a positive constant. \u0393 = 0 corresponds to vacuum (\u03c1 = P = 0). The field equations\n(2) and (3) thus yield\n\u02272\n\u03c6\u0307 \u0227 \u03c9(\u03c6) \u03c6\u03072\n\u0393\nk\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n,\na2\n\u03c6a4 a2 \u03c6 a\n6 \u03c62\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c6\u0307 \u0227 \u03c6\u0308\n\u0393\n\u03c9(\u03c6) \u03c6\u03072\n\u00e4 \u02272 + k\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u22122\n\u2212 ,\n2 +\n2\n4\n2\na\na\n\u03c6a\n2 \u03c6\n\u03c6a \u03c6\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c6\u03072 \u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c6)\n3\u0227\n.\n\u03c6\u0308 + \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212\na\n3 + 2\u03c9(\u03c6)\n\n(10)\n\nand\n\nWhen \u03c6 is a constant, the above equations (8) and (9) reduce to the GR equations with a\ngravitational constant G = \u03c61 .\n\nIII. Non-convergence of ST theories to GR\nThe first integral of the equation (10) immediately gives,\n\u03c6\u0307 =\n\nA\nq\n\na3 (3 + 2\u03c9(\u03c6))\n\n(11)\n\nwhere A is a constant. The above equation is true for any radiation or vacuum cosmological\nFriedmann solution and is valid for all ST theories. It is to be noted that since A is independent\nof time, it can not be a function of \u03c9(\u03c6) but for Brans-Dicke theory (\u03c9 is constant) A may\ndepend on \u03c9. Inserting \u03c6\u0307 from Eq. (11) into Eqs. (8) and (9) we get under the limit \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e\n\u02272 + k\n\u0393\nA2\n=\n+\n,\na2\n\u03c6a4 12\u03c62a6\n\n(12)\n\n\u0393\nA2\n\u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c6)\n\u00e4 \u02272 + k\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(1\n\u2212\n).\n2 +\na\na2\n\u03c6a4 4\u03c62 a6\n\u03c9 2 (\u03c6)\n\n(13)\n\nand\n\n4\n\n\fand the Ricci scalar in the same limit is given by\n3\u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c6)\n1\n\u2212\n4\u03c9 2 (\u03c6) 2\u03c6\n\n1\nR\u2243\u2212\n\u03c6\n\n!\n\nA2\n,\na6\n\n(14)\n\nWhen a scalar-tensor theory converges to GR, the scalar curvature must approach to zero and\nat the same time, the scalar field must become a constant as well. It is evident from Eq. (11)\nthat as \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e, \u03c6 is tending to a constant value (1). A should not vanish in this limit\nsince A is independent of \u03c9(\u03c6). a(t) must be bounded for any realistic theory of gravity. Then\nit follows from Eq. (14) that R is not approaching its GR value (0) for large value of \u03c9(\u03c6)\n\u2032\n\nor even for the Nordtvedt conditions [17] viz. \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e , \u03c9\u03c93(\u03c6)\n\u2192 0. These conditions are\n(\u03c6)\n\nessential if the solar system tests are to accord with observations. In fact the first term at the\n\nright hand side of Eq. (14) is ambiguous under Nordtvedt conditions. On the other hand, the\nsecond term at the right hand side of Eq. (14) becomes non-zero constant as \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e. The\n\nsaid ambiguity in the expression of R under original Nordtvedt conditions can be avoided by\nslightly modifying the Nordtvedt conditions as\n\u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e ,\n\n\u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c6)\n\u21920\n\u03c9 2 (\u03c6)\n\n(15)\n\nBut even for such modified conditions, R remains non-zero and the field equations are clearly\ndifferent from the corresponding GR equations with the same energy momentum tensor. This\nshows that GR cannot be recovered from ST theories by imposing constraints on the coupling\nparameter \u03c9(\u03c6).\n\nIV. Radiation solution\nTo obtain solution of the simultaneous equations (12) and (13) under modified Nordtvedt\nconditions, we first write these equations in the synchronous gauge\na\u20322 + ka2 = \u0393 +\n\nA2\n12a2\n\n(16)\n\nand\nA2\n2aa \u2212 a + ka = \u2212\u0393 + 2\n4a\n\u2032\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u20322\n\n5\n\n(17)\n\n\fwhere prime denotes d/d\u03b7 and the conformal time \u03b7 is defined through\nad\u03b7 = dt\n\n(18)\n\nFor flat universe (k = 0), solution of (16) and (17) is\n\na(\u03b7) =\n\nA\n\u221a \u03b7 + \u0393\u03b7 2\n3\n\n!1/2\n\n;\n\n(19)\n\nand the cosmic time (t) is related with the conformal time (\u03b7) via\n\nt=\n\nZ\n\nad\u03b7 =\n\n\u03b7\nA\n\u221a +\n4 3\u0393 2\n\n!\n\nA\n\u221a \u03b7 + \u0393\u03b7 2\n3\n\n!1/2\n\nq\n\u221a\nA2\nA\n3\u0393\u03b7 + 2 3 \u221a + \u0393\u03b7\n\u2212\nLog\n2\n3/2\n12\u0393\n3\ns\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(20)\n\nIt is expected that all radiation solutions of ST theories with an arbitrary coupling function\nwill converge to the above solutions under modified Nordtvedt conditions. For verification, we\nconsider solutions obtained by Barrow for a class of ST theory [19] defined through 2\u03c9(\u03c6)+3 =\n2B1 (1 \u2212\n\n\u03c6 \u2212\u03b1\n) ;\n\u03c60\n\n\u03b1 > 0, B1 > 0 constants. The theory reduces to Barker's \"constant\" G theory\n\n[20] for \u03b1 = 1 and B1 = \u22121/2 and to Brans-Dicke theory [6] for \u03b1 = 0. The theory has been\nstudied extensively in [3,5,19]. The exact radiation solutions for \u03b1 = 1 is given by [19]\n\u03c6(\u03b7) =\n\n4\u03c60 K \u03bb \u03b7 \u03bb (\u03b7 + 2\u03b70 )\u03bb\n[(\u03b7 + 2\u03b70 )\u03bb + K \u03bb \u03b7 \u03bb ]2\n\n(21)\n\n\u0393\u03b7(\u03b7 + \u03b70 )\n\u03c6(\u03b7)\n\n(22)\n\na2 (\u03b7) =\n\nwhere \u03bb = (3/2B1 )1/2 , and K and \u03b70 are constants. As \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e, scalar field approaches \u03c60\n\nand the expression for scale factor (22) indeed converges to (19).\nIt is clear from Eqs. (19) and (20) that for large \u03b7, t \u2192\n\n\u221a\n\u0393 2\n\u03b7\n2\n\nand a \u221d t1/2 i.e., the solution\n\napproaches the usual radiation dominated Friedmann model of GR. But when t is not very\nlarge, the scale factor differs from that of GR.\n\nV. Conclusion\nThe evolution of scalar field suggests [3,4,5] that the coupling function \u03c9(\u03c6) may evolve to\na large value during radiation era. Some authors have discussed the effect of an inflationary\n6\n\n\fphase in pushing \u03c9(\u03c6) towards the extremum [3]. Consequently, there is a standard belief\nthat ST theories are indistinguishable from GR at late radiation epoch and during matter\ndominated era. We have shown that the limit \u03c9(\u03c6) \u2192 \u221e does not reduce a ST theory to\nGR for trace-free stress energy. But this is not surprising as the PPN parameters describe\n\nthe possible deviations from GR in the local interaction of massive bodies and the Nordtvedt\nconditions reduce ST theories to GR only in the weak field limit. It is already known that\nthe Brans-Dicke theory also does not always reduce to GR when T = 0. But in that case the\ndependence of the BD scalar field \u03c6 on the coupling constant essentially remains arbitrary [16]\nand the asymptotic behavior of \u03c6 should be fixed respecting Machian nature of the BD theory (which is the motivation for the development of the theory) which immediately suggests\n\u03c6 \u223c \u03c60 + O\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n1\n\u03c9\n\nfor large values of \u03c9(\u03c6), so that the theory reduces to GR asymptotically\n\n[16,21]. But such a constraint on the functional dependence of \u03c6 on \u03c9(\u03c6) is not allowed for\ngeneral ST theories.\nFor compatibility with post-Newtonian weak field observations, Nordtvedt conditions are usually imposed on ST theories. However, it is found that the original Nordtvedt conditions lead\nto an ambiguity in the value of Ricci scalar. As a result a slight modification of the second\nNordtvedt condition is proposed (15) so that the Ricci scalar becomes finite and at the same\ntime ST theories remain consistent with weak field observations.\nThe evolution of the scale factor during radiation era is studied for general ST cosmology\nunder modified Nordtvedt conditions. An exact solution is obtained for flat universe which\nfor certain conditions gives the corresponding GR solution. All classes (compatible with solar\nsystem observations) of ST radiation solutions should tend to this solution in the limit of large\n\u03c9(\u03c6). At late times (t \u2192 \u221e) this solution tends to GR radiation solution but at early periods\n(when t is not very large) it differs from the GR solution. The effect of such a difference on\ncosmological observations should be very interesting and will be investigated in a subsequent\nwork. But it is evident that at least on principle the presence of a Brans-Dicke scalar field\nwith an extremely large \u03c9(\u03c6) could be detected through cosmological observations.\nAcknowledgment : The author wishes to thank IUCAA Reference Centre (NBU) for providing its facilities.
