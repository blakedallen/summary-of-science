Concerning\nbandwidth and electron mass renormalization effects, a\nrather limited body of data from photoemission is available [4,5,6,7]. In a comparison of photoemission data\nwith band structure calculations [7] it was concluded\nthat correlation effects do not play a major role. Surface\nstate contributions have been sorted out more recently\n[8,9,10]. The experimental resolution in these studies\nwas rather low compared to today's standards, and many\nquestions had to remain unresolved. Therefore, high\nresolution ARPES data are needed for an identification\nof correlation effects.\nThere are substantial indications that in iron electron\ncorrelation effects are strong and pronounced. In de\nHaas- van Alphen experiments [11], drastic mass renormalization has been derived for states near the Fermi\nlevel. The quasiparticle masses here are enhanced by up\nto a factor of three. Another study concentrating on surface states has identified quasiparticle renormalization\non the spin wave energy scale by means of photoemission [12], and a characteristic spectroscopic signature in\nthe self-energy was obtained. Very recently, a highpressure phase of iron has been described which is superconducting [13]. It has been suggested that spin fluctations are responsible for the condensation of superconducting charge carriers [14].\nIn this paper, we present an extensive account of\nhigh-resolution ARPES data on the (110) face of ferromagnetic iron. Using a tunable third generation light\nsource, k-space locations have been determined with\ngreat accuracy, providing the first set of ARPES Fermi\nsurfaces of iron. The data are contrasted with DFT cal\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA comprehensive understanding of the electronic\nproperties of solids has to include interactions beyond\nthe one-electron mean-field picture. While for freeelectron-like metals predictions from a simple band\nstructure picture can be successfully obtained, the situation is much more complex for transition metals where\nthe quasi-local character of the d-electrons leads to pronounced correlation effects. One of the phenomena that\nresult from the electronic interaction is magnetic ordering in the low-temperature ground state. The description\nof ground state properties such as crystal structure and\nmagnetic moments has been improved much since density functional theory (DFT) was introduced. Many other\nmaterial properties, however, involve excited states. A\nprominent example is the determination of the electronic\nband structure with angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), where quasiparticle energies are detected.\nA model system to study electron correlations in a dband metal is ferromagnetic iron. It is a transition metal\nwith electron configuration 3d6 4s2 that assumes a bcc\ncrystal structure and exhibits a rather high Curie temperature of TC = 1043 K. It belongs to the group of 3d\nferromagnets formed by Fe, Co and Ni, all of which\ncontain s-p-like as well as d-like orbitals in the valence\nband. The d-bands are only partially filled and account\nfor the states near the Fermi level EF. In the ferromagnetically ordered state, spin-split bands with majority\nand minority spin character develop. In the series Fe, Co,\nNi with increasing d-filling, the minority band occupation is smallest in Fe. As a result, the magnetic moment\n\u03bc is highest in Fe, with a value of \u03bc ~ 2.1 [1].\nAn open question is to which extent Fe is a correlated\nmaterial. Self-energy effects arising from many-body\ninteractions can by identified in the quasiparticle band\nstructure e.g. as a reduction of the bandwidth when referenced to DFT calculations. Furthermore, a correlation\n1\n\n\fPreprint\n\nMANUSCRIPT\n\nculations. The comparison highlights the additional contribution of electron correlations to the excited quasiparticle state. Considerable reduction of the occupied bandwidth is observed at various locations of the band structure. Moreover, strong quasiparticle mass renormalization is observed close to the Fermi level. From the data, a\nk-space map with quantitative renormalization factors is\nobtained. Effects such as electron-magnon coupling and\nthe available phase space for interactions is addressed.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows:\nSection II contains details of both the ARPES experiment as well as the computational DFT procedure. In\nSection III, a detailed analysis of the Fermi surface\nsheets obtained from both theory and ARPES is given.\nSection IV focuses on the electron band dispersion along\nprincipal directions. In the discussion presented in Section V, particular attention is given to deviations between\nDFT and ARPES, and the role of electron correlation effects is discussed.\n\n21 January 2005\n\n110\n\nH\nP\n\nN\n\nP\n\nH\nP\nH\ncentral\nplane\n\nP\nH\n\n\u0393\nP\n\n001\n\nP\n\nN\nH\n\nP\nbottom\nplane\n\nP\nH\n\nFIG. 1.

Experiment\nSince the use of Fe crystals is disadvantageous due to\ntenacious impurities, Fe(110) films of very high purity\nwere grown by electron-beam evaporation onto a\nW(110) substrate at a base pressure of 7 \u00d7 10-11 mbar.\nThe deposited film thickness was monitored with a\nquartz crystal microbalance in situ. The thickness was\ntypically larger than 100 ML. Following the film growth,\nthe crystal structure of the bcc Fe film was annealed at\n500o C, and its quality confirmed by low energy electron\ndiffraction. Iron is known to grow rather defect-free on\nW(110) despite a lattice mismatch of ~ 9.4 %. The strain\nis accommodated in a regular dislocation network, which\noccurs approximately in the first five layers, beyond\nwhich the lattice constant is fully relaxed and unperturbed [15,16].\nARPES was performed at T = 25 K at beamline 7.0.1\nof the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley. The electron\nanalyzer, type Scienta SES-100, was operated at a momentum resolution of ~0.012 \u00c5\u20131 and a total energy\nresolution of ~35 meV. The photon energy used for this\nstudy was of the order of 100-140 eV, resulting in a kinetic energy of the excited electrons which is far larger\nthan the lattice potential. This justifies the assumption of\nfree electron final states and the use of an inner potential\nto obtain the perpendicular momentum k\u22a5 inside the\nsolid.\n\nvon Barth and Hedin. was performed by Callaway and\nWang in 1977 [18], and has become the \"seminal\" paper\nto which many of the following theoretical and experimental data have been compared up to now.\nHere, the electronic structure of ferromagnetic iron\nhas been calculated with a considerably more elaborate\nDFT approach employing the WIEN2k computer code\n[23]. These calculations utilize the full potential \"augmented plane wave + local orbitals\" (APW+LO) method,\ninclude scalar-relativistic effects and use the generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA) [24] to describe exchange and correlation. The GGA treatment reproduces\nsome properties better than previous LSDA calculations.\nFor bcc iron, the lattice constant obtained from energy\noptimization is too small for LSDA, while GGA yields\nalmost the experimentally observed value [25]. In addition, LSDA wrongly predicts Fe to be more stable in a\nnonmagnetic fcc structure than in the experimentally observed ferromagnetic bcc one [26]. The DFT GGA output has been used to generate both Fermi surface cross\nsections as well as electronic band dispersions along\nvarious principal directions.\nIII. FERMI SURFACES\n1. DFT Fermi Surfaces\nThe Brillouin zone (BZ) of bcc Fe is a regular decahedron where each face is diamond-shaped, see Fig. 1.\nThe corners of these faces, and hence the corners of the\nBZ, are formed by six H points and by eight P points.\nThe general features of the Fermi surface (FS) of bcc Fe\nhave been reasonably well established through the early\nLSDA calculation of Callaway and Wang [18]. The minority FS consists of an electron surface at \u0393 and six hole\n\n2. Calculation\nIn the past, many different calculational approaches\nhave been applied to obtain the band structure of ferromagnetic iron [17,18,19,20,21,22]. A density functional\ncalculation in the local spin density approximation\n(LSDA) using the spin-polarized exchange-correlation of\n2\n\n\fPreprint\n\nMANUSCRIPT\n\n21 January 2005\n\nkey features a large electron octahedron (I) at \u0393. Tubular\nhole FS sheets (II) connecting the H points are seen at\nthe left and right side of this BZ cross section. Very near\nto the H point two more bands form rather small FS\nsheets (III and IV).\nAnother FS cross section in direction perpendicular\nto the (110) face used in the experiment is provided by\nthe (001)-plane. The results of our DFT calculation are\ndisplayed in Fig. 3. In this cut, the BZ cross section is a\nsquare. The minority FS in Fig. 3(a) yields a square\ncontour for the electron surface VI centered at \u0393. In this\nview, the minute spherical FS VII are seen fourfold, in\nclose vicinity to the four large octahedra V that surround\nthe H points at the corners of the BZ boundary.\nThe majority FS in this (001)-cross section in Fig.\n3(b) shows the rather considerable extent of the majority\nelectron surface I in the center of the BZ. It almost\nmakes contact with the tubular FS sheets II that connect\nthe four H points. Again, miniscule FS sheets (III, IV) at\nthe H points can be seen, resulting from additional conduction bands. We note already here that the orbital\ncharacter of all states at the Fermi level is dominantly of\nd-character, with the only exception of the FS sheets at\nthe N point that have some p-character. This will emerge\nfrom the band structure calculations presented below in\nSection IV.\n\nsurfaces at the H points. The majority FS consists of a\nlarge electron surface at \u0393 and tubular sheets connecting\nthe H points.\nIn the following we present results from our DFT calculation. FS cross sections were obtained for the (110)\nand (001)-planes. In Fig. 2 schematic representations of\nthe minority and majority FS sheets for the (110) plane,\nparallel to the crystal face used in the experiment, are\nshown. By symmetry of the BZ, the same cut is also obtained for the ( 1 1 0 ) plane perpendicular to the crystal\nsurface. We adopt the labeling of the FS sheets that has\nbeen used in the literature consistently since the work of\nCallaway and Wang [18]. The majority states form sheet\nI to IV, and the minority states form sheet V to VIII, as\nindicated in the figure.\nThe minority FS in Fig. 2(a) shows the cross section\nthrough an octahedrally shaped sheet (VI) around the \u0393\npoint in the center. Surrounding the H points, contours of\nanother octahedron (V) are seen. These are significantly\nlarger than the minority FS sheet in the zone center. An\nimportant detail are the two small spheres (VII) seen at\nthe tips of the sheets V at H. The size of these spherical\nFS sheets depends on the exchange splitting and is rather\nsensitive to the computational method used, as is discussed in more detail below.\nThe much larger majority FS in Fig. 2(b) exhibits as\n(110) = (110) plane\n\na)\n\na)\n\nMINORITY\nN\n\nP\n\nN\n\nP\n\nN\n\n\u0393\n\nH\n\nN\n\nVIII\n\nVIII\n\nH\n\n(001) plane\nMINORITY\n\nV\n\nV\n\nVI\n\nVI\n\n90\u00b0\nH\n\nVII\n\nH\n\n\u0393\n\nN\n\nN\n\nVII\nVIII\nN\n\nN\n\nP\n\nH\n\nN\n\nb)\n\nMAJORITY\nII\n\nN\n\nMAJORITY\n\nI\n\nIII\n\n90\u00b0\n\nII\n\nH\nII\n\nII\n\n[110]\n\n[110], [110]\n\nb)\n\nP\n\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\nIV\n\nIV\n\n[001]\n\n[110]\n\nFIG. 2.

However, in using\nhigh photon energies, one may assume free-electron-like\nfinal states, and the potential step can be modeled by a\nconstant inner potential V0. For a kinetic energy Ekin the\ntotal momentum k0 inside the crystal is therefore given\nby\n2m\nk0 =\nE kin + V0 .\n(1)\nh\nwhere Ekin = h\u03bd - EB- \u03c6A. The binding energy is defined\nas EB = 0 at the Fermi level, and \u03c6A is the work function\nof the analyzer. An ARPES angular sweep at fixed\nbinding energy therefore follows a spherical path in kspace. The use of high photon energies (100 \u2013 140 eV)\nensures that the curvature of this sphere is kept reasonably small. Concerning the individual components of the\nelectron momentum, the parallel momentum k|| does not\nsuffer from a potential step and is given by\n2m\nE kin * sin\u03b8\n(2)\nk|| =\nh\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle against the sample normal. The perpendicular momentum k\u22a5 carries the remainder of the\nkinetic energy and is affected by the potential step:\n2m\n(3)\nk\u22a5 =\nE kin cos 2 \u03b8 + V0 .\nh\nTechnically, an automated sweep of k|| is performed\nwith the detector energy window set to the Fermi level.\nIn addition, the data acquisition technique was extended\nsuch that the full energy spectrum for each k-point was\nrecorded. This is made possible by an imaging detector\narray that simultaneously records a window of energy\nand angles. In this manner, the principal directions of the\nBZ can be determined reliably from the FS data, and\nthen the band maps of interest can be extracted as presented further below.\na) Photon energy scan. In order to determine the location of the symmetry points correctly, a photon energy\nscan was performed, ranging from 75 - 210 eV. This is\nimportant to ensure that the plane containing the \u0393 point\nis intersected correctly. For orientation, a calculated vertical cut of the majority FS with the surface direction\n(110) upward is shown in Fig. 4(a). The weakly curved\npaths sampled by ARPES angle scans are indicated for\ntypical photon energies used in this paper.\nData from the photon energy scan used to identify the\n\u0393 point are shown in Fig. 4(b). In order to obtain high\nintensity for both minority and majority FS surrounding\nthe \u0393 point, the plane chosen for this scan was rotated\n\n21 January 2005\n\na)\n\nN\n\n[110]\n\n139 eV\n\nk\u22a5\n\nH\n\n\u0393\n97 eV\n[001]\n\nk||\n\nkh\u03bd = 0.512* (h\u03bd) 1/2 (\u00c5-1)\n\nb)\n\nh\u03bd\n\nma\n\n7\n\n6\n\nx\n\n=2\n\n10\neV\n\n[110]\n\nPreprint\n\n135.3 eV\n\n\u0393\n\n5\n\n4\n\nh\u03bd\nm\n\nEB = EF\n0\n\nin\n\n= 75\neV\n\n1\n\n2\n\nk||\n\n(\u00c5-1)\n\n3\n\n[112]\n\nFIG. 4. a) Spherical measurement paths resulting for the\nphoton energies utilized in this study, indicated in the DFT\nmajority FS for an angle scan along [001]. b) Determination\nof the photon energy that intersects the \u0393 point in normal\nemission (angle scan along [112] ), color scale indicates\nstates at EF in bright intensity).\n\naround its vertical axis by 35.3o into the [112] direction\npointing from \u0393 to the far N point. The ordinate of the\nphoton energy scan in Fig. 4(b) is the photon energy, on\na scale of k h\u03bd = 2m / h \u22c5 h\u03bd . Although the inner potential V0 is not known a priori, this scale serves as close\napproximation to k\u22a5. At the Fermi level, h\u03bd = Ekin + \u03c6A is\nalmost the same argument under the square root for the\nhigh photon energies used. This scale visualizes the\nsymmetry in the BZ, the distortion being negligible in\nthe vicinity of any given symmetry point, while it remains fully exact when read as photon energy. For normal emission, we observe the \u0393 point at kh\u03bd = 5.96 \u00c5-1\nequivalent to a photon energy of h\u03bd = 135.3 \u00b1 2 eV. This\nimplies an inner potential of V0 = 14.3 eV. Using an approximate sample work function of \u03c6S ~ 4.5 eV, this corresponds to a muffin-tin zero of E0 = V0 - \u03c6S ~ 9.8 eV\nreferenced to the Fermi level. This is in reasonably good\nagreement with the bottom of the valence bands obtained\nfrom the DFT calculation shown below.\nb) FS central plane. The key Fermi surface for the\n(110)-oriented iron crystal face is the cut through the\ncentral plane of the BZ that includes the \u0393 point (plane\n4\n\n\fPreprint\n\nMANUSCRIPT\n\nH\n\nascribe to the deviation of our spherical measurement\narea. At H we estimate the deviation from the \u0393-H-N\nplane to be about 5% of the BZ height, therefore the scan\nwill intersect the tubular FS sheets II connecting the H\npoints at somewhat smaller k||-values.\nConcerning the minority FS sheet VIII and inside of it\nthe majority FS sheet II at the N-point at the top end of\nthe plot, we find that the intensity is much suppressed\nwhich may be due to matrix element effects. However,\nsome faint contour that seems to extend the lines of the \u0393\nmajority contours can be seen. This close vicinity of the\n\u0393 majority contour (I) with the N minority contour (VIII)\nis consistent with the DFT calculation.\nc) FS bottom plane. A FS cross section further away\nfrom the \u0393-H-N plane is shown in Fig. 6. It is recorded\nwith a photon energy of h\u03bd = 97 eV. This corresponds to\nbeing close to the bottom P-H-N-plane of the BZ, see\nFig. 4(a). We note in passing that for both photon energies used for the FS data surface states have a vanishing\ncross section and thus do not show up in the data. For\nnormal emission, the total momentum here is still ~40%\naway from N on the vertical \u0393-N line. For large parallel\nmomentum, however, the scan is rather close to the bottom plane, and intersects it just beyond the H point. The\nARPES FS data of Fig. 6 give a particularly clear-cut\nview of the minority FS hole sheet V surrounding H. The\nsmall minority sheet VII is only faintly seen. The tubular\nFS sheets II are intersected such that four circles are\noverlaid onto the large minority sheet V surrounding H.\nThese four FS sheets extend upwards to the H points in\nthe central plane. The H point is furthermore surrounded\nby small majority contours III and IV, which in the data\ngive rise to a circular structure of moderate intensity.\n\n[110]\n\n\u0393\n\nN\n\nP\n\nN\nII\n\nVIII\n\nky (\u00c5-1)\n\nII\n\nH\n\nIII\nIV\n\nP\nVIII\n[112]\n\nI\nV\n\nII\n\nkx (\u00c5-1)\n\nVI\nVII\n\n21 January 2005\n\n\u0393\n\n[001]\n\nFIG. 5.

For discussion\nsee text.\n\n[110]\n\n\u0393-H-N), as shown in Fig. 5. The curvature of the sphere\ndescribed in k-space with this photon energy vector is\nreasonably small because the photon energy is so high\ncompared to conventional UV spectroscopy in the 20-40\neV range. By choosing a marginally higher photon energy of 139 eV, the weak curvature is corrected such that\nthe central (110)-plane through \u0393 is intersected at k|| =\n1.0 \u00c5-1 away from \u0393, see Fig. 4(a). This is also the average radius of the majority contour I surrounding \u0393, and\nhence enables a rather exact determination of Fermi\nvectors in this area.\nIn Fig. 5 the two contours of minority and majority\nFS are clearly identifiable. In comparing it to the DFT\nFS (see Fig. 2 and overlay on the data in Fig. 5), the\nsmall diamond-shaped contour VI is identified as the minority contour, while the large contour I is the majority\ncontour. Along the \u0393-H axis, and virtually intersected by\nthe majority contour, one finds a small circular contour,\nwhich from the calculation relates to the minute spherical contour VII in the vicinity of the very large minority\ncontour V at H. The fact that the scan intersects these\nminute minority spheres is direct proof that the photon\nenergy was chosen correctly, which otherwise would\nhave missed this minute detail.\nAt the H point, we find a large diamond-shaped contour line that is the minority hole-FS V there. In addition,\nthe small cauliflower-like contours predicted by the calculation for the majority contours (II, III, IV) in Fig. 2(b)\nare also identified. However, they appear somewhat\ncloser to the large majority contour around \u0393 which we\n\nH\n\nky (\u00c5-1)\n\n\u0393\n\nP\n\nkx (\u00c5-1)\n\nP\n\nN\n\n[001]\n\nFIG. 6.

At\nthose large k||-values, the measurement area is close in k\u22a5\nto the far \u0393 point, so that its two centered FS sheets can\nbe seen (I and VI). Combining the experimental ARPES\nresults of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, a rather good general agreement with the calculated FS topology emerges.

The pair of bands for\nminority FS sheet VI and majority FS sheet I that disperse upward from the \u0393 point are seen clearly. At k||\nmarginally larger than Fermi level crossing I, there is a\ncrossing that we ascribe to both sheets V and VII which\nhave a degenerate kF here. Note that in the FS data of\nFig. 5 we find the spherical sheet VII to be larger than\ncalculated, and penetrating sheet I. The sphere VII is intersected twice by the \u0393-H line, yet photoemission intensity is obtained only for that kF closer to H.\nConcerning the remaining two crossings, intensity is\nseen near the H point that must be ascribed to the two\nmajority bands rising above the Fermi level there.

The ARPES band map along the\n\u0393-P direction is shown in Fig. 10. This path intersects\nboth minority and majority Fermi level crossings, at\nkFMin = 0.32 \u00c5-1 and at kFMaj = 0.97 \u00c5-1 corresponding\nto minority sheet VI and majority sheet I, respectively. A\nband minimum is seen for the minority band while for\nthe majority band the intensity is lost at higher binding\nenergy. In addition, a flat band is observed at the P point,\nwith a binding energy of Emin = 0.57 eV. It relates to the\nflat, d-like band seen in the band calculation that does\nextend to the \u0393 point, however, does not show up there\ndue to a lack of intensity (even on a larger binding energy scale than shown). The photoemission cross section\nmay be considered responsible for this behavior, yet correlation effects can furthermore lead to a considerable\nbroadening.\nb) Band map N-\u0393. In Fig. 11 a band map scan along\nthe \u0393-N direction is plotted. In this display one can again\nsee two Fermi level crossings corresponding to the minority sheet VI and majority sheet I, however, the intensity is generally suppressed along this direction. Yet the\nintensity is rather high at the \u0393 point, and one can easily\nidentify the minority band at Emin = 0.19 eV binding energy. The majority band, in contrast, looses intensity as it\ndisperses downward, and cannot be followed to its\nminimum. Very close to N, two more crossings (minority sheet VIII, majority sheet II) are expected, but are not\n\n\u0393\n\nN\nBinding Energy (eV)\n\nkFMaj\n\nI\n\nkFMin\n\nVI\n\nEF\n\n0.19 eV\n\nk|| (\u00c5 -1)\nFIG. 11.

DISCUSSION\n1. Identification of Correlation Effects\nThough DFT includes correlation and exchange contributions to the ground state (and only approximately so\nvia LDA or GGA), the DFT energy bands representing\nthe single-particle excitations are obtained only in a\nmean-field-like fashion. Thus, any deviation of the experimentally observed quasiparticle excitation states\nfrom the DFT bands has to be attributed to correlation\neffects in the electronic self-energy. In particular, the\ndressing of the photohole with virtual electron-hole (or\nother elementary) excitations will lead to a renormalization of the quasiparticle energies, thus affecting the\nFermi velocity, the effective mass, or even the entire occupied bandwidth with respect to the DFT band structure. In the following we give a detailed comparison of\nexperimental and DFT results on Fermi vectors, bandwidths, and Fermi velocities in order to identify such\nelectronic correlation effects.\na) Fermi vectors. A systematic list of the Fermi vectors kF obtained from DFT and from experiment is given\nin Table I in the first pair of data columns. Concerning\nthe Fermi vectors, there is overall very close agreement\nbetween theory and experiment. Allowing an error of\n\u00b10.02 \u00c5-1 for the ARPES readout, most values are well\ncompatible within error bars.\nAlong the \u0393-H line the Fermi level crossing of the\nlarge majority octahedron I is rather well reproduced in\nDFT with kF = 1.05 \u00c5-1, compared to an ARPES value of\n1.08 \u00c5-1. Note that the photon energy was chosen to\nmost exactly intersect the H-\u0393-N plane at this Fermi\nvector of sheet I. However, the small minority Fermi surface sheet VII, which is calculated to be fully inside the\nmajority Fermi surface I, is found to actually overlap\nwith the FS contour I. This is a second minor deviation\nbetween ARPES and DFT. The band situation here is\nvery complicated, see Fig. 8, and the size of the FS\nsheets critically depends on the position of the Fermi\nlevel as well as possible hybridization effects. In particular, spin-orbit splitting not considered in the calculation may be the source of deviations. We note that in the\nearly calculation of Callaway [18], the small FS sphere\nVII does indeed overlap with majority contour I, and is\nalso slightly larger than obtained from the DFT. On the\n\u0393-H line close to H (sheet II) we must expect a larger\ndeviation between DFT and ARPES Fermi vector, as\n\nk|| (\u00c5 -1)\nFIG. 12. ARPES band map along \u0393-H (h\u03bd = 139 eV). In\naddition to the Fermi vector for minority FS sheet VI, two\nFermi vectors for majority sheets I and II are observed. The\nsplitting of the band for I relates to the minority FS VII (see\nalso FS data Fig. 5).\n\none of these bands is identifiable (sheet II), the second\none (which along \u0393-H is a degenerate band derived from\nsheets III and IV) cannot be extrapolated clearly towards\nEF. In particular, both bands loose intensity rather rapidly\nfor higher binding energies near ~ 0.5 eV and beyond.\nd) Band map H-P. The band dispersion along the HP direction is shown in Fig. 13. Well away from H towards P at kF = 0.68 \u00c5-1 a band is seen which, from\ncomparison with the DFT calculation, we relate to minority FS sheet V. Rather close to H, a band is observed\nwhich matches the shape of an inverted parabola with a\nmaximum very close to EF. It relates to the band of majority sheet IV forming a very small surface.

Close to H, high intensity stems from two majority bands which are not expected\nto reach EF on the curved k-path probed by ARPES.\n8\n\n\fPreprint\n\nMANUSCRIPT\n\nsymmetry points, accurate readouts are obtained from\nthe data with high photoemission intensity: i) For the minority band at \u0393 (FS sheet VI), the occupied bandwidth\namounts to 0.26 eV in DFT and 0.19 eV in ARPES, corresponding to a bandwidth reduction of 27 %, i.e. a renormalization ratio of 1.4. ii) For the majority band at P,\nthe occupied bandwidth amounts to 0.85 eV in DFT and\n0.57 eV in ARPES, corresponding to a bandwidth reduction of 33 % equivalent to a renormalization ratio of\n1.5.\nWe thus observe a sizable reduction of bandwidths\nwith respect to the DFT results, attributed to an energy\nrenormalization induced by strong electron-electron interaction in the Fe 3d conduction bands.\nc) Mass renormalization. The Fermi velocity of the\nmetallic bands is a further indicator of interactions experienced by the electrons that are not included in the DFT\ncalculation. We have determined the Fermi velocities vF\nfor both theory and experiment as listed in Table I. For\nthe ARPES data, peak positions of the momentum distribution function have been used to determine the dispersion and its derivative as accurately as possible. The error bar of this procedure is estimated to be \u00b1 15% for the\nexperimental data.\nMass renormalization factors can easily be derived as\nthe ratio of the experimental and calculated Fermi velocities, and are listed in Table I. Values ranging from\n1.1 to 3.6 are observed, with a total error of the order of\n\u00b1 20 %. The observed mass renormalization ratios are\ntherefore significantly larger than unity, even admitting\nthe experimental uncertainty. A comparison of effective\nelectron masses from de Haas-van Alphen experiments\nwith band structure calculations performed by Lonzarich\n[11] also leads to mass renormalization ratios in the\nrange of 1.5 to 3, consistent with our ARPES data.\nThese numbers determined near the Fermi level are\nlarger than the ARPES bandwidth renormalization of 1.4\n\u2013 1.5. If it were a uniform scattering mechanism, a\nroughly constant renormalization ratio for the whole energy range below EF would be expected. A significantly\nlarger renormalization ratio at low binding energies,\nhowever, points at an additional interaction mechanism.\n\nTABLE I.

Overall, however,\nthe variance of the calculational DFT Fermi vectors is\ngenerally rather minute when compared to ARPES. We\nhence conclude that despite the pronounced energy renormalization discussed below, the experimental Fermi\nsurface is well reproduced by band theory in accordance\nwith Luttinger's sum rule.\nb) Band energies at critical points. Band energies\nmay also be compared between DFT and ARPES. As\nmentioned before, for some bands the band minimum\ncannot be observed because the intensity fades out for\nhigher binding energies. The complete loss of intensity\nin the quasiparticle peak obtained with ARPES has also\nbeen reported for cobalt, where the suppression is particularly pronounced for binding energies higher than 2\neV [27].\nFor the band minima with not so high binding energies, from the close-up band structure panels of Fig. 8\nwe infer that shallow band minima are expected at the \u0393\npoint, at the P point, and along the \u0393-N direction. Unfortunately, the \u0393-N line has a very low cross section, as\nseen e.g. in the Fermi surface of Fig. 5, and the multiple\nband situation is not reflected in the data. For the \u0393 and P\n\n2. Discussion of Renormalization\na) Systematics of renormalization. The data show no\nevident systematics such that either spin type (minority\nor majority) would be renormalized considerably\nstronger than the other. The largest renormalization ratios of three and more are observed at \u0393-P and \u0393-H for\nmajority carriers, while at H-P this value is assumed by\nthe minority spins. A larger scattering rate for minority\nstates has been observed in Gd for bands near the Fermi\nlevel by Valla et al. [28] and is explained by the higher\nmajority density of states available for scattering into\nminority holes. For surface states of Fe, unoccupied\n9\n\n\fPreprint\n\nMANUSCRIPT\n\nstates seen in inverse photoemission showed longer living majority than minority states [29]. Scattering asymmetries were also discussed by Hong et al. in conjunction with interaction of electrons with spin waves [30,\n31]. Unlike Valla et al., their argument implies a\nstronger scattering for holes in a majority band, which\nwill be filled by minority electrons under emission of a\nspin wave that compensates the increase in magnetization. Our data, however, do not support preferential interactions for either spin channel.\nAnother obvious relationship to look for is the orbital\ncharacter of the states at EF. Here we refer to Fig. 9 and\nrecall that d-t2g character is predominant there. As there\nis little change in the orbital symmetry across the FS, it\ncannot explain the considerable variance in the mass renormalization observed.\nRather, it appears as general trend that large mass renormalizations are observed for large Fermi surface\nsheets. This is visualized in Fig. 14, where those points\non the FS sheets are marked where determinations of the\nmass renormalization have been made. The behavior\nmay imply a complex k-dependence, yet the most obvious statement would be that more scattering channels are\navailable for electrons on a large FS sheet. Scattering occurs predominantly with spins of opposite sign due to the\nlarger interaction strength, as argued by Monastra et al.\nfor Co [27]. One may speculate that the vicinity of FS\nsheets of opposite sign and much smaller occupied fraction serves as large phase space of unoccupied states\nwhere opposite spin electron-hole pairs can be created\nabundantly.\nb) Theoretical treatment of self-energy effects in Fe.\nAttempts have been made to incorporate the interaction\nbetween the electrons, as observed in the ARPES spectra, in a theoretical computation of a quasiparticle band\nstructure [32,33,34,35,36,37]. It is found that quasipartiN\n\nP\n\nN\n\nP\n\ncles in Fe beyond 1 eV are strongly damped [32]. Inclusion of the on-site Coulomb interaction of localized\nelectrons. [34] reproduces the correlation satellite in the\nspectra of Fe, Co, and Ni. It leads to an interaction energy U which for Fe is not much smaller than for Ni, in\ncontrast to old photoemission experiments which suggested rather weak effects for Fe. Moreover, inclusion of\nelectron correlations in Fe using LDA-DFT plus a dynamic mean-field approximation requires U to be as\nlarge as 4 eV to provide reasonable agreement with\nphotoemission spectra [35].\nIn a Green function approach [36] quasiparticle renormalization factors are obtained which for the delectrons are 1.7 in Ni and 1.4 in Fe, suggesting strong\nmany-body interactions in both materials. In addition, a\nmassive broadening of the density of states is observed\nbeyond 1-2 eV binding energy. A related treatment using\nthe GW method [37] generates a rather sizeable bandwidth reduction of the order of 25 % which is comparable to our data. These theoretical approaches are thus in\nsupport of a significant role of correlations for ferromagnetic iron.\nc) Comparison to Ni. Bandwidth renormalization has\nlong been known to occur in Ni [38]. The effect has\nlately been studied in more detail with modern highresolution ARPES [39,40,41], and a bandwidth renormalization for the 3d bands of 27-30 % is observed.\nAlso, a correlation satellite ~ 6 eV below EF has been\nestablished for Ni from photoemission data [2]. Our current ARPES data suggest a very similar situation for Fe.\nWe note that this finding relates to the bands close to the\nFermi level, where we observe bandwidth reductions of\n~30 %. Deeper binding energies in Fe were explored in\nolder work, finding a bandwidth reduction of about 10 %\nthere [5]. For the sp-like bands of Ni, the effect there is\nalso rather small [38]. From this comparison it emerges\nthat the bandwidth renormalization effects in Fe are not\nsignificantly smaller than in Ni, and the similarities of\nthese two ferromagnets are rather striking.\nd) Relevance of magnetic excitations. While the\nbandwidth renormalization is thus well accounted for by\ninterelectronic Coulomb interaction, the enormous renormalization factors up to ~3 observed near the Fermi\nenergy indicate the presence of additional scattering processes at low excitation energies. A possible candidate is\nthe coupling between conduction electrons and spin excitations.\nRecently, the formation of quasiparticles due to electron-magnon coupling has been identified in the ARPES\nspectrum of Fe(110) surface states by means of their\nparticular self-energy signature [12]. Interaction of electrons with magnetic excitations in Fe films has also been\nobserved in the spin-polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy [42,43], leading to structure at 250 meV and\nbelow.\n\nN\n\n2.0\n\nI\n3.0\n\nII\n\nH\n\nN\n\nV\n\n3.6\n\nVI\n\n1.1\n\n1.8\n2.0\n3.4\n\n\u0393\n\nP\n\nH\n\n1.4\n\nN\n\nP\n\n21 January 2005\n\nN\n\nFIG. 14.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn the pursuit of identifying correlation effects in ferromagnetic iron, ARPES has been used to establish highaccuracy Fermi surfaces for the first time, together with\nthe quasiparticle band structure along various principal\ndirections. Essential features of the Fermi surface can be\nrather accurately described with the DFT-GGA method.\nMany-body effects become obvious when the ARPES\nquasiparticle dispersions in the d-band region are analyzed. A considerable band with reduction of about 30 %\ncompared to DFT is observed. These renormalization effects imply significant correlation effects due to electronelectron interaction. The bandwidth reduction is consistent with expectations based on various theoretical\ntreatments for Fe. Surprisingly, much stronger mass renormalization is found very close to the Fermi level,\nwith a drastic mass enhancement of up to a factor of\nthree or more. In this low energy range, coupling to spin\nwave excitations seems to play an important role.\nFrom these results we conclude - in contrast to earlier\nARPES studies - that electronic correlations in Fe are\njust as strong as in the other two ferromagnetic 3d metals\nNi and Co. As an outlook and challenge to solid-state\ntheory, it would be highly desirable to have a microscopic description of the quasiparticle band structure of\nFe which is capable of reproducing the mass renormalization effects especially at the Fermi level.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful to A.
