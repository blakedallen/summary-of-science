In the paper, an explicit formula for the related Lipschitz\nconstant is obtained.\nPACS number 02.10.Ud; 02.10.Yn\nMSC 2000:\n\n15A18; 15A60\n\nKey words and phrases: Joint spectral radius, generalized spectral\nradius, Lipschitz constant, Barabanov norms, irreducibility\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation about the rate of growth of matrix products with factors taken\nfrom some matrix set is of great importance in various problems of control\ntheory [1\u20133], wavelet theory [4\u20136] and other fields of mathematics. One of the\nmost prominent values characterizing the exponential rate of growth of matrix\nproducts is the so-called joint or generalized spectral radius.\nLet K = R, C be the field of real or complex numbers, and A \u2282 Kd\u00d7d be a\nset of d \u00d7 d matrices. As usual, for n \u2265 1 denote by A n the set of all n-products\nof matrices from A ; A 0 = I.\nGiven a norm k * k in Kd , the limit\n\u03c1(A ) = lim sup kA n k1/n ,\n\n(1)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwith kA n k = supA\u2208A n kAk is called the joint spectral radius of the matrix set\nA [7]. The limit in (1) is finite for bounded matrix sets A \u2282 Kd\u00d7d and does\nnot depend on the norm k * k. As shown in [7], for any n \u2265 1 the estimates\n\u2217 Supported by the Federal Agency for Science and Innovations of Russian Federation,\ncontract no. 02.740.11.5048, and by Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project no. 1001-00175.\n\n1\n\n\f\u03c1(A ) \u2264 kA n k1/n hold, and therefore the joint spectral radius can be defined\nalso by the following formula:\n\u03c1(A ) = inf kA n k1/n .\n\n(2)\n\nn\u22651\n\nIf A is a singleton set then (1) turns into the known Gelfand formula for the\nspectral radius of a linear operator. By this reason sometimes (1) is called the\ngeneralized Gelfand formula [8].\nBesides (1) and (2), there are quite a number of different equivalent definitions of \u03c1(A ) in which the norm in (1) is replaced by the spectral radius\n[4, 5, 9] or the trace of a matrix [10], or by a uniform non-negative polynomial\nof even degree [11]. Sometimes \u03c1(A ) is defined in terms of existence of specific\nnorms [2, 12] (the Barabanov and Protasov norms). Unfortunately, the common feature of all the mentioned definitions is their nonconstructivity. In all\nthese definitions the value of \u03c1(A ) is defined either as a certain limit or as a\nresult of some \"existence theorems\", which essentially complicates the analysis\nof properties of the joint spectral radius.\nIn the paper, we are concerned with properties of the joint spectral radius\n\u03c1(A ) as a function of A for compact (i.e. closed and bounded) matrix sets A .\nIn this case it is convenient to denote the set of all nonempty bounded subsets\nof Kd\u00d7d by B(Kd\u00d7d ), and the set of all nonempty compact subsets of Kd\u00d7d by\nK (Kd\u00d7d ). Both of these sets become metric spaces if to endow them with the\nusual Hausdorff metric\n\u001a\n\u001b\nH(A , B) := max sup inf kA \u2212 Bk, sup inf kA \u2212 Bk .\nA\u2208A B\u2208B\n\nB\u2208B A\u2208A\n\nd\u00d7d\n\nIn doing so the space K (K\n) is proved to be complete while the set I (Kd\u00d7d )\nof all irreducible compact matrix families is open and dense in K (Kd\u00d7d ).\nIn 2002 F. Wirth has proved [13, Cor. 4.2] that the joint spectral radius of\nirreducible compact matrix sets satisfies the local Lipschitz condition.\nWirth's Theorem. For any compact set P \u2282 I (Kd\u00d7d ) there is a constant C\n(depending on P and the norm k * k in Kd\u00d7d ) such that\n|\u03c1(A ) \u2212 \u03c1(B)| \u2264 C * H(A , B),\n\n\u2200 A , B \u2208 P.\n\nThe aim of the present paper is to obtain an explicit expression for the\nconstant C in the above inequality.\nAs demonstrated the following example the joint spectral radius is not locally\nLipschitz continuous if to discard supposition about irreducibility of a matrix\nset.\nExample 1. Consider the matrix set A\u03b5 composed of a single matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\nA\u03b5 =\n,\n\u03b5 1\ndepending on the real parameter \u03b5 > 0.\nClearly,\nthe singleton matrix set A0 is not irreducible. Besides, \u03c1(A\u03b5 ) =\n\u221a\n1 + \u03b5, and therefore\n\u221a\n|\u03c1(A\u03b5 ) \u2212 \u03c1(A0 )| = |\u03c1(A\u03b5 ) \u2212 \u03c1(A0 )| = \u03b5,\nwhereas H(A\u03b5 , A0 ) = kA\u03b5 \u2212 A0 k = \u03b5c, where c is some constant.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nMain result\n\nGiven a matrix set A \u2282 Kd\u00d7d\nS, for each n \u2265 1 denote by An the set of all kproducts of matrices from A {I} with k \u2264 n, that is An = \u222ank=0 A k . Denote\nalso by An (x) the set of all the vectors Ax with A \u2208 An . Let k * k be a norm in\nKd then S(t) stands for the ball of radius t in this norm.\nLet us call the p-measure of irreducibility of the matrix set A (with respect\nto the norm k * k) the quantity \u03c7p (A ) determined as\n\u03c7p (A ) = inf sup{t : S(t) \u2286 conv{Ap (x) \u222a Ap (\u2212x)}}.\nx\u2208Rd\nkxk=1\n\nUnder the name 'the measure of quasi-controllability' the measure of irreducibility \u03c7p (A ) was introduced and investigated in [14\u201316] where the overshooting effects for the transient regimes of linear remote control systems were\nstudied. The reason why the quantity \u03c7p (A ) got the name 'the measure of\nirreducibility' is in the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let p \u2265 d \u2212 1. The matrix set A is irreducible if and only if\n\u03c7p (A ) > 0.\nThe proof of Lemma 1 can be found in [15, 16]. In these works it is proved\nalso that, for compact irreducible matrix sets, the quantity \u03c7p (A ) continuously\ndepends on A in the Hausdorff metric.\nTheorem 1. For any pair of matrix sets A \u2208 I (Kd\u00d7d ), B \u2208 B(Kd\u00d7d ) for\neach p \u2265 d \u2212 1 it is valid the inequality\n|\u03c1(A ) \u2212 \u03c1(B)| \u2264 \u03bdp (A )H(A , B),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u03bdp (A ) =\n\nmax{1, kA kp }\n.\n\u03c7p (A )\n\nTaking into account that the quantity \u03bdp (A ) continuously depends on A\nin the Hausdorff metric, and hence it is bounded on any compact set P \u2282\nI (Kd\u00d7d ), Theorem 1 implies Wirth's Theorem. However, unlike to Wirth's\nTheorem, in Theorem 1 neither compactness nor irreducibility of the matrix set\nB is assumed.\nAs will be shown below under the proof of Theorem 1, in fact even more\naccurate estimate than (3) holds:\n|\u03c1(A ) \u2212 \u03c1(B)| \u2264\n\nmax{1, (\u03c1(A ))p }\nH(A , B).\n\u03c7p (A )\n\nHowever, this last estimate is not quite satisfactory because practical evaluation\nof the quantity \u03c1(A ) is a problem. At the same time the quantity \u03bdp (A ) in\n(3) can be evaluated in a finite number of algebraic operations involving only\ninformation about A .\nRemark also that whereas the value of the joint spectral radius is independent\nof a norm in Kd\u00d7d , the quantities \u03bdp (A ), \u03c7p (A ) and H(A , B) in (3) do depend\non the choice of the norm k * k in Kd\u00d7d .\n3\n\n\fAt last, point out that in the case when both of the matrix sets A and B\nare irreducible and compact, that is A , B \u2208 I (Kd\u00d7d ), inequality (3) can be\nformally strengthened:\n|\u03c1(A ) \u2212 \u03c1(B)| \u2264 min {\u03bdp (A ), \u03bdp (B)} H(A , B).\n\n3\n\nAuxiliary statements\n\nTo prove Theorem 1 we will need some auxiliary notions and facts related to\nthe irreducible matrix sets. The principal technical tool in proving Theorem 1\nwill be the notion of the Barabanov norm mentioned above, existence of which\nfollows from the next theorem [2].\nBarabanov's Theorem. The quantity \u03c1 is the joint (generalized) spectral radius of the matrix set A \u2208 I (Kd\u00d7d ) if and only if there is a norm k * kb in Kd\nsuch that\n\u03c1kxkb \u2261 max kAxkb .\n\n(4)\n\nA\u2208A\n\nIn what follows a norm satisfying (4) is called a Barabanov norm corresponding to the matrix set A .\nIn the next elementary lemma, a simple way to get both upper and lower\nestimates for the joint spectral radius is suggested.\nLemma 2. Let A be a nonempty matrix set from Kd\u00d7d . If, for some \u03b1,\nsup kAxk \u2264 \u03b1kxk,\n\nA\u2208A\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd ,\n\n(5)\n\nthen \u03c1(A ) \u2264 \u03b1. If, for some \u03b2,\nsup kAxk \u2265 \u03b2kxk,\n\nA\u2208A\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd ,\n\n(6)\n\nthen \u03c1(A ) \u2265 \u03b2.\nProof. Clearly, the constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 may be thought of as non-negative. To\nprove the first claim note that (5) implies the inequality kA k = supA\u2208A kAk \u2264\n\u03b1. Then kA n k = supAi \u2208A kAn * * * A2 A1 k \u2264 \u03b1n , and \u03c1(A ) \u2264 \u03b1 by the definition\n(1).\nSimilarly, to prove the second claim note that (6) implies, for each n =\n1, 2, . . . , the inequality\nsup kAn * * * A2 A1 xk = sup sup . . . sup kAn * * * A2 A1 xk\n\nAi \u2208A\n\nA1 \u2208A A2 \u2208A\n\nAn \u2208A\n\n\u2265 \u03b2 n kxk,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd .\n\nHence supAi \u2208A kAn * * * A2 A1 k \u2265 \u03b2 n . Then kA n k = supAi \u2208A kAn * * * A2 A1 k \u2265\n\u03b2 n , and \u03c1(A ) \u2265 \u03b2 by the definition (1). The lemma is proved.\nFollowing to [17], for convenience of comparison of norms in Kd let us introduce an appropriate notion. Given two norms k * k\u2032 and k * k\u2032\u2032 in Kd , define the\nquantities\ne\u2212 (k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 ) = min\nx6=0\n\nkxk\u2032\n,\nkxk\u2032\u2032\n\ne+ (k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 ) = max\nx6=0\n\n4\n\nkxk\u2032\n.\nkxk\u2032\u2032\n\n(7)\n\n\fSince all norms in Kd are equivalent then the quantities e\u2212 (*) and e+ (*) are\nwell defined, and\n0 < e\u2212 (k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 e+ (k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 ) < \u221e.\nTherefore the quantity\necc(k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 ) =\n\ne+ (k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 )\n\u2265 1,\ne\u2212 (k * k\u2032 , k * k\u2032\u2032 )\n\n(8)\n\ncalled the eccentricity of the norm k * k\u2032 with respect to the norm k * k\u2032\u2032 , is also\nwell defined.\n\n4\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nWe will prove Theorem 1 in two steps. First, slightly modifying the idea of the\nproof from [13, Cor. 4.2], we will show in Section 4.1 that under the conditions\nof Theorem 1 the eccentricity of any Barabanov norm k * kA for the matrix set\nA with respect to the norm k * k may serve as the Lipschitz constant for the\njoint spectral radius, that is\n|\u03c1(A ) \u2212 \u03c1(B)| \u2264 ecc(k * kA , k * k)H(A , B).\n\n(9)\n\nThen, using the techniques of the measures of irreducibility (see, e.g., [14, 16,\n18]), we will prove in Section 4.2 the estimate\necc(k * kA , k * k) \u2264 \u03bdp (A ) :=\n\n4.1\n\nmax{1, kA kp }\n.\n\u03c7p (A )\n\n(10)\n\nProof of estimate (9)\n\nLet k * kA be some Barabanov norm for the matrix set A . By definition of the\nHausdorff metric, for any matrix B \u2208 B there is a matrix AB \u2208 A such that\nkB \u2212 AB k \u2264 H(A , B). Then, by definition of the eccentricity of the norm k *kA\nwith respect to the norm k * k,\nkB \u2212 AB kA \u2264 C * kB \u2212 AB k \u2264 C * H(A , B),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere C = ecc(k * kA , k * k).\nConsider the obvious inequality\nkBxkA \u2264 kAB xkA + k(B \u2212 AB )xkA ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd .\n\nHere kAB xkA \u2264 \u03c1(A )kxkA because k * kA is a Barabanov norm for the matrix\nset A , and k(B \u2212 AB )xkA \u2264 C * H(A , B)kxkA by inequality (11). Therefore\nkBxkA \u2264 (\u03c1(A ) + C * H(A , B)) kxkA ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd ,\n\nand, due to arbitrariness of B \u2208 B,\nsup kBxkA \u2264 (\u03c1(A ) + C * H(A , B)) kxkA ,\n\nB\u2208B\n\n5\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd .\n\n\fFrom here by Lemma 2\n\u03c1(B) \u2264 \u03c1(A ) + C * H(A , B).\n\n(12)\n\nNow, let us prove that\n\u03c1(B) \u2265 \u03c1(A ) \u2212 C * H(A , B).\n\n(13)\n\nBy definition of the Hausdorff metric, for any matrix A \u2208 A there is a matrix\nBA \u2208 B such that kBA \u2212 Ak \u2264 H(A , B). Then, as before,\nkBA \u2212 AkA \u2264 C * kBA \u2212 Ak \u2264 C * H(A , B).\n\n(14)\n\nBy evaluating with the help of (14) the second summand in the next obvious\ninequality\nkBA xkA \u2265 kAxkA \u2212 k(BA \u2212 A)xkA ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd ,\n\nwe obtain:\nkBA xkA \u2265 kAxkA \u2212 C * H(A , B)kxkA ,\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd .\n\nMaximizing now the both sides of this last inequality over all A \u2208 A (which is\npossible due to arbitrariness of A \u2208 A ), we get:\nsup kBA xkA \u2265 sup kAxkA \u2212 C * H(A , B)kxkA ,\n\nA\u2208A\n\nA\u2208A\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 Kd .\n\nHere the left-hand part of the inequality does not exceed supB\u2208B kBxkA , while\nby Barabanov's Theorem supA\u2208A kAxkA \u2261 \u03c1(A )kxkA .

If\nk\n\u00c3i = I then k\u00c3i kA = 1. If \u00c3i = Aik * * * Ai1 then k\u00c3i kA \u2264 (\u03c1(A )) because,\nby definition of the Barabanov norm, k\u00c3ij kA \u2264 \u03c1(A ) for any matrix Aij \u2208 A .\nTherefore\nk\n\np\n\nk\u00c3i kA \u2264 max{1, (\u03c1(A )) } \u2264 max{1, (\u03c1(A )) },\nand (16) implies\np\n\n\u03c7p (A )kx+ kA \u2264 max {1, (\u03c1(A )) } kx\u2212 kA .\nFrom here and from (15)\necc(k * kA , k * k) \u2264\n\nmax{1, (\u03c1(A ))p }\n,\n\u03c7p (A )\n\nand, since \u03c1(A ) \u2264 kA k by (2), this last inequality implies the estimate (10),\nwhich finalizes the second step of the proof.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is completed.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
