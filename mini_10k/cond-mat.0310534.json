Polymer theory in general is one of the prime fields\nwhere renormalization group theory can be used and\ncompared in detail with real experiments [3, 4]. The simplest non-trivial objects in this respect are the partition\nsum and the r.m.s. end-to-end distance of a single long\nflexible linear (unbranched) polymer with N monomers\nin a good solvent, which scale as\nZN \u223c \u03bc\u2212N N \u03b3\u22121\n\n(1)\n\n2\nRN\n\u2248 A1 N 2\u03bd .\n\n(2)\n\nand\n\nStar polymers, i.e. f such chains linked together at a single point, are some of the simplest examples of polymers\nwith non-trivial topology. As shown by Duplantier [5],\nall such polymer networks are characterized by equations\nsimilar to Eqs. (1) and (2), with the critical fugacity \u03bc\nand the critical exponent \u03bd being the same for all topologies, but with \u03b3 being universal only within each topology. For star polymers composed of f arms of length N\neach, one has in particular\nZN,f \u223c \u03bc\u2212f N N \u03b3f \u22121\n\n(3)\n\n2\nRN,f\n\u2248 Af N 2\u03bd ,\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\nwhere RN,f is the r.m.s. Euclidean center-to-end distance.\nThe behaviour of \u03b3f and of the swelling factor Af are of\ncentral interest, both for finite f and for f \u2192 \u221e. In two\ndimensions, \u03b3f can be calculated exactly using conformal\ninvariance [5], but no exact results are known for d = 3.\nRenormalization group methods give \u01eb expansions up to\n\nthird power in \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d [6], but these are non-convergent\npower series and have to be resummed before being applicable in d = 3. The results are debated, in particular for\nlarge values of f [7]. For the swelling factor the situation\nis similarly unclear. Phenomenologists tend to compare\nwith predictions based on Gaussian (i.e. free) chains [8]\nor on heuristic assumptions [9, 10]. There exist several\nrenormalization group calculations, but those not based\nheavily on simulation data [11, 12] seem to describe some\nof the data rather poorly, and Monte Carlo simulations\nare needed to fix free parameters in such theories [13, 14].\nIn view of this, Monte Carlo [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\nand molecular dynamics [21, 22] simulations have played\na major role in the efforts to understand the behaviour of\nstar polymers. Molecular dynamics simulations [22] have\nindeed been used to study very large stars, with up to 80\narms of length N = 100 each, but it is not clear whether\nthese simulations have really reached equilibrium. Moreover, both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods\nwith fixed chain lengths (including the pivot algorithm\n[14, 20]) cannot measure the partition sum and thus give\nno information on \u03b3f . For the latter one has to use chain\ngrowth methods [15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23]. Unfortunately,\nwith the methods used so far it has not been possible to\ngo beyond 24 arms [17], and even these were too short\nand the data were too noisy to provide a clear cut picture\nof the asymptotic behaviour.\nWe decided therefore to perform simulations with several improvements which allow us to reach much larger\nsystems and much higher accuracy. To obtain a good estimate for \u03bc and for the critical exponents of unbranched\npolymers, we also made extensive simulations of linear\nchains. The model and the method of simulation are described in the next section. Results are given in Sec. 3,\nwhile we end with a discussion in Sec. 4.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nLet us first describe in detail our model. For efficiency,\nand since we are only interested in scaling behaviour, we\n\n\f2\nuse a lattice model. Indeed, we use the simplest version, the simple cubic lattice. But instead of simulating\nself avoiding walks as in previous works, we simulate the\nDomb-Joyce model [24] at its 'magic' interaction strength\nv = v \u2217 . In the Domb-Joyce model polymers are described\nby lattice walks where monomers sit at sites and are connected by bonds of length 1. Multiple visits to the same\nsite are allowed, but for any pair of monomers occupying\nthe same site one has a repulsive energy \u01eb > 0 giving rise\nto a Boltzmann factor v = exp(\u2212\u03b2\u01eb) < 1. The partition\nsum of a linear chain molecule of N + 1 monomers is thus\na sum over all walks of N steps, each weighted with v m\nwhere m isP\nthe total number of pairs occupying the same\nsite, m = i<j \u03b4xi ,xj . For star polymers we studied in\nthe present work two variants. In both variants arms of\nN monomers are attached to a central site. In the first\nvariant, the central site is singly occupied. In the second, it is occupied by f monomers, one for each arm.\nWe studied both variants in order to verify that results\nwere independent of this detail, and we include in our\nfinal error estimates the uncertainty it entails.\nUsing the Domb-Joyce model has two main advantages. First of all, it allows us to attach a large number\nof arms to a point-like center. In the present work, we go\nup to f = 80 [25]. Previously, authors had used extended\ncores. Although these cores were much smaller than the\nradii of the polymers themselves and should thus not destroy the asymptotic scaling, they do introduce a finite\nlength scale and present therefore corrections to scaling\nterms which complicate the analysis.\nMore important is that there is one special ('magic')\nvalue of v, called v \u2217 in the following, where corrections to\nscaling are minimal and where asymptotic scaling laws\nare reached fastest. For single chains it has been estimated [26, 27] as v \u2217 \u2248 0.6 with rather small error bars,\nand we shall in the following assume this value to be exact. In the renormalization group language, the flow of\nthe effective Hamiltonian to its fixed point in the stable\nmanifold of the latter contains one direction of slowest\napproach. For a generic starting point there is a non-zero\ncomponent in this direction, which then determines the\nleading correction to scaling. If one starts however with\nthe flow such that this component is absent, the approach\nto scaling is governed by the next-to-leading correction\nterm and is much faster. A similar observation has been\nmade also for off-lattice bead-rod models with fixed bond\nlength, where the leading corrections to scaling are absent for a certain 'magic' ratio between bead size and rod\nlength [28, 29, 30].\nSince the value of v \u2217 should depend only on the internal structure of the chains, for star polymers it should\nbe independent of the number of arms. For the beadrod model this was carefully verified in [14]. We thus\nsimulated only with v = v \u2217 .\nFor our simulations we used the pruned-enriched\nRosenbluth method (PERM) [31]. This is a biased chain\ngrowth algorithm, similar to the Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth\n[32] method. In the latter, the bias induced by avoid-\n\ning double occupancy is compensated by a weight factor which is basically of entropic origin. In the present\ncase, we have both a bias compensating factor and a\nBoltzmann factor, the product of which tends to fluctuate wildly if there is no perfect importance sampling.\nThese fluctuations are suppressed in PERM by pruning\nlow weight configurations and cloning those with high\nweight. Indeed, any bias can be employed in PERM, as\nlong as it can be compensated by a weight factor. In previous simulations of diluted polymers we use a Markov\napproximation called Markovian anticipation [33, 34, 35].\nIn the present case we did not expect this to be very useful, because the main interactions are not within one arm\nbut between different arms. Thus we used instead a very\nsimple bias where each arm tends to grow preferentially\noutward (except for the simulations for f = 1 where we\nused of course Markovian anticipation). The strength of\nthis bias was adjusted by trial and error. It decreased\nwith the length of the arm and increased with f . Details will not be given since they are not very important,\nand working without this bias would have increased the\nerrors by only a factor \u2248 2, in general.\nA final comment is that it is easy to modify the basic\nPERM algorithm given e.g. in the appendix of [31] such\nthat all f arms are grown simultaneously [36]. This is\ndone by having f growth sites x1 , . . . xf . Chain growth\nis made in PERM by calling recursively a subroutine for\neach monomer addition. For multi-arm growth, we add\nan integer k \u2208 [1, . . . f ] to the argument list of this subroutine, such that a subroutine called itself with argument k calls the next subroutine with (k mod f ) + 1.\nIn this way a monomer is added to each arm before the\nnext round of monomers is added. Compared to a scheme\nwhere one arm is grown entirely before the next arm is\nstarted, the main advantage is that each chain grows in\nthe field of all the others, and is thus, by the population\ncontrol (pruning/cloning), guided to grow into the correct outward direction. If chains were grown one after\nthe other, this bias would be absent for the first chains\nwhich then would grow into \"wrong\" directions, resulting\nin very low weight configurations.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPartition Sums and \u03b3-Exponents\n\nOne of the outstanding features of chain growth methods such as PERM is that they give estimates for the\npartition sum. Indeed, these estimates are a basic part\nof the simulations, since the population control is based\non these estimates.\nAccording to Eq. (3) we expect ZN,f \u03bcf N to approach\na power law const N \u03b3f \u22121 at large N . One precise\nway to estimate \u03b3f is to subtract a term af ln N from\nln(ZN,f \u03bcf N ), and adjust the constant af such that the\ndifference gives a flat curve for large N , when plotted\nagainst ln N . This gives then \u03b3f = 1 + af .

The fact that we find\nessentially a straight line (apart from odd/even oscillations due to the special structure of the cubic lattice)\nindicates that the leading correction to scaling exponent\nis \u2206 \u2248 0.96 which is much larger than the value \u2206 \u2248 1/2\nfor generic self avoiding walks, indicating that v = 0.6 is\nindeed close to the magic value.

We\nprefer both methods over a least square fit, say, since they\nallow directly to check visually for the presence of corrections to scaling. If such corrections seem needed, one can\nsubtract them and obtain in this way the most reliable\nand precise estimates of \u03b3f \u2013 remembering of course that\nestimating a critical index involves an extrapolation and\nis thus ill-posed, giving at best subjective error estimates.\nFor either method we need precise estimates of the partition sum of linear chains. We thus performed first extensive simulations of linear (f = 1) Domb-Joyce chains,\ncreating altogether \u2248 4 \u00d7 108 chains of length N = 8000.\nIn Fig. 1 we plot effective exponents obtained from triple\ny\nx\nratios [26] ZaN\nZbN\n/ZN . Here a and b are chosen such\nas to minimize statistical and systematic errors [26], and\npowers x and y are fixed such that \u03bc and the overall\nnormalization drop out. With a = 1/3 and b = 5 we\nhave\n\n(7)\n\nAfter having obtained a precise estimate for \u03bc, we can\nnow discuss the results for stars. Results for a few selected values of f are shown in Fig. 2. We plot there\nln ZN,f + f N ln \u03bc for both variants, i.e. the center singly\noccupied or f times occupied. The latter gives smaller\nvalues of ZN,f , but the difference is visible only for\nN = 2. For larger N both agree, except for f = 80 and\nlarge values of N where our sampling algorithm starts to\nbreak down.\nFor a precise estimate of \u03b3f we of course did not use\nplots like Fig. 2, but we subtracted (\u03b3f \u2212 1) ln N as explained above. Then we see (Fig. 3) that there are nonnegligible corrections to scaling, but our arms are long\nenough so that our estimates of \u03b3f are not affected by\nthem. Our final results, obtained by averaging over both\nvariants of the model, are shown in Table 1 and in Fig. 4.\nIn Table 1 we also give additional information such as the\narm lengths and the total statistics. We also list previous\nestimates for comparison.

We should add that the simulations in [16]\ninvolved much shorter chains and lower statistics.\nPrevious theoretical predictions of \u03b3f used \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d\n- expansions [6, 7] and the cone approximation [38, 39].\nThe latter assumes that each branch is confined to a cone\nof space angle 4\u03c0/f , and gives\n\u03b3f \u2212 1 \u223c \u2212f 3/2 .\n\n(8)\n\nAs seen from Fig. 4 this is not too far off, but it definitely\ndoes not provide a quantitative fit to our data.

Thus it cannot be used without re-summation. Such re-summations\nhave not yet been attempted for f \u2192 \u221e. For small f ,\nresults are given in [6, 7], and are listed in Table 1. They\nare in the right order of magnitude, but their precision\nis not sufficient to draw any firm conclusion beyond the\nfact that the resummed \u01eb - expansion is obviously not in\nconflict with the Monte Carlo data.\nCoil Sizes\n\nWe measured only rms. center-to-end distances of the\narms (resp. end-to-end distances for f = 1). This was\ndone 'on the fly', i.e. we did not store each configuration\nand measure its properties in a second step of analysis.\nThe reason is that an off-line analysis would have required very large files, and reading a configuration from\ndisk or tape would have been not much faster than creating it from scratch. We neither measured shape parameters nor radii of gyration, since any such additional\nmeasurement would have slowed down the analysis considerably, and since the main purpose of the present work\nwas to demonstrate the efficiency of PERM and to study\nthe main universal properties of large stars.\nAs for \u03b3f , we first need a careful analysis of linear chains, to obtain precise estimates of \u03bd and of the\namplitude A1 .

Extrapolating to N \u2192 \u221e we find \u03bd = 0.58767(20).

The resulting amplitude is then\n2\nA1 = lim RN\n/N 2\u03bd = 0.8038 \u00b1 0.0005 .\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(10)\n\nTo obtain the amplitudes Af for stars we assume\nthe value of \u03bd as given above. We can then plot ei2\nther RN,f\n/N 2\u03bd versus N (which gives Af directly), or\n2\n2\nRN,f\n/RN\nversus N , which gives Af /A1 . To check for\nsystematic corrections we did both. Some typical curves\nobtained with the first method are shown in Fig. 6. For\neach value of f we see two curves, one for each variant\nof the model: The upper curve is always that with the\ncenter f times occupied, the lower one corresponds to a\nsingly occupied center. For large values of f (f \u2265 40) we\nsee large fluctuations, indicating the limit where our sampling breaks down. Otherwise we see large corrections to\nscaling, but they all are dominantly \u223c 1/N , i.e. analytic\ncorrections, and they have rather small influences on our\nfinal estimates of Af .\nThese estimates are given in Table 1 and plotted in\nFig. 7. We show indeed the ratios Af /A1 , to facilitate the\ncomparison with previous estimates. The best previous\nestimates are those of Zifferer [20] and are also given in\nTable 1. We see very good agreement, even if most of the\nvalues of [20] are outside our error bars. The data of Zifferer were obtained from simulations on the tetrahedral\nlattice, and they indicate that the ratios Af /A1 are indeed universal. In [22], stars with up to 80 arms were simulated off-lattice by means of molecular dynamics. But\nit seems that the stars with N = 100 were not equilibrated, at least for f = 1 (see Table 1 of [22]). Therefore\nwe list for comparison only the data for N = 50. They\nare systematically larger than our results and those of\n[20], and the discrepancy increases with f . This suggests\nthat even these simulations had not reached equilibrium.\n\n\f6\nlar, are able to produce very precise Monte Carlo data\nfor star polymers with many arms. Using the DombJoyce model on the simple cubic lattice, we combined\nthis with absence of leading corrections to scaling and\nwith the possibility to connect arbitrarily many arms to\na pointlike core. This allowed us to test conjectured scaling laws for the entropic critical exponents \u03b3f and for\nthe f -dependent swelling of single arms. In principle we\ncould have measured during these simulations also other\nobservables like monomer densities, star shapes, radii of\ngyration, etc.\n\n2.2\n\nAf / A1\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nf\n\nFIG. 7: Amplitude ratios Af /A1 plotted against f .\n\nThe most cited predictions for Af /A1 are from a\nheuristic blob model [9, 10].

There are also no good experimental results for these exponents, although they are fundamental for the entropy (and thus also for the free energy)\nof star polymers in good solvents. Our results show that\nthese predictions are qualitatively correct (\u03b3f is negative\nand diverges as \u2212f \u03b1 , but the exponent \u03b1 clearly disagrees\nwith the prediction.\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is in gross violation with our data. The fact that\nthis Daoud-Cotton model gives a too strong swelling with\nf is well known [20, 40]. Our data cannot be fitted by\na pure power law, but asymptotically (for f \u2192 \u221e) they\ntend roughly to Af /A1 \u2248 0.78 f 0.235 . Again we do not\nexpect this to be the true asymptotic behaviour, but it\nprovides at least a useful guide for extrapolations.\nRenormalization group (RG) calculations of star polymer sizes have been performed in [11, 12], but it was\nalready pointed out in [13, 14] that these have difficulties in describing the large-f behaviour. Using their own\nsimulations to fix some of the parameters in an improved\nRG calculation, Lue and Kiselev [13, 14] were able to\nfix these problems in the sense that their RG calculation described perfectly the behaviour of the penetration\nfunction [13, 14]. Unfortunately, they did not give predictions for Af , so we cannot make a detailed comparison\nwith our data. But we should point out that [13, 14]\nalso obtained much less swelling with f than predicted\nin Refs.[9, 11, 12].\n\nWe also disagree with the prediction of the DaoudCotton model for the sizes of star polymers, and indeed\nthe disagreement for the end-to-center distances is larger\nthan for \u03b3f . They increase with f much slower than predicted. But this finding is not entirely new, it had been\nobserved previously in Monte Carlo simulations [20, 40].\nOur data are compatible with these, but more precise\nand extending to larger values of f . Disagreement with\nthe Daoud-Cotton prediction for star polymer sizes was\nalso found in some experiments [41], but there are also\nrepeated claims in the literature [22, 42] that experiments\nare compatible with it. We have no good explanation for\nthe latter, except that the interpretation of experiments\nfor diluted solutions might be less easy than anticipated.\n\nWe have demonstrated that chains growth methods\nwith resampling, and the PERM algorithm in particu-\n\nWith slight modifications of the algorithm one can also\nstudy related problems like stars center-absorbed to surfaces [43], stars confined between two planar walls [44],\nheterostars [7, 40], interactions between two star polymers [13, 38, 45, 46], or star polymer - colloid interactions\n[47]. We expect that PERM will be more efficient than\nprevious algorithms (not the least because it gives immediately precise entropy estimates), in particular if applied\nto lattice models. PERM can also be applied off-lattice\n[31, 48], but its advantage is in general less pronounced\nthere. We hope to present simulations for some of these\nproblems in the near future.\n\n[1] G.S.
