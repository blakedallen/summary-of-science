These data encompass the\ntwo-, and three-telescope commissioning phases, as well as observations with the\nfull four-telescope array. 1ES 0806+524 is detected with a statistical significance\nof 6.3 standard deviations from 245 excess events. Little or no measurable variability on monthly time scales is found. The photon spectrum for the period\nNovember 2007 to April 2008 can be characterized by a power law with photon\nindex 3.6 \u00b1 1.0stat \u00b1 0.3sys between \u223c300 GeV and \u223c700 GeV. The integral flux\nabove 300 GeV is (2.2 \u00b1 0.5stat \u00b1 0.4sys ) \u00d7 10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121 which corresponds to\n1.8% of the Crab Nebula flux. Non-contemporaneous multiwavelength observations are combined with the VHE data to produce a broadband spectral energy\ndistribution that can be reasonably described using a synchrotron-self-Compton\nmodel.\nSubject headings: BL Lacertae objects: individual (1ES 0806+524)-gamma\nrays: observations-X-rays: galaxies-ultraviolet: galaxies\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN) are galactic cores with a luminosity that dominates the host\ngalaxy. These central engines are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes which\ndraw surrounding matter into an accretion disc. The unified model (Urry & Padovani 1995)\nof AGN implies that the observed emission from AGN is a strong function of the observation\nangle in relation to the relativistic jet, with the highest energy observed emission beamed\nalong the direction of the jet.\n28\n\nEuropean Southern Observatory, Karl-Schwarzchild-Strasse 2, 85748 Garching, Germany\n\n29\n\nKavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA\n\n30\n\nDepartment of Applied Physics and Instumentation, Cork Institute of Technology, Bishopstown, Cork,\nIreland\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n1ES 0806+524 was identified as a BL Lacertae object (Schachter et al. 1993) using radio\nobservations from the Green Bank 91-m telescope (Becker et al. 1991) and X-ray observations\nfrom the Einstein Slew Survey (Elvis et al. 1992). The redshift of the host galaxy is z=0.138\n(Bade et al. 1998). The blazar 1ES 0806+524 was suggested as a candidate VHE gammaray source based on the presence of both high-energy electrons and sufficient seed photons\n(Costamante & Ghisellini 2002). That work predicts an intrinsic flux in the VHE regime of\nFE>0.3 TeV = 1.36 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nVery high-energy gamma-ray observations of 1ES 0806+524 reported by the Whipple\nCollaboration (Horan et al. 2004; de la Calle P\u00e9rez et al. 2003) indicated flux upper limits\nof FE>0.3 TeV < 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 and FE>0.3 TeV < 16.8 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 from the 1996 and\n2000 observing seasons and FE>0.3 TeV < 1.47 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 from the 2000 to 2002 observing seasons. Observations reported by the HEGRA Collaboration (Aharonian et al. 2004)\nindicated an upper limit of FE>1.09 TeV < 43 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 based on hour of observations.\nObservations of 1ES 0806+524 in late 2006 and early 2007 with VERITAS (Cogan et al.\n2007a) yielded evidence for weak emission with a statistical significance of 2.5 standard deviations in 35 hours. The data reported in Cogan et al. (2007a) are combined with the data\nfrom the 2007/2008 observing season here.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and analysis\n\nVERITAS (Weekes et al. 2002) is an array of four 12-m diameter imaging Cherenkov\ntelescopes located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona (1268 m\na.s.l., 31o 40\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 N, 110o 57\u203207\u2032\u2032 W).\nObservations of 1ES 0806+524 were made between November 2006 and February 2007\nduring the construction phase of VERITAS and from November 2007 to April 2008 during\nthe full four-telescope operation. All observations were taken in wobble mode (Fomin et al.\n1994), where the target is offset from the center of the field of view by \u00b10.3\u25e6 or \u00b10.5\u25e6 .\nAfter quality selection to remove data suffering from poor weather or technical problems, a\ntotal of 65 hours of observations are available. These data comprise 5 hours with a T1/T2\nconfiguration, 25 hours with a T1/T2/T3 configuration, and 35 hours with a T1/T2/T3/T4\nconfiguration. These data were analyzed using the standard offline VERITAS data analysis\npackage VEGAS (Cogan et al. 2007b). Consistent results are obtained using independent\nanalysis packages.\nShower images of extensive air showers in each camera are gain-corrected and cleaned\n(Cogan et al. 2007c) before being parameterised using a moment analysis (Hillas 1985). Prior\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nto stereoscopic reconstruction, a pre-selection retaining images with size greater than 75\nphotoelectrons, with greater than 4 pixels surviving cleaning, and with a distance from the\ncenter of the field of view to the image centroid of less than 1.43\u25e6 is applied. Events where only\nimages from the two closest-spaced telescopes survive the pre-selection are rejected. Each\nshower is parameterised using mean-scaled width (MSW) and mean-scaled length (MSL)\n(Konopelko et al. 1995). Gamma-ray selection criteria of MSW < 1.16 and MSL < 1.36 are\nused to reject most of the background while retaining a large portion of the signal. These\nselection criteria were optimised assuming a source strength of 3% of the Crab Nebula flux.\nBackground estimation is performed using the reflected-region background model (Berge et al.\n2007). In this scheme, an integration region is placed around 1ES 0806+524, with background integration regions distributed around the field of view. The number of events in the\nintegration region is termed ON, the number of events in the background region is termed\nOFF, and the ratio of the integration areas is termed \u03b1. As the data comprise observations\nwith different absolute wobble offsets, a generalized version of equation 17 from Li & Ma\n(1983), as noted in Aharonian et al. (2004), is used to compute the statistical significance of\nthe excess.\nThe entire VERITAS dataset from 2006 through 2008 reveals the existence of veryhigh-energy gamma-ray emission from 1ES 0806+524 with a statistical significance of 6.3\nstandard deviations above an energy threshold of \u223c300 GeV. The total number of ON counts\nis 1543, the total number of OFF counts is 13311 and the effective ratio of the integration\nregions (accounting for the different wobble offsets) is \u03b1 = 0.0975, yielding an excess of 245\nevents.\nA distribution of the squared angular distance (referred to as \u03b82 ) between the position of\n1ES 0806+524 and the reconstructed shower direction is shown in Figure 1. The integration\nregion used in the reflected-region analysis is indicated by the vertical line situated at \u03b82 =\n2\n0.013\u25e6 . The scaled background counts are shown for comparison, and are computed using the\ncenters of the reflected regions as the reference points. The distribution of excess gamma-ray\ncounts is consistent with that given by a point source located at right ascension 8h 9m 59s \u00b1 9s\nand declination 52\u25e6 19\u2032 \u00b1 2\u2032 . There is an added combined systematic angular uncertainty\nof \u223c100\". This is consistent, within error, with the position of the radio source at right\nascension 8h 9m 49.2s and declination 52\u25e6 18\u2032 58\u2032\u2032 (Kovalev et al. 2007).\nOnly those data taken with four operating telescopes are used for a spectral analysis,\nowing to the superior energy resolution afforded. The subset of data, taken during the\n2007/2008 observing period, reveals a total of 176 ON events, 1334 OFF events with statistical significance of 4.4 \u03c3 using equation 17 from Li & Ma (1983), where \u03b1 = 0.09, yielding\nan excess of 55 events. The differential photon spectrum can be fit using a power law of\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe form dN/dE = F0 \u00d7 (E/400GeV)\u2212\u0393 where F0 = (6.8 \u00b1 1.7stat \u00b1 1.3sys ) \u00d7 10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121\nand \u0393 = 3.6 \u00b1 1.0stat \u00b1 0.3sys . The fit yields a \u03c72 /dof of 0.07/2, where dof is the number of\ndegrees of freedom. Upper limits for two spectral points above \u223c700 GeV are calculated at\nthe 90% confidence level according to Helene (1984).\nAbsorption on the infrared component of the extragalactic background light results in\nan attenuation of high-energy photons (Gould & Schr\u00e9der 1967). The absorption model\naccording to Franceschini et al. (2008) is used to calculate the deabsorbed spectrum. This\nis achieved by scaling each flux point according to Fint = Fobs e\u03c4 (E,z), where E is the energy\nat that flux point, z is the redshift and \u03c4 is a function describing the absorption model. A\npower law fit to the resultant flux points results in a spectral index of \u22122.8 \u00b1 0.5stat .\nThe integral light curve above 300 GeV is shown in Figure 3 with the data binned per\nmonth. A constant fit yields a \u03c72 /dof of 6.78/5 indicating little or no measurable variability.\n\n3.\n\nAnalysis of Swift UVOT and XRT Data\n\nFollowing the announcement of the discovery of 1ES 0806+524 by VERITAS in the\nvery-high energy gamma-ray regime (Swordy 2008a), 1ES 0806+524 was observed by Swift\n(Gehrels et al. 2004) in the ultraviolet to optical and X-ray energy bands using the UVOT\nand XRT between 2008 March 8 and 2008 March 12. Data reduction is carried out with\nthe HEAsoft 6.4 package. The Swift XRT data were taken in photon counting mode at a\nrate below 0.6 counts/s, so photon pileup is not evident. The XRTPIPELINE tool is used\nto calibrate and clean the XRT event files. Source and background counts are extracted\nfrom circular regions of radius 30 and 40 pixels, respectively. The 0.6 to 10 keV energy\nspectra are fit by a power law with fixed Galactic column density of N H = 4.4 * 1020 cm\u22122\n(Dickey & Lockman 1990). Marginal flux variability is seen from 2008 March 8 to 12, with\nthe photon index hardening from \u0393 = 2.67 \u00b1 0.08 to \u0393 = 2.53 \u00b1 0.07.\nSwift UVOT data is reduced with the UVOTSOURCE tool to extract counts, correct\nfor coincidence losses, apply background subtraction, and calculate the source flux. The\nstandard 5 arcsec radius source aperture is used, with a 20 arcsec background region. The\nsource fluxes are dereddened using the interstellar extinction curve in Fitzpatrick (1999).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Modeling\n\nNon-contemporaneous data from the Swift UVOT1 and XRT are combined with the\nVERITAS data and an archival optical data point (from the Tuorla 1m telescope2 ) to produce a broadband spectral energy distribution in a \u03bdF\u03bd representation as shown in Figure\n4. The Tuorla data were taken with an R-band filter and host-galaxy subtraction is applied.\nThe spectral energy distribution (SED) is modeled using the equilibrium version of the onezone jet radiation transfer code of B\u00f6ttcher & Chiang (2002), with parameters appropriate\nfor a pure synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. This model assumes a population of\nultrarelativistic nonthermal electrons (and positrons) injected into a spherical comoving volume (referred to as the blob). The injection spectrum is characterized by an injection power\nLinj (t) with an unbroken power-law distribution between energies \u03b31 and \u03b32 with index q.\nThe jet moves with relativistic speed \u03b2c and it is charaterized by Doppler factor D which is\ndependent on the line of sight. The injected particles suffer radiative losses via synchrotron\nemission and Compton upscattering of synchrotron photons.\nThe SSC model has been fitted to the data, with different parameters obtained for\nthe 2008 March 8 and 2008 March 12 data sets. For 2008 March 8, we obtain Linj (t) =\n1.9 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 with an injection spectrum described by \u03b31 = 1.77 \u00d7 104 , \u03b32 = 2 \u00d7 105 ,\nspectral index q = 3.1 and a magnetic field strength of 0.39 Gauss. The corresponding\nparameters for the 2008 March 12 dataset are 1.6 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 , \u03b31 = 1.6 \u00d7 104 , \u03b32 = 2 \u00d7 105 ,\ninjection spectral index q = 2.7 and magnetic field strength of 0.5 Gauss. The blob radius\nis 5 \u00d7 1015 cm in both cases. A Lorentz factor of \u0393 = 20 is used, with the simplifying\nassumption that the Doppler factor D is equal to the Lorentz factor. The synchrotron peak\nis located at \u223c8.3\u00d71015 Hz and the inverse-Compton peak is located at \u223c3.5\u00d71024 Hz. The\nsystem is within a factor \u223c2 of equipartition in both cases. Absorption on the extragalactic\nbackground light using the EBL scenario described by Franceschini et al. (2008) has been\naccounted for in the model.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nVERITAS has observed the blazar 1ES 0806+524 for a total 65 hours from November\n2006 to April 2008 resulting in the discovery of very-high-energy gamma rays with a statistical\nsignificance of 6.3 \u03c3. The differential energy spectrum between \u223c300 GeV and \u223c700 GeV\n1\n\nNote that the host galaxy contribution is not important in UV.\n\n2\n\nhttp://users.utu.fi/kani/1m/\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ncan be fitted by a relatively soft power law with index \u0393 = 3.6 \u00b1 1.0stat \u00b1 0.3sys . The\nintegral flux above 300 GeV is (2.2 \u00b1 0.5stat \u00b1 0.4sys ) \u00d7 10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121 which corresponds to\n(1.8 \u00b1 0.5)% of the Crab Nebula flux as measured by VERITAS above 300 GeV. Assuming\nabsorption on the infrared component of the extragalactic background light according to\nFranceschini et al. (2008), the intrinsic integral flux above 300 GeV is (4.4 \u00b10.6stat \u00b10.5sys ) \u00d7\n10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121 which is approximately one order of magnitude less than the flux predicted by\nCostamante & Ghisellini (2002). The broadband spectral energy distribution can be fitted\nusing a one-zone SSC model with standard parameters.\nObservations by the EGRET gamma-ray space telescope reveal gamma-ray emission\nfrom the region around 1ES 0806+524, however the large error box indicates that the emission could be associated with either B 0803+5126 (z=1.14) or 1ES 0806+524, with the\nformer being favored (Sowards-Emmerd et al. 2003). Observations of this region with the\nLarge Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope should resolve the source(s)\nof gamma-ray emission in this region.\nVERITAS is the most sensitive instrument of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere, and\nit is ideally suited to observations of extragalactic objects. This has been demonstrated by\nthe detection of three new BL Lac objects by VERITAS in 2008 (Swordy (2008a), Swordy\n(2008b), Acciari et al. (2008)).\nThis research is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S.\nNational Science Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, by NSERC in Canada, by Science\nFoundation Ireland and by PPARC in the UK.
