INTRODUCTION\n\nCygnus X-1 is the best established candidate for a stellar mass black-hole (BH) and one of the brightest X-ray\nsources in the sky (Bowyer et al. 1965). Located at a distance of 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 kpc, it is composed of a 21 \u00b1 8 M\u2299\nBH turning around an O9.7 Iab companion of 40 \u00b1 10 M\u2299\n(Zi\u00f3\u0142kowski 2005) in a circular orbit of 5.6 days and inclination between 25\u25e6 and 65\u25e6 (Gies & Bolton 1986). The\nX-ray source is thought to be powered mainly by accretion\nand displays the canonical high/soft and low/hard X-ray spectral states depending on the accretion rate (Esin et al. 1998).\nThe thermal soft component is produced by the accretion\ndisk close to the BH, whereas hard X-rays are thought to\nbe produced by inverse Compton scattering of soft photons\nby thermal electrons in a corona or at the base of a relativistic jet. The results from observations in the soft \u03b3ray range with COMPTEL (McConnell et al. 2002) and INTEGRAL (Cadolle Bel et al. 2006) strongly suggest the presence of a higher energy non-thermal component. In addition,\nfast episodes of flux variation by a factor between 3 and 30\nhave been detected at different time scales, ranging from milliseconds in the 3-30 keV band (Gierli\u0144ski & Zdziarski 2003)\n\n\fJ. Albert et al.\n\nto several hours in the 15-300 keV band (Golenetskii et al.\n2003). Radio emission stays at a rather stable level during the\nlow/hard state, except for rarely observed flares (Fender et al.\n2006), and appears to be quenched below a detectable level\nduring the high/soft state (Brocksopp et al. 1999). On the\nother hand, VLBA images have shown the presence of a onesided, elongated radio structure (15 mas length) during the\nhard state (Stirling et al. 2001), indicating the presence of a\nhighly collimated (opening angle < 2\u25e6 ) relativistic (v \u2265 0.6c)\njet. Romero, Kaufman Bernado & Mirabel (2002) have suggested that Cygnus X-1 is a microblazar, where the jet axis is\nroughly aligned with the line of sight. The interaction of the\noutflow from the jet with the interstellar medium appears to\nproduce a large-scale (\u223c 5 pc diameter), ring-like, radio emitting structure (Gallo et al. 2005), which implies that most of\nthe energy from the system is released by a radiatively inefficient relativistic jet.\nThree other binary systems have been detected so far in\nthe VHE domain, namely PSR B1259\u221263 (Aharonian et al.\n2005a), LS I+61 303 (Albert et al. 2006a) and LS 5039\n(Aharonian et al. 2005b). In PSR B1259\u221263 the TeV emission is thought to be produced by the interaction of the\nrelativistic wind from a young non-accreting pulsar with\nthat of the companion star. Recent results suggest that\nLS I +61 303 also contains a non-accreting neutron star\n(Dhawan, Mioduszewski & Rupen 2006), while the situation\nis not yet clear in the case of LS 5039. As of now, there is\nno experimental evidence of VHE emission from any galactic\nBHXB system.\nIn this letter we report on the \u2013to our knowledge\u2013 first\nresults of observations of Cygnus X-1 in the VHE regime,\nperformed with the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging\nCherenkov (MAGIC) telescope. Our results pose stringent\nupper limits to a steady VHE flux and include evidence of an\nintense, fast flaring episode occurring in coincidence with an\nX-ray flare. We briefly describe the observations and data\nanalysis, derive the spatial and spectral features of the observed excess, and discuss the obtained results.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS\n\nThe BHXB Cygnus X-1 was observed with MAGIC for\na total of 46.2 hours between June and November 2006.\nMAGIC is an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope\n(IACT) located at La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain), at\n28.8\u25e6N, 17.8\u25e6W, 2200 m.a.s.l. The telescope's sensitivity is\n\u223c 2% of the Crab nebula flux in 50 hours of observations.\nThe angular resolution is \u223c 0.1\u25e6 , and the energy resolution\nabove 150 GeV is about 20%. MAGIC can provide \u03b3-ray\nsource localization in the sky with a precision of \u223c 2\u2032 and is\nable to observe under moderate moonlight or twilight conditions (Albert et al. 2007). At La Palma, Cygnus X-1 culminates at a zenith angle of 5\u25e6 and the observations were carried\nout at zenith angles between 5\u25e6 and 35\u25e6 . The brightest object\nin the Cygnus X-1 field of view is the 3.89 magnitude, K0\nspectral-type star \u03b7 Cygni, located 26\u2032 away from Cygnus X1. The observations were carried out in the false-source track\n(wobble) mode (Fomin et al. 1994), with two directions at 24\u2032\ndistance and opposite sides of the source direction. This technique allows for a reliable estimation of the background with\nno need of extra observation time. One of the tracked directions corresponds roughly to that of \u03b7 Cygni, which reduces\nthe effect of the star in the data analysis.\nData corresponding to 46.2 hours from 26 nights of observation were analyzed using the standard MAGIC calibra-\n\nTABLE 1\nC YGNUS X-1 OBSERVATION LOGa\nMJD\n[days]\n\nT\n[min]\n\nNexcess\n[evts]\n\nS\n[\u03c3]\n\nPost\n[\u03c3]\n\nU.L.\n[evts (% CU)]\n\n53942.051\n61.1\n3.6\u00b1 4.8\n0.8 < 0.1\n15.02(11.1)\n53964.887 105.6\n4.8\u00b1 6.9\n0.7 < 0.1\n21.49(9.2)\n53965.895 195.3 \u221213.2\u00b1 10.1 \u22121.3 < 0.1\n8.74(2.0)\n53966.934 124.8\n9.4\u00b1 9.5\n1.0 < 0.1\n33.07(11.9)\n53967.992\n48.5\n\u22129.0\u00b1 4.7 \u22121.7 < 0.1\n1.57(1.5)\n53968.883 237.5\n\u22124.4\u00b1 11.6 \u22120.4 < 0.1\n22.76(4.3)\n53994.953\n53.6\n\u22124.0\u00b1 4.9 \u22120.8 < 0.1\n6.84(5.8)\n53995.961\n58.1\n\u22122.8\u00b1 4.6 \u22120.6 < 0.1\n7.76(6.0)\n53996.855 176.2\n1.6\u00b1 9.1\n0.2 < 0.1\n22.15(5.7)\n53997.883 132.7\n5.2\u00b1 7.6\n0.7 < 0.1\n22.95(7.8)\n54000.852 165.2\n11.4\u00b1 9.7\n1.2 < 0.1\n35.41(9.7)\n54002.875 154.4\n36.8\u00b1 10.4\n4.0\n3.2\n***\n54003.859 166.9\n\u22127.0\u00b1 9.1 \u22120.8 < 0.1\n13.35(3.6)\n54004.891 123.3\n\u22126.0\u00b1 7.9 \u22120.7 < 0.1\n11.33(4.1)\n54005.914\n87.9\n\u22122.2\u00b1 6.3 \u22120.3 < 0.1\n11.88(6.1)\n54006.938\n28.0\n5.4\u00b1 4.1\n1.4 < 0.1\n15.26(24.6)\n54020.891\n65.5\n\u22128.6\u00b1 5.9 \u22121.4 < 0.1\n4.27(2.9)\n54021.887\n68.6\n\u22126.2\u00b1 5.7 \u22121.0 < 0.1\n6.30(4.1)\n54022.887\n58.1\n1.6\u00b1 5.9\n0.3 < 0.1\n14.55(11.3)\n54028.863\n68.6\n3.4\u00b1 5.9\n0.6 < 0.1\n18.28(12.0)\n54029.895\n33.5\n3.4\u00b1 5.1\n0.7 < 0.1\n15.93(21.5)\n54030.863\n19.6\n\u22121.8\u00b1 3.0 \u22120.6 < 0.1\n5.41(12.5)\n54048.824\n47.2\n1.6\u00b1 5.7\n0.3 < 0.1\n14.99(14.3)\n54049.824\n47.9\n\u22126.0\u00b1 5.4 \u22121.1 < 0.1\n6.09(5.7)\n54056.820\n27.1\n\u22125.2\u00b1 3.8 \u22121.3 < 0.1\n3.55(5.9)\n54057.820\n21.5\n1.2\u00b1 2.6\n0.5 < 0.1\n7.96(16.7)\na From left to right: Modified Julian Date of the beginning of the observation, total observation EOT, number of excess events, statistical significance of the excess, equivalent (post-trial) significance for 26 independent samples and signal upper limit for the different observation nights.\nA cut SIZE>200 photo-electrons (E\u03b3 > 150 GeV) has been applied.\nUpper limits (Rolke, L\u00f3pez & Conrad 2005) are 95% confidence level\n(CL) and are quoted in number of events and in units of the \u03b3-ray flux\nmeasured for the Crab nebula, assuming the Crab nebula spectral slope\n(\u03b1 = \u22122.6).\nFlux (dN/dE dA dt) [cm-2 s-1 TeV-1]\n\n2\n\n10-8\n\nMAGIC\n10-9\n\nCrab Nebula\nCyg X-1 2006-09-24\nCyg X-1 steady\n\n10-10\n10-11\n10-12\n10-13\n10-14\n\n-3.2\u00b10.6\ndN\n= (2.3\u00b10.6)\u00d710-12 E\n[cm-2 s-1 TeV-1]\ndA dt dE\n1 TeV\n\n-15\n\n10\n\n102\n\n103\n\nEnergy [GeV]\n\nF IG . 1.- Differential energy spectrum from Cygnus X-1 corresponding\nto 78.9 minutes EOT between MJD 54002.928 and 54002.987 (2006-09-24).\nAlso shown are the Crab nebula spectrum and the best fit of a power-law to\nthe data and the 95% confidence level upper limits to the steady \u03b3-ray flux\n(Rolke, L\u00f3pez & Conrad 2005).\n\ntion and analysis software (Albert et al. 2006b; Gaug et al.\n2005).

The residual background was evaluated from 5 circular\ncontrol regions, located symmetrically to the source position\nwith respect to the camera center. For daily searches we increase the sample for background estimation by adding control regions corresponding to close days, obtaining on average\n22 times higher statistics than in the on-source region.\nA search for steady \u03b3-ray signals was performed for the entire recorded data sample, yielding no significant excess. This\nallows us to establish the first upper limits to the VHE \u03b3-ray\nsteady flux of Cygnus X-1 in the range between 150 GeV and\n3 TeV (see Figure 1), of the order of 1\u20135% of the Crab nebula\nflux. Given the time scale of the variability of Cygnus X-1 at\nother energy bands, \u03b3-ray signals are searched for also on a\n\n3\n\ndaily basis. The results are shown in Table 1. We obtain results compatible with background fluctuations at 99% CL for\nall the searched samples except for MJD=54002.875 (200609-24). We derive upper limits to the integral flux above 150\nGeV between 2 and 25% of the Crab nebula flux (depending basically on the observation time) for all samples compatible with background fluctuations. The data from 200609-24 were further subdivided into two halves to search for\nfast varying signals, obtaining 0.5\u03c3 and 4.9\u03c3 effects for the\nfirst (75.5 minutes EOT starting at MJD 54002.875) and second (78.9 minutes EOT starting at MJD 54002.928) samples,\nrespectively. The post-trial probability is conservatively estimated by assuming 52 trials (2 per observation night) and corresponds to a significance of 4.1\u03c3. The sample corresponding\nto MJD 54002.928 was further subdivided into halves, obtaining 3.2\u03c3 and 3.5\u03c3 excesses in each. At this point we stopped\nthe data split process.\nThe distribution of \u03b82 for signal and background events corresponding to the 78.9 minutes EOT sample starting at MJD\n54002.928 is shown in Figure 2. The excess is consistent\nwith a point like source located at the position of Cygnus X-1.\nThe map of excess events around the source is shown in Figure 3. A Gaussian fit yields the location: \u03b1 = 19h 58m 17s ,\n\u03b4 = 35\u25e6 12\u2032 8\u2032\u2032 with statistical and systematic uncertainties\n1.5\u2032 and 2\u2032 , respectively, compatible within errors with the\nposition of Cygnus X-1 and excluding the jet-powered radio nebula at a distance of \u223c 8\u2032 . The energy spectrum is\nshown in Figure 1. It is well fitted (\u03c72 /n.d.f = 0.5) by\nthe following power law: dN/(dA dt dE) = (2.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7\n10\u221212 (E/1 TeV)\u22123.2\u00b10.6 cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 where the quoted\nerrors are statistical only. We estimate the systematic uncertainty to be 35% on the overall flux normalization and 0.2 in\nthe determination of the spectral index.\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nThe excess from the direction of Cygnus X-1 occurred simultaneously with a hard X-ray flare detected by INTEGRAL\n(\u223c1.5 Crab between 20\u201340 keV and \u223c1.8 Crab between 40\u2013\n80 keV) (T\u00fcrler et al. 2006), Swift/BAT (\u223c1.8 Crab between\n15 and 50 keV) and RXTE/ASM (\u223c0.6 Crab between 1.5 and\n12 keV). Figure 4 shows the correlation between MAGIC,\nSwift/BAT and RXTE/ASM light-curves. The TeV excess was\nobserved at the rising edge of the first hard X-ray peak, 1\u2013\n2 hours before its maximum, while there is no clear change\nin soft X-rays. Additionally, the MAGIC non-detection during the following night (yielding a 95% CL upper limit corresponding to a flux \u223c 5 times lower than the one observed in\nthe second half of 2006-09-24) occurred during the decay of\nthe second hard X-ray peak. This phenomenology leads us to\nthink that, during the 2006-09-24 night, soft and hard X-rays\nare produced in different regions. Furthermore, hard X-rays\nand VHE \u03b3-rays could be produced at regions linked by the\ncollimated jet, e.g. the X-rays at the jet base and \u03b3-rays at an\ninteraction region between the jet and the stellar wind. These\nprocesses would have different physical timescales, thus producing a shift in time between the TeV and X-ray peaks. Note\nthat the distance from the compact object to the TeV production region is constrained below 2\u2032 by MAGIC observations\nand therefore it is unrelated with the nearby radio emitting\nring-like structure (Gallo et al. 2005). A jet scenario is, however, not devoid of constraints either. The observed TeV excess took place at phase 0.91, being 1 the moment when the\nBH is behind the massive star. At this phase, MAGIC observations are available only for the night 2006-09-24, which\n\n\fJ.

The left panels show the whole time\nspanned by MAGIC observations. The vertical, dotted blue lines delimit the\nrange zoomed in the right panels. The vertical red line marks the time of the\nMAGIC signal.\n\nprecludes any possible analysis of a putative periodicity feature of the TeV emission. If the TeV emission were produced in the jet well within the binary system, the photonphoton absorption in the stellar photon field would be dramatic, yielding a TeV detection very unlikely. For instance,\nBednarek & Giovannelli (2007) computed the opacity to pair\nproduction for different injection distances from the center of\nthe massive star and angles of propagation, finding that photons propagating through the intense stellar field towards the\nobserver would find in their way opacities of about 10 at 1\nTeV. Admittedly, inclination of the orbit and angle of propagation to the observer can change these numbers, but not the\nfact that MAGIC observes the excess at the position where\nthe expected opacity is highest. Therefore, even without an\nexplanation for a TeV flare, we must consider that the emission could have been originated far from the compact object.\nInteractions of the jet with the stellar wind may lead to such a\nsituation.\nIn summary, for the first time we have found experimental evidence of VHE emission produced by a Galactic stellarmass BH. It is also the first evidence of VHE gamma-rays\nproduced at an accreting binary system. Our results show\nthat a possible steady VHE flux is below the present IACT's\nsensitivity and tight upper limits have been derived. On the\nother hand, we have found evidence for an intense flaring\nepisode during the inferior conjunction of the optical star, of\ntime scale shorter than 1 day and rising time of about 1 hour,\ncorrelated with a hard X-ray flare observed by Swift and INTEGRAL. These results point to the existence of a whole new\nphenomenology in the young field of VHE astrophysics of binary systems to be explored by present and future IACT's.\nWe thank the IAC for the excellent working conditions at\nthe Observatory del Roque los Muchachos in La Palma.
