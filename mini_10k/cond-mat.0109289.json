Recent theory [1\u20133] by Bouchaud et al. implies that the\ninternal structure of a heap (and therefore the force pathway) is a strong\nfunction of the construction history. In general, it is difficult to obtain information that could test this idea from 3D granular experiments except at\nboundaries. However, 2D systems, such as those used here, can yield information on forces and particle arrangements in the interior of a sample. We\nobtain position and force information through the use of photoelastic particles. These experiments show that the history of the heap formation has a\ndramatic effect on the arrangement of particles (texture) and a weaker but\nclear effect on the forces within the sample. Specifically, heaps prepared by\npouring from a point source show strong anisotropy in the contact angle distribution. Depending on additional details, they show a stress dip near the\ncenter. Heaps formed from a broad source show relatively little contact angle\nanisotropy and no indication of a stress dip.\nPACS numbers: 46.10.+z, 47.20.-k\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fGranular materials are of great interest for their technical relevance and for the host of\nmodeling challenges that they present [4]. Transporting and processing agricultural grains,\ncoal, and pharmaceutical powders represent only a few applications. Avalanches and mudslides are important natural phenomena that involve granular materials. Our understanding\nof granular flow, mixing, and even static behavior is still a open subject. In this work, we\nfocus on the last of these.\nStatic or slowly evolving granular systems are dominated by stress chains, long filamentary structures corresponding to the paths along which the majority of the force is carried\n[5]. In the photoelastic image of Fig. 1b, the bright disks are part of the force chains in a\n2D realization of a sandpile. The formation of these chains plays an important role in the\nfinal static state of a granular system. One reason for this history dependence is that the\nsolid-on-solid (SoS) friction between individual particles is typically indeterminate. That is,\nunder static conditions, the tangential frictional force at a contact, FT , can be anywhere in\nthe range |FT | \u2264 \u03bc|FN |, where \u03bc is the ordinary SoS friction coefficient and FN is the normal\ncontact force. For collections of stiff frictional grains, it is not always possible to determine\nthe forces at the contacts solely from the positions of the grains [6].\nRecently, several authors have proposed/discussed new continuum models for stresses\nwithin sand piles, including the Oriented Stress Linearity (OSL) model [3], which is predicated on a picture of how force chains are frozen into a granular system during its formation,\nthus creating inherent textures. This model was created in particular to better understand\nreported stress minima [7,8] under the center of some sand piles. There are other models for\ngranular statics [10\u201312], some of which also can predict a stress dip, including 'Incipient Failure Everywhere' (IFE) which assumes that the heap is everywhere at the point of Coulomb\nfailure and elasto-plasticity models. The stress dip has also been studied via discrete element models [15,16] (DEM) modeling techniques, including Molecular Dynamics (MD) and\nContact Dynamics [17] (CD). In MD models, a stress dip was found [15,16] depending on\nconstruction history, or in one case [16], if strong segregation occurred for piles formed from\na bidisperse collection of particles. CD calculations [17] predict anisotropy in the contact\nangles between neighboring particles that reflects the construction of the heap.\nThe existence of force minima under the base of real sandpiles [7\u20139,11,14] has been equally\ndebated [11]. Considerable care must be taken with experiments because perturbations, such\nas small deflections of the base surface, may significantly affect the measured profile. Recent\nmeasurements [14] on 3D conical piles that had minimal deflections of the base, showed a\nclear dip when the material was poured on the pile from a localized source, and no dip when\nthe pile was created by pouring from an extended source. Additional experiments [14] on\nlong 3D heaps (mountain chain shape) showed similar but weaker force sensitivity to how\nthe heap was formed.\nHere, we present measurements of contact angle and force distributions for 2D heaps\nprepared by pouring particles from a) a fixed height point-like source, b) a slowly moving\npoint source and c) an extended source. There is a dramatically different arrangement of\ncontact angles for the point vs. extended sources, even though the heap angles for the\ntwo techniques are essentially indistinguishable. There is also a clear difference in the force\nprofiles for the various preparation methods. For the fixed height localized source, the\ndistribution shows a clear minimum in the force at the heap center. For the other two\nmethods, the force distribution shows a broad maximum at the center, and possibly other\n2\n\n\fstructure on a finer scale.\nThe experiments were carried out with disks made from a photoelastic (birefringent\nunder stress) material [18]. The sample was a mixture of two disk sizes, one with diameter\n= 0.9 cm (\u223c 500 disks) and the other with diameter = 0.7cm (\u223c 2500 disks). The disks\nwere confined between two Plexiglas sheets, spaced slightly wider than the thickness (0.6\ncm) of the disks (The flat sides of the disks were parallel to the Plexiglas). The surfaces of\nthe parallel sheets were lubricated with a fine powder and typically oriented no more than\n3o from vertical to minimize friction between the sheets and the disks. The heap size was\n\u223c 130 cm at the base, and \u223c 30 cm high. We built heaps by the three different pouring\ntechniques, two local and one extended, as sketched in Fig. 1a. For the local source, the\ndisks were held in hollow Plexiglas insert between the two confining Plexiglas sheets. The\ninsert had an opening \u223c 7 grain diameters wide, small enough to be point-like, but wide\nenough that flow-stopping arches rarely formed. In the fixed height version of the local\nsource, the filled insert was placed at a fixed height, 57 cm, above the base. A stopper\nwas then removed from the insert opening, and the disks flowed out. In the slowly moving\nversion of the point source, we gradually raised the insert, creating a steady slow flow of\ndisks onto the peak of the emerging pile. The extended source also consisted of an insert, but\nthe central portion contained strips of either cardboard or Plexiglas. When the insert was\nlifted, it produced a steady rain of particles. As the heap formed, some of the particles then\navalanched off, and the final heap profile was not perceptibly different from those formed\nby the point-source method. In all cases, we imaged the final state of the system with\nvideo (640 \u00d7 480 pixels). In order to obtain high resolution, we obtained two sets of three\noverlapping images that covered the central region of the heap, \u223c 110 grain diameters wide.\nOne set of images was obtained with the system placed in a circular polarimeter [19] and\none without the polarimeter. In obtaining the various sets of images, the particles were left\nundisturbed for a given realization. The images with polarimeter yielded force information\nusing a novel application of photoelasticity described elsewhere [20] and the other yielded\nthe disk positions. We analyzed the images without the polarimeter to obtain the particle\ncenters, and hence, the contact angles. A given production of a heap showed large variations\nin the spatial structure of contacts and stress chain network. In order to obtain a reasonable\nstatistical average, we carried out 50 realizations of each heap preparation method.\nIn order to provide a simple measure of the contact orientation, we evaluated the average\nangular distribution of contacts, \u03c1(\u03b8), for the left and right sides (about the vertical center\nline) separately. The orientation of the particle contacts was dramatically different for the\nvarious preparation methods. We consider a contact to exist if the distance between the\ncenters of two partciles is within 4% of R1 + R2 , where Ri are the radii of the two particles.\nThus, some of the contacts may not be force-bearing. We only consider data for the left half\nof the heaps, since similar distributions result for the right side with an appropriate mirror\nreflection. In Fig. 2a, we contrast the distributions for the fixed height point source (FHPS),\nslowly moving point source (SMPS) and the extended sources (ES). For both the localizedsource procedures, there is strong anisotropy, and a clear preferred set of orientations. By\ncontrast, for the extended source procedure, the contacts are much closer to having an\nisotropic orientation of contacts.\nWe have also analyzed the contacts for only those disks that lie on a stress chain, i.e.\nthe distributions of neighbors of disks that experience a force exceeding the mean. These\n3\n\n\fconstitute \u223c 1/3 of the disks. We show the corresponding \u03c1(\u03b8) for the stress chain disks\nin Fig. 2b again only for the left half of the heap. In all cases, these large-force-carrying\ndisks have contact angle distributions that break the roughly six-fold symmetry present in\nthe distributions for all disks. This corresponds to stress chains that are inclined at angles\n0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2, i.e. in such a way as to support the heap. This compares very well with the\nCD calculations of Moreau [17].\nThe force profiles are affected by preparation history, but not as dramatically as the\ncontact angles. In Fig. 3, we show the force (averaged over 50 samples) as a function of\nhorizontal distance for various heights from the bottom of the heap, measured in small\nparticle diameters. The fixed-height local source method clearly yields a force minimum in\nthe center of the heap. The slowly lifted point source does not show a convincing dip, at\nleast within the scatter of the data. Similarly, the extended source method shows no dip.\nA final consideration is particle segregation, since significant segregation might lead to a\npressure dip [16]. In our experiments, we did not observe the strong segregation assumed in\nDEM calculations [16]. This point is documented in Fig. 4, where we compare experimental\ndistribution data (points) and calculated random distributions (lines) for the probability\nP (n ) of finding nl large particles next to any given particle. We estimate P (nl ) as P (nl ) =\nP6 l\nn=2 \u03b1n Pn,nl , where Pn,nl is the binomial distribution for a total of n = ns + nl contacts (ns\nthe total number of contacts with small particles) and where \u03b1n is fraction of particles in the\nsample with coordination number n. We determine the \u03b1n separately for each construction\ntechnique, hence the different lines in Fig. 4. There is no indication of significant segregation,\nwhich may be because the particles remain in a relatively dense state which limits the\nfreedom of particles to segregate.\nTo conclude, these experiments show clearly, and for the first time to our knowledge, that\ndifferent methods of heap preparation lead to dramatically different distributions of contact\nangles, hence, the texture, for physical granular systems. Knowledge of this texture is then\ncrucial for predicting static granular states. Although we do not determine information on\nthe vector forces at frictional contacts, it is important to emphasize that the most important\ndifference between the various filling techniques is the amount of disorder in the contact\norientations. This does not seem to depend on segregation effects.\nAcknowledgments The work was supported by the National Science Foundation under\nGrant DMR-9802602, and DMS-9803305, and by NASA under Grant NAG3-2372.\n\n4\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] J.-P Bouchaud, M.E.
