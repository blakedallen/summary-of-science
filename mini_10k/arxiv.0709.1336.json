The results show hot diffuse gas and low mass X-ray binaries (LMXB), many of which are associated with globular clusters\n(Sarazin et al 2001; Kim et al 2004a; Fabbiano & White 2003).\nThe hot gas has a temperature of 107 K and is not expected to\nsurvive in the cores of rich clusters of galaxies, where it should\nbe rapidly depleted by stripping and/or conduction (Gunn & Gott\n1972). However, small confined regions, of radius a few kpc, do\nsurvive in some early-type galaxies near the centres of rich clusters, as discovered in Chandra observations of the Coma cluster by\nVikhlinin et al (2001). Yamasaki et al (2002) later found two small\ngalaxy coronae in the centre of the A1060 cluster. Sun et al (2005a)\nand Sun et al (2005b) found four such X-ray minicoronae in A1367\nand one in the Perseus cluster, respectively, and Fujita, Sarazin &\nSivakoff (2006) found one in A2670. A systematic search for Xray mini-haloes in 157 early-type galaxies and 22 late-type galaxies in 25 hot, rich nearby clusters by Sun et al (2007) yielded many\nmore examples. From all these observations the authors have concluded that the diffuse hot coronae are stripped from the galaxies\nin the cores of rich clusters of galaxies, but mini-haloes remain at\nthe centres of some galaxies. Such mini haloes have typical sizes\nof 1-3 kpc, gas densities of 0.1 cm\u22123 or more and temperatures of\nabout 107 K.\nOther studies include Finoguenov et al (2004) who measured\nthe X-ray luminosity function of galaxies in the Coma cluster using\nXMM-Newton, and Finoguenov & Miniati (2004) who studied the\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:sumita@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\u2020 E-mail:jss@ast.cam.ac.uk\nc 0000 RAS\n\nimpact of high pressure cluster environment on the X-ray luminosity of Coma galaxies. Chandra X-ray observations of galaxies in an\noff-center region of the Coma cluster were done by Hornschemeier\net al (2006) to explore the X-ray properties and luminosity function\nof normal galaxies. They detected 13 galaxies. The X-ray activity\nis suppressed with respect to that of the field, indicating a lower\nlevel of X-ray emission for a given stellar mass.\nSome nuclei of nearby early-type galaxies are active but often\nat a level well below that expected from Bondi accretion of the hot\ncoronal gas (Fabian & Canizares 1988; Di Matteo et al 2000, 2001,\n2003; Pellegrini 2005). There are two possible explanations for the\nlow luminosities of nearby black holes: (1) any accretion proceeds\nat extremely low rates or (2) the accretion occurs at low radiative\nefficiencies as predicted, for example, by advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) models (e.g., Rees et al 1982; Narayan & Yi\n1995; Abramowicz et al 1995) and by jet models (e.g. Allen et al\n2006).\nHere we study the X-ray point sources coincident with member galaxies in the Perseus cluster using a very deep, 900 ks, Chandra image. The Perseus cluster is the brightest cluster in the Sky in\nX-rays, which makes looking for faint or diffuse emission difficult,\nparticularly in the core where our observations are best. In this paper we have looked at X-ray point sources coincident with bright\ngalaxies. We are interested here in the unresolved point sources\nwith power-law spectra, coincident with the galactic nuclei, in order to assess the level of nuclear activity. Sun et al (2007) have\npreviously used the same Chandra image of the Perseus cluster,\nand Chandra images of several other clusters, to explore the incidence and general properties of mini-haloes in cluster galaxies.\nMartini et al (2006) found that 5 per cent of the galaxies brighter\nthan MB < \u221220 in rich clusters are active, with X-ray luminosity\nLX > 1041 erg s\u22121 . This is 5 times more than found in optical spec-\n\n\f2\n\nS. Santra, J. S. Sanders & A. C. Fabian\n\nTable 1. Point sources obtained from the Chandra data which haven an optical counterpart.

Our results are consistent\nwith all galaxies above that optical magnitude limit having detected\ncentral X-ray sources, albeit at lower luminosities.\nThis paper is organised as follows: In Section 2 we describe\nthe data preparation, source detection and the X-ray spectral analysis. We compare the X-ray properties with the K band luminosity,\nUV AB magnitude, radio and black hole mass in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss our results and summarise them in Section 5.\n\n2 DATA ANALYSIS\n2.1 Observations\nThe 13 Chandra observations analysed here are detailed in Fabian\net al (2006). Each observation used the ACIS-S3 detector as the\naimpoint. The total maximum effective exposure time was 890\nks, after flares were removed. The level 2 event files were reprocessed with ACIS PROCESS EVENTS using the acisD2000-0129gain ctiN0003.fits gain file, and reprojected to match the coordinate system of the 04952 observation.\nThe regions of the sky with the highest effective Chandra exposure time are shown in Fig. 1. The off-axis effective exposure\ndecreases away from the centre of the ACIS-S3 CCD (which is the\nSW part of the right region, with a total exposure time of 890 ks).\nIn the NE and NW part of the right chip the exposure times are\n75 per cent and 50 per cent of the maximum respectively. The exposure time declines to 13 per cent of the maximum in the region\nindicated by source 13.\n2.2 X-ray source detection\nWe found 49 X-ray sources by eye in the total Chandra 0.3-7 keV\nimage. Of those sources, 13 have optical counterparts. The positions of these 13 sources and the nearest galaxy are listed in Table 1.\nThe sources are split into six close to the central galaxy (detected on\nthe central CCD) and seven further away (detected by other CCDs).\nThe remaining 36 sources without optical counterparts are shown\nin Table 2. We exclude these sources from the remainder of our\nanalysis.\nWe detected X-ray sources for all the galaxies brighter than\n\nFigure 2. 0.3\u20131.2 keV X-ray image of PGC 12443 showing drop in surface brightness due to absorption (left) compared with SDSS I-band image\n(right). The images measure 1 arcmin vertically.\n\nMB < \u221218. In this deep observation one might expect to detect\ngalaxies fainter than MB > \u221218, but the diffuse cluster emission\nmakes the background too high for such work.\nThe red Digitized Sky Survey (DSS2) was first used to identify\npossible optical counterparts for the X-ray sources. We then examined archival images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nand the catalogue of Perseus cluster galaxies by Brunzendorf &\nMeusinger (1999). Fig. 1 shows the SDSS I band image, indicating the detected X-ray sources with optical counterparts. They\nare all listed as early-type galaxies in the work of Brunzendorf &\nMeusinger (1999). We do not detect a three-armed spiral galaxy\n(UGC 2665, listed in Brunzendorf & Meusinger 1999), which lies\nbetween sources 7 and 9 (Fig. 1). This morphology excludes it being an early-type galaxy. Moreover, the velocity of this galaxy is\n2800 km s\u22121 higher than for the Perseus cluster core, so it is likely\nan outlier.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the X-ray contours for each of the detected\nsources (from a 0.3\u20137 keV image), overlaid on optical images of\nthe galaxies from SDSS. The first six sources are nearer to NGC\n1275 than the others. It is seen that in each of these cases the contours coincide with the nucleus of the galaxy, so the X-ray sources\nmatch the optical sources. They are also consistent with being point\nsources. The remaining seven sources are further from the central\ngalaxy. Some of these distant sources appear off-centred with respect to the optical galaxy centres. However, the offsets for these\nweak sources are only about 2 arcsec, similar to the offsets obtained\nfor Chandra off-axis sources by Kim et al (2004b). They are mainly\ndue to the off-axis point spread function (PSF) having an complex\nextended shape. The count rate and distance of the galaxies from\nthe central galaxy are given in Table 3.\nOne galaxy is seen in absorption (Fig. 2). This is listed as 284\nor PGC 12443 in the Table of Brunzendorf & Meusinger (1999). It\nlies midway between galaxies 4 and 5 in Fig. 1 and is centred at\n03h 19m 55.6s , +41\u25e6 31\u2032 23\u2032\u2032 and is listed as an elliptical galaxy 1.9\nmagnitudes fainter than NGC 1278. A spectral fit shows that the\nabsorption corresponds to an intrinsic column density of \u223c 3 \u00b1 1 \u00d7\n1020 cm\u22122 .\n2.3 X-ray spectral analysis\nWe extracted and modeled the X-ray spectra of those sources identified as Perseus core galaxies. For those sources on the central\nCCD, we used an extraction region of 3 arcsec. This increased to\n5-10 arcsec on the other chips. Spectra for each source were extracted from each of the separate observations and added together.\nThe local backgrounds were extracted from annuli with outer radii\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fAGN in the Perseus cluster\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

Response matrix files (RMF) and ancillary response\nfiles (ARF) were created for each of the sources by averaging the\nRMFs and ARFs from the individual observations (created using\nMKACISRMF and MKWARF).\nThe spectral fitting was performed using XSPEC v11.3.2. The\nspectra were grouped to have a minimum of 20 counts in each spectral bin before background subtraction in order to use the \u03c7 2 statistic. Model fitting was carried out in the 0.5 \u2212 7.0 keV band.\nEach X-ray spectrum was fitted by a power-law with possible intrinsic absorption and then, separately, by a MEKAL thermal spectrum. Most were best fitted by the power-law spectrum.\nWe let the power-law slope (\u0393) and the absorbing column density\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n(NH ) vary freely. In some cases the column density was less than\n1.3 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (the galactic absorption value) which was unphysical, so we fixed it at this minimum. The photon indexes of sources\n5, 8 and 9 were fixed at 2.0. In the cases where a single component\npower-law did not give a satisfactory fit, a MEKAL component with\na temperature fixed at 0.6 keV was added to improve the fit. We assume that this is a mini-halo component, although it is not spatially\nresolved.\n\nThe results of the spectral fitting of all the galaxies are given\nin Table 3. The values of NH and \u0393 vary between (1.3 \u2212 3.7) \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 and (2.0 \u2212 3.77) respectively. The values of column\ndensity was fixed at the minimum for sources 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11,\n\n\f4\n\nS. Santra, J. S. Sanders & A. C. Fabian\n\nFigure 3.

The \u0393 values are much steeper than for LMXB (Irwin,\nAthey & Bregman 2003).\nA typical spectral fit (for source 3) is shown in Fig. 4. The\nspectrum was fitted using an absorbed power-law and MEKAL\nmodel.\nIn Table 4, the 0.5 \u2212 7.0 keV flux and the absorption corrected\nluminosities of the individual sources based on the best-fitting absorbed power-law model, and in some cases MEKAL +absorbed\n\npower-law model, are presented. Luminosities were determined\nassuming a redshift 0.018 and cosmological model with H0 =\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The distances of all of these galaxies are assumed to be the same as that of NGC 1275, as they are in the\nsame cluster (Brunzendorf & Meusinger 1999). The uncertainties\non the X-ray luminosities were determined by generating a Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain using the built-in XSPEC functionality. After the chain had converged, we calculated the luminosity (with-\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fAGN in the Perseus cluster\n\n5\n\nLX (1040 erg s-1)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n1\nFigure 4.

The quoted\nluminosity is the median luminosity from the chain, and the uncertainties were calculated using the 15.85 and 84.15 percentiles.\nThe rest-frame 0.5 \u2212 2 keV luminosities of thermal minihaloes of\nPerseus core galaxies from Sun et al (2007) are also given in Table 4. These are the total (power-law+MEKAL ) luminosities. Sun\net al (2007) give no data for sources 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and found\nonly two minihalo objects. We found two more. The absolute total B band magnitudes of the galaxies are also shown in Table 4,\ncalculated using the luminosity distance and the total B band flux\ndensity from NED. There are no reported B band fluxes for sources\n5, 6, 11, 12, 13.\nAs the first 200 ks of the observations occurred around 2 yr\nbefore the remainder, we investigated whether the detected sources\nwere time variable. We determined the X-ray flux of the sources\nfor the two epochs of observation and found the fluxes were the\nsame within the uncertainties. Therefore no significant variability\nwas found.\n\n3 PROPERTIES OF THE EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES\nWe now make a systematic investigation of the properties of the\ndetected 13 early-type galaxies.\n\n3.1 K band luminosity and X-ray luminosity\nIn Fig. 5 we plot for each source the unabsorbed power-law X-ray\nluminosity versus the K band luminosity. LK was derived from K20\nmeasured within the 20 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote (taken from Two\nMicron All Sky Survey, 2MASS), using MK\u2299 = 3.33 mag. We also\nplot a straight line showing the linear relation between the X-ray\nluminosity of LMXB in a galaxy and the galaxy K band luminosity\n(from Kim & Fabbiano 2004). Kim & Fabbiano (2004) find a range\nin K band luminosity of 7 to 40\u00d71010 LK\u2299, which is a similar range\nto our galaxies. All but two of our sources lie below the relation.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n10\nLK (1010 LK\u0e4f)\n\nFigure 5. X-ray luminosity vs K band luminosity plot. The straight line is\nthe linear relation between the X-ray luminosity of LMXB and the K band\nluminosity of a galaxy, taken from Kim & Fabbiano (2004).\n\nTherefore the galaxies appear superficially underluminous in point\nsources.\nTo assess the effect of instrumental effects and projection of\nintracluster medium on the detectability of point sources, we compared from Perseus NGC 1278 (LK = 40.55 \u00d7 1010 LK\u2299 ), the optically brightest galaxy detected here, against the publicly-available\nChandra observation of NGC 720 (LK = 18.58 \u00d7 1010 LK\u2299 ).\nNGC 720 lies at a distance of 28 Mpc, is not in a cluster and has\na Chandra observation of 40 ks length (OBSID 492). To account\nfor the effect of distance on the spatial scale, we binned the image\nof NGC 720 by a factor of 3, and smoothed it by 1 arcsec to account for the PSF at the position of NGC 1278. From this image\nwe subtracted a flat background, then multiplied the image by a\nfactor of 2.3 to account for the difference in exposure time and distance between the Perseus and NGC 720 observations. We added a\nflat background component to account for the projected intracluster medium in Perseus. Finally we generated an image by making a\nPoisson realization of our model, to account for counting statistics.\nWe show an image of NGC 1278, NGC 720 before processing, and\nthe final simulated NGC 720 image in Fig. 6.\nIt is clear that most of the halo of point sources (LMXB)\nspread several arcmin around NGC 720 become undetectable under the observing conditions of NGC 1278. The situation would become worse after the higher absorption to the Perseus cluster is included. We only detect in NGC 1278 a point source coincident with\nthe nucleus and a possible LMXB to the SW. It would be interesting to see whether this last source coincides with a globular cluster\nthere but we have found no published information of globular clusters in our 13 galaxies. We conclude that the low X-ray luminosity\nof most of the 13 galaxies, when compared with nearby ones, is\ndue to our inability to resolve the expected, spatially-distributed,\npopulation of point sources.\n\n\f6\n\nS.

We\nplot FUV and NUV AB magnitudes against the unabsorbed powerlaw X-ray luminosity in Fig. 7. We see that there is no obvious correlation between UV and X-ray fluxes. The FUV and NUV magnitudes vary from 19 \u2212 21.5 and 18 \u2212 20.5 respectively, whereas the\nX-ray luminosity ranges by almost a factor of 100.\nWe found only four published values of radio power for the 13\ngalaxies. These are at 1.4 GHz data and from Miller & Owen (2001)\nand Sijbring (1993). The values of the logarithm of radio power in\nW Hz\u22121 are 21.9, 21.2, 21.5 and 21.2 for CGCG 540-101, NGC\n1277, NGC 1278 and NGC 1281, respectively.\n\nThe black hole mass of each galaxy was calculated using the\nrelation from Marconi & Hunt (2003), relating MBH and LK,bul for\nthe 'Group 1' galaxies:\nlog MBH ( M\u2299 ) = (8.21\u00b10.07)+(1.13\u00b10.012)(log LK,bul \u221210.9), (1)\nwhere LK,bul is in units of LK\u2299.

We assume that the gas has a density of\n0.02 cm\u22123 and velocity/sound speed of 103 km s\u22121 . With a typical bolometric correction of 10 in the 0.5\u20137 keV band for sources\nat low Eddington rate (Vasudevan & Fabian 2007), most of our\nsources have X-ray luminosities close to that expected from Bondi\naccretion (Fig. 8), especially when variations in velocity etc. are\nconsidered. Where there are mini-haloes, and it is plausible that\nthey all have some form of mini-halo due to central stellar mass\nloss, then the expected accretion luminosity should be up to 103\ntimes higher owing to the gas being much denser and cooler. If\nthese galaxies do contain mini haloes then they are further extreme\nexamples of the general problem found for the supermassive black\nholes in early-type galaxies (Fabian & Canizares 1988; Pellegrini\n2005). On simple grounds they should all be much more luminous\nthan observed if the black hole accretes in a radiatively-efficient\nmanner. None are as faint as our own Galactic Centre, Sgr A*, but\nthere is the fuel at hand for them to be much brighter.\nThe solution may lie in ADAFs (Narayan & Yi 1995) or other\nradiatively inefficient flows or with outflows so that little matter\nreaches the centre (Blandford & Begelman 1999). The luminosity\nof the sources may also act back on the accreting gas (Ostriker et\nal. 1976; Di Matteo et al 2003). Alternatively the matter may accrete to the centre and power relativistic jets (e.g. Allen et al 2006),\nwhich can be very radiatively inefficient. We do not however see\nany disturbance in the surrounding hot gas, nor radio emission,\nwhich would be expected to accompany such powerful jets.\nOur results do not distinguish which solution is the more correct, but underscore the widespread nature of the problem.\n\n1038\n1\n\n10\n\nBlack hole mass (108 M\u0e4f)\nFigure 8. Unabsorbed power-law X-ray luminosity plotted against black\nhole mass. The numbers are the distance in arcmin between the central\ngalaxy and the detected galaxies. Objects with a minihalo are plotted with\nan open symbol. The solid line represents the expected bolometric luminosity from Bondi accretion and the dashed line the 0.5\u20137 keV luminosity (see\nSection 4).\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nAll of the bright early-type galaxies in the region studied are detected in X-rays. The X-ray luminosities range from just below\n1039 erg s\u22121 to \u223c 5 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 in an unresolved component.\nThe sources are spatially coincident, or consistent within uncertainties, with the centres of the galaxies. The LMXB expected in\nthese galaxies are barely detectable owing to the high background\ndue to the dense intracluster gas.\nAll 13 sources have a power-law spectral component and 4\nhave an additional thermal component, suggestive of a mini-halo\n(as also found by Sun et al 2007). The photon index of the powerlaw is steeper than typically expected from LMXB (\u0393 \u223c 1.6; Irwin,\n\n5 CONCLUSION\nWe have made a detailed analysis of X-ray point sources detected\nwith a deep Chandra ACIS-S observation of the core of the Perseus\ncluster. The main observational results and conclusions of our study\nare:\n(i) We have found a total of 13 X-ray sources coincident with the\nnuclei of early-type galaxies projected near the centre of Perseus\ncluster (excluding NGC 1275).\n(ii) All 13 sources have a power-law spectra component and 4\nhave an additional thermal component.\n(iii) No obvious correlations are found between X-ray luminosities and the K band luminosities, UV AB magnitudes and black\nhole masses of the galaxies.\n(iv) Our results are consistent with the nuclei of all early-type\ngalaxies in rich clusters being active, albeit at a low level.\n(v) There is no apparent difference between the X-ray luminosity of nuclei in a minihalo compared with those with no detected\nminihalo. Bondi accretion, for those nuclei with a minihalo, should\nmake them much more luminous.\n(vi) Some form of radiatively-inefficient accretion is likely operating in these sources.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fAGN in the Perseus cluster\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank R.
