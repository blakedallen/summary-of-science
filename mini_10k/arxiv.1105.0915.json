Within the collision growth scenario for planetesimal formation, the growth step from centimetre-sized pre-planetesimals\nto kilometre-sized planetesimals is still unclear. The formation of larger objects from the highly porous pre-planetesimals may be\nhalted by a combination of fragmentation in disruptive collisions and mutual rebound with compaction. However, the right amount\nof fragmentation is necessary to explain the observed dust features in late T Tauri discs. Therefore, detailed data on the outcome of\npre-planetesimal collisions is required and has to be presented in a suitable and precise format.\nAims. We wish to develop a new classification scheme broad enough to encompass all events with sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation contributions, accurate enough to capture the important collision outcome nuances, and at the same time simple enough to be\nimplementable in global dust coagulation simulations. We furthermore wish to demonstrate the reliability of our numerical smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics (SPH) model and the applicability of our new collision outcome classification to previous results as well as\nour simulation results.\nMethods. We propose and apply a scheme based on the quantitative aspects of four fragment populations: the largest and second\nlargest fragment, a power-law population, and a sub-resolution population. For the simulations of pre-planetesimal collisions, we\nadopt the SPH numerical scheme with extensions for the simulation of porous solid bodies. On the basis of laboratory benchmark experiments, this model was previously calibrated and tested for the correct simulation of the compaction, bouncing, and fragmentation\nbehaviour of macroscopic highly porous SiO2 dust aggregates.\nResults. We demonstrate that previous attempts to map collision data were much too oriented on qualitatively categorising into sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation events. Intermediate categories are found in our simulations that are difficult to map to existing\nqualitative categorisations. We show that the four-population model encompasses all previous categorisations and in addition allows\nfor transitions. This is because it is based on quantitative characteristic attributes of each population such as the mass, kinetic energy,\nand filling factor. In addition, the numerical porosity model successfully passes another benchmark test: the correct simulation of the\nentire list of collision outcome types yielded by laboratory experiments. As a demonstration of the applicability and the power of\nthe four-population model, we utilise it to present the results of a study on the influence of collision velocity in head-on collisions of\nintermediate porosity aggregates.\nKey words. accretion, accretion discs - hydrodynamics - methods: data analysis - methods: numerical - planets and satellites: formation - protoplanetary discs\n\n1. Introduction\nThe primary way in which rocky planets are thought to form\nis by core accretion in protoplanetary discs consisting of gas\nand dust. Interaction between these components induces relative velocities and consequential mutual collisions among the\ninitially micron-sized dust grains (e.g. Weidenschilling 1977b,\nWeidenschilling & Cuzzi 1993). In this way, millimetre- to\ncentimetre-sized fluffy dust aggregates grow by a simple hitand-stick mechanism (e.g. Blum & Wurm 2008). The growth\nmechanism in the pre-planetesimal regime (centimetre to kilometre) is unclear and is addressed in this paper. Once a sufficient\npopulation of kilometre-sized objects has formed, gravitationassisted accretion ensures the final assembly of full-sized planets (e.g. Goldreich et al. 2004). The planetary building blocks in\nthis gravity-dominated regime are referred to as planetesimals.\nThe growth step from pre-planetesimals to planetesimals is\nnot well-constrained and the subject of extensive numerical and\nexperimental effort. The difficulties to overcome in this step\ncan be characterised with three types of barriers: fragmenta-\n\ntion, drift, and bouncing barrier (e.g. Zsom et al. 2010). The\nmost serious barrier is the fragmentation barrier: with increasing size, the relative velocities between pre-planetesimals increase and potentially lead to catastrophic disruption in mutual collisions. Often a velocity threshold of 1 ms\u22121 for disruptive events is assumed (Blum & M\u00fcnch 1993). The threshold is\nmostly assumed to be as independent of other parameters such\nas porosity, mass ratio, and impact parameter (e.g. G\u00fcttler et al.\n2010). With the assumption of this fragmentation threshold and\npower-law distributed fragments, Brauer et al. (2008) find that\ndust coagulation is halted at centimetre or even millimetre sizes.\nTeiser & Wurm (2009) proposed a growth model that is based\nmainly on the accretion of fragments < 1 mm by larger objects\nand therefore requires some amount of disruptive collisions.\nThe second obstacle to planetesimal formation is the radial drift of larger pre-planetesimals (Weidenschilling 1977a).\nOwing to its pressure support, the gas in the disc rotates at a subKeplerian velocity, whereas the solid material lacks this pressure\nsupport and tends to rotate at a Keplerian velocity. As a con1\n\n\fRalf J. Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nsequence, the solid objects feel a headwind that causes an inward drift. For the minimum-mass solar nebula, it takes roughly\na century for metre sized objects to drift from 1 AU into the\nstar. In contrast, for centimetre- and kilometre-sized objects it\ntakes \u223c 105 yr. This is because small objects are strongly coupled to the motion of the gas, whereas large objects are almost\ndecoupled. As a consequence, in the intermediate regime, metresized objects are quickly lost by accretion onto the host star or\nby photoevaporation in the hot zones close to it. Collective effects in the midplane of the protoplanetary disc might diminish the problem (e.g. Cuzzi et al. 1993, Dominik et al. 2007,\nWeidenschilling 2010).\nOn the basis of empirical data showing the existence of rebound in dust collisions (Blum & M\u00fcnch 1993,\nHeisselmann et al. 2007, Langkowski et al. 2008, Weidling et al.\n2009, G\u00fcttler et al. 2010), Zsom et al. (2010) introduced a possible new obstacle to growth: the bouncing barrier, where collision\ngrowth is halted at centimetre-sized pebbles. In the collisions,\naggregates only become compacted in mutual collisions but do\nnot grow any further. However, recent studies (Geretshauser et\nal., in prep., Wada et al., in prep.) indicate that the collision parameter space governed by bouncing may have been estimated\nto be too large by G\u00fcttler et al. (2010) and that rebound is not as\nfrequent as they inferred.\nHowever, fragmentation is also necessary in discs.\nObservations (e.g. Natta et al. 2007) suggest that sub-millimetre\nsized dust and millimetre- to centimetre-sized pebbles are\npresent for as long as about 106 yr in T Tauri discs. However,\nDullemond & Dominik (2005) find that without fragmentation\nthe disc is depleted of small grains within 103 yr. This is\ncommonly referred to as the grain retention problem. With\ncoagulation simulations, Birnstiel et al. (2009, 2010) tried to\nmatch the fragment distribution of disruptive events with the\nobservational data.\nTo summarise, the formation of planetesimals requires\nthe right amount of sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation to\nbe consistent with observations. Therefore, collisions of preplanetesimals have to be investigated as thoroughly as possible\nand their outcome has to be mapped as precisely as possible taking into account all the relevant parameters such as initial porosity, collision partner size, impact velocity, mass ratio, and rotation. To classify collision outcomes, G\u00fcttler et al. (2010) compiled 19 experiments and mapped them to four types of sticking, two types of bouncing, and three types of fragmentation.\nHowever, owing to experimental restrictions they covered only\nsmall parts of the relevant parameter space. Many of their findings were not deduced from collisions between porous dust aggregates, but from dust collisions with a solid object. Collisions\nbetween aggregates larger than the decimetre size were not possible because of the limitations of their experimental apparatus.\nIn addition, not all experiments could be carried out in protoplanetary disc conditions, i.e., in a vacuum and under microgravity.\nAn alternative to experiments is to study pre-planetesimal\ncollisions numerically. To explore the region where experimental data is lacking, we perform simulations of pre-planetesimal\ncollisions with our solid-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code, which was previously used by Sch\u00e4fer et al.\n(2007) to emphasise the importance of precise material parameters and a thorough calibration of the implemented porosity\nmodel. Geretshauser et al. (2010) expanded the porosity model\nand both calibrated and tested it extensively to simulate preplanetary dust material based on laboratory benchmark experiments (G\u00fcttler et al. 2009). The code and calibration procedure\nis briefly described in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, we show that the code can\n2\n\nfurthermore reproduce all sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation\ntypes proposed by G\u00fcttler et al. (2010). However, we find that\ntheir categorisation can also introduce unnecessary complexity\nand on some occasions may lack the required accuracy. It is possible that in a collision more than one process of sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation can take place and qualitative models do\nnot make it clear whether the overall growth is positive, negative,\nor neutral. Therefore, we propose a new, simpler but at the same\ntime more quantitative model for mapping collision data that\nis presented in Sec. 4. To show the applicability of this model,\nwe present the first results of simulations of collisions between\nmacroscopic objects consisting of realistic pre-planetesimal material in Sec. 5. We finally summarise our findings and discuss\nfuture work in Sec. 6.\n\n2. Code and calibration\nFor the simulations presented in this paper, we utilise the parallel SPH code parasph (Hipp & Rosenstiel 2004, Sch\u00e4fer 2005,\nSch\u00e4fer et al. 2007), which was calibrated to simulate porous\ndust material (Geretshauser et al. 2010). This section briefly\nsummarises the numerical model and calibration procedure.\n2.1. SPH and porosity model\n\nFor collision simulations, SPH as a meshless Lagrangian particle method is superior to grid-based methods. This is because the continuous fluid or solid is divided into interacting mass packages, which serve as numerical sampling\npoints and form a natural frame of reference for deformation and fragmentation (see reviews, e.g. by Monaghan 2005\nand Rosswog 2009). Originally developed for astrophysical\nfluid flows, SPH has also been extended to model solid material (e.g. Libersky & Petschek 1991, Benz & Asphaug 1994,\nRandles & Libersky 1996, Libersky et al. 1997).\nWithin the SPH scheme, the equations of continuum mechanics are solved in their Lagrangian form. In this framework,\nthe continuity and momentum equations are given by\nd\u03c1\n\u2202v\u03b1\n,\n= \u2212\u03c1\ndt\n\u2202x\u03b1\ndv\u03b1 1 \u2202\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n,\n=\ndt\n\u03c1 \u2202x\u03b2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere the Greek indices indicate the spatial components and the\nEinstein sum convention is applied. The quantities \u03c1 and v are\nthe density and velocity, respectively, and \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 is the stress tensor\nwhich is defined as\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212p\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + S \u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere p is the pressure, which accounts for pure hydrostatic\ncompression or tension, and S \u03b1\u03b2 is the deviatoric stress tensor,\nwhich represents pure shear. For the time evolution of the deviatoric stress tensor in the elastic regime, we adopt the approach of\nBenz & Asphaug (1994), which uses the Jaumann rate form and\nfollows Hooke's law. The elastic hydrostatic pressure is modelled as part of the porous equation of state (Eq. 8).\nTo model sub-resolution porosity, we relate the filling factor\n\u03c6 to the continuous quantities according to\n\u03c6=\n\n\u03c1\n,\n\u03c1s\n\n(4)\n\n\fRalf J. Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nwhere \u03c1s = 2000 kg m\u22123 is the density of the matrix material\nof SiO2 (e.g. Blum & Schr\u00e4pler 2004). Table 1 shows the material parameters of the calibrated porosity model determined by\nGeretshauser et al. (2010). To model the plastic behaviour, we\nmodified the approach by Sirono (2004), who models plasticity\nwith filling-factor-dependent strength quantities. The compressive strength \u03a3(\u03c6), the tensile strength T (\u03c6), and shear strength\nY(\u03c6) represent transition thresholds between the elastic and plastic regime. In particular, we adopt the relations (see G\u00fcttler et al.\n2009 and Geretshauser et al. 2010)\n!\u2206 ln 10\n\u03c6max \u2212 \u03c6min\n\u03a3(\u03c6) = pm\n\u22121\n,\n(5)\n\u03c6max \u2212 \u03c6\nfor \u03c6min +\u03b5 < \u03c6 < \u03c6max and \u03b5 = 0.005. The quantities \u03c6min = 0.12\nand \u03c6max = 0.58 denote the minimum and maximum filling factors, respectively, in the compressive strength relation. However,\nthe material can exceed both of these values. The power of the\ncompressive strength relation is ln(10) times the parameter \u2206\nwith \u2206 = 0.58 (see Geretshauser et al. 2010, for a study of this\nparameter), which can be found together with the other material parameters in Table 1. For \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c6min + \u03b5, the compressive\nstrength relation is continuously extended by the constant function \u03a3(\u03c6) = \u03a3(\u03c6min + \u03b5) and for \u03c6max \u2264 \u03c6 we set \u03a3(\u03c6) = \u221e.

Calibration procedure\n\nThe above porosity model was carefully calibrated and tested in\nGeretshauser et al. (2010) with the aid of three benchmark experiments (G\u00fcttler et al. 2009): (1) the compaction of dust by a\nglass sphere, (2) the rebound of a dust aggregate from a solid\nsurface, and (3) the fragmentation of a dust aggregate colliding\nwith a solid surface. This is the most elaborate material calibration which is available for astrophysically relevant macroscopic\ndust aggregates. All benchmark experiments were carried out in\nthe laboratory as well as in simulations.\nBecause compaction of porous material is a very efficient energy dissipation mechanism that allows dust aggregates to stick\nrather than break apart, in our first experiment we tested the compression properties of the model, ensuring that both the dynamic\ncompressive strength and the shear strength relations were calibrated.\nSince rebound is discussed as an obstacle to planetesimal\nformation, the second benchmark experiment tested the bouncing properties of a dust aggregate. With the aid of this benchmark\nsetup, we calibrated the bulk modulus as a characteristic quantity of the elastic properties. We also confirmed the relation of\nthe compressive strength which is a characteristic quantity for\nthe energy dissipation during compaction.\nFor pre-planetesimal collisions that end in fragmentation, the\nlargest fragment and the mass distribution of the fragments is\nhighly important for subsequent collisions. For this reason, our\nlast calibration experiment tested the correct reproduction of the\nfragmentation properties of the porosity model. The bulk modulus, which is the quantity that has the strongest influence on the\nfragment mass distribution, was also confirmed.\nAfter the successful calibration procedure, we are able to\ncorrectly reproduce the compaction, bouncing, and fragmentation behaviour of porous SiO2 dust aggregates quantitatively\nwith one consistent set of material parameters as shown in Table\n1. These material parameters are used for all simulations discussed in the following.\n\n3. Reproducing sticking, bouncing, and\nfragmentation collision types\nG\u00fcttler et al. (2010) compiled a large number of experiments\nwith dust aggregates and suggested categorising them into four\ntypes of sticking, two types of bouncing, and three types of fragmentation. The sticking events were subdivided according to\nsticking mechanisms (hit-and-stick for micron sized monomers,\nsurface effects, or deep penetration) and a quantitative criterion (mass transfer). Growth neutral bouncing with compaction\n3\n\n\fRalf J. Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nFig. 1. The outcome of our simulations of pre-planetesimal collisions encompasses all sticking (S), bouncing (B), and fragmentation\n(F) types proposed by G\u00fcttler et al. (2010). The initial configuration for each simulation is a sphere with radius rt = 10 cm as resting\ntarget and a sphere with rp = 6 cm as projectile except for S3 and F2, where rp = 2 cm. The colour code indicates the filling factor \u03c6.\nBoth objects are initially set up with \u03c6 = 0.35 except for the F2 case, where \u03c6 = 0.55. The simulations are carried out with different\nimpact velocities and the snap shots are taken at different times. The details are given in the text.\nand bouncing with mass transfer were distinguished in terms of\nrebound. Fragmentation was classified according to its degree\n(complete fragmentation or erosion) and whether some sticking\nwas involved (fragmentation with mass transfer).\nIn this section we show that our code and its underlying calibrated porosity model can reproduce these empirical outcome\ntypes in numerical simulations. Images of the final result of each\nexample simulation are presented in Fig. 1 according to this categorisation. The end times of the simulations are chosen by visual\ncontrol of the fragment evolution and particle velocities close to\nthe thermal equilibrium for each fragment. For each category, an\nexterior view (left) and a cut through the centre of the resulting\naggregate(s) (right) is shown (except for type F1). The target is\nalways a dust aggregate with radius rt = 10 cm modelled using 238,238 SPH particles. The projectiles are modelled using\n1,905 and 51,477 SPH particles for projectile radii rp = 2 cm\nand rp = 6 cm, respectively, and placed on a cubic lattice with\n4\n\nedge length 2.6 mm. The collision partners are aligned head on\nwith a shift of half a lattice constant into each direction perpendicular to the collision axis to avoid particle interpenetration. In\nall simulations (except F2), both objects are set up with \u03c6 = 0.35\nand the masses of the target, and the 6 cm-, and 2 cm-projectiles\nare 2.93 kg, 0.63 kg, and 0.023 kg, respectively. An overview\nof the initial conditions of the simulations is given in Table 2.\nThe colour in Fig. 1 indicates the filling factor \u03c6. We now discuss the simulation outcomes in detail. We adopt the notation by\nG\u00fcttler et al. (2010).\nS1 (hit & stick) is not represented in Fig. 1 as it is not applicable within the continuous SPH scheme. This category describes\nthe outcome of collisions in which microscopic fractal dust aggregates are involved. In this regime, the continuum limit, which\nis a fundamental assumption of our model, is invalid. We focus\non collisions of macroscopic dust since for the fractal regime the\nnumerical and empirical basis is profound.\n\n\fRalf J. Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nS2 (sticking through surface effects) The example shows the\nresult of the impact of an aggregate with radius rp = 6 cm and\ncollision velocity v0 = 2.0 ms\u22121. The image shows the situation\n250 ms after the impact. The filling factor of the outer shell of\nthe aggregates remains nearly unchanged as indicated by the exterior view. In contrast, large parts of the interior are compressed\nto \u03c6 \u223c 0.45. The target and the projectile merge to form one object. The initial setup matches that used for the B2 case but has\na higher impact velocity. As a consequence, the contact area is\nlarger and compressed to higher filling factors. This leads to a\nhigher tensile strength in this region, which prevents the objects\nfrom rebounding from each other. This situation is referred to as\nsticking through surface effects. A single aggregate remains and\nno fragments are ejected.\nS3 (sticking by deep penetration) is found in our simulations\nif the projectile is sufficiently smaller than the target. In the example case, the projectile has a radius of rp = 2 cm and hits the\ntarget with v0 = 10.0 ms\u22121. The image is taken 388 ms after the\nimpact. A small crater is formed on the target and a small number of single SPH particles are ejected. This characterises deep\npenetration. The crater is visible in the cross-section. Material is\ncompressed to a maximum of \u03c6 \u223c 0.52 down to a depth of about\none target radius.\nS4 (mass transfer) occurs if the projectile is large and moves\nfast enough to stick but still slow enough to not fully disrupt\nthe target. As an example, we choose an impact of a 6 cm aggregate onto a target with the same filling factor. The impact\nvelocity is v0 = 10.0 ms\u22121 and the image shows the result after\n50 ms. During the collision, the target is highly deformed and\ncompressed to filling factors of \u03c6 \u223c 0.45 to 0.52. Single SPH\nparticles are ejected. Most of the projectile merges, which accounts for the mass transfer. The final mass of the largest fragment is 3.56 kg.\nB1 (bouncing with compaction) is only seen in the case of\nobjects of medium and low porosity at low collision speeds.\nHighly porous objects have an extremely low compressive\nstrength. As a consequence, low pressures suffice to plastically\ndeform the target and the highly porous aggregates do not gain\nenough elastic loading for bouncing. In our example, the projectile is 6 cm in radius. It impacts at v0 = 1.0 ms\u22121 . In Fig. 1, the\nfinal state at 500 ms is shown. In the collision, both objects are\nflattened at the impact site and the elastic loading is sufficient to\nmake them rebound after the impact. Part of the interior of the\ntarget and projectile is compressed to \u03c6 \u223c 0.45. We note that this\nis exactly the same setup as in the S2 case but with a lower impact velocity. The bouncing event is a result of a smaller contact\narea and a lower tensile strength in this region, which is indicated\nby the lower filling factor. As a consequence, the two objects rebound. A close investigation reveals that in nearly every simulation with bouncing, a small amount of material is transferred\nbetween the projectile and target. Thus, it is very unlikely that\npure growth neutral bouncing without any mass transfer exists.\nIn this particular simulation, material of \u223c 0.54 g is transferred\nfrom the projectile to the target. Hence, the result could also be\nclassified into the next category.\nB2 (bouncing with mass transfer) occurs in simulations\nwhere the compressive strength is sufficiently large to allow for\nelastic loading and consequential bouncing, and where the tensile strength is small enough for the impactor to rip out a small\nfraction of mass from the target. This happens at very low impact speeds. The final state at 1.7 s after the collision is the result\nof a collision with v0 = 0.2 ms\u22121. The projectile has rp = 6 cm.\nDuring the impact, a small region of target and projectile is com-\n\npressed to \u03c6 \u223c 0.45. In the consequential rebound, this region\nsticks to the projectile and is ripped out of the target. The remaining crater on the target can be seen in the cross-section. In\nthis collision, 29.5 g are transferred from the target to the projectile.\nF1 (fragmentation) is generally the outcome of collisions\nwith high impact velocities. Highly porous objects effectively\ndissipate energy by deformation because of their low compressive strength but they are also easy to disrupt because of their low\ntensile strength. In contrast, objects of low porosity have high\ntensile strengths, but lack the ability to dissipate large amounts of\nkinetic energy. The degree of fragmentation is therefore strongly\nporosity dependent. Our example shows the result of a collision\nbetween objects, where the projectile features rp = 6 cm. The\nimpact speed is v0 = 17.5 ms\u22121. During the collision, both the\ntarget and the projectile completely shatter and the result of this\ncollision (shown only in exterior view 800 ms after the impact)\nis a continuous fragment distribution, whose masses range from\n285 g down to single SPH particles of 12 mg. The fragments consist of target and projectile material that are indistinguishably\ncombined together. The filling factors of the fragment distribution are \u03c6 \u223c 0.54, which is close to the maximum filling factor\nof 0.58 (see Table 1).\nF2 (erosion) is observed particularly for high filling factors\nand small projectile radii. The initial setup for the example case\ninvolves two objects with \u03c6 = 0.55. The target and projectile\nmasses were 4.60 kg and 0.037 kg, respectively. The projectile\nradius is rp = 2 cm and the impact velocity v0 = 20.0 ms\u22121 .\nDuring the intrusion of the projectile, fragments consisting of a\nsmall number of SPH particles are ejected opposite the impact\nsite. The figure shows the situation 438 ms after the collision,\nwhere small fragments and SPH particles are ejected from the\ncrater. In this collision, 63.2 g of material are eroded from the\ntarget. The projectile intrudes to the centre of the target and the\nintrusion channel is clearly visible in the cross-section. Because\nof the high compressive strength elastic deformation also takes\nplace on the target. The figure shows a snap shot of a decompression wave of lower filling factor, which appears as a vertical\nring on the target.\nThe category F3 (fragmentation with mass transfer) contains conceptual difficulties. The first reason is that in the simulation outcomes of the F1 and F2 categories, some mass is\nalways transferred to the target. Secondly, the demarcation between sticking with mass transfer (S4) and F3 is unclear and a\ncontinuous transition between these categories is expected. This\nproblem can be solved by our new model proposed below. Our\nsimulations incorporate category F3 by reproducing the S4 and\nF1 types.\nIn conclusion, our code is not only capable of quantitatively\nreproducing sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation in general\n(Geretshauser et al. 2010) but also of correctly simulating the\nsub-types for each macroscopic collision outcome. However, we\nalso experienced difficulties in classifying the results of our simulations according to the model of G\u00fcttler et al. (2010). This motivates our wish to find a new approach.\n\n4. A new model for mapping collision outcomes\nWe introduce a new model to classify the outcome of preplanetesimal collisions. We first describe its structure. We then\nshow that all sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation events of the\nprevious section can be incorporated into the new model.\n5\n\n\fRalf J.

The motivation behind a new classification scheme\n\nThe model of G\u00fcttler et al. (2010) was developed based on particular laboratory setups. In several of these, one of the collision\npartners was not a dust aggregate but a solid surface or a glass\nbead, which itself cannot fragment. Therefore, applying this categorisation to pre-planetesimal dust collisions, which here are\nsolely carried out as simulations between dust aggregates, leads\nto some difficulties.\nIn our simulations, the collisions of S3 (sticking by penetration) always produce ejected dust. Therefore, it is unclear\nwhether they should be classified as S3 or rather S4 (mass transfer). On the other hand, S2 (sticking through surface effects) involves also a mass transfer but without the production of fragments. It can also be expected that there is a continuous transition from S2 to S3 with increasing impact velocity. The demarcation between the sticking types is also conceptually difficult to\nmake. The types S1 to S3 are distinguished on the basis of the\nsticking mechanism, whereas for S4 the criterion is an increase\nin target mass and the generation of some fragments. In the context of pre-planetesimal growth, the exact sticking mechanism is\nof minor importance. The distinction between growing and disruptive events is simply given by comparing the largest fragment\nbefore and after the collision.\nApplying the bouncing categories to collision data also\ncauses some difficulties. Pure bouncing with compaction (B1)\nevents are never seen in our simulations. Analysing the final\nmass of both collision partners after the impact reveals that some\nmass is always transferred either from the projectile to the target or vice versa. In the first case, growth occurs and the result should be categorised under S4 with a growing target, but\nwith one remaining fragment instead of a fragment distribution.\nIf mass is transferred to the projectile, then the event belongs\nto B2 (bouncing with mass transfer). However, since the largest\nobject is losing mass, B2 is also a type of erosion (F2), where\ninstead of a fragment distribution only one large fragment (the\nenlarged projectile) is present. Since bouncing may be an obstacle to planetesimal growth (Zsom et al. 2010), the effect of\nbouncing has to be included in any collision map. However, instead of distinguishing between two types of bouncing, we find\nthat it is sufficient to distinguish between the mass of the largest\nand the second largest fragment.\nAnalysing the numerical results for disruptive events, it is\nalso hard to distinguish between types F1 (fragmentation) and\nF3 (fragmentation with mass transfer). As already mentioned\nabove, in any fragmenting collision, mass is transferred from the\nprojectile to the target and the fragments consist of both projectile and target material. In eroding events (F2), mass is also\ntransferred to the target and a fragment distribution is produced.\n6\n\nOnce again the continuous transition between the three fragmentation types and between sticking and fragmentation events cannot adequately be described by the given model. In our view, it\nis sufficient to characterise the outcome of disruptive events in\nterms of the size of the largest fragment (which for F2 is much\nlarger than the other fragments) and a power-law distribution of\nthe remaining fragments. Thus, for correct mapping of any combination of sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation, the following\nobjects have to be considered: both a largest and a second largest\nfragment as well as a power-law fragment distribution.\nThis discussion shows that the classification of different\nsticking, bouncing, and fragmentation events is not sufficient.\nThis is because many intermediate events exist. For example,\na bouncing event can involve some sticking and fragmentation,\nwhereas a sticking event can also involve some fragmentation.\nThe model by G\u00fcttler et al. (2010) tries to capture these intermediate events. However, it is based on physical mechanisms\nrather than collision outcome. Owing to its discrete approach,\nthe model generates some unnecessary complexity and cannot\neasily describe transitions between categories. To improve on\nthis, we propose a model that is based solely on quantitative aspects. It distinguishes between four types of fragment populations characterised by continuous quantities such as their mass,\nfilling factors, velocities, and size. In this way, we are able to\nmap all types of sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation events\nbut also model continuous transitions between these types.\n4.2. Fragment populations\n\nThe fundamental idea of the new classification is that any outcome of a collision can adequately be modelled by distinguishing four kinds of fragment \"populations\". This is illustrated in\nFig. 2. Example input parameters for the collision include the\nmasses of the target (label \"t\") mt and projectile (label \"p\") mp ,\ntheir filling factors \u03c6t and \u03c6p , their rotational energies Erot,t and\nErot,p , their impact parameter b and, most importantly, their collision velocity v0 (see Fig. 2, left). Depending on these parameters, the collision between two bodies produces a well-defined\noutcome of populations. To be able to map sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation events, it is suitable to sort this distribution according to the mass of the fragments in the respective\npopulation. For these, output parameters such as mass, filling\nfactor, rotational energy, and velocity are determined as exact\nor averaged values, or as distributions depending on the population. Specifically, the new scheme consists of the following\nfour types: (1) largest fragment, (2) second largest fragment, (3)\npower-law population, and (4) sub-resolution population.\n(a) Largest fragment: Comparing the mass of the largest\nfragment before and after a collision distinguishes between positive and negative growth. The characteristic output quantities are\nsupplied.\n(b) Second largest fragment: This enables bouncing events to\nbe mapped. In pure bouncing events, the largest and the second\nlargest fragment will be the only members of the fragment population. The quantities describing this fragment are supplied. The\nsecond largest fragment only exists if it consists of more than a\nsingle SPH particle.\n(c) Power-law population: in disruptive collision events in\nparticular, the mass distribution of the fragments can be modelled by a power-law to describe the fragment distribution.\nInstead of describing each fragment of the power-law population with quantities as done previously for the largest and second largest fragment, the number of parameters is reduced significantly by utilising distribution functions.\n\n\fRalf J. Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nFig. 2. Illustration of the four-population model. The left side displays the situation before the collision: two pre-planetesimals\ncollide with impact velocity v0 and impact parameter b. The target and projectile are characterised by their defining quantities,\ne.g., mass m, filling factor \u03c6, and rotational energy Erot . Depending on these parameters, an outcome population is generated in\nthe collision (middle). The four-population model distinguishes the fragments according to their mass. The population classes are:\n(a) the largest fragment, (b) the second largest fragment, (c) the power-law population, and (d) the sub-resolution population. This\ncategorisation is sufficient to describe the outcome types of Fig. 1 as well as intermediate outcomes.\n(d) Sub-resolution population: This population is introduced\nfor numerical reasons. Fragments of the sub-resolution population consist only of a single SPH particle. The existence of\nthis population represents the resolution limit of the simulations\nand therefore represents only an upper limit to the smallest dust\nfragments, which are produced in a collision. This population is\nalso convenient to control sufficient resolution. The SPH numerical scheme is capable of simulating objects of metre size and\nmore. However, because of limited computational resources, single SPH particles then represent objects of centimetre size and\nlarger. The sub-resolution population keeps track of these objects. It is convenient to describe this population with averaged\ncharacteristic quantities. We note that also in laboratory experiments a sub-resolution population exists, for which the fragment\ndistribution is determined by high speed cameras.\nWith this approach, we considerably reduce the complexity\nof the sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation classification from\nnine types of collision outcomes to four fragment populations.\nMoreover, our model is based solely on continuous quantities\ncharacterising the collision outcome and not on physical mechanisms. This allows us to model any mixed types of collisions\nand transitions between growth and disruption with the necessary accuracy.\nCompared to fragmentation data that are mapped to a powerlaw distribution alone (e.g. Mathis et al. 1977, Davis & Ryan\n1990, Blum & M\u00fcnch 1993, G\u00fcttler et al. 2010), the new model\nis also more accurate. In some of our simulations, a fragment distribution contains one large fragment and many small ones. The\nsmall ones can be accurately modelled with a power-law mass\ndistribution. However, the mass of the largest fragment often\ndoes not match the power law. This is particularly true for grazing collisions between highly porous aggregates, where the filling factor of the largest remnant differs significantly from those\nof the other fragments. Since this has a major impact on subsequent collisions, we treat the largest fragment and its filling\nfactor separately. Furthermore, power-law distributions cannot\nmap bouncing collisions. For these reasons, we distinguish the\n\nlargest and second largest fragment from the rest of the fragment\ndistribution.\nWith the four given fragment populations and their defining\nproperties, we present a closed model that is capable of modelling any collision outcome of pre-planetesimals with minimum\ncomplexity but with the accuracy necessary to model the dust aggregation in global coagulation models. In the next section, we\nshow how the model by G\u00fcttler et al. (2010) can be represented\nin our new model.\n4.3. Mapping sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation to the\nnew model\n\nThe key idea behind mapping the sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation sub-types to the four-population model is to describe\nthe collision outcome by the characteristic quantities of each of\nthe four populations. If one of the populations does not exist, its\ncharacteristic quantity is simply set to zero. In principle, a number of quantities can be used to determine the population. To\nillustrate the use of this model, we select the characteristic quantities mass m and filling factor \u03c6 as examples. Table 3 demonstrates the successful mapping of the G\u00fcttler et al. (2010) types\ninto our quantitative four-population model. The indices \"t\", \"p\",\n\"1\", \"2\", \"pw\", and \"sr\" denote target, projectile, largest, second\nlargest, power-law, and sub-resolution quantities, respectively.\nFor the illustration, we assume that the mass of the target mt is\ngreater than or equal to the projectile mass mp , i.e. mt \u2265 mp . We\nfind a filling factor increase in all collisions if the initial filling\nfactor is smaller than the maximum compaction at \u03c6max = 0.58\n(see Fig. 7 for the largest fragment).\nFor pure sticking (S1 to S3 types) only one fragment in the\nfinal population exists, which is identified as the largest fragment. Consequently, this fragment contains the mass of the total system, i.e. m1 = mt + mp . Within the four-population approach, the S1 to S3 sub-types can be combined in terms of the\nmass and filling factor. In general, the filling factor of the target \u03c6t is increased during the impact such that the filling factor\n7\n\n\fRalf J. Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nTable 3. Mapping sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. In this table, we illustrate how the collision outcome types of Sec. 3 can\nbe mapped to the four-population model using the characteristic quantities mass m and filling factor \u03c6 as examples. The masses\nof the largest and second largest fragment, the power-law population, and the sub-resolution population are given by m1 , m2 , mpw ,\nand msr , respectively. We assume for the target mass mt and projectile mass mp before the collision mt \u2265 mp .

For sticking with mass transfer (S4), a range of fragments exists. Since sticking is identified\nwith growth of the largest fragment, it is m1 > mt . If there are\nonly fragments below the resolution limit, then the mass of the\nsecond largest fragment m2 and the mass of the power-law population mpw vanish. Otherwise there are a range of fragments with\nnon-zero masses.\nBouncing is characterised by two fragments in the final\nfragment distribution. For bouncing with compaction (B1), the\nmasses are unaltered, i.e., m1 = mt and m2 = mp , but the filling\nfactors are increased such that \u03c61 > \u03c6t and \u03c62 > \u03c6p . For the case\nof bouncing with mass transfer (B2), the filling factors are also\nincreased but the masses are altered such that m1 + m2 = mt + mp\nand m1 , mt as well as m2 , mp . By definition, no fragments\nare produced in the bouncing events such that mpw = msr = 0.\nFor B2, the filling factors are also increased, i.e., \u03c61 > \u03c6t and\n\u03c62 > \u03c6p .\nThe fragmentation events (F1 to F2 types) are characterised\nby the mass of the largest fragment being lower than the highest\nmass before the collision, i.e. m1 < mt . The distinction between\nF1 and F2 in terms of the collision outcome is unclear. In both\ncases, a power-law as well as a sub-resolution population is generated, i.e. mpw > 0 and msr > 0. It seems that for F2, the mass of\nthe target is only reduced by a small amount such that m1 . mt\n(G\u00fcttler et al. 2010). In this reference, F3 is also characterised by\nthe target (solid plate) gaining mass, i.e. m1 > mt . This is inconsistent with the idea that fragmentation is equivalent to m1 < mt .\nThe mass of the second largest fragment has some value m2 > 0\nand total masses of the power-law and sub-resolution populations are mpw > 0 and msr > 0.\nThe transition between sticking and fragmentation can consequently be characterised by the transition m1 > mt \u2192 m1 < mt ,\nsince for the S4 type power-law and sub-resolution population\nare already present. In contrast, the transition from bouncing\n(which also includes the change of target and projectile masses\nby mass transfer in B2) can be defined by the appearance of a\npower-law and sub-resolution population, i.e. mpw = 0 \u2192 mpw >\n0 and msr = 0 \u2192 msr > 0, together with a non-growing target\nm1 \u2264 mt .\nIn this section, we have shown that the four-population\nmodel for collision outcomes is capable of encompassing all the\nsticking, bouncing, and fragmentation sub-types.

We choose the initial filling factor of the aggregates to be \u03c6 = 0.35 resulting in target and projectile masses\nof 2.93 and 0.63 kg, respectively. We vary the collision velocity\nbetween 0.1 and 27.5 ms\u22121. Table 4 summarises the simulations\ncarried out. We broadly categorise the simulations by eye into\nbouncing, sticking, or fragmentation so that a comparison can\nbe made between the results of our model and the categorisations used previously. We note that these broad categorisations\nare only employed to show where the boundaries between these\nregimes lie and are not used for the quantitative approach of our\nmodel.\nAs discussed in Sec. 4.2, the outcome of pre-planetesimal\ncollisions can be quantitatively described by a number of parameters such as the final mass, size, energy, velocity, porosity,\nand rotation and each of these parameters can be used to describe\nthe four populations. In this preliminary, study we focus on the\nfinal mass, porosity, and energy of the different populations in\nour model.\nFigure 3 shows how the mass distribution amongst the four\npopulations varies with collision velocity. At low collision velocities, the contact energy and thus the tensile strength is too\nlow to hold the objects together. This results in bouncing causing the overall mass distribution being similar to the initial distribution. The collision with 0.2 ms\u22121 shows evidence of mass\ntransfer resulting in the largest fragment being smaller than the\ntarget. As the collision velocity increases, the energy is dissipated by plastic deformation resulting in sticking such that all\n\nthe mass is stored in a single object. At even higher collision velocities in which fragmentation is seen, the mass stored in the\nlargest fragment is reduced but is increasingly present in the\npower-law population. Figure 3 also shows how the mass of the\nlargest fragment varies with collision velocity. It can be seen that\nthree distinct regions exist, which justify the broad classification of Table 4. However, there do not appear to be any distinctions within these regions which justify an additional division\ninto sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation sub-types. A sharp\ntransition between the bouncing and sticking regions exists at\n\u223c 1 ms\u22121 . Above 10.5 ms\u22121, pure sticking no longer occurs and\nthe mass of the largest fragment begins to decrease as the transition between sticking and fragmentation takes place. As a result\nof very high collision velocities, the mass contribution of the\nsub-resolution population dominates over the largest and second\nlargest fragment which is an indicative of violent disruption. We\nnote that the simulation with collision velocity 11.5 ms\u22121 still results in collision growth but above this velocity the mass gain of\nthe largest fragment is negative.\nFigure 3 clearly shows that at velocities & 11.5 ms\u22121, pure\nsticking no longer occurs and a transition into the fragmentation regime begins. For the simulation with a collision velocity\nof 11.5 ms\u22121 (see Fig. 4, top, for an illustration of the resulting\nfragments), the mass of the largest fragment clearly increases\nbut according to the model by G\u00fcttler et al. (2010), it is unclear\nwhether this simulation would be classed as sticking with mass\ntransfer (S4) or fragmentation with mass transfer (F3). Using\nour model, such an intermediate region can be described quantitatively. At \u223c 12.5 ms\u22121 (see Fig. 4, bottom, for an illustration),\nthe mass contribution from the power-law population becomes\nas significant as the contribution from the largest fragment. In\nthis region, the target fragments into a small number of large\npieces. We expect that the transition from the sticking to fragmentation regime, described in Section 4.3, occurs between 11.5\nand 12.5 ms\u22121.\nUsing the model, it is clear that the mass of the largest fragment decreases sharply for collision velocities & 11.5 ms\u22121, thus\nthis is the region where fragmentation takes place. We expect\nthat this fragmentation boundary will change depending on a\nnumber of other parameters such as impact parameter and mass\nratio (Blum & M\u00fcnch 1993), porosity, and the rotation of the\ndust aggregates. Further investigation into the factors that determine the fragmentation boundary is crucial to ultimately understand under what conditions fragments may grow to planetesimal sizes. It is important to note that to decrease the computational expense, the SPH particles that move out of a radius of\n20 m are removed from the simulation. Therefore, the total mass\nat the end of the higher velocity simulations is smaller than the\ninitial mass. However, the total mass removed from the simulation is \u223c 2% in the highest velocity simulation.\nFigure 5 shows how the mass of the second largest fragment\nvaries. For low collision velocities, it is evident that bouncing\noccurs and the projectile, whose mass is indicated by the dashed\nline in Fig. 5, appears as the second largest fragment with unaltered or slightly increased mass in the final distribution. For\nhigher collision velocities, the projectile sticks to the target and\nno second largest fragment results, which is indicated by vanishing masses in this regime. As the velocity further increases,\nthe resulting mass of the second largest fragment increases again\nbut is smaller than the projectile mass, which indicates fragmentation. The increase is followed by a sharp decrease in the mass\nof the largest fragment. These simulations, which are reasonably\nclose to the sticking-fragmentation boundary not only cause the\ntwo aggregates to fragment, but also cause mass to be transferred\n9\n\n\fRalf J.

The broad categorisation into bouncing (open triangles), sticking (closed triangles),\nand fragmentation (open squares) can be identified by masses\nof the second largest fragments being approximately the projectile mass (dashed line), nearly vanishing, and smaller than the\nprojectile mass, respectively. For the fragmenting collisions, the\nmass of the second largest fragment initially increases with collision velocity. However, at higher collision velocities, the fragment mass decreases because of the collision nature of the simulations.\nmulative mass distribution of the fragments is often described\nby a power-law\n!\u03ba\nZ mf\nX\nmf\nn(m)m dm =\nmf =\nmcum (mf ) =\n,\n(11)\n\u03bcpw\n0\nm <\u03bc\nf\n\nFig. 4.

The collision\nwith 11.5 ms\u22121 results in the growth of the target but also a large\nchunk does break off such that pure sticking does not occur. The\nsituation is adequately mapped with the appearance of a second\nlargest fragment. For 12.5 ms\u22121 the target breaks apart and the\npower-law population becomes as significant as the largest fragment. The transition from sticking to fragmentation occurs in\nbetween the presented collision velocities.\nbetween the target and projectile. At higher velocities still, the\nimpact is sufficiently violent for the second largest fragment to\nalso decrease sufficiently.\nFigure 3 shows that as the collision velocity increases, the\ncontribution to the mass from the power-law population also increases. As an outcome of pre-planetesimal collisions, the cu10\n\npw\n\nwhere n(m) dm is the number of fragments within the mass range\n[m, m+dm], mf is the fragment mass, and \u03bcpw is the most massive\nmember of the power-law population.

For higher fragment masses mf , a power-law fit can be obtained that describes\nthe mass distribution of the power-law population. As the velocity increases, the slope of the power-law decreases. This is\nbecause at higher collision velocities, the destruction of the dust\naggregates is more violent and a larger number of smaller fragments results. At low fragment masses, it is currently unclear\nwhether the deviation from the power-law distribution is physical, or whether it is a result of a low number of SPH particles\n(. 100) per fragment. We note that this deviation is also seen in\nthe experimental results of G\u00fcttler et al. (2010).\nWe now consider how much compaction takes place in each\nof the simulations by considering the resulting filling factors of\nthe various populations. Figure 7 shows the average filling factor\nof the largest fragment, \u03c61 , compared to the initial filling factor.\nAs the velocity increases, the compaction also increases, causing\nthe filling factor to increase with velocity.

The curve resembles the FermiDirac shape of the compressive strength relation (Eq. 5), which\ndirectly links the dynamic pressure to the obtained filling factor. We note that the appearance of fragmenting events coincides\nwith the largest fragment reaching a filling factor close to the\nmaximum filling factor. This suggests that fragmentation sets in\nwhen the material is maximally compressed. Furthermore, we\nstress that the transition of the filling factor is smooth right from\nthe low velocity (bouncing) collisions, through to the medium\nvelocity (sticking) collisions to the high velocity (fragmentation)\ncollisions. For simulations with higher initial filling factors, we\nexpect there to be a direct transition between the bouncing and\nfragmentation regimes, as discussed in Section 4.3.\nThe transition is particularly important because for planet\nformation, we are primarily concerned with the evolution of the\nlargest fragment. This demonstrates that our model can quantitatively capture the results of the collisions over a wide region\nof velocity parameter space. Our preliminary results for the second largest fragment suggest that only a small amount of compaction takes place for the second largest fragment in low velocity bouncing simulations such that the final filling factor is very\nclose to the initial filling factor, while for high velocity fragmentation simulations, a large amount of compaction takes place resulting in filling factors close to the maximum value of 0.58.\nAdditional investigations will be carried out in a future study.\nFigure 8 shows the average, maximum, and minimum filling factors of the power-law population. At higher velocities\nwhen more violent fragmentation occurs, the spread in the filling factor is greater than at lower velocities. This suggests that\nat lower velocities, fragments may be chipped off without too\nmuch change to their compaction, whereas in the more violent\n11\n\n\fRalf J.

As the collision velocity increases, the number of fragments increases. For higher\ncollision velocities, the majority of fragments have lower filling\nfactors than the original value (dotted line).\n\ncases with higher collision velocities, the fragments may become\ncompacted before being chipped off or rupture because the plastic flow occurs where parts of the dust are stretched before being ripped off. Figure 9 shows the filling factor distribution of\nthe power-law populations resulting from the simulations with\n17.5, 25.0, and 27.5 ms\u22121. As the collision velocity increases, the\nnumber of fragments increases. In particular, most of the particles have filling factors smaller than the initial value of 0.35.\nThis suggests that during the collision, fragments are ripped off\ninstead of being compressed before breaking apart.\nFinally, we explore the contributions to the total energy (normalised by the initial energies) from the different populations.\nThe total energy is the sum of the energy stored in translation, rotation, and vibration. Figure 10 shows that at low velocities the major energy contribution comes from the largest\nfragment, while at higher velocities the contribution from the\npower-law population becomes somewhat equally significant (at\n\u223c 12.5 ms\u22121) and even more so at even higher velocities. At\nlow velocities, the energy is stored in elastic deformation and released into kinetic energy again so that a smaller fraction of the\ninitial energy is dissipated. As the velocity increases plastic deformation occurs causing energy dissipation. At even higher velocities, though energy is still dissipated (since bonds are broken\nin the fragmentation process), the dissipated energy as a fraction of the initial energy due to bonds being broken is not as\nlarge as the energy dissipation due to plastic deformation. For\nvery high impact velocities, a considerable amount of energy is\nstored in the sub-resolution population. Figure 11 shows the absolute energy dissipated at each collision velocity as well as the\ninitial energy. The total amount of energy dissipated increases\nsmoothly with increasing velocity, irrespective of the bouncing,\nsticking, or fragmentation regime. We note that in these exam12\n\nFig. 10.

Geretshauser et al.: The four-population model\n\nples, the final rotational energies are not very significant because\nthe collisions are head-on. The difference between the rotational\nand translational energies will become more important in simulations with non-zero impact parameters.\nWe have presented here the results of a small number of\nsimulations, which show that transitions between the bouncing,\nsticking, and fragmentation regions occur and that the results of\npre-planetesimal collisions can be described quantitatively. Our\nstudy could be extended to explore a vast parameter space of inputs. Our model has been shown not only to encompass previous\nqualitative models (Sec. 4) but also provide an alternative model\nthat focuses on the quantitative outcome of pre-planetesimal collisions. Furthermore, the model can provide an accurate input\ninto global models, which may then carry out detailed calculations of pre-planetesimal collisions. In addition, this model provides a powerful aid to determine the region of parameter space\nthat allows growth of pre-planetesimals to occur.\n\n6. Discussion and outlook\nWe have demonstrated that our SPH code, extended and calibrated for the simulation of porous SiO2 dust, is capable of reproducing all sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation types that\nappear in collision experiments with macroscopic porous dust\naggregates. In addition to the quantitatively correct simulation of laboratory benchmark experiments (G\u00fcttler et al. 2009,\nGeretshauser et al. 2010), this consolidates the validity of the applied porosity model and shows its readiness for the application\nin the field of investigating pre-planetesimal collisions. Since the\ncontinuum approach of the SPH method does not place an upper\nbound on the aggregate size, collision data of a parameter space\nthat have been inaccessible so far in laboratory experiments can\nnow be provided for further use in global coagulation models.\nFor this transfer, a suitable mapping of collision data has\nto be chosen, which is accurate enough to quantitatively capture the most important features of any combination of sticking,\nbouncing, and fragmentation and simple enough to be implementable in global coagulation models. We have attempted to\nmap our simulation data to the categorisation by G\u00fcttler et al.\n(2010), which was the most elaborate collision model previously\navailable. On the one hand, the distinction between four sticking, two bouncing, and three fragmentation types introduces a\nconsiderable amount of complexity caused by distinguishing between a mixture of qualitative and quantitative attributes and by\nadhering to a distinct classification of these events. On the other\nhand, we have found a collision outcome that could not clearly\nbe attributed to one of the proposed categories.\nBecause of this ambiguity, we have proposed a new model,\nwhich is based on quantitative aspects. For this purpose, we have\ndivided the set of fragments of a collision into four populations:\nthe largest and second largest fragment are described by distinct\nvalues for the characteristic quantities of mass, filling factor, and\nkinetic energy to name only a few. The power-law population\nis described by distributions and the sub-resolution population\nby average values of the characteristic quantities. The largest\nfragment indicates growth or erosion, the second largest fragment accounts for bouncing, the power-law population quantitatively describes the amount of fragmentation, and the subresolution population gives an upper limit for smaller fragments,\nwhich are not captured because of insufficient resolution. Since\nthe SPH code is not restricted to small aggregate sizes, the importance of the sub-resolution population becomes significant\nfor aggregate collisions between objects of approximately metre size and more. For growth models that rely on the sweeping\n\nup of small particles (Teiser & Wurm 2009), the sub-resolution\npopulation also plays an important role. We have demonstrated\nthat this model in general encompasses the model proposed by\nG\u00fcttler et al. (2010) but is also capable of capturing intermediate\nevents.\nFinally we have applied the new model to map data for\nhead-on collisions of aggregates with intermediate (\u03c6 = 0.35)\nporosity and varying impact velocity. We have shown that the\nbroad sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation categorisation can\nstill be found in the four-population model. But in addition, we\nhave also shown that continuous transitions in the variation in\nthe mass of the largest fragment, the filling factor, and the final kinetic energy of the fragments with collision velocity exhibit a more quantitative description. The ability to capture these\ntransitions justifies the design of the four-population model and\ndemonstrates its descriptive power.\nDespite its narrow parameter range, we can draw the following conclusions from the velocity study of Sec. 5. For the transition between bouncing and sticking, we find a threshold velocity\nof \u223c 1 ms\u22121 and that the transition from sticking to fragmentation lies between 11.5 and 12.5 ms\u22121. Since our initial filling factor \u03c6 = 0.35 is close to the critical filling factor 0.4, which separates porous from compact aggregates in G\u00fcttler et al. (2010),\nour findings cannot be directly compared to their results. For\ncollisions between equally sized highly porous and very compact aggregates, they found a direct transition from bouncing to\nfragmentation at \u223c 1 ms\u22121 . However, for collisions between a\ncompact target and a porous projectile of equal size they find\na bouncing-sticking transition at 1 ms\u22121 and a transition from\nsticking to no mass gain at 9.4 ms\u22121 . These thresholds resemble our findings for intermediate porosity very well. Our results for fragmenting collisions indicate that the power-law index of the fragment mass distribution is velocity dependent. This\nis supported by the collection of laboratory fragmentation data\n(Mathis et al. 1977, Davis & Ryan 1990, Blum & M\u00fcnch 1993,\nG\u00fcttler et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is physically reasonable that\nin more violent collisions the fraction of smaller fragments increases. This suggests a velocity-dependent power-law index.\nWe note that the results presented in Sec. 5 are valid for collisions between homogeneous aggregates of intermediate porosity. Increasing inhomogeneity might affect the presented threshold velocities. Furthermore, rotation of the largest and second\nlargest fragments might cause them to fall apart beyond the simulated time, an outcome that eventually affects their final size.\nThe results presented here, in particular for fragmenting collisions, are based on one simulation for each collision velocity.\nAlthough we do not expect a large variation in outcome because\nof the symmetry given by a head-on collision of two spheres,\na profound statistical investigation has to be carried out. It remains to be investigated whether the deviation of the power-law\nmass distribution from a power-law for low fragment masses is a\nnumerical or physical effect. Despite these drawbacks, we have\nbeen able to demonstrate the applicability and functionality of\nthe four-population model by means of our simulation results.\nDespite increased experimental efforts, only small spots of\nthe required parameter space of pre-planetesimal collisions are\nactually covered by empirical data. Vast regions of these maps\nremain terra incognita and collision data for pre-planetesimal\nsizes larger than centimetre are missing.\nWith both a code calibrated for the simulation of preplanetesimals (Geretshauser et al. 2010) and the four-population\nmodel as an adequate mapping model, we have established a basis for profoundly investigating all aspects of pre-planetesimal\ncollisions and transferring acquired data to global dust coagu13\n\n\fRalf J.

In future studies, these tools can be utilised to\ngenerate a catalogue of pre-planetesimal collisions. The fourpopulation model will be applied to investigate how the collision\nbehaviour depends on important parameters such as aggregate\nporosity and inhomogeneity, mass ratio of the collision partners,\nimpact velocity, impact parameter, and rotation. Furthermore,\nwe will assess the statistics of our fragmentation results.\n\nAcknowledgements. R.J.G. and R.S. wish to thank C. G\u00fcttler, M. Krause, and\nJ.
