If M\u2217 is a simplicial monoid, let U M\u2217 denote the simplicial group\nobtained by applying the functor U degreewise. In his paper [4], D Puppe\nattributes the following conjecture to J C Moore and proves various special\ncases of it.\nConjecture If M\u2217 is a simplicial monoid such that \u03c00 (|M\u2217 |) is a group, then\ngroup completion induces a homotopy equivalence\n|M\u2217 | \u2212\u2192 |U M\u2217 |.\nWe will give a simple explicit counterexample to this conjecture below.\nLemma There is a discrete monoid P whose classifying space BP has the\nhomotopy type of S 2 .\nProof This follows immediately from a theorem of D MacDuff [3] (also proved\nin [2]), which shows that any connected CW homotopy type can be realized as\nthe classifying space of a discrete monoid. However we will use the following\nexplicit example: let P be the 5 element monoid consisting of the unit 1 together with elements {xij | i, j = 1, 2} which multiply according to the rule\nxij xkl = xil . Since the elements xij are idempotent,\n\u03c01 (BP ) = U P = 1.\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\fZbigniew Fiedorowicz\n\n34\nZ[P ]\n\nWe then compute that H\u2217 (BP ) = T or\u2217 (Z, Z) = H\u2217 (S 2 ) using the following\nprojective resolution of right Z[P ] modules\n0 \u2212\u2192 Z[P1 ] \u2295 Z[P2 ] \u2212\u2192 Z[P ] \u2212\u2192 Z[P1 ] \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere Pi = {xi1 , xi2 }, the first map is given by inclusion, the second map is\nleft multiplication by x11 \u2212 x12 , and the third map is the restriction of the\naugmentation.\n\nTheorem There is a connected noncontractible simplicial monoid M\u2217 such\nthat the group completion\n|M\u2217 | \u2212\u2192 |U M\u2217 |\nis null homotopic.\nProof Let Mk denote the k -fold free product (ie, coproduct in the category of\nmonoids) of the monoid P with itself. Define the 0-th and last face map to be\nthe homorphism which kills the first, respectively last free summand, and for\nremaining i, let the i-th face be the i-th codiagonal. Define the i-th degeneracy\nto be the inclusion which misses the i + 1-st free summand. It is easy to check\nthat these specifications define a simplicial monoid M\u2217 .\nLet BM\u2217 be the simplicial topological space whose space of k -simplices is the\nclassifying space BMk . Then BM\u2217 has a simplicial subspace S\u2217 , whose space of\nk -simplices is the k -fold wedge of BP with itself. The first and last face drop the\nfirst and last wedge summand respectively, whereas the middle faces are given\nby fold maps. The degeneraces are given by inclusions of wedge summands.\nSince everything in degrees > 1 is degenerate, the geometric realization of\nthis simplicial space is the suspension \u03a3BP \u2243 \u03a3S 2 = S 3 . As is shown in [2,\nTheorem 4.1], the inclusion S\u2217 \u2282 BM\u2217 is a levelwise homotopy equivalence.\nHence it follows that\nS 3 \u2243 |S\u2217 | \u2243 |BM\u2217 | = B|M\u2217 |.\nSince M0 = 1, \u03c00 |M\u2217 | = 0 is a group and so\n|M\u2217 | \u2243 \u03a9B|M\u2217 | \u2243 \u03a9S 3 .\n(As noted in [4, page 382], this is an immediate consequence of [1].) Thus M\u2217 is\nnoncontractible. On the other hand, U Mk is the k -fold free product of U P = 1\nwith itself, so U M\u2217 is the trivial simplicial group.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fA counterexample to a group completion conjecture of J C Moore\n\n35\n\nReferences\n[1] A Dold, Die geometrische Realisierung eines schiefen kartesichen Produktes,\nArchiv der Math. 9 (1958) 275\u2013286\n[2] Z Fiedorowicz, Classifying spaces of topological monoids and categories, Am.
