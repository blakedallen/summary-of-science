In order to explain this late time acceleration [8], one can either introduce dark energy, a new form of matter, or modify Einstein's\ngeneral relativity, i.e., the modification of gravity. One simple way to modify general relativity is to promote the Ricci scalar R in the Einstein-Hilbert action into an f (R) function,\nwhich is the so-called f (R) theory [9\u201313]. A viable model of f (R) can generate a late-time\naccelerating expansion of our universe, have the radiation-dominated stage followed by the\nmatter-dominated one [14, 15], and be consistent with the solar-system constraint under\nchameleon mechanism [16\u201323].\nIn [24], Chiba showed that an f (R) model will allow a new scalar degree of freedom. This\ncorresponds to a new scalar mode of gravitational wave besides the ordinary tensor one of\ngeneral relativity. This new scalar mode will be massive and propagate as a longitudinal polarization. Various discussions and predictions about this extra scalar mode of gravitational\nwave have been given in the literature [25\u201332]. However, most of them were concentrated\non either quadratic or inverse-curvature type of f (R) models, which is highly restricted by\nthe observational results [12, 20, 33\u201336]. In the article, we will study gravitational wave in\nviable f (R) models.\nThe mass of the scalar mode of gravitational wave in viable f (R) models could be quite\ndifferent from quadratic and inverse-curvature ones. In vacuum, it will be of the order of\nthe Hubble constant because all viable f (R) models need to have de Sitter points which\nhave a non-zero background curvature Rd about square of the Hubble constant. However,\nwhen gravitational wave propagates in the galaxy region, the local density of dark matter\nand baryonic matter will contribute a tremendous background curvature although it is still\nmuch smaller then curvature generated by star. This background curvature might make\nsome viable f (R) models return to the ordinary GR very fast. Therefore, the scalar mode\nwill become extremely massive in these cases and, hence, prevent the observable propagation\nof the fifth force in our galaxy and solar system. On the other hand, viable f (R) theories\npass the solar-system constraint by means of chameleon mechanism, which do not require\nvery heavy scalar modes by using the thin-shell argument [18, 21]. In these models, the\n2\n\n\fscalar modes may still be detectable.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the field equations and linearizations in f (R) theories and demonstrate the modifications of gravitational waves. We\napply the analysis on two explicit viable f (R) models: exponential gravity and Starobinsky\nones in Sec. III. The results and discussions on the scalar modes of gravitational waves in\nthe inner galaxy region is presented in Sec. IV. Conclusions are given in Sec. V. We use\nunits of kB = c = \u0127 = 1 and the gravitational constant G = MP\u22122l with the Planck mass of\nMP l = 1.22089 \u00d7 1019 GeV .\nII.\n\nGRAVITATIONAL WAVES IN f (R) THEORY\nA.\n\nf (R) Gravity\n\nWe start by considering a general Einstein-Hilbert action\n1\nS= 2\n2\u03ba\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212gf (R) + Sm (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8\u03bc\u03bd ),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere f (R) is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar R, Sm is the action of the matter\npart and \u03ba2 \u2261 8\u03c0G. In the metric formalism, we vary the action (2.1) with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd ,\nand the modified Einstein field equation can be obtained as\n1\nf \u2032 (R)R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 f (R)g\u03bc\u03bd + (g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003 \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd ) f \u2032 (R) = \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere a prime denotes the derivative with respect to R, \u2207\u03bc is the covariant derivative and\n\u0003 = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd is the d'Alembert operator. The trace of the field equation (2.2) gives\nf \u2032 (R)R \u2212 2f (R) + 3\u0003f \u2032 (R) = \u03ba2 T,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere T = g \u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03c1 + 3a2 P is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, and a\nis the scale factor.\nFor f (R), the de Sitter stage is a vacuum solution with a positive constant background\ncurvature Rd , which is assumed to be homogeneous and static. Consequently, one has\n\u2207\u03bc f \u2032 (Rd ) = 0 and f \u2032 (Rd )Rd = 2f (Rd ).\nMoreover, from Eq. (2.2), the Ricci tensor satisfies R\u03bc\u03bd |Rd = g\u03bc\u03bd Rd /4.\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fB.\n\nThe Weak-field Approximation\n\nIn order to investigate gravitational wave in f (R) theories, we need to study the linearized\ntheory of f (R) gravity. Consider a small perturbation from the FRW metric:\ng\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere |h\u03bc\u03bd | \u226a 1 is the perturbation and g \u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, a2 , a2 , a2 ) is the FRW background\nmetric. If the evolution of the system is much shorter than Hubble time, we can approximate\nthe background spacetime to be nearly the Minkowski one with g \u03bc\u03bd \u2248 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nWe keep the theory to be the first order in h\u03bc\u03bd and neglect terms higher than O (h2 ). Thus,\nthe inverse of the metric tensor is given by\ng \u03bc\u03bd = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(2.6)\n\nNote that all indices are raising and lowering by the background metric g \u03bc\u03bd . In the metric\nformalism, the perturbation of connection is\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b4\u0393\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 = g \u03b3\u03bc \u2202\u03b2 h\u03b1\u03bc + \u2202\u03b1 h\u03bc\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc h\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 2h\u03bc\u03bd \u0393\u0304\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u0393\u0304\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the unperturbed connection. The only non-vanishing components of \u0393\u0304\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 are\n\u0393\u0304ij0 = \u0393\u0304i0j = H\u03b4ji\n\nand \u0393\u03040ij = a2 H\u03b4ij ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere H \u2261 \u0227/a is the Hubble constant. The deviation of the Ricci tensor from the background curvature is [37]\n\u03b4R\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2202\u03bc \u03b4\u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2 \u03b4\u0393\u03bc\u03b1\u03bc + \u0393\u0304\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4\u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc + \u0393\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc \u03b4\u0393\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u0304\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc \u03b4\u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b4\u0393\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc .\nC.\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe Scalar Mode hf\n\nThe different between gravitational waves in f (R) and general relativity is that it contains\nan extra scalar degree of freedom in f (R). This comes from the non-vanishing trace of the\nfield equation. Eq. (2.3) can be viewed as equation of motion for a scalar field \u03a6. By the\nidentifications [38, 39]\n\u03a6 \u2192 f \u2032 (R) and\n\ndVef f\n2f (R) \u2212 f \u2032 (R)R \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03c1\n\u2192\n,\nd\u03a6\n3\n4\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fwe obtain the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field \u03a6:\n\u0003\u03a6 =\n\ndVef f\n.\nd\u03a6\n\n(2.11)\n\nIn order to have a stable perturbation of spacetime, we must require the background scalar\n\u03a60 to stay at the stable minimum of the effective potential Vef f , i.e.,\ndVef f\n=0\nd\u03a6\n\n(2.12)\n\nd2 Vef f\n> 0.\nd\u03a62\n\n(2.13)\n\nand\n\nIn vacuum, Eq. (2.12) just gives us the condition for the de-Sitter point curvature (2.4),\nwhile Eq. (2.13) requires the mass of the scalar mode to be positive.\nPerturbing the trace of the field equation (2.3) with a nonzero constant background\ncurvature R0 which satisfies Eq. (2.12) yields\n3\u0003\u03b4f \u2032 + R0 \u03b4f \u2032 + f \u2032 (R0 )\u03b4R \u2212 2\u03b4f = 0.\n\n(2.14)\n\nUsing the relations \u03b4f = f \u2032 (R0 )\u03b4R and \u03b4f \u2032 = f \u2032\u2032 (R0 )\u03b4R, we obtain the massive wave equation\nfor the scalar mode [27, 30]\n\u0003hf = m2s hf ,\nwhere hf \u2261 \u03b4f \u2032 /f \u2032 (R0 ) is the field of the scalar mode and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 f \u2032 (R0 )\n2\n\u2212 R0\nms =\n3 f \u2032\u2032 (R0 )\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\nis the mass squared of it. Note that m2s = Vef\u2032\u2032 f (\u03a6) [19]. For any viable f (R) model, the\ncondition m2s > 0 is needed for the stability of the cosmological perturbation and to prevent\nthe field from being a tachyon [33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 41].\nFor the FRW metric, Eq.

To\nillustrate the solution of Eq. (2.17), we take the de Sitter universe with a constant H. In\nthis case, the solution is a damped plane wave\n3\nhf = A(~k)e\u2212 2 Ht exp (iq \u03bc x\u03bc ) ,\n\n5\n\n(2.18)\n\n\fwhere q \u03bc \u2261 (\u03c9m , ~k), \u03c9m =\n\nq\n~k 2 /a2 + m2 \u2212 9 H 2 is the angular frequency and A(~k) is the\ns\n4\n\namplitude. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we take a = 1 and neglect the\ndamping effect as ~k 2 /a2 \u226b H 2 . As a result, Eq.

We can see that ms is the cutoff frequency of the scalar mode of\n\ngravitational wave. For \u03c9m < ms , the wave vector becomes imaginary. The waveform is an\nexponential decay in distance, i.e., hf \u221d exp(\u2212~k * ~x). Thus, the scalar will not propagate in\nspace below the cutoff frequency.

In what follows, we will\nconcentrate on the scalar mode of gravitational wave.\n\nIII.\n\nGRAVITATIONAL WAVES IN VIABLE f (R) MODELS\n\nThe conditions for a cosmological viable f (R) model include (i) the positivity of the effective gravitational coupling, (ii) the stability of cosmological perturbations [36, 40, 41, 43],\n(iii) the stability of the late-time de-Sitter point [14, 44\u201346], (iv) the asymptotic behavior to\n\u039bCDM at the high curvature regime, (v) the solar system constraint, and (vi) the constraint\nfrom the violation of the equivalence principle [18, 19, 21]. The typical examples of the\nviable f (R) models are Hu-Sawicki [19], Starobinsky [36], Tsujikawa [22] and exponential\ngravity models [47]. To illustrate our results, we will concentrate on the exponential and\nStarobinsky models. Our study can be easily extended to other viable models.\nUsually a viable f (R) model can use chameleon mechanism to pass the constraints from\nthe solar-system and equivalence principle [18, 19, 21]. In this case, a light-mass scalar is\nallowed by introducing the thin shell condition. As a result, the mass of the scalar mode\ndoes not have to be very heavy [18].\n\nA.\n\n\u039bCDM\n\nWe can take the cosmological constant model or the \u039bCDM model as a special case of\nf (R) with\nf (R) = R \u2212 2\u039b,\nwhere \u039b is the cosmological constant.\n8\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fIn this case, the mass of the scalar mode is infinite, i.e., m2s = \u221e, which requires infinite\nlarge energy to excite the scalar mode. Clearly, there is no scalar mode in the \u039bCDM model.\nAlthough the de Sitter curvature Rd is not zero, i.e.,\nRd = 4\u039b\n\n(3.2)\n\n(\u039bCDM) ,\n2\n\nthe contribution from Rd is negligible because \u039b \u2248 H02 \u2248 (10\u221233 eV ) , where H0 is the\npresent Hubble parameter.\n\nB.\n\nExponential Gravity\n\nThe exponential gravity has been studied intensively in the literature [22, 47\u201354]. The\nform of f (R) in the exponential gravity model is given by\n\u0001\nf (R) = R \u2212 \u03b2RS 1 \u2212 e\u2212R/RS ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere RS is the characteristic curvature scale and \u03b2 is a model parameter. The viable\nconditions are satisfied when \u03b2 > 1 and RS > 0 [47, 52]. The feature is that it is free from\nthe fine tuning problem and it has only one parameter more than the \u039bCDM model.\nNow we will first investigate the de-Sitter curvature Rd in the model. The first and second\nderivatives of f (R) with respect to R are\nf \u2032 (R) = 1 \u2212 \u03b2e\u2212R/RS\n\nand f \u2032\u2032 (R) =\n\n\u03b2 \u2212R/RS\ne\n.\nRS\n\n(3.4)\n\nAccording to the condition for the de-Sitter curvature (2.4), Rd satisfies\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 \u03b2e\u2212Rd /RS Rd = 2Rd \u2212 2\u03b2RS 1 \u2212 e\u2212Rd /RS .\n\n(3.5)\n\nDefining x \u2261 Rd /RS , Eq. (3.5) becomes\n\nx = 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2e\u2212x (x + 2) .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe numerical solutions for this equation are shown in Fig. 1. The factor e\u2212x (x + 2)\ndecreases very fast when \u03b2 > 1, which is generally required by the viable condition for the\nexponential gravity. Therefore, we can obtain the asymptotic solution of x for a large \u03b2:\nx = 2\u03b2\n\nfor \u03b2 \u226b 1.\n9\n\n(3.7)\n\n\f10\n\nx=Rd \u0090RS\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u0392\n\nFigure 1.

However, we will show that in the presence\nof matter density, the scalar mode might not be able to exist in these viable f (R) models.\nConsider a scalar mode of gravitational wave propagating within our Galaxy halo. The local\nhomogeneous density of dark matter and baryonic matter is roughly \u03c1 \u2248 10\u221224 g/cm3. If we\ntake this matter density into our analysis, it will give a large contribution to the background\ncurvature compared to the vacuum de Sitter curvature. (The ratio of the matter density \u03c1\nto de Sitter curvature Rd is about \u03ba2 \u03c1/Rd \u2243 \u03ba2 \u03c1/4\u039b \u2248 105 .) In this case, the condition for\nthe background curvature R0 (2.4) should be modified as\nf \u2032 (R0 )R0 = 2f (R0 ) \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03c1,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere R0 is the background curvature with matter. Note that for viable f (R) models, the\nsolutions to Eq. (4.1) can be approximated as R0 \u2243 \u03ba2 \u03c1 at the high curvature regime.\nIn the case of the exponential gravity (3.3), Eq. (4.1) gives\nx = 2\u03b2 + r \u2212 \u03b2e\u2212x (x + 2) ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere x \u2261 R0 /RS and r \u2261 \u03ba2 \u03c1/RS are the ratios of the background curvature and matter\ndensity to RS , respectively. Since \u03b2RS \u223c\n= 2\u039b from (3.9), we find that the solution of Eq.\n(4.2) is extremely large,\nx\u2243r\u2243\n\n\u03ba2 \u03c1\n\u2243 2 \u00d7 105 \u03b2,\nRd /2\u03b2\n13\n\n(4.3)\n\n\f10-9\n10-15\n\nms 2 HeV2 L\n\n10-21\n10-27\n10-33\n\n\u039b=4\n\u039b=3\n\n10-39\n\n\u039b=2\n\u039b=1\n\n10-45\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nn\n\nFigure 6. m2s versus n in the Starobinsky model with matter density \u03c1 = 10\u221224 g/cm3 and \u03bbRc \u223c\n= 2\u039b.\n\nwhich just leads to R0 \u2243 \u03ba2 \u03c1. Thus, in the exponential gravity, the mass of the scalar mode\nwill become an extreme in the galaxy region:\n\nms \u2248\n\ns\n\n2\u039b 2\u00d7105 \u03b2\ne\n\u2248 \u221e.\n3\u03b2 2\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe corresponding cutoff frequency \u03c9m is also infinite. As a result, it is almost impossible to\ndetect this scalar mode within our Galaxy under the exponential gravity scenario. Moreover,\nfor any source that is massive enough to generate gravitational waves, we expect them to\nlay in the region with density higher than the baryonic/dark matter density 10\u221224 g/cm3.\nTherefore, the scalar mode will not have the chance to propagate from the source in the\nexponential gravity.\nIn the case of the Starobinsky model (3.12), the situation is quite different. The scalar\nmode of gravitational wave can have a light mass in the galaxy region. The minimum bound\nof the scalar mode mass is ms & 10\u221224 eV when \u03c1 = 10\u221224 g/cm3 . The corresponding cutoff\nfrequency is quite small fm & 10\u22129 Hz. This feature will allow the propagation of the scalar\nmode inside the galaxy. Hence, detecting the scalar mode in the Starobinsky model will be\npossible. In Fig. 6, we depict the mass squared versus the model parameter n with different\nfixed values of \u03bb, where we have used \u03bbRc \u223c\n= 2\u039b. The scalar mode can still be very heavy\nwhen the index n goes to a large value, but the mass dependence on the parameter \u03bb is not\nquite significant.\n14\n\n\fV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have discussed gravitational waves in viable f (R) theories. Using the weak field approximation on the field equation, we have confirmed that f (R) will give an extra massive\nscalar mode besides the ordinary tensor mode in the standard GR. We have explicitly investigated the situations of the extra scalar mode of gravitational wave in the exponential\ngravity and Starobinsky models of the viable f (R) gravity theories. In vacuum, we have\nshown that the typical mass squared of the scalar mode is in the order of the de-Sitter\ncurvature m2s \u223c Rd \u2248 10\u221266 eV 2 in both models.\nHowever, in the galaxy region, the situations will be different if we consider the background curvature by the presence of the galactic density. The small matter density \u03c1 =\n10\u221224 g/cm3 is still 105 larger than the de-Sitter curvature Rd in both models. In the exponential gravity, since the mass of the scalar mode in galaxy is undetectable large, it will be\nunable to measure a gravitational wave. On the other hand, in the Starobinsky model, the\nmass can be much smaller with its lower bound in galaxy being about 10\u221224 eV (or 10\u22129 Hz).\nTherefore, it is possible to observe the scalar mode of gravitational wave in the Starobinsky\nscenario if there is an astrophysical source which generates this scalar mode. The extreme\ndifference of the scalar mode masses also makes the distinction of f (R) theories from \u039bCDM\npossible by probing this scalar mode of gravitational wave.\nRecently, there is an underway space-based gravitational wave probing experiment, the\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [58]1 , which is a proposed joint mission of the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. It will measure the low-frequency band (10\u22125 to\n1 Hz) of gravitational waves with high signal-to-noise ratio. The gravitational sources within\nthis band [59] include supermassive black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, extrememass-ratio black hole inspirals, galactic compact binaries and some primordial gravitational\nwave sources. It is possible that these sources also generate the scalar mode of gravitational\nwave. Since LISA will be located far from the Earth and other gravitational sources, the\nbackground curvature of it is very low compared to the ground-based experiments, which\nallows the propagation of the scalar mode in some viable f (R). As a result, LISA has a great\nchance to direct detect not only the ordinary gravitational wave but also the clues of the\ndeviation from Einstein's GR by analyzing the scalar mode behavior of gravitational wave.\n1\n\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna, http://sci.esa.int/lisa\n\n15\n\n\fMoreover, if the scalar mode becomes observable, many interesting features in the viable\nf (R) gravity models [12, 60] will appear. We note that other gravitational wave probes, such\nas ASTROD-GW [61] with the sensitivity in the 10\u22127 \u2212 10\u22121 Hz band, may also detect the\nextra scalar mode. It is clear that an observation of the scalar mode with a frequency larger\nthan 10\u22128 Hz by LISA or ASTROD-GW would be associated with the Starobinsky model\nand is rules out the exponential one. Finally, we remark that the scalar mode in a viable\nf (R) cannot be observed by the ground gravitational searches due to the large background\ncurvature.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Professor Wei-Tou Ni for many useful discussions and reading the\nmanuscript.
