The idea of using cosmic ray muons\nfor Muon Tomography (MT) based on the measurement of\nmultiple scattering [1] of atmospheric cosmic ray muons as a\npromising technique to probe threat objects made of high-Z\nmaterial, e.g. uranium or plutonium, and shielded nuclear\nmaterial was originally proposed by a team at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory [2,3]. We propose the use of Gas Electron\nMultiplier (GEM) detectors [4] as the tracking devices for the\nMuon Tomography Station (MTS). GEM detectors are\ncompact, have low mass, and can reach spatial resolutions\ndown to about 50 \u03bcm. Results of Monte Carlo simulation\nstudies on the performance expected from such a compact\nGEM-based MTS were reported previously [5]. In this paper\nwe report the first successful reconstruction and imaging\n\nFigure 1: Triple-GEM Detector.\n\nWe built several 30 cm \uf0b4 30 cm triple-GEM detectors for the\nfirst GEM-based MTS. Details of the GEM detector\nconstruction can be found in Ref. [6]. The design is based on\nthe GEM detectors built by the TERA Foundation [7], which\nare in turn an upgraded version of the GEM detectors for the\nCOMPASS experiment [8] at CERN. All detector components\nand the HV board were produced in the Electronics and PCB\nfacilities at CERN. Systematic HV tests were performed\nbefore and during assembly to monitor the quality of the GEM\nfoils. We assembled seven triple-GEM detectors and one\ndouble-GEM detector at CERN. Fig. 1 shows the picture of\none of our triple-GEM detector on its stand for X-ray testing.\n2.2.

Six of the seven detectors passed\nthe HV test and were consequently operated with an Ar/CO 2\n70:30 gas mixture on an X-ray test bench.

One of the triple-GEM detectors failed the HV test\nunder CO2 with a very high leakage current at a high voltage\nof 2 kV indicating a possible short circuit due to metallic\ncontact. The problem is under investigation.\n3.\n\nGEM-based Muon Tomography Station\n\n3.1. MTS Geometry\nWe built a simple mechanical stand for the MTS that could\naccommodate several GEM detectors with 30 cm \uf0b4 30 cm\nactive area in each of the top and bottom tracking stations. For\nthe first data run, a total of four triple-GEM detectors used in\nthe MTS with two in the top station and two in the bottom\nstation (see Fig. 3). The distance between the detectors was\n9.45 cm as dictated by the size and routing of the readout\ncabling; the gap between the top and the bottom station was\n10.1 cm. A thin press-board plate was inserted between the\ntwo tracking stations, at the center of the MTS (z=0) to\nsupport the targets. This setup, which we refer to as a\n\"minimal\" MTS, does not accommodate detectors on the side.\n\nFor the readout of the x and y strips of the GEM detectors, we\nused eight Gassiplex front end (FE) cards [9]. Each FE card\nhas 96 channels and uses 96-pin SAMTEC input connectors.\nThe GEM detector readout board has 768 strips connected to\nsix 128-pin Panasonic connectors in each x and y direction.\nWith eight Gassiplex FE cards and four GEM detectors in the\nMTS, we could only instrument one Panasonic connector each\nin x and y per detector (2 \u00d7 128 strips readout), which means\nthat we were able to read out a central area of 5 \uf0b4 5 cm2 for\neach of the GEM detectors. We produced an adapter PCB to\ninterface the 96-pin SAMTEC connectors of the FE cards to\nthe 128-pin Panasonic connectors on the GEM detectors. We\nneeded to gang together pairs of strips for 64 of the 128 strips\nin order to match the 128 input strips on the detector to the 96\nchannels of the FE cards. For the external trigger, the\ncoincidence signal of two 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 plastic scintillators with\nPMT readout was used, with one scintillator placed just above\nthe upper GEM of the top station and the other below the\nlower GEM of the bottom station. The two counters were\ncarefully aligned with the active area of the GEM detectors in\nthe MTS.\n3.3. Data Acquisition System\nThe DAQ system, based on the CAST Micromegas detector\nDAQ [10], was composed of:\n\uf0b7 a VME crate with a CAEN Controller card VME-MXI2\n[11], four V550 CAEN Readout Analog Multiplexed\nSignal (CRAMS) modules [11] to digitize the analog\nsignals from the FE cards, one V551 CAEN sequencer\ncard [11] that receives the trigger signal, produces the\ncontrol signals (Clock, Track/Hold, Clear) for the FE\n\n\fProc.

The offline software is also used to\nmonitor the performance of the MTS.

Reconstruction of the various scenarios\nWe ran a point-of-closest-approach (POCA) algorithm [12] on\nthe data to reconstruct the scenarios described in section 4.1.\nFig. 5 displays the 3D reconstruction where each point\nrepresents the reconstructed \"interaction point\" of the muon\ndeflected by the target.

Cosmic ray data runs\nWe performed a month-long cosmic ray muon run at CERN in\nApril 2010 with the minimal MTS setup described above, i.e.\nfor an MTS volume defined by a 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 active area of the\nGEM detectors and a 10.1 cm gap between the top and bottom\ntracking station. We took data for four different scenarios at a\ntrigger rate of about 1,000 events per day. This rate given by\nthe small solid angle defined by the two 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 trigger\ncounters is consistent with what we expect from a Monte\nCarlo simulation. Cosmic data were taken for the following\nMTS scenarios:\n\uf0b7 The first run was performed with an empty MTS volume\nfor 2 days (~1,900 events) to evaluate the alignment of the\nfour GEM detectors and the performance of the MTS.\n\uf0b7 The second run was performed for 3 days (~3,000 events),\nwith a 30 \uf0b4 30 \uf0b4 30 mm3 iron (Fe, Z=26) block on a target\nplate located at z = 0 in the MTS volume.\n\uf0b7 The third run was performed for 3.5 days (~3,600 events)\nwith a lead (Pb, Z=82) target block with dimensions 28 \u00d7\n\nFigure 5: 3D reconstruction of the experimental data for the four\nscenarios. The color for each point represents the scattering angle in\ndegree.\n\nThe plots in Fig. 6 show the 2D projections of thick slices in\nthe x-y plane (top view) and y-z plane (side view) of the MTS\nvolume for the four scenarios. For the top view, the MTS\nvolume is divided into 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 20 mm3 voxels with the slice at\nz=0 shown. For the side view, the MTS volume is divided into\n2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10 mm3 voxels with the slice at x=0 shown. For each\nvoxel, we plot the mean scattering angle <\u03b8> in degree for all\nthose POCA \"points\" reconstructed inside that voxel. The\nwhite open squares, rectangles, and circles represent the actual\ndimensions and nominal locations of the targets within the\nMTS volume. We can clearly reconstruct, i.e. detect, and\nimage these rather small targets. The voxels with high angles\nare located inside the targets, especially for the Ta and Pb\ntargets. The circular Ta shape and the rectangular Pb shape as\nwell as their dimensions are reproduced.\nWe run Monte Carlo (MC) simulation using the GEANT4\ntoolkit [13] for the four MTS scenarios with statistics\nequivalent to the data and compare the reconstruction of the\nscenarios for the simulation with our experimental data.\n\n\fProc.

The measured mean\nangles are somewhat higher in data than in MC because the\ntracks from muons with small angles are more likely to\nreconstruct the \"interaction\" POCA point outside the voxel in\nwhich the actual interaction took place because of detector\nmisalignment and poor spatial resolution as we previously\ndemonstrated [5].\n5.\n\nFigure 6: 2D reconstruction of experimental data for the four scenarios\nin X-Y slices (top) and Y-Z slices (bottom).

Using several thousand cosmic ray muons\nrecorded with the station, we are able to detect and image\nmedium-Z and high-Z targets (Fe, Pb, Ta) with small volumes\nusing our simple point-of-closest-approach reconstruction\nalgorithm. This demonstrates that GEM-based muon\ntomography is in principle possible.\nThe next step is to fully instrument ten GEM detectors and\nmount them in a cubic-foot size MTS that also features side\ndetectors. We are contributing to the effort made by the CERN\nRD51 collaboration [14] to develop a scalable readout system\n(SRS) [15] to read out all ~15k channels of this planned cubicfoot MTS prototype.\nAcknowledgment & Disclaimer\nWe thank Leszek Ropelewski and the GDD group, Rui de\nOliveira and the PCB production facility, and Miranda Van\nStenis, all at CERN, for their help and technical support with\nthe detector construction.
