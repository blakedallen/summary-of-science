However, the atmosphere imposes serious\nlimits on interferometer sensitivity, via the coherence length (r0 ) and coherence time (t0 ): the length\nand time scale over which atmospheric effects change significantly. At optical and near infrared\nwavelengths, atmospheric phase variations are dominated by the temperature/density fluctuations\nof the dry air component.\nConversely, interferometric observations can yield detailed information on atmospheric turbulence on spatial scales larger than those of single apertures. In order to operate, interferometers\nneed to measure (and correct) both delay and angle fluctuations. The time series of these measurements gives temporal and spatial information on atmospheric turbulence. The correlations in\ndelay fluctuations over a finite baseline length can potentially provide additional information.\nWe used the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) (Colavita et al. 1999) for atmospheric\nmeasurements. PTI has three siderostats (only two of which can be used at one time). It can\noperate at wavelengths of 1.6 and 2.2 \u03bcm, with simultaneous operation possible. All the data\nreported in this paper were taken on a 110 m baseline (oriented 20\u25e6 east of north), at a wavelength\nof 2.2 \u03bcm (2.0\u20132.4 \u03bcm passband). Although the interferometer has a dual star mode (for narrow\nangle astrometry), only data from single star mode was used in this analysis.\nThere were multiple motivations for this study. The first was to better understand the physics\nof atmospheric refractivity fluctuations. The second was to quantify the atmospheric error in astronomical measurements (especially those with an interferometer), and perhaps devise improved\nobservational strategies. The third motivation was to look for instrumental error sources, by searching for deviations from an atmospheric signature.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and data selection\n\n2.1.\n\nInterferometer Delay Data\n\nDuring PTI operation, the position of the optical delay line, relative to a standard fiducial\npoint, is monitored by laser metrology, recorded at 500 Hz, and averaged in post processing to\nmatch the white-light sample time of 10 or 20 msec. The delay line follows a predicted sidereal\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ntrajectory. A correction is supplied by the output of the fringe tracker, which adjusts the delay with\na 5\u201310 Hz closed-loop bandwidth to follow the white-light fringe in the presence of atmospheric\nturbulence and imperfect baseline and astrometric knowledge.\nThe fringe phase is measured for each 10 or 20 msec sample in a broadband, \"white-light\"\nchannel, as well as in each of 5 spectral channels across the band. The white-light phase, which\nhas a high SNR per sample, represents the error of the fringe tracker; by adding the white light\nphase (scaled to delay units) to the measured delay line position, we obtain the total delay at 10 or\n20 msec intervals.\nThe white-light phase measurements are all modulo-2\u03c0 radians; phase unwrapping maintains\ncontinuity during tracking, but undetected unwrapping errors can occur due to low SNR or rapid\natmospheric motion. These are nominally detected and corrected (one cycle at a time) at a lower\nrate, of order 1 Hz, using group delay measurement from the phases measured across the 5 spectral\nchannels (Colavita et al. 1999). While the group delay provides an absolute measurement, the low\ncorrection rate means that some fraction of the data can be off the central white-light fringe, with\nthe fraction growing for poor seeing. We used four selection criteria to minimize such 'cycle slips.'\nFirst, sources with fringes weaker than a threshold value were excluded. Second, only scans with an\naverage of < 1.0 detected fringe lock breaks per 24 s output record were used. This criterion biased\nour results, by excluding approximately one third of the total data: nights (and segments of nights)\nwith noisy atmospheric conditions. However, it was necessary in order to avoid contamination\nfrom instrumental effects. Third, whenever group delay measurements indicated a cycle slip in the\nfringe tracking, 0.5 s of data at that epoch were flagged and not used in the analysis. Fourth,\nsources brighter than a threshold value were not used. Fringe data is recorded when locked on the\nwhite-light fringe, as ascertained by the fringe signal-to-noise ratio. Bright sources could be tracked\non sidelobes of the central fringe with the current implementation of fringe centering.\n\n2.2.\n\nStar Tracker Angle Data\n\nDuring interferometer operations, the angle of each starlight beam was sensed (relative to the\noptical axis on the beam combiner table) every 10 msec. This \"error signal\" was used to drive a\nfast steering mirror, with a closed loop bandwidth of 5 Hz. The fast steering mirror (FSM) position\nwas desaturated into the siderostat positions with a bandwidth of \u2248 0.1 Hz.\nThe three component signal complicated the use of the star tracker data for atmospheric\nmeasurements. Fortunately, the atmospheric timescales of interest were shorter than the timescale\nfor desaturation of the FSMs. It was not feasible to add the error signal to the FSM positions. With\nthe quad-cell sensor used for angle tracking, the gain is a function of the seeing-dependent spot size.\nWhile not an issue for a conservative closed-loop system, this does prevent accurate combination\nof the error with the mirror position to get angle variations at all frequencies. Therefore, we used\nthe FSM positions by themselves, with separate analysis of the error signals in order to set limits\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\non short timescale angle variations.\nWe used star tracker data only during periods when fringes were being tracked (i.e. the time\ngaps in the fringe white light files were used as a flag to edit out similar time periods in the star\ntracker data).\n\n3.\n\nData Analysis\n\n3.1.\n3.1.1.\n\nDelay Data\nSidereal Fit\n\nThe time series of delay (and phase) measurements contained large (tens of meters) geometric\ncomponents, in addition to atmospheric components. To remove the geometric component, we\nsubtracted a least squares sidereal fit from all the data on a source on a given night:\na + b sin(ST) + c cos(ST)\nHere, ST represents sidereal time. By solving for three parameters (a, b, and c), our residuals were\ninsensitive to uncertainties in the length or orientation of the interferometer baseline, or to the zero\npoint in the delay line metrology.\nIn order to avoid removing significant short term (< 100 s) atmospheric signature from our\ndata in the fitting process, we only used sources with multiple scans on the same night. The time\nspan for the sidereal fit was therefore always > 1000 s. Numerical tests showed that a sidereal fit\nover a duration Tfit caused a noticeable suppression in the structure function of the residuals on\ntime scales as short as Tfit /10, with larger effects on longer timescales.\n\n3.1.2.\n\nStructure Functions\n\nUsing the residual (i.e. post sidereal fit) delay/phase time series, structure functions D\u03c4 (\u2206t)\nwere calculated:\nE\nD\n(1)\nD\u03c4 (\u2206t) \u2261 [\u03c4 (t + \u2206t) \u2212 \u03c4 (t)]2\n\nHere \u03c4 (t) is the residual delay at time t, and the <> brackets denote ensemble averaging. With\nobservations scheduled for amplitude visibility measurements (the majority of our data), the scan\nlengths were typically 130 s. One structure function was calculated for each scan. On some nights,\nlong scans (20\u201330 min.) were made, solely for atmospheric measurements. For those scans, structure\nfunctions were calculated for each 3 minute segment of data.\n\nA typical delay structure function is shown in Figure 1. On timescales from 50 msec to \u2248 1 s,\na clean power law slope was seen in the structure function of nearly every (> 90%) scan. On the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nshortest timescales (< 50 msec), the structure function for many scans exhibited power above that\nextrapolated from the slope at longer (50\u2013500 msec) timescales. We interpret this excess power\nas being due to instrumental effects (e.g vibrations). On timescales longer than \u2248 1 s, the slope\nof D\u03c4 decreased, due to some combination of outer scale length and baseline crossing effects (i.e.\nthe product of wind speed and time interval becomes comparable to or greater than the baseline\nlength). The long baseline (110 m) of PTI, compared to that of other optical/IR interferometers,\nhas a longer wind speed crossing time. There is therefore a relatively long time interval (> 1 s)\nover which the fluctuations at the two siderostats are uncorrelated. As discussed later, outer scale\neffects were more important than the effect of a finite baseline length, at least for the four nights\non which we recorded star tracker data from both siderostats, and were able to measure the outer\nscale length.\nAn alternate method of quantifying fluctuation statistics is power spectral density. Structure\nfunctions have the advantage of being unaffected by gaps in the data, and allow a more direct\ncalculation of the dependence of seeing on wavelength, or astrometric precision on baseline length\nand integration time. The comparison between power spectral density and structure functions is\ndiscussed in section 4.3.\n\n3.1.3.\n\nExtracting slope and coherence time\n\nA least squares fit to the slope of D\u03c4 was made for each scan, over the interval 50\u2013500 msec\n(10 msec integration mode) or 60\u2013600 msec (20 msec integration mode). Equal weight was given\nto each logarithmic time interval in the fit. Results from a given scan were not used if the rms\nresidual to the fit was > 0.02 in log-log space, or there was too little data (time span < 100 s or\n> 40% of the data from the span missing). Scans with large residuals did not exhibit a simple\npower law turbulence spectru. As a result, these scans could not be accurately characterized by a\nsingle power law index, and we chose not to use them in further analysis.\nThe two parameters from the fit were the slope and intercept. We wished to derive the\ncoherence time T0,2 , defined as the time interval over which the interferometer phase fluctuations\nhave a variance of 1 radian2 . Our notation follows that in Colavita et al. (1999); the \"2\" refers to\nthe contributions from the two apertures of the interferometer.\nThe variance \u03c3\u03c42 (T ) of delay over a time interval T is (Treuhaft & Lanyi 1987):\n\u03c3\u03c42 (T ) =\n\n1\nT2\n\nIf D\u03c4 (\u2206t) = c0 (\u2206t)\u03b2 ,\n\u03c3\u03c42 (T ) =\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n(T \u2212 \u03c4 )D\u03c4 (t)dt\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nc0 T \u03b2\n(1 + \u03b2)(2 + \u03b2)\n\n(3)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nDelay Structure Function\n\n1999 Night 109\n\n1000\n\n100\n\nTime Interval\nused for Power\nLaw Fit\n\n10\nEffects of baseline crossing\ntime and/or outer scale size\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nTime Interval (seconds)\n\nFig. 1.- Typical delay structure function.

Setting\n\u03b2\nc0 \u03c40,1\n= 2(0.55/2.2)2 , we get\n\u0014\n\u00151/\u03b2\n0.125\n\u03c40,1 (0.55 \u03bcm) =\nT0,2 (2.2 \u03bcm)\n(5)\n(1 + \u03b2)(2 + \u03b2)\nOur data were taken over a range of zenith angles (ZA), up to ZA \u2248 40\u25e6 . The value of D\u03c4 at\nshort time scales for a vertical column of uniform turbulence is expected (on theoretical grounds) to\nvary linearly with the thickness of the column, suggesting that D\u03c4 will be proportional to sec(ZA).\nHowever, if the wind velocity is not perpendicular to the source azimuth, the dependence will be\nmore gradual.\nThe extreme range of the variation in T0,2 from zenith angle variations will be (see eq.[4]) a\nfactor of (sec 40\u25e6 )1/\u03b2 . For the values of \u03b2 measured at PTI (\u03b2 \u2248 1.45), this will be \u2248 1.2. As\nshown in section 4, the range of coherence time was much larger than this, even within one night.\nTherefore, only a small part of the observed variation in T0,2 can be due to the range in observed\nsky directions. The fitted slope should not depend on zenith angle, based on theoretical grounds.\nWe see no dependence in our data.\n\n3.1.4.\n\nContributions from internal seeing\n\nLight from the siderostats is brought into the optics lab via evacuated beam tubes. Within\nthe optics lab, the delay lines operate in air. A \"building within a building\" design (Colavita et al.\n1999) helps to keep this air still and nearly isothermal. A test of the fluctuations within the optics\nlab, including the long delay lines, gave a delay structure function 1000 times smaller than those\non natural stars (M. Swain, private communication). We conclude that refractivity fluctuations\nwithin our instrument gave a negligible contribution to our derived atmospheric parameters.\n\n3.2.\n3.2.1.\n\nStar Tracker Data\n\nStructure Function of Angle Data\n\nThe time series of starlight arrival angle measurements \u03b1x (t) and \u03b1y (t), in directions x and y,\nwere used to derive angular structure functions, D\u03b1x (\u2206t) and D\u03b1y (\u2206t):\nE\nD\n(6)\nD\u03b1x (\u2206t) \u2261 [\u03b1x (t + \u2206t) \u2212 \u03b1x (t)]2\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nSeparate structure functions were calculated for the Fast Steering Mirror positions and for the error\n(i.e. residual) values. Typical FSM angular structure functions are shown in Figure 2. D\u03b1x (\u2206t)\nand D\u03b1y (\u2206t) rise rapidly and then flatten out. The upturn at the longest time scales (> 0.3 s) is\ndue to the desaturation of the FSMs into the siderostats.\nThe structure functions for the star tracker error signals showed a sharp rise up to a constant\n\"plateau\" for all the scans. This plateau was reached at a time scale of 20\u201350 msec, depending on\nthe scan. On time scales longer than \u2248 20 msec (full range 18\u201325 msec), the structure functions of\nthe FSM positions were larger than the structure functions of the error signals. Therefore, the FSM\nangular structure functions (e.g. Figure 2) represent all of the actual angle fluctuations, except for\na small amplitude, rapid component.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nModeling D\u03b1\n\nWe modeled the measured angles as a least squares fit for the wavefront slope across our\napertures, in two (x and y) directions (Sarazin & Roddier 1990).

For sky directions near zenith (as in our observations), the dependence of model\nD\u03b1x (\u2206t) and D\u03b1y (\u2206t) values on wind azimuth is relatively minor: \u00b120% in amplitude and the\ntimescale of the slope break, compared to the values for a 45\u25e6 azimuth. We therefore used an\nazimuth of 45\u25e6 in the calculations. The close agreement between the measured D\u03b1x (\u2206t) and\nD\u03b1y (\u2206t) curves suggests that the true wind azimuth was not near 0\u25e6 or 90\u25e6 (or, more likely, that\nthere was a mix of wind azimuths in the turbulent region of the atmosphere).\n\n3.2.3.\n\nFitting for the wind velocity of the turbulent layers\n\nOnce D\u03c4 (\u2206t) is specified, the only free parameter in modeling D\u03b1x (\u2206t) is the wind velocity,\nneeded to relate the coherence time (T0,2 ) to the coherence length (r0 ), and D\u03c4 (\u2206t) to D\u03c4 (\u2206~x).\nFor a wind velocity of vw in azimuth \u03c6w ,\nA=\nB=\n\np\n\np\n(r cos \u03c6 \u2212 r \u2032 cos \u03c6\u2032 )2 + (r sin \u03c6 \u2212 r \u2032 sin \u03c6\u2032 )2\n\n(r cos \u03c6 + vw \u2206t cos \u03c6w \u2212 r \u2032 cos \u03c6\u2032 )2 + (r sin \u03c6 + vw \u2206t sin \u03c6w \u2212 r \u2032 sin \u03c6\u2032 )2\n\nA grid of model wind velocities was used to test the agreement between theoretical and measured\nangular structure functions. In general, the agreement for a single turbulent flow velocity was poor\n- the slope change in the model was sharper than in the data. Therefore, models with multiple\nlayers (bulk wind velocities) were used. The turbulence fields in different layers were assumed to\nbe independent, so that their contributions to the angular and delay structure functions could be\nadded. Figures 3 and 4 show the agreement between data and model for single and double layer\nmodels, for a scan on 1999, Night 109. Adding even more layers to our models would have resulted\nin slightly better matches to the shapes of the measured structure functions than in Figure 4.\nHowever, it would not have changed the overall scaling mismatch.\nThere was not enough information in the angular structure functions to closely constrain\nthe velocity of each component, but the general shape of the overall velocity distribution was\ndetermined.\nThe overall amplitude scale for the FSM angles is uncertain by at least 20%, enough to account\nfor the discrepancy between data and model seen in Figures 3 and 4 (note that the structure function\nis proportional to the square of the angles). In addition, the model values reflect the average of the\nconditions at the two siderostats.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nAngular Structure Function with Single Layer Model\n10\nx\ny\nmodel\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n4\n\nTime Interval (seconds)\n\nFig. 3.- Angular structure function from 1999 Night 109 with a single layer (2.5 m s\u22121 wind\nvelocity) model.

Table 1 gives a summary of the data volume: number of scans and total time span for each\nnight, along with the mean values of the slope (\u03b2) and coherence time (T0,2 ). For long scans, each\n3 minute segment has been counted in the total in Table 1.\nFigure 5 shows the mean fitted spectral slopes for the nights with \u2265 10 usable scans. The vertical bars represent the 1\u03c3 scatter about the mean for that night. The three dimensional Kolmogorov\nvalue of 5/3 is shown for comparison.\nFigure 6 is a scatter plot of the mean slope and coherence time for each night with \u2265 10 usable\nscans. Figure 7 is a similar plot for all the data, with one point per scan. There appears to be\nno obvious correlation between the slope and coherence time. The lower cutoff at T0,2 \u2248 30 msec\nis a selection effect: for shorter coherence times, there were too many losses of lock to meet our\nselection criteria (or the atmosphere was too noisy for the interferometer to operate at all).\nThe variations in \u03b2 and T0,2 within individual nights did not fit into any obvious pattern.\nFigure 8 shows the variations for nights 62, 223, and 257 in 1999 (this includes the two nights with\nthe largest number of scans, and the two nights with the largest time spans). For most nights,\nthere was no obvious trend in \u03b2 with time. The coherence time varied by factors of 2\u20134, sometimes\non timescales of < 1 hr (e.g. on Night 62). This result is consistent with reports of variations in\nseeing on similar time scales (e.g. Martin et al. 1998).\nAn exponent of \u03b2 in the delay structure function corresponds to an exponent of \u2212(1 + \u03b2) in the\none-dimensional spectrum of delay fluctuations (Armstrong & Sramek 1982). For a Kolmogorov\nspectrum, the power spectrum exponent is \u22128/3.\n\n4.2.\n\nAngle Tracking Data\n\nThere were only four nights with extensive data recorded from both North and South star\ntrackers. Table 2 gives the results of the velocity fitting for those nights. The time variations in\nthe weights of the fitted wind velocities were small (\u223c 10%) within each night.\nThe weights in Table 2 represent the relative contributions to the coherence time (i.e. delay\nvariations). To get the contribution of component i to the coherence length, these weights should\nbe scaled by vi\u2212\u03b2 , where vi is the velocity of component i and \u03b2 is the measured slope of the delay\nstructure function (see Table 1). Therefore, the contributions of low velocity (\u223c 1 m s\u22121 ) turbulent\nflow to r0 are more dominant than suggested by the weights in Table 2.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nSpectral Slope of Delay Fluctuations During 1999\n1.7\n3-D Kolmogorov value\n\nB\n\n1.6\n\n1.5\n\n1.4\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\nBB\n\nmean slope\n\nB\n\nB\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\nB\nBB\n\nB\nB\n\nBB\nB B\n\nB\n\nBB\n\nB\n\nB\nBB\nB\n\nBB\n\nB\n\nBB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nBB\n\nBB\n\nBB\n\nBB\n\nBB\nB\n\n1.3\n\nB\n\nB\n\n1.2\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nNight (UT Day) Number in 1999\n\nFig. 5.- Mean value of spectral slope (\u03b2) for each night in 1999 with 10 or more scans.

Variations in the measured flow velocity (described above)\nwithin individual nights were small. Therefore, variations in T0,2 must primarily reflect variations\nin the turbulence field. As a measure of the total fluctuation amplitude, we used D\u03c4 (50 s): the\ndelay structure function at a time interval of 50 s. This interval is approximately half the length of\nour shortest scans, and is therefore approximately the longest interval over which we can get good\nstatistics for D\u03c4 in one scan. By an interval of 50 s, D\u03c4 had nearly leveled off for most scans.\nFor those scans (on nights 109, 211, 212, and 271) with star tracker data, we can use D\u03c4 (50 s)\nto solve for an outer scale size of the turbulence. For D\u03c4 (\u2206t) = c0 (\u2206t)\u03b2 and a set of velocities vi\nwith weights (fractional contribution to D\u03c4 ) fi , the structure function will saturate at a value:\n\" \u0012 \u0013 #\nX\nL0 \u03b2\n(13)\nfi\nD\u03c4 (max) = c0\nvi\ni\n\nHere L0 is the structure function definition of the outer scale length: the spatial delay structure\nfunction D\u03c4 (d) reaches a maximum value of c0 L\u03b20 . The derived outer scale values, for each scan\nwith dual (north and south) angle tracking data, are shown in Figure 9.\nThe decision to record dual star tracker data on these four nights was not based on the level of\nmeasured turbulence. We therefore expect the results shown in Figure 9 to be representative of the\nconditions during the full set of 64 nights listed in Table 1. However, these results may not apply\nto the nights where the coherence time was too short for us to extract atmospheric parameters. We\nhave no constraints on the outer scale length for those 'noisy' nights.\nAn outer scale length in the refractivity power spectral density is generally represented with\nthe von Karman model (Ishimaru 1978):\n\"\n\n\u03a6N (\u03ba) \u221d \u03ba2 +\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nL0\n\n\u00132 #\u221211/6\n\n(14)\n\nThe spatial frequency \u03ba = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, with \u03bb the wavelength of the fluctuation. For the generalization\nto non-Kolmogorov slopes, the exponent is \u2212(1 + \u03b2/2).\nIn order to obtain the correspondence between the power spectral density outer scale L0 (PSD)\nand the structure function outer scale L0 (D\u03c4 ), equation(14) was first transformed to a refractivity\nstructure function. This refractivity structure function was then numerically integrated to yield a\ndelay structure function. The results on the outer scale correspondence, for three representative\nvalues of \u03b2, are:\nL0 (D\u03c4 ) =\n\n0.94L0 (PSD)\n\n(\u03b2 = 5/3)\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nOuter Scale Length vs. Time\n60\n\n60\n\nB\n\n50\n\n50\n40\n\n40\n\nB\n\n30\n20\n\nB\n\nBB\nB B B BB\nB\n\n10\n0\n10\n\n30\n\nB\nB\n\nBBB B\nB\n\nBB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nBB\nB\n\n20\n\nB\n\n10\n0\n\n10.5\n11\n11.5\nTime (UT hours) Night 109\n\n12\n\n5\n\n5.5\n6\n6.5\nTime (UT hours) Night 211\n\n60\n\n7\n60\n\nB\n\n50\n\nB\n\nB\n\n40\n30\n20\n\nBB\nB B\n\n10\n\nB\nB\nB\nBB\nBB\n\nB\nBB\n\nB B\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\nTime (UT hours) Night 212\n\n9\n\n5.4\n\n40\n30\n20\n\nB\n\n0\n4\n\n50\n\n5.6\n5.8\n6\nTime (UT hours) Night 271\n\n10\n0\n6.2\n\nFig. 9.- Outer scale length vs. time for the four nights with star tracker data from both siderostats.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n= 1.03L0 (PSD) (\u03b2 = 1.50)\n\n(15)\n\n= 1.18L0 (PSD) (\u03b2 = 1.35)\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\nSpectral Slope\n\nOur measured power law slopes for short time scale delay variations were largely in the range\n1.40\u20131.50, and were in all cases shallower than the three-dimensional Kolmogorov value of 5/3. The\nspectral slope was not correlated with the coherence time, at least when atmospheric conditions\nwere stable enough for operation of the interferometer.\nThe Kolmogorov spectrum is based on dimensional considerations (Tatarski 1961). Measurements of strong turbulence in a variety of fluids have shown good agreement to Kolmogorov spectra\n(Grant et al. 1962; Frish & Orszag 1990). However, atmospheric conditions during astronomical\nobservations involve much weaker turbulence. Intermittent turbulence (Frish et al. 1978) may\ndecrease the slope of the spectrum under these conditions.\nBuscher et al. (1995) analyzed atmospheric fluctuations with interferometric measurements\nfrom Mt. Wilson, on baselines from 3 to 31 m in length. Based on power spectral densities, they\nfound a mean slope slightly shallower than Kolmogorov, by 0.12 (equivalent to a slope of 1.55 for\ndelay structure functions). Bester et al. (1992) also used data from Mt. Wilson. However, all their\nshort time scale measurements were made with a laser distance interferometer, over a horizontal\npath of length \u223c 10 m, located 3 m above the ground. They measured spectral slopes shallower\nthan the Kolmogorov value by nearly 0.30 (i.e. a structure function exponent of \u03b2 \u2248 1.40).\nOur results agree with those of Bester et al. (1992), although our data were taken on approximately vertical line-of-sight paths through the entire atmosphere, and theirs on much shorter paths\nnear the ground. Our results disagree with those of Buscher et al. (1995), if we use the standard\ncorrespondence between the exponents of the power spectral density (\u03b3) and structure function\n(\u03b2): \u2212\u03b2 \u2212 1 \u2194 \u03b3 (Armstrong & Sramek 1982). However, Bester et al. (1992) report the surprising\nresult that their value of \u03b3 is often 0.1 or 0.2 steeper than \u2212\u03b2 \u2212 1 for the same data (their actual\ncomparison is between power spectral density and Allan variance, whose slope is nearly equal to\nthat of the structure function at short time scales). They speculate that the discrepancy may result\nfrom occasional bursts with \u03b2 > 2, for which the \u2212\u03b2 \u2212 1 \u2194 \u03b3 connection does not hold.\nFor D\u03c4 \u221d (\u2206t)\u03b2 , the dependence of coherence length r0 upon wavelength \u03bb will be\nr0 \u221d \u03bb2/\u03b2 , and the seeing (\u03b8) will vary as \u03b8 \u221d \u03bb1\u22122/\u03b2 . A value of \u03b2 = 5/3 gives \u03b8 \u221d \u03bb\u22120.2 , while\n\u03b2 = 1.40 gives \u03b8 \u221d \u03bb\u22120.43 . Numerous reports of exceptional seeing at infrared wavelengths (e.g.\ndiffraction rings in images with the Palomar 5 m telescope at wavelengths of 10 \u03bcm and even 5 \u03bcm)\nare most easily explained with a steep dependence of seeing vs. wavelength.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nFor astrometry with ground-based interferometry, a low value of \u03b2 has favorable consequences.\nOver a baseline of length B, the instantaneous delay uncertainty \u2206\u03c4atm of the atmosphere will be:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03bb B \u03b2/2\n\u2206\u03c4atm \u223c\n2\u03c0 r0\n\nHere r0 is the coherence length at wavelength \u03bb, and an infinite outer scale length is assumed. For\na finite outer scale length L0 , the baseline length B should be replaced with L0 .\n\n5.2.\n\nTurbulence speed and height\n\nOur derived wind velocity for the turbulent layer(s) (section 4.2) was low: 1\u20134 m s\u22121 (plus a\nsmall 10 m s\u22121 component on one night). For interferometric measurements on only one star at a\ntime, we have no direct constraint on the height of the turbulence. However, the very low velocities\nsuggest that the turbulence was at low altitudes, perhaps even within 100 m of the surface. Treuhaft\net al. (1995) derived a low altitude (< 45 m) for the majority of the turbulence seen at the Mt.\nWilson Infrared Spatial Interferometer, based on a correlation between fluctuations seen with the\nstarlight interferometer and a laser distance interferometer.\nSimultaneous observations of two (or more) stars with the same pair of siderostats would allow\na direct determination of turbulent height.\n\n5.3.\n\nOuter Scale Lengths\n\nOur measured outer scale lengths are mostly in the range 10\u201325 m, in agreement with results\nreported by others (Coulman et al. 1988; Ziad et al. 1994). All our values are less than half the 110 m\nlength of our baseline, giving us confidence that our results are not significantly corrupted by the\nfinite length of the baseline. Because these outer scale values are based on simultaneous measured\ndelay and angle time series on a long baseline, they are less sensitive to modeling assumptions than\nmost previously published results. Shao & Colavita (1992) derived the effect of a finite outer scale\nsize on the accuracy of narrow angle astrometry. For L0 << B (B is the baseline length), the\naccuracy improvement over an infinite outer scale, for \u03b2 = 5/3, is (L0 /B)1/3 . For L0 \u2248 15 m and\nB = 110 m, this factor is \u2248 0.5. For longer baselines, the accuracy improves as B \u22121 , rather than\nas B \u22122/3 for an infinite outer scale.\nThis work was performed at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute\nof Technology, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\ncontract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
