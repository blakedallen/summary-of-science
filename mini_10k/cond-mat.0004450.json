INTRODUCTION\n\nThe path integral method for indistinguishable particles developed in Refs. 1,2 seems\nan adequate tool for the investigation of both the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium\nproperties of interacting quantum many-body systems. The advantages of the path integral\nrepresentation are particularly manifest when investigating systems with a fixed (few or\nmany) number of particles. As demonstrated in Refs. 1,2, the thermodynamical properties\nof systems with a limited number of particles might deviate substantially from those obtained\nin the thermodynamical limit.\nElectrons confined to a quantum dot can provide a typical example of a system with\na fixed number of indistinguishable particles. In recent years, the quantum states and\nthe optical properties of these systems have received considerable attention. Multi-electron\nstates in 3D and 2D quantum dots (without the electron-phonon interaction) have, e. g.,\n1\n\n\fbeen treated in Refs. 3\u201311. It has been shown in Ref. 11 that the interaction between the\ncharge carriers strongly influences the optical spectra of few-particle quantum dots. The\nbipolaron ground state in quantum dots has been studied in Ref. 12. Cooperative effects for\na gas of polarons and bipolarons were treated in Ref. 13 on the basis of a model introduced\nby Friedberg and Lee14 . To the best of our knowledge, the effects of the electron-phonon\ninteraction on the optical spectra of multi-electron quantum dots with a fixed number of\nelectrons have hitherto not been investigated theoretically.\nExperimentally observed optical absorption spectra of high-Tc cuprates15\u201317 are very\npromising to reveal new manifestations of the interaction between electrons (holes) and the\nlongitudinal optical (LO) phonons. A possible role of polarons in high-Tc superconductivity\nhas been analyzed by several authors (see, e. g., Refs. 18\u201321). Some aspects of the recently\nobserved optical absorption spectra of high-Tc superconductors22\u201324 can be interpreted using the polaron theory25\u201327 . It has been shown in Ref. 28 that certain characteristics of\nthe polaron optical absorption at intermediate Fr\u00f6hlich coupling constant \u03b1 appear in the\naforementioned spectra15\u201317 . Bipolaron optical absorption in bulk materials has, e. g., been\ntreated in Refs. 29,30. In view of the relatively high concentration of electrons (holes) in\nhigh-Tc superconductors, the development of an all-coupling and all-concentration theory of\nthe optical response of many-polaron systems is an urgent problem.\nII. GROUND-STATE ENERGY\n\nIn the present communication, we treat the ground state energy and the optical absorption spectra of a multi-electron (multi-polaron) parabolic quantum dot for arbitrary\nelectron-phonon coupling strength, using a recently developed path integral formalism for\nthe quantum statistical treatment of identical particles1,2 and considering the expected quite\nlarge polaron coupling constant in those materials. We consider a system consisting of N\nelectrons in a parabolic confinement potential characterized by the frequency parameter \u03a90 .\nThese electrons are assumed to interact with each other and with the LO phonons. The\nP\nelectron subsystem is subdivided into two groups (N = \u03c3 N\u03c3 , where N\u03c3 is the number of\nelectrons with definite spin projection \u03c3 = \u00b11/2).\nIn the present work the ground state energy of N polarons confined to a quantum dot has\nbeen determined for the first time. This calculation has been performed within the extended\nJensen-Feynman variational principle 1 taking into account the symmetry properties of the\nelectrons with respect to permutations. The validity of this extension of the Jensen-Feynman\ninequality for systems of indistinguishable particles, which is not obvious, and which is of\ncrucial importance for the present work, has been demonstrated in Ref. 1. We have used\nan auxiliary model system of particles in a harmonic confinement potential with elastic\ninterparticle interactions as studied in Refs. 1,2. The parameters of the auxiliary model\nsystem have been treated as variational parameters. We have worked out the variational\nprocedure to obtain those variational parameters at arbitrary temperature for the physical\nsystem of N polarons confined to a parabolic potential. The calculation has been performed\nfor the case of closed shells (i. e. of a non-degenerate ground state) and for the case of open\nshells.\nWe have calculated the ground state energy of a parabolically confined many-polaron\nsystem as a function of the total spin of the system S = 21 N+1/2 \u2212 N\u22121/2 . For relatively\n2\n\n\fsmall polaron coupling constant and all values of \u03b7 \u2261 \u03b5\u221e /\u03b50 (\u03b5\u221e and \u03b50 are the highfrequency and the static dielectric constants, respectively), except \u03b7 \u226a 1, the electrons tend\nto maximally fill up open shells with the same spin projection (cf. the first Hund's rule). In\nthis domain of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b7, the ground state is obtained when at least one of\nthe numbers N\u00b11/2 equals the number of states Mn in a set of shells labelled by the index k\nfrom 0 to n (see Ref. 2):\nMn =\n\nn\nX\n\ngk =\n\nk=0\n\n(n + 1) (n + 2) (n + 3)\n(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .),\n6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere gk \u2261 21 (k + 1) (k + 2) is the degeneracy of the kth energy level of a three-dimensional\noscillator. For n = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . the values of the number Mn are 1, 4, 10, 20 . . ..\nThis filling scheme is broken for strongly polar substances (\u03b7 \u226a 1), where we find that\nthe lowest variational energy corresponds to the minimal possible total spin (S = 0 for N\neven, and S = 21 for N odd), or for \u03b1 \u226b 1 (except the region \u03b7 \u226a 1), where the lowest\nvariational energy corresponds to the maximal possible total spin (S = N/2).\nIn Table 1, the variational ground state energy per particle E0 /N is shown for N = 20\npolarons in a quantum dot with confinement frequency parameter \u03a90 = 0.5 at \u03b1 = 5, for\ndifferent values of \u03b7.\nTable 1. The variational ground state energy per particle E0 /N (in units of the LO\nphonon energy h\u0304\u03c9LO ) for different \u03b7 for N = 20 polarons in a quantum dot with the\nconfinement frequency parameter \u03a90 = 0.5 (in units of \u03c9LO ) at \u03b1 = 5.\n\u03b7\n0.01\n0.081\n0.082\n0.4\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nN+ 1 = 20,\nN 1 = 10,\n2\n\uf8f8 E0 /N \uf8ed + 2\n\uf8f8\nE0 /N \uf8ed\nN\u2212 1 = 0\nN\u2212 1 = 10\n2\n\n\u22123. 9404\n\u22122.0867\n\u22122.0626\n5.8487\n\n2\n\n\u22124.1078\n\u22122.0873\n\u22122.0620\n6.0482\n\nAs follows from this table, a ferromagnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition takes place at a value\nof \u03b7 in the interval between 0.081 and 0.082. It will be analyzed below how this transition\ninfluences the optical absorption spectra.\nIII. OPTICAL ABSORPTION SPECTRA\n\nIn order to investigate the optical properties of the confined many-polaron system, we use\nthe formalism developed in Refs. 25\u201327. An alternative derivation can be found in Ref. 30.\nWithin this technique, the absorption spectrum for a many-polaron system in a parabolic\nconfinement potential is given by the expression\n\u0393 (\u03c9) \u223c\n\n[\u03c9 \u2212\n\n\u03a920 /\u03c9\n\n\u2212Im\u03c7 (\u03c9)\n,\n2\n\u2212 Re\u03c7 (\u03c9)] + [Im\u03c7 (\u03c9)]2\n\nwhere the memory function is\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u03c7 (\u03c9) =\n\nX\nq\n\n\u221e\ni\n\u0011\nh\n2 |Vq |2 q 2 Z \u0010 i\u03c9t\ne \u2212 1 Im T\u03c9\u2217LO (t) h\u03c1q (t) \u03c1\u2212q (0)iSM dt.\n3Nh\u0304\u03c9\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nThe function T\u03c9 (t) = cos [\u03c9 (t \u2212 i\u03b2/2)] / sinh (\u03b2\u03c9/2) with \u03b2 = h\u0304/kB T describes the phonon\ndynamics. The time-dependent correlation function h\u03c1q (t) \u03c1\u2212q (0)iSM is the path integral\naverage for an auxiliary model action functional SM of N identical electrons and NB identical\nfictitious particles (simulating the influence of the LO phonon bath). As emphasized above,\nthe parameters of the auxiliary model system are determined using the variational procedure\nfor the physical system of N confined polarons under consideration. Note that, formally, the\nterm \u03a920 /\u03c9 plays a role similar to the cyclotron frequency \u03c9c in the theory of the cyclotron\nresonance of polarons31 . In the zero temperature limit, we have obtained the following\nanalytic expression for the memory function:\n2\u03b1m\u2217\n\u03c7 (\u03c9) =\n3\u03c0N\u03c9\n\u00d7\n\n(\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e X\nX\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9LO\nA\n\n(\u22121)p3\np1 =0 p2 =0 p3 =0 p1 !p2 !p3 !\n\n\u00133/2 X\n\u221e X\n\u221e X\n\u221e\n\nNm,\u03c3 (1 \u2212 Nn,\u03c3 )\n\nm=0 n=0 \u03c3\n\n\"\n\na21\nN\u03a91 A\n\n!p 1\n\na22\nN\u03a92 A\n\n!p2 \u0012\n\n1\nNwA\n\n\u0013 p3\n\n1\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9LO \u2212 [p1 \u03a91 + p2 \u03a92 + (p3 \u2212 m + n) w] + i\u03b5\n\nP\n1\n+2\n\u2212\n\u03c9 + \u03c9LO + p1 \u03a91 + p2 \u03a92 + (p3 \u2212 m + n) w + i\u03b5\n\u03c9LO + p1 \u03a91 + p2 \u03a92 + (p3 \u2212 m + n) w\n\u00d7\n\nm\nX\n\nn\nX\n\nl=0 k=n\u2212m+l\n\u0013l+k\n\n1\n\u00d7\nwA\n\n\u0010\n\n(\u22121)n\u2212m+l+k \u0393 p1 + p2 + p3 + k + l +\n!\n\n(k)!

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\n\nIn Fig. 1, the optical absorption spectra of a many-polaron system in a quantum dot\nwith parabolic confinement potential are plotted for \u03a90 = 0.5 (all frequencies are measured\nin units of \u03c9LO ), \u03b1 = 1 and for N = 5, 10, 14 (panels a, b, c, respectively). Due to the\nconfinement in all three dimensions, the electron motion is fully quantized. Hence, when\n4\n\n\fa photon is absorbed, the electron recoil can be transferred only by discrete quanta. As\na result, the absorption spectrum consists of a series of \u03b4-like peaks as distinct from the\nabsorption spectrum of a bulk polaron. In this and subsequent figures, the height of each\npeak represents its intensity.\nFig. 2 shows, for reference, the optical absorption spectrum for a single polaron confined\nto a quantum dot with \u03a90 = 0.2 for \u03b1 = 5, and reveals several essential elements. Following\nthe nomenclature of Refs. 25,26 we distinguish a central (zero-phonon) peak, peaks due\nto transitions to the relaxed excited state (RES), and peaks associated with transitions to\nthe Franck-Condon state (FC). Also it is worth mentioning that there is the \"one-phonon\nshoulder\" in the optical absorption spectrum with threshold at \u03c9 \u223c 1. The envelope of\nthe absorption spectrum for a polaron in a quantum dot is very similar to the bulk polaron\nabsorption spectra for the same \u03b1, as first obtained in Ref. 25. It follows that the obtained\noptical absorption spectra for a polaron confined to a quantum dot are consistent with those\nfor a bulk polaron25,26 .\nAs follows from Figs. 1 and 2, the \u03b4-like \"central peak\" for a system of polarons, confined\nto a quantum dot with parabolic confinement potential, is positioned at \u03c9 \u223c \u03a90 . Without\nthe electron-phonon interaction, the \"central peak\" for a system of electrons, confined to a\nquantum dot with parabolic confinement, is exactly at the confinement parameter: \u03c9 = \u03a90 .\nFig. 3 shows the evolution of the absorption spectrum as a function of the confinement\nparameter \u03a90 , for \u03a90 = 0.5, \u03a90 = 0.8, \u03a90 = 1 and \u03a90 = 1.2. This calculation is performed for N = 4, \u03b1 = 3, \u03b7 = 0.3. Near \u03a90 = 1, the zero-phonon and the one-phonon\npeaks are of comparable oscillator strength. A formal analogy (particularly manifest for\nsufficiently small \u03b1) exists between the resonance condition \u03a90 = 1 discussed here and the\nwee-established magnetophonon resonance around \u03c9c = 1 (Refs. 32,33). We suggest the\ndesignation \"confinement-phonon resonance\".\nFig. 4 illustrates the ferromagnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition induced by the increase of\nthe electron-phonon interaction for a many-polaron system confined to a quantum dot. In\nthis figure, optical absorption spectra are plotted for N = 20 polarons in a quantum dot\nwith confinement parameter \u03a90 = 0.5, and with electron-phonon coupling constant \u03b1 = 5.\nThe parameter \u03b7 varies from \u03b7 = 0.01 to \u03b7 = 0.4, and we find that, as a consequence, the\ntotal spin of the ground state jumps from S = 0 to S = 10. As seen from Table 1, for\n\u03b7 \u2264 0.081, the ground state with S = 0 is energetically favorable. The optical absorption\nspectra for this case are shown on panels a (\u03b7 = 0.01) and b (\u03b7 = 0.081) of Fig. 4. A\nseries of pronounced peaks clearly related to the internal polaron excitations (cf. RES of a\nsingle polaron in Fig. 2) is seen in the spectrum for the case of a strongly polar substance\n(\u03b7 = 0.01). With increasing \u03b7, the relative intensity of these \"RES\" (many-polaron) peaks\nwith respect to that of the zero-phonon peak decreases as is seen from Fig. 4. This effect is\ndue to weakening of the electron-phonon interaction with increasing parameter \u03b7.\nIn the specific case under consideration (N = 20), when \u03b7 varies from \u03b7 = 0.081 to\n\u03b7 = 0.082, the total spin abruptly changes from S = 0 [N1/2 = 10, N\u22121/2 = 10] to its\nmaximal value S = 10 [N1/2 = 20 (0), N\u22121/2 = 0 (20)], i. e., the electrons become fully spinpolarized. Such a jump in the magnitude of the total spin can also be realized by varying\nthe confinement parameter at fixed \u03b1 and \u03b7. Comparing the optical absorption spectra in\npanels b and c of Fig. 4, one observes that the optical absorption spectrum as a whole shows\nan abrupt change at the ferromagnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition, though the shift of the\n5\n\n\fmost intense phonon sidebands towards lower frequencies (with increasing \u03b7) continuously\nproceeds when \u03b7 passes through the value 0.081. Note also the shift to lower frequencies of\nthe most intense phonon sidebands (again related to the \"many-polaron RES\") in Fig. 4b\ncompared to Fig. 4a.\nV. MOMENTS OF THE OPTICAL ABSORPTION SPECTRA\n\nWe have calculated (both for closed-shell and open-shell systems) the first frequency moment M1 of the optical absorption spectrum for a N-polaron system confined to a quantum\ndot with parabolic confinement potential\n\u221e\n\u03bc1\n0 \u03c9\u0393 (\u03c9) d\u03c9\nh\u03c9i \u2261\n= R\u221e\n\u03bc0\n0 \u0393 (\u03c9) d\u03c9\n\nR\n\nwith \u0393 (\u03c9) the optical absorption coefficient, and the parameter \u03c3 \u2261\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212 h\u03c9i)2 = \u03c9 2 \u2212 h\u03c9i2\n\n(5)\nrD\n\nE\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212 h\u03c9i)2 , where\n(6)\n\nis the normalized second frequency moment of the optical absorption spectrum.\nThe results for the first frequency moment of the optical ansorption spectrua for N polarons in a quantum dot with parabolic confinement are shown in Fig. 5a. The first frequency\nmoment is plotted as a function of the effective density N/V, where V = (4\u03c0/3) (h\u0304/2m\u03a90 )3/2 .\nThe points corresponding to definite N are shown by filled circles. The number of particles\nranges from N = 1 to N = 20. The points indicated by arrows are related to the closed-shell\nsystems.\nThe function h\u03c9i (N/V) turns out to be non-monotonous. There is a maximum of the\nfirst frequency moment h\u03c9i at N = 2. The first frequency moment has a minimum when\nthe number of particles takes the value N = 14 corresponding to the closed-shell system\n(N+1/2 = 10, N\u22121/2 = 4).\nBy its general trend, the first frequency moment of the optical absorption spectrum as a\nfunction of the effective density strikingly resembles the first moment of optical conductivity\nspectrum in Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4\u2212y recently observed experimentally (Fig. 5b and Ref. 34). Note\nthat our theory describes a 3D confined system, while the experiment relates to a quasi-2D\ntranslationally invariant system. Therefore, the theory can be expected to reveal only a\nqualitative trend of the first frequency moment as a function of concentration in comparison\nwith experiment.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented the ground state energy and the optical absorption spectra calculated for a system of N polarons in a parabolic confinement potential for any strength of\nthe polaron coupling. Path integral formalism for the quantum statistical physics of indistinguishable particles1,2 has allowed to develop the variational procedure1 for the ground\nstate energy for a finite number of polarons. For the first time, the ground state energy and\n6\n\n\fthe optical absorption spectra have been analyzed for N electrons (holes) interacting with\neach other and with the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons at an arbitrary electron-phonon\ncoupling strength \u03b1 to a parabolic confinement potential. A new type of transition for\nN polarons confined in a parabolic potential (ferromagnetic-to-nonmagnetic transition) is\nfound between states with different total spin, which is related to the competition between\nthe Coulomb repulsion and the phonon-mediated attraction between the electrons. For relatively weak polaron coupling constant, the electrons are shown to maximally fill up shells\nwith the same spin projection (cf. the first Hund's rule). This filling scheme is demonstrated\nto be broken for strongly polar substances (\u03b7 \u226a 1), where we find that the lowest variational energy corresponds to the minimal possible total spin. The present analysis has been\nexecuted for closed-shell and open-shell systems.\nThe optical absorption spectra have been calculated here using the memory function\napproach as applied to path integrals for a many-polaron system confined to a quantum dot\nwith different number of polarons. The dependence of the optical absorption spectra on the\nconfinement parameter \u03a90 reveals a resonant behavior for \u03a90 \u2248 1, especially if \u03b1 is small.\nThe polaron RES25,26 are seen to also influence the optical absorption spectra of N confined\npolarons.\nWe have analysed also the first frequency moment of the optical absorption spectrum for\na N-polaron system in a parabolic quantum dot for both closed-shell and open-shell systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work has been supported by the BOF NOI (UA-UIA), GOA BOF UA 2000, IUAP,\nFWO-V. projects G.0287.95, 9.0193.97, and the W.O.G.

The LO phonon frequencies \u03c9LO for x = 0.15, y = 0 at\n295 K are 596, 506, 490 cm-1 [35]. According to the value of the plasma frequency from [35],\nthe concentration corresponding to n* = n0 is estimated to be ~ 1019 cm-3. By courtesy of\nP. Calvani.\nAs discussed in the text, comparison between theory and experiment reveals only qualitative\ntrends of <\u03c9> as a function of concentration.\n\n\f"}
