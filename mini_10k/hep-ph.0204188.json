Different techniques were used to analyze this\nsample in search for density excesses from astrophysical point-like\nsources. No evidence for DC excesses for any source in an all-sky\nsurvey is reported. In addition, searches for muon excess correlated\nwith the known binary periods of Cygnus X-3 and Hercules X-1,\nand searches for statistically significant bursting episodes from known\ngamma ray sources are also proved negative.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe interest in the search for cosmic ray point sources identified from a\nmeasurable flux of underground muons has historical motivations mainly\nbecause of the \"CygX-3 saga\". Cygnus X-3 (CygX-3) is a galactic binary\nsystem well studied in all types of electromagnetic radiation, most notably\nin the X-rays. At \u03b3-ray energies, E \u2265 1015 eV, the Kiel Extensive Air\nShower array (EAS) initially reported an excess of events from CygX-3\ncorrelated with its 4.8 hour binary period[1]. This observation appeared to\nconfirm previous results at lower energies [2, 3]. Subsequently, several groups\noperating EAS array experiments and atmospheric \u010cerenkov telescopes\nconfirmed the signals with different statistical significance and at different\nenergy thresholds [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These results prompted a new generation\nof more sensitive experiments using new techniques. The new experiments\nreported clear evidence of TeV \u03b3-ray emissions from many galactic (i.e., Crab\nand SN1006 [10, 11, 12]) and the extragalactic AGN-like (i.e., Mrk421 and\nMrk501 [13, 14]) sources. Finally, in 1990-1991 the new generation detectors\nCASA-MIA[15] and CYGNUS[16] put stringent upper limits to the \u03b3-ray\nsignal from CygX-3, which excluded early observations.\nSoon after the initial EAS detection from CygX-3, two underground\nexperiments (Soudan 1 [17] and NUSEX [18]) reported excesses in TeV muons\npointing back to the CygX-3 direction when correlating event arrival time\nwith the known orbital period of the source. These detections suggested new\nphysics beyond the Standard Model since muons are the products of the decay\nof charged pions and kaons, which are produced by primary Cosmic Ray (CR)\ninteractions with atmospheric nuclei. Charged CR nuclei cannot propagate\n\n\fdirectly from CygX-3 across 10 kpc to the Earth and there is only a very\nlow probability of UHE \u03b3-rays producing TeV muons underground[19, 20].\nInvestigations by other underground detectors [21, 22, 23, 24], however failed\nto detect any significant muon excess from that source or any other.\nThe MACRO experiment, which ended its operations life in December\n2000, was a large area underground detector able to reconstruct muon arrival\ndirections to very high accuracy [25]. The apparatus started operations in\n1989 and was completed in April 1994. A preliminary investigation using a\nlimited data sample of \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 106 muons collected by its first and second\nsupermodules was published in 1993 [26]. Since then, MACRO has increased\nthe muon sample by a factor of 30, its pointing capability has been accurately\ndetermined and its direction reconstruction capability carefully studied.\nIn this paper we present the final results on the search for a muon excess\nwith respect to the evaluated background by surveying the sky in declination\nfrom -15\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 and from several candidate UHE gamma ray emitters.\nWe also present a more sensitive search for CygX-3 and HerX-1 using their\nknown periodicities. Finally we searched for bursting behavior of Mrk421\nand Mrk501.\n\n2\n\nThe MACRO detector\n\nMACRO was a multipurpose underground detector located in the Gran Sasso\nunderground Laboratory (LNGS-INFN). It was designed to search for rare\nevents in the cosmic radiation and its sensitivity was optimized to detect\nsupermassive magnetic monopoles. The detector [27, 28] had a modular\nstructure and dimensions of 76.5 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 9.3 m3 with a total acceptance for an\nisotropic flux of about 104 m2 sr. The rock overburden had a minimal depth\nof 3150 m.w.e and an average of 3700 m.w.e.\nThe minimal energy of surface muons that trigger the MACRO apparatus\nwas about 1.3 TeV. The rock coverage was very irregular and the actual\nslant depth under which a source is observable was taken into account when\nevaluating the muon flux at the surface. The full detector acceptance for\ndowngoing muons with zenith angles \u2264 72\u25e6 was about 3100 m2 sr.\nThe detector has worked with different configurations starting with\n1 supermodule at the beginning and finally with the full configuration\nconsisting of 6 supermodules and the upper half called the \"Attico\"[28]. The\nactive detection elements are planes of streamer tubes for tracking and liquid\n\n\fscintillation counters for fast timing. The lower half of the detector is filled\nwith streamer tube planes alternating with trays of crushed rock. The upper\npart is hollow and contains the electronics racks and work areas. There are\n10 horizontal streamer tube planes in the bottom half of the detector, and 4\nplanes on the top, all with wires and 27\u25e6 strips, providing stereo readout of\nthe detector hits. Six vertical planes of streamer tubes cover each side of the\ndetector.\n\n3\n\nData selection\n\nThe data used in this analysis were collected in the period May 1989December 2000. The total number of recorded muons is approximately 60\nmillion.\nIn order to optimize the quality of the tracking reconstruction and to\neliminate periods when the detector was malfunctioning, we applied several\ncuts on a run-by-run basis. These run cuts include a check on the efficiency of\nthe streamer tubes system whose data were used for the track reconstruction,\nand a check on the event rate. The streamer tube efficiency was obtained\nusing the sub-sample of tracks crossing all the 10 lower streamer tube planes;\nruns having an average efficiency smaller than 90% for the wire view and 85%\nfor the strip view were discarded. As the detector configuration changed\nduring the data taking, the average value of the counting rate was computed\nfor each run. Those with abnormal rates, i.e., runs having muon counting\nrate that deviated by more than \u00b13\u03c3 from the average, were cut.\nIn addition to the described run cuts, we applied event cuts by excluding:\n\u2022 events having zenith angles larger than 72\u25e6 ; the cut is due to the large\nuncertainties in the rock depth crossed by these events;\n\u2022 events whose reconstruction in one of the two streamer tube stereo\nviews is missing;\n\u2022 muons in a bundle with multiplicity larger than 2; this cut is necessary\nbecause the reconstructed direction in space for high multiplicity events\nis not completely reliable;\n\u2022 events that had no arrival time given by the Universal Time Clock\n(UTC);\n\n\f\u2022 events that do not cross at least 3 planes of the lower part of the\napparatus; this cut excludes low energy muons [29] coming from\npossible secondary interactions and it improves the angular resolution.\nThe minimal muon energy to satisfy this cut is 1 GeV.\nThese cuts reduce the sample to 49.9 million well-reconstructed single and\ndouble muon events during 74,073 hours of livetime. Table 1 shows, for\ndifferent data taking periods, the detector configuration, the number of events\nwhich survived the cuts and the effective livetime.\n\n4\n\nBackground estimation\n\nSeveral methods were suggested to evaluate the background when looking\nfor an excess of counts from a fixed direction in the sky [16, 30, 31]. Many\nexperiments simply consider, as an estimation of the background, the average\nvalue of the counts of the surrounding sky bins with respect to a selected one\n[32]. An alternative way is to average the counts of all the bins at the\nsame declination \u03b4, except the chosen one in a particular value of the right\nascension (RA). The assumption that cosmic rays arrive uniformly from any\ndirection in the sky is implicit in this method. For an underground detector\nboth methods require that the unequal distribution of the overburden and\nthe dead-time of the apparatus be taken carefully into account [21].\nIn our analysis, we adopted a different approach. Assuming that the\narrival directions and the arrival time of underground muons are uncorrelated\nvariables, we constructed sets of simulated events by randomly coupling the\ntimes and the directions of each event in local coordinates. A mandatory\nrequirement for this method is a good accuracy in the measurement of the\narrival direction and of the recorded time. For this reason, we excluded from\nthe analysis all the runs and the events with errors in the readout time, as\ndescribed in the previous section. We determined that the optimum number\nof background events to be associated with each real event, minimizing the\ncomputer processing time, is 25. A total number of 1.3\u00d7108 simulated muons\nwere generated as background. Figure 1 presents the distribution of observed\nevents vs. the right ascension RA (a) and the sine of the declination sin\u03b4 (b)\ntogether with the simulated background. The fluctuations in the simulated\ndistributions are small compared with those in the data. The unevenness in\nRA is due to the effect of the dead times. The sin\u03b4 distribution reflects the\nshape of the mountain and also the exposure of MACRO (see [26]).\n\n\f5\n\nBest sky bin definition\n\nIt is usual for astronomical telescopes to define a point spread function (PSF)\nthat in most cases is a simple bi-dimensional normal distribution. The PSF\ncan be used to define the optimal source bin, i.e., the half-angle \u03b8 of a cone\ncentered on a source giving the maximum signal over background ratio \u221aSB .\nFor a normal PSF distribution with variance \u03c3 it is shown in [16] that the\nbest value of the half-angle of a cone is \u03b8 = 1.58\u03c3. This cone contains, on\naverage, 72% of the total number of events.\nThe MACRO PSF was defined using the double muon sample. A\ndouble muon event (as in general multiple muon events) is produced by an\ninteraction of a primary nucleus at the top of the atmosphere; muons are\nexpected to arrive at the earth surface practically parallel. When reaching\nan underground detector, the reconstructed spatial directions of these two\nmuons differ as a consequence of the independent scattering of each muon.\nWe can therefore estimate the MACRO PSF by using as a variable the\ndistribution of the angular separation of the reconstructed muon\n\u221a directions\n\u03b8 for double muon events. This value must be divided by a 2 factor to\naccount for the two independent scatterings [26].\nWe found [26, 27, 28] that 50% of double muons events are contained\nin a cone of 0.5\u25e6 half-angle, and that 72% of events are contained in a\ncone of 1.05\u25e6 half-angle. Initially, this result suggests that the best value\nfor the MACRO search bin (assuming\nthat the \u03b8 is normally distributed)\n\u221a\n\u25e6\nis an half-angle cone of 1.05 / 2. To produce the bidimensional (RA, \u03b4)\ndistribution representing our PSF (shown in Fig. 2) we used the differences\nbetween\nthe reconstructed muon directions in RA and declination \u03b4, divided\n\u221a\nby 2. The main contribution to the differences between the reconstructed\ndirections is the multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) of muons in the rock.\nThe PSF shown in Fig. 2 has a non-gaussian shape, with more events for\nsmall displacements and longer tails. The latter were produced by stochastic\ninteraction process in the muon energy loss.\nTo obtain the value of the best search cone angle, we performed a\ndedicated Monte Carlo. A source was simulated in a particular (RA, \u03b4)\ncell, and the events were extracted according to the PSF of Fig. 2. The\nbackground events were generated according to a flat density distribution.\nWe calculated the ratio \u221aSB as a function of the search cone angle, as shown\nin Fig. 3. The maximum of the \u221aSB ratio is reached for a search cone angle\n\n\fof \u223c 0.4-0.5\u25e6, which thus will represent the best choice value for MACRO.\nAs an independent check of the validity of the simulation, we studied\nthe signal due to the Moon shadowing effect (in this case, a lack of events)\nmeasured by our detector [25]. The cumulative number of missing events\nobscured by the Moon's disk, as function of the angular distance from the\nMoon center, shows maximum evidence for a deficit using a cone of 0.45\u25e6 halfangle.\nFrom all these indications the best value for the search cone angle was\nchosen to 0.5\u25e6 . However, in the analyses with very low bin contents such\nas those used in the search for flaring activities, we use an enlarged search\nwindow due to poor statistics.\n\n6\n\nSearch for DC sources\n\nIn the search for a steady excess of muons from any direction of the sky (DC\npoint-like sources search) we performed an all-sky survey without a priori\nassumptions. We divided the sky into 37176 bins of equal solid angle (\u2206\u03a9=\n2.3\u00d7 10\u22124 sr; \u2206RA = 1\u25e6 , \u2206sin\u03b4 = 0.013). These bins have the same \u2206\u03a9\nas a narrow cone of half-angle 0.5\u25e6 . We examined the sky bins looking for\nsignificant deviations from the simulated background. The deviation was\n\u2212nexp )\n\u221a\ndefined as \u03c3 = (nobs\n, where nobs is the number of events observed in\nnexp\neach bin and nexp is the expected number of background events in that bin.\nWe used three different sky grids, each displaced by half bin width in\nRA, in sin(\u03b4) and in both coordinates, to take into account the possibility\nthat a source can be located at the edge of one of the bins. Fig. 4 shows\nthe distributions of the deviations for the four sky-maps with the best-fit\nGaussian function superposed. The positive deviations in the first map are\nreported in the bidimensional map in RA and sin\u03b4 of Fig. 5. No particular\npattern or clustering of positive deviations is observed. The line indicating\nthe galactic plane is also shown. We conclude that there is no evidence for a\nsteady source emitting muons in our data.\nWe calculated the 95% C.L muon flux for all sky bins using the formula\n[26]:\nn\u03bc (95%)\nJstdy\ncm\u22122 s\u22121\n(1)\n\u03bc (95%) \u2264\nKAef f Texp\nwhere:\n\n\f- n\u03bc (95%) is the upper limit for the number of muons in the bin at\n95%C.L., where nobs and nexp are respectively the number of observed\nand expected events in that bin. n\u03bc (95%) was calculated, according to\n[33], as the value for which:\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nn\u03bc (95%)\n\n2 /2\u03c3 2\n\ne\u2212(n\u03bc \u2212n\u03bc )\n\u221a\n2\u03c3\n\ndn\u03bc = 0.05\n\n(2)\n\nwith n\u03bc =nobs \u2212 nexp and \u03c3 2 =nexp .\n- Aef f (i) is the average effective detector area for every bin. It was\ncomputed by averaging the projected area seen by each muon and\ntaking into account the geometrical and the tracking reconstruction\nefficiencies:\nAef f (i) =\n\n1\nnobs (i)\n\nnobs (i)\n\nX\n\nA(RAi , \u03b4i )\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere RAi and \u03b4i are the muon arrival right ascension and declination.\n- Texp is the exposure time computed as the time in which each bin is\nvisible. A bin is not visible in our apparatus, if its zenith angle is larger\nthan 72\u25e6 .\n- K is a correction factor which takes into account the fraction of muons\nwithin the bin dimensions for an hypothetical source placed at the bin\ncenter. We calculated K=0.5 for a search cone of 0.5\u25e6 half-angle and\nK=0.72 for 1.0\u25e6 half-angle.\nThe distribution of the 95% C.L. upper limit J\u03bcstdy (95%) for all the\n37176 bins in the sky region accessible for MACRO has an average value\nof 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . For almost all bins, the upper limit ranges between\n1 \u00d7 10\u221213 \u2264 J\u03bcstdy (95%) \u2264 4 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nFinally we also investigated some selected interesting point sources (in\nTable 2) identified by surface telescopes and EAS arrays [34, 35, 36, 37].\nNone of the selected sources in the list exhibits a significant deviation from\nthe background.\n\n\f7\n\nSearches for modulated signals from CygX3 and HerX-1\n\nPeriodic UHE gamma ray sources are attractive from the observational point\nof view. When it is known that the emission from the source is modulated\n\u221a\nwith a certain periodicity, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by N [38]\nby folding the event arrival time modulo the source period into N bins. This\nfolding procedure was employed to analyze the data from the direction of\nCygX-3 and HerX-1 [9, 39, 40].\nWe used the quadratic ephemeris reported in Table 3 and obtained from\nthe fit to the observed X-ray light curve [41], [42]. The phase diagrams for\nevents coming from a cone of 1\u25e6 , centered on the position of the two sources,\nare shown in Fig. 6. The expected number of background muons in each\nphase bin is also shown with the dashed lines.\nThe largest positive deviation (1.8 \u03c3) in the CygX-3 cycle is in the phase\nbin 0.1-0.2. The largest positive deviation for HerX-1 (1.7 \u03c3) is in the\nphase bin 0.7-0.8. Using the values of the largest fluctuation we computed\nthe 95% C.L. upper limits to the modulated muon flux using equation 1,\nand the results are reported in Table 3. In Fig. 7 our computed upper\nlimit for the modulated emission from CygX-3 is compared with those of\nprevious underground experiments. Our level is the lowest reached by such\ndetectors. The problem of understanding past positive observations still\nremain unsolved.\n\n8\n\nSearch for flaring activity from Mkn421\nand Mkn501\n\nDuring the 1995-1999, several \u010cerenkov telescopes reported observations of\nflaring activities up to 10-20 TeV from the two celestial objects Mkn421\nand Mkn501[44, 45, 46, 47]. These observations prompted us to search for\nbursting muon signals in a 1\u25e6 half-cone, around the position of these sources\nof U.H.E. photons. We used two different methods.\nIn the first method we studied, similarly to [48], the accumulation rate of\nevents coming from each of the two sources, adding day-by-day the differences\nbetween the measured number of events and the calculated background.\nFigures 8 and 9 show the cumulative excesses as a function of date (Julian\n\n\fdays) since MACRO starting data taking. The cumulative excess presents\nfluctuations, but never becomes significant.\nIn the second method we assumed (as in [49]) that the background has\na Poissonian distribution. If nexp is the expected daily background from the\ndirection of a source, then the probability to observe a random fluctuation\nof the background large as the observed nobs events in a day, is given by:\nP =1\u2212\n\nnobs\nX\u22121\nn=0\n\n\u03b1n\n(1 + \u03b1)\n\nn+nexp +1\n\n(n + nexp )!\nn! \u00d7 nexp !\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the ratio of the ON-source time to the OFF-source time. Because\nwe extract 25 simulated background events for each real one, \u03b1 is 0.04.\nFor a Poissonian background, the cumulative frequency distribution of P\nis expected to be a power law with index -1, in logarithmic scale.\nFigures 10 and 11 show the value of -log P evaluated day-by-day for\nMkn421 and Mkn501, respectively. In Fig. 10 the date of the largest\nfluctuations for Mkn421 with respect to the background are also indicated.\nTo verify the probability of such a positive fluctuation from Mkn421, we\ncomputed the quantity -log P for a set of selected bins having an exposure\nsimilar to the two Mkn objects, each monitored for about 3600 days.\nFigure 12 shows the log-log plot of the cumulative frequency distribution\nfor all these sky bins. Since this cumulative distribution has a slope close to\n-1, as expected in the case of no source detected, we can use the Poissonian\nstatistics to compute the expectation to see large fluctuations.\nWe set as an attention level a probability of \u2264 10\u22123 for a fluctuation.\nWe found 4 days with probability larger than 10\u22123 for Mkn421, and none\nfor Mkn501. We observed the Mkn421 source for 3600 days: assuming as\nattention level for any source the probability value of 10\u22123 , the expected\nnumber of random fluctuations with probability lower than 10\u22123 is 3600 *\n(1 \u00d7 10\u22123 ) = 3.6. Therefore the Poissonian probability to observe 4 random\nfluctuation in the same period, with an average of 3.6, is about 20%. This\nprobability value therefore excluded a positive observation of a burst from\nthis source.\n\n9\n\nConclusions\n\nSince February 1989, the MACRO detector collected 49.9 million wellconstructed muons. Using this sample, we searched for muon excesses above\n\n\fbackground from all visible sky directions and from known astrophysical\nsources. No significant excesses were found from the all-sky survey. We\ncomputed the 95% confidence level upper limit J\u03bcstdy (95%) for a steady muon\nflux for all the 37176 sky cells; the average value of J\u03bcstdy (95%) is equal to\n2.3\u00d710\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . We analyzed the muons coming from the direction of\nCyg X-3 and Her X-1, searching for a modulated emission, with a negative\nresult. The search for a steady or episodic emission coming from Mkn421 and\nMkn501 was made with two different methods. We found no muon excess\nabove the estimated background.\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the director and of the staff of\nthe Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso and the invaluable assistance of the\ntechnical staff of the Institutions participating in the experiment.
