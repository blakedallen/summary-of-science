In the \u03c3(\u03c9) of Bi2 Sr2 CuO6 measured down to 10 cm\u22121 , we have resolved, instead,\ntwo components separated by a deep minimum: i) a normal Drude term with \u0393=35 cm\u22121 at 30\nK, in very good agreement with transport data; ii) a strong band peaked in the far infrared (FIR),\nlikely due to bound charges, whose tail exhibits the \u03c9 \u22121 dependence. As the FIR peak softens for\nT \u2192 0, it opens a pseudogap-like depression in \u03c3(\u03c9) accordingly to ordinary sum rules.\nPACS numbers: 74.25.Gz, 74.72.-h, 74.25.Kc\n\nSeveral studies have been published during recent years\non the possible implications for high-Tc superconductivity of the \"pseudogap\". This term indicates a depression in the low-energy continuum of states of many highTc superconductors (HCTS), that has been observed by\ndifferent techniques below a characteristic temperature\nT \u2217 >> Tc . [1] The pseudogap has been observed also\nin the optical spectra of a number of metallic cuprates.\nThese include underdoped systems like Bi2 Sr2 CuO6 with\nTc = 8 K [2] and HgBa2 Ca2 Cu3 O8+y with Tc = 121 K,\n[3] overdoped cuprates like La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 with x > 0.18\n[4] and Tl2 Ba2 CuO6+y , [5] and even metals close to optimum doping like HgBa2 Ca2 Cu3 O8+y with Tc = 130 K [3]\nand Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+y with Tc = 90 K. [6] In these experiments, the free-carrier contribution to the real part \u03c3(\u03c9)\nof the optical conductivity is described by an \"anomalous\nDrude\" term [1]\n\u03c3(\u03c9) =\n\n\u0393\u2217 (\u03c9)\n\n+\n\n2\n\u03c9D\n/4\u03c0\n\u2217\n[m (\u03c9)/m]2 \u03c9 2 /\u0393\u2217 (\u03c9)\n\n,\n\nanomalous Drude approach of Eq. (1) and to the assumption that the mid-infrared absorption of cuprates is\ndominated by some anomalous Fermi liquid.\nHowever, the above picture leads to some inconsistencies. For instance, in Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+y samples with\nsimilar Tc 's, the pseudogap determined optically (\u223c 700\ncm\u22121 ) [6] is much larger than that found in angle-resolved\nphotoemission (0-260 cm\u22121 , depending on the direction\nin the k- space). [7] This discrepancy can hardly be explained, if one also considers that the optical absorption\nresults from an average on the Fermi surface. Moreover,\nan optical pseudogap is observed in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 , [4]\nalthough no such effect appears in the spin-lattice relaxation rate of this cuprate. [1] Finally, in the metallic spectra of Refs. [3\u20135] \u03c3(\u03c9) surprisingly decreases for \u03c9 \u2192 0,\nfor any T of the normal phase. This decrease is observed\non the low-frequency side of a strong FIR peak which\nis systematically associated with the observation of the\npseudogap. However, the FIR peak is attributed [3,4] to\nscattering of the free carriers by oxygen atoms randomly\ndistributed in the Cu-O planes. As this explanation does\nnot seem to be related to the existing theoretical models\nof the pseudogap, [1] the link between this latter and the\nFIR peak remains obscure.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9D is a constant plasma frequency, while both\nthe scattering rate \u0393\u2217 and the effective mass m\u2217 depend on the photon energy \u03c9. This model has been\noriginally introduced to fit the \u03c3(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 \u22121 law which\nreplaces the \u03c9 \u22122 behavior of conventional metals in the\nmid-infrared spectra of HCTS. The use of Eq. (1) leads\nto large scattering rates for the carriers in the cuprates.\nAt T \u223c T \u2217 , \u0393\u2217 \u2248 1500 cm\u22121 in the far infrared, for both\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 and HgBa2 Ca2 Cu3 O8+y . Below T \u2217 , \u0393\u2217\ndecreases to \u223c 500 cm\u22121 in the former compound, to \u223c\n1000 cm\u22121 in the latter. [3,4] Thus, even if the opening\nof an optical pseudogap below T \u2217 is displayed by \u03c3(\u03c9),\nits amplitude is generally extracted from the above drop\nin the far-infrared (FIR) part of \u0393\u2217 (\u03c9). The idea of an\noptical pseudogap is therefore intrinsically related to the\n\nA first hint comes from the optical conductivity of\nNd1.88 Ce0.12 CuO4 (NCCO), partially reported in Ref.\n[8]. A peak develops in the infrared, which softens considerably as T is lowered. This shift causes at higher\nenergies a depression in \u03c3(\u03c9) around 1000 cm\u22121 , very\nsimilar to the pseudogap reported by the authors cited\nabove. This suggests that, in NCCO, the optical pseudogap opens by a transfer of spectral weight to the FIR\npeak as this softens and narrows, as requested by ordinary sum rules. One should then focus on this peak at\nfinite frequency, attributed in NCCO to charges bound\n1\n\n\fto the lattice via a polaronic coupling. [8] However,\nNd1.88 Ce0.12 CuO4 is electron doped and semiconducting, even if very close to the insulator-to-metal transition. In order to study in greater detail a system where\nthe \"anomalous-Drude + pseudogap\" model has already\nbeen applied [2] and with the lowest carrier density, we\nhave measured the reflectivity of Bi2 Sr2 CuO6 (BSCO),\nfrom 400 to 8 K and from 15,000 to 10 cm\u22121 .\nBy extending the measurements in BSCO to the veryfar-infrared region of frequencies, we have first resolved\nfrom the FIR peak a normal Drude contribution which\nis in agreement with the dc conductivity, \u03c3dc , and the\nLondon penetration depth of the material. Basing on\nthese results we show that, at least in BSCO: i) \u03c3(\u03c9, T )\ncannot be explained in terms of a one-component model\nlike the anomalous Drude of Eq. (1); ii) the pseudogap\ndoes not open in the continuum of states of some kind\nof (anomalous) free carrier. On the contrary, we show\nthat: i) only the coexistence of two type of carriers may\naccount for the optical absorption; ii) the optical pseudogap is an effect created by the temperature-dependent\nabsorption of some weakly bound charges. In such context, the phase-separation model proposed by Emery and\nKivelson [9] is found to be in good agreement with the\npresent observations.\nThe sample investigated here is a thick BSCO film,\nhighly oriented with the c-axis orthogonal to the surface.\nIt has been grown by liquid phase epitaxy on a LaGaO3\nsubstrate. [10] Its resistivity \u03c1(T ), obtained from standard 4-points measurements, is reported by a full line in\nthe inset of Fig. 1. It shows a linear dependence on T\nfrom 300 to about 65 K, where a slight change of slope\nis observed. The superconducting transition has its onset at Tc = 20 K, with a width of 5 K. The \u03c1 value at\n300 K (1.4 \u00d710\u22123 \u03a9cm) is intermediate between that of\na good BSCO single crystal (0.3 \u00d710\u22123 \u03a9cm) [11] and\nthat of a polycrystalline pellet of the same material (2.7\n\u00d710\u22123 \u03a9cm). [12] This may be attributed to the presence of grain boundaries in the well oriented a \u2212 b plane\nof the present film. However, eventual grain boundaries\nare not expected to affect the infrared measurements.\nIndeed, the reflectivity R(\u03c9) of the BSCO film, relative to a gold-plated reference and reported in Fig. 1,\nis typical of the best single crystals. The R(\u03c9) spectra, with the electric field polarized in the a \u2212 b plane,\nwere collected using a Bomem DA8 interferometer coupled to the infrared synchrotron radiation beamline SIRLOIN of the LURE laboratory at Orsay. Helium-cooled\nbolometers, mercury-cadmium-tellurium or silicon detectors were used, depending on the frequency range under\ninvestigation. The large size of the film (0.5x0.5 cm2 ) and\nthe good performances of the apparatus have allowed us\nto measure R(\u03c9) down to unusually low values of \u03c9 (\u223c\n10 cm\u22121 ). The film thickness (1.8 \u03bcm) was such that\nno correction for the substrate contribution to R(\u03c9) was\nneeded; see Fig. 1. Therefore, the optical conductivity\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9) was obtained by simple, canonical Kramers-Kronig\ntransformations of R(\u03c9). In the normal metallic phase\n(T > Tc ), R(\u03c9) has been extrapolated from \u03c9 = 10 cm\u22121\nto \u03c9 = 0 by a Drude-Lorentz fit, in the superconducting\nphase by a London conductivity, as usually done; see Ref.\n[13]. Moreover, R(\u03c9) has been extrapolated from 15,000\ncm\u22121 up to 320,000 cm\u22121 by using the data of Ref. [14],\nthat have been extended to higher frequencies by a \u03c9 \u22124\nlaw.\n1.0\n\nR(\u03c9)\n\nBi2Sr2CuO6\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nT (K)\n100\n200\n\n8K\n30\n200\n300\n400\n\n300\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n10\n\n\u03c1 (m\u03a9 cm)\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03c9 (cm-1)\n\n103\n\n104\n\nFIG. 1. Reflectivity R(\u03c9) of the BSCO film at five temperatures from 400 to 8 K. The inset shows the resistivity \u03c1(T ) of\nthe film from 300 K to 4 K. The open circles are the \u03c1 values\nobtained by extrapolating \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) in Fig. 3 to \u03c9 = 0.\n\nThe conductivities \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) corresponding to the raw\nreflectivities of Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2. At any\nT , \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) exhibits a broad band peaked in the far infrared (FIR peak). Its high-frequency side behaves as\n\u03c9 \u22121 up to 6000 cm\u22121 , as shown in the inset of Fig. 2\nfor T = 200 and 30 K. The tail of the FIR peak accounts, therefore, for the frequency dependence of the\nso-called anomalous-free-carrier absorption usually observed in metallic cuprates. The peak frequency (\u223c 800\ncm\u22121 at 400 K) increasingly softens and narrows as T is\nlowered, until it reaches 110 cm\u22121 at 30 K. In the mid\ninfrared, a broad pseudogap opens for T \u2192 0. This feature is less deep than that observed in other cuprates\n(see Refs. [3\u20135]), most likely because the doping of the\npresent BSCO sample is nearly optimal. This pseudogap\nis just due to the red shift and the narrowing of the FIR\npeak for decreasing T , which produce a transfer of spectral weight towards low frequencies. Indeed, the effective\nnumber of carriers per unit cell nef f is constant with T\nwithin a few percent, for all temperatures of the normal\nphase, see the inset in Fig. 3. nef f has been evaluated\nfrom the relation\nZ \u03c9max\n2m\u2217 V\nnef f =\n\u03c3(\u03c9) d\u03c9 ,\n(2)\n\u03c0e2 \u03c9min\nwhere V is the cell volume, \u03c9min = 10 cm\u22121 , \u03c9max =\n7500 cm\u22121 , and m\u2217 has been assumed equal to the free\n2\n\n\f4\n30K\n200\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n2\n\u03c9 (103 cm-1)\n\n\u03c3(\u03c9, T ) = \u03c3a + \u03c3b =\n\ne2 A\n\u03c72 (\u03c9, T ) + (e\u2217 )2 \u03c9\u03c72 (\u03c9, T ) (4)\n\u03c9\n\nwith\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\nThe results reported in Figs. 2 and 3 point towards a\nmulti-component model for \u03c3(\u03c9) and indicate a coexistence of free and bound charges. The latters may be polaronic in nature and may aggregate at low temperatures,\nas proposed for the NCCO system in Ref. [8]. Emery and\nKivelson [9] have presented a picture where free carriers are scattered by arrays of (dynamical) bound charges\nwhich carry local dipoles.

Optical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) of the BSCO film, as\nextracted from R(\u03c9) in Fig. 1 by Kramers-Kronig transformations. The inset shows that, on the high-frequency side of\nthe FIR peak, \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c9) is linear with \u03c9 both at 200 K and 30\nK.\n\n30K\n\nThe results of Fig. 2 are quite similar to those reported\nin Ref. [2] for a single crystal of BSCO with Tc = 8 K,\nwhose R(\u03c9) was measured from 12,000 to 50 cm\u22121 . However, as evident from Fig. 3 where the FIR \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) has\nbeen reported on an expanded scale, the extension of the\nspectra down to 10 cm\u22121 has allowed us to resolve a narrow, low-frequency absorption from the FIR peak. The\ndip separating these two components of \u03c3(\u03c9) is observed\nat all temperatures. It corresponds to a change of slope\nat \u223c 50 cm\u22121 in R(\u03c9), see Fig. 1, where no instrumental effects are present, e. g., beamsplitter transmittance\nminima or data file overlaps. The low-frequency component of the absorption increases for \u03c9 \u2192 0, extrapolates\nto the \u03c3dc (T ) values measured in the same sample (full\ntriangles), and disappears below Tc . The open circles\nin Fig. 3 show that this feature, presumably peaked at\n\u03c9 = 0, is very well fitted at 30 K by a normal Drude term\n\u03c3(\u03c9) =\n\n2\n\u03c9D\n/4\u03c0\n,\n\u0393D + \u03c9 2 /\u0393D\n\n\u0393p\n.\n\u03932p + \u03c9 2\n\n(5)\n\nIn Eq. (4), \u03c3b is the contribution of the bound charges,\nmodeled as c dipoles of charge e\u2217 . \u03c3a takes into account\nthe scattering of the free carriers of charge e by these\ndipoles. \u0393p determines both the FIR peak frequency and\nwidth, while A is a constant whose expression is reported\nin Ref. [9].\n\nneff\n\n\u03c3 (103\u03a9-1cm-1)\n\n2\n\n\u03c3-1(10-3\u03a9 cm)\n\nelectron mass.\n\n.2\n\n\u03c3 (103\u03a9-1cm-1)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n200\nT (K)\n\n8\n\n400\n\n200\n\n1\n\n300\n\n400\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\u03c9 (cm )\n\n600\n\n-1\n\nFIG. 3. Expansion in the FIR of the \u03c3(\u03c9) of Fig. 2. The\nopen circles are the best fit to a normal Drude term, given by\nEq. (3), here proposed only for the 30 K curve. The dots and\nthe squares are best fits of Eqs. (4) and (5) to data at 8 K and\n200 K, respectively. The triangles on the ordinate axis represent the values of \u03c3dc measured at the same temperatures,\nalso reported in the inset of Fig. 1.\n\n(3)\n\nwith plasma frequency \u03c9D = 2100 cm\u22121 and scattering\nrate \u0393D = 35 cm\u22121 . At 100 (200) K one obtains, instead,\n\u03c9D = 1800 (1600) cm\u22121 and \u0393D = 35 (40) cm\u22121 . If one\nextrapolates the Drude fits to obtain \u03c3(0, T ) at all temperatures, one obtains the values reported by open circles\nin the inset of Fig. 1 together with the dc resistivity (full\nline) measured in the same sample. The agreement is\nwithin a few percent.\n\nEquation (4) was compared unsuccessfully with the optical conductivity measured in La2 CuO4+y . [15] On the\ncontrary, good fits of Eq. (4) to the present BSCO data\n3\n\n\fThe present observations strongly support the coexistence of free and weakly bound charges in BSCO, responsible for the normal Drude absorption and the FIR\npeak, respectively. This latter is very similar to the polaronic feature observed in semiconducting cuprates at low\ndoping. Its softening for decreasing T , followed by a saturation below T \u223c 150 K, has already been attributed in\nNd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 to the formation of polaronic aggregates.\nThis approach is confirmed by the present observations\nin BSCO, which are remarkably well fitted by a phaseseparation model based on the scattering of the free carriers by dynamical arrays of weakly bound charges.\nWe thank G. Balestrino for providing the sample here\ninvestigated. We are also indebted to C. Di Castro, R.\nGonnelli, and M. Grilli for useful discussions.\n\nare obtained at all temperatures, as reported in Fig. 3\nfor T > Tc (200 K) and T < Tc (8 K). Remarkably, by\nusing the two parameters c and \u0393p (whose values are 230\ncm\u22121 at 200 K, 135 cm\u22121 at 8 K), one reproduces the\nDrude term, the asymmetric FIR peak, and the softening\nand narrowing of this latter for decreasing T .\nBelow Tc the Drude peak disappears from the measuring range and the FIR peak looses the intensity corresponding to the underlying Drude tail. This effect, which\nhas been reproduced in the fit by fixing \u03c3a (\u03c9, T = 8K)\n= 0, allows one to perform a further check of the present\nanalysis. In fact, the loss of spectral weight observed below Tc in Fig. 3 provides an estimate of the London penetration depth in the film, as given by the Ferrell-Glover\nsum rule [16]\n\u03bb2L =\n\n8\n\nR \u03c9max\n\u03c9min\n\nc2\n,\n[\u03c3n (\u03c9, 30K) \u2212 \u03c3s (\u03c9, 8K)] d\u03c9\n\n(6)\n\nwhere here c is the speed of light and the other symbols\nhave a obvious meaning. For \u03c9min = 10 cm\u22121 and \u03c9max\n= 15,000 cm\u22121 one obtains \u03bbL = 300 \u00b1 10 nm, a value in\nexcellent agreement with that obtained for Bi2 Sr2 CuO6\nfrom transport measurements (310 nm). [11] On the other\nhand, no estimate of the superconducting gap can be\nmade, due to the strong FIR peak which overshadows\nthe collapse of the Drude component below Tc .\nIn conclusion, the present far-infrared study of BSCO\nquestions the widely accepted \"anomalous Drude + pseudogap\" model, through the identification in \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) of a\nnarrow, normal Drude absorption well resolved from a\nbroad FIR peak. The small value of the free-carrier scattering rate (\u0393D < 50 cm\u22121 ) is consistent with a metal\nin an extremely clean limit, where the carriers move in\nwell ordered, nearly defect-free Cu-O planes. Comparable values of \u0393D can be obtained in doped semiconductors by the technique of \"modulation doping,\" namely,\nby spatially separating the impurities, which provide the\nfree carriers, from the planes where these latters are free\nto move. In BSCO the Cu-O planes seem then to be\nvery clean, while the eventual impurities and defects are\nmostly distributed out-of-plane.\nThe \u03c9 \u22121 dependence of \u03c3(\u03c9) in the mid infrared, often invoked to justify the need for an anomalous Drude\nmodel, is due to the tail of the peak centered at finite\nfrequencies and should be ascribed to the bound charges.\nSimilarly, the optical pseudogap (see Fig. 2) is a depression in \u03c3(\u03c9) created by the bound-charge absorption as\nthis latter narrows and softens for decreasing T . This\neffect is required by the conservation of nef f with temperature, here fulfilled within a few percent. In this respect, any optical determination of the temperature T \u2217\nwhere the pseudogap starts opening seems questionable,\nas typically the FIR peak is observed even at T > T \u2217 .\n\n[1] For a review see T.
