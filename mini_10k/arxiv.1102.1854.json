Introduction\nOne of the most exciting mathematical implications of string theory is mirror symmetry, which finds\nits origin in the papers [Di] and [LVW]. A phenomenological verification of the conjecture that Calabi\u2013\nYau manifolds should appear in pairs was given in [CRL], and the first non trivial examples of mirror\npairs appeared in [GP]. In [GP] it was also discovered that mirror symmetry can be used to compute\nthe instanton corrections to the Yukawa couplings (the first explicit computations were carried out\nin [CDGP]), which mathematically corresponds to determine the number of rational curves of given\ndegree embedded in the Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. This led to the notion of Gromov-Witten invariants\nand more generally to the one of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants [GV1], [GV2].\nCuriously, in the seminal paper [CHSW], where the relevance of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds in string\ntheory was established, among the few explicit known examples of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds there was\nthe manifold Z, realized as the desingularization of the quotient E 3 /\u03c63 , with \u03c63 = \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6\nand \u03c6 the generator of Z3 which acts on the elliptic curve E. As Z is a rigid manifold, it cannot\nadmit a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold as mirror partner. This created a puzzle in the general framework of\nmirror symmetry. However, physically, mirror symmetry arises as a complete equivalence between\nconformal field theories. In this respect, it should not be surprising that in certain exceptional cases\nthe equivalence could involve more general spaces. Indeed, in [CDP] it was proposed that the mirror of\nZ should be a cubic in P8 quotiented by a suitable finite group. By using the usual mirror methods, the\nauthors were able to reproduce the right Yukawa couplings of Z. The mirror symmetry generalized to\nrigid Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds has been considered also in [S], where the mirror is presented as (embedded\nin) an higher dimensional Fano variety having the mirror diamond as an embedded sub-diamond and\nin [AG] where it is related to toric geometry. However, a definitive understanding of the question is\nstill open.\nIn this paper, as a preparation to further work on generalized mirror symmetry, we present a very\ndetailed study of the rigid manifold Z. Section 1 is devoted to an explicit description of the cohomology of Z. The Hodge diamond of this threefold is very well known, but here we identify a set\nof generators of P ic(Z) made up of surfaces and a set of generators of H 4 (Z, Q) made up of curves.\nOur goal is to describe the trilinear intersection form on the generators of P ic(Z) relating it with the\ntrilinear intersection form on P ic(E 3 ). Indeed the generators of P ic(Z) are of two types: the ones\ncoming from the generators of P ic(E 3 ) and the ones coming from the resolution of the singularities\nof E 3 /\u03c63 . The intersection between two divisors of different type is zero, and the trilinear form on\nthe divisors coming from E 3 is, up to a constant, the trilinear form P ic(E 3 ). For this reason it is\nimportant to give a good description of the trilinear form on P ic(E 3 ): in (4) the cubic self-intersection\nform is given for each divisor in P ic(E 3 ). In Section 2, Theorem 2.1, we prove that it can be given\nin terms of the determinant of a matrix in M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]), \u03b6 3 = 1. The locus where the determinant\nKey words: Rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds, Mirror symmetry.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nvanishes is a singular cubic in P8 . We recall that the Yukawa coupling on H 1,1 is strongly related with\nthe cup product on H 1,1 and thus with the intersection form on P ic(E 3 ). Moreover the locus where\nthe Yukawa coupling vanishes corresponds to fermion mass generation points.\nIn the second part of the paper, in Section 3, we describe some projective models of Z. Here we will\nlimit ourselves to make some basic observation on mirror symmetry, deferring a systematic analysis to\na future paper. We give a detailed description of the images of three maps (called m0 , m1 , m2 ) defined\nfrom Z to projective spaces and we relate these to earlier work. None of the maps mi , i = 0, 1, 2,\ngives an embedding. For this reason, we also prove that a certain divisor on Z is very ample (cf.\nProposition 3.5), i.e it defines a map m such that m(Z) \u2243 Z.\nThe maps mi , i = 0, 1, 2, allow us to describe some peculiarities of Z. The map m0 is 3 : 1 and\nit gives a model of another rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefold Y, birational to Z/Z3 . Moreover m0 (Z) is\ncontained in the Fermat cubic hypersurface in P8 and this could give a geometrical interpretation\nof the conjectures on the generalized mirrors of the rigid Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds Z and Y presented in\n[CDP] and [KLS]. The map m1 contracts 27 rational curves on Z, and gives a model of Z embedded\nin P11 . This model will be used in Section 5 to obtain other Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds. The map m2 was\nalready defined by Kimura, [K], to show that there exists a birational map between Z and a particular\ncomplete intersection of two cubics in P5 , called V3,3 . Several models of the variety V3,3 were analyzed\npreviously (cf. [Hi], [WvG], [M]).\nWe already observed that the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold Z is very well known, but it can be used to\nconstruct several other Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds, which are not always rigid. In Section 4 we recall constructions which produce Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds starting from a given one. In Section 5 we apply one\nof these constructions (described in [Fr]) to Z and we obtain non rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. The\nidea is to contract some curves on Z and then to consider the smoothing of the singular threefold\nobtained. One of the Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds constructed in this section does not appear in the list\nof known Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with small Hodge numbers given in [BCD] and is a new Calabi\u2013Yau\nvariety.\nf3 , Z and their cohomology\n1. The 3-folds E 3 , E\n\nIn this note we will analyze the properties of the very well known Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z introduced\nindependently in [B, Example 2] and [SW]. In order to describe the trilinear form on P ic(Z) (cf. (8)),\nwhich is strongly related to the Yukawa coupling, we will compute the cohomology of Z (Section 1.3)\nand of the varieties involved in its construction (Sections 1.1 and 1.2).\nTo fix the notation we recall some definitions and the construction of Z.\nDefinition 1.1. A smooth compact complex variety X is called a Calabi\u2013Yau variety if it is a K\u00e4hler\nvariety, it has a trivial canonical bundle and hi,0 (X) = 0 for 0 < i < dim(X).\nTo give the Hodge diamond of a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold X one has to find h1,1 (X) and h2,1 (X). We recall\nthat h2,1 (X) is the dimension of the family of deformations of X (which are indeed unobstructed by\nthe Tian\u2013Todorov theorem), so X has h2,1 (X) complex moduli.\nLet E be the Fermat elliptic curve x3 + y 3 + z 3 = 0, i.e the elliptic curve admitting a complex\nmultiplication of order 3. We will denote by \u03c6 : E \u2192 E the automorphism of E given by (x, y, z) 7\u2192\n(x, y, \u03b6z), where \u03b6 is a primitive third root of unity. Let E 3 be the Abelian 3-fold E \u00d7 E \u00d7 E and\n\u03c63 be the automorphism \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6 acting as \u03c6 on each factor of E 3 . The automorphism \u03c6 has three\nfixed points on E, which are called pi := (\u22121 : \u03b6 i : 0), i = 1, 2, 3. Hence \u03c63 fixes 27 points on E 3 ,\npi,j,k := (pi ; pj ; pk ), i, j, k = 1, 2, 3. Let \u03b1 : E 3 \u2192 E 3 /\u03c63 be the quotient map.

The exceptional locus consists of 27 disjoint copies of P2 , and\nthe exceptional divisor over the point pi,j,k will be denoted by ^\nBi,j,k . The automorphism \u03c63 of E 3\nf3 .

From the previous considerations it follows immediately\nthat:\n3\n3\nX\nX\nc0 (Z) = 1, c1 (Z) = 0, c2 (Z) =\n(\u03bbh fh + \u03bch dh + \u03bdh gh ) +\n\u03b1i,j,k li,j,k , c3 (Z) = \u03c7(Z) = 72,\nh=1\n\ni,j,k=1\n\n\f8\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nwhere \u03bbh , \u03bch , \u03bdh , \u03b1i,j,k \u2208 Q. It remains to determine the coefficients of the linear combination defining\nc2 . To do this we need the following result:\nLemma 1.1. ([Fr, Lemma 4.4]) If X is a complex 3-fold with trivial canonical bundle and S is a\nsmooth complex surface in X, then c2 (X)[S] = \u2212c1 (S)2 + c2 (S).\n\nWe now apply this result to each generator of P ic(Z). As the divisors Bi,j,k are isomorphic to P2 ,\none has c1 (Bi,j,k ) = 3li,j,k and c2 (Bi,j,k ) = \u03c7(P2 ) = 3. The divisors Fi , Di , Gi are isomorphic to the\nAbelian surface E \u00d7 E (indeed the map \u03c0 is 1 : 1 between the Abelian surface Fei \u2243 E \u00d7 E and Fi are\nisomorphic to E \u00d7 E, similarly Di and Gi ). Hence their first Chern class is zero (since their canonical\nbundle is trivial) and their second Chern class is 0 (since it is equal to their Euler characteristic).\nNow we compute the coefficients in c2 (Z) as in Example 1.1. Indeed using (3) and (9) one has:\n=\nand\n=\n\n\u22126 = \u2212c1 (Bx,y,z )2 + c2 (Bx,y,z ) = c2 (Z)[B\n\u0011 x,y,z ] =\nP\ni,j,k \u03b1i,j,k li,j,k [Bx,y,z ] = \u22123\u03b1x,y,z ,\nh=1 (\u03bbh fh + \u03bch dh + \u03bdh gh ) +\n\n\u0010P\n3\n\n0 = \u2212c1 (F1 )2 + c2 (F1 ) = c2\u0011(Z)[F1 ] =\nP\nh=1 (\u03bbh fh + \u03bch dh + \u03bdh gh ) +\ni,j,k \u03b1i,j,k li,j,k [F1 ] = 3(\u03bb1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bc3 + \u03bd2 + \u03bd3 )\n\n\u0010P\n3\n\nDoing this for all divisors we obtain \u03bbh = \u03bch = \u03bdh = 0, thus:\nc2 (Z) = 2\n\n3\nX\n\nli,j,k .\n\ni,j,k=1\n\nRemark 1.1. Considering Example 1.1, it isP\nimmediate to see that the second Chern class c2 (Z) is\ndivisible by 6 in H 4 (Z, Z), indeed c2 (Z)/6 = i,j,k=1,2,3 li,j,k /3 = \u2212M 2 \u2208 H 4 (Z, Z). The divisibility\nof this class was already obtained in a different and more involved way by Lee and Oguiso, [LO].\nThe computation of the second Chern class of Z allows also to write down explicitly the Riemann-Roch\ntheorem for the divisors on Z. Indeed it is well known (cf.

More on the trilinear form on P ic(E 3 )\nTo compute the Yukawa coupling on Z it is necessary to describe the trilinear form on P ic(Z). We\nproved in the previous section that the trilinear form of P ic(Z) depends on the trilinear form on\nP ic(E 3 ) (cf. (8), (14)). For this reason we now give a different description of the trilinear form on\nP ic(E 3 ): we reduce the computation of this trilinear form to the computation of a determinant of\na matrix in M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]) (cf. 13). More precisely in this section we give a way to associate to each\ndivisor L on E 3 a matrix \u03a9L in M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]) and we prove the following theorem:\nt\nTheorem 2.1. There exists a homomorphism of groups \u03bc : P ic(E 3 ) \u2192\n\u221a {H \u2208 M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]) | H =\n1\n3\n3\n\u2212H} \u2282 M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]) such that, for each divisor L \u2208 P ic(E ), L = 12 \u22123det(\u03bc(L)).\n\nWe already said (Section 1.1) that a divisor D on an Abelian variety A \u2243 Rn /\u039b corresponds to a\n2-form c1 (D) and hence to a skew\u2013symmetric form ED on the lattice \u039b taking values in Z.\nThe elliptic curve E is obtained as C/Z[\u03b6]. Since we are considering the Abelian variety E 3 , in this\ncontext \u039b \u2243 Z[\u03b6]3 , and we are saying that each divisor D in P ic(E 3 ) defines a skew-symmetric form\nED : Z[\u03b6]3 \u00d7 Z[\u03b6]3 \u2192 Z.\nFirst of all we prove that for each L \u2208 P ic(E 3 ) there exists a matrix \u03a9L , such that for each x, y \u2208 Z[\u03b6]3 ,\n\n\fA RIGID CALABI\u2013YAU 3-FOLD\n\n9\n\nEL (x, y) = T r(t x\u03a9L y), where T r is the trace of an element in Q[\u03b6] over Q defined as T r(a + \u03b6b) =\n(a + \u03b6b) + (a + \u03b6b) = 2a \u2212 b for a, b \u2208 Q. Since EL (x, y) = \u2212EL (y, x), T \u03a9L = \u2212\u03a9L .\nTo compute the matrix \u03a9L for each of the nine divisors L which generate the Picard group of E 3 , we\nuse the same technique considered in Section 1.1, i.e we consider divisors which generate P ic(E 3 ) as\npull-back of divisors on an elliptic curve E. Indeed, since the map c1 : P ic(X) \u2192 H 2 (X, Z) commutes\nwith the pull back, we have that if L \u2208 P ic(E 3 ) is \u03b1\u2217 (l) for a certain map \u03b1 : E 3 \u2192 E and a certain\ndivisor l \u2208 P ic(E), then EL (x, y) = El (\u03b1(x), \u03b1(y)).\nLet us \u0014consider the\n\u0015 elliptic curve E = C/Z[\u03b6] and a general point P \u2208 E. Then c1 (P ) is the skew-form\n0 1\nEP =\n(the unique, up to a constant, skew-form on \u039b). So EP (a + \u03b6b, c + \u03b6d) = ad \u2212 bc.\n\u22121 0\nThe matrix \u03a9P is a 1 \u00d7 1 matrix with entries in Q[\u03b6] (i.e \u03a9P \u2208 Q[\u03b6]) such that\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\nc\nT r((a + \u03b6b)\u03a9L (c + \u03b6d)) = (a, b)\n= ad \u2212 bc.\n\u22121 0\nd\nThis gives \u03a9P = \u03c1 (=\u2212t \u03a9P ) where \u03c1 := (\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6)/3.\nThe matrix \u03a9L for a certain divisor L \u2208 P ic(E 3 ) was identified by the property EL (v, w) = T r(t v\u03a9L w),\nP3\nhence to compute it, we consider \u03b1 : E 3 \u2192 E, \u03b1 : (z1 , z2 , z3 ) 7\u2192 i=1 ai zi , where zi are the complex coordinates on the i-th copy of E. LetPa := (a1 , a2 , a3 ) and analogously\nv := (v1 , v2 , v3 ),\nP\nt\nt\nt\nw := (w1 , w2 , w3 ). Let L = \u03b1\u2217 (P ), \u03b1(v) =\ni ai wi = a w (where b is\ni ai vi = a v, \u03b1(w) =\nthe transpose of the vector b). Then\nEL (v, w) = EP (\u03b1(v), \u03b1(w)) = EP (at v, at w) = T r(t (at v)\u03c1at w) = T r(v t a\u03c1at w).\n\nwhich implies that the matrix \u03a9L associated to L = \u03b1\u2217 (P ) is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na1\n(12)\n\u03a9L := \u03c1 \uf8ed a2 \uf8f8 (a1 , a2 , a3 )\na3\n\nThus to find, for example, \u03a9\u03931 it suffices to apply (12) to the map \u03b71 : (z1 , z2 , z3 ) 7\u2192 \u03b6z2 \u2212 z3 :\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1 \u2212\u03b6 \uf8fb .\n\u03a9\u03931 = \u03c1 \uf8ed \u03b6 \uf8f8 (0, \u03b6, \u22121) = \u03c1 \uf8f0 0\n\u22121\n1\n0 \u2212\u03b6\n\nSimilarly one finds \u03a9\u03a6i , \u03a9\u2206i and \u03a9\u0393i (the map associated to each of these divisors is given in (1)). In\nP3\nthis way one finds that if L = i=1 (ai \u03a6i + bi \u2206i + ci \u0393i ), then \u03a9L = ai \u03a9\u03a6i + bi \u03a9\u2206i + ci \u03a9\u0393i is given by\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\na1 + b 2 + b 3 + c2 + c3\n\u2212b3 \u2212 \u03b6c3\n\u2212b2 \u2212 \u03b6c2\n\uf8fb.\n(13)\n\u03a9L = \u03c1 \uf8f0\na2 + b 1 + b 3 + c1 + c3\n\u2212b1 \u2212 \u03b6c1\n\u2212b3 \u2212 \u03b6c3\na3 + b 1 + b 2 + c1 + c2\n\u2212b2 \u2212 \u03b6c2\n\u2212b1 \u2212 \u03b6c1\n\nNow an explicit computation shows that for each divisor L \u2208 P ic(E 3 ), the determinant of \u03a9L is, up\nto a constant, the intersection form computed in (4),\n(14)\n\n3\nX\n1\u221a\nL =\n\u22123det( (ai \u03a9\u03a6i + bi \u03a9\u2206i + ci \u03a9\u0393i ))\n12\ni=1\n3\n\nand this concludes the proof of Theorem 2.1.\n\nRemark 2.1. The compatibility between the group structures of P ic(E 3 ) and M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]) is due\nto the properties of the skew symmetric form EL defined by a divisor L and of the trace T r. Indeed\nEL\u2297M (x) = EL (x) + EM (x) = T r(t x\u03a9L x) + T r(t x\u03a9M x) = T r(t x(\u03a9L + \u03a9M )x), and so to the line\nbundle L \u2297 M we associate the matrix \u03a9L + \u03a9M .\n\nWe observe that the Picard group of the singular quotient E 3 /\u03c63 has rank 9 and is induced by the\none on P ic(E 3 ). The Picard group of E 3 /\u03c63 can be identified with the subgroup of P ic(Z) generated\nby Fi , Di , Gi . In Section 1.3 we proved that the trilinear intersection form on hFi , Di , Gi ii=1,2,3 \u2282\nP ic(Z) is, up to a constant (multiplication by 9), the trilinear form on P ic(E 3 ). We deduce that the\n\n\f10\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\ntrilinear form on P ic(E 3 /\u03c63 ) is, up to a constant, the determinant of the matrix as in (13). Since\nH 2,0 (E 3 /\u03c63 ) = 0, P ic(E 3 /\u03c63 )\u2297C \u2243 H 1,1 (E 3 /\u03c63 ) and the cup product on H 1,1 (E 3 /\u03c63 ) coincides with\nthe C-linear extension of the trilinear form. So the cup product on H 1,1 (E 3 /\u03c63 ) can be represented\nas determinant of a matrix in M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]). This is of a certain interest because of its relation\nwith the Yukawa coupling on H 1,1 (E 3 /\u03c63 ), obtained as the sum of the cup product and another\naddend, involving the Gromov\u2013Witten invariants. The values of ai , bi , ci where the determinant of\nthe matrix (13) is zero correspond to (1, 1) forms where the cup product is zero. The set of such\nP3\nvalues is described by the cubic C3 := V (det( i=1 (ai \u03a9\u03a6i + bi \u03a9\u2206i + ci \u03a9\u0393i ))) in P8 (projective space\nwith coordinates (a1 : a2 : a3 : b1 : b2 : b3 : c1 : c2 : c3 )). This cubic is singular where the matrix\nP3\n8\ni=1 (ai \u03a9\u03a6i + bi \u03a9\u2206i + ci \u03a9\u0393i ) has rank 1, hence along the intersection of the nine quadrics in P\ndefined by requiring that the nine 2 \u00d7 2 minors of the matrix are zero. The matrices of rank 1 are of\ntype \u03c1(t a)(a) for a certain vector a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ). We already showed that the matrix associated to\nthe divisors \u03a6i , \u2206i , \u0393i are of this type and hence they correspond to singular points of the cubic. We\nnotice that these divisors define a fibration on the 3-fold.\nRemark 2.2. Let Y be a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold. In [W], the cubic hypersurface W in P(P ic(Y ) \u2297 C),\nconsisting of the points representing divisors L with L3 = 0, is analyzed. Here we are considering the\ncubic C3 defined in the same way as W , but in the case of the Abelian variety E 3 . By the relations\nbetween P ic(E 3 ) and P ic(Z) given in Section 1.3, the cubic C3 is also related to the cubic W in case\nY = Z.\n3. Projective models of Z\nThe aim of this section is to give explicit relations and equations for Z. To do this we describe\nsome (singular) projective models of the 3-fold Z and more in general maps f : Z \u2192 PN . Each of\nthese maps is associated to a line bundle L := f \u2217 (OPN (1)), and hence f is given by global sections\ns0 , . . . sN \u2208 H 0 (Z, L), i.e f : z 7\u2192 (s0 (z) : . . . sN (z)).\nOur strategy will be to construct line bundles L (and maps mL associated to L) on E 3 and use these\nto induce line bundles (and hence maps) on Z. Let L be a line bundle on E 3 such that \u03c6\u22173 L \u2243 L. Then\n\u03c6\u22173 acts on H 0 (E 3 , L) and hence the space H 0 (E 3 , L) is naturally decomposed in three eigenspaces\nH 0 (E 3 , L)0 , H 0 (E 3 , L)1 , H 0 (E 3 , L)2 . By construction the maps (mL )0 : E 3 \u2192 P(H 0 (E 3 , L)0 ),\n(mL )1 : E 3 \u2192 P(H 0 (E 3 , L)1 ), (mL )2 : E 3 \u2192 P(H 0 (E 3 , L)2 ) identify points on E 3 which are in the\nf3 )\nsame orbit for \u03c63 . This implies that these maps (or better the maps induced by these maps on E\nare well defined on Z and thus are associated to line bundles on Z. It is moreover clear that the map\n(mL )\u01eb , \u01eb = 0, 1, 2, is the composition of E 3 \u2192 mL (E 3 ) followed by the projection of mL (E 3 ) on the\nsubspace P(H 0 (E 3 , L))\u01eb . First of all we point out the relations between the line bundle and its global\nsections on E 3 and on Z and then we focus our attention on a specific case.\nRemark 3.1. We said that the space H 0 (E 3 , L) is naturally decomposed in eigenspaces by the action\nof \u03c6\u22173 , and indeed there are three subspaces of H 0 (E 3 , L) such that the action of \u03c63 is the same on all\nthe elements in the same subspace and is different on two elements chosen in two different subspaces.\nHowever the choice of the eigenvalue of each eigenspace is not canonical, but depends on the lift of\n\u03c6\u22173 on H 0 (E 3 , L) chosen.\n\nLemma 3.1. ([BHPV, Lemma I.17.2]) Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 Y be an n-cyclic covering of Y branched along a\nsmooth divisor C and determined by OY (L), where L is a divisor such that OY (nL) \u2243 OY (C).

Let (P26 )\u01eb be the eigenspace for the eigenvalue \u03b6 \u01eb ,\n26\n26\n\u01eb = 0, 1, 2 for \u03c63 . The composition of m3\u03a6 with projection P26 \u2192 P26\n0 (resp. P1 , P2 ) is the map\ndefined on Z which is associated to the divisor F (resp. F \u2212 M , F \u2212 2M ).\nProof. The diagram:\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nf3\nf3 , 3\u03b2 \u2217 (\u03a6))\n\u2190 E\nH 0 (E 3 , 3\u03a6) \u2192 H 0 (E\n\u2217\n\u2193 \u03c0 induces\n\u2191\u03c0\nZ\nH 0 (Z, F )\n\u2217\n\nE3\n\nThe map \u03b2 \u2217 is an isomorphism. A section s \u2208 H 0 (E 3 , 3\u03a6) with divisor D which has multiplicity \u03b1i,j,k\ne\ne +P\n^\nin the point pi,j,k pulls back to a section \u03b2 \u2217 s with divisor \u03b2 \u2217 D = D\ni,j,k \u03b1i,j,k Bi,j,k , where D is the\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nstrict transform of D. Since 3\u03b2 (\u03a6) = \u03c0 (F ), using (16) and (17), we have \u03c0\u2217 (3\u03b2 (\u03a6)) = F \u2297 \u03c0\u2217 OZ\nand\nf3 , 3\u03b2 \u2217 (\u03a6)) = H 0 (Z, F \u2297 \u03c0\u2217 OZ ) = H 0 (Z, F ) \u2295 H 0 (Z, F (\u2212M )) \u2295 H 0 (Z, F (\u22122M )).\nH 0 (E\nThus\n\n\u2217\n\n(18)\n\n\u03b2\nf3 , 3\u03b2 \u2217 \u03a6) \u2243 H 0 (Z, F ) \u2295 H 0 (Z, F \u2212 M ) \u2295 H 0 (Z, F \u2212 2M )\nH 0 (E 3 , 3\u03a6) \u2243 H 0 (E\n\nand the last decomposition is a decomposition in eigenspaces of H 0 (E 3 , 3\u03a6). So H 0 (Z, F \u2212 aM ) \u2282\nH 0 (E 3 , 3\u03a6) corresponds to the space of the sections of 3\u03a6 on E 3 with zeros with multiplicity at least\na in the points pi,j,k and which are in the same eigenspace for \u03c63 . The map associated to 3\u03a6 is very\nexplicit: Every elliptic curve is embedded in P2 as a cubic, by the linear system associated to the\ndivisor 3P . In particular the curve E has the curve x3 + y 3 + z 3 = 0 as image in P2x,y,z . So we can\nembed E 3 in P2x1 ,y1 ,z1 \u00d7 P2x2 ,y2 ,z2 \u00d7 P2x3 ,y3 ,z3 (embedding each factor of E 3 in the corrispondent copy\nof P2 ). Now it is well known that there exists an embedding of P2 \u00d7 P2 \u00d7 P2 in P26 given by the Segre\nmap\ns : ((x1 : y1 : z1 ), (x2 : y2 : z2 ), (x3 : y3 : z3 )) \u2192 (x1 x2 x3 : x1 x2 y3 : x1 x2 z3 : x1 y2 x3 : . . . : z1 z2 z3 ).\n\nHence there is an embedding of E 3 in P26 which is the restriction of s to E 3 . By construction this map\nf3 which\nis associated to the very ample divisor 3\u03a6 on E 3 . This map extends to a map defined on E\n\u2217\n^\ncontracts the exceptional divisors B\ni,j,k (which are in fact orthogonal to the divisor \u03b2 (3\u03a6) defining\nthe map).\nThe action of the automorphism \u03c63 on E 3 is given by \u03c6 : ((x1 : y1 : z1 ), (x2 : y2 : z2 ), (x3 : y3 : z3 )) \u2192\n((x1 : y1 : \u03b6z1 ), (x2 : y2 : \u03b6z2 ), (x3 : y3 : \u03b6z3 )) and this automorphism extends to an automorphism on\nP26 . The eigenspaces with eigenvalue 1, \u03b6, \u03b6 2 for \u03c63 on P26 are\n(x1 x2 x3 : x1 x2 y3 : x1 y2 x3 : x1 y2 y3 : y1 x2 x3 : y1 x2 y3 : y1 y2 x3 : y1 y2 y3 : z1 z2 z3 )\n(z1 x2 x3 : z1 x2 y3 : z1 y2 x3 : z1 y2 y3 : x1 z2 x3 : x1 z2 y3 : y1 z2 x3 : y1 z2 y3 : x1 x2 z3 : x1 y2 z3 : y1 x2 z3 : y1 y2 z3 )\n(x1 z2 z3 : y1 z2 z3 : z1 x2 z3 : z1 y2 z3 : z1 z2 x3 : z1 z2 y3 )\n\n\f12\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nrespectively. We observe that the first eigenspace is defined by sections of 3\u03a6 which are not necessarily\nzero in the points pi,j,k (for example the monomial x1 x2 x3 is not zero in the points pi,j,k ), the second\nby sections passing through pi,j,k with multiplicity 1 and the third by sections passing through the\npoints pi,j,k with multiplicity 2. Hence the first eigenspace is identified (under the isomorphisms (18))\nwith H 0 (Z, F ), the second with H 0 (Z, F \u2212 M ) and the third with H 0 (Z, F \u2212 2M ).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2. From this description of H 0 (Z, F \u2212 kM ) we get\n\ndim(H 0 (Z, F )) = 9, dim(H 0 (Z, F \u2212 M )) = 12, dim(H 0 (Z, F \u2212 2M )) = 6.\n\nIf we apply the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem (cf. (11)) to the divisor F , F \u2212 M , F \u2212 2M , we find \u03c7(F ) = 9,\n\u03c7(F \u2212 M ) = 12, \u03c7(F \u2212 2M ) = 6. This in particular implies that for a divisor L among F , F \u2212 M ,\nF \u2212 2M , h2 (Z, L) \u2212 h1 (Z, L) = 0, indeed by Serre duality we have h3 (Z, L) = 0. For the divisors\nF and F \u2212 M this is a trivial consequence of the fact that they are big and nef, as we will see in\nPropositions 3.2 and 3.3, and of the Kawamata\u2013Viehweg vanishing theorem.\nRemark 3.3. Analogously we can consider the sections of the line bundles hF \u2212 kM , h, k \u2265 0, over\nZ. These correspond (as showed for F \u2212 kM ) to sections of 3h\u03a6 over E 3 which vanish at least of\ndegree k in the points pi,j,k . We denote by Nh,k the space of such a sections. In case k = 0, 1, 2 this\n0\n3\ngives a decomposition in eigenspaces\n\u03b6k.\n\u0010 of H (E\n\u0011 , h\u03a6)\u0010relative to the eigenvalue\n\u0011\nLet k = 0, 1, 2. We denote by\n\nSym h (E)\n\nk\n\n:=\n\nSym h < x, y, z >\n\nk\n\nthe monomials of degree h\n\nin the coordinates of E which belong to the eigenspace of the eigenvalue \u03b6 k . Now (Sym h (E))k is\ngenerated by the monomials of the form x\u03b1 y \u03b2 z \u03b3 such that \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 = h and \u03b3 \u2261 k mod 3. Since\nz 3 = \u2212x3 \u2212 y 3 on E, we can assume that \u03b3 = k. Thus the eigenspaces have the following dimensions:\ndim(Sym h (E))k = h + 1, h, h \u2212 1 for k = 0, 1, 2 respectively. The sections of 3h\u03a6 on E 3 are given\nby Sym h (E) \u00d7 Sym h (E) \u00d7 Sym h (E) and hence Nh,k = Sym h (E)a \u00d7 Sym h (E)b \u00d7 Sym h (E)c with\na, b, c = 0, 1, 2 and a + b + c \u2261 k mod 3. After direct computation we obtain the following dimensions\n\uf8f1\nk=0\n\uf8f2 9h3\n9h3 + 3 k = 1 ,\ndim(Nh,k ) =\n\uf8f3\n9h3 \u2212 3 k = 2\nwhich add up to H 0 (E 3 , 3h\u03a6) = (3h)3 .\nNow \u03c7(hF \u2212 kM ) = 9h3 + 32 k(3 \u2212 k 2 ) by the Riemann- Roch theorem (cf. (11)): we notice that\ndim(Nh,k ) equals \u03c7(hF \u2212 kM ) for k = 0, 1, 2, h > 0. This generalizes the result of Remark 3.2\nand allows one to describe projective models of Z obtained from the maps associated to the divisors\nhF \u2212 kM , for each h > 0, k = 0, 1, 2.\n\n3.1. The first eigenspace. We now analyze the projection to the eigenspace relative to the eigenvalue 1, i.e the map m0 on E 3 given by (x1 x2 x3 : x1 x2 y3 : x1 y2 x3 : x1 y2 y3 : y1 x2 x3 : y1 x2 y3 : y1 y2 x3 :\ny1 y2 y3 : z1 z2 z3 ).\nConsidering the coordinate functions of m0 , we observe that they are invariant not only under the action of \u03c63 , but also under the action of \u03c6 : ((x1 : y1 : z1 ), (x2 : y2 : z2 ), (x3 : y3 : z3 )) \u2192 ((x1 : y1 : \u03b6z1 ) ,\n(x2 : y2 : \u03b6 2 z2 ), (x3 : y3 : z3 )). It is easy to see that the map is 9 : 1 on E 3 , and hence the image\ngives a model of the Calabi\u2013Yau variety Y which desingularizes E 3 /h\u03c6, \u03c63 i. So Z is a 3 : 1 cover of\nm0 (E 3 ). The Calabi\u2013Yau Y, of which m0 (E 3 ) is a birational model, is still interesting, so we describe\nthe map m0 in some details. In this section we prove the following:\nProposition 3.2. The map m0 : E 3 \u2192 P8 is well defined on E 3 , and is a 9 : 1 map on its image. Its\ni\ndifferential fails to be injective only on the curves Cj,k\n(cf. Example 1.2).\n3\n1\n1\nThe variety m0 (E ) is a 3 : 1 cover of \u03c3(P \u00d7 P \u00d7 P1 ) where \u03c3 : P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 \u2192 P7 is the Segre\nembedding. Moreover m0 (E 3 ) is contained in the Fermat cubic hypersurface in P8 .\nThe map m0 induces the 3 : 1 map mF : Z \u2192 P8 associated to the nef and big divisor F .\nIt is immediate to check that the map m0 is 9 : 1. To analyze its differential, we first consider m0 as\ndefined on P2 \u00d7 P2 \u00d7 P2 and then we will restrict it to E 3 . We recall that P2 is covered by its open\n\n\fA RIGID CALABI\u2013YAU 3-FOLD\n\n13\n\nsubsets Ux := {(x : y : z)|x 6= 0}, Uy and Uz . Since the point (0 : 0 : 1) 6\u2208 E, it suffices to consider the\nopen sets Ux and Uy , but the map is totally symmetric in the xi and yi , so it is enough to study the\nmap on the open set Ux \u00d7 Ux \u00d7 Ux of P2 \u00d7 P2 \u00d7 P2 :\nUx\n\n\u00d7\n\nUx\n\n(y1 , z1 ) \u00d7 (y2 , z2 )\nThe Jacobian is given by\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7 (y3 , z3 )\n\uf8eb\n\nJm 0\n\n\u2212\u2192 U \u2282 C8\n\nUx\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\ny3\ny2\ny2 y3\n0\n\n\u0001\ny3 , y2 , y2 y3 , y1 , y1 y3 , y1 y2 , y1 y2 y3 , z1 z2 z3 .\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nz2 z3\n\n0\n1\ny3\n0\n0\ny1\ny1 y3\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nz1 z3\n\n1\n0\ny2\n0\ny1\n0\ny1 y2\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nz1 z2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nNow we restrict our attention to the tangent space to E 3 : the tangent vectors (u, v) to E in (y, z)\n\u2202f\n\u2202f \u2202f\n3\n3\nsatisfy u \u2202f\n\u2202y + v \u2202z = 0, where f = 1 + y + z is the equation of E in Ux , thus (u, v) = \u03bb(\u2212 \u2202z , \u2202y ) =\n\u03bb(\u22123z 2 , 3y 2 ), \u03bb \u2208 C.

On the other hand the condition z1 6= 0, zj = 0 for j 6= 1\n(resp. zi = 0 \u2200i) implies \u03bb = 0, but does not give conditions on \u03bc, \u03c1 (resp. \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03c1). We recall that\nthe condition zi = 0 gives exactly the fixed points pi on the i-th copy of E in E 3 . Therefore the map\nk\n(Jm0 )|E 3 , and also m0 , fails to be injective on the curves Ci,j\n(and in particular at the fixed points\npi \u00d7 pj \u00d7 pk ). The reason is that these curves are invariant not only under the action of \u03c63 , but also\nunder \u03c6.\nThe map m0 can also be described in a different way, which exhibits m0 (E 3 ) as 3 : 1 cover of a\nsubvariety in P7 . Consider the composition \u03b3 of the projection \u03b1 : E 3 \u2192 P1 of each elliptic curve\nE \u2282 P2 on the first two coordinates and the Segre embedding \u03c3 : (P1 )3 \u2192 P7\n\u03b3:\n\n\u03b1\n\nE3\n\u2192\nx3i + yi3 + zi3 = 0 7\u2192\n\nP1 \u00d7\nP1 \u00d7\n((x1 : y1 ), (x2 : y2 ),\n\n\u03c3\n\nP1\n\u2192\n(x1 : y1 )) 7\u2192\n\nP7\n(x1 x2 x3 : x1 x2 y3 : . . . : y1 y2 y3 )\n\nThe Segre map \u03c3 is well known to be an embedding and the map \u03b1 is clearly 33 : 1, hence \u03b3 is 33 : 1.\nLet us denote by X0 , . . . X8 the coordinates on the target projective space of the map m0 . The map \u03b3\nis the composition of projection of m0 with the projection on the hyperplane P7 \u2282 P8 with coordinates\nX0 , . . . , X7 . Thanks to this description one can show that m0 (E 3 ) is contained in certain quadrics\nand a cubic hypersurface. Indeed the variety \u03c3(P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 ) is contained in the quadrics\nX0 X3 = X1 X2 , X0 X5 = X1 X4 , X0 X7 = X2 X5 , X0 X7 = X1 X6 , X0 X6 = X2 X4 ,\nX0 X7 = X3 X4 , X1 X7 = X3 X5 , X2 X7 = X3 X6 , X4 X7 = X5 X6\n\nand since x3i + yi3 + zi3 = 0,we have \u2212(X8 )3 = \u2212(z1 z2 z3 )3 = \u2212(\u2212x31 \u2212 y13 )(\u2212x32 \u2212 y23 )(\u2212x33 \u2212 y33 ) =\nX03 + X13 + X23 + X33 + X43 + X53 + X63 + X73 , so m0 (E 3 ) is contained in the Fermat cubic in P8 ,\nP8\nF8 := V ( i=0 Xi3 ).\n\n\f14\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nIt is now clear that the projection (X0 : . . . : X8 ) \u2192 (X0 : . . . X7 ) restricted to F8 and to m0 (E 3 ) is a\ncyclic 3 : 1 map with cover transformation (X0 : . . . : X7 : X8 ) \u2192 (X0 : . . . : X7 : \u03b6X8 ).\nRemark 3.4. The map mF induced by m0 on Z does not contract curves. This guarantees that F is\na big and nef divisor, indeed F 3 > 0 (i.e F is big) and for each curve C \u2208 Z, F C = 3deg(mF (C)) > 0,\nand by [De, Theorem 1.26] this suffices to conclude that F is nef.\nThe inclusion m0 (E 3 ) \u2282 F8 is interesting in view of the paper [CDP] where the authors suggest\nthat a generalized mirror for the Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z is a quotient of the Fermat cubic in P8 by an\nautomorphism of order 3. Here we proved that there exists a 3 : 1 map from Z to a singular model of\n^3 which is contained in this cubic in P8 . The Hodge numbers of Y\nthe Calabi\u2013Yau variety Y = Z/Z\nare h1,1 = 84 and h2,1 = 0.\n^\nIn [CDP] the authors observe that the middle cohomology of the desingularization F\n8 /G of the quotient\nof F8 by certain groups G has the following Hodge numbers:\nH7 :\n\n(19)\n\n0 0 1 \u03b2 \u03b2 1 0 0.\n\nFor a certain choice of the action of the group G \u2243 Z3 , the value of \u03b2 is 36 and hence h4,3 (F8 /G) =\n^\n^\nh1,1 (Z). The space H 4,3 (F\n8 /G) is the complex moduli space of F8 /G and has the same dimension of\nthe K\u00e4hler moduli space of Z. Requiring that the dimension of the complex moduli space of a variety\ncoincides with the dimension of the K\u00e4hler moduli space of another variety is one of the necessary\nconditions for the two varieties to be mirrors. In [CDP] deeper relations between the complex moduli\n^\nof F\n8 /G and the K\u00e4hler moduli of Z are found using the Yukawa coupling. Because of this the authors\n\n^\nsuggest that F\n8 /G could be a \"generalized mirror\" of Z.\nNow we observe that, if G is trivial, then \u03b2 in (19) is 84 and h4,3 (F8 ) = h1,1 (Y). Thus we observe\nthat F8 has the Hodge numbers of the generalized mirror of Y (a desingularization of Z/Z3 ). This\nwas already noticed in [KLS, Section 6.1.3], where the authors analyze a deeper relation between Y\nand F8 based on their L-functions (cf. [KLS, Theorem 2]).\nWe observe that in these two generalized mirrors the desingularization of a quotient by Z3 is involved:\nCY\nZ\n^3\nY = Z/Z\n\nconjectured generalized mirror\nF^\n8 /Z3\nF8\n\nP8\nThe fact that the Calabi\u2013Yau variety Y admits a birational model inside the variety i=0 Xi3 = 0\nP8\n(and Z a 3 : 1 map to a subvariety of i=0 Xi3 = 0) could be useful to give a geometric explanation\nof the relations between Z and its generalized mirror and between Y and F8 .\n3.2. The second eigenspace. We now analyze the projection on the eigenspace of the eigenvalue\n\u03b6, i.e the map m1 on E 3 given by (z1 x2 x3 : z1 x2 y3 : z1 y2 x3 : z1 y2 y3 : x1 z2 x3 : x1 z2 y3 : y1 z2 x3 :\ny1 z2 y3 : x1 x2 z3 : x1 y2 z3 : y1 x2 z3 : y1 y2 z3 ). We summarize the properties of this map in the following\nProposition, which is proved in this section:\nProposition 3.3.

This condition gives no points where the differential is not injective.\nSimilarly, if z2 = 0, z3 6= 0, then \u03c1 = 0 and (by the previous argument) \u03bb = \u03bc = 0. On the contrary\nin case z2 = z3 = 0 one obtains \u03bc = \u03c1 = 0, but no conditions on \u03bb, which corresponds to curves where\ni\nthe differential is not injective. The curves Cj,k\nare contracted to 27 singular points of m1 (E 3 ), which\nare the only singular points of the image.\nIn order to prove that these singular points are ordinary double points we consider some relations\namong the coordinate functions Ni , for i = 0, . . . , 11, of m1 . There are 15 quadratic relations involving\nthese monomials which are induced by the Segre embedding:\nQi := V (N0 N2i+1 \u2212 N1 N2i ), i = 1, 2, 3\nQi := V (N1 N2i\u22123 \u2212 N3 N2(i\u22122) ), i = 6, 7\nQ10 := V (N4 N7 \u2212 N5 N6 )\nQi := V (N5 Ni\u22123 \u2212 N7 Ni\u22125 ), i = 13, 14\n\nQi := V (N0 N2i+1 \u2212 N2 N2i ), i = 4, 5\nQi := V (N2 N2i\u221211 \u2212 N3 N2(i\u22126) ), i = 8, 9\nQi := V (N4 Ni\u22121 \u2212 N6 Ni\u22123 ), i = 11, 12\nQ15 := V (N8 N11 \u2212 N9 N10 )\n\nWe observe that, due to x3i + yi3 + zi3 = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, we obtain also 6 cubic equations relating the\nmonomials:\n3\nC1 := V (N03 + N13 \u2212 (N83 + N10\n))\n3\n3\n3\nC4 := V (N1 + N3 \u2212 (N5 + N73 ))\n\n3\nC2 := V (N23 + N33 \u2212 (N93 + N11\n))\n3\n3\n3\nC5 := V (N4 + N5 \u2212 (N8 + N93 ))\n\nC3 := V (N03 + N23 \u2212 (N43 + N63 ))\n3\n3\nC6 := V (N63 + N73 \u2212 (N10\n+ N11\n))\n\nSo m1 (E 3 ) is contained in the intersection of all the varieties defined by these equations. As done\nbefore one can compute the Jacobian of these relations and analyze it at the singular points (for\n3\nexample at the point p := (0 : . . . : 0 : 1 : \u22121 : \u22121 : 1) which is image of the curve C3,3\n). We get 7\nindependent relations among the 12 variables Ni , for example choosing Q4 , Q6 , Q10 , Q13 , C1 , C2 and\nC3 . Hence dim(kerJp ) = 12 \u2212 7 = 5 and kerJp =< (a : b : \u2212a : \u2212b : c : d : \u2212c : \u2212d : e : \u2212e : \u2212e : e) >,\na, b, c, d, e \u2208 C. Once we projectivize this yields Tp (Q4 , Q6 , Q10 , Q13 , C1 , C2 , C3 ) \u2243 P4(a:b:c:d:e) . In the\naffine coordinate chart N11 = 1 the tangent vectors are given by (a, b, c, d). Considering the quadric\nQ2 we obtain that ab \u2212 cd = 0. Thus the points we obtain by contracting one of the 27 curves are\nordinary double points.\nWe already said that the map m1 is not defined in the 27 points pi,j,k i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, and hence we\nf3 , of E 3 in the base locus of m1 .

We study what\nhappens locally when we approach the point pi,j,k . We consider\n\u0001 the parametrized line through p =\np(0), p(t) = (\u2212\u03b6 i + tu1 , tv1 ), (\u2212\u03b6 j + tu2 , tv2 ), (\u2212\u03b6 k + tu3 , tv3 ) , where ((u1 , v1 ), (u2 , v2 ), (u3 , v3 )) \u2208\n(C2 )3 and t \u2208 C.

The coordinates on Tp (Ex \u00d7 Ex \u00d7 Ex ) are v1 , v2 , v3 , since u1 = u2 = u3 = 0,\nf3 over p is mapped to a P2 = P(Tp E 3 ) = P2\nand thus the exceptional divisor of E\n(v1 :v2 :v3 ) linearly\n11\n11\nf\n3\nembedded in P . It remains to prove that the differential of the map m1 : E \u2192 P is injective on\n\nthe exceptional divisors. To do this let us choose as complex coordinates\nof E 3 on Ex \u00d7 Ex \u00d7 Ex the\np\n3\n3\n3\ncoordinates zi . So E is locally isomorphic to C(z1 ,z2 ,z3 ) and zi = \u22121 \u2212 yi3 . Blowing up C3(z1 ,z2 ,z3 )\nin (0, 0, 0) we obtain a variety locally isomorphic to C(z1 ,b,c) , where z2 = bz1 and z3 = cz1 . The action\nof \u03c6\nf3 on the coordinates (z1 , b, c) is (z1 , b, c) 7\u2192 (\u03b6z1 , b, c). Hence the quotient C3(z1 ,b,c) /\u03c63 is locally\nisomorphic to a copy of C3 with coordinates (z13 , b, c). Computing the Jacobian of the map induced\nby m1 on this quotient, one finds that the rank of the Jacobian is 3 (i.e is maximal), hence the map\nf3 has an injective differential (except on the contracted curves).\ninduced by m1 on E\nRemark 3.5. As in the case of m0 , one proves that F \u2212 M is big and nef. Indeed m1 contracts the\ncurves Aki,j and (F \u2212 M )Aki,j = 0. All the non contracted curves have positive intersection with F \u2212 M\n(cf. Remark 3.4). Hence for each curve C in Z, (F \u2212 M )C \u2265 0, so F \u2212 M is nef. Since (F \u2212 M )3 > 0,\nit is also big. In particular hi (F \u2212 M ) = 0, i > 0.\n\nWe observe that using the intersection form on P ic(Z) one immediately finds that the image of the\ndivisor Bi,j,k under m1 is a linear subspace (we computed explicitly this result on the blow up), indeed\n(F \u2212 M )2 Bi,jk = 1.\n3.3.

We summarize the\nproperties of this map in the following proposition, which is proved in this section. Let us denote by\nSj1 (resp. Sj2 , Sj3 ) the surface pj \u00d7 E \u00d7 E (resp.

Moreover one immediately sees that\nthe surfaces with zi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, are contracted to points by the map m2 . Under the condition\nzi 6= 0, for each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, m2 is 3 : 1. As in Sections 3.1, 3.2 one can prove that the Jacobian Jm2\nrestricted to E 3 is injective away from the contracted surfaces Sji .\nIn [K] a dominant rational map of degree three between E 3 and the threefold V3,3 is given. Comparing\nthe map described in [K] with m2 one observes that they coincide, up to a choice of the signs of the\ncoordinate functions of P5 . In [K], Kimura observes that the existence of this map is predicted by the\nTate conjecture. The variety V3,3 has 9 singularities of type (3, 3, 3, 3) at the points (1 : \u2212\u03b6 a : 0 : 0 :\n0 : 0), (0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : \u2212\u03b6 b ) and (0 : 0 : 1 : \u2212\u03b6 c : 0 : 0) (a, b, c = 0, 1, 2), which can be resolved by a\nsimultaneous blow up. By a direct computation one shows that the tangent cone over the singularity\nis a Del Pezzo cubic in P3 and more precisely the Fermat cubic in P3 . We also observe that there are\n27 curves (\u2212s : \u03b6 a s : \u2212t : \u03b6 b t : 0 : 0), (0 : 0 : \u2212t : \u03b6 b t : \u2212u : \u03b6 c u), (\u2212s : \u03b6 a s : 0 : 0 : \u2212u : \u03b6 c u) and 27\nsurfaces (\u2212s : \u03b6 a s : \u2212t : \u03b6 b t : \u2212u : \u03b6 c u), a, b, c = 1, 2, 3, on V3,3 which contain the singular points and\nwhich do not appear in the image m2 (E 3 ). We will show that these curves and surfaces are contained\nf\nf3 .\nin the image of E\n\nIt suffices to consider the problem locally: locally E 3 is isomorphic to a copy of C3(z1 ,z2 ,z3 ) . Blowing\nup the origin one obtains the variety V (bz1 \u2212 az2 ) \u2229 V (cz1 \u2212 az3 ) \u2229 V (cz2 \u2212 bz3 ) \u2282 C3(z1 ,z2 ,z3 ) \u00d7 P2(a:b:c) ,\nwhich is isomorphic to a copy of C3 with coordinates (z1 , b, c), in the affine set a = 1. Applying the\nmap m2 to these new coordinates ((x1 , y1 , z1 ); (x2 , y2 , bz1 ); (x3 , y3 , cz1 )) one obtains (x1 bc : y1 bc : x3 b :\ny3 b : x2 c : y2 c). It is clear that, in the affine set a = 1, the map is not defined on the curve b = c = 0\nand that the exceptional divisor P2(a:b:c) over the point pi,j,k identified by xh = 1, h = 1, 2, 3, y1 = \u2212\u03b6 i ,\ny2 = \u2212\u03b6 j , y3 = \u03b6 k is sent to (\u2212bc : \u03b6 i bc : \u2212ab : \u03b6 j ab : \u2212ac : \u03b6 j ac) \u2243 P2(ab:ac:bc) . The map restricted to\nthe exceptional divisor P2(a:b:c) is (a : b : c) \u2192 (bc : ac : ab), so it is a Cremona transformation.\nBlowing up C3(z1 ,b,c) along the curve b = c = 0 one finds, as an open subset, a third copy of C3 with\ncoordinates (z1 , b, \u03b3), related to the previous ones by c = \u03b3b.

In [WvG] it is proved that this Calabi\u2013Yau is isomorphic to a 35 : 1 cover of P3 branched\nalong the configuration of six planes which was constructed in [Hi]. The map associated to this cover\nis \u03c2 : (X0 : X1 : X2 : X3 : X4 : X5 ) \u2192 (X03 \u2212 X13 : X23 \u2212 X33 : X43 \u2212 X53 : X23 + X33 ), hence there exists\na 36 : 1 rational dominant map between E 3 and P3 , obtained by the composition\n\u03c2 \u25e6 m3 , defined by\n\u0001\n(z2 z3 )3 (\u2212x31 + y13 ) : (z1 z2 )3 (x33 \u2212 y33 ) : (z1 z3 )3 (\u2212x32 + y23 ) : (z1 z2 )3 (x33 + y33 ) .\nAnother construction of the same Calabi\u2013Yau is given in [M] where it is shown that the 35 : 1 map\nV3,3 99K P3 is the composition of a 34 : 1 map V3,3 99K T and a 3 : 1 map T \u2192 P3 , the last map being\na 3 : 1 cover of P3 branched along the six planes which are the faces of a cube.\n3.4. Other maps. In the previous section we analyzed the maps defined on Z associated to the\ndivisors F , F \u2212 M and F \u2212 2M . These divisors give 3 : 1 or 1 : 1 maps, but they do not give an\nimage which is isomorphic to Z. Indeed, the divisors F and F \u2212 M are big and nef, but not ample\nand F \u2212 2M is not nef. In particular none of them is very ample. Here we want to prove that the\n\n\f18\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\ndivisor 2F \u2212 M is a very ample divisor and hence f2F \u2212M (Z) is isomorphic to Z, where f2F \u2212M is the\nmap defined by the divisor 2F \u2212 M . In general it is not easy to find criteria which assure that a given\ndivisor is very ample, and indeed we will prefer to consider explicitly the map associated to 2F \u2212 M\nand prove that it is an isomorphism on the image. However it is clear that since F and F \u2212 M are\nboth nef and big, the sum of these divisors 2F \u2212 M is nef and big.\nLet m : E 3 \u2192 PN be the composition of the map f2(3\u03a6) defined on E 3 and the projection on the\neigenspace of the eigenvalue \u03b6 (with respect to the action of \u03c63 ). By Remark 3.3 we know that the\nmap induced by m on Z is the map f2F \u2212M .\nProposition 3.5. The base locus of the map m consists of the 27 points pi,j,k . It induces an evf3 , whose differential is injective. The map induced on Z is an\nerywhere defined 3 : 1 map over E\nisomorphism on the image and is associated to the divisor 2F \u2212 M which is very ample.\nProof. By Remark 3.3 we have\n\nm : E3\n\n\u2212\u2192 P74 = P(N2,1 ),\n\nand we are considering monomials contained in the eigenspace relative to \u03b6.\nWe consider only the monomials with one z, namely of the form\nvi vj vk with vi \u2208 {zi xi , zi xi }, vj \u2208 {x2j , xj yj , yj2 } and vk \u2208 {x2k , xk yk , yk2 },\nwhere {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}. We restrict ourselves to the open subset defined by xh = 1 for h = 1, 2, 3.\nThe rank of the Jacobian of m is 3. Thus the differential is injective where the map is defined.\nWe recall that F \u2212 M defines an isomorphism on Z except on the curves Aij,k , which are contracted, so\n2F \u2212M is an isomorphism outside the curves Aij,k and thus it suffices to prove that 2F \u2212M = F +F \u2212M\nhas an injective differential on these curves. The blow up of E 3 in the points pi,j,k is locally the blow\nup of C3(z1 ,z2 ,z3 ) in the origin and is isomorphic to C3(z1 ,b,c) on an open subset (cf. subsection 3.3).\nThe quotient by the map \u03c6\nf3 is locally isomorphic to C3(z3 ,b,c) . Applying the map induced by m to\n1\nC3(z3 ,b,c) and computing the differential one obtains that it has rank 3 everywhere, in particular where\n1\nb = c = 0 (which is the curve corresponding to A1j,k ). So the map m induces on Z a map which is an\nisomorphism everywhere, thus divisor 2F \u2212 M is very ample.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.7. The divisor F \u2212 M + F1 is a nef and big divisor on Z. It is easy to check that it\ncontracts the curves A2j,k and A3j,k (indeed it acts essentially as F \u2212 M on these curves), but is an\nisomorphism on A1j,k (indeed it acts on these curves as 2F \u2212 M ) and away from the curves Aij,k\n(again because F \u2212 M has the same property). One can also check that (F \u2212 M + F1 )2 A1j,k = 1 and\n(F \u2212 M + F1 )2 Aij,k = 0 if i = 2, 3. Analogously we have that F \u2212 M + Fi , i = 1, 2, 3, contracts 18\ncurves among Ahj,k and is an isomorphism away from the contracted curves.\nSimilarly the map associated to the divisor F \u2212 M + Fi + Fj , i 6= j, i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, contracts 9 curves\namong Ahk,l and is an isomorphism away from these curves.\n4. Other Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds\nUntil now we considered the well known Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z. The aim of this section is to recall\nthat, starting from the Abelian 3-fold E 3 or from the Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold Z, one can construct other\nCalabi\u2013Yau 3-folds with different Hodge numbers and properties. We will describe some already\nknown constructions and results. In Section 5 we present two Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds obtained from a\nsingular model of Z by a smoothing. One of these was unknown until now.\n4.1. Quotient by automorphisms. To construct Z we considered the desingularization of the quotient of the Abelian variety E 3 by the automorphism \u03c63 . Similarly we can consider quotients of E 3\nby other automorphisms, or quotients of Z by automorphisms induced by the ones of E 3 .\n\n\fA RIGID CALABI\u2013YAU 3-FOLD\n\n19\n\nExample 4.1. We already saw an example of this construction in 3.1. Indeed the group G \u2243 (Z3 )2 =\nh\u03c63 , \u03c6i = h\u03b6 \u00d7\u03b6 \u00d7\u03b6, \u03b6 \u00d7\u03b6 2 \u00d71i acts on E 3 and E 3 /G is a singular 3-fold which admits a desingularization\nY which is a Calabi\u2013Yau. This 3-fold is already known ([CH], [GvG], [R]) and its Hodge numbers are\ncomputed in [R]: h2,1 = 0, h1,1 = 84. The automorphisms \u03c63 and \u03c6 commute on E 3 , this implies that\n\u03c6 induces an automorphism \u03b1 of order 3 on E 3 /\u03c63 and also on Z. Thus the 3-fold Y can be obtained\nalso as desingularization of the quotient Z by the automorphism \u03b1. The automorphism \u03b1 preserves\nthe 3-holomorphic form on Z, and this guarantees that the quotient Z/\u03b1 has a desingularization\nwhich is a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold.\nAs in the previous example, one can construct automorphisms on Z considering the automorphisms\nof E 3 , which commute with \u03c63 . These automorphisms induce automorphisms on Z.\nOn each Abelian variety A, and in particular on E 3 , the translations by points are defined, indeed\nfor each point r \u2208 A the map tr : A \u2192 A such that tr (q) = q + r for each q \u2208 A is an automorphism\nof A. Let us assume that the order of tr is finite. The quotient E 3 /tr does not have the Hodge\nnumbers of a Calabi\u2013Yau variety, indeed translations preserve all the holomorphic forms on E 3 , thus\nh1,0 (E 3 /tr ) = h2,0 (E 3 /tr ) = 3. However the translation tr commutes with the automorphism \u03c63\nif and only if \u03c63 (r) = r. In this case the translation tr defines an automorphism on E 3 /\u03c63 and a\ndesingularization of E 3 /h\u03c63 , tr i has the Hodge numbers of a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold.\nThe Abelian variety E 3 admits a larger group of automorphisms: GL3 (Z[\u03b6]) \u2282 Aut(E 3 ). In particular,\nthe automorphism \u03c63 \u2208 GL3 (Z[\u03b6]) is the diagonal matrix (\u03b6, \u03b6, \u03b6). Since all the matrices M \u2208\nGL3 (Z[\u03b6]) commute with the diagonal matrix (and in particular with \u03c63 ), the automorphisms of E 3\ngiven by the matrices M induce automorphisms on Z. Thus GL3 (Z[\u03b6]) \u2282 Aut(Z). If \u03c3 \u2208 SL3 (Z[\u03b6])\nis of finite order, then Z/\u03c3 has a desingularization which is a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold. It is in general an\nopen (and non trivial) problem to find explicitly such a desingularization and to compute its Hodge\nnumbers h1,1 , h2,1 .\nIn [OS] some quotients of E 3 by subgroups of SL3 (Z[\u03b6]) and their crepant resolutions are analyzed\n([OS, Theorem 3.4]). We notice that the definition of Calabi\u2013Yau variety in [OS] is slightly different\nfrom our definition, indeed in [OS] it is not required that h2,0 = 0 and some particular singularities\nare admitted. Anyway, the 3-folds X3,1 and X3,2 in [OS, Theorem 3.4] have h2,0 = 0.\nIn [Do] the finite subgroups of SL3 (Z) are classified and the action of some of these subgroups on the\nproduct of three elliptic curves is studied.\nIn [AW] certain Calabi\u2013Yau varieties obtained as desingularization of quotients of an Abelian variety\nby a group of automorphisms are presented and their cohomology is computed.\n4.2. Elementary modifications. In [Fr] two constructions are considered, both of them are related\nto the presence of rational curves C on a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold X such that the normal bundle of C in X\nis NC/X \u2243 OP1 (\u22121)\u2295 OP1 (\u22121). The curves which satisfy this property are said to be of type (\u22121, \u22121).\nThe first construction is the elementary modification with respect to one of these curves, the second\none is the smoothing of the threefold obtained by contracting these curves. We will see later that the\ncurves Ahi,j on Z are rational curves of type (\u22121, \u22121) and hence can be used for these constructions.\nThe elementary modification on a rational curve C \u2282 X of type (\u22121, \u22121) consists of a blow up of C\nand a blow down: blowing up the curve C on X, one obtains a variety X\u0302 with an exceptional divisor\nD which is isomorphic to P1 \u00d7 P1 (which is a P1 -bundle over the curve C \u2243 P1 ). Now one can contract\nthe first or the second copy of P1 in the exceptional divisor P1 \u00d7 P1 . One of these contractions is the\nopposite of the blow up X\u0302 \u2192 X, gives exactly X and sends D to C \u2282 X, the other one gives a new\n3-fold X \u2032 (in this case D is sent to a rational curve C \u2032 \u2282 X \u2032 ), which is said to be obtained by X by\nan elementary modification (or a flop) on the curve C:\nX\nC\n\n\u2190 X\u0302\n\u2190 D\n\n\u2192 X\u2032\n.\n\u2192 C\u2032\n\nIf X is projective, X \u2032 is not necessarily a projective variety, (see for example [Fr, Examples 7.6, 7.7]).\nIn fact X \u2032 may not even be K\u00e4hler.\nIn [O] some fibrations on the 3-fold Z are described. They are induced by the projection of E 3 on\n\n\f20\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nE \u00d7 E, the product of two factors of E 3 , and the general fiber is an elliptic curve. Thanks to the\nresults in section 1.3 we conclude that these elliptic fibrations are associated to the divisors Fi + Fj\non Z. These elliptic fibrations have some singular fibers which are the fibers over the points of E \u00d7 E\n(the base of the fibration) which are fixed by \u03c63 . These fibers consist of a rational curve and 3 planes.\nFrom this geometric description it is immediate that the rational curve is one of the curves Ahi,j and\nthe planes are three of the Bi,j,k 's. More precisely, if the fibration considered is obtained from the\nprojection E 3 \u2192 E \u00d7 E on the second and the third factors, then the rational curves over the points\n(pi , pj ) \u2208 E \u00d7 E are A1i,j and the planes in the fibers are Ba,i,j , a = 1, 2, 3. Once one fixes the\nprojection E 3 \u2192 E \u00d7 E the rational curves in the exceptional fibers depend only on i, j and these\ncurves are denoted by li,j in [O]. In [O, Proposition 2.2] it is proved that the curves Aki,j (denoted\nby li,j by Oguiso) are of type (\u22121, \u22121). Moreover in [O, Proposition 2.4] the 3-folds XT , obtained by\nelementary modifications on certain subsets T of curves Aki,j , are proved to be Calabi\u2013Yau varieties\nwith h2,1 = 0. By construction, the 3-folds Z and XT are birational, but in [LO, Theorem 3.1] it is\nproved that they are not homeomorphic, i.e they are not equivalent from a topological point of view,\nbut they are birationally equivalent.\n5. The smoothings\nIn this Section we construct a new Calabi\u2013Yau threefold obtained by smoothing a singular model of\nZ.\nIn [Fr, Section 8] the smoothing of a singular variety obtained by the contraction of certain curves on\na 3-fold with trivial canonical bundle is analyzed. Let V be a 3-fold with trivial canonical bundle and\nlet Ci be rational curves on it. Let V be the 3-fold obtained contracting the Ci and let us assume that\nthe Ci contract to singular ordinary double points, pi , on V . Let r : V \u2192 V be the contraction. Let\nVt be the 3-fold obtained by smoothing V , i.e Vt is the fiber over t of a proper flat map f : V \u2192 \u2206,\nwhere \u2206 is the unit disc of C, such that f \u22121 (0) = V and f \u22121 (s) = Vs is smooth for each s \u2208 \u2206, s 6= 0.\nFriedman proves the following results:\nLemma 5.1. [Fr, Lemma 8.7] Let V be a compact complex 3-fold with only ordinary double point\nsingularities and let \u03c0 : V \u2192 V be a small resolution such that the canonical bundle of V is trivial.\nLet pi be the singularities of V and Ci be the curve \u03c0 \u22121 (pi ). Then there exists a first order deformation\nthem to first order) if and only if the fundamental\nof V which is non trivial for the pi (i.e smooths\nP\nclasses [Ci ] in H 2 (V, \u03a92V ) satisfy a relation i \u03bbi [Ci ] = 0 such that for every i, \u03bbi 6= 0.\n\nThis Lemma gives a condition to assure that there exists a smoothing of the 3-fold V . The following\ntwo lemmas describe the properties of this smoothing, if it exists.\nLemma 5.2. ([Fr, Lemma 8.1])With the previous notations, let e : \u2295i ZCi \u2192 H2 (V, Z) be the map\nwhich associates to each curve its class, then H2 (Vt , Z) is isomorphic to the cokernel of e and b3 (Vt ) =\nb3 (V ) + 2s, where s is the rank of the kernel of e.\nLemma 5.3. ([Fr, Lemma 8.2])With the previous notations: 1) if hi,0 (V ) = 0 for a certain i, then\nhi,0 (Vt ) = 0 for any small t.\n2) If the canonical bundle of V is trivial and h1,0 (V ) = 0, then the canonical bundle of Vt is trivial.\nThe previous lemma implies that, if V is a Calabi\u2013Yau variety, then Vt is a Calabi\u2013Yau variety.\nMoreover if one can describe the map e, its kernel and its cokernel, one immediately deduces b2 (Vt )\nand b3 (Vt ). For a Calabi\u2013Yau variety we have b2 = h1,1 and b3 = 2 + h2,1 + h1,2 = 2 + 2h2,1 . Thus\nknowing e, one determines the Hodge diamond of the Calabi\u2013Yau variety Vt .\nNow the idea is to apply these results to V = Z and to the contraction m1 of the 27 curves Aki,j ,\ni, j, k = 1, 2, 3. Indeed Z := m1 (Z) is a 3-fold with only ordinary double points (this was proved in\nProposition 3.3, but is also the consequence of the cited result by Oguiso, [O, Proposition 2.2], who\nproved that the curves Aki,j are of type (\u22121, \u22121)) and m1 : Z \u2192 Z is the small resolution required by\n\n\fA RIGID CALABI\u2013YAU 3-FOLD\n\n21\n\nLemma 5.1. Now it suffices to show that there exists a relation in H2 (Z, Z) \u2243 H 4 (Z, Z)\nX\n(21)\n\u03bbi,j,k Aki,j = 0, \u03bbi,j,k 6= 0, for each i, j, k = 1, 2, 3,\ni,j,k=1,2,3\n\nto prove that there exists a smoothing of Z. If this smoothing exists, then its fibers are Calabi\u2013Yau\n3-folds, by Lemma 5.3. We described Aki,j as linear combination of a basis of H 2,2 (Z) in (10). Hence\nit suffices to substitute each Aki,j with its expression in (21) and to determine \u03bbi,j,k such that all the\ncoefficients of the basis of H 2,2 (Z) are equal to zero. The following choice for the \u03bbi,j,k , all non zero,\ngives the relation:\n4A11,1 +\n\n3\nX\n\nA11,i +A12,1 \u22122\n\n3\nX\n\nA12,i +A13,1 \u22122\n\ni=1\n\ni=2\n\ni=2\n\n3\nX\n\nA13,i \u22122\n\n3\nX\n\nA21,i +\n\n3\nX\n\nA22,i +\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n3\nX\n\nA23,i \u22122\n\n3\nX\n\nA31,i +\n\ni=1\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nA32,i +\n\n3\nX\n\nA33,i = 0.\n\ni=1\n\nHence there exists a smoothing of Z and its fibers are Calabi\u2013Yau varieties. We compute the Hodge\nnumbers of these Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds, using Lemma 5.2. Indeed the map e in this lemma is exactly the\none described by the relations (10). It is a trivial computation to show that its kernel has dimension\n6 and hence we have that b3 (Vt ) = 2 + 12 = 14 and b2 (Vt ) = 36 \u2212 21 = 15. Thus the Hodge diamond\nof the Calabi\u2013Yau varieties which are smooth fibers of the smoothing of Z has the following Hodge\ndiamond:\n1\n0\n0\n(22)\n0\n15\n0\n1\n6\n6\n1\nand Euler characteristic equal to 18.\nRemark 5.1. In [BCD, Figure 1] the known Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds with small Hodge numbers are\nlisted. The Calabi\u2013Yau threefold obtained as smoothing of Z with Hodge diamond (22) is unknown.\nIn a similar way one can consider the map fF \u2212M+F3 associated to the divisor F \u2212 M + F3 . As proved\nin Section 3.4, this map contracts the 18 curves Aki,j , i, j = 1, 2, 3, k = 1, 2 and is injective with\nan injective differential away from these curves. The map fF \u2212M+F3 : Z \u2192 fF \u2212M+F3 (Z) contracts\nthe curves Aki,j , i, j = 1, 2, 3, k = 1, 2 to ordinary double points (indeed all these curves are of type\n(\u22121, \u22121)). Among these curves there exists the following relation:\n2\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nA11,i \u2212\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\n3\n3\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\nA22,i + A23,1 = 0\nA21,i +\nA12,i + A13,1 \u2212 2\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nthus one can smooth fF \u2212M+F3 (Z) to Calabi\u2013Yau varieties. By Lemma 5.2 we compute the Hodge\nnumbers of such a smooth Calabi\u2013Yau: b3 = 2 + 4 = 6, b2 = 36 \u2212 16 = 20. Thus the Hodge diamond\nis\n1\n0\n0\n(23)\n0\n20\n0\n1\n2\n2\n1\nand Euler characteristic equal to 36.\nThe situation is essentially the same considering the maps induced by F \u2212 M + F1 and F \u2212 M + F2 .\nRemark 5.2. In [CD, Pag. 25, line 1 and Section 3.4.2] a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with the Hodge\ndiamond mirror of the one in (23) is given. In particular this Calabi\u2013Yau is constructed as smooth\nquotient of a complete intersection. We do not know if this Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is the mirror of the\none constructed as smoothing of fF \u2212M+F3 (Z) or if they only have specular Hodge numbers.\nIn Section 3.4 we noticed that the map associated to F \u2212 M + F1 + F2 contracts the nine curves A3i,j ,\ni, j = 1, 2, 3, but we cannot use the map fF \u2212M+F1 +F2 to construct a smoothing of fF \u2212M+F1 +F2 (Z).\nIndeed it is immediate to check that the curves A3i,j , i, j = 1, 2, 3, are linearly independent and hence\n\n\f22\n\nSARA ANGELA FILIPPINI AND ALICE GARBAGNATI\n\nthere exists no relation among them as required by Lemma 5.1, i.e there exists no smoothing of\nfF \u2212M+F1 +F2 (Z).\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we analyzed the geometry of the rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefold Z. This Calabi\u2013Yau is well\nknown, but the careful description of its geometry allows us to give a different interpretation of known\nresults (for example of the generalized mirror) and to construct other Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds.\nThe mirror conjecture says that two families of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds are mirror if the complex moduli\nspace of one of them is locally isomorphic to the K\u00e4hler moduli space of the other one. The definition\nof the isomorphism among these two moduli spaces implies that the instanton corrections defined\non H 1,1 of one of them can be reconstructed by the superpotential of the complex moduli defined\non H 2,1 of the other Calabi\u2013Yau threefold and thus involve the Yukawa coupling on the Calabi\u2013Yau\nthreefolds. The mirror conjecture is stated, and in particular cases proved, under two hypotheses\non the families of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds: the families have to be at least 1\u2013dimensional and have to\nadmit a point with maximal unipotent monodromy. Families of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds without a point\nwith maximal unipotent monodromy are described for example in [R], [GvG],[G]. An extension of the\nmirror conjecture to these families is until now unknown. On the contrary, there are some ideas to\nextend the mirror conjecture to rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds (see [S], [CDGP], [AG]). In particular in\n[CDGP] a generalized mirror for the threefold Z is proposed. In the classical mirror symmetry there\noften is a geometric link among families of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds and their mirrors and this link is\nvery useful in the mirror construction: the most famous example is the mirror of the quintic in P4 ,\nwhich is the desingularization of the quotient of a particular quintic by a group of automorphisms. In\nthis paper we have analyzed a lot of properties of the well known rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefold Z and\nwe gave a geometric relation between it and its generalized mirror.\nThe other problem we analyzed is the construction of famillies of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds with given\nHodge numbers. In [BCD] there is a list of the pairs of small numbers which can be the Hodge numbers of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. Not all these pairs correspond to known Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. Here\nwe constructed a new family with given Hodge numbers, starting from the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold Z.\nIn this paper we have obtained essentially three types of results: in sections 1.1 and 2 we described the\ntrilinear form on P ic(Z) and hence we gave information on the Yukawa coupling of Z; in Section 3 we\ngave very explicit equations of projective models of Z, related one of them with the generalized mirror\nof Z and suggested how to construct other models; in Section 5 we constructed other Calabi\u2013Yau\nthreefolds starting from Z.\nIn Section 1 the trilinear form on P ic(Z) is computed. As we already said this gives information on\nthe Yukawa coupling of Z, but it is also important in view of the construction of the projective models\nof Z. The computation of this form is very explicit and we essentially proved that the Picard group\nof Z splits in two parts, one of them comes from P ic(E 3 ), the other one from the resolution of the\nsingularities of the quotient E 3 /\u03c63 . The trilinear form on the second part is very elementary, the one\non the first part depends only on the properties of the Abelian variety E 3 . We proved that the trilinear\nform on P ic(E 3 ) can be expressed in terms of determinants of certain matrices in M at3,3 (Q[\u03b6]). This\nis useful because, of course, makes the computation easier, but could also have a deeper meaning,\nindeed this creates a strong relation between a significative part of the Yukawa coupling of Z and a\ngroup of matrices. This could help in clarifying the relation between string theory and exceptional\nsupergravities, cf. [FFS].\nThe threefold Z is well known in the literature as desingularization of the quotient of an Abelian\nvariety by a group of automorphisms, but there are not many explicit descriptions of its projective\nmodels. Here we provided three very explicit descriptions and suggested a strategy to obtain many\nothers: We wrote down the equations of maps from E 3 to projective spaces and related them with\n\n\fA RIGID CALABI\u2013YAU 3-FOLD\n\n23\n\ndivisors on E 3 . Thanks to the strong relation between Z and E 3 these maps give (singular) models\nof Z. In particular, we analyzed three maps: The first one exhibits Z as a 3 : 1 cover of another\nCalabi\u2013Yau threefold Y, which is contained in the cubic hypersurface F8 in P8 . This is interesting in\nview of the study of the mirror conjecture of rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds, indeed in [CDGP] a quotient\nof the cubic Fermat hypersurface F8 is proved to be a generalized mirror of Z and the hypersurface F8\nis conjectured to be the generalized mirror of Y (see [KLS]). Here we have provided a geometric relation between these two rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds (Z, Y) and their generalized mirrors. The second\nmap gave a singular birational model of Z. It is embedded in P11 and its singular locus consists of\n27 ordinary double points. This model is used in Section 5 to construct other Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds.\nThe third map was already considered by Kimura in [K] and exhibits the birationality of Z and the\nvariety V3,3 , a complete intersection of two particular cubics in P5 .\nThe richness of the results obtained from the study of these three maps (such as the geometric relation between rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds and their generalized mirrors or the possibility to construct\nother Calabi\u2013Yau varieties) suggests it might be interesting to analyze also other models, constructed\nin a similar way (i.e writing the explicit maps defined on E 3 ). For this reason we introduced maps\nassociated to other divisors (see Remark 3.3 and Section 3.4) and in particular we proved that one\nof these divisors is very ample (and thus gives an isomorphism between Z and its image under the\ninduced map).\nWe think that our results on the connection between P ic(Z) and a group of matrices and on the\ngeometric relation between Z and its generalized mirror could lead to a deeper understanding of the\ngeneralization of the mirror conjecture to rigid Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds.\nThe construction of several projective models is important to better understand the geometry of Z,\nbut also because from singular models of Z we have constructed new Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. In\nsections 4 and 5 we presented some constructions which can be used to obtain Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds\nfrom a given one, in particular from Z. One of these constructions is the smoothing of a singular\nmodel of Z. Considering singular models constructed in Section 3 and applying the smoothing to\nthese models we obtained two distinct Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds with different Hodge numbers. One\nof these Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds was unknown until now. It is now clear that the analysis of other\nsingular projective models of Z (for example associated to the divisors proposed in Section 3) could\ngive other unknown Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds. As we said, one can obtain other models considering the\nmaps presented in Section 3.4, but one can also apply the techniques of Section 3 to other varieties\nwhich are desingularizations of quotients of known varieties. This should give a lot of Calabi\u2013Yau\nthreefolds and we hope to find new Calabi\u2013Yau varieties in this way.\nAcknowledgements. The authors are grateful to Bert van Geemen for the idea which underlies this\nwork and for stimulating discussions. We would also like to thank Sergio Cacciatori for several advices\nand detailed comments on the paper.\nReferences\n[AG]\n\nP. S. Aspinwall, B. R.
