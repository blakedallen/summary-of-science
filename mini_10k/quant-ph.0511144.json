M. Nieuwenhuizen\nInstitute for Theoretical Physics, Valckenierstraat 65, 1018 XE Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nAbstract. Quantum mechanics is considered to arise from an underlying classical structure (\"hidden variable theory\", \"subquantum mechanics\"), where quantum fluctuations follow from a physical noise mechanism. The stability of the hydrogen\nground state can then arise from a balance between Lorentz damping and energy absorption from the noise. Since the damping\nis weak, the ground state phase space density should predominantly be a function of the conserved quantities, energy and\nangular momentum.\nA candidate for this phase space density is constructed for ground state of the relativistic hydrogen problem of a spinless\nparticle. The first excited states and their spherical harmonics are also considered in this framework.\nThe analytic expression of the ground state energy can be reproduced, provided averages of certain products are replaced\nby products of averages. This analysis puts forward that quantum mechanics may arise from an underlying classical level as a\nslow variable theory, where each new quantum operator relates to a new, well separated time interval.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn this centenary of Einstein's Annus Mirabilis it is appropriate to reconsider the foundations of physical theories.\nWe shall, in particular, be interested in a possible bridge between the three fields that Einstein pushed so much in\n1905: brownian motion, special relativity and quantum mechanics. Our focus is to investigate the possibility that\nquantum mechanics arises as a statistical theory from a certain special relativistic theory, with specific stochastic\nforces constituting the notorious \"quantum noise\". Conceptually this will be a \"unified field theory\", which Einstein\ntried to formulate in the second part of his life. Without fully specifying this theory, we shall generalize squares of\nquantum wavefunctions to phase space densities and see what it leads to.\nIn order to motivate our investigations, let us notice that the status of quantum mechanics is still judged in two\nbasically opposite ways. The empirical view stresses that quantum mechanics, with its many postulates such as the\nsuperposition principle, the uncertainty principle, the exclusion principle, the Born rule, the collapse in measurements,\nis our best theory of nature, proven to work in all cases where it was tested, ranging from solid state physics\nand quantum chemistry to high energy physics and the early Universe. Most physicists even believe that quantum\nmechanics is the ultimate theory of nature, that must be unified with gravity, one popular route being string theory,\nwhich adopts the additional postulates of supersymmetry and extra dimensions.\nOn a parallel track, there has always remained the fundamental question: what is quantum mechanics actually\nstanding for? Does nature have a reality: do particles exist as physical entities, possessing a position and a momentum;\nis the moon there when nobody looks? What is the physical mechanism behind the notorious \"quantum fluctuations\"\nand uncertainty relations? What causes interference effects and the particle-wave duality? Does each particle have its\nown wavefunction (standard Copenhagen interpretation), what does a \"collapse of the wavefuction\" mean physically\n1\n? For decades these questions have suffered from the lack of progress, in particular in the quantum measurement\nproblem, the only undisputed point of contact between quantum mechanics and nature. Very different interpretations\nhave emerged [2]: the Everett-Wheeler relative state or multi-universe picture (collapse does not occur, but rather a\nbranching); the mind-body problem (the registration of the measurement in our mind or a machine matters) (Wigner,\nsee [2]), the wavefunction codes our state of knowledge [3] or our state of belief [4].\n\n1\n\nNothing measurable according to Zbinden et al [1].\n\nClassical Phase Space Density for the Relativistic Hydrogen Atom\n\nOctober 11, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fAt present a variety of different approaches support the possibility that at the quantum level, nature has a 'natural'\n(i.e. more classical than long supposed) behavior. We may mention: arguments against the conclusion that nature\nshould be non-local because of violations of Bell inequalities [5, 6, 7]; the demonstration that quantum probabilities\nincluding interference effects are compatible with classical probability theory [8]; the long effort of Stochastic\nElectrodynamics [9] and its later version called Linear Stochastic Electrodynamics [9, 10]; the demonstration of\nentanglement in classical brownian motion [11]; the description of an electron with its spin as a soliton (over-extremal\nKerr-Newman black hole) in electro-gravity [12, 13]; the many arguments in favor of the statistical interpretation\n[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]; explicit solutions for the quantum measurement problem [18, 19].\nLet us go in some detail about the measurement process. By taking into account an explicit model for the apparatus,\nthe quantum measurement problem was recently solved in our group in two situations: in the first the position of a\nboson is measured by an apparatus that consists of many bosons. The apparatus starts close to an (ideal) Bose-Einstein\nphase transition and is driven into it by the measurement [18]. In the second model the z-component of a spin- 21 is\nmeasured by an apparatus consisting of many spins- 12 [19] that start out as a paramagnet and are driven into the up\nor down ferromagnetic phase, according to the sign of the measured spin component. In both cases the apparatus also\nconsists of a heat bath, which originates from other degrees of freedom, in the magnetic case the lattice vibrations.\nQuantum mechanics being a probabilistic theory, it should come as no surprise that what could be calculated was the\nstatistical distribution of outcomes for an ensemble of measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared systems or\nidentical preparations of a single system. Technically this comes in because the whole exercise is to determine the postmeasurement density matrix given its pre-measurement form. The process goes in two steps: when coupling the system\nto the apparatus, there appears a very fast collapse of the off-diagonal terms (the death of Schr\u00f6dinger cats). This\n\"collapse of the wavepacket\" is a unitary evolution in the large Hilbert space of system and pointer degrees of freedom\nof the apparatus (thus not involving the bath), very similar to the process of dephasing in NMR physics. The collapse\ntime depends as an inverse power on the number of particles in the apparatus, so it is strongly microscopic when\nthe apparatus is macroscopic. On a later stage the effect of the bath is to make this collapse definite by decoherence.\nSchr\u00f6dinger cat terms thus disappear automatically, because of the macroscopic size of the apparatus. The second\nstep of the measurement is its registration, which involves the diagonal elements of the density matrix and appears\nto have classical features [20]. Indeed, for the magnetic model, the solution of this part of the problem is just what\none might have anticipated from purely classical thermodynamic reasoning [20]. In particular, a bath is needed simply\nbecause energy has to be dumped when the macroscopic pointer variable (the magnetization of the apparatus) goes\nfrom its initial metastable paramagnetic value to its up or down ferromagnetic value. Also in cloud chambers, the\nenergy released upon creating bubbles in an oversaturate liquid has to be transfered to the environment and this very\nmechanism allows the selection of circumstances where these bubbles have a desired average size.\nFrom the recent solutions of two realistic models for the quantum measurement process, it became clear that the\nstatistical interpretation of quantum mechanics allows a simple interpretation of this process during and after the\nmeasurement. To mention one problem that is immediately solved in this way: the fundamental question how quantum\nmechanics can describe collapse of the measured operator has the answer: quantum mechanics describes only the\nstatistics of those collapses; it is not the proper theory to describe an individual collapse. Spontaneous collapse models\n(GRWP theories), that try to treat individual collapses from a slightly extended quantum mechanics, attempt to heal a\nproblem that has its roots at a more fundamental level. Indeed, for a two slit experiment quantum mechanics does not\ndescribe any individual spot on the photographic plate, but only the density of many spots.\nThus, we conclude that Quantum mechanics is not a theory of nature itself, but a theory for the statistics of outcomes\nof experiments. This situation is very similar to the one of thermodynamics, where the underlying level of, say a\nLennard-Jones gas, is Newton's equations of motion. The main difference is, however, that experiments have to be\nmade with apparati which themselves are always macroscopic and therefore influence the microscopic dynamics.\nSince it is the task of physicists to describe nature, the search for a sub-quantum theory (hidden-variables theory) is,\nin our eyes, completely justified. The program to search this may contain the following steps\n1) For point particles, show compatibility between classical phase space density structures and quantum structures.\n2) Find the underlying stochastic theory and isolate the stochastic forces which cause the \"quantum fluctuations\".\nShow compatibility with quantum mechanics.\n3) Find soliton-like solutions for elementary particles such as the electron. An interesting attempt sees an electron\nas a Kerr-Newmann black hole, that is, as a charged ring with diameter given by the Compton wavelength [12, 13].\nOn the ring a current runs with the speed of light, causing a spin, with g = 2, as in the Dirac theory for the electron. In\nthese theories the parameters must be fixed to the physical values by adding terms to the Einstein-Maxwell theory. A\npossibility is to couple torsion with the electromagnetic field tensor [21], which might fix charge and/or spin, though\nClassical Phase Space Density for the Relativistic Hydrogen Atom\n\nOctober 11, 2018\n\n2\n\n\fnot yet the mass. Within this framework the Pauli principle might arise as an energetic constraint on the behavior in\nthe far field region, and Einstein photons as massless spin-one solitons. Let us notice that indistinguishably is a natural\naspect of solitons that wind up in a chaotic motion.\n4) Show that the consistency still works for the \"stochastic soliton mechanics\" of solitons in the random electromagnetic background, with \"photons\" appearing as classical EM waves and as \"Einstein\" solitons.\nClearly, the program may run into contradictions at many points: apart from internal consistency, compatibility with\na huge amount of experiments is required. But if Einstein was right after all, then there should be some road to the\nunderlying structure, and this one seems to us the simplest, so it deserves to be investigated further.\nIn this work we shall restrict ourselves to point 1) of the program and observe that already this one is more\ncomplicated than sketched here.\n\nMOTIVATION FROM STOCHASTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS\nQuantum mechanics has both a particle and wave nature. In a subquantum approach, it is clear how to think of\nthe particles, to start they are just considered as points, so the next question: what are the waves made of. In the\nsimplest approach, one assumes that the waves are due to fields that we know already. The first candidate then is\nElectromagnetism. One has then arrived at the so-called Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED), where the zero-point\nfluctuations known as a slogan in quantum mechanics are attributed to a physical entity, namely classical random EM\nfields [9]. To get the proper connection, one then has to choose the energy content of each mode as 12 h\u0304\u03c9 , in which the\nprefactor h\u0304 is just a system parameter, chosen to coincide with Planck's constant. The related spectral density is just\nthe zero point part of the Planck spectrum, \u03c1 (\u03c9 ) = h\u0304\u03c9 3 /(2\u03c0 2c3 ). This \u03c9 3 -dependence is precisely the one consistent\nwith Lorentz invariance and with thermodynamics.\nThe theory of SED has a long history of both success and failures. SED has explained the harmonic oscillator and,\nwith it, electric dipole harmonic oscillators, the Casimir and Casimir/Polder effects, and the Unruh effect.\nAway from harmonic systems, SED has a long record of failures. First, a connection with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nhas never been found. Second, the role for excited states has been discussed only in the margin. It should be admitted\nthat, whereas Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics at first neglects the decay of excited states, the structure of SED is that of timedependent perturbation theory, where the full time-dependence is taken into account from the start. Third, a long list\nof non-linear problems has been studied, where results different from quantum mechanics emerge, see e.g. [22].\nThe most obvious example will be the subject of this study: the ground state of the hydrogen problem. This is a\nrather clean problem that should be understood before conclusions are drawn about validity or invalidity and about\nmulti-level atoms. Indeed, in the hydrogen problem no internal structure should be expected that complicates the\norbiting of the point-electron in the central force field of the infinitely heavy nucleus. Theoretical results so far are\nmeager, predicting stability radius of the orbit equal to infinity [9]. Surprisingly, a numerical analysis by Zhou and\nCole supports an SED explanation of the quantum ground state density [23].\nThat the hydrogen problem should have a stable solution within SED, was put forward long ago: when the electron is\nfar from the nucleus, its orbital frequency is low and so should be the relevant frequencies of the stochastic force. Due\nto the \u03c9 3 spectrum, there should essentially be no random force at all. What remains is the Lorentz damping that brings\nthe electron closer to the nucleus. For small distances, on the other hand, the relevant frequencies should be large, and\nthe spectrum predicts a strong kicking due to the random forces, preventing electron to fall into the nucleus due to\nLorentz damping alone. There thus appears a stable atomic state. Is this the one we know from quantum mechanics?\nSo far attempts to show this have failed, including those by ourselves [21].

They lead to the Lamb shift, which is of order \u03b1 5 Z 4 ln \u03b1 Z in the present units. So it is\nweaker than the fine structure, represented by the \u03b1 4 Z 4 term in (1.13). The very same mechanism makes the lifetimes\nof excited states much larger than the Bohr time.\nTo focus our line of reasoning, let us consider the theory of stochastic electrodynamics (SED). Here random\nelectromagnetic fields are assumed to exist. In this theory a Fokker-Planck approach may be formulated for the\nstatistics of the random orbits (r(t), p(t)) [9, 21]. The phase space density will satisfy an equation of the form\nP(r, p,t) = h\u03b4 (r(t) \u2212 r)\u03b4 (p(t) \u2212 p)i\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u2202t P = \u2212L P + Lorentz damping + diffusion terms\n\n(2.2)\n\nwill satisfy\n\nwith drift given by the Liouvillian\n1\nr\nL \u2261 p * \u2207r \u2212 3 * \u2207p\n\u03b3\nr\n\n(2.3)\n\nSince damping and diffusion terms are of order \u03b1 3 , the stationary distribution should, to this order, be a function of the\nconserved quantities, angular momentum L and energy E. This remains valid if one goes beyond the Fokker-Planck\nequation and for other stochastic theories. So the weakness of the Lamb shift finally allows us to consider equilibrium\nstructures of a class of stochastic theories, without going to specific details.\nThe ground state should follow from the dynamical problem H \u2261 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 2 Z 2 /r = E or, equivalently,\nE2 \u2212 1\n1 2 \u03b1 2Z2 E\n\u2212\np \u2212\n=\n2\n2r2\nr\n2\u03b1 2 Z 2\n\n(2.4)\n\nThere will also be effects of damping and noise, but they enter here only at order \u03b1 3 , and should explain the Lamb\nshift. We shall neglect those effects in the present paper.

It is seen that the difference is mainly at small p, where because of the phase space\nvolume little weight is located. The tails are already small when they start to deviate from each other.\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this paper we have considered the question whether the quantum probability densities (the squares of quantum\nwavefunctions) of the relativistic hydrogen atom, in the absence of electron spin, may arise from the phase space\ndistribution in an underlying classical stochastic theory (\"sub-quantum theory\" or \"hidden variable theory\"). Because\nof the small value of the fine structure constant, this is a weak damping problem, for which it is generally known\nthat the stationary distribution is determined by conserved quantities (energy and angular momentum) alone. Without\nClassical Phase Space Density for the Relativistic Hydrogen Atom\n\nOctober 11, 2018\n\n10\n\n\f0.8\n\nW\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nP\n0.2\np\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIGURE 5.1. Reduced phase space density P(p) of the non-relativistic hydrogen ground state, Eq. (5.4), (lower curve), and\nreduced Wigner density W (p), Eq. (5.2), (upper curve), as function of the momentum p, in atomic units. They are both normalized\nto unity.\n\nspecifying the underlying stochastic theory, we have shown by construction that such a scheme can work for the\nconsidered cases. The relativistic version of the hydrogen problem has been chosen in order to have the fine structure\nconstant as a parameter, and the generalization works to all orders (be it that from the outset, all Lamb shift effects are\nneglected, in our approach as well as in Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics).\nOur resulting phase space density P(r, p) does not coincide with the Wigner function W (r, p). For the hydrogen\nground state the latter can be expressed as derivatives of an integral [24, 25]. In contrast, for our ground state P(r, p)\nis explicit, it contains powers and an exponential. Although we did not prove its uniquness, it looks simple and has been\ngeneralized for the whole family of Yrast states. It is well known that the Wigner function for the hydrogen ground\nstate is partly negative, and this has long been considered as a no-go argument against any classical-type subquantum\nstructure. However, our P(r, p) is non-negative for the ground state. Does this solve that paradox? Yes, because our\nmomentum stands for the instantaneous momentum of the particle. The momentum of the Wigner function is defined\nin via off-diagonal elements of the quantum density matrix, and should be considered as a coarse grained momentum,\njust as would happen in brownian motion [26, 11]. For such a coarse grained momentum positivity of the density is\nnot obvious, probably not needed, and certainly absent.\nFrom a physical point of view, there are many reasons to accept that particles are to good approximation point\nparticles: traces in cloud chambers, images of non-flat crystal surfaces obtained by scanning tunnel microscopy,\ntrapping of ions in magnetic fields over periods exceeding a year. If, one the subquantum level they just have a position\nand a speed, the phase space density cannot be negative. The problem of negative probabilities is solved for our ground\nstate, but still a potential danger for excited states. For the 2p state the generalized spherical harmonics are partly\nnegative, while for the 2s state the radial phase space density is partly negative. But in the theory of classical brownian\nmotion the excited states are also partly negative, while the total probability density will always be non-negative.\nWithin Stochastic Electrodynamics the 2s state can be populated by a two-photon excitation from an ensemble of\nground state atoms, but it cannot happen in such a manner that the total phase space probability is negative anywhere.\nFor instance, one could imagine a large population of the 1s state and a partial one of the 2s state, with not-too-large\nvalues of L and R in the 2s state, such that the total probability is still positive everywhere. Afterall, at the classical level\neach realization consists of an electron in some orbit around the nucleus in the presence of fluctuations, and a \"state\"\nmerely describes an ensemble of such systems. The 2p phase space densities at m fixed are partly negative, so they\n1\u22121\ncannot exist on their own. However, the 'transversally' polarized mixture P21 (E, L)(Y1\u22121\n+ Y1111 ) is non-negative,\n1\u22121\nwhile the unpolarized mixture P21 (E, L)(Y1\u22121\n+ Y1010 + Y1111 ) = 3P21 (E, L)/(4\u03c0 ) is strictly positive. They can in\nprinciple exist without ground state buffer. The odd parts may differ from the assumed linear ones of (4.4). When they\n1\u22121\nare cubic, both Y1\u22121\nand Y1111 can be positive, but not Y1010 . The quantum operator Lz op may then be identified with\nthe classical L\u0302z times a constant.\nGiven the phase space distribution, we have considered the average energy. We have observed that the quantum\nenergy eigenvalues are reproduced provided certain correlations are neglected, after which averages of products reduce\nto products of averages. Physically this occurs when these averages are taken at very different times, such that their\nfluctuations are uncorrelated. This hints at the possibility that the operator structure of quantum theory arises from the\nphysics of timescale separated observables in an underlying stochastic theory. The property that repeatedly applying a\nquantum operator on one of its eigenstates produces just powers of the related eigenvalue has a natural interpretation\nClassical Phase Space Density for the Relativistic Hydrogen Atom\n\nOctober 11, 2018\n\n11\n\n\fin terms of temporal separation of averages, as is long understood in the theory Stochastic Electrodynamics [9]. It is\nremarkable that such a separation appears necessary here to establish the proper mapping of energies between the class\nof stochastic theories and quantum mechanics.\nIn atomic physics spectral emissions are due to transition from an excited state to a lower one. The 2p-state has\na lifetime given by \u03b1 \u22123 \u03c40 multiplied by phase space factors, the final result is of order of magnitude of the inverse\nLamb shift frequency \u223c 1 ns. So about \u03b1 \u22123 Keppler orbits are traversed before the emission takes place. This large\nnumber of revolutions, together with the gradual influence of the noise that slowly changes the orbits, may explain the\nsharpness of spectral lines within our picture. If only a few orbits are traversed, the sharpness of the spectral line will\nnot be achieved, since the spread in energies of Keppler orbits is large. But this just provides a physical picture for the\nenergy-time uncertainty relation know from quantum mechanics.\nThere are many remaining and often worrying issues. An essential item is the role of dynamics, such as the 1s-2s\nand 1s-2p interference terms. Likewise, there is the task to include spin. It is good to realize that our present radial\ndistributions are functions of L2 , which remains conserved in the presence of spin.\nFor scattering and ionization experiments on of e.g. electrons on e.g. atomic hydrogen [27] it is known that the\nenergy loss of the incoming electron can only take one of the discrete values needed to bring the ground state electron\nto the one of the excited levels (Lyman lines). In the recent work [28] transitions to n = 2, 3 and 4 are clearly observed,\nwhile the higher states form a quasi continuum, that matches the ionization continuum. Whether these discrete features\ncan be described in the present formalism is a question related to the existence of excited states, and the timescale on\nwhich they express themselves. What we have discussed is a number of features that should be respected in our class of\nthe underlying theories. Whether the proposed type of ground state and excited states exists and what happens during\nelectron scattering events, are questions that cannot be answered before specializing the precise type of stochastic\nnoise.\nLike any new theory, the present approach poses more questions than it solves. For any sub-quantum theory a vast\namount of experimental constraints is to be respected. But we are convinced that no individual quantum experiment\nis described by any current theory. So if Einstein was right after all, quantum mechanics is incomplete and then there\nshould be some path to an underlying, more complete theory. We hope that the present work plays a role in uncovering\nit.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank Armen Allahverdyan for discussions that throughout the years helped to shape this research\nand Roger Balian for several more.
