It provides a generalization to real metals of Lifshitz theory\nof molecular interactions between dielectric solids. The theory is used to compute the radiative heat\ntransfer between two parallel metal surfaces at different temperatures. It is shown that a measurement of this quantity may provide an experimental resolution of a long-standing controversy about\nthe effect of thermal corrections on the Casimir force between real metal plates.\nPACS numbers: 12.20.Ds, 42.50.Lc\nKeywords: Fluctuations, surface impedance, Casimir, superconductors.\n\nOne of the most intriguing predictions of Quantum\nElectrodynamics is the existence of irreducible fluctuations of the electromagnetic (e.m.) field in the vacuum.\nIt was Casimir's fundamental discovery [1] to realize that\nthe effects of this purely quantum phenomenon were not\nconfined to the atomic scale, as in the Lamb shift, but\nwould rather manifest themselves also at the macroscopic\nscale, in the form of a force of attraction between two parallel discharged metal plates at distance L. By modern\nexperimental techniques the Casimir force has now been\nmeasured with an accuracy of a few percent (see Refs.[2]\nand Refs. therein). For a recent review on both theoretical and experimental aspects of the Casimir effect,\nsee Ref.[3]. A few years after Casimir's seminal paper,\nE.M. Lifshitz developed the general theory of molecular\nattractive forces between dielectric bodies [4] based on\nRytov's theory of e.m. fluctuations [5]. In this theory,\nthe physical origin of the attraction resides in the fluctuating e.m. field which is always present in the interior of\nany absorbing medium, and extends beyond its boundaries partly in the form of propagating waves and partly\nas evanescent waves. The resulting expression of the attractive force automatically includes both non-retarded\nand retarded effects, as well as the effect of the bodies\ntemperature . Moreover, for zero temperature and in the\nlimit \u01eb(\u03c9) = \u221e, it reproduces the force found by Casimir\nfor two perfect mirrors.\nThe basic assumption in Lifshitz theory is that one\ncan describe the propagation of e.m. fields inside the materials by means of a dielectric constant. As it is well\nknown [6, 7], this is not always the case for metals, because when the penetration depth \u03b4 of the e.m. field becomes comparable or larger than the free mean path of\n\n\u2217 Bimonte@na.infn.it%;\n\nthe conduction electrons, there are non-local correlations\nin the material, and it is no longer possible to use the\nsimple form of the wavevector derived from a dielectric\nresponse (anomalous skin-effect). It is well known, however that in a wide range of frequencies, including the\nanomalous region, the fields outside a metal can be accurately described by means of the surface impedance \u03b6(\u03c9)\nintroduced by M. A. Leontovich [7]. We recall that the\nsurface impedance \u03b6 relates the tangential components\nEt and Bt of the e.m. fields on the surface of the metal.\nFor isotropic surfaces:\nEt = \u03b6(\u03c9) [Bt \u00d7 n] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n in the inward unit normal to the surface. For an\nideal metal \u03b6 = 0, while for a good conductor |\u03b6| \u226a 1.\nThe purpose of this Letter is to develop the theory of\ne.m. fluctuations for metal surfaces. The main result is\na new formula for the correlation functions of the random e.m. fields that are present outside a metal surface\nin thermal equilibrium, as a result of the fluctuating microscopic currents in the interior of the metal. A key\nfeature is that the correlation functions are expressed in\nterms of the surface impedance, and therefore they apply\nto the anomalous region, as well as to superconductors\n(extreme anomalous effect).\nLet the metal occupy the z < 0 half-space. We consider\nthe Fourier decomposition of the e.m. field outside the\nmetal. For the electric field of TE modes, we write:\nZ \u221e\nZ\n1\n~\n~ (T E) =\nE\nd\u03c9\nd2 k\u22a5 a(\u03c9, ~k\u22a5 ) ~e\u22a5 ei(k*~x\u2212\u03c9t) +c.c. ,\n(2\u03c0)3/2 0\n(2)\nwhere ~k\u22a5 is the tangential component of the wave-vector\n~k and ~e\u22a5 is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane\nformed by ~k\u22a5 and the normal to the metalp\nsurface. The\n2\nthird component of the wave-vector kz = \u03c9 2 /c2 \u2212 k\u22a5\nis defined such that Re(kz ) \u2265 0 and Im(kz ) \u2265 0. In\n\n\f2\nthis way the external field appears as a superposition of\nOur new formulae for the correlation functions of the\npropagating waves (p.w.) travelling away from the surfluctuating e.m. field are expressed in terms of the statisface (for k\u22a5 < \u03c9/c) and of evanescent waves (e.w.) (for\ntical averages of the products of the amplitudes a(\u03c9, ~k\u22a5 )\nk\u22a5 > \u03c9/c) exponentially dying out away from the surand b(\u03c9, ~k\u22a5 ):\nface.

We obtained the above\nformulae by considering p.w. with frequencies \u03c9 belonging to the domain of the normal skin effect, for which\ndielectric and surface impedance b.c. give coinciding results provided only that \u01eb\u2032\u2032 \u226b 1, with \u01eb\u2032\u2032 thepimaginary\npart of \u01eb. In this region [7] one can take \u03b6 = \u03bc/\u01eb, with\n\u03bc the magnetic permeability (we took \u03bc = 1) and then,\nfor p.w. in this domain, Eqs.(4-6) coincide to high accuracy with the analogous expressions derived from Lifshitz\ntheory. We stress however that the validity of Eqs. (4-6)\nextends to the anomalous region, where Lifshitz theory\nis inapplicable, and therefore they constitute a new nontrivial generalization of that theory. Details will be given\nelsewhere.\nAs a first application of Eqs.(4-6), we have obtained a\nnew derivation of the Casimir force between two metallic\nplates. Existing derivations based on surface impedance\nb.c., as found in the literature (see for example Ref.[8]),\nuse a mode analysis to evaluate the Casimir free energy\nof the cavity, much in the spirit of the original Casimir's\npaper. The delicate thing in this approach is to justify\nthe validity of the result in the case of dissipative mirrors, which requires consideration of an auxiliary electrodynamic problem (see the second of Ref. [8] for details).\nUsing Eqs. (4-6), we can however obtain the Casimir\nforce in much the same way used by Lifshitz, i.e. by\ncomputing the statistical average of the z-component of\nthe Maxwell stress tensor inside the gap, resulting from\nfluctuating e.m. fields, at a point close to the surface\nof either plate. Dissipation poses no problem now, and\nis taken into account from the start. The computation\nis rather lengthy and gives the following result for the\nspectral density F\u03c9 of the attraction force F per unit\n\narea (F =\nF\u03c9 = coth\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n(6)\n\nd\u03c9 F\u03c9 ):\n\nh\u0304\u03c9\n2kT\n\n\u0013\n\nh\u0304\u03c9 3\nRe\n2\u03c0 2 c3\n\nZ\n\np2 dp\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n[(C\u03b1 \u22121)\u22121 +1/2] ,\n(7)\n\nwhere\nC\u03b1 = e\u22122ip \u03c9 L/c /(r\u03b1(1) r\u03b1(2) ) , \u03b1 = T E, T M.\n\n(8)\n\nHere p = c kz /\u03c9 and the integration with respect to p is\nalong the real axis from 1 to 0 (corresponding to p.w.)\nand thence along the imaginary axis to i\u221e (correspond(1)\n(2)\ning to e.w.), while r\u03b1 and r\u03b1 are the impedance reflection coefficients for mirror 1 and 2 respectively:\n(i)\n\nrT M =\n\nc kz /\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b6i\n,\nc kz /\u03c9 + \u03b6i\n\n(i)\n\nrT E =\n\n\u03b6i c kz /\u03c9 \u2212 1\n.\n\u03b6i c kz /\u03c9 + 1\n\n(9)\n\nEqs. (7) and (8) are of the same form as those obtained\nby Lifshitz, apart from the expression of the reflection\ncoefficients. After disregarding in Eq.(7) the terms with\n1/2, which give a divergent L-independent contribution,\nand after a rotation of the integration contours of \u03c9 and\np, our expression for F becomes identical to that in [8].\nThe second application of Eqs.(4-6) that we consider\nis new and much more interesting, as it relates to the\npresently controversial issue of the modification of the\nCasimir force arising from a non zero temperature of the\nmirrors, when the latter are treated as real metals. The\ndebate was raised by the findings of Refs. [9], showing\nthat the combined effect of temperature and finite conductivity leads to large deviations from the ideal metal\ncase.

[9] have been\ncriticized by several authors, and supported by others.\nThere is no space here to discuss the matter, and we address the reader to Refs. [8] and [10] for a discussion of\nthe extended literature on this topic.\nOf particular interest to us is the criticism of Ref.[9]\nin the second of Refs.[8], where it is argued that the\ndielectric model, in combination with the Drude dielectric function, fails to describe the thermal Casimir force\neven in the domain of the normal skin effect, and that\nalso in this region the appropriate description is provided by impedance b.c.. Further arguments in favor of\nthis point of view were found in [11], where the spectrum of finite temperature corrections to the Casimir\nforce is studied, for metallic plates of finite conductivity. This study shows that the large deviations from the\nideal metal case in [9] arise from thermal TE e.w. of low\nfrequencies (\u03c9 = 1010 \u2212 1013 rad/s for L = 1\u03bcm), for\nwhich the description of the plates as bulk dielectrics is\n\nS=\u2212\n\n4h\u0304\n\u03c0 2 c2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 3\n0\n\n\u0012\n\nnot valid. It is also shown there that if surface impedance\n\u221a\nb.c. are used, with \u03b6 = 1/ \u01ebD (which is the expression\nvalid in the domain of the normal skin effect), instead\nof the large repulsive thermal correction from TE e.w.\nfound in [9], one obtains an attractive correction, of much\nsmaller magnitude, while no appreciable differences are\nfound both in the TM and in the TE p.w. sectors [16].\nThe conclusion of this study is that the conflicting statements on thermal corrections to the Casimir force, may\nbe traced back to different magnitudes for the thermal\nTE e.w. correction, in the two approaches.\nIn view of these findings, it would be important to devise new experiments to probe the effectiveness of the\ntwo approaches to describe physical effects of thermal\nTE e.w., in the frequency range that is relevant for the\nCasimir effect. Optical data are of no help here, since\nthey refer to p.w., and therefore give no information on\ne.w.. A key remark now is that the relevant e.w. are\nnot vacuum fluctuations, as in the Casimir force at zero\ntemperature, but rather real thermal excitations. Now,\nit is known that thermal e.w. play an important role in\nthe heat transfer S between two closely spaced metal surfaces, at temperatures T1 and T2 [13]. It is therefore very\ninteresting to see what is the prediction of impedance\ntheory for S, and to compare it with the result from Lifshitz theory. The computation of S goes through the\nsame steps as in Lifshitz' computation of the Casimir\nforce [13]. One assumes that each plate separately is in\nlocal thermal equilibrium, and emits a fluctuating e.m.\nfield according to our Eqs. (4-6), with T the temperature of the emitting plate. Since thermal e.m. fields\nfrom plates 1 and 2 are uncorrelated, the radiated power\nS can be obtained by subtracting incoherently the average Poynting vectors for the multiply reflected radiation\nfields originating from either plate. Apart from the fact\nthat we obviously evaluate the average Poynting vector\ninstead of the Maxwell stress-tensor, the only difference\nwith respect to the computation of thermal corrections\nto the Casimir force is that the fluctuating fields from\nplate 1 and 2 are relative now to distinct temperatures\nT1 and T2 . Apart from this, these thermal fields have the\nsame expression as in the Casimir force computation, at\nnonzero temperature. Our final formula for the power S\n(per unit area) has the form of a difference between two\nterms, one for each plate:\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\nexp(h\u0304\u03c9/kT1 ) \u2212 1 exp(h\u0304\u03c9/kT2) \u2212 1\n\nwhere the contour of integration for p is the same as in\n\n\u0013\n\nRe(\u03b61 )Re(\u03b62 ) Re\n\nZ\n\ndp p |p|2 |e2ipL\u03c9/c |\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nBT E\n\n+\n\n1\n\n\u0013\n\nBT M\n(11)\n\nEq.(7), and the quantities BT E/T M are defined as:\nBT E = |(1+p\u03b61 )(1+p\u03b62 )\u2212(1\u2212p\u03b61 )(1\u2212p\u03b62 ) exp(2ipL\u03c9/c)|2 ,\n(12)\n\n\f4\n-9\n\n8*10\n\n-9\n\n6*10\n\n-9\n\n4*10\n\n-9\n\n2*10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n(imp)\n\n14\n(Lif)\n\nFIG. 2:\nPlot of the difference sT E e.w.

In\nparallel with the analysis of thermal corrections to the\nCasimir force described earlier, the figure compares the\nresult from Lifshitz theory, Eq. (19) of Ref. [13], with\nthe Drude dielectric functionp\nEq. (10) (dashed line), with\nour Eq. (11), with \u03b6(\u03c9) = 1/ \u01ebD (\u03c9) (solid line). In both\ncases, we took h\u0304 \u03a9p = 11.5 eV and h\u0304\u03b3 = .05 eV. We see\nthat impedance theory and Lifshitz theory give rather\ndifferent predictions for S (for L = 0.3 \u03bcm, impedance\ntheory gives for S a value approximately 17 % larger\nthan Lifshitz theory ). We observe that in the considered\nsubmicron separation range, heat transfer occurs mainly\nvia TE e.w.. The smaller contribution from p.w. and\nfrom TM e.w. is practically the same for the two theories, to an accuracy of a few parts in ten thousand, and\ntherefore the difference between the two curves in Fig. 1\narises exclusively from TE e.w.. For larger separations\nthe relative weight of e.w. with respect to p.w. decreases,\nand the two theories lead to very similar results. Already at one micron the results from Lifshitz theory and\nimpedance theory differ only by four percent. We eval-\n\n[1] H.B.G. Casimir, Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet. Rev. 51, 793\n(1948).\n[2] S.K.

We see that two spectra differ significantly\nprecisely in the low-frequency region which, according to\n[11] is at the origin of the controversial thermal corrections to the Casimir force. As pointed out in Ref.[11],\nin this frequency domain the penetration depth is of the\nsame order as the mean free path of the conduction electrons. Therefore the dielectric model for the plates is\nnot valid, and a more relistic description is provided by\nsurface impedance b.c.. It is clear that an accurate measurement of S would provide strong indications of which\napproach is preferable, a knowledge which could then\nbe used in the evaluation of the thermal Casimir effect.\nAn experiment measuring the radiative heat transfer between two chromium plates is described in Ref. [14]. Even\nthough the author of Ref. [14] claims to have obtained\nsome evidence for proximity effects related to e.w., his\nmeasurements were performed mostly for plates separations larger than one micron, where we expect small differences between the two theories. Moreover, as the author does not quote the area of the plates, no comparison\nis possible with his data. It would therefore be desirable\nto repeat the measurements for submicron separations,\nand for metals that are used in Casimir experiments.\nIn conclusion, we have presented new formulae for the\ncorrelation functions of e.m. fluctuations present outside\na metal. The formulae involve the surface impedance of\nthe metal, and are therefore applicable in the anomalous\nregion, as well as in the extreme anomalous case (superconductors), where Lifshitz theory is not valid. As an\napplication, we have evaluated the radiative heat transfer between two metal plates at different temperatures\nand we have shown that a measurement of this quantity should provide enough information to settle experimentally recent controversies about the thermal Casimir\neffect. We plan to apply our results to superconducting cavities, that were proposed recently [15] as a tool\nto measure the variation of Casimir energy across the\nsuperconducting phase transition.\nThe author thanks G.L.
