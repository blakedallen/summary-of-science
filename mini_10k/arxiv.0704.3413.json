It provides a quantum model (interacting) where the\nkappa symmetry is gauge fixed and a BRST is provided. Using the BRST operators one\ncan compute the cohomology and the spectrum. Unfortunately, the interacting worldvolume\naction does not allow a simple analysis of the complete spectrum and only the massless sector\ncan be studied by using the target space symmetries. Nevertheless, the main advantage is\na complete superspace description of the theory in terms of vielbeins, gravitinos and the\nsuperfield generalization of the 3-form of 11-dimensional supergravity [2, 3]. Recently in [4],\nwe have shown that there is a deep relation between the pure spinor BRST symmetry [5, 6]\nand the Free Differential Algebra of 11 supergravity and we have used these facts to obtain\na complete algebraic derivation of the BRST symmetry and of the symmetries of the model.\nThe resulting action has a manifest supersymmetry and it depends on the supergravity\nbackground superfields. Those superfields are obtained from the FDA by gauge completing\nthe superfield starting from a given bosonic background which satisfies the equations of\nmotion. (We have to remind the reader that the FDA's for 11-dimensional supergravity\ndiscussed in sec. 2 imply the equations of motion).\nHowever, to solve the FDA for a given background is not a trivial task and the complete\nsuperfield is needed in order to compute amplitudes in presence of a given background. In\npractice one needs a superfield only up to a certain power in the fermionic coordinates.\nThe reason is that the coefficients of higher powers are simply ordinary derivatives of the\nlowest components and they do no carry new information. Nevertheless, those coefficients\nenter the computation of amplitudes and we need a method to reconstruct a complete superfield in terms of the bosonic solution. There are on the market several techniques, see\nfor example [7, 8, 9, 10] just to quote some of them adapted to our problem. These techniques start from a very general setting and they provide an iterative reconstruction method,\nwhich unfortunately hides completely the geometry behind the solution. We take a different perspective: we start from a solution with some supersymmetries (in our case, from\nthe 4-dimensional point of view we take the supersymmetric models with N = 8, 3, 1) and\nsome relevant isometries and we try to build a complete superfield solution respecting these\nsymmetries. The rheonomic parametrizations of FDA.s are integrable by construction and\nthe consistency conditions are just the equations of motion [3]. Therefore we need to start\nfrom an on-shell background solution and we are guaranteed that the solution exists. The\nbest way to find complete solutions of the FDA is terms of a super-Lie algebra and of\nits Maurer-Cartan forms. As will be discussed in next sections, one starts from the Killing\nspinor of the bosonic solution and he reconstructs the gravitino fields by \"pairing\" the Killing\nspinors of the bosonic submanifold with fermionic Maurer-Cartan forms of the underlying\nalgebra. Then, by inserting the gravitino field in the FDA and using the relations between\nthe Maurer-Cartan forms dictated by the Lie superalgebra, one finds that the gravitinos\nsatisfy their own equations. In the same way one can modfify the bosonic supervielbein\nby adding the bosonic Maurer-Cartan forms and, by inserting it into the FDA equations,\none finds all correct pieces. This technique permits a direct complete solution of the gauge\ncompletion only for supergroups or supercosets. It does not work that simply in the case of\nless supersymmetry of the background, and some modifications are needed.\n2\n\n\fFirst, one needs to study the obstruction that prevents one from getting a complete solution as a supergroup or a supercoset. This is parameterized by the Weyl tensor which\nis obtained by commuting two covariant derivatives. Second, one finds that some of the\nstructures of the supercoset technique can still be used. For example, one can organize\nthe fermionic coordinates in two sectors: 1) those related to the linear realization of supersymmetry (the unbroken supersymmetries) and 2) the remaining set related to the broken\nsupersymmetries, and the most convenient method seems to follow very closely the supercoset solution. We assume that the fermionic coordinates are organized according to a pure\nfermionic supercoset and we construct the gravitinos by pairing the Killing spinors and some\nother spinor (needed to span a complete basis of sections of the spinor bundle over the\nbosonic submanifold) with the Maurer-Cartan forms. The violation of the FDA can be compensated by adding to the gravitions and to other superfield additional pieces. These pieces\ncan be taken automatically into account, by promoting the Maurer-Cartan forms to gauged\nMaurer-Cartan forms. This yields an additional term in the vielbein equation which can\nbe reabsorbed into a redefintion of the spin connection. In this way the procedure can be\niterated (even if it will not be pursued here further) and one lands with a complete superfield\nconstruction.\nFortunately, there is an interesting alternative to the iterative solution. This procedure\nhas been developed in [11, 12] and used in several applications (see for example [13]) and\nit is based on the supersolvable realization of the supercoset Osp(8|4)/SO(1, 3) \u00d7 Sp(4, R)\nin the case of M-theory and of SU(2, 2|4)/SO(1, 4) \u00d7 SO(5) for the superstring. Using the\n\u03ba-symmetry one can gauge some coordinates of the superspace to zero and write the MaurerCartan equations only in terms of the reduced superspace. This has the advantage to fix the\ngauge symmetry and to simplify the Maurer-Cartan forms drastically. Specifically it turns\nout that after this gauge fixing, they are just quadratic in the \u03b8-coordinates. In this way,\nthe problem of resumming the complete dependence of the fermionic coordinates is avoided\nand the gauged Maurer-Cartan equations already suffice to solve the problem of the gauge\ncompletion. Indeed, only a remaining additional piece of contorsion must be added in order\nto compensate the non-vanishing of the Weyl tensor.\nThis for what concerns the models with \u03ba-symmetry where the gauge completion can be\nprovided. However, we notice that the same simplification can be achieved by imposing a\nconstraint on the fermionic coordinates. In the case of Osp(8|4)/SO(1, 3) \u00d7 Sp(4, R) is\n\u0398xA \u000fxy \u0398yB = 0 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere the indices A, B run over 1, . . . , 8 and the indices x, y over 1, . . . , 4. The equation\nis symmetric in the SO(8) indices, it is homogeneous of degree two in the scaling of \u0398's,\nis quadratic and it is Sp(4, R) covariant which means that it does not spoil the isometries\nof the AdS4 manifold. It will be shown in the text that these constraints yield the same\nsimplification of the supersolvable realization of the supercoset, and in particular the \u03basymmetry gauge adopted in [11, 12] is a solution of these new constraints. However, in the\ncase of Green-Schwarz type of models these constraints are not consistent with the canonical\nquantization of the model. This is due to fact that in the canonical quantization the \u0398's\nsatisfy a Clifford algebra and the above constraints are not consistent. On the other side,\nusing the pure spinor formalism the commutation relations among \u0398's vanish (they have a\n3\n\n\fnon-vanishing commutation relations with the conjugate momenta, see for example [4]) and\nthe constraints are consistent. In addition, they have the same dignity of the pure spinor\nconstraints and they can be treated on the same footing. (We also mention that quadratic\nconstraints for the supercoordinates appeared also in [14, 15, 16] and in [17]. In [18], which\nis based on pure spinor formulation of BRST symmetry [19, 20], quadratic constraints for\nanticommuting ghosts have been discussed.)\nIn this way, we can use the advantages of the supersolvable description of the background\nin order to derive pure spinor sigma models for supermembrane and superstrings. This can be\nuseful for maximal supersymmetric background and for less than maximal supersymmetric\nspaces.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In sec. 2 and sec. 3, we give some details about\ncompactifications of the bosonic background of the form AdS4 \u00d7G/H, free differential algebras\nand some notations. In sec. 4, we recall the geometry of the spinor bundle and the holonomy\ntensor. In sec. 5 we discuss some property of the supergroup Osp(N |4) and its MaurerCartan forms. Finally, we discuss the gauging and we discuss the solution to the first order.\nThen, we consider two examples in sec. 9. Some additional material is contained in the\nAppendices.\n\n2\n\nThe super FDA of M theory\n\nLet us begin by writing the complete set of curvatures defining the complete FDA of D = 11\nM-theory. As usual this FDA is the semidirect sum of a minimal algebra with a contractible\nalgebra:\n]\nA=M C\n(2.1)\nthe curvatures being the contractible generators C. By setting them to zero we retrieve,\naccording to Sullivan's first theorem, the minimal algebra M. This latter, according to\nSullivan's second theorem, is explained in terms of cohomology of the super Lie subalgebra\nG \u2282 M, spanned by the 1\u2013forms.

This\nlatter implies that the spinor tensor \u03c1ab is\n\u0001\nan irreducible representation 32 , 32 , 12 , 21 , 12 of SO(1, 10), i.e:\n\u0393m \u03c1am = 0\n\n(2.16)\n\nAs we demonstrate later on the most important relations to be extracted from Bianchi\nidentities, besides the rheonomic parametrization, concerns the spinor derivatives of the\ncurvature superfield. This latter is determined from the expansion of the inner components\nof the 4\u2013form field strength Fa1 ...a4 . From the last of eq.s (2.4) we obtain:\nD\u03b1 Fabcd = (\u0393[ab \u03c1cd] )\u03b1 ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere the spinor derivative is normalized according to the definition:\n\u03b1\n\nD Fabcd \u2261 \u03a8 D\u03b1 Fabcd + V m Dm Fabcd\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis shows that the gravitino field strength appears at first order in the \u03b8-expansion of the\ncurvature superfield. Next we consider the spinor derivative of the gravitino field strength\nitself. Using the normalization which streams from the following definition:\nD \u03c1ab = Dc \u03c1ab V c + Kab \u03a8\n\n(2.19)\n\nwe obtain:\nKab = \u2212 41 Rmn ab \u0393mn + D[a Fb] +\n6\n\n1\n2\n\n[Fa , Fb ]\n\n(2.20)\n\n\fThe tensor-matrix Kab is of key importance in the discussion of compactifications. If it\nvanishes on a given background it means that the gravitino field strength can be consistently\nput to zero to all orders in \u03b8.s and on its turn this implies that the 4\u2013field strength can be\nchosen constant to all orders in \u03b8.s This is the case of maximal unbroken supersymmetry. In\nthis case all curvature components of the Free Differential Algebra can be chosen constant\nand we have a superspace whose geometry is purely described by Maurer Cartan forms of\nsome super coset.\nOn the other hand if Kab does not vanish this implies that both \u03c1ab and Fabcd have\nsome non trivial \u03b8-dependence and cannot be chosen constant. In this case the geometry of\nsuperspace is not described by simple Maurer Cartan forms of some supercoset, since the\ncurvatures of the FDA are not pure constants. This is the case of fully or partially broken\nSUSY and it is the case we want to explore. In the the AdS4 \u00d7 (G/H)7 compactifications it\nwill turn out that the matrix Kab is related to the holonomy tensor of the internal manifold\n(G/H)7 .\nLet us finally work out the spinor derivative of the Riemann tensor. Defining:\nD Rab mn = Dp Rab mn V p + \u03a8 \u039bab mn\n\n(2.21)\n\nfrom the first of eq.s (2.4) we obtain:\n\u0001\n| ab\n\u039bab mn = D[m \u2212 F [m \u0398n]\n+ 2 S ab \u03c1mn\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere we have introduced the notation:\n\u0001T\n\u0398n | ab = C \u0398\u0304n | ab = i \u0393c \u03c1ab \u2212 2 i \u0393[a \u03c1b]c\nF a = C (Fa )T C \u22121 =\n\ni\n24\n\n\u0001\n\u0393b1 b2 b3 b4 a \u2212 8 \u03b4a [b1 \u0393b2 b3 b4 ] Fb1 b2 b3 b4\n\n(2.23)\n\nThe matrix Kab and the spinor \u039bab mn are the crucial objects we are supposed to compute in\neach compactification background.\n\n3\n\nCompactifications of M -theory on AdS4 \u00d7 M7 backgrounds\n\nWe are interested in compactified backgrounds where the 11-dimensional bosonic manifold\nis of the form:\nM11 = M4 \u00d7 M7\n(3.1)\nM4 denoting a four-dimensional maximally symmetric manifold whose coordinates we denote\nx\u03bc and M7 a 7\u2013dimensional compact manifold whose parameters we denote y I . Furthermore we assume that in any configuration of the compactified theory the eleven dimensional\nvielbein is split as follows:\n(\nV r = E r (x)\n;\nr = 0, 1, 2, 3\nVa =\n(3.2)\n\u0001\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nV\n= \u03a6 \u03b2 (x) e + W (x) ; \u03b1, \u03b2 = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n7\n\n\fwhere E r (x) is a purely x\u2013dependent 4\u2013dimensional vielbein, W \u03b1 (x) is an x\u2013dependent 1\u2013\nform on x-space describing the Kaluza Klein vectors and the purely x\u2013dependent 7\u00d77 matrix\n\u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 (x) encodes part of the scalar fields of the compactified theory, namely the internal metric\nmoduli. From these assumptions it follows that the bosonic field strength is expanded as\nfollows:\n[4]\n\n[2]\n\nF(Bosonic) \u2261 F [4] (x) + F\u03b1[3] (x) \u2227 V \u03b1 + F\u03b1\u03b2 (x) \u2227 V \u03b1 \u2227 V \u03b2\n[1]\n\n[0]\n\n+ F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 (x) \u2227 V \u03b1 \u2227 V \u03b2 \u2227 V \u03b3 + F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x) \u2227 V \u03b1 \u2227 V \u03b2 \u2227 V \u03b3 \u2227 V \u03b4 (3.3)\n[p]\n\nwhere F\u03b11 ...\u03b14\u2212p (x) are x-space p\u2013forms depending only on x.\nIn bosonic backgrounds with a space\u2013time geometry of the form (3.1), the family of\nconfigurations (3.2) must satisfy the condition that by choosing:\nE r = vielbein of a maximally symmetric 4-dimensional space time\n\u03a6I J (x) = \u03b4 IJ\nWI = 0\n[3]\n\n[2]\n\n[1]\n\nFI (x) = FIJ (x) = FIJK (x) = 0\nF [4] (x) = e \u000frstu E r \u2227 E s \u2227 E t \u2227 E u\n[0]\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (x)\n\n;\n\n(e = constant parameter)\n\n= g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = constant tensor\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n\nwe obtain an exact bona fide solution of the eleven\u2013dimensional field equations of M-theory.\nThere are three possible 4\u2013dimensional maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifolds\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nMinkowsky space\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 M4\nM4 =\n\ndS4\nde Sitter space\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 AdS anti de Sitter space\n4\n\n(3.10)\n\nIn any case Lorentz invariance imposes eqs.(3.5,3.6,3.7) while translation invariance imposes\nthat the vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields \u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 (x) should be a constant matrix\n< \u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 (x) >= A\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(3.11)\n\nWe are interested in 7-manifolds that preserve some residual supersymmetry in D = 4. This\nrelates to the holonomy of M7 which has to be restricted in order to allow for the existence of\nKilling spinors. In the next subsection we summarize those basic results from Kaluza Klein\nliterature that are needed in our successive elaborations.\n\n3.1\n\nM-theory field equations and 7-manifolds of weak G2 holonomy\ni.e. Englert 7-manifolds\n\nIn order to admit at least one Killing spinor or more, the 7-manifold M7 necessarily must\nhave a (weak) holonomy smaller than SO(7): at most G2 . The qualification weak refers\nto the definition of holonomy appropriate to compactifications on AdS4 \u00d7 M7 while the\n8\n\n\fstandard definition of holonomy is appropriate to compactifications on Ricci flat backgrounds\nMink4 \u00d7 M7 . To explain these concepts that were discovered in the eighties in contemporary\nlanguage we have to recall the notion of G-structures. Indeed in the recent literature about\nflux compactifications the key geometrical notion exploited by most authors is precisely that\nof G-structures [25].\nFollowing, for instance, the presentation of [25], if Mn is a differentiable manifold of\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\ndimension n, T Mn \u2192 Mn its tangent bundle and F Mn \u2192 Mn its frame bundle, we\nsay that Mn admits a G-structure when the structural group of F Mn is reduced from\nthe generic GL(n, R) to a proper subgroup G \u2282 GL(n, R). Generically, tensors on Mn\ntransform in representations of the structural group GL(n, R). If a G-structure reduces this\nlatter to G \u2282 GL(n, R), then the decomposition of an irreducible representation of GL(n, R),\npertaining to a certain tensor tp , with respect to the subgroup G may contain singlets. This\nmeans that on such a manifold Mn there may exist a certain tensor tp which is G\u2013invariant,\nand therefore globally defined. As recalled in [25] existence of a Riemannian metric g on Mn\nis equivalent to a reduction of the structural group GL(n, R) to O(n), namely to an O(n)structure. Indeed, one can reduce the frame bundle by introducing orthonormal frames,\nthe vielbein eI , and, written in these frames, the metric is the O(n) invariant tensor \u03b4IJ .\nSimilarly orientability corresponds to an SO(n)-structure and the existence of spinors on\nspin manifolds corresponds to a Spin(n)-structure.\nIn the case of seven dimensions, an orientable Riemannian manifold M7 , whose frame\nbundle has generically an SO(7) structural group admits a G2 -structure if and only if, in the\nbasis provided by the orthonormal frames B \u03b1 , there exists an antisymmetric 3-tensor \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nsatisfying the algebra of the octonionic structure constants:\n\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03ba \u03c6\u03b3\u03b4\u03ba =\n\n1\n18\n\n\u03b3\u03b4\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212\n\n2\n3\n\n\u03c6?\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\n\u2212 61 \u000f\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u03c6?\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u03c6\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhich is invariant, namely it is the same in all local trivializations of the SO(7) frame bundle.\nThis corresponds to the algebraic definition of G2 as that subgroup of SO(7) which acts as an\nautomorphism group of the octonion algebra. Alternatively G2 can be defined as the stability\nsubgroup of the 8-dimensional spinor representation of SO(7). Hence we can equivalently\nstate that a manifold M7 has a G2 -structure if there exists at least an invariant spinor \u03b7,\nwhich is the same in all local trivializations of the Spin(7) spinor bundle.\nIn terms of this invariant spinor the invariant 3\u2013tensor \u03c6\u03c1\u03c3\u03ba has the form:\n\u03c6\u03c1\u03c3\u03ba = 61 \u03b7 T \u03c4 \u03c1\u03c3\u03ba \u03b7\n\n(3.13)\n\nand eq.(3.13) provides the relation between the two definitions of the G2 -structure.\nOn the other hand the manifold has not only a G2 \u2013structure, but also G2 \u2013holonomy if\nthe invariant three\u2013tensor \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03ba is covariantly constant. Namely we must have:\n0 = \u2207\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2261 d\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 + 3 B \u03ba[\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2\u03b3]\u03ba\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere the 1-form B \u03b1\u03b2 is the spin connection of M7 . Alternatively the manifold has G2 \u2013\nholonomy if the invariant spinor \u03b7 is covariantly constant, namely if:\n\u2203 \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(SpinM7 , M7 ) \\ 0 = \u2207 \u03b7 \u2261 d\u03b7 \u2212 41 B \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b7\n9\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fwhere \u03c4 \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, . . . , 7) are the 8 \u00d7 8 gamma matrices of the SO(7) Clifford algebra. The\nrelation between the two definitions (3.14) and (3.15) of G2 -holonomy is the same as for\nthe two definitions of the G2 -structure, namely it is given by eq.(3.13). As a consequence\nof its own definition a Riemannian 7-manifold with G2 holonomy is Ricci flat. Indeed the\nintegrability condition of eq.(3.15) yields:\nR\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b4 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b7 = 0\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b4 is the Riemann tensor of M7 . From eq.(3.16), by means of a few simple\nalgebraic manipulations one obtains two results:\n\u2022 The curvature 2-form\nR\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b4 B \u03b3 \u2227 B \u03b4\n\n(3.17)\n\nis G2 Lie algebra valued, namely it satisfies the condition:\n\u03c6\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 = 0\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhich projects out the 7 of G2 from the 21 of SO(7) and leaves with the adjoint 14.\n\u2022 The internal Ricci tensor is zero:\nR\u03b1\u03ba\u03b2\u03ba = 0\n\n(3.19)\n\nNext we consider the bosonic field equations of M -theory, namely the first and the last of\neq.s ( 2.10 ). We make the compactification ansatz (3.1) where M4 is one of the three\npossibilities mentioned in eq.(3.10) and all of eq.s(3.5-3.9) hold true. Then we split the rigid\nindex range as follows:\n\u001a\n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, . . . = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 = M7 indices\na, b, c, . . . =\n(3.20)\nr, s, t, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3\n= M4 indices\nand by following the conventions employed in [26] and using the results obtained in the same\npaper, we conclude that the compactification ansatz reduces the system of the first and last\nof (2.10) to the following one:\nRrstu\nR\u03b1\u03ba\u03b2\u03ba\nFrstu\ng\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nF \u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03b2\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nD\u03bc F\u03bc\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3 =\n\nrs\n\u03bb \u03b4tu\n3 \u03bd \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1\ne \u000frstu\nf F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\u03bc \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1\n1\n2\n\ne \u000f\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 F \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\n(3.21)\n(3.22)\n(3.23)\n(3.24)\n(3.25)\n(3.26)\n\nEq. (3.22) states that the internal manifold M7 must be an Einstein space. Eq.s (3.23)\nand (3.24) state that there is a flux of the four\u2013form both on 4\u2013dimensional space-time M4\nand on the internal manifold M7 . The parameter e, which fixes the size of the flux on the\nfour\u2013dimensional space and was already introduced in eq.(3.8), is called the Freund-Rubin\n10\n\n\fparameter [27]. As we are going to show, in the case that a non vanishing F \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is required to\nexist, eq.s (3.25) and (3.26), are equivalent to the assertion that the manifold M7 has weak\nG2 holonomy rather than G2 \u2013holonomy, to state it in modern parlance [28]. In paper [29],\nmanifolds admitting such a structure were instead named Englert spaces and the underlying\nnotion of weak G2 holonomy was already introduced there with the different name of de\nSitter SO(7)+ holonomy.\nIndeed eq.(3.26) which, in the language of the early eighties was named Englert equation\n[30] and which is nothing else but the first of equations (2.10), upon substitution of the Freund\nRubin ansatz (3.23) for the external flux, can be recast in the following more revealing form:\nLet\n\u03a6? \u2261 F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 B \u03b1 \u2227 B \u03b2 \u2227 B \u03b3 \u2227 B \u03b4\n(3.27)\nbe a the constant 4\u2013form on M7 defined by our non vanishing flux, and let\n\u03a6 \u2261\n\n1\n\u000f\n24 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4\n\nF\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4 B \u03b1 \u2227 B \u03b2 \u2227 B \u03b3\n\n(3.28)\n\nbe its dual. Englert eq.(3.26) is just the same as writing:\nd\u03a6 = 12 e \u03a6?\nd\u03a6? = 0\n\n(3.29)\n\nWhen the Freund Rubin parameter vanishes e = 0 we recognize in eq.(3.29) the statement\nthat our internal manifold M7 has G2 -holonomy and hence it is Ricci flat. Indeed \u03a6 is\nthe G2 invariant and covariantly constant form defining G2 -structure and G2 -holonomy. On\nthe other hand the case e 6= 0 corresponds to the weak G2 holonomy. Just as we reduced\nthe existence of a closed three-form \u03a6 to the existence of a G2 covariantly constant spinor\nsatisfying eq.(3.15) which allows to set the identification (3.13), in the same way eq.s (3.29)\ncan be solved if and only if on M7 there exist a weak Killing spinor \u03b7 satisfying the following\ndefining condition:\nD\u03b1 \u03b7 = m e \u03c4 \u03b1 \u03b7\nm\n1\nD\u03b7 \u2261 (d \u2212 B \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 )\u03b7 = m e B \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b7\n4\n\n(3.30)\n(3.31)\n\nwhere m is a numerical constant and e is the Freund-Rubin parameter, namely the only\nscale which at the end of the day will occur in the solution.\nThe integrability of the above equation implies that the Ricci tensor be proportional to\nthe identity, namely that the manifold is an Einstein manifold and furthermore fixes the\nproportionality constant:\nR\u03b1\u03ba \u03b2\u03ba = 12 m2 e2 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03bd = 12 m2 e2\n\n(3.32)\n\nIn case such a spinor exists, by setting:\ng\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u03b7 T \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u03b7 = 24 \u03c6?\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n11\n\n(3.33)\n\n\fwe find that Englert equation (3.26) is satisfied, provided we have:\nm=\u2212\n\n3\n2\n\n(3.34)\n\nIn this way Maxwell equation, namely the first of (2.10) is solved. Let us also note, as\nthe authors of [29] did many years ago, that condition (3.30) can also be interpreted in the\nfollowing way. The spin-connection B \u03b1\u03b2 plus the vielbein B \u03b3 define on any non Ricci flat\n7-manifold M7 a connection which is actually SO(8) rather than SO(7) Lie algebra valued.\nIn other words we have a principal SO(8) bundle which leads to an SO(8) spin bundle of\nwhich \u03b7 is a covariantly constant section:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0 = \u2207SO(8) \u03b7 = \u2207SO(7) \u2212 m e B \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b7\n(3.35)\nThe existence of \u03b7 implies a reduction of the SO(8)-bundle. Indeed the stability subgroup of\nan SO(8) spinor is a well known subgroup SO(7)+ different from the standard SO(7) which,\ninstead, stabilizes the vector representation. Hence the so named weak G2 holonomy of\nthe SO(7) spin connection B \u03b1\u03b2 is the\b same thing as the SO(7)+ holonomy of the SO(8) Lie\nalgebra valued de Sitter connection B \u03b1\u03b2 , B \u03b3 introduced in [29] and normally discussed in\nthe old literature on Kaluza Klein Supergravity.\nWe have solved Maxwell equation, but we still have to solve Einstein equation, namely\nthe last of (2.10). To this effect we note that:\nF\u03b2\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3 F \u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03c3 = 24 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03bc = 24\n\n(3.36)\n\nand we observe that Einstein equation reduces to the following two conditions on the parameters (see [26] for details) :\n\u0001\n3\n\u03bb = \u2212 24 e2 + 72 \u03bc f 2\n2\n(3.37)\n3 \u03bd = 12 e2 + 25 \u03bc f 2\n\u00bfFrom eq.s (3.37) we conclude that there are only three possible kind of solutions.\na The flat solutions of type\nM11 = Mink4 \u2297\n\nM\n(3.38)\n|{z}7\nRicci flat\nwhere both D = 4 space-time and the internal 7-space are Ricci flat. These compactifications correspond to e = 0 and F\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = 0 \u21d2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = 0.\nb The Freund Rubin solutions of type\nM11 = AdS4 \u2297\n\nM\n|{z}7\nEinst. manif.\n\n(3.39)\n\nThese correspond to anti de Sitter space in 4-dimensions, whose radius is fixed by the\nFreund Rubin parameter e 6= 0 times any Einstein manifold in 7\u2013dimensions with no\n12\n\n\finternal flux, namely g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = 0. In this case from eq.(3.37) we uniquely obtain:\nRrstu\nR\u03b1\u03ba\n\u03b2\u03ba\nFrstu\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nrs\n\u221216 e2 \u03b4tu\n12 e2 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1\ne \u000frstu\n0\n\n(3.40)\n(3.41)\n(3.42)\n(3.43)\n\nM\n|{z}7\n\n(3.44)\n\nc The Englert type solutions\nM11 = AdS4 \u2297\n\nEinst. manif.\nweak G2 hol\nThese correspond to anti de Sitter space in 4-dimensions (e 6= 0) times a 7\u2013dimensional\nEinstein manifold which is necessarily of weak G2 holonomy in order to support a\nconsistent non vanishing internal flux g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 . In this case combining eq.s (3.37) with\nthe previous ones we uniquely obtain:\n\u03bb = \u221230 e2\n\n;\n\nf = \u00b1 21 e\n\n(3.45)\n\nAs we already mentioned in the introduction there exist several compact manifolds of\nweak G2 holonomy. In particular all the coset manifolds G/H of weak G2 holonomy were\nclassified and studied in the Kaluza Klein supergravity age [31, 26, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 29, 37,\n38] and they were extensively reconsidered in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence\n[39, 40, 41, 42, 43].\nIn the present paper we study the supergauge completion of compactifications of the\nFreund Rubin type, namely on eleven-manifolds of the form:\nM11 = AdS4 \u00d7\n\nG\nH\n\n(3.46)\n\nwith no internal flux g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 switched on. As it was extensively explained in [44] and further\ndeveloped in [39, 40, 41, 42, 43], if the compact coset G/H admits N \u2264 8 Killing spinors\n\u03b7A , namely N \u2264 8 independent solutions of equation (3.30) with m = 1, then the isometry\ngroup G is necessarily of the form:\nG = SO(N ) \u00d7 Gf lavor\n\n(3.47)\n\nwhere Gf lavor is some appropriate Lie group. In this case the isometry supergroup of the\nconsidered M-theory background is:\nOsp(N | 4) \u00d7 Gf lavor\n\n(3.48)\n\nand the spectrum of fluctuations of the background arranges into Osp(N | 4) supermultiplets\nfurthermore assigned to suitable representations of the bosonic flavor group.\n13\n\n\f4\n\nThe SO(8) spinor bundle and the holonomy tensor\n\nWe come next to discuss a very important property of 7\u2013manifolds with a spin structure\nwhich plays a crucial role in understanding the supergauge completion. This is the existence\nof an SO(8) vector bundle whose non trivial connection is defined by the riemannian structure\nof the manifold. To introduce this point and in order to illustrate its relevance to our\nproblem we begin by considering a basis of D = 11 gamma matrices well adapted to the\ncompactification on AdS4 \u00d7 M7 .\n\n4.1\n\nThe well adapted basis of gamma matrices\n\nAccording to the tensor product representation well adapted to the compactification, the\nD = 11 gamma matrices can be written as follows:\n\u0393a = \u03b3a \u2297 18\u00d78 (a = 0, 1, 2, 3)\n\u03933+\u03b1 = \u03b35 \u2297 \u03c4\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, . . . , 7)\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere, following [4] and the old Kaluza Klein supergravity literature [29, 44, 33] the matrices\n\u03c4\u03b1 are the real antisymmetric realization of the SO(7) Clifford algebra with negative metric:\n{\u03c4\u03b1 , \u03c4\u03b2 } = \u2212 2 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u03c4\u03b1 = \u2212 (\u03c4\u03b1 )T\n\n;\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn this basis the charge conjugation matrix is given by:\nC = C \u2297 18\u00d78\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere C is the charge conjugation matrix in d = 4:\nC \u03b3a C \u22121 = \u2212\u03b3aT\n\n4.2\n\n;\n\nC T = \u2212C\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe so(8)-connection and the holonomy tensor\n\nNext we observe that using these matrices the covariant derivative introduced in equation\n(3.35) defines a universal so(8)-connection on the spinor bundle which is given\nthe\n\b \u03b1 once\n\u03b1\u03b2\nriemannian structure, namely the vielbein and the spin connection are given B , B\n:\nUso(8) \u2261 \u2212 41 B \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 e B \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\n\n(4.5)\n\nMore precisely and following the index conventions presented in appendix A, let \u03b6A be an\northonormal basis:\n\u03b6 A \u03b6B = \u03b4AB\n(4.6)\nof sections of the spinor bundle over the Einstein manifold M7 . Any spinor can be written as\na linear combination of these sections that are real. Furthermore the bar operation in this\ncase is simply the transposition. Hence, if we consider the so(8) covariant derivative of any\nof these sections, this is a spinor and, as such, it can be expressed as a linear combinations\nof the same:\n\u0001\n\u2207so(8) \u03b6A \u2261 d + Uso(8) \u03b6A = UAB \u03b6B\n(4.7)\n14\n\n\fAccording to standard lore the 1-form valued, antisymmetric 8 \u00d7 8 matrix UAB defined by\neq.(4.7) is the so(8)-connection in the chosen basis of sections. If the manifold M7 admits\nN Killing spinors, then it follows that we can choose an orthonormal basis where the first\nN sections are Killing spinors:\n\u03b6A = \u03b7A\n\n; \u2207so(8) \u03b7A = 0 ,\n\nA = 1, . . . , N\n\n(4.8)\n\nand the remaining 8 \u2212 N elements of the basis, whose covariant derivative does not vanish\nare orthogonal to the Killing spinors:\n\u03b6\u039b = \u03beA ; \u2207so(8) \u03beA 6= 0 ,\n\u03be B \u03b7A = 0\n\u03be B \u03beC = \u03b4BC\n\nA = 1, . . . , 8 \u2212 N\n(4.9)\n\nIt is then evident from eq.s (4.8) and (4.9) that the so(8)-connection UAB takes values only\nin a subalgebra so(8 \u2212 N ) \u2282 so(8) and has the following block diagonal form:\n!\n0\n0\n(4.10)\nUAB =\n0 UAB\nSquaring the SO(8)-covariant derivative, we find\n\u22072 \u03b6A = (dUAB \u2212 UAC \u2227 UCB ) \u03b6B\n|\n{z\n}\nFAB [U]\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\u03b4\n\n\u2212 41\n\nR\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n|\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 4 e2 \u03b4 \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b3\u03b4 \u03b6A\n{z\n}\n\n(4.11)\n\nC \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2\n\nwhere C \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 is the so called holonomy tensor, essentially identical with the Weyl tensor of\nthe considered Einstein 7-manifold.\n\n4.3\n\nThe holonomy tensor and superspace\n\nAs a further preparation to our subsequent discussion of the gauge completion let us now\nconsider the form taken on the AdS4 \u00d7 G/H backgrounds by the operator Kab introduced in\nequation (2.19) and governing the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. We will see that\nit is just simply related to the holonomy tensor discussed in the previous section, namely to\nthe field strength of the SO(8)-connection on the spinor bundle. To begin with we calculate\nthe operator Fa introduced in eq.s (2.13,2.15). Explicitly using the well adapted basis (4.1)\nfor gamma matrices we find:\n\u001a\nFa = \u22122 e \u03b3a \u03b35 \u2297 18\nFa =\n(4.12)\nF\u03b1 = \u2212e 14 \u2297 \u03c4\u03b1\nUsing this input we obtain:\n\nKab\n\n\uf8f1\nKab = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 Ka\u03b2 = 0\n\u0001\n= K\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 1 R\u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 4 e2 \u03b4 \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b3\u03b4\n\uf8f4\n4\n\uf8f4\n|\n{z\n}\n\uf8f3\nC \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2\n\n15\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fWhere the tensor C \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 defined by the above equation is named the holonomy tensor and it\nis an intrinsic geometric property of the compact internal manifold M7 . As we see the holonomy tensor vanishes only in the case of M7 = S 7 when the Riemann tensor is proportional\nto an antisymmetrized Kronecker delta, namely, when the internal Einstein 7-manifold is\nmaximally symmetric. The holonomy tensor is a 21 \u00d7 21 matrix which projects the SO(7)\nLie algebra to a subalgebra:\nHhol \u2282 SO(7)\n(4.14)\nwith respect to which the 8-component spinor representation should contain singlets in order for unbroken supersymmetries to survive. Indeed the holonomy tensor appears in the\nintegrability condition for Killing spinors. Indeed squaring the defining equation of Killing\nspinors with m = 1 we get the consistency condition:\nC \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b3\u03b4 \u03b7 = 0\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhich states that the Killing spinor directions are in the kernel of the operators C \u03b3\u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b3\u03b4 ,\nnamely are singlets of the subalgebra Hhol generated by them.\nIn view of this we conclude that the gravitino field strength has the following structure:\n\uf8f1\u03c1 = 0\nab\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c1 = 0\na\u03b2\n\u001a\n(4.16)\n\u03c1ab =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 6= 0 ; zero at \u03b8 = 0\ndepends only on the broken \u03b8.s\nAs a preparation for our next coming discussion it is now useful to remind the reader that the\nlist of homogeneous 7-manifolds G/H of Englert type which preserve at least two supersymmetries (N \u2265 2) is extremely short. It consists of the sasakian or tri-sasakian homogeneous\nmanifolds which are displayed in table 1. For these cases our strategy in order to obtain\nthe supergauge completion will be based on a superextension of the sasakian fibration. The\ncases with N = 1 are somewhat more involved since such a weapon is not in our stoke.\nThese cases are also ultra-few and they are displayed in table 2.\n\n16\n\n\fN\n\nName\n\nHolon.\n\nCoset\n\nso(8) bundle\n\nFibration\n(\n\n8\n\nS7\n\nSO(8)\nSO(7)\n\n1\n\n\u2200 p \u2208 P3 ; \u03c0 \u22121 (p) \u223c S1\n(\n\n2\n\nM 111\n\nSU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1)\nSU(2)\u00d7U(1)\u00d7U(1)\n\nSU(3)\n\n2\n\nSU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1)\nU(1)\u00d7U(1)\u00d7U(1)\n\nSU(3)\n\n2\n\nV\n\nSO(5)\nSO(2)\n\nSU(3)\n\n3\n\nSU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\nSU(2)\u00d7U(1)\n\nSU(2)\n\n\u03c0\n\nV 5,2 =\u21d2 Ma \u223c quadric in P4\n\u2200 p \u2208 Ma ; \u03c0 \u22121 (p) \u223c S1\n\n(\nN 010\n\n\u03c0\n\nQ111 =\u21d2 P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1\n\u2200 p \u2208 P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 ; \u03c0 \u22121 (p) \u223c S1\n\n(\n5,2\n\n\u03c0\n\nM 111 =\u21d2 P2 \u00d7 P1\n\u2200 p \u2208 P2 \u00d7 P1 ; \u03c0 \u22121 (p) \u223c S1\n\n(\nQ111\n\n\u03c0\n\nS7 =\u21d2 P3\n\n\u03c0\n\nN 010 =\u21d2 P2\n\u2200 p \u2208 P2 ; \u03c0 \u22121 (p) \u223c S3\n\nTable 1: The homogeneous 7-manifolds that admit at least 2 Killing spinors are all sasakian\nor tri-sasakian.

For\nthis reason we dedicate this section to an in depth analysis of such a supergroup to the\nstructure of its superalgebra described by appropriate Maurer Cartan equations and to the\nexplicit construction of coset representatives for relevant instances of supercosets of the form\nOSp(N |4)/H. This lore will be crucial in our subsequent discussions.\n\n17\n\n\f5.1\n\nThe superalgebra\n\nThe real form osp(N |4) of the complex osp(N |4, C) Lie superalgebra which is relevant for\nthe study of AdS4 \u00d7 G/H compactifications is that one where the ordinary Lie subalgebra is\nthe following:\nsp(4, R) \u00d7 so(N ) \u2282 osp(N |4)\n(5.1)\nThis is quite obvious because of the isomorphism sp(4, R) ' so(2, 3) which identifies sp(4, R)\nwith the isometry algebra of anti de Sitter space. The compact algebra so(8) is instead the\nR-symmetry algebra acting on the supersymmetry charges.\nThe superalgebra osp(N |4) can be introduced as follows: consider the two graded (4 +\nN ) \u00d7 (4 + N ) matrices:\n!\n!\n0\n0\ni\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nC\n\u03b3\n0 5\n5\nb =\nb =\n; H\n(5.2)\nC\ni\n0\n\u2212 4 e 1N \u00d7N\n0\n\u2212 41e 1N \u00d7N\nb has the property that\nwhere C is the charge conjugation matrix in D = 4. The matrix C\nits upper block is antisymmetric while its lower one is symmetric. On the other hand, the\nmatrix H has the property that both its upper and lower blocks are hermitian. The osp(N |4)\nLie algebra is then defined as the set of graded matrices \u039b satisfying the two conditions:\nb +C\nb\u039b = 0\n\u039bT C\nb +H\nb\u039b = 0\n\u039b\u2020 H\n\n(5.3)\n(5.4)\n\nEq.(5.3) defines the complex osp(N |4) superalgebra while eq.(5.4) restricts it to the appropriate real section where the ordinary Lie subalgebra is (5.1).

Indeed the gravitino 1\u2013form is a\nMajorana spinor since, by construction, it satisfies the reality condition\nT\n\n\u03c8 A \u2261 \u03c8A\u2020 \u03b30 .\n\nC \u03c8 A = \u03c8A ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nThe supermanifold AdS4|N \u00d74 can be identified with the following supercoset:\nM4|4N\n\u2261\nosp\n\nOsp(N | 4)\nSO(N ) \u00d7 SO(1, 3)\n\n(5.9)\n\nAlternatively, the Maurer Cartan equations can be written in the following more compact\nform:\n\nd\u03a6xA + \u2206xy\n\nd\u2206xy + \u2206xz \u2227 \u2206ty \u000fzt = \u2212 4 i e \u03a6xA \u2227 \u03a6yA ,\ndAAB \u2212 eAAC \u2227 ACB = 4 i\u03a6xA \u2227 \u03a6yB \u000fxy\n\u2227 \u000fyz \u03a6zA \u2212 e AAB \u2227 \u03a6xB = 0\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere all 1-forms are real and, according to the conventions discussed in appendix A, the\nindices x, y, z, t are symplectic and take four values. The real symmetric bosonic 1-form\n\u03a9xy = \u03a9yx encodes the generators of the Lie subalgebra sp(4, R), while the antisymmetric\nreal bosonic 1-form AAB = \u2212ABA encodes the generators of the Lie subalgebra so(N ).\nThe fermionic 1-forms \u03a6xA are real and, as indicated by their indices, they transform in the\nfundamental 4-dim representation of sp(4, R) and in the fundamental N -dim representation\nof so(N ).

(B.10) and the matrix\nC \u03b35 turns out to be proportional to \u000fxy as shown in eq. (B.9). On the other hand a Majorana\nspinor in this basis is proportional to a real object times a phase factor exp[\u2212 \u03c0 i / 4].\nHence eq.s (5.7) and eq.s (5.10) are turned ones into the others upon the identifications:\n\u03a9xy \u000fyz \u2261\n\n\u03a9x z \u2194 \u2212 14 \u03c9 ab \u03b3ab \u2212 2 e \u03b3a \u03b35 E a\nAAB \u2194 AAB\n\u0002 \u0003 x\n\u03c8Ax \u2194 exp \u2212\u03c0i\n\u03a6A\n4\n\n(5.12)\n\nAs is always the case, the Maurer Cartan equations are just a property of the (super)\nLie algebra and hold true independently of the (super) manifold on which the 1-forms are\nrealized: on the supergroup manifold or on different supercosets of the same supergroup.\n19\n\n\f5.2\n\nThe relevant supercosets and their relation\n\nWe have already introduced the supercoset (5.9) which includes anti de Sitter space and has\n4 bosonic coordinates and 4 \u00d7 N fermionic ones. Let us also consider the following pure\nfermionic coset:\nM0|4N\n=\nosp\n\nOsp(N | 4)\nSO(N ) \u00d7 Sp(4, R)\n\n(5.13)\n\nThere is an obvious relation between these two supercosets that can be formulated in the\nfollowing way:\n0|4N\nM4|4N\n\u223c AdS4 \u00d7 Mosp\n(5.14)\nosp\nIn order to explain the actual meaning of eq.(5.14) we proceed as follows. Let the graded\n4|4N\nmatrix L \u2208 Osp(N |4) be the coset representative of the coset Mosp , such that the Maurer\nCartan form \u039b of eq.(5.5) can be identified as:\n\u039b = L\u22121 dL\n\n(5.15)\n\nL = LF LB\n\n(5.16)\n\nLet us now factorize L as follows:\nwhere LF is a coset representative for the coset :\nOsp(N | 4)\n3 LF\nSO(N ) \u00d7 Sp(4, R)\nand LB is the Osp(N |4) embedding of a coset representative of AdS4 , namely:\n!\nLB 0\nSp(4, R)\nLB =\n;\n3 LB\nSO(1, 3)\n0 1N\n\n(5.17)\n\n(5.18)\n\nIn this way we find:\n\u22121\n\u039b = L\u22121\nB \u039bF LB + LB d LB\n\nLet us now write the explicit form of \u039bF in analogy to eq.(5.5):\n!\n\u2206F\n\u0398A\n\u039bF =\n4 i e \u0398A \u03b35 \u2212 e AeAB\n\n(5.19)\n\n(5.20)\n\nwhere \u0398A is a Majorana-spinor valued fermionic 1-form and where \u2206F is an sp(4, R) Lie\nalgebra valued 1-form presented as a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix. Both \u0398A as \u2206F and AeAB depend only\non the fermionic \u03b8 coordinates and differentials.\nOn the other hand we have:\n!\n\u2206\n0\nB\nL\u22121\n(5.21)\nB d LB =\n0 0\n\n20\n\n\fwhere the \u03a9B is also an sp(4, R) Lie algebra valued 1-form presented as a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix, but\nit depends only on the bosonic coordinates x\u03bc of the anti de Sitter space AdS4 . Indeed,\naccording to eq(5.5) we can write:\n\u2206B = \u2212 14 B ab \u03b3ab \u2212 2 e \u03b3a \u03b35 B a\n\n(5.22)\n\n\b\n\nab\nwhere\n, B a are respectively the spin-connection and the vielbein of AdS4 , just as\n\b \u03b1\u03b2 B\n\u03b1\nB , B are the connection and vielbein of the internal coset manifold M7 .\nInserting now these results into eq.(5.19) and comparing with eq.(5.5) we obtain:\n\n\u03c8A = L\u22121\nB \u0398A\nAAB = AeAB\n\u2212 41 \u03c9 ab \u03b3ab \u2212 2 e \u03b3a \u03b35 E a = \u2212 14 B ab \u03b3ab \u2212 2 e \u03b3a \u03b35 B a + L\u22121\nB \u2206F LB\n\n(5.23)\n\nThe above formulae encode an important information. They show how the supervielbein\nand the superconnection of the supermanifold (5.9) can be constructed starting from the\nvielbein and connection of AdS4 space plus the Maurer Cartan forms of the purely fermionic\nsupercoset (5.13). In other words formulae (5.23) provide the concrete interpretation of the\ndirect product (5.14). This will also be our starting point for the actual construction of the\nsupergauge completion in the case of maximal supersymmetry and for its generalization to\nthe cases of less supersymmetry.\n\n5.3\n\nFinite supergroup elements\n\nWe studied the osp(N |4) superalgebra but for our purposes we cannot confine ourselves to\nthe superalgebra, we need also to consider finite elements of the corresponding supergroup.\nIn particular the supercoset representative. Elements of the supergroup are described by\ngraded matrices of the form:\n!\nA \u0398\n(5.24)\nM=\n\u03a0 D\nwhere A, D are submatrices made out of even elements of a Grassmann algebra while \u0398, \u03a0\nare submatrices made out of odd elements of the same Grassmann algebra. It is important to\nrecall, that the operations of transposition and hermitian conjugation are defined as follows\non graded matrices:\n!\nT\nT\n\u03a0\nA\nMT =\n\u2212 \u0398T DT\n!\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03a0\nA\nM\u2020 =\n(5.25)\n\u0398\u2020 D\u2020\nThis is done in order to preserve for the supertrace the same formal properties enjoyed by\nthe trace of ordinary matrices:\nStr (M ) = Tr (A) \u2212 Tr (D)\nStr (M1 M2 ) = Str (M2 M1 )\n21\n\n(5.26)\n\n\fEq.s (5.25) and (5.26) have an important consequence. The consistency of the equation:\n\u0001?\n(5.27)\nM\u2020 = MT\nimplies that the complex conjugate operation on a super matrix must be defined as follows:\n!\n?\n?\nA\n\u2212\u0398\nM? =\n(5.28)\n\u03a0? D ?\nLet us now observe that in the Majorana basis which we have adopted we have:\n!\n0\n\u000f\nb = i\n= ib\n\u000f\nC\n1\n1N \u00d7N\n0 \u2212 4e\n!\ni\n\u000f\n0\nb =\nH\n1\n1N \u00d7N\n0 \u2212 4e\n\n(5.29)\n\nwhere the 4 \u00d7 4 matrix \u000f is given by eq.(B.9). Therefore in this basis an orthosymplectic\ngroup element L \u2208 OSp(N |4) which satisfies:\nbL = C\nb\nLT C\nbL = H\nb\nL\u2020 H\n\n(5.30)\n(5.31)\n\nhas the following structure:\nL =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 !\nexp \u2212 i \u03c04 \u0398\n\nS\n\u0002\n\u0003\nexp \u2212 i \u03c04 \u03a0\n\nO\n\n(5.32)\n\nwhere the bosonic sub-blocks S, O are respectively 4 \u00d7 4 and N \u00d7 N and real, while the\nfermionic ones \u0398, \u03a0 are respectively 4 \u00d7 N and N \u00d7 4 and also real.\nThe orthosymplectic conditions (5.30) translate into the following conditions on the subblocks:\n1\n\u03a0T \u03a0\nS T \u000f S = \u000f \u2212 i 4e\n\nOT O = 1 + i 4e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\n1\n\u03a0T O\nS T \u000f \u0398 = \u2212 4e\n\n(5.33)\n\nAs we see, when the fermionic off-diagonal sub-blocks are zero the diagonal ones are respectively a symplectic and an orthogonal matrix.\nIf the graded matrix L is regarded as the coset representative of either one of the two\nsupercosets (5.9,5.13), we can evaluate the explicit structure of the left-invariant one form\n\u039b. Using the M0|4\u00d7N style of the Maurer Cartan equations (5.10) we obtain:\n\uf8eb\n\u0002\n\u0003 \uf8f6\n\u2206\nexp \u2212i \u03c04 \u03a6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u039b \u2261 L\u22121 dL = \uf8ec\n(5.34)\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u0002 \u03c0\u0003 T\n\u22124e exp \u2212i 4 \u03a6 \u000f\n\u2212eA\n22\n\n\fwhere the 1-forms \u2206, A and \u03a6 can be explicitly calculated, using the explicit form of the\ninverse coset representative:\n!\n\u0002 \u03c0\u0003 1\nT\nT\n\u000f\u03a0\n\u2212\u000f\nS\n\u000f\nexp\n\u2212i\n4 4e\nL\u22121 =\n(5.35)\n\u0002 \u03c0\u0003\nT\n\u2212 exp \u2212i 4 4e \u0398 \u000f\nOT\neA = \u2212 OT dO \u2212 i 4e \u0398T \u000f d\u0398\n1\n\u03a9 = \u2212 \u000f S T \u000f dS \u2212 i 4e\n\u03a0T d\u03a0\n\u03a6 =\n\n5.4\n\n\u2212 \u000f S T \u000f d\u0398 +\n\n1\n4e\n\n\u000f \u03a0T dO\n\n(5.36)\n\nThe coset representative of OSp(N |4)/Sp(4) \u00d7 SO(N )\n\nIt is fairly simple to write an explicit form for the coset representative of the fermionic\nsupermanifold\nOSp(N |4)\n(5.37)\nM0|4\u00d7N =\nSp(4, R) \u00d7 SO(N )\nby adopting the upper left block components \u0398 of the supermatrix (5.32) as coordinates. It\nsuffices to solve eq.s(5.33) for the sub blocks S, O, \u03a0. Such an explicit solution is provided\nby setting:\n\u00011/2\nO(\u0398) = 1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\n\u00011/2\nS(\u0398) = 1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\n\u0001\u22121/2 T\n\u00011/2\n\u03a0 = 4e 1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\n\u0398 \u000f 1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\n= 4e \u0398T \u000f\n\n(5.38)\n\nIn this way we conclude that the coset representative of the fermionic supermanifold (5.37)\ncan be chosen to be the following supermatrix:\n!\n\u00011/2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\nexp \u2212 i \u03c04 \u0398\nL (\u0398) =\n(5.39)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00011/2\n\u2212 exp \u2212 i \u03c04 4e \u0398T \u000f 1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\nBy straightforward steps from eq.(5.35) we obtain the inverse of the supercoset element\n(5.39) in the form:\n!\n\u00011/2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\n\u2212 exp \u2212 i \u03c04 \u0398\n\u22121\nL (\u0398) = L (\u2212 \u0398) =\n(5.40)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00011/2\nexp \u2212 i \u03c04 4e \u0398T \u000f\n1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\nCorrespondingly we work out the explicit expression of the Maurer Cartan forms:\n\u00011/2\n\u00011/2\neA = 1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\nd 1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\n\u2212 i 4e \u0398T \u000f d\u0398\n\u00011/2\n\u00011/2\n\u03a6 = 1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\nd\u0398 + \u0398 d 1 + 4 i e \u0398T \u000f \u0398\n\u00011/2\n\u00011/2\n\u2206 = 1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\nd 1 + 4 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\n\u2212 i 4e \u0398 d\u0398T \u000f\n23\n\n(5.41)\n\n\f5.5\n\nGauged Maurer Cartan 1-forms of OSp(8|4)\n\nA fundamental ingredient in the construction of gauged supergravities is constituted by the\ngauging of Maurer Cartan forms of the scalar coset manifold G/H (see for instance [47]\nfor a survey of the subject). The vector fields present in the supermultiplet, which are\n1-forms defined over the space-time manifold M4 , are used to deform the Maurer Cartan\n1-forms of the scalar manifold G/H that are instead sections of T ? (G/H). Mutatis mutandis,\na similar construction turns out to be quite essential in the problem of gauge completion\nunder consideration. In our case what will be gauged are the Maurer Cartan 1-forms of the\nsupercoset (5.13) which contains the fermionic coordinates of the final superspace we desire\nto construct. The role of the space-time gauge fields is instead played by the U-connection\n(4.5) of the so(8) spinor bundle constructed over the internal 7-manifold (G/H)7 .\nAccordingly we define:\n\u0010\nh\ni\u0011\nb,L\nb \u2261 L\u22121 \u2207 L = L\u22121 d L + U\n\u039b\n(5.42)\nb is the supermatrix defined by the canonical immersion of the so(8) Lie algebra into\nwhere U\nthe orthosymplectic superalgebra:\n!\n0\n0\nb =\n= I (U)\nU\n0 U\nI\n\n:\n\nso(8) 7\u2192 osp(8|4)\n\n(5.43)\n\nAs a result of their definition, the gauged Maurer Cartan forms satisfy the following deformed\nMaurer Cartan equations:\nh\ni\n\u22121\n[\nb\nb\nb\n\u2207\u039b + \u039b \u2227 \u039b = L (\u0398) F [U] , L (\u0398)\n(5.44)\nwhere\n0\n\nF[\n[U] =\n\n0\n\n0 F [U]\n\n!\n(5.45)\n\nBy explicit evaluation, from eq.(5.44) we obtain the following deformation of the Maurer\nCartan equations (5.10):\nb xy + \u2206\nb xz \u2227 \u2206\nb ty \u000fzt + 4 i e \u03a6\nb xA \u2227 \u03a6\nb y , = \u2212 i \u0398xA FAB [U] \u0398y\nd\u2206\nA\nB\ny\nx\nb \u2227\u03a6\nb \u000fxy = OAP (\u0398) FP Q [U] OQB (\u0398) \u2212 FAB [U]\n\u2207AbAB \u2212 eAbAC \u2227 AbCB \u2212 4 i\u03a6\nA\nB\nx\nxy\nz\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb xB = \u0398xP FP Q [U] OQA (\u0398)\nd\u03a6A + \u2206 \u2227 \u000fyz \u03a6A \u2212 e AAB \u2227 \u03a6\n(5.46)\nThe above equations will be our main starting point in the discussion of the supergauge\ncompletion for compactifications with less preserved supersymmetry.\n\n24\n\n\f5.6\n\nConstrained superspace and the supersolvable parametrization\n\nIn [11] it was demonstrated that, in full analogy with the solvable parametrization of non\ncompact bosonic coset manifolds, extensively utilized while dealing with the scalar sector of\nsupergravity models, one can introduce also a supersolvable parametrization of the super4|4\u00d7N\nmanifold Mosp\ndefined in eq.(5.9) (see [48, 11]). This latter is the supergroup manifold\nof a solvable super Lie subalgebra SSolv4|N \u2282 Osp(N |4). Similarly to the bosonic case\nthe solvable parametrization of the supermanifold leads to an enormous simplification of\nthe Maurer Cartan forms since the coset representative becomes polynomial in its parameters, yet differently from the bosonic case the supersolvable algebra SSolv4|N has smaller\n4|4\u00d7N\ndimension than the dimension of the original coset Mosp . In other words the supergroup\nmanifold:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nSM4|2\u00d7N \u2261 exp SSolv4|N\n(5.47)\ndoes not contain all the \u0398-coordinates but only a subset. Actually as it is implied by the\nchosen notation, the solvable supergroup manifold SM4|2\u00d7N contains just one-half of the\nthetas, namely 2 \u00d7 N . In [11] this was interpreted in terms of \u03ba-supersymmetry. Indeed it\nwas advocated that starting from the general \u03ba-supersymmetric action of the M 2-brane, one\ncan localize it on an AdS4 \u00d7 S7 background in a form where all \u03ba-supersymmetry are already\ngauged-fixed. This is the form taken by the general action when the Maurer Cartan forms\nof Osp(N |4) are written in the supersolvable parametrization. Alternatively one realizes\nthat the solvable super Lie algebra SSolv4|N is nothing else but the N -extended Poincar\u00e9\nsuperalgebra in three-space time dimensions, i.e. on the membrane world-volume, while\nthe complete Osp(N |4) algebra is simply the superconformal extension of such an algebra.\nHence the supermanifold (5.47) is just the ordinary Poincar\u00e9 superspace for field theories on\nthe membrane and the used thetas are the superPoincar\u00e9 ones while those deleted are the\nparameters of conformal supersymmetry which can be non linear realized on the Poincar\u00e9\nones.\nExplicitly the supersolvable parametrization works as follows. We look for a decomposition of the Osp(N |4) algebra of the following form:\nOsp(N |4)\n\b\nwhere Q = QA\n\u2212\noperator P\u00b1\n\n=\n\n(SO(1, 3) \u2297 SO(N ) \u2297 Q) \u2295 SSolv4|N ,\n\n(5.48)\n\nis a subset of the fermionic generators defined by a suitable projection\nQA\n\u2212\nQA\n+\nP\u00b12\n\n= P\u2212 * QA\n= P+ * QA ,\n= P\u00b1 ; P+ * P\u2212 = 0.\n\n(5.49)\n\nThe main idea underlying the construction rules of the supersolvable algebra generating\nSM4|2\u00d7N as well as the solvable algebra generating anti de Sitter space is that of grading. The\nCartan generator contained in the coset of AdS4 defines a partition of the isometry generators\ninto eigenspaces corresponding to positive, negative or null eigenvalues (g(\u00b11) , sg(\u00b11/2) , sg(0) )\n25\n\n\fand the structure of the solvable and supersolvable algebras (Solv and SSolv) is the following:\ng = SO(2, 3) \u223c Sp(4, R)\nSolv4\nsg = Osp(N |4)\nsg(0)\nSSolv4|N\n\n\u2192 g(\u22121) \u2295 g(0) \u2295 g(+1) ,\n= {C} \u2295 g(\u22121) ,\n\u2192 g(\u22121) \u2295 sg(0) \u2295 g(+1) \u2295 sg(\u22121/2) \u2295 sg(1/2) ,\n= g(0) \u2295 SO(N ),\n= {C} \u2295 g(\u22121) \u2295 sg(\u22121/2) ,\n\n(5.50)\n\nwhere sg(\u00b11/2) represents the grading induced by the Cartan generator on the fermionic\nisometries and the eigenspace sg(+1/2) not entering the construction of SSolv is the space\nQ = {QA\n+ } in eq. (5.48) and generates the special conformal transformations. Moreover\nthese generators on the chosen solution of the world volume theory, generate the local \u03basupersymmetry transformations. As shown in [11] the projection operator which singles out\nthe subspaces sg(\u00b11/2) is simply given in terms of 4D-gamma matrices as follows:\nP\u00b1\nsg(\u00b11/2)\n\n1\n( \u00b1 \u03b3 5 \u03b3 2 ),\n2\nA\n= {QA\n\u00b1 } = {P\u00b1 Q }.\n\n=\n\n(5.51)\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that such a projection is compatible with the Majorana condition and it is immediate to solve such a constraint in the basis of gamma matrices described\nin appendix B.2. Indeed we find:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nQA\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nQA\n2\nA\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(5.52)\nQ\u00b1 = \uf8ec\nA \uf8f7\n\u2213Q\n\uf8ed\n2 \uf8f8\n\u00b1QA\n1\nThis implies that the corresponding \u0398-coordinates have the same structure:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u0398A\u00b1\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u0398A\u00b1\n2\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u0398 = \u0398+ \u2295 \u0398\u2212 ; \u0398\u00b1 = \uf8ec\nA\u00b1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \u2213\u03982 \uf8f8\n\u00b1\u0398A\u00b1\n1\n\n(5.53)\n\nNext it can be immediately verified that the projected \u0398.s satisfy the following constraints:\n\u0398xA = \u0398xA\u00b1\n\u21d3\ny\nx\n\u0398A \u0398B \u000fxy = 0 and \u0398xA d\u0398yB \u000fxy = \u0398xB d\u0398yA \u000fxy\n\n(5.54)\n(5.55)\n\nAs explained in the introduction, in this paper we take a different point of view. Rather then\nusing the solvable parametrization we take the complete parametrization of the supercosets\n(either M4|4\u00d7N or M4|4\u00d7N ) but we enforce the constraints (5.55) on the fermionic coordinates\ncutting out a sixteen dimensional locus in the 32-dimensional one. In this way we preserve\nall the symmetries and yet we obtain a formidable simplification of the Maurer Cartan forms\nwhich allows to pursue the gauge completion programme to its very end.\n26\n\n\f5.7\n\nGauged Maurer Cartan forms in constrained superspace\n\nLet us now consider the consequences of the constraints (5.55) on the coset representative\n(5.39), the Maurer Cartan forms (5.41) and their gauged counterparts (5.42). On the constrained surface we immediately find:\nO(\u0398)\nS(\u0398)\nAb\nb\n\u2206\n\n= 1\n= 1 + 2 i e \u0398 \u0398T \u000f\n= A = 0\n\u0001\n= 2 i \u2207\u0398 \u0398T \u2212 \u0398 \u2207\u0398T\n\n(5.56)\n\nand the gauged Maurer Cartan equations (5.46) become:\nb xy + \u2206\nb xz \u2227 \u2206\nb ty \u000fzt + 4 i e \u03a6\nb xA \u2227 \u03a6\nb y , = \u2212 i \u0398xA FAB [U] \u0398y\nd\u2206\nA\nB\n0 = 0\nbx + \u2206\nb xy \u2227 \u000fyz \u03a6\nb z = \u0398x FP A [U]\nd\u03a6\nA\nA\nP\n\n(5.57)\n\nAs we are going to show in the sequel, the above equations enable us to write a complete\nparametrization of all the FDA superforms adapted to any background AdS4 \u00d7 (G/H)7 .\n\n6\n\nKilling spinors of the AdS4 manifold\n\nThe next main item for the construction of the supergauge completion is given by the Killing\nspinors of anti de Sitter space. Indeed, in analogy with the Killing spinors of the internal\n7-manifold, defined by eq.(3.30) with m = 1, we can now introduce the notion of Killing\nspinors of the AdS4 space and recognize how they can be constructed in terms of the coset\nrepresentative, namely in terms of the fundamental harmonic of the coset.\nThe analogue of eq.(3.30) is given by:\n\u0001\n(6.1)\n\u2207Sp(4) \u03c7x \u2261 d \u2212 14 B ab \u03b3ab \u2212 2 e \u03b3a \u03b35 B a \u03c7x = 0\nand states that the Killing spinor is a covariantly constant section of the sp(4, R) bundle\ndefined over AdS4 . This bundle is flat since the vanishing of the sp(4, R) curvature is nothing\nelse but the Maurer Cartan equation of sp(4, R) and hence corresponds to the structural\nequations of the AdS4 manifold. We are therefore guaranteed that there exists a basis\nof four linearly independent sections of such a bundle, namely four linearly independent\nsolutions of eq.(6.1) which we can normalize as follows:\n\u03c7x \u03b35 \u03c7y = i (C \u03b35 )xy\n\n(6.2)\n\nLet LB the coset representative mentioned in eq.(5.18) and satisfying:\n\u2212\n\n1\n4\n\nB ab \u03b3ab \u2212 2 e \u03b3a \u03b35 B a = \u2206B = L\u22121\nB dLB\n\n(6.3)\n\nIt follows that the inverse matrix L\u22121\nB satisfies the equation:\n(d + \u2206B ) L\u22121\nB = 0\n27\n\n(6.4)\n\n\f\u0001y\nRegarding the first index y of the matrix L\u22121\nx as the spinor index acted on by the conB\nnection \u2206B and the second index x as the labeling enumerating the Killing spinors, eq.(6.4)\nis identical with eq.(6.1) and hence we have explicitly constructed its four independent solutions. In\u0002order \u0003to achieve the desired normalization (6.2) it suffices to multiply by a phase\nfactor exp \u2212i 41 \u03c0 , namely it suffices to set:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0001y\n\u03c7y(x) = exp \u2212i 14 \u03c0 L\u22121\n(6.5)\nx\nB\nIn this way the four Killing spinors fulfill the Majorana condition. Furthermore since L\u22121\nB is\nsymplectic it satisfies the defining relation\nL\u22121\nB C \u03b35 LB = C \u03b35\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhich implies (6.2).\n\n7\n\nSupergauge completion in mini superspace\n\nAs it was observed many years ago in [29, 44] and it is reviewed at length in the book [23],\ngiven a bosonic Freund Rubin compactification of M-theory on an internal coset manifold\nG\nwhich admits N Killing spinors it is fairly easy to extend it consistently to a miniM7 = H\nsuperspace M11|4\u00d7N which contains all of the eleven bosonic coordinates but only 4 \u00d7 N\n\u03b8.s, namely those which are associated with unbroken supersymmetries. We review this\nextension reformulating it in such a way that it is suitable for its generalization to all \u03b8.s\nnamely also to those associated with broken supersymmetries.\nIn the original formulation, the mini superspace is viewed as the following tensor product\n4|4N\nM11|4\u00d7N \u2261 Mosp\n\u00d7\n\nG\nH\n\n(7.1)\n\nand in order to construct the FDA p\u2013forms, in addition to the Maurer Cartan forms of the\nabove coset, we just need to introduce the Killing spinors of the bosonic internal manifold.\nLet \u03b7 A be an orthonormal basis of N eight component Killing spinors satisfying the Killing\nspinor condition (3.31) and the normalization:\n\u0001T\n\u03b7 A \u03b7 B = \u03b4 AB\n(7.2)\nNext, following [23] and [11], whose results were also summarized in [4], we can now write\nG\nthe complete solution for the background fields in the case of AdS4 \u00d7 H\nFreund-Rubin\nbackgrounds :\n(\nVb a = E a\nVb a =\nb \u03b1 = B \u03b1 \u2212 1 \u03b7 A \u03c4 \u03b1 \u03b7B AAB\n8\n\uf8f1V\nab\nab\n\uf8f4\nb\n= \u03c9\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c9\n(7.3)\nab\n\u03b1b\n\u03c9\nb\n=\n\u03c9\nb\n= 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c9\nb \u03b1\u03b2 = B \u03b1\u03b2 + 4e \u03b7 A \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b7B AAB\nb = \u03b7A \u2297 \u03c8A\n\u03a8\n28\n\n\f\b\nwhere B \u03b1\u03b2 , B \u03b1 are the spin connection and the vielbein, respectively, of the bosonic seven\nG\ndimensional coset manifold H\n.\nLet us now observe that in this formulation of the superextension, the fermionic coordinates are actually attached to the space-time manifold AdS4 , which is superextended to a\nsupercoset manifold:\nAdS4\n\nsuperextension\n=\u21d2\n\nOsp(N | 4)\n\u2261 M4|4\u00d7N\nSO(N ) \u00d7 SO(1, 3)\n\n(7.4)\n\nG\nAt the same time the internal manifold M7 = H\nis regarded as purely bosonic and it is\ntwisted into the fabric of the Free Differential Algebra through the notion of the Killing\nspinors \u03b7A , defined as covariantly constant sections of the SO(8) spinor bundle over M7 .\nYet whether supersymmetries are preserved or broken precisely depends on the structure\nof the SO(8) spinor bundle on M7 . Henceforth it is suggestive to think that the fermionic\ncoordinates should not be attached to either the internal or to external manifold, rather they\nshould live as a fiber over the bosonic manifolds. The first step in order to realize such a\nprogramme consists of a reformulation of the superextension in minisuperspace that treats\nthe space-time manifold AdS4 and the internal manifold M7 in a symmetric way and in\nboth instances relies on the notion of Killing spinors of the bosonic submanifold as a way\nof including the fermionic one. This can be easily done in view of eq.(5.14) whose precise\nmeaning we have explained in section 5.2. Indeed in view of eq.(5.14) we can look at at\neq.(7.1) in the following equivalent, but more challenging fashion:\n\nM11|4\u00d7N = AdS4 \u00d7 M0|4\u00d7N \u00d7 M7\nG\nOsp(N | 4)\nSp(4, R)\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u2261\nSO(1, 3)\nSO(N ) \u00d7 Sp(4, R)\nH\n|{z}\n{z\n}\n| {z }\n|\nAdS4\n\n4\u00d7N\n\nfermionic manifold\n\n(7.5)\n\nM7\n\nThe above equation simply corresponds to the rewriting of eq.(7.3) in the following way\n(\nVb a = B a \u2212 81e \u03c7x \u03b3 a \u03c7y \u2206xy\nF\nVb a =\n1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\n= B \u2212 8 \u03b7 A \u03c4 \u03b7B AAB\n\uf8f1V\n\uf8f4\nb ab = B ab + 12 \u03c7x \u03b35 \u03b3 ab \u03c7y \u2206xy\n\uf8f4\nF\n\uf8f2 \u03c9\n(7.6)\n\u03c9\nb ab =\n\u03c9\nb \u03b1b = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c9\nb \u03b1\u03b2 = B \u03b1\u03b2 + e \u03b7 \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b7 A\n4\n\nA\n\nB\n\nAB\n\nb = \u03b7A \u2297 \u03c7x \u03a6x|A\n\u03a8\n\n8\n\nGauge completion in the full constrained superspace\n\nWe are now in a position to write an ansatz which solves the rheonomic parametrization of\nthe FDA curvatures for any AdS4 \u00d7 (G/H)7 back ground and involves all the \u0398\u2013coordinates\nalthough constrained. The extension to mini-superspace provided by eq.s(7.6) is our starting\n\n29\n\n\fpoint. In those equations the Maurer Cartan forms are those (ungauged ) of the supermanifold:\nOsp(N |4)\n(8.1)\nSp(4, R) \u00d7 SO(N)\nand therefore are written in terms of 4 \u00d7 N unconstrained fermionic coordinates. The\nsummation on the indices A, B, C is on N \u2013values since \u03b7A are just the Killing spinors. The\nMC-forms are ungauged because, by definition, there is no U-connection in the directions\nspanned by the Killing spinors.\nThe new solution in complete constrained superspace has the following form:\n(\nb xy\nVb a = B a \u2212 81e \u03c7x \u03b3 a \u03c7y \u2206\nF\na\nb\nV =\n1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\nb\n= B \u2212 8 \u03b6 A \u03c4 \u03b6B AAB = B \u03b1\n\uf8f1V\nb xy\n\uf8f4\nb ab = B ab + 12 \u03c7x \u03b35 \u03b3 ab \u03c7y \u2206\n\uf8f4\nF\n\uf8f2 \u03c9\n(8.2)\nab\n\u03b1b\n\u03b1b\n\u03c9\nb\n=\n\u03c9\nb\n= \u2206\u03c9\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c9\nb \u03b1\u03b2 = B \u03b1\u03b2 + 4e \u03b6 A \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b6B AbAB = B \u03b1\u03b2 + \u2206\u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2\nb = \u03b6A \u2297 \u03c7x \u03a6\nb x|A\n\u03a8\nThe modifications that have occurred with respect to eq.(7.6) are the following ones:\n1. The indices A, B, C run on 8-values and rather then the Killing spinors \u03b7A we have a\ncomplete basis of sections \u03b6A of the so(8) spin bundle.\n2. The MC forms are those of the supermanifold\nOsp(8|4)\nSp(4, R) \u00d7 SO(8)\n\n(8.3)\n\nbut they are not the ordinary ones, A, \u2206, \u03a6, rather those gauged by means of the Ub \u2206,\nb \u03a6.\nb\nconnection on the so(8)-spinor bundle over G/H. This is signaled by the hat: A,\n3. The 32 coordinates of the supermanifold (8.3) are not free, rather they are subject to\nthe constraints (5.55). This implies in particular that Ab vanishes.\n4. The spin connection contains a correction term which is due to the gauging and which\nwe easily calculate below. In particular due to this correction the mixed components\n\u03c9 \u03b1b are no longer zero.\nIt is fairly easy to verify by direct evaluation that the ansatz (8.2) verifies the torsion equation\n(2.5) and the gravitino equation (2.8). The mixed part of the spin connection is just a\nconsequence of the F-deformation of the Maurer Cartan equation appearing in the first of\neq.s(5.57). By explicit evaluation we find that without introducing the correction \u2206\u03c9 ab the\ntorsion is not zero, rather it is given by:\n(\nT a = cost \u03c7x \u03b3 a \u03c7y \u03b6A \u03c4\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b6B \u0398xA \u0398yB C \u03c1\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 B \u03b1 \u2227 B \u03b2\na\nT =\n(8.4)\nT\u03b1 = 0\n30\n\n\fIn view of the parametrization (8.2) this means that the torsion is of the form:\nT a = H a|bc Vb \u2227 Vc\nH a|\u03b2\u03b3 = cost \u03c7x \u03b3 a \u03c7y \u03b6A \u03c4\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b6B \u0398xA \u0398yB C \u03c1\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2\nall other components of H a|bc = 0\n\n(8.5)\n\nwhich can be reabsorbed by the following redefinition of the spin connection:\n\u03c9 ab \u2192\n7\n\u03c9 ab + \u2206\u03c9 ab\n\u0001\n\u2206\u03c9 ab = \u2212 H a|bc \u2212 H b|ac \u2212 H c|ab V c\n\n8.1\n\n(8.6)\n\nThe 3\u2013form\n\nWe have found an explicit expression for the supervielbein V a , the gravitino 1\u2013form \u03a8 and\nant he spin-connection \u03c9 ab . In order to complete the description of the superextension we\nneed also to provide an expression for the 3-form A[3] . According to the general definitions\nof the FDA curvatures eq.(2.3) and the rheonomic parametrization (2.6) we find that:\ndA[3] = F[4] \u2212 12 \u03a8 \u2227 \u0393ab \u03a8 \u2227 V a \u2227 V b\n\u21d3\n[3]\ndA\n= e \u000fabcd E a \u2227 E b \u2227 E c \u2227 E d + 12 \u03c7x \u03b3ab \u03c7y \u03a6xA \u2227 \u03a6y \u2227 E a \u2227 E b\n\n(8.7)\n\n+ 12 \u03c7x \u03c7y \u03b6A \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b6B \u03a6xA \u2227 \u03a6yB \u2227 B \u03b1 \u2227 B \u03b2\n+ \u03c7x \u03b3a \u03b35 \u03c7y \u03b6A \u03c4\u03b2 \u03b6B \u03a6xA \u2227 \u03a6yB \u2227 E a \u2227 B \u03b2\n\n(8.8)\n\nThe expression of dA[3] as a 4\u2013form is completely explicit in eq.(8.8) and by construction\nit is integrable in the sense that d2 A[3] = 0. One might desire to solve this equation by\nfinding a suitable expression for A[3] such that eq.(8.8) is satisfied. This is not possible in\ngeneral terms, namely by using only the invariant constraints (5.55). In order to find explicit\nsolutions, one needs to use some explicit coordinate system and some explicit solution of the\nconstraints. For instance using the solvable parametrization it was shown in paper ([11])\nhow to write A[3] in the case of the seven sphere. This analysis could be pursued also for the\nother instances of compactifications with less supersymmetry, but it is not in the spirit we\nhave adopted. Here it is just the constraints what matters, not their explicit solutions.\nIn the main application we have in mind, namely while localizing the pure spinor BRST\ninvariant action of the supermembrane M2 on such backgrounds, we can easily avoid all such\nproblems. We simply substitute the world volume integral of A[3] with:\nZ\nZ\n[3]\nA 7\u2192\ndA[3]\n(8.9)\nW V3\n\nW V4\n\nwhere the 4\u2013dimensional integration volume W V4 is such that its boundary is the original\nsupermembrane world-volume:\n\u2202 W V 4 = W V3\n(8.10)\nand we circumvent the problem of solving eq.(8.8).\n31\n\n\fWith this observation we have concluded our proof that any AdS4 \u00d7G/H bosonic solution\nof M-theory field equations can be explicit gauge completed to a solution in a constrained\nsuperspace containing all the theta variables both associated with unbroken as with with\nbroken supersymmetries. Such a superspace extension is just suited for the pure spinor\naction of the M2 brane as derived in [4].\n\n9\n\nConclusions\n\nThe problem addressed in this paper is the supergauge completion of M-theory backgrounds\nof the form AdS4 \u00d7 (G/H). In short this corresponds to deriving an explicit parametrization\nof the p-forms of M-theory FDA in terms of all 32 fermionic coordinates plus the 11 bosonic\ncoordinates of the 7 manifold associated with the chosen manifold AdS4 \u00d7 (G/H). The\nmain motivation of solving such a problem is that the searched parametrization provides the\nnecessary information in order to convert the general pure spinor action of the M2 brane\nderived in [4] into an explicit form.\nOur solution is based on three ingredients: 1) identification of the obstruction which\nbreaks supersymmetry in the non-trivial curvature of an SO(8) connection U over the\nspinor bundle of the internal manifold G/H; 2) the replacement of Osp(8|4) Maurer-Cartan\nforms with their gauged counterparts by means of the U -connection; 3) the implementation of a quadratic constraint on the \u03b8 coordinates which in particular admits the solvable\nparametrization of supercoset manifold previously discussed in [11].\nIt is rather straightforward that the same ingredients can be used for superstrings in\nthe less-supersymmetric backgounds of AdS-type. We leave this subject to a forthcoming\npublication. Nevertheless, in the pure spinor formulation, one needs to BRST transform the\nconstraints (5.55) into constraints for the pure spinors. We notice that by solving (5.55)\nwe select a set of independent \u03b8's. Their BRST variation provides a set of unconstrained\ncommuting spinors on which we can still impose the pure spinor constraints. In this way we\nmaintain the balance of degrees of freedom needed to cancel the conformal central charge. As\na last remark, we point out that the target space supersymmetry is realized in a non-linear\nway and therefore the theory will be manifestly supersymmetric.

Furthermore we have tried to incorporate consistently into our framework the index conventions\nadopted in the series of papers ([29, 44, 23, 26, 32, 33, 34]), dating back to the eighties\nand relative to the classification and construction of Freund Rubin compactifications and\nreadopted in the series of papers ([40, 41, 42, 43, 49]) relative to the reinterpretation of such\nsolutions into the context of the AdS/CF T correspondence.\n1. The underlined lower latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet a, b, c, . . . =\n0, 1, . . . , 10 run on eleven values and span the vector representation of the so(1, 10) Lie\nalgebra, namely the tangent Lie algebra of D = 11 M-theory.\n2. The lower latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet a, b, c, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 3 (without underlining) run on four values and span the vector representation of the so(1, 3)\nLie algebra, namely the tangent Lie algebra to the D = 4 space-time, specifically AdS4 .\n3. The lower case greek indices from the beginning of the alphabet \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, . . . = 1, . . . , 7\nrun on seven values and span the vector representation of the so(7) Lie algebra namely\nthe tangent Lie algebra to the internal seven manifold M7 .\n4. The capital latin indices A, B, C, . . . = 1, . . . , 8 from the beginning of the alphabet\nrun on eight values and span the vector representation of so(8). They enumerate the\nmembers of an orthonormal basis of sections {\u03b6A } of the spinor bundle on M7 .\n5. Slightly modifying the general conventions of papers [29, 29, 44, 26, 32, 34], the underlined capital latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet A, B, C, . . . run on N\nvalues and are the vector indices of the subgroup SO(N ) \u2282 Osp(N |4). They enumerate\nthe members of an orthonormal basis of Killing spinors \u03b7A .\n6. Hence we have in general:\na =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\na\n, |{z}\n\u03b1\n\uf8f3 |{z}\n\uf8fe\n4 values 7 values\n\n33\n\n\fA =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\nA\n,\nB\n|{z}\n|{z}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\nN values 8 -N values\n\n(A.1)\n\n7. The lower case latin indices from the end of the alphabet x, y, z, t, . . . take four values and are symplectic indices in the fundamental representation of sp(4, R). They\nenumerate the members \u03c7x of an orthonormal basis of Killing spinors on the manifold\nAdS4 .\n\nB\n\nSpinor identities\n\nIn this section we list some spinor identities which are very useful in deriving various results\ndiscussed in the main text.\n\nB.1\n\nD=7 gamma matrix basis and spinor identities\n\nWe begin by writing the explicit form of the \u03c4 matrices used in the Kaluza-Klein supergravity\nliterature [29] and in particular in the literature concerning the N010 manifold1 .\nThe Clifford algebra:\n{\u03c4\u03b1 , \u03c4\u03b2 } = \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n(B.1)\nis satisfied by the following, real, antisymmetric matrices:\n0\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\n@ 0\n\u22121\n\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\nB \u22121\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\n@ 0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB \u22121\n@ 0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c41\n\n=\n\n0\n\n\u03c43\n\n=\n\n0\n\n\u03c45\n\n1\n\n=\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\n0A\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0C\nC\n1C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\n0A\n0\n\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n1C\nC\n0C\n0A\n0\n\n;\n\n;\n\n\u03c42\n\n\u03c44\n\n=\n\n=\n\n0\n\n0\nB0\nB\nB1\nB\nB0\nB\nB0\nB\nB0\n@0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n0\nB0\nB\nB0\nB\nB0\nB\nB0\nB\nB0\n@1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\nB0\nB\nB0\nB\nB0\nB\nB1\nB\nB0\n@0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n;\n\n\u03c46\n\n=\n\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\n0A\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n1C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\n0A\n0\n\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n1C\n0A\n0\n\nNote that there is a change of basis with respect to the tau matrices used in paper [4]\n\n34\n\n\f0\nB 0\nB\nB 0\nB\nB \u22121\nB\nB 0\nB\nB 0\n@ 0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c47\n\n=\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n1\n0\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\nC\n0C\n1A\n0\n\n(B.2)\n\nLet \u03b6A be an orthonormal basis of section for the spinor bundle on M7 , namely:\n\u03b6 A \u03b6B = \u03b4AB\n\n(B.3)\n\nNow let QAB = \u2212QBA be any SO(8) Lie algebra valued 1-form and let us define the following\nobjects:\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b2\n\u0398\u03b1\n\u039e\u03b1\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\n\u03b6A \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b6B QAB\n\u03b6A \u03c4 \u03b1 \u03b6B QAB\n\u03b6A \u03c4 \u03b1 \u03b6B QAC \u2227 QCD\n\u03b6A \u03c4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b6B QAC \u2227 QCD\n\n(B.4)\n\nThen using the negative metric to saturate the so(7) vector indices, as it is appropriate in\nour conventions, we find the following identities:\n\u0001\n1\n\u2212 16\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 + 18 \u0398\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b6A = QAB \u03b6B\n\u2206\u03b1\u03b2 \u2227 \u0398\u03b2 = 4 \u039e\u03b1\n\u2212 \u2206\u03b1\u03b2 \u2227 \u2206\u03b2\u03b3 = \u22124 \u03a0\u03b1\u03b2 + \u0398\u03b1 \u2227 \u0398\u03b2\n\n(B.5)\n\nNext we consider the spinor identities in 4-dimensions.\n\nB.2\n\nD=4 \u03b3-matrix basis and spinor identities\n\nIn this section we construct a basis of so(1, 3) gamma matrices such that it explicitly realizes\nthe isomorphism so(2, 3) \u223c sp(4, R) with the conventions used in the main text.

To this effect we shall consider the spaces Q111 and N010 .\n\nC.1\n\nThe Q111 sasakian manifold\n\nThe 7 manifold Q111 is an S1 fibration over the product of three P1 :\n\u03c0\n\nQ111 =\u21d2 P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1\n\n(C.1)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nQ111 \u223c O P1 , 1 \u2297 O P1 , 1 \u2297 O P1 , 1\n\n(C.2)\n\nthe fibration being:\nThis means that, as a coset manifold, it can be described as the particular instance (p, q, r) =\n(1, 1, 1) in the infinite family of homogeneous spaces:\nSU(2)1 \u00d7 SU(2)2 \u00d7 SU(2)3 \u00d7 U(1)\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(1)\n3\n3\n3\nZ = p J(1) + q J(2)\n+ r J(2)\n+Y\n\nQpqr =\n\n(C.3)\n(C.4)\n\nby definition Z being the Cartan generator that is not in the subalgebra H = U(1) \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7\na\nU(1), J(i)\n(a = 1, 2, 3) being the generators of SU(2)i and the hypercharge Y being the\ngenerator of U(1) in the numerator group G.\nThese 7-manifolds were originally introduced in [50] and their role as solutions of D = 11\nsupergravity was there discussed. In particular their holonomy and Killing spinors were\ncalculated explicitly in [50], showing that for (p, q, r) = (1, 1, 1) there is so(8)-holonomy\nequal to su(3) and two Killing spinors, while in all the other cases all supersymmetries\nare broken. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the algebraic structure of the\nsasakian manifolds was shown to determine the form of the dual gauge theories in [42] and\n37\n\n\fin that paper the gauge dual of Q111 was also derived. Finally the complete Kaluza-Klein\nspectrum of M-theory on AdS4 \u00d7 Q111 and its organization in Osp(2|4) \u00d7 SU(2)3 multiplets\nwas derived in [51]. We review here the essential steps in the geometrical construction of\nQ111 in order to calculate the explicit form of the so(8) connection\nWe begin by writing the Maurer Cartan equations of the Lie algebra G = su(2) \u2295 su(2) \u2295\nsu(2)\u2295u(1), by enumerating its generators from one to ten, the first triplet e1 , e2 , e3 being the\ngenerators of the first su(2), the second triplet e4 , e5 , e6 the generators of the second su(2) and\nso on. The last generator e10 is associated with the abelian u(1) algebra. Correspondingly\nwe have:\n\uf8fc\n0 = de1+3i + e2+3i \u2227 e3+3i \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\ni = 0, 1, 2\n0 = de2+3i \u2212 e1+3i \u2227 e3+3i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n0 = de\n+e\n\u2227e\n3+3i\n\n1+3i\n\n2+3i\n\n0 = de10\n\n(C.5)\n\nNext we perform a change of basis in the above 10-dimensional algebra introducing the\nfollowing new set of 1-forms:\n\u221a1 e\n4 2e 1\n\u221a1 e\n4 2e 4\n\u221a1 e\n4 2e 7\n\n\u03a31 =\n\u03a33 =\n\u03a35 =\n\u03a37 =\n\u03a38 =\n\u03a39 =\n\u03a310 =\n\n; \u03a32 =\n; \u03a34 =\n; \u03a36 =\n\n\u221a1 e\n4 2e 2\n\u221a1 e\n4 2e 5\n\u221a1 e\n4 2e 8\n\n1\n(e3 + e6 + e9 + e10 )\n8e\n1\n(e3 \u2212 e6 \u2212 e9 + e10 )\n2\n1\n(\u2212 e3 + e6 \u2212 e9 + e10 )\n2\n1\n(\u2212 e3 \u2212 e6 + e9 + e10 )\n2\n\n(C.6)\n\nThe meaning of the above rearrangement is the following. Apart from the rescaling by the\nfactor 4\u221a12 e the first six generators are, two by two, the vielbeins of the three copies of the\n2-dimensional projective space P1 \u223c SU(2)/U(1). The last four generators correspond to\nan orthogonal basis in the space spanned by the four Cartan generators, such that the first\nelement in the basis is dual to the generator Z of eq.(C.4) with p = q = r = 1. In this way\n\u03a37 can be identified as the 7th-vielbein of Q111 . The remaining three 1-forms \u03a38,9,10 provide\na basis for the H-subalgebra H = u(1) \u2295 u(1) \u2295 u(1). The rescalings of the vielbeins have\nbeing chosen in such a way as to produce a diagonal Ricci tensor with 7-eigenvalues all equal\nto 12e2 as it is required in order for the manifold to be a solution of D = 11 supergravity.\nHere as above e denotes the Freund Rubin parameter.\nWriting the Maurer Cartan equations (C.5) in the new basis the Maurer Cartan equations\n(C.5) we can use them to calculate the spin connection B \u03b1\u03b2 of the 7-manifold by setting:\nB \u03b1 = {\u03a31 , . . . \u03a37 }\n\n(C.7)\n\nand implementing the vanishing of the torsion:\ndB \u03b1 + B \u03b1\u03b2 \u2227 B \u03b2 = 0\n38\n\n(C.8)\n\n\fThis leads to the calculation of the Riemann tensor and of the Ricci tensor:\nR\u03b1\u03b2 = 12e2 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1\n\n(C.9)\n\nas required.\nThe connection on the so(8)-bundle can now be easily calculated. From its definition:\nU = \u2212 14 B \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 e B \u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\n\n(C.10)\n\nwe can obtain its explicit form, provided we use an explicit representation of the \u03c4 -matrices,\nsatisfying the Clifford algebra (B.1). In appendix B.1 we displayed an explicit realization of\nthe \u03c4 matrices which is well adapted to the discussion of the N010 manifold and is particularly\nsimple. Certainly we could use such a basis also for the Q111 -manifold, yet, in this case it is\nconvenient to use another basis \u03c4\u03b10 , related to the \u03c4\u03b1 of eq.s(B.2) by an orthogonal SO(8)\ntransformation:\n\u03c4\u03b10 = O \u03c4\u03b1 OT\n(C.11)\nwhere:\n\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec 21\n\uf8ec 1\n\uf8ec 2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\nO = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 21\n\uf8ec 1\n\uf8ec \u221a\n\uf8ec2 2\n\uf8ed 0\n2\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n\u2212 21\n0\n0\n\n0\n\u2212 12\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n2\n1\n2\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n0\n\u2212 12\n\n0\n2\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n2\n\n\u2212 12\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n\u2212 12\n0\n0\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n2 \uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u22121\n\u221a \uf8f7\n2 2\uf8f7\n1 \uf8f8\n\n\u2212 12\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\u2212 12\n1\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n2\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u221a\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\u221a\n\n(C.12)\n\n2\n\nIf the \u03c4\u03b1 used in eq.(C.10) are the \u03c4\u03b10 , defined in eq.(C.12), we get a block-diagonal structure\nfor the U-matrix:\n!\nU2 0\nU =\n(C.13)\n0 U6\nwhere:\n\u0012\nso(2) 3 U2 =\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\u03a38\n\u2212e \u03a37 \u2212 4 \u2212 \u03a349 \u2212\n!\n0\ne10\n\u2212e10\n\ne \u03a37 +\n\u03a310\n4\n\n\u03a38\n4\n\n+\n0\n\n\u03a39\n4\n\n+\n\n\u03a310\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n(C.14)\n\n0\n\nand\n\uf8eb\n\nso(6) 3 U6\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec e\u221a4\n\uf8ec 2 2\n\uf8ec \u2212e\n\u221a5\n\uf8ec\n2\n= \uf8ec \u2212e27 +e\n8\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec e3 \u2212e46 \u2212e9\n\uf8ed\n2\ne7 +e8\n4\n\n\u2212e\n\u221a4\n2 2\n\n0\n\ne\u221a\n5\n2 2\ne3 +e6 \u2212e9\n2\n\n\u2212e3 \u2212e6 +e9\n2\n\u2212e1 \u2212e2\n4\ne\u221a\n5\n2 2\n\u2212e1 +e2\n4\n\n0\n\ne7 \u2212e8\n4\ne1 +e2\n4\ne1 \u2212e2\n4\n\n\u2212e1 +e2\n4\ne\u221a\n4\n2 2\ne1 +e2\n4\n\n\u2212e7 \u2212e8\n4\n\u2212e3 +e6 \u2212e9\n2\n\n0\n\n\u2212e3 +e6 +e9\n2\n\u2212e\n\u221a5\n2 2\n\u2212e\n\u221a4\n2 2\ne7 +e8\n4\n\n0\n\n\u2212e7 \u2212e8\n4\ne1 \u2212e2\n4\n\u2212e1 \u2212e2\n4\ne3 \u2212e6 +e9\n2\n\u2212e7 +e8\n4\n\ne7 \u2212e8\n4\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n(C.15)\n\n39\n\n\fC.2\n\nThe N010 tri-sasakian manifold\n\nThe space N010 can be simply defined as the coset space\nS\nSU(3)\n=\n,\nR\nU(1)\n\n(C.16)\n\nwhere, using the Gell-Mann matrices \u03bbA as su(3) generators, the quotient is taken with\nrespect to the U(1) subgroup generated by \u03bb8 . The space N010 , an instance in the series of 7dimensional coset spaces named N p,q,r in the classification of [34], is the only 7-dimensional\ncoset that, when used as a compactification manifold for 11D supergravity, can preserve\nN = 3 supersymmetry [52]. The complete KK spectrum of the N010 compactification was\nderived in [49], and its Osp(3|4) multiplet structure elucidated in [41, 53].\nThe isotropy group of N010 is SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2); the SU(2) factor is the normalizer of the\nU(1) action and, explicitly, it is generated by \u03bb1,2,3 .\nIn this case the underlined capital latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet run\non eight values and span the adjoint representation of the su(3) Lie algebra.\nLet\n(C.17)\n\u03a3A = (\u03a3\u03b1 , \u03a38 )\nbe the Maurer-Cartan forms for su(3), namely let\n\u03a3 = 2i \u03a3A \u03bbA = g \u22121 dg\n\n;\n\ng \u2208 SU(3)\n\n(C.18)\n\nso that the Maurer Cartan equations\nd\u03a3 + \u03a3 \u2227 \u03a3 = 0\n\n(C.19)\n\nrewritten in the Gell-Mann basis:\nd\u03a3A +\n\n1\n2\n\nf ABC \u03a3B \u2227 \u03a3C = 0\n\n(C.20)\n\ndefine the structure constants f ABC of the su(3) Lie algebra. The vielbein corresponding\nto a generic SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)-invariant metric are obtained from the coset vielbein \u03a3\u03b1 (\u03b1 =\n1, . . . 7) by rescaling independently the two groups associated to \u03bb\u03b1\u0307 (\u03b1\u0307 = 1, 2, 3) and \u03bb\u03b1e\n(e\n\u03b1 = 4, 5, 6, 7). Indeed such a decomposition is respected both by the U(1) quotient and by\nthe SU(2) action. Thus we have2 :\nB \u03b1 = (\u03b1\u22121 \u03a3\u03b1\u0307 , \u03b2 \u22121 \u03a3\u03b1e ) .\n\n(C.21)\n\nThe spin connection B \u03b1\u03b2 and the curvature associated to these vielbein are straightforwardly\ncomputed (see [54]).\nThe \"standard\" N010 metric is obtained with the following rescalings:\n\u221a\n\u03b1 = \u22124 e , \u03b2 = \u00b14 2 e .\n(C.22)\n2\n\nDue to a different choice of structure constant, our rescaling \u03b1 is minus twice the one used in [54].\n\n40\n\n\fIt preserves N = 3 supersymmetry. It is known [52] that, when N010 is realized as the coset\n(C.16), its Killing spinors must actually be constant. With the rescalings (C.22), there are\n3 independent constant spinors \u03b7 A (A = 1, 2, 3) that satisfy eq. (3.31), namely\n1\n\u2212 B \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b7 A = e \u03c4\u03b3 \u03b7 A .\n4\n\n(C.23)\n\nThey transform as a triplet under the SU(2) part of the isometry, which therefore truly\nacquires the role of the R-symmetry group SU(2)R for the 4-dimensional gauged supergravity\nthat arises from the compactification.\nThere is a possible solution that differs from (C.22) only by the sign of the rescaling \u03b1.\nWhile the sign of \u03b2 is irrelevant, because \u03b2 appears quadratically also in the spin connection,\nreversing the sign of \u03b1 amounts to reversing the sign of the spin connection (or, equivalently,\nto changing the orientation of the manifold). This solution with opposite orientation preserves no supersymmetry.\nIn the case with preserved N = 3 supersymmetry let us calculate the so(8) connection\nas defined by eq.(4.5):\n1\nU SO(8) \u2261 \u2212 B \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 e \u03c4\u03b3 B \u03b3\n(C.24)\n4\nWe find its explicit expression as an 8 \u00d7 8 matrix:\nUSO(8) =\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 0\n\n0\n\n4 B5\n\n\u22124 B 4\n\u2212( 3 \u03a38 )\n+ 2 B3\n2\n\n\u22124 B 7\n\n4 B6\n\n\u22122 B 2\n\n\u22122 B 1\n\n0\n\n2 B1\n\n\u22122 B 2\n\u2212( 3 \u03a38 )\n\u2212 2 B3\n2\n\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0\n\n0 0 \u22124 B 5\n0 0\n\n4 B4\n\n0 0\n\n4 B7\n\n0 0 \u22124 B\n0 0\n\n0\n\n\u221a\n\n0\n3 \u03a38\n2\n\n\u2212 2 B3\n\n2 B2\n6\n\n2B\n0\n\n1\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22122 B 1\n2B\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u221a\n\n0\n3 \u03a38\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n+ 2 B3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(C.25)\nwhere B \u03b1 is the vielbein defined with the appropriate rescalings already included and \u03a38\nis the H-connection, namely the component along \u03bb8 of the left-invariant 1-form \u03a3 on the\ncoset.\nIt is visually evident from eq.(C.25) that the three Killing spinors are\n\u03b71 = (1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n\u03b72 = (0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n\n(C.26)\n\n\u03b73 = (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1)\nSince the non trivial part of the operator USO(8) is only the block in the five directions\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n41\n\n\fHence, in this case, we have a natural way of introducing an orthogonal basis of sections\nof the so(8) spinor bundle.
