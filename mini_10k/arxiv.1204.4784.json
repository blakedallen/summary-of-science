Protein misfolding diseases are a well-known class of ailments including\nAlzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. They all involve protein aggregation and share common\nfeatures such as the presence of insoluble fibrous protein aggregation in a specific structural motif\ncharacterized by a cross-\u03b2 sheet structure.2 Key issues on aggregation are not yet fully addressed such as the\ndetailed microscopic mechanism leading to aggregation, the structure of aggregates, how the environmental\nconditions can affect the rate and the amount of aggregation and how aggregation can be prevented and/or\nremoved.\nAdditives may promote the stabilization of the native state of the protein accelerating the kinetics of the\ncorrect folding and removing/inhibiting the aggregation of denatured polypeptides and intermediates of the\nfolding pathways.3\nIn recent years ionic liquids (ILs) have been used to stabilize the protein activity, to inhibit or reduce\naggregation, and to improve the in vitro refolding of denatured proteins.4,5 ILs have numerous attractive\ncharacteristics including their non-volatility, good solvating properties, thermal stability, and recyclability,\nthat render these compounds \"environmentally green\".6,7,8,9,10 One of the most important qualities of these\nsolvents is the high tunability of their chemical structure. Indeed, they can be designed to have specific\nphysical and chemical qualities by acting on either the alkyl chains (i.e. modifying the length, the presence of\nhydrophobic groups, etc.) or the anion (i.e. varying the degree of the charge delocalization, its hydrogen\nbonding ability, etc).11 ILs having coordinating anions which are strong hydrogen bond acceptors (e.g. Cl \u2212,\nNO3\u2212, CH3COO\u2212 and (MeO)2PO2\u2212) can dissolve many compounds which are insoluble or sparingly soluble\nin water and in most of the organic solvents. Examples include cellulose12 and several compounds having\nspecific pharmacological activity.13,14,15 As to the effects of the cation alkyl chain length, it has been\nproposed that the polarity of ILs decreases with increasing the alkyl chain length.10 This can be an important\nchemical parameter as the polarity of ILs have an impact on the enzyme stability and selectivity. In particular\nthe lengthening of the alkyl chain seems to have a positive effect on dissolving the aggregates and a negative\neffect on refolding the protein.16,17,18,19\nIn the last years the effects of ILs on several proteins have been extensively investigated by varying ILs\n\n\fFigure 1 - Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL). N terminal and C terminal are labeled. The aromatic residues that were discussed in\nthe text are highlighted: Phe (red), Tyr (green), Trp (blue). Among Cysteine residues (yellow) the disulphide bridges take place.\nTyr53, Trp62, Trp63 and Trp108 are in the active site of the enzyme.\n\ncomposition (anion, cation, and alkyl chains) and denaturing conditions up to fibrillar aggregates. 20,21,22\nMany interesting studies on the ILs-protein interaction have been carried out on lysozyme (Fig. 1), an\nenzyme often used as a model protein to study fibril formation in vitro.23,24 As a matter of fact this protein\ncan be easily converted to amyloid fibrils under high temperature and low pH environmental conditions and\nthe fibrils formed share similar characteristics to ailment's amyloid.25 Recently N. Byrne and C.A. Angell26\nhave found that a protic IL (PIL), namely ethyl ammonium nitrate (EAN), has the property of partly\nrecovering lysozyme functionality also after severe denaturing procedures leading to fibrils formation. This\nis a particularly interesting finding since it is rather uncommon to find an additive able to dissolve aggregates\nand contemporary to refold, at least partly, the protein. We want to stress that in ref. 26, as well as in most of\nthe relevant literature, the enzymatic activity and the amount of protein aggregates have been exploited as a\nmeasure of the ILs ability as a refolding enhancers and aggregation inhibitor. A specific analysis of the\nstructural rearrangements induced by the ILs interaction is therefore lacking in most cases.\nIn the last decades Raman spectroscopy has become a common practice in protein structural investigations.\nThis technique has many advantages: it is a non-destructive and non-invasive technique and it requires small\namount of sample. Moreover, reliable assignments between specific spectral features and local protein\nstructures have been established, and clear, sensitive spectroscopic markers of the secondary structure 27 and\nof the side-chain environments28 have been identified. A careful data analysis of Raman spectra can also\nprovide direct information on the protein tertiary structure (e.g. on disulphide bridges 29 and hydrogen bonds\nof the side chains30). The analysis of the amide bands is almost routinely exploited for the empiricalquantitative estimate of the protein secondary structure31 with an accuracy comparable with that obtainable\nfrom circular dichroism experiments as witnessed by the good agreement usually found with the analysis of\nX-ray structural data.32\nIn the present paper we report on a careful Raman study of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) in both native\nand fibrillar conformations as well as on several PILs treated fibrillar HEWL. This study allowed us to get a\nfull spectroscopic characterization of the protein in the two extreme conformations and, by comparison, to\nevaluate the refolding efficiency of EAN and of many other PILs of the same class of ammonium based\nPILs. Taking full advantage of the potentiality of the Raman spectroscopy as a structural diagnostic tool, we\nwere able to confirm the capability of EAN as a refolding enhancer (see ref. 26) and, in addition, to achieve a\ndeeper insight of the EAN induced structural modifications of lysozyme. The relevance of the alkyl chain\nlength on the refolding efficiency of the different PILs investigated is finally briefly discussed.\n\n\fExperimental\nMaterials\nHen egg white lysozyme powder was purchased from Fluka (62970) and used without further purification.\nHEWL fibrils were prepared by following a thermo-chemical protocol.33A quantity of 14 mg of HEWL were\ndissolved in 1 ml of distilled, purified water and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 by adding HCl. The\ntemperature was then gradually increased with a rate of 10\u00b0C / 1h up to 72\u00b0C and the solution was kept at\nthis temperature for 6 days.\nThe PILs used in the present work are based on the nitrate anion, NO3-.34,35,36 Their typical formula is\nschematically depicted in Fig. 2, while their complete formulas are reported in Table 1. EAN and PAN were\nacquired from IoLiTec (Ionic Liquids Technologies), while BAN and MEOAN were synthesized in house.\nFollowing ref. 26 weighted samples (1 mg) of HEWL fibrils were placed in vials and an aliquot (1 ml) of\nPILs were added. After 20 minutes at ambient conditions the solutions were centrifuged for 3 minutes,\ndecanted and washed for 3 times. Finally samples were dried to be measured by Raman spectroscopy.\n\nFigure 2 - General formula of the four PILs\nused in this work.\n\nTable 1 - Names, acronyms and complete chemical formulas of\nthe four PILs used in this work.\n\nMethods\nRaman measurements were carried out using a confocal micro-Raman spectrometer by Jobin-Yvon,\nequipped with several objectives, a 20 mW He\u2013Ne laser (632.8 nm wavelength), and a 1800 lines mm\u22121\ngrating. Raman spectra were collected in the back-scattering geometry and a notch filter was used to reject\nthe elastic contribution, thus preventing also the collection of spectra close to the excitation line. Raman\nspectra were collected by means of a Peltier-cooled CCD (charge coupled device). Measurements were\nperformed separately over four spectral ranges to cover the 200-3600 cm-1 wavenumber region with a\nresolution better than 3 cm\u22121. A large confocal diaphragm of 400 \u03bcm has been used in order to obtain a good\nRaman signal. The absolute wavenumber calibration for each spectral range was obtained by collecting the\nemission lines of a neon lamp. Further experimental details can be found in ref. 37.\nPreliminary measurements on the protein powder placed onto a quartz slide were performed using available\nfilters and objectives to find the best experimental conditions. Sample homogeneity and the absence of\npolarization effects were proved by repeating measurements on different sample regions. The typical\nacquisition time was 10 minutes for each frequency range. As a reference the Raman spectra of the PILs\nwere collected in a quartz cuvette (1mm of optical path) after being de-hydrated in controlled atmosphere\nunder nitrogen flux.\nAll the spectra were fitted using Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm (LM algorithm) and\nLorentzian-Gaussian pseudo-Voigt functions as peak profiles.38,39,40,41\n\nResults and Discussion\nRaman Spectra of Native and Fibrillar Lysozyme\nBefore discussing our spectroscopic data we want to recall that protein fibrillation pathway starts with the\ndestabilization and partial unfolding of the native protein induced by high temperature and low pH\nenvironment. Partial unfolded proteins are converted into intermediates oligomers which subsequently are\n\n\fturned into protofibrils and finally into amyloids.42 The sequence of these structural transitions can be\nmonitored by Raman spectroscopy which allows to follow the protein tertiary structure by means of the\nskeletal bending and the C-C-N stretching frequencies of the peptide backbone, and by the S-S and the C-S\nstretching frequencies of the disulphide bonds. The spectra of native powder and fibrillar HEWL shown in\nFig. 3 reveal indeed remarkable differences. The peaks ascribed to the S-S stretching vibrations between\n500-550 cm-1 (\u03c5(S-S) in Fig. 3) are still present after the thermo-chemical process, even if their shapes are\nclearly modified. The correlation between the band frequencies and the conformers of the disulfide bonds\n\nFigure 3 - Raman spectra of HEWL in native and fibrillar conformations. The region of CH stretching mode is shown in the inset.\nThe spectra were normalized in the frequency region of the Phe and Trp2 peaks (990-1025 cm-1).\n\nhas been well established through normal coordinate analysis and extensive experimental investigation.43,44\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the four S-S bridges in native lysozyme give rise to three Raman bands at 507, 526 and\n540 cm-1 indicating that the intra-molecular S-S bonds in native lysozyme are in GGG, GGT and TGT\nconformations,45 in agreement with the results of Van Wart et al.29 After fibril formation, the intensities of\n\u03c5(S-S) vibrations near 530 and 540 cm-1 disappeared, clearly indicating a distortion of the dihedral angles\nwith respect to the native structure.\nOn the other side, the C-C-N stretching peaks are centered around 930 cm-1 when the protein structure is\nmainly \u03b1 helix and at higher frequencies (around 960-980 cm-1) when it is mainly in a \u03b2 sheet conformation\n(see the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 3).46,47 A close inspection of Fig. 3 clearly reveals that the band\nintensities ascribed to \u03b1 helix and a \u03b2 sheet conformations are markedly unbalanced towards the \u03b2 structure\non going from the native to the fibrillar protein.\nAn in-depth analysis of the Raman spectra allows to monitor the environment experienced by side chains\nand, consequently, to get information on the protein folding. This is the case of the analysis of the relative\nintensities of the peaks forming the Fermi doublets48 arising from Tyr (830-850 cm-1) and Trp residues\n(1340-1360 cm-1) clearly detectable in the Raman spectra of both native and fibrillar HEWL (Tyr1 and Trp3\nin Fig. 3, respectively).30,49\nThe peak intensity ratio I850/I830 of Tyr1 is a sensible marker of the hydrogen bonding of the Tyr phenoxyl\ngroup. If the ratio is around 0.3 the phenolic hydroxyl is the proton donor in a strong hydrogen bond, if\nI850/I830 is around 1.3 then the phenolic oxygen is both an acceptor and a donor of a weak hydrogen bond, and\nif the ratio is around 2.5 then the phenolic oxygen is the acceptor of a strong hydrogen bond.50 A decrease of\nI850/I830 ratio reflect an increase buriedness, while a ratio around 1.3 is typical of a solvent exposed residues.\nThe analysis of our data shows I850/I830\uf0401.3 for the native sample accordingly with a conformation where Tyr\nresidues are exposed and able to participate in moderate or weak hydrogen bonding. 51 After the thermochemical treatment the ratio exceeds 2.0 suggesting the onset of strong hydrogen bonds and a conformation\nwith Tyr more exposed to the solvent. This can be seen as a further spectroscopic signature of the unfolding\n\n\fprocess occurred after the thermo-chemical treatment.52,53 It is worth to notice that the displacement of Tyr\nside chains in lysozyme during the unfolding of the tertiary structure can be strictly related to a change in the\nactivity of the enzyme. Indeed, Tyr53 (see Fig. 1) is hydrogen bonded with the amino acid group of Asp66\nand it is adjacent to the catalytic residue Asp52. A change of the Tyr53 position could thus affect the\nenzymatic active site of lysozyme.54\nThe peak intensity ratio I1360/I1340 of the Trp3 doublet is a marker of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic\nenvironment of the Trp indole ring.55 If the relative intensity ratio I1360/I1340 is smaller than 1.0, the indole\nring is considered to be in a hydrophilic environment (or exposed to aqueous medium) whereas if the ratio is\ngreater than 1.0, it is considered to be in a hydrophobic environment (or in contact with aliphatic side\nchains). The analysis of the present measurements provides for the I1360/I1340 ratio the values of 0.4 for the\nnative and 2.5 for the fibrillar sample. The Trp side chains thus pass from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic\nenvironment on going from native to fibrillar state.\nChanges in the Raman spectra in the regions of Trp residues are of great importance because 3 of the 6 Trp\nresidues (Trp62, Trp63 and Trp108, see Fig. 1) are in the active site of the enzyme, 56 thus changes in their\nenvironment should play an important role in the enzymatic activity. Other important information on\nlysozyme environment and structure can be obtained analyzing the other bands associated with the Trp\nresidues at 1550 and 1011 cm-1 (Trp4 and Trp2 in Fig. 3). The latter shows a frequency shift from 1011 cm-1\n(native) to 1008 cm-1 (fibrillar)57 although, in this case, the conspicuous redistribution of the spectral\nintensities between the Trp2 and the close Phe peaks (~ 1003 cm-1) is the most remarkable effect. This\nfinding can be ascribed to a decrease of the intensity of the Phe peak rather than to an increase of the Trp2\npeak thus suggesting a larger exposure of Phe residue to the solvent after the thermal treatment.58\nHEWL is a globular protein consisting of approximately 40-45% of \u03b1 helix and around 20% of \u03b2 sheets in\nits native conformation.59 Since it is well known that different secondary structures give rise to different\ncomponents in the Raman amide bands,60 a standard analysis was carried out to obtain quantitative\ninformation on the secondary structures of HEWL. The results of the LM fitting procedure of the amide I\nband for the native structure are in good agreement with the literature values61 and are reported together with\nthose obtained for the fibrillar sample in Table 2 (the spectral deconvolution of the amide band of the\nuntreated fibrillar sample is shown in the following section in Fig. 5A). For the secondary structure\ncharacterization, since we are mainly interested in the \u03b1 helix and \u03b2 sheet contributions, we categorize the\nrest of the protein conformations as unordered structures. The fibrillation process decreases the \u03b1 helix and\nincreases the \u03b2 components. It has been previously reported that the random component of the secondary\nstructure plays a relevant role in the fibrillation process, as in the first stage of the fibrillation the native\nstructure falls in a disordered structure and then develops into an organized \u03b2 inter-chain structure.62 It is\nimportant to recall that the peak at around 1670 cm-1 is the marker of ordered \u03b2 sheet structures in the\naggregated sample, and that this feature together with the narrowing of the amide I band are the most clear\nmarkers of fibril formation in the Raman spectra.63 Shifts at lower frequencies can be observed in the amide\nIII region coherently with the above mentioned changes in the secondary structure from \u03b1 helix (around 1300\ncm-1) toward ordered \u03b2 sheet (around 1230 cm-1) (see Fig. 3).39,64\n\nTable 2 - Results from the fitting procedure of the Amide I band of the HEWL sample in both native and fibrillar states.\n\n\fRaman Spectra of HEWL treated with PILs\n\nFigure 4 - A) Raman spectra of the HEWL in native and fibrillar conformation, and of the fibrillar sample treated with: EAN, PAN,\nBAN and MEOAN. B) Raman spectra of EAN, PAN, BAN and MEOAN.\n\nRaman spectra of fibrillar lysozyme after the treatment with PILs are shown in Fig. 4A together with the\nspectra of the protein in the native and in the pristine fibrillar conformation. The spectra of the four pure\nPILs are shown Fig. 4B where it can be noticed that the symmetric stretching mode of NO3- is largely the\nmost prominent spectral feature.65 Despite three successive centrifugations and re-dilutions in water, this\npeak is still present in the Raman spectra of the treated samples (see Fig. 4A). Nevertheless by comparing the\nspectra in Fig. 4A and 4B it is rather clear that the presence of a small amount of PIL in the treated samples\ndoes not significantly affect the Raman signal arising from lysozyme at least away from the frequency of\nNO3- stretching peak. In particular the Raman contribution originating from residual PIL can be safely\nneglected over the frequency regions where the most relevant lysozyme spectral markers are found. By\ncomparing the spectra of the treated samples in Fig. 4A with those collected from the protein in the fibrillar\nand the native conformations we can highlight and discuss the effects of the PILs different treatement.\nFrom a qualitative point of view the Raman spectra of PAN and BAN treated samples appear very similar to\nthe one collected from pristine fibrillar HEWL. In particular the \u03c5(S-S) vibration of the disulphide bonds is\nlacking of the highest frequency components, indicating the same disposition of the dihedral angle than the\nfibrillar sample, distorted with respect to the native structure. Similar conclusions can be drawn looking at\nthe intensity ratio found for the Tyr1 and Trp3 doublets. The values found for PAN and BAN treated samples\nshow indeed that Tyr experienced a strong hydrogen bonds (I850/I830 = 1.9,and 1.8) and that Trp are still in a\nhydrophobic environment (I1360/I1340 = 1.9 and 1.5) as well as in the pristine fibrillar sample (I850/I830.=2.1 and\nI1360/I1340 =2.5). Some differences with the pristine fibrillar sample can be found in the C-C-N stretching\npeak region where a broadening and an intensity reduction of the spectral structure around 977 cm-1 (\u03b2 anti\nparallel configuration) is observed in the two treated samples.46 These findings reflect slight changes in the\ntertiary structure and reveal an increased disorder in the \u03b2 structures of the treated samples (see also the\nquantitative analysis of the amide I band reported in the following).\nA similar peak broadening and intensity decrease can be observed in the spectrum of the MEOAN treated\nsample, albeit, in this case other spectral modifications are also evident from the comparison with the\nspectrum of the pristine fibrillar lysozyme. In particular MEOAN modifies the lysozyme tertiary structure\nmainly on Phe, Tyr and Trp residues. The interaction between MEOAN and the aromatic residues is indeed\nwell evidenced in the Raman spectra by the modifications of the frequencies, shapes, and intensities of the\n\n\fTable 3 - Result of the fitting procedure of the amide I band of the HEWL sample in both native and fibrillar states.\n\nFigure 5 - Raman spectra of the fibril HEWL (orange circles) and the fibril HEWL treated with EAN (red circles) fitted through the\nLMA (black line in both panels). In solid grey the different conformations of the amide I band are shown and in dashed grey are\nshown the Tyr2 and Phe contributions.\n\nTrp peaks at 757 cm-1 (Trp1), 1340/1360 cm-1 (Trp3), 1550 cm-1 (Trp4) and Tyr peaks at 830/850 cm-1 (Tyr1),\n1610 cm-1 (Tyr2). The frequency values here reported refer to the native conformation. To explain these\nchanges in the Raman spectra we hypothesize a cation-\u03c0 interaction between the NH+ cation of MEOAN and\nthe electrostatic negative charge of the aromatic ring of Phe, Tyr and Trp residues.66,67 MEOAN is the only\nPILs among those here studied that exhibits such a behavior, we can thus address this peculiar interaction to\nthe presence of an ether group in the alkyl chain which makes MEOAN more polar than the others. On the\nother hand this type of interaction is quite common in proteins[ref] and we have observed similar spectral\nmodifications in a sample of fibrillar insulin treated with MEOAN (data not shown). Moreover the Raman\nspectrum of the treated MEOAN lysozyme shows changes with respect to that of the pristine fibrillar sample\nalso in the peaks involved in the NH modes (see around 1317 and 1540 cm-1), reinforcing the hypothesis of a\ncation-\u03c0 interaction.\nAmong those presently investigated, EAN is the ionic liquid showing the most remarkable differences\nbetween the spectra collected from the EAN treated and the pristine fibrillar lysozyme. These changes are\nmostly compatible with a PIL induced refolding process. Looking at Fig. 4A, it can be noticed that the C-CN stretching mode, related to the \u03b2 anti parallel structure (around 977 cm-1) totally vanishes in the spectrum\nof the EAN treated sample closely resembling the spectrum of the native protein. Indications of the ongoing\nrefolding process can be also found looking at the Phe-Trp2 doublet just above 1000 cm-1. As it was already\nobserved before, the fibrillation process exposed even more the Phe residues to the solvent and this leads to a\ndecrease in the intensities of the Phe peaks in the Raman spectrum (see Fig. 4A). 33 Further indication can be\n\n\fFigure 6 - Schematics of HEWL conformations: (a) native, (b) fibrillar, (c) partially refolded after EAN treatment, and (d) average\nconfiguration after PAN, BAN, and MEOAN treatments. \u03b1 helices segments are in green, \u03b2 intra-chain in magenta, \u03b2 inter-chain in\nred, and unordered segments in blue.\n\nobtained by the analysis of the Raman spectra in the S-S stretching region and from the Tyr Fermi doublet.\nIn both cases the EAN treated sample resembles the native lysozyme. \u03c5(S-S) reveal a restoration of the\npristine dihedral angles, while the value of the Tyr1 I850/I830 ratio is 0.9, close to the native one and\ndisplaying a character in the hydrogen bond that is both donor and acceptor. Finally the value obtained by the\nanalysis of the ratio of the Trp3 Fermi doublet (I1360/I1340=0.9) shows a partial restore of the hydrophilic\nenvironment around the Trp residues, resembling what is for the native lysozyme. We also would like to\nnotice that the peak around 786 cm-1 (see Fig. 4A), albeit not clearly assigned, can be found in all the spectra\nbut the native and the EAN treated ones.\nLooking at Fig. 4A we notice that the amide I band is actually unaffected by any PILs treatments except\nfor the EAN which causes a detectable broadening the band: the FWHM (full width half maximum) goes\nfrom 25 cm-1 to 30 cm-1 after the EAN treatment of the fibrillar sample. As mentioned above, more\nquantitative information about the refolding process can be obtained by a careful shape analysis of the amide\nband. A standard band fitting procedure was indeed carried out for all the investigated samples. In Fig. 5 the\nbest fit curves obtained using the LM algorithm for the EAN treated and the pristine fibrillar samples are\ncompared with the experimental data. The different components used in the fitting procedure associated to\ndifferent secondary structures of the HEWL conformation are also shown. In Table 3 the percentages for the\nsecondary structures considered are reported. Also in this case the analysis shows the peculiarity of the EAN\ntreatment which apparently induces modification of the secondary structure of fibrillar HEWL different from\nthose induced by the other PILs. In particular, going from the fibrillar to the EAN treated sample the\npercentage of the \u03b1 helix grows (from 19% to 31%) and that of \u03b2 sheet inter-chain diminishes (from 39% to\n30 %). It is important to stress once more that the concomitant diminishing of the \u03b2 sheet inter-chain\nstructure and the broadening of the amide I band (see Fig. 5) in the EAN treated sample are clear signs of the\nongoing refolding process. The behavior of fibrillar lysozyme in EAN is in agreement with the recovery of\nthe enzymatic activity observed by Byrne et al. (ref. 26). Looking at Table 3 it is also important to notice\nthat, albeit weak, a systematic decrease of the unordered components simultaneous to the increase of the \u03b2\nsheet intra-chain trend can be observed going from PAN to BAN to MEOAN, i.e. actually on increasing the\nalkyl chain.\n\nConclusions\nWe reported on a complete Raman investigation of lysozyme in the native and fibrillar conformations. In\naddition to the standard shape analysis of the amide I band, the backbone deformation and the Fermi\n\n\fdoublets of Tyr and Trp were deeply analyzed thus obtaining a comprehensive spectral characterization of\nthe native and fibrillar lysozyme. This preliminary investigation provided us of the fundamental basis for an\nanalysis of the refolding effect of several PILs on fibrillar lysozyme. We indeed carried out a systematic\nRaman investigation of four PILs treated fibrillar lysozyme samples and through the comparison with the\nnative and the untreated fibrillar sample we were able to evaluate the refolding efficiency of the solvents.\nThe comparative spectral analysis shows that PAN and BAN (long chain PILs) only partially affect the\ntertiary structure of the fibrillar protein leaving the secondary structure actually untouched from the pristine\nfibrillar conformation. No evidences of a real refolding process have been found also in the fibrillar sample\ntreated with MEOAN (a long chain PIL with an ether group). In this case, likely due to the presence of the\nether group, we observed a clear indication of a different PIL-protein interaction mainly affecting the\naromatic residues. Our results show that only the treatment with EAN (the shortest chain PIL) induces a\nsignificant refolding of fibrillar lysozyme.\nSchematics of the protein conformations induced by the thermo-chemical and by the subsequent PIL\ntreatments are shown in Fig. 6.We notice that the fibrillar conformation (Fig.6b) is mainly characterized by a\nlarge extent of \u03b2 aggregates (\u03b2 inter-chain, red segment) which, according with the results of the quantitative\nanalysis of the secondary structure (amide band), is significantly reduced by the EAN treatment (Fig. 6c).\nThis progress towards the native conformation (Fig.6a) induced by the EAN treatment is accompanied by the\nrefolding of several protein structures (blue and green segments in Fig.6c) consistently with the indications\nobtained from several spectroscopic markers related to specific residues. In particular Tyr and Phe during the\nfibrillation process are more exposed to the solvent, while Trp changes its state from an exposed state in the\nnative conformation to a buried state in the fibrillar. The EAN treatment report all the residues to their\npristine conformations: Tyr and Phe are found to be less exposed to the solvent, while Trp residues goes back\nto the exposed state typical of a native conformation. These changes are particularly relevant since Tyr53,\nTrp62, Trp63 and Trp108 are in the lysozyme active site and have an important role in its enzymatic\nactivity.54,56 This result is fair good agreement with the recovery of the lysozyme functionality reported in\nref. 26.\nTreatments with long chain PILs (PAN, BAN, and MEOAN) do not drive fibrillar lysozyme toward the\nnative conformation but, on the contrary, they increase the percentage of \u03b2 intra-chain (magenta segments)\nwith respect to both fibrillar and native conformations. Generally speaking the interaction with long chain\nPILs leads to a protein conformation markedly \u03b2 (over 70% on average) far away from the mainly \u03b1 helix\nstructure of the native protein (45% \u03b1 and 23% \u03b2) but also from the fibrillar (~ 60% \u03b2).We want to stress\nthat the analysis of the spectroscopic markers related to Trp, Tyr and Phe residues shows that they are still in\nthe fibrillar conformation thus preventing any recovery of the enzymatic activity.\nThe possibility offered by the Raman spectroscopy to gain a deeper insight into the structural modifications\ninduced by refolding additives opens the way to a systematic use of Raman spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool\nin refolding studies, especially in determining the efficiency of IL-based additives for protein refolding.\nOn concluding, in the most recent literature it is widely accepted that the lengthening of the alkyl chain\nfavors aggregate dissolution and inhibits protein refolding. Indeed, our results show a significant dependence\nof the PIL refolding enhancer properties from the cation structure, but the long alkyl chain compounds\nweakly affect the ordered \u03b2 aggregates, peculiar of the fibrils conformation, thus preventing any conversion\nof the \u03b2 sheets into \u03b1 helices. On the contrary the shortest alkyl chain compound (EAN) is able to induce\nboth the fibril melting and the refolding of the secondary structure. The information obtained by our analysis\nsurely help in understanding the microscopic mechanism at the origin of the lysozyme functionality\nrecovery.\n\nAcknowledgment\nL.G. acknowledges support from FIRB \"Futuro in Ricerca\" research project RBFR086BOQ_001, \"Structure\nand dynamics of ionic liquids\".\n\n\fReferences\n1\n\nH.-C.
