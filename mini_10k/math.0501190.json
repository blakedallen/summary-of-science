HARVEY\u2020\n\nAbstract. We investigate the behavior of the higher-order degrees, \u03b4\u0304n , of a\nfinitely presented group G. These \u03b4\u0304n are functions from H 1 (G; Z) to Z whose\nvalues are the degrees certain higher-order Alexander polynomials. We show\nthat if def(G) \u2265 1 or G is the fundamental group of a compact, orientable 3manifold then \u03b4\u0304n is a monotonically increasing function of n for n \u2265 1. This is\nfalse for general groups. As a consequence, we show that if a 4-manifold of the\nform X \u00d7 S 1 admits a symplectic structure then X \"looks algebraically like\" a\n3-manifold that fibers over S 1 , supporting a positive answer to a question of\nTaubes. This generalizes a theorem of S. Vidussi [V2] and is an improvement on\nthe results in [Ha1]. We also find new conditions on a 3-manifold X which will\nguarantee that the Thurston norm of f \u2217 (\u03c8), for \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z) and f : Y \u2192 X\na surjective map on \u03c01 , will be at least as large the Thurston norm of \u03c8. When\nX and Y are knot complements, this gives a partial answer to a question of J.\nSimon.\nMore generally, we define \u0393-degrees, \u03b4\u0304\u0393 , corresponding to a surjective map\nG \u0589 \u0393 for which \u0393 is poly-torsion-free-abelian. Under certain conditions, we\nshow they satisfy a monotonicity condition if one varies the group. As a result,\nwe show that these generalized degrees give obstructions to the deficiency of a\ngroup being positive and obstructions to a finitely presented group being the\nfundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold.\n\nIn [Ha1], we defined some new invariants \u03b4\u0304n for a finite CW-complex X. These\ninvariants depended only on the fundamental group of X and measured the \"size\"\nof the successive quotients of the rational derived series of \u03c01 (X). Given X and a\ncohomology class \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X), \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) was defined to be the degree of a \"higher-order\nAlexander polynomial.\" Although defined algebraically, these degrees have many\ntopological applications in the case that X is a 3-manifold. In this case, we showed\nthat the \u03b4\u0304n give new estimates for the Thurston norm of a 3-manifold generalizing a theorem of C. McMullen [Mc]. Recall that the Thurston norm of a class\n\u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z), ||\u03c8||T , is defined to be the minimum negative euler characteristic\nof all (possibly disconnected) surfaces F whose homology class [F ] \u2208 H2 (X, \u2202X; Z)\nis Poincare dual to \u03c8 and such that each component of F is non-positively curved.\nThe \u03b4\u0304n also give new algebraic obstructions to a 3-manifold fibering over S 1 , to a\n4-manifold of the form X \u00d7S 1 admitting a symplectic structure, and to a 3-manifold\nbeing Seifert fibered. They were also shown to have applications to minimal ropelength and genera of knots and links in S 3 . Related work has been done by T.\nCochran, K. Orr, P. Teichner, for knots and knot concordance in [C] and [COT].\nRecently, V. Turaev [T] has generalized some of the results in [Ha1].\nSince \u03b4\u0304n only depends on the fundamental group, we can consider \u03b4\u0304n as an\ninvariant of a general group G, \u03b4\u0304n : H 1 (G; Z) \u2192 Z. In this paper, we continue to\n\u2020 The\n\nauthor was partially supported by an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\ninvestigate the special behavior of the \u03b4\u0304n when G is the fundamental group of a\n3-manifold (with empty or toroidal boundary) or a group with deficiency at least\n1. The results give new algebraic information about the topology of a symplectic\n4-manifolds of the form X \u00d7 S 1 . They give obstructions to a finitely presented\ngroup having positive deficiency or being the fundamental group of a compact,\norientable 3-manifold (with or without boundary). They also give new information\nabout the behavior of the Thurston norm under a map between 3-manifolds which\nis surjective on \u03c01 . We state some of our main theorems and their applications\nbelow.\nIn [Ha1], we constructed examples of 3-manifolds for which \u03b4\u0304n was a strictly\nincreasing function of n for n \u2265 0. Moreover, it was conjectured that the \u03b4\u0304n were\nalways a monotonically increasing function of n for n \u2265 1. We show that this\nconjecture is true. By \u03b4\u0304n \u2264 \u03b4\u0304n+1 (respectively \u03b4\u0304n = 0) we mean that \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) \u2264\n\u03b4\u0304n+1 (\u03c8) (respectively \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = 0) for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X).\nCorollary 2.10. Let X be a closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold. If \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2\nthen\n\u03b4\u03040 \u2264 \u03b4\u03041 \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03b4\u0304n \u2264 * * * .\nIf \u03b21 (X) = 1 and \u03c8 is a generator of H 1 (X) then \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) \u2264 * * * \u2264\n\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) \u2264 * * * .\nAs a consequence of Corollary 2.10, we show (in Theorem 3.8) that if 4-manifold\nof the form X \u00d7 S 1 admits a symplectic structure then X \"looks algebraically like\"\na 3-manifold which fibers over S 1 , thus further supporting a conjecture of Taubes.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.8 uses a theorem of Vidussi in [V2] who proves this theorem\nin the case n = 0.\nTheorem 3.8. Let X be an closed, irreducible 3-manifold such that X \u00d7 S 1 admits\na symplectic structure. If \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2 there exists a \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z) such that\n\u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) = * * * \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = * * * = k\u03c8kT .\nIf \u03b21 (X) = 1 then for any generator \u03c8 of H 1 (X; Z),\n\u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 = \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) = * * * \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = * * * = k\u03c8kT .\nMore generally, we define \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) for any group G and any \"admissible pair\"\n(\u03c6\u0393 : G \u0589 \u0393, \u03c8 : G \u0589 Z) of G. When G is a finitely presented group with\ndef(G) \u2265 1, we show that the \u03b4\u0304n satisfy a monotonicity condition. We also prove a\nsimilar theorem when G is the fundamental group of a closed, orientable 3-manifold\n(see Theorem 2.9).\nTheorem 2.2. Let G be a finitely presented group with def(G) \u2265 1 and (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8)\nbe an admissible triple for G. If (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial then\n(1)\n\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8)\n\notherwise\n(2)\n\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 1.\n\nAs a consequence of the monotonicity theorems, we see that the \u03b4\u0304\u0393 give obstructions to the deficiency of a group being positive or being the fundamental group of\na compact, orientable 3-manifold. These obstructions are non-trivial even when the\ngroups \u0393 and \u039b are abelian. For example, we can easily recover the (known) result\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n3\n\nthat Zm cannot be the fundamental group of a compact 3-manifold when m \u2265 4\n(see below or for more details see Example 3.2).\nProposition 3.1. Let G be a finitely presented group and (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) be an admissible triple for G.\n(1) Suppose (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial. If \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) then def(G) \u2264 0 and G\ncannot be the fundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold (with\nor without boundary).\n(2) Suppose (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial. If \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 then def(G) \u2264 0 and G\ncannot be the fundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold with\nat least one boundary component which is not a 2-sphere. In addition, if\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 then G cannot be the fundamental group of a compact,\norientable 3-manifold (with or without boundary).\nLet us consider the simplest case when \u039b is the abelianization (modulo torsion) of\nG and \u0393 = Z. In this case, \u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8) is equal to the rank of H1 ((XG )\u03c8 ; Z) as an abelian\ngroup where (XG )\u03c8 is the infinite cyclic cover of XG , a finite CW-complex with\n\u03c01 (XG ) = G, corresponding to \u03c8 (as long as this number is finite). Moreover, \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8)\nis equal the Alexander norm of \u03c8 which depends only on \u03c8 and the multivariable\nAlexander polynomial of G. For example, then the Alexander polynomial of Zm is\n1 so \u03b4\u0304Zm (\u03c8) = 0 for any \u03c8. Moreover, the first homology of any infinite cyclic cover\nof the m-torus is Zm\u22121 so \u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8) = m \u2212 1. Thus, as mentioned above, we see that\nZm cannot be the fundamental group of a compact 3-manifold.\nRecall that the ith -order degree of a group \u03b4\u0304i (\u03c8) is a specific example of the\ndegree \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8). We give examples of finite 2-complexes Xn,g with \u03b21 (Xn,g ) = 1 for\nn, g \u2265 1 such that the ith -order degrees for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 of Xn,g are \"large\" but\nthe nth -order degree is 0. Thus the fundamental group of these spaces cannot have\npositive deficiency nor can they be the fundamental group of a compact, orientable\n3-manifold (see Proposition 2.5 and Example 3.4).\nTheorem 2.9 also has applications to the study of the behavior of the genus of a\nknot under a surjective map on \u03c01 . The following question was asked by J. Simon\n(see R. Kirby's Problem List [Ki, Question 1.12(b)]).\nQuestion 1.12(b) of [Ki] (J. Simon). If J and K are knots in S 3 and f : S 3 \\ L \u2192\nS 3 \\ K is surjective on \u03c01 , is g(L) \u2265 g(K)?\nThe answer to the above question is known to be \"yes\" when \u03b40 (K) = 2g(K).\nWe strengthen this result to the case when \u03b4n (K) = 2g(K) \u2212 1.\nCorollary 3.12. Suppose J and K are knots in S 3 such that there exists a surjective homomorphism \u03c1 : \u03c01 (S 3 \\ L) \u0589 \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K). If \u03b4\u03040 (K) = 2g(K) or\n\u03b4\u0304n (K) = 2g(K) \u2212 1 for some n \u2265 1 then g(L) \u2265 g(K).\nWe also prove this is the case if we replace the genus of a knot by the Thurston\nnorm. The following corollary is a generalization of the result due to Gabai [Ga]\nthat a degree one map f : X \u2192 Y between three manifolds gives the inequality\n||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 ||\u03c8||T for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (Y ; Z). For simplicity, we state only the case\nwhen \u03b21 (Y ) \u2265 2.\nCorollary 3.11. Suppose there exists an epimorphism \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X) \u0589 \u03c01 (Y ), where\nX and Y are compact, orientable 3-manifolds, with toroidal or empty boundaries,\n\n\f4\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\nsuch that \u03b21 (X) = \u03b21 (Y ) \u2265 2 and r0 (X) = 0. Let \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (\u03c01 (Y ); Z). If \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) =\n||\u03c8||T for some n \u2265 0 then\n||\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 ||\u03c8||T .\n1. Definitions\nWe will define the higher-order degrees \u03b4\u0304\u0393 and ranks r\u0393 of a group G and surjective homomorphism \u03c6\u0393 : G \u0589 \u0393. This definition will agree with the definition\nof \u03b4\u0304n given for a CW-complex X (as defined in \u00a73 of [Ha1]) when G = \u03c01 (X),\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\n\u0393 = G/Gr\nand \u03c6\u0393 = \u03c6n : G \u0589 G/Gr\n, the natural projection map. For\nmore details see [Ha1, \u00a73, \u00a74 and \u00a75] and [C, \u00a72,\u00a73,\u00a75].\nWe recall the definition of a poly-torsion-free-abelian group.\nDefinition 1.1. A group \u0393 is poly-torsion-free-abelian (PTFA) if it admits a normal series {1} = G0 \u22b3 G1 \u22b3 * * * \u22b3 Gn = \u0393 such that each of the factors Gi+1 /Gi is\ntorsion-free abelian.\nRemark 1.2. Recall that if A \u22b3 G is torsion-free-abelian and G/A is PTFA then\nG is PTFA. Any PTFA group is torsion-free and solvable (the converse is not true).\nAlso, any subgroup of a PTFA group is a PTFA group [P, Lemma 2.4, p.421].\nSome examples of interesting series associated to a group G are the rational\nlower central series of G (see Stallings [Sta]), the rational lower central series of the\n(n)\nrational commutator subgroup of G, the rational derived series Gr of G (defined\n(n)\nbelow), and the torsion-free derived series GH of G (see [CH]). In this paper, our\nexamples and applications will use the rational derived series of a group (defined\nbelow). We point out that the torsion-free derived series is very interesting since\nit gives new concordance invariants of links in S 3 (see [CH] or [Ha2]). For any\nof the subgroups N in the above mentioned series, G/N is a PTFA group. In\n(n+1)\nparticular, for each n \u2265 0, G/ Gr\nis PTFA by Corollary 3.6 of [Ha1]. We recall\n(n)\nthe definition of Gr .\n(0)\n\nDefinition 1.3. Let G be a group and Gr = G. For n \u2265 1 define\nn\nh\ni\no\nG(n)\n= g \u2208 Gr(n\u22121) | g k \u2208 Gr(n\u22121) , Gr(n\u22121) for some k \u2208 Z \u2212 {0}\nr\nto be the nth term of the rational derived series of G.\nR. Strebel showed that if G is the fundamental group of a (classical) knot exterior\nthen the quotients of successive terms of the derived series are torsion-free abelian\n(i)\n[Str]. Hence for knot exteriors we have Gr = G(i) . This is also well known to be\ntrue for free groups. Since any non-compact surface has free fundamental group,\nthis also holds for all orientable surface groups.\nWe make some remarks about PTFA groups. Recall that if \u0393 is PTFA then\nZ\u0393 is an Ore domain and hence Z\u0393 embeds in it right ring of quotients K\u0393 :=\nZ\u0393(Z\u0393 \u2212 {0})\u22121 which is a skew field. More generally, if S \u2286 R is a right divisor\nset of a ring R then the right quotient ring RS \u22121 exists ([P, p.146] or [Ste, p.52]).\nBy RS \u22121 we mean a ring containing R with the property that\n(1) Every element of S has an inverse in RS \u22121 .\n(2) Every element of RS \u22121 is of the form rs\u22121 with r \u2208 R, s \u2208 S.\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n5\n\nIf R is an Ore domain and S is a right divisor set then RS \u22121 is flat as a left R-module\n[Ste, Proposition II.3.5]. In particular, K\u0393 is a flat left Z\u0393-module. Moreover, every\nfinitely generated right module over a skew field is free and such modules have a\nwell defined rank, rankK\u0393 , which is additive on short exact sequences [Co1, p.48].\nThus, if C is a non-negative finite chain complex\nfinitely generated free right\nPof\n\u221e\nZ\u0393-modulesPthen the Euler characteristic \u03c7(C) = i=0 (\u22121)i rank Ci is defined and\n\u221e\nis equal to i=0 (\u22121)i rankK\u0393 Hi (C; K\u0393 ). In this paper, we will repeatedly use this\nfact about the Euler characteristic.\nLet \u03c8 : G \u0589 Z be a surjective homomorphism. Note that we will always be\nconsidering Z as the multiplicative group Z = hti generated by t. We wish to define\n\u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) as an non-negative integer. However, in order to do this, we need some\ncompatibility conditions on \u0393 and \u03c8.\nDefinition 1.4. Let G be a group, \u03c6\u0393 : G \u0589 \u0393, and \u03c8 : G \u0589 Z where \u0393 is a PTFA\ngroup. We say that (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is an admissible pair for G if there exists a surjection\n\u03b1\u0393,Z : \u0393 \u0589 Z such that \u03c8 = \u03b1\u0393,Z \u25e6 \u03c6\u0393 . If \u03b1\u0393,Z is an isomorphism then we say that\n(\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial.\nLet (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) be an admissible pair for G. We define \u0393\u2032 := ker(\u03b1\u0393,Z ). It is clear\nthat (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial if and only if \u0393\u2032 = 1. Since \u0393 is PTFA by Remark 1.2, \u0393\u2032 is\nPTFA. Hence \u0393\u2032 embeds in its right ring of quotients which we call K\u0393 . Moreover,\nZ\u0393\u2032 \u2212{0} is known to be a right divisor set of Z\u0393 [P, p. 609] hence we can define the\nright quotient ring R\u0393 := Z\u0393(Z\u0393\u2032 \u2212 {0})\u22121 . After choosingPa splitting \u03be : Z \u2192 \u0393,\nwe see that any element of R\u0393 can be written uniquely as\ntni ki where t = \u03be(1)\nand ki \u2208 K\u0393 . In this way, one sees that R\u0393 is isomorphic to the skew polynomial\nring K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] (see the proof of Proposition 4.5 of [Ha1] for more details). Moreover,\nthe embedding g\u03c8 : Z\u0393\u2032 \u2192 K\u0393 extends to this isomorphism R\u0393 \u2192 K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] (here we\nare identifying K\u0393 and t0 K\u0393 ).\nThe abelian group (G\u0393 )ab = ker \u03c6\u0393 /[ker \u03c6\u0393 , ker \u03c6\u0393 ] is a right Z\u0393-module via\nconjugation,\n[g]\u03b3 = [\u03b3 \u22121 g\u03b3]\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and g \u2208 ker \u03c6\u0393 . Moreover, (G\u0393 )ab is a Z\u0393\u2032 -module via the inclusion\nZ\u0393\u2032 \u0592\u2192 Z\u0393. Thus, (G\u0393 )ab \u2297Z\u0393 K\u0393 and (G\u0393 )ab \u2297Z\u0393\u2032 K\u0393 are right K\u0393 and K\u0393 -modules\nrespectively.\nDefinition 1.5. Let G be a group and \u03c6\u0393 : G \u0589 \u0393 a coefficient system with \u0393 a\nPTFA group . We define the \u0393-rank of G to be\n\u0013\n\u0012\nker \u03c6\u0393\n\u2297Z\u0393 K\u0393 .\nr\u0393 (G) = rankK\u0393\n[ker \u03c6\u0393 , ker \u03c6\u0393 ]\nFor a general group G and coefficient system \u03c6\u0393 , this rank may be infinite.\nHowever, if G is finitely generated and \u03c6\u0393 is non-zero then by Proposition 2.11 of\n[COT], r\u0393 (G) \u2264 \u03b21 (G) \u2212 1 and hence is finite. In the case that \u03c6\u0393 is the zero map,\nr\u0393 (G) = \u03b21 (G).\nDefinition 1.6. Let G be a finitely generated group and (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) an admissible pair\nfor G. We define the \u0393-degree of \u03c8 to be\n\u0013\n\u0012\nker \u03c6\u0393\n\u2297Z\u0393\u2032 K\u0393\n\u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = rankK\u0393\n[ker \u03c6\u0393 , ker \u03c6\u0393 ]\nif r\u0393 (G) = 0 and \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = 0 otherwise.\n\n\f6\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\nWe remark that (G\u0393 )ab \u2297Z\u0393\u2032 K\u0393 is merely (G\u0393 )ab \u2297Z\u0393 K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] viewed as a K\u0393 module. Since G is a finitely generated group, (G\u0393 )ab \u2297Z\u0393 K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] is a finitely\ngenerated K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]-module. Moreover, since K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] is a (noncommutative left and\nright) principal ideal domain, [Co2, 2.1.1, p.49], the latter is isomorphic to\n\u000e\n\u0001r (G)\n\u2295li=1 K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] hpi (t)i \u2295 K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] \u0393\n\n[J, Theorem 16, p.43]. Thus, (G\u0393 )ab \u2297Z\u0393\u2032 K\u0393 is a finitely generated K\u0393 -module if\nand only if r\u0393 (G) = 0 . In particular, if r\u0393 (G) = 0 then \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) is the sum of the\ndegrees of the pi (t). Therefore, \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) as defined above is always finite.\nLet us consider the case when \u0393 = Zm . Let X be a CW-complex with \u03c01 (X) = G\nand X\u03c6\u0393 be the regular Zm -cover of X corresponding to \u03c6\u0393 . Consider an admissible\npair (\u03c6Zm , \u03c8) for G. This is one such that \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c6\u0393 where \u03c8 \u2032 : Zm \u0589 Z.\nIn this case, H1 (X\u03c6\u0393 ; Z) = ker \u03c6\u0393 / [ker \u03c6\u0393 , ker \u03c6\u0393 ] is a module over the Laurent\npolynomial ring with m variables, Z[Zm ]. Moreover, H1 (X\u03c6\u0393 ; Z) can be considered\nas a module over the Laurent polynomial ring with m \u2212 1 variables Z\u0393\u2032 = Z[Zm\u22121 ].\nNote that the m \u2212 1 variables in Z[Zm\u22121 ] correspond to a choice of basis elements\nof \u0393\u2032 = ker(\u03b1Zm ,Z : Zm \u0589 Z). Therefore, as long as the rank of H1 (X\u03c6\u0393 ; Z) as\na Z[Zm ]-module is 0, \u03b4\u0304Zm (\u03c8) is equal to the rank of H1 (X\u03c6\u0393 ; Z) as a Z[Zm\u22121 ]module. In particular, when m = 1, \u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8) is equal the rank of H1 (X\u03c8 ; Z) as an\nabelian group where X\u03c8 is the infinite cover corresponding to \u03c8 as long as this rank\nis finite (otherwise \u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8) = 0). When Zm is the abelianization of G, \u03b4\u0304Zm (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8)\n(see below for the definition of \u03b4\u03040 ) is equal to the Alexander norm (see [Mc] for the\ndefinition of the Alexander norm) of \u03c8 by [Ha1, Proposition 5.12].\nWe now define the higher-order degrees and ranks associated to a group G. For\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\nis the (n + 1)st -term of the rational\nwhere Gr\neach n \u2265 0, let \u0393n = G/ Gr\nderived series of G as defined in Definition 1.3. We define the nth -order rank of\nX to be\nrn (X) = r\u0393n (X).\n(n+1)\nNext, we remark that if \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z) \u223c\n) = 1. Hence\n= Hom(G; Z), then \u03c8(Gr\n1\nfor each primitive \u03c8 \u2208 H (G; Z) the pair (\u03c6\u0393n , \u03c8) is an admissible pair for G. For\nprimitive \u03c8, we define the nth -order degree of \u03c8 to be\n\n\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304\u0393n (\u03c8).\nFor non-primitive \u03c8, there is a primitive cohomology class \u03c8 \u2032 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z) such that\n\u03c8 = m\u03c8 \u2032 . Define \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = m\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8 \u2032 ).\nThus, for each group G and n \u2265 0 we have defined a function \u03b4\u0304n : H 1 (G; Z) \u2192 Z\nwhich is \"linear on rays through the origin\". We put a partial ordering on these\nfunctions by \u03b4\u0304i \u2264 \u03b4\u0304j if \u03b4\u0304i (\u03c8) \u2264 \u03b4\u0304j (\u03c8) for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z). Also, we say that \u03b4\u0304i = 0\nprovided \u03b4\u0304i (\u03c8) = 0 for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z).\nSuppose f : E \u0589 G is a surjective homomorphism and (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is an admissible\npair for G. Then there is an induced admissible pair (\u03c6\u0393 \u25e6 f, \u03c8 \u25e6 f ) for E. In\nparticular, we can speak \u03b4\u0304\u0393Y E(\u03c8 \u25e6 f ). When we have this situation, unless otherwise\nnoted, we will use this admissible pair induced by G. When there is no confusion,\nwe will suppress the f and just write (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) when we mean (\u03c6\u0393 \u25e6 f, \u03c8 \u25e6 f ) or \u03c8\nwhen we mean \u03c8 \u25e6 f .\nIn this paper, we will often use the notation r\u0393 (X) and \u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8) for X a CWcomplex and \u03c8 an element of H 1 (X; Z) \u223c\n= H 1 (\u03c01 (X); Z). By this, we mean\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n7\n\n\u03c0 (X)\n\nr\u0393 (\u03c01 (X)) and \u03b4\u0304\u03931 (\u03c8) for an admissible pair (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) for \u03c01 (X). These are equivalent to the homological definitions given in [Ha1]. That is, if (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is an admissible\npair for \u03c01 (X) then H1 (X; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) and H1 (X; K\u0393 ) are right K\u0393 and K\u0393 -modules\nrespectively and since K\u0393 and K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] are flat left Z\u0393-modules [Ste, Proposition\nII.3.5], we see that\nr\u0393 (X) = rankK\u0393 H1 (X; K\u0393 )\nand\n\u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = rankK\u0393 H1 (X; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ])\nif r\u0393 (X) = 0 and \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = 0 otherwise.\n2. Main Results\nWe seek to study the behavior of \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) as n increases. More generally, we\nwould like to compare \u03b4\u0304\u0393 as we vary the group \u0393. We show that the \u03b4\u0304\u0393 satisfy a\nmonotonicity condition provided the groups satisfy a compatibility condition. We\ndescribe this condition below.\nDefinition 2.1. Let G be a group, \u03c6\u039b : G \u0589 \u039b, \u03c6\u0393 : G \u0589 \u0393, and \u03c8 : G \u0589 Z where\n\u039b and \u0393 are PTFA groups. We say that (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is an admissible triple for G\nif there exist surjections \u03b1\u039b,\u0393 : \u039b \u0589 \u0393 and \u03b1\u0393,Z : \u0393 \u0589 Z such that \u03c6\u0393 = \u03b1\u039b,\u0393 \u25e6 \u03c6\u039b ,\n\u03c8 = \u03b1\u0393,Z \u25e6 \u03c6\u0393 , and \u03b1\u039b,\u0393 is not an isomorphism. If \u03b1\u0393,Z is an isomorphism then we\nsay that (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial.\nNote that if (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) an admissible triple then (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c8) and (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) are both\nadmissible pairs. Hence, in this case, we can define both \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) and \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8). We note\nthat (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial if and only if (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial. Moreover, (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c8) is never\ninitial since \u039b \u0589 \u0393 is not an isomorphism. We will show that \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) as\nlong as the triple is not initial. We point out that even if \u03b1\u039b,\u0393 is an isomorphism,\nwe can define both the \u039b- and \u0393-degrees and in this case \u03b4\u0393 (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u039b (\u03c8)!\nWe now proceed to state and prove the main theorems.\nTheorem 2.2. Let G be a finitely presented group with def(G) \u2265 1 and (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8)\nbe an admissible triple for G. If (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial then\n(3)\n\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8)\n\notherwise\n(4)\n\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 1.\n\nBefore proving Theorem 2.2, we will state a Corollary of the theorem and make\nsome remarks about the deficiency hypothesis in the theorem. First, let \u0393n be\nthe quotient of G by the (n + 1)st term of the rational derived series as in Definition 1.3. Recall that for any \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z), (\u03c6\u0393n , \u03c8) is an admissible pair. Moreover,\n(n+2)\n(n+1)\nwhich is initial if and\n= Gr\n(\u03c6\u0393n+1 , \u03c6\u0393n , \u03c8) is an admissible triple unless Gr\nonly if \u03b21 (G) = 1 and n = 0. Hence by Theorem 2.2 we see that the \u03b4\u0304n are a\nnondecreasing function of n (for n \u2265 1). This behavior was first established for\nthe fundamental groups of knot complements in S 3 by T. Cochran in [C, Theorem\n5.4]. Recall that \u03b4\u0304n+1 \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (respectively \u03b4\u0304n = 0) means that \u03b4\u0304n+1 (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8)\n(respectively \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = 0) for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z).\n\n\f8\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\nCorollary 2.3. Let G be a finitely presented group with def(G) \u2265 1. If \u03b21 (G) \u2265 2\nthen\n\u03b4\u03040 \u2264 \u03b4\u03041 \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03b4\u0304n \u2264 * * * .\nIf \u03b21 (G) = 1 and \u03c8 is a generator of H 1 (G; Z) then \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 \u2264 \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) \u2264 * * * \u2264\n\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) \u2264 * * * .\n(n+1)\n\n(n+2)\n\nProof. Let \u03c8 be a primitive class in H 1 (G; Z). We can assume that Gr\n6= Gr\n(n+1)\n(n+2)\nsince if Gr\n= Gr\nthen \u03b4\u0304n+1 (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) (note that in the case \u03b21 (G) = 1 and\nn = 0, \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 is also satisfied). Therefore T = (\u03c6\u0393n+1 , \u03c6\u0393n , \u03c8)\nis an admissible triple. As mentioned above, T is initial if and only if \u03b21 (G) = 1\nand n = 0. Hence if \u03b21 (G) = 1 and n = 0 then by Theorem 2.2, \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 1.\nOtherwise, \u03b4\u0304n+1 (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8).\nIf \u03b21 (G) \u2265 2 and \u03c8 is not primitive then \u03c8 = m\u03c8 \u2032 for some primitive \u03c8 \u2032 and\nm \u2265 2. Hence, \u03b4\u0304n+1 (\u03c8) = m\u03b4\u0304n+1 (\u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2265 m\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8 \u2032 ) = \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8).\n\u0003\nWe now make some remarks about the condition def(G) \u2265 1. First, if G has\ndeficiency at least 2 then the results of Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 hold simply\nbecause all of the degrees are zero.\nRemark 2.4. If G is a finitely presented group with def(G) \u2265 2 and (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is an\nadmissible pair for G then r\u0393 (G) \u2265 1 and hence \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = 0.\nTo see this, let XG be a finite, connected 2-complex with one 0-cell x0 , m 1cells, r 2-cells where m \u2212 r \u2265 2 and G = \u03c01 (XG , x0 ). Then H1 (XG , x0 ; K\u0393 ) has\na presentation with m generators and r relations so rankK\u0393 H1 (XG , x0 ; K\u0393 ) \u2265 2\nand hence r\u0393 (G) = r\u0393 (XG ) = rankK\u0393 H1 (XG , x0 ; K\u0393 ) \u2212 1 \u2265 1 [Ha1, \u00a74 and \u00a75].\nTherefore, \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = 0 for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z).\nHowever, if the deficiency of G is not positive, we can create an infinite number\nof examples where the theorem is false! We construct finitely presented groups for\nwhich the degrees are \"large\" up to (but not including) the nth stage but the degree\nat the nth stage is zero! For simplicity, we only describe examples when \u03b21 (G) = 1.\nHowever, the reader should notice that the same type of behavior can be seen for\ngroups with \u03b21 (G) \u2265 2 using the same techniques.\nProposition 2.5. For each g \u2265 1 and n \u2265 1 there exist examples of finitely\npresented groups Gn,g with def(Gn,g ) \u2264 0 and \u03b21 (Gn,g ) = 1 such that \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) = 2g,\n\u03b4\u0304i (\u03c8) = 2g \u2212 1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = 0 whenever \u03c8 is a generator of\nH 1 (Gn,g ; Z).\nProof. We will construct these examples by adding relations to the fundamental\n\u000e\ngroup of a fibered knot complement G that kill the generators the G(n+1) G(n+2) \u2297\nKn . Let G be the fundamental group of a fibered knot K in S 3 of genus g \u2265 1\n(n+1)\n(n+2)\nand n \u2265 1. Since\nK is fibered, G(1) is free, so Gr\n/Gr\n= G(n+1) /G(n+2) and\n\u000e (n+2)\n(n+1)\nAn = G\nG\n\u2297Z\u0393\u2032n Kn is a finitely generated free right Kn -module of rank\n2g \u2212 1. Let a1 , . . . , a2g\u22121 be the generators of An . Since Kn is an Ore domain, we\ncan find kj \u2208 Kn such that aj kj \u2208 G(n+1) /G(n+2) \u2297 1. Pick \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b32g\u22121 \u2208 G(n+1)\nsuch that [\u03b3j ] = aj kj and let H = G/ < \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b32g\u22121 > and \u03b7 : G \u0589 H. Note\nthat since any knot group has deficiency 1, H has a presentation with m generators\nand m + 2g \u2212 2 relations. Since \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b32g\u22121 \u2208 G(n+1) , we have an isomorphism\n(n+1)\n. Therefore, \u03b4\u03040H (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u03040G (\u03c8) = 2g and \u03b4\u0304iY (\u03c8) =\nG/G(n+1) \u223c\n= H/Hr\n= H/H (n+1) \u223c\nX\n\u03b4\u0304i (\u03c8) = 2g \u2212 1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1.\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n9\n\nSince G\u2032 \u0589 H \u2032 , we have H \u2032 /H (n+1) \u223c\n= G\u2032 /G(n+1) for 0 \u2264 i \u000e\u2264 n hence Kn =\nH (n+1) , the map G(n+1) G(n+2) \u2297 Kn \u2192\nthe generators of An are sent to zero under\n(n+1)\nFinally, Hr\n= H (n+1) so\n\u0012 (n+1) \u001e\n\u0013\n(n+1)\nH (n+1)\nH\nHr\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u2297 Kn = (n+2) \u2297 Kn =\n{Z-torsion} \u2297 Kn = 0\n(n+2)\nH (n+2)\nHr\nHr\n\n\u223c H . Moreover, since G(n+1) \u0589\nKG\nn = K\n\u000en\nH (n+1) H (n+2) \u2297 Kn is surjective. But\nthis map, so H (n+1) /H (n+2) \u2297 Kn = 0.\n\n(see Lemma 3.5 of [Ha1] for the second isomorphism) hence \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe will now prove Theorem 2.2.\nProof of Theorem 2.2. If the deficiency of G is at least 2 then by Remark 2.4, all of\nthe degrees are zero hence the conclusions of the theorem are true. Now we prove\nthe case when def(G) = 1. We can assume that r\u0393 (G) = 0, otherwise \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) = 0\nand hence the statement of the theorem is true since \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) is always non-negative.\nSince G is finitely presented, there is a finite 2-complex X such that G = \u03c01 (X)\nand \u03c7(X) = 1 \u2212 def(G) = 0. Recall that X is obtained from the presentation of G\nwith deficiency 1 by starting with one 0-cell, attaching a 1-cell for each generator\nand a 2-cell for each relation in the presentation of G. Since \u0393 \u0589 Z and \u03c6\u0393 is\nsurjective, Hi (X; K\u0393 ) = 0 for i 6= 1, 2 [COT, Proposition 2.9]. Moreover, \u03c7(X) = 0\nimplies that rankK\u0393 H2 (X; K\u0393 ) = rankK\u0393 H1 (X; K\u0393 ) = r\u0393 (G) = 0 since the Euler\ncharacteristic can be computed using K\u0393 -coefficients as mentioned in \u00a7- 1. Since\nr\u0393 (X) = 0, it follows that r\u039b (X) = 0 [Ha2]. Replacing \u0393 by \u039b in the above\nargument, it follows that rankK\u039b H2 (X; K\u039b ) = 0.\nLet X\u03c8 be the infinite cyclic cover of X corresponding to \u03c8. There is a coefficient\nsystem for X\u03c8 , \u03c6\u2032\u0393 : \u03c01 (X\u03c8 ) \u0589 \u0393\u2032 , given by restricting \u03c6\u0393 to \u03c01 (X\u03c8 ). Moreover, as\nK\u0393 -modules H1 (X; K\u0393 ) \u223c\n= H1 (X\u03c8 ; K\u0393 ) so H1 (X\u03c8 ; K\u0393 ) is a finitely generated free\nK\u0393 -module of rank \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) (similarly for \u039b). Since \u0393\u2032 is PTFA (and hence Z\u0393\u2032 is an\nOre domain), there exists a wedge of e circles W and a map f : W \u2192 X\u03c8 such that\nf\u2217 : H1 (W ; K\u0393 ) \u2192 H1 (X\u03c8 ; K\u0393 )\nis an isomorphism. Here, the coefficient system on W is given by \u03c6\u2032\u0393 \u25e6 f\u2217 . By the\nproof of Lemma 2.1 in [COT], ker \u03c6\u0393 6= ker \u03c8 if and only if \u03c6\u2032\u0393 \u25e6 f\u2217 is non-trivial.\nMoreover, since W is a finite connected 2-complex with H2 (W ) = 0, if ker \u03c6\u0393 6=\nker \u03c8 then H1 (W ; K\u0393 ) \u223c\n= K\u0393e\u22121 [COT, Lemma 2.12]; otherwise H1 (W ; K\u0393 ) \u223c\n= Ke\u0393 .\nUp to homotopy we can assume that W is a subcomplex of X\u03c8 by replacing\nX\u03c8 with the mapping cylinder of f . Consider the long exact sequence of the pair\n(X\u03c8 , W ) with coefficients in K\u0393 :\nH2 (X\u03c8 ; K\u0393 ) \u2192 H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; K\u0393 ) \u2192 H1 (W ; K\u0393 ) \u2192 H1 (X\u03c8 ; K\u0393 ).\nSince X has no 3-cells, there is a cell complex, Ci (X; Z\u0393), which has no 3-cells.\nTherefore, T H2 (X; Z\u0393), the Z\u0393-torsion submodule of H2 (X; Z\u0393), is zero. Now,\nthe kernel of the map H2 (X; Z\u0393) \u2192 H2 (X; K\u0393 ) is T H2 (X; Z\u0393). Moreover, we\nhave shown that H2 (X; K\u0393 ) = 0 hence H2 (X; Z\u0393) = 0. Thus, H2 (X\u03c8 ; K\u0393 ) \u223c\n=\nH2 (X; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) \u223c\n= H2 (X; Z\u0393)\u2297Z\u0393 K[t\u00b11 ] = 0. Since the last arrow in the sequence is\nan isomorphism, H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; K\u0393 ) = 0. Our goal is to show that H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; K\u039b ) = 0.\nThen by analyzing the long exact sequence of the pair (X\u03c8 , W ) with coefficients in\nK\u039b , it will follow that H1 (W ; K\u039b ) \u2192 H1 (X\u03c8 ; K\u039b ) is a monomorphism. We note\nthat ker \u03c6\u039b 6= ker \u03c6\u0393 implies that rankK\u039b H1 (W ; K\u039b ) = e \u2212 1 as above. Thus, if\n\n\f10\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\nker \u03c6\u0393 6= ker \u03c8 then (assuming the monomorphism above) \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 e \u2212 1 = \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8);\notherwise \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 e \u2212 1 = \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 1.\nConsider the relative chain complex of (X\u03c8 , W ) with coefficients in Z\u0393\u2032 :\n\u2032\n\n\u2202\u0393\n\n2\n0 \u2192 C2 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u0393\u2032 ) \u2212\u2212\n\u2192 C1 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u0393\u2032 ) \u2192 .\n\nSince W has no 2-cells, X\u03c8 has no 3-cells. Therefore H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u0393\u2032 ) is Z\u0393\u2032 -torsion\n\u2032\nfree, so H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; K\u0393 ) = 0 implies that H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u0393\u2032 ) = 0 and hence \u22022\u0393 is\ninjective.\nLet A = ker(\u03b1\u039b,\u0393 |\u039b\u2032 : \u039b\u2032 \u0589 \u0393\u2032 ). Since A is a subgroup of a PTFA group, A\nis PTFA by Remark 1.2. If M is any right Z\u039b\u2032 -module then M \u2297ZA Z has the\nstructure of a right Z\u0393\u2032 -module given by\nX\nX\n\u03c3 \u2297 n)\u03b3 =\n\u03c3\u03b3 \u2297 n\n(\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 . Moreover, one can check that C\u2217 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u039b\u2032 ) \u2297ZA Z is isomorphic\nto C\u2217 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u0393\u2032 ) as right Z\u0393\u2032 -modules. Thus, after making this identification,\n\u2032\n\u22022\u039b : C2 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u039b\u2032 ) \u2192 C1 (X\u03c8 , W ; Z\u039b\u2032 ) is injective by the following result of R.\nStrebel.\n\nProposition 2.6 (R. Strebel, [Str] p. 305). Suppose \u0393 is a PTFA group and R\nis a commutative ring. Any map between projective right R\u0393-modules whose image\nunder the functor \u2212\u2297R\u0393 is injective, is itself injective.\nFinally, since K\u039b is flat as a Z\u039b\u2032 -module, H2 (X\u03c8 , W ; K\u039b ) = 0 as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nSuppose \u039b and \u0393 are abelian groups and G is the fundamental group of a compact\norientable manifold with toroidal (or empty) boundary. In this case, it can easily\nbe shown, using the results in [Mc] and [Ha1], that the inequalities in Theorem 2.2\n(and Theorem 2.9 below) are in fact equalities for all \u03c8 which lie in the cone of an\nopen face of the Alexander norm ball. We show below that even in this case, there\nare \u03c8 for which the inequality in Theorem 2.2 is necessary.\nExample 2.7. Let X be the exterior of the Borromean rings in S 3 and let G\nbe the fundamental group of the X. A Wirtinger presentation of G is given by\nx, y, z | [z, [x, y \u22121 ]], [y, [z, x\u22121 ]] (see [F, p.10] for a similar presentation). Thus,\nthere is an epimorphism f : G \u0589 hy, zi by sending x to 1. Let \u03c8(0,m,n) : G \u0589 Z be\nthe homomorphism defined by \u03c8(x) = 1, \u03c8(y) = tm , \u03c8(z) = tn where gcd(m, n) =\n1. Since f factors through \u03c8(0,m,n) , the rank of H1 of the infinite cyclic cover of X\ncorresponding to \u03c8(0,m,n) is non-zero (see, for example, [Ha, Proposition 2.2]). It\nfollows that \u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8(0,m,n) ) = 0. However, one can compute the Alexander polynomial\nof X (from the presentation of G) to be \u2206X = (x \u2212 1)(y \u2212 1)(z \u2212 1). Therefore,\n\u03b4\u0304Z3 (\u03c8(0,m,n) ) = |m| + |n| > 0.\nNow we consider the case when G is the fundamental group of a closed 3manifold. In this case, the deficiency of G is 0 so Theorem 2.2 does not suffice to\nprove a monotonicity result for G. The proof that the degrees satisfy a monotonicity relation will use Theorem 2.2 for 2-complexes but will also use some additional\ntopology of the 3-manifold. Before stating the corresponding theorem for closed\n3-manifolds, we introduce an important lemma which will be used in the proof of\nTheorem 2.9.\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n11\n\nLemma 2.8. Let K be a nullhomologous knot in a 3-manifold X, MK be the 0surgery on K, \u03c8 : \u03c01 (MK ) \u0589 Z which maps the meridian of K to a nonzero element\nof Z, and (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) be an admissible pair for \u03c01 (MK ). If r\u0393 (MK ) = 0 and (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is\nnot initial then the longitude of K is not 0 in H1 (X \\ K; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]).\nProof. Let l \u2282 N (K) be the longitude of K. Here, N (K) is an open neighborhood\nof K in X. Note that MK = (X \\ N (K)) \u222a e2 \u222a e3 where the attaching circle of e2\nis l. Since X \\ N (K) is homotopy equivalent to X \\ K we use the latter.

By analyzing the attaching map of\n\u2202e3 , we see that \u03c0 \u25e6 \u22023 is the map which sends 1 to tr \u2212 1 where tr is the image of\nthe meridian of K under \u03c6. Since r 6= 0 we see that this map is never surjective\nsince tr \u2212 1 is not a unit in K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ].\nSince r\u0393 (MK ) = 0, by Remark 2.8 of [COT] we have H2 (MK ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) \u223c\n=\n1\nH (MK ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) \u223c\n= Ext1K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] (H0 (MK ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]), K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]). By the proof of Propo\u000e\nsition 2.9 in [COT], H0 (MK ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) = K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] (K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] * I) where I is the\naugmentation ideal of Z\u03c01 (MK ) acting via Z\u03c01 (MK ) \u2192 Z\u0393 \u2192 K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]. Thus,\nH0 (MK ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) 6= 0 if and only if (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial. Thus, if (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial,\n\u22023 is surjective. Suppose [l] = 0 in H1 (X \\ K; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]), then \u03c0 would be surjective,\nmaking \u03c0 \u25e6 \u22023 surjective which is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nConsider the situation when X\u000e= S 3 \\ K, G = \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K), \u03c8 is the abelianization\nmap of G, and \u03c6\u0393 : G \u0589 \u0393 = G G(2) be the quotient map where G(n) is the nth\nterm of the derived series of G. It is known that \u0393 is a PTFA group [Str].\u000e Let l\nbe the longitude of K. Since l \u2208 G(2) , \u03c6\u0393 extends to a map \u03c01 (MK ) \u0589 G G(2) .\nWe note that in this case, the pair (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial if and only if the Alexander\npolynomial is 1. The longitude being nonzero in H1 (S 3 \\ K; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) implies that\nG(2)\nl is nonzero in H1 (S 3 \\ K; Z\u0393) = G\n(3) . Hence, if the Alexander polynomial of K is\nnot 1 then l 6\u2208 G(3) . This was first proved by T.

Let X be a closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold with\nG = \u03c01 (X). We will need the following lemma which is an extension of a lemma of\nC. Lescop [L].\nLemma 2.11. Let X be a closed, connected, orientable 3-manifold and \u03c8 : \u03c01 (X) \u0589\nZ = hti be a surjective map. X can be presented as surgery on an framed link,\n\u03b21 (x)\nLi , in a rational homology sphere R such that\nL = \u2210i=1\n(1) the components of L are null-homologous in R\n(2) the surgery coefficients on Li are all 0\n(3) lk(Li , Lj ) = 0 for i 6= j and\n(4) \u03c8(\u03bci ) = t\u03b41i when \u03bci is a meridian of Li and \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta.\nProof of Lemma. By Lemma 5.1.1 in [L], X can be obtained by surgery on a\nframed link L with \u03b21 (X) components such that (2), (3), and (1) are satisfied.\nNow we note that any automorphism of H1 (X)/{Z-torsion} \u223c\n= Z\u03b21 (X) corresponds\nto a sequence of handleslides and reordering or reorienting of the components of\nL. Moreover, since \u03c8 is a surjective map to Z, there exists an automorphism of\nH1 (X)/{Z-torsion} that sends the first basis element to t (a generator of Z) and\nthe other basis elements to t0 = 1. That is, we can do a sequence of handleslides\n(along with possible reorienting or reordering) to get a new link L\u2032 for which the\nmeridian of the first component maps to t and the other meridians map to 1. Since\nthe original surgery coefficients and linking numbers of L were 0, the same is true\nfor L\u2032 . We also note that the components of L\u2032 are null-homologous in R.\n\u0003\nBy Lemma 2.11 above, X can be presented as surgery on a framed link L =\n\u03b21 (x)\nLi , in a rational homology sphere R such that the first component, L1 , has\n\u2210i=1\nsurgery coefficient 0, lk(L1 , Li ) = 0 for i 6= 1 and \u03c8(\u03bc1 ) = t when \u03bc1 is a meridian\nof L1 . Let l be the longitude of L1 and Y \u2032 be the space obtained by performing\n0-surgery in R on the components L2 , . . . , Lk . Let Y = Y \u2032 \u2212 N (L1 ) where N (L1 )\nis a open neighborhood of L1 in Y \u2032 . Finally, X \u2032 = Y \u222al D2 be the space obtained\nby adding a 2-disk to Y which identifies \u2202D2 with l.\nAfter picking a basepoint in Y (hence in X and X \u2032 ), we note that the inclusion\n\u223c\n=\nmap induces an isomorphism i\u2217 : \u03c01 (X \u2032 ) \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c01 (X). Thus any coefficient system\n\u03c6\u0393 for X induces a coefficient system for X \u2032 . Moreover, if M is any Z\u0393-module\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n13\n\n\u2032\nthen H1 (X; M ) \u223c\n= H1 (X \u2032 ; M ). In particular, r\u0393 (X) = r\u0393 (X \u2032 ) and \u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8)\nfor all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X) \u223c\n= H 1 (X \u2032 ). Since l is null-homologous in Y , we can identify\n1\n\u2032\n1\nH (X ) and H (Y ). We define the coefficient systems and admissible pairs for\n\u03c01 (Y ) by pre-composing the coefficient systems and admissible pairs for \u03c01 (X)\nwith \u03c01 (Y ) \u2192 \u03c01 (X) induced by the inclusion Y \u2282 X.\nWe pick the splitting s : Z \u2192 \u0393 which sends t to \u03c6\u0393 (\u03bc1 ). Now we consider the\nlong exact sequence of the pair (X \u2032 , Y ) :\n\n\u2202\n\n2\nH1 (Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) \u2192 H1 (X \u2032 ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) \u2192 0.\n\u2192 H2 (X \u2032 , Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) \u2212\u2192\n\u223c K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ] generated by the relative 2As a K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]-module H2 (X \u2032 , Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) =\n\u2032\ncell \u03b1. Hence as a K\u0393 -module, H2 (X , Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) is an infinitely generated free\nmodule, generated by \u03b1tk for k \u2208 Z. Since the 2-cell is attached along l, we have\n\u2202\u03b1 = [l]. We note that l and \u03bc1 live on \u2202N (L1 ), hence [l, \u03bc1 ] = 1 \u2208 \u03c01 (Y ). Thus,\n[l](t \u2212 1) = 0 in H1 (Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]). Equivalently, [l] = [l]tk for all k hence the image\nof \u22022 as a K\u0393 -module has at most one dimension and is generated by [l].\nUsing the same argument as in the first paragraph of Theorem 2.2, we can assume\nthat r\u0393 (X) = 0 and rank\u0393 H2 (X; K\u0393 ) = 0. Since [l] is t \u2212 1 torsion, the \u22022 map\nin the long exact sequence of the pair (X \u2032 , Y ) with coefficients in K\u0393 is 0. Since\nr\u0393 (X \u2032 ) = r\u0393 (X) = 0, we see that r\u0393 (Y ) = 0. By the Theorem in [Ha2], r\u039b (Y ) = 0.\nThus, H1 (Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) and H1 (X \u2032 ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) are finitely generated right K\u0393 -modules\n\u2032\nof dimensions \u03b4\u0304\u0393Y (\u03c8) and \u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8) respectively.\nSince r\u0393 (X) = 0, if (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial then [l] 6= 0 in H1 (Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]) by\nLemma 2.8. Also, we note that if (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial, then \u0393 = Z so all of the\nmeridians except \u03c81 lift to the \u0393-cover. Moreover, since l is nullhomologous in Y ,\nit bounds a surface F in Y . F will lift to the \u0393-cover which implies that l = 0\nin H1 (Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]). Thus, (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial if and only if [l] = 0 in H1 (Y ; K\u0393 [t\u00b11 ]).\nRecall that (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c8) is never initial.\nSuppose (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial. Then (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial hence \u03b4\u0304\u0393Y (\u03c8) =\n\u2032\n\u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8) + 1 (similarly for \u0393). Since Y is homotopy equivalent to a 2-complex with\nY\n\u03c7(Y ) = 0, \u03b4\u0304\u039b\n(\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393Y (\u03c8) by Theorem 2.2.

Then (\u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial so \u03b4\u0304\u0393Y (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304\u0393X (\u03c8) but\nY\nX\u2032\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b\n(\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304\u039b\n(\u03c8)+1.

HARVEY\n\nof a CW-complex X only depend on the fundamental group of X.

Let G be a finitely presented group and (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) be an admissible triple for G.\n(1) Suppose (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial. If \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) then def(G) \u2264 0 and G\ncannot be the fundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold (with\nor without boundary).\n(2) Suppose (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial. If \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 then def(G) \u2264 0 and G\ncannot be the fundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold with\nat least one boundary component which is not a 2-sphere. In addition, if\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 then G cannot be the fundamental group of a compact,\norientable 3-manifold (with or without boundary).\nProof. First, suppose that def(G) \u2265 1. Then, by Theorem 2.2, \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) when\n(\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial and \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 when (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial.\nNow, suppose that G is the fundamental group of a closed, orientable, 3-manifold\nX. Then, by Theorem 2.9, \u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8) when (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is not initial and\n\u03b4\u0304\u039b (\u03c8) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304\u0393 (\u03c8)\u2212 2 when (\u03c6\u039b , \u03c6\u0393 , \u03c8) is initial. Finally, suppose G is the fundamental\ngroup of a connected, orientable 3-manifold with boundary. If at least 1 boundary\ncomponent is not a 2-sphere then def(G) \u2265 1 in which case the paragraph above\napplies. Moreover, if all the boundary components X are 2-spheres then G is the\nfundamental group of a closed 3-manifold.\n\u0003\nWe point out that Proposition 3.1 is sometimes very easy to use computationally\nsince the groups \u039b and \u0393 can be taken to be finitely generated free abelian groups.\nUsing Proposition 3.1, one can easily prove the well known fact that Zm cannot be\nthe group of a compact 3-manifold when n \u2265 4.\nExample 3.2. Consider the initial triple (idZm , \u03c8, \u03c8) for Zm where \u03c8 : Zm \u0589 Z is\nany surjective map. Since ker(\u03c8) \u223c\n= Zm\u22121 , we see that \u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8) = m \u2212 1. Moreover,\nsince ker(idZm ) = 0, we see that \u03b4\u0304Zm (\u03c8) = 0. Therefore, if m \u2265 4, 0 = \u03b4\u0304Zm (\u03c8) <\n\u03b4\u0304Z (\u03c8) \u2212 2 = m \u2212 3. Thus, by Proposition 3.1, for m \u2265 4, def(Zm ) \u2264 0 and Zm\ncannot be the fundamental group of any compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold.\nIf we consider the case when the groups \u0393 and \u039b are quotients of G by the\nterms of its rational derived series we have the following immediate corollary to\nProposition 3.1.\nCorollary 3.3. Let G be a finitely presented group.\n(1) Suppose \u03b21 (G) \u2265 2. If there exists a \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (G; Z), and m, n \u2208 Z such\nthat n > m \u2265 0 and \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304m (\u03c8) then def(G) \u2264 0 and G cannot be the\nfundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold.\n(2) Suppose \u03b21 (G) = 1 and \u03c8 in a generator of H 1 (G; Z).\n(a) If there exists m, n \u2208 Z such that n > m \u2265 1 and \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304m (\u03c8)\nthen def(G) \u2264 0 and G cannot be the fundamental group of a compact,\norientable 3-manifold.\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n15\n\n(b) If there exists an n \u2208 Z such that n \u2265 1 and \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 then\ndef(G) \u2264 0 and G cannot be the fundamental group of a compact,\norientable 3-manifold with at least one boundary component which is\nnot a 2-sphere. In addition, if \u03b4\u0304n < \u03b4\u03040 \u2212 2 then G cannot be the\nfundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold.\nExample 3.4. We saw that the examples Gn,g in Proposition 2.5 satisfy \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) <\n\u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 when n = 1 and g = 1, \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 when n = 1 and g \u2265 2,\nand \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) < \u03b4\u0304n\u22121 (\u03c8) when n \u2265 2. Thus, by Corollary 3.3, for each n \u2265 1 and\ng \u2265 1 the groups Gn,g in Proposition 2.5 have def(Gn,g ) \u2264 0. Moreover, except\nin the case that g = 1 and n = 1, for each n \u2265 1 and g \u2265 1, the group Gn,g\ncannot be the fundamental group of a compact, orientable 3-manifold (with or\nwithout boundary). The group G1,1 cannot be the fundamental group of a compact,\norientable 3-manifold with at least one boundary component which is not a 2-sphere.\n3.2.

We will show\nthat a consequence of Corollaries 2.3 and 2.10 is that the \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) give obstructions\nto a 4-manifold of the form X \u00d7 S 1 admitting a symplectic structure. It is well\nknown that if X is a closed 3-manifold that fibers over S 1 then X \u00d7 S 1 admits a\nsymplectic structure. Taubes asks whether the converse is true.\nQuestion 3.5 (Taubes). Let X be a 3-manifold such that X \u00d7 S 1 admits a symplectic structure. Does X admit a fibration over S 1 ?\nIn [Ha1], we showed that if X is a 3-manifold that fibers over S 1 with \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2\nand \u03c8 representing the fibration then \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) is equal to Thurston norm k\u03c8kT of\n\u03c8. This generalized the work of McMullen who showed that the Alexander norm\ngives a lower bound for the Thurston norm which is an equality when \u03c8 represents\na fibration.\nTheorem 3.6 ([Ha1]). Let X be a compact, orientable 3-manifold (possibly with\nboundary). For all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z) and n \u2265 0\n\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) \u2264 k\u03c8kT\nexcept for the case when \u03b21 (X) = 1, n = 0, X \u2247 S 1 \u00d7 S 2 , and X \u2247 S 1 \u00d7 D2 . In\nthis case, \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2264 k\u03c8kT + 1 + \u03b23 (X) whenever \u03c8 is a generator of H 1 (X; Z) \u223c\n= Z.\nMoreover, equality holds in all cases when \u03c8 : \u03c01 (X) \u0589 Z can be represented by a\nfibration X \u2192 S 1 .\nUsing the work of Meng-Taubes and Kronheimer-Mrowka, S. Vidussi [V2] has\nrecently given a proof of McMullen's inequality (that the Alexander norm gives a\nlower bound for the Thurston norm of a 3-manifold) using Seiberg-Witten theory.\nThis generalizes the work of Kronheimer [K2] who dealt with the case that X is the\n0-surgery on a knot. Moreover, Vidussi shows that if X \u00d7 S 1 admits a symplectic\nstructure (and \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2) then the Alexander and Thurston norms of X coincide\non a cone over a face of the Thurston norm ball of X, supporting a positive answer\nto Question 3.5 asked by Taubes.\nTheorem 3.7 (Kronheimer, Vidussi [K2, V1, V2]). Let X be an closed, irreducible\n3-manifold such that X \u00d7S 1 admits a symplectic structure. If \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2 there exists\na \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z) such that k\u03c8kA = k\u03c8kT . If \u03b21 (X) = 1 then for any generator \u03c8\nof H 1 (X; Z), k\u03c8kA = k\u03c8kT + 2.\n\n\f16\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\nIn [Ha1, Theorem 12.5], we used Vidussi's result and our result that the \u03b4\u0304n give\nlower bounds for the Thurston norm [Ha1, Theorem 10.1] to show that the higherorder degrees of a 3-manifold X give algebraic obstructions to a 4-manifold of the\nform X \u00d7 S 1 admitting a symplectic structure. As a result, we were able to show\nthat the closed, irreducible 3-manifolds (with \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2) in Theorem 11.1 of [Ha1]\nhave \u03b4\u03040 < \u03b4\u03041 < * * * < \u03b4\u0304n hence cannot admit a symplectic structure. However,\nit was still unknown at this time whether Vidussi's Theorem holds if one replaces\nthe Alexander norm with \u03b4\u0304n . In [Ha1, Conjecture 12.7], we conjectured this to be\ntrue. Since the Alexander norm is equal to \u03b4\u03040 , Vidussi's theorem gives us the case\nwhen n = 0. We will show that Conjecture 12.7 of [Ha1] is true when n \u2265 1. This\nis theoretically important since it gives more evidence that the only symplectic 4manifolds of the form X \u00d7 S 1 are such that X fibers over S 1 , supporting a positive\nanswer to the question of Taubes.\nTheorem 3.8. Let X be a closed, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold such that\nX \u00d7 S 1 admits a symplectic structure. If \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2 there exists a \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z)\nsuch that\n\u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) = * * * = \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = * * * = k\u03c8kT .\nIf \u03b21 (X) = 1 then for any generator \u03c8 of H 1 (X; Z),\n\u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 = \u03b4\u03041 (\u03c8) = * * * \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = * * * = k\u03c8kT .\nProof. If X is a closed, orientable, irreducible, 3-manifold with \u03b21 (X) \u2265 2 such\nthat X \u00d7 S 1 admits a symplectic structure then by Theorem 3.7 there exists a \u03c8 \u2208\nH 1 (X; Z) such that \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) = k\u03c8kA = k\u03c8kT . By Corollary 2.10 and Theorem 3.6,\n\u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2264 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) \u2264 k\u03c8kT hence for all n \u2265 0, \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) = \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = k\u03c8kT . Similarly, if\n\u03b21 (X) = 1 then for \u03c8 a generator of H 1 (X; Z), \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 = k\u03c8kT . Since S 1 \u00d7 S 2\nis not irreducible, for n \u2265 1 we have \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) \u2264 k\u03c8kT hence \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 2 =\n\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = k\u03c8kT .\n\u0003\n3.3. Behavior of the Thurston norm under a continuous map which is\nsurjective on \u03c01 . An important problem in 3-manifold topology is determine the\nbehavior of the Thurston norm under continuous maps f : X \u2192 Y between 3manifolds. It was shown by D. Gabai in [Ga] that if f is a p-fold covering map\nthen ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T = p ||\u03c8||T . Moreover, Gabai showed that if f is a degree d map\nthen ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 |d| ||\u03c8||T . These statements were first conjectured by Thurston\nhis original paper on the Thurston norm in [Th, Conjecture 2(b)]. We sketch a\nproof of the latter, since it does not seem to explicitly appear in [Ga].\nTheorem 3.9 (Gabai). Let f : X \u2192 Y be a degree d map between closed, orientable, 3-manifolds. Then for each \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (Y ; Z), ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 |d| ||\u03c8||T .\nProof. Let \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (Y ; Z) and F be an embedded (possibly disconnected) surface\nin X such that [F ] is dual to f \u2217 (\u03c8) and \u03c7\u2212 (F ) = ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T . Since the following\ndiagram commutes [Mu, Theorem 67.2], [f (F )] = f\u2217 ([F ]) = d(\u03c8 \u2229 \u0393Y ).\nH 1 (X; Z)\n\u273b\nf\u2217\nH 1 (Y ; Z)\n\n\u2229\u0393X\n\u2732 H2 (X; Z)\n\u223c\n=\nf\u2217\n\u2744\n\u2229d\u0393\u2732\nY\nH2 (Y ; Z)\n\n\fMONOTONICITY OF THE DEGREES\n\n17\n\nBy Corollary 6.18 of [Ga], || \u2212 ||T = xs (\u2212) where xs is the singular norm. Hence\n|d| ||\u03c8||T \u2264 \u03c7\u2212 (f (F )) \u2264 \u03c7\u2212 (F ) = ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T .\n\u0003\nRecall that a degree one map is surjective on \u03c01 . Hence one could ask if the\nexistence of a map f : X \u2192 Y between compact, orientable, 3-manifolds, that is\nsurjective on \u03c01 suffices to guarantee that ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 ||\u03c8||T for all \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (Y ; Z).\nWe will give some (algebraic) conditions on X and Y (i.e. that do not depend on\nthe map f ) that will guarantee ||f \u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 ||\u03c8||T .\nThis question was first asked by J. Simon (see Kirby's Problem List [Ki, Question\n1.12(b)]) for knot complements. Recall that if K is a nontrivial knot in S 3 then\nH 1 (S 3 \\ K; Z) \u223c\n= Z generated by \u03c8 and ||\u03c8||T = 2g(K) \u2212 1 where g(K) is the genus\nof K.\nQuestion 1.12(b) of [Ki] (J. Simon). If J and K are knots in S 3 and f : S 3 \\ L \u2192\nS 3 \\ K is surjective on \u03c01 , is g(L) \u2265 g(K)?\nThe answer to the above question is known to be yes when \u03b40 (K) = 2g(K).\nWe strengthen this result to the case when \u03b4n (K) = 2g(K) \u2212 1 in Corollary 3.13.\nBy \u03b4\u0304n (K) we mean \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) for a generator \u03c8 of H 1 (S 3 \\ K; Z) \u223c\n= Z. Note that by\nTheorems 5.4 and 7.1 of [C],\n\u03b4\u03040 (K) \u2212 1 \u2264 \u03b4\u03041 (K) \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03b4\u0304n (K) \u2264 * * * \u2264 2g(K) \u2212 1.\nMoreover, by Corollary 7.4 of [C], there exist knots K for which \u03b4\u03040 (K)\u22121 < \u03b4\u03041 (K) <\n* * * < \u03b4\u0304n (K). Therefore, the result in Corollary 3.13 is strict generalization of the\npreviously known result.\nBefore we state the results concerning the behavior of the Thurston norm under\na surjective map on \u03c01 , we state and prove the following theorem which describes\nthe behavior of \u03b4\u0304n under a surjective map on \u03c01 . We only consider the case that\ndef(G) = 1 since if def(G) \u2265 2 then by Remark 2.4, r0 (G) \u2265 1.\nTheorem 3.10. Let G be either (1) a finitely presented group with def(G) = 1 or\n(2) the fundamental group of closed, connected, orientable 3-manifold. If P is a\ngroup with \u03b21 (P ) = \u03b21 (G), r0 (G) = 0, and \u03c1 : G \u0589 P is a surjective map then for\neach n \u2265 0 and \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (P ; Z),\n\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8).\nProof. We will first show that the theorem holds for primitive elements of H 1 (Y ; Z).\nIt will then follow for arbitrary elements of H 1 (Y ; Z) since for any k \u2208 Z, \u03c1\u2217 (k\u03c8) =\nk\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8), \u03b4\u0304n (k\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) = |k|\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) and \u03b4\u0304n (k\u03c8) = |k|\u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8). Let \u03c8 be a primitive\n(n+1)\n(n+1)\nelement of H 1 (P ; Z), Gn = G/Gr\n, and Pn = P/Pr\n. For each n \u2265 0, we\nhave two coefficient systems for G, \u03c61n : G \u0589 Gn and \u03c62n : G \u0589 Pn , defined by\n\u03c61n (g) = [g] and \u03c62n (g) = [\u03c1(g)]. Note that \u03c1 induces a surjection \u03c1 : Gn \u0589 Pn .\nMoreover, \u03c1 has non-trivial kernel if and only if (\u03c61n , \u03c62n , \u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) is an admissible\ntriple.\nIf \u03c1 is an isomorphism, then \u03b4\u0304Gn (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) = \u03b4\u0304Pn (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)). Suppose \u03c1 is an not\nan isomorphism. We remark that (\u03c61n , \u03c62n , \u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) is initial if and only if \u03b21 (P ) =\n1 and n = 0. However, since \u03c1 is surjective and \u03b21 (G) = \u03b21 (P ), we have \u03c1 :\n\u223c\n=\nG0 \u2212\n\u2192 P0 . Thus (\u03c61n , \u03c62n , \u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) is never inital and hence by Theorems 2.2 and\n2.9), \u03b4\u0304Gn (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304Pn (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)).\n\n\f18\n\nSHELLY L. HARVEY\n\nTo finish the proof, we will show that \u03b4\u0304Pn (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) = \u03b4\u0304Pn (\u03c8). Since \u03c1 is surjective,\nwe have a surjective map\n(n+1)\n\n\u03c1\u2217 : H1 (G; ZPn ) =\n\nPr\nker(\u03c62n )\n\u0589 (n+1) (n+1) = H1 (P ; ZPn ).\n[ker(\u03c62n ), ker(\u03c62n )]\n[Pr\n, Pr\n]\n\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nMoreover, since KP\n] is a flat (right) ZPn -module, \u03c1\u2217 : H1 (G; KP\n]) \u0589\nn [t\nn [t\nP \u00b11\nH1 (P ; Kn [t ]) is surjective.

Suppose there exists an epimorphism \u03c1 : \u03c01 (X) \u0589 \u03c01 (Y ), where\nX and Y are compact, connected, orientable 3-manifolds, with toroidal or empty\nboundaries, such that \u03b21 (X) = \u03b21 (Y ) and r0 (X) = 0. Let \u03c8 \u2208 H 1 (\u03c01 (Y ); Z). If\nany of the following conditions is satisfied\na: \u03b21 (Y ) \u2265 2 and \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = ||\u03c8||T for some n \u2265 0\nb: \u03b21 (Y ) = 1 and \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = ||\u03c8||T for some n \u2265 1\nc: \u03b21 (Y ) = 1, \u03b23 (X) \u2264 \u03b23 (Y ), \u03c8 is primitive and \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) = ||\u03c8||T + 1 + \u03b23 (Y )\nthen\n||\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 ||\u03c8||T .\nProof. Let G = \u03c01 (X) and P = \u03c01 (Y ). If X were S 1 \u00d7 D2 or S 1 \u00d7 S 2 then\n\u03c01 (X) \u223c\n= Z and \u03c01 (Y ) \u223c\n= Z hence \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = 0 for all n. Thus, we would be in\ncase b and would have ||\u03c8||T = 0 which trivially satisfies the conclusion of the\ncorollary. Therefore, we can assume that X is neither S 1 \u00d7 D2 nor S 1 \u00d7 S 2 . We\nalso remark that since r0 (X) = 0, def(\u03c01 (X)) \u2264 1 by Remark 2.4. Thus, if a\nor b is satisfied then by Theorem 10.1 of [Ha1], \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) \u2264 ||\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)||T . Hence by\nTheorem 3.10 we have ||\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8) = ||\u03c8||T . If c is satisfied then\nby Theorem 10.1 of [Ha1] we have \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) \u2264 ||\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)||T + 1 + \u03b23 (X). Therefore,\n||\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)||T \u2265 \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c1\u2217 (\u03c8)) \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b23 (X) \u2265 \u03b4\u03040 (\u03c8) \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b23 (Y ) = ||\u03c8||T .\n\u0003\nWe will now discuss the case when G is the fundamental group of a knot complement.\nCorollary 3.12. If J and K are knots in S 3 such that there exists a surjective\nhomomorphism \u03c1 : \u03c01 (S 3 \\ L) \u0589 \u03c01 (S 3 \\ K) then for each n \u2265 0, \u03b4\u0304n (L) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (K).\nProof.

Since \u03c1 is surjective and \u03b21 (S 3 \u2212 L) = 1, \u03c8G\nis a generator of H 1 (S 3 \u2212 L; Z). By [COT, Proposition 2.11 ], r0 (G) = 0 hence by\nTheorem 3.10, \u03b4\u0304n (L) = \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8G ) \u2265 \u03b4\u0304n (\u03c8P ) = \u03b4\u0304n (K).\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.13.

Instead of omitting\nany proof, we will supply a proof which is a simplified version of the proof of\nCorollary 3.11.\nProof. We can assume that L is not the unknot since \u03c6 is surjective.
