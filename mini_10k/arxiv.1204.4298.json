The following\nnotation and terminology are needed in the sequel. Let u \u2208 V and v \u2208 V be two distinct\nvertices of a graph G = (V, E). The distance between u and v in G, denoted by d(u, v), is\nthe length of a shortest path connecting them in G. A (u, v)-path is a path with initial\nvertex u and terminal vertex v, denoted by P [u, v]. Let PH [u, v] denote the path in H\nconnecting u and v, where H is the subgraph of G. For two subsets U and W of V ,\na (U, W )-path is a path which starts at a vertex of U and ends at a vertex of W , and\n\u2217\n\nSupported by NSFC No.11071130.\n\n1\n\n\fwhose internal vertices belong to neither U nor W . We use E[U, W ] to denote the set of\nedges of G with one end in U and the other end in W , and e(U, W ) = |E[U, W ]|. Let\nG[U] denote the subgraph of G whose vertex set is U and whose edge set consists of all\nsuch edges of G that have both ends in U. The following notions are from [13]. A set\nD \u2286 V (G) is called a k-step connected dominating set of G, if every vertex in G \\ D is at\na distance at most k from D, where G[D] is connected. The k-step open neighborhood\nof a set D is N k (D) := {x \u2208 V (G)|d(x, D) = k}, where k \u2208 N. We often use e(G) to\ndenote the number of edges in a graph G and |G| to denote the order of G. For undefined\nterminology and notation, we refer to [1].\nLet G = (V, E) be a connected graph with vertex set V and edge set E. A k-edge\ncoloring of G is a mapping c : E \u2192 C, where C is a set of k distinct colors. In [8]\nChartrand, Johns, McKeon and Zhang introduced a new concept about the connectivity\nand coloring of a graph, which is given follows. A path of G is called rainbow if every\nedge of it is colored by a distinct color. For every two vertices u and v of G, if there\nexists a rainbow path between them, we say that G is rainbow connected. The rainbow\nconnection number rc(G) is defined as the smallest number of colors that are needed to\nmake G rainbow connected. An edge coloring is called a rainbow coloring if it makes\nG rainbow connected. From the definition of rainbow connection, we can see that the\ndiameter diam(G) \u2264 rc(G) \u2264 e(G). For more knowledge on the rainbow connection, we\nrefer to [15, 14].\nIn [5] Chakraborty, Fischer, Matsliah and Yuster showed that given a graph G, deciding if rc(G) = 2 is NP-complete, in particular, computing rc(G) is NP-hard, which were\nconjectured by Caro, Lev, Roditty, Tuza and Yuster [4]. So, to obtain upper bounds for\nthe rainbow connection number rc(G) of a graph G becomes interesting. Therefore, many\ngood upper bounds have been obtained in terms of other graph parameters. Caro, Lev,\nRoditty, Tuza and Yuster[4] conjectured that if G is a connected graph with n vertices\nand \u03b4(G) \u2265 3, then rc(G) < 34 n. Schhiermeyer [21] confirmed the conjecture and showed\n, and\nthat if G is a connected graph with n vertices and \u03b4(G) \u2265 3, then rc(G) \u2264 3n\u22121\n4\n3\nthere are examples to show that 4 cannot be replaced with a smaller constant. In [6]\nChandran, Das, Rajendraprasad and Varma obtained a good relation between the rainbow connection number and the minimum degree of a graph. They showed that if G is a\nconnected graph of order n and minimum degree \u03b4(G), then rc(G) \u2264 3n/(\u03b4(G) + 1) + 3,\nand the bound is tight up to addictive factors. Later, we [10] studied the relation between\nthe rainbow connection number and the minimum degree sum, a generalized result of\nthe minimum degree version. We showed that if G is a graph with k independent ver3kn\n+ 6k \u2212 3. In [3], Basavaraju, Chandran, Rajendraprasad and\ntices, then rc(G) \u2264 \u03c3k (G)+k\nRamaswamy investigated the relation between the rainbow connection number and the\nradius of a bridgeless graph. They showed that for every bridgeless graph G with radius\nrad(G), rc(G) \u2264 rad(G)(rad(G) + 2), and gave an example to show that the bound is\ntight. In [7] Li, Liu, Chandran, Mathew and Rajendraprasad showed that if G is a 2connected graph of order n (n \u2265 3), then rc(G) \u2264 \u2308 n2 \u2309, and the upper bound is tight for\nn \u2265 4. Later, Ekstein et al. [11] got the same result. Li et al. [7] also got some relations\n2\n\n\fbetween the rainbow connection number and the connectivity of a graph. Schiermeyer\n[20] obtained a relation between the rainbow connection number of a graph G and the\nchromatic number of the complement of G, i.e., rc(G) \u2264 2\u03c7(\u1e20) \u2212 1.\nThis paper intends to give a relation between the rainbow connection number and\nthe independence number of a graph. Recall that an independent set of a graph G is a\nset of vertices such that any two of these vertices are non-adjacent in G. The independence number \u03b1(G) of G is the cardinality of a maximum independent set of G. The\nindependence number of a graph is an important parameter, and the investigation on the\nrelations between the independence number and other graph parameters is interesting,\nsee [2, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19]. We obtain the following result.\nTheorem 1 If G is a connected graph, then rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1, and the bound is the\nbest possible.\nTwo examples are given to show that our bound 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1 is exactly equal to the\ndiameter of G, and therefore our bound is the best possible since the diameter is a lower\nbound of rc(G). Moreover, for these examples some good bounds in terms of other\nparameters can be arbitrarily bad. As we know, even for the chromatic number, every\nupper bound is attained yet arbitrarily bad for many graphs. We also give an example,\nExample 3, to show that our result rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1 could be arbitrarily bad. This\nexample also shows that the bounds in terms of other parameters are arbitrarily bad.\nExample 1: Let P2t = v1 v2 v3 * * * v2t\u22121 v2t be a path of length 2t\u22121, and let G1 , G2 , * * * , Gt\nbe t (t \u2265 2) complete graphs with |G1 | = 2 and |Gi | = s for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 t. For every\ni with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, we join each vertex of Gi to every vertex of v2i\u22121 and v2i . The\nobtained graph is denoted by G. One can see that G is connected with \u03b4(G) = 3, and\nI(G) = {v2 , v4 , v6 , * * * , v2t } is a maximum independent set, that is, \u03b1(G) = t. We also\nknow that the distance d(v1 , v2t ) = 2t \u2212 1. So, rc(G) \u2265 2t \u2212 1. Now we use 2t \u2212 1 distinct\ncolors to give G an edge coloring. Let 1, 2, * * * , 2t \u2212 1 be 2t \u2212 1 distinct colors. We use the\n2t \u2212 1 colors to color all the edges of P2t , and each edge with a distinct color. Thus, P2t is\nrainbow connected. Then we use color 2i \u2212 1 to color every edge of E[V (Gi ), {v2i\u22121 , v2i }].\nFinally, we use color 1 to color every edge of G[V (Gi )]. One can show that G is rainbow\nconnected. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (Gi , P2t ), either the edge uv2i together with the path in\nP2t connecting v2i and v forms a rainbow path, or the edge uv2i\u22121 together with the path\nin P2t connecting v2i\u22121 and v forms a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (Gi , Gj ) with\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 t, the edges uv2i and vv2j\u22121 together with the path in P2t connecting v2i and\nv2j\u22121 form a rainbow path. So, G is rainbow connected, and hence rc(G) \u2264 2t \u2212 1. Thus,\nrc(G) = 2t \u2212 1 = 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1. Note that, diam(G) = 2t \u2212 1, rad(G) = t, \u03b4(G) = 3 and for\nany v \u2208 V (G) \\ ({v1 , v2 } \u222a V (G1 )), the degree of v is at least s + 1.\nThe following facts can be easily seen. When s is very large, the order n of G is very\nlarge. The upper bounds in [6, 21] can be arbitrarily bad, because 3n/(\u03b4(G) + 1) + 3 =\n3n/4 + 3 and 3n\u22121\n, both bounds are large by selecting s to be large; When k \u2265 2,\n4\n3\n\n\f3kn\n3kn\n\u03c3k (G) \u2265 3 + s + 1, the bound in [10] is \u03c3k (G)+k\n+ 6k \u2212 3 \u2264 s+4+k\n+ 6k \u2212 3, better than\nthe bounds of [6, 21], when s is very large, but it is also far from the diameter of G;\nThe bound in [3] is rad(G)(rad(G) + 2) = t(t + 2), a square of t. However, our result\nrc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1 is the best, which is equal to diam(G).\n\nExample 2: For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2t (t \u2265 2), let the sets V1 , V2 , * * * , V2t be pairwise disjoint,\n|V1 | = |V2 | = 2 and for i \u2265 3, |Vi | = s (s \u2265 2). Join each vertex of Vi to every vertex of\nVi+1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2t \u2212 1. Suppose that every two vertices of Vi are adjacent for each i. We\ndenote the resulting graph by G. Note that, G is 2-connected, \u03b1(G) = t, diam(G) = 2t\u22121\nand rad(G) = t. For any vertex v \u2208 V1 , the degree of v is 3, for any vertex v \u2208 V2 , the\ndegree of v is s + 3, for any vertex v \u2208 V \\ {V1 , V2 , V2t }, the degree of v is 3s \u2212 1, and for\nany vertex v \u2208 V2t , the degree of v is 2s \u2212 1. Color each edge in E[Vi , Vi+1 ] with color i\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2t \u2212 1 and each edge in G[Vi ] with color 1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2t. It is not difficult to\ncheck that rc(G) = 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1 = 2t \u2212 1 = diam(G).\nOne can see the following facts. When s is very large, the order n of G is very large.\nThe upper bounds in [6, 7, 21] can be arbitrarily bad, because 3n/(\u03b4(G)+1)+3 = 3n/4+3,\n\u2308 n2 \u2309 and 3n\u22121\nare all large by selecting s to be large; When s is very large, the bound in\n4\n3kn\n3kn\n+ 6k \u2212 3, better than the bounds of [6, ?], but it is also far\n[10] is \u03c3k (G)+k + 6k \u2212 3 \u2264 s+6+k\nfrom diam(G). The bound in [3] is rad(G)(rad(G) + 2) = t(t + 2), a square of t, far from\ndiam(G). However, our result rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1 is the best, which is equal to diam(G).\nExample 3: Consider the graph G = K1,1,s with partition sets V1 , V2 and V3 , and\n|V1 | = |V2 | = 1, and |V3 | = s (s > 3). Then G is 2-connected, \u03b4(G) = 2, \u03b1(G) = s.\nand rc(G) = 3. We can see that the upper bounds of [6, 7, 21] and our result can be\narbitrarily bad, because 3n/(\u03b4(G) + 1) + 3 = 3n/4 + 3, 3n\u22121\n, \u2308 n2 \u2309 and 2s \u2212 1 are very large\n4\nby selecting s to be large.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nBefore proving our main result, we first prove a lemma. Although this lemma can be\nfound in [6], here we use a new technique to give it another proof.\nLemma 1 Let G be a connected graph with \u03b4(G) \u2265 2, and let D be a connected dominating\nset of G. Then rc(G) \u2264 rc(G[D]) + 3.\nProof. At first, we use rc(G[D]) different colors to give G[D] a rainbow coloring. Then,\nlet 1, 2 and 3 be three distinct fresh colors. Since D is a connected dominating set of G,\nV (G) = D \u222a N(D). We will perform the following procedure:\nProcedure 1:\nF = N(D), i = 1,\nwhile there exists a vertex wi \u2208 F with dG[F ] (wi ) \u2265 1 do\n4\n\n\fHi = N[wi ] \u2229 F , F = F \\ Hi ,\ni = i + 1.\nWhile the above procedure ends, we get an empty graph G[F ], and a sequence of vertices\nw1 , w2 , * * * , wt and a sequence of sets H1 , H2 , * * * , Ht . So, we have partitioned N(D)\ninto some disjoint subsets H1 , H2 , * * * , Ht , F . Now we will give colors to the remaining\nuncolored edges of G. We use color 1 to color every edge in E[wi , D], and use color 2 to\ncolor every edge in G[N(D)]. Finally, we use color 3 to color every edge in E[Hi \\{wi }, D].\nIt is not difficult to check that G is rainbow connected.\nBefore giving the proof of Theorem 1, we need the following observation.\nObservation. Let G be a graph. If G has a cut edge uv, then we replace uv by a clique\nof order at least 3, i.e., we add to G some new vertices w1 , w2 . . . , wq with q \u2265 1 such that\nu, v, w1, . . . , wq form a complete subgraph. The new graph is denoted by G\u2032 , and is called\na blow-up graph of G at the cut edge uv. It is not difficult to check that rc(G\u2032 ) = rc(G)\nand \u03b1(G\u2032 ) = \u03b1(G). In this way, we need only to consider graphs without any cut edge,\nand therefore without any pendant edge, i.e., its minimum degree is at least 2.\nProof of Theorem 1. If G is a complete graph, then \u03b1(G) = 1 and rc(G) = 1, Theorem\n1 follows. Now assume that G is a non-complete graph with \u03b4(G) \u2265 2.\nWe will perform the following procedure to obtain a tree T whose vertex set D is\na connected dominating set of G. Let y0 \u2208 V (G) with d(y0 ) = \u03b4(G). Since G is a\nnon-complete graph, N 2 (y0 ) 6= \u2205. We look at the following procedure:\nProcedure 2:\nD = {y0 }, T = y0 , X = \u03c6, Y = {y0 }.\nWhile N 2 (D) 6= \u03c6\ntake any vertex v \u2208 N 2 (D), let P = vhu be a path of length 2,\nwhere h \u2208 N 1 (D) and u \u2208 D. Let D = D \u222a V (P ),\nT = T \u222a P , X = X \u222a {h}, Y = Y \u222a {v}.\nIf u \u2208 X, we call u an X-knot vertex. Note that N 2 (D) does not contain any neighbor\nof Y . When the above procedure ends, the algorithm runs |X| rounds. Thus we get\nV (G) = D\u222aN 1 (D), where D is a connected dominating set. Note that Y is an independent\nset and |Y | = |X| + 1. So |Y | \u2264 \u03b1(G) and |D| = |Y | + |X| = 2|Y | \u2212 1. Note that T is a\nspanning tree of G[D] and the pendant vertices of T are all in Y , and also note that if x\nis an X-knot vertex, then x is adjacent to at least three vertices of T .\nIn the following, D, T , Y and X are always the same as those obtained in the above\nalgorithm. In order to continue our proof, we need the following lemmas.\nLemma 2 If there exists a vertex w \u2208 N 1 (D) such that e(w, Y ) = 0, then rc(G) \u2264\n2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nProof. Let I = Y \u222a{w}. Then I is an independent set and |I| = |Y |+1. So |Y | = |I|\u22121 \u2264\n\u03b1(G) \u2212 1. By Lemma 1, we can get that rc(G) \u2264 rc(G[D]) + 3 \u2264 |D| + 2 = 2|Y | + 1.\n5\n\n\fHence, rc(G) \u2264 2(\u03b1(G) \u2212 1) + 1 = 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nFrom the proof of Lemmas 2, we can see that if we can find an independent set I\nsatisfying |I| = |Y | + 1, then we will get rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nLemma 3 If G[D] = T and there exist two vertices w, w \u2032 \u2208 N 1 (D) such that ww \u2032 6\u2208 E(G),\ne(w, Y ) = 1, e(w \u2032 , Y ) = 1, e(w, X) = 0 and e(w \u2032 , X) = 0, then rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nProof. Let wy \u2208 E(G) and w \u2032 y \u2032 \u2208 E(G) where y \u2208 D and y \u2032 \u2208 D. Since G[D] = T , let\nPT [y, y \u2032] denote the only path connecting y and y \u2032 in T . If there do not exist two successive\nvertices of X in PT [y, y \u2032], then let I = {w, w \u2032}\u222a(V (PT [y, y \u2032])\u2229X)\u222a(Y \\(V (PT [y, y \u2032])\u2229Y )).\nOne can see that I is an independent set and |I| = |Y | + 1, and so rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nOtherwise, suppose that there exist two successive vertices of X in PT [y, y \u2032]. By the\nstructure of T , we can conclude that there must be an X-knot vertex between the two\nsuccessive vertices. Then there must be a segment in PT [y, y \u2032], without loss of generality,\nsay PT [y, x] \u2282 PT [y, y \u2032], where x is an X-knot vertex, and in PT [y, x] there is an vertex\nx\u2032 of X adjacent to x, and x\u2032 , x are the only two successive vertices in PT [y, x]. Then\nI = {w}\u222a(V (PT [y, x\u2032 ])\u2229X)\u222a(Y \\V (PT [y, x\u2032 ])\u2229Y ) is an independent set and |I| = |Y |+1.\nSo rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nLemma 4 If G[D] = T and there exist vertices w1 , w2 \u2208 N 1 (D) and y1 , y2 \u2208 D such that\nw1 w2 6\u2208 E(G), and N(w1 ) \u2229 D = N(w2 ) \u2229 D = {y, y \u2032}, then rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1 \u2212 1.\nProof. Let PT [y, y \u2032] denote the only path connecting y and y \u2032 in T . If there do not exist\ntwo successive vertices of X in PT [y, y \u2032], then let I = {w1 , w2 } \u222a (V (PT [y, y \u2032]) \u2229 X) \u222a (Y \\\n(V (PT [y, y \u2032]) \u2229 Y )). One can see that I is an independent set and |I| = |Y | + 1, and so\nrc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1. Otherwise, there must exist two successive vertices of X in PT [y, y \u2032].\nBy the structure of T , we can conclude that there must be an X-knot vertex between\nthe two successive vertices. Then there must be a segment in PT [y, y \u2032], without loss of\ngenerality, say PT [y, x] \u2282 PT [y, y \u2032], where x is an X-knot vertex, and in PT [y, x] there is\nan vertex x\u2032 of X adjacent to x, and x\u2032 , x are the only two successive vertices in PT [y, x].\nThen I = {w, w \u2032} \u222a (V (PT [y, x\u2032 ]) \u2229 X) \u222a ((Y \\ ((V (PT [y, x\u2032 ]) \u2229 Y ) \u222a {y \u2032 }) is an independent\nset and |I| = |Y | + 1. So rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nLet N 1 (D) = A \u222a B where w \u2208 A if and only if e(w, D) \u2265 2, and w \u2208 B if and only\nif e(w, D) = 1. By Lemma 2, we can get that every vertex w \u2208 B satisfies e(w, X) = 0,\nand so e(w, Y ) = 1. By Lemma 3, we can get that G[B] is a complete subgraph. In the\nfollowing we will divide two cases to finish our proof.\nCase 1. e(G[D]) \u2265 e(T ) + 1.\nLet a1 a2 \u2208 E(G[D]) and a1 a2 \u2208\n6 E(T ). Note that T is a spanning tree of G[D].\nSo T \u222a a1 a2 contains a cycle, say C, and a1 a2 \u2208 E(C). Let G\u2032 = T \u222a a1 a2 . Then\n6\n\n\frc(G[D]) \u2264 rc(G\u2032 ). Since rc(G\u2032 ) \u2264 e(T ) \u2212 (|C| \u2212 1) + rc(C) and rc(C) \u2264 \u2308 |C|\n\u2309 when\n2\n|C| \u2265 4, we can get\n\uf8f1\n|C|\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 e(T ) \u2212 2 + 1, |C| is even\nrc(G\u2032 ) \u2264\ne(T ) \u2212 |C|\u22123\n,\n|C| is odd and |C| =\n6 3\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 e(T ) \u2212 1,\n|C| = 3\n\nHence, rc(G[D]) \u2264 rc(G\u2032 ) \u2264 e(T ) \u2212 1.\n\nNow we color every edge of G in the following way. First, we use rc(G[D]) distinct\ncolors to rainbow color G[D]. Then let c\u2032 , c\u2032\u2032 be two fresh colors. For any vertex w \u2208 A,\nlet w \u2032, w \u2032\u2032 \u2208 D with ww \u2032, ww \u2032\u2032 \u2208 E(G), set c(ww \u2032) = c\u2032 and c(ww \u2032\u2032) = c\u2032\u2032 . For any vertex\nb \u2208 B, let b\u2032 \u2208 D with bb\u2032 \u2208 E(G), set c(bb\u2032 ) = c\u2032 . For the remaining uncolored edges of\nE(G), we use a used color to color them. Thus we have colored all the edges of G.\nWe will show that G is rainbow connected. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (N(D) \u00d7 D), the\nedge uu\u2032 together with the path in G\u2032 connecting u\u2032 and v forms a rainbow path, where\nc(uu\u2032) = c\u2032 and u\u2032 \u2208 D. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A \u00d7 A), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032\u2032 together\nwith the path in G\u2032 connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032\u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032 ) = c\u2032 and\nc(vv \u2032\u2032 ) = c\u2032\u2032 . For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A \u00d7 B), the edges uu\u2032\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path\nin G\u2032 connecting u\u2032\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032\u2032 ) = c\u2032\u2032 and c(vv \u2032 ) = c\u2032 . Thus\nwe have showed that G is rainbow connected.\nIn the above coloring, we used at most rc(G[D]) + 2 \u2264 e(T ) + 1 colors. Hence,\nrc(G) \u2264 e(T ) + 1, that is rc(G) \u2264 |D|. Since |D| = 2|Y | \u2212 1 \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1, we can get\nrc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nCase 2. e(G[D]) = e(T ).\nLet 1, 2, c1 , c2 and a be 5 distinct colors, and in the following proof, we use a to color\neach edge of E[B, D], and use c1 to color each edge of E(G[B]).\nChoose a longest path P in G[D] such that two ends of P are pendant vertices. We\nknow that the two pendant vertices belong to Y , and |P | \u2265 3. Let P = y1 x1 x2 * * * xk y2 .\nWe look at two subcases:\nSubcase 2.1. V (P ) \u2282 D.\nSince P is a longest path and |Y | = |X| + 1, we can get |P | \u2265 4. Choose a pendant\nedge in T , say y3 x, which is not in P . Let P \u2032 be a path passing through y3 x in T\nwith |V (P ) \u2229 V (P \u2032)| = 1, and let V (P ) \u2229 V (P \u2032 ) = {x\u2032 }. Without loss of generality, let\n|P [y1, x\u2032 ]| \u2265 3, and let c(y1 x1 ) = 1, c(x1 x2 ) = c1 , c(xk y2 ) = 2 and c(xy3 ) = c2 .\nLet A1 , A2 , A3 and A4 be the subsets of A. w1 \u2208 A1 if and only if w1 y1 \u2208 E(G) and\nw1 is adjacent to only one vertex of D \\ {y1 , y2}. Let c(w1 y1 ) = c2 and c(w1 w1\u2032 ) = 2 where\nw1\u2032 \u2208 D; w2 \u2208 A2 if and only if w2 y2 \u2208 E(G) and w2 is adjacent to only one vertex of\nD \\ {y1 , y2 }. Let c(w2 y2 ) = c2 and c(w2 w2\u2032 ) = 1 where w2\u2032 \u2208 D; w3 \u2208 A3 if and only if\n7\n\n\fw3 y1 \u2208 E(G), w3 y2 \u2208 E(G) and e(w3 , D) = 2. Let c(w3 y1 ) = 2 and c(w3 y2 ) = 1. w4 \u2208 A4\nif and only if w4 is adjacent to at least two vertices w4\u2032 and w4\u2032\u2032 of D \\ {y1 , y2 }. Assume\nthat the distance between w4\u2032 and y1 in T is not more than the distance between w4\u2032\u2032 and\ny1 in T . Let c(w4 w4\u2032 ) = a and c(w4 w4\u2032\u2032 ) = 1. Let B1 , B2 and B3 be the subsets of B.\nb1 \u2208 B1 if and only if b1 is only adjacent to y1 ; b2 \u2208 B2 if and only if b2 is only adjacent\nto y2 ; b3 \u2208 B3 if and only if b3 is only adjacent to some vertex of Y \\ {y1, y2 }. Thus we\nget A = A1 \u222a A2 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 , B = B1 \u222a B2 \u222a B3 . From Lemma 4 we know that G[A3 ] is\na complete subgraph, and from Lemma 3 we get that G[B] is a complete subgraph. It is\neasy to check that for any vertex of N(D) is rainbow connection to any vertex of D.\nSubsubcase 2.1.1. B1 6= \u03c6, B2 6= \u03c6 and B3 6= \u03c6.\nFirst, we will show that G[A1 ], G[A2 ] and G[A4 ] is rainbow connected, respectively.\nFor each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A1 ), let u\u2032 , v \u2032 \u2208 D with uu\u2032, vv \u2032 \u2208 E(G), if u\u2032 6= v \u2032 , then\nwithout loss of generality, we assume that the path in T from v \u2032 to y1 does not contain\nthe edge y3 x. Thus the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting y1 and\nv \u2032 form a rainbow path between u and v; if u\u2032 = v \u2032 and v \u2032 y2 \u2208 E(G), then the edges\nuy1 and vy2 together with the path P form a rainbow path between u and v; if u\u2032 = v \u2032\nand u\u2032 y2 \u2208 E(G), similarly, there is a rainbow path between them; if u\u2032 = v \u2032 and assume\nthat v \u2032 y2 6\u2208 E(G) and u\u2032 y2 6\u2208 E(G), then from Lemma 4, we can get uv \u2208 E(G). So for\neach pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A1 ), there is a rainbow path connecting them. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A2 ), similar to (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A1 ), we can get a rainbow path between u\nand v; For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A4 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in\nT connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = a and c(vv \u2032) = 1.\nSecond, we will show that for any vertex u \u2208 A1 , there is a rainbow path connecting\nit to any vertex of A2 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 (A2 \u222a A4 )), the edges\nuu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where\nc(uu\u2032) = 2 and c(vv \u2032 ) = 1. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A3 ), uy1v is a rainbow path. For\neach pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B1 ), uy1v is a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B2 ),\nthe edges uy1 and vy2 together with the path P form a rainbow path. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B3 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and\nv \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 2 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a.\nThird, we will show that for any vertex u \u2208 A2 , there is a rainbow path connecting\nit to any vertex of A3 \u222a A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A4 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032\ntogether with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 1\nand c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A3 ), uy2 v is a rainbow path. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B1 ), the edges uy2 and vy1 together with the path P form a rainbow path.\nFor each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B2 ), uy2 v is a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B3 ),\nthe edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow\npath, where c(uu\u2032) = 1 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a.\nFourth, we will show that for any vertex u \u2208 A3 , there is a rainbow path connecting\nit to any vertex of A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 A4 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032\n8\n\n\ftogether with the path in T connecting y1 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uy1 ) = 2\nand c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B1 ), uy1v is a rainbow path. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B2 ), uy2 v is a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B3 ), the edges\nuy1 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting y1 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path.\nFinally, we will show that for any vertex u \u2208 A4 , there is a rainbow path connecting\nit to any vertex of B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B1 ), the edges uu\u2032, vb2 and b2 y2\ntogether with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and y2 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032 ) = 1\nand b2 \u2208 B2 . For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B2 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy2 together with the\npath in T connecting u\u2032 and y2 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 1. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B3 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and\nv \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 1 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a.\nThus, we have proved that G is rainbow connected.\nFrom the proof above, we can see the following facts: for any vertex of A there is a\nrainbow path connecting it to any vertex of G, and the internal vertex of the rainbow\npath does not contain any vertex of B; for any vertex of B2 , there is a rainbow path\nconnecting it to any vertex of G, and the rainbow path does not contain any vertex of\nB1 \u222a B3 ; for any vertex of B3 , there is a rainbow path connecting it to any vertex of G,\nand the rainbow path does not contain any vertex of B1 \u222a B2 . Hence, in the following\nproof, we can assume that B3 = \u03c6 and B2 = \u03c6.\nSubsubcase 2.1.2. B1 6= \u03c6.\nWe still use the above mentioned subsets A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 and B1 , and we still color\nthe edges of G in the above way except for setting c(w4 w4\u2032 ) = a and c(w4 w4\u2032\u2032 ) = 2. Thus\nwe only need to show that for any vertex of A4 , there is a rainbow path connecting it to\nany vertex of G. We will give the proof as follows. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A4 ), the\nedges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path,\nwhere c(uu\u2032) = a and c(vv \u2032) = 2. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A3 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy1\ntogether with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and y1 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = a.\nFor each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A2 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T\nconnecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = a and c(vv \u2032) = 1. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A1 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032\nform a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = a and c(vv \u2032) = 2. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B1 ),\nthe edges uu\u2032 and vy1 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and y1 form a rainbow\npath, where c(uu\u2032) = 2. Hence, we have showed that G is rainbow connected.\nSubcase 2.2. V (P ) = D.\nSince V (P ) = D and |Y | = |X| + 1, P is a (Y, X)-alternate path. Let A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 ,\nB1 , B2 and B3 be the above mentioned subsets.\nSubsubcase 2.2.1. |P | = 3.\n\n9\n\n\fLet P = y1 x1 y2 . We use color 1 to color edge y1 x1 and use color 2 to color y2 x1 . Let\nA1 , A2 , A3 , B1 and B2 be the above mentioned subsets. Note that: A4 = \u03c6, B3 = \u03c6,\nG[A1 \u222a B1 ] is a complete subgraph, and G[A2 \u222a B2 ] is a complete subgraph. For any\nw1 \u2208 A1 and w2 \u2208 A2 , let c(w1 y1 ) = a, c(w1 x1 ) = 1, c(w2 y2 ) = a and c(w2 x1 ) = 2. It\nis obvious that for each vertex of A \u222a B, there is a rainbow path connecting it to any\nvertex of P . For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A2 ), ux1 v is a rainbow path. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A3 ), uy1v is a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B2 ), ux1 y2 v is\na rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A3 ), uy2v is a rainbow path. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B1 ), ux1 y1 v is a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B1 ), uy1v is a\nrainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B2 ), uy2 v is a rainbow path. Thus, we have\nshowed that G is rainbow connected.\nSubsubcase 2.2.2. |P | \u2265 5.\nLet c(y1 x1 ) = 1, c(x1 y1\u2032 ) = c1 , c(y2 x2 ) = 2 and c(x2 y2\u2032 ) = c2 where y1\u2032 , y2\u2032 \u2208 V (P ). We\ncolor the edges of G in the following way: We use a to color each edge of E[B, D], and\nuse c1 to color each edge of G[B]. For any w1 \u2208 A1 , let c(w1 y1 ) = 2 and c(w1 w1\u2032 ) = a\nwhere w1\u2032 \u2208 D; For any w2 \u2208 A2 , let c(w2 y2 ) = 1 and c(w2 w2\u2032 ) = a where w2\u2032 \u2208 D;\nFor any w3 \u2208 A3 , let c(w3 y1 ) = 2 and c(w3 y2 ) = 1; For any w4 \u2208 A4 , assume that the\ndistance between w4\u2032 and y1 in P is not more than the distance between w4\u2032\u2032 and y1 in P ,\nlet c(w4 w4\u2032 ) = a and c(w4 w4\u2032\u2032 ) = 1 where w4\u2032 , w4\u2032\u2032 \u2208 D. We will divide three cases to show\nthat G is rainbow connected.\nSubsubsubcase 2.2.2.1. B1 6= \u03c6, B2 6= \u03c6 and B3 6= \u03c6.\nFirst, we can easily check that for each vertex of A \u222a B, there is a rainbow path\nconnecting it to any vertex of P .\nSecond, we will show that G[A1 ], G[A2 ] and G[A4 ] are rainbow connected, respectively.\nFor each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A1 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T\nconnecting y1 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uy1 ) = 2 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a; For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A2 ), the edges uy2 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting y2 and v \u2032\nform a rainbow path, where c(uy2) = 1 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a; For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A4 ),\nthe edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow\npath, where c(uu\u2032) = 1 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a.\nThird, we will show that for each vertex of A1 , there is a rainbow path connecting\nit to any vertex of A2 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A2 ), the edges uu\u2032\nand vy2 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and y2 form a rainbow path, where\nc(uu\u2032) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A3 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy1 together with the\npath in T connecting u\u2032 and y1 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032 ) = a. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A4 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting y1 and v \u2032\nform a rainbow path, where c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7B1 ), uy1 v is a rainbow\npath. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B2 ), uy1 b1 v is a rainbow path, where b1 \u2208 B1 . For each\npair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B3 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting y1\nand v \u2032 form a rainbow path.\n10\n\n\fFourth, we will show that for each vertex of A2 , there is a rainbow path connecting it to\nany vertex of A3 \u222aA4 \u222aB. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7A3 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy1 together\nwith the path in T connecting u\u2032 and y1 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = a. For each\npair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A4 ), the edges uy2 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting y2\nand v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(vv \u2032) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B1 ), uy2 b2 v\nis a rainbow path, where b2 \u2208 B2 . For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B2 ), uy2 v is a rainbow\npath. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B3 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together with the path in\nT connecting y1 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path.\nFifth, we will show that for each vertex of A3 , there is a rainbow path connecting it\nto any vertex of A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 A4 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together\nwith the path in T connecting y1 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each\npair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B1 ), uy1 v is a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B2 ), uy2 v\nis a rainbow path. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A3 \u00d7 B3 ), the edges uy1 and vv \u2032 together with\nthe path in T connecting y1 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path.\nFinally, we will show that for each vertex of A4 , there is a rainbow path connecting it\nto any vertex of B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B1 ), the edges uu\u2032 , vb2 and b2 y2 together\nwith the path in T connecting y2 and u\u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032 ) = 1. For each\npair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B2 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy2 together with the path in T connecting\nu\u2032 and y2 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032 ) = 1. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B3 ), the\nedges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path,\nwhere c(uu\u2032) = 1.\nHence, we have showed that G is rainbow connected.\nFrom the proof above, we can see the following facts: for any vertex of A there is a\nrainbow path connecting it to any vertex of G, and the internal vertex of the rainbow\npath does not contain any vertex of B; for any vertex of B3 , there is a rainbow path\nconnecting it to any vertex of G, and the rainbow path does not contain any vertex of\nB1 \u222a B2 . Hence, in the following proof we can assume that B3 = \u03c6.\nSubsubsubcase 2.2.2.2. B1 = \u03c6 and B2 6= \u03c6.\nWe still make use of the above coloring way except for the edges of E[A1 , D]. We now\ncolor the edges of E[A1 , D] as follows: For any vertex w1 \u2208 A1 , if w1 x1 \u2208 E(G), then\nlet c(w1 y1 ) = a and c(w1 x1 ) = 1; if w1 x1 6\u2208 E(G), then let w1\u2032 \u2208 D \\ {y1 , x1 , y2} with\nw1 w1\u2032 \u2208 E(G), and let P [y1, w1\u2032 ] be a subpath of P , z \u2208 V (P [y1 , w1\u2032 ]) with zw1\u2032 \u2208 E(G),\nthen let c(w1 y1 ) = c(zw1\u2032 ), c(w1 w1\u2032 ) = 1. From the coloring, one can easily check that\nG[A1 ] is rainbow connected.\nNow, we show that for each vertex of A1 , there is a rainbow path connecting it to any\nvertex of A2 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 (A2 \u222a A4 )), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032\ntogether with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 1\nand c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 A3 ), uy1 v is a rainbow path. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A1 \u00d7 B2 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy2 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and\n11\n\n\fy2 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 1.\nThus we have proved that G is rainbow connected.\nSubsubcase 2.2.2.3 B1 6= \u03c6 and B2 = \u03c6.\nWe still make use of the above coloring way except for the edges of E[A2 , D] and the\nedges of E[A4 , D]. For any vertex w4 \u2208 A4 , we let c(w4 w4\u2032 ) = a and c(w4 w4\u2032\u2032 ) = 2. For any\nvertex w2 \u2208 A2 , we will color the edges of E[A2 , D] in the following way: If w2 x2 \u2208 E(G),\nthen let c(w2 y2 ) = a and c(w2 x2 ) = 2; If w2 x2 6\u2208 E(G), then let w2\u2032 \u2208 D \\ {y1 , x2 , y2 } with\nw2 w2\u2032 \u2208 E(G), and let P [y2 , w2\u2032 ] be a subpath of P , z \u2032 \u2208 V (P [y2, w2\u2032 ]) with z \u2032 w2\u2032 \u2208 E(G),\nthen let c(w2 y2 ) = c(z \u2032 w2\u2032 ). One can easily check that G[A2 ] and G[A4 ] are rainbow\nconnected, respectively.\nThen, we will show that for each vertex of A2 , there is a rainbow path connecting it\nto any vertex of A1 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 (A1 \u222a A4 )), the edges\nuu\u2032 and vv \u2032 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where\nc(uu\u2032) = 2 and c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 A3 ), uy2 v is a rainbow path. For\neach pair (u, v) \u2208 (A2 \u00d7 B1 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy1 together with the path in T connecting\nu\u2032 and y1 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 2.\nFinally, we will show that for each vertex of A4 , there is a rainbow path connecting\nit to any vertex of A1 \u222a A3 \u222a B. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A1 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vv \u2032\ntogether with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and v \u2032 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 2\nand c(vv \u2032 ) = a. For each pair (u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 A3 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy1 together with\nthe path in T connecting u\u2032 and y1 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = a. For each pair\n(u, v) \u2208 (A4 \u00d7 B1 ), the edges uu\u2032 and vy1 together with the path in T connecting u\u2032 and\ny1 form a rainbow path, where c(uu\u2032) = 2.\nThus we have proved that G is rainbow connected.\nIn the above coloring, we used e(T ) + 1 colors. Hence, rc(G) \u2264 e(T ) + 1, and so we\ncan get rc(G) \u2264 2\u03b1(G) \u2212 1.\nCombining the above Cases 1 and 2, we have completed the proof of Theorem 1.\nSince the independence number \u03b1(G) is at most the number of cliques that partition\nthe vertex set of a graph G, and the minimum of such partitions is the chromatic number\nof the complement \u1e20 of G, we can get the following corollary, which is Theorem 10 of\n[20].\nCorollary 1 (Theorem 10, [20] ) Let G be a connected graph with chromatic number\n\u03c7(G). Then rc(G) \u2264 2\u03c7(\u1e20) \u2212 1.\nAcknowledgement.
