Introdu tion\n\nUltra old neutrons an be stored in material bottles for times approa hing the beta\nde ay lifetime of the neutron. The storage is based on the re\u001de tion of the UCN\nby sele ted materials under any angle of in iden e. The re\u001de tion is aused by\nthe oherent strong intera tion of the neutron with the atomi nu lei. Quantum\nme hani ally, this an be des ribed by an e\u001be tive potential whi h is ommonly\nreferred to as Fermi pseudo potential or the material opti al potential, Uf .\nThe storage of neutrons with very low energies was predi ted by Zeldovi h [1\u2104\nin 1959 and experimentally realized simultaneously by groups in Dubna [2\u2104 and in\nMuni h [3\u2104 in 1968. Sin e then, UCN have be ome a unique tool for fundamental\nneutron physi s, e.g., experiments looking for a permanent ele tri dipole moment of\nthe neutron (nEDM) [4\u2104 or measuring the neutron lifetime [5,6\u2104. UCN have velo ities\ntypi ally below 7 m/s, orresponding to energies below 250 neV.\nThe material opti al potential Uf an be expressed as Uf = V \u2212 \u0131W [7\u2104, where\nthe wall-potential V des ribes the re\u001de ting and W the absorbing behaviour of the\nmaterial and is given by\n\n2 \u03c0 h\u03042 X\nNi bi ,\n*\nV =\nm\ni\n\nW =\n\nh\u0304 X\nNi \u03c3i vth .\n*\n2 i\n\n(1)\n\nHere, m is the neutron mass, N is the s attering enter density, b is the bound\noherent s attering length, \u03c3 is the sum of the absorption, \u03c3a , and the inelasti s attering ross se tion, \u03c3ins , at thermal neutron velo ities, vth . The sum over i in ludes\nall spe i\u001c nu lei of the hemi al omposition. Neutrons with a normal velo ity\nomponent below a riti al value vc = (2 V /m)1/2 are totally re\u001de ted from the surfa e. The loss probability per re\u001de tion is expressed by the energy-independent loss\noe\u001e ient \u03b7 = W/V .\nThe v 2 dependen e of the UCN velo ity spe trum leads to a storable UCN density\nwhi h s ales with V 3/2 . Therefore, V has to be as high as possible to in rease\nstatisti s in UCN experiments. At the same time, the \u03b7 value has to be low enough\nto redu e absorption and ups attering losses. Besides this, spe i\u001c experiments\nlike the nEDM require additional properties of the materials, e.g., high ele tri al\n3\n\n\fresistivity (also against surfa e urrents), non-magneti properties, and high va uum\nompatiblility.\nThe material with the so far highest known wall-potential ommonly used in\nUCN experiments, is\n\n58\n\nNi with V = 346 neV orresponding to a riti al velo ity of\n\nvc = 8.1 m/s. Ni kel, however, is magneti and ondu tive. So far, only beryllium\noxide (BeO, V = 261 neV, \u03b7 < 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) satis\u001ces all riteria mentioned above. But\nits toxi ity may be prohibitive.\nLooking for other non-toxi , non-magneti materials with high wall potentials\nand high ele tri al resistivity, we got interested in ubi boron nitride ( BN). Due\nto its hardness and high wear resistan e, BN is under development as a super-hard\noating (mi ro-hardness > 50 GPa, [8\u2104) for utting tools in the metal ma hining\nindustry.\nNatural boron onsists of two isotopes of abundan e ratio:\n\n10\n\nB/11 B = 0.248. The\n\nal ulation of the pseudo-potential of this hemi al omposite using Eq. (1) and the\ngiven material parameters, \u03c1 \u2248 3.5 g/cm3 [9, 10\u2104, N \u2248 8.5\u00d71022 cm\u22123 , b(10 B) =\n\n\u22120.1 fm, b(11 B) = 6.65 fm, b(N)=9.36 fm, yields V = 324 neV and \u03b7 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nThe value for \u03b7 re\u001de ts the enormously high absorption ross se tion of\n\n10\n\nB, \u03c3a =\n\n3840 barn [11\u2104.\nThis drawba k an, in prin iple, be over ome by using isotopi ally enri hed\n\n11\n\nB\n\nin the omposite (\u03c3a = 0.0055 barn), whi h results in an even higher wall-potential\nof V = 351 neV. The value of \u03b7 \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 in this ase is mainly dominated by the\nabsorption of\n\n14\n\nN (\u03c3a = 1.9 barn) for an\n\n11\n\nB enri hment of > 99.95 %. As a \u001crst\n\nstep, we started with the investigations of natural BN.\n\n2. Experiments\n\nWe arried out two experiments to measure the riti al velo ity of UCN re\u001de ted\nfrom natural BN using (i) a time-of-\u001dight (TOF) measurement in order to determine the transmission of ultra old and very old neutrons (VCN) through a sili on\nwafer (380 \u03bcm) oated with natural BN of thi kness 300 nm and (ii) old neutron\n\n4\n\n\fre\u001de tometry with the same sample. For omparison, a natural ni kel oated sample\nwith a layer thi kness of 500 nm was investigated using the TOF method.\nThe BN \u001clms were prepared in a rea tive r.f. diode sputtering system using\nan ele tri ally ondu ting boron arbide (B4 C) target. In order to rea h good adhering BN layers, a spe ial pro ess was used starting with an interlayer of boron\narbide and ontinuing with graded BCN interlayers, where the arbon is repla ed\nby nitrogen by means of an in remental hange from argon to nitrogen as sputter\ngas. Further information on the pro ess and the sputtering fa ility an be found\nin Refs. [8, 12, 13\u2104. With this method, BN layers of up to 2 \u03bcm thi kness and a\nubi phase ontent of approximately 90 % (measured by IR spe tros opy [8,12,13\u2104),\norresponding to a density of 3.3 g/ m3, are produ ed.\nThe Ni kel oating was produ ed at Hahn-Meitner-Institut (HMI) by onventional\nDC magnetron sputtering. With this te hnique it is possible to rea h oating densities lose to 100% of bulk material.\n\n2.1 The time-of-\u001dight experiment\nIn the time-of-\u001dight (TOF) experiment, we determined the neutron opti al potential\nvia the riti al neutron velo ity from the transmission of slow neutrons through the\nsample. The experiment was performed at the solid deuterium UCN sour e at\nbeamport C [14\u2104 of the resear h rea tor TRIGA Mainz [15, 16\u2104. This rea tor an\nbe operated at a steady-state power of 100 kW or in pulsed mode with a maximum\npower of 250 MW and an energy release of 10 MWs [17\u2104.\nIn prin iple, a TOF measurement an be performed both in the pulsed or in\nsteady state mode of the rea tor. In the pulsed mode, the minimal overall length\nof the \u001dight path is from the layout of the rea tor (biologi al shield, ryostat, et .,\nf. [14\u2104) more than 6 m. In su h a long UCN guide, part of the neutrons are\nrepeatedly di\u001busely s attered ba k and forth and the neutron guide a ts also as\na neutron storage hamber. This leads to a delay of these s attered neutrons in\nrea hing the dete tor apparently at a lower velo ity whi h in\u001duen es the results.\n\n5\n\n\fIn the steady state mode using a hopper for the TOF information, the TOF path\nlength an be hosen to be mu h shorter and the delay e\u001be t is negligible.\nTherefore in this experiment, the rea tor was operated in the steady-state mode\nof 100 kW thermal power. In all measurements, the same amount of solid deuterium\n(4 mol) in the UCN sour e was used. Outside the biologi al shield of the rea tor ore,\nat a distan e of \u223c4 m from the solid 2 H2 onverter, the in-pile part of the neutron\nguide is terminated by an aluminium window at room temperature. We used a\ntime-of-\u001dight spe trometer with a hopper [18\u2104 similar to that used in Refs. [19\u0015\n21\u2104. The neutrons were guided via ele tro-polished stainless steel tubes with inner\ndiameter 66 mm from the UCN sour e to the TOF spe trometer. The arrangement\nis s hemati ally sket hed in Fig. 1. Neutrons enter from the left and pass the TOF\nspe trometer towards a Cas ade-U dete tor [22\u2104 at the end of the \u001dight path. The\n\u001dight path between hopper and dete tor was (1006 \u00b1 3)mm. The Al entran e\nwindow of the dete tor was 0.1 mm thi k with an energy barrier of 54 neV from the\nmaterial opti al potential of aluminium and aused some redu tion of the dete tor\ne\u001e ien y. With this setup, the (averaged) velo ity omponent along the forward\ndire tion an be measured.\nThe oated sili on wafers (diameter 76 mm) were inserted in a foil holder pla ed\nin front of the hopper operating at a duty y le of 4.0 % and at a frequen y of 1.0\nHz. For the orre t determination of a velo ity distribution with the TOF method,\nwe assume a high guide transmission for UCN,\n\ni.e.\n\na high per entage of spe ular\n\nre\u001de tions in the UCN guide system, whi h is experimentally supported by Ref. [23\u2104.\nWithout sample, the ount rate in our TOF spe trometer was about 45 s\u22121 .\nAs DAQ system, we used a standard TOF ard from the FAST ompany. The\nTOF spe trum was started with the pulse from the hopper indi ating the hopper\nstatus 'open'. Neutrons were registered with a dwell time of 1.5 ms a ording to\ntheir arrival time in the dete tor. Figure 2 shows the time-of-\u001dight spe tra without\nand with samples,\n\n, the ni kel and ubi natural-boron nitride sample.\n\ni.e.\n\n6\n\n\f2.1.1 Ba kground subtra tion\n\nThe data in Fig. 2 show ba kgrounds originating mainly from three e\u001be ts: (i)\na onstant ba kground whi h originates from thermal neutrons whi h are present\ninside the experimental area during rea tor operation and annot be suppressed\nompletely; (ii) an almost onstant ba kground from neutrons whi h were di\u001busely\ns attered,\n\n, the neutron guide a ts also as a UCN storage hamber whi h is\n\ni.e.\n\nrepeatedly \u001clled by the hopper y les and emptied through the opening to the dete tor; (iii) the periodi humps in the spe tra stem from very old neutrons whi h\nould penetrate thinner parts of the rotating hopper plates. These were to ompensate for the openings in the plates in order to avoid unbalan es (they are now\npainted with the high absorption material Gd2 O3 ).\nWe divided the time s ale of the three spe tra into 10 regions and \u001ctted the ba kground to onstant values in seven regions left and right of the TOF peaks. The\nba kground underneath the peaks was subtra ted by interpolation. The redu ed \u03c72\nof the \u001cts ranged from 1.04 to 3.1 with one as high as 5.7. The \u03c72 values, partly\nsigni\u001c antly larger than 1, originate mainly from sparks in the dete tor during the\n\u001crst days of operation. These sparks were produ ed by short high voltage break\nthroughs from the gas ele tron multiplier (GEM) to the read-out stru ture of the\ndete tor and led to an in reased number of events in several hannels, see, e.g., at\nt = 0.12 s in the BN data in Fig. 2. Surfa e ontaminations (dust parti les) on\nthe GEM foil lead to a lo ally in reased ele tri \u001celd and sparks whi h also lean\nthe surfa e. Consequently, these ontaminations were redu ed and the dete tor was\nmore stable after several days. In order to take these non-statisti al un ertainties\ninto a ount, we \u001crstly repla ed the very few data whi h di\u001bered by more than 5\nstandard deviations from their neighbours by the average of the neighbouring data.\nSe ondly, we in reased the un ertainties of the respe tive data points by a fa tor\n\u221a 2\n\u03c7 , as re ommended, e.g., by Refs. [24,25\u2104. The data after ba kground subtra tion\nused for the further analysis are shown in Fig. 3.\n\n7\n\n\f2.1.2 Time\n\nalibration\n\nTime alibration of the system, see Ref. [19\u2104, was obtained by omparing (i) at one\ndistan e the spe tra taken at two di\u001berent hopper frequen ies; (ii) at one hopper\nfrequen y the TOF spe tra taken at the two distan es. We obtained eight partially\ndependent alibration measurements by omparing the TOF spe tra at di\u001berent\nhopper frequen ies, three pairs at ea h distan e: (a)1.00 Hz, 0.75 Hz, (b)1.00 Hz,\n0.50 Hz, and ( ) 0.75 Hz, 0.50 Hz, and additional three alibration measurements\n(one per frequen y) by omparing the TOF spe tra at the two distan es.\nSin e the ele troni signal from the hopper is produ ed by a photoele tri barrier triggered by an interrupter on one of the rotating hopper dis s, we obtain a\ntime di\u001beren e, \u03b4t, between the ele troni trigger signal from the hopper and its\nreal opening time. The value of \u03b4t depends on the hopper frequen y. Averaging\nall available and independent information we \u001cnd \u03b4t(1Hz) = (0.191 \u00b1 0.003) s. Reently, the alibration measurements were repeated at ILL with frequen ies 0.5 Hz,\n1 Hz, and 1.25 Hz on\u001crming the earlier result [19\u2104.\n\n2.2 Analysis of the time-of-\u001dight experiment\nIn order to extra t the values of the opti al potential from the layers of interest,\nwe developed an analysis pro edure following three steps. In the \u001crst step, we\napproximated the measured data with no sample and after ba kground subtra tion\nwith a ubi spline fu tion based on nine data points in order to obtain an analyti\nexpression for the data. The \u03c72 per degree-of-freedom was 2.8 whi h on the one\nhand originates from sparks in the dete tor and on the other hand re\u001de ts the\nrather simpli\u001ced parameterization of the spe trum by the spline whi h, however,\nis su\u001e ient for our purposes. In order to take this non-statisti al un ertainty into\n\u221a\na ount, we in reased the un ertainties of the data points by a fa tor \u03c72 , see above.\nIn a se ond step, we al ulate the transmission of the UCNs through layers.\nFor given values of the Fermi potential of ea h layer, we developed pro edures to\nperform a one-dimensional numeri al solution of the S hr\u00f6dinger equation. Hereby,\n\n8\n\n\fwe in lude surfa e roughness via smearing of the potential step at the border of\nadja ent layers. Mat hing the numeri al solution of the S hr\u00f6dinger equation outside\nthe layers with the well known analyti al solution for plane wave propagation allows\nus to al ulate the value for the transmission.\nIn the third step, we ompare our model with the measured data. For this\npurpose, we onvolute the produ t of the transmission fun tion (step 2) and the\ninitial spe trum (step 1) with the opening fun tion of the hopper, see Fig. 4. The\nfree parameters of the \u001ct were the mean free paths in the oated layers ( BN, Ni), the\nloss parameter \u03b7 and the roughness of the sample. The values of these parameters\nwere obtained by omparison of our model with the data and minimisation using\nstandard least square \u001ctting te hniques. The experimental data with the \u001cnal \u001ct\nare shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, the urves for the velo ity dependent transmission\nfor the di\u001berent measured samples as derived from the analysis are shown.\nDue to its ferromagneti properties, the neutron transmission through the Ni\nsample results in the sum of the transmission for the di\u001berent neutron spin states\n(with their di\u001berent opti al potential values). From the measured data, we extra t\nthe value of the opti al potential for spin down of (207 \u00b1 2) neV and for spin up\n(284 \u00b1 2) neV (here \u00b1 2 neV in ludes un ertainty of \u001ct only). The redu ed \u03c72 of\nthe \u001ct is 4.5, see above. This results orrespond to a Ni bulk density of 98 % of the\nni kel density.\nFor our BN sample, we obtain a value for the opti al potential of (305 \u00b1 2)\nneV. From this, we al ulate a value of 90 % for the bulk density. The redu ed \u03c72\nof the \u001ct was 1.7.\nIn order to take these \u03c72 values as non-statisti al un ertainties into a ount, we\n\u221a\nin rease the un ertainties (\u00b1 2 neV) by the fa tors \u03c72 . The main ontributions\nto the total un ertainty arise, however, from the time alibration of the TOF spe trometer, \u03b4V = 15 neV; the un ertainty originating from the \u001dight path un ertainty\nis 2 neV. Thus, the total un etainties of our values for the opti al potentials are\n\n\u2206V \u2248 15 neV. The \u001cnal results of our analysis are summarized in Table I. While\n9\n\n\fthe opti al potential of BN has never been measured before, the values for Ni are\nin ex ellent agreement with literature values [20\u2104.\n\n2.3 The neutron re\u001de tometry experiment\nThe se ond experiment using neutron re\u001de tometry was performed at the neutron\nre\u001de tometer V14 at the old beam at the HMI. This method measures the riti al\nangle for total re\u001de tion of old neutrons at grazing in iden e, where the velo ity\nomponent normal to the surfa e is omparable to the velo ity of UCN. Unlike UCN,\nold neutrons do not su\u001ber from small angle s attering inside the sample. Due to\nthis fa t, old neutron re\u001de tometry an be seen as ross- heque to the transmission\nmeasurements.\nThe neutron riti al angle of total re\u001de tion, \u03b8c , is dire tly onne ted with the\ns attering length density,\n\n, the term N * b in equation (1), via the formula\n\ni.e.\n\nsin \u03b8c\n=\n\u03bb\n\ns\n\nN *b\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the neutron wavelength (4.9 \u00c5 at V14). By measuring \u03b8c for the samples\nunder investigation, V an be determined using Eq.1:\n\n2\u03c0 2h\u03042 sin2 \u03b8c\nV =\nm * \u03bb2\n\n(3)\n\nThe re\u001de tivity fun tion for the analysis of the data was derived with the same\nquantum me hani al al ulation as mentioned above. However, be ause of the divergent beam pro\u001cle, the obtained re\u001de tivity fun tion has to be onvoluted with\nthe known neutron beam pro\u001cle.\nIn the \u001ct, the free parameters were (i) the s attering length density N * b, f.\nEq. 2, and (ii) the roughness and omposition of the surfa es (substrate and oating). The model of the BN sample is represented by three layers, air, BN, and\nsili on. The s attering lengths, b, for air, boron, nitrogen, and sili on were taken\nfrom the literature [28\u2104. The redu ed \u03c72 of the \u001ct to the re\u001de tivity data is 3.0.\nThe un ertainties of old neutron re\u001de tometry depend strongly on the \u001datness of\nthe samples under investigation. Sili on wafers usually have very smooth surfa es\nbut not ne essarily a high \u001datness over the whole oated sample. This in reases the\n10\n\n\fun ertainty of the result. In order to take su h an (unknown) apparative un ertainty\ninto a ount, the experimental un ertainties were s aled [24, 25\u2104 to obtain a \u03c72 of\none. Figure 7 shows the experimental data and the \u001ct. The extra ted value of V\nfor the re\u001de tometer data is shown in Table 1.\n\n3. Con lusions and outlook\n\nThe opti al potential value V of natural ubi boron nitride was determined experimentally for the \u001crst time via the energy dependent transmission of very slow\nneutrons through a BN layer, Vtrans = (305 \u00b1 15) neV and by old neutron re\u001de trometry, Vrefl = (300 \u00b1 30) neV. Both values agree with ea h other and are in\nex ellent agreement with theoreti al expe tations, V = 308 neV, obtained from Eq.\n1 and for the fra tion of the ubi phase, whi h was determined independently by\ninfrared spe tros opy to be about 90 % [8\u001510\u2104. Using isotopi ally enri hed\nsamples with a fra tion of\n\n11\n\n11\n\nBN\n\nB > 99.95 %, we expe t a 10 % in rease of V and a\n\nsigni\u001c antly redu ed loss value \u03b7 , as shown in Fig. 6. This will be demonstrated in\nthe near future.\nIn addition to the experimental determinations of the opti al potential, the insulator properties of the BN samples were investigated using a high resistan e meter\n4339 A in ombination with the resistivity ell 16008B (Hewlett Pa kard). We found\nvalues for the spe i\u001c resistivity R > 3.4*1016 ohm* m. This is omparable to other\nhigh resistivity values,\n\ne.g.\n\nof natural diamond or quartz.\n\nIn on lusion, ubi boron nitride is a very promising material for oatings with\nhigh opti al potential and high resistivity.\nFurthermore, it is ertainly worth while to investigate ubi\nC3 N4 , and isotopi ally pure\n\n11\n\narbon nitride,\n\nB4 C as further oating materials for the physi s\n\nwith ultra- old neutrons. From ref. [27\u2104 we expe t, that one an obtain an opti al\npotential value of C3 N4 as high as V \u2248 391 neV (b(C) = 6.646 fm, \u03c1( C3 N4 \u2248 4\ng/ m3 [28\u2104) with \u03b7 being similar to the isotopi ally pure ubi boron nitride. For\na oating with boron arbide,\n\n11\n\nB4 C, an very low loss parameter \u03b7 is expe ted,\n\n11\n\n\f\u03b7 \u2248 10\u22127 (\u03c3a = 0.0035 barn) with the opti al potential V \u2248 235 neV (\u03c1 = 2.52\ng/ m3 ).\n\nA knowledgements\nWe thank the rew of the rea tor TRIGA Mainz, J.
