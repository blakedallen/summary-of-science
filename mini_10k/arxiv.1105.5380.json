Then the von Neumann\nentropy of x is\nH(x) := \u2212 Tr[xx\u2217 ln xx\u2217 ],\nand the minimum entropy output of the subspace K is\nH(K) :=\n\nmin\n\nx\u2208K,Tr[xx\u2217 ]=1\n\nH(xx\u2217 ).\n\nRecently, Hastings [1] disproved the famous additivity\nconjecture, which posited that\nH(K1 \u2297 K2 ) = H(K1 ) + H(K2 ).\n\n(1)\n\nThis conjecture was considered one of the most significant\nopen problems in quantum information theory, spawning\na large literature [2]. Its importance was motivated in\npart by the problem of finding the classical capacity of a\nquantum channel, and in part by a result of Peter Shor [3]\nthat showed that a number of apparently distinct additivity conjectures, including the additivity of the minimum\nentropy output of a quantum channel, the additivity of\nthe entanglement of formation, and the additivity of the\nHolevo capacity, were all equivalent.\nHastings' counterexample showed that the von Neumann entropy function is not globally additive on subspaces: in other words, if x1 is a global minimum in K1\nand x2 is a global minimum in K2 , then x1 \u2297 x2 is not\nnecessarily a global minimum in K1 \u2297 K2 . On the other\nhand, in this paper we show that under certain conditions the von Neumann entropy is locally additive. More\nprecisely, we show that if Ki is a subspace with a local minimum xi , and xi x\u2217i commutes with xi yi\u2217 for every\nyi \u2208 Ki , then x1 \u2297 x2 is a local minimum of K1 \u2297 K2 ;\nwe call this condition the local commutativity condition.\nMore generally, we study the behaviour of entropy functions of the eigenvalues of xx\u2217 , and we consider when\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: friedlan@uic.edu\naddress: gour@ucalgary.ca\n\u2021 Electronic address: aproy@uwaterloo.ca\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nthe tensor product of two local minima is again a local\nminimum.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section I we analyze the local commutativity condition. In Section II,\nwe consider the first derivative of the entropy function\nand note that critical points of the von Neumann and\nRenyi entropies are closed under tensor products. These\nresults are due to a group participating in the American\nInstitute for Mathematics workshop on \"Geometry and\nrepresentation theory\"[4]. In Section III, we consider the\nsecond derivative of the von Neumann entropy function,\nand show that local minima of von Neumann entropy are\nclosed under tensor products, given the previously mentioned commutativity assumption. Finally, in Section IV,\nwe consider the second derivative of the 2-norm entropy\nfunction. We show that local minima of the 2-norm are\nclosed under tensor products if one of the subspaces has\ndimension 2. In the Appendix A we analyze the affine\nparametrization and use it to derive a necessary condition for local minima. In Appendix B we show that there\nis a simple counter example for the additivity conjecture\nover the real numbers.\n\nI.\n\nTHE LOCAL COMMUTATIVITY\nCONDITION\n\nFor a P\ngiven function f : [0, \u221e) \u2192 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) we define\nm\nf (x) = i=1 f (\u03bbi (xx\u2217 )) for x \u2208 Cm\u00d7n , and \u03bbi are the\neigenvalues of xx\u2217 . We assume that either f is smooth\non [0, \u221e), i.e. has two continuous derivatives at every\nt \u2265 0, or f (t) = H(t) \u2261 \u2212t log t. Let Dy f (x), Dy2 f (y)\ndenote the first and the second derivative of f in the y\ndirection:\nDy f (x) =\n\nd\nf (x + \u01eby)\nd\u01eb\n\n\u01eb=0\n\n,\n\nDy2 f (x) =\n\nd2\nf (x + \u01eby)\nd2 \u01eb\n\n\u01eb=0\n\nThen x is a critical point if and only if Dy f (x) = 0 for\neach y \u2208 K (in the next section we will discuss in more\ndetails this condition).\nHere we focus on the function f (t) = H(t) \u2261 \u2212t log t.\nIn this case we need to be very careful when dealing with\nxx\u2217 which have zero eigenvalues. We will see that for any\n\n\f2\nx, y \u2208 Cm\u00d7n , Dy f (x) \u2208 R. However it is possible that\nDy2 f = \u221e, and below we give the exact conditions on y\nwhen this happens. Hence if x is a critical point of the\nvon Neumann entropy, H(x), and Dy2 H(x) = \u221e then\nH(x + \u01eby) > H(x) for small enough \u01eb. Thus when we\nstudy in the next sections the local minimum of H(K1 \u2297\nK2 ) at the critical point x1 \u2297 x2 we need only to consider\nyi such that Dy2i f < \u221e for i = 1, 2. This will also give a\npartial explanation of the local commutativity condition\ndiscussed in the introduction.\nLemma 1. Let x, y \u2208 Cm\u00d7n , Tr xx\u2217 > 0 and H(t) =\n\u2212t log t. Then Dy H(x) \u2208 R. Change standard orthonormal bases in Cm , Cn to new orthonormal bases such that\nx, y have the forms\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nx11\n0r,n\u2212r\ny11 y12\nx=\nand y =\n, (2)\n0m\u2212r,r 0m\u2212r,n\u2212r\ny21 y22\nwith 0i,j \u2208 Ci\u00d7j and x11 , y11 \u2208 Cr\u00d7r . Then Dy2 f (x) = \u221e\nif and only if y22 6= 0.\nProof. By considering U KV , where U, V unitary we may\nassume that x, y in the form (2). Furthermore x11 = D \u2261\ndiag(d1 , . . . , dr ), where d1 \u2265 d2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 dr > 0 and r is\nthe rank of x. So di is the i-th singular value, \u03c3i (x11 ) for\ni = 1, . . . , r. Observe next that\nTr((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ) =\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03bbi ((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ). (3)\n\ni=1\n\nWe assume here that the eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix are arranged in a nonincreasing order. Note that\n(x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 = xx\u2217 + \u01eb(xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 ) + \u01eb2 (yy \u2217 )\nHence\n\u03bbi ((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ) = \u03bbi (xx\u2217 + \u01eb(xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 )) + O(\u01eb2 ).\nObserve next that\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nxx + \u01eb(xy + yx ) =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nD + \u01eb(Dy11\n+ y11 D) \u01ebDy21\n\u01eby21 D\n0\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\nFor small \u01eb, the first variation formula (see [5]) yields\n\u03bbi ((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ) = di + d\u2032i \u01eb + O(\u01eb2 ) for i = 1, . . . , r,\n\u03bbi ((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ) = O(\u01eb2 ) for i > r.\nHence \u03bbi ((x+ \u01eby)(x+ \u01eby)\u2217 ) = d\u2032\u2032i \u01eb2 + O(\u01eb3 ) for i > r, with\nd\u2032\u2032r+1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 d\u2032\u2032m \u2265 0. These calculations show that\nH(x + \u01eby) = H(D + \u01eby11 ) \u2212\n\nm\nX\n\nd\u2032\u2032i \u01eb2\n\nlog(d\u2032\u2032i \u01eb2 ) + O(\u01eb2 ).\n\nn\nr+1\n\n\u0001\n\nmatrix whose entries are (r + 1) \u00d7 (r + 1) minors of\nx + \u01eby.) Note that \u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby) is a polynomial matrix in\n\u01eb. Since x has rank r it follows that \u2227r+1 (x) = 0. Hence\n\u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby) = \u01ebz1 + \u01eb2 z2 (\u01eb), where z1 is a constant\nmatrix and z2 (\u01eb) is a polynomial matrix in \u01eb. We claim\nthat z1 = 0 if and only if y22 = 0. Indeed since D is\ndiagonal then a minor of order r + 1 that can have a\nnonzero derivative at \u01eb = 0 is the minor based on the\nrows \u03b1 = {1, . . . , r, p} and columns \u03b2 = {1, . . . , r, q}.\nDenote this minor by det(x + \u01eby)[\u03b1, \u03b2]. Clearly det(x +\n\u01eby)[\u03b1, \u03b2] = \u01eb(d1 . . . dr yp,q ) + O(\u01eb2 ), where yp,q is the p, q\nentry of y. So if y22 = 0 we obtain that z1 = 0. Hence\nk \u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby)k2 = \u03c31 (\u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby)) \u2264 \u01eb2 a for some\npositive a. Recall that\n(\u03c31 (\u2227r+1 (\u03be + \u01eby)))2 =\n\nr+1\nY\n\n\u03bbi ((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ).\n\ni=1\n\nAs (\u03c31 (\u2227r+1 (\u03be + \u01eby)))2 \u2264 a2 \u01eb4 , we deduce that d\u2032\u2032r+1 = 0.\nIt is left to show that if yp,q 6= 0 for some p, q > r, then\nd\u2032\u2032r+1 > 0. Clearly,\nk \u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby)k2 \u2265 | det(x + \u01eby)[\u03b1, \u03b2]| \u2265 d1 . . . dr |yp,q |\n\n|\u01eb|\n2\n\nfor some small value of \u01eb. (The first inequality follows\nfrom the fact the l2 norm of a matrix is not less than\nthe absolute value of any of its entries.) This shows that\nd\u2032\u2032r+1 > 0.\nThe lemma above implies that for the purpose of calculating local minima, without loss of generality, we can\nalways take the directional derivatives in a direction with\ny22 = 0. In the lemma above, however, we did not impose the normalization condition Tr(xx\u2217 ) = 1. As we\nshow in the next lemma, it does not affect the result that\nDy2 H = \u221e if and only if y22 = 0.\nLemma 2. Let x, y \u2208 Cm\u00d7n , with Tr(xx\u2217 ) = 1 and\ny 6= 0. Consider the matrix\n1\nx(y, \u01eb) := p\n(x + \u01eby) ,\nTr((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 )\n\nwhich is always defined for small |\u01eb|.\nThen\nd2\nd\nd\u01eb H(x(y, \u01eb))|\u01eb=0 \u2208 R, and d\u01eb2 H(x(y, \u01eb))|\u01eb=0 = \u221e if and\nonly if Dy2 (f ) = \u221e.\nProof. The functions h1 (\u01eb) := (Tr((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ))\u22121\nand h2 (\u01eb) := log Tr((x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ) are analytic in the\nneighborhood of \u01eb = 0, and clearly\nH(x(y, \u01eb)) = h1 (\u01eb)f (\u01eb) + h2 (\u01eb).\n\n(4)\n\nAs h1 (0) = 1 we obtain\n\ni=r+1\n\nHence Dy H(x) \u2208 R and Dy2 H(x) = \u221e if and only if\nd\u2032\u2032r+1 > 0. It is left to show that d\u2032\u2032r+1 > 0 if and only\nif y22 6= 0. Consider \u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby). the r + 1 compound\n\u0001\nm\nmatrix of x + \u01eby. (Recall that \u2227r+1 (x + \u01eby) is the r+1\n\u00d7\n\nd\nH(x(y, \u01eb))|\u01eb=0 = Dy (f ) + h\u20321 (0)H(x) + h\u20322 (0) \u2208 R,\nd\u01eb\n2\n\nd\n2\nwhile d\u01eb\n2 H(x(y, \u01eb))|\u01eb=0 consists of Dy (f ) plus finite\nterms. The lemma follows.\n\n\f3\nThe two lemmas above imply the following characterization of the local commutative condition discussed in\nthe introduction.\nLemma 3. Let the assumptions of Lemma 1 hold. Assume that x, y are in the form (2). Then xx\u2217 commutes\nwith xy \u2217 if and only if y21 = 0 and x11 x\u221711 commutes with\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nx11 y11\n(which is equivalent to x\u221711 x11 y11\n= y11\nx11 x\u221711 .)\nProof. Write x and y as in (2). The assumption that\nx11 is invertible, and xx\u2217 commutes with xy \u2217 is equiv\u2217\nalent to y21 = 0 and x11 x\u221711 commutes with x11 y11\n. So\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nx11 x11 x11 y11 = x11 y11 x11 x11 . Divide both sides of this\nequalities by x11 to obtain the lemma.\nIn particular, the above lemma together with the theorem in Section III imply that local additivity holds for\nsubspaces consisting of matrices y as in Eq. (2), with y11\ndiagonal, y21 = 0, and y12 arbitrary.\nII. FIRST DERIVATIVE OF ENTROPY\nFUNCTIONS UNDER TENSOR PRODUCTS\n\nAll of the results in this section are due to the \"Quantum Information Group\" participating in the workshop \"Geometry and representation theory\", held at the\nAmerican Institute for Mathematics [4]; we record the\nresults here for completeness.\nFor a given function f (t) as defined above, let Dy f (x)\ndenote the derivative of f in the y direction:\nDy f (x) =\n\nd\nf (x + \u01eby)\nd\u01eb\n\n\u01eb=0\n\n.\n\nThen x is a critical point if and only if Dy f (x) = 0 for\nevery y. Since we are interested in local minima in K\nsubject to Tr[xx\u2217 ] = 1, we restrict y to the tangent space\n{y \u2208 K : Dy Tr[xx\u2217 ] = 0} = {y \u2208 K : Tr[xy \u2217 +yx\u2217 ] = 0}.\nAlso, we restrict our attention to functions f (x) which\ndepend only on xx\u2217 . Since xx\u2217 is invariant under x 7\u2192 ix,\nwe may ignore y = ix. That is, x \u2208 K is critical if and\nonly if Dy f (x) = 0 for every y in the orthogonal subspace\nx\u22a5 := {y \u2208 K : Tr[xy \u2217 ] = 0}.\nUnder tensor products, the orthogonal subspace has\nthe following decomposition:\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n(x1 \u2297 x2 )\u22a5 = hx1 i \u2297 x\u22a5\n\u2295 x\u22a5\n2\n1 \u2297 hx2 i \u2295 x1 \u2297 x2 .\n\nFor a function f (x) depending only on xx\u2217 , a point\nx \u2208 K is critical in K if and only if Dy f (x) = 0 for\nevery y \u2208 x\u22a5 . In general, given a univariate differentiable\nfunction F , a Taylor series expansion of F shows that the\nmatrix function a 7\u2192 Tr[F (a)] has directional derivative\nd\nTr[F (a + \u01ebb)]\nd\u01eb\n\n\u01eb=0\n\n= Tr[F \u2032 (a)b].\n\nWe are interested in the case a = xx\u2217 and b = xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 :\nif f (x) = Tr[F (xx\u2217 )], then\nDy f (x) = Tr[F \u2032 (xx\u2217 )(xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 )].\n\nThis derivative is zero for all y \u2208 x\u22a5 if and only if\nTr[F \u2032 (xx\u2217 )xy \u2217 ] = 0 for all y \u2208 x\u22a5 .\nTheorem 1. Let F be a differentiable univariate function such that F \u2032 (a1 \u2297 a2 ) is in the span of\n{F \u2032 (a1 ) \u2297 F \u2032 (a2 ), F \u2032 (a1 ) \u2297 I, I \u2297 F \u2032 (a2 ), I \u2297 I}.\nIf x1 and x2 are critical points of f (x) = Tr[F (xx\u2217 )]\nsubject to Tr[xx\u2217 ] = 1, then so is x1 \u2297 x2 .\nProof. Let x = x1 \u2297 x2 . It suffices to show that if\nDyi f (xi ) = 0 for all yi \u2208 x\u22a5\ni , then Dy f (x) = 0 for\nall y \u2208 x\u22a5 . That is, if Tr[F \u2032 (xi x\u2217i )xi yi\u2217 ] = 0, then\nTr[F \u2032 (xx\u2217 )xy \u2217 ] = 0.\nFirst, suppose y = y1 \u2297 y2 , for some arbitrary y1\nand y2 , and consider the term in F (xx\u2217 ) proportional\nto F \u2032 (x1 x\u22171 ) \u2297 F \u2032 (x2 x\u22172 ): we have\nTr[(F \u2032 (x1 x\u22171 ) \u2297 F \u2032 (x2 x\u22172 )) (xy \u2217 )]\n= Tr[F \u2032 (x1 x\u22171 )x1 y1\u2217 ] Tr[F \u2032 (x2 x\u22172 )x2 y2\u2217 ],\n\u22a5\nwhich is 0 provided that either y1 \u2208 x\u22a5\n1 or y2 \u2208 x2 (or\nboth). Likewise, for the term proportional to F \u2032 (x1 x\u22171 ) \u2297\nI,\n\nTr[(F \u2032 (x1 x\u22171 ) \u2297 I) (xy \u2217 )] = Tr[F \u2032 (x1 x\u22171 )x1 y1\u2217 ] Tr[x2 y2\u2217 ],\n\u22a5\nwhich again is 0 if either y1 \u2208 x\u22a5\n1 or y2 \u2208 x2 . Similarly,\nTr[(I \u2297 F \u2032 (x2 x\u22172 )) (xy \u2217 )] = 0 and Tr[(I \u2297 I) (xy \u2217 )] = 0.\nCombining the terms which make up F \u2032 (xx\u2217 ), we see\nthat Tr[F \u2032 (xx\u2217 )(xy \u2217 )] = 0 whenever y = y1 \u2297 y2 satisfies\n\u22a5\ny1 \u2208 x\u22a5\n1 or y2 \u2208 x2 .\nNow an arbitrary element y \u2208 x\u22a5 can be written as a\nlinear combination of terms of the form x1 \u2297 y2 , y1 \u2297 x2 ,\nand y1 \u2297 y2 , with yi \u2208 x\u22a5\ni . For each of these terms either\nthe first or second component of the tensor product is in\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u22a5\nx\u22a5\ni . Therefore Tr[F (xx )xy ] = 0 for all y \u2208 x .\n\nOur main interest is in the function x 7\u2192\n\u2212 Tr[xx\u2217 ln xx\u2217 ], which is proportional to the usual von\nNeumann entropy of the matrix xx\u2217 . Letting F (t) =\n\u2212t ln t, so that F \u2032 (t) = \u2212(1 + ln t), we have\nF \u2032 (a1 \u2297 a2 ) = \u2212I \u2212 ln(a1 \u2297 a2 )\n= \u2212I \u2297 I \u2212 ln(a1 ) \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297 ln(a2 )\n\u2208 span {I \u2297 I, F \u2032 (a1 ) \u2297 I, I \u2297 F \u2032 (a2 )} .\n(Here we used the fact that ln(a1 \u2297 a2 ) = ln(a1 ) \u2297 I + I \u2297\nln(a2 ).) Thus the hypotheses of Theorem 1 are satisfied,\nand so critical points of x 7\u2192 \u2212 Tr[xx\u2217 ln xx\u2217 ] are closed\nunder tensor products.\nAnother important class of entropy functions are the\np-norms:\np\n\nx 7\u2192 ||xx\u2217 ||p = Tr[(xx\u2217 )p ].\nLetting F (t) = tp , so F \u2032 (t) = ptp\u22121 , we have\nF \u2032 (a1 \u2297 a2 ) = p(a1 \u2297 a2 )p\u22121 =\n\n1 \u2032\nF (a1 ) \u2297 F \u2032 (a2 ).\np\n\n\f4\nAgain F (t) is in the form of Theorem 1. Thus for both\nthe von Neumann entropy and the p-norms, the tensor\nproduct of critical points (subject to Tr[xx\u2217 ] = 1) are\nagain critical points.\nIII.\n\nSECOND DERIVATIVE OF THE\nVON-NEUMANN ENTROPY\n\nIn this section we show that under the local commutativity condition, if x1 \u2208 K1 and x2 \u2208 K2 are nonsingular\nstrong local minima of\nx 7\u2192 \u2212 Tr[xx\u2217 log xx\u2217 ]\nsubject to Tr[xx\u2217 ] = 1, then x1 \u2297 x2 is also a strong local\nminimum in K1 \u2297 K2 . More precisely, we assume that if\nyi \u2208 Ki is orthogonal to xi , then xi x\u2217i and xi yi\u2217 commute.\nThroughout this section we will also assume without loss\nof generality that Tr[yy \u2217 ] = 1.\nIn this section we work with the normalized entropy\nfunction\n\u0014 \u2217\n\u0015\nxx\nxx\u2217\nH(x) := \u2212 Tr\n.\nlog\n||x||2\n||x||2\nA point x is a strong local minimum of H on {x :\nTr[xx\u2217 ] = 1} if and only if for every y orthogonal to\nx, the second directional derivative Dy2 H(x) is positive.\nLemma 4. Assume xx\u2217 and xy \u2217 commute. Then\n\u2212Tr[(xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 )2 (xx\u2217 )\u22121 ] ,\n\u2217\n\nwhere the last trace is taken over the support of xx .\nProof. For convenience define a = xx\u2217 , b = xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 ,\nand c = yy \u2217 , so that\n2\n\n(x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby) = a + \u01ebb + \u01eb c.\nNote that Tr[a] = Tr[c] = 1 and Tr[b] = 0, so Tr[(x +\n\u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 ] = 1 + \u01eb2 . Then\n\u0014\n\u0015\na + \u01ebb + \u01eb2 c\na + \u01ebb + \u01eb2 c\nH(x + \u01eby) = \u2212 Tr\nlog\n1 + \u01eb2\n1 + \u01eb2\n2\n2\nTr[(a + \u01ebb + \u01eb c) log(a + \u01ebb + \u01eb c)]\n=\u2212\n+ log(1 + \u01eb2 ).\n1 + \u01eb2\nUp to a second order in \u03b5 this expression becomes\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nH(x + \u01eby) = \u2212Tr a log a + \u03b5b + \u03b52 c\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u03b5Tr [b log (a + \u03b5b)] + \u03b52 1 + Tr [a log a] \u2212 Tr [c log a] .\n\nTherefore, the second order directional derivative can be\nexpressed in the following way:\nDy2 H(x) = \u2212\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nd\nTr a log a + \u03b5b + \u03b52 c\n2\nd\u03b5\n\nd\nTr [b log (a + \u03b5b)]\nd\u03b5\n\n\u03b5=0\n\n\u03b5=0\n\nlog(a + \u03b5b) = log[I \u2212 (I \u2212 a \u2212 \u03b5b)] = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n(I \u2212 a \u2212 \u03b5b)n\n.\nn\nn=1\n\nWithout loss of generality (see Lemma 1), in the last\nequality we assumed that a is invertible, so that for\nsufficiently small \u03b5 also a + \u03b5b is invertible and therefore I \u2212 a \u2212 \u03b5b < I. To calculate the derivative of\nTr [b log (a + \u03b5b)] at \u03b5 = 0, we only need to take terms\nproportional to \u03b5 in the expansion of the logarithm. Assuming a and b commute,\nd\nTr [b log (a + \u03b5b)]\nd\u03b5\n\n\u03b5=0\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nTr b2 (I \u2212 a)n\u22121\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= Tr b2 a\u22121 .\n\nTo calculate the second derivative of Tr[a log(a+\u03b5b+\u03b52 c)]\nwe need only take the terms proportional to \u03b52 . Again\nassuming a and b commute and a is invertible,\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nd2\nTr a log a + \u03b5b + \u03b52 c\nd\u03b52\n\u03b5=0\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n2 n\nn\u22122 2\nTr a(I \u2212 a)n\u22121 c\nTr a(I \u2212 a)\nb +2\n=\u2212\nn\n2\nn=1\nn=2\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n= \u2212Tr a\u22121 b2 + 2 Tr[c] = \u2212Tr a\u22121 b2 + 2.\n\nTherefore Dy2 H(x) = 2Tr [a log a] \u2212 2Tr [c log a] \u2212\nTr[b2 a\u22121 ].\n\nDy2 H(x) = 2Tr [xx\u2217 log xx\u2217 ] \u2212 2Tr [yy \u2217 log xx\u2217 ]\n\n\u2217\n\nTo calculate the derivative expressions above, we will express the log function by its Taylor series:\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n+2 1 + Tr [a log a] \u2212 Tr [c log a] .\n\nCorollary 1. Assume xx\u2217 and xy \u2217 commute. Then\nDy2 H(x) > 0 if and only if\nTr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 (xy \u2217 )2 ] + Tr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 xy \u2217 yx\u2217 ]\n< Tr[xx\u2217 log xx\u2217 ] \u2212 Tr[yy \u2217 log xx\u2217 ] ,\nwhere (xx\u2217 )\u22121 is the inverse over the support of xx\u2217 .\nProof. Expand (xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 )2 into four terms, noting that\nxy \u2217 and yx\u2217 commute with (xx\u2217 )\u22121 . Then Dy H(x) > 0\nif and only if\nTr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 (xy \u2217 )2 ] + Tr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 + (yx\u2217 )2 ] + 2 Tr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 xy \u2217 yx\u2217 ]\n< \u22122 Tr[yy \u2217 log xx\u2217 ] + 2 Tr[xx\u2217 log xx\u2217 ].\nThe first two terms on the LHS are twice the real part of\nTr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 (xy \u2217 )2 ]; the largest value of these two terms\nover all phases of y is 2 Tr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 (xy \u2217 )2 ] .\nFor convenience, denote the terms in Corollary 1 as\nfollows:\na(x, y) := Tr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 (xy \u2217 )2 ] ,\nb(x, y) := Tr[(xx\u2217 )\u22121 xy \u2217 yx\u2217 ],\nc(x) := Tr[xx\u2217 log xx\u2217 ],\nd(x, y) := Tr[yy \u2217 log xx\u2217 ],\n\n(5)\n\n\f5\nso Dy2 H(x) > 0 if and only if a + b < c \u2212 d. Each of these\nterms behaves nicely under tensor products:\na(x1 \u2297 x2 , y1 \u2297 y2 ) = a(x1 , y1 )a(x2 , y2 ),\nb(x1 \u2297 x2 , y1 \u2297 y2 ) = b(x1 , y1 )b(x2 , y2 ),\nc(x1 \u2297 x2 ) = c(x1 ) + c(x2 ),\nd(x1 \u2297 x2 , y1 \u2297 y2 ) = d(x1 , y1 ) + d(x2 , y2 ).\n\n(6)\n\nWe can also bound the size of some of these terms for any\nx and y such that Tr[xy \u2217 ] = 0 and Tr[xx\u2217 ] = Tr[yy \u2217 ] =\n1. First, we claim b \u2208 [0, 1]. To see this, note that\nP = x\u2217 (xx\u2217 )\u22121 x is a projection matrix, so\nb = Tr[y \u2217 yx\u2217 (xx\u2217 )\u22121 x] = ||P y \u2217 ||2 ,\nand 0 \u2264 ||P y \u2217 ||2 \u2264 ||y \u2217 || = 1. Second, we claim a \u2208 [0, b].\nTo see this, note that without loss of generality (see\nLemma 1) we can assume that xx\u2217 is invertible and therefore positive definite, so (xx\u2217 )\u22121/2 exists and commutes\nwith xy \u2217 , and so (xx\u2217 )\u22121 (xy \u2217 )2 = ((xx\u2217 )\u22121/2 xy \u2217 )2 . By\nCauchy-Schwartz,\na = Tr[((xx\u2217 )\u22121/2 xy \u2217 )2 ]\n\u2217 \u22121/2\n\n\u2264 Tr[((xx )\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217 \u22121/2\n\nxy )((xx )\n\n\u2217 \u2217\n\nxy ) ] = b.\n\nThirdly, we claim that c \u2264 0, since it is the negative of\nthe entropy function. We are now ready to prove the\nmain result of this paper.\nTheorem 2. Suppose x1 and x2 are strong local minima of x 7\u2192 \u2212 Tr[xx\u2217 log xx\u2217 ] subject to Tr[xx\u2217 ] = 1 and\nxi \u2208 Ki , where Ki is a subspace. Further assume that\nfor every yi \u2208 Ki , the matrices xi x\u2217i and xi yi\u2217 commute.\nThen x := x1 \u2297 x2 is a strong local minimum in K1 \u2297 K2 .\nProof. We show that under the hypotheses of the theorem, if Dy2i H(xi ) is positive for every yi \u2208 x\u22a5\ni , then\n2\n\u22a5\nDy H(x) is positive for every y \u2208 x . We break the proof\ninto several cases depending on y.\nFirst, suppose y is a tensor product.\n\u22a5\nCase y = x1 \u2297 y2 , y2 \u2208 x\u22a5\n2 : Since y2 \u2208 x2 and x2 is a\nstrong local minimum, we know that\na(x2 , y2 ) + b(x2 , y2 ) < c(x2 ) \u2212 d(x2 , y2 ).\nIt is also easy to see from the expressions (5) that\na(x1 , x1 ) = b(x1 , x1 ) = 1,\n\nc(x1 ) = d(x1 , x1 ).\n\nSo, using the expressions for tensors in (6), we have\na(x, y) + b(x, y) = a(x2 , y2 ) + b(x2 , y2 )\n\u2264 c(x2 ) \u2212 d(x2 , y2 )\n= c(x) \u2212 d(x, y).\nThus the second directional derivative is positive for this\nchoice of y.\nCase y = y1 \u2297 x2 , y1 \u2208 x\u22a5\n1 : This case is similar to y =\nx1 \u2297 y2 .\n\nCase y = y1 \u2297 y2 , yi \u2208 x\u22a5\nHere we require the\ni :\narithmetic-geometric mean inequality. For two terms\na1 , a2 \u2264 1,\na1 a2 \u2264\n\n\u0010 a + a \u00112\n1\n1\n2\n\u2264 (a1 + a2 ).\n2\n2\n\nIn particular, a(x1 , x1 )a(x2 , y2 ) \u2264 a(x1 , y1 ) + a(x2 , y2 )\nand similarly for b. Now, since yi \u2208 x\u22a5\ni , we have\na(xi , yi ) + b(xi , yi ) < c(xi ) \u2212 d(xi , yi ). Combining these\ninequalities we get a(x, y) + b(x, y) \u2264 c(x) \u2212 d(x, y).\nNext, we consider cases where y is a linear combination\nof terms.\n\u22a5\nSuppose y is in x\u22a5\n1 \u2297 x2 . In this case, we break y into\ntwo orthogonal pieces according to the projection matrix\nP = x\u2217 (xx\u2217 )\u22121 x. Let Pi = x\u2217i (xi x\u2217i )\u22121 xi : this is the\nprojection matrix onto the range of x\u2217i , which we denote\nR(x\u2217i ). Then P = P1 \u2297 P2 is the projection matrix onto\nthe range R(x\u2217 ) = R(x\u22171 ) \u2297 R(x\u22172 ). Write y as a direct\nsum:\ny = \u03b1u + \u03b2v,\nwhere u\u2217 \u2208 R(x\u2217 ) (so P u\u2217 = u\u2217 ), and P v \u2217 = 0.\nnormalizations are chosen so that \u03b1 \u2208 R and \u03b2\n2\n2\nsatisfy \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 = 1, and ||u|| = ||v|| = 1. We deal\nthe u and v components separately.\n\u22a5\n\u2217\nCase y = u \u2208 (x\u22a5\nHere we\n1 \u2297 x2 ) \u2229 R(x ):\n\u2217 2\n\nThe\n\u2208 R\nwith\nhave\n\n\u2217 2\n\nb(x, u) = ||P u || = ||u || = 1. Note that if yi is in x\u22a5\ni ,\nthen\nTr[xi Pi yi\u2217 ] = Tr[xi x\u2217i (xi x\u2217i )\u22121 xi yi\u2217 ] = Tr[xi yi\u2217 ] = 0,\nP\nso Pi yi\u2217 is also in x\u22a5\ni .

Expanding out terms of yy \u2217\nand simplifying, we find that most terms disappear under\n\nIn this section we focus on the 2-norm since its second\ndirectional derivative has an elegant analytical form.

Since it is known that the 2-norm\nis not globally additive, this result sheds some light on\nthe possibility that there exist functions that are locally\nadditive while they are not globally additive.\nWe will work with the normalized function\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 #\nxx\u2217\nTr[(xx\u2217 )2 ]\n.\nH2 (x) := Tr\n=\n2\n[Tr(xx\u2217 )]2\n||x||\nAs before, we consider (x + \u01eby)(x + \u01eby)\u2217 = xx\u2217 + \u01eb(xy \u2217 +\nyx\u2217 )+\u01eb2 (yy \u2217 ), where Tr[xx\u2217 ] = Tr[yy \u2217 ] = 1 and Tr[xy \u2217 +\nyx\u2217 ] = 0.

The second derivative is\n\nSince a(xi )\n>\nb(xi , yi ) + c(xi , yi ) + d(xi , yi )\nand each term is nonnegative, it follows that\na(x1 )a(x2 ) > b(x1 , y1 )b(x2 , y21 ) + c(x1 , y1 )c(x2 , y21 ) +\nd(x1 , y1 )d(x2 , y21 ), and so F (x, y) is negative.\nCase y = x1 \u2297 y22 : Here\nF (x, y) = \u2212a(x1 )a(x2 ) + a(x1 )b(x2 , y22 )\n+a(x1 )c(x2 , y22 ) + a(x1 )d(x2 , y22 ).\n\nDy2 H2 (x) = 2 Tr[(xy \u2217 +yx\u2217 )2 ]+4 Tr[xx\u2217 yy \u2217 ]\u22124 Tr[(xx\u2217 )2 ].\nFor strong local maxima we expect Dy2 H2 (x) to be negative. Expand (xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 )2 into four terms: then\nTr[(xy \u2217 + yx\u2217 )2 ] = 2 Re Tr[(xy \u2217 )2 ] + Tr[x\u2217 xy \u2217 y],\nwhere Re(z) denotes the real part of z. The largest value\nof Re Tr[(xy \u2217 )2 ] over all choices of unit multiples of y is\nTr[(xy \u2217 )2 ] . In summary:\n\nBut \u2212a(x2 ) + b(x2 , y22 ) + c(x2 , y22 ) + d(x2 , y22 ) < 0 and\na(x1 ) > 0, so F (x, y) is negative.\nCase y = y1 \u2297 x2 : Similar to y = x1 \u2297 y22 .\nNow consider a linear combination of the three elements of x\u22a5 , say\ny = \u03b1(y1 \u2297 y21 ) + \u03b2(x1 \u2297 y22 ) + \u03b3(y1 \u2297 x2 ).\n\nLemma 5.

Let K \u2286 Rm\u00d7m be an orthogonal subspace. Then k := dim K \u2264 \u03c1(m), and this inequality\nis sharp for any m \u2208 N. More precisely, assume that\nIm \u2208 K and k \u2265 2. Then K has a basis Im , Q1 , . . . , Qk\u22121\nwhere Q1 , . . . , Qk\u22121 is a set of skew symmetric orthogonal anticommuting matrices, i.e. Qi Qj = \u2212Qj Qi for any\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 k \u2212 1.\n\n\f9\nConversely, if Q1 , . . . , Qk\u22121 \u2208 Rm\u00d7m are k \u2212 1\nskew symmetric orthogonal anticommuting matrices then\nspan(Im , Q1 , . . . , Qk\u22121 ) is an k-dimensional orthogonal\nsubspace.\n\nIn particular, the additivity conjecture does not hold for\nreal subspaces of matrices.\n\nIf Q \u2208 Rm\u00d7m is an orthogonal matrix, then all m singular values of Q are equal to 1. Let Qi \u2208 Rmi \u00d7mi be an\northogonal matrix for i = 1, 2. Then for any real a1 , a2 ,\nthe singular values of ai Qi are |ai |, and the singular values of (a1 Q1 ) \u2297 (a2 Q2 ) are all |a1 a2 |.\nSuppose furthermore that m1 , m2 are even and Q1 , Q2\nare skew symmetric orthogonal\nmatrices.\u221aThen ai Qi has\n\u221a\nmi\neigenvalues\nequal\nto\na\n\u22121\nand \u2212ai \u22121 for i = 1, 2\ni\n2\nrepectively. Furthermore, (a1 Q) \u2297 (a2 Q) is a real symmetric matrix with m12m2 eigenvalues equal to a1 a2 and\nm1 m2\neigenvalues equal to \u2212a1 a2 .\n2\n\nProof. Since any matrix x \u2208 K is of the form aQ for\nsome orthogonal Q it follows that if Tr(xx\u22a4 ) = 1 then\n1\n. Hence H(x) =\nthe singular values of x are all equal to m\nlog m and H(K) = log m.\nAssume now that K1 , K2 are orthogonal spaces of dimension two at least. Without loss of generality we may\nassume that Im1 , Q1 \u2208 Rm1 \u00d7m1 and Im2 , Q2 \u2208 Rm2 \u00d7m2 ,\nwhere Q1 , Q2 are orthogonal. Hence Im1 m2 = Im1 \u2297 Im2\nand Q1 \u2297 Q2 are both in K1 \u2297 K2 . Recall that Q1 \u2297 Q2\nis a symmetric matrix which has m12m2 eigenvalues equal\nto 1 and \u22121 respectively. Hence Q1 \u2297 Q2 + Im1 m2 is\na nonnegative definite real symmetric matrices which\nhas m12m2 eigenvalues equal to 2 and 0 respectively. Let\n1\nx = ( m12m2 ) 2 (Q1 \u2297 Q2 + Im1 m2 ). Then Tr(xx\u22a4 ) = 1\nand x has m12m2 nonzero singular values all equal to\n1\n( m12m2 ) 2 . Hence H(K1 \u2297 K2 ) \u2264 H(x) = log( m12m2 ).\n\nTheorem 4.
