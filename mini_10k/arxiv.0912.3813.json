With the unprecedented angular resolution,\neffective area, field of view, and timing resolution, in the GeV band, of the Large\nArea Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the light curve\nof the Vela pulsar can be studied in greater detail than ever before. Using a\ntiming solution derived solely from the LAT data, phase aligned with the radio\nemission, the spectrum of the Vela pulsar has been fit in intervals as small as\n0.0016 in phase. Significant variation is seen in the cutoff energy and photon index\nacross the light curve, strongly supporting curvature radiation as the source of\nthe high-energy \u03b3-rays from the Vela pulsar.\n1.

Large variations of \u03c1c with phase\nare also expected in these models and mapping the minimum \u03c1c , using basic geometric models, can produce trends similar to\nwhat is seen in Figure 4, but full radiation models will be needed to match all of\nthe features.
