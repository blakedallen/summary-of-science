Introduction\nThe observed spectra of Galactic cosmic rays\n(CRs) are shaped by two basic processes the acceleration in the sources and the subsequent propagation in cosmic magnetic fields\nand radiation fields. A transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays is expected\nto occur somewhere between 1017 eV and\n1019 eV (e.g. Hillas, 2005; Aharonian et al.,\n2011). A preponderance of evidence suggests\nthat the particle acceleration mechanism most\nlikely responsible is diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) (e.g., Blandford & Eichler, 1987;\nJones & Ellison, 1991; Malkov & Drury,\n2001).\nAn important question for DSA and CR\norigin has always centered around the maximum particle energy a given shock can produce. For a shock of a given size, age, and\nmagnetic field geometry, the maximum CR\nSend offprint requests to: A.M. Bykov\n\nenergy depends mainly on the power in the\nlongest wavelength turbulence. The weakly\nanisotropic distribution of accelerated particles, i.e., CRs is considered in \u00a7 2 as an agent\nproducing this turbulence in a symbiotic relationship where the magnetic turbulence required to accelerate the CRs is created by the\naccelerated CRs themselves.\nOther important issue of the high energy\nCR acceleration models is the environment\nwhere the supernova exploded. Some models\nof CRs acceleration by SNRs in active star\nforming regions are briefly discussed in \u00a7 3.\nOB-associations and young globular clusters\nare observed both in the Milky Way and LMC.\nThe study of the stellar content of the galactic object Cygnus OB2 by Kn\u00f6dlseder (2000)\nhave revealed that the number of OB member stars can be estimated as large as 2600 \u00b1\n400, while the number of O stars amounts to\n120 \u00b1 20. The high number of stellar X-ray\nsources detected with Chandra by Wright &\n\n\f2\n\nA.M.Bykov et al: The sources of galactic cosmic rays\n\nDrake (2009) confirmed the status of Cygnus\nOB2 as one of the most massive SFRs in the\nMilky Way. Given the apparently compact size\nof Cygnus OB2 one may expect a number of\nmassive stars with strong winds to be in a close\nproximity with less than 10 pc separation in\naddition to the well known colliding-wind binaries that are expected to be particle accelerators (e.g. Eichler & Usov, 1993). Another\nvery compact young stellar cluster Westerlund\n2 containing more than dozen O stars was\nfound in the Carina region with estimated age\nto be younger than 4 Myrs, so the most massive stars are expected to explode there within\nthe next few Myrs. OB associations with supernova explosions are creating superbubbles\n(SBs). Bamba et al. (2004) discovered both\nthermal and nonthermal X-rays from the shells\nof the SB 30 Dor C in the LMC. The X-ray\nmorphology was reported as a nearly circular\nshell with a radius of 40 pc, which is bright\non the northern and western sides. Maddox\net al. (2009) analyzed Suzaku observations of\nthe SB around the OB association LH9 in\nthe HII complex N11 in the Large Magellanic\nCloud. Their X-ray spectral analysis revealed\nthat the hard X-ray emission (> 2 keV) requires a hard nonthermal power-law component. The energy budget analysis for N11 using the known stellar content of LH9 indicated\nthat the observed thermal and kinetic energy\nin the SB is only half of the expected mechanical energy injected by stars, consistent with the\nexpectation of SB models with efficient CR acceleration (e.g. Bykov, 2001; Butt & Bykov,\n2008). Diffuse X-ray emission was detected\nfrom many sites of massive star formation: the\nCarina Nebula, M17, 30 Doradus, NGC 3576,\nNGC 3603, and others (e.g. Townsley et al.,\n2011). The H.E.S.S. telescope detected highenergy gamma rays from starburst galaxy NGC\n253 supporting the ideas of efficient CR acceleration in active starforming regions (Acero,\n2009).\n\n2. Magnetic field amplification in CR\nacceleration sources\nFast and efficient CR acceleration by Fermi\nmechanism requires that particles are multi-\n\nply scattered by magnetic fluctuations in the\nacceleration source (e.g. shock). The magnitude of the required magnetic fluctuations is\nsubstantially higher than the ambient magnetic\nturbulence forcing a bootstrap scenario where\nthe accelerated particles amplify the turbulence required for their acceleration. The study\nof turbulence generation associated with CRs\nand DSA has a long history. Magnetic field\namplification due to the resonant cosmic-ray\nstreaming instability was studied in the context of galactic cosmic-ray origin and propagation since the 1960s (see e.g. Kulsrud &\nCesarsky, 1971; Wentzel, 1974; Achterberg,\n1981; Berezinskii et al., 1990; Zweibel, 2003).\nIt was proposed by Bell (1978) as a source of\nmagnetic turbulence in the test particle DSA\nscenario, and nonlinear models of DSA including CR-driven instabilities and magnetic\nfield amplification were investigated by Bell\n(2004); Amato & Blasi (2006); Zirakashvili &\nPtuskin (2008),Vladimirov et al. (2008, 2009)\nand Reville et al. (2009).\nIt is instructive to summarize the growth\nrates for magnetic instabilities that the quasilinear theory predicts for weakly anisotropic\nCR distributions of the form\n\u0011\u0015\n\u03b4\u0010\nN \u0014\n1 + 3\u03b2s \u03bc + 3\u03bc2 \u2212 1 ,\n(1)\nf (p) =\n4\u03c0\n2\nwhere \u03b8 - particle pitch-angle, \u03bc = cos \u03b8 ,\n\u03b2 s = u s /c, with the flow (shock) velocity u s ,\n\u03b4(p) - is the magnitude of the second harmonic anisotropy. We included here the second harmonic anisotropy to illustrate the effect\nof the CR-firehose instability on the magnetic\nfield amplification. The substantial anisotropy\nof the second harmonics can be expected in\nmore complex plasma flows than just an isolated shock.

At longer wavelengths however the second term in the square\nbrackets in Eq. (7) dominate and the CRfirehose type instability appear at xm << 1. The\nCR-firehose instability rate is indicated by the\ndashed line at the left panel in Figure 1. The\nCR-firehose instability may even dominate the\nregime Im(\u03c9) \u221d k3/2 in the case of the second\nharmonic comparable with the first harmonic\n(CR current) of the anisotropy, i.e. \u03b4 \u221d \u03b2 s .\nThe CR-firehose growth rate in that regime is\nshown by the dotted curve in Figure 1. That\nlikely requires a more complicated structure of\nthe magnetic field in the flow. The flow in the\nvicinity of the SNR colliding with a powerful\nstellar wind (see e.g. Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2003)\ndiscussed below as the PeV CR acceleration\nsite may be relevant. To derive the growth rates\nof the modes in the long-wavelength regime\nk\u039b < 1 (i.e. x0 < \u03b7\u22121 ) the collisionless kinetic\nequation approach discussed above is not appropriate. One should average the kinetic equation for the relativistic particles, the equations\nof the bulk plasma motions and the induction\nequation over the ensemble of the short scale\nfluctuations produced by CR instabilities in the\ncollisionless regime e.g. by the fast Bell instability. In the presence of the short-scale fluctuations, the momentum exchange between the\nCRs and the flow in the hydrodynamic regime,\nresults in a ponderomotive force that depends\non the CR current in the mean-field momentum equation of bulk plasma (Bykov et al.,\n2011). As a result, there exist transverse growing modes with wavevectors along the initial\nmagnetic field with growth rates that are proportional to the turbulent coefficients determined by the short scale fluctuations. The magnetic field amplification in that regime only\nweakly depends on the shock velocity [as it follows from Eq. (48) in Bykov et al. (2011)], that\nis important for the evolution of the maximal\nenergy of CRs accelerated by DSA.\n\nF(p) p (arb. normalized)\n\n4\n\nlog(p/p0)\n\nFig. 3.

Moreover, it was recently argued\nby Ptuskin et al. (2010) that the maximum energy of accelerated particles differs strongly for\ndifferent supernova types. The energy may exceed 1017 eV for protons accelerated in an isolated Type IIb SNR. The highest energies CRs\n\n\fA.M.Bykov et al: The sources of galactic cosmic rays\n\nare thought to be accelerated before the Sedov\nstage in isolated SNRs.\nFor supernova exploded in a young stellar\ncluster the presence of a nearby strong stellar\nwind allow to increase the maximum energy\nof accelerated particles comparing to that in an\nisolated SNR. The SNRs can produce the high\nenergy CRs at the Sedov evolution stage.\nThe most massive O stars begin to explode\nas core collapsed supernovae about a few million years after the formation of a young stellar\ncluster. The young stars with masses above \u223c\n16 M\u2299 (of B0 V type and earlier) are thought\nto create hot low-density bubbles and HII regions with radii \u223c 10 pc surrounded by a massive shell of matter swept up from the parent\ncloud by the stellar wind. In this case, a strong\nsupernova shock propagates for a few thousand\nyears in tenuous circumstellar matter with a velocity well above 103 km/s before reaching the\ndense massive shell. The blast wave of the SNR\nis expected to accelerate the wind material producing ultra-relativistic ions and electrons. The\naccelerated particles escape from the SNR forward shock presumably at the highest energy\nregime (e.g. Ptuskin et al., 2010; Gabici, 2011;\nEllison & Bykov, 2011) and can reach the termination shock of the stellar wind of a nearby\nmassive star. We modeled the energetic particle\nacceleration in the region where the expanding\nsupernova shell is approaching a powerful stellar wind of a young massive star as it is illustrated in Figure 2. At the evolution stage where\nthe mean free path of the highest energy CR\nis comparable to the distance between the two\nshocks L the system is characterized by an unusually hard spectral energy distribution illustrated by the solid line in Figure 3. The stage\ncan last more than 1,000 yrs. For comparison\nwe showed with the dotted line the CR spectrum accelerated by an isolated SNR shock of\nthe same age. The case of Bohm diffusion was\nsimulated with D(p) \u221d p.\nA simple analytical kinetic model of particle acceleration by the Fermi mechanism in\nthe converging flows carrying fluctuating magnetic fields amplified by anisotropic CR distributions can be considered. It is a model of high\nenergy CR acceleration by a SNR expanding\nin a compact OB-association. At some expan-\n\n5\n\nsion phase the distance L between the SNR approaching the stellar wind shock is less than the\nmean free path of the highest energy CR particle in the SNR shock precursor. Then CR distribution function around the shocks (i = 1, 2)\ncan be approximated as\n\u0011\n\u0010\nfi (x, p, t) = Ap\u22123 exp \u2212 Duii |x| \u00d7\n(8)\n\u00d7H (p \u2212 p0 ) H (t \u2212 \u03c4a )\nwhere the highest energy CR acceleration time\n!\nZp\nD1 D2 d p\n3\n\u03c4a =\n+\n.\n(9)\n(u1 + u2 ) u1\nu2 p\np0\n\nThe acceleration mechanism can provide\nefficient creation of a nonthermal particle population with a very hard energy spectrum, containing a substantial part of the kinetic energy\nreleased by the supernova. The high energy\nnonthermal emission of the sources is characterized by a very hard spectral energy distribution peaked at the maximal photon energies\nand have the apparent properties of the \"dark\naccelerators\". The TeV source in the vicinity\nof the \u03b3-Cygni SNR can be belong to the class.\nAt the later stage of the young stellar cluster evolution multiple supernova explosions\nwith great energy release in the form of shock\nwaves inside the superbubbles are argued as a\nfavorable site of nonthermal particle acceleration. The collective effect of both stellar winds\nof massive stars and core collapsed supernovae\nas particle acceleration agents were discussed\nby Bykov & Toptygin (2001); Parizot et al.\n(2004); Torres & Domingo-Santamar\u0131\u0301a (2007);\nFerrand & Marcowith (2010).\nAcknowledgements.
