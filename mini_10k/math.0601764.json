The main result is the exhibition\nof explicit examples of U(1)-invariant associative cones in R7 and Cayley 4-folds\nin R8 which are invariant under SU(2). This research is motivated by the work\nof Joyce in [4] on special Lagrangian (SL) m-folds in Cm , and the work of the\nauthor in [6].\nIn Section 2, we describe the calibrations and calibrated submanifolds that\nare the focus of our study. These are called associative 3-folds and coassociative\n4-folds in R7 and Cayley 4-folds in R8 .\nThe method of construction to produce calibrated submanifolds with symmetries is discussed in Section 3. The key result is that we may define examples\nusing a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. This section also\nreviews the relevant material from [6].\nSections 4 and 5 contain the explicit examples. The first gives the system of\ndifferential equations defining U(1)-invariant associative cones. These equations\nare solved in a special case to give a 4-dimensional family of associative cones\nover T 2 . Further, using the material in [6, \u00a76] and these cones, we produce\nexamples of ruled associative 3-folds.\nSection 5 considers Cayley 4-folds invariant under an action of SU(2). The\nfamily of all Cayley 4-folds invariant under this action is described using a real\noctic and three real quartics. Cayley 4-folds invariant under SU(2) are also\nconsidered in [1]; there is some overlap between our example and those given in\nthis reference.\nThe final section gives some further examples of systems of ordinary dif-\n\n1\n\n\fferential equations defining associative, coassociative and Cayley submanifolds,\neach associated with a symmetry group which is described.\nNotes\n(a) Manifolds are assumed to be nonsingular and submanifolds to be immersed\nunless stated otherwise.\n(b) By a cone in Rn we shall mean a dilation-invariant submanifold of Rn\nwhich is nonsingular except possibly at 0.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nCalibrated submanifolds of R7 and R8\nCalibrated geometry\n\nWe define calibrations and calibrated submanifolds following the approach in [2].\nDefinition 2.1 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold. An oriented tangent\nk-plane V on M is an oriented k-dimensional vector subspace V of Tx M , for\nsome x in M . Given an oriented tangent k-plane V on M , g|V is a Euclidean\nmetric on V and hence, using g|V and the orientation on V , there is a natural\nvolume form, volV , which is a k-form on V .\nA closed k-form \u03b7 on M is a calibration on M if \u03b7|V \u2264 volV for all oriented\ntangent k-planes V on M , where \u03b7|V = \u03ba * volV for some \u03ba \u2208 R, so \u03b7|V \u2264\nvolV if \u03ba \u2264 1. An oriented k-dimensional submanifold N of M is a calibrated\nsubmanifold or \u03b7-submanifold if \u03b7|Tx N = volTx N for all x \u2208 N .\nCalibrated submanifolds are minimal submanifolds [2, Theorem II.4.2]. The\nminimality of calibrated submanifolds provides the following property, as discussed in [2].\nTheorem 2.2 A calibrated submanifold is real analytic wherever it is nonsingular.\n\n2.2\n\nAssociative and coassociative submanifolds of R7\n\nThe convention we adopt here for calibrations on R7 agree with [3, Chapter 10].\nDefinition 2.3 Let (x1 , . . . , x7 ) be coordinates on R7 and write dxij...k for the\nform dxi \u2227 dxj \u2227 . . . \u2227 dxk . Define a 3-form \u03c60 by:\n\u03c60 = dx123 + dx145 + dx167 + dx246 \u2212 dx257 \u2212 dx347 \u2212 dx356 .\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fBy [2, Theorem IV.1.4], \u03c60 is a calibration on R7 and submanifolds calibrated\nwith respect to \u03c60 are called associative 3-folds.\nThe 4-form \u2217\u03c60 , where \u03c60 and \u2217\u03c60 are related by the Hodge star, is given\nby:\n\u2217 \u03c60 = dx4567 + dx2367 + dx2345 + dx1357 \u2212 dx1346 \u2212 dx1256 \u2212 dx1247 .\n\n(2)\n\nBy [2, Theorem IV.1.16], \u2217\u03c60 is a calibration on R7 , and \u2217\u03c60 -submanifolds are\ncalled coassociative 4-folds.\nRemark The form \u03c60 is often referred to as the G2 3-form on R7 since the Lie\ngroup G2 may be defined as the stabilizer of \u03c60 in GL(7, R).\nWe have a far more useful description of coassociative 4-folds which follows\nfrom [2, Proposition IV.4.5 & Theorem IV.4.6].\nProposition 2.4 A 4-dimensional submanifold M of R7 , with an appropriate\norientation, is coassociative if and only if \u03c60 |M \u2261 0.\n\n2.3\n\nCayley submanifolds of R8\n\nOur definition of a distinguished 4-form on R8 used to describe Cayley 4-folds\nagrees with the convention in [3, Chapter 10].\nDefinition 2.5 Let (x1 , . . . , x8 ) be coordinates on R8 and write dxij...k for the\nform dxi \u2227 dxj \u2227 . . . \u2227 dxk . Define a 4-form \u03a60 by:\n\u03a60 = dx1234 + dx1256 + dx1278 + dx1357 \u2212 dx1368 \u2212 dx1458 \u2212 dx1467\n+ dx5678 + dx3478 + dx3456 + dx2468 \u2212 dx2457 \u2212 dx2367 \u2212 dx2358 .\n\n(3)\n\nBy [2, Theorem IV.1.24], \u03a60 is a calibration on R8 , and submanifolds calibrated\nwith respect to \u03a60 are called Cayley 4-folds.\nRemark The stabilizer of \u03a60 in GL(8, R) is the Lie group Spin(7). We may\nthus refer to \u03a60 as the Spin(7) 4-form.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nConstructing examples with symmetries\nEvolution equations\n\nIn [6], an evolution equation for associative 3-folds in R7 was derived as a generalisation of the work of Joyce [4] on special Lagrangian m-folds in Cm . The\n3\n\n\fproof relies on Theorem 2.2 and the following result from Harvey and Lawson\n[2, Theorem IV.4.1].\nTheorem 3.1 Let P be a 2-dimensional real analytic submanifold of R7 . There\nlocally exists a real analytic associative 3-fold N in R7 which contains P . Moreover, N is locally unique.\nWe now present the theorem [6, Theorem 4.3].\nTheorem 3.2 Let P be a compact, orientable, 2-dimensional, real analytic\nmanifold, \u03c7 a real analytic nowhere vanishing section of \u039b2 T P and \u03c8 : P \u2192 R7\na real analytic embedding (immersion). There exist \u01eb > 0 and a unique family\n{\u03c8t : t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb)} of real analytic maps \u03c8t : P \u2192 R7 with \u03c80 = \u03c8 satisfying\n\u0012\n\u0013d\nd\u03c8t\n= (\u03c8t )\u2217 (\u03c7)ab (\u03c60 )abc (g0 )cd ,\n(4)\ndt\nwhere (g0 )cd is the inverse of the Euclidean metric on R7 , using index notation\nfor tensors on R7 . Define \u03a8 : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 P \u2192 R7 by \u03a8(t, p) = \u03c8t (p). Then\nM = Image \u03a8 is a nonsingular embedded (immersed) associative 3-fold in R7 .\nWe sketch the key ideas in the proof. Since P is compact and P , \u03c7, \u03c8\nare real analytic, the Cauchy\u2013Kowalevsky Theorem [7, Theorem B.1] from the\ntheory of partial differential equations gives a family of maps \u03c8t as stated. We\nmay therefore define \u03a8 and M as in the statement of the theorem. Theorem\n3.1 implies there locally exists a locally unique associative 3-fold N containing\n\u03c8(P ). Showing that N and M agree near \u03c8(P ), using the fact that \u03c60 is a\ncalibration, allows us to deduce that M is associative.\nUsing the associative case as a model we can quickly derive analogous evolution equations for coassociative and Cayley 4-folds.\nWe first require two results, [2, Theorem IV.4.3] and [2, Theorem IV.4.6],\nwhich are both similar to Theorem 3.1.\nTheorem 3.3 Suppose P is a 3-dimensional real analytic submanifold of R7\nsuch that \u03c60 |P \u2261 0. There locally exists a real analytic coassociative 4-fold N\nin R7 which contains P . Moreover, N is locally unique.\nRemark Unlike Theorem 3.1, we have to impose an extra condition on the\nboundary submanifold P in order to extend it to a coassociative 4-fold in R7 .\nTheorem 3.4 Suppose P is a 3-dimensional real analytic submanifold of R8 .\nThere locally exists a real analytic Cayley 4-fold N in R8 which contains P .\nMoreover, N is locally unique.\n4\n\n\fWith these results at our disposal, it is clear that we may prove results like\nTheorem 3.2 for coassociative and Cayley 4-folds in exactly the same manner,\nso we omit the proofs.\nTheorem 3.5 Let P be a compact, orientable, 3-dimensional, real analytic\nmanifold, \u03c7 a real analytic nowhere vanishing section of \u039b3 T P and \u03c8 : P \u2192 R7\na real analytic embedding (immersion) such that \u03c8 \u2217 (\u03c60 ) \u2261 0 on P . There exist\n\u01eb > 0 and a unique family {\u03c8t : t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb)} of real analytic maps \u03c8t : P \u2192 R7\nwith \u03c80 = \u03c8 satisfying\n\u0012\n\u0013e\nd\u03c8t\n= (\u03c8t )\u2217 (\u03c7)abc (\u2217\u03c60 )abcd (g0 )de\n(5)\ndt\nusing index notation for tensors on R7 , where (g0 )de is the inverse of the Euclidean metric on R7 . Define \u03a8 : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 P \u2192 R7 by \u03a8(t, p) = \u03c8t (p). Then\nM = Image \u03a8 is a nonsingular embedded (immersed) coassociative 4-fold in R7 .\nNote The condition \u03c8 \u2217 (\u03c60 )|P \u2261 0 implies that \u03c60 vanishes on the real analytic\n3-fold \u03c8(P ) in R7 and allows us to apply Theorem 3.3 as required.\nTheorem 3.6 Let P be a compact, orientable, 3-dimensional, real analytic\nmanifold, \u03c7 a real analytic nowhere vanishing section of \u039b3 T P and \u03c8 : P \u2192 R8\na real analytic embedding (immersion). There exist \u01eb > 0 and a unique family\n{\u03c8t : t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb)} of real analytic maps \u03c8t : P \u2192 R8 with \u03c80 = \u03c8 satisfying\n\u0013e\n\u0012\nd\u03c8t\n= (\u03c8t )\u2217 (\u03c7)abc (\u03a60 )abcd (g0 )de\n(6)\ndt\nusing index notation for tensors on R8 , where (g0 )de is the inverse of the Euclidean metric on R8 . Define \u03a8 : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 P \u2192 R8 by \u03a8(t, p) = \u03c8t (p). Then\nM = Image \u03a8 is a nonsingular embedded (immersed) Cayley 4-fold in R8 .\n\n3.2\n\nThe symmetries method\n\nNow that we have a means of constructing calibrated submanifolds of R7 and\nR8 , we shall consider the situation where the submanifold has a large symmetry\ngroup. The imposition of symmetry on the system reduces its complexity. This\nobservation motivates our method of construction, which is a generalisation of\nthe work of Joyce in [4].\nWe know from the remarks after Definitions 2.3 and 2.5 that it is natural\nto consider subgroups of G2 \u22c9R7 or Spin(7) \u22c9 R8 as symmetry groups for our\ncalibrated submanifolds.\n5\n\n\fLet us consider, for example, the associative case. Suppose that G is a Lie\nsubgroup of G2 \u22c9R7 which has a two-dimensional orbit O \u2286 R7 . Theorem 3.2\nallows us to evolve each point in O transversely to the action of G and hence,\nhopefully, construct an associative 3-fold with symmetry group G.\nFormally, take \u03c7 to be a nowhere vanishing section of \u039b2 T G, which can\neasily be determined by finding a basis for the Lie algebra of G. Define \u03c8 : G \u2192\nO \u2286 R7 to be an embedding given by\n\u03c8(\u03b3) = \u03b3 * (x1 , . . . , x7 )\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 G, where (x1 , . . . , x7 ) is a point in O and \u03b3 * (x1 , . . . , x7 ) denotes the\naction of G on R7 .

However, we also need to choose O so that\n\u03c60 |O = 0; i.e. we need \u03c8 : G \u2192 O to be an embedding such that \u03c8 \u2217 (\u03c60 ) \u2261 0 on\nG.\nTo construct Cayley examples with symmetries, we need to focus on Lie\nsubgroups of Spin(7) \u22c9 R8 that have 3-dimensional orbits.\nRemark If we write the system of differential equations defining coassociative\nor Cayley 4-folds with symmetries in the form\ndx\n= y(x),\ndt\nthe components of y will be cubic functions of the variables in x.\n6\n\n\fThe author has looked at a variety of different subgroups and has derived\nsystems of differential equations defining associative, coassociative and Cayley\nsubmanifolds. However, in the majority of situations the author has been unsuccessful in solving the system. In Sections 4 and 5 we present two important\ncases which we have been able to solve.

Moreover, (8)-(11) imply that x21 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 +\n|z3 |2 can be chosen to be 1 and that Re(z1 z2 z3 ) = A, where A is a real constant.\nProof: Noting that \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 = 0, we immediately see that x21 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 +\n|z3 |3 is a constant which we can take to be one. This is hardly surprising since\n8\n\n\fthe associative 3-fold was constructed so as to be a cone. We also see from\n(9)-(11) that\nd\n(z1 z2 z3 ) = i(\u03b21 |z2 |2 |z3 |2 + \u03b22 |z3 |2 |z1 |2 + \u03b23 |z1 |2 |z2 |2 ),\ndt\nwhich is purely imaginary, and therefore Re(z1 z2 z3 ) = A is a constant.\nNotice that the functions x1 , z1 , z2 and z3 are bounded, hence their first\nderivatives are bounded by (8)-(11). Thus, all of the functions which determine\nthe behaviour of the solutions to (8)-(11) are bounded, from which it follows\nthat they have solutions for all t \u2208 R.\n\u0003\nWriting zj (t) = rj (t)ei\u03b8j (t) for j = 1, 2, 3 and \u03b8 = \u03b81 + \u03b82 + \u03b83 , (8)-(11)\nbecome\ndx1\n= \u03b11 r12 + \u03b12 r22 + \u03b13 r32 ;\ndt\ndr1\n= \u2212\u03b11 x1 r1 + \u03b21 r2 r3 sin \u03b8;\ndt\ndr2\n= \u2212\u03b12 x1 r2 + \u03b22 r3 r1 sin \u03b8;\ndt\ndr3\n= \u2212\u03b13 x1 r3 + \u03b23 r1 r2 sin \u03b8; and\ndt\nd\u03b8j\nrj2\n= \u03b2j A\nfor j = 1, 2, 3,\ndt\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwith the conditions\nx21 + r12 + r22 + r32 = 1 and\nr1 r2 r3 cos \u03b8 = A.\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nWe notice that we are restricted in our choices of the real parameter A. The\nproblem of maximising A2 , by (17) and (18), is equivalent to the problem of\nmaximising r12 r22 r32 subject to r12 + r22 + r32 = 1. By direct calculation the solution\ni\nh\n1\n1\n\u221a\n,\n.

Therefore A \u2208 \u2212 3\u221a\n3 3 3\nsince changing the sign of A corresponds to reversing the sign of cos \u03b8, so the\naddition of \u03c0 to \u03b8.\n1\nis immediately soluble since this forces r1 = r2 =\nThe case where A = 3\u221a\n3\nr3 = \u221a13 , which implies x1 = 0 by (17) and cos \u03b8 = 1 by (18), so we can take\n\u03b8 = 0.

Any associative 3-fold constructed with x1 = 0 will be at least a U(1)invariant special Lagrangian cone and so we shall not consider this situation\nfurther. However, we know that M must be the limiting case of the family of\n1\n.\nassociative 3-folds parameterised by A as it tends to 3\u221a\n3\nWe may also solve the equations in the following special case.\nTheorem 4.3 Use the notation of Theorem 4.2. Suppose that \u03b12 = \u03b13 . Then\nx1 , z1 , z2 and z3 may be chosen to satisfy x21 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 = 1 and\nIm z1 = 0. Moreover, they satisfy:\nRe(z1 z2 z3 ) = A;\nRe(z1 (z22 \u2212 z32 )) = C;\n\n|z1 |(x21 + |z1 |2 \u2212 1) = B;\nand\n\nIm(z1 (z22 + z32 )) = D\n\nfor some real constants A, B, C and D.\nProof: Since \u03b21 = 0, (16) implies that the argument of z1 is constant. Using\nU(1) we can take it to be zero so that z1 is real. Moreover, \u03b21 = 0 and (17)\nimply that x1 and z1 evolve amongst themselves and hence, using (8) and (9),\nwe deduce that the real function f = |z1 |(x21 + |z1 |2 \u2212 1) is constant. Note that\nSU(2) acts on the (z2 , z3 )-plane. We are thus led to calculate\n\u0001\nd\nz1 (az2 + bz3 )(\u2212b\u0304z2 + \u0101z3 )\ndt\n= \u22124i\u03b22 |z1 |2 Re(ab\u0304z2 z3 ) + i\u03b22 |z1 |2 (|a|2 \u2212 |b|2 )(|z3 |2 \u2212 |z2 |2 )\nfor constants a, b \u2208 C, which is purely imaginary. Equating real parts for\n(a, b) = (1, \u22121) and (a, b) = (i, 1) leads to the final two conserved quantities\nin the statement of the theorem.\n\u0003\nIn Theorem 4.3, we have six conditions on seven variables, which thus determine the solution to the system of differential equations (8)-(11) and hence the\n10\n\n\fassociative cone constructed by Theorem 4.2 for \u03b12 = \u03b13 . Moreover, we may\nconstruct a function \u03c0 : R \u2295 C3 \u2192 R6 by mapping (x1 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) to the six real\nconstant functions given in Theorem 4.3, which are defined by the initial values\n\u0001\nx1 (0), z1 (0), z2 (0), z3 (0) .\nSard's Theorem [5, p. 173] states that if f : X \u2192 Y is a smooth map between\nfinite-dimensional manifolds, the set of y \u2208 Y with some x \u2208 f \u22121 (y) such that\ndf |x : Tx X \u2192 Ty Y is not surjective is of measure zero in Y . Therefore, f \u22121 (y) is\na submanifold of X of dimension dim X \u2212 dim Y for almost all y \u2208 Y . Applying\nSard's Theorem, generically the fibres of \u03c0 will be 1-dimensional submanifolds\nof R \u2295 C3 \u223c\n= R7 . Moreover, we know that these fibres are compact by the\nconditions in Theorem 4.3. Hence, the variables form loops in R7 for generic\ninitial values; i.e. the solutions are periodic in t. We deduce the following result.\nTheorem 4.4 Use the notation of Theorem 4.2 and suppose that \u03b12 = \u03b13 . For\ngeneric values of the functions x1 , z1 , z2 and z3 at t = 0, the associative 3-folds\nconstructed by Theorem 4.2 are closed U(1)-invariant cones over T 2 in R7 .\nThis family of cones is determined by four real parameters, whereas the\ncorresponding SL family, as discussed in [4, \u00a77], is parameterised by one rational\nvariable. Therefore, these cones are generically not SL.\nWe may also apply the theory described in [6, \u00a76] to the family of cones\ngiven in Theorem 4.4 to produce examples of ruled associative 3-folds which are\nasymptotically conical. We thus define the terms we require, noting that a cone\nC in R7 is said to be two-sided if C = \u2212C.\nDefinition 4.5 Let M be a 3-dimensional submanifold of R7 . A ruling of\nM is a pair (\u03a3, \u03c0), where \u03a3 is a 2-dimensional manifold and \u03c0 : M \u2192 \u03a3 is a\nsmooth map, such that for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 there exist v\u03c3 \u2208 S 6 , w\u03c3 \u2208 R7 such that\n\u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3) = {rv\u03c3 + w\u03c3 : r \u2208 R}. Then the triple (M, \u03a3, \u03c0) is a ruled submanifold\nof R7 .\nAn r-orientation for a ruling (\u03a3, \u03c0) of M is a choice of orientation for the\naffine straight line \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3) in R7 , for each \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, which varies smoothly with \u03c3.\nA ruled submanifold with an r-orientation for the ruling is called an r-oriented\nruled submanifold.\nLet (M, \u03a3, \u03c0) be an r-oriented ruled submanifold. For each \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, let \u03c6(\u03c3)\nbe the unique unit vector in R7 parallel to \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3) and in the positive direction\nwith respect to the orientation on \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3), given by the r-orientation. Then\n\u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 S 6 is a smooth map. Define \u03c8 : \u03a3 \u2192 R7 such that, for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, \u03c8(\u03c3)\nis the unique vector in \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3) orthogonal to \u03c6(\u03c3). Then \u03c8 is a smooth map\n11\n\n\fand we may write\nM = {r\u03c6(\u03c3) + \u03c8(\u03c3) : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, r \u2208 R}.\n\n(19)\n\nDefine the asymptotic cone M0 of a ruled submanifold M by\nM0 = {v \u2208 R7 : v is parallel to \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3) for some \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3}.\nIf M is also r-oriented, then\nM0 = {r\u03c6(\u03c3) : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, r \u2208 R}\n\n(20)\n\nand is usually a 3-dimensional two-sided cone; that is, whenever \u03c6 is an immersion.\nDefinition 4.6 Let M0 be a closed cone in R7 and let M be a closed nonsingular\nsubmanifold in R7 . We say that M is asymptotically conical to M0 with rate \u03b1,\nfor some \u03b1 < 1, if there exists some constant R > 0, a compact subset K of M\nand a diffeomorphism \u03a8 : M0 \\ B\u0304R \u2192 M \\ K such that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nfor k \u2208 N as r \u2192 \u221e,\n\u2207k \u03a8(x) \u2212 \u03b9(x) = O r\u03b1\u2212k\n\nwhere B\u0304R is the closed ball of radius R in R7 and \u03b9 : M0 \u2192 R7 is the inclusion\nmap.

Since the calculations involved in this method have\nalready been described in detail through the work of the previous two sections,\nwe feel justified in our omission of the relevant calculations here.\nThough the author has had little success in attempting to solve the systems\nin this section himself, it is hoped that their exposition will be useful to others.\n\n6.1\n\nAssociative 3-folds invariant under a subgroup of\nR \u00d7 U(1)2\n\nWe may decompose R7 \u223c\n= R \u2295 C3 , and so the action of R \u00d7 U(1)2 on R7 may be\nwritten as:\n(x1 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (x1 + c, ei\u03c61 z1 , ei\u03c62 z2 , e\u2212i(\u03c61 +\u03c62 ) z3 ),\n\nc, \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 R.

Moreover, M does not lie in {x} \u00d7 C3 for any x \u2208\nR, as long as not both \u03bc and \u03bd are zero, and (34)-(36) imply that Im(z1 z2 z3 ) =\nA, where A is a real constant.\nProof: We only need to prove the last sentence in the statement above. We\ndeduce immediately from (33) that x1 is constant in the direction transverse to\nthe group action, though it is changing along the group action (as long as not\nboth \u03bc and \u03bd are zero), which means that M does not lie in {x} \u00d7 C3 for any\nreal constant x in this case. We also note from (34)-(36) that\nd\n(z1 z2 z3 ) = \u2212\u03bb(|z2 |2 |z3 |2 + |z3 |2 |z1 |2 + |z1 |2 |z2 |2 ),\ndt\nwhich is real, therefore Im(z1 z2 z3 ) is a real constant.\n\n\u0003\n\nThere are two trivial cases which may be solved immediately.\nFirstly, suppose \u03bb = 0. This is not geometrically interesting since it implies\nthat G contains all possible translations in the first coordinate.

The\nexpression in brackets above defines a holomorphic curve in C3 .\nThe other case is when \u03bc = \u03bd = 0. This forces c = 0 in G, so there is\nno translation action in G, which means that M will be an embedded U(1)2 invariant SL 3-fold as studied in [2, \u00a7III.3.A]:\nM = {(x1 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2208 R7 : x1 = x, Im(z1 z2 z3 ) = A,\n\n|z1 |2 \u2212 |z3 |2 = B, |z2 |2 \u2212 |z3 |2 = C}\n\nfor some x, A, B, C \u2208 R.\n\n6.2\n\nU(1)2 -invariant coassociative cones\n\nWe consider coassociative 4-folds invariant both under the action of U(1)2 on\nthe C3 component of R7 \u223c\n= R \u2295 C3 and under dilations.\n18\n\n\fDefinition 6.3 Let R+ denote the group of positive real numbers under multiplication.

Moreover, |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 + |z4 |2 is a constant\nwhich can be taken to be 1 and Im(z1 z2 z3 z4 ) = A for some real constant A.\nProof: It is clear from (43)-(46) that |z1 |2 + . . . + |z4 |2 is a constant and that we\ncan take this constant to be 1 without loss of generality. Furthermore,\nd\n(z1 z2 z3 z4 ) = a1 |z2 z3 z4 |2 + a2 |z3 z4 z1 |2 + a3 |z4 z1 z2 |2 + a4 |z1 z2 z3 |2 ,\ndt\nwhich is purely real. Therefore Im(z1 z2 z3 z4 ) = A is constant. Theorem 3.6 only\ngives existence of solutions of t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) for some \u01eb > 0. However, by the same\nargument as in the proof of Theorem 4.2, solutions exist for all t \u2208 R, using the\nboundedness of the functions involved.\n\u0003\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgements I am indebted to Dominic Joyce for his help with this\nresearch project.
