We consider this extension for any\nfunctor on the category Comp and investigate which properties it preserves from the\ndefinition it preserves from the definition of normal functor. We investigate as well some\ntopological properties of such extension.\n\nIntroduction. The general theory of functors acting in the category Comp of compact\nHausdorff spaces (compacta) and continuous mappings was founded by E.V. Shchepin [15]. He\ndistinguished some elementary properties of such functors and defined the notion of normal\nfunctor that has become very fruitful. The class of normal functors includes many classical\nconstructions: the hyperspace exp, the functor of probability measures P , the power functor\nand many other functors (see [13],[9] for more details). But some important functors do not\nsatisfy some of the properties from the Shchepin list. Omitting some properties we obtain wider\nclasses of functors such as weakly normal functors and almost normal functors.\nThe properties from the definition of normal functor could be easily generalized for the functors on the category T ych of Tychonov spaces and continuous maps. Let us remark that T ych\ncontains Comp as a subcategory. A.Chigogidze defined for each normal functor on the category\nComp an extension which is a normal functor on the category T ych [6]. This extension could\nbe considered for any functor on the category Comp. But the situation is more complicated for\nwider classes of functors. For example, the extension of the projective power functor (which\nis weakly normal) does not preserve embeddings, which makes such extension useless (see for\n1\n\n\fexample [13], p.67). However, if we apply the Chigogidze extension to such weakly normal functors as the functor O of order-preserving functionals, the functor G of inclusion hyperspaces,\nthe superextension, we obtain functors on the category T ych which preserve embeddings.\nThe main aim of this paper is to investigate which properties from the definition of normal\nfunctor are preserved by Chigogidze extension, specially we concentrate our attention on the\npreserving of embeddings. The results devoted to this problem are contained in Section 2.\nWe define in this section the 1-preimages preserving property which is crucial for preserving of\nembeddings. In Section 3 we consider which functors have the 1-preimages preserving property.\nT.Banakh and R.Cauty obtained topological classification of the Chigogidze extension of\nthe functor of probability measures for separable metric spaces. We generalize this result for\nconvex functors in Section 4.\n1. All spaces are assumed to be Tychonov, all mappings are continuous. All functors are\nassumed to be covariant. In the present paper we will consider functors acting in two categories:\nthe category T ych and its subcategory Comp.\nLet us recall the definition of normal functor. A functor F : Comp \u2192 Comp is called\nmonomorphic (epimorphic) if it preserves embeddings (surjections). For a monomorphic functor\nF and an embedding i : A \u2192 X we shall identify the space F (A) and the subspace F (i)(F (A)) \u2282\nF (X).\nA monomorphic functor F is said to be preimage-preserving if for each map f : X \u2192 Y and\neach closed subset A \u2282 Y we have (F (f ))\u22121(F (A)) = F (f \u22121 (A)).\nFor a monomorphic functor F the intersection-preserving property is defined as follows:\nF (\u2229{X\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 A}) = \u2229{F (X\u03b1 ) | \u03b1 \u2208 A} for every family {X\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 A} of closed subsets of X.\nA functor F is called continuous if it preserves the limits of inverse systems S = {X\u03b1 , p\u03b2\u03b1 , A}\nover a directed set A. Let us also note that for any continuous functor F : Comp \u2192 Comp\nthe map F : C(X, Y ) \u2192 C(F X, F Y ) (the space C(X, Y ) is considered with the compact-open\ntopology) is continuous.\nFinally, a functor F is called weight-preserving if w(X) = w(F (X)) for every infinite X \u2208\nComp.\nA functor F is called normal [15] if it is continuous, monomorphic, epimorphic, preserves\nweight,intersections,preimages,singletons and the empty space. A functor F is said to be weakly\nnormal (almost normal) if it satisfies all the properties from the definition of a normal functor\nexcepting perhaps the preimage-preserving property (epimorphness)(see [13] for more details).\nSimilarly, one can define the same properties for a functor F : T ych \u2192 T ych with the only\ndifference that the property of preserving surjections is replaced by the property of sending\nk-covering maps to surjections (recall that f : X \u2192 Y is a k-covering map if for any compact\nset B \u2282 Y there exists a compact set A \u2282 X with f (A) = B) (see [13], Def.2.7.1).\nA.Chigogidze defined an extension construction of a functor in Comp onto T ych the following way [6].\n\nFor any normal functor F : Comp \u2192 Comp and any X \u2208 T ych the\n2\n\n\fspace F\u03b2 (X) = {a \u2208 F (\u03b2X)|there exists a compact set A \u2282 X with a \u2208 F (A)} is considered\nwith the topology induced from F (\u03b2X), where \u03b2X is the Stone-Cech compactification of the\nspace X. Next, given any continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y between Tychonov spaces, put\nF\u03b2 (f ) = F (\u03b2f )|F\u03b2 (X) . Then F\u03b2 forms a covariant functor in the category T ych. Chigogidze\nshowed that in case F is normal, the functor F\u03b2 is also normal.\n2. Let us modify the Chigogidze construction for any functor F : Comp \u2192 Comp. For X \u2208\nT ych we put F\u03b2 (X) = {a \u2208 F (\u03b2X)|there exists a compact set A \u2282 X with a \u2208 F (iA )(F (A))}\nwhere by iA we denote the natural embedding iA : A \u0592\u2192 X (we do not assume that the map\nF (iA ) is an embedding). Evidently F\u03b2 preserves empty set and one-point space iff F does.\nNow we consider the problem when F\u03b2 preserves embeddings. Extension of any normal\nfunctor preserves embeddings, but, if we drop the preimage preserving property, the situation\ncould be different. However, the examples from the introduction show that the preimagepreserving property is not necessary. We define some weaker property which will give us a\nnecessary and sufficient condition.\nDefinition 1. We say that a monomorphic functor F : Comp \u2192 Comp preserves 1-preimages,\nif for any f : X \u2192 Y , where X, Y \u2208 Comp, any closed A \u2282 Y such that f |f \u22121 (A) is a\nhomeomorphism, we have that (F f )\u22121 (F A) = F (f \u22121 (A)). (Let us remark it is equivalent to\nthe condition that the map F f | (F f )\u22121(F A) is a homeomorphism.)\nLet us note that this definition was independently introduced by T.Banakh and A.Kucharski\n[3].\nProposition 1. If F is a monomorphic functor that preserves 1-preimages in the class of open\nmappings, then F preserves 1-preimages.\nProof. Take any mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f |f \u22121 (A) is a homeomorphism for some closed\nsubset A \u2282 Y . Let i1 : X \u2192 X \u00d7 Y be an embedding defined by the formula i1 (x) = (x, f (x)).\nDenote Z = X \u00d7 Y /\u03b5, where the relation \u03b5 is given by \u03b5 = {prY\u22121(a)|a \u2208 A} (prY : X \u00d7 Y is\nthe respective projection). Let q : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Z be the quotient mapping. The map h : Z \u2192 Y\ngiven by the conditions h(z) = y for any z = (x, y) \u2208 Z \\ q(X \u00d7 A) and h(z) = a for any\nz = q(prY\u22121 (a)), a \u2208 A, is open and satisfies the following two conditions: prY = h \u25e6 q, h|h\u22121 (A) is\na homeomorphism. Apparently, the map i = q \u25e6 i1 is an embedding, moreover, h \u25e6 i = f . Since\nF preserves 1-preimages in the class of open mappings, we have (F h)\u22121 (F A) = F (h\u22121 (A)),\nwhich gives us the equality (F f )\u22121(F A) = F (f \u22121 (A)).\nProposition 2. If F is a monomorphic functor that preserves 1-preimages, then F\u03b2 preserves\nembeddings.\nProof. Take any embedding f : X \u2192 Y . Then the map F\u03b2 (f ) is closed as the restriction of a\nclosed map onto a full preimage and, moreover, injective, hence an embedding.\n3\n\n\fFor any X \u2208 T ych and any its compactification bX we can define Fb (X) = {a \u2208 F (bX)|\nthere is a compact subset A \u2282 X with a \u2208 F (A)} \u2282 F (bX) and consider it with the respective\nsubspace topology.\nCorollary 1. If F is a monomorphic, 1-preimage-preserving functor, then F\u03b2 (X) \u223c\n= Fb (X) for\nany Tychonov space X and its compactification bX.\nProposition 3. If F is monomorphic, preserves 1-preimages and weight, then F\u03b2 preserves\nweight.\nProof. The statement follows from the previous corollary and the fact that for any X \u2208 T ych\nthere exists its compactification bX which has the same weight as X.\nAs the following proposition shows, the reverse implication to that of Proposition 2 also\nholds.\nProposition 4. Let F be a continuous functor such that F\u03b2 preserves embeddings. Then F\npreserves 1-preimages.\nProof. Assume the contrary. Then there exist a map f : X \u2192 Y and a closed subset A \u2282 Y\nsuch that f |f \u22121 (A) is a homeomorphism and F f \u22121(F A) 6= F (f \u22121(A)). Hence we can choose\n\u03bd \u2208 F A and \u03bc \u2208 F X\\F (f \u22121(A)) such that F f (\u03bc) = \u03bd. We will construct a space S \u2208 T ych\nand its compactification \u03b3S such that the map F\u03b2 (idS ) : F\u03b2 (S) \u2192 F\u03b2 (\u03b3S) = F (\u03b3S) is not an\nembedding, where idS : S \u2192 (\u03b3S) is an identity embedding.\nFirst put Z = X \u00d7\u03b1N, where the space of natural numbers N is considered with the discrete\ntopology and \u03b1N = N\u222a{\u03be} is the one-point compactification of N. Define a continuous function\ng : Z \u2192 Y by g(x, n) = f (x) for any x \u2208 X, n \u2208 \u03b1N. Let T = Z/\u03b5 be a quotient space, where \u03b5\nis an equivalence relation defined by its classes of equivalence {{x}|x \u2208 (X \\ A) \u00d7N} \u222a{g \u22121 (y) \u2229\nX \u00d7 {\u03be}|y \u2208 Y \\ A} \u222a {{a} \u00d7 \u03b1N|a \u2208 A}. By q : Z \u2192 T we denote the respective quotient\nmapping. Then the map h : T \u2192 Y defined by the equality g = h \u25e6 q is continuous. The\nset D = q(X \u00d7 {\u03be}) is compact as a continuous image of a compact set and moreover h|D is\none-to-one, hence a homeomorphism between D and Y . We denote by j : Y \u2192 T the inverse\nembedding. Also, for any n \u2208 N the space Sn = q(X \u00d7 {n}) is homeomorphic to X and we\ndenote by jn : X \u2192 T the inverse embedding. Then we have h \u25e6 jn = f . Finally note that T is\na compactification of the space S = T \\q((X \\ A) \u00d7 {\u03be}).\nPut \u03bcn = F (jn )(\u03bc) for n \u2208 N. The sequence jn converges to j \u25e6 f in the space C(X, T ).\nSince F is continuous, the sequence F (jn ) converges to F (j \u25e6f ) in the space C(F X, F T ). Hence\nthe sequence \u03bcn converges to F (j \u25e6 f )(\u03bc) = F (j)(\u03bd) \u2208 F (q(A \u00d7 \u03b1N)).\nNow consider F\u03b2 (S) as a subspace of F (\u03b2S). There exists a map s1 : S \u2192 X such that\ns1 \u25e6 jn = id X . Let s : \u03b2S \u2192 X be the extension of s1 . Then F s(\u03bcn ) = \u03bc \u2208\n/ F (f \u22121 (A)).\nThen the sequence \u03bcn does not converge to any element of F (q(A \u00d7 \u03b1N)). The proposition is\nproved.\n4\n\n\fPropositions 2 and 4 yield the following\nTheorem 1. For any continuous monomorphic functor F the functor F\u03b2 preserves embeddings\nif and only if F preserves 1-preimages.\nThe proof of the following proposition is a routine checking and we omit it.\nProposition 5. Let F : Comp \u2192 Comp be a functor.\n1) if F preserves embeddings, 1-preimages and intersections then F\u03b2 preserves intersections;\n1) if F preserves embeddings and preimages then F\u03b2 preserves preimages;\n3) if F preserves surjections then F\u03b2 sends k-covering maps to surjections;\nNow let us consider continuity of the Chigogidze extension. The following example shows\nthat in the absence of the preimage-preserving property of the functor F , it is difficult to speak\nof continuity of F\u03b2 , since even the extension of such known weakly normal functor as G does\nnot possess it.\nExample. Let us define the inclusion hyperspace functor G. Recall that a closed subset\nA \u2208 exp2 X, where X \u2208 Comp is called an inclusion hyperspace, if for every A \u2208 A and\nevery B \u2208 exp X the inclusion A \u2282 B implies B \u2208 A. Then GX is the space of all inclusion\nhyperspaces with the induced from exp2 X topology. For any map f : X \u2192 Y define Gf :\nGX \u2192 GY by Gf (A) = {B \u2208 exp Y |f (A) \u2282 B f or some A \u2208 A}. The functor G is weakly\nnormal (see [13] for more details). In the next section we will see that the functor G preserves\n1-preimages.\nLet us show that the functor G\u03b2 is not continuous. Consider the following inverse system. For any n \u2208 N put Xn = N \u00d7 {1, ..., n} (here the spaces N and {1, ..., n} are considered with the discrete topology). Define pm\nn : Xm \u2192 Xn , where m \u2265 n, the following way:\nm\npm\nn (x, k) = (x, min{k, n}). We obtained the inverse system S = {Xm , pn , N}. Then the limit\n\nspace X = lim S is homeomorphic to the space N \u00d7 A (here A = \u03b1N = N \u222a {\u03be} is the one-point\ncompactification of N, i.e. a convergent sequence; also we put \u03be to be greater than any natural\nnumber), and the limit projections pn : X \u2192 Xn can be given by pn (x, k) = (x, min{k, n}),\nk \u2208 A. The continuity of G\u03b2 means that lim G\u03b2 (pn ) : G\u03b2 (lim S) \u2192 lim G\u03b2 (S) is a homeomorphism. Here both G\u03b2 (lim S) and lim G\u03b2 (S) can be thought as subspaces of G(bX), where b is\na compactification of X with the property bX = lim \u03b2S.\nNow we will construct K \u2208 lim G\u03b2 (S) which does not belong to lim G\u03b2 (pn )(G\u03b2 (lim S)).\nConsider the space X imbedded into its compactification bX. For any n \u2208 A\\{\u03be} put Kn =\n{1, ..., n} \u00d7 {n}. If we want to obtain a closed family of sets, the set K\u03be = N \u00d7 {\u03be} must be\ne = {Kn }n\u2208N . Now put K = {B \u2282 bX|Kn \u2282 B for some n \u2208 A}. Then\nadded to the family K\nK \u2208 lim G\u03b2 (S). However, there is apparently no element C \u2208 G\u03b2 (lim S) with lim G\u03b2 (pn )(C) =\nK. Hence, lim G\u03b2 (pn ), being not surjective, is not a homeomorphism.\n\n5\n\n\f3. We start this section with definitions of some functors we deal with in this paper. Let X\nbe compactum. By C(X) we denote the Banach space of all continuous functions \u03c6 : X \u2192 R\nwith the usual sup-norm. We consider C(X) with natural order. Let \u03bd : C(X) \u2192 R be a\nfunctional (we do not suppose a priori that \u03bd is linear or continuous). We say that \u03bd is 1)\nnon-expanding if |\u03bd(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03bd(\u03c8)| \u2264 d(\u03c6, \u03c8) for all \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 C(X); 2) weakly additive if for any\nfunction \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) and any c \u2208 R we have \u03bd(\u03c6 + cX ) = \u03bd(\u03c6) + c (by cX we denote the\nconstant function); 3) preserves order if for any \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 C(X) such that \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c8 the inequality\n\u03bd(\u03c6) \u2264 \u03bd(\u03c8) holds; 4) linear if for any \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R and for any two functions \u03c8, \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) we\nhave \u03bd(\u03b1\u03c6 + \u03b2\u03c8) = \u03b1\u03bd(\u03c6) + \u03b2\u03bd(\u03c8).\nNow for any space X denote V X =\n\nQ\n\n\u03c6\u2208C(X) [min \u03c6, max \u03c6].\n\nFor any mapping f : X \u2192 Y\n\ndefine the map V f as follows: V f (\u03bd)(\u03c6) = \u03bd(\u03c6 \u25e6 f ) for every \u03bd \u2208 V X, \u03c6 \u2208 C(Y ). Then V is\na covariant functor in the category Comp [11].\nLet us remark that the space V X could be considered as the space of all functionals\n\u03bd : C(X) \u2192 R with the only condition min \u03c6(X) \u2264 \u03bd(\u03c6) \u2264 max \u03c6(X) for every \u03bd \u2208 V X, \u03c6 \u2208\nC(Y ). By EX we denote the subset of V X defined by the condition 1) (non-expanding functionals; see [5] for more details), by EAX the subset defined by the conditions 1) and 2). The\nconditions 2) and 3) define the subset OX (order-preserving functionals, see [10]); finally, the\nconditions 3) and 4) define the well-known subset P X (probability measures, see for example\n[?]). For a map f : X \u2192 Y the mapping F f , where F is one of P , O, EA, E, is defined as the\nrestriction of V f on F X. It is easy to check that the constructions P , O, EA and E define\nsubfunctors of V . It is known that the functors O and E are weakly normal (see [10] and [5]).\nUsing the same arguments one can check that EA is weakly normal too.\nThe question arises naturally which of defined above functors have the property of preserving\n1-preimages. It is easy to check that we have the inclusions P X \u2282 OX \u2282 EAX \u2282 EX \u2282 V X.\nWe will show that the functor EA satisfies this property and E does not. Since subfunctors\ninherit the 1-preimages preserving property, this is the complete answer. Let us also remark\nthat the results of [11] and [12] show that many other known functors could be considered\nas subfunctors of EA, for example the superextension, the hyperspace functor, the inclusion\nhyperspace functor etc. This shows that the class of functors with the 1-preimages preserving\nproperty is wide enough.\nWe start with a definition of an AR-compactum. Recall that a compactum X is called an\nabsolute retract (briefly X \u2208 AR) if for any embedding i : X \u2192 Z of X into compactum Z the\nimage i(X) is a retract of Z.\nThe next lemma will be needed in the following discussion.\nLemma 1. Let F be a monomorphic subfunctor of V which preserves intersections and B be\na closed subset of a compactum X. Then \u03bd \u2208 F B iff \u03bd(\u03c61 ) = \u03bd(\u03c62 ) for each \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 C(X)\nsuch that \u03c61 |B = \u03c62 |B .\n6\n\n\fProof. Necessity. The inclusion \u03bd \u2208 F B \u2282 F X means that there exists \u03bd0 \u2208 F B with\nF (iB )(\u03bd0 ) = \u03bd, where iB : B \u2192 X is a natural embedding. Hence, for any \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 C(X) such\nthat \u03c61 |B = \u03c62 |B we have \u03bd(\u03c61 ) = \u03bd0 (\u03c61 \u25e6 iB ) = \u03bd0 (\u03c62 \u25e6 iB ) = \u03bd(\u03c62 ).\nSufficiency. We can find an embedding j : B \u0592\u2192 Y , where Y \u2208 AR. Define Z to be the\nquotient space of the disjoint union X \u222a Y obtained by attaching X and Y by B. Denote by\nr : Z \u2192 Y the retraction mapping.\nNow take any \u03bd \u2208 F X \u2282 F Z with the property \u03bd(\u03c61 ) = \u03bd(\u03c62 ) for each \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 C(X)\nsuch that \u03c61 |B = \u03c62 |B . We claim that F (r)(\u03bd) = \u03bd. Indeed, take any \u03c6 \u2208 C(Z). Then\nF (r)(\u03bd)(\u03c6) = \u03bd(\u03c6 \u25e6 r) = \u03bd(\u03c6) since \u03c6 \u25e6 r|Y = \u03c6|Y . Hence, \u03bd \u2208 F X \u2229 F Y = F B.\nProposition 6. The functor EA preserves 1-preimages.\nProof. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a continuous open map between compacta X and Y and B be a closed\nsubset of Y such that f |f \u22121 (B) is a homeomorphism. Choose any \u03bd \u2208 EA(B) \u2282 EA(Y ). Using\nLemma 1 we can define \u03bc0 \u2208 EA(f \u22121 (B)) by the condition \u03bc0 (\u03c6) = \u03bd(\u03c8) for each \u03c6 \u2208 C(X)\nand \u03c8 \u2208 C(Y ) such that \u03c8 \u25e6 f |f \u22121(B) = \u03c6|f \u22121 (B) .\nIt is enough to show that for each \u03bc \u2208 (EA(f ))\u22121 (\u03bd) we have \u03bc = \u03bc0 . Suppose the\ncontrary. Then there exist \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) and \u03c8 \u2208 C(Y ) such that \u03c8 \u25e6 f |f \u22121 (B) = \u03c6|f \u22121 (B)\nand \u03bc(\u03c6) 6= \u03bd(\u03c8). We can suppose that \u03bc(\u03c6) > \u03bd(\u03c8). Define a function \u03c8 \u2032 : Y \u2192 R by\n\u03c8 \u2032 (y) = max \u03c6f \u22121 (y) for any y \u2208 Y . The function \u03c8 \u2032 is continuous since f is open. Put\n\u03be = (\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 D) \u25e6 f , where D = sup{max \u03c6f \u22121 (y) \u2212 min \u03c6f \u22121 (y)|y \u2208 Y }. Then d(\u03be, \u03c6) \u2264 D but\n\u03bc(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03be) = \u03bc(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03bc((\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 D) \u25e6 f ) = \u03bc(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03bd(\u03c8 \u2032 ) + D = \u03bc(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03bd(\u03c8) + D > D and we\nobtain a contradiction. The proof is similar for the case \u03bc(\u03c6) < \u03bd(\u03c8).\nHence, EA preserves 1-preimages in the class of open mappings, and, by Proposition 1, we\nare done.\nProposition 7. The functor of nonexpanding functionals E does not preserve 1-preimages.\nProof. Consider the mapping f : X \u2192 Y between discrete spaces X = {x, y, s, t} and Y =\n{a, b, c} which is defined as follows: f (x) = a, f (y) = b, f (s) = f (t) = c. Put A = {\u03c6 \u2208\nC(X)|\u03c6(s) = \u03c6(t)}. Define the functional \u03bd : A \u2192 R as follows: \u03bd(\u03c6) = min{\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)} if\n\u03c6|{x,y} \u2265 0, \u03bd(\u03c6) = max{\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)} if \u03c6|{x,y} \u2264 0, and \u03bd(\u03c6) = 0 otherwise. One can check that\n\u03bd is nonexpanding. Now take the function \u03c8 : X \u2192 R defined as follows \u03c8(x) = 1, \u03c8(y) = \u22121,\n\u03c8(s) = 0, \u03c8(t) = 4. One can check that we can extend \u03bd to a nonexpanding functional on\nA \u222a {\u03c8} by defining its value on \u03c8 to be \u22121. This new functional can be further extended\nto a nonexpanding functional on the whole C(X) [5]. Denote this extension by \u03bde. Evidently,\nEf (e\n\u03bd ) \u2208 E({a, b}). On the other hand, \u03bde \u2208\n/ E({x, y}).\n\n4. We consider in this section a monomorphic continuous functor F which preserves intersections, weight, empty set, point and 1-preimages. We investigate topology of the space\n7\n\n\fF\u03b2 Y where Y is a metrizable separable non-compact space. We consider Y as a dense subset of\nmetrizable compactum X. It follows from Corollary 1 that F\u03b2 Y is homeomorphic to Fb Y \u2282 F X\n(where X is considered as a compactification bY of Y ) and in what follows we identify F\u03b2 Y\nwith Fb Y . Also, the properties we impose on F imply that F\u03b2 Y is a dense proper subspace of\nF X.\nT.Banakh proved in [1] that F\u03b2 Y is F\u03c3 -subset of F X when Y is locally compact; F\u03b2 Y is\nF\u03c3\u03b4 -subset when Y is G\u03b4 -subset. If Y is not a G\u03b4 -subset, then F\u03b2 Y is not analytic.\nWe consider in the Hilbert cube Q = [\u22121, 1]\u03c9 the following subsets: \u03a3 = {(ti ) \u2208 Q| supi |ti | <\n1}; \u03c3 = {(ti ) \u2208 Q|ti 6= 0for finitely many of i} and \u03a3\u03c9 \u2282 Q\u03c9 \u223c\n= Q.\nIt is shown in [2] that any analytic P\u03b2 Y is homeomorphic to one of the spaces \u03c3, \u03a3 or \u03a3\u03c9 .\nWe generalize this result for convex functors.\nBy Conv we denote the category of convex compacta (compact convex subsets of locally\nconvex topological linear spaces) and affine maps. Let U : Conv \u2192 Comp be the forgetful\nfunctor. A functor F is called convex if there exists a functor F \u2032 : Comp \u2192 Conv such that\nF = UF \u2032 . It is easy to see that the functors V , E, EA, O and P are convex. It is shown in [14]\nthat for each convex functor F there exists a unique natural transformation l : P \u2192 F such\nthat the map lX : P X \u2192 F X is an affine embedding.\nLemma 2. P\u03b2 Y = (lX)\u22121 (F\u03b2 Y ).\nProof. Take any measure \u03bc \u2208 P (X) such that lX(\u03bc) = \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 F\u03b2 Y . By the definition of F\u03b2 Y\nit means that \u03bc\u2032 \u2208 F B for some compactum B \u2282 Y . We will show that \u03bc \u2208 P B \u2282 P\u03b2 Y .\nChoose an absolute retract T which contains B and define Z to be the quotient space of\nthe disjoint union X \u222a T obtained by attaching X and T by B. By r : Z \u2192 T denote the\nretraction. Since l is a natural transformation and r is an identity on T \u2282 Z, we have that\nF (r) \u25e6 lZ(\u03bc) = \u03bc\u2032 = lT \u25e6 P (r)(\u03bc). Hence, \u03bc = P (r)(\u03bc) \u2208 P (T ) due to injectivity of lZ.\nTherefore, \u03bc \u2208 P X \u2229 P T = P B. The lemma is proved.\nWe need some notions from infinite-dimensional topology. See [4] for more details. All\nspaces are assumed to be metrizable and separable. A closed subset A of a compactum T is\ncalled Z-set if there exists a homotopy H : T \u00d7 [0; 1] \u2192 T such that H |T \u00d7{0} = id T \u00d7{0} and\nH(T \u00d7 (0, 1]) \u2229 A = \u2205; a subset B of T is called \u03c3Z-set if it is contained in countable union of\nZ-sets of T . In what follows we will use the following facts.\nWe don't know if F\u03b2 Y is a \u03c3Z-set in F X for any convex functor F . Thus, we introduce\nsome additional property. We consider the compactum F X as a convex subset of a locally\nconvex linear space.\nDefinition 2. A convex functor F : Comp \u2192 Comp is called strongly convex if for each\ncompactum X, each closed subset A \u2282 X we have (F X \\ F A) \u2229 affF A = \u2205.\nProposition 8. Each convex subfunctor F of the functor V is strongly convex.\n8\n\n\fProof. By Lemma 1 any element from affF A takes the same value at any two functions from\nC(X) which coincide on A, which is not true for functionals from F X \\ F A.\nProposition 9. Let F be a strongly convex functor. Then F\u03b2 Y is a \u03c3Z-set in F X.\nProof. Take any y \u2208 X\\Y . Then F\u03b2 Y \u2282 F\u03b2 (X\\{y}), and X\\{y} can be represented as\na countable union of its compact subsets An with the property that An \u2282 intAn+1 , hence,\nF\u03b2 (X\\{y}) = \u222an\u2208N F (An ). Let us show that all F (An ) are Z-sets in F X. Take any \u03bd \u2208\nF X \\ F\u03b2 (X \\ {y}) and the set Z = {t\u03bd + (1 \u2212 t)\u03bc|t \u2208 (0, 1], \u03bc \u2208 F\u03b2 (X \\ {y})}. Since F is\nstrongly convex, we have Z \u2229 F\u03b2 (X \\ {y}) = \u2205. Since Z is convex and dense subset of F X, there\nexists a homotopy H : F X \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 F X such that H(F X \u00d7 (0, 1]) \u2282 Z (see, for example, Ex.\n12, 13 to section 1.2 in [4]).\nNow, we are going to obtain the complete topological classification of the pair (F X, F\u03b2 Y )\nwhere X is a metrizable compactum and Y its proper dense G\u03b4 -subset. We need some characterization theorems.\nTheorem A. [8] Let C be an infinite-dimensional dense \u03c3Z convex subspace of a a convex\nmetrizable compactum K, and additionally let C be a countable union of its finite-dimensional\ncompact subspaces. Then the pair (K, C) is homeomorphic to (Q, \u03c3).\nTheorem B. [7] Let K be a convex metrizable compactum, and let C \u2282 K be its proper dense\n\u03c3Z convex \u03c3-compact subspace that contains an infinite-dimensional convex compactum. Then\nthe pair (K, C) is homeomorphic to the pair (Q, \u03a3).\nThe following theorem follows from 5.3.6, 5.2.6, 3.1.10 in [4].\nTheorem C. Let K be a convex compact subset locally convex linear metric space, and let\nC \u2282 K be its proper dense \u03c3Z convex F\u03c3\u03b4 subspace such that K \\C)\u2229affC = \u2205, and additionally\nthere exists a continuous embedding h : Q \u2192 K such that h\u22121 (C) = \u03a3\u03c9 . Then the pair (K, C)\nis homeomorphic to the pair (Q, \u03a3\u03c9 ).\nTheorem 2. Let F be a strongly convex functor, X is a metrizable compactum and Y is its\nproper dense G\u03b4 -subset. The pair (F X, F\u03b2 Y ) is homeomorphic to\n1. (Q, \u03c3), if Y is discrete subspace of X and F (n) is finite-dimensional for each n \u2208 N;\n2. (Q, \u03a3), if Y is discrete subspace of X and F (n) is infinite-dimensional for some n \u2208 N\nor Y is locally compact non-discrete subspace of X;\n3. (Q, \u03a3\u03c9 ), if Y is not locally compact.\n\n9\n\n\fProof. It is easy to see that F\u03b2 Y is a convex subset of F X.\nWe prove the first assertion. Since X is metrizable, Y is countable. We can represent\n\u221e\nY = \u222a\u221e\nn=1 Yn where |Yn | = n. Then F\u03b2 Y = \u222an=1 F Yn . Since P Yn could be considered as an\n\nn \u2212 1-dimensional subspace of F Yn , the space F\u03b2 Y is infinite-dimensional. Moreover, F\u03b2 Y is\na \u03c3Z-set by Proposition 9. Since each F Yn is a finite-dimensional compactum, we can apply\nTheorem A.\nWe prove the second assertion. In the case when Y is discrete, F Yn is infinite-dimensional\nconvex compactum for some n. When Y is not discrete, it contains an infinite compactum Y \u2032\nand F Y \u2032 is infinite-dimensional convex compactum. We apply Proposition 9 and Theorem B.\nFor the third assertion, note that the pair (P X, P\u03b2 Y ) is homeomorphic to (Q, \u03a3\u03c9 ) [2]. Since\nF is strongly convex, we have (F X \\ F\u03b2 Y ) \u2229 affF\u03b2 Y = \u2205. We apply Lemma 2, Proposition 9\nand Theorem C.\nCorollary 2. Suppose that F is a strongly convex functor. Then for any separable metrizable\nspace X\n1) X \u223c\n= Qf in case F (n) is finite-dimensional for any n \u2208 N or\n= N implies F\u03b2 (X) \u223c\n\u223c \u03a3 otherwise;\nF\u03b2 (X) =\n2) if X is locally compact non-discrete and non-compact then F\u03b2 (X) \u223c\n= \u03a3;\n3) if X is topologically complete not locally compact then F\u03b2 (X) \u223c\n= \u03a3\u03c9 .\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
