A Maximum Entropy Model For Part-Of-Speech Tagging
This paper presents a statistical model which trains from a corpus annotated with Part-Of-Speech tags and assigns them to previously unseen text with state-of-the-art accuracy(96.6%).
The model can be classified as a Maximum Entropy model and simultaneously uses many contextual "features" to predict the POS tag.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the use of specialized features to model difficult tagging decisions, discusses the corpus consistency problems discovered during the implementation of these features, and proposes a training strategy that mitigates these problems.
We assume that the tag of a word is independent of the tags of all preceding words given the tags of the previous two words.
We release a publicly available maximum entropy tagger.
