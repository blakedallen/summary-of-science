Automatic Retrieval and Clustering of Similar Words
Bootstrapping semantics from text is one of the greatest challenges in natural language learning.
We first define a word similarity measure based on the distributional pattern of words.
The similarity measure allows us to construct a thesaurus using a parsed corpus.
We then present a new evaluation methodology for the automatically constructed thesaurus.
The evaluation results show that the thesaurns is significantly closer to WordNet than Roget Thesaurus is.
We use dependency relation as word features to compute word similarities from large corpora.
