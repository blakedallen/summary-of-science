A Phrase-Based Joint Probability Model For Statistical Machine Translation
We present a joint probability model for statistical machine translation, which automatically learns word and phrase equivalents from bilingual corpora.
Translations produced with parameters estimated using the joint model are more accurate than translations produced using IBM Model 4.
We propose a joint probability model which searches the phrase alignment space, simultaneously learning translations lexicons for words and phrases without consideration of potentially suboptimal word alignments and heuristics for phrase extraction.
