Advances In Domain Independent Linear Text Segmentation
This paper describes a method for linear text segmentation which is twice as accurate and over seven times as fast as the state-of-the-art (Reynar, 1998).
Inter-sentence similarity is replaced by rank in the local context.
Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.
We design an artificial dataset, built by concatenating short pieces of texts that have been extracted from the Brown corpus.
