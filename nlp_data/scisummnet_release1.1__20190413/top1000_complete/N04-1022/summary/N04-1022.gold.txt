Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding For Statistical Machine Translation
We present Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding for statistical machine translation.
This statistical approach aims to minimize expected loss of translation errors under loss functions that measure translation performance.
We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings, word-to-word alignments from an MT system, and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences.
We report the performance of the MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English translation task.
Our results show that MBR decoding can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions.
The corresponding minimum Bayes risk (MBR) procedure maximizes the expected similarity score of a system's translations relative to the model's distribution over possible translations.
In SMT, MBR decoding allows to minimize the loss of the output for a single translation system. MBR is generally implemented by re-ranking an N best list of translations produced by a first pass decoder.
