Integrating Multiple Knowledge Sources For Detection And Correction Of Repairs In Human-Computer Dialog
We have analyzed 607 sentences of spontaneous human-computer speech data containing repairs, drawn from a total corpus of 10,718 sentences.
We present here criteria and techniques for automatically detecting the presence of a repair, its location, and making the appropriate correction.
The criteria involve integration of knowledge from several sources: pattern matching, syntactic and semantic analysis, and acoustics.
We are able to correctly identify 309 of 406 utterences containing nontrivial repairs, while 191 fluent utterances were incorrectly identified as containing repairs.
We speculate that acoustic information might be used to filter out false positives for canditate matching.
We find location of word fragments to be an invaluable cue to both the detection and correction of disfluencies.
