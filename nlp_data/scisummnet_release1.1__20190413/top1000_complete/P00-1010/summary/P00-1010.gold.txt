Robust Temporal Processing Of News
We introduce an annotation scheme for temporal expressions, and describe a method for resolving temporal expressions in print and broadcast news.
The system, which is based on both hand-crafted and machine-learnt rules, achieves an 83.2% accuracy (F-measure) against hand-annotated data.
Some initial steps towards tagging event chronologies are also described.
The main part of the system is a temporal expression tagger that employs finite state transducers based on hand-written rules.
We work on news and introduce an annotation scheme for temporal expressions, and a method for using explicit temporal expressions to assign activity times to the entirety of an article.
We attribute over half the errors of our baseline method to propagation of an incorrect event time to neighboring events.
