Using Encyclopedic Knowledge For Named Entity Disambiguation
We present a new method for detecting and disambiguating named entities in open domain text.
A disambiguation SVM kernel is trained to exploit the high coverage and rich structure of the knowledge encoded in an online encyclopedia.
The resulting model significantly outperforms a less informed baseline.
We measure similarity between the textual context of the NE mention and the Wikipedia categories of the candidate.
We use context matching to link noun phrase subjects into Wikipedia.
