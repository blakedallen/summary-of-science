			<S sid="8" ssid="8">Chinese sentences arc cx)mposed with string of characters without blanks to mark words.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">However the basic unit for sentence parsing and understanding is word.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Therefore the first step of processing Chinese sentences is to identify the words( i.e. segment the character strings of the sentences into word strings).</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">Most of the current Chinese natural language processing systems include a processor for word iden- tification.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">Also there are many word segmentation techniques been developed.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">Usually they use a lexicon with a large set of entries to match input sentences \[2,10,12,13,14,21\].</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">It is very often that there are many l~)ssible different successful matchings.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">Therefore the major focus for word identification were on thc resolu- tion of ambiguities.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">However many other important as- pects, such as what should be done, in what depth and what are considered to be the correct identifications were totally ignored.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">High identification rates are claimed to be achieved, but none of them were mea- sured under equal bases.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">There is no agreement in what extend words are considered to be correctly iden- tified.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">For instance, compounds occur very often in Chi- nese text, but none of the existing systems except ours pay much attention to identify them.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">Proper name is another type of words which cannot be listed exhaus- tively in the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">Therefore simple matching algo- rithms can not successfully identify either compounds or proper names.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">In this paper, we like to raise the ptx~blems and the difficulties in identifying words and suggest the possible solutions.</S>
