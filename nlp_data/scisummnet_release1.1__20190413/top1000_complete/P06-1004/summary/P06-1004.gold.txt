Minimum Cut Model For Spoken Lecture Segmentation
We consider the task of unsupervised lecture segmentation.
We formalize segmentation as a graph-partitioning task that optimizes the normalized cut criterion.
Our approach moves beyond localized comparisons and takes into account long-range cohesion dependencies.
Our results demonstrate that global analysis improves the segmentation accuracy and is robust in the presence of speech recognition errors.
We optimize a normalized minimum-cut criteria based on a variation of the cosine similarity between sentences.
Our problem is to find topical boundaries in transcripts of course lectures.
We create a corpus of course lectures segmented by four annotators, noting that the annotators operated at different levels of granularity.
