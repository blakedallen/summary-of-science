Building A Sense Tagged Corpus With Open Mind Word Expert
Open Mind Word Expert is an implemented active learning system for collecting word sense tagging from the general public over the Web.
It is available at http://teach-computers.org.
We expect the system to yield a large volume of high-quality training data at a much lower cost than the traditional method of hiring lexicographers.
We thus propose a Senseval-3 lexical sample activity where the training data is collected via Open Mind Word Expert.
If successful, the collection process can be extended to create the definitive corpus of word sense information.
Finally, in an effort related to the Wikipedia collection process, we implemente the Open Mind Word Expert system for collecting sense annotations from volunteer contributors over the Web.
we presented another interesting proposal which turns to Web users to produce sense-tagged corpora.
