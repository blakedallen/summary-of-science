A Study on Similarity and Relatedness Using Distributional and WordNet-based Approaches
This paper presents and compares WordNet-based and distributional similarity approaches.
The strengths and weaknesses of each approach regarding similarity and relatedness tasks are discussed, and a combination is presented.
Each of our methods independently provide the best results in their class on the RG and WordSim353 datasets, and a supervised combination of them yields the best published results on all datasets.
Finally, we pioneer cross-lingual similarity, showing that our methods are easily adapted for a cross-lingual task with minor losses.
We derive a WordNet-based measure using PageRank and combined it with several corpus based vector space models using SVMs.
Examining the relations between the words in each pair, we further split this dataset into similar pairs (WS-sim) and related pairs (WS-rel), where the former contains synonyms, antonyms, identical words and hyponyms/hypernyms and the latter capture other word relations.
