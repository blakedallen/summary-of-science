Let us establish& quot; adjacency& quot; (adj) with the values i: C immediately precedes 1{, and 2: C immediately follows H, Finally, let us introduce& quot; delimitation& quot; (lim) with the values i: C is the leftmost of all of the strings corresponding to dependents of H, and 2: C is the rightmost of of all of the dependents of H. For the sake of comparison, let us consider the following example which Pereira 1981 uses in order to illustrate Extraposition Grammar: (3) The mouse that the cat that likes fish chased squeaks, The following DRL-tree depicts the dependencies and the word order of this sentence by means of the attributes just defined: (4) (ILLOCUTION: assertion: adj &lt; l& gt; (PREDICATE: squeak: adj &lt; l& gt; (SUBJECT: mouse: adj &lt; l& gt; (DETERMINER: the: seq &lt; l& gt;) (ATTRIBUTE: chase: adj &lt; 2& gt; (OBJECT: that :lim &lt; l& gt;) (SUBJECT: cat: adj &lt; l& gt; (DETERMINER: the: adj &lt; l& gt;) (ATTRIBUTE: like: adj &lt; 2& gt; (SUBJECT: that :lim &lt; l& gt;) (OBJECT: fish: adj &lt; 2& gt;))))))); The projection of subtrees and their attributes yields the following constituent analysis of the input string: (5) the mouse that the cat that [e squeaks likes fish chased [adj &lt; l& gt; the [, mouse-~ [that the cat I seq &lt; l& gt; adj &lt; 2& gt;] that likes [] fish chased that [+ -- chased [lim &lt; l& gt; tile cat that likes fish [&lt; I adj &lt; l& gt; the I *cat-~ [that likes fish I adj &lt; l& gt; adj &lt; 2& gt; I that]~- l i k e s-~] fish Ilim &lt; l& gt; adj &lt; 2& gt; I There is exactly one sequence of words that is in agreement with all of the attribute-values in the tree.
