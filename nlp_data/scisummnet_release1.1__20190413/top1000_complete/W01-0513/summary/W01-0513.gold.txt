Is Knowledge-Free Induction Of Multiword Unit Dictionary Headwords A Solved Problem?
We seek a knowledge-free method for inducing multiword units from text corpora for use as machine-readable dictionary headwords.
We provide two major evaluations of nine existing collocation-finders and illustrate the continuing need for improvement.
We use Latent Semantic Analysis to make modest gains in performance, but we show the significant challenges encountered in trying this approach.
We show that WordNet is as effective an evaluation resource as the web for MWE detection methods, despite its inherent size limitations and static nature.
We compare the semantic vector of a phrase and the vectors of its component words in two ways: one includes the phrases's contexts in the construction of the semantic vectors of the parts and one does not.
