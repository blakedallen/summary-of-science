Using String-Kernels For Learning Semantic Parsers
We present a new approach for mapping natural language sentences to their formal meaning representations using string-kernel-based classifiers.
Our system learns these classifiers for every production in the formal language grammar. Meaning representations for novel natural language sentences are obtained by finding the most probable semantic parse using these string classifiers.
Our experiments on two real-world data sets show that this approach compares favorably to other existing systems and is particularly robust to noise.
We use word subsequence kernel to compute the similarity between two substrings.
Our model, KRISP, takes a discriminative approach where meaning representation structures are constructed from the natural language strings hierarchically.
KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing) (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a supervised learning system for semantic parsing which takes NL sentences paired with their MRs as training data.
