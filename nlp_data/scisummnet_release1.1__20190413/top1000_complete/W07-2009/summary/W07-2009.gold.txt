SemEval-2007 Task 10: English Lexical Substitution Task
In this paper we describe the English Lexical Substitution task for SemEval.
In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context.
The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context.
Participating systems are free to use any lexical resource.
There is a subtask which requires identifying cases where the word is functioning as part of a multiword in the sentence and detecting what that multiword is.
In the lexical substitution task, a system attempts to generate a word (or a set of words) to replace a target word, such that the meaning of the sentence is preserved.
We establish a benchmark for context-sensitive lexical similarity models.
