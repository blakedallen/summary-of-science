Automatic Rule Induction For Unknown-Word Guessing
Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to NLP modules that rely on morphosyntactic information, such as part-of-speech taggers or syntactic parsers.
In this paper we present a technique for fully automatic acquisition of rules that guess possible part-of-speech tags for unknown words using their starting and ending segments.
The learning is performed from a general-purpose lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus.
Three complimentary sets of word-guessing rules are statistically induced: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules.
Using the proposed technique, unknown-word-guessing rule sets were induced and integrated into a stochastic tagger and a rule-based tagger, which were then applied to texts with unknown words.
Our model, LTPOS, performs both sentence identification and POS tagging.
Our ltpos is a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence boundary disambiguation module.
