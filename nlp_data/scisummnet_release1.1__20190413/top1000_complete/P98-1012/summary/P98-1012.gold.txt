Entity-Based Cross-Document Core f erencing Using the Vector Space Model
Cross-document coreference occurs when the same person, place, event, or concept is discussed in more than one text source.
Computer recognition of this phenomenon is important because it helps break "the document boundary" by allowing a user to examine information about a particular entity from multiple text sources at the same time.
In this paper we describe a cross-document coreference resolution algorithm which uses the Vector Space Model to resolve ambiguities between people having the same name.
In addition, we also describe a scoring algorithm for evaluating the cross-document coreference chains produced by our system and we compare our algorithm to the scoring algorithm used in the MUC-6 (within document) coreference task.


We proposed entity-based cross-document co-referencing which uses co-reference chains of each document to generate its summary and then use the summary rather than the whole article to select informative words to be the features of the document.
