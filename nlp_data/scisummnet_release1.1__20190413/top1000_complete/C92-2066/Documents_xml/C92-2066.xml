			<S sid="1" ssid="1">Although stochastic techniques applied to syntax mod- eling have recently regained popularity, current lazl- guage models uffer from obvious inherent inadequacies.</S>
			<S sid="2" ssid="2">Early proposals uch as Markov Models, N-gram mod- els (Pratt, 1942; Shannon, 1948; Shannon, 1951) and tlidden Markov Models were very quickly shown to be linguistically not appropriate for natural language (e.g. Chomsky (1964, pages 13-18)) since they are unable to capture long distance dependencies or to describe hier- archically the syntax of natural anguages.</S>
			<S sid="3" ssid="3">Stochastic context-free granunar (Booth, 1969) is a hierarchical model more appropriate for natural languages, however none of such proposals (Lari and Young, 1990; Jelinek, Lafferty, and Mercer, 1990) perform as well as the sim- pler Markov Models because of the difficulty of captur- ing lexical information.</S>

			<S sid="7" ssid="7">more than one context-free rule cannot be captured un- der the context-freeness a sumption.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">This leads to the difficulty of maintaining a standard hierarchical model while capturing lexieal dependencies.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">This fact prompted researchers in natural language processing to give up hierarchical language models in the favor of non-hierarchical statistical models over words (such as word N-grams models).</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Probably for lack of a better language model, it has also been ar- gued that the phenomena that such devices cannot cap- ture occur relatively infrequently.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">Such argumentation is linguistically not sound.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">Lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (LTAG) t com- bine hierarchical structures while being hxieany sensi- tive and are therefore more appropriate for statistical analysis of language.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">In fact, LTAGs are the simplest hierarchical formalism which can serve as the basis for lexicalizing context-free grammar (Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Sehabes, 1991).</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">LTAG is a tree-rewriting system that combines trees of large domain with adjoining and substitution.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">The trees found in a TAG take advantage of the available x- tended domain of locality by localizing syntactic depen- dencies (such as finer-gap, subject-verb, verb-objeet) and most semantic dependencies ( uch as predicate- argument relationship).</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">For example, the following trees can be found in a LTAG lexicon: S /k NP,L VIP VP A V NPI NP NP VP* ADV L I I I uts J~n p~nutJ hungrily Since the elementary trees of a LTAG are minimal syntactic and semantic units, distributional analysis of the combination of these elementary trees based on a training corpus will inform us about relevant statistical aspects of the language such as the classes of words appearing as arguments of a predicative lement, the distribution of the adverbs licensed by a specific verb, or the adjectives licensed by a specific noun.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">This kind of statistical analysis as independently sug- gested in (Resnik, 1991) can be made with LTAGs be- cause of their extended omain of locality but also be- cause of their lexiealized property.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">lWe attallnle familiarity throughout the paper with TAGs and its lexicallzed variant, See, for instance, (Joehl, 1987), (Schabes, Abeill~, and Joehi, 1988), (Schabes, 1990) or (Joslfi and Schabes, 1~1).</S>

			<S sid="21" ssid="21">OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 In this paper, this intuition is made formally precise by defining the notion of a stochastic lexicalized tree- adjoining rammar (SLTAG).</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">We present an algorithm for computing the probability of a sentence generated by a SLTAG, and finally we introduce an iterative algo- r ithm for estimathlg the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of text.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">This algorithm can either be used for refining the parameters of a SLTAG or for inferring a tree-adjoining grammar frmn a training cor- pus.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">We also report preliminary experiments with this algorithm.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">Due to the lack of space, in this paper tim algorithms are described succinctly without proofs of correctness and more attention is given to tile concepts and tech- niques used for SLTAG.</S>

			<S sid="26" ssid="1">hfformally speaking, SLTAGs are defined by assigning a probability to tile event that an elementary tree is combined (by adjunction or substitution) on a specific node of another elementary tree.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="2">These events of com- bination are the stochastic processes considered.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="3">Since SLTAG are defined on the basis of the deriva- tion and since TAG allows for a notion of derivation independent from the trees that are derived, a precise mathematical definition of the SLTAG derivation must be given.</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="4">For this purpose, we use stochastic linear in- dexed grammars (SLIG) to formally express SLTAGs derivations.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="5">Linear Indexed grammar (LIG) (Alto, 1968; Gazdar, 1985) is a rewriting system in which the non-terminal symbols are augmented with a stack, in addition to rewriting non-terminals, the rules of the grammar can have the effect of pushing or popping symbols on top of tile stacks that are associated with each non-terminal symbol.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="6">A specific rule is triggered by the non-termlnal on the left hand side of the rule and the top element of its associated stack.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="7">The productions of a LIG are restricted to copy the stack corresponding to tile non-terminal being rewrit- ten to at most one stack associated with a non-terminal symbol on tile right hand side of the production?</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="8">In tile following, \[..p\] refers to a possibly unbounded stack whose top element is p and whose remaining part is schematically written as '..'.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="9">\[$\] represents a stack whose only element is the bottom of the stack.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="10">While it is possible to define SLIGs in general, we define them for the particular case where the rules are binary branching and where tile left hand sides are always incomparable.</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="11">A stochastic linear indexed grammar, G, is denoted by (VN, VT, VI, S, Prod), where VN is a finite set of non- terminal symbols; VT is a finite set of terminal symbols; VI is a finite set of stack symbols; S E VN is the start symbol; Prod is a finite set of productions of the form: Xo\[$po\] --* a Xo\[..po\] --.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="12">x~\[..m\] x~\[$p~\] x0\[..po\] -~ Xl\[$pd x~\[-.p~\] Xo\[$Po\] --~ Xl\[$pl\] X2\[$p2\] where Xk E Vjv, a E VT and po ~.</S>

			<S sid="39" ssid="14">Prodsuch 2LIGs have been shown to be weakly eqtfivalent to "Ibee- Adjoining Graramars (V~jay-Shanker, 1987).</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="15">that tbe sum of the probabilities of all the rules that can be applied to any non-terminal nnotated with a stack is equal to one.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="16">More precisely if, VX E VN,Vp E VI: ~ p(xt..pl -~ A) = 1 A P(X \[..p\] --* A) should be interpreted as the probability that X\[..p\] is rewritten as A. A derivation starts from S associated with the empty stack (S\[$\]) and each level of the derivation must be validated by a production rule.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="17">The language of a SLIG is defined as follows: L = {w E VT~ \[ S\[$\]~w}.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="18">The probability of a derivation is defined as the prod- uct of tile probabilities of all individual rules involved (counting repetition) in the derivation, the derivation being validated by a correct configuration of the stack at each level.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="19">The probability of a sentence is then com- puted as the sum of the probabilities of all derivations of tile sentence.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="20">Following tile construction described in (Vijay- Shanker and Weir, 1991), given a LTAG, Glaa, we con- struct an equivalent LIG, G,ua.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="21">Tile constructed LIG generates tile same language as Gtag and each deriva- tion of Gtaa corresponds to a unique LIG derivation corresponds to a unique derivation in G,ua (and con- versely).</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="22">In addition, a probability is assigned to each production of the LIG.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="23">For simplicity of explanation and without loss of generality we assume that each node in an elementary tree in Gt,9 is either a leaf node (i.e. either a foot node or a non-empty terminal node) or binary branching, a The construction of the equivalent SLIG follows.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="24">The non-terminal symbols of Gstia are the two sym- bols 'top' (t) and 'bottom' (b), tile set of terminal sym- bols is the same as the one of Gta9, the set of stack symbols is the set of nodes (not node labels) found in the elementary trees of Gla~ augmented with the bot- tom of tile stack ($), and tile start symbol is ' top' (t).</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="25">For "all root nodes ~10 of an initial tree whose root is labeled by S, the following starting rules are added: t\[$\] ~ t\[$,t0\] (1) These rules state that a derivation must start from the top of the root node of some initial tree.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="26">P is the prob- ability that a derivation starts from the initial tree as- sociated with a lexical item and rooted by %.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="27">Then, for all node '/ in an elementary tree, the fol- lowing rules are generated.</S>

It corresponds to the probability of substituting the lexicalized initial tree whose root node is 71, say 6, at the node q of a lexicalized elementary tree, say a. 5 The SLIG constructed as above is well defined if the following equalities hold for all nodes ~l: P(t\[..~/\] ---* b\[..~/\]) + E P(t\[..~/\] --* t\[..q0~\] ) = 1 (9) P(t\[$~/\] ---* t\[$Ol\]) ---- 1 (10) E P(t\[$\] -~ t\[$O0\]) = 1 (11) 4Since the granmmr is lexicalized, both trees a and /3 are a~ sociated with lexical iter~s, mad the site node for adjtmction ~ correuponds to some syntactic modification.</S>

			<S sid="69" ssid="44">The algorithm is an extension of the CKY-type parser for tree-adjoining grammar (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).</S>

The system consisting of trees of the form ~' and c~ can be seen as a stochastic lexicalized conle~:t-free gram- mars since it generates exactly context-free languages while being lexically sensitive.</S>
			<S sid="121" ssid="96">In the following, due to the lack of space, we report only few experiments on grammar inference using these restricted forms of SLTAG and the reestimation algo- rithm given in Section 4.</S>
			<S sid="122" ssid="97">We compare the results of the TAG inside-outside algorithm with the results of the inside-outside algorithm for context-free grammars (Baker, 1979).</S>
			<S sid="123" ssid="98">These preliminary experiments suggest that SLTAG achieves faster convergence (and also to a better solu- tion) than stochastic ontext-free grmnmars.</S>

			<S sid="125" ssid="100">We consider first an artificial language.</S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="101">The train- ing corpus consists of 100 sentences in the language L = {a"b'~ln &gt; 0} randomly generated by a stochastic context-free grammar.</S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="102">The initial grammar consists of the trees ~' , fl~, c~ a and ab with random probability of adjoining and null adjoining.</S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="103">The inferred grammar models correctly the language L. Its rules of the form (I), (5) or (fi) with high prob- ability follow (any excluded rule of the same form has probability at least l0 -a3 times lower than the rules given below).</S>
			<S sid="129" ssid="104">The structural rules of the form (2), (3), (4) or (7) are not shown since their probability always remain 1.</S>

			<S sid="133" ssid="108">We also conducted a similar experiment with the inside-outside algorithm for context-free grammar (Baker, 1979), starting with all pc~sible Chomsky Nor- mal Form rules over 4 non-terminals and the set of ter- minal symbols {a,b} (72 rules).</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="109">The inferred grammar does not quite correctly model the language L. Fur- thermore, the algorithm does not converge as fast as in the case of SLTAG (See Figure 1).</S>

			<S sid="146" ssid="121">A novel statistical language model and fundamental - gorithms for this model have been presented.</S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="122">SLTAGs provide a stochastic model both hierarchi- cal and sensitive to lexical information.</S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="123">They combiae the advantages of purely |exical models such ms N-gram distributions or Ilidden Markov Models and the one of ifierarchical modes as stochastic ontext-free gram- mars without their inhercnt limitations.</S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="124">The parame- ters of a SLTAG correspond to the probability of com- bining two structures each one associated with a word and therefore capture linguistically relevant distribu- tions over words.</S>
			<S sid="150" ssid="125">An algorithm for computing the probability of a sen- tence generated by a SLTAG was presented as well as an iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of raw text.</S>
			<S sid="151" ssid="126">Simi- larly to its context-free counterpart, he reestimation algorithm can be extended to handle partially parsed corpora (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).</S>
			<S sid="152" ssid="127">Preliminary experiments with a context-free subset of SLTAG confirms that SLTAG enables faster conver- gence than stochastic ontext-free grammars (SCFG).</S>
			<S sid="153" ssid="128">This is the case since SCFG are unable to represent lexieal influences on distribution except by a statisti- cally and eomputationally impractical proliferation of nonterminal symbols, whereas SLTAG allows for a lexi- eally sensitive distributional mmlysis while maintaining a hierarchical structure.</S>
			<S sid="154" ssid="129">Furthermore, the techniques explained in this paper apply to other grammatical formalisms uch as combi- natory categorial grammars and modified head gram- mars since they have been proven to be equivalent to tree-adjoining grammars and linear indexed grmnmars (Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1991).</S>
			<S sid="155" ssid="130">Due to the lack of space, only few experiments with SLTAG were reported.</S>
			<S sid="156" ssid="131">A full version of tile paper will be available by tile time of the meeting and more exper- imental details will be reported uring the presentation of the paper.</S>
			<S sid="157" ssid="132">In collaboration with Aravind Joshi, Fernando Pereira and Stuart Slfieber, we are currently investigat- ing additional algorithnLs and applications for SLTAG, methods for lexical clustering and autonratic onstruc- tion of a SLTAG from a large training corpus.</S>
