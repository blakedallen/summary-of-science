Selectional Preference And Sense Disambiguation
The absence of training data is a real problem for corpus-based approaches to sense disambiguation, one that is unlikely to be solved soon.
Selectional preference is traditionally connected with sense ambiguity; this paper explores how a statistical model of selectional preference, requiring neither manual annotation of selection restrictions nor supervised training, can be used in sense disambiguation.
We define selectional preference as the amount of information a verb provides about its semantic argument classes.
We present a method to acquire a set of conceptual classes for word senses, employing selectional preferences, based on the idea that certain linguistic predicates constraint the semantic interpretation of underlying words into certain classes.
In determining selectional preferences, we use uniformly distributing observed frequencies for a given word across all its senses.
