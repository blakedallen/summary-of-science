A Syntax-Directed Translator With Extended Domain Of Locality
A syntax-directed translator first parses the source-language input into a parse tree, and then recursively converts the tree into a string in the target-language.
We model this conversion by an extended tree-to-string transducer that have multi-level trees on the source-side, which gives our system more expressive power and flexibility.
We also define a direct probability model and use a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm to search for the best derivation.
The model is then extended to the general log-linear frame work in order to rescore with other features like n-gram language models.
We devise a simple-yet-effective algorithm to generate non-duplicate k-best translations for n-gram rescoring.
Initial experimental results on English-to-Chinese translation are presented.
We study a TSG-based tree-to-string alignment model.
We define the Extended Tree-to-String Transducer.
