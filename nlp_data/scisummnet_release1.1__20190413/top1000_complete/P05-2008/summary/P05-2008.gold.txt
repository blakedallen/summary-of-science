Using Emoticons To Reduce Dependency In Machine Learning Techniques For Sentiment Classification
Sentiment Classification seeks to identify a piece of text according to its author's general feeling toward their subject, be it positive or negative.
Traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem with reasonable success, but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the training and test data with respect to topic.
This paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important, and presents preliminary experiments with training data labeled with emoticons, which has the potential of being independent of domain, topic and time.
In sentiment analysis research, we use emoticons in newsgroup articles to extract instances relevant for training polarity classifiers.
We find that when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state.
