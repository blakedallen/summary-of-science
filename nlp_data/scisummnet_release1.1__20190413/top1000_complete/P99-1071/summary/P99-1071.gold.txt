Information Fusion In The Context Of Multi-Document Summarization
We present a method to automatically generate a concise summary by identifying and synthesizing similar elements across related text from a set of multiple documents.
Our approach is unique in its usage of language generation to reformulate the wording of the summary.
We observe for that task of multi-document summarization of news articles that extraction may be inappropriate because it may produce summaries which are overly verbose or biased towards some sources.
