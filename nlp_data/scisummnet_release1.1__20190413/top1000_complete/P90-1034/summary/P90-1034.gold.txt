Noun Classification From Predicate-Argument Structures
A method of determining the similarity of nouns on the basis of a metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large text corpus is described.
The resulting quasi-semantic classification of nouns demonstrates the plausibility of the distributional hypothesis, and has potential application to a variety of tasks, including automatic indexing, resolving nominal compounds, and determining the scope of modification.
We make use of a mutual-information based metric to determine noun similarity.
We use thenotion of distributional similarity, i.e., two words with similar meanings will be used in similar contexts.
