A Probability Model To Improve Word Alignment
Word alignment plays a crucial role in statistical machine translation.
Word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source of translation-related knowledge.
We present a statistical model for computing the probability of an alignment given a sentence pair.
This model allows easy integration of context-specific features.
Our experiments show that this model can be an effective tool for improving an existing word alignment.
We propose a direct alignment formulation and argue that it would be straightforward to estimate the parameters given a supervised alignment corpus.
We use the phrasal cohesion of a dependency tree as a constraint on a beam search aligner.
