A Maximum Entropy Approach to Chinese Word Segmentation
We participated in the Second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff.
Specifically, we evaluated our Chinese word segmenter in the open track, on all four corpora, namely Academia Sinica (AS), City University of Hong Kong (CITYU), Microsoft Research (MSR), and Peking University (PKU).
Based on a maximum entropy approach, our word segmenter achieved the highest F measure for AS, CITYU, and PKU, and the second highest for MSR.
We found that the use of an external dictionary and additional training corpora of different segmentation standards helped to further improve segmentation accuracy.
We present a post processing method to enhance the unknown word segmentation.
We use templates representing numbers, dates, letters etc.
