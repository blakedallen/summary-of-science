Automatic Identification Of Non-Compositional Phrases
Non-compositional expressions present a special challenge to NLP applications.
We present a method for automatic identification of non-compositional expressions using their statistical properties in a text corpus.
Our method is based on the hypothesis that when a phrase is non-composition, its mutual information differs significantly from the mutual informations of phrases obtained by substituting one of the word in the phrase with a similar word.
We use LSA to distinguish between compositional and non compositional verb-particle constructions and noun noun compounds.
We define a decision criterion for non compositional phrases based on the change in the mutual information of a phrase when substituting one word for a similar one based on an automatically constructed thesaurus.
