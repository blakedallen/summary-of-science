Hedge Trimmer: A Parse-And-Trim Approach To Headline Generation
This paper presents Hedge Trimmer, a HEaDline GEneration system that creates a headline for a newspaper story using linguistically-motivated heuristics to guide the choice of a potential headline.
We present feasibility tests used to establish the validity of an approach that constructs a headline by selecting words in order from a story.
In addition, we describe experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our linguistically-motivated approach over a HMM-based model, using both human evaluation and automatic metrics for comparing the two approaches.
Our approach focuses on extracting one or two informative sentences from the document and performing linguistically-motivated transformations to them in order to reduce the summary length.
