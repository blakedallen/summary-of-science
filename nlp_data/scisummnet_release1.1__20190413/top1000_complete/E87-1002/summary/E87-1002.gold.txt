Nonconcatenative Finite-State Morphology
Instead of modeling morphology along the more traditional finite-state transducer, we suggest modeling it with a n-tape automaton, where tapes would carry precisely this interleaving that is called for in Semitic interdigitation.
We propose a framework with which each of the auto segmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form.
