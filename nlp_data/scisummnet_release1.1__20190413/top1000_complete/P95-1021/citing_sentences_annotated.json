There are close connections to dependency formalisms: in particular in this operation we see a lexical dependency between the modifier word there and the head word is. It is possible to define syntactic language models, similar to (Charniak, 2001), which associate probabilities with these dependencies, roughly speaking of the form P (w m, s m |w h, s h ,pos,?), where w m and s m are the identities of the modifier word and spine, w h and s h are the identities of the head word and spine ,pos is the position in the head spine that is being adjoined into, and? is some additional state (e.g., state that tracks previous modifiers that have adjoined into the same spine)",
