Measuring The Semantic Similarity Of Texts
This paper presents a knowledge-based method for measuring the semantic-similarity of texts.
While there is a large body of previous work focused on finding the semantic similarity of concepts and words, the application of these word-oriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored.
In this paper, we introduce a method that combines word-to-word similarity metrics into a text-to-text metric, and we show that this method outperforms the traditional text similarity metrics based on lexical matching.
we proposed a hybrid method by combining six existing knowledge-based methods.
