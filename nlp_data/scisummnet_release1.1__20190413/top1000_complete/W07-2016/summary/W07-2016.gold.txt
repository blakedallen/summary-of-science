SemEval-2007 Task-17: English Lexical Sample SRL and All Words
This paper describes our experience in preparing the data and evaluating the results for three subtasks of SemEval-2007 Task-17 - Lexical Sample, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and All-Words respectively.
We tabulate and analyze the results of participating systems.
The use of coarse-grained sense groups (Palmer et al, 2007) has led to considerable advances in WSD performance, with accuracies of around 90%.
