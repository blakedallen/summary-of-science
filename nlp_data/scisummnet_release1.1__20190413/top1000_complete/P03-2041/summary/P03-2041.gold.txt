Learning Non-Isomorphic Tree Mappings For Machine Translation
Often one may wish to learn a tree-to-tree mapping, training it on unaligned pairs of trees, or on a mixture of trees and strings.
Unlike previous statistical formalisms (limited to isomorphic trees), synchronous TSG allows local distortion of the tree topology.
We reformulate it to permit dependency trees, and sketch EM/Viterbi algorithms for alignment, training, and decoding.
We argue that if the parse tree of source sentence is provided, decoding (for tree-to-string and tree-to-tree models) can also be cast as a tree-parsing problem.
We consider synchronous tree substitution grammar, a formalism that can account for structural mismatches, and is trained discriminatively.
