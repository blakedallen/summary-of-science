A Linear Programming Formulation For Global Inference In Natural Language Tasks
Given a collection of discrete random variables representing outcomes of learned local predictors in natural language, e.g., named entities and relations, we seek an optimal global assignment to the variables in the presence of general (non-sequential) constraints.
Examples of these constraints include the type of arguments a relation can take, and the mutual activity of different relations, etc.
We develop a linear programming formulation for this problem and evaluate it in the context of simultaneously learning named entities and relations.
Our approach allows us to efficiently incorporate domain and task specific constraints at decision time, resulting in significant improvements in the accuracy and the human-like quality of the inferences.
we use ILP to deal with the joint inference problem of named entity and relation identification.
we applied an ILP model to the task of the simultaneous assignment of semantic roles to the entities mentioned in a sentence and recognition of the relations holding between them.
we described a classification-based framework in which they jointly learn to identify named entities and relations.
