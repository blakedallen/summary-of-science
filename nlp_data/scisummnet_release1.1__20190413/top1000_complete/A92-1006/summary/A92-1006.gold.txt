Applied Text Generation
We divide tasks in the generation process into three stages: the text planner has access only to information about communicative goals, the discourse context, and semantics, and generates a non-linguistic representation of text structure and content. The sentence planner chooses abstract linguistic resources. It passes an abstract lexico-syntactic specification5 to the Realizer, which inflects, adds function words, and linearizes, thus producing the surface string.
