An Empirically Based System For Processing Definite Descriptions
We present an implemented system for processing definite descriptions in arbitrary domains.
The design of the system is based on the results of a corpus analysis previously reported, which highlighted the prevalence of discourse-new descriptions in newspaper corpora.
The annotated corpus was used to extensively evaluate the proposed techniques for matching definite descriptions with their antecedents, discourse segmentation, recognizing discourse-new descriptions, and suggesting anchors for bridging descriptions.
A major obstacle in the resolution of definite noun phrases with full lexical heads is that only a small proportion of them is actually anaphoric (ca. 30%).
In our system, WordNet is consulted to obtain the synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy relations for resolving the definite anaphora.
We classify each definite description as either direct anaphora, discourse-new, or bridging description.
We distinguish restrictive from non-restrictive post modification by ommitting modifiers that occur between commas, which should not be classified as chain starting.
For the discourse-new classification task, the model's most important feature is whether the head word of the NP to be classified has occurred previously.
