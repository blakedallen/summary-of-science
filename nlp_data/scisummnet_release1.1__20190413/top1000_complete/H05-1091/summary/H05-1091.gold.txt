A Shortest Path Dependency Kernel For Relation Extraction
We present a novel approach to relation extraction, based on the observation that the information required to assert a relationship between two named entities in the same sentence is typically captured by the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency graph.
Experiments on extracting top-level relations from the ACE (Automated Content Extraction) newspaper corpus show that the new shortest path dependency kernel outperforms a recent approach based on dependency tree kernels.
This work on relation extraction shows that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the in formation required to assert a relationship between them.
