Learning Multilingual Subjective Language via Cross-Lingual Projections
This paper explores methods for generating subjectivity analysis resources in a new language by leveraging on the tools and resources available in English.
Given a bridge between English and the selected target language (e.g., a bilingual dictionary or a parallel corpus), the methods can be used to rapidly create tools for subjectivity analysis in the new language.
We discuss different shortcomings of lexicon-based translation scheme for the more semantic-oriented task subjective analysis. Instead, we proposed to use a parallel-corpus, apply the classifier in the source language and use the corresponding sentences in the target language to train a new classifier.
We use a bilingual lexicon and a manually translated parallel corpus to generate a sentence classifier according to their level of subjectivity for Romanian.
