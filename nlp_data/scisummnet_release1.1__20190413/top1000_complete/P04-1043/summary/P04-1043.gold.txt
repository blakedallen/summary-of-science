A Study On Convolution Kernels For Shallow Statistic Parsing
In this paper we have designed and experimented novel convolution kernels for automatic classification of predicate arguments.
Their main property is the ability to process structured representations.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs), using a combination of such kernels and the flat feature kernel, classify PropBank predicate arguments with accuracy higher than the current argument classification state-of-the-art.
Additionally, experiments on FrameNet data have shown that SVMs are appealing for the classification of semantic roles even if the proposed kernels do not produce any improvement.
We can label semantic roles by classifying the smallest subtree that includes the predicate with one of its arguments, i.e. the so called PAF structure.
Our convolution kernel is characterized by two aspects: the semantic space of the subcategorization structures and the kernel function that measure their similarities.
