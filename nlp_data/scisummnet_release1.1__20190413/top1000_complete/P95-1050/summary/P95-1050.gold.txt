Identifying Word Translations In Non-Parallel Texts
Common algorithms for sentence and word-alignment allow the automatic identification of word translations from parallel texts.
This study suggests that the identification of word translations should also be possible with non-parallel and even unrelated texts.
The method proposed is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word co-occurrences in texts of different languages.
We propose a computationally demanding matrix purmutation method which maximizes a similarity between co-occurence matrices in two languages.
An underlying assumption in our work is that translations of words that are related in one language are also related in the other language.
