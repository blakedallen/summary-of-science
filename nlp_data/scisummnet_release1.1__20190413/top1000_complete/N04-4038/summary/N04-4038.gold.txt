Automatic Tagging Of Arabic Text: From Raw Text To Base Phrase Chunks
To date, there are no fully automated systems addressing the community's need for fundamental language processing tools for Arabic text.
In this paper, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach to automatically tokenize (segmenting off clitics), part-of- speech (POS) tag and annotate base phrases (BPs) in Arabic text.
We adapt highly accurate tools that have been developed for English text and apply them to Arabic text.
Khoja (2001) first introduced a tagger for Arabic, which has 131 tags, but this work has collapsed the tag set to simplify tagging.
We describe a part-of-speech tagger based on support vector machines that is trained on tokenized data (clitics are separate tokens), reporting a tagging accuracy of 95.5%.
