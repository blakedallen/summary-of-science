Development And Use Of A Gold-Standard Data Set For Subjectivity Classifications
This paper presents a case study of analyzing and improving intercoder reliability in discourse tagging using statistical techniques.
Biascorrected tags are formulated and successfully used to guide a revision of the coding manual and develop an automatic classifier.
We use a sentence-level Naive Bayes classifier using as features the presence or absence of particular syntactic classes (pronouns, adjectives, cardinal numbers, modal verbs, adverbs), punctuation and sentence position.
We define a subjective sentences as sentences expressing evaluations, opinions, emotions and speculations.
