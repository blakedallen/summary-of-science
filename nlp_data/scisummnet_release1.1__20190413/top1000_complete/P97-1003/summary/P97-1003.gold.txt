Three Generative Lexicalized Models For Statistical Parsing
In this paper we first propose a new statistical parsing model, which is a generative model of lexicalised context-free grammar.
We then extend the model to include a probabilistic treatment of both subcategorisation and wh-movement.
Results on Wall Street Journal text show that the parser performs at 88.1/87.5% constituent precision/recall, an average improvement of 2.3% over (Collins 96).
We provide a 29-million word parsed corpus from the Wall Street Journal.
