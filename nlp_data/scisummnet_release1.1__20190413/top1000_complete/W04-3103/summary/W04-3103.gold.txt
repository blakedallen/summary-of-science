The Language Of Bioscience: Facts Speculations And Statements In Between
We explore the use of speculative language in MEDLINE abstracts.
Results from a manual annotation experiment suggest that the notion of speculative sentence can be reliably annotated by humans.
In addition, an experiment with automated methods also suggest that reliable automated methods might also be developed.
Distributional observations are also presented as well as a discussion of possible uses for a system that can recognize speculative language.
we focus on introducing the problem, exploring annotation issues and outlining potential applications rather than on the specificities of the ML approach, and present some results using a manually crafted substring matching classifier and a supervised SVM on a collection of Medline abstracts.
we explore issues with annotating speculative language in biomedicine and outline potential applications.
we present a study on annotating hedges in biomedical documents.
