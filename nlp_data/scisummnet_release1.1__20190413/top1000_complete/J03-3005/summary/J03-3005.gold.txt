Using The Web To Obtain Frequencies For Unseen Bigrams
This article shows that the Web can be employed to obtain frequencies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus.
We describe a method for retrieving counts for adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams from the Web by querying a search engine.
We evaluate this method by demonstrating: (a) a high correlation between Web frequencies and corpus frequencies; (b) a reliable correlation between Web frequencies and plausibility judgments; (c) a reliable correlation between Web frequencies and frequencies recreated using class-based smoothing; (d) a good performance of Web frequencies in a pseudodisambiguation task.
Our study reveals that the large amount of data available for the web counts could outweigh the noisy problems.
