To meet this condition, we perform both the experiments and the uniformity measure calculation on a controlled subset of the data, with the condition that both the number of verbs and the number of sentences are the same for each frame. Following the methodology in Keller and Lapata (2003), we divide the verbs into four frequency bands, frequency being absolute number of annotated sentences: low (5), medium-low (12), medium-high (22), and high (38)",
