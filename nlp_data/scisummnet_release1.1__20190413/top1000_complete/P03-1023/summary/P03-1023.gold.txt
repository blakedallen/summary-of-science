Coreference Resolution Using Competition Learning Approach
In this paper we propose a competition learning approach to coreference resolution.
Traditionally, supervised machine learning approaches adopt the single-candidate model.
Nevertheless the preference relationship between the antecedent candidates cannot be determined accurately in this model.
By contrast, our approach adopts a twin-candidate learning model.
Such a model can present the competition criterion for antecedent candidates reliably, and ensure that the most preferred candidate is selected.
Furthermore, our approach applies a candidate filter to reduce the computational cost and data noises during training and resolution.
The experimental results on MUC-6 and MUC-7 data set show that our approach can outperform those based on the single-candidate model.
We make use of non-anaphors to create a special class of training instances in the twin-candidate model (Yang et al 2003) and improve the performance by 2.9 and 1.6 to 67.3 and 67.2 in F1-measure on the MUC-6 and MUC-7corpora, respectively.
