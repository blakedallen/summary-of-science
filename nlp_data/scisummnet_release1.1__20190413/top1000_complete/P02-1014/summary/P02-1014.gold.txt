Improving Machine Learning Approaches To Coreference Resolution
We present a noun phrase coreference system that extends the work of Soon et al. (2001) and, to our knowledge, produces the best results to date on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference resolution data sets - F-measures of 70.4 and 63.4, respectively.
Improvements arise from two sources: extra-linguistic changes to the learning framework and a large-scale expansion of the feature set to include more sophisticated linguistic knowledge.
In the testing phase, we used the best-first clustering.
We expand the feature set of Soon et al (2001) from 12 to 53 features.
We propose a rule-induction system with rule pruning.
