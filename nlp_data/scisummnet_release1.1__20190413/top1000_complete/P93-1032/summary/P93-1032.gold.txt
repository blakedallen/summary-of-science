Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora
This paper presents a new method for producing a dictionary of subcategorization frames from unlabelled text corpora.
It is shown that statistical filtering of the results of a finite state parser running on the output of a stochastic tagger produces high quality results, despite the error rates of the tagger and the parser.
Further, it is argued that this method can be used to learn all subcategorization frames, whereas previous methods are not extensible to a general solution to the problem.
We used the 4 million word corpus of the New York Times and selected only clauses with auxiliary verbs followed by automatically analyzing them with a finite-state parser.
