Text-Translation Alignment
We present an algorithm for aligning texts with their translations that is based only on internal evidence.
The relaxation process rests on a notion of which word in one text corresponds to which word in the other text that is essentially based on the similarity of their distributions.
It exploits a partial alignment of the word level to induce a maximum likelihood alignment of the sentence level, which is in turn used, in the next iteration, to refine the word level estimate.
The algorithm appears to converge to the correct sentence alignment in only a few iterations.
Our morphology algorithm is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms.
