Structural Ambiguity And Lexical Relations
We propose that ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with noun and verb, estimated on the basis of word distribution in a large corpus.
This work suggests that a distributional approach can be effective in resolving parsing problems that apparently call for complex reasoning.
We find that human arbiters constitently reach a higher agreement in propositional phrase attachment when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned.
