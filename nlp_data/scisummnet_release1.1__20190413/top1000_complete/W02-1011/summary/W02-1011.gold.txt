Thumbs Up? Sentiment Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques
We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative.
Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques deflnitively outperform human-produced baselines.
However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classiflcation, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classiflcation as on traditional topic-based categorization.
We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classiflcation problem more challenging.
We collect reviews form a movie database and rate them as positive, negative or neutral based on the training given by the reviewer.
We suggest that term-based models perform better than the frequency-based alternatives.
