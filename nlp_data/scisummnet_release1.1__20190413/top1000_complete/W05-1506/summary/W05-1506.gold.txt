Better K-Best Parsing
We discuss the relevance of k-best parsing to recent applications in natural language processing, and develop efficient algorithms for k-best trees in the framework of hypergraph parsing.
To demonstrate the efficiency, scal- ability and accuracy of these algorithms, we present experiments on Bikel’s implementation of Collins’ lexicalized PCFG model, and on Chiang’s CFG-based decoder for hierarchical phrase-based translation.
We show in particular how the improved output of our algorithms has the potential to improve results from parse reranking systems and other applications.
