Combining Distributional And Morphological Information For Part Of Speech Induction
In this paper we discuss algorithms for clustering words into classes from unlabelled text using unsupervised algorithms, based on distributional and morphological information.
We show how the use of morphological information can improve the performance on rare words, and that this is robust across a wide range of languages.
We propose a perplexity based test for the quality of the POS induction algorithm.
We find that many-to-1 accuracy has several defects.
