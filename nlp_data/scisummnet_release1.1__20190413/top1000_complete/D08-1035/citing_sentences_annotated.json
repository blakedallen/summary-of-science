All of these papers consider only linear topic segmentation; we introduce multi-scale lexical cohesion, which posits that the distribution of some words changes slowly with high-level topics, while others change rapidly with lower-level subtopics. This gives a principled mechanism to model hierarchical topic segmentation",
