An Algebra For Semantic Construction In Constraint-Based Grammars
We develop a framework for formalizing semantic construction within grammars expressed in typed feature structure logics, including HPSG.
The approach provides an alternative to the lambda calculus; it maintains much of the desirable flexibility of unification- based approaches to composition, while constraining the allowable operations in order to capture basic generalizations and improve maintainability.
The semantic interpretations are expressed using Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS), which provides the means to represent interpretations with a flat, underspecified semantics using terms of the predicate calculus and generalized quantifiers.
An MRS consists of a bag of labeled elementary predicates and their arguments, a list of scoping constraints, and a pair of relations that provide a hook into the representation - a label, which must outscope all the handles, and an index.
