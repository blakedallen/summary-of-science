Learning Bilingual Lexicons from Monolingual Corpora
We present a method for learning bilingual translation lexicons from monolingual corpora.
Word types in each language are characterized by purely monolingual features, such as context counts and orthographic substrings.
Translations are induced using a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis, which explains the monolingual lexicons in terms of latent matchings.
We show that high-precision lexicons can be learned in a variety of language pairs and from a range of corpus types.
We only use a small-sized bilingual lexicon containing 100 word pairs as seed lexicon.
The availability of parsers is a more stringent constraint, but our results suggest that more basic NLP methods may be sufficient for bilingual lexicon extraction. In this work, we have used a set of seed translations (unlike e.g., Haghighi et al (2008)).
We present a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis, in which monolingual features such as the context and orthographic substrings of words were taken into account.
