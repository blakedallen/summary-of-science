Memory-Based Dependency Parsing
This paper reports the results of experiments using memory-based learning to guide a deterministic dependency parser for unrestricted natural language text.
Using data from a small treebank of Swedish, memory-based classifiers for predicting the next action of the parser are constructed.
The accuracy of a classifier as such is evaluated on held-out data derived from the treebank, and its performance as a parser guide is evaluated by parsing the held-out portion of the treebank.
The evaluation shows that memory-based learning gives a signficant improvement over a previous probabilistic model based on maximum conditional likelihood estimation and that the inclusion of lexical features improves the accuracy even further.
