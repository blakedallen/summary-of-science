  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="6" ssid="1">This paper presents the results for the shared translation task of the 2007 ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="2">The goals of this paper are twofold: First, we evaluate the shared task entries in order to determine which systems produce translations with the highest quality.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="3">Second, we analyze the evaluation measures themselves in order to try to determine &#8220;best practices&#8221; when evaluating machine translation research.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="4">Previous ACL Workshops on Machine Translation were more limited in scope (Koehn and Monz, 2005; Koehn and Monz, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="5">The 2005 workshop evaluated translation quality only in terms of Bleu score.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="6">The 2006 workshop additionally included a limited manual evaluation in the style of NIST machine translation evaluation workshop.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="7">Here we apply eleven different automatic evaluation metrics, and conduct three different types of manual evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="8">Beyond examining the quality of translations produced by various systems, we were interested in examining the following questions about evaluation methodologies: How consistent are people when they judge translation quality?</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="9">To what extent do they agree with other annotators?</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="10">Can we improve human evaluation?</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="11">Which automatic evaluation metrics correlate most strongly with human judgments of translation quality?</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="12">This paper is organized as follows: inter-annotator agreement figures for the manual evaluation, and correlation numbers for the automatic metrics.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="13">2 Shared task overview there are over 30 million words of training data per language from the Europarl corpus and 1 million words from the News Commentary corpus.</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="14">Figure 1 provides some statistics about the corpora used this year.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="15">This year&#8217;s shared task changed in some aspects from last year&#8217;s: Similar to the IWSLT International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (Eck and Hori, 2005; Paul, 2006), and the NIST Machine Translation Evaluation Workshop (Lee, 2006) we provide the shared task participants with a common set of training and test data for all language pairs.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="16">The major part of data comes from current and upcoming full releases of the Europarl data set (Koehn, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="17">The data used in this year&#8217;s shared task was similar to the data used in last year&#8217;s shared task.</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="18">This year&#8217;s data included training and development sets for the News Commentary data, which was the surprise outof-domain test set last year.</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="19">The majority of the training data for the Spanish, French, and German tasks was drawn from a new version of the Europarl multilingual corpus.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="20">Additional training data was taken from the News Commentary corpus.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="21">Czech language resources were drawn from the News Commentary data.</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="22">Additional resources for Czech came from the CzEng Parallel Corpus (Bojar and &#711;Zabokrtsk&#180;y, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="23">Overall, To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition, we provided a complete baseline MT system, along with data resources.</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="24">To summarize, we provided: The performance of this baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year&#8217;s shared task.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="25">The test data was again drawn from a segment of the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the training data.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="26">Participants were also provided with three sets of parallel text to be used for system development and tuning.</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="27">In addition to the Europarl test set, we also collected editorials from the Project Syndicate website1, which are published in all the five languages of the shared task.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="28">We aligned the texts at a sentence level across all five languages, resulting in 2,007 sentences per language.</S>
    <S sid="34" ssid="29">For statistics on this test set, refer to Figure 1.</S>
    <S sid="35" ssid="30">The News Commentary test set differs from the Europarl data in various ways.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="31">The text type are editorials instead of speech transcripts.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="32">The domain is general politics, economics and science.</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="33">However, it is also mostly political content (even if not focused on the internal workings of the European Union) and opinion.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="34">We received submissions from 15 groups from 14 institutions, as listed in Table 1.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="35">This is a slight increase over last year&#8217;s shared task where submissions were received from 14 groups from 11 institutions.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="36">Of the 11 groups that participated in last year&#8217;s shared task, 6 groups returned this year.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="37">This year, most of these groups follow a phrasebased statistical approach to machine translation.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="38">However, several groups submitted results from systems that followed a hybrid approach.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="39">While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="40">The creation of parallel corpora such as the Europarl, the CzEng, and the News Commentary corpora should help in this direction by providing freely available language resources for building systems.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="41">The creation of an open source baseline system should also go a long way towards achieving this goal.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="42">For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.</S>

  <SECTION title="3 Human evaluation" number="2">
    <S sid="48" ssid="1">We evaluated the shared task submissions using both manual evaluation and automatic metrics.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="2">While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine translation systems, they are an imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="3">Manual evaluation is time consuming and expensive to perform, so comprehensive comparisons of multiple systems are rare.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="4">For our manual evaluation we distributed the workload across a number of people, including participants in the shared task, interested volunteers, and a small number of paid annotators.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="5">More than 100 people participated in the manual evaluation, with 75 of those people putting in at least an hour&#8217;s worth of effort.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="6">A total of 330 hours of labor was invested, nearly doubling last year&#8217;s all-volunteer effort which yielded 180 hours of effort.</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="7">Beyond simply ranking the shared task submissions, we had a number of scientific goals for the manual evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="8">Firstly, we wanted to collect data which could be used to assess how well automatic metrics correlate with human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="9">Secondly, we wanted to examine different types of manual evaluation and assess which was the best.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="10">A number of criteria could be adopted for choosing among different types of manual evaluation: the ease with which people are able to perform the task, their agreement with other annotators, their reliability when asked to repeat judgments, or the number of judgments which can be collected in a fixed time period.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="11">There are a range of possibilities for how human evaluation of machine translation can be done.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="12">For instance, it can be evaluated with reading comprehension tests (Jones et al., 2005), or by assigning subjective scores to the translations of individual sentences (LDC, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="13">We examined three different ways of manually evaluating machine translation quality: The most widely used methodology when manually evaluating MT is to assign values from two five point scales representing fluency and adequacy.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="14">These scales were developed for the annual NIST Machine Translation Evaluation Workshop by the Linguistics Data Consortium (LDC, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="15">The five point scale for adequacy indicates how much of the meaning expressed in the reference translation is also expressed in a hypothesis translation: The second five point scale indicates how fluent the translation is.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="16">When translating into English the values correspond to: Separate scales for fluency and adequacy were developed under the assumption that a translation might be disfluent but contain all the information from the source.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="17">However, in principle it seems that people have a hard time separating these two aspects of translation.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="18">The high correlation between people&#8217;s fluency and adequacy scores (given in Tables 17 and 18) indicate that the distinction might be false.</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="19">Figure 2: In constituent-based evaluation, the source sentence was parsed, and automatically aligned with the reference translation and systems&#8217; translations Another problem with the scores is that there are no clear guidelines on how to assign values to translations.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="20">No instructions are given to evaluators in terms of how to quantify meaning, or how many grammatical errors (or what sort) separates the different levels of fluency.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="21">Because of this many judges either develop their own rules of thumb, or use the scales as relative rather than absolute.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="22">These are borne out in our analysis of inter-annotator agreement in Section 6.</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="23">Because fluency and adequacy were seemingly difficult things for judges to agree on, and because many people from last year&#8217;s workshop seemed to be using them as a way of ranking translations, we decided to try a separate evaluation where people were simply asked to rank translations.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="24">The instructions for this task were: Rank each whole sentence translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="25">These instructions were just as minimal as for fluency and adequacy, but the task was considerably simplified.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="26">Rather than having to assign each translation a value along an arbitrary scale, people simply had to compare different translations of a single sentence and rank them.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="27">In addition to having judges rank the translations of whole sentences, we also conducted a pilot study of a new type of evaluation methodology, which we call constituent-based evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="28">In our constituent-based evaluation we parsed the source language sentence, selected constituents from the tree, and had people judge the translations of those syntactic phrases.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="29">In order to draw judges&#8217; attention to these regions, we highlighted the selected source phrases and the corresponding phrases in the translations.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="30">The corresponding phrases in the translations were located via automatic word alignments.</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="31">Figure 2 illustrates the constituent based evaluation when applied to a German source sentence.</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="32">The German source sentence is parsed, and various phrases are selected for evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="80" ssid="33">Word alignments are created between the source sentence and the reference translation (shown), and the source sentence and each of the system translations (not shown).</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="34">We parsed the test sentences for each of the languages aside from Czech.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="35">We used Cowan and Collins (2005)&#8217;s parser for Spanish, Arun and Keller (2005)&#8217;s for French, Dubey (2005)&#8217;s for German, and Bikel (2002)&#8217;s for English.</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="36">The word alignments were created with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus containing 200,000 sentence pairs of the training data, plus sets of 4,007 sentence pairs created by pairing the test sentences with the reference translations, and the test sentences paired with each of the system translations.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="37">The phrases in the translations were located using techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation which extract phrase pairs from word alignments (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="38">Because the word-alignments were created automatically, and because the phrase extraction is heuristic, the phrases that were selected may not exactly correspond to the translations of the selected source phrase.</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="39">We noted this in the instructions to judges: Rank each constituent translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="40">Grade only the highlighted part of each translation.</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="41">Please note that segments are selected automatically, and they should be taken as an approximate guide.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="42">They might include extra words that are not in the actual alignment, or miss words on either end.</S>
    <S sid="90" ssid="43">The criteria that we used to select which constituents were to be evaluated were: The final criterion helped reduce the number of alignment errors.</S>
    <S sid="91" ssid="44">We collected judgments using a web-based tool.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="45">Shared task participants were each asked to judge 200 sets of sentences.</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="46">The sets consisted of 5 system outputs, as shown in Figure 3.</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="47">The judges were presented with batches of each type of evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="48">We presented them with five screens of adequacy/fluency scores, five screens of sentence rankings, and ten screens of constituent rankings.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="49">The order of the types of evaluation were randomized.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="50">In order to measure intra-annotator agreement 10% of the items were repeated and evaluated twice by each judge.</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="51">In order to measure inter-annotator agreement 40% of the items were randomly drawn from a common pool that was shared across all Judges were allowed to select whichever data set they wanted, and to evaluate translations into whatever languages they were proficient in.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="52">Shared task participants were excluded from judging their own systems.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="53">Table 2 gives a summary of the number of judgments that we collected for translations of individual sentences.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="54">Since we had 14 translation tasks and four different types of scores, there were 55 different conditions.2 In total we collected over 81,000 judgments.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="55">Despite the large number of conditions we managed to collect more than 1,000 judgments for most of them.</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="56">This provides a rich source of data for analyzing the quality of translations produced by different systems, the different types of human evaluation, and the correlation of automatic metrics with human judgments.3 2We did not perform a constituent-based evaluation for Czech to English because we did not have a syntactic parser for Czech.</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="57">We considered adapting our method to use Bojar (2004)&#8217;s dependency parser for Czech, but did not have the time.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="4 Automatic evaluation" number="3">
    <S sid="105" ssid="1">The past two ACL workshops on machine translation used Bleu as the sole automatic measure of translation quality.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="2">Bleu was used exclusively since it is the most widely used metric in the field and has been shown to correlate with human judgments of translation quality in many instances (Doddington, 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Przybocki, 2004).</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="3">However, recent work suggests that Bleu&#8217;s correlation with human judgments may not be as strong as previously thought (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="4">The results of last year&#8217;s workshop further suggested that Bleu systematically underestimated the quality of rule-based machine translation systems (Koehn and Monz, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="5">We used the manual evaluation data as a means of testing the correlation of a range of automatic metrics in addition to Bleu.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="6">In total we used eleven different automatic evaluation measures to rank the shared task submissions.</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="7">They are: against a reference.</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="8">It flexibly matches words using stemming and WordNet synonyms.</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="9">Its flexible matching was extended to French, Spanish, German and Czech for this workshop (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="10">4The GTM scores presented here are an F-measure with a weight of 0.1, which counts recall at 10x the level of precision.</S>
    <S sid="115" ssid="11">The exponent is set at 1.2, which puts a mild preference towards items with words in the correct order.</S>
    <S sid="116" ssid="12">These parameters could be optimized empirically for better results.</S>
    <S sid="117" ssid="13">TER calculates the number of edits required to change a hypothesis translation into a reference translation.</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="14">The possible edits in TER include insertion, deletion, and substitution of single words, and an edit which moves sequences of contiguous words.</S>
    <S sid="119" ssid="15">The scores produced by these are given in the tables at the end of the paper, and described in Section 5.</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="16">We measured the correlation of the automatic evaluation metrics with the different types of human judgments on 12 data conditions, and report these in Section 6.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="5 Shared task results" number="4">
    <S sid="121" ssid="1">The results of the human evaluation are given in Tables 9, 10, 11 and 12.</S>
    <S sid="122" ssid="2">Each of those tables present four scores: There was reasonably strong agreement between these four measures at which of the entries was the best in each data condition.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="3">There was complete 5Since different annotators can vary widely in how they assign fluency and adequacy scores, we normalized these scores on a per-judge basis using the method suggested by Blatz et al. (2003) in Chapter 5, page 97. agreement between them in 5 of the 14 conditions, and agreement between at least three of them in 10 of the 14 cases.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="4">Table 3 gives a summary of how often different participants&#8217; entries were ranked #1 by any of the four human evaluation measures.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="5">SYSTRAN&#8217;s entries were ranked the best most often, followed by University of Edinburgh, University of Catalonia and LIMSI-CNRS.</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="6">The following systems were the best performing for the different language pairs: SYSTRAN was ranked the highest in German-English, University of Catalonia was ranked the highest in Spanish-English, LIMSI-CNRS was ranked highest in French-English, and the University of Maryland and a commercial system were the highest for agreement for the different types of manual evaluation Czech-English.</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="7">While we consider the human evaluation to be primary, it is also interesting to see how the entries were ranked by the various automatic evaluation metrics.</S>
    <S sid="128" ssid="8">The complete set of results for the automatic evaluation are presented in Tables 13, 14, 15, and 16.</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="9">An aggregate summary is provided in Table 4.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="10">The automatic evaluation metrics strongly favor the University of Edinburgh, which garners 41% of the top-ranked entries (which is partially due to the fact it was entered in every language pair).</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="11">Significantly, the automatic metrics disprefer SYSTRAN, which was strongly favored in the human evaluation.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="6 Meta-evaluation" number="5">
    <S sid="132" ssid="1">In addition to evaluating the translation quality of the shared task entries, we also performed a &#8220;metaevaluation&#8221; of our evaluation methodologies.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="2">We measured pairwise agreement among annotators using the kappa coefficient (K) which is widely used in computational linguistics for measuring agreement in category judgments (Carletta, 1996).</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="3">It is defined as where P(A) is the proportion of times that the annotators agree, and P(E) is the proportion of time that they would agree by chance.</S>
    <S sid="135" ssid="4">We define chance agreement for fluency and adequacy as 5, since they are based on five point scales, and for ranking as s since there are three possible out comes when ranking the output of a pair of systems: A &gt; B, A = B, A &lt; B.</S>
    <S sid="136" ssid="5">For inter-annotator agreement we calculated P(A) for fluency and adequacy by examining all items that were annotated by two or more annotators, and calculating the proportion of time they assigned identical scores to the same items.</S>
    <S sid="137" ssid="6">For the ranking tasks we calculated P(A) by examining all pairs of systems which had been judged by two or more judges, and calculated the proportion of time that they agreed that A &gt; B, A = B, or A &lt; B.</S>
    <S sid="138" ssid="7">For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, but gathered items that were annotated on multiple occasions by a single annotator.</S>
    <S sid="139" ssid="8">Table 5 gives K values for inter-annotator agreement, and Table 6 gives K values for intra-annoator agreement.</S>
    <S sid="140" ssid="9">These give an indication of how often different judges agree, and how often single judges are consistent for repeated judgments, respectively.</S>
    <S sid="141" ssid="10">The interpretation of Kappa varies, but according to Landis and Koch (1977) 0 &#8722; &#8722;.2 is slight, .21&#8722; &#8722;.4 is fair, .41&#8722;&#8722;.6 is moderate, .61&#8722;&#8722;.8 is substantial and the rest almost perfect.</S>
    <S sid="142" ssid="11">The K values for fluency and adequacy should give us pause about using these metrics in the future.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="12">When we analyzed them as they are intended to be&#8212;scores classifying the translations of sentences into different types&#8212;the inter-annotator agreement was barely considered fair, and the intra-annotator agreement was only moderate.</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="13">Even when we reassessed fluency and adequacy as relative ranks the agreements increased only minimally.</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="14">The agreement on the other two types of manual evaluation that we introduced were considerably better.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="15">The both the sentence and constituent ranking had moderate inter-annotator agreement and substantial intra-annotator agreement.</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="16">Because the constituent ranking examined the translations of short phrases, often times all systems produced the same translations.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="17">Since these trivially increased agreement (since they would always be equally ranked) we also evaluated the inter- and intra-annotator agreement when those items were excluded.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="18">The agreement remained very high for constituent-based evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="19">We used the web interface to collect timing information.</S>
    <S sid="151" ssid="20">The server recorded the time when a set of sentences was given to a judge and the time when the judge returned the sentences.</S>
    <S sid="152" ssid="21">We divided the time that it took to do a set by the number of sentences in the set.</S>
    <S sid="153" ssid="22">The average amount of time that it took to assign fluency and adequacy to a single sentence was 26 seconds.6 The average amount of time it took to rank a sentence in a set was 20 seconds.</S>
    <S sid="154" ssid="23">The average amount of time it took to rank a highlighted constituent was 11 seconds.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="24">Figure 4 shows the distribution of times for these tasks.</S>
    <S sid="156" ssid="25">6Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from these calculations, because there was a strong chance that annotators were interrupted while completing the task.</S>
    <S sid="157" ssid="26">These timing figures are promising because they indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the most reliable on (constituent ranking and sentence ranking) were also much quicker to complete than the ones that they were unreliable on (assigning fluency and adequacy scores).</S>
    <S sid="158" ssid="27">This suggests that fluency and adequacy should be replaced with ranking tasks in future evaluation exercises.</S>
    <S sid="159" ssid="28">To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics with the human judgments of translation quality we used Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient p. We opted for Spearman rather than Pearson because it makes fewer assumptions about the data.</S>
    <S sid="160" ssid="29">Importantly, it can be applied to ordinal data (such as the fluency and adequacy scales).</S>
    <S sid="161" ssid="30">Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient is equivalent to Pearson correlation on ranks.</S>
    <S sid="162" ssid="31">After the raw scores that were assigned to systems by an automatic metric and by one of our manual evaluation techniques have been converted to ranks, we can calculate p using the simplified equation: where di is the difference between the rank for systemi and n is the number of systems.</S>
    <S sid="163" ssid="32">The possible values of p range between 1(where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (where the systems are ranked in the reverse order).</S>
    <S sid="164" ssid="33">Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher value for p is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower p. Table 17 reports p for the metrics which were used to evaluate translations into English.7.</S>
    <S sid="165" ssid="34">Table 7 summarizes the results by averaging the correlation numbers by equally weighting each of the data conditions.</S>
    <S sid="166" ssid="35">The table ranks the automatic evaluation metrics based on how well they correlated with human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="167" ssid="36">While these are based on a relatively few number of items, and while we have not performed any tests to determine whether the differences in p are statistically significant, the results are nevertheless interesting, since three metrics have higher correlation than Bleu: Tables 18 and 8 report p for the six metrics which were used to evaluate translations into the other languages.</S>
    <S sid="168" ssid="37">Here we find that Bleu and TER are the closest to human judgments, but that overall the correlations are much lower than for translations into English.</S>

  <SECTION title="7 Conclusions" number="6">
    <S sid="169" ssid="1">Similar to last year&#8217;s workshop we carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance for translating from four European languages into English, and vice versa.</S>
    <S sid="170" ssid="2">This year we substantially increased the number of automatic evaluation metrics and were also able to nearly double the efforts of producing the human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="171" ssid="3">There were substantial differences in the results results of the human and automatic evaluations.</S>
    <S sid="172" ssid="4">We take the human judgments to be authoritative, and used them to evaluate the automatic metrics.</S>
    <S sid="173" ssid="5">We measured correlation using Spearman&#8217;s coefficient and found that three less frequently used metrics were stronger predictors of human judgments than Bleu.</S>
    <S sid="174" ssid="6">They were: semantic role overlap (newly introduced in this workshop) ParaEval-recall and Meteor.</S>
    <S sid="175" ssid="7">Although we do not claim that our observations are indisputably conclusive, they again indicate that the choice of automatic metric can have a significant impact on comparing systems.</S>
    <S sid="176" ssid="8">Understanding the exact causes of those differences still remains an important issue for future research.</S>
    <S sid="177" ssid="9">This year&#8217;s evaluation also measured the agreement between human assessors by computing the Kappa coefficient.</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="10">One striking observation is that inter-annotator agreement for fluency and adequacy can be called &#8216;fair&#8217; at best.</S>
    <S sid="179" ssid="11">On the other hand, comparing systems by ranking them manually (constituents or entire sentences), resulted in much higher inter-annotator agreement.</S>
