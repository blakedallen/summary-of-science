Knowledge-Free Induction Of Morphology Using Latent Semantic Analysis
Morphology induction is a subproblem of important tasks like automatic learning of machine-readable dictionaries and grammar induction.
Previous morphology induction approaches have relied solely on statistics of hypothesized stems and affixes to choose which affixes to consider legitimate.
Relying on stem-and-affix statistics rather than semantic knowledge leads to a number of problems, such as the inappropriate use of valid affixes ("ally" stemming to "all").
We introduce a semantic-based algorithm for learning morphology which only proposes affixes when the stem and stem-plus-affix are sufficiently similar semantically.
We implement our approach using Latent Semantic Analysis and show that our semantics-only approach provides morphology induction results that rival a current state-of-the-art system.
We generate a list of N candidate suffixes and use this list to identify word pairs which share the same stem.
We attempt to cluster morphologically related words starting with an unrefined trie search, which contains a parameter of minimum possible stem length and an upper bound on potential affix candidates, that is constrained by semantic similarity in a word context vector space.
