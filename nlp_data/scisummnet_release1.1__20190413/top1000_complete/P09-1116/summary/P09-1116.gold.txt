Phrase Clustering for Discriminative Learning
We present a simple and scalable algorithm for clustering tens of millions of phrases and use  the resulting clusters as features in  discriminative classifiers.
To demonstrate the power and generality of this approach, we apply the method in two very different applications: named entity recognition and query classification.
Our results show that phrase clusters offer significant improvements over word clusters.
Our NER system achieves the best current result on the widely used CoNLL benchmark.
Our query classifier is on par with the best system in KDDCUP 2005 without resorting to labor intensive knowledge engineering efforts.
We explore a two-stage cluster-based approach: first clustering phrases and then relying on a supervised learner to identify useful clusters and assign proper weights to cluster features.
We present a K-means-like non-hierarchical clustering algorithm for phrases, which uses MapReduce.
