A Simple Similarity-based Model for Selectional Preferences
We propose a new, simple model for the automatic induction of selectional preferences, using corpus-based semantic similarity metrics.
Focusing on the task of semantic role labeling, we compute selectional preferences for semantic roles.
In evaluations the similarity-based model shows lower error rates than both Resnik's WordNet-based model and the EM-based clustering model, but has coverage problems.
We extract the set of seen head words from corpora with semantic role annotation, and use only a single vector space representation.
We model the contexts of a word as the distribution of words that co-occur with it.
We select a subset of roles in FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998) to test and uses all labeled instances within this subset.
