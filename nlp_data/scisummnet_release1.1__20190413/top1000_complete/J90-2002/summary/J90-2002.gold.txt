A Statistical Approach To Machine Translation
In this paper, we present a statistical approach to machine translation.
We describe the application of our approach to translation from French to English and give preliminary results.
We estimate parameters for a model of word-to-word correspondences and word re-orderings directly from large corpora of parallel bilingual text.
