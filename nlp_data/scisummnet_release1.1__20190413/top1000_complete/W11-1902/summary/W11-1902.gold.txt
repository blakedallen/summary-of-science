Stanfordâ€™s Multi-Pass Sieve Coreference Resolution System at the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task
This paper details the coreference resolution system submitted by Stanford at the CoNLL2011 shared task.
Our system is a collection of deterministic coreference resolution models that incorporate lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse information.
All these models use global document-level information by sharing mention attributes, such as gender and number, across mentions in the same cluster.
We participated in both the open and closed tracks and submitted results using both predicted and gold mentions.
Our system was ranked first in both tracks, with a score of 57.8 in the closed track and 58.3 in the open track.
The Stanford coreference resolver, which won the CoNLL-2011 shared task on coreference resolution, adopts the once-popular rule-based approach, resolving pronouns simply with rules that encode the aforementioned traditional linguistic constraints on coreference, such as the Binding constraints and gender and number agreement. The infrequency of occurrences of difficult pronouns in these standard evaluation corpora by no means undermines their significance, however.
