Never Look Back: An Alternative to Centering
I propose a model for determining the hearer's attentional state which depends solely on a list of salient discourse entities (S-list).
The ordering among the elements of the S-list covers also the function of the backward-looking center in the centering model.
The ranking criteria for the S-list are based on the distinction between hearer-old and hearer-new discourse entities and incorporate preferences for inter- and intra-sentential anaphora.
The model is the basis for an algorithm which operates incrementally, word by word.
We argue that the information status of an antecedent is more important than the grammatical role in which it occurs.
We evaluate on hand-annotated data.
We restrict our algorithm to the current and last sentence.
