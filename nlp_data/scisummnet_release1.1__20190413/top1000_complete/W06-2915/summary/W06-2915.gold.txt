Which Side Are You On? Identifying Perspectives At The Document And Sentence Levels
In this paper we investigate a new problem of identifying the perspective from which a document is written.
By perspective we mean a point of view, for example, from the perspective of Democrats or Republicans.
Can computers learn to identify the perspective of a document?
Not every sentence is written strongly from a perspective.
Can computers learn to identify which sentences strongly convey a particular perspective?
We develop statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and sentence levels, and evaluate the proposed models on articles about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The results show that the proposed models successfully learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage and can identify the perspective of a document with high accuracy.
We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling for opinion modelling (Lin et al, 2006).
Our experiments were conducted in political debate corpus (Lin et al 2006).
We explore relationships between sentence-level and document-level classification for a stance-like prediction task.
We introduce implicit sentiment a topic of study in computational linguistics under the rubric of identifying perspective, though similar work had begun earlier in the realm of political science.
