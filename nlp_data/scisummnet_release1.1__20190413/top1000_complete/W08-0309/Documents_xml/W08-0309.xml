  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="5" ssid="1">This paper presents the results the shared tasks of the 2008 ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, which builds on two past workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007).</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="2">There were two shared tasks this year: a translation task which evaluated translation between 10 pairs of European languages, and an evaluation task which examines automatic evaluation metrics.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="3">There were a number of differences between this year&#8217;s workshop and last year&#8217;s workshop: newspaper articles from a number of different sources.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="4">This out-of-domain test set contrasts with the in-domain Europarl test set.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="5">&#8226; New language pairs &#8211; We evaluated the quality of Hungarian-English machine translation.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="6">Hungarian is a challenging language because it is agglutinative, has many cases and verb conjugations, and has freer word order.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="7">GermanSpanish was our first language pair that did not include English, but was not manually evaluated since it attracted minimal participation. of rule-based MT systems, and provided their output, which were also treated as fully fledged entries in the manual evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="8">Three additional groups were invited to apply their system combination algorithms to all systems. ation metrics with human judgments at the system level, we also measured how consistent they were with the human rankings of individual sentences.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="9">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the shared translation task, describing the test sets, the materials that were provided to participants, and a list of the groups who participated.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="10">Section 3 describes the manual evaluation of the translations, including information about the different types of judgments that were solicited and how much data was collected.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="11">Section 4 presents the results of the manual evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="12">Section 5 gives an overview of the shared evaluation task, describes which automatic metrics were submitted, and tells how they were evaluated.</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="13">Section 6 presents the results of the evaluation task.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="14">Section 7 validates the manual evaluation methodology.</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="15">2 Overview of the shared translation task The shared translation task consisted of 10 language pairs: English to German, German to English, English to Spanish, Spanish to English, English to French, French to English, English to Czech, Czech to English, Hungarian to English, and German to Spanish.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="16">Each language pair had two test sets drawn from the proceedings of the European parliament, or from newspaper articles.1 The test data for this year&#8217;s task differed from previous years&#8217; data.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="17">Instead of only reserving a portion of the training data as the test set, we hired people to translate news articles that were drawn from a variety of sources during November and December of 2007.</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="18">We refer to this as the News test set.</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="19">A total of 90 articles were selected, 15 each from a variety of Czech-, English-, French-, German-, Hungarianand Spanish-language news sites:2 Hungarian: Napi (3 documents), Index (2), Origo (5), N&#180;epszabads&#180;ag (2), HVG (2), Uniospez (1) The translations were created by the members of EuroMatrix consortium who hired a mix of professional and non-professional translators.</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="20">All translators were fluent or native speakers of both languages, and all translations were proofread by a native speaker of the target language.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="21">All of the translations were done directly, and not via an intermediate language.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="22">So for instance, each of the 15 Hungarian articles were translated into Czech, English, French, German and Spanish.</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="23">The total cost of creating the 6 test sets consisting of 2,051 sentences in each language was approximately 17,200 euros (around 26,500 dollars at current exchange rates, at slightly more than 10c/word).</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="24">Having a test set that is balanced in six different source languages and translated across six languages raises some interesting questions.</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="25">For instance, is it easier, when the machine translation system translates in the same direction as the human translator?</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="26">We found no conclusive evidence that shows this.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="27">What is striking, however, that the parts differ dramatically in difficulty, based on the original source language.</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="28">For instance the Edinburgh French-English system has a BLEU score of 26.8 on the part that was originally Spanish, but a score of on 9.7 on the part that was originally Hungarian.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="29">For average scores for each original language, see Table 1.</S>
    <S sid="34" ssid="30">In order to remain consistent with previous evaluations, we also created a Europarl test set.</S>
    <S sid="35" ssid="31">The Europarl test data was again drawn from the transcripts of EU parliamentary proceedings from the fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the Europarl training data.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="32">Our rationale behind investing a considerable sum to create the News test set was that we believe that it more accurately represents the quality of systems&#8217; translations than when we simply hold out a portion of the training data as the test set, as with the Europarl set.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="33">For instance, statistical systems are heavily optimized to their training data, and do not perform as well on out-of-domain data (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="34">Having both the News test set and the Europarl test set allows us to contrast the performance of systems on in-domain and out-of-domain data, and provides a fairer comparison between systems trained on the Europarl corpus and systems that were developed without it.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="35">To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to the field, we provided a complete baseline MT system, along with data resources.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="36">We provided: The performance of this baseline system is similar to the best submissions in last year&#8217;s shared task.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="37">The training materials are described in Figure 1.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="38">We received submissions from 23 groups from 18 institutions, as listed in Table 2.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="39">We also evaluated seven additional commercial rule-based MT systems, bringing the total to 30 systems.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="40">This is a significant increase over last year&#8217;s shared task, where there were submissions from 15 groups from 14 institutions.</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="41">Of the 15 groups that participated in last year&#8217;s shared task, 11 groups returned this year.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="42">One of the goals of the workshop was to attract submissions from newcomers to the field, and we are please to have attracted many smaller groups, some as small as a single graduate student and her adviser.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="43">The 30 submitted systems represent a broad range of approaches to statistical machine translation.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="44">These include statistical phrase-based and rulebased (RBMT) systems (which together made up the bulk of the entries), and also hybrid machine translation, and statistical tree-based systems.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="45">For most language pairs, we assembled a solid representation of the state of the art in machine translation.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="46">In addition to individual systems being entered, this year we also solicited a number of entries which combined the results of other systems.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="47">We invited researchers at BBN, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Edinburgh to apply their system combination algorithms to all of the systems submitted to shared translation task.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="48">We designated the translations of the Europarl set as the development data for combination techniques which weight each system.3 CMU combined the French-English systems, BBN combined the French-English and German-English systems, and Edinburgh submitted combinations for the French-English and GermanEnglish systems as well as a multi-source system combination which combined all systems which translated from any language pair into English for the News test set.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="49">The University of Saarland also produced a system combination over six commercial RBMT systems (Eisele et al., 2008).</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="50">Saarland graciously provided the output of these systems, which we manually evaluated alongside all other entries.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="51">For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system descriptions in the proceedings of the workshop.</S>

  <SECTION title="3 Human evaluation" number="2">
    <S sid="56" ssid="1">As with last year&#8217;s workshop, we placed greater emphasis on the human evaluation than on the automatic evaluation metric scores.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="2">It is our contention that automatic measures are an imperfect substitute for human assessment of translation quality.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="3">Therefore, rather than select an official automatic evaluation metric like the NIST Machine Translation Workshop does (Przybocki and Peterson, 2008), we define the manual evaluation to be primary, and use 3Since the performance of systems varied significantly between the Europarl and News test sets, such weighting might not be optimal.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="4">However this was a level playing field, since none of the individual systems had development data for the News set either.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="5">Europarl corpus and from the Project Syndicate, a web site which collects political commentary in multiple languages.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="6">For Czech and Hungarian we use other available parallel corpora.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="7">Note that the number of words is computed based on the provided tokenizer and that the number of distinct words is the based on lowercased tokens. the human judgments to validate automatic metrics.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="8">Manual evaluation is time consuming, and it requires a monumental effort to conduct it on the scale of our workshop.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="9">We distributed the workload across a number of people, including shared task participants, interested volunteers, and a small number of paid annotators.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="10">More than 100 people participated in the manual evaluation, with 75 people putting in more than an hour&#8217;s worth of effort, and 25 putting in more than four hours.</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="11">A collective total of 266 hours of labor was invested.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="12">We wanted to ensure that we were using our annotators&#8217; time effectively, so we carefully designed the manual evaluation process.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="13">In our analysis of last year&#8217;s manual evaluation we found that the NISTstyle fluency and adequacy scores (LDC, 2005) were overly time consuming and inconsistent.4 We therefore abandoned this method of evaluating the translations.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="14">We asked people to evaluate the systems&#8217; output in three different ways: The manual evaluation software asked for repeated judgments from the same individual, and had multiple people judge the same item, and logged the time it took to complete each judgment.</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="15">This allowed us to measure intra- and inter-annotator agreement, and to analyze the average amount of time it takes to collect the different kinds of judgments.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="16">Our analysis is presented in Section 7.</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="17">Ranking translations relative to each other is a relatively intuitive and straightforward task.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="18">We therefore kept the instructions simple.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="19">The instructions for this task were: 4It took 26 seconds on average to assign fluency and adequacy scores to a single sentence, and the inter-annotator agreement had a Kappa of between .225&#8211;.25, meaning that annotators assigned the same scores to identical sentences less than 40% of the time.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="20">Rank each whole sentence translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="21">Ranking several translations at a time is a variant of force choice judgments where a pair of systems is presented and an annotator is asked &#8220;Is A better than B, worse than B, or equal to B.&#8221; In our experiments, annotators were shown five translations at a time, except for the Hungarian and Czech language pairs where there were fewer than five system submissions.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="22">In most cases there were more than 5 systems submissions.</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="23">We did not attempt to get a complete ordering over the systems, and instead relied on random selection and a reasonably large sample size to make the comparisons fair.</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="24">We continued the constituent-based evaluation that we piloted last year, wherein we solicited judgments about the translations of short phrases within sentences rather than whole sentences.</S>
    <S sid="80" ssid="25">We parsed the source language sentence, selected syntactic constituents from the tree, and had people judge the translations of those syntactic phrases.</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="26">In order to draw judges&#8217; attention to these regions, we highlighted the selected source phrases and the corresponding phrases in the translations.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="27">The corresponding phrases in the translations were located via automatic word alignments.</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="28">Figure 2 illustrates how the source and reference phrases are highlighted via automatic word alignments.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="29">The same is done for sentence and each of the system translations.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="30">The English, French, German and Spanish test sets were automatically parsed using high quality parsers for those languages (Bikel, 2002; Arun and Keller, 2005; Dubey, 2005; Bick, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="31">The word alignments were created with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus containing the complete Europarl training data, plus sets of 4,051 sentence pairs created by pairing the test sentences with the reference translations, and the test sentences paired with each of the system translations.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="32">The phrases in the translations were located using standard phrase extraction techniques (Koehn et al., 2003).</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="33">Because the word-alignments were created automatically, and because the phrase extraction is heuristic, the phrases that were selected may not exactly correspond to the translations of the selected source phrase.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="34">We noted this in the instructions to judges: Rank each constituent translation from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are allowed).</S>
    <S sid="90" ssid="35">Grade only the highlighted part of each translation.</S>
    <S sid="91" ssid="36">Please note that segments are selected automatically, and they should be taken as an approximate guide.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="37">They might include extra words that are not in the actual alignment, or miss words on either end.</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="38">76 The criteria that we used to select which constituents to evaluate were: The final criterion helped reduce the number of alignment errors, but may have biased the sample to phrases that are more easily aligned.</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="39">This year we introduced a variant on the constituentbased evaluation, where instead of asking judges to rank the translations of phrases relative to each other, we asked them to indicate which phrasal translations were acceptable and which were not.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="40">Decide if the highlighted part of each translation is acceptable, given the reference.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="41">This should not be a relative judgment against the other system translations.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="42">The instructions also contained the same caveat about the automatic alignments as above.</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="43">For each phrase the judges could click on &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;, or &#8220;Not Sure.&#8221; The number of times people clicked on &#8220;Not Sure&#8221; varied by language pair and task.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="44">It was selected as few as 5% of the time for the EnglishSpanish News task to as many as 12.5% for the Czech-English News task.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="45">We collected judgments using a web-based tool that presented judges with batches of each type of evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="46">We presented them with five screens of sentence rankings, ten screens of constituent rankings, and ten screen of yes/no judgments.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="47">The order of the types of evaluation were randomized.</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="48">In order to measure intra-annotator agreement 10% of the items were repeated and evaluated twice by each judge.</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="49">In order to measure inter-annotator agreement 40% of the items were randomly drawn from a common pool that was shared across all annotators so that we would have items that were judged by multiple annotators.</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="50">Judges were allowed to select whichever data set they wanted, and to evaluate translations into whatever languages they were proficient in.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="51">Shared task participants were excluded from judging their own systems.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="52">In addition to evaluation each language pair individually, we also combined all system translations into English for the News test set, taking advantage of the fact that our test sets were parallel across all languages.</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="53">This allowed us to gather interesting data about the difficulty of translating from different languages into English.</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="54">Table 3 gives a summary of the number of judgments that we collected for translations of individual sentences.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="55">We evaluated 14 translation tasks with three different types of judgments for most of them, for a total of 46 different conditions.</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="56">In total we collected over 75,000 judgments.</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="57">Despite the large number of conditions we managed to collect between 1,000&#8211;2,000 judgments for the constituentbased evaluation, and several hundred to several thousand judgments for the sentence ranking tasks.</S>

    <S sid="113" ssid="1">Tables 4, 5, and 6 summarize the results of the human evaluation of the quality of the machine translation systems.</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="2">Table 4 gives the results for the manual evaluation which ranked the translations of sentences.</S>

    <S sid="119" ssid="7">Table 7 summaries the results for the All-English task that we introduced this year.</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="8">Appendix C gives an extremely detailed pairwise comparison between each of the systems, along with an indication of whether the differences are statistically significant.</S>
    <S sid="121" ssid="9">The highest ranking entry for the All-English task was the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s system combination entry.</S>
    <S sid="122" ssid="10">It uses a technique similar to Rosti et al. (2007) to perform system combination.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="11">Like the other system combination entrants, it was tuned on the Europarl test set and tested on the News test set, using systems that submitted entries to both tasks.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="12">The University of Edinburgh&#8217;s system combination went beyond other approaches by combining output from multiple languages pairs (FrenchEnglish, German-English and Spanish-English), resulting in 37 component systems.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="13">Rather than weighting individual systems, it incorporated weighted features that indicated which language the system was originally translating from.</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="14">This entry was part of ongoing research in multi-lingual, multisource translation.</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="15">Since there was no official multilingual system combination track, this entry should be viewed only as a contrastive data point.</S>
    <S sid="128" ssid="16">We analyzed the All-English judgments to see which source languages were preferred more often, thinking that this might be a good indication of how challenging it is for current MT systems to translate from each of the languages into English.</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="17">For this analysis we collapsed all of the entries derived from one source language into an equivalence class, and judged them against the others.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="18">Therefore, all French systems were judged against all German systems, and so on.</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="19">We found that French systems were judged to be better than or equal to other systems 69% of the time, Spanish systems 64% of the time, German systems 47% of the time, Czech systems 39% of the time, and Hungarian systems 29% of the time.</S>
    <S sid="132" ssid="20">We performed a similar analysis by collapsing the RBMT systems into one equivalence class, and the other systems into another.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="21">We evaluated how well these two classes did on the sentence ranking task for each language pair and test set, and found that RBMT was a surprisingly good approach in many of the conditions.</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="22">RBMT generally did better on the News test set and for translations into German, suggesting that SMT&#8217;s forte is in test sets where it has appropriate tuning data and for language pairs with less reordering than between German and English. system was judged to be better than or equal to all other systems in the sentence ranking task for the All-English condition.</S>

  <SECTION title="5 Shared evaluation task overview" number="4">
    <S sid="136" ssid="1">The manual evaluation data provides a rich source of information beyond simply analyzing the quality of translations produced by different systems.</S>
    <S sid="137" ssid="2">In particular, it is especially useful for validating the automatic metrics which are frequently used by the machine translation research community.</S>
    <S sid="138" ssid="3">We continued the shared task which we debuted last year, by examining how well various automatic metrics correlate with human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="139" ssid="4">In addition to examining how well the automatic evaluation metrics predict human judgments at the system-level, this year we have also started to measure their ability to predict sentence-level judgments.</S>
    <S sid="140" ssid="5">The automatic metrics that were evaluated in this year&#8217;s shared task were the following: some of the allowable variation in translation.</S>
    <S sid="141" ssid="6">We use a single reference translation in our experiments. words.</S>
    <S sid="142" ssid="7">They calculate Bleu (posbleu) and F-measure (pos4gramFmeasure) by matching part of speech 4grams in a hypothesis translation against the reference translation.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="8">In addition to the above metrics, which scored the translations on both the system-level5 and the sentence-level, there were a number of metrics which focused on the sentence-level: system translations (svm-rank).</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="9">Features included in Duh (2008)&#8217;s training were sentencelevel BLEU scores and intra-set ranks computed from the entire set of translations.</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="10">&#8226; USaar&#8217;s evaluation metric (alignment-prob) uses Giza++ to align outputs of multiple systems with the corresponding reference translations, with a bias towards identical one-to-one alignments through a suitably augmented corpus.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="11">The Model4 log probabilities in both directions are added and normalized to a scale between 0 and 1.</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="12">To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics with the human judgments of translation quality at the system-level we used Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient p. We converted the raw scores assigned each system into ranks.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="13">We assigned a ranking to the systems for each of the three types of manual evaluation based on: &#8226; The percent of time that the sentences it produced were judged to be better than or equal to the translations of any other system.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="14">&#8226; The percent of time that its constituent translations were judged to be better than or equal to the translations of any other system.</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="15">&#8226; The percent of time that its constituent translations were judged to be acceptable.</S>
    <S sid="151" ssid="16">We calculated p three times for each automatic metric, comparing it to each type of human evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="152" ssid="17">Since there were no ties p can be calculated using the simplified equation: where di is the difference between the rank for systemi and n is the number of systems.</S>
    <S sid="153" ssid="18">The possible values of p range between 1(where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (where the systems are ranked in the reverse order).</S>
    <S sid="154" ssid="19">Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher value for p is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower p. Measuring sentence-level correlation under our human evaluation framework was made complicated by the fact that we abandoned the fluency and adequacy judgments which are intended to be absolute scales.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="20">Some previous work has focused on developing automatic metrics which predict human ranking at the sentence-level (Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007a; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b).</S>
    <S sid="156" ssid="21">Such work generally used the 5-point fluency and adequacy scales to combine the translations of all sentences into a single ranked list.</S>
    <S sid="157" ssid="22">This list could be compared against the scores assigned by automatic metrics and used to calculate correlation coefficients.</S>
    <S sid="158" ssid="23">We did not gather any absolute scores and thus cannot compare translations across different sentences.</S>
    <S sid="159" ssid="24">Given the seemingly unreliable fluency and adequacy assignments that people make even for translations of the same sentences, it may be dubious to assume that their scoring will be reliable across sentences.</S>
    <S sid="160" ssid="25">The data points that we have available consist of a set of 6,400 human judgments each ranking the output of 5 systems.</S>
    <S sid="161" ssid="26">It&#8217;s straightforward to construct a ranking of each of those 5 systems using the scores automatic evaluation metrics on translations into French, German and Spanish assigned to their translations of that sentence by the automatic evaluation metrics.</S>
    <S sid="162" ssid="27">When the automatic scores have been retrieved, we have 6,400 pairs of ranked lists containing 5 items.</S>
    <S sid="163" ssid="28">How best to treat these is an open discussion, and certainly warrants further thought.</S>
    <S sid="164" ssid="29">It does not seem like a good idea to calculate p for each pair of ranked list, because 5 items is an insufficient number to get a reliable correlation coefficient and its unclear if averaging over all 6,400 lists would make sense.</S>
    <S sid="165" ssid="30">Furthermore, many of the human judgments of 5 contained ties, further complicating matters.</S>
    <S sid="166" ssid="31">Therefore rather than calculating a correlation coefficient at the sentence-level we instead ascertained how consistent the automatic metrics were with the human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="167" ssid="32">The way that we calculated consistency was the following: for every pairwise comparison of two systems on a single sentence by a person, we counted the automatic metric as being consistent if the relative scores were the same (i.e. the metric assigned a higher score to the higher ranked system).</S>
    <S sid="168" ssid="33">We divided this by the total number of pairwise comparisons to get a percentage.</S>
    <S sid="169" ssid="34">Because the systems generally assign real numbers as scores, we excluded pairs that the human annotators ranked as ties.</S>

    <S sid="170" ssid="1">Tables 8 and 9 report the system-level p for each automatic evaluation metric, averaged over all translations directions into English and out of English6 For the into English direction the Meteor score with its parameters tuned on adequacy judgments had the strongest correlation with ranking the translations of whole sentences.</S>
    <S sid="171" ssid="2">It was tied with the combined method of Gimenez and Marquez (2008) for the highest correlation over all three types of human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="172" ssid="3">Bleu was the second to lowest ranked overall, though this may have been due in part to the fact that we were using test sets which had only a single reference translation, since the cost of creating multiple references was prohibitively expensive (see Section 2.1).</S>
    <S sid="173" ssid="4">In the reverse direction, for translations out of English into the other languages, Bleu does considerably better, placing second overall after the part-ofspeech variant on it proposed by Popovic and Ney (2007).</S>
    <S sid="174" ssid="5">Yet another variant of Bleu which utilizes Meteor&#8217;s flexible matching has the strongest correlation for sentence-level ranking.</S>

    <S sid="177" ssid="8">Tables 10 and 11 report the consistency of the automatic evaluation metrics with human judgments on a sentence-by-sentence basis, rather than on the system level.</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="9">For the translations into English the ULC metric (which itself combines many other metrics) had the strongest correlation with human judgments, correctly predicting the human ranking of a each pair of system translations of a sentence more than half the time.</S>
    <S sid="179" ssid="10">This is dramatically higher than the chance baseline, which is not .5, since it must correctly rank a list of systems rather than a pair.</S>
    <S sid="180" ssid="11">For the reverse direction meteor-ranking performs very strongly.</S>
    <S sid="181" ssid="12">The svn-rank which had the lowest overall correlation at the system level does the best at consistently predicting the translations of syntactic constituents into other languages.</S>

  <SECTION title="7 Validation and analysis of the manual evaluation" number="6">
    <S sid="182" ssid="1">In addition to scoring the shared task entries, we also continued on our campaign for improving the process of manual evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="183" ssid="2">We measured pairwise agreement among annotators using the kappa coefficient (K) which is widely used in computational linguistics for measuring agreement in category judgments (Carletta, 1996).</S>
    <S sid="184" ssid="3">It is defined as annotator agreement for the different types of manual evaluation where P(A) is the proportion of times that the annotators agree, and P(E) is the proportion of time that they would agree by chance.</S>
    <S sid="185" ssid="4">We define chance agreement for ranking tasks as s since there are three possible outcomes when ranking the output of a pair of systems: A &gt; B, A = B, A &lt; B, and for the Yes/No judgments as 2 since we ignored those items marked &#8220;Not Sure&#8221;.</S>
    <S sid="186" ssid="5">For inter-annotator agreement we calculated P(A) for the yes/no judgments by examining all items that were annotated by two or more annotators, and calculating the proportion of time they assigned identical scores to the same items.</S>
    <S sid="187" ssid="6">For the ranking tasks we calculated P(A) by examining all pairs of systems which had been judged by two or more judges, and calculated the proportion of time that they agreed that A &gt; B, A = B, or A &lt; B.</S>
    <S sid="188" ssid="7">For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, but gathered items that were annotated on multiple occasions by a single annotator.</S>
    <S sid="189" ssid="8">Table 12 gives K values for inter-annotator agreement, and Table 13 gives K values for intraannotator agreement.</S>
    <S sid="190" ssid="9">These give an indication of how often different judges agree, and how often single judges are consistent for repeated judgments, re</S>

    <S sid="192" ssid="2">The interpretation of Kappa varies, but according to Landis and Koch (1977), 0&#8722;.2 is slight, .2 &#8722;.4 is fair, .4 &#8722;.6 is moderate, .6 &#8722;.8 is substantial and the rest almost perfect.</S>
    <S sid="193" ssid="3">The inter-annotator agreement for the sentence ranking task was fair, for the constituent ranking it was moderate and for the yes/no judgments it was substantial.7 For the intraannotator agreement K indicated that people had moderate consistency with their previous judgments on the sentence ranking task, substantial consistency with their previous constituent ranking judgments, and nearly perfect consistency with their previous yes/no judgments.</S>
    <S sid="194" ssid="4">These K values indicate that people are able to more reliably make simple yes/no judgments about the translations of short phrases than they are to rank phrases or whole sentences.</S>
    <S sid="195" ssid="5">While this is an interesting observation, we do not recommend doing away with the sentence ranking judgments.</S>
    <S sid="196" ssid="6">The higher agreement on the constituent-based evaluation may be influenced based on the selection criteria for which phrases were selected for evaluation (see Section 3.2).</S>
    <S sid="197" ssid="7">Additionally, the judgments of the short phrases are not a great substitute for sentence-level rankings, at least in the way we collected them.</S>
    <S sid="198" ssid="8">The average correlation coefficient between the constituent-based judgments with the sentence ranking judgments is only p = 0.51.</S>
    <S sid="199" ssid="9">Tables 19 and 20 give a detailed break down of the correlation of the different types of human judgments with each other on each translation task.</S>
    <S sid="200" ssid="10">It may be possible to select phrases in such a way that the constituent-based evaluations are a better substitute for the sentence-based ranking, for instance by selecting more of constituents from each sentence, or attempting to cover most of the words in each sentence in a phrase-by-phrase manner.</S>
    <S sid="201" ssid="11">This warrants further investigation.</S>
    <S sid="202" ssid="12">It might also be worthwhile to refine the instructions given to annotators about how to rank the translations of sentences to try to improve their agreement, which is currently lower than we would like it to be (although it is substantially better than the previous fluency and adequacy scores, 7Note that for the constituent-based evaluations we verified that the high K was not trivially due to identical phrasal translations.</S>
    <S sid="203" ssid="13">We excluded screens where all five phrasal translations presented to the annotator were identical, and report both numbers. which had a K &lt; .25 in last year&#8217;s evaluation).</S>
    <S sid="204" ssid="14">We used the web interface to collect timing information.</S>
    <S sid="205" ssid="15">The server recorded the time when a set of sentences was given to a judge and the time when the judge returned the sentences.</S>
    <S sid="206" ssid="16">It took annotators an average of 18 seconds per sentence to rank a list of sentences.8 It took an average of 10 seconds per sentence for them to rank constituents, and an average of 8.5 seconds per sentence for them to make yes/no judgments.</S>
    <S sid="207" ssid="17">Figure 3 shows the distribution of times for these tasks.</S>
    <S sid="208" ssid="18">These timing figures indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the most reliable on (yes/no judgments and constituent ranking) were also much quicker to complete than the ones they were less reliable on (ranking sentences).</S>
    <S sid="209" ssid="19">Given that they are faster at judging short phrases, they can do proportionally more of them.</S>
    <S sid="210" ssid="20">For instance, we could collect 211 yes/no judgments in the same amount of time that it would take us to collect 100 sentence ranking judgments.</S>
    <S sid="211" ssid="21">However, this is partially offset by the fact that many of the translations of shorter phrases are identical, which means that we have to collect more judgments in order to distinguish between two systems.</S>
    <S sid="212" ssid="22">8Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from these calculations, because there was a strong chance that annotators were interrupted while completing the task.</S>
    <S sid="213" ssid="23">One strong advantage of the yes/no judgments over the ranking judgments is their potential for reuse.</S>
    <S sid="214" ssid="24">We have invested hundreds of hours worth of effort evaluating the output of the translation systems submitted to this year&#8217;s workshop and last year&#8217;s workshop.</S>
    <S sid="215" ssid="25">While the judgments that we collected provide a wealth of information for developing automatic evaluation metrics, we cannot not re-use them to evaluate our translation systems after we update their parameters or change their behavior in anyway.</S>
    <S sid="216" ssid="26">The reason for this is that altered systems will produce different translations than the ones that we have judged, so our relative rankings of sentences will no longer be applicable.</S>
    <S sid="217" ssid="27">However, the translations of short phrases are more likely to be repeated than the translations of whole sentences.</S>
    <S sid="218" ssid="28">Therefore if we collect a large number of yes/no judgments for short phrases, we could build up a database that contains information about what fragmentary translations are acceptable for each sentence in our test corpus.</S>
    <S sid="219" ssid="29">When we change our system and want to evaluate it, we do not need to manually evaluate those segments that match against the database, and could instead have people evaluate only those phrasal translations which are new.</S>
    <S sid="220" ssid="30">Accumulating these judgments over time would give a very reliable idea of what alternative translations were allowable.</S>
    <S sid="221" ssid="31">This would be useful because it could alleviate the problems associated with Bleu failing to recognize allowable variation in translation when multiple reference translations are not available (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).</S>
    <S sid="222" ssid="32">A large database of human judgments might also be useful as an objective function for minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) or in other system development tasks.</S>

  <SECTION title="8 Conclusions" number="8">
    <S sid="223" ssid="1">Similar to previous editions of this workshop we carried out an extensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation performance for translating from European languages into English, and vice versa.</S>
    <S sid="224" ssid="2">One important aspect in which this year&#8217;s shared task differed from previous years was the introduction of an additional newswire test set that was different in nature to the training data.</S>
    <S sid="225" ssid="3">We also added new language pairs to our evaluation: Hungarian-English and German-Spanish.</S>
    <S sid="226" ssid="4">As in previous years we were pleased to notice an increase in the number of participants.</S>
    <S sid="227" ssid="5">This year we received submissions from 23 groups from 18 institutions.</S>
    <S sid="228" ssid="6">In addition, we evaluated seven commercial rule-based MT systems.</S>
    <S sid="229" ssid="7">The goal of this shared-task is two-fold: First we want to compare state-of-the-art machine translation systems, and secondly we aim to measure to what extent different evaluation metrics can be used to assess MT quality.</S>
    <S sid="230" ssid="8">With respect to MT quality we noticed that the introduction of test sets from a different domain did have an impact on the ranking of systems.</S>
    <S sid="231" ssid="9">We observed that rule-based systems generally did better on the News test set.</S>
    <S sid="232" ssid="10">Overall, it cannot be concluded that one approach clearly outperforms other approaches, as systems performed differently on the various translation tasks.</S>
    <S sid="233" ssid="11">One general observation is that for the tasks where statistical combination approaches participated, they tended to score relatively high, in particular with respect to Bleu.</S>
    <S sid="234" ssid="12">With respect to measuring the correlation between automated evaluation metrics and human judgments we found that using Meteor and ULCh (which utilizes a variety of metrics, including Meteor) resulted in the highest Spearman correlation scores on average, when translating into English.</S>
    <S sid="235" ssid="13">When translating from English into French, German, and Spanish, Bleu and posbleu resulted in the highest correlations with human judgments.</S>
    <S sid="236" ssid="14">Finally, we investigated inter- and intra-annotator agreement of human judgments using Kappa coefficients.</S>
    <S sid="237" ssid="15">We noticed that ranking whole sentences results in relatively low Kappa coefficients, meaning that there is only fair agreement between the assessors.</S>
    <S sid="238" ssid="16">Constituent ranking and acceptability judgments on the other hand show moderate and substantial inter-annotator agreement, respectively.</S>
    <S sid="239" ssid="17">Intraannotator agreement was substantial to almost perfect, except for the sentence ranking assessment where agreement was only moderate.</S>
    <S sid="240" ssid="18">Although it is difficult to draw exact conclusions from this, one might wonder whether the sentence ranking task is simply too complex, involving too many aspects according to which translations can be ranked.</S>
    <S sid="241" ssid="19">The huge wealth of the data generated by this workshop, including the human judgments, system translations and automatic scores, is available at http://www.statmt.org/wmt08/ for other researchers to analyze.</S>
