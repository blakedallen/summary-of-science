Building A Discourse-Tagged Corpus In The Framework Of Rhetorical Structure Theory
We describe our experience in developing a discourse-annotated corpus for community-wide use.
Working in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory, we were able to create a large annotated resource with very high consistency, using a well-defined methodology and protocol.
This resource is made publicly available through the Linguistic Data Consortium to enable researchers to develop empirically grounded, discourse-specific applications.
In our Discourse Tree Bank only 26% of Contrast relations are indicated by cue phrases while in NTC-7 about 70% of Contrast were indicated by cue phrases.
Our corpus contains 385 Wall Street Journal articles annotated following the Rhetorical Structure Theory.
