The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure
The Penn Treebank has recently implemented a new syntactic annotation scheme, designed to highlight aspects of predicate-argument structure.
This paper discusses the implementation of crucial aspects of this new annotation scheme.
It incorporates a more consistent treatment of a wide range of grammatical phenomena, provides a set of coindexed null elements in what can be thought of as "underlying" position for phenomena such as wh-movement, passive, and the subjects of infinitival constructions, provides some non-context free annotational mechanism to allow the structure of discontinuous constituents to be easily recovered, and allows for a clear, concise tagging system for some semantic roles.
Our Switchboard corpus contains transcriptions of spoken, spontaneous conversation annotated with phrase-structure trees.
The PennTreebank II marks subjects (SBJ), logical objects of passives (LGS), some reduced relative clauses (RRC), as well as other grammatical information, but does not mark each constituent with a grammatical role.
