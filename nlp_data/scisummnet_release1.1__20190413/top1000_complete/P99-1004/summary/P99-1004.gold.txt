Measures Of Distributional Similarity
We study distributional similarity measures for the purpose of improving probability estimation for unseen cooccurrences.
We use verb-object relations in both active and passive voice constructions.
We find that our asymmetric skew divergence, a generalisation of Kullback-Leibler divergence, persorms best for improving probability estimates for unseen word co-occurrences.
