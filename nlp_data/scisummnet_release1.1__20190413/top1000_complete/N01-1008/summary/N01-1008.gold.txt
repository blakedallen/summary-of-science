Text And Knowledge Mining For Coreference Resolution
Traditionally coreference is resolved by satisfying a combination of salience, syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints.
The acquisition of such knowledge is time-consuming, difficult and error-prone.
Therefore, we present a knowledge minimalist methodology of mining coreference rules from annotated text corpora.
Semantic consistency evidence, which is a form of knowledge required by coreference, is easily retrieved from WordNet.
Additional consistency knowledge is discovered by a meta-bootstrapping algorithm applied to unlabeled texts.
We use paths through Wordnet, using not only synonym and is-a relations, but also parts, morphological derivations, gloss texts and polysemy, which are weighted with a measure based on the relation types and number of path elements.
The path patterns in WordNet are utilized to compute the semantic consistency between NPs.
