Verb Semantics And Lexical Selection
This paper will focus on the semantic representation of verbs in computer systems and its impact on lexical selection problems in machine translation (MT).
Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection must be based on interpretation of the sentence as well as selection restrictions placed on the verb arguments.
A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT.
We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches (KBMT), and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems.
Examples and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can achieve correct lexical selection.
We design our mesure such that shallow nodes are less similar than nodes that are deeper in the WordNet hierarchy.
Our mesure is purely taxonomic; it does not require any corpus statistics.
Our similarity metric measures the depth of the two concepts in the WordNet taxonomy and the depth of the least common subsumer and then combines these figures into a similarity score.
