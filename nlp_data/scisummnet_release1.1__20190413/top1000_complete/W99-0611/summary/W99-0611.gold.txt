Noun Phrase Coreference As Clustering
This paper introduces a new, unsupervised algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution.
It differs from existing methods in that it views coreference resolution as a clustering task.
In an evaluation on the MUC-6 coreference resolution corpus, the algorithm achieves an F-measure of 53.6%, placing it firmly between the worst (40%) and best (65%) systems in the MUC-6 evaluation.
More importantly, the clustering approach outperforms the only MUC-6 system to treat coreference resolution as a learning problem.
The clustering algorithm appears to provide a flexible mechanism for coordinating the application of context-independent and context-dependent constraints and preferences for accurate partitioning of noun phrases into coreference equivalence classes.
We combine the use of WordNet with proper name gazetteers in order to obtain information on the compatibility of coreferential NPs in their clustering algorithm.
Approaches to coreference resolution that rely only on clustering can easily enforce transitivity.
We use pairwise NP distances to cluster document mentions.
Our system uses the node distance in WordNet (with an upper limit of 4) as one component in the distance measure that guides their clustering algorithm.
Coreference resolution is performed in two phases: a binary classification phase, in which the likelihood of coreference for each pair of noun phrases is assessed; and a partitioning phase, in which the clusters of mutually coreferring NPs are formed, maximizing some global criterion.
