A Noisy-Channel Approach To Question Answering
We introduce a probabilistic noisy-channel model for question answering and we show how it can be exploited in the context of an end-to-end QA system.
Our noisy-channel system outperforms a state-of-the-art rule-based QA system that uses similar resources.
We also show that the model we propose is flexible enough to accommodate within one mathematical framework many QA-specific resources and techniques, which range from the exploitation of WordNet, structured, and semi-structured databases to reasoning, and paraphrasing.
We have developed a noisy-channel model for QA, which explains how a sentence containing an answer to a given question can be rewritten into that question through a sequence of stochastic operations.
Another form of combining strategies for advanced QA is proposed: (1) a knowledge-based Q/A implementation based on syntactic/semantic processing is combined using a maximum-entropy framework with (2) a statistical noisy-channel algorithm for Q/A and (3) a pattern-based approach that learn from Web data.
