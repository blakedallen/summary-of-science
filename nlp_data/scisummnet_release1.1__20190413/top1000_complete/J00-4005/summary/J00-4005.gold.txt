On Coreferring: Coreference In MUC And Related Annotation Schemes
In this paper, it is argued that "coreference" annotations, as performed in the MUC community for example, go well beyond annotation of the relation of coreference proper.
As a result, it is not always clear what semantic relation these annotations are encoding.
The paper discusses a number of problems with these annotations and concludes that rethinking of the coreference task is needed before the task is expanded.
In particular, it suggests a division of labor whereby annotation of the coreference relation proper is separated from other tasks such as annotation of bound anaphora and of the relation between a subject and a predicative NP.
It suffers however from a number of problems (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000), chief among which is the fact that the one semantic relation expressed by the scheme, ident, conflates a number of relations that semanticists view as distinct: besides COREFERENCE proper, there are IDENTITY ANAPHORA, BOUND ANAPHORA, and even PREDICATION.
