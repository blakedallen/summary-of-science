Contextual Word Similarity And Estimation From Sparse Data
In recent years there is much interest in word cooccurrence relations, such as n-grams, verb-object combinations, or cooccurrence within a limited context.
This paper discusses how to estimate the probability of cooccurrences that do not occur in the training data.
We present a method that makes local analogies between each specific unobserved cooccurrence and other cooccurrences that contain similar words, as determined by an appropriate word similarity metric.
Our evaluation suggests that this method performs better than existing smoothing methods, and may provide an alternative to class based models.
We argue that using a relatively small number of classes to model the similarity between words may lead to substantial loss of information.
Clusters of similar words are evaluated by how well they are able to recover data items that are removed from the input corpus one at a time.
