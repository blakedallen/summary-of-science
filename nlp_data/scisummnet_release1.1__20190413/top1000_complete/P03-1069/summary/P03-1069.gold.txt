Probabilistic Text Structuring: Experiments With Sentence Ordering
Ordering information is a critical task for natural language generation applications.
In this paper we propose an approach to information ordering that is particularly suited for text-to-text generation.
We describe a model that learns constraints on sentence order from a corpus of domain-specific texts and an algorithm that yields the most likely order among several alternatives.
We evaluate the automatically generated orderings against authored texts from our corpus and against human subjects that are asked to mimic the model's task.
We also assess the appropriateness of such a model for multi-document summarization.
We build a conditional model of words across adjacent sentences, focusing on words in particular semantic roles.
We proposed an algorithm that computes the probability of two sentences being adjacent for ordering sentences.
As the features, we propose the Cartesian product of content words in adjacent sentences.
