The CoNLL-2010 Shared Task: Learning to Detect Hedges and their Scope in Natural Language Text
The CoNLL-2010 Shared Task was dedicated to the detection of uncertainty cues and their linguistic scope in natural language texts.
The motivation behind this task was that distinguishing factual and uncertain information in texts is of essential importance in information extraction.
The CoNLL-2010 shared task, aimed at detecting uncertainty cues in texts, focused on these phrases in trying to determine whether sentences contain uncertain information.
The goal of the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task is to develop linguistic scope detectors as well.
