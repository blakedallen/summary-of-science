  <S sid="2" ssid="2">edu Abstract We have recently completed the sixth in a series of "Message Understanding Conferences" which are designed to pro- mote and evaluate research in informa- tion extraction.</S>
  <S sid="3" ssid="3">MUC-6 introduced sev- eral innovations over prior MUCs, most notably in the range of different asks for which evaluations were conducted.</S>
  <S sid="4" ssid="4">We describe some of the motivations for the new format and briefly discuss some of the results of the evaluations.</S>
  <S sid="5" ssid="5">1 The MUC Evaluations We have just completed the sixth in a series of Message Understanding Conferences, which have been organized by NRAD, the RDT&amp;E division of the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveil- lance Center (formerly NOSC, the Naval Ocean Systems Center) with the support of DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</S>
  <S sid="6" ssid="6">This paper looks briefly at the history of these Conferences and then examines the considerations which led to the structure of MUC-6} The Message Understanding Conferences were initiated by NOSC to assess and to foster research on the automated analysis of military messages containing textual information.</S>
  <S sid="7" ssid="7">Although called "conferences", the distinguishing characteristic of the MUCs are not the conferences themselves, but the evaluations to which participants must submit in order to be permitted to attend the conference.</S>
  <S sid="8" ssid="8">For each MUC, participating roups have been given sample messages and instructions on the type of information to be extracted, and have developed a system to process uch messages.</S>
  <S sid="9" ssid="9">Then, shortly before the conference, participants are given a set of test messages to be run through their system (without making any changes to the system); the output of each participants system 1The full proceedings of the conference are to be distributed by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Ma- teo, California; earlier MUC proeeedings~ for MUC-3, 4, and 5, are also available from Morgan Kaufmann.</S>

  <S sid="11" ssid="11">mi l is then evaluated against a manually-prepared an- swer key.</S>
  <S sid="12" ssid="12">The MUCs are remarkable in part because of the degree to which these evaluations have defined a prograin of research and development.</S>
  <S sid="13" ssid="13">DARPA has a number of information science and technol- ogy programs which are driven in large part, by regular evaluations.</S>
  <S sid="14" ssid="14">The MUCs are notable, how- ever, in that they in large part have shaped the research program in information extraction and brought it to its current state} 2 Early History MUC-1 (1987) was basically exploratory; each group designed its own format for recording the information in the document, and there was no formal evaluation.</S>
  <S sid="15" ssid="15">By MUC-2 (1989), the task had crystalized as one of template filling.</S>
  <S sid="16" ssid="16">One re- ceives a description of a class of events to be iden- tiffed in the text; for each of these events one must fill a template with information about the event.</S>
  <S sid="17" ssid="17">The template has slots for information about the event, such as the type of event, the agent, the time and place, the effect, etc.</S>
  <S sid="18" ssid="18">For MUC-2, the template had 10 slots.</S>
  <S sid="19" ssid="19">Both MUC-1 and MUC- 2 involved sanitized forms of military messages about naval sightings and engagements.</S>
  <S sid="20" ssid="20">The second MUC also worked out the details of the primary evaluation measures, recall and pre- cision.</S>
  <S sid="21" ssid="21">To present it in simplest terms, suppose the answer key has Nke~ filled slots; and that a system fills Neor,.~t slots correctly and Nin~or,,~t incorrectly (with some other slots possibly left un- filled).</S>
  <S sid="22" ssid="22">Then Ncorrect recall - Nkey 2There were, however, a number of individual re- scmeh efforts in information extraction underway be- [bre the first MUC, including the work on information formatting of medieM narrative by Sager at New York University; the formatting of naval equipment failure reports by Marsh at the Naval Research Laboratory; and the DBG work by Logieon for RADC.</S>
  <S sid="23" ssid="23">466 Nco,,;,.ect prec is ion  = Ncorrect + Nincorrect For MUC-3 (1991), tile task shifted to reports of terrorist events ill Central and South Amer- ica, as reported in articles provided by the For- eign Broadcast Information Service, and the tem- plate becmne somewhat more complex (18 slots).</S>
  <S sid="24" ssid="24">This same task was used for MUC-4 (1992), with a further small increase in template complexity (24 slots).</S>
  <S sid="25" ssid="25">MUC-5 (1993), which was conducted as part of the Tipster program, a represented a substantial fllrther jump in task complexity.</S>
  <S sid="26" ssid="26">Two tasks were involved, international joint ventures and elec- tronic circuit fabrication, in two hmgnages, En- glish and Japanese.</S>
  <S sid="27" ssid="27">The joint venture task re- quired 11 templates with a total of 47 slots for the output double tile number of slots defined for MUC-4  and the task documentation was over 40 pages long.</S>
  <S sid="28" ssid="28">One innovation of MUC-5 was the use of a nested template structure.</S>
  <S sid="29" ssid="29">In earlier MUCs, each event had been represented as a single temi)late ?</S>
  <S sid="30" ssid="30">in effect, a single record in a data l)ase, with a large nuinber of attributes.</S>
  <S sid="31" ssid="31">This format proved awkward when an event had several participmlts (e.g., several victims of a terrorist attack) and one wanted to record a set of facts about each partic- ipant.</S>
  <S sid="32" ssid="32">This sort of information (:ould be ranch more easily recorded in the hierarchical structure introduced for MUC-5, in which there was a single template for an event, which pointed to a list of temI(lates, one for each particii)mlt in tile event;.</S>
  <S sid="33" ssid="33">4 3 MUC-6 :  initial goals 1)ARI)A convened a meeting of Tipster partici- pants and government representatives in Decca&gt; bet 1993 to define goals and tasks tot MUC-6) Among the goals which were identified were ?</S>
  <S sid="34" ssid="34">demonstrating taskqndependent component technologies of information extraction which would be immediately useflfl ?</S>
  <S sid="35" ssid="35">encouraging work to make information ex- tractioil systems in&lt;)re portable ?</S>
  <S sid="36" ssid="36">encouraging work on "deeper understanding" aTipster is a U.S. Govermnent program of research and development in the areas of inibrmation retrieval and information extraction.</S>
  <S sid="37" ssid="37">4In fact the MUC-5 structure wa~s much (nor(; com- plex, because there were separate temt)lates for prod- ucts, time, activities of organizations, etc.</S>
  <S sid="38" ssid="38">~The representatives of the resear(:h community were Jim Cowie, lS(.alph Grishman (commit;tee chair), Jerry Hobbs, Paul Jacobs, Lea Schubert, Carl Weir, and Ralph Weischedel.</S>
  <S sid="39" ssid="39">The government people at- tending wcre George Doddington, Donna Harman, Boyan Onyshkevych, John Prangc, Bill Schultheis, and Beth Sundheim.</S>
  <S sid="40" ssid="40">Each of these can been seen in part as a reaction to the trends in the prior MUCs.</S>
  <S sid="41" ssid="41">The MUC-5 tasks, in particular, had been quite complex and a great effort had been invested by the government in preparing the training and test data and by the participants in adapting their systems for these tasks.</S>
  <S sid="42" ssid="42">Most participants worked on the tasks for 6 months; a few (the Tipster contractors) had been at work on the tasks tbr consi(lerably longer.</S>
  <S sid="43" ssid="43">While the performance of solne systems was quite impressive (the best got 57% recall, 64% precision overall, with 73% recall and 74% t)recision on the 4 "(:or(;" template types), tile question naturally arose as to whether there were many apl)lieations tbr which art investment of one or several develop- ers over half-&gt;year (or more) could be justified.</S>
  <S sid="44" ssid="44">Furthermore, while so much effort had been ex- pended, a large portion was specific to tire partic- ular tasks.</S>
  <S sid="45" ssid="45">It wasnt clear whether much progress was being made on the underlying technologies which would be needed for hetter understanding.</S>
  <S sid="46" ssid="46">To address these goals, the meeting formulated an ambitious menu of tasks for MUC-6, with the idea that individual participants could choose a subset of these tasks.</S>
  <S sid="47" ssid="47">We consider the three goals in the three sections below, and describe the tasks which were developed to address each goal.</S>
  <S sid="48" ssid="48">4 Short-term subtasks The first goal was to identit~y, from the compo- nent technologies being developed for information extraction, flmctions which would be of 1)ractical use, would be largely domain indet)endent, and couhl in the near term be performed automatically with high ac(uracy.</S>
  <S sid="49" ssid="49">To meet this goal the con&gt; mittce developed the "named entity" task, which t(asically involves identifying the names of all the people, organizations, and geographic locations in a text.</S>
  <S sid="50" ssid="50">The final task specification, which also involved time, currency, and percentage xpressions, used SGML markup to identify the names in a text.</S>
  <S sid="51" ssid="51">Figure 1 shows a sample sentence with named en- tity annotations.</S>
  <S sid="52" ssid="52">The tag ENAMEX ("entity name expression") is used for both people and organiza- tion names; the tag NUNEX ( "numer ic  expression") is used for currency and I)ercentages.</S>
  <S sid="53" ssid="53">5 Portability The second goal was 1;o focus on portability in the inibrmation extraction task the ability to rapidly retarget a system to extract; information about a different class of events.</S>
  <S sid="54" ssid="54">The comnfit- tee felt that it was important o demonstrate that useful extraction systems eouht be created in a few weeks.</S>
  <S sid="55" ssid="55">To meet this goal, we decided that the infbrmation extraction task for MUC-6 wouhl have to involve a relatively simple template, more like MUC-2 than MUC-5; this was duhbed "mini- 467 Mr. &lt;ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON"&gt;Dooner&lt;/ENAMEX&gt; met with &lt;ENAMEX:TYPE="PERSON"&gt;Martin Puris&lt;/ENAMEX&gt;, president and chief executive officer of &lt;ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"&gt;Ammirati &amp; Puris&lt;/ENAMEX&gt;, about &lt;ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"&gt;McCann&lt;/ENAMEX&gt;~s acquiring the agency with billings of &lt;NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"&gt;$400 million&lt;/NUMEX&gt;, but nothing has materialized.</S>
  <S sid="56" ssid="56">Figure 1: Sample named entit;y annotation.</S>
  <S sid="57" ssid="57">In keeping with |;he hierarchical tem- plate structure introduced in MUC-5, it was envi- sioned |;hat the inini-MUC would have an event- level template pointing to templates representing |;he partieitmnts in the event (people, orgmfiza- tions, products, e.tc.</S>
  <S sid="58" ssid="58">), me(liated perhaps by a "re- lational" level template.</S>
  <S sid="59" ssid="59">To further increase portability, a proposal was made to standardize the lowest-level tenlplates (for peoph,, orgaIfizations, etc.</S>
  <S sid="60" ssid="60">), since these basic (:lasses are involved in a wide variety of actions.</S>
  <S sid="61" ssid="61">In this way, MUC participants could develop code for these low-level telnplates once, and then use them with many different types of events.</S>
  <S sid="62" ssid="62">These low- level t;emptates were named "telnplate lements".</S>
  <S sid="63" ssid="63">As the specification finally deveh)ped, tit(; rein- plate element for orgalfizations had six slots, for the inaximal organization alne, any aliases, the type, a descriptive noun phrase, the locale (inost specific location), and country.</S>
  <S sid="64" ssid="64">Slots are tilh,d only if inforlnation is explicitly given in the text (or, ill the ease of the country, can be inDrred Doln an explicit locale).</S>
  <S sid="65" ssid="65">The text We are striving to have a strong re- newed creative partnership with Coca- Cola," Mr. Dooner says.</S>
  <S sid="66" ssid="66">However, o(lds of that hapt;ening are slim since word from Coke headquarters in Atlanta is that... wouht yiehl an organization telnplate elenmnt with live of these six slots filled: &lt;0RGANIZATION-9402240133-5&gt; := ORG NAME: "Coca-Cola" ORG ALIAS: "Coke" ORG TYPE: COMPANY ORG_LOCALE: Atlanta CITY ORG COUNTRY: United States (the first line identities this as organization tenl- plate 5 from article 9402240]33).</S>
  <S sid="67" ssid="67">Ever on the lookout for additional ewfluation measmes, the committee decide, d to nlake the cre- ation of telnI)late eh,ments tbr all the people and organizations in a text a separate MUC task.</S>
  <S sid="68" ssid="68">lake the named entil;y task, this was also seen as a potential demonstration of the ability of systelns 1;o pertbrm a useflfl, relatively dolnain indepen- dent task with near-term extraction te(:hnoh)gy (although it was recognized as being more dilli- cult than named entity, since it required merging information from several places in the text).</S>
  <S sid="69" ssid="69">The old-style MUC information extraction task, based on a description of a particular (:lass of events (a "scenario") was called the "scenario template" task.</S>
  <S sid="70" ssid="70">A sample scenario template is shown in the appendix.</S>
  <S sid="71" ssid="71">6 Measures  o f  deep  unders tand ing Another concern which was noted about the MUCs is that tile systenls we.re tending to- wards relatively shallow understanding techlfiques (based IIrimarily on local pa.ttern inatching), and that not enough work was being done to build up the mechanisms needed for deeper understand- ing.</S>
  <S sid="72" ssid="72">Therefore, tile committee, with strong en- couragement front I)AII.PA, included three MUC tasks which were intended to measure, aspex:ts of the internal processing of an inforlnation extra(:- lion or hmguage understanding systenL These three tasks, which were collectively called Se- mEwfl ("Senmntic Ewfluation") were: ?</S>
  <S sid="73" ssid="73">Core ference:  the systent would have to mark coreferential noun t)hrases (the initial SlmCification envisioned marking set-subsel; and part-whole relations, ill addition to iden- tity relations) ?</S>
  <S sid="74" ssid="74">Word  sense d i sambiguat ion :  for each ope.n (:lass word (noun, verb, a, djective, ad- verb) in the text, the systein would have to determine its sense using the Wordlmt clas- s|Ileal|on (its "synset", in Wordnet termii~of ogy) ?</S>
  <S sid="75" ssid="75">Pred icate -argument  s t ruc ture :  the sys- tem wouhl have to create a tree interrelating the constituellts of the sentence, using sonm set of gralnma.tical flnmtional relations The committee recognized that, in seh;eting sneh internal measures, it, was inaking sortie presumI) tion regarding the structures and decisions which an analyzer should make in understanding a doc- llmellt.</S>
  <S sid="76" ssid="76">Not everyone would share these pre, sump- lions, lint participants in the next MU(J would be free 1;o enter the infornlation extraction evalu- ation and skip some or all of these internal ewdua- Lions.</S>
  <S sid="77" ssid="77">Language understanding technology might develop in ways very diIii?rent from those imagined by the committee, and these internal evaluations might turn ollt t() t)e irrelevant distractions.</S>
  <S sid="78" ssid="78">How- ever, froln the current perslmctive of tnost of the eolnmittec, @ese seenmd fairly ])asic aspects of unde, rstanding, and so an experinmnt in evahlat- ing them (and encouraging improvem(mt in them) 4:68 would I)e worl;hwhil(~.</S>

  <S sid="127" ssid="127">It can all be gone like that . "</S>
  <S sid="128" ssid="128">Figure 2: Sample coreference annotation.</S>
  <S sid="129" ssid="129">The majority of sites had recall and precision over 90%; the highest-scoring sys- tem had a recall of 96% and a precision of 97%.</S>
  <S sid="130" ssid="130">Although one must keep in mind the somewhat limited range of texts in the test set (all are from the Wall Street Journal, in particular), the re- sults are excellent.</S>
  <S sid="131" ssid="131">A couple of these systems have been commercialized, and several are being incor- porated into government text-processing systems.</S>
  <S sid="132" ssid="132">Given this level of performance, there is probably little point in repeating this task with the same ground rules in a future MUC (although there might be interest in processing monoease text and in performing comparable tasks oil a more varied corpus and for languages other than English).</S>
  <S sid="133" ssid="133">The template  e lement  task, while superfi- cially similar to named entities - ~ it is also based on identifying people and organizations ~ is sig- nificantly more difficult.</S>
  <S sid="134" ssid="134">One has to identify de- scriptions of entities ("a distributor of kumquats") as well as names.</S>
  <S sid="135" ssid="135">If an entity is mentioned sev- eral times, possibly using descriptions or differ- ent forms of a name, these need to be identified together; there should be only one template ele- ment for each entity in an article.</S>
  <S sid="136" ssid="136">Consequently, the scores were appreciably lower, ranging across most systems from 65 to 75% in recall, and from 75% to 85% in precision.</S>
  <S sid="137" ssid="137">The top-scoring sys- tem had 75% recall, 86% precision.</S>
  <S sid="138" ssid="138">Systems did particularly poorly in identifying descriptions; the highest-scoring system had 38% recall and 51% precision for descriptions.</S>
  <S sid="139" ssid="139">There seemed general agreement that having prepared code for template elements in advance did make it easier to port a system to a new see- nario in a few weeks.</S>
  <S sid="140" ssid="140">This factor, and the room that exists for improvement in performance, sug- gest that including this task in a future MUC may be worthwhile.</S>
  <S sid="141" ssid="141">The goal for scenar io  templates  mini- MUC - -  was to demonstrate that effective infor- mation extraction systems could be created in a few weeks.</S>
  <S sid="142" ssid="142">This too was successful.</S>
  <S sid="143" ssid="143">Although it is difficult to meaningfully compare results on differ- ent scenarios, the scores obtained by most systems after a few weeks (40% to 50% recall, 60% to 70% precision) were comparable to the best scores ob- tained in prior MUCs.</S>
  <S sid="144" ssid="144">The highest performance overall was 47% recall and 70% precision.</S>
  <S sid="145" ssid="145">One can observe an increasing convergence of methods tbr information extraction.</S>
  <S sid="146" ssid="146">Most of the systems participating in MUC-6 employed a cascade of finite-state pattern recognizers, with the earlier pattern sets recognizing entities, and the later sets recognizing scenario-specific pat- terns.</S>
  <S sid="147" ssid="147">This convergence may be one reason for tile bunching of scores for this task -- most sys- tems fell in a rather narrow range in both recall and precision.</S>
  <S sid="148" ssid="148">The results of this MUC provide valuable pos- itive testimony on behalf of information extra(&gt; tion, but further improvement in both portability and performance is needed tbr many applications.</S>
  <S sid="149" ssid="149">With respect o port~bility, custoiners would like to have systems which can be ported in a tew hours, or at most a few days, by someone with less expertise than a system developer.</S>
  <S sid="150" ssid="150">How this might be tested in the context of a MUC is not en- tirely clear.</S>
  <S sid="151" ssid="151">For one thing, most sites spent several days just studying the scenario description and annotated corpus, in order to understand tile sce- nario definition, before coding began.</S>
  <S sid="152" ssid="152">Perhaps a micro-MUC 9 with an even simpler template struc- ture, is needed to push the limits of port, ability.</S>
  <S sid="153" ssid="153">Getting systems which can be custonfized by oth- ers is also a tall order, given the complexity and variety of knowledge sources needed for a typical MUC information extraction task.</S>
  <S sid="154" ssid="154">With respect to performance, tile bunching of scores uggests that many sites were able to solve a common set of "easy" problems, but were stymied in processing messages which involved "hard" problems.</S>
  <S sid="155" ssid="155">Whether this is true, and just what the hard problems are, will require more extensive analysis of the results of MUC-6.</S>
  <S sid="156" ssid="156">Are the short- comings due primarily to a lack of coverage in the basic patterns, to a lack of background knowledge in the domain, to failures in coreference, or some- thing else?</S>
  <S sid="157" ssid="157">may hope that the failings are primarily in one area, so that we may concentrate our energies there, but more likely the failings will be in many areas, and broad improvements in ex- traction engines will be needed to improve perfor- mance.</S>
  <S sid="158" ssid="158">9a term suggested by George Krupka 470 Pushing improvements in the underlying tech- nology was one of tlm goals of SemEval and its current survivor, eoreference.. Much of tile en- ergy for the current round, however, went into honing the definition of the task.</S>
  <S sid="159" ssid="159">Philosol)hers of language have been arguing over reference and coreferencc for centuries, so we should not have been surprised that it would t)e so hard to pre- pare a precise and consistent definition.</S>
  <S sid="160" ssid="160">Addi- tional work on the definition will he necessary, and it may be necessary to narrow the task fllr- ther.</S>
  <S sid="161" ssid="161">Despite these distractions, a few interesting early results were ol)tained regarding eoreference methods; we may hot)e that, once the task specifi- cation settles down, the availability of coreference- aimotated corpora nd the chance for glory ill fltr- ther evaluations will einourage more work in this area.</S>
