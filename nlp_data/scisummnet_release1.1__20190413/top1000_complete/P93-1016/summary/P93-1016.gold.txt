Principle-Based Parsing Without Overgeneration
Overgeneration is the main source of computational complexity in previous principle-based parsers.
This paper presents a message passing algorithm for principle-based parsing that avoids the overgeneration problem.
This algorithm has been implemented in C++ and successfully tested with example sentences from (van Riemsdijk and Williams, 1986).
Our parser produces functional relations for the components in a sentence, including subject and object relations with respect to a verb.
In our dependency trees nodes represent text expressions and edges represent the syntactic relations between them.
