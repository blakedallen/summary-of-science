Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
We are developing corpus-based techniques for identifying semantic relations at an intermediate level of description (more specific than those used in case frames, but more general than those used in traditional knowledge representation systems).
In this paper we describe a classification algorithm for identifying relationships between two-word noun compounds.
We find that a very simple approach using a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from training instances, performing better on previously unseen words than a baseline consisting of training on the words themselves.
We classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound.
We use a discriminative classifier to assing 18 relations for noun compounds from biomedical text and achieve 60% accuracy.
