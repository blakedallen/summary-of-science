A Maximum Entropy Model For Prepositional Phrase Attachment
We construct a benchmark dataset of 27,937 pp-attachment quadruples extracted from the Wall Street Journal corpus.
We train a maximum entropy model on (v, n1, p, n2) quadruples extracted from the Wall Street Journal corpus and achieve 81.6% accuracy.
Our maximum entropy approach uses the mutual information clustering algorithm.
