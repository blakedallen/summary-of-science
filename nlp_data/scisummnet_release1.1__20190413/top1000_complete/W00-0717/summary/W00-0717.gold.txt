Inducing Syntactic Categories By Context Distribution Clustering
This paper addresses the issue of the automatic induction of syntactic categories from unannotated corpora.
Previous techniques give good results, but fail to cope well with ambiguity or rare words.
An algorithm, context distribution clustering (CDC), is presented which can be naturally extended to handle these problems.
We apply syntactic clustering and dimensionality reduction in a knowledge-free setting to obtain meaningful clusters.
In our bootstrapping approach we first cluster the most distributionally reliable words and then incrementallly augment each cluster with words that are distributionally similar to those already in the cluster.
