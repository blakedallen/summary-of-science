Identifying Agreement And Disagreement In Conversational Speech: Use Of Bayesian Networks To Model Pragmatic Dependencies
We describe a statistical approach for modeling agreements and disagreements in conversational interaction.
Our approach first identifies adjacency pairs using maximum entropy ranking based on a set of lexical, durational, and structural features that look both forward and backward in the discourse.
We then classify utterances as agreement or disagreement using these adjacency pairs and features that represent various pragmatic influences of previous agreement or disagreement on the current utterance.
Our approach achieves 86.9% accuracy, a 4.9% increase over previous work.
We define an adjacent pair to consist of two parts that are ordered, adjacent, and produced by different speakers.
We also achieved an 8% increase in speaker identification.
We consider speaker change, segment duration, and adjacency pair sequence dependency features using a dynamic Bayesian network.
We suggest that further gains can be achieved by augmenting the feature set.
