  <ABSTRACT>
    <S sid="1" ssid="1">Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.</S>
    <S sid="2" ssid="2">In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.</S>
    <S sid="3" ssid="3">In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms.</S>
    <S sid="4" ssid="4">On two stansemantic parsing benchmarks our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.</S>

  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="5" ssid="1">What is the total population of the ten largest capitals in the US?</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="2">Answering these types of complex questions compositionally involves first mapping the questions into logical forms (semantic parsing).</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="3">Supervised semantic parsers (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Kate and Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010) rely on manual annotation of logical forms, which is expensive.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="4">On the other hand, existing unsupervised semantic parsers (Poon and Domingos, 2009) do not handle deeper linguistic phenomena such as quantification, negation, and superlatives.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="5">As in Clarke et al. (2010), we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="6">However, we still model the logical form (now as a latent variable) to capture the complexities of language.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="7">Figure 1 shows our probabilistic model: with respect to a world w (database of facts), producing an answer y.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="8">We represent logical forms z as labeled trees, induced automatically from (x, y) pairs.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="9">We want to induce latent logical forms z (and parameters 0) given only question-answer pairs (x, y), which is much cheaper to obtain than (x, z) pairs.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="10">The core problem that arises in this setting is program induction: finding a logical form z (over an exponentially large space of possibilities) that produces the target answer y.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="11">Unlike standard semantic parsing, our end goal is only to generate the correct y, so we are free to choose the representation for z.</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="12">Which one should we use?</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="13">The dominant paradigm in compositional semantics is Montague semantics, which constructs lambda calculus forms in a bottom-up manner.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="14">CCG is one instantiation (Steedman, 2000), which is used by many semantic parsers, e.g., Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005).</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="15">However, the logical forms there can become quite complex, and in the context of program induction, this would lead to an unwieldy search space.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="16">At the same time, representations such as FunQL (Kate et al., 2005), which was used in Clarke et al. (2010), are simpler but lack the full expressive power of lambda calculus.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="17">The main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive (Section 2).</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="18">The logical forms in this framework are trees, which is desirable for two reasons: (i) they parallel syntactic dependency trees, which facilitates parsing and learning; and (ii) evaluating them to obtain the answer is computationally efficient.</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="19">We trained our model using an EM-like algorithm (Section 3) on two benchmarks, GEO and JOBS (Section 4).</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="20">Our system outperforms all existing systems despite using no annotated logical forms.</S>

  <SECTION title="2 Semantic Representation" number="2">
    <S sid="25" ssid="1">We first present a basic version (Section 2.1) of dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which captures the core idea of using trees to represent formal semantics.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="2">We then introduce the full version (Section 2.2), which handles linguistic phenomena such as quantification, where syntactic and semantic scope diverge.</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="3">We start with some definitions, using US geography as an example domain.</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="4">Let V be the set of all values, which includes primitives (e.g., 3, CA &#8712; V) as well as sets and tuples formed from other values (e.g., 3, {3, 4, 7}, (CA, {5}) &#8712; V).</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="5">Let P be a set of predicates (e.g., state, count &#8712; P), which are just symbols.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="6">A world w is mapping from each predicate p &#8712; P to a set of tuples; for example, w(state) = {(CA), (OR),... }.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="7">Conceptually, a world is a relational database where each predicate is a relation (possibly infinite).</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="8">Define a special predicate &#248; with w(&#248;) = V. We represent functions by a set of inputoutput pairs, e.g., w(count) = {(S, n) : n = |S|}.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="9">As another example, w(average) = {(S, &#175;x) : We write a DCS tree z as hp; r1 : c1; ... ; rm : cmi.</S>
    <S sid="34" ssid="10">Figure 2(a) shows an example of a DCS tree.</S>
    <S sid="35" ssid="11">Although a DCS tree is a logical form, note that it looks like a syntactic dependency tree with predicates in place of words.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="12">It is this transparency between syntax and semantics provided by DCS which leads to a simple and streamlined compositional semantics suitable for program induction.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="13">The basic version of DCS restricts R to join and aggregate relations (see Table 1).</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="14">Let us start by considering a DCS tree z with only join relations.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="15">Such a z defines a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with nodes as variables.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="16">The CSP has two types of constraints: (i) x &#8712; w(p) for each node x labeled with predicate p &#8712; P; and (ii) xj = yj0 (the j-th component of x must equal the j'-th component of y) for each edge (x, y) labeled with j0j &#8712; R. A solution to the CSP is an assignment of nodes to values that satisfies all the constraints.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="17">We say a value v is consistent for a node x if there exists a solution that assigns v to x.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="18">The denotation JzKw (z evaluated on w) is the set of consistent values of the root node (see Figure 2 for an example).</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="19">Computation We can compute the denotation JzKw of a DCS tree z by exploiting dynamic programming on trees (Dechter, 2003).</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="20">The recurrence is as follows: At each node, we compute the set of tuples v consistent with the predicate at that node (v &#8712; w(p)), and S(x)}, where a set of pairs S is treated as a set-valued function S(x) = {y : (x, y) &#8712; S} with domain S1 = {x : (x, y) &#8712; S}.</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="21">The logical forms in DCS are called DCS trees, where nodes are labeled with predicates, and edges are labeled with relations.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="22">Formally: Definition 1 (DCS trees) Let Z be the set of DCS trees, where each z &#8712; Z consists of (i) a predicate for each child i, the ji-th component of v must equal the j'i-th component of some t in the child&#8217;s denotation (t &#8712; JciKw).</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="23">This algorithm is linear in the number of nodes times the size of the denotations.1 Now the dual importance of trees in DCS is clear: We have seen that trees parallel syntactic dependency structure, which will facilitate parsing.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="24">In addition, trees enable efficient computation, thereby establishing a new connection between dependency syntax and efficient semantic evaluation.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="25">Aggregate relation DCS trees that only use join relations can represent arbitrarily complex compositional structures, but they cannot capture higherorder phenomena in language.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="26">For example, consider the phrase number of major cities, and suppose that number corresponds to the count predicate.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="27">It is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a CSP, so we introduce a new aggregate relation, notated E. Consider a tree hE:ci, whose root is connected to a child c via E. If the denotation of c is a set of values s, the parent&#8217;s denotation is then a singleton set containing s. Formally: Figure 3(a) shows the DCS tree for our running example.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="28">The denotation of the middle node is {s}, where s is all major cities.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="29">Having instantiated s as a value, everything above this node is an ordinary CSP: s constrains the count node, which in turns constrains the root node to |s|.</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="30">A DCS tree that contains only join and aggregate relations can be viewed as a collection of treestructured CSPs connected via aggregate relations.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="31">The tree structure still enables us to compute denotations efficiently based on (1) and (2).</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="32">The basic version of DCS described thus far handles a core subset of language.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="33">But consider Figure 4: (a) is headed by borders, but states needs to be extracted; in (b), the quantifier no is syntactically dominated by the head verb borders but needs to take wider scope.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="34">We now present the full version of DCS which handles this type of divergence between syntactic and semantic scope.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="35">The key idea that allows us to give semanticallyscoped denotations to syntactically-scoped trees is as follows: We mark a node low in the tree with a mark relation (one of E, Q, or C).</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="36">Then higher up in the tree, we invoke it with an execute relation Xi to create the desired semantic scope.2 This mark-execute construct acts non-locally, so to maintain compositionality, we must augment the denotation d = JzKw to include any information about the marked nodes in z that can be accessed by an execute relation later on.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="37">In the basic version, d was simply the consistent assignments to the root.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="38">Now d contains the consistent joint assignments to the active nodes (which include the root and all marked nodes), as well as information stored about each marked node.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="39">Think of d as consisting of n columns, one for each active node according to a pre-order traversal of z.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="40">Column 1 always corresponds to the root node.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="41">Formally, a denotation is defined as follows (see Figure 5 for an example): Definition 2 (Denotations) Let D be the set of denotations, where each d E D consists of where each store a contains a mark relation a.r E {E, Q, C, 0}, a base denotation a.b E D U{0}, and a child denotation a.c E D U{0}.</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="42">We write d as ((A; (ri, bi, ci); ... ; (rn, bn, cn))).</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="43">We use d{ri = x} to mean d with d.ri = d.ai.r = x (similar definitions apply for d{ai = x}, d{bi = x}, and d{ci = x}).</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="44">The denotation of a DCS tree can now be defined recursively: The base case is defined in (3): if z is a single node with predicate p, then the denotation of z has one column with the tuples w(p) and an empty store.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="45">The other six cases handle different edge relations.</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="46">These definitions depend on several operations (mj,j0, E, Xi, M) which we will define shortly, but let us first get some intuition.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="47">Let z be a DCS tree.</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="48">If the last child c of z&#8217;s root is a join (jj0), aggregate (E), or execute (Xi) relation ((4)&#8211;(6)), then we simply recurse on z with c removed and join it with some transformation (identity, E, or Xi) of c&#8217;s denotation.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="49">If the last (or first) child is connected via a mark relation E, C (or Q), then we strip off that child and put the appropriate information in the store by invoking M. We now define the operations mj,j0, E, Xi, M. Some helpful notation: For a sequence v = (v1,... , vn) and indices i = (i1, ... , ik), let vi = (vi1, ... , vik) be the projection of v onto i; we write v&#8722;i to mean v&#65533;1 i.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="50">Extending this notation to denotations, let (hA; &#945;ii[i] = hh{ai : a &#8712; A}; &#945;iii.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="51">Let d[&#8722;&#248;] = d[&#8722;i], where i are the columns with empty stores.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="52">For example, for d in Figure 5, d[1] keeps column 1, d[&#8722;&#248;] keeps column 2, and d[2, &#8722;2] swaps the two columns.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="53">Join The join of two denotations d and d' with respect to components j and j' (&#8727; means all components) is formed by concatenating all arrays a of d with all compatible arrays a' of d', where compatibility means a1j = a'1j0.</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="54">The stores are also concatenated (&#945; + &#945;').</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="55">Non-initial columns with empty stores are projected away by applying &#183;[1,&#8722;&#248;].</S>
    <S sid="80" ssid="56">The full definition of join is as follows: Aggregate The aggregate operation takes a denotation and forms a set out of the tuples in the first column for each setting of the rest of the columns: Now we turn to the mark (M) and execute (Xi) operations, which handles the divergence between syntactic and semantic scope.</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="57">In some sense, this is the technical core of DCS.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="58">Marking is simple: When a node (e.g., size in Figure 5) is marked (e.g., with relation C), we simply put the relation r, current denotation d and child c&#8217;s denotation into the store of column 1: The execute operation Xi(d) processes columns i in reverse order.</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="59">It suffices to define Xi(d) for a single column i.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="60">There are three cases: Extraction (d.ri = E) In the basic version, the denotation of a tree was always the set of consistent values of the root node.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="61">Extraction allows us to return the set of consistent values of a marked non-root node.</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="62">Formally, extraction simply moves the i-th column to the front: Xi(d) = d[i, &#8722;(i, &#248;)]{&#945;1 = &#248;}.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="63">For example, in Figure 4(a), before execution, the denotation of the DCS tree is hh{[(CA, OR), (OR)],... }; &#248;; (E, Qhstatei&#65533;w, &#248;)ii; after applying X1, we have hh{[(OR)], ... }; &#248;ii.</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="64">Generalized Quantification (d.ri = Q) Generalized quantifiers are predicates on two sets, a restrictor A and a nuclear scope B.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="65">For example, In a DCS tree, the quantifier appears as the child of a Q relation, and the restrictor is the parent (see Figure 4(b) for an example).</S>
    <S sid="90" ssid="66">This information is retrieved from the store when the quantifier in column i is executed.</S>
    <S sid="91" ssid="67">In particu- using the exact same machinery as superlatives.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="68">Figlar, the restrictor is A = E (d.bi) and the nu- ure 4(g) shows that we can naturally account for clear scope is B = E (d[i, &#8722;(i, 0)]).</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="69">We then superlative ambiguity based on where the scopeapply d.ci to these two sets (technically, denota- determining execute relation is placed. tions) and project away the first column: Xi(d) = 3 Semantic Parsing ((d.ci ./1,1 A) ./2,1 B) [&#8722;1].</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="70">We now turn to the task of mapping natural language For the example in Figure 4(b), the de- utterances to DCS trees.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="71">Our first question is: given notation of the DCS tree before execution is an utterance x, what trees z &#8712; Z are permissible?</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="72">To California cities), and it also allows us to underspecify L. In particular, our L will not include verbs or prepositions; rather, we rely on the predicates corresponding to those words to be triggered by traces.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="73">The augmentation function A takes a set of trees and optionally attaches E and Xi relations to the root (e.g., A(hcityi) = {hcityi , hcity; E:&#248;i}).</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="74">The filtering function F rules out improperly-typed trees such as hcity; 00:hstateii.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="75">To further reduce the search space, F imposes a few additional constraints, e.g., limiting the number of marked nodes to 2 and only allowing trace predicates between arity 1 predicates.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="76">Model We now present our discriminative semantic parsing model, which places a log-linear distribution over z &#8712; ZL(x) given an utterance x.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="77">Formally, p&#952;(z  |x) &#8733; e&#966;(x,z)T&#952;, where &#952; and &#966;(x, z) are parameter and feature vectors, respectively.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="78">As a running example, consider x = city that is in California and z = hcity; 11:hloc; 21:hCAiii, where city triggers city and California triggers CA.</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="79">To define the features, we technically need to augment each tree z &#8712; ZL(x) with alignment information&#8212;namely, for each predicate in z, the span in x (if any) that triggered it.</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="80">This extra information is already generated from the recursive definition in (13).</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="81">The feature vector &#966;(x, z) is defined by sums of five simple indicator feature templates: (F1) a word triggers a predicate (e.g., [city, city]); (F2) a word is under a relation (e.g., [that, 11]); (F3) a word is under a trace predicate (e.g., [in, loc]); (F4) two predicates are linked via a relation in the left or right direction (e.g., [city,11, loc, RIGHT]); and (F5) a predicate has a child relation (e.g., [city, 11]).</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="82">Learning Given a training dataset D containing (x, y) pairs, we define the regularized marginal log-likelihood objective O(&#952;) = E(x,y)ED log p&#952;(JzKw = y  |x, z &#8712; ZL(x)) &#8722; &#955;k&#952;k22, which sums over all DCS trees z that evaluate to the target answer y.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="83">Our model is arc-factored, so we can sum over all DCS trees in ZL(x) using dynamic programming.</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="84">However, in order to learn, we need to sum over {z &#8712; ZL(x) : JzKw = y}, and unfortunately, the additional constraint JzKw = y does not factorize.</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="85">We therefore resort to beam search.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="86">Specifically, we truncate each Ci,j to a maximum of K candidates sorted by decreasing score based on parameters &#952;.</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="87">Let &#732;ZL,&#952;(x) be this approximation of ZL(x).</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="88">Our learning algorithm alternates between (i) using the current parameters &#952; to generate the K-best set &#732;ZL,&#952;(x) for each training example x, and (ii) optimizing the parameters to put probability mass on the correct trees in these sets; sets containing no correct answers are skipped.</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="89">Formally, let &#732;O(&#952;, &#952;') be the objective function O(&#952;) with ZL(x) &#732;ZL,&#952;I(x).</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="90">We optimize &#732;O(&#952;,&#952;') by setting &#952;(0) = 0~ and iteratively solving &#952;(t+1) = argmax&#952; &#732;O(&#952;, &#952;(t)) using L-BFGS until t = T. In all experiments, we set &#955; = 0.01, T = 5, and K = 100.</S>
    <S sid="115" ssid="91">After training, given a new utterance x, our system outputs the most likely y, summing out the latent logical form z: argmaxy p&#952;(T)(y  |x, z &#8712; &#732;ZL,&#952;(T)).</S>

  <SECTION title="4 Experiments" number="3">
    <S sid="116" ssid="1">We tested our system on two standard datasets, GEO and JOBS.</S>
    <S sid="117" ssid="2">In each dataset, each sentence x is annotated with a Prolog logical form, which we use only to evaluate and get an answer y.</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="3">This evaluation is done with respect to a world w. Recall that a world w maps each predicate p &#8712; P to a set of tuples w(p).</S>
    <S sid="119" ssid="4">There are three types of predicates in P: generic (e.g., argmax), data (e.g., city), and value (e.g., CA).</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="5">GEO has 48 non-value predicates and JOBS has 26.</S>
    <S sid="121" ssid="6">For GEO, w is the standard US geography database that comes with the dataset.</S>
    <S sid="122" ssid="7">For JOBS, if we use the standard Jobs database, close to half the y&#8217;s are empty, which makes it uninteresting.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="8">We therefore generated a random Jobs database instead as follows: we created 100 job IDs.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="9">For each data predicate p (e.g., language), we add each possible tuple (e.g., (job37, Java)) to w(p) independently with probability 0.8.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="10">We used the same training-test splits as Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) (600+280 for GEO and 500+140 for JOBS).</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="11">During development, we further held out a random 30% of the training sets for validation.</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="12">Our lexical triggers L include the following: (i) predicates for a small set of &#8776; 20 function words (e.g., (most, argmax)), (ii) (x, x) for each value predicate x in w (e.g., (Boston, Boston)), and (iii) predicates for each POS tag in {JJ, NN, NNS} (e.g., (JJ, size), (JJ, area), etc.</S>
    <S sid="128" ssid="13">).3 Predicates corresponding to verbs and prepositions (e.g., traverse) are not included as overt lexical triggers, but rather in the trace predicates L(E).</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="14">We also define an augmented lexicon L+ which includes a prototype word x for each predicate appearing in (iii) above (e.g., (large, size)), which cancels the predicates triggered by x&#8217;s POS tag.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="15">For GEO, there are 22 prototype words; for JOBS, there are 5.</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="16">Specifying these triggers requires minimal domain-specific supervision.</S>
    <S sid="132" ssid="17">Results We first compare our system with Clarke et al. (2010) (henceforth, SEMRESP), which also learns a semantic parser from question-answer pairs.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="18">Table 2 shows that our system using lexical triggers L (henceforth, DCS) outperforms SEMRESP (78.9% over 73.2%).</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="19">In fact, although neither DCS nor SEMRESP uses logical forms, DCS uses even less supervision than SEMRESP.</S>
    <S sid="135" ssid="20">SEMRESP requires a lexicon of 1.42 words per non-value predicate, WordNet features, and syntactic parse trees; DCS requires only words for the domain-independent predicates (overall, around 0.5 words per non-value predicate), POS tags, and very simple indicator features.</S>
    <S sid="136" ssid="21">In fact, DCS performs comparably to even the version of SEMRESP trained using logical forms.</S>
    <S sid="137" ssid="22">If we add prototype triggers (use L+), the resulting system (DCS+) outperforms both versions of SEMRESP by a significant margin (87.2% over 73.2% and 80.4%).</S>
    <S sid="138" ssid="23">Next, we compared our systems (DCS and DCS+) with the state-of-the-art semantic parsers on the full dataset for both GEO and JOBS (see Table 3).</S>
    <S sid="139" ssid="24">All other systems require logical forms as training data, whereas ours does not.</S>
    <S sid="140" ssid="25">Table 3 shows that even DCS, which does not use prototypes, is comparable to the best previous system (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010), and by adding a few prototypes, DCS+ offers a decisive edge (91.1% over 88.9% on GEO).</S>
    <S sid="141" ssid="26">Rather than using lexical triggers, several of the other systems use IBM word alignment models to produce an initial word-predicate mapping.</S>
    <S sid="142" ssid="27">This option is not available to us since we do not have annotated logical forms, so we must instead rely on lexical triggers to define the search space.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="28">Note that having lexical triggers is a much weaker requirement than having a CCG lexicon, and far easier to obtain than logical forms.</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="29">Intuitions How is our system learning?</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="30">Initially, the weights are zero, so the beam search is essentially unguided.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="31">We find that only for a small fraction of training examples do the K-best sets contain any trees yielding the correct answer (29% for DCS on GEO).</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="32">However, training on just these examples is enough to improve the parameters, and this 29% increases to 66% and then to 95% over the next few iterations.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="33">This bootstrapping behavior occurs naturally: The &#8220;easy&#8221; examples are processed first, where easy is defined by the ability of the current model to generate the correct answer using any tree. with scope variation.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="34">Think of DCS as a higher-level Our system learns lexical associations between programming language tailored to natural language, words and predicates.</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="35">For example, area (by virtue which results in programs (DCS trees) which are of being a noun) triggers many predicates: city, much simpler than the logically-equivalent lambda state, area, etc.</S>
