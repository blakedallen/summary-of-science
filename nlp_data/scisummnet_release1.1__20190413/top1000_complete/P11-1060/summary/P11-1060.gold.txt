Learning Dependency-Based Compositional Semantics
Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.
In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.
In tackling this challenging learning problem, we introduce a new semantic representation which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms.
On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and JOBS), our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.
We DCS for dependency-based compositional semantics, which represents a semantic parse as a tree with nodes representing database elements and operations, and edges representing relational joins.
Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) provides an intuitive way to model semantics of questions, by using simple dependency-like trees.
