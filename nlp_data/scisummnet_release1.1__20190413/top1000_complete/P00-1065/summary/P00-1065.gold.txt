Automatic Labeling Of Semantic Roles
We present a system for identifying the semantic relationships, or semantic roles, filled by constituents of a sentence within a semantic frame.
Various lexical and syntactic features are derived from parse trees and used to derive statistical classifiers from hand-annotated training data.
We split the task into two sequential subtasks: first, argument recognition decides for each instance whether it bears a semantic role or not; then, argument labelling assigns a label to instances recognised as role-bearers.
We present a system that uses completely syntactic features to classify the Frame Elements in a sentence in the FrameNet database.
