Clustering Polysemic Subcategorization Frame Distributions Semantically
Previous research has demonstrated the utility of clustering in inducing semantic verb classes from undisambiguated corpus data.
We describe a new approach which involves clustering subcategorization frame (SCF) distributions using the Information Bottleneck and nearest neighbour methods.
In contrast to previous work, we particularly focus on clustering polysemic verbs.
A novel evaluation scheme is proposed which accounts for the effect of polysemy on the clusters, offering us a good insight into the potential and limitations of semantically classifying undisambiguated SCF data.
We evaluate hard clusterings based on a gold standard with multiple classes per verb.
We create a test set by considering verb polysemy on the basis of Levin's classes and the LCS database (Dorr, 1997).
Prepositional phrases (pp) are parameterized for two frequent sub categorization frames (NP and NP PP), and the unfiltered raw frequencies of subcategorization frames are used as features to represent a verb.
