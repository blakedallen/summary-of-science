Dependency Tree Kernels For Relation Extraction
We extend previous work on tree kernels to estimate the similarity between the dependency trees of sentences.
Using this kernel within a Support Vector Machine, we detect and classify relations between entities in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus of news articles.
We examine the utility of different features such as Wordnet hypernyms, parts of speech, and entity types, and find that the dependency tree kernel achieves a 20% F1 improvement over a bag-of-words kernel.
To compare relations in two instance sentences, we propose to compare the subtrees induced by the relation arguments i.e. computing the node kernel between the two lowest common ancestors (lca) in the dependecy tree.
We also use a dependency tree kernel to detect the Named Entity classes in natural language texts.
