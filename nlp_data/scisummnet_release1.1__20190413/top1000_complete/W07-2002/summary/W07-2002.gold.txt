SemEval-2007 Task 02: Evaluating Word Sense Induction and Discrimination Systems
The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other supervised and knowledge-based systems.
In total there were 6 participating systems.
We reused the SemEval-2007 English lexical sample subtask of task 17, and set up both clustering-style unsupervised evaluation (using Onto Notes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the part of the dataset for mapping).
We provide a comparison to the results of the systems participating in the lexical sample subtask of task 17.
The object of the sense induction task of SENSEVAL-4 is to cluster 27,132 instances of 100 different words (35 nouns and 65 verbs) into senses or classes.
Graph-based methods have been employed for word sense induction.
