Part-of-Speech Tagging for Twitter: Annotation Features and Experiments
We address the problem of part-of-speech tagging for English data from the popular micro-blogging service Twitter.
We develop a tagset, annotate data, develop features, and report tagging results nearing 90% accuracy.
The data and tools have been made available to the research community with the goal of enabling richer text analysis of Twitter and related social media data sets.
Recognizing the limitations of existing systems,we develop a POS tagger specifically for Twitter, by creating a training corpus as well as devising a tag set that includes parts of speech that are uniquely found in on line language, such as emoticons (smilies).
We release the Twitter POS dataset consisting of approximately 26,000 words across 1,827 tweets.
The Twitter dataset uses a domain-dependent tag set of 25 tags.
