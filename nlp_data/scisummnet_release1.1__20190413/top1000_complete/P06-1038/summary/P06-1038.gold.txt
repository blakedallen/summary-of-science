Efficient Unsupervised Discovery Of Word Categories Using Symmetric Patterns And High Frequency Words
We present a novel approach for discovering word categories, sets of words sharing a significant aspect of their meaning.
We utilize meta-patterns of high-frequency words and content words in order to discover pattern candidates.
Symmetric patterns are then identified using graph-based measures, and word categories are created based on graph clique sets.
Our method is the first pattern-based method that requires no corpus annotation or manually provided seed patterns or words.
We evaluate our algorithm on very large corpora in two languages, using both human judgments and WordNet-based evaluation.
Our fully unsupervised results are superior to previous work that used a POS tagged corpus, and computation time for huge corpora are orders of magnitude faster than previously reported.
We show that pairs of words that often appear together in symmetric patterns tend to belong to the same class (that is, they share some notable aspect of their semantics).
