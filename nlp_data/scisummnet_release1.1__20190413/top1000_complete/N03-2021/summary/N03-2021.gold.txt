Precision And Recall Of Machine Translation
Machine translation can be evaluated using precision, recall, and the F-measure.
These standard measures have significantly higher correlation with human judgments than recently proposed alternatives.
More importantly, the standard measures have an intuitive interpretation, which can facilitate insights into how MT systems might be improved.
The relevant software is publicly available.
We formulate a metric which measures translation accuracy in terms of precision and recall directly rather than precision and a brevity penalty.
