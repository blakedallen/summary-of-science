Learning Synchronous Grammars for Semantic Parsing with Lambda Calculus
This paper presents the first empirical results to our knowledge on learning synchronous grammars that generate logical forms.
Using statistical machine translation techniques, a semantic parser based on a synchronous context-free grammar augmented with lambda-operators is learned given a set of training sentences and their correct logical forms.
The resulting parser is shown to be the best-performing system so far in a database query domain.
We demonstrate that our meaning representation language outperforms FUNQL, another meaning representation language.
