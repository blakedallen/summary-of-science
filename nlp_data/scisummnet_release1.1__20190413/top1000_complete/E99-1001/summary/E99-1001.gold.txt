Named Entity Recognition Without Gazetteers
It is often claimed that Named Entity recognition systems need extensive gazetteers - lists of names of people, organisations, locations, and other named entities.
Indeed, the compilation of such gazetteers is sometimes mentioned as a bottleneck in the design of Named Entity recognition systems.
We report on a Named Entity recognition system which combines rule-based grammars with statistical (maximum entropy) models.
We report on the system's performance with gazetteers of different types and different sizes, using test material from the MUC-7 competition.
We show that, for the text type and task of this competition, it is sufficient to use relatively small gazetteers of well-known names, rather than large gazetteers of low-frequency names.
We conclude with observations about the domain independence of the competition and of our experiments.
We utilize the discourse level to disambiguate items in non predictive contexts.
We exploit label consistency information within a document using relatively ad hoc multi-stage labeling procedures.
