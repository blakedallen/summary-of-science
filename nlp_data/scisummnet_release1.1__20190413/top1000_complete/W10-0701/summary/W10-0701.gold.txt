Creating Speech and Language Data With Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanical Turk
In this paper we give an introduction to using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform for the purpose of collecting data for human language technologies.
We survey the papers published in the NAACL2010 Workshop.
24 researchers participated in the workshop’s shared task to create data for speech and language applications with $100.
We experiment with the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to create and evaluate human language data (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010).
We provide an overview of various tasks for which MTurk has been used, and offer a set of best practices for ensuring high-quality data.
