Detection of Grammatical Errors Involving Prepositions
This paper presents ongoing work on the detection of preposition errors of non-native speakers of English.
Since prepositions account for a substantial proportion of all grammatical errors by ESL (English as a Second Language) learners, developing an NLP application that can reliably detect these types of errors will provide an invaluable learning resource to ESL students.
To address this problem, we use a maximum entropy classifier combined with rule-based filters to detect preposition errors in a corpus of student essays.
Although our work is preliminary, we achieve a precision of 0.8 with a recall of 0.3.
Chodorow et al (2007) employed a maximum entropy model to estimate the probability of 34 prepositions based on 25 local context features ranging from words to NP/VP chunks.
A context is represented by 25 lexical features and 4 combination features: Lexical Token and POS n-grams in a 2 word window around the preposition, plus the head verb in the preceding verb phrase (PV), the head noun in the preceding noun phrase (PN) and the head noun in the following noun phrase (FN) when available.
