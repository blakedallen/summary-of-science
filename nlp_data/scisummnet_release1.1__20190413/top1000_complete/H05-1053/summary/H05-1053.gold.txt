Domain-Specific Sense Distributions And Predominant Sense Acquisition
Distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed.
This fact is exploited by word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems which back off to the predominant sense of a word when contextual clues are not strong enough.
The domain of a document has a strong influence on the sense distribution of words, but it is not feasible to produce large manually annotated corpora for every domain of interest.
In this paper we describe the construction of three sense annotated corpora in different domains for a sample of English words.
We apply an existing method for acquiring predominant sense information automatically from raw text, and for our sample demonstrate that (1) acquiring such information automatically from a mixed-domain corpus is more accurate than deriving it from SemCor, and (2) acquiring it automatically from text in the same domain as the target domain performs best by a large margin.
We also show that for an all words WSD task this automatic method is best focussed on words that are salient to the domain, and on words with a different acquired predominant sense in that domain compared to that acquired from a balanced corpus.
Our dataset is made up of 3 collections of documents: a domain-neutral corpus (BNC), and two domain-specific corpora (SPORTS and FINANCE).
