			<S sid="5" ssid="5">The task of labeling sequence data such as part-of speech (POS) tagging, chunking (shallow parsing)and named entity recognition is one of the most im portant tasks in natural language processing.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al,2001) have recently attracted much attention because they are free from so-called label bias prob lems which reportedly degrade the performance of sequential classification approaches like maximum entropy markov models (MEMMs).</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Although sequential classification approachescould suffer from label bias problems, they have sev eral advantages over CRFs.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">One is the efficiencyof training.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">CRFs need to perform dynamic programming over the whole sentence in order to compute feature expectations in each iteration of numerical optimization.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Training, for instance, second order CRFs using a rich set of features can require prohibitive computational resources.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">Max-marginmethods for structured data share problems of com putational cost (Altun et al, 2003).Another advantage is that one can employ a variety of machine learning algorithms as the local classifier.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">There is huge amount of work about developing classification algorithms that have high generalization performance in the machine learning community.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">Being able to incorporate such state-of-theart machine learning algorithms is important.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">Indeed, sequential classification approaches with kernel support vector machines offer competitive per formance in POS tagging and chunking (Gimenez and Marquez, 2003; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">One obvious way to improve the performance of sequential classification approaches is to enrich theinformation that the local classifiers can use.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">In stan dard decomposition techniques, the local classifiers cannot use the information about future tags (e.g. the right-side tags in left-to-right decoding), which would be helpful in predicting the tag of the targetword.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">To make use of the information about future tags, Toutanova et al proposed a tagging algo rithm based on bidirectional dependency networks 467(Toutanova et al, 2003) and achieved the best ac curacy on POS tagging on the Wall Street Journal corpus.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">As they pointed out in their paper, however,their method potentially suffers from ?collusion?</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">ef fects which make the model lock onto conditionally consistent but jointly unlikely sequences.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">In theirmodeling, the local classifiers can always use the in formation about future tags, but that could cause a double-counting effect of tag information.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">In this paper we propose an alternative way of making use of future tags.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">Our inference method considers all possible ways of decomposition andchooses the ?best?</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">decomposition, so the informa tion about future tags is used only in appropriate situations.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">We also present a deterministic versionof the inference method and show their effective ness with experiments of English POS tagging and chunking, using standard evaluation sets.</S>

			<S sid="25" ssid="1">The task of labeling sequence data is to find the se quence of tags t1...tn that maximizes the following probability given the observation o = o1...on P (t1...tn|o).</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="2">(1) Observations are typically words and their lexicalfeatures in the task of POS tagging.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="3">Sequential clas sification approaches decompose the probability as follows, P (t1...tn|o) = n?</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="4">i=1 p(ti|t1...ti?1o).</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="5">(2) This is the left-to-right decomposition.</S>

			<S sid="31" ssid="7">i=1 p(ti|ti?1o).</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="8">(3) Then we can employ a probabilistic classifier trained with the preceding tag and observations in order to obtain p(ti|ti?1o) for local classification.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="9">A common choice for the local probabilistic classifier is maximum entropy classifiers (Berger et al, 1996).</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="10">The best tag sequence can be efficiently computed by using a Viterbi decoding algorithm in polynomial time.</S>

			<S sid="36" ssid="12">The right-to-left decomposition is P (t1...tn|o) = n?</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="13">i=1 p(ti|ti+1o).</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="14">(4) These two ways of decomposition are widely usedin various tagging problems in natural language pro cessing.</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="15">The issue with such decompositions is that you have only the information about the preceding(or following) tags when performing local classifi cation.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="16">From the viewpoint of local classification, we want to give the classifier as much information as possible because the information about neighboring tags is useful in general.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="17">As an example, consider the situation where we are going to annotate a three-word sentence withpart-of-speech tags.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="18">Figure 1 shows the four possi ble ways of decomposition.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="19">They correspond to the following equations: (a) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t1|o)P (t2|t1o)P (t3|t2o) (5) (b) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t3|o)P (t2|t3o)P (t1|t2o) (6) (c) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t1|o)P (t3|o)P (t2|t3t1o) (7) (d) P (t1...t3|o) = P (t2|o)P (t1|t2o)P (t3|t2o) (8)(a) and (b) are the standard left-to-right and rightto-left decompositions.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="20">Notice that in decomposi tion (c), the local classifier can use the information about the tags on both sides when deciding t2.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="21">If, for example, the second word is difficult to tag (e.g.an unknown word), we might as well take the de composition structure (c) because the local classifier 468 can use rich information when deciding the tag of the most difficult word.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="22">In general if we have ann-word sentence and adopt a first-order markov assumption, we have 2n?1 possible ways of decomposition because each of the n ? 1 edges in the cor responding graph has two directions (left-to-right or right-to-left).</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="23">Our bidirectional inference method is to consider all possible decomposition structures and choose the ?best?</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="24">structure and tag sequence.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="25">We will show inthe next section that this is actually possible in poly nomial time by dynamic programming.As for the training, let us look at the equa tions of four different decompositions above.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="26">You can notice that there are only four types of local conditional probabilities: P (ti|ti?1o), P (ti|ti+1o), P (ti|ti?1ti+1o), and P (ti|o).This means that if we have these four types of lo cal classifiers, we can consider any decompositionstructures in the decoding stage.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="27">These local classi fiers can be obtained by training with corresponding neighboring tag information.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="28">Training the first twotypes of classifiers is exactly the same as the training of popular left-to-right and right-to-left sequen tial classification models respectively.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="29">If we take a second-order markov assumption, we need to train 16 types of local classifiers because each of the four neighboring tags of a classificationtarget has two possibilities of availability.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="30">In gen eral, if we take a k-th order markov assumption, we need to train 22k types of local classifies.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="31">2.1 Polynomial Time Inference.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="32">This section describes an algorithm to find the de composition structure and tag sequence that give the highest probability.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="33">The algorithm for the first-order case is an adaptation of the algorithm for decodingthe best sequence on a bidirectional dependency net work introduced by (Toutanova et al, 2003), which originates from the Viterbi decoding algorithm for second-order markov models.Figure 2 shows a polynomial time decoding algorithm for our bidirectional inference.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="34">It enumer ates all possible decomposition structures and tag sequences by recursive function calls, and finds the highest probability sequence.</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="35">Polynomial time isachieved by caching.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="36">Note that for each local clas sification, the function chooses the appropriate local function bestScore() { return bestScoreSub(n+2, ?end, end, end?, ?L,L?); } function bestScoreSub(i+1, ?ti?1, ti, ti+1?, ?di?1, di?)</S>

			<S sid="66" ssid="42">di is the direction of the edge between ti and ti+1.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="43">classifier by taking into account the directions of the adjacent edges of the classification target.</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="44">The second-order case is similar but slightly morecomplex.</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="45">Figure 3 shows the algorithm.</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="46">The recur sive function needs to consider the directions of the four adjacent edges of the classification target, and maintain the directions of the two neighboring edgesto enumerate all possible edge directions.</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="47">In addi tion, the algorithm rules out cycles in the structure.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="48">2.2 Decoding with the Easiest-First Strategy.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="49">We presented a polynomial time decoding algorithm in the previous section.</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="50">However, polynomial time is not low enough in practice.</S>
			<S sid="75" ssid="51">Indeed, even the Viterbi decoding of second-order markov models for POS tagging is not practical unless some pruning methodis involved.</S>
			<S sid="76" ssid="52">The computational cost of the bidirec tional decoding algorithm presented in the previoussection is, of course, larger than that because it enu merates all possible directions of the edges on top of the enumeration of possible tag sequences.</S>
			<S sid="77" ssid="53">In this section we present a greedy version of the decoding method for bidirectional inference, which 469 function bestScore() { return bestScoreSub(n+3, ?end, end, end, end, end?, ?L,L, L, L?, ?L,L?); } function bestScoreSub(i+2, ?ti?2, ti?1, ti, ti+1ti+2?, ?d?i?1, di?1, di, d?i+1?, ?di?2, d?i?) { // to avoid cycles if (di?1 = di &amp; di != d?i) return 0; // memorization if (cached(i+2, ?ti?2, ti?1, ti, ti+1ti+2?, ?d?i?1, di?1, di, d?i+1?, ?di?2, d?i?) return cache(i+2, ?ti?2, ti?1, ti, ti+1ti+2?, ?d?i?1, di?1, di, d?i+1?, ?di?2, d?i?); // left boundary case if (i = -2) if (?ti?2, ti?1, ti, ti+1, ti+2?</S>

			<S sid="85" ssid="61">is extremely simple and significantly more efficient than full bidirectional decoding.Instead of enumerating all possible decomposition structures, the algorithm determines the struc ture by adopting the easiest-first strategy.</S>

			<S sid="92" ssid="68">We assume in this paper that the ?easiest?</S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="69">word to tag is the word for which the classifier outputs the highest probability.</S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="70">In finding the easiest word, we use the appropriate local classifier according to the availability of the neighboring tags.</S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="71">Therefore,in the first iteration, we always use the local classi fiers trained with no contextual tag information (i.e.</S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="72">(P (ti|o)).</S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="73">Then, for example, if t3 has been tagged in the first iteration in a three-word sentence, we use P (t2|t3o) to compute the probability for tagging t2 in the second iteration (as in Figure 1 (b)).</S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="74">A naive implementation of this algorithm requires O(n2) invocations of local classifiers, where n is the number of the words in the sentence, because we need to update the probabilities over the words ateach iteration.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="75">However, a k-th order Markov as sumption obviously allows us to skip most of the probability updates, resulting in O(kn) invocations of local classifiers.</S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="76">This enables us to build a very efficient tagger.</S>

	<SECTION title="Maximum Entropy Classifier. " number="3">
			<S sid="101" ssid="1">For local classifiers, we used a maximum entropy model which is a common choice for incorporating various types of features for classification problems in natural language processing (Berger et al, 1996).</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="2">Regularization is important in maximum entropy modeling to avoid overfitting to the training data.</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="3">For this purpose, we use the maximum entropy modeling with inequality constraints (Kazama andTsujii, 2003).</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="4">The model gives equally good per formance as the maximum entropy modeling with Gaussian priors (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999), and the size of the resulting model is much smaller thanthat of Gaussian priors because most of the param eters become zero.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="5">This characteristic enables us to easily handle the model data and carry out quick decoding, which is convenient when we repetitivelyperform experiments.</S>

			<S sid="163" ssid="4">Kudo et al (2001) attained performance improvement in chunking by conducting weighted voting of multiple SVMs trained with distinct chunk representations.</S>
			<S sid="164" ssid="5">The biggest difference between ourapproach and such voting methods is that the lo cal classifier in our bidirectional inference methodscan have rich information for decision.</S>
			<S sid="165" ssid="6">Also, vot ing methods generally need many tagging processes to be run on a sentence, which makes it difficult to build a fast tagger.Our algorithm can be seen as an ensemble classi fier by which we choose the highest probability oneamong the different taggers with all possible decom position structures.</S>
			<S sid="166" ssid="7">Although choosing the highest probability one is seemingly natural and one of the simplest ways for combining the outputs of differenttaggers, one could use a different method (e.g. sum ming the probabilities over the outputs which share the same label sequence).</S>
			<S sid="167" ssid="8">Investigating the methods for combination should be an interesting direction of future work.</S>
			<S sid="168" ssid="9">As for the computational cost for training, our methods require us to train 22n types of classifiers when we adopt an nth order markov assumption.</S>
			<S sid="169" ssid="10">Inmany cases a second-order model is sufficient because further increase of n has little impact on per formance.</S>
			<S sid="170" ssid="11">Thus the training typically takes four or 16 times as much time as it would take for training a single unidirectional tagger, which looks somewhatexpensive.</S>
			<S sid="171" ssid="12">However, because each type of classi fier can be trained independently, the training can be performed completely in parallel and run with the same amount of memory as that for training a single classifier.</S>
			<S sid="172" ssid="13">This advantage contrasts with the case for CRFs which requires substantial amount ofmemory and computational cost if one tries to incor porate higher-order features about tag sequences.</S>
			<S sid="173" ssid="14">Tagging speed is another important factor inbuilding a practical tagger for large-scale text min 473 ing.</S>
			<S sid="174" ssid="15">Our inference algorithm with the easiest-first strategy needs no Viterbi decoding unlike MEMMs and CRFs, and makes it possible to perform very fast tagging with high precision.</S>

			<S sid="175" ssid="1">We have presented a bidirectional inference algo rithm for sequence labeling problems such as POStagging, named entity recognition and text chunking.</S>
			<S sid="176" ssid="2">The algorithm can enumerate all possible decomposition structures and find the highest prob ability sequence together with the corresponding decomposition structure in polynomial time.</S>
			<S sid="177" ssid="3">Wehave also presented an efficient bidirectional infer ence algorithm based on the easiest-first strategy,which gives comparable performance to full bidirectional inference with significantly lower compu tational cost.</S>
			<S sid="178" ssid="4">Experimental results of POS tagging and textchunking show that the proposed bidirectional inference methods consistently outperform unidi rectional inference methods and our bidirectional MEMMs give comparable performance to thatachieved by state-of-the-art learning algorithms in cluding kernel support vector machines.</S>
			<S sid="179" ssid="5">A natural extension of this work is to replace the maximum entropy modeling, which was used asthe local classifiers, with other machine learning algorithms.</S>
			<S sid="180" ssid="6">Support vector machines with appropri ate kernels is a good candidate because they havegood generalization performance as a single classi fier.</S>
