A Semantic Concordance
A semantic concordance is a textual corpus and a lexicon so combined that every substantive word in the text is linked to its appropriate sense in the lexicon.
Thus it can be viewed either as a corpus in which words have been tagged syntactically and semantically, or as a lexicon in which example sentences can be found for many definitions.
A semantic concordance is being constructed to use in studies of sense resolution in context (semantic disambiguation).
The Brown Corpus is the text and WordNet is the lexicon.
Semantic tags (pointers to WordNet synsets) are inserted in the text manually using an interface, ConText, that was designed to facilitate the task.
Another interface supports searches of the tagged text.
Some practical uses for semantic concordances are proposed.
We present SemCor, a balanced, semantically annotated dataset, with all content words manually tagged by trained lexicographers.
