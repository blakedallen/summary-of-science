Some Computational Properties Of Tree Adjoining Grammers
Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a formalism for natural language grammars.
Some of the basic notions of TAG's were introduced in [Joshi, Levy, and Takakashi 1975] and by [Joshi, 1983].
A detailed investigation of the linguistic relevance of TAG's has been carried out in [Kroch and Joshi, 1985].
In this paper, we will describe some new results for TAG's, especially in the following areas: (1) parsing complexity of TAG's, (2) some closure results for TAG's, and (3) the relationship to Head grammars.
We provide parsing algorithms for TAGs that could serve to parse the base formalism of a synchronous TAG.
We present the first TAG parser in a CYK-like algorithm.
