An Evaluation Exercise For Word Alignment
This paper presents the task definition, resources, participating systems, and comparative results for the shared task on word alignment, which was organized as part of the HLT/NAACL 2003 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts.
The shared task included Romanian-English and English-French sub-tasks, and drew the participation of seven teams from around the world.
We present a small dataset of 447 pairs of non-overlapping sentences which can be used to evaluate the performance of word-alignment systems.
