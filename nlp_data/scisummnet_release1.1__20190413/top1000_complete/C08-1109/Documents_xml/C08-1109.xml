			<S sid="5" ssid="5">The long-term goal of our work is to develop asystem which detects errors in grammar and us age so that appropriate feedback can be given to non-native English writers, a large and growing segment of the world?s population.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Estimates arethat in China alone as many as 300 million people are currently studying English as a second lan guage (ESL).</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Usage errors involving prepositions are among the most common types seen in thewriting of non-native English speakers.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">For ex ample, (Izumi et al, 2003) reported error rates for English prepositions that were as high as 10% ina Japanese learner corpus.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">Errors can involve incorrect selection (?we arrived to the station?), ex traneous use (?he went to outside?), and omission (?we are fond null beer?).</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">What is responsiblefor making preposition usage so difficult for non native speakers?</S>

			<S sid="14" ssid="14">At least part of the difficulty seems to be due tothe great variety of linguistic functions that prepositions serve.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">When a preposition marks the argument of a predicate, such as a verb, an adjective, or a noun, preposition selection is con strained by the argument role that it marks, thenoun which fills that role, and the particular predi cate.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">Many English verbs also display alternations (Levin, 1993) in which an argument is sometimes marked by a preposition and sometimes not (e.g., ?They loaded the wagon with hay?</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">/ ?They loaded hay on the wagon?).</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">When prepositions introduceadjuncts, such as those of time or manner, selec tion is constrained by the object of the preposition (?at length?, ?in time?, ?with haste?).</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">Finally, the selection of a preposition for a given context also depends upon the intended meaning of the writer (?we sat at the beach?, ?on the beach?, ?near the beach?, ?by the beach?).</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">With so many sources of variation in Englishpreposition usage, we wondered if the task of se lecting a preposition for a given context might prove challenging even for native speakers.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">To investigate this possibility, we randomly selected200 sentences from Microsoft?s Encarta Encyclopedia, and, in each sentence, we replaced a ran domly selected preposition with a blank line.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">We then asked two native English speakers to perform a cloze task by filling in the blank with the best preposition, given the context provided by the rest of the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">Our results showed only about75% agreement between the two raters, and be tween each of our raters and Encarta.The presence of so much variability in prepo sition function and usage makes the task of thelearner a daunting one.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">It also poses special chal lenges for developing and evaluating an NLP error detection system.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">This paper addresses both the 865 development and evaluation of such a system.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="26">First, we describe a machine learning system that detects preposition errors in essays of ESL writers.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="27">To date there have been relatively few attempts to address preposition error detection,though the sister task of detecting determiner errors has been the focus of more research.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="28">Our system performs comparably with other leading sys tems.</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="29">We extend our previous work (Chodorow etal., 2007) by experimenting with combination fea tures, as well as features derived from the Google N-Gram corpus and Comlex (Grishman et al, 1994).Second, we discuss drawbacks in current meth ods of annotating ESL data and evaluating errordetection systems, which are not limited to prepo sition errors.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="30">While the need for annotation by multiple raters has been well established in NLP tasks (Carletta, 1996), most previous work in error detection has surprisingly relied on only one raterto either create an annotated corpus of learner errors, or to check the system?s output.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="31">Some grammatical errors, such as number disagreement be tween subject and verb, no doubt show very highreliability, but others, such as usage errors involv ing prepositions or determiners are likely to be much less reliable.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="32">Our results show that relyingon one rater for system evaluation can be problem atic, and we provide a sampling approach which can facilitate using multiple raters for this task.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="33">In the next section, we describe a system that automatically detects errors involving incorrect preposition selection (?We arrived to the station?)</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="34">and extraneous preposition usage (?He went to outside?).</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="35">In sections 3 and 4, we discuss theproblem of relying on only one rater for exhaus tive annotation and show how multiple raters can be used more efficiently with a sampling approach.Finally, in section 5 we present an analysis of com mon preposition errors that non-native speakers make.</S>

			<S sid="36" ssid="1">2.1 Model.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="2">We have used a Maximum Entropy (ME) classi fier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to build a model of correctpreposition usage for 34 common English prepo sitions.</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="3">The classifier was trained on 7 million preposition contexts extracted from parts of the MetaMetrics Lexile corpus that contain textbooks and other materials for high school students.</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="4">Each context was represented by 25 features consisting of the words and part-of-speech (POS) tags found in a local window of +/- two positions around the preposition, plus the head verb of the preceding verb phrase (PV), the head noun of the precedingnoun phrase (PN), and the head noun of the following noun phrase (FH), among others.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="5">In analyzing the contexts, we used only tagging and heuris tic phrase-chunking, rather than parsing, so as to avoid problems that a parser might encounter with ill-formed non-native text 1 . In test mode, the clas-.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="6">sifier was given the context in which a preposition occurred, and it returned a probability for each of the 34 prepositions.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="7">2.2 Other Components.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="8">While the ME classifier constitutes the core of thesystem, it is only one of several processing com ponents that refines or blocks the system?s output.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="9">Since the goal of an error detection system is to provide diagnostic feedback to a student, typically a system?s output is heavily constrained so that it minimizes false positives (i.e., the system tries toavoid saying a writer?s preposition is used incor rectly when it is actually right), and thus does not mislead the writer.Pre-Processing Filter: A pre-processing pro gram skips over preposition contexts that contain spelling errors.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="10">Classifier performance is poor in such cases because the classifier was trained on well-edited text, i.e., without misspelled words.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="11">Inthe context of a diagnostic feedback and assess ment tool for writers, a spell checker would first highlight the spelling errors and ask the writer tocorrect them before the system analyzed the prepo sitions.Post-Processing Filter: After the ME clas sifier has output a probability for each of the 34prepositions but before the system has made its fi nal decision, a series of rule-based post-processingfilters block what would otherwise be false posi tives that occur in specific contexts.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="12">The first filter prevents the classifier from marking as an error acase where the classifier?s most probable preposi tion is an antonym of what the writer wrote, such as ?with/without?</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="13">and ?from/to?.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="14">In these cases, resolution is dependent on the intent of the writerand thus is outside the scope of information cap 1 For an example of a common ungrammatical sentence from our corpus, consider: ?In consion, for some reasons,museums, particuraly known travel place, get on many peo ple.?</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="15">866 tured by the current feature set.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="16">Another problem for the classifier involves differentiating between certain adjuncts and arguments.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="17">For example, in the sentence ?They described a part for a kid?, thesystem?s top choices were of and to.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="18">The benefac tive adjunct introduced by for is difficult for theclassifier to learn, perhaps because it so freely occurs in many locations within a sentence.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="19">A post processing filter prevents the system from marking as an error a prepositional phrase that begins with for and has an object headed by a human noun (a WordNet hyponym of person or group).</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="20">Extraneous Use Filter: To cover extraneous use errors, we developed two rule-based filters: 1) Plural Quantifier Constructions, to handle casessuch as ?some of people?</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="21">and 2) Repeated Prepo sitions, where the writer accidentally repeated the same preposition two or more times, such as ?canfind friends with with?.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="22">We found that extrane ous use errors usually constituted up to 18% of all preposition errors, and our extraneous use filters handle a quarter of that 18%.Thresholding: The final step for the preposi tion error detection system is a set of thresholds that allows the system to skip cases that are likely to result in false positives.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="23">One of these is wherethe top-ranked preposition and the writer?s prepo sition differ by less than a pre-specified amount.</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="24">This was also meant to avoid flagging cases where the system?s preposition has a score only slightly higher than the writer?s preposition score, such as: ?My sister usually gets home around 3:00?</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="25">(writer: around = 0.49, system: by = 0.51).</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="26">In these cases, the system?s and the writer?s prepositions both fit the context, and it would be inappropriate to claimthe writer?s preposition was used incorrectly.</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="27">Another system threshold requires that the probability of the writer?s preposition be lower than a pre specified value in order for it to be flagged as anerror.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="28">The thresholds were set so as to strongly fa vor precision over recall due to the high number offalse positives that may arise if there is no thresh olding.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="29">This is a tactic also used for determiner selection in (Nagata et al, 2006) and (Han et al, 2006).</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="30">Both thresholds were empirically set on a development corpus.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="31">2.3 Combination Features.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="32">ME is an attractive choice of machine learning al gorithm for a problem as complex as preposition error detection, in no small part because of theavailability of ME implementations that can han dle many millions of training events and features.</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="33">However, one disadvantage of ME is that it does not automatically model the interactions amongfeatures as some other approaches do, such as sup port vector machines (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008).To overcome this, we have experimented with aug menting our original feature set with ?combinationfeatures?</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="34">which represent richer contextual struc ture in the form of syntactic patterns.Table 1 (first column) illustrates the four com bination features used for the example context ?take our place in the line?.</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="35">The p denotes a preposition, so N-p-N denotes a syntactic context where the preposition is preceded and followed by a noun phrase.</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="36">We use the preceding noun phrase (PN) and following head (FH) from the original feature set for the N-p-N feature.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="37">Column 3 shows one instantiation of combination features:Combo:word.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="38">For the N-p-N feature, the corresponding Combo:word instantiation is ?place line?</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="39">since ?place?</S>
			<S sid="75" ssid="40">is the PN and ?line?</S>
			<S sid="76" ssid="41">is theFH.</S>
			<S sid="77" ssid="42">We also experimented with using combinations of POS tags (Combo:tag) and word+tag com binations (Combo:word+tag).</S>
			<S sid="78" ssid="43">So for the example, the Combo:tag N-p-N feature would be ?NN-NN?, and the Combo:word+tag N-p-N feature would beplace NN+line NN (see the fourth column of Ta ble 1).</S>
			<S sid="79" ssid="44">The intuition with the Combo:tag features is that the Combo:word features have the potentialto be sparse, and these capture more general pat terns of usage.</S>
			<S sid="80" ssid="45">We also experimented with other features such as augmenting the model with verb-preposition preferences derived from Comlex (Grishman et al, 1994), and querying the Google Terabyte N-gramcorpus with the same patterns used in the combina tion features.</S>
			<S sid="81" ssid="46">The Comlex-based features did not improve the model, and though the Google N-gram corpus represents much more information than our7 million event model, its inclusion improved per formance only marginally.</S>
			<S sid="82" ssid="47">2.4 Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="83" ssid="48">In our initial evaluation of the system we col lected a corpus of 8,269 preposition contexts,error-annotated by two raters using the scheme de scribed in Section 3 to serve as a gold standard.</S>
			<S sid="84" ssid="49">In this study, we focus on two of the three types of preposition errors: using the incorrect preposition and using an extraneous preposition.</S>
			<S sid="85" ssid="50">We compared 867 Class Components Combo:word Features Combo:tag Features p-N FH line NN N-p-N PN-FH place-line NN-NN V-p-N PV-PN take-line VB-NN V-N-p-N PV-PN-FH take-place-line VB-NN-NN Table 1: Feature Examples for take our place in the line different models: the baseline model of 25 features and baseline with combination features added.</S>
			<S sid="86" ssid="51">Theprecision and recall for the top performing models are shown in Table 2.</S>
			<S sid="87" ssid="52">These results do not in clude the extraneous use filter; this filter generally increased precision by as much as 2% and recall by as much as 5%.</S>
			<S sid="88" ssid="53">Evaluation Metrics In the tasks of determiner and preposition selection in well-formed, nativetexts (such as (Knight and Chander, 1994), (Min nen et al, 2000), (Turner and Charniak, 2007) and (Gamon et al, 2008)), the evaluation metric most commonly used is accuracy.</S>
			<S sid="89" ssid="54">In these tasks, one compares the system?s output on a determiner or preposition to the gold standard of what the writeroriginally wrote.</S>
			<S sid="90" ssid="55">However, in the tasks of deter miner and preposition error detection, precision and recall are better metrics to use because oneis only concerned with a subset of the preposi tions (or determiners), those used incorrectly, as opposed to all of them in the selection task.</S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="56">In essence, accuracy has the problem of distorting system performance.</S>
			<S sid="92" ssid="57">Results The baseline system (described in(Chodorow et al, 2007)) performed at 79.8% precision and 11.7% recall.</S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="58">Next we tested the differ ent combination models: word, tag, word+tag, andall three.</S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="59">Surprisingly, three of the four combina tion models: tag, word+tag, all, did not improve performance of the system when added to the model, but using just the +Combo:word features improved recall by 1%.</S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="60">We use the +Combo:word model to test our sampling approach in section 4.</S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="61">As a final test, we tuned our training corpus of 7 million events by removing any contexts with unknown or misspelled words, and then retrained the model.</S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="62">This ?purge?</S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="63">resulted in a removal of nearly 200,000 training events.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="64">With this new training corpus, the +Combo:tag feature showed the biggest improvement over the baseline, withan improvement in both precision (+2.3%) and re call (+2.4%) to 82.1% and 14.1% respectively (last line of Table 2.</S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="65">While this improvement may seemsmall, it is in part due to the difficulty of the prob lem, but also the high baseline system score that was established in our prior work (Chodorow et al., 2007).</S>
			<S sid="101" ssid="66">It should be noted that with the inclusion of the extraneous use filter, performance of the +Combo:tag rose to 84% precision and close to 19% recall.</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="67">Model Precision Recall Baseline 79.8% 11.7% +Combo:word 79.8% 12.8% +Combo:tag (with purge) 82.1% 14.1%Table 2: Best System Results on Incorrect Selec tion Task 2.5 Related Work.</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="68">Currently there are only a handful of approachesthat tackle the problem of preposition error detec tion in English learner texts.</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="69">(Gamon et al, 2008)used a language model and decision trees to de tect preposition and determiner errors in the CLEC corpus of learner essays.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="70">Their system performs at 79% precision (which is on par with our system),however recall figures are not presented thus making comparison difficult.</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="71">In addition, their eval uation differs from ours in that they also include errors of omission, and their work focuses on the top twelve most frequent prepositions, while ours has greater coverage with the top 34.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="72">(Izumi etal., 2003) and (Izumi et al, 2004) used an ME ap proach to classify different grammatical errors in transcripts of Japanese interviews.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="73">They do not present performance of prepositions specifically, but overall performance for the 13 error types they target reached 25% precision and 7% recall.(Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003) created a rule based approach to detecting preposition errors in Swedish language learners (unlike the approaches presented here, which focus on English languagelearners), and their system performed at 25% ac curacy.</S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="74">(Lee and Seneff, 2006) used a language model to tackle the novel problem of prepositionselection in a dialogue corpus.</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="75">While their perfor mance results are quite high, 88% precision and 868 78% recall, it should be noted that their evaluation was on a small corpus with a highly constraineddomain, and focused on a limited number of prepo sitions, thus making direct comparison with our approach difficult.Although our recall figures may seem low, es pecially when compared to other NLP tasks such as parsing and anaphora resolution, this is really a reflection of how difficult the task is. For example, in the problem of preposition selection in native text, a baseline using the most frequent preposition(of) results in precision and recall of 26%.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="76">In addi tion, the cloze tests presented earlier indicate thateven in well-formed text, agreement between na tive speakers on preposition selection is only 75%.In texts written by non-native speakers, rater dis agreement increases, as will be shown in the next section.</S>

			<S sid="112" ssid="1">While developing an error detection system forprepositions is certainly challenging, given the re sults from our work and others, evaluation also poses a major challenge.</S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="2">To date, single human annotation has typically been the gold standard for grammatical error detection, such as in the work of (Izumi et al, 2004), (Han et al, 2006), (Nagata et al, 2006), (Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003) 2 .Another method for evaluation is verification ((Ga mon et al, 2008), where a human rater checks over a system?s output.</S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="3">The drawbacks of this approach are: 1.</S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="4">every time the system is changed, a rater is needed to re-check the output, and 2.</S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="5">it is very hard to estimate recall.</S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="6">What these two evaluation methods have in common is that they side-step the issue of annotator reliability.</S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="7">In this section, we show how relying on only onerater can be problematic for difficult error detec tion tasks, and in section 4, we propose a method(?the sampling approach?)</S>
			<S sid="119" ssid="8">for efficiently evaluat ing a system that does not require the amount ofeffort needed in the standard approach to annota tion.</S>
			<S sid="120" ssid="9">3.1 Annotation.</S>
			<S sid="121" ssid="10">To create a gold-standard corpus of error annotations for system evaluation, and also to deter mine whether multiple raters are better than one, 2(Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003) had a small evaluation on 40 preposition contexts and it is unclear whether mul tiple annotators were used.</S>
			<S sid="122" ssid="11">we trained two native English speakers with prior NLP annotation experience to annotate prepositionerrors in ESL text.</S>
			<S sid="123" ssid="12">The training was very extensive: both raters were trained on 2000 preposition contexts and the annotation manual was it eratively refined as necessary.</S>
			<S sid="124" ssid="13">To summarize the procedure, the two raters were shown sentences randomly selected from student essays with each preposition highlighted in the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="125" ssid="14">They marked each context (?2-word window around thepreposition, plus the commanding verb) for gram mar and spelling errors, and then judged whether the writer used an incorrect preposition, a correct preposition, or an extraneous preposition.</S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="15">Finally, the raters suggested prepositions that would best fit the context, even if there were no error (some contexts can license multiple prepositions).</S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="16">3.2 Reliability.</S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="17">Each rater judged approximately 18,000 prepo sitions contexts, with 18 sets of 100 contextsjudged by both raters for purposes of comput ing kappa.</S>
			<S sid="129" ssid="18">Despite the rigorous training regimen, kappa ranged from 0.411 to 0.786, with an overall combined value of 0.630.</S>
			<S sid="130" ssid="19">Of the prepositions that Rater 1 judged to be errors, Rater 2 judged 30.2% to be acceptable.</S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="20">Conversely, of the prepositions Rater 2 judged to be erroneous, Rater 1 found 38.1% acceptable.</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="21">The kappa of 0.630 shows the difficulty of this task and also shows how two highly trained raters can produce very different judgments.</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="22">Details on our annotation and human judgment experiments can be found in (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008).</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="23">Variability in raters?</S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="24">judgments translates to variability of system evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="136" ssid="25">For instance, in our previous work (Chodorow et al, 2007), wefound that when our system?s output was com pared to judgments of two different raters, therewas a 10% difference in precision and a 5% differ ence in recall.</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="26">These differences are problematicwhen evaluating a system, as they highlight the potential to substantially over- or under-estimate per formance.</S>
	</SECTION>
	<SECTION title="Sampling Approach. " number="4">
			<S sid="138" ssid="1">The results from the previous section motivate theneed for a more refined evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="139" ssid="2">They sug gest that for certain error annotation tasks, such as preposition usage, it may not be appropriate to use only one rater and that if one uses multiple raters 869for error annotation, there is the possibility of cre ating an adjudicated set, or at least calculating the variability of the system?s performance.</S>
			<S sid="140" ssid="3">However,annotation with multiple raters has its own disadvantages as it is much more expensive and time consuming.</S>
			<S sid="141" ssid="4">Even using one rater to produce a sizeable evaluation corpus of preposition errors is extremely costly.</S>
			<S sid="142" ssid="5">For example, if we assume that500 prepositions can be annotated in 4 hours us ing our annotation scheme, and that the base rate for preposition errors is 10%, then it would take atleast 80 hours for a rater to find and mark 1000 er rors.</S>
			<S sid="143" ssid="6">In this section, we propose a more efficient annotation approach to circumvent this problem.</S>
			<S sid="144" ssid="7">4.1 Methodology.</S>
			<S sid="145" ssid="8">Figure 1: Sampling Approach ExampleThe sampling procedure outlined here is inspired by the one described in (Chodorow and Lea cock, 2000) for the task of evaluating the usage of nouns, verbs and adjectives.</S>
			<S sid="146" ssid="9">The central idea is to skew the annotation corpus so that it contains a greater proportion of errors.</S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="10">Here are the steps in the procedure: 1.</S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="11">Process a test corpus of sentences so that each.</S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="12">preposition in the corpus is labeled ?OK? or ?Error?</S>
			<S sid="150" ssid="13">by the system.</S>
			<S sid="151" ssid="14">2.</S>
			<S sid="152" ssid="15">Divide the processed corpus into two sub-.</S>
			<S sid="153" ssid="16">corpora, one consisting of the system?s ?OK? prepositions and the other of the system?s ?Error?</S>
			<S sid="154" ssid="17">prepositions.</S>
			<S sid="155" ssid="18">For the hypotheticaldata in Figure 1, the ?OK? sub-corpus con tains 90% of the prepositions, and the ?Error?</S>
			<S sid="156" ssid="19">sub-corpus contains the remaining 10%.</S>
			<S sid="157" ssid="20">3.</S>

			<S sid="192" ssid="55">In addition, while our methodology is used for evaluating a system, active learning is commonly used for training a system.</S>
			<S sid="193" ssid="56">4.2 Application.</S>
			<S sid="194" ssid="57">Next, we tested whether our proposed sampling approach provides good estimates of a sys tem?s performance.</S>
			<S sid="195" ssid="58">For this task, we used the +Combo:word model to separate a large corpusof student essays into the ?Error?</S>
			<S sid="196" ssid="59">and ?OK? sub corpora.</S>
			<S sid="197" ssid="60">The original corpus totaled over 22,000 prepositions which would normally take several weeks for two raters to double annotate and thenadjudicate.</S>
			<S sid="198" ssid="61">After the two sub-corpora were propor tionally sampled, this resulted in an annotation set of 752 preposition contexts (requiring roughly 6 hours for annotation), which is substantially more manageable than the full corpus.</S>
			<S sid="199" ssid="62">We had both raters work together to make judgments for each preposition.</S>
			<S sid="200" ssid="63">It is important to note that while these are notthe exact same essays used in the previous evalua tion of 8,269 preposition contexts, they come from the same pool of student essays and were on the same topics.</S>
			<S sid="201" ssid="64">Given these strong similarities, we feel that one can compare scores between the two approaches.</S>
			<S sid="202" ssid="65">The precision and recall scores forboth approaches are shown in Table 4 and are ex tremely similar, thus suggesting that the samplingapproach can be used as an alternative to exhaus tive annotation.</S>
			<S sid="203" ssid="66">Precision Recall Standard Approach 80% 12% Sampling Approach 79% 14% Table 4: Sampling Results It is important with the sampling approach to use appropriate sample sizes when drawing from the sub-corpora, because the accuracy of the estimatesof hits and misses will depend upon the propor tion of errors in each sub-corpus as well as on the sample sizes.</S>
			<S sid="204" ssid="67">The OK sub-corpus is expected to have even fewer errors than the overall base rate, so it is especially important to have a relativelylarge sample from this sub-corpus.</S>
			<S sid="205" ssid="68">The compari son study described above used an OK sub-corpussample that was twice as large as the Error subcorpus sample (about 500 contexts vs. 250 con texts).</S>
			<S sid="206" ssid="69">In short, the sampling approach is intended to alleviate the burden on annotators when faced with the task of having to rate several thousand errors of a particular type in order to produce a sizeable error corpus.</S>
			<S sid="207" ssid="70">On the other hand, one advantage that exhaustive annotation has over the sampling method is that it makes possible the comparison of multiple systems.</S>
			<S sid="208" ssid="71">With the sampling approach, one would have to resample and annotate for each system, thus multiplying the work needed.</S>

	<SECTION title="Analysis of Learner Errors. " number="5">
			<S sid="209" ssid="1">One aspect of automatic error detection that usu ally is under-reported is an analysis of the errors that learners typically make.</S>
			<S sid="210" ssid="2">The obvious benefit of this analysis is that it can focus development of the system.</S>
			<S sid="211" ssid="3">From our annotated set of preposition errors, we found that the most common prepositions that learners used incorrectly were in (21.4%), to (20.8%) and of (16.6%).</S>
			<S sid="212" ssid="4">The top ten prepositions accounted for 93.8% of all preposition errors in our learner corpus.Next, we ranked the common preposition ?con fusions?, the common mistakes made for each preposition.</S>
			<S sid="213" ssid="5">The top ten most common confusions are listed in Table 5, where null refers to cases where no preposition is licensed (the writer usedan extraneous preposition).</S>
			<S sid="214" ssid="6">The most common of fenses were actually extraneous errors (see Table5): using to and of when no preposition was li censed accounted for 16.8% of all errors.</S>
			<S sid="215" ssid="7">It is interesting to note that the most common usage errors by learners overwhelmingly involved the ten most frequently occurring prepositions in native text.</S>
			<S sid="216" ssid="8">This suggests that our effort to handle the 34 most frequently occurring prepositions maybe overextended and that a system that is specifically trained and refined on the top ten preposi tions may provide better diagnostic feedback to a learner.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusions. " number="6">
			<S sid="217" ssid="1">This paper has two contributions to the field of error detection in non-native writing.</S>
			<S sid="218" ssid="2">First, we discussed a system that detects preposition errors with high precison (up to 84%) and is competitive 871 Writer?s Prep.</S>
			<S sid="219" ssid="3">Rater?s Prep.</S>
			<S sid="220" ssid="4">Frequency to null 9.5% of null 7.3% in at 7.1% to for 4.6% in null 3.2% of for 3.1% in on 3.1% of in 2.9% at in 2.7% for to 2.5% Table 5: Common Preposition Confusions with other leading methods.</S>
			<S sid="221" ssid="5">We used an ME approach augmented with combination features and a series of thresholds.</S>
			<S sid="222" ssid="6">This system is currently incorporated in the Criterion writing evaluationservice.</S>
			<S sid="223" ssid="7">Second, we showed that the standard ap proach to evaluating NLP error detection systems (comparing a system?s output with a gold-standard annotation) can greatly skew system results when the annotation is done by only one rater.</S>
			<S sid="224" ssid="8">However, one reason why a single rater is commonly used is that building a corpus of learner errors can be extremely costly and time consuming.</S>
			<S sid="225" ssid="9">To address this efficiency issue, we presented a sampling approach that produces results comparable to exhaustive annotation.</S>
			<S sid="226" ssid="10">This makes using multiple raters possible since less time is required to assess the system?s performance.</S>
			<S sid="227" ssid="11">While the work presented here has focused on prepositions, the arguments against using only one rater, and for using a sampling approach generalize to other error types, such as determiners and collocations.</S>
			<S sid="228" ssid="12">Acknowledgements We would first like to thank our two annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverly VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.</S>
			<S sid="229" ssid="13">We wouldalso like to acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers and Derrick Higgins for their helpful com ments and feedback.</S>
