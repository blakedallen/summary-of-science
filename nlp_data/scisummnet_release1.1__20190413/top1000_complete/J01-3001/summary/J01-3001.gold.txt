The Interaction Of Knowledge Sources In Word Sense Disambiguation
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a computational linguistics task likely to benefit from the tradition of combining different knowledge sources in artificial intelligence research.
An important step in the exploration of this hypothesis is to determine which linguistic knowledge sources are most useful and whether their combination leads to improved results.
We present a sense tagger which uses several knowledge sources.
Tested accuracy exceeds 94% on our evaluation corpus
Our system attempts to disambiguate all content words in running text rather than limiting itself to treating a restricted vocabulary of words.
It is argued that this approach is more likely to assist the creation of practical systems.
We present a classifier combination framework where disambiguation methods (simulated annealing, subject codes and selectional restrictions) were combined using the TiMBL memory-based approach (Daelemans et al, 1999).
We use Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) as sense inventory.
We use POS tags of the focus word itself to aid sense disambiguations related to syntactic differences.
We suggest that use of both syntactic and lexical features will improve disambiguation accuracies.
