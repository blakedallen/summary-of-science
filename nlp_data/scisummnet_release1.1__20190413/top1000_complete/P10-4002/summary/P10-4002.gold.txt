cdec: A Decoder Alignment and Learning Framework for Finite-State and Context-Free Translation Models
We present cdec, an open source framework for decoding, aligning with, and training a number of statistical machine translation models, including word-based models, phrase-based models, and models based on synchronous context-free grammars.
Using a single unified internal representation for translation forests, the decoder strictly separates model-specific translation logic from general rescoring, pruning, and inference algorithms.
From this unified representation, the decoder can extract not only the 1- or k-best translations, but also alignments to a reference, or the quantities necessary to drive discriminative training using gradient-based or gradient-free optimization techniques.
Its efficient C++ implementation means that memory use and runtime performance are significantly better than comparable decoders.
We present cdec, a fast implementation of hierarchical phrase-based translation models (Chiang, 2005), which represents a state-of-the-art translation system.
Our cdec decoder learns word segmentation lattices from raw text in an unsupervised manner.
