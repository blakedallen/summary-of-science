An Efficient Method For Determining Bilingual Word Classes
In statistical natural language processing we always face the problem of sparse data.
One way to reduce this problem is to group words into equivalence classes which is a standard method in statistical language modeling.
In this paper we describe a method to determine bilingual word classes suitable for statistical machine translation.
We develop an optimization criterion based on a maximum-likelihood approach and describe a clustering algorithm.
We will show that the usage of the bilingual word classes we get can improve statistical machine translation.
We show improvements on perplexity of bilingual corpus, and word translation accuracy using a template-based translation model.
We describe a method for determining bilingual word classes, used to improve the extraction of alignment templates through alignments between classes, not only between words.
