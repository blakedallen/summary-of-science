  <S sid="1" ssid="1">This paper presents an automatic scheme for collecting statistics on cooc- currence patterns in a large corpus.</S>
  <S sid="2" ssid="2">To a large ex- tent, these statistics reflect, semantic onstraints and thus are used to disambiguate anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities.</S>
  <S sid="3" ssid="3">The scherne was imple- mented by gathering statistics on the output of other linguistic tools.</S>
  <S sid="4" ssid="4">An experiment was performed to resolve references of the pronoun "it" in sentences that were randomly selected from the corpus.</S>
  <S sid="5" ssid="5">Ttle results of the experiment show that in most of the cases the cooccurrence statistics indeed reflect the semantic onstraints and thus provide a basis {or a useful disambiguat.ion tool.</S>
  <S sid="6" ssid="6">1 Introduct ion The use of selectional constraints i one of the most popular methods in applying semantic information to the resolution of ambiguities in natural anguages.</S>
  <S sid="7" ssid="7">The constraints typically specify which combina- tions of semantic lasses are acceptable in subject- verb-object relationships and other syntactic struc- tures.</S>
  <S sid="8" ssid="8">This information is used to filter ont some analyses of ambiguous constructs or to set prefer- ences between alternatives.</S>
  <S sid="9" ssid="9">Though the use of selectional constraints i very popular, there is very little success (if any) in im- plementing this method for broad domains.</S>
  <S sid="10" ssid="10">The major problem is the huge amount of information that must be acquired in order to achieve a rea- sonable representation of a large domain.</S>
  <S sid="11" ssid="11">In order to overcome this problem, our project suggests an alternative to the traditional model, based on auto- matic acquisition of constraints flom a large corpus.</S>
  <S sid="12" ssid="12">The rest of the paper describes how this method is used to resolve anaphora references.</S>
  <S sid="13" ssid="13">Similarly, the constraints are used also to resolve syntactic am- biguities, but this will not be described here.</S>
  <S sid="14" ssid="14">The *Part of this resemch was conducted wb.ile visiting IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Ileights, NY reader should bare in mind that like the conven- tional use of selectional constraints, our method is inteuded to work in co,tjunction with other disam- biguation means.</S>
  <S sid="15" ssid="15">These, such as various syntactic and pragmatic onstraints and heuristics [Carbonetl and Brown P.)88, tlobbs 1978], represent additional levels of knowledge and are essential when selec- tional constraints are not sufficient.</S>
  <S sid="16" ssid="16">2 The Statist ical  Approach According to the statistical model, cooccurrence patterns that were observed in tile corpns are used as selection patterns.</S>
  <S sid="17" ssid="17">Whenever several alternatives are presented by an ambiguous construct, we prefer the one correspot~ding t.omore frequent patterns.</S>
  <S sid="18" ssid="18">When using selectional constraints for anaphora resolution, the referent must satisfy the constraints which are imposed on the anaphor.</S>
  <S sid="19" ssid="19">If the anaphor participates in a certain syntactic relation, like be- ing an object of some verb, then the substitution of the anaphor with the referent must satisfy the selectional constraim.s.</S>
  <S sid="20" ssid="20">In the statistical model, we substitute ach of the candidt~tes with the anaphor and approve only those candidates which produce frequent cooccurrence patterns.</S>
  <S sid="21" ssid="21">Consider, for exam- pie, the following sentence, taken from the Hansard corpus of the proceedings of the Canadian parlia- ment [Brown et al.</S>
  <S sid="22" ssid="22">1988]: (1) They know full well that the companies held tax money aside for collection later on the b~sis that the government said it was going to collect it.</S>
  <S sid="23" ssid="23">There are two occurrences of "it" in this sentence.</S>
  <S sid="24" ssid="24">The first serves ~ the subject of "collect" and the second as its object.</S>
  <S sid="25" ssid="25">We gathered the statistics for three candidates which occur in the sentence: "col- lection", "money" and "government".</S>
  <S sid="26" ssid="26">According to the syntactic structure of the sentence, each of them may serw~ aL, s the referent for each of the occurrences of the pronoun.</S>
  <S sid="27" ssid="27">The following table lists the pat- terns that were produced by substituting each can- 330 1 didate with the anaphor, and the number of times each of these patterns occurred in the corpus: subject-verb collection collect 0 subject-verb money collect S subject-verb government collect 198 verb -ob jec t  collect collection 0 verb.-obj ect  collect money 149 verb-~object collect government 0 According to these statistics "government" is pre- ferred as the reti~rent of the first "it", and "money" of the second.</S>
  <S sid="28" ssid="28">This example demonstrates the case of definite se.- mantle constraints which eliminate all but the cor- rect alternative.</S>
  <S sid="29" ssid="29">In other cases, several alternatives may ,;atisfy the selectional constraints, and may be observed in the corpus a significant number of times.</S>
  <S sid="30" ssid="30">In such cases the tlnal selection between the ap- proved candidates hould be performed by other means, such as syntactic heuristics or asking the user.</S>
  <S sid="31" ssid="31">Another passibility may be to use statistical preferences, and prefer the relatively more frequent patterns, tlowever, at this stage it is not clear to us how useflfl the statistical preference can be, and we use the statistics only relative to a certain threshold, approving any patterns that pass this threshold.</S>
  <S sid="32" ssid="32">3 Implementing the Acquisi- tion Phase The use of the statistical model involves two sepa- rate phases.</S>
  <S sid="33" ssid="33">The first is the acquisition pha.se, in which the corpus is processed and the statistical database is built.</S>
  <S sid="34" ssid="34">The second is the disambigua- tion phase, in which the statistical datab~Lse is used to resolve ambiguities.</S>
  <S sid="35" ssid="35">The statistical database contains cooccurrence patterns for various syntactic relations.</S>
  <S sid="36" ssid="36">In the ex- periment reported here we have used constraints for the %ubject-verb", "verb-object" and "adjective- noun" relations.</S>
  <S sid="37" ssid="37">To locate these relations in the sentences of the corpus, each sentence is parsed by the PEG parser [Jensen 1986].</S>
  <S sid="38" ssid="38">Then, a post- processing algorithm identifies the various relations in the parse tree.</S>
  <S sid="39" ssid="39">As wa.s noted in [Grishman et al.</S>
  <S sid="40" ssid="40">1986], the cooccurrence patterns reflect regu- larized or canonical structure.</S>
  <S sid="41" ssid="41">Therefore the post- processing algorithm has to map surface structures into the normalized relations.</S>
  <S sid="42" ssid="42">During our experi- ments we have used two different implementations for this algorithm [Lappin et al.</S>
  <S sid="43" ssid="43">1988] [Jensen 1989], which take into account structures like passives, sub- clauses, questions and relative and infinitive clauses.</S>
  <S sid="44" ssid="44">The use of an automatic procedure for extracting information from a corpus that was not preprocessed manually raises a basic problem of circularity.</S>
  <S sid="45" ssid="45">Since the corpus was not disambiguated, it is not possible to distinguish the semantically correct patterns from the incorrect ones.</S>
  <S sid="46" ssid="46">Both types of ambiguity, syntac- tic and lexical, may cause the system to acquire or use inappropriate patterns.</S>
  <S sid="47" ssid="47">This problems is consid~ ered very important when dealing with a corpus: it was the re,Leon for the substantial human interven- tion in the procedure of [Grishman et al.</S>
  <S sid="48" ssid="48">1986], and it is the reason why other techniques use manually tagged corpora (e.g.</S>
  <S sid="49" ssid="49">[Church 1988]).</S>
  <S sid="50" ssid="50">In practice, however, we have discovered that the problem is not so cruciah semantically vMid pat- terns have occurred many more times in syntac- tically unambiguous constructs than in mnbiguous ones.</S>
  <S sid="51" ssid="51">Thus, they could be identified without the need of first disambiguating the sentences.</S>
  <S sid="52" ssid="52">Seman- tically non-valid patterns indeed occurred in the in- appropriate parses but they were too rare to pass the threshold.</S>
  <S sid="53" ssid="53">As tbr lcxical ambiguities, the chance that one sense of a word will be confused with an- other during disambiguation seems to be very small, and it never happened in our experiment.</S>
  <S sid="54" ssid="54">4 The Experiment An experiment was performed to resolve references of the anaphor "it" in the IIansard corpus.</S>
  <S sid="55" ssid="55">The examples of the ambiguous entences were selected in tile following way: First, sentences containing the word "it" were extracted randomly from the corpus.</S>
  <S sid="56" ssid="56">Then, we manually filtered out sentences that were not relevant for the use of selectional constraints in resolving anaphoric references.</S>
  <S sid="57" ssid="57">Such cases were non- anaphoric occurrences of "it", cases where the ref- erent was not a noun phrase and cases where the anaphor was not involved in one of the three rela- tions that we used.</S>
  <S sid="58" ssid="58">In addition, we have excluded cases where there was only one possible referent, so that our results will reflect correctly the perfor~ mance of the disambiguation method.</S>
  <S sid="59" ssid="59">The filtering process eliminated about two t.hirds of the original sentences, and we proceeded with 59 examples.</S>
  <S sid="60" ssid="60">The alternative candidates for the referent (which satisfy definite syntactic constrair, ts such as number, gen- der and requirements for reflexives) were identified manually in each example.</S>
  <S sid="61" ssid="61">1 The statistics were collected from part o[ the cor- pus, of about 28 million words.</S>
  <S sid="62" ssid="62">For 21 out of the 59 examples the statistics were not meaningful (we used a threshold of 5 occurrences for each of the alterna- tive patterns).</S>
  <S sid="63" ssid="63">In these cases the algorithm cannot approve any of the candidates, getting a "coverage" of 38/59 (64%).</S>
  <S sid="64" ssid="64">As explained in Section 2, the output of the sta- tistical method is used to represent the selectional 1 The l lansard corpus, as maintained by the speech g]oup at IBM Watson Research Center, does not contain consec- utive sentences.</S>
  <S sid="65" ssid="65">Therefore, we identified only candidaLes within the same sentence as the anaphor.</S>
  <S sid="66" ssid="66">"Io provide enough candidales, we examined occurrences of "it" ~ffter the 15th word of the senLence.</S>
  <S sid="67" ssid="67">The examples provided between 2 to 5 candidates, with an average of 2,8 candidates per anaphor.</S>
  <S sid="68" ssid="68">2 331 constraints.</S>
  <S sid="69" ssid="69">This is done by approving all pat- terns which appeared a significant nunaber of times.</S>
  <S sid="70" ssid="70">Therefore, the output is considered correct if the appropriate candidate is approved.</S>
  <S sid="71" ssid="71">This happened in 33 cases, getting "accuracy" of 33/38 (87%).</S>
  <S sid="72" ssid="72">In 18 of these cases, the appropriate candidate was the only one which was approved, getting a complete resolution of the ambiguity.</S>
  <S sid="73" ssid="73">This last result demonstrates the advantage of the statistical data over semantic onstraints.</S>
  <S sid="74" ssid="74">While se- mantic constraints should approve any combination of arguments in a syntactic relation that may oc- cur in the text, the statistics approve only those combinations that actually occur and reject others.</S>
  <S sid="75" ssid="75">Manual observation of the 18 sentences in which the statistics completely resolved the ambiguity showed that only in 7 cases the ambiguity could be elim- inated by traditional selectional constraints.</S>
  <S sid="76" ssid="76">This is consistent with the evaluation in [Itobbs 1978], where only in 12 out of 132 sentences the ambiguity was eliminated by selectional constraints.</S>
  <S sid="77" ssid="77">An additional note should be made concerning the technical methodology of the experiment.</S>
  <S sid="78" ssid="78">Within the limited resources of our research, it was not fea- sible to build the statistical database for the entire Itansard corpus, which contains about 60 million words.</S>
  <S sid="79" ssid="79">The expensive resources are the parsing time and the storage for the cooceurrence patterns and their statistics.</S>
  <S sid="80" ssid="80">~ However, it turns out that pars- ing the entire corpus is not necessary to evaluate the success of the statistical model!</S>
  <S sid="81" ssid="81">As the evalu- ation relates to a limited number of examples, it is sufficient o collect the statistics only for patterns that are relevant for the disambiguation of these ex- amples.</S>
  <S sid="82" ssid="82">Therefore, we have extracted from the cor- pus only those sentences that contained at least one cooccurrenee of words from a relevant pattern.</S>
  <S sid="83" ssid="83">This procedure allowed us to parse only 10,000 sentences.</S>
  <S sid="84" ssid="84">5 Conclusions We have suggested using cooccurrence patterns, au- tomatically acquired from a large corpus, as an alter- native to selectional constraints.</S>
  <S sid="85" ssid="85">The initial results indicate that even in its basic form, as presented here, the approach is useful for disambiguation, and many times performs even better than the tradi- tional model.</S>
  <S sid="86" ssid="86">This should be considered relative to the effort that would have been required to achieve such coverage and accuracy by manual acquisition of constraints, for the broad domain of parliament proceedings.</S>
  <S sid="87" ssid="87">SAlthough the constnlction of the full size database is not feasible for us, it is clearly feasible for a large scale project.</S>
  <S sid="88" ssid="88">This is shown by a similar database that w~s implemented as part of the laslgllage model of the IBM speech recognition system.</S>
  <S sid="89" ssid="89">3?his database contalns counters for occurrences of sequences of three words in lmge corpora (trigrams), which arc much more numerous than our syntactic patterns.</S>
  <S sid="90" ssid="90">In a general perspective, this project promotes the use of a large corpus for linguistic research and ap- plications.</S>
  <S sid="91" ssid="91">Processing such large corpora is a non- trivial engineering problem, the solution of which enables research to focus on complicated real world sentences.</S>
  <S sid="92" ssid="92">Our research demonstrates how statisti- cal methods can be built on top of more traditional linguistic tools, achieving a better and more feasible environment for the resolution of ambiguities.</S>
