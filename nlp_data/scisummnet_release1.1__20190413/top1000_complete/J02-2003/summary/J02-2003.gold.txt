Class-Based Probability Estimation Using A Semantic Hierarchy
This article concerns the estimation of a particular kind of probability, namely, the probability of a noun sense appearing as a particular argument of a predicate.
In order to overcome the accompanying sparse-data problem, the proposal here is to define the probabilities in terms of senses from a semantic hierarchy and exploit the fact that the senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses.
There is a particular focus on the problem of how to determine a suitable class for a given sense, or, alternatively, how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.
A procedure is developed that uses a chi-square test to determine a suitable level of generalization.
In order to test the performance of the estimation method, a pseudo-disambiguation task is used, together with two alternative estimation methods.
Each method uses a different generalization procedure; the first alternative uses the minimum description length principle, and the second uses Resnikâ€™s measure of selectional preference.
In addition, the performance of our method is investigated using both the standard Pearson chisquare statistic and the log-likelihood chi-square statistic.
Briefly, we populate the WordNet hierarchy based on corpus frequencies (of all nouns for a verb/slot pair), and then determine the appropriate probability estimate at each node in the hierarchy by using chi square to determine whether to generalize an estimate to a parent node in the hierarchy.
