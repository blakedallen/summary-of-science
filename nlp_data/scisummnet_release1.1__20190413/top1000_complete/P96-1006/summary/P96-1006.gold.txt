Integrating Multiple Knowledge Sources To Disambiguate Word Sense: An Exemplar-Based Approach
In this paper, we present a new approach for word sense disambiguation (WSD) using an exemplar-based learning algorithm.
This approach integrates a diverse set of knowledge sources to disambiguate word sense, including part of speech of neighboring words, morphological form, the unordered set of surrounding words, local collocations, and verb-object syntactic relation.
We tested our WSD program, named LEXAS, on both a common data set used in previous work, as well as on a large sense-tagged corpus that we separately constructed.
LEXAS achieves a higher accuracy on the common data set, and performs better than the most frequent heuristic on the highly ambiguous words in the large corpus tagged with the refined senses of WoRDNET.
We obtain an overall accuracy for the noun interest of 87% and find that when our feature sets consists only of co-occurrence features the accuracy only drops to 80%.
We conclude taht collocational information is more important than syntactic information to WSD.
Our DSO corpus focuses on 191 frequent and polysemous words (nouns and verbs) and contains around 1,000 sentences per words.
