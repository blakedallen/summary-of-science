PARADISE: A Framework For Evaluating Spoken Dialogue Agents
This paper presents PARADISE (PARAdigm for Dialogue System Evaluation), a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents.
The framework decouples task requirements from an agent's dialogue behaviors, supports comparisons among dialogue strategies, enables the calculation of performance over subdialogues and whole dialogues, specifies the relative contribution of various factors to performance, and makes it possible to compare agents performing different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.
We identify three factors which carry an influence on the performance of SDSs: agent factors (mainly related to the dialogue and the system itself), task factors (related to how the SDS captures the task it has been developed for) and environmental factor (e.g. factors related to the acoustic environment and the transmission channel.
We aim to evaluate diaglogue agent strategies by relating overall user satisfaction to other metrics such as task success, efficiency measure and qualitative measures.
