Text Chunking Using Transformation-Based Learning
Eric Brill introduced transformation-based learning and showed that it can do part-of-speech tagging with fairly high accuracy.
The same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive "baseNP" chunks.
For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word.
In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 92% for baseNP chunks and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence.
Some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach are also suggested by this application.
We formalize chunking as a classification task, in which each word is classified as the (B)eginning, (I)nside or (O) outside of a chunk.
We pioneer the machine learning techniques to chunking problem.
