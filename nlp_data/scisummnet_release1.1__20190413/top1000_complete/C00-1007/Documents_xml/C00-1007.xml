  <S sid="1" ssid="1">com Abst ract Previous stochastic approaches to generation do not include a tree-based representation of syntax.</S>
  <S sid="2" ssid="2">While this may be adequate or even advantageous for some applications, other ap- plications profit from using as much syntactic knowledge as is available, leaving to a stochas- tic model only those issues that are not deter- mined by the grammar.</S>
  <S sid="3" ssid="3">We present initial re- suits showing that a tree-based model derived from a tree-annotated corpus improves on a tree model derived from an unannotated corpus, and that a tree-based stochastic model with a hand- crafted grammar outpertbrms both.</S>
  <S sid="4" ssid="4">1 I n t roduct ion For many apt)lications in natural anguage gen~ eration (NLG), the range of linguistic expres- sions that must be generated is quite restricted, and a grammar tbr generation can be fltlly spec- ified by hand.</S>
  <S sid="5" ssid="5">Moreover, in ma W cases it; is very important not to deviate from certain linguis- tic standards in generation, in which case hand- crafted grammars give excellent control.</S>
  <S sid="6" ssid="6">How- ever, in other applications tbr NLG the variety of the output is much bigger, and the demands on the quality of the output somewhat less strin- gent.</S>
  <S sid="7" ssid="7">A typical example is NLG in the con- text of (interlingua- or transthr-based) machine translation.</S>
  <S sid="8" ssid="8">Another reason for reb~xing the quality of the output may be that not enough time is available to develop a flfll grammar tbr a new target language in NLG.</S>
  <S sid="9" ssid="9">In all these cases, stochastic ("empiricist") methods pro- vide an alternative to hand-crafted ("rational- ist") approaches to NLG.</S>
  <S sid="10" ssid="10">To our knowledge, the first to use stochastic techniques in NLG were Langkilde and Knight (1998a) and (1998b).</S>
  <S sid="11" ssid="11">In this paper, we present FERGUS (Flexible Em- piricist/Rationalist Generation Using Syntax).</S>
  <S sid="12" ssid="12">FErtGUS follows Langkilde and Knights seminal work in using an n-gram language model, but; we augment it with a tree-based stochastic model and a traditional tree-based syntactic grammar.</S>
  <S sid="13" ssid="13">More recent work on aspects of stochastic gen- eration include (Langkilde and Knight, 2000), (Malouf, 1999) and (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).</S>
  <S sid="14" ssid="14">Betbre we describe in more detail how we use stochastic models in NLG, we recall the basic tasks in NLG (Rainbow and Korelsky, 1992; Re- iter, 1994).</S>
  <S sid="15" ssid="15">During text  p lanning,  content and structure of the target text; are determined to achieve the overall communicative goal.</S>
  <S sid="16" ssid="16">Dur- ing sentence planning, linguistic means - in particular, lexical and syntactic means are de- termined to convey smaller pieces of meaning.</S>
  <S sid="17" ssid="17">l)uring real izat ion,  the specification chosen in sentence planning is transtbrmed into a surface string, by line~rizing and intlecting words in the sentence (and typically, adding function words).</S>
  <S sid="18" ssid="18">As in the work by Langkilde and Knight, our work ignores the text planning stage, but it; does address the sentence, planning and the realiza- tion stages.</S>
  <S sid="19" ssid="19">The structure of the paper is as tbllows.</S>
  <S sid="20" ssid="20">In Section 2, we present he underlying rammat- ical tbrmalism, lexicalized tree-adjoining gram- mar (LTAG).</S>
  <S sid="21" ssid="21">In Section 3, we describe the ar- chitecture of the system, and some of the mod- ules.</S>
  <S sid="22" ssid="22">In Section 4 we discuss three experiments.</S>
  <S sid="23" ssid="23">In Section 5 we colnpare our work to that of Langkilde and Knight (1998a).</S>
  <S sid="24" ssid="24">We conclude with a summary of on-going work.</S>
  <S sid="25" ssid="25">2 Modeling Syntax In order to model syntax, we use an existing wide-coverage grammar of English, the XTAG grammar developed at the University of Peru&gt; sylvania (XTAG-Gronp, 1999).</S>
  <S sid="26" ssid="26">XTAG is a tree~ adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi, 1987a).</S>

  <S sid="31" ssid="31">In linguisI;ic uses (}f TAG, we asso{ial;e one lexical item (its anchor) with each tree, and {}he or (typically) more trees with each lexical ire]n; its a result we obtain a lexi- calized TAG or LTAG.</S>
  <S sid="32" ssid="32">Since ea{h lexi{:al item is associated with a whole tree (rather than just a phrase-stru{ture ule, tbr exa]nl)le), we cm] st)e(:i[y t}oth the t)re{licate-argument struc- ture of the lexeme (t}y includillg nodes at which its arguments must sut}stitute) and morl)h{}- syntactic onstraints uch as sut}je(t-verb agree- men| within the sl;rucl;ure associated with the l exeme.</S>
  <S sid="33" ssid="33">This property is retbrred to as TAGs cztcndcd domain of locality.</S>
  <S sid="34" ssid="34">N{)l;e that in an LTAG, I;here is no distinction betw{:en lexicon nnd grammar.</S>
  <S sid="35" ssid="35">A Smnl)le grammar is shown in F igure  1.</S>
  <S sid="36" ssid="36">-We depart fl:om XTAG in our treatment of |;rees tbr adjuncts (such as adverl}s), an{t in- stead tbllow McDonMd and Pusteiovsky (1985).</S>

  <S sid="38" ssid="38">This ilflormal;ion is kept in the  adjunct|on table which is associated with the.</S>
  <S sid="39" ssid="39">grammar; an excerpt is shown in Figure 2.</S>
  <S sid="40" ssid="40">Trees t;hat can adjoin to other trees (and have entries in the adjunct|on table) ;~re called gamma-trees, the other trees (which can only t)e substituted into other trees) are alpha-trees.</S>
  <S sid="41" ssid="41">Note that we can refer to a tree by a combi- nation of its name, called its supertag, and its anchor.</S>
  <S sid="42" ssid="42">N)r example, (q is the supertag of an all)ha-tree anchored 1)y a noun that projects up to NP, wMle 72 is |;lie superi;ag of it gamma tree anchored by a noun that only t)rojects 1;{) N (we 43 assume adjectives are adjoined at N), and, as the adjunction table shows, can right-adjoin to an N. So that es t imate~ is a particular tree in our LTAG grammar.</S>
  <S sid="43" ssid="43">Another tree that a su- pertag can be associated with is ~t~, which rep- resents the predicative use of a noun.1 Not all nouns are associated with all nominal supertags: the expletive there is only an cq.</S>
  <S sid="44" ssid="44">When we derive a sentence using an LTAG, we combine elementary trees flom the grmnmar using adjunction and substitution.</S>
  <S sid="45" ssid="45">For extort- pie, to derive the sentence There was no cost estimate for the second phase from the gram- mar in Figure 1, we substitute the tree tbr there into the tree tbr estimate.</S>
  <S sid="46" ssid="46">We then adjoin in the trees tbr the auxiliary was, the determiner no, and the modit)ing noun cost.</S>
  <S sid="47" ssid="47">Note that these adjunctions occur at different nodes: at VP, NP~ and N, respectively.</S>
  <S sid="48" ssid="48">We then adjoin in the preposition, into which we substitute ph, ase, into which we adjoin the and second.</S>
  <S sid="49" ssid="49">Note that all adjunctions are by gamma trees, and all sub- stitution by alpha trees.</S>
  <S sid="50" ssid="50">If we want to represent this derivation graphi- cally, we can do so in a derivation tree, which we obtain as follows: whelmver we adjoin or sub- stitute a tree t~ into a tree t2, we add a new daughter labeled t~ to the node labeled tg.</S>
  <S sid="51" ssid="51">As explained above, the name of each tree used is the lexeme along with the supertag.</S>
  <S sid="52" ssid="52">(We omit the address at which substitution or adjunction takes place.)</S>
  <S sid="53" ssid="53">The derivation tree t br our deriva- tion is shown in Figure 3.</S>
  <S sid="54" ssid="54">As can be seen, this structure is a dependency tree and resembles a representation of lexical argument structure.</S>
  <S sid="55" ssid="55">aoshi (1987b) claims that TAGs properties make it particularly suited as a syntactic rep- resentation tbr generation.</S>
  <S sid="56" ssid="56">Specifically, its ex- tended domain of locality is useflfl in genera- tion tbr localizing syntactic properties (includ- ing word order as well as agreement and other morphological processes), and lexicalization is useful tbr providing an interfime from seman- tics (the deriw~tion tree represent the sentences predicate-argument structure).</S>
  <S sid="57" ssid="57">Indeed, LTAG has been used extensively in generation, start- ing with (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985).</S>
  <S sid="58" ssid="58">1Sentences such as Peter is a doctor can be analyzed with with be as the head, as is more usual, or with doctor as the head, as is done in XTAG 1)eeause the be really behaves like an auxiliary, not like a flfll verb.</S>

  <S sid="60" ssid="60">The input to the system is a dependency tree as shown in Figme 4.</S>
  <S sid="61" ssid="61">Note that the nodes are labeled only with lexemes, not with supertags.</S>
  <S sid="62" ssid="62">2 The Tree Chooser then uses a stochastic tree model to choose TAG trees fbr the nodes in the input structure.</S>
  <S sid="63" ssid="63">This step can be seen as analogous to "supertag- ging" (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), except that now supertags (i.e., names of trees) must be fbund tbr words in a tree rather than tbr words in a linear sequence.</S>
  <S sid="64" ssid="64">The Unraveler then uses the XTAG grammar to produce a lattice of all possible linearizations that arc compatible with the supertagged tree and the XTAG.</S>
  <S sid="65" ssid="65">The LP Chooser then chooses the most likely traversal of this lattice, given a language model.</S>
  <S sid="66" ssid="66">We dis- cuss the three components in more detail.</S>
  <S sid="67" ssid="67">The Tree Chooser draws on a tree model, which is a representation of XTAG derivation tbr 1,000,000 words of the Wall Street Journal.</S>

  <S sid="69" ssid="69">This is of course unrealistic for applications.</S>
  <S sid="70" ssid="70">In this paper, we only aim to show that the use of a %ee Model improves performance of a stochastic generator.</S>

  <S sid="152" ssid="152">Specifically, we will add a morphological compo- nent, a component that handles flmction words (auxiliaries, determiners), and a component that handles imnctuation.</S>
  <S sid="153" ssid="153">In all three cases, we will provide both knowledge-based and stochas- tic components, with the aim of comparing their behaviors, and using one type as a back-up tbr the other type.</S>
  <S sid="154" ssid="154">Finally, we will explore FI;R- OUS when applied to a language tbr which a much more limited XTAG grammar is available (for example, specit[ying only the basic sentence word order as, sw, SVO, and speci(ying subject- verb agreement).</S>
  <S sid="155" ssid="155">In the long run, we intend FEI/OUS to become a flexible system which will use hand-crafted knowledge as much as possible and stochastic models as much as necessary.</S>
