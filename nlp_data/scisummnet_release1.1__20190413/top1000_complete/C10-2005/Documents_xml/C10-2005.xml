	<SECTION title="Introduction" number="1">
			<S sid="5" ssid="5">Twitter is one of the most popular social network websites and has been growing at a very fast pace.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">The number of Twitter users reached an estimated75 million by the end of 2009, up from approx imately 5 million in the previous year.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Through the twitter platform, users share either informationor opinions about personalities, politicians, prod ucts, companies, events (Prentice and Huffman, 2008) etc. This has been attracting the attention of different communities interested in analyzing its content.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">Sentiment detection of tweets is one of the basicanalysis utility functions needed by various applications over twitter data.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">Many systems and ap proaches have been implemented to automatically detect sentiment on texts (e.g., news articles, Web reviews and Web blogs) (Pang et al, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Glance et al, 2005; Wilson et al, 2005).</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Most of theseapproaches use the raw word representation (n grams) as features to build a model for sentiment detection and perform this task over large pieces of texts.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">However, the main limitation of usingthese techniques for the Twitter context is mes sages posted on Twitter, so-called tweets, are veryshort.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">The maximum size of a tweet is 140 char acters.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">In this paper, we propose a 2-step sentiment analysis classification method for Twitter, whichfirst classifies messages as subjective and ob jective, and further distinguishes the subjectivetweets as positive or negative.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">To reduce the la beling effort in creating these classifiers, instead of using manually annotated data to compose thetraining data, as regular supervised learning ap proaches, we leverage sources of noisy labels asour training data.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">These noisy labels were pro vided by a few sentiment detection websites over twitter data.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">To better utilize these sources, we verify the potential value of using and combining them, providing an analysis of the provided labels, examine different strategies of combining these sources in order to obtain the best outcome; and, propose a more robust feature set that captures a more abstract representation of tweets, composedby meta-information associated to words and spe cific characteristics of how tweets are written.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">By using it, we aim to handle better: the problem of lack of information on tweets, helping on thegeneralization process of the classification algo rithms; and the noisy and biased labels provided by those websites.The remainder of this paper is organized as fol lows.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">In Section 2, we provide some context about messages on Twitter and about the websites used as label sources.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">We introduce the features used in the sentiment detection and also provide a deep analysis of the labels generated by those sources in Section 3.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">We examine different strategies of 36 combining these sources and present an extensive experimental evaluation in Section 4.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">Finally, we discuss previous works related to ours in Section 5and conclude in Section 6, where we outline direc tions and future work.</S>

	<SECTION title="Preliminaries. " number="2">
			<S sid="22" ssid="1">In this section, we give some context about Twitter messages and the sources used for our data-driven approach.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="2">Tweets.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="3">The Twitter messages are called tweets.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="4">There are some particular features that can be usedto compose a tweet (Figure 1 illustrates an ex ample): ?RT?</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="5">is an acronym for retweet, which means the tweet was forwarded from a previous post; ?@twUser?</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="6">represents that this message is areply to the user ?twUser?; ?#obama?</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="7">is a tag provided by the user for this message, so-called hash tag; and ?http://bit.ly/9K4n9p?</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="8">is a link to someexternal source.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="9">Tweets are limited to 140 charac ters.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="10">Due to this lack of information in terms of words present in a tweet, we explore some of the tweet features listed above to boost the sentiment detection, as we will show in detail in Section 3.Data Sources.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="11">We collected data from 3 different websites that provide almost real-time sentiment detection for tweets: Twendz, Twitter Sen timent and TweetFeel.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="12">To collect data, we issued a query containing a common stopword ?of?, as we are interested in collecting generic data, and retrieved tweets from these sites for three weeks,archiving the returned tweets along with their sen timent labels.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="13">Table 1 shows more details aboutthese sources.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="14">Two of the websites provide 3 class detection: positive, negative and neutral and one of them just 2-class detection.</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="15">One thing tonote is our crawling process obtained a very dif ferent number of tweets from each website.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="16">Thismight be a result of differences among their sam pling processes of Twitter stream or some kind of filtering process to output.</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="17">For instance, a sitemay only present the tweets it has more confi dence about their sentiment.</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="18">In Section 3, we present a deep analysis of the data provided by these sources, showing if they are useful to build a sentiment classification.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="19">RT @twUser: Obama is the first U.S. president not to have seen a new state added in his lifetime.</S>

	<SECTION title="Twitter Sentiment Detection. " number="3">
			<S sid="42" ssid="1">Our goal is to categorize a tweet into one of the three sentiment categories: positive, neutral ornegative.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="2">Similar to (Pang and Lee, 2004; Wil son et al, 2005), we implement a 2-step sentimentdetection framework.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="3">The first step targets on dis tinguishing subjective tweets from non-subjective tweets (subjectivity detection).</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="4">The second onefurther classifies the subjective tweets into posi tive and negative, namely, the polarity detection.Both classifiers perform prediction using an ab stract representation of the sentences as features, as we show later in this section.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="5">3.1 Features.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="6">A variety of features have been exploited on the problem of sentiment detection (Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al, 2002; Wiebe et al, 1999; Wiebeand Riloff, 2005; Riloff et al, 2006) including unigrams, bigrams, part-of-speech tags etc. A natural choice would be to use the raw word represen tation (n-grams) as features, since they obtained good results in previous works (Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al, 2002) that deal with large texts.However, as we want to perform sentiment detection on very short messages (tweets), this strategy might not be effective, as shown in our ex periments.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="7">In this context, we are motivated to develop an abstract representation of tweets.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="8">Wepropose the use of two sets of features: metainformation about the words on tweets and char acteristics of how tweets are written.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="9">Meta-features.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="10">Given a word in a tweet, we mapit to its part-of-speech using a part-of-speech dic tionary1.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="11">Previous approaches (Wiebe and Riloff,2005; Riloff et al, 2003) have shown that the ef fectiveness of using POS tags for this task.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="12">Theintuition is certain POS tags are good indicators for sentiment tagging.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="13">For example, opinion messages are more likely containing adjec 1The pos dictionary we used in this paper is available at: http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/pos-readme.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="14">37 Data sources URL # Tweets Sentiments Twendz http://twendz.waggeneredstrom.com/ 254081 pos/neg/neutral Twitter Sentiment http://twittersentiment.appspot.com/ 79696 pos/neg/neutral TweetFeel http://www.tweetfeel.com/ 13122 pos/neg Table 1: Information about the 3 data sources.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="15">tives or interjections.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="16">In addition to POS tags, we map the word to its prior subjectivity (weak and strong subjectivity), also used by (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005), and polarity (positive, negative andneutral).</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="17">The prior polarity is switched from pos itive to negative or vice-versa when a negative expression (as, e.g., ?don?t?, ?never?)</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="18">precedes the word.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="19">We obtained the prior subjectivity and polarity information from subjectivity lexicon of about 8,000 words used in (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003)2.</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="20">Although this is a very comprehensive list, slang and specific Web vocabulary are not present on it, e.g., words as ?yummy?</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="21">or ?ftw?.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="22">For this reason, we collected popular words used on online discussions from many online sources and added them to this list.Tweet Syntax Features.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="23">We exploited the syn tax of the tweets to compose our features.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="24">Theyare: retweet; hashtag; reply; link, if the tweet contains a link; punctuation (exclamation and questions marks); emoticons (textual expression rep resenting facial expressions); and upper cases (the number of words that starts with upper case in the tweet).The frequency of each feature in a tweet is di vided by the number of the words in the tweet.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="25">3.2 Subjectivity Classifier.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="26">As we mentioned before, the first step in our tweet sentiment detection is to predict the subjectivity ofa given tweet.</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="27">We decided to create a single clas sifier by combining the objectivity sentences from Twendz and Twitter Sentiment (objectivity class) and the subjectivity sentences from all 3 sources.As we do not know the quality of the labels pro vided by these sources, we perform a cleaning process over this data to assure some reasonable quality.</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="28">These are the steps: 1.</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="29">Disagreement removal: we remove the.</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="30">2The subjectivity lexicon is available at http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/ tweets that are disagreed between the data sources in terms of subjectivity; 2.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="31">Same user?s messages: we observed that the.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="32">users with the highest number of messages in our dataset are usually those ones that postsome objective messages, for example, ad vertising some product or posting some job recruiting information.</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="33">For this reason, we allowed in the training data only one message from the same user.</S>
			<S sid="75" ssid="34">As we show later, this boosts the classification performance, mainlybecause it removes tweets labeled as subjective by the data sources but are in fact objec tive; 3.</S>
			<S sid="76" ssid="35">Top opinion words: to clean the objective.</S>
			<S sid="77" ssid="36">training set, we remove from this set tweets that contain the top-n opinion words in the subjectivity training set, e.g., words as cool, suck, awesome etc. As we show in Section 4, this process is in fact able to remove certain noisy in the training data,leading to a better performing subjectivity classi fier.</S>
			<S sid="78" ssid="37">To illustrate which of the proposed features are more effective for this task, the top-5 features in terms of information gain, based on our trainingdata, are: positive polarity, link, strong subjec tive, upper case and verbs.</S>
			<S sid="79" ssid="38">Three of them aremeta-information (positive polarity, strong sub jective and verbs) and the other two are tweet syntax features (link and upper case).</S>
			<S sid="80" ssid="39">Here is a typical example of a objective tweet in which the user pointed an external link and used manyupper case words: ?Starbucks Expands Pay-ByIPhone Pilot to 1,000 Stores?Starbucks cus tomers with Apple iPhones or iPod touches can ..</S>
			<S sid="81" ssid="40">http://oohja.com/x9UbC?.</S>
			<S sid="82" ssid="41">38 3.3 Polarity Classifier.</S>
			<S sid="83" ssid="42">The second step of our sentiment detection approach is polarity classification, i.e., predict ing positive or negative sentiment on subjectivetweets.</S>
			<S sid="84" ssid="43">In this section, first we analyze the qual ity of the polarity labels provided by the three sources, and whether their combination has the potential to bring improvement.</S>
			<S sid="85" ssid="44">Second, wepresent some modifications in the proposed fea tures that are more suitable for this task.</S>
			<S sid="86" ssid="45">3.3.1 Analysis of the Data Sources The 3 data sources used in this work provide some kind of polarity labels (see Table 1).</S>
			<S sid="87" ssid="46">Two questions we investigate regarding these sources are: (1) how useful are these polarity labels?</S>
			<S sid="88" ssid="47">and (2) does combining them bring improvement in accuracy?We take the following aspects into considera tion:?</S>
			<S sid="89" ssid="48">Labeler quality: if the labelers have low quality, combine them might not bring much im provement (Sheng et al, 2008).</S>
			<S sid="90" ssid="49">In our case, each source is treated as a labeler; ? Number of labels provided by the labelers:if the labels are informative, i.e., the prob ability of them being correct is higher than 0.5, the more the number of labels, the higher is the performance of a classifier built from them (Sheng et al, 2008); ? Labeler bias: the labeled data provided by the labelers might be only a subset of the real data distribution.</S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="50">For instance, labelers might be interested in only providing labels that they are more confident about;?</S>
			<S sid="92" ssid="51">Different labeler bias: if labelers make simi lar mistakes, the combination of them might not bring much improvement.</S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="52">We provide an empirical analysis of these datasets to address these points.</S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="53">First, we measurethe polarity detection quality of a source by calcu lating the probability p of a label from this source being correct.</S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="54">We use the data manually labeled for assessing the classifiers?</S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="55">performance (testing data, see Section 4) to obtain the correct labels of Data sources Quality Entropy Twendz 0.77 8.3 TwitterSentiment 0.82 7.9 TweetFeel 0.89 7.5 Table 2: Quality of the labels and entropy of thetweets provided by each data source for the polar ity detection.</S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="56">a data sample.</S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="57">Table 2 shows their values.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="58">We can conclude from these numbers that the 3 sources provide a reasonable quality data.</S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="59">This means that combining them might bring some improvement to the polarity detection instead of, for instance, using one of them in isolation.</S>
			<S sid="101" ssid="60">An aspect that is overlooked by quality is the bias of the data.</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="61">For instance, by examining the data from TwitterFeel,we found out that only 4 positive words (?awe some?,?rock?,?love?</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="62">and ?beat?)</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="63">cover 95% of their positive examples and only 6 negative words (?hate?,?suck?,?wtf?,?piss?,?stupid?</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="64">and ?fail?)</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="65">cover 96% of their negative set.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="66">Clearly, the data provided by this source is biased towards thesewords.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="67">This is probably the reason why this website outputs such fewer number of tweets com pared to the other websites (see Table 1) as well as why its data has the smallest entropy among the sources (see Table 2).</S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="68">The quality of the data and its individual bias have certainly impact in the combination of labels.</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="69">However, there is other important aspect that oneneeds to consider: different bias between the labelers.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="70">For instance, if labelers a and b make similar decisions, we expect that combining their labels would not bring much improvement.</S>
			<S sid="112" ssid="71">There fore, the diversity of labelers is a key element incombining them (Polikar, 2006).</S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="72">One way to mea sure this is by calculating the agreement between the labels produced by the labelers.</S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="73">We use the kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) to measure thedegree of agreement between two sources.</S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="74">Ta ble 3 presents the coefficients for each par of data source.</S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="75">All the coefficients are between 0.4 and0.6, which represents a moderate agreement be tween the labelers (Landis and Koch, 1977).</S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="76">This means that in fact the sources provide different bias regarding polarity detection.</S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="77">39 Data sources Kappa Twendz/TwitterSentiment 0.58 TwitterSentiment/TweetFeel 0.58 Twendz/TweetFeel 0.44 Table 3: Kappa coefficient between pairs of sources.From this analysis we can conclude that com bining the labels provided by the 3 sources canimprove the performance of the polarity detection instead of using one of them in isolation be cause they provide diverse labels (moderate kappa agreement) of reasonable quality, although thereis some issues related to bias of the labels pro vided by them.</S>
			<S sid="119" ssid="78">In our experimental evaluation in Section 4, we present results obtained by different strategies of combining these sources that confirm these findings.</S>
			<S sid="120" ssid="79">3.3.2 Polarity Features The features used in the polarity detection are the same ones used in the subjectivity detection.</S>
			<S sid="121" ssid="80">However, as one would expect the set of the most discriminative features is different between the two tasks.</S>
			<S sid="122" ssid="81">For subjectivity detection, the top-5 features in terms of information gain, based on the training data, are: negative polarity, positive polarity, verbs, good emoticons and upper case.</S>
			<S sid="123" ssid="82">For this task, the meta-information of the words (negative polarity, positive polarity and verbs) is more important than specific features from Twitter (good emoticons and upper case), whereas for the subjectivity detection, tweet syntax features have a higher relevance.</S>
			<S sid="124" ssid="83">This analysis show that prior polarity is very important for this task.</S>
			<S sid="125" ssid="84">However, one limitation of using it from a generic list is its values might not hold for some specific scenario.</S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="85">For instance,the polarity of the word ?spot?</S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="86">is positive accord ing to this list.</S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="87">However, looking at our training data almost half of the occurrences of this word appears in the positive set and the other half inthe negative set.</S>
			<S sid="129" ssid="88">Thus, it is not correct to as sume that prior polarity of ?spot?</S>
			<S sid="130" ssid="89">is 1 for thisparticular data.</S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="90">This example illustrates our strat egy to weight the prior polarities: for each wordw with prior polarity defined by the list, we cal culate the prior polarity of w, pol(w), based on the distribution of w in the positive and negative sets.</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="91">Thus, polpos(w) = count(w, pos)/count(w) and polneg(w) = 1?</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="92">polpos(w).</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="93">We assume thepolarity of a word is associated with the polar ity of the sentence, which seems to be reasonable since we are dealing with very short messages.</S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="94">Although simple, this strategy is able to improve the polarity detection, as we show in Section 4.</S>

	<SECTION title="Experiments. " number="4">
			<S sid="136" ssid="1">We have performed an extensive performance evaluation of our solution for twitter sentimentdetection.</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="2">Besides analyzing its overall perfor mance, our goals included: examining different strategies to combine the labels provided by the sources; comparing our approach to previous onesin this area; and evaluating how robust our solu tion is to the noisy and biased data described in Section 3.</S>
			<S sid="138" ssid="3">4.1 Experimental Setup.</S>
			<S sid="139" ssid="4">Data Sets.</S>
			<S sid="140" ssid="5">For the subjectivity detection, afterthe cleansing processing (see Section 3), the train ing data contains about 200,000 tweets (roughly 100,000 tweets were labeled by the sources as subjective ones and 100,000 objective ones), and for polarity detection, 71046 positive and 79628negative tweets.</S>
			<S sid="141" ssid="6">For test data, we manually labeled 1,000 tweets as positive, negative and neu tral.</S>
			<S sid="142" ssid="7">We also built a development set (1,000 tweets) to tune the parameters of the classification algorithms.Approaches.</S>
			<S sid="143" ssid="8">For both tasks, subjectivity and po larity detection, we compared our approach with previous ones reported in the literature.</S>
			<S sid="144" ssid="9">Detailed explanation about them are as follows: ? ReviewSA: this is the approach proposed by Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2004)for sentiment analysis in regular online reviews.</S>
			<S sid="145" ssid="10">It performs the subjectivity detection on a sentence-level relying on the proximity between sentences to detect subjectivity.</S>
			<S sid="146" ssid="11">The set of sentences predicted as subjec tive is then classified as negative or positive in terms of polarity using the unigrams that 40compose the sentences.</S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="12">We used the imple mentation provided by LingPipe (LingPipe, 2008); ? Unigrams: Pang et al (Pang et al, 2002) showed unigrams are effective for sentiment detection in regular reviews.</S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="13">Based on that, we built unigram-based classifiers for the subjectivity and polarity detections over thetraining data.</S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="14">Another approach that uses un igrams is the one used by TwitterSentiment website.</S>
			<S sid="150" ssid="15">For polarity detection, they select the positive examples for the training data from the tweets containing good emoticonsand negative examples from tweets contain ing bad emoticons.</S>
			<S sid="151" ssid="16">(Go et al, 2009).</S>
			<S sid="152" ssid="17">We built a polarity classifier using this approach (Unigrams-TS).</S>
			<S sid="153" ssid="18">TwitterSA: TwitterSA exploits the features described in Section 3 in this paper.</S>
			<S sid="154" ssid="19">Forthe subjectivity detection, we trained a classifier from the two available sources, using the cleaning process described in Sec tion 3 to remove noise in the training data, TwitterSA(cleaning), and other classifiertrained from the original data, TwitterSA(no cleaning).</S>
			<S sid="155" ssid="20">For the polarity detection task, we built a few classifiers to compare theirperformances: TwitterSA(single) and Twit terSA(weights) are two classifiers we trained using combined data from the 3 sources.</S>
			<S sid="156" ssid="21">The only difference is TwitterSA(weights) uses the modification of weighting the priorpolarity of the words based on the training data.</S>
			<S sid="157" ssid="22">TwitterSA(voting) and TwitterSA(maxconf) combine classification out puts from 3 classifiers respectively trained from each source.</S>
			<S sid="158" ssid="23">TwitterSA(voting) usesmajority voting to combine them and TwitterSA(maxconf) picks the one with maxi mum confidence score.We use Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005) to create the classifiers.</S>
			<S sid="159" ssid="24">We tried different learning al gorithms available on Weka and SVM obtainedthe best results for Unigrams and TwitterSA.</S>
			<S sid="160" ssid="25">Experimental results reported in this section are ob tained using SVM.</S>
			<S sid="161" ssid="26">4.2 Subjectivity Detection Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="162" ssid="27">Table 4 shows the error rates obtained by the different subjectivity detection approaches.</S>
			<S sid="163" ssid="28">TwitterSA achieved lower error rate than both Unigrams and ReviewSA.</S>
			<S sid="164" ssid="29">As a result, these numbers confirm that features inferred from meta information of words and specific syntax featuresfrom tweets are better indicators of the subjectivity than unigrams.</S>
			<S sid="165" ssid="30">Another advantage of our approach is since it uses only 20 features, the training and test times are much faster than using thousands of features like Unigrams.</S>
			<S sid="166" ssid="31">One of the reasons why TwitterSA obtained such a good performance was the process of data cleansing (see Sec tion 3).</S>
			<S sid="167" ssid="32">The label quality provided by the sources for this task was very poor: 0.66 for Twendz and 0.68 for TwitterSentiment.</S>
			<S sid="168" ssid="33">By cleaning the data,the error decreased from 19.9, TwitterSA(nocleaning), to 18.1, TwitterSA(cleaning).</S>
			<S sid="169" ssid="34">Regard ing ReviewSA, its lower performance is expected since tweets are composed by single sentences and ReviewSA relies on the proximity between sentences to perform subjectivity detection.</S>
			<S sid="170" ssid="35">We also investigated the influence of the size oftraining data on classification performance.</S>
			<S sid="171" ssid="36">Fig ure 2 plots the error rates obtained by TwitterSAand Unigrams versus the number of training ex amples.</S>
			<S sid="172" ssid="37">The curve corresponding to TwitterSA showed that it achieved good performances evenwith a small training data set, and kept almost constant as more examples were added to the training data, whereas for Unigrams the error rate de creased.</S>
			<S sid="173" ssid="38">For instance, with only 2,000 tweets as training data, TwitterSA obtained 20% of error rate whereas Unigrams 34.5%.</S>
			<S sid="174" ssid="39">These numbers show that our generic representation of tweets produces models that are able to generalize even with a few examples.</S>
			<S sid="175" ssid="40">4.3 Polarity Detection Evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="176" ssid="41">We provide the results for polarity detectionin Table 5.</S>
			<S sid="177" ssid="42">The best performance was ob tained by TwitterSA(maxconf), which combines results of the 3 classifiers, respectively trained from each source, by taking the output by themost confident classifier, as the final prediction.</S>
			<S sid="178" ssid="43">TwitterSA(maxconf) was followed by TwitterSA(weights) and TwitterSA(single), both cre 41 ated from a single training data.</S>
			<S sid="179" ssid="44">This result shows that computing the prior polarity of the words based on the training data TwitterSA(weights)brings some improvement for this task.</S>
			<S sid="180" ssid="45">Twit terSA(voting) obtained the highest error rate among the TwitterSA approaches.</S>
			<S sid="181" ssid="46">This implies that, in our scenario, the best way of combining the merits of the individual classifiers is by using a confidence score approach.Unigrams also achieved comparable perfor mances.</S>
			<S sid="182" ssid="47">However, when reducing the size of thetraining data, the performance gap between Twit terSA and Unigrams is much wider.</S>
			<S sid="183" ssid="48">Figure 3shows the error rate of both approaches3 in function of the training size.</S>
			<S sid="184" ssid="49">Similar to subjectivity detection, the training size does not have much influ ence in the error rate for TwitterSA.</S>
			<S sid="185" ssid="50">However forUnigrams, it decreased significantly as the train ing size increased.</S>
			<S sid="186" ssid="51">For instance, for a training size with 2,000 tweets, the error rate for Unigrams was 46% versus 23.8% for our approach.</S>
			<S sid="187" ssid="52">As forsubjectivity detection, this occurs because our features are in fact able to capture a more general rep resentation of the tweets.Another advantage of TwitterSA over Uni grams is that it produces more robust models.</S>
			<S sid="188" ssid="53">Toillustrate this, we present the error rates of Uni grams and TwitterSA where the training data is composed by data from each source in isolation.For the TweetFeel website, where data is very bi ased (see Section 3), Unigrams obtained an error rate of 44.5% whereas over a sample of the same size of the combined training data (Figure 3), itobtained an error rate of around 30%.</S>
			<S sid="189" ssid="54">Our ap proach also performed worse over this data thanthe general one, but still had a reasonable er ror rate, 25.1%.</S>
			<S sid="190" ssid="55">Regarding the Twendz website, which is the noisiest one (Section 3), Unigrams also obtained a poor performance comparing itagainst its performance over a sample of the general data with a same size (see Table 5 and Fig ure 3).</S>
			<S sid="191" ssid="56">Our approach, on the other hand, was not much influenced by the noise (22.9% on noisy data and around 20% on the sample of same sizeof the general data).</S>
			<S sid="192" ssid="57">Finally, since the data qual ity provided by TwitterSentiment is better than the3For this experiment, we used the TwitterSA(single) con figuration.</S>

			<S sid="197" ssid="62">previous sources (Table 2), there was not much impact over both classifiers created from it.From this analysis over real data, we can con clude that our approach produces (1) an effective polarity classifier even when only a small number of training data is available; (2) a robust model tobias and noise in the training data; and (3) combining data sources with such distinct characteris tics, as our data analysis in Section 3 pointed out, is effective.</S>

			<S sid="199" ssid="1">There is a rich literature in the area of sentiment detection (see e.g., (Pang et al, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Go et al,2009; Glance et al, 2005).</S>
			<S sid="200" ssid="2">Most of these ap proaches try to perform this task on large texts, ase.g., newspaper articles and movie reviews.</S>
			<S sid="201" ssid="3">An other common characteristic of some of them isthe use of n-grams as features to create their mod els.</S>
			<S sid="202" ssid="4">For instance, Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2004) explores the fact that sentences close in a text might share the same subjectivity to create a better subjectivity detector and, similar to (Pang etal., 2002), uses unigrams as features for the polar ity detection.</S>
			<S sid="203" ssid="5">However, these approaches do not obtain a good performance on detecting sentimenton tweets, as we showed in Section 4, mainly be cause tweets are very short messages.</S>
			<S sid="204" ssid="6">In addition to that, since they use a raw word representation, they are more sensible to bias and noise, and needa much higher number of examples in the train ing data than our approach to obtain a reasonable performance.</S>
			<S sid="205" ssid="7">The Web sources used in this paper and some other websites provide sentiment detection for tweets.</S>
			<S sid="206" ssid="8">A great limitation to evaluate them is they do not make available how their classification was built.</S>
			<S sid="207" ssid="9">One exception is TwitterSentiment (Go et al., 2009), for instance, which considers tweets with good emoticons as positive examples and tweets with bad emoticons as negative examples for the training data, and builds a classifier using unigrams and bigrams as features.</S>
			<S sid="208" ssid="10">We showed in Section 4 that our approach works better than theirs for this problem, obtaining lower error rates.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusions and Future Work. " number="6">
			<S sid="209" ssid="1">We have presented an effective and robust sen timent detection approach for Twitter messages, which uses biased and noisy labels as input to build its models.</S>
			<S sid="210" ssid="2">This performance is due to the fact that: (1) our approach creates a more abstract representation of these messages, instead of usinga raw word representation of them as some previous approaches; and (2) although noisy and bi ased, the data sources provide labels of reasonablequality and, since they have different bias, com bining them also brought some benefits.</S>
			<S sid="211" ssid="3">The main limitation of our approach is the cases of sentences that contain antagonistic sentiments.</S>
			<S sid="212" ssid="4">As future work, we want to perform a more fine grained analysis of sentences in order to identifyits main focus and then based the sentiment clas sification on it.</S>
