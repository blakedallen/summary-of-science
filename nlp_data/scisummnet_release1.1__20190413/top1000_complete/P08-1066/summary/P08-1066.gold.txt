A New String-to-Dependency Machine Translation Algorithm with a Target Dependency Language Model
In this paper, we propose a novel string-to-dependency algorithm for statistical machine translation.
With this new framework, we employ a target dependency language model during decoding to exploit long distance word relations, which are unavailable with a traditional n-gram language model.
Our experiments show that the string-to-dependency decoder achieves 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER compared to a standard hierarchical string-tostring system on the NIST 04 Chinese-English evaluation set.
We presents a string-to-dependency model, which restricts the target side of each hierarchical rule to be a well-formed dependency tree fragment, and employs a dependency language model to make the output more grammatically.
