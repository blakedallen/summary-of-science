Language Independent NER Using A Maximum Entropy Tagger
Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems need to integrate a wide variety of information for optimal performance.
This paper demonstrates that a maximum entropy tagger can effectively encode such information and identify named entities with very high accuracy.
The tagger uses features which can be obtained for a variety of languages and works effectively not only for English, but also for other languages such as German and Dutch.
We condition the label of a token at a particular position on the label of the most recent previous instance of that same token in a prior sentence of the same document.
Our named entity recogniser is run on pos-tagged and chunked documents in the corpus to identify and extract named entities as potential topics.
