A Plan-Based Analysis Of Indirect Speech Act
We propose an account of indirect forms of speech acts to request and inform based on the hypothesis that language users can recognize actions being performed by others, infer goals being sought, and cooperate in their achievement.
This cooperative behaviour is independently motivated and may or may not be intended by speakers.
If the hearer believes it is intended, he or she can recognize the speech act as indirect; otherwise it is interpreted directly.
Heuristics are suggested to decide among the interpretations.
