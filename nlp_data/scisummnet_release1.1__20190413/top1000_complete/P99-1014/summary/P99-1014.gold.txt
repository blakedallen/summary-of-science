Inducing A Semantically Annotated Lexicon Via EM-Based Clustering
We present a technique for automatic induction of slot annotations for subcategorization frames, based on induction of hidden classes in the EM framework of statistical estimation.
The models are empirically evalutated by a general decision test.
Induction of slot labeling for subcategorization frames is accomplished by a further application of EM, and applied experimentally on frame observations derived from parsing large corpora.
We outline an interpretation of the learned representations as theoretical-linguistic decompositional lexical entries.
We test 3000 random verb-noun pairs, requiring the erbs and nouns to appear between 30 and 3000 times in training.
We use soft clustering to form classes for generalization and do not take recourse to any hand-crafter resources in our approach to selectional preference induction.
