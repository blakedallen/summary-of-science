Modeling Local Coherence: An Entity-Based Approach
This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence.
We present a novel entity-based representation of discourse which is inspired by Centering Theory and can be computed automatically from raw text.
We view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function.
Our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art coherence model.
To further refine the computation of the subsequence distribution, we divide the matrix into a salient matrix and a non-salient matrix.
We show that our entity based model is able to distinguish a source text from its permutation accurately.
We exploit the use of the distributional and referential information of discourse entities to improve summary coherence.
