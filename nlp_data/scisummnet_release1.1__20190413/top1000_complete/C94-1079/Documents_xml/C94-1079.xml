			<S sid="4" ssid="4">Principle-based grammars, such as Govern- ment-Binding (GB) theory (Chomsky, 1981; Haegeman, 1991), offer many advantages over rule-based and unification-based grammars, such as the universality ofprinciples and mod- ularity of components in the grammar.</S>
			<S sid="5" ssid="5">Prin- ciples are constraints over X-bar structures.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Most previous principle-based parsers, e.g., (Dorr, 1991; Font, 1991; Johnson, 1991), es- sentially generate all possible X-bar structures of a sentence and then use the principles to fil- ter out the illicit ones.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">The drawback of this approach is the inefficiency due 1;o the large number of candidate structures to be.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">filtered out.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">The problem persists even when w~rions techniques such as optimal ordering of princi- ples (Fong, 1991), and corontining (Dorr, 1991; Johnson, 1991) are used.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">This problem may also account for the fact that these parsers are experimental nd have limited coverage.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">This paper describes an efficient, broad- coverage, principle-based parser, called PRIN- CIPAR.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">The main innovation in PRINCIPAR is that it applies principles to descriptions o17 X- bar structures rather than the structures them- selves.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">X-bar structures of a sentence are only built when their descriptions have satisfied all the pri ncil)les.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">O dynamic data \ [~ static dala l)rocegsing module data flow Figure 1: '.Pile architecture of PRINCIPAR Figure I shows the architecture of PRIN- CIPAR.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">Sentence analysis is divided into three steps.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">The lexical analyser first converts the in- put sentence into a set of texical items.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">Then, a message passing algorithm for OB-parsing is used to construct a shared parse forest.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">Fi- nally, a parse tree retriever is used to enumer- ate the parse trees.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">The key idea of the parsing algorithm was presented in (tin, 199:1).</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">This paper presents some implementation details and experimental results.</S>

			<S sid="21" ssid="1">The parser in PIHNCIPAR is based on a message-passing framework proposed by \],in (1993) and l,in and Ooebel (1993), which uses a network to encode the grammar.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="2">The nodes in tile grammar network represent grammati- cal categories (e.g., NP, Nbar, N) or subcate- gories, such as V:NP (transitive verbs that take NPs as complements).</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="3">The links in the net- work re.present relationships bel;ween the cat- egories.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="4">GB-principles are implemented as lo- cal constraints attached to the nodes and 482 perco la t ion cormtra in ts attached to links in the network.</S>

			<S sid="57" ssid="37">The input sentence is parsed in the follow- ing steps.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="38">Step 1: Lex iea l Look-up : Retrieve the lex- ical entries for all the words in the sentence and create a lexical item for each word sense.</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="39">A lexical item is a triple: &lt;\[i,j\], av~lf, av ..... p&gt;, where \[i,j\] is an interval denoting the position of the word in the sentence; av~lf is the at- tribute values of the word sense; and av,:o,,,, is the attr ibute values of the complements of the word sense.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="40">Step 2: Message Passing: For each lexi- eel item &lt;\[i,j\], av~lf, av ..... p&gt;, create an initiM message &lt;\[i,j\], av~r, 0&gt; and send this message to the grammar network node that represents the category or subcategory of the word sense.</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="41">When the node receives the initial message, it may forward the message to other nodes or it ma,y combine the message with other messages and send the resulting combination to other nodes.</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="42">This initiates a message passing pro- cess which stops when there are no more mes- sages to be passed around.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="43">At that point, the initial message for the next lexical item is fed into the network.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="44">Step 3: Build a Shared Parse Forest When all lexieal items have been processed, a shared parse forest for the input sentence can be built by tracing the origins of the messages at the highest node (CP or IP), whose str com- ponent is the whole sentence.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="45">The parse forest consists of the links of the grammar network that are traversed uring the tracing process.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="46">The structure of the parse forest is similar to (Billot and Long, 1989) and (Tomita, 1986), but extended to include attribute values.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="47">The parse trees of the input sentence can be retrieved h'om the parse forest one by one.</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="48">The next section explains how tile constraints attached to the nodes and links in the network ensure that the parse trees satisfy all the prin- ciples.</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="49">GB principles are implemented as local and percolation constraints on the items.</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="50">Lo- cal constraints are attached to nodes in the network.</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="51">All items at a node must satisfy the node's local constraint, l?ercolation con- straints are attached to the links in the net- work.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="52">A message can be sent across a link only if the item satisfies the percolation constraint of the link.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="53">We will only use two examples to give the reader a general idea about how GB principles are interpreted as loc, al and percolation con- straints.</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="54">Interested reader is referred to Lin (1993) for more details.</S>
			<S sid="75" ssid="55">3.1.</S>
			<S sid="76" ssid="56">Bound ing rpheory.</S>
			<S sid="77" ssid="57">The Bounding Theory (Subjaneency) states that a movement can cross at most one bar- rier without leaving an intermedia~te trace.</S>
			<S sid="78" ssid="58">An attribute named ~hbarr?0r is used to imple- ment this l)rinciple.</S>
			<S sid="79" ssid="59">A message containing the attribute value -whbarrier iS used to rep- resent an X-bar structure contMnlng a posi- tion out ol7 which a wh-constituent has moved, but without yet crossing a barrier.</S>
			<S sid="80" ssid="60">The wdue +whbarrier means that the movement has M- ready crossed one barrier.</S>
			<S sid="81" ssid="61">Certain dominance links in the network are designated as bar- rier links.</S>
			<S sid="82" ssid="62">Bounding condition is implemented by tile percolation constraints attached to the barrier links, which block any message with +whbarrier and change -whbarrior to +whbarrier before the message is allowed to pass through.</S>
			<S sid="83" ssid="63">3.2.</S>
			<S sid="84" ssid="64">Case Theory.</S>
			<S sid="85" ssid="65">Case.</S>
			<S sid="86" ssid="66">Theory reqlfires tha.t every lexicM NP be assigned an al)stl'act case.</S>
			<S sid="87" ssid="67">'\]'he implementation of case theory in PI{,INCII~AII, is based on the following attribute vaJues: ca, govern, cm.</S>
			<S sid="88" ssid="68">+ca the head is ,~ c~se assigner -ca the head is not a case assigner +govern the head is a governor -govern the head is not a governor -cr~ an NP m-commanded by the head needs case marking The case filter is implemented as follows: 1.</S>

			<S sid="95" ssid="75">The -cm al;tril)ute then propagates with tile item as it is sent to el;her nodes.</S>

			<S sid="98" ssid="78">Since each node in X-1)ar strncture has at most one governor, if the governor is not a case assigner, the node will not l)e case-marked.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="79">Therei'ore, a case-filter vi- olation is detected if +govern -cm - ca co- occur in an item.</S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="80">On the other han&lt;l, if +govern +ca -cm co-ocetlr itl all item, +,;lien the head daughter of th&lt;; it&lt;,m gov- e rns and case:marks the origin of-cm.</S>

			<S sid="102" ssid="82">'\]'he -cm attril)ute is cleared.</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="83">The local constraints attached to all the nodes check for the ('.o-occurrences l ca, cm, and govern to ensure &lt;:ase-filter is not violated by any item.</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="84">4.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="85">Lex icon.</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="86">The lexicon in PRINCIPAl{ consists of two hash tables: a primary one in memory and a secondary one on disk.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="87">Tile secondary hash ta.= ble contains over 90,000 entries, most of which are constructed automatically by applying a set of extraction and conw:rsion rules to etP tries in Oxford Adwmced \],eaner's l)ictionary and Collins English I)ictionary.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="88">When a word is looked up, t;he F, rimary hashtable is searched first.</S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="89">If a,n entry for the word is found, the lexical search is done.</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="90">Oth- erwise, the secondary hash table is searched.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="91">The entry retrieved from the secondary LaI)Ie is inserted into the primary one, so, tha,t when the word is encouutered again only in-memory search will be necessary.</S>
			<S sid="112" ssid="92">The primary hash table is lc, aded from a file a.L l;he system start-up.</S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="93">The file also serves as a buffer for changes to the secondary hash tM)le.</S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="94">When a lexical entry is ad(led or \]nc, dified, it is saved in the file for the prhnary hash table.</S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="95">The entry in the se&lt;:(mdary hash tal)le remains unchanged.</S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="96">Since the i)rimary hash tM)le is a lw~ws consulted first, its entrios override the (;orresponditlg entries in the seco\[ldary La})\]C. The reason why the buffer in needed is that the secondary hash table is designed ill such a way that update speed is sacrificed for the sake of ef\[icie.t retriewd.</S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="97">Therefore, updates to the secondary hash tal)le should I&gt;e done in batch and relatively infrequently.</S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="98">The tw(&gt;tier organization of the lexicon is transparent to the l)arser.</S>
			<S sid="119" ssid="99">That is, as far as the.</S>
			<S sid="120" ssid="100">parser is concerned, the lexic&lt;m is an o1&gt; jec{, that, given a word or a phrase, returns its lexical entry or ni l if the entry (lees not exist in the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid="121" ssid="101">I,cxical rctrievM is very el\[icient, with over 90,000 entries, the average l;ime to retrieve an entry is 0.002 secon&lt;l. 4.1 . Lexical Ent r ies All, hot@l the lexicon currently ttsed in I)I{IN - C'II&gt;AI{, contains only syl~.tactic information, it; may also be used to hoM other types of ilffof mation.</S>
			<S sid="122" ssid="102">Each lexical entry consists of ai1 eIltry word or phrase and a, list of functions with a,r- ~tllllClltS: (&lt; en~;ry-~ord-or-phras e&gt; (&lt;tune-name&gt; &lt;arg&gt; . . .</S>
			<S sid="123" ssid="103">&lt;arg&gt;) (&lt;gunc-name&gt; &lt;arg&gt; . . .</S>
			<S sid="124" ssid="104">&lt;art&gt;) (&lt;-June-name&gt; &lt;arg&gt;.</S>
			<S sid="125" ssid="105">&lt;ar t&gt;) ) For exanq)le, (acknowledge (subcat ((cat v)) (((cat i) -bare inf))) (subcat ( (ca t v ) ) ( ( ( ca t n) ( case acc ) ) ) ) (subcat ( (ca t v ) ) ( ( ( ca t c ) ) ) ) q'\]le f'/ltlctioII subcat t'eturt/s a stll)c&amp;|,egoriz&amp;- Lion frame of the word.</S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="106">The first argt l tne I l ( ; of t}te function is the attrHmte va,lues of the word 485 itself.</S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="107">The second argument of the function is a list of attribute value vector for the comple- ments of the word.</S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="108">For example, the above en- try means that acknowl edge is a verb that takes an IP, NP or CP as the complement.</S>
			<S sid="129" ssid="109">The lex- icon is extensible in that users can define new functions to suit their own needs.</S>
			<S sid="130" ssid="110">Current im- plementation of the lexicon also includes func- tions ref and phrase, which are explained in the next two subsections.</S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="111">4.2.</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="112">Reference Entr ies.</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="113">The lexicon does not contain separate ntries for regular variations of words.</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="114">When a word is not found in the lexicon, the lexleal retriever strips the endings of the word to recow~'r pos- sible base forms of the word and look them up in the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="115">For example, when the lc'xieal retriever fails to find an entry for "studies," it searches the lexicon for "studie," "studi" and "study."</S>
			<S sid="136" ssid="116">Only the last one of these has an en- try in the lexicon and its entry is returned.</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="117">Irregular variations of words are explicitly listed in the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid="138" ssid="118">For example, there is an entry for the word "began."</S>
			<S sid="139" ssid="119">IIowever, the snb- catgorization frames of "begin" are not listed again under "began."</S>
			<S sid="140" ssid="120">Instead, the entry con- tains a ref fimction which returns a reference to the entry for "begin."</S>
			<S sid="141" ssid="121">(began (ref ((cat v) (vform ed) -prog-perf-passive (tense past))) (begin (cat)))) The first argument of ref is the attribute val- ues of "began."</S>
			<S sid="142" ssid="122">The second argument contains the base form of the word and a set of at- tribute names.</S>
			<S sid="143" ssid="123">The lexical items for the word "began" is obtained by unifying its attribute values with the attribute wdues in the lexiea\] entry for "begin."</S>
			<S sid="144" ssid="124">The advantage of making references to the base form is that when the base form is modified, one does not have to make changes to the entries for its variations.</S>
			<S sid="145" ssid="125">4.a. Phrasal Entr ies \]'he lexicon also allows for phrases that consist of multiple words.</S>
			<S sid="146" ssid="126">One of the words in a phrase is designated as the head word.</S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="127">The head word should be a word in the phrase that can un- dergo morphological changes and is the most in frequent.</S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="128">For example, in the phrase, "down payment," the head word is "payment."</S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="129">In d~e lexicon, a phrase "wl . . .</S>
			<S sid="150" ssid="130">wj . . .</S>
			<S sid="151" ssid="131">w,,/' is stored as a s t r ing "'Wh . . .</S>
			<S sid="152" ssid="132">'tOn, 101 . . .</S>
			<S sid="153" ssid="133">'U,~h_l."</S>
			<S sid="154" ssid="134">That is, the first word in the string is always head word and the words Mter "," should ap- pear before the head word in texts.</S>
			<S sid="155" ssid="135">The rune- don phrases converts il, s arguments into a list of phrases where tile entry word is the head.</S>
			<S sid="156" ssid="136">l,'or example, the lexical entry for "paymenC' is as follows: (payment (subcat ((cat n) (nform norm))) (phrases (payment, down) (payment, stop) (payment, token) (payment, transfer))) After retrieving the entry for a word, each phrase in the phrase list is compared with the surrounding words in the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="157" ssid="137">If the phrase is found in the sentence, the entry for the phrase is retrieved froin the lexicon.</S>
			<S sid="158" ssid="138">5.</S>
			<S sid="159" ssid="139">Reducing Ambiguities.</S>
			<S sid="160" ssid="140">One of the problems with many parsers is that they typically generate far more parses than humans normally do.</S>
			<S sid="161" ssid="141">I"or example, the average number of parses pet' word is 1.35 in (l\]lack et al, 1992).</S>
			<S sid="162" ssid="142">That means that their parser produces, on average, 8 parses for a 7-word sentence, 3d parses for a, l%word sentence, and ld4 l)a.rses for a 17-word seiRe.nce, rphe la.rge number of parse trees make tim l~roe(,ssing at later stages more dillicult and error l)ruTte.</S>
			<S sid="163" ssid="143">PI{INCII)AI{ defines a weight for every parse tree.</S>
			<S sid="164" ssid="144">A weight is associated with every word sense and every link in the parse tree.</S>
			<S sid="165" ssid="145">\[Pile weight of the parse tree is the total weight of the links and the word senses ~tt the leaf nodes of the tree.</S>
			<S sid="166" ssid="146">The packed shared parse forest in PtUN- CIPAI{.</S>
			<S sid="167" ssid="147">is organized in such a way that the parse tree with minimum weight is retrieved first.</S>
			<S sid="168" ssid="148">I~IUNCIPAII, then uses the minimum weight and a predetermined number called BIGWEIGHT, which is currently arbitraryly de- fined to be 20, to prune the parse forest.</S>
			<S sid="169" ssid="149">Only 486 the parse trees whose weights are less than (minimum weiglit -F BIGWEIGHT/2) are spared and output.</S>
			<S sid="170" ssid="150">The weights of the links and word senses are determined as follows: e 'I'he links fi'om Xbar to an ad,imlct YP have weight=nlGWEIglIW and all the~ other links have weight=l.0.</S>
			<S sid="171" ssid="151">? The words in the lexicon ma,y have an attribute rar% which takes wdues from {very, very-very}.</S>
			<S sid="172" ssid="152">If a word sense has the attribute value (rare very), its weight is BIGWEIGIIT.</S>
			<S sid="173" ssid="153">I fa word sense has the attribute value (rare very-very), its weight is 2?BIGWEIGIIT.</S>
			<S sid="174" ssid="154">Otherwise, the weight is 0, Note that the att;ribute rare is used to indicate the relative frequency among different stmses of the same word.</S>
			<S sid="175" ssid="155">/II~ /I L bigwe!ght L ', John John V /~; NP'~/N p /~N~, about Kim read a/ ~b~r read /NP.</S>
			<S sid="176" ssid="156">a /)N bar N I~P s tory /X N story about Kim (a) (b) Figure 3: Adjunct links ha,re higher weights Example 5.1.</S>
			<S sid="177" ssid="157">Comparing the two parses of the sentence "John read the story a,bout Kim" in Figure 3: in (a), lee about Kim\] is the co,n- plement of "story"; in (b), it is the a.djunct of "read".</S>
			<S sid="178" ssid="158">Since the adjunct dominance link from Vbar to PP has much higher weight than the complement dominance link from Nba.r to PP, the total weight of (a) is much smaller them the weight of (b).</S>
			<S sid="179" ssid="159">Therefore, only (a) is output as the parse tree of the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="180" ssid="160">Example 5.2.</S>
