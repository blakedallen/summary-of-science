The Grammar Matrix: An Open-Source Starter-Kit For The Rapid Development Of Cross-Linguistically Consistent Broad-Coverage Precision Grammars
The grammar matrix is an open-source starter-kit for the development of broad-coverage HPSGs.
By using a type hierarchy to represent cross-linguistic generalizations and providing compatibility with other open-source tools for grammar engineering, evaluation, parsing and generation, it facilitates not only quick start-up but also rapid growth towards the wide coverage necessary for robust natural language processing and the precision parses and semantic representations necessary for natural language understanding.
Our LinGO Grammar Matrix project is both a repository of reusable linguistic knowledge and a method of delivering this knowledge to a user in the form of an extensible precision implemented grammar.
