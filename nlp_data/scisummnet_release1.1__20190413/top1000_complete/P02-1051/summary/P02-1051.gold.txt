Translating Named Entities Using Monolingual And Bilingual Resources
Named entity phrases are some of the most difficult phrases to translate because new phrases can appear from nowhere, and because many are domain specific, not to be found in bilingual dictionaries.
We present a novel algorithm for translating named entity phrases using easily obtainable monolingual and bilingual resources.
We report on the application and evaluation of this algorithm in translating Arabic named entities to English.
We also compare our results with the results obtained from human translations and a commercial system for the same task.
We show that use of outside linguistic resources such as WWW counts of transliteration candidates can greatly boost transliteration accuracy.
A spelling-based model is described that directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences with associated probability that are trained on a small English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations.
The phonetics-based and spelling-based models have been linearly combined into a single transliteration model.
We use Web statistics information to validate the translation candidates generated by language model, and obtained the accuracy of 72.6% in Arabic-English OOV word translation.
