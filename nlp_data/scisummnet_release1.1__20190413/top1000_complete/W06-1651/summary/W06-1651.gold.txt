Joint Extraction Of Entities And Relations For Opinion Recognition
We present an approach for the joint extraction of entities and relations in the context of opinion recognition and analysis.
We identify two types of opinion-related entities — expressions of opinions and sources of opinions — along with the linking relation that exists between them.
Inspired by Roth and Yih (2004), we employ an integer linear programming approach to solve the joint opinion recognition task, and show that global, constraint-based inference can significantly boost the performance of both relation extraction and the extraction of opinion-related entities.
Performance further improves when a semantic role labeling system is incorporated.
The resulting system achieves F-measures of 79 and 69 for entity and relation extraction, respectively, improving substantially over prior results in the area.
We propose an ILP approach to jointly identify opinion holders, opinion expressions and their IS-FROM linking relations, and demonstrated the effectiveness of joint inference.
Others extend the token-level approach to jointly identify opinion holders (Choi et al 2006), and to determine the polarity and intensity of the opinion expressions (Choi and Cardie, 2010).
