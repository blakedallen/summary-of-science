Evaluating WordNet-based Measures of Lexical Semantic Relatedness
The quantification of lexical semantic relatedness has many applications in NLP, and many different measures have been proposed.
We evaluate five of these measures, all of which use WordNet as their central resource, by comparing their performance in detecting and correcting real-word spelling errors.
An information-contentâ€“based measure proposed by Jiang and Conrath is found superior to those proposed by Hirst and St-Onge, Leacock and Chodorow, Lin, and Resnik.
In addition, we explain why distributional similarity is not an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness.
WordNet based measures are well known to be better suited to measure similarity than relatedness due to its hierarchical, taxonomic structure.
