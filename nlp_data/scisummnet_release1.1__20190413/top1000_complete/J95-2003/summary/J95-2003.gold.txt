Centering: A Framework For Modeling The Local Coherence Of Discourse
This paper concerns relationships among focus of attention, choice of referring expression, and perceived coherence of utterances within a discourse segment.
It presents a framework and initial theory of centering intended to model the local component of attentional state.
The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions; it argues that differences in coherence correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions, given a particular attentional state.
It demonstrates that the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.
Our centering model uses a ranking of discourse entities realized in particular sentence sand computes transitions between adjacent sentences to provide insight in the felicity of texts.
Our centering theory postulates strong links between the center of attention in comprehension of adjacent sentences and syntactic position and form of reference.
Our centering Theory is an entity-based theory of local coherence, which claims that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others and that this property constrains a speaker's use of certain referring expressions.
Our centering Theory is an influential framework for modelling entity coherence in computational linguistics in the last two decades.
