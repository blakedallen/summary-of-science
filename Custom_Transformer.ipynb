      "the three-point function of planar quadrangulations arxiv:0805.2355v3 [math-ph] 24 jul 2008 j. bouttier and e. guitter institut de physique théorique cea, ipht, f-91191 gif-sur-yvette, france cnrs, ura 2306 jeremie.bouttier@cea.fr emmanuel.guitter@cea.fr abstract we compute the generating function of random planar quadrangulations with three marked vertices at prescribed pairwise distances. in the scaling limit of large quadrangulations, this discrete three-point function converges to a simple universal scaling function, which is the continuous three-point function of pure 2d quantum gravity. we give explicit expressions for this universal threepoint function both in the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. various limiting regimes are studied when some of the distances become large or small. by considering the case where the marked vertices are aligned, we also obtain the probability law for the number of geodesic points, namely vertices that lie on a geodesic path between two given vertices, and at prescribed distances from these vertices. 1. introduction 1.1. the problem maps are fundamental objects of discrete mathematics, usually defined as cellular embeddings of graphs into surfaces. they raise many interesting combinatorial and probabilistic questions. the understanding of their statistical properties is also relevant to physics, where random maps provide discrete models for fluctuating surfaces, for instance in the context of two-dimensional quantum gravity [1]. many results have been obtained over the years for the enumeration of various families of maps, including maps carrying spins or particles. besides tutte's original approach using some recursive decomposition of the maps [2], several new techniques of enumeration were introduced over the years, using for instance random matrix integrals [3,4] or, more recently, bijections with decorated trees like \"blossom trees\" [5-10] or \"well-labeled trees\" [11-14]. so far, most enumeration results dealt however with global properties of the maps, consisting in simply counting these maps or computing global correlations functions for some observables, obtained by averaging over the position of the points where these observables are measured (see [4]). to fully understand the structure of random maps, 1 it is however necessary to have access to local correlations, in which one controls the distance between the points where the measure takes place [15,16]. very little is known at this time about local correlations but many results in this direction should be within reach by a proper use of the above-mentioned bijection with well-labeled trees. indeed, in this approach, the coding of maps into trees makes explicit reference to the graph distance to some origin vertex, thus keeping track in the enumeration of a number of graph distances between vertices. a first progress was achieved in ref. [17], where the so-called canonical two-point function of quadrangulations was computed. this function gives the average number of pairs of vertices at prescribed distance from each other in the ensemble of quadrangulations (i.e. maps with only tetravalent faces) with a fixed number of faces. in particular, for large quadrangulations and at large distances, a sensible scaling limit can be obtained where the two-point function converges to some universal scaling function, which is the two-point function of pure 2d quantum gravity [15,17]. another recent progress was made in ref.[18], where the question of geodesic paths between two vertices in random quadrangulations was addressed, and a number of results were obtained on the actual dependence of the statistics of geodesics on the distance between their endpoints. in this paper, we address the question of the three-point function of planar quadrangulations, consisting in enumerating triply-pointed quadrangulations, i.e. quadrangulations with three marked vertices at prescribed pairwise distances. our main result is an explicit formula for the generating function of such triply-pointed quadrangulations counted with a weight g per face. our approach relies on an extension by miermont of the bijection with well-labeled trees which allows to treat the case of multiply-pointed quadrangulations [19] via a coding by more general well-labeled maps, which can then be enumerated. considering the scaling limit of large quadrangulations and large distances, we then give explicit expressions for the universal scaling form of this three-point function, in both grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. in the language of 2d quantum gravity, this constitutes the continuous three-point function for the universality class of the so-called pure gravity, with the planar topology. we discuss here its main properties. the paper is organized as follows: in section 1.2, we start by briefly recalling some known results about the two-point function of quadrangulations, and its continuum limit. we then present in section 2 our results for the three-point function. we give in section 2.1 the explicit formula for the generating function g(d12 , d23 , d31 ;\n",
