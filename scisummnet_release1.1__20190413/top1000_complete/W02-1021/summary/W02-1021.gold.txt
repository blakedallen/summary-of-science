Generation Of Word Graphs In Statistical Machine Translation
The paper describes a natural language based expert system route advisor for the public bus transport in Trondheim, Norway.
The system is available on the Internet, and has been intstalled at the bus company's web server since the beginning of 1999.
The system is bilingual, relying on an internal language independent logic representation.
In between the question and the answer is a process of lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, pragmatic reasoning and database query processing.
One could argue that the information content could be solved by an interrogation, whereby the customer is asked to produce 4 items: station of departure, station of arrival, earliest departure time and/or latest arrival time.
We generate word graphs for a bottom-top search with the IBM constraints.
A word graph is a weighted directed acyclic graph in which each node represents a partial translation hypothesis and each edge is labelled with a word of the target sentence and is weighted according to the scores given by the model.
