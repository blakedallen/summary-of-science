Dependency-based Syntactic&#x2013;Semantic Analysis with PropBank and NomBank
This paper presents our contribution in the closed track of the 2008 CoNLL Shared Task (Surdeanu et al., 2008).
To tackle the problem of joint syntactic-semantic analysis, the system relies on a syntactic and a semantic subcomponent.
The syntactic model is a bottom-up projective parser using pseudo-projective transformations, and the semantic model uses global inference mechanisms on top of a pipeline of classifiers.
The complete syntactic-semantic output is selected from a candidate pool generated by the subsystems.
The system achieved the top score in the closed challenge: a labeled syntactic accuracy of 89.32%, a labeled semantic F1 of 81.65, and a labeled macro F1 of 85.49.
Our system use two 30 different subsystems to handle verbal and nominal predicates, respectively.
We present importance of capturing non-local dependencies of core arguments in predicate-argument structure analysis.
In our work, the impact of different grammatical representations on the task of frame-based shallow semantic parsing is studied and the poor lexical generalization problem is outlined.
