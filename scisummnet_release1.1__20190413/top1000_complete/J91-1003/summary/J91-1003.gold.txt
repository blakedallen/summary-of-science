met*: A Method For Discriminating Metonymy And Metaphor By Computer
The met* method distinguishes selected examples of metonymy from metaphor and from literalness and anomaly in short English sentences.
In the met* method, literalness is distinguished because it satisfies contextual constraints that the nonliteral others all violate.
Metonymy is discriminated from metaphor and anomaly in a way that [1] supports Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) view that in metonymy one entity stands for another whereas in metaphor one entity is viewed as another, [2] permits chains of metonymies (Reddy 1979), and [3] allows metonymies to co-occur with instances of either literalness, metaphor, or anomaly.
Metaphor is distinguished from anomaly because the former contains a relevant analogy, unlike the latter.
The met* method is part of Collative Semantics, a semantics for natural language processing, and has been implemented in a computer program called meta5.
Some examples of meta5's analysis of metaphor and metonymy are given.
The met* method is compared with approaches from artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.
We use selectional preference violation technique to detect metaphors.
We developed a system called met*, capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy, metaphor and anomaly.
We build a system met*, which is designed to distinguish both metaphor and metonymy from literal text, providing special techniques for processing these instances of figurative language.
We developed a system called met*, capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy, metaphor and anomaly.
