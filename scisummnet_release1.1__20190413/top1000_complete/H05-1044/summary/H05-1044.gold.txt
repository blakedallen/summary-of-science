Recognizing Contextual Polarity In Phrase-Level Sentiment Analysis
This paper presents a new approach to phrase-level sentiment analysis that first determines whether an expression is neutral or polar and then disambiguates the polarity of the polar expressions.
With this approach, the system is able to automatically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of sentiment expressions, achieving results that are significantly better than baseline.
We propose supervised learning, dividing the resources into prior polarity and context polarity.
Our experiments indicate that lexicon-lookup approaches to subjectivity analysis will have limited success on general texts.
We manually construct polarity lexicon, in which each entry is annotated with its degree of subjectivity (strong, weak), as well as its sentiment polarity (positive, negative and neutral).
Our MPQA lexicon contains separate lexicons for subjectivity clues, intensifiers and valence shifters, which are used for identifying opinion roots, modifiers and negation words.
