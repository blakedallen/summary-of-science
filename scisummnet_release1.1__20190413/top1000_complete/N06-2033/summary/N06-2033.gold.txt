Parser Combination By Reparsing
We present a novel parser combination scheme that works by reparsing input sentences once they have already been parsed by several different parsers.
We apply this idea to dependency and constituent parsing, generating results that surpass state-of-the-art accuracy levels for individual parsers.
We introduce a threshold for the constituent count and search for the tree with the largest count number from all the possible constituent combinations.
We combine five parsers to obtain a score of 92.1, whereas the best single parser obtains a score of 91.0.
