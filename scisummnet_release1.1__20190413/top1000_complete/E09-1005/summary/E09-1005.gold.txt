Personalizing PageRank for Word Sense Disambiguation
In this paper we propose a new graph-based method that uses the knowledge in a LKB (based on WordNet) in order to perform unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation.
Our algorithm uses the full graph of the LKB efficiently, performing better than previous approaches in English all-words datasets.
We also show that the algorithm can be easily ported to other languages with good results, with the only requirement of having a wordnet.
In addition, we make an analysis of the performance of the algorithm, showing that it is efficient and that it could be tuned to be faster.
We propose Personalized PageRank (PPR) that tries to trade-off between the amount of the employed lexical information and the overall efficiency.
We initialize the ranks of the vertex at a uniform value (usually 1/N for a graph with N vertices).
We present a novel use of PageRank for word sense disambiguation.
The key idea is to adapt the matrix initialization step in order to exploit the available contextual evidence.
