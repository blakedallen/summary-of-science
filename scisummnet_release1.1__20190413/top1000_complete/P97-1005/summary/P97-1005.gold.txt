Automatic Detection Of Text Genre
As the text databases available to users become larger and more heterogeneous, genre becomes increasingly important for computational linguistics as a complement to topical and structural principles of classification.
We propose a theory of genres as bundles of facets, which correlate with various surface cues, and argue that genre detection based on surface cues is as successful as detection based on deeper structural properties.
We believe that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification.
We avoid structured markers since they require tagged or parsed text and replace them with character-level markers (e.g., punctuation mark counts) and derivative markers, i.e., ratios and variation measures derived from measure of lexical and character-level markers.
