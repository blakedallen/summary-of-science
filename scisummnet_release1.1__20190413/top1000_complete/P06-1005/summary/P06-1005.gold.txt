Bootstrapping Path-Based Pronoun Resolution
We present an approach to pronoun resolution based on syntactic paths.
Through a simple bootstrapping procedure, we learn the likelihood of coreference between a pronoun and a candidate noun based on the path in the parse tree between the two entities.
This path information enables us to handle previously challenging resolution instances, and also robustly addresses traditional syntactic coreference constraints.
Highly coreferent paths also allow mining of precise probabilistic gender/number information.
We combine statistical knowledge with well known features in a Support Vector Machine pronoun resolution classifier.
Significant gains in performance are observed on several datasets.
Given an automatically parsed corpus, we extract from each parse tree a dependency path, which is represented as a sequence of nodes and dependency labels connecting a pronoun and a candidate antecedent, and collect statistical information from these paths to determine the likelihood that a pronoun and a candidate antecedent connected by a given path are coreferent.
We show that learned gender is the most important feature in their pronoun resolution systems.
We achieve achieve state-of-the-art noun gender classification performance, and we make the database of the obtained noun genders available online.
We build a statistical model from paths that include the lemma of the intermediate tokens, but replace the end nodes with noun, pronoun, or pronoun-self for nouns, pronouns, and reflexive pronouns, respectively.
