Discourse Segmentation Of Multi-Party Conversation
We present a domain-independent topic segmentation algorithm for multi-party speech.
Our feature-based algorithm combines knowledge about content using a text-based algorithm as a feature and about form using linguistic and acoustic cues about topic shifts extracted from speech.
This segmentation algorithm uses automatically induced decision rules to combine the different features.
The embedded text-based algorithm builds on lexical cohesion and has performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms based on lexical information.
A significant error reduction is obtained by combining the two knowledge sources.
We provide gold standard for thematic segmentations by considering the agreement between at least three human annotations.
We propose the lexical chain based unsupervised segmenter (LCSeg) and a supervised segmenter for segmenting meeting transcripts.
Our LCseg system is the only word distribution based system evaluated on ICSI meeting data.
