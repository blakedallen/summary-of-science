Efficient Deep Processing Of Japanese
We present a broad coverage Japanese grammar written in the HPSG formalism with MRS semantics.
The grammar is created for use in real world applications, such that robustness and performance issues play an important role.
It is connected to a POS tagging and word segmentation tool.
This grammar is being developed in a multilingual context, requiring MRS structures that are easily comparable across languages.
Our hand-crafted Japanese HPSG grammar, JACY, provides semantic information as well as linguistically motivated analysis of complex constructions.
