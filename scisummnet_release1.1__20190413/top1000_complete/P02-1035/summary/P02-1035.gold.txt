Parsing The Wall Street Journal Using A Lexical-Functional Grammar And Discriminative Estimation Techniques
We present a stochastic parsing system consisting of a Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG), a constraint-based parser and a stochastic disambiguation model.
We report on the results of applying this system to parsing the UPenn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank.
The model combines full and partial parsing techniques to reach full grammar coverage on unseen data.
The treebank annotations are used to provide partially labeled data for discriminative statistical estimation using exponential models.
Disambiguation performance is evaluated by measuring matches of predicate-argument relations on two distinct test sets.
On a gold standard of manually annotated f-structures for a subset of the WSJ treebank, this evaluation reaches 79% F-score.
An evaluation on a gold standard of dependency relations for Brown corpus data achieves 76% F-score.
We describe a discriminative LFG parsing model that is trained on standard (syntax only) tree bank annotations by treating each tree as a full LFG analysis with an observed c-structure and hidden f-structure.
XLE selects the most probable analysis from the potentially large candidate set by means of a stochastic disambiguation component based on a log-linear probability model that works on the packed representations.
