  <S sid="3" ssid="3">We propose (a) a lexical atfinity mode] where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words tluc- tuate randomly in their selectional prefer- ences, and (e) a. generative model where the speaker fleshes ()tit each words syntactic and concep{.ual structure without regard to the implications :for the hearer.</S>

  <S sid="5" ssid="5">in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning pa.rt- of-speech tags.</S>
  <S sid="6" ssid="6">1 In t roduct ion In recent years, the statistical parsing community has begun to reach out; for syntactic formalisms that recognize the individuality of words, l,ink grammars (Sleator and Pemperley, 1991) and lex- icalized tree-adjoining ranunars (Schabes, 1992) have now received stochastic treatments.</S>
  <S sid="7" ssid="7">Other researchers, not wishing to abandon context-flee grammar (CI"G) but disillusioned with its lexica] blind spot, have tried to re-parameterize stochas- tic CI"G in context-sensitive ways (Black et al., 1992) or have augmented the formalism with lex- ical headwords (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 11996).</S>
  <S sid="8" ssid="8">In this paper, we 1)resent a [lexible l)robat)ilistic parser that simultaneously assigns both part-of- sl)eech tags and a bare-bones dependency struc- ture (illustrate.d in l!igure 1).</S>
  <S sid="9" ssid="9">The choice o t a simple syntactic structure is deliberate: we would like to ask some basic questions about where hx- ical relationships al)pear and how best, to exploit *This materia.l is based upon work supported un- der a National Science I%undation Graduate Fellow- ship, and has benefited greatly from discussions with Mike Collins, Dan M(:lame(l, Mitch Marcus and Ad- wait Ratnaparkhi.</S>

  <S sid="74" ssid="74">Rather than having the model select a subset of the ~2 possible links, as in model A, and then discard the result unless each word has exactly one parent, we might restrict the model to picking out one parent per word to be- gin with.</S>
  <S sid="75" ssid="75">Model B generates a sequence of tagged words, then specifies a parent or more precisely, a type of parent for each word j.</S>
  <S sid="76" ssid="76">Of course model A also ends up selecting a par- ent tbr each word, but its calculation plays careful politics with the set of other words that happen to appear: in the senterl(;C: word j considers both the benefit of selecting i as a parent, and the costs of spurning all the other possible parents/  .Model B takes an appro;~ch at the opposite extreme, and simply has each word blindly describe its ideal parent.</S>
  <S sid="77" ssid="77">For example, price in Figure 3 might in- sist (with some probability) that it "depend on a verb to my right."</S>
  <S sid="78" ssid="78">To capture arity, words proba- bilistically specify their ideal children as well: fell is highly likely to want only one noun to its left.</S>
  <S sid="79" ssid="79">The form and coarseness of such specifications i a parameter of the model.</S>
  <S sid="80" ssid="80">When a word stochastically chooses one set of requirements on its parents and children, it is choosing what a link grammarian would call a dis- juuct (set of selectional preferences) for the word.</S>
  <S sid="81" ssid="81">We may thus imagine generating a Markov se- quence of tagged words as before, and then in- dependently "sense tagging" each word with a disjunct, a Choosing all the disjuncts does not quite specify a parse, llowever, if the disjuncts are sufficiently specific, it specifies at most one parse.</S>
  <S sid="82" ssid="82">Some sentences generated in this way are illegal because their disjuncts cannot be simulta- neously satisfied; as in model A, these sentences are said to be removed fiom the population, and the probabilities renormalized.</S>
  <S sid="83" ssid="83">A likely parse is therefore one that allows a likely and consistent aln our implementation, the distribution over pos- sible disjuncts is given by a pair of Markov processes, as in model C. set of sells(, tags; its probability in the population is given in (4).</S>
  <S sid="84" ssid="84">2.3 Mode l  C: Recurs ive  generat ion The final model we prol)ose is a generat ion model, as opposed l;o the comprehens ion  mo(l- els A and B (and to other comprehension modc, ls such as (l,afferty et al., 1992; Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996)).</S>
  <S sid="85" ssid="85">r]he contrast recalls an ohl debate over spoken language, as to whether its properties are driven by hearers acoustic needs (coml)rehen- sion) or speakers articulatory needs (generation).</S>
  <S sid="86" ssid="86">Models A and B suggest that spe~kers produce text in such a way that the grammatical relations can be easily decoded by a listener, given words preferences to associate with each other and tags preferences to follow each other.</S>
  <S sid="87" ssid="87">But model C says that speakers primary goal is to flesh out the syn tactic and conceptual structure [or each word they utter, surrounding it with arguments, modifiers, and flmction words as appropriate.</S>
  <S sid="88" ssid="88">According to model C, speakers hould not hesitate to add ex- tra prepositionM phrases to a noun, even if this lengthens ome links that are ordinarily short, or leads to tagging or attachment mzJ)iguities.</S>
  <S sid="89" ssid="89">The generation process is straightforward.</S>
  <S sid="90" ssid="90">Each time a word i is added, it generates a Markov sequence of (tag,word) pairs to serve, as its left children, and an separate sequence of (tag,word) pairs as its right children.</S>
  <S sid="91" ssid="91">Each Markov process, whose probabilities depend on the word i and its tag, begins in a speciM STAI{T state; the symbols it generates are added as is children, from closest to farthest, until it re~ches the STOP state, qhe process recurses for each child so generated.</S>
  <S sid="92" ssid="92">This is a sort of lexicalized context-free model.</S>
  <S sid="93" ssid="93">Suppose that the Markov process, when gem crating a child, remembers just the tag of the childs most recently generated sister, if any.</S>
  <S sid="94" ssid="94">Then the probability of drawing a given parse fiom the population is (5), where kid(i, c) denotes the cth- closest right child of word i, and where kid(i, O) = START and kid(i, 1 + #,ight-kids(i)) = STOP.</S>

  <S sid="150" ssid="150">Note that a spans signature must specify whether its endwords have parents.</S>
  <S sid="151" ssid="151">4 Bottom-Up Probabilities Is this one parser really compatible with all three probability models?</S>
  <S sid="152" ssid="152">Yes, but for each model, we must provide a way to keep tr~tck of probabilities as we parse.</S>
  <S sid="153" ssid="153">Bear in mind that models A, B, and C do not themselves pecify probabilities for all spans; intrinsically they give only probabilities for sentences.</S>
  <S sid="154" ssid="154">Mode l  C. Define each spans score to be the product of all probabilities of links within the span.</S>
  <S sid="155" ssid="155">(The link to i from its eth child is asso- ciated with the probability P r ( .</S>
  <S sid="156" ssid="156">When spans a and b are combined and one more link is added, it is easy to compute the resulting spans score: score(a), score(b)./?r(covering l ink)) When a span constitutes a parse of the whole input sentence, its score as just computed proves to be the parse probability, conditional on the tree root EOS, under model C. The highest-probability parse can therefore be built by dynamic program- ming, where we build and retain the highest- scoring span of each signature.</S>
  <S sid="157" ssid="157">Taking the Markov process to gen- erate (tag,word) pairs from right to left, we let (6) define the score of a span from word k to word (?.</S>
  <S sid="158" ssid="158">The first product encodes the Markovian proba- bility that the (tag,word) pairs k through g -  1 are as claimed by the span, conditional on the appear- ance of specific (tag,word) pairs at g, ~+1.</S>
  <S sid="159" ssid="159">~ Again, scores can be easily updated when spans combine, and the probability of a complete parse P, divided by the total probability of all parses that succeed in satisfying lexical preferences, is just P s  score.</S>
  <S sid="160" ssid="160">Finally, model A is scored the same as model B, except for the second factor in (6), SThe third factor depends on, e.g., kid(i,c- 1), which we recover flom the span signature.</S>
  <S sid="161" ssid="161">Also, mat- ters are complicated slightly by the probabilities asso- ciated with the generation of STOP.</S>
  <S sid="162" ssid="162">6Different k-g spans have scores conditioned on dif- ferent hypotheses about tag(g) and tag(g + 1); their signatures are correspondingly different.</S>
  <S sid="163" ssid="163">Under model B, a k-.g span may not combine with an 6-~n span whose tags violate its assumptions about g and g + 1.</S>

  <S sid="167" ssid="167">As usual, scores can be constructed from the bottom up (though tword(j) in the second factor of (7) is not available to the algorithm, j being outside the span, so we back off to word(j)).</S>
  <S sid="168" ssid="168">5 Empirical Comparison We have undertaken a careful study to compare these models success at generalizing from train- ing data to test data.</S>
  <S sid="169" ssid="169">Full results on a moderate corpus of 25,000+ tagged, dependency-annotated Wall Street Journal sentences, discussed in (Eis- ner, 1996), were not complete hi; press time.</S>
  <S sid="170" ssid="170">How- ever, Tables 1 2 show pilot results for a small set of data drawn from that corpus.</S>
  <S sid="171" ssid="171">(The full resnlts show substantially better performance, e.g., 93% correct tags and 87% correct parents fbr model C, but appear qualitatively similar.)</S>
  <S sid="172" ssid="172">The pilot experiment was conducted on a subset of 4772 of the sentences comprising 93,a~0 words and punctuation marks.</S>
  <S sid="173" ssid="173">The corpus was derived by semi-automatic means from the Penn Tree- bank; only sentences without conjunction were available (mean length=20, max=68).</S>
  <S sid="174" ssid="174">A ran- domly selected set of 400 sentences was set aside for testing all models; the rest were used to esti- mate the model parameters.</S>
  <S sid="175" ssid="175">In the pilot (unlike the full experiment), the parser was instructed to "back oil" from all probabilities with denomina- tors &lt; 10.</S>
  <S sid="176" ssid="176">For this reason, the models were insen- sitive to most lexical distinctions.</S>
  <S sid="177" ssid="177">In addition to models A, B, and C, described above, the pilot experiment evaluated two other models for comparison.</S>
  <S sid="178" ssid="178">Model C was a version of model C that ignored lexical dependencies be- tween parents and children, considering only de- pendencies between a parents tag and a childs tag.</S>
  <S sid="179" ssid="179">This model is similar to the model nsed by stochastic CFG.</S>
  <S sid="180" ssid="180">Model X did the same n-gram tagging as models A and B (~.</S>
  <S sid="181" ssid="181">= 2 for the prelim- inary experiment, rather than n = 3), but did not assign any links.</S>
