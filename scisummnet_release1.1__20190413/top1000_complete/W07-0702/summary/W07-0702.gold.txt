CCG Supertags in Factored Statistical Machine Translation
Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertags present phrase-based machine translation with an opportunity to access rich syntactic information at a word level.
The challenge is incorporating this information into the translation process.
Factored translation models allow the inclusion of supertags as a factor in the source or target language.
We show that this results in an improvement in the quality of translation and that the value of syntactic supertags in flat structured phrase-based models is largely due to better local reorderings.
we exploit factored phrase-based translation models to associate each word with a supertag, which contains most of the information needed to build a full parse.
