Prepositional Phrase Attachment Through A Backed-Off Model
Recent work has considered corpus-based or statistical approaches to the problem of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity.
Typically, ambiguous verb phrases of the form v rip1 p rip2 are resolved through a model which considers values of the four head words (v, nl, p and 77,2).
This paper shows that the problem is analogous to n-gram language models in speech recognition, and that one of the most common methods for language modeling, the backed-off estimate, is applicable.
Results on Wall Street Journal data of 84.5% accuracy are obtained using this method.
We use a Back-Off model, which enables them to take low frequency effects into account on the Ratnaparkhi dataset (with good results).
We introduce modifications to the Ratnaparkhi et al (1994) dataset meant to combat data sparsity and used the modified version to train their backed-off model.
