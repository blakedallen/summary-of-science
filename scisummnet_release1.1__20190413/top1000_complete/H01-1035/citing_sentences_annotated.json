    "raw_text": "This essential limitation of the Brown/Penn POSsubtag inventory to morphologically realized distinctions in English dramatically simplifies the problem by reducing the tag entropy per surface form (the adjective tall has only one POS tag (JJ) rather than numerous singular, plural, nominative, accusative, etc. variants), increasing both the standalone effectiveness of lexical prior models and word suffix models for part-of-speech tagging. However, for many multilingual applications, including feature-based word alignment in bilingual corpora and machine translation into morphologically richer languages, it is helpful to extract finer grained lexical analyses on the English side that more closely parallel the morphologically realized tag set of the second (source or target) language. In particular, prior work on trans lingual part-of speech tagger projection via parallel bilingual corpora (e.g. Yarowsky et al, 2001) has been limited to inducing part-of-speech taggers in second languages (such as French or Czech) that only assign tags at the granularity of their source language (i.e. 49the Penn Treebank-granularity distinctions from English)",
