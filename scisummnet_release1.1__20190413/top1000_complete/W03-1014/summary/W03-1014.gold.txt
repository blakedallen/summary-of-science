Learning Extraction Patterns For Subjective Expressions
This paper presents a bootstrapping process that learns linguistically rich extraction patterns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.
High-precision classifiers label unannotated data to automatically create a large training set, which is then given to an extraction pattern learning algorithm.
The learned patterns are then used to identify more subjective sentences.
The bootstrapping process learns many subjective patterns and increases recall while maintaining high precision.
We construct a high precision classifier for contiguous sentences using the number of strong and weak subjective words in current and nearby sentences.
We introduce a bootstrapping method to learn subjective extraction patterns that match specific syntactic templates using a high-precision sentence-level subjectivity classifier and a large unannotated corpus.
