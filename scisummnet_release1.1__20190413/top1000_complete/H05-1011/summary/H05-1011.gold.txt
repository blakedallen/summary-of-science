A Discriminative Framework For Bilingual Word Alignment
Bilingual word alignment forms the foundation of most approaches to statistical machine translation.
Current word alignment methods are predominantly based on generative models.
In this paper, we demonstrate a discriminative approach to training simple word alignment models that are comparable in accuracy to the more complex generative models normally used.
These models have the the advantages that they are easy to add features to and they allow fast optimization of model parameters using small amounts of annotated data.
LLR can still be used for extracting positive associations by filtering in a pre-processing step words with possibly negative associations.
We train two models we call stage 1 and stage 2, both in the form of a weighted linear combination of feature values extracted from a pair of sentences and a proposed word alignment of them.
We use statistics like log-likelihood-ratio and conditional likelihood-probability to measure word associations.
