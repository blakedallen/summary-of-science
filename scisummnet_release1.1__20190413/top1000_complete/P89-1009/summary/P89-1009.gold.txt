Cooking Up Referring Expressions
This paper describes the referring expression generation mechanisms used in EPICURE, a computer program which produces natural language descriptions of cookery recipes.
Major features of the system include: an underlying ontology which permits the representation of non-singular entities; a notion of discriminatory power, to determine what properties should be used in a description; and a PATR-like unification grammar to produce surface linguistic strings.
We produce a description entailing the minimal number of attributes possible at the price of suffering NP-hard complexity.
Our algorithm attempts to build a minimal distinguishing description by always selecting the most discriminatory property available.
We define minimality as the proportion of descriptions produced by a system that are maximally brief.
We propose a solution to the problem of generating definite descriptions that evoke a discourse entity already introduced in the context.
