Monolingual Machine Translation For Paraphrase Generation
We apply statistical machine translation (SMT) tools to generate novel paraphrases of input sentences in the same language.
The system is trained on large volumes of sentence pairs automatically extracted from clustered news articles available on the World Wide Web.
Alignment Error Rate (AER) is measured to gauge the quality of the resulting corpus.
A monotone phrasal decoder generates contextual replacements.
Human evaluation shows that this system outperforms baseline paraphrase generation techniques and, in a departure from previous work, offers better coverage and scalability than the current best-of-breed paraphrasing approaches.
we built a paraphrase generation model from a monolingual comparable corpus based on a statistical machine translation framework, where the language model assesses the grammaticality of the translations ,i.e., generated expressions.
we present an end-to-end paraphrasing system inspired by phrase-based machine translation that can both ac quire paraphrases and use them to generate new strings.
