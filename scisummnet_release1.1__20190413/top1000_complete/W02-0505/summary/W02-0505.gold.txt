Machine Transliteration Of Names In Arabic Texts
We present a transliteration algorithm based on sound and spelling mappings using finite state machines.
The transliteration models can be trained on relatively small lists of names.
We introduce a new spelling-based model that is much more accurate than state-of-the-art phonetic-based models and can be trained on easier-to-obtain training data.
We apply our transliteration algorithm to the transliteration of names from Arabic into English.
We report on the accuracy of our algorithm based on exact-matching criterion and based on human-subjective evaluation.
We also compare the accuracy of our system to the accuracy of human translators.
We transliterate named entities in Arabic text to English by combining phonetic-based and spelling-based models, and re-ranking candidates with full-name web counts, named entities co-reference, and contextual web counts.
We show that the use of outside linguistic resources such as WWW counts of transliteration candidates can greatly boost transliteration accuracy.
Out spelling-based model directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences with associated probability that are trained on a small English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations.
