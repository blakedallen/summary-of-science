Syntax Augmented Machine Translation Via Chart Parsing
We present translation results on the shared task ”Exploiting Parallel Texts for Statistical Machine Translation” generated by a chart parsing decoder operating on phrase tables augmented and generalized with target language syntactic categories.
We use a target language parser to generate parse trees for each sentence on the target side of the bilingual training corpus, matching them with phrase table lattices built for the corresponding source sentence.
Considering phrases that correspond to syntactic categories in the parse trees we develop techniques to augment (declare a syntactically motivated category for a phrase pair) and generalize (form mixed terminal and nonterminal phrases) the phrase table into a synchronous bilingual grammar.
We present results on the French-to-English task for this workshop, representing significant improvements over the workshop’s baseline system.
Our translation system is available open-source under the GNU General Public License.
In our work, syntax is successfully integrated into hierarchical SMT.
We start with a complete set of phrases as extracted by traditional PBMT heuristics, and then annotated the target side of each phrasal entry with the label of the constituent node in the target-side parse tree that subsumes the span.
We use broken syntactic fragments to augment their grammars to increase the rule coverage; while we learn optimal tree fragments transformed from the original ones via a generative framework, they enumerate the fragments available from the original trees without learning process.
