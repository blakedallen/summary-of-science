GATE: A Framework And Graphical Development Environment For Robust NLP Tools And Applications
In this paper we present GATE, a framework and graphical development environment which enables users to develop and deploy language engineering components and resources in a robust fashion.
The GATE architecture has enabled us not only to develop a number of successful applications for various language processing tasks (such as Information Extraction), but also to build and annotate corpora and carry out evaluations on the applications generated.
The framework can be used to develop applications and resources in multiple languages, based on its thorough Unicode support.
We include the ANNIE IE system in the standard GATE distribution for text tokenization, sentence splitting and part-of-speech tagging.
We propose mechanisms to help heterogeneous linguistic modules to communicate through a common XML interface.
