Co-Training for Cross-Lingual Sentiment Classification
The lack of Chinese sentiment corpora limits the research progress on Chinese sentiment classification.
However, there are many freely available English sentiment corpora on the Web.
This paper focuses on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which  leverages an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification by using the English corpus as training data.
Machine translation services are used for eliminating the language gap between the training set and test set, and English features and Chinese features are  considered as two independent views of the classification problem.
We propose a co-training approach to making use of unlabeled  Chinese data.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can outperform the standard inductive classifiers and the transductive classifiers.
The proposed co-regression algorithm can make full use of both the features in the source language and the features in the target language in a unified framework.
We propose to use ensemble method to train better Chinese sentiment classification model on English labeled data and their Chinese translation.
We leveraged an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification by using the co-training approach to make full use of both English and Chinese features in a unified framework.
