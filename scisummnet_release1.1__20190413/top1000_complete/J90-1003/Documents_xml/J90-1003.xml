  <SECTION title="WORD ASSOCIATION NORMS, MUTUAL INFORMATION, AND LEXICOGRAPHY" number="1">
    <S sid="22" ssid="1">The term word association is used in a very particular sense in the psycholinguistic literature.</S>

    <S sid="24" ssid="3">)We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word).</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="4">This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="5">(The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.)</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="6">The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words.</S>

  <SECTION title="1 MEANING AND ASSOCIATION" number="2">
    <S sid="28" ssid="1">It is common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their co-occurrence with other words.</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="2">Running through the whole Firthian tradition, for example, is the theme that &amp;quot;You shall know a word by the company it keeps&amp;quot; (Firth, 1957).</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="3">On the one hand, bank co-occurs with words and expression such as money, notes, loan, account, investment, clerk, official, manager, robbery, vaults, working in a, its actions, First National, of England, and so forth.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="4">On the other hand, we find bank co-occurring with river, swim, boat, east (and of course West and South, which have acquired special meanings of their own), on top of the, and of the Rhine.</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="5">(Hanks 1987, p. 127) The search for increasingly delicate word classes is not new.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="6">In lexicography, for example, it goes back at least to the &amp;quot;verb patterns&amp;quot; described in Hornby's Advanced Learner's Dictionary (first edition 1948).</S>
    <S sid="34" ssid="7">What is new is that facilities for the computational storage and analysis of large bodies of natural language have developed significantly in recent years, so that it is now becoming possible to test and apply informal assertions of this kind in a more rigorous way, and to see what company our words do keep.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="2 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS" number="3">
    <S sid="35" ssid="1">The proposed statistical description has a large number of potentially important applications, including: (a) constraining the language model both for speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR), (b) providing disambiguation cues for parsing highly ambiguous syntactic structures such as noun compounds, conjunctions, and prepositiona 1 phrases, (c) retrieving texts from large databases (e.g. newspapers, patents), (d) enhancing the productivity of computational linguists in compiling lexicons of lexicosyntactic facts, and (e) enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in identifying normal and conventional usage.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="2">Consider the optical character recognizer (OCR) application.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="3">Suppose that we have an OCR device as in Kahan et al. (1987), and it has assigned about equal probability to having recognized farm and form, where the context is either: (1) federal credit or (2) some of.</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="4">The proposed association measure can make use of the fact that farm is much more likely in the first context and form is much more likely in the second to resolve the ambiguity.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="5">Note that alternative disambiguation methods based on syntactic constraints such as part of speech are unlikely to help in this case since both form and farm are commonly used as nouns.</S>

  <SECTION title="3 WORD ASSOCIATION AND PSYCHOLINGUISTICS" number="4">
    <S sid="40" ssid="1">Word association norms are well known to be an important factor in psycholinguistic research, especially in the area of lexical retrieval.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="2">Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="3">Some results and implications are summarized from reaction-time experiments in which subjects either (a) classified successive strings of letters as words and nonwords, or (b) pronounced the strings.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="4">Both types of response to words (e.g.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="5">BUTTER) were consistently faster when preceded by associated words (e.g.</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="6">BREAD) rather than unassociated words (e.g.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="7">NURSE) (Meyer etal.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="8">1975, p. 98) Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on empirical estimates of word association norms as in Palermo and Jenkins (1964), perhaps the most influential study of its kind, though extremely small and somewhat dated.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="9">This study measured 200 words by asking a few thousand subjects to write down a word after each of the 200 words to be measured.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="10">Results are reported in tabular form, indicating which words were written down, and by how many subjects, factored by grade level and sex.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="11">The word doctor, for example, is reported on pp.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="12">98-100 to be most often associated with nurse, followed by sick, health, medicine, hospital, man, sickness, lawyer, and about 70 more words.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="4 AN INFORMATION THEORETIC MEASURE" number="5">
    <S sid="52" ssid="1">We propose an alternative measure, the association ratio, for measuring word association norms, based on the information theoretic concept of mutual information.'</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="2">The proposed measure is more objective and less costly than the subjective method employed in Palermo and Jenkins (1964).</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="3">The association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust estimates of word association norms for a large portion of the language.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="4">Using the association ratio measure, the five most associated words are, in order: dentists, nurses, treating, treat, and hospitals.</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="5">What is &amp;quot;mutual information?&amp;quot; According to Fano (1961), if two points (words), x and y, have probabilities P(x) and P(y), then their mutual information, I(x,y), is defined to be Informally, mutual information compares the probability of observing x and y together (the joint probability) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently (chance).</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="6">If there is a genuine association between x and y, then the joint probability P(x,y) will be much larger than chance P(x) P(y), and consequently I(x,y) &#187; 0.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="7">If there is no interesting relationship between x and y, then P(x,y) P(x) P(y), and thus, I(x,y) 0.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="8">If x and y are in complementary distribution, then P(x,y) will be much less than P(x) P(y), forcing I(x,y) &#171; 0.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="9">In our application, word probabilities P(x) and P(y) are estimated by counting the number of observations of x and y in a corpus, f (x) and f (y), and normalizing by N, the size of the corpus.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="10">(Our examples use a number of different corpora with different sizes: 15 million words for the 1987 AP corpus, 36 million words for the 1988 AP corpus, and 8.6 million tokens for the tagged corpus.)</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="11">Joint probabilities, P(x,y), are estimated by counting the number of times that xis followed by y in a window of w words,f,(x,y), and normalizing by N. The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="12">Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms such as bread and butter) and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="13">Table 1 may help show the contrast.2 In fixed expressions, such as bread and butter and drink and drive, the words of interest are separated by a fixed number of words and there is very little variance.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="14">In the 1988 AP, it was found that the two words are always exactly two words apart whenever they are found near each other (within five words).</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="15">That is, the mean separation is two, and the variance is zero.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="16">Compounds also have very fixed word order (little variance), but the average separation is closer to one word rather than two.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="17">In contrast, relations such as man/woman are less fixed, as indicated by a larger variance in their separation.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="18">(The nearly zero value for the mean separation for man/women indicates the words appear about equally often in either order.)</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="19">Lexical relations come in several varieties.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="20">There are some like refraining from that are fairly fixed, others such as coming from that may be separated by an argument, and still others like keeping from that are almost certain to be separated by an argument.</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="21">The ideal window size is different in each case.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="22">For the remainder of this paper, the window size, w, will be set to five words as a compromise; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments, but not so large that it would wash out constraints that make use of strict adjacency.3 Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small, we will not discuss word pairs with f (x,y) 5.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="23">An improvement would make use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not significant.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="24">Unfortunately, this requires an estimate of the variance off (x,y), which goes beyond the scope of this paper.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="25">For the remainder of this paper, we will adopt the simple but arbitrary threshold, and ignore pairs with small counts.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="26">Technically, the association ratio is different from mutual information in two respects.</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="27">First, joint probabilities are supposed to be symmetric: P(x, y) = P( y, x), and thus, mutual information is also symmetric: I(x, y) = I(y, x).</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="28">However, the association ratio is not symmetric, since f (x, y) encodes linear precedence.</S>
    <S sid="80" ssid="29">(Recall thatf (x, y) denotes the number of times that word x appears before y in the window of w words, not the number of times the two words appear in either order.)</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="30">Although we could fix this problem by redefining f (x, y) to be symmetric (by averaging the matrix with its transpose), we have decided not to do so, since order information appears to be very interesting.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="31">Notice the asymmetry in the pairs in Table 2 (computed from 44 million words of 1988 AP text), illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging from sexism to syntax.</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="32">Second, one might expect f (x, y) f(x) and f (x, y) f (y), but the way we have been counting, this needn't be the case if x and y happen to appear several times in the window.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="33">For example, given the sentence, &amp;quot;Library workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins,&amp;quot; which appeared in an AP story on April 1, 1988, f(prohibited) = 1 and f ( prohibited, from) = 2.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="34">This problem can be fixed by dividing f (x, y) by w &#8212; 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting log2 (w &#8212; 1) = 2 from our association ratio scores).</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="35">This adjustment has the addif(x, y) f(y, x) doctors nurses 99 10 man woman 256 56 doctors lawyers 29 19 bread butter 15 1 save life 129 11 save money 187 11 save from 176 18 supposed to 1188 25 tional benefit of assuring that f(x, y) = f(x) f (Y)= N. When /(x, y) is large, the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in Palermo and Jenkins (1964), as illustrated in Table 3.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="36">In contrast, when /(x, y) = 0, the pairs are less interesting.</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="37">(As a very rough rule of thumb, we have observed that pairs with /(x, y) &gt; 3 tend to be interesting, and pairs with smaller /(x, y) are generally not.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="38">One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures.</S>
    <S sid="90" ssid="39">Alternatively, one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence levels, e.g. with 95% confidence, P(x, y) &gt; P(x) P(y).)</S>
    <S sid="91" ssid="40">If /(x, y) &#171; 0, we would predict that x and y are in complementary distribution.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="41">However, we are rarely able to observe I(x, y) &#171; 0 because our corpora are too small (and our measurement techniques are too crude).</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="42">Suppose, for example, that both x and y appear about 10 times per million words of text.</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="43">Then, P(x) = P(y) = 10-5 and chance is P(x) P(x) = 10-1&#176;.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="44">Thus, to say that /(x, y) is much less than 0, we need to say that P(x, y) is much less than 10-1&#176;, a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="45">In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than 1/N , 10-7, and therefore it is hard to know if /(x, y) is much less than chance or not, unless chance is very large.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="46">(In fact, the pair a. .</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="47">. doctors in Table 3, appears significantly less often than chance.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="48">But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score downward by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to &#8212;1.04), and we need to estimate the standard deviation, using a method such as Good (1953).4</S>

  <SECTION title="5 LEXICO-SYNTACTIC REGULARITIES" number="6">
    <S sid="100" ssid="1">Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/ nurse in considerable detail, relatively little is said about associations among verbs, function words, adjectives, and other non-nouns.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="2">In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexicosyntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments/adjuncts.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="3">The proposed association ratio can be viewed as a formalization of Sinclair's argument: How common are the phrasal verbs with set?</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="4">Set is particularly rich in making combinations with words like about, in, up, out, on, off, and these words are themselves very common.</S>

    <S sid="125" ssid="26">In the 1988 AP corpus (N = 44,344,077), we estimate P(set) 13,046/N, P(off) 20,693/N, and P(set, off) 463/N.</S>

    <S sid="135" ssid="2">We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to/in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to/to.</S>

    <S sid="154" ssid="16">Although this technology is a great improvement on using human readers to collect boxes of citation index cards (the method Murray used in constructing The Oxford English Dictionary a century ago), it works well if there are no more than a few dozen concordance lines for a word, and only two or three main sense divisions.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="17">In analyzing a complex word such as take, save, or from, the lexicographer is trying to pick out significant patterns and subtle distinctions that are buried in literally thousands of concordance lines: pages and pages of computer printout.</S>

    <S sid="157" ssid="19">This application of Hindle's parser illustrates a second example of preprocessing the input to highlight certain constraints of interest.</S>
    <S sid="158" ssid="20">For measuring syntactic constraints, it may be useful to include some part of speech information and to exclude much of the internal structure of noun phrases.</S>
    <S sid="159" ssid="21">For other purposes, it may be helpful to tag items and/or phrases with semantic labels such as *person*, *place*, *time*, *body part*, *bad*, and so on.</S>

    <S sid="165" ssid="6">&amp;quot; cant patterns, let alone group them and rank them in order of importance.</S>
    <S sid="166" ssid="7">The AP 1987 concordance to save is many pages long; there are 666 lines for the base form alone, and many more for the inflected forms saved, saves, saving, and savings.</S>
    <S sid="167" ssid="8">In the discussion that follows, we shall, for the sake of simplicity, not analyze the inflected forms and we shall only look at the patterns to the right of save (see Table 7).</S>
    <S sid="168" ssid="9">It is hard to know what is important in such a concordance and what is not.</S>
    <S sid="169" ssid="10">For example, although it is easy to see from the concordance selection in Figure 1 that the word &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; often comes before &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; and the word &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; often comes after &amp;quot;save,&amp;quot; it is hard to say from examination of a concordance alone whether either or both of these co-occurrences have any significance.</S>
    <S sid="170" ssid="11">Two examples will illustrate how the association ratio measure helps make the analysis both quicker and more accurate.</S>
    <S sid="171" ssid="12">The association ratios in Table 7 show that association norms apply to function words as well as content words.</S>
    <S sid="172" ssid="13">For example, one of the words significantly associated with save is from.</S>
    <S sid="173" ssid="14">Many dictionaries, for example Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam Webster), make no explicit mention of from in the entry for save, although British learners' dictionaries do make specific mention of from in connection with save.</S>
    <S sid="174" ssid="15">These learners' dictionaries pay more attention to language structure and collocation than do American collegiate dictionaries, and lexicographers trained in the British tradition are often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations.</S>
    <S sid="175" ssid="16">However, teasing out such facts and distinguishing true intuitions from false intuitions takes a lot of time and hard work, and there is a high probability of inconsistencies and omissions.</S>
    <S sid="176" ssid="17">Which other verbs typically associate with from, and where does save rank in such a list?</S>
    <S sid="177" ssid="18">The association ratio identified 1530 words that are associated with from; 911 of them were tagged as verbs.</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="19">The first 100 verbs are: refrain/vb, gleaned/vbn, stems/vbz, stemmed/vbd, stemming/vbg, ranging/vbg, stemmed/vbn, ranged/ vbn, derived/vbn, ranged/vbd, extort/vb, graduated/ vbd, barred/vbn, benefiting/vbg, benefitted/vbn, benefited/vbn, excused/vbd, arising/vbg, range/vb, exempts/ vbz, suffers/vbz, exempting/vbg, benefited/vbd, prevented/vbd (7.0), seeping/vbg, barred/vbd, prevents/ vbz, suffering/vbg, excluded/vbn, marks/vbz, profiting/ vbg, recovering/vbg, discharged/vbn, rebounding/vbg, vary/vb, exempted/vbn, separate/vb, banished/vbn, withdrawing/vbg, ferry/vb, prevented/vbn, profit/vb, bar/vb, excused/vbn, bars/vbz, benefit/vb, emerges/ vbz, emerge/vb, varies/vbz, differ/vb, removed/vbn, exempt/vb, expelled/vbn, withdraw/vb, stem/vb, separated/vbn, judging/vbg, adapted/vbn, escaping/vbg, inherited/vbn, differed/vbd, emerged/vbd, withheld/vbd, leaked/vbn, strip/vb, resulting/vbg, discourage/vb, prevent/vb, withdrew/vbd, prohibits/vbz, borrowing/vbg, preventing/vbg, prohibit/vb, resulted/vbd (6.0), preclude/vb, divert/vb, distinguish/vb, pulled/vbn, fell/ vbn, varied/vbn, emerging/vbg, suffer/vb, prohibiting/ vbg, extract/vb, subtract/vb, recover/vb, paralyzed/ vbn, stole/vbd, departing/vbg, escaped/vbn, prohibited/ vbn, forbid/vb, evacuated/vbn, reap/vb, barring/vbg, removing/vbg, stolen/vbn, receives/vbz.</S>

    <S sid="180" ssid="21">.</S>
    <S sid="181" ssid="22">. from is a good example for illustrating the advantages of the association ratio.</S>
    <S sid="182" ssid="23">Save is ranked 319th in this list, indicating that the association is modest, strong enough to be important (21 times more likely than chance), but not so strong that it would pop out at us in a concordance, or that it would be one of the first things to come to mind.</S>
    <S sid="183" ssid="24">If the dictionary is going to list save .</S>
    <S sid="184" ssid="25">.</S>
    <S sid="185" ssid="26">. from, then, for consistency's sake, it ought to consider listing all of the more important associations as well.</S>
    <S sid="186" ssid="27">Of the 27 bare verbs (tagged `vb') in the list above, all but seven are listed in Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary as occurring with from.</S>
    <S sid="187" ssid="28">However, this dictionary does not note that vary, ferry, strip, divert, forbid, and reap occur with from.</S>
    <S sid="188" ssid="29">If the Cobuild lexicographers had had access to the proposed measure, they could possibly have obtained better coverage at less cost.</S>
    <S sid="189" ssid="30">Having established the relative importance of save .</S>

    <S sid="192" ssid="33">Ideally, we would like to develop a set of semi-automatic tools that would help a lexicographer produce something like Figure 2, which provides an annotated summary of the 65 concordance lines for save .</S>
    <S sid="193" ssid="34">.</S>

    <S sid="196" ssid="37">. from pattern occurs in about 10% of the 666 concordance lines for save.</S>
    <S sid="197" ssid="38">Traditionally, semantic categories have been only vaguely recognized, and to date little effort has been devoted to a systematic classification of a large corpus.</S>
    <S sid="198" ssid="39">Lexicographers have tended to use concordances impressionistically; semantic theorists, AI-ers, and others have concentrated on a few interesting examples, e.g. bachelor, and have not given much thought to how the results might be scaled up.</S>
    <S sid="199" ssid="40">With this concern in mind, it seems reasonable to ask how well these 65 lines for save.</S>
    <S sid="200" ssid="41">.</S>
    <S sid="201" ssid="42">.from fit in with all other uses of save A laborious concordance analysis was undertaken to answer this question.</S>
    <S sid="202" ssid="43">When it was nearing completion, we noticed that the tags that we were inventing to capture the generalizations could in most cases have been suggested by looking at the lexical items listed in the association ratio table for save.</S>
    <S sid="203" ssid="44">For example, we had failed to notice the significance of time adverbials in our analysis of save, and no dictionary records this.</S>
    <S sid="204" ssid="45">Yet it should be rescuers who helped save the toddler[PERSON] from an abandoned well(LOCI will be feted with a parade while anempting to save two drowning boys[PERSONI from a turbulem[BAD] creek[LOC] m Ohio[LOC) member states to help save the PEC[INST] from possible bankruptcy[ECOM(RADI this pane. should be sought &amp;quot; to save the company[CORKINST]] from bankruptcy[ECONNBAD1. law was necessary to save the country(NATION[INSTE from disaster[BAD] . operation &amp;quot; to save the nation[NATION[INSTB from Communism[BADUOLITICALI were not needed to save the system from bankruptcy[ECON]tBADI . his efforts to save the world[lNST] from the likes of Lothar and the Spider Woman give them the money to save the dogs[ANIMAL] from being destroyed[DESTRUCT] , program intended to save the giant birds(ANIMAL] from ereinction[DESTRUCT] , UNCLASSIFIED (10 concordance lines) walnut and ash trees to save them from the axes and saws of a logging company. after the attack to save the ship from a terrible[BAD] fire , Navy reports concluded Thursday. certificates that would save shoppers[PERSON] anywhere from $50(MONEY1 [NUMBER] to $500[MONEY] [NU Figure 2 Some AP 1987 Concordance Lines to &amp;quot;save .</S>

    <S sid="207" ssid="48">More detailed inspection shows that the time adverbials correlate interestingly with just one group of save objects, namely those tagged [MONEY].</S>
    <S sid="208" ssid="49">The AP wire is full of discussions of saving $1.2 billion per month; computational lexicography should measure and record such patterns if they are general, even when traditional dictionaries do not.</S>
    <S sid="209" ssid="50">As another example illustrating how the association ratio tables would have helped us analyze the save concordance lines, we found ourselves contemplating the semantic tag ENV(IRONMENT) to analyze lines such as: the trend to save the forests [ENV] it's our turn to save the lake [ENV], joined a fight to save their forests [ENV], can we get busy to save the planet [ENV] ?</S>
    <S sid="210" ssid="51">If we had looked at the association ratio tables before labeling the 65 lines for save .</S>
    <S sid="211" ssid="52">.</S>

    <S sid="215" ssid="56">In fact, this pattern probably subsumes most of the occurrences of the &amp;quot;save [ANIMAL]&amp;quot; pattern noticed in Figure 2.</S>
    <S sid="216" ssid="57">Thus, these tables do not provide semantic tags, but they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags.</S>
    <S sid="217" ssid="58">It may be that everything said here about save and other words is true only of 1987 American journalese.</S>
    <S sid="218" ssid="59">Intuitively, however, many of the patterns discovered seem to be good candidates for conventions of general English.</S>
    <S sid="219" ssid="60">A future step would be to examine other more balanced corpora and test how well the patterns hold up.</S>

  <SECTION title="9 CONCLUSIONS" number="10">
    <S sid="220" ssid="1">We began this paper with the psycholinguistic notion of word association norm, and extended that concept toward the information theoretic definition of mutual information.</S>
    <S sid="221" ssid="2">This provided a precise statistical calculation that could be applied to a very large corpus of text to produce a table of associations for tens of thousands of words.</S>
    <S sid="222" ssid="3">We were then able to show that the table encoded a number of very interesting patterns ranging from doctor .</S>
    <S sid="223" ssid="4">.</S>
    <S sid="224" ssid="5">. nurse to save .</S>
    <S sid="225" ssid="6">.</S>
    <S sid="226" ssid="7">. from.</S>
    <S sid="227" ssid="8">We finally concluded by showing how the patterns in the association ratio table might help a lexicographer organize a concordance.</S>
    <S sid="228" ssid="9">In point of fact, we actually developed these results in basically the reverse order.</S>
    <S sid="229" ssid="10">Concordance analysis is still extremely labor-intensive and prone to errors of omission.</S>
    <S sid="230" ssid="11">The ways that concordances are sorted don't adequately support current lexicographic practice.</S>
    <S sid="231" ssid="12">Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word, often lexicographers actually use a second word such as from or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines.</S>
    <S sid="232" ssid="13">In other words, they use two words to triangulate in on a word sense.</S>
    <S sid="233" ssid="14">This triangulation approach clusters concordance lines together into word senses based primarily on usage (distributional evidence), as opposed to intuitive notions of meaning.</S>
    <S sid="234" ssid="15">Thus, the question of what is a word sense can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not address semantics (interpretation), even though the inventory of tags may appear to have semantic values.</S>
    <S sid="235" ssid="16">The triangulation approach requires &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; How does the lexicographer decide which potential cut points are &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; and which are merely due to chance?</S>
    <S sid="236" ssid="17">The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure that is often a fairly good approximation to the &amp;quot;art.&amp;quot; Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material, steadily improving consistency and productivity.</S>
    <S sid="237" ssid="18">But on the other hand, the objective score can be misleading.</S>
    <S sid="238" ssid="19">The score takes only distributional evidence into account.</S>
    <S sid="239" ssid="20">For example, the measure favors set .</S>
    <S sid="240" ssid="21">.</S>
    <S sid="241" ssid="22">. for over set .</S>
    <S sid="242" ssid="23">.</S>
    <S sid="243" ssid="24">. down; it doesn't know that the former is less interesting because its semantics are compositional.</S>
    <S sid="244" ssid="25">In addition, the measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess such as Church's parts program or Hindle's parser.</S>
    <S sid="245" ssid="26">Neither of these preprocesses, though, can help highlight the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; similarity between nouns such as picture and photograph.</S>
    <S sid="246" ssid="27">Although one might imagine a preprocess that would help in this particular case, there will probably always be a class of generalizations that are obvious to an intelligent lexicographer, but lie hopelessly beyond the objectivity of a computer.</S>
    <S sid="247" ssid="28">Despite these problems, the association ratio could be an important tool to aid the lexicographer, rather like an index to the concordances.</S>
    <S sid="248" ssid="29">It can help us decide what to look for; it provides a quick summary of what company our words do keep.</S>
