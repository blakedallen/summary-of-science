SemEval-2007 Task 19: Frame Semantic Structure Extraction
This task consists of recognizing words and phrases that evoke semantic frames as defined in the FrameNet project (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu), and their semantic dependents, which are usually, but not always, their syntactic dependents (including subjects).
The training data was FN annotated sentences.
In testing, participants automatically annotated three previously unseen texts to match gold standard (human) annotation, including predicting previously unseen frames and roles.
Precision and recall were measured both for matching of labels of frames and FEs and for matching of semantic dependency trees based on the annotation.
Our shared tasks shows that frame-semantic SRL of running text is a hard problem, partly due to the fact that running text is bound to contain many frames for which no or little annotated training data are available.
