A Program For Aligning Sentences In Bilingual Corpora
Researchers in both machine Iranslation (e.g., Brown et al., 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990) have recently become interested in studying parallel texts, texts such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings) which are available in multiple languages (French and English).
This paper describes a method for aligning sentences in these parallel texts, based on a simple statistical model of character lengths.
The method was developed and tested on a small trilingual sample of Swiss economic reports.
A much larger sample of 90 million words of Canadian Hansards has been aligned and donated to the ACL/DCI.
We extract pairs of anchor words such as numbers, proper nouns (organiziation, person, title), dates and monetary information.
We find that the byte length ratio of target sentence to source sentence is normally distributed.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of a global alignment dynamic program algorithm where the basic similarity score is based on the difference in sentence lengths, measured in characters.
