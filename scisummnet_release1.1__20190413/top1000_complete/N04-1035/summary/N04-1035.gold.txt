What's In A Translation Rule?
We propose a theory that gives formal semantics to word-level alignments defined over parallel corpora.
We use our theory to introduce a linear algorithm that can be used to derive from word-aligned, parallel corpora the minimal set of syntactically motivated transformation rules that explain human translation data.
We describe how to learn hundreds of millions of tree transformation rules from a parsed, aligned Chinese/English corpus, and we describe probability estimators for those rules.
Our translation rules are learned from word-aligned bilingual texts whose source side has been parsed by using a syntactic parser.
