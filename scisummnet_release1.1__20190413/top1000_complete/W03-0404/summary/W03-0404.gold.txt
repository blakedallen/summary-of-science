Learning Subjective Nouns Using Extraction Pattern Bootstrapping
We explore the idea of creating a subjectivity classifier that uses lists of subjective nouns learned by bootstrapping algorithms.
The goal of our research is to develop a system that can distinguish subjective sentences from objective sentences.
First, we use two bootstrapping algorithms that exploit extraction patterns to learn sets of subjective nouns.
Then we train a Naive Bayes classifier using the subjective nouns, discourse features, and subjectivity clues identified in prior research.
The bootstrapping algorithms learned over 1000 subjective nouns, and the subjectivity classifier performed well, achieving 77% recall with 81% precision.
We use manually derived pattern templates to extract subjective nouns by bootstrapping.
We mine subjective nouns from unannotated texts with two bootstrapping algorithms that exploit lexico-syntactic extraction patterns and manually-selected subjective seeds.
