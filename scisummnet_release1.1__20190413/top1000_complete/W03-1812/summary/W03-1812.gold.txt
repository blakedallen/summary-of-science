An Empirical Model Of Multiword Expression Decomposability
This paper presents a construction-inspecific model of multiword expression decomposability based on latent semantic analysis.
We use latent semantic analysis to determine the similarity between a multiword expression and its constituent words, and claim that higher similarities indicate greater decomposability.
We test the model over English noun-noun compounds and verb-particles, and evaluate its correlation with similarities and hyponymy values in WordNet.
Based on mean hyponymy over partitions of data ranked on similarity, we furnish evidence for the calculated similarities being correlated with the semantic relational content of WordNet.
we studied vector extraction for phrases because they were interested in the decomposability of multi word expressions.
we propose a LSA-based model for measuring the decomposability of MWEs by examining the similarity between them and their constituent words, with higher similarity indicating the greater decomposability.
