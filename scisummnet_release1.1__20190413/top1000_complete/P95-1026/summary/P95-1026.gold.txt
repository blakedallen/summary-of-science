Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation Rivaling Supervised Methods
This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm for sense disambiguation that, when trained on unannotated English text, rivals the performance of supervised techniques that require time-consuming hand annotations.
The algorithm is based on two powerful constraints - that words tend to have one sense per discourse and one sense per collocation - exploited in an iterative bootstrapping procedure.
Tested accuracy exceeds 96%.
We introduce the idea of sense consistency and extend it to operator across related documents.
We propose the self training, a semi-supervised algorithm which we apply do word sense disambiguation.
