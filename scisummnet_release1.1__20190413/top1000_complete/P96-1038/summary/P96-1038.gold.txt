A Prosodic Analysis Of Discourse Segments In Direction-Giving Monologues
This paper reports on corpus-based research into the relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure.
We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.
We also compare the acoustic-prosodic features of initial, medial, and final utterances in a discourse segment.
We find that speech is able to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues.
We introduce the Boston Directions Corpus, a publicly available speech corpora with manual ToBI annotations intended for experiments in automatic prosody labeling.
