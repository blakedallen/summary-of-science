A Maximum Entropy Word Aligner For Arabic-English Machine Translation
This paper presents a maximum entropy word alignment algorithm for Arabic-English based on supervised training data.
We demonstrate that it is feasible to create training material for problems in machine translation and that a mixture of supervised and unsupervised methods yields superior performance.
The probabilistic model used in the alignment directly mod-els the link decisions.
Significant improvement over traditional word alignment techniques is shown as well as improvement on several machine translation tests.
Performance of the algorithm is contrasted with human annotation performance.
We present a discriminatively trained 1-to-N model with feature functions specifically designed for Arabic.
We train a discriminative model on a corpus of ten thousand word aligned Arabic-English sentence pairs that outperforms a GIZA++ baseline.
