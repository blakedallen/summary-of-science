Weakly Supervised Learning for Hedge Classification in Scientific Literature
We investigate automatic classification of speculative language ('hedging'), in biomedical text using weakly supervised machine learning.
Our contributions include a precise description of the task with annotation guidelines, analysis and discussion, a probabilistic weakly supervised learning model, and experimental evaluation of the methods presented.
We show that hedge classification is feasible using weakly supervised ML, and point toward avenues for future research.
We use single words as input features in order to classify sentences from biological articles as speculative or non speculative.
We extend the work of Light et al (2004) by refining their annotation guidelines and creating a publicly available data set (FlyBase data set) for speculative sentence classification.
We find that our model is unsuccessful in identifying assertive statements of knowledge paucity which are generally marked rather syntactically than lexically.
