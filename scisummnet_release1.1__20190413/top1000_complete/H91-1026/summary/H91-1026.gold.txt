Identifying Word Correspondences In Parallel Texts
Motivated by the need to reduce on the memory requirement and to insure robustness in estimation of probability, we propose an alternative algorithm in which probabilities are not estimated and stored for all word pairs.
We propose a statistic to measure the strength of correlation between source and target words.
We use the phi2 statistics as the correspondence level of the word pairs and show that it was more effective than the mutual information.
