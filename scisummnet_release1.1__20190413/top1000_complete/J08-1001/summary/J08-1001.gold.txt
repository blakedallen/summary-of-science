Modeling Local Coherence: An Entity-Based Approach
This article proposes a novel framework for representing and measuring local coherence.
Central to this approach is the entity-grid representation of discourse, which captures patterns of entity distribution in a text.
The algorithm introduced in the article automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences and records distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities.
We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a learning task and show that our entity-based representation is well-suited for ranking-based generation and text classification tasks.
Using the proposed representation, we achieve good performance on text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment.
An entity grid is constructed for each document, and is represented as a matrix in which each row represents a sentence, and each column represents an entity.
We experiment on two datasets: news articles on the topic of earthquakes (Earthquakes) and narratives on the topic of aviation accidents (Accidents).
