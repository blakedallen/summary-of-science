Aligning A Parallel English-Chinese Corpus Statistically With Lexical Criteria
We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts.
Our report concerns three related topics: (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing the applicability of Gale and Church's (1991) length-based statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and (3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.
We find that the lengths of English and Chinese texts are not as highly correlated as in the French-English task, leading to lower success rates for length-based aligners.
