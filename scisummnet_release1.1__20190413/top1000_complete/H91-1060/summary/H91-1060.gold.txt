A Procedure For Quantitatively Comparing The Syntactic Coverage Of English Grammars
We define PARSEVAL measures for parsing: labelled precision, labelled recall, and labelled F-measure (Prec., Rec., and F1, respectively), which are based on the number of non-terminal items in the parser's output that match those in the gold-standard parse.
