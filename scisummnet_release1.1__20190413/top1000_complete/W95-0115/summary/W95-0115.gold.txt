Automatic Evaluation And Uniform Filter Cascades For Inducing N-Best Translation Lexicons
This paper shows how to induce an N-best translation lexicon from a bilingual text corpus using statistical properties of the corpus together with four external knowledge sources.
The knowledge sources are cast as filters, so that any subset of them can be cascaded in a uniform framework.
A new objective evaluation measure is used to compare the quality of lexicons induced with different filter cascades.
The best filter cascades improve lexicon quality by up to 137% over the plain vanilla statistical method, and approach human performance.
Drastically reducing the size of the training corpus has a much smaller impact on lexicon quality when these knowledge sources are used.
This makes it practical to train on small hand-built corpora for language pairs where large bilingual corpora are unavailable.
Moreover, three of the four filters prove useful even when used with large training corpora.
We use the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR) to measure similarity.
