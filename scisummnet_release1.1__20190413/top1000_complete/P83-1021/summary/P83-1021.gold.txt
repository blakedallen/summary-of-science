Parsing As Deduction
By exploring the relationship between parsing and deduction, a new and more general view of chart parsing is obtained, which encompasses parsing for grammar formalisms based on unification, and is the basis of the Earley Deduction proof procedure for definite clauses.
The efficiency of this approach for an interesting class of grammars is discussed.
We extend Earley deduction work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters.
We present versions of Earley's algorithm for unification grammars, in which unification is the sole operation responsible for attribute valuation.
