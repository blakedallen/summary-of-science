Assessing Agreement On Classification Tasks: The Kappa Statistic
Currently, computational linguists and cognitive scientists working in the area of discourse and dialogue argue that their subjective judgments are reliable using several different statistics, none of which are easily interpretable or comparable to each other.
Meanwhile, researchers in content analysis have already experienced the same difficulties and come up with a solution in the kappa statistic.
We discuss what is wrong with reliability measures as they are currently used for discourse and dialogue work in computational linguistics and cognitive science, and argue that we would be better off as afield adopting techniques from content analysis.
Our method, kappa statistic, is used extensively in empirical studies of discourse (Carletta, 1996).
