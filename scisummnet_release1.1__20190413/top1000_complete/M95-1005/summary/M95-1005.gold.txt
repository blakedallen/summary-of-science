A Model-Theoretic Coreference Scoring Scheme
This note describes a scoring scheme for the coreference task in MUC6.
It improves on the original approach l by: (1) grounding the scoring scheme in terms of a model ; (2) producing more intuitive recall and precision scores ; and (3) not requiring explicit computation of the transitive closure of coreference.
The principal conceptual difference is that we have moved from a syntactic scoring model based on following coreference links to an approach defined by the model theory of those links.
In brief, the scheme operates by comparing the equivalence classes defined by the links in the key and the response, rather than the links themselves (thus, this is only well defined for identity links, at the moment).
These classes are of course the models of the IDENT equivalence relation, and this strategy is preferable for a number of reasons, one being that the scores are independent of the particular links used to encode the equivalence relation.
The scores themselves are obtained by determining the minimal perturbations to the response that are required to transform its corresponding equivalence classes into those of the key.
Specifically, the recall (respectively precision) error terms are found by calculating the least number of links that need to be added to the respons e (respectively the key) in order to have the classes align.
Although at first blush this seems combinatorially explosive, due to references to minimal spanning subsets of the equivalence relation, it turns out it can be accomplished with a very simple counting scheme.
we introduce the link-based MUC evaluation metric for the MUC-6 and MUC 7 co reference tasks.
