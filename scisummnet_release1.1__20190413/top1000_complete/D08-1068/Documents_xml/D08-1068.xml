    <S sid="1" ssid="1">Machine learning approaches to coreference resolution are typically supervised, and require expensive labeled data.</S>
    <S sid="2" ssid="2">Some unsupervised approaches have been proposed (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007)), but they are less accurate.</S>
    <S sid="3" ssid="3">In this paper, we present the first unsupervised approach that is competitive with supervised ones.</S>
    <S sid="4" ssid="4">This is made possible by performing joint inference across mentions, in contrast to the pairwise classification typically used in supervised methods, and by using Markov logic as a representation language, which enables us to easily express relations like apposition and predicate nominals.</S>
    <S sid="5" ssid="5">On MUC and ACE datasets, our model outperforms Haghigi and Klein&#8217;s one using only a fraction of the training data, and often matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised models.</S>
  </ABSTRACT>
  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="6" ssid="1">The goal of coreference resolution is to identify mentions (typically noun phrases) that refer to the same entities.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="2">This is a key subtask in many NLP applications, including information extraction, question answering, machine translation, and others.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="3">Supervised learning approaches treat the problem as one of classification: for each pair of mentions, predict whether they corefer or not (e.g., McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005)).</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="4">While successful, these approaches require labeled training data, consisting of mention pairs and the correct decisions for them.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="5">This limits their applicability.</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="6">Unsupervised approaches are attractive due to the availability of large quantities of unlabeled text.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="7">However, unsupervised coreference resolution is much more difficult.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="8">Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s (2007) model, the most sophisticated to date, still lags supervised ones by a substantial margin.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="9">Extending it appears difficult, due to the limitations of its Dirichlet process-based representation.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="10">The lack of label information in unsupervised coreference resolution can potentially be overcome by performing joint inference, which leverages the &#8220;easy&#8221; decisions to help make related &#8220;hard&#8221; ones.</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="11">Relations that have been exploited in supervised coreference resolution include transitivity (McCallum &amp; Wellner, 2005) and anaphoricity (Denis &amp; Baldridge, 2007).</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="12">However, there is little work to date on joint inference for unsupervised resolution.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="13">We address this problem using Markov logic, a powerful and flexible language that combines probabilistic graphical models and first-order logic (Richardson &amp; Domingos, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="14">Markov logic allows us to easily build models involving relations among mentions, like apposition and predicate nominals.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="15">By extending the state-of-the-art algorithms for inference and learning, we developed the first general-purpose unsupervised learning algorithm for Markov logic, and applied it to unsupervised coreference resolution.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="16">We test our approach on standard MUC and ACE datasets.</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="17">Our basic model, trained on a minimum of data, suffices to outperform Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s (2007) one.</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="18">Our full model, using apposition and other relations for joint inference, is often as accurate as the best supervised models, or more.</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="19">We begin by reviewing the necessary background on Markov logic.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="20">We then describe our Markov logic network for joint unsupervised coreference resolution, and the learning and inference algorithms we used.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="21">Finally, we present our experiments and results.</S>

  <SECTION title="2 Related Work" number="2">
    <S sid="27" ssid="1">Most existing supervised learning approaches for coreference resolution are suboptimal since they resolve each mention pair independently, only imposing transitivity in postprocessing (Ng, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="2">Moreover, many of them break up the resolution step into subtasks (e.g., first determine whether a mention is anaphoric, then classify whether it is coreferent with an antecedent), which further forsakes opportunities for joint inference that have been shown to be helpful (Poon &amp; Domingos, 2007).</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="3">Using graph partitioning, McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005) incorporated transitivity into pairwise classification and achieved the state-of-the-art result on the MUC-6 dataset, but their approach can only leverage one binary relation at a time, not arbitrary relations among mentions.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="4">Denis &amp; Baldridge (2007) determined anaphoricity and pairwise classification jointly using integer programming, but they did not incorporate transitivity or other relations.</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="5">While potentially more appealing, unsupervised learning is very challenging, and unsupervised coreference resolution systems are still rare to this date.</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="6">Prior to our work, the best performance in unsupervised coreference resolution was achieved by Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), using a nonparametric Bayesian model based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="7">At the heart of their system is a mixture model with a few linguistically motivated features such as head words, entity properties and salience.</S>
    <S sid="34" ssid="8">Their approach is a major step forward in unsupervised coreference resolution, but extending it is challenging.</S>
    <S sid="35" ssid="9">The main advantage of Dirichlet processes is that they are exchangeable, allowing parameters to be integrated out, but Haghighi and Klein forgo this when they introduce salience.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="10">Their model thus requires Gibbs sampling over both assignments and parameters, which can be very expensive.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="11">Haghighi and Klein circumvent this by making approximations that potentially hurt accuracy.</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="12">At the same time, the Dirichlet process prior favors skewed cluster sizes and a number of clusters that grows logarithmically with the number of data points, neither of which seems generally appropriate for coreference resolution.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="13">Further, deterministic or strong non-deterministic dependencies cause Gibbs sampling to break down (Poon &amp; Domingos, 2006), making it difficult to leverage many linguistic regularities.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="14">For example, apposition (as in &#8220;Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;) suggests coreference, and thus the two mentions it relates should always be placed in the same cluster.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="15">However, Gibbs sampling can only move one mention at a time from one cluster to another, and this is unlikely to happen, because it would require breaking the apposition rule.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="16">Blocked sampling can alleviate this problem by sampling multiple mentions together, but it requires that the block size be predetermined to a small fixed number.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="17">When we incorporate apposition and other regularities the blocks can become arbitrarily large, making this infeasible.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="18">For example, suppose we also want to leverage predicate nominals (i.e., the subject and the predicating noun of a copular verb are likely coreferent).</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="19">Then a sentence like &#8220;He is Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft&#8221; requires a block of four mentions: &#8220;He&#8221;, &#8220;Bill Gates&#8221;, &#8220;the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;, and &#8220;Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="20">Similar difficulties occur with other inference methods.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="21">Thus, extending Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s model to include richer linguistic features is a challenging problem.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="22">Our approach is instead based on Markov logic, a powerful representation for joint inference with uncertainty (Richardson &amp; Domingos, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="23">Like Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s, our model is cluster-based rather than pairwise, and implicitly imposes transitivity.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="24">We do not predetermine anaphoricity of a mention, but rather fuse it into the integrated resolution process.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="25">As a result, our model is inherently joint among mentions and subtasks.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="26">It shares several features with Haghighi &amp; Klein&#8217;s model, but removes or refines features where we believe it is appropriate to.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="27">Most importantly, our model leverages apposition and predicate nominals, which Haghighi &amp; Klein did not use.</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="28">We show that this can be done very easily in our framework, and yet results in very substantial accuracy gains.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="29">It is worth noticing that Markov logic is also well suited for joint inference in supervised systems (e.g., transitivity, which took McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005) nontrivial effort to incorporate, can be handled in Markov logic with the addition of a single formula (Poon &amp; Domingos, 2008)).</S>

  <SECTION title="3 Markov Logic" number="3">
    <S sid="56" ssid="1">In many NLP applications, there exist rich relations among objects, and recent work in statistical relational learning (Getoor &amp; Taskar, 2007) and structured prediction (Bakir et al., 2007) has shown that leveraging these can greatly improve accuracy.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="2">One of the most powerful representations for joint inference is Markov logic, a probabilistic extension of first-order logic (Richardson &amp; Domingos, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="3">A Markov logic network (MLN) is a set of weighted first-order clauses.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="4">Together with a set of constants, it defines a Markov network with one node per ground atom and one feature per ground clause.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="5">The weight of a feature is the weight of the firstorder clause that originated it.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="6">The probability of a state x in such a network is given by P(x) = (1/Z) exp (Ez wzfz(x)), where Z is a normalization constant, wz is the weight of the ith clause, fz = 1 if the ith clause is true, and fz = 0 otherwise.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="7">Markov logic makes it possible to compactly specify probability distributions over complex relational domains.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="8">Efficient inference can be performed using MC-SAT (Poon &amp; Domingos, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="9">MC-SAT is a &#8220;slice sampling&#8221; Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="10">Slice sampling introduces auxiliary variables u that decouple the original ones x, and alternately samples u conditioned on x and viceversa.</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="11">To sample from the slice (the set of states x consistent with the current u), MC-SAT calls SampleSAT (Wei et al., 2004), which uses a combination of satisfiability testing and simulated annealing.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="12">The advantage of using a satisfiability solver (WalkSAT) is that it efficiently finds isolated modes in the distribution, and as a result the Markov chain mixes very rapidly.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="13">The slice sampling scheme ensures that detailed balance is (approximately) preserved.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="14">MC-SAT is orders of magnitude faster than previous MCMC algorithms like Gibbs sampling, making efficient sampling possible on a scale that was previAlgorithm 1 MC-SAT(clauses, weights, num samples) x(c) Satisfy(hard clauses) for i 1 to num samples do M 0 for all ck E clauses satisfied by x(z&#8722;1) do With probability 1 &#8212; e&#8722;lk add ck to M ously out of reach.</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="15">Algorithm 1 gives pseudo-code for MC-SAT.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="16">At iteration i &#8212; 1, the factor 0k for clause ck is either elk if ck is satisfied in x(z&#8722;1), or 1 otherwise.</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="17">MC-SAT first samples the auxiliary variable uk uniformly from (0, 0k), then samples a new state uniformly from the set of states that satisfy 0k &gt; uk for all k (the slice).</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="18">Equivalently, for each k, with probability 1 &#8212; e&#8722;lk the next state must satisfy ck.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="19">In general, we can factorize the probability distribution in any way that facilitates inference, sample the uk&#8217;s, and make sure that the next state is drawn uniformly from solutions that satisfy 0k &gt; uk for all factors.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="20">MC-SAT, like most existing relational inference algorithms, grounds all predicates and clauses, thus requiring memory and time exponential in the predicate and clause arities.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="21">We developed a general method for producing a &#8220;lazy&#8221; version of relational inference algorithms (Poon &amp; Domingos, 2008), which carries exactly the same inference steps as the original algorithm, but only maintains a small subset of &#8220;active&#8221; predicates/clauses, grounding more as needed.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="22">We showed that Lazy-MC-SAT, the lazy version of MC-SAT, reduced memory and time by orders of magnitude in several domains.</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="23">We use Lazy-MC-SAT in this paper.</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="24">Supervised learning for Markov logic maximizes the conditional log-likelihood L(x, y) = log P(Y = yJX = x), where Y represents the non-evidence predicates, X the evidence predicates, and x, y their values in the training data.</S>
    <S sid="80" ssid="25">For simplicity, from now on we omit X, whose values are fixed and always conditioned on.</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="26">The optimization problem is convex and a global optimum can be found using gradient descent, with the gradient being where ni is the number of true groundings of clause i.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="27">The expected count can be approximated as where yk are samples generated by MC-SAT.</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="28">To combat overfitting, a Gaussian prior is imposed on all weights.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="29">In practice, it is difficult to tune the learning rate for gradient descent, especially when the number of groundings varies widely among clauses.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="30">Lowd &amp; Domingos (2007) used a preconditioned scaled conjugate gradient algorithm (PSCG) to address this problem.</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="31">This estimates the optimal step size in each step as where g is the gradient, d the conjugate update direction, and A a parameter that is automatically tuned to trade off second-order information with gradient descent.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="32">H is the Hessian matrix, with the (i, j)th entry being The Hessian can be approximated with the same samples used for the gradient.</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="33">Its negative inverse diagonal is used as the preconditioner.1 The open-source Alchemy package (Kok et al., 2007) provides implementations of existing algorithms for Markov logic.</S>

  <SECTION title="4 An MLN for Joint Unsupervised Coreference Resolution" number="4">
    <S sid="93" ssid="1">In this section, we present our MLN for joint unsupervised coreference resolution.</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="2">Our model deviates from Haghighi &amp; Klein&#8217;s (2007) in several important ways.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="3">First, our MLN does not model saliences for proper nouns or nominals, as their influence is marginal compared to other features; for pronoun salience, it uses a more intuitive and simpler definition based on distance, and incorporated it as a prior.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="4">Another difference is in identifying heads.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="5">For the ACE datasets, Haghighi and Klein used the gold heads; for the MUC-6 dataset, where labels are not available, they crudely picked the rightmost token in a mention.</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="6">We show that a better way is to determine the heads using head rules in a parser.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="7">This improves resolution accuracy and is always applicable.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="8">Crucially, our MLN leverages syntactic relations such as apposition and predicate nominals, which are not used by Haghighi and Klein.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="9">In our approach, what it takes is just adding two formulas to the MLN.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="10">As common in previous work, we assume that true mention boundaries are given.</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="11">We do not assume any other labeled information.</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="12">In particular, we do not assume gold name entity recognition (NER) labels, and unlike Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), we do not assume gold mention types (for ACE datasets, they also used gold head words).</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="13">We determined the head of a mention either by taking its rightmost token, or by using the head rules in a parser.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="14">We detected pronouns using a list.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="15">The main query predicate is InClust(m, c!</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="16">), which is true iff mention m is in cluster c. The &#8220;t!&#8221; notation signifies that for each m, this predicate is true for a unique value of c. The main evidence predicate is Head(m, t!</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="17">), where m is a mention and t a token, and which is true iff t is the head of m. A key component in our MLN is a simple head mixture model, where the mixture component priors are represented by the unit clause InClust(+m, +c) and the head distribution is represented by the head prediction rule All free variables are implicitly universally quantified.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="18">The &#8220;+&#8221; notation signifies that the MLN contains an instance of the rule, with a separate weight, for each value combination of the variables with a plus sign.</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="19">By convention, at each inference step we name each non-empty cluster after the earliest mention it contains.</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="20">This helps break the symmetry among mentions, which otherwise produces multiple optima and makes learning unnecessarily harder.</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="21">To encourage clustering, we impose an exponential prior on the number of non-empty clusters with weight &#8722;1.</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="22">The above model only clusters mentions with the same head, and does not work well for pronouns.</S>
    <S sid="115" ssid="23">To address this, we introduce the predicate IsPrn(m), which is true iff the mention m is a pronoun, and adapt the head prediction rule as follows: This is always false when m is a pronoun, and thus applies only to non-pronouns.</S>
    <S sid="116" ssid="24">Pronouns tend to resolve with mentions that are semantically compatible with them.</S>
    <S sid="117" ssid="25">Thus we introduce predicates that represent entity type, number, and gender: Type(x, e!</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="26">), Number(x, n!</S>
    <S sid="119" ssid="27">), Gender(x, g!</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="28">), where x can be either a cluster or mention, e E {Person,Organization,Location,Other}, n E {Singular,Plural} and g E {Male, Female, Neuter}.</S>
    <S sid="121" ssid="29">Many of these are known for pronouns, and some can be inferred from simple linguistic cues (e.g., &#8220;Ms.</S>
    <S sid="122" ssid="30">Galen&#8221; is a singular female person, while &#8220;XYZ Corp.&#8221; is an organization).3 Entity type assignment is represented by the unit clause Type(+x, +e) and similarly for number and gender.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="31">A mention should agree with its cluster in entity type.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="32">This is ensured by the hard rule (which has infinite weight and must be satisfied) InClust(m, c) ==&gt; (Type(m, e) &lt;---&gt; Type(c, e)) 3We used the following cues: Mr., Ms., Jr., Inc., Corp., corporation, company.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="33">The proportions of known properties range from 14% to 26%.</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="34">There are similar hard rules for number and gender.</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="35">Different pronouns prefer different entity types, as represented by which only applies to pronouns, and whose weight is positive if pronoun t is likely to assume entity type e and negative otherwise.</S>
    <S sid="128" ssid="36">There are similar rules for number and gender.</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="37">Aside from semantic compatibility, pronouns tend to resolve with nearby mentions.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="38">To model this, we impose an exponential prior on the distance (number of mentions) between a pronoun and its antecedent, with weight &#8722;1.4 This is similar to Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s treatment of salience, but simpler.</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="39">Syntactic relations among mentions often suggest coreference.</S>
    <S sid="132" ssid="40">Incorporating such relations into our MLN is straightforward.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="41">We illustrate this with two examples: apposition and predicate nominals.</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="42">We introduce a predicate for apposition, Appo(x, y), where x, y are mentions, and which is true iff y is an appositive of x.</S>
    <S sid="135" ssid="43">We then add the rule Appo(x, y) ==&gt; (InClust(x, c) &lt;---&gt; InClust(y, c)) which ensures that x, y are in the same cluster if y is an appositive of x.</S>
    <S sid="136" ssid="44">Similarly, we introduce a predicate for predicate nominals, PredNom(x, y), and the corresponding rule.5 The weights of both rules can be learned from data with a positive prior mean.</S>
    <S sid="137" ssid="45">For simplicity, in this paper we treat them as hard constraints.</S>
    <S sid="138" ssid="46">We also consider a rule-based system that clusters non-pronouns by their heads, and attaches a pronoun to the cluster which has no known conflicting type, number, or gender, and contains the closest antecedent for the pronoun.</S>
    <S sid="139" ssid="47">This system can be encoded in an MLN with just four rules.</S>
    <S sid="140" ssid="48">Three of them are the ones for enforcing agreement in type, number, and gender between a cluster and its members, as defined in the base MLN.</S>
    <S sid="141" ssid="49">The fourth rule is With a large but not infinite weight (e.g., 100), this rule has the effect of clustering non-pronouns by their heads, except when it violates the hard rules.</S>
    <S sid="142" ssid="50">The MLN can also include the apposition and predicate-nominal rules.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="51">As in the base MLN, we impose the same exponential prior on the number of non-empty clusters and that on the distance between a pronoun and its antecedent.</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="52">This simple MLN is remarkably competitive, as we will see in the experiment section.</S>

    <S sid="160" ssid="16">Such predicates can be viewed as multi-valued predicates (e.g., Head(m) with value ranging over all c&#8217;s) and are prevalent in NLP applications.</S>
    <S sid="161" ssid="17">We adapted SampleSAT to flip two or more atoms in each step so that the unique-value constraints are automatically satisfied.</S>
    <S sid="162" ssid="18">By default, MC-SAT treats each ground clause as a separate factor while determining the slice.</S>
    <S sid="163" ssid="19">This can be very inefficient for highly correlated clauses.</S>
    <S sid="164" ssid="20">For example, given a non-pronoun mention m currently in cluster c and with head t, among the mixture prior rules involving m InClust(m, c) is the only one that is satisfied, and among those head-prediction rules involving m, &#172;IsPrn(m)&#8743;InClust(m, c)&#8743;Head(m, t) is the only one that is satisfied; the factors for these rules multiply to = exp(wm, + wm,&#65533;,t), where wm,r is the weight for InClust(m, c), and wm,&#65533;,t is the weight for &#172;IsPrn(m) &#8743; InClust(m, c) &#8743; Head(m, t), since an unsatisfied rule contributes a factor of e0 = 1.</S>
    <S sid="165" ssid="21">We extended MC-SAT to treat each set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive rules as a single factor.</S>
    <S sid="166" ssid="22">E.g., for the above m, MC-SAT now samples u uniformly from (0, 0), and requires that in the next state 0' be no less than u. Equivalently, the new cluster and head for m should satisfy wm,c, + wm,c,,t, &gt; log(u).</S>
    <S sid="167" ssid="23">We extended SampleSAT so that when it considers flipping any variable involved in such constraints (e.g., c or t above), it ensures that their new values still satisfy these constraints.</S>
    <S sid="168" ssid="24">The final clustering is found using the MaxWalkSAT weighted satisfiability solver (Kautz et al., 1997), with the appropriate extensions.</S>
    <S sid="169" ssid="25">We first ran a MaxWalkSAT pass with only finite-weight formulas, then ran another pass with all formulas.</S>
    <S sid="170" ssid="26">We found that this significantly improved the quality of the results that MaxWalkSAT returned.</S>

    <S sid="171" ssid="1">We implemented our method as an extension to the Alchemy system (Kok et al., 2007).</S>
    <S sid="172" ssid="2">Since our learning uses sampling, all results are the average of five runs using different random seeds.</S>
    <S sid="173" ssid="3">Our optimization problem is not convex, so initialization is important.</S>
    <S sid="174" ssid="4">The core of our model (head mixture) tends to cluster non-pronouns with the same head.</S>
    <S sid="175" ssid="5">Therefore, we initialized by setting all weights to zero, and running the same learning algorithm on the base MLN, while assuming that in the ground truth, nonpronouns are clustered by their heads.</S>
    <S sid="176" ssid="6">(Effectively, the corresponding InClust atoms are assigned to appropriate values and are included in Y rather than Z during learning.)</S>
    <S sid="177" ssid="7">We used 30 iterations of PSCG for learning.</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="8">(In preliminary experiments, additional iterations had little effect on coreference accuracy.)</S>
    <S sid="179" ssid="9">We generated 100 samples using MC-SAT for each expectation approximation.6 We conducted experiments on MUC-6, ACE-2004, and ACE Phrase-2 (ACE-2).</S>
    <S sid="180" ssid="10">We evaluated our systems using two commonly-used scoring programs: MUC (Vilain et al., 1995) and B3 (Amit &amp; Baldwin, 1998).</S>
    <S sid="181" ssid="11">To gain more insight, we also report pairwise resolution scores and mean absolute error in the number of clusters.</S>
    <S sid="182" ssid="12">The MUC-6 dataset consists of 30 documents for testing and 221 for training.</S>
    <S sid="183" ssid="13">To evaluate the contribution of the major components in our model, we conducted five experiments, each differing from the previous one in a single aspect.</S>
    <S sid="184" ssid="14">We emphasize that our approach is unsupervised, and thus the data only contains raw text plus true mention boundaries.</S>
    <S sid="185" ssid="15">MLN-1 In this experiment, the base MLN was used, and the head was chosen crudely as the rightmost token in a mention.</S>
    <S sid="186" ssid="16">Our system was run on each test document separately, using a minimum of training data (the document itself).</S>
    <S sid="187" ssid="17">MLN-30 Our system was trained on all 30 test documents together.</S>
    <S sid="188" ssid="18">This tests how much can be gained by pooling information.</S>
    <S sid="189" ssid="19">MLN-H The heads were determined using the head rules in the Stanford parser (Klein &amp; Manning, 2003), plus simple heuristics to handle suffixes such as &#8220;Corp.&#8221; and &#8220;Inc.&#8221; MLN-HA The apposition rule was added.</S>
    <S sid="190" ssid="20">MLN-HAN The predicate-nominal rule was added.</S>
    <S sid="191" ssid="21">This is our full model.</S>
    <S sid="192" ssid="22">We also compared with two rule-based MLNs: RULE chose the head crudely as the rightmost token in a mention, and did not include the apposition rule and predicate-nominal rule; RULE-HAN chose the head using the head rules in the Stanford parser, and included the apposition rule and predicate-nominal rule.</S>
    <S sid="193" ssid="23">Past results on ACE were obtained on different releases of the datasets, e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007) used the ACE-2004 training corpus, Ng (2005) and Denis and Baldridge (2007) used ACE Phrase-2, and Culotta et al. (2007) used the ACE2004 formal test set.</S>
    <S sid="194" ssid="24">In this paper, we used the ACE-2004 training corpus and ACE Phrase-2 (ACE2) to enable direct comparisons with Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), Ng (2005), and Denis and Baldridge (2007).</S>
    <S sid="195" ssid="25">Due to license restrictions, we were not able to obtain the ACE-2004 formal test set and so cannot compare directly to Culotta et al. (2007).</S>
    <S sid="196" ssid="26">The English version of the ACE-2004 training corpus contains two sections, BNEWS and NWIRE, with 220 and 128 documents, respectively.</S>
    <S sid="197" ssid="27">ACE-2 contains a training set and a test set.</S>
    <S sid="198" ssid="28">In our experiments, we only used the test set, which contains three sections, BNEWS, NWIRE, and NPAPER, with 51, 29, and 17 documents, respectively.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="6.3 Results" number="7">
    <S sid="199" ssid="1">Table 1 compares our system with previous approaches on the MUC-6 dataset, in MUC scores.</S>
    <S sid="200" ssid="2">Our approach greatly outperformed Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), the state-of-the-art unsupervised system.</S>
    <S sid="201" ssid="3">Our system, trained on individual documents, achieved an F1 score more than 7% higher than theirs trained on 60 documents, and still outperformed it trained on 381 documents.</S>
    <S sid="202" ssid="4">Training on the 30 test documents together resulted in a significant gain.</S>
    <S sid="203" ssid="5">(We also ran experiments using more documents, and the results were similar.)</S>
    <S sid="204" ssid="6">Better head identification (MLN-H) led to a large improvement in accuracy, which is expected since for mentions with a right modifier, the rightmost tokens confuse rather than help coreference (e.g., &#8220;the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;).</S>
    <S sid="205" ssid="7">Notice that with this improvement our system already outperforms a state-of-theart supervised system (McCallum &amp; Wellner, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="206" ssid="8">Leveraging apposition resulted in another large improvement, and predicate nominals also helped.</S>
    <S sid="207" ssid="9">Our full model scores about 9% higher than Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), and about 6% higher than McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005).</S>
    <S sid="208" ssid="10">To our knowledge, this is the best coreference accuracy reported on MUC-6 to date.7 The B3 scores of MLN-HAN on the MUC-6 dataset are 77.4 (precision), 67.6 (recall) and 72.2 (F1).</S>
    <S sid="209" ssid="11">(The other systems did not report B3.)</S>
    <S sid="210" ssid="12">Interestingly, the rule-based MLN (RULE) sufficed to outperform Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), and by using better heads and the apposition and predicate-nominal rules (RULE-HAN), it outperformed McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005), the supervised system.</S>
    <S sid="211" ssid="13">The MLNs with learning (MLN-30 and MLN-HAN), on the other hand, substantially outperformed the corresponding rule-based ones.</S>
    <S sid="212" ssid="14">Table 2 compares our system to Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007) on the ACE-2004 training set in MUC scores.</S>
    <S sid="213" ssid="15">Again, our system outperformed theirs by a large margin.</S>
    <S sid="214" ssid="16">The B3 scores of MLN-HAN on the ACE2004 dataset are 71.6 (precision), 68.4 (recall) and 70.0 (F1) for BNEWS, and 75.7 (precision), 69.2 (recall) and 72.3 (F1) for NWIRE.</S>
    <S sid="215" ssid="17">(Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007) did not report B3.)</S>
    <S sid="216" ssid="18">Due to license restrictions, we could not compare directly to Culotta et al. (2007), who reported overall B3-F1 of 79.3 on the formal test set.</S>
    <S sid="217" ssid="19">Tables 3 and 4 compare our system to two recent supervised systems, Ng (2005) and Denis &amp; Baldridge (2007).</S>
    <S sid="218" ssid="20">Our approach significantly outperformed Ng (2005).</S>
    <S sid="219" ssid="21">It tied with Denis &amp; Baldridge (2007) on NWIRE, and was somewhat less accurate on BNEWS and NPAPER.</S>
    <S sid="220" ssid="22">Luo et al. (2004) pointed out that one can obtain a very high MUC score simply by lumping all mentions together.</S>
    <S sid="221" ssid="23">B3 suffers less from this problem but is not perfect.</S>
    <S sid="222" ssid="24">Thus we also report pairwise resolution scores (Table 5), the gold number of clusters, and our mean absolute error in the number of clusters (Table 6).</S>
    <S sid="223" ssid="25">Systems that simply merge all mentions will have exceedingly low pairwise precision (far below 50%), and very large errors in the number of clusters.</S>
    <S sid="224" ssid="26">Our system has fairly good pairwise precisions and small mean error in the number of clusters, which verifies that our results are sound.</S>
    <S sid="225" ssid="27">Many of our system&#8217;s remaining errors involve nominals.</S>
    <S sid="226" ssid="28">Additional features should be considered to distinguish mentions that have the same head but are different entities.</S>
    <S sid="227" ssid="29">For pronouns, many remaining errors can be corrected using linguistic knowledge like binding theory and salience hierarchy.</S>
    <S sid="228" ssid="30">Our heuristics for identifying appositives and predicate nominals also make many errors, which often can be fixed with additional name entity recognition capabilities (e.g., given &#8220;Mike Sullivan, VOA News&#8221;, it helps to know that the former is a person and the latter an organization).</S>
    <S sid="229" ssid="31">The most challenging case involves phrases with different heads that are both proper nouns (e.g., &#8220;Mr.</S>
    <S sid="230" ssid="32">Bush&#8221; and &#8220;the White House&#8221;).</S>
    <S sid="231" ssid="33">Handling these cases requires domain knowledge and/or more powerful joint inference.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="7 Conclusion" number="8">
    <S sid="232" ssid="1">This paper introduces the first unsupervised coreference resolution system that is as accurate as supervised systems.</S>
    <S sid="233" ssid="2">It performs joint inference among mentions, using relations like apposition and predicate nominals.</S>
    <S sid="234" ssid="3">It uses Markov logic as a representation language, which allows it to be easily extended to incorporate additional linguistic and world knowledge.</S>
    <S sid="235" ssid="4">Future directions include incorporating additional knowledge, conducting joint entity detection and coreference resolution, and combining coreference resolution with other NLP tasks.</S>
