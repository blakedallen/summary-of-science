HHMM-Based Chinese Lexical Analyzer ICTCLAS
This document presents the results from Inst. of Computing Tech., CAS in the ACL SIGHAN-sponsored First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off.
The authors introduce the unified HHMM-based frame of our Chinese lexical analyzer ICTCLAS and explain the operation of the six tracks.
Then provide the evaluation results and give more analysis.
Evaluation on ICTCLAS shows that its performance is competitive.
Compared with other system, ICTCLAS has ranked top both in CTB and PK closed track.
In PK open track, it ranks second position.
ICTCLAS BIG5 version was transformed from GB version only in two days; however, it achieved well in two BIG5 closed tracks.
Through the first bakeoff, we could learn more about the development in Chinese word segmentation and become more confident on our HHMM-based approach.
At the same time, we really find our problems during the evaluation.
The bakeoff is interesting and helpful.
