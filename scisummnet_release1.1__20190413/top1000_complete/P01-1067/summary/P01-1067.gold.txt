A Syntax-Based Statistical Translation Model
We present a syntax-based statistical translation model.
Our model transforms a source-language parse tree into a target-language string by applying stochastic operations at each node.
These operations capture linguistic differences such as word order and case marking.
Model parameters are estimated in polynomial time using an EM algorithm.
The model produces word alignments that are better than those produced by IBM Model 5.
We use a parser in the target language to train probabilities on a set of 609 operations that transform a target parse tree into a source string.
We present an algorithm for estimating probabilistic parameters for a model which represents translation as a sequence of re-ordering operations over children of nodes in a syntactic tree, using automatic parser output for the initial tree structures.
