Using the parallel dataset formed by Simple English Wikipedia (SWKP) 1 and traditional EnglishWikipedia (EWKP) 2, more recent work has focused on developing machine learning approaches to sentence simplification. Zhu et al (2010) constructed a parallel corpus (PWKP) of 108,016/114,924complex/simple sentences by aligning sentences from EWKPandSWKP and used the resulting bi text to train a simplification model inspired by syntax-based ma chine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001) .Their simplification model encodes the probabilities for four rewriting operations on the parse tree of an input sentences namely, substitution, re ordering, splitting and deletion",
