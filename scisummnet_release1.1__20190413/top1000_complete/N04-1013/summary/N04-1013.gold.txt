Speed And Accuracy In Shallow And Deep Stochastic Parsing
This paper reports some experiments that compare the accuracy and performance of two stochastic parsing systems.
The currently popular Collins parser is a shallow parser whose output contains more detailed semantically relevant information than other such parsers.
The XLE parser is a deep-parsing system that couples a Lexical Functional Grammar to a log-linear disambiguation component and provides much richer representations theory.
We measured the accuracy of both systems against a gold standard of the PARC 700 dependency bank, and also measured their processing times.
We report high parsing speeds for a deep parsing system which uses an LFG grammar: 1.9 sentences per second for 560 sentences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank.
