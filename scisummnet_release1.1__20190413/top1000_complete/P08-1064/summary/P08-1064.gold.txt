A Tree Sequence Alignment-based Tree-to-Tree Translation Model
This paper presents a translation model that is based on tree sequence alignment, where a tree sequence refers to a single sequence of subtrees that covers a phrase.
The model leverages on the strengths of both phrase-based and linguistically syntax-based method.
It automatically learns aligned tree sequence pairs with mapping probabilities from word-aligned biparsed parallel texts.
Compared with previous models, it not only captures non-syntactic phrases and discontinuous phrases with linguistically structured features, but also supports multi-level structure reordering of tree typology with larger span.
This gives our model stronger expressive power than other reported models.
Experimental results on the NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English translation task show that our method statistically significantly outperforms the baseline systems.
Our method generates all possible tree fragments rooted by each node in the source parse tree or forest, and then matches all the generated tree fragments against the source parts (left hand side) of translation rules to extract the useful rules.
