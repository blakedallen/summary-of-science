The Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0.
We present the second version of the Penn Discourse Treebank, PDTB-2.0, describing its lexically-grounded annotations of discourse relations and their two abstract object arguments over the 1 million word Wall Street Journal corpus.
We describe all aspects of the annotation, including (a) the argument structure of discourse relations, (b) the sense annotation of the relations, and (c) the attribution of discourse relations and each of their arguments.
We list the differences between PDTB-1.0 and PDTB-2.0.
We present representative statistics for several aspects of the annotation in the corpus.
we present The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) ,such a corpus which provides a discourse-level annotation on top of the Penn Treebank, following a predicate argument approach (Webber, 2004).
