Methods For The Qualitative Evaluation Of Lexical Association Measures
This paper presents methods for a qualitative, unbiased comparison of lexical association measures and the results we have obtained for adjective-noun pairs and preposition-noun-verb triples extracted from German corpora.
In our approach, we compare the entire list of candidates, sorted according to the particular measures, to a reference set of manually identified "true positives".
We also show how estimates for the very large number of hapaxlegomena and double occurrences can be inferred from random samples.
We extract German PP-verb combinations from a chunk-parsed version of the Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus.
We use four collocation measures: Point-wise mutual information (PMI); T-Score; log-likelihood; and the raw frequency of N1 N2 in the corpus.
The t-test measure, which, of all standard measures, yields the best results in general-language collocation extraction studies.
