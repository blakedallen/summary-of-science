Improved Statistical Machine Translation Using Paraphrases
Parallel corpora are crucial for training SMT systems.
However, for many language pairs they are available only in very limited quantities.
For these language pairs a huge portion of phrases encountered at run-time will be unknown.
We show how techniques from paraphrasing can be used to deal with these otherwise unknown source language phrases.
Our results show that augmenting a state-of-the-art SMT system with paraphrases leads to significantly improved coverage and translation quality.
For a training corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs we increase the coverage of unique test set unigrams from 48% to 90%, with more than half of the newly covered items accurately translated, as opposed to none in current approaches.
We propose a novel method which substitutes a paraphrase for an unknown source word or phrase in the input sentence and then proceeds to use the translation of that paraphrase in the production of the target-language result.
