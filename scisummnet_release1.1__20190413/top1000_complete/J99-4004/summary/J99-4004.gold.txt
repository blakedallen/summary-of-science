Semiring Parsing
We synthesize work on parsing algorithms, deductive parsing, and the theory of algebra applied to formal languages into a general system for describing parsers.
Each parser performs abstract computations using the operations of a semiring.
The system allows a single, simple representation to be used for describing parsers that compute recognition, derivation forests, Viterbi, n-best, inside values, and other values, simply by substituting the operations of different semirings.
We also show how to use the same representation, interpreted differently, to compute outside values.
The system can be used to describe a wide variety of parsers, including Earley's algorithm, tree adjoining grammar parsing, Graham Harrison Ruzzo parsing, and prefix value computation.
We show how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds of information about the input.
We augment such logic programs with semiring weights, giving an algebraic explanation for the intuitive connections among classes of algorithms with the same logical structure.
