  <S sid="16" ssid="16">Often it is just a ntatter of relative implausibility: tile only reason why a certain iarerpmtarion of a sentence is not perceived, is that aanther interprctatilm is much more plausible.</S>

  <S sid="19" ssid="19">But the preferences language users have m the case of ambiguous entences, are paradigm instances of perfonatmce phenomena.</S>
  <S sid="20" ssid="20">In order to build effective lauguage processing systems we nmst intplement performanec-grammars, rather than competence gratumars, qlaese performance granmuus houM not only contain information on the structural possibilities of file general I~mgnage system, but also on details of actual language use in a language conmmnity, and of tile language experiences of an individual, which cause this individual to have certain expectations on what kinds of uUerances are going to occur, and what slractures and interpretations these utterances are going to have.</S>
  <S sid="21" ssid="21">Therc is all alternative linguistic tradition tluat has always focused on the concrete details of actual language use: file statistical tradition.</S>
  <S sid="22" ssid="22">In this approach, syntactic structure is usually ignored; only superficial stalistical properties of a large coqms are described: file probability that a certain word is followed by a certain other word, the probability that a certain sequence of two words is followed by a ce~ml word, etc.</S>

  <S sid="25" ssid="25">It will be clear that this approach is not suitable for mmly other tasks, because no uotion of syntactic structme is used.</S>
  <S sid="26" ssid="26">Aud there are statistical dependencies within the sentences of a corpus, that cam extend over all arbitrarily long sequence of words; this is ignored by file Markov-approach.</S>

  <S sid="30" ssid="30">NAN rES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 The Synthesis of Syntax and Statistics The idea that a synthesis between syntactic and statistical approaches could be useful has incidentally been proposed before, but has not been worked out very well so far.</S>
  <S sid="31" ssid="31">The only technical elaboration of this idea that exists at the moment, the notion of a probabilisdc gtamnmr, is of a rather simplistic nature.</S>
  <S sid="32" ssid="32">A probabilistic grammar is simply a juxtaposition of the most fundamental syntactic notion and the most fundamental statistical notion: it is an "old-fashioned" context free grammar, that describes syntactic structures by means of a set of abstract rewrite rules that are now provided with probabilities that correspond to the application- probabilities of the rules (see e.g.</S>
  <S sid="33" ssid="33">[Jeliuek 1990]).</S>
  <S sid="34" ssid="34">As long as a probabilistic grammar only assigns probabilities to individual rewrite rules, the grammar cannot account for all statistical properties of a language corpus.</S>
  <S sid="35" ssid="35">It is, for instance, not possible to indicate how the probability of syntactic structures or lexical items depends on their syntacticflexical context.</S>
  <S sid="36" ssid="36">As a consequence of this, it is not possible to recognize frequent phrases and figures of speech as such - a disappointing property, for one would prefer that such phrases and figures of speech would get a high priority in the ranking of the possible syntactic analyses of a sentence.</S>
  <S sid="37" ssid="37">Some improvements can be made by applying the Markov-approach to rewrite rules, as is found in the work of [Salomaa 1969] and [Magerman 1991].</S>
  <S sid="38" ssid="38">Nevertheless, any approach which ties probabilities to rewrite rules will never be able to acconunodate all statistical dependencies.</S>
  <S sid="39" ssid="39">Optimal statistical estimations can only be achieved if tile statistics are applied to different kinds of units than rewrite rules.</S>
  <S sid="40" ssid="40">It is interesting to note that also in the field of theoretical linguistics tile necessity to use other kinds of structural units has been put forward.</S>
  <S sid="41" ssid="41">The clearest articulation of this idea is found in the work of [Fillmore 1988].</S>
  <S sid="42" ssid="42">From a linguistic point of view that emphasizes the syntactic complexities caused by idiomatic and semi-idiomatic expressions, Fillmore et al.</S>
  <S sid="43" ssid="43">arrive at the proposal to describe language not by means of a set of rewrite rules, but by meaus of a set of constructions.</S>
  <S sid="44" ssid="44">A construction is a tree-strncture: a fragment of a constituent-structure that can comprise more than one level.</S>
  <S sid="45" ssid="45">This tree is labeled with syntactic, semantic and pragnmtic ategories and feature-values.</S>
  <S sid="46" ssid="46">Lexical items can be specified as part of a construction.</S>
  <S sid="47" ssid="47">Constructions can be idiomatic in nature: the meaning of a larger constituent can be specified without being constructed front the meanings of its sub-constituents.</S>
  <S sid="48" ssid="48">Fillmores ideas still show the influence of the tradition of formal grammars: the constructions are schemata, and the combinatorics of putting the constructions together looks very much like a context free gramnmr.</S>
  <S sid="49" ssid="49">But the way in which Filhnore generalizes the notion of grmnmar resolves the problems we found in the current statistical grammars: if a constrnction-granunar is combined with statistical notions it is perhaps possible to represent all statistical information.</S>
  <S sid="50" ssid="50">This is one of the central ideas behind our approach.</S>
  <S sid="51" ssid="51">A New Approach: Data Oriented Parsing The starting-point of our approach is the idea indicated above, that when a human language user analyzes sentences, there is a strong preference for the recognition of sentences, constituents and patterns that occurred before in the experience of the language user.</S>
  <S sid="52" ssid="52">There is a statistical component in language processing that prefers more frequent structures and interpretations to less frequently perceived alternatives.</S>
  <S sid="53" ssid="53">The information we ideally would like to use in order to model the language performance uf a natural language user, comprises therefore an enumeration f all lexical items and syntactic/semantic structures ever experieaced by the language user, with their frequency of occurrence.</S>
  <S sid="54" ssid="54">In practice this means: a very large corpus of sentences with their syntactic analyses and semantic interpretatious.</S>
  <S sid="55" ssid="55">Every senteace comprises a large number of constructions: not only the whole sentence and all its constituents, but also the patterns that can be abstracted from the analyzed sentence by introducing free variables for lexical elements or complex constituents.</S>
  <S sid="56" ssid="56">Parsing then does not happen by applying grammatical rules to rite input sentence, but by constructing an optinml analogy between the input sentence and as many corpus sentences ,as possible.</S>
  <S sid="57" ssid="57">Sometimes the system shall need to abstract away from most of the properties of the trees in the corpus, and sometimes a part of tile input is found literally in the corpus, and can be treated as one unit in the parsing process.</S>
  <S sid="58" ssid="58">Thus the system tries to combine constructions from the corpus so as to reconstruct the input sentence as well as possible.</S>
  <S sid="59" ssid="59">~llte preferred parse out of all parses of the input sentence is obtained by maximizing file conditional probability of a parse given the sentence.</S>
  <S sid="60" ssid="60">Finally, the preferred parse is added to the corpus, bringing it into a new state.</S>
  <S sid="61" ssid="61">To illustrate the basic idea, consider the following extremely simple exmnple.</S>
  <S sid="62" ssid="62">Assume that the whole corpus consists of only the following two trees: S A M: VP A Wa V NP .~.</S>

  <S sid="97" ssid="97">In [Scholtes 1992] a neural net implementation f DOP is proposed, ltere we will show that conventional rule- based parsing strategies can be applied tn DOP, by converting constructions into rules.</S>
  <S sid="98" ssid="98">A construction Can be seen as a production rule, where the lefthand-side of the rule is constituted by the root of rite construction and the righthand-side is constituted by the leaves of the construction.</S>
  <S sid="99" ssid="99">The only exmt condition is that of every such rule its corresponding construction should be remembered in order to generate a parse-tree for the input string (by composing the constructions that correspond to the rules ilmt are applied).</S>
  <S sid="100" ssid="100">For a construction t, the corresponding production rule is given by root(t) ~ leaves(O In order to calculate the pteterredparse of an input string by maximizing the conditional probability, all parses with all possible tuples of constructions must be generated, which becomes highly inefficient.</S>
  <S sid="101" ssid="101">Often we are not interested in all parses of an alnbiguous input string, neither in their exact probabilities, but only in which parse is the preferred parse.</S>
  <S sid="102" ssid="102">Thus we would like to have a strategy fllat estimates file top of the probability hierarchy of parses.</S>
  <S sid="103" ssid="103">"llais call be achieved by using Monte Carlo techniques (see e.g.</S>
  <S sid="104" ssid="104">[Hammersley 1964]): we estimate the preferred parse by taking random samples frotn the space of possibilities.</S>
  <S sid="105" ssid="105">This will give us a more effective approach dian exhaustively calculating the probabilities.</S>
  <S sid="106" ssid="106">Discussion Although DOP has not yet been tested thoroughly 2, we call already predict sonic of its capabilities.</S>
  <S sid="107" ssid="107">In DOP, the probability of a parse depends on all tuples of coustructious that generate that parse.</S>
  <S sid="108" ssid="108">~lhe more different ways in which a parse can be generated, the lligher its probability.</S>
  <S sid="109" ssid="109">This implies that a parse which can (also) be generated by relatively large constructions is favoured over a parse which can only be generated by relatively small constructions.</S>
  <S sid="110" ssid="110">This means that prepositiotml pluase attxichments arid figures of speech can be processed adequately by I)OP.</S>
  <S sid="111" ssid="111">As 1o the problem of hmguage acquisition, this ntight seem problematic for DOP: with all "already analyzed corpus, only adult language behaviour can be simulated.</S>
  <S sid="112" ssid="112">The problem of language acquisition is itt our perspective the problem of the acquisition of an initial corpus, in which non-linguistic input and pragmatics should play na important role.</S>
  <S sid="113" ssid="113">An additional remark should be devoted here to formal granlmars and disambiguation.</S>
  <S sid="114" ssid="114">Much work has been done to extend rule-based granunars with selectional restrictions such that the explosion of ambiguities is constrabled considerably, llowever, to represent semantic and pragmatic onstraints i a very expensive task.</S>
  <S sid="115" ssid="115">No one has ever succeeded in doing so except in relatively small grammars.</S>
  <S sid="116" ssid="116">Furthermore, a basic question renmins as to whether it is possible to formally etlcode all of die syntactic, semantic alld pragmatic infomlation needed for disambiguation.</S>
  <S sid="117" ssid="117">In DOP, the additional infornmtion that one can draw from a corpus of hand-marked structural annotations i that one can by-pass the necessity for modelling world knowledge, since this will autonmtically enter into the disarnbiguation of structures by Imnd.</S>
  <S sid="118" ssid="118">Extracting constructions from these structures, and combining them in the most probable way, taking into account all possible statistical dependencies between them, preserves this world knowledge in the best possible way.</S>
  <S sid="119" ssid="119">In conclusion, it may be interesting to note that our idea of using past lallguage xperiences instead of rules, has much in cormnon with Stichs ideas about language ([Stich 1971]).</S>
  <S sid="120" ssid="120">lu Stichs view, judgements of gralnmaticality are not determined by applying a precompiled set of gratmuar rules, but rather have the character of a perceptual judgement on the question to what extent rite judged sentonce lotiks like the sentences the language user has in his head as examples of granlmaticality.</S>
  <S sid="121" ssid="121">The cot)crete language xperiences of file past of a language user determine how a new utterance is processed; there is no evidence for file assumption that past language experiences are generalized into a consistent heory that defines the 2 Corpora that will be used to lust DOP, mcude tile Tosca Corpus, built at the University of Nijmugen, and possibly the Penn Trcebm~k, built at the Umversity of Pennsylvania.</S>
