Offline Strategies For Online Question Answering: Answering Questions Before They Are Asked
Recent work in Question Answering has focused on web-based systems that extract answers using simple lexico-syntactic patterns.
We present an alternative strategy in which patterns are used to extract highly precise relational information offline, creating a data repository that is used to efficiently answer questions.
We evaluate our strategy on a challenging subset of questions, i.e. “Who is …” questions, against a state of the art web-based Question Answering system.
Results indicate that the extracted relations answer 25% more questions correctly and do so three orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art system.
We use part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involving proper nouns.
The precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise.
