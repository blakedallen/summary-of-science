Experiments With A Multilanguage Non-Projective Dependency Parser
We present a deterministic classifier-based Shift/Reduce parser.
We develop DeSR, an incremental deterministic classifier-based parser.
We propose a transition system whose individual transitions can deal with non-projective dependencies only to a limited extent, depending on the distance in the stack of the nodes involved in the newly constructed dependency.
