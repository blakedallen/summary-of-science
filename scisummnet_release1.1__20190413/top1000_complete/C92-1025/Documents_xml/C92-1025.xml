  <S sid="1" ssid="1">Limitations of "Kimmo" systems The advent of two-level morphology (Koskenniemi [1], Karttunen [2], Antworth [3], Ritchie et al.</S>
  <S sid="2" ssid="2">[4]) has made it relatively easy to develop adequate morphological (or at least morphographical) descriptions for natural languages, clearly superior to earlier "cut-and-paste" approaches tomor- phology.</S>
  <S sid="3" ssid="3">Most of the existing "Kimmo" systems developed within this paradigm consist of ?</S>
  <S sid="4" ssid="4">linked lexicons stored as annotated letter trees ?</S>
  <S sid="5" ssid="5">morphological information on the leaf nodes of trees ?</S>
  <S sid="6" ssid="6">transducers that encode morphological alternations An analysis of an inflected word form is produced by mapping the input form to a sequence of lexical forms through the transducers and by composing some out- put from the annotations on the leaf nodes of the lexical paths that were traversed.</S>
  <S sid="7" ssid="7">Comprehensive morphological descrip- tions of this type have been developed for several languages including Finnish, Swedish, Russian, English, Swahili, and Arabic.</S>
  <S sid="8" ssid="8">Although they have several good features, these Kimmo-systems also have some limitations.</S>
  <S sid="9" ssid="9">The ones we want to ad- dress in this paper are the following: (1) Lexical representations tend to be arbitrary.</S>
  <S sid="10" ssid="10">Because it is difficult to write and test two-level systems that map between pairs of radically dissimilar forms, lexical representations i  existing two-level analyzers tend to stay close to the surface forms.</S>
  <S sid="11" ssid="11">This is not a problem for morpho- logically simple languages like English because, for most words, inflected forms are very similar to the canonical dictionary entry.</S>
  <S sid="12" ssid="12">Except for a small number of irregular verbs and nouns, it is not difficult to create a two-level description for English in which lexical forms coincide with the canonical citation forms found in a dictionary.</S>
  <S sid="13" ssid="13">However, current analyzers for mor- phologically more complex languages (Finnish and Russian, for example) are not as satisfying in this respect.</S>
  <S sid="14" ssid="14">In these systems, lexical forms typically contain diacritic markers and special symbols; they are not real words in the language.</S>
  <S sid="15" ssid="15">For example, in Finnish the lexical counterpart of otin I took might be rendered as otTallln, where T, al, and I1 are an arbitrary encoding of morpho- logical alternations that determine the allomorphs of the stem and the past tense morpheme.</S>
  <S sid="16" ssid="16">The canonical citation form ottaa to take is composed from annotations on the leaf nodes of the letter trees that are linked to match the input.</S>
  <S sid="17" ssid="17">It is not in any direct way related to the lexical form produced by the transducers.</S>
  <S sid="18" ssid="18">(2) Morphological categories are not directly encoded as part of the lexical form.</S>
  <S sid="19" ssid="19">Instead of morphemes like Plural or Past, we typically see suffix strings like +s, and +ed, which do not by themselves indi- cate what morpheme they express.</S>
  <S sid="20" ssid="20">Different realizations of the same morpho- logical category are often represented as different even on the lexical side.</S>
  <S sid="21" ssid="21">These characteristics lead to some un- desirable consequences: ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~ 1992 1 4 1 PROC.</S>

  <S sid="23" ssid="23">Generation is more cumbersome and less eff ic ient than analysis.</S>
  <S sid="24" ssid="24">Because the information about morphological cate- gories is available only on the leaf nodes of the trees, many paths through the struc- ture may have to be tried before the right one is found.</S>
  <S sid="25" ssid="25">Some ways around this problem have been invented (Barton [5]) but in practice their use is limited.</S>
  <S sid="26" ssid="26">Annotated letter trees cannot be min imized .</S>
  <S sid="27" ssid="27">Although letter trees, anno- tated with morphological information, are a kind of finite-state network, they cannot be minimized because all the information associated with the leaf nodes would get lost when the branching tails are merged.</S>
  <S sid="28" ssid="28">The approach that we describe in this paper overcomes these problems and al- lows a representation f morphological in- formation that maps more easily to the representation found in traditional lexi- cons.</S>
  <S sid="29" ssid="29">On this basis we have constructed morphological nalyzers for English and French (with Carol Neidle) at Xerox PARC.</S>

  <S sid="31" ssid="31">0 serves here as the epsilon symbol.</S>
  <S sid="32" ssid="32">Because there is no need to have other annotations on the lexicon trees, problems I and II in Section 1 have been eliminated.</S>
  <S sid="33" ssid="33">Lexical forms are always sequences ofmorphemes in their canonical representation.</S>
  <S sid="34" ssid="34">The only obstacle to this approach is that the rules that constrain the surface realization of lexical forms become more difficult o write when there is little or no similarity between the two levels of repre- sentation.</S>
  <S sid="35" ssid="35">Designing such rules and under- standing their interactions i  a hard task even with the computational ssistance provided by a complete compiler for the two-level formalism (Karttunen et al.</S>
  <S sid="36" ssid="36">We follow two simple principles: (1) Inflected forms of the same word are mapped to the same canonical dictio- nary form.</S>
  <S sid="37" ssid="37">This applies to both regular and irregular forms.</S>
  <S sid="38" ssid="38">For example, in our English analyzer the surface forms happier and better are directly matched with the lexical forms happy and good, respectively, rather than some nonwords.</S>
  <S sid="39" ssid="39">As the distance between lexical and sur- face form increases, the mapping is easier to describe by allowing one or more intermediate l vels of representation.</S>
  <S sid="40" ssid="40">The solution we adopted combines the two- level rule formalism with the cascade model of finite-state morphology dis- cussed by Kaplan &amp; Kay [7].</S>
  <S sid="41" ssid="41">Composition oftwo-level rules (2) Morphological categories are repre- sented as part of the lexical form.</S>
  <S sid="42" ssid="42">Instead of encoding morphological categories such as Plural, Comparative, lstPerson as annota- tions on strings that realize them, we in- clude them directly in the lexical represen- tation.</S>
  <S sid="43" ssid="43">Consequently, our two-level repre- sentation of happier and better are: AcrF.s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao0r 1992 1 4 2 Our formal understanding of finite-state morpho logy  is based on the demonstrations that both rewriting rules and two-level rules denote regular relations on strings (Kaplan [9]).</S>
  <S sid="44" ssid="44">The correspondence b tween regular elations and finite-state transducers and the closure properties of regular relations provide the computat iona l  and mathematical tools that our approach depends on.</S>
  <S sid="45" ssid="45">One of the earliest results of finite-state morphology is the observation PROC.</S>
  <S sid="46" ssid="46">OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 that regular relations are closed under composition (Johnson [8], Kaplan&amp;Kay [7], Kaplan [9]).</S>
  <S sid="47" ssid="47">Consequently, a single transducer can be constructed whose behavior is exactly the same as a set of transducers arranged in an ordered feeding cascade: lexical string lexical string T composite intermediate string transducer surface string surface string Figure 2 This observation was originally made about transducers corresponding to phonological rewrite rules, but it applies to regular relations or transducers no matter how they are specified.</S>
  <S sid="48" ssid="48">Although regular elations in general are not closed under intersection, the subclass of relations denoted by standard two-level rules is closed under this operation (Kaplan [9]).</S>
  <S sid="49" ssid="49">Thus fstl and fst2 in Figure 2 may represent either a single two- level rule or the intersection of any number of rules.</S>
  <S sid="50" ssid="50">When the relationship between lexical and surface forms is complex, the descrip- tive task of setting up rules that relate the two levels can be simplified by decompos- ing the complex relation to a series of less opaque matches.</S>
  <S sid="51" ssid="51">For efficient recognition and generation, the resulting cascade can be reduced to a single transducer.</S>
  <S sid="52" ssid="52">Al- though it would be possible in principle to produce the same single transducer directly from two-level rules, we have found many cases in our descriptions of English and French where the composition approach is not only easier but also ACRES DECOLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ^ O,3T 1992 linguistically more justified.</S>
  <S sid="53" ssid="53">We describe one such case in detail.</S>
  <S sid="54" ssid="54">French compound plurals French plurals can be formed in a vari- ety of ways.</S>
  <S sid="55" ssid="55">Some of the most common patterns are illustrated in Figure 3.</S>
  <S sid="56" ssid="56">We omit here the actual two-level rules; what Figure 3 illustrates i  simply the joint effect of several rules that con- strain the realization of the plural mor- pheme and the shape of the stern in regu- lar nouns.</S>
  <S sid="57" ssid="57">Note that the constraints here are local; the stem and the plural morpheme are in a fixed position with respect to each other.</S>

  <S sid="59" ssid="59">OF COLING-92, NANTEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 only the last is.</S>
  <S sid="60" ssid="60">The possible patterns and some examples are given in Figure 4.</S>
  <S sid="61" ssid="61">The interesting cases are those in which the first part needs to be pluralized.</S>
  <S sid="62" ssid="62">In a simple two-level system, the information about plural formation summarized in Figure 3 would have to be rewritten and adapted so that the rules could apply over a. distance in the position just before the hyphen.</S>
  <S sid="63" ssid="63">No plural marking at all un je-ne-sais-quai a certain something des je-ne-sais-quoi Plural marking on the first compound un chef-doeuvre masterpiece des chefs-doeuvre Plural marking on the second compound une mini-jupe mini-skirt des mini-jupes Plural marking on both compounds une porte-fen~tre French window des portes-fen~tres Figure 4 The simple rules for regular plural for- mation illustrated in Figure 3 do not work for first parts of compounds because the affected elements are not in the same con- figuration relative to each other.</S>
  <S sid="64" ssid="64">Although it is possible to modify the rules, the new versions would be rather complicated and do not capture the simple fact that the plu- rals portes and fen~tres in portes-fen~tres in themselves are regular, the only thing that is special about the word is that plurality is expressed in both parts of the com- pound.</S>
  <S sid="65" ssid="65">We avoid these complications by creat- ing a cascade of two-level rules in which the first stage is only concerned with the plurals of compounds.</S>
  <S sid="66" ssid="66">It starts from a lexi- cal form in which the words are marked for the pattern that they take and creates an intermediate level in which the information about number and gender is distributed over the agreeing parts.</S>
  <S sid="67" ssid="67">This is illustrated in Figure 5 for the masculine plural of social-ddmocrate, a word in which both parts get pluralized.</S>

  <S sid="69" ssid="69">The second layer of rules applies uni- formly to simple nouns as well as com- pounds.</S>
  <S sid="70" ssid="70">In the case at hand, the two plu- rals in sociaux-ddmocrates are realized in the regular way, as shown in Figure 6. sociau 0 x -d~mocrate  0 s Figure 6 By first intersecting the rules in each set and then composing the results in the way shown in Figure 2, we end up with a transducer that eliminates the intermedi- ate level altogether and maps the lexical representation directly to the correct sur- face form, and vice versa.</S>

  <S sid="74" ssid="74">AUG. 23-28, 1992 The representation in Figure 7 fulfills the desiderata l id out in Section 2 except that it contains a special diacritic +DPL that marks the behavior of social-ddmocrate, with respect o plural formation.</S>
  <S sid="75" ssid="75">In the next section, we show how that diacritic can be eliminated.</S>
  <S sid="76" ssid="76">Composition with the lexicon By choosing the canonical dictionary form as the lexical form in our English and French analyzers and by including mor- phological categories directly as part of that representation, we have eliminated the need for additional annotations in the lexical structure that are common in exist- ing Kimmo systems.</S>
  <S sid="77" ssid="77">We can treat he letter tree as a simple finite-state network in which all morphological information is carried on the branches of the tree and not on the leaves.</S>
  <S sid="78" ssid="78">Taking this idea one step further, we may think of the lexicon as a trivial first stage in a cascade of transducers that maps between the lexical and the surface levels.</S>
  <S sid="79" ssid="79">The second stage is the two-level rule sys- tem.</S>
  <S sid="80" ssid="80">In the case of our analyzers for English and French, the rule system starts out with three levels but reduces to two by intersection and composition.</S>
  <S sid="81" ssid="81">The final stage is the composition of the rule system with the lexicon.</S>

  <S sid="87" ssid="87">Ac~s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOOT 1992 Stage 1 consists of two parallel two- level rule systems arranged in a cascade, as illustrated in Section 4.</S>
  <S sid="88" ssid="88">In Stage 2, the rules on each level have been intersected to a single transducer.</S>
  <S sid="89" ssid="89">Stage 3 shows the composition of the two-level rule systems to a single transducer and Stage 4 repre- sents the final result: a transducer that maps sequences of canonical dictionary forms and morphological categories to the corresponding surface forms, and vice versa.</S>
  <S sid="90" ssid="90">Although the conceptual picture is 1 4 5 P~oc.</S>
  <S sid="91" ssid="91">oF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 quite straightforward, the actual com- putations to produce the structures can be resource intensive, in some cases quite impractical.</S>
  <S sid="92" ssid="92">At the last stage, when the idiosyncratic behavior of particular lexical items has been taken into account in the composition of the lexicon with the rule transducers, all morphological diacritics such as the +DPL tag for French nouns with double plurals can be el iminated because the rules that depend on them have been applied.</S>
  <S sid="93" ssid="93">In full compliance with our desiderata in Section 2, the resulting transducer maps, among other  th ings,  social-ddmocrate+masc+pl directly to sociaux-ddmocrates, and vice versa.</S>
  <S sid="94" ssid="94">Discussion Finite-state morphology tests on the ob- servation that ordinary morphological al- ternations involve regular elations.</S>
  <S sid="95" ssid="95">This is the basis of the early work by Kaplan and Kay [7] on convert ing ordered rewrite rules to a cascade of transducers and the parallel transducers of Koskenniemis two- level model [1].</S>
  <S sid="96" ssid="96">In recent times the two- level model has been more popular.</S>
  <S sid="97" ssid="97">It has turned out (Karttunen [10]) that parallel two-level constraints are even expressive enough to account for phenomena that require rule order ing in the classical phonological rule formalism.</S>
  <S sid="98" ssid="98">But there is no computational or theoretical reason to insist on two-level descriptions.</S>
  <S sid="99" ssid="99">Because the mathematical properties of rewrite and two-level rules are now well-understood (Kaplan [9], Ritchie [11]), we can compose any n-level description to just two levels.</S>
  <S sid="100" ssid="100">In our work on English and French mor- phology we came across many instances in which the introduction of an extra level is both practical and linguistically motivated.</S>
  <S sid="101" ssid="101">The case of French compound plurals is a typical example.</S>
  <S sid="102" ssid="102">Our success in composing the rule sys- tem with the lexicon (Stage 4 in Figure 8) is due to a number of fortunate characteris- tics that morphological alternations and lexicons of natural anguages eem to have even though they are not necessary or even probable from a formal point of view.</S>
  <S sid="103" ssid="103">We at least were surprised by some of our results.</S>
  <S sid="104" ssid="104">The most important  of these delightful discoveries are: (1) Small case studies can be mis- leading.</S>
  <S sid="105" ssid="105">The composition of a rule trans- ducer against a lexicon containing a hand- ful of words is so much larger than the input lexicon that one is tempted to con- clude that the method can never succeed on a large scale.</S>
  <S sid="106" ssid="106">However,  this b lowup seems not to occur when the lexicon is already large.</S>
  <S sid="107" ssid="107">(2) Intersections and compositions of rule transducers tend to be large, but not nearly as large as they might be.</S>
  <S sid="108" ssid="108">The result of intersecting a few dozen two- level rules may have thousands or tens of thousands of states, but not trillions as the worst case scenario predicts.</S>
  <S sid="109" ssid="109">Many rules tend to apply either in quite similar or in quite different environments.</S>
  <S sid="110" ssid="110">The finite state machinery can represent such pat- terns without multiplying state sets.</S>
  <S sid="111" ssid="111">(3) Composit ion with the lexicons reduces the complexity of rule inter- actions.</S>
  <S sid="112" ssid="112">It might  turn out that the composit ion of a large lexicon with an even larger rule transducer is bigger than either one of the input structures.</S>
  <S sid="113" ssid="113">In reality, the size of the result seems to be somewhere  in the middle.</S>
  <S sid="114" ssid="114">The rules constrain the realization of all possible lexical forms.</S>
  <S sid="115" ssid="115">In the composition, their scope is restricted to just the forms that actually exist in the language.</S>
  <S sid="116" ssid="116">It turns out that this restriction makes the  result smaller ather than larger even though the lexicon itself is a very irregular collection of forms.</S>
  <S sid="117" ssid="117">The fact that it is possible to construct a lexical transducer for the whole language raises interesting theoretical issues.</S>
  <S sid="118" ssid="118">In lin- guistics it is commonly assumed that lexi- AcrEs BE COLING-92, NANTES, 23.28 AOUT 1992 1 4 6 PROC.</S>
  <S sid="119" ssid="119">OF COLING-92, N^NTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 cal entries and the rules for realizing them exist independently from one another.</S>
  <S sid="120" ssid="120">That assumption is, of course, also the starting point of the work that we are re- porting about in this paper.</S>
  <S sid="121" ssid="121">The initial separation between the lexicon and the rules is useful in constructing a system for word recognition and generation.</S>
  <S sid="122" ssid="122">The rules are, in a sense, a decomposition f a very complex mapping between lexical and surface forms to a set of simpler ela- tions that we can comprehend and ma- nipulate.</S>
  <S sid="123" ssid="123">But in the construction of the fi- nal result individual rules and the distinct lexicon disappear.</S>
  <S sid="124" ssid="124">The rules play no role at all in the actual generation and recognition process.</S>
  <S sid="125" ssid="125">They are needed only for the pur- pose of enlarging the lexicon, although other acquisition methods can be envi- sioned.</S>
  <S sid="126" ssid="126">The rules are true generalizations about the two-level exicon constructed with them but they are not a part of it.</S>
  <S sid="127" ssid="127">In linguistics the psychological reality of rules is often taken to be established by the observation that a simple listing of all forms would be not only implausible but even impossible, given that the brain must have some storage limitations.</S>
  <S sid="128" ssid="128">The general organization of the system like the one we have described suggests that the role of rules might be quite different.</S>
  <S sid="129" ssid="129">Instead of being essential for the production and comprehension f speech, the rules that linguists are trying to discover may be--if they exist in the mind at all--only sec- ondary reflections on the generalizations that can be encoded in the finite-state l xi- cal structure itself.</S>

  <S sid="172" ssid="172">Les syst6mes Kimmo standard se composent dun lexique en forme darborescence de caract6res (trie) avec des sommets finals annot6s dinformation morphologique et un ensemble de transducteurs qui transcrivent les representations lexicales en formes fl6chies.</S>
  <S sid="173" ssid="173">Bienque ces syst~mes soient sup6rieurs aux techniques an- t6rieures danalyse morphologique "cut- and-paste", ils ont un certain hombre de d6savantages: les formes lexicales sont souvent arbitraires et diff6rentes des lemmes dun dictionnaire normal; lana- lyse morphologique nest pas encod6e directement dans la forme lexicale.</S>
  <S sid="174" ssid="174">Le r6sultat est que la synth~se st souvent plus ardue que ianalyse t que les struc- tures ne sont pas optimales.</S>
  <S sid="175" ssid="175">Les analyseurs morphologiques con- struits a Xerox-PARC pour le franqais et langlais se basent sur deux principles simples: 1. les formes fl6chies dun m6me mot se basent sur un m6me lemme; 2. les cat6gories morphologiques font partie int6grante de la forme lexicale.</S>
  <S sid="176" ssid="176">Ainsi les formes lexicales sont toujours des s6quences de morphemes.</S>
  <S sid="177" ssid="177">Il est difficile dachever ces deux r6sultats d6sirables dans le cadre dune description classique/~ deux niveaux parce que la distance ntre les formes lexicales et les formes de surface est longue t tr6s difficile a d6crire avec un seul ensemble de r6gles phonologiques deux niveaux.</S>
  <S sid="178" ssid="178">I1 est possible de r6soudre ces probl6mes en exploitant dune faqon plus approfondie l s principes de la phonologie deux niveaux.</S>
  <S sid="179" ssid="179">En guise dexemple, larticle d6crit une cascade de r~gles deux niveaux qui permet une description simple du pluriel des mots compos6s en franqais.</S>
  <S sid="180" ssid="180">La premi6re serie de r6gles insure des annotations de nombre et de genre apr6s chaque 61ement de mots /~ pluriel double (social-ddmocrate ~ sociaux-ddmo- crates), la s6conde s6rie de ri~gles d6termine la r6alisation du nombre t du genre r6quise par les racines.</S>
  <S sid="181" ssid="181">Les caract6ristiques math6matiques des transducteurs r6guliers ont bien connues.</S>
  <S sid="182" ssid="182">Elles permettent la combinaison de trans- ducteurs correspondant a des syst6mes de r6gles a deux niveaux par composition et par intersection.</S>
  <S sid="183" ssid="183">Ainsi il est possible de r6duire un syst~me ~niveaux multiples un seul transducteur qui contr61e simul- tan6ment toutes les alternances morpho- logiques dun langue.</S>
  <S sid="184" ssid="184">Vu que dans les lexiques anglais et franqais d6velopp6s Xerox toute linformation morphologique est cod6e directement avec le lemme, il est possible daller plus loin et de composer le lexique entier avec les r6gles.</S>
  <S sid="185" ssid="185">Le trans- ducteur r6sultant, un lexique a deux niveaux, transcrit les formes lexicales directement en formes de surface et vice versa.</S>
  <S sid="186" ssid="186">Les r~gles ne sont utilis6es que dans la phase de construction.</S>
  <S sid="187" ssid="187">Lanalyse t la synth~se ne font usage que du trans- ducteur lexical r6sultant.</S>
