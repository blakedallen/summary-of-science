11001 New Features for Statistical Machine Translation
We use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm of Crammer et al. to add a large number of new features to two machine translation systems: the Hiero hierarchical phrase-based translation system and our syntax-based translation system.
On a large-scale Chinese-English translation task, we obtain statistically significant improvements of +1.5 Bleu and +1.1 Bleu, respectively.
We analyze the impact of the new features and the performance of the learning algorithm.
We only use 100 most frequent words for word context feature.
We introduce the features for an SCFG model for Chinese/English translation are of two types: The first type explicitly counters overestimates of rule counts, or rules with bad overlap points, bad rewrites, or with undesired insertions of target-side terminals.
