Word Sense And Subjectivity
Subjectivity and meaning are both important properties of language.
This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.
We study the distinction between objectivity and subjectivity in each different sense of a word, and their empirical effects in the context of sentiment analysis.
We provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation.
We show that even reliable subjectivity clues have objective senses.
We show that subjectivity annotations can be helpful for word sense disambiguation when a word has distinct subjective senses and objective senses.
We conduct a study on human annotation of 354 words senses with polarity and report a high inter-annotator agreement.
We define subjective expressions as words and phrases being used to express mental and emotional states, such as speculations, evaluations, sentiments, and beliefs.
