			<S sid="6" ssid="6">In this paper, we address the problem of word alignments for a bilingual corpus.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">In the recent years, there have been a number of papers con- sidering this or similar problems: (Brown et al, 1990), (Dagan et al, 1993), (Kay et al, 1993), (Fung et al, 1993).</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">In our approach, we use a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) (aelinek, 1976), which is similar, but not identical to those used in speech recognition.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">The key component of this approach is to make the alignment probabilities dependent not on the absolute position of the word align- ment, but on its relative position; i.e. we consider the differences in the index of the word positions rather than the index itself.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">The organization of the paper is as follows.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">After reviewing the statistical approach to ma- chine translation, we first describe the convention- al model (mixture model).</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">We then present our first-order HMM approach in lull detail.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">Finally we present some experimental results and compare our model with the conventional model.</S>

			<S sid="14" ssid="1">The goal is the translation of a text given in some language F into a target language E. For conve- nience, we choose for the following exposition as language pair French and English, i.e. we are giv- en a French string f~ = fx ...fj...fJ, which is to be translated into an English string e / = el...ei...cl. Among all possible English strings, we will choose the one with the highest probability which is given by Bayes' decision rule: a{ = argmax{P,.(c{lAa)} q = argmax {Pr(ejt) . l ' r ( f  le\[)} el ~ Pr(e{) is the language model of the target lan- guage, whereas Pr(fJle{) is the string translation model.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="2">The argmax operation denotes the search problem.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="3">In this paper, we address the problem of introducing structures into the probabilistic de- pendencies in order to model the string translation probability Pr(f~ le{).</S>

	<SECTION title="Al ignment Models. " number="3">
			<S sid="17" ssid="1">A key issne in modeling the string translation probability Pr(J'~le I) is the question of how we define the correspondence b tween the words of the English sentence and the words of the French sentence.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="2">In typical cases, we can assume a sort of pairwise dependence by considering all word pairs (fj, ei) for a given sentence pair I.-/1\[~'J', elqlj' We fur- ther constrain this model by assigning each French word to exactly one English word.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="3">Models describ- ing these types of dependencies are referred to as alignment models.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="4">In this section, we describe two models for word alignrnent in detail: ,.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="5">a mixture-based alignment model, which was introduced in (Brown et al, 1990); ? an HMM-based alignment model.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="6">In this paper, we address the question of how to define specific models for the alignment probabil- ities.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="7">The notational convention will be as fol- lows.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="8">We use the symbol Pr(.)</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="9">to denote general 836 probability distributions with (nearly) no Sl)eeitic asSUml)tions.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="10">In contrast, for modcl-t)ased prol)-- ability distributions, we use the generic symbol v(.).</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="11">3.1 Al ignment w i th M ix ture D is t r i |mt ion.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="12">Here, we describe the mixture-based alignment model in a fornmlation which is different fronl the original formulation ill (Brown el, a\[., 1990).</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="13">We will ,is(: this model as reference tbr the IIMM- based alignments to lie 1)resented later.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="14">The model is based on a decomposition of the joint probability \[br ,l'~ into a product over the probabilities for each word J): a j=l wheFe~ fo\[' norll-la\]iz;i, t on 17(~/SOllS~ the 8elltC\]\[ce length probability p(J\] l) has been included.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="15">The next step now is to assutne a sort O\['l,airwise inter- act, ion between tim French word f j an(l each, F,n- glish word ci, i = 1, ... l . These dep('ndencies are captured in the lbrm of a rnixtnre distritmtion: 1 p(J)le{) = ~_.p(i, fjlc I) i=1 I = ~_~p(ilj, l).p(fjle~) i=1 Putting everything together, we have the following mixture-based ntodel: J l r,'(fi!l~I) = p(JIO ' H ~_~ \[~,(ilJ, l).</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="16">~,(j)led\] (1) j= l i=t with the following ingredients: ? sentence length prob~d)ility: P(J l l); ? mixture alignment probability: p( i l j , I); ? translation probM)ility: p(f\[e).</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="17">Assuming a tmifornl ~flignment prol)ability 1 .p(ilj, 1) = 7 we arrive at the lh'st model proposed t)y (Brown et al, 1990).</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="18">This model will be referred to as IB M 1 model.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="19">To train the translation probabilities p(J'fc), we use a bilingual (;orpus consisting of sentence pairs \[:/ ';4"1 : ', . , s Using the ,,laxin,ul , like- lihood criterion, we ol)tain the following iterative L a equation (Brown et al, 1990): / ) ( f ie) = ~ - will, $' A(f,e) = ~ 2 ~5(f,J).~) }~ a(e,e~.~) For unilbrm alignment probabilities, it can be shown (Brown et al, 1990), that there is only one optinnnn and therefore the I,',M algorithm (Baum, 1!)72) always tinds the global optimum.</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="20">For mixture alignment model with nonunilbrm alignment probabilities (subsequently referred to as IBM2 model), there ~tre to() many alignrnent parameters Pill j , I) to be estimated for smMl co l pora.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="21">Therefore, a specific model tbr tile Mign- ment in:obabilities i used: r ( i - j~- ) (~) p( i l j , 1) = l . I E i ' : l "( it --" J J-) This model assumes that the position distance rel- ative to the diagonal ine of the (j, i) plane is the dominating factor (see Fig.</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="22">1).</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="23">'lb train this mod- el, we use the ,naximutn likelihood criterion in the so-called ulaximmn al)proximation, i.e. the likeli- hood criterion covers only tile most lik(-.ly align: inch, rather than the set of all alignm(,nts: d P,'(f(I,:I) ~ I I ~"IU HO, ~)v(J} I,:~)\] (a) j=l In training, this criterion amounts to a sequence of iterations, each of which consists of two steps: * posi l ion al ignmcnl: (riven the model parame- ters, deLerlniim the mosL likely position align- \]lient.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="24">paramc, lcr cst imal ion: Given the position alignment, i.e. goiug along the alignment paths for all sentence pairs, perform maxi- tnulu likelihood estimation of the model pa- rameters; for model-De(' distributions, these estimates result in relative frequencies.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="25">l)ue to the natnre of tile nfixture tnod(:l, there is no interaction between d jacent word positions.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="26">Theretbre, the optimal position i for each posi- tion j can be determined in(lependently of the neighbouring positions.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="27">Thus l.he resulting train- ing procedure is straightforward.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="28">a.2 Al ignment w i th HMM We now propose all HMM-based alignment model.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="29">'\['he motivation is that typicMly we have a strong localization effect in aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs fi:om \]ndoeuropean lan- guages): the words are not distrilmted arbitrarily over the senteuce \])ositions, but tend to form clus- ters.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="30">Fig.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="31">1 illustrates this effect for the language pair German- 15'nglish.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="32">Each word of the German sentence is assigned to a word of the English sentence.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="33">The alignments have a strong tendency to preserve the local neigh- borhood when going from the one langnage to the other language.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="34">In mm,y cases, although not al~ ways, there is an even stronger restriction: the differeuce in the position index is smMler than 3.</S>

			<S sid="53" ssid="37">To describe these word-by-word aligmnents, we introduce the mapping j ---+ aj, which assigns a word f j in position j to a word el in position { = aj.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="38">The concept of these alignments i similar to the ones introduced by (Brown et al, 1990), but we wilt use another type of dependence in the probability distributions.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="39">Looking at such align- ments produced by a hmnan expert, it is evident that the mathematical model should try to cap- ture the strong dependence of aj on the previous aligmnent.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="40">Therefore the probability of alignment aj for position j should have a dependence on the previous alignment aj _ 1 : p(a j ia j_ l , i ) , where we have inchided the conditioning on the total length \[ of the English sentence for normal- ization reasons.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="41">A sinfilar approach as been cho- sen by (Da.gan et al, 1993).</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="42">Thus the problem formulation is similar to that of the time align- ment problem in speech recognition, where the so-called IIidden Markov models have been suc- cessfully used for a long time (Jelinek, 1976).</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="43">Us- ing the same basic principles, we can rewrite the probability by introducing the 'hidden' alignments af := al. . .aj . . .aa for a sentence pair If,a; e{\]: Pr(f~al es) = ~_,Vr(fal, aT\[ eI't, a7 ,1 = ~ 1-IP"(k,"stfT-',"{ -*,e/) a I j=l So far there has been no basic restriction of the approach.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="44">We now assume a first-order depen- dence on the alignments aj only: Vr(fj,aslf{ -~, J-* a I , e l ) where, in addition, we have assmned that tile translation probability del)ends only oil aj and not oil aj-:l. Putting everything together, we have the ibllowing llMM-based model: a Pr(f:i'le{) = ~ I-I \[p(ajlaj - ' , l).p(Y)lea,)\] (4) af J=, with the following ingredients: ? IlMM alignment probability: p(i\]i', I) or p(a j la j _ l , I ) ; ? translation probabflity: p(f\]e).</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="45">In addition, we assume that the t{MM align- ment probabilities p(i\[i', \[) depend only on the jump width (i - i').</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="46">Using a set of non-negative parameters {s ( i - i')}, we can write the IIMM alignment probabilities in the form: 4 i - i') (5) p(ili', i ) = E ' s(1 - i') 1=1 This form ensures that for each word position i', i' = 1, ..., I, the ItMM alignment probabilities satisfy the normMization constraint.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="47">Note the similarity between Equations (2) and (5).</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="48">The mixtm;e model can be interpreted as a zeroth-order model in contrast to the first-order tlMM model.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="49">As with the IBM2 model, we use again the max- imum approximation: J Pr(fiSle~) "~ max\]--\[ \[p(asl&lt;*j-1, z)p(fj l&lt;~,)\] (6) a ' / .ll.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="50">j,,, j= l In th is case, the task o f f ind ing the opt ima l alignment is more involved than in the case of the mixture model (lBM2).</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="51">Thereibre, we have to re- sort to dynainic programming for which we have the following typical reeursion formula: Q(i, j ) = p(f j lel) ,nvax \[p(ili', 1) . Q(i', j - 1)\] i =l , . , , I Here, Q(i, j ) is a sort of partial probability as in time alignment for speech recognition (Jelinek, 197@.</S>

			<S sid="129" ssid="113">In this paper, we have presented an itMM-based approach for rnodelling word aligmnents in par- allel texts.</S>
			<S sid="130" ssid="114">The characteristic feature of this ap- proach is to make the alignment probabilities ex- plicitly dependent on the alignment position of the previous word.</S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="115">We have tested the model suc- cessfully on real data.</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="116">The HMM-based approach produces translation probabilities comparable to the mixture alignment model.</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="117">When looking at the position alignments those generated by the ItMM model are in general much smoother.</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="118">This could be especially helpful for languages uch as German, where compound words are matched to several words in the source language.</S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="119">On the oth- er hand, large jumps due to different word order- ings in the two languages are successfully modeled.</S>
			<S sid="136" ssid="120">We are presently studying and testing a nmltilevel HMM model that allows only a small number of large jumps.</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="121">The ultimate test of the different alignment and translation models can only be car- ried out in the framework of a fully operational translation system.</S>
