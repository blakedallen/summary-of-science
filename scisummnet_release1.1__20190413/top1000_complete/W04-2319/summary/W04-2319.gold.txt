The ICSI Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA) Corpus
We describe a new corpus of over 180,000 hand-annotated dialog act tags and accompanying adjacency pair annotations for roughly 72 hours of speech from 75 naturally-occurring meetings.
We provide a brief summary of the annotation system and labeling procedure, inter-annotator reliability statistics, overall distributional statistics, a description of auxiliary files distributed with the corpus, and information on how to obtain the data.
