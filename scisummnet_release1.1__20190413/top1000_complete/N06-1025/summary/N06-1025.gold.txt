Exploiting Semantic Role Labeling WordNet And Wikipedia For Coreference Resolution
In this paper we present an extension of a machine learning based coreference resolution system which uses features induced from different semantic knowledge sources.
These features represent knowledge mined from WordNet and Wikipedia, as well as information about semantic role labels.
We show that semantic features indeed improve the performance on different referring expression types such as pronouns and common nouns.
We show that including predicate argument pairs as features improved the performance of a coreference resolver.
We train a model for classifying whether two mentions are co-referring or not.
We suggest to mine semantic relatedness from Wikipedia, which can deal with the data sparseness problem suffered by using WordNet.
