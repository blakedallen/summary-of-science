The Reliability Of A Dialogue Structure Coding Scheme
This paper describes the reliability of a dialogue structure coding scheme based on utterance function, game structure, and higher-level transaction structure that has been applied to a corpus of spontaneous task-oriented spoken dialogues.
We computed agreement on a coarse segmentation level that was constructed on the top of finer segments, by determining how well coders agreed on where the coarse segments started, and, for agreed starts, by computing how coders agreed on where coarse segments ended.
