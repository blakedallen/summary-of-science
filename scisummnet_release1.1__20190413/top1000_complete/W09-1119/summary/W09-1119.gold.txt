Design Challenges and Misconceptions in Named Entity Recognition
We analyze some of the fundamental design challenges and misconceptions that underlie the development of an efficient and robust NER system.
In particular, we address issues such as the representation of text chunks, the inference approach needed to combine local NER decisions, the sources of prior knowledge and how to use them within an NER system.
In the process of comparing several solutions to these challenges we reach some surprising conclusions, as well as develop an NER system that achieves 90.8 F1 score on the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task, the best reported result for this dataset.
We use the IOBES notation to represent NE mentions with label sequences, thereby NER is formalized as a multi class classification problem in which a given token is classified into IOBES labels.
We investigate design challenges for named entity recognition, and showed that other design choices, such as the representation of output labels and using features built on external knowledge, are more important than the learning model itself.
We have shown for the CoNLL-2003 shared task that Greedy decoding (i.e., beam search of width 1) is competitive to the widely used Viterbi algorithm while being over 100 times faster at the same time.
