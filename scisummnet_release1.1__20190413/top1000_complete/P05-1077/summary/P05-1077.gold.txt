Randomized Algorithms And NLP: Using Locality Sensitive Hash Functions For High Speed Noun Clustering
In this paper, we explore the power of randomized algorithm to address the challenge of working with very large amounts of data.
We apply these algorithms to generate noun similarity lists from 70 million pages.
We reduce the running time from quadratic to practically linear in the number of elements to be computed.
We show that by using the LSH nearest neighbors calculation can be done in O(nd) time.
Our method can produce over 70% accuracy in extracting synonyms.
