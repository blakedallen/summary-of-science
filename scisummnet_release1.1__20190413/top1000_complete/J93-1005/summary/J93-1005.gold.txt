Structural Ambiguity And Lexical Relations
We propose that many ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with verbal and nominal heads, estimated on the basis of distribution in an automatically parsed corpus.
This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.
We are the first to show that a corpus-based approach to PP attachment ambiguity resolution can lead to good results.
We propose one of the earliest corpus-based approaches to prepositional phrase attachment used lexical preference by computing co-occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns with prepositions.
We used a partial parser to extract (v, n, p) tuples from a corpus, where p is the preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the verb v and the noun n.
