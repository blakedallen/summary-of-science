  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="4" ssid="1">Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 1990), like other &amp;quot;flexible&amp;quot; categorial grammars, suffers from spurious ambiguity (Wittenburg, 1986).</S>
    <S sid="5" ssid="2">The non-standard constituents that are so crucial to CCG's analyses in (1), and in its account of intonational focus (Prevost &amp; Steedman, 1994), remain available even in simpler sentences.</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="3">This renders (2) syntactically ambiguous.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="4">The practical problem of &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; parses in (2) becomes exponentially worse for longer strings, which can have up to a Catalan number of parses.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="5">An exhaustive parser serves up 252 CCG parses of (3), which must be sifted through, at considerable cost, in order to identify the two distinct meanings for further processing.'</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="6">This paper presents a simple and flexible CCG parsing technique that prevents any such explosion of redundant CCG derivations.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="7">In particular, it is proved in &#167;4.2 that the method constructs exactly one syntactic structure per semantic reading&#8212;e.g., just two parses for (3).</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="8">All other parses are suppressed by simple normal-form constraints that are enforced throughout the parsing process.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="9">This approach works because CCG's spurious ambiguities arise (as is shown) in only a small set of circumstances.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="10">Although similar work has been attempted in the past, with varying degrees of success (Karttunen, 1986; Wittenburg, 1986; Pareschi &amp; Steedman, 1987; Bouma, 1989; Hepple &amp; Morrill, 1989; Ki5nig, 1989; Vijay-Shanker &amp; Weir, 1990; Hepple, 1990; Moortgat, 1990; Hendriks, 1993; Niv, 1994), this appears to be the first full normal-form result for a categorial formalism having more than contextfree power.</S>

    <S sid="55" ssid="12">(Additional comparisons are needed to reject parses other than the lucky 48,620.)</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="13">Adding a parse can therefore take exponential time.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="14">Structure sharing does not appear to help: parses that are grouped in a parse forest have only their syntactic category in common, not their meaning.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="15">Karttunen's approach must tease such parses apart and compare their various meanings individually against each new candidate.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="16">By contrast, the method proposed below is purely syntactic&#8212;just like any &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; parser&#8212;so it never needs to unpack a subforest, and can run in polynomial time. standard constituents are allowed when necessary: (8c) is in normal form (cf.</S>

    <S sid="61" ssid="18">It is not hard to see that (7a) eliminates all but right-branching parses of &amp;quot;forward chains&amp;quot; like A/B B/C C or A/B/C C/D D/E/F/G G/H, and that (7b) eliminates all but left-branching parses of &amp;quot;backward chains.&amp;quot; (Thus every functor will get its arguments, if possible, before it becomes an argument itself.)</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="19">But it is hardly obvious that (7) eliminates all of CCG 's spurious ambiguity.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="20">One might worry about unexpected interactions involving crossing composition rules like A/B B \C &#8211;4- A \ C. Significantly, it turns out that (7) really does suffice; the proof is in &#167;4.2.</S>

    <S sid="72" ssid="1">It is interesting to note a rough resemblance between the tagged version of CCG in (10) and the tagged Lambek calculus L*, which (Hendriks, 1993) developed to eliminate spurious ambiguity from the Lambek calculus L. Although differences between CCG and L mean that the details are quite different, each system works by marking the output of certain rules, to prevent such output from serving as input to certain other rules.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="2">We wish to establish that each semantic equivalence class contains exactly one NF parse.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="3">But what does &amp;quot;semantically equivalent&amp;quot; mean?</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="4">Let us adopt a standard model-theoretic view.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="5">For each leaf (i.e., lexeme) of a given syntax tree, the lexicon specifies a lexical interpretation from the model.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="6">CCG then provides a derived interpretation in the model for the complete tree.</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="7">The standard CCG theory builds the semantics compositionally, guided by the syntax, according to (11).</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="8">We may therefore regard a syntax tree as a static &amp;quot;recipe&amp;quot; for combining word meanings into a phrase meaning.</S>
    <S sid="80" ssid="9">One might choose to say that two parses are semantically equivalent if they derive the same phrase meaning.</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="10">However, such a definition would make spurious ambiguity sensitive to the fine-grained semantics of the lexicon.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="11">Are the two analyses of VP/VP VP VP \VP semantically equivalent?</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="12">If the lexemes involved are &amp;quot;softly knock twice,&amp;quot; then yes, as softly(twice(knock)) and twice(softly(knock)) arguably denote a common function in the semantic model.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="13">Yet for &amp;quot;intentionally knock twice&amp;quot; this is not the case: these adverbs do not commute, and the semantics are distinct.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="14">It would be difficult to make such subtle distinctions rapidly.</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="15">Let us instead use a narrower, &amp;quot;intensional&amp;quot; definition of spurious ambiguity.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="16">The trees in (12a&#8212;b) will be considered equivalent because they specify the same &amp;quot;recipe,&amp;quot; shown in (12c).</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="17">No matter what lexical interpretations f,g,h,k are fed into the leaves A/B, B/C/D, D/E, E/F, both the trees end up with the same derived interpretation, namely a model element that can be determined from f,g,h,k by calculating AxAy.f(g(h(k(x)))(y)).</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="18">By contrast, the two readings of &amp;quot;softly knock twice&amp;quot; are considered to be distinct, since the parses -+ specify different recipes.</S>

  <SECTION title="7 Conclusions" number="5">
    <S sid="142" ssid="1">The main contribution of this work has been formal: to establish a normal form for parses of &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; Cornbinatory Categorial Grammar.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="2">Given a sentence, every reading that is available to the grammar has exactly one normal-form parse, no matter how many parses it has in toto.</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="3">A result worth remembering is that, although TAG-equivalent CCG allows free interaction among forward, backward, and crossed composition rules of any degree, two simple constraints serve to eliminate all spurious ambiguity.</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="4">It turns out that all spurious ambiguity arises from associative &amp;quot;chains&amp;quot; such as A/B B/C C or A/B/C C/D D/E\F/G G/H.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="5">(Wit8 5 tenburg, 1987; Hepple &amp; Morrill, 1989) anticipate this result, at least for some fragments of CCG, but leave the proof to future work.</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="6">These normal-form results for pure CCG lead directly to useful parsers for real, restricted CCG grammars.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="7">Two parsing algorithms have been presented for practical use.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="8">One algorithm finds only normal forms; this simply and safely eliminates spurious ambiguity under most real CCG grammars.</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="9">The other, more complex algorithm solves the spurious ambiguity problem for any CCG grammar, by using normal forms as an efficient tool for grouping semantically equivalent parses.</S>
    <S sid="151" ssid="10">Both algorithms are safe, complete, and efficient.</S>
    <S sid="152" ssid="11">In closing, it should be repeated that the results provided are for the TAG-equivalent Bn (generalized composition) formalism of (Joshi et al., 1991), optionally extended with the S (substitution) rules of (Szabolcsi, 1989).</S>
    <S sid="153" ssid="12">The technique eliminates all spurious ambiguities resulting from the interaction of these rules.</S>
    <S sid="154" ssid="13">Future work should continue by eliminating the spurious ambiguities that arise from grammatical or lexical type-raising.</S>
