Overview of BioNLP&rsquo;09 Shared Task on Event Extraction
Even though considerable attention has been given to semantic orientation of words and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons.
In this paper, we show how we create a high-quality, moderate-sized emotion lexicon using Mechanical Turk.
In addition to questions about emotions evoked by terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level).
We perform an extensive analysis of the annotations to better understand the distribution of emotions evoked by terms of different parts of speech.
We identify which emotions tend to be evoked simultaneously by the same term and show that certain emotions indeed go hand in hand.
The BioNLP 09 Shared Task on Event Extraction, the first large scale evaluation of biomedical event extraction systems, drew the participation of 24 groups and established a standard event representation scheme and datasets.
The BioNLP 09 Shared Task is the first shared task that provided a consistent data set and evaluation tools for extraction of such biological relations.
