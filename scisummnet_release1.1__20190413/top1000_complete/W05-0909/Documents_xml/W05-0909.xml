    <S sid="1" ssid="1">evaluation, such metrics are still of great value and utility* In order to be both effective and useful, an automatic metric for MT evaluation has to satisfy several basic criteria* The primary and most intuitive requirement is that the metric have very high correlation with quantified human notions of MT quality* Furthermore, a good metric should be as sensitive as possible to differences in MT quality between different systems, and between different versions of the same system* The metric should be consistent (same MT system on similar texts should produce similar scores), reliable (MT systems that score similarly can be trusted to perform similarly) and general (applicable to different MT tasks in a wide range of domains and scenarios)* Needless to say, satisfying all of the above criteria is extremely difficult, and all of the metrics that have been proposed so far fall short of adequately addressing most if not all of these requirements* Nevertheless, when appropriately quantified and converted into concrete test measures, such requirements can set an overall standard by which different MT evaluation metrics can be compared and evaluated* In this paper, we describe METEOR', an automatic metric for MT evaluation which we have been developing* METEOR was designed to explicitly address several observed weaknesses in IBM's BLEU metric* It is based on an explicit word-to-word matching between the MT output being evaluated and one or more reference translations* Our current matching supports not only matching between words that are identical in the two strings being compared, but can also match words that are simple morphological variants of each other (i*e* they have an identical stem), and words that are synonyms of each other* We envision ways in which this strict matching can be further expanded in the future, and describe these at the end of the paper* Each possible matching is scored based on a combination of several features* These currently include unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a direct measure of how out-oforder the words of the MT output are with respect to the reference* The score assigned to each individual sentence of MT output is derived from the best scoring match among all matches over all reference translations* The maximal-scoring match</S>

    <S sid="2" ssid="1">ing is then also used in order to calculate an aggregate score for the MT system over the entire test set* Section 2 describes the metric in detail, and provides a full example of the matching and scoring* In previous work (Lavie et al*, 2004), we compared METEOR with IBM's BLEU metric and it's derived NIST metric, using several empirical evaluation methods that have been proposed in the recent literature as concrete means to assess the level of correlation of automatic metrics and human judgments* We demonstrated that METEOR has significantly improved correlation with human judgments* Furthermore, our results demonstrated that recall plays a more important role than precision in obtaining high-levels of correlation with human judgments* The previous analysis focused on correlation with human judgments at the system level* In this paper, we focus our attention on improving correlation between METEOR score and human judgments at the segment level.</S>
    <S sid="3" ssid="2">High-levels of correlation at the segment level are important because they are likely to yield a metric that is sensitive to minor differences between systems and to minor differences between different versions of the same system* Furthermore, current levels of correlation at the sentence level are still rather low, offering a very significant space for improvement* The results reported in this paper demonstrate that all of the individual components included within METEOR contribute to improved correlation with human judgments* In particular, METEOR is shown to have statistically significant better correlation compared to unigram-precision, unigramrecall and the harmonic FI combination of the two* We are currently in the process of exploring several further enhancements to the current METEOR metric, which we believe have the potential to significantly further improve the sensitivity of the metric and its level of correlation with human judgments* Our work on these directions is described in further detail in Section 4*</S>

  <SECTION title="2 The METEOR Metric 2.1 Weaknesses in BLEU Addressed in METEOR" number="3">
    <S sid="4" ssid="1">The main principle behind IBM's BLEU metric (Papineni et al, 2002) is the measurement of the overlap in unigrams (single words) and higher order n-grams of words, between a translation being evaluated and a set of one or more reference translations* The main component of BLEU is n-gram precision: the proportion of the matched n-grams out of the total number of n-grams in the evaluated translation.</S>
    <S sid="5" ssid="2">Precision is calculated separately for each n-gram order, and the precisions are combined via a geometric averaging* BLEU does not take recall into account directly* Recall &#8212; the proportion of the matched n-grams out of the total number of n-grams in the reference translation, is extremely important for assessing the quality of MT output, as it reflects to what degree the translation covers the entire content of the translated sentence* BLEU does not use recall because the notion of recall is unclear when matching simultaneously against a set of reference translations (rather than a single reference)* To compensate for recall, BLEU uses a Brevity Penalty, which penalizes translations for being &amp;quot;too short&amp;quot;* The NIST metric is conceptually similar to BLEU in most aspects, including the weaknesses discussed below* BLEU and NIST suffer from several weaknesses, which we attempt to address explicitly in our proposed METEOR metric: The Lack of Recall: We believe that the fixed brevity penalty in BLEU does not adequately compensate for the lack of recall* Our experimental results strongly support this claim* Use of Higher Order N-grams: Higher order N-grams are used in BLEU as an indirect measure of a translation's level of grammatical wellformedness* We believe an explicit measure for the level of grammaticality (or word order) can better account for the importance of grammaticality as a factor in the MT metric, and result in better correlation with human judgments of translation quality* Lack of Explicit Word-matching Between Translation and Reference: N-gram counts don't require an explicit word-to-word matching, but this can result in counting incorrect &amp;quot;matches&amp;quot;, particularly for common function words* Use of Geometric Averaging of N-grams: Geometric averaging results in a score of &amp;quot;zero&amp;quot; whenever one of the component n-gram scores is zero* Consequently, BLEU scores at the sentence (or segment) level can be meaningless* Although BLEU was intended to be used only for aggregate counts over an entire test-set (and not at the sentence level), scores at the sentence level can be useful indicators of the quality of the metric* In experiments we conducted, a modified version of BLEU that uses equal-weight arithmetic averaging of n-gram scores was found to have better correlation with human judgments* METEOR was designed to explicitly address the weaknesses in BLEU identified above* It evaluates a translation by computing a score based on explicit word-to-word matches between the translation and a reference translation* If more than one reference translation is available, the given translation is scored against each reference independently, and the best score is reported* This is discussed in more detail later in this section* Given a pair of translations to be compared (a system translation and a reference translation), METEOR creates an alignment between the two strings* We define an alignment as a mapping between unigrams, such that every unigram in each string maps to zero or one unigram in the other string, and to no unigrams in the same string* Thus in a given alignment, a single unigram in one string cannot map to more than one unigram in the other string* This alignment is incrementally produced through a series of stages, each stage consisting of two distinct phases* In the first phase an external module lists all the possible unigram mappings between the two strings* Thus, for example, if the word &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; occurs once in the system translation and twice in the reference translation, the external module lists two possible unigram mappings, one mapping the occurrence of &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; in the system translation to the first occurrence of &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; in the reference translation, and another mapping it to the second occurrence* Different modules map unigrams based on different criteria* The &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; module maps two unigrams if they are exactly the same (e*g* &amp;quot;computers&amp;quot; maps to &amp;quot;computers&amp;quot; but not &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot;)* The &amp;quot;porter stem&amp;quot; module maps two unigrams if they are the same after they are stemmed using the Porter stemmer (e*g*: &amp;quot;computers&amp;quot; maps to both &amp;quot;computers&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot;)* The &amp;quot;WN synonymy&amp;quot; module maps two unigrams if they are synonyms of each other* In the second phase of each stage, the largest subset of these unigram mappings is selected such that the resulting set constitutes an alignment as defined above (that is, each unigram must map to at most one unigram in the other string)* If more than one subset constitutes an alignment, and also has the same cardinality as the largest set, METEOR selects that set that has the least number of unigram mapping crosses* Intuitively, if the two strings are typed out on two rows one above the other, and lines are drawn connecting unigrams that are mapped to each other, each line crossing is counted as a &amp;quot;unigram mapping cross&amp;quot;* Formally, two unigram mappings (ti, rj) and (tk, rl) (where ti and tk are unigrams in the system translation mapped to unigrams rj and rl in the reference translation respectively) are said to cross if and only if the following formula evaluates to a negative number: where pos(tx) is the numeric position of the unigram tx in the system translation string, and pos(ry) is the numeric position of the unigram ry in the reference string* For a given alignment, every pair of unigram mappings is evaluated as a cross or not, and the alignment with the least total crosses is selected in this second phase* Note that these two phases together constitute a variation of the algorithm presented in (Turian et al, 2003)* Each stage only maps unigrams that have not been mapped to any unigram in any of the preceding stages* Thus the order in which the stages are run imposes different priorities on the mapping modules employed by the different stages* That is, if the first stage employs the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping module and the second stage employs the &amp;quot;porter stem&amp;quot; module, METEOR is effectively preferring to first map two unigrams based on their surface forms, and performing the stemming only if the surface forms do not match (or if the mapping based on surface forms was too &amp;quot;costly&amp;quot; in terms of the total number of crosses)* Note that METEOR is flexible in terms of the number of stages, the actual external mapping module used for each stage, and the order in which the stages are run* By default the first stage uses the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping module, the second the &amp;quot;porter stem&amp;quot; module and the third the &amp;quot;WN synonymy&amp;quot; mo dule* In section 4 we evaluate each of these configurations of METEOR* Once all the stages have been run and a final alignment has been produced between the system translation and the reference translation, the METEOR score for this pair of translations is computed as follows* First unigram precision (P) is computed as the ratio of the number of unigrams in the system translation that are mapped (to unigrams in the reference translation) to the total number of unigrams in the system translation* Similarly, unigram recall (R) is computed as the ratio of the number of unigrams in the system translation that are mapped (to unigrams in the reference translation) to the total number of unigrams in the reference translation* Next we compute Fmean by combining the precision and recall via a harmonic-mean (van Rijsbergen, 1979) that places most of the weight on recall* We use a harmonic mean of P and 9R* The resulting formula used is: Precision, recall and Fmean are based on unigram matches* To take into account longer matches, METEOR computes a penalty for a given alignment as follows* First, all the unigrams in the system translation that are mapped to unigrams in the reference translation are grouped into the fewest possible number of chunks such that the unigrams in each chunk are in adjacent positions in the system translation, and are also mapped to unigrams that are in adjacent positions in the reference translation* Thus, the longer the n-grams, the fewer the chunks, and in the extreme case where the entire system translation string matches the reference translation there is only one chunk* In the other extreme, if there are no bigram or longer matches, there are as many chunks as there are unigram matches* The penalty is then computed through the following formula: &#65533; #unigrams matched _ For example, if the system translation was &amp;quot;the president spoke to the audience&amp;quot; and the reference translation was &amp;quot;the president then spoke to the audience&amp;quot;, there are two chunks: &amp;quot;the president&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;spoke to the audience&amp;quot;* Observe that the penalty increases as the number of chunks increases to a maximum of 0.5.</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="3">As the number of chunks goes to 1, penalty decreases, and its lower bound is decided by the number of unigrams matched* The parameters if this penalty function were determined based on some experimentation with deveopment data, but have not yet been trained to be optimal* Finally, the METEOR Score for the given alignment is computed as follows: data sets, the MT evaluation systems analyzed in this paper only evaluate English sentences produced by translation systems by comparing them to English reference sentences)* This has the effect of reducing the Fmean by the maximum of 50% if there are no bigram or longer matches* For a single system translation, METEOR computes the above score for each reference translation, and then reports the best score as the score for the translation* The overall METEOR score for a system is calculated based on aggregate statistics accumulated over the entire test set, similarly to the way this is done in BLEU* We calculate aggregate precision, aggregate recall, an aggregate penalty, and then combine them using the same formula used for scoring individual segments*</S>

  <SECTION title="3 Evaluation of the METEOR Metric" number="4">
    <S sid="7" ssid="1">We evaluated the METEOR metric and compared its performance with BLEU and NIST on the DARPA/TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English MT evaluation data released through the LDC as a part of the workshop on Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluation Measures for MT and/or Summarization, at the Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics (2005)* The Chinese data set consists of 920 sentences, while the Arabic data set consists of 664 sentences* Each sentence has four reference translations* Furthermore, for 7 systems on the Chinese data and 6 on the Arabic data, every sentence translation has been assessed by two separate human judges and assigned an Adequacy and a Fluency Score* Each such score ranges from one to five (with one being the poorest grade and five the highest)* For this paper, we computed a Combined Score for each translation by averaging the adequacy and fluency scores of the two judges for that translation* We also computed an average System Score for each translation system by averaging the Combined Score for all the translations produced by that system* (Note that although we refer to these data sets as the &amp;quot;Chinese&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Arabic&amp;quot; In this paper, we are interested in evaluating METEOR as a metric that can evaluate translations on a sentence-by-sentence basis, rather than on a coarse grained system-by-system basis* The standard metrics &#8212; BLEU and NIST &#8212; were however designed for system level scoring, hence computing sentence level scores using BLEU or the NIST evaluation mechanism is unfair to those algorithms* To provide a point of comparison however, table 1 shows the system level correlation between human judgments and various MT evaluation algorithms and sub components of METEOR over the Chinese portion of the Tides 2003 dataset* Specifically, these correlation figures were obtained as follows: Using each algorithm we computed one score per Chinese system by calculating the aggregate scores produced by that algorithm for that system* We also obtained the overall human judgment for each system by averaging all the human scores for that system's translations* We then computed the Pearson correlation between these system level human judgments and the system level scores for each algorithm; these numbers are presented in table 1* Observe that simply using Recall as the MT evaluation metric results in a significant improvement in correlation with human judgment over both the BLEU and the NIST algorithms* These correlations further improve slightly when precision is taken into account (in the F1 measure), when the recall is weighed more heavily than precision (in the Fmean measure) and when a penalty is levied for fragmented matches (in the main METEOR measure)* As mentioned in the previous section, our main goal in this paper is to evaluate METEOR and its components on their translation-by-translation level correlation with human judgment* Towards this end, in the rest of this paper, our evaluation methodology is as follows: For each system, we compute the METEOR Score for every translation produced by the system, and then compute the correlation between these individual scores and the human assessments (average of the adequacy and fluency scores) for the same translations* Thus we get a single Pearson R value for each system for which we have human assessments* Finally we average the R values of all the systems for each of the two language data sets to arrive at the overall average correlation for the Chinese dataset and the Arabic dataset* This number ranges between -1*0 (completely negatively correlated) to +1*0 (completely positively correlated)* We compare the correlation between human assessments and METEOR Scores produced above with that between human assessments and precision, recall and Fmean scores to show the advantage of the various components in the METEOR scoring function* Finally we run METEOR using different mapping modules, and compute the correlation as described above for each configuration to show the effect of each unigram mapping mechanism* We computed sentence by sentence correlation between METEOR Scores and human assessments (average of adequacy and fluency scores) for each translation for every system* Tables 2 and 3 show the Pearson R correlation values for each system, as well as the average correlation value per language dataset* We computed translation by translation correlations between human assessments and other metrics besides the METEOR score, namely precision, recall and Fmean* Tables 4 and 5 show the correlations for the various scores* We observe that recall by itself correlates with human assessment much better than precision, and that combining the two using the Fmean formula the exact matching improves correlations* Some further improvement in correlation is produced by adding the synonymy mo dule* described above results in further improvement* By penalizing the Fmean score using the chunk count we get some further marginal improvement in correlation* To observe the effect of various unigram mapping modules on the correlation between the METEOR score and human assessments, we ran METEOR with different sequences of stages with different mapping modules in them* In the first experiment we ran METEOR with only one stage that used the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping mo dule* This module matches unigrams only if their surface forms match* (This module does not match unigrams that belong to a list of &amp;quot;stop words&amp;quot; that consist mainly of function words)* In the second experiment we ran METEOR with two stages, the first using the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping module, and the second the &amp;quot;Porter&amp;quot; mapping mo dule* The Porter mapping module matches two unigrams to each other if they are identical after being passed through the Porter stemmer* In the third experiment we replaced the Porter mapping module with the WN-Stem mapping mo dule* This module maps two unigrams to each other if they share the same base form in WordNet* This can be thought of as a different kind of stemmer &#8212; the difference from the Porter stemmer is that the word stems are actual words when stemmed through WordNet in this manner* In the last experiment we ran METEOR with three stages, the first two using the exact and the Porter modules, and the third the WN-Synonymy mapping mo dule* This module maps two unigrams together if at least one sense of each word belongs to the same synset in WordNet* Intuitively, this implies that at least one sense of each of the two words represent the same concept* This can be thought of as a poor-man's synonymy detection algorithm that does not disambiguate the words being tested for synonymy* Note that the METEOR scores used to compute correlations in the other tables (1 through 4) used exactly this sequence of stages* Tables 6 and 7 show the correlations between METEOR scores produced in each of these experiments and human assessments for both the Arabic and the Chinese datasets* On both data sets, adding either stemming modules to simply using One problem with conducting correlation experiments with human assessment scores at the sentence level is that the human scores are noisy &#8212; that is, the levels of agreement between human judges on the actual sentence level assessment scores is not extremely high* To partially address this issue, the human assessment scores were normalized by a group at the MITRE Corporation* To see the effect of this noise on the correlation, we computed the correlation between the METEOR Score (computed using the stages used in the 4th experiment in section 7 above) and both the raw human assessments as well as the normalized human assessments* Table 8 shows that indeed METEOR Scores correlate better with normalized human assessments* In other words, the noise in the human assessments hurts the correlations between automatic scores and human assessments*</S>

    <S sid="8" ssid="1">The METEOR metric we described and evaluated in this paper, while already demonstrating great promise, is still relatively simple and naive* We are in the process of enhancing the metric and our experimentation in several directions: Train the Penalty and Score Formulas on Data: The formulas for Penalty and METEOR score were manually crafted based on empirical tests on a separate set of development data* However, we plan to optimize the formulas by training them on a separate data set, and choosing that formula that best correlates with human assessments on the training data* Use Semantic Relatedness to Map Unigrams: So far we have experimented with exact mapping, stemmed mapping and synonymy mapping between unigrams* Our next step is to experiment with different measures of semantic relatedness to match unigrams that have a related meaning, but are not quite synonyms of each other* More Effective Use of Multiple Reference Translations: Our current metric uses multiple reference translations in a weak way: we compare the translation with each reference separately and select the reference with the best match* This was necessary in order to incorporate recall in our metric, which we have shown to be highly advantageous* As our matching approach improves, the need for multiple references for the metric may in fact diminish* Nevertheless, we are exploring ways in which to improve our matching against multiple references* Recent work by (Pang et al, 2003) provides the mechanism for producing semantically meaningful additional &amp;quot;synthetic&amp;quot; references from a small set of real references* We plan to explore whether using such synthetic references can improve the performance of our metric* Weigh Matches Produced by Different Modules Differently: Our current multi-stage approach prefers metric imposes a priority on the different matching mo dules* However, once all the stages have been run, unigrams mapped through different mapping modules are treated the same* Another approach to treating different mappings differently is to apply different weights to the mappings produced by different mapping mo dules* Thus &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; may match &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; with a score of 1, &amp;quot;computers&amp;quot; with a score of 0*8 and &amp;quot;workstation&amp;quot; with a score of 0*3* As future work we plan to develop a version of METEOR that uses such weighting schemes*</S>
