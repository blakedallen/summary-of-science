Evaluation Metrics For Generation
Certain generation applications may profit from the use of stochastic methods.
In developing stochastic methods, it is crucial to be able to quickly assess the relative merits of different approaches or models.
In this paper, we present several types of intrinsic (system internal) metrics which we have used for baseline quantitative assessment.
This quantitative assessment should then be augmented to a fuller evaluation that examines qualitative aspects.
To this end, we describe an experiment that tests correlation between the quantitative metrics and human qualitative judgment.
The experiment confirms that intrinsic metrics cannot replace human evaluation, but some correlate significantly with human judgments of quality and understandability and can be used for evaluation during development.
We propose Simple String Accuracy as a baseline evaluation metric for natural language generation.
