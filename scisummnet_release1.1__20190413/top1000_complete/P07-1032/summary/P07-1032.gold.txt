Formalism-Independent Parser Evaluation with CCG and DepBank
A key question facing the parsing community is how to compare parsers which use different grammar formalisms and produce different output.
Evaluating a parser on the same resource used to create it can lead to non-comparable accuracy scores and an over-optimistic view of parser performance.
In this paper we evaluate a CCG parser on DepBank, and demonstrate the difficulties in converting the parser output into DepBank grammatical relations.
In addition we present a method for measuring the effectiveness of the conversion, which provides an upper bound on parsing accuracy.
The CCG parser obtains an F-score of 81.9% on labelled dependencies, against an upper bound of 84.8%.
We compare the CCG parser against the RASP parser, outperforming RASP by over 5% overall and on the majority of dependency types.
We develop a set of mapping rules from the output of a Combinatorial Categorial grammar parser to the Grammatical Relations (GR) (Carroll et al, 1998).
We demonstrate the use of techniques like adaptive super tagging, parallelisation and a dynamic-programming chart parsing algorithm to implement the C & C parser, a highly efficient CCG parser that performs well against parsers built on different formalisms (Rimell et al, 2009).
