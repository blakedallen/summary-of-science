    "raw_text": "A crucial part of training these systems lies in extracting from the data high-quality contextual information, in the sense of defining contexts that are both accurate and correlated with the information (the POS tags, the word senses, the chunks) the system is trying to extract. The quality of contextual information is often determined by the size of the training corpus: with less data available, extracting context information for any given phenomenon becomes less reliable. However, corpus size is no longer a limiting factor: whereas up to now people have typically worked with corpora of around one million words, it has become feasible to build much larger document collections; for example, Banko and Brill (2001) report on experiments with a one billion word corpus",
