CDER: Efficient MT Evaluation Using Block Movements
Most state-of-the-art evaluation measures for machine translation assign high costs to movements of word blocks.
In many cases though such movements still result in correct or almost correct sentences.
In this paper, we will present a new evaluation measure which explicitly models block reordering as an edit operation.
Our measure can be exactly calculated in quadratic time.
We consider edit distance for word substitution and reordering.
Our CDER measure is based on edit distance, such as the well-known WER, but allows reordering of blocks.
