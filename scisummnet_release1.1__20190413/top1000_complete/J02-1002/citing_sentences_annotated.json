Segmentation We assessed segmentation performance using the Pk and WindowDiff (WD )error measures proposed by (Beeferman et al, 1999) and (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) respectively; both intuitively provide a measure of the probability that two points drawn from the meeting will be incorrectly separated by a hypothesized segment boundary? thus, lower Pk and WD figures indicate better agreement with the human-annotatedresults.3 For the numbers of segments we are dealing with, a baseline of segmenting the discourse into equal-length segments gives both Pk and WD about 50%",
