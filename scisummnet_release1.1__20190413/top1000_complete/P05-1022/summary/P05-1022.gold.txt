Coarse-To-Fine N-Best Parsing And MaxEnt Discriminative Reranking
Discriminative reranking is one method for constructing high-performance statistical parsers (Collins, 2000).
A discriminative reranker requires a source of candidate parses for each sentence.
This paper describes a simple yet novel method for constructing sets of 50-best parses based on a coarse-to-fine generative parser (Charniak, 2000).
This method generates 50-best lists that are of substantially higher quality than previously obtainable.
We used these parses as the input to a MaxEnt reranker (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002) that selects the best parse from the set of parses for each sentence, obtaining an f-score of 91.0% on sentences of length 100 or less.
We use pruning, where edges in a coarse-grained parse forest are pruned to allow full evaluation with fine grained categories.
We show accuracy improvements from composed local tree features on top of a lexicalized base parser.
To improve performance and robustness, features are pruned so that selected features must distinguish a parse with the highest F1 score in a n-best list, from a parse with a suboptimal F1 score at least five times.
