WordNet::Similarity - Measuring The Relatedness Of Concepts
WordNet::Similarity is a freely available software package that makes it possible to measure the semantic similarity and relatedness between a pair of concepts (or synsets).
It provides six measures of similarity, and three measures of relatedness, all of which are based on the lexical database WordNet.
These measures are implemented as Perl modules which take as input two concepts, and return a numeric value that represents the degree to which they are similar or related.
Extensive research concerning the integration of semantic knowledge into NLP for the English language has been arguably fostered by the emergence of WordNet::Similarity package.
The measures vary from simple edge-counting to attempt to factor in peculiarities of the network structure by considering link direction, relative path, and density, such as vector, lesk, hso, lch, wup, path, res, lin and jcn.
