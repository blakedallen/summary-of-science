Inversion Transduction Grammar for Joint Phrasal Translation Modeling
We present a phrasal inversion transduction grammar as an alternative to joint phrasal translation models.
This syntactic model is similar to its flat-string phrasal predecessors, but admits polynomial-time algorithms for Viterbi alignment and EM training.
We demonstrate that the consistency constraints that allow flat phrasal models to scale also help ITG algorithms, producing an 80-times faster inside-outside algorithm.
We also show that the phrasal translation tables produced by the ITG are superior to those of the flat joint phrasal model, producing up to a 2.5 point improvement in BLEU score.
Finally, we explore, for the first time, the utility of a joint phrasal translation model as a word alignment method.
We use synchronous ITG (Wu, 1997) and constraints to find non-compositional phrasal equivalences.
