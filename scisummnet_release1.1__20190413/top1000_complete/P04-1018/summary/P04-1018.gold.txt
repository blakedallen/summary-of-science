A Mention-Synchronous Coreference Resolution Algorithm Based On The Bell Tree
This paper proposes a new approach for coreference resolution which uses the Bell tree to represent the search space and casts the coreference resolution problem as finding the best path from the root of the Bell tree to the leaf nodes.
A Maximum Entropy model is used to rank these paths.
The coreference performance on the 2002 and 2003 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data will be reported.
We also train a coreference system using the MUC6 data and competitive results are obtained.
We apply beam search at test time, but use a static assignment of antecedents and learns log-linear model using batch learning.
We use a Bell tree whose leaves represent possible partitionings of the mentions into entities and then trained a model for searching the tree.
To cope with computational complexity, we heuristically search for the most probable partition by performing a beam search through a Bell tree.
We show that one can obtain a very high MUC score simply by lumping all mentions together.
We applied the ANY predicate to generate cluster-level features for their entity-mention model, which did not perform as well as the mention-pair model.
