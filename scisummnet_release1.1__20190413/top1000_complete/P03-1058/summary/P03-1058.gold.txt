Exploiting Parallel Texts For Word Sense Disambiguation: An Empirical Study
A central problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the lack of manually sense-tagged data required for supervised learning.
In this paper, we evaluate an approach to automatically acquire sense-tagged training data from English-Chinese parallel corpora, which are then used for disambiguating the nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task.
Our investigation reveals that this method of acquiring sense-tagged data is promising.
On a subset of the most difficult SENSEVAL-2 nouns, the accuracy difference between the two approaches is only 14.0%, and the difference could narrow further to 6.5% if we disregard the advantage that manually sense-tagged data have in their sense coverage.
Our analysis also highlights the importance of the issue of domain dependence in evaluating WSD programs.
We address word sense disambiguation by manually annotating WordNet senses with their translation in the target language (Chinese), and then automatically extracting labeled examples for word sense disambiguation by applying the IBM Models to a bilingual corpus.
When several senses of an English word are translated by the same Chinese word, we can collapse these senses to obtain a coarser-grained, lumped sense inventory.
