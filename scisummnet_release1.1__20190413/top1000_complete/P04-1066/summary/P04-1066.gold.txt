Improving IBM Word Alignment Model 1
We investigate a number of simple methods for improving the word-alignment accuracy of IBM Model 1.
We demonstrate reduction in alignment error rate of approximately 30% resulting from (1) giving extra weight to the probability of alignment to the null word, (2) smoothing probability estimates for rare words, and (3) using a simple heuristic estimation method to initialize, or replace, EM training of model parameters.
A limitation of IBM Model 1 is that each word in the target sentence can be generated by at most one word in the source sentence.
We also suggested adding multiple empty words to the target sentence for IBM Model 1.
Our method also alleviates another related limitation by enabling translation between contiguous words across the query and documents.
