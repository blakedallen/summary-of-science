PRINCIPAR - An Efficient Broad-Coverage Principle-Based Parser
We present an efficient, broad-coverage, principle-based parser for English.
The parser has been implemented in C++ and runs on SUN Sparcstations with X-windows.
It contains a lexicon with over 90,000 entries, constructed automatically by applying a set of extraction and conversion rules to entries from machine readable dictionaries.
We release MiniPar, a fast and robust parser for grammatical dependency relations.
