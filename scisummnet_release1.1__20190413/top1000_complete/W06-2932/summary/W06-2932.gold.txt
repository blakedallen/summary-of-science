Multilingual Dependency Analysis With A Two-Stage Discriminative Parser
We present a two-stage multilingual dependency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages.
The first stage is based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.
The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph.
We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.
We use post-processing for non-projective dependencies and for labeling.
We treat the labeling of dependencies as a sequence labeling problem.
The specific graph-based model studied in this work factors scores over pairs of arcs (instead of just single arcs) and uses near exhaustive search for unlabeled parsing coupled with a separate classifier to label each arc.
