Experiments in Domain Adaptation for Statistical Machine Translation
The special challenge of the WMT 2007 shared task was domain adaptation.
We took this opportunity to experiment with various ways of adapting a statistical machine translation systems to a special domain (here: news commentary), when most of the training data is from a different domain (here: European Parliament speeches).
This paper also gives a description of the submission of the University of Edinburgh to the shared task.
Factored translation models is used for the integration of domain adaptation.
We use two language models and two translation models: one in-domain and other out-of-domain to adapt the system.
We learn mixture weights for language models trained with in-domain and out of-domain data respectively by minimizing the perplexity of a tuning (development) set and interpolating the models.
