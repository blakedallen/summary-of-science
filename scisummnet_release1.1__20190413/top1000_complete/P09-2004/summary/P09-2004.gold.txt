Using Syntax to Disambiguate Explicit Discourse Connectives in Text
Discourse connectives are words or phrases such as once, since, and on the contrary that explicitly signal the presence of a discourse relation.
There are two types of ambiguity that need to be resolved during discourse processing.
First, a word can be ambiguous between discourse or non-discourse usage.
For example, once can be either a temporal discourse connective or a simply a word meaning “formerly”.
Secondly, some connectives are ambiguous in terms of the relation they mark.
For example since can serve as either a temporal or causal connective.
We demonstrate that syntactic features improve performance in both disambiguation tasks.
We report state-ofthe-art results for identifying discourse vs. non-discourse usage and human-level performance on sense disambiguation.
We show that where explicit markers exist, the class of the relation can be disambiguated with f-scores higher than 90%. Predicting the class of implicit discourse relations, however, is much more difficult.
