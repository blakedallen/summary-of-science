  </ABSTRACT>
  <SECTION title="1 Introduction" number="1">
    <S sid="5" ssid="1">The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is perhaps the most influential resource in Natural Language Processing (NLP).</S>
    <S sid="6" ssid="2">It is used as a standard training and evaluation corpus in many syntactic analysis tasks, ranging from part of speech (POS) tagging and chunking, to full parsing.</S>
    <S sid="7" ssid="3">Unfortunately, the Penn Treebank does not annotate the internal structure of base noun phrases, instead leaving them flat.</S>
    <S sid="8" ssid="4">This significantly simplified and sped up the manual annotation process.</S>
    <S sid="9" ssid="5">Therefore, any system trained on Penn Treebank data will be unable to model the syntactic and semantic structure inside base-NPs.</S>
    <S sid="10" ssid="6">The following NP is an example of the flat structure of base-NPs within the Penn Treebank:</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="(NP (NNP Air) (NNP Force) (NN contract))" number="2">
    <S sid="11" ssid="1">Air Force is a specific entity and should form a separate constituent underneath the NP, as in our new annotation scheme: We use NML to specify that Air Force together is a nominal modifier of contract.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="2">Adding this annotation better represents the true syntactic and semantic structure, which will improve the performance of downstream NLP systems.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="3">Our main contribution is a gold-standard labelled bracketing for every ambiguous noun phrase in the Penn Treebank.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="4">We describe the annotation guidelines and process, including the use of named entity data to improve annotation quality.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="5">We check the correctness of the corpus by measuring interannotator agreement, by reannotating the first section, and by comparing against the sub-NP structure in DepBank (King et al., 2003).</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="6">We also give an analysis of our extended Treebank, quantifying how much structure we have added, and how it is distributed across NPs.</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="7">Finally, we test the utility of the extended Treebank for training statistical models on two tasks: NP bracketing (Lauer, 1995; Nakov and Hearst, 2005) and full parsing (Collins, 1999).</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="8">This new resource will allow any system or annotated corpus developed from the Penn Treebank, to represent noun phrase structure more accurately.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="2 Motivation" number="3">
    <S sid="19" ssid="1">Many approaches to identifying base noun phrases have been explored as part of chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), but determining sub-NP structure is rarely addressed.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="2">We could use multi-word expressions (MWEs) to identify some structure.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="3">For example, knowing stock market is a MWE may help bracket stock market prices correctly, and Named Entities (NEs) can be used the same way.</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="4">However, this only resolves NPs dominating MWEs or NEs.</S>
    <S sid="23" ssid="5">Understanding base-NP structure is important, since otherwise parsers will propose nonsensical noun phrases like Force contract by default and pass them onto downstream components.</S>
    <S sid="24" ssid="6">For example, Question Answering (QA) systems need to supply an NP as the answer to a factoid question, often using a parser to identify candidate NPs to return to the user.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="7">If the parser never generates the correct sub-NP structure, then the system may return a nonsensical answer even though the correct dominating noun phrase has been found.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="8">Base-NP structure is also important for annotated data derived from the Penn Treebank.</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="9">For instance, CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003) was created by semi-automatically converting the Treebank phrase structure to Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) derivations.</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="10">Since CCG derivations are binary branching, they cannot directly represent the flat structure of the Penn Treebank base-NPs.</S>
    <S sid="29" ssid="11">Without the correct bracketing in the Treebank, strictly right-branching trees were created for all base-NPs.</S>
    <S sid="30" ssid="12">This has an unwelcome effect when conjunctions occur within an NP (Figure 1).</S>
    <S sid="31" ssid="13">An additional grammar rule is needed just to get a parse, but it is still not correct (Hockenmaier, 2003, p. 64).</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="14">The awkward conversion results in bracketing (a) which should be (b): We have previously experimented with using NEs to improve parsing performance on CCGbank.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="15">Due to the mis-alignment of NEs and right-branching NPs, the increase in performance was negligible.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="3 Background" number="4">
    <S sid="34" ssid="1">The NP bracketing task has often been posed in terms of choosing between the left or right branching structure of three word noun compounds: Most approaches to the problem use unsupervised methods, based on competing association strength between two of the words in the compound (Marcus, 1980, p. 253).</S>
    <S sid="35" ssid="2">There are two possible models to choose from: dependency or adjacency.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="3">The dependency model compares the association between words 1-2 to words 1-3, while the adjacency model compares words 1-2 to words 2-3.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="4">Lauer (1995) has demonstrated superior performance of the dependency model using a test set of 244 (216 unique) noun compounds drawn from Grolier&#8217;s encyclopedia.</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="5">This data has been used to evaluate most research since.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="6">He uses Roget&#8217;s thesaurus to smooth words into semantic classes, and then calculates association between classes based on their counts in a &#8220;training set&#8221; also drawn from Grolier&#8217;s.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="7">He achieves 80.7% accuracy using POS tags to indentify bigrams in the training set.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="8">Lapata and Keller (2004) derive estimates from web counts, and only compare at a lexical level, achieving 78.7% accuracy.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="9">Nakov and Hearst (2005) also use web counts, but incorporate additional counts from several variations on simple bigram queries, including queries for the pairs of words concatenated or joined by a hyphen.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="10">This results in an impressive 89.3% accuracy.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="11">There have also been attempts to solve this task using supervised methods, even though the lack of gold-standard data makes this difficult.</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="12">Girju et al. (2005) draw a training set from raw WSJ text and use it to train a decision tree classifier achieving 73.1% accuracy.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="13">When they shuffled their data with Lauer&#8217;s to create a new test and training split, their accuracy increased to 83.1% which may be a result of the 10% duplication in Lauer&#8217;s test set.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="14">We have created a new NP bracketing data set from our extended Treebank by extracting all rightmost three noun sequences from base-NPs.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="15">Our initial experiments are presented in Section 6.1.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="4 Corpus Creation" number="5">
    <S sid="49" ssid="1">According to Marcus et al. (1993), asking annotators to markup base-NP structure significantly reduced annotation speed, and for this reason baseNPs were left flat.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="2">The bracketing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) also mention the considerable difficulty of identifying the correct scope for nominal modifiers.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="3">We found however, that while there are certainly difficult cases, the vast majority are quite simple and can be annotated reliably.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="4">Our annotation philosophy can be summarised as: During this process we identified numerous cases that require a more sophisticated annotation scheme.</S>
    <S sid="53" ssid="5">There are genuine flat cases, primarily names like John A. Smith, that we would like to distinguish from implicitly right-branching NPs in the next version of the corpus.</S>
    <S sid="54" ssid="6">Although our scheme is still developing, we believe that the current annotation is already useful for statistical modelling, and we demonstrate this empirically in Section 6.</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="7">Our annotation guidelines) are based on those developed for annotating full sub-NP structure in the biomedical domain (Kulick et al., 2004).</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="8">The annotation guidelines for this biomedical corpus (an addendum to the Penn Treebank guidelines) introduce the use of NML nodes to mark internal NP structure.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="9">In summary, our guidelines leave right-branching structures untouched, and insert labelled brackets around left-branching structures.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="10">The label of the newly created constituent is NML or JJP, depending on whether its head is a noun or an adjective.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="11">We also chose not to alter the existing Penn Treebank annotation, even though the annotators found many errors during the annotation process.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="12">We wanted to keep our extended Treebank as similar to the original as possible, so that they remain comparable.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="13">We developed a bracketing tool, which identifies ambiguous NPs and presents them to the user for disambiguation.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="14">An ambiguous NP is any (possibly non-base) NP with three or more contiguous children that are either single words or another NP.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="15">Certain common patterns, such as three words beginning with a determiner, are unambiguous, and were filtered out.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="16">The annotator is also shown the entire sentence surrounding the ambiguous NP.</S>
    <S sid="65" ssid="17">The bracketing tool often suggests a bracketing using rules based mostly on named entity tags, which are drawn from the BBN corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="66" ssid="18">For example, since Air Force is given ORG tags, the tool suggests that they be bracketed together first.</S>
    <S sid="67" ssid="19">Other suggestions come from previous bracketings of the same words, which helps to keep the annotator consistent.</S>
    <S sid="68" ssid="20">Two post processes were carried out to increase annotation consistency and correctness.</S>
    <S sid="69" ssid="21">915 difficult NPs were marked by the annotator and were then discussed with two other experts.</S>
    <S sid="70" ssid="22">Secondly, certain phrases that occurred numerous times and were non-trivial to bracket, e.g.</S>
    <S sid="71" ssid="23">London Interbank Offered Rate, were identified.</S>
    <S sid="72" ssid="24">An extra pass was made through the corpus, ensuring that every instance of these phrases was bracketed consistently.</S>
    <S sid="73" ssid="25">Annotation initially took over 9 hours per section of the Treebank.</S>
    <S sid="74" ssid="26">However, with practice this was reduced to about 3 hours per section.</S>
    <S sid="75" ssid="27">Each section contains around 2500 ambiguous NPs, i.e. annotating took approximately 5 seconds per NP.</S>
    <S sid="76" ssid="28">Most NPs require no bracketing, or fit into a standard pattern which the annotator soon becomes accustomed to, hence the task can be performed quite quickly.</S>
    <S sid="77" ssid="29">For the original bracketing of the Treebank, annotators performed at 375&#8211;475 words per hour after a few weeks, and increased to about 1000 words per hour after gaining more experience (Marcus et al., 1993).</S>
    <S sid="78" ssid="30">For our annotation process, counting each word in every NP shown, our speed was around 800 words per hour.</S>
    <S sid="79" ssid="31">This figure is not unexpected, as the task was not large enough to get more than a month&#8217;s experience, and there is less structure to annotate.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="5 Corpus Analysis" number="6">
    <S sid="80" ssid="1">The annotation was performed by the first author.</S>
    <S sid="81" ssid="2">A second Computational Linguistics PhD student also annotated Section 23, allowing inter-annotator agreement, and the reliability of the annotations, to be measured.</S>
    <S sid="82" ssid="3">This also maximised the quality of the section used for parser testing.</S>
    <S sid="83" ssid="4">We measured the proportion of matching brackets and dependencies between annotators, shown in Table 1, both before and after they discussed cases of disagreement and revised their annotations.</S>
    <S sid="84" ssid="5">The number of dependencies is fixed by the length of the NP, so the dependency precision and recall are the same.</S>
    <S sid="85" ssid="6">Counting matched brackets is a harsher evaluation, as there are many NPs that both annotators agree should have no additional bracketing, which are not taken into account by the metric.</S>
    <S sid="86" ssid="7">The disagreements occurred for a small number of repeated instances, such as this case: The first annotator felt that Goldman , Sachs should form their own NML constituent, while the second annotator did not.</S>
    <S sid="87" ssid="8">We can also look at exact matching on NPs, where the annotators originally agreed in 2667 of 2908 cases (91.71%), and after revision, in 2864 of 2907 cases (98.52%).</S>
    <S sid="88" ssid="9">These results demonstrate that high agreement rates are achievable for these annotations.</S>
    <S sid="89" ssid="10">Another approach to measuring annotator reliability is to compare with an independently annotated corpus on the same text.</S>
    <S sid="90" ssid="11">We used the PARC700 Dependency Bank (King et al., 2003) which consists of 700 Section 23 sentences annotated with labelled dependencies.</S>
    <S sid="91" ssid="12">We use the Briscoe and Carroll (2006) version of DepBank, a 560 sentence subset used to evaluate the RASP parser.</S>
    <S sid="92" ssid="13">Some translation is required to compare our brackets to DepBank dependencies.</S>
    <S sid="93" ssid="14">We map the brackets to dependencies by finding the head of the NP, using the Collins (1999) head finding rules, and then creating a dependency between each other child&#8217;s head and this head.</S>
    <S sid="94" ssid="15">This does not work perfectly, and mismatches occur because of which dependencies DepBank marks explicitly, and how it chooses heads.</S>
    <S sid="95" ssid="16">The errors are investigated manually to determine their cause.</S>
    <S sid="96" ssid="17">The results are shown in Table 2, with the number of agreements before manual checking shown in parentheses.</S>
    <S sid="97" ssid="18">Once again the dependency numbers are higher than those at the NP level.</S>
    <S sid="98" ssid="19">Similarly, when we only look at cases where we have inserted some annotations, we are looking at more difficult cases and the score is not as high.</S>
    <S sid="99" ssid="20">The results of this analysis are quite positive.</S>
    <S sid="100" ssid="21">Over half of the disagreements that occur (in either measure) are caused by how company names are bracketed.</S>
    <S sid="101" ssid="22">While we have always separated the company name from post-modifiers such as Corp and Inc, DepBank does not in most cases.</S>
    <S sid="102" ssid="23">These results show that consistently and correctly bracketing noun phrase structure is possible, and that interannotator agreement is at an acceptable level.</S>
    <S sid="103" ssid="24">Looking at the entire Penn Treebank corpus, the annotation tool finds 60959 ambiguous NPs out of the 432639 NPs in the corpus (14.09%).</S>
    <S sid="104" ssid="25">22851 of these (37.49%) had brackets inserted by the annotator.</S>
    <S sid="105" ssid="26">This is as we expect, as the majority of NPs are right-branching.</S>
    <S sid="106" ssid="27">Of the brackets added, 22368 were NML nodes, while 863 were JJP.</S>
    <S sid="107" ssid="28">To compare, we can count the number of existing NP and ADJP nodes found in the NPs that the bracketing tool presents.</S>
    <S sid="108" ssid="29">We find there are 32772 NP children, and 579 ADJP, which are quite similar numbers to the amount of nodes we have added.</S>
    <S sid="109" ssid="30">From this, we can say that our annotation process has introduced almost as much structural information into NPs as there was in the original Penn Treebank.</S>
    <S sid="110" ssid="31">Table 3 shows the most common POS tag sequences for NP, NML and JJP nodes.</S>
    <S sid="111" ssid="32">An example is given showing typical words that match the POS tags.</S>
    <S sid="112" ssid="33">For NML and JJP, we also show the words bracketed, as they would appear under an NP node.</S>
    <S sid="113" ssid="34">We checked the consistency of the annotations by identifying NPs with the same word sequence and checking whether they were always bracketed identically.</S>
    <S sid="114" ssid="35">After the first pass through, there were 360 word sequences with multiple bracketings, which occurred in 1923 NP instances.</S>
    <S sid="115" ssid="36">489 of these instances differed from the majority case for that sequence, and were probably errors.</S>
    <S sid="116" ssid="37">The annotator had marked certain difficult and commonly repeating NPs.</S>
    <S sid="117" ssid="38">From this we generated a list of phrases, and then made another pass through the corpus, synchronising all instances that contained one of these phrases.</S>
    <S sid="118" ssid="39">After this, only 150 instances differed from the majority case.</S>
    <S sid="119" ssid="40">Inspecting these remaining inconsistencies showed cases like: where we were inconsistent in inserting the NML node because the Penn Treebank sometimes already has the structure annotated under an NP node.</S>
    <S sid="120" ssid="41">Since we do not make changes to existing brackets, we cannot fix these cases.</S>
    <S sid="121" ssid="42">Other inconsistencies are rare, but will be examined and corrected in a future release.</S>
    <S sid="122" ssid="43">The annotator made a second pass over Section 00 to correct changes made after the beginning of the annotation process.</S>
    <S sid="123" ssid="44">Comparing the two passes can give us some idea of how the annotator changed as he grew more practiced at the task.</S>
    <S sid="124" ssid="45">We find that the old and new versions are identical in 88.65% of NPs, with labelled precision, recall and F-score being 97.17%, 76.69% and 85.72% respectively.</S>
    <S sid="125" ssid="46">This tells us that there were many brackets originally missed that were added in the second pass.</S>
    <S sid="126" ssid="47">This is not surprising since the main problem with how Section 00 was annotated originally was that company names were not separated from their post-modifier (such as Corp).</S>
    <S sid="127" ssid="48">Besides this, it suggests that there is not a great deal of difference between an annotator just learning the task, and one who has had a great deal of experience with it.</S>
    <S sid="128" ssid="49">We have also evaluated how well the suggestion feature of the annotation tool performs.</S>
    <S sid="129" ssid="50">In particular, we want to determine how useful named entities are in determining the correct bracketing.</S>
    <S sid="130" ssid="51">We ran the tool over the original corpus, following NE-based suggestions where possible.</S>
    <S sid="131" ssid="52">We find that when evaluated against our annotations, the Fscore is 50.71%.</S>
    <S sid="132" ssid="53">We need to look closer at the precision and recall though, as they are quite different.</S>
    <S sid="133" ssid="54">The precision of 93.84% is quite high.</S>
    <S sid="134" ssid="55">However, there are many brackets where the entities do not help at all, and so the recall of this method was only 34.74%.</S>
    <S sid="135" ssid="56">This suggests that a NE feature may help to identify the correct bracketing in one third of cases.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="6 Experiments" number="7">
    <S sid="136" ssid="1">Having bracketed NPs in the Penn Treebank, we now describe our initial experiments on how this additional level of annotation can be exploited.</S>
    <S sid="137" ssid="2">The obvious first task to consider is noun phrase bracketing itself.</S>
    <S sid="138" ssid="3">We implement a similar system to Lauer (1995), described in Section 3, and report on results from our own data and Lauer&#8217;s original set.</S>
    <S sid="139" ssid="4">First, we extracted three word noun sequences from all the ambiguous NPs.</S>
    <S sid="140" ssid="5">If the last three children are nouns, then they became an example in our data set.</S>
    <S sid="141" ssid="6">If there is a NML node containing the first two nouns then it is left-branching, otherwise it is right-branching.</S>
    <S sid="142" ssid="7">Because we are only looking at the right-most part of the NP, we know that we are not extracting any nonsensical items.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="8">We also remove all items where the nouns are all part of a named entity to eliminate flat structure cases.</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="9">Statistics about the new data set and Lauer&#8217;s data set are given in Table 4.</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="10">As can be seen, the Penn Treebank based corpus is significantly larger, and has a more even mix of left and right-branching noun phrases.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="11">We also measured the amount of lexical overlap between the two corpora, shown in Table 5.</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="12">This displays the percentage of n-grams in Lauer&#8217;s corpus that are also in our corpus.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="13">We can clearly see that the two corpora are quite dissimilar, as even on unigrams barely half are shared.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="14">With our new data set, we began running experiments similar to those carried out in the literature (Nakov and Hearst, 2005).</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="15">We implemented both an adjacency and dependency model, and three different association measures: raw counts, bigram probability, and .</S>
    <S sid="151" ssid="16">We draw our counts from a corpus of n-gram counts calculated over 1 trillion words from the web (Brants and Franz, 2006).</S>
    <S sid="152" ssid="17">The results from the experiments, on both our and Lauer&#8217;s data set, are shown in Table 6.</S>
    <S sid="153" ssid="18">Our results on Lauer&#8217;s corpus are similar to those reported previously, with the dependency model outperforming the adjacency model on all measures.</S>
    <S sid="154" ssid="19">The bigram probability scores highest out of all the measures, while the score performed the worst.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="20">The results on the new corpus are even more surprising, with the adjacency model outperforming the dependency model by a wide margin.</S>
    <S sid="156" ssid="21">The measure gives the highest accuracy, but still only just outperforms the raw counts.</S>
    <S sid="157" ssid="22">Our analysis shows that the good performance of the adjacency model comes from the large number of named entities in the corpus.</S>
    <S sid="158" ssid="23">When we remove all items that have any word as an entity, the results change, and the dependency model is superior.</S>
    <S sid="159" ssid="24">We also suspect that another cause of the unusual results is the different proportions of left and right-branching NPs.</S>
    <S sid="160" ssid="25">With a large annotated corpus, we can now run supervised NP bracketing experiments.</S>
    <S sid="161" ssid="26">We present two configurations in Table 7: training on our corpus and testing on Lauer&#8217;s set; and performing 10-fold cross validation using our corpus alone.</S>
    <S sid="162" ssid="27">The feature set we explore encodes the information we used in the unsupervised experiments.</S>
    <S sid="163" ssid="28">Table 7 shows the performance with: all features, followed by the individual features, and finally, after removing individual features.</S>
    <S sid="164" ssid="29">The feature set includes: lexical features for each n-gram in the noun compound; n-gram counts for unigrams, bigrams and trigrams; raw probability and association scores for all three bigrams in the compound; and the adjacency and dependency results for all three association measures.</S>
    <S sid="165" ssid="30">We discretised the non-binary features using an implementation of Fayyad and Irani&#8217;s (1993) algorithm, and classify using MegaM2.</S>
    <S sid="166" ssid="31">The results on Lauer&#8217;s set demonstrate that the dependency model performs well by itself but not with the other features.</S>
    <S sid="167" ssid="32">In fact, a better result comes from using every feature except those from the dependency and adjacency models.</S>
    <S sid="168" ssid="33">It is also impressive how good the performance is, considering the large differences between our data set and Lauer&#8217;s.</S>
    <S sid="169" ssid="34">These differences also account for the disparate cross-validation figures.</S>
    <S sid="170" ssid="35">On this data, the lexical features perform the best, which is to be expected given the nature of the corpus.</S>
    <S sid="171" ssid="36">The best model in this case comes from using all the features.</S>
    <S sid="172" ssid="37">We can also look at the impact of our new annotations upon full statistical parsing.</S>
    <S sid="173" ssid="38">We use Bikel&#8217;s implementation (Bikel, 2004) of Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1999) in order to carry out these experiments, using the non-deficient Collins settings.</S>
    <S sid="174" ssid="39">The numbers we give are labelled bracket precision, recall and F-scores for all sentences.</S>
    <S sid="175" ssid="40">Bikel mentions that base-NPs are treated very differently in Collins&#8217; parser, and so it will be interesting to observe the results using our new annotations.</S>
    <S sid="176" ssid="41">Firstly, we compare the parser&#8217;s performance on the original Penn Treebank and the new NML and JJP bracketed version.</S>
    <S sid="177" ssid="42">Table 8 shows that the new brackets make parsing marginally more difficult overall (by about 0.5% in F-score).</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="43">The performance on only the new NML and JJP brackets is not very high.</S>
    <S sid="179" ssid="44">This shows the difficulty of correctly bracketing NPs.</S>
    <S sid="180" ssid="45">Conversely, the figures for all brackets except NML and JJP are only a tiny amount less in our extended corpus.</S>
    <S sid="181" ssid="46">This means that performance for other phrases is hardly changed by the new NP brackets.</S>
    <S sid="182" ssid="47">We also ran an experiment where the new NML and JJP labels were relabelled as NP and AnJP.</S>
    <S sid="183" ssid="48">These are the labels that would be given if NPs were originally bracketed with the rest of the Penn Treebank.</S>
    <S sid="184" ssid="49">This meant the model would not have to discriminate between two different types of noun and adjective structure.</S>
    <S sid="185" ssid="50">The performance, as shown in Table 8, was even lower with this approach, suggesting that the distinction is larger than we anticipated.</S>
    <S sid="186" ssid="51">On the other hand, the precision on NML and JJP constituents was quite high, so the parser is able to identify at least some of the structure very well.</S>
