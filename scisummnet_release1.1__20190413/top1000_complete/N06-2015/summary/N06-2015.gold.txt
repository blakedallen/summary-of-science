OntoNotes: The 90% Solution
We describe the OntoNotes methodology and its result, a large multilingual richly-annotated corpus constructed at 90% interannotator agreement.
An initial portion (300K words of English newswire and 250K words of Chinese newswire) will be made available to the community during 2007.
Ontonotes includes a wide array of data sources like broadcast news, news wire, magazine, web text, etc.
In the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006), annotators use small-scale corpus analysis to create sense inventories derived by grouping together WordNet senses, with the procedure restricted to maintain 90% inter-annotator agreement.
