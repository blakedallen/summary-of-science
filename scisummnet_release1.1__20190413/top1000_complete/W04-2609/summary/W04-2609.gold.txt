Models For The Semantic Classification Of Noun Phrases
This paper presents an approach for detecting semantic relations in noun phrases.
A learning algorithm, called semantic scattering, is used to automatically label complex nominals, genitives and adjectival noun phrases with the corresponding semantic relation.
We propose a 35 class scheme to classify relations in various phrases.
We propose a method called semantic scattering for interpreting NCs.
