A Fully Statistical Approach To Natural Language Interfaces
We present a natural language interface system which is based entirely on trained statistical models.
The system consists of three stages of processing: parsing, semantic interpretation, and discourse.
Each of these stages is modeled as a statistical process.
The models are fully integrated, resulting in an end-to-end system that maps input utterances into meaning representation frames.
Our approach is fully supervised and produces a final meaning representation in SQL.
We compute the probability that a constituent such as Atlanta filled a semantic slot such as Destination in a semantic frame for air travel.
