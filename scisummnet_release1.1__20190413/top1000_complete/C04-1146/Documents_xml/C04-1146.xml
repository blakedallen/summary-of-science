			<S sid="5" ssid="5">Over recent years, many Natural Language Pro cessing (NLP) techniques have been developedthat might benefit from knowledge of distribu tionally similar words, i.e., words that occur in similar contexts.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">For example, the sparse dataproblem can make it difficult to construct language models which predict combinations of lex ical events.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Similarity-based smoothing (Brown et al, 1992; Dagan et al, 1999) is an intuitivelyappealing approach to this problem where prob abilities of unseen co-occurrences are estimatedfrom probabilities of seen co-occurrences of dis tributionally similar events.Other potential applications apply the hy pothesised relationship (Harris, 1968) betweendistributional similarity and semantic similar ity; i.e., similarity in the meaning of words can be predicted from their distributional similarity.One advantage of automatically generated the sauruses (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998; Curranand Moens, 2002) over large-scale manually cre ated thesauruses such as WordNet (Fellbaum,1998) is that they might be tailored to a partic ular genre or domain.However, due to the lack of a tight defini tion for the concept of distributional similarity and the broad range of potential applications, alarge number of measures of distributional similarity have been proposed or adopted (see Section 2).</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">Previous work on the evaluation of dis tributional similarity methods tends to either compare sets of distributionally similar words to a manually created semantic resource (Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002) or be orientedtowards a particular task such as language mod elling (Dagan et al, 1999; Lee, 1999).</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">The first approach is not ideal since it assumes that the goal of distributional similarity methods is topredict semantic similarity and that the semantic resource used is a valid gold standard.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Further, the second approach is clearly advanta geous when one wishes to apply distributional similarity methods in a particular application area.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">However, it is not at all obvious that oneuniversally best measure exists for all applica tions (Weeds and Weir, 2003).</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">Thus, applying adistributional similarity technique to a new ap plication necessitates evaluating a large number of distributional similarity measures in addition to evaluating the new model or algorithm.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">We propose a shift in focus from attemptingto discover the overall best distributional sim ilarity measure to analysing the statistical and linguistic properties of sets of distributionally similar words returned by different measures.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">This will make it possible to predict in advanceof any experimental evaluation which distributional similarity measures might be most appro priate for a particular application.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">Further, we explore a problem faced by the automatic thesaurus generation community, which is that distributional similarity methodsdo not seem to offer any obvious way to distinguish between the semantic relations of syn onymy, antonymy and hyponymy.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">Previous work on this problem (Caraballo, 1999; Lin et al., 2003) involves identifying specific phrasal patterns within text e.g., ?Xs and other Ys?</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">is used as evidence that X is a hyponym of Y. Our work explores the connection between relativefrequency, distributional generality and seman tic generality with promising results.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">The rest of this paper is organised as follows.In Section 2, we present ten distributional simi larity measures that have been proposed for use in NLP.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">In Section 3, we analyse the variation in neighbour sets returned by these measures.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">In Section 4, we take one fundamental statisticalproperty (word frequency) and analyse correla tion between this and the nearest neighbour setsgenerated.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">In Section 5, we relate relative fre quency to a concept of distributional generalityand the semantic relation of hyponymy.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">In Sec tion 6, we consider the effects that this has on a potential application of distributional similarity techniques, which is judging compositionality of collocations.</S>

	<SECTION title="Distributional similarity measures. " number="2">
			<S sid="23" ssid="1">In this section, we introduce some basic con cepts and then discuss the ten distributional similarity measures used in this study.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="2">The co-occurrence types of a target word are the contexts, c, in which it occurs and these have associated frequencies which may be used to form probability estimates.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="3">In our work, theco-occurrence types are always grammatical de pendency relations.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="4">For example, in Sections 3 to 5, similarity between nouns is derived fromtheir co-occurrences with verbs in the direct object position.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="5">In Section 6, similarity between verbs is derived from their subjects and objects.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="6">The k nearest neighbours of a target word w are the k words for which similarity with w is greatest.</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="7">Our use of the term similarity measure encompasses measures which should strictly bereferred to as distance, divergence or dissimilar ity measures.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="8">An increase in distance correlates with a decrease in similarity.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="9">However, eithertype of measure can be used to find the k near est neighbours of a target word.Table 1 lists ten distributional similarity mea sures.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="10">The cosine measure (Salton and McGill, 1983) returns the cosine of the angle between two vectors.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="11">The Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure (Rao, 1983) and the ?-skew divergence measure (Lee, 1999) are based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="12">The KL divergence,or relative entropy, D(p||q), between two prob ability distribution functions p and q is defined (Cover and Thomas, 1991) as the ?inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is q when the true distribution is p?: D(p||q) = ? c p log p q .However, D(p||q) = ? if there are any con texts c for which p(c) &gt; 0 and q(c) = 0.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="13">Thus,this measure cannot be used directly on maxi mum likelihood estimate (MLE) probabilities.One possible solution is to use the JS diver gence measure, which measures the cost of usingthe average distribution in place of each individual distribution.</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="14">Another is the ?-skew diver gence measure, which uses the p distribution tosmooth the q distribution.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="15">The value of the pa rameter ? controls the extent to which the KL divergence is approximated.</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="16">We use ? = 0.99 since this provides a close approximation to the KL divergence and has been shown to provide good results in previous research (Lee, 2001).</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="17">The confusion probability (Sugawara et al, 1985) is an estimate of the probability that one word can be substituted for another.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="18">Words w1 and w2 are completely confusable if we are equally as likely to see w2 in a given context as we are to see w1 in that context.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="19">Jaccard?s coefficient (Salton and McGill,1983) calculates the proportion of features be longing to either word that are shared by both words.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="20">In the simplest case, the features of a word are defined as the contexts in which it has been seen to occur.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="21">simja+mi is a variant (Lin, 1998) in which the features of a word are thosecontexts for which the pointwise mutual infor mation (MI) between the word and the context is positive, where MI can be calculated usingI(c, w) = log P (c|w)P (c) . The related Dice Coeffi cient (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992) is omitted here since it has been shown (van Rijsbergen, 1979) that Dice and Jaccard?s Coefficients are monotonic in each other.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="22">Lin?s Measure (Lin, 1998) is based on his information-theoretic similarity theorem, whichstates, ?the similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio between the amount of in formation needed to state the commonality of A and B and the information needed to fully describe what A and B are.?</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="23">The final three measures are settings in the additive MI-based Co-occurrence Retrieval Model (AMCRM) (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Weeds, 2003).</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="24">We can measure the precisionand the recall of a potential neighbour?s re trieval of the co-occurrences of the target word,where the sets of required and retrieved co occurrences (F (w1) and F (w2) respectively) are those co-occurrences for which MI is positive.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="25">Neighbours with both high precision and high recall retrieval can be obtained by computing Measure Function cosine simcm(w2, w1) = ? c P (c|w1).P (c|w2) ??</S>

			<S sid="55" ssid="2">We now con sider whether there is substantial variation ina word?s distributionally nearest neighbours ac cording to the chosen measure.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="3">We do this by calculating the overlap between neighbour setsfor 2000 nouns generated using different mea sures from direct-object data extracted from the British National Corpus (BNC).</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="4">3.1 Experimental set-up.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="5">The data from which sets of nearest neighbours are derived is direct-object data for 2000 nouns extracted from the BNC using a robust accurate statistical parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="6">For reasons of computational efficiency,we limit ourselves to 2000 nouns and directobject relation data.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="7">Given the goal of comparing neighbour sets generated by different mea sures, we would not expect these restrictions to affect our findings.</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="8">The complete set of 2000 nouns (WScomp) is the union of two sets WShigh and WSlow for which nouns were selected on the basis of frequency: WShigh contains the 1000 most frequently occurring nouns (frequency &gt; 500), and WSlow contains the nouns ranked 3001-4000 (frequency ? 100).</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="9">By excludingmid-frequency nouns, we obtain a clear sepa ration between high and low frequency nouns.The complete data-set consists of 1,596,798 cooccurrence tokens distributed over 331,079 co occurrence types.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="10">From this data, we computedthe similarity between every pair of nouns according to each distributional similarity mea sure.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="11">We then generated ranked sets of nearest neighbours (of size k = 200 and where a word is excluded from being a neighbour of itself) for each word and each measure.For a given word, we compute the overlap between neighbour sets using a comparison tech nique adapted from Lin (1998).</S>

			<S sid="81" ssid="1">We have seen that there is a large variation inneighbours selected by different similarity mea sures.</S>
			<S sid="82" ssid="2">In this section, we analyse how neighboursets vary with respect to one fundamental statis tical property ? word frequency.</S>
			<S sid="83" ssid="3">To do this, we measure the bias in neighbour sets towards high frequency nouns and consider how this varies depending on whether the target noun is itself a high frequency noun or low frequency noun.</S>
			<S sid="84" ssid="4">4.1 Measuring bias.</S>
			<S sid="85" ssid="5">If a measure is biased towards selecting high frequency words as neighbours, then we would ex pect that neighbour sets for this measure wouldbe made up mainly of words from WShigh.</S>
			<S sid="86" ssid="6">Fur ther, the more biased the measure is, the more highly ranked these high frequency words will tend to be.</S>
			<S sid="87" ssid="7">In other words, there will be highoverlap between neighbour sets generated con sidering all 2000 nouns as potential neighbours and neighbour sets generated considering just the nouns in WShigh as potential neighbours.</S>
			<S sid="88" ssid="8">In the extreme case, where all of a noun?s k nearestneighbours are high frequency nouns, the over lap with the high frequency noun neighbour set will be 1 and the overlap with the low frequency noun neighbour set will be 0.</S>
			<S sid="89" ssid="9">The inverse is, ofcourse, true if a measure is biased towards se lecting low frequency words as neighbours.</S>
			<S sid="90" ssid="10">If NSwordset is the vector of neighbours (and associated rank scores) for a given word, w, andsimilarity measure, m, and generated considering just the words in wordset as potential neigh bours, then the overlap between two neighboursets can be computed using a cosine (as be fore).</S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="11">If Chigh = C(NScomp,NShigh) and Clow =C(NScomp,NSlow), then we compute the bias towards high frequency neighbours for word w us ing measure m as: biashighm(w) = Chigh Chigh+Clow The value of this normalised score lies in the range [0,1] where 1 indicates a neighbour set completely made up of high frequency words, 0 indicates a neighbour set completely made up oflow frequency words and 0.5 indicates a neighbour set with no biases towards high or low fre quency words.</S>

			<S sid="98" ssid="18">Table 4 shows the mean value of the biashigh score for every measure calculated over the set of high frequency nouns and over the set of low frequency nouns.</S>

			<S sid="100" ssid="20">Any deviation from 0.5 of greater than 0.0234 is significant at the 1% level.</S>
			<S sid="101" ssid="21">For all measures and both sets of target nouns, there appear to be strong tendencies toselect neighbours of particular frequencies.</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="22">Further, there appears to be three classes of mea sures: those that select high frequency nouns as neighbours regardless of the frequency of thetarget noun (cm, js, ?, cp andR); those that select low frequency nouns as neighbours regard less of the frequency of the target noun (P); and those that select nouns of a similar frequency to the target noun (ja, ja+mi, lin and hm).This can also be considered in terms of distri butional generality.</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="23">By definition, recall preferswords that have occurred in more of the con texts that the target noun has, regardless of whether it occurs in other contexts as well i.e., it prefers distributionally more general words.</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="24">The probability of this being the case increasesas the frequency of the potential neighbour increases and so, recall tends to select high fre quency words.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="25">In contrast, precision prefers words that have occurred in very few contextsthat the target word has not i.e., it prefers distributionally more specific words.</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="26">The prob ability of this being the case increases as the frequency of the potential neighbour decreases and so, precision tends to select low frequencywords.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="27">The harmonic mean of precision and re call prefers words that have both high precision and high recall.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="28">The probability of this beingthe case is highest when the words are of sim ilar frequency and so, the harmonic mean will tend to select words of a similar frequency.</S>

	<SECTION title="Relative frequency and hyponymy. " number="5">
			<S sid="109" ssid="1">In this section, we consider the observed fre quency effects from a semantic perspective.The concept of distributional generality in troduced in the previous section has parallels with the linguistic relation of hyponymy, where a hypernym is a semantically more general term and a hyponym is a semantically more specificterm.</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="2">For example, animal is an (indirect1) hypernym of dog and conversely dog is an (indi rect) hyponym of animal.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="3">Although one can obviously think of counter-examples, we would generally expect that the more specific term dog can only be used in contexts where animal can be used and that the more general term animal might be used in all of the contexts where dogis used and possibly others.</S>
			<S sid="112" ssid="4">Thus, we might ex pect that distributional generality is correlated with semantic generality ? a word has high recall/low precision retrieval of its hyponyms?co-occurrences and high precision/low recall re trieval of its hypernyms?</S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="5">co-occurrences.</S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="6">Thus, if n1 and n2 are related and P(n2, n1) &gt;R(n2, n1), we might expect that n2 is a hy ponym of n1 and vice versa.</S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="7">However, having discussed a connection between frequency and distributional generality, we might also expect to find that the frequency of the hypernymic term is greater than that of the hyponymicterm.</S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="8">In order to test these hypotheses, we ex tracted all of the possible hyponym-hypernym pairs (20, 415 pairs in total) from our list of 2000 nouns (using WordNet 1.6).</S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="9">We then calculatedthe proportion for which the direction of the hy ponymy relation could be accurately predicted by the relative values of precision and recall andthe proportion for which the direction of the hy ponymy relation could be accurately predictedby relative frequency.</S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="10">We found that the direc tion of the hyponymy relation is correlated in the predicted direction with the precision-recall 1There may be other concepts in the hypernym chain between dog and animal e.g. carnivore and mammal.values in 71% of cases and correlated in the pre dicted direction with relative frequency in 70% of cases.</S>
			<S sid="119" ssid="11">This supports the idea of a three-waylinking between distributional generality, rela tive frequency and semantic generality.</S>

			<S sid="123" ssid="3">Both types areimportant in language generation since a sys tem must choose between alternatives but onlynon-compositional ones are of interest in language understanding since only these colloca tions need to be listed in the dictionary.</S>
			<S sid="124" ssid="4">Baldwin et al (2003) explore empiricalmodels of compositionality for noun-noun com pounds and verb-particle constructions.</S>
			<S sid="125" ssid="5">Based on the observation (Haspelmath, 2002) that compositional collocations tend to be hyponyms of their head constituent, they propose a model which considers the semantic similarity between a collocation and its constituent words.McCarthy et al (2003) also investigate sev eral tests for compositionality including one (simplexscore) based on the observation that compositional collocations tend to be similar inmeaning to their constituent parts.</S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="6">They ex tract co-occurrence data for 111 phrasal verbs (e.g. rip off ) and their simplex constituents(e.g. rip) from the BNC using RASP and cal culate the value of simlin between each phrasal verb and its simplex constituent.</S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="7">The test simplexscore is used to rank the phrasal verbs according to their similarity with their simplexconstituent.</S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="8">This ranking is correlated with hu man judgements of the compositionality of the phrasal verbs using Spearman?s rank correlationcoefficient.</S>
			<S sid="129" ssid="9">The value obtained (0.0525) is dis appointing since it is not statistically significant(the probability of this value under the null hy pothesis of ?no correlation?</S>
			<S sid="130" ssid="10">is 0.3).2 However, Haspelmath (2002) notes that a compositional collocation is not just similar to one of its constituents ? it can be considered tobe a hyponym of its head constituent.</S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="11">For ex ample, ?strong tea?</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="12">is a type of ?tea?</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="13">and ?to2Other tests for compositionality investigated by Mc Carthy et al (2003) do much better.</S>

			<S sid="136" ssid="16">Thus, we hypothesised that a distributional measure which tends to select more generalterms as neighbours of the phrasal verb (e.g. re call) would do better than measures that tend to select more specific terms (e.g. precision) or measures that tend to select terms of a similar specificity (e.g simlin or the harmonic mean of precision and recall).</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="17">Table 5 shows the results of using different similarity measures with the simplexscore test and data of McCarthy et al (2003).</S>
			<S sid="138" ssid="18">We now see significant correlation between compositionality judgements and distributional similarity of thephrasal verb and its head constituent.</S>
			<S sid="139" ssid="19">The cor relation using the recall measure is significant at the 5% level; thus we can conclude that if the simplex verb has high recall retrieval of the phrasal verb?s co-occurrences, then the phrasal is likely to be compositional.</S>
			<S sid="140" ssid="20">The correlation score using the precision measure is negative since we would not expect the simplex verb to be a hyponym of the phrasal verb and thus, ifthe simplex verb does have high precision re trieval of the phrasal verb?s co-occurrences, it is less likely to be compositional.</S>
			<S sid="141" ssid="21">Finally, we obtained a very similar result (0.217) by ranking phrasals according to their inverse relative frequency with their simplex constituent (i.e., freq(simplex)freq(phrasal) ).</S>
			<S sid="142" ssid="22">Thus, it would seem that the three-way connection betweendistributional generality, hyponymy and rela tive frequency exists for verbs as well as nouns.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusions and further work. " number="7">
			<S sid="143" ssid="1">We have presented an analysis of a set of dis tributional similarity measures.</S>
			<S sid="144" ssid="2">We have seen that there is a large amount of variation in the neighbours selected by different measures andtherefore the choice of measure in a given appli cation is likely to be important.</S>
			<S sid="145" ssid="3">We also identified one of the major axes ofvariation in neighbour sets as being the fre quency of the neighbours selected relative to the frequency of the target word.</S>
			<S sid="146" ssid="4">There are threemajor classes of distributional similarity mea sures which can be characterised as 1) higher frequency selecting or high recall measures; 2)lower frequency selecting or high precision mea sures; and 3) similar frequency selecting or high precision and recall measures.</S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="5">A word tends to have high recall similarity with its hyponyms and high precision similarity with its hypernyms.</S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="6">Further, in the majority ofcases, it tends to be more frequent than its hy ponyms and less frequent than its hypernyms.Thus, there would seem to a three way corre lation between word frequency, distributional generality and semantic generality.We have considered the impact of these observations on a technique which uses a distributional similarity measure to determine compositionality of collocations.</S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="7">We saw that in this ap plication we achieve significantly better resultsusing a measure that tends to select higher frequency words as neighbours rather than a mea sure that tends to select neighbours of a similar frequency to the target word.</S>
			<S sid="150" ssid="8">There are a variety of ways in which this workmight be extended.</S>
			<S sid="151" ssid="9">First, we could use the ob servations about distributional generality andrelative frequency to aid the process of organising distributionally similar words into hierar chies.</S>
			<S sid="152" ssid="10">Second, we could consider the impact of frequency characteristics in other applications.Third, for the general application of distribu tional similarity measures, it would be usefulto find other characteristics by which distribu tional similarity measures might be classified.</S>
