SemEval-2007 Task 07: Coarse-Grained English All-Words Task
This paper presents the coarse-grained English all-words task at SemEval-2007.
We describe our experience in producing a coarse version of the WordNet sense inventory and preparing the sense-tagged corpus for the task.
We present the results of participating systems and discuss future directions.
We show that the performance of WSD systems clearly indicates that WSD is not easy unless one adopts a coarse-grained approach, and then systems tagging all words at best perform a few percentage points above the most frequent sense heuristic (Navigli et al, 2007).
