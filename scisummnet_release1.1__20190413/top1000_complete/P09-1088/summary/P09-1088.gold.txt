A Gibbs Sampler for Phrasal Synchronous Grammar Induction
We present a phrasal synchronous grammar model of translational equivalence.
Unlike previous approaches, we do not resort to heuristics or constraints from a word-alignment model, but instead directly induce a synchronous grammar from parallel sentence-aligned corpora.
We use a hierarchical Bayesian prior to bias towards compact grammars with small translation units.
Inference is performed using a novel Gibbs sampler over synchronous derivations.
This sampler side-steps the intractability issues of previous models which required inference over derivation forests.
Instead each sampling iteration is highly efficient, allowing the model to be applied to larger translation corpora than previous approaches.
We use Gibbs sampler for learning the SCFG by reasoning over the space of derivations (Blunsom et al, 2009).
We present a method for maintaining table counts without needing to record the table assignments for each translation decision.
We apply the technique of using multiple processors to perform approximate Gibbs sampling which we show achieve equivalent performance to the exact Gibbs sampler.
