Empirical Lower Bounds On The Complexity Of Translational Equivalence
This paper describes a study of the patterns of translational equivalence exhibited by a variety of bitexts.
The study found that the complexity of these patterns in every bitext was higher than suggested in the literature.
These findings shed new light on why syntactic constraints have not helped to improve statistical translation models, including finite-state phrase-based models, tree-to-string models, and tree-to-tree models.
The paper also presents evidence that inversion transduction grammars cannot generate some translational equivalence relations, even in relatively simple real bitexts in syntactically similar languages with rigid word order.
Our methodology measures the complexity of word alignment using the number of gaps that are necessary for their synchronous parser which allows discontinuous spans to succeed in parsing.
Translational equivalence is a mathematical relation that holds between linguistic expressions with the same meaning.
We argue for the necessity of discontinuous spans (i.e., for a formalism beyond Synchronous CFG) in order for synchronous parsing to cover human-annotated word alignment data under the constraint that rules have a rank of no more than two.
