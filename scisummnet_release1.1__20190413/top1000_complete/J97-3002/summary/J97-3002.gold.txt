Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars And Bilingual Parsing Of Parallel Corpora
We introduce (1) a novel stochastic inversion transduction grammar formalism for bilingual language modeling of sentence-pairs, and (2) the concept of bilingual parsing with a variety of parallel corpus analysis applications.
Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm.
A convenient normal form is shown to exist.
Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints.
We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing.
We use an inside-outside type of training algorithm to learn statistical context free transduction.
Our Bilingual Bracketing is one of the bilingual shallow parsing approaches studied for Chinese-English word alignment.
We introduce a polynomial-time solution for the alignment problem based on synchronous binary trees.
