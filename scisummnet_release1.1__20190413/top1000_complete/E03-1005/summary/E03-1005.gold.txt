An Efficient Implementation Of A New DOP Model
Two apparently opposing DOP models exist in the literature: one which computes the parse tree involving the most frequent subtrees from a treebank and one which computes the parse tree involving the fewest subtrees from a treebank.
This paper proposes an integration of the two models which outperforms each of them separately.
Together with a PCFG-reduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank.
Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.
We note that it is the highest ranking parse, not derivation, that is desired.
We show that DOP models that select the preferred parse of a test sentence using the shortest derivation criterion perform very well.
We redress subtree probabilit by a simple correction factor.
