Regular Models Of Phonological Rule Systems
This paper presents a set of mathematical and computational tools for manipulating and reasoning about regular languages and regular relations and argues that they provide a solid basis for computational phonology.
It shows in detail how this framework applies to ordered sets of context-sensitive rewriting rules and also to grammars in Koskenniemi's two-level formalism.
This analysis provides a common representation of phonological constraints that supports efficient generation and recognition by a single simple interpreter.
we provide an algorithm for compilation into transducers.
we describe a general method representing a replacement procedure as finite-state transduction.
