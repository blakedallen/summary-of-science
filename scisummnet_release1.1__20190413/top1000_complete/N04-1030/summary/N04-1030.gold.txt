Shallow Semantic Parsing Using Support Vector Machines
In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm for shallow semantic parsing, extending the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Surdeanu et al. (2003) and others.
Our algorithm is based on Support Vector Machines which we show give an improvement in performance over earlier classifiers.
We show performance improvements through a number of new features and measure their ability to generalize to a new test set drawn from the AQUAINT corpus.
We first build a parse tree, and syntactic constituents are then labeled by feeding hand-built features extracted from the parse tree to a machine learning system.
