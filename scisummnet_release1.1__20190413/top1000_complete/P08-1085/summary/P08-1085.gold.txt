EM Can Find Pretty Good HMM POS-Taggers (When Given a Good Start)
We address the task of unsupervised POS tagging.
We demonstrate that good results can be obtained using the robust EM-HMM learner when provided with good initial conditions, even with incomplete dictionaries.
We present a family of algorithms to compute effective initial estimations p(t|w).
We test the method on the task of full morphological disambiguation in Hebrew achieving an error reduction of 25% over a strong uniform distribution baseline.
We also test the same method on the standard WSJ unsupervised POS tagging task and obtain results competitive with recent state-of-the-art methods, while using simple and efficient learning methods.
We use linguistic considerations for choosing a good starting point for the EM algorithm.
We note that fixing noisy dictionaries by hand is actually quite feasible, and suggest that effort should focus on exploiting human knowledge rather than just algorithmic improvements.
