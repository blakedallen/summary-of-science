Identifying Relations for Open Information Extraction
Open Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting assertions from massive corpora without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary.
This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions.
To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs.
We implemented the constraints in the REVERB Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TEXTRUNNER and WOEpos.
More than 30% of REVERB’s extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher compared to virtually none for earlier systems.
The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of REVERB’s errors, suggesting directions for future work.
We show that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations.
We develop a large scale web-based ReVerb corpus, comprising tuple extractions of predicate templates with their argument instantiations.
Our ReVerb corpus is a large scale publicly available web based open extractions data set, containing about 15 million unique template extractions, automatically extracted from the ClueWeb09 web crawl.
