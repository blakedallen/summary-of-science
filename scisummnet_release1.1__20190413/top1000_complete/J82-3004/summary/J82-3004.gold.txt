Coping With Syntactic Ambiguity Or How To Put The Block In The Box On The Table
Sentences are far more ambiguous than one might have thought.
There may be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of syntactic parse trees for certain very natural sentences of English.
This fact has been a major problem confronting natural language processing, especially when a large percentage of the syntactic parse trees are enumerated during semantic/pragmatic processing.
In this paper we propose some methods for dealing with syntactic ambiguity in ways that exploit certain regularities among alternative parse trees.
These regularities will be expressed as linear combinations of ATN networks, and also as sums and products of formal power series.
We believe that such encoding of ambiguity will enhance processing, whether syntactic and semantic constraints are processed separately in sequence or interleaved together.
The number of possible binary-branching parses of a sentence is defined by the Catalan number, an exponential combinatoric function.
