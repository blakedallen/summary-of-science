Latent Semantic Analysis For Text Segmentation
This paper describes a method for linear text segmentation that is more accurate or at least as accurate as state-of-the-art methods (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Choi, 2000a).
Inter-sentence similarity is estimated by latent semantic analysis (LSA).
Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.
Test results show LSA is a more accurate similarity measure.
We use all vocabulary words to compute low-dimensional document vectors.
