Automatic Error Detection In The Japanese Learners' English Spoken Data
This paper describes a method of detecting grammatical and lexical errors made by Japanese learners of English and other techniques that improve the accuracy of error detection with a limited amount of training data.
In this paper, we demonstrate to what extent the proposed methods hold promise by conducting experiments using our learner corpus, which contains information on learners' errors.
We use error annotated transcripts of Japanese speakers in an interview-based test of spoken English to train a maximum entropy classifier to recognize 13 different types of grammatical and lexical errors, including errors involving prepositions.
In the Japanese Learners of English corpus (Izumi et al., 2003), errors related to verbs are among the most frequent categories.
The usage of articles has been found to be the most frequent error class in the JLE (Japanese Learner English) corpus.
