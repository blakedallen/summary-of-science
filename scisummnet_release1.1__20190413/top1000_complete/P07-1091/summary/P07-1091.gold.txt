A Probabilistic Approach to Syntax-based Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation
Inspired by previous preprocessing approaches to SMT, this paper proposes a novel, probabilistic approach to reordering which combines the merits of syntax and phrase-based SMT.
Given a source sentence and its parse tree, our method generates, by tree operations, an n-best list of reordered inputs, which are then fed to standard phrase-based decoder to produce the optimal translation.
Experiments show that, for the NIST MT-05 task of Chinese-to-English translation, the proposal leads to BLEU improvement of 1.56%.
We use a maximum entropy system to learn reordering rules for binary trees (i.e., whether to keep or reorder for each node).
We model reordering on parse tree nodes by using a maximum entropy model with surface and syntactic features for Chinese-to-English translation.
