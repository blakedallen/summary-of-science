Sentence Level Discourse Parsing Using Syntactic And Lexical Information
We introduce two probabilistic models that can be used to identify elementary discourse units and build sentence-level discourse parse trees.
The models use syntactic and lexical features.
A discourse parsing algorithm that implements these models derives discourse parse trees with an error reduction of 18.8% over a state-of-the-art decision-based discourse parser.
A set of empirical evaluations shows that our discourse parsing model is sophisticated enough to yield discourse trees at an accuracy level that matches near-human levels of performance.
within Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), we have developed two probabilistic models for identifying clausal elementary discourse units and generating discourse trees at the sentence level.
We introduce a statistical discourse segmenter, which is trained on RST DT to label words with boundary or no-boundary labels.
