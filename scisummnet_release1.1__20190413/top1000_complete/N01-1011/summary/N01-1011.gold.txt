A Decision Tree Of Bigrams Is An Accurate Predictor Of Word Sense
This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation where a decision tree assigns a sense to an ambiguous word based on the bigrams that occur nearby.
This approach is evaluated using the sense-tagged corpora from the 1998 SENSEVAL word sense disambiguation exercise.
It is more accurate than the average results reported for 30 of 36 words, and is more accurate than the best results for 19 of 36 words.
We compare decision trees, decision stumps and a Naive Bayesian classifier to show that bigrams are very useful in identifying the intended sense of a word.
