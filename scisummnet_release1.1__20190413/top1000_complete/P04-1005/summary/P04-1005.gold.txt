A TAG-Based Noisy-Channel Model Of Speech Repairs
This paper describes a noisy channel model of speech repairs, which can identify and correct repairs in speech transcripts.
A syntactic parser is used as the source model, and a novel type of TAG-based transducer is the channel model.
The use of TAG is motivated by the intuition that the reparandum is a "rough copy" of the repair.
The model is trained and tested on the Switchboard disfluency-annotated corpus.
Noisy channel models do well on the disfluency detection task.
Although the standard noisy channel model performs well, a log linear re-ranker can be used to increase performance.
Our TAG system achieves a high EDIT-F score, largely as a result of its explicit tracking of overlapping words between reparanda and alterations.
