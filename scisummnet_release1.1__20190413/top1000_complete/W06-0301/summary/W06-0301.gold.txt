Extracting Opinions Opinion Holders And Topics Expressed In Online News Media Text
This paper presents a method for identifying an opinion with its holder and topic, given a sentence from online news media texts.
We introduce an approach of exploiting the semantic structure of a sentence, anchored to an opinion bearing verb or adjective.
This method uses semantic role labeling as an intermediate step to label an opinion holder and topic using data from FrameNet.
We decompose our task into three phases: identifying an opinion-bearing word, labeling semantic roles related to the word in the sentence, and then finding the holder and the topic of the opinion word among the labeled semantic roles.
For a broader coverage, we also employ a clustering technique to predict the most probable frame for a word which is not defined in FrameNet.
Our experimental results show that our system performs significantly better than the baseline.
we identify opinion holders and targets with semantic role labeling.
