Fully Unsupervised Discovery of Concept-Specific Relationships by Web Mining
We present a web mining method for discovering and enhancing relationships in which a specified concept (word class) participates.
We discover a whole range of relationships focused on the given concept, rather than generic known relationships as in most previous work.
Our method is based on clustering patterns that contain concept words and other words related to them.
We evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision.
We introduce the use of term frequency patterns for relationship discovery.
As a pre-requisite to extracting relations among pairs of classes, our method extracts class instances from unstructured Web documents, by submitting pairs of instances as queries and analyzing the contents of the top 1,000 documents returned by a Web search engine.
We propose a method for unsupervised discovery of concept specific relations, requiring initial word seeds.
