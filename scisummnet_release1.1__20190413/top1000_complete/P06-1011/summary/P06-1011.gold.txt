Extracting Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments From Non-Parallel Corpora
We present a novel method for extracting parallel sub-sentential fragments from comparable, non-parallel bilingual corpora.
By analyzing potentially similar sentence pairs using a signal processing-inspired approach, we detect which segments of the source sentence are translated into segments in the target sentence, and which are not.
This method enables us to extract useful machine translation training data even from very non-parallel corpora, which contain no parallel sentence pairs.
We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.
We first use the GI ZA++ (with grow-diag-final-and heuristic) to obtain the word alignment between source and target words, and then calculate the association strength between the aligned words.
We first extract the candidate parallel sentences from the comparable corpora and further extract the accurate sub-sentential bilingual fragments from the candidate parallel sentences using the in-domain probabilistic bilingual lexicon.
We use standard information retrieval together with simple word-based translation for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR), and extract phrases from the retrieval results using a clean bilingual lexicon and an averaging filter.
We perform phrase extraction by combining clean alignment lexica for initial signals with heuristics to smooth alignments for final fragment extraction.
