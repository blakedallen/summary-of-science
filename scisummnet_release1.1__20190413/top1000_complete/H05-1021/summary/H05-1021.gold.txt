Local Phrase Reordering Models For Statistical Machine Translation
We describe stochastic models of local phrase movement that can be incorporated into a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system.
These models provide properly formulated, non-deficient, probability distributions over reordered phrase sequences.
They are implemented by Weighted Finite State Transducers.
We describe EM-style parameter re-estimation procedures based on phrase alignment under the complete translation model incorporating reordering.
Our experiments show that the reordering model yields substantial improvements in translation performance on Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English MT tasks.
We also show that the procedure scales as the bitext size is increased.
We present a polynomial-time strategy.
We define two local reordering models for their Translation Template Model (TTM): In the first one, called MJ-1, only adjacent phrases are allowed to swap, and the movement has to be done within a window of 2.
