A Semantic Approach To IE Pattern Induction
This paper presents a novel algorithm for the acquisition of Information Extraction patterns.
The approach makes the assumption that useful patterns will have similar meanings to those already identified as relevant.
Patterns are compared using a variation of the standard vector space model in which information from an ontology is used to capture semantic similarity.
Evaluation shows this algorithm performs well when compared with a previously reported document-centric approach.
We propose a weakly supervised approach to sentence filtering that uses semantic similarity and bootstrapping to acquire IE patterns.
We use subject-verb-object triples for the features.
