Maximum Entropy Based Phrase Reordering Model For Statistical Machine Translation
We propose a novel reordering model for phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) that uses a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to predicate reorderings of neighbor blocks (phrase pairs).
The model provides content-dependent, hierarchical phrasal reordering with generalization based on features automatically learned from a real-world bitext.
We present an algorithm to extract all reordering events of neighbor blocks from bilingual data.
In our experiments on Chinese-to-English translation, this MaxEnt-based reordering model obtains significant improvements in BLEU score on the NIST MT-05 and IWSLT-04 tasks.
We improve the reordering model for SMT based on the collocated words crossing the neighboring components.
We propose a constituent reordering model for a bracketing transduction grammar (BTG) (Wu, 1995), which predicts the probability that a pair of subconstituents will reorder when combined to form a new constituent.
In our maximum entropy-based reordering model, MEBTG, three rules are used to derive the translation of each sub sentence: lexical rule, straight rule and inverted rule.
