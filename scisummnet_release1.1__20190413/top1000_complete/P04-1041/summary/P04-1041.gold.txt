Long-Distance Dependency Resolution In Automatically Acquired Wide-Coverage PCFG-Based LFG Approximations
This paper shows how finite approximations of long distance dependency (LDD) resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) resources acquired from treebanks.
We extract LFG subcategorisation frames and paths linking LDD reentrancies from f-structures generated automatically for the Penn-II treebank trees and use them in an LDD resolution algorithm to parse new text.
Unlike (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 2002), in our approach resolution of LDDs is done at f-structure (attribute-value structure representations of basic predicate-argument or dependency structure) without empty productions, traces and coindexation in CFG parse trees.
Currently our best automatically induced grammars achieve 80.97% f-score for f-structures parsing section 23 of the WSJ part of the Penn-II treebank and evaluating against the DCU 1051 and 80.24% against the PARC 700 Dependency Bank (King et al., 2003), performing at the same or a slightly better level than state-of-the-art hand-crafted grammars (Kaplan et al., 2004).
Our f-structure annotation algorithm used for inducing LFG resources from the Penn-II treebank for English uses configurational, categorial, function tag and trace information.
We automatically map c-structures to f-structures by assigning grammatical functions to tree nodes based on their phrasal category, the category of the mother node and their position relative to the local head.
Our parser automatically annotates input text with c-structure trees and f-structure dependencies, reaching high precision and recall rates.
