    <S sid="10" ssid="10">In developing DTG we have tried to overcome these problems while remaining faithto what we see as the key advantages of particular, its enlarged domain of locality).</S>
    <S sid="11" ssid="11">In Section 1.3 we introduce some of the key features of explain how they are intended to address problems that we have identified with 1.1 Derivations and Dependencies operations of substitution and adjunction relate two lexical items.</S>
    <S sid="12" ssid="12">It is therefore natural to interpret these operations as establishing a direct linguistic relation between the two lexical items, namely a relation of complementation (predicateargument relation) or of modification.</S>
    <S sid="13" ssid="13">In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit.</S>
    <S sid="14" ssid="14">However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes &amp; Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate constraints in many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made &amp; Kaplan, 1982) provides a separate functional (f-) structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g.</S>
    <S sid="15" ssid="15">Mel'euk (1988)) use these notions as the principal basis for syntactic representation.</S>
    <S sid="16" ssid="16">We will follow the dependency literature in referring to complementation and modification as syntactic dependency.</S>
    <S sid="17" ssid="17">As observed by Rambow and Joshi (1992), for TAG, the importance of the dependency structure means that not only the derived phrase-structure tree is of interest, but also the operations by which we obtained it from elementary structures.</S>
    <S sid="18" ssid="18">This information is encoded in the derivation tree (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).</S>
    <S sid="19" ssid="19">However, as Vijay-Shanker (1992) observes, the operations are not used uniformly: while substitution is used only to add a (nominal) complement, adjunction is used both for modification and (clausal) complementation.</S>
    <S sid="20" ssid="20">Clausal complementation could not be handled uniformly by substitution because of the existence of syntactic such as in English.</S>
    <S sid="21" ssid="21">Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in 151 the directionality of the operations used for complementation in TAG@: nominal complements are substituted into their governing verb's tree, while the governing verb's tree is adjoined into its own clausal complement.</S>
    <S sid="22" ssid="22">The fact that adjunction and substitution are used in a linguistically heterogeneous manner means that (standard) TAG derivation trees do not provide a good representation of the dependencies between the words of the sentence, i.e., of the predicate-argument and modification structure. adore SUBJ COMP Figure 1: Derivation trees for (1): original definition (left); Schabes &amp; Shieber definition (right) For instance, English sentence (1) gets the derivation structure shown on the left in Figure 1'. spicy hotdogs he claims Mary seems to adore When comparing this derivation structure to the dependency structure in Figure 2, the following problems become apparent.</S>

    <S sid="24" ssid="24">This gives us the derivation structure shown on the right in Figure 1.</S>
    <S sid="25" ssid="25">While this might provide a satisfactory treatment of modification at the derivation level, there are now three types of operations (two adjunctions and substitution) for two types of dependencies (arguments and modifiers), and the directionality problem for embedded clauses remains unsolved. defining have attempted to resolve these problems with the use of a single operation (that we call subsertion) for handling all complementation and a second operation (called sisteradjunction) for modification.</S>
    <S sid="26" ssid="26">Before discussion these operations further we consider a second problem with TAG that has implications for the design of these new composition operations (in particular, subsertion).</S>
    <S sid="27" ssid="27">1.2 Problematic Constructions for TAG be used to provide suitable analyses for certain syntactic phenomena, including longdistance scrambling in German (Becker et al., 1991), Romance Clitics (Bleam, 1994), wh-extraction out of complex picture-NPs (Kroch, 1987), and Kashmiri wh-extraction (presented here).</S>
    <S sid="28" ssid="28">The problem in describing these phenomena with TAG arises from the fact (observed by Vijay-Shanker (1992)) that adjoining is an overly restricted way of combining structu- We illustrate the problem by considering Kashon Bhatt (1994). extraction in Kashmiri proceeds as in English, except that the wh-word ends up in sentence-second position, with a topic from the matrix clause in sentence-initial position.</S>

    <S sid="31" ssid="31">Since the moved element does not appear in sentence-initial position, the TAG analysis of English wit-extraction of Kroch (1987; 1989) (in which the matrix clause is adjoined into the embedded clause) cannot be transferred, and in fact no linguistically plausible TAG analysis appears to be available.</S>
    <S sid="32" ssid="32">In the past, variants of TAG have been developed to extend the range of possible analyses.</S>
    <S sid="33" ssid="33">In Multi-Component TAG (MCTAG) (Joshi, 1987), trees are grouped into sets which must be adjoined to- (multicomponent adjunction).</S>

    <S sid="35" ssid="35">Domination et al., 1991) are multicomponent systems that allow for the expression of dominance constraints.</S>
    <S sid="36" ssid="36">However, MCTAG-DL share a further problem with MCTAG: the derivation structures cannot be given a linguistically meaningful interpretation.</S>
    <S sid="37" ssid="37">Thus, they fail to address the first prowe discussed (in Section 1.3 The DTG Approach Vijay-Shanker (1992) points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node' of the adjoined tree.</S>
    <S sid="38" ssid="38">However, adjunction (rather than substitution) is used since, in general, the structure that is substituted may only form part of the clausal complement: the remaining substructure of the clausal complement appears above the root of the adjoined tree.</S>
    <S sid="39" ssid="39">Unfortunately, as seen in the examples given in Section 1.2, there are cases where satisfactory analyses cannot be obtained with adjunction.</S>
    <S sid="40" ssid="40">In particular, using adjunction in this way cannot handle cases in which parts of the clausal complement are required to be placed within the structure of the adjoined tree. of subsertion is designed to overcome this limitation.</S>
    <S sid="41" ssid="41">Subsertion can be viewed as a generalization of adjunction in which components of the clausal complement (the subserted structure) which are not substituted can be interspersed within the structure that is the site of the subsertion.</S>
    <S sid="42" ssid="42">Following earlier work (Becker et al., Vijay-Shanker, 1992), a mechanism involving the use of domination links (d-edges) that ensure that parts of the subserted structure that are not substituted dominate those parts that are.</S>
    <S sid="43" ssid="43">Furthermore, there is a need to constrain the way in which the non-substituted components can be interspersed'.</S>
    <S sid="44" ssid="44">This is done by either using appropriate feature constraints at nodes or by means of subsertion-insertion constraints (see Section 2).</S>
    <S sid="45" ssid="45">We end this section by briefly commenting on the of sister-adjunction.</S>
    <S sid="46" ssid="46">In TAG, modification is performed with adjunction of modifier trees that have a highly constrained form.</S>
    <S sid="47" ssid="47">In particular, the foot nodes of these trees are always daughters of the root and either the leftmost or rightmost frontier nodes.</S>
    <S sid="48" ssid="48">The effect of adjoining a these cases the foot node is an argument node of the lexical anchor.</S>
    <S sid="49" ssid="49">'This was also observed by Rambow (1994a), where integrity constraint (first defined for an of TAG (Becker etal., 1991)) is defined for a MCTAG-DL version called V-TAG.</S>
    <S sid="50" ssid="50">However, this was found to be insufficient for treating both long-distance scrambling and long-distance topicalization in German.</S>
    <S sid="51" ssid="51">V-TAG retains adjoining (to handle topicalization) for this reason. tree of this form corresponds (almost) exactly to the addition of a new (leftmost or rightmost) subtree below the nede that was the site of the adjunction. this reason, we have equipped an operation (sister-adjunction) that does exactly this and more.</S>
    <S sid="52" ssid="52">From the definition of Section 2 it can be seen that the essential aspects of Schabes &amp; Shieber (1994) treatment for modification, including multiple modifications of a phrase, be captured by using this defining Section 2, we discuss, in Section 3, DTG analyses for the English and Kashmiri data presented in this section.</S>

    <S sid="54" ssid="54">2 Definition of D-Tree Grammars d-tree is a tree with two types of domination edges (d-edges) and immediate domination edges (i-edges).</S>
    <S sid="55" ssid="55">D-edges and i-edges express domination and immediate domination relations between nodes.</S>
    <S sid="56" ssid="56">These relations are never rescinded when dtrees are composed.</S>
    <S sid="57" ssid="57">Thus, nodes separated by an i-edge will remain in a mother-daughter relationship throughout the derivation, whereas nodes separated by an d-edge can be equated or have a path of any length inserted between them during a derivation.</S>
    <S sid="58" ssid="58">D-edges and i-edges are not distributed arbitrarily in d-trees.</S>
    <S sid="59" ssid="59">For each internal node, either all of its daughters are linked by i-edges or it has a single daughter that is linked to it by a d-edge.</S>
    <S sid="60" ssid="60">Each node is labelled with a terminal symbol, a nonterminal or the empty string. containing n can be decomposed into n + 1 containing only i-edges.</S>
    <S sid="61" ssid="61">D-trees can be composed using two operations: subsertion and sister-adjunction.</S>
    <S sid="62" ssid="62">When a d-tree is subserted into another d-tree component of a is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a node) and all components of a that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node.</S>
    <S sid="63" ssid="63">For example, consider the d-trees a and shown in Figure 3.</S>
    <S sid="64" ssid="64">Note that components are shown as triangles.</S>

    <S sid="75" ssid="1">We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree Grammars (DTG), which arises from work on TreeAdjoining Grammars (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975).</S>

    <S sid="81" ssid="7">The first problem (discussed in Section 1.1) is that the TAG operations of substitution and adjunction do not map cleanly onto the relations of complementation and modification.</S>

    <S sid="89" ssid="15">In many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made explicit: LFG (Bresnan &amp; Kaplan, 1982) provides a separate functional (f-) structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g.</S>

    <S sid="140" ssid="2">D-edges and i-edges express domination and immediate domination relations between nodes.</S>
    <S sid="141" ssid="3">These relations are never rescinded when dtrees are composed.</S>
    <S sid="142" ssid="4">Thus, nodes separated by an i-edge will remain in a mother-daughter relationship throughout the derivation, whereas nodes separated by an d-edge can be equated or have a path of any length inserted between them during a derivation.</S>
    <S sid="143" ssid="5">D-edges and i-edges are not distributed arbitrarily in d-trees.</S>
    <S sid="144" ssid="6">For each internal node, either all of its daughters are linked by i-edges or it has a single daughter that is linked to it by a d-edge.</S>
    <S sid="145" ssid="7">Each node is labelled with a terminal symbol, a nonterminal symbol or the empty string.</S>
    <S sid="146" ssid="8">A d-tree containing n d-edges can be decomposed into n + 1 components containing only i-edges.</S>
    <S sid="147" ssid="9">D-trees can be composed using two operations: subsertion and sister-adjunction.</S>
    <S sid="148" ssid="10">When a d-tree a is subserted into another d-tree fl, a component of a is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a substitution node) of and all components of a that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node.</S>
    <S sid="149" ssid="11">For example, consider the d-trees a and shown in Figure 3.</S>
    <S sid="150" ssid="12">Note that components are shown as triangles.</S>
    <S sid="151" ssid="13">In the composed d-tree 7 the component a(5) is substituted at a substitution node in /3.</S>
    <S sid="152" ssid="14">The components, a(1), a(2), and a(4) of a above a(5) drift up the path in which runs from the substitution node.</S>
    <S sid="153" ssid="15">These components are then inserted into d-edges in # or above the root of #.</S>
    <S sid="154" ssid="16">In general, when a component a(i) of some d-tree a is inserted into a d-edge between nodes ni and 772 two new d-edges are created, the first of which relates and the root node of a(i), and the second of which relates the frontier node of a(i) that dominates the substituted component to 772.</S>
    <S sid="155" ssid="17">It is possible for components above the substituted node to drift arbitrarily far up the d-tree and distribute themselves within domination edges, or above the root, in any way that is compatible with the domination relationships present in the substituted d-tree.</S>
    <S sid="156" ssid="18">DTG provide a mechanism called subsertion-insertion constraints to control what can appear within d-edges (see below).</S>
    <S sid="157" ssid="19">The second composition operation involving dtrees is called sister-adjunction.</S>
    <S sid="158" ssid="20">When a d-tree a is sister-adjoined at a node ri in a d-tree 13 the composed d-tree 7 results from the addition to fl of a as a new leftmost or rightmost sub-d-tree below I).</S>
    <S sid="159" ssid="21">Note that sister-adjunction involves the addition of exactly one new immediate domination edge and that several sister-adjunctions can occur at the same node.</S>
    <S sid="160" ssid="22">Sister-adjoining constraints specify where d-trees can be sister-adjoined and whether they will be right- or left-sister-adjoined (see below).</S>
    <S sid="161" ssid="23">A DTG is a four tuple G = (ITN , VT S, D) where VN and VT are the usual nonterminal and terminal alphabets, S E VN is a distinguished nonterminal and D is a finite set of elementary d-trees.</S>
    <S sid="162" ssid="24">A DTG is said to be lexicalized if each d-tree in the grammar has at least one terminal node.</S>
    <S sid="163" ssid="25">The elementary d-trees of a grammar G have two additional annotations: subsertion-insertion constraints and sister-adjoining constraints.</S>
    <S sid="164" ssid="26">These will be described below, but first we define simultaneously DTG derivations and subsertion-adjoining trees (SAtrees), which are partial derivation structures that can be interpreted as representing dependency information, the importance of which was stressed in the introduction'.</S>
    <S sid="165" ssid="27">Consider a DTG G = (VN, VT S D).</S>
    <S sid="166" ssid="28">In defining SA-trees, we assume some naming convention for the elementary d-trees in D and some consistent ordering on the components and nodes of elementary d-trees in D. For each i, we define the set of d-trees Ti(G) whose derivations are captured by SA-trees of height i or less.</S>
    <S sid="167" ssid="29">Let To(G) be the set D of elementary d-trees of G. Mark all of the components of each d-tree in To(G) as being substitutable6.</S>
    <S sid="168" ssid="30">Only components marked as substitutable can be substituted in a subsertion operation.</S>
    <S sid="169" ssid="31">The SA-tree for a E T0(G) consists of a single node labelled by the elementary d-tree name for a.</S>
    <S sid="170" ssid="32">For i&gt; 0 let Ti(G) be the union of the set T1_1(G) with the set of all d-trees 7 that can be produced as follows.</S>
    <S sid="171" ssid="33">Let a E D and let 7 be the result of subserting or sister-adjoining the d-trees 7',.</S>
    <S sid="172" ssid="34">&#8226; 7k into a where 71, ,-y, are all in T1... ,(G), with the subsertions taking place at different substitution nodes in a as the footnote.</S>
    <S sid="173" ssid="35">Only substitutable components of -y1,...,-yk can be substituted in these subsertions.</S>
    <S sid="174" ssid="36">Only the new components of 7 that came from a are marked as substitutable in 7.</S>
    <S sid="175" ssid="37">Let r1, , kbe the SA-trees for 71, , 7k, respectively.</S>
    <S sid="176" ssid="38">The SA-tree 7 for 7 has root labelled by the name for a and k subtrees 71, , 7k.</S>
    <S sid="177" ssid="39">The edge from the root of r to the root of the subtree 7i is labelled by i (1 &lt; i &lt; k) defined as follows.</S>
    <S sid="178" ssid="40">Suppose that 7i was subserted into a and the root of ri is labelled by the name of some a' E D. Only components of a' will have been marked as substitutable in 7.</S>
    <S sid="179" ssid="41">Thus, in this subsertion some component ai(j) will have been substituted at a node in a with address n. In this case, the label 1 is the pair (j, n).</S>
    <S sid="180" ssid="42">Alternatively, 7i will have 'Due to space limitations, in the following definitions we are forced to be somewhat imprecise when we identify a node in a derived d-tree with the node in the elementary d-trees (elementary nodes) from which it was derived.</S>
    <S sid="181" ssid="43">This is often done in TAG literature, and hopefully it will be clear what is intended.</S>
    <S sid="182" ssid="44">'We will discuss the notion of substitutability further in the next section.</S>
    <S sid="183" ssid="45">It is used to ensure the SA-tree is a tree.</S>
    <S sid="184" ssid="46">That is, an elementary structure cannot be subserted into more than one structure since this would be counter to our motivations for using subsertion for complementation. been d-sister-adjoined at some node with address n in a, in which case l will be the pair (d, n) where d E { left, right }.</S>
    <S sid="185" ssid="47">The tree set T(G) generated by G is defined as the set of trees 7 such that: 7' E Ti(G) for some i &gt; 0; 7' is rooted with the nonterminal S; the frontier of 7' is a string in Vit ; and 7 results from the removal of all d-edges from 7'.</S>
    <S sid="186" ssid="48">A d-edge is removed by merging the nodes at either end of the edge as long as they are labelled by the same symbol.</S>
    <S sid="187" ssid="49">The string language L(G) associated with G is the set of terminal strings appearing on the frontier of trees in T(G).</S>
    <S sid="188" ssid="50">We have given a reasonably precise definition of SA-trees since they play such an important role in the motivation for this work.</S>
    <S sid="189" ssid="51">We now describe informally a structure that can be used to encode a DTG derivation.</S>
    <S sid="190" ssid="52">A derivation graph for 7 E T(G) results from the addition of insertion edges to a SA-tree r for 7.</S>
    <S sid="191" ssid="53">The location in -y of an inserted elementary component a(i) can be unambiguously determined by identifying the source of the node (say the node with address n in the elementary d-tree a') with which the root of this occurrence of a(i) is merged with when d-edges are removed.</S>
    <S sid="192" ssid="54">The insertion edge will relate the two (not necessarily distinct) nodes corresponding to appropriate occurrences of a and a' and will be labelled by the pair (i, n).</S>
    <S sid="193" ssid="55">Each d-edge in elementary d-trees has an associated subsertion-insertion constraint (SIC).</S>
    <S sid="194" ssid="56">A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs).</S>
    <S sid="195" ssid="57">An ENA n specifies some elementary d-tree a E D, a component of a and the address of a node within that component of a.</S>
    <S sid="196" ssid="58">If a ENA q is in the SIC associated with a d-edge between qi and q2 in an elementary d-tree a then n cannot appear properly within the path that appears from i to 712 in the derived tree 7 E T(G).</S>
    <S sid="197" ssid="59">Each node of elementary d-trees has an associated sister-adjunction constraint (SAC).</S>
    <S sid="198" ssid="60">A SAC is a finite set of pairs, each pair identifying a direction (left or right) and an elementary d-tree.</S>
    <S sid="199" ssid="61">A SAC gives a complete specification of what can be sisteradjoined at a node.</S>
    <S sid="200" ssid="62">If a node ti is associated with a SAC containing a pair (d, a) then the d-tree a can be d-sister-adjoined at q.</S>
    <S sid="201" ssid="63">By definition of sisteradjunction, all substitution nodes and all nodes at the top of d-edges can be assumed to have SACs that are the empty-set.</S>
    <S sid="202" ssid="64">This prevents sister-adjunction at these nodes.</S>
    <S sid="203" ssid="65">In this section we have defined &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; DTG.</S>
    <S sid="204" ssid="66">In a more refined version of the formalism we would associate (a single) finite-valued feature structure with each node'.</S>
    <S sid="205" ssid="67">It is a matter of further research to determine to what extent SICs and SACs can be stated globally for a grammar, rather than being attached to d-edges/nodess.</S>
    <S sid="206" ssid="68">See the next section for a brief discussion of linguistic principles from which a grammar's SICs could be derived.</S>
  </SECTION>
  <SECTION title="3 Linguistic Examples" number="3">
    <S sid="207" ssid="1">In this section, we show how an account for the data introduced in Section 1 can be given with DTG.</S>
    <S sid="208" ssid="2">In Figure 4, we give a DTG that generates sentence (1).</S>
    <S sid="209" ssid="3">Every d-tree is a projection from a lexical anchor.</S>
    <S sid="210" ssid="4">The label of the maximal projection is, we assume, determined by the morphology of the anchor.</S>
    <S sid="211" ssid="5">For example, if the anchor is a finite verb, it will project to S, indicating that an overt syntactic (&amp;quot;surface&amp;quot;) subject is required for agreement with it (and perhaps case-assignment).</S>
    <S sid="212" ssid="6">Furthermore, a finite verb may optionally also project to S' (as in the d-tree shown for claims), indicating that a whmoved or topicalized element is required.</S>
    <S sid="213" ssid="7">The finite verb seems also projects to S, even though it does not itself provide a functional subject.</S>
    <S sid="214" ssid="8">In the case of the to adore tree, the situation is the inverse: the functional subject requires a finite verb to agree with, which is signaled by the fact that its component's root and frontier nodes are labelled S and VP, respectively, but the verb itself is not finite and therefore only projects to VP[-fin].</S>
    <S sid="215" ssid="9">Therefore, the subject will have to raise out of its clause for agreement and case assignment.</S>
    <S sid="216" ssid="10">The direct object of to adore has wh-moved out of the projection of the verb (we include a trace for the sake of clarity).</S>
    <S sid="217" ssid="11">We add SICs to ensure that the projections are respected by components of other d-trees that may be inserted during a derivation.</S>
    <S sid="218" ssid="12">A SIC is associated with the d-edge between VP and S node in the seems d-tree to ensure that no node labelled S' can be inserted within it &#8211; i.e., it can not be filled by with a wh-moved element.</S>
    <S sid="219" ssid="13">In contrast, since both the subject and the object of to adore have been moved out of the projection of the verb, the path to these arguments do not carry any SIC at all'.</S>
    <S sid="220" ssid="14">We now discuss a possible derivation.</S>
    <S sid="221" ssid="15">We start out with the most deeply embedded clause, the adores clause.</S>
    <S sid="222" ssid="16">Before subserting its nominal arguments, we sister-adjoin the two adjectival trees to the tree for hotdogs.</S>
    <S sid="223" ssid="17">This is handled by a SAC associated with the N' node that allows all trees rooted in AdjP to be left sister-adjoined.</S>
    <S sid="224" ssid="18">We then subsert this structure and the subject into the to adore d-tree.</S>
    <S sid="225" ssid="19">We subsert the resulting structure into the seems clause by substituting its maximal projection node, labelled VP[fin: 1, at the VP[fin: -] frontier node of seems, and by inserting the subject into the d-edge of the seems tree.</S>
    <S sid="226" ssid="20">Now, only the S node of the seems tree (which is its maximal projection) is substitutable.</S>
    <S sid="227" ssid="21">Finally, we subsert this derived struc'We enforce island effects for wh-movement by using a [&#177;extract] feature on substitution nodes.</S>
    <S sid="228" ssid="22">This corresponds roughly to the analysis in TAG, where islandhood is (to a large extent) enforced by designating a particular node as the foot node (Kroch &amp; Joshi, 1986). ture into the claims d-tree by substituting the S node of seems at che S complement node of claims, and by inserting the object of adores (which has not yet been used in the derivation) in the d-edge of the claims d-tree above its S node.</S>
    <S sid="229" ssid="23">The derived tree is shown in Figure 5.</S>
    <S sid="230" ssid="24">The SA-tree for this derivation corresponds to the dependency tree given previously in Figure 2.</S>
    <S sid="231" ssid="25">Note that this is the only possible derivation involving these three d-trees, modulo order of operations.</S>
    <S sid="232" ssid="26">To see this, consider the following putative alternate derivation.</S>
    <S sid="233" ssid="27">We first subsert the to adore d-tree into the seems tree as above, by substituting the anchor component at the substitution node of seems.</S>
    <S sid="234" ssid="28">We insert the subject component of to adore above the anchor component of seems.</S>
    <S sid="235" ssid="29">We then subsert this derived structure into the claims tree by substituting the root of the subject component of to adore at the S node of claims and by inserting the S node of the seems d-tree as well as the object component of the to adore d-tree in the SYS d-edge of the claims d-tree.</S>
    <S sid="236" ssid="30">This last operation is shown in Figure 6.</S>
    <S sid="237" ssid="31">The resulting phrase structure tree would be the same as in the previously discussed derivation, but the derivation structure is linguistically meaningless, since to adore would have been subserted into both seems and claims.</S>
    <S sid="238" ssid="32">However, this derivation is ruled out by the restriction that only substitutable components can be substituted: the subject component of the adore d-tree is not substitutable after subsertion into the seems d-tree, and therefore it cannot be substituted into the claims d-tree.</S>
    <S sid="239" ssid="33">In the above discussion, substitutability played a central role in ruling out the derivation.</S>
    <S sid="240" ssid="34">We observe in passing that the SIC associated to the d-edge in the seems d-tree also rules out this derivation.</S>
    <S sid="241" ssid="35">The derivation requires that the S node of seems be inserted into the S'/S d-edge of claims.</S>
    <S sid="242" ssid="36">However, we would have to stretch the edge over two components which are both ruled out by the SIC, since they violate the projection from seems to its S node.</S>
    <S sid="243" ssid="37">Thus, the derivation is excluded by the independently motivated SICs, which enforce the notion of projection.</S>
    <S sid="244" ssid="38">This raises the possibility that, in grammars that express certain linguistic principles, substitutability is not needed for ruling out derivations of this nature.</S>
    <S sid="245" ssid="39">We intend to examine this issue in future work. for sentence (2b).</S>
    <S sid="246" ssid="40">We use the node label VP throughout and use features such as top (for topic) to differentiate different levels of projection.</S>
    <S sid="247" ssid="41">Observe that in both trees an argument has been fronted.</S>
    <S sid="248" ssid="42">Again, we will use the SICs to enforce the projection from a lexical anchor to its maximal projection.</S>
    <S sid="249" ssid="43">Since the direct object of kor has wh-moved out of its clause, the d-edge connecting it to the maximal projection of its verb has no SIC.</S>
    <S sid="250" ssid="44">The d-edge connecting the maximal projection of baasaan to the Aux component, however, has a SIC that allows only VP[wh: +, top: -] nodes to be inserted.</S>
    <S sid="251" ssid="45">The derivation proceeds as follows.</S>
    <S sid="252" ssid="46">We first subsert the embedded clause tree into the matrix clause tree.</S>
    <S sid="253" ssid="47">After that, we subsert the nominal arguments and function words.</S>
    <S sid="254" ssid="48">The derived structure is shown in Figure 8.</S>
    <S sid="255" ssid="49">The associated SA-tree is the desired, semantically motivated, dependency structure: the embedded clause depends on the matrix clause.</S>
    <S sid="256" ssid="50">In this section, we have discussed examples where the elementary objects have been obtained by projecting from lexical items.</S>
    <S sid="257" ssid="51">In these cases, we overcome both the problems with TAG considered in Section 1.</S>
    <S sid="258" ssid="52">The SICs considered here enforce the same notion of projection that was used in obtaining the elementary structures.</S>
    <S sid="259" ssid="53">This method of arriving at SICs not only generalizes for the English and Kashmiri examples but also appears to apply to the case of long-distance scrambling and topicalization in German.</S>

    <S sid="260" ssid="1">It is straightforward to adapt the polynomial-time CKY-style recognition algorithm for a lexicalized UVG-DL of ftarnhow (199419) for DTG.</S>
    <S sid="261" ssid="2">The entries in this array recording derivations of substrings of input contain a set of elementary nodes along with a multi-set of components that must be inserted above during bottom-up recognition.</S>
    <S sid="262" ssid="3">These components are added or removed at substitution and insertion.</S>
    <S sid="263" ssid="4">The algorithm simulates traversal of a derived tree; checking for SICs and SACS can be done easily.</S>
    <S sid="264" ssid="5">Because of lexicalization, the size of these multi-sets is polynomially bounded, from which the polynomial time and space complexity of the algorithm follows.</S>
