Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Statistical Machine Translation
Recent research presents conflicting evidence on whether word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems can help to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (MT) systems.
In this paper, we successfully integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based MT system, Hiero.
We show for the first time that integrating a WSD system improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical MT system on an actual translation task.
Furthermore, the improvement is statistically significant.
We train a discriminative model for WSD using local but also across-sentence unigram collocations of words in order to refine phrase pair selection dynamically by incorporating scores from the WSD classifier.
We use an SVM based classifier for disambiguating word senses which are directly incorporated in the decoder through additional features that are part of the log-linear combination of models.
