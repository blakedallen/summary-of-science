Automatically Labeling Semantic Classes
Systems that automatically discover semantic classes have emerged in part to address the limitations of broad-coverage lexical resources such as WordNet and Cyc.
The current state of the art discovers many semantic classes but fails to label their concepts.
We propose an algorithm labeling semantic classes and for leveraging them to extract is-a relationships using a top-down approach.
The relationships automatically learned in our system include appositions, nominal subjects, such as relationships, and like relationships.
Our syntactical co-occurrence approach has worst-case time complexity O (n2k), where n is the number of words in the corpus and k is the feature space.
Given a collection of news articles that is both cleaner and smaller than Web document collections, a syntactic parser is applied to document sentences in order to identify and exploit syntactic dependencies for the purpose of selecting candidate class labels.
