Unsupervised Personal Name Disambiguation
This paper presents a set of algorithms for distinguishing personal names with multiple real referents in text, based on little or no supervision.
The approach utilizes an unsupervised clustering technique over a rich feature space of biographic facts, which are automatically extracted via a language-independent bootstrapping process.
The induced clustering of named entities are then partitioned and linked to their real referents via the automatically extracted biographic data.
Performance is evaluated based on both a test set of hand-labeled multi-referent personal names and via automatically generated pseudonames.
We extract biographic facts such as date or place of birth, occupation, relatives among others to help resolve ambiguous names of people.
