Catching The Drift: Probabilistic Content Models With Applications To Generation And Summarization
We consider the problem of modeling the content structure of texts within a specific domain, in terms of the topics the texts address and the order in which these topics appear.
We first present an effective knowledge-lean method for learning content models from unannotated documents, utilizing a novel adaptation of algorithms for Hidden Markov Models.
We then apply our method to two complementary tasks: information ordering and extractive summarization.
Our experiments show that incorporating content models in these applications yields substantial improvement over previously-proposed methods.
We proposed a domain-dependent HMM model to capture topic shift in a text, where topics are represented by hidden states and sentences are observations.
