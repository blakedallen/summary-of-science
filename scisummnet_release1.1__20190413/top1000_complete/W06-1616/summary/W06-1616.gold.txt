Incremental Integer Linear Programming For Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
Integer Linear Programming has recently been used for decoding in a number of probabilistic models in order to enforce global constraints.
However, in certain applications, such as non-projective dependency parsing and machine translation, the complete formulation of the decoding problem as an integer linear program renders solving intractable.
We present an approach which solves the problem incrementally, thus we avoid creating intractable integer linear programs.
This approach is applied to Dutch dependency parsing and we show how the addition of linguistically motivated constraints can yield a significant improvement over state-of-the-art.
For dependency parsing, we study a method using integer linear programming which can incorporate global linguistic constraints.
Our work in dependency parsing demonstrate that it is possible to use ILP to perform efficient inference for very large programs when used in an incremental manner.
We show that even exponentially large decoding problems may be solved efficiently using ILP solvers if a Cutting-Plane Algorithm (Dantzig et al, 1954) is used.
We tackle the MAP problem for dependency parsing by an incremental approach that starts with a relaxation of the problem, solves it, and adds additional constraints only if they are violated.
