Disambiguating Noun Groupings With Respect To Wordnet Senses
Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available, as thesauri appear on-line, and as distributional word clustering techniques improve.
However, for many tasks, one is interested in relationships among word senses, not words.
This paper presents a method for automatic sense disambiguafton of nouns appearing within sets of related nouns -- the kind of data one finds in on-line thesauri, or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms.
Disambiguation is performed with respect to WordNet senses, which are fairly fine-gained; however, the method also permits the assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels.
The method is illustrated primarily by example, though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented.
In this work, the assessment of semantic similarity using a dictionary database as knowledge source is recognized as providing significant cues for word clustering.
We define the semantic similarity between two words as the entropy value of the most informative concept subsuming the two words in a hierarchically structured thesaurus.
We attempt to combine paradigmatic and syntagmatic similarity strategies.
