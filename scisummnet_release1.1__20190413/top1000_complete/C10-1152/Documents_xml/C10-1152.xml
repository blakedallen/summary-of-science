			<S sid="5" ssid="5">Sentence simplification transforms long and dif ficult sentences into shorter and more readable ones.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">This helps humans read texts more easilyand faster.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">Reading assistance is thus an important application of sentence simplification, espe cially for people with reading disabilities (Carrollet al, 1999; Inui et al, 2003), low-literacy read ers (Watanabe et al, 2009), or non-native speakers (Siddharthan, 2002).Not only human readers but also NLP applications can benefit from sentence simplification.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">The original motivation for sentence simplification is using it as a preprocessor to facili tate parsing or translation tasks (Chandrasekar et al., 1996).</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">Complex sentences are considered as stumbling blocks for such systems.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">More recently,sentence simplification has also been shown help ful for summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000), ? This work has been supported by the Emmy Noether Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG) underthe grant No.</S>

			<S sid="12" ssid="12">I/82806.sentence fusion (Filippova and Strube, 2008b), se mantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008), question generation (Heilman and Smith, 2009), paraphrase generation (Zhao et al, 2009) and biomedical information extraction (Jonnalagadda and Gonzalez, 2009).At sentence level, reading difficulty stems either from lexical or syntactic complexity.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">Sen tence simplification can therefore be classifiedinto two types: lexical simplification and syntac tic simplification (Carroll et al, 1999).</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">These two types of simplification can be further implemented by a set of simplification operations.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">Splitting, dropping, reordering, and substitution are widely accepted as important simplification operations.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">The splitting operation splits a long sentence intoseveral shorter sentences to decrease the complex ity of the long sentence.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">The dropping operation further removes unimportant parts of a sentence to make it more concise.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">The reordering operationinterchanges the order of the split sentences (Sid dharthan, 2006) or parts in a sentence (Watanabeet al, 2009).</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">Finally, the substitution operation re places difficult phrases or words with their simpler synonyms.In most cases, different simplification operations happen simultaneously.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">It is therefore nec essary to consider the simplification process as a combination of different operations and treatthem as a whole.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">However, most of the existing models only consider one of these operations.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">Siddharthan (2006) and Petersen and Ostendorf (2007) focus on sentence splitting, while sen tence compression systems (Filippova and Strube, 2008a) mainly use the dropping operation.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">As faras lexical simplification is concerned, word substitution is usually done by selecting simpler syn onyms from Wordnet based on word frequency (Carroll et al, 1999).In this paper, we propose a sentence simplifica tion model by tree transformation which is based 1353 on techniques from statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Yamada andKnight, 2002; Graehl et al, 2008).</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">Our model in tegrally covers splitting, dropping, reordering and phrase/word substitution.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">The parameters of ourmodel can be efficiently learned from complex simple parallel datasets.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="26">The transformation froma complex sentence to a simple sentence is con ducted by applying a sequence of simplification operations.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="27">An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to iteratively train our model.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="28">We also propose a method based on monolingualword mapping which speeds up the training pro cess significantly.</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="29">Finally, a decoder is designed to generate the simplified sentences using a greedy strategy and integrates language models.In order to train our model, we further com pile a large-scale complex-simple parallel dataset(PWKP) from Simple English Wikipedia1 and En glish Wikipedia2, as such datasets are rare.We organize the remainder of the paper as follows: Section 2 describes the PWKP dataset.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="30">Sec tion 3 presents our TSM model.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="31">Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to training and decoding, respectively.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="32">Section 6 details the evaluation.</S>

	<SECTION title="Evaluation. " number="6">
			<S sid="231" ssid="1">Our evaluation dataset consists of 100 complex sentences and 131 parallel simple sentences from PWKP.</S>
			<S sid="232" ssid="2">They have not been used for training.Four baseline systems are compared in our eval uation.</S>
			<S sid="233" ssid="3">The first is Moses which is a state of the art SMT system widely used as a baseline in MT community.</S>
			<S sid="234" ssid="4">Obviously, the purpose of Mosesis cross-lingual translation rather than monolin 1358 gual simplification.</S>
			<S sid="235" ssid="5">The goal of our comparison is therefore to assess how well a standard SMT system may perform simplification when fed with a proper training dataset.</S>
			<S sid="236" ssid="6">We train Moses with the same part of PWKP as our model.</S>
			<S sid="237" ssid="7">The secondbaseline system is a sentence compression sys tem (Filippova and Strube, 2008a) whose demo system is available online.8 As the compressionsystem can only perform dropping, we further ex tend it to our third and fourth baseline systems, in order to make a reasonable comparison.</S>
			<S sid="238" ssid="8">In our third baseline system, we substitute the words in the output of the compression system with their simpler synonyms.</S>
			<S sid="239" ssid="9">This is done by looking up the synonyms in Wordnet and selecting the mostfrequent synonym for replacement.</S>
			<S sid="240" ssid="10">The word fre quency is counted using the articles from Simple Wikipedia.</S>
			<S sid="241" ssid="11">The fourth system performs sentence splitting on the output of the third system.</S>
			<S sid="242" ssid="12">This is simply done by splitting the sentences at ?and?,?or?, ?but?, ?which?, ?who?</S>
			<S sid="243" ssid="13">and ?that?, and dis carding the border words.</S>
			<S sid="244" ssid="14">In total, there are 5systems in our evaluation: Moses, the MT system; C, the compression system; CS, the compression+substitution system; CSS, the compres sion+substitution+split system; TSM, our model.We also provide evaluation measures for the sen tences in the evaluation dataset: CW: complexsentences from Normal Wikipedia and SW: par allel simple sentences from Simple Wikipedia.</S>
			<S sid="245" ssid="15">6.1 Basic Statistics and Examples.</S>
			<S sid="246" ssid="16">The first three columns in Tab.</S>
			<S sid="247" ssid="17">9 present the ba sic statistics for the evaluation sentences and theoutput of the five systems.</S>
			<S sid="248" ssid="18">tokenLen is the aver age length of tokens which may roughly reflect the lexical difficulty.</S>
			<S sid="249" ssid="19">TSM achieves an average token length which is the same as the Simple Wikipedia (SW).</S>
			<S sid="250" ssid="20">senLen is the average number of tokens inone sentence, which may roughly reflect the syn tactic complexity.</S>
			<S sid="251" ssid="21">Both TSM and CSS produce shorter sentences than SW.</S>
			<S sid="252" ssid="22">Moses is very close to CW.</S>
			<S sid="253" ssid="23">#sen gives the number of sentences.</S>
			<S sid="254" ssid="24">Moses, C and CS cannot split sentences and thus produce about the same number of sentences as available in CW.</S>
			<S sid="255" ssid="25">Here are two example results obtained with our TSM system.Example 1.</S>
			<S sid="256" ssid="26">CW: ?Genetic engineering has ex panded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops.?</S>
			<S sid="257" ssid="27">SW: 8http://212.126.215.106/compression/?New plants were created with genetic engineer ing.?</S>
			<S sid="258" ssid="28">TSM: ?Engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in making germlines for new crops.?</S>
			<S sid="259" ssid="29">Example 2.</S>
			<S sid="260" ssid="30">CW: ?An umbrella term is a word thatprovides a superset or grouping of related con cepts, also called a hypernym.?</S>
			<S sid="261" ssid="31">SW: ?An umbrellaterm is a word that provides a superset or group ing of related concepts.?</S>
			<S sid="262" ssid="32">TSM: ?An umbrella term is a word.</S>
			<S sid="263" ssid="33">A word provides a superset of related concepts, called a hypernym.?In the first example, both substitution and dropping happen.</S>
			<S sid="264" ssid="34">TSM replaces ?utilize?</S>
			<S sid="265" ssid="35">and ?cre ating?</S>
			<S sid="266" ssid="36">with ?use?</S>
			<S sid="267" ssid="37">and ?making?.</S>
			<S sid="268" ssid="38">?Genetic?</S>
			<S sid="269" ssid="39">isdropped.</S>
			<S sid="270" ssid="40">In the second example, the complex sen tence is split and ?also?</S>
			<S sid="271" ssid="41">is dropped.</S>
			<S sid="272" ssid="42">6.2 Translation Assessment.</S>
			<S sid="273" ssid="43">In this part of the evaluation, we use traditional measures used for evaluating MT systems.</S>
			<S sid="274" ssid="44">Tab.</S>
			<S sid="275" ssid="45">9 shows the BLEU and NIST scores.</S>
			<S sid="276" ssid="46">We use ?mteval-v11b.pl?9 as the evaluation tool.</S>
			<S sid="277" ssid="47">CWand SW are used respectively as source and ref erence sentences.</S>
			<S sid="278" ssid="48">TSM obtains a very high BLEU score (0.38) but not as high as Moses (0.55).</S>
			<S sid="279" ssid="49">However, the original complex sentences (CW) from Normal Wikipedia get a rather high BLEU (0.50), when compared to the simple sentences.</S>
			<S sid="280" ssid="50">We also find that most of the sentences generated by Moses are exactly the same as those in CW:this shows that Moses only performs few modi fications to the original complex sentences.</S>
			<S sid="281" ssid="51">This is confirmed by MT evaluation measures: if we set CW as both source and reference, the BLEU score obtained by Moses is 0.78.</S>
			<S sid="282" ssid="52">TSM gets 0.55 in the same setting which is significantly smaller than Moses and demonstrates that TSM is able to generate simplifications with a greater amount of variation from the original sentence.</S>
			<S sid="283" ssid="53">As shown inthe ?#Same?</S>
			<S sid="284" ssid="54">column of Tab.</S>
			<S sid="285" ssid="55">9, 25 sentences generated by Moses are exactly identical to the com plex sentences, while the number for TSM is 2 which is closer to SW.</S>
			<S sid="286" ssid="56">It is however not clear how well BLEU and NIST discriminate simplification systems.</S>
			<S sid="287" ssid="57">As discussed in Jurafsky and Martin (2008), ?BLEU does poorly at comparing systems with radically different architectures and is most appropriate when evaluating incremental changes with similar architectures.?</S>
			<S sid="288" ssid="58">In our case, TSM andCSS can be considered as having similar architec tures as both of them can do splitting, dropping 9http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 1359 TokLen SenLen #Sen BLEU NIST #Same Flesch Lix(Grade) OOV% PPL CW 4.95 27.81 100 0.50 6.89 100 49.1 53.0 (10) 52.9 384 SW 4.76 17.86 131 1.00 10.98 3 60.4 (PE) 44.1 (8) 50.7 179 Moses 4.81 26.08 100 0.55 7.47 25 54.8 48.1 (9) 52.0 363 C 4.98 18.02 103 0.28 5.37 1 56.2 45.9 (8) 51.7 481 CS 4.90 18.11 103 0.19 4.51 0 59.1 45.1 (8) 49.5 616 CSS 4.98 10.20 182 0.18 4.42 0 65.5 (PE) 38.3 (6) 53.4 581 TSM 4.76 13.57 180 0.38 6.21 2 67.4 (PE) 36.7 (5) 50.8 353 Table 9: Evaluation and substitution.</S>
			<S sid="289" ssid="59">But Moses mostly cannot split and drop.</S>
			<S sid="290" ssid="60">We may conclude that TSM and Moses have different architectures and BLEU or NIST isnot suitable for comparing them.</S>
			<S sid="291" ssid="61">Here is an exam ple to illustrate this: (CW): ?Almost as soon as heleaves, Annius and the guard Publius arrive to es cort Vitellia to Titus, who has now chosen her as his empress.?</S>
			<S sid="292" ssid="62">(SW): ?Almost as soon as he leaves,Annius and the guard Publius arrive to take Vitellia to Titus, who has now chosen her as his empress.?</S>
			<S sid="293" ssid="63">(Moses): The same as (SW).</S>
			<S sid="294" ssid="64">(TSM): ?An nius and the guard Publius arrive to take Vitellia to Titus.</S>
			<S sid="295" ssid="65">Titus has now chosen her as his empress.?In this example, Moses generates an exactly iden tical sentence to SW, thus the BLUE and NIST scores of Moses is the highest.</S>
			<S sid="296" ssid="66">TSM simplifies the complex sentence by dropping, splitting and substitution, which results in two sentences that are quite different from the SW sentence and thus gets lower BLUE and NIST scores.</S>
			<S sid="297" ssid="67">Nevertheless, the sentences generated by TSM seem better than Moses in terms of simplification.</S>
			<S sid="298" ssid="68">6.3 Readability Assessment.</S>
			<S sid="299" ssid="69">Intuitively, readability scores should be suitable metrics for simplification systems.</S>
			<S sid="300" ssid="70">We use the Linux ?style?</S>
			<S sid="301" ssid="71">command to calculate the Fleschand Lix readability scores.</S>
			<S sid="302" ssid="72">The results are pre sented in Tab.</S>

			<S sid="306" ssid="76">and the ?Grade?</S>
			<S sid="307" ssid="77">in Lix repre sents the school year.</S>
			<S sid="308" ssid="78">TSM achieves significantly better scores than Moses which has the best BLEUscore.</S>
			<S sid="309" ssid="79">This implies that good monolingual trans lation is not necessarily good simplification.</S>
			<S sid="310" ssid="80">OOVis the percentage of words that are not in the Ba sic English BE850 list.10 TSM is ranked as the second best system for this criterion.The perplexity (PPL) is a score of text probability measured by a language model and normal ized by the number of words in the text (Equ.</S>

			<S sid="312" ssid="82">10http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Wikipedia:Basic_English_alphabetical_ wordlistPPL can be used to measure how tight the language model fits the text.</S>
			<S sid="313" ssid="83">Language models constitute an important feature for assessing readabil ity (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).</S>
			<S sid="314" ssid="84">We train a trigram LM using the simple sentences in PWKP and calculate the PPL with SRILM.</S>
			<S sid="315" ssid="85">TSM gets the best PPL score.</S>
			<S sid="316" ssid="86">From this table, we can conclude that TSM achieves better overall readability than the baseline systems.</S>
			<S sid="317" ssid="87">PPL(text) = P (w1w2...wN )?</S>
			<S sid="318" ssid="88">1 N (6)There are still some important issues to be con sidered in future.</S>
			<S sid="319" ssid="89">Based on our observations, the current model performs well for word substitution and segmentation.</S>
			<S sid="320" ssid="90">But the completion of the new sentences is still problematic.</S>
			<S sid="321" ssid="91">For example, we copy the dependent NP to the new sentences.</S>
			<S sid="322" ssid="92">This may break the coherence between sentences.</S>
			<S sid="323" ssid="93">Abetter solution would be to use a pronoun to replace the NP.</S>
			<S sid="324" ssid="94">Sometimes, excessive droppings oc cur, e.g., ?older?</S>
			<S sid="325" ssid="95">and ?twin?</S>
			<S sid="326" ssid="96">are dropped in ?She has an older brother and a twin brother...?.</S>
			<S sid="327" ssid="97">This results in a problematic sentence: ?She has anbrother and a brother...?.</S>
			<S sid="328" ssid="98">There are also some er rors which stem from the dependency parser.</S>
			<S sid="329" ssid="99">InExample 2, ?An umbrella term?</S>
			<S sid="330" ssid="100">should be a dependency of ?called?.</S>
