A Statistical Approach To Anaphora Resolution
This paper presents an algorithm for identifying pronominal anaphora and two experiments based upon this algorithm.
We incorporate multiple anaphora resolution factors into a statistical framework -- specifically the distance between the pronoun and the proposed antecedent, gender/number/animaticity of the proposed antecedent, governing head information and noun phrase repetition.
We combine them into a single probability that enables us to identify the referent.
Our first experiment shows the relative contribution of each source of information and demonstrates a success rate of 82.9% for all sources combined.
The second experiment investigates a method for unsupervised learning of gender/number/animaticity information.
We present some experiments illustrating the accuracy of the method and note that with this information added, our pronoun resolution method achieves 84.2% accuracy.
We add annotation of the antecedents of definite pronouns to Treebank.
We implement a Hobbs distance feature, which encodes the rank assigned to a candidate antecedent for a pronoun by Hobbs's (1978) seminal syntax-based pronoun resolution algorithm.
We count the number of times a discourse entities has been mentioned in the discourse already.
Our probabilistic approach combines three factors (aside from the agreement filter): the result of the Hobbs algorithm, Mention Count dependent on the position of the sentence in the article, and the probability of the antecedent occurring in the local context of the pronoun.
We describe a supervised probabilistic pronoun resolution algorithm which is based on complete syntactic information.
