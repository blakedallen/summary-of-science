Generation of (transitively) redundant pairs, as the formation of co reference sets (co reference clustering) is done after pairwise classification? Thereby generation of skewed training sets which lead to classifiers biased towards negative classification? No means to enforce global constraints such as transitivity? Underspecification of antecedent candidates These problems can be remedied by an incremental entity-mention model, where candidate pairs are evaluated on the basis of the emerging coreferencesets",
