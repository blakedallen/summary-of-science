Machine Learning For Coreference Resolution: From Local Classification To Global Ranking
In this paper, we view coreference resolution as a problem of ranking candidate partitions generated by different coreference systems.
We propose a set of partition-based features to learn a ranking model for distinguishing good and bad partitions.
Our approach compares favorably to two state-of-the-art coreference systems when evaluated on three standard coreference data sets.
We emphasize the global optimization of ranking clusters obtained locally.
We cast coreference resolution as a classification task and solve it in two steps: (1) train a classifier to determine whether two mentions are co-referent or not, and (2) use a clustering algorithm to partition the mentions into clusters, based on the pairwise predictions.
Our method ranks base models according to their performance on separate tuning set, and then uses the highest-ranked base model for predicting on test documents.
Most learning based coreference systems can be defined by four elements: the learning algorithm used to train the coreference classifier, the method of creating training instances for the learner, the feature set used to represent a training or test instance, and the clustering algorithm used to coordinate the coreference classification decisions.
