			<S sid="8" ssid="8">A huge amount of social media including news,forums, product reviews and blogs contain nu merous sentiment-based sentences.</S>

			<S sid="10" ssid="10">Senti ment expressions may describe the mood of thewriter (happy/sad/bored/grateful/...)</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">or the opin ion of the writer towards some specific entity (X is great/I hate X, etc.).</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">Automated identification of diverse sentimenttypes can be beneficial for many NLP systems such as review summarization systems, dia logue systems and public media analysis systems.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">Sometimes it is directly requested by the user toobtain articles or sentences with a certain senti ment value (e.g Give me all positive reviews of product X/ Show me articles which explain why movie X is boring).</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">In some other cases obtaining sentiment value can greatly enhance information extraction tasks like review summarization.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">Whilethe majority of existing sentiment extraction sys tems focus on polarity identification (e.g., positive vs. negative reviews) or extraction of a handful of pre-specified mood labels, there are many useful and relatively unexplored sentiment types.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">Sentiment extraction systems usually require an extensive set of manually supplied sentiment words or a handcrafted sentiment-specific dataset.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">With the recent popularity of article tagging, some social media types like blogs allow users to add sentiment tags to articles.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">This allows to use blogsas a large user-labeled dataset for sentiment learning and identification.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">However, the set of sentiment tags in most blog platforms is somewhat re stricted.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">Moreover, the assigned tag applies to the whole blog post while a finer grained sentiment extraction is needed (McDonald et al, 2007).With the recent popularity of the Twitter micro blogging service, a huge amount of frequently 1WordNet 2.1 definitions.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">241self-standing short textual sentences (tweets) became openly available for the research community.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">Many of these tweets contain a wide vari ety of user-defined hashtags.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">Some of these tagsare sentiment tags which assign one or more senti ment values to a tweet.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">In this paper we propose away to utilize such tagged Twitter data for classi fication of a wide variety of sentiment types from text.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">We utilize 50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys assentiment labels which allow us to build a classifier for dozens of sentiment types for short tex tual sentences.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="26">In our study we use four different feature types (punctuation, words, n-grams and patterns) for sentiment classification and evaluate the contribution of each feature type for this task.We show that our framework successfully identi fies sentiment types of the untagged tweets.</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="27">We confirm the quality of our algorithm using human judges.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="28">We also explore the dependencies and overlap between different sentiment types represented by smileys and Twitter tags.</S>

			<S sid="32" ssid="1">Sentiment analysis tasks typically combine twodifferent tasks: (1) Identifying sentiment expres sions, and (2) determining the polarity (sometimes called valence) of the expressed sentiment.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="2">These tasks are closely related as the purpose of most works is to determine whether a sentence bears a positive or a negative (implicit or explicit) opinion about the target of the sentiment.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="3">Several works (Wiebe, 2000; Turney, 2002;Riloff, 2003; Whitelaw et al, 2005) use lexical re sources and decide whether a sentence expressesa sentiment by the presence of lexical items (sen timent words).</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="4">Others combine additional feature types for this decision (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al, 2005; Bloom et al, 2007; McDonald et al, 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008a; Melville et al, 2009).</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="5">It was suggested that sentiment words may havedifferent senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Wiebe and Mihal cea, 2006), thus word sense disambiguation can improve sentiment analysis systems (Akkaya et al., 2009).</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="6">All works mentioned above identifyevaluative sentiment expressions and their polar ity.</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="7">Another line of works aims at identifying abroader range of sentiment classes expressing various emotions such as happiness, sadness, boredom, fear, and gratitude, regardless (or in addi tion to) positive or negative evaluations.</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="8">Mihalcea and Liu (2006) derive lists of words and phrases with happiness factor from a corpus of blog posts, where each post is annotated by the blogger with a mood label.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="9">Balog et al (2006) use the mood annotation of blog posts coupled with news datain order to discover the events that drive the dom inant moods expressed in blogs.</S>
			<S sid="41" ssid="10">Mishne (2005) used an ontology of over 100 moods assigned to blog posts to classify blog texts according tomoods.</S>
			<S sid="42" ssid="11">While (Mishne, 2005) classifies a blog entry (post), (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006) assign a hap piness factor to specific words and expressions.</S>
			<S sid="43" ssid="12">Mishne used a much broader range of moods.</S>
			<S sid="44" ssid="13">Strapparava and Mihalcea (2008) classify blogposts and news headlines to six sentiment cate gories.While most of the works on sentiment analysis focus on full text, some works address senti ment analysis in the phrasal and sentence level, see (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wilson et al,2005; McDonald et al, 2007; Titov and McDon ald, 2008a; Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Wilson et al, 2009; Tsur et al, 2010) among others.</S>
			<S sid="45" ssid="14">Only a few studies analyze the sentiment and polarity of tweets targeted at major brands.</S>
			<S sid="46" ssid="15">Jansenet al (2009) used a commercial sentiment analyzer as well as a manually labeled corpus.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="16">Davi dov et al (2010) analyze the use of the #sarcasmhashtag and its contribution to automatic recognition of sarcastic tweets.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="17">To the best of our knowledge, there are no works employing Twitter hashtags to learn a wide range of emotions and the re lations between the different emotions.</S>

	<SECTION title="Sentiment classification framework. " number="3">
			<S sid="50" ssid="1">Below we propose a set of classification featuresand present the algorithm for sentiment classifica tion.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="2">3.1 Classification features.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="3">We utilize four basic feature types for sentimentclassification: single word features, n-gram fea tures, pattern features and punctuation features.For the classification, all feature types are com bined into a single feature vector.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="4">3.1.1 Word-based and n-gram-based features Each word appearing in a sentence serves as a binary feature with weight equal to the inverted count of this word in the Twitter corpus.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="5">We also took each consecutive word sequence containing2?5 words as a binary n-gram feature using a similar weighting strategy.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="6">Thus n-gram features al ways have a higher weight than features of their component words, and rare words have a higher weight than common words.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="7">Words or n-gramsappearing in less than 0.5% of the training set sen tences do not constitute a feature.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="8">ASCII smileys and other punctuation sequences containing two or more consecutive punctuation symbols were used as single-word features.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="9">Word features alsoinclude the substituted meta-words for URLs, ref erences and hashtags (see Subsection 4.1).</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="10">3.1.2 Pattern-based featuresOur main feature type is based on surface pat terns.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="11">For automated extraction of patterns, we followed the pattern definitions given in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="12">We classified words into high-frequency words (HFWs) and content words (CWs).</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="13">A word whose corpus frequency is more (less) than FH (FC) is considered to be a HFW(CW).We estimate word frequency from the train ing set rather than from an external corpus.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="14">Unlike (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we consider allsingle punctuation characters or consecutive se quences of punctuation characters as HFWs.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="15">We also consider URL, REF, and HASHTAG tags as HFWs for pattern extraction.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="16">We define a pattern as an ordered sequence of high frequency words and slots for content words.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="17">Following (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008), the FH and FC thresholds were set to 1000 words per million (upper bound for FC) and 100 words per million (lower bound for FH )2.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="18">The patterns allow 2?6 HFWs and 1?5 slots forCWs.</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="19">To avoid collection of patterns which capture only a part of a meaningful multiword ex pression, we require patterns to start and to end with a HFW.</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="20">Thus a minimal pattern is of the form [HFW] [CW slot] [HFW].</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="21">For each sentenceit is possible to generate dozens of different pat terns that may overlap.</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="22">As with words and n-gram features, we do not treat as features any patterns which appear in less than 0.5% of the training set sentences.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="23">Since each feature vector is based on a singlesentence (tweet), we would like to allow approximate pattern matching for enhancement of learn ing flexibility.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="24">The value of a pattern feature is estimated according the one of the following four scenarios3: ? ????????????????????????</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="25">1 count(p) : Exact match ? all the pattern components appear in the sentence in correct order without any additional words.</S>
			<S sid="75" ssid="26">count(p) : Sparse match ? same as exact match but additional non-matching words can be inserted between pattern components.</S>
			<S sid="76" ssid="27">??n N?count(p) : Incomplete match ? only n &gt; 1 of N pattern components appear in the sentence, while some non-matching words can be inserted in-between.</S>
			<S sid="77" ssid="28">At least one of the appearing components should be a HFW.</S>
			<S sid="78" ssid="29">0 : No match ? nothing or only a single pattern component appears in the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="79" ssid="30">0 ? ?</S>
			<S sid="80" ssid="31">1 and 0 ? ?</S>
			<S sid="81" ssid="32">1 are parameters we use to assign reduced scores for imperfect matches.Since the patterns we use are relatively long, ex act matches are uncommon, and taking advantageof partial matches allows us to significantly re duce the sparsity of the feature vectors.</S>
			<S sid="82" ssid="33">We used ? = ? = 0.1 in all experiments.This pattern based framework was proven effi cient for sarcasm detection in (Tsur et al, 2010; 2Note that the FH and FC bounds allow overlap between some HFWs and CWs.</S>
			<S sid="83" ssid="34">See (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) for a short discussion.</S>
			<S sid="84" ssid="35">3As with word and n-gram features, the maximal featureweight of a pattern p is defined as the inverse count of a pat tern in the complete Twitter corpus.</S>
			<S sid="85" ssid="36">243 Davidov et al, 2010).</S>
			<S sid="86" ssid="37">3.1.3 Efficiency of feature selection Since we avoid selection of textual features which have a training set frequency below 0.5%, we perform feature selection incrementally, on each stage using the frequencies of the features obtained during the previous stages.</S>
			<S sid="87" ssid="38">Thus first we estimate the frequencies of single words in the training set, then we only consider creationof n-grams from single words with sufficient frequency, finally we only consider patterns composed from sufficiently frequent words and n grams.</S>
			<S sid="88" ssid="39">3.1.4 Punctuation-based features In addition to pattern-based features we used the following generic features: (1) Sentence length in words, (2) Number of ?!?</S>
			<S sid="89" ssid="40">characters in the sentence, (3) Number of ???</S>
			<S sid="90" ssid="41">characters in the sentence, (4) Number of quotes in the sentence, and (5) Number of capitalized/all capitals wordsin the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="42">All these features were normal ized by dividing them by the (maximal observed value times averaged maximal value of the other feature groups), thus the maximal weight of each of these features is equal to the averaged weight of a single pattern/word/n-gram feature.</S>
			<S sid="92" ssid="43">3.2 Classification algorithm.</S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="44">In order to assign a sentiment label to new exam ples in the test set we use a k-nearest neighbors(kNN)-like strategy.</S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="45">We construct a feature vec tor for each example in the training and the test set.</S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="46">We would like to assign a sentiment class toeach example in the test set.</S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="47">For each feature vec tor V in the test set, we compute the Euclidean distance to each of the matching vectors in the training set, where matching vectors are defined as ones which share at least one pattern/n-gram/word feature with v.Let ti, i = 1 . . .</S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="48">k be the k vectors with low est Euclidean distance to v4 with assigned labels Li, i = 1 . . .</S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="49">k. We calculate the mean distance d(ti, v) for this set of vectors and drop from the set up to five outliers for which the distance was more then twice the mean distance.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="50">The label assigned 4We used k = 10 for all experiments.</S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="51">to v is the label of the majority of the remaining vectors.</S>
			<S sid="101" ssid="52">If a similar number of remaining vectors have different labels, we assigned to the test vector the most frequent of these labels according to their frequency in the dataset.</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="53">If there are no matching vectors found for v, we assigned the default ?no sentiment?</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="54">label since there is significantly more non-sentiment sentences than sentiment sentences in Twitter.</S>

			<S sid="104" ssid="1">In our experiments we used an extensive Twit ter data collection as training and testing sets.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="2">In our training sets we utilize sentiment hashtags andsmileys as classification labels.</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="3">Below we de scribe this dataset in detail.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="4">4.1 Twitter dataset.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="5">We have used a Twitter dataset generously pro vided to us by Brendan O?Connor.</S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="6">This dataset includes over 475 million tweets comprising roughly 15% of all public, non-?low quality?</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="7">tweets created from May 2009 to Jan 2010.Tweets are short sentences limited to 140 UTF 8 characters.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="8">All non-English tweets and tweets which contain less than 5 proper English words5 were removed from the dataset.</S>
			<S sid="112" ssid="9">Apart of simple text, tweets may contain URLaddresses, references to other Twitter users (ap pear as @&lt;user&gt;) or a content tags (also called hashtags) assigned by the tweeter (#&lt;tag&gt;)which we use as labels for our supervised clas sification framework.</S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="10">Two examples of typical tweets are: ?#ipad #sucks and 6,510 people agree.</S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="11">See more on Ipad sucks page: http://j.mp/4OiYyg??, and ?Pay nomind to those who talk behind ur back, it sim ply means that u?re 2 steps ahead.</S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="12">#ihatequotes?.</S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="13">Note that in the first example the hashtagged words are a grammatical part of the sentence (itbecomes meaningless without them) while #ihate qoutes of the second example is a mere sentiment label and not part of the sentence.</S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="14">Also note that hashtags can be composed of multiple words (with no spaces).</S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="15">5Identification of proper English words was based on an available WN-based English dictionary 244 Category # of tags % agreement Strong sentiment 52 87 Likely sentiment 70 66 Context-dependent 110 61 Focused 45 75 No sentiment 3564 99 Table 1: Annotation results (2 judges) for the 3852 mostfrequent tweeter tags.</S>
			<S sid="119" ssid="16">The second column displays the av erage number of tags, and the last column shows % of tags annotated similarly by two judges.</S>
			<S sid="120" ssid="17">During preprocessing, we have replaced URL links, hashtags and references by URL/REF/TAG meta-words.</S>
			<S sid="121" ssid="18">This substitution obviously had some effect on the pattern recognition phase (see Section 3.1.2), however, our algorithm is robust enough to overcome this distortion.</S>
			<S sid="122" ssid="19">4.2 Hashtag-based sentiment labels.</S>
			<S sid="123" ssid="20">The Twitter dataset contains above 2.5 million dif ferent user-defined hashtags.</S>
			<S sid="124" ssid="21">Many tweets include more than a single tag and 3852 ?frequent?</S>
			<S sid="125" ssid="22">tags appear in more than 1000 different tweets.</S>
			<S sid="126" ssid="23">Two human judges manually annotated these frequenttags into five different categories: 1 ? strong sen timent (e.g #sucks in the example above), 2 ?most likely sentiment (e.g., #notcute), 3 ? contextdependent sentiment (e.g., #shoutsout), 4 ? fo cused sentiment (e.g., #tmobilesucks where the target of the sentiment is part of the hashtag), and 5 ? no sentiment (e.g. #obama).</S>
			<S sid="127" ssid="24">Table 1 shows annotation results and the percentage of similarly assigned values for each category.</S>
			<S sid="128" ssid="25">We selected 50 hashtags annotated ?1?</S>
			<S sid="129" ssid="26">or ?2?by both judges.</S>
			<S sid="130" ssid="27">For each of these tags we automatically sampled 1000 tweets resulting in 50000 la beled tweets.</S>
			<S sid="131" ssid="28">We avoided sampling tweets which include more than one of the sampled hashtags.</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="29">As a no-sentiment dataset we randomly sampled 10000 tweets with no hashtags/smileys from thewhole dataset assuming that such a random sam ple is unlikely to contain a significant amount of sentiment sentences.</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="30">4.3 Smiley-based sentiment labels.</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="31">While there exist many ?official?</S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="32">lists of possibleASCII smileys, most of these smileys are infrequent or not commonly accepted and used as sen timent indicators by online communities.</S>
			<S sid="136" ssid="33">We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) service in order to obtain a list of the most commonly used and unambiguous ASCII smileys.</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="34">We asked each of ten AMT human subjects to provide at least 6 commonly used ASCII mood-indicating smileystogether with one or more single-word descrip tions of the smiley-related mood state.</S>
			<S sid="138" ssid="35">From the obtained list of smileys we selected a subset of 15 smileys which were (1) provided by at least threehuman subjects, (2) described by at least two human subject using the same single-word descrip tion, and (3) appear at least 1000 times in our Twitter dataset.</S>
			<S sid="139" ssid="36">We then sampled 1000 tweets foreach of these smileys, using these smileys as sentiment tags in the sentiment classification frame work described in the previous section.</S>

	<SECTION title="Evaluation and Results. " number="5">
			<S sid="140" ssid="1">The purpose of our evaluation was to learn how well our framework can identify and distinguishbetween sentiment types defined by tags or smileys and to test if our framework can be successfully used to identify sentiment types in new un tagged sentences.</S>
			<S sid="141" ssid="2">5.1 Evaluation using cross-validation.</S>
			<S sid="142" ssid="3">In the first experiment we evaluated the consistency and quality of sentiment classification us ing cross-validation over the training set.</S>
			<S sid="143" ssid="4">Fullyautomated evaluation allowed us to test the performance of our algorithm under several dif ferent feature settings: Pn+W-M-Pt-, Pn+W+M-Pt-, Pn+W+M+Pt-, Pn-W-M-Pt+ and FULL, where +/?</S>
			<S sid="144" ssid="5">stands for utilization/omission of the followingfeature types: Pn:punctuation, W:Word, M:n grams (M stands for ?multi?), Pt:patterns.</S>
			<S sid="145" ssid="6">FULL stands for utilization of all feature types.</S>
			<S sid="146" ssid="7">In this experimental setting, the training set was divided to 10 parts and a 10-fold cross validation test is executed.</S>
			<S sid="147" ssid="8">Each time, we use 9 parts as thelabeled training data for feature selection and con struction of labeled vectors and the remaining part is used as a test set.</S>
			<S sid="148" ssid="9">The process was repeated tentimes.</S>
			<S sid="149" ssid="10">To avoid utilization of labels as strong fea tures in the test set, we removed all instances of involved label hashtags/smileys from the tweets used as the test set.</S>

			<S sid="153" ssid="14">Multi-class classification.</S>
			<S sid="154" ssid="15">Under multi-class classification we attempt to assign a single label (51 labels in case of hashtags and 16 labels in case of smileys) to each of vectors in the test set.</S>
			<S sid="155" ssid="16">Note that the random baseline for this task is 0.02 (0.06)for hashtags (smileys).</S>
			<S sid="156" ssid="17">Table 2 shows the perfor mance of our framework for these tasks.</S>
			<S sid="157" ssid="18">Results are significantly above the random baseline and definitely nontrivial considering theequal class sizes in the test set.</S>
			<S sid="158" ssid="19">While still relatively low (0.31 for hashtags and 0.64 for smi leys), we observe much better performance forsmileys which is expected due to the lower num ber of sentiment types.</S>
			<S sid="159" ssid="20">The relatively low performance of hashtags can be explained by ambiguity of the hashtags andsome overlap of sentiments.</S>
			<S sid="160" ssid="21">Examination of clas sified sentences reveals that many of them can be reasonably assigned to more than one of the available hashtags or smileys.</S>
			<S sid="161" ssid="22">Thus a tweet ?I?mreading stuff that I DON?T understand again!</S>
			<S sid="162" ssid="23">ha haha...wth am I doing?</S>
			<S sid="163" ssid="24">may reasonably matchtags #sarcasm, #damn, #haha, #lol, #humor, #an gry etc. Close examination of the incorrectly classified examples also reveals that substantialamount of tweets utilize hashtags to explicitly in dicate the specific hashtagged sentiment, in these cases that no sentiment value could be perceived by readers unless indicated explicitly, e.g. ?De Blob game review posted on our blog.</S>

			<S sid="165" ssid="26">Obviously, our framework fails to process such cases and captures noise since no sentiment datais present in the processed text labeled with a spe cific sentiment label.Binary classification.</S>

			<S sid="170" ssid="31">Table 3 shows averaged results for this case and specific results for selected tags.</S>
			<S sid="171" ssid="32">We can see thatour framework successfully identifies diverse sentiment types.</S>
			<S sid="172" ssid="33">Obviously the results are much bet ter than those of multi-class classification, and the observed &gt; 0.8 precision confirms the usefulnessof the proposed framework for sentiment classifi cation of a variety of different sentiment types.</S>
			<S sid="173" ssid="34">We can see that even for binary classification settings, classification of smiley-labeled sentencesis a substantially easier task compared to classifi cation of hashtag-labeled tweets.</S>
			<S sid="174" ssid="35">Comparing the contributed performance of different feature typeswe can see that punctuation, word and pattern features, each provide a substantial boost for classi fication quality while we observe only a marginalboost when adding n-grams as classification features.</S>
			<S sid="175" ssid="36">We can also see that pattern features contribute the performance more than all other fea tures together.</S>
			<S sid="176" ssid="37">5.2 Evaluation with human judges.</S>
			<S sid="177" ssid="38">In the second set of experiments we evaluated our framework on a test set of unseen and untaggedtweets (thus tweets that were not part of the train 6Note that this is a useful application in itself, as a filter that extracts sentiment sentences from a corpus for further focused study/processing.</S>
			<S sid="178" ssid="39">246 ing data), comparing its output to tags assigned by human judges.</S>
			<S sid="179" ssid="40">We applied our framework with its FULL setting, learning the sentiment tags fromthe training set for hashtags and smileys (sepa rately) and executed the framework on the reduced Tweeter dataset (without untagged data) allowingit to identify at least five sentences for each senti ment class.In order to make the evaluation harsher, we re moved all tweets containing at least one of the relevant classification hashtags (or smileys).</S>
			<S sid="180" ssid="41">For each of the resulting 250 sentences for hashtags,and 75 sentences for smileys we generated an ?as signment task?.</S>
			<S sid="181" ssid="42">Each task presents a human judgewith a sentence and a list of ten possible hash tags.</S>
			<S sid="182" ssid="43">One tag from this list was provided by ouralgorithm, 8 other tags were sampled from the re maining 49 (14) available sentiment tags, and the tenth tag is from the list of frequent non-sentiment tags (e.g. travel or obama).</S>
			<S sid="183" ssid="44">The human judge was requested to select the 0-2 most appropriate tags from the list.</S>
			<S sid="184" ssid="45">Allowing assignment of multiple tags conforms to the observation that even short sentences may express several different sentimenttypes and to the observation that some of the selected sentiment tags might express similar senti ment types.</S>
			<S sid="185" ssid="46">We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk service to present the tasks to English-speaking subjects.Each subject was given 50 tasks for Twitter hash tags or 25 questions for smileys.</S>
			<S sid="186" ssid="47">To ensure the quality of assignments, we added to each test fivemanually selected, clearly sentiment bearing, as signment tasks from the tagged Twitter sentences used in the training set.</S>
			<S sid="187" ssid="48">Each set was presented to four subjects.</S>
			<S sid="188" ssid="49">If a human subject failed to provide the intended ?correct?</S>
			<S sid="189" ssid="50">answer to at least two of the control set questions we reject him/her from the calculation.</S>
			<S sid="190" ssid="51">In our evaluation the algorithmis considered to be correct if one of the tags se lected by a human judge was also selected by thealgorithm.</S>
			<S sid="191" ssid="52">Table 4 shows results for human judge ment classification.</S>
			<S sid="192" ssid="53">The agreement score for this task was ? = 0.41 (we consider agreement when at least one of two selected items are shared).</S>
			<S sid="193" ssid="54">Table 4 shows that the majority of tags selectedby humans matched those selected by the algo rithm.</S>
			<S sid="194" ssid="55">Precision of smiley tags is substantially Setup % Correct % No sentiment Control Smileys 84% 6% 92% Hashtags 77% 10% 90%Table 4: Results of human evaluation.</S>

			<S sid="198" ssid="59">higher than of hashtag labels, due to the lessernumber of possible smileys and the lesser ambi guity of smileys in comparison to hashtags.</S>
			<S sid="199" ssid="60">5.3 Exploration of feature dependencies.</S>
			<S sid="200" ssid="61">Our algorithm assigns a single sentiment type for each tweet.</S>
			<S sid="201" ssid="62">However, as discussed above, some sentiment types overlap (e.g., #awesome and #amazing).</S>
			<S sid="202" ssid="63">Many sentences may express several types of sentiment (e.g., #fun and #scary in ?Oh My God http://goo.gl/fb/K2N5z #entertainment #fun #pictures #photography #scary #teaparty?).</S>
			<S sid="203" ssid="64">We would like to estimate such inter-sentiment dependencies and overlap automatically from the labeled data.</S>
			<S sid="204" ssid="65">We use two different methods for overlap estimation: tag co-occurrence and feature overlap.</S>
			<S sid="205" ssid="66">5.3.1 Tag co-occurrenceMany tweets contain more than a single hashtag or a single smiley type.</S>
			<S sid="206" ssid="67">As mentioned, we ex clude such tweets from the training set to reduce ambiguity.</S>
			<S sid="207" ssid="68">However such tag co-appearances canbe used for sentiment overlap estimation.</S>
			<S sid="208" ssid="69">We cal culated the relative co-occurrence frequencies of some hashtags and smileys.</S>
			<S sid="209" ssid="70">Table 5 shows some of the observed co-appearance ratios.</S>
			<S sid="210" ssid="71">As expected some of the observed tags frequently co-appear with other similar tags.</S>
			<S sid="211" ssid="72">247 Hashtags #happy #sad #crazy # bored#sad 12.8 - - #crazy 14.2 3.5 - #bored 2.4 11.1 2.1 #fun 19.6 2.1 15 4.4 Smileys :) ; ) : ( X(; ) 35.9 - - : ( 31.9 10.5 - X( 8.1 10.2 36 : S 10.5 12.6 21.6 6.1 Table 6: Percentage of shared features in feature vectors for different tags.</S>
			<S sid="212" ssid="73">Interestingly, it appears that a relatively high ratio of co-appearance of tags is with opposite meanings (e.g., ?#ilove eating but #ihate feeling fat lol?</S>
			<S sid="213" ssid="74">or ?happy days of training going to end in a few days #sad #happy?).</S>
			<S sid="214" ssid="75">This is possibly due to frequently expressed contrast sentiment types in the same sentence ? a fascinating phenomenareflecting the great complexity of the human emo tional state (and expression).</S>
			<S sid="215" ssid="76">5.3.2 Feature overlapIn our framework we have created a set of fea ture vectors for each of the Twitter sentiment tags.</S>
			<S sid="216" ssid="77">Comparison of shared features in feature vector sets allows us to estimate dependencies betweendifferent sentiment types even when direct tag cooccurrence data is very sparse.</S>
			<S sid="217" ssid="78">A feature is considered to be shared between two different senti ment labels if for both sentiment labels there is at least a single example in the training set whichhas a positive value of this feature.</S>
			<S sid="218" ssid="79">In order to automatically analyze such dependencies we calcu late the percentage of sharedWord/n-gram/Pattern features between different sentiment labels.</S>
			<S sid="219" ssid="80">Table 6 shows the observed feature overlap values for selected sentiment tags.</S>
			<S sid="220" ssid="81">We observe the trend of results obtained by comparison of shared feature vectors is similar to those obtained by means of label co-occurrence, although the numbers of the shared features arehigher.</S>
			<S sid="221" ssid="82">These results, demonstrating the patternbased similarity of conflicting, sometimes contradicting, emotions are interesting from a psycho logical and cognitive perspective.</S>

	<SECTION title="Conclusion. " number="6">
			<S sid="222" ssid="1">We presented a framework which allows an au tomatic identification and classification of various sentiment types in short text fragments which isbased on Twitter data.</S>
			<S sid="223" ssid="2">Our framework is a su pervised classification one which utilizes Twitterhashtags and smileys as training labels.</S>
			<S sid="224" ssid="3">The substantial coverage and size of the processed Twitter data allowed us to identify dozens of senti ment types without any labor-intensive manuallylabeled training sets or pre-provided sentiment specific features or sentiment words.We evaluated diverse feature types for senti ment extraction including punctuation, patterns,words and n-grams, confirming that each feature type contributes to the sentiment classifica tion framework.</S>
			<S sid="225" ssid="4">We also proposed two different methods which allow an automatic identification of sentiment type overlap and inter-dependencies.In the future these methods can be used for automated clustering of sentiment types and senti ment dependency rules.</S>
			<S sid="226" ssid="5">While hashtag labels arespecific to Twitter data, the obtained feature vectors are not heavily Twitter-specific and in the fu ture we would like to explore the applicability ofTwitter data for sentiment multi-class identifica tion and classification in other domains.</S>
